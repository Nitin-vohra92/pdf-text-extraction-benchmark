Varieties of pairs of nilpotent matrices annihilating each other

Introduction and main results

Let Mn(K) be the set of n  ×  n-matrices with entries in an algebraically closed field K. The study of affine varieties given by matrices or pairs of matrices, which satisfy certain relations, is a classical subject. One fundamental question is the decomposition of these varieties into irreducible components. Consider the varieties

[formula]

and

[formula]

The variety N(n,l) is irreducible by [\cite=Ge] and [\cite=H], and the irreducible components of Z(n) are

[formula]

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. For n,a,b  ≥  2 define

[formula]

Our main result is the classification of irreducible components of V(n,a,b). This question appears for a  =  b  =  n as an open problem in [\cite=K]. In this special case, we get the following surprising result:

Thus each irreducible component of V(n,n,n) is the intersection of an irreducible component of Z(n) with N(n,n)  ×  N(n,n). The case a = b = 2 and n arbitrary was studied in [\cite=M].

A partition of n is a sequence [formula] of positive integers such that [formula] and pi  ≥  pi + 1 for all i. Let [formula] be the length of [formula]. The set of partitions [formula] of n with pi  ≤  a for all i is denoted by P(n,a).

By [formula] we denote the usual dominance order on P(n,a), see Section [\ref=sectionregcomp] for a definition.

The conjugacy classes of matrices in N(n,a) are parametrized by P(n,a). Namely, for a matrix M∈N(n,a), let J(M) be its Jordan normal form, and set [formula] where the pi are the sizes of the Jordan blocks of J(M), ordered decreasingly. Clearly, we have p(M)∈P(n,a). For [formula] let

[formula]

be the corresponding conjugacy class in N(n,a).

There are two projection maps

[formula]

where π1(A,B)  =  A and π2(A,B)  =  B. For [formula] let

[formula]

In general, [formula] is not irreducible. Only if a = b = n, these sets have nice properties:

For the study of the general case, define the standard stratification of V(n,a,b) as follows: Let

[formula]

For [formula] let

[formula]

be the corresponding stratum of the standard stratification. Unfortunately, these strata are in general not very well-behaved:

A stratum might be empty;

Strata are not necessarily irreducible;

The closure of a stratum is in general not a union of strata.

However, the socalled 'regular strata' have nice properties. Observe that for (A,B)∈V(n,a,b) the inequality

[formula]

holds. This follows already from the condition AB  =  0. We call (A,B) regular if [formula]. An irreducible component of V(n,a,b) is regular if it contains a regular element, and we call [formula] and also its corresponding stratum [formula] regular if [formula] contains a regular element.

For a partition [formula] define

[formula]

where r  =   max {1  ≤  i  ≤  t|pi  ≥  2}. For example,

[formula]

The following result determines which strata are regular.

If [formula] is a partition, then let

[formula]

be the number of entries of [formula] which are equal to i. The next theorem yields a classification of all regular irreducible components.

Next, we determine when all irreducible components of V(n,a,b) are regular.

The classification of the non-regular irreducible components of V(n,a,b) is more complicated and needs more notation. We state and prove the result in Section [\ref=sectionnonregcomp].

The paper is organized as follows: In Section [\ref=varieties] we repeat some basics on varieties of modules. In particular, we recall Richmond's construction of a stratification of these varieties, which we will use throughout. We regard V(n,a,b) as a variety of modules over a Gelfand-Ponomarev algebra, and we use module theory to classify the irreducible components of V(n,a,b). Section [\ref=stringalgebras] is a collection of mostly known results on Gelfand-Ponomarev algebras. Richmond's stratification turns out to be finite for V(n,a,b). This is studied in Section [\ref=indexsection]. In Section [\ref=sectionregcomp] we prove that all regular strata are irreducible. This is used in Section [\ref=nilcase1] to prove Theorem [\ref=nil2]. The classification of all regular components of V(n,a,b) can be found in Section [\ref=classregcomp]. Theorem [\ref=nil1] is proved at the end of Section [\ref=classregcomp]. The main result of Section [\ref=sectionnonregcomp] is the classification of all non-regular components of V(n,a,b). Finally, some examples are given in Section [\ref=examples].

Varieties of modules

Let A be a finitely generated K-algebra. Fix a set [formula] of generators of A. By [formula] we denote the affine variety of A-module structures on Kn. Each such A-module structure corresponds to a K-algebra homomorphism A  →  Mn(K), or equivalently to a tuple [formula] of n  ×  n-matrices such that the Mi satisfy the same relations as the ai. The group GLn(K) acts by simultaneous conjugation on [formula], and the orbits of this action are in 1-1 correspondence with the isomorphism classes of n-dimensional A-modules. An orbit O(X) of a module X has dimension [formula]. If O(X) is contained in the closure of an orbit O(Y), then we write Y  ≤   degX. It is well known that Y  ≤   degX implies [formula] for all modules M, see for example [\cite=Bo]. If

[formula]

is a short exact sequence, then [formula]. If there exists a module Z and a short exact sequence

[formula]

then it is proved in [\cite=Rie] that Y  ≤   degX. The converse is also true by [\cite=Z]. Short exact sequences of this form are called Riedtmann sequences. We call a module X a minimal degeneration if there exists no module Y with Y  <   degX.

Now, let A be a finite-dimensional K-algebra, and let IA(n) be a set of representatives of isomorphism classes of submodules of An which have dimension n(d - 1) where d  =   dim  (A). The modules in IA(n) are called the index modules of A. For each L∈IA(n) let S(L) be the set of points [formula] such that there exists a short exact sequence

[formula]

of A-modules. Such a set S(L) is called a stratum. Note that [formula] is the disjoint union of the S(L) where L runs through IA(n). The following theorem can be found in [\cite=R].

Unfortunately, the converse of the second part of this theorem is usually wrong. So it remains a difficult problem to decide when a stratum is contained in the closure of another stratum. Another problem is, that the set IA(n) is often infinite. Following [\cite=R] an algebra A is called subfinite if IA(n) is finite for all n.

Gelfand-Ponomarev algebras

We identify V(n,a,b) with the variety of n-dimensional modules over the algebra

[formula]

We call Λ a Gelfand-Ponomarev algebra.

The group GLn(K) acts on [formula] by simultaneous conjugation, i.e.

[formula]

The orbits of this action are in 1-1 correspondence with the isomorphism classes of n-dimensional Λ-modules. By O(M) we denote the orbit of an element M∈V(n,a,b).

In the following we repeat Gelfand and Ponomarev's classification of indecomposable Λ-modules (by a 'module' we always mean a finite-dimensional right module). As a main reference we use [\cite=GP], but see also [\cite=BR].

A string of length n  ≥  1 is a word [formula] with letters ci∈{x,y} such that no subword is of the form xa or yb. Additionally, we define a string 1 of length 0. Set x0  =  y0  =  1.

The length of an arbitrary string C is denoted by |C|. Let [formula] and [formula] be strings of length at least one. If [formula] is a string, then we say that the concatenation of C and D is defined. For an arbitrary string C let 1C  =  C1  =  C.

For each string C we construct a string module M(C) over Λ as follows: First, assume that n  =  |C|  ≥  1. Fix a basis [formula] of M(C). Given an arrow α∈{x,y} let

[formula]

For C  =  1 let S  =  M(C) be the one-dimensional module with basis {z1} such that z1  ·  x  =  z1  ·  y  =  0. This is the unique simple Λ-module. The zi are called the canonical basis vectors of M(C).

For example, let C  =  xxyxy. Then the string module M(C) looks as in Figure [\ref=fig1], where [formula] are the canonical basis vectors of M(C), and the arrows indicate how the generators x and y of Λ operate on these basis vectors. Set (A,B)  =  M(xxyxy). We have

[formula]

A string [formula] of length at least one is called a band if all powers Cm are defined. Next, we associate to a given band [formula] and some n  ≥  1 a family

[formula]

of band modules. Fix a basis [formula] of [formula]. For α∈{x,y} define

[formula]

and let

[formula]

For 2  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1 and 1  ≤  j  ≤  n we define

[formula]

The zij are called the canonical basis vectors of [formula].

For example, let B  =  xxyxy. Then the band module M(B,λ1,λ2) looks as in Figure [\ref=fig2]. The arrows in Figure [\ref=fig2] indicate how the generators x and y of Λ operate on the canonical basis vectors of M(B,λ1,λ2). For example, z51  ·  y  =  λ1z11, z52  ·  y  =  λ2z12  +  z11, z32  ·  y  =  z42 etc.

The next lemma is proved by straightforward base change calculations.

If λi  =  λj for all i and j, then define [formula], compare [\cite=BR].

A band B is called periodic if there exists some string C such that B  =  Cm for some m  ≥  2. A band is called primitive if it is not periodic. For primitive bands B1 and B2 define B1  ~  B2 if B1  =  BB' and B2  =  B'B for some strings B and B'. Let S be the set of strings, and let B be a set of representatives of equivalence classes of primitive bands with respect to the equivalence relation ~  . The following theorem is proved in [\cite=GP].

The next lemma follows from the construction of string and band modules and from Theorem [\ref=indecomposables].

Let [formula] be bands. For positive integers [formula] set

[formula]

Define a morphism of varieties

[formula]

[formula]

The image of this morphism is denoted by

[formula]

We say that F is a p-parametric family. In case pi  =  1 for some i, we write also just Bi instead of (Bi,pi). It follows from [\cite=Kr] that  dim  O(y) is constant for all y in a given family F. The following lemma is straightforward.

A band module M(B,λ,n) is obviously contained in the closure of the set of all band modules [formula] where the λi are pairwise different.

For a string C define

[formula]

We call (D,E,F)∈P(C) a factor string of C if the following hold:

Either D = 1 or [formula] where dn  =  x;

Either F = 1 or [formula] where f1  =  y.

Dually, we call (D,E,F) a substring of C if the following hold:

Either D = 1 or [formula] where dn  =  y;

Either F = 1 or [formula] where f1  =  x.

Let fac(C) be the set of factor strings of C, and by sub(C) we denote the set of substrings of C. For strings C1 and C2 let

[formula]

For example, if C1  =  xxy and C2  =  xyxx, then

[formula]

For each a  =  ((D1,E1,F1),(D2,E2,F2))∈A(C1,C2) we define a homomorphism

[formula]

as follows: Define

[formula]

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  |E1| + 1, and all other canonical basis vectors of M(C1) are mapped to 0. Such homomorphisms are called graph maps. The following theorem is a special case of the main result in [\cite=CB].

There is the following multiplicative behaviour of graph maps: Let fa:M(C1)  →  M(C2) and fb:M(C2)  →  M(C3) be graph maps. Then the composition fafb:M(C1)  →  M(C3) is either 0 or a graph map.

Index modules of Gelfand-Ponomarev algebras

A module M is called biserial if it is isomorphic to

[formula]

where 0  ≤  i  ≤  a - 1 and 0  ≤  j  ≤  b - 1. For example, Λ regarded as a module over itself is isomorphic to the biserial module M(xa - 1yb - 1). Note also that any projective Λ-module is isomorphic to Λn for some n  ≥  1.

Any Gelfand-Ponomarev algebra Λ is a monomial algebra. Thus by [\cite=ZH], if U is a submodule of a projective Λ-module, then

[formula]

It follows from the description of indecomposable Λ-modules that the biserial modules are the only Λ-modules which have this property.

A case by case analysis shows the following:

We have [formula] and so [formula] for any projective module P. Each indecomposable non-projective direct summand of L is of the form M(xiyj) with 0  ≤  i  ≤  a - 2 and 0  ≤  j  ≤  b - 2. We have

[formula]

This can be checked directly or by applying [\cite=CB]. Since  dim(L)  =  n(d - 1), the result follows.

One can easily construct a short exact sequence

[formula]

A degeneration of the same form as in the previous lemma is called a flip degeneration. (We 'flip' q and j.) An index module L is called flip minimal if it is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form

[formula]

such that ci  ≥  ci + 1, di  ≥  di + 1, 0  ≤  ci  ≤  a - 2 and 0  ≤  di  ≤  b - 2 for all i. It follows from the previous two lemmas that for any index module L there exists a chain

[formula]

of flip degenerations of index modules with L1 being flip minimal and

[formula]

for all i.

One can construct a short exact sequence

[formula]

A degeneration of the same form as in the above lemma is called a box move degeneration. The modules over K / (xn) correspond to partitions, or equivalently to Young diagrams, and the degenerations of these modules are given by moving boxes of the Young diagrams. We are in a similar situation here. Note that Lemma [\ref=boxmovedegeneration] has an obvious dual version, exchanging the roles of x and y.

Regular strata are irreducible

For a partition [formula] let [formula] be its corresponding Young diagram, which has pi boxes in the ith column. For example, the Young diagram Y(3,2,2,1) looks as in Figure [\ref=fig3]. For a partition [formula] the dual partition is defined as [formula], where the rj are the number of boxes in the rows of the Young diagram [formula], ordered decreasingly. For example,

[formula]

Now let A∈N(n,a) with [formula]. Then the boxes of the Young diagram [formula] can be considered as a certain basis of Kn, and A can be considered as an endomorphism of Kn. If b is a box such that there is a box b' below b, then A maps b to b', and b is mapped to 0, otherwise. Figure [\ref=fig3.1] illustrates this for p(A)  =  (3,2,2,1), where the arrows indicate how A acts on the boxes. Now let [formula] be the dual partition of [formula]. Then [formula], [formula] etc.

If [formula] and [formula] are arbitrary partitions, then define [formula] if

[formula]

for all l, where we set pi  =  0 and qj  =  0 for all [formula] and [formula]. This partial order is usually called the dominance order. The proof of the following proposition can be found in [\cite=Ge], see also [\cite=H].

Recall that we defined two maps

[formula]

with π1(A,B)  =  A and π2(A,B)  =  B, and for [formula] we set

[formula]

Thus, as a consequence of Proposition [\ref=nilvariety] we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. In particular, [formula] and [formula] are locally closed in V(n,a,b).

The following lemma is an easy exercise.

Let (A,B)∈V(n,a,b), and set

[formula]

Assume that (A,B) is regular, i.e. [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=basic1] this is equivalent to [formula]. Thus, if [formula] contains a regular element, then all elements in [formula] are regular. We know that (A,B) is isomorphic to a direct sum of band modules. But any band is (up to equivalence) of the form [formula] with ci,di  ≥  1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  t. This implies that the number of entries which are at least 2 in [formula] is equal to the number of entries which are at least 2 in [formula]. In other words, [formula]. Conversely, if [formula] with [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], then set

[formula]

Clearly, we have [formula], [formula], and (A,B) (and therefore also [formula]) is regular. This finishes the proof.

Altogether, we get that for a regular (A,B)∈V(n,a,b) the following are equivalent:

[formula];

[formula];

[formula];

[formula];

l(p(A) - 1)  =  p;

l(p(B) - 1)  =  p.

Example: Let (A,B)  =  M(xxyxy,λ). Then p(A)  =  (3,2) and p(B)  =  (2,2,1). Thus, l(p(A) - 1)  =  l(2,1)  =  2 and l(p(B) - 1)  =  l(1,1)  =  2. It is also clear that M(xxyxy,λ) has a 2-dimensional socle and a 2-dimensional top. As an illustration, see Figure [\ref=fig4].

The next lemma follows directly from the construction of projective covers of indecomposable Λ-modules. These covers are easy to construct.

A Λ-module is called a diamond module if it is isomorphic to M(xiyj,λ) for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  a - 1 and 1  ≤  j  ≤  b - 1. Thus the diamond modules are the band modules with simple top (and therefore also with simple socle). We now associate to any regular element [formula] a diamond family [formula] which consists of direct sums of diamond modules.

Let [formula] be regular. Thus, [formula] by Proposition [\ref=regularstrata]. Assume that [formula] and [formula]. Let

[formula]

Thus every module in [formula] is isomorphic to

[formula]

for some pairwise different λi. For example, a module in

[formula]

looks as in Figure [\ref=fig5], where the points are just the basis vectors of the module. Note that [formula].

Let [formula] be regular. Thus (A,B) is in some stratum S(L) with L a direct sum of n indecomposable modules, and exactly [formula] of them are projective, see Lemma [\ref=indexsummands]. By Lemma [\ref=dimhomindextoproj] we get

[formula]

where d  =   dim(Λ). Assume [formula] and [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=regularstrata] each module in [formula] is isomorphic to a direct sum of band modules, and one checks easily that L  =  (E,F) with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Define

[formula]

We apply a sequence of flip degenerations to L and get

[formula]

with

[formula]

Then Theorem [\ref=richmond],(3) yields that the stratum [formula] is dense in [formula]. By [\ref=richmond],(1) we get that [formula] is irreducible. Observe that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. This follows from Lemma [\ref=dimensionoffamilies], the dimension formula for orbits and [\cite=Kr]. Using the dimension formula in Theorem [\ref=richmond],(1) and applying [\cite=CB] we get

[formula]

This implies that [formula] is dense in [formula].

Thus, from the above proposition we get the remarkable result that the diamond families form a dense subset in the set of all regular elements in V(n,a,b).

The nilpotent case

The following is easy to prove.

There exists a short exact sequence

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Then we use Lemma [\ref=nonreg3],(2).

Set

[formula]

and let [formula]. Thus (C,D) is isomorphic to a module

[formula]

where M  =  0 or M is a direct sum of band modules. There are three cases to consider: First, if s  ≥  2, then

[formula]

Second, if s = 1 and [formula] for some l  ≥  0, then

[formula]

Finally, assume that s = 1 and C1  =  yl for some l  ≥  0. Since [formula], this implies l  <  n - 1 and thus [formula]. Using Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds] we can assume without loss of generality that M is a direct sum of diamond modules. Let M(xiyj,λ) be one of these direct summands, thus [formula] for some M'. Then we use Lemma [\ref=stringreduction] and get

[formula]

Note that we used several times our assumption a = b = n by assuming that certain words in x and y are actually strings, i.e. that they do not contain subwords of the form xa or yb. This finishes the proof.

It is straightforward to construct a short exact sequence

[formula]

Let [formula] be regular with

[formula]

and

[formula]

The diamond family [formula] is dense in [formula] by Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds], and each module in [formula] is of the form

[formula]

for some λj. Since a  =  b  =  n, we know that xn - iyi is a string for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. Now we use Lemma [\ref=degoftopsocleonemodules] and get that

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

Then Corollary [\ref=stringreduction2] implies

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds] we get

[formula]

This finishes the proof.

Classification of regular irreducible components

If [formula] with [formula] and [formula], then we write [formula]. This defines a partial order on P(n,a,b).

For all regular pairs [formula] we have [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula], and from [formula] we get [formula]. This implies [formula] and [formula].

The next lemma is a consequence of Proposition [\ref=nilvariety].

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

In particular, Vpi,reg(n,a,b) is locally closed.

If [formula] does not hold, then we apply Lemma [\ref=strataintersection] and get

[formula]

Next, assume that [formula] holds. By Lemma [\ref=indexsummands] each element in Vpi,reg belongs to some stratum of the form S(L) with L a direct sum of n indecomposables, and exactly n  -  p of these are projective. Since [formula] and [formula], there exists a chain

[formula]

of box move degenerations between index modules such that [formula] is constant for all Li in this chain. Now we use the same arguments as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds], and finally we apply Theorem [\ref=richmond],(3). This finishes the proof.

An element [formula] is called (i,p)-maximal if it is maximal in Ppi,reg(n,a,b) with respect to the partial order [formula]. Clearly, each non-empty Ppi,reg(n,a,b) contains a unique (i,p)-maximal element.

It follows easily that an element [formula] is (i,p)-maximal if and only if the following hold:

[formula] has at most one entry different from 1, 2 and a;

[formula] has at most one entry different from 1, 2 and b.

As a consequence of Propositions [\ref=reductiontodiamonds] and [\ref=vpiisirreducible] we get the following:

We characterize the (i,p)-maximal elements [formula] such that the closure of [formula] is an irreducible component. By the preceding results, these are then all regular irreducible components. Assume that [formula] is (i,p)-maximal. Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

where 0  ≤  v  ≤  a - 2, 0  ≤  w  ≤  b - 2, 0  ≤  r,s  ≤  p - 1, v = 0  ⇒  r = 0 and w = 0  ⇒  s = 0. By Corollary [\ref=cor7.4] we have

[formula]

We claim that the closure of [formula] is an irreducible component if and only if r + s + 1  ≤  p.

First, let r + s + 1  >  p. This implies that there exist u1,u2,v1,v2  ≥  1 such that each module in [formula] has a direct summand isomorphic to

[formula]

where u1 + u2  ≤  a - 1 and v1 + v2  ≤  b - 1. Now we apply Lemma [\ref=degoftopsocleonemodules] and see that [formula] is contained in the closure of some other family [formula]. In particular, the closure of [formula] cannot be an irreducible component. This proves one direction of the statement.

Second, assume that r + s + 1  ≤  p. Since the function [formula] is lower semicontinuous, Vpi,reg cannot be contained in the closure of some Vqj,reg with [formula]. It is also clear that Vpi,reg cannot be in the closure of Vqj,reg if p  <  q. Because in that case, we have

[formula]

for all M∈Vpi,reg and all N∈Vqj,reg. This is a contradiction to the upper semicontinuity of the function [formula].

Thus, assume that i  =  j, p  >  q and r + s + 1  ≤  p. Then the dimension formula in Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds] yields

[formula]

Again this implies that Vpi,reg cannot be in the closure of Vqj,reg. Thus the closure of Vpi,reg must be an irreducible component. Finally, note that [formula] if and only if r + s + 1  ≤  p. This finishes the proof.

Let [formula] be a partition of n. If [formula], then [formula] is the union of the orbits of n-dimensional modules of the form

[formula]

and O(M(yn - 1)) is dense in [formula]. Thus [formula] is irreducible and

[formula]

Next, assume that [formula]. Thus [formula] for some 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1. Then there exists a unique maximal (with respect to [formula]) partition [formula] such that [formula] is regular. Namely, we have [formula] where

[formula]

Here we use our assumption a = b = n. By Proposition [\ref=vpiisirreducible], we know that for any regular element [formula] we have

[formula]

Now, assume that [formula] is non-regular with [formula] non-empty. It follows from Lemma [\ref=stringreduction3] that

[formula]

for some regular [formula].

This proves that [formula] has [formula] as a dense subset. Thus [formula] is irreducible.

Recall that for regular elements, [formula] implies [formula], see Lemma [\ref=regpairs]. Using Lemma [\ref=strataintersection], we get that

[formula]

implies [formula] and [formula]. Conversely, assume [formula] and [formula]. This implies [formula] and [formula]. We get

[formula]

by applying Lemma [\ref=degoftopsocleonemodules] in case [formula], or Proposition [\ref=vpiisirreducible] in case [formula]. This finishes the proof.

Classification of non-regular irreducible components

The classification of irreducible components of V(n,a,b) with a  <  n and b  <  n is less straightforward than for the case a  =  b = n. The main reason is that Corollary [\ref=stringreduction2] does not hold in the general case.

A module M is semi-projective (respectively semi-injective) if it is isomorphic to

[formula]

where Ci  =  xa - 1Ci'yb - 1 for some string Ci' and all i (respectively Ci  =  yb - 1Ci'xa - 1 for some string Ci' and all i). The next two statements are clear.

The next lemma is again a consequence of the construction of projective covers of string modules.

Let

[formula]

be semi-projective. We have M∈S(L) for some index module L. By Lemma [\ref=semiprojinj] we have

[formula]

Now assume that S(L) is contained in the closure of some stratum [formula] with [formula] regular. So [formula]. Since [formula] is regular, we get

[formula]

This is a contradiction because the function [formula] is upper semicontinuous.

Lemma [\ref=semiproj] enables us to determine when all irreducible components of V(n,a,b) are regular, i.e we can prove Proposition [\ref=regulardense].

If n  ≤  a + b - 2 or n  =  a + b, then there are no semi-projective or semi-injective modules. So Lemma [\ref=nonreg1] implies the result. For the other direction, it is sufficient to construct for each n  ≥  a + b + 1 and for n  =  a + b - 1 an n-dimensional semi-projective module. We leave this as an easy exercise to the reader. Then Lemma [\ref=semiproj] yields the result.

Let B  =  xcyd for some 1  ≤  c  ≤  a - 1 and 1  ≤  d  ≤  b - 1, and let

[formula]

where 1  ≤  ci  ≤  a - 1 and 1  ≤  di  ≤  b - 1 for all i, c1  =  a - 1 and dt  =  b - 1. Note that M(C) is semi-projective. Let m be the maximal i such that one of the following hold:

ci  >  c;

ci  =  c and di - 1  <  d;

i  =  1.

First, we assume that there exists some i  ≥  m such that di  <  d. Note that this implies i  <  t. Then it follows from the definition of m that ci + 1  <  c. Define

[formula]

Now it is easy to construct a short exact sequence

[formula]

This implies [formula].

Second, we consider the case di  ≥  d for all i  ≥  m. Let l be maximal such that

[formula]

for some string D. Define

[formula]

Again, one can construct a short exact sequence

[formula]

which implies [formula]. This finishes the proof.

Let Pn (respectively In) be the set of all semi-projective (respectively semi-injective) modules in V(n,a,b). Observe that Pn and In contain only finitely many isomorphism classes of modules. The next corollary follows from Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds], Lemmas [\ref=semiproj2], [\ref=nonreg1] and [\ref=reductiontosemiprojectives].

Note that the duality [formula] induces an isomorphism

[formula]

[formula]

where Mt denotes the transpose of a matrix M. For example, if (A,B) is isomorphic to M(xxy), then θ(A,B) is isomorphic to DM(xxy)  =  M(yxx). The restriction of θ to Pn yields an isomorphism Pn  →  In.

By Lemma [\ref=semiprojinj] we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some s,t  ≥  1. This implies [formula]. Thus by Theorem [\ref=richmond],(2) the stratum S(L) cannot be contained in the closure of S(M). Next, assume that S(M) is contained in the closure of S(L). This implies that θ(S(M)) is contained in the closure of θ(S(L)) with θ(S(M)) containing a semi-projective and θ(S(L)) containing a semi-injective module. But this is a contradiction to the first part of the proof.

Up to now, we established the following: To classify all non-regular irreducible components of V(n,a,b), it is sufficient to decide which orbits in Pn are open.

Let X be indecomposable and semi-projective, and assume that X is contained in a stratum S(L). We want to determine when O(X) is open. We can assume that L is flip minimal, otherwise we could use flip degenerations and Theorem [\ref=richmond] to show that S(L) and in particular X is contained in the closure of some other stratum S(M) with M being flip minimal.

Let [formula] such that the following hold:

[formula];

[formula];

[formula].

Let [formula], [formula], and define

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that [formula] is an index module in IΛ(n), and [formula] is semi-projective and contained in the stratum [formula]. Observe also that [formula]. The index module [formula] is flip minimal. Furthermore, each flip minimal index module L with S(L) containing an indecomposable semi-projective module is obtained in this way.

Using the dimension formula in Theorem [\ref=richmond],(1) and Theorem [\ref=graphmaps], a straightforward calculation shows that

[formula]

Thus [formula] must be dense in the stratum [formula].

As a consequence of the above results we get the following:

The first part of the lemma is a direct consequence of Lemma [\ref=strataintersection]. Next, one easily checks that the conditions [formula] and [formula] allow a sequence of box move degenerations

[formula]

such that [formula] for all i. As before we use Theorem [\ref=richmond],(3) and get

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] are dense in [formula] and [formula], respectively, this implies [formula]. This finishes the proof.

If a string C belongs to one of the sets (1), (2) or (3) as defined in the theorem, then we say that C is of type (1), (2) or (3), respectively.

We classify the open orbits O(X) with X indecomposable. By Lemma [\ref=nonreg1] we know that X has to be semi-projective or semi-injective. By duality, we can assume without loss of generality that X is semi-projective. As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=6.11], we can assume that [formula] such that the following hold:

[formula] has at most one entry different from 1,2 and a;

[formula] has at most one entry different from 1,2 and b.

Now we proceed similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. We can assume that [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

where 0  ≤  v  ≤  a - 2, 0  ≤  w  ≤  b - 2, 0  ≤  r,s  ≤  p - 1, v = 0  ⇒  r = 0 and w = 0  ⇒  s = 0. Then by using Theorem [\ref=graphmaps], we get

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=opencrit] the orbit of [formula] is open if and only if there is no [formula] with [formula].

If r + s + 1  ≤  p, then

[formula]

for all [formula] with [formula]. This follows from the above dimension formula. So by Lemma [\ref=6.11] the orbit [formula] must be open. Observe that C is of type (1),(2) or (3) if and only if r + s + 1  ≤  p.

Next, assume that r + s + 1  >  p. By the definition of r and s, it follows that a,b  ≥  3 in this case. Then C is of the form

[formula]

where k,m  ≥  1, l  ≥  0, 1  ≤  i  ≤  a - 2 and 1  ≤  j  ≤  b - 2. If l = 0, then define

[formula]

Otherwise, let

[formula]

In both cases, we get M(E)  <   degM(C). This is proved by constructing a Riedtmann sequence

[formula]

Thus, [formula] cannot be open. This finishes the classification of indecomposable Λ-modules whose orbit is open. The rest of the theorem follows from [\cite=Z].

For modules X and Y let (X,Y) be the space [formula] modulo the homomorphisms factoring through a projective module. By τ we denote the Auslander-Reiten translation. For indecomposable modules X and Y we have the Auslander-Reiten formula

[formula]

For the basics of Auslander-Reiten theory we refer to [\cite=ARS] or [\cite=Ri]. If M(C) is a semi-projective string module, then define

[formula]

Note that M(τ- 1C) is also semi-projective. It is proved in [\cite=BR] that

[formula]

The next proposition is an application of the Auslander-Reiten formula and Theorem [\ref=graphmaps].

For deciding whether a graph map factors through another string module, one uses the multiplicative behaviour of graph maps. Using this proposition and the previous theorem, it is now easy to compute the semi-projective modules whose orbit is open. Using duality, we get all open orbits. This completes the classification of irreducible components of the variety V(n,a,b).

Remarks and examples

We list all irreducible components of V(n,3,3) for n  ≤  12. First, let us give the list of all regular irreducible components and their dimensions.

For each regular [formula] we constructed a family [formula] of modules which is dense in [formula], see Proposition [\ref=reductiontodiamonds]. Recall that these families are of the form [formula].

In Figure [\ref=fig6] we display the data [formula] in case the closure of the corresponding family is an irreducible component. If pi  =  1, then we just write Bi instead of (Bi,pi).

In Figure [\ref=fig7] we give a list of all open orbits and their dimensions. Recall that the closures of the open orbits are exactly the non-regular irreducible components. Remember also that the open orbits are orbits of certain semi-projective or semi-injective modules. For the sake of brevity we list only the strings Ci occurring in their direct sum decomposition. For example [formula] encodes the module [formula]. We only list the semi-projective modules whose orbits are open. Thus one has to add the same number of semi-injective modules to get all open orbits. Recall that there are no open orbits for n  ≤  a + b - 2  =  4 and n  =  a + b  =  6.

Remark 1: If [formula] for some Λ-module M, then by Voigt's Lemma one gets that O(M) is open. The converse does not hold. The smallest example of this kind occurs for n = 9: Let M  =  M(xxyxyxyy) be in V(9,3,3). Then O(M) is open but [formula].

Remark 2: Let a  =  b  =  2 and n = 3. Then O(M(xy)) and O(M(yx)) are both open orbits, since M(xy) is projective and M(yx) is injective. In particular, Δ(2,1) and Δ((2,1),(2,1)) are both not irreducible.

Remark 3: The Gelfand-Ponomarev algebra Λ is a string algebra in the sense of [\cite=BR]. Similarly to Lemma [\ref=stringalgebrasaresubfinite] one can show that all string algebras are subfinite, and their index modules can be classified as in Lemma [\ref=indexmodules].

One should be able to classify the irreducible components of varieties of modules over many other string algebras in the same fashion as in this paper.
