Cycles over Fields of transcendence degree One

Introduction

We work over subfields k of [formula], the field of complex numbers. For a smooth variety V over k, the Chow group of cycles of codimension p is defined (see [\cite=Fulton]) as

[formula]

where the group of cycles Zp(V) is the free abelian group on scheme-theoretic points of V of codimension p and rational equivalence Rp(V) is the subgroup generated by cycles of the form [formula] where W is a subvariety of V of codimension (p - 1) and f is a non-zero rational function on it. There is a natural cycle class map

[formula]

where the latter denotes the singular cohomology group [formula] with the (mixed) Hodge structure given by Deligne (see [\cite=HodgeII]). The kernel of [formula] is denoted by [formula]. There is an Abel-Jacobi map (see [\cite=Griffiths]),

[formula]

where the latter is the intermediate Jacobian of a Hodge structure, defined as follows

[formula]

The kernel of Φp is denoted by [formula].

If V is a variety defined over a number field k then [formula].

We (of course) offer no proof of this conjecture. However, there are examples due to C. Schoen and M. V. Nori (see [\cite=Schoen]), which show that one cannot relax the conditions in this conjecture. In this paper we present these and other examples to show that [formula] is non-zero for V a variety over a field of transcendence degree at least one, whenever it is non-zero over some larger algebraically closed field.

We begin in Section 1 with a lemma. We then apply this lemma to prove the following result by Hodge-theoretic methods for the second Symmetric power of a curve. In Section 2 we generalise this to surfaces other than [formula]. To do this with we need to use an l-adic analogue of the Abel-Jacobi map. As before, let V be a smooth projective variety over k. Let R be a finitely generated subring of k for which there is a smooth projective morphism [formula], whose base change to k gives V. Let [formula] denote the kernel of the natural homomorphism

[formula]

We get a natural homomorphism

[formula]

Since any cycle (or rational equivalence) on V over k is defined over a finitely generated ring R, the direct limit of [formula] is [formula]. For want of better notation let us define

[formula]

i. e. [formula] is the corresponding direct limit of the [formula]'s. An l-adic analogue of the Abel-Jacobi map is the direct limit of the Φp,l,V's as we vary R,

[formula]

On the other hand, it is clear that we have natural homomorphisms

[formula]

One can show that these homomorphisms are injective when k is the field of fractions of the ring R by finding extensions of l-adic sheaves that represent elements of [formula]. The limiting homomorphism

[formula]

is thus another variant of the Abel-Jacobi homomorphism that has the same kernel as Φp,l, lim when k is a finitely generated field. We use the former map to define [formula]. Recent results of Nori (unpublished) show that the Hodge-theoretic definition of F2 gives a group that is not smaller than that given by the l-adic one above. It is still not clear that the two definitions coincide as has been conjectured by many (see [\cite=Jannsen]), and has been proved by Raskind [\cite=Wayne] for zero cycles by using the identification of the Intermediate Jacobian with the Albanese variety in this case.

The following theorem uses the l-adic version of the definition of F2. In the rest of the paper the two definitions of F2 will be used without a change of notation; it will be clear from the context which definition is being employed. By appealing to the result of Raskind [\cite=Wayne] the two definitions coincide in our case.

Let S be any surface with pg(S)  ≠  0 defined over a number field F. There are non-trivial cycles in [formula] where K is the algebraic closure of the function field F(T) in one variable T over F.

The Second Symmetric power of a Curve

For a surface S, let [formula] denote the orthogonal complement in H2(S) of the (Néron-Severi) subspace generated by cohomology classes of curves in S which are defined over an algebraically closed field.

Let C be a smooth projective curve and S be a smooth projective surface. Suppose Z is a homologically trivial cycle of codimension two in C  ×  S. Assume that C, S and Z are defined over a subfield k of [formula]. Suppose that either one of the following conditions hold:

The component in [formula] of the Abel-Jacobi invariant of Z is non-torsion. Or,

The component in [formula] of the l-adic Abel-Jacobi invariant Φ2,l, lim(Z) is non-torsion.

Then the following map is non-torsion on [formula],

[formula]

Let A denote the canonical divisor of C (which is defined over k). Let g denote the generic point of C considered as a point of [formula] and hence as a point of [formula] via some inclusion of k(C) in [formula]. If z( deg (A)g - A) is torsion in [formula], then a rational equivalence demonstrating this is defined over some finite extension of k(C). Taking the norm of this equivalence we see that z( deg (A)g - A) is torsion in [formula] as well. Hence a multiple of z( deg (A)g - A) is a sum of the form [formula] where [formula] is a curve and fi is a function on Di. Let Di  ⊂  C  ×  S be the Zariski closure of Di and consider the cycle W obtained by summing up [formula]. By assumption, W restricts to a multiple of z( deg (A)q - A) on [formula]. Thus there are closed points qj of C over k and divisors Ej in [formula] so that for some integer n we have

[formula]

The image of cycles of the form C  ×  z(A) as well as cycles of the form [formula] in the relevant piece of [formula] is zero in case (1) as well as (2). This contradicts the hypothesis on Z.

From this lemma it follows that in order to construct a non-trivial cycle in [formula] over a field of transcendence degree one it is sufficient to construct C, S and Z as above over a field of transcendence degree 0.

Let C be a smooth projective curve and S a smooth projective surface over a subfield F of [formula]. Let Z be a homologically trivial cycle on C  ×  S such that the induced homomorphism

[formula]

is non-torsion. Then, there is a non-torsion class in [formula].

From a result of Roitman [\cite=Roitman] it follows that the kernel of z is a countable union of translates of proper abelian subvarieties Ai of J(C). But each such translated abelian subvariety is defined over [formula] since Z is defined over [formula]. Using a point p of C over [formula] we embed C in J(C). Since the image of C generates J(C), the image of the generic point [formula] is not in Ai for any i. Its image under z gives us the desired cycle in [formula].

Let C be a curve of genus at least 2 over [formula]. Let [formula] and consider the cycle X in C  ×  C  ×  S which is the graph of the natural map [formula]. The map q* on [formula] identifies the range [formula] with the second exterior power of [formula]. The cohomology class

[formula]

The General Case

We use an argument of Terasoma (as explained to us by Bloch and Nori) to construct a triple (C,S,Z) as in Lemma [\ref=GG] for any surface S with pg  ≠  0.

Assume (,S̃,) is a triple over some finitely generated subfield k of [formula] which satisfies the condition (2) of Lemma [\ref=GG]. Then, there exists a specialisation (C,S,Z) over a number field [formula] which satisfies the condition (2) of Lemma [\ref=GG].

Let T be an affine variety over a number field contained in k and (C,S,Ξ) be a triple over S so chosen that this data restricts to (,S̃,) under the natural map [formula]. Using the Gysin sequence, we obtain an exact sequence of [formula] constructible local systems on T,

[formula]

here [formula] denotes the local system on T associated with the Galois representation [formula]. Moreover, the extension class of this short exact sequence is naturally identified with the component in [formula] of the class Φ2,l,C  ×  TS(Ξ). By assumption, condition (2) of Lemma [\ref=GG] means this component is non-zero. So the sequence is non-split.

If p is a closed point of T, let Cp, Sp, Zp denote the specialisations. By restricting the above sequence we obtain an exact sequence of representations of [formula] or equivalently, of a decomposition group of p in [formula],

[formula]

There are two possible problems.

There may be more divisors in Sp than on the generic fibre of S  →  T so that

[formula]

The above exact sequence may split so that the extension class becomes zero for Zp.

These two problems are resolved by applying the following lemma to the l-adic representation

[formula]

Let V be a continuous l-adic representation of the fundamental group of a variety T over a number field. Then there are infinitely many closed points p of T so that the image of [formula] in [formula] is the same as the image of the decomposition group of p.

Let G denote the image of [formula] in [formula] and Dp denote the image of a decomposition group associated with a closed point p of T. These are compact subgroups of [formula]. As in [\cite=Terasoma], there is a subgroup H of finite index in G so that Dp = G if and only if the natural map Dp  →  G / H is a surjection. Equivalently, if f:T'  →  T denotes the étale cover of T' corresponding to this finite quotient of the fundamental group of T, then it is enough that f- 1(p) is a closed point of T'. To find such a point p, we may shrink T to assume that T is affine and that there is an étale map [formula]. Thus it is enough to find a point q in [formula] so that [formula] is a closed point of T'. Such a point can be found by the Hilbert irreducibility theorem.

Now we consider a surface S over [formula] with pg(S)  ≠  0; let p be a closed point on S. Murre (see [\cite=Murre]) has constructed a decomposition of the diagonal of a surface S,

[formula]

for the diagonal ΔS in [formula]; where Xi,j is a cycle class so that its cohomology class has a non-zero Künneth component only in [formula]. Moreover, by the Hodge index theorem we can write [formula] where Ci and Di are curves on S and [formula] has its cohomology class in [formula].

Let [formula] be any pencil; Yi,j denote the cycles on H  ×  S that are the natural pull-backs of Xi,j for each i and j; similarly, let [formula] be the pull-back of [formula]. Let H0 denote the divisor class of the fibres of the pencil and A the class of an ample divisor on S. The class [formula] on H  ×  S, restricts to a homologically trivial class on every member Ht of the pencil; however, [formula] so that the cohomology class of [formula] in [formula] is non-zero.

For any open subset [formula], let [formula]; the map [formula] is injective. Thus the pull-back of [formula] to HU  ×  S is not homologically trivial for all U. By the Leray spectral sequence for the map π:HU  →  U, we see that [formula] maps injectively into [formula]. Let g denote the generic point of [formula]. The restriction of [formula] to Hg  ×  S is a cycle Zg such that the triple [formula] satisfies the condition (2) of Lemma [\ref=Specl] over the field k(g). Applying Lemma [\ref=Specl] we see that we have a point t in [formula] so that (Ht,S,Zt) is a triple satisfying condition 3 of the Lemma [\ref=GG] of Green and Griffiths. Thus we have proved Theorem [\ref=MainThm].
