Coexistence and Joint Measurability in Quantum Mechanics

Introduction: coexistent observables

The question on the possibility of measuring together two or more physical quantities lies at the hearth of quantum mechanics. Various notions and formulations have been employed to investigate this issue. Von Neumann's [\cite=vN32] analysis of simultaneous measurability of physical quantities in terms of commutativity of the self-adjoint operators representing those quantities is the starting point of much of the subsequent work. In particular, the investigations of Varadarajan [\cite=vsv62], Gudder [\cite=Gudder68], Hardegree [\cite=Hardegree77], Pulmannová [\cite=Pulmannova80], and Ylinen [\cite=Ylinen85] constitute an important line of research following von Nemann's approach.

The representation of observables as positive operator measures forces one to go beyond von Neumann's framework. Moreover, the simultaneity of the involved measurements, that is, the fact that the measurements are performed at the same time point, is, perhaps, not the most crucial aspect of this problem. Therefore, in that wider context, the notion of coexistence of observables has been chosen to describe the physical possibility of measuring together two or more quantities. This concept is due to Günther Ludwig [\cite=Ludwig64] and it was further elaborated e.g. in [\cite=Ludwig67], [\cite=Hellwig], [\cite=HNeumann], and [\cite=Kraus]. An extensive operational analysis of this notion is presented in [\cite=Ludwig83].

Let [formula] be a complex separable Hilbert space, [formula] the set of bounded operators on [formula], Ω a nonempty set, and A a sigma algebra of subsets of Ω. We call a positive normalized operator measure [formula] an observable and we refer to (Ω,A) as the value space of E.

Let E,E1, and E2 be any three observables with the value spaces (Ω,A), (Ω1,A1), and (Ω2,A2), and let [formula] = {E(X)  |  X∈A} denote the range of E.

Observables [formula] and [formula] are coexistent if there is an observable [formula] such that

[formula]

that is, for each X∈A1, and Y∈A2, E1(X) = E(ZX), and E2(Y) = E(ZY) for some ZX,ZY∈A.

The notion of coexistence of observables is a rather general notion and it seems to be open to characterizations only under further specifications. They will be studied next.

Functionally coexistent observables

Observables [formula] and [formula] are functions of an observable [formula], if there are (measurable) functions f1:Ω  →  Ω1 and f2:Ω  →  Ω2 such that for each X∈A1,Y∈A2,

[formula]

In that case we say that E1 and E2 are functionally coexistent.

As an immediate observation one has the following proposition:

Functionally coexistent observables are coexistent.

It is an open question whether coexistent observables are functionally coexistent. In what follows we shall investigate conditions under which coexistent observables are functionally coexistent and we shall work out some characterisations for functional coexistence. We start with another simple observation.

Two-valued observables E1 and E2 are coexistent if and only if they are functionally coexistent.

To demonstrate this fact, let {ω,ω'} and {ξ,ξ'} be two point value sets of the observables E1 and E2, with ran  (E1) = {O,A1,I - A1,I} and ran  (E2) = {O,A2,I - A2,I}, respectively, and let E be an observable such that E(X) = A1 and E(Y) = A2. Consider the partition [formula] of the value space Ω of E into disjoint A-sets, and let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], constitute a corresponding coarse-grained observable ER of E. The maps f1:1,3  ↦  ω;2,4  ↦  ω', and f2:1,2  ↦  ξ;3,4  ↦  ξ', allow one to write [formula] and [formula], showing that the two-valued observables are functionally coexistent.

Let (Ω1  ×  Ω2,A1  ×  A2) denote the product space of the measurable spaces (Ω1,A1) and (Ω2,A2), with A1  ×  A2  =  {(X,Y)  |  X∈A1,Y∈A2}.

A positive operator function [formula] is a positive operator bimeasure, if for each X∈A1,Y∈A2 the partial functions

[formula]

are positive operator measures. If B(Ω1,Ω2) = I we say that B is a biobservable. Observables [formula] and [formula] have a biobservable if there is a positive operator bimeasure [formula] such that for all X∈A1,Y∈A2,

[formula]

To combine observables into new observables, biobservables or joint observables, to be defined below, some continuity properties are needed. It would suffice to assume that Ω is a Hausdorff space, A  =  B(Ω) its Borel σ-algebra, and to require that the involde measures are Radon measures on B(Ω) [\cite=BCR84]. In physical applications the value spaces of observables are usually, if not always, equipped with locally compact metrisable and separable topologies. In [\cite=Ludwig83] some operational justification for that structure of a value space is also given. The measures on the Borel σ-algebras of such spaces are automatically Radon measures [\cite=Halmos]. In particular, this is the case for (Ω,B(Ω)) being the real or complex Borel spaces [formula], [formula], or their n-fold Cartesian products. To avoid the technical assumptions on Radon measures I assume from nowon that the value spaces of the observables are locally compact metrisable and separable topological spaces and, for short, I call them simply Borel spaces. Where this assumption is superfluous I go on to use the notation (Ω,A) to emphasize that no topological assumptions are needed.

Let (Ω1,B(Ω1)) and (Ω2,B(Ω2)) be two Borel spaces, and let B(Ω1  ×  Ω2) denote the Borel σ-algebra of Ω1  ×  Ω2.

Observables [formula] and [formula] have a joint observable if there is an observable [formula] such that for all [formula],

[formula]

Let (Ω1,B(Ω1)) and (Ω2,B(Ω2)) be two Borel spaces. For any two observables [formula] and [formula] the following three conditions are equivalent:

(i) E1 and E2 have a biobservable;

(ii) E1 and E2 have a joint observable;

(iii) E1 and E2 are functionally coexistent.

(i)   ⇒   (ii). Let B be a biobservable associated with E1 and E2. Then, for any [formula], the bimeasure [formula] determines a unique measure μ(B,φ) on [formula] such that for all X∈B(Ω1), Y∈B(Ω2),

[formula]

see Theorem 1.10, p. 24, of [\cite=BCR84]. Putting Fφ,φ(Z)  =  μ(B,φ)(Z) for all [formula], one defines through the polarization identity and the Frèchet-Riesz theorem an observable [formula] with the property

[formula]

[formula]

Regularly coexistent observables

In a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics the notion of regular effect is an important one: a nontrivial effect B is regular if its spectrum extends both below as well as above the value [formula]. For a further analysis of this notion the reader may consult [\cite=oqp]. Its relevance here follows from that fact that regular observables are characterized by their Boolean range.

An observable [formula] is called regular, if for any X∈A, such that O  ≠  E(X)  ≠  I,

[formula]

Clearly, an observable E is regular if and only if for any O  ≠  E(X)  ≠  I neither E(X)  ≤  E(X)' nor E(X)'  ≤  E(X).

Let [formula] be a regular observable. If [formula] is a summable sequence, that is, [formula] for each [formula], then [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is a Boolean algebra (with respect to the order and complement inhereted from the set of effects [formula]), and E is a Boolean σ-homomorphism [formula].

The proof follows that of [\cite=coex3]. Let [formula] be such that A1 + A2  ≤  I, and assume that A1 = E(X),A2 = E(Y). Then [formula], [formula]. Hence [formula], [formula]. Since A2  ≤  I - A1, it follows that [formula], so that by the regularity assumption, [formula]. Therefore A1 = E(X1) and A2 = E(Y1), where [formula], [formula] are disjoint sets. So we get [formula]. We note also that [formula] and [formula]. This observation will be used in the next paragraph.

Assume next that [formula] is a summable sequence in ran  (E). Using the above argument, we find disjoint sets X1,X2 such that A1 = E(X1), A2 = E(X2). Now we proceed by induction. Assume that we have already found disjoint sets [formula] such that Ai = E(Xi), [formula]. Then [formula]. By the summability assumption [formula]. Therefore, there is a set [formula] such that [formula], and An = E(Xn). Thus we find a sequence [formula] of disjoint sets such that Ai = E(Xi), [formula]. From the σ-additivity of E we obtain [formula], which shows that ran  (E) is closed under sums of summable sequences.

Let E(X),E(Y)∈ran  (E). We will prove that

[formula]

that is, E:A  →  ran (E) is a [formula]-morphism. Evidently, [formula]. Assume that for some Z∈A, E(Z)  ≤  E(X),E(Y). We can write [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

But we also have [formula], [formula], [formula], so that the effects [formula], [formula], and [formula] are irregular and thus equal O. Therefore also [formula]. Thus [formula]. This concludes the proof that [formula]. By de Morgan laws one gets the dual result: for any X,Y∈A, [formula]. Moreover, if the sets X and Y are disjoint, then [formula]. Also, if (Xi)  ⊂  A is a disjoint sequence, then

[formula]

To prove that ran  (E) is a Boolean algebra, it remains to prove distributivity. This follows immediately from the fact that E is a [formula]-morphism and a [formula]-morphism from a Boolean set.

The range ran  (E) of an observable E is a Boolean algebra (with the ordering inherited from [formula]) if and only if E is regular.

We have to prove the 'only if' part. Hence, assume that ran  (E) is Boolean, and let E(X) be an irregular element. Then E(X)  ≤  E(X)', which in a Boolean algebra implies that E(X) = O.

For any two observables [formula] and [formula], if there is a regular observable [formula] such that [formula], then E1 and E2 are functionally coexistent.

If E is regular, then from [formula] it follows that also E1 and E2 are regular. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=lemmaregular], all the ranges [formula] are Boolean. From this and from the fact that [formula] it then follows that the map [formula] is a biobservable of E1 and E2. Indeed, for a fixed Y∈B(Ω2), if (Xi)  ⊂  B(Ω1) is a disjoint sequence, then

[formula]

where (ZXi)  ⊂  B(Ω) is a disjoint sequence such that E(ZXi) = E1(Xi) (which exists since [formula] is summable). Similarly, one shows that for a fixed X∈B(Ω1), if (Yi)  ⊂  B(Ω2) is a disjoint sequence, then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=amalgamation] now assures that E1 and E2 are functionally coexistent.

In the context of the above theorem we say that observables E1 and E2 are regularly coexistent. We may then say that regularly coexistent observables are functionally coexistent.

Projection as a value of an observable

Projection valued observables are known to have very special properties. For the coexistence of two observables the fact that one of them is projection valued implies great simplifications. I start with quoting a well known result.

For any positive operator measure [formula], if E(X)2 = E(X) for some X∈A, then E(X)E(Y) = E(Y)E(X) for all Y∈A.

Assume that E(X)2 = E(X) for some X∈. For any Y∈, [formula], so that [formula], and [formula]. Therefore, the effects [formula] and [formula] are below the projections E(X) and I - E(X), respectively, so that

[formula]

Therefore, [formula], which gives through multiplication by E(X) that E(X)E(Y) = E(Y)E(X).

Assume that [formula] and [formula] are coexistent observables. If one of them is projection valued, then they are mutually commuting and hence functionally coexistent.

Assume that E1 is projection valued. Since E1 and E2 are coexistent, Lemma [\ref=commuting] implies that E1 and E2 are commuting: E1(X)E2(Y) = E2(Y)E1(X) for all X∈A1,Y∈A2. Thus the map [formula] determines a biobservable of E1 and E2, so that, by Theorem [\ref=amalgamation], observables E1 and E2 are functionally coexistent.

Commensurability

For projection valued observables the following notion of commensurability, or compatibility, is a further specification of the notion of coexistence. These notions were widely used in the so-called quantum logic approaches to quantum mechanics, see , for instance [\cite=V] [\cite=M] [\cite=BC].

Projection valued observables [formula] and [formula] are commensurable, if there is a projection valued observable [formula] such that [formula].

Any two projection valued observables [formula] and [formula] are coexistent if and only if they are commensurable.

Assume that E1 and E2 are coexistent projection valued observables. By Lemma [\ref=commuting] they are mutually commuting. Therefore, (X,Y)  ↦  E1(X)E2(Y) is a projection operator bimeasure, so that there is a joint projection valued observable [formula] such that E(X  ×  Ω2) = E1(X) and E(Ω1  ×  Y) = E2(Y). Thus E1 and E2 are commensurable. By definition, commensurable observables are coexistent.

Any two coexistent projection valued observables E1 and E2 are mutually commuting:

[formula]

The pioneering result of von Neumann [\cite=vN32] on commuting self-adjoint operators gives that any two mutually commuting projection valued observables are (Borel) functions of a third projection valued observable. We collect these results in the following corollary.

Let (Ω1,B(Ω1)) and (Ω2,B(Ω2)) be two Borel spaces. For any two projection valued observables [formula] and [formula] the following six conditions are equivalent:

(i)  E1 and E2 commute;

(ii)  E1 and E2 are commensurable;

(iii)  E1 and E2 are coexistent;

(iv) E1 and E2 are functionally coexistent;

(v)  E1 and E2 have a biobservable;

(vi)  E1 and E2 have a joint observable.

For projection valued observables E1 and E2 their commutativity, or coexistence, or any of the above equivalent formulations, has a natural generalisation to a partial commutativity, or partial coexistence. I shall review this question next, the basic results are due to [\cite=Hardegree77] [\cite=Pulmannova80] [\cite=Ylinen85].

For any two projection valued observables E1 and E2, their commutativity domain com  (E1,E2) consists of those vectors [formula] for which

[formula]

for all X∈A1,Y∈A2. We say that E1 and E2 are commutative if [formula] and totally noncommutative if com  (E1,E2) = {0}.

For any two projection valued observables E1 and E2 their commutativity domain com  (E1,E2) is a closed subspace of [formula] and it reduces E1 and E2, that is, for any X∈A1,Y∈A2,

[formula]

The first claim follows since com  (E1,E2) can be expressed as the intersection of closed subspaces,

[formula]

Let φ∈ com  (E1,E2). Then for any Z∈A1, E1(Z)φ∈ com  (E1,E2), since, for all X∈A1,Y∈A2,

[formula]

Similarly, one gets E2(Y)(com  (E1,E2))  ⊆  com  (E1,E2) for each Y∈A2.

Consider two projection valued observables E1 and E2 defined on the Borel spaces (Ω1,B(Ω1)) and (Ω2,B(Ω2)), respectively. For any unit vector [formula], the following conditions are equivalent:   (i)  φ∈ com  (E1,E2),

(ii)  there is a probability measure μ:B(Ω1  ×  Ω2)  →  [0,1] such that

[formula]

for all X∈B(Ω1),Y∈B(Ω2).

The restrictions [formula] and [formula] of E1 and E2 on com  (E1,E2) are mutually commuting spectral measures, so that, by Corollary [\ref=commensurability], the map [formula] extends to a joint projection valued observable [formula]. But then, for any φ∈ com  (E1,E2), and X∈B(Ω1),Y∈B(Ω2), [formula], which concludes the proof.

Sequential measurements

Let [formula] denote the set of trace class operators on [formula], and let [formula] denote its subset of positive trace one operators, the states of the quantum system associated with [formula]. Let [formula] denote the set of (trace norm) bounded linear operators on [formula], which is a complex Banach space with respect to the trace norm. Let (Ω,A) be a measurable space. A function [formula] is an instrument if for all [formula] the function

[formula]

is a probability measure. It follows that the function X  ↦  E(X), defined through

[formula]

is an observable [formula], the associate observable of I. It is another matter of fact that each observable E is the associate observable of some instruments I; such instruments are called E-compatible.

Consider any two instruments [formula] and [formula], and let E1 and E2 be their associate observables. For each [formula] the function

[formula]

is a probability bimeasure. By the duality [formula], the bimeasures μT, [formula], define a positive operator bimeasure [formula] such that

[formula]

for all [formula]. The partial positive operator measures EΩ1 and EΩ2, associated with Ω1 and Ω2, respectively, are easily seen to be the observables

[formula]

where we have used the dual transformation [formula] of the state transformation [formula]; for all [formula]

[formula]

We recall that using the dual transformer I*:X  ↦  I(X)*,X∈A2, the associate observable E of I can be expressed as E(X)  =  I(X)*(I), X∈A; see, for instance [\cite=Davies].

The above construction of biobservables shows that any two instruments I1 and I2, defined on the Borel spaces (Ω1,B(Ω1)) and (Ω2,B(Ω2)), respectively, give rise to a pair of observables for which any of the conditions of Theorem [\ref=amalgamation] is satisfied. These observables depend on the order in which the instruments are applied:

[formula]

In the first case these observables are those given in ([\ref=partialobservables1a]) and ([\ref=partialobservables1b]), in the second case they are given by

[formula]

Usually, the sequential biobservables B21 and B12 are different. However, it may happen that they are the same, that is, B12  =  B21. In such a case the observables E1 and E2 are, by Theorem [\ref=amalgamation], functionally coexistent.

Joint measurability

A measurement scheme for a quantum system associated with a Hilbert space [formula] is a 4-tuple M: =  〈〉 consisting of a (complex separable) Hilbert space [formula] (describing the measuring apparatus), a state W∈S( (the initial state of the apparatus), an observable P:A  →  L( (the pointer observable), and a state transformation [formula] (a positive trace preserving map which models the measurement coupling). A measurement scheme M determines an observable [formula] through the relation:

[formula]

This observable is the observable measured by the scheme M. It is a basic result of the quantum theory of measurement that for each observable [formula] there is a measurement scheme M such that E  =  EM. A measurement scheme M also determines a instrument IM:

[formula]

where [formula] is the partial trace over the apparatus Hilbert space [formula]. Clearly, EM is the associate observable of IM.

Consider now any two observables E1 and E2 (of the system with the Hilbert space [formula]). We say that E1 and E2 can be measured together if there is a measurement scheme M and two Borel functions (pointer functions) f1 and f2 such that

[formula]

It is an immediate observation that the observables E1 and E2 can be measured together in the above sense if and only if they are functionally coexistent.

Consider next any two measurement schemes M1 and M2. They can be applied sequentially, in either order: first M1 and then M2, or first M2 and then M1. This corresponds to the application of the instruments IM1 and IM2 one after the other, in either order. The resulting sequential biobservables B21 and B12 are obtained from Eqs ([\ref=partialobservables3a]) and ([\ref=partialobservables3b]). In general, the result of such a sequential measurement depends on the order in which the two measurements are performed. It may happen, however, that the measurements in question are commutative in the sense that their sequential application is order independet. The observables EM1 and EM2 determined by such measurement schemes are functionally coexistent. As is well known, it is highly exceptional that two measurement schemes M1 and M2 are commutative in this sense.
