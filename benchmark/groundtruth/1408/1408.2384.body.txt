Qualitative properties of multi-bubble solutions for nonlinear elliptic equations involving critical exponents

Introduction

In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis on the problem

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded domain contained in [formula] (n  ≥  3), p  =  (n + 2) / (n - 2), and ε > 0 is a small parameter. When ε  >  0, the compactness of the Sobolev embedding [formula] allows one to find its extremal function, hence a positive least energy solution ūε for [\eqref=eq-main-e]. However this does not hold anymore if ε  =  0 and in fact existence of solutions strongly depends on topological or geometric properties of the domain in this case (see for instance [\cite=BC] and [\cite=D]). If ε  =  0 and Ω is star-shaped, then the supremum of ūε should diverge to ∞   as ε  →  0 since an application of the Pohoaev identity [\cite=P] gives nonexistence of a nontrivial solution for [\eqref=eq-main-e]. In the work of Brezis and Peletier [\cite=BP], they deduced the precise asymptotic behavior of ūε when the domain Ω is the unit ball, and this result was extended to general domains by Han [\cite=H] and Rey [\cite=R], in which they independently proved that ūε blows-up at the unique point that is a critical point of the Robin function of the domain. Later, Grossi and Pacella [\cite=GP] investigated the related eigenvalue problem, obtaining estimates for its first (n + 2)-eigenvalues, asymptotic behavior of the corresponding eigenvectors and the Morse index of ūε.

Let {εk}∞k = 1 be a sequence of small positive numbers such that εk  →  0 as k  →    ∞   and {uεk}∞k = 1 a bounded sequence in H10(Ω) of solutions for [\eqref=eq-main-e] with ε  =  εk, which blow-up at [formula] points [formula]. Then by the work of Struwe [\cite=S] on the representation of Palais-Smale sequences for [\eqref=eq-main-e], which employed the concentration-compactness principle [\cite=Lio], it can be written as

[formula]

after extracting a subsequence if necessary. Here α0  =  1 / (n - 2), αik  →  1, λik  →  λi0  >  0 and xik  →  xi0 as k  →    ∞  , Uλ,x0 is the bubble with the concentration rate λ  >  0 and the center [formula]

[formula]

the function PUλ,x0 is a projected bubble in H10(Ω), namely, a solution of

[formula]

and Rk is a remainder term whose H10(Ω)-norm converges to 0 as k  →    ∞  . Moreover, according to Bahri, Li and Rey [\cite=BLR], if we denote by G  =  G(x,y) (x,y∈Ω) the Green's function of -  Δ with Dirichlet boundary condition satisfying

[formula]

by H(x,y) its regular part, i.e.,

[formula]

and by τ the Robin function τ(x)  =  H(x,x), then the blow-up rates and the concentration points [formula] can be characterized as a critical point of the function

[formula]

in general, provided that n  ≥  4. Here

[formula]

Conversely, by applying the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, Musso and Pistoia [\cite=MP] proved that if n  ≥  3 and [formula] is a C1-stable critical point of H in the sense of Y. Li [\cite=L], then there is a multi-bubbling solution of [\eqref=eq-main-e] having the form [\eqref=eq-asym] which blows-up at each point xi0 with the rate of the concentration λi0 ([formula]. This extends the existence result also achieved in paper [\cite=BLR], where the authors used the gradient flow of critical points at infinity to get solutions.

Our interest lies on the derivation of certain asymptotic behaviors of solutions {uε}ε to [\eqref=eq-main-e] satisfying [\eqref=eq-asym] when ε converges to 0. (Precisely speaking, sequences of parameters εk, αik, λik and xik in [\eqref=eq-asym] should be substituted by ε, αiε, λiε and xiε, respectively, such that αiε  →  1, λiε  →  λi0 and xiε  →  xi0 as ε  →  0. Hereafter, such a substitution is always assumed.) It will be done by examining the associated eigenvalue problem

[formula]

We let [formula] be the [formula]-th eigenvalue of [\eqref=eq-lin] provided that the sequence of eigenvalues is arranged in nondecreasing order permitting duplication, and [formula] the corresponding L∞(Ω)-normalized eigenfunction (namely, [formula]).

The main aim of this paper is to provide a detailed description on the asymptotic behavior of [formula] for [formula].

Firstly, we concentrate on behavior of the first m-eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Given [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, let [formula] be a dilation of [formula] defined as

[formula]

Let ε  >  0 be a small parameter, {uε}ε a family of solutions for [\eqref=eq-main-e] of the form [\eqref=eq-asym], [formula] the [formula]-th eigenvalue of problem [\eqref=eq-lin] for some [formula]. Denote also as [formula] the [formula]-th eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix [formula] given by

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

as ε  →  0. Moreover, there exists a nonzero column vector

[formula]

such that for each [formula] the function [formula] converges to [formula] weakly in [formula]. This [formula] becomes an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue [formula] of A1, and it holds that [formula] for [formula].

Next, we study the next mn-eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. The first theorem for these eigenpairs concerns with asymptotic behaviors of the eigenvectors. Let us define a symmetric m  ×  m matrix [formula] by

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem-pos] below, it can be checked that M1 is positive definite and in particular invertible. We denote its inverse by [formula].

Assume that [formula]. Then, for each [formula], there exists a vector [formula], which is nonzero for some i, such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

in [formula] as ε  →  0. Here [formula].

If [formula] denotes a nonzero vector defined by

[formula]

then we can give a further description on it. Our next theorem is devoted to this fact as well as a quite precise estimate of the eigenvalues. Set an m  ×  mn matrix P  =  (Pit)1  ≤  i  ≤  m,1  ≤  t  ≤  mn and a symmetric mn  ×  mn matrix Q  =  (Qst)1  ≤  s,t  ≤  mn as follows.

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula], and

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula].

Let A2 be an mn  ×  mn symmetric matrix

[formula]

Then as ε  →  0 we have

[formula]

for some c0  >  0 (whose value is computed in [\eqref=eq-eigen-cha-0]) where [formula] is the [formula]-th eigenvalue of the matrix A2. Furthermore the vector [formula] is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue [formula] of A2, which satisfies [formula] for [formula].

If the number of blow-up points is m  =  1, then P  =  0 and so the matrix A2 is reduced to [formula], the Hessian of the Robin function up to a constant multiple, which is consistent with the result of [\cite=GP]. Note that our Robin function has the opposite sign of that in [\cite=GP], so the sign of the coefficient for [formula] in [\eqref=eq-eigenv-first] is negative in our case. See also Remark [\ref=rem-est-k_1i].

Lastly, the [formula]-th eigenpair for [formula] can be examined. Let [formula] be a symmetric matrix whose components are given by

[formula]

For each [formula], let [formula] be the [formula]-th eigenvalue of A3ij, which will be shown be positive. Then there exist a nonzero vector

[formula]

and a positive number c1 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Furthermore, [formula] is a corresponding eigenvector to [formula], and it holds that [formula] for [formula].

As a result, we obtain the following corollary.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the morse index and the augmented Morse index of the solution uε to [\eqref=eq-main-e], respectively. Also for the matrix A2 in Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-first-2], [formula] and [formula] are similarly understood. Then

[formula]

for sufficiently small ε  >  0. Therefore if A2 is nondegenerate, then so is uε and

[formula]

By the discussion before, our results hold for solutions found by Musso and Pistoia in [\cite=MP]. Moreover, if εk  →  0 as k  →    ∞  , any H10(Ω)-bounded sequence {uεk}∞k = 1 of solutions for [\eqref=eq-main-e] with ε  =  εk has a subsequence to which our work can be applied.

This extends the work of Bahri-Li-Rey [\cite=BLR] where the validity of the above corollary was obtained for n  ≥  4. Besides Theorems [\ref=thm-eigen-zero], [\ref=thm-eigen-first], [\ref=thm-eigen-first-2] and [\ref=thm-eigen-second] provide sharp asymptotic behaviors of the eigenpairs [formula] as ε  →  0 which were not dealt with in [\cite=BLR]. In this article we compute each component of the matrix A2 explicitly, which turns out to be complicated. Instead doing in this way, the authors of [\cite=BLR] gave an alternative neat description.

Our proof is based on the work of Grossi and Pacella [\cite=GP] which studied qualitative behaviors of single blow-up solutions of [\eqref=eq-main-e], but requires a further inspection on the interaction between different bubbles here. In particular we have to control the decay of solutions uε and eigenfunctions [formula] near each blow-up point in a careful way. In order to get the sharp decay of uε, we will utilize the method of moving spheres which has been used on equations from conformal geometry and related areas. (See for example [\cite=CL] [\cite=CC] [\cite=LZh] [\cite=Pa].) Furthermore we shall make use of the Moser-Harnack type estimate and an iterative comparison argument to find an almost sharp decay of [formula].

Before starting the proof of our main theorems, we would like to mention about related results obtained for the Gelfand problem

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded smooth domain in [formula] and λ  >  0 is a small parameter. In [\cite=GG], given uλ an one-bubble solution satisfying [formula] as λ  →  0, Gladiali and Grossi obtained the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues μ for the problem

[formula]

and the Morse index of uλ as a by-product. Recently, such a type of results has been generalized to solutions with multiple blow-up points in [\cite=GGOS], and further qualitative properties of the first m eigenfunctions has been described in [\cite=GGO] when m designates the number of blow-up points.

Also, we believe that there should be analogue to our main results for solutions of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem [\cite=BN]

[formula]

where Ω is a bounded smooth domain of [formula] (n  ≥  5), if asymptotic forms of the solutions are written as

[formula]

for λiε  →  λi0  >  0, xiε  →  xi0 and [formula] in H10(Ω) as ε  →  0. This type of solutions was obtained by Musso and Pistoia [\cite=MP], while Takahashi [\cite=T] analyzed the linear problem of one-bubble solutions.

The structure of this paper can be described in the following way. In Section [\ref=sec-pre], we gather all preliminary results necessary to deduce our main theorems. This section in particular includes estimates of the decay of the solutions uε or the eigenfunctions [formula] outside of the concentration points [formula]. In Section [\ref=sec-3], we prove Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero] which deals with the first m-eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of problem [\eqref=eq-lin]. A priori bounds for the first (n + 1)m-eigenvalues and the limit behavior [\eqref=eq-eigenf-first-1] of expanded eigenfunction [formula] are found in Section [\ref=sec-4]. Based on these results, we compute an asymptotic expansion [\eqref=eq-eigenf-first-2] of the [formula]-th eigenvectors ([formula]) and that of its corresponding eigenvalues [\eqref=eq-eigenv-first] in Sections [\ref=sec-5] and [\ref=sec-6] respectively. The description of the vector [formula] is also obtained as a byproduct during the derivation of [\eqref=eq-eigenv-first]. Section [\ref=sec-7] is devoted to study the next m-eigenpairs, i.e., the [formula]-th eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ([formula]). Finally, we present the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] in Appendix [\ref=sec-mov-sphere], which is conducted with the moving sphere method.

Preliminaries

In this section, we collect some results necessary for our analysis. For the rest of the paper, we write [formula] to denote the concentration points, dropping out the subscript 0. The same omission also applies to the concentrate rates [formula].

If we set a matrix [formula] by

[formula]

then it is a non-negative definite matrix.

See Appendix A of Bahri, Li and Rey [\cite=BLR].

Fix any [formula] and decompose uε in the following way.

[formula]

Then we rescale it to define

[formula]

It immediately follows that {ũiε}ε is a family of positive C2-functions defined in [formula] for some r0  >  0 small enough (determined in the next lemma), which are solutions of -  Δu  =  up - ε. Moreover it has the following property.

The sequence {ũiε}ε satisfies [formula] for some small r0  >  0 and converges to U1,0 weakly in [formula] as ε  →  0.

For fixed i, let us denote [formula] for [formula]. Set also Uj  =  Uλjεεα0,xjε for all [formula]. Then [formula] and

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq-u-exp-2]. Observe that 0  ≤  PUi  ≤  Ui in Ω and

[formula]

holds for any small λ  >  0 and x0∈Ω away from the boundary. Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

so that the last three terms in the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq-u-dil] go to 0 strongly in [formula]. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

as ε  →  0 for any test function [formula]. Therefore [formula] weakly in [formula].

We now attempt to attain a priori L∞-estimate for {ũiε}ε. Firstly we fix a sufficiently small r0. In fact, [formula] would suffice. Then for any number η  >  0, one can find r  >  0 small such that [formula] is valid for any |x|  ≤  ε-  α0r0 provided ε  >  0 sufficiently small. Hence the Moser iteration technique applies as in [\cite=H], deducing

[formula]

where the rightmost value is uniformly bounded in ε  >  0. Also it is notable that C  >  0 is independent of x, r or ũiε. As a result, we observe from the elliptic regularity [\cite=H] that

[formula]

where C  >  0 depends only on r and the supreme of [formula]. This completes the proof.

This lemma will be used in a crucial way to deduce a local uniform estimate near each blow-up point [formula] of uε.

There exist numbers C > 0 and small δ0∈(0,r0) independent of ε  >  0 such that

[formula]

for all sufficiently small ε  >  0.

A closely related result to Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] appeared in [\cite=LZ] as an intermediate step to deduce the compactness property of the Yamabe equation, the problem proposed by Schoen who also gave the positive answer for conformally flat manifolds (see [\cite=Sch]). Even though the proof of this proposition, based on the moving sphere method, can be achieved by adapting the argument presented in [\cite=LZ] with a minor modification, we provide it in Appendix [\ref=sec-mov-sphere] to promote clear understanding of the reader.

From the next lemma to Lemma [\ref=lem-u-asym], we study the behavior of solutions uε of [\eqref=eq-main-e] outside the blow-up points [formula]. For the sake of notational convenience, we set

[formula]

Suppose that {uε}ε is a family of solutions for [\eqref=eq-main-e] satisfying the asymptotic behavior [\eqref=eq-asym]. Then for any r  >  0, we have uε(x)  =  o(1) uniformly for x∈Ar.

Let aε  =  up - 1 - εε so that -  Δuε  =  aεuε in Ω. Then we see from [\eqref=eq-asym] that

[formula]

Therefore we can proceed the Morse iteration argument as in the proof of [\cite=H] to get [formula] for some q  >  n / 2, and then the standard elliptic regularity result (see [\cite=H]) implies [formula].

We can improve this result by combining the kernel expression of uε and Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ].

Fix r  >  0 small. Then there holds

[formula]

uniformly for x∈Ar.

Without any loss of generality, we may assume that r∈(0,δ0) where δ0  >  0 is the number picked up in Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] so that [\eqref=eq-LZ] holds. Thus if we fix [formula], then we have the bound

[formula]

valid for each x such that r / 2  ≤  |x  -  xi|  ≤  r. It says that [formula] for all [formula].

By Green's representation formula, one may write

[formula]

Let us estimate each of the term in the right-hand side. If we set bε  =   max {uε(x):x∈Ar}, then we find

[formula]

for any x∈Ar. Besides, [\eqref=eq-LZ] gives us that

[formula]

for each i and x∈Ar, where C(r)  =   max {G(x,y):x,y∈Ω,|x - y|  ≥  r / 2}. Hence, by combining [\eqref=eq-bound-1] and [\eqref=eq-bound-2], we get

[formula]

Since it is guaranteed by Lemma [\ref=lem-u-zero] that bε  =  o(1), this shows that [formula]. The lemma is proved.

The following result will be used to obtain the asymptotic formulas of the eigenvalues.

Suppose that uε satisfies equation [\eqref=eq-main-e] and the asymptotic behavior [\eqref=eq-asym]. Then we have

[formula]

in [formula]. Here [formula].

Take any r  >  0 small for which Lemma [\ref=lem-u-bound] holds and decompose uε(x) as in [\eqref=eq-u-decom] for x∈Ar. Then we have

[formula]

Also, if we write

[formula]

for [formula], it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem-u-dil] and the dominated convergence theorem that

[formula]

and from the mean value theorem that

[formula]

Therefore, combining [\eqref=eq-u-decom], [\eqref=eq-2-2], [\eqref=eq-2-3] and [\eqref=eq-2-4], we confirm that

[formula]

Since r > 0 is arbitrary, [\eqref=eq-u-ep-asym] holds in [formula]. Also, the C2-convergence comes from the elliptic regularity. This proves the lemma.

In Lemma [\ref=lem-con-ext] and Lemma [\ref=lem-w-bound], we conduct a decay estimate for solutions of the eigenvalue problem [\eqref=eq-lin].

For a fixed [formula], let [formula] be the family of [formula]-th eigenvalues for problem [\eqref=eq-lin], and [formula] an L∞(Ω)-normalized eigenfunction corresponding to [formula]. Then for any r > 0 the function [formula] converges to zero uniformly in Ar as ε  →  0.

For x∈Ar, we write

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem-u-bound], we have

[formula]

Also, we utilize [\eqref=eq-LZ] to obtain that

[formula]

for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  m where the definition of C(r) can be found in the sentence after [\eqref=eq-bound-2]. Putting estimates [\eqref=eq-5-2] and [\eqref=eq-5-3] into [\eqref=eq-5-1] validates that [formula] uniformly in Ar.

Assume that 0∈Ω, fix [formula] and set

[formula]

Then for any ζ  >  0 small, we can pick a constant C  =  C(ζ)  >  0 independent of ε  >  0 such that

[formula]

In particular, if [formula] are given and [formula] is a family of dilated eigenfunctions for [\eqref=eq-main-e] defined as in [\eqref=eq-v-exp], then

[formula]

and vε  =  O(ε) in Ar for some r  >  0 small.

One can derive the decay estimate [\eqref=eq-w-bound-0] by adapting the proof of Lemmas A.5, B.3 and Proposition B.1 of Cao, Peng and Yan [\cite=CPY] in a suitable way, in which the authors investigated the p-Laplacian version of the Brezis-Nirenberg problem. We sketch it for the completeness. Let [formula] and iε  =  ε-  α0xiε.

Notice that [formula] solves

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] and Lemma [\ref=lem-u-bound], we realize that [formula] holds in each annulus [formula] provided [formula] and R  >  1 large, and [formula] in [formula]. Hence, given any η  >  0, there exists a large R(η)  >  1 such that

[formula]

Suppose that ζ  >  0 is selected to be small enough. Then one can apply the Moser iteration technique to get a small number η  >  0 and large q  >  p + 1 such that if [\eqref=eq-w-bound-1] holds, there is a constant C  >  0 independent of R, η or [formula] satisfying

[formula]

for any R  >  2R(η). On the other hand, it is possible to get that [formula] by taking a smaller ζ if necessary. Thus standard elliptic regularity theory gives

[formula]

for all [formula], R  ≥  3R(η).

Having [\eqref=eq-w-bound-2] in mind, we now prove [\eqref=eq-w-bound-0] by employing the comparison principle iteratively. Assume that it holds

[formula]

some Dj  >  0 and 0  <  qj  <  n - 2 to be determined soon ([formula]). Since we have (n - 2)(p - 1 - ε)  >  3 for small ε  >  0, Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ], Lemma [\ref=lem-u-bound] and [\eqref=eq-max-0] tell us that there exists some [formula] whose choice is affected by only Dj, n and [formula] such that

[formula]

Select any number 0  <    <   min (1,n - 2 - qj) and set a function

[formula]

where Dj + 1  >  0 is a number so large that [formula] on [formula]. Then one can compute

[formula]

by taking a larger Dj + 1 if necessary. However χj  >  0 and [formula] on ∂Ωε, whence [formula] on [formula]. Consequently, by [\eqref=eq-max-1] and the maximum principle, it follows that

[formula]

Letting [formula] in [\eqref=eq-w-bound-2], choosing an appropriate D1 > 0 and repeating this comparison procedure, we can deduce

[formula]

given any 1  <  q  <  n - 2. This proves [\eqref=eq-w-bound-0].

Finally, [\eqref=eq-w-bound-3] and the claim that vε  =  O(ε) in Ar is a straightforward consequence of [\eqref=eq-w-bound-0]. The proof is completed.

By utilizing [\eqref=eq-LZ], [\eqref=eq-w-bound-3], [\eqref=eq-u-bound], the fact that vε  =  O(ε) in Ar and regularity theory, we immediately establish a decay estimate for the derivatives of ũiε and [formula].

For any [formula], there exists a universal constant C  >  0 such that

[formula]

for ζ, r  >  0 small. Moreover we have

[formula]

as ε  →  0 in any compact subset of Ar.

Finally, we recall two well-known results. The first lemma states the nondegeneracy property of the standard bubble U1,0. We refer to [\cite=BE] for its proof.

The space of solutions to the linear problem

[formula]

is spanned by

[formula]

The next lemma lists some formulas regarding the derivatives of Green's function. The proof can be found in [\cite=GP] [\cite=H].

For x0∈Ω, it holds that

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here ν is the outward normal unit vector to ∂Ω and dS is the surface measure ∂Ω.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero]

In this section, we present estimates for the first m eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of [\eqref=eq-lin].

For the set of the concentration points [formula], let us fix a small number r  >  0 such that for any 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  m and any ε  >  0 small the following holds:

[formula]

For each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, we set φi(x) = φ(x  -  xi) where a cut-off function φ∈C∞c(Bn(0,3r)) satisfies [formula] in Bn(0,2r) and 0  ≤  φ  ≤  1 in Bn(0,3r). Define also

[formula]

in Ω.

The following lemma serves as a main ingredient for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero]

Fix [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is a family of normalized eigenfunctions of [\eqref=eq-lin] corresponding to the [formula]-th eigenvalue [formula]. Then there exists at least one [formula] such that [formula] (see [\eqref=eq-v-exp] for its definition) converges to a nonzero function in the weak [formula]-sense.

Lemma [\ref=lem-w-bound] ensures that there exist a large R  >  0 and a small r  >  0 such that [formula] for R  ≤  |x|  ≤  ε-  α0r. Suppose that [formula] weakly in [formula] as ε  →  0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Then each [formula] tends to 0 uniformly in Bn(0,R) by elliptic regularity. Since we already know that vε  →  0 uniformly on Ar from Lemma [\ref=lem-con-ext], it follows that [formula]. However [formula] by its own definition, hence a contradiction arises.

Given Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-nonzero], we are now ready to start to prove Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero].

Let V be a vector space whose basis consists of {uε,i:1  ≤  i  ≤  m}. By the Courant-Fischer-Weyl min-max principle, we have

[formula]

With this characterization in hand, it is easy to derive that μmε  ≤  p- 1  +  o(1). Thus, if we let [formula], we know that [formula] for any [formula].

Fix [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-nonzero] there is an index [formula] such that [formula] converges [formula]-weakly to a nonzero function V. A direct computation shows

[formula]

where the function ũiε and the set Ωi0ε are defined in [\eqref=eq-u-exp] and [\eqref=eq-v-exp], respectively. Thus it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem-u-dil] that [formula] is a solution of

[formula]

Consequently, the estimate for [formula] in the previous paragraph implies that [formula].

On the other hand, for any i, we also see that [formula] converges to a function W weakly in [formula] so that W solves -  ΔW  =  Up - 11,0W in [formula]. Thus there is a nonzero vector [formula] such that [formula] weakly in [formula] for each [formula].

Let us prove [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-0] now. Fixing i, we multiply [\eqref=eq-main-e] (or [\eqref=eq-lin] with [formula]) by [formula] (or uε) to get the identity, say, I (or II respectively). Also we denote by [formula] and [formula] the identities which can be obtained after integrating I and II over Bn(xiε,r). Subtracting [formula] from [formula] and utilizing Green's identity [\eqref=eq-green-id] below, we see then

[formula]

for each [formula] and any r  >  0 sufficiently small. Moreover, if we set the functions

[formula]

which are harmonic near xi, then (the proof of) Lemma [\ref=lem-u-asym] permits us to obtain that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for x∈Bn(xiε,2r). Therefore, by inserting [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-2] and [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-3] into [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-1], and using the mean value formula for harmonic functions and [formula] then, one discovers

[formula]

and

[formula]

(refer to [\eqref=eq-upsilon-2]). From this, we get

[formula]

or equivalently, [formula]. This justifies [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-0]. We also showed that [formula] is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue [formula] at the same time.

Finally, to verify the last assertion of the theorem, we assume that [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal each other, we have

[formula]

Thus [formula]. Here the last equality can be justified by the dominated convergence theorem with Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] and Lemma [\ref=lem-w-bound].

Upper bounds for the [formula]-th eigenvalues and asymptotic behavior of the [formula]-th eigenfunctions, [formula]

The objective of this section is to provide estimates of the [formula]-th eigenvalues and its corresponding eigenfunctions when [formula]. Their refinement will be accomplished in the subsequent sections based on the results deduced in this section.

In the first half of this section, our interest will lie on achieving upper bounds of the eigenvalues [formula] for [formula], as the following proposition depicts.

Suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

We define a linear space V spanned by

[formula]

(refer to [\eqref=eq-u-psi]). By the variational characterization of the eigenvalue [formula], we have

[formula]

Any nonzero function [formula] can be written as

[formula]

for some nonzero numbers aik (1  ≤  i  ≤  m and 0  ≤  k  ≤  n). As fi1 and fi2 have disjoint supports if 1  ≤  i1  ≠  i2  ≤  m,

[formula]

Hence it suffices to show that each [formula] is bounded by [formula]. As a matter of fact, this can be achieved along the line of the proof of [\cite=GP], but we provide a brief sketch here since our argument slightly simplifies the known proof.

Fix [formula]. For the sake of notational simplicity, we write [formula], φ  =  φi and ak  =  aik for 0  ≤  k  ≤  n. Denote also [formula] so that fi  =  a0φuε  +  φzε. After multiplying [\eqref=eq-main-e] by φ2uε or φ2zε, and integrating the both sides over Ω, one can deduce

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly, testing -  Δzε  =  (p - ε)up - 1 - εεzε with φ2zε, one finds that

[formula]

Then [\eqref=eq-apriori-1]-[\eqref=eq-apriori-3] yields [formula] where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Our aim is to find an upper bound of [formula] and a lower bound of [formula]. Let us estimate [formula] first. We see at once that

[formula]

Also, if we let [formula], then [\eqref=eq-u-bound] guarantees

[formula]

Moreover we have that

[formula]

On the other hand, for [formula] and [formula], we easily discover

[formula]

and

[formula]

(cf. [\eqref=eq-apriori-1] and [\eqref=eq-apriori-3]), which implies

[formula]

Utilizing these estimates and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we deduce

[formula]

To obtain a lower bound of [formula], we note that

[formula]

and that Lemma [\ref=lem-u-d-bound] ensures

[formula]

for 1  ≤  k, l  ≤  n. Hence we conclude that

[formula]

Consequently, a combination of [\eqref=eq-apriori-4] and [\eqref=eq-apriori-5] asserts that [formula]. This completes the proof of the lemma.

For [formula], we have the following limit

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-nonzero] we can find [formula] such that [formula] converges weakly to a nonzero function V. Then, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero], we observe that V solves

[formula]

where [formula]. Also, owing to Proposition [\ref=prop-apriori], we have [formula]. Since the morse index of U1,0 is 1, it should hold that [formula] or 1.

Assume that [formula]. Then the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero] again gives us that there is a vector [formula] such that [formula] weakly in [formula]. Furthermore [formula] for any [formula], but this is impossible since [formula] already spans [formula]. Hence [formula], which finishes the proof.

Next, we provide a general convergence result of the [formula]-th L∞(Ω)-normalized eigenfunction [formula]. We recall its dilation [formula] defined in [\eqref=eq-v-exp].

Suppose that [formula].

For any [formula] there exists a vector [formula] such that the function [formula] converges to

[formula]

weakly in [formula] (see [\eqref=eq-U] for the definition of Uλ,x0). In addition, there is at least one [formula] such that [formula].

As ε  →  0 we have

[formula]

where [formula].

It is not hard to show the first statement with Lemmas [\ref=lem-weak-nonzero] and [\ref=lem-nondeg], and Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori]. Hence let us consider the second statement. For r  >  0 fixed small, assume that a point x∈Ω belongs to Ar where Ar is the set in [\eqref=eq-A_r]. According to Green's representation formula and Lemmas [\ref=lem-u-bound] and [\ref=lem-con-ext],

[formula]

Besides, Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] with Lemmas [\ref=lem-w-bound] and [\ref=lem-weak-conv] (1) allow us to obtain

[formula]

Thus the lemma is proved.

In fact, we can refine the first statement of the above lemma to arrive at [\eqref=eq-eigenf-first-1], which is the main result of the latter part of this section.

Let [formula]. For each [formula] and [formula], the function [formula] converges to

[formula]

weakly in [formula].

As a preparation for its proof, we first consider the following auxiliary lemma.

Fix 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. For any small r  >  0 and 1  ≤  j,l  ≤  m, we define

[formula]

Then Irjl is independent of r  >  0 and its value is computed as

[formula]

Assuming 0  <  r2  <  r1 are small enough and putting [formula], g(x)  =  G(x,xl) and [formula] into Green's identity

[formula]

we see that Irjl is constant because

[formula]

for all x  ≠  xj, xl. Thus it suffices to find the value Ijl  =   lim r  →  0Irjl.

(1) If j, l  ≠  i, then Ijl  =  0. This follows simply by applying [\eqref=eq-green-id] for D  =  Bn(xi,r) since [\eqref=eq-green-zero] holds for any x∈Bn(xi,r).

(2) If j  ≠  i and l  =  i, then we have

[formula]

(3) Suppose that j  =  i and l  ≠  i. In this case, we deduce

[formula]

(4) If k = l = j, then the Green's identity, the fact that G(x,xi)  =  0 on ∂Ω and Lemma [\ref=lem-Green] lead

[formula]

All the computations made in (1)-(4) show the validity of [\eqref=eq-ijl].

Fix [formula] and let

[formula]

a solution of

[formula]

Then by [\eqref=eq-green-id] it satisfies

[formula]

for r  >  0 small, where ν is the outward normal unit vector to the sphere ∂Bn(xi,r).

In light of Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-conv] (1), we only need to verify that [formula] for all [formula]. Assume to the contrary that [formula] for some i. We will achieve a contradiction by showing that an estimate of μlε - 1 obtained through [\eqref=eq-w-v] does not match to one found in Proposition [\ref=prop-apriori]. To reduce the notational complexity, we use di or [formula] to denote [formula] in this proof.

Let us observe from Lemma [\ref=lem-u-asym] and [\eqref=eq-w_e] that

[formula]

as ε  →  0. Combining this with [\eqref=eq-v-conv] we get

[formula]

where Irjl is the value defined in [\eqref=eq-r]. By inserting [\eqref=eq-ijl] into the above identity, we further find that

[formula]

Here C0  =  c2 / ((n - 2)c1)  >  0 as in [\eqref=eq-mtx-M_0], and we employed the fact that [formula] is a critical point of the functional Υm (see [\eqref=eq-upsilon]) so as to obtain the second equality. Borrowing the notation of the matrix A3 in [\eqref=eq-mtx-A_3], the left-hand side of [\eqref=eq-w-v] can be described in a legible way.

[formula]

On the other hand, counting on Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] and Lemmas [\ref=lem-u-dil] and [\ref=lem-weak-conv], we can compute its right-hand side as follows.

[formula]

where [formula]. Consequently, [\eqref=eq-weak-conv-1], [\eqref=eq-weak-conv-2] and [\eqref=eq-w-v] enable us to deduce that

[formula]

Multiplying a row vector [formula] in the both sides yields

[formula]

where [formula] and M2 is the matrix introduced in Lemma [\ref=lem-pos]. However the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq-weak-conv-3] is positive due to Lemma [\ref=lem-pos], and this contradicts the bound of [formula] provided in Proposition [\ref=prop-apriori]. Hence it should hold that [formula] for all i. The proof is finished.

This result improves our knowledge on the limit behavior of the [formula]-th eigenvalues (see Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori]) for [formula], which is essential in the next section.

For [formula], one has

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop-weak-conv] and Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-conv] (1), there is [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula]. Without any loss of generality, we may assume that [formula]. By differentiating the both sides of [\eqref=eq-main-e], we get

[formula]

Let us multiply [\eqref=eq-apriori-a] by [formula] and [\eqref=eq-lin] by [formula], respectively, integrate both of them over Bn(xi1ε,r) for a small fixed r  >  0 and subtract the first equation from the second to derive

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem-u-d-bound], its left-hand side is [formula] while the right-hand side is computed as

[formula]

Therefore, if we denote [formula], we deduce that

[formula]

which leads the desired estimate [\eqref=eq-apriori-b].

A further analysis on asymptotic behavior of the [formula]-th eigenfunctions, [formula]

In view of Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-conv] and the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-weak-conv], we know that [formula] as ε  →  0 uniformly in Ω outside of the blow-up points [formula]. Motivated by the argument in [\cite=GGOS], we prove its improvement [\eqref=eq-eigenf-first-2] here, which is stated once more in the following proposition.

Let M1 and P be the matrices defined in [\eqref=eq-mtx-M_1] and [\eqref=eq-mtx-P], respectively. Also we remind a column vector [formula] in [\eqref=eq-eigenv-first-2] and set two row vectors G(x) and [formula] by

[formula]

for any x∈Ω. If [formula], then

[formula]

in [formula] as ε  →  0 where C1  >  0 is a constant in Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-first].

If we write [\eqref=eq-opt-conv] in terms of the components of the vectors G(x) and [formula], and matrices M- 11 and P, we get [\eqref=eq-eigenf-first-2].

We will present the proof by dividing it into several lemmas. The first lemma is a variant of Lemmas [\ref=lem-u-asym] and [\ref=lem-weak-conv] (2).

Given a small fixed number r  >  0, it holds that

[formula]

in [formula] as ε  →  0 where

[formula]

and [formula] is a row vector such that

[formula]

(note that κi0, κi1 and [formula] depend also on ε or [formula]).

The proof is similar to Lemmas [\ref=lem-u-asym] and [\ref=lem-weak-conv] (2), so we just briefly sketch why [\eqref=eq-v-conv-2] holds in C0(K) for any compact subset K of [formula]. For x∈Ar (see [\eqref=eq-A_r]), a combination of Green's representation formula and the Taylor expansion of G(x,y) in the y-variable show that

[formula]

Also, by means of Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] and Lemma [\ref=lem-w-bound], we have

[formula]

for each i, from which the desired result follows. The order of ki0,ki1 and [formula] can be computed as in [\eqref=eq-2-3] or [\eqref=eq-weak-conv-a].

Let us write uε and [formula] in the following way. For each [formula],

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that giε an hiε are harmonic in a neighborhood of xiε. With these decompositions we now compute κi1, will be shown to be [formula], by applying the bilinear version of the Pohoaev identity which the next lemma describes.

For any point [formula], a positive number r  >  0 and functions [formula], it holds that

[formula]

where ν is the outward unit normal vector on ∂Bn(x0,r).

This follows from an elementary computation. See the proof of [\cite=Ot] in which the author considered it when n  =  2.

Recall the definition of M1 in [\eqref=eq-mtx-M_1] and its inverse [formula]. Then it holds for [formula] that

[formula]

If m  =  1, one has that Υ1(λ1,x1)  =  c1τ1(x1)λn - 21  -  c2 log λ1 (refer to [\eqref=eq-upsilon]). Therefore [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-0] and [formula] imply [formula].

Fixing a sufficiently small number r  >  0, we take x0  =  xiε, f  =  uε and [formula] for [\eqref=eq-poho]. Then from [\eqref=eq-main-e], [\eqref=eq-lin] and the estimate

[formula]

where Proposition [\ref=prop-weak-conv] and Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori-2] are made use of, one finds that the left-hand side of [\eqref=eq-poho] is equal to

[formula]

As a result, [\eqref=eq-poho] reads as

[formula]

where the latter equality is due to Green's identity [\eqref=eq-green-id].

We compute the rightmost side of [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-1] first. Since giε, hiε and [formula] are harmonic near xiε (see [\eqref=eq-g-ie] and [\eqref=eq-h-ie-1] to remind their definitions), a direct computation with [\eqref=eq-g-ie]-[\eqref=eq-h-ie-1], the mean value formula and Green's identity [\eqref=eq-green-id] shows that

[formula]

Moreover, both giε and [formula] are harmonic in [formula], so Green's identity again infers that the value

[formula]

is independent of r  >  0. Thus, taking the limit r  →  0 and applying the Taylor expansion of giε, we find that it is equal to

[formula]

However the quantity [formula] is negligible in the sense that its order is [formula], because [formula] and that [formula] means

[formula]

where [formula] as before. Hence we can conclude that

[formula]

Regarding the leftmost side of [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-1], one gets in a similar fashion to the derivation of [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-2] that

[formula]

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore putting [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-2] and [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-21]-[\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-5] into [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-1] gives that

[formula]

Noticing that each component of [formula] is harmonic, we obtain

[formula]

where the second equality was deduced in [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-24]. Also, by setting f  =  giε, g  =  hiε and x0  =  xiε in the bilinear Pohoaev identity [\eqref=eq-poho], one can verify that

[formula]

Subsequently, [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-6] is reduced to

[formula]

Now we employ [formula] to see that

[formula]

and that [formula], where C2  >  0 is the constant that appeared in [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-24] and c1,c2  >  0 are the numbers in [\eqref=eq-upsilon-2]. Consequently, we have

[formula]

which can be rewritten as

[formula]

This is nothing but [\eqref=eq-est-k_1i-0].

According to [\eqref=eq-k-i2] and Proposition [\ref=prop-weak-conv], we have

[formula]

for any [formula] and [formula]. Hence the proposition follows from [\eqref=eq-v-conv-2], Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori] (or Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori-2]) and Lemma [\ref=lem-est-k_1i].

Characterization of the [formula]-th eigenvalues, [formula]

Our goal in this section is to perform the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-first-2]. For the convenience, we restate it in the following proposition.

Let A2 be the matrix which was introduced in the statement of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-first-2] and [formula] the [formula]-th eigenvalue of A2. For [formula], the [formula]-th eigenvalue [formula] for linear problem [\eqref=eq-lin] satisfies that

[formula]

In addition, the nonzero vector [formula] defined via [\eqref=eq-eigenv-first-2] is an eigenfunction of A2 corresponding to [formula] and satisfies [formula] if [formula].

The next lemma contains a key computation for the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-eigen-cha].

Define

[formula]

for each [formula] and [formula], where the outward unit normal derivative [formula] acts over the x-variable of Green's function G  =  G(x,y). Then they are the value independent of r  >  0 and calculated as

[formula]

As explained in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem-ijl], the integral Jrjl in [\eqref=eq-r-2] is independent of r  >  0, so one may take r  →  0 to find its value. We compute each Jrjl by considering four mutually exclusive cases categorized according to the relation of indices j, l and i.

(1) If j, l  ≠  i, then Jrjl vanishes.

(2) Suppose that j  =  i and l  ≠  i. Since

[formula]

on ∂Bn(xi,r) and

[formula]

near the point xi, we discover

[formula]

(3) In the case that j  ≠  i and l  =  i, a similar argument in (2) applies, yielding

[formula]

(4) Assume that j  =  l  =  i. Then Green's identity [\eqref=eq-green-id] and Lemma [\ref=lem-Green] show that

[formula]

We can deal with [\eqref=eq-r-3] in a similar manner, which we left to the reader.

We reconsider [\eqref=eq-apriori-c], but in this time we allow to put any [formula] and xk [formula] in the place of i0 and x1, respectively. By multiplying [formula] on both sides, we obtain

[formula]

The right-hand side of [\eqref=eq-eigen-cha-1] can be computed as in [\eqref=eq-apriori-d], which turns out to be

[formula]

Meanwhile, if we let [formula] be a nonzero column vector

[formula]

then [\eqref=eq-u-ep-asym] in Lemma [\ref=lem-u-asym] can be written in a vectorial form as [formula] (see [\eqref=eq-mtx-G]). Hence, with the aid of Proposition [\ref=prop-opt-conv] and Lemma [\ref=lem-jjl], it is possible to take ε  →  0 in the left-hand side of [\eqref=eq-eigen-cha-1] to derive

[formula]

where Jik is an m  ×  m matrix having Jrjl;ik defined in [\eqref=eq-r-2] as its components, namely, [formula] for each fixed [formula], and [formula] is an m  ×  mn matrix whose components are

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. From direct computations especially using that

[formula]

for [formula], we conclude

[formula]

with matrices M1, P and Q given in [\eqref=eq-mtx-M_1], [\eqref=eq-mtx-P] and [\eqref=eq-mtx-Q]. The claim that [formula] can be proved as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero], or particularly, [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-4]. The proof is done.

Estimates for the [formula]-th eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, [formula]

We now establish Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-second] by obtaining a series of lemmas. In the first lemma we will compute the limit of the [formula]-th eigenvalues as ε  →  0 when [formula].

If [formula], we have

[formula]

By virtue of Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori] or Corollary [\ref=cor-apriori-2], it is enough to show that [formula]. Referring to [\eqref=eq-u-psi], we let V be a vector space whose basis is

[formula]

If we write [formula] as

[formula]

for some [formula], then we have

[formula]

so it is sufficient to check that [formula]. If we denote [formula] for a fixed i and modify the definition of zε in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-apriori] into [formula], then we again have [formula]. (The definition of [formula], [formula] and wiε can be found in [\eqref=eq-b], [\eqref=eq-c] and [\eqref=eq-w_e].) Moreover computing each of the term of [formula] and [formula] as we did in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-apriori], we find

[formula]

from which one can conclude that μ((n + 2)m)ε  ≤  1 + O(ε). For more detailed computations, we ask for the reader to check the proof of Theorem 1.4 in [\cite=GP].

The following lemma is the counterpart of Proposition [\ref=prop-weak-conv] for [formula].

Let [formula]. For each [formula] and [formula], converges to

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lem-weak-conv] (1) holds in this case also by Lemma [\ref=lem-apriori]. Therefore it is enough to show that the vector [formula] in [\eqref=eq-eigenv-first-2] is zero.

As in [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-4], the orthogonality of [formula] and [formula] for [formula] implies [formula]. However, we also know from Proposition [\ref=prop-eigen-cha] that [formula] serves a basis for [formula]. Hence [formula], concluding the proof.

As a consequence, we reach at

Let A3 be the matrix [\eqref=eq-mtx-A_3]. For [formula], if [formula] is the [formula]-th eigenvalue of A3, then it is positive and the [formula]-th eigenvalue [formula] to problem [\eqref=eq-lin] is estimated as

[formula]

Furthermore, the nonzero vector [formula] in [\eqref=eq-hde] is a corresponding eigenvector to [formula] and [formula] if [formula].

Denote [formula] in the previous lemma. Then we can recover [\eqref=eq-v-conv] from Lemma [\ref=lem-apriori]. Hence the arguments in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-weak-conv] works, giving [\eqref=eq-weak-conv-3] and [\eqref=eq-weak-conv-4] to us again. From them, we conclude that [formula] is positive, [formula] is an eigenvector corresponding to [formula] and [\eqref=eq-eigen-cha-a] is valid. The last orthogonality assertion is deduced in the same way as one in Theorem [\ref=thm-eigen-zero]. See [\eqref=eq-eigen-zero-4].

An moving sphere argument

In this appendix, we show the following proposition by employing the moving sphere argument given in [\cite=LZ] (refer also to [\cite=ChaC]). Note that it implies Proposition [\ref=prop-LZ] at once.

Let r0  >  0 be fixed and p  =  (n + 2) / (n - 2) as above. Suppose that a family {uε}ε of positive C2-functions which satisfy

[formula]

for some c  >  0, and

[formula]

Then there are constants C  >  0 and 0  <  δ0  <  r0 independent of ε  >  0 such that

[formula]

Before conducting its proof, we introduce Green's function GR of -  Δ in Bn(0,R) for each R  >  0 with zero Dirichlet boundary condition. By the scaling invariance, we have

[formula]

Thus we can decompose Green's function in Bn(0,R) into its singular part and regular part as follows:

[formula]

See [\eqref=eq-H] for the definition of the normalizing constant γn.

Now we begin to prove Proposition [\ref=prop-moving]. By [\eqref=eq-a-eq2] and elliptic regularity, for arbitrarily given ζ1  >  0 and any compact set [formula], there is ε1  >  0 such that it holds

[formula]

Let us define the Kelvin transform of uε:

[formula]

and the difference wλε  =  uε  -  uλε between uε and it. Then we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

For any ζ2  >  0, there exist small constants δ1  >  0 and ε2  >  0 such that

[formula]

We first choose a candidate δ1∈(0,r0) for which [\eqref=eq-inf-bound] will have the validity. Fix a sufficiently small value η1  >  0 and a number R0  >  0 such that it holds

[formula]

provided ε  >  0 small enough, where βn  =  (n(n - 2))p - 1 is the constant appeared in [\eqref=eq-U]. Take λ1  =  1 - η1 and λ2  =  1 + η1. If λ  =  λ1, because Uλ1,0  =  Uλ2,0 for any λ  >  0 and uε  →  U1,0 in C1-uniformly over compact subsets of [formula] as ε  →  0, by enlarging R0  >  0 if necessary, we can find a number η2  >  0 small such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for sufficiently small ε  >  0. On the other hand, provided δ1  >  0 small enough, the inequality

[formula]

can be reasoned in the following way. If we choose a function ûε which solves

[formula]

then the comparison principle tells us that uε  ≥  ûε. Since Green's function is always positive, we can make

[formula]

by taking δ1 small, and the relation |x - y|  ≤  (1 - 1 / l)|x| holds for |x|  ≥  lR0 and |y|  ≤  R0 given any l∈(1,  ∞  ), we see from [\eqref=eq-G-R] and [\eqref=eq-u_k] that

[formula]

by choosing l large enough. Also if |x|  ≤  lR0, the uniform convergence of uε to U1,0 implies uε(x)  ≥  (1 - η2)βn|x|2 - n for ε  >  0 sufficiently small. This shows the validity of [\eqref=eq-u_k-2].

Fixing δ1  >  0 for which [\eqref=eq-u_k-2] is valid, suppose that [\eqref=eq-inf-bound] does not hold on the contrary. Then there are sequences {εk}∞k = 1 and {rk}∞k = 1 such that εk  →  0, [formula] and

[formula]

Set uk  =  uεk for brevity. Since uk  →  U1,0 uniformly on any compact set, it should hold that rk  →    ∞  . Therefore

[formula]

To deduce a contradiction, let us apply the moving sphere method to wλk  =  uk  -  uλk for the parameters λ1  ≤  λ  ≤  λ2. Define λ̄k by

[formula]

We claim that λ̄k  =  λ2 for sufficiently large [formula]. First of all, putting together with [\eqref=eq-w_k] and [\eqref=eq-u_k-2], we discover that wλ1k  >  0 in Σλ1, so λ̄k  ≥  λ1. Recall from [\eqref=eq-a-w] that

[formula]

Moreover, from [\eqref=eq-contrary] and [\eqref=eq-u_k-3] we have wλ̄kk > 0 on ∂Bn(0,rk). Thus by the maximum principle and Hopf's lemma we have

[formula]

where ν is the unit outward normal vector. However this means that if λ̄k  <  λ2, then wμk  ≥  0 in Σμ even after taking a slightly larger value of μ than λ̄k, which contradicts the maximality of λ̄k. Hence our claim is justified. Consequently, taking a limit k  →    ∞   to wλ2k  ≥  0 in Σλ2 allows one to get

[formula]

but it cannot be possible since λ2  >  1. Thus [\eqref=eq-inf-bound] should be true.

The following lemma completes our proof of Proposition [\ref=prop-moving].

For some constant C > 0 and parameter δ0∈(0,δ1), we have

[formula]

provided that ε  >  0 is sufficiently small. Here δ1  >  0 is the number chosen in the proof of the previous Lemma.

Argue as in the proof of Lemma 2.4 in [\cite=LZ] employing Lemma [\ref=lem-moser-1] above. In that paper, the statement of the lemma as well as its proof are written for a sequence {uεk}∞k = 1 of solutions, but they apply to a family {uε}ε as well. To proceed our proof, we substitute Gk, Rk and vk in [\cite=LZ] with Dirichlet Green's function Gε-  α0δ1 of -  Δ in Bn(0,ε-  α0δ1), Rε  =  ε-  α0δ1δ2 and uε where δ2∈(0,1) is a sufficiently small number.
