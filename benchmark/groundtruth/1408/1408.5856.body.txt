Asymptotic behavior of global entropy solutions for nonstrictly hyperbolic systems with linear damping

Introduction

In this paper we consider the Cauchy problem to the symmetric system of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with linear damping

[formula]

with initial data

[formula]

This system models of propagation of forward longitudinal and transverse waves of elatic string wich moves in a plane, see [\cite=kk1],[\cite=cristes]. General source term for the system ([\ref=intro-1]) was considered in [\cite=source1]. The damping in the system ([\ref=intro-1]) represents external forces proportional to velocity, and this term can be produce lost of total energy of system. Consider the scalar case,by example

[formula]

From the integral representation of ([\ref=esc1]) it is easy to find the following solution

[formula]

The term bu produce a dissipative effect in the solutions, i.e, the solutions tends to zero when t  →    ∞  . We are looking for condition under wich the terms a, b have a dissipative efect in the solutions of [formula]. Let [formula] be, we are going to show the following main theorem.

If the initial data [formula] then the Cauchy problem ([\ref=intro-1]), ( [\ref=intro-2]) has a weak entropy solutions satisfaying

[formula]

Moreover r(u,v) converges to zero in Lp with exponential time decay, i.e.

[formula]

Preliminars

We start with some preliminaries about the general systems of conservation laws, see [\cite=Bress1] chapter 5. Let [formula] be a smooth vector field. Consider Cauchy problem for the system

[formula]

When g(u) = 0 the system ([\ref=preli1]) is called homogeneous system of conservation laws, if g(u)  ≠  0 the system ([\ref=preli1]) is called inhomogeneous system or balance system of consevation laws. We shall work also with the parabolic perturbation to the system ([\ref=preli1]), namely

[formula]

Denote by A(u) = Df(u) the Jacobian matrix of partial derivates of f.

The system ([\ref=preli1]) is strictly hyperbolic if for every u∈Ω, the matrix A(u) has n real distinct eigenvalues [formula].

Let ri(u) the correspond eigenvetor to λi(u), then

We say that the i-th characteristic field is genuinely non-linear if

[formula]

If instead

[formula]

we say that the i-th characteristic field is linearly degenerate.

For the following definitions see [\cite=smoller], [\cite=source2]

A k-Riemann invariant is a smooth function [formula], such that

[formula]

A pair of function [formula] is called a entropy-entropy flux pair if it satisfies

[formula]

if η(u) is a convex function then the pair (η,q) is called convex entropy-entropy flux pair.

A bounded measurable function u(x,t) is an entropy (or admisible) solution for the Cauchy problem ([\ref=preli1]), if it satisfies the following inequality

[formula]

in the distributional sense, where (η,q) is any convex entropy-entropy flux pair.

We consider the general system of Keyftiz-Kranzer system

[formula]

to get some general observations about this type of systems. Making F(u,v) = (uφ(u,v),vφ(u,v) in ([\ref=intro-1]), we have that the eigenvalues and eigenvector of the Jacobian's matrix Df are given by

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:1]),([\ref=eq:2]) we have that [formula], and [formula], where [formula], then the Riemann invariants are given by

[formula]

The system ([\ref=intro-1]) is always linear degenerate in the first characteristic field. If

[formula]

then the system ([\ref=intro-1]) is strictly hyperbolic and non linear degenerate in the second characteristic field, moreover

[formula]

where H represents the Hessian matrix.

Let [formula] a Lipschitz function in a neighborhod of the origin, q(u,v) = ψ(u,v) + η(u,v)φ(u,v) be a function, shuch that ψ satisfies

[formula]

Then the pair

[formula]

is a entropy-entropy flux pair for the system ([\ref=intro-1]). Moreover if η(u,v) is a convex function, then the pair ([\ref=intro-4]) is a convex entropy-entropy flux pair.

Global existence of weak entropy solutions and asymptotic behavior

We consider the parabolic regularization of the system ([\ref=intro-1]), namely

[formula]

whit initial data

[formula]

where jε is a mollifier. In this case φ(u,v) = φ(r), with [formula]. By ([\ref=eq:1]) the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are given by

[formula]

The following conditions will be nesessaries in our next discution

lim r  →  orφ(r) = 0, rφ'(r)  ≠  0

a > b

The condition [formula] garanties the strictly hyperbolicity to the system ([\ref=g-2]), while condition [formula] ensure the existence of a positive invarian region. Now we consider the following subset of [formula]

[formula]

We affirm that Σ is an invariant region. Let h(u,v) = (au,bv) be, if [formula] where γ1 is the level curve of Z = φ(r) we have that

[formula]

and if [formula] where γ2 is the level curve of Z we have that

[formula]

with i = 1,2., then by the Theorem 14.7 of [\cite=smoller], Σ is an invariant region for the system ([\ref=g-1]).Is easy to verify that (au,bv) satisfies the condition [formula] in [\cite=source1], thus we have the following Lemma.

If (u0,v0)∈Σ and the [formula] conditions holds, then the Cauchy problem ([\ref=g-1]),([\ref=g-2]) has a global weak entropy solution.

Now for the global behavior of solutions, using ideas of the author in [\cite=panov2], we construct the following entropy-entropy flux pairs

[formula]

From ([\ref=intro-3]) we have

[formula]

Integrating by parts we have that

[formula]

integrating by parts we have

[formula]

Let M =  sup (u,v)∈[null]  ×  [null]{φ(r)}, then we have that

[formula]

Multiplying in ([\ref=intro-1]) by [formula] we have that

[formula]

Now we choose [formula] a function such a |h'(x)|  ≤  1, |h''(x)|  ≤  1 and h(x) = |x| for |x|  ≥  1 and set k(x) = e- h(x), then k'(x)  ≤  k(x). Multiplying by k(x) in ([\ref=entro-2]), and inegrating over x we have

[formula]

by the inequality ([\ref=entro-1]) we have

[formula]

If [formula] we have

[formula]

by Gronwall's inequality we have

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

Passing to limit m  →    ∞   in ([\ref=entro-5]) we have the inequality ([\ref=in3])
