A collection of metric Mahler measures

Introduction

Let f be a polynomial with complex coefficients given by We define the (logarithmic) Mahler measure M of f by If α is a non-zero algebraic number, we define the Mahler measure of α by In other words, M(α) is simply the Mahler measure of the minimal polynomial of α over [formula]. It is well-known that

[formula]

for all algebraic numbers α.

It is a consequence of a theorem of Kronecker that M(α)  =  0 if and only if α is a root of unity. In a famous 1933 paper, D.H. Lehmer [\cite=Lehmer] asked whether there exists a constant c > 0 such that M(α)  ≥  c in all other cases. He could find no algebraic number with Mahler measure smaller than that of which is approximately [formula]. Although the best known general lower bound is due to Dobrowolski [\cite=Dobrowolski], uniform lower bounds haven been established in many special cases (see [\cite=BDM] [\cite=Schinzel] [\cite=Smyth], for instance). Furthermore, numerical evidence provided by Mossinghoff [\cite=Moss] [\cite=MossWeb] and Mossinghoff, Pinner and Vaaler [\cite=MPV] suggests there does, in fact, exist such a constant c. This leads to the following conjecture, which we will now call Lehmer's conjecture.

There exists a real number c  >  0 such that if [formula] is not a root of unity then M(α)  ≥  c.

In an effort to create a geometric structure on the multiplicative group of algebraic numbers [formula], Dubickas and Smyth [\cite=DubSmyth2] constructed a metric version of the Mahler measure. Let us briefly recall this construction. Write

[formula]

to denote the restricted infinite direct product of [formula]. Let [formula] be defined by and note that τ is indeed a group homomorphism. The metric Mahler measure M1 of α is given by We note that the infimum in the definition of M1(α) is taken over all ways of writing α as a product of elements in [formula]. As a result of this construction, the function M1 satisfies that triangle inequality

[formula]

for all [formula]. It can be shown that M1(α)  =  0 if and only if α is a root of unity, and moreover, M1 is well-defined on the quotient group [formula]. Using [\eqref=MahlerInverses] and [\eqref=MahlerTriangle], we find that the map (α,β)  ↦  M1(αβ- 1) is a metric on G. It is noted in [\cite=DubSmyth2] that this map yields the discrete topology if and only if Lehmer's conjecture is true.

Following the strategy of [\cite=DubSmyth2], Fili and the author [\cite=FiliSamuels] examined a non-Archimedean version of the metric Mahler measure. That is, define the ultrametric Mahler measure M∞ of α by replacing the sum in the definition of M1 by a maximum. In this case, M∞ has the strong triangle inequality for all [formula]. Once again, we are able to verify that M∞ is well-defined on G. Here, the map (α,β)  ↦  M∞(αβ- 1) yields a non-Archimedean metric on G which induces the discrete topology if and only if Lehmer's conjecture is true.

In view of the definitions of M1 and M∞, it is natural to define a collection of intermediate metric Mahler measures in the following way. If x∈(0,  ∞  ], we define [formula]. Then there exists a point [formula] such that Mx(α)  =  Mx().

We now turn our attention momentarily to the computation of some values of Mx(α). First define and note that by Northcott's Theorem [\cite=Northcott], the infimum on the right hand side of this definition is always achieved. In paricular, this means that C(α)  >  0.

The author [\cite=Samuels2] gave a strategy for reducing the computation of M∞(α) to a finite set. The method uses the modified Mahler measure

[formula]

and gives the value of M∞ in terms of [formula]. Although [formula] requires taking an infimum over an infinite set, it is often very reasonable to calculate. Indeed, the infimum on the right hand side of [\eqref=MBarDef] is always attained at a root of unity ζ that makes deg (ζα) as small as possible. This function [formula] arises again when computing Mx(α) for small x in a more straightforward way than in [\cite=Samuels2].

If α is a non-zero algebraic number and x is a positive real number satisfying

[formula]

then Mx(α)  =  (α).

As we will discuss in detail in section [\ref=AbelianHeights], the construction given by [\eqref=xMetricMahlerDef] is not unique to the Mahler measure. Suppose [formula]. We are able to show that [formula] belongs to S(M). Moreover, it is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=SmallP] that [formula] is the minimal element of S(M).

We have that ∈S(M). Moreover, if ψ∈S(M) then ψ(α)  ≥  (α) for all [formula].

We now ask if the map x  ↦  Mx(α) is continuous on [formula] for every algebraic number α. We recall that Theorem [\ref=Achieved] asserts that, for each x, there exists a point ∈τ- 1(α) that attains the infimum in the definition of Mx(α). If the infimum is achieved at the same point [formula] for all real x, then we have that which clearly defines a continuous function. Unfortunately, using the example of Mx(p2) for a rational prime p, we see that this is not the case.

Let p be a rational prime and assume that [formula] with [formula].

If x  ·  ( log  log (p2)  -   log  log 2)  <   log 2 then precisely one point αn differs from a root of unity.

If x > 1 then at least two points αn differ from a root of unity.

Although the infimum in Mx(α) is not achieved at the same point for all x, we are able to prove that x  ↦  Mx(α) is continuous for all α.

If α is a non-zero algebraic number then the map x  ↦  Mx(α) is continuous on the positive real numbers.

It is worth noting that continuity appears to be somewhat special to the Mahler measure. That is, we cannot expect an arbitrary function φ satisfying [\eqref=BasicHeightProps] to be such that x  ↦  φx(α) is continuous. Even making a slight modification to the Mahler measure causes continuity to fail. For example, define the Weil height of [formula] by and note that, in view of our remarks about the Mahler measure, h(α)  =  0 if and only if α is a root of unity. In fact, it is well-known that

[formula]

for all roots of unity ζ. Moreover, we have that h(α)  =  h(α- 1) for all [formula] so that h satisfies [\eqref=BasicHeightProps]. Unlike the Mahler measure, we know how to compute hx(α) for every x and α.

If α is a non-zero algebraic number then

As we have noted, Theorem [\ref=WeilHeightComp] does indeed show that x  ↦  hx(α) is possibly discontinuous. More specifically, it is continuous if and only if α is a root of unity.

Heights on Abelian groups

In this section, we generalize our x-metric Mahler measure construction to a very broad class of functions on an abelian group G by exploring definition [\eqref=xMetricSwitchDef] in more detail. We are able to establish some basic properties in this situation that we can use to prove our main results.

Let G be a multiplicatively written abelian group. We say that φ:G  →  [null] with x  ≥  y. If φ is an x-metric height on G then φ is also a y-metric height on G.

If a,b and q are real numbers with a,b  ≥  0 and q  ≥  1, then it is easily verified that

[formula]

Let us now assume that φ has the x-triangle inequality and that α,β∈G. If x = y  =    ∞   then the lemma is completely trivial. If x  =    ∞   and y  <    ∞   then we have that so that the result follows easily as well. Hence, we assume now that ∞    >  x  ≥  y. In this situation, we have that x / y  ≥  1. Therefore, by [\eqref=MVTapp] we have that and it follows that Hence, we have that φ(αβ)  ≤  (φ(α)y  +  φ(β)y)1 / y so that φ has the y-triangle inequaity.

We now observe that each x-metric height is well-defined on the quotient group G / Z(φ). In the case that x  ≥  1, the map (α,β)  ↦  φ(αβ- 1) defines a metric on G / Z(φ).

If φ:G  →  [0,   ∞   )isanx  -  metricheightforsomex∈(0,   ∞ ] then

Z(φ) is a subgroup of G.

φ(ζα)  =  φ(α) for all α∈G and ζ∈Z(φ). That is, φ is well-defined on the quotient G / Z(φ).

If x  ≥  1, then the map (α,β)  ↦  φ(αβ- 1) defines a metric on G / Z(φ).

We first establish [\eqref=Subgroup]. Obviously, we have that 1∈Z(G) by definition of height. Further, if φ(α)  =  0 then again by definition of height we know that φ(α- 1)  =  0. If α,β∈Z(G) then using the x triangle inequality we obtain Therefore, αβ∈Z(G) so that Z(G) forms a subgroup.

To prove [\eqref=WellDefined], we see that the x-triangle inequality yields

[formula]

implying that φ(α)  =  φ(ζα).

Finally, if x  ≥  1 then Lemma [\ref=Intermediates] implies that φ has the triangle inequality. It then follows immediately that the map (α,β)  ↦  φ(αβ- 1) is a metric on G / Z(φ).

We are careful to note that if x < 1 then the map (α,β)  ↦  φ(αβ- 1) does not, in general, form a metric on G / Z(φ). In this case, the x-triangle inequality is indeed weaker than the triangle inequality, so we cannot expect the above map to form a metric except in trivial cases.

We now follow the method of Dubickas and Smyth for creating a metric from the Mahler measure. Write and, as before, let τ:X(G)  →  G be defined by so that τ is a group homomorphism. For each point x∈(0,  ∞  ] we define the map φx:X(G)  →  [null] then φy  ≥  φx.

For the proofs of [\eqref=MetricHeightConversion]-[\eqref=NoChangeMetric], we will assume that x  <    ∞  . The proofs for the case x  =    ∞   are quite similar to the proofs for other cases so we will not include them here. See [\cite=FiliSamuels] for detailed proofs when x =   ∞  .

To prove [\eqref=MetricHeightConversion], let α,β∈G. We observe that if [formula] and [formula] then it is obvious that We may also write implying that [formula]. In other words, we have that

[formula]

This yields that

[formula]

We note that

[formula]

Then using [\eqref=InfIncrease] we find that

[formula]

and it follows that To complete the proof of [\eqref=MetricHeightConversion], we observe that [formula] so that φx(α)  ≤  φ(α) for all α∈G.

To prove [\eqref=BestMetricHeight], we note that

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from the fact that ψ has the x-triangle inequality.

To prove [\eqref=NoChangeMetric], we first observe that if φ  =  φx then clearly φ is an x-metric height. If φ is already a metric height, then by [\eqref=BestMetricHeight], we obtain that φ  ≤  φx. But we always have φx  ≤  φ so the result follows. Of course, φx is an x-metric height so this yields immediately φx  =  (φx)x.

To establish [\eqref=Comparisons], we see that

[formula]

But we have that x  ≥  y so that x / y  ≥  1. Therefore, by Lemma [\ref=MVTapp] we have that which yields φy(α)  ≥  φx(α).

For a given height φ on G, let S(φ) denote the set of all heights ψ on G such that ψx  =  φx for all x∈(0,  ∞  ]. Further, define the height φ0 by

[formula]

By [\eqref=MetricHeightConversion] of Theorem [\ref=MetricConstruction], we know that φx  ≤  φ for all x. Moreover, [\eqref=Comparisons] of the same theorem states that x  ↦  φx(α) is non-increasing. This means that the limit on the right hand side of [\eqref=OptimalFunction] does indeed exist and

[formula]

for all x∈(0,  ∞  ]. We now observe that φ0 is the minimal element of S(φ).

If φ is a height on G then φ0∈S(φ). Moreover, if ψ∈S(φ) then ψ  ≥  φ0.

As we have noted, φ0  ≥  φx for all x. Hence, we obtain immediately that (φ0)x  ≥  (φx)x  =  φx. On the other hand, we know that φx  ≤  φ so that for all α∈G. In other words, we have that φ0  ≤  φ so that (φ0)x  ≤  φx establishing the first statement of the theorem.

To prove the second statement, assume that ψ∈S(φ) so that φx  =  ψx for all x. Hence we have that for all α∈G verifying the theorem.

We now define the modified version of φ by In the case of the Mahler measure, we have stated in the introduction that   =  φ0. However, in the general case, we can conclude only that [formula] belongs to S(φ).

If φ is a height on G then ∈S(φ).

We must show that x  =  φx for all x∈(0,  ∞  ]. Since 1∈Z(φ), we have immediately that   ≤  φ, which means that Now for any α∈G, we have that implying that φx  ≤  . Then taking x-metric versions and using [\eqref=NoChangeMetric] of Theorem [\ref=MetricConstruction] we find that completing the proof.

We may now ask what we can say about the map x  ↦  φx(α) for fixed φ and α. As we have noted, this map is non-increasing for all α. Since φx(α) is bounded from above and below by constants not depending on x, both left and right hand limits exist at every point. Moreover, we always have when x̄ > 0. We say that a map [formula] is left or right semi-continuous at a point [formula] if respectively. Indeed, f is continuous at x̄ if and only if f is both left and right semi-continuous at x̄. Although it is a consequence of Theorem [\ref=WeilHeightComp] that x  ↦  φx(α) is not continuous in general, we can prove the following partial result.

If φ is a height on G and α∈G, then the map x  ↦  φx(α) is left semi-continous on the positive real numbers.

We already know that lim x  →  x̄-φx(α)  ≥  φx̄(α) so we assume that

[formula]

Therefore, there exists ε > 0 such that

[formula]

By definition of φx̄, we may choose points [formula] such that [formula] and and define the function fε by This yields

[formula]

Also, since fε is continuous, we have that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=EpsilonSqueeze], [\eqref=FApprox] and [\eqref=FCont] we obtain that which is a contradiction.

The Inifimum in Mx(α)

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=Achieved] will require the use of two results from [\cite=Samuels]. The first of these is Theorem 2.1 of [\cite=Samuels], which shows that for any point ∈τ- 1(α), there exists another point [formula] which has pointwise smaller Mahler measures. We state the Theorem using the notation of [\cite=Samuels].

If [formula] are non-zero algebraic numbers with [formula] then there exists a root of unity ζ and algebraic numbers [formula] satifying

[formula],

[formula] for all n,

M(βn)  ≤  M(αn) for all n.

In view of Theorem [\ref=Reduction], for each x, we need only consider only points [formula] in the definition of Mx(α). In other words, in the case of x  <    ∞  , the definition of Mx(α) may be rewritten

[formula]

Similar remarks apply in the case that x  =    ∞  . Therefore, it will be useful to have some control of the Mahler measures in the subgroup [formula]. For this purpose, we borrow Lemma 3.1 of [\cite=Samuels].

Let K be a Galois extension of [formula]. If [formula] then there exists a root of unity ζ and [formula] such that ζγL∈K and In particular, the set is finite for every B  ≥  0.

It is an easy consequence of Lemma [\ref=HeightInK] that M(γ) is bounded below by the Mahler measure of an element in K. Indeed, we have that and ζγL∈K. In particular, we recall that C(α) denotes the minimum Mahler measure in the field Kα. We now see easily that

[formula]

for all [formula]. We are now prepared to prove Theorem [\ref=Achieved].

By the results of [\cite=Samuels], we know that the theorem holds for x  =    ∞  , so we may assume that x  <    ∞  . Further, select a real number B  >  Mx(α). In view of Theorem [\ref=Reduction], we know that Mx(α) is the infimum of

[formula]

over the set of all [formula] and all points [formula] such that

[formula],

At most one point αn is a root of unity,

[formula] for all n, and

[formula].

We will show that the set of all values of [\eqref=FiniteHope] is finite for [formula] satisfying conditions [\eqref=Product]-[\eqref=BBound].

We must first give an upper bound on N. We know that at least N - 1 of the points [formula] are not roots of unity. For all such points, we have that by [\eqref=RadBound]. Combining this with [\eqref=BBound], we obtain that which yields

[formula]

Also by [\eqref=BBound], it follows that M(αn)  ≤  B for all n. Moreover, since [formula], the second statement of Lemma [\ref=HeightInK] implies that there are only finitely many possible values for M(αn) for each n. Since N is bounded above by the right hand side of [\eqref=NUpperBound], it follows that there are only finitely many possible values for [\eqref=FiniteHope] with [formula] satisfying [\eqref=Product]-[\eqref=BBound]. We now know that Mx(α) is an infimum over a finite set, so the infimum must be achieved.

Minimality of [formula]

We first give the proof of Theorem [\ref=SmallP] showing that Mx(α)  =  (α) for sufficiently small values of x.

By Theorem [\ref=BarPhiMetrics], we have immediately that Mx(α)  =  x(α) for all x, so it follows that

[formula]

Now we must prove the opposite inequality.

We know by Theorem [\ref=Achieved] that there exist points [formula] such that We know that α is not a root of unity, so at least one of [formula] is not a root of unity.

We now consider two cases. First, assume that precisely one of [formula] is not a root of unity. In other words, there exists a root of unity ζ and a point [formula] such that α  =  ζβ and Of course, we also have β  =  αζ- 1 so that Combining this inequality with [\eqref=EasyUpperBound], the result follows.

Next, assume that at least two of [formula] are not a roots of unity. By Lemma [\ref=HeightInK], we know that M(αn)  ≥  C(α) whenever αn is not a root of unity. Hence, we obtain that so that

[formula]

By our assumption, we have that which implies that

[formula]

It now follows from [\eqref=TwoBound] that completing the proof.

Next, we establish Corollary [\ref=MBarMinimal] showing that [formula] is minimal in the set S(M).

We observe again by Theorem [\ref=BarPhiMetrics] that ∈S(M). By Theorem [\ref=SmallP], for all sufficiently small x, we have that (α)  =  Mx(α). Hence, it follows that that and the result follows from Theorem [\ref=OptimalMinimal].

We begin our proof of Theorem [\ref=NotUniform] by giving a slight modification to Theorem [\ref=SmallP]. More specifically, it will be useful to consider what happens when the supposed inequality [\eqref=AlwaysX] is replaced by a strict inequality.

Let α be a non-zero algebraic number different from a root of unity and x a positive real number satisfying Then any point [formula] that achieves the infimum in the definition of Mx(α) has precisely one component αn that is not a root of unity.

We recall first that

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=BarPhiMetrics]. Next, we note that

[formula]

Assume that [formula] are such that

[formula]

and at least two of the points [formula] are not roots of unity. By Theorem [\ref=Reduction], there exists a root of unity ζ and points [formula] such that for all n. If for any n we have that M(βn)  <  M(αn), then which contradicts the right hand side of [\eqref=AchievedApplication]. Therefore, we have that M(βn)  =  M(αn) for all n. In particular, at least two of the points [formula] are not roots of unity. Furthermore, since each [formula], we may apply Lemma [\ref=HeightInK] to see that M(βn)  ≥  C(α) whenever βn is not a root of unity. This yields which implies that However, we now have the strict inequality [\eqref=LooseBound] which gives 21 / x  >  (α) / C(α) and contradicting [\eqref=MexUpper]. Therefore, exactly one point among [formula] is not a root of unity.

Before we prove Theorem [\ref=NotUniform], we recall our remark that (α) is often very reasonable to compute so that Theorem [\ref=SmallP] and Lemma [\ref=StrongSmallP] are useful in applications. The following proof is a typical example.

Let α  =  p2. In order to prove [\eqref=P2Small], we wish to apply Lemma [\ref=StrongSmallP], so we must compute the values of (α) and C(α). We begin by observing that Then by [\eqref=WeilHeightDefined], we obtain that

[formula]

It is clear that the infimum on the right hand side of [\eqref=MBarM] is achieved since it is an infimum over positive integers. More specifically, it is achieved by a root of unity ζ that makes deg (ζα) as small as possible. In our case, α is rational, so this occurs when ζ  =  1 leaving

[formula]

In addition, we know that [formula] so that C(α)  =   log 2 which now gives By Lemma [\ref=StrongSmallP], we know that any point [formula] that attains the infimum in Mx(α)  =  Mx(p2) must have precisely one point αn that is not a root of unity. This completes the proof of [\eqref=P2Small].

To prove [\eqref=P2Large], we take x  >  1 and assume that [formula] attains the infimum in the definition of Mx(p2) where are most one point αn is different from a root of unity. Therefore, there exists a root of unity ζ and an algebraic number β such that Hence we find immediately that Since x  >  1, this yields that On the other hand, we have that β  =  ζ- 1p2 so that, using [\eqref=AlphaUpper], we obtain which is a contradiction. Thus, at least two points among [formula] must not be roots of unity.

Continuity of x  ↦  Mx(α)

We have already proved that, for any height function φ, the map x  ↦  φx(α) is left semi-continuous. In general, we know that such functions are not always right semi-continuous. However, we are able to use Theorem [\ref=Achieved] and our observations about the Mahler measure to establish right semi-continuity in this case.

If α is a root of unity, then Mx(α)  =  0 for all x, so we may assume that α is not a root of unity. Furthermore, we know by Theorem [\ref=LeftSemiContinuous] that this map is left semi-continuous at all points, so it remains only to show that it is right semi-continuous.

Now let x̄ > 0 be a real number, so we must show that

[formula]

Since x  ↦  Mx(α) is decreasing, we know that the left hand side of [\eqref=RightSemiEnd] exists. Moreover, we have that

[formula]

Now we select a point y∈(x̄,x̄ + 1]. By Theorem [\ref=Achieved], there must exist points and [formula] such that Since My(α)  ≤  M(α), we may assume without loss of generality that M(αn)  ≤  M(α) for all n. Furthermore, since α is not a root of unity, we know that N  ≥  1. For simplicity, we write now an  =  M(αn) so that and note that by Lemma [\ref=HeightInK], we have that

[formula]

Next, we define the function fy by and note that fy does indeed depend on y because the points ζ and [formula] depend on y. We now have immediately that

[formula]

Since [formula], we know that and therefore, we obtain that

[formula]

We know that an  >  0 for all n implying that fy(x)  >  0 for all x, so we may define the function gy(x)  =   log fy(x). Since fy is differentiable on the positive real numbers, we know that gy is as well. Therefore, we may apply the Mean Value Theorem to it on

[formula]

Weil height

Before we begin our proof of Theorem [\ref=WeilHeightComp], we recall that if N is any integer, then it is well-known that

[formula]

for all algebraic numbers α. Using this fact, we are able to proceed with our proof.

First assume that x  ≤  1. By [\eqref=MetricHeightConversion] of Theorem [\ref=MetricConstruction], we have that hx(α)  ≤  h(α). But also, it is well-known that h is already a 1-metric height. Therefore, [\eqref=NoChangeMetric] of Theorem [\ref=MetricConstruction] implies that h1(α)  =  h(α). Then by [\eqref=Comparisons] of Theorem [\ref=MetricConstruction], we conclude that hx(α)  ≥  h(α) verifying the theorem in the case that x  ≤  1.

Next, we assume that x  >  1. Let N be a positive integer and select [formula] such that βN  =  α. Therefore, we have that Then using [\eqref=IntPowers] we obtain that h(α)  =  N  ·  h(β) which yields

[formula]

Since x  >  1, the right hand side of [\eqref=TightUpper] tends to zero as N  →    ∞   completing the proof.
