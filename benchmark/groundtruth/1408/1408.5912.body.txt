Radiative Return for Heavy Higgs Boson at a Muon Collider

Introduction

With the discovery of the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson (h) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [\cite=Aad:2012tfa] [\cite=Chatrchyan:2012ufa], the follow-up examinations of its properties at the LHC and future colliders will be of high priority for collider physics. While an electron-position collider near the Zh threshold or utilizing weak boson fusion as a "Higgs Factory" may provide high precision measurement for its couplings in a model-independent way [\cite=Peskin:2012we] [\cite=Asner:2013psa] [\cite=Han:2013kya], a muon-antimuon collider could directly and accurately determine its total width, mass and couplings via the s-channel resonant production of a Higgs boson [\cite=Barger:1995hr] [\cite=Barger:1996jm] [\cite=Han:2012rb] [\cite=Conway:2013lca] [\cite=Alexahin:2013ojp].

However, the Higgs sector may not be as simple as it is in the minimal electroweak theory. A wide class of new physics scenarios, ranging from supersymmetry (SUSY) [\cite=Gunion:1984yn] to models of neutrino mass generation [\cite=Konetschny:1977bn] [\cite=Cheng:1980qt] [\cite=Lazarides:1980nt] [\cite=Schechter:1980gr] [\cite=Mohapatra:1980yp], postulates the existence of an extended sector of fundamental scalars. While such an extension could leave some imprint on the properties of the recently discovered Higgs boson, it is also imperative that the proposed future colliders should have the potential to identify additional scalars that could be produced within its kinematic reach. Due to the rather weak couplings and the large SM backgrounds, the LHC will have limited coverage for such search [\cite=Gianotti:2002xx] [\cite=Lewis:2013fua] [\cite=Li:2013nma] [\cite=Dawson:2013bba] [\cite=Coleppa:2014hxa]. At a future lepton collider, on the other hand, due to the clean experimental environment, it would be straightforward to identify a heavy Higgs signal once it is copiously produced on resonance [\cite=Eichten:2013ckl].

The exact center-of-mass energy required for an optimal heavy Higgs signal depends on the unknown heavy Higgs mass, in particular for the s-channel resonant production at a muon collider. The situation may be remedied if instead we consider associated production of a Higgs boson with other particles. A particularly interesting process is the "radiative return" (RR) process. In the case of the Higgs boson production, the processes under consideration are

[formula]

where H (A) is a heavy neutral CP-even (CP-odd) state, respectively. When the center of mass energy of the muon collider is above the heavy Higgs resonance, the photon emission from the initial state provides an opportunity of the heavy Higgs boson "back" to the resonance. For this, one does not need to know the mass of the (unknown) heavy scalar. This mechanism alone could also provide an excellent channel to measure the invisible decay of the heavy Higgs boson. Without losing generality, we illustrate our main points with a notation in the context of a two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [\cite=Haber:1978jt], where the vacuum expectation values (vev) of both the doublets contribute to the W- and Z-masses.

In Sec. [\ref=sec:RR], we first present the radiative return production of heavy Higgs boson in μ+μ- collision in detail. We also consider the production l+l-  →  ZH and l+l-  →  AH (l = e,μ) in Sec. [\ref=sec:pair]. To make the illustration more concrete, we compare these production modes in Sec. [\ref=sec:comp] in the framework of 2HDM. Because of the rather clean experimental environment and the model-independent reconstruction of the Higgs signal events at lepton colliders, we also study the sensitivity of the invisible decay from the radiative return process in Sec. [\ref=sec:invi]. Finally, we summarize our results and conclude in Sec. [\ref=sec:sum].

Production Mechanisms

Perhaps the most useful feature of a muon collider is the potential to have s-channel resonant production of the Higgs boson [\cite=Barger:1995hr] [\cite=Barger:1996jm] [\cite=Han:2012rb] [\cite=Eichten:2013ckl] [\cite=Alexahin:2013ojp]. As has been already mentioned in the previous section, such a machine undoubtedly has its merits in analyzing in detail the already discovered Higgs boson near 125 GeV. When it comes to identifying a heavier additional (pseudo)scalar, however, we do not have any a priori knowledge about the mass, rendering the new particle search rather difficult. If one envisions a rather wide-ranged scanning, it would require to devote a large portion of the design integrated luminosity [\cite=Conway:2013lca] [\cite=Alexahin:2013ojp]. In this section, we discuss the three different production mechanisms for the associated production of the heavy Higgs boson. Besides the "radiative return" as in Eq. ([\ref=eq:rr]), we also consider

[formula]

The relevant Feynman diagrams are all shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Feyn].

We first parametrize the relevant heavy Higgs boson couplings as

[formula]

The two parameters κμ and κZ characterize the coupling strength with respect to the SM Higgs boson couplings to μ+μ- and ZZ. The coupling κμ controls the heavy Higgs resonant production and the radiative return cross sections, while κZ controls the cross sections for ZH associated production and heavy Higgs pair HA production. We have used κμ as the common scale parameter for Yukawa couplings of both the CP-even H and the CP-odd A, although in principle they could be different. For the HAZ coupling we have used the generic 2HDM relation: κZ is proportional to cos (β  -  α) and the HAZ coupling is proportional to sin (β  -  α). In the heavy Higgs decoupling limit of 2HDM at large mA, [formula] is highly suppressed and κμ  ≈   tan β ( -  cot β) in Type-II [\cite=Hall:1981bc] [\cite=Donoghue:1978cj] and lepton-specific [\cite=Barger:1989fj] [\cite=Aoki:2009ha] [\cite=Pich:2009sp] [\cite=Branco:2011iw] (Type-I [\cite=Haber:1978jt] [\cite=Hall:1981bc] and flipped [\cite=Barger:1989fj] [\cite=Aoki:2009ha] [\cite=Pich:2009sp] [\cite=Branco:2011iw]) 2HDM. Note that many SUSY models, including MSSM and NMSSM, are essentially Type-II 2HDM, subject to fewer tree-level parameters for the Higgs potential and potentially large supersymmetric loop corrections. We tabulate our choices of parameters and their 2HDM correspondences in Table. [\ref=tab:parameters]. We reiterate that such a notation can be carried over to any scenario where there is another multiplet in addition to the SM Higgs doublet contributing to the W- and Z-masses, whereby the WW and ZZ couplings of the two neutral CP-even scalars are connected by a unitary relationship, with some SU(2) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients arising in addition.

We choose the following configuration as shown in Table [\ref=tab:MuC] for the muon collider parameters and the detector acceptance, to study feasibilities of these different production channels. The beam energy spread is defined as

[formula]

with [formula].

Radiative Return

Due to the "radiative return", when the heavy Higgs boson mass is below the center of mass energy of the muon collider, the photon emission from the initial state provides an opportunity of the heavy Higgs boson "back" to resonance. The signature is quite striking: a mono-chromatic photon plus other recoil particles. The "recoil mass" is a sharp resonant peak at [formula], manifesting itself from the continuous background. This photon's energy is subject to the beam energy spread and detector energy smearing. The tagging of the heavy Higgs boson from its decay product, if necessary, provides extra handle on reducing the background and increasing the significance.

Signal and Background

The characteristics of this RR signal is a photon with the energy given by

[formula]

from which one constructs a recoil mass peaked at the heavy Higgs mass mH / A. The energy of this photon is smeared by the following factors: detector photon energy resolution, collider beam energy spread, additional (soft) ISR/FSR, and heavy Higgs total width. Our choice of the detector photon energy resolution and beam energy spread are as shown in Table [\ref=tab:MuC]. The beam energy spread and (soft) ISR are of GeV level [\cite=Delahaye:2013jla]. When the Higgs boson mass is significantly below the beam energy, the recoil mass construction receives large smearing due to the energy resolution for the very energetic photon.

Besides the Higgs boson mass, the other most important parameter is the total width, which effectively smears the mono-chromatic photons as well. We calculate the total width as a sum of the partial widths to fermion pairs for Type II 2HDM in Fig. [\ref=fig:width]. In this model, κμ  =   tan β in the decoupling limit. The total width is minimized when [formula]. Because of the quadratic dependence, there are typically two values to give the same width tan β1  ·   tan β2  =  mt  /  mb. Numerically we take mt / mb  =  42. We can see that typically the total width ranges from a few GeV to hundreds of GeV. The total width of heavy Higgs boson could remain small in lepton-specific 2HDM. We thus choose three representative values for the total width: 1, 10, and 100 GeV for later discussions.

The inclusive cross section for mono-photon background is very large in comparison with the radiative return signal. The background is mainly from the Möller scattering with ISR/FSR μ+μ-  →  μ+μ-γ, and the W exchange with ISR μ+μ-  →  ννγ. The signal background ratio is typically of the order 10- 3 for a 3 TeV muon collider. As a result, for the discovery through the RR process, we need to rely on some exclusive processes, or to the least veto mono-photon plus missing energy and mono-photon plus dimuon exclusive channels.

It should be noted that, in a 2HDM, the heavy neutral scalar H may decay into both t, b and τ+τ- modes, where the branching ratios depend on tan β. We adopt the Type-II 2HDM for illustration. We show in Fig. [\ref=fig:sigbkg] the total cross sections (left panel) for μ+μ-  →  H / Aγ  →  qγ (for q  =  t,b) for tan β = 5,40, with the basic cuts applied on the photon. It is clear from the plots that while the rates for tγ is considerably suppressed for large values of tan β, it can be of comparable magnitude (or even larger) to that for bγ for relatively low tan β. Judicious criteria for event selection, therefore, need to be developed for both channels. In the rest of the present study, however, only the b mode is considered for simplicity.

To be more specific, we choose the b final state as a benchmark with heavy Higgs boson decay branching fraction (Br) to this final state to be 80%. We also assume 80% b-tagging efficiency and require at least one b-jet tagged. In fact, any visible decay of the heavy Higgs boson except for the dimuon final state, negligible in most of models, would be very efficient in background suppression. One could also interpret our assumption as that 80% of the decays of the Higgs boson could be utilized.

We employ Madgraph5 [\cite=Alwall:2011uj] and for parton level signal and background simulations and tuned Pythia 6.4 [\cite=Sjostrand:2006za] mainly for ISR and FSR, and further implement detector smearing and beam energy spread with our own code. We show the recoil mass distribution for the heavy Higgs boson mass of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.9 TeV each with 1, 10, 100 GeV width at a 3 TeV muon collider in Fig. [\ref=fig:sigbkg] (right panel). Both cross sections of the signal and the background at fixed beam energy increase as the recoil mass increases due to the infrared nature of the photon radiation. The spread of recoil mass peak increases at a lower mass, due to the larger photon energy detector resolution smearing at a higher photon energy. We can see that the pronounced mass peaks look promising for the signal observation, and the RR process is a plausible discovery production mechanism that does not rely on the precise knowledge of the new heavy Higgs boson mass. We discuss the observability of this mode in next subsection.

Estimated Sensitivities

To quantify the reach of the signal observation, we choose different bin sizes according to the spread of the photon energy distribution. This is because the recoil mass spread is broader than the photon energy smearing, as scaled by a factor of [formula]. This implies the Higgs mass resolution would be much worse than the photon energy resolution if the mass is far away from the beam energy. We find the bin sizes in step of 1 GeV that optimize statistical significance of signal at κμ = 10 over the background. With this optimal choice of number of bins, we show the 2σ exclusion (solid) and 5σ discovery (dashed) limits from RR in Fig. [\ref=fig:RRsensi] for both 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV muon colliders as described in Table [\ref=tab:MuC], for three different benchmark heavy Higgs width values 1, 10, and 100 GeV in red, blue, and green, respectively. The results show that the RR production mode could cover a large κμ (tan β in Type II 2HDM) region. To put these results into perspective, we reproduce the LHC curves for the discovery reach on the mA  -   tan β plane in solid black lines for 300 fb- 1 and 3000 fb- 1 [\cite=Gianotti:2002xx]. These LHC discovery projections are mainly from searches on heavier Higgs bosons decaying into SM particles such as τ+τ- and t, in the maximal mixing scenario in the MSSM. This wedge shape indicates the LHCs limitation in discovering heavy Higgs bosons in the medium tan β range, roughly when the production rate is minimal for the MSSM as a Type-II 2HDM. It is important to see the significant extension at the high energy muon collider via the RR process over the LHC coverage in the heavy Higgs parameter space.

ZH Associated Production and HA Pair Production

The ZH associated production and HA pair production of Eq. ([\ref=eq:zh]) at tree level are mediated by an off-shell Z boson. The cross section for the ZH associated production is proportional to κ2Z. On the other hand, the HA pair production is proportional to 1 - κ2Z in generic 2HDM models. These two channels bear some complementarity with each other. To quantify our study, we assume 90% tagging efficiency for the visible Z decays in the ZH associated production. We also studied the leptonic Z boson decay mode, where requirement on lepton pT, angle and separation are imposed as described in Table [\ref=tab:MuC]. For simplicity, we take both the CP-even and CP-odd heavy Higgs bosons to have the same mass.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:ZHHA] we show the event contours with 10 events (solid) and 50 events (dashed) for both ZH and HA channels in the mH,A-κZ plane. As expected, once crossing the kinematical threshold, the HA channel would be sensitive to a large range of κZ value. For instance, even for κ  ~  0.97, one still have 6% of the full cross section which leads to about 15 events. The kinematically favored channel ZH associated production is more sensitive than the HA pair production, expending to a larger mH region, as long as κZ > 0.1. A higher energy collider would extend the mass coverage to the multiple TeV kinematical limit, with a proportionally larger κZ value as seen in the figures.

Comparison of Different Modes

Kinematically, the RR process and the ZH associated production have quite different threshold behavior due to the massless nature of the photon. The closer the Higgs boson mass is to the energy threshold, the more effective the RR channel would be with respect to the ZH associated production. Well above the threshold on the other hand, these two processes scale with the energy in the same way as 1 / s. Dynamically, the RR process is only dependent on κμ, while both ZH associated production and HA pair production mainly depend on κZ. These two parameters are essentially independent of each other, characterizing the muon Yukawa coupling and the Higgs-gauge coupling, respectively.

It would be nevertheless informative to put side-by-side the reach of the two theory parameters via these two processes. Our results are summarized in Fig. [\ref=fig:kappas], where we choose a 3 ~   TeV muon collider to illustrate this comparison in the parameter plane κμ-κZ. The shaded regions labeled by different values of the heavy Higgs mass show the higher signal rate from the RR process than both the ZH associated production and HA pair production. The nearly flat region for 1.4 TeV H and A represents the good sensitivity from HA pair production in the low κZ region. As expected, the RR process is more sensitive for a heavier Higgs boson near the energy threshold, which would be especially important in the decoupling regime for ZH / HA processes. At higher (lower) energies, the mass reach scales up (down), but with a lower (higher) luminosity need scaled by 1 / s.

Only after specifying the underlying theory for the heavy Higgs bosons, and requiring the lighter Higgs boson in agreement with the current LHC measurement, these two parameters could be constrained in a correlated manner, subject to the experimental accuracy. The allowed κZ region is tightly constrained by the currently observed SM-like Higgs boson. We reproduce the allowed parameter regions from Ref. [\cite=Barger:2013ofa] for four types of 2HDM with current LHC data (solid) and projection after LHC-300 ~ fb- 1 (dashed). This illustrates that the RR processes is very much favored in 2HDM models, where the lighter SM-like Higgs boson carries most of the couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons.

Direct Measurement of Higgs Invisible Branching Fraction

The heavy Higgs boson could have deep connection with the dark matter sector, and have a sizable decay branching fraction to invisible particles [\cite=Birkedal:2006fz] [\cite=MarchRussell:2008yu] [\cite=Baer:2011ab] [\cite=Han:2013gba] [\cite=Han:2014nba]. We consider the signal of the Heavy Higgs thus rendered invisible in the context of the RR heavy Higgs production. The signal events contain a clean mono-chromatic photon that reconstructs the heavy Higgs mass without other particle activities.

The t-channel W boson exchange with ISR is the leading background (μ+μ-  →  ννγ), with its cross section as large as 2.6 pb. With this background included, we show the 3σ sensitivity to probe the invisible modes in Fig. [\ref=fig:invbr]. We exhibit the results for a series of κμ values (20, 30, 50) and Higgs widths (1, 10, 100 GeV) at the 3 TeV muon collider described in Table [\ref=tab:MuC]. The choice of bin sizes is to optimize the signal background ratio for κμ = 10 at steps of 1 GeV.

We see that without knowing the heavy Higgs boson mass, one still gains some sensitivity for its invisible width. Once the mass is known from the RR process described in Sec. [\ref=sec:RR] or from other means, the invisible width can be probed by tuning the beam close to the resonance. The invisible and undetectable width can also be mapped out indirectly with a dedicated beam scan as well, similar to the muon collider Higgs factory [\cite=Han:2012rb] [\cite=Conway:2013lca] [\cite=Alexahin:2013ojp].

Conclusions

We studied the signature and sensitivity for heavy Higgs boson signals from three production modes at a high energy muon collider. Compared to the s-channel resonance at [formula], these different production mechanisms do not rely on a priori knowledge of the Higgs boson mass, and thus avoid the broad scanning procedure. We find that radiative return (RR) is of particular interest. This signal (γH) is characterized by a mono-chromatic photon that yields a reconstructed recoil mass peak at the heavy Higgs boson mass. We performed numerical simulations for this signal and its SM backgrounds and showed the coupling-mass parameter space κμ-m (SUSY equivalent of tan β - MA) covered by such search at a high energy muon collider to be substantially extended over the LHC expectation with the direct observation of the heavy Higgs boson. Comparing with other modes of ZH and HA production at a lepton collider, the RR process is advantageous, especially for the "decoupled" scenarios in many 2HDM-like models. We further discussed its potential for measuring the invisible decays of the heavy Higgs boson and found some sensitivity especially for larger values of κμ. The RR process could certainly provide us an interesting option comparing to traditional scanning procedure for heavy Higgs boson discovery at a high energy muon collider.

Because of the lepton universality for gauge interactions, the processes μ+μ-  →  ZH, HA would be the same as those in e+e- collisions at the same c.m. energy since the contributions to both processes are overwhelmingly from the s-channel Z-exchange. Thus the advantage of the RR process (γH) would also apply when compared with a high energy e+e- collider, where the RR process is essentially absent.
