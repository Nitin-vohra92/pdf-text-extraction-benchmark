Introduction

Any function f analytic in a neighborhood of the origin can be uniquely written as

[formula]

where [formula] are analytic at the origin. Furthermore, the maps

[formula]

satisfy, under appropriate hypothesis, the Cuntz relations (see also [\eqref=explicit]). See for instance [\cite=MR3050315], where applications to wavelets are given. In the present paper, we extend these methods, and we derive new and explicit formulas for solutions to a class of multi-point interpolation problems; not amenable to tools from earlier investigations. Following common use, by “Cuntz relations” we refer here to a symbolic representation of a finite set (say N) of isometries having orthogonal ranges which add up to the identity (operator). When N is fixed the notation ON is often used. By a representation of ON in a fixed Hilbert space, we mean a realization of the N-Cuntz relations in a Hilbert space. Here we will be applying this to specific Hilbert spaces of analytic functions which are dictated by our multi-point interpolation setting. In general it is known that the problem of finding representations of ON is subtle. (The literature on representations of ON is vast.) For example, no complete classification of these representations is known, but nonetheless, specific representations can be found, and they are known to play a key role in several areas of mathematics and its applications; e.g., to multi-variable operator theory, and in applications to the study of multi-frequency bands; see the cited references below. Realizations as in [\eqref=decomp1] then results from representations of ON; the particulars of these representations are then encoded in the operators from [\eqref=iowa-city-180215]. Readers not familiar with ON and its representations are referred to [\cite=BrJo02a] [\cite=MR1284951] [\cite=MR2254502] [\cite=MR2097020], and to Remark [\ref=rk35] below.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we replace zN by an arbitrary polynomial p(z), and prove a counterpart of the decomposition [\eqref=decomp1], see Theorem [\ref=fbdthm]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In sections 3 -4, we discuss uniqueness of solutions, and (motivated by applications from systems theory) we extend our result in three ways, first to that of Banach space valued functions (Theorem [\ref=vvf]) and then we specialize to the case rational functions (Theorem [\ref=realrat]). Thirdly we study multipoint interpolation when derivatives are specified. In section 5, we give an application to positive definite kernels.

More precisely, a first application of Theorem [\ref=fbdthm] is in giving a new realization formula for rational functions. To explain the result, recall that a matrix-valued rational function W analytic at the origin can always be written in the form

[formula]

where D = W(0) and A,B,C are matrices of appropriate sizes. Such an expression is called a state space realization, and plays an important role in linear system theory and related topics; see for instance [\cite=bgr] and [\cite=MR2663312] for more information. We here prove that a rational function analytic at the points [formula] can always be written in the form

[formula]

where p(z) is a polynomial vanishing at the points [formula] and of degree N  ≥  n, and

[formula]

and α,β,γ are matrices of appropriate sizes. Finally we give an application to decompositions of positive definite kernels and the Cuntz relations.

The multipoint interpolation problem, which in the case where p has simple zeros [formula] consists in finding all functions f(z) analytic in a simply connected set (depending on f) containing the points [formula] and such that

[formula]

This can be equivalently written as

[formula]

Namely the points [formula] lie on a hyper-plane, so roughly speaking, the points [formula] lie on some manifold.

This type of problem seems to have been virtually neglected in the litterature. In [\cite=MR99h:47021] the case of two points was considered in the setting of the Hardy space of the open unit disk. The method there consisted in finding an involutive self-map of the open unit disk mapping one of the points to the second one, and thus reducing the given two-point interpolation problem to a one-point interpolation problem with an added symmetry. This method cannot be extended to more than two points, but in special cases. In [\cite=ajlm1] we considered the interpolation condition [\eqref=cons1] in the Hardy space. Connections with the Cuntz relations played a key role in the arguments.

A decomposition of analytic functions

We set

[formula]

and recall that Z(z) is given by [\eqref=Zz].

Choose n simple closed counterclockwise oriented contours [formula] with the following properties:

The function f(z) is analytic on each contour γj and in the simply connected domain Dj encircled by γj.

For [formula] the domain Dj contains the point wj.

The domains [formula] are pairwise disjoint.

Denote

[formula]

Since all the zeros of p(z) are contained in D, ρ > 0 and, by the maximum modulus principle, p- 1(Ω0)  ⊂  D, where Ω0 is the open disk of radius ρ centered at the origin. Furthermore, for z∈p- 1(Ω0) it holds that

[formula]

where Q(s) is a [formula]-valued polynomial, such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

is a [formula]-valued function, analytic in Ω0.

We first consider the case of a polynomial. For z near the origin we have

[formula]

Note that [formula] is the residue of the rational function [formula] at the point wj. For u large enough the difference of the degrees of the denominator and the numerator of this rational function is at least two, and so the sum of its residues is equal to 0 (the so-called exactity relation; see [\cite=freitag2] and [\cite=CAPB]). Thus Fu = 0 for u large enough and we conclude by analytic continuation that F is a polynomial.

In the case of a rational function consider the partial fraction representation, which is the sum of a polynomial (which we just have treated) and of terms of the form [formula], where a is not a zero of p. We thus need to show that, for such a, a sum of the form

[formula]

is rational. Chose the contours [formula] such that no zeroes of the equation p(s) = p(a) lie inside or on them. Using the polynomial case, the result follows from writing

[formula]

for some complex numbers [formula] corresponding to the partial fraction expansion of the function [formula]:

[formula]

These are readily seen to be rational functions of z, and hence the function G above is rational.

A new realization of rational functions

Denote by V the generalized N  ×  N Vandermonde matrix

[formula]

and by Cw the linear operator

[formula]

By rearanging the rows the matrix V is readily seen to be invertible.

Since

[formula]

differentiate both sides of [\eqref=fbd] at wj to obtain

[formula]

Hence, in vector notation,

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the classical backward-shift operator. In particular, the function R0F provides a decomposition [\eqref=fbd] for the function R(p)0f. By induction, one may conclude that

[formula]

hence, in view of [\eqref=u2],

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=fbdthm] has an analogue in the setting of analytic functions with values in a Banach space B. In what follows, Bs denotes the product space

[formula]

and the tensor product of a matrix [formula] and a linear operator A∈L(B) is understood as the operator matrix

[formula]

Let φ∈B*. Then, according to Theorem [\ref=fbdthm] and Proposition [\ref=pn31], the function [formula] admits a unique decomposition [\eqref=u1] provided by the [formula]-valued function

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since Fφ(z) is analytic in an open disk

[formula]

where ρ is independent of φ, the uniform boundedness principle implies that the BN-valued function

[formula]

is also analytic in Ω0, and [\eqref=fbd2] follows from

[formula]

The preceding analysis leads to a new kind of realization for rational functions.

Write

[formula]

where [formula] are constants. Then the operator R(p)0 defined in [\eqref=u3] can be written as

[formula]

Since f(z) is a rational function, the space

[formula]

is finite-dimensional. Choose a basis of this finite-dimensional space and let A,B,C be matrices representing the operators respectively. Then

[formula]

We will call the realization [\eqref=newreal] minimal if the size of the matrix A is minimal (for more on this notion, and equivalent characterizations, see for instance [\cite=bgk1]). As a consequence of the uniqueness of the decomposition we also have:

It suffices to notice that the uniqueness of the decomposition [\eqref=fbd] reduces the problem to the uniqueness of the minimality of the function C(I - λA)- 1B with [formula].

Indeed, on the one hand,

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

Proving the resolvent identity amounts to showing that:

[formula]

Taking into account the equality

[formula]

we have

[formula]

[\eqref=tyui] follows.

We finally note that, at least in spirit, we used the theory of linear system in this section. See for instance [\cite=MR0255260] [\cite=MR2663312] [\cite=MR2002b:47144] for more on this theory. In the sequel we resort to the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The reader may find the following references helpful: [\cite=saitoh] [\cite=meschkowski] [\cite=MR2002b:47144] [\cite=MBM+14] [\cite=NZ13] [\cite=FM13] [\cite=Wu13] [\cite=Mou12]

Linear combination interpolation

In [\cite=ajlm1] we introduced a general problem of linear combination interpolation, and solved it in the setting of the Hardy space. Here, the preceding analysis enables us to solve a linear combination interpolation problem in the setting of functions analytic in the neighborhoods of given preassigned points. The idea is to use the decomposition [\eqref=u1] and to reduce the interpolation condition [\eqref=newinter] to a unique interpolation condition for a vector-valued analytic function. Let

[formula]

Then [\eqref=newinter] can be re-written as

[formula]

In view of Propositions [\ref=pn31], this last condition is equivalent to

[formula]

which is a basic interpolation problem whose solution is given by

[formula]

where G(z) is an arbitrary [formula]-valued function analytic in a neighborhood of the origin. Thus the solutions f are given by

[formula]

Furthermore, we obtain all the rational solutions of the interpolation when G(z) is chosen rational.

Representation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces

Here we focus on the case when f(z) belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H(K) of analytic functions.

Write K(z,w) = C(z)C(w)*, where [formula] is the point evaluation functional:

[formula]

Then C(z) is a [formula]-valued function, analytic in Ω and, by Theorem [\ref=vvf], there exists a neighborhood Ω0 of the origin, such that p- 1(Ω0)  ⊂  Ω and

[formula]

where E(z) is a [formula]-valued function, analytic in Ω0. Now set

[formula]

to compete the proof.

Consider a linear relation in H(K)  ×  H(L) spanned by

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and since [formula] is dense in H(K), the above relation is the graph of an isometry [formula] The adjoint of T is the operator S. In view of Corollary [\ref=refmist], S is injective and hence unitary.
