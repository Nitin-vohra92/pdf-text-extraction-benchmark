Introduction

In 2006, the BaBar collaboration observed the D*sJ(2860) meson with the mass (2856.6  ±  1.5  ±  5.0)   and the width (48  ±  7  ±  10)   in decays to the final states D0K+ and D+K0S [\cite=BaBar2006]. There have been several possible assignments. Beveren and Rupp assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the first radial excitation of the D*s0(2317) based on a coupled-channel model [\cite=Beveren2006]. Colangelo, Fazio and Nicotri assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the 13D3 cs̄ state using the heavy meson effective theory [\cite=Colangelo0607]. Close et al assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the 23P0 state in a constituent quark model with novel spin-dependent interactions [\cite=Close2007]. Zhang et al assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the 23P0 or 13D3 state based on the [formula] model [\cite=Zhang2007]; Li, Ma and Liu share the same interpretation based on the Regge phenomenology [\cite=Li2007]. However, Ebert, Faustov and Galkin observe that the D*sJ(2860) does not fit well to the Regge trajectory D*s(2112), D*s2(2573), D*sJ(2860), [formula] [\cite=EFG]. Later, Li and Ma assign the D*s1(2700) to be the 13D1 - 23S1 mixing state and the D*sJ(2860) to be its orthogonal partner, or the D*sJ(2860) to be the 13D3 state based on the [formula] model [\cite=Li0911]. Zhong and Zhao assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the 13D3 state with some 13D2 - 11D2 mixing component using the chiral quark model, i.e. they assume that the D*sJ(2860) arises from two overlapping resonances [\cite=Zhong2008] [\cite=Zhong2010]. Vijande, Valcarce and Fernandez assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the cs̄ - cns̄n̄ mixing state [\cite=Vijande2009]. Chen, Wang and Zhang assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the 13D3 state based on a semi-classic flux tube model [\cite=Chen2009]. Badalian and Bakker assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the 13D3 state based on the QCD string model [\cite=Badalian2011]. Guo and Meissner take the D*sJ(2860) as the dynamically generated D1(2420)K bound state [\cite=FKGuo].

In 2009, the BaBar collaboration confirmed the D*sJ(2860) in the D*K channel, and measured the ratio R among the branching fractions [\cite=BaBar2009],

[formula]

The observation of the decays D*sJ(2860)  →  D*K rules out the JP = 0+ assignment [\cite=Beveren2006] [\cite=Close2007] [\cite=Zhang2007] [\cite=Li2007]. On the other hand, if we take the D*sJ(2860) as the 13D3 state, Colangelo, Fazio and Nicotri obtain the value R = 0.39 based on the heavy meson effective theory [\cite=Colangelo0607], while in the [formula] model, Zhang et al obtain the value 0.59 [\cite=Zhang2007], Li and Ma obtain the value 0.75 [\cite=Li0911], Song et al obtain the value 0.55  ~  0.80 [\cite=Song2014]. Recently, Godfrey and Jardine obtain the value 0.43 based on the relativized quark model combined with the pseudoscalar emission decay model [\cite=Godfrey2013]. The theoretical values differ from the experimental value greatly.

Recently, the LHCb collaboration observed a structure at 2.86   with significance of more than 10 standard deviations in the [formula] mass spectrum in the Dalitz plot analysis of the decays [formula], the structure contains both spin-1 and spin-3 components (i.e. the D*  -s1(2860) and the D*  -s3(2860), respectively), which supports an interpretation of these states being the JP = 1- and 3- members of the 1D family [\cite=LHCb7574] [\cite=LHCb7712]. The measured masses and widths are MD*s3 = (2860.5  ±  2.6  ±  2.5  ±  6.0)  , MD*s1 = (2859  ±  12  ±  6  ±  23)  , ΓD*s3 = (53  ±  7  ±  4  ±  6)  , and ΓD*s1 = (159  ±  23  ±  27  ±  72)  , respectively. Furthermore, the LHCb collaboration obtained the conclusion that the D*sJ(2860) observed by the BaBar collaboration in the inclusive [formula] production and by the LHCb collaboration in the [formula] processes consists of at least these two resonances [\cite=BaBar2009] [\cite=LHCb1207].

According to the predictions of the potential models [\cite=EFG] [\cite=GI] [\cite=PE], see Table 1, the masses of the 1D cs̄ states is about 2.9  . It is reasonable to assign the D*s1(2860) and D*s3(2860) to be the [formula] and [formula] cs̄ states, respectively [\cite=LHCb7574] [\cite=LHCb7712]. However, the theoretical values R differ from the experimental value greatly in the case of the D*s3(2860) or the [formula] assignment of the D*sJ(2860). In Ref.[\cite=Colangelo0607], Colangelo, Fazio and Nicotri take the leading order heavy meson effective Lagrangian. The two-body strong decays D*s3(2860)  →  D*K, DK take place through the relative F-wave, the final K mesons have the three momenta pK = 584   and 705  , respectively. The decay widths

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] in the decays to the final states D*K and DK, respectively. Small difference in pK can lead to large difference in p7K, so we have to take into account the heavy quark symmetry breaking corrections and chiral symmetry breaking corrections so as to make robust predictions.

In this article, we take into account the chiral symmetry-breaking corrections, and study the two-body strong decays of the D*s1(2860) and D*s3(2860) with the heavy meson effective Lagrangian, and try to reproduce the experimental value R = 1.10  ±  0.15  ±  0.19 by assigning the D*sJ(2860) to be the D*s1(2860) and the D*s3(2860), respectively. Recently, Wu and Huang study the strong decays of the D*s0(2317) and [formula] by including the chiral symmetry breaking corrections [\cite=WuHuang]. The heavy meson effective theory have been applied to identify the charmed mesons and bottom mesons [\cite=Colangelo0607] [\cite=Wang1009] [\cite=Wang1308] [\cite=Colangelo1207] [\cite=Colangelo0511], and to calculate the radiative, vector-meson, two-pion decays of the heavy quarkonium states [\cite=HMET-RV].

The article is arranged as follows: we derive the strong decay widths of the charmed mesons D*s1(2860) and D*s3(2860) with the heavy meson effective theory in Sect.2; in Sect.3, we present the numerical results and discussions; and Sect.4 is reserved for our conclusions.

The strong decays with the heavy meson effective theory

In the heavy quark limit, the heavy-light mesons [formula] can be classified in doublets according to the total angular momentum of the light antiquark [formula], [formula], where the [formula] and [formula] are the spin and orbital angular momentum of the light antiquark, respectively [\cite=RevWise]. In this article, the revelent doublets are the L = 0 (S-wave) doublet (P,P*) with [formula], and the L = 2 (D-wave) doublets (P*1,P2) and (P2,P  *3) with [formula] and [formula], respectively. In the heavy meson effective theory, those doublets can be described by the effective super-fields Ha, Xa and Ya, respectively [\cite=Falk1992],

[formula]

where the heavy meson fields P( * ) contain a factor [formula] and have dimension of mass [formula]. The super-fields Ha contain the [formula]-wave mesons (P,P*); Xa, Ya contain the [formula]-wave mesons (P*1,P2), (P2,P  *3), respectively.

The light pseudoscalar mesons are described by the fields [formula], where

[formula]

and the decay constant fπ = 130  .

At the leading order approximation, the heavy meson chiral Lagrangians LX and LY for the strong decays to the light pseudoscalar mesons can be written as:

[formula]

where

[formula]

the hadronic coupling constants gX, gY and Y are parameters and can be fitted to the experimental data [\cite=HL] [\cite=PRT1997], Λ is the chiral symmetry breaking scale and chosen as Λ  =  1   [\cite=Colangelo0511].

We construct the chiral symmetry breaking Lagrangians LχX and LχY according to Refs.[\cite=Heavy-Chiral] [\cite=Heavy-Chiral-2],

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

mq  =  diag(mu,md,ms), [formula], vμ = (1,0,0,0), the hadronic coupling constants kjX / Y, jY, 5X, 5X with j = 1,5 can be fitted to the experimental data. The flavor and spin violation corrections of the order O(1 / mQ) are neglected, as there are too many unknown couplings to be determined, we expect that the corrections are not as large as the chiral symmetry breaking corrections. At the hadronic level, the 1 / mQ corrections can be crudely estimated to be of the order pK / MD*sJ  ≈  0.20 - 0.25 or [formula] with [formula]. We can also take into account the 1 / mQ corrections consistently by resorting to the covariant heavy meson chiral theory [\cite=LSGeng], however, we have no experimental data or lattice QCD data to fit the unknown hadronic constants, and it is beyond the present work.

From the heavy meson chiral Lagrangians LX, LY, LχX and LχY, we can obtain the decay widths Γ of the strong decays to the light pseudoscalar mesons,

In those decays, the energy release [formula] is rather large, the chiral expansion does not converge very quickly, the next-to-leading order chiral corrections maybe manifest themselves.

Numerical Results and Discussions

The input parameters are taken as MK+ = 493.677  , MK0 = 497.614  , Mη = 547.862  , MD+ = 1869.5  , MD0 = 1864.91  , MD+s = 1969  , MD*  + = 2010.29  , MD* 0 = 2006.99  , MD*  +s = 2112.3   from the Particle Data Group [\cite=PDG].

We redefine the hadronic coupling constants Y = gY  +  Y, [formula], j = 1 - 5, and write down the decay widths of the D*s3(2860) explicitly from Eqs.(13-14).

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In this article, we neglect the one-loop chiral corrections, which are estimated to be of the order [formula]. In the case of the hadronic coupling constants g and h in the heavy meson chiral theory, the one-loop chiral corrections are less than 10% [\cite=Heavy-Chiral-2], which are consistent with the crude estimation.

We define the ratios R0 +, R+ 0, Rs among the decay widths,

[formula]

The ratios R0 +, R+ 0, Rs are independent on the hadronic coupling constants Y, k̄1Y, k̄2Y, k̄3Y, k̄4Y, we can absorb the coupling constants k̄1Y, k̄2Y, k̄3Y, k̄4Y into the effective coupling Y or set k̄1Y  =  k̄2Y  =  k̄3Y  =  k̄4Y = 0.

Firstly, let us assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the D*s3(2860), then we can obtain the value,

[formula]

by setting the [formula] to be the experimental data, [formula] [\cite=BaBar2009]. On the other hand, if we retain only the leading order coupling constant Y, then [formula], which is consistent with the value 0.39 obtained by Colangelo, Fazio and Nicotri [\cite=Colangelo0607]. The value of the hadronic coupling constant k5Y  +  5Y in the chiral symmetry breaking Lagrangian is about [formula] of that of the hadronic coupling constant gY  +  Y in the leading-order Lagrangian according to the relation k̄5Y = (k5Y  +  5Y) / (gY  +  Y). However, taking into account such chiral symmetry breaking term can enlarge the ratio R about 2.8 times.

Then we write down the prediction of the ratio Rs,

[formula]

the value 0.18 in the bracket comes from the leading order heavy meson effective Lagrangian LY, i.e. only the Y is retained. The chiral symmetry breaking corrections are rather large, the present predictions can be confronted with the experimental data in the futures to study the chiral symmetry breaking corrections.

We can also define the ratios R0+ and [formula],

[formula]

which are sensitive to the chiral symmetry breaking corrections associate with k̄1Y. We can estimate the k̄1Y by confronting the ratios R0+ and [formula] with the experimental data in the future.

Now we assign the D*sJ(2860) to be the D*s1(2860) and study the strong decays of the D*s1(2860) as the 131 cs̄ state. Firstly, let us redefine the hadronic coupling constants k̄jX = kjX / gX, j = 1 - 4, k̄5X = (k5X  +  5X  +  5X) / gX, and write down the decay widths explicitly from Eqs.(10-11),

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then we define the ratio [formula],

[formula]

which is independent on the hadronic coupling constants gX, k̄1X, k̄2X, k̄3X, k̄4X. We can also absorb the coupling constants k̄1X, k̄2X, k̄3X, k̄4X into the effective coupling gX or set k̄1X  =  k̄2X  =  k̄3X  =  k̄4X = 0. By setting [formula] [\cite=BaBar2009], we can obtain the value,

[formula]

The value of the hadronic coupling constant k5X  +  5X  +  5X in the chiral symmetry breaking Lagrangian is as large as that of the hadronic coupling constant gX in the leading-order Lagrangian according to the relation k̄5X = (k5X  +  5X  +  5X) / gX. The dimensionless coupling constants k̄5X and k̄5Y are normalized in the same way, and k̄5X  ≫  k̄5Y, the convergent behavior is much better in the chiral expansion in case of assigning the D*sJ(2860) to be the D*s3(2860). The assignment of the D*sJ(2860) as the D*s1(2860) is not favored but not excluded, because a larger coupling constant k̄5X does not mean that the chiral expansion breaks down.

Those strong decays of the D*s1(2860) take place through the relative P-wave, the decay widths are proportional to p3f, while the strong decays of the D*s3(2860) take place through the relative F-wave, the decay widths are proportional to p7f. The decay widths of the D*s1(2860) are much insensitive to the pf compared to that of the D*s3(2860). At the present time, there is no experimental data to fit the hadronic coupling constants. In the leading order approximation, i.e. we neglect the chiral symmetry breaking corrections, the ratios [formula], [formula] and [formula] among the decay widths are

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where in the bracket we present the values from the recent studies based on the [formula] model [\cite=Song2014]. Also in the [formula] model, Zhang et al obtain the value [formula] [\cite=Zhang2007]. The present value [formula] differs greatly from that obtained in Ref.[\cite=Song2014], while it is compatible with that obtained in Ref.[\cite=Zhang2007]. In Ref.[\cite=Godfrey2013], Godfrey and Jardine obtain the value 0.34 based on the relativized quark model combined with the pseudoscalar emission decay model, which is larger than the present calculation. The present predictions can be confronted with the experimental data in the future to study the strong decays of the D*s1(2860).

In the leading order approximation, we obtain the values R = 0.39 and [formula] in the cases of assigning the D*sJ(2860) to be the D*s3(2860) and D*s1(2860) respectively, which differ from the experimental value 1.10  ±  0.15  ±  0.19 greatly [\cite=BaBar2009]. If the D*sJ(2860) observed by the BaBar collaboration in the inclusive [formula] production and by the LHCb collaboration in the [formula] processes consists of two resonances D*s1(2860) and D*s3(2860) [\cite=BaBar2009] [\cite=LHCb1207], we expect to obtain an even smaller ratio R in case of the chiral symmetry breaking corrections are small. On the other hand, if the D*sJ(2860) consists of at least four resonances D*s1(2860), D*s2(2860), [formula], D*s3(2860), the large ratio R = 1.10  ±  0.15  ±  0.19 is easy to account for, as the JP = 2- mesons D*s2(2860) and [formula] only decay to the final states D*K, see Eq.(9) and Eq.(15).

In the decays [formula], the ratio R21

[formula]

while in the decays [formula], the ratio R23

[formula]

According to the ratios R21 and R23, the 2- state in a special doublet, irrespective of the [formula] doublet and the [formula] doublet, has a much larger decay width to the final state 1-  +  Pj compared to its partner (the 1- state or the 3- state). The 2- states in the D*sJ(2860) can enhance the ratio R significantly and account for the large ratio R = 1.10  ±  0.15  ±  0.19 naturally. The ratios R21 and R23 are independent on the hadronic coupling constants and determined by the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry. We can confront the present predictions to the experimental data in the future to examine the nature of the D*sJ(2860) or identify the D*s2(2860) and [formula] states. Furthermore, the chiral symmetry breaking Lagrangians LχX and LχY have other phenomenological applications in the heavy-light meson systems, form example, we can study the strong decays of the D-wave Q mesons and calculate the scattering amplitudes of the S-wave and D-wave Q mesons.

Conclusion

In this article, we take the D*s3(2860) and D*s1(2860) as the 13D3 and 13D1 cs̄ states, respectively, study their strong decays with the heavy meson effective theory by including the chiral symmetry breaking corrections. We can reproduce the experimental value of the ratio R, [formula], with suitable hadronic coupling constants, the assignment of the D*sJ(2860) as the D*s3(2860) is favored. The chiral symmetry breaking corrections are large, we should take them into account. Furthermore, we obtain the analytical expressions of the decay widths, which can confronted with the experimental data in the future from the LHCb, CDF, D0 and KEK-B collaborations to fit the unknown coupling constants. The present predictions of the ratios among the decay widths can be used to study the decay properties of the D*s3(2860) and D*s1(2860) so as to identify them unambiguously. On the other hand, if the chiral symmetry breaking corrections are small, the large ratio R = 1.10  ±  0.15  ±  0.19 requires that the D*sJ(2860) consists of at least four resonances D*s1(2860), D*s2(2860), [formula], D*s3(2860).
