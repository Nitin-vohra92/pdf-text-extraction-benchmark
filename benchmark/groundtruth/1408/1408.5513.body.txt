Resolvability in Hypergraphs

Introduction

A hypergraph H is a pair (V(H),E(H)), where V(H) is a finite set of vertices and E(H) is a finite family of non-empty subsets of V(H), called hyperedges, with [formula]. |V(H)| and |E(H)| are called the order and the size of H, denoted by m and k, respectively. A subhypergraph K of a hypergraph H is a hypergraph with vertex set V(K)  ⊆  V(H) and edge set E(K)  ⊆  E(H). The rank of H, denoted by rank(H), is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge in E(H). H is linear if for distinct hyperedges Ei,Ej∈E(H), [formula], so for a linear hypergraph there may be no repeated hyperedges of cardinality greater than one. A hypergraph H with no hyperedge is a subset of any other is called Sperner.

A vertex v∈V(H) is incident with a hyperedge E of H if v∈E. If v is incident with exactly n hyperedges, then we say that the degree of v is n; if all the vertices v∈V(H) have degree n, then H is n-regular. Similarly, if there are exactly n vertices incident with a hyperedge E, then we say that the size of E is n; if all the hyperedges E∈E(H) have size n, then H is n-uniform. A graph is simply a 2-uniform hypergraph. A hyperedge E of H is called a pendant hyperedge if for Ei,Ej∈E(H), [formula] and [formula] implies [formula]. A path from a vertex v to another vertex u, in a hypergraph, is a finite sequence of the form v,E1,w1,E2,w2,...,El - 1,wl - 1,El,u, having length l such that [formula] and u∈El. A hypergraph H is called connected if there is a path between any two vertices of H. All hypergraphs considered in this paper are connected Sperener hypergraphs.

The primal graph, prim(H), of a hypergraph H is a graph with vertex set V(H) and vertices x and y of prim(H) are adjacent if and only if x and y are contained in a hyperedge. The middle graph, M(H), of H is a subgraph of prim(H) formed by deleting all loops and parallel edges. The dual of [formula], denoted by H*, is the hypergraph whose vertices are [formula] corresponding to the hyperedges of H and with hyperedges Vi  =  {ej : vi∈Ej  H}, where [formula]. In other words, the dual H* swaps the vertices and hyperedges of H.

A hypergraph H is said to be a hyperstar if [formula], for any Ei,Ej∈E(H). We will call C, the center of the hyperstar. If there exist a sequence of hyperedges [formula] in a hypergraph H, then H is said to be (1) a hyperpath if [formula] if and only if |i - j|  =  1; (2) a hypercycle if, [formula] if and only if |i - j|  =  1 (mod k). A connected hypergraph H with no hypercycle is called a hypertree. A subhypertree of a hypertree H with edge set, say [formula], is called a branch of H if Ep1 (say) is the only hyperedge such that, for [formula], [formula] and [formula] implies [formula]. The hyperedge Ep1 is called the joint of the branch.

The distance between any two vertices v and u of H, d(v,u), is the length of a shortest path between them and d(v,u) = 0 if and only if v = u. The eccentricity of a vertex v of H, denoted by ecc(v), is the number [formula]. The diameter of H is the number [formula], and is denoted by diam(H). Two vertices u and v of H are said to be diametral vertices if d(u,v)  =  diam(H). The representation r(v|W) of a vertex v with respect to an ordered set W = {w1,w2,...,wq}  ⊆  V(H) is a q-tuple [formula] The set W is called a resolving set for a hypergraph H if r(v|W)  ≠  r(u|W) for any two different vertices v,u∈V(H). A resolving set with minimum cardinality is called a basis for H and that minimum cardinality is called the metric dimension of H, denoted by dim(H).

The metric dimension was first studied by Slater [\cite=slater] and independently by Harary and Melter [\cite=rp3]. It is a parameter that has appeared in various application, as diverse as combinatorial optimization, pharmaceutical chemistry, robot navigation and sonar. In recent years, a considerable literature has been developed (see [\cite=rp2] [\cite=ftr2] [\cite=7] [\cite=ftr1] [\cite=jav] [\cite=8] [\cite=salman]). The problem of determining whether dim(H)  <  M (M > 0) is an NP-complete problem [\cite=5] [\cite=8].

To determine whether a given set W  ⊆  V(H) is a resolving set for H, W needs only to be verified for the vertices in [formula] since every vertex w∈W is the only vertex of H whose distance from w is 0.

Possibly to gain insight into the metric dimension, Chartrand et al. introduced the notion of a resolving partition and partition dimension [\cite=rp1] [\cite=cha2]. To define the partition dimension, the distance d(v,S) between a vertex v in H and S  ⊆  V(H) is defined as [formula] Let [formula] be an ordered t-partition of V(H) and v be any vertex of H. Then the representation r(v|Π) of v with respect Π is a t-tuple [formula] The partition Π is called a resolving partition for a hypergraph if r(v|Π)  ≠  r(u|Π) for any two distinct vertices v,u∈V(H). The partition dimension of a hypergraph H is the cardinality of a minimum resolving partition, denoted by pd(H).

From the definition of a resolving partition, it can be observed that the property of a given partition Π of a hypergraph H to be a resolving partition of H can be verified by investigating the pairs of vertices in the same class. Indeed, d(x,Si) = 0 for every vertex x∈Si but d(x,Sj)  ≠  0 with j  ≠  i. It follows that x∈Si and y∈Sj are resolved either by Si or Sj for every i  ≠  j.

In this paper, we study the metric and partition dimension of hypergraphs. We give the sharp lower bounds for the metric and partition dimension of graphs. Also, we study the metric dimension of some well-known families of hypergraphs such as hyperpaths, hypertrees and n-uniform linear hypercycles. Further, we study the partition dimension of all the n-uniform linear hypercycles. We also characterize all the n-uniform (for all n  ≥  2 and n  ≠  3 when k is even) linear hypergraphs with partition dimension n. Moreover, all the hypergraphs with metric dimension 1 and partition dimension 2 are characterized.

Metric Dimension of Hypergraphs

If we denote all the vertices of degree d in [formula] by the class C(i1,i2,...,id), then the collection of all such classes gives a partition of V(H). We denote n(i1,i2,...,id) = |C(i1,i2,...,id)| - 1 when [formula], otherwise take n(i1,i2,...,id) = 0. Thus, we have the following straightforward proposition:

For any two distinct vertices u,v∈C(i1,i2,...,id) , we have d(u,w) = d(v,w) for any [formula]

Thus, we have the following lemma related to the resolving set for H:

If u,v∈C(i1,i2,...,id) and W  ⊆  V(H) resolves H, then at least one of u and v is in W. Moreover, if u∈W and [formula], then [formula] also resolves H.

The lower bound for the metric dimension of hypergraphs is given in the following result:

For any hypergraph H with k hyperedges,

[formula]

It follows from the fact that if there are |C(i1,i2,...,id)| number of vertices of degree d in [formula] then, by Lemma [\ref=l1], at least n(i1,i2,...,id) vertices should belong to any basis W.

By Proposition [\ref=p1], it is clear that, in order to obtain a basis set of any hypergraph H, we need to work with only one vertex, say vi1,i2,...,id∈C(i1,i2,...,id) from each class C(i1,i2,...,id), if [formula] we call such a vertex, representative vertex of C(i1,i2,...,id). We denote the set of all representative vertices in a hypergraph H by R(H) and hence we always have [formula] for any basis set W.

Now, we discuss those hypergraphs for which the equality holds in Proposition [\ref=p1].

For any hypergraph H with k hyperedges, if n(i)  ≠  0 for all Ei∈E(H), then [formula] Moreover, there are [formula] basis for H.

Consider [formula] we have to show that W is a basis for H. Take any two different vertices v,v'∈R(H), since both vertices are representative of different classes and hence there exists a hyperedge Ej such that v'∈Ej but [formula] Since n(j)  ≠  0 so there exists a vertex of degree one say, wj∈V(H) such that [formula]. Clearly d(v',wj) = 1 and d(v,wj)  ≠  1, hence W is a basis for H. Further, by Lemma [\ref=l1], there are [formula] such W.

For all n  ≥  4, if H is an n-uniform linear hypergraph with k hyperedges, then n(i,i + 1)  =  0 for all i. Thus, we have the following corollary:

For n  ≥  4, let H be an n-uniform linear hypergraph with k hyperedges. If n(i)  ≠  0 for all Ei∈E(H), then [formula].

We give two examples which show that the condition in Theorem [\ref=t1] cannot be relaxed generally.

Let H be a hypergraph with vertex set V(H) = {v1,v2,v3,v4} and edge set [formula] Clearly, n(2) = 0 so H does not satisfy the condition of Theorem [\ref=t1]. Without loss of generality, we can take the set of representative vertices R(H) = {v1,v3,v4} and hence W = {v2}. But W is not a resolving set for H, since r(v1|W) = r(v3|W). In fact, dim(H) = 2 > 1.

Let H be a hypergraph with vertex set V(H) = {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6} and edge set [formula] Clearly, n(i)  =  0 for all i  =  1,2,3 and n(1,2) = n(2,3)  =  n(3,1)  ≠  0. Without loss of generality, we can take the set of representative vertices R(H) = {v1,v3,v5} and hence W = {v2,v4,v6}. But W is not a resolving set for H, since r(v1|W) = r(v3|W)  =  r(v5|W). In fact, dim(H) = 5 > 3.

However, the condition in Theorem [\ref=t1] can be reduced in some special cases as shown in the following results.

Let H be a hyperpath with k hyperedges, say [formula] in a canonical way. Then [formula] if both n(1) and n(k) are non-zero.

Since n(1)  ≠  0 so there exists a vertex of degree one, say [formula], similarly there exists a vertex of degree one, say [formula] In order to prove the theorem, we only have to show that the representative vertices are resolved by the set [formula] which follows from the fact that, for any 1  ≤  j  ≤  k, we have [formula] and for any 1  ≤  j < k - 1, we have [formula]

Let H be a hypertree with k hyperedges and [formula] are the pendant hyperedges. Then [formula] if n(ps)  ≠  0 for all [formula]

Consider [formula] similarly as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=t1], again we have to show that W is a basis for H. Take any two different vertices v,v'∈R(H), then both vertices are representative of two different classes and hence there exists a hyperedge Ej such that v'∈Ej but [formula] Now, consider a hyperpath contained in the hypertree H which starts and ends at the pendant hyperedges and contains both v and Ej. By using the proof of Theorem [\ref=l3], it can be seen that the vertices v and v' has different representations with respect to W, which proves the theorem.

An n-uniform linear hyperstar (n  ≥  3) is a special case of the hypertree in which n(i)  ≠  0 for all Ei∈E(H), so we have the following corollary:

For n  ≥  3, let H be an n-uniform linear hyperstar with k (  ≥  3) hyperedges. Then dim(H) = k(n - 2).

Consider an n-uniform linear hypercycle Ck,n with k hyperedges. When n  ≥  4, then n(i)  ≠  0 for all Ei∈E(Ck,n) so, by Corollary [\ref=c11], dim(Ck,n)  =  k(n - 3).

For the case n = 3, we have n(i)  =  0 for all Ei∈E(H), hence the lower bound given in Proposition [\ref=p1] is zero and every vertex in Ck,3 is the representative vertex. We discuss this case in the following result:

Let Ck,3 be a 3-uniform linear hypercycle with k hyperedges. Then [formula] = 2 and for all k  ≥  4,

[formula]

In Ck,3, each vj∈Ej represents a vertex of degree one and [formula] with vk,k + 1 = vk,1. Clearly, dim(Ck,3) > 1 for any k.

If k is even, then we take [formula]. For [formula] we have [formula] and for [formula] Now, if [formula] then [formula] and [formula] with [formula], [formula] and [formula] It is easy to see that the representations of all the vertices with respect to W are distinct, hence W forms a basis for Ck,3 and dim(Ck,3) = 2.

For the special case when k = 3, the set W = {v1,v2} forms a basis for C3,3. Hence dim(C3,3) = 2.

If k > 3 is odd, then we first show that dim(Ck,3) > 2. Suppose on contrary that dim(Ck,3)  =  2 and let W is a basis of Ck,3. Let us call the vertex vi,i + 1 of Ck,3, the common vertex. We have the following three possibilities:

(1) W contains both common vertices. Without loss of generality, we suppose that one vertex is v1,2 and the second vertex is vj,j + 1 (2  ≤  j  ≤  k). Then r(vj + 1|W)  =  r(vj + 1,j + 2|W), for [formula]; r(v2|W)  =  r(vk,1|W), for [formula]; r(v1|W)  =  r(v2,3|W), for [formula] and r(vj|W)  =  r(vj - 1,j|W), for [formula], a contradiction.

(2) W contains one common vertex. Without loss of generality, we suppose that one vertex is v1,2 and the second vertex is vj (1  ≤  j  ≤  k). Then r(vj + 1|W)  =  r(vj + 1,j + 2|W), for [formula]; r(v1|W)  =  r(vk,1|W), for [formula]; r(v1|W)  =  r(v2|W), for [formula] and r(v2|W)  =  r(v2,3|W), for [formula], a contradiction.

(3) W contains no common vertex. Without loss of generality, we suppose that one vertex is v1 and the second vertex is vj (2  ≤  j  ≤  k). Then r(vj + 1|W)  =  r(vj + 1,j + 2|W), for [formula]; r(vj - 1|W)  =  r(vj + 1,j + 2|W), for [formula]; r(vj + 1|W)  =  r(vj - 2,j - 1|W), for [formula] and r(vj - 1|W)  =  r(vj - 2,j - 1|W), for [formula], a contradiction.

Now, we will show that dim(Ck,3)  ≤  3. Take [formula]. We note that, [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

One can see that all the vertices of [formula] have distinct representations. This implies that dim(Ck,3) = 3 when k  >  3 is odd.

Form the definition of the primal graph of a hypergraph H, we note that a path P is a shortest path between the vertices x and y in H if and only if P is a shortest path between x and y in the primal graph of H. Thus, we have the following straightforward result:

Let H be a hypergraph and prim(H) be the primal graph of H. Then dim(H)  =  dim(prim(H))  =  dim(M(H)).

The primal graph of the dual H* of a hypergraph H is not a simple graph, in this case, the middle graph of H* is a simple graph. We discuss the metric dimension of dual hypergraphs separately in the following result, which also help us to characterize all the hypergraphs with metric dimension one.

Let H* be the dual of a hypergraph H and M(H*) be the middle graph of H*. Then dim(H*)  =  dim(M(H*)).

By the definition of middle graph, for any two vertices u and v of H*, a path P is a shortest path between the vertices u and v in H* if and only if P is a shortest path between u and v in M(H*). Thus a set W  ⊆  V(H*) is a minimum resolving set for H* if and only if W is a minimum resolving set for M(H*).

The middle graph of H* is (1) a simple path Pm if and only if H is a hyperpath; (2) a simple cycle Cm if and only if H is a hypercycle. In [\cite=rp2], all the simple graphs with metric dimension 1 were characterized. It was shown that the metric dimension of a simple graph G is one if and only if G is a simple path Pm (m  ≥  1). Now, we characterize all the hypergraphs with the metric dimension 1. In fact, all these hypergraphs are the dual hypergraphs and have been characterized in the following consequence of Theorem [\ref=tt5].

Let H be a hypergraph and H* be the dual of H. Then dim(H*)  =  1 if and only if H is a hyperpath.

In [\cite=rp3], it was shown that the metric dimension of a simple cycle Cm (m  ≥  3) is two. Thus, we have the following corollary:

Let H be a hypercycle and H* be the dual of H. Then dim(H*)  =  2.

Partition Dimension of Hypergraphs

In this section, we study the partition dimension of hypergraphs. From Proposition [\ref=pro1], we have the following lemma:

Let Π be a resolving partition of V(H). If u,v∈C(i1,i2,...,id) then u and v belong to distinct classes of Π.

The following result gives the lower bound for the partition dimension of hypergraphs.

Let H be a hypergraph with k hyperedges. Then pd(H)  ≥  λ + 1, where [formula] in H.

Since [formula] in H, by Lemma [\ref=l4], we have at least λ disjoint classes [formula] of V(H). Since H is Sperner so there exists an edge E of H such that [formula]. Now, if [formula] is a minimum resolving partition of V(H) then there exist two vertices u and v in E such that u,v∈Si (say) with [formula], where 0 is at the ith place, a contradiction. Thus, pd(H)  ≥  λ + 1.

The lower bound given in Proposition [\ref=p2] is sharp for an n-uniform linear hyperpath.

In [\cite=cha2], it was shown that the partition dimension of a 2-uniform linear hypercycle (simple cycle) is three. The following result shows that the partition dimension of an n-uniform linear hypercycle is n + 1 except when the number of edges is even in 3-uniform linear hypercycle.

For n  ≥  2, let Ck,n be an n-uniform linear hypercycle with k  ≥  3 hyperedges. Then, for all n (  ≠  3), we have pd(Ck,n)  =  n + 1 and

[formula]

For n  =  2, a hypercycle Ck,2 is a simple cycle on m vertices and it was shown that the partition dimension of a simple cycle is 3 [\cite=cha2], so pd(Ck,2)  =  3.

For all n  ≥  3, we denote the vertices of Ck,n by vji, where j (1  ≤  j  ≤  k) represents the hyperedge number of Ck,n and i (1  ≤  i  ≤  n) represents the vertex number of the jth hyperedge. Each vji∈Ej, 2  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, represents a vertex of degree one and [formula] represents a vertex of degree 2 with vkn  =  v11.

For n  =  3 and k is even. Since pd(H)  ≤  dim(H) + 1 so, by Theorem [\ref=t3], we have pd(Ck,3)  ≤  3. Further, if we put all the vertices of Ck,3 into two classes S1 and S2, then they do not form a resolving partition Π of V(Ck,3) because it is easy to see that there exist two vertices u,v in a hyperedge such that u,v∈S1 (say) and r(u|Π)  =  (0,1) = r(v|Π). Thus pd(Ck,3)  =  3.

For n  =  3, k is odd, by Theorem [\ref=t3] and by using the result pd(H)  ≤  dim(H) + 1, we have pd(Ck,3)  ≤  4. For all n  ≥  4, let Π  =  {S1,S2,...,Sn + 1} be an (n + 1)-ordered partition of V(Ck,n). Where, for k  =  4, St  =  {vjt + 1 : 1  ≤  j  ≤  4}  1  ≤  t  ≤  n - 3, Sn - 2  =  {vjn - 1 : 1  ≤  j  ≤  3}, Sn - 1  =  {vj1 : 2  ≤  j  ≤  4}, Sn  =  {v4n - 1}, Sn + 1  =  {v11}; and for all k  ≥  3 and k  ≠  4, St  =  {v1t,vjt + 1 : 2  ≤  j  ≤  k}  1  ≤  t  ≤  n - 3, St  =  {v1t,vjt + 1 : 2  ≤  j  ≤  k - 2}  t = n - 2,n - 1, Sn  =  {v21} and Sn + 1  =  {vkn - 1}. Now, it is a routine exercise to check that Π is a resolving partition of V(Ck,n), which implies that dim(Ck,n)  ≤  n + 1.

Conversely, consider a hyperedge Ei of Ck,n. Note that [formula], by Lemma [\ref=l4], there are n - 2 classes [formula] which contains the vertices [formula], respectively. Since [formula], by Proposition [\ref=p2], there is at least one more class Sn - 1 which contains either vi1 or vin of Ei. Suppose that vi1∈Sn - 1. Now, if the nth vertex vin of Ei belongs to any of the classes [formula], say vin∈Sj, and if all these classes form a partition Π of V(Ck,n), then [formula], where 0 is at the jth place, from where we conclude that Π is not a resolving partition. Thus we need at least one more class Sn for vin. From this, we deduce that, to resolve all the vertices of a hyperedge E∈E(Ck,n), a resolving partition Π of V(Ck,n) needs to contain |E|  =  n classes. But then, there exist two vertices u∈Ei and v∈Ej (i  ≠  j) such that u,v∈Sl (say) with [formula], where 0 is at the lth place, a contradiction. Hence pd(Ck,n)  ≥  n + 1.

In [\cite=rp1], it was shown that a 2-uniform linear hyperpath (simple path) has partition dimension 2. Now, we generalize this result by proving that if H is an n-uniform linear hyperpath (n  ≥  2), then the partition dimension of H is n.

For n  ≥  2, let H be an n-uniform linear hypergraph with k hyperedges. Then, for a 3-uniform linear hyperpath H with even hyperedges, pd(H)  =  3 and for all other values of n, pd(H)  =  n if and only if H is a hyperpath.

Let H be an n-uniform linear hyperpath. Then it is a routine exercise to verify that a partition [formula] of V(H), where each Si, 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, contains the ith vertex of every hyperedge of H and Sn contains the nth vertex of the kth hyperedge, is a minimum resolving partition.

Conversely, suppose that [formula] be a minimum resolving partition of V(H) and H is an n-uniform linear hypergraph. For n  =  2, H is a 2-uniform linear hyperpath since the partition dimension of a graph is 2 if and only if the graph is a simple path (2-uniform linear hyperpath) [\cite=rp1]. For n  =  3, k, odd and for all n  ≥  4, if H is not a hyperpath then either H contains a hypercycle or H is a hypertree. Suppose that H contains a hypercycle, then by using the similar arguments as given in the proof of Theorem [\ref=tt8], we can see that pd(H)  ≥  n + 1, a contradiction. Now, suppose that H is a hypertree. Consider a path P : v,E1,w1,E2,w2,...,El - 1,wl - 1,El,u between two diametral vertices v and u in H. Then P contains either a pendant hyperedge, say Ep, or a branch with joint Ep1 (say), or both a pendant hyperedge and a branch. In the first case, if [formula] (i  ≠  j), then there exist two vertices x,y in H, either x∈Ep and y∈Ei or Ej, or x∈Ei and y∈Ej, such that x,y∈St (say) and have [formula], where 0 is at the tth place. If [formula] for all i  ≠  1,l, then there are two vertices x∈Ep and y∈Ei such that x,y∈Sj (say) and have [formula], where 0 is at the jth place, a contradiction to the fact that Π is resolving partition. Similarly, in the second and third case, we can see that a partition of cardinality n is not a resolving partition of V(H). Thus H is an n-uniform linear hyperpath.

Recall that the rank of a hypergraph H is the maximum number of vertices in a hyperedge. One might think that the partition dimension of H is always greater than or equal to the rank of H. This is true for an n-uniform linear hyperpath and an n-uniform linear hypercycle Ck,3 with even k. But, it is not true, in general, as we show in the following example:

Let H be a hypergraph with vertex set V(H) = {vi: 1  ≤  i  ≤  11} and edge set [formula] Clearly, rank(H) = 7, λ  =  5 and [formula] is a minimum resolving partition of V(H). This implies that pd(H)  =  6  ≠  rank(H).

Likewise the results on the metric dimension of the primal and the dual graph of a hypergraph, we have the following two results on the partition dimension of the primal and the dual graph of a hypergraph, respectively:

Let H be a hypergraph and prim(H) be the primal graph of H. Then pd(H)  =  pd(prim(H)).

Let H* be the dual of a hypergraph H and M(H*) be the middle graph of H*. Then pd(H*)  =  pd(M(H*)).

Since, it was shown that the simple paths Pm are the only graphs with pd(Pm)  =  2 [\cite=rp1] and the partition dimension of the simple cycles Cm is 3, so, by Theorem [\ref=tt6], we have the following corollaries:

Let H be a hypergraph and H* be the dual of H. Then pd(H*)  =  2 if and only if H is a hyperpath.

Let H be a hypercycle and H* be the dual of H. Then dim(H*)  =  3.
