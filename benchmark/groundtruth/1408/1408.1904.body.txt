Keywords: Laguerre polynomials; polynomials modulo an integer; 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 33C45, 33C50, 11C08.

Introduction

The generalized Laguerre polynomials in one variable are defined for an arbitrary integer n  ≥  0 and a parameter α  >   - 1 by Rodrigues' relation (see, for example, [\cite=Dunkl], § 1.4.2)

[formula]

In this paper we will consider only non-negative integer values for the parameter α, i.e. we assume from now on that [formula]. Expanding the definition of Lαn(x) using the n-fold product rule and the Pochhammer symbol defined for all [formula] by

[formula]

one immediately comes to the following explicit formulas ([\cite=Dunkl], § 1.4.2):

[formula]

It was established by Schur ([\cite=Schur]) in 1929 that Ln(x)  =  L0n(x) are irreducible over the rationals for all [formula]. Recently this result was generalized by Filaseta and Lam who proved that for all but finitely many [formula], the polynomials Lαn(x) where α is a rational number which is not a negative integer, are irreducible over [formula] (see [\cite=Filaseta]). Note that reducible Lαn do exist, for example, L22(x)  =  1 / 2(x - 2)(x - 6). One of the key characteristics of the Laguerre polynomials Lαn(x) (with a fixed α >  - 1) is that they are orthogonal over the interval (0,  ∞  ) with respect to the weight function ω(x)  =  e- xxα (see chapter 1 of [\cite=Dunkl]). They also satisfy other interesting properties, including the one due to Carlitz ([\cite=Carlitz]), who proved in 1954 that for all [formula], and a rational number α that is integral mod m,

[formula]

There are various examples of families of orthogonal polynomials in several variables and certain properties of the following multivariable Laguerre polynomials have been studied in [\cite=Dunkl] and [\cite=Aktas].

[formula]

Such multivariable Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight function, which is the product of the corresponding weight functions [formula] over the domain, which is the cartesian product of the corresponding domains [formula] (see [\cite=Aktas] and [\cite=Dunkl], § 2.3.5). It is also clear from ([\ref=LaguerreMR]) that such multiple Laguerre polynomials are reducible as soon as they have more than one variable.

In this paper, we introduce a version of two-variable Laguerre polynomials Ln,m(x,y), which are irreducible over the rationals and prove that such Laguerre polynomials satisfy a congruence relation similar to ([\ref=Carlitz]).

The rest of this paper is divided up as follows. In , we introduce our version of Laguerre polynomials in x and y using Rodrigues formula with partial derivatives and derive the corresponding explicit formulas similar to ([\ref=LaguerreX]). In , we establish several auxiliary lemmas and use them to give another proof of the congruence ([\ref=Carlitz]) of Carlitz. § 4 contains a proof of the corresponding congruence for two-variable Laguerre polynomials (see ([\ref=Formula12]) below). In § 5, we discuss the irreducibility over [formula]. Other properties of Ln,m(x,y), including the orthogonality, shall be discussed somewhere else.

Laguerre Polynomials in two variables

As we already wrote, the Laguerre polynomials in x are defined for an arbitrary integer n  ≥  0 and the parameter α  =  0 by Rodrigues' relation [formula]. We apply this approach to define the Laguerre polynomials in two variables as follows.

For all [formula] let

[formula]

{Note: Since [formula], if it happens that f(x,y) depends only on a single variable x we obtain

[formula]

and hence naturally

[formula]

By the same argument we also have

[formula]

Before giving the explicit formulas for Ln,m(x,y) we prove the following formula.

For all [formula] we have

[formula]

where [formula] is as in the definition of the classical Laguerre polynomials.

We use induction on t so suppose t = 0. Hence e(x + y) / 2  ·  Dt∂(e( - x - y) / 2xnym)  =  xnym and the R.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula1]) also yields a single term xnym. Now assume that ([\ref=Formula1]) is true for t = k - 1, then

[formula]

by induction hypothesis (and assuming for a moment that k - 1 < m)

[formula]

[formula]

Since [formula], replacing each term in ([\ref=Formula2]) by the corresponding two terms we can write

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Notice that if m = k - 1 then ([\ref=Formula3]) ends with [formula]. Now, combining in ([\ref=Formula3]) the coefficients of terms that have the same degree in y, introducing j: = i + 1, and using the identity [formula] we obtain further that when k  ≤  m,

[formula]

which finishes the induction and proves lemma. If k - 1 = m the alternation in formula is obvious.

Next theorem gives the explicit formulas for Ln,m(x,y) (cf. with ([\ref=LaguerreX])).

For all [formula] we have

[formula]

[formula]

Using lemma 1 and formula ([\ref=Formula1]) we can write

[formula]

which implies that for [formula]

[formula]

Since for Laguerre polynomials in a single variable x (see [\cite=Dunkl], § 1.4.2)

[formula]

we can continue formula ([\ref=Formula4]) and write

[formula]

which gives the first formula in ([\ref=LagXY]). The second formula follows either from the symmetry or from an argument similar to the one we just gave. To obtain the third formula recall that by ([\ref=LaguerreX]),

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

as was required.

It is well known (see [\cite=Dunkl], § 1.4.2 and § 2.3.5) that Laguerre polynomials in one variable satisfy the differential equation

[formula]

and the multiple Laguerre polynomials [formula] (recall ([\ref=LaguerreMR]) above) satisfy the partial differential equation

[formula]

Here is the corresponding analog for the Laguerre polynomial Ln,m(x,y).

For all [formula] satisfies the following system of partial differential equations.

[formula]

where we used the notations L ~  ~ Ln,m(x,y), [formula], [formula], and so on.

The proof is a straightforward computation using our first two explicit formulas in ([\ref=LagXY]) and the differential equation ([\ref=difeq]).

Another proof of the congruence of Carlitz

In this technical section we prove several auxiliary results. Note that [formula] denotes the Pochhammer symbol, and (p,q) stands for the greatest common divisor of p and q.

For all [formula], [formula], [formula], and non-zero [formula] the following congruence holds.

[formula]

We use induction on n. If n = 0, then t = 0, (x)0 = 1 and the identity has the form

[formula]

But [formula], which implies that

[formula]

and proves the base of induction.

Assume now that ([\ref=cong1]) holds for [formula] and let us prove it for n = k + 1. If in this case t = n = k + 1 then ([\ref=cong1]) again has the form [formula] so we will assume till end of the proof that [formula]. Then we can write the L.H.S of ([\ref=cong1]) as

[formula]

which is congruent modulo q to (l + 1 - p)m - l  ·  (l + 1 + t + q)k - t  ·  (l + 1 + k). Since by the induction hypothesis

[formula]

we deduce that

[formula]

and since (l + 1 + t)k - t  ·  (l + 1 + k) = (l + 1 + t)k + 1 - t the lemma is proved.

Another way to prove it would be to notice, as we did in the base of induction, that [formula] and multiply two congruences modulo p and modulo q together to obtain the congruence modulo (p,q). Our next statement gives a congruence relation for the generalized Laguerre polynomials Lαn(x), which we will use later, and which is interesting in its own right.

For all [formula], [formula], [formula], and non-zero [formula] we have

[formula]

If n = 0, then Lin(x) = Li - qn(x) = 1. If we define l: = i - q then the identity we just saw above [formula], proves the statement in this case. If n  ≥  1, to prove the proposition we compare the corresponding coefficients on the L.H.S and on the R.H.S of ([\ref=cong2]). Since

[formula]

we see that the coefficients of xt, [formula] on the L.H.S. and on the R.H.S. will be respectively

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we can use the congruence, which follows from lemma 3 with l = i - q,

[formula]

to obtain that

[formula]

is congruent modulo the  gcd(p,q) to

[formula]

It shows that the coefficients of xt on the L.H.S. and on the R.H.S. of ([\ref=cong2]) coincide modulo the (p,q) and proves the proposition.

Here is a cute congruence, which follows trivially from this proposition by taking p = q and i = m + q.

For all [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

The proposition will be used later in the proof of our main result. Let us continue with a few more congruences before proving the identity ([\ref=Carlitz]) in a direct way (cf. with Theorem 3 of [\cite=Carlitz]). In the next section this identity together with the proof will be generalized to the case of Laguerre polynomials Ln,m(x,y).

For all [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] we have

[formula]

Using [formula] and [formula] deduce that

[formula]

[formula]

which imply that the L.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula6])

[formula]

Similarly we have for the R.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula6])

[formula]

and therefore ([\ref=Formula6]) will follow from

[formula]

Furthermore,

[formula]

and

[formula]

with [formula] imply that

[formula]

Hence ([\ref=Formula7]) will follow from

[formula]

Since [formula] this congruence ([\ref=Formula8]) is true and thus our formula ([\ref=Formula6]) is proven.

For all [formula], [formula], and [formula] we have

[formula]

Using notations from lemma 5 and assuming that p =  - q and n = s + q with [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Hence we can rewrite lemma 5 as

[formula]

which is what we had to show.

Please notice that, for example if m = 3, ~ q = 6, ~ s = 5, and i = 6, then for the binomial factors from ([\ref=Formula9]) we have

[formula]

so the factor (m + q - i)! in ([\ref=Formula9]) is necessary to guarantee the equality. Now we are ready to give a direct proof of Carlitz' identity for the classical Laguerre polynomials.

(see [\cite=Carlitz]) For all [formula] and [formula] the following congruence holds.

[formula]

First observe that [formula] (cf. with (4.6) of [\cite=Carlitz]). Indeed, p!  ·  Lip(x)  =

[formula]

Therefore it's enough to show that

[formula]

We do it by comparing the coefficients of xt on both sides of ([\ref=Formula10]). Suppose first that [formula], then the coefficient on the R.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula10]) is zero. The corresponding coefficient on the L.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula10]) is

[formula]

Assume now that [formula]. Using ([\ref=LaguerreX]) again we see that the coefficients of xt on the left and right hand sides of ([\ref=Formula10]) are respectively

[formula]

Canceling ( - 1)t on both sides we can rewrite these coefficients as

[formula]

Applying corollary 2 with n = m, ~ p = q, ~ t = i, and i = s we deduce that these coefficients are congruent mod p. This finishes our proof of the identity ([\ref=Carlitz]).

Main theorem

For all [formula] and [formula] we have (cf. with ([\ref=Carlitz]) above)

[formula]

We will compare the corresponding coefficients of xt  ·  yi on both sides of the congruence. Similarly to the one variable case we have [formula]. Indeed, using our third formula in ([\ref=LagXY]) we have

[formula]

so if i + t < p + q then  gcd(p,q) ~ | ~ p!q! / i!t! since either i < q or t < p. If i = q and t = p, the coefficient of xpyq equals ( - 1)p + q and hence

[formula]

If we take the coefficient of xtyi in (n + p)!(m + q)!  ·  Ln + p,m + q(x,y) with t < p or i < q we will have

[formula]

and if, for example, t < p then the integer [formula] is divisible by p, and hence by  gcd(p,q). Since [formula], [formula], and [formula] are all integers,  gcd(p,q) divides the coefficient of xtyi. If t  ≥  p but i < q the proof is similar since [formula]. So to prove theorem 2 it is enough to show that the coefficients of xtyi on the L.H.S. and the R.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula12]) are congruent mod (p,q) for all p  ≤  t  ≤  n + p and q  ≤  i  ≤  m + q.

Thus we assume from now on that [formula] and [formula]. According to the first formula from our theorem 1, the coefficient of yi on the L.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula12]) is

[formula]

which is, due to the identity ([\ref=Carlitz]),

[formula]

Now,

[formula]

which is according to corollary 2 for s = n + p congruent mod q to

[formula]

which by lemma 5 is

[formula]

It shows that the coefficient of yi on the L.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula12]) is

[formula]

Furthermore, proposition 1 allows to replace (i - q - p + 1)m - (i - q)  ·  n!  ·  Lin(x) by (i - q + 1)m - (i - q)  ·  n!  ·  Li - qn(x) modulo (p,q), so the coefficient of yi on the L.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula12]) is

[formula]

Now let s: = t - p, then according to ([\ref=LaguerreX]), the coefficient of xt in ([\ref=Formula14]) will be

[formula]

[formula]

Since by theorem 1, the coefficient of xt - pyi - q in ( - 1)p + q  ·  n!m!  ·  Ln,m(x,y) is

[formula]

we see that the coefficients of xtyi on the L.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula12]) and on the R.H.S. of ([\ref=Formula13]) are congruent mod (p,q), and thus our theorem is proven.

Irreducibility and other related questions

First we observe that

For all [formula] the polynomials Ln,m(x,y) are irreducible over the rationals.

Suppose n  ·  m  ≠  0 and Ln,m(x,y) = f(x,y)  ·  g(x,y) with deg f(x,y) > 0 and deg g(x,y) > 0. Then according to our Note above, [formula]. Since Lk(x) is irreducible for all [formula] (see [\cite=Schur] or [\cite=Filaseta]), we must have either deg f(x,x) = 0 or deg g(x,x) = 0. Assuming without loss of generality that deg f(x,x) = 0 we get deg g(x,x)  =   deg Ln + m(x) = n + m. Since deg g(x,x)  ≤   deg g(x,y) we deduce from last equality that deg Ln,m(x,y)  =  n + m  ≤   deg g(x,y), which contradicts the assumption that deg f(x,y) > 0. If n = 0 or m = 0 our polynomial Ln,m(x,y) reduces to the classical one in a single variable, which is irreducible.

As we have mentioned in the introduction, this is the main distinction of our version of two-variable Laguerre polynomials from those considered in [\cite=Aktas] and [\cite=Dunkl]. As for the orthogonality, one can easily check several examples to see that over the domain [formula] the polynomials Ln,m(x,y) are neither orthogonal with respect to the weight function e- (x + y) nor with respect to e- (x + y) / 2. It would be interesting to see if Ln,m(x,y) are orthogonal with respect to some other weight function.

Laguerre polynomials in one variable have many interesting combinatorial properties. For example, Even and Gillis [\cite=Even] in 1976, showed that an integral of a product of the Laguerre polynomials and e- x can be interpreted as certain permutations of a set of objects of different "colors" (derangements). Jackson [\cite=Jackson] in the same year gave a shorter proof of this result of Even and Gillis using rook polynomials Rn(x). These polynomials satisfy

[formula]

where rk stands for the rook number that counts the number of ways of placing k non-attacking rooks on the full n  ×  n board. We would like to close this paper with a general question if Ln,m(x,y) have any combinatorial properties similar to those of Ln(x). In particular, the two-dimensional rook numbers and their certain properties can be generalized to three and higher dimensions (see, for example, [\cite=Alayont]), so we ask if

[formula]

have a natural interpretation in terms of rook numbers for three-dimensional boards.
