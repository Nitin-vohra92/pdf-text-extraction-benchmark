Introduction

All graphs in this paper are simple, i.e. multiple edges and loops are not allowed. By an ordered bipartite graph (G;A,B), we mean a bipartite graph G with independent sets A and B which partition the vertex set of G and each of A and B has a linear ordering on its elements. We call two vertices u and v consecutive in the linear order <   on A or B if u < v and there is no vertex w such that u < w < v. By identifying two consecutive vertices u and v to a single vertex w, we obtain a new ordered bipartite graph such that the neighbourhood of w is the union of the neighbourhoods of u and v in G. All bipartite graphs in this paper are ordered and so, for simplicity, we usually say bipartite graph G instead of ordered bipartite graph (G;A,B). Two ordered bipartite graphs G and G' are isomorphic if there is a graph isomorphism G  →  G' preserving both parts, possibly exchanging them, and preserving both linear orders. They are equivalent if G' can be obtained from G by reversing the orders in one or both parts of G and possibly exchange the two parts.

If G and H are ordered bipartite graphs, then H is called an interval minor of G if a graph isomorphic to H can be obtained from G by repeatedly applying the following operations:

deleting an edge;

identifying two consecutive vertices.

If H is not an interval minor of G, we say that G avoids H as an interval minor or that G is H-interval minor free. Let ex(p,q,H) denote the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with parts of sizes p and q avoiding H as an interval minor.

In classical Turán extremal graph theory, one asks about the maximum number of edges of a graph of order n which has no subgraph isomorphic to a given graph. Originated from problems in computational and combinatorial geometry, the authors in [\cite=BIE] [\cite=FUR] [\cite=FURHAJ] considered Turán type problems for matrices which can be seen as ordered bipartite graphs. In the ordered version of Turán theory, the question is: what is the maximum number edges of an ordered bipartite graph with parts of size p and q with no subgraph isomorphic to a given ordered bipartite graph? More results on this problem and its variations are given in [\cite=ALBERT] [\cite=BRASS] [\cite=CLA] [\cite=KLA] [\cite=PACH]. As another variation, interval minors were recently introduced by Fox in [\cite=FOX] in the study of Stanley-Wilf limits. He gave exponential upper and lower bounds for [formula]. In this paper, we are interested in the case when H is a complete bipartite graph. We determine the value of [formula] and find bounds on [formula]. We note that our definition of interval minors for ordered bipartite graphs is slightly different from Fox's definition for matrices, since we allow exchanging parts of the bipartition, so for us a matrix and its transpose are the same. Of course, when the matrix of H is symmetric, the two definitions coincide.

[formula] as interval minor

For simplicity, we denote [formula] by [formula]. In this section we find the exact value of this quantity. Let (G;A,B) be an ordered bipartite graph where A has ordering [formula] and B has ordering [formula]. The vertices a1 and b1 are called bottom vertices whereas ap and bq are said to be top vertices. The degree of a vertex v is denoted by d(v).

For any positive integers p and q, we have

[formula]

Let (G;A,B) be a bipartite graph. Suppose that A has ordering [formula] and B has ordering [formula]. For [formula], let

[formula]

Since G is [formula]-interval minor free, [formula]. Each bj∈B appears in at least d(bj) - 1 of sets Ai, [formula]. It follows that This proves that [formula].

If (G;A,B) and (G';A',B') are disjoint ordered bipartite graphs and the bottom vertices x,y of G are adjacent and the top vertices x',y' of G' are adjacent, then we denote by [formula] the ordered bipartite graph obtained from [formula] by identifying x with x' and y with y', where the linear orders of [formula] and [formula] are such that the vertices of G' precede those of G. The graph [formula] is called the concatenation of G and G'.

In the description of [formula]-interval minor free graphs below, we shall use the following simple observation, whose proof is left to the reader. Let G and G' be vertex disjoint Kr,s-interval minor free bipartite graphs with [formula] and [formula] such that the bottom vertices in G are adjacent and the top vertices in G' are adjacent. Then [formula] is Kr,s-interval minor free.

We introduce a family of [formula]-interval minor free bipartite graphs which would turn out to be extremal. Let [formula] and let p and q be positive integers and let [formula] and [formula]. We can write [formula] and [formula], where [formula], [formula]. Suppose now that r < s. Let H0 be [formula] and let Hi be a copy of [formula] for [formula]. The concatenation [formula] is [formula]-interval minor free by the above observation. It has parts of sizes p and [formula]. It also has [formula] edges. Finally, let H+  =  K1,q - q' + 1. The graph [formula] has parts of sizes p,q and has [formula] edges. An example is depicted in Figure [\ref=ex2f](b), where the identified top and bottom vertices used in concatenations are shown as square vertices.

By Lemma [\ref=frtbd] and Example [\ref=ex1], the following is obvious.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula], where [formula], [formula]. If r < s, then

[formula]

Extremal graphs for excluded [formula] given in Example [\ref=ex1] are of the form of a concatenation of r copies of [formula] together with [formula] and K1,t where [formula]. Note that the latter graph itself is a concatenation of copies of K1,2 and that the constituents concatenated in another order than given in the example, are also extremal graphs. For an example, consider the graph in Figure [\ref=ex2f](c), which is also extremal for [formula]. Rearranging the order of concatenations is not the only way to obtain examples of extremal graphs. What one can do is also using the following operation. Delete a vertex in B of degree 1, replace it by a degree-1 vertex x adjacent to any vertex ai∈A which is adjacent to two consecutive vertices bj and bj + 1, and put x between bj and bj + 1 in the linear order of B. This gives other extremal examples that cannot always be written as concatenations of complete bipartite graphs.

And there is another operation that gives somewhat different extremal examples. Suppose that G is an extremal graph for [formula] with r < s as above. If A contains a vertex ai of degree [formula] (by Theorem [\ref=thm:r<s], degree cannot be smaller since the deletion of that vertex would contradict the theorem), then we can delete ai and obtain an extremal graph for [formula]. The deletion of vertices of degrees [formula] can be repeated. Or we can delete any set of k vertices from A if they are incident to precisely [formula] edges.

We now proceed with the much more difficult case, in which we have [formula], i.e. r = s.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Similarly as in Example [\ref=ex1], let G0 be Ke,f and let Gi be a copy of [formula] for [formula]. Let [formula] be the concatenation [formula]. This graph is [formula]-interval minor free. It has parts of sizes p,q and has [formula] edges. An example is illustrated in Figure [\ref=ex2f](a).

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Since the graphs in Example [\ref=ex2] attain the stated bound, it suffices to establish the upper bound, [formula]. Let (G;A,B) be a bipartite graph with parts of sizes p,q and with [formula] edges. Let A have ordering [formula] and B have ordering [formula]. Note that any two consecutive vertices of G have at least one common neighbour. Otherwise, by identifying two consecutive vertices with no common neighbour lying say in A, we obtain a graph with parts of sizes p - 1,q and with [formula] edges. This is a contradiction since clearly [formula].

For [formula], let

[formula]

Also let [formula], where h is the smallest index for which bh∈Ai. Since G is [formula]-interval minor free, [formula]. For each vertex bj∈B, define

[formula]

and let d'(bj) = |D(bj)|. Every vertex in [formula] is adjacent to bj and also to some vertex bh∈B with h < j and hence

[formula]

since G is [formula]-interval minor free. Let h and h' be the smallest and largest indices such that [formula], respectively. Observe that [formula]. We claim that bj appears in sets [formula]. Let [formula]. Since bj is adjacent to ah and to ah', we have bj∈Ai. We know that ah is adjacent to some vertex bj1 with j1 < j. Also ah' is adjacent to some vertex bj2 with j2 < j. Suppose that [formula]. Now we use the property that every two consecutive vertices of G have at least one common neighbour for consecutive pairs of vertices bt,bt + 1 ([formula]). It follows that there is [formula] such that bj0 is in Ai. If j2 < j1, the same property used for [formula] shows that there exists j0, [formula], such that bj0∈Ai. Since j0 < j, from the definition of A'i, we conclude that bj∈A'i. So we have proved the claim. We conclude that bj appears in sets [formula] for some [formula] and t = d(bj) - d'(bj) - 1.

Let [formula]. We have [formula]. By the conclusion in the last paragraph, each bj∈B appears in at least d(bj) - d'(bj) - 1 consecutive sets A'i. Combined with ([\ref=dajdj]), we conclude that bj appears in at least d(bj) - d'(bj) - 1 - (e - 1) of sets A'i, where i∈S. Note that this number is negative for j = 1 since d(b1) = d'(b1). Now it follows that

[formula]

By adding d(b1) - d'(b1) to the left side of ([\ref=eq:2]) and noting that [formula] and [formula], we obtain therefrom that

[formula]

This in turn yields that [formula], which we were to prove.

Example [\ref=ex2] describes extremal graphs for Theorem [\ref=rs2]. They are concatenations of complete bipartite graphs, all of which but at most one are copies of [formula]. If e = 1 and f > 1, vertices of degree 1 can be inserted anywhere between two consecutive neighbors of their neighbor in A. But in all other cases, we believe that all extremal graphs are as in Example [\ref=ex2], except that the order of concatenations can be different.

K2,2 as interval minor

In this section we determine the structure of K2,2-interval minor free bipartite graphs. We first define two families of K2,2-interval minor free graphs. For every positive integer [formula], let [formula] and [formula] with ordering [formula] and [formula], respectively. Let Rn be the bipartite graph with parts A,B and edge set

[formula]

Similarly we define a graph Sn for every integer [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] with ordering [formula] and [formula], respectively. Let Sn be the bipartite graph with parts A,B and edge set

[formula]

For instance, R5 and S4 are shown in Figure [\ref=figsn].

For every positive integers p and q, we have m(p,q,2) = p + q - 1.

By Lemma [\ref=frtbd], [formula]. We construct K2,2-interval minor free bipartite graphs with parts of sizes p,q and with p + q - 1 edges. This is easy if [formula]. So let [formula]. Consider Sp - 3 and add edges a1y,zbp - 3. Also add q - p vertices into the set B, all of them ordered between y and b2', and join each of them to a1. The resulting graph has parts of size p,q and has p + q - 1 edges.

In what follows we assume that (G;A,B) is a bipartite graph without K2,2 as an interval minor. Let A and B have the ordering [formula] and [formula], respectively. A vertex in G of degree 0 is said to be reducible. If d(ai) = 1 and the neighbor bj of ai is adjacent to ai - 1 if i > 1 and is adjacent to ai + 1 if i < p, then ai is also said to be reducible. Similarly we define when a vertex bj∈B is reducible. Clearly, if ai (or bj) is reducible, then G has a K2,2-interval minor if and only if G - ai (G - bj) has one. Therefore, we may assume that we remove all reducible vertices from G. When G has no reducible vertices, we say that G is reduced, which we assume henceforth.

Let X = {a1,a2} if d(a1) = 1 and X = {a1}, otherwise. Similarly, let Y = {ap - 1,ap} if d(ap) = 1 and Y = {ap}, otherwise; Z = {b1,b2} if d(b1) = 1 and Z = {b1}, otherwise; T = {bq - 1,bq} if d(bq) = 1 and T = {bq}, otherwise. We may assume that all these sets are mutually disjoint. Otherwise G has a simple structure - it is equivalent to a subgraph of a graph shown in Figure [\ref=fig:XY] and any such graph has no K2,2 as interval minor. Note that each such subgraph becomes equivalent to a subgraph of R2 after removing reducible vertices.

There is an edge from X to b1 or bq.

Suppose that there is no edge from X to {b1,bq}. Since G is reduced, there are two distinct vertices bi and bj (1 < i < j < q) connected to X. Assume that b1 and bq are adjacent to ak and al, respectively. Note that [formula]. Consider the sets X, [formula] and [formula] and identify them to single vertices to get K2,2 as an interval minor, a contradiction.

Note that Claim [\ref=Xadj] also applies to Y,Z and T. Hence, considering an equivalent graph of G instead of G if necessary, we may assume that there is an edge from X to Z. If there is no edge from Y to T, then there are edges from Y to Z and from T to X. By reversing the order of B, we obtain an equivalent graph that has edges from X to Z and from Y to T. Thus we may assume henceforth that the following claim holds:

The graph G has edges from X to Z and from Y to T.

Every vertex of G has degree at most 2, except possibly one of a2,b2 and/or one of ap - 1,bq - 1, which may be of degree 3. If d(a2) = 3, then it has neighbors b1,b3,b4, we have d(a1) = d(b1) = d(b2) = 1 and a1b2∈E(G). Similar situations occur when b2, ap - 1, or bq - 1 are of degree 3.

Suppose that [formula]. We claim that ai has at most one neighbour in Z. Otherwise, [formula] and hence d(b1) = 1 and aib1,aib2∈E(G). This is a contradiction since G is reduced. Similarly we see that ai has at most one neighbour in T.

Suppose now that a middle neighbor bj of ai is in [formula]. Let bj1 and bj2 be neighbors of ai with j1 < j < j2. If d(bj) > 1, then an edge akbj (k  ≠  i), the edges joining X and Z and joining Y and T, and the edge aibj1 (if k < i) or aibj2 (if k > i) can be used to obtain a K2,2-interval minor. Thus, d(bj) = 1.

Let us now consider bj - 1. Suppose that bj - 1 is not adjacent to ai. Then j1 < j - 1. If bj - 1 is adjacent to a vertex ak, where k < i, then the edges aibj1,akbj - 1 and the edges joining X with Z and Y with T give rise to a K2,2-interval minor in G (which is excluded), unless the following situation occurs: the edge akbj - 1 is equal to the edge joining X and Z. This is only possible if j1 = 1, j = 3 and |Z| = 2, i.e., d(b1) = 1. If a1 is adjacent to b1 or to some other bt with t > 2, we obtain a K2,2-interval minor again. So, it turns out that k = 1 and d(a1) = 1. If i > 2, then we consider a neighbor of a2. It cannot be b2 since then a1 would be reducible. It can neither be b1 or bt with t > 2 since this would yield a K2,2-interval minor. Thus i = 2.

Similarly, a contradiction is obtained when k > i. (Here we do not have the possibility of an exception as in the case when k = 1.) Thus, we conclude that bj - 1 is adjacent to ai or we have the situation that i = 2, j = 3, etc. as described above. Similarly we conclude that bj + 1 is adjacent to ai unless we have i = p - 1, j = q - 2, etc. Note that we cannot have the exceptional situations in both cases at the same time since then we would have i = 2 = p - 1 and [formula] would be nonempty. If aibj - 1 and aibj + 1 are both edges, then bj would be reducible, a contradiction. Thus, the only possibility for a vertex of degree more than 2 is the one described in the claim.

We have a1 adjacent to b1 or we have a1 adjacent only to b2 and b1 adjacent only to a2.

Suppose that a1b1∉E(G). By Claim [\ref=cl:XZYT], X is adjacent to Z and Y to T. If X is adjacent to a vertex bj∉Z and Z is adjacent to a vertex ai∉X, then we have a K2,2-interval minor in G. Thus, we may assume that X has no neighbors outside Z. Since a1b1∉E(G), we have that a1b2∈E(G). In particular, d(a1) = 1 and d(b1) = 1. Then a2∈X and b2∈Z. Since G is reduced, a2b2∉E(G). Since all neighbors of X are in Z, we conclude that a2 is adjacent to b1. This yields the claim.

The same argument applies to the bottom vertices.

We can now describe the structure of K2,2-interval minor free graphs. In fact, we have proved the following theorem.

Every reduced bipartite graph with no K2,2 as an interval minor is equivalent to a subgraph of Rn or Sn for some positive integer n.

A matching of size n is a 1-regular bipartite graph on 2n vertices. The following should be clear from Theorem [\ref=maink22].

For every integer n  ≥  4, there are exactly eight K2,2-interval minor free matchings of size n. They form three different equivalence classes.

[formula] as interval minor

For [formula]-interval minors in bipartite graphs, we start in a similar manner as when excluding [formula]. We first establish a simple upper bound, which will later turn out to be optimal in the case when the sizes of the two parts are not very balanced.

For any integers [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

Let (G;A,B) be a bipartite graph with parts of sizes p and q. Suppose that A has ordering [formula] and B has ordering [formula]. For [formula], let

[formula]

If G is [formula]-interval minor free, we have [formula]. Each bj∈B of degree at least 2 appears in precisely d(bj) - 2 of the sets Ai, [formula]. It follows that This gives [formula], as desired.

Let (G;A,B) and (G';A',B') be disjoint ordered bipartite graphs. Let ap - 1,ap be the last two vertices in the linear order in A and let bq - 1,bq be the last two vertices in B. Denote by a1',a2' and b1',b2' the first two vertices in A' and B', respectively. Let us denote by [formula] the ordered bipartite graph obtained from G and G' by identifying ap - 1 with a1', ap with a2', bq - 1 with b1', and bq with b2'. The resulting ordered bipartite graph [formula] is called the 2-concatenation of G and G'. We have a similar observation as used earlier for [formula]-free graphs. If ap - 1,ap and bq - 1,bq form K2,2 in G and a1',a2' and b1',b2' form K2,2 in G', and [formula] and [formula], then [formula] is Kr,s-interval minor free if and only if G and G' are both Kr,s-interval minor free.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] where [formula], [formula] and r < s. Let [formula] be the 2-concatenation of [formula], r copies of [formula] and [formula]. This graph has parts of sizes p and q and has [formula] edges.

By Lemma [\ref=frtbd3] and Example [\ref=ex3], the following is clear.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] where [formula], [formula] and r < s. Then

[formula]

We now consider the remaining cases, where both parts are "almost balanced", i.e., [formula].

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] where [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula] be the 2-concatenation of Ke,f and r copies of [formula]. This graph is [formula]-interval minor free, has parts of sizes p and q, and has [formula] edges. It follows that

[formula]

We conjecture that this is in fact the exact value for [formula]. Unfortunately, we have not been able to adopt the proof of Theorem [\ref=rs2] for this case.
