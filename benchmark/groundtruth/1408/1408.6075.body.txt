A Sylow theorem for the integral group ring of [formula]

Abstract: For [formula] denote by [formula] the integral group ring over G and by [formula] the group of units of augmentation 1 in [formula] Let r be a prime different from p. Using the so called HeLP-method we prove that units of r-power order in [formula] are rationally conjugate to elements of G. As a consequence we prove that subgroups of prime power order in [formula] are rationally conjugate to subgroups of G, if p = 2 or f  =  1.

Let G be a finite group and [formula] the integral group ring over G. Denote by [formula] the group of units of augmentation 1 in [formula], i.e. those units whose coefficients sum up to 1. We say that a finite subgroup U of [formula] is rationally conjugate to a subgroup W of G, if there exists a unit [formula] such that x- 1Ux = W. The question if some, or even all, finite subgroups of [formula] are rationally conjugate to subgroups of G was proposed by H. J. Zassenhaus in the '60s and published in [\cite=Zassenhaus]. This so called Zassenhaus Conjectures motivated a lot of research. E.g. A. Weiss proved the strongest version, that all finite subgroups of [formula] are rationally conjugate to subgroups of G, provided G is nilpotent [\cite=Weiss88] [\cite=Weiss91]. K. W. Roggenkamp and L. L. Scott obtained a counterexample [\cite=RoggenkampScott] to this strong conjecture. The version, which asks whether all finite cyclic subgroups of [formula] are rationally conjugate to subgroups of G, the so called First Zassenhaus Conjecture, is however still open, see e.g. [\cite=HertweckEdinb], [\cite=CyclicByAbelian]. Though mostly solvable groups were considered when studying such questions, there are some results available for series of non-solvable groups. E.g. a work on the symmetric groups [\cite=Peterson] or for Lie-groups of small rank [\cite=Bleher99]. The groups [formula], which are also the object of study in this paper, found also some special attention in [\cite=Wagner], [\cite=HertweckBrauer], [\cite=HertweckHoefertKimmi], [\cite=AndreasKimmi] or in [\cite=PSL2p3]. In this paper we will limit our attention to "Sylow-like" results, i.e. to finite p-subgroups of [formula] We say that a weak Sylow theorem holds for [formula], if every finite p-subgroup of [formula] is isomorphic to some subgroup of G, and that a strong Sylow theorem holds for [formula], if every finite p-subgroup of [formula] is even rationally conjugate to a subgroup of G. First Sylow-like results for integral group rings were obtained in [\cite=RoggenkampKimmi]. Later M. A. Dokuchaev and S. O. Juriaans proved a strong Sylow theorem for special classes of solvable groups [\cite=DokuchaevJuriaans] and M. Hertweck, C. Höfert and W. Kimmerle proved a weak Sylow theorem for [formula] where p = 2 or f  ≤  2. The results of this article are as follows:

Theorem 1: Let [formula], let r be a prime different from p and let u be a torsion unit in [formula] of r-power order. Then u is rationally conjugate to a group element.

Theorem 2: Let [formula] such that f  =  1 or p  =  2. Then any subgroup of prime power order of [formula] is rationally conjugate to a subgroup of G, i.e. a strong Sylow theorem holds in [formula]

HeLP-method and known results

Let G be a finite group. A very useful notion to study rational conjugacy of torsion units are partial augmentations: Let [formula] and xG be the conjugacy class of the element x∈G in G. Then [formula] is called the partial augmentation of u at x. This relates to rational conjugacy via:

Let [formula] be a torsion unit. Then u is rationally conjugate to a group element if and only if εx(uk)  ≥  0 for all x∈G and all powers uk of u.

It is well known that if u  ≠  1 is a torsion unit in [formula], then ε1(u) = 0 by the so called Berman-Higman Theorem [\cite=SehgalBook]. If εx(u)  ≠  0, then the order of x divides the order of u [\cite=MarciniakRitterSehgalWeiss], [\cite=HertweckColloq]. Moreover the exponent of G and of [formula] coincide [\cite=CohnLivingstone] and if U is a finite subgroup of [formula] the order of U divides the order of G [\cite=ZK] (or [\cite=SehgalBook]). We will use these facts in the following without further mention.

Let u be a torsion unit in [formula] of order n and ζ a primitive complex n-th root of unity and let K be some field, whose characteristic p does not divide n. Let ξ be a (not necessarily primitive) complex n-th root of unity and let D be a K-representation of G with character φ. Here φ is understood as an ordinary or Brauer character. It was first obtained by Luthar and Passi for K having characteristic 0 [\cite=LP89] and later generalized by Hertweck for positive characteristic [\cite=HertweckBrauer] that the multipilicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of D(u), which we denote by μ(ξ,u,φ) and which is of course a non-negative integer, may be computed as

[formula]

where as usual [formula] The multiplicity of a complex root of unity as an eigenvalue of a matrix over a field of positive characteristic should be understood, here and in the rest of the paper, in the sense of Brauer. If u is of prime power order rk for the first sum in the expression above we obtain

[formula]

Using these formulas to find possible partial augmentations for torsion units in integral group rings of finite groups is today called HeLP-method. For a diagonalizable matrix A we will write A  ~  (a1,...,an), if the eigenvalues of A, with multiplicities, are a1,...,an.

All subgroups of [formula] were first known to Dickson [\cite=Dickson]. Let [formula] Up to conjugation there is exactly one cyclic group of order p, [formula] and [formula] respectively in G and every element of G lies in a conjugate of such a group. In particular there is only one conjugacy class of involutions in G. The Sylow p-subgroups are elementary-abelian, the Sylow subgroups for all other primes, which are odd, are cyclic and if p  ≠  2 the Sylow 2-subgroup is dihedral or a Kleinian four-group. There are d conjugacy classes of elements of order p. If g∈G is not of order p or 2 its only distinct conjugate in 〈g〉 is g- 1. We denote by a a fixed element of order [formula] and by b a fixed element of order [formula]

The modular representation theory of [formula] in defining characteristic is well known. All irreducible representations were first given by R. Brauer and C. Nesbitt [\cite=BrauerNesbitt]. The explicit Brauer table of [formula], which contains the Brauer table of [formula], may be found in [\cite=SrinivasanPSL]. In particular all characters are real valued since any p-regular element is conjugate to its inverse. However, I was not able to find the following Lemma in the literature, except, without proof, in Hertwecks preprint [\cite=HertweckBrauer], so a short proof is included.

Let [formula] and [formula] There are p-modular representations of G given by Θ0,Θ1,Θ2,... such that there is a primitive [formula]-th root of unity α and a primitive [formula]-th root of unity β satisfying

[formula]

for every [formula]

Proof: The group [formula] acts on the vector space spanned by the homogenous polynomials in two commuting variables x, y of some fixed degree e extending the natural operation on the 2-dimensional vector space spanned by x, y, see e.g. [\cite=Alperin]. Since [formula] this action affords a [formula]-representation if and only if e is even and p is odd or p = 2. So let from now on e be even. Call this representation [formula] Let γ be an eigenvalue of an element in [formula] mapping onto a under the natural projection from [formula] to [formula]. Then [formula] has the same eigenvalues as [formula] Now [formula], so the eigenvalues are [formula] Thus setting α  =  γ2 proves the first part of the claim. Now let δ be an eigenvalue of an element in [formula] mapping onto b under the natural projection from [formula] to [formula]. The action of [formula] may of course be extended to [formula] So [formula] has the same eigenvalues as [formula] where the matrix may be seen as an element in [formula] Then doing the same calculations as above and setting β  =  δ2 proves the Lemma.

Notation: The Brauer-character belonging to a representation Θi from the Lemma above will be denoted by φi.

Using the HeLP-method R. Wagner [\cite=Wagner] and Hertweck [\cite=HertweckBrauer] obtained already some results about rational conjugacy of torsion units of prime power order in [formula] Part of Wagners result was published in [\cite=BovdiHoefertKimmi].

[\cite=Wagner] (also [\cite=HertweckBrauer]) Let [formula] and f  ≤  2. If u is a unit of order p in [formula], then u is rationally conjugate to a group element.

Remark: The HeLP-method does not suffice to prove rational conjugacy to a group element of a unit of order p in [formula] if p is odd and f  ≥  3. There is also no other method or idea around how one could e.g. obtain whether a unit of order 3 in [formula] is rationally conjugate to a group element or not.

[\cite=HertweckBrauer] Let [formula] and let r be a prime different from p. If u is a unit of order r in [formula], then u is rationally conjugate to an element of G.

[\cite=HertweckBrauer] Let [formula], let r be a prime different from p and u a torsion unit in [formula] of order rn. Let m  <  n and denote by S a set of representatives of conjugacy classes of elements of order rm in G. Then [formula] If moreover g is an element of order rn in G, then μ(1,u,φ)  =  μ(1,g,φ) for every p-modular Brauer character φ of G.

If one is interested not only in cyclic groups the following result is very useful. It may be found e.g. in [\cite=SehgalBook] or in [\cite=Valenti].

Let G be a finite group, U a finite subgroup of [formula] and H a subgroup of G isomorphic to U. If σ:U  →  H is an isomorphism such that χ(u)  =  χ(σ(u)) for all u∈U and all irreducible complex characters χ of G, then U is rationally conjugate to H.

Proof of the results

We will first sum up some elementary number theoretical facts. The notatian [formula] will mean, that a is congruent b modulo c.

Let t and s be natural numbers such that s divides t and denote by ζt and ζs a primitive complex t-th root of unity and s-th root of unity respectively. Then

[formula]

where μ denotes the Möbius function and φ Euler's totient function. So for a prime r and natural numbers n,m with m  ≤  n we have

[formula]

Let moreover i and j be integers prime to r, then

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=Trace]: Let s  =  pf11  ·  ...  ·  pfkk be the prime factorisation of s. For a natural number l let [formula] As is well known, [formula] From this the case s = 1 follows immediately. Otherwise we have

[formula]

Now [formula] and this gives the first formula. The other formulas are special cases of this general formula since φ(rn)  =  (r - 1)(rn - 1).

Proof of Theorem 1: Let [formula], let r be a prime different from p and let u be a torsion unit in [formula] of order rn. Let ζ be an primitive complex rn-th root of unity and set [formula] If n  =  1, then by Lemma [\ref=n=1] u is rationally conjugate to an element in G, so assume n  ≥  2. Assume further that by induction ur is rationally conjugate to an element in G. We will proceed by induction on m, where 1  ≤  m  ≤  n. For a fixed m let [formula] if r is odd and [formula] if r = 2. Let [formula] be a full set of representatives of conjugacy classes of elements of order rm in G such that xi1  =  xi (this is possible by the group theoretical properties of G given above) and let S be a set of representatives of conjugacy classes of elements of G of r-power order not greater than rn containing x1,...,xl. The proof will be divided in several steps:

For m  <  n we will show εxi(u)  =  0 for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  l, i.e. the partial augmentations of u at elements of order rm vanish. This will be proved by an induction on k  ≤  m showing

εxi(u)  =  εxj(u) for [formula]

If r is even it suffices to prove this for k = m  -  1, if r is odd we will prove it for k = m. It then follows from Lemma [\ref=Bovdi] that εxi(u)  =  0 for all xi.

For m  =  n after reordering the x1,...,xl we will show εx1(u)  =  1 and εxi(u)  =  0 for i  ≥  2. Together with a) this proves the Theorem. This will be achieved by an induction on k to show several facts:

εx1(u)  =  1 and εxi(u)  =  0 for [formula]

εxi(u)  =  εxj(u) for [formula] and [formula]

These statements will be proved for k  =  n - 1. If r is even this is already enough. In case r is odd we will moreover prove that [formula] for [formula] which then also implies the Theorem.

So let m be a natural number such that m < n. If m = 0 statement a) is the Berman-Higman Theorem and if r = 2 and m = 1 it follows from Lemma [\ref=Bovdi] and the fact that there is only one conjugacy class of involutions in G. So assume we know εx(u)  =  0 for [formula] The representations and the corresponding characters of G from Lemma [\ref=preps] will be used freely. Statement (i) in a) is certainly true for k = 0, so assume εxi(u)  =  εxj(u) for [formula] for some k. Since ur is rationally conjugate to a group element, there exists a primitive rn - 1-th root of unity ζrn - 1 such that

[formula]

Now all p-modular Brauer characters of G are real valued and thus using the last statement in Lemma [\ref=Bovdi] we obtain that Θrk(u)  ~  (1,a1,a- 11,a2,a- 12,...,ark,a- 1rk), where for every i we have ai a root of unity such that arm - ki  ≠  1. So for every primitive rm - k-th root of unity ζrm - k we have μ(ζrm - k,u,φrk)  =  0. Let ζrm be a primitive rm-th root of unity such that we have Θrk(x1)  ~  (1,ζrm,ζ- 1rm,...,ζrkrm,ζ- rkrm) and set ξ  =  ζrkrm. Let moreover α be a natural number prime to r such that 1  ≤  α  ≤  l. Thus μ(ξα,u,φrk) = 0 and εx(u)  =  0 for [formula]. From here on a sum over i, if not specified, will always mean a sum over all i satisfying 1  ≤  i  ≤  l and [formula] Then using the HeLP-method we get

[formula]

In the third line we used that if [formula] is a root of unity of r-power order such that rm - k  ≠  1, then ξ has the same order as [formula] and so [formula] by Proposition [\ref=Trace]. Thus for an element x∈S of order at least rm we get

[formula]

Note that as i is prime to r the congruence [formula] implies [formula] for rm - k∉{1,2} and these exceptions don't have to be considered by our assumptions on m and k. There are now two cases to consider. First assume k  <  m - 1, so ξ is at least of order r2 and thus [formula] Moreover μ(ξαr,ur,φrk) = 0 and using Proposition [\ref=Trace] in ([\ref=A]) we obtain

[formula]

So

[formula]

But since by induction εxi(u)  =  εxj(u) for [formula] the summands on the left hand side are all equal and since changing α by rm - k - 1 does not change the right hand side of the equation we get εxi(u)  =  εxj(u) for [formula] Now consider k = m - 1, then ξ is a primitive r-th root of unity and thus [formula] and μ(ξαr,ur,φrk)  =  μ(1,ur,φrk)  =  1. So using Proposition [\ref=Trace] in ([\ref=A]) we get

[formula]

So

[formula]

Now by Lemma [\ref=Bovdi] the right side of this equation is zero and by induction all summands on the left side are equal. Hence varying α gives εxi(u)  =  0 for every xi and part a) is proved.

So assume m  =  n. As in the computation above we have

[formula]

for some primitive rn - 1-th root of unity ζrn - 1 and Θrk(u)  ~  (1,a1,a- 11,a2,a- 12,...,ark,a- 1rk), where ai are roots of unity such that arn - ki  ≠  1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  rk - 1 and ark is some primitive rn - k-th root of unity. Set ξ  =  ark and reorder the x1,...,xl such that Θ1(x1)  ~  Θ1(u), but still xi1  =  xi. Then xr1 is rationally conjugate to ur. We will proceed by induction on k. Let α be a natural number prime to r with 1  ≤  α  ≤  l. Using the HeLP-method and εx(u)  =  0 for [formula] we obtain, doing the same calculations as in ([\ref=A]):

[formula]

As ur is rationally conjugate to xr1 we know that ξ±  r are eigenvalues of Θrk(ur). So we get

[formula]

There are now several cases to consider: Statement (ii) from b) is clear for k = 0. So let k  <  n - 1. For [formula] set α  =  i. Then μ(ξα,u,φrk)  =  μ(ξrα,ur.φrk)  =  0 and since ξ has order at least r2, also [formula] Thus we can do the same computations as in ([\ref=B]) to obtain (ii) for k + 1. So (ii) holds for k = n - 1. To obtain the base case for (i) set k = 0. Then ξ is at least of order r2, i.e. [formula], and from ([\ref=C]) we obtain (similar to the computation in ([\ref=B])):

[formula]

and

[formula]

for [formula] and α  ≠  1. Substracting [\eqref=F] from [\eqref=E] gives

[formula]

for every [formula] and α  ≠  1. Let [formula] Then summing up [\eqref=E] with the equations [\eqref=F] for all [formula] gives

[formula]

So [formula] and the base case of (i) follows from ([\ref=D]). So assume 0  ≤  k  <  n - 1. Then ξ is at least of order r2, i.e. [formula]. By induction [formula] and for [formula] from ([\ref=C]) computing as in ([\ref=B]) we obtain

[formula]

For [formula] and [formula] we obtain the same way

[formula]

Thus subtracting the last equation from the one before gives

[formula]

The summands on the right hand side are all equal by (ii), so εxα(u)  =  0, as claimed. Finally let r be odd, k  =  n  -  1 and [formula] Then ξ is of order r, i.e. [formula] and μ(ξαr,ur,φrk)  =  μ(1,ur,φrk)  =  3. So from ([\ref=C]) computing as in ([\ref=E]) we obtain

[formula]

As by (ii) all summands in the last sum are equal, we get εxα(u)  =  0 and the Theorem is finally proved.

Proof of Theorem 2: Let [formula] such that f  =  1 or p  =  2. Assume first that r is an odd prime, which is not p, and R is an r-subgroup of [formula] As every r-subgroup of G is cyclic so is R by [\cite=HertweckCpCp] and thus R is rationally conjugate to a subgroup of G by Theorem 1. If p  ≠  2 and R is a 2-subgroup of [formula], then R is either cyclic or dihedral or a Kleinian four group by [\cite=HertweckHoefertKimmi]. If R is cyclic, then it is rationally conjugate to a subgroup of G by Theorem 1. If R is dihedral or a Kleinian four group let S  =  〈s〉 be a maximal cyclic subgroup of R. Then any element of R outside of S is an involution and moreover s is rationally conjugate to an element g∈G by Theorem 1. R is isomorphic to some subgroup H of G, such that the maximal cyclic subgroup of H is generated by g. As there is only one conjugacy class of invoultions in G every isomorphism σ between R and H mapping s to g satisfies χ(σ(u))  =  χ(u) for every irreducible complex character of G and every u∈R. Thus R is rationally conjugate to H by Lemma [\ref=Valenti]. If p = 2 and P is a 2-subgroup of [formula] then all non-trivial elements of P are involutions, so P is elementary abelian and the order of P divides the order of G. As there is again only one conjugacy class of involutions in G every isomorphism σ between P and a subgroup of G isomorphic with P satisfies χ(σ(u))  =  χ(u) for every irreducible complex character of G and every u∈P. So P is rationally conjugate to a subgroup of G by Lemma [\ref=Valenti]. Finally if p is odd and P is a p-subgroup of [formula], then P is cyclic of order p and thus rationally conjugate to a subgroup of G by Lemma [\ref=Wagner].

Remark: Let [formula] and let n be a number prime to p. The structure of the Brauer table of G in defining characteristic yields immidiately, that if we can prove that a unit [formula] of order n is rationally conjugate to an element in G applying the HeLP-method to the Brauer table, then these calculations will hold over any [formula], if n and q are coprime. In this sense it would be interesting, and seems actually achievable, to determine a subset Apf of [formula] such that we can say: The HeLP-method proves that a unit [formula] of order n is rationally conjugate to an element in G if and only if n∈Apf. Test computations yield the conjecture that Apf actually contains all odd numbers prime to p. If this turned out to be true this would yield, using the results in [\cite=HertweckBrauer], the First Zassenhaus Conjecture for the groups [formula] where p is a Fermat- or Mersenne prime. Other interesting questions concerning torsion units of the integral group ring of [formula] were mentioned at the end of [\cite=HertweckHoefertKimmi] and are still open today: If the order of [formula] is divisible by p, is u of order p? Are units of order p rationally conjugate to elements of G? Are p-subgroups in [formula] necessarily abelian? For the last question a positive answer in case f = 3 is given in [\cite=PSL2p3].
