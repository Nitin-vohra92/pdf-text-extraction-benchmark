Coefficient Bounds for Level 2 Cusp Forms and Modular Functions

Introduction

The Fourier coefficients of modular forms encode interesting arithmetic information. To give just three examples, the Fourier coefficients of modular forms are intimately connected to representations of integers as sums of squares [\cite=Rou2], Galois representations [\cite=Rib], and integer partitions (e.g. [\cite=And], Chapter 5). These rich interactions between modular forms and other branches of mathematics have given them a place of central importance in modern number theory.

It is natural to ask about the size of the coefficients of a modular form. The coefficients of cusp forms in particular have attracted a great deal of attention. Ramanujan [\cite=Ram] studied the coefficients of Δ(z), the unique normalized cusp form of weight 12 for [formula] given by

[formula]

where as usual q  =  e2πiz. Ramanujan conjectured that

[formula]

where d(n) is the number of divisors of n. Petersson [\cite=Pet1] generalized Ramanujan's conjecture to cusp forms for congruence subgroups of [formula]. The Ramanujan-Petersson conjectures were proved by Deligne [\cite=Del] as a consequence of his work on the Weil conjectures. The corresponding conjectures for Maass forms and automorphic forms on [formula] for n  >  2 remain unresolved (see [\cite=BB] for details).

Deligne's result applies to newforms, certain cusp forms that are eigenforms for all of the Hecke operators (see Section [\ref=Background_section] for more details). For such a weight k newform, Deligne's work implies that the coefficient of qn is bounded above by [formula]. Any cusp form can be written as a linear combination of newforms and newforms acted on by various operators, so it is still the case that the coefficients of a general cusp form f are [formula]. However, the implied constant depends heavily on f, and it is a nontrivial problem to determine this constant (or even the size of this constant). Several researchers have studied the implied constant in [formula] for various families of cusp forms (see e.g. [\cite=KR], [\cite=Rou1], [\cite=Rou2]). Rouse and the first author [\cite=JR] gave an explicit bound on the implied constant for all cusp forms for [formula] (earlier work of Chua [\cite=Chu] makes Hecke's [formula] bound explicit). For a cusp form [formula] of weight k for [formula], they proved that

[formula]

where [formula] is the dimension of the weight k cusp form space [formula]. The fact that ([\ref=Jenkins_Rouse_Thm]) incorporates the first [formula] coefficients of G is natural, since these coefficients uniquely identify G in [formula].

The main result of this paper makes Deligne's implied constant explicit for weight k cusp forms for Γ0(2). To state our main theorem we define some notation. For a positive even integer k, write [formula], where k'∈{0,2}, hence [formula]. It is convenient to write k in this form because then the dimension of Sk(2) is [formula]. We define a function B(k) by

[formula]

We now state the main result of this paper.

Let k  ≥  8 be an even integer, and let G be a cusp form of weight k for Γ0(2). Write

[formula]

Then

[formula]

The condition k  ≥  8 is not a restriction at all, since Sk(2) = {0} for k  <  8.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Main_Theorem] is similar to the proof of ([\ref=Jenkins_Rouse_Thm]). We study the basis of cusp forms for Sk(2) given by

[formula]

with [formula]. This basis is useful because, for any given G∈Sk(2), it is trivial to write G in terms of the basis elements. Hence, Theorem [\ref=Main_Theorem] follows from suitable bounds on the coefficients of Fk,m. We write Fk,m as

[formula]

where [formula], the fi are oldforms, and the gj are newforms. We choose the fi so that their coefficients are bounded in absolute value by [formula], for C  ≥  1 an absolute constant. It follows that the coefficients of Fk,m are bounded above by

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it suffices to get an upper bound on [formula].

Letting 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 denote the Petersson inner product (see Section [\ref=Background_section] for the definition), we have that

[formula]

for appropriate choice of fi. Using the fact that 〈fi,fi〉,〈gj,gj〉 are multiples of special values of L-functions, we obtain a lower bound on 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉 of the form

[formula]

for some function h. Therefore, we require an upper bound on 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉, which involves bounding several integrals. Bounding the integrals requires upper bounds on the coefficients of Fk,m when Fk,m is acted on by various matrices in [formula]. By using the generating function for Fk,m given in [\cite=GJ], we obtain bounds of the form

[formula]

with c1,c2 > 0 and [formula]. While these bounds are poor, they are sufficient to obtain a reasonable upper bound on 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉.

In addition to cusp forms, we also study the coefficients of weight zero modular functions for Γ0(2). In general, the coefficients of modular functions grow much faster than the coefficients of cusp forms. The classical example of a modular function is the j-function, which is modular of weight zero for [formula]. The j-function has a Fourier expansion of the form

[formula]

with the c(n) positive integers. Petersson [\cite=Pet2] and Rademacher [\cite=Rad] independently obtained an asymptotic formula for c(n). They found that

[formula]

Since the coefficients of cusp forms are [formula], we see that the coefficients of j dwarf the coefficients of any cusp form when n is large.

The asymptotic formula ([\ref=j_coeff_asymp]) gives the true order of magnitude of c(n), but often we are interested in explicit upper bounds as well. In 1975 Hermann [\cite=Her] established that

[formula]

while the state-of-the-art result of Brisebarre and Philibert [\cite=BP] yields the asymptotically sharp bound

[formula]

The proof of ([\ref=Jenkins_Rouse_Thm]) makes use of ([\ref=BP_j_bound]) to bound the tails of certain infinite series. Similarly, our proof of Theorem [\ref=Main_Theorem] requires bounds on the coefficients of certain modular functions for Γ0(2). These modular functions are actually Hauptmoduln for Γ0(2) (see Section [\ref=Background_section]). We denote these modular functions by ψ and φ, defined as

[formula]

Here the s(n) and b(n) are integers, and one can show the b(n) are positive. Our next theorem gives asymptotic formulas for |s(n)| and b(n) as n  →    ∞  , similar to ([\ref=j_coeff_asymp]).

Let s(n) and b(n) be given as above. Then

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  .

This theorem supports the general principle that the coefficients of modular functions are large. The proof is straightforward, relying on a result of Dewar and Murty [\cite=DM].

Our last theorem is an explicit upper bound on |s(n)| and b(n).

Let s(n) and b(n) be given as above. Then

[formula]

for n  ≥  1.

By comparison with Theorem [\ref=asymp_for_Hauptmods] we see these bounds may be improved, but the bounds suffice for our purposes. The proof of this theorem is elementary, using only an explicit bound on the number of partitions of an integer into distinct parts. Indeed, interpreted appropriately, the proof of Theorem [\ref=bounds_for_Hauptmods] gives explicit upper bounds for r-colored partitions of n into distinct parts, with r = 2,4,8,16,24 (see [\cite=EO] for definitions).

The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section [\ref=Background_section] covers necessary background material about modular forms. In Section [\ref=Hauptmod_section] we prove Theorems [\ref=asymp_for_Hauptmods] and [\ref=bounds_for_Hauptmods]. In Section [\ref=L-fn_section] we prove some necessary lemmas about L-functions. We derive an upper bound for 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉 in Section [\ref=Petersson_upp_bound_section], and in Section [\ref=proof_of_main_thm_section] we prove Theorem [\ref=Main_Theorem].

Background

Here we give some necessary background and definitions about modular forms (see e.g. section 2 of [\cite=Rou2]). We let [formula] denote the complex upper half-plane. For a positive integer N  ≥  1 define

[formula]

We let Sk(N) denote the finite-dimensional [formula]-vector space of cusp forms of weight k for Γ0(N).

If f is a modular form of weight k for some Γ0(N) and

[formula]

we define the slash operator f|α by

[formula]

Here we follow the notation of [\cite=Rou2]. Note that some authors replace the exponent [formula] by k - 1. For a positive integer d we also define the operator Vd by

[formula]

It is well-known that Vd maps Sk(N) to Sk(dN). We further have the usual Hecke operator Tp, defined for [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] if [formula]. Hecke operators for p|N are defined differently. The Hecke operators preserve Sk(N).

If f,g∈Sk(N), we define their Petersson inner product 〈f,g〉 by

[formula]

The integration takes place over a fundamental domain for Γ0(N), and the Petersson inner product is well-defined with respect to choice of fundamental domain (equivalently, a choice of coset representatives for Γ0(N) in [formula]). Additionally, if [formula] with positive determinant, then 〈f|α,g|α〉  =  〈f,g〉.

The space of oldforms of Sk(N) is the space spanned by all forms

[formula]

and we have M|N,M < N and d is a divisor of [formula]. We define [formula] to be the orthogonal complement of the oldforms in Sk(N) with respect to the Petersson inner product. A newform of level N is a form

[formula]

that is a simultaneous eigenform of all the Hecke operators Tp, normalized with a(1) = 1. It is a well-known property of newforms that if f1  ≠  f2 are newforms, then

[formula]

Lastly we must define some modular forms. We let η(z) be the usual Dedekind eta function

[formula]

A Hauptmodul (plural Hauptmoduln) for a subgroup [formula] is a modular function f so that the field of all modular functions for Γ is [formula]. We define the Hauptmoduln ψ,φ for Γ0(2) by

[formula]

We note that ψ(z) has a pole at infinity and vanishes at zero, while φ(z) has a pole at zero and vanishes at infinity.

Let Ek denote the usual Eisenstein series of weight k for [formula]. Thus

[formula]

with Bk denoting the kth Bernoulli number. We define modular forms S4 and F2 for Γ0(2) by

[formula]

Note that S4 is modular for Γ0(2) of weight 4, and F2 is modular for Γ0(2) of weight 2. The generating function for Fk,m involves both S4 and F2, as well as ψ (see ([\ref=Gen_Func_for_Fkm]) in Section [\ref=Petersson_upp_bound_section]).

Hauptmodul Coefficients

In this section we prove asymptotics for the coefficients of ψ and φ, and also explicit upper bounds on the absolute values of their coefficients.

We begin by finding asymptotic formulas for the coefficients. The key ingredient is the following theorem due to Dewar and Murty (Theorem 2, [\cite=DM]).

Suppose

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula] and A,B,cf,cg  >  0. Then for [formula] we have

[formula]

We first consider the coefficients s(n) of ψ. To see that the s(n) are all integers, note that

[formula]

If we define k(z) by

[formula]

then by examining [formula] in two different ways, we see that ( - 1)n + 1s(n) is a positive integer.

In view of Theorem [\ref=DM_asymp_thm] we must get an asymptotic formula for g(n). It is not difficult to see that

[formula]

The function g(n) is studied in [\cite=Hag], where it is shown that

[formula]

The first part of Theorem [\ref=asymp_for_Hauptmods] now follows by applying Theorem [\ref=DM_asymp_thm] repeatedly (note that dividing by q does not change the asymptotic).

Now we turn to the coefficients of φ. We easily see from its definition that φ has positive integral coefficients, since

[formula]

We recognize

[formula]

as the generating function for Q(n), the number of partitions of n into distinct parts. An asymptotic formula for Q(n) is given by

[formula]

as found, for example, in equation 4 of [\cite=Bi]. Again applying Theorem [\ref=DM_asymp_thm] repeatedly, we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=asymp_for_Hauptmods]. Using this same method one can establish by induction asymptotic formulas for coefficients of powers of ψ and φ.

It remains to prove Theorem [\ref=bounds_for_Hauptmods]. Define coefficients Qk(n) by

[formula]

and note that Qk(0) = 1. Observe that |g(n)| is less than the number of partitions of n into distinct parts. Thus to get upper bounds on |s(n)| and b(n) it suffices to get an upper bound on Q24(n) and then determine the effect of dividing or multiplying by q.

Corollary 2 of [\cite=Bi] shows that

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Consider the sum

[formula]

with x,t real numbers and x < t. Applying partial summation in the usual way and simplifying,

[formula]

Setting x = n - 1,t = n, we get

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

if n  ≥  10. We proceed similarly with Q4(n), obtaining

[formula]

Continuing in this manner we get

[formula]

Adjusting for multiplication or division by q and doing a manual check for 1  ≤  n  ≤  10, we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=bounds_for_Hauptmods].

It is natural to ask whether our elementary methods give similar results for Hauptmoduln of higher levels (particularly levels 3, 5, and 7). Suitable modifications of our arguments will give explicit, but weak, upper bounds. Tighter bounds require bounds on restricted integer partitions. On the other hand, obtaining asymptotic formulas via our method seems difficult. For example, consider using our method to obtain an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of the level 3 analogue of ψ. We find that we would need an asymptotic formula for the absolute value of

[formula]

We would also need a similar asymptotic formula for parts that are 2 mod 3. As the level increases the restricted partitions become more complex, hence an extension of our method to higher levels appears nontrivial. The circle method or other more advanced techniques likely yield satisfactory results (e.g. compare ([\ref=j_coeff_asymp]) and the main theorem of [\cite=Rad]).

L-function Calculations

The goal of this section is to derive a lower bound on the L-function special value [formula] (see below for definitions), where g∈Sk(2) is a newform. We proceed in slightly more generality, treating [formula], for p∈{2,3,5,7}. We are interested in the special value [formula] because of the well-known identity

[formula]

If g∈Sk(p) has coefficients {a(n)}∞n = 1, then we define the normalized L-function of g to be

[formula]

where [formula] and αqβq  =  1 for q  ≠  p, and we allow αp or βp to be zero. The symmetric square L-function [formula] associated to g is then given by

[formula]

see Section 3 of [\cite=CM] for the computation of these local factors. The symmetric square L-function is known by the work of Gelbart and Jacquet [\cite=GeJa] to be the L-function of a cuspidal automorphic representation on [formula], hence is entire and has a functional equation of the usual form: if we set

[formula]

then we have the functional equation

[formula]

Our first step toward obtaining a lower bound on [formula] is to show that [formula] has no Siegel zeros.

Let [formula], with p∈{2,3,5,7}. Then

[formula]

for real s with [formula].

Here we follow [\cite=Rou1] and [\cite=KR], which are based on an argument of Goldfeld, Hoffstein, and Lieman [\cite=HL].

Consider the function

[formula]

where [formula] is given by

[formula]

and αq,βq as above (as with the symmetric square L-function, see [\cite=CM] for further details). Kim [\cite=Kim] proved that [formula] is associated to an automorphic representation on [formula], so [formula] has an analytic continuation and functional equation of the usual type.

From the above remarks it follows that L(s) has a functional equation and is analytic except for a pole at s = 1. Define Λ(s) = s2(1 - s)2G(s)L(s), where

[formula]

Then Λ(s) = Λ(1 - s). For the duration of the proof we take s real and greater than 1. As Λ(s) is an entire function of order 1, it admits a Hadamard product factorization

[formula]

where A,B are constants and the product is over all zeros ρ of Λ(s). Taking the logarithmic derivative, we have

[formula]

Since s > 1, we have L(s) > 0 and L'(s) < 0, and hence [formula]. Now we take the real part of both sides and use the fact that [formula] (Theorem 5.6 in [\cite=IK]). Therefore

[formula]

Define [formula] (the notational conflict with the Hauptmodul ψ is unfortunate, but both notations are standard). Then

[formula]

Now set s = 1 + α with [formula] to be chosen shortly. With p∈{2,3,5,7} and the restriction on s, we have that [formula], since Ψ(s)  ≤   log s for s  ≥  1. Now assume β is a real zero of [formula]. Then

[formula]

Choosing the optimum value of [formula], which is always less than 1 / 2, completes the proof.

We use the above lemma to get a lower bound on [formula], following Rouse [\cite=Rou1] and an argument of Hoffstein [\cite=Hof].

Let k be an even integer with k  ≥  8, and let p∈{2,3,5,7}. If g is a normalized newform in [formula] then

[formula]

We have the Rankin-Selberg convolution L-function

[formula]

Obviously [formula] has a functional equation since both ζ(s) and [formula] do. By checking Euler factors one may show that a(n)  ≥  0 and a(n2)  ≥  1 for all n. Let [formula], and note that [formula]. Set x = kA, where A is a parameter to be chosen at the end of the proof (in the end we will set [formula]). Consider the integral

[formula]

We use the fact that

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

We take only those terms with [formula], giving

[formula]

Let [formula]. We shift the contour in I to α, and thereby pick up poles at s = 1 - β, s = 0, and s =  - 2. By the Residue Theorem, we have

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=ZeroFreeRegionLemma] shows that [formula] has no real zeros to the right of β, so [formula]. As ζ(β) < 0, we see that [formula]. Similarly, we have that [formula] and ζ( - 2 + β) < 0, so [formula]. Thus, we have

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

We require an upper bound |I2|. Using the functional equations for [formula] and Γ(s) we have

[formula]

Recall that [formula]. We have the bounds

[formula]

and

[formula]

Together this gives

[formula]

By ([\ref=CentralLowerValueInequality]), this gives

[formula]

Choosing [formula] completes the proof.

Petersson Norm Upper Bounds

Recall the notation from the introduction. We write [formula] where k'∈{0,2}. The dimension of Sk(2) is [formula]. There is a basis for Sk(2) indexed by m given by

[formula]

In this section we obtain an upper bound on 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉. The Fk,m have the following generating function (Section 6 of [\cite=GJ]):

[formula]

Recall that S4 and F2 were defined in Section [\ref=Background_section]. We set F0(z)  =  1. Integrating the generating function gives an integral representation of Fk,m(z), namely

[formula]

where τ  =  u + iv and v is a fixed constant to be chosen later. Here we are not free to take v arbitrarily. We require v to be positive and large enough such that it corresponds (under a change of variables) to a circle around q = 0 that avoids poles in the integrand of ([\ref=Gen_Func_for_Fkm]); see the beginning of Section 3 in [\cite=JR] for similar discussion.

To compute the inner product 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉, we first need coset representatives of Γ0(2) in [formula]. The index of Γ0(2) in [formula] is 3, and we choose the coset representatives

[formula]

Recall that the Petersson inner product is well-defined with respect to choice of coset representatives. If F denotes the usual fundamental domain for [formula], then

[formula]

(The presence of yk - 2 in each integral is to ensure certain invariance properties are satisfied.) To get an upper bound on 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉 we study Fk,m|α- 1i. In particular, the Fourier expansion of Fk,m changes when Fk,m is acted on by these matrices, and we require upper bounds on the absolute values of these coefficients. The generating function representation of Fk,m is key to this step. From the definition of the slash operator and the theory of Fourier expansions of modular forms, we have

[formula]

We write A(i)k(m,n) to denote the dependence on αi. Note that A(1)k(m,n)  =  Ak(m,n).

To get upper bounds on |A(i)k(m,n)| we determine how replacing z by [formula] or [formula] changes the integral representation of Fk,m. First consider [formula]. Recall that η(z) satisfies

[formula]

Since ψ is an eta quotient this implies

[formula]

Transformation properties of Eisenstein series easily imply that

[formula]

Next consider [formula]. To compute [formula] we use, in addition to the transformation law above, the fact that

[formula]

Standard computations then show that

[formula]

By definition,

[formula]

and a straightforward calculation shows that

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

We see that [formula] corresponds to the matrix [formula] acting on z. Certainly

[formula]

so if we set [formula] we have

[formula]

since

[formula]

Putting this all together gives

[formula]

We do a similar calculation with [formula] and find that

[formula]

Putting everything together yields the required generating functions:

[formula]

We write z = x + iy, where we take y a constant to be fixed soon. The coefficients A(i)k(m,n) are then given by

[formula]

To get upper bounds on |A(i)k(m,n)| it suffices to bound the appropriate double integrals. For the remainder of the section, we set v  =  1.16 and y  =  .865, so that τ  =  u + 1.16i,z  =  x + .865i, where u,x∈[ -  1  /  2,1  /  2]. This choice of v,y is identical to that in [\cite=JR]. These values of v and y give reasonable bounds, and keep the difference of Hauptmoduln in the denominator of ([\ref=Gen_Func_for_Fkm]) far enough from zero. Further, in bounding 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉 we require certain infinite series to be convergent, and choosing y to be just less than [formula] makes this possible.

We handle each A(i)k(m,n) in turn. For a modular form [formula], we write [formula], and write RG  =  G -  (we also refer to RG as the tail of the series). Throughout the calculations we understand N to be equal to 100. All computations were performed using SAGE [\cite=SAGE] and Mathematica [\cite=Math]. (See Section 5 of [\cite=GJ] for computations of a similar nature.)

Upper Bound on |A(1)k(m,n)|

We have

[formula]

Trivially bounding, we have

[formula]

We find the appropriate upper and lower bounds on each piece separately, and then combine the bounds after all the calculations.

The Fourier expansion of F2(z) is given by

[formula]

It is clear that we have

[formula]

To bound RF2, we have

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

where we have used the technique of taking derivatives of geometric series to evaluate the sum. (Hereafter we do not mention the contribution of tails of series, since our choice of N lets us easily show the tails are always negligible). Hence

[formula]

We similarly find that

[formula]

The next task is getting a lower bound on |S4(τ)|. First, we take the derivative of S4(τ) to get

[formula]

from which it follows that

[formula]

We evaluate (τ) at the points [formula] for n∈[ -  10000,10000] and find that the minimum absolute value at these points is greater than 0.000679. Hence the smallest possible value of |(τ)| is given by

[formula]

Subtracting off the tail, we see that

[formula]

It remains to handle ψ(z) and ψ(τ). Taking the derivative, we have

[formula]

and from this we get

[formula]

The first sum is finite, and we can evaluate it directly, getting

[formula]

For the infinite sum, we can bound |s(n)| using Theorem [\ref=bounds_for_Hauptmods]. Thus we have

[formula]

We bound the exponent by

[formula]

and summing the series we find that as usual the tail is negligible. It follows that

[formula]

As above, we now calculate |ψ̃(z)| on a grid of points. We look at points with [formula]. We find that that maximum value on this point sample is given by 254.52626, and thus we have

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

We similarly compute a lower bound for |ψ(τ)|, finding that

[formula]

We now pull all the computations above together to get

[formula]

Upper Bound on |A(2)k(m,n)|

Here we have

[formula]

We have already bounded everything involving τ, so we only need to bound the parts involving z. The bound on |z| is straightforward, since

[formula]

Using this and arguing as above we find that

[formula]

Getting an upper bound on [formula] is entirely analogous to the calculations we have done before. We derive the bound

[formula]

Combining everything from above, we have

[formula]

Upper Bound on |A(3)k(m,n)|

From equations above we have that

[formula]

We first get a bound for [formula]. As usual, we bound its derivative, compute values of the truncated sum on a grid of points, and compensate for the effects of the derivative and the tail of the series. This gives

[formula]

Arguing similarly for [formula], we find that

[formula]

It remains to deal with φ(z) and [formula]. Again the computations are routine, and we have

[formula]

From our bounds above, we have

[formula]

Now we are in a position to get an upper bound on 〈Fk,m,Fk,m〉. We have

[formula]

We bound each of I1,I2,I3 separately.

Upper Bound on I1

In this integral we act on Fk,m with α- 11, which is just the identity matrix. We write

[formula]

and putting this in the integral and integrating over x, we get

[formula]

Changing variables, we find that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and it is easy to see that the function

[formula]

is decreasing as a function of n, so

[formula]

Using ([\ref=Coeff_Bound_for_A1]) gives

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Upper Bound on I2

Here we act on Fk,m with α- 12, and thus

[formula]

Putting this into the integral and rearranging, we have

[formula]

We easily obtain

[formula]

and ([\ref=Coeff_Bound_for_A2]) yields

[formula]

It remains to bound the double sum. Since r,s are positive integers, we have

[formula]

so the double sum is bounded above by

[formula]

We explicitly calculate the partial sum with 10000 terms and then bound the contribution of the tail, which gives

[formula]

Putting everything together, we obtain

[formula]

Upper Bound on I3

We have

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=Coeff_Bound_for_A3]) and proceeding as before, we have

[formula]

Putting everything together and simplifying, we have

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Main_Theorem]

Let n = n(k) be the dimension of [formula] and let t  =  t(k) be the dimension of [formula]. Let {fi}ni = 1 be a basis of normalized Hecke eigenforms for [formula], and let {gj}tj = 1 be a basis of normalized newforms for [formula]. We would like to write Fk,m as a linear combination of fi,fi|V2, and gj (i.e. in terms of oldforms and newforms). Directly writing

[formula]

with constants ci,di,ej leads to problems, so we write Fk,m with respect to a different basis.

To motivate our choice of basis we require some results on Petersson inner products. Specifically, we need to be able to evaluate 〈fi|V2,fj|V2〉 and 〈fi,fj|V2〉. We define a matrix M by

[formula]

Let fi,fj be eigenforms in [formula]. Then

[formula]

This implies 〈fi|V2,fj|V2〉  =  0 if i  ≠  j. Further, from Lemma 5 of [\cite=Rou2] we have that

[formula]

where ai(2) is the coefficient of q2 in the Fourier expansion of fi. Note that ai(2) is real since fi is a Hecke eigenform. An easy modification of the proof of this lemma shows that 〈fi,fj|V2〉 = 0 if i  ≠  j.

We would like to write Fk,m with respect to a basis in which the forms are all orthogonal to each other with respect to the Petersson inner product, the nth coefficient of a basis element is bounded by [formula] for some absolute constant C  ≥  1, and the Petersson norm of each basis element is about the same order of magnitude. Using a basis of this form was suggested to us by Rouse (private communication). We choose our basis to consist of the forms {gj}tj = 1,{fi|V2}ni = 1,{fi  -  κifi|V2}ni = 1, where κi is chosen so that fi  -  κifi|V2 is orthogonal to fi|V2. An easy calculation shows that [formula]. Now we write

[formula]

Note that we may take [formula] because Fk,m,fi,gj have real coefficients. Since the basis elements are orthogonal to each other we have

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

where for the inequality we have used [formula]. From work of Rouse [\cite=Rou1] we have the inequality

[formula]

and from Lemma [\ref=Newform_Lower_Bound] we have the inequality

[formula]

Taking these inequalities we see that

[formula]

This obviously implies that

[formula]

Recall that n is the dimension of [formula] and t is the dimension of [formula]. We have [formula], and specializing Theorem 1 of [\cite=Mar] gives

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

[formula]

Using the triangle inequality and ([\ref=Upper_Bound_on_Inner_Product]) we obtain

[formula]

We must determine the absolute constant C  ≥  1 such that the nth coefficients of gj,2k / 2fi|V2, and fi  -  κifi|V2 are bounded above by [formula]. The gj are newforms so their coefficients are bounded above by [formula]. Let fi be as above with Fourier expansion given by

[formula]

Then [formula], so the 2nth coefficient of 2k / 2fi|V2 is bounded above by

[formula]

Arguing similarly, we see that the coefficients of fi  -  κifi|V2 are bounded above by [formula]. Hence we may take [formula]. This implies that the absolute value of the coefficient of qn in Fk,m is bounded above by

[formula]

Now define B(k) by

[formula]

so that the nth coefficient of Fk,m is bounded above in absolute value by

[formula]

Let G∈Sk(2) be given by

[formula]

Applying the triangle inequality gives

[formula]

which yields Theorem [\ref=Main_Theorem].
