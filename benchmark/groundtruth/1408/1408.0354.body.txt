Probing the Galactic center with X-ray polarimetry

Introduction

Using the ART-P telescope on-board of Granat, [\citet=Sunyaev1993] were the first to image the Galactic center (GC) from the soft (2.5 keV) to the hard (22 keV) X-ray band. The discovery of a source characterized by a spherical morphology in the soft band, and by an extended (i.e. elongated along the Galactic plane) shape in the hard X-ray range, lead [\citet=Sunyaev1993] to suggest that part of the hard X-ray emission could be due to Compton-scattered photons originating from a nearby compact source and reprocessed by dense molecular clouds. Later, X-ray images and spectra of the GC obtained by [\citet=Koyama1996], using the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), revealed fluorescent Kα emission lines from cold iron atoms in Sgr B2. Associated with a hard X-ray spectral slope, [\citet=Koyama1996] estimated that the diffuse thermal emission could be due to a past intense irradiation from Sgr A*, the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) that lies in the GC. Such an argument is in agreement with the predictions of [\citet=Sunyaev1993] and further detections from other extended gas cloudlets tend to corroborate this idea. In particular, [\citet=Murakami2001] presented the first ASCA evidence of diffuse hard X-ray emission associated with strong 6.4 keV fluorescence line and large absorption from the Sgr C complex. Hard X-ray continuum and Fe Kα emission have also been found in several other GC molecular clouds: Sgr B1 [\citep=Koyama2007], M0.74-0.09 [\citep=Koyama2007], G0.11-0.11 [\citep=Ponti2010], M0.74-0.09 [\citep=Nobukawa2011], M1 and M2 [\citep=Ponti2010], the Arches cluster [\citep=Yusef-Zadeh2002] and the molecular complex called the Bridge [\citep=Bamba2002].

To uncover the nature of the hot diffuse X-ray emission and test the hypothesis of the flaring theory, [\citet=Churazov2002] postulated that an X-ray mission equipped with a state-of-the-art polarimeter would be necessary. Indeed, if past radiation from Sgr A* is reprocessed by extended, distant reflection nebulae, the resulting X-ray emission should be polarized. In order to lay the groundwork for a future polarimetric explorer, several studies have been done [\citep=Churazov2002] [\citep=Matt2010] [\citep=Marin2014], estimating the polarization degree and the orientation of the polarization position angle that a potential mission could detect. Hence, in this research note, we summarize the work accomplished so far to evaluate the net X-ray polarization emerging from the largest and brightest (i.e. easier to detect) GC molecular clouds.

Evaluating the polarization emerging from the GC

So far, there have been two main publications exploring the resulting X-ray polarization emerging from the GC. The first one, from [\citet=Churazov2002], focused on the reprocessing molecular cloud Sgr B2 and estimated the net soft X-ray polarization signature of this cloud. The second paper, by [\citet=Marin2014], modeled the 2[formula]2[formula] (~   288~    ×    ~  288 pc; at 8.5 kpc 1[formula] ≈   0.04 pc) central region of the Milky Way at energies higher than 8 keV and included polarization maps. We now review the main results from the two complementary publications.

Sgr B2 in the soft X-ray band

[\citet=Churazov2002] investigated the polarization emerging from a single cloud of radius 10 pc representative of the reflection nebulae Sgr B2. In their simulation, the spherical gaseous medium was filled with neutral, solar abundance matter and had a Thomson optical depth of 0.5. It was irradiated by a steady beam of unpolarized photons with energy ranging from 2 to 8 keV. Photoelectric absorption, fluorescent emission and Compton scattering by bound electrons were included and the molecular cloud was located at 100 pc from the continuum source, which is representative of the known projected distance from Sgr A* [\citep=Murakami2001]. However, since the three-dimensional parametrization of the GC is unknown, the reflecting nebula can be shifted from the Galactic plane but still conserve the same radial projections. To investigate this effect, [\citet=Churazov2002] located their cloud model at two different positions: at the same distance and 100 pc away from the observer than the emitting region.

Their work is summarized in Fig. [\ref=Fig:Churazov] and the general result is that the reflected radiation should be highly polarized (>   30%) with a direction of polarization normal to the scattering plane. The amount of P is a function of the three-dimensional position of the cloud, decreasing when Sgr B2 departs from the Galactic plane. Local dilution of the polarization degree by fluorescent photons (being unpolarized) is symptomatic of the composition of the cloud, and the slow but steady decrease of P with energy is due to multiple scatterings.

Thus, using a simple model, [\citet=Churazov2002] proved that any detection of polarized X-ray emission from the reflection nebulae around Sgr A* would give constraints on the morphology, composition and position of the scattering clouds.

Broadband GC polarization imaging

The results obtained by [\citet=Churazov2002] are valid in the 2 - 8 keV band for small hydrogen column densities (nH ~  <  1022 ~cm- 2). At larger nH, the emission below 5 keV is expected to be highly suppressed. In addition to that, past X-ray observations [\citep=Koyama1986] [\citep=Koyama1989] revealed the presence of a diffuse plasma emission toward the GC that may additionally dilute the polarization signal below 7 keV. Hence, to avoid most of the dilution by the GC plasma emission and extend the soft X-ray simulations achieved by [\citet=Churazov2002], 8 - 35 keV modeling has been undertaken by [\citet=Marin2014].

In our recent work, [\citet=Marin2014] took into account the dense and warm environment around the central few parsecs around Sgr A* (known as the circumnuclear disc, CND); a cold dusty structure in the shape of a continuous chain of irregular clumps representative of the central molecular zone (CMZ, [\citealt=Molinari2011]); the two bright, complex reflection nebulae Sgr B2 and Sgr C (located at the two extrema of the CMZ); and a continuum source displaced by ~   22 pc in projection from the center of the model toward the Western galactic longitude (to be consistent with the shifted gas distribution within the CMZ [\citep=Molinari2011].

The polarization map presented in Fig. [\ref=Fig:Marin] is extracted from [\citet=Marin2014]. It is found that the polarized flux, PF / F  *, traces the overall shape of the GC, emphasizing the ∞  -shaped CMZ. PF / F  * reaches a maximum at the location of the non-axisymmetric CND surrounding Sgr A*, but the local, integrated P is low (~   1.0%). Sgr B2 and Sgr C show the secondary, brightest polarized flux knots of the map, associated with P = 66.5% for Sgr B2 and P = 47.8% for Sgr C. The difference in P is due to the asymmetrical spatial location of the cloud with respect to Sgr A*. Both the clouds present a polarization position angle ψ perpendicular to the vertical axis of the model (normal to the scattering plane). P is found to vary for each CMZ cloud and reaches a maximum for the Eastern and Western sections of the elliptical twisted ring but it is most likely that a large fraction of the ∞  -shaped ring will be diluted by background, unpolarized emission from both plasma emission and Sgr A*. Finally, when integrating the whole 2[formula]2[formula] GC polarized emission, the model produces a net polarization degree of 0.9% associated with ψ = -22.8[formula]. The combined emission from Sgr A* and the CND thus dominates the whole polarization picture.

[\citet=Marin2014] extended the modeling of [\citet=Churazov2002] by radiatively coupling the primary source to a large panel of reprocessing targets. They also extend their cloud parametrization to explore the influence of the location of the scattering nebulae on polarization (not shown in this research note), finding that the two reflection nebulae always produce high polarization degrees (≫   10%).

The need for a dedicated X-ray polarimetry mission

It has been shown by [\citet=Churazov2002] and [\citet=Marin2014] that the GC is expected to provide a variety of polarization signals where maximum P is expected to arise from reflection nebulae. [\citet=Marin2014] also computed the minimum detectable polarization (MDP) that the NHXM (New Hard X-ray Mission, [\citealt=Tagliaferri2012a] [\citealt=Tagliaferri2012b]) could have reached and found that such polarization levels are detectable using a 500 ks observation. Errors on ψ being marginal, the detection of ψ normal to the scattering plane would be unambiguous.

Was the GC active a few hundreds years ago? X-ray polarimetry can definitively prove or reject this hypothesis since the main molecular clouds should be highly polarized (≫   10%) with the electric vector perpendicular to the line connecting Sgr A* to the reprocessing nebula. To spatially constrain the three-dimensional location of each GC component with respect to the central SMBH, it will be necessary to observe at least two molecular clouds. An X-ray mission equipped with a polarization imaging detector, such as the Gas Pixel Detector (GPD) based on the photoelectric effect [\citep=Costa2001], is ideally suited since polarization mapping would reveal the complex morphology of the GC, spatially resolving the largest reflection nebulae, differentiating them from neighborhood sources and potentially enabling the investigation of stratified light echoes from the past activity of Sgr A*.

A dedicated space mission for imaging X-ray polarimetry such as the non-selected projects NHXM or IXPE (the Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer, [\citealt=Weisskopf2008]) would have been sufficiently sensitive to measure the polarization emerging from the 2[formula]2[formula] GC, even below 8 keV where plasma emission is acting like an unpolarized background and can be further substracted from past spectral data. Finally, X-ray polarization measurement would ultimately test the alternative scenario for the origin of X-ray emission from Sgr B2 and Sgr C in which X-ray features are produced by low-energy cosmic-ray electrons rather than by Compton scattering.
