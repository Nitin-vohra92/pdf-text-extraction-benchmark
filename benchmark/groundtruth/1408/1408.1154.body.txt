The set up

The purpose of these notes is to explore a topological application of an averaging principle for foliated stochastic flows, as established in Gargate and Ruffino [\cite=Gargate-Ruffino]. Our geometrical setting is a foliation of a tubular neighbourhood of an embedded compact boundaryless submanifold M of [formula] consisting on diffeomorphic copies of M. Precisely, consider a tubular neighbourhood U of M and a diffeomorphism φ:U  →  M  ×  ( - a,a) such that each [formula] generates a leaf φ- 1(M  ×  {s}) which is diffeomorphic to M = φ- 1(M  ×  {0}). The diffeomorphism φ is taken such that transversal component [formula] is orthogonal to the leaves, pointing outwards.

The main idea of this application is to consider an unperturbed system whose trajectories stay, each one, in a unique leaf and are Brownian motions on its corresponding leaf. This structure consisting of simultaneous Brownian motions on each leaf is called a foliated Brownian motion, see e.g. the seminal article by L. Garnett [\cite=Garnett] or more recently Catuogno, Ledesma and Ruffino [\cite=CRL-Trans], [\cite=CRL-Embedded]. We destroy this foliated behaviour of trajectories introducing a perturbing vector field orthogonal to the leaves such that at each point, this vector field is given by the Gaussian curvature of the corresponding leaf, pointing outwards for positive curvature. Putting together the results on the averaging principle, [\cite=Gargate-Ruffino], for this particular foliated system and the classical Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we have that, in the average, the transversal behaviour of the perturbed system, with time rescaled by [formula], approaches a deterministic ODE with constant coefficient proportional to the Euler characteristic of the original submanifold M, as ε goes to zero. An estimate of the rate of convergence can be obtained.

In the next paragraphs we recall some of the results we are going to use on averaging stochastic flows in foliated spaces.

Previous results on averaging in foliated spaces

We recall the main results in [\cite=Gargate-Ruffino] which are relevant here. Let N be a smooth Riemannian manifold with an n-dimensional smooth foliation, i.e. N is endowed with an integrable regular distribution of dimension n, hence N is decomposed in a disjoint union of immersed submanifolds. For a precise definition and further properties of foliated spaces in more general settings see e.g. the initial chapters of Tondeur [\cite=Tondeur], Walcak [\cite=Walcak], among others. We denote by Lx the leaf of the foliation passing through a point x∈N. We assume that the leaves are compact and that given an initial condition x0, the leaf Lx0 has a tubular neighbourhood U  ⊂  N such that there exists a diffeomorphism φ:U  →  Lx0  ×  V, where [formula] is a connected open set containing the origin. For simplicity, the second (vertical) coordinate of a point x∈U is called the vertical projection p(x)∈V, i.e. φ(x) = (u,π(x)) for some u∈Lx. Hence for any fixed v∈V, the inverse image p- 1(v) is a compact leaf Lx, where x is any point in U such that the vertical projection p(x) = v. In coordinates, we denote

[formula]

for any x∈U.

Consider an SDE in M whose associated stochastic flow preserves the foliation, i.e. we consider a Stratonovich equation

[formula]

where the smooth vector fields Xk are foliated in the sense that Xk(x)∈TxLx, for [formula]. Here [formula] is a standard Brownian motion in [formula] with respect to a filtered probability space [formula]. For an initial condition x0, the trajectories of the solution xt in this case lay on the leaf Lx0 a.s.. Moreover, there exists a (local) stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms Ft:N  →  N which restricted to the initial leaf is a flow in the compact submanifold Lx0.

We introduce a perturbing smooth vector field K in the system such that this vector field destroys the foliated structure of the trajectories. We denote the perturbed system by xεt which satisfies the SDE

[formula]

with the same initial condition xε0 = x0.

For each vertical coordinate [formula], we denote by Qi(v) the ergodic average of the i-th component of the perturbing vector field K in the corresponding leaf p- 1(v). Hence, by the ergodic theorem

[formula]

for μv-almost every point x in the leaf p- 1(v); here Dxpi is the derivative of pi at the point x and μv denotes an invariant measure on p- 1(v) which we assume uniquely ergodic. Denote by η(t) an estimate of the rate of convergence of the ergodic limit in Lp for the functions Qi(v). Hence η(t) tends to zero when t goes to infinity. In general, there is no optimal rate of convergence, see e.g. Kakutani-Petersen [\cite=Kakutani-Petersen], Krengel [\cite=Krengel] and an explicit example of continuous system in the averaging context in [\cite=Gargate-Ruffino].

We assume that the averaging functions of the perturbing vector field [formula] are Lipschitz continuous for [formula]. This hypothesis holds naturally if the invariant measures μv for the unperturbed foliated system has a sort of weakly continuity on v. For example, for nondegenerate systems on the leaves, this condition is naturally satisfied.

Consider the following ODE on the vertical space V:

[formula]

with initial condition p(x0) = 0. Let T0 be the time that the solution v(t) hits the boundary ∂V. Let τε be the stopping time given by the exit time of the perturbed system xεt from the coordinate neighbourhood U  ⊂  M.

An averaging principle in this context is established by the theorem below which says that the transversal behaviour of [formula] can be approximated in the average by an ordinary differential equation in the transversal space whose coefficients are given by the average of the transversal component of the perturbation K with respect to the invariant measure on the leaves for the original dynamics of equation ([\ref=eq_original]), when ε decreases to zero. The rate of converge is given below:

Assuming Lipschitz continuity of the averaging functions [formula] for [formula] we have:

where η(t) is the rate of convergence in Lq of the ergodic averages of the unperturbed trajectories on the leaves.

The exit times of the two systems satisfy the estimates

Item (b) of the theorem above guarantees robustness of the result. For the proof of the theorem above see [\cite=Gargate-Ruffino]; further extension to Lévy processes has been done in [\cite=Hoegele-Ruffino].

Exploring the topology of the leaves

We consider an unperturbed foliated dynamics in U (degenerate) which is a foliated Brownian motion. That is, for each initial condition x0∈U, the solution is a Brownian motion on the corresponding leaf Lx0. For more details and construction of this processes, see [\cite=CRL-Trans]. In our particular case of embedded manifold we can consider the dynamics generated by gradient vector fields tangent to the leaves. Precisely, at each x∈U, let Xi(x) be the orthogonal projection of ei, the i-th element of the canonical basis onto the tangent space TxLx of the leaf passing through x, for each i = 1,2,3. The vector fields X1,X2 and X3 determine the following Stratonovich stochastic equation in U:

[formula]

The corresponding stochastic flow of this equation generates a foliated Brownian motion in U, i.e. given initial conditions, the solution are simultaneous Brownian motions on each leaf of the foliation, see [\cite=CRL-Embedded].

We investigate the effective behaviour of a small transversal perturbation of order ε:

[formula]

where the transversal vector field K(x) is orthogonal to the leaves, proportional to the Gaussian curvature of the leaf Lx at the point x∈U. We assume that at a point with positive curvature, the corresponding vector field K points outwards. In some sense this equation models an average inertial or centrifugal forces acting on particles moving randomly on the leaves. We have the following averaging result which does not depend on the geometry of the manifold M:

The transversal dynamics of orthogonal perturbation, given by ε times the Gaussian curvature of foliated Brownian motion, behaves according to v(t) = 2πχ(M) t, as ε goes to zero. Here χ(M) is the Euler characteristic of the leaves.

Precisely, up to a stopping time, for q  ≥  2, β∈(0,1 / 2), ε > 0, for each t  ≥  0, there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

Proof: Most of the proof is straightforward: one just has to put the properties together and apply the classical Gauss-Bonnet theorem. In fact, the invariant measures on the leaves are the normalized Riemannian volume. According to our coordinate systems, the one dimensional transversal component is given by the Gaussian curvature K(x). The average (in the transversal direction) of the perturbing vector field K on each leaf is given by

[formula]

Hence this average depends only on the topology of the leaf.

The proof finishes as a direct application of Theorem [\ref=teoremaprincipal] with codimension d = 1. The rate of ergodic convergence on the leaves η(t), in this case, has order [formula] since the system is uniformly elliptic, as in X.-M.-Li [\cite=Li]. The estimate on the rate of convergence (inequality ([\ref=eq:rate_of_convergence])) follows directly .

As a simple example, consider an orthogonal perturbation, according to the curvature, of a Brownian motion on any manifold diffeomorphic to the torus. This system presents no transversal behaviour on the average. Indeed, a flat torus illustrates trivially this fact since [formula]. On manifolds diffeomorphic to the sphere, the orthogonal behaviour is a linear expansion. For an n-fold torus with genus n > 1, the effect is a linear contraction with coefficients proportional to 2 - 2n.
