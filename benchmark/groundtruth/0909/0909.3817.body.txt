Decelerated Spreading Processes in Degree-correlated Networks

Understanding the mechanisms of spreading phenomena is a need shared across many scientific disciplines, with examples as seemingly diverse as reaction diffusion processes, pandemics or cascading failures in electric power grids. Substantial new insights have recently been gained through the application of statistical physics on the study of large-scale networked systems, the results of which show how the underlying connectivity pattern affects the dynamical interactions among the examined elements [\cite=doro2003evolution] [\cite=Barratt:2008] [\cite=citeulike:4504463]. Going beyond characterizing the network topology with the essential degree distribution [\cite=citeulike:90557], extensive research has focused on the influence of degree-degree correlations [\cite=Barratt:2008]. The degree of a node equals to the total number of links attached to it. A network with a positive degree-degree correlation is usually called assortative, and implies that nodes with a similarly small or large degree tend to be connected to each other [\cite=Newman03thestructure] [\cite=Barratt:2008]. If, by contrast, the nodes tend to be connected to nodes with a considerably different degree, the network is called disassortative, referring to a negative degree-degree correlation. Assortativity is typically found in social networks, disassortativity in biological and technical networks [\cite=PhysRevLett.89.208701]. The impact of correlations on the dynamics appears to be non-trivial [\cite=citeulike:4131712] and has so far been discussed by analyzing specific processes only. In this respect, assortativity seems to be a suppressing factor for the spatio-temporal spreading of epidemic diseases [\cite=PhysRevE.68.035103], while at the same time disassortativity has been suggested to prevent the propagation of perturbations in protein networks [\cite=citeulike:99928] and to enhance the robustness of declining company networks [\cite=saavedra08].

In this paper, we show that many spreading processes can be categorized into two fundamentally different regimes, in which either assortativity or disassortativity has a decelerating effect. For this aim, we broadly define a spreading process as the propagation of a certain nodal state along the links of a network. The two regimes are then given by the probability of a node to respond to the current states of its neighboring (i.e. connected) nodes. In regime I the probability of adopting the propagating state is lower for nodes with a large degree than for nodes with a small degree, given that the same ratio of neighboring nodes already is in that state (see illustration in Table [\ref=tableA]). In regime II the probability is higher for nodes with a large degree. Such a connectivity dependent local response mechanism is found in existing models for various phenomena, even though they may strongly differ besides in their specific features. An example of regime I is a model for a declining company network, whereas the probability for a company disappearing is inversely proportional to its degree [\cite=saavedra08]. Hence, after loosing the same ratio of connected firms a company with a large (initial) degree has still more connections and thus a lower probability to disappear than a company with a small degree. An example of regime II is the spreading of epidemics on the worldwide air-transportation network [\cite=Colizza:2006p19304], since a highly connected city is more susceptible than a city with less connections, given that the same ratio of adjacent cities has an equally infected population. Further examples of categorizable models are listed in Table [\ref=tableA].

In order to focus on these two local response mechanisms and to analyze the regime dependent effect of degree-degree correlations on the resulting spreading dynamics, we draw upon the illustration of a decaying undirected network. The spreading is captured by a minimalistic two-state model, whereby the nodes are either fully functional or failed. Let us stipulate that a node becomes stressed as one of its neighboring nodes fails and that the stress, in turn, increases the probability that this node fails during the next time step [\cite=aging]. It is then natural to assume that the stress si on a node i increases with the ratio xi  =  kfi / ki of failed neighboring nodes kfi to the initial node degree, ki. We further assume that si  =  0 if kfi  =  0 and that the maximum stress si  =  1 is independent of the inital degree and is reached when kfi  =  ki. In order to vary the relative influence of the initial node degree we introduce the following formula for the stress si(xi):

[formula]

where θ is the response parameter. As shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig:stress] the stress equals to xi if θ  =  0. For θ  <  0 we obtain regime I, as the absolute number of functional neighboring nodes becomes more important. For example, having lost 50% of the neighbors, a node i initially with ki = 30 neighbors is less stressed than a node j with an initial degree of kj = 10. Analogously, θ  >  0 corresponds to regime II, as the absolute number of failed nearest neighbors becomes more important. For θ  ≫  0 the loss of just one neighbor causes maximum stress, independently of ki. In the limit θ  ≪  0 the stress is [formula] if 0  ≤  xi < 1, but jumps to si = 1 when all neighboring nodes have failed. It is worth remarking that Eq. ([\ref=Eq:stress]) can be replaced by other functions which qualitatively reproduce the two regimes.

Starting at time t = 0 with N0 nodes, the network decay is governed by both random (i.e. independent) and stress induced node failures, formulated by the time dependent failure rate of a node i:

[formula]

where [formula] is the life time distribution function. The parameters p  ≥  0 and q  ≥  0 account for the random failures and for the influence of the stress respectively. The relation to different classes of spreading models is given by the parameter range of Eq. ([\ref=Eq:stress]) and Eq. ([\ref=Eq:rate]). For instance, putting p  →  0 in the limit θ  ≫  0 we readily recover the susceptible-infected (SI) model as applied to study epidemics in which individuals are either in the susceptible or infected state [\cite=Anderson1992]. The proportional increase of λi, as θ = 0, corresponds to the Bass diffusion model [\cite=1245934]. A further example are binary threshold models as applied for social contagion processes [\cite=Granovetter:1978] [\cite=citeulike:1753065]; assuming a high (low) threshold these models can be approximated by setting a correspondingly low (high) value for θ at p  →  0 and a high value of q. We studied the spreading processes on finite size scale-free networks, differing in their global level of correlation. The degree distribution of scale-free networks follows a power law, [formula], which is found in many real life systems, whereas the characteristic degree exponent usually lies in the range 2  <  γ  ≤  3 [\cite=doro2003evolution]. The global level of correlation is commonly quantified by the Pearson coefficient r [\cite=pearson]. This measure is defined in the interval
