Introduction

Despite a wealth of observational data, accumulated since their discovery in 1995, there is not yet a commonly accepted model of neutron star kHz QPOs. In recent years, a lot of efforts has been devoted to studying the distribution of the observed frequencies (or frequency ratios), in an attempt to provide insights to theoretical models. This was particularly relevant for resonance based models which predicted that both the ratio of frequencies as well as the frequencies themselves should cluster around specific values. Apparent support for these models came from the observation that the ratios of simultaneous lower and upper QPO frequencies from Sco X-1 clustered around 1.5, suggestive of a 3:2 resonance mechanism [\citep=Abramowicz:2003sf]. Additional support came simultaneously from the observations of black hole high frequency QPOs associated with fixed 3/2 ratios [\cite=Remillard:2005qp]. The clustering of frequency ratios, claimed in other neutron star systems as well [\citep=Torok:2008zp], remains a controversial issue since then. In particular, the significance of the clustering presented by [\citet=Abramowicz:2003sf] was challenged by [\citet=Belloni:2005kc].

The signal to noise ratio nσ at which aperiodic variability such as a kHz QPO is detected in a photon counting experiment is approximately [\citep=1988SSRv...46..273L] [\citep=van-der-Klis:1989kn]:

[formula]

where S and B are source and background count rate, respectively, rS is the root mean squared amplitude of the variability expressed as a fraction of S, T the integration time and Δν the bandwidth of the variability. Hereafter, we will neglect B over S, because for most QPO sources, B (a few tens of counts/s/PCU, where PCU stands for PCA Unit, 5 at most, [\citet=Bradt:1993hw]) is at least a factor of 10 lower than S, which is typically several hundreds of counts/s/PCU. In equation [\ref=eq1], rS and Δν vary with frequency (ν) [\citep=2006MNRAS.370.1140B], hence nσ will depend also on ν. The frequency dependence of rS and Δν is a non monotonic function of frequency and has a different shape for the lower and upper kHz QPOs. In addition, in a given system, on average larger luminosities (hence count rates, S) correspond to larger ν [\citep=Ford:2000ad]. Actually, the situation is more complex, because of the parallel track phenomenon, which shows that ν is not uniquely determined by S, but that the spread of S over which QPOs are detected increases with frequency [\citep=van-der-Klis:2001vl]. This is illustrated in Figure 2 in [\citet=2005MNRAS.361..855B] where, in a frequency versus count rate diagram, it is mostly the left upper part of the diagram that is populated. The implications of the above are twofold. First, the integration time at which a kHz QPO is detected above a certain significance threshold will depend on frequency. Second, if T is constrained, kHz QPOs, either the lower, the upper or both may reach the significance threshold only over limited frequency ranges. This directly implies that the observed distribution of frequencies or frequency ratios will strongly depend on the way the data are considered.

When dealing with frequency distributions, two main types of analysis have been applied so far, both suffering from intrinsic biases. Methods consisting of averaging large amount of data, based on some selection criteria, e.g. spectral colors, position along a color-color diagram [\citep=jonker02], same type of QPO falling in a given frequency interval, as for the shift and add procedure [\citep=2000MNRAS.318..938M], erase the underlying distribution of frequencies and cannot be considered for this purpose. The first applicable method considers observations of similar durations. This is the case in particular when data are analyzed ObsID per ObsID, whose durations are limited by the RXTE orbital period to typically ~  2 - 3 kseconds (by definition, an ObsID corresponds to a single observation, where observation refers to a temporally contiguous collection of data from a single pointing). This method will obviously bias the distribution of frequencies or ratios at frequencies where the two QPOs can be detected simultaneously on a typical ObsID timescale. Such a method was recently applied to 4U1636-536 by [\citet=Torok:2008zp] who reported a clustering of ratios at 3/2 and possibly at 5/4, to 4U1820-303 by [\citet=2008NewAR..51..835B] who found a clustering of ratios of simultaneous twin QPOs around 4/3 and to 4U0614+091 by [\citet=2009arXiv0907.3223B]. In both studies, it was found that the distribution of ratios computed from the single lower QPO frequencies, estimating the upper QPO frequencies from their linear relationship differed from the distribution of ratios of simultaneous twin QPOs, as expected if the condition for detecting the lower QPO differed from the one for detecting the two QPOs simultaneously.

As to increase the number of detected frequencies, the second method minimizes the PDS integration time to detect one of the two QPOs (generally the lower QPO) and computes the missing frequency through the linear relationship linking the lower and upper QPO frequencies. This method will bias the distributions at frequencies where the lower QPO is easy to detect (e.g. when its RMS amplitude/quality factor reaches a maximum). It was used by [\citet=Belloni:2005vl] who averaged a variable number of PDS (with integration time ranging from 64 seconds to 1280 seconds) to obtain a significant detection of the lower QPO. They found that the distribution of lower QPO frequencies showed a pronounced peak around 850 Hz in 4U1636-536. Other less prominent peaks were present in the distribution of frequencies, all centered on different ratios. Later on, [\citet=Belloni:2007ad] monitored 4U1636-536 for 1.5 years, during regular 2 kilosecond pointings separated by 2 days, and found that the distribution of lower QPO frequencies differed from the previous one. In particular, the frequency distribution of the lower QPO extended down to 600 Hz and the overall distribution was flatter than previously measured. They also noticed that when considering one frequency per segment of 2 kseconds, the upper kHz QPO was detected only between 520 Hz and 950 Hz with an even distribution. All this led [\citet=Belloni:2007ad] to conclude that the kHz QPOs in 4U1636-536 did not show intrinsically preferred frequencies.

In this paper, we measure the frequency dependence of nσ and show how it affects the distribution of frequencies measured with the two methods discussed above. This paper extends on previous work by [\citet=Torok:2008lr] who did not directly compute nσ but rather scaled its value as the product of [formula]: the frequency dependence of rS and Δν was recovered for 4U1636-536 by interpolating the values reported by [\citet=2005MNRAS.361..855B], i.e. derived from the analysis of a subset of the data considered here. Here, we have chosen three systems 4U1636-536, 4U0614+091 and Sco X-1, as being representative of low and high luminosity neutron star QPO sources, both in terms of RMS amplitudes and quality factors. Both sources have been extensively observed by RXTE; several hundreds of ObsIDs spanning over more than 10 years, thus minimizing any biases in the frequency distribution of their QPOs that could arise as a result of a non uniform sampling of the source states. This matters because [\citet=Belloni:2005vl] have shown that a time limited and sparse sampling of a source, whose QPO frequency was modeled by a random walk could produce peaked frequency distributions. In addition, as discussed by [\citet=Belloni:2007ad], in the case of 4U1636-536, the long term evolution of the source intensity may also affect the observed frequency distributions.

In the following section, we present the histogram of frequency ratios, as derived from the homogenous processing of all archival data available to date for both 4U1636-536 and 4U0614+091. We then describe the analysis scheme used to recover nσ over the full frequency span of both the lower and upper QPOs. Then, knowing nσ as a function of frequency, assuming an uniform distribution of frequencies for the upper QPO, we show that we can reproduce, without any further assumptions, the clustering of frequency ratios seen in the data. We also illustrate how the method of optimizing the PDS integration time introduce strong biases in the histogram of ratios. Finally, we then extend our analysis to Sco X-1 before concluding.

Data analysis

We have first considered all archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer for 4U1636-536 and 4U0614+091. Our analysis builds upon previous work by [\citet=2005MNRAS.361..855B] [\citet=2005AN....326..808B] [\citet=2006MNRAS.370.1140B] [\citet=2007MNRAS.376.1139B] for 4U1636-536 and by [\citet=2009arXiv0907.3223B] for 4U0614+091. Data are considered per ObsID. For each ObsID, we have computed 16 second PDS with a 1 Hz resolution, using events recorded between 2 and 40 keV. The PDS are normalized according to [\citet=Leahy:1983mb], so that the Poisson noise level is constant around 2. As previously shown for 4U1636-536, the lower QPO can be so strong and so narrow that in some ObsIDs, the frequency drift within the ObsID can be corrected for using a tracking procedure similar to the one described in [\citet=2005MNRAS.361..855B]. Whenever possible, all the 16 second PDS are then aligned to the mean frequency of the lower QPO within the ObsID, to produce one single ObsID averaged PDS (otherwise they are averaged directly). This enables us to obtain meaningful parameters (width and amplitude) averaged over the ObsID, helping us to detect the upper QPO in some case, and in all cases, to identify wether it is a lower or an upper kHz QPO (see below). In 4U0614+091, the QPO is not strong enough to enable such a analysis. The ObsID averaged PDS is then blindly searched for excess power between 300 Hz and 1400 Hz using a scanning technique, as presented in [\citet=Boirin:2000jt]. Each excess (at most the 2 strongest) is then fitted with a Lorentzian with three free parameters; frequency, full width at half maximum (constrained to range from 2 to 1000 Hz), and amplitude (equal to the integrated power of the Lorentzian). The Poisson noise level is fitted separately above 1400 Hz and then frozen when fitting the QPOs (the fitted noise level is generally close to 2, indicating no significant deadtime). Errors on each parameter are computed with Δχ2 = 1. As in previous papers in this field, our threshold for QPOs is related to the ratio (hereafter R) of the Lorentzian amplitude to its 1σ error (R was often quoted and used as a significance). In this paper, our threshold for R is 3, meaning that we consider only QPOs for which we can measure the power of the Lorentzian with an accuracy of 3σ or more. Such a threshold corresponds to a ~  5.5 - 6σ excess power in the PDS for a single trial, equivalent to ~  4σ significance if we account for the number of trials of the scanning procedure [\citep=van-der-Klis:1989kn].

Histograms of ratios

At the end of this first stage of our analysis, we have a set of ObsID averaged PDS (i.e. of comparable durations) with one or two significant QPOs in. For those averaged PDS in which only one significant QPO is detected, we identify whether it is a lower or an upper by placing the QPO parameters in a RMS-ν and quality factor-ν diagram following [\citet=2006MNRAS.370.1140B]. In addition to the histogram of ratios derived from simultaneous twin QPO frequencies, using the nearly linear relationship between the lower and upper QPO frequencies, it is possible to compute the histograms of ratios estimated from the frequencies of all single lower QPOs and all single upper QPOs. The histograms are presented in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig1]; the frequencies entering the histograms are the mean frequencies over the ObsID. The clusters previously found by [\citet=Torok:2008zp] around 1.5 and 1.25 for 4U1636-536 are reproduced and clearly the histograms computed from either the single lower or single upper QPOs is different from the one computed from simultaneous twin QPOs. A cluster of simultaneous twin QPOs centered around 1.5 is also seen from 4U0614+091.

Frequency dependence of QPO significance

We now wish to estimate how the significance of kHz QPOs varies with frequency. For this purpose, we apply the shift-and-add technique [\citep=Mendez:1998qf]. As originally discussed, this technique enables us to combine large amount of data, so that both the lower and upper QPOs can be detected simultaneously (this is possible for some ObsID, but generally requires longer integration times of the PDS). We shift-and-add all ObsID averaged PDS, considering all those with a QPO of the same type falling in the same frequency interval. The width of the frequency interval has been chosen to group enough PDS as to detect the two QPOs simultaneously, with a high significance. The large amount of data in the RXTE archive makes possible to consider interval of 30 Hz for 4U1636-536 and 50 Hz for 4U0614+091. Obviously, not all frequency intervals correspond to the same total PDS integration time, so we normalized the significance using equation [\ref=eq1] to the square root of the observing time of a typical ObsID, which we assumed to be 3 kseconds (this is about the mean duration of all ObsIDs from 4U0614+091: it is closer to 2.5 kseconds for 4U1636-536).

The result of such analysis is shown on Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig2] for both 4U1636-536 and 4U0614+091, which shows the frequency dependence of the QPO significance (excess power in the PDS, single trial) normalized to the same integration time. Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig2] demonstrates that neither the lower or upper QPO are detected over their full frequency span, for a commonly used single trial significance threshold of 5.5σ. As discussed earlier, nσ depends on S, rS and Δν, how those quantity vary with frequency for the lower kHz QPO in 4U1636-536 is shown in Fig. [\ref=boutelier:fig3]. The maximum of nσ corresponds to the maximum of rS and the minimum of Δν (or the maximum of the QPO coherence). From the lowest QPO frequency to the highest one, the mean count rate increases by less than a factor of 2.

For the upper QPO, as shown in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig3], nσ is rather flat: the decrease of rS is compensated by a decrease of Δν and an increase of S. There is a local minimum around 1100 Hz in both sources. For 4U0614+091, [\citet=2009arXiv0907.3223B] have shown that this was related to a local decrease of rS. For 4U1636-536 (and also for 4U1820-303, [\citet=2008NewAR..51..835B]), it is associated with a local increase of the width of the upper QPO (see Fig. [\ref=boutelier:fig3]). This local minimum provides an explanation for the gap in the distribution of frequencies of the upper QPO visible in 4U1636-536 [\citep=2006MNRAS.370.1140B] and in 4U0614+091 [\citep=2009arXiv0907.3223B] (when data are analyzed per ObsID). After the local minimum, nσ reaches a local maximum, enabling us to detect twin QPOs over a narrow range of frequencies, which in turn produces a second cluster of ratios, e.g. below 1.3 in 4U1636-536.

Simulations

Now we wish to visualize the influence of the frequency dependence of the significance of the QPO on the observed distribution of ratios. For this, we assume an uniform distribution of frequencies for the upper QPO which spans a wider range of frequencies than the lower QPO. For example, for 4U1636-536, the upper QPO frequency spans from 550 Hz to 1250 Hz, while the lower QPO frequency varies only from 550 Hz to 950 Hz. Obviously, by drawing a uniform distribution of frequencies within the range of the lower QPO frequency, one would miss all the single upper QPO frequencies below ~  800 Hz (those QPOs populate the right part of the histograms of ratios predicted from the upper QPO also, middle panel in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig1]). For each upper QPO frequency so generated, we compute the frequency of the lower QPO, from a linear function νupper = a  ×  νlower + b with a = 0.70 and b = 520 for 4U1636-536 and a = 1.0, and b = 320 for 4U0614+091 respectively. The a and b parameters were derived for each source by fitting twin QPO frequencies detected simultaneously over the same ObsID. We have checked that the parameters are consistent with each other when fitting the twin QPO frequencies recovered from the shift-and-add procedure described above. Instead of fitting with a linear function, we have also considered a power law function, leading to very similar results, as expected since the two functions are essentially identical in the range where the two QPOs can be detected simultaneously. We discard those predicted lower QPO frequencies falling outside the range of detected frequencies, i.e. below 500 Hz and above 950 Hz. We interpolate between the values of nσ shown in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig2] to estimate the corresponding significance for all generated lower and upper QPO frequencies.

Histograms with a constant integration time

We first consider the case in which the significance of each QPO is computed for a similar integration time (3 kseconds), i.e. reproducing the case where the real data are analyzed ObsID per ObsID (the frequency generated represents the mean QPO frequency within an ObsID). The results of this simulation, considering a significance threshold of 5.5σ, are shown in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig4] in a form similar to Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig2]. What is striking from this figure is that, even this oversimplified simulation, reproduces the shape of the histograms and the clustering of ratios seen in the data. For example, the second cluster of ratios of twin QPOs in 4U1636-536 below 1.3 corresponds to the local maximum of the nσ curve for the upper QPO around 1150 Hz. Finally, it is obvious that the distributions of ratios computed from one of the two QPO frequencies are also not complete and not representative of the underlying distribution. The good agreement between the simulations and the data clearly indicates that the observations performed by RXTE over the ~  10 year period have provided a close to uniform sampling of the kHz QPOs over their entire frequency span.

Histograms with a variable integration time

We have simulated again a uniform distribution of lower QPO frequencies, generating 590 random frequencies corresponding to 590 ObsIDs of 3 kseconds (as is the case for 4U1636-536). Using Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig2] and equation 1, it is possible to compute the minimum PDS integration time, required for the QPO to exceed a significance threshold of 5.5σ, hence the number of detections associated with each segment of 3 kseconds (e.g. for 4U1636-536, at 850 Hz, the significance reaches ~  40σ for 3 kseconds: this corresponds to 5.5σ in about 60 seconds, hence a segment of 3 kseconds will contribute 50 frequencies around 850 Hz in the histogram). Having the lower QPO frequencies, the upper QPO frequencies are estimated with the linear function described above. From this, one can produce an histogram with all the detections, keeping in mind that not all detections correspond to the same PDS integration time. An example of such simulation is shown in Fig [\ref=boutelier:fig5]. The histogram of ratios is strongly peaked around 1.3, as found in data analyzed by the same method by [\citet=Belloni:2005vl]: the main peak was found at 1.30±  0.02 for ν = 856  ±  2. Such histogram (which just reflects the variation of nσ with frequency) is much more biased than the histogram of single lower QPO computed from detections over similar integration times (see Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig4], left hand side, second panel from the top).

More realistic simulations

We have also added complexity to our simulations by modeling the parallel-track phenomenon (or the frequency dependence with count rates), the spread of the ObsID exposure times around their mean value and a varying number of active PCA units (the latter two quantities being obviously not frequency dependent). We have also included a jitter in frequency along the linear correlation between the two frequencies. In all cases, this does not change significantly the histograms simulated, it just increases slightly the spread of the clusters, making them more similar with the data. This is illustrated for the case of 4U0614+091 in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig6]. The gap between 1.4 and 1.5 in the ratio distribution is now filled in.

Sco X-1

Building on the above findings, it is worth looking back at the historical case of Sco X-1, and see whether the same effect can provide an explanation for the clustering of ratio claimed at 1.5 [\citep=Abramowicz:2003sf]. For this purpose, we have reprocessed all the available data from the RXTE archive, extending on the data used by [\citet=van-der-Klis:1997hb] [\citet=2000MNRAS.318..938M]. We have used all science event and binned mode data with a time resolution better than 250 μs. We have again computed 16 second PDS with a 1 Hz resolution, using events recorded between 2 and 40 keV. The analysis here is complicated by deadtime effect, which we have to account for in the PDS analysis. We have modeled the modification of the PDS with a power law of index close to zero at high frequencies, and fitted the QPOs with the method described above. Over our data set, we have detected about 100 QPOs from the source on a typical ObsID timescales. Likewise for the two other sources, we identify single QPOs by placing them on a RMS/quality factor versus frequency plot. The lower QPO frequency varies from 550 Hz to 800 Hz, while the upper QPO frequency varies between 750 Hz and 1100 Hz. Previous analysis [\citep=van-der-Klis:1997hb] [\citep=2000MNRAS.318..938M], based on a smaller data set, found the upper QPO frequency to range from about 850 Hz to 1150 Hz. We report for the first time, an upper QPO at a frequency of 750 Hz, detected in the ObsID 93067-01-01-02 recorded on July 3rd, 2007 at 10:33 am. Next to the 750 Hz upper QPO, the second lowest upper QPO frequency is at   ~  850 Hz, implying a gap of 100 Hz in its frequency distribution. The histograms of ratios are shown in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig7]. As previously found the histograms cluster around 1.5. We have then applied the shift-and-add technique to the ObsID averaged PDS as described above, and computed the average statistical significance of both QPOs, which we then normalized to a PDS integration time of 3 kseconds. The results are also shown on Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig7]. In Sco X-1, the lower QPO is detected on such a timescale only in a narrow 300 Hz interval, whereas the upper QPO is always more significant and detected over a slightly wider frequency span ~  350 Hz wide (note however that there is only one ObsID in the first histogram bin where the significance reaches a maximum). Note that the narrowness of the frequency range for the both QPOs limits by itself the range of possible ratios between 1.3 and 1.6. Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig8] shows how S, rS and Δν depend on frequency for both the lower and upper kHz QPOs. As can be seen, the 750 Hz QPO follows the same trends rS and Δν as upper QPOs detected above 800 Hz, and is therefore very likely a single upper QPO. Note also that the mean count rate varies by less than 20% of the mean, across the frequency range over which both QPOs are detected.

As for the two other sources, in an attempt to compare with the observations, we have simulated a uniform distribution of upper QPO frequencies between 850 Hz and 1100 Hz where the bulk of the upper QPOs are detected [\citep=van-der-Klis:1997hb]. We have computed the histogram of ratios using a linear function with a = 0.81 and b = 416, which is equivalent to a power law relation νlower = A(νupper / 1000 ~ Hz)B, with A= 717 and B= 1.78 in the range of frequency considered. We have also included a spread in the count rate, exposure time, number of PCUs and a jitter in frequency along the correlation line. The results are shown in Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig9]. Clearly, the simulations reproduces nicely the observed distributions, in particular the strong clustering of ratio around 1.5. We thus conclude that as in the two other sources, the apparent clustering of frequency ratios in Sco X-1 is also consistent with a uniform distribution of frequencies between 850 Hz and 1100 Hz. However, in Sco X-1 the clustering seems to be amplified compared to the other sources, by the fact that both QPOs can be detected simultaneously over an narrower frequency range.

Conclusions

We have shown that, because of the way the significance of kHz QPOs evolves with frequency, as a result of the QPO RMS amplitude and width being frequency dependent quantities, in sensitivity limited observations the observed clusters in frequency ratios of simultaneous twin QPO frequencies, in particular around 1.5, are consistent with an underlying uniform frequency distribution. In other words, this implies that the clustering of ratios does not provide any evidence for preferred frequency ratios in those systems. A similar conclusion was reached by [\citet=Belloni:2007ad] who found that the distribution of frequencies could be significantly different from one data set to the other. The clustering is a consequence of the fact, that albeit always present, the lower and upper QPOs can only be detected together on the same integration timescales over a limited frequency range. The clustering of ratios is more pronounced in Sco X-1 because the range of simultaneous detection of the two QPOs is narrower (~  250 - 300 Hz instead of 400 Hz). This conclusion applies to a sample of systems representative of all types of QPO sources. As said above, clustering of ratios caused by an incomplete sampling of the source states, whether or not its QPO frequency follows a random walk [\citep=Belloni:2005vl] is more and more unlikely, as more and more data become available.

Any models, attempting to reproduce the clusters of ratios, must therefore predict first a nearly linear relationship between the two QPO frequencies in the range where the bulk of QPOs are detected, as most models do, including non-linear resonance based models [\citep=2003PASJ...55..467A], and second, a set of well matched QPO parameters (RMS amplitude and width) which allows the two QPOs to be preferentially detected on similar timescales over limited frequency ranges. [\citet=Torok:2009ay] already pointed out that at frequencies corresponding to the 3/2 ratio, the RMS amplitudes of the lower and upper QPOs as measured in the 2-40 keV band are equal (this is where the significance of the two QPOs are comparable, around 600 Hz, 900 Hz for the lower and upper respectively, see Figure [\ref=boutelier:fig2]). In the framework of the non-linear resonance model proposed by [\cite=2003PASJ...55..467A], this has recently been discussed as a possible signature of a resonant energy exchange between the two QPO modes [\citep=Horak:2009la]. Although such a possibility should be investigated further, it is worth stressing that non linear resonance was invoked for neutron star QPOs by interpreting the 3/2 clustering of frequency ratios as reflecting a non uniform distribution of frequencies along the line of correlation predicted by the model [\citep=2003PASJ...55..467A]. This is the reason why the results presented in this paper weaken the case for a resonance mechanism at the origin of neutron star kHz QPOs, as they indicate that even a uniform distribution of frequencies will produce peaks in the ratio distribution around 3/2.
