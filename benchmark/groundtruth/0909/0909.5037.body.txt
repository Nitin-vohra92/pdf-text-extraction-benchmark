Note on quasi-numerically positive log canonical divisors

Shigetaka FUKUDA

In this note, every algebraic variety is defined over the field [formula] of complex numbers. We follow the terminology and notation in [\cite=Ko].

Introduction

The quasi-nup divisors are the divisors "of maximal nef dimension" in the terminology of the "Eight Authors" [\cite=BCEKPRSW].

Ambro [\cite=Am] and Birkar-Cascini-Hacon-McKernan [\cite=BCHM] reduced the famous log abundance conjecture to the termination conjecture for log flips and the semiampleness conjecture (Conjecture [\ref=Conj]) for quasi-nup log canonical divisors KX  +  Δ, in the category of Kawamata log terminal (klt, for short) pairs. In Section [\ref=Sect:P] we propose a subconjecture (Subconjecture [\ref=Subconj]) that implies the semiampleness Conjecture [\ref=Conj].

We state the history in detail. In the category of klt pairs (X,Δ), Fukuda [\cite=Fu02] reduced the log abundance to the existence and termination of log flips, the existence of log canonical bundle formula and the semiampleness of quasi-nup log canonical divisors, by using the numerically trivial fibrations ([\cite=Tsuji], see also [\cite=BCEKPRSW]) due to Tsuji and the semiampleness criterion ([\cite=Ka85a] and [\cite=Ny86], see also Fujino [\cite=Fuj09]) for log canonical divisors due to Kawamata-Nakayama. Ambro [\cite=Am] gave and proved the celebrated log canonical bundle formula. The existence of log flips is now the theorem [\cite=BCHM] due to Birkar, Cascini, Hacon and McKernan. This history is along the line of Reid's philosophy stated in the famous Pagoda paper [\cite=Re83].

There is another approach to the semiampleness Conjecture [\ref=Conj]. Let (X,Δ) be a klt pair whose log canonical divisor KX  +  Δ is quasi-nup. Hacon and McKernan (Lazic [\cite=La], Theorem A.6) considered to embed (X,Δ) into some log canonical pair [formula] so that [formula] and [formula], that the log canonical divisor [formula] is nef and big, that [formula] and that [formula] is endowed with the birational contraction morphism [formula] that contracts the prime divisor [formula] to some point. In Section [\ref=Sect:E], motivated by this consideration, we prove the semiampleness (Theorem [\ref=Thm:MT]) for log canonical pairs in some elementary cases.

Subconjecture for klt pairs

We give an approach towards the above-mentioned semiampleness conjecture in this section. The approach repeats the process of finding some (KX  +  Δ)-trivial curve that generates a (KX  +  Γ)-extremal ray for some other klt pair (X,Γ) and contracting this extremal ray. The process would terminate at the ample log canonical divisor. To run the process, it is important not to require the [formula]-factoriality of X.

Procedure [\ref=Proced] relates Subconjecture [\ref=Subconj] to Conjecture [\ref=Conj]. The following is the main result of this section:

Let (X,Δ) be a Kawamata log terminal pair such that X is projective and the log canonical divisor KX  +  Δ is quasi-nup. If Subconjecture [\ref=Subconj] is true, then, by repeating Procedure [\ref=Proced], we obtain a Kawamata log terminal pair (X',Δ') with the birational morphism ψ:X  →  X' such that KX  +  Δ  =  ψ*(KX'  +  Δ') and that KX'  +  Δ' is ample, because the Picard numbers decrease 1 by 1.

See Remark [\ref=Hist] and the theorem above.

From the corollary above and the existense theorem [\cite=Ka] for extremal rational curves by Kawamata, we can say that the log abundance conjecture is the existence problem for some kind of rational curves, modulo the termination of log flips.

We show that Subconjecture [\ref=Subconj] is a part of Conjecture [\ref=Conj].

Consider the surjective morphism φ:X  →  Y(  =  Φ|k(KX  +  Δ)|(X)) induced by the linear system |k(KX  +  Δ)| for a sufficiently large and divisible integer k. This morphism φ becomes birational, because of the Stein factorisation theorem and the fact that the pull-backs of ample divisors by finite morphisms are ample. Then k(KX  +  Δ)  =  φ*H for an ample divisor H on Y. By the Kodaira Lemma, if m is sufficiently large and divisible, then mφ*H  =  A  +  E for some ample divisor A and some effective divisor E. For every φ-exceptional curve C, we obtain the inequality that (E,C)  <  0, because (mφ*H,C) = 0 and (A,C) > 0. Here the class

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=Lemm] gives the assertion.

Log canonical pairs in some elementary cases

We prove the semiampleness for log canonical pairs in some elementary cases.

Every KX  +  f*H-extremal ray is a KX  +  (1  -  η)f*H-extremal ray for some small number η  >  0. The length of the former extremal ray is less than or equal to that of the latter. Thus the result [\cite=Ka] of Kawamata for klt pairs gives the boudedness of the length of KX  +  f*H-extremal rays. By using the argument in [\cite=KeMaMc], we have [formula]C[formula]. Thus KX  +  f*H  +  E  +  ν(KX  +  f*H) is nef.

If Y is [formula]-factorial, then the condition that - E is f-ample in Assumption [\ref=Assum:II] is automatically satisfied, under Assumption [\ref=Assum:I]. (cf. Kollár-Mori [\cite=KoMo], Lemma 2.62)

Assume that KX  +  f*H  +  (1 - ε)E  =  f*(KY  +  H)  +  (1  +  λ  -  ε)E is not big for every small number ε > 0. Thus its self intersection number is zero for every ε from Proposition [\ref=Prop:I]. Therefore ( - E)dim E  -   dim f(E)  ·  (f*(KY  +  H)dim f(E)  ·  E)  =  0. This contradicts to the f-ampleness of - E. Consequently KX  +  f*H  +  (1 - ε)E is big for every small number ε  >  0 and so is KX  +  f*H  +  (1 - ε)E  +  εE.

The divisor f*(KY  +  H)|E  -  εE|E on E is ample for every small number ε > 0 (cf. [\cite=KoMo], Proposition 1.45). We also recall that f*(KY  +  H)  +  (1  +  λ  -  ε)E  =  KX  +  f*H  +  (1 - ε)E is nef by Proposition [\ref=Prop:I]. Thus (KX  +  f*H  +  E)|E  =  (f*(KY  +  H)  +  (1  +  λ)E)|E is ample, from the inequality -  ε  >  1 + λ  >  1 + λ  -  ε.

We state the main result of this section:

For proof, we need the concept of "nef and log big".

The "only if " part is trivial. So we prove the "if" part.

In Case (1), [formula].

In Case (2), [formula].

In Case (3), [formula] and [formula].

In any cases above, ((KX  +  f*H  +  E)|Γ)dim Γ  >  0 for every [formula] by Proposition [\ref=Prop:III]. We also recall that KX  +  f*H  +  E is big by Proposition [\ref=Prop:II]

Consequently the base point free theorem [\cite=Fu] of Reid type implies that KX  +  f*H  +  E is semiample, because it becomes nef and log big on (X,f*H  +  E).
