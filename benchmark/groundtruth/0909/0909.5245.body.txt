Introduction

There has been recent interest in the study of systems of rational difference equations. The purpose of this article is to provide several analogues for successful techniques which were responsible for some well known boundedness results on the kth order rational difference equation. The well known results we refer to are those presented in [\cite=c1]. Several years following the appearance of [\cite=c1] in the literature, [\cite=fpinv] appeared in the literature. [\cite=fpinv] primarily served to generalize some of the results presented in [\cite=c1]. This was done by showing that some analogous results held for certain recursive inequalities. It turns out that this generalization is very useful when studying the boundedness character of systems of rational difference equations. Often times a complicated system will have a simpler difference inequality associated. We then use Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv] to show that one of the sequences {xn}∞n = 1 or {yn}∞n = 1 is bounded. In this way Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv] will provide the primary mechanism used in the proof of many of the results presented below.

Using a Comparison

Since we are presenting many results on systems of two rational difference equations which are analogues to the results of [\cite=c1] and since we make heavy use of [\cite=fpinv], it should come as no surprise that we make use of similar notation. So we let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We also define min +(  ·  ,  ·  ) to be the minimum of non-zero elements. This notation will allow us to shorten some arguments which we present later. In order for min +(  ·  ,  ·  ) to be well defined at least one of the elements must be non-zero. For the results in this section, we assume that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. We use this comparison and Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv] to prove that every solution is bounded for certain systems of rational difference equations.

We begin with two theorems which generalize the standard iteration result to systems of two rational difference equations where there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. Eventually these two theorems are subsumed by several slightly more general theorems at the end of the article, particularly Theorem 20 and Theorem 21. In the following theorem, we use the results from [\cite=fpinv] to iterate with respect to xn.

Suppose that we have a kth order system of two rational difference equations

[formula]

[formula]

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Further assume that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. Also suppose that A > 0 and there exists a positive integer η, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with [formula] for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Since M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn we have

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {xn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Moreover using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N. The fact that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn immediately yields the full result.

Now, in the following theorem, we use the results from [\cite=fpinv] to iterate with respect to yn.

Also suppose that q > 0 and there exists a positive integer η, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with [formula] for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Since M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn we have

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {yn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have yn  ≤  M for all n > N. The fact that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn yields the full result.

[formula]

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Further assume that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. Also suppose that A = 0 and one of the following holds

[formula] and [formula]

q = 0, [formula], and [formula]

p,q > 0, [formula], and [formula]

and there exists a positive integer η, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with [formula] for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {xn} is bounded below by a constant. Now suppose that q = 0, [formula], and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {yn} is bounded below by a constant. Now suppose that p,q > 0, [formula], and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {yn} is bounded below by a constant. Now we have shown that there exists A2 > 0, so that {xn} is bounded below by A2 and [formula] or {yn} is bounded below by A2 and [formula]. We use this fact to show the following.

[formula]

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {xn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Moreover using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N. The fact that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn immediately yields the full result.

Now, in the following theorem, we use the results from [\cite=fpinv] to iterate with respect to yn.

Suppose that we have a kth order system of two rational difference equations

[formula]

[formula]

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Further assume that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. Also suppose that q = 0 and one of the following holds

A = 0, [formula], and [formula]

α,A > 0, [formula], and [formula]

[formula] and [formula]

and there exists a positive integer η, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with [formula] for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Suppose that A = 0, [formula], and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {xn} is bounded below by a constant. Now suppose that A,α > 0, [formula], and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {xn} is bounded below by a constant. Now suppose that [formula], and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {yn} is bounded below by a constant. Now we have shown that there exists q2 > 0, so that {xn} is bounded below by q2 and [formula] or {yn} is bounded below by q2 and [formula]. We use this fact to show the following.

[formula]

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {yn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Again using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have yn  ≤  M for all n > N. The fact that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn yields the full result.

For the following two theorems, no iteration is necessary. We only need to use some algebraic techniques similar to those used in [\cite=c1], coupled with the condition that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula].

Some boundedness Results Without Comparison

In this section we use some algebraic techniques similar to those applied in [\cite=c1]. Once we have obtained a difference inequality we apply Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv].

Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N.

We know that {yn}∞n = 1 is bounded above and below let us call those bounds m1  ≤  yn  ≤  m2. This means that we have

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {xn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Moreover using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N.

p,q > 0, ID  ⊂  Iδ, IE  ⊂  Iε, and [formula]

Iγ  ⊂  IC, and there exists a positive integer η, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with cm∈Iβ for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Suppose IB  ⊂  Iβ, IC  ⊂  Iγ, and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {yn} is bounded below by a constant. Now we have shown that there exists A2 > 0, so that {xn} is bounded below by A2 and [formula] or {yn} is bounded below by A2 and [formula]. We use this fact to show the following.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {xn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Moreover using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Further assume that there exists a positive integer η2, such that for every sequence {dm}∞m = 1 with dm∈Iε for [formula] there exists positive integers, N3,N4  ≤  η2 [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

By Theorem 7 we get immediately that there exists M1  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M1 for all n > N. We now use this fact as follows

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {yn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Moreover using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M2  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have yn  ≤  M2 for all n > N.

Some Boundedness Results Involving a One Sided Comparison

For the results in this section, we either assume that there exists M1 > 0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn for all [formula], or we assume that there exists M1 > 0 and M2  ≥  0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn  +  M2 for all [formula]. We use these one sided comparisons and Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv] to prove that every solution is bounded for certain systems of rational difference equations.

For the first two results we assume that yn  ≤  M1xn for some M1 > 0. No iteration is used in the next result.

Suppose that we have a kth order system of two rational difference equations

[formula]

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Assume that there exists M1 > 0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn for all [formula]. Further assume that A = 0, α = 0, [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Since we have assumed yn  ≤  M1xn it suffices to find a bound for {xn}∞n = 1. Notice that

[formula]

[formula]

So xn  ≤  M for all n > N. Since we have assumed that there exists M1 > 0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn for all [formula], we obtain the full result.

In the following result we use Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] to iterate, first with respect to yn and then with respect to xn.

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Assume that there exists M1 > 0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn for all [formula]. Further assume that A = 0,q > 0, one of the following holds

IB  ⊂  Iβ, IC  ⊂  Iγ and [formula]

p > 0, ID  ⊂  Iδ, IE  ⊂  Iε and [formula]

Iδ  ⊂  ID, there exists a positive integer η1, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with cm∈Iε for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η1 [formula], such that [formula], and there exists a positive integer η2, such that for every sequence {dm}∞m = 1 with dm∈Iβ for [formula] there exists positive integers, N3,N4  ≤  η2 [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

First we must prove that {yn}∞n = 1 is bounded above. Since q > 0 and Iδ  ⊂  ID we have,

[formula]

[formula]

Thus the sequence {yn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M2  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have yn  ≤  M2 for all n > N. Let us show that {xn} or {yn} is bounded below by a constant A2. Suppose IB  ⊂  Iβ, IC  ⊂  Iγ, and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {xn} is bounded below by a constant. Now suppose p > 0, ID  ⊂  Iδ, IE  ⊂  Iε, and [formula] then we have

[formula]

[formula]

So in this case {yn} is bounded below by a constant. Now we have shown that there exists A2 > 0, so that {xn} is bounded below by A2 and [formula] or {yn} is bounded below by A2 and [formula]. We use this fact to show the following.

[formula]

Thus we see that the sequence {xn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M3  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn  ≤  M3 for all n > N.

For the next five results we assume that there exists M1 > 0 and M2  ≥  0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn  +  M2 for all [formula]. In the next result we use Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv] to iterate with respect to yn and then apply Theorem 11.

[formula]

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Assume that there exists M1 > 0 and M2  ≥  0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn  +  M2 for all [formula]. Further assume that A,q > 0 Iδ  ⊂  ID, there exists a positive integer η1, such that for every sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with cm∈Iε for [formula] there exists positive integers, N1,N2  ≤  η1 [formula], such that [formula], and there exists a positive integer η2, such that for every sequence {dm}∞m = 1 with dm∈Iβ for [formula] there exists positive integers, N3,N4  ≤  η2 [formula], such that [formula]. Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

It suffices to prove that {yn}∞n = 1 is bounded above then we simply apply Theorem 11 to obtain the result. Since q > 0 and Iδ  ⊂  ID we have,

[formula]

Where [formula]. Thus the sequence {yn}∞n = 1 satisfies the above difference inequality. Using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have yn  ≤  M for all n > N. Thus applying Theorem 11 we obtain the result.

For the following result we use Theorem 1 of [\cite=fpinv] to iterate with respect to xn and then we use the inequality yn  ≤  M1xn  +  M2 for M1 > 0 and M2  ≥  0.

Then there exists M  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have xn,yn  ≤  M for all n > N.

Since we have assumed yn  ≤  M1xn + M2 it suffices to find a bound for {xn}∞n = 1. Notice that

Using Theorem 1 in [\cite=fpinv] we see that there exists M3  >  0 and [formula] so that given any non-negative initial conditions, we have yn  ≤  M3 for all n > N. Let us show that {xn} or {yn} is bounded below by a constant A2. Suppose IB  ⊂  Iβ, IC  ⊂  Iγ, and [formula] then we have

Conditions of Comparability

Since the comparisons presented above provide us with such useful tools to study boundedness we devote this section to determining whether a system of two equations satisfies any of the necessary inequalities.

Suppose that we have a kth order system of two rational difference equations

[formula]

[formula]

with non-negative parameters and non-negative initial conditions. Further suppose that Iδ  ⊂  Iβ, IB  ⊂  ID, Iε  ⊂  Iγ, IC  ⊂  IE. Also assume that whenever A > 0, then q > 0, and whenever p  >  0, then α > 0. Then there exists M1 > 0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn for all [formula].

First notice that it suffices to show that eventually for n  ≥  N there exists M > 0 so that yn  ≤  Mxn. This is since we may take [formula] , where [formula] and n < N}. Notice that since Iδ  ⊂  Iβ, Iε  ⊂  Iγ, and whenever p > 0, then α > 0 we get that whenever xn = 0, then yn = 0. Thus yn  ≤  M1xn for all [formula] with xn = 0.

First notice that Theorem 24 applies to this system. This gives us M3 > 0 so that yn  ≤  M3xn for all [formula]. Moreover after a very simple change of variables Theorem 24 applies again. The change of variables we refer to here comes from renaming xn as yn, βi as εi, Bi as Ei, γi as δi, Ci as Di, α as p, A as q, and vice versa. This gives us M2 > 0 so that xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. Choose [formula] and we get that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula].

First notice that it suffices to show that eventually for n  ≥  N there exists M3 > 0 and M4  ≥  0 so that yn  ≤  M3xn  +  M4. This is since we may take M1 = M3 and M2  =   max (M4, max n < Nyn) and so there exists M1 > 0 and M2  ≥  0 so that yn  ≤  M1xn  +  M2 for all [formula]. In the case where A > 0 and p > 0 we have

Then there exists M1,M3 > 0 and M4  ≥  M2  ≥  0 so that xn  ≤  M1yn + M2  ≤  M3xn + M4 for all [formula].

First notice that Theorem 26 applies to this system. This gives us M5 > 0 and M6  ≥  0 so that yn  ≤  M5xn  +  M6 for all [formula]. Moreover after a very simple change of variables Theorem 26 applies again. The change of variables we refer to here comes from renaming xn as yn, βi as εi, Bi as Ei, γi as δi, Ci as Di, α as p, A as q, and vice versa.

Some Examples

Here we present some examples which demonstrate how the results presented earlier in this article are applied to particular special cases.

We apply Theorem 1. First notice that, by theorem 25, that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. This is since

We apply by Theorem 10 case (iii). The conditions specific for case (iii) are satisfied since

[formula]

For the final condition, let η = 2 so that for any sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with cm∈Iβ  =  {1}, for [formula], we choose N1 = 1,N2 = 2  ≤  η [formula], such that [formula].

We apply Theorem 6. We will now prove that there exists constants M1,M2  >  0 so that M1yn  ≤  xn  ≤  M2yn for all [formula]. To show this, we first show that there exists L so that yn  ≥  L or all [formula]. We now show that we may choose [formula]. To show this, we first deduce the following inequality

[formula]

Thus xn  ≤  M1yn + M2 + 1  ≤  M3xn + M4  +  2 for all [formula].

Case (i) is satisfied, since [formula], α > 0, and [formula]. For the final condition, let η = 1 so that for any sequence {cm}∞m = 1 with [formula] for [formula] we choose N1 = 1, N2 = 1  ≤  η so that [formula]

We apply Theorem 14 case (ii). To apply Theorem 14 we must use a change of variables. The change of variables we refer to here comes from renaming xn as yn, βi as εi, Bi as Ei, γi as δi, Ci as Di, α as p, A as q, and vice versa. Although we use this change of variables, we keep notation consistent with our notation before the change of variables for the remainder of this example. We do this to avoid confusion. First notice that, by applying Theorem 24 after the change of variables, we see that there exists M1 > 0 so that xn  ≤  M1yn for all [formula]. This is since

We apply Theorem 22 case (ii). We will now prove that there exists M1,M3 > 0 and M4  >  M2  >  0 so that xn  ≤  M1yn + M2  ≤  M3xn + M4 for all [formula]. We now show that we may choose [formula] and [formula]. This is since

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula]. To deduce M1 and M2 we show that there exists L so that yn  ≥  L for all [formula]. So,

[formula]

Hence, [formula]. Now we show that we may choose [formula] and M2 = 1. So,

Conclusion

We have presented numerous techniques which apply the method of iteration to systems of rational difference equations. These techniques provide a starting point for the immense task of understanding the boundedness character of systems of rational difference equations of order greater than one. There are three directions for further work which we feel have promise. One important goal is to provide some type of comprehensive criterion which, when satisfied, guarantees the success of the boundedness by iteration technique. Theorem 6 in [\cite=c1] provided this type of criterion for rational difference equations of order greater than one. We feel that a similar approach is required for systems of rational difference equations of order greater than one. Another important direction for further work is to apply similar techniques to those presented above for systems of three or more rational difference equations. Analogues to the ideas in [\cite=knopfhuang] for systems of rational difference equations would be another direction of interest. See [\cite=syspln], [\cite=ladassystems1], and [\cite=lugopal] for further work on systems of rational difference equations.
