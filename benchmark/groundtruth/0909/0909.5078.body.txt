Axionic Shortcuts for High Energy Photons

[formula]

where Vδ is the volume of the extra space. For a torus configuration

with Ri ([formula]) the radii of extra dimensions. Then for a sufficiently large volume Vδ the fundamental scale of gravity Mf can become as low as MW. In this radical way the hierarchy problem ceases to exist as such.

The prospect of gravity becoming strong at TeV energies, opens the possibility of studying gravity in particle collisions at accessible energies (at present or in the near future). To that respect, salient features of the cosmic ray spectrum (the "knee") have been attributed to gravitational bremsstrablung [\cite=2]. By reproducing the cosmic ray sprectum, the parameters of the low scale gravity can be inferred (δ  ~  4 and Mf  ~  8TeV). Within the same scenario, we may anticipate the formation of black holes in high energy collisions, signaled by an enhancement of backward scattering, associated with rainbow-like diffraction patterns [\cite=3]. Besides the graviton, fields which are standard-model singlets, like a sterile neutrino [\cite=4] [\cite=5] [\cite=6] or an axion [\cite=7] [\cite=8] can freely propagate in the bulk. These particles accrue then an infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations and the issue of mass eigenstates and mixing has to be revisited.

In the next part we consider the photon-axion mixing, induced by a magnetic field, in the context of large extra dimensions. Compared to the usual oscillations, novel features appear linked to the presence of the new scale, the radius of the extra dimension (or its inverse, the mass of the Kaluza-Klein excitation). We study in detail the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the mixing matrix and establish the resonance condition for the total conversion of a high energy photon into a KK axion state. In the third part we examine the astrophysical implications of our formalism, notably the production and propagation of photons in sites of strong magnetic fields (neutron stars, GRBs). A photon-generated KK axion can take a "shortcut" through the bulk and appear earlier, compared to a photon traveling along a geodesic on the brane. We quantify this effect and analyze its relevance for the timing of photons observed by the MAGIC telescope during an activity of Markarian 501. The axionic shortcuts broaden also the photon light cone, providing correlations on superhorizon scales and enhancing the uniform appearance of the universe. At the end we present our conclusions.

[formula]

where Fμν is the electromagnetic field tensor, μν is its dual, a is the axion field. The mass mPQ of the standard axion, as well as the axion-photon coupling are inversely proportional to the scale fPQ. For a recent account of the axion searches see ref 12.

To simplify the calculation for the higher-dimensional case, we consider one extra compact dimension y and a singlet axion field a(xμ,y). Projected into the brane the axion field will appear as a collection of KK modes an(xμ), each having a mass [formula], where R is the compactification radius. The coupling of the KK axions to the photon is universal [\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=13] [\cite=14]

The mixing matrix M between the photon state A|| parallel to the magnetic field B, the standard PQ axion a0 and the KK axions an is [\cite=8]

The plasma frequency is ω2pl  =  (4πane) / me for an electron density ne.

In the limit R  →  0, the KK modes become unaccessible and eqn.([\ref=7]) is reduced to

[formula]

describing the ordinary two-level mixing. For a relatively small radius, we may use the Taylor expansion [formula] and we obtain an equation similar to eqn.([\ref=9]), with Δγ replaced by an effective Δeff, given by

[formula]

In the absence of a magnetic field the unperturbed eigenvalues are the diagonal elements Δγ, Δ0, Δ1, [formula] ,ΔN. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the eigenvalues λn are approximately given by

[formula]

The eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue λn is defined by the row vector [formula]. The elements of the eigenvector satisfy the equation

[formula]

The amplitude for a photon converted into the nth KK axion and then back to photon is given by |Enγ|2. This amplitude is maximized whenever the resonance condition

[formula]

is satisfied. For n  =  1 the resonance is a narrow one and the amplitude A(γ  →  γ) is enhanced. For large n, the resonance is a broad one, many KK states interfere destructively and the amplitude A(γ  →  γ) is reduced.

Within this scheme, photons of high energy produced in an active nucleus are transformed through an MSW type resonance into KK axions, which travel unimpeded before being reconverted back into photons. For photons not satisfying the resonance condition, the probability to transit as KK axions is reduced and therefore these photons are limited by the opacity of two photon annihilation into an electro-positron pair. Our approach offers a plausible explanation for the transparency of the universe to energetic photons [\cite=15]. Photons of the appropriate energy, are transformed into KK axions, travel freely in the bulk space, before returning back into the brane and observed again as photons. The same mechanism may provide also high energy photons escaping the GZK cutoff [\cite=16].

The advent of imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescope like HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS, FERMI, CTA, allows the detection of photons from astrophysical sources (neutron stars, GRB, AGN) in the high energy window from 100GeV to few TeV. The MAGIC telescope analyzed the timing of photons originating from the Mkn 501 source [\cite=17]. It was found that the photons in the 0.25  -  0.6TeV energy range precede by 4 minutes the photons in the 1.2  -  10TeV energy band. The observed features might be possible to be explained within an astrophysical context [\cite=18]. A particle physics solution, within the framework of quantum gravity [\cite=19] [\cite=20] has been suggested also. Quantum fluctuations of space-time lead to a speed of light dependent upon energy, thus creating a dispersion in the time arrival of photons [\cite=21].

The transition of a photon to a KK axion, offers another alternative to analyze the observed dispersion in time arrival of high energy photons. A particle, travelling from a point on the brane to another point on the brane, may take a "shortcut" by following a geodesic in the bulk and arriving earlier compared to a particle which follows a geodesic on the brane [\cite=22]. In our case a photon, transformed into a KK axion traveling through the bulk, may reappear earlier on the brane, compared to a photon stuck in the brane. There are a number of ways shortcuts emerge in theories with extra dimensions. In a brane containing matter and energy, self-gravity will induce a curvature to the brane, so that the brane becomes concave towards the bulk in the null direction. Then we can find geodesics in the bulk propagating signals faster compared to the geodesics in the brane [\cite=22]. A phenomenology, with a sterile neutrino shortcuting through the bulk has been developed [\cite=23] [\cite=24], accounting for all neutrino oscillation data. A 1 + 1 dimensional toy model may exhibit the expected behavior [\cite=23]. In a Minkowski metric

[formula]

the curved brane is represented by

[formula]

while the bulk geodesic is given by x2 = 0. A signal transmitted through the bulk will appear as having a superluminal speed. Equivalently a difference in time arrival will be observed given by

[formula]

where tγ is the time it takes for the photon in the brane and tα is the corresponding time for the photon which uses the axionic shortcut. Within our model, the photons having the resonance energy, eqn.([\ref=15]), use the axionic shortcut and arrive earlier compared to the other photons of different energies which propagate along the brane. >From the MAGIC experimental data we infer that the 0.25 - 0.6TeV photon energy brackets the aforementioned resonance energy. The amount of the time difference is determined by the brane shape-parameter Ak and the rauge of the magnetic field B. The magnetic field near the core of a GRB or a blazar reaches high values. We adopt the average value of B = 107 G. By appealing to the Hillas criterion [\cite=25] we obtain a range for the magnetic field of the order of 109 km. Then the set of values R = 10- 3 cm, fPQ = 1012 GeV, B = 107 G, E = 500 GeV, Δt = 4 min, implies for the shape parameter the value Ak≃1. Monitoring the astrophysical sites, where high energy photons are produced in the presence of strong magnetic fields, might be revealing. We might observe the disappearance of high energy photons, as a result of a photon - KK axion transition. Or, we might notice the sudden appearance of high energy photons, connected to the intrusion of KK axions from the bulk into the brane.

The presence of a KK axion may affect aspects of current cosmology [\cite=26] [\cite=27]. It is beyond the scope of the present work a detailed account of these aspects. It suffices to remark the following. A KK axion living in the bulk and with a mass determined as [formula] may assume the role of the dark matter particle. Within the evolution history of the universe, the brane shape-parameter Ak evolves with time. It is anticipated that in the early Universe the parameter Ak would have a significantly higher value. If rγ is the horizon radius for the causal propagation of photon signals on the brane and ra is the horizon radius for the causal propagation of photon signals mediated by a KK axion through the bulk, then in the early moments of the Universe the ratio rα  /  rγ may attain high values of the order 103 [\cite=28]. The communication of information over length scales rα >  > rγ might lessen the severity of the horizon problem and change the initial conditions for inflation. Photon correlations on superhorizon scales lead also to a redefinition of the last scattering surface to earlier times.
