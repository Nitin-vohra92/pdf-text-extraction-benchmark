Higher dimensional operads

Introduction

Operads (as defined by P.May in [\cite=Ma72]) can be described as formalizations of properties of [formula], for a generic vector space V. Similarly, PROPs are modeled on [formula].

This kind of models is not suitable to describe cyclic operads, which are modeled on {Vn + 1}n  ≥  0, using a bilinear form on V. In turn, this model is not suitable anymore to describe modular operads.

There is one model, that is good for most kinds of operads: real (singular) curves with marked points. Here we consider every curve as an operation, connecting the marked points on it. Having several such curves we can glue them at marked points, or take their disjoint union.

In some contexts we might consider unoriented curves, and hence arrive at cyclic and modular operads, in other contexts we can orient the curves and obtain PROPs, or more generally wheeled PROPs. This approach to operads was developed in [\cite=KM94], [\cite=GK98], [\cite=BeM96], [\cite=BM08].

All these different theories have one thing in common: they are modeled on 1-dimensional objects - curves. This paper deals with the following problem: find the formalization of the algebraic properties of higher dimensional varieties, when we have marked subvarieties of arbitrary codimension, perhaps having non-empty intersections.

These marked subvarieties can have their own marked sub-subvarieties, and so on. Gluing happens on many levels at once, e.g. if a marked point P sits on two marked curves C1, C2 in a variety, gluing this variety with another one along C1 is accompanied by gluing C2 with something at P.

In this paper we solve this problem, and call the resulting concept nested operads.

To define 1-dimensional operads using curves, one uses the dual graphs of curves, i.e. if we have a curve C with marked points [formula], the dual graph has one vertex, corresponding to C, and n flags coming out of it (corresponding to the marked points). If pi = pj, the corresponding flags comprise an edge, and so on.

In effect we have two kinds of nodes in dual graphs: vertices, that correspond to curves, and ends of flags, that correspond to points. In the higher dimensional case we obviously have more than two kinds. If we want to define dual graphs here, we get graphs, whose flags are graphs on their own, whose flags are also graphs, and so on. This explains the terms nested graphs and nested operads.

The following observation gives a simple way to define such "nested" graphs: if a variety L has a marked subvariety M, which in turn has a marked subvariety N, then N is also a marked subvariety of L; on the other hand it cannot happen that L is a marked subvariety of M.

The transitivity property of inclusion lets us model nested graphs as categories: objects correspond to subvarieties, morphisms to inclusions. The requirement that we do not have cycles implies that these categories have to be direct, i.e. without non trivial composable sequences of morphisms, starting and ending at the same point.

As with the dual graphs of curves, the hard part in defining the corresponding theory of operads is not in the definition of graphs, but in the definition of morphisms between graphs (see [\cite=BM08] for the 1-dimensional case).

Defining the category of nested graphs is one of the main goals of this paper. Actually it is a double category, reflecting the fact that we should not only know how to glue varieties, but also how to embed one into another.

The other goal is to describe the additional structure on the resulting category, that allows us to define nested operads. In the 1-dimensional case it is a monoidal structure, given by disjoint union, and it lets us define operads of all kinds as representations of the category of graphs, i.e. as monoidal functors Γ  →  G, where Γ is the category of labeled graphs, that we chose, and G is any monoidal category (see [\cite=BM08] for details).

In the nested case, the structure is more complicated. Given two varieties U and V, we can glue them along 0-dimensional subvarieties, or 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional and so on. Having just one monoidal product on the category of nested graphs is not enough.

Instead of several monoidal products we use one action of the club of simplicial sets [formula]. The corresponding definitions are given in [\cite=Bo10]. This allows us to define nested operads as representations of categories of labeled nested graphs, i.e. as functors NΓ  →  G, where G is also a [formula]-algebra, and the functor respects the action of [formula].

The category of nested graphs

is a small category N, s.t. there is at least one functor (a grading)

[formula]

where [formula] is a finite ordinal and G maps non-identity morphisms to non-identity morphisms.

To simplify our dealings with nested graphs we introduce some terminology in the following definition. It is obviously modeled on the terminology, used in the theory of usual graphs.

To make the connection we would like to note that 1-dimensional graphs are a special kind of nested ones, namely those that have a grading into the ordinal   =  {0,1}. Here vertices are objects in G- 1(1), flags are the non-identity morphisms, and two flags build up an edge (or a hyper-edge for more than two), if the corresponding morphisms have the same domain.

A flag in a nested graph is a non-identity morphism. An irreducible flag is a flag, that cannot be written as a composition of two flags.

Objects in a nested graph will be called nodes. We consider every flag as being decorated by its domain. If a node is the codomain of a flag, we will say that the flag is attached to the node.

A vertex in a graph is a node, that does not decorate any flag. A corolla is a nested graph with a unique vertex.

A functor φ:N1  →  N2 contracts a flag f∈Mor(N1) if φ(f) is an identity. A node A is contracted by a functor, if it decorates a flag, that is contracted.

It is clear that in a 1-dimensional graph all flags are irreducible. In dimension higher than 1 we obviously have reducible flags, e.g. a marked point belonging to a surface can also belong to a marked curve on that surface.

We will define morphisms between nested graphs using functors between the categories. However, not all functors will be allowed.

A functor φ:N1  →  N2 will be called admissible if:

for any irreducible flag f∈N1, φ(f) is either identity or an irreducible flag,

for any irreducible flag f:A  →  B in N1, if φ contracts f, it contracts all irreducible flags, decorated by A.

Geometric meaning of these conditions is obvious:

If we have a variety U, and a marked subvariety V  ⊂  U, s.t. there is no marked subvariety in between, then after gluing U with anything, this property remains, i.e. gluing cannot insert anything between U and V.

If we glue several varieties {Ui} along a marked subvariety V  ⊂  Ui, then after gluing, V ceases to be marked in all of Ui's. In other words, when we contract an edge (or a hyper-edge), we contract all flags involved.

The following lemma is immediate.

Composition of two admissible functors is admissible.

In [\cite=BM08] it is shown that any morphism between 1-dimensional graphs can be uniquely written as a composition of a grafting, followed by merger, followed by a contraction.

In the higher dimensional case there is no distinction between grafting and merger, since now both ends of flags are just objects in a category. Therefore a morphism between nested graphs will be defined as a merger, followed by a contraction.

A merger μ:N1  →  N2 is an admissible epi-functor, s.t. N2 is a quotient of N1 by an equivalence relation on objects of N1.

A contraction κ:N1  →  N2 is an admissible epi-functor, s.t. for every node A2∈N2, the fiber κ- 1(A2) is a corolla.

Composition of mergers is a merger, composition of contractions is a contraction.

It is obvious that compositions of mergers are mergers. To prove the statement for contractions, consider a contraction κ:N1  →  N2, let A2∈N2 be any node, and let A1∈N1 be the only vertex in κ- 1(A2). We claim that for any flag f2:A2  →  B2 in N2 there is a flag f1:A1  →  B1 in N1, s.t. κ(f1) divides f2.

Indeed, since κ(N1) generates all of N2, there is a flag g1∈N1, that is not contracted by κ, s.t. κ(g1) is decorated by A2 and κ(g1) divides f2. Moreover, we can choose g1 to be irreducible. Then, since κ is admissible, the domain of g1 cannot be contracted by κ, and therefore g1 has to be decorated by A1.

Now let [formula] be two contractions, and let A3∈N3 be any node. Let A2∈N2 be the only vertex in κ- 12(A3), and let A1 be the only vertex in κ- 11(A2). We claim that A1 is the only vertex in κ- 11(κ- 12(A3)).

Indeed, Let B2∈κ- 12(A3) be any node different from A2. Since A2 is the unique vertex in κ- 12(A3), there is a flag f2∈N2, decorated by B2, s.t. it is contracted by κ2. Let B1 be the unique vertex in κ- 11(B2). As we have seen above, there is a flag f1∈N1, decorated by B1, s.t. κ1(f1) divides f2. Then obviously f1 is contracted by [formula], and therefore B1 cannot be a vertex in κ- 11(κ- 12(A3)).

The previous lemma tells us how to compose mergers with mergers and contractions with contractions. To define compositions of pairs (contraction, merger), we need to know what is a contraction, followed by a merger. The following lemma provides an answer.

Any admissible epi-functor between nested graphs can be written (in a non-unique way) as a composition of a merger, followed by a contraction.

We will not only prove that this is possible, we will construct canonical decompositions, that will be used later to organize nested graphs into a category. We do it by requiring the merger to be as small as possible.

Let φ:N1  →  N2 be an admissible epi-functor. It defines an equivalence relation on Obj(N1) as follows: for A1  ≠  B1, A1  ~  B1 iff φ(A1) = φ(B1) and both A1 and B1 are vertices in φ- 1(φ(A1)). Let N'2 be the category, obtained by identifying equivalent nodes in N1, and morphisms being freely generated by morphisms in N1, subject to relations of composition in N1.

In addition to projection μ:N1  →  N'2, there is an obvious κ:N'2  →  N2, s.t. [formula]. It is clear that both μ and κ are epi-functors. We claim that N'2 is a nested graph, μ is a merger, and κ is a contraction.

Suppose N'2 is not a nested graph, i.e. there is a cycle of flags [formula]. Since μ is an epi-functor, we can assume that [formula], for some f(i)1:A(i)1  →  B(i)1 in N1. Since N1 is a direct category there is an i, s.t. B(i)1  ≠  A(i + 1)1. However, μ(B(i)1) = μ(A(i + 1)1), because f(i)2 and f(i + 1)2 are composable. Then, by definition of μ, B(i)1 and A(i + 1)1 are vertices in the same fiber of φ, but f(i + 1)1 is contracted by φ, since f(i + 1)2 is contracted by κ (N2 is a direct category), so A(i + 1)1 cannot be a vertex - contradiction.

Since μ is defined by identifying nodes, it is clearly a merger. Let A2∈N2 be a node. The fiber κ- 1(A2) has a unique vertex, because it is obtained by identifying all vertices in φ- 1(A2).

It remains to prove that κ is an admissible functor. It is immediately obvious that irreducible flags in N'2 are precisely the images under μ of irreducible flags in N1. Therefore, it is clear that κ maps irreducible flags to irreducible flags.

Let f2:A2  →  B2 be an irreducible flag, that is contracted by κ. Then there is an irreducible flag f1:A1  →  B1 in N1, contracted by φ, and s.t. μ(f1) = f2. Clearly A1 is a not a vertex in a fiber of φ, and therefore, by definition of μ, μ- 1(A2) = A1, and consequently κ contracts all irreducible flags, decorated by A2.

NGr is defined as follows:

Objects are nested graphs, as in Definition [\ref=DefinitionGraph].

Morphisms from N1 to N2 are pairs [formula], where μ is a merger and κ is a contraction, as in Definition [\ref=DefinitionMerCon].

Composition [formula] is (κ2κ',μ'μ1), where (κ',μ') is the decomposition (according to Lemma [\ref=LemmaDecomposition]) of μ2κ1.

Defined as above, NGr is a category.

Let [formula] be 3 morphisms. We would like to prove that the two possible compositions coincide. Since composition of mergers is just composition of functors, it is easy to see that we can assume μ1 to be trivial. Similarly we can assume κ3 being trivial. Therefore, all we have to prove is that

[formula]

We will start with a simplification: let κ be a contraction, and let μ1, μ2 be mergers. We claim

[formula]

Let's denote [formula] by (κ',(μ2μ1)'), and [formula] by (κ'',μ'2μ'1). In construction of (μ2μ1)' we identify vertices in κ-fibers over nodes, that are identified by μ2μ1; on the right hand side this identification is split in two steps - first we identify according to μ1, and then μ2. Clearly (μ2μ1)' = μ'2μ'1, and hence ([\ref=Mergers]) is true, since any decomposition of a given admissible epi-functor into a merger, followed by a contraction, is determined by the merger.

Equation ([\ref=Mergers]) implies that in ([\ref=Associativity]) we can assume μ2 to be trivial. And hence the problem is reduced to proving that for any contractions κ1,κ2 and a merger μ we have

[formula]

Let A be a node in the domain of μ, let B be the vertex in κ- 12(A). The fiber (κ2κ1)- 1(A) is a corolla, its vertex is the vertex C in κ- 11(B). If μ identifies A and A', then the merger μ', obtained by commuting μ and κ2κ1, identifies C and C'.

On the right hand side we have two steps: first we identify B and B', and then C and C'. The result is clearly the same, and so we obtain the same merger on both sides of ([\ref=Contractions]), and therefore the same contraction.

Finally, identities in NGr are obviously pairs where both the merger and the contraction are the identity functors.

It is easy to check that the full subcategory of NGr, consisting of nested graphs that have a grading into [formula], is precisely the category of usual (hyper-) graphs. If we impose an additional condition that there are at most two morphisms sharing a domain (i.e. if we allow only edges, but no hyper-edges), we obtain the category Gr from [\cite=BM08].

In the next section we introduce an action of the club of simplicial sets on the category NGr. To do this we will need to keep track of inclusions of graphs into other graphs (this is to define the "amalgamation" in the "amalgamated" products).

So here we extend the category structure on NGr to a double category. This is also present in the 1-dimensional case Gr, but is not used there, since one can get along without the action of simplicial sets.

N is a subcategory N'  ⊆  N, s.t. if a node belongs to N', so do all the flags attached to it.

The category of objects [formula] has nested graphs as objects, and given two nested graphs M,N, a dependency [formula] is an injective functor δ:M  →  N, s.t. δ(M) is a full subgraph of N.

The category of morphisms [formula] has morphisms between nested graphs as objects, and its morphisms are commutative diagrams

[formula]

s.t.

[formula]

It is straightforward to check that compositions of morphisms are compatible with the source, domain and the identity functors, i.e. that we have a double category structure on NGr.

Action of simplicial sets

In [\cite=Bo10], it is shown that the category of simplicial sets [formula] has the structure of a club. Moreover, it is shown that the subcategory [formula], consisting of injective maps, is also a club (with respect to a restricted semi-direct product).

Here we extend the monoidal structure on Gr, used in [\cite=BM08], to a full action of [formula]. At the end of the section we use this fact to define nested operads in any [formula]-algebra.

There is an action of [formula] on [formula], [formula], compatible with the double category structure.

It is easy to see that corollas are generators for the category [formula], and that morphisms with corollas as codomains are generators for [formula]. Using these generators we define [formula], [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula] map generators to generators, we have [formula], [formula] for all k  ≥  0. It is straightforward to check that conditions ([\ref=CondMorDep]) imply the same for σ.

Now we define functors [formula] and [formula]. Here we use the canonical action of SSet on Cat, given by taking colimits. We have to prove that, taking a colimit of a simplicial diagram in [formula], we get a nested graph as the result. This becomes obvious if we choose a common grading on each member of the diagram, and hence the colimit becomes graded itself.

Given a simplicial diagram in [formula], we can write it as a composition of a diagram of mergers and a diagram of contractions. Taking colimits separately, we get three nested graphs and two functors between them. While it is straightforward to see that colimit of mergers is a merger, we have to prove that colimit of contractions is a contraction.

First we show that colimit of admissible functors is admissible. Let [formula] be an object in [formula], and let N be its colimit (in Cat). It is easy to see that irreducible flags in N are given as equivalence classes of irreducible flags in members of [formula]. Therefore, if [formula] consists of admissible functors, the corresponding φ:N  →  N' maps irreducible flags to irreducible flags.

Next we make the following observation: let A be a node in N, if A is a vertex in a φ-fiber, then any pre-image of A with respect to [formula] is a also a vertex in its [formula]-fiber. Moreover, conditions ([\ref=CondMorDep]) imply that this is necessary and sufficient, i.e. if A is not a φ-vertex, none of its pre-images in [formula] is a [formula]-vertex. It immediately follows that φ is admissible, if every component of [formula] is admissible.

Now suppose that every component of [formula] is a contraction, but φ is not a contraction, i.e. there is a node A∈N', s.t. φ- 1(A) has at least two vertices, call them B1 and B2. Let C1, C2 be any pre-images of B1, B2 in [formula]. Clearly [formula], [formula] have to be glued together in N'. This gluing is performed by a sequence of nodes in [formula], and taking pre-images of these nodes in [formula], we conclude that C1, C2 have to be glued together as well.

So far our construction was defined only for objects of [formula] and [formula]. To extend it to functors we need to show that colimits of morphisms in [formula], [formula] are morphisms in [formula], [formula] respectively. This is a direct consequence of the definition of morphisms in [formula], [formula], i.e. them being fibrations ([\cite=Bo10]).

Finally, associativity of [formula], [formula] follows immediately from associativity of the canonical action of SSet on Cat.

is a double category NΓ, having a compatible (partial) action of [formula], and a double functor ψ:NΓ  →  NGr, preserving the action of [formula], s.t. ψ- 1(NGr) generates NΓ as a [formula]-algebra.

Given any double category G, with an action of [formula], an NΓ-operad in G is a double functor NΓ  →  G, with contravariant components, preserving the action of [formula].

An example of a double category G having an action of [formula] is any category G with limits, considered as a double category, with the category of objects being G itself, and the category of morphisms being Mor(G) (i.e. objects are morphisms in G, morphisms are commutative squares in G).

In this way we can recover the globular operads from [\cite=Ba98] as a particular case of our construction.
