Introduction

Throughout R is a commutative noetherian ring. Generalized local cohomology was given in the local case by J. Herzog [\cite=He] and in the more general case by M.H Bijan-Zadeh [\cite=BZ]. Let [formula] denote an ideal of a ring R. The generalized local cohomology defined by

[formula]

This concept was studied in the articles [\cite=S], [\cite=He] and [\cite=Ya]. Note that this is in fact a generalization of the usual local cohomology, because if M = R, then [formula]. Important problems concerning local cohomology are vanishing, finiteness and artinianness results (see [\cite=Hu]).

In Section 2 we show in [\ref=T:kofinlc] that if M is finite and all generalized local cohomology modules [formula] are coatomic for all i < n, then they are finite for all i < n. In fact this is another condition equivalent to Falting's Local-global Principle for the finiteness of generalized local cohomology modules (see [\cite=AK]). In Theorem [\ref=T:yo] we generalize Yoshida's theorem ( [\cite=Yo]).

In Section 3, We prove in [\ref=T:mmart], that when M is a finite R-module of finite projective dimension such that the generalized local cohomology modules [formula] are minimax modules for all i  ≥  r, (where [formula]) then they must be artinian.

For unexplained terminology we refer to [\cite=BSh] and [\cite=BH].

Finiteness and vanishing

An R-module M is called coatomic when each proper submodule N of M is contained in a maximal submodule [formula] of M (i.e. such that [formula] for some [formula]). This property can also be expressed by [formula] or equivalently that any artinian homomorphic image of M must have finite length. In particular all finite modules are coatomic. Coatomic modules have been studied by Zöschinger [\cite=Zrko].

Let R be a noetherian ring, [formula] an ideal of R and M,N finite R-modules. The following statements are equivalent:

[formula] is coatomic for all i < n.

[formula] for all i < n.

[formula] is finite for all i < n.

By [\cite=AK] and[\cite=Zrko] we may assume that [formula] is a local ring.

⇒   (ii) It is trivial by the definition of coatomic modules.

⇒   (iii) By [\cite=Zrkoass] there is t  ≥  1 such that [formula] is finite for all i < n. Therefore there is s  ≥  t such that [formula] for all i < n, and apply [\cite=AK].

⇒   (i) Any finite R-module is coatomic.

The following results are generalizations of [\cite=Yo].

Let [formula] be a local ring, [formula] be an ideal of R and M be a finite module of finite projective dimension. Let N be a finite module and [formula]. If [formula] is finite for all i  ≥  r, then [formula] for all i  ≥  r.

We prove by induction on d =  dim N. If d = 0, By [\cite=Ya], it follows that [formula] for all [formula] and so the claim clearly holds for n = 0. Now suppose d > 0 and [formula] for all i > r. It is enough to show [formula]. First suppose [formula]. Take [formula] which is N-regular. Then dim N  /  xN  =  d - 1. The exact sequence

[formula]

induces the exact sequence

[formula]

It yields that [formula] for all i > r. Hence by induction hypothesis we get [formula]. Thus we have [formula] by Nakayama's lemma. Next suppose [formula]. Put [formula]. Since L have finite length, so we have dim L = 0 and therefore [formula] for all [formula] . But from the exact sequence

0  →  L  →  N  →  N / L  →  0

we get the exact sequence

[formula]

hence we have [formula] for all [formula], and we get the required assertion from the first step.

Let [formula] be an ideal of R and M a finite R-module of finite projective dimension. Let N be a finite R-module and [formula]. The following statements are equivalent:

[formula] for all i  ≥  r.

[formula] is finite for all i  ≥  r.

[formula] is coatomic for all i  ≥  r.

(i)  ⇒  (ii)  ⇒  (iii) Trivial. (iii)  ⇒  (i) By use of theorem [\ref=T:yo] and [\cite=Zrko] we may assume that [formula] is a local ring. Note that coatomic modules satisfy Nakayama's lemma. So the proof is the same as in theorem [\ref=T:yo].

In the following corollary [formula] denote the supremum of i's such that [formula].

Let [formula] an ideal of R, M a finite R-module of finite projective dimention and N a finite R-module. If [formula], then [formula] is not coatomic in particular is not finite.

Artinianness

Recall that a module M is a minimax module if there is a finite (i.e. finitely generated) submodule N of M such that the quotient module M / N is artinian. Thus the class of minimax modules includes all finite and all artinian modules. Moreover, it is closed under taking submodules, quotients and extensions, i.e., it is a Serre subcategory of the category of R-modules. Minimax modules have been studied by Zink in [\cite=Zi] and Zöschinger in [\cite=Zrmm] [\cite=Zrrad]. See also [\cite=Ru].

Let M and N be two R-module. If f:R  →  S is a flat ring homomorphism, then

[formula]

It is easy and we lift it to the reader.

Let [formula] an ideal of R and M a finite R-module of finite projective dimension. Let N be a finite R-module and [formula]. If [formula] is a minimax module for all i  ≥  r, then [formula] is an artinian module for all i  ≥  r.

Let [formula] be a non-maximal prime ideal of R. Then by the definition of minimax module and lemma [\ref=L:flat] [formula] is a finite [formula]-module for all i  ≥  r. By theorem [\ref=T:yo], [formula] for all i  ≥  r, thus [formula] for all i  ≥  r. By [\cite=Ru], [formula] is artinian for all i  ≥  r.

Let [formula] denote the supremum of the i's such that [formula] is not artinian with the usual convention that the supremum of the empty set of integers is interpreted as -    ∞  .

Let [formula] an ideal of R, M a finite R-module of finite projective dimension and N a finite R-module. If [formula], then [formula] is not minimax in particular is not finite.
