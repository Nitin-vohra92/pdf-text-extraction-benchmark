Appendix to V. Mathai and J. Rosenberg's paper "A noncommutative sigma-model"

This short note is an appendix to [\cite=MR].

Let [formula]. Denote by Aθ the rotation C*-algebra generated by unitaries U and V subject to UV = e2πiθVU, and by A∞θ its canonical smooth subalgebra. Denote by tr the canonical faithful tracial state on Aθ determined by tr(UmVn) = δm,0δn,0 for all [formula]. Denote by δ1 and δ2 the unbounded closed *  -derivations of Aθ defined on some dense subalgebras of Aθ and determined by δ1(U) = 2πiU, δ1(V) = 0, and δ2(U) = 0, δ2(V) = 2πiV. The energy [\cite=Rosenberg], E(u), of a unitary u in Aθ is defined as

[formula]

when u belongs to the domains of δ1 and δ2, and ∞   otherwise.

Rosenberg has the following conjecture [\cite=Rosenberg].

For any [formula], in the connected component of UmVn in the unitary group of A∞θ, the functional E gets minimal value exactly at the scalar multiplies of UmVn.

For a *  -endomorphism φ of A∞θ, its energy [\cite=MR], L(φ), is defined as 2E(φ(U)) + 2E(φ(V)). Mathai and Rosenberg's Conjecture 3.1 in [\cite=MR] about the minimal value of L(φ) follows directly from Conjecture [\ref=unitary:conj].

Denote by H the Hilbert space associated to the GNS representation of Aθ for tr, and denote by [formula] its norm. We shall identify Aθ as a subspace of H as usual. Then ([\ref=energy:eq]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Now we prove Conjecture [\ref=unitary:conj], and hence also prove Conjecture 3.1 of [\cite=MR].

Let [formula] and [formula]. Let u∈Aθ be a unitary whose class in K1(Aθ) is the same as that of UmVn. Then E(u)  ≥  E(UmVn), and "=" holds if and only if u is a scalar multiple of UmVn.

We may assume that u belongs to the domains of δ1 and δ2. Set aj = u*δj(u) for j = 1,2. For any closed *  -derivation δ defined on a dense subset of a unital C*-algebra A and any tracial state τ of A vanishing on the range of δ, if unitaries v1 and v2 in the domain of δ have the same class in K1(A), then τ(v*1δ(v1)) = τ(v*2δ(v2)) [\cite=PW]. Thus

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and "=" holds if and only if aj  =  tr(aj). It follows that E(u)  ≥  2π2(m2 + n2), and "=" holds if and only if δ1(u) = 2πimu and δ2(u) = 2πinu. Now the theorem follows from the fact that the elements a in Aθ satisfying δ1(a) = 2πima and δ2(a) = 2πina are exactly the scalar multiples of UmVn.

When [formula] is irrational, the C*-algebra Aθ is simple [\cite=Slawny], has real rank zero [\cite=BKR], and is an [formula]-algebra [\cite=EE]. It is a result of Elliott that for any pair of [formula]-algebras with real rank zero, every homomorphism between their graded K-groups preserving the graded dimension range is induced by a *  -homomorphism between them [\cite=Elliott]. The graded dimension range of a unital simple [formula]-algebra A is the subset [formula] of the graded K-group [formula] [\cite=Rordam]. It follows that, when θ is irrational, for any group endomorphism ψ of K1(Aθ), there is a unital *  -endomorphism φ of Aθ inducing ψ on K1(Aθ). It is an open question when one can choose φ to be smooth in the sense of preserving A∞θ, though it was shown in [\cite=BCEN] [\cite=CEGJ] that if θ is irrational and φ restricts to a *  -automorphism of A∞θ, then ψ must be an automorphism of the rank-two free abelian group K1(Aθ) with determinant 1. When ψ is the zero endomorphism, from Theorem [\ref=min:thm] one might guess that L(φ) could be arbitrarily small. It is somehow surprising, as we show now, that in fact there is a common positive lower bound for L(φ) for all 0 < θ < 1. This answers a question Rosenberg raised at the Noncommutative Geometry workshop at Oberwolfach in September 2009.

Suppose that 0 < θ < 1. For any unital *  -endomorphism φ of Aθ, one has [formula].

Theorem [\ref=lower_bound:thm] is a direct consequence of the following lemma.

Let [formula] and let u,v be unitaries in Aθ with uv = λvu for some [formula]. Then [formula].

We have

[formula]

and hence tr(uv) = 0. Thus

[formula]

We may assume that both u and v belong to the domains of δ1 and δ2. For any [formula], denote by am,n the Fourier coefficient [formula] of u. Then a0,0  =  tr(u), and

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly, [formula].

Write [formula] and [formula] as t and s respectively. We just need to show that [formula]. If t  ≥  1 or s  ≥  1, then this is trivial. Thus we may assume that 1 - t,1 - s > 0. Then

[formula]

Equivalently, t(1 - s)  ≥  1 - (t + s). Without of loss generality, we may assume s  ≥  t. Write t + s as w. Then

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

It follows that w2 - 6w + 4  ≤  0. Thus [formula].
