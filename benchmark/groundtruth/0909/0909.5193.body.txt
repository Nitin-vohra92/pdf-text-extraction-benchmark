The relation between Δν and [formula] for solar-like oscillations

Introduction

Simple scaling relations for asteroseismic quantities have proven very useful when analysing stellar oscillations. In particular, relations for scaling the quantities [formula] [\citep=Brown91] and Δν [\citep=Ulrich86] from the Sun have been widely used to constrain stellar global parameters, or simply to verify the asteroseismic signal of stars that already had well-constrained stellar parameters. Here, [formula] is the frequency of maximum power of the oscillations, and Δν is the sol-called large frequency separation between consecutive overtones. For the Sun, [formula] [formula]Hz and Δν [formula]Hz.

Over the past decade, detections of solar-like oscillations in other stars have been growing in number [\citep=Aerts08] [\citep=BeddingKjeldsen08], and the CoRoT space mission has caused a recent surge [\citep=Michel08] [\citep=Ridder09]. This flow of data is expected to increase to a flood with the Kepler mission [\citep=Dalsgaard08]. For many stars, knowing Δν or [formula] can help constrain the stellar parameters considerably [\citep=Stello08] [\citep=Kallinger08a] [\citep=Stello09] [\citep=Miglio09] and hence yield important new insights into stellar structure and evolution, even without a full asteroseismic analysis. In addition, recent developments of automated software for asteroseismic data analysis benefit from knowing a simple relation between Δν and [formula] [\citep=Mathur09] [\citep=Huber09] [\citep=Hekker09].

In this Letter we investigate the relation between Δν and [formula], building on previous studies to show how these two quantities are related to each other and to the global stellar parameters. We also carry out stellar model calculations to support this investigation, including a comparison of stellar models with the established scaling relations for Δν and [formula].

The observed relation

Table [\ref=tab1] shows published measurements of Δν and [formula] for 55 stars including the Sun. In some cases, where the value of [formula] was not specified, we have estimated it from the published power spectra. The location of the stars in the H-R diagram are shown in Fig. [\ref=f0].

In Fig. [\ref=f1] we plot Δν versus [formula] for the data listed in Table  [\ref=tab1]. We see a remarkably tight relation over nearly three orders of magnitude. A power-law fit gives

[formula]

The two stars that deviate the most from this relation are η  Ser and ξ  Hya. In both cases, there are reported ambiguities in the determination of the large separation, which could explain the deviation. Apart from those two cases, all stars in Fig. [\ref=f1] fall within + 10 per cent and - 15 per cent of the fitted relation, while the main sequence stars alone fall within [formula] per cent. We note that [\citet=Hekker09] have confirmed the tight correlation for a sample of several hundred red giants observed by CoRoT, which also seems to indicate a tendency for some stars to fall below the relation.

Scaling relations

Can previously published scaling relations for Δν and [formula] explain the observed relation between them? It is well-established [\citep=Ulrich86] that, to a good approximation, Δν is proportional to the square root of the stellar density:

[formula]

Also, following [\citet=Brown91] and [\citet=KjeldsenBedding95], we expect [formula] to scale as the acoustic cut-off frequency, [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

where it is observed for the Sun that [formula] [\citep=BalmforthGough90] [\citep=Fossat92]. Given that Δν and [formula] scale differently with stellar parameters, the tightness of the correlation in Fig. [\ref=f1] is perhaps surprising. To understand this, we raise Eq. ([\ref=numaxsc]) to the power a and divide by Eq. ([\ref=dnusc]) which, after rearranging, gives

[formula]

The tight relation in Fig. [\ref=f1] leads us to conclude that the scaling factor in square brackets in Eq. ([\ref=dnunumaxrel]) must be approximately constant when a = 0.77. Indeed, this is easy to see because that value of a eliminates almost completely the parameter that varies the most over the stars being considered, namely L, and leaves a very weak dependence on M and [formula]. This is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=f8], which shows the scaling factor for the observed value a = 0.77. The scaling factor indeed covers a band 25 per cent wide for the region sampled by the stars (see Fig. [\ref=f0]), in agreement with the + 10 to - 15 per cent deviation shown by the observational data in Fig. [\ref=f1]. Figure [\ref=f8] further supports the lower scatter observed for the main sequence stars and the higher, slightly skewed, scatter for red giants. We have determined the value of a that minimizes the spread in the scaling factor and found that it depends slightly on the stellar parameter range that we consider. For example, consideration of the entire model grid requires a = 0.78, while considering only ZAMS models gives a = 0.75.

Models

We now expand our investigation of the Δν-[formula] relation using two sets of stellar models. One is a dense grid, comprising over a million models derived using the Aarhus stellar evolution code astec [\citep=DalsgaardAstec08] and the adiabatic pulsation code adipls [\citep=DalsgaardAdipls08]. This grid is slightly expanded in parameter space but otherwise identical to the one constructed by [\citet=Stello09] (see references herein). The other is a set derived using the Yale code yrec [\citep=Demarque08] with mixing-length parameter α = 1.80, initial hydrogen abundance X = 0.707, and metallicity Z = 0.018. Although the set of yrec models is more sparse, with a total of 92 models, it spans almost uniformly the same range in parameter space as the astec grid. The region covered by the models is indicated by the evolutionary tracks in Fig. [\ref=f0].

In addition to the global stellar parameters M, L, and [formula], we calculated for each model the large frequency separation as the inverse of the sound travel time through the star:

[formula]

where c is the sound speed [\citep=Tassoul80] [\citep=Gough86]. We also calculated the acoustic cutoff frequency by assuming an isothermal atmosphere, which gives [\citep=BalmforthGough90]

[formula]

evaluated at the surface (T =  [formula]). Here, H = p / (gρ) is the density scale height, p is pressure, g is gravity, and ρ is density.

In Fig. [\ref=f2] we show a subset of the astec grid for a fixed metallicity (Z = 0.014). Contours of constant - 1 (magenta) are almost parallel to contours of constant c / 2H (cyan), indicating a strong correlation. Hence, knowing one of these two quantities gives a good estimate of the other. This is particularly pronounced in the lower-right corner of the diagram, corresponding to cool main-sequence and subgiant stars. A somewhat weaker correlation is seen in the red giant phase. Note that we neglected the post He-core burning phase, including any mass loss associated with red giant branch evolution. If included, it would blur the contours in this region [\citep=Stello08].

Figure [\ref=f6] shows the relation between Δν and [formula] for the astec models. We find very similar results for the yrec models. Stars hotter than the red edge of the instability strip are generally not expected to exhibit solar-like oscillations and are shown in blue, while cool models are shown in red and grey. We compare the models with observations by fitting a power law with the observed value of a = 0.77 fixed. We see excellent agreement with observations, particularly at low masses (< 1.2  M[formula], red), which is perhaps not surprising since the observations are predominantly from low-mass stars. Interestingly, all cool main-sequence models - high values of [formula] - show a very tight relation, while for more evolved models - lower values of [formula] - the higher mass ones (grey) scatter more and fall below the power-law relation. This agrees with the observations and with the scaling factor in Eq. ([\ref=dnunumaxrel]) (see also Fig. [\ref=f8]). Finally, we found that the theoretical Δν-[formula] relation was not notably sensitive to metallicity. However, it remains to be explained why Δν, which depends on the stellar mean density, correlates so strongly with [formula], which depends on the local conditions in the atmosphere.

Discussion

Several points should be kept in mind when comparing the model calculations with the observations. Firstly, we do not measure [formula] directly in stars and instead rely on its relation to [formula] (see Eq. [\ref=numaxsc]), assuming that [formula]/[formula] does not vary from the solar value. In addition, [formula] can be difficult to define and measure, especially for stars with broad or double-humped envelopes, as seen in Procyon [\citep=BeddingKjeldsen06b] [\citep=Arentoft08]. On the other hand, Δν varies with frequency and mode degree, and its measurement from the power spectrum gives an average that will not be exactly equal to - 1. That said, Fig. [\ref=f6] clearly supports the tight Δν-[formula] relation that we observe.

The preceding comments relate to measuring Δν and [formula] from observations. We should also consider the various ways in which these quantities can be estimated from the models. So far we have used Eqs. ([\ref=dnuint]) and ([\ref=nuaciso]). Here, we derive the large frequency separation and the acoustic cutoff frequency from the models in other ways and investigate any significant systematic differences. The large separation was derived by fitting to 11 consecutive radial orders around [formula], which we denote [formula]. The result for the yrec models (Fig. [\ref=f10], left panel) shows agreement within a few per cent between - 1 and [formula], although we note that the ratio [formula] is always higher than unity. We see similar results for the astec models.

We then tested two additional ways to calculate the acoustic cutoff frequency. Firstly, H was derived from the actual density gradient in the model, but still using Eq. ([\ref=nuaciso]). Secondly we used the full expression [formula] [\citep=BalmforthGough90]. The results are shown in Fig. [\ref=f10] (right panel). Apart from a few hot models that deviate by up to 25 per cent, the agreement is again within a few per cent. For our purpose of investigating the relation between Δν and [formula], a few per cent difference in either quantity is not important, but they should be kept in mind for other applications. Finally, it is interesting to investigate how well the scaling relations for Δν and [formula] (Eqs. [\ref=dnusc] and [\ref=numaxsc]) agree with the model calculations (Eqs. [\ref=dnuint] and [\ref=nuaciso]). Figure [\ref=f3] examines how well - 1 scales with [formula]. For cool models the agreement is particularly good, almost independent of the evolutionary state, while it deteriorates slightly for hot models (those below the blue line). However, we note that - 1 systematically overestimates the large frequency separation for cool models, corresponding to 2-3 per cent for the Sun.

In a similar way Fig. [\ref=f4] shows that the model calculations of c / 2H follow the [formula] scaling from the Sun quite well. The ratio is always below unity because we evaluate c / 2H at the surface defined as T =  [formula], where c / 2H is slightly below its maximum value, which occurs further out in the atmosphere. As with Δν, we conclude that the best agreement is for the cool models. We find similar results for the yrec models.

Conclusions

This Letter points out that the ratio Δν/[formula] varies very weakly with stellar parameters, so that it is essentially constant. Hence, if either one of these parameters is measured, this gives a very useful and robust estimate of the other without any prior knowledge of the stellar global parameters, L, M, [formula], and Z. We anticipate this relation can be used to establish the most plausible large separation in case of ambiguity for datasets where [formula] can be determined. This has already been implemented for automated analysis of Kepler data [\citep=Hekker09a] [\citep=Huber09] [\citep=Mathur09]. In addition, we showed that the well-used scaling relations for Δν and [formula] agree within a few per cent with stellar model calculations for cool models ([formula] [formula]K), from the main sequence to the red giant branch, with a slightly increasing deviation for hotter models.
