Theorem

Linearly-controlled asymptotic dimension of the fundamental group of a graph-manifold

Introduction

A motivation of our work is a result of Bell and Dranishnikov [\cite=BD] that the asymptotic dimension of a graph-group, whose vertex groups have finite asymptotic dimensions, is also finite. The fundamental groups of graph-manifolds are graph-groups. However, it is unclear whethere there exists an analogue of the Bell-Dranishnikov result for the linearly-controlled asymptotic dimension. We present here a construction of suitable coverings for the universal cover of a graph-manifold that allows us to prove the following:

For the fundamental group of a graph-manifold M taken with any word metric and its linearly-controlled asymptotic dimension, we have [formula].

As applications of Corollary [\ref=sle1] and [\cite=LS], we obtain.

Preliminaries

In this section we recall some basic definitions and notations. Let X be a metric space. We denote by |xy| the distance between x,y∈X, and d(U,V): =  inf {|uv||u∈U,v∈V} is the distance between U,V  ⊂  X. We write Br(x) = {x'∈X||xx'|  ≤  r} for the ball with the center x and the radius r. A map f:X  →  Y is said to be quasi-isometric if there exist λ  ≥  1,C  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

for each x,y∈X. Metric spaces X and Y are called quasi-isomeric if there is a quasi-isometric map f:X  →  Y such that f(X) is a net in Y. In this case f is called a quasi-isometry.

We say that a family [formula] of subsets of X is a covering if for each point x∈X there is a subset [formula] such that x∈U. A family [formula] of sets is disjoint if each two sets [formula] are disjoint. The union [formula] of disjoint families Uα is said to be n- colored, where [formula] is the cardinality of [formula].

Also recall that a family [formula] is D-bounded, if the diameter of every [formula] does not exceed D, [formula]. An n-colored family of sets [formula] is r-disjoint, if for every color [formula] and each two sets [formula] we have d(U,V)  ≥  r.

The linearly-controlled asymptotic dimension is a version of the Gromov's asymptotic dimension, [formula].

(Roe [\cite=Roe]) The linearly-controlled asymptotic dimension of a metric space X, [formula], is the least integer number n such that for each sufficiently large real R there exists an (n + 1)-colored, R-disjoint, CR-bounded covering of the space X, where the number C > 0 is independent of R.

A tripod in a geodesic metric space X is a union of three geodesic segments [formula] which have only one common point t. We say that t is the center of the tripod. A geodesic metric space X is called a metric tree if each triangle in it is a tripod (possibly degenerate).

Let T be a metric tree. Recall the well-known construction of 2-colored, r-disjoint, 3r-bounded covering of T (see [\cite=Roe]). Fix some vertex v∈T. Suppose k  ≥  1 is an integer and consider the annuli

[formula]

of the width r and with the center v. For x,y∈Ak we say that x  ~  ky if [formula], where z is the center of the tripod with vertices x,y,v. One can easily check (see [\cite=Roe]) that ~  k is an equivalence relation on Ak. We will make use of the following 2-colored covering: [formula] where [formula] consists of the ball Br(v) and the equivalence classes for ~  k corresponding to all even k. The family [formula] consists of the equivalence classes for ~  k corresponding to all odd k. It is shown in [\cite=Roe] that this covering is r-disjoint and 3r-bounded. We call it the standard (r,v)-covering of T.

We also use a modified covering where the ball Br(v) is replaced by the ball Bd(v) with 0 < d  ≤  r. The annuli Ak are replaced by the annuli

[formula]

of the width r and with the center v. Now for each integer k > 1 as well as for k = 1 and d  ≥  r / 2, we introduce on Bk the equivalence relation x  ~  ky iff [formula]. If k = 1 and d < r / 2, then we say that all points in B1 are ~  1-equivalent. As before one can easily check that the modified covering is r-disjoint and 3r-bounded. We call this covering the standard (r,d,v)-covering of T.

Let G be a finitely generated group and S  ⊂  G a finite symmetric generating set for G (S- 1 = S). Recall that a word metric on the group G (with respect to S) is the metric defined by the norm [formula] where for each g∈G its norm [formula] is the smallest number of elements of S whose product is g. In this paper we will consider only finitely generated groups with a word metric.

By a graph-manifold we mean a closed three dimensional manifold which admits a finite cover by a connected orientable manifold that is glued from blocks along boundary tori in a regular way. By a block we mean a trivial S1-fibration over a surface with negative Euler characteristic and nonempty boundary. A gluing of blocks M1 and M2 (possibly M1 = M2) along boundary tori T1  ⊂  ∂M1 and T2  ⊂  ∂M2 is said to be regular, if S1-fibers, coming up from T1 and T2, are not homotopic on the gluing torus.

Fix a Riemannian metric on a graph-manifold M. The following fact is well known [\cite=BBI].

Let Y be a compact metric space with length metric. Let X be a universal cover of Y with the metric lifted from Y. Then X is quasi-isometric to the group π1(Y) with any word metric.

Graph-manifold model

Description of the model

Consider the hyperbolic plane [formula] having a curvature -  κ (κ > 0) such that the side of a rectangular equilateral hexagon θ in the plane [formula] has the length 1. Let ρ be the distance between the middle points of sides, which have a common adjacent side, δ the diameter of [formula]. It is clear that ρ  ≤  2, δ  ≤  3.

We mark each second side of θ (so we have marked three sides) and consider a set [formula] defined as follows. Take the subgroup Gθ of the isometry group of [formula] generated by reflections in (three) marked sides of θ and let [formula] be the orbit of θ with respect to Gθ. Then [formula] is a convex subset in [formula] divided into hexagons that are isometric to θ. Furthermore, the boundary of [formula] has infinitely many connected components each of which is a geodesic line in [formula].

The graph T0 dual to the decomposition of [formula] into hexagons is the standard binary tree whose vertices all have degree three. Any metric space isometric to [formula] will be called a θ- tree. Given a vertex p of T0, we denote by θp the respective hexagon in [formula].

Every boundary line [formula] of [formula] is the union of segments of length one each of which is a side of a hexagon in [formula]. Thus [formula] determines a sequence of vertices of T0 consecutively connected by edges which form a line [formula] in T0.

Consider the line [formula] and its partition into segments [formula]. Then the graph S0 dual to this partition is an infinite tree with all the vertices having degree 2, in particular, S0 is homeomorphic to [formula]. Given a vertex q of S0, we denote by [formula] the respective segment.

Now, we describe the following metric space X.

Recall that a complete geodesic metric space Y is called a [formula]-space, if the following is satisfied: for each triple of points x,y,z∈X and a point t∈yz consider points x̄,, on the plane [formula] such that |xy| = |x̄|, |yz| = ||, |xz| = |x̄| and the point ∈[null], such that |yt| = ||, then we have |xt|  ≤  |x̄|. A [formula]-space is also called an Hadamard space. The spaces [formula] and [formula] are [formula]-spaces, so Xv, [formula] and X are [formula]-spaces too (see for example [\cite=BBI]).

The model X as the universal cover of a closed graph-manifold

Here we construct a closed graph-manifold Q (with [formula]-smooth Riemannian nonpositively curved metric) whose universal cover [formula] is isometric to X.

Let ω be the union of adjacent hexagons [formula]. Denote by [formula] the reflection with respect to the common side [formula] and consider the surface P0, obtained from ω by gluing the marked sides matched by τ. Then P0 is a surface of constant curvature -  κ with geodesic boundary. The boundary ∂P0 consist of 3 components γ1,γ2 and γ3 of length 2. The hexagon vertices subdivide every γi, i = 1,2,3, into a pair of segments of length 1.

Let us mark the images of hexagons' vertices (so, there will be 6 marked points). Note that the universal cover of P0 is isometric to [formula]. Consider the circle S12 of length 2 and mark two diametrally opposite points s1 and s2 on it. For each boundary component γi (i∈{1,2,3}) consider an isometry Φi:γi  →  S12 taking the marked points into the marked points.

Let P: = P0  ×  S12. Consider an isometric copy P' of P. All the elements of P' will be denoted by the same letters but with prime. Let Q be the manifold obtained by gluing P and P' along the boundary tori γi  ×  S12  ⊂  ∂P and S12  ×  γ'i  ⊂  ∂P' according to isometries

[formula]

Note that Q is a graph-manifold the universal cover [formula] of which consist of blocks isometric to [formula]. Any two of these blocks either are disjoint or intersect over a plane covering a torus γi  ×  S12, i∈{1,2,3}. This plane is divided by the lines covering the circles {xi}  ×  S12 and γi  ×  {si} (where xi∈γi and si∈S12 are marked points) into squares with side 1. It is clear that [formula] isometric to X. We recall the following result [\cite=BN].

Any two graph-manifolds have bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic universal covers, in particular, their fundamental groups are quasi-isometric.

It follows from this theorem that for any graph-manifold M its fundamental group π1(M) is quasi-isometric to the fundamental group π1(Q) of the manifold Q which is by Lemma [\ref=lem:qmetric] quasi-isometric to the model X. Therefore, since [formula] is a quasi-isometry invariant (see e.g. [\cite=LS]), we have [formula]. So, to prove Theorem [\ref=teorem] it suffices to show that [formula]. To this end, we construct for each [formula], R > 10 an R-disjoint, CR-bounded 8-colored covering of the model X, where C = 88.

Coverings of the model

We briefly describe the construction of the required covering of X. We fix [formula], R > 10. First, we construct for every block Xu, [formula], a 4-colored, 2R-disjoint, 15R-bounded covering [formula] which is the product of standard 2-colored coverings of the factors in the decomposition [formula]. For different neighboring blocks these covering are compatible (see Lemma [\ref=zz]) and form together 4-colored covering [formula] of X. The covering [formula] is R-disjoint (see Proposition [\ref=u1]), and this is the main result of the current section. However, all the members of [formula] have infinite diameter. Fortunately, every member W of [formula] has a tree-like structure, and we construct in sect. [\ref=susect:adcolors] a 2-colored covering of W similar to the standard 2-colored covering of a tree. Typical W is disconnected having every connected component convex. For technical reasons, it is convenient first to extend every [formula] to a convex [formula] and then to cover [formula] by a 2-colored [formula]. The extension procedure is described in sect. [\ref=subsect:extension]. The convexity plays an important role in proving the properties of [formula]. After that, we forget about the extension [formula] and restrict [formula] to W. In that way, we produce the required 8-colored covering [formula] of X.

Construction of a covering of a block

Put N: = 2R + 1. Consider an arbitrary block [formula]. We choose a brick [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. Consider the standard (N,p)-covering [formula] of the tree T0 (see section [\ref=konstr]). We build a 2-colored covering [formula] of the [formula]-tree as follows: for each set [formula], i∈{1,2} we define the set

[formula]

and consider the families

[formula]

It is clear that the family [formula] is a 2-colored covering of the [formula]-tree. Recall that ρ is the distance between the middle points of two sides of the hexagon [formula], which have a common adjacent side, and δ is its diameter.

Since the covering [formula] is N-disjoint and 3N-bounded, the inequality [formula] implies that the covering [formula] is 2R-disjoint and ((6R + 2)ρ + 2δ)-bounded. Since ρ  ≤  2,δ  ≤  3 and R > 10 we have [formula] so [formula] is 2R-disjoint and 13R-bounded.

Fix a natural d  ≤  N. Consider the standard (N,d,q)-covering [formula] of the tree S0 (see section [\ref=konstr1]). We build a 2-colored covering [formula] of the line [formula] as follows: for each set [formula], i∈{1,2} consider the set

[formula]

and the families

[formula]

It is clear that the family [formula] is a 2-colored covering of [formula]. Note, that since the family [formula] is N-disjoint and 3N-bounded the inequality [formula] implies that the covering [formula] is 2R-disjoint and (6R + 2)-bounded. Since R > 10 we have 6R + 2  ≤  7R, so the covering [formula] is 2R-disjoint and 7R-bounded.

Consider the 4-colored covering

[formula]

of the block Xv where

[formula]

Since the coverings [formula] and [formula] are 2R-disjoint the covering [formula] is also 2R-disjoint, and since the covering [formula] is 13R-bounded and [formula] is 7R-bounded, the covering [formula] is [formula]-bounded, thus it is 15R-bounded. We will call this covering of the block Xv the (N,d)-covering with the initial brick [formula].

Consider the block Xv with the fixed initial brick [formula], and its boundary plane [formula], where [formula] is a boundary line of the [formula]-tree factor of Xv. Let [formula] be the line in the tree T0 that corresponds to [formula] (see section [\ref=ell]), p'∈ the nearest to pv vertex. We denote n: = |pvp'| and put [formula].

Let Xu be the block glued to σ, 1  ≤  d  ≤  N a natural number, [formula] the brick in Xu having the common boundary square with the brick [formula]. We represent the boundary plane σ as the product of the line [formula] and an appropriate boundary line [formula] in the [formula]-tree factor of the block Xu, [formula]. Consider the line [formula] in the tree T0 which corresponds to the line [formula]. Then the vertex pu belongs to [formula]. We choose a vertex p'u of T0 such that the vertex pu is the nearest to p'u point of the line [formula] and the distance |pup'u| is equal to N - d.

The (N,d)-covering [formula] with the initial brick [formula] of the block Xv and the (N,N - k)-covering [formula] with the initial brick [formula] of the block Xu agree on the common boundary plane σ of the blocks Xu and Xv, i.e. for each pair of numbers (i,j)∈{1,2}  ×  {1,2} any two sets [formula] and [formula] either are disjoint or their intersections with σ coincide.

Indeed since the coverings [formula] and [formula] are products of the coverings of the corresponding factors, it is enough to check that the coverings of the factors agree. We have [formula] and the [formula]-factor of the block Xu is glued to the line [formula]. Let [formula] be the line corresponding to the line [formula] in the tree T0. If we consider the line [formula] as an isometric copy of the tree S0 then the standard (N,pv)-covering of the tree T0 induces a covering [formula] on the line [formula] which is a standard (N,N - k,p')-covering. Therefore since the side of the hexagon [formula] lying on [formula] is glued to the segment Iqu of the [formula]-factor of the block Xu, the standard (N,N - k,qu)-covering of this [formula]-factor coincides with the covering [formula]. The case of the other factors is similar.

Constructing compatible coverings of blocks

Recall that T is the canonical simplicial tree with all the vertices having the infinite countable degree. We consider the metric on T with respect to which all the edges have length one. We fix an arbitrary vertex [formula] and call it the root of the tree T. We define the level function [formula] by l(v'): = |vv'|. We build coverings of blocks of the type discussed earlier which agree with the coverings of the neighbor blocks on the common boundary planes (see sect. [\ref=sss]) by induction on the level m.

The base of induction : m = 0. Let [formula] be an arbitrary brick in Xv. Consider the (N,N)-covering with the initial brick [formula] of the block Xv. We denote this covering by [formula].

The induction step: m  →  m + 1. Suppose that we have already built the coverings [formula] which are compatible for all the blocks Xv' such that l(v')  ≤  m. Consider an arbitrary vertex [formula] such that l(u) = m + 1. The block Xu has exactly one boundary plane σ along which it is glued with a block Xw such that l(w) = m. Xw is already covered by [formula] which is an (N,dw)-covering with the initial brick [formula]. Consider the plane [formula] as the product of a boundary line [formula] in the [formula]-tree and the factor [formula]. Let [formula] be the line in T0 corresponding to [formula] (see section [\ref=ell]). We take the vertex p' in [formula] which is the nearest to pw and denote nw: = |pwp'|. Let [formula]. Let [formula] be a brick in Xu having a common boundary square with the brick [formula]. We represent the boundary plane σ as the product of the line [formula] and a boundary line in the [formula]-tree factor of the block Xu, [formula]. Consider the line [formula] in T0 which corresponds to the line [formula]. It is clear that the vertex pu belongs to [formula]. We choose a vertex p'u in T0 such that the vertex pu is the nearest to p'u point on the line [formula] and the distance |pup'u| is equal to N - dw. We denote by [formula] the (N,N - du)-covering of the block Xu with the initial brick [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=zz] that the coverings [formula] and [formula] of the blocks Xw and Xu respectively agree on the boundary plane σ. [formula] is the covering of the type we need so the induction step is completed.

Constructing a covering of the model

Consider the following 4 families of subsets of the model X. For each pair of numbers (i,j)∈{1,2}  ×  {1,2} we denote

[formula]

Moreover, for each pair of numbers (i,j)∈{1,2}  ×  {1,2} we consider the following relation ~  (i,j) on the family [formula]: U  ~  (i,j)V iff there are sets [formula] in the family [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula]. It is clear that ~  (i,j) is an equivalence relation.

We need two facts (see Lemma [\ref=l1] and [\ref=l2]) for the proof of Proposition [\ref=u1].

Given [formula], U  ⊂  Xu, assume that a boundary plane σ  ⊂  Xu meets U, [formula], and separates a point x∈X and U. Then [formula].

Without loss of generality, we assume that [formula]. Then, since the hyperplane σ  ⊂  X is convex, the segment xy meets σ over a point for every y∈U, [formula].

Recall that we represent the block Xu as the product [formula] and also [formula], where [formula], [formula] are members of the appropriate coverings of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Then [formula], where [formula] is a boundary line, and [formula], where [formula], [formula]. For [formula], we have

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula] because [formula], and hence [formula]. Thus in what follows we assume that [formula].

Let [formula] be the initial brick in [formula]. Passing to the tree T0, we denote by U0 the set of all vertices q' in [formula] such that [formula]. Then by the construction of [formula], U0 is the vertex set of a member of the standard (N,p)-covering of the tree T0. Denote this member by U'. There is [formula] such that U' lies in the N-annulus

[formula]

centered at p. We denote by [formula] the line in T0 corresponding to [formula] and pick a vertex p0∈ of T0 such that [formula]. There are at most two such vertices, and we assume that p0∈U' if [formula]. Then the assumption [formula] is equivalent to [formula].

Since [formula], there is a vertex py of T0 such that [formula] and py∈U'. We show that [formula] in T0. The (unique) point p'∈ closest to p separates [formula] into the rays i, i = 1,2. Each of the rays 1, 2 intersects the annulus Ak over a segment, and at least one of them lies in U'. We assume without loss of generality that [formula]. There is a shortest segment   ⊂   between p0 and [formula]. If p0∈1, then   ⊂  1 is a shortest path in T0 between p0 and U'. Thus the length || = d(p0,U') and hence [formula].

It remains to consider the case p0∈2 and 2 is disjoint with U' (the last happens exactly when k > 1 and [formula]. As above, we have [formula]. On the other hand, any path in T0 between p0 and U' passes over p'. Thus [formula].

The geodesic segment ty  ⊂  Xu projects to the geodesic segment [formula] in the factor [formula] of Xu. While moving from [formula] to [formula] along [formula], one passes the segment p0py  ⊂  T0 and [formula] by [formula].

Let [formula] be the segment between t' and [formula] that corresponds to   ⊂  . The length of γ is at most the number of interior vertices of [formula] plus one, thus |γ|  ≤  || - 1. Since |p0py|  ≥  ||, we obtain [formula]. It follows |ty|  ≥  |tz| because both the triangles tt'y and tt'z are flat with right angles at t'. Then moreover [formula].

Suppose σ is the common plane of the blocks Xu and Xu' such that |vu'| < |vu|, where v is the root of T. Assume that [formula], U  ⊂  Xu, is disjoint with σ, [formula]. Then d(U,σ)  ≥  R.

Let [formula] be the initial brick in [formula]. Recall that [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are members of the appropriate coverings of the [formula]-tree [formula] and [formula] respectively. Denote by U0 the set of all vertices [formula] such that the hexagon [formula]. Then U0 is the vertex set of a member U' of the standard (N,p)-covering of the tree T0. There is [formula] such that U' is a subset of the N-annulus

[formula]

centered at p.

Representing [formula], where [formula] is an appropriate boundary line, we let   ⊂  T0 be the line corresponding to [formula]. It follows from the assumption on σ and the construction of the family [formula] that d(p,)  ≤  N and thus [formula] meets every annulus Ak, k  ≥  0. By the assumption, [formula] is disjoint with [formula], hence [formula] is disjoint with any hexagon of [formula] that meets [formula]. Thus [formula] is disjoint with U'. Since [formula] is covered by members of the standard (N,p)-covering of T0 having the same color i∈{1,2} as U' has and the covering is N-disjoint, we have [formula]. Therefore d(U',)  ≥  N / 2. Moreover, N = 2R + 1 is odd and the distance d(U',) is integer, thus we actually have d(U',)  ≥  (N + 1) / 2 = R + 1. Using [formula], we obtain [formula] and thus d(U,σ)  ≥  R.

Suppose that U lies in the block Xu and W lies in the block Xw. We prove the proposition by induction on m = l(u) + l(w).

The base of induction : m = 0. It follows from the assumption d(U,W) < R that U = W, because different members of the family [formula] are N-disjoint.

The induction step: m  →  m + 1. We assume that the assertion is true for all l(u) + l(w)  ≤  m and consider th� case l(u) + l(w) = m + 1. Without loss of generality suppose l(u)  ≤  l(w). Then l(w)  ≥  1. Thus there exists a boundary plane σ in Xw such that l(w') = l(w) - 1 for the block Xw', which is glued to Xw over σ.

We have d(W,σ) < R because U, W are separated by σ. Therefore [formula], since Xw and σ satisfy the conditions of Lemma [\ref=l2]. By Lemma [\ref=l1], [formula] for every x∈U, thus [formula]. There is [formula], W'  ⊂  Xw', such that [formula] by construction of the family [formula], in particular, W' is equivalent to W. Then d(W',U) < R, and thus W' is equivalent to U by the inductive assumption. Hence W is equivalent to U.

Given (i,j)∈{1,2}2, for each equivalence class [formula] of the equivalence relation ~  (i,j) on the family [formula] consider the set [formula]. We denote by [formula] the family of all such sets. Proposition [\ref=u1] implies that the covering

[formula]

of X is 4-colored and R-disjoint. However, [formula] is unbounded, since the diameter of each of its members is infinite.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t]

Extension of the covering members

Let W be a member of the covering [formula]. The sets [formula], [formula], while nonempty, form the equivalence class [formula] which corresponds to W. We have Wu = U  ×  V, where [formula] and [formula] are members of the coverings [formula] and [formula] respectively for some pair (i,j)∈{1,2}  ×  {1,2}.

Recall that U is the union of the hexagons labelled by all the vertices of the tree T0 (see sect. [\ref=subsect:model] for definition of T0 ) lying in a member U' of the standard (N,p)-covering of T0. There is [formula] such that U' is contained in the N-annulus

[formula]

centered at p.

Now, we construct an extension [formula] of U' as follows. For each x∈U' consider the geodesic segment γx = x'x  ⊂  px of length N / 2 (if |px| < N / 2, then k = 0, U' = BN(p), and we define [formula]). We put

[formula]

and define

[formula]

Note that the set [formula] is connected. Indeed, for each [formula] there exist x1,y1∈U' such that x∈γx1,y∈γy1. Let s be the center of the tripod x1,y1,p. Definition of the set U' implies [formula]. There are x'∈px1 and y'∈py1 such that |px'| = |py'| = kN. Then x1x', y1y'  ⊂  U' and either s∈U' or |sx'|, |sy'|  ≤  N / 2. In each case s is connected with x and y by paths in [formula], thus the set [formula] is connected. Then [formula] is convex by Remark [\ref=vyp].

Recall that V is the union of the intervals labelled by all the vertices of the tree S0 (homeomorphic to [formula], see sect. [\ref=s0] for definition of S0) lying in a member V'  ⊂  S0 of the standard (N,d,q)-covering of S0 for some natural d  ≤  N.

We similarly construct an extension [formula] of V'. For each x∈V' consider the segment γx: = x'x  ⊂  qx of length N / 2 (if |qx| < N / 2, then either V' = Bd(q) and we define [formula], or [formula] and d < N / 2, then we define [formula]). Consider the set

[formula]

and define

[formula]

The set [formula] being a segment in S0 is connected. Then [formula] is convex by Remark [\ref=vyp].

Therefore [formula] is a convex subset of Xu. Moreover, [formula] is compact by construction. We call it the extension of the set Wu. Note that similarly to Lemma [\ref=zz] the extensions of the sets Wu and Ww agree for the blocks Xu and Xw having the common boundary plane σ, i.e. their intersections with σ coincide. We call the extension of the set W the union of the extensions of all its block components Wu.

Recall well known fact that for each point x in an Hadamard space X and for each closed convex subset A  ⊂  X there exists the unique point px∈A such that |xpx| = d(x,A) (the point px is called the metric projection x to the set A). The map sending x∈X to its metric projection px∈A is called the projection to A and is a 1-Lipschitz map.

Given x, [formula], we prove that the geodesic segment [formula]. Let Xu, Xv  ⊂  X ([formula]) be the blocks containing x, y respectively. If u = v, then x, [formula] that is convex. Thus we assume that u  ≠  v. The segment xy intersects consecutively the boundary planes [formula] of the blocks [formula] ([formula] for each [formula]) at [formula]. The sets [formula] are convex for all [formula]. Note that for each [formula] the projection of zi to [formula] and to [formula] coincide. Indeed, let [formula] be the nearest point to zi. By construction of [formula], the metric projection of [formula] to σi coincides with [formula], in particular, the projection ti of t to σi belongs to [formula]. Since σi is convex in the Hadamard space X, we have |ziti|  ≤  |zit|, therefore the nearest point in [formula] to zi lies in [formula]. By similar argument with [formula], we see that projections of zi to [formula] and to [formula] coincide. Denote this point by z'i. By convexity of [formula], we have |z'iz'i + 1|  ≤  |zizi + 1| for every [formula], where z0 = z0' = x, zn + 1 = zn + 1' = y, i.e. the curve [formula] has length less or equal to that of xy, hence γ = xy. Thus [formula].

Additional colors

Consider the extension [formula] of a member W of the covering [formula]. Note that for each block Xu such that [formula], the set [formula] is convex, compact and 17R-bounded. The last follows from the fact that [formula] is 15R-bounded and each point [formula] lies at the distance at most R from Wu.

Put c = 18. Similarly to the standard coverings of a metric tree (see section [\ref=konstr]), we construct for every member W of the covering [formula] a 2-colored, R-disjoint, c'R-bounded covering of the extension [formula], where c': = 5c - 2.

Given x∈X, u∈V(T), we use notation [formula] for the geodesic segment xx'  ⊂  X, where x' is the metric projection of x to [formula]. This is well defined because [formula] is convex and thus x' is unique. We fix [formula] such that [formula]. For every [formula] consider the "annulus"

[formula]

We define a relation ~  k on the set Ak saying that x  ~  0y for every x, y∈A0, and for each natural k we put x  ~  ky iff there exists a vertex [formula] such that the geodesic segments [formula], [formula] intersect the set [formula] and

[formula]

Note that x  ~  ky for each x, [formula].

We prove that ~  k is an equivalence relation. Indeed, suppose x  ~  ky and y  ~  kz. Given [formula] [formula], there are [formula] from the definition of ~  k for the pair {x,y} and [formula] for the pair {y,z}. Note that u, w lie on the segment vyv  ⊂  T. Without loss of generality suppose that |uv|  ≤  |wv|. Then the segment [formula] intersects the set [formula], so the points x and z are equivalent too.

Consider the following 2-colored covering of the set [formula]: the sets of the first color are all the equivalence classes of ~  k, where k is even, the sets of the second color are all the equivalence classes of ~  k, where k is odd.

We prove that this covering of [formula] is c'R-bounded. Indeed, assume that [formula], [formula] are equivalent, and let [formula] be a vertex such that the segments [formula], [formula] intersect the set [formula] and

[formula]

For z, [formula] with [formula], [formula] we have [formula], [formula]. Then [formula], and similarly [formula]. Since [formula] is (c - 1)R-bounded, we obtain

[formula]

Now, we prove that the constructed covering of [formula] is R-disjoint. Let U1  ⊂  Ak,U2  ⊂  Al be sets of the same color.

Assume first that |k - l|  ≥  2. Without loss of generality suppose k  ≥  l + 2. If d(U1,U2)  <  R, then |xy| < R for some [formula], [formula]. Note that [formula], thus |zt|  ≤  c(l + 1)R for some [formula], [formula]. Then

[formula]

This contradicts [formula].

Assume now that k = l, [formula], [formula]. It suffices to prove that [formula]. Let [formula] be the center of the tripod abv  ⊂  T. Then any geodesic segment from [formula], [formula] to [formula] passes through [formula] and

[formula]

We show that [formula]. Indeed, suppose that it is not true. Then there are [formula], x2, [formula], [formula] such that |x1x2| < R / 2, |z1z2| < (c(k - 1) + 1 / 2)R. Thus

[formula]

in contradiction with [formula].

Similarly, we have [formula]. It follows from u∈ab  ⊂  T that

[formula]

We restrict the constructed covering of [formula] to [formula], i.e. for each member of the covering consider its intersection with W. The new covering of W is again 2-colored, R-disjoint and c'R-bounded with c' = 5c - 2 = 88. We denote this covering by [formula], [formula].

For each triple of numbers (i,j,k)∈{1,2}3 consider the following 8-colored covering of X,

[formula]

The covering [formula] is c'R-bounded because the families [formula], k = 1,2, are c'R-bounded. We prove that [formula] is R-disjoint. Indeed, let [formula] be two different sets of the same color for some triple of numbers (i,j,k)∈{1,2}3, where [formula]. If W1  ≠  W2, then d(U,V)  ≥  d(W1,W2)  ≥  R, since U  ⊂  W1, V  ⊂  W2, and the families [formula] are R-disjoint. If W1 = W2, then d(U,V)  ≥  R because [formula] is R-disjoint. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=t].

Applications

Let us recall some definitions.

(Assouad [\cite=As]) The Assouad - Nagata dimension of a metric space X, [formula], is the least integer number n such that for each R > 0 there exists an (n + 1)-colored, R-disjoint, CR-bounded covering of the space X, where the number C > 0 is independent from R.

(Buyalo [\cite=Buy2]) The linearly-controlled dimension of a metric space X, [formula], is the least integer number n, such that for each R  ≤  1 there exists an (n + 1)-colored, R-disjoint, CR-bounded covering of the space X, where the number C > 0 is independent from R.

One easily sees that [formula].

Recall that [formula] is the universal cover of the graph-manifold M. A remark to [\cite=LS] implies that [formula], so [formula]. Theorem [\ref=t] implies that [formula], which gives Corollary [\ref=sle1]. However, by Bell-Dranishnikov result (see [\cite=BD]) [formula], which suggests following conjecture.

Corollary [\ref=sle:a] follows from Corollary [\ref=sle1] and [\cite=LS].

A metric space X called Lipschitz n-connected, n  ≥  0, if for each [formula] there exists γ > 0 such that every λ-Lipschitz map f:Sm  →  X permits a γλ-Lipschitz extension :Bm + 1  →  X, where Sm and Bm + 1 are the unit sphere and the unit disk in [formula] respectively.

It is proved in [\cite=BH], that Hadamard spaces are Lipschitz n-connected for each n  ≥  0. Thus the model space X is Lipschitz n-connected for each n  ≥  0. By Corollary [\ref=sle1] the space X has finite Assouad-Nagata dimension. Corollary [\ref=sle2] now follows from [\cite=LS].
