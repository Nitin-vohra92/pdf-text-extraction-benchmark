Introduction

This paper is a continuation of our previous paper [\cite=AndrSk]. There we defined the holonomy groupoid of any singular foliation F on a smooth manifold M. Although this groupoid is a rather ill behaved object, we could define

the convolution algebra A(M,F) of "smooth compactly supported" functions on this groupoid;

the full and reduced C*-algebra of the foliation which are suitable (Hausdorff) completions of this convolution algebra.

A key notion in [\cite=AndrSk] is that of a bi-submersion which will be also of importance here. This is loosely speaking a cover of an open subset of the holonomy groupoid. It is given by a manifold U with two submersions s,t:U  →  M, each of which lifts the leaves of F to the fibers of s and t.

Here, we proceed and construct the longitudinal pseudodifferential calculus for our foliations.

The longitudinal differential operators are very easily defined: They are generated by vector fields along the foliation.

The longitudinal pseudodifferential operators are obtained as images of distributions on bi-submersions with "pseudodifferential singularities" along a bisection:

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V  ⊂  U an identity bisection. Denote by N the normal bundle to V in U and let a be a (classical) symbol on N*. Let χ be a smooth function on U supported on a tubular neighborhood of V in U and let φ:U  →  N be an inverse of the exponential map (defined on the neighborhood of V). A pseudodifferential kernel on U is a (generalized) function [formula] (here p:U  →  M is the composition [formula] where q is the vector bundle projection (x,ξ)  ↦  x - the integral is an oscillatory integral, taken over the vector space N*p(u)).

The principal symbol of such an operator is a homogeneous function on a locally compact space F* which is a family of vector spaces (of non constant dimension).

As in the case of foliations and Lie groupoids (cf. [\cite=Connes0] [\cite=Monthubert-Pierrot] [\cite=Nistor-Weinstein-Xu] [\cite=Vassout]), we show:

The kernel ka defines a multiplier of A(M,F) (more precisely, of the image of A(M,F) in the C*-algebra of the foliation).

Those multipliers form an algebra.

The algebra of pseudodifferential operators is filtered by the order of a. The class of ka only depends up to lower order on the germ of the principal part of a on F*.

Negative order pseudodifferential operators are elements of the C*-algebra (full and therefore reduced) of the foliation.

Zero order pseudodifferential operators define bounded multipliers of the C*-algebra of the foliation.

We therefore have an exact sequence of C*-algebras

[formula]

where Ψ*(M,F) denotes the closure of the algebra of zero order pseudodifferential operators and B is (a quotient of) the algebra C0(S*F) of continuous functions on the "cosphere bundle" which vanish at infinity.

Longitudinally elliptic operators of positive order (i.e. operators whose principal symbol is invertible when restricted to F*) give rise to regular quasi-invertible operators.

We may form a Laplacian of F, which is an example of such a positive order longitudinally elliptic operator. It defines a regular positive self-adjoint multiplier of the C*-algebra, and therefore a positive self-adjoint operator in any non-degenerate representation of C*(F); in particular a self-adjoint element of B(L2(M)).

One can also take coefficients on a smooth vector bundle over M. This allows to build an index theory, which we intend to treat in a subsequent paper.

The paper is organized as follows:

In section 1 we recall basic facts about pseudodifferential calculus: we define distributions on a manifold U with singularities on a submanifold V and state the main classical results that will be used in the subsequent sections, namely:

Such distributions have a principal symbol which is a smooth function in the co-shpere bundle of N*, where N is the normal bundle of V in U.

We discuss pull backs and push forwards (partial integrations) of pseudodifferential distributions.

If V1,V2 are transversal to each other then the product of P1∈P(U,V1) and P2∈P(U,V2) is a well defined distribution; a partial integral gives rise to an element of [formula] whose principal symbol is the product of the principal symbols.

The algebra C∞c(U) is dense in P(U,V).

In section 2, for the convenience of the reader, we briefly recall the framework we introduced in [\cite=AndrSk] and give some slight modifications of results there. We moreover define the "cotangent space" F* together with its natural locally compact topology.

In section 3 we define the longitudinal pseudodifferential operators. Namely, we define an algebra Ψ∞(U,V) of pseudodifferential operators associated with an atlas of bi-submersions U and a family of identity bisections V covering M.

For this algebra to be defined reasonably, one needs to bear in mind the following: In case the foliation is regular (or defined by a Lie groupoid), the longitudinal pseudodifferential operators form a a subalgebra of the multipliers of the groupoid convolution algebra. A general singular foliation may not arise from a Lie groupoid, but it always comes from an atlas of bi-submersions. So, in order for Ψ∞(U,V) to generalize properly the pseudodifferential calculus of the regular case, we define its elements a priori as multipliers of the image of the convolution algebra AU in its Hausdorff completion C*(U).

This is achieved by showing in § 3.3 that every pseudodifferential kernel P∈P(U,V) defines a multiplier U,V(P) of the image of the natural morphism θ:AU  →  C*(U) from AU to its Hausdorff completion. To this end, we need to show in § 3.2 that a non-degenerate representation Π of C*(U) on a Hilbert space H admits an appropriate extension to compactly supported pseudodifferential kernels.

In § 3.5 we show that our pseudodifferential operators have a principal symbol which is a homogeneous function on the subset of non-zero elements in F*. Last, in § 3.6, we show that thus defined, pseudodifferential operators form a *  -algebra.

In section 4 we show that our longitudinal pseudodifferential calculus has the classical ellipticity properties. Namely the existence of parametrices for elliptic operators and the existence of square roots for even order, self-adjoint operators with positive principal symbol.

In section 5 we establish the extension

[formula]

discussed above.

In section 6 we show how our pseudodifferential calculus allows for the Laplacian of a singular foliation to be realized as a self-adjoint element of B(L2(M)).

Generalized functions with pseudodifferential singularities

In this section we recall some well known facts on pseudodifferential distributions and operators.

Symbols

The symbols that we consider are the "classical" or "polyhomogeneous" symbols. Let us briefly recall how they are defined:

Let [formula], V be an open subset of [formula]. For [formula], define the space [formula] of symbols of order (less than or equal to) m to be the set of smooth functions [formula] such that for any compact set K  ⊂  V and any multi-indices [formula] and [formula] there is a constant [formula] such that, for all x∈K and [formula] we have

[formula]

A symbol [formula] is called classical or polyhomogeneous if [formula], where ak are positively homogeneous functions of degree k in the second variable, namely they satisfy ak(x,tξ)  =  tka(x,ξ) for all ξ  ≠  0 and t  >  0. The notation "~  " means that [formula] for all [formula]. Here χ is a cut-off function with χ(ξ)  =  0 if |ξ|  <  1 / 2 and χ(ξ)  =  1 if |ξ|  ≥  1. Note that this property does not depend on the cut-off function χ. We will consider only classical symbols in this paper.

These notions are diffeomorphism invariant, and thus allow to define symbols on vector bundles: given a smooth manifold V and a smooth vector bundle N over V, we may define the space of classical symbols Smcl(V,N) on the bundle N: these are functions a on the total space N which admit an expansion [formula] as above in any chart where the bundle N is trivial.

We will be mostly interested in the subspace Smcl,c(V,N)  ⊂  Smcl(V,N) of symbols whose support is compact on the V direction, i.e. such that there exists a compact subset K in V with a(ξ) = 0 whenever [formula] (p:N  →  V is the bundle projection).

The above definitions extend to give spaces Smcl(V,N;E) and Smcl,c(V,N;E) of symbols with values in a smooth vector bundle E over V (considering E as a subbundle of a trivial bundle).

Pseudodifferential generalized functions and submersions

In order to make our constructions (which use integration) independent on choices of Lebesgue measures, we use densities everywhere. We just indicate which densities one has to take, with no further explanations most of the time.

Distributions transverse to a submersion

Let M,N be manifolds, p:N  →  M a submersion and E a vector bundle on M. Let [formula] be a distribution with compact support on N. It defines a distribution p!P∈C-    ∞c(M;E) by a formula [formula] ([formula]).

Let F be a vector bundle on N. A distribution P∈C-    ∞(N;F) on N is said to be transverse to p if for every [formula], the distribution p!(f.P) is smooth on M. If P is transverse to p, it restricts to a distribution P' on N' = p- 1(M') for every submanifold M' of M. The distribution P' is obviously transverse to the restriction p':N'  →  M' of p.

Generalized functions with pseudodifferential singularities

On a vector bundle.

Let V be a smooth manifold and N a smooth vector bundle over V. A symbol a∈Smcl,c(V,N*;Ω1N*) defines a generalized function of pseudodifferential type on the total space of N which is given by a formal expression (for u∈N):

[formula]

where p:N  →  V is the bundle map and the integral is an "oscilatory integral". This "function" Pa makes sense as a distribution on the total space of N i.e. elements of the dual space of the space of smooth function compact support on the total space of N (actually smooth sections of a suitable bundle of one densities). Furthermore, the image of this distribution along the map p:N  →  V is (defined and) smooth; we may therefore consider Pa as a C∞(V) linear map from C∞c(N;Ω1N)  →  C∞(V) through a formula (for v∈V - here k is the dimension of the bundle N)

[formula]

Integrating along the manifold V we obtain a distribution on the total space of N. We will sometimes write (formally)

[formula]

Almost by definition, the distribution Pa is transverse to the projection p:N  →  M.

Along a submanifold.

Let U be a smooth manifold and V a closed smooth submanifold of U. Denote by N the normal bundle to V.

We will use the tubular neighborhood construction. Let us briefly fix the notation: this is given by a neighborhood U1 of V in U and a local diffeomorphism φ:U1  →  N such that, for v∈V, φ(v) = (v,0) and dφ restricted to V is the identity in the normal direction. More explicitly, note that for v∈V, [formula]; the above condition means that dφv composed with the second projection is the projection TvU  →  Nv = TvU / TvV.

A generalized function on U with pseudodifferential singularity on V is a generalized function, which far from V is smooth, and near V coincides with a generalized function of pseudodifferential type through a tubular neighborhood construction.

In other words P is of the form [formula] where

(U1,φ) is a tubular neighborhood construction as above,

h∈C∞(U),

χ is a smooth "bump" function equal to 1 in a a neighborhood of V and to 0 outside U1;

a∈Smcl(V,N*;Ω1N*) is a (classical) symbol.

Concretely, such a pseudodifferential function is a distribution on U: if f∈C∞c(U;Ω1(TU)), we put

[formula]

The generalized functions on U with pseudodifferential singularities on V form a vector space that will be denoted by P(U,V). We denote by Pc(U,V) those which vanish outside a compact subset of U (i.e. of the form χP where χ∈C∞c(U) and P∈P(U,V)).

Choose a metric on U and thus a trivialization of all densities. Let X be a vector field with compact support on U. The map [formula] is an example of a (pseudo)differential distribution. Note that if X is tangent to V, then [formula]. In other words, qX only depends up to order zero operators on the image of X in the normal bundle.

Let us state a few facts about these generalized functions that we will use extensively:

We may extend the construction of pseudodifferential functions and define pseudodifferential sections of any smooth (complex) vector bundle E over U. These also give rise to distributions as above, i.e. linear mappings on [formula]. We denote by P(U,V;E) the space they form - and Pc(U,V;E) the subspace of those with compact support.

The space of generalized functions with pseudodifferential singularities doesn't depend on the choice of φ:U  →  N with the above requirements.

We immediately deduce:

A pseudodifferential distribution P∈P(U,V;E) is transverse to any submersion p:U  →  M which is transverse to V. [formula]

Notice that the smooth function on [formula] associated with a generalized function P doesn't determine P: if the symbol is a polynomial - then P is differential and is supported by V - i.e. vanishes outside V.

Density of smooth functions

Let P∈P(U,V) be given by a formal formula

[formula]

Let χ1 be a smooth nonnegative function with compact support on [formula] which is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of 0. Put then

[formula]

Then Pn∈C∞c(U) and converges to P in the topology of C-    ∞. Furthermore, for every submersion q:U  →  M' which is transverse to V, and every f∈C∞(U;Ω1 ker dp), the sequence of p!(fPn) of smooth functions on M' converges to p!(fP) in the topology of C∞c(M').

Principal symbol

A generalized function P∈P(U,V) of order m with pseudodifferential singularities has a principal symbol. If P is associated with a symbol a of order m, then the principal symbol σm(P) of P is the homogeneous part of a of order m. It is defined outside the zero section on the total space of N and σm(P)(x,ξ) is a 1-density on N*x (for x∈V and ξ∈N*x non zero). By choosing smoothly a euclidean metric of the bundle N, it can be defined as an element σm(P)∈C∞(S*N), where S*N is the co-sphere bundle of N*.

We have an exact sequence

[formula]

The only thing that has to be proved is that σm(P) only depends on P. This is a classical fact (see e.g. [\cite=Nistor-Weinstein-Xu]). Let us recall this briefly:

We may assume U = N. Then P defines a C∞(V)-linear map C∞c(N)  →  C∞c(V) (using appropriate densities). Let x∈V and ξ∈Nx a non zero covector. Then σm(x,ξ) =  lim τ  →    +    ∞(iτ)- mP(eiτφχ)(x) where φ∈C∞c(N) with derivative ξ at x∈V (the zero point of Nx) along Nx - and χ∈C∞c(N) is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of x.

We may of course add bundles into the picture: if P∈P(U,V;E) then [formula] (for x∈V and ξ∈N*x non zero).

It is easy to see that generalized functions satisfy all the properties of classical pseudodifferential operators. For future reference in this sequel we recall the following one; it is the key ingredient that provides the existence of parametrices for elliptic pseudodifferential operators.

Let [formula] be a sequence of pseudodifferential functions such that Qn - Qn + 1 is of order m - n. Then there exists a pseudodifferential function Q such that Q - Qn is of order m - n for all n.

The principal symbon of qX in example [\ref=vectorfields] is ξ  ↦  i〈X|ξ〉.

Pull-back, push-forward, product

Pull-back (restriction)

Let U and U' be smooth manifolds and V  ⊂  U a closed submanifold. Let p:U'  →  U be a smooth map, transverse to V and put V'  =  p- 1(V). It is a submanifold of U'. Let P∈P(U,V). Locally (near a point of V') we may assume [formula] and p(x',u) = (p(x'),u) for x'∈V' and [formula].

We may then assume that P is given (formally - see equation [\ref=eq12])) by a formula

[formula]

where h is smooth and a is a symbol.

We then define p*P setting (p*P)(x',u) = P(p(x'),u)

Under the identification of the normal bundle N' of V' in U' with p*N, the principal symbol of p*P is given by [formula].

Push-forward (partial integration)

Let U and U' be smooth manifolds and V  ⊂  U a closed submanifold. Let p:U  →  U' be a submersion which restricts to a diffeomorphism p:V  →  V' where V' is a submanifold of U'. Let E' be a vector bundle on U'.

Integration along the fibers of p gives rise to a map [formula] defined by [formula] for [formula]. The principal symbol of p!P is σ'm(x,ξ) = σm(x,p*ξ) where x∈V'≃V, and p* is the (injective) map (TxU' / TxV)*  →  (TxU / TxV)* induced by p.

If p is onto, then p! is onto too.

We may assume that [formula] is the projection and that P is given by a formula

[formula]

We thus get

[formula]

Using a Taylor expansion of the form

[formula]

we find the principal term

[formula]

Since [formula] we find

[formula]

Let P'∈Pc(U',V';E'). One obviously may extend the principal symbol of P' to get a homogeneous section on the normal bundle of V in U. It follows that there exists an operator P1∈Pc(U,V;p*E') such that p!P1 - P' is of order m - 1. Using induction, one constructs a sequence Pn∈Pc(U,V;p*E') such that p!Pn - P' is of order m - n and Pn + 1 - Pn is of order m - n. Using theorem [\ref=smoothing] , one then gets Q such that Q - Pn is of order m - n, whence p!Q - P' is smoothing. Finally, using partitions of the identity, it is obvious that p!:C∞c(U;p*E')  →  Cc(U',E') is onto.

We will also need a slightly more general statement: In the above proposition, we may just assume that p induces a submersion p:V  →  V' where V' is a submanifold of U'. In that case, for [formula], the principal symbol σ'(x',ξ') of p!P is the integral of σ(x,p*x(ξ')) for x running in the fiber [formula] (and p*x:(Tx'U' / Tx'V')*  →  (TxU / TxV)* is the (injective) map induced by (dp)x) ().

To establish this, one may assume [formula], [formula], [formula] and p is the obvious projection [formula].

Obviously, we have [formula] if p:U  →  U' and q:U'  →  U'' are submersions satisfying requirements of (a).

Products

In order to understand the product of pseudodifferential operators in our context, we give the following Lemma. We say that a submersion p:U  →  U' is strictly transverse to a submanifold V  ⊂  U if at any point x∈V we have [formula].

Let U be a manifold, V1,V2 two closed submanifolds of U that are transverse to each other and p:U  →  U' a submersion strictly transverse to both V1 and V2. Then there are charts of U of the form the form [formula] covering [formula], such that [formula] and [formula] and p can be written as (v,ξ,η)  ↦  (v,ξ  +  η).

Notice that V is a manifold due to the transversality of V1 to V2. Then V is covered by charts such that U can be written as U'  ×  T, where [formula] is the fiber of p, and p is the projection. Since T is transverse to V1, for this chart we can write V1  =  U'  ×  {0}. Since V2 is trasversal to V1, it is the graph of a submersion q:V1  →  T; we have V = q- 1({0}), hence we can write [formula] and q the projection. Under these identifications, we found a chart [formula], for which [formula], V2  =  {(x,ξ,η); ξ  =  η} and p(x,ξ,η) = ξ. The result follows by applying the diffoemorphism (v,ξ,η)  ↦  (v,ξ  +  η,η) on [formula].

Let U be a manifold and V1,V2 two closed submanifolds of U that are transverse to each other. Let Pi∈P(U,Vi).

The product P1  ·  P2 makes sense as a distribution on U.

Assume that P1  ·  P2 has compact support. Let p:U  →  U' be a submersion which is both strictly transverse to V1 and V2 and whose restriction to [formula] is injective and proper. Then p!(P1.P2) is a pseudodifferential function. If then σi is the principal symbol of Pi (i  =  1,2), then the principal symbol of p!(P1.P2) is p!(σ1)  ·  p!(σ2).

The statement is local. We may therefore assume [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Also, by an obvious choice of the tubular neighborhood construction, we may write

[formula]

Here, a1 and a2 are classical (polyhomogeneous) symbols.

The product is then given by a formula:

[formula]

which makes perfect sense when f∈C∞c(U).

Due to [\ref=linearization] we can assume [formula], [formula] and p(x,u,v)  =  (x,u + v).

We thus have to compute

[formula]

This is a "classical" oscillatory integral on [formula] which is treated by the usual integration by parts methods. It actually amounts to composing (families indexed by V) of pseudodifferential operators in [formula].

Singular foliations; cotangent space

Foliations, bi-submersions, atlas, *-algebra

Let us first recall some definitions, notation and conventions taken in [\cite=AndrSk].

Foliations

Let M be a smooth manifold. A foliation on M is a locally finitely generated submodule of C∞c(M;TM) stable under Lie brackets.

There is an obvious notion of a pull-back foliation: if (M,F) is a foliation and f:L  ×  M  →  M is the second projection, the pull back foliation f- 1(F) the space of vector fields whose M component as a map from L to C∞c(M,TM) takes its values in F. In the same way, one defines pull back foliations by submersions. See [\cite=AndrSk], subsection 1.2.3.

For x∈M, put Ix  =  {f∈C∞(M):f(x) = 0}. The fiber of F is the quotient Fx  =  F / IxF. The tangent space of the leaf is the image Fx of the evaluation map evx:F  →  TxM.

The spaces Fx and Fx differ on singular leaves: the dimension of Fx is lower semi-continuous and the dimension of Fx is upper semi-continuous. They coincide in a dense open subset of M, namely on points x that lie in a regular leaf.

We get a surjective linear map ex:Fx  →  Fx whose kernel is a Lie algebra [formula].

Bi-submersions, bisections

The main ingredient in the constructions of [\cite=AndrSk] is the notion of bi-submersion that we now recall.

A bi-submersion of (M,F) is a smooth manifold U endowed with two smooth maps s,t:U  →  M which are submersions and satisfy:

s- 1(F) = t- 1(F).

s- 1(F) = C∞c(U; ker ds) + C∞c(U; ker dt).

If (U,tU,sU) and (V,tV,sV) are bi-submersions then (U,sU,tU) is a bi-submersion, as well as (W,sW,tW) where W  =  U  ×  sU,tVV, sW(u,v)  =  sV(v) and tW(u,v)  =  tU(u) ([\cite=AndrSk]).

The bi-submersion (U,sU,tU) is called the inverse of (U,tU,sU) and is noted (U,tU,sU)- 1, or just U- 1; the bi-submersion (W,sW,tW) is called the composition of (U,tU,sU) and (V,tV,sV) and is noted [formula] - or just [formula].

In [\cite=AndrSk] it is shown that there are enough bi-submersions {(Ui,ti,si)}i∈I such that [formula]: For an x∈M, if [formula] form a base of Fx then we can find a neighborhood U of (x,0) in [formula] where the exponential [formula] is defined and such that (U,tU,sU) is a bi-submersion, where sU denotes the first projection. Such a bi-submersion is sometimes called an identity bi-submersion.

Let (Ui,ti,si) (i = 1,2) be bi-submersions. A smooth map f:U1  →  U2 is a morphism of bi-submersions if [formula] and [formula].

In order to compare bi-submersions, we used the notion of bisections:

A bisection of (U,t,s) is a locally closed submanifold V of U such that s and t restricted to V are diffeomorphisms to open subsets of M. We say that V is an identity bisection if moreover the restrictions of s and t to V coincide.

We say that u∈U carries the foliation-preserving local diffeomorphism φ if there exists a bisection V such that u∈V and [formula].

In [\cite=AndrSk] it is shown that if (Uj,tj,sj) are bi-submersions, j  =  1,2 then a u1∈U1 carries the same diffeomorphism with u2∈U2 iff there exists a morphism of bi-submersions g defined in an open neighborhood of u1∈U1 such that g(u1)  =  u2.

Actually the proof given in [\cite=AndrSk] proves a stronger statement which will be useful here:

Let (Uj,tj,sj) be bi-submersions, j  =  1,2, Vi  ⊂  Ui identity bisections and uj∈Vj such that s1(u1) = s2(u2). Then there exists a morphism of bi-submersions g defined in an open neighborhood U'1 of u1∈U1 such that g(u1)  =  u2 and [formula]. [formula]

Minimal bi-submersions

If (U,t,s) is a bi-submersion and u∈U, then the dimension of the manifold U is at least dim M +  dim Fs(u). We say that (U,t,s) is minimal at u if dim U =  dim M +  dim Fs(u).

If f:(U',t',s')  →  (U,t,s) is a morphism of bi-submersions and U is minimal at f(u'), then dfu' is onto. Therefore, there is a neighborhood W' of u' in U' such that the restriction of f to W' is a submersion.

For every bi-submersion (U,t,s) and every u∈U, there exists a bi-submersion (U',t',s'), and u'∈U' such that U' is minimal at u' and carries at u' the same diffeomorphisms as U at u. It follows that there is a neighborhood W of u in U and a submersion which is a morphism f:(W,t|W,s|W)  →  (U',t',s').

The following result will be used in the sequel:

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V an identity bisection. Let u∈V and assume U is minimal at u. Then there is a neighborhood U' of u in U and a submersion [formula] which is a morphism of bi-submersions which is strictly transverse to [formula] and to [formula].

The composition [formula] carries at (u,u) the identity bisection [formula]. It follows that there exists a neighborhood of (u,u) in [formula] thet we may assume of the form [formula] and a morphism [formula]. By minimality of U at u, we may assume that p is a submersion. Moreover [formula] and [formula] are bi-submersions. Again, by minimality of U at u, it follows that, up to restricting U', the restrictions of p to [formula] and [formula] are submersions, hence p is transverse to [formula] and to [formula] - strictly by equality of dimensions.

Atlas of bi-submersions

Let [formula] be a family of bi-submersions. A bi-submersion (U,t,s) is adapted to U if for all u∈U there exists an open subset U'  ⊂  U containing u, an i∈I, and a morphism of bi-submersions U'  →  Ui.

We say that U is an atlas if

[formula].

The inverse of every element in U is adapted to U.

The composition [formula] of any two elements in U is adapted to U.

An atlas V  =  {(Vj,tj,sj)}j∈J is adapted to U if every element of V is adapted to U. We say U and V are equivalent if they are adapted to each other. There is a minimal atlas which is adapted to any other atlas: this is the atlas generated by "identity bi-submersions".

The groupoid of an atlas

The groupoid of an atlas [formula] is the quotient of [formula] by the equivalence relation for which u∈Ui is equivalent to u'∈Uj if Ui carries at u the same local diffeomorphisms as Uj at u'.

For every bi-submersion U adapted to U we have a well defined (quotient) map [formula].

The C*-algebra of a foliation

In [\cite=AndrSk] we associated to an atlas U a *  -algebra [formula]. Here Ω1 / 2 denotes the bundle of half densities on [formula] and I is the space spanned by the p!(f), where p:W  →  U is a submersion which is a morphism of bi-submersions and f∈Cc(W;Ω1 / 2W) is such that there exists a morphism q:W  →  V of bi-submersions which is a submersion and such that q!(f)  =  0.

To any bi-submersion V adapted to U we can associate a linear map QV:C∞c(V;Ω1 / 2V)  →  AU. Involution and convolution in AU are then defined by

[formula]

for (Vi,ti,si) bi-submersions adapted to U and fi∈C∞c(Vi;Ω1 / 2Vi), i  =  1,2.

The C*-algebra C*(U) of the atlas U is the (Hausdorff)-completion of AU with a natural C*-norm [\cite=AndrSk]. Actually, two natural completions were considered: the full and the reduced one.

If U is adapted to V, we have natural *  -morphisms A(U)  →  A(V) and C*(U)  →  C*(V).

When U is the mininal atlas we write C*(M,F) for the full and C*r(M,F) for the reduced completion.

The representations of the full C*-algebras were described in [\cite=AndrSk] in terms of representations of the associated groupoid. We will come back to this description below (§[\ref=repsPseudo]).

The cotangent space

The symbols should be functions on the total space of a "cotangent bundle". Let us discuss this space.

The cotangent bundle of the foliation F (although it is in general not a bundle) is the union [formula]. It is endowed with a natural projection p:F*  →  M ((x,ξ)  ↦  x). Also, for each X∈F, we have a natural map [formula]. We endow F* with the weakest topology for which the maps p and qX are continuous.

The space F* is locally compact.

It is enough to show that p- 1(U) is locally compact for every small enough open set U of M. We may therefore assume that F is finitely generated i.e. it is a quotient of [formula]. Then F* consists of elements of [formula] such that the map [formula] factors through the quotient F of [formula] (i.e. vanishes on the kernel of the map [formula]). It is a closed subset of [formula] and is therefore locally compact.

Let F be the foliation on [formula] defined by the (infinitesimal) action of SO(3). It is easy to see that [formula].�

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V an identity bisection. Identifying the normal bundle NV with ker ds (or ker dt), there are epimorphisms dxt:NxV  →  Fx, x∈V (or dxs). Dualizing these maps we find that locally the cotangent bundle F* is a closed subspace of N*V. Thus we can restrict symbols to F*.

Let (U',t',s') and (U,t,s) be bi-submersions with identity bisections V' and V. Let p:U'  →  U is a smooth map that is a morphism of bi-submersions such that p(V')  ⊆  V. Then for every x∈s'(V') the inclusion F*x  →  (N'x)* factors as the composition of p*x:N*x  →  (N'x)* with the inclusion F*x  →  N*x.

The space of pseudodifferential kernels on a foliation

Pseudodifferential kernels on a bi-submersion

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion. The bundle (over U) of half densities on [formula] will be simply denoted by Ω1 / 2.

We define Pm(U,V;Ω1 / 2) (resp. Pmc(U,V;Ω1 / 2)) to be the space of generalized sections of the bundle Ω1 / 2 with pseudodifferential singularities along V (resp. those with compact support) of order ≤  m. We drop the superscript m when we make no order requirements.

Let N be the normal bundle of the inclusion V  →  U. Note that N canonically identifies with both the restrictions to V of the bundles ker ds and ker dt. Under these identifications the bundle [formula] is trivial.

The principal symbol of P∈Pm(U,V;Ω1 / 2) is therefore an element of Sm(V,N*), i.e. a function on N* which is homogeneous of degree m.

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V an identity bisection.

Denote by U- 1 the inverse bi-submersion and κ:U  →  U- 1 the (identity) isomorphism. For an operator P∈Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2) define [formula].

Finally, let U,U' be bi-submersions, V  ⊂  U an identity bisection, P∈Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2) and f∈C∞c(U';Ω1 / 2). Using the first projection which is a submersion [formula] we may pull back P to a generalized function with pseudodifferential singularities on [formula]; multiplying it by f, we get [formula]. In the same way, we construct [formula].

Extending representations to pseudodifferential kernels

We fix an atlas U. Denote by [formula] the associated groupoid.

Quasi-invariant measures

Recall that a measure μ on M is said to be quasi-invariant by the atlas U if for every bi-submersion (U,t,s) adapted to the atlas U the measures [formula] and [formula] are equivalent (here λs and λt are Lebesgue measures along the fibers of s and t respectively).

In that case, there is a measurable almost everywhere invertible section ρU of [formula] such that for every [formula] we have

[formula]

If p:(U,t,s)  →  (U',t',s') is a morphism of bi-submersions, there is a canonical isomorphism of the bundles [formula] and [formula]. Under this isomorphism, the maps ρU and p*(ρU') coincide (almost everywhere). We interpret this by saying that ρ is defined on the groupoid [formula]. Furthermore, one may see that it is naturally a homomorphism.

The morphism ρ defined here takes also into account the Radon Nykodym derivative (DU)1 / 2 that we used in [\cite=AndrSk].

A function f on [formula] is just a function [formula] on [formula] which is constant on the equivalence classes. We will say that the function f is measurable with respect to the quasi-invariant measure μ if [formula] is measurable (with respect to the measures [formula]).

Let (W,t,s) and (Wi,ti,si) be bi-submersions, Y  ⊂  W a submanifold and pi:W  →  Wi be morphisms of bi-submersions which are submersions transverse to Y (here i∈{1,2}). Let μ be a quasi-invariant measure on M and β a measurable bounded function on [formula].

For Q∈Pc(W,Y;Ω1 / 2), we have

[formula]

Note that, by the transversality assumption, the pi!(Q) are smooth functions. This explains the meaning of this formula.

For Q∈C∞c(W;Ω1 / 2) these two expressions coincide (by Fubini) with

[formula]

The Lemma follows from § [\ref=density].

We will use an immediate generalization of this lemma:

Let (W,t,s) and (Wi,ti,si)i∈I be bi-submersions and Y  ⊂  W a closed submanifold. Assume that there is an open cover (Zi)i∈I of W and pi:Zi  →  Wi morphisms of bi-submersions which are submersions transverse to [formula]. Let (χi) be a smooth partition of the identity adapted to the cover Zi. Let μ be a quasi-invariant measure on M and β a measurable bounded function on [formula].

For Q∈Pc(W,Y;Ω1 / 2), the quantity

[formula]

does not depend on the choices of I and the family (Zi,χi,Wi,pi)i∈I with the above requirements. [formula]

Let (W,t,s) be a bi-submersion and Y  ⊂  W a submanifold. We say that Y is transverse to ζW if there is an open cover (Zi)i∈I of W and pi:Zi  →  Wi morphisms of bi-submersions which are submersions transverse to [formula]. The above Lemma makes sense of

[formula]

for Q∈Pc(W,Y;Ω1 / 2).

Extension of representations

We now fix an atlas U and a non degenerate *  -representation Π of C*(U) on a Hilbert space H.

Let us fix some notation:

Denote by [formula] the natural morphism from [formula] to its Hausdorff-completion. If U is a bi-submersion adapted to U, denote by θU:C∞c(U;Ω1 / 2)  →  C*(U) the composition [formula]. Finally, put [formula].

According to [\cite=AndrSk], there is a triple (μ,H,π) where:

μ is a quasi-invariant measure on M;

H = (Hx)x∈M is a measurable (with respect to μ) field of Hilbert spaces over M.

For every bi-submersion (U,t,s) adapted to U, πU is a measurable (with respect to [formula]) section of the field of unitaries πUu:Hs(u)  →  Hs(u).

Moreover:

π is 'defined on [formula]': if f:U  →  V is a morphism of bi-submersions, for almost all u∈U we have πUu  =  πVf(u).

π is a homomorphism: If U and V are bi-submersions adapted to U, we have [formula] for almost all [formula].

Then [formula] is the space of square integrable sections of H. For every bi-submersion (U,t,s) adapted to U, we have:

[formula]

μ-a.e. for every ξ∈H and x∈M.

It follows that [formula].

Let (W,t,s) be a bi-submersion and Y  ⊂  W a submanifold transverse to ζW. There is a linear map ΠW,Y:Pc(W,Y;Ω1 / 2)  →  L(H) such that for every open subset Z  ⊂  W, every morphism p:Z  →  U of bi-submersions which is a submersion transverse to [formula] and every [formula] we have ΠW,Y(Q) = ΠU(p!(Q)).

Let [formula] be bounded square integrable sections, and define a bounded measurable function β on [formula] by putting [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma3.5] that, for Q∈Pc(W,Y;Ω1 / 2), using any partition of unit adapted to a nice cover of W to construct ΠW,Y(Q) we have

[formula]

which is well defined by Lemma [\ref=lemma3.5]. The conclusion follows by density of bounded sections in H.

Taking Π to be faithful, we find:

Let (W,t,s) be a bi-submersion and Y  ⊂  W a submanifold transverse to ζW. There is a linear map θW,Y:Pc(W,Y;Ω1 / 2)  →  θ(A(U)) such that for every open subset Z  ⊂  W, every morphism p:Z  →  U of bi-submersions which is a submersion transverse to [formula] and every [formula] we have θW,Y(Q) = θU(p!(Q)). [formula]

Pseudodifferential kernels and multipliers

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V  ⊂  U an identity bisection. Let U' and U'' be bi-submersions. For P∈Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2), f∈C∞c(U';Ω1 / 2) and g∈C∞c(U'';Ω1 / 2), we defined [formula] and [formula] (see Definition [\ref=defi3.1]).

Note that [formula] and [formula] are bi-submersions and therefore transverse to [formula] and [formula] respectively.

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V  ⊂  U an identity bisection. Let U' and U'' be bi-submersions. For P∈Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2), f∈C∞c(U';Ω1 / 2) and g∈C∞c(U'';Ω1 / 2) we have [formula]. In other words, there is a multiplier U,V(P) of θ(A(U)) such that

[formula]

It is enough to prove this theorem for P,f,g with small enough support so that we may assume that there exist morphisms of bi-submersions [formula] and [formula] which are submersions respectively transverse to [formula] and [formula]. Then the morphisms [formula] and [formula] are morphisms of bi-submersions and are submersions respectively transverse to [formula].

We have [formula] by Corollary [\ref=cor3.7]. In the same way [formula]

Note that U,V(P) is a closable multiplier, since its adjoint contains U- 1,V(P*) and is therefore densely defined.

Let p:U'  →  U be a submersion and a morphism of bi-submersions such that p(V')  ⊂  V. Recall from prop. [\ref=push-forward] that there is a natural map p!:P(U',V';Ω1 / 2)  →  P(U,V;Ω1 / 2) obtained by integration along fibers.

With the above notation, we have [formula]. [formula]

The space of pseudodifferential multipliers

We have fixed an atlas U = (Ui,ti,si)i∈I together with identity bisections Vi  ⊂  Ui such that [formula] ().

Denote by [formula] the disjoint union [formula] and by [formula] the disjoint union [formula].

Let [formula]. We form a space [formula]. This is the image in the multiplier algebra of θ(A(U)) of [formula].

We define the space of pseudodifferential multipliers to be the union Ψ∞c(U,V) of [formula].

An element in [formula] is called regularizing.

Let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion adapted to U and V an identity bisection in U. We just constructed a linear map U,V:Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2)  →  Ψ∞c(U,V).

Elements of A(U) give obviously rise to regularizing operators. On the other hand, a regularizing operator is for every k the image of a function [formula]; as the map θ is not injective, it is not clear whether fk can be taken constant (i.e. in A(U)).

The longitudinal principal symbol

The longitudinal principal symbol of an element of [formula] is a homogeneous function on the space [formula] of non zero elements in F*.

To construct it, we may assume that si:Vi  →  M are injective. Identify Vi with its image in M. Let Pi∈P(Ui,Vi;Ω1 / 2) of order m. The principal symbol σ̃m(Pi) is defined to be the restriction to the subspace [formula] of [formula] of the principal symbol of Pi. Extending it by linearity, we define the longitudinal principal symbol of any element of [formula].

It is not obvious whether the longitudinal principal symbol is defined in the image [formula]. This happens if the groupoid [formula] is longitudinally smooth. In that case, one may define σ̃m(P)(x,ξ) using the regular representation on [formula] and a formula as in Proposition [\ref=exactsequence]: σ̃m(x,ξ) =  lim n  →    +    ∞〈einφχn,(in)- mP(einφχ)(x) where [formula] with derivative ξ at x and χn is a suitable function which has L2 norm 1 and has support around x - it is of the form [formula] where [formula].

Even when this longitudinal principal symbol is well defined though, it is not clear whether there is an exact sequence as in Proposition [\ref=exactsequence], since an element in P∈Pmc(U,V;Ω1 / 2) whose longitudinal principal symbol vanishes on F*  ⊂  N* may not be in Pm - 1c(U,V;Ω1 / 2). Namely, it is not clear to us whether there exists Q∈Pm - 1c(U,V;Ω1 / 2) which has the same image in Ψ∞c(U,V) as P. Here is an example of this situation: Consider the foliation defined by the the action of SO(3) in [formula] (example [\ref=ex:SO3]) and take the order 0 symbol [formula] outside F* and zero in F*. This is a symbol of order 0 which vanishes on F*, but there is no pseudodifferential operator of order - 1 whose symbol is a in a neighborhood of F*.

If we change atlases, the pseudodifferential operators don't really change. Indeed, let (U,t,s) be a bi-submersion and V an identity bisection. Let U be any atlas (e.g. the minimal one). Then, since U carries the identity bisection, there is a neighborhood U' of V in U such that (U',t,s) is adapted to U. Thus, there is an open cover (U'i) of U' and morphisms [formula] such that [formula] (cf. prop. [\ref=identbisect]). Every element of Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2) can be written as P + h with P∈Pc(U',V;Ω1 / 2) and h∈C∞c(U,Ω1 / 2).

We deduce:

If we change the identity bisections we don't change at all the space Ψ∞c(U,V).

Let U and U' be atlases such that U is adapted to U'. We have a natural morphism j:C*(U)  →  C*(U'). If j is injective, then we have an equality P(U',V') = P(U,V) + θ(A(U')).

Convolution: the algebra of pseudodifferential kernels

Let U,W be bi-submersions adapted to U, V  ⊂  U an identity bisection and [formula] a morphism of bi-submersions which is a submersion strictly transverse to [formula] and to [formula]. Then, for Q1,Q2∈Pc(U,V;Ω1 / 2) we have [formula].

Note that by proposition [\ref=products], [formula] makes sense as a distribution and [formula] is pseudodifferntial.

Let U' be another bi-submersion and f∈C∞c(U';Ω1 / 2). We have to show that [formula]. To that end, we may take a faithful representation Π and compute [formula] and [formula]. These two expressions are equal when Q1 and Q2 are smooth functions. The general case follows using § [\ref=density].

The space Ψ∞c(U,V) is a subalgebra of the multiplier algebra of θ(A(U)). More precisely, given [formula] (i = 1,2, there is [formula] such that (P1)(P2) = (P) and σ̃m1(P1)σ̃m2(P2) = σ̃m(P).

By prop. [\ref=transverse], there is a cover of M by (open) sets s(V'i) where V'i is an identity bisection of a bi-submersion U'i adapted to U for which there is a morphism of bi-submersions [formula] which is a submersion strictly transverse to [formula] and to [formula].

There is a finite open cover (U''j) of the [formula] such that, putting [formula], if [formula], then there are morphisms of bi-submersions from U''j and from U''k to the same U'i which are submersions.

Using a partition of the identity adapted to U''j, we are reduced to the case where P1∈Pm1c(U''j,V''j;Ω1 / 2) and P2∈Pm2c(U''k,V''k;Ω1 / 2).

If [formula] then [formula] with [formula], and therefore [formula].

If [formula], we may replace P1 and P2 by their images Q1,Q2 in Pc(U'i,V'i;Ω1 / 2) (prop. [\ref=imagepseudo]). Now, by proposition [\ref=products], [formula] makes sense as a distribution and [formula] is pseudodifferntial and has the right longitudinal principal symbol. The result follows by Lemma [\ref=lemma3.15].

Longitudinal ellipticity

In this section we assume that the manifold M is compact.

A pseudodifferential operator P∈Pmc(U,V) is said to be longitudinally elliptic if its longitudinal principal symbol σ̃m(P) is invertible.

Parametrix

We now state the analogues in our setting of some most important classical results in the pseudodifferental calculus.

Let [formula] be a longitudinally elliptic operator of order m. There is a pseudodifferential operator [formula] of order - m such that 1 - (P)(Q) and 1 - (Q)(P) are regularizing.

The main ingredient of the proof is:

Let [formula] be longitudinally elliptic and [formula]. Then there exists [formula] such that [formula].

which, in turn, relies on the following result:

Let [formula] be longitudinally elliptic. Then there exists the following data:

a finite set I, bi-submersions (U'i,t'i,s'i)i∈I and identity bisections V'i  ⊂  Ui' and morphisms of bi-submersions [formula] that are submersions strictly transverse to [formula] and to [formula];

open relatively compact subsets Ui  ⊂  U'i such that [formula] is relatively compact in V'i;

[formula];

operators P'i∈Pmc(U'i,V'i;Ω1 / 2) whose (plain) principal symbol σm(P'i) is invertible on [formula];

smooth functions φi∈C∞c(U'i) such that φi|Vi  =  1

so that φiP - P'i is regularizing.

Let x∈M; consider a pair (U',V') such that (U',t',s') is a bi-submersion, V' is an identity bisection, which is minimal at a point v∈V' with s(v) = x . Take φ∈C∞c(M) to be 1 in a neighborhood of x with support in s(V'). There exists an operator P'∈P(U',V') of order m, such that φP  -  P' is regularizing. Whence σm(P)φ  =  σm(P')|F* and σm(P')(v,ξ) is invertible for every ξ∈N*v since (U',V') is minimal at v. The set of w∈V' for which σm(P')(w,ξ) is invertible for all ξ∈N*w is open (by compactness of the spheres). It follows that σm(P')(w,ξ) is invertible for every w in a small enough neighborhood of u in V' and ξ∈N*w.

The result follows by compactness of M (using prop. [\ref=transverse]).

Here are the proofs of the previous two results:

Consider the data (Ui,Vi),(U'i,V'i) and P'i of [\ref=localization] associated to P. Let (χi)i∈I be a partition of unity associated to the cover (Vi)i∈I.

Since the (plain) symbol of P'i is invertible over [formula], there exist Ti∈P(U'i,V'i;Ω1 / 2) of order - m whose (plain) principal symbol is σm(P'i)- 1 in a neighborhood of [formula]. Then P'iTiχi  -  χ∈P- 1c(U'i,V'i;Ω1 / 2) (we use pi! to make this composition).

There is an operator Ri∈Pkc(Ui,Vi;Ω1 / 2) whose image in Ψ∞c(U,V) is χiS up to regularizing operators. Put then [formula].

Lemma [\ref=parametrix:main] allows us to follow the classical proof: First construct [formula] such that I - Q0P is of negative order. By putting Qk  =  Q0(I  -  PQ0)k = (I  -  Q0P)kQ0 we obtain a sequence of operators of order - m - k, [formula]. From [\ref=smoothing] it follows that there exists Q of order - m (asymptotically the sum of the Qk) such that I - PQ and I - QP are regularizing.

Square roots

If [formula] is self-adjoint of even order and σ̃2m(P) > 0, there is a self-adjoint [formula] selfadjoint such that P - Q2 is smoothing.

We use lemma [\ref=localization] and the notation there. Coming back to its proof, we may assume that the (plain) symbol of P'i restricted to Vi is > 0. Let then Q'i∈P- 1c(U'm,V'i;Ω1 / 2) that we may assume self-adjoint, such that the restriction to Vi of its plain principal symbol is [formula]. Let χ2i be a partition of the identity adapted to Vi, and put [formula]. Then P - Q20 is of order 2m - 1. Note that Q0 is elliptic

Suppose we constructed [formula] self-adjoint, such that Qj has order m - j and [formula] is self adjoint of order 2m - n. Thanks to lemma [\ref=parametrix:main], we find Qn of order m - n such that 2Q0Qn - Rn has order m - n - 1. It is a consequence of prop. [\ref=products] that Q0 and Qn commute up to lower order, therefore 2QnQ0 - Rn has order m - n - 1. Since Q0 and Rn are selfajoint, we may replace Qn by 1 / 2(Qn + Q*n). Hence Qn is a sequence that satisfies [\ref=smoothing]. Put Q' the asymptotic sum of the Qjs and [formula]. This is self-adjoint and also an asymptotic sum for Qn. By construction, P - Q2 is smoothing.

The extension of zero order pseudodifferential operators

Let us begin by a remark that will allow us to assume that the manifold M is compact.

Let M' be an open subset of M. Then C∞c(M')F is a foliation F' on M'. A bi-submersion (U,t,s) for (M,F) restricts to a bi-submersion of (M',F') by putting U' = {u∈U; s(u)∈M', t(u)∈M'}. In this way, an atlas U of (M,F) restricts to an atlas of U' of (M',F'). By extending compactly supported functions on U', we embed C*(U') into C*(U).

Assume M' is relatively compact in M. Then there exists f∈C∞c(M) which is everywhere nonzero on M'. Note that {fX; X∈F} is a foliation on M which has the same restriction to M' as M. There is a compact manifold M'' which contains an open subset diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of the support of f. Then M'' carries a foliation which has the same restriction to M' as F.

Every sufficiently negative order pseudodifferential operator defines an element in C*(U). More precisely, given a bi-submersion (U,t,s) and an identity bisection V  ⊂  U, let P∈P- mc(U,V;Ω1 / 2) with m strictly bigger than the dimension of the fibers of s and t, then (P)∈C*(U).

A continuous function with compact support in U defines an element in C*(U) (thanks to the L1 estimate and by density of C∞c(U)). Now, if a is of sufficiently negative order, the integral

[formula]

makes sense and thus the distribution P is actually a continuous function with compact support in U.

Negative order pseudodifferetial operators are in C*(U), as well as those zero order operators whose principal symbol vanishes on F*.

Zero order pseudodifferential operators define bounded multipliers of the C*-algebra of the foliation.

Using remark [\ref=Mbecomescompact], we may assume M is compact. By [\ref=self-adjoint], if [formula], there is Q∈Ψ∞c(U,V) such that P*P + Q*Q = t2 + R where R is of negative enough order, so that it belongs to the C*-algebra of the foliation (in fact it can even be taken smoothing). We have (Pf)*(Pf) + (Qf)*(Qf) = t2  f*f + f*Rf for all f∈A(U).

It follows that:

[formula], where [formula], hence P extends to a bounded multiplier and (b) follows.

if σ0P = 0, then in the quotient C*-algebra [formula], the norm of P is ≤  t for all t > 0, whence P∈C*(U).

We thus have an exact sequence of C*-algebras

[formula]

where Ψ*(M,F) denotes the closure of the algebra of zero order pseudodifferential operators with respect to multiplier norm and order 0 symbol. The algebra B is a quotient of the algebra C0(S*F) of continuous functions on the cosphere "bundle". As discussed in remark [\ref=remarksymbol], if the groupoid [formula] is longitudinally smooth, then B = C0(S*F).

Longitudinally elliptic operators of positive order

In this section we assume that M is compact.

Longitudinally elliptic operators and regular multipliers

Recall [\cite=Baaj] [\cite=BaajJulg] [\cite=Woronowicz] that an unbounded multiplier T of a C*-algebra is said to be regular if it is densely defined, its adjoint is densely defined and its graph is orthocomplemented, which means that [formula], where G = {(x,Tx); x∈dom  T} is the graph of T and [formula] its orthogonal complement for the obvious A valued scalar product in [formula].

Let Π be a non degenerates representation of A. It extends to a representation [formula] of the multiplier algebra M(A). Every regular unbounded multiplier T of A gives rise to a closed operator Π̂(T) whose graph is the closure of {(Π(a)ξ,Π(Ta)ξ); a∈dom  T; ξ∈HΠ}. The adjoint of Π̂(T) is Π̂(T*). In particular, if T is self adjoint, so is Π̂(T).

In [\cite=Vassout] Vassout proved that elliptic pseudodifferential operators (of positive order) on a Lie groupoid G give rise to regular operators. The proof in [\cite=Vassout] can be adapted to our setting to show:

If [formula] is the image of a longitudinally elliptic operator of order m, then [formula] is a regular multiplier on C*(U) (m > 0).

For every [formula], denote by [formula] its closure which is a multiplier of C*(U).

Let Q be a parametrix of P and write I - QP = R. Let [formula] be the (adjointable) operator of the C*-module [formula] with matrix [formula]

The restriction to [formula] of T2 has matrix [formula], whence T2 = T (as R + QP = I) .

Since T is an (adjointable) idempotent element in [formula], its range is orthocomplemented.

Since T is continuous, and [formula] is dense in [formula], we deduce that the range of T is the closure of [formula]

If (x,y)∈θ(A(U)), we find T(x,y) = (Rx + Qy,P(Rx + Qy)). If furthermore y = Px, T(x,y) = (x,y). It follows that [formula] is the graph of P.

We just proved that the closure of the graph of P is orthocomplemented, i.e. [formula] is regular.

In the same way we may adapt the proofs of [\cite=Vassout] to our setting to prove:

Any two longitudinally elliptic operators P,P'∈Ψ∞c(U,V) of the same order have the same domain.

Longitudinally elliptic operators define a filtration of C*(U) by Sobolev modules. If P is of order k  >  0 then

Hk(P)  =  dom  P with scalar product 〈α,β〉k  =  〈Pα,Pβ〉  +  〈α,β〉

H- k(P) is the completion of C*(U) with the norm [formula].

This filtration satisfies the following properties:

If k  >  k' then the identity on AU extends to a compact morphism of Hilbert modules [formula].

Any P∈Ψ∞c(U,V) of order m defines an element of L(Hk;Hk - m) for any k.

Using the Sobolev spaces above one can define an algebra Ψ-    ∞(U) of smoothing pseudodifferential operators without compact support by calling an operator R smoothing iff [formula]. It follows that AU  ⊂  Ψ-    ∞(U) is a dense subalgebra.

Application: Laplacian of a singular foliation

As a particular case we may construct a laplacian operator for every foliation and prove that it is a positive self-adjoint operator of L2(M).

Let (M,F) be a foliation. Every vector field X∈F defines a differential hence pseudodifferential operator X∈Ψ∞c(U,V) (cf. example [\ref=vectorfields]).

Since M is compact, F is generated by finitely many vector fields [formula].

The element [formula] is called a Laplacian of the foliation F.

From the definition of Δ we have:

A Laplacian Δ is a formally self adjoint elliptic operator of order 2; it therefore defines a regular (unbounded) self adjoint multiplier of C*(U).[formula]

We may apply that to the natural representation of C*(U) on L2(M) (which can be seen as the integration of the trivial representation [formula] of the groupoid in the sense of [\cite=AndrSk] where λ is the Lebesgue measure on M).

The Laplacian Δ defines an unbounded, self-adjoint operator Δ of L2(M). In other words, take vector fields [formula] on a compact manifold. Assume that the module they generate is a foliation, i.e. for every (i,j) there exist fi,j,k∈C∞(M) such that [formula]. Then the closure in L2(M) of [formula] is self adjoint.

One can apply theorem [\ref=laplace] to other natural representations of C*(U). One may for instance take the representation on L2 of a leaf. There, the Laplacian is elliptic and the difficulty comes from the fact that the leaf may not be compact.

The spectrum of the image of every regular operator - and in particular of Δ - is the same if we take two weakly equivalent representations of C*(U). This should apply if we compare the representation in L2(M) and a representation in L2 of a dense leaf.
