On Hydrodynamic Motions in Dead Zones

Introduction

A long standing problem in star formation concerns the accretion of high-angular momentum material in disks around protostars. The rediscovery of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in an astrophysical context, along with the discovery of the favorable transport properties of the turbulence that results from it [\citep=HawleyGammieBalbus1995] led to the widespread belief that a solution to this puzzle had been found. However, the instability requires a critical coupling strength between field and fluid [\citep=BlaesBalbus1994] [\citep=Jin1996]. Noting the high densities and low temperatures likely at the midplanes of protoplanetary disks, [\citet=G96] developed a model including a weakly-coupled, MRI-stable "dead zone" at the midplane of such disks. Since this prediction, considerable effort has gone into elucidating the conditions under which such a model might exist. Most of this work has centered on chemical studies of the conditions under which such a dead zone might form and what its radial and vertical extent might be. Recently, a number of numerical studies, pioneered by [\citet=FlemingStone2003], have begun to explore the dynamical consequences of the dead zone model [\citet=FromangPapaloizou2006]. [\citet=TurnerSanoDziourkevitch2007] have developed an interesting coupled chemical and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) model in which the dead zone disappears because of vertical mixing of ionized gas to the midplane. In their picture, the dead zone is absent in the sense that large scale magnetic fields with positive Maxwell stress, 〈 - BrBφ〉, form in the midplane and transport significant amounts of angular momentum even though the midplane is still MRI stable.

Aside from acting as a conduit for material flowing onto the protostar via accretion, protoplanetary disk midplanes are also the sites of planet formation. One of the outstanding issues in planet formation is the collection of micron-sized dust into planetesimals, rocky objects of order 1 in size. In this context, turbulent fluid motions more general than the correlated fluctuations that drive accretion become very important. This is because drag forces couple the dust and gas. Fully MRI-active simulations, [\citet=JohansenKlahr2005] find preferential concentration of dust in turbulent over-pressures. However, these same turbulent motions increase the velocity dispersion of the dust grains, possibly leading to destructive collisions. The dust-gas coupling can drive strong instability and clumping [\citep=YoudinJohansen2007] [\citep=JohansenYoudin2007], which, in combination with MRI turbulence, allows direct formation of planetesimals by gravitational instability [\citep=Johansen+etal2007]. Together, these results suggest that turbulence plays a complex role in planetesimal formation. As a first step to considering more complex dust-gas models including dead zones, it is critical to characterize the fluid motions in the MRI-stable midplane.

Here, we address two specific questions about the fluid motions in dead zones: do coherent, two-dimensional (2D) vortices form in dead zones? And, what are the wave-like motions seen in our previously published models of dead zone dynamics [\citep=OishiMacLowMenou2007]? Vortices have been studied both for their ability to drive purely hydrodynamic accretion [\citet=UmurhanRegev2004] and their ability to trap dust particles and thus act as sites of enhanced planetesimal formation [\citep=Bracco+etal1999] [\citep=Johansen+etal2004]. [\citet=JG05b] studied vortex dynamics in a 2D, compressible, shearing sheet model and concluded that random vorticity perturbations do form coherent large-scale vortices, but that energy in such structures decays away as t- 0.5. They also suggested that turbulent overshoot from the active layers might provide a vorticity source at the midplane. Using three-dimensional (3D), compressible but unstratified simulations, [\citet=Shen+etal2006] showed that small amplitude vortices are unstable to elliptical instabilities [\citep=Kerswell2002] and that finite-amplitude trailing waves are torn apart by a Kelvin-Helmholtz like instability before they have a chance to form coherent vortices. The anelastic simulations of [\citet=BarrancoMarcus2005] show large, coherent vortices forming at 1-3 H from the midplane, where H is the disk scale height. This unusual and quite unexpected result suggests that stratification plays an important role in disk vortex dynamics. Because our time-steps are Courant-limited by the Alfvén velocity, we restrict our domain to |z|  <  2H to avoid low-density regions with extremely high Alfvén speeds. Nonetheless, we study the effect of stratification on the flow inside and outside of the dead zone with the goal of understanding if MRI turbulence in active layers can sustain vortices.

In section [\ref=s:method] we briefly describe our numerical techniques and how we tested them, while section [\ref=s:results] contains the results of our 3D simulations, and section [\ref=s:vortex] reviews aspects of vortex dynamics and presents relevant 2D simulations. Finally, we discuss our results and present conclusions in section [\ref=s:discussion].

Numerical Method

Model Description

We use the Pencil Code [\citep=BrandenburgDobler2002] to solve the resistive MHD equations in the vertically stratified, shearing box limit [\citep=HawleyGammieBalbus1995].

All models are 3D, isothermal, non-ideal MHD, except for one ideal MHD control run, and one non-ideal, non-isothermal run (see section [\ref=s:ideal_gas]). They are run on a domain of 1H  ×  4H  ×  4H, where H is the disk scale height. The numerical method is stabilized with sixth-order hyperviscosity, hyperresistivity, and a hyperdiffusive operator on the density as described in [\citet=OishiMacLowMenou2007]. All the models are initialized with a MRI unstable zero-net flux initial magnetic field given by Bz(x)  =  B0sin(2πx / Lx) with initial plasma β  =  2μ0Pg / B20  =  400. The domain has periodic boundary conditions in y and z, and shearing periodic boundaries in x.

The non-ideal models use one of two z-dependent resistivity profiles. One is motivated by balancing cosmic ray-ionization to a critical depth in column density given by [\citet=FlemingStone2003]. These models were previously described in [\citet=OishiMacLowMenou2007] and are hereafter referred to as "FS runs". These models were run with cubical zones of size 32 and 64 zones per scale height. Unless otherwise noted, we use a resolution of 64 zones per scale height for the FS runs. The second profile, described below, uses hyperbolic tangent functions and models using it were run with 32 zones per scale height.

Hyperbolic Tangent Resistivity Profile

This alternate profile offers a sharper transition between active and dead zones than the FS profile, and allows the thickness of the dead zone to be controlled independently from its depth. Though simpler, it is less physically motivated than the FS profile. The profile is given by

[formula]

where η0 is the midplane resistivity, z0 is the transition height and Δz is the width of the transition region, set in this work to Δz  =  5dx, where grid zones have size dx. We set η0  =  1.67  ×  10- 5, corresponding to magnetic Reynolds number ReM  =  c2s / (ηmidΩ)  =  30 at z  <  |z0|. This gives all our tanh  models the same value of ReM in the dead zone as our fiducial FS run has at z  =  0.

The Maxwell stresses as a function of height for both sets of profiles are given in Figure [\ref=f:maxw_z_32]. The figure emphasizes the main utility of the tanh  profile: because the dead zone resistivity is independent of its size, we can study larger dead zones at a given resolution.

Tests

In the numerical study of non-axisymmetric perturbations in disks, a series of test problems are becoming standard. The vortical and non-vortical shearing waves have closed analytic solutions (in the former case, a WKB approximation) derived by [\citet=JG05a]. These waves have been used by JG05 to test a code derived from ZEUS [\citep=StoneNorman1992] and the higher-order Godunov code ATHENA [\citep=Shen+etal2006]. Aside from providing an analytic test solution for comparison, the incompressible wave is particularly useful for determining the amount of aliasing present in the numerical scheme. As a wave swings from leading to trailing, it wraps toward axisymmetry. However, in doing so the number of zones resolving the wave must drop. When the number of zones resolving each wavelength drops below some threshold, the code may unphysically transfer ("alias") power from the trailing wave into a new leading wave that will again swing amplify. This danger is highlighted by both [\citet=UmurhanRegev2004] and [\citet=Shen+etal2006], as such power may spuriously drive coherent vortices and angular momentum transport.

The Pencil Code uses spatially-centered finite differences and Runga-Kutta timestepping, meaning that its discretization lacks any formal algorithmic viscosity. Thus, it should perform well on this test. Ultimately, however, this property works against the code: without an explicit viscous term, it does not dissipate energy that moves to smaller scales, where an unphysical buildup occurs. In this sense, the shearing waves mimic the effect of a turbulent cascade: as time progresses, kx(t) decreases and the waves become less and less resolved. This is not a turbulent cascade of course, but the code is nonetheless forced to resolve smaller and smaller structures, leading eventually to a crash. To avoid this in these tests, as in our actual runs, we use a sixth-order hyperviscosity scaled by ν6 for stability, setting the hyperviscous Reynolds number at the grid scale Re6  =  udx5  /  ν6≃1, where u is the maximum velocity on the grid.

Figure [\ref=f:incomp_shwave_t_res] shows the incompressible shearing wave for runs with resolution N  =  64,128,256, demonstrating the ability of the Pencil code to accurately reproduce the analytic solution. The aliasing time in terms of the orbital frequency is [\citep=Shen+etal2006]

[formula]

where n is an integer, [formula] is the shear parameter, and ny  =  kyLy / 2π is the dimensionless azimuthal wavenumber of the wave. The oscillations around t = 20 appear to be small amplitude sound waves present in our compressible solution but not in the incompressible analytic solution.

In Figure [\ref=f:incomp_shwave_t_res], the N  =  64, 128, and 256 models run to tΩ0  =  100, where Ω0 is the local orbital frequency. This is well beyond the expected aliasing time taliasΩ0≃45.3n for Nx  =  128 and 90.6n for Nx  =  256. The figure makes an interesting point: aliasing does indeed occur for 642, but because the hyperviscosity is a strongly non-linear function of resolution, the spurious energy injected by aliasing becomes trivial before the first 1282 aliasing time. Even at 642, each successive aliased wave has less power, suggesting that sustained vortex activity is not likely to be powered by this numerical effect for long times. There is no aliasing at all at 1282 and 2562 resolutions, because the hyperviscosity damps the signal to machine precision before the first aliasing time. We have additionally performed a convergence test using resolutions of 64, 128, and 256. Using hyperviscosity, the average error over tΩ  <  10 reaches a constant value at 1282 and does not further converge. However, when we stabilize the algorithm using a physical Laplacian viscosity instead of hyperviscosity, [formula], the error converges at roughly ~  N- 1.6 where N is the resolution. We also consider the compressible shearing wave. Figure [\ref=f:comp_shwave_t_res] demonstrates the code's ability to resolve the wave with small error to late times with moderate resolution.

Finally, we successfully tested against the 3D, hydrodynamic, non-linear solution of the shearing box equations derived by [\citet=BalbusHawley2006]. Figure [\ref=f:bh_t_res] shows the kinetic energy of the wave as function of time. In this test, as in the others, the wavenumber drops, so that at larger times the error necessarily grows.

The incompressive shear wave test gives us a strict metric for aliasing: for the lowest resolution, we used H  =  64dx, and saw trivial amounts of aliasing. Doubling the resolution to H  =  128dx, we see no aliasing. Because the amount of vorticity increases in our MHD simulations when we increase the resolution from H  =  32dx to 64dx (see figure [\ref=f:en_adi_iso]), we are confident that any sustained vorticity in our MHD simulations does not come from numerical aliasing, and that the code accurately tracks any vortical motions present.

Results

The excitation and saturation of the MRI occur by t / torb  =  5 and the dead zone is clearly defined by orbit ~  10 (see section 3.3 for details). Here, we will restrict our analysis to times later than 25 orbits in order to avoid transients. Figure [\ref=f:M64_energy_alpha_vorticity] shows time series of vorticity ([formula]), and kinetic and magnetic energies. Although the saturated kinetic energy drops by over an order of magnitude between the ReM  =    ∞   and the ReM  =  3 models, the vorticity only drops by a factor of a few. This can be explained by the presence of residual vorticity in the dead zone.

Vorticity and Flow Dimensionality

The MRI produces significant amounts of vorticity, much of which is retained when a dead zone is introduced. Here, we investigate whether or not this vorticity can coalesce into coherent vortices that could be significant as a natural environment in which to trap dust and thus accelerate protoplanet formation.

In a thin accretion disk, the vertical gravitational acceleration is given by

[formula]

where Ω is the orbital frequency. In the local approximation, we take Ω0  =  Ω(R) where R is the assumed central radius of the shearing box. For an isothermal disk in hydrostatic equilibrium, the Brunt-Väisälä frequency of buoyant vertical oscillation is

[formula]

We can diagnose how stratified the flow is by comparing the vertical component of the vorticity ωz to the Brunt-Väisälä frequency N in a version of the internal Froude number, [\citep=BarrancoMarcus2005]

[formula]

N vanishes at the midplane, and thus Fr formally diverges as z  →  0. Nonetheless, Fr provides a useful diagnostic for the degree of stratification in the flow: when Fr  <  1, internal gravity waves rapidly homogenize vertical disturbances in the vortex, so the system is strongly stratified, and acts effectively as a 2D flow in which energy cascades to larger scales, similarly to the Earth's atmosphere. Thus, Fr is an effective measure of the dimensionality of a vortex in the disk plane.

Previous results show rapid vortex growth in purely 2D systems integrated over z [\citep=UmurhanRegev2004] [\citep=JG05b], and at Fr  <  1 in 3D stratified systems [\citep=BarrancoMarcus2005]. Figure [\ref=f:Fr_vs_z] shows the vertical behavior of Fr in our FS models. All but one of our simulations are purely isothermal, with P  =  c2sρ, so gravity waves themselves are excluded. However, because the basic dynamical properties of the MRI are not very sensitive to the equation of state [\citep=StoneHawleyGammieBalbus1996], we do not expect that including gravity waves will change the Fr profile. We confirm this expectation in figure [\ref=f:Fr_vs_z], which also includes our control ReM  =  30 run with a non-isothermal, γ = 5 / 3 ideal gas equation of state (see section [\ref=s:ideal_gas] for more details). The Fr profile is roughly similar to the run with isothermal ReM  =  30.

In our ideal MHD run the flow is effectively 3D through almost the entire domain--the MRI is a strong enough vorticity source to overwhelm the homogenizing effect of vertical oscillations almost everywhere. On the other hand, Figure [\ref=f:Fr_vs_z] suggests that the dead zone models have an effectively 2D flow at nearly all heights, most particularly in the dead zone of the ReM  =  3 model. Near the midplane, Fr diverges, as the stratification there goes to zero, so we would expect the very near midplane region to act as a 3D flow, consistent with the [\citet=BarrancoMarcus2005] results showing disappearance of their imposed vortices in that region.

However, Figure [\ref=f:img_vorticity_64_Re_3_geta] shows that no vortices form in either the dead or the active zone. In the dead zone, the vorticity remains confined to elongated, nearly axisymmetric bands. In fact, no difference is seen in ωz between heights within the dead zone-only between dead and active zones. Thus, our results combined with [\citet=Shen+etal2006] and [\citet=BarrancoMarcus2005], show that even in the presence of a vorticity source such as active zones, stratification is necessary but insufficient to produce vortices.

Table [\ref=t:enstrophy] shows the distribution of enstrophy among x,y, and z components for FS models and the ideal MRI run. A strongly two-dimensional flow shows a preferred direction [\citep=BNST95]. The ideal MRI run and the active zones of the FS models agree well with an isotropic distribution of vorticity. The dead zones show a strong preference for the y direction, indicating a circulation in the x - z plane, as indeed images bear out (see below). The coherent anticyclonic vortices we set out to investigate would have shown a strong z component.

Figure [\ref=f:M64_ux2_uy2_uz2_act_dead] shows the components of velocity dispersion for each of the FS runs as a function of time, computed separately inside and outside of the dead zone. The z component of velocity dominates within the dead zone, while outside of it, it is a factor of a few smaller than the others. (Note that the oscillation in the dead zone velocities is real, but the plot was made with relatively crude time resolution, δt  =  0.5torb and some aliasing from higher frequency signals is certainly present.) The dead zone motion is clearly not dominated by horizontal flows.

Morphology and velocity vectors

Figure [\ref=f:img_64R_density_vel_xy] shows images of density overlaid with velocity vectors for the midplane (the x-y plane at z  =  0) and Figure [\ref=f:img_64R_density_vel_xz] the x-z plane at y  =  0 for each of the FS runs. In the dead zone midplanes (the right three panels), compressive waves dominate the velocity field: velocity vectors lie almost entirely orthogonal to the density striations in the x-y plane. However, in the x-z plane, inertial mode signatures appear: the velocity is dominated by the z component, traveling up and down in well defined vertical bands.

The dead zone shows ordered uz alternating between positive and negative values across the dead zone that become more pronounced as ReM decreases (Fig. [\ref=f:img_64R_density_vel_xz], right three panels). This suggests that the vertical oscillations are at θ  =  0, with energy transport from gravity waves purely vertical between the active zones and the midplane. This is in stark contrast to the fully MRI-active case. Near its midplane, there are no well-defined vertical oscillations, and the ReM  =  100 model does not show nearly as well-ordered motion as the larger dead zone models. This is perhaps not surprising given that the fastest growing MRI mode has a growth rate qMRI  ~  Ω0, which is greater than N until around a scale height.

Wave Modes

The MRI is not operating in the densest parts of the disk in our dead zone models, so we expect that the motions excited in this region will take the form of linear wave modes stochastically excited by the active zone turbulence. The following analysis is motivated by the low-frequency oscillation in the volume-averaged kinetic energy most clearly shown in the ReM  =  3 data between 60  <  t  <  100 in Figure [\ref=f:M64_energy_alpha_vorticity]. Fourier analysis of this kinetic energy time series for runs with a dead zone show a clear peak in frequency space that shifts slightly to lower frequency with increasing dead zone size, suggesting the presence of a large amplitude coherent oscillation in these runs.

In order to better understand these dead zone oscillations, we take temporal power spectra of the radial and vertical velocity components ux, and uz, and the density perturbation δρ  =  ρ(x,y,z)  -  ρ0(z). [\citet=Arras+etal2006] and [\citet=Brandenburg2005] used similar methods to diagnose global modes of oscillation in fully magnetorotationally turbulent disks. The former were able to isolate acoustic and inertial oscillations. However, the latter found no clear wave signatures for MRI turbulence, though they did recover acoustic and inertial modes for forced hydrodynamic turbulence in a shearing box.

Figure [\ref=f:yavg_t_spectra] shows spectra computed by taking an FFT of a time series of each variable averaged in the y-direction at every (x,z) point on the grid of our low resolution model. The resulting power spectra were then averaged to raise signal-to-noise. Azimuthal averaging allows us to eliminate much of the MRI power in the active zones [\citep=Arras+etal2006], though this may not be a significant source in some of our larger dead zone models. The dominant peak in all variables at ϖmax≃0.23Ω0 shifts only very slightly, to lower frequency, as the dead zone is made thicker by a factor of two in the tanh  runs. This suggests that the vertical thickness of the dead zone is not setting the oscillation frequency. We have also determined that this characteristic frequency is unaffected by the radial (x) extent of the box by running the ReM  =  30 model with Lx  =  2 and confirming that the oscillation frequency is unchanged.

Because the box is periodic, standing oscillations can be excited, with discrete frequencies. The lowest frequency acoustic mode is in the vertical direction and has a frequency ϖ≃cs2π / Lz  =  1.11Ω0, which is clearly larger than ϖmax. The isothermal equation of state used in these models precludes gravity waves (which would also have ϖ  <  Ω0), and so we tentatively identify them as an inertial oscillation. Furthermore, the small shift seen in the tanh runs as the dead zone thickness increases is actually to lower frequency, while a higher boundary would drive internal oscillations at a higher frequency (see Eq. [\ref=e:brunt]) .

Non-isothermal models and Buoyancy Forces

The low frequency of these oscillations is suggestive of a gravity mode. However, these runs are strictly isothermal, P  =  c2sρ with cs constant everywhere, precluding buoyant responses and thus gravity waves.

Recently, [\citet=BaiGoodman2009] noted that isothermal equations of state might spuriously enhance vertical mixing, as buoyant forces can inhibit vertical mixing. Likewise, the lack of buoyancy in our isothermal models may artificially enhance both the residual transport at the midplane and the coherent oscillations. In order to understand the effect of isothermality on these issues, we ran a single model at 32 zones per scale height including an ideal gas equation of state P  =  ρkT / μ and an entropy equation,

[formula]

where κ6 is a hyperdiffusivity of entropy, u0y  =   - 3 / 2Ωx is the Keplerian velocity profile, Ω is the rotation rate of the shearing box, and all other symbols have their usual meanings. The entropy equation includes resistive and shock heating but not heating from the hyperdiffusivities (these terms are small, and do not significantly contribute to the thermal balance). We chose a ratio of specific heats γ  =  5 / 3.

The boundary conditions on this run as on the others are periodic in all directions, which precludes the escape of heat. We choose this rather unrealistic setup to directly compare with our isothermal simulations, in order to demonstrate that our results are not due to the lack of buoyancy in the isothermal case. Because of the turbulent heating, the total energy in the box increases compared to the isothermal case. Although the turbulence is strongest in the surface layers, there is no temperature inversion in the vertical direction: the midplane remains hotter than the surface. The disk quasi-statically adjusts to new equilibrium density and pressure profiles as the energy increases. While these profiles are somewhat different from the standard Gaussian density profile expected for accretion disks with linear z-gravity profiles, Figure [\ref=f:en_adi_iso] shows that the main result of this difference is a factor ~  2 increase in magnetic energy, and a factor ~  1.8 increase in kinetic energy.

The overall morphology of the flow is roughly similar to the isothermal model, with a reduced amplitude of motion in the dead zone but a similar large-scale structure. The stress profile across the dead zone is narrower but deeper in the ideal gas run than the isothermal one because of the pressure confinement caused by turbulent heating in a periodic box absent cooling. We directly compare the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses for isothermal (labeled γ  =  1) and ideal gas (γ = 5 / 3) in Figure [\ref=f:stress_adi_iso]. We find that inclusion of the buoyant forces reduces the amplitude of the vertical motions and increases their characteristic frequency to ϖmax≃0.5Ω0, still well below the first acoustic mode, as shown in Figure [\ref=f:adi_iso_spectra]. However, the motions are not suppressed, even in this model in which turbulent heating is not at all balanced by cooling. A real disk in which cooling is allowed will fall between the limits of the isothermal model and this heating only model. Therefore, we argue that the dead zone motions represent a physical phenomenon even in the presence of buoyancy forces.

Midplane Vortex Dynamics

We see no vortices in our simulations. We must establish that this is a physical result, and not due to insufficient resolution. JG05 demonstrate that sufficient numerical resolution is necessary to sustain kinetic energy and angular momentum transport from vortices. In their 2D simulations, they find 128dx / H to be the critical value, raising the question of whether vortices can form in 2D at our resolutions (32dx / H or 64dx / H)? Furthermore, the typical radial size scale of a vortex in their simulations is roughly H, the entire width of our box. Can vortices form in such cramped quarters?

Two-Dimensional Vortex Dynamics

In order to clarify these issues, we ran four sets of 2D hydrodynamic simulations. First, we studied resolution. A comparison between Figure [\ref=f:incomp_shwave_t_res] and Figure 1 of JG05 shows that the sixth-order Pencil Code is significantly less diffusive than their second-order, Zeus-derived method, suggesting that we might be able to see sustained vortex activity at lower resolution. Therefore we ran a set of models using their domain with size Lx  =  Ly  =  4H at resolutions of (16,32,64)dx / H, all with Gaussian random velocity perturbations with the same initial perturbation amplitude, σ  =  0.8cs. Figure [\ref=f:JG_resolution] shows the kinetic energy and α-parameter, [formula] for 2D. This Figure demonstrates clear convergence in these integrated quantities at 32dx / H.

Next, we turn to the question of domain size. JG05 use a domain four times larger in radial extent than we do in our 3D simulations. Could this inhibit vortex formation in our MHD runs? To test this, we ran a set of 2D hydrodynamic models with the same domain as the midplane of our 3D simulations, Lx  =  1H and Ly  =  4H, again with resolutions of (16,32,64)dx / H, seeded with perturbations of magnitude σ  =  0.8cs. Figure [\ref=f:JG_OMM_morphology] shows that vortex morphology is largely similar in both domains at three times, though there are more vortices present in the square domain.

Figure [\ref=f:OMM_resolution] shows the resulting energy and α. Although the results are not as well converged as in the square domain, there is still evidence for vortex activity with lifetimes clearly greater than the MRI growth time τMRI  ~  Ω at a resolution of [formula].

What, then, is the reason we do not see vortex activity in the 3D dead zone simulations? We have argued that dimensionality is not the limiting factor, as regions with lower Froude number that are more effectively 2D do not show more vorticity. It also appears clear that the 2D vortex activity found in previous simulations can be reproduced on domains like ours at the resolutions we use in our MHD runs, so resolution and grid size are also not limiting. Rather, the discriminant appears simply to be the strength of perturbations required to trigger long-lived vortices. We ran a third set of 2D hydrodynamic simulations, this time at a fixed resolution of [formula], but with decreasing velocity perturbation magnitudes σ  =  0.8cs,0.5cs, and 0.1cs. Figure [\ref=f:OMM_intensity] shows that below σ  =  0.8, the kinetic energy and α drop precipitously after only a few orbits. (Note that we keep the domain size fixed at Lx  =  1H, Ly  =  4H, unlike in the tests of JG05, in which the domain size was scaled linearly with the strength of the velocity dispersion.) We conclude that compressible vortices require strong σ  =  0.8cs initial perturbations in order to survive for many orbits.

[\citet=UmurhanRegev2004] see perturbation energy sustained essentially indefinitely for Re  =    ∞   and decaying away only very slowly for Re  =  50000, but their model is incompressible. They show this approximation to be rigorously valid for the small length scales they consider. However, interestingly, they find that the perturbation energy saturates at roughly [formula], where Eshear is the energy in the shear. They define the turbulent intensity of an incompressible shear flow as

[formula]

with u the disturbance velocity and ush the shear velocity. We write ush  =  qΩx, integrate for the Keplerian case q  =   - 3 / 2, and use our definition of (thermal) scale height H  =  2cs  /  Ω to arrive at

[formula]

with 〈2〉0.5  =  rms the RMS Mach number. Using their saturation value, this gives rms  ~  0.06(Lx / H), or about 0.06 over a domain of H. This is an order of magnitude below the levels necessary to incite vortices on the larger scales that we simulate in which compression becomes important. If we assume that small scale, non-linear, transient growth instability scales with Reynolds number as found by [\citet=LesurLongaretti2005], not only is the incompressible, small-scale, transient growth irrelevant for angular momentum transport, its saturation level is so small that larger scale vortices in the compressible regime will not form at all.

Long-lived axisymmetric structures

Recently, [\citet=JohansenYoudinKlahr2009] reported the existence of long-lived axisymmetric zonal flows in MRI turbulence, provided the radial width of the box is larger than ~  1H. These structures result from an inverse cascade of magnetic energy to the largest scales present in the box. This energy drives a large scale Maxwell stress, which in concert with the Coriolis force enforces the zonal flow. The end result are long-lived (~  10s of orbits) pressure and density fluctuations. It is easy to imagine that these complex structures could have significant influence on motions in the dead zones, assuming there is sufficient magnetic energy to launch the zonal flows in the first place. Figure [\ref=f:maxw_z_32] implies that this criterion is unlikely to be met: even in the moderate sized dead zone models (e.g., ReM  =  30 and z0  =  1), the total Maxwell stress is many orders of magnitude lower than that in the MRI active zones. However, given that [\citet=JohansenYoudinKlahr2009] demonstrate that the zonal flows are subtle, stochastically driven, and non-linear, we find such a crude estimate to be unsatisfactory.

Therefore, we re-ran our ReM  =  30 FS model with a radially-enlarged domain, running from  - H  <  x  <  H. By averaging ρ over the entire y - z domain, including both active and dead zones, we recover the reported long-lived axisymmetric structures. Nevertheless, our results remain robust: there is no vortex formation, and figure [\ref=f:yavg_t_spectra_x2h] demonstrates that the midplane oscillations are quite similar between the larger domain and our fiducial case.

Discussion

We find a complete lack of coherent anticyclonic vortices in all of our stratified local simulations of dead zones, despite the presence of a vorticity source in the form of active zones. While our experiments do not tell us exactly what happens, it appears that even if the midplane were a pure 2D layer, large scale vortex formation would not occur because the amplitude of velocity perturbations driven in the dead zone by the active layers is well below that needed. Recent work by [\citet=LesurPapaloizou2009] suggests that vortices in 3D disks are always parametrically unstable, though the growth rates of such instabilities can be very slow. Even in the presence of an active vorticity source, though, we find no vortex formation.

Our simulations cover a smaller range of z than [\citet=BarrancoMarcus2005], and it is possible that the increased stratification present at higher z may change our results. To strengthen the results presented here, direct comparison with [\citet=BarrancoMarcus2005] including compressibility would be quite enlightening. Furthermore, almost all of our simulations use an isothermal relation for pressure and density. This forces density gradients and pressure gradients to coincide, eliminating the baroclinic term driving the vortex formation from breaking gravity waves in [\citet=BarrancoMarcus2005]. Relaxing this requirement in our simulations may aid vortex formation at higher scale heights though our one adiabatic model without cooling did not show vortex formation either.

However, we do find a large-scale, axisymmetric oscillation about the midplane in all dead zone models. This oscillation carries nearly all the kinetic energy of the dead zone. We are unable to associate it with a normal mode using a simple linear dispersion relation. A more detailed analysis including the effects of continuous stratification could shed considerable light on the situation. Regardless of such details, the low frequency (less than Ω0) suggests that the mode will not have much effect on dust sedimentation, which is typically dominated by random fluctuation with correlation times τcorr≃0.15torb, corresponding to frequencies ≃7Ω0 [\citep=FromangPapaloizou2006]. It could, in principle, cause a warp in the dust layer, which in turn could affect the gravitational stability [\citep=GoldreichWard1973] [\citep=Johansen+etal2007]. Such phenomena can only be examined with a combined treatment of dust, self-gravity, and a dead zone, which we defer to future work.

Finally, global dynamics may significantly alter vortex formation properties. A real protoplanetary disk is thin and quasi-2D for horizontal scales greater than the scale height. It is quite possible that robust, anticyclonic vortices may form within a disk, but our results suggest that a local mechanism is not responsible. The baroclinic instability [\citep=KlahrBodenheimer2003] [\citep=PetersenJulienStewart2007] [\citep=PetersenStewartJulien2007] remains a candidate for forming such large scale vortices.
