On a class of hypersurfaces in [formula] and [formula].

Introduction

The study of hypersurfaces of the product spaces [formula] and [formula] has attracted the attention of several geometers in the last years. Here [formula] and [formula] denote the sphere and hyperbolic space of dimension n, respectively. A natural class of such hypersurfaces consists of those which have flat normal bundle when regarded as submanifolds with codimension two of the underlying flat spaces [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and [formula] denote the Euclidean and Lorentzian spaces of dimension (n + 2), respectively. Surfaces in [formula] with this property have been recently classified in [\cite=dillen]. The class includes, in particular, all rotational hypersurfaces [\cite=veken] and all hypersurfaces with constant sectional curvature and dimension n  ≥  3 [\cite=manfio]. It also contains all constant angle hypersurfaces, that is, hypersurfaces with the property that its unit normal vector field makes a constant angle with the unit vector field spanning the second factor [formula]. Constant angle surfaces in [formula] and [formula] have been completely described in [\cite=vrancken] and [\cite=munteanu], respectively. A similar description was given in [\cite=nistor] of surfaces in [formula] whose unit normal vector field makes a constant angle with a fixed direction.

In order to state our results, let [formula] denote either [formula], [formula] or [formula], according as ε = 1, ε = 0 or ε =  - 1, respectively. Given a hypersurface [formula], let N be a unit normal vector field and let [formula] be a unit vector field tangent to the second factor. Then, a vector field T and a smooth function ν on Mn are defined by

[formula]

Our first theorem classifies hypersurfaces [formula] for which T is everywhere a principal direction. Trivial examples are products [formula], where Mn - 1 is a hypersurface of [formula], which correspond to the case in which the angle function ν vanishes identically. More interesting examples arise as follows. Let [formula] be a hypersurface and let [formula] be the family of its parallel hypersurfaces, that is,

[formula]

where N is a unit normal vector field to g,

[formula]

Define

[formula]

by

[formula]

for some smooth function [formula] with nowhere vanishing derivative.

The map f defines, at regular points, a hypersurface that has T as a principal direction. Conversely, any hypersurface [formula] with nowhere vanishing angle function that has T as a principal direction is locally given in this way.

Besides (open subsets of) slices [formula] and products [formula], the hypersurfaces in Theorem [\ref=thm:main] turn out to be precisely the ones that have flat normal bundle when regarded as submanifolds of [formula] (see Proposition [\ref=lem:Rperpzero] in Section 2). Here ε∈{ - 1,1} and [formula] stands for either Euclidean space [formula] or Lorentzian space [formula], according as ε = 1 or ε =  - 1, respectively.

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:main], we get the following complete description of all hypersurfaces [formula] with constant angle function, called constant angle hypersurfaces.

Let f be given by ([\ref=eq:constantangle]) with a(s) = As for some A  ≠  0. Then f is a constant angle hypersurface. Conversely, any constant angle hypersurface [formula] is either an open subset of a slice [formula] for some [formula], an open subset of a product [formula], where Mn - 1 is a hypersurface of [formula], or it is locally given in this way.

Our next result characterizes constant mean curvature hypersurfaces of [formula] within the class of those which have T as a principal direction.

Let [formula] be an isoparametric hypersurface, and let H(s) be the (constant) mean curvature of its parallel hypersurface gs. Given [formula], let [formula] be a solution of

[formula]

on an open interval [formula] such that gs is an immersion on Mn - 1 for every s∈I. Then f is a hypersurface with constant mean curvature H that has T as a principal direction. Conversely, any hypersurface [formula] with nowhere vanishing angle function and constant mean curvature H that has T as a principal direction is locally given in this way.

In the minimal case, the ODE ([\ref=eq:edo]) can be explicitly solved in terms of the mean curvature function H(s) of the isoparametric family:

Let [formula] be an isoparametric hypersurface, and let H(s) be the (constant) mean curvature of its parallel hypersurface gs. Let [formula] be an open interval such that gs is an immersion on Mn - 1 for every s∈I. Given [formula] with 0 < h0 < 1, define [formula] by

[formula]

Then [formula] given by ([\ref=eq:constantangle]) is a minimal hypersurface that has T as a principal direction. Conversely, any minimal hypersurface [formula] with nowhere vanishing angle function that has T as a principal direction is locally given in this way.

Preliminaries

Given a hypersurface [formula] with a unit normal vector field N, let A be the shape operator of f with respect to N and let [formula] be the Levi-Civita connection of Mn. Using that [formula] is parallel in [formula], we obtain by differentiating ([\ref=eq:ddt]) that

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all X∈TM.

Another fact that we will need in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is that the vector field T is a gradient vector field. Namely, it is the gradient of the height function [formula].

As a final observation in this short section, let ξ denote the outward pointing unit normal vector field to [formula] along f and let Aξ be the corresponding shape operator. Then, it is easily seen that

[formula]

This leads to the following characterization of flatness of the normal bundle of f when regarded as an isometric immersion into [formula], first proved in [\cite=dillen] for surfaces in [formula].

Let [formula], ε∈{ - 1,1}, be a hypersurface. Suppose that T does not vanish at x∈Mn. Then f has flat normal bundle at x as an isometric immersion into [formula] if and only if T is a principal direction of f at x.

Proof: By the Ricci equation, f has flat normal bundle (as an isometric immersion into [formula]) if and only if A commutes with Aξ. This is the case if and only if the eigenspaces of Aξ are invariant by A, which by ([\ref=eq:eigenvectorAxi]) is equivalent to T being an eigenvector of A. pt

The proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]: We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Therefore, a point [formula] is regular for f if and only if gs is regular at x, in which case Ns(x) is a unit normal vector to gs at x and

[formula]

is a unit normal vector to f at (x,s). Notice that [formula] for any X∈TMn - 1. We have

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the derivative in [formula]. Then

[formula]

which shows that ∂   /   ∂s is a principal direction of f. Moreover, using that

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

hence

[formula]

Therefore T is a principal direction of f.

We now prove the converse. Since T is a gradient vector field, the orthogonal distribution [formula] is integrable. Hence, there exists locally a diffeomorphism ψ:  Mn - 1  ×  I  →  Mn, where I is an open interval containing 0, such that ψ(x,  ·  ):  I  →  Mn are integral curves of T for any x∈Mn - 1 and ψ(  ·  ,s):  Mn - 1  →  Mn are leaves of [formula] for any s∈I. In particular, [formula] for any X∈TMn - 1. Set [formula]. Then

[formula]

for any X∈TMn - 1. Thus [formula] for some smooth function ρ on I.

We claim that [formula] is a pre-geodesic of [formula] for any x∈Mn - 1, where [formula] is the canonical projection, that is, the arclength reparametrization of [formula] is a geodesic of [formula]. In other words, [formula] is a pre-geodesic of [formula] for any integral curve γ of T.

First notice that, since T is a principal direction of f, it follows from ([\ref=eq:DerivadaNu]) that X(ν) = 0 for any [formula], hence also [formula] for any [formula], for [formula]. Then, the following general fact implies that γ is a pre-geodesic of Mn.

Let T be a gradient vector field on a Riemannian manifold Mn. Assume that [formula] is constant along [formula]. Then the integral curves of T are pre-geodesics of Mn.

Proof: Since T is a gradient vector field, we have

[formula]

for all X,Y∈TM. Therefore, for any [formula] we obtain that

[formula]

Now observe that the velocity vector of α is [formula], whose length is [formula]. Therefore, all we need to prove is that

[formula]

lies in the direction of the normal vector field ξ to [formula] along f. We have

[formula]

where [formula]. Now, since [formula] by Lemma [\ref=le:pregeodesic], we have using ([\ref=eq:NablaT]) and ([\ref=eq:eigenvectorAxi]) that

[formula]

Then, from ([\ref=eq:1]), ([\ref=eq:2]) and

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, we have [formula] and

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=eq:3]) and ([\ref=eq:4]) that

[formula]

which proves the claim.

Now, since [formula] and ν are constant along [formula], there exists a smooth function [formula] such that [formula] for all (x,s)∈Mn - 1  ×  I. Define [formula] by [formula], and let gs be the family of parallel hypersurfaces to g. Set [formula], [formula] and ψ̃(x,s) = ψ(x,φ- 1(s)) for (x,s)∈Mn - 1  ×  J, with s0∈I and J = φ(I). By the claim, we have that

[formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:constantangle]:   The direct statement follows from ([\ref=eq:anglefunction]). If ν = 1 or ν = 0, it is easily seen that f(Mn) is an open subset of a slice [formula], [formula], or an open subset of a product [formula], where Mn - 1 is a hypersurface of [formula], respectively. Otherwise, it follows from ([\ref=eq:DerivadaNu]) that the vector field T is a principal direction. By Theorem [\ref=thm:main], the hypersurface f is locally given by ([\ref=eq:constantangle]). Finally, since ν is given by ([\ref=eq:anglefunction]), the fact that it is constant implies that the function a(s) in ([\ref=eq:constantangle]) is linear (with nowhere vanishing derivative), hence we may assume that a(s) = As for some A  ≠  0. pt Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:cmc]: Let [formula] be given by ([\ref=eq:constantangle]). We have

[formula]

hence the shape operator Aη satisfies

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

hence the principal curvature in the ∂   /   ∂s- direction is a''(s) / b3(s). It follows that the (non normalized) mean curvature function of f is given by

[formula]

where Hs denotes the mean curvature function of gs. The conclusion now follows from the fact that Hs is constant on V (that is, it depends only on s) if and only if g is an isoparametric hypersurface of [formula] (see [\cite=cecil], Theorem 5.8, p. 272). pt Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:min]:   Let us prove the converse. By Theorem [\ref=thm:cmc], if [formula] is a minimal hypersurface with nowhere vanishing angle function that has T as a principal direction, then it is locally given by ([\ref=eq:constantangle]) for some solution [formula] of ([\ref=eq:edo]) with H = 0, that is,

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we may assume that a'(s) > 0 for all s∈I. Then

[formula]

hence

[formula]

It follows that 0 < h(s) < 1 for all s∈I and

[formula]

Had we assumed that a'(s) < 0 for all s∈I, we would have obtained the same expression for a, but with the minus sign in ([\ref=eq:a]). The conclusion follows by taking a0 = a(0) and h0 = h(0) = (a'(0))2 / (1  +  (a'(0))2). The direct statement is now clear. pt
