Steinberg representation of [formula]: Bessel models and integral representation of L-functions

Ameya Pitale

Introduction

It is known that the representation of the symplectic group obtained from a Siegel modular form is non-generic, which means that it does not have a Whittaker model. Consequently, one cannot use the techniques or results for generic representations in this case. In such a situation one introduces the notion of a generalized Whittaker model, now called the Bessel model. These Bessel models have been used to obtain integral representations of L-functions. It is known that an automorphic representation of [formula], where [formula] is the ring of adeles of a number field, obtained from a Siegel modular form always has some global Bessel model. For the purposes of local calculations it is often very important to know the precise criteria for existence of local Bessel models and explicit formulas. In this paper, we wish to investigate Bessel models for unramified, quadratic twists of the Steinberg representation π of [formula], where F is any non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero.

Let us first briefly explain what a Bessel model is. Detailed definitions will be given in Sect. [\ref=bessel-model-section]. Let F be a non-archimedean field of characteristic zero. Let U(F) be the unipotent radical of the Siegel parabolic subgroup of [formula] and θ be any non-degenerate character of U(F). The group GL2(F), embedded in the Levi subgroup of the Siegel parabolic subgroup, acts on U(F) by conjugation and hence, on characters of U(F). Let [formula]. Then T(F) is isomorphic to the units of a quadratic extension L of F. The group R(F)  =  T(F)U(F) is called the Bessel subgroup of [formula] (depending on θ). Let Λ be any character of T(F) and denote by [formula] the character obtained on R(F). Let (π,V) be any irreducible, admissible representation of [formula]. A linear functional [formula], satisfying [formula] for any r∈R(F),v∈V, is called a (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional for π. We say that π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model if π is isomorphic to a subspace of smooth functions [formula], such that [formula] for all [formula]. The existence of a non-trivial Bessel functional is equivalent to the existence of a Bessel model for a representation. If π has a non-trivial (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional β, then a vector v∈V such that β(v)  ≠  0 is called a test vector for β.

In [\cite=PT], the authors have obtained, for any irreducible, admissible representation π of [formula], the criteria to be satisfied by Λ for the existence of a (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional for π. Their method involves the use of theta lifts and distributions. The uniqueness of Bessel functionals has been obtained in [\cite=N-PS] for many cases, in particular for any π with a trivial central character. In [\cite=Su], a test vector is obtained when both the representation π and the character Λ are unramified. In [\cite=Sa], a test vector is obtained when [formula] is odd and inert in the quadratic field extension L corresponding to [formula], the representation π is an unramified, quadratic twist of the Steinberg representation and Λ has conductor [formula]. The explicit formulas of the test vector in the above two cases have been used in [\cite=Fu] and [\cite=Sa] to obtain an integral representation of the [formula] L-function where the [formula] representation is either unramified or Steinberg.

The main goal of this paper is to obtain explicit formulas for a test vector whenever a Bessel model for the unramified, quadratic twist of the Steinberg representation of [formula] exists. In addition to obtaining these formulas, we, in fact, obtain an independent proof of the criteria for existence and uniqueness for the Bessel models. We also give precise conditions on the character Λ so that the Iwahori spherical vector in π is a test vector in Theorem [\ref=existence-theorem]. The methods used here are very different from those in [\cite=N-PS] and [\cite=PT].

When the Iwahori spherical vector is a test vector, we use the explicit formula for the test vector to obtain an integral representation of the local L-function L(s,π  ×  τ) of the Steinberg representation π of [formula], twisted by any irreducible admissible representation τ of [formula]. This integral involves a function B in the Bessel model of π and a Whittaker function W# in a certain induced representation of [formula] related to τ. We wish to remark that in this paper, and other works ([\cite=Fu], [\cite=PS1], [\cite=PS2], [\cite=Sa]), the Bessel function B is always chosen to be a "distinguished" vector (spherical if π is unramified and Iwahori spherical if π is Steinberg) which has the additional property of being a test vector. With this choice of B we have a systematic way of choosing W# (see [\cite=PS2]) so that the integral is non-zero and gives an integral representation of the L-function. The work so far suggests that to obtain an integral representation for the L-function with a general irreducible, admissible representation π of [formula], we will have to choose B to be both a "distinguished" vector in the Bessel model of π and a test vector for the Bessel functional. This further highlights the importance of obtaining more information and explicit formulas for test vectors for Bessel models of [formula]. This is a topic of ongoing work.

The local computation mentioned above, together with the archimedean and p-adic calculations in [\cite=Fu] and [\cite=PS2], we obtain an integral representation of the global L-function L(s,π  ×  τ) of an irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representation π of [formula], obtained from a Siegel cuspidal newform with respect to the Borel congruence subgroup of square-free level, twisted by any irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representation τ of [formula]. When τ corresponds to an elliptic cusp form in Sl(N,χ), we obtain algebraicity results for special value of the twisted L-function in the spirit of Deligne's conjecture [\cite=De1].

The paper is organized as follows. The first half of the paper deals with the existence and uniqueness of Bessel models. In Sect. [\ref=pi-steinberg-setup], we give the basics regarding the non-archimedean setup, Steinberg representation and the Iwahori Hecke algebra. The Steinberg representation is characterized as the only representation with a unique Iwahori spherical vector. We define [formula] to be the space of smooth functions on [formula] which are right invariant under the Iwahori subgroup I and transform on the left according to [formula]. In Sect. [\ref=double-coset-decomp-section]-[\ref=criterion-for-dim-section], we obtain that [formula] (the uniqueness), the criterion for [formula] and the explicit formula for the unique (up to scalars) function B in [formula]. The methods used here are similar to those in [\cite=Sa]. In case Λ is a unitary character such that [formula], we use the function B to generate a Hecke module VB. We show that VB is irreducible and has a unique (up to a constant) vector which is Iwahori spherical, hence implying that VB is a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for the Steinberg representation. In case Λ is not unitary (this can only happen when L is split over F), we use the fact that the Steinberg representation, in the split case, is generic and actually show that any generic, irreducible, admissible representation of [formula] has a split Bessel model. We believe that this result is known to the experts but since it is not available in the literature we present the proof in details. This is done is Sect. [\ref=existence-section], in particular Theorem [\ref=existence-theorem]. Let us remark here that many of the results in Sect. [\ref=bessel-model-section] involve a lot of computations. In the interest of brevity and to avoid distraction from the main point, we have sometimes illustrated the calculations for one case and left the other cases to the reader. For all the detailed computations, we refer the reader to a longer version of this manuscript [\cite=P1] available on our homepage.

In the second half of the paper, we give the application of the explicit formula of the test vector. In Sect. [\ref=non-arch-int-rep-section], we obtain an integral representation of the L-function of the Steinberg representation twisted by any [formula] representation in Theorem [\ref=steinberg-int-rep-L-fn]. In Theorems [\ref=global-thm] and [\ref=special_values_thm], we obtain an integral representation for the global L-function and a special value result.

The author would like to thank Ralf Schmidt for all his help, in particular, for explaining how to obtain a Bessel model from a Whittaker model in the split case. The author would also like to thank Abhishek Saha for several fruitful discussions on this topic.

Steinberg representation of [formula]

Non-archimedean setup

Let F be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. Let [formula], [formula], ϖ, q be the ring of integers, prime ideal, uniformizer and cardinality of the residue class field [formula], respectively. Let us fix three elements a,b,c∈F such that d: = b2 - 4ac  ≠  0. Let

[formula]

In case [formula], we consider F diagonally embedded. If L is a field, we denote by x̄ the Galois conjugate of x∈L over F. If [formula], let [formula]. In any case we let N(x) = xx̄ and tr(x) = x + x̄. We shall make the following assumptions:

We set the Legendre symbol as follows,

[formula]

If L is a field, then let [formula] be its ring of integers. If [formula], then let [formula]. Let ϖL be the uniformizer of [formula] if L is a field and set ϖL  =  (ϖ,1) if L is not a field. Note that, if [formula], then [formula]. Let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

We fix the following ideal in [formula],

[formula]

Here, [formula] is the maximal ideal of [formula] when L is a field extension. Note that [formula] is prime only if [formula]. We have [formula] for all [formula]. Let us recall Lemma 3.1.1 of [\cite=PS1].

Let notations be as above.

The elements 1 and α constitute an integral basis of L / F.

There exists no [formula] such that [formula].

Steinberg representation

Let us define the symplectic group [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula]. The maximal compact subgroup is denoted by [formula]. We define the Iwahori subgroup as follows,

[formula]

Let Ω be an unramified, quadratic character of F×. Let π be the Steinberg representation of H(F), twisted by the character Ω. This representation is denoted by [formula]. Since we have assumed that Ω is quadratic, we see that π has trivial central character. The Steinberg representation has the property that it is the only representation of H(F) which has a unique (up to a constant) Iwahori fixed vector. The Iwahori Hecke algebra acts on the space of I-invariant vectors. We will next describe the Iwahori Hecke algebra.

Iwahori Hecke algebra

The Iwahori Hecke algebra [formula] of H(F) is the convolution algebra of left and right I-invariant functions on H(F). We refer the reader to Sect. 2.1 of [\cite=Sc] for details on the Iwahori Hecke algebra. Here, we state the two projection operators (projecting onto the Siegel and Klingen parabolic subgroups) and the Atkin Lehner involution. The unique (up to a constant) Iwahori fixed vector v0 in π is annihilated by the projection operators and is an eigenvector of the Atkin Lehner involution.

Existence and uniqueness of Bessel models for the Steinberg representation

Let us fix an additive character ψ of F, with conductor [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] be as in Sect. [\ref=pi-steinberg-setup], and set [formula]. Then ψ defines a character θ on [formula] by

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Set [formula] and F(ξ)  =  {x + yξ:x,y∈F}. Then, it can be checked that T(F)  =  F(ξ)× and is isomorphic to L×, with the isomorphism given by

[formula]

We consider T(F) as a subgroup of H(F) via

[formula]

Let R(F) = T(F)U(F). We call R(F) the Bessel subgroup of H(F) (with respect to the given data a,b,c). Let Λ be any character on L× that is trivial on F×. We will consider Λ as a character on T(F). We have θ(t- 1ut) = θ(u) for all u∈U(F) and t∈T(F). Hence the map tu  ↦  Λ(t)θ(u) defines a character of R(F). We denote this character by [formula].

As mentioned in the introduction, a linear functional [formula], satisfying [formula] for any r∈R(F),v∈V, is called a (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional for π. We say that π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model if π is isomorphic to a subspace of smooth functions [formula] satisfying

[formula]

The existence of a non-zero (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional for π is equivalent to the existence of a non-trivial (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π. If π has a non-zero (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional β, then the space {Bv:v∈π,Bv(h): = β(π(h)v)} gives a non-trivial (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π. Conversely, if π has a non-trivial (Λ,θ)-Bessel model {Bv:v∈π} then the linear functional β(v): = Bv(1) is a non-zero (Λ,θ)-Bessel functional for π. We say that v∈π is a test vector for a Bessel functional β if β(v)  ≠  0. Note that a vector v∈π is a test vector for β if and only if the corresponding function Bv in the Bessel model satisfies Bv(1)  ≠  0.

Define the space [formula] of smooth functions B on H(F) which are right I-invariant, satisfy ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition]) and the following conditions, for any h∈H(F), obtained from ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-abstract-1])-([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-abstract-2]),

[formula]

Our aim is to obtain the criteria for existence and uniqueness for (Λ,θ)-Bessel models for π. Let us state the steps we take to obtain this.

Since a function B in [formula] is right I-invariant and satisfies ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition]) we see that the values of B are completely determined by its values on double coset representatives [formula]. We obtain these representatives in Proposition [\ref=disjoint-double-cosets-prop].

In Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], we use the I-invariance of B and ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition])-([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) to obtain necessary conditions to be satisfied by the values of functions in [formula] on double coset representatives for [formula]. This gives us [formula] in Corollary [\ref=dim-B(lambda] [\ref=theta)^I-leq-1-corollary].

In Proposition [\ref=well-defined-proposition], we show that the function B with the given values at double coset representatives for [formula] (obtained in Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop]) is well-defined. We show that B satisfies ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]), ([\ref=atkin-lehner-steinberg]) and ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) for all values of h∈H(F) and obtain the criteria for [formula] in Theorem [\ref=B(lambda-theta)^I-dimension-theorem].

Suppose Λ is such that [formula]. If Λ is unitary then we use [formula] to generate a Hecke module VB. We define an inner product on VB and show in Proposition [\ref=irreducibility-of-VB] that VB is irreducible and provides a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π. If Λ is not unitary (this can happen only if L is a split extension of F), then we show that any irreducible, generic, admissible representation of H(F) has a split (Λ,θ)-Bessel model. Since π is generic in the split case, we obtain in Theorem [\ref=existence-theorem] the precise criteria for existence and uniqueness of a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π.

Double coset decomposition

From (3.4.2) of [\cite=Fu], we have the following disjoint double coset decomposition.

[formula]

where

[formula]

It follows from the Bruhat decomposition for [formula] that

[formula]

Let W  =  {1,s1,s2,s1s2,s2s1,s1s2s1,s2s1s2,s1s2s1s2} be the Weyl group of [formula] and set

[formula]

Note that W(1) is the set of representatives for [formula]. Observing that [formula] is contained in R(F), we get a preliminary (non-disjoint) decomposition

[formula]

where, for [formula], we set

[formula]

The next lemma gives the condition under which the two double cosets of the form R(F)h(l,m)sI and R(F)h(l,m)Wws1sI are the same.

For [formula] and m  ≥  0, set βmw: = aϖ2m + bϖmw + cw2. Let s∈W(1). Then R(F)h(l,m)sI  =  R(F)h(l,m)Wws1sI if and only if [formula].

Proof. Suppose [formula]. Take y = ϖm,x = ϖmb / 2 + cw and set [formula]. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

Note that for any s∈W(1), we have s- 1ks∈I. Using rh(l,m)s  =  h(l,m)Wws1s(s- 1ks), we obtain R(F)h(l,m)sI  =  R(F)h(l,m)Wws1sI, as required.

Now we will prove the converse. For s∈W(1), let rs∈R(F) be such that As  =  (h(l,m)Wws1s)- 1rsh(l,m)s∈I. Then, it is possible to conclude that [formula]. Let us illustrate the case s  =  1 and [formula]. Let [formula], where X  =    tX and [formula]. Looking at the (2,2) coefficient of A1, we get y  =  ϖmy', with [formula]. We see that the (1,2) coefficient of A1 is equal to [formula] coefficient of A1  +  βmwy') which lies in [formula]. Since diagonal elements of A1 are in [formula] and [formula], we can conclude that [formula], as required. The other cases are done in a similar way (see [\cite=P1]).

The next lemma describes for which [formula] we have [formula].

For [formula] and m  ≥  0, set βmw: = aϖ2m + bϖmw + cw2 as above.

If m  >  0, then [formula] if and only if [formula].

Let m = 0.

If [formula], then [formula] for every [formula].

Let [formula]. Let w0 be the unique element of [formula] such that [formula], the prime ideal of [formula]. Then [formula] if and only if w  ≠  w0. In case [formula] is odd, one can take w0  =   - b / (2c).

Let [formula]. Then [formula] if and only if [formula].

Proof. Part i) is clear. For the rest of the lemma, we need the following claim.

Claim: We have [formula] if and only if [formula].

The claim follows from the identity

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula] and Lemma [\ref=quadraticextdisclemma-steinberg] ii) implies that [formula] for all [formula]. The claim gives ii)a) of the lemma. Let us now assume that [formula]. In this case, the injective map [formula] gives an isomorphism between the fields [formula]. Let w0  =    -  ι- 1(α) be the unique element in [formula] such that [formula]. In case [formula] is odd, then one can take [formula] since [formula]. Then for any [formula], we have [formula]. Now, the claim gives ii)b) of the lemma. Next assume that [formula]. Since [formula] by assumption, we have [formula]. If [formula] for some [formula], then we have one of [formula] lies in [formula]. Hence, we see that the only choices of w = (w,w) such that [formula] are [formula]. Note that [formula] implies that [formula] are not equal modulo [formula]. This completes the proof of the lemma.

Note that, in the case [formula], ([\ref=useful-identity-beta]) implies that [formula] but [formula] by Lemma [\ref=quadraticextdisclemma-steinberg] ii).

Next, we will show the disjointness of all the relevant double cosets. Set

[formula]

Notice that, for all of the matrices defined above, and any r∈R(F), at least one of the diagonal entries is zero. This implies that none of the above matrices can be in I for any choice of r∈R(F). For [formula], set

[formula]

If s  ≠  t, then at least one of the diagonal entries of A*s,t is zero, implying that it cannot be in I for any choice of r∈R(F). If s  =  t and A*s,t is in I, then we get

[formula]

which is not possible, since [formula]. Hence, A*s,t cannot be in I for any choice of r∈R(F). We summarize in the following proposition.

Let W be the Weyl group of [formula] and W(1)  =  {1,s2,s2s1,s2s1s2}. If [formula], let w0 be the unique element of [formula] such that [formula]. If [formula] is odd, then take w0  =   - b / (2c). Then we have the following disjoint double coset decomposition.

[formula]

Necessary conditions for values of [formula]

In this section, we will obtain the necessary conditions on the values of [formula] on the double coset representatives from Proposition [\ref=disjoint-double-cosets-prop] using I-invariance of B and ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition])-([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]).

[formula]

Note that [formula] if m  ≥  1 and [formula] if m  =  0. Also, c(Λ) is the conductor of Λ only if [formula]. Let us set c(Λ)  =  m0. Since Λ is trivial on F×, we see that [formula].

Let us make a few observations about Λ and c(Λ).

If L is a field, then we have [formula]. If [formula] and m0 = 0, then we have that Λ(ϖL)  =  1, since [formula]. In case [formula] and m0 = 0, we see that Λ(ϖL)  =    ±  1. In general, if L is a field, we see that Λ is a unitary character since m0 is finite.

If L is not a field, then [formula] and Λ((x,y))  =  Λ1(x)Λ2(y), where Λ1,Λ2 are two characters of F× satisfying [formula]. In this case, m0 is the conductor of both Λ1,Λ2 and the character Λ need not be unitary.

In the next lemma, we will describe some coset representatives, which will be used in the evaluation of certain sums involving the character Λ.

Let m  ≥  1. A set of coset representatives for [formula] is given by

[formula]

In the case [formula], the element w0 is the unique element in [formula] such that [formula].

Proof. Let [formula], with [formula]. If m  ≥  2, then [formula]. If [formula], then [formula], and hence corresponds to the coset representative 1. Now, let us assume that [formula]. Then, using [formula], we see that x + αϖm - 1y is equivalent to x / y + αϖm - 1 modulo [formula]. Note that [formula] implies that, modulo [formula], the element x / y lies in

[formula]

This follows from the proof of Lemma [\ref=beta-a-unit-lemma]. A calculation shows (see [\cite=P1]) that if w,w' are equivalent, modulo [formula], to (not necessarily the same) elements in the sets defined in ([\ref=possible-cosets]), then

[formula]

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Depending on the c(Λ), certain values of B have to be zero. This is obtained in the next lemma.

Let c(Λ)  =  m0  ≥  2. Then

[formula]

Let c(Λ)  =  m0  ≥  1 and [formula]. For [formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] . Then

[formula]

Let c(Λ)  =  m0  =  0 and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof. Let us illustrate the proof of i) here. Let m  ≤  m0 - 2. Let [formula], such that Λ(1  +  x  +  αy)  ≠  1. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

which implies that B(h(l,m))  =  0, as required. The other cases are computed in a similar manner (see [\cite=P1]).

From Lemmas [\ref=Lambda-conductor-coset-rep-lemma] and [\ref=conductor-of-lambda-B-vanishing-lemma](i), we obtain the following information on certain character sums involving Λ.

For any l, we have

[formula]

If s∈{1,s1,s2,s2s1} and m  ≥  0, then

[formula]

If s∈{s1s2,s1s2s1,s2s1s2,s1s2s1s2} and m  ≥  0, then

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

If [formula] and s∈{s1s2,s1s2s1,s1s2s1s2}, then

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

Proof. Let us illustrate the proof of i). For any [formula], set

[formula]

Then, for s∈{1,s1,s2,s2s1} and [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Since the conductor of ψ is [formula], we conclude that B(h(l,m)s)  =  0 if l  <  0. The other cases are computed in a similar manner (see [\cite=P1]).

[formula]

Substituting h  =  h(l,m)s2s1 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula], we get for any l,m

[formula]

Substituting h  =  h(l,m)s1s2s1 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula], we get for any m  >  0 and l

[formula]

Let [formula]. Substituting h  =  h( - 1,0)Ww0s1s2s1 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula] and [formula], we get

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Substituting h  =  h(l,0)Wws1s2s1 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula] and [formula], we get for l  ≠   - 1

[formula]

[formula]

Substituting h  =  h(l,m)s2s1s2 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula], we get for l  ≠   - 1

[formula]

Let w  =  0 if m  >  0, w  =  w0 if [formula] and [formula] if [formula]. Substituting h  =  h(l,m)Wws1s2 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula], we get for l  ≠   - 1

[formula]

Substituting h  =  h(l,m)Wws1s2s1s2 in ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) and using that the conductor of ψ is [formula], we get for all l,m

[formula]

[formula]

Hence, by ([\ref=atkin-lehner-steinberg]), we have

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eta-3rd-eqn]) we see that

[formula]

Let [formula] and set [formula]. Then we have the matrix identity

[formula]

This gives us

[formula]

[formula]

Using ([\ref=B(h(l] [\ref=m)s1)-m>0-value]), ([\ref=B(h(l] [\ref=m)s2s1)-value]), ([\ref=B(h(l] [\ref=m)s1s2s1)-m>0-in-terms-of-s1s2-value]), ([\ref=B(h(l] [\ref=m)s2)-value]), ([\ref=B-value-s1s2-in-terms-of-s1]), ([\ref=B-value-lm-s2s1-in-terms-of-l-1-m+1-s1s2s1]) and ([\ref=B-value-l+1-in-terms-of-l]), we get for l  ≥  0,m  ≥  m0  -  1

[formula]

Hence, we conclude that

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula]. Using ([\ref=B-value-s1s2s1-in-terms-of-s1s2]), ([\ref=B-value-s1s2-in-terms-of-s1]), ([\ref=B-value-s1s2s1s2-lm-in-terms-of-s1s2s1]) and ([\ref=B-value-s2s1s2s1-lm-in-terms-of-l+1m-s1]), we get for l  ≥  0

[formula]

which gives us

[formula]

In addition, if m0  =  0 and ωΛ((1,ϖ))  =   - 1, using ([\ref=B(h(l] [\ref=m)s1)-m=0-split-value]), ([\ref=B-value-s1s2-in-terms-of-s1]) and ([\ref=B-value-split-w1s1s2-in-terms-of-w2s1s2]), we get for all l  ≥  0

[formula]

Summarizing the calculations of the values of B, we obtain

Let c(Λ)  =  m0. For [formula], let us set

We have the following necessary conditions on the values of [formula].

Well-definedness of B

In this section, we will show that a function B on H(F), which is right I-invariant, satisfies ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition]) and with values on the double coset representatives of [formula] given by Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], is well defined. Hence, we have to show that

[formula]

for r1,r2∈R(F),k1,k2∈I and any double coset representative s. This is obtained in the following proposition.

Let s be any double coset representative from Proposition [\ref=disjoint-double-cosets-prop] and the values B(s) be as in Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop]. Let t∈T(F),u∈U(F) such that s- 1tus∈I. Then

[formula]

Proof. Let [formula] and [formula], with [formula]. First let s  =  h(l,m)s' with s'∈W. If s'∈{s1,s1s2,s1s2s1,s1s2s1s2} then we only consider m  >  0. Observe that [formula]. (In the split case, we consider the same identity with [formula]). Let us assume s- 1tus∈I. For any s', we see that [formula]. If s'∈{1,s2,s2s1,s2s1s2} we have [formula] and [formula]. If s'∈{s1,s1s2,s1s2s1,s1s2s1s2} we obtain [formula] and [formula]. Hence, for any s', we conclude that [formula]. This gives us

[formula]

Now looking at the values of B(h(l,m)s'),s'∈W from Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], we get that either B(s)  =  0 or Λ(t)  =  θ(u)  =  1.

We will illustrate one other case, s  =  h(l,0)Ww0s1s2, since it is the most complicated. Here, w0 is the unique element of [formula] such that [formula]. If m0  ≥  1 or l  ≤   - 2, then we have B(s)  =  0. Hence, assume that m0 = 0 and l  ≥   - 1. Note that [formula] and [formula]. We see that s- 1tus∈I implies that

[formula]

Hence, we see that [formula]. This implies that [formula] and Λ(t)  =  1. We have

[formula]

If l  ≥  0, then we get θ(u)  =  1, as required. If l  =   - 1, then let

[formula]

Set ε1  =  x  +  (b / 2 + cw0)y,ε2  =  x  -  (b / 2 + cw0)y. Using the fact that X is symmetric and [formula], we conclude that [formula]. Now θ(u)  =  ψ(tr(SX)) is equal to

[formula]

Here, we have used that [formula] and ψ is trivial on [formula]. The other cases are computed in a similar manner (see [\cite=P1]).

Criterion for [formula]

In the previous sections, we have explicitly obtained a well-defined function B, which is right I-invariant and satisfies ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition]). The values of B on the double coset representatives of [formula] were obtained, in Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], using one or more of the conditions ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1])-([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]). To show that the function B is actually an element of [formula], we have to show that the conditions ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1])-([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) are satisfied by B for every h∈H(F). In fact, it is sufficient to show that B satisfies ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1])-([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]) when h is any double coset representative of [formula]. The computations for checking this are long but not complicated (see [\cite=P1]). We will describe the calculation for h  =  h(l,m) below.

For [formula], we have the matrix identities

[formula]

Using ([\ref=useful-matrix-identity-w]) and Lemmas [\ref=coset-collapse-criterion-lemma], [\ref=beta-a-unit-lemma], [\ref=Lambda-character-sum-lemma], we have

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], we see, for every value of [formula], that the above quantity is equal to zero. Next, we have

[formula]

Here, we have again used Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop] and the identities Al - 1,m  =  ( - ωq3)Al,m. Finally, using ([\ref=useful-matrix-identity-y]),

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], if l  ≤   - 1, then both B(h(l,m)) and B(h(l,m)s2) are equal to zero, and if l  ≥  0, then B(h(l,m)s2)  =   - 1 / qB(h(l,m)). Hence, in either case, the above quantity is zero.

This shows that, for h  =  h(l,m), the function B satisfies ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]) - ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]), as required. The calculation for other values of h follows in a similar manner (see [\cite=P1]). Hence, we get the following theorem.

Let Λ be a character of L×. Let [formula] be the space of smooth functions on H(F), which are right I-invariant, satisfy ([\ref=bessel-model-defining-condition]) and the Hecke conditions ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-1]) - ([\ref=hecke-operator-steinberg-2]). Then

[formula]

Note that the condition on Λ, in the case [formula], follows from Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], iv)a) and iv)c).

Existence of Bessel model

In this section we will obtain the existence of a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π. In case Λ is a unitary character, we will act with the Hecke algebra of H(F) on a non-zero function in [formula]. We will define an inner product on this Hecke module and also show that the Hecke module has a unique, up to a constant, function which is right I-invariant (the same function that we started with). This will lead to the proof that the Hecke module is irreducible and is isomorphic to π, thus giving a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π.

In case Λ is not unitary (this can happen only if [formula]) we will obtain a Bessel model for π using the Whittaker model.

[formula]

We refer the reader to [\cite=Car] for details on Hecke algebras of p-adic groups and Hecke modules. Let Λ be a character of L× such that [formula]. Let [formula] be the unique, up to a constant, function whose values are described in Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop]. Define the action of f∈H on B by

[formula]

This is a finite sum and hence converges for all f. Let

[formula]

Since [formula], we see that VB is a Hecke module. Note that every function in VB transforms on the left according to [formula].

The norm

[formula]

is finite. In particular,

[formula]

Here, Cm: = B(h(0,m)) and the measure is normalized so that vol(KH)  =  1.

Proof. We have

[formula]

Here, [formula]. To get the last equality, we argue as in Lemma 3.7.1 of [\cite=PS1]. The volume of Is can be computed by similar methods to Sect. 3.7.1, 3.7.2 of [\cite=PS1]. Now, using the values of B(s) from Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop] and geometric series, we get the result (see [\cite=P1]).

Let [formula]. The previous lemma tells us that [formula]. It is an easy exercise to see that, in fact, for any f∈H, we have [formula]. Now, we see that VB inherits the inner product from [formula]. For f1,f2∈H, we obtain

[formula]

For f∈H, define [formula] by [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Proof. The lemma follows by a formal calculation.

Irreducibility of VB

Let [formula] be the subspace of functions in VB that are right I-invariant. Then

[formula]

Proof. We know that [formula] is not trivial since [formula]. Let [formula] be the characteristic function of I and set [formula]. Then, by definition, any B'∈VIB, satisfies [formula]. Let f∈H be such that [formula]. Here, we have used that [formula]. Then

[formula]

But [formula], the Iwahori Hecke algebra. Since B is an eigenfunction of [formula], we see that [formula]. Hence, [formula], as required.

Let [formula] be the Steinberg representation of H(F), twisted by an unramified, quadratic character Ω. Let Λ be a character of L× such that [formula]. Let VB be as in ([\ref=Hecke-module-defn]). If Λ is unitary, then VB is irreducible and isomorphic to π.

Proof. Let us assume, to the contrary, that VB is reducible. Let W be an H-invariant subspace. Let [formula] be the complement of W in VB with respect to the inner product 〈  ,  〉 defined in ([\ref=norm-on-V-defn]). Using Lemma [\ref=adjoint-lemma], we see that [formula] is also H-invariant. Write B  =  B1  +  B2, with [formula]. Let [formula] be as defined in the proof of Lemma [\ref=V-B^I-is-one-dimensional-lemma]. Since [formula] are H-invariant, we see that [formula] and [formula]. Since B is right I-invariant, we see that [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=V-B^I-is-one-dimensional-lemma], we obtain, either B  =  B1 or B  =  B2. Since VB is generated by B, we have either W  =  VB or W  =  0. Hence, we see that VB is an irreducible Hecke module, which contains a unique, up to a constant, vector which is right I-invariant. This uniquely characterizes the Steinberg representation of H(F), and hence, VB is isomorphic to π.

Let [formula] be such that b2 - 4ac is a square in F×. One can find a matrix [formula] such that [formula]. In this case, [formula] The group TS'(F) embedded in H(F) is given by

[formula]

Let θ' be the character of U(F) obtained from S' and Λ' be the character of TS'(F) obtained from Λ. Then it is easy to see that π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model if and only if it has a (Λ',θ')-Bessel model. So, we will assume that [formula].

Let (π,V) be an irreducible, admissible representation of H(F). For c1,c2∈F×, consider the character ψc1,c2 of the unipotent radical N(F) of the Borel subgroup given by

[formula]

The representation π of H(F) is called generic if [formula]. In this case there is an associated Whittaker model W(π,ψc1,c2) consisting of functions [formula] that transform on the left according to ψc1,c2. For W∈W(π,ψc1,c2), there is an associated zeta integral

[formula]

This integral is convergent for Re(s) > s0, where s0 is independent of W ([\cite=RS], Proposition 2.6.3). More precisely, the integral converges to an element of [formula], and therefore has meromorphic continuation to all of [formula]. Moreover, there exists an L-factor of the form

[formula]

such that

[formula]

(This is proved in [\cite=RS] Proposition 2.6.4 for π with trivial central character.)

Let (π,V) be an irreducible, admissible, generic representation of H(F) with trivial central character. Let σ be a unitary character of F×, and let [formula] be arbitrary. Then there exists a non-zero functional [formula] with the following properties.

For all x,y,z∈F and v∈V,

[formula]

For all x∈F× and v∈V,

[formula]

Proof: We may assume that V = W(π,ψc1,c2). Let [formula] be such that Z(s,W) is absolutely convergent for Re(s) > s0. Then the integral

[formula]

is also absolutely convergent for Re(s) > s0, since σ is unitary. Note that these are the zeta integrals for the twisted representation σπ. Therefore, by ([\ref=zetaLquotienteq]), the quotient Zσ(s,W) / L(s,σπ) is in [formula] for all W∈W(π,ψc1,c2). Now, for Re(s) > s0, we define

[formula]

Straightforward calculations show that ([\ref=GSp4genericlemmaeq1]) and ([\ref=GSp4genericlemmaeq2]) are satisfied. For general s, since the quotient ([\ref=GSp4genericlemmaeq3]) is entire, we can define fs,σ by analytic continuation.

Let (π,V) be an irreducible, admissible, generic representation of H(F) with trivial central character. Then π admits a split Bessel functional with respect to any character Λ of T(F) that satisfies [formula].

Proof: As mentioned earlier, we can take [formula]. Let [formula] and σ be a unitary character of F× such that

[formula]

Let fs,σ be as in Lemma [\ref=GSp4genericlemma]. We may assume that c1 = 1, so that fs,σ(π(u)v) = θ(u)v for all u∈U(F) by ([\ref=GSp4genericlemmaeq1]). We have

[formula]

by ([\ref=GSp4genericlemmaeq2]). Since [formula] we in fact obtain fs,σ(π(t)v) = Λ(t)fs,σ(v) for all t∈T(F). Hence fs,σ is a Bessel functional as desired.

Let us remark here that, in the split case, for values of [formula] outside the range of convergence of the zeta integral, we do not have an explicit formula for the Bessel functional. This, in turn, is also reflected in the fact that it is not very easy to define an inner product on the space VB (defined in ([\ref=Hecke-module-defn])), although it is known that the Steinberg representation is square-integrable.

Let [formula] be the Steinberg representation of H(F), twisted by an unramified quadratic character Ω. Let Λ be a character of L× such that [formula]. If L is a field, then π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model if and only if [formula]. If L is not a field, then π always has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model. In case π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model, it is unique.

In addition, if π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model, then the Iwahori spherical vector of π is a test vector for the Bessel functional if and only if Λ satisfies the following conditions.

[formula], i.e., c(Λ)  ≤  1 (see ([\ref=c(Lambda)-defn]) for definition of c(Λ)).

If [formula] and Λ is unramified, then Λ((1,ϖ))  ≠  Ω(ϖ).

Proof. If π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model, then it contains a unique vector in [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=B(lambda-theta)^I-dimension-theorem], the dimension of [formula] is one, which gives us the uniqueness of Bessel models.

Now we will show the existence of the Bessel model. Let Λ be a character of L×, with [formula], such that, if L is a field, [formula] . We know, by Proposition [\ref=B(lambda-theta)^I-dimension-theorem], that [formula]. If Λ is unitary, then Proposition [\ref=irreducibility-of-VB] tells us that VB is a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model for π. If Λ is not unitary, then we use the fact that π is a generic representation in the split case. Then Proposition [\ref=GSp4genericprop] gives us the result.

The statement regarding the test vector can be deduced from Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop] and the fact that a Bessel function B corresponds to a test vector if and only if B(1)  ≠  0.

Integral representation of the non-archimedean local L-function

In this section, using the explicit values of the Bessel function obtained in Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], we will obtain an integral representation of the L-function for the Steinberg representation π of H(F) twisted by any irreducible, admissible representation τ of [formula]. For this, we will use the integral obtained by Furusawa in [\cite=Fu]. Let us briefly describe the setup.

The unitary group, parabolic induction and the local integral

Let [formula] be the unitary similitude group, whose F-points are given by

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that [formula]. As a minimal parabolic subgroup we choose the subgroup of all matrices that become upper triangular after switching the last two rows and last two columns. Let P be the standard maximal parabolic subgroup of G(F) with a non-abelian unipotent radical. Let P  =  MN be the Levi decomposition of P. We have M  =  M(1)M(2), where

[formula]

The modular factor of the parabolic P is given by

[formula]

where |  ·  | is the normalized absolute value on F. Let (τ,Vτ) be an irreducible, admissible representation of [formula], and let χ0 be a character of L× such that [formula] coincides with ωτ, the central character of τ. Let us assume that Vτ is the Whittaker model of τ with respect to the character ψ- c (we assume that c  ≠  0). Then the representation (λ,g)  ↦  χ0(λ)τ(g) of [formula] factors through {(λ,λ- 1):  λ∈F×}, and consequently defines a representation of M(2)(F) on the same space Vτ. Let χ be a character of L×, considered as a character of M(1)(F). Extend the representation χ  ×  χ0  ×  τ of M(F) to a representation of P(F) by setting it to be trivial on N(F). If s is a complex parameter, set I(s,χ,χ0,τ) = IndG(F)P(F)(δs + 1 / 2P  ×  χ  ×  χ0  ×  τ).

Let (π,Vπ) be the twisted Steinberg representation of H(F). We assume that Vπ is a Bessel model for π with respect to a character [formula] of R(F). Let the characters χ,χ0 and Λ be related by

[formula]

Let W#(    ·    ,s) be an element of I(s,χ,χ0,τ) for which the restriction of W#(    ·    ,s) to the standard maximal compact subgroup of G(F) is independent of s, i.e., W#(    ·    ,s) is a "flat section" of the family of induced representations I(s,χ,χ0,τ). By Lemma 2.3.1 of [\cite=PS1], it is meaningful to consider the integral

[formula]

where

[formula]

This is the local component of the global integral considered in Sect. [\ref=global-repn-integral] below.

The [formula] newform

Let us define [formula] and, for n > 0,

[formula]

As above, let (τ,Vτ) be a generic, irreducible, admissible representation of [formula] such that Vτ is the ψ- c-Whittaker model of τ. It is well known that Vτ has a unique (up to a constant) vector W(1), called the newform, that is right-invariant under [formula] for some n  ≥  0. We then say that τ has conductor [formula]. Let us normalize W(1) so that W(1)(1)  =  1. We will need the values of W(1) evaluated at [formula], for l  ≥  0. The following table gives these values (refer Sect. 2.4 [\cite=Sc1]).

[formula]

We extend W(1) to a function on M(2)(F) via

[formula]

Choice of Λ and W#

We will choose a character Λ of L× such that π has a (Λ,θ)-Bessel model and the Iwahori spherical vector is a test vector for the Bessel functional. Noting that Λ|F× is the central character of π and using Theorem [\ref=existence-theorem], we impose the following conditions on Λ.

[formula]

If L is a field, then [formula]

c(Λ)  ≤  1

If L is not a field and c(Λ)  =  0, then ωΛ((1,ϖ))  ≠   - 1.

Note that this implies that [formula]. For n  ≥  1, let [formula] be the principal congruence subgroup of the maximal compact subgroup [formula] of G(F), defined by

[formula]

We prove the following lemma, which will be crucial for the well-definedness of W# below.

Let (τ,Vτ) be a generic, irreducible, admissible representation of [formula] with conductor [formula]. Set n0  =   max{1,n} and let

[formula]

Suppose we have [formula]. Then we get

[formula] and [formula].

for any [formula],

[formula]

Proof. Using Lemma [\ref=quadraticextdisclemma-steinberg] i), it is easy to show that for n  ≥  0

[formula]

First note that [formula]. Looking at the (4,1),(4,2) coefficient of A, we see that [formula]. By ([\ref=something-in-pn]), we obtain [formula], as required.

Observe that n̂∈KG and [formula] implies that [formula]. The upper left 2  ×  2 block of A is given by

[formula]

We will repeatedly use the following fact:

[formula]

For, if x = y + αz with [formula] and [formula], then x - x̄ = (α  -  )z. Applying this to the matrix entries of A, we get [formula], and then

[formula]

Using [formula] and ([\ref=a'-zeta-condition]), we get from the (2,1) coefficient of A that

[formula]

Hence [formula], so that [formula], as required. This proves part i) of the lemma.

Looking at the (1,2) coefficient of A, we see that [formula]. Looking at the (1,1) coefficient of A, we see that [formula].

[formula]

Here, we have used the fact that Λ is trivial on [formula] is trivial on [formula] and the matrix [formula] lies in [formula].

Let n0  =   max{1,n}, as above. Given a complex number s, define the function [formula] as follows.

If [formula], then W#(g,s) = 0.

If g = mnηkγ with m∈M(F), n∈N(F), k∈I, [formula], then W#(g,s) = W#(mη,s).

For ζ∈L× and [formula],

[formula]

Here μ  =  d' - b'.

By Lemma [\ref=well-defined-sub-lemma], we see that W# is well-defined. It is an element of I(s,χ,χ0,τ).

Support of W#

Let us choose W# as above and B as in Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop], with B(1)  =  1. Note that B(1)  ≠  0 by the comments in the begining of Sect. [\ref=choice-of-W]. Then the integral ([\ref=localZseq]) becomes

[formula]

where t runs through the double coset representatives from Proposition [\ref=disjoint-double-cosets-prop] and

[formula]

To compute ([\ref=integral-as-a-sum-1]), we need to find out for what values of l,m,t is ηh(l,m)t in the support of W#. Write ηh(l,m)  =  h(l,m)ηm, where

[formula]

Since h(l,m)∈M(F), we need to know for which values of m,t is ηmt in the support of W#. This is done in the following lemma.

Let t be any double coset representative from Proposition [\ref=disjoint-double-cosets-prop]. Then ηmt lies in the support, [formula], of W# if and only if m = 0 and t = 1.

Proof. Let us first consider the case m  >  0. Note that it is enough to show that [formula]. For any double coset representative t, we have [formula] and hence [formula]. So it is enough to show that [formula] for any t. Suppose, there are ∈M,n̂∈N such that [formula]. Using ,n̂∈KG and

[formula]

we get a contradiction for every t∈W. Let us now consider the case m  =  0. First let t = 1. Taking   =  n̂  =  1, we easily see that [formula], as required. Now assume that t  ≠  1. Suppose, there are ∈M,n̂∈N such that [formula]. Again, using ,n̂∈KG and ([\ref=I-Gamma-description]) we get a contradiction for t  ≠  1 (see [\cite=P1] for details). This completes the proof of the lemma.

Integral computation

From Lemma [\ref=etam-t-in-supp-Wsharp], we see that the integral ([\ref=integral-as-a-sum-1]) is equal to

[formula]

Arguing as in Sect. 3.5 of [\cite=Fu], we get

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop] and ([\ref=Wsharpformulaeq-steinberg]), we get

[formula]

Let us set [formula]. We have

[formula]

We will now substitute the value of W(1), from the table obtained in Sect. [\ref=the-GL2-newform-section], into ([\ref=simplified-integral-as-a-sum-2]) for all possible [formula] representations τ.

Let [formula] denote the contragradient of the representation τ. We have the following L-functions for the representation [formula], with Ω unramified and quadratic, twisted by [formula].

[formula]

From ([\ref=tau-unramified-integral-formula])-([\ref=twisted-L-function]), we get the following theorem on the integral representation of L-functions.

Let [formula] be the Steinberg representation of [formula] twisted by an unramified, quadratic character Ω. Let τ be any irreducible, admissible representation of [formula]. Let Z(s) be the integral defined in ([\ref=ZsWdefeq]). Choose B as in Sect. [\ref=bessel-model-section] and W# as in Sect. [\ref=choice-of-W]. Then we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here, [formula].

Global theory

In the previous section, we computed the non-archimedean integral representation of the L-function L(s,π  ×  ) for the Steinberg representation of [formula] twisted by any [formula] representation. In [\cite=Fu], the integral has been computed for both π and τ unramified. In [\cite=PS2], the integral has been calculated for an unramified representation π twisted by any ramified [formula] representation τ. Also, in [\cite=PS2], the archimedean integral has been computed for π∞ a holomorphic (or limit of holomorphic) discrete series representation with scalar minimal K-type, and τ∞ any representation of [formula]. In this section, we will put together all the local computations and obtain an integral representation of a global L-function. We will start with a Siegel cuspidal newform F of weight l with respect to the Borel congruence subgroup of square-free level. We will obtain an integral representation of the L-function of F twisted by any irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representation τ of [formula]. When τ is obtained from a holomorphic cusp form of the same weight l as F, we obtain a special value result for the L-function, in the spirit of Deligne's conjectures.

Siegel modular form and Bessel model

Let M be a square-free positive integer and l be any positive integer. Let

[formula]

Let F be a Siegel newform of weight l with respect to B(M). We refer the reader to Sect. 8 of [\cite=Sa] or [\cite=Sc] for definition and details on newforms with square-free level. The Fourier expansion of F is given by

[formula]

where T runs over all semi-integral, symmetric, positive definite 2  ×  2 matrices. We obtain a well-defined function Φ  =  ΦF on [formula], where [formula] is the ring of adeles of [formula], by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula]. Let VF be the space generated by the right translates of ΦF and let πF be one of the irreducible components. Then [formula], where π∞ is a holomorphic discrete series representation of [formula] of lowest weight (l,l), for a finite prime [formula], πp is an irreducible, unramified representation of [formula], and for p|M, πp is a twist [formula] of the Steinberg representation of [formula] by an unramified, quadratic character Ωp.

For a positive integer [formula], set

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be the adelic points of the group defined in ([\ref=TRthetaeq1]). Let [formula] be the Bessel subgroup of [formula]. Let Λ be a character of

[formula]

where, [formula] and [formula]. Here [formula]. Note that, under the isomorphism ([\ref=T-isomorphic-to-L]), T0p corresponds to [formula], where [formula] is the ring of integers of the two dimensional algebra [formula]. Let ψ be a character of [formula] that is trivial on [formula] for all primes p and satisfies ψ(x) = e- 2πix for all [formula]. We define the global Bessel function of type (Λ,θ) associated to [formula] by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. If [formula] is non-zero, then [formula] is non-zero for any φ∈πF. We say that πF has a global Bessel model of type (Λ,θ) if [formula]. We shall make the following assumption on the representation πF.

Assumption: πF has a global Bessel model of type (Λ,θ) such that

In [\cite=Fu], [\cite=PS1], [\cite=PS2] and [\cite=Sa], non-vanishing of a suitable Fourier coefficient of F is assumed, while in [\cite=PS], the existence of a suitable global Bessel model for πF is assumed. Let us explain the relation of the above assumption to non-vanishing of certain Fourier coefficients of F. Let {tj} be a set of representatives for ([\ref=T(A)-group]). One can take [formula]. Write tj  =  γjmjκj, with [formula] and [formula]. Set [formula]. Note that {Sj}j is a subset of the set of representatives of Γ0(M) equivalence classes of primitive, semi-integral positive definite 2  ×  2 matrices of discriminant - D.

From [\cite=Sa] or [\cite=Su], we have, for [formula],

[formula]

and [formula] for [formula]. Suppose that there is a semi-integral, symmetric, positive definite 2  ×  2 matrix T satisfying

- D  =   det (2T) is the fundamental discriminant of [formula].

T is Γ0(M) equivalent to one of the Sj.

The Fourier coefficient A(T)  ≠  0.

Then it is clear from ([\ref=Bessel_model_arch_formula]) that one can choose a Λ such that parts 1,A2 of the assumption are satisfied. If M = 1 (as in [\cite=Fu], [\cite=PS1], [\cite=PS2]) or, every prime p|M is inert in L (as in [\cite=Sa]), then {Sj}j is the complete set of representatives of Γ0(M) equivalence classes and hence, condition i) above implies condition ii) to give the assumption from [\cite=Fu], [\cite=PS1], [\cite=PS2] and [\cite=Sa]. We have to include part 3 of the assumption to guarantee that the Iwahori spherical vector in πp, for p|M, is a test vector for the Bessel functional.

Let us abbreviate [formula]. For [formula], we have

[formula]

where, B∞ is as defined in [\cite=PS2], for a finite prime [formula], Bp is the spherical vector in the (Λp,θp)-Bessel model for πp, and for p|M, Bp is the vector in the (Λp,θp)-Bessel model for πp defined by Proposition [\ref=values-of-B-prop] and [\ref=well-defined-proposition]. For p  <    ∞  , we have normalized the Bp so that Bp(1)  =  1.

Global induced representation and global integral

Let [formula] be an irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representation of [formula] with central character ωτ. For every prime p  <    ∞  , let pnp be the conductor of τp. For almost all p, we have np  =  0. Set [formula]. Choose l1 to be any weight occurring in τ∞. Let χ0 be a character of [formula] such that [formula] and χ0,  ∞(ζ)  =  ζl2 for any ζ∈S1. Here, l2 depends on l1 and l by the formula

[formula]

as in [\cite=PS2]. The existence of such a character is guaranteed by Lemma 5.3.1 of [\cite=PS2]. Define another character χ of [formula] by

[formula]

Let I(s,χ0,χ,τ) be the induced representation of [formula] obtained in an analogous way to the local situation in Sect. [\ref=local-induced-repn-section]. We will now define a global section fΛ(g,s). Let us realize the representation τ as a subspace of [formula] and let [formula] be the automorphic cusp form such that the space of τ is generated by the right translates of [formula]. The function [formula] corresponds to a cuspidal Hecke newform on the complex upper half plane. Then, [formula] is factorizable. Write [formula] such that ∞ is the function of weight l1 in τ∞. For p  <    ∞  , p is the unique newform in τp with p(1)  =  1. Using χ0, extend [formula] to a function of [formula].

For a finite prime p, set

[formula]

Here, in the second case, np,0  =   max(1,np). Set [formula] and let K∞ be the maximal compact subgroup of [formula]. Let η be the element of [formula] defined in ([\ref=eta-defn]). Let ηM,N be the element of [formula] such that the p-component is given by η for p|MN and by 1 for [formula]. For [formula], define fΛ(    ·    ,s) on [formula] by

fΛ(g,s)  =  0 if [formula].

If m  =  m1m2, [formula], [formula], k  =  k0k∞, k0∈KG(M,N), k∞∈K∞, then

[formula]

Recall that [formula].

Here, [formula], [formula], [formula] are the adelic points of the algebraic groups defined by ([\ref=M1-M2-N-defn]) and f is the function on K∞ defined in [\cite=PS2] as follows

[formula]

Here, we have [formula]. As in [\cite=PS2], it can be checked that fΛ is well-defined. For Re(s) large enough we can form the Eisenstein series

[formula]

In fact, E(g,s;fΛ) has a meromorphic continuation to the entire plane. In [\cite=Fu], Furusawa studied integrals of the form

[formula]

where φ∈Vπ. Theorem (2.4) of [\cite=Fu], the "Basic Identity", states that

[formula]

where Bφ is the Bessel function corresponding to φ and WfΛ is the function defined by

[formula]

The function WfΛ is a pure tensor and we can write [formula]. Then we see that W#∞ is as defined in [\cite=PS2]. For a finite prime [formula], the W#p is the function defined in Sect. 4.5 of [\cite=PS2]. For p|M, the W#p is as in Sect. [\ref=choice-of-W]. It follows from ([\ref=basicidentityeq]) that

[formula]

where

[formula]

When [formula], the integral Zp is evaluated in [\cite=Fu]. For p  =    ∞   or [formula], the integral Zp is calculated in Theorems 3.5.1 and 4.4.1 of [\cite=PS2]. For p|M, the integral Zp is calculated in Theorem [\ref=steinberg-int-rep-L-fn]. Putting all of this together we get the following global theorem.

Let F be a Siegel cuspidal newform of weight l with respect to B(M), where l is any positive integer and M is square-free, satisfying the assumption stated in Sect. [\ref=Siegel-mod-form-section]. Let Φ be the adelic function corresponding to F, and let πF be an irreducible component of the cuspidal, automorphic representation generated by Φ. Let τ be any irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representation of [formula]. Let the global characters χ, χ0 and Λ, as well as the global section fΛ∈I(s,χ,χ0,τ), be chosen as above. Then the global integral ([\ref=globalintegraleq]) is given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

Here, (Λ) is the automorphic representation of [formula] obtained from Λ via automorphic induction. The factor Yp(s) is one for [formula]. For [formula], the factor Yp(s) is given in Theorem 3.5.1 of [\cite=PS2]. For p|M, we have Yp(s)  =  Lp(6s + 1,ω- 1τp)L(3s + 1,p  ×  (Λp))Y'p(s), where Y'p(s) is given in Theorem [\ref=steinberg-int-rep-L-fn]. The number r and a+ are as in the archimedean calculation in [\cite=PS2], and the constant a(Λ) is defined in Sect. [\ref=Siegel-mod-form-section].

Special values of L-functions

In this section, we will use Theorem [\ref=global-thm] to obtain a special value result for the L-function in the case that τ corresponds to a holomorphic cusp form of the same weight as F. Let Ψ∈Sl(N,χ'), the space of holomorphic cusp forms on the complex upper half plane [formula] of weight l with respect to Γ0(N) and nebentypus χ'. Here [formula] is any positive integer and χ' is a Dirichlet character modulo N. Ψ has a Fourier expansion

[formula]

We will assume that Ψ is primitive, which means that Ψ is a newform, a Hecke eigenform and is normalized so that b1  =  1. Let [formula] be the character of [formula] defined as the composition

[formula]

Let [formula] with the local congruence subgroups [formula] as in ([\ref=K1defeq]). Let [formula], where [formula]. Evidently, K(0)(N)  ⊂  K0(N). Let λ be the character of K0(N) given by

[formula]

With these notations, we now define the adelic function fΨ by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and k∈K0(N). Define a character χ0, as in the previous section, with l2  =   - l. Using χ0, extend fΨ to a function on [formula]. We can take   =  fΨ in ([\ref=section_definition]) and obtain the section fΛ. Now, Lemma 5.4.2 of [\cite=PS2] gives us that, for [formula], the function μ2(g)- l det (J(g,i12))lE(g,s;fΛ) only depends on Z  =  g〈i12〉. Let us define the function E on [formula] by the formula

[formula]

where [formula] is such that g〈i12〉  =  Z. The series that defines E(Z,s) is absolutely convergent for Re(s)  >  3  -  l / 2 (see [\cite=Kl1]). Let us assume that l  >  6. Now, we can set s = 0 and obtain a holomorphic Eisenstein series E(Z,0) on [formula]. Let [formula]. We have [formula]. Then E(Z,0) is a modular form of weight l with respect to ΓG(M,N). Its restriction to [formula], the Siegel upper half space, is a modular form of weight l with respect to B(M). By [\cite=Ha], we know that the Fourier coefficients of E(Z,0) are algebraic.

Set [formula] and define, for any two Siegel modular forms F1,F2 of weight l with respect to B(M), the Petersson inner product by

[formula]

Arguing as in Lemma 5.6.2 of [\cite=PS2] or Proposition 9.0.5 of [\cite=Sa], we get

[formula]

Let [formula] be the principal congruence subgroup of [formula]. Let us denote the space of all Siegel cusp forms of weight l with respect to Γ(2)(M) by Sl(Γ(2)(M)). For a Hecke eigenform F∈Sl(Γ(2)(M)), let [formula] be the subfield of [formula] generated by all the Hecke eigenvalues of F. From [\cite=Ga1], we see that [formula] is a totally real number field. Let [formula] be the subspace of Sl(Γ(2)(M)) consisting of cusp forms whose Fourier coefficients lie in [formula]. Again by [\cite=Ga1], Sl(Γ(2)(M)) has an orthogonal basis {Fi} of Hecke eigenforms [formula]. In addition, if F is a Hecke eigenform such that [formula], then one can take F1  =  F in the above basis. Hence, let us assume that the Siegel newform F of weight l with respect to B(M) considered in the previous section satisfies [formula]. Then, arguing as in Lemma 5.4.3 of [\cite=PS1], we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the algebraic closure of [formula] in [formula]. Let [formula], where [formula]. We have the following generalization of Theorem 4.8.3 of [\cite=Fu].

Let l,M be positive integers such that l  >  6 and M is square-free. Let F be a cuspidal Siegel newform of weight l with respect to B(M) such that [formula], satisfying the assumption from Sect. [\ref=Siegel-mod-form-section]. Let Ψ∈Sl(N,χ') be a primitive form, with [formula], any positive integer, and χ', any Dirichlet character modulo N. Let πF and τΨ be the irreducible, cuspidal, automorphic representations of [formula] and [formula] corresponding to F and Ψ. Then

[formula]

Proof. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 5.7.1 of [\cite=PS2], together with ([\ref=int-as-inner-prod]) and ([\ref=inner-prod-is-alg]), we get the theorem.

Special value results like the one above have been obtained in [\cite=BH], [\cite=Fu], [\cite=PS1], [\cite=PS2] and [\cite=Sa].
