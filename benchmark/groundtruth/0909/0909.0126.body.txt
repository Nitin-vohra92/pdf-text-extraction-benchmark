Generalized controlled phase QGE

Introduction

There are several schemes for quantum computation, e.g., standard scheme which is called quantum circuit model. An alternate scheme is called measurement-based quantum computation which is also called cluster state scheme or one-way quantum computer. The structure of cluster state scheme is very interesting and it is not yet fully uncovered [\cite=Raus] [\cite=Nil] [\cite=Hein]. In the standard scheme the processing of the qubit is based on a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates which are unitary transformations. However, cluster state model differs from unitary scheme of quantum computation. One important class of these quantum gates is called the quantum gate entangler such as controlled not or controlled phase gates. Recently, we have constructed quantum gate entangler for multi-qubit states and general multipartite states [\cite=Hosh1] [\cite=Hosh2]. In this paper we will construct quantum gate entangler based on generalized controlled phase gate for multi-qubit states. In section [\ref=SPRT] we will give a short introduction to the standard quantum controlled phased gate and construction of cluster state based on this quantum gate entangler. In section [\ref=gen] we construct a generalized controlled phase gate for multi-qubit state. Then we will show how this gate could transform any product state to an entangle state. In section [\ref=three] we will give an illustrative example of generalized controlled phase gate construction for three-qubit states and we compare this construction with a three-qubit graph state. We also give a physical implementation of control phase gate and its generalization for multi-qubit states. This is a generalization of Hamiltonian of two spin systems. In following sections we need the definition of a complex projective space [formula] which is defined to be the set of lines through the origin in [formula], that is, [formula], where the equivalence relation ~   is defined as follow; [formula] for [formula], where yi  =  λxi for all 0  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Controlled phase gate and cluster state

In this section we will give short introduction to controlled phase gate and cluster state generated by this gate. Let [formula] be a gate that acts on a qubit as Z|0〉 = |0〉 and Z|1〉 =  - |1〉 Then, in a controlled phase gate CZ, the first qubit acts as the control qubit and the second qubit acts as the target qubit. If the first qubit is 1, then we apply a Z gate to the second qubit and if first qubit is 0, then we apply an identity gate to the second qubit. In matrix form it is given by

[formula]

where I2 is a 2-by-2 identity matrix. This controlled phase gate can entangle a quantum state. For example, let [formula]. Then, by applying the CZ to a product two-qubit state we get a cluster state

[formula]

It is easy to check that this state is an entangled two-qubit state. Note that the CZ gate is a special case of the following general gate

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula], for eiφ0 = eiφ1 = eiφ2 = 1, and eiφ3 =  - 1. In following section we will generalize this construction of controlled phase gate for a two-qubit state into a multi-qubit state.

Generalized controlled phase gate entangler for multi-qubit states

In this section we will construct a generalized controlled phase gate entangler for multi-qubit state. We will also in detail discuss this operator for three-qubit states. For a multi-qubit state

[formula]

we define a generalized controlled phase gate Z2m  ×  2m by

[formula]

where [formula] for all [formula]. For example for x = 0 we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are zero matrices and [formula] is an identity matrix. Note that all decomposition matrices [formula] and [formula] for all [formula] commute, that is = 0.

There is also a geometrical interpretation of this transformation based on the Lie group. We define a Lie group to be a differentiable manifold G that satisfies a product map G  ×  G  →  G given by (g,h)  ↦  gh which make G into a group. This map and the map G  →  G given by g  ↦  g- 1 need to be differentiable. An example of Lie group G = T2m is the abelian group of diagonal matrices of the form

[formula]

This Lie group is topologically [formula], that is 2m-times topological product of S1 which can be identified by 2m-torus. The subgroup T2m of unitary group U(2m) is called a maximal torus of U(2m) and any conjugate hT2mh- 1 of maximal torus is also called a maximal torus. Thus, we can see that our transformation [formula] is a maximal torus if we assume that

[formula]

Then, we have following theorem.

Let Z2m  ×  2m be a generalized controlled phase gate given by equation ([\ref=Rmat]). Then, the state

[formula]

with [formula] is entangled if and only if elements of Z2m  ×  2m satisfy

[formula]

for all [formula], where [formula] is complex projective space of dimension 2m - 1. The proof of this theorem follows from the Segre variety

[formula]

which is the image of the Segre embedding and is an intersection of families of quadric hypersurfaces in [formula] that represents the completely decomposable tensor [\cite=Hosh3].

Examples of controlled phase gate for multi-qubit systems

To visualize our construction we will first construct a generalized controlled phased gate entangler for a three-qubit state and then discuss a physically implementable construction of controlled phase gate for two-spin system that can be generalized to multi-qubit systems. For a three-qubit system Z8  ×  8 is given by

[formula]

where Z08  ×  8,Z18  ×  8,Z28  ×  8, and Z38  ×  8 are defined as follows

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

As an important but special case let eiφ000 = eiφ001 = eiφ010 = eiφ100 = 1 and eiφ011 = eiφ101 = eiφ110 = eiφ111 =  - 1. Then, we have following cluster state

[formula]

Note that this state is entangled since e.g., α000α110  ≠  α010α100. This is also a graph state with three nodes connected which is obtained by applying the controlled phased gate CZ three times on node 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3.

Next, as an illustrative and physically implementable example of our construction we will discuss the construction of a two-qubit gate [\cite=Chen]. For example let the Hamiltonian of a two-spin system without transverse field be given by

[formula]

where ωi is the frequency of spin i, J is the coupling coefficient, and σiz is the z projection operator of spin i. Then, we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Thus, the evolution of this two-partite system is give by

[formula]

Now, if we substitute -  ψx1x0t = φx1x0, for all x1,x0 = 0,1, then we recognize our Z2  ×  2 matrix for this two-partite system. This construction can be generalized for multi-qubits systems, where the Hamiltonian acting on a multi-qubit state as follows

[formula]

where [formula] describes a specific multi-qubit system which we have explicitly defined for two-qubit spin systems.

In this paper we have constructed a geometrical controlled phased gate entangler for multi-qunit states based on a generalization of controlled phase gate. The construction is simple and works for any multi-qubit quantum states. In continuation of this work, it would also be interesting to investigate the use of this method for construction of generalized graph states which are building blocks of measurement-based quantum computer models.
