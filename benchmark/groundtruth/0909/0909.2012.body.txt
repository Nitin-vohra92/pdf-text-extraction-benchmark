Three-Dimensional Doppler Tomography of the RS Vulpeculae Interacting Binary

Introduction

The extension from 2D to 3D tomography is now a reality. Two-dimensional Doppler images can be created with the standard Filtered Back Projection (FBP) Method (e.g., [\citealt=kaitchucketal94]) by projecting the sources of emission onto a single central (Vx,Vy) velocity plane. This plane is expected to coincide with the orbital plane of the binary since this is the plane in which the gravitational forces dominate the gas flows. However, these sources may have non-zero velocities beyond the central 2D plane since they are not geometrically thin and are not confined to the orbital plane. Instead, 3D images can be derived over a range of Vz values transverse to the central plane. The resulting 3D maps are consistent with the 2D Doppler tomograms obtained with the FBP method and reveal substantial flow structures beyond the central velocity plane. The 3D reconstruction method applied in this work is the Radioastronomical Approach (RA) developed by [\citet=agafonov04a] [\citet=agafonov04b] [\citet=agafonov+sharova05a] [\citet=agafonov+sharova05b]. A detailed discussion of the differences between this technique and the FBP method can be found in [\citet=agafonovetal06] and [\citet=agafonovetal09]. In particular, the RA method is especially useful when the number of projections is relatively small because it can achieve the same resolution as FBP while using fewer profiles (see Figure 1 of [\citealt=agafonovetal06]). The effectiveness of the RA method has been examined by using initial 3D test models, calculating 1D profiles from these models, and then performing the reconstruction. [\citep=sharova06] compared the computed models with the initial models and showed that the computed emission maxima coincided with the initial model, and all details were reproduced. So, there was very good agreement between the initial test model and the reconstructed 3D tomogram.

The two-dimensional Doppler tomograms of the Algol-type binaries [\citep=richardsetal95] [\citep=albright+richards96] [\citep=richards04] display a diverse range of circumstellar structures. These include a gas stream, accretion annulus, transient accretion disk, shock regions and sometimes a chromospheric emission source in the short-period (P <   5 days) Algols, as well as a classical accretion disk in the long-period (P ≥   5 - 6 days) Algols. [\citet=richards+albright99] found that some systems, like U Coronae Borealis (U CrB) and U Sagittae (U Sge), alternate between streamlike and disklike states and display changes that can occur within a year, and sometimes overnight. They identified RS Vul as a member of this group.

The first applications of the 3D procedure focused on the interacting Algol-type binary U CrB. The 2D tomograms constructed from Hα spectra of this binary collected in 1993 and 1994 displayed two distinct patterns: a transient accretion disk representing the disklike state (in epoch 1993) and a bright gas stream flowing along the predicted ballistic trajectory representing the streamlike state (in epoch 1994). The 3D tomograms of these emission sources were even more distinct than the 2D versions, and both states showed evidence of a prominent emission source associated with the mass gainer, resulting from the impact of the gas stream onto the photosphere of that star [\citep=agafonovetal06] [\citep=agafonovetal09]. Chromospheric emission from the mass loser was also visible especially when the binary was in the disklike state. The 3D image also showed distinct evidence of gas flows (jets) with high Vz velocities. These jets were associated with three emission sources: (1) the impact/splash region where the gas stream strikes the mass gainer in the streamlike state (Vz ~   -300 to +100 km s- 1); (2) the interaction between the gas stream and accretion disk in the disklike state (Vz ~   300 to 400 km s- 1); and (3) the Localized Region where the disk material interacts with the incoming gas stream after traveling around the mass gainer (Vz ~   +200 to +500 km s- 1). These high values are expected since the star-stream impact occurs at speeds of up ~  500-600 km s- 1, compared to the slower rotation of the mass gainer [\citep=richards92] [\citep=blondinetal95] [\citep=richards+ratliff98]. Moreover, the pattern of Vz velocities associated with the disk emission implies that the disk may be inclined to the orbital plane; which subsequently suggests that the rotation axis of the mass gainer could be precessing as a consequence of the star-stream impact. This result would not have been possible from 2D tomograms alone.

In this paper, we have continued our exploration of 3D tomography by studying the RS Vul system. Specifically, we have 1) identified the features in the 3D images and related them to those seen in the 2D tomograms; 2) compared the 3D tomogram of RS Vul with those of U CrB; and 3) provided a physical interpretation of these features. The system parameters and 2D results are described in Section 2, the 3D tomograms are described in Section 3, a model for RS Vul is given in Section 4, and the Conclusions are outlined in Section 5.

2D Doppler Tomography of RS Vul

The Algol-type binary RS Vulpeculae is an interacting system in which the cooler G1 III secondary star is transferring mass to its B5 main-sequence companion (the primary) through Roche lobe overflow. RS Vul is a short-period Algol (Porb = 4.4776635 days; [\citealt=holmgren89]) with an orbital inclination of 78.7[formula] [\citep=hutchings+hill71]. The properties of the system are Mp = 6.59 [formula], Ms = 1.76 [formula], Rp = 4.71 [formula], Rs = 5.84 [formula], systemic velocity Vo= -20.1 km s- 1, velocity semi-amplitude Kp = 54.0 km s- 1, with a mass ratio, q=0.27 [\citep=holmgren89]. Eighty-one Hα (6562.8 Å) spectra with a resolution of 0.166 Å/pixel or 7.6 km s- 1 were collected in 1993 with the KPNO 0.9m Coudé Feed Telescope (see [\citealt=richards+albright99]). The spectra were collected at closely spaced positions around the entire orbit of the binary. Since the observed spectra are dominated by the spectrum of the B5 mass gaining star, model atmospheres calculations were used to represent the photospheric contributions of the stars, and these stellar contributions were subtracted from the observed spectra to create difference spectra (see [\citealt=richards+albright99] for details). The difference spectra were used to calculate the tomograms.

The standard 2D Doppler tomogram of RS Vul 1993 is shown in Figure 1 along with the 2D tomogram of U CrB in the streamlike state (from [\citet=richards01]). These 2D images were compared with the 3D Doppler tomograms based on the same data. In the tomograms, the solid trajectory is the gravitational free-fall path of the gas stream; and the circles along this trajectory are marked at intervals of a tenth of the distance from the L1 point to the distance of closest approach to the mass gainer. The largest solid circle and the smaller dashed circle mark the inner and outer edge of a Keplerian disk, respectively; the asterisk is the predicted location where the gas stream should strike the photosphere of the mass gainer; and the plus sign marks the center of mass of the binary. The RS Vul tomogram shows the presence of the gas stream, a circumprimary emission source, chromospheric emission, and a region dominated by absorption called the absorption zone [\citep=richards01]. The strongest emission source corresponds to the chromospheric Hα emission [\citep=richards+albright96].

3D Doppler Tomography

Reconstruction of the 3D Tomogram

For the reconstruction of the 3D Doppler tomograms, we analyzed the same set of Hα line profiles that were used by [\citet=richards01] to construct the standard 2D Doppler tomogram of RS Vul. The 3D Doppler tomogram was calculated as a set of numerical values in the cells of a cube, with dimensions (Vx,Vy,Vz) having values ranging from -700 to +700 km s- 1. The maximum of this function was normalized to the unit to permit the visualization of the image based on any slice taken from any direction. The velocity resolution of the image depends on the number of projections (i.e., number of spectra) and their distribution in orbital phase; and the orbital inclination influences the ratio of the resolutions in the Vx, Vy, and Vz directions. The wavelength resolution of the spectra is 7.6 km s- 1, so it plays a smaller role in setting the resolution of the image since it is already sufficient to produce the best possible velocity resolution for the tomogram. In particular, the velocity resolutions in the (Vx,Vy), (Vz,Vx), or (Vz,Vy) planes are equal only for an inclination of 45[formula]; and the resolutions in the Vx and Vy directions are better than that in the Vz direction for high values of inclination. Since the orbital inclination of RS Vul is high (i = 78.7[formula]), the 3D tomogram was restored with a resolution of 30 km s- 1 in the Vx and Vy directions and 105 km s- 1 in Vz direction. Since the resolution in the Vz direction is approximately 3.5 times lower than in the other directions, features on the tomogram may look elongated in this direction. The appearance of the images has been simplified by displaying the (Vx,Vy) slices in the horizontal plane to be consistent with the direction of the orbital plane of the binary, and the slices containing the Vz axis are in the vertical direction.

A direct comparison was made between the observed spectra and those computed from the reconstructed 3D Doppler tomograms. Figure 2 shows this match for the 3D Doppler tomograms of RS Vul. The radial velocity, Vr is plotted versus orbital phase, with a resolution of 30 km s- 1. The observed spectra are displayed in the left frames and the spectra computed from the 3D Doppler tomograms are displayed in the middle frames. Two S-wave patterns are noticeable in the observed and computed spectra corresponding to the motions of the two stars. The overall agreement between the observed and computed spectra is very good. The quality of the fit is shown in the right frame of Figure 2, which displays the relative chi-square statistic, χ2  /  χ2c, versus orbital phase. Here, χ2 is normalized to the critical value of χ2c, which corresponds to the largest acceptable value of χ2 at the 99% confidence level (e.g., [\citealt=skilling+bryan84]). Figure 2 shows that χ2 was less than 20% of the critical value at most orbital phases and it was only as high as 65% of the critical value over a narrow phase range from 0.47 to 0.49, perhaps because the 3D code assumes that the gas is optically thin when it might be optically thick at these phases. So, in all cases, χ2 was much lower than the critical value which confirms that the 3D reconstruction has produced a reliable computed model for RS Vul.

Description and Interpretation of Emission Features

RS Vul and U CrB have similar geometries, so we expect to identify similar features in their Doppler images. Figure 3 displays 20 slices in the (Vx,Vy) plane for values of Vz ranging from - 540 km s- 1 to + 540 km s- 1, in 60 km s- 1 steps. The superposition of the color or gray-scale images with the contour images allows us to emphasize the main features in each Vz slice of the 3D image. Figure 4 displays the images of seven representative Vz slices over the range from Vz = - 480 km s- 1 to + 480 km s- 1. A similar figure for U CrB in the streamlike state is shown in Figure 5 for comparison. Figure 6 displays several cross-sections of the flow in the (Vy,Vz) plane. In Figures 3 - 6, the light (yellow) areas with blue contours represent absorption while the dark (deep pink) areas with red contours represent emission.

[\citet=agafonovetal09] identified several features in the 3D tomogram of U CrB that were consistent with those found in the 2D image studied by [\citet=richards01]: (1) circumprimary emission (centered on the mass gainer) and an accretion annulus (a circular region of low velocity); (2) chromospheric emission from the cool donor star (the secondary); (3) the gas stream flowing along its predicted ballistic trajectory; (4) the star-stream impact region, where the gas stream strikes the stellar surface; (5) emission within the predicted locus of the accretion disk; (6) a localized region between the stars where the gas stream strikes material that has circled the mass gainer; (7) a second localized region where the gas stream makes impact with the outer edge of the accretion disk; (8) a jet or flare associated with the chromosphere of the secondary star; and (9) a high-velocity stream or jet extending in the Vz-direction beyond the stream-star impact region.

The 3D image of RS Vul displays all of the emission sources found in U CrB (see Figs. 3 and 4), except that there was almost no emission from an accretion disk and little evidence of the star-stream impact region. Figure 3 shows that the strongest emission sources are associated with the cool mass loser as well as the mass gainer. The emission sources are described in Table 1 along with their typical velocity ranges and a brief description of each feature is provided below.

1. The circumprimary emission centered on the velocity of the mass gainer in RS Vul is labeled (1) in Figure 4. It is the strongest source of emission in the 3D image (see Figure 3, slice at Vz = - 160 km s- 1). This feature can be seen in the slices with Vz velocities from 0 to -320 km s- 1 in Figures 3 and 6 (see also Table 1). Moreover, it is distinctly different from the same feature seen in U CrB 1993, which displayed a symmetric Vz distribution from Vz = - 180 to + 180 km s- 1 (see Table 1 in [\citealt=agafonovetal09]). The circumprimary emission has higher velocities than expected from synchronous rotation, so the star may have been spun up by the impact of the gas from the donor star.

2. Chromospheric emission from the cool mass losing star is feature (2) and it is comparable in strength to the circumprimary emission. It is associated with a wide range of Vz velocities from - 530 to + 350 km s- 1 (see Figures 3, 4, 6, and Table 1). This range is illustrated in Figure 6 and resembles a jet-like feature in the Vz direction. The feature has the same velocity as the mass losing star.

3. The gas stream flowing along its predicted ballistic trajectory is feature (3). It flows from the L1 point towards the mass gaining star with speeds up to 450 km s- 1 in the (Vx,Vy) plane, with a Vz velocity of - 300 km s- 1. RS Vul is unusual because the flow along the gas stream is not strongest in the Vz = 0 km s- 1 frame but in the Vz = -240 to -360 km s- 1 range (see Figs. 3 and 4). This is distinctly different from U CrB in its streamlike state (Fig. 5), in which the gas stream flow was strongest in the central velocity plane (Vz = 0 km s- 1) and located directly on the predicted trajectory of the gas stream in the (Vx,Vy) plane. This is not the case for RS Vul.

4. The predicted location of the star-stream impact region, where the gas stream strikes the stellar surface, is found at (4) near the location where the gas stream trajectory intersects the inner part of the disk. Even in its most extended state (when it is at Vz = -300 km s- 1), the gas stream (Feature 3) never gets to this predicted velocity, but is truncated at the velocity corresponding to that of Keplerian flow at the surface of the mass gainer.

5. There is very little evidence of any emission within the predicted locus of the accretion disk (Feature 5) in the RS Vul images, although some clumping is seen within this region. This feature was much stronger in U CrB, and there is slightly more space around the mass gainer in U CrB to form a disk. However, gas may have traveled around the mass gainer and created the localized regions (described below) when the interaction with the stream slowed the gas flow.

6. A Localized region (LR) between the stars labeled (6) was found near the center of the tomogram where the flow around the mass gainer is expected to strike the inner edge of incoming gas stream (see Cartesian models of β Per [\citep=richards92] [\citep=richards93], RW Tau [\citep=vesper+honeycutt93], and other direct-impact systems). In RS Vul, this region is detected at high positive Vz velocities ranging from + 50 to + 300 km s- 1 and seems to develop into the structure seen at the L1 point from Vz = + 360 to 540 km s- 1 (Fig. 3). The classical localized region between the stars is seen along the Vx=0 km s- 1 line for Vz velocities from 50 to 540 km s- 1 in Figure 3. However, it is difficult to say whether the part with L1 point velocities in the (Vx,Vy) plane for Vz = + 180 to + 300 km s- 1 (Fig. 4) should be considered part of the cool star or part of the LR. This feature is also seen in Figure 6 slices for Vx = - 20 to + 20 km s- 1. This kind of braking was first suggested by Richards (1992) in the study of the Algol-type binary β Persei and confirmed using hydrodynamic simulations of [\citet=blondinetal95] and [\citet=richards+ratliff98]. Similar results were found later from gas dynamical modeling of cataclysmic variables by [\citet=kuznetsovetal01], [\citet=bisikaloetal00a], and [\citet=bisikaloetal00b].

7. A second compact region labeled (7) also has high Vz velocities from 0 to 350 km s- 1 and is located on the Vy = 0 km s- 1 line (see Figures 3 and 4). In Figure 6, it can be seen in the Vx = 100 to 120 km s- 1 frames, with an average Vz velocity of about 250 km s- 1. This feature may later merge with the other localized region that runs along the line of centers between the stars.

8. The feature labeled (8) has a velocity similar to the Vx and Vy velocities of the donor star, but with high positive Vz velocities in the range from Vz=+ 180 to + 540 km s- 1 (see Figures 3 and 4). It has Vx and Vy velocities of 100 to 300 km s- 1 (see Figs. 3, 4, and 6). This feature could be the result of chromospheric emission on the cool mass loser, and the high velocities suggest that it could correspond to a jet or flare. However, another explanation is that it is related to the interaction between the inner edge of the gas stream and the material that has circled the mass gainer. A similar emission source was found in U CrB.

9. The absorption feature in RS Vul seen in the lower left and right quadrants of Figure 3 from Vz = -120 to +540 km s- 1 was called the absorption zone by [\citet=richards01] [\citet=richards04], and is associated with the locus where the gas temperature becomes too high to emit at Hα. A structure at a similar location was identified in the ultraviolet tomogram of U Sge by [\citet=kempner+richards99] and in the Hα tomogram of U CrB by [\citet=agafonovetal09].

The 3D tomograms also reveal an interesting symmetry in the emission sources found in the Vz slices. A strong source near the mass losing star (in velocity space) is detected with intensities of 0.852 and 0.955 in symmetrical locations at Vz = - 300 and + 300 km s- 1, respectively (see Figure 4). A similar symmetric intensity pattern (I = 0.343 and 0.333) is seen at Vz = - 480 and + 480 km s- 1. In the case of the mass gaining star, another symmetric pattern is revealed. The most intense emission feature in the Vz = 180 km s- 1 frame in Figure 4, with I=0.612, is located along the Vx = 0 km s- 1 line at Vy = + 80 km s- 1, in the opposite Vy direction from the circumprimary emission. These symmetries may be purely coincidental or perhaps we can see the same feature with motions on both sides relative to the central velocity plane, with a - Vz component in - z direction and with a + Vz component in + z direction. Nevertheless, it is expected that the gas flows should be symmetric about the central velocity plane if gravitational forces dominate the gas flows. So, the displacements of emission features (1), (2), and (3) from the central velocity plane should not be unusual.

A Model for RS Vul

Figure 7 displays the 3D tomograms of RS Vul and U CrB in a 3D velocity cube together with the 2D integral images for the main planes: (Vx,Vy), (Vx,Vz), and (Vy,Vz). These 2D integral images represent the integrals along the Vz, Vy, and Vx directions, respectively; and the image in the (Vx,Vy) plane is equivalent to the 2D Doppler tomogram. The U CrB images in this figure are derived from the combined disk and stream states of that system. The 3D velocity cube of RS Vul illustrates that RS Vul has no gas stream emission along the predicted trajectory in its central velocity plane, although the 2D integral image in the (Vx,Vy) plane shows that the gas stream emission is indeed prominent, but at Vz velocities much higher than expected. In addition, both binaries display a gas velocity distribution that is inclined to the vertical direction (Vx = 0 km s- 1) in the 2D integral (Vx,Vz) plane, but vertical in the 2D integral (Vy,Vz) plane.

A pattern has emerged from the study of the 3D tomogram of RS Vul. Both the circumprimary emission source labeled earlier as (1) and the gas stream (3) were offset toward negative Vz velocities, while the chromospheric emission (2) had Vz velocities over the range from - 530 to + 350 km s- 1 (see also Figure 6). So, the circumprimary emission was strong over the same range of Vz velocities corresponding to the strongest gas stream emission. Moreover, the gas stream emission extended to the Keplerian velocity at the photosphere of the mass gainer, while the mass gainer was spinning faster than the synchronous value. Therefore, the results are consistent with the assumption that the circumprimary emission (from a photospheric bulge) is produced when the gas stream strikes the surface of the star. In addition, the mostly negative Vz velocities for the gas stream and the circumprimary emission suggest that the gas does not move in the central velocity plane, as expected if gravitational forces dominate the gas flows, and so the flow around the mass gainer is concentrated on one side of the central velocity plane.

While the image reconstruction process can now produce 3D velocity images, we are still unable to create the desired 2D or 3D Cartesian images because the various emission features have different velocity fields. However, an estimate of the gas stream flow can be made from information provided in Figure 1. Based on the point where the gas stream is truncated, we can produce a Cartesian model to show the dominant emission sources in RS Vul. The distance from the L1 point to the center of the primary star has been divided into 10 equal segments in the center frame of Figure 1, and the similar small circles on the Doppler tomograms are marked at velocity intervals corresponding to those distance intervals. Comparing the center and right frames of Figure 1, we see that the gas stream flow is truncated after traveling 7 small circles on the gas stream trajectory, which is equivalent to 70% of the distance from the L1 point to the center of the primary star. The star-stream interaction occurs along the path of the gas stream right where the gas stream ends (at 70% of the distance from the L1 point). Both Figures 3 and 4 show that the gas flow reaches the stellar surface corresponding to the solid circle in the tomogram, which corresponds to the Keplerian velocity at the surface of the mass gainer. Beyond this point, there is no evidence of any significant disk in this binary at this epoch.

Evidence of circumstellar gas distributed well above and below the orbital plane of the binary has been derived from studies of ultraviolet resonance lines and the Hα line of several Algol systems (e.g., Peters and Polidan 1984, Richards 1993). This gas can reach heights comparable to the radius of the mass gaining star. However, semi-analytical ballistic studies (e.g., Lubow and Shu 1975, 1976) or hydrodynamic simulations of the mass transfer process (e.g., [\citealt=richards+ratliff98]) assume that the gas should be found very close to the orbital plane, if magnetic fields are not involved. However, [\citet=sternetal92] suggested that coronal mass ejections could account for more than 10% of the mass transfer expected solely from Roche lobe overflow by gravitational processes alone. The coronal behavior of the cool stars in Algol binaries is enhanced because these stars rotate more rapidly than the slowly rotating Sun. If we can scale the solar coronal behavior to the enhanced levels seen in many Algol binaries, then radio and X-ray flares detected from these systems can be interpreted as the periodic reconnection of the coronal field [\citep=sternetal92]. RS Vul was detected as an X-ray source by [\citet=white+marshall83] with an X-ray luminosity, Lx  =  2.0  ×  1030 erg s- 1, which is about half of the x-ray luminosity of β Per. Radio emission from RS Vul was also detected by [\citet=umanaetal98] with a flux density of 0.26 mJy and radio luminosity, Lradio  =  3.7  ×  1016 ergs cm- 2 s- 1 Hz- 1, compared to 0.30 mJy and 9.1  ×  1016 ergs cm- 2 s- 1 Hz- 1 for U CrB. So, the magnetic fields of the active stars in RS Vul and U CrB should be comparable.

The long-term radio flare survey of the prototype Algol system β Per by [\citet=richardsetal03] demonstrated that major flares (up to 1Jy) occur regularly and predictably every 48.9 ±   1.7 days (or 17 orbital cycles), thus the flaring rate is at least 7.5 yr- 1 and could be as high as 100 yr- 1 (for weaker flares every orbit). Mass ejections from X-ray flares observed with EXOSAT and GINGA are estimated to be ≃ 5 - 50 ×  10- 15 [formula] [\citep=sternetal92], and a total mass ejection rate of ≃ 3.75 - 37.5 ×  10- 14 [formula] yr- 1 would correspond to the detected flaring rate of 7.5 yr- 1 for β Per. These arguments suggest that coronal mass ejections may influence the transfer of gas between stars and even the angle at which the flow is directed. The differences between the gas distributions in RS Vul and U CrB cannot be readily explained by differences in magnetic activity based on their x-ray and radio luminosities. However, it is evident that magnetic fields may play a role in the distribution of circumstellar gas in both systems.

Conclusions

Three-dimensional Doppler tomography has been used to study the Hα emission sources in the RS Vulpeculae interacting binary and has led once again to the discovery of gas flows with significant Vz velocities. The 2D tomogram of this binary suggested that most of the emission arose from the cool mass losing star with additional evidence of gas flowing close to the predicted trajectory. However, the 3D tomogram revealed surprising evidence that a more pronounced flow of gas along the stream was not found as expected in the central velocity plane (Vz = 0 km s- 1) but at Vz velocities from -240 to -360 km s- 1. Magnetic activity on the cool mass losing star may explain the deflection of the gas stream flow away from the orbital plane of the binary where the gravitational forces dominate the interactions between the stars. This flow behavior is distinctly different from that found in the streamlike state of U CrB, in which the gas flow was confined mostly to the central velocity plane. Exploration of the 3D velocity structures of other binary systems should improve our understanding of these out-of-plane gas motions.
