Mittag-Leffler's function, Vekua transform and an inverse obstacle scattering problem

Introduction

This paper is concerned with developing an explicit analytical method for so-called inverse obstacle scattering problems at a fixed wave number. For the purpose we consider an inverse obstacle scattering problem in two dimensions in which the governing equation is given by the Helmholtz equation. The problem is to extract information about the location and shape of unknown sound-hard obstacles D embedded in a medium with constant acoustic speed and density, from the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of the reflected wave w at infinity which is caused by an incident plane wave eikx  ·  d for infinitely many incident directions d∈S1 and a fixed wave number k > 0. This is a prototype of several inverse obstacle scattering problems of acoustic wave.

More precisely we assume that: [formula] is open and [formula] is connected; ∂D is Lipschitz. The reflected wave w is the unique solution of the scattering problem:

[formula]

where ν is the unit outward normal relative to ∂D and r = |x|. This last condition is called the Sommerfeld radiation condition.

It is well known that given φ∈S1 the value w(rφ) as r  →    ∞   has the following form:

[formula]

The coefficient FD(φ;d,k) is called the far field pattern of w.

The operator F:L2(S1)  →  L2(S1) given by the formula

[formula]

is called the far field operator. It is welll known that the far field operator for a fixed k uniquelly dertmines the obstacles [\cite=KK]. In this paper we consider: how to extract information about the location and shape of D from the far field operator or its partial knowledge at fixed k.

In [\cite=Ik2] [\cite=Ik3] the author established the reconstruction formula of D itself from the far field operator. The formula consists of two parts: a relationship between a suitable Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the boundary of a domain that contains [formula] and the far field operator; application of the probe method introduced by the author [\cite=Ik1] to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.

In [\cite=P2] Potthast gave a reconstruction procedure that he calls the singular sources method. The method yielded a way from the far field operator to a scattered field outside unknown obstacles which was exerted by a point source outside the obstacles and blows up on the boundary of the obstacles.

Kirsch gave two types of reconstruction formulae of D in [\cite=K] [\cite=K2]. The idea behind the formulae is called the factorization method since the formulae are based on a factorization formula of the far field operator. In particular, in [\cite=K2] he made use of the quadratic form

[formula]

acting on densities g∈L2(S1) to introduce his indicator function. It is defined by

[formula]

where Φx(φ) = e- ikx  ·  φ,    φ∈S1. He established the one line formula

[formula]

For applications of his method to obstacles with other boundary conditions see [\cite=G] [\cite=GK].

In [\cite=Ik4] in three dimensions the author gave an extraction formula of the convex hull of D with a constraint on the Gaussian curvature of ∂D from a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map calculated from the far field operator. See also [\cite=Ik6] for the sound-soft obstacles. It is an application of the enclosure method introduced by the author [\cite=Ik6] and based on the asymptotic behaviour of the function

[formula]

having large parameter τ where both ϑ and [formula] are unit vectors and perpendicular to each other. This function satisfies the Helmholtz equation [formula] in the whole space and divides the whole space into two parts: if x  ·  ϑ > t, then e-  τt|v|  →    ∞   as τ  →    ∞  ; if x  ·  ϑ < t, then e-  τt|v|  →  0 as τ  →    ∞  . The indicator function introduced in [\cite=Ik4] tells us whether given t the half space x  ·  ϑ > t touches unknown obstacles.

The aim of this paper is to generalize this result by introducing another indicator function which is given by the form (FDg,g) acting on explicit densities g on S1 and tells us whether a given cone touches unknown obstacles.

Statement of the main result and a corollary

In this paper we identify the point ϑ = (ϑ1,ϑ2)∈S1 with the complex number ϑ1 + iϑ2 and denote it by the same symbol ϑ.

Definition 1.1. Given n  ≥  1, [formula], s > 0 and (y,ω)∈BR  ×  S1 define the indicator function

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let 0 < α  ≤  1. Let Cy(ω,πα / 2) denote the interior of the cone about ω of opening angle πα / 2 with vertex at y:

[formula]

The following theorem is the main result of this paper.

Theorem 1.1. Let k2 be not a Neumann eigenvalue of [formula] in D. Assume that ∂D is C2 and that [formula] is contained in the open disc BR radius R centered at the origin. Let γ0 be the unique positive solution of the equation [formula]. Let γ satisfy 0 < γ  <  γ0. Let n  ≥  1. Let [formula] be an arbitrary sequence of positive numbers satisfying, as N  →    ∞

[formula]

Then, given (y,ω)∈BR  ×  S1 we have:

if [formula], then lim N  →    ∞|I1 / n(y,  ω)(s(N))N| = 0;

if [formula], then lim N  →    ∞|I1 / n(y,  ω)(s(N))N|  =    ∞  .

Theorem 1.1 is a direct consequence of two lemmas below.

Lemma 1.1. There exists a positive constant C such that, for all g∈L2(S1)

[formula]

where

[formula]

and is called the Herglotz wave function with the density g.

Lemma 1.2. Given (y,ω)∈BR  ×  S1 we have:

if [formula], then lim N  →    ∞||Hg1 / n(y,  ω)(    ·    ;s(N),k,ω)N||H1(D) = 0;

if [formula], then lim N  →    ∞||Hg1 / n(y,  ω)(    ·    ;s(N),k,ω)N|∂D||L2(∂D)  =    ∞  .

Lemma 1.1 has been pointed out in [\cite=G]. It is a corollary of a factorization formula in [\cite=K] and a coerciveness of an operator in the formula. A known proof of the coerciveness is given by a contradiction argument (cf. Lemma 4.2 in [\cite=GK]) and therefore not direct. It seems that at the present time, there is no direct proof of this fact.

Lemma 1.2 follows from Corollary 2.1 and (3.16) in Sections 2 and 3, respectively.

So from Theorem 1.1 what information about unknown obstacles was extracted? To answer precisely we formulate the visible part of [formula].

Definition 1.2. We say that a point y in [formula] is visible if the point y can be connected with infinity by a straight line that started at y and goes to infinity without intersecting [formula]. We denote by [formula] the set of all points in [formula] that are visible. We call this set the visible part of [formula].

It is easy to see that the point y in [formula] belongs to the visible part of [formula] if and only if there exist n and ω  ∈  S1 such that [formula] with α = 1 / n. The set [formula] is a non empty open set of [formula]. If D is convex, then we have [formula] by a separation theorem. Needless to say, in general this is not true, however, the complement of the visible part of [formula] gives an estimation of [formula] from above.

The next theorem tells us that the asymptotic behaviour of the indicator function I1 / n(y,  ω)(s(N))N as N  →    ∞   for all n and (y,  ω)∈  BR    ×  S1 uniquely determines the visible part of [formula] except for a thin set.

Corollary 1.1. Let D1 and D2 be two obstacles such that: k2 be not a Neumann eigenvalue of [formula] in Dj; ∂Dj is C2 and that [formula] is contained in the open disc BR radius R centered at the origin. Assume that, for each fixed n and (y,ω)∈  BR  ×    S1 we have

[formula]

Then [formula].

This is derived from Theorem 1.1 as follows. It suffices to prove [formula]. Let [formula]. Then there exist n and ω  ∈  S1 such that [formula] with α = 1 / n. By Theorem 1.1 we have

[formula]

Since y does not belong to ∂D2, it belongs to D2 or [formula]. If y∈  D2, then from Theorem 1.1 one has

[formula]

A combination of this and assumption gives

[formula]

This is a contradiction. So y has to be in the set [formula]. If [formula], then, from Theorem 1.1 we again obtain (1.2) and the same contradiction as above. Thus [formula]. Therefore if one chooses a larger n' than n, then one gets [formula] with α' = 1 / n'. This means that [formula].

A brief explanation of the idea

Here we give a brief explanation of the origin of the density g1 / n(y,  ω)(    ·    ;s,k)N.

Finding the density is closely related to Mittag-Leffler's function Eα(z) which is an entire function and defined by the formula

[formula]

where α is a parameter and satisfies 0 < α  ≤  1. The function Eα(τ(x1 + ix2)) of independent variables x = (x1,x2) with parameter 0 < τ  <    ∞   is harmonic in the whole plane. This function divides the whole plane into two parts as τ  →    ∞  : in a sector it is exponentially growing; outside the sector decaying algebraically. In [\cite=Ik3] we applied this property of the harmonic function to an inverse boundary value problem for an elliptic equation [formula] with a discontinues coefficient γ which is a special, however, very important version of the Calderón problem [\cite=C] and a continuum model of electrical impedance tomography.

In Section 2 we modify this harmonic function by using the Vekua transform [\cite=V] [\cite=V2](see also [\cite=BG] [\cite=CD]) which transforms given solution of the Laplace equation in [formula] into that of the Helmholtz equation [formula] in [formula]. Using the solution obtained by the transform, we define a special solution with a large parameter s > 0 of the Helmholtz equation which is denoted by Eα(x;s,k,ω). In particular, the function [formula] is the Vekua transform of the harmonic function

[formula]

where ω = (ω1,ω2)  ∈S1. We show that the function Eα(x;s,k,ω) has the asymptotic behaviour as s  →    ∞   similar to that of the original Mittag-Leffler's function:

if x∈C0(ω,πα / 2), then lim s  →    ∞|Eα(x;s,k,ω)|  =    ∞  ;

if [formula], then lim s  →    ∞|Eα(x;s,k,ω)| = 0.

In Section 3 we establish the relationship between the density g1 / n(y,  ω)(    ·    ;s,k)N and the function Eα(x - y;s,k,ω) for α = 1 / n and [formula]:

[formula]

as N  →    ∞  . Thus one can say that g1 / n(y,  ω)(    ·    ;s,k)N and s(N) are chosen in such a way that the corresponding Herglotz wave function approximates a modification of Mittag-Leffler's function.

It should be pointed out that the result in [\cite=Ik11] is closely related to the construction of the density. Therein the author considered the case when D is polygonal. This means that D has the expression [formula] with 1  ≤  m <   ∞   where [formula] are simply connected open sets, polygons and satisfy [formula] for [formula].

The observation data are given by FD(    ·    ;d,k) for fixed d and k provided we know the disc BR that contains [formula]. Using the enclosure method [\cite=Ik7], we established a direct extraction formula of the convex hull of D from the quantity

[formula]

for some explicit densities g independent of D. The one of key points is the choice of the densities. Those are chosen in such a way that

[formula]

where [formula]. However, to get more than convex hull of unknown obstacles the function in the right hand side is not enough. In this paper we give explicitly the desired function by using the idea of the Vekua transform and Mittag-Leffler's function.

Finally we point out that there are other approaches with a single incident plane wave: the point source method [\cite=P], the no response test [\cite=LP], the range test [\cite=PSK] and the notion of the scattering support [\cite=KS].

Modified Mittag-Leffler's function

In this section we introduce a modification of Eα(τ(x1 + ix2)) with 0 < τ  <    ∞   that satisfies the Helmholtz equation [formula] in [formula] and study its asymptotic behaviour as τ  →    ∞  .

The Bessel function of order [formula] is given by the formula

[formula]

Definition 2.1. Let k  ≥  0 and 0 < α  ≤  1. Define

[formula]

Using the well known inequality (see Ex. 9.6, p.59 of [\cite=O])

[formula]

one knows that Ekα(x;τ) is well defined and satisfies [formula].

The idea behind Definition 2.1 is the following. Let x = (r cos θ,  r sin θ). One has

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, by replacing rm in the expansion of Eα(τ(x1 + ix2)) with (2 / k)mm!Jm(kr) one obtains Ekα(x;τ). From (2.1) one knows that the absolute value of (2 / k)mm!Jm(kr) is not greater than rm and

[formula]

as r  →  0. In particular, we have Ekα(0;τ) = 1.

Using the change of variables [formula] and the formula

[formula]

one can see that the function Ekα(x;τ) has the integral representation given by the formula

[formula]

The integral transform

[formula]

is called the Vekua transform of the function v(x) into the function u(x). This transforms given solution of the Laplace equation in [formula] into that of the Helmholtz equation [formula] in [formula]. The formula (2.2) says that Ekα(x;τ) is the Vekua transform of Eα(τ(x1 + ix2)) and therefore satisfies the Helmholtz equation.

In this section we show that Ekα(x;τ) as τ  →    ∞   has the almost same asymptotic behaviour as Eα(τ(x1 + ix2)).

In this paper, for convenience we introduce

[formula]

From (2.1) we have |Ĵm(t)|  ≤  1. In what follows we make use of this inequality frequently.

Let f(z) be an arbitrary entire function of independent variable z = x1 + ix2. Let u(x;τ) denote the Vekua transform of f(τ(x1 + ix2)). u(x;τ) takes the form

[formula]

In this section we write [formula].

The following is useful for the treatment of Ekα(x;τ) outside the cone C(πα / 2). See Appendix for the proof.

Lemma 2.1. One can write u(x;τ) and the partial derivatives as:

[formula]

where R(x;τ) satisfies

[formula]

[formula]

where Rj(x;τ) satisfies

[formula]

Let us consider the case when x is outside cone C(πα / 2). It is known that, as |x|  →    ∞   and [formula] Mittag-Leffler's function and the partial derivatives have the asymptotic form (see [\cite=B] [\cite=E] [\cite=Ik9]):

[formula]

and

[formula]

These asymptotics are valid uniformly in the region [formula] for given π  -  πα / 2 > ε > 0 and some R0 >  > 1.

Proposition 2.1. Let [formula]. We have, as τ  →    ∞

[formula]

and

[formula]

These asymptotics are valid uniformly in the region [formula] for given π  -  πα / 2 > ε > 0 and R > 0.

Proof. From (2.8) and (2.9) we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then applying Lemma 2.1 to the case when f(z) = Eα(z), from (2.4), (2.5), (2.12) and (2.13), we obtain (2.10). Next from (2.6), (2.7), (2.8), (2.9), (2.13) and (2.14), we have

[formula]

Then from the equation

[formula]

and (2.12) one obtains (2.11).

[formula]

Next consider the case when x is inside the cone Cy(πα / 2). From (2.2) we have the expression

[formula]

and a direct computation yields

[formula]

It is known that there exists a positive constant C such that, for all [formula] the estimates

[formula]

and

[formula]

are valid (see [\cite=E] [\cite=Ik9]). Note that in (2.18) there is no restriction on z in a neighbourhood of 0. This is because of 0 < α  ≤  1.

Proposition 2.2. Given R > 0 and ε > 0 let x satisfy R- 1  ≤  |x|  ≤  R and   (x1 + ix2)1 / α  ≥  ε. Then, as τ  →    ∞   we have two formulae:

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. Since (2.19) is a direct consequence of (2.15), (2.17) and the estimate

[formula]

first we give the proof of (2.21).

Write

[formula]

Then, from (2.17) we have

[formula]

provided R- 1  ≤  |x|  ≤  R.

Let 0 < δ < 1. Write

[formula]

Then, one has

[formula]

Write

[formula]

Change of a variable 1 - t1 / α = s yields

[formula]

and this gives

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

From (2.23), (2.24) and (2.25) one concludes that

[formula]

provided   (x1 + ix2)1 / α  ≥  ε. A combination of (2.22) and (2.26) yields (2.21).

Next we prove: for m = 0,1

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Now from (2.18) and (2.28) one obtains (2.27). Similarly, for j = 1,2 we have

[formula]

provided   (x1 + ix2)1 / α  ≥  ε and R- 1  ≤  |x|  ≤  R. Note that this is a 'rough' estimate. Now from (2.16), (2.18), (2.28) and (2.29) we obtain (2.20).

[formula]

As a corollary of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2 we have immediately

Corollary 2.1. We have:

for any regular C2 curve c with [formula]

[formula]

for any non empty bounded open set U of [formula] with [formula]

[formula]

Construction of the density

Definition 3.1. Given ω = (ω1,  ω2)  ∈S1 set [formula]. Define the function E1 / n(x;s,k,ω) by the formula

[formula]

From (2.2) we have already known that the function E1 / n(x;s,k,ω) of [formula] satisfies the Helmholtz equation [formula] in [formula]. Since [formula], the function E1 / n(x;s,k,ω) coincides with the Vekua transform of the harmonic function [formula] in [formula].

The aim of this section is to construct a density g∈L2(S1) explicitly such that

[formula]

The starting point is the following fact.

Proposition 3.1([\cite=Ik11]). The Vekua transform of the harmonic function

[formula]

coincides with eikx  ·  φ.

Let Γ be a non empty open subset of S1. Given g∈L2(S1) the function

[formula]

is harmonic in the whole plane. As a corollary of Proposition 3.1 one knows that the Vekua transform of this harmonic function coincides with the Herglotz wave function Hg.

Taking account the fact mentioned above and the definition of E1 / n(x;s,k,ω), it suffices to construct g in such a way that

[formula]

where [formula].

Using the power series expansion of Mittag-Leffler's function, one knows that if g satisfies the system of equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

then g satisfies (3.1) exactly. Now consider the case when Γ = S1. We construct g in the form

[formula]

Since

[formula]

from (3.2) and (3.3) we get [formula] and

[formula]

Then g becomes

[formula]

This is always divergent. So we consider a truncation of (3.4):

[formula]

where [formula]. Then one obtains

[formula]

This shows gN(    ·    ;s,k,ω) satisfies (3.1) in this sense. Taking the Vekua transform of the both sides of (3.6) we obtain the equation

[formula]

where x = (r cos   θ,r sin   θ). Note that this can be checked also directly and the equation HgN(    ·    ;s,k,ω)(0) = E1 / n(0;s,k,ω) = 1 holds.

For our purpose we have to consider how to choose s depending on N. One answer to this question is the following and it is the main result of this section.

Theorem 3.1. Let γ0 be the unique positive solution of the equation [formula]. Let γ satisfy 0 < γ  <  γ0. Let [formula] be an arbitrary sequence of positive numbers satisfying, as N  →    ∞

[formula]

Then we have, as N  →    ∞

[formula]

Proof. Set

[formula]

Then from (2.1) we have, for all x with |x|  ≤  2R

[formula]

Moreover, using the recurrence relation

[formula]

one has the formulae

[formula]

Then the formulae

[formula]

give the estimate

[formula]

From the proof of Proposition 3.2 in [\cite=IS2] one has

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that these are sharper than (3.5) and (3.6) of Proposition 3.2 in [\cite=IS2]. Consider the case when z = Rs(N). Then we get, as N  →    ∞

[formula]

Since

[formula]

from (3.9), (3.10) and (3.11) to (3.13) we obtain

[formula]

Using the Stirling formula, we have

[formula]

where [formula] is an arbitrary sequence of positive numbers satisfying, as N  →    ∞   [formula] and 0 < γ  <  γ0. Now the conclusion follows from (3.7), (3.14) and (3.15).

[formula]

From (3.5) we know that g1 / n(y,  ω)(    ·    ;s,k)N given by (1.1) has the expression

[formula]

Then from Definition 3.1, (3.8) and the equation Hg1 / n(y,ω)(    ·    ;s,k)N(x) = HgN(    ·    ;s,k,ω)(x - y), we immediately obtain

Corollary 3.1. Let [formula] be same as in Theorem 3.1. Then for any fixed (y,ω)∈BR  ×  S1 we have, as N  →    ∞

[formula]

Remarks

Remark 4.1. It should be pointed out that the density (1.1) satisfies

[formula]

Therefore we obtain the relationship between our indicator function and Kirsch's one:

[formula]

This together with Theorem 1.1 explains why K(x) = 0 in a case that the point x can be connected with infinity by a straight line without intersecting [formula]. Note that, if x∈  D, then 0 < K(x) <   ∞  , however, from Theorem 1.1 we know that, for all ω∈  S1 lim N  →    ∞|I1 / n(x,  ω)(s(N))N|  =    ∞  .

Remark 4.2. Theorem 1.1 does not cover the 'critical' case when both [formula] and [formula] are satisfied. This is coming from a lack of a necessary uniform estimate of the function Eα(x;s,k,ω). At the present time we do not know what one can say about the behaviour of the indicator function as N  →    ∞   in this case. Note that the results in [\cite=Ik9] and Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=IS2] completely cover this type case.
