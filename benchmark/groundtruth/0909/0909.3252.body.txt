Introduction

The Reconstruction Conjecture of Ulam and Kelley famously states that the isomorphism class of all graphs graphs on three or more vertices is determined by the isomorphism classes of its vertex-deleted subgraphs (see [\cite=MR0252258] for a survey of classic results on this problem). A frequent issue when attacking reconstruction problems is that automorphisms of the substructures lead to ambiguity when producing the larger structure.

This paper considers the relation between the automorphism group of a graph and the automorphism groups of the vertex-deleted subgraphs and edge-deleted subgraphs. If a group Γ1 is the automorphism group of a graph G, and another group Γ2 is the automorphism group of G - v for some vertex v, then we say Γ1 deletes to Γ2. This relation is denoted Γ1  →  Γ2. A corresponding definition for edge deletions is also developed. Our main result is that any two groups delete to each other, with vertices or edges.

These relations also appear in McKay's isomorph-free generation algorithm [\cite=MR1606516], which is frequently used to enumerate all graph isomorphism classes. After generating a graph G of order n, graphs of order n + 1 are created by adding vertices and considering each G + v. To prune the search tree, the canonical labeling of G + v is computed, usually by nauty, McKay's canonical labeling algorithm [\cite=nauty] [\cite=HRnauty]. Finding a canonical labeling of a graph reveals its automorphism group. Since G was generated by this process, its automorphism group is known but is not used while computing the automorphism group of G + v. If some groups could not delete to the automorphism group of G, then they certainly cannot appear as the automorphism group of G + v which may allow for some improvement to the canonical labeling algorithm. The current lack of such optimizations hints that no such restrictions exist, but this notion has not been formalized before this paper.

One reason why this problem has not been answered is that the study of graph symmetry is very restricted, mostly to forms of symmetry requiring vertex transitivity. These forms of symmetry are useless in the study of the Reconstruction Conjecture, as regular graphs are reconstructible. On the opposite end of the spectrum, almost all graphs are rigid (have trivial automorphism group) [\cite=MR1864966]. Graphs with non-trivial, but non-transitive, automorphisms have received less attention.

Graph reconstruction and automorphism concepts have been presented together before [\cite=MR1373683] [\cite=MR1971819]. However, there appears to be no results on which pairs of groups allow the deletion relation. While our result is perhaps unsurprising, it is not trivial. The reader is challenged to produce an example for [formula] before proceeding.

For notation, G always denotes a graph, while Γ refers to a group. The trivial group I consists of only the identity element, ε. All graphs in this paper are finite, simple, and undirected, unless specified otherwise. All groups are finite. The automorphism group of G is denoted [formula] and the stabilizer of a vertex v in a graph G is denoted [formula].

Definitions and Basic Tools

We begin with a formal definition of the deletion relation.

Let Γ1,Γ2 be finite groups. If there exists a graph G with |V(G)|  ≥  3 and vertex v∈V(G) so that [formula] and [formula], then Γ1 (vertex) deletes to Γ2, denoted Γ1  →  Γ2. Similarly, the group Γ1 edge deletes to Γ2 if there exists a graph G and edge e∈E(G) so that [formula] and [formula]. If a specific graph G and subobject x give [formula] and [formula], the deletion relation may be presented as [formula].

To determine the automorphism structure of a graph, vertices that are not in the same orbit can be distinguished by means of neighboring structures. A useful gadget to make such distinctions is the rigid tree T(n), where n is an integer at least 2. Build T(n) by starting with a path [formula]. For each i,1  ≤  i  ≤  n, add a path [formula] of length 2i + 1. This results in a tree with n + 1 leaves. Note that each leaf ui is distance 2i + 1 to a vertex of degree 3 (except for un, which is distance 2n + 2). Thus, the leaves are in disjoint orbits and T(n) is rigid. Also, if any leaf ui is selected with i  ≥  1, T(n) - ui is rigid. This gives an example of the deletion relation I  →  I. For notation, let J be a set and {Tj}j∈J be disjoint copies of T(n). Then ui(Tj) designates the copy of ui in Tj. This is well-defined since there is a unique isomorphism between each Tj and T(n).

For any group Γ, a simple, unlabeled, undirected graph G exists with [formula] [\cite=MR1557026]. The construction is derived from the well-known Cayley graph. Define C(Γ) to be a graph with vertex set Γ and complete directed edge set, where the edge (γ,β) is labeled with γ- 1β, the element whose right-multiplication on γ results in β. The automorphism group of C(Γ) is Γ, and the action on the vertices follows right multiplication by elements in Γ. That is, if γ∈Γ, the permutation σγ will take a vertex α to the vertex αγ.

This directed graph with labeled edge sets is converted to an undirected and unlabeled graph by swapping the labeled edges with gadgets. Specifically, order the elements of [formula] so that α1  =  ε. For each edge (γ,β), subdivide the edge labeled αi  =  γ- 1β with vertices x1,x2, and attach a copy Tγ,β of T(i) by identifying u0(Tγ,β) with x1. Note that i  ≥  2 in these cases, since αi  ≠  ε. See Figure [\ref=fig:addflags] for an example of this process.

Denote this modified graph C'(Γ). We refer to it as the Cayley graph of Γ. Note that the automorphisms of C'(Γ) are uniquely determined by the permutation of the group elements and preserve the original edge labels, since the trees T(i) identify the label αi and have a unique isomorphism between copies. Hence, [formula].

Every automorphism of G is represented by right-multiplication of Γ. Hence, every automorphism except the identity map will displace ε.

Deletion Relations with the Trivial Group

Now that sufficient tools are available, we prove some basic properties.

(The Reflexive Property) For any group Γ, Γ  →  Γ.

Let Γ be non-trivial, as the trivial case has been handled by the rigid tree T(n). Let G be the Cayley graph C'(Γ). Create a supergraph G' by adding a dominating vertex v with a pendant vertex u. Now, u is the only vertex of degree 1, and v is the only vertex adjacent to u. Hence, these two vertices are distinguished in G' from the vertices of G. Removing v leaves G and the isolated vertex u. Thus, Γ is the automorphism group for both G' and G' - v.

A key part of our final proof relies on the trivial group deleting to any group.

Let G  =  C'(Γ). Let n  =  |Γ|. Order the group elements of Γ as [formula]. Create a supergraph, G', by adding vertices as follows: For each αi, create a copy Tαi of T(2n) and identify u0(Tαi) with the vertex αi in G (Here, 2n is used to distinguish these copies from the edge gadgets). Add a vertex v that is adjacent to ui(Tαi) for each i. For each αi, the leaf of Tαi adjacent to v distinguishes αi. Hence, no automorphisms exist in G'. However, G' - v restores all automorphisms π from [formula] by mapping Tαi to Tπ(αi) through the unique isomorphism.

Note that this proof uses a very special vertex that enforces all vertices to be distinguished. Before producing examples where deleting a vertex removes symmetry, it may be useful to remark that such a distinguished vertex cannot be used.

Let [formula]. The restriction map π|G - v is an automorphism of G - v.

The implication of this lemma is removing a vertex with a trivial orbit cannot remove automorphisms. However, we can remove all symmetry in a graph using a single vertex deletion.

Assume [formula], since the reflexive property handles this case. Let G  =  C'(Γ) and n  =  |Γ|.

Let G1,G2 be copies of G with isomorphisms f1 :G  →  G1 and f2 :G  →  G2. Create a graph G' from these two copies as follows. For all elements γ in Γ, create a copy Tγ of T(n) and identify u0(Tγ) with f1(γ) and un(Tγ) with f2(γ). Note that [formula], since no vertices from G1 can map to G2 from the asymmetry of the Tγ subgraphs, and any automorphism of G1 extends to exactly one automorphism of G2.

Any automorphism π of G'  -  f1(ε) must induce an automorphism π|G2 of G2. But the vertices of G1 must then permute similarly (by the definition π(f1(x))  =  f1f- 12πf2(x)). Since f1(ε) is not in the image of π, π stabilizes f2(ε). Lemma [\ref=lma:cayleystable] implies π must be the identity map. Hence, [formula].

Deletion Relations Between Any Two Groups

We are sufficiently prepared to construct a graph to reveal the deletion relation for all pairs of groups.

If Γ1 and Γ2 are groups, then Γ1  →  Γ2.

Assume both groups are non-trivial, since Lemmas [\ref=lma:trivialtoall] and [\ref=lma:grouptrivial] cover these cases. Let G1  =  C'(Γ1). Then identify v1∈V(G1) as the vertex corresponding to ε∈Γ1. Note that [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lma:cayleystable]. Also by Lemma [\ref=lma:trivialtoall], there exists a graph G2 and vertex v2 so that [formula]. Define ni  =  |Γi|. Order the elements of Γ1 as [formula] so that α1,1  =  ε  =  v1.

We collect the necessary properties of G1,G2,v1,v2 before continuing. First, G1 has automorphisms [formula] and v1 is trivially stabilized ([formula]). Second, G2 is rigid ([formula]) but G2 - v2 has automorphisms [formula]. The following construction only depends on these requirements.

Let [formula] be copies of G2. Construct a graph G by taking the disjoint union of G1, H1, [formula] Hn1, and adding edges between α1,i and every vertex of Hi, for [formula]. Since [formula], the automorphism group of G cannot permute the vertices within each Hi. However, the vertices of G1 can permute freely within [formula], since [formula] for all i,j. Hence, [formula].

When the copy of v2 in H1 is deleted from G, the automorphisms of H1 - v2 are Γ2. However, the vertex v1 of G1 is now distinguished since it is adjacent to a copy of G2 - v2, unlike the other elements of Γ1 in G1 which are adjacent to a copy of G2. This means the permutations of G1 must stabilize v1. Since [formula], the only permutation allowed on G1 is the identity. However, H1 - v2 has automorphism group Γ2. Hence, [formula].

Figure [\ref=fig:vertexall] presents a visualization of the automorphisms in this construction before and after the deletion. A very similar construction produces this general result for the edge case.

If Γ1 and Γ2 are groups, then there exists a graph G and an edge e∈E(G) so that [formula].

Set ni  =  |Γi|. Let G1  =  C'(Γ1) with v1 corresponding to ε∈Γ1 and order the elements of Γ1 similarly to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:vertexall].

Form G2 by starting with C'(Γ2) and making a copy Tγ of T(2n2) for each element γ∈Γ2, identifying γ∈V(C'(Γ2)) with u0(Tγ). Now, add an edge e between u2n2(T1) and u2n2 - 1(T1). This distinguishes the element ε as a vertex in C'(Γ2) and hence is stabilized. So, [formula] and if e is removed all group elements are symmetric again, so [formula].

Notice that G1,G2,v1,e satisfy the requirements of the construction of G in Theorem [\ref=thm:vertexall]. Hence, the same construction (with e in place of v2) provides an example of edge deletion from Γ1 to Γ2.

Note that the graph produced for Theorem [\ref=thm:edgeall] can be used for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:vertexall] by subdividing e and using the resulting vertex as the deletion point.

Future Work

While the question posed in this paper is answered completely for the class of all graphs, there remain questions for special cases. For instance, the automorphism groups of trees are fully understood [\cite=MR607504]. Let GT be the class of groups that are represented by the automorphism groups of trees and GF represented by automorphisms of forests. The constructions in this paper are not trees, so new methods will be required to answer the following questions. If we restrict to trees, can any group in GT delete to any group in GF? Or, if we restrict to deleting leaves (and hence stay connected) can all pairs of groups in GT delete to each other?

Another interesting aspect of our construction is that the resulting graphs are very large, with the order of the graphs cubic in the size of the groups. Which of these relations can be realized by small graphs? Can we restrict the groups that can appear based on the order of the graph? The current-best upper bound on the order of a graph G with automorphism groups isomorphic to a given group Γ is |V(G)|  ≤  2|Γ| and [formula] [\cite=BabaiOrder]. This has particular application to McKay's generation algorithm, where only "small" examples are usually computed (for example, all connected graphs up to 11 vertices were computed in [\cite=MR1448235]). To demonstrate that this is not trivial, see Figure [\ref=fig:z2toz3] for a graph showing [formula].

While Theorem [\ref=thm:vertexall] shows that there exists a graph where some vertex can be deleted to demonstrate the deletion relations, our constructions have many other vertices that behave in very different ways when they are deleted. When relating to the Reconstruction Conjecture, this raises questions regarding the combinations of automorphism groups that appear in the vertex-deleted subgraphs. For instance, if the multiset of vertex-deleted automorphism groups is provided, can one reconstruct the automorphism group? This question only gives the groups, but not the vertex-deleted subgraphs. An example is that n copies of Sn - 1 must reconstruct to Sn, but it is unknown whether the graph is Kn or nK1. Since [formula], this ambiguity will always naturally arise. Can it arise in other contexts? Is the automorphism group recognizable from a vertex deck?
