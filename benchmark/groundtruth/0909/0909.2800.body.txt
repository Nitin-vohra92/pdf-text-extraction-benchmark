Criteria for the stability of the finiteness property and for the uniqueness of Barabanov norms

Introduction

Let A be a bounded set of d  ×  d real or complex matrices. The joint spectral radius of A, introduced by G.-C. Rota and W. G. Strang in [\cite=RS], is defined to be the quantity

[formula]

which may easily be shown to yield a finite value which is independent of the choice of norm [formula]. The joint spectral radius has been the subject of substantial recent research interest, which has dealt with its applications [\cite=Gu] [\cite=Koz] [\cite=MO] [\cite=DL0] [\cite=Mae2] [\cite=GZ], with issues of its computation and approximation [\cite=Koz] [\cite=Mae2] [\cite=Koz2] [\cite=BN] [\cite=BW] [\cite=Gr] [\cite=LW] [\cite=MQBWF] [\cite=Prot] [\cite=BT1], and with the study of its mathematical properties [\cite=Ba] [\cite=GWZ] [\cite=Wirth1] [\cite=Wirth2]. In this article we investigate the finiteness property, a property of sets of matrices A which facilitates the computation of ϱ(A), and the Barabanov norm, a theoretical construction associated to a set of matrices A whose applications have been explored in [\cite=Koz2] [\cite=Ba] [\cite=Wirth1] [\cite=Koz3].

Let us begin by establishing some notation. Throughout this article we shall use the symbol [formula] to stand for either [formula] or [formula]. Statements which are expressed using [formula] should thus be understood as being valid in both the case [formula] and the case [formula]. For [formula] we let [formula] denote the ring of d  ×  d matrices over [formula], and let | | |  ·  | | | denote the Euclidean norm on [formula]. To simplify the statement of some of our results we shall find it convenient to work primarily with ordered sets of elements of [formula]. Thus, for each pair of integers [formula] we let [formula] denote the set of all ordered r-tuples of elements of [formula]. We equip each [formula] with the metric

[formula]

An r-tuple [formula] is said to have the finiteness property if there exist [formula] and [formula] such that [formula]. The finiteness property was introduced by J. Lagarias and Y. Wang, who conjectured in [\cite=LW] that it is satisfied by every finite set of matrices. Theoretical results giving various preconditions for the finiteness property were established in [\cite=LW] [\cite=Gu2]. The existence of pairs of matrices lacking the finiteness property was later demonstrated by T. Bousch and J. Mairesse in [\cite=BM] (see also [\cite=Koz3] [\cite=BTV]). Exceptions to the finiteness property nonetheless seem to be rare: M. Maesumi conjectures in [\cite=Mae] that the finiteness property holds for almost all finite sets of matrices in the sense of Lebesgue measure on [formula], and in a similar vein V. Blondel and R. Jungers conjecture in [\cite=BJ] that the finiteness property holds for every finite set of rational matrices. In the first theorem in this article we contribute to the study of the finiteness property by showing that for each r,d  ≥  2, an open set of r-tuples of matrices in [formula] has the finiteness property.

We shall call an r-tuple [formula] reducible if there exists a linear space [formula], not equal to {0} or [formula], which is preserved by every Ai. Otherwise A shall be called irreducible. Reducibility of A is equivalent to the existence of nonzero vectors [formula] such that for each [formula], [formula] for every [formula]. We let [formula] denote the set of irreducible elements of [formula]. It is straightforward to show that [formula] is open and dense in [formula].

A norm [formula] on [formula] will be called extremal for [formula] if [formula] for every i. We shall say that [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A if the equation

[formula]

is satisfied for every [formula], which in particular implies that [formula] is extremal. If A is irreducible then ϱ(A) is nonzero and a Barabanov norm for A exists [\cite=Ba] [\cite=Wirth1]. Clearly [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A if and only if every norm proportional to [formula] is also a Barabanov norm, so we shall simply say that A has a 'unique' Barabanov norm to mean that all of the Barabanov norms for A are proportional to one another. In the second theorem in this article we shall give a sufficient condition for the Barabanov norm of A to be unique.

To state our first theorem we require some further definitions. For each [formula] we let Ωnr denote the set [formula] , which we refer to as the set of words of length n over the alphabet [formula]. We shall say that two words [formula] are rotation equivalent, and write z  ~  ω, if there exists k such that [formula]. We write ω  =  zp, and say that ω is a power of z, if ω∈Ωnpr consists of p repetitions of the word z∈Ωnr. Clearly ~   defines an equivalence relation on each Ωnr, and if [formula] and [formula] then [formula]. In the terminology of [\cite=BTV], z  ~  ω if and only if z and ω have the same length and are 'essentially equal'.

If [formula] and [formula] is any matrix norm, then by a theorem of M. A. Berger and Y. Wang [\cite=BW],

[formula]

which in particular implies that [formula] is continuous for every [formula].

Let us say that [formula] satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis if there exists a word [formula], which we call a characteristic word for A, such that for every Barabanov norm [formula] for A, we have [formula] whenever [formula]. This condition implies that [formula] for every [formula], since if this were to fail for some m then we would have

[formula]

contradicting [\eqref=ZOMGBWF]. It follows that if A satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis with characteristic word [formula] then it satisfies the finiteness property with [formula]. The reader may note that if ω∈Ωnr is a characteristic word for A, then ∈Ωnr is a characteristic word if and only if   ~  ω, and for every [formula], ωp∈Ωnpr is also a characteristic word for A. The strong finiteness hypothesis has the following important property:

Let [formula] and ω∈Ωnr. Then the set of all [formula] such that A satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis with characteristic word ω is an open subset of [formula].

The strong finiteness hypothesis appears to be problematic to verify, even in cases where A is otherwise easily analysed. Some illustrative examples are given in the following section. It is tempting to conjecture the following possible generalisation, which would be of broader practical value:

Let [formula] and ∈Ωnr, and let [formula] be the set of all r-tuples [formula] for which there exists an extremal norm [formula] with the property that [formula] whenever [formula]. Then [formula] is an open subset of [formula].

We remark that the principal obstruction to such a result would appear to be the lack of a natural candidate extremal norm [formula] for [formula] close to A. Indeed, the proof of Theorem [\ref=FIST] functions by showing that if A satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis, then every Barabanov norm for B is such a candidate norm.

While the strong finiteness hypothesis is quite a strict condition, we are nonetheless able to construct examples in which it is satisfied:

Let [formula] and [formula], and suppose that ω is not equal to a power of a shorter word. Then there exists [formula] such that A satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis with characteristic word ω, the Ai are pairwise distinct, and [formula].

An easy consequence of Theorem [\ref=FIST] and Proposition [\ref=TheProposition] is that for every r,d  ≥  2, there exists a nonempty open subset of [formula] in which the finiteness property is everywhere satisfied. In view of Proposition [\ref=TheProposition] it seems natural to ask the following question, which the author is not at present able to resolve: for fixed r,d  ≥  2, is it the case that every [formula] arises as the characteristic word of some [formula]?

In order to state our second theorem we require some further definitions. Given [formula] let us define

[formula]

for each [formula]. We shall say that A is product bounded if the set [formula] is a bounded subset of [formula], and that A is relatively product bounded if ϱ(A) > 0 and ϱ(A)- 1A is product bounded. If ϱ(A) > 0 and A admits an extremal norm then clearly A must be relatively product bounded, so in particular every irreducible A has this property. For relatively product bounded A the limit semigroup of A, introduced by F. Wirth in [\cite=Wirth1], is defined to be the set

[formula]

In this article we shall say that [formula] has the rank one property if it is relatively product bounded and every nonzero element of S(A) has rank one. By Proposition [\ref=TheProposition], every [formula] with r,d  ≥  2 contains some A satisfying the rank one property. It turns out that the rank one property is also stable under small perturbations:

For each [formula] the set of all [formula] satisfying the rank one property is open. In the particular case [formula], d = 2 this set is also dense.

As an aside, we remark that there exist open subsets of [formula] in which the rank one property does not hold. For example, let us consider the irreducible (with respect to [formula]) pair of matrices A = (A1,A2) given by

[formula]

Since clearly | | |A1| | | = ρ(A1) = 1 and [formula] we have ϱ(A) = ρ(A1) = 1. If [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A then [formula] since this matrix is a scalar multiple of the identity; it follows that A satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis with ω  =  (1). By Theorem [\ref=FIST] there exists a small open neighbourhood U of A such that every B = (B1,B2)∈U is irreducible and satisfies ϱ(B) = ρ(B1). However, if B is close enough to A then B1 must have a conjugate pair of eigenvalues, and it follows that S(B) contains the identity matrix when B is close enough to A.

We shall say that [formula] has the unbounded agreements property if for any [formula] and any pair of sequences [formula] such that

[formula]

for m = 1,2, there exist [formula] such that i(n1 + k) = j(n2 + k) throughout the range 1  ≤  k  ≤  N. It is straightforward to show that the strong finiteness hypothesis implies the unbounded agreements property, and thus Proposition [\ref=TheProposition] implies that the unbounded agreements property is also satisfied in a nonempty subset of [formula] which contains an open set. On the other hand, the unbounded agreements property does not imply the finiteness property. If A denotes the pair of matrices shown in [\cite=BM] to lack the finiteness property, then the existence of a unique height-maximizing shift-invariant measure on [formula] forces the unbounded agreements property to hold. We defer the proof of this assertion to a later publication.

We may now state our second theorem:

Suppose that [formula] is relatively product-bounded and satisfies both the unbounded agreements property and the rank one property. Then there exists at most one Barabanov norm for A up to multiplication by a scalar.

By combining all four of the results in this section one may easily obtain:

For each r,d  ≥  2 there exists a nonempty open set [formula] with the property that for every A∈U, A satisfies the finiteness property, the unbounded agreements property and the rank one property, and has a unique Barabanov norm.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In the following section we give some examples of the applications and limitations of Theorems [\ref=FIST] and [\ref=UBN], showing in particular that both the unbounded agreements property and the rank one property are necessary parts of the latter theorem. In §[\ref=poves] we give the proofs of Theorems [\ref=FIST] and [\ref=UBN] and Propositions [\ref=TheProposition] and [\ref=R1P]. Finally, in §[\ref=purple-aki] we briefly describe the relationship between Theorems [\ref=FIST] and [\ref=UBN] and certain recent results in ergodic theory.

Examples

In each of the examples below we may take [formula] to be either [formula] or [formula]. The reader may readily verify that each example is irreducible in both of the two cases.

Example 1. Define

[formula]

where 0  ≤  |λ1|,|λ2| < 1. Then A = (A1,A2) satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis, has the unbounded agreements property and the rank one property, and has a unique Barabanov norm. (In the case λ1  =  λ2 = 0 this is the example given by Proposition [\ref=TheProposition] with r = n = 2.)

A straightforward calculation yields | | |A1A2| | |  =  | | |A2A1| | | = ρ(A1A2) = 1, | | |A21| | |  =  |λ1| < 1 and | | |A22| | |  =  |λ2| < 1, from which it follows that ϱ(A) = 1. If [formula] has [formula] then it follows that there must exist n0 > 0 such that i(n0 + 2n + 1) = 1 and i(n0 + 2n) = 2 for every [formula], which implies the unbounded agreements property. Since | det A1|,| det A2| < 1 it is clear that every element of S(A) has determinant zero and hence has rank at most equal to one. The norm defined by [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A, since for each [formula]

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=UBN] it is the only such norm up to scalar multiplication. Direct calculation then shows that [formula] and hence the strong finiteness hypothesis holds.

Example 2. Define

[formula]

where 0 < |λ| < 1. Then A = (A1,A2) has the finiteness property, the unbounded agreements property and the rank one property, but does not satisfy the strong finiteness hypothesis.

Straightforward calculation shows that | | |A1| | |  =  ρ(A1) = 1 and | | |A2| | |  =  |λ| < 1 so that in particular ϱ(A) = 1 and A has the finiteness property. The unbounded agreements property and the rank one property follow in the same manner as for the previous example. Define a norm on [formula] by [formula]. For each [formula] we have

[formula]

and therefore [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A. Define [formula]. For each [formula] we have [formula] and therefore [formula], and clearly we also have [formula]. We deduce that no ω∈Ωn2 can be a characteristic word for A, and since n is arbitrary we conclude that A does not satisfy the strong finiteness hypothesis.

Example 3. Define

[formula]

where 0 < |λ| < 1. Then A = (A1,A2) has the unbounded agreements property and the finiteness property, but lacks the rank one property, and has more than one Barabanov norm.

Clearly | | |A1| | |  =  ρ(A1) = 1 and | | |A2| | | = |λ| < 1. It follows that ϱ(A) = 1 and that A satisfies the finiteness property, and the unbounded agreements property follows as before. It is clear that I∈S(A) and hence A does not satisfy the rank one property. For any p  ≥  1 the norm [formula] defined by [formula] is a Barabanov norm since [formula] for all [formula].

Example 4. Define

[formula]

where 0 < |λ| < 1. Then A = (A1,A2,A3) has the rank one property and the finiteness property, but lacks the unbounded agreements property, and has more than one Barabanov norm.

Clearly ϱ(A) = 1, and A does not satisfy the unbounded agreements property since lim n  →    ∞An1  =  A1  ≠  0 but also  lim n  →    ∞An2 = A2  ≠  0. If A∈An with [formula] then necessarily A = An3 and hence | | |A| | |  =  |λ|n. It follows that S(A) cannot contain a matrix of rank 2. If |λ|  ≤  ξ  ≤  |λ|- 1 then the norm [formula] defined by [formula] is a Barabanov norm, since for every [formula]

[formula]

as required.

Proofs of Theorems [\ref=FIST] and [\ref=UBN] and Propositions [\ref=TheProposition] and [\ref=R1P]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=FIST]

Let N denote the set of all norms on [formula], and for [formula] define

[formula]

It is clear that dN is a metric on N. Moreover, if Z  ⊂  N is closed and has finite diameter with respect to dN, then it follows from the Arzéla-Ascoli theorem that Z is compact. We require the following lemma:

Let [formula], let [formula] be a sequence of elements of [formula] converging to some [formula], and for each k let [formula] be a Barabanov norm for A(k) such that [formula]. Then the sequence of norms [formula] has an accumulation point in N which is a Barabanov norm for A.

Let [formula] and [formula] for each [formula]. By hypothesis the set [formula] is a compact subset of [formula], and it follows from [\cite=Wirth1] that the set [formula] has finite diameter as a subset of N. It follows that there exist a subsequence (kj)∞j = 1 and norm [formula] such that [formula]. If [formula], then for [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

implying that

[formula]

for all such i and v. We conclude that for every [formula]

[formula]

and [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A.

For each [formula] and [formula] let us now define

[formula]

Let [formula] be arbitrary. If for each k we choose [formula] such that [formula], then by rescaling each [formula] so that [formula] and applying Lemma [\ref=wirthlemma] with [formula], we see that the supremum in [\eqref=blegg] is always attained.

We claim that each [formula] is upper semi-continuous. For each [formula] let [formula] and suppose that [formula]. Choose some arbitrary [formula] and for each [formula] let [formula] be a Barabanov norm such that [formula] and [formula]. Choose a sequence of integers (kj)∞j = 1 such that lim j  →    ∞Θω(A(kj))  =   lim sup k  →    ∞Θω(A(k)). By Lemma [\ref=wirthlemma], we may replace (kj) with a finer subsequence such that [formula], where [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A. It follows that

[formula]

since [formula] is a Barabanov norm for A, which proves the claim.

Now let us consider some fixed ∈Ωnr. Since the supremum in [\eqref=blegg] is attained for every A and ω, it follows that [formula] satisfies the strong finiteness hypothesis with characteristic word [formula] if and only if

[formula]

We have shown that each of the functions Θω is upper semi-continuous, and since ϱ depends continuously on A it follows that the set of all [formula] solving the inequality [\eqref=botschafter] must be open. The proof is complete.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=TheProposition]

Let [formula], and let [formula]. We shall begin by proving Proposition [\ref=TheProposition] subject to the additional assumption that [formula] includes at least one instance of every symbol [formula].

Let [formula] be the standard basis for [formula], and let [formula] be the norm on [formula] given by [formula]. Define an r-tuple of matrices [formula] by setting Aωiei: = ei + 1 for 1  ≤  i < n and Aωnen: = e1, and Ajek: = 0 in all other cases. Clearly [formula] and [formula] for every i, and it follows that [formula]. If 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  r then by hypothesis there is k such that j = ωk  ≠  i and therefore Aiek  ≠  Ajek, so in particular we have Ai  ≠  Aj and the matrices forming A are pairwise distinct. We claim that if [formula] then [formula], which clearly implies that [formula] must be a characteristic word for A. Let [formula] and suppose that [formula]. To simplify notation in the remainder of this paragraph it will be convenient to add subscripts modulo n, identifying n + 1 with 1, n + 2 with 2, et cetera. Since [formula] is nonzero there must exist k such that [formula]. From the definition of A it follows that z1  =  ωk and Az1ek  =  ek + 1. We must then have Az2ek + 1  ≠  0 and by the same reasoning it follows that z2  =  ωk + 1 and Az2Az1ek  =  Az2ek + 1 = ek + 2. Proceeding inductively in this fashion we obtain [formula] and [formula], proving the claim.

If [formula] for some k  ≠  1 then the above reasoning shows that [formula]. It follows from this that [formula] is equal to [formula] where [formula] and n = pq. Since [formula] is by hypothesis not equal to a power of a shorter word we deduce that [formula] has rank equal to one as claimed.

It remains to show that A is irreducible. Let [formula] with u  ≠  0, and suppose that for every [formula] one has [formula] for every [formula]. We claim that necessarily v = 0, implying the irreducibility of A. Since u  ≠  0 there is k such that [formula]. Now, from the previous two paragraphs it follows that

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

We deduce in particular that [formula], and that for each [formula] we must have [formula] for every [formula]. Since by construction [formula] for [formula], we conclude that [formula] must equal zero for every j, and it follows that v = 0, proving the claim. This completes the proof of the theorem subject to our additional assumption.

The general case now follows easily. It suffices to assume that there is 1  ≤  r' < r such that [formula] includes at least one instance of every symbol [formula], since we can always get to and from this situation by perturbing the indices [formula] in some manner. Let [formula] be the r'-tuple of matrices produced by the preceding argument. To extend this to a full r-tuple we simply let [formula] be given by small scalar multiples of the matrices already defined. If the modulus of each scalar is strictly less than one then it is clearly that this yields an irreducible r-tuple A with ϱ(A) = 1. If [formula] is a Barabanov norm and [formula] with [formula], then either [formula] if zi  ≤  r' for every i, or [formula] if otherwise. The proof is complete.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=R1P]

We shall use the following simple characterisation of the rank one property:

Let [formula] be relatively product bounded. Then A has the rank one property if and only if [formula], where [formula] is the r-tuple which consists of the second exterior powers of the matrices comprising A.

By normalising A if necessary it clearly suffices to consider the case ϱ(A) = 1. Let [formula] denote the standard norm on [formula]. Recall that for every [formula] we have

[formula]

see e.g. [\cite=Bhatia]. In particular [formula] is at most 1.

Suppose that [formula]. Given any nonzero matrix A∈S(A), choose an increasing sequence of integers (nk)∞k = 1 and a sequence of matrices (Ank)∞k = 1 such that Ank∈Ank for every k, and lim k  →    ∞Ank  =  A. Since [formula] we have [formula]. It follows from [\eqref=Bh] that A has rank equal to 1 and we conclude that the rank one property holds.

Suppose conversely that [formula]. It follows that we can choose a sequence (An)∞n = 1 with each An∈An such that [formula], since if for any n this choice were not possible we would have [formula] by [\eqref=ZOMGBWF]. Since A is product bounded we may take a subsequence (nk)∞k = 1 and matrix A∈S(A) such that lim k  →    ∞Ank  =  A. Since [formula] for every n we have [formula]. By [\eqref=Bh] it follows that the rank of A is at least two, and we conclude that the rank one property does not hold.

The proof of Proposition [\ref=R1P] now follows easily. Since the maps from [formula] into [formula] given by A  ↦  ϱ(A) and [formula] are both continuous, the set of all [formula] such that [formula] is open.

To see that the rank one property holds for a dense subset of [formula] we argue as follows. If [formula] meets the condition that each Ai has two distinct eigenvalues which are unequal in modulus, then

[formula]

Since this condition is easily seen to be hold for a dense open subset of [formula], it follows that it holds for a dense open subset of [formula] also, which implies that the rank one property holds for this set.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=UBN]

Let [formula] and suppose that A satisfies the unbounded agreements property. Without loss of generality we normalise A so as to obtain ϱ(A) = 1. Let [formula] and [formula] be Barabanov norms for A which are not proportional to each other. Note that the existence of a Barabanov norm implies that A is product bounded. We will establish Theorem [\ref=UBN] by showing that under these hypotheses the rank one property cannot hold.

Rescaling one of the two norms if necessary, there exists a real number λ > 1 such that

[formula]

Let us define subsets X1, X2 of [formula] by

[formula]

[formula]

Clearly X1 and X2 are nonempty and compact, and satisfy [formula]. Note also that if v1∈X1 and v2∈X2 then v1 and v2 are linearly independent.

To begin the proof we show that there exist sequences [formula] and vectors u1∈X1 and u2∈X2 such that for every natural number n we have [formula] for m = 1,2. Let u1 and u2 be arbitrary elements of X1 and X2 respectively. Since [formula] is a Barabanov norm there exists [formula] such that [formula] and consequently

[formula]

which implies that Ai1(1)u1∈X1. Applying this procedure with the vector Ai1(1)u1 in place of u1 allows us to define i1(2) with the property that Ai1(2)Ai1(1)u1∈X1. Proceeding inductively in this manner we may thus construct the sequence i1. The construction of the sequence i2 may be undertaken in precisely the same fashion.

We next claim that for every [formula] there exist a function [formula] and two vectors [formula], [formula] such that for [formula] and m = 1,2 one has [formula]. To see this, let i1,i2 and u1,u2 be the sequences and vectors defined above. Since [formula] for each [formula] and for m = 1,2, we conclude that neither of the two sequences of matrices [formula] converges to zero in the limit n  →    ∞  . Let [formula]. By the unbounded agreements property it follows that there exist [formula] such that i1(n1 + k) = i2(n2 + k) throughout the range [formula]. Taking [formula] for [formula] and setting [formula] for m = 1,2 proves the claim.

We may now complete the proof. For each [formula] and m = 1,2 we have [formula] and therefore [formula]. It follows that we may choose a subsequence [formula] such that the sequence of matrices (Bn)∞n = 1 given by [formula] converges to a nonzero matrix [formula]. By definition we have B∈S(A). Since each Xm is compact, by taking further subsequences if necessary we may assume that [formula] for m = 1,2. For each [formula] and m = 1,2 we have [formula], and it follows from this that Bv1∈X1, Bv2∈X2. But this implies that Bv1 and Bv2 are linearly independent, and we have obtained B∈S(A) with [formula]. Thus A lacks the rank one property and the proof is complete.

Connections with ergodic theory

The proof of Theorem [\ref=UBN] is suggested by a lemma of T. Bousch in ergodic theory [\cite=B1], which we shall briefly describe. Define a map [formula] by T(x) = 2x( mod 1) and let [formula] be Lipschitz continuous. If we then define

[formula]

then Bousch's Lemme C gives criteria under which the functional equation

[formula]

admits at most one continuous solution g up to the addition of a real constant. The similarity between the functional equations [\eqref=Bnorm] and [\eqref=bush] was previously remarked on by Bousch in the manuscript [\cite=Brect]. When more than one solution to [\eqref=bush] exists, moreover, the set of all sufficiently regular solutions is an equicontinuous family [\cite=CLOS], a result suggestive of [\cite=Wirth1].

The idea of Theorem [\ref=FIST] was suggested to the author by a theorem of Contreras, Lopes and Thieullen which is closely related to the work of Bousch described above [\cite=CLT]. However, the proof of Theorem [\ref=FIST] in its final form has no direct connection with the argument in [\cite=CLT]. Connections between the joint spectral radius and optimisation problems in ergodic theory are also investigated by the author in [\cite=MQBWF] [\cite=MGBWF].
