Noise Characteristics of Molecular Oscillations in Simple Genetic Oscillatory Systems

INTRODUCTION

Molecular events driving cellular processes, such as the binding/unbinding of transcription factors to DNA sites, the transcription of mRNAs, the translation of proteins from the transcribed mRNAs, and their degradations, are fundamentally stochastic processes governed by probabilistic contacts between these molecules and intracellular diffusion [\cite=review1]. Therefore understanding the dynamic fluctuations in the genetic regulatory system arising from such stochasticity is crucial as they may provide a potential obstacle in maintaining the robustness of the cellular function and the homeostasis of the cellular behavior directly or indirectly. Study on stochastic fluctuations of cellular dynamics has been accelerated by the recent advances in synthetic biology [\cite=synthetic-review1] [\cite=synthetic-review2] and in experimental techniques using the fluorescent proteins [\cite=elowitz-review], which has allowed us to monitor the fluctuating molecular activities at the single-cell level in a controlled and designed manner. Theoretical framework with which stochastic dynamics of molecule number in time around the steady state can be analyzed has been developed and applied for simple gene expression systems [\cite=paulsson1]. How the fluctuation (or "noise") in one molecular component propagates to the downstream components in a simple, linear genetic network has also been studied [\cite=propa].

Most studies so far, however, concern fluctuations around the steady state, such as the variance in protein number around its temporally-averaged constant mean value. Meanwhile, there are only a limited number of experimental and theoretical studies concerning out-of-steady-state activities, such as oscillatory gene expression [\cite=cyano]. Therefore, their characteristics of dynamic fluctuations are largely unknown. To address this, here we study the characteristics of fluctuations in the non-steady states, that of oscillatory systems in particular, by using a model genetic oscillatory system. Undoubtedly, oscillatory system is one of the most important systems that never reach steady states, which underlie a number of important cellular and physiological processes ranging from bacterial chemotaxis to mammalian circadian rhythms [\cite=goldbeter] [\cite=cellcycle] [\cite=stochastic]. A number of synthetic gene circuits with a few components and relatively simple regulatory mechanisms have been constructed to realize oscillatory dynamics in protein numbers in vivo [\cite=repressilator] [\cite=hasty1] [\cite=mammalian]. Among these models, we consider the so-called repressilator (Fig. 1) [\cite=repressilator], a simple negative feedback circuit with three genetic components, for its simplicity in the regulatory processes involved, thus making it appropriate for a starting point in a systematic understanding of the noise properties of more complicated oscillatory systems.

The repressilator system has been studied theoretically in both determinisitc [\cite=khammash] [\cite=goh] and stochastic [\cite=sasai1] [\cite=biham1] frameworks. Most of these works were concerned with the condition and the stability of sustained oscillations in the circuit with respect to various system parameters, such as DNA binding mechanisms, reaction rates, and plasmid numbers. A general conclusion from these studies was that the stability and the coherence of the oscillation depends strongly on the system parameters and that optimal conditions exist under which the system exhibits the most stable oscillations. However, even under the optimal conditions, the oscillation is never perfect, and "noise" is inevitable. It is, thus, necessary to know the general characteristics of the noise in oscillatory dynamics in such a stable oscillation regime, which is currently lacking. Our primary aim in this paper is to fill this gap by performing a detailed analysis of noisy oscillations in this system.

Fluctuations in stable oscillatory dynamics can be classified into two major classes: global and local noise. The former refers to fluctuations in the global variables of oscillatory signals, such as the oscillation periods and amplitudes, resulting from a series of temporally organized molecular events. The latter is mainly due to momentary stochastic stepwise changes in the molecule number, which occur locally around the overall oscillatory signal. Previous studies on dynamic fluctuations have mostly been concerned with the latter. For the oscillatory activities, however, the characteristics of global noise or fluctuation is equally, if not more, important, as both the robust control of periods and achievement of sufficiently strong and regular strength (amplitudes) of the signal would be required for an appropriate response of the cell under fluctuating and noisy condition. Thus, our focus in this work is toward the characterization of the global noise and its propagation, with a brief discussion on the local noise.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we describe the repressilator model and the methods of numerical calculations. In Sec. III, we present the main results and discuss their interpretations and potential biological meanings. In the final section, we will summarize and conclude the paper.

Model and Methods

Repressilator Model

The repressilator [\cite=repressilator] is a plasmid fed into an E. coli, consisting of three transcriptional repressor genes (Fig. 1). The first gene is lacI from E. coli itself, encoding the transcriptional repressor protein LacI. LacI inhibits the transcription of the second gene tetR from the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10. TetR, the protein product of tetR, subsequently inhibits the transcription of the third gene cI originating from λ-phage. Finally, its protein product CI inhibits lacI expression, completing the tri-component negative feedback loop.

Elementary reaction steps involved in this process include the binding/unbinding of repressor proteins, mRNA transcription, translation into their protein product, and degradations of mRNA and protein molecules. The reaction rate for each of these steps is chosen as a typical value in the physiological condition following Ref. [\cite=repressilator]: The binding rate of repressor proteins to each operator site is B0 = 1 ~ - 1- 1; the unbinding rate of repressor proteins from the singly-occupied and doubly-occupied operator sites are U1 = 224 ~ - 1 and U2 = 9 ~ - 1, respectively; the protein translation rate is Θ = 0.167 ~ - 1 per mRNA molecule; and the half-life (inverse decay rate) of an mRNA molecule is τm = 120 ~ . The remaining reaction steps are mRNA transcription and protein degradation. We choose the transcription rate in the free (without inhibitor binding) state to be λ1  =  α  ~  - 1, and that in the inhibited state to be much slower as λ0 = 10- 3  ×  λ1. Finally, the half-life of a protein molecule is set to be τp  =  τm  /  β (Fig. 1). In this model setting, the two parameters α and β control the overall stability of the oscillatory behaviors, the characteristics of which have been studied in terms of deterministic modeling [\cite=repressilator] [\cite=khammash] [\cite=goh].

Stochastic Simulations: Gillespie Algorithm

To fully realize the stochastic trajectories of protein number dynamics, we perform dynamic Monte-Carlo simulations of the reaction processes. We use the exact stochastic method first developed by Gillespie in 1970s [\cite=gillespie]. This algorithm proceeds as follows: Given a list of reactions that can occur at the moment {Ri} with their reaction rates {ri}, the reaction occurring next is chosen randomly in proportion to the reaction rates. Then, the chosen reaction, say Rk, occurs, resulting in changes in the molecule numbers involved in that reaction. At the same time, the time elapses by δ, which is determined by a random number sampled from the exponential waiting time distribution Pw(δ) = rk exp ( - rkδ), following from the assumption that the reaction process is a Poisson process with a rate rk. We repeat these procedures for a sufficiently long period of time to obtain a sample trajectory of the given reaction system.

Stability of Stochastic Oscillations

We perform the stochastic simulation for repressilator dynamics by varying the parameters [formula] and β, each from 2- 10 to 210. Depending on the parameter values, the degree of stable oscillations exhibited by the stochastic dynamics varies [\cite=sasai1] [\cite=biham1]. To address that, we consider the auto-correlation function

[formula]

as a function of the time lag Δ, where pi(t) is the molecular number of protein i as a function of time, 〈x(t)〉 denotes the time average of x(t) over t, and σx(t) is the standard deviation thereof. For oscillatory signals, we have an oscillatory behavior in Γ(Δ). For imperfect oscillatory signals, Γ(Δ) decays in amplitude with Δ while oscillating. The more regular the sustained oscillation, the slower is the decay in the amplitude of Γ(Δ) with time; thus, the first peak in Γ(Δ) (Δ > 0) is higher. Therefore, we use the value of Γ(Δ) at the first peak as a stability measure for stochastic oscillations (Fig. 2).

Finding Oscillation Periods and Amplitudes

Due to constantly fluctuating protein numbers in time, it is not trivial to pinpoint exact timings of the start and the end of each oscillatory cycle under stochastic oscillations. In this work, we devise an ad-hoc procedure to determine the oscillation periods and amplitudes from a noisy oscillatory signal by assigning top and bottom points of the oscillation in the time series. To this end, we look at protein number dynamics at a coarse-grained level by introducing a time window, inside which local variations are integrated out. The width of the time window is chosen to be order of the longest single reaction time scale, 102  ~  , which we find suitable for our parameter choice, by comparing the result with manual assignments. We identify the maximum and the minimum points within each (non-overlapping) time window and use their time series to locate the oscillation peaks and valleys. Oscillation periods are then the time intervals between two successive peak positions, and amplitudes are the difference in protein numbers at the valley and the following peak position (Fig. 4(a)). Distributions of oscillation periods and amplitudes determined in this way are calculated from time series with a typical length 107  ~  .

RESULTS

Stability Diagram of the Stochastic Repressilator

The so-called stability diagram has been used to display whether the system exhibits sustained oscillations or not in the system parameter space [\cite=repressilator] [\cite=goh]. For the stochastic dynamics, one cannot set a strict borderline between the oscillating and the non-oscillating states due to the noisy dynamics. However, it is meaningful to ask if the overall stability characteristics of the oscillatory dynamics is affected by the stochasticity. In general, stochasticity elevates the degree of nonlinearity in the dynamics, thereby providing an additional potential source of instability leading to oscillatory behaviors [\cite=noise-induced]. In other cases, noise can quench the system's dynamics, thereby destroying the oscillatory activity [\cite=neuronal].

Figure 2(a) shows the stability diagram corresponding to stochastic oscillation of the repressilator, plotting the stability measure, the first peak value of Γ(Δ), in (α̃,β) space (Figs. 2(b,c)). There is a clear dark region near the center of the stability diagram with decreasing stability away from the center. This central region corresponds to the oscillation parameter region obtained in the deterministic modeling [\cite=repressilator] [\cite=goh]. There is, however, an additional dark region near [formula] with as high stability measure as the central one, suggesting the existence of sustained oscillations due to the fluctuation-driven instability (Fig. 3), an example of the so-called deviant effects [\cite=deviant]. In this additional region, which is on the border of the sustained oscillation regime in the deterministic dynamics, large amplitudal fluctuations are expected. This additional oscillatory region, however, although theoretically intriguing, may not be physiologically relevant because it corresponds to extremely unstable proteins with very short half-lives. In typical cells, the protein half-life is known to be typically much longer than that of mRNA, thus excluding large values of β.

In the following, we fix the parameters to be α = 1 / 2 and β = 1 / 4 (indicated by ×   in Fig. 2(a)), well inside the sustained oscillation region with the stability measure of 0.63, to study the fluctuation properties of the stochastic oscillations in the system. These parameter values are chosen to be close to those used specifically in Ref. [\cite=repressilator], as they reproduce well the in-vivo repressilator dynamics. We also verified that in this regime the stochastic simulation reproduces well the on-average characteristics of the deterministic dynamics such as the mean period and the mean amplitude, allowing us to focus exclusively on the additional role of stochasticity.

Single Protein-Species Level Fluctuation: Distribution of Oscillation Periods and Amplitudes

Due to the topological symmetry of the repressilator system and our choice of identical reaction parameters for all three components, the statistical properties of the protein number dynamics of the three genes are identical. Thus, we focus on the dynamics of the first gene product, LacI. A portion of the sample trajectory of the LacI time series is shown in Fig. 4(a). The distribution of oscillation periods PT(T) and that of amplitudes PA(A) obtained from the full simulation are shown in Figs. 4(b,c). The LacI protein number oscillates in time with a mean period μT = 6612 [formula] and a standard deviation σT = 747. Thus, the coefficient of variation (CV) is

[formula]

Looking closer, PT(T) decays like a Gaussian for large T while the distribution is skewed leftward and increases as [formula] for small T (inset of Fig. 4(b)).

For the amplitude, the fluctuation is found to be stronger, as can readily be seen from the sample time series in Fig. 4(a). The mean amplitude is μA = 3659 molecules, and the standard deviation is σA = 1588, corresponding to a CV of CV(A) = 0.43, almost fourfold larger than the periods. This higher degree of amplitude fluctuation suggests the necessity for regulatory mechanisms controlling the oscillation amplitude to build a more robust cellular oscillator. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes PA(A) is found to be reasonably described by the Weibull distribution

[formula]

with parameters [formula] and [formula] (Fig. 4(c)). The Weibull distribution appears in a wide range of problems, from the extreme statistics [\cite=gumbel] to the return-interval distributions in natural and social phenomena [\cite=return] and fractures in disordered media [\cite=fracture], which may provide clues for the mechanisms underlying the amplitude fluctuations.

Noise Propagation

Noise propagation refers to how the fluctuations of upstream reaction processes affect the fluctuation of the downstream processes, such as the effect of an mRNA number fluctuation on the corresponding protein number fluctuation [\cite=paulsson1] or that of a transcription factor number fluctuation on its regulated protein number fluctuation [\cite=propa]. Most studies on noise propagation so far have been concerned with a simple linear cascade [\cite=propa] or a simple autoregulated feedback structure [\cite=serrano1].

Here, we are interested in how the global noise, such as the oscillation period and amplitude fluctuations, propagates down the regulatory cascade. To this end, we plot in Fig. 5 successive oscillation periods and amplitudes for the first three steps. For immediately following periods, the periods are well correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.76; Fig. 5(b)). The correlation decreases monotonically (Figs. 5(c,d)), but not purely exponentially (Figs. 5(h,i)), leading to a correlation between two consecutive periods of the same protein number as high as r = 0.31. This means that the period fluctuation of a protein component does propagate down the regulatory cascade, and that the effect is strong enough not to be fully attenuated, not even after a complete feedback cycle. Thus, the oscillation dynamics of the repressilator exhibits a correlated pattern period-wise, even though the underlying reaction processes are assumed to be purely Poissonian.

Meanwhile, the oscillation amplitude correlations (Figs. 5(e-g)) are found to decay purely exponentially with the regulatory step number n as r(n)  ≈   exp ( - n / n*), with the characteristic step [formula], a much faster decay than that of the oscillation periods (Figs. 5(h,i)). This result implies that the oscillation amplitudes not only fluctuate more strongly individually but also are less tightly controlled along the system. Amplitude control in a stochastic oscillation system would be a more serious issue for robust functioning in this respect [\cite=autoregulatory].

Local Fluctuations

Around the overall oscillatory change, there are constant ups and downs in the protein number, resulting from the inherently stochastic reactions (inset of Fig. 6). This part of the fluctuation, which we call the local noise, can also affect the system's function as it introduces many local maxima and minima within a global oscillation period and provides a source of error in sensing the system's state. The degree of local noise strongly depends on the individual reaction rates [\cite=sasai1] [\cite=biham1] and, in general, anti-correlates with the stability measure. Here, we are again interested in the characteristics of local noise in the stable oscillation regime.

The general characteristics of the noise in protein number dynamics are encoded in its spectral density S(f), the squared magnitude of its (complex) Fourier component with frequency f. In particular, the high-frequency behavior of S(f) tells us about the local noise properties. In Fig. 6, we show the spectral density of the LacI protein number. There we can see a clear peak located at [formula] Hz corresponding to the primary oscillation frequency, in good agreement with the mean oscillation period in Fig. 4(b). This prominent peak is accompanied by additional peaks at integer multiples of f1 with decreasing height values. The frequency region [formula] Hz is dominated by the local noise, in which S(f) decreases algebraically with f as

[formula]

implying that the protein number locally performs an uncorrelated random walk around the overall oscillatory trajectory. This implies that in the stable oscillation regime, the global oscillatory dynamics of the repressilator is primarily brought about by a system-level long-range coordination of the reaction processes, with only a weak perturbation due to stochasticity.

Summary and Discussion

In this paper, we have studied the noise characteristics of stochastic (noisy) oscillations in the repressilator system for stable oscillation regime. Distinguishing the global and the local noises, we first found that even in this relatively loosely regulated system, the oscillation period is well controlled, fluctuating moderately as approximately a Gaussian with a CV value of 0.11, whereas the amplitudes fluctuate much strongly, with a Weibull distribution and a CV value of 0.43. Likewise, the period fluctuation of a protein species is attenuated more slowly down the regulatory cascade, leading to a correlated behavior in adjacent oscillation periods, a short-term collective memory, within the feedback cycle. The amplitude fluctuation, however, propagates much more weakly, with a characteristic step number of 1.8, less than the feedback cycle length. Finally, the local fluctuations entail an inverse-square spectral density at high frequencies, meaning that the protein number trajectory performs locally an uncorrelated random walk around the global oscillatory dynamics. Furthermore, we have checked that the overall noise characteristics do not change qualitatively when we run the repressilator for different parameter sets with varying degree of stability, or we consider other simple oscillator circuits based on negative feedback, such as the 3-component cyclic circuit with two activators and one repressor, supporting the generality of the results.

The repressilator is built with one of the simplest negative feedback structures capable of sustained oscillations. Oscillatory circuits functioning in real biological systems exhibit much more complex structures with multiple regulatory components, which might have evolved to ensure robust control and fine-tuning of the oscillatory activities. In this respect, we hope that the current work can be extended to systematic structural and dynamic studies towards the design principles of biological oscillatory networks including the stochastic effects [\cite=novak] [\cite=suel]. Indeed, our result that the oscillation amplitude fluctuates strongly even in the most stable oscillatory regime in the simple circuit may imply the intrinsic tunability of the simple oscillatory circuit [\cite=kaneko] on the one hand, but at the same time, it demands an improved oscillatory network design for robust and resilient oscillatory function. Areas of future research to this end would include, e.g., investigating the role of various regulatory mechanisms besides simple transcription-factor binding for noise control, especially for the oscillation amplitude [\cite=autoregulatory], and the effect of a molecular network on the stochastic dynamics [\cite=goh] [\cite=biham1] [\cite=vilar] [\cite=ghim]. Further insights into the stochastic dynamics of the biological oscillatory system could be gained by studies of more complex synthetic or natural circuits [\cite=hasty1] [\cite=mammalian] and of the theory of competition-based ecological systems [\cite=ecol] [\cite=cyclic].
