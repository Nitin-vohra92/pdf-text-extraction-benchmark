HII regions feeding the interstellar medium in M 83

Overview

In this study, we analyse the internal dynamics of star-forming H i i regions and their efficiency in interacting with the ambient interstellar medium. We have selected the nearby (4.5 Mpc) nearly face-on spiral galaxy M 83, and from GHαFaS [\citep=Hernandezetal2008] Fabry-Perot observations of the central [formula] region, extracted the integrated Hα emission-line profiles of a sample of 136 isolated H i i regions. We investigate the effect of the instrumental response and find that, although commonly this effect is subtracted quadratically [\citep=Rozasetal1998], the contribution of the instrument assuming Gaussian instrumental response is not adequate for deriving reliable emission line profiles. Instead, we convolve one Gaussian with the observed instrumental response before fitting the result to the line profile. Quadratic subtraction overestimates the Hα emission-line velocity dispersion by ≈  6- 1 (left panel in the figure). When performing the same study fitting two Gaussians, results show that the secondary component tends (> 80% of the cases) to be smaller and narrower, while the uncertainties in the determination of the parameters of both Gaussians increase by as much as a factor of three.

We investigate the relation between Luminosity and Hα Velocity dispersion σ (right panel), and reproduce the correlation found in previous studies [\citep=Relanoetal2005] [\citep=Rozasetal1998], however, due to the large scatter in the derived σ values, we find that the slope of the linear fit could vary between 2 and 5 depending on the minimisation strategy and assumptions about systematic errors caused by assumptions about the mean temperature and metallicity in H i i regions. Our goal is to study these effects and to quantify the energetic output from H i i regions, as well as estimate their age and evolution. A comprehensive analysis will appear in [\citep=Blascoetal2010].
