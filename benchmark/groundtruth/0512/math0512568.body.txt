For any commutative semigroup S with zero element 0, there is an undirected zero-divisor graph Γ(S) associated with S. The vertex set of Γ(S) is the set of all nonzero zero-divisors of S, and for distinct vertices x and y of Γ(S), there is an edge linking x and y if and only if xy = 0 ([\cite=FR]). In [\cite=FR] and [\cite=FL], some fundamental properties and possible structures of Γ(S) were studied. For example, for any semigroup S, it was proved that Γ(S) is a connected simple graph with diameter less than or equal to 3, that the core of Γ(S) is a union of triangles and squares while any vertex of Γ(S) is either an end vertex or in the core, if there exists a cycle in Γ(S), and that for any non-adjacent vertices x,y, there exists a vertex z such that [formula]. In [\cite=FL], the authors also provided a descending chain of ideals Ik of S, where Ik consists of all elements of S with vertex degree greater than or equal to k in Γ(S). These general structure results are very helpful when one studies the following general problem: Given a connected simple graph G, does there exist a semigroup S such that [formula]? Some classes of graphs were given in [\cite=FL] [\cite=FR],[\cite=WCH] [\cite=WULU] [\cite=ZWU] to give positive or negative answers to this problem. The zero-divisor graph was also extensively studied for commutative rings, see, e.g., [\cite=AL] [\cite=DF] [\cite=B] [\cite=AN] [\cite=M].

In this paper, we study some sub-semigroup structures of a zero-divisor semigroup by properties of the graph Γ(S). First we prove that if there is an vertex x such that the graph has three parts [formula], where Tx contains all end vertices adjacent to x such that there is no edge linking a vertex in Tx with a vertex in Cx, and that either Cx is non-empty or x is adjacent to at least one end vertex, then [formula] is a sub-semigroup of S. In particular, if x is adjacent to at least one end vertex and G has a cycle, then x2 = 0 or x2 = x. We also provide various conditions such that the end vertices adjacent to a single vertex together with 0 forms a sub-semigroup. For Boolean semigroups (i.e., semigroups with [formula]), we found a descending chain of sub-semigroups which in some sense is dual to the Ik mentioned above. As an application, we characterize the graphs which are zero-divisor graphs of Boolean rings. We also use these sub-semigroups to study the correspondence between semigroups and zero-divisor graphs. In particular, we construct a kind of graph G which has a unique corresponding zero-divisor semigroup, where the core of G is the union of a square and a triangle. Two vertices of G can be adjacent to arbitrarily many (finite or infinite) end vertices, while if one adds end vertices to the other three vertices, the resulting graph has no corresponding semigroups.

All semigroups in this paper are multiplicatively commutative zero-divisor semigroups with zero element 0, where 0x = 0 for all x∈S, and all graphs in this paper are undirected simple and connected. For a given connected simple graph G, if there exists a zero-divisor semigroup S such that [formula], then we say that G has corresponding semigroups, and we call S a semigroup determined by the graph G. For any vertices x,y in a graph G, if x and y are adjacent, we denote it as x - y or occasionally, x  ↔  y. A vertex is called an end vertex, if its vertex degree is one. The core of a graph G, which will be denoted as K(G), is the largest subgraph of G every edge of which is an edge of a cycle in G. We denote the complete graph with n end vertices by Kn. Similarly, we denote a complete bipartite graph with two parts of sizes m,n by Km,n.

Let S be a zero-divisor semigroup with graph G. Assume that for an element x of S, there exists a subset Tx of S - {0,x} satisfying the following conditions:

(1) Tx contains all end vertices adjacent to x.

(2) There is no edge linking a vertex in Tx with a vertex in [formula] when [formula].

(3) Either [formula], or G has a cycle and x is adjacent to at least one end vertex.

First assume that [formula]. Then by assumption (3), x is adjacent to at least one end vertex y∈Tx and x is in the core of G. By [\cite=FL], x2 is not an end vertex and in particular [formula]. In this case, T = S - Tx  =  {x,0} must be a sub-semigroup of S. In fact, if [formula] and [formula], then we have a path x2 - y - x, contradicting to the fact that y is an end vertex.

Now let us assume that [formula] is not empty. Then there is an element [formula] such that z - x. First let us consider xT. If for some t∈T, xt = y∈Tx, then we have a path z - y - x where [formula], contradicting with the condition (2). Thus we must have xT  ⊆  T. For any a∈T - {x}, we now proceed to prove aT  ⊆  T. Assume in the contrary that there is an element [formula] such that ab = y∈Tx. If a is not adjacent to x, then there is an element c∈T - {a,x} such that a - c. In this case there is a path c - y - x, where [formula], contradicting again with the condition (2). If a is adjacent to x, then by assumption (1), a is not an end vertex. Thus by condition (2) there is an element c∈T - {a,x} such that a - c. In this case, we also have a path c - y - x, where [formula]. In each case, there is a contradiction with the condition (2). These contradictions show that aT  ⊆  T. Finally, we obtain T2  ⊆  T and hence T is a sub-semigroup of S.   [formula]

Let S be a zero-divisor semigroup with graph G. For a vertex x of G, assume that Tx is nonempty and denote T = S - Tx, where Tx is the end vertices adjacent to x. Then T is a non-trivial sub-semigroup of S. If in addition G has a cycle, then {x,0} is a sub-semigroup of S.

When Tx is not empty, we have x∈T  ⊂  S. The set Tx of all end vertices adjacent to x certainly satisfies all conditions of Theorem 2.1. Thus the corollary follows from Theorem 2.1.  [formula]

For a vertex v of a connected graph G, if v is not an end vertex and there is no end vertex adjacent to v, then v is said to be an internal vertex of G. For an internal vertex v of a graph G and another graph H which is disjoint with G, we get a new graph by attaching the graph H to v, i.e., we add an edge linking v to every vertex of H.

If G is a graph which is not the graph of any semigroup and F is a graph obtained from G by attaching another graph to an internal vertex of G, then F is not the graph of any semigroup. In particular, if G is a graph which is not the graph of any semigroup and F is a graph obtained from G by adding some ends to internal vertices of G, then F is not the graph of any semigroup.

This follows immediately from Theorem 2.1.   [formula]

([\cite=WCH]) For any n  ≥  4, let Mn,k be the complete graph [formula] together with k end vertices {xi|1  ≤  i  ≤  k} such that ai - xi (n  ≥  k  ≥  4). Then Mn,k has no corresponding semigroups.

By [\cite=WULU], the graph Mn,3 has no corresponding semigroups. Since Mn,k is obtained by adding some end vertices to Mn,3, the result follows from Corollary 2.3.  [formula]

Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 are particularly powerful when the related graph has a unique corresponding zero-divisor semigroup, as is illustrated by the following examples.

By [\cite=WCH], the following graph G has a unique corresponding zero-divisor semigroup (The multiplication table is written on the right hand.):

[formula]

Now Let us consider graphs H obtained by adding some end vertices to some vertices of G. We have the following conclusions:

(1) Each of the following graphs has a unique zero-divisor semigroup:

[formula]

where both U and V consists of some end vertices.

(2) For other graphs H obtained by adding some end vertices to some vertices of G, H has no corresponding semigroups.

(i) Consider the following graphs:

[formula]

where U is nonempty and it consists of some end vertices. In each case, there exist non-adjacent vertices x,y such that for any z, [formula]. By [\cite=FL] and Theorem 2.1, only graphs of Fig. 1 may have semigroups.

(ii) Now consider the graphs H in Fig.1 and let us first assume [formula], and [formula]. For any u∈V, from

[formula]

we have x2u = x2, since x2u = a1 implies 0 = a1a3 = (a3x2)u = a1u by Corollary 2.2. Hence [formula], and a1 = a1x2 = a1u. Since

[formula]

we must have x1u = a2. This implies x1u2 = 0. Since [formula], we have either u2 = a1 or u2 = x2. But u2 = a1 implies that a1 = a1x2 = (ux2)u = x2u = x2, a contradiction. Thus we must have [formula]. Now that x1u = a2 implies x1(a3u) = 0, thus we must have a3u = a1, since otherwise one has a3u = x2, and this will imply a1x2 = 0. Finally, for any [formula], we conclude uv = x2. In fact, since uv∈ann(a2), [formula]. If uv = a1, then a1 = a1u = u2v = x2v = x2. If uv = a2, then 0 = a2u = u2v = x2. If uv = a3, then 0 = (a1u)v = a1. If uv = u, then 0 = ua2 = u(vx1) = ux1 = a2. These contradictions show that uv = x2.

By Corollary 2.2, The graph H in Fig.1 uniquely determines the multiplication table on [formula]. The final work is to verify that the table defines an associative binary operation on S. This is really the case. In the following Tab.1, we list the table for [formula] with |V| = 2.

[formula]

(iii) Now assume U = {ui  |  1  ≤  i  ≤  r}, V = {vj  |  1  ≤  j  ≤  s} and [formula]. By Corollary 2.2, we need only to determine the value of uv for any u∈U,v∈V. Since

[formula]

we must have uv = a3. In fact, if uv = a1, then 0 = x1a1 = (x1v)u = a2u, a contradiction. Finally, it is routine to test the associative law. Below we list the table for U = {u1,u2},V = {v1,v2} and this will end the proof:

[formula]

[formula]

The following graph has corresponding semigroups:

[formula]

where U,V and W consist of end vertices.

For U = {x1,u},V = {x2,v},W = {x3,w}, the following associative table defines a semigroup whose zero-divisor graph is isomorphic to the graph of Fig.4:

[formula]

[formula]

Let G be the graph of a semigroup S and assume that G has a cycle. For a vertex x of the graph G which is not an end vertex, let Tx be the end vertices adjacent to x. Then [formula] is a sub-semigroup of S, if [formula].

For any u,v∈Tx with [formula], obviously [formula] since [formula] If uv = c is not an end vertex of G, then it is in the core of G since the graph G has a cycle. Then there exists another vertex [formula] in the core such that x - c - d. Then from 0 = dc = (du)v, we obtain du = x by [\cite=FL]. But then we have x2 = d(xu) = 0, a contradiction. Thus uv must be an end vertex and hence uv∈Tx.   [formula]

We remark that the condition of [formula] could not be dropped from Proposition 2.7.

Consider the semigroup S = {0,a1,a2,a3,x1} with the multiplication table

[formula]

Obviously [formula] is not a sub-semigroup of S.  [formula]

Let G be the graph of a semigroup S. Let s,t be two vertices of G such that [formula] and that s2 = 0,t2 = 0, where Ts is the end vertices adjacent to s. Then the following conclusions hold:

(1) [formula] and sS = {0,s},tS = {0,t}.

(2) If one of the following conditions holds, then [formula] is a reduced sub-semigroup of S: (I) [formula], where K(G) is the core of G. (II) The edge s - t is not contained in any quadrilaterals.

(1) Let us first show that [formula]. Assume that y∈Ts,x∈Tt, and consider the following

[formula]

Since [formula], The value of xy has only three possibilities, i.e., [formula].

If xy = s, then we have [formula], and hence [formula]. Since 0 = ts = (ty)x, we have ty = t. Thus ty2 = t and hence [formula]. On the other hand, we have 0 = sy = xy2 and thus y2 = t. Finally, we have t2 = ty2 = ty = t, contradicting with the assumption. Thus [formula]. By symmetry, we also have [formula]. Thus we must have [formula]. In this case we have [formula] since [formula]. Similarly we also have [formula]. Therefore sS = ann(y) = {0,s}, and tS = (x) = {0,t}. In particular, we have sx = s and ty = t.

(2) Now we show that [formula] is a reduced sub-semigroup of S. For any y∈Ts, we already know that [formula] by case 3. Now assume [formula]. Then we have td = ty2 = t, thus td2 = t and hence [formula]. Hence [formula]. Also [formula], since c - t but d is not adjacent to t. If condition (I) holds, then we know that d = y2∈Ts is an end vertex. If condition (II) holds, then d must be an end vertex adjacent to s, since otherwise we have another vertex h∈K(G) such that [formula] and d - h. In this case, we have a square s - d - h - t - s, a contradiction to the assumption (II).

For distinct elements y,z∈Ts, obviously [formula]. If d = s, then 0 = sz = z2y. Then either z2 = y or z2 - y, contradictions. Thus [formula] always holds. Now assume [formula]. First assume that the condition (I) holds. Since 0 = (sy)z, we must have [formula]. If d is not an end vertex, then 0 = d2 = (dy)z. Thus dy = s, which implies dy2 = sy = 0. Then we have d - y2 - s, contradicting to the fact that y2 is an end vertex. In the other case we assume that the condition (I) holds. In this case, we also have dt = t. Thus if [formula], then there exists an h∈G(K) such that [formula] and hd = 0. Then we will obtain a square s - d - h - t - s, contradicting with the assumption (II) again. Finally, in each case, we have yz∈Ts. Thus [formula] is a reduced sub-semigroup of S.  [formula]

For any 1  ≤  m  ≤  |V(G)|, the graph G is said to be m-uniquely determined (by neighborhoods), if for any x,y∈V(G) with |N(x)| = |N(y)| = m, N(x) = N(y) implies x = y.

Let G be the graph of a finite zero-divisor semigroup S. Let s be a vertex of G with the greatest degree m. Assume that G is m-uniquely determined and s2 = s. Then {s,0} is an ideal of S.

For any x∈S with [formula], we have [formula]. Thus N(s)  ⊆  N(sx) and hence N(s) = N(sx). By assumption, we obtain sx = s. This shows that Ss  ⊆  {s,0}.   [formula]

Recall that a ring R (a semigroup R) is called a Boolean ring (a Boolean semigroup), if [formula]. It is easy to see that vertices of the zero-divisor graph Γ(R) of a Boolean ring R are uniquely determined by their neighborhoods, i.e., N(x) = N(y) only if x = y for any vertices of Γ(R) ([\cite=LUWU]), where N(x) = {y∈Γ(R)  |  y - x} is the neighbors of x in Γ(R). However, this result does not hold for general Boolean semigroups.

([\cite=ZWU]) There exists an Boolean semigroup S such that Γ(S) is a complete r-partite graph. The vertices of this Γ(S) are not uniquely determined by their neighborhoods when r > 1 and at least one part of Γ(R) contains more than one vertices.

In fact, Let [formula] be a disjoint union of r + 1 nonempty subsets, where Ai  =  {aiki  |  1  ≤  ki  ≤  mi}. Define a2iki = aiki, airais = ai1 ([formula]), aikajl = 0 ([formula]). Then S is a commutative zero-divisor semigroup whose zero-divisor graph Γ(S) is the complete r-partite graph. Obviously, S is a Boolean semigroup.  [formula]

For any zero-divisor semigroup S, define an equivalent relation ~   in S* in the following natural way:

x  ~  y if and only if N(x) = N(y).

For any [formula], denote by [formula] the equivalent class containing x. Assume S* has me classes.

Let S be a Boolean semigroup with zero-element 0.

(1) Then Sx is a sub-semigroup of S, and [formula].

(2) Let [formula]. Then [formula] is a sub-semigroup of S, [formula] and Sx is an ideal of [formula].

(1) For any [formula], if N(y) = N(x) = N(z), then obviously [formula], and N(x)  ⊆  N(xy) since [formula]. Now for any u∈N(xy), we have [formula]. If [formula], then [formula]. Therefore xu∈N(y) = N(x), and hence xu = x2u = 0, a contradiction. Thus we must have N(xy)  ⊆  N(x) and hence N(x) = N(xy). This shows that [formula]. Since N(z) = N(x) = N(xy) = N(y), we have N(x) = N(xyz) = N(yz). Thus yz∈Sx. Thus Sx is a sub-semigroup of S.

(2) For any [formula], if xy = 0, then x∈N(y) but [formula], contradicting with the assumption of N(y)  ⊆  N(x). Thus [formula]. Since x2 = x, we have [formula], and therefore N(x)  ⊆  N(xy). Conversely, for any u∈N(xy), we have [formula]. If [formula], then [formula]. Thus ux∈N(y)  ⊆  N(x), and hence ux = ux2 = 0, a contradiction. Thus we also have N(xy)  ⊆  N(x). This shows that N(x) = N(xy). Now if [formula], then we have N(yz)  ⊆  N(xyz) = N(x) and hence [formula]. This shows that [formula] is a sub-semigroup of S, [formula] and Sx is an ideal of [formula].   [formula]

For any Boolean semigroup S with zero-element 0, the zero-divisor graph Γ(S) is uniquely determined if and only if N(y)  ⊆  N(x) implies [formula].

[formula] If N(x) = N(y), then x = xy = y.

[formula] If N(y)  ⊆  N(x), then by the proof of Theorem 3.2, we have N(xy) = N(x). If Γ(S) is uniquely determined, then we obtain xy = x.   [formula]

As an application of Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.3, we obtain the following results which should be compared with Example 3.1:

For any n  ≥  3, each connected subgraph G of the complete graph Kn + 1 containing the complete graph Kn has a unique zero-divisor Boolean semigroup if [formula].

Assume that there exists a Boolean semigroup S such that Γ(S) = G. Assume S - {0} = V(G). We only prove the following case. Assume that G is the complete graph Kn  =  {ai  |  1  ≤  i  ≤  n} together with an end vertex x1, where a1 - x1. Since N(x1)  ⊆  N(ai) ([formula]), by Theorem 3.2(2) we obtain N(ai) = N(aix1). Since G is uniquely determined by neighborhoods, we have ai = aix1. Thus we have a unique associative multiplication table on the vertices of G such that Γ(S) = G. Notice that G is uniquely determined by neighborhoods if and only if the degree of x1 is not n - 1. When the degree of x1 is n - 1, the graph G has multiple corresponding Boolean semigroups such that [formula].   [formula]

Recall that a two-star graph is a graph consists of two star graphs with exactly one edge connecting the two centers. By [\cite=FR], the two-star graphs and their connected subgraphs are all the possible zero-divisor graphs of semigroups that contains no cycle.

The following graphs have no Boolean semigroups:

(1) The complete graph Kn together with more than one end vertices (n  ≥  4).

(2) The complete bipartite graph Km,n together with end vertices (m,n  ≥  2).

(3) Any two star graph which is not a star graph.

Assume that there exists a Boolean semigroup S such that Γ(S) = G.

(1) and (2). Now assume G is the complete bipartite graph

[formula]

together with an end vertex x1, where a1 - x1 (m,n  ≥  2). Obviously, a1a2 = a1. Now consider a2x1. If a2x1 = a1, then a21 = 0. Thus a2x1 = ak for some [formula]. But then we have [formula]. The negative results of other cases follows from [\cite=WULU] and [\cite=WCH].

(3) Assume that [formula], where [formula]. If [formula] is a Boolean semigroup such that Γ(S) = G, then by Theorem 3.2(2) we have x1b = b,y1a = a since N(x1)  ⊆  N(b),N(y1)  ⊆  N(a). Then we have 0 = by1 = (x1y1)b and 0 = ax1 = (x1y1)a. Thus we obtain

[formula]

which is obviously impossible.   [formula]

Recall that a semigroup S is called a reduced semigroup, if there exist no nonzero nilpotent elements in S.

For a reduced zero-divisor semigroup S, if the graph Γ(S) is uniquely determined, then S is a Boolean semigroup.

For any [formula], obviously N(x)  ⊆  N(x2). Conversely, if u∈N(x2), then we have (ux)2 = 0. Thus [formula] and ux = 0. Thus N(x2)  ⊆  N(x).   [formula]

Recall that a Boolean algebra is a distributive complemented lattice with the smallest element 0 and the largest element 1. Recall from [\cite=DF] that a graph G is called complemented, if for each vertex x of G, there exists a vertex y such that [formula], i.e., [formula] and the edge x - y is not part of any triangle. G is called uniquely complemented, if G is complemented and whenever [formula] and [formula], then N(y) = N(z). Following [\cite=LUWU], a simple graph G is called a Boolean graph, if G is the zero-divisor graph of some Boolean ring. By [\cite=LUWU], a Boolean graph with more than two vertices has a unique corresponding zero-divisor semigroup and a unique corresponding ring. In the final part of this paper, we use Theorem 3.2 to give a characterization of Boolean graphs.

A simple connected graph G is a Boolean graph if and only if the following conditions hold:

(1) The graph G is uniquely determined.

(2) The graph G is uniquely complemented.

(3) For any x,y∈V(G) with [formula], there exists some z∈V(G) such that [formula].

(4) The graph G has a corresponding Boolean semigroup.

Proof. [formula]. It is obvious.

[formula]. By (4), we can assume that [formula] is a Boolean semigroup. Denote [formula] and V(G) by N(1) and N(0) respectively. Set [formula] and let P(G) = {N(x)|x∈R}. Then P(G) has a natural partial order. First we show that [formula]. Let [formula] such that [formula]. If [formula], then [formula]. By the previous Corollary 3.3, we have z = zx = zy and so z = zxy = xy, N(z) = N(xy). If xy = 0 and [formula], then we have z = zx = zy and thus z = z(xy) = 0, a contradiction. Thus in each case, we have [formula]. Second we define [formula]. By condition (3), P(G) becomes a lattice. We claim that P(G) is a distributive lattice. In fact, it suffice to prove that

[formula]

Of course, we have [formula] Conversely, let [formula] and assume [formula]. Then txz = 0 and tyz = 0. So [formula] and it follows that tzk = 0. This implies that [formula], proving the claim. By condition (3), we already know that P(G) is a Boolean algebra. In the following we denote by [formula] the complement of N(x).

Clearly, there is a multiplication operation on R. Define an addition +   on R as follows: Given x,y∈R, then there is a unique z∈R such that

[formula]

We then define x + y = z. It is routine to verify that R is a Boolean ring and that Γ(R) = G. This completes the proof.  [formula]
