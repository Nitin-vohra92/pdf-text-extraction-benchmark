Löwner equations and Dispersionless Hierarchies

Introduction

Recently reductions and hodograph solutions of dispersionless/Whitham type integrable systems are intensively studied[\cite=gib-tsa:99] [\cite=yu-gib:00] [\cite=m-a-m:02] [\cite=g-m-a:03]. In this article we report another example; reduction of the dispersionless coupled modified KP (dcmKP) hierarchy to the (radial) Löwner equation.

The dcmKP hierarchy introduced by Teo[\cite=teo:03-1] is an extension of the dispersionless mKP hierarchy[\cite=tak:02] with an additional degree of freedom, or in other words, a "half" of the dispersionless Toda lattice hierarchy[\cite=tak-tak:91] [\cite=tak-tak:95].

The Löwner equation was introduced by K. Löwner[\cite=loe:23] in an attempt to solve the Bieberbach conjecture. It is an evolution equation of the conformal mapping from (a chain of) subdomains of the unit disk onto the unit disk. We can also define the same kind of equation with different normalization which is called the " chordal Löwner equation". See Lawler, Schramm and Werner[\cite=l-s-w:01] .3 for details. The original Löwner equation is, therefore, often called the " radial Löwner equation".

The reduction of the dispersionless KP hierarchy[\cite=dkp] [\cite=tak-tak:92] [\cite=tak-tak:95] to the chordal Löwner equation (and its generalization) has been studied by Gibbons and Tsarev[\cite=gib-tsa:99], Yu and Gibbons[\cite=yu-gib:00], Mañas, Martínez Alonso and Medina[\cite=m-a-m:02] and others. Our question is: how about the radial Löwner equation? The answer is that there appears another degree of freedom and the resulting system turns out to be the dcmKP hierarchy.

In the following two sections we review the two ingredients, the Löwner equation and the dcmKP hierarchy. The main result is presented in the last section. Details including proofs will be published in the forthcoming paper.

Radial Löwner equation

In this section we review the (radial) Löwner equation and introduce related notions. Since we are interested in algebro-analytic nature of the system, we omit reality/positivity conditions which are essential in the context of the complex analysis.

The Löwner equation is a system of differential equations for a function

[formula]

where [formula] and z are independent variables. In the complex analysis the variable z moves in a subdomain of the compliment of the unit disk and the variables λi parametrize the subdomain. In our context [formula] is considered as a generating function of the unknown functions [formula] and [formula]. We assume that for each [formula] a driving function [formula] is given. The Löwner equation is the following system:

[formula]

(The original Löwner equation[\cite=loe:23] is the case N = 1.)

Later the inverse function of [formula] with respect to the z-variable will be more important than g itself. We denote it by [formula]:

[formula]

It satisfies [formula] and [formula], from which we can determine the coefficients [formula] in terms of [formula] and [formula]. The Löwner equation [\eqref=r-loewner:g] is rewritten as the equation for [formula] as follows:

[formula]

This equation leads to the compatibility condition of κi's:

[formula]

for any i,j (i  ≠  j).

The Faber polynomials are defined as follows[\cite=teo:03-2]:

[formula]

Here (  ·  )≥  0 is the truncation of the Laurent series in w to its polynomial part.

dcmKP hierarchy

We give a formulation of the dcmKP hierarchy different from Teo[\cite=teo:03-1]. The equivalence (up to a gauge factor) will be explained in the forthcoming paper.

The independent variables of the system is (s,x,t) where [formula] is a series of infinitely many variables. The variables x and t1 appear in the equations only as the combination x + t1, so we often omit x. Namely, "t1" should be understood as the abbreviation of x + t1. The unknown functions φ(s,t) and un(s,t) ([formula]) are encapsulated in the series

[formula]

where w is a formal variable. The dispersionless coupled modified KP hierarchy (dcmKP hierarchy) is the following system of differential equations:

[formula]

Here the Poisson bracket {,} is defined by

[formula]

and Bn is the polynomial in w defined by

[formula]

where (  ·  )> 0 is the positive power part in w and (  ·  )0 is the constant term with respect to w.

It is easy to construct a theory for this system similar to those for the dispersionless KP hierarchy or the dispersionless Toda hierarchy[\cite=tak-tak:95].

Main results

In this section we show that a specialization of the variables [formula] in [formula] gives a solution of the dcmKP hierarchy.

Suppose [formula] satisfies the equations

[formula]

where [formula] are defined by

[formula]

They satisfy the equations

[formula]

where

[formula]

The hydrodynamic type equations [\eqref=lambda(s] [\eqref=t)] can be solved by the generalized hodograph method of Tsarev[\cite=tsa:91]: Let [formula] be functions satisfying

[formula]

Then the hodograph relation

[formula]

determines the solution of [\eqref=lambda(s] [\eqref=t)], [formula], as the implicit function.

Our main result is as follows: let [formula] be a solution of the radial Löwner equation [\eqref=r-loewner:f] of the form [\eqref=f(lambda;w)] and [formula] be a solution of [\eqref=lambda(s] [\eqref=t)]. Then the function L  =  L(s,t;w) defined by

[formula]

is a solution of the dcmKP hierarchy [\eqref=dcmkp].

In the proof we construct the S-function[\cite=tak-tak:91] [\cite=tak-tak:95], following the method by Mañas-Alonso-Medina[\cite=m-a-m:02].

If we start from the chordal Löwner equation instead of the radial Löwner equation, we obtain a solution of the dispersionless KP hierarchy. This is due to Gibbons and Tsarev[\cite=gib-tsa:99], Yu and Gibbons[\cite=yu-gib:00], Mañas, Martínez Alonso and Medina[\cite=m-a-m:02]. The generalization to the Whitham hierarchies is considered by Guil, Mañas and Martínez Alonso[\cite=g-m-a:03]. Note that their generalization does not contain the radial Löwner case, because of the normalization at the infinity.
