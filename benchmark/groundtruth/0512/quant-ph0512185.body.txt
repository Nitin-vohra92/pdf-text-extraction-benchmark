New multiplicativity results for qubit maps

Introduction and statement of results

Qubit maps provide a useful laboratory for exploring methods and conjectures in quantum information theory. In particular they can serve as a testing ground for approaches to the problem of additivity of minimal entropy, and the related issues of Holevo capacity and entanglement of formation [\cite=Shor]. In this paper we will focus on the maximal p-norm and consider the question of its multiplicativity for a product map, when one of the factors in the product is a qubit map. For values of p close to one this question is directly related to the additivity of minimal entropy, and hence to the circle of problems mentioned above.

Recall first that the Schatten norm of a matrix A is defined for p  ≥  1 as

[formula]

Let Φ be a linear map on the matrix algebra [formula], then the maximal p-norm of Φ is defined as

[formula]

where the first sup  runs over states in [formula], the second sup  runs over pure states (normalized vectors in [formula]), and the second equality follows by convexity of the p-norm. It is natural to define another norm ||Φ||1  →  p by instead taking the sup  over all matrices A satisfying ||A||1  =  1, and this has been considered in other work [\cite=Wat] [\cite=DJKR]; however for the applications in this paper we are interested only in the quantity defined in ([\ref=def:max-p]). In the case d = 2 we will refer to Φ as a qubit map.

Recall that the map Φ is positivity-preserving if Φ(A)  ≥  0 for every A  ≥  0, and trace-preserving if [formula]. The map is completely positive (CP) if in addition [formula] is positivity-preserving for every dimension d'. A channel is a CP, trace-preserving map.

Amosov and Holevo [\cite=AH] conjectured that the maximal p-norm is multiplicative for products of channels, that is for any channels Φ and Ω and for all p  ≥  1

[formula]

Later Holevo and Werner [\cite=WH] found a family of d-dimensional channels Ψ for which [formula] for p sufficiently large ([formula] for d = 3). No such example is known for d = 2, and the original conjecture ([\ref=AH-conj1]) survives for the case where at least one of the channels Φ, Ω is a qubit channel.

In our main result we prove ([\ref=AH-conj1]) for the case where Φ is a trace-preserving, positivity-preserving qubit map, where Ω is any finite-dimensional completely positive map, and where p = 2 or p  ≥  4. We do not assume that Φ is completely positive. Indeed it is essential for our proof that we consider the larger class of positivity-preserving but not completely positive maps. Previous work on entrywise positive maps [\cite=KNR] has provided other examples where multiplicativity holds for a class of non-CP maps, in the range p  ≥  2.

Let Φ be a trace-preserving, positivity-preserving qubit map, and Ω any finite-dimensional completely positive map. Then for p = 2 and for all p  ≥  4,

[formula]

There has been a lot of work on the additivity and multiplicativity question for quantum channels, and ([\ref=equal1]) has been established for special classes of qubit channels, including the depolarizing channel [\cite=BFMP] [\cite=AHW] [\cite=FH] [\cite=A1], unital qubit channels [\cite=KR1] [\cite=Ki1], and some classes of non-unital qubit channels [\cite=Ki2] [\cite=Ki3] [\cite=ShorEBT] [\cite=Fu]. Theorem [\ref=thm1] settles the question of multiplicativity for all qubit channels, at least in the range p  ≥  4 (the case p  =  2 was proved in [\cite=Ki2]). It should be noted that ([\ref=equal1]) is false in general for positivity-preserving qubit maps if p  <  2, as can be seen with the example [formula] where Φ(ρ)  =  ρT. We are not aware of any counterexamples to ([\ref=equal1]) for 2  <  p  <  4.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] uses the following matrix inequality which is of independent interest.

Let [formula] for some d  ≥  1. Then for p = 2 and for all p  ≥  4,

[formula]

The inequality ([\ref=inequal1]) was first derived by M. Nathanson [\cite=MN]. It had been known previously in the cases where A = D and B = C [\cite=BCL], where [formula] is positive semidefinite [\cite=Ki3], and where all matrices A,B,C,D are diagonal [\cite=KN]. We conjecture that the inequality holds in the interval 2  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , and that the reverse inequality holds in the interval 1  ≤  p  ≤  2 (it is easy to see that equality holds at p = 2). Proving this conjecture would also establish the non-commutative version of Hanner's inequality [\cite=BCL].

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] for a special sub-class of qubit maps, making use of the inequality ([\ref=inequal1]). In Section 3 we recall a result of Gorini and Sudarshan [\cite=GS] on the classification of extreme affine maps on [formula] which map the unit ball into itself. Combining the Gorini-Sudarshan classification with the representation of qubit maps as affine maps on [formula], we derive Lemma [\ref=lem2], which implies that any trace-preserving, positivity-preserving qubit map Φ can be expressed as a convex combination of qubit maps from the sub-class of Section 2, all of which share the same maximal output p-norm as Φ. Using Lemma [\ref=lem2], we then prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] for all qubit maps. Section 4 contains the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2], which makes use of previously known matrix inequalities [\cite=Ki3].

Proof for special class of maps

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] for a special class of positivity-preserving, trace-preserving qubit maps. In order to describe this class we will use the representation of qubit states by points in the Bloch sphere, and qubit maps by affine linear maps on [formula].

A qubit state ρ is represented by a point in the unit ball in [formula] via the relation

[formula]

where I is the identity matrix and {σ1,σ2,σ3} are the Pauli matrices. Positivity of ρ is equivalent to

[formula]

A trace-preserving qubit map Φ sends the state [formula] to the state [formula], where [formula] is obtained from x by applying an affine linear map, that is

[formula]

for some real 3  ×  3 matrix A, and some vector [formula].

Conjugation by a unitary matrix U∈SU(2) maps ρ to UρU*, and this acts on the Bloch sphere by a rotation, sending x  ↦  R(U)x for some R(U)∈SO(3). If unitary conjugations by matrices U,V are performed on the domain and range of the map Φ respectively, then the representation ([\ref=def:affine]) is replaced by

[formula]

Since the map U  ↦  R(U) is onto, the singular value decomposition implies that it is always possible to find unitary matrices U,V so that R(V)AR(U) is diagonal (though the diagonal entries need not be all positive). Spectral properties of the map Φ (in particular its maximal output p-norm) are invariant under unitary conjugations in its domain and range, hence there is no loss of generality in assuming that the matrix A in ([\ref=def:affine]) is diagonal. Using the representation ([\ref=def:affine]), we will say that Φ is in diagonal form if

[formula]

Note that Φ is unital if and only if v  =  0 in ([\ref=def:affine]). We now prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] for a special class of maps.

Let Φ be a positivity-preserving, trace-preserving qubit map in diagonal form ([\ref=diag-form]), and suppose that at most one of the numbers (v1,v2,v3) is nonzero. Then ([\ref=equal1]) holds for any completely positive map Ω, for p = 2 and for p  ≥  4.

Proof: By permuting coordinates we can assume that only the third component of v can be nonzero, so that v1  =  v2  =  0. The diagonal entries of A may be positive or negative. However we can change the signs of any two diagonal entries by conjugating with a Pauli matrix, without destroying the diagonal property and without changing the third diagonal entry; for example conjugating with σ3 changes the signs of λ1 and λ2, and leaves λ3 unchanged. Using this additional freedom we can assume that

[formula]

Let ρ12 be a bipartite state on [formula] for some d, written in block form

[formula]

Let Ω be a completely positive map on [formula], then

[formula]

where A  =  Ω(X), B  =  Ω(Y) and C  =  Ω(Z). Since Ω is completely positive, and ρ12 is a state, it follows that [formula] is positive semidefinite, and hence B  =  A1 / 2RC1 / 2 where R is a contraction. This implies in particular that for all p  ≥  1

[formula]

We will encounter the 2  ×  2 matrices of p-norms

[formula]

and we note now that ([\ref=2x2-pos]) implies the positivity of these matrices, or more generally

[formula]

for any [formula] satisfying |z|  ≤  1.

Using the diagonal form ([\ref=diag-form]) and the assumption that v3 is the only nonzero component of v, we have

[formula]

where B  =  B1  -  iB2 with B1,B2 hermitian, and where

[formula]

Since Φ is positivity-preserving, it maps the state [formula] into a positive semidefinite matrix, and this implies that

[formula]

Similarly it maps the state [formula] to a positive semidefinite matrix, hence also

[formula]

The case p = 2

Using the representation ([\ref=mat1]),

[formula]

Using the positivity of the coefficients ([\ref=cpos1]), ([\ref=cpos2]) and convexity of the 2-norm gives

[formula]

Define

[formula]

then it follows that

[formula]

Using ([\ref=B-ineq]) the right side of ([\ref=mat1.1]) can be re-written as the trace squared of a 2  ×  2 matrix, leading to

[formula]

where

[formula]

As noted in ([\ref=pos-later]) the matrix [formula] is positive semidefinite, hence by definition of the maximal 2-norm we get

[formula]

Since A  =  Ω(X) and C  =  Ω(Z), this yields

[formula]

since [formula]. Since this holds for any state ρ12 we deduce that

[formula]

The inequality in the reverse direction follows by restriction to product states, hence this completes the proof for the case p = 2.

The case p  ≥  4

We apply Theorem [\ref=thm2] to ([\ref=mat1]) to conclude that for p  ≥  4,

[formula]

Define the 2  ×  2 real symmetric matrix

[formula]

so that ([\ref=mat2]) can be written

[formula]

The positivity results ([\ref=cpos1]) and ([\ref=cpos2]) imply that

[formula]

Furthermore, recall ([\ref=def-lambda]) and suppose first that λ  =  λ1, so that λ1  -  λ2  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

where in the last inequality we used [formula]. A similar argument leads to the same conclusion if λ  =  λ2.

We would like to replace the entries of M with the bounds on the right sides of ([\ref=cpos3]) and ([\ref=bound-B]), and argue that ||M||p must increase under this substitution. However the matrix M may not be positive semidefinite (since Φ is not necessarily completely positive) so this is not immediately obvious. To see that it does in fact increase, let p  =  2q so that

[formula]

Then the matrix M2  =  M*M is positive semidefinite with positive entries, and it is easy to see that this implies ||M2||q is an increasing function of the entries of M2. Since M is also entrywise positive, the entries of M2 are increasing functions of the entries of M, and therefore so is ||M2||q. Therefore ||M||p increases when the bounds ([\ref=cpos3]), ([\ref=bound-B]) are inserted in the right side of ([\ref=mat2.5]), and we get

[formula]

Now we note that the right side of ([\ref=mat4]) is unchanged if the upper-right entry λ||B||p is replaced by zλ||B||p and the lower left entry by z*λ||B||p for any |z|  =  1. Hence using the notation ([\ref=def-z]) again, ([\ref=mat4]) implies

[formula]

We now repeat the arguments used above in the case p = 2, to conclude that

[formula]

Since this holds for any state ρ12 we again deduce

[formula]

and this completes the proof for the case p  ≥  4.

Reduction to special form

In this section we will show that the general case of Theorem [\ref=thm1] follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma1]. Recall that a trace-preserving, positivity-preserving qubit map Φ is represented by an affine linear map on [formula] as in ([\ref=def:affine]), sending the Bloch sphere (the closed unit ball in [formula]) into an ellipsoid. We will refer to the latter as the image ellipsoid of Φ.

For a positivity-preserving, trace-preserving qubit map Φ, the minimal output entropy and maximal output p-norm are all achieved on the same input state. That is, there is a pure state |ψ〉 such that for all p  ≥  1

[formula]

Define the function

[formula]

The spectrum of Φ(|ψ〉〈ψ|) is {(1  ±  r) / 2}, for some 0  ≤  r  ≤  1. Accordingly the value of ([\ref=def:p-max1]) is

[formula]

We will denote by Cr the set of all positivity-preserving, trace-preserving qubit maps whose maximal output p-norm is at most hp(r), that is

[formula]

Note that Cr does not depend on p. Geometrically, Cr consists of the positivity-preserving qubit maps for which the image ellipsoid lies inside the sphere of radius r centered at the origin.

It is clear that Cr is a convex set. The next result shows that the extreme points of Cr have a simple form. Recall the definition ([\ref=diag-form]) of the diagonal form of a qubit map.

Let Φ be an extreme point in Cr, represented in diagonal form by the affine map x  ↦  Ax  +  v on [formula]. Then at most one of the components of v is nonzero.

Lemma [\ref=lem2] is a consequence of the following Theorem of Gorini and Sudarshan [\cite=GS], which classifies all extreme affine maps of [formula] sending the closed unit ball into itself.

Let Dn be the set of affine maps of [formula] which send the closed unit ball into itself. Denote by (B,w) the map x  ↦  Bx  +  w, where [formula] and [formula]. If (B,w) is an extreme point in Dn, then there are orthogonal matrices Q1,Q2∈O(n), and real numbers 0  ≤  κ  ≤  1, 0  <  δ  ≤  1 such that

[formula]

where [formula] and where [formula] denotes the diagonal matrix with entries [formula].

To derive Lemma [\ref=lem2] from Theorem [\ref=thmGS], we identify Cr with the set of scaled affine maps rD3  =  {(rB,rw)  :  (B,w)∈D3}. Hence every extreme map Φ in Cr corresponds to an affine map (rB,rw) where (B,w) satisfies ([\ref=GS1]). Furthermore the matrix Q1 in ([\ref=GS1]) is in O(3), and hence either Q1∈SO(3) or -  Q1∈SO(3); similarly for Q2. Since every rotation in SO(3) can be implemented by a unitary conjugation in SU(2) (see the discussion leading up to ([\ref=def:affine2])), this shows that Φ can be written in diagonal form with

[formula]

and this proves Lemma [\ref=lem2].

In the remainder of this section we will show that Theorem [\ref=thm1] follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma1] and Lemma [\ref=lem2]. Accordingly, suppose that Φ is a trace-preserving, positivity-preserving qubit map satisfying ([\ref=eval:p-max]) for some 0  ≤  r  ≤  1, so that

[formula]

Then it is sufficient to show that for any completely positive map Ω,

[formula]

Now Cr is a closed bounded convex subset of [formula] (since the matrix A and vector v together have 12 entries), hence by Caratheodory's Theorem any element of Cr can be written as a convex combination of at most 13 of its extreme points. The map Φ is in Cr, hence there are extreme maps {Φi}∈Cr such that

[formula]

where ai  ≥  0 and [formula]. Since {Φi} are in Cr we also have

[formula]

Furthermore, combining Lemma [\ref=lem2] and Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we deduce that

[formula]

for all i. By convexity of the p-norm it follows from ([\ref=sum1]) and ([\ref=ext-case]) that

[formula]

and this proves ([\ref=suff1]).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]

Let p  =  2q and define

[formula]

Then M*M is positive semidefinite, and we write it in block form as

[formula]

Now we apply the result of Theorem 1(b) from [\cite=Ki3] to the matrix M*M to deduce that

[formula]

for all q  ≥  2. Furthermore M11  =  A*A  +  C*C, hence

[formula]

Similarly

[formula]

and

[formula]

For a positive semidefinite 2  ×  2 matrix the q-norm is an increasing function of the entries. Hence combining ([\ref=q-bound]) with ([\ref=m11]), ([\ref=m12]), ([\ref=m22]) gives

[formula]

where

[formula]

Taking a square root of both sides gives

[formula]

which is the stated result.
