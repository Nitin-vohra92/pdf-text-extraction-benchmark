On the conformal systoles of four-manifolds

Introduction

There are several notions of systolic invariants for Riemannian manifolds, which were introduced by M. Berger and M. Gromov (see [\cite=G] and [\cite=B] [\cite=CK] for an overview). The most basic concept is the k-systole k(X,g) of a Riemannian manifold X, defined as the infimum over the volumes of all cycles representing non-zero classes in [formula]. In this note we discuss a different systole, namely the conformal systole, which depends only on the conformal class of the Riemannian metric. We briefly review its definition (see Section [\ref=def] for details).

Let (X2n,g) be a closed oriented even dimensional Riemannian manifold. The Riemannian metric defines an L2-norm on the space of harmonic n-forms on X and hence induces a norm on the middle-dimensional cohomology [formula]. The conformal n-systole n(X,g) is the smallest norm of a non-zero element in the integer lattice [formula] in [formula]. It is known that for a fixed manifold X the conformal n-systoles are bounded from above as g varies over all Riemannian metrics. Hence the supremum CS(X) =  sup gn(X,g) of the conformal systoles over all metrics g is a finite number, which is a priori a diffeomorphism invariant of X.

The interest in the literature has been to find bounds for CS(X) that depend only on the topology of X, e.g. the Euler characteristic of X, where X runs over some class of manifolds. In [\cite=BS] P. Buser and P. Sarnak proved the following inequalities for the closed orientable surfaces Σs of genus s: there exists a constant C > 0 independent of s such that

[formula]

In dimension 4, M. Katz [\cite=Ka] proved a similar inequality for the conformal 2-systole of blow-ups of the complex projective plane [formula]: there exists a constant C > 0 independent of n such that

[formula]

In his proof, M. Katz used a conjecture on the period map of 4-manifolds X with b+2 = 1. The period map is defined as the map taking a Riemannian metric g to the point in the projectivization of the positive cone in [formula] given by the g-selfdual direction (see Section [\ref=def]). The conjecture, which is still open, claims that this map is surjective. However, an inspection of the proof of M. Katz shows that this surjectivity conjecture in full strength is not needed and that in fact his theorem holds in much greater generality.

In Section [\ref=proofs], we first remark that the following proposition holds as a consequence of recent work of D. T. Gay and R. Kirby [\cite=GK].

The period map for all closed 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1 has dense image.

Using the argument of M. Katz, this implies the following theorem.

There exists a universal constant C independent of X and n = b2(X) such that

[formula]

for all closed 4-manifolds X with b+2 = 1 which have odd intersection form.

Another consequence of Proposition [\ref=dense] is the following theorem.

Let X,X' be closed 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1 which have isomorphic intersection forms. Then CS(X) = CS(X').

This shows that in dimension 4 the invariant CS is much coarser than a diffeomorphism invariant. Theorem [\ref=coarse] can be compared to a result of I. K. Babenko ([\cite=Ba], Theorem 8.1.), who showed that a certain 1-dimensional systolic invariant for manifolds of arbitrary dimension is a homotopy-invariant.

Theorem [\ref=coarse] enables us to deal with even intersection forms. Suppose X is a closed 4-manifold with b+2 = 1 and even intersection form. By the classification of indefinite even quadratic forms, the intersection form of X is isomorphic to [formula] for some k  ≥  0. In particular, for each [formula] there are only finitely many possible even intersection forms of rank less or equal than r. Hence by Theorem [\ref=coarse], the invariant CS takes only finitely many values on all 4-manifolds with even intersection form, b+2 = 1 and b2  ≤  r. We will show that symplectic 4-manifolds X with b+2(X) = 1 and even intersection form necessarily have b2(X)  ≤  10 (see Section [\ref=symplectic]). The same bound holds if X satisfies the so-called [formula]-conjecture (see Section [\ref=5/4]). Hence together with Theorem [\ref=katz], we get the following corollary, which possibly covers all 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1.

There exists a universal constant C independent of X and n = b2(X) such that

[formula]

for all closed 4-manifolds X with b+2 = 1 which are symplectic or have odd intersection form Q or satisfy the [formula]-conjecture if Q is even.

Definitions

Let (X2n,g) be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold. We denote the space of g-harmonic n-forms on X by Hn(X). The Riemannian metric defines an L2-norm on Hn(X) by

[formula]

where *   is the Hodge operator.

Given the unique representation of cohomology classes by harmonic forms, we obtain an induced norm |  ·  |g, which we call the g-norm, on the middle-dimensional cohomology [formula]. The conformal n-systole is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the integer lattice in [formula]. More generally, if L is any lattice with a norm |  ·  |, we define

[formula]

hence [formula]. The conformal systole depends only on the conformal class of g since the Hodge star operator in the middle dimension is invariant under conformal changes of the metric.

The conformal systoles satisfy the following universal bound (see [\cite=Ka] equation (4.3)):

[formula]

Clearly, there is also a bound for bn(X) = 1, since the Hodge operator on harmonic forms is up to a sign the identity in this case, hence n(X,g) = 1. Therefore, the supremum

[formula]

is well-defined for all closed orientable manifolds X2n.

We now consider the case of 4-manifolds, n = 2. In this case the g-norm on [formula] is related to the intersection form Q by the following formula:

[formula]

where α  =  α+  +  α- is the decomposition given by the splitting [formula] into the subspaces represented by g-selfdual and anti-selfdual harmonic forms. We abbreviate this formula to

[formula]

where SR denotes sign-reversal. Since H+ is the Q-orthogonal complement of H-, we conclude that the norm |  ·  |g is completely determined by the intersection form and the g-anti-selfdual subspace H-.

In particular, let X be a closed oriented 4-manifold with b+2  =   dim H+ = 1. The map which takes a Riemannian metric to the selfdual line H+ in the cone P of elements of positive square in [formula] (or to the point in the projectivization [formula] of this cone) is called the period map. In the proof of his theorem, M. Katz used the following conjecture, which is still open, in the case of blow-ups of [formula].

The period map is surjective for all closed oriented 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1.

If X is a 4-manifold with b+2 = 1, we switch the orientation (this does not change the g-norm on [formula]) to obtain b-2 = 1. Then the g-norm is completely determined by the intersection form and the selfdual line, which in the new orientation is H-.

Let X̄ be a 4-manifold with b-2 = 1 and intersection form [formula] and let L be the integer lattice in [formula]. Then λ1(L,SR(,V)1 / 2) depends continuously on the anti-selfdual line V.

This follows because the vector space norm SR(,V)1 / 2 depends continuously on V and the minimum in λ1 cannot jump (cf. Remark 9.1. in [\cite=Ka]).

Proof of Proposition [\ref=dense], Theorem [\ref=katz] and Theorem [\ref=coarse]

The following theorem can be deduced from recent work of D. T. Gay and R. Kirby [\cite=GK] (compare also [\cite=ADK]).

If X is a closed oriented 4-manifold and [formula] a class of positive square, then there exists a Riemannian metric on X such that the harmonic representative of α is selfdual.

This implies Proposition [\ref=dense], because the set of points given by the lines through integral classes in [formula] form a dense subset of [formula]. We can now prove Theorem [\ref=coarse].

Let X̄ be X with the opposite orientation, L be the integer lattice in [formula] and  =  - Q. We have

[formula]

where the supremum extends over all negative definite lines V in [formula]. This inequality is an equality because the image of the period map is dense and because of Lemma [\ref=cont]. The right-hand side depends only on the intersection form.

We now prove Theorem [\ref=katz].

Let X be a closed 4-manifold with intersection form [formula] for some n > 0. It is enough to prove inequalities of the form [formula] for some constants A,B > 0, since we can then take C =  max {A- 1,B}. The inequality on the right-hand side follows from equation ([\ref=bound]). We are going to prove the inequality on the left, following the proof of M. Katz.

There exists a constant k(n) > 0 (which depends only on n and is asymptotic to n / 2πe for large n) such that

[formula]

It is more convenient to work with X̄, which is X with the opposite orientation. We identify [formula] with quadratic form qn,1 given by qn,1(x) = x21 + ... + x2n - x2n + 1. If g is a metric on X̄ then the g-norm is given by |  ·  |2g = SR(qn,1,v) where * v =  - v and SR means sign reversal in the direction of v.

Let [formula] be the integer lattice. According to Conway-Thompson (see [\cite=MH], Ch. II, Theorem 9.5), there exists a positive definite odd integer lattice CTn of rank n with

[formula]

where k(n) is asymptotic to n / 2πe for n  →    ∞  . By the classification of odd indefinite unimodular forms, [formula], hence there exists a vector [formula] with qn,1(v) =  - 1 such that [formula].

According to M. Katz, there exists an isometry A of [formula] such that

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=dense], there exists a sequence of Riemannian metrics gi on X whose selfdual lines converge to the line through Av. Lemma [\ref=cont] implies

[formula]

Hence CS(X)  ≥  k(n)1 / 4.

Lemma [\ref=conway] finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=katz].

Symplectic manifolds

We now show that symplectic 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1 necessarily have b2  ≤  10, as stated in the introduction (note that we always assume symplectic forms to be compatible with the orientation, i.e. of positive square).

Let X be a closed symplectic 4-manifold with b+2 = 1 and even intersection form Q. Then [formula] or [formula].

Here H denotes the bilinear form given by [formula] and E8 is a positive-definite, even form of rank 8 associated to the Dynkin diagram of the Lie group E8 (see [\cite=GS]).

If b-2 = 0 then Q = (1). If b-2 > 0 then Q is indefinite and hence of the form [formula], since Q is even. It follows that X is minimal because the intersection form does not split off a ( - 1). If K2 < 0 then according to a theorem of A.-K. Liu [\cite=Liu], X is an irrational ruled surface and hence has intersection form Q = H (or [formula], which is odd). If K2 = 2χ + 3σ  ≥  0 then 4b1 + b-2  ≤  9 and b1 = 0 or b1 = 2, because 1 - b1(X) + b+2(X) is an even number for every almost complex 4-manifold X. If b1 = 0 then b-2  ≤  9, hence Q = H or [formula]. If b1 = 2 then b-2  ≤  1, hence Q = H.

It is possible to give a different proof of Proposition [\ref=dense] for symplectic manifolds, which relies on a theorem of T.-J. Li and A.-K. Liu ([\cite=LL3], Theorem 4). This theorem implies that on a closed 4-manifold X with b+2 = 1 which admits a symplectic structure, the set of classes in [formula] represented by symplectic forms is dense in the positive cone, because it is the complement of at most countably many hyperplanes. If a closed symplectic 4-manifold with b+2 = 1 is minimal (i.e. there are no symplectic ( - 1)-spheres), then the period map is in fact surjective.

The [formula]-conjecture and some examples

The [formula]-conjecture is a weak analogue of the [formula]-conjecture which relates the signature and second Betti number of spin 4-manifolds. The main result in this direction is a theorem of M. Furuta [\cite=F], generalizing work of S. K. Donaldson [\cite=D1] [\cite=D2], that all closed oriented spin 4-manifolds X with b2(X) > 0 satisfy the inequality

[formula]

where σ(X) denotes the signature. C. Bohr [\cite=Bo] then proved a slightly weaker inequality [formula] for all 4-manifolds with even intersection form and certain fundamental groups, including all finite and all abelian groups. These are special instances of the following general [formula]-conjecture.

If X is a closed oriented even 4-manifold, then

[formula]

where σ(X) denotes the signature.

Here we call a 4-manifold even, if it has even intersection form.

J.-H. Kim [\cite=Ki] has proposed a proof of the [formula]-conjecture. However, some doubts have been raised about the validity of the proof. Therefore, we have chosen to state the result still as a conjecture.

If X is an even 4-manifold with b+2 = 1, then the [formula]-conjecture holds for X if and only if [formula] or [formula].

If X is an even 4-manifold with b+2 = 1, then [formula] for some k  ≥  0. The [formula]-conjecture is equivalent to k  ≤  1.

In particular, by Lemma [\ref=symp], the [formula]-conjecture holds for all even symplectic 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1.

There are many examples of 4-manifolds with b+2 = 1 where Theorem [\ref=coarse] applies, e.g. the infinite family of simply-connected pairwise non-diffeomorphic Dolgachev surfaces which are all homeomorphic to [formula] (see [\cite=GS]). These 4-manifolds are Kähler, hence symplectic. There are also recent constructions of infinite families of non-symplectic and pairwise non-diffeomorphic 4-manifolds homeomorphic to [formula] for n  ≥  5 (see [\cite=FS2] [\cite=PSS]). If we take multiple blow-ups of these manifolds, the blow-up formula for the Seiberg-Witten invariants [\cite=FS1] shows that the resulting manifolds stay pairwise non-diffeomorphic. Hence we obtain infinite families of symplectic and non-symplectic 4-manifolds X with n = b2(X)  →    ∞  , where Theorem [\ref=katz] applies.
