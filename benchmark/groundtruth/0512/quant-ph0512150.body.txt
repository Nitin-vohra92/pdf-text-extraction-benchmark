STATISTICAL SEPARABILITY AND THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN QUANTUM THEORY, RELATIVITY AND THE CAUSALITY

In 1935, Einstein et al[\cite=e] assumed that the world is separable to prove the incompleteness of quantum theory. The separability here means one can always separate two systems by a space, so that a disturbance act on one of them cannot influence another system immediately. This separability seemed to be self-evident, since otherwise the prompt signal transmission would be possible. About thirty years later, Bell[\cite=b] changed the thought experiment used in [\cite=e] to be a kind of experiment which can be really done. After that, many experimental results on the problem of separability have been reported. They show that Einstein's assumption of separability is false. One may see this conclusion in examples [\cite=l] [\cite=t]. The world is proven to be non-separable in Einstein's sense. This result raises the question on the consistency between the quantum theory, relativity, and the causality, and on the possibility of the super-luminal transmission of signals.

The quantum state of a system is usually defined at a given time but in the whole space, therefore is non-local and non-separable, in contrast to the classical state. Two parts of a system even-though separated by empty space may be correlated. Their states may be entangled if they had contacted and therefore interacted each other previously. People tried to use this entanglement for signal transmission, and have got experimental success[\cite=bo]. It is called quantum communication. However the super-luminal signal transmission is still not realized, and it has been proven to be impossible[\cite=g]. It makes people feel that the quantum theory may be consistent with relativity and causality. In the following we show that this feeling is reliable.

To make the theory be Lorentz invariant, the quantum state is defined on a space-like super-surface of space-time in general. It is non-local. However, the dynamics of the state evolution along a time-like direction is governed by differential equation. It is therefore local. According to the multi-time formulation[\cite=d]-[\cite=j] of the quantum field theory, the state |σ〉 on a space-like super-surface σ and the state [formula] on a nearby space-like super-surface [formula] are related by the Schrödinger equation
