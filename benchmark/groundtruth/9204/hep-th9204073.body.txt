ABSTRACT

We study the topological nature of both isotropic and anisotropic SU(N) Thirring model. It is shown that in the isotropic model there exists the special point where the system lives in the topological phase and that in the anisotropic one which is obtained by introducing two coupling constants and has U(1) symmetry, we present a simple mechanism of the dynamical topological phase transition which takes place at the infinite energy scale.

The chiral massless Thirring model is one of the simple models which realize the non -perturbative effect of the fundamental interaction. In [\cite=Gross] , it is shown that the famous 1/N expansion analysis enables us to see the non-perturbative effect of the four-fermions coupling, that is, the dynamical mass generation. But, this is not a whole story. This type of analysis is valid still in the small coupling region while in the strong one it may not be applicable and we have to take into account a new non-perturbative effect in the theory. For example, in the strong coupling region, it may happen that the higher order correction causes the symmetry breaking or a drastic change of the phase structure of the system.

In this paper, we make a primitive observation on the topological aspect of the chiral SU(N) Thirring model. As we will see, there exists the special point where the local internal symmetry is generated, the dynamically generated mass becomes infinite and the model possesses the topological nature. As a by-product, we present a simple scenario in which the dynamical phase transition happens at the high energy limit and the system moves to the region of the topological phase. This type of the phase transition is different from the K-T type and gives us a new mechanism for the one generated by a pure dynamical process.

We first consider the SU(N) Thirring model given by the following Lagrangian

[formula]

where [formula] are Dirac fermions and Ta are the generators of U(N). For small value of g <  < 1, the classical continuous U(N) chiral symmetry

[formula]

is broken by the non-perturbative quantum effect of four fermions interactions and the dynamical mass is generated as discussed in [\cite=Gross].

Instead of this fact, let us try to find certain value of g for which the theory has some type of the continuous internal symmetry in the Lagrangian through the perturbative approach.

We assume the following continuous non-chiral U(N) transformation which the classical theory does not share,

[formula]

Taking it into account that the each term in Lagrangian is regularized by point-splitting procedure

[formula]

the fermion currents are transformed into

[formula]

Substituting these equations into the Lagrangian, we see that by setting g = 1, the Lagrangian is invariant up to the polynomials of G(G- 1) and its derivatives which does not change the dynamics at all.

In this way, we define the massless Thirring model with the local internal symmetry, that is, the gauge symmetry at the special value of the coupling constant at the lowest order. For the time being, we assume without any reason that this symmetry is not broken by the higher order correction. To see the feature of this model let us consider for example, the correlation function of the fermion currents jaL,R,

[formula]

This is diverge because of the local symmetry and the correlation length is infinite. From this fact we expect that the phase transition takes place and the system lives in the ordered phase here.

Let us consider the U(1) Thirring model for illustration. This model is massless for any value of g in the quantum level and by using the bosonization formula, the Lagrangian can be rewritten as

[formula]

At g = 1, the Lagrangian is zero and the correlation function of currents 〈∂L,Rφ(z)∂L,Rφ〉 becomes diverge. It is instructive to mention the 1 dimensional quantum spin chain in this case. The U(1) Thirring model is obtained by performing the continuum limit of the spin 1/2 spin chain whose Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where n is the index of site on the 1 dimensional chain and the Sin are spin operator in spin 1/2 representation of SU(2) on site n. [\cite=Aff] At the interval  - 1 < q < 1, the system is critical and at the point q = 1 which corresponds to g = 1, the state is in the ferroelectric-ordered phase and completely frozen. Indeed the correlation function 〈Sz(x)Sz(y)〉 goes to infinity as q approaches unity. It should be remarked that the system () at q = 1 can not be described as the limit g  →  1 in ([\ref=Boson]) since the form of the dispersion relation in the ferroelectric phase is not relativistic one.

The problem is how to define the SU(N) Thirring model at g = 1. We choose to construct the relativistic theory way and to this end formulate the system by introducing external gauge fields AaL,R and rewrite the Lagrangian as

[formula]

This theory is the two dimensional QCD in the strong coupling limit and there are no kinetic terms of the gauge fields. It is first discussed in Polyakov's lecture [\cite=Pol] and he showed that if the gauge group is U(N) the total current anomaly is canceled out and the central charge is equal to zero. In fact, if we do not fix the gauge, the constraint in ([\ref=2QCD]) for the total current reads

[formula]

This equation indicates the analogy between the operators jaL,R and - eAaL,R for example, in the transformation property by G. Indeed we have already seen this property in ([\ref=gaugetrans]) and consider this equation to be valid as the operator equation. Since the central charge is zero we conclude that the massless Thirring model can be defined to be a relativistic topological theory at g = 1 by adopting the formulation based on the Lagrangian ([\ref=2QCD]). It happens that the fermion current is transmuted into the gauge current and eats up its own dynamical degree of freedom by tuning the coupling constant. Recently some detail analysis on this model is given by using the BRST formalism in [\cite=Komata]. According to [\cite=Komata], we can consider the theory to be massless and define the energy momentum tensor which is BRST exact. Besides the system has the N=2 super conformal symmetry by twisting it. As a relevant topic, the U(1) gauge-Higgs model in two dimension is studied by using the same method in [\cite=Ichinose].

To justify the above discussion completely we compare our results with the exact solution obtained through the Bethe-Ansatz approach [\cite=Andrei]. The exact solution of the SU(N)(N≥  2) Thirring model was given by Andrei and Lowenstein from the modified Bethe Ansatz approach used in the case of the famous Kondo model which describes the dynamics of conduction electrons and impurities. Let us consider the n particle state and assume that the size of the system is l. The cut-off Λ of momentum is given by n / l and the continuum limit is obtained by taking the limit Λ  →    ∞  . It can be shown easily that the Hamiltonian which governs the wave function in the coordinate space is essentially equivalent to the one for n particles with the interaction of the delta function type [\cite=Andrei],

[formula]

where c is the effective coupling constant which depends on g as c(g)  ~  g / (1 - g2). Since the coupling constant is diverge at g = 1, the state can be shown to be frozen in a following way. Let us consider the path integral

[formula]

and at g = 1, only the solution of the equation of motion contributes to Z and is trivial since in L / c(g) the kinetic terms becomes zero.

We mention briefly the renormalization flow. The special point we have discussed is unstable. Indeed, in the region 0 < g < 1, the renormalized coupling constant decreases (g  →  0) as discussed in [\cite=Gross] and in g > 1, it increases (g  →    ∞  ). In the former region, the dynamical mass is generated and in the limit g = 1 is diverge as ~  Λ. In the latter one the theory is non-unitary since the coefficient of the kinetic term of U(1) bosonic field [formula] is negative.

So far we analyzed the ordinary SU(N) Thirring model and showed that some special feature is realized at the point which is located on the boundary of the unitary region. From this fact, it is tempting to treat the anisotropic Thirring model which is obtained by introducing distinct coupling constants and see the topological feature since the non-unitary region would appear in a more non-trivial way and there would be a special line instead of the point. We will see a simple mechanism for the dynamical topological phase transition on the line.

To construct the model, we introduce two coupling constants gh,gv and define the Lagrangian as

[formula]

where δ0 and δ± denote the Cartan subalgebra of U(N) and non-Cartan one respectively.

The special line we will discuss from now on is the one defined by gh = 1 on which there is the local U(1) symmetry [formula] in the system. To see this, note that the interaction part of the abelian currents can be rewritten as

[formula]

and is that of the N-copies of the U(1) Thirring model. We remark that at the points (gh,gv)=(1,1) (1,0), the system is topological.

Let us set gv very small and assume that the perturbative analysis is sufficient to study a qualitative feature of the model. By bosonizing the fermion fields ψi, we see that only the interaction terms between non-abelian currents remain

[formula]

where Λ is the ultra violet cut-off and μ is the scale parameter. The renormalized coupling constant grv vanishes as ~  1 / Λ2 and the system goes to the stable point (gh,gv) = (1,0) where the system is topological as we explained before. The absence of the kinetic term implies that there is no scattering process and the S matrix is unity. It should be noted that the theory is not topological in the sense that we have the parameter Λ and the renormalization flow of gv.

In the case of SU(2), the exact solution was derived through the Bethe-Ansatz technique in [\cite=Truong] [\cite=Duty]. In the diagram of the renormalization flow, the line is denoted by A and called the Luther-Emery line.(See Fig. 1) It can be shown that the theory is massless and free on this line for 0 < gv < 1 at the ultra violet limit Λ  →    ∞   and hence the above discussion is still correct in the strong coupling region. For other case, although the exact solution is not constructed explicitly yet and we can not justify the argument in the case of the strong coupling, we believe that there exists an line on which the system behaves in a similar way.

Thus we present the simple scenario for the asymptotic topological theory on the Luther-Emery line while the theory is asymptotic free on the other line 0 < gh = gv < 1. On this line the system has the local U(1) internal symmetry and at the end point, becomes the sum of the decoupled U(1) Thirring models each of which lives in the topological phase.

The lesson we learned in both isotropic and anisotropic Thirring model is that on the renormalization flow, the local internal symmetry is preserved and if the symmetry is enhanced enough to carry away the dynamical degree of freedom at the fixed point, the theory is topological. For example, in the case of the isotropic O(N)(N>  2) Thirring model, we have the same story at certain value of coupling constant, but in the anisotropic case, can not realize the dynamical phase transition in a similar way since the U(1) current can not exist.

In previous argument we assumed that the number of fermion is finite (N  <    ∞  ). Now we mention the case of the infinite number of fermions and consider the SU(∞  ) Thirring model. From the exact solution it is easily seen that the dynamical mass is infinite for any value of g and only the U(1) bosonic field exists. As before at g = 1 system has the local U(∞  ) symmetry the generators of which constitute the k=1, U(∞  ) algebra. By rescaling fermion fields as

[formula]

they can be formally considered to live in the three dimensional space ([formula]). When we have no dynamics in any direction at all it is permitted to call the system the three dimensional topological theory.

Finally we make brief comments. It is not yet clear why the topological aspect appears at the special points. The basic observation is that the higher order correction which is not observed in the 1/N expansion analysis contribute somehow and the system has the local internal symmetry there. It may be necessary to consider this symmetry from a different point of view. We also hope that the mechanism of the dynamical topological phase transition may give us a key to build more interesting models such as realize a general covariant version.
