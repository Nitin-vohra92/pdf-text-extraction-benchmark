ROSAT and BeppoSAX evidence of soft X-ray excess emission in the Shapley supercluster: A3571, A3558, A3560 and A3562

Introduction

Clusters of galaxies are strong emitters of soft X-rays, often in excess of the contribution from the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM; Lieu at al. 1196a; Lieu et al. 1996b; Mittaz, Lieu and Lockman 1998; Lieu, Bonamente and Mittaz 1999; Bonamente, Lieu and Mittaz 2001). The PSPC detector onboard ROSAT is well suited for the observation of diffuse sources in the 1/4 keV band: along with a large effective area (of about 200 cm2 at 0.28 keV), the large field-of-view of 1 degree radius allowed the contemporaneous acquisition of source signals (usually near boresight) and local background (at large detector radii) with equal exposures. The Low-Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS) aboard BeppoSAX also has appreciable effective areas (of ~  10 cm2 at 0.28 keV) and can be used for similar investigations.

Soft X-ray fluxes are significantly absorbed by intervening Galactic material (mainly HI and HeI) along the line of sight. At the Galactic NH values of the Shapley supercluster (~  4 - 4.5  ×  1020 cm- 2), 0.2 keV photons encounter a total optical depth of ~  4, which accordingly reduces their flux by about 98 %. The HeI absorption cross-section was recently revised (Yan et al. 1998 and references therein), leading to a reinstatement of the original absorption code of Morrison and McCammon (1983) as the most reliable. This code is therefore employed in the present work. The crucial task, however, is to measure NH with a spatial resolution ≤   the cluster size. For details on how this was fulfilled, see section 2. In this paper we present results on a sample of nearby clusters (A3571, A3558, A3560 and A3562, at redshift z~   0.04-0.05) in the Shapley concentration. The analysis of four PSPC observations revealed statistically significant 1/4 keV band (~   0.2-0.4 keV) excess emission for all of the clusters, although the intrinsic low surface brightness of A3560 and A3562 implied a limited S/N. Data from two pointed SAX/LECS observations were available for two of the four clusters (A3571 and A3562); clear evidence of soft excess emission is present in the A3571 data, while results for A3562 were marginal, due to the faintness of the cluster. Thus the soft excess syndrome may be common to a large fraction of clusters, as suggested also by our earlier analyses of a nearby sample of clusters with EUVE, contrary to the findings of Bowyer et al. (1999,2001) which claim no general importance of the effect (see also Lieu et al. 1999 and Bonamente, Lieu and Mittaz 2001 for reinforcement of the original conclusions through confirmatory re-observations conducted in such modes as to address all the objections of our critics.). This paper presents the data analysis method and results for the current sample, with emphasis on the PSPC analysis; future works will be devoted to larger scale surveys, with both PSPC and LECS instruments, in order to assess the cosmological impact of the phenomenon.

Infrared, 21-cm and X-ray observations of A3571, A3558, A3562 and A3560

The Shapley Supercluster is a large region of galaxy overdensity around α = 13h25m, δ =  - 30o and redshift ~   0.045 (Shapley 1930; Ettori, Fabian and White 1997 and references therein) comprising more than 20 galaxy clusters. We focused our attention on four Supercluster members: A3571 and A3558 are rich and hot clusters (Markevitch et al. 1998; Markevitch and Vikhlinin 1997), A3560 (Ebeling et al. 1996) and A3562 (White 2000; see also Ettori et al. 2000) are within ~   2 degrees from the former and show lower X-ray luminosity (Fig. 1). All clusters were targets of pointed PSPC observations (archival identification code RP800287 for A3571, exp. time 5 ks; RP800076 for A3558, 28 ks; RP800381 for A3560, 5 ks; RP800237 for A3562, 18 ks), and two of them of pointed SAX LECS/MECS observation (observation number 60843002 for A3571, 29 ks of LECS exposure, and 60638001 for A3562, 19 ks) .

Dedicated narrow-beam 21-cm observations of galaxy clusters are available from the NRAO 100-meter GBT telescope with a resolution of 10 arcmin (Murphy, Sembach and Lockman 2001; see Table 1). In addition we also consulted the Dickey and Lockman (1990) survey data at lower resolution and IRAS 100 μm maps with ~   3 arcmin resolution (Wheelock et al. 1994). In particular, the IRAS data has a two-fold relevance to soft X-ray studies: on one hand the positive NH-IR correlation allows the use of 100 μm maps as tracer of the total column density of Galactic material (Boulanger and Perault 1988); on the other hand, the NH-soft X-ray background (SXB) anticorrelation (Snowden et al. 1998) requires precise knowledge of the HI column density at the position where the local background was determined. In the case of PSPC this is typically a few ×   10 arcmin away from the cluster center.

PSPC analysis

The analysis of PSPC data was performed following the prescriptions of Snowden et al. (1994); in particular, detector gain corrections were applied using the dedicated FTOOL PCPICOR, and detector vignetting was accounted for in the background subtraction procedure. The spectral analysis involved only PI channels 20-201 (~   0.2-2.0 keV by photon energy), in order to avoid any calibration uncertainties of the lower energy 1-19 PI channels. Following the nomenclature reported in Snowden et al. (1994), PI channels 20-41 will be referred to as the R2 band (also 1/4 keV or C band), and channels 42-69 as R34 band.

First, we compared the IR emission of the cluster regions with the emission in the corresponding background regions (Fig. 1); deviations were always within at most 10 %, and this implies that the SXB of the background regions is indeed relevant to the cluster regions without further scaling (see Snowden et al. 1998). Secondly, a comparison of the IR emission between the cluster regions covered by the GBT beam (~   10 arcmin angular diameter) and the outer cluster regions showed that the NH is smoothly distributed on the cluster's scale. In accordance to the NH-IR correlation (with a scaling factor of about 1.2 ×  1020 cm- 2 (MJy sr- 1)- 1; Boulanger and Perault 1988) the 100 μm maps implied only marginal adjustments from the central NH measurements; as a consequence, we decided to apply Galactic column densities as in Table 1 for all subsequent analyses.

The limited passband of the PSPC instrument can only be used to measure approximate values of the cluster hot gas temperatures. Thus we modelled the A3571 and A3558 spectra for annular regions with the best-fit temperatures of ASCA (Markevitch et al. 1998; Markevitch and Vikhlinin 1997; in agreement with SAX/MECS results for A3571, see Nevalainen et al. 2001), with the exception of the central regions where temperature gradients are too steep for the point spread function (PSF) of ASCA: here T was fitted to the data. Temperatures of A3560 and A3562 were determined by spectral fits to the PSPC data, and results agreed with previously published measurements (White 2000 and Ebeling et al. 1996). We modelled the entire PSPC X-ray spectrum (0.2-2.0 keV) with a one-temperature photoabsorbed thin-plasma emission code (WABS and MEKAL codes in XSPEC).

Background spectra for subtraction purposes were extracted from same pointed observation as the cluster's, and from annular regions immediately outside the detected cluster emission (see Fig. 1); statistical errors in the background were properly propagated. This provides a spatially and temporally contiguous (or in situ) background. Best parameter values for the hot gas are shown in Table 1. As the χ2 values indicate, some of the fits are poor, due to the excess emission above the 1-T model at low energies. In more detail, we compared the best-fit model with the measured emission in the R2 and R34 bands (Fig. 2 and 3). The 1/4 keV band results show consistently positive residuals for all of the 4 clusters; the R34 band bears, on the other hand, evidence of depleted fluxes in some regions. For A3571 and A3558, there is evidence of an increasing relative importance of the excess component with cluster radius, an effect already found in EUVE data of other galaxy clusters (Virgo, A1795 and A2199; see, e.g., Bonamente, Lieu and Mittaz 2001 and Lieu, Bonamente and Mittaz 1999).

SAX LECS analysis

The SAX mission lends an additional view of the phenomenon, with an instrument, LECS, that employs different and complementary characteristics. With a field of view of radius ~  16 arcmin, local background can be obtained only for compact clusters (such as A3562); a long-term campaign of accumulation of high Galactic latitude 'blank' fields, however, enables one to establish a template detector background applicable to clusters which fill the entire FOV (such as A3571; see Parmar et al. 1999). The energy dependent Point Spread Function (PSF) of the LECS instruments complicates the analysis of extended objects such as clusters of galaxies, as its 90% encircled energy radius increases from 6 to 9 between 8 keV and 0.2 keV. In this work, we accounted for the PSF by generating appropriate instrument response files to be used when fitting the accumulated spectra. For the response generation we used the ray-tracing code LEMAT (Lammers 1997), taking into account the extraction region size and source position on the detector, mirror vignetting and obscuration by the detector support structure (strongback).

Modeling of the low-energy emission from A3571 was performed through a joint fit of MECS/LECS spectra to a photoabsorbed MEKAL code (as for PSPC), which returned the best-fit parameters of the hot ICM consistent with those of Table 2 (see Nevalainen et al. 2001 for the details on the LECS/MECS analysis of this data set): excess emission in the 0.15-0.3 keV region is again detected with high statistical significance (Fig. 4). The faint emission from the A3562 cluster was likewise assessed by modelling LECS spectra with the customary photoabsorbed MEKAL code, where the hot ICM parameters were fixed at the values of Table 2; results are marginalized by the lower S/N (see Fig. 4). It is worthwhile to point out that the in situ background, available for this cluster from an outer annulus where the source emission ceased, is fully consistent with the template 'blank' field background. This is a crucial test which verifies the reliability of the latter for those cases where the size of the cluster renders the former unavailable.

Interpretation of R2 and R34 band fluxes

The results shown in Fig. 2 (and Fig. 4) indicate that the 1-T model employed to describe the ICM falls short of the detected soft emission, revealing the soft excess emission. The data quality for A3571 and A3558 warrants the employment of a more complex model to try to interpret the detected spectral features.

The A3558 soft excess is virtually unaccompanied by a R34 trough, and therefore a second optically-thin plasma component at lower temperature can model the excess. We shall present the 3-6 and 6-9 arcmin annuli as representative regions, just outside the central cooling flow, and where signals are of sufficient statistical quality to apply detailed modelling, see Table 2. We likewise tested the possiblity of the excess originating as an inverse Compton (IC) effect, with the result that the data equally well accomodates the non-thermal interpretation (see Table 2 for details). We also calculated the energetic requirements of the additional model, with the results that the luminosity of either thermal/non thermal component accounts for only a fraction of the hot ICM luminosity in the 0.1-0.4 keV band.

Moving to A3571, we again describe a representative region, the 4-8 arcmin annulus. Here the ~  3σ R2 band excess pairs with a depleted emission in the neighboring R34 band (Fig. 2 and 3.), i.e. the employement of a second thin plasma model at lower T brings only a modest improvement to the fit. We know, however, that warm photoionized gas (T ~  106 K) may present substantial opacity to soft X-ray photons (e.g., Krolik and Kallman 1984), and the thin-plasma approximation may not necessarily apply. A phenomenological way of parametrizing such behaviour is the addition of a second thin-plasma model modified by an absorption edge, which in fact proves a successful fit to the data (see best-fit parameters in Table 2). Other regions of Table 2 show a qualitatively similar behavior, see Fig. 2 and 3; statistical quality of the data does not however warrant a more detailed modelling for them.

We also entertained the notion of a soft X-ray excess as peculiar variations of the Galactic NH (Arabadjis and Bregman 1999), by applying the same 1-T thermal models above leaving the NH to be fitted by the data. The A3571 and A3558 PSPC spectra would in such case require a Galactic column density at odds with the measured values, and some 1/4 keV band excess would nonetheless remain unexplained (see Table 1 and Fig. 5).

Discussion and conclusions

The analysis we present in this paper shows that, at soft X-ray energies, PSPC spectra of the clusters in our sample (A3571, A2558, A3560 and A3562) are not well described by a simple one-temperature thin plasma model. Similar conclusions hold for the LECS data of A3571 and A3562. The case of A3558, the cluster with the higest S/N data of the sample, indicates that the soft excess can be interpretated as having a thermal origin (from a second phase of the ICM at lower temperature) as well as the non-thermal. Earlier EUVE observations led to the discovery of soft excess emission for the brightest clusters with low Galactic HI columns (such as Coma and Virgo, see references in section 1), but they lack the necessary sensitivity to enable a reliable assesment of fainter sources, such as those reported in this work. The PSPC and LECS data presented here show that, given a sufficient sensitivity, low energy spectra of galaxy clusters consistently show excess emission above the hot ICM contribution, in sharp contrast with the conclusions of Bowyer et al. (2001). Settlement of the issue regarding the origin of the emission has to await forthcoming observations by detectors of higher resolution.

Large solid circles represent the approximate cluster positions, the two small circles between A3562 and A3558 are the groups of galaxies SC1329 and A1327 (respectively from left to right; see Ettori et al. 1997 for more detailed maps). Each dotted annulus (or sector thereof) represents the approximate region from which the background for the corresponding cluster was extracted; care was taken in avoiding regions occupied by SC1329 and SC1327 and obvious point sources.

Figure 2: Radial distribution (in arcmin, x-axis) of the fractional R2 band excess, η, of the four clusters, defined as η  =  (p2 - q2) / q2, where p2 is observed R2 band flux and q2 the expected R2 band flux from the hot ICM. Negative values of ζ indicate that detected emission is below the expected value.

Figure 3: As in Figure 2, except now for the fractional R34 band excess ζ  =  (p34 - q34) / q34 where p34 is observed R34 band flux and q34 is expected R34 band flux from hot ICM.

Figure 4: Radial distribution of the SAX/LECS fractional excess in the 0.15-0.3 keV band for A3571 and A3562, plotted in the same manner as Figure 2.

Figure 5: As in Figure 2, except here the expected ICM fluxes are derived by fitting NH. Soft excess fluxes in some regions of A3571 remain nonetheless unexplained. In order to eliminate such excesses, we estimate that a NH of 4.05 ±  0.150.2  ×  1020 (4-8 arcmin region) and 3 ±  0.50.4  ×  1020 (12-16 arcmin region) would be required, significantly lower than the measured values (see Table 1).
