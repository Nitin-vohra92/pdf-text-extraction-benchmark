Comment on "Experimental Separation of Geometric and Dynamical Phases Using Neutron Interferometry"

------------ submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett. MS version of 17 Oct 1997; Note and references added on 24 Feb 2001.

In ref. [\cite=wagh], Wagh et.al. report a neutron interferometer measurement of (a) a linearly increasing geometric phase shift as a function of physical rotation δβ between two dual spin flippers in the range [formula] and [formula] and (b) a π-phase shift resulting from reversal of current in the two coils of the flipper. While (b) is an interesting observation, we point out that extrapolation of the linear phase measured in (a) to larger values of δβ and plotting the results of the two experiments, which are in different parameter spaces, on the same curve is unjustified, both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, the straight line in figure 2 of ref.[\cite=wagh] ignores the factor cos(δβ / 2) in the precession angle of the flipper, which is intrinsic to the experiment and important for large δβ. This accounted for, the expected phase shift for large δβ is neither linear nor purely geometric. It has a dynamical term. Experimentally, a continuously measured phase shift is defined in its absolute value and not just modulo 2π. We show that the equivalence of π-rotation of the flipper and current reversal is only modulo 2π.

Consider a version of the Wagh et. al. experiment in which the currents in the two coils of one of the flippers, producing magnetic fields B1y and B2y in the y-direction are varied independently while those in the other flipper remain constant and the phase difference between the two beams is monitored at small intervals in the parameter space spanned by B1y and B2y, measured in units of the precession angle in degrees. As long as the fringe contrast, determined by the magnitude of the scalar product c of the spin states of the two interfering beams is greater than zero, the phase difference, defined by the phase of c (Pancharatnam criterion [\cite=panch]), is measurable as shift of the fringe maxima. The points in the B1y, B2y plane where the two interfering spin states become orthogonal, form a lattice of phase singularities of strength +1 and -1. This happens when the dual flipper produces precession equal to zero or 2nπ; n being any integer. For example, the point (0,0) has a -1 singularity and the point q(180,180), where [formula], has a +1 singularity. Field reversal corresponds to passage from the point I, i.e. q( - 180,180) to F, i.e. q(180, - 180), along some path in the parameter space.

Figure 1 shows the computed phase evolution along three such paths IAF (solid line), IBF (dotted line) and ICF (dashed line), where A, B, C are the points q(179,179), q(181,181) and q(1,1) respectively and IA, AF, IB, BC, IC and CF are straight lines, each divided into 100 equal steps for computation. One sees that the phase change for field reversal can be +  π or -  π depending upon the location of the path with respect to the singularities and can be highly nonlinear near a singularity. For closed paths, we find that the total phase change is 2π times the algebraic sum of the strengths of the singularities. The choice of an appropriate path can therefore yield, for field reversal, phase change (2n + 1)π, where n is any integer.

Finally we draw attention to the fact that the effects reported in ref.[\cite=wagh], as well as the singular effects described above have been seen in optical interference experiments using polarization states of light as the two-state system [\cite=rbdirac] [\cite=iwbs] [\cite=rbreview]. For example, when circularly polarized light passes through a pair of halfwave plates with principal axes at [formula] and [formula], the π-phase shift observed when the first is rotated through [formula] and the second through [formula] verifies Pauli anticommutation [\cite=anal]. A recently proposed generalized halfwave plate [\cite=uhwp] can verify all three Pauli anticommutations in a single experiment. ----------

Note Added:

Some of the landmark papers in the field, e.g. refs.[\cite=panch] [\cite=aa] [\cite=jsrb], while playing a key role in the development of the subject, define geometric phase as a quantity modulo 2π, in the process missing the physical significance and measurability of the phase discontinuities and 2nπ phases originating in singularities. This amounts to the proverbial "throwing away the baby with the bath", a fact that becomes particularly obvious when dealing with systems with more than 2 states, e.g. particles with spin > 1 / 2. The weight of conventional wisdom inherent in the above formulations has prevented the appreciation of the fact (and publication of this comment) that ±  2π phase shifts resulting from circuits around singularities have been observed in interference experiments with polarized light and are observable in neutron interference experiments . It may be pointed out that Samuel and Bhandari [\cite=jsrb] define the noncyclic geometric phase without the shortest geodesic rule for closing the open paths. The importance of this rule becomes obvious in ref.[\cite=jumps] which first introduced the phase jumps in the context of the geometric phase. See also the discussion on page 1403 of ref.[\cite=berrymo] which almost arrives at a π - phase jump but suddenly becomes silent !

In the experiment of ref. [\cite=wagh] analysed in this paper, the inadequacy of the "phase modulo 2π" becomes further transparent if one considered the same experiment with particles with spin angular momentum along the z-axis equal to n, n being an integer > 1. One would expect the measured geometric phase to follow a straight line beginning with a phase - nπ and ending at nπ. With the approach of ref.[\cite=wagh], one would never get such a straight line for the measured phase.

Note the nonlinear variation and change in sign of the phase.
