Unramified Alternating Extensions of Quadratic Fields

It is a folk conjecture that for n  ≥  5, all but finitely many quadratic number fields admit unramified extension fields of degree n whose normal closures have Galois group An, the alternating group on n symbols. Uchida [\cite=bib:uchida] and Yamamoto [\cite=bib:yamamoto] proved independently that there exist infinitely many real and infinitely many imaginary fields with unramified An-extensions. Our main theorem is the following refinement of this result; the case n  =  5 was previously obtained by Yamamura [\cite=bib:yamamura] using a different argument.

The idea is to construct monic polynomials P(x) with integer coefficients and squarefree discriminant Δ, so that [formula] is unramified over [formula]. To do so, we construct [formula] and set [formula]. Then the discriminant Δb of Pb(x) factors as

[formula]

since each factor is linear in b, a simple sieving argument shows that the discriminant is squarefree for a positive proportion of tuples [formula] in suitable ranges.

In order to make this program work, we must add constraints on the ai and b to ensure that various conditions are met. We first make sure that P(x) has integer coefficients. It suffices to require that a1 be of the form q / n with q an integer coprime to n but divisible by n - 1 and by all primes less than n not dividing n, that [formula] be integers divisible by n!, and that b be an integer coprime to n!. Now

[formula]

and so the coefficient of xm - 1 is divisible by m for [formula]. Consequently, Pb(x) has integer coefficients.

Next, we force Pb(x) to have a specific number of real roots, which determines the number of real embeddings of the field [formula]. By homogeneity, the number of real roots of Pb depends only on the tuple [formula]. Thus we can construct intervals (ci,di) and (c,d) such that if ai / m1 / n∈(ci,di) for all i and b / m∈(c,d) for some m, then Pb(x) has the desired number of real roots.

Next, we ensure that the splitting field of Pb(x) over [formula] has Galois group Sn. We do this by imposing congruence conditions modulo some auxiliary primes. Pick any degree n polynomial R(x) over [formula] with Galois group Sn such that the splitting fields of R(x) and R'(x) are linearly disjoint. Then by the Cebotarev Density Theorem, there exist infinitely many primes p1 and p2 such that R'(x) factors completely modulo p1 and p2, while R(x) is irreducible over p1 and factors into one quadratic factor and n - 2 linear factors over p2. We may impose congruence conditions on the ai and b so that [formula], which forces Pb(x) to have Galois group Sn over [formula].

Let us rewrite the factorization of Δb as

[formula]

The first term can written as qn plus a multiple of n, so is coprime to n; the remaining terms are each b plus a multiple of n, so are also coprime to n. Hence Δb is coprime to n. Also, if p is a prime less than n not dividing n, then [formula] and so none of the factors of Δb is divisible by p either.

For future convenience, we restrict [formula] to a very special form. We require them to be of the form [formula] for [formula] fixed once and for all and [formula] a prime. Then by homogeneity, we can write [formula] for some integers [formula]. By imposing congruence conditions on [formula] and b modulo the primes dividing [formula], we may ensure that no prime except possibly [formula] divides more than one of the factors P0(ai) + b.

Finally, we ensure that each factor of Δb is squarefree; this step is analogous to the proof that 6 / π2 of the positive integers are squarefree. (We have followed [\cite=bib:hooley] in this stage of the argument.) Fix N and pick a prime [formula] such that ai / N1 / n(n - 1)∈(ci,di) for all i; we will sieve over integers b such that b / N1 / (n - 1)∈(c,d). As noted above, the only prime that can divide more than one of the factors P0(ai) + b and P0(aj) + b is [formula]. Thus we must exclude [formula] of the possible values b in the range of interest.

Under this restriction, the factors P0(ai) + b are pairwise coprime, so it suffices to ensure that each one is squarefree for a positive proportion of b among the values of interest. Let S denote the set of b for which b / N1 / (n - 1)∈(c,d) and no P0(ai) + b is divisible by [formula]. Let N0  =  |S|, let N1 denote the number of b∈S such that each P0(ai) + b is squarefree, let N2 denote the number of b∈S such that no P0(ai) + b is divisible by the square of any prime less than [formula], and let N3 denote the number of b∈S such that P0(ai) + b is divisible by the square of a prime greater than [formula]. These are related by the equation

[formula]

Now N2 can be written, by inclusion-exclusion, as a sum over squarefree numbers l whose prime factors are all less than ξ. Any such number is at most N1 / 2(n - 1), so, with μ(l) denoting the Möbius function at l and d(l) the number of divisors of l, we have

[formula]

As for N3, we have the estimate

[formula]

Putting this together, we conclude that a positive proportion of b∈S yield squarefree Δb.

We now have produced O(N1 / (n - 1) unramified An-extensions of prescribed signature over quadratic fields of discriminant at most N. Moreover, the number of distinct values of Δb occurring is also O(N1 / (n - 1)). Thus at least this many quadratic fields of discriminant less than N admit unramified An-extensions of the desired signature.

We have not attempted to obtain the best possible exponent in the theorem; by varying [formula], one ought to be able to get an exponent of 2 / n. It may be possible to do even better by allowing [formula] to lie not in [formula] but in a larger number field.
