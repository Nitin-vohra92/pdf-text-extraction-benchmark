Introduction

Two classical scalar fields are minimally coupled to gravity in the Kachru-Shulz-Silverstein scenario [\cite=KSS] with a rolling fifth radius. One of these fields is time-dependent only, while the other is the dilaton. We consider the most general four-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic Robertson-Walker metric [\cite=MTW] (with a time-dependent scale factor), naturally generalized to a five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum [\cite=RS] context. We find a Tolman wormhole solution [\cite=Tolman] for a [formula] brane with Lorentz metric and for [formula] brane with positive definite metric. The solution represents a collapsing Universe which starts expansion just before encountering a big crunch singularity. The Universe reaches a moment of minimal spatial volume. This minimum volume edgeless achronal spacelike hypersurface is called a bounce [\cite=Visser]. The wormhole is time-dependent and the bounce involves the entire Universe. Our analysis will be along the lines of the one in [\cite=KP].

The Model

The action for gravity coupled to two scalars is:

[formula]

where:

[formula]

Here, [formula] is the pull-back of the five-dimensional metric [formula] to the domain wall taken to be at r = 0. The wall is represented by a delta-function source with coefficient V(φ), parametrising its tension. The scalar φ(t,r) is:

[formula]

We make the ansatz that both the potentials U and V are of Liouville type:

[formula]

and that the metric is:

[formula]

This is a natural generalisation of the most general four-dimensional homegeneous and isotropic Robertson-Walker metric [\cite=MTW] to a five-dimensional Randall-Sundrum context [\cite=RS]. The scale factor g(t) is a strictly positive function (we are working with a mostly-plus metric) and the function f(t) is strictly positive as well (the metric is never degenerate).The factors s and q are signs (s2  =  q2  =  1). The curvature parameter is ε  =    +  1 (for spherical spatial three-sections) or ε  =    -  1 (for hyperbolical spatial three-sections). The energy-momentum tensor for the scalar fields is:

[formula]

Einstein's equations Gμν  =  κ2Tμν, equivalently written in terms of the Ricci tensor as [formula], are:

[formula]

The tr-equation, ([\ref=tr]), implies:

[formula]

When [formula], the potential V(φ) can be written in the form:

[formula]

where W is a constant. Let us assume that the potential U(φ) can be written as a function of t and r in the separable form:

[formula]

At the end we will recast the potential U back into the original exponential form ([\ref=exp1]). Einstein's equations then reduce to:

[formula]

where C and D are separation constants. We will be looking for a bounce solution in the form:

[formula]

where B is a positive constant, not equal to 1 (so that the pull-back of the metric to 4 dimensions is flat only asymptotically), and h is another strictly positive constant. Upon substitution of the solutions ([\ref=solution]) into the Einstein's equations, ([\ref=1]) gives:

[formula]

On the otherhand, B must be positive. Therefore [formula] and ε and s must have opposite signs. Thus the solution is either a brane with spherical three-sections and Lorentz metric or a brane with hyperbolical three-sections and positive definite metric. Clearly, these two solutions can also be related by a Wick rotation (time t is changed to it and the positive-curvature spacetime becomes a negative-curvature spacetime). Einstein's equations ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=3]) are consistent if we choose

[formula]

where σ is a constant. The next Einstein's equation, ([\ref=2]), yields that the separation constant C is [formula] and that [formula]. The remaining time-dependent Einstein's equation, ([\ref=3]), gives [formula]. The r-dependent Einstein's equations ([\ref=4]) and ([\ref=5]) yield:

[formula]

and these two equations reduce to a single equation:

[formula]

A solution of this equation is of KSS [\cite=KSS] type:

[formula]

where k is a constant, such that [formula]. Therefore ε and q must have the same signs (k2  =  4 / 3). The constant W in brane tension V is - 12k. The equation of motion for the scalar field:

[formula]

after integration over the fifth dimension in an infinitesimal interval, gives a jump condition acrross the brane:

[formula]

Let us now write the potential [formula] back in the exponential form   U  =  U0eαφ  . Substituting the solution ([\ref=A]) for A(r) into ([\ref=u1]) gives:

[formula]

Using this form of U1(r), together with ([\ref=u2]) for U2(t) and the value of B, we easily find that:

[formula]

For a realistic model, one has to choose h sufficiently small.
