Introduction

Recently, a metric-free formulation of the classical electromagnetic theory and its axiomatics has been discussed by Hehl and Obukhov, see refs. [\cite=metric1] [\cite=book]. The basic quantities in this formalism are the electromagnetic excitation 2-form H, directly related to the sources of the field, and the field strength 2-form F, describing the effects of the electromagnetic field on electrically charged test currents. The Lorentz force density [formula] acts on test currents, were J is the electric current 3-form. The 2-forms H and F satisfy Maxwell's equations, dH = J, dF = 0. Field strength and excitations are not independent, but related by the so-called spacetime relation H = H(F); see refs. [\cite=book] [\cite=foundem] [\cite=post] for details.

The spacetime relation, expressing the properties of the underlying spacetime, will in particular determine the dynamical properties of the electromagnetic field. In this way, it is the analogous of the constitutive law, determining the the dynamical properties of the electromagnetic field in material media. The correspondence between electrodynamics in a gravitational field and in material media have been studied before, see for instance refs. [\cite=gordon] [\cite=leonhardt].

Here we consider the case of a linear spacetime relation, where H is proportional to F. In terms of coordinate components, the field strength will be denoted as [formula] and the excitation 2-form as [formula]. Then, the most general linear spacetime relation can be written in terms of the electromagnetic spacetime tensor density χijkl (of weight + 1), as

[formula]

where f is a dimensionfull scalar such that χijkl is dimensionless. The spacetime tensor density has the following symmetries:

[formula]

Note that the above formalism is metric-independent. As a particular example, however, one can recall the case of the coupling of the electromagnetic field to gravity in Einstein's theory, i.e. minimal coupling to the metric tensor gij. This corresponds to the following particular electromagnetic spacetime tensor density [\cite=post],

[formula]

which we do not assume to hold. Rather, we want to derive this equation from the linear ansatz ([\ref=linear]).

Closure relation

With the spacetime tensor available, we may define a duality operator # acting on 2-forms by extending ([\ref=dual]) to any 2-form [formula] such that

[formula]

In refs. [\cite=metric1] [\cite=book] [\cite=metric] spacetime tensors satisfying a so-called closure relation have been studied, namely those with

[formula]

This additional condition can be motivated by considering the electric-magnetic reciprocity of the energy-momentum current. Indeed, the closure relation results from assuming ([\ref=linear]) to be electric-magnetic reciprocal, provided we choose f such that f2φ2 = 1. Note also that in the particular case ([\ref=chig]) this condition is only fulfilled for metrics with Lorentzian signature.

In order to find the solutions of ([\ref=cr1]), it is convenient to adopt a more compact bivector notation by defining the indices [formula]. In this notation, χijkl corresponds to a symmetric [formula] matrix χIJ and the totally antisymmetric ε-tensor density becomes

[formula]

We define a new matrix κ by

[formula]

As [formula], any solution of the closure relation is given by a real 6  ×  6 matrix κ fulfilling

[formula]

provided [formula] is symmetric.

We decompose the matrices χIJ and [formula] into [formula] block-matrices,

[formula]

with symmetric matrices A and B, and T denotes matrix transposition.

Then the closure relation, ([\ref=cr1]) or ([\ref=kappa2]), translates into

[formula]

A consideration of the following disjoint subcases will provide the general solution of the closure relation: 1) B regular, 2) B singular, but A regular, and 3) A and B singular.

Solutions of the closure relation

B regular

We construct the general solution of ([\ref=eins])-([\ref=drei]) for the case in which det B  ≠  0. Under these conditions ([\ref=zwei]) is solved by

[formula]

with an arbitrary antisymmetric matrix K. Using this solution for C, we rewrite ([\ref=eins]) as

[formula]

so that the solution for A is given by

[formula]

The symmetry of A, as assumed in ([\ref=block]), may easily be seen in eq.  ([\ref=symma]) below.

A short calculation shows that the solutions ([\ref=c1]) and ([\ref=a1]) satisfy also ([\ref=drei]) identically:

[formula]

Therefore, the solution of the closure relation can be written as

[formula]

provided det B  ≠  0. This solution consists of 9 independent parameters: 3 from the antisymmetric matrix K and 6 from the nonsingular symmetric matrix B.

The solution previously found in ref. [\cite=metric], eq. (14), is equivalent to ours, as a simple calculation using computer algebra shows

[formula]

with K = (Kab) = (εabckc), N = (Nab) = (kakb), q =  - 1 /  det B, and p =  - 1 + tr(NB) /  det B.

B singular, A regular

In this case ([\ref=s1]) is not valid, but one can find a solution following a similar procedure, now starting with an arbitrary non-singular matrix A. We solve ([\ref=drei]) with respect to C and then use that result to solve ([\ref=eins]) with respect to B. In this way the solution can be found to be

[formula]

Here L is again an arbitrary antisymmetric matrix, with components L = (Lab), Lab = :εabclc.

This solution has 8 independent parameters: 3 from the antisymmetric matrix L and 6 from the nonsingular symmetric matrix A, fulfilling the constraint det B = 0. The constraint reads explicitly

[formula]

or, equivalently, det (A) - Aablalb = 0, as one finds after some algebra.

A and B singular

Finally, we analyse the case in which both det B = 0 and det A = 0. For simplicity, we will work in the basis in which the symmetric matrix B is diagonal. Since B is singular, we can choose the basis such that B0  =  diag(0,b22,b33). After inserting this ansatz into equations ([\ref=eins])-([\ref=drei]), one finds that at least one of the two eigenvalues of B must vanish, otherwise there is no real solution. Furthermore, at least one of the eigenvalues of B must be different from zero. Otherwise, if B = 0, eq. ([\ref=eins]) would imply C2 =  - 13 which has no solution with a real 3  ×  3 matrix. Then, we choose the basis such that B0  =  diag(0,0,b33), with b33  ≠  0. We denote the solution in this particular basis as A0,B0 and C0. Using this form of the matrix B, one is able to find, after some algebra, that the equations ([\ref=eins])-([\ref=drei]) admit the following four parameter solution:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

No real solution exists if c12 = 0. The general solution can thus be found from this special one by a similarity transformation:

[formula]

Here S is an arbitrary regular matrix which keeps A and B symmetric. This means that S has to be orthogonal (see for instance ref.  [\cite=fischer], p. 297). Therefore, the general solution has 7 independent components, due to the 3 additional parameters corresponding to the orthogonal transformation. These 7 independent components are thus in agreement with the 9 independent components of the regular solution, provided one takes into account the two conditions det A  =   det B = 0.

The orthogonal group O(3) is given by the direct product of parity transformations P and the special orthogonal subgroup SO(3). We just have to consider SO(3) transformations as parity transformations leave the solution invariant. We consider the parametrization of SO(3) based on the generators of rotations with respect to the Cartesian axes,

[formula]

Any matrix S∈SO(3) is given by

[formula]

Hence, the general solution for this case is given by

[formula]

The extraction of the metric

The regular solution of the closure relation

For a regular matrix B, the metric has been extracted in two independent ways up to a conformal factor. The first method [\cite=metric1] [\cite=metric] makes use of two formulas by Urbantke, see refs. [\cite=Urban1] [\cite=Urban2]. On the other hand, Obukhov et al. [\cite=wavemetric] have studied the propagation of electromagnetic waves for the most general case of a linear constitutive relation, see ([\ref=dual]). They found that the wave covector, qi, describing the propagation of wave fronts, fulfills a fourth order equation

[formula]

with

[formula]

This fourth order Fresnel equation is found to reduce to an equation of second order in the case of the regular solution ([\ref=s1]) of the closure relation ([\ref=cr1]), i.e.

[formula]

The factor [formula], with g: =  det (gij), is necessary since χijkl is a tensor density of weight + 1 so that Gijkl is also a tensor density of weight + 1.

As gij  qiqj = 0 defines the lightcone at each event, one can read off the metric coefficients from ([\ref=lightcone]), up to a conformal factor. In this case, the resulting metric, obtained by the two different methods, reads

[formula]

with ka: = Bab  kb. It can be shown that gij has Lorentzian signature. For details see refs. [\cite=metric1] [\cite=metric].

Solution for regular A and singular B

After evaluating ([\ref=4metric]) and ([\ref=gijkl]) for the solution ([\ref=s2]), we find that the Fresnel equation ([\ref=4metric]) also separates. From it, we read off the components of the metric up to a conformal factor. We find

[formula]

where we have defined lc: = Aacla. Again, this metric has Lorentzian signature, since g: =  det (gij) =  -  det A- 2 < 0.

The degenerated case

Finally, for our special solution ([\ref=a3])-([\ref=c3]), we find that ([\ref=4metric]) also separates. The corresponding metric, up to a conformal factor, is found to be

[formula]

The determinant in this case is g =  - b- 233c- 412 < 0, so that the metric has Lorentzian signature, as in the previous cases.

In order to study the case of solution ([\ref=simi]), we look how the quantities, in particular Gijkl as defined in ([\ref=4metric]), change under the orthogonal transformation S.

From ([\ref=block]) and ([\ref=simi]) one can write the corresponding transformed spacetime tensor density as

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

From ([\ref=gijkl]) we find the corresponding expression for the transformed tensor density Gijkl. Since det (Λi j) = 1, it takes the simple form

[formula]

Using this transformation law, one can easily prove the following: For orthogonal transformations ([\ref=simi]) and ([\ref=simi4]), the tensor density Gijkl reduces the forth order Fresnel equation to the light cone equation, see ([\ref=lightcone]), provided the tensor density Gijkl0 does. Thus, we find that the resulting transformed metric can be written in terms of the initial one in the form:

[formula]

We do not give here the explicit expression for this metric. We observe however that it has 7 independent components, and a Lorentzian signature.

Conclusions

By completing a recent analysis, we found a 1-to-1 correspondence between spacetime tensors fulfilling the closure relation and the conformally invariant part of metric tensors with Lorentzian signature. A new, more instructive proof for the regular solution ([\ref=s1]) is given.

In all cases, we checked the following important property: We took the conventional Hodge dual of a 2-form with respect to the metric we derived. This coincides with the action of the duality operator #, defined in terms of the spacetime relation, fulfilling the closure relation. In other words, we have derived ([\ref=chig]) from our linear ansatz ([\ref=linear]), the latter of which is constrained by the closure relation ([\ref=cr1]).

This result, previously found only for regular sub-matrices A and B, is then valid for all solutions.
