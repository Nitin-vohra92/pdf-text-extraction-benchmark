Hopf bimodules are modules over a diagonal crossed product algebra

Introduction

Let H be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra. In [\cite=cr] C. Cibils and M. Rosso introduced an algebra [formula] having the property that Hopf bimodules over H* coincide with left X-modules. This algebra X was further used in [\cite=t] by R. Taillefer who proved that if M and N are (finite dimensional) Hopf bimodules over H* then the Gerstenhaber-Schack cohomology groups H*GS(M,N) are isomorphic to Ext*X(M,N). The multiplication of X is a "twist" of the one of [formula], and it was also proved in [\cite=cr] that X is isomorphic to the direct tensor product between a Heisenberg double and (the opposite of) a Drinfel'd double.       In this paper we introduce two algebras, Y and Z, with the same property as X (Hopf bimodules over H* coincide with left modules over Y or Z) but which are more "structured" than X. Namely, Y is the two - sided  crossed  product (in the sense of F. Hausser and F. Nill [\cite=hn]) [formula], and Z is the diagonal crossed  product (also in the sense of Hausser and Nill) [formula]. We also write down explicit isomorphisms between the algebras X,Y,Z having the property that if M is a Hopf bimodule over H* then the actions of X,Y,Z on M correspond via these isomorphisms.       Let us mention that, among these three algebras, our favourite is Z, because the formulae for its multiplication and action on a Hopf bimodule look more elegant than in the other two cases. However, our approach relies on the structure of the algebra Y and the use of "three corners" Hopf modules.       Also, let us note that, as a consequence of the Maschke-type theorem for diagonal crossed products (see [\cite=HN], Th. 8.2) it follows that if H is semisimple and cosemisimple then Z is semisimple, so we obtain a proof for the semisimplicity of X independent on the isomorphism [formula].

The algebras X,Y,Z

Throughout, k will be a fixed field and all algebras, linear spaces etc. will be over k; unadorned [formula] means [formula]. For coalgebras and Hopf algebras we shall use the framework of [\cite=sw]. In particular for coalgebras we shall use Σ-notation: [formula], [formula] etc.       In what follows, H will be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra with antipode S. We start by stating some results which are either well-known (see for instance [\cite=mon]) or easy to prove.       If A is a left H-module algebra, that is A is an algebra and also a left H-module with action denoted by [formula] and such that [formula] and h  ·  1A  =  ε(h)1A for all h∈H and a,b∈A, the (left) smash product A  #  H is the algebra structure on [formula] given by

[formula]

A left A  #  H-module may be identified with a vector space M which is a left H-module and a left A-module (actions denoted by [formula] and [formula]) related by the following compatibility condition:

[formula]

for all h∈H, a∈A, m∈M.       If B is a right H-module algebra, that is B is an algebra and also a right H-module with action denoted by [formula] and such that [formula] and 1B  ·  h = ε(h)1B for all h∈H and a,b∈B, the (right) smash product H  #  B is the algebra structure on [formula] given by

[formula]

We are not interested in right H  #  B-modules, but also in left H  #  B-modules. One can check that a left H  #  B-module may be identified with a vector space M which is a left H-module and a left B-module (actions denoted by [formula] and [formula]) related by the following compatibility condition:

[formula]

for all h∈H, b∈B, m∈M.       If A is a right H-comodule algebra, that is A is an algebra and a right H-comodule with structure map [formula] which is an algebra map, we can consider the categories AMH and MHA of relative Hopf modules (see [\cite=mon], p. 144). It is well-known (see [\cite=doi]) that the category AMH may be identified with the category of left A  #  H*-modules (A becomes a left H*-module algebra as usual). Also (see [\cite=mon]) MHA may be identified with the category of right A  #  H*-modules, but we need to identify it with a category of left modules, and this may be done as follows: since A is a left H*-module algebra, Aop becomes a right H*-module algebra with action given by a  ·  p = S(p)  ·  a for all a∈A and p∈H*, where we denoted also by S the antipode of H*. Then one can prove that MHA may be identified with the category of left modules over the right smash product H*  #  Aop.       We are interested in the categories of Hopf modules H*H*MH* and H*MH*H* (see for instance [\cite=sch]) and mainly in the category of Hopf bimodules H*H*MH*H* (introduced for the first time in [\cite=nic]). We have the obvious identifications:           H*H*M [formula] [formula]            H*MH*H*≃ [formula] where H* becomes a right [formula]-comodule algebra via the map [formula], [formula].       Let A be a left H-module algebra and B a right H-module algebra (with actions denoted by [formula] and [formula]). The two - sided  crossed  product A  #  H  #  B, introduced by F. Hausser and F. Nill in [\cite=hn], is an algebra structure on [formula], given by

[formula]

(the unit is 1  #  1  #  1). Obviously the natural maps from H,A,B,A  #  H,H  #  B to A  #  H  #  B are all algebra maps.       Define the category (A,H,B) - mod to be the category whose objects are vector spaces M which are left A-modules, left H-modules and left B-modules, with actions denoted by [formula], [formula], [formula], related by the compatibility conditions: (i)      b  ·  (a  ·  m) = a  ·  (b  ·  m) [formula] [formula] for all a∈A,b∈B,h∈H,m∈M. The morphisms are the maps which are A-linear, H-linear and B-linear. Let us also note that the conditions (ii) and (iii) above are respectively equivalent to

[formula]

[formula]

Now we can describe the category of left A  #  H  #  B-modules. Proof: The identifications are given as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and conversely

[formula]

for all a∈A,h∈H,b∈B,m∈M. We shall only prove that the formula (a  #  h  #  b)  ·  m = a  ·  (h  ·  (b  ·  m)) gives indeed a left A  #  H  #  B-module structure on M provided (i), (ii) and (iii) are satisfied, and leave the rest to the reader. We calculate: [formula] (using (i)) [formula] (using (ii)) [formula] (using (iii)) [formula], q.e.d.

From the above discussion it follows that a left A  #  H  #  B-module is a left H-module M which is also a left A-module and a left B-module such that a  ·  (b  ·  m) = b  ·  (a  ·  m) for all a∈A,b∈B,m∈M and such that M is also a left A  #  H-module and a left H  #  B-module.       Define the algebra [formula], where H* is a left [formula]-module algebra with action

[formula]

for all h,h'∈H and f∈H*, where [formula] and [formula] are the regular actions of H on H*, given by [formula], [formula], and H*  op is a right [formula]-module algebra with action

[formula]

So, the multiplication in Y is given by:

[formula]

[formula]

where the multiplications on the last two positions are made in H and H* (not in Hop and H*  op).       Now we come to Hopf bimodules. It is clear that a H*-Hopf bimodule is a left [formula]-module M (i.e. a H*-bicomodule) which is also an H*-bimodule and such that M is an object in the categories H*H*MH* and H*MH*H*. Regarding the right H*-module structure of M as a left H*  op-module structure, it is clear that a  ·  (b  ·  m) = b  ·  (a  ·  m) for all a∈A = H* and b∈B = H*  op.       Now, from the identifications [formula] M [formula] and from all the above, we obtain finally:       We write down explicitly the Y-module structure of a Hopf bimodule M∈H*H*MH*H*. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the H*-bimodule structure of M and by [formula], [formula] the H*-bicomodule structure of M (the left [formula]-module structure of M is then given by [formula]). Then the action of Y on M is given by: [formula] for all p,q∈H*, h,g∈H and m∈M.       Recall now from [\cite=cr], [\cite=t] the structure of the algebra X of Cibils and Rosso (we write it for H*, that is in the formulae in [\cite=cr] and [\cite=t] one has to take A = H*). The algebra structure of X is [formula], where the multiplication is defined such that the first two and last two tensorands keep natural multiplication, [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

If M is a Hopf bimodule over H*, with notation as above, M becomes a left X-module with action given by:

[formula]

Now, if we look at this formula and the one of the action of Y on M, it is quite clear how to define an algebra isomorphism between X and Y, such that the actions on M correspond. Proof: We shall only prove that

[formula]

[formula]

and leave the rest of the computations to the reader. We calculate: [formula], q.e.d.

Recall from [\cite=hn] the definition of the diagonal  crossed  product (which, in a slightly different form, appears also in [\cite=wl] under the name right  twisted  smash  product). If C is an H-bimodule algebra with actions denoted by [formula] and [formula], the diagonal crossed product is the following associative algebra structure on [formula]:

[formula]

This structure is denoted by [formula]; its unit is [formula] and it contains [formula] and [formula] as subalgebras.       As noted in [\cite=wl], a linear space M is a left [formula]-module if and only if it is a left H-module and a left C-module with actions [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] (the [formula]-module structure of M is then given by [formula]).       If A is a left H-module algebra and B is a right H-module algebra, it was proved in [\cite=hn] that [formula] is an H-bimodule algebra with actions [formula] for all a∈A,b∈B,h,g∈H, and the map [formula] given by

[formula]

is an algebra isomorphism, with inverse [formula], given by

[formula]

From the description of modules over two-sided crossed products and over diagonal crossed products one can see that left modules over A  #  H  #  B coincide with the ones over [formula] and that f(a  #  h  #  b)  ·  m = (a  #  h  #  b)  ·  m for all a∈A,b∈B,h∈H and m∈M, where M is such a module.       We have seen that H* is a left [formula]-module algebra and H*  op is a right [formula]-module algebra, so we can consider the diagonal crossed product [formula], whose multiplication may be written as:

[formula]

[formula]

(where, as above, the products in the second and fourth positions are in H* and H, not in H*  op and Hop).       From the above discussion, the modules over Z are also the same as Hopf bimodules over H*, and the algebras Y and Z are isomorphic via the maps α:Y  →  Z, α- 1:Z  →  Y,

[formula]

[formula]

Hence, the algebras X and Z are also isomorphic, via the maps β:X  →  Z, β- 1:Z  →  X, [formula], [formula], that is

[formula]

[formula]

and, if M is an H*-Hopf bimodule, the actions of X and Z on M correspond via these isomorphisms. The action of Z on M is given by
