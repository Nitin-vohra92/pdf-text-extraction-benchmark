1. Introduction

Systems describing pairwise interactions on n particles in one dimension are important for several reasons. At the classical level they provide interesting examples of integrable models (see Ref. [\cite=per] for a review) and exhibit intriguing relations with semisimple Lie algebras [\cite=per] and Hamiltonian reductions of 2d Yang-Mills theory [\cite=gor]. At the quantum level they turn out to be completely solvable (see e.g. Refs. [\cite=op2],[\cite=vas] and references therein).

Apart from the mathematical concern in the chain of the one-dimensional many-body systems, some of them admit interesting physical applications. It has been known for a long time that the n-particle Calogero model [\cite=cal] characterized by the potential [formula], with g being a dimensionless coupling constant, exhibits conformal invariance [\cite=reg]. Exploiting the latter Gibbons and Townsend argued recently [\cite=gib] that an N = 4 superconformal extension of the Calogero model could be relevant for a microscopic description of the extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole, at least near the horizon. Unfortunately, beyond the two-particle case [\cite=gal] no such model has been constructed so far.

Generally, one works within the framework of supersymmetric (quantum) mechanics, where an attempt to incorporate superconformal generators leads one to contradictory equations [\cite=wyl]. Surprisingly enough, in d = 2 the situation turns out to be simpler [\cite=ghosh] and an N = 4 superconformal Calogero model can be constructed. However, a naive dimensional reduction to one dimension breaks N = 4 down to N = 2.

It is worth mentioning also the approach of Ref. [\cite=dprt], where an N = 4 supersymmetric multidimensional quantum mechanics involving an arbitrary potential has been constructed. However, no specific choice for the potential that would reproduce the Calogero model has been presented.

In the present paper we suggest a simple method for constructing variant N = 4 superconformal many-body theories out of a composite system containing one free particle (describing the center of mass) and [formula] copies of the conventional N = 4 superconformal mechanics [\cite=ikl] [\cite=ikL]. The approach appeals to a specific reduction where one imposes constrains on an original (simple) model in order to generate a nontrivial potential for a resulting reduced system. As will be discussed in detail below, the key point is not to destroy the standard structure of a kinetic term (i.e. [formula]) when implementing the reduction. As an application we construct an N = 4 superconformal extension for a complexification of the Calogero model and extend the D(2,1|α)-invariant mechanics of Ref. [\cite=ikL] to the n-particle case.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we illustrate the method and show how the reduction works to yield the purely bosonic Calogero model. In Sect. 3 we incorporate N = 2 supersymmetry in the scheme and reproduce the earlier result by Freedman and Mende [\cite=FM]. It turns out to be most efficient to work off-shell and implement constraints directly in a superfield form. Sect. 4 is split into three subsections respective to three different N = 4 off-shell superconformal multiplets known. Here we construct the two models mentioned above and comment on the problems one reveals when trying to apply the method for constructing an N = 4 superconformal extension for the real Calogero model. Possible further developments are outlined in the concluding Sect. 5.

2. The bosonic Calogero model

Before we treat in detail the entire superconformal case, it is worth illustrating how the reduction works for bosonic systems, the simplest conformally invariant many-body theory being the three-particle Calogero model in one dimension. To this end, let us consider the composite theory which involves a free particle and three copies of conformal mechanics [\cite=aff] with the (dimensionless positive) coupling constants being equal to each other

[formula]

The free particle degree of freedom has a distinguished status and is reserved for the center of mass coordinate of a resulting many-body conformal model to be derived below. Being a composite system, the theory ([\ref=start]) possesses an invariance which is the direct product of four SO(1,2) groups. Aiming at the construction of a many-body interacting theory exhibiting a single conformal symmetry, let us reduce the model ([\ref=start]) to the plane in the configuration space at hand

[formula]

This constraint can be readily enforced by means of the Lagrange multiplier π, the reduced action functional acquiring the form

[formula]

We next wonder which is the dynamics of physical degrees of freedom in the reduced theory. Applying the standard Dirac method one finds

[formula]

as the primary constraint and Eq. ([\ref=plane]) as the secondary one. Besides, there appear two tertiary constraints

[formula]

whose conservation in time fixes the Lagrange multiplier λπ entering the canonical Hamiltonian

[formula]

Its explicit form is irrelevant for the subsequent consideration.

It is important to notice that only a specific linear combination of the original conserved charges

[formula]

leaves the constraint surface ([\ref=plane]),([\ref=con1]),([\ref=con2]) invariant. Together with the Hamiltonian ([\ref=hamil]) they form the conformal algebra so(1,2) modulo the constraint terms.

Alternatively, working in the Lagrangian framework one could observe that the coordinates of each individual particle entering the original composite system transform linearly and homogeneously with respect to the proper SO(1,2) group

[formula]

In fact, it is this observation which prompts one to impose the linear constraint ([\ref=plane]) and guarantees the residual "diagonal" conformal symmetry for the reduced system.

Being second class, the constraints revealed above can be resolved after introducing the Dirac bracket. This allows one to remove the pair (π,pπ) and, say (x3,p3), from the consideration, while brackets for the remaining variables prove to have the following form (only the non vanishing brackets are given):

[formula]

It is then easy to find an invertible change of variables (x0,x1,x2)  →  (q1,q2,q3) which diagonalizes the bracket ([\ref=bracket])

[formula]

with {qi,pqj}D  =  δij. Being rewritten in terms of the new variables, the equations of motion coincide with those following from the Hamiltonian

[formula]

which is precisely the Hamiltonian of the three-particle Calogero model.

Thus, starting from the simple system composed of a free particle (the center of mass) and three copies of the conformal mechanics and applying the reduction ([\ref=plane]) one produces the three-particle Calogero model with the pairwise interaction in one dimension.

Our analysis above relies upon the rigorous Hamiltonian procedure. However, the same conclusion can be reached in a simpler way if one just solves the constraint ([\ref=plane])

[formula]

immediately in the Lagrangian ([\ref=start]), with x0 being the center of mass, x0 = q1 + q2 + q3. It is worth mentioning that a peculiar feature of the reduction used is that it preserves the kinetic term, i.e. [formula].

Obviously, the method is general enough and is applicable to any n-particle system with a potential of the form [formula]. For example, the n-particle Calogero model with the harmonic oscillator potential

[formula]

can be obtained from a composite system which contains a free particle and [formula] copies of the conformal mechanics which are modified by the inclusion of the harmonic oscillator potential

[formula]

The aforementioned reduction is implemented with the help of the relations

[formula]

The variables x obey [formula] linear constraints which leave one with n physical degrees of freedom [formula] and the Calogero action functional ([\ref=harmcal]).

The fact that one can treat the n-particle Calogero model as a specific reduction of a simpler composite system is not just the matter of aesthetics. It is well known that conformal transformations characterizing the model [\cite=aff] are compatible with N = 2 sypersymmetry [\cite=ap] and N = 4 supersymmetry [\cite=FR] [\cite=ikl]. The trick described above suggests quite new and intriguing possibility to attack the problem of a superconformal generalization of the n-particle Calogero model. It suffices to start with a composite system involving a superconformal extension of a free particle and [formula] copies of the superconformal mechanics [\cite=ikl] and apply an appropriate reduction. In the next section we treat in detail the N = 2 case. N = 4 models are discussed in Sect. 4.

3. N = 2 superconformal Calogero model

We next wonder how to incorporate N = 2 supersymmetry in the reduction scheme outlined above. In analogy with the bosonic case, in order to guarantee a residual superconformal symmetry for a reduced system, one is to impose constraints on the coordinates which transform linearly and homogeneously under the superconformal group. This suggests, in particular, that one should work with superfields because, in general, after eliminating auxiliary fields supersymmetry transformations become nonlinear.

Thus, our starting point is the N = 2 superconformal mechanics [\cite=ap] [\cite=ikl] which is described by the superfield action functional

[formula]

Here [formula] is a bosonic N = 2 real superfield and the covariant derivatives are defined in the usual way [formula], [formula], [formula].

The action ([\ref=n2scm]) holds invariant with respect to the following transformations

[formula]

where the superfunction [formula] collects all the infinitesimal parameters of the N = 2,d = 1 superconformal group

[formula]

Here f(t) is the same as that in Eq. ([\ref=cm4]) above, h is a U(1) rotation parameter, while ε and β correspond to the Poincaré and conformal supersymmetries, respectively.

Aiming at the construction of an N = 2 superconformal Calogero model, let us consider a composite system which involves an N = 2 superconformal extension of a free particle and n(n - 1) / 2 copies of the N = 2 superconformal mechanics discussed above

[formula]

where Xij =  - Xji and [formula]. Alike the bosonic case, we then impose the reduction constraints which express n(n - 1) / 2 + 1 original superfields X0,Xij in terms of n new superfields Vi

[formula]

As each of the superfields X0,Xij transforms linearly and homogeneously with respect to the proper SU(1,1|1) transformation, the constraints ([\ref=n2hamred]) hold invariant under the residual SU(1,1|1) group acting in a uniform way on all the superfields

[formula]

Thus, a residual N = 2 superconformal symmetry is guaranteed by the construction.

Implementing the reduction directly in the action functional of the composite system ([\ref=n2cal1]) one gets the following N = 2 superconformal n-particle model with the pairwise interaction

[formula]

Eliminating the auxiliary fields [formula] with the use of their equations of motion one can formulate the model in terms of the physical degrees of freedom

[formula]

where qi  =  Vi|θ = 0, ψi = iDVi|θ = 0 and [formula]. Being rewritten in the Hamiltonian form, the latter theory coincides with the N = 2 superconformal Calogero model constructed by Freedman and Mende in the framework of many-body supersymmetric quantum mechanics [\cite=FM].

Thus, we indeed checked that the reduction scheme advocated in the previous section can incorporate the N = 2 supersymmetry. Obviously, one can employ this reduction, in order to build supersymmetric many-body systems with a potential of a more general form [formula]. It suffices to start with a proper composite system.

4. Calogero-type models with N = 4 superconformal symmetry

The situation becomes more complicated when one tries to extend the analysis, in order to incorporate N = 4 supersymmetry. Let us remind first that the N = 4 superconformal group in d = 1 is the exceptional supergroup D(2,1|α) [\cite=FrSorba]. Only for specific values of the parameter, namely α =  - 1,0 (with the notation from Ref. [\cite=bils]), the corresponding superalgebra is isomorphic to [formula]. Generally, only the su(1,1|2) part is taken into account, while the su(2) subalgebra is kept explicitly broken. Besides, three different N = 4 off-shell supermultiplets are known, which can be used for constructing N = 4 superconformal Calogero-type models. The first multiplet contains one real scalar, four real fermions and three real auxiliary fields [\cite=ikl]. We shall call this the 4a multiplet. The second multiplet involves one complex scalar, four real fermions and one complex auxiliary scalar [\cite=ap] [\cite=FR]. We will call this the 4b multiplet. Finally, it was recognized recently that a multiplet with three real scalars, four real fermions and one real auxiliary field [\cite=IS] [\cite=BP] [\cite=MSS] underlies a new version [\cite=ikL] of an N = 4 superconformal mechanics (for the case of a vanishing coupling constant, see also Ref. [\cite=bgik]). We will call the latter the 4c multiplet. It is important to stress that in all three cases the N = 4 superfields involved are subject to constraints. Therefore, one should check that the proposed reduction is compatible with those conditions.

Keeping all this in mind, we proceed to construct N = 4 superconformal Calogero-type models.

4.1 The 4b multiplet

The 4b multiplet proves to be the simplest multiplet to handle. It underlies the following N = 4 superconformal mechanics [\cite=ap] [\cite=FR] [\cite=ikl]

[formula]

where the N = 4 superfields [formula] are constrained to obey the chirality conditions [formula], [formula] which involve the covariant derivatives [formula], [formula], a = 1,2.

The SU(1,1|2) symmetry characterizing the theory is realized in the following way

[formula]

where the superfunction [formula] collects all the parameters of the SU(1,1|2) group. Here we made use of the notation f = a + bt + ct2, εa(t)  =  εa  +  βat, [formula], tL = t + iθ and tR = t - iθ.

Owing to the homogeneous transformation law ([\ref=4btr]) for Y and [formula], one can safely use this model as a constituent of a larger composite system. As before, the latter is taken to be the sum of a kinetic term for the superfield Y0 (g = 0) and n(n - 1) / 2 extra terms of the form ([\ref=4baction]) with Yij =  - Yji. Imposing the reduction constraints on such a composite system

[formula]

where Vi denote n new independent superfields obeying the same chirality conditions [formula], Dai = 0, one ends up with the superfield action functional

[formula]

By construction this holds invariant under the "diagonal" SU(1,1|2) transformations which act in a uniform way on all the superfields Vi,i.

In order to clarify the status of this model, we eliminate auxiliary fields and go over to physical components

[formula]

where qi  =  Vi|θ = 0,   =  i|θ = 0, χia =  - iDaVi|θ = 0, [formula]. As is seen from the component action, the theory at hand describes an N = 4 superconformal extension of a complexification of the n-particle Calogero model. It is worth noting that taking a real slice of the latter theory one breaks the N = 4 supersymmetry and, hence, an N = 4 superconformal real Calogero model can not be constructed in this way. We will return to this issue later on in Sect. 4.3.

4.2 The 4c multiplet

This model is based on a recently proposed version [\cite=ikL] of an N = 4 superconformal mechanics. In the bosonic sector the system contains a dilaton field together with two variables parameterizing the two-sphere S2  ~  SU(2) / U(1). It was suggested in [\cite=ikL] that this variant of the superconformal mechanics is a disguised form of a charged superparticle moving in AdS2  ×  S2 background. Inspired by the use of the n-particle Calogero model in the context of black hole physics [\cite=gib], in this section we extend the system to the n-particle case.

The starting point is the superfield action functional

[formula]

which depends on the parameter α characterizing the supergroup D(2,1|α), the latter being the symmetry group of the model. The superfield v entering the problem is an unconstrained bosonic N = 2 superfield, while the N = 2 superfields ρ and [formula] are taken to obey the chirality conditions D = 0, [formula] Altogether they form an irreducible N = 4 supermultiplet [\cite=IS] [\cite=BP] [\cite=MSS].

The fact that v,ρ, transform linearly and homogeneously under the action of the D(2,1|α) supergroup allows one to use this theory for the construction of a composite system and then apply to the latter the reduction scheme. Omitting the details we expose the resulting action functional

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and the superfields i(ρi) are chiral (anti-chiral).

As formulated in Eq. ([\ref=4cCalg]) above, the action functional exists for generic values of the parameter α . Notice, however, that only for α = 1 / 2 the kinetic term takes the standard flat form. In what follows we concentrate on this particularly interesting case for which the action functional is simplified drastically. After eliminating auxiliary fields with the use of their equations of motion one finds the resulting component action

[formula]

where the physical components are defined as follows vi = vi|θ = 0, ρi  =  ρi|θ = 0, ξi = Dvi|θ = 0, ψi = Dρi|θ = 0 and we made use of the notation ρij  =  ρi  -  ρj, vij = vi - vj, ψij  =  ψi  -  ψj, ξij  =  ξi  -  ξj.

To summarize, the model constructed in this subsection can be viewed as an N = 4 superconformal Calogero-type model in three dimensions.

4.3 Troubles with the 4a multiplet

Being the most interesting multiplet in view of the conjecture of Ref. [\cite=gib], this case turns out to be the most difficult to handle. In the framework of the Hamiltonian formalism the trouble has been revealed already in Ref. [\cite=wyl] (see also the related work [\cite=gal]). In order to encounter the problem in our setting, let us recall the form of the action functional of an N = 4 superconformal mechanics which relies upon the multiplet at hand [\cite=ikl] [\cite=ikp]

[formula]

Here mαβ is a constant SU(2) vector which plays the role of a coupling constant, whereas the N = 4 superfield u is constrained to obey the equation

[formula]

Because the superfield u transforms linearly and homogeneously with respect to the supergroup SU(1,1|2) one can still try to use this theory in the context of the procedure we developed in the preceeding sections. As an outcome of this one finds the action functional

[formula]

where, as before, [formula], [formula] and all the superfields vi satisfy the constraints ([\ref=2acon]). A simple inspection then shows that the kinetic term of the component action includes a non-trivial coupling to a specific metric and thus the model fails to reproduce the real Calogero model in the bosonic limit. A way out could be to perform the reduction not in terms of the superfield u, but rather [formula]. In other words, one can pass to the new variable [formula] in the action ([\ref=4a]) and then apply the same reduction as before for the newly introduced superfields. Unfortunately, this step proves to be incompatible with the constraints ([\ref=2acon]) which are of the second order in the covariant derivatives. Thus, for the 4a multiplet our reduction fails to produce an N = 4 superconformal extension of the real Calogero model.

5. Concluding remarks

To summarize, in this paper we implemented a new reduction mechanism and constructed Calogero-type models with extended superconformal symmetry starting from simple composite systems. As was mentioned above, the range of possible applications of the scheme is actually larger than just the (super) conformal theories. Whenever the constraints preserve the standard structure of a kinetic term, a many-body system with the general potential [formula] can be constructed. Using this variant of the reduction we built an N = 4 superconformal extension for a complexification of the Calogero model and a D(2,1|α)-invariant n-particle system.

Turning to possible further developments it seems interesting to study whether the reduction proposed in this work allows one to generate solutions for a reduced n-particle model proceeding from those characterizing an initial simple composite system. A related question is whether the D(2,1|α)-invariant many-body theory constructed in this paper is integrable. It is also interesting to examine the range of applicability of this scheme in the context of two-dimensional field theory.
