Abstract: We show that if A is a d-dimensional abelian variety in a smooth quadric of dimension 2d then d = 1 and A is an elliptic curve of bidegree (2,2) on a quadric. This extends a result of Van de Ven which says that A only can be embedded in [formula] when d = 1 or 2. Mathematics Subject Classifications (1991): Primary, 14K05; secondary, 14E25, 14C99.

Introduction.

Let A be a d-dimensional abelian variety embedded in [formula]. It is well known that 2d  ≤  N. Moreover, in [\cite=van] Van de Ven proved that the equality holds only when d = 1 or 2.

It is a natural question to study the possibilities for d when the abelian variety A is embedded in any other smooth 2d-dimensional variety V. In particular, here we study the embedding in smooth quadrics. We obtain the following result:

We will use similar methods to Van de Ven's proof. The calculation of the self intersection of A in the quadric and the Riemann-Roch theorem for abelian varieties allow only the cases d = 1,2,3.

The case d = 1 is the classical elliptic curve of type (2,2) contained in the smooth quadric of [formula].

When d = 2, A is an abelian surface in [formula]. We see that is the projection of an abelian surface [formula] given by a (1,7) polarization. By a result [\cite=lazarsfeld] due to R. Lazarsfeld, this is projectively normal and it is not contained in quadrics. Therefore, A is not contained in quadrics either.

Finally, two results [\cite=iyer1], [\cite=iyer2] of J.N.Iyer allow us to discard the case d = 3.

Proof of the Theorem.

Let [formula] be an embedding of a d-dimensional abelian variety into a 2d-dimensional smooth quadric, with d > 1. The Chow ring of the smooth quadric in codimension d is generated by cocycles α and β with the relations α2  =  β2 = 1, α.β = 0. Thus, A will be equivalent to aα  +  bβ and

[formula]

On the other hand, by the self-intersection formula ([\cite=hartshorne], pag 431) we have A.A = j*cd(NA,Q). To obtain cd(NA,Q), let us consider the normal bundle sequence:

[formula]

Since the tangent bundle of an abelian variety is trivial, we see that c(NA,Q) = j*(c(TQ)). We compute the class of the tangent bundle of a quadric in the following lemma:

Let [formula] be an n-dimensional smooth quadric in [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula] and H is a hyperplane in [formula].

Proof: We have an exact sequence:

[formula]

Since Q is a hypersurface [formula] and the total class of the normal bundle is [formula]. On the other hand, it is well known that [formula]. Now, from the splitting principle the claim follows. [formula]

Let us apply this lemma to the previous situation. We obtain

[formula]

where [formula]. In particular, the top class is

[formula]

Substituting this into the self-intersection formula, we have:

[formula]

Combining this expression with (1) we obtain the following relation

[formula]

or equivalently,

[formula]

We are interested in bounding the degree of A, when (a,b) satisfy this equation. Note that this is a circle of center [formula] and radius [formula]. Since deg(A) = a + b, it is clear that the maximal degree is reached when (a,b) = (Fd,Fd), that is,

[formula]

On the other hand, the abelian variety is embedded in [formula]. When d > 2, by Van de Ven's Theorem, it spans [formula]. Furthermore, by the Riemann-Roch theorem for abelian varieties, we know that [formula]. Thus, we have the following inequality:

[formula]

Comparing the two bounds we see that a sufficient condition for the non-existence of the embedding j is Fd < (d + 1)!. Now,

[formula]

We see that (d + 1)! > 23d + 1  ≥  Fd when d = 17. A simple inductive argument shows that this holds if d  ≥  17.

If d  ≤  17, using the exact value of Fd, we see that (d + 1)! > Fd for any d > 3.

We conclude that the unique possibilities are d = 2 or d = 3.

First, suppose that A is an abelian surface contained in a quadric. F2 = 7 and we can check that the unique positive integer solution of the equation (2) is a = b = 7. Thus A must be an abelian surface of degree 14 given by the polarization (1,7). Note that [formula] is not linearly normal, that is, it is the projection of a linearly normal abelian surface [formula]. The quadric Q can be lifted to a quadric containing the surface A'.

Lazarsfeld proved in [\cite=lazarsfeld] that a very ample divisor of type (1,d) with d  ≥  13 or d = 7,8,9 is projectively normal. From this the following sequence is exact:

[formula]

Since [formula], there are not quadrics containing the abelian surface A' and we obtain a contradiction.

Finally, suppose that d = 3. Now, F3 = 24 = (3 + 1)!, so the degree of the abelian variety is exactly 2F3 = 48. The line bundle OA(h) corresponds to a divisor of type (1,1,8) or (1,2,4). But J.N.Iyer prove in [\cite=iyer1] that a line bundle of type [formula] is never very ample. Moreover, in [\cite=iyer2] she studies the map defined by a line bundle of type (1,2,4) in a generic abelian threefold. She obtains that it is birational but not an isomorphism onto its image. Note that the very ampleness is an open condition for polarized abelian varieties (see [\cite=dehusp]). It follows that a linear system of type (1,2,4) cannot be very ample on any abelian threefold and this completes the proof.

The sequence [formula] is related to the Fine numbers. For a reference see [\cite=deutsch].
