Superconductivity of the two-component non-stoichiometric compounds with incommensurate sublattices.

There exists a class of non-stoichiometric materials (berthollides) that can be considered as constituted by two sublattices, which have specific physicochemical properties [\cite=bib1]. Such nanocomposites, nanostructures, cluster lattices can be found among natural non-stoichiometric compounds and can be fabricated by filling the structure voids of the stoichiometric matrices by various matters. Zeolites, clathrates, and perovskites on the one hand and fullerides, modified zeolites, intercalated compounds etc on the other hand, constitute this class of materials. Fullerides and some zeolites have slightly analogous structures, MnC60 and Mn, for instance, where M stands for atoms, molecules, or clusters of the second component. Lattices of spheres of diameter about 1 nm composed from the carbon atoms or (Al,Si)O4 tetrahedrons are present in both cases. Octahedral voids of diameter about 0.4 nm between the spheres can ! be filled by the second component, elements of which Mn are well separated one from another. Only one atom M finds room in MeO6 octahedron tiny voids of perovskites. The second component atoms are located nearer with each other and can be considered as a weakly interacting sublattice ("subcondensate"). Specific properties of such systems stem both from the scale and geometric factors. Fullerides, for instance, not only have a large variety of normal properties, but also can be superconductors with Tc up to 40K. Many of their properties are discussed in [\cite=bib2].

Zeolite-based nanocomposites and nanostructures also demonstrate a wide spectrum of properties, which are not inherent to the isolated second component matter. The nonlinear conductance, para- and ferromagnetism, dielectric and optical properties, forming of new molecular structure etc. are typical examples of their features [\cite=bib3].

A variety of properties of perovskites are well known and are related to some positional freedom of the second component atoms and their mobility within the matrix voids. Perhaps, just this is a reason of appearance of superconductivity with Tc  =  91K in the tungsten-bronze NaxWO3 [\cite=bib4].

Sublattices of the components can be found obviously in a stressed state in these non-stoichiometric compounds due to possible misfit of their lattice constants. One of them will be compressed, and stretched another. The latter case is particularly important since an intermediate between the metal and the insulator state can appear that is of interest in the context of the high temperature superconductivity problem [\cite=bib5].

Being stretched, a lattice formed from divalent metal atoms can transit into the dielectric state due to ceasing of the electronic bands overlapping and opening of the energy gap. A MeB6 -kind compound is a typical example. If Me stands for a divalent atom, the MeB6 compound will be a dielectric, while it will be a metal in the case of a monovalent metal (at the room temperature) [\cite=bib6]. Metal atom sublattice not just doping ions is introduced into voids between B6 octahedrons. Stretching of the matrix, when the atomic diameter d0 exceeds the MeB6 lattice constant D, indicates this. (See also point II 3). The D / d0 ratio takes on the values for Me = Ce, La, Ca, Sr, Ba: Ce (0.414/0.326); La (0.415/0.374); Ca (0.415/0.395); Sr (0.419/0.430); Ba (0.427/0.434). The Ca sublattice is stretched and CaB6 is a dielectric. All of these compounds have close melting temperatures T  ~  2200K, which are determined by the matrix B6 [\cite=bib7].

Interatomic distances in the most of typical ionic compounds are assumed to be equal to the sum of ionic radii, which can be determined in a variety of ways (according to Pauling, Goldschmidt, etc.). However, even in such a compound as NaCl, the sum of ionic radii 0.092  +  0.154  =  0.246 is near to the sum of atomic radii 0.172  +  0.073  =  0.245. This implies that the Na atoms can demonstrate "atomic" properties even in the NaCl. The mentioned above ionic radii are rather arbitrary values [\cite=bib7]. The ionic radius values, calculated later quantum-mechanically [\cite=bib8], appeared to be noticeably less than the previously assumed: 0.087  +  0.074  =  0.151  <  0.245. This confirms reality of the atomic states even in such stoichiometric compound as NaCl (see, for example, the paper by Laves in [\cite=bib6]). This is all the more valid for non-stoichiometric compounds. This approach to Na-WO3 changes the electronic states picture in the crystal used in [\cite=bib4].

Stretching of the monovalent metal lattice by the matrix can lead to forming of the specific unique state intermediate between metal and dielectric [\cite=bib5].

If the lattice of monovalent metal atoms, located in the voids of diameter D larger than the atomic diameter d0 (D  -  d0  =  h  >  0), is stretched, then the atoms can occupy one of a few positions. Doubling of the metal sublattice period can occur in this case due to forming of the Me2 - molecules from the atoms in the neighboring voids. Their binding energy can be essentially lower than the metal cohesive energy. Nevertheless, the symmetry lowers and the energy gap appears in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The question arises if this gap is just dielectric or it is related to superconductivity [\cite=bib9]. Monovalent metals are not usually superconductors. However, superconductivity of the Na-WO3 compound appears due to introducing of the Na monovalent metal atoms into the WO3 matrix. This controversy can be eliminated, if we take into consideration that the period doubling is accompanied by forming of the molecular-like Na2 structures; their binding energy is determined by a contribution of the molecular orbital with two paired electrons.

We can calculate the energy gain at transition from usual monovalent metal to the "slightly stretched" one and estimate the energy gap magnitude. The cohesive energy of the stretched metal Na is Es  ~  1 / D, while we have for the usual Na metal E0  ~  1 / d0. The cohesive energy difference at the displacive phase transition Na1- Na2 is about

[formula]

Using the conventional values for parameters of the system Na-WO3:E0  =  1,  D  =  0.378,  d0  =  0.372 ,  h  =  0.006, we obtain ΔE  =  0.016  ~  187K. The molecular binding energy 0.35 eV is lowered up to 0.016 eV when Na2 molecule embedded into the WO3 medium. This well corresponds to dielectric susceptibility of about 20 both for NH3 and NdBa2Cu3O7

The available experimental data on Na-WO3 are in a good accordance with the considered above scenario. For example, the symmetry lowering by the lattice period doubling is really observed at transition from WO3 to Na-WO3 according to the x-ray study [\cite=bib1] [\cite=bib4]. Tetragonal phase domains appear in the cubic WO3 [\cite=bib1] [\cite=bib4]. The superconducting energy gap has been measured by the electron spin resonance technique and appeared to be equal 160-180K [\cite=bib4]. This confirms the presented above estimate for ΔE, which has been done using only the crystallographic parameters of the system and the energy E0. In addition, a suppression of the superconductivity at h  <  0 (see eq.[\ref=f1]) has been found experimentally as well. The compounds Rb-WO3 and Cs-WO3 demonstrate superconductivity only below   6K [\cite=bib4]. Rb (d0  =  0.496 nm) and Cs (d0  =  0.532 nm) atoms are strongly compressed in the WO3 voids. Cesium! , for instance, have Tc  ~  2K at P  =  10 GPa [\cite=bib10]. The parameter h  >  0.06 nm for the Li or Ag atoms (d0  ~  0.308   ΔE  /  E0  ~  0.1), but it is related to surprisingly high Tc. At a large crystallographic misfit, phase transitions of a different kind are possible, which change the matrix structure. Repeated attempts to discover superconductivity of the Na-NH3 solutions have been made according to [\cite=bib11]. The dramatic story of this study is described in [\cite=bib12]. Such solutions can be metastable at various stages of the phase segregation and contain groups Na2, Na3, ..... [\cite=bib5]. Possibly, just this feature allowed to freeze-in the magnetic flux in the sample only using fast cooling. Numerous attempts to obtain "diluted" metals vaporizing them at the NG atmosphere failed because of the fast phase segregation at the substrate. A similar scenario of the Jahn-Teller-Peierls transformations can be effected also in the case, when the introduced component stretches the matrix (see point I. 1) and its lattice constant D0 increases up to D. We have in this case

[formula]

The fullerides Men60 give an example of such system. Clusters Men60, located in the octahedral voids of the molecular crystal C60 expand the lattice of C60 spherical molecules and the lattice constant increases from D0 = 1.37 nm to D due to a decrease of the packing density [\cite=bib2]. The relation ([\ref=f2]) is valid for a wide variety of the alkali metals for n  =  3. Tc  =  40K (Fig.3 of Ref.[\cite=bib2]) at D  =  1.47 nm, E0  ~  0.1 eV. (E0 - part of intermolecular interaction ehergy determined by the electronic doping). Moreover, if n  =  4 or 6, the MenC60 crystal is dielectric [\cite=bib2]. The transition temperature Tc of fullerides is proportional to h / D0. ( For the tungsten-bronzes with Na, Rb, or Cs, Tc  >  0 at h  >  0, and Tc  ~  0 for h  <  0). The high temperature superconductors of the YBCO type also have a perovskite matrix composed from the CuO5 and CuO6 polyhedrons with voids filled by the metal atoms. For instance, Da  -  d0  =  0.39  -  0.36  =  0.03  Db  -  d0  =  0.02 NdBa2Cu3O7  (Tc  ~  95K). The Cooper pair binding energy can also depend upon dynamics of the "stretched" atoms in the matrix voids.

The totality of considered experimental data on superconductivity of a variety of systems of the matrix-filling type does not contradict a scenario, where a weak modulation of the monovalent metal lattice constant (h / d0  ~  ΔE / E0  ~  0.016 for Na-WO3) leads to forming of the bound electronic states of the molecular type and the energy gap. There are parallels between this result and both weak coupling BCS superconductivity and the Peierls transition, which is usually assumed to be only a transition to the dielectric state .
