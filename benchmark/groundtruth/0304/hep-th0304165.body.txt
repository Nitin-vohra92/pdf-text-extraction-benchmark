Recently, the so-called gauging iterative Noether Dualization Method (NDM) [\cite=1] has been shown to be effective in establishing some dualities between models [\cite=2]. This method is based on the traditional idea of a local lifting of a global symmetry and may be realized by an iterative embedding of Noether counterterms. However, this method provides a strong suggestion of duality since it has been shown to give the expected result in the paradigmatic duality between the so-called Self-Dual model and Maxwell-Chern-Simons in three dimensions (SD-MCS). This well-known correspondence was first established in detail by Deser and Jackiw [\cite=3], and may be shown by using a parent action approach [\cite=4].

In a recent paper [\cite=5] it was verified that, in calculating the dual of the modified eletromagnetic Maxwell Lagrangian, which includes Chern-Simons-like (that violates the Lorentz symmetry) and Proca terms, the corresponding propagator can be written as a simple relation with known propagators, namely:

[formula]

where 〈AμAν〉m corresponds to the propagator of the theory with the Proca term, 〈AμAν〉0 is the propagator of the gauge invariant theory (massless) and ωμν is the longitudinal spin operator [formula].

This result was obtained for a specific theory [\cite=5]. In this paper, we show that this is actually a general result and besides that the gauging iterative Noether Dualization Method leads us to a Lagrangian that describes the same physical particles at the expense of introducing non-physical excitations (ghosts).

The method consists in introducing an auxiliary field, Bμ, such that δBμ  =  δAμ  =  ∂μη, in order to restore gauge invariance:

[formula]

In the equation above, δL = JμδAμ, and δJμ = m2δAμ, by virtue of the Proca term. We should here stress that the latter relation is true whenever the Proca term is the only responsible for the breaking of the gauge symmetry. So, the variation of the Lagrangian LD with respect to Bμ leads us to

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Let us then consider the two Lagrangians

[formula]

and

[formula]

obtained after suitable partial integrations in their respective actions. Here, we have omitted the Lorentz indices in order to simplify. In the equation above, O and O0 are differential (local) operators corresponding to the theories with and without the Proca term, respectively, and obey the relation

[formula]

By applying now the NDM to the Lagrangian L we have

[formula]

The last step is done with the help of partial integration. The differential operator O has second-order derivatives or, like in the topological case, a first-order derivative contracted with the Levi-Civita tensor density. Equation (8) allows us to identify the Noether current as

[formula]

Now, we have to add to the Lagrangian

[formula]

where we again performed partial integrations. Our Lagrangian, then, becomes

[formula]

The complete wave operator can be finally identified as

[formula]

Using equation (7), we have

[formula]

so that

[formula]

The propagator is defined as [formula]. It is simple to invert OT, once we know the inverses of O and O0. For the O0-operator, it becomes necessary to add a gauge fixing term, [formula]. Therefore:

[formula]

with

[formula]

The inverse operator can then be readily written as

[formula]

Now, we wish to show that this inverse operator is nothing but the relation presented in equation (1). In order to do this, we use that

[formula]

and then multiply both sides of the above equation at the right by O- 1 and at the left by - 10, so as to obtain

[formula]

Now, the operators O- 1 and - 10 can be split in the form

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the index GI is to indicate gauge invariance. This gauge invariance, in momentum space, is expressed by the relations below:

[formula]

and

[formula]

So, since in momentum space the longitudinal spin operator is given by [formula], the last term in equation (19) will be read as

[formula]

where we have used that ω2  =  ω. Finally, it is found that

[formula]

or

[formula]

We then arrive at the decomposition proposed in eq. (1), which completes our demonstration. The result above is general and is not necessarily to be restricted to the dimension D=4. An inspection of equation (1) shows that all the poles of the original theory, and therefore all the physical excitations, are still present in the new propagator. However, it happens that the poles of the massless theory, that originates the propagator langleAμAν〉0, behave as non-physical excitations, for this propagator is ruled by a minus sign, yielding negative residue at its poles, which correspond to negative-norm states or, in other words, ghosts. This final result also clarifies the real meaning of the duality implied by the Noether Dualization Method: the dual theories do not display the same spectrum; they share the same physical sector of their respective spectra. As already shown above, the dual theory carries non-physical modes due to the minus sign in front of 〈AμAν〉0.
