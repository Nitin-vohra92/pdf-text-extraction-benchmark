COMMENT ON "PHASE TRANSITION-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN A LOW-PASS FILTER"

Krivine and Lesne use an example taken from The Feynman Lectures[\cite=Feyn] in an attempt to illustrate that "many interesting physical properties can however be missed because of the improper use of mathematical techniques".[\cite=paper] The supposedly incorrect mathematical procedure has to do with an ordering of limits. An infinite series that is convergent in the presence of a small parameter no longer converges when the parameter is set to zero before the series is summed.

The authors, correctly in my view, emphasize the physical importance of distinguishing between infinite systems and large finite systems. In their example discontinuities in certain physical quantities only exist (mathematically) for infinite systems.

I suggest, however, that the authors have demonstrated a different mathematical point than the one that they propose: infinite series live a life of their own and need not be constrained to be the limit of sequences of finite series. This point was made long ago by Borel and was probably known to Abel and Cauchy[\cite=Borel]. I emphasize the point with an example of an infinite series of resistive elements that sum to a negative resistance. The infinite series represents different physics from any of the possible finite series.

Let {Ri} be a set of resistors, each having resistance Ri = piR p > 1 and R an arbitrary resistance value. Then [formula] is the resistance of a set of such resistors connected in series, and the value of Zn grows without bound as n increases. Clearly, a quantity Z defined by [formula] makes no sense as a limit of a convergent sequence of finite sums.

We may, however, emulate Feynman[\cite=Feyn] and define Z from the recursive relation Z - R = pZ which follows from the definition of Z and the fact that an infinite series less a finite set of its members is still an infinite series. Solving the last equation for Z leads to the result that

[formula]

a negative resistance.

Feynman[\cite=Feyn] also shows us how to build such infinite-series resistors. One simply terminates a finite-series resistor having resistance Zn with a negative resistance having resistance  - pn + 1R / (p - 1). Each such resistor will then have negative resistance Z.

When the quantity p has values p < 1, there is no difference between the limit of a sequence Zn of increasing n and the value Z obtained in Eq. [\ref=Rneg]. This does not mean that Eq. [\ref=Rneg] is wrong, as the authors of Ref. 2 seem to imply. It does mean that the infinite sum involved represents two different physical situations when p < 1 and when p > 1, involving, respectively passive and active circuit elements.

This Comment is intended, however, to emphasize the mathematical fact that infinite (and infinitesimal) mathematical operations may be justified independently of arguments involving limits.[\cite=unlimits]
