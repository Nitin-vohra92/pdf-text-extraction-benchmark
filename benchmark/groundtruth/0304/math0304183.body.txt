1. Introduction. There are many papers in which a graph is constructed from a set in something like the following manner. For any positive integer m write [formula]. In this paper we will be interested in the two particular groups [formula] and [formula]. Example. Suppose that N is prime and let A be the set of quadratic residues modulo N. The graph GA is then called the Paley sum graph of order N, and is denoted by PN. It is generally thought that the Paley graphs behave much like random graphs from the binomial model G(N,1 / 2), though in many respects this statement is far from being proven. We remind the reader that in this model all (labelled) graphs on N vertices occur with equal probability. Equivalently, a graph from G(N,1 / 2) may be generated by picking each possible edge ij independently at random with probability 1 / 2. See [\cite=Boll] for the basic definitions of random graph theory (and much more). In the light of the above example it seems natural to address the following question. We call a graph generated using this model a random Cayley sum graph. The reader may have already noticed that there is one sense in which a random Cayley sum graph is definitely not like a random graph - it is always regular. However in a recent paper of Krivelevich, Sudakov, Vu and Wormald [\cite=KSVW] a good quantity of evidence was collected to support the claim that a random regular graph of degree N / 2 (say) behaves in many ways almost exactly like a random graph from the binomial model G(N,1 / 2). In this paper we will investigate just one aspect of Question [\ref=mainq], the clique number of a random Cayley sum graph. There are clearly other ways in which we might compare a random Cayley sum graph to a random graph. An investigation of the second largest eigenvalue, for example, leads naturally to some classical questions on random trigonometric polynomials. We discuss this matter in a separate paper [\cite=Green]. This is really a paper in combinatorial number theory. To see why, let A  ⊆  Γ and consider what it means for X  ⊆  Γ to span a clique in GA. We must have i  +  j∈A whenever i,j are distinct elements of X. Now the set {i  +  j:i,j∈X,i  ≠  j} is called the restricted sumset of X with itself and is normally written XX. Thus we see that X spans a clique in GA if and only if XX  ⊆  A. Now if X is highly structured, for example if it is an arithmetic progression, then |XX| is rather small compared to |X| and the probability that GA contains the clique spanned by X will be quite large. This does not mean, however, that the clique number of a random Cayley graph is very large since there are rather few arithmetic progressions. Let [formula], and make the following definition. Observe that Smk(Γ) is empty if m  <  k - 1. Now one can easily write down a formula for E(Γ,k), the expected number of k-cliques in a random Cayley graph on Γ. Indeed one has

[formula]

Now suppose we could show, for some function [formula], that E(Γ,F(N))  =  o(1). Writing ω for the clique number and Ωk for the number of cliques of size k we would then have

[formula]

by Markov's inequality. That is, the clique number of a random Cayley graph on Γ is almost surely at most F(N). As a result of these observations our attention is drawn to the problem of finding effective upper bounds for |Smk(Γ)|. Further notation and background. Let |Γ|  =  N and consider the sample space ΩN consisting of all graphs on N vertices. If E  =  EN is an event in this sample space then we write

[formula] for the probability that a random graph from G(N,1 / 2) satisfies E;

[formula] for the probability that a graph selected from GN,⌊N / 2⌋ satisfies E, where GN,⌊N / 2⌋ puts the uniform distribution on all the ⌊N / 2⌋-regular graphs on N labelled vertices;

[formula] for the probability that if A  ⊆  Γ is chosen randomly, then the Cayley sum graph GA satisfies E.

The following well-known result concerning the clique number of a random graph (see, for example, [\cite=Boll]) sets our later results in context. In this paper, all logs are to the base 2 unless otherwise specified. In [\cite=KSVW] the same result is proved for random regular graphs: Questions equivalent to estimating the clique number of a random Cayley sum graph appear in various places in the literature, such as [\cite=AAAS] [\cite=Alon] [\cite=AO] [\cite=Choi] [\cite=Ruzsa4]. To the best of my knowledge the following result, which is essentially given in [\cite=AAAS], is the best known. A similar result is mentioned in [\cite=AO], where it is remarked that it would be interesting to try and improve on it, and also, without proof, in [\cite=Ruzsa4]. Let us conclude this section by making a remark concerning our terminology. We use the term Cayley sum graph to make it clear that the objects we are considering are very slightly different from what are normally called Cayley graphs. In an abelian group Γ a (true) Cayley graph is formed as follows. Take a symmetric set A, that is to say a set in which a∈A implies that - a∈A. Form a graph on vertex set Γ by joining i to j if and only if i  -  j∈A. The group Γ acts on the resulting graph in an obvious way, and for this reason true Cayley graphs are perhaps more natural than Cayley sum graphs. From the rather number-theoretical point of view of this paper, however, the treatment of Cayley sum graphs seems to be a little tidier. The methods of this paper apply to true Cayley graphs with minimal modifications. When [formula], of course, the two types of graph actually coincide. 2. Statement of results. The main result of this paper is the following improvement of Theorem [\ref=thm4]. An immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=mainthm1] is the following result in Ramsey theory, for which we do not know an independent proof: The behaviour of random Cayley sum graphs on [formula] is different, reflecting the fact that this group has much richer subgroup structure. We will prove the following. We make no effort to optimise the values of C1 and C2 in this result. 3. Freiman isomorphism classes. A vital notion in this paper is that of a Freiman isomorphism. Let s be a positive integer, let A and B be subsets of (possibly different) abelian groups and let φ:A  →  B be a map. Then we say that φ is a Freiman s-homomorphism if whenever [formula] satisfy

[formula]

we have

[formula]

If φ has an inverse which is also a s-homomorphism then we say that it is a Freiman s-isomorphism, and write [formula]. This is the case precisely if [\eqref=eq271] holds for any ai,a'i satisfying [\eqref=eq272]. This is a standard and very convenient terminology in additive number theory. One must, however, be slightly careful: we invite the reader to consider the obvious map [formula], which is a one to one Freiman 2-homomorphism but not a Freiman isomorphism. In this paper we will mostly, but not exclusively, be concerned with Freiman 2-homomorphisms. From now on we will refer to these simply as homomorphisms. In order to discuss the theory of Freiman homomorphisms as cleanly as possible we introduce some further definitions. These are very much in the spirit of [\cite=LK], and indeed Lemma [\ref=lem12] below is a crude (though slightly more general) version of one of the results of that paper. Let F be a field, let k be a positive integer and let W be a vector space over F. Let Vk be a k-dimensional vector space over F with basis [formula]. For any sequence [formula] of k elements of W we can define a linear map φσ:Vk  →  W by

[formula]

If v∈ ker φσ then we say that v is satisfied by σ. Let s  ≥  2 be an integer. Call any vector of the form

[formula]

where the is and js need not be distinct, an s-relation. Write Rs for the set of all s-relations in Vk. If S  ⊆  Vk write (S) for the F-linear span of the elements of S. Now for any subset S and any subspace U of a vector space one has [formula]. Thus in particular

[formula]

That is to say, the set [formula] of s-relations satisfied by σ can be completely recovered from the subspace spanned by it. Proof. By [\eqref=eq273] we have [formula]. That is, the set of s-relations satisfied by σ and σ' are the same. An s-isomorphism between A and A' is therefore given by the map ai  ↦  ai'. Proof. Given any set [formula] we may form a sequence [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem2] the number of s-isomorphism classes of sets A is at most the number of subspaces of Vk spanned by s-relations. There are at most k2s of these s-relations, and any such subspace is spanned by some subset of at most k of them. The required bound follows. Now if W,W' are two vector spaces over F and if A  ⊆  W then the space s(A,W') of Freiman s-homomorphisms φ:A  →  W' is a vector space over F. We call rF(A)  =   dim 2(A,F)  -  1 the Freiman dimension of A. It is easy to see that dim 2(A,W')  =  (rF(A)  +  1)dim W'. In a short while we will prove the main result of this section, Lemma [\ref=lem4]. Let us first prepare the ground with the following lemma from linear algebra. Proof. Let [formula]. Choose as a basis for Ψ the set [formula] of maps defined by the conditions αi(aj)  =  δij. Now we may find some k  -  d of the αi which, when taken together with Φ, span the whole of Ψ. Relabeling if necessary we may assume that these elements are [formula], so that

[formula]

It follows that for any [formula] we may find φ∈Φ and [formula] so that

[formula]

implying that φ(ai)  =  fi ([formula]). To see that φ is unique, suppose that φ'(ai)  =  φ''(ai) for some φ',φ''∈Φ and all [formula]. Then [formula] and thus φ'  -  φ''  =  0 since the sum in [\eqref=eq771] is direct.

As for assertion (ii), observe that any x∈A induces a linear functional tx:Φ  →  F via the rule tx(φ)  =  φ(x). For a fixed a∈A the d + 1 linear functionals [formula] are linearly dependent and therefore we can find [formula], not all zero, so that

[formula]

for any φ∈Φ. If μ were equal to zero then we could easily contradict (i) by setting fi  =  1 and fj  =  0 for j  ≠  i. Therefore this is not the case and we may divide [\eqref=eq980] through by μ to get (ii) (with λi  =    -  μ- 1μi for [formula]). If the constant map lies in Φ then [\eqref=eq980] must hold for it, which implies that [formula]. Proof. Part (ii) and the first part of (i) are swift consequences of Lemma [\ref=lem4pre], (i). Although that lemma deals only with homomorphisms from A to F, the required extension follows easily using the isomorphism [formula].

To prove the second assertion of (i), suppose that suppose that φ∈2(A,W') is not a Freiman isomorphism. Then there are elements a,a',a'',a'''∈A such that φ(a)  +  φ(a')  =  φ(a'')  +  φ(a''') but a  +  a'  ≠  a''  +  a'''. By part (ii) there are ui,u'i,u''i,u'''i∈F such that [formula] for all ψ∈2(A,V), for any vector space V over F (and similarly for a',a'',a'''). One has

[formula]

for all ψ. Taking V  =  W and ψ  =   we see that not all of the ui  +  u'i  -  u''i  -  u'''i are zero. Therefore, setting V  =  W' and ψ  =  φ, one sees that [formula] must be linearly dependent. Proof. Apply Lemma [\ref=lem4] (ii) with W'  =  W and φ  =  . It follows that there are [formula] such that A is a subset of [formula], an affine space over F of dimension r. As rF(A) is clearly an isomorphism invariant, the same must be true of any set isomorphic to A and it therefore follows that d  ≤  r. To see that r  ≤  d, pick linearly independent vectors [formula] in some space W', and observe that A is isomorphic to some set containing all of the w'i by Lemma [\ref=lem4] (i). 4. Isomorphism classes with small doubling. As in the last section, let W be a vector space over a field F. The main result of this section is a bound for the number of mutually non-isomorphic sets A  ⊆  W of cardinality k with small (restricted) doubling property. The cardinality of AA is an isomorphism invariant and we say that an isomorphism class of sets has small doubling property if m  =  |AA| is relatively small in comparison to |A| for each set in that class. If B  ⊆  W and if t is a non-negative integer than a t-extension of B is simply any set [formula] where [formula] and the xi are distinct elements of [formula]. Proof. Let Q  =  ⌊k1 / 5⌋ and q  =  k- 1 / 15. Draw a graph on vertex set A by joining x to y if x  +  y is Q-unpopular, that is if the number of pairs (w,z)∈A2, w  ≠  z, with w  +  z  =  x  +  y is less than Q. The total number of edges in the graph is no more than Qm, and so some vertex [formula] has degree at most 2Qm / k. This means that with at most 2Qm / k exceptions the sums [formula], a∈A are Q-popular. Pick a set X  ⊆  A by choosing each a∈A to lie in X independently and at random with probability q. Let [formula]. If [formula] is Q-popular then there are at least Q / 3 disjoint pairs (b,c)∈A2 with b  +  c  =  s and b  ≠  c. For each the probability that both b and c lie in X is q2, and so

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Clearly we have [formula] and so

[formula]

Pick a specific X  ⊆  A for which |X|  +  k11 / 15|Z|  ≤  4k- 1 / 15m, and set A0  =  X, [formula]. Then |A0|  ≤  4k- 1 / 15m, [formula] and, by construction, [formula]. Proof. Write [formula]. Given A0  ⊆  A with the required properties write [formula] and [formula] in a manner that respects the 3-isomorphism between A0 and B; that is, for [formula]

[formula]

if and only if

[formula]

The isomorphism class of A is determined by the 2-relations in Vl + t satisfied by A. With each possible relation we can associate its projection w∈Vt onto the last t coordinates of Vl + t. There are at most t4 non-zero projections w; fix one of them, say [formula], and consider relations corresponding to this specific projection. If A satisfies such a relation, say

[formula]

with [formula], then all other such relations are uniquely determined: they correspond to the equalities ai2  +  ai3  -  ai1  =  aj2  +  aj3  -  aj1 with [formula], hence to the equalities bi2  +  bi3  -  bi1  =  bj2  +  bj3  -  bj1 with [formula]. Since there are at most l3 choices for the relation [\eqref=eq365], there are at most l3 choices for the whole system of relations corresponding to w which A satisfies. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that this conclusion is actually true for any possible w  ≠  0. The result follows on observing that to determine the system of relations in Vl + t, satisfied by A, we must for each non-zero w∈Vt determine the system of relations corresponding to w. The next lemma is an easy exercise. Proof. By Proposition [\ref=prop2], to any A  ⊆  Fk with |A|  =  k and |AA|  ≤  m there correspond [formula] and A0,A1  ⊆  A such that |A0|  ≤  4k- 1 / 15m, |A1|  ≥  |A|  -  4k- 4 / 5m and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem12], the number of possible 6-isomorphism classes to which A0 can belong is [formula]; let [formula] be representatives of these classes. By Lemma [\ref=lem36], the set [formula] is 3-isomorphic to a non-empty subset of some XiXi of cardinality at most k; consequently, the number of 3-isomorphism classes to which A1 can belong is at most Mk(em / k)k. By Lemma [\ref=extlemma], each of these 3-isomorphism classes gives rise, by t-extensions for any fixed t  ≤  4k- 4 / 5m, to at most exp (k29 / 30) isomorphism classes. Altogether, we get at most

[formula]

possible isomorphism classes for A. 5. Avoiding very small doubling. The bound of Proposition [\ref=prop18a] becomes rather ineffective when m  ≤  7k, say. This section contains a trick which allows us to avoid ever considering sets with extremely small doubling (see, however, the section entitled Concluding Remarks). The result we will actually use, Corollary [\ref=trickcor], is a consequence of the following more general proposition. Proof. Let [formula]. Choose a set B  ⊆  A by picking each element of k independently and at random with probability p. By some rather standard tail estimates (see, for example, [\cite=AlonSpencer]) we have

[formula]

Now for any x∈BB write s(x) for the number of ordered pairs (b1,b2)∈B2 with b1  ≠  b2 and b1  +  b2  =  x. The sum [formula] equals the number of quadruples (b1,b2,b3,b4)∈B4 with b1  +  b2  =  b3  +  b4 and b1  ≠  b2, b3  ≠  b4. We call these summing quadruples.

Let us divide the summing quadruples (a1,a2,a3,a4)∈A4 into two classes: those in which a1,a2,a3,a4 are all distinct and those in which either a1  =  a3,a2  =  a4 or a1  =  a4,a2  =  a3. Call this latter type degenerate; there are less than 2k2 degenerate quadruples in A4, and at most k3 non-degenerate ones. Now for a given quadruple, one can calculate the probability that it is also contained in B4. This probability is p4 if the quadruple is non-degenerate, and p2 otherwise. Thus

[formula]

It follows immediately that

[formula]

Comparing [\eqref=eq717] and [\eqref=eq737], we see that there is a specific choice of B for which

[formula]

Now the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives

[formula]

This, together with [\eqref=eq757] and a small amount of computation, shows that |BB|  ≥  (1  -  ε)k. Moreover we have, from [\eqref=eq757], that

[formula]

This completes the proof. Proof. Apply Proposition [\ref=trickprop] with ε  =  1 / 9. This supplies us with a set B, [formula], such that |BB|  ≥  8k / 9. Now simply take C to be the union of B and some arbitrary elements of A so as to ensure that |C| lies between k / 8 and 8k / 63. 6. The rank of sets with small doubling. In this section we obtain results concerning the Freiman dimension of sets A  ⊆  Γ with |A|  =  k and |AA|  =  m. It is in this section that the difference between different groups Γ comes to the fore. When [formula] we can relate A to a subset of the integers, but this is not possible for [formula] and, by necessity, we must find a different approach. Let [formula] have |A|  =  k and |AA|  =  m and consider the image [formula] of A under the least positive residue or "unfolding" map [formula]. This clearly has [formula] and [formula]. Thus we may apply the following result of Freiman [\cite=Fr]. Proof. Observe that [formula], this being a general property shared by all sets of k integers. Applying Lemma [\ref=FL], we have

[formula]

Proof. It suffices to count the number of lifts [formula] of sets [formula]. Let [formula] be a complete set of representatives of the isomorphism classes of subsets X of the integers with |X|  =  k and |XX|  ≤  2m. We always have M  ≤  k4k by Lemma [\ref=lem12] but, when m  ≤  k31 / 30 / 2, Proposition [\ref=prop18a] allows us to do better and we have the bound M  ≤  (2em / k)k exp (k31 / 32). Now each [formula] is the image of some Xi under some isomorphism [formula], and by Lemma [\ref=lem4] (i) there are at most [formula] such isomorphisms. The proposition follows immediately from these observations and Lemma [\ref=lemma22]. We now turn our attention to subsets of [formula]. An important tool will be the following consequence of an inequality of Plünnecke which was reproved by Ruzsa [\cite=Ruz]. If G is any abelian group and if X  ⊆  G then we write kX for the k-fold sum [formula] and kX  -  lX for the set [formula], where there are k - 1 plus signs and l difference signs. This allows us to get a bound on the Freiman dimension over [formula] of subsets of [formula] with small doubling. Proof. By Corollary [\ref=cor1] we may assume (by subjecting A to a Freiman isomorphism if necessary) that A is not contained in any affine subspace of [formula] of dimension less than [formula]. Let [formula] be an arbitrary ordering on [formula] and let h  =  ⌊ log ek⌋. Suppose that |A|  =  k and that |AA|  =  m, so that |A  +  A|  ≤  m  +  1 (we are in characteristic 2!), and let X  ⊆  A be a subset of A which is such that the sums [formula] ([formula]) are all distinct, and which is maximal with respect to this property. If |X|  ≥  h then we have, using Theorem [\ref=thm23],

[formula]

It follows immediately from this that

[formula]

Now the maximality of X implies that if we set [formula] for any [formula] then some two of the sums [formula], [formula] must be equal, where [formula] and [formula]. It is clear that precisely one of the yi's or y'i's must equal a, and so a∈hX  -  (h - 1)X. In particular, A is contained in the affine subspace of [formula] spanned by X. The required inequality follows. It is interesting to compare this with the estimate

[formula]

This bound, which follows from the work of Ruzsa [\cite=RuzFrei] on Freiman's theorem in torsion groups, is stronger than Lemma [\ref=mod2dim] when m / k  ≪  ( log k)1 / 3. Ruzsa and I, in work in progress, can improve this bound to something more like log k  +  2(m / k)2. It would be interesting to know the true behaviour: perhaps r  ≤   log k  +  Cm / k. Proof. This is slightly more straightforward than Proposition [\ref=ZNbound]. Let [formula] be a complete set of representatives of the isomorphism classes of sets [formula] with |X|  =  k and |XX|  ≤  m. Proposition [\ref=prop18a] gives bounds for M, and we know that any set [formula] is the image of some Xi under an isomorphism [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lem4], (i) and Lemma [\ref=mod2dim] allow us to bound the number of such isomorphisms. 7. Putting everything together. In this section we use Propositions [\ref=ZNbound] and [\ref=Z2bound] to give upper bounds for the sums

[formula]

when [formula] and [formula]. An application of Proposition [\ref=trickprop] will then allow us to prove Theorems [\ref=mainthm1] and [\ref=mainthm2]. We begin with Theorem [\ref=mainthm1]. Let k  =  ⌊20 log N⌋. Using ([\ref=bb1]) and ([\ref=bb2]) we have

[formula]

Now log (2eC) / C  -  1  ≤   - 0.2499 when C  ≥  7, and so both of the sums appearing here are bounded above by N- 2 for N sufficiently large. Now suppose that some randomly selected set [formula] contains XX with |X|  =  k. Then, by Proposition [\ref=trickprop], A contains some set YY where |Y|  ≥  k / 8 and |YY|  ≥  7|Y|. However if k  =  ⌈160 log N⌉ then the expected number of such sets Y that A contains is at most N- 2, and in particular the probability that it contains even one is o(1). It follows immediately that almost surely A does not contain any XX with |X|  =  ⌈160 log N⌉, and this is the claim of Theorem [\ref=mainthm1]. Similar computations apply for the group [formula], but now of course we use formulae ([\ref=bb1a]) and ([\ref=bb2a]) of Proposition [\ref=Z2bound] instead. Let k  =  ⌊11 log N log  log N⌋. One has

[formula]

Now log (eC) / C  -  1  ≤   - 0.39 when C  ≥  7, and so both sums appearing here are bounded above by N- 2 for N sufficiently large. The rest of the argument proceeds exactly as before, and one gets Theorem [\ref=mainthm2] (with C2  =  308). 8. A lower bound for [formula]. In this section we prove the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=mainthm2]. Throughout this section we write [formula] and N  =  |Γ|. Proof. Let k  =  ⌊ log n  +   log  log n  -  1⌋ and consider all k-dimensional subspaces [formula] of Γ, where

[formula]

For a random set A  ⊆  Γ let Xi denote the indicator function of the event [formula], and let [formula]. We have

[formula]

We will also estimate (X), and to do this it is necessary to prove a lemma. Proof of Lemma. We will show that the quantity in question is exactly

[formula]

which is easily seen to be at most 2n(2k  -  l). To make this count, first pick the intersection [formula] in any of

[formula]

ways. Then pick vectors [formula] so that [formula] and [formula]. The subspace L together with all the points ui,vi spans a subspace of dimension 2k - l, so the number of choices for the ui,vi is

[formula]

However, many of these choices will give the same subspaces Hi,Hj. If Hi,Hj are fixed and have [formula] then there are [formula] ways of choosing [formula] so that [formula], and the same number of ways of choosing [formula]. This completes the proof of the lemma. Now the covariance (Xi,Xj) is positive if and only if [formula] intersects [formula], which requires [formula]. Thus we have, using the lemma,

[formula]

Now one can check that 2l  -  nl  ≤  2  -  n for 1  ≤  l  ≤  k, and so

[formula]

Now Chebyshev's inequality tells us that

[formula]

which is o(1). This means that with probability 1  -  o(1) the set A contains some [formula]. Note, however, that [formula] is precisely HiHi. 9. Concluding remarks. It would certainly be of interest to determine the clique number of a random Cayley sum graph on [formula] asymptotically (almost surely). There are several points at which are argument leading to Theorem [\ref=mainthm1] was suboptimal. One was that we rather shied away from the issue of counting sets with extremely small doubling property, resorting instead to the trick of Proposition [\ref=trickprop]. It is possible to say rather more about these using Freiman's deep theorem [\cite=Fr], which says that such sets are economically contained in a multidimensional arithmetic progression. It was also rather wasteful to treat subsets of [formula] by using the unfolding map [formula] in such a naïve way. When N is prime, it is possible to prove the following result: By subjecting our set A to such a homothety one can ensure that the unfolding map induces a Freiman isomorphism, so that the lifting [formula] has [formula]. Proposition [\ref=prop18] may be called a rectification principle in the spirit of [\cite=BLR]. Using these results, and tidying up the approximations used in, for example, Lemma [\ref=lemma22], one can certainly reduce the number 160 drastically, and perhaps even to (3  +  ε). To do this would be difficult, and there seem to be some even more substantial obstacles to pushing the constant down to (2  +  ε), which seems likely to be the correct value. We may return to these issues in a future paper. Another issue deserving of remark arises from the result of Graham and Ringrose [\cite=GR], which implies that there is an absolute constant c such that, for infinitely many primes N, the clique number ω(PN) is at least c log N log  log  log N. However, using the Borel-Cantelli lemma together with the bounds obtained in § 7 one can show that almost surely any sequence (GN)N of random Cayley sum graphs on [formula], |GN|  =  N, will have lim sup N  →    ∞ω(GN) /  log N  ≤  160. Thus Paley graphs are (in a sense) not as good Ramsey graphs as random Cayley sum graphs. Let us close by mentioning a conjecture from [\cite=Alon]. The results of this paper confirm this conjecture for cyclic groups but one should not expect the full conjecture, if it is true, to be easy to prove. Quite apart from the fact that our methods seem to break down hopelessly for all but a few very special groups, the result of Proposition [\ref=prop47] shows that random methods alone will not suffice to attack Alon's conjecture. 10.
