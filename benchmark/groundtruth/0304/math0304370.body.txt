Brownian Intersections, Cover Times and Thick Points via Trees

Introduction

In [\cite=in], the author showed that long-range intersection probabilities for random walks, Brownian motion paths and Wiener sausages in Euclidean space, can be estimated up to constant factors by survival probabilities of percolation processes on trees.

More recently, several long-standing problems involving cover times and "thick points" for random walks in two dimensions were solved in joint works [\cite=cover] [\cite=planar] of A. Dembo, J. Rosen, O. Zeitouni and the author. These solutions were motivated by powerful analogies with corresponding problems on trees, but these analogies were not discussed explicitly in the research papers cited. The goal of the present note is to describe the tree problems and solutions, that correspond to the problems studied in [\cite=cover] [\cite=planar].

The cover time for a random walk on a finite graph is the number of steps it takes the random walk to visit all vertices. The cover time has been studied intensively by probabilists, combinatorialists, statistical physicists and computer scientists, with a variety of motivations; see, e.g., [\cite=bro] [\cite=mihail] [\cite=aldous2] [\cite=hil] [\cite=nemi]. The problem of determining the expected cover time Tn for the n by n lattice torus [formula], was posed by Wilf [\cite=wilf] and Aldous [\cite=aldous1]. In [\cite=cover] we proved the following conjecture of Aldous [\cite=aldous1].

If Tn denotes the time it takes for the simple random walk in [formula] to completely cover [formula], then

[formula]

The first step toward proving Theorem [\ref=theo-2lattice], was to find a sufficiently robust proof for the asymptotics of the cover time of finite b-ary trees. These asymptotics were originally determined by Aldous in [\cite=aldous-t], but his elegant recursive method was quite sensitive and did not adapt to the approximate tree structure that can be found in Euclidean space. Cover times on trees are discussed in the next section.

Turning to a different but related topic, Erds and Taylor (1960) posed a problem about simple random walks in [formula]: How many times does the walk revisit the most frequently visited site in the first n steps?

Denote by Tn(x) the number of visits of planar simple random walk to [formula] by time n, and let [formula] Then

[formula]

This was conjectured by Erds and Taylor [\cite=ET]. After D. Aldous heard one of us describing this result, he pointed us to his cover time conjecture, and this eventually led to Theorem [\ref=theo-2lattice]. Although the proofs of that theorem and of Theorem [\ref=ETlattice] differ in important technical points, they follow the same basic pattern:

Cover times for trees

Let Γk denote the balanced b-ary tree of height k, which has nk = (bk + 1 - 1) / (b - 1) vertices, and nk - 1 edges.

Denote by Ck the time it takes for simple random walk in Γk, started at the root, to cover Γk. Then

[formula]

Remark The expected hitting time from one vertex to another is bounded by the commute time, which equals the effective resistance times twice the number of edges (see, e.g., [\cite=Ald-F]). Therefore the expected hitting time between two vertices in Γk is at most 4knk. From a general result in [\cite=aldous3], it follows that also

[formula]

Proof of theorem [\ref=cover-bary] Denote by C+k the time it takes the walk to cover and return to the root, and by Rk the number of returns to the root until time C+k. By the remark preceding the proof, [formula], so to prove the theorem it suffices to establish that

[formula]

The expected time to return to the root is the reciprocal of the root's stationary probability b / (2nk - 2), so by Wald's lemma

[formula]

Thus the theorem reduces to showing

[formula]

We start by reproducing the straightforward proof of the upper bound. Denote by Rv the number of returns to the root of Γk until the first visit to v, and observe that Rk is the maximum of Rv over all leaves v at level k. At each visit to the root, the chance to hit a specific leaf v before returning to the root is 1 / bk, whence

[formula]

Summing over all leaves, we infer that

[formula]

Integrating over r > 0,

[formula]

This yields the upper bound in ([\ref=eq:R]). To prove a lower bound, Aldous [\cite=aldous-t] uses a delicate recursion, and an embedded branching process argument. Here we will give the shortest argument we know, which only involves an embedded branching process. Given λ  <   log b, our next goal is to show that

[formula]

Let Tλ be the number of steps until the root is visited λbk2 times.

Fix r∈(λ, log b), and choose [formula] large, depending on r. Let v be a vertex at level [formula] of Γk, and suppose that w is a descendant of v at level [formula].

Observe that the expected number of visits to v by time Tλ is λ(b + 1)k2, and the expected number of excursions between v and w by time Tλ is [formula].

Say that w is "special" if the number of excursions from v to w by time Tλ is at most [formula]. Note that vertices close to the root (i.e., at level [formula] where [formula]) are special with high probability, because r > λ. If [formula], then every visit to v is equally likely to start an excursion to w as to the ancestor of v at distance [formula] from v. Thus, if v is special then w is special with probability at least [formula], where X has binomial law with parameters [formula] and 1 / 2. By the central limit theorem, as j grows, [formula], where Z is standard normal. Since r <  log b, we find that [formula], if [formula] is large enough. Therefore, special vertices considered at jumps of [formula] levels (to ensure the required independence) dominate a supercritical branching process; the survival probability tends to 1 as k  →    ∞  , because vertices near the root are almost guaranteed to be special. This establishes ([\ref=low]). It follows that [formula] for large k, and since λ  <   log b is arbitrary, this completes the proof of ([\ref=eq:R]) and the theorem.

Remark The argument above is quite robust: it readily extends to family trees of Galton watson trees with mean offspring b > 1. With a little more work, using the notion of quasi-Bernoulli percolation (see [\cite=lyons] or [\cite=climb]), it can be extended to the first k levels of any tree Γ that has growth and branching number both equal to b > 1. The most robust argument, the truncated second moment method used in [\cite=cover], is too technical to include here.

From trees to Euclidean space

The following "dictionary" was offered in [\cite=in] to illustrate the reduction of certain intersection problems from Euclidean space to trees:

The Brownian analogs of Theorems [\ref=theo-2lattice] and [\ref=ETlattice], respectively, are given below. Throughout, denote by D(x,ε) the disk of radius ε centered at x.

For Brownian motion [formula] in the two-dimensional torus [formula], consider the hitting time of a disk,

[formula]

and the ε-covering time,

[formula]

which is the amount of time needed for the Wiener sausage of radius ε to completely cover [formula]. Then

[formula]

Denote by μw the occupation measure for a planar Brownian motion w(  ·  ) run for unit time. Then

[formula]

(This was conjectured by Perkins and Taylor [\cite=Perkins-Taylor].)

The basic approach used to prove these results, which goes back to Ray, [\cite=Ray], is to control occupation times using excursions between concentric discs. The approximate tree structure that is (implicitly) used arises by considering discs of the same radius r around different centers and varying r; for fixed centers x,y, and "most" radii r (on a logarithmic scale) the discs D(x,r) and D(y,r) are either well-separated (if r <  < |x - y|) or almost coincide (if r >  > |x - y|).
