In 1966, Kadanoff proposed an intuitive renormalization picture [\cite=Kadanoff66] to explain the Widom's phenomenological hypothesis [\cite=Widom65]. This hypothesis states a homogeneous transformation of the singular part of the free energy per spin under a change of length unit from 1 to b in the vicinity of the critical temperature Tc and can be written as

[formula]

where d is the integer space dimension of a translationally invariant system; the reduced temperature t = T / Tc - 1 and the external field h are supposed to be small; yt and yh are two exponents associated with the two relevant directions of the renormalization flows. One notices that a translationally invariant system of dimension d is auto-similar and can be considered as a particular case of fractal. In the case of a general fractal system, the translational symmetry is broken; however, a generalization of the space dimension can be done by introducing the Hausdorff dimension df. The number of spins on such system can be written as N = Ldf where L is the network size. Thus, the Widom's hypothesis can be generalized by replacing the factor b- d in Eq.([\ref=Widom_hypothesis]) by b- df to describe the decrease of the effective number of spins during the change of the length scale. Since fractals are constructed by iteration of a generating cell, b cannot take any value; it must be chosen so that the fractal structure remains invariant under the change of length unit. The critical behaviors of spin models on fractals whose Hausdorff dimension lies between 1 and 3 have been studied intensively by Monceau and Hsiao and co-workers [\cite=Monceau98] [\cite=Hsiao00] [\cite=Monceau01] [\cite=Hsiao02] and Carmona et al. [\cite=Carmona98], by performing Monte Carlo simulations. The results show the validity of the above generalization. More recently, a direct verification of the Kadanoff's real space renormalization group picture of the Ising model in the case of a Sierpinski fractal has been achieved by Hsiao and Monceau [\cite=Hsiao02_MCRG]; they used a Monte Carlo renormalization group method.

The simulation works mentioned above have been mainly performed with the help of the Monte Carlo Wolff algorithm [\cite=Wolff89a]. This algorithm is able to reduce efficiently the critical slowing down. Instead of involving a single-spin flip at each update of the spin state configuration, the Wolff algorithm grows firstly a cluster (so-called Wolff cluster) and then updates the state configuration by assigning a new state to the spins of this cluster. Much information on the critical behavior of a discrete spin system can be brought out from the geometrical properties of the Wolff clusters. It has been shown that the mean size of Wolff clusters for the Ising model scales as Lγ  /  ν at Tc where γ and ν are the critical exponents associated to the susceptibility and the correlation length [\cite=Wolff89a]. It provides an alternative way to calculate γ  /  ν. Monceau and Hsiao checked that the values of γ  /  ν calculated from the Wolff mean cluster sizes are consistent with the ones calculated from the behavior of the maxima of the susceptibility with respect to L in the case of the Sierpinski fractals with Hausdorff dimensions betweeen 1 and 3.[\cite=Monceau02] [\cite=Monceau03] Moreover, the most striking result they carried out is the scaling invariance of the Wolff cluster size probability densities P(s) under a suitable rescaling. This scaling law holds at the critical point and reads

[formula]

where s denotes the size of Wolff cluster associated with a Monte Carlo step and b is some appropriate change of length scale which keeps invariant the fractal structure. They proved that the exponent x is equal to yh  =  β  /  ν  +  γ  /  ν where β is the critical exponent associated to the magnetic moment. This scaling law can be understood as a decrease of Wolff cluster size by a factor byh under the change of the length scale 1  →  b. During the simulations of the Ising model, the total magnetization M and the total energy E are calculated at each update of the spin state configuration. As a matter of fact, the absolute difference |ΔM| between two successive values of M is equal to two times the size of the Wolff cluster grown during a Monte Carlo step. Hence, the scaling law described in Eq. ([\ref=Scaling_prob_s]) is satisfied by the probability density distribution of |ΔM|. It is worth noticing that the mean absolute difference |ΔE| between two successive values of the total energy represents two times the surface energy of the Wolff cluster. Thus, there is much to learn in studying the scaling properties of |ΔE| and the associated probability density distribution. The purpose of this paper is to study the behavior of the surface energy of Wolff clusters grown on fractal lattices at the critical point. We investigate seven different Sierpinski-type fractals of Hausdorff dimension lying between 1 and 3. The lattices are generated iteratively from some generating cells and denoted [formula]. [formula] is the size of the generating cell, d is the integer space dimension in which the lattice is embedded, nocc is the number of occupied sites in the generating cell, and k is the number of iteration steps. Ising spins are placed at each center of the occupied sites. The size of [formula] is [formula] and the number of spins is N = nkocc. The Hausdorff dimension is defined by [formula]. The true mathematical fractal is obtained only when k tends to infinity; in this case, we denote it by [formula]. The structure of the fractal is not indicated in these symbols. The seven generating cells [formula] we have chosen are

SP(22,4,1): a 2 by 2 square,

SP(32,8,1): a 3 by 3 square where the center sub-square is removed,

SP(52,24,1): a 5 by 5 square where the center sub-square is removed,

SP(23,8,1): a cube of size 2,

SP(33,26,1): a cube of size 3 where the center sub-cube is removed,

SP(43,56,1): a cube of size 4 where the center sub-cubes of size 2 are removed,

SP(33,18,1): one removes in addition the 8 sub-cubes at the corners of SP(33,26,1).

SP(22,4) and SP(23,8) are exactly a square and a cubic lattice of infinite size. It has been shown that the Ising model exhibits a second order ferromagnetic phase transition on a fractal, provided that the lattice has a particular geometrical property: the ramification order must be infinite [\cite=Gefen84]. It is the case for the fractals studied here. Moreover, the critical temperatures Tc on these fractals are available [\cite=Hsiao00] [\cite=Monceau01] [\cite=Binder01] [\cite=Baxter82] and their values are recalled in the table 1. The mean absolute value of the Wolff cluster surface energy can be calculated from the relation

[formula]

where Nsim is the total number of Monte Carlo steps and En is the total energy of the n-th updated configuration. Firstly, we found that 〈|ΔE|〉 follows power laws at Tc with respect to the lattice size L in the case of the seven different fractals we investigated. It enables to define a surface exponent: 〈|ΔE|〉  ~  LSW. Fig.1 shows the behavior of 〈|ΔE|〉 as a function of L in logarithmic coordinates. The points line up along straight lines except for the small sizes, where the scaling corrections due to the finite-size effects are expected. It has been suggested that these corrections have a topological character and are linked to the slow convergence towards the thermodynamical limit in the case of the fractals with broken translational symmetry [\cite=Monceau01]. As a matter of fact, 〈|ΔE|〉 follows perfectly a power law in the case of the translationally invariant lattices SP(22,4,k) and SP(23,8,k) where L increasing as a geometrical series covers many orders of magnitude. We report the measured surface exponent SW in the table 1, where least-square fits are performed from k = 8 to 12 for SP(22,4,k), from k = 5 to 8 for SP(23,8,k), from k = 4 to 8 for SP(32,8,k), from k = 2 to 4 for SP(43,56,k), from k = 3 to 5 for SP(52,24,k), for SP(33,18,k), and for SP(33,26,k), respectively. On the other hand, since Monte Carlo simulations can be performed only on lattices of finite size and we have omitted the small-size data when extrapolating the thermodynamical limit, a slow crossover behavior may be interpreted as an asymptotic one. A detailed study shows that the points in Fig.1 exhibit a very slight concavity. The reported value SW, hence, should be taken as an upper bound in a strict sense; however, the real thermodynamical-limit value is expected to be very close to the reported one.

We are now able to go further and study the scaling properties of the probability density distributions P(|ΔE|) of Wolff cluster surface energy. The curves showing P(|ΔE|) are similar to each other in logarithmic coordinates. These results suggest to write down a homogeneous transformation under the form:

[formula]

where DS and yS are some introduced exponents. An intuitive guess is to set DS equal to df - 1 since it describes the usual surface dimension of a system of bulk dimension df. According to Eq.([\ref=Scaling_prob_dE]), 〈|ΔE|〉 should scale as :

[formula]

where we have performed the change of variable |ΔE'| = b- yS|ΔE|. Since the correlation length is divergent at Tc, we can set b equal to the lattice size [formula]. 〈|ΔE|〉 is, therefore, proportional to L- (df - 1) + 2yS. We are, hence, able to obtain a relation linking the exponents SW and yS:

[formula]

The values of yS calculated from Eq.([\ref=S_W_y_S]) for the seven fractals investigated are given in the table 1.

The similarity property of the curves showing the probability density distributions P(|ΔE|) and the validity of the homogeneous transformation Eq.([\ref=Scaling_prob_dE]) can be brought out in the following way: for a given structure at different values of the iteration step k, the curves showing P(|ΔE|) collapse onto the one corresponding to the lattice of the largest size [formula] under the mapping:

[formula]

Fig.2 shows such collapses for the three largest values of k on the fractals SP(32,8), SP(22,4), and SP(33,18). These data-collapses work out in a reliable way with the values of yS given in Table 1. It confirms that DS is equal to df - 1 (It has also been checked for the four other fractals). Furthermore, P(|ΔE|) does not exhibit a peak as P(s) does. The effect of segregation between large and small clusters mentioned in Ref.[\cite=Monceau02] [\cite=Monceau03] is smoothed in the behavior of P(|ΔE|). It means that an important part of the simulation is carried out in updating large clusters; however, the update of the large clusters does not necessarily imply a large change of the total energy. For a given cluster size, the probability distribution of the border surface is broad.

A fundamental question is to know if the introduced exponent yS is a new one, that is, if it is independent of the two renormalization group eigen-exponents yt, yh and the Hausdorff dimension df. To our knowledge, it's the first time that the surface energy scaling property of Wolff cluster is investigated. No analytical or theoretical treatment is available. According to our Monte Carlo simulation results (table 1), yS seems to be independent of yt, yh and df. Whether yS links to some of the surface exponents of a bulk system [\cite=Binder83_Diehl86] remains an open question. In the table 1, regardless of the fractal structures, one can find that the values of yt, yh and yS increase as the Hausdorff dimension df increases. Moreover, we do not expect that ε-expansion results can be interpolated to non-integer dimensions and provide the values of yt and yh on the fractals, even the value of yS. Accurate Monte Carlo studies have shown that the universality of phase transitions on the hierarchical lattices without translational symmetry should depend on the lattice structure [\cite=Hsiao00] [\cite=Monceau01]. Hence, yS associated to the fractals with broken translational symmetry depends on the lattice structure too.

As the Wolff clusters are dynamical objects, we exploit here the connection between the surface exponent yS and the dynamical scaling exponent. We firstly study the mean square surface energy of Wolff cluster

[formula]

We find that 〈(ΔE)2〉 lines up along straight lines with respect to L except for the small lattice sizes in logarithmic coordinates for the seven fractals investigated (see Fig.3). The associated exponent u, defined by 〈(ΔE)2〉  ~  L2u, could be measured in the same way as described in the previous text for the exponent SW; the values of u are reported in the table 1. We, then, express 〈(ΔE)2〉 as [formula] where θEE(n) = (〈E0En〉  -  〈E〉2) / (〈E2〉  -  〈E〉2) is the normalized autocorrelation function. Since the autocorrelation time is much longer than 1 (in some appropriate time unit), 1 - θEE(1) represents approximatively the negative derivative of the autocorrelation function at the origin. It enables to define a statistic-fluctuation autocorrelation time τEsf and an associated dynamical exponent zEsf: - (dθEE(t) / dt|t = 0)  =  (τEsf)- 1  ~  L- zEsf.[\cite=Landau00] Notice that, according to Eq.([\ref=Widom_hypothesis]), the term 〈E2〉  -  〈E〉2 should asymptotically scale as Lα  /  ν + df = L2 / ν at Tc, where α is the critical exponent associated to the specific heat per spin cv. One should keep in mind that the non-singular part of the free energy per spin gives, in addition, an important contribution in determination of the critical behavior of cv [\cite=Hsiao00]. We, therefore, have 2u = 2ν- 1 - zEsf in the thermodynamical limit. With the help of the inequality [formula], we can link the surface exponent SW with the dynamical one zEsf in the following way: SW is upper bounded by u = ν- 1 - zEsf / 2. Moreover, since 〈(ΔE)2〉 follows a power law, a homogeneous transformation for the probability density of (ΔE)2 can be stated; it takes the following form

[formula]

and has been verified on the seven fractals investigated here. In this case, (ΔE)2 decreases by a factor by = bu + (df - 1) under a suitable change of length unit 1  →  b. A similar process could be applied in the study of Wolff cluster size or the successive change of total magnetic moments. One can show that [formula] and, therefore, γ  /  ν is upper bounded by (γ  /  ν + df - zMsf) / 2 where zMsf is the statistic-fluctuation dynamical exponent associated to the total magnetic moment. It implies zMsf  ≤  df  -  γ  /  ν = 2β  /  ν.

The method developed in this paper can be generalized to the study of some physical quantity whose mean value follows a power law with respect to L. For instance, since 〈|M|〉  ~  Lyh at Tc, one can verify, by constructing a homogeneous transformation for the probability density of |M| similar to Eq.([\ref=Scaling_prob_s]), that |M| decreases by a factor b(yh + df) / 2 under a suitable rescaling 1  →  b. All these results suggest that the scaling properties of some physical quantity at Tc, where the correlation length is divergent, comes originally from the underlying hierarchal structure of a fractal.

In summary, we have studied the scaling properties of the Wolff cluster surface energy in the framework of the Ising model in the case of seven different fractals dimensions. A new scaling relation for the absolute value of the surface energy |ΔE| of the Wolff's cluster has been established. We have shown that |ΔE| scales as b- yS|ΔE| under an increment of the length unit by the factor b, which remains invariant the underlying structure of the fractal. Finally, the surface exponent SW is proved to be upper bounded by ν- 1 - zEsf / 2.
