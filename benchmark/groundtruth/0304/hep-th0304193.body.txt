Introduction

It is known that there are four kinds of fundamental interactions in Nature, which are strong interactions, electromagnetic interactions, weak interactions and gravitational interactions. All these fundamental interactions can be described by gauge field theories, which can be regarded as the common nature of all these fundamental interactions. And we can unify different kinds of fundamental interactions in the framework of gauge theory. The first unification of fundamental interactions in human history is the unification of electric interactions and magnetic interactions, which is made by Maxwell in 1864. Now, we know that electromagnetic theory is a U(1) abelian gauge theory. In 1921, H.Weyl tried to unify electromagnetic interactions and gravitational interactions in a theory which has local scale invariance[\cite=1] [\cite=2]. Weyl's original attempt is not successful, however in his great attempt, he introduced one of the most important concept in modern physics: gauge transformation and gauge symmetry. After the foundation of quantum mechanics, V.Fock, H.Weyl and W.Pauli found that quantum electrodynamics is a U(1) gauge invariant theory[\cite=3] [\cite=4] [\cite=5].

In 1954, Yang and Mills proposed non-abelian gauge field theory[\cite=6]. Soon after, non-abelian gauge field theory is applied to elementary particle theory. In about 1967 and 1968, using the spontaneously symmetry breaking and Higgs mechanism[\cite=7] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10] [\cite=11] [\cite=12] [\cite=13] [\cite=14], S.Weinberg and A.Salam proposed the unified electroweak theory, which is a SU(2)  ×  U(1) gauge theory[\cite=15] [\cite=16] [\cite=17]. The unified electroweak theory is now widely called the standard model. The predictions of unified electroweak theory have been confirmed in a large number of experiments, and the intermediate gauge bosons W± and Z0 which are predicted by unified electroweak model are also found in experiments. However, in the traditional standard model, the gravitational interactions are not considered. From nineteen seventies, physicist begin studying Grand Unified theories which try to unify strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions in a simple group. At that time, SU(5) model[\cite=18] [\cite=19], SO(10) model[\cite=20] [\cite=21] [\cite=22], E6 model[\cite=23] [\cite=24] [\cite=25] and other models[\cite=26] [\cite=27] [\cite=28] are proposed. In all these attempts, gravitational interactions are not considred.

Gauge treatment of gravity was suggested immediately after the gauge theory birth itself[\cite=29] [\cite=30] [\cite=31]. In the traditional gauge treatment of gravity, Lorentz group is localized, and the gravitational field is not represented by gauge potential[\cite=32] [\cite=33] [\cite=34]. It is represented by metric field. The theory has beautiful mathematical forms, but up to now, its renormalizability is not proved. In other words, it is conventionally considered to be non-renormalizable. Recently, Wu proposed a new quantum gauge theory of gravity which is a renormalizable quantum gravity[\cite=35] [\cite=36]. Based on gauge principle, space-time translation group is selected to be the symmetry of gravitational interactions, which appears in a new form and is called gravitational gauge group. After localization of gravitational gauge group, the gravitational field appears as the corresponding gauge potential. After that work, the unified theory of electromagnetic interactions and gravitational interactions is discussed[\cite=37]. Then this unified theory is generalized to SU(N) non-abelian case and the the unification of SU(N) non-abelian gauge interactions and gravitational interactions, which will be called GSU(N) unification theory, is discussed[\cite=38]. GSU(N) unification theory is also a renormalizable quantum model[\cite=39]. Now, using the method propsed in leteratures [\cite=37] and [\cite=38], we will try to unify four different kinds of fundamental interactions in Nature in one theory. This unification is based on the symmetry of direct or semi-direct product group, which is the direct extension of the standard model to gravitational interactions. This unification theory is also perturbatively renormalzable.

Gravitational Gauge Field

First, for the sake of integrity, we give a simple introduction to gravitational gauge theory and introduce some notations which is used in this paper. Details on quantum gauge theory of gravity can be found in leteratures [\cite=35] and [\cite=36].

In gauge theory of gravity, the most fundamental quantity is gravitaional gauge field Cμ(x). which is the gauge potential corresponding to gravitational gauge symmetry. Gauge field Cμ(x) is a vector in the corresponding Lie algebra, which, for the sake of convenience, will be called gravitational Lie algrbra in this paper. So it can expanded as

[formula]

where Cαμ(x) is the component field and P̂α is the generator of gravitational gauge group. The gravitational gauge covariant derivative is given by

[formula]

where g is the gravitational coupling constant.

Matrix G is an important quantity in gauge theory of gravity, whose definition is

Lagrangian and Action

Now, we know that there are four kinds of fundamental interactions in Nature, which are strong interactions, electromagnetic interactions, weak interactions and gravitational interactions. In the traditional standard model, the first three fundamental interactions are considered. In this chapter, we will generalize the standard model to gravitational interactions. In other words, the new standard model is a theory that can describe any fundamental physical process which human kind has already known in Nature.

We know that the fundamental particles that we know are fundamental fermions (such as leptons and quarks), gauge bosons(such as photon, gluons, gravitons and intermediate gauge bosons W± and Z0), and possible Higgs bosons. Our goal is to construct a theory which can describe all possible fundamental interactions among all these elementary particles. We know that the symmetry of the traditional standard model is SU(3)c  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y. SU(3)c is the gauge symmetry for strong interactions, SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y is the symmetry for electroweak interactions. The gauge symmetry for gravitational interactions is gravitational gauge group. If we generalize the standard model to gravitational interactions, the symmetry group is

[formula]

This is the symmetry of generalized standard model.

Before we construct the lagrangian of the system, let's first define wave functions of various elementary particles. According to the Standard Model, leptons form left-hand doublets and right-hand singlets. Let's denote

[formula]

[formula]

Neutrinos have no right-hand singlets. The weak hypercharge for left-hand doublets ψ(i)L is - 1 and for right-hand singlet ψ(i)R is - 2. All leptons are SU(3)c singlet, so they carry no color charge. The charges of leptons are given by Gell-Mann-Nishijima rule,

[formula]

where Y is the hypercharge and TL3 is the weak isospin. In order to define the wave function for quarks, we have to introduce Kabayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix first, whose general form is,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and θi are generalized Cabibbo angles. The mixing between three different quarks d,s and b is given by

[formula]

Quarks also form left-hand doublets and right-hand singlets,

[formula]

[formula]

where index a is color index. It is known that left-hand doublets have weak isospin [formula] and weak hypercharge [formula], right-hand singlets have no weak isospin, q(j)aus have weak hypercharge [formula] and q(j)aθds have weak hypercharge [formula]. Charges of quarks are also given by Gell-Mann-Nishijima rule.

The symmetry of system is given by eq.([\ref=4.1]). We can see that there are four different symmetry group. For every kinds of symmetry group, there are corresponding gauge fields which transmit corresponding gauge interactions. For gauge bosons, gravitational gauge field is also denoted by Cαμ. The coupling constant of gravitational interactions is still denoted by g. The gluon field is denoted by Aμ,

[formula]

where λi are Gell-Mann matrix. Color index is denoted by indexes [formula], so

[formula]

The field strength of gluon field is Aμν

[formula]

where gc is the coupling constant for strong interactions. Aiμν is the component field strength of gluon field, whose explicit expression is

[formula]

where fijk is the structure constant of SU(3) group. Aμν is not SU(3) gauge covariant field strength. SU(3) gauge covariant field strength is defined by

Therefore, the system has gravitational gauge symmetry.

Now, as a whole, we discuss

Spontaneously Symmetry Breaking

It is known that, SU(3)c color symmetry and gravitational gauge symmetry are strict symmetry. SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y symmetry are not strict symmetry, which is broken to U(1)Q symmetry. Now, let's discuss spontaneously symmetry breaking of the system. The potential of Higgs field is

gauge symmetry. After spontaneously symmetry breaking, the system has

gauge symmetry. Four different kinds of fundamental interactions are unified in the same lagrangian. So, the lagrangian density L which is given by eq.([\ref=4.24]) and eq.([\ref=4.26]) can be used to calculate any fundamental interaction process in Nature.

Summary and Discussions

In this paper, we have studied unifications of four kinds of fundamental interactions in Nature, which is unified in the direct or semi-direct product group. This model is the direct extension of the standard model to gravitational interactions.

It is know that the real spirit of the traditional unification is to try to unify different kinds of fundamental interactions in a single simple Lie-group, where only one coupling constant is used in the unification. But now, we find that it is impossible to unify gravitational interactions with other fundamental interactions in a theory which has only one independent parameter for coupling constant. The reason is that, the generators of gravitational gauge group have mass dimension, while the generators of ordinary SU(N) group are dimensionless. If we use only one coupling constant in a unified theory, we will need another independent parameters to balance the difference of the dimensions of generators. It means that we really use two independent parameters for coupling constant, which is equivalent to the theory with two independent coupling constants. Therefore, any unification theory of gravity must need at least two independent parameters for coupling constant. In other words, it is impossible to unify four kinds of fundamental interactions in a simple group in which only one independent parameter for coupling constant is used.

Quantization of the unified theory of fundamental interactions can be performed in the path integral method. In order to keep the unitarity of the S-matrix, ghost fields for gravitational gauge symmetry, SU(2)L symmetry and SU(3)c color symmetry are needed[\cite=40]. We can obtain Feynmann rules for various interaction vertices and propagaters for matter fields, gauge fields and ghost fields. After obtain Feynmann rules, we can calculate Feynmann dagrams for various interaction processes and determine finite quantum modificaitons in the classical theory of gravity.

It is known that quantum gauge theory of gravity is a perturbatively renormalizable quantum theory. Detailed proof on its renormalizability can be found in literature [\cite=35] [\cite=36]. The foundations of the unified theory of fundamental interactions which is discussed in this paper is the GSU(N) unification theory which is discussed in literature [\cite=37] [\cite=38]. Because the theory has strict GSU(N) symmetry, it is believed that the theory is also renormalizable. Detailed study shows that the strict local GSU(N) symmetry gives out two sets of generalized BRST transformations which will give out two sets of generalized Ward-Takahashi identities. Using these two sets of generalized Ward-Takahashi identities, we can determine the general form of the divergent part of the generating functional of regular vertex. After the divergent part of the generating functional is cancelled by counterterm, the renormalized generating functional is just a scale transformation of the non-renormalized generating functional. Comparing the renormalized theory with the non-renormalized theory, we will find that the only effect of the renormalization is to redefine the fields, coupling constants and some other parameters of the original theory. Only a few new parameters are introduced in the renormalization, so the GSU(N) unification theory is indeed a renormalizable quantum theory[\cite=39]. Detailed proof on its renormalizability is quite complicated mathematically, which will be discussed in a separate paper. Unified theory of fundamental interactions is just an application of the GSU(N) unification theory to fundamental interactions in Nature. Because the GSU(N) unification theory is renormalizable and from the standard model, we know that the spontaneously symmetry breaking does not affect the renormalizability of the theory, the unified theory of fundamental interactions which is discussed in this paper is a renormalizable quantum theory. Detailed and strict proof on its renormalizability will be found in our future work[\cite=40]. This is the first renormalizable quantum model which contains four different kinds of fundamental interactions in Nature. In the future, we will use this model to study quantum effects of gravitational interactions and new effects which are originated from the non-Abelian nature of GSU(N) group and lead to direct coupling between gravitational gauge field and ordinary gauge fields(such as electromagnetic field, intermediate gauge field and gluon field).
