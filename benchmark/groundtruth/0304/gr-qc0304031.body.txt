Introduction

A major issue in the resurgence of de Sitter (dS) space physics motivated by inflation scenarii [\cite=daniel1] [\cite=daniel2], astronomical observation [\cite=perl], dS/CFT correspondence [\cite=antoniadis] [\cite=mazur] [\cite=bousso] [\cite=tolley], and the study of a simple maximally symmetric space with non vanishing curvature, concerns the status of a "preferred" vacuum state for the associated QFT. The absence of a global time-like Killing vector field in de Sitter space (non stationary) excludes the "natural" choice characterized by the spectrum of a Hamiltonian operator unlike the Minkowski case. The presence of a maximal symmetry group does not get rid of this problem: there exists a family of inequivalent vacua which are all invariant under the dS group [\cite=chernikov] [\cite=mottola] [\cite=allen1].

Nevertheless, thanks to this group, one can study the limit at vanishing curvature owning to the method of group contraction which allows to follow the unitary irreducible representations (hereafter UIR) in that limit. It has been shown [\cite=mini] that the representations of the de Sitter group associated to the massive scalar field, i.e. the principal series of SO(1,4), contract (in the zero curvature limit) toward the direct sum of two UIR's of the Poincaré group associated respectively to positive and negative frequencies massive scalar fields, namely:

[formula]

This result could appear as somewhat confusing since it suggests that the curvature is in some sense responsible for the emergence of negative frequency modes in QFT. This is all the more disturbing since a recent paper shows that these modes necessarily occur in the covariant quantization of the minimally coupled scalar field [\cite=gareta1]. Since on the level of two-point functions, the flat limit seems to work perfectly well, it has been argued that group representation contractions were not adapted for the study of QFT [\cite=brmo]. Attempts have been made in replacing SO(1,4) by the de Sitter "causal semi-group" which contracts toward the Poincaré causal semi-group [\cite=mizony]. In view of the decisive role played by group theory in ordinary QFT and in defining on de Sitter space objects as mass or spin, it is really frustrating that one cannot manage group representation in the flat limit process. In this paper we propose to amend this drawback.

The Euclidean vacuum has been studied before and singled out by analyticity requirements [\cite=brmo] [\cite=brgamo], flat space behavior or further reasons listed in [\cite=larsen]. Although the Euclidean vacuum seems to be favored, it remains sensible to use the whole vacua family; for instance as tools in order to investigate the effects of transplanckian physics [\cite=daniel1] [\cite=daniel2]. In this paper, we reconsider the flat limit through the modes. The flat limit for a mode is obtained by considering the latter on a domain which is small compared to the inverse of the curvature. This process can be applied of course at any point of spacetime with different results. The use of ambient space formalism allows to show in a very simple way that the Euclidean vacuum is the only vacuum for which the flat limit yields, in any point of spacetime, positive frequency modes. Furthermore the use of the de Sitter waves shows that the whole free QFT tends toward the flat theory when the curvature vanishes, including the de Sitter Fourier transform which becomes the ordinary Fourier transform in the limit. Some of us will show in future works that these de Sitter waves are also very well adapted to group representations and spinorial computation.

Moreover, our procedure will allow us to reconsider the significance of the result on group contractions quoted before. In this paper we argue that although Eq. ([\ref=contract]) can hold it does not represent the only possibility. Actually, we show that the principal series of SO(1,4) can contract toward the positive energy representation of the Poincaré group, result which is, as soon as we know, new.

The de Sitter waves and ambient space formalism are summarized in Sec. 2. The flat limit is investigated in Sec. 3. The problem of the contraction of group representations is tackled in Sec. 4. Sec. 5. is devoted to some concluding remarks.

The de sitter waves

The de Sitter space is conveniently seen as a hyperboloid embedded in a five-dimensional time oriented Minkowski space [formula]:

[formula]

where ηαβ  =  (1, - 1, - 1, - 1, - 1). The (pseudo-) sphere [formula] is obviously invariant under O(1,4). We only consider the connected component of the identity SOo(1,4), the so-called de Sitter group. We are in particular interested in the flat limit (i.e. H  →  0) of the massive scalar free quantum field and the behavior of the group representation in this limit.

The free massive scalar field on this spacetime is, in the Wigner sense, an elementary system whose associated unitary irreducible representation belongs to the principal series of representations of SOo(1,4). This UIR is characterized by the eigenvalue ν2 + 9 / 4 of the Casimir operator Q0 which is linked to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on [formula] through [formula] [\cite=dix]. The contraction of that UIR has already been studied in a group theoretical context [\cite=mini]. The result is usually written in the following way: the massive representations contract toward the direct sum of the positive energy and negative energy representations of the Poincaré group. We emphasize that this result has been achieved on a purely group theoretical level through an ad hoc process of contraction. Although it is from this point of view remarkable that the irreducible representation can contract toward a reducible representation, there is no uniqueness in this choice of contraction procedure. In the framework of QFT this result played a rather misleading role in order to understand field theory on de Sitter background from our Minkowskian point of view. Actually, we will see that the negative energy plane waves do not appear when the curvature vanishes as soon as the Euclidean vacuum has been chosen.

In [\cite=brmo] [\cite=brgamo], the authors use a set of global modes, the de Sitter waves, solutions of the de Sitter Klein-Gordon equation, which are the formal analogue of the plane waves in Minkowski spacetime. We will see that these modes reduce to the usual plane waves when the curvature tends to zero as far as their analyticity domain has been conveniently chosen.

Let C+    =  {ξ∈E5;  ξ2 = 0,  ξ0 > 0} be the null upper cone of [formula]. The multivalued functions defined on dS spacetime by:

[formula]

are solutions of the de Sitter Klein-Gordon equation [formula], where ζ is a positive gravitational coupling with the de Sitter background and

[formula]

corresponds to the principal series of UIR (massive case). The expression defined by Eq. ([formula]) is, as a function of ξ, homogeneous with degree s on C+ and thus is entirely determined by specifying its values on a well chosen three dimensional submanifold (the so-called orbital basis) γ of C+. These dS waves, as functions on de Sitter spacetime, are only locally defined because they are singular on specific lower dimensional subsets of [formula] and multivalued since [formula] can be negative. In order to get a singlevalued global definition, they have to be viewed as distributions which are boundary values of analytic continuations to suitable domains in the complexified de Sitter space [formula]:

[formula]

The minimal domains of analyticity which yield single-valued functions on de Sitter spacetime are the forward and backward tubes of [formula]: [formula], where T± = E5 - iV± and [formula] Details are given in [\cite=brmo].

When Z varies in T+ and ξ lies in the positive cone C+, the functions given in Eq. ([\ref=eq:mode]) are globally well defined since the imaginary part of (Z.ξ) is non positive. We define the de Sitter waves φξ(X) as the boundary value of the analytic continuation to the future tube of Eq. ([\ref=eq:mode]):

[formula]

where θ is the Heaviside function. The real valued constant cν is determined by imposing the Hadamard condition on the two-point function. This choice of modes corresponds to the Euclidean vacuum. In terms of de Sitter waves, the two-point function reads [\cite=brgamo]: where Z∈T+ and Z'∈T-. The measure dσγ(ξ) on the orbital basis γ is chosen to be m2 times the natural one induced from the [formula] Lebesgue measure. The calculation, similar to that of [\cite=brgamo] yields:

The flat limit of de sitter waves

Hereafter, we investigate the behavior of the mode φξ(X) under vanishing curvature. We consider a region around any point [formula] in which all the distances are small compared to H- 1. With this assumption, we will prove that

[formula]

In other words, these modes do not generate negative frequency modes in the flat limit, whatever the point around which the limit is computed.

Due to the homogeneity of the de Sitter space under the de Sitter group action, one can choose a system of coordinates such that [formula] and [formula]. In the neighborhood of this point, for H  →  0, the de Sitter spacetime meets its tangent plane (the four dimensional Minkowski spacetime), and the coordinates X of this neighborhood read:

[formula]

For [formula], exp ( - iπs)  →  0 and one obtains:

[formula]

The Heaviside function yields ξ4 < 0 since HX  ·  ξ≃  -  ξ4 and finally, for small H:

[formula]

This limit exists only for |ξ4| = 1. As a consequence, we use the orbital basis [formula], where C1,C2 are defined by:

[formula]

with [formula]. Note that the induced measure on γ is [formula] and therefore [formula]. We finally obtain Eqs. ([formula]) according to whether ξ belongs to C1 or C2 i.e., [formula] positive or negative.

Thus, due to the analyticity condition at the origin of the exp ( - iπs) term, the negative energy modes are (exponentially) suppressed whereas the positive energy modes give the Minkowskian on-shell modes corresponding to a particle of mass m.

We insist on the fact that the result leads to positive frequency plane waves whatever the point [formula] we choose. This choice of modes, which corresponds to the Euclidean vacuum, is the only one having this property. Any Bogoliubov transformation on these modes leads to the appearance of conjugate modes φ*ξ whose flat limit at some point [formula] is a negative frequency mode as soon as B has been chosen in such a way that [formula].

As a consequence, any vacuum different from the Euclidean vacuum would lead to physically unacceptable Minkowskian QFT. The Euclidean vacuum has therefore to be preferred with respect to the flat limit criterion.

The de Sitter waves allow to define a de Sitter Fourier transform which becomes the ordinary Fourier transform in the flat limit. In fact, one can realize the de Sitter one particle sector [formula] as distributions on spacetime through this de Sitter Fourier transform: any [formula] can be written as:

[formula]

see [\cite=brmo] for details. Let [formula] be a point of de Sitter spacetime in the neighborhood of which we will proceed to the flat limit. The space [formula] can then be decomposed into [formula] using the decomposition of the orbital basis:

[formula]

In the limit of null curvature, the second integral of the above expression vanishes and only the positive frequency remains:

[formula]

As a consequence, the ordinary Fourier transform is the flat limit of the de Sitter Fourier transform. Once again, one can see the significance of de Sitter waves which play in de Sitter space the role of plane waves in Minkowski space, including a good behavior with respect to the de Sitter group: one can see easily using [formula] that each space [formula] is invariant under the subgroup generated by the Mab with [formula] (see appendix). This subgroup, isomorphic to SOo(1,3), is the stabilizer of [formula].

Group contraction

The Minkowski spacetime is the flat limit of the de Sitter spacetime with respect to all the objects of QFT. In order to emphasize this fact and clarify the link between our approach and that of [\cite=mini] we will present the concept of contractions in a slightly different manner from the usual presentation.

Let us consider a family of representations [formula] of a group G into some spaces [formula] and a representation U of a group G' into a space H. One wants to give a precise meaning to the assertion [formula] for H  →  0 (one says that the representations [formula] contract toward U).

First, we must have a bijection [formula] (which is not an homomorphism) conveying the "similarity" between the two groups. Second we need a space, equipped with a topology, in which all the representations are written. This is obtained by writing an injective map [formula] from [formula] to E  ⊃  H where E is a topological space containing H in such a way that for any [formula] the limit [formula] exists in E and belongs to H.

We say that the representations [formula] contract toward U if:

[formula]

where g' is the element of G' identified with g∈G by means of i.

Let us now return to de Sitter context. For x in Minkowski space we define X in de Sitter space through Eq. ([\ref=eq:_coord]). We then can define [formula]: for the de Sitter waves φξ we define [formula] as a function on Minkowski spacetime through:

[formula]

This definition extends linearly to [formula] through Eq. ([\ref=eq:_bo]). Then in view of Eq. ([\ref=eq:lim]) we have, at least in a weak sense, for any ψ in [formula]:

[formula]

where f is a positive frequency wave packet on Minkowski spacetime.

We now turn to the representations. The de Sitter and Poincaré groups are identified as explained in the appendix. Consider:

[formula]

The representation of the de Sitter group is defined by:

[formula]

where [formula] is the [formula] matrix defined by

[formula]

and the representation of the Poincaré group is defined by:

[formula]

One can easily see that for ξ  ∈C1:

[formula]

Then Eq. ([\ref=eq:_cont]) follows and the principal series of representations of the de Sitter group contract toward the positive energy representation of the Poincaré group. Once again, no negative energy can appear in this process. Nevertheless this is not in contradiction with [\cite=mini] for which this series can contract toward another representation. In fact, in our context, the result of [\cite=mini] can be recovered by modifying [formula] in the following way. One can define [formula] by [formula] on [formula] and [formula] on [formula]. With this operator, one obtains the result of [\cite=mini] because the artificial exponential term cancels the natural one which is present in the definition of φξ thanks to the property of analyticity.

Conclusions

Recently, several papers summarized the theory of irreducible unitary representations of the de Sitter group.

A result, commonly quoted in these summaries, suggests that the appearance of negative energies for a Minkowskian observer is an unavoidable consequence of group theory. For this reason some authors claimed that the contraction procedure of group representations was not suitable in order to investigate the flat limit of dS-QFT.

We have shown that this is inexact. We also conclude that the Euclidean vacuum as to be preferred as far as one wishes to recover ordinary QFT in the flat limit.

To that end we used the formalism of de Sitter waves which turned out to be a very convenient tool, possibly as useful in de Sitter space as the plane waves in Minkowski space.

Appendix: Identification of de Sitter and Poincaré groups

We begin with Lie algebras. Let Δa,b be the 5  ×  5 matrices whose entries anm are defined by anm  =  δnaδmb.

The following matrices are a basis of the Lie algebra so(1,4) of the Lie group SOo(1,4).

[formula]

The following matrices are a basis of the Lie algebra p(1,3) of the Poincaré group.

[formula]

The identification between the two Lie algebras is obtained through :

[formula]

The identification between the groups follows, using the exponential application.
