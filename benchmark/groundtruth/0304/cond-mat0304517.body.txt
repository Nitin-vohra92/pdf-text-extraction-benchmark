Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of a Lowest Landau Level Electron Gas on a Thin Cylinder

We investigate the ground state properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in the lowest Landau level using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group. The electron gas is confined to a cylinder with a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the surface. For a thin cylinder, the ground state is for generic filling factors a charge density wave state, however, at ν = 1 / 2 a homogeneous and apparently gapless ground state is found and particle and hole excitations are studied.

Of the many different methods used for studying strongly correlated systems the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) invented by White [\cite=White] [\cite=White2] in 1992 is one of the most successful. The method, which is an extension of Wilson's Renormalization Group (RG) [\cite=Wilson], provides a reliable method for analyzing one-dimensional quantum systems that are far out of reach with exact diagonalization methods. For higher dimensional systems the DMRG is much less useful.

The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field becomes effectively one-dimensional when the field is strong enough for the motion to be restricted to the lowest Landau level (LLL). In this limit the DMRG may become an efficient tool. The finite size DMRG has recently been applied to this system for an electron gas confined to a torus [\cite=Shibata]. The results are in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization studies, extending the latter from around 15 to 25 particles. In this article, we apply the infinite size version of the DMRG to the lowest Landau level problem when the electron gas is confined to a cylinder. This makes it possible to study the limit where the number of particles N tends to infinity. On the other hand, the range of the interaction limits us to study thin cylinders.

For generic quantum Hall (QH) filling fractions such as ν = 1 / 3 we find charge density wave ground states where, for ν = 1 / 3, approximately every third site is occupied by an electron. This result is in agreement with previous results on smaller systems [\cite=Haldane] where the 1 / 3 state is shown to be a charge density wave on a thin cylinder. However, for the half-filled Landau level we find a non-trivial result--a homogeneous ground state with excitations that appear to be gapless. (For even smaller L, this state also gives way to a crystalline state.)

We consider a charged particle moving in two dimensions in a perpendicular magnetic field B. By solving the Schr�dinger equation in Landau gauge, [formula], we map the two-dimensional system onto a one-dimensional system. The eigenfunctions in the lowest Landau level are [formula], where L is the circumference of the cylinder, [formula] is the magnetic length and k is the momentum in the y-direction. Imposing periodic boundary conditions in the y-direction gives [formula] and the density of states in the LLL is [formula]. The eigenfunction with y-momentum k is centered at [formula]. This provides a mapping of the LLL onto a one-dimensional problem which can be thought of as a spin chain where each site k has two states--either the site is occupied by an electron or it is empty.

Following Trugman and Kivelson [\cite=Kivelson], we introduce a repulsive short range potential between the particles which can be expanded as

[formula]

where b is the range of the interaction. Taking the limit of short range, b  →  0, the expression ([\ref=generalint]) reduces to [formula] since [formula] for any antisymmetric state. The form of this interaction can be motivated by the fact that the physics of quantum Hall systems does not change qualitatively if the interaction is made more local than the more realistic Coulomb interaction.

From the interaction and the single particle states in the LLL we find a second quantized form of the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is then analyzed and the low energy states are approximated by use of the DMRG method. The Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where n, k and l denote all possible momentum states and we use units where [formula] and set J = 1. The DMRG algorithm becomes inefficient when the interaction extends over too many sites. The most local interaction in position space leads to the momentum space interaction in ([\ref=AH]). We introduce a cut-off d in the range of the interaction--d is the number of sites the interaction extends over. Since the distance between the sites is [formula] it follows that we are restricted to small circumferences L in order for the cut-off not to modify the shape of the interaction. Thus we are studying the QH system on a thin cylinder. Note, however, that alternatively we may view this as a large two-dimensional system with an interaction that extends only a distance [formula] in the x-direction. Albeit being an unphysical interaction this is a mathematically well-defined limit where the system can be studied. We perform calculations for d  ≤  6. From the form of the interaction in (2) it follows that this restricts L to at most about 10 magnetic lengths. The results presented below are for [formula]--this corresponds to the distance between the sites being [formula].

As it stands, the Hamiltonian has a trivial ground state since the interaction is repulsive - the energy is minimal (and equal to zero) when there are no particles present. However, in a real physical system the density of electrons, ne, is finite--the negative charge of the electron gas is compensated for by a positive background charge that makes the whole system neutral. Thus we want to analyze the case when the filling fraction [formula] is fixed and nonzero. In order to target a state with a specific filling fraction, ν, we add a term to the Hamiltonian that favours the chosen density: [formula]. (All energies presented below are of course for γ = 0.)

The Hamiltonian commutes with [formula], hence the total number of particles is a conserved quantum number. As a consequence, for given N only the filling fractions [formula] can be obtained. This makes it in general necessary to keep states with different number of particles when studying a certain state in the N  →    ∞   limit.

For generic filling fractions we find charge density wave ground states in agreement with earlier work [\cite=Haldane] [\cite=Tao]. As an example, we show in Fig. [\ref=var033] results for ν = 1 / 3. The ground state is, to a good approximation, obtained by putting an electron on every third site. Thus the range of the interaction is so short that this simple crystal has lower energy than, e.g., a homogeneous state [\cite=Laughlin].

However, for the half-filled Landau level we find a very different and much more interesting result--a homogenous ground state [\cite=emil]. In Fig. [\ref=qh1] we present some of our results for the ν = 1 / 2 state. The obtained ground state has an almost perfectly uniform density throughout the system. The mean density is 1 / 2 up to the precision of at least 16 digits--this precision is a consequence of Ne being a conserved quantum number. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the single site density 〈  c†ici  〉 is as small as 10- 12 for large systems. We also note that the energy of the homogeneous state is very low compared to the crystalline states obtained when d  ≤  2. Thus the obtained state has used the off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian to reduce the energy in a very efficient way. The results quoted are independent of the number of states, m, that are kept in each iteration.

The density 〈  c†ici  〉 given above, is really the linear density along the cylinder, i.e. the full density integrated around the cylinder. The density operator is

[formula]

However, we find that [formula] to a very high precision. Hence the density is constant on the cylinder.

For d  ≤  2, the ν = 1 / 2 ground state is crystalline. At d = 1 every other site is occupied and at d = 2 two occupied sites alternate with two empty--these are exact ground states. At ν = 1 / 4 the ground state is a crystal for d  ≤  6.

We have made a preliminary investigation of charged excitations at ν = 1 / 2 by targeting states with density ν = 1 / 2  ±  1 / N for N sites. We find a particle excitation with charge - |e| relative to the ground state and energy Ep = 2.0 and a hole with charge |e| and energy Eh =  - 1.8 (J = 1, d = 4 and we keep m = 4 states in total). This gives an energy gap Δ = Ep + Eh = 0.2 to creating a separated particle-hole pair. We take the smallness of Δ compared to Ep,Eh to indicate that Δ approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit and that the system is gapless. To test this we should consider the limit N  →    ∞   and m  →    ∞  . For the particle this is straightforward, however, for the hole the calculations are unstable when m is increased. Increasing N only moderately (to avoid the instability) we find that Δ decreases with increasing m, supporting the conclusion that Δ  →  0. We believe the instability is due to a degeneracy in the energy of the hole state. We find that the hole forms at the center of the system--there should then be degenerate states where the hole is translated to other positions. That no instability is seen for the particle indicates that it forms at the edge of the system. Fig. [\ref=2] shows the density profile of the hole. The charge integrated over the area, with length [formula], shown in the figure is 0.98|e| relative to the ground state in Fig. [\ref=qh1].

A further indication of the existence of gapless excitations is shown in Fig. [\ref=new]. It shows the increase in total energy of the ν = 1 / 2 ground state per iteration up to large systems. In these calculations, states at density ν = 1 / 2 and ν = 1 / 2 + 1 / N are kept. Initially, a smooth convergence to the homogeneous ν = 1 / 2 ground state is observed--this is reflected in the figure in that the same amount of energy is added at each step. In each iteration two sites and one electron are added at the center of the superblock, thus keeping the average density fixed at ν = 1 / 2. Then suddenly at iteration 470 a slightly smaller energy is added. A new ground state is formed as a superposition of the homogeneous ν = 1 / 2 ground state in the previous iteration (adding two sites and one electron to this) and the state containing one particle excitation (adding two sites and no particle to this). The energy of this state is actually lower than the energy of the homogeneous state since the added energy in the last iteration decreased. We take this as indicating that the particle-hole excitation is gapless.

In addition to the above studies of excitations, where we always target only the lowest energy state, we have also targeted the two or three lowest states. We then find that these states become degenerate as N and m  →    ∞   thus lending further support to the gaplessness of the ground state.

To conclude, for a thin cylinder we find a homogeneous, presumably gapless, ground state for the half-filled lowest Landau level--at all other filling fractions that we have investigated, including ν = 1 / 4, we find charge density wave states. It is of course tempting to identify the obtained ground state as the Rezayi-Read state [\cite=Rezayi], that is known from comparison to exact diagonalization studies to describe the ν = 1 / 2 state on the sphere very well. It remains to compare our state to the Rezayi-Read state. It is computationally nontrivial to compare large systems whereas small systems suffer from large edge effects, presumably making a comparison meaningless. A natural solution to this would be to employ the finite size DMRG method, possibly on the torus. An interesting questions is why there is a homogeneous state on thin cylinders only, as it seems, at ν  =  1 / 2. If this state is indeed the Rezayi-Read state, does our results shed any further light on the ν  =  1 / 2 quantum Hall state? A study of our ν  =  1 / 2 ground state indicates that it can be understood in terms of free fermions [\cite=ejbak].
