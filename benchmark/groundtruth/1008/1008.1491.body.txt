Constructing a supersymmetric generalization of the Gross-Neveu model

Introduction

In this paper I want to generalize the Gross-Neveu model to a supersymmetric theory. The questions I try to answer are: is there such a theory? And if yes, how does it compare to the standard Gross-Neveu model?

The Gross-Neveu-Model[\cite=GN] is a renormalizable relativistic field theory in 1+1 dimensions that has a four-fermion interaction ("ψ4 theory"), shows asymptotic freedom and is analytically soluble in the 't Hooft limit (N  →    ∞   while keeping Ng2 constant with N the number of flavours and g2 the coupling constant of the ψ4 interaction) even at finite temperature and density ([\cite=Schon:2000qy] provides an overview).

Supersymmetry (SUSY), the transformation of fermions into bosonic partners ([formula]) and vice versa ([formula]), is in 3+1 dimensions a candidate for physics beyond the standard model. Even (softly) broken it would solve the hierarchy problem in the Higgs sector (why do bare mass and quantum corrections compensate to a physical mass several orders of magnitude smaller?) and provide a possible dark matter particle. While in 3+1 dimensions supersymmetric ψ4 theories have been looked at (e.g. SNJL in [\cite=BuLove]), supersymmetric theories in 1+1 dimensions in general concentrate on interactions terms of the form ψV(Φ) + V2(Φ). A thorough introduction into this field is given by [\cite=Aitchison] while [\cite=Wipf] provides additional information on techniques for low dimensions and the use of Majorana spinors.

This paper follows my diploma thesis([\cite=Fitzner]). The first is dedicated to the formulation of general supersymmetric theories in 1+1 dimensions. Instead of using the elegant but very formal superfield ansatz I will build the theory from the free theory and check all classes of interaction terms for supersymmetric invariance by hand. In the second part I will select the most Gross-Neveu like theories and examine their vaccuum in the 't Hooft limit.

Building the supersymmetric theory

Basics and free theory

The theory is formulated in the usual way with Majorana spinors and real scalar fields. For the Dirac matrices the following Majorana representation is used In this representation for Majorana spinors and their bilinears the following relations hold true

The Lagrangian of the free theorie with a scalar field Φ, a Majorana field ψ and an auxiliary scalar field F, that is needed to match bosonic and fermionic off-shell degrees of freedom and can be eliminated via the Euler-Lagrange equation, reads and is invariant under the following SUSY transformations where the parameter ξ is a constant Majorana spinor. These transformations are determined by demanding linearity in parameter and fields, correct Lorentz transformations and correct mass dimensions. Introducing flavours, necessery to obtain ψ4 interactions and labelled by [formula], yields

Interaction terms

To obtain a theory with interactions I collect all possible combinations of the fields that are Lorentz scalar and invariant under O(N) flavour transformations and sort them by mass dimension. Then I try to find a set of coefficients that yields a SUSY invariant Lagrangian density.

O(M) interaction terms

The possible field combinations with mass dimension M1 (and consequently interaction terms with a coupling of dimension M1) are The factor (Φ)2l: = (ΦaΦa)l stems from the fact that every term can be multiplied by arbitary powers of ΦaΦa without changing mass dimension or behaviour under Lorentz and flavour transformations. Calculating the SUSY transformations and using the Fierz identity to simplify some of the terms, I obtain Calculating the interaction Lagrangian density for a fixed number of fields (since supersymmetry does not change the total number of fields) and collecting the same combinations of fields and derivatives yields The first three terms can be combined to a total derivative for [formula], βb = lcβc and la = lb + 1 = lc. The last three terms vanish with the same relations of βa,βb,βc. The complete Lagrangian density of interaction terms of mass dimension M1 can be written as Combining the free theory with an interaction Lagrangian given by W1 =  - m results, after eliminating the auxiliary field, in the Lagrangian of free massive scalar and Majorana fields with mass m.

O(M2) interaction terms

All possible interaction terms with massless coupling (and field combinations with dimension M2) are Using the same procedure as in the M1 case (resulting in 29 equations for the relations of 12 coefficients instead of 4 for 3, full calculation in [\cite=Fitzner]) I obtain The case [formula] reproduces the free theory, [formula] yields the most simple supersymmetric theory with ψ4 interaction.

Examining the theory in the 't Hooft limit

To obtain the 't Hooft limit I first eliminate the auxiliary field F, then take the usual Euler-Lagrange equations for ψ and Φ, replace all flavour singlets by their vacuum expectation values and use the fact that these vanish for field combinations that are not Lorentz scalar. The remaining expectation values are

Massive model

The massive model is given by choosing W1 =  - m0 and [formula]. The terms containing Fa can be replaced via the Euler-Lagrange equation by Only the last term will contribute in the 't Hooft limit. For ψ and Φ the Euler-Lagrange equations in the 't Hooft limit read where Λ is a UV cutoff ≫  MΦ,Mψ. Solving these conditions in general is difficult because MΦ and Mψ have an additional logarithmic relation (given by [formula]), leading to a transcendental equation for [formula] that also contains the bare coupling Ng2. The problematic term vanishes in the supersymmetric ansatz [formula] and consequently ρ0 =  - 2Mσ0. Using this ansatz in the equation for Mψ yields The gap equation [\ref=eq:gapm] is, save for a factor 2 in the coupling, identical to the one of the massive Gross-Neveu model (compare [\cite=Schon:2000qy]).

Massless model

The Lagrangian density of the massless model is given by W1 = 0 and [formula], the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived similarily to the massive case and read in the 't Hooft limit There is no dynamical generation of a physical mass in the case of preserved supersymmetry. The only other selfconsistent solution where both masses are independent of the cutoff is Mψ = 0, [formula]. This case provides a gap equation similiar to the Gross-Neveu model but the supersymmetric case is energetically favoured ([formula] against εSUSY = 0). In both cases the scalar density of the fermions is ρ0 = 0.

Conclusions

There is a whole class of renormalizable supersymmetric invariant field theories in 1+1 dimensions with a O(N) flavour symmetry that can be considered as generalizations of the Gross-Neveu model. Examining the vacua in the 't Hooft limit for the most simple of theses generalizations yields the following results: In the massive case there is a solution that shows the same behaviour as the respective Gross-Neveu model: The effective theory is that of N free scalar and Majorana fields with physical mass M where the relation of coupling Ng2, UV cutoff Λ, bare mass m0 and M is given by the gap equation [formula]. In the massless case the behaviour differs from the original Gross-Neveu model: No physical mass is dynamically generated in the supersymmetric case. This reproduces the result of Buchmüller and Love[\cite=BuLove] for the NJL model in 3+1 dimensions: the supersymmetry protects the (discrete) chiral symmetry of the original Lagrangian density.
