Introduction

A family of sets is called an (r,w)-cover-free family if no intersection of r sets of the family are covered by a union of any other w sets of the family. Cover-free family was first introduced by Kautz and Singleton [\cite=first] to investigate the properties of the non-random binary superimposed codes. In 1985, Erdös, Frankl, and Füredi [\cite=erdos] studied this concept as a generalization of Sperner system. In 1988, Mitchell and Piper [\cite=kps] defined the concept of key distribution pattern which is in fact a generalized type of cover-free family. Others have used this concept in cryptography, for example, group key predistribution, frameproof codes, broad cast anti-jamming, and so on, see [\cite=colborn]. Cover-free family has been studied extensively throughout the literature due to both its interesting structure and the central role it plays in several respects, see [\cite=blackburn] [\cite=engel] [\cite=erdos] [\cite=first] [\cite=cff2] [\cite=wei].

In this paper, we discuss aspects relevant to cover-free families. In Section 1, we set up notation and terminology. Section 2 is devoted to study the connection between cover-free families and biclique cover. In Section 3, we presents several new lower bounds for N((r,w;d),t). Finally, Section 4 concerns the fractional version of biclique cover and we determine the exact value of N((r,w;d),t) for some values of d. Finally, we show that if there exists a Hadamard matrix of order 4d, then N((1,1;d),4d - 1) = 4d - 1.

Throughout this paper, we only consider finite simple graphs. For a graph G, let V(G) and E(G) denote its vertex and edge sets, respectively. By a biclique we mean a bipartite graph with vertex set (X,Y) such that every vertex in X is adjacent to every vertex in Y. Note that every empty graph is a biclique. A biclique cover of a graph G is a collection of bicliques of G such that each edge of G is in at least one of the bicliques. The number of bicliques in a minimum biclique cover of G is called the biclique covering number of G and denoted by bc(G). This measure of graphs is studied in the literature [\cite=bc3] [\cite=bc1] [\cite=bc2].

In this paper, we also need a generalization of biclique cover as follows. As usual, we denote by

a= { .

Biclique Cover

In this section, we show that the existence of a cover-free family can result from the existence of biclique cover of bi-intersection graph and vice versa. Our viewpoint sheds some new light on cover-free family. Using this observation, we introduce several new bounds.

Let r, w, and t be positive integers, where t  ≥  r + w. It holds that

[formula]

By the same argument we obtain the following corollary.

Let r, w, d, and t be positive integers, where t  ≥  r + w. It holds that

[formula]

A weakly separating system on

[formula]

such that for every i,j∈[t] with i  ≠  j there is a k with either i∈Xk and j∈Yk or i∈Yk and j∈Xk. Similarly, a strongly separating system on

[formula]

such that for every ordered pair (i,j) with 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  t and i  ≠  j, there is a k∈[n] with i∈Xk and j∈Yk. The study of separating systems was started by Rényi [\cite=ss] in 1961. Other researchers have studied the properties of separating system in the literature, see [\cite=bllobas1] [\cite=bollobas2] [\cite=spencer] [\cite=css]. One can construct a (1,1) - CFF(n,t) from a strongly separating system on

[formula]

. Also, if the family [formula] is a biclique cover of Kt, where Gi has as its vertex set (Xi,Yi), then [formula] is a weakly separating system. So if we denote by s(t), the size of minimum weakly separating system, then we have s(t) = bc(Kt). Also, in [\cite=bc1], it was proved that R(t)  =  bc(K-t,t), where K-t,t is the complete bipartite graph Kt,t with a perfect matching removed. The exact value of R(t) was determined by Spencer [\cite=spencer].

Theorem [\ref=sss] implies

[formula]

It is simple to see that bc(G)  ≥  m(G), where m(G) is the maximum size of induced matchings of G. Let F  =  {(Ai,Bi)}hi = 1 be a family of pairs of subsets of an arbitrary set. The family F is called an (r,w)-system if for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  h, |Ai| = r, |Bi| = w, [formula], and for all distinct i,j with 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  h, [formula]. Bollobás [\cite=bollobas3] proved that the maximum size of an (r,w)-system is equal to [formula]. Obviously, m(It(r,w)) is the maximum size of an (r,w)-system, so [formula]. A covering of a graph G is a subset K of V(G) such that every edge of G has at least one end in K. The number of vertices in a minimum covering of G is called the covering number of G and denoted by β(G). It is not difficult to see that the biclique covering number of a graph G without C4 as a subgraph is equal to the covering number of G. So we have the following corollary.

For any positive integers r, w, and t, where t = r + w + 1 or t = r + w, we have

[formula]

We should mention that it is known [\cite=engel] that [formula] whenever [formula]. As an interesting application of cover-free family, one can consider key predistribution scheme (KPS). The specification structure of a KPS is the family of all disjoint pairs (P,F) of subsets of the set of users U such that every user in P must be able to compute a common key of P that will remain unknown to the coalition F. The above corollary gives the exact value of the minimum number of the keys in a KPS, constructed by a cover-free family, with r + w + 1 users.

Bounds

In this section, we introduce several bounds for N((r,w;d),t). Engel [\cite=engel], using the fractional matching and fractional cover of ordered interval hypergraph, obtained the following bounds Here is the best known lower bound for N((r,1),t). Several proofs have been presented for the preceding theorem. In [\cite=rcff1] [\cite=rcff2] [\cite=rcff3], it was shown that c is approximately [formula], [formula], and [formula], respectively.

Stinson, Wei, and Zhu [\cite=cff2], using Lemma [\ref=stinlem] and Theorem [\ref=rcff], improved the bounds of Engel in some cases and obtained the following bounds.

In [\cite=wei2], it was shown [formula]. Here we introduce some new lower bounds for N((r,w;d),t) which improve Theorem [\ref=engel] and also we present a lower bound (Theorem [\ref=estimate]) which can be considered as an improvement of Theorems [\ref=stinthm] and [\ref=stinthm2] whenever w is sufficiently small relative to r. We first prove the following preliminary lemma which will be needed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm].

Let G be a graph and [formula] be some pairwise vertex disjoint subgraphs of G. Also, assume that for every four cycle C4 of G and 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  k, we have [formula] or [formula]. Then

[formula]

Before embarking on the proof of the next theorem, we need the following definition. The family [formula] is called a weakly cross-intersecting set-pairs (resp. cross-intersecting set-pairs) of size g on a ground set of cardinality h whenever all Ai's and Bi's are subsets of an h-set and for every i, where 1  ≤  i  ≤  g, Ai and Bi are disjoint subsets, and furthermore, for every i  ≠  j, [formula] (resp. [formula] and [formula]). This concept is a variant of the generalization of (r,w)- weakly cross-intersecting set-pairs which was introduced first by Tuza [\cite=tuza]. The weakly cross-intersecting set-pairs [formula] is called an (r,w)-weakly cross-intersecting set-pairs whenever for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  g, |Ai| = r and |Bi| = w.

Hereafter, we adopt the convention that N((r,0;d),t) = N((0,w;d),t) = 1.

Suppose that g,h,r,w, and t are positive integers. Also, let [formula] be a weakly cross-intersecting set-pairs on a ground set of size h such that for any 1  ≤  i  ≤  g, |Ai|  ≤  r and |Bi|  ≤  w. If t  ≥   max {h,r + w}, then

[formula]

Here, we mention some consequences of the above theorem. Let M be an s-subset of

[formula]

F={(A, B)   :    A ⊆ M,  |A|=i, B=M A},

[formula]

E={(A, B)   :    A ⊆ M,  |A|=j, B=M A}.

[formula]

1.134 ≤ T((1,2);n) ≤ 1.25.

[formula]

N((r,w),t)≥N((2,1);t-r-w+3)+r+w-3 r+r+w-3 r-3.

[formula]

N((r,w;d),t) ≥ g(i,j) N((r-i,w-j;d),t-i-j).

[formula]

N((r,w),t) ≥ (2-o(1)) r+w-2 r-1R(t-r-w+2).

[formula]

N((r,r),t) ≥ (2-) 2r-2 r-1R(t-2r+2).

[formula]

N((r,w),t) ≥ cr+w w+1+r+w-1 w+1+ 3 r+w-4 w-2 log r log (t-w+1),

[formula]

Fractional Biclique Cover

The next result concerns the fractional version of biclique cover. If R is the set of all bicliques of a graph G, then each biclique cover of G can be described by a function φ:R  →  {0,1} such that φ(Gi) = 1 if and only if Gi belongs to the cover. Hence, bc(G) is the minimum of [formula] over all function φ:R  →  {0,1} such that for any edge e of G we have

[formula]

The fractional biclique covering number bc*(G) is the minimum of [formula] over all functions φ:R  →  [0,1] satisfying ([\ref=fraction]). Fractional graph theory is the modification of integer-valued graph parameters to take its value on non-integer values. For more on fractional graph theory and other fractional graph parameters, see [\cite=fractional]. In the fractional cover, using linear programming, it is proved that

[formula]

Also, we have the following theorem. Easily, one can see that

[formula]

Also, we have [formula], and It(r,w) is an edge-transitive graph. Therefore, in view of Theorem [\ref=frac], we have

[formula].

By a straightforward calculation, one can see that

[formula]

Lovász [\cite=lovasz] proved that for any graph G with maximum degree Δ(G)

[formula]

The maximum degree of the graph It(r,w) is equal to

[formula]

So we have the following corollary.

For any positive integers r, w, and t, where t  ≥  r + w, we have

[formula]

In [\cite=engel], Engel proved that

[formula]

Hence, we have

[formula]

where c is a constant. In the next theorem, we specify the exact value of N((r,w;d),t) for some special value of d. In the proof of the next theorem, by St we mean the permutation group of the set

[formula]

N((r,w;dd),t)=d (t!).

[formula]

N((r,w;c(r+1)!w!), r+w+1)=c(r+w+1)!.
