Early Spectroscopy of the 2010 Outburst of U Scorpii

Introduction

U Sco is a recurrent nova (RN) whose outburst occurs every 8-12 years. The recurrence time of U Sco is the shortest among all known RNe. U Sco is also known as a very fast nova defined by t2 < 10 d, where t2 is an elapsed time when the object faded by 2 mag from the outburst maximum [\citep=Payne-Gaposchkin1958]. Because of the rapid evolution, the earliest phase ([formula] d) of the outburst of U Sco is still poorly known in spite of its relatively short recurrence period.

[\citet=Schaefer1995] performed photometry of U Sco in its quiescent phase and found that it is an eclipsing binary having an orbital period of 1.23 d. The eclipse was also observed in the outburst in 1999 [\citep=Matusmoto2003]. [\citet=Hachisu2000] successfully reproduced the light curve including the eclipse, using their theoretical model with a very massive white dwarf (WD) close to the Chandrasekhar limit. Hence, U Sco is suggested to be a system in the final stage of binaries evolving to Type Ia supernovae [\citep=Hachisu1999] [\citep=Hachisu2008].

Thanks to the network for circulating the discovery reports and observations of transient objects (see [\cite=Kato2004] for review), observations just after the outburst maximum of U Sco were first performed in 1999 [\citep=Munari1999] [\citep=Anupama2000] [\citep=Iijima2002]. [\citet=Munari1999] and [\citet=Iijima2002] reported that the Balmer emission lines had triple peaks where the red peak is stronger than the blue and central ones at tp≃ + 0.65 d, where tp is the elapsed time from the peak of the outburst. The width of the emission lines gradually decreased with time. [\citet=Anupama2000] took an earlier spectrum at tp =  + 0.45 d, in which the red peak of Hα was weaker than the central one. These observations imply that a rapid change in the line profile would have occurred only within a few hours after the maximum brightness. This could be attributed to a temporal change in the structure of the earliest wind. A time-series spectroscopy in the earliest phase is required to probe the nature of the U Sco outburst.

We successfully obtained spectroscopic and photometric data of U Sco in the earliest phase just after the outburst discovery in 2010. In this Letter, we present the results of the spectroscopic observations in an early stage of the outburst. The results of photometric and late-time spectroscopic observations will be published in a forthcoming paper.

Observations and Reduction

The tenth outburst of U Sco was independently discovered at V = 8.05 on 2010 Jan 28.4385 UT by S. Dvorak and at visual magnitude of 8.8 by B. G. Harris [\citep=Schaefer2010a]. In this Letter, we use the epoch , td, which is the time since the discovery date by S. Dvorak. . We started spectroscopic observations of the outburst just after the discovery.

We performed spectroscopic observations of U Sco on 8 nights from 2010 Jan 28.86 to Feb 19.86 using HOWPol (Hiroshima One-shot Wide-field Polarimeter ; [\cite=Kawabata2008]) installed to the 1.5-m Kanata telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Astronomical Observatory (HHAO). The wavelength coverage was 4200-9000 Å and the spectral resolution was R = λ  /  Δλ  ~  400 at 6000 Å. On the first night, we performed time-resolved spectroscopy during Jan 28.84 - 28.91 with HOWPol. We also performed low-resolution spectroscopy with FBSPEC  II attached to a 40 cm reflector from Jan 28.84 to Feb 5.83 at Fujii Kurosaki Observatory (FKO). The wavelength coverage was 3800-8400 Å and the spectral resolution was R = λ  /  Δλ  ~  500 at 6000 Å. Additional spectra were obtained with SBIG DSS7 attached to a 28 cm reflector on 2010 Jan 28.840 and 29.846 at the observatory in Okayama University of Science (OUS). The wavelength coverage was 4200-8200 Å  and the spectral resolution was R = λ  /  Δλ  ~  400 at 6000 Å. The log of our spectroscopic observations is summarized in table 1. The data reductions of these data were performed according to a standard procedure using IRAF. The wavelength calibration was performed using the sky emission lines taken in the same frame.

Results

Overall Properties of Early Spectra

In figure 1, we show the spectra obtained on Jan 28.84 (td = 0.37 d), 28.86 (td = 0.39 d), 29.85 (td = 1.38 d) and Feb 2.79 (td = 5.32 d). We performed line identification by comparing with previous studies [\citep=Munari1999] [\citep=Anupama2000] [\citep=Iijima2002] and show them in figure 1. They are characterized by some strong emission lines having large FWZI (Full-Width at the Zero-Intensity) of ~  11000 km s- 1.

Blue-shifted narrow absorption lines are accompanied with some strong emission lines at td = 0.37 and 0.39 d. They are considerably weakened by td = 1.38 d and diminished by td = 5.32 d. The velocity of the absorption components are about - 5000, - 4600 and - 4500 km s- 1 for Balmer series, He  i and N  ii lines, respectively.

The profile of the Hα emission line consists of a central, red, and blue components at td≃0.4 d. The red and blue components have peaks at ~    ±  3000 km s- 1, as shown in figure 2. The red component is stronger than the blue one. A similar profile is seen in the spectrum in the 1999 outburst at tp = 0.45 d, which is the earliest spectrum taken in that outburst [\citep=Anupama2000]. In figure 3, we show the nightly variation of the whole Hα line in a logarithmic scale. At td = 1.38 d, the line profile is described as a nearly flat-topped one with weak blue and red peaks at ±  3000 km s- 1. The red peak is still higher than the blue one, as observed at td  ~  0.4 d. Then, the peak wavelength gradually shifts to the rest one between td  ~  5 and 9 d. At td = 9.38 d, the Hα line had a rather symmetric profile consisting of the flat-topped component and a narrower peak one. In the spectra at td = 16.36 and 22.39 d, the flat-topped component diminishes and the line profile is characterized with a single peak having a possible spread wing.

The Hβ, He  iλ5876 and He  iλ7065 emission lines exhibit the same behavior as Hα, except for the relative intensity of the blue and red peaks. The ratio of their blue and red peaks relative to the central one is higher than that of Hα, as can be seen in figure 2.

Spectral Variation on the First Night

As shown in figure 2, the intensity of the blue and red components of Hα increases more rapidly than that of the central one on the first night. The growth of the red component is apparently smooth, while that of the blue component may be more complicated, or weaker than the red one. Similarly, the Hβ and He  iλ5876 lines show a rapid increase in their red components. These rapidly-evolving components are seen not only around the red peak, but also in a rather wide range of velocity from 1000-4000 km s- 1 in Hα and He  iλ5876.

In the Hα line, the central peak is stronger than the red and blue ones on the first night, while the whole profile becomes a flat-topped one by td = 1.38 d. Hence, it is expected that the increase of the blue and red components continue until they became comparable to that of the central component. Thus, our observation on the first night traces the growing phase of the blue and red peaks. The observation epoch would correspond to the period of time that was overlooked in the case of the 1999 outburst, namely, between tp = 0.45 d [\citep=Anupama2000] and 0.65 d [\citep=Iijima2002] in the 1999 outburst.

Discussion

The intra-night variation of the blue and red components shown in figure 2 suggests that the emitting region has an aspherical shape that grows rapidly on the first night. [\citet=Gill1999] calculated line profiles using the models with aspherical structure of nova ejecta, like equatorial and tropical rings or polar caps, which generate blue and red peaks in the line profile. We propose that aspherical winds, such as suggested in [\citet=Gill1999], is the origin of the red (and blue) components. A bipolar jet-like structure has been suggested for U Sco to explain its large expansion velocity (see [\cite=MKato2003] and reference therein). A well-collimated narrow jet-like structure is expected to generate emission lines with a narrow velocity range. Since the rapidly-growing red components extend in a wide velocity range of 1000-4000 km s- 1 (see § 3.2), the observed line variation favors a wind-like structure with a large opening angle, rather than a well-collimated jet-like structure with a small opening angle. In contrast to the blue and red components, the central component, slowly growing relative to the red one, is probably attributed to a slower, nearly spherical wind.

The fact that the red component is stronger than the blue one on the first night implies that the wind is not only aspherical, but also non-axisymmetric. On the other hand, the blue component could also be supressed due to superposition of blue-shifted absorption components. The latter is plausible because blue-shifted absorption components are clearly seen at that phase. In addition, it is interesting that the orbital phase is close to zero during our observation; Phase= 0.05 at td = 0.37, as shown in table 1. This suggests that the secondary star is at near side and might give a partial occultation or a perturbation of the coming wind, leading to weaker blue components. This scenario is plausible only when the secondary star affects the velocity field of the ejecta significantly.

Another noteworthy feature of the line profile on the first night is that Hβ and He  iλ5876 have strong red components relative to Hα. In other words, the central component of Hβ and He  iλ5876 is relatively weak. This would reflect the difference in temperature of the emitting region. Typically, Hβ and He  iλ5876 may become stronger relatively to Hα in the case of higher electron temperature. The temperatures of the excitations of Hβ and He  iλ5876 are higher than that of Hα. The observed line profiles suggest that the possible asymmetric winds causing the red and blue components are highly excited compared with the slower, nearly spherical wind causing the central one.

The asymmetry of the nova ejecta has been discussed in many literature (e.g., [\cite=MacDonald1986] [\cite=Livio1990] [\cite=Porter1998] [\cite=Scott2000] [\cite=Gill2000] [\cite=Harman2003] [\cite=Kawabata2006]). In the 1999 outburst in U Sco, a significant polarization change across the Hα emission line was found at tp = 0.3 d and then diminished by tp = 2.2 d [\citep=Ikeda2000]. This result suggests that the earliest wind was asymmetric, which is consistent with the present work.

At td = 1.38 d, the line profile of Hα has a nearly flat-topped structure with weak blue and red peaks. This profile implies that the Hα emission is from a nearly spherical shell on the second night, while the asphericity growing on the first night still remains. At td  ~  9 d, the profile of the Hα line consists of the flat-topped component and another Gaussian component centered at the rest wavelength. The asymmetry in the line profile gradually becomes insignificant by td  ~  9 d. This indicates the asphericity of the wind is less significant by this time. Since the deceleration of the flat-topped component is not remarkable between td = 0.39 and 9.38 d, the spherical shell is likely to expand freely from the first night. The Gaussian component would be attributed to the decelerating nova wind near the white dwarf. By td  =  16.36 d, the flat-topped component diminishes. It is noted that the single-peaked Hα line after td = 16 d is similar to that in the same epoch of the 1987 outburts [\citep=Sekiguchi1988], while not consistent with those in 1979 and 1999 outbursts [\citep=Barlow1981] [\citep=Munari1999]. This may suggest that the geometry (shape and/or its axis) of the outburst is not always same among two consecutive outbursts. Additionally, the observed maximum of the outbursts in 1999 and 2010 are estimated to be the phase [formula] and 0.05, respectively. Assuming that the geometry of the outburst is not axi-symmetric and its shape depends on the binary phase at the onset of the outburst, we expect the apparent nature could change along different lines of sight. If this is the case, the high-velocity winds could be seen at the outburst begun around the phase of ~  0.4 [\citep=Munari1999].

Conclusion

We obtained the time-resolved spectra on the first night after the discovery of the 2010 outburst of U Sco, and found the rapid evolution of the profile of the Hα emission line. This is the first observational sample revealing the intra-night variability of the spectral lines just after the maximum brightness. The Hα emission line shows three components, which are, center, blue, and red ones on the first night. The blue and red components rapidly evolved, which would be caused by aspherically-structured winds. The line profile becomes rather symmetric and we cannot find any clear evidence for the wind asphericity after td = 9 d.
