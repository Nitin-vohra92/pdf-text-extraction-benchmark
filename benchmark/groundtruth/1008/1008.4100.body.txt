Pattern Recognition on Oriented Matroids: Halfspaces, Convex Sets and Tope Committees

Introduction

Let M = (Et,T) be a simple oriented matroid (it has no loops, parallel or antiparallel elements) on the ground set [formula], with set of topes T. Throughout we will suppose that M is not acyclic.

The family [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3, for the oriented matroid M is defined as the collection where T+e: = {T∈T: T(e) =  + } is the positive halfspace of M that corresponds to the element e, see [\cite=M-Layers] [\cite=M-Existence] [\cite=M-Three] [\cite=M-Reorientations]. The family of tope anti-committees, of cardinality k, for M is denoted by [formula]; by definition, [formula] iff [formula], where [formula].

Denote by [formula] the family of all k-subsets of the tope set T, and consider the families of tope subsets [formula], 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3, that is the families

[formula]

we have

For an element e∈Et, we let T-e: = {T∈T: T(e) =  - } denote the negative halfspace of M that corresponds to the element e. The family of all subsets, of cardinality j, of the positive halfspace T+e is denoted by [formula] and, similarly, [formula] denotes the family of i-subsets of the negative halfspace T-e. The family of (i + j)-sets [formula] is defined as the family [formula] [formula].

On the one hand, [formula], 3  ≤  k ≤  |T| - 3. On the other hand, a k-subset [formula] is a committee for M iff

the set [formula] contains no set from the family [formula];

the set [formula] contains at least one set from each family [formula], e∈Et -- in other words, the collection [formula] is a blocking family for the family [formula], that is, [formula] [formula] > 0, e∈Et.

As a consequence, the collection [formula] is the family of all blocking k-sets of topes for the family [formula], and a committee [formula] is minimal if any its proper i-subset [formula] is not a blocking set for the family [formula].

Based on these remarks, we calculate in Sections [\ref=s:4] and [\ref=s:2] the numbers [formula] of general committees of cardinality k, in several possible ways, by applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion [\cite=A] [\cite=St1] to subsets of maximal covectors contained in halfspaces of the oriented matroid M; in Section [\ref=s:2], these calculations involve the convex subsets of the ground set of M. In Section [\ref=s:3] we find the numbers [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, which contain no pairs of opposites. Sections [\ref=s:1], [\ref=s:5] and [\ref=s:6] list auxiliary results.

See [\cite=ERW] and references therein on acyclic, convex and free sets of oriented matroids.

One can associate to the oriented matroid M various " [formula]-vectors" (and their flag generalizations) whose components are the numbers of its tope committees of the corresponding cardinality, for example:

the vector [formula], where [formula] : =  [formula] -- recall that [formula] =   [formula], 1  ≤  k ≤  |T| - 1;

the vector [formula], where [formula] : =  [formula] -- note that [formula] whenever [formula] ≤  |T| - 1;

the vector [formula], where [formula] [formula];

the vector [formula], where [formula], the number of tope committees, of cardinality k, composed of topes from the set [formula] of all topes of M with inclusion-maximal positive parts,

and so on.

Let M: = (E6,T) be the simple oriented matroid represented by its third positive halfspace

a realization of its reorientation [formula], by a hyperplane arrangement in [formula], is shown in [\cite=M-Existence].

The oriented matroid M has 28 maximal covectors and 238012 tope committees --

Relative Blocking in Boolean Lattices

Let [formula] be a nontrivial antichain in the Boolean lattice [formula] of rank n, and [formula] the set of lattice complements of the elements of [formula] in [formula]; ρ(  ·  ) denotes the rank function, [formula] denotes the ith layer of [formula], and [formula] stands for the order ideal of the lattice [formula] generated by its antichain C.

For a rational number r, 0  ≤  r < 1, and for a positive integer number k, consider the subset

[formula]

that consists of the relatively r-blocking elements, of rank k, for the antichain [formula].

Set ν(r  ·  k): = ⌊r  ·  k⌋ + 1 and consider an antichain [formula] such that ρ(λ)  ≥  ν(r  ·  k) and n - ρ(λ)  ≥  k - ν(r  ·  k) + 1, for each element [formula], that is,

[formula]

If the antichain [formula] satisfies constraints ([\ref=eq:22]) then for an element b' [formula] we have [formula] iff b' > d' for at least one element d' of rank k - ν(r  ·  k) + 1 = k - ⌊r  ·  k⌋ such that [formula]; therefore, on the one hand,

[formula]

On the other hand, for an element [formula] the inclusion [formula] holds iff for each element [formula] we have [formula], for any element θλ [formula], that is, and we have

[formula]

(where [formula] stands for the set of minimal elements of a subposet) or, via Vandermonde's convolution,

[formula]

One more inclusion-exclusion type formula for the cardinality of the set [formula], for an antichain [formula] such that ρ(λ)  ≥  ν(r  ·  k), for all [formula], is given in [\cite=M-Relative]: if

[formula]

then

[formula]

We now refine formulas ([\ref=eq:13]), ([\ref=eq:15]) and ([\ref=eq:16]) with the help of the Möbius function [\cite=A] [\cite=St1], see below expressions ([\ref=eq:28]), ([\ref=eq:29]) and ([\ref=eq:30]), respectively. Let X be a nontrivial antichain in the Boolean lattice [formula]. Denote by [formula] X) the sub-join-semilattice of [formula] generated by the set X and augmented by a new least element [formula]; the greatest element [formula] of the lattice [formula] is the join [formula] in [formula]. The Möbius function of the lattice [formula] is denoted by μE(  ·  ,  ·  ).

Let [formula] be a nontrivial antichain in the Boolean lattice [formula] that complies with constraints ([\ref=eq:22]). We have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

A companion formula to ([\ref=eq:17]) is given in [\cite=M-Relative]: let [formula] be an antichain that obeys constraint ([\ref=eq:23]), and let [formula] be the join-semilattice of all sets from the family [formula] ordered by inclusion and augmented by a new least element [formula]; the greatest element [formula] of the lattice [formula] is the set [formula]. We denote the Möbius function of [formula] by μC(  ·  ,  ·  ). We have

[formula]

Halfspaces and Tope Committees

Let [formula] be the Boolean lattice of all subsets of the tope set T, and Υ [formula] its antichain whose element υe represents in [formula] the eth positive halfspace T+e of the oriented matroid M. The family [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3, for M is represented in the lattice [formula] by the antichain thanks to axiomatic symmetry T =  - T, see [\cite=BLSWZ], the cardinality of this set is

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq:13]). Note that for an integer j, 1  ≤  j  ≤  |T| / 2, we have where [formula] denotes the meet-semilattice of convex subsets of the ground set Et, and [formula]; [formula] denotes the least element of [formula]. Recall that from the algebraic combinatorial point of view [\cite=BI], the set [formula] is a subset in the Johnson association scheme [formula] on the set [formula], with the partition [formula] [formula] of [formula], defined by [formula], for all 0  ≤  i  ≤  j.

Reformulate observation ([\ref=eq:6]) in the following way:

[formula]

where [formula]; this formula counts the number of all blocking k-sets of topes for the family [formula], cf. ([\ref=eq:15]), and it counts the number of all blocking (|T| - k)-sets of topes for the family [formula]. We can also rewrite ([\ref=eq:6]) by means of Vandermonde's convolution in the form:

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=eq:16]), that is,

[formula]

where [formula].

If G is a family of tope subsets then we denote by [formula] the join-semilattice [formula] composed of the unions of the sets from the family G ordered by inclusion and augmented by a new least element [formula]; the greatest element [formula] of the lattice [formula] is the set [formula]. The Möbius function of the poset [formula] is denoted by [formula].

Expressions ([\ref=eq:25]) and ([\ref=eq:26]) below refine formulas ([\ref=eq:5]) and ([\ref=eq:24]), respectively.

The number [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3, for the oriented matroid M: = (Et,T), is:

(i)

[formula]

where [formula].

(ii)

[formula]

where [formula].

Let [formula] be the join-semilattice of all sets from the family [formula] ordered by inclusion and augmented by a new least element [formula]. The greatest element [formula] of the lattice [formula] is the set [formula]. Similarly, for an element [formula] we denote by [formula] the sub-join-semilattice of [formula] generated by the set [formula] and augmented by a new least element [formula]. The Möbius functions of the posets [formula] and [formula] are denoted by μC(  ·  ,  ·  ) and μE(  ·  ,  ·  ), respectively.

Using ([\ref=eq:19]), we obtain the expression

[formula]

Restate ([\ref=eq:27]) in the following way:

The number [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3, for the oriented matroid M: = (Et,T), is

[formula]

where [formula]; [formula] denotes the Möbius function of the family [formula] [formula] ordered by inclusion.

Convex Sets and Tope Committees

Let the antichain [formula] again represent the family of positive halspaces of the oriented matroid M in the Boolean lattice [formula] of all subsets of the tope set T. We have

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=eq:17]).

Consider the mapping

[formula]

that sends a (⌈(k + 1) / 2⌉)-subset of topes [formula] to the inclusion-maximum convex subset A  ⊂  Et with the property d  ⊆  T+A; we are actually interested in such a mapping to the subposet [formula], the order ideal of the semilattice [formula] defined as [formula] [formula].

Fix a nonempty subset [formula] and consider the blocker [formula] of the image γk(D); if we let [formula] denote the subfamily of all inclusion-minimal sets from the family γk(D) then [formula] [formula].

Let [formula] be the abstract simplicial complex whose facets are the complements Et - B of the sets [formula] from the blocker of the Sperner family [formula], and let Δ(D) be the complex whose facets are the complements Et - G of the sets [formula]; if the complexes Δ(D) and [formula] have the same vertex set then [formula] is the Alexander dual of Δ(D). The reduced Euler characteristics [formula] of the complexes satisfy the equality [formula].

For a subset [formula] we have [formula] iff the collection of indices [formula] is a blocking set for the family [formula]; therefore If [formula] then the complex [formula] is a cone and, as a consequence, [formula].

Rewrite ([\ref=eq:1]) in the following way:

[formula]

note that singleton sets D: = {d}, where [formula], do not play a rôle in ([\ref=eq:2]).

Given a subset [formula] such that [formula], let S(D) denote the family of the unions [formula] #  F > 0} ordered by inclusion and augmented by a new least element [formula]; the greatest element [formula] of the lattice S(D) is the ground set Et. The reduced Euler characteristic [formula] of the complex Δ(D) is equal to the Möbius number μS(D)(,) and, in particular, to [formula] when the sets in the family [formula] are pairwise disjoint. Restate observation ([\ref=eq:2]):

The number [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3, for the oriented matroid M: = (Et,T), is

[formula]

where [formula].

Consider the abstract simplicial complex whose facets are the positive halfspaces of the oriented matroid M. If some its relevant (⌈(k + 1) / 2⌉ - 1)-dimensional faces, sets from the family [formula], are free -- each of them is contained in exactly one facet T+e, for some element e∈Et -- then the Möbius numbers μS(G)(,) in ([\ref=eq:7]), under [formula], are all equal to ( - 1)t:

Let k be an integer, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| - 3. If for any family [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], it holds |γk(G)| = 1, for any set G∈G, then the number [formula] of tope committees, of cardinality k, for the oriented matroid M: = (Et,T), is

[formula]

Relative Blocking in Posets Isomorphic to the Face Lattices of Crosspolytopes

Consider a poset [formula], with the rank function ρ(  ·  ), which is isomorphic to the graded face meet-semilattice of the boundary of a m-dimensional crosspolytope and is defined in the following way: the semilattice [formula] is composed of all subsets, free of opposites, of a set { - m, [formula], ordered by inclusion. We denote by [formula] the lattice [formula] [formula], where [formula] is a new greatest element. Let [formula] be a nontrivial antichain in the lattice [formula].

For a rational number r, 0  ≤  r < 1, and for a positive integer number k, we define the set [formula] of relatively r-blocking elements, of rank k, for the antichain [formula] in analogy with the sets [formula] for antichains in Boolean lattices, cf. ([\ref=eq:12]):

[formula]

where [formula] is the kth layer of the semilattice [formula].

On the one hand, we have

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=eq:19]), where [formula] denotes the join-semilattice of all sets from the family [formula] ordered by inclusion and augmented by a new least element [formula]; the greatest element [formula] of the lattice [formula] is the set [formula]. For an element [formula], the notation [formula] is used to denote the sub-join-semilattice of the lattice [formula] generated by the set [formula], with the greatest element of [formula] deleted from it, and augmented by a new least element [formula]. The Möbius functions of the posets [formula] and [formula] are denoted by [formula] and [formula], respectively; ρ(  ·  ) denotes the rank of an element in the poset [formula].

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=eq:17]).

Tope Committees Containing no Pairs of Opposites

Counting tope committees, that are free of opposites, for the oriented matroid M, we follow the reasoning scheme from Section [\ref=s:2], but we work now with the family [formula] of tope subsets that are free of opposites and ordered by inclusion; the semilattice [formula] is isomorphic to the face poset of the boundary of a crosspolytope of dimension |T| / 2. The lattice [formula] [formula] is the semilattice [formula] augmented by a new greatest element [formula]. We again turn to the mapping [formula] [formula] defined in ([\ref=eq:3]), and to the lattices S(  ·  ) considered in Section [\ref=s:2].

If G is a family of tope subsets which are free of opposites then we denote by [formula] the join-semilattice [formula] [formula] composed of the unions, free of opposites, of the sets from the family G ordered by inclusion and augmented by a new least element [formula]; the Möbius function of the poset [formula] is denoted by [formula].

Formula ([\ref=eq:21]) below is deduced from ([\ref=eq:20]). Formulas ([\ref=eq:9]) and ([\ref=eq:10]) are deduced from ([\ref=eq:18]); they are direct analogues of formulas ([\ref=eq:7]) and ([\ref=eq:11]), respectively. See also [\cite=M-Reorientations].

The number [formula] of tope committees which are free of opposites, of cardinality k, 3  ≤  k  ≤  |T| / 2, for the oriented matroid M : = (Et,T), is:

(i)

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Möbius function of the family [formula] [formula] ordered by inclusion.

(ii)

[formula]

In particular, if for any family [formula] such that [formula] is free of opposites, [formula] = Et and [formula], it holds |γk(G)| = 1, for any set G∈G, then

[formula]

Relative Blocking in Principal Order Ideals of Binomial Posets

In this section we mention an analogue of formula ([\ref=eq:2]) in the more general context of binomial posets.

Let P be a graded lattice of rank n which is a principal order ideal of some binomial poset. The factorial function [formula] of P counts the number of maximal chains in any interval of length k in P. The number [formula] of elements of rank i in an interval of length j in P is equal to [formula], see [\cite=St1].

Let [formula] be a nontrivial antichain in the lattice P. If r is a rational number, 0  ≤  r < 1, and k is a positive integer, then the set [formula] of relatively r-blocking elements, of rank k, for the antichain [formula] in P, is defined as follows: where ρ(  ·  ) is the rank function of P, and P(k) is the kth layer of P.

Let [formula] be the abstract simplicial complex whose facets are the inclusion-maximal sets of indices [formula] such that for the corresponding antichains [formula] it holds [formula], where [formula] is the least element of P. If the poset P is the Boolean lattice [formula] then the complex [formula] is the nerve of the corresponding Sperner family; see, e.g., [\cite=B-TM] on the topological combinatorics of the nerve.

Set ν(r  ·  k): = ⌊r  ·  k⌋ + 1. Let

[formula]

be the mapping that reflects an element d, of rank ν(r  ·  k), of the order ideal [formula] generated by the antichain [formula] to the inclusion-maximum face of the complex [formula] with the property [formula].

Associate to a subset [formula], such that [formula] [formula], a poset S(D) which is the family [formula] > 0} ordered by inclusion, with a new least element [formula] adjoined; here [formula] denotes the subfamily of all inclusion-minimal sets from the image [formula]. Let μS(D)(,) denote the corresponding Möbius number, where [formula] is the greatest element of S(D).

Suppose that [formula]. Since

[formula]

by [\cite=M-Relative], we have
