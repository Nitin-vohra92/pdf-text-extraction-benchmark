Remarkable evolutionary laws of absolute and relative entropies with dynamical systems

In thermodynamics, it is well known that entropy production is closely related to phase space contraction[\cite=thermo_entropy]. In information theory, similar relation has also been established; particularly, in the context of a deterministic system, it has been shown that the time evolution of absolute entropy, namely Shannon entropy, is precisely equal to the mathematical expectation of the divergence of the flow (cf. Eq. ([\ref=eq:entropy_gov]) below)[\cite=LK05]. This elegant relation has since led to the establishment of a rigorous formalism of information flow (or information transfer as referred to in the literature), a fundamental notion in general phsyics which has broad applications in a variety of disciplines[\cite=LK05][\cite=Liang].

However, it has also been well known that absolute entropy, denoted H henceforth, need not be consistent with the second law of thermodynamics[\cite=Cove] which states that the entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease as time goes on. Although the connection between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is still on debate[\cite=debate], it would be better to have the former put on a physical footing. In this case, naturally one would ask under what circumstances the consistency may be established. This forms one of the questions we want to address in this study.

On the other hand, relative entropy (hereafter D) does comply with the second law of thermodynamics[\cite=Cove]. This important property, among others, makes D an ideal physical measure in many contexts, as recognized by Kleeman (2002), and has let to a resurgence of interest in it during the past decade in different applications[\cite=rela_entropy]. Considering that H has a concise evolutionary law, one naturally wonders how D evolves. In [\cite=Cove], this is discussed in the framework of a Markov chain, and obtained is an inequality like the afore-mentioned second law. But somehow the result is too generic; in the context of a dynamical system, it could have a more specific and, hopefully, more definite statement. Indeed, as we will see soon, relative entropy is actually conserved with deterministic systems. This remarkable result, together with others, are what we are about to derive in the following.

First consider an n-dimensional deterministic system with randomness limited within initial conditions:

[formula]

where [formula] are the state variables. Associated with [formula] there is a joint probability density function, [formula], and hence an absolute entropy

[formula]

and a relative entropy

[formula]

with some reference density q of [formula]. We are interested in how H and D evolve with respect to ([\ref=eq:gov]). For this purpose, assume that ρ, q, and their derviatives are all compactly supported; further assume enough regularity for ρ, q, D, and H. The mathematics involved here is neglected for a broad readership; those who feel interested may consult [\cite=Cove] for a detailed discussion. Note the choosing of the reference density q is slightly different from what people are using these days[\cite=rela_entropy] in applications, particularly in predictability studies, who usually choose it to be some constant distribution (initial distribution, for example). We require that q also evolve, and that it follow the same evolution as ρ does. Only in this way can we have the neat result on D, as will be derived soon. (Perhaps this is the reason why the following result was not seen before, as the past studies have focused on the choice of a constant q.)

Corresponding to ([\ref=eq:gov]) there is a Liouville equation

[formula]

governing the evolution of the joint density ρ. Multiplying ([\ref=eq:liouville]) by - (1 +  log ρ) and integrating over [formula], Liang and Kleeman obtain that[\cite=LK05]

where the operator E stands for mathematical expectation (refer to [\cite=LK05] for the derivation). In arriving at this formula, originally it is assumed that extreme events have a probability of zero, which corresponds to our above compact support assumption. This makes sense in practice and has been justified in [\cite=LK05], but even this assumption may be relaxed, and the same formula follows[\cite=Liang].

For the relative entropy D, differentiation of ([\ref=eq:D]) with respect to t gives

[formula]

The integrals are all understood to be over [formula], and this simplification will be used hereafter, unless otherwise indicated. The two shorthands are:

[formula]

So

[formula]

Recall that q is also a joint density of [formula], so its evolution must follow the same Liouville equation, i.e.,

[formula]

The relative entropy evolution ([\ref=eq:tmp1]) thus becomes

[formula]

Substitution of ([\ref=eq:entropy_gov]) for [formula] gives

That is to say, relative entropy is conserved.

The above results are now generalized to systems with stochasticity included. Let [formula] be an array of n standard Wiener processes, and [formula] a matrix which may have dependency on both [formula] and t. The system we are to consider has the form:

[formula]

Correspondingly the density evolves according to a Fokker-Planck equation

[formula]

where [formula] is a nonnegatively definite matrix. The double dot product here is defined such that, for column vectors [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula],

[formula]

A dyad [formula] in matrix notation is identified with [formula].

Multiplication of ([\ref=eq:fokker]) by - (1 +  log ρ), followed by an integration over the entire sample space [formula], yields an evolution of the absolute entropy

[formula]

In arriving at the first term on the right hand, the previous result (i.e., ([\ref=eq:entropy_gov])) with the Liouville equation has been applied. For the second term, since [formula] by the compact support assumption, it results in

[formula]

where integration by parts has been used. So

[formula]

One of our purposes for this study is to see whether the evolution of H can be reconciled to comply with the second law of thermodynamics, by taking away the effect of phase space volume change, i.e., [formula] in this formula. That is to say, we would like to see whether [formula] is non-positive. Unfortunately, this need not be true in general. However, if [formula] is constant in [formula] or, in other words, if the noise is additive, then [formula] can be taken out of the expectation. Integrating by parts,

[formula]

Because [formula] is nonnegatively definite, [formula], hence

[formula]

That is to say, in this case, systems without phase volume expansion/contraction in the deterministic limit (such as the Hamiltonian system), absolute entropy is in accordance with the second thermodynamic law.

It is interesting to note that the above formula ([\ref=eq:dH_additive]) may be linked to Fisher information if the parameters, say μi, of the distribution are bound to the state variables in a form of translation such as that in a Gaussian process. In this case, one can replace the partial derivatives with respect to xi by that with respect to μi. And, accordingly,

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fisher information matrix. So

[formula]

Next look at the relative entropy ([\ref=eq:D]). For the reference density q, it is also governed by the Fokker-Planck equation, which reads

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=eq:fokker]) and ([\ref=eq:fokkerq]) into the identity

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula], and then integrating over [formula], we get

[formula]

Subtracting ([\ref=eq:fokker_H]) from above gives the time evolution of the relative entropy:

[formula]

Integrating by parts, and using the compact support assumption, this becomes

[formula]

Because of the nonnegative definiteness of [formula], the right hand side is always smaller than or equal to zero, in accordance with the thermodynamic entropy. (Notice the negative sign in the definition of D; that is to say, increase in H corresponds to decrease in D.)

We have studied the evoluationary laws for absolute entropy H and relative entropy D with respect to dynamical systems. For easy reference, the derived formulas are wrapped up here. If the system of concern is deterministic, i.e., in the form of ([\ref=eq:gov]), then

[formula]

If the system has stochasticity included, as that in ([\ref=eq:gov2]), then

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Among the four formuas, ([\ref=eq:entropy_gov]) was known before, the rest were obtained in this letter. From them we see that generally absolute entropy does not comply with the second law of thermodynamics, unless the flow of the deterministic vector field is nondivergent (as that in a Hamiltonian system) and the noisy perturbation is additive. The relative entropy, in contrast, proves to be non-increasing all the time, in accordance with the second law. The dissipative mechanism has a form remniscient of the Fisher information.

Of particular interest among the above formulas are those for deterministic systems. They have important implications from both theoretical and applied points of view. For example, drifter releasing as one of the oldest methods of studying ocean circulation has built up for oceanic scientists a huge database; but the drifter trajectories are usually chaotic and are difficult to analyze. Here ([\ref=eq:re_entropy_gov]) and ([\ref=eq:entropy_gov]) may come to help by offering two constraints. The former tells that the relative entropy is conserved. For the latter, the sea water is incompressible and hence the oceanic flow is divergence free. So by ([\ref=eq:entropy_gov]) the absolute entropy of these trajectories is also a constant. Equally this applies to the study of atmospheric pollutant dispersion. Though the air is compressible, but in an isobaric frame it is not, and hence atmospheric flows are also divergence free. So in isobaric coordinates the pollutant trajectories must also conserve their absolute entropy, as well as the relative entropy.

Relative entropy has an interpretation that it measures the distance between two functions ρ and q in the function space [formula] (i.e., integrable functions)[\cite=Cove], although it does not meet all the axioms for a metric. This interpretation makes the relative entropy conservation law, namely ([\ref=eq:re_entropy_gov]), theoretically very interesting. To see this, examine a nonlinear system that is sensitive to initial perturbations. The sensitivity is quantitatively characterized by the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE), which measures the exponential growth of the separation of two trajectories closely placed in the beginning[\cite=chaos_book]. More specifically, if the Lyapunov exponent is λ, and the distance between two trajectories is δ(t), then [formula] Usually a system is considered as chaotic if the MLE is positive; corespondingly the predictability is quickly lost. Now, the relative entropy conservation law tells that, if instead of studying the evolution of the state variables [formula], we study the evolution of their joint density [formula], the "trajectories" in the new "phase space" [formula] will have equal separations all the time. That is to say, although the trajectories of [formula] may be chaotic, the "trajectories" of [formula] are not, and the corresponding Lyapunov exponent λ will always be zero.

The above observation is expected to have important implications in the the active research field, ensemble prediction. Realizing the limited predictability of nonlinear dynamical systems, during the past decades there has been a surge of interest in ensemble prediction, for instance, ensemble weather prediction[\cite=ensemble]. The implication is two-fold. Firstly, the law rationalizes the prediction technique, in that it assures the insensitivity of the distribution to initial conditions. In this sense, the conservation law may be taken as the theoretical basis of ensemble prediction. Seondly, the law imposes a constaint on the numerical schemes designed for prediction. We know, in approximating the differential operators in a (deterministic) system for numerical computation, the underlying physics is, more or less, changed. For instance, artifical damping at each step may be used to ensure numerical stability; stochasticity may be deliberately introduced to parameterize the processes that cannot be resolved by the model grids; the ensemble size may be too small to cover the sample space, and so forth. For high dimensional problems such as weather forecast, the latter is particularly severe, as the integration is very expensive. All these may lead to a non-conservative relative entropy, and hence the resulting prediction may not be able to reflect the real statistical physics underyling the system. How to design a relative entropy conservative scheme is, therefore, of interest for ensemble predictions with high dimensional systems. We leave this to future studies.
