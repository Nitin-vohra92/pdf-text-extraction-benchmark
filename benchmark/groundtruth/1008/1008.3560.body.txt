All the lowest order PDE for spectral gaps of Gaussian matrices

Introduction: Schlesinger-TW Equations and τ-functions

We consider the unitary ensembles (UE) of Hermitian random matrices. Various large n limits for this case belong to important widespread universality classes: bulk limit leads to equations for the sine kernel [\cite=JMMS] [\cite=TW1] [\cite=Me04] whereas edge limit (largest eigenvalues) leads to Airy kernel [\cite=TW-Airy] [\cite=TW1] [\cite=Me04]. One studies the operator KJ with the kernel KJ(x,y)  =  K(x,y)χJc(y), where K(x,y)  =  (φ(x)ψ(y)  -  ψ(y)φ(x)) / (x - y) and χJc(y) is equal to zero on J and one on its complement Jc in [formula]. Important for this theory is the resolvent kernel of K (we will use short-hand notation K for KJ), R(x,y), the kernel of K(I - K)- 1, which is defined by the operator identity

[formula]

One introduces [\cite=JMMS] [\cite=IIKS] [\cite=TW1] the auxiliary functions

[formula]

and auxiliary inner products [\cite=TW1], which are functions of only the endpoints ak of J,

[formula]

Then the resolvent kernel R(x,y) is [\cite=JMMS] [\cite=IIKS] [\cite=TW1]

[formula]

and (prime denotes the derivative w.r.t. x, e.g. Q'(x;J)  =  dQ(x;J) / dx)

[formula]

The Tracy-Widom (TW) equations for one-matrix case are the equations for the functions of the endpoints -- R(aj,ak),

[formula]

and the auxiliary functions u, v, w. Among them there are universal equations valid for any Hermitian one-matrix unitarily invariant model. They read [\cite=TW1]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for j  ≠  k and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By definitions of the matrix integral over Jn (or J∞), τJ, and the resolvent operator R, we have the fundamental relation between them, expressed by the first equation in formula ([\ref=eq:Rj]). This is just a consequence of the defining connection, the equality of two different expressions for the probability of all eigenvalues to lie in J,

[formula]

where τ is the corresponding matrix integral over whole [formula]. The integrals τJ and τ can be considered as particular values of certain τ-functions of integrable hierarchies, see e.g. [\cite=ASvM] [\cite=AvM7] [\cite=PvM2007].

The other equations are not universal, their particular form depends on the potential V(x). Let

[formula]

Then the non-universal equations are

[formula]

[formula]

along with

[formula]

The above equations are equivalent to the Schlesinger equations involving 2  ×  2 matrices Aj,

[formula]

see [\cite=HarTW] [\cite=Pal] and [\cite=UniUE] for details.

The paper is organized as follows. In section two we show our general form of equations derived from the above. In section 3 we specify it to the GUE ensemble and obtain explicitly all independent third order PDE for its gap probabilities, for arbitrary number of spectral endpoints. In section 4 we consider the simplest representative example of two endpoints for GUE in more detail, show that some of the previous third order equations are redundant in this case and expose also a second order PDE (lower order than Painlevé IV analogs!) satisfied by GUE probabilities. In section 5 we derive the results of section 2 which are the basis for all the rest. In the appendix we demonstrate the application of Adler-Shiota-van Moerbeke approach [\cite=ASvM]-[\cite=AvM7] to GUE probabilities based on our system from [\cite=IR1]. The last sections presents the conclusions.

The results. General case

The system of Schlesinger-TW equations can be reduced in general to the following convenient form, which, at least for the Gaussian case, will immediately give all the 3-rd order PDE in the logarithm of the gap probability, [formula], without intermediate higher-order PDE to integrate.

There are several series of universal equations independent of potential (i.e. of Xj, Yj defined below): the two "1-point" equations,

[formula]

[formula]

and the four series of "2-point" equations,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Also there are two series of non-universal equations where the data dependent on the potential ("spectral curve") enter, let Xj  =  qj' / qj, Yj  =  pj' / pj, then

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula], [formula], T  =   ln τJ, definitions of F and Gj are somewhat different for finite size n and infinite matrices. For finite n

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For infinite ensembles

[formula]

[formula]

We observe that we have 4 series of 1-point equations (depending on one subscript j) and 4 series of 2-point equations (depending on two subscripts, j and l). This means that for the case of N spectral endpoints the total number of equations here is 4N  +  4N(N - 1) / 2  =  2N(N + 1). The model-dependent functions are supposed to be ultimately expressed in terms of the variables T, v, F and [formula]. Then the number of dependent variables in the equations is going to be equal to N  +  3. We get only an upper bound on the number of independent PDE for the single function T only, assuming that the other N + 2 variables are eliminated, reducing the number of equations by N + 2:

[formula]

As we will see below on the example of GUE, the actual number of independent equations for T is less than this bound. It seems difficult to determine the exact number in general.

Multiplying the equations ([\ref=eq:Dvj]) and ([\ref=eq:Tj]) by akj with an integer k  ≥  0 and summing over the endpoints aj, one gets

The model-specific equations for one-matrix UE can be presented in the following general form in terms of operators {Bk,k  ≥   - 1} of Virasoro subalgebra:

[formula]

[formula]

where we denoted [formula] and [formula].

Multiplying the universal "2-point" equations by akjaml, then summing over j and l and introducing quantities

[formula]

leads to

The four common series of equations for all one-matrix UE in terms of operators {Bk,k  ≥   - 1} of Virasoro subalgebra read:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

All the other equations that UE satisfy in terms of the operators Bk only, are combinations of these equations and their derivatives.

It is worth to write out explicitly the components k,0 and k,k of the "multivariable Painlevé-type" series ([\ref=eq:hPkm]), which contains indeed all multivariable generalizations of Painlevé equations:

[formula]

[formula]

One can eliminate Gj-variables using equations ([\ref=eq:Pj]), ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) and ([\ref=eq:Ajl]) and obtain 2 independent series of universal PDE containing only T and functions v and F, which, for finite size ensembles, are related to T as [\cite=UniUE] v  =    -  ∂tT|t = 0 and F  =  ∂2ttT|t = 0, where t is the first time of one-dimensional Toda lattice hierarchy [\cite=AvM7] [\cite=IR1]. They can be written as e.g.

For any two spectral endpoints aj and al, the following two PDE hold for all one-matrix UE:

[formula]

[formula]

All the other such equations that UE satisfy are combinations of these and their derivatives.

Remark. In the previous paper we used a higher-order PDE,

[formula]

which is in fact the eq. ([\ref=eq:Tj*]) where ∂jGj has been eliminated using the derivative of eq. ([\ref=eq:Pj]) w.r.t. aj. Then from eqs. ([\ref=eq:Pj]) and ([\ref=eq:Fjj*]) one obtains the higher-order universal "1-point" PDE of our previous paper [\cite=UniUE],

[formula]

while the eqs. ([\ref=eq:Tvjl]) and ([\ref=eq:TvFjl]) are "2-point" equations.

Results for the Gaussian case

For the Gaussian case the expressions for the non-universal quantities Xj and Yj can be found [\cite=TW1] and written as

[formula]

[formula]

so the two non-universal equations ([\ref=eq:Dvj]) and ([\ref=eq:Tj]) give, respectively,

[formula]

[formula]

Then the linear equation ([\ref=eq:Ljl]) together with the last two relations result in formulas

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, all auxiliary variables are expressed in terms of T. Substituting these expressions into the other universal equations one finds the following two theorems:

The logarithm T of a spectral gap probability for GUE satisfies the following "1-point" 3rd order equations:

[formula]

[formula]

All the other such equations it satisfies are combinations of these and their derivatives.

Eq. ([\ref=eq:Tj*g]), however, becomes trivial in the case of one endpoint, while in the case of two endpoints the two such equations are a consequence of the other ones, see the next section. Whether this is the case in general, remains unclear at the moment.

The logarithm T of a spectral gap probability for GUE satisfies the following "2-point" 3rd order equations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

All the other such equations it satisfies are combinations of these and their derivatives.

We can now count the total number of third order PDE for the logarithm of GUE gap probabilities. We got two 1-point series and three 2-point series of equations, therefore in the case of N endpoints aj one has 2N  +  3N(N - 1) / 2  =  N(3N + 1) / 2 independent PDE. This should be reduced by 1 for N = 1 since then ([\ref=eq:Tj*g]) is trivial and we are left with ([\ref=eq:Pjg]) only.

The last three series of PDE have their counterparts in terms of B-operators only. Since for the case of GUE we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

we obtain immediately, either from theorem 3 or from theorem 6,

The logarithm T of a spectral gap probability for GUE satisfies the following equations in terms of operators {Bk,k  ≥   - 1} of Virasoro subalgebra:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

All the other equations in terms of the operators Bk it satisfies are combinations of these and their derivatives.

In fact, eq. ([\ref=eq:Pj]) can be considered as eq. ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) for aj  =  al, therefore, summing ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) over both subscripts j and l, we get the component in a sense corresponding to ([\ref=eq:Pj]) also, namely, for GUE - the "diagonal" equation ([\ref=eq:hPkmg]) with m  =  k. The total number of algebraically independent equations in the three series is thus 3N(N - 1) / 2  +  N  =  N(3N - 1) / 2 in the case of N endpoints. It is less than the total number of 1-point and 2-point equations above by N, as should be since equations ([\ref=eq:Tj*g]) do not have a counterpart here.

E.g. the simplest members of the three series are, respectively,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:hP00]) was first found by comparison of two 4th order PDE - the "boundary-KP" equation of [\cite=ASvM] and another one derived by the author from "boundary-Toda-AKNS" system of [\cite=IR1], see Appendix. Now the general procedure to obtain all the lowest order equations at once, wherever possible, is outlined.

Example: Gaussian case with two endpoints

We start with general equations of theorem 1. However, let us introduce notations which will be convenient for Gaussian two-endpoint case. If the two endpoints are aj and al, then let

[formula]

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

In the new notation equations of theorem 1 read as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Adding and subtracting the first two equations above, one gets, respectively,

[formula]

[formula]

Adding and subtracting ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) from ([\ref=eq:P+]) gives, respectively,

[formula]

[formula]

The non-universal equations for the Gaussian two-endpoint case give

[formula]

[formula]

and already known expressions for v and F in terms of T. One sees again that ([\ref=eq:Ljl]) is satisfied. Denoting also

[formula]

one finds expressions

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using all these expressions, we can rewrite our system of PDE as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and equations ([\ref=eq:Tj*]) and ([\ref=eq:Tl*]) reduce after a long tedious calculation to the following two equations,

[formula]

[formula]

Let us denote also

[formula]

Then, expressing DA from ([\ref=eq:Ajl])

[formula]

and then D- - from ([\ref=eq:Gjl]),

[formula]

Substituting these expressions into ([\ref=eq:rA]) and ([\ref=eq:SA]), one sees that the last equations become trivial. Thus, they are also redundant, i.e. are consequences of the rest of the system.

One can notice a lot of similarity with the final system of PDE for joint largest eigenvalue probabilities of two coupled GUE, see the Corollary in section 6 of [\cite=IR3]. This is to be expected in light of the representation of the matrix model with one finite size spectral gap in terms of models of two coupled matrices in [\cite=BoDaEy], p. 6745. More, however, remains to be understood about these relations.

We are left with five independent PDE involving four independent third derivatives of T. This means that there should be one second order PDE in T, i.e. equation of lower order than multidimensional analogs of Painlevé IV. Indeed, this equation can be easily obtained, if we express (D2rDS)2 from eq. ([\ref=eq:Px]) and compare with its expression obtained from the corresponding product of ([\ref=eq:P-r]) and ([\ref=eq:Ps]). It reads as

[formula]

It becomes trivial upon the identification of the two endpoints as it should be. The analogous equation for GUE can be obtained also in general, for any number of endpoints. This follows by expressing (∂jF∂lF)2 from ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) and comparing with its expression from the corresponding product of ([\ref=eq:Pj]) and ([\ref=eq:Pl]), now for any pair of endpoints aj and al. Thus, we obtain

The logarithm of a GUE gap probability T satisfies a second order PDE,

[formula]

[formula]

Transformation of the TW-Schlesinger system

Here mostly the derivations of the statements in the previous sections are gathered.

An important identity is obvious from definitions in section 1:

[formula]

Taking the second derivatives of u, v and w and using the equations for derivatives of qj and pj, one can obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The fisrt derivatives of T can be written in two different ways: on the one hand, by ([\ref=eq:Rj]), ([\ref=eq:qjj]) and ([\ref=eq:pjj]),

[formula]

on the other hand, by ([\ref=eq:Rj]) and ([\ref=eq:uj])-([\ref=eq:wj]),

[formula]

The terms in the sum of the first formula can be also represented as

[formula]

Switching to the variables U, W, Xj, Yj introduced above, one can rewrite the equations as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now we express everything in terms of new functions F and Gj defined in the statement of theorem 1. The first simple identity becomes

[formula]

which is nothing but the equation ([\ref=eq:Pj]). Mixed second derivative equations now read as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

[formula]

By definitions, either ([\ref=eq:Fn]) and ([\ref=eq:Gn]) or ([\ref=eq:Finf]) and ([\ref=eq:Ginf]), there are also equations of Adler-van Moerbeke type [\cite=AvM1],

[formula]

see [\cite=IR3] for the discussion of their analog for coupled GUE joint distributions first derived in [\cite=AvM1]. The last equation together with ([\ref=eq:Ajl]) means that a general linear PDE holds:

[formula]

The diagonal equations then read:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using the above equation ([\ref=eq:Ajl]) and the diagonal equation for ∂2jjv, the second derivatives ∂2jlv can be summed over all l, giving

[formula]

For ∂jT one has expressions

[formula]

and

[formula]

If we sum over j the first of these two equations, the last sum on its right-hand side cancels out since its terms are antisymmetric in indices j and l, so we obtain

[formula]

The second derivatives of F, entering eqs. ([\ref=eq:Fjl]) and ([\ref=eq:Fjj]), can in fact be removed from consideration. This is because we can take the corresponding derivatives of equation ([\ref=eq:Pj]) and compare with ([\ref=eq:Fjl]) and ([\ref=eq:Fjj]). The result is that equation ([\ref=eq:Fjl]) is redundant - it follows from the derivative of ([\ref=eq:Pj]) w.r.t. al and the other equations. As for the equation ([\ref=eq:Fjj]), its comparison with the derivative of ([\ref=eq:Pj]) w.r.t. aj,

[formula]

gives immediately the equation ([\ref=eq:Tj*]), which is thus also proved. As we will see, at least for Gaussian case using eq. ([\ref=eq:Tj*]) is preferable since it encodes a third order PDE for T, while ([\ref=eq:Fjj]) corresponds to a fourth order PDE in T. So we keep ([\ref=eq:Tj*]) and then ([\ref=eq:Fjj]) is also redundant.

Thus, what remains to prove theorem 1 is to derive equations ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) and ([\ref=eq:Tj]).

The simplest way to prove ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) and ([\ref=eq:Tj]) is to differentiate ([\ref=eq:Rj]) over al, l  ≠  j, and then use ([\ref=eq:qjl]), ([\ref=eq:pjl]), which gives

[formula]

[formula]

but ([\ref=eq:qjl]) and ([\ref=eq:pjl]) also imply that

[formula]

and therefore, differentiating ([\ref=eq:Rjl]), we get

[formula]

Applying the last two equations results in the fundamental relation

[formula]

which is equivalent to ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) if we express Rjl in terms of F, Gj, Gl and v. Now, substituting ∂2jlT into the summand of ([\ref=eq:Tj1]) and gathering terms with derivatives of T together, one obtains equation ([\ref=eq:Tj]).

It remains to prove theorem 4, since all the other results are consequences of theorem 1.

We first multiply eq. ([\ref=eq:Pjl]) by ∂jF∂lF, take square of eq. ([\ref=eq:Ajl]) and then compare them, getting

[formula]

[formula]

Then we use eq. ([\ref=eq:Pj]) to express G2j and G2l, after which some terms cancel out and the last equality above becomes eq. ([\ref=eq:TvFjl]) of theorem 4.

To derive eq. ([\ref=eq:Tvjl]), we first write down a direct consequence of ([\ref=eq:Pjl]),

[formula]

then use the square of ([\ref=eq:Ajl]) again, obtaining

[formula]

Applying again eq. ([\ref=eq:Pj]) to eliminate G2j and G2l from the last equation leads to eq. ([\ref=eq:Tvjl]) after cancellation of several terms.

It is clear that the number of such independent equations is two since we used four equations algebraically eliminating two variables - Gj and Gl from them.

Conclusions

All independent lowest order PDE for GUE spectral gap probabilities are explicitly obtained. This gives also an example of explicit integrable hierarchies in terms of isomonodromic "times" - the spectral endpoint variables.

Appendix: PDE for Gaussian matrices from bilinear identities and Virasoro constraints

In [\cite=IR1] from Toda-AKNS system we obtained the following system of three equations for Gaussian one-matrix gap probabilities:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where Un  =  τJn + 1  /  τJn, Wn  =  τJn - 1  /  τJn, and the operators Bk contain partial derivatives w.r.t. the boundary points of the intervals:

[formula]

It can be solved in general. Let [formula], G  =  WB- 1U  -  UB- 1W, G0  =  WB0U  -  UB0W, T  =   ln τJn. We will need the commutation relation:

[formula]

The combination W  ·  () - U  ·  () together with ([\ref=eq:0]) gives

[formula]

or, taking into account vanishing of all the derivatives at infinity,

[formula]

The combination W  ·  () + U  ·  () and the above definitions of new variables lead to

[formula]

Another combination, B- 1W  ·  () + B- 1U  ·  (), results in

[formula]

If we try to use the expression

[formula]

on the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:dF]), we get just eq. ([\ref=eq:FF]) back again and nothing new. One needs to use another expression for the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:dF]):

[formula]

which can be obtained by moving the differentiation operators in B- 1WB0U  -  B- 1UB0W to the left in two possible ways and then matching them and using eq. ([\ref=eq:com]). Then eq. ([\ref=eq:dF]) becomes

[formula]

Luckily, here (B0 + 1)G can also be expressed as B- 1-derivative, using eqs. ([\ref=eq:G]) and ([\ref=eq:com]):

[formula]

so eq. ([\ref=eq:dF]) is a total derivative and its integration gives

[formula]

Finally, substituting eq. ([\ref=eq:G0]) into eq. ([\ref=eq:FF]) and using eqs. ([\ref=eq:0]) and ([\ref=eq:G]), we obtain a single equation for T  =   ln τJn:

[formula]

This is a fourth order PDE as is the "boundary-KP" equation of Adler, Shiota and van Moerbeke [\cite=ASvM],

[formula]

derived from the KP equation. Comparing the eqs. ([\ref=eq:bT]) and ([\ref=eq:bKP]), we obtain a third order equation for T. Using another commutation relation:

[formula]

it can be written as

[formula]

This last equation is a direct multidimensional analog of the well-known Painlevé IV equation for single endpoint Gaussian case [\cite=TW1] [\cite=ASvM]:

[formula]

where r  =  T' and 'prime' means the derivative w.r.t. the endpoint ξ, since for the case of single endpoint it turns into the equation ([\ref=eq:P4]). The last term in the parentheses of eq. ([\ref=eq:Pr]), which has no analog in eq. ([\ref=eq:P4]), turns then to zero.

However, the equation ([\ref=eq:Pr]) is not the only third-order PDE satisfied by T, see the others for the 2-endpoint case in the sections above. Thus, this situation that the gap probabilities for more than one spectral endpoint satisfy several different PDE is very general and applies for both single and coupled ensembles.
