An Energetic Magnetar in HESS J1713-  381/CTB 37B

Introduction

Of the ≈  60 Galactic TeV sources, the majority (43) are identified as either pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) or supernova remnants (SNRs). The PWN class comprises ≈  27 - 30 of these, and it is likely that some of the unclassified sources will also prove to be PWNe. Most pulsars that are responsible for the PWNe detected at X-ray and TeV energies have spin-down power [formula] erg s- 1. In Figure [\ref=hist] we display the distribution of [formula] for rotation-powered pulsars powering TeV nebulae. For reviews of these, see [\citet=car08], [\citet=gal08], [\citet=lem08], [\citet=hes08], [\citet=mat09], & [\citet=kar10]. In the standard model of nonthermal emission from PWNe, the X-rays are synchrotron from relativistic electrons and positrons, while the TeV γ-rays are inverse Compton scattered microwave background and other ambient photons from the same population of relativistic particles [\citep=dej08] [\citep=zha08]. In contrast, there is scant evidence that any of the 17 known magnetars, with periods in the range 2-  12 s, produce X-ray or TeV PWNe. Including both anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), the spin-down power of magnetars is <  1036 erg s- 1, as also plotted in Figure [\ref=hist]. Because of their larger magnetic field strengths and different emission mechanisms from ordinary spin-powered pulsars, it is not predicted that magnetars accelerate particles to TeV energies [\citep=bel07] [\citep=tho08a] [\citep=tho08b], except perhaps in their earliest stage of rapid spin-down [\citep=aro03].

[\citet=hal10a] presented a study of point X-ray sources in two SNRs detected at TeV energies by the HESS array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The first of these, HESS J1713-  381 associated with CTB 37B, was discovered by [\citet=aha06]. Using a Chandra observation, [\citet=aha08a] then found the point X-ray source CXOU J171405.7-  381031 in CTB 37B, and considered that it could be a pulsar, albeit with an unusually soft, non-thermal spectrum. [\citet=nak09] analyzed Chandra and Suzaku spectra of CXOU J171405.7-  381031, noting possible variability in flux, which they took to be good evidence that it is an anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP). In Paper I, we reported the discovery of pulsations from CXOU J171405.7-  381031 that verifies this conjecture. In Section 2 of this paper, we report a follow-up Chandra observation that measures the period derivative of the pulsar, establishing its quantitative magnetar properties. While this paper was in preparation, the same result was announced by [\citet=sat10] using an XMM-Newton observation. We raise in Section 3 the possibility that at an early stage, a magnetar such as the one in CTB 37B may produce a TeV PWN. In Section 4 we report on a new observation of the second compact X-ray source discussed in Paper 1, XMMU J173203.3-  344518 in HESS J1731-  347/G353.6-  0.7, in which pulsations are not confirmed.

X-ray Observations of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 in HESS J1713-  381/CTB 37B

We obtained a new Chandra observation of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 on 2010 January 30 using the same instrumental setup as our previous observation of 2009 January 25 (Paper I). Both data sets were acquired using the Advanced Camera for Imaging and Spectroscopy (ACIS) in continuous-clocking (CC) mode with the pulsar located on the ACIS-S3 CCD. This provides a time resolution of 2.85 ms and avoids any spectral pile-up. The photon arrival times in CC mode are adjusted in the standard processing to account for the known position of the pulsar, spacecraft dither, and SIM offset. Reduction and analysis used the standard software packages CIAO (v4.1) and CALDB (v3.5.0). A log of the Chandra timing observations is given in Table [\ref=logtable].

With a period derivative derived from the Chandra observations (see below), we also searched for and likely detected pulsations in archival data taken with the ASCA X-ray telescope [\citep=tan94]. The pulsar was imaged with the Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS) on 1996 September 12 as part of the Galactic Survey [\citep=sug01]. It fell on the very edge of the GIS field of view of sequence #54002030, 21' from the pointing direction, partially in the area masked out by the standard processing. To maximize the sensitivity to the expected pulsar signal, we combined unmasked and unfiltered data taken in low- and high-bit-rate data modes, with timing resolution of 0.5 s and 0.0625 s, respectively. We obtained a total of 712 counts (0.5-  10 keV) from the source in a 3' radius aperture during 13.3 ks of usable exposure from the 21 ks observation.

Timing Analysis

The photon arrival times were corrected to the solar system barycenter using the pulsar position obtained from the Chandra ACIS-I image. Timing analysis of the Chandra data was then performed in an identical manner to Paper I. Photons from the central four source columns ([formula]) in the range 1-  5 keV, which contains most of the photons, were extracted and searched for pulsations using the Rayleigh test [\citep=str80], also known as Z21 [\citep=buc83]. The power-spectrum and folded pulse profiles from the two Chandra  timing observations are shown in Figure [\ref=pulse]. Although the eye may be drawn to subtle differences, a χ2 test on the difference profile indicates that the two light curves are not significantly different: χ2ν  =  1.44 for 20 degrees of freedom, corresponding to 9% chance probability. The pulsed fraction is fp  ≈  0.38, defined as the fraction of counts above the minimum in the light curve, corrected for background. There is no evidence for energy dependence of the pulse profile. While it is possible that the true period is 7.6 s, with two peaks per rotation, there is no strong evidence to support this in the form of distinguishable peaks in the current data.

The periods and 1σ uncertainties for the two Chandra observations are listed in Table [\ref=logtable], while the period derivative listed in Table [\ref=ephemeris] is calculated from the difference between the periods measured 1 year apart. The uncertainty on [formula] is propagated from the statistical errors in the individual period measurements. The [formula] over the 1 year time span corresponds to a dipole magnetic field strength [formula] G, well into the magnetar range. The spin-down power [formula] erg s- 1 is among the largest for magnetars, and the characteristic age [formula] years is among the smallest.

A third period measurement was obtained by [\citet=sat10] using XMM-Newton, only 47 days after our second Chandra timing observation. They reported P  =  3.825352  ±  0.000004 s on 2010 March 17-  18. As shown in Figure [\ref=timing], this third point requires a significant increase in [formula] to 1.05  ×  10- 10. Such variation is common in magnetars, and in this case may indicate that the spin-down power was recently as large as ≈  7  ×  1034 erg s- 1.

We recovered a fourth period measurement from the archival ASCA observation listed in Table [\ref=logtable] by extrapolating the Chandra ephemeris. This detection shown in Figure [\ref=asca], while not significant in a blind search, has a false detection probability of only 1.1  ×  10- 3 when the search is restricted to a range of [formula] up to twice the Chandra measured value. The implied period derivative relative to the 2009 Chandra measurement is [formula], and the strength of the highly modulated signal is plausible. As shown in Figure [\ref=asca], which includes an extended range of period derivatives up to 10 times the Chandra value, no other significant peak is found. Figure [\ref=timing] shows the average [formula] obtained in an unweighted fit to all four exsiting period measurements, [formula] corresponding to τc  =  860 years, very close to the Chandra measured values, but perhaps a better representation of the long-term average. Keeping in mind that [formula] is evidently variable, the ephemeris in Table [\ref=ephemeris] includes only the two Chandra points, which present the minimum observed value of [formula].

Spectral Analysis

Spectral data for the pulsar were extracted from the Chandra CC-mode observations using the five central source columns, corresponding to a diameter of [formula] and ≈  95% of the point-source energy enclosed. The background for the spectrum was obtained from the regions adjacent to the source. Background subtracted count rates are 0.106  ±  0.002 and 0.122  ±  0.002 s- 1, respectively, for the two observations, indicating a likely change of ≈  15%.

The standard spectral response matrices were generated for the target location on the CCD using the CIAO tool psextract, with care taken to normalize the background according to area. All spectra were corrected for the effects of charge-transfer inefficiency; however, the spectral gain is not calibrated well in CC mode. The resulting spectra were grouped with a minimum of 50 counts per bin and fitted using the XSPEC software [\citet=arn96] to power-law, two blackbody, and Comptonized blackbody models. The spectral fits are shown in Figure [\ref=spectrum], and the best fitted parameters for these models are listed in Table [\ref=spectable]. A single blackbody model does not yield a good fit, and is not shown.

In paper I the ACIS-I/TE mode observation of 2007 indicated a rising spectrum above 6 keV, but the CC-mode spectra presented here do not clearly show that property. We suspect that the previous spectrum may have suffered systematic effects as the pulsar was dithered into the gap between CCDs. In addition, a small amount of spectral pileup in TE mode is avoided in CC mode. Nevertheless, the source is definitely detected up to 10 keV, and shows some evidence for an upturn there in the slightly brighter state of 2010.

Discussion

CXOU J171405.7-  381031 as a Magnetar

The Chandra CC-mode spectra of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 are fitted equally well by power-law, two blackbody, and Comptonized blackbody models. Of these, we disfavor the steep Γ  ≈  4.2 power-law model as being least plausible on physical grounds. In the thermal models, there is a blackbody component of temperature ≈  0.4 keV that covers ≈  10% of the surface area of the neutron star. A harder component is also needed that can be parameterized as either a second blackbody or a power-law tail, the latter approximating what is probably cyclotron resonance scattering [\citep=fer07] using a simplified analytic expression in the Comptonized blackbody model [\citep=hal08]. The hot spot(s), and possibly anisotropic scattering in the magnetosphere, are responsible for the observed pulsations, although there is no obvious dependence of the pulse shape on energy. In either the two blackbody or the Comptonized blackbody model, the associated NH  ≈  4  ×  1022 cm- 2 is compatible with its value in fits to the thermal emission from the SNR [\citep=nak09], which yield NH = 3.5+ 0.5- 0.7  ×  1022 cm- 2. This provides some additional support for the association of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 with CTB 37B.

Other properties of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 are consistent with those of AXPs: a factor of ≈  1.8 flux decrease is reported between the earlier Suzaku and Chandra observations [\citep=nak09]. The spin-down power of CXOU J171405.7-  381031, [formula] erg s- 1, is among the highest for magnetars, exceeded only by SGR/AXP 1E 1547.0-  5408 [\citep=cam07] [\citep=cam08], and equalled by SGR 1627-  41 [\citep=esp09] and SGR 1806-  20 when in its active state, [formula] erg s- 1, although here we adopt a more typical quiescent value of 8  ×  1033 erg s- 1 [\citep=woo07]. The range of [formula] in which CXOU J171405.7-  381031 falls (Figure [\ref=hist]) is occupied by SGRs rather than AXPs. By analogy with the history of 1E 1547.0-  5408 and other high-[formula] magnetars that exhibit large fluctuations in [formula], we speculate that CXOU J171405.7-  381031 is prone to having SGR outbursts. It also shares with 1E 1547.0-  5408 the property that its spin-down power is greater than its X-ray luminosity (Lx  ≈  2  ×  1034 erg s- 1), at least in quiescence. However, this does not change our assessment that the majority of its luminosity is generated by magnetic field decay and not by rotation, given its high surface dipole field strength, Bs  =  4.8  ×  1014 G, X-ray spectral properties, and variability that are typical of magnetars.

Comparison of Age Estimates

At radio wavelengths, CTB 37B is a shell [formula] in diameter [\citep=kas91]. Its distance, estimated from absorption and the Galactic rotation curve, is ≈  8 kpc [\citep=gre09]. Estimates of the age of CTB 37B are quite varied, and it is of great interest to compare these with the spin-down age of CXOU J171405.7-  381031, even though characteristic ages of magnetars are not reliable because their period derivatives are known to vary by a factor of a few.

[\citet=cla75] tentatively associated CTB 37B with the historical supernova of 393 AD, which would make it 1600 years old, almost twice the pulsar's characteristic age of ~  860 years. However, in the same region of the sky the more recently discovered SNR RXJ 1713.7-  3946 is a much better candidate for SN 393, as argued by [\citet=wan97], [\citet=wan06], and [\citet=cas04]. At d  ≈  1.3 kpc and with NH  ≈  5  ×  1021 cm- 2 [\citep=cas04], RXJ 1713.7-  3946 is closer, and an order of magnitude less absorbed than CTB 37B, while the latter is too far away to have been visible for 8 months as the Chinese records indicate. Given this better alternative, we do not regard the birth of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 as having been established by historical records. Instead, we turn to estimates of the SNR age from analyses of its thermal X-ray spectrum.

Using the Chandra data, [\citet=aha08a] fitted a non-equilibrium ionization model and obtained a Sedov age of ≈  4900 yr for CTB 37B assuming electron-ion equilibrium, while noting that this condition is usually not obtained in young SNRs. Both a higher ion temperature and efficient cosmic ray acceleration have the effect of decreasing the inferred age, perhaps to ~  2700 yr in the estimate of [\citet=aha08a]. [\citet=nak09] then analyzed the Suzaku spectrum of CTB 37B and estimated the age of the plasma as 650+ 2500- 300 years in the brightest part of the remnant, which also required a relatively low ISM density of nH  ~  0.4 cm- 3. In addition, they found a region of non-thermal power-law emission and a smaller ambient density in the southern part of the SNR. Thus, the SNR age estimate is broadly consistent with the pulsar's characteristic age, although the uncertainties in both values are large, and their applicability can be questioned.

Magnetar/SNR Associations

Three magnetars are securely associated with shell SNRs because of their central locations: 1E 2259+586 in CTB 109, 1E 1841-  045 in Kes 73, SGR 0526-  66 in the LMC SNR N49 (Gaensler et al. 2001). To these we may tentatively add 1E 1547.0-  5408 because of its possible radio shell G327.24-  0.13 [\citep=gel07], and now CXOU J171405.7-  381031 in CTB 37B. In addition to constraining ages for modelling of PWNe, such associations are valuable for inferring natal properties such as magnetar kick velocity, and possible contribution of an assumed rapidly spinning proto-magnetar to the energetics of the SNR expansion (e.g., Vink & Kuiper 2006). Theories for the birth of magnetars require short initial spin periods, of order a few milliseconds, in order to create their strong B-fields from a turbulent dynamo whose strength depends on the rotation rate of the proto-neutron star [\citep=tho93].

The radio emitting AXP XTE J1810-  197 is the only magnetar with a directly measured proper motion, corresponding to vt  =  212  ±  35 d3.5 km s- 1 [\citep=hel07], a value which is not unusual compared to ordinary young neutron stars. [\citet=aha08a] noted that the displacement of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 from the center of the shell of CTB 37B would require a transverse velocity of ~  1000 km s- 1 for an age of 5000 yr. The velocity would be unreasonably larger if the pulsar characteristic age of ~  1000 years is adopted as its true age. However, [\citet=aha08a] and [\citet=nak09] also noted that the brighter X-ray and radio emission on the eastern side of the remnant (see Figure 1 of Paper I) is probably due to a higher density there, implying that the pulsar may still be close to the explosion center, which is not the geometric center, reducing its inferred velocity.

Because of this non-uniformity in shock radius rs and ISM density ρ0, it is difficult to use the standard Sedov evolution

[formula]

as did [\citet=vin06] for other SNRs hosting magnetars, to estimate the energy E0 of the explosion. The radius, which enters to the fifth power, is uncertain by at least a factor of 2. Nevertheless, if we use the values adopted by [\citet=nak09] for the radius, age, and ambient density in the brightest part of the remnant (their region 1), an unremarkable energy of E0  ~  1  ×  1050 erg results. Energetic input to the SNR expansion from a presumed millisecond magnetar spinning down is therefore not evident, as was also concluded by [\citep=vin06] for other SNRs hosting magnetars.

Can the Magnetar Contribute to TeV Emission?

HESS observations reported in [\citet=aha08a] localized the TeV emission to the center of the radio shell of CTB 37B, and found that the extent of the TeV source is compatible with either a centrally peaked Gaussian of [formula] or a shell of radius [formula]-[formula], consistent with the size of the radio remnant. The energy flux of HESS J1713-  381 from 0.2-10 TeV is ≈  4.2  ×  10- 12 erg cm- 2 s- 1, corresponding to luminosity Lγ  =  3.2  ×  1034 d28 erg s- 1, which we note is almost equal to the spin-down power of CXOU J171405.7-  381031, [formula] erg s- 1. Previous authors have argued that particles accelerated at the SNR shock are responsible for the TeV emission from HESS J1713-  381 via pion decay [\citep=aha08a] or multi-zone inverse Compton scattering of the microwave background [\citep=nak09]. As it is not clear if the TeV source has a pure shell-like morphology, it cannot be ruled out that the pulsar makes some contribution to the TeV flux, possible via inverse Compton scattering from a PWN that is confined within the SNR shell.

Since the TeV luminosity of HESS J1713-  381 is almost equal to the present spin-down power of CXOU J171405.7-  381031, a scenario for a pulsar-powered TeV nebula would necessarily involve particles injected at an earlier time when its spin-down power was larger. However, unlike ordinary pulsars, it is not certain that magnetars can accelerate particles to TeV energies. Magnetar models that involve strong currents on closed, twisted magnetic field lines develop voltages of only ~  109 V [\citep=bel07]. On the other hand, it is not excluded that the ordinary pulsar mechanism operates on open magnetic field lines of magnetars, which may generate particle-dominated winds that become shocked PWNe, accelerating a fraction of the particles to TeV energies. Evidence for this possibility comes from the three magnetars that are also transient radio pulsars [\citep=cam06] [\citep=cam07] [\citep=lev10]. Even so, we caution that models for radio emission from magnetars [\citep=tho08a] [\citep=tho08b] produce average particle energies of only ~  3 GeV even on open field lines, because γ-rays make pairs more easily in the strong magnetic field.

Nevertheless, if high-energy electrons are generated in a shocked PWN in an early stage and escape the high B-field region, they can emit via inverse Compton scattering into the TeV band for an extended time [\citep=dej08]. Electron lifetimes against synchrotron and inverse Compton losses are

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively, for an electron producing a photon of energy Eγ(TeV) by inverse Compton scattering of the microwave background. The limiting lifetime of such a relic nebula is then determined by ts as long as B > 2 μG.

The spin-down power of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 was certainly large enough to generate a TeV PWN during the history of CTB 37B, as long as it was born with a period significantly shorter than its present value, since [formula] erg s- 1. The current TeV luminosity of HESS J1713-  381, ≈  3.2  ×  1034 erg s- 1, if radiated for 1000 yr, amounts to ~  1  ×  1045 erg, which is <  10- 3 of the initial rotational energy of the pulsar for P0  <  0.14 s. Thus, we consider an inverse Compton PWN to be a plausible channel for TeV emission from CXOU J171405.7-  381031 because it requires only a small fraction of the rotational energy to be deposited in very high-energy electrons.

A possible prototype of such systems is PSR J1846-  0258, the "transitional" ~  700 yr old pulsar [\citep=got00] associated with HESS J1846-  029 in the shell-like SNR Kes 75 [\citep=dja08]. This 0.32 s pulsar has a dipole field that approaches magnetar strength (Bs  =  4.9  ×  1013 G) and displays AXP-like bursts (Gavriil et al. 2008); it is therefore likely of an intermediate class connecting the rotation-powered and the magnetar pulsars. It is also one of the most energetic pulsars; its [formula] erg s- 1 is easily sufficient to power its X-ray PWN and the compact TeV emission of HESS J1846-  029 [\citep=dja08]. However, Kes 75 differs from CTB 37B in that it contains a powerful X-ray PWN, while there is no evidence of an X-ray PWN in CTB 37B. Although these SNRs are of comparable age, any X-ray PWN in CTB 37B may have evolved a factor of 10 faster than the one in Kes 75, based on the scaling of pulsar [formula] with true age T such that [formula] for a given [formula]. The lifetime of a hypothetical rotation-powered X-ray PWN around a magnetar must be relatively brief. Interestingly, [\citet=vin10] claim to have detected the first X-ray PWN around a magnetar in an archival Chandra observation of 1E 1547.0-  5408, the magnetar of highest [formula]. Although this would be an important precedent, we hesitate to interpret it as such because we have not clearly confirmed its existence in those data.

Evidence to associate any other magnetar with TeV emission is sparse. The AXP 1E 1841-  045 in SNR Kes 73 is located at the edge of HESS J1841-  055 [\citep=aha08b], but this is not a likely association because the TeV emission is [formula] in diameter and may conceivably have more than one source, as considered by [\citet=sgu09]. Moreover, it can be expected that any high-energy particles are still contained within the SNR shell, which is much smaller than the TeV source. Recently, an extended TeV source that surrounds the massive, young star cluster Westerlund 1 has also been reported by HESS [\citep=ohm09]. It is possible that this source is associated with a young pulsar born in the cluster, the transient AXP CXO J164710.2-  455216 [\citep=mun06], or its supernova remnant. Notably absent among the reported HESS sources is 1E 1547.0-  5408, the magnetar of highest [formula] and a small characteristic age similar to CXOU J171405.7-  381031. It would be interesting to target 1E 1547.0-  5408 for a deep observation by HESS as a second test of whether a young magnetar can produce a TeV source.

X-ray Timing Observation of XMMU J173203.3-  344518 in HESS J1731-  347

In Paper I, we also presented an analysis of the point source XMMU J173203.3-  344518 in the SNR G353.6-  0.7 that has been identified with the TeV source HESS J1731-  347 [\citep=aha08b] [\citep=tia08]. We found only marginal evidence for a 1 s period in an XMM-Newton observation, which, in combination with the absence of strong evidence for variability did not allow us to definitively classify XMMU J173203.3-  344518. Both a magnetar and a weakly magnetized central compact object (CCO) remained possibilities. The spectrum of XMMU J173203.3-  344518 was best fitted by a two blackbody model, which is common to members of both classes.

We obtained a new Chandra observation of XMMU J173203.3-  344518 on 2010 May 18 using ACIS-S in CC-mode for 40 ks. Using the same analysis techniques as described in Section 2 for CC-mode data, our period search of XMMU J173203.3-  344518 did not reveal the candidate signal at 1 s, nor any other significant period. The 95% confidence upper limit on the pulsed fraction of a sinusoidal signal is 8.6% for any period down to 10 ms. If restricted to periods [formula] s, the corresponding limit is 7.6%. We also performed searches in restricted energy bands, in case there is a pulsation with an energy-dependent phase reversal similar to PSR J0821-  4300 in Puppis A [\citep=got09], but no such signal was found.

We fitted the spectrum to a two blackbody model, which was the best fitting model to previous observations of XMMU J173203.3-  344518 in Paper I. The result in shown in Figure [\ref=spectrum2]; the data is grouped with 100 counts per bin. Table [\ref=spectable2] gives the parameters of the two blackbody fit. These are consistent with the previous observations; in particular, the 0.5-  10 keV flux is identical to that of an XMM-Newton observation from the year 2007 (Paper I). The absence of variability and pulsations tends to favor a CCO; several of the latter have very low limits on pulsed fraction [\citep=hal10b]. If so, XMMU J173203.3-  344518 would be the most luminous CCO, with Lx  ≈  1  ×  1034 erg s- 1. Recently, HESS was able to resolve the TeV emission of HESS J1731-  347 into a shell that matches the size of the radio remnant G353.6-  0.7 [\citep=ace09]. This would tend to rule out the central source XMMU J173203.3-  344518 as a source of the TeV emission.

Conclusions

In Paper I, we reported the discovery of the 3.82 s pulsar CXOU J171405.7-  381031 in CTB 37B, which is coincident with the TeV source HESS J1713-  381. Additional X-ray timing measurements reported here for the first time reveal the spin-down rate. CXOU J171405.7-  381031 is one of the most energetic magnetars in terms of spin-down power, and has a characteristic timing age of ~  1000 years or less. Its timing age is roughly consistent with other estimates of the age of the SNR. In addition, there is some evidence for long-term variability by a factor of ~  2 in spin-down rate, which recently is found at its highest measured value. Its [formula] falls in the range occupied by SGRs, which may portend a future SGR outburst. The off-center location of the pulsar inside the SNR shell is probably a result of the inhomogeneous medium in which the shell expanded, rather than indicating an unprecedented high natal kick velocity.

There are considerable theoretical obstacles to getting particles of TeV energy from a magnetar, as well as having them emit primarily TeV γ-rays. As well, there is little observational evidence for such particles in the form of an X-ray synchrotron nebula. Nevertheless, the exceptional youth and high [formula] of CXOU J171405.7-  381031 lead us to entertain the possibility that it generated a relic PWN that is now emitting primarily via inverse Compton scattering at TeV energies. Future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov observations to try to resolve the shell of CTB 37B from the pulsar could test this hypothesis.

Turning to another compact source in a HESS SNR, we obtained a second X-ray timing observation of XMMU J173203.3-  344518 in HESS J1731-  347/G353.6-  0.7, but did not succeed in discovering a period. Its nature remains ambiguous because its composite spectrum, best fitted with two blackbodies, is characteristic of either AXPs or CCOs. In comparison with three previous X-ray observations of this source, the absence of obvious variability so far is consistent with XMMU J173203.3-  344518 being a CCO (anti-magnetar). Deeper observations will be necessary to discover its timing properties, which would determine conclusively whether it is a magnetar or an anti-magnetar. The present upper limit on pulsed fraction is comparable to the weakest pulsations observed in magnetars including, at times, 1E 1547.0-  5408 [\citep=hal08], and similar to the upper limits on several CCOs [\citep=hal10b] for which pulsations have not been detected. Even if pulsations are absent, continuing monitoring of XMMU J173203.3-  344518  for variability may also resolve its nature, since only a magnetar would be variable.
