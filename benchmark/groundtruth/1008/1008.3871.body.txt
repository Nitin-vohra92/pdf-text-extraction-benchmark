Symmetry and uniqueness of minimizers of Hartree type equations with external Coulomb potential

Introduction

Solitary waves associated with the Hartree type equation in external Coulomb potential are solutions of type

[formula]

where ω > 0 and χ satisfies the nonlinear elliptic equation

[formula]

The natural energy functional associated with this problem is (see [\cite=CL1])

[formula]

where we shall denote

[formula]

The corresponding minimization problem is associated with the quantity

[formula]

The existence of positive minimizers χ0(x), such that

[formula]

is established by Cazenave and Lions in [\cite=CL1] by the aid of the concentration compactness method.

For a given ω > 0, the constrained minimization problem [\eqref=defImu] can be compared with the unconstrained minimization problem

[formula]

where Sω(χ) is the corresponding action functional, defined by

[formula]

There are different results on the symmetry (and uniqueness) of the minimizers. The basic result due to Gidas, Ni and Nirenberg [\cite=GNN] implies the radial symmetry of the minimizers associated with the semilinear elliptic equation

[formula]

provided suitable assumptions on the function f(u) are satisfied and the scalar function u is positive. As in the previous result due to Serrin [\cite=S], the proof is based on the maximum principle and the Hopf's lemma.

Therefore, the first natural question is to ask if the linear operator

[formula]

in [\eqref=eq.M-S1], satisfies the weak maximum principle in the sense that

[formula]

The above maximum principle is incomplete, since additional behavior of u and g at infinity has to be imposed, namely, we shall suppose that

[formula]

for some real number M  >  0.

Note, that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are described by the eigenvalues ωk  >  0 of the eigenvalue problem

[formula]

One has

[formula]

and e0(x)  =  ce- |x| / 2,c > 0. The first observation is that all eigenfunctions ek(x), k  ≥  1, are expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials of |x|, having exactly k roots. This fact guarantees that the maximum principle is not valid for ω  =  ωk. More precisely, we can show the following.

The weak maximum principle [\eqref=eq.MPr] is valid if an only if

[formula]

This result can be compared with the existence of action minimizers for the corresponding functional Sω, obtained by Lions for 0  <  ω  <  1 / 4 (see for details [\cite=PL]).

We have the properties:

a) for any ω  >  0, the inequality

[formula]

holds;

b) if 0  <  ω  <  1 / 4, then Sminω < 0;

c) if 0  <  ω  <  1 / 4, then there exists a positive function χ(x)∈H1, such that

[formula]

Our main goal of this paper is to clarify if the positive minimizers of Sω are radially symmetric and unique. The above results show that we have to consider the domain 0  <  ω  <  1 / 4, where the key tool of Gidas, Ni and Nirenberg (i.e. the maximum principle for the corresponding linear operator) is not applicable.

The symmetry of the energy functional (even with constraint conditions) can not imply, in general, the radial symmetry of the minimizers. This phenomena was discovered and studied in the works [\cite=CZE], [\cite=E1] and [\cite=E2] in the scalar case.

Some sufficient conditions that guarantee the symmetry of minimizers have been studied by Lopes in [\cite=L], by means of the reflection method that (for the case of plane x1 = 0) uses the functions and

If the functional to be minimized has the form

[formula]

then we have the relation

[formula]

and this enables one to obtain the symmetry of minimizer, when F(u) is a combination of functions of type |u|p,p  ≥  2.

The reflection method works effectively when u(x) is a vector-valued function and constraint conditions (as in the problem [\eqref=defImu]) are involved too.

Recently, the reflection method was generalized in [\cite=LM] and [\cite=M] for very general situations and one example of possible application is the functional of type

[formula]

involving nonlocal term as in [\eqref=eq.defEps]. This Choquard type functional has the specific property

[formula]

exploiting the negative sign of the nonlocal term A(|u|2).

An analogous result for the scalar case can be obtained by means of the Schwarz symmetrization (or spherical decreasing rearrangement [\cite=LL]) u*(|x|) of the non-negative u∈H1. Indeed, we have the equality

[formula]

as well as the inequalities

[formula]

so, we get

[formula]

and one can use the property that u is minimizer.

The functional in [\eqref=eq.defEps] is a typical example, when reflection method and Schwarz symmetrization meet essential difficulty to be applied directly.

The main goal of this work is to find an approach to establish the symmetry of the minimizer for functionals of Hartree type [\eqref=eq.defEps], involving nonlocal terms with "bad" sign.

To state this main result, we shall try first to connect the minimizers of the constraint problem [\eqref=defImu] (associated with the energy functional E(χ)) with the minimization of the action functional Sω(χ). Similar relation for local type interactions is discussed in chapter IX of [\cite=Caz]. Then, we shall establish that the minimizer of Theorem [\ref=th:actmin] is a radially symmetric function.

The solution χ(x) from Theorem [\ref=th:actmin] is a radially symmetric function for

[formula]

As it was mentioned above the energy (and therefore the action) is a functional involving the nonlocal term with "bad" sign. To explain the main idea to treat this case, we recall the rotational symmetry of the energy (and action) functional. Therefore, if χ is the action minimizer from Theorem [\ref=th:actmin], it is sufficient to show that the solution is symmetric with respect to x1-plane, for any choice of the x1-direction. In other words, we consider (x) = χ(x̂), with x̂ = ( - x1,x2,x3) and we aim to prove that χ  =  .

To show this, we shall consider the two terms

[formula]

So, our goal is to verify the inequality

[formula]

and see that the condition χ  ≠   implies Sω(χ-) > 0.

The form of the functional Sω suggests one, in order to verify [\eqref=eq.mCl23], to use an appropriate version of the Clarkson inequality for the quadratic form A(f). Namely, we can prove that the following inequality

[formula]

holds true. Unfortunately, the usual Clarkson inequality in the form given above, is too rough to serve as a tool for proving [\eqref=eq.mCl23]. Therefore, we shall use a refined version of Clarkson inequality (see Lemma [\ref=Clarkson] below) in the form

[formula]

The final step is to treat the uniqueness of positive minimizers. of the problem

[formula]

Our proof can not follow the Lieb's uniqueness proof for the ground state solution of the Choquard equation [\cite=Lie]. In general, the Lieb's proof strongly depends on the specific features of the nonlocal nonlinear equation [\eqref=eq.M-S1] and differs from the corresponding results for semilinear elliptic equation given by Kwong in [\cite=Kw]. Indeed, once the radial symmetry is established, one can use Pohozaev identities and reduce the nonlocal nonlinear elliptic problem [\eqref=eq.M-S1] to an ordinary differential equation of the type

[formula]

where

[formula]

The positive sign in front of the nonlinear term is the main obstacle to apply Sturm type argument and derive the uniqueness of positive solutions to this ordinary differential equation. However, for [formula] we can apply the approach based on the refined Clarkson inequality and using the orthogonal projection on the eigenspace of the first eigenvalue of the operator Δ + 1 / |x|, we can establish the following result.

Let [formula]. Then, the solution χ of minimization problems [\eqref=uniq.act-mini] is unique.

Let's mention that the results in Theorems [\ref=th:actsym] and [\ref=th:unique] can be compared with the results in [\cite=BS], where the uniqueness of minimizers for the constrained variational problem [\eqref=defImu] is studied. To show the relations between action minimization and [\eqref=defImu] one has to apply the uniqueness of action minimizers or alternatively the uniqueness of minimizers of constrained variational problem.

The plan of the work is the following. In Section 2 we consider the maximum principle for the linear Schrödinger equation with Coulomb potential and prove Lemma [\ref=lem.weakMP]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=th:actsym], stating that the minimizers are radially symmetric is presented in Section 3 by the aid of a refined version of Clarkson inequality. In Section 4 we establish the Pohozaev integral relations, corresponding to equation [\eqref=eq.M-S1], and in Section 5 we prove uniqueness Theorem [\ref=th:unique]. Finally, in [\ref=app.A] we prove for completeness the existence of positive action minimizers, stated in Theorem [\ref=th:actmin], while in [\ref=app.C] the connection between energy and action minimizers is discussed.

The authors are grateful to Louis Jeanjean for important discussions and remarks on symmetry of minimizers as well as to the referee for pointing out a gap in the proof of the Theorem 3.

Maximum principle for Schrödinger equation with Coulomb potential

The maximum principle, stated in [\eqref=eq.MPr] will be verified by the aid of the substitution

[formula]

where φ is a radial function, satisfying the property

[formula]

Our goal is to construct φ, so that φ(|x|)  >  0. We have several possibilities, depending on ω. If ω  >  1 / 4, we shall show that such a function exists and it is of type

[formula]

If ω  =  1 / 4, then we can take simply φ(r)  =  e-  r / 2. If 0  <  ω  <  1 / 4, we shall see that a function φ of type [\eqref=eq.typ] exists, but φ(r) changes the sign for r > 0. Hence, this function gives a counterexample, showing that the weak maximum principle [\eqref=eq.MPr] is not fulfilled in this case.

Therefore, to complete the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem.weakMP], we have to explain how the existence of positive φ(r), satisfying [\eqref=eq.posf] will imply the weak maximum principle and then to construct in different cases the function Q(r) in [\eqref=eq.typ], so that [\eqref=eq.posf] is satisfied.

Radial symmetry of action minimizers

Even in the non-local case, the problem that action and energy minimizers are nonnegative functions, is easy to be proved. Indeed, if χ(x)∈H1 is a real-valued minimizer of the functional

[formula]

then |χ(x)| satisfies the inequality

[formula]

as well as the identities

[formula]

so |χ(x)|  ≥  0 is also a minimizer of Sω.

Let us define the bilinear form

[formula]

and the corresponding quadratic form

[formula]

The quadratic form A(χ) defined in [\eqref=eq.dAa] generates the corresponding bilinear form

[formula]

Then, the action functional Sω can be written as

[formula]

Also, for any function χ we shall denote (x) = χ(x̂), where x̂ = ( - x1,x2,x3) for any choice of our x1-axis. It is easy to check that

[formula]

With our next result, we shall establish Clarkson type inequalities for the forms A and Lω. In fact, we shall prove the Lemma.

The following inequalities hold

[formula]

[formula]

The next result will play the crucial role in the present study. We shall prove the following Lemma.

If Lω(f)  =  Lω(g) and μ,ν  ≥  0 satisfy 2(μ2  +  ν2) = 1, then

[formula]

If A(f2)  =  A(g2) and μ,ν  ≥  0 satisfy 2(μ2  +  ν2) = 1, then we have

[formula]

Turning back to the minimization problem of the action functional Sω, we observe the following fact. If χ(x) is a minimizer of the problem

[formula]

then (x) and -  (x) are also minimizers of Sω(χ). Moreover, we have the property.

Assume that χ(x) is a minimizer of the problem [\eqref=act-inf] and one of the following alternatives:

Lω(χ  -  )  ≥  0;

Lω(χ  +  )  ≥  0

holds. Then χ  =  .

Now, we are ready to prove the radial symmetry of the action minimizer, stated in Theorem [\ref=th:actsym].

Pohozaev identities

In this part we shall establish the so-called Pohozaev identities for [\eqref=eq.M-S1]. More precisely, we shall prove the following

If [formula] and satisfies [\eqref=eq.M-S1] in [formula], then the following identities hold

[formula]

[formula]

The Pohozaev identities are useful to treat the uniqueness of the minimizers (modulo multiplication by complex constant z with |z| = 1). Indeed, let χ1 and χ2 are minimizers of the problem

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we can apply the Pohozaev identities of Lemma [\ref=Pohoz]. In this way we find

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Lω(χ) is defined according to [\eqref=eq.L-quadr].

Uniqueness of minimizers

In this section we shall prove the uniqueness result of Theorem [\ref=th:unique]. The classical approach for proving the uniqueness of minimizers is to reduce the initial nonlinear equation to an ordinary differential equation, using the radial symmetry. Uniqueness of positive ground state solutions for nonlinear Schrödinger equation on [formula] with local nonlinearities of the form |u|pu for [formula], is a well-known fact, due to Kwong [\cite=Kw]. The proof in this case relies on Sturm comparison theorems, but it cannot be applied directly to nonlocal equations, such as [\eqref=eq.M-S1]. For the attractive Choquard equation, Lieb in [\cite=Lie] prove uniqueness of energy minimizer by using Newton's theorem for radial function f(x) = f(|x|), that is

[formula]

.

The repulsive sign of the Hartree term in [\eqref=eq.M-S1] is again the main obstacle for applying directly the standard technique.

Existence of action minimizers

The existence of action minimizers for Hartree type equation is already established in [\cite=PL]. For completeness, we shall sketch the proof.

To show the boundedness from below of Sω, we shall prove the following inequalities involving homogeneous Sobolev norms

[formula]

For any p1∈[3,6] and p2∈[2,3] we have the estimates

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

After this Lemma we can show that the action functional is bounded from below.

For any ω  >  0 the inequality

[formula]

holds. For 0  <  ω  <  1 / 4 we have Sminω < 0.

Connection between the action and energy minimization problems

Consider the minimization problem

[formula]

associated with the action functional Sω(χ) and the Lions-Cazenave minimization problem

[formula]

As we have seen before, for every ω∈(1 / 16,1 / 4), there exists (at most one) solution [formula], which is positive and radially symmetric, and such that

[formula]

Let us denote

[formula]

The above definition of the function N(ω) poses the question if

[formula]

For completeness, in this section we shall prove the following Lemma.

If χ1 is a solution of [\eqref=enrg-min] with N = N(ω), then χ1 satisfies the equation

[formula]

and

[formula]
