QUATERNIONIC FORMULATION OF THE DIRAC EQUATION

General introduction

The concept of searching for small remnant Lorentz- and CPT-violation was initially motivated in low energy limits of string theory, but has since branched out to include much more general underlying theories of Nature [\cite=kps]. Specific coefficients to parameterize the theory were proposed and were later generalized slightly to allow for terms violating the gauge invariance of the Standard Model [\cite=ck]. The resulting Dirac equation is modified due to the presence of the constant background vector and tensor fields. The first general expression for the covariant dispersion relation involving all of the coefficients at the same time was initially found using the determinant of a [formula] matrix operator [\cite=ralph1]. The full expression is rather unwieldy as it leads to a fourth-order polynomial in the energy and momentum variables. In this work, we use quaternions to reduce the full 4  ×  4 matrix Dirac operator to 2  ×  2 form. The mathematical properties of the quaternions are then used to obtain the dispersion relation in a more tractable form [\cite=cmm].

Some introduction to quaternions

The quaternions are generated by four basis elements denoted 1,î,,, with multiplicative properties

and cyclic permutations. The quaternions are particularly interesting since they satisfy the axioms for a mathematical skew field. A field is an algebraic structure with notions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division satisfying various properties, the key of which is that there are no nontrivial zero divisors. The real numbers provide the simplest example with one dimension, they are commutative, and have a natural ordering. The complex numbers are a two-dimensional example, but they lose the natural ordering property that the real numbers have. The quaternions are a four-dimensional field, but they are noncommutative. Octonions are an eight-dimensional generalization, but there associativity is also lost making them particularly cumbersome to deal with. Frobenius presented a famous theorem in 1877 that proves the real, complex, and quaternionic numbers are in fact the only finite dimensional, associative division algebras.

The quaternions may be represented using the Pauli sigma matrices as

[formula]

This furnishes an explicit 2  ×  2 representation for the quaternions as

[formula]

The name pure imaginary quaternion is given to a quaternion of the form   =  q1î  +  q2  +  q3 where the pure real piece vanishes. Pure imaginary quaternions satisfy the following useful relations:

[formula],

â  -  â  =   - 2,

[formula],

where [formula] indicates the quaternion that results after applying the conventional cross product.

Another useful interpretation of the unit quaternions involves their action as generators of rotations. If q  =   cos (θ  /  2)  -   sin (θ  /  2), then [formula] where [formula] is the quaternion corresponding to the vector â rotated by an angle θ about [formula]. The perpendicular and parallel components of â are defined with respect to [formula]. Such an interpretation makes quaternions useful in areas such as 3D gaming and spacecraft attitude controls.

Quaternionic form of the Dirac equation

The gamma matrices in the Dirac representation take the convenient block form

[formula]

Using quaternions, the conventional free Dirac equation can be expressed as

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a pure imaginary quaternion. The lower row gives the spinor solution as

[formula]

and the upper row then reproduces the dispersion relation

[formula]

Note that φ and χ are two-component complex spinors that serve as a module on which the quaternions act. This is in contrast to other approaches to using quaternionic valued wave functions as has been attempted several times in the literature. [\cite=quatdirac].

Quaternionic form of the perturbed Dirac equation

The Dirac equation with Lorentz violation takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The coefficients aμ, bμ, etc... are Lorentz-violating constant background fields.

Some field redefinitions can be used to simplify the model[\cite=cmcd]. The first [\cite=lehnert] is to fix Γ0  →  γ0 using the transformation ψ  =  Aχ, A  =  (γ0Γ0)- 1 / 2. This makes the hamiltonian hermitian and is often a necessary first step in properly interpreting the Lorentz-violating physical effects of any given experiment. The second involves a linear transformation on the momentum and mass space to remove aμ, [formula], and eμ terms

[formula]

Since the transformation is linear, it is simple to invert at the end of the calculation. To avoid cumbersome notation, the primes are dropped in the rest of the calculations. Finally, the fμ term can be removed using a more complicated redefinition [\cite=altschul].

The perturbed Dirac equation can then be put into quaternionic form

[formula]

The parameters in the Dirac operator with hats are pure imaginary quaternions, while the unhatted objects are real. Their relation to the original Lorentz-violating coefficients are given by

[formula]

with the notation

[formula]

Substituting the first row equation of Eq. [\eqref=dirac2.2] into the second row yields

[formula]

where x  =  p0  -  m, y  =  p0  +  m, and r = x2 - ||2. This equation reduces to the form

[formula]

where q1 is real and 2 is a pure-imaginary quaternion. This equation yields the dispersion relation from the eigenvalue condition |22|  =  q21. A fourth-order polynomial in the energy p0 results in the form

[formula]

The linear term β1 vanishes for special parameter choices leading to a simple factorization of the dispersion relation.

Case 1 involves setting   =  ,  = 0. This is equivalent to setting   =  p  =  Ĥ  =  Ĝ  =  0, while leaving the other parameters arbitrary. The resulting dispersion relation takes the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Case 2 involves setting   =    -  , α0  =  0. This is equivalent to setting   =  ĝ  =  b0  =  1  =  0, while leaving the other parameters arbitrary. The resulting dispersion relation takes the form

[formula]

where
