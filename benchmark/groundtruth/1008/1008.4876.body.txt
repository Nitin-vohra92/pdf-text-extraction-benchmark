Spontaneous symmetry breaking and collapse in bosonic Josephson junctions

In many experiments atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are cigar-shaped due to a strong harmonic trapping potential in the cylindric radial plane; these BECs can be separated in two parts by means of a double-well potential in the cylindric axial direction [\cite=oliver]. This kind of geometry is the ideal setup to study the Josephson effect, a macroscopic coherent phenomenon which has been observed in systems as diverse as superconductors [\cite=book-barone], superfluid Helium [\cite=helium] and, recently, also BECs in trapped ultracold atomic gases [\cite=exp-bec]. The observed coherent dynamics of the atomic BEC in the double-well potential (bosonic Josephson junction) [\cite=oliver] [\cite=exp-bec] is efficiently described by nonlinear Josephson equations (JEs) [\cite=smerzi], which are based on a two-mode approximation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [\cite=leggett]. These JEs are fully symmetric by changing the sign of the inter-atomic scattering length and do not predict the collapse of the BEC. The collapse of an attractive BEC of 7Li atoms or 85Rb atoms has been observed by various experimental groups [\cite=col-exp] and theoretically analyzed by many authors: in a single-well potential [\cite=col-single], in a potential without axial confinement [\cite=col-soliton], in a toroidal confinement [\cite=col-torus], in a double-well potential [\cite=col-double], and in a periodic potential [\cite=col-periodic].

In this paper, by correctly taking into account the dimensional reduction of GPE from 3D to 1D, i.e. by using the so-called 1D nonpolynomial Schrödinger equation (1D NPSE) [\cite=salasnich], we show that for an attractive BEC (negative inter-atomic scattering length) the JEs are not reliable in the presence of strong coupling. By numerically solving the 1D NPSE we obtain, for the first time, a quantum phase diagram of the three relevant regimes of the attractive BEC in a double-well: the Josephson phase, where the metastable state of lowest finite energy has a balanced population [\cite=book-barone], the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase, where the metastable state has an unbalanced population [\cite=oliver] [\cite=smerzi], and the phase of collapse, where the system reaches the collapsed ground-state with energy equal to minus infinity. Note that the problem of BEC collapse in an axial double well potential has been investigated by Sakellari, Proukakis, and Adams [\cite=col-double], but they have not derived the quantum phase diagram of the attractive BEC. Instead, very recently the collapse region in a quantum phase diagram has been obtained for a pair of cigar-shaped traps coupled by tunneling of atoms [\cite=io-e-boris]. We also study the coherent dynamics of the system and calculate the frequency of the population imbalance both in the Josephson regime and in the SSB regime. In the SSB phase this frequency reaches its maximum value at the coupling strength where there is the collapse of the BEC. In addition, from the 1D NPSE we obtain generalized Josephson equations, which we call nonpolynomial Josephson equations (NPJEs) for the fractional imbalance and relative phase of the bosonic Josephson junction. These new NPJEs reduce to the familiar JEs in the weak-coupling limit, but show a better agreement with the numerical results of the 1D NPSE (and 3D GPE) for strong couplings (for both positive and negative scattering length). Finally, we suggest that our predictions can be observed experimentally by using an ultracold vapor of 7Li atoms and tuning the s-wave scattering length.

Let us consider a dilute interacting BEC at zero temperature confined by a trapping potential [formula]. This potential is taken to be the superposition of an isotropic harmonic confinement in the the transverse radial plane and a double-well potential VDW(x) in the axial direction x. Then, [formula] is given by

[formula]

where ρ is the cylindric radial coordinate, m is the mass of the atom, and [formula] is the trapping frequency in the radial plane. The macroscopic wave function [formula] describing the above system with N atoms is governed by the 3D GPE

[formula]

where as the s-wave boson-boson scattering length and [formula] is normalized to 1. The 3D GPE captures the main properties of collapse threshold and, as shown by using a reliable nonlocal potential, the collapsed state is actually a state of very high density which decays due to inelastic two- and three-body collisions [\cite=salasnich-old]. By following Ref. [\cite=salasnich], we choose the wave function [formula] as the product of an axial complex wave function f(x,t) and a Gaussian transverse wave function of radial width σ, where σ depends on the axial wave function f(x,t), i.e. σ  =  σ(f(x,t)). By expressing lengths in units of [formula], times in units of [formula], and energies in units of [formula], it is easy to show that the fields f(x,t) and σ(x,t) satisfy the following equations [\cite=salasnich]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] and f(x,t) is normalized to 1. Inserting Eq. ([\ref=el1b]) into Eq. ([\ref=el1]) one gets the so-called 1D NPSE [\cite=salasnich], which is extremely accurate in reproducing the properties of the full 3D GPE with transverse harmonic confinement [\cite=salasnich].

We have solved the 1D NPSE by using a finite-difference Crank-Nicolson code with imaginary time [\cite=salasnich2] [\cite=sala-numerics] to obtain the ground-state of BEC in the symmetric double-well trap. In the numerical analysis the double-well potential VDW(x) is given by the combination of two Pöschl-Teller potentials with the energy barrier of height [formula] and the local minima at [formula] and [formula] (for details see Refs. [\cite=mazza] [\cite=mazza2]). It is important to stress that with Γ < 0 the ground-state is always the collapsed state with energy equal to minus infinity. Thus, for Γ < 0 we are actually looking for the metastable state of lowest finite energy. We find that this metastable state is symmetric for ΓSSB  <  Γ  <  0 (Josephson phase), it has a broken symmetry for ΓC  <  Γ  <  ΓSSB (SSB phase), and it becomes the collapsed ground-state for Γ  <  ΓC (collapsed phase). In Fig. [\ref=fig1] we plot the axial probability density |f(x)|2 of the metastable state obtained by solving the 1D NPSE with imaginary time. We start with a slightly asymmetric initial condition and proceed up to the convergence to a stable configuration. The figure shows that for Γ  =   - 0.2 the profile of the (meta-)stable state is symmetric, while for Γ  =   - 0.3 it is not. For Γ  =   - 0.8 the BEC is practically localized only in the right well. In addition, we find that for Γ  <   - 1.2 there is the collapse.

It is very interesting to analyze the quantum phases of the attractive BEC as a function of the height U0 of the energy barrier. We have performed a systematic investigation by changing both U0 and Γ. The results are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2] where we plot the quantum phase diagram in the plane (U0,|Γ|). To our knowledge, this is the first time that this kind of phase diagram is obtained for an attractive BEC in a symmetric double-well potential. In the figure, the solid lines are obtained from the 1D NPSE, Eqs. ([\ref=el1]) and ([\ref=el1b]). The interaction strength |ΓSSB| of the SSB transition strongly decreases by increasing the height U0 of the energy barrier, while the critical stregth |ΓC| to get the collapse slightly decreases by increasing U0. To check the accuracy of the NPSE we have also solved the 3D GPE, Eq. ([\ref=3dgpe]), by using a cylindric-symmetry finite-difference Crank-Nicolson code with imaginary time [\cite=sala-numerics]. In Fig. [\ref=fig2] the collapse points predicted by 3D GPE are shown as filled circles, while the SSB points of 3D GPE are filled squares. As expected [\cite=salasnich], the agreement between 1D NPSE and 3D GPE is quite good. We stress, however, that both 3D GPE and 1D NPSE are based on a zero-range inter-atomic potential [\cite=leggett] [\cite=salasnich]. A more accurate description of interaction might lead to a slightly different transition between the SSB and the collapse phase in Fig. [\ref=fig2].

Let us now consider this two-mode approximation of the 1D NPSE. Under the condition that the central barrier U0 of the double-well potential VDW(x) is sufficiently high - corresponding to a weak link between its left ad right sides - the field f(x,t) can be decomposed by using the two-mode approximation

[formula]

The functions φL(x) and φR(x), which are orthonormal, are localized in the left and right well, respectively. We assume that the above functions are real and use the ansatz ([\ref=twomode]) in the NPSE. We multiply the resulting equation by φα(x) (α = L,R), and integrate over x. Then, by taking into account the overlaps between φα's localized in the same well and neglecting those ones between φα's localized in different wells, we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

where the parameters ε, K and g are given by

[formula]

Finally, we write the time-dependent amplitudes fα(t) as [formula], with Nα(t) being the fraction of bosons in the α-th well and θα(t) the corresponding phase. Then, Eqs. ([\ref=el2]) and ([\ref=el2b]) give rise to the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the fractional imbalance z(t) = NL(t) - NR(t) (here NL(t) + NR(t) = 1) and the relative phase θ(t) = θR(t) - θL(t):

[formula]

[formula]

We call these equations "nonpolynomial Josephson equations" (NPJEs) because they are derived from the NPSE. NPJEs describe the dynamics of the fractional imbalance z(t) and relative phase θ(t) of the bosonic Josephson junction taking into account transverse-size effects. It is clearly much easier to solve numerically these NPJEs than the full 3D GPE or the 1D NPSE. When the coupling strength g is much smaller than one our NPJEs become

[formula]

which are the familiar Josephson equations (JEs) for a BEC found in Ref. [\cite=smerzi]. It is straightforward to verify that Eqs. ([\ref=evolution3]) and ([\ref=evolution3b]) are invariant under the transformations Γ  →    -  Γ and θ  →    -  θ  +  π. Instead, Eqs. ([\ref=evolution1]) and ([\ref=evolution1b]) do not exhibit this invariance.

The stationary Josephson regime corresponds to the equilibrium points with z = 0 and θ = 0 (balanced population). Both JEs and NPJEs show that this stationary Josephson phase exists only for ΓSSB  <  Γ, where ΓSSB < 0. We have verified that the value of ΓSSB predicted by JEs is always very close to the value obtained with NPJEs. The points below ΓSSB correspond to SSB phase. This phase, according to the JEs, exists for any ΓSSB  <  Γ; while, according to the NPJEs, the SSB phase does not exist anymore at the collapse strength ΓC. Thus NPJEs predict a collapsed phase while JEs do not.

To compare NPJEs with JEs we plot in Fig. [\ref=fig3] the population imbalance z(t) for three values of Γ, choosing as initial conditions z(0) = 0.2 and θ(0) = 0. The figure shows that the NPJE curves (dashed lines) are always closer to the NPSE results (solid lines) than the JE ones (dot-dashed lines). Nevertheless, for a sufficiently strong (and negative) Γ the predictions NPJEs are no longer reliable. Notice that while for Γ = 0.25 the system displays Josephson oscillations, i.e. coherent oscillations around z = 0, for Γ = 0.25 and Γ =  - 1.05 there are SSB oscillations, i.e coherent oscillations around z = zSSB  ≠  0.

We investigate in detail these coherent oscillations by looking for the stationary points and calculating the frequency of small oscillations around these points. In the case of NPJEs and JEs we diagonalize the Jacobian matrices associated, respectively, to the NPJEs ([\ref=evolution3])-([\ref=evolution3b]) and JEs ([\ref=evolution1])-([\ref=evolution1b]). In general, the 2  ×  2 Jacobian matrix has two complex eigenvalues, λ1,2, and the stationary point is stable when λ1,2  =    ∓  iω with ω > 0 the frequency of stable oscillations.

We consider first the Josephson regime and thus we study oscillations around the equilibrium points with z = 0 and θ = 0 (balanced population). Notice that for Γ = 0 the oscillation frequency ωJ reduces to the Rabi frequency, i.e. ωJ  =  2K / . In the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig4] we report the frequency ωJ of coherent oscillations around z = 0 as a function of Γ. From the plots of Fig. [\ref=fig4] one can see the differences between the behavior of ωJ predicted by 1D NPSE (dots), NPJEs (dashed line), and JEs (dot-dashed lines). Among the three sets of data obviously NPSE ones are the more reliable. The softening of ωJ as Γ < 0 approaches ΓSSB =  - 0.21 is reproduced extremely well by both NPJEs and JEs, while there are differences in corresponence of the hardening of ωJ for large positive values of Γ. At Γ = 1.5 the relative error in the determination of ωJ between NPSE and NPJEs results is about 15%.

We now analyze the oscillations in the SSB regime. As previously stressed to this regime is associated a symmetry breaking of the fractional population imbalance z, i.e the stationary configuration has θ = 0 but z = zSSB  ≠  0. In the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig4], we plot the SSB oscillation frequency ωSSB around the stationary zSSB  ≠  0 (with θ(0) = 0) as a function of Γ. From these plots one can see that when Γ is small enough the behavior of ωSSB predicted by NPJEs and JEs are quite similar, but NPJEs results are slightly better than JEs ones. ωSSB is equal to zero at ΓSSB and it increases by decreasing Γ < 0. As Γ approaches the collapse strength ΓC =  - 1.1 of 1D NPSE the relative error in the determination of ωSSB between NPSE and NPJEs results becomes quite large: it is about 50% at Γ  =   - 1.1. We have verified that, in contrast with JEs, NPJEs predict the BEC collapse but at a critical strength much smaller (in modulus much larger) than the one obtained by using the NPSE.

It is important to stress that it is possible to achieve the so-called "self-trapping regime" in correspondence of initial conditions (z(0),θ(0)) which are not stationary points of JEs [\cite=smerzi]. This regime is characterized by population imbalance (z(t)  ≠  0) and a running phase during the time evolution. By solving our NPJEs we find this dynamical self-trapping for Γc  <  Γ  <  Γ(ST, - ) < 0 or Γ  >  Γ(ST, + ) > 0 with the thresholds Γ(ST,  ∓  ) depending on the initial conditions z(0) and θ(0). Note that by solving JEs one finds Γc = 0 and also ΓST, - =  - ΓST, +.

In conclusion, we observe that the results obtained so far, can be used to describe concrete systems. For instance, by considering an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate made of 7Li atoms, and choosing the transverse confining frequency as [formula] Hz, we have a typical value of the transverse length [formula] μm, while the parameters of the double-well potential read: U0≃6  ·  10- 32J and x0≃8 μm [\cite=oliver] [\cite=gati]. The natural scattering length of 7Li atoms is as =  - 1.45 nm but it can be modified with an external constant magnetic field by means of a Feshbach resonance [\cite=col-exp]. Working with N≃104 condensed atoms in the trap, it is possible to observe experimentally the behavior of Josephson frequency ωJ and of the SSB frequency ωSSB by tuning the scattering length as from positive values to the collapse point at [formula] nm. Finally, we stress that with the above values the condition |g| / K  ≪  N2 is fully satisfied, and the system is always in the coherent regime [\cite=leggett] [\cite=mazza] [\cite=mazza2].
