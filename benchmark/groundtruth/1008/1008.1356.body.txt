Quantum stress tensor for massive vector field in the space-time of a cylindrical black hole

Quantum theory and General Relativity are two beautiful parts of modern physics that, for more than a century have been developed in such an extent that our knowledge of the universe at short and long scales has increased as never before in the human history. With the help of the quantum theory we can explain micro-world phenomena. On the other hand, the General Theory of Relativity allows us a deep understanding of the large scale structure of the universe. This two major achievements in theoretical physics in the 20th century, are still, nearly 100 years later, going separated ways. There is not yet such a thing as a theory of quantum gravity, but in their quest for the TOE (Theory of Everything), the physicists try to bring them together. Quantum gravitation is a tool that would be very important to describe, among other things, the creation of the universe and its later development.

One of the approaches developed to consider quantum effects in gravitation, called Semiclassical gravity, considers the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, which at this level of description is considered as a classical external field. In the absence of a full theory of quantum gravity, semiclasical gravity is a well established physical theory that help us to know what are the expected behavior of gravitational system under the influence of the interaction between it and matter fields that obeys the laws of quantum theory.

In this approximate theory, fundamental information about the quantum matter fields is contained in the renormalized quantum stress-energy tensor 〈Tνμ〉ren, that can, in principle, be constructed using a variety of mathematical techniques, including analytical, semianalytical and numerical ones, see [\cite=dowker] [\cite=browncassidy] [\cite=allenfolacci] [\cite=howardcandelas] [\cite=candelas] [\cite=fawcet] [\cite=jensen12] [\cite=AHS] [\cite=frolov] [\cite=DeWitt] [\cite=avramidi] [\cite=barvinsky] [\cite=matyjasek] [\cite=matyjasek1] [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2] and references therein.

For the important case of massive fields, one of the developed approaches for determining 〈Tνμ〉ren is based in the calculation of the renormalized quantum effective action for the quantized matter field, using the Schwinger-DeWitt proper time technique to give an expansion of the effective action in terms of the field inverse square mass. This is the celebrated Schwinger-DeWitt expansion, in which the first three terms renormalize the bare gravitational and cosmological constant, and adds some higher order terms to the Einstein gravitational action. The next order term, proportional to m- 2, where m is the mass of the field, gives us the one-loop effective action Wren for the matter field [\cite=frolov] [\cite=DeWitt] [\cite=avramidi] [\cite=barvinsky] [\cite=matyjasek] [\cite=matyjasek1] [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2].

By functional differentiation of the one-loop effective action, we can obtain the desired quantum stress tensor using the standard formula

[formula]

The above method has been applied to a number of space-times of interest, including Schwarzschild [\cite=frolov] [\cite=AHS], Reisner-Nordstrom [\cite=AHS] [\cite=matyjasek], charge dilatonic black holes and nonlinear electrically charged black holes in four dimensions [\cite=matyjasek1]. Also, in two recent papers we developed the Schwinger-DeWitt technique for the calculation of the renormalized stress energy tensor of massive scalar and spinor fields up to one loop order in the spacetime of static black strings [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2]. For this interesting system, the problems of investigate the renormalized stress tensor components for conformally coupled massless scalar fields were studied by DeBenedictis in [\cite=debenedictis1] [\cite=debenedictis2], who used the obtained 〈Tνμ〉ren for the calculation of gravitational backreaction of the quantum field. In this work we complete the series of papers [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2] dedicated to the calculation of 〈Tνμ〉ren for massive fields in the static black string background, determining the components of this tensor for the case of a massive vector field. We also investigate the fulfilment of the pointwise energy conditions for the quantized field in this gravitational background.

The corresponding metric element for the static black string spacetime is where M is the mass per unit length of the string. As we can see from ([\ref=ds2simp]), the considered metric has an event horizon located at [formula]and the only true singularity is a polynomial one at the origin.

The action for a single massive vector field Aμ with mass m in some generic curved spacetime in four dimensions is

[formula]

The equation of motion for the field have the form

[formula]

where the second order operator [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the covariant D'Alembert operator, [formula] is the covariant derivative.

The usual formalism of Quantum Field Theory give an expression for the effective action of the quantum field Aβ as perturbation expansion in the number of loops:

[formula]

where [formula] is the classical action of the free field. The one loop contribution of the field Aβ to the effective action is expressed in terms of the operator ([\ref=nonminimal]) as:

[formula]

where [formula] is the functional Berezin superdeterminant [\cite=avramidi] of the operator [formula], and [formula] is the functional supertrace [\cite=avramidi]. If the Compton's wavelength of the field is less than the characteristic radius of spacetime curvature [\cite=frolov] [\cite=barvinsky] [\cite=DeWitt] [\cite=avramidi] [\cite=matyjasek] [\cite=matyjasek1] [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2], we can develope an expansion of the above effective action in powers of the inverse square mass of the field. This approximation is known as the Schwinger-DeWitt one, and before applying this approach to the particular problem considered in this work we make the following remarks. In the first place, we mention that the Schwinger-DeWitt technique is directly applicable to "minimal" second order differential operators that have the general form:

[formula]

where Qμν(x) is some arbitrary matrix playing the role of the potential.

As we can see, because of the presence of the nondiagonal term in ([\ref=nonminimal]) it becomes a nonminimal operator, and this fact is an obstacle to applying the Schwinger-DeWitt technique. By fortune we can put ([\ref=nonminimal]) as function of some minimal operators, if we note that it satisfies the identity [formula]. Then, the effective action for the massive vector field is equal to the effective action of the minimal second order operator [formula] minus the effective action of a minimal operator [formula] corresponding to a massive scalar field minimally coupled to gravity.

Now using the Schwinger-DeWitt representation for the Green�s function of the minimal operators, we can obtain for the renormalized one loop effective action of the quantum massive vector field the expression [formula] where the renormalized effective Lagrangian reads:

[formula]

The quantities =    a(1)k(x,x') and =    a(0)k(x,x'), whose coincidence limit appears under the supertrace operation in ([\ref=renlagrangian]) are the HMDS coefficients for the minimal operators [formula] and [formula] respectively. As usual, the first three coefficients of the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion, a0,  a1,  and  a2, contribute to the divergent part of the action and can be absorbed in the classical gravitational action by renormalization of the bare gravitational and cosmological constants.

Restricting ourselves here to the terms proportional to m- 2, using integration by parts and the elementary properties of the Riemann tensor [\cite=avramidi] [\cite=matyjasek] [\cite=matyjasek1] [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2], we obtain for the renormalized effective lagrangian in the case of the massive vector field considered in this work As we can see, this final expression of the one loop effective for the massive vector field only differ from that of the massive scalar and spinor fields in the numerical coefficients in front of the purely geometric terms. For 〈Tμν〉ren we obtain a very cumbersome expression that, as in the case of ([\ref=renlagrangian1]), is different from that obtained for scalar and spinor fields only in the numerical coefficients that appears in front of the purely geometrical terms. For this reason we not put this very long expression for the stress tensor here and refers the readers to our previous papers [\cite=matyjasek] [\cite=matyjasek1] and [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2].

It is interesting to mention that in a beautiful paper Decáninis and Folacci [\cite=Folacci] have presented irreducible expressions for the metric variations of the gravitational action terms constructed from the 17 curvature invariants of order six in derivatives of the metric tensor i.e. from the geometrical terms appearing in the diagonal coefficient a3(x,x) of the Schwinger-DeWitt approximation, thus providing us with a general method to reduce the inevitable differences in the final expresions obtained for this quantities, due to the different simplification and canonization schemes chosen. From the general form of the geometric terms conforming the general expresion for the constructed 〈Tνμ〉ren, we see that it is covariantly conserved, thus indicating that it is a god candidate for the expected exact one in our large mass approximation.

After a direct calculation, we obtain for 〈Tνμ〉ren in the space-time of a static cylindrical black hole metric

[formula]

where we have defined the variable [formula] and due to the cylindrical symmetry we have [formula]. The numerical coefficients are given in Table I for each index μ. The dependence of the components of [formula] with y is displayed in figures ([\ref=figure1]) to ([\ref=figure3]).

If we consider the general expression ([\ref=set]) at the horizon of the cylindrical black hole, i.e, at y = 1, we easily found that the energy density [formula] for the quantum massive vector field is positive, in contrast with the results found in previous work for the scalar and spinor fields [\cite=owencabo1] [\cite=owencabo2].

Inspection of figure ([\ref=figure1]) shows that the energy density is positive everywhere. The principal pressures [formula] and [formula] are negative at the horizon. Figures ([\ref=figure2]) and ([\ref=figure3]) indicates that the radial pressure is negative in the region outside the horizon and that the other pressures are negative everywhere. At the event horizon ϱ  -  τ = 0, ϱ + p < 0 and ϱ  -  τ + 2p < 0. Also we have p <  - ϱ  <  ϱ. The second of the above relations indicates that the null energy condition (NEC) is violated at the event horizon of the static black string. For the weak energy condition (WEC) be satisfied, we need that the energy density be positive, as is indeed the case at the horizon, but we require that the NEC be satisfied. Then, in our case, also the weak energy conditions is violated. If the NEC is satisfied and the sum of the principal pressures and the energy density of the field is positive, then the strong energy condition (SEC) is valid. The dominant energy condition (DEC) requires -  ϱ  ≤  pj  ≤  ϱ. As we can see from the above relations between the energy density and the principal pressures at the horizon of the black string, the massive vector field also violates the SEC and DEC.

The results of this work are expected to be employed to investigate the back-reaction of the quantum scalar field, on the Black String metric. For this purpose, the Einstein equations for the metric should be solved after including in them the calculated stress tensor for the Black String solution. Our results of the implementation of this programm will be published in the future.
