Connectivity of Graphs Induced by Directional Antennas

Robin Flatland

Introduction

Let S be a set of points in the plane representing wireless nodes. Assume that each node is equipped with one directional antenna, geometrically represented as a wedge with angular aperture α and radius r (see Figure [\ref=fig:antenna]a). An antenna orientation is given by the counterclockwise angle θ measured from the positive x-axis to the bisector of the wedge. The communication graph G(S) formed by the antennas placed at points in S is a directed graph with vertex set S and edges [formula] directed from a to b, if and only if the antenna wedge at a covers b. Let

[formula]

UDG(S) is connected. For a fixed angle α, find an orientation θ of the antennas at the points in S and a minimum radius r for which the communication graph G(S) is strongly connected.

We consider instances of this problem for [formula] (Section [\ref=sec:180]) and [formula] (Section [\ref=sec:90]), and establish lower and upper bounds for the minimum radius required to guarantee strong connectivity. For the case [formula], we establish a lower bound of 2 and an upper bound of 7. For the case [formula] angles, we establish a lower bound of [formula] and an upper bound of [formula]. Underlying these results is the assumption that

[formula]

MST(S) to refer to a minimum spanning tree of S of maximum degree five, which can be constructed using the algorithm by Wu et al. [\cite=WDJLH06]. We say that a point a∈S sees b∈S if and only if the antenna wedge at a covers b.

[formula] Antennas

For directional antennas with [formula], [formula] is sometimes necessary to build a strongly connected communication graph.

Figure [\ref=fig:lowerbound180] shows a point set for which [formula] is necessary. The solid line segments show the UDG; all angles are [formula]. Note that for any [formula], any antenna placed at the point labeled p covers exactly two of its neighbors in the UDG and no other points. Split the UDG into two pieces, L and R, by removing the edge connecting p to its uncovered neighbor. Let R be the piece containing p. Observe that for any point p'  ≠  p in R, the distance from p' to any point in L is at least [formula]. Since messages must flow from R to L, [formula] is necessary.

For directional antennas with [formula], [formula] suffices to build a strongly connected communication graph for a planar point set S.

We begin by constructing

[formula]

MST(S) into groups, then show inductively how to orient the antennas in each group to form the communication graph. To identify the groups, pick a node of height one and place it in a group along with its children. Conceptually imagine removing this group from the tree, then repeat the process until no nodes are left (with the possible exception of the root). See Figure [\ref=fig:groups] for an example of node grouping.

We prove the theorem inductively on the number of groups g in

[formula]

MST(S) composed of g node groups, for some g  ≥  1, there is an orientation of antennas at the nodes of

[formula]

MST(S) can reach any hop within a unit distance. Note that this is true of the base case, with help from c1 if the hop is not covered by p's wedge.

To prove the inductive step, consider a tree

[formula]

MST(S), and call the group containing p the root group. We discuss four cases, depending on the number of nodes in the root group. The antenna placement for each of these cases is depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:placement180]. Observe that in the case of a triplet (Figure [\ref=fig:placement180]b), p's antenna is oriented so that is covers both children. It can be verified, in the cases with one and two children depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:placement180](a, b), r  ≤  2 guarantees strong connectivity, and p can reach any hop within a unit distance.

The cases with the root group composed of four and five nodes follow a similar pattern, once divided into pairs and triplets of nodes, as depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:placement180] (c, d). The dotted lines indicate children that have been paired. Pairs consisting of two children (see c2,c3 in Figure [\ref=fig:placement180]c) must be carefully selected to achieve [formula]; the requirement is that the two paired children form a smallest angle at p. Since the cases under discussion involve three or four children of p, an upper bound on a smallest such angle is [formula]. It follows that the distance between the paired children is at most [formula]. Then r  ≤  2 guarantees the following: (i) each pair and triplet of nodes is strongly connected, (ii) each node in a pair can send messages to p (because a node in a pair can reach its counterpart node with a setting [formula], and at least one node in a pair can reach p with a setting r  =  1), and (iii) p can reach any hop within unit distance (which includes its children). It follows that the communication graph for the root group is strongly connected. It remains to show that

[formula]

MST(S), and the parent accounts for one of these degree units. The one exception is the root of the entire tree. But since the root is the point with a highest y coordinate, all its children must lie in a halfplane. The minimum angle separating two adjacent points in a planar minimum spanning tree is [formula], so the root can also have most four children.)

By the inductive hypothesis, each subtree T  ⊂   MST(S) attached to a node in the root group forms a strongly connected communication graph. In addition, the root of T can reach any hop within unit distance, and therefore it can send messages up to the point of attachment. So to complete the inductive step, we must show that each node in the root group can send messages down to the root of an attached subtree. This is trivially true for p, since p can communicate with any point within unit distance, as established above.

Now consider the case when a child c of p is the attachment point for a subtree with root q. If c plays the role of c1 in a pair or a triplet (as in Figures [\ref=fig:placement180]a,b) and the antenna wedge at c1 does not cover q, then r  ≤  2 suffices to establish the communication path (c1,p,q). If c plays the role of c2 in a triplet (as in Figure [\ref=fig:placement180]b) and c2 does not see q, then there are two cases to consider. First, if p sees q, then the communication path is (c2,p,q). Otherwise, c1 must see q. The segment c2q cannot cross c1p since minimum spanning tree edges do not cross. This implies that q is confined to the shaded region from Figure [\ref=fig:bound180], therefore the distance from q to c1 is at most 2. It follows that r  ≤  2 establishes the communication path (c2,p,c1,q).

Finally, suppose that q is attached to a child of p that was paired with another child of p, such as c2 in Figure [\ref=fig:placement180]c. If c2 cannot see q, then c3 must be able to see q, so c2 can use the communication path (c2,c3,q). Since the distance between c2 and c3 is at most [formula], the last hop from c3 to q is no longer than [formula], matching the upper bound on r stated in the theorem.

It is possible that the root group contains a single node, the root p of

[formula]Antennas

For directional antennas with [formula], r  ≥  2 is sometimes necessary to build a communication graph.

Consider a set of points positioned along the x-axis at unit intervals. An antenna placed at a point p can only cover points to one side, say its left side (so the antenna at p is oriented to the left). To enable messages to flow from points left of p to points right of p, the antenna at some point left of p must be oriented to the right. The nearest such point is p's left neighbor, which is at distance two from p's right neighbor. Therefore, r  =  2 is necessary.

For any four points in general position, their [formula]antennas can be oriented such that (i) a radius equal to the maximum pairwise distance between the four points guarantees strong connectivity of the four points, and (ii) the four antennas cover the entire plane.

Consider first the case when the four points lie in convex position. Let a,b,c,d be the points in clockwise order around the hull. Since abcd is convex, the segments ac and bd must intersect, as illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:fourpoints]a. Assume without loss of generality that ac is the longer of the two segments, and therefore the projection of at least one of b and d onto the line supported by ac lies on the segment ac. The orientation of antennas depends on the counterclockwise angle β from ac to bd. We will assume [formula]; the case when [formula] is handled symmetrically by reflection about the vertical. It is not difficult to see that the orientation of antennas from Figure [\ref=fig:fourpoints]a covers the entire plane, since ab and cd intersect and β is less than [formula]. This settles claim (ii) of the lemma. We now turn to claim (i) of the lemma.

Let each antenna wedge have radius equal to the maximum pairwise distance between a,b,c,d. First note that, for each node pair (a,c) and (b,d), each node is contained in the antenna wedge of the counterpart node, enabling direct communication between the nodes within a pair. Communication between the pairs is settled as follows. Assume that it is the projection of d that lies on the segment ab, as shown in Figure [\ref=fig:fourpoints]a. Then d is contained in a's wedge, and d's wedge contains c, thus enabling full communication between the pairs, as illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig:fourpoints]b.

Consider now the case when the four points do not lie in convex position. Then three of the points, say a,b,c, comprise a triangle that contains the fourth point, d. See Figure [\ref=fig:fourpoints]c. Assume without loss of generality that ac is a longest edge of [formula]. Then the the projection b' of b onto ac lies interior to the segment ac. Let [formula] contain d (the situation when [formula] contains d is vertically symmetric). The antenna orientation is depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:fourpoints]c: all antenna wedges have one boundary line parallel to ac; the antennas at points a and b face each other, and similarly at points c and d. This guarantees coverage of the entire plane. In terms of connectivity, note that the nodes within each pair (a,b) and (c,d) can communicate directly in both directions. Since [formula], both a and b can see d, and c can see a and b (recall that ac is the longer side of [formula], therefore [formula] is acute, which implies that c sees b). This establishes full communication between the pairs.

For directional antennas with [formula], r = 7 suffices to build a strongly connected communication graph for a planar point set S.

The case when S consists of two points a and b is trivial: orient the antennas at a and b to point to each other. If S consists of three points a,b and c, then [formula] has at least two angles strictly smaller than [formula]. Orient the antennas at the apexes of these two angles to cover the entire triangle, then orient the third antenna toward either of the other two (see Figure [\ref=fig:3points]a). Then r  =  2 suffices to form a strongly connected communication graph, since max {|ab|,|ac|,|bc|}  ≤  2.

We now turn to the general case |S|  ≥  4. We create groups of nodes in

[formula]

MST(S), identify a smallest subtree T  ⊆    ~   MST(S) of four or more nodes, whose removal does not disconnect

[formula]

MST(S) and recurse. The process stops when

[formula]

MST(S)). In each group we select four representative nodes, one of which must be the root of the group subtree, and the other three could be arbitrary. For definitiveness we select the nodes shaded in Figure [\ref=fig:nodegroups] as representative nodes.

We prove the theorem inductively on the number of groups g in

[formula]

MST(S) consisting of g or fewer groups, that satisfies the theorem. In addition, the inductive hypothesis requires that the root of

[formula]

MST(S) with g + 1 groups. Assume first that the root group contains at least four nodes, so they are arranged in a subtree T  ⊆   MST(S) topologically equivalent to one of the trees from Figure [\ref=fig:nodegroups]. As in the base case, we orient the antennas at the representative nodes of T as in Theorem [\ref=thm:fourpoints], to establish coverage of the plane and strong connectivity between these nodes, for r  =  dmax. For each non-representative node x, orient the antenna at x to point towards a closest representative node y. A simple analysis of the tree topologies from Figure [\ref=fig:nodegroups] indicate that, in order to establish a connection from x to y, a radius of 1 for the antenna at x suffices for the cases depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:nodegroups](a,d), and a radius of 2 suffices for the cases depicted in Figure [\ref=fig:nodegroups](b, c). Summing up these values with dmax, we obtain that r  =  4 establishes full connectivity between the nodes of T (since one of the nodes in R can reach x in this case as well). We now show that r  =  5 guarantee strong connectivity of

[formula]

MST(S) is within unit distance from its parent, implies that each subtree attached to a node x∈T can send messages up to x (see the circular arcs in Figure [\ref=fig:90induction]a). We have established that a setting of r  =  4 enables strong connectivity between the nodes of T. It follows that r  =  5 enables each node x∈T to reach each child y of x, because with this setting at least one of the nodes in R can reach y (since their antennas cover the entire plane), and x can reach any node in R. In addition, r  =  5 enables the root of

[formula]

MST(S) contains fewer than four nodes, this group can be viewed as attached to the root q of any adjacent node group in
