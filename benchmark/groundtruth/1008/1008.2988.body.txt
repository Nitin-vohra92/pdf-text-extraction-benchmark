The Big-Line-Big-Clique Conjecture is False for Infinite Point Sets

Let P be a finite set of points in the plane. Two distinct points v and w in the plane are visible with respect to P if no point in P is in the open line segment [formula]. [\citet=KPW-DCG05] made the following Ramsey-theoretic conjecture, which has recently received considerable attention [\citep=KPW-DCG05] [\citep=Luigi] [\citep=EmptyPentagon-GC] [\citep=ABBCLPW] [\citep=PorWood-JoCG] [\citep=Matousek09].

Big-Line-Big-Clique Conjecture [\citep=KPW-DCG05] For all [formula] and [formula] there is an integer n such that every finite set of at least n points in the plane:

contains [formula] collinear points, or

contains k pairwise visible points.

This conjecture is true for k  â‰¤  5 or [formula] [\citep=KPW-DCG05] [\citep=Luigi] [\citep=EmptyPentagon-GC], and is open for k = 6 or [formula]. Note that the natural approach for attacking this conjecture using extremal graph theory fails [\citep=PorWood-JoCG]. Another natural approach for attacking the Big-Line-Big-Clique Conjecture is to follow an infinitary compactness argument (which can be used to establish many results in Ramsey theory). The purpose of this note is to show that this conjecture is false for infinite point sets, which suggests that an infinitary compactness argument cannot work.

There is a countably infinite point set with no 4 collinear points and no 3 pairwise visible points.

Let x1,x2,x3 be three non-collinear points in the plane. Given points [formula], define xn as follows. By the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, there is a line through exactly two of [formula]. Choose such a line [formula] with i < j such that j is minimum and then i is minimum. Insert xn on [formula], such that {xi,xn,xj} is the only collinear triple that contains xn. This is possible, since there are only finitely many ([formula]) excluded locations for xn.

Repeat this step to obtain a point set [formula], which by construction, contains no 4 collinear points. Moreover, if xi and xk are visible with i < k, then xi and xk are collinear with some other point xi' (otherwise some point would be added at a later stage in [formula]). Since i < k we have [formula] and i' < k.

Suppose on the contrary that three points xi,xj,xk are pairwise visible, where i < j < k. As proved above, [formula] and [formula], where i',j' < k. Since xk is in only one collinear triple amongst [formula], we have i' = j and j' = i. Thus xi,xk,xj are collinear, and xi and xj are not visible. This contradiction proves that no 3 points are pairwise visible.
