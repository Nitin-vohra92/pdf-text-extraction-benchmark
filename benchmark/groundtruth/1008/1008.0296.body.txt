Resource Letter PTG-1: Precision Tests of Gravity

Introduction

There was a time, as late as the 1960s, when general relativity was considered a theorist's paradise and an experimentalist's purgatory. The subject was dominated by theory and by theorists, and there was only a handful of experimental tests of the theory, some of questionable accuracy. But since that time, the field of gravitational physics has been transformed into a full partnership between theory and experiment. Tests of general relativity now take place in a wide range of arenas, from the laboratory table top, to the solar system, to neutron stars and black holes, all the way to the scales of cosmology. And new theoretical ideas, inspired by physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles or by cosmological discoveries such as the acceleration of the universe, are motivating new experiments.

In this Resource Letter I provide a guide to the recent literature on experimental gravitation. Although a few "classic" papers in this subject are included, I shall ignore most of the literature (such as it is) before the middle 1960s. In a few sub-topics some excellent comprehensive review articles have been published recently, so I shall refer to these where appropriate in place of a list of primary articles.

In Sec. II, I review basic resources for finding general information in this field, including journals, textbooks and broad review articles. In Sec. III, I turn to the primary research literature. Section III A covers the most relevant recent alternative theories of gravity, while Sec. III B deals with theoretical frameworks that are used to analyse experiments. In Sec. III C I discuss tests of the Einstein equivalence principle, which underlies the concept of curved spacetime. Section III D deals with tests of post-Newtonian gravity, mainly in the solar system. Section III E treats binary pulsars, and Sec. III F deals with searches for new physics in gravitational experiments. Finally, Sec. III G deals with the possibility of future tests of general relativity in the strong gravity, dynamical regime using gravitational waves or electromagnetic observations of phenomena near compact relativistic objects.

Primary research literature

Alternative theories of gravity

Standard general relativity is a theory in which the metric of spacetime is the only gravitational "field". Many alternative theories modify general relativity by incorporating new fields, such as scalars, vectors, or tensors, in addition to the metric.

Scalar-tensor theories

A search on "scalar-tensor" on the arXiv gives almost 300 hits since 1992 alone, so the literature is large and technical, with papers applying scalar-tensor theories to topics ranging from cosmology to quantum gravity. Below is a selection of papers that will serve as an introduction to the basics of scalar-tensor gravity.

. "Mach's Principle and a relativistic theory of gravitation," C. Brans and R. H. Dicke, Phys. Rev. 124 925-935 (1961).

Theoretical frameworks

The program of testing general relativity was aided by the development of general theoretical frameworks that attempted to encompass broad classes of theories of gravity in an unbiased manner. With these frameworks it was possible to classify and categorize alternative theories; to let experiment fix the values of various parameters, whose values depend on the theory chosen; and also to suggest experiments that might have been overlooked using general relativity alone.

The PPN framework

The parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) framework treats the weak-field, slow-motion (post-Newtonian) limit of a class of metric theories of gravity in terms of 10 arbitrary parameters, γ, β, and so on.

. "Equivalence principle for massive bodies. II. Theory," K. Nordtvedt, Jr., Phys. Rev. 169, 1017-1025 (1968). The origin of the modern PPN framework, building on earlier work by Eddington, Robertson, and Schiff. (A)

This "standard model extension" (SME) extends the Lightman-Lee framework to the entire realm of particle physics, specifically looking for ways to bound or discover violations of local Lorentz invariance. (A)

Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle

This principle is the foundation for the "geometric" approach to gravitation as exemplified by general relativity. It consists of the weak equivalence principle (bodies fall with the same acceleration), local Lorentz invariance (non-gravitational physics in a local freely falling frame is independent of the frame's velocity), and local position invariance (independent of the frame's location).

Tests of the weak equivalence principle

Although the idea that bodies fall with the same acceleration independent of internal structure or composition can be traced as far back as the 5th century, serious experimental tests began with Stevin and Galileo in the 16th century, followed by Newton in the 17th and Eötvös at the turn of the 20th. The "modern" period of high-precision tests began with Dicke's experiments at Princeton in the 1960s.

. "The equivalence of inertial and passive gravitational mass," P. G.  Roll, R.  Krotkov, and R. H.  Dicke, Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 26, 442-517, (1964). Dicke's pioneering experiment paved the way for generations of high-precision null tests of EEP. (A)

Motivated by the search for a "fifth force" (see Sec. [\ref=5thforce]), many groups got involved in testing the weak equivalence principle during the late 1980s.

Tests of local Lorentz invariance

While Lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of field theory and particle physics, many tests of local Lorentz invariance search for anomalies in atomic energy levels or in the speed of light.

Post-Newtonian gravity and solar system tests

The weak-field, slow-motion conditions of the solar system have provided many high-precision tests of general relativity. Here the PPN framework is used to cast each measurable effect in terms of a measurement of a PPN parameter or of a combination of PPN parameters.

Deflection of light

The measurement of the deflection of light by Eddington and colleagues during a 1919 total solar eclipse helped make Einstein famous, but five decades later there was still only modest improvement in accuracy, largely because of the inhospitable locations where the eclipse observations had to be made.

. "New method for the detection of light deflection by solar gravity," I. I. Shapiro, Science 157, 806-808 (1967). Shapiro proposed that radio interferometry could do a much better job than optical measurements. Many measurements followed during the late 1960s and early 1970s; see Ref. 1 for a survey. (A)

Lunar laser ranging

Nordtvedt pointed out that, in alternative theories of gravity, self-gravitational binding energy could fall with a different acceleration in an external field than normal matter, leading to a violation of the equivalence principle for massive bodies such as the Earth and Moon.

Mercury's perihelion

Ironically, while Mercury's perihelion advance is one of the three "crucial" tests of general relativity, it is almost impossible to find a modern paper that quotes the latest observational results. The reason is that modern analyses of solar system dynamics use the PPN framework (see Ref. 1) to describe the motion of all the planets, and combine all available data, such as planetary and spacecraft tracking, lunar laser ranging, and historical data, in a "global fit" to determine best values of the PPN parameters, along with other important solar system parameters, such as masses and orbital elements of planets and moons, the oblateness, or quadrupole moment J2 of the Sun, and even the masses of the largest asteroids. While observations of Mercury's orbit (mainly by radar) are part of the data sets, Mercury's perihelion advance is not a directly measured quantity. The results for the PPN parameters are consistent with Mercury's perihelion advance being known to a part in 103, in agreement with general relativity. There was once uncertainty about the agreement with GR because of the possibility of a large quadrupole moment of the Sun. This has now been resolved via helioseismology and improved orbital data.

Tests of frame dragging

In general relativity, a rotating mass (or a rotating black hole) "drags" spacetime around with it slightly, causing gyroscopes or orbits of particles to precess. This is one manifestation of what is sometimes called "gravitomagnetism," a component of gravity generated by mass currents, much like its electromagnetic counterpart.

Binary pulsars

The 1974 discovery of the binary pulsar 1913+16 by Hulse and Taylor provided a new testing ground for general relativity, involving the presence of both strong-field effects (the bodies are neutron stars) and gravitational radiation. The measurement of the decay of the orbit, in agreement with the gravitational-radiation energy-loss prediction of general relativity, led to a Nobel Prize for its discoverers.

Searching for new physics

The fifth force

A reanalysis of the classic Eötvös experiments by Fischbach and collaborators suggested the presence of a "fifth" force of nature with a range between a meter and a kilometer, and set off an intense experimental effort. The results ultimately placed strong limits on the proposed fifth force, and interest faded away.

Pioneer and other anomalies

The 1998 report of an anomalous, constant, sun-directed acceleration in the reduction of Doppler tracking data from the Pioneer, Galileo, and Ulysses spacecraft came to be called the "Pioneer anomaly." It has resulted in over 150 papers trying to account for it either by new physics, or by old engineering.

Tests of short-range gravity

Recent developments in particle physics suggest that there could exist extra spatial or temporal dimensions of finite or even infinite size, or that there could exist very low-mass particles that could mediate the interactions between standard hadrons. Some of these phenomena could lead to deviations of the law of gravitation from the standard inverse-square dependence at very short range, typically below a millimeter. These ideas led to a substantial experimental effort to search for such effects.

Precision tests in new regimes

Gravitational waves

The future detection of gravitational waves by laser-interferometric detectors such as the ground-based LIGO, Virgo, and GEO600 observatories and the proposed space-based LISA will provide ways to test general relativity in the strong-gravity, dynamical regime. Not only will it be possible to test the intrinsic properties of the waves (polarization, propagation speed), it will also be possible to test general relativity by measuring in detail the "signatures" imprinted in the waves by the sources, mainly inspiraling binary systems of compact bodies such as neutron stars or black holes. Some of these signatures will reflect the strong-field regime of the theory.

Strong-field gravity

Electromagnetic measurements may also provide strong-gravity tests of general relativity, although considerable astrophysical model building is involved in sorting out phenomena due to strong gravity from those due to complex physics.
