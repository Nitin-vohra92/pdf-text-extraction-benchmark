Consequences from conservation of the total density of the universe during the expansion

Introduction

The problem for the average density of the universe [formula] acquires significance when it was shown that the General Relativity allows to reveal the geometry and evolution of the universe by simple cosmological models [\cite=Friedmann] [\cite=Lemaitre] [\cite=Einstein]. Crucial for the geometry of the universe appears the dimensionless total density of the universe [formula], where [formula] is the average density of the universe and ρc is the critical density of the universe. In the case of Ω0 < 1 (open universe) the global spatial curvature is negative and the geometry of the universe is hyperbolic and in the case of Ω0 > 1 (closed universe) the curvature is positive and the geometry is spherical. In the special case of Ω0 = 1 (flat universe) the curvature is zero and the geometry is Euclidean. Until recently scarce information has been available about the density and geometry of the universe. The most reliable determination of the total density Ω0 is by measurements of the dependence of the anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) upon the angular scale. The recent results have shown that [formula], where the error ΔΩ0 decreases from 0.10 [\cite=de_Bernardis] [\cite=Balbi] to 0.02 [\cite=Spergel], i.e. the density of the universe is close to the critical one and the universe is asymptotically flat (Euclidean).

The fact that Ω0 is so close to a unit is not accidental since only at Ω0 = 1 the geometry of the universe is flat and the flat universe was predicted from the inflationary theory [\cite=Guth]. The total density Ω0 includes density of baryon matter [formula], cold dark matter [formula] [\cite=Peacock] and dark energy [formula] [\cite=Hinshaw], producing an accelerating expansion of the universe [\cite=Riess] [\cite=Perlmutter]. The found negligible CMB anisotropy [formula] indicates that the early universe was very homogeneous and isotropic [\cite=Bennett]. Three-dimensional maps of the distribution of galaxies corroborate homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales greater than 100  Mps [\cite=Shectman] [\cite=Stoughton].

Consequences from conservation of the total density of the universe during the expansion

The flat geometry of the universe allows to solve some cosmological problems in the Euclidean space. The finite time of the cosmological expansion H- 1 (age of the universe) and the finite speed of the light c set a finite particle horizon R  ~  cH- 1 beyond which no material signals reach the observer. Therefore, for an observer in an arbitrary location, the universe appears a three-dimensional, homogeneous and isotropic sphere having finite radius (particle horizon) equal to the Hubble distance R  ~  cH- 1, where [formula] km s- 1 Mps- 1 [\cite=Mould] is the Hubble constant and [formula] years is the Hubble time (age of the universe).

The fact that the total density of the universe Ω0 is close to a unit is fundamental since only [formula] supplies flat geometry of the universe. There are no arguments to assume the recent epoch privileged in relation to the other epochs; therefore, the universe always remains flat, and the total density of the universe Ω0 is conserved equal to a unit during the cosmological expansion:

[formula]

The critical density of the universe [\cite=Peebles] is determined from equation ([\ref=Eqn2]):

[formula]

where G is the universal gravitational constant.

Considering [formula], where M and R are the mass and the Hubble distance ( radius) of the observable universe, and replacing ρc with expression ([\ref=Eqn2]) in ([\ref=Eqn1]) we obtain:

[formula]

Replacing H  ~  cR- 1 in ([\ref=Eqn3]) we obtain:

[formula]

Obviously, ([\ref=Eqn4]) appears the formula for the Schwarzschild radius [\cite=Schwarzschild] of the mass of the observable universe M. Therefore, the Schwarzschild radius of the observable universe Rs is equal to the Hubble distance [formula] light years.

From ([\ref=Eqn4]) we find:

[formula]

Evidently, ([\ref=Eqn5]) is the formula of the parabolic velocity for the Hubble sphere, i.e. the sphere having mass M and a radius, equal to the Hubble distance R  ~  cH- 1. Therefore, the speed of the light c appears the parabolic velocity vp for the observable universe.

Below, we find that the recessional velocity vr = Hr of an arbitrary galaxy at a distance r > 100 Mps from the observer is equal to the parabolic velocity for a sphere, having radius r and a centre, coinciding with the observer. As mentioned at the end of the Introduction, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales greater than 100 Mps. Therefore, the average density ρr of a sphere having radius r > 100 Mps is equal to the average density of the universe [formula]:

[formula]

where m is the mass of the total matter in the sphere.

We find from equation ([\ref=Eqn6]):

[formula]

Replacing H in the Hubble law vr = Hr we obtain the recessional velocity of a galaxy:

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Eqn8]) coincides with the formula for the parabolic velocity of a sphere, having radius r and a centre, coinciding with the observer.

Finally, the requirement for conservation of the total density of the universe equal to a unit during the expansion allows to estimate the total mass of the observable universe M. Actually, replacing R  ~  cH- 1 in ([\ref=Eqn3]) we find:

[formula]

Obviously, this mass is close to the mass of the Hubble sphere MH:

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=Eqn9]) has been derived independently by dimensional analysis without consideration of the average density of the universe in [\cite=Valev_2009] [\cite=Valev_2010] and practically coincides with the Hoyle-Carvalho formula for the mass of the universe [\cite=Hoyle] [\cite=Carvalho], obtained by a totally different approach.

Conclusions

The recent CMB experiments have shown that the average density of the universe is close to the critical one and the universe is asymptotically flat. The flat geometry of the universe allows to solve some cosmological problems in the Euclidean space. Taking into account that the universe remains flat and the total density of the universe Ω0 is conserved equal to a unit during the expansion, the Schwarzschild radius of the observable universe has been determined equal to the Hubble distance Rs = 2GM / c2 = R  ~  cH- 1, and the speed of the light c appears the parabolic velocity for the observable universe [formula]. Besides, the recessional velocity vr = Hr of an arbitrary galaxy at a distance r > 100 Mps from the observer, is equal to the parabolic velocity of a sphere, having radius r and a centre, coinciding with the observer.

The requirement for conservation of Ω0 = 1 during the cosmological expansion enables to derive the Hoyle-Carvalho formula for the mass of the observable universe M = c3 / (2GH) by a new approach.
