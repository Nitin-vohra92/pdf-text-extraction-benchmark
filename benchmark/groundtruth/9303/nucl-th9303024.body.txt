In the earlier works[\cite=We1] [\cite=We2] it has been shown that the bulk of the nuclear EMC-effect in deep inelastic lepton scattering (DILS) can be explained by the binding correction which leads to the x-rescaling of structure functions. This result has restricted the possible contribution of more exotic effects. However, in some later papers it was claimed that the binding correction is unimportant in nuclear DILS. For example, the authors of Refs.[\cite=BC]-[\cite=JK] conclude that the binding correction almost vanishes if the light front (LF) formulation is used instead of the instant form (IF) one. This point of view was shared by several authors. Here it will be shown that the binding correction in the LF representation is essentially the same as in the IF representation. The aim of this note is to clear up both the role of binding in the nuclear EMC effect and the connection between the LF and IF descriptions of DILS.

In the LF representation, the operator [formula] belongs to the stability group that maps the quantization surface x- = 0 onto itself [\cite=Dir] [\cite=LS]. This means that for any physical system (not necessarily free and/or localizable) the three-momentum [formula] is among the observables: it is well defined, strictly conserved and transformed according to the Lorentz transformations. The momentum [formula] in the LF representation is an analog of the usual three-momentum [formula] in the IF representation. For an interacti ng particle, the momentum [formula] is the parameter on which the interactions of this particle depend. Therefore the observed momenta [formula] of interacting particles and their interactions are interconnected.

For any particle (with non-zero mass), the "Hamiltonian" P- can be rewritten by introducing the mass operator M,

[formula]

For free particles, the free mass m is the sharp value of the mass operator and in this case P- is the remaining component of the four-momentum. However, for interacting particles, the four-momentum is not defined [\cite=LS] and only the three-momentum [formula] is a defined physical value. Therefore it is irrelevant to discuss whether or not the interacting particles are on-mass-shell in the LF representation. One should not be confused by the fact that in the derivation of the Weinberg equation [\cite=Wei],

that was often adopted to describe the LF dynamics, the on-mass-shell energies of intermediate particles were used in the energy denominators. It was shown[\cite=CM] that the Weinberg equation is just another form to represent the Feynman diagrams in terms of LF variables. The fact that any Feynman diagram can be rewritten as the sum of old-fashioned perturbation theory diagrams does not mean that interacting particles are on-mass-shell in the time-ordered perturbation theory. Hopefully, as it is demonstrated here, the full four-momenta of interacting nucleons are not needed to reveal the nuclear binding effect.

In incoherent impulse approximation for the inclusive scattering, the nucleus structure function in the LF representation can be written in the convolution form [\cite=BC] [\cite=Oel]

[formula]

where the nucleon momentum distribution function ρ() is given by (see, e.g., Ref.[\cite=Oel])

[formula]

By the sum in this equation the integration over continuum states and momenta is understood. The normalization condition

[formula]

follows from the definition. The structure function (2) can be directly used to calculate the ratio FA2(x)  /  FN2(x) that is determined in the experiments.

The explicit form (3) of the momentum distribution function reminds us that the inclusive cross section is the sum of squared amplitudes with residual (A-1)-nuclei in the final state. This form allows to make a physical intepretation of the momenta: A,A - 1, and [formula] are the LF momenta of initial nucleus, residual nucleus and struck nucleon, respectively (as usual, the final state interactions are neglected). Since the momentum [formula] is strictly conserved , we have

[formula]

We stress that within the adopted physical picture the LF state vectors |A〉 and |n,A - 1〉 describe the free localizable systems. The LF four-momenta of these systems are well defined and trivially related to the usual four-momenta. For example, in the target nucleus rest frame

[formula]

where EB is the (positive) binding energy per nucleon. The states |n,A - 1〉 are not observed in inclusive reactions. By averaging over the velocity direction of the residual nucleus in the target rest frame we obtain

[formula]

where 〈En〉 and 〈Ekin〉 are the average excitation and kinetic energies of the (A-1) nucleus. For heavy nuclei E'B  ≈  EB and for the deuteron E'B = 0.

As it follows from (2), the nuclear structure function is determined by p+ of a struck nucleon. To estimate the nuclear binding effect, it is convenient to use the expansion [\cite=We2]

[formula]

where

[formula]

For the qualitative estimates, at x  ≤  0.5 it is sufficient to keep only the first term of this expansion. From (5)-(9) we obtain

[formula]

where ΔEB  =  (A - 1)(EB  -  E'B). The positive term in brackets in the above equation can be recognized as the nucleon separation energy Esep. For heavy nuclei

[formula]

and by (8)-(11) we recover the earlier results for the nuclear binding correction [\cite=We1] [\cite=We2].

It is possible to use the moment expansion introduced by Glazek and Schaden [\cite=GS], as well,

[formula]

where

[formula]

From (2)-(4) and (10) we obtain I1  =  1 and

[formula]

in agreement with the IF results.

In Refs.[\cite=BC]-[\cite=JK], as well as in many other papers on this subject, it was assumed that in the LF representation there was an exact sum rule

[formula]

From (4), (13) and (15) it follows that

[formula]

The moment I'2 describes the binding effect in the approach of Refs.[\cite=BC]-[\cite=JK] and for medium and heavy nuclei I'2 is much less than I2 from (14). For the deuteron I'2  ~  I2 since in this case 〈En〉  ~  0 ( note that I'2 from Ref.[\cite=JK] must be further corrected by the mA  /  AmN factor as in the equation (14) from Ref.[\cite=BC]).

The sum rule (15) can be obtained by keeping only the nucleon part of the energy-momentum tensor [\cite=SF]. But this part of the energy-momentum tensor, without the meson self-energy part, is not sufficient to describe the bound system of nucleons. By comparing (14) and (16) we can conclude that the binding correction is roughly the measure of violation of the momentum sum rule (15) by meson field s. The same situation can be found in one-nucleon case on the quark-gluon level: the LF momentum sum rule is not fulfilled with only current quarks and antiquarks, without the gluon contribution [\cite=LS].
