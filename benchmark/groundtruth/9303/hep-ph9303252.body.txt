ABSTRACT

The cosmological and astrophysical implications of a shadow matter model which could also have interesting experimental consequences are examined. The model has identical microphysics for both the ordinary and shadow worlds but requires a macroscopic asymmetry from nucleosynthesis constraints. It is proposed that this macroscopic asymmetry can be generated at the quark-hadron phase transition.

From time to time there have been some speculation about the existence of "shadow matter" in the Universe and its consequences [\cite=mp] [\cite=kst] [\cite=flv]. This shadow matter is another form of matter which is thought to interact with ordinary matter via gravity or via interactions of comparable strength to gravity. Some of the astrophysical and cosmological implications of generic shadow matter models have been studied in Ref.[\cite=kst]. In this paper the astrophysical and cosmological consequences of a particular realization of the shadow matter scenario, which may also have interesting collider physics, will be discussed.

The construction of a shadow matter model is quite straightforward. Consider the Lagrangian

[formula]

where L1,2 describes the physics of the ordinary and shadow worlds respectively. If the requirement that the microphysics of the two worlds be identical is imposed then there exists a discrete symmetry such that

[formula]

Let G1,2 be the gauge group of L1,2 where G1 and G2 are isomorphic and interchange under the discrete symmetry. The gauge group of L is then [formula] with the particle content of the ordinary and mirror worlds described by the representations [formula]. For example, the gauge group could be [formula] as motivated by superstring theories. The discrete symmetry between the ordinary and shadow worlds may or may not survive at low energies.

In the following the gauge group, G1,2, is taken to be the Minimal Standard Model (MSM) which means that the particle content of each sector contains no more than one Higgs doublet and no right-handed neutrinos. This model has been discussed previously (see Ref.[\cite=flv]) with the motivation that the discrete symmetry between the two sectors be interpreted as an improper spacetime symmetry, e.g. parity. It is perhaps interesting to note that this discrete symmetry remain intact at low energies after gauge symmetry breaking.

What is of more interest is that this model could have testable consequences at future collider experiments. This comes from the non-gravitational interactions caused by the mixing of the two sectors, viz., the mixing of the Higgs fields and the tree-level gauge kinetic mixing term of the U(1) fields. To establish notation, the interaction terms of interest are given as follows: The Higgs potential is

[formula]

If λ1,2  >  0, then the minimum is the vacuum

[formula]

As in the MSM, each Higgs doublet will give mass to the W± and Z bosons in their respective worlds after symmetry breaking. There will also be two physical scalars, η1,2, which have non-degenerate masses due to the mixing. Their masses are related by

[formula]

The ordinary and shadow worlds can then communicate via the Yukawa interactions mediated by the physical Higgs particles. The Yukawa Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

where f and F are the generic ordinary and shadow fermions respectively and m is their mass. There will be two potentially measurable effects if the masses of the two physical scalars are quite different from each other. Firstly, the coupling of any one of these Higgs particles to ordinary fermions is [formula] that of the standard model Higgs boson. Therefore the probability of producing one of these Higgs particles is 1 / 2 that of the standard model Higgs boson. Secondly, once one of these Higgs particles has been produced then it will decay half of the time into undetectable shadow matter and thereby the invisible decay channels will make up half of its width.

The gauge kinetic interaction is given by

[formula]

where Fμν1,2  =  ∂μAν1,2  -  ∂νAμ1,2 and Aμ1,2 are the U(1)1,2 gauge fields respectively. A rescaling and a rotation of the U(1) fields puts the gauge-fermion Lagrangian into standard form and results in a modification of the electromagnetic couplings of the fermions. The ordinary photon couples to

[formula]

while the shadow photon couples to

[formula]

where Q1,2 are the electric charge generators for the ordinary and shadow worlds respectively (e.g. [formula] and Q2  =  0 for ordinary matter and vice versa for shadow matter), θW is the usual electroweak mixing angle and e is the electromagnetic coupling. Therefore the charged shadow particles will appear as mini-charged particles in the ordinary world.[\cite=mcp]

Having reviewed the possible experimental consequences of this model, it would be interesting to see if the model is compatible with standard big bang cosmology. Note that if the mixing parameters between the ordinary and shadow worlds are made sufficiently small, then the two sectors decouple, leaving gravity as the only interaction between them. The cosmological and astrophysical implications of such a model have been discussed in Ref.[\cite=kst]. It was found that the nucleosynthesis bounds on the Helium abundance ruled out models which have exact microscopic and macroscopic symmetries between the ordinary and shadow worlds. However, it is still possible to have a model with identical microphysics between the two sectors but with different macrophysics. This macroscopic asymmetry can be quantified by a temperature difference. Nucleosynthesis bounds require Ts / T  ≤  0.68 for three light neutrino species, where Ts and T are the temperatures for the shadow and ordinary sectors respectively. One could attribute this temperature difference to some as yet unknown dynamics (e.g. inflation) occuring at some early epoch of the evolution of the Universe. In any case, the temperature difference can be treated as an effective initial condition. Since there are additional non-gravitational interactions in the model considered here, it is necessary to check that these interactions do not bring the two sectors into thermal equilibrium given the initial temperature difference.

First, consider the gauge interactions between the two sectors, i.e. [formula] mediated by a s-channel photon. The two sectors will not come into equilibrium if the interaction rate is less than the expansion rate of the Universe. An estimate of the interaction rate is given by

[formula]

where n  ~  T3 is the fermion number density, σ is the scattering cross section, vrel is the relative velocity between the colliding particles and αem is the usual electromagnetic fine structure constant. The expansion rate of the Universe for the radiation dominated epoch is

[formula]

where g* counts the total number of effectively massless degrees of freedom and Mpl is the Planck mass. For the situation when Γ / H  ≤  1 then

[formula]

Now consider the Higgs sector, but at temperatures above the electroweak phase transition (EWPT). The two sectors can communicate via [formula] and their respective Yukawa interactions with fermions. By estimating the ratio of the interaction rate to the expansion rate of the Universe for the Higgs scattering process, i.e.

[formula]

one finds that [formula] for T  ~  102 GeV if [formula]. This is a disappointing result from an experimental/collider physics point of view since the Higgs particles are nearly degenerate (see Eq.([\ref=hm])) and hence the Higgs sector becomes the same as that in the standard model. Therefore it seems that the desirability of having a sizeable mass splitting between η1 and η2 means that the two sectors will eventually come into thermal equilibrium given an initial temperature difference.

This, however, is not the whole story. Now consider what happens below the EWPT. At temperatures below the EWPT the Higgs-Higgs scattering interaction will freeze out if the lightest Higgs mass is assumed to be of the order of 100 GeV. The two sectors will now communicate via their Yukawa interactions (Eq.([\ref=yuk])) since the physical Higgs particles couple to both worlds. The interaction rate for [formula] is (for [formula])

[formula]

where g is the internal degrees of freedom of the scattering fermion, ζ(3)≃1.2, mf is the fermion mass and Mη is the lightest Higgs boson mass (see Eq.([\ref=hm])). Then by using Eq.([\ref=ex]) and [formula] gives a decoupling temperature,

[formula]

For u  ~  102 GeV, mf  ~  1 GeV, Mη  ~  102 GeV, [formula] and k  =  2 gives a decoupling temperature around 1 GeV. (Note that smaller fermion masses will give a higher decoupling temperature. For heavy fermions, such as the t-quark with mass of the order of 100 GeV, their interactions will freeze out.) So for temperatures below about 1 GeV the two sectors are no longer in chemical equilibrium and hence decouple. It is perhaps fortuitous that the decoupling of the two sectors occur before nucleosynthesis begins. However, the temperature of the two worlds remain the same. Thus, there exists the necessary but not sufficient conditions for a departure from thermal equilibrium between the ordinary and shadow worlds. So is there any way to generate the required temperature difference,

[formula]

to satisfy the nucleosynthesis bounds?

Presumably, since the departure from chemical equilibrium occurs at a temperature not too far away from the quark-hadron phase transition (QHPT), there might be some hope that this phase transition could generate the required out-of-equilibrium conditions. One scenario is to consider thermal fluctuations at the QHPT generating the temperature difference between the ordinary and shadow worlds. The hope here is that, in the process of nucleating bubbles of the hadron phase, the specific heat of the hadron bubble is sufficiently small to generate a large enough temperature difference between the two sectors. This scenario assumes a first order QHPT [\cite=lat91] and uses a simple model of nucleation [\cite=ll] [\cite=others]. The details of this scenario can be described as follows.

When the temperature falls below the critical value, Tc, the quark-gluon plasma is supercooled and bubbles of hadron gas nucleate and grow. For the remainder of this paper it will be assumed that the amount of supercooling will be relatively small. The bubbles of the hadron phase grow by deflagration heating of the surrounding plasma back to a temperature near Tc where the two phases coexist in unstable thermal equilibrium. Eventually the hadron phase grows slowly at the expense of the quark-gluon phase. When the hadron phase occupies about 50% of the space then the plasma begins to shrink. This is the qualitative picture of what is believed to have happened during a first order cosmological QHPT.

Now consider the stage when the hadron phase is nucleated. Only bubbles of a certain minimum or critical size, rc, survive to grow and form a centre of condensation for the formation of a new phase. Bubbles smaller than the critical size will shrink and eventually disappear. The critical radius of the bubble is given by

[formula]

where γ is the surface tension between the two phases and Ph  -  Pq is the pressure difference between the two phases. It is known [\cite=ll] that the surface tension depends on the temperature and vanishes at Tc. From dimensional arguments, [formula], where f is some unknown function. Without any additional information, it might be reasonable, for small supercooling, to expand γ(T) near T  =  Tc (assuming [formula] to be finite) giving

[formula]

where γ0 is a dimensionless constant expected to be of order one and ΔT  =  Tc  -  T. ( Eq.([\ref=st]) is equivalent to writing γ(T) as [formula]. ) The pressure difference can be estimated by assuming that the relativistic degrees of freedom dominate the pressure: i.e. only pions, u- and d-quarks, gluons and their shadow world counterparts contribute to the pressure difference for T  ~  Tc  =  100  -  200 MeV. This then gives

[formula]

where Pvac is the pressure of the nonperturbative vacuum exerted on the perturbative vacuum. Pvac can be written in terms of the critical temperature, which is defined as the temperature when Ph  =  Pq. Thus [formula]. For T near Tc,

[formula]

Hence the critical radius of the bubble (see Eq.([\ref=rc])) is

[formula]

The specific heat of the bubble can now be estimated to give

[formula]

where the term in the last set of parenthesis is the volume of the bubble. Substituting Eq.([\ref=rc2]) into the above gives

[formula]

This result in turn allows an estimation of the size of the temperature fluctuations in the hadron bubble. If the fluctuations are not too large in size then they can be described by a Gaussian distribution. Their root-mean-squared value (RMS) is

[formula]

for T  ~  Tc. By requiring [formula] gives [formula] which is consistent with the order of one expectations for the value of γ0. Therefore it appears plausible that fluctuations during the nucleation of the hadron phase can produce the required temperature difference to be established between the ordinary and shadow worlds.

To elucidate the above discussion, the proposed scenario can summarised as follows: Nucleosynthesis requires that the ordinary and shadow worlds be at different temperatures given identical microphysics between the two worlds. For [formula], the electromagnetic interaction will not contribute to bringing the two worlds into thermal equilibrium given an initial temperature difference between the two worlds. The Higgs interaction, for an experimentally interesting paramter space, will be of sufficient strength to bring the two sectors into equilibrium at temperatures above the EWPT. Below the EWPT the two sectors are no longer in chemical equilibrium when the temperature is around 1 GeV. However, the two sectors will still be at the same temperature. It was conjectured that the nucleation of the hadron phase at the QHPT can produce large enough fluctuations to establish the required temperature difference between the two worlds.

So far it has been shown that the model with an experimentally interesting parameter space could be compatible with standard big bang cosmology. It might be pertinent to check if there are any contraints from astrophysical considerations. An obvious constraint comes from the possible energy loss of a neutron star when ordinary particles in the star can produce shadow particles via the electromagnetic and Higgs interactions. Since the shadow particles interact very weakly with the ordinary world then there exists the possibility that the shadow matter carries off too much energy and cools the star too rapidly. An estimate of this energy loss is given by

[formula]

where Vcore is the volume of the core of the star, [formula] is the number density, σ is the interaction cross section, vrel is the relative velocity between the interacting particles and [formula] is the average energy of the particles in the star. For core temperatures of the order of 10 MeV, it is expected that only electrons participate in the production of shadow matter. Taking the core radius to be 10 km, the energy loss for the electromagnetic interaction is Q  ~  1066κ2 erg/s, while for the Higgs interaction, it is Q  ~  1032 erg/s. By requiring that the energy loss be less than 1053 erg/s gives [formula]. Therefore astrophysics gives a relatively weak constraint on the shadow model parameters.

In conclusion, it has been shown that the existence of a shadow matter world with identical microphysics to that of the ordinary world can have an interesting experimental parameter space and at the same time need not be incompatible with standard big bang cosmology if the macrophysics of the two worlds differ. It was speculated that the macro-asymmetry between the two sectors can be generated by fluctuations at the quark-hadron phase transition.
