The inclusive radiative B-decay is a sensitive probe of new physics, especially if related to the virtual exchange of a charged Higgs boson. Supersymmetric models provide a particularly interesting example.

In the limit of exact supersymmetry, BR(b  →  sγ) = 0, due to the vanishing of any magnetic-moment transition operator. We illustrate the impact of this constraint for realistic values of the supersymmetry-breaking parameters.

Recently it has been pointed out [\cite=barg] [\cite=jap] that the experimental upper bound on the branching fraction for the inclusive decay mode b  →  sγ, BR(b  →  sγ)<  8.4  ×  10- 4 at 90% C.L. [\cite=cleo], imposes a severe constraint on the existence of a charged Higgs boson. Indeed the absence of large hadronic uncertainties in the theoretical prediction for the inclusive radiative B-decay allows one to extract a reliable limit on the charged Higgs mass, which depends only on ΛQCD and the top-quark mass (mt), and which is more stringent than the limits from B0-0 mixing, K physics, or direct collider experiments.

It has also been argued [\cite=barg] that the experimental bound on BR(b  →  sγ) excludes large portions of the parameter space of the supersymmetric Higgs sector and, in particular, it pre-empts LEP-II searches. This conclusion has been reached by considering only the W boson and charged Higgs contribution to BR(b  →  sγ), but neglecting the effects of the supersymmetric partners. In this letter, we want to show that the inclusion of these effects strongly modifies the result. This is due to the fact that, in the limit of exact supersymmetry, any magnetic moment-transition operator vanishes [\cite=rem] and therefore BR(b  →  sγ) = 0. As supersymmetry-breaking terms are turned on, the rate for the decay b  →  sγ no longer vanishes, but it can still be considerably suppressed by the approximate cancellation. The possibility of having, in the supersymmetric case, a rate for b  →  sγ lower than the standard model one was already pointed out in ref. [\cite=mas], performing a general exploration of the parameter space. Here we show why and where such a suppression should particularly be expected.

The branching ratio for b  →  sγ, in units of the branching ratio for the semileptonic b decay, is:

[formula]

where η  =  αs(mZ) / αs(mb). In eq. (1) I is the phase-space factor, I(x) = 1 - 8x2 + 8x6 - x8 - 24x4 log x, and f is the QCD correction factor, f(mc / mb) = 2.41 [\cite=infn], for the semileptonic process, and C is a coefficient coming from operator mixing in the leading logarithmic QCD corrections computed in ref. [\cite=mis] and given in the appendix. Finally Aγ and Ag are the coefficients of the effective operators for bs-photon and bs-gluon interactions:

[formula]

The contributions to Aγ and Ag from the exchange of W bosons [\cite=ina], charged Higgs bosons [\cite=hig], and supersymmetric particles [\cite=mas] have all been computed already, and we present them in the appendix. Here we want to single out the effect of the supersymmetric contribution, but avoid the dependance on many unessential unknown parameters. We therefore consider the limit in which: (i) the diagonal gaugino and higgsino mass terms are neglected; (ii) the two Higgs vacuum expectation values are equal (tan β = 1); (iii) all squarks, other than the scalar partners of the top quark, have the same mass [formula]; (iv) the supersymmetry-breaking trilinear coupling A is zero, and therefore the two scalar partners of the top quark have mass t  =  2 + m2t.

Assumptions (i), (ii), and (iv) do not sizeably affect our results, as discussed in the appendix, but allow a great simplification of their description. In particular the value of tan β is irrelevant for the Higgs contribution [\cite=barg] [\cite=jap] and for the chargino contributions (see appendix), as long as tan β  ≥  1, which is always the case in the interesting supersymmetric models. With this choice of parameters, the two charginos are exactly degenerate with the W boson. Assumption (iii) corresponds to a hypothesis of minimal flavor violation, which means that the Yukawa couplings are the only source of flavor non-conservation. The authors of ref. [\cite=mas] also studied the possibility of flavor violation caused by a misalignment of squarks and quarks, after renormalization effects are taken into account, which gives rise to gluino-mediated flavor-changing neutral currents. We ignore here these effects, which are strongly model-dependent and usually rather small, if one considers flavor-symmetric boundary conditions for the squark mass matrices at the unified scale.

Under the above-stated hypothesis, the coefficients Aγ and Ag become:

[formula]

[formula]

where mH is the charged-Higgs mass and the functions f(1,2)γ,g are defined in the appendix. Equation (3) exhibits exact cancellation as we approach the supersymmetric limit z  →  0, y  →  x.

Figure 1 shows the numerical evaluation of eq. (1), with Aγ,g as in eq. (3) and αs(mZ) = 0.118, BR(b  →  ce) = 10.7%, mb = 4.8 GeV, mc / mb = 0.3. The chargino contributions to this rate die out as [formula] becomes large. Because of negative interference of these same contributions, the reduction of the rate, for any given charged-Higgs mass, is apparent from the figures. Notice that there also is a large portion of parameter space where BR(b  →  sγ) is actually smaller than the standard model prediction. The vanishing of the rate in the supersymmetric limit would occur in these contour plots for  = 0 and mH = mW. As discussed in the appendix, the results shown in fig. 1 for special values of the supersymmetric parameters are representative of a significantly larger portion of the parameter space, whenever [formula] GeV.

We infer from the existing literature that the uncertainty in the prediction of BR(b  →  sγ) coming from the uncertainties in the values of αs(mZ) [\cite=mis] and in higher-order QCD corrections [\cite=ali] is less than about 25%. This point is important enough to deserve further studies.

The expected improvement in the experimental bound on BR(b  →  sγ) will undoubtedly provide very useful information on the allowed supersymmetric parameter space. It is very important to realize that a significant deviation, in either direction, from the standard model prediction may indeed occur [\cite=mas].
