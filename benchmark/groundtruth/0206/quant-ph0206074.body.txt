How One Shutter Can Close N Slits

Probably the most paradoxical claim of quantum theory is that a particle can be in some sense in several places simultaneously. Without this feature one cannot explain the interference picture obtained in multiple-slit experiments performed with one particle at a time. A more robust claim of this type can be made about quantum pre- and post-selected particle. With utilization of a particular pre- and post-selection, we can claim that the particle should have been found with certainty in each one out of several places given that it was looked for only in that place [\cite=AV91]. Such claims became a subject of a significant controversy [\cite=SS] [\cite=DTSQT] [\cite=Grif] [\cite=Kent] [\cite=Kast] [\cite=reply] [\cite=SHI] [\cite=CO] [\cite=CO-co]. Here we discuss another aspect of such pre- and post-selected particle which makes the claim that such a particle is simultaneously in several places even more robust.

Consider a photon arriving at a screen with N holes (slits) at time t, Fig. 1. We have a single particle (shutter) which, if placed in a slit, prevents the passage of the photon through this slit. Our task is to close all N slits at time t with this single shutter.

We are allowed to perform pre- and post-selection on the shutter: to prepare it at time t1 in state |Ψ1〉 and select it in the state |Ψ2〉 at t2, t1  <  t  <  t2. If the post-selection measurement of |Ψ2〉 fails, the experiment fails, but if it succeeds, we should be able to claim that all N slits were closed for the photon at time t.

If the photon, bouncing of the shutter causes a measurable recoil, then a post-selection can achieve this goal in a trivial way. We just observe the shutter at time t2. If we find a recoil, we may claim that the slits were closed at time t. Indeed, we know that in this case the photon bounced back from the screen. However, in the present work we do not rely on this effect. The setup is such that there is no measurable recoil.

The existence of a solution for this problem is surprising. The probability for the photon to pass through the screen with the shutter in one slit, or in an arbitrary superposition in all N slits, is 1 - 1 / N. Nevertheless, the pre- and post-selected shutter reflects the photon with certainty.

To achieve this task we prepare (pre-select) the shutter at t1 in the state:

[formula]

We post-select the particle at t2 in the state:

[formula]

where |i〉 is a state of a shutter localized in slit i, i = 1,...,N and |N + 1〉 is a state of the shutter localized in some specific different location.

In order to prove our claim, let us consider the time evolution of the quantum state of the shutter and the photon during the whole procedure. We assume that the free evolution of the shutter between t1 and t2 can be neglected. Initially, the photon moves toward N slits, so its state is:

A single photon arrives at N slits, but a single shutter reflects the photon as if there were shutters in every slit.

[formula]

where |i〉ph is the state of a photon moving toward the slit i. Let us signify the state of a photon reflected from slit i as |ĩ〉ph. Then, after t, the time of the interaction between the shutter and the photon, their joint quantum state is:

We can see that all states of the shutter appearing in the second term in the last expression (i.e., all states correlated with a photon which passed through the screen) are orthogonal to the post-selected state |Ψ2〉. Therefore, after the post-selection, the photon state will have only reflected wave components. The screen operates as a perfect mirror; the final state of the photon is:

[formula]

We have shown that a single quantum shutter that has been pre- and post-selected can close any number of slits. It acts on the single photon exactly in the same way as N shutters. Conceptually, using this method one can build the whole screen out of a single pre- and post-selected shutter (particle). This screen will act on a single photon as a real screen made from many particles. In particular, a photon passing through such a screen will follow a corresponding diffraction pattern.

Not less surprising is a "dual" problem which can be solved using our method. We have now N shutters which close at least N - 1 out of the N slits. Nevertheless, we can pre- and post-select the state of these shutters in such a way that a single photon will "see" N open slits.

Consider the pre-selected state of N shutters

[formula]

where |op〉i and |cl〉i are the states of a shutter corresponding to an open or closed slit i respectively. If now we test the number of closed slits, we will find with probability [formula] that all slits are closed, and with probability [formula] that all but one slits are closed. However, we do not test the number of closed slits. We send at time t the photon in an arbitrary state ([\ref=eq:psiPhin]) toward the screen. Then, at time t2, we post-select the shutters in the state:

[formula]

A calculation, identical to the one performed above, shows that a single photon passes the slits without distortion, as if no shutters were present.

In our method a single (pre- and post-selected) shutter closes N slits for a single photon. What will happen if at time t several photons are trying to pass through the slits? If K photons move toward the screen in a particular correlated state

[formula]

then the shutter will reflect with certainty all the photons as it reflected one. However, when the photons arrive in an arbitrary state, we cannot be sure that even one photon will be reflected. Indeed, consider an incoming two-photon state:

[formula]

After the interaction between the shutter and the photons at time t, the state of the shutter correlated with the undisturbed state ([\ref=eq:prod2]) is:

[formula]

This state is not orthogonal to the post-selected state ([\ref=eq:psi2]). Therefore, a successful post-selection is possible when both photons pass through the slits undisturbed, i.e., the two photons might pass through the screen with our pre- and post-selected shutter.

In order to close N slits for a pair of photons we need two pre- and post-selected shutters placed one after the other. The first shutter should be pre-selected at time t1 in the state:

[formula]

and post selected at time t2 in the state:

[formula]

If the two photons pass through two different slits without disturbance, then the state of the shutter will be orthogonal to |Ψ'2〉. Therefore, given a successful post-selection, one photon should be reflected by the first shutter. The second shutter is pre- and post-selected as in previous example, in the states ([\ref=eq:psi1]) and ([\ref=eq:psi2]). This ensures reflection of the second photon.

If the pair of photons pass through the same slit, then the state of the first shutter will not be orthogonal to |Ψ'2〉. Therefore the photons in such a pair might both pass through. But, in this case, the second shutter will reflect both photons with certainty, since it stops any number of photons arriving together as in the correlated state ([\ref=eq:prod]).

In order to stop three photons we have to add another shutter in front of the two described above. The additional shutter should reflect one photon any time three photons arrive at different slits. To this end, the shutter should be pre- and post selected in the states |Ψ''1〉 and |Ψ''2〉:

[formula]

[formula]

The generalization for larger number of photons is obvious. In this way K pre- and post-selected shutters close an arbitrarily large number of slits N for passing K or less photons in an arbitrary state.

In this paper we have shown a surprising feature of pre- and post-selected shutters. A single shutter can close an arbitrary number of slits preventing the passage of a single photon in an arbitrary state, while K shutters can close the slits preventing passage of any number of photons n  ≤  K. On the other hand, N shutters which close at least N - 1 slits can leave all slits open for a single photon.

For a pre- and post-selected state of a single shutter which closes N slits, it was known before [\cite=AV91] that the outcomes of weak measurements performed in all slits correspond to one shutter being in every slit. The present result shows that a measuring device, namely the photon, performing strong measurement while being in a superposition in different slits also indicates the presence of the shutter in every slit.
