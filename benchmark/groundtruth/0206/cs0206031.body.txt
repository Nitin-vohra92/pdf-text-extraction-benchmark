In applications, in particular in finite-element analysis it is useful to have some sufficient conditions for testing invertibility or injectivity of a mapping [formula]. Usually f(  ·  ) is defined on some simple region I, say cube or simplex, in the reference domain. The image f(I) is some region with more complicated geometry (a grid cell) in the physical domain.

In a paper [\cite=Vavasis] S.Vavasis proposed a sufficient condition for global invertibility of a polynomial mapping in [formula]. Here we show that this condition can be more naturally formulated in the framework of nonsmooth analysis (see, e.g. [\cite=Clarke]), and this enables to spread the results of [\cite=Vavasis] and translate them almost word-for-word into a seemingly much more general setting (at least in the linguistic sense). Thus this note may be regarded as a feedback to [\cite=Vavasis].

We need several definitions. The standard reference on nonsmooth analysis is [\cite=Clarke]. Our discussion is restricted to a finite-dimensional case though an essential part of [\cite=Clarke] is devoted to the infinite-dimensional generalizations.

Recall that nonsmooth analysis works with Lipschitz functions that are almost everywhere differentiable. Roughly speaking, the generalized (or Clarke's) gradient ∂F of a Lipschitz function f(  ·  ):Rn  →  R at the point x∈Rn is defined as a convex hull of (almost) all converging sequences of the gradients: [formula], for xi  →  x and f(  ·  ) is differentiable at points xi and the sequence [formula] converges. It is essential that at the points of smoothness of f(  ·  ) the generalized gradient coincides with gradient, and for a convex function-- with its subgradient.

Similarly , the generalized Jacobian ∂F of a Lipschitz mapping F(  ·  ):Rn  →  Rm at the point x is a convex hull of all m  ×  n matrices obtained as limits of sequences JF(xi) (its Jacobian matrix at the point of smoothness xi), where xi  →  x and F(  ·  ) is differentiable at xi.

The generalized Jacobian has maximum rank at point x0 if each matrix from ∂F(x0) has maximum rank.

Nonsmooth inverse function theorem [\cite=Clarke] states that Lipschitz mapping F:Rn  →  Rn, whose generalized Jacobian has maximum rank at point x0 is locally Lipschitz invertible.

In [\cite=Vavasis] S.Vavasis proposed a sufficient condition for the nondegeneracy of a matrix family M consisting of square n  ×  n matrices. To present this result in a slightly more general form we need some (more or less standard) definitions.

A cone [formula] is a set with a property that for all x∈K and for any λ  ≥  0,  λx∈K, i.e. K contains all intersecting rays through the origin.

A cone K is convex if sum of any points of K belongs to K.

A convex cone is polyhedral it can be represented in the form: [formula].

A convex cone K is acute if it contains no nontrivial subspaces or equivalently, if no finite set of elements of K sums to zero.

If [formula] then cone  hull(A) is a union of all rays through the origin intersecting A.

Let formulate Vavasis' condition. Denote by [formula] the set of all i-th columns of the matrices belonging to M and assume that all [formula] are separated from the origin, i.e. for some [formula] (here [formula] denotes the Euclidean norm). Set [formula] and let any cone out of the 2n - 1 cones [formula] be acute.

By definition, V- family is any matrix family satisfying these conditions. It follows from the above that all matrices in V-family are nondegenerate.

If additionally, any cone involved [formula] is contained in a cone [formula] for some certificate vector [formula] and [formula] then such family is defined as strict V-family. In particular, if all Ki (or Ri), [formula] are polyhedral then by Farkas lemma all V-families are strict. Moreover, checking that some matrix family is V-family is reduced to solving 2n - 1 linear programs, and thus the overall test could be performed in linear time with respect to the input in any fixed dimension.

Let [formula] be any Lipschitz mapping defined on the convex reference domain U. If the set of the generalized Jacobians J  =  {J∈∂F(u),  u∈U} forms a strict V-family then F(  ·  ) is globally invertible on U.

Proof. Actually the demonstration is a direct translation into the new setting of the original proof from [\cite=Vavasis].

At first, local invertibility of F(  ·  ) at any point u∈U of the reference domain follows from the nonsmooth inverse function theorem as the generalized Jacobian ∂F(u) has maximum rank at any point by construction.

Secondly, to show global invertibility it is enough to check injectivity of the mapping. Take any different points u,v∈U from the reference domain. By convexity of U and by the nonsmooth analog of the Lagrange formula [\cite=Clarke] for almost all pairs u,v∈U the following equality holds: [formula]. Assume w.l.o.g. that the first coordinate of the vector v - u is nonnegative (otherwise, exchange v and u). Set Ki  =  cone  hull(∂fi(x),  x∈U). Now assume for a moment that v - u  ≥  0. Take the corresponding certificate vector a for the cone [formula]. By construction, for all [formula]. Hence, [formula] [formula] and the injectivity follows. In general case, we take any certificate vector for the cone [formula] with the same sign pattern as the sign pattern of the coordinates of the vector v - u.

Informally, Vavasis sufficiency condition assumes that the columns of the corresponding Jacobian matrices are independent and thus may be extremely restrictive but, on the other hand, it has attractive enough decomposition feature. Namely, let the reference domain I be subdivided into several simple regions, say, I is a cube that is partitioned into parallelepipedal patches [formula] by several axis- parallel hyperplanes. Now let [formula] be any Lipschitz mapping. Let [formula] (the union of all generalized Jacobians in the closure of the patch Ii). Obviously these sets can be computed separately for any closed patch [formula]. As above we obtain the following sufficient condition: if each of the sets [formula] forms a strict V-family and there exists a certificate vector common to all Δi then the mapping F(  ·  ) is globally invertible. Equivalently, as Vavasis condition is insensible to taking convex hulls, F(  ·  ) is globally invertible on I if the set [formula] forms a strict V-family.

For a simple example, assume that F(  ·  ) is a continuous piecewise polynomial (product) Bernstein-Bezier (BB) mapping as proposed in [\cite=Vavasis] , i.e. in any patch [formula] the mapping is given by

[formula]

where [formula] are local coordinates in [formula] and the vectors [formula] are called the control points. It is well known that the image F(Iq) of BB mapping is contained in the convex hull of the control points. It is also well known that the partial derivatives of F(  ·  ) can be put into BB form (and the resulting control points for the derivatives are effectively computable linear combinations of the control points for F(  ·  )). Thus for any [formula] the set of all i-th columns of the Jacobian matrices JF(Iq) = {JF(x),  x∈Iq} is contained in some explicitly computable polytope Pqi. Hence, all possible i-th columns of the Jacobian matrices JF(x),  x∈I are contained in [formula]. (Here we use the continuity of F(  ·  ) as at any point belonging to the intersection of some patches [formula] the generalized Jacobian JF(x) is by construction contained in [formula].) Thus if the matrix family P, whose i-th column belongs to [formula], form a strict V-family then F(  ·  ) is globally invertible on the whole domain I.

Here we show that invertibility test in [\cite=Vavasis] is valid for a much more ample class of mappings and thus should be simultaneously robust and restrictive enough. Therefore it would be nice if some new arguments would be applied to the invertibility problem even in the simplest case of bilinear polynomials.
