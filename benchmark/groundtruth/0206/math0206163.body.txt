A new notion of transitivity for groups and sets of permutations

Introduction

Throughout, let n  ≥  2 be an integer and let [formula]. Suppose that G is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn. Recall that G is t-transitive if it is transitive on ordered t-tuples of distinct elements of Ω. It is trivial to see that if G is t-transitive, then it is (t - 1)-transitive. Similarly, G is t-homogeneous if it is transitive on t-element subsets of Ω. The following is one of the main theorems in a paper of Livingstone and Wagner.

Let G  ≤  Sn be t-homogeneous where t  ≤  n / 2. Then G is also (t - 1)-homogeneous.

Our goal is to define a more general notion of transitivity so that both the t-transitive and t-homogeneous results will be special cases. To this end, let an ordered set partition of Ω be an ordered tuple

[formula]

of pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets of Ω whose union is Ω. These partitions are also called tabloids and play an important role in the representation theory of Sn [\cite=jameskerber] [\cite=sagan]. We will only need to consider the case where |Pi|  ≥  |Pi + 1| for all 1  ≤  i  <  k. On the other hand, an (integer) partition λ of n, written |λ| = n, is a sequence

[formula]

of positive integers whose sum is n and satisfying the monotonicity condition

[formula]

The λi are called the parts of λ. The shape of the set partition P is the integer partition

[formula]

Let λ be a fixed partition of n. A subgroup G of [formula] is said to be λ-transitive if it is transitive on partitions P of shape λ. Equivalently, for any two set partitions P and Q with |P| = |Q| = λ, there exists g∈G taking P to Q in the sense that

[formula]

(as a set) for each i, 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. This definition includes that of a t-transitive permutation group (use [formula]) and that of a t-homogeneous permutation group (use λ = (n - t,t)).

We extend this definition to arbitrary sets of permutations as follows. For D  ⊆  Sn and λ a partition of n, we say that D is λ-transitive if there is a constant [formula] such that, for any two set partitions P and Q of shape λ, D contains exactly [formula] permutations g taking P to Q. We will also use the terminology "t-transitive," respectively "t-homogeneous," for sets of permutations which are [formula]-transitive, respectively (n - t,t)-transitive.

The following two propositions follow directly from the definitions.

If G  ≤  Sn is a λ-transitive group of permutations acting on Ωn, then G is also λ-transitive as a set.

If D  ⊆  Sn is a λ-transitive set of permutations acting on Ωn and G = 〈D〉 is the subgroup generated by D, then G is a λ-transitive group.

Each set partition P determines a Young subgroup Y = YP which consists of the set of permutations of Ω which fix each subset Pi of P setwise. We say Y has shape λ where λ = |P|. There is a bijection between all set partitions of shape λ and all left cosets of YP that preserves the action of Sn. Using this observation, it is easy to prove the following characterization of λ-transitivity.

Suppose |λ| = n and D  ⊆  Sn. Then D is λ-transitive if and only if there is a constant [formula] such that for any coset gYP of any Young subgroup of shape λ we have [formula].

The last definition that will be necessary to understand our generalization of the Livingstone-Wagner Theorem and (t-transitivity result) is that of the dominance order on integer partitions. If |λ| = |μ| = n then λ is dominated by μ, written [formula], if and only if

[formula]

where we define λi = 0 if i is greater than the number of parts in λ and similarly for μ. We will give two proofs that if [formula] then λ-transitivity implies μ-transitivity, from which Theorem [\ref=lwth] follows immediately. The first, which is just for groups but also includes a stronger result about orbits, is essentially a generalization of the one given by Livingstone and Wagner themselves. The second proof holds for all λ-transitive sets D. But if D is not a group then it does not have orbits and so a combinatorial approach is needed in this case.

The group case

Let the permutation group G act on two sets S and T with characters χ and ψ, respectively. The inequality χ  ≥  ψ means that χ  =  ψ  +  φ where φ is some character of G. Equivalently, if [formula] are the irreducible characters of G and we write [formula] for nonnegative integers ci,di then χ  ≥  ψ if and only if ci  ≥  di for all i. We will also need the notation

[formula]

Let G be a permutation group acting on sets S and T with characters χ and ψ, respectively. If χ  ≥  ψ then

[formula]

Taking inner products with the trivial character and using χ  =  ψ  +  φ, we have

[formula]

We now apply this lemma to the situation at hand. Let P be any set partition of shape λ and let [formula] denote the set of all left cosets of the Young subgroup YP. Of course, [formula] depends on P and not just λ, but that fact will not play a role in the following theorem.

If G  ≤  Sn then

[formula]

Let χ and ψ be the characters of G acting on [formula] and Sμ, respectively. Then by the previous lemma, it suffices to show that χ  ≥  μ. Let P and Q be ordered set partitions giving rise to the sets [formula] and Sμ, respectively. Then χ and ψ are the restrictions to G of the characters [formula] and [formula], respectively, so we are reduced to showing χ'  ≥  ψ'. But then by Young's Rule

[formula]

where χν is the irreducible character of Sn corresponding to ν and Kνλ is a Kostka number. However, it is known [\cite=lv:opc] [\cite=white] that if [formula] then Kνλ  ≥  Kνμ for all ν. This finishes the proof.

As an immediate corollary, we get our first generalization of the Livingstone-Wagner Theorem.

If G  ≤  Sn is λ-transitive and [formula] then G is μ-transitive.

The center of the group algebra and the inner distribution

Our main tool for extracting information about λ-transitive sets will be the center of the group algebra of the symmetric group Sn, specifically in the form arising from the left regular representation g  ↦  A(g) (over the reals). We will denote this commutative algebra of symmetric matrices by [formula] and its dimension by p(n), the number of partitions of the integer n. One may learn quite a bit about this algebra via the character theory of the symmetric group; see references [\cite=banito] [\cite=jameskerber] [\cite=sagan]. We identify two distinguished bases of [formula] as follows. The first basis contains one matrix for each conjugacy class Cα, namely

[formula]

The second distinguished basis is the basis of primitive idempotents for the center. This basis contains one element, Eμ say, for each irreducible representation of Sn. The two bases are related by the equations

[formula]

where fμ is the degree of the irreducible representation ρμ and χμα is the value taken by the corresponding irreducible character on the conjugacy class Cα [\cite=banito].

The matrices in [formula] are clearly simultaneously diagonalizable. The eigenspace of [formula] indexed by μ is the column space of Eμ:

[formula]

The dimension of Vμ is f2μ.

Let D be a non-empty subset of Sn and let x  =  xD denote the indicator vector of D. This is a 01-vector of length n! with x(g)  =  1 if and only if g∈D. The inner distribution of D is the rational vector of length p(n) with α entry equal to

[formula]

The dual distribution of D is the vector b with entries indexed by irreducible representations and defined by

[formula]

Since each Eμ is positive semi-definite, we have b  ≥  0 and bμ = 0 if and only if Eμx  =  0. And since Eμ is the matrix representing orthogonal projection onto Vμ we have another equivalent condition, namely bμ = 0 if and only if [formula].

For arbitrary D, the quantities aα and bμ have alternative expressions as follows:

[formula]

and

[formula]

When D is a group, these simplify to

[formula]

and

[formula]

The set case

Suppose D is a coset of a Young subgroup of shape λ and b is the dual distribution of D. Then bμ  ≠  0 if and only if [formula].

Because of equation ([\ref=Ebmu]), we may assume D is a Young subgroup. In this case, by Young's rule and ([\ref=Ebmugp]), the number bμ is a non-zero multiple of the Kostka number Kμλ.

Let Yλ denote the incidence matrix of Sn versus cosets of Young subgroups of shape λ. The n! rows of Yλ are indexed by permutations and the columns are indexed by all left cosets hYP of all Young subgroups of shape λ. In the entry indexed (g,hYP), we have a 1 if g∈hYP and a 0 otherwise.

Let [formula] be the column space of [formula]. Then

[formula]

This space is invariant under the left action of the group algebra. So, in particular, it is [formula] invariant and thus a sum of eigenspaces. Combining this with the previous lemma yields the desired result.

Let D be a set of permutations in Sn and λ a partition of n. Then D is λ-transitive if and only if for every μ with [formula] we have bμ = 0.

We prove the forward implication noting that the converse follows by reversing the steps of the proof.

>From Corollary [\ref=CSlambda], the eigenspaces which appear in Wλ are precisely those Vμ for which [formula]. Now if x denotes the indicator vector of D, then by Lemma [\ref=Ltransiffdesign] we have [formula] where [formula] stands for the all ones vector of appropriate length. Let x0 denote the projection of x onto Wλ. Note that x, and thus x0, has the same inner products with columns of [formula] as does the vector [formula] where P is of shape λ. So the same will be true for products with the vectors from any orthonormal basis B for Wλ. It follows that x0 is equal to a multiple of the all ones vector. Since x0∈V(n), we have [formula] for all μ such that [formula] and hence the theorem.

An immediate corollary of this result is our second generalization of the Livingstone-Wagner Theorem.

If the set D is λ-transitive and [formula], then D is μ-transitive.

We get a second corollary of Theorem [\ref=Tmain] by combining it with equation ([\ref=Ebmu]).

The set D is λ-transitive if and only if

[formula]

for each μ such that [formula].

Examples

>From Theorem [\ref=TGlamu], we know that a λ-transitive group of permutations is t-homogeneous where [formula]. Thus we are severely restricted in our search for λ-transitive groups. Other than alternating and symmetric groups, there are no t-homogeneous groups for t  ≥  6. (This is a consequence of the classification of finite simple groups; see [\cite=dm] or [\cite=handbk].) There are precisely two non-trivial 5-transitive groups: the Mathieu groups M12 and M24. Of course, a t-transitive group is λ-transitive for any partition λ refined by [formula]. So we seek t-homogeneous groups which fail to be t-transitive. Livingstone and Wagner [\cite=livwag] showed that there are no such groups for t  ≥  5. The balance of the following result is due to Kantor [\cite=kantor] who dealt with the cases t = 2,3,4.

Suppose G is a permutation group acting t-homogeneously on n points (t  ≤  n / 2), but not t-transitively. Then one of the following is the case:

In all cases, the group acts (t - 1)-transitively.

For each group appearing in this theorem, we wish to determine its full level of transitivity. (For t = 2, there is no partition between (n - 2,2) and (n - 2,1,1) to consider.)

For PSL2(q) acting on the projective line (q + 1 points), we find the stabilizer of a 3-set has size three. Since the action is faithful, we conclude that PSL2(q) acts (n - 3,2,1)-transitively on the projective line. It follows that this is also the full degree of transitivity of PΣL2(q) and any group between the two.

AGL1(8) has order 56, so this group acts sharply 3-homogeneously on [formula].

AΓL1(8) acts faithfully on [formula] with three group elements stabilizing any 3-set. So this action is (5,2,1)-transitive.

AΓL1(32) has order 4960, so this group acts sharply 3-homogeneously on [formula].

Finally, we consider the groups with t = 4. First, PGL2(8) has 504 elements and acts faithfully on PG(1,8) with the stabilizer of any 4-set being isomorphic to the Klein four-group, so it is (5,3,1)-transitive in this action.

PΓL2(8) has 1512 elements and acts 4-homogeneously on nine points. The stabilizer of a 4-set has size 12, and thus is isomorphic to A4. Hence this group is (5,2,1,1)-transitive.

For PΓL2(32), the stabilizer of a 4-set is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, so the action is (29,3,1)-transitive.

We note that, in 1975, Peter Neumann [\cite=neumann] gave a classification scheme for t-homogeneous groups which are not fully t-transitive in terms of the isomorphism type of the stabilizer of a t-set. In Neumann's language, a group which acts almost generously 3-transitively is one in which the stabilizer of any 4-set contains A4. (He does not presume a 4-homogeneous action in this definition.) Clearly a group acting 4-homogeneously has this property exactly when it is (n - 4,2,1,1)-transitive. Neumann calls a permutation group a little generously 3-transitive if the stabilizer of any 4-set contains the Klein four-group. Observe that a group acting 4-homogeneously and having this property will be (n - 4,3,1)-transitive. Since there are no 4-homogeneous groups with cyclic stabilizer of a 4-set, the converse is true as well. But this observation hinges on Kantor's result.

We now construct a family of λ-transitive sets of permutations for partitions λ having the property that any λ-transitive group must be strictly larger than the set we construct.

[\cite=bieredel] For q an odd prime power, the affine group AGL1(q) acts 2-transitively on [formula]. There can be no 2-homogeneous group of size [formula] but there is such a set of permutations. Choose a subset S of [formula] such that S is disjoint from - S and [formula]. (Since q is odd, this is always possible.) Let

[formula]

We claim that this set is (q - 2,2)-transitive. For if the mapping x  ↦  ax + b takes u to y and v to z, then the mapping which takes u to z and v to y (in AGL1(q)) is x  ↦  ( - a)x + b' for some b'. Thus no two elements of D take an unordered pair {u,v} to the same image.

A recursive construction

In this section, we show that, given any partition λ of a positive integer, m say, if we are permitted to increase the largest part (thus obtaining a partition λ' of some integer n  ≥  m), we can construct a λ'-transitive set of permutations D which is "small" in comparison to |Sn|.

Suppose the following three structures are given:

>From these, we will construct a t-transitive set D of permutations inside Sn.

We first define a number of bijections. Let

[formula]

via j  ↦  j - k. For each block b∈B, choose bijections

[formula]

and

[formula]

which will remain fixed.

With the above notation, the set of functions

[formula]

is a t-transitive set of permutations in Sn.

Suppose t = 2, n = 7, k = 3 and the blocks are those of the Fano plane

[formula]

D1 = S3 and D2 = A4. We then obtain a 2-transitive set of 7.6.12 = 504 permutations in S7. For instance, if b = {3,4,6} and Ω - b = {5,7,1,2} (listed in the order induced by φb and ψb) and π  =  (12), σ = (13)(24), the resulting permutation in D is

[formula]

The following notation will be required in the proof of this lemma. Suppose I and O are disjoint subsets of Ω. We would like to count blocks b∈B which contain all of the points in I yet none of the points in O. If |I| = i and |O| = j and i + j  ≤  t, then there exists a constant νi,j such that there exactly νi,j blocks b such that I  ⊆  b and [formula] [\cite=handbk].

Suppose that h  ≤  t. If [formula] are distinct elements of Ωk and [formula] are distinct elements of Ωk, then there are exactly ch permutations π∈D1 such that πaj  =  bj for all 1  ≤  j  ≤  h for some constant ch. Similarly, there exist constants [formula] associated to D2.

Proof of Lemma 5. Let [formula] be distinct elements of Ω and let [formula] be distinct elements of Ω. If a1  >  k, set i = 0; otherwise, let i be the largest integer such that ai  ≤  k and set j = t - i. There are νi,j blocks b of the design (Ω,B) for which [formula] and [formula]. There are ci permutations π∈D1 taking [formula] to [formula] for [formula]. There are dj permutations σ in D2 taking [formula] to [formula] for [formula]. Thus there are

[formula]

permutations ρ∈D satisfying [formula] for all [formula]. To finish the proof, we simply must show that this quantity r does not depend on i. But we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

giving us

[formula]

Moreover, it is obvious that ci  =  ci + 1(k - i) and dj - 1  =  dj(n - k - j + 1). Putting these identities together, we find that

[formula]

which completes our proof.

We will now make use of the following result:

Given integers t and n with

[formula]

and n  ≥  t + 1 > 0, there exists a t-(n,t + 1,(t + 1)!2t + 1) design without repeated blocks.

Using these designs in the previous construction, we obtain the following asymptotic existence theorem.

Let [formula] be a non-increasing sequence of positive integers and let ε  >  0. Then there exist infinitely many values for λ1  ≥  λ2 such that there exists a λ-transitive set D of permutations inside Sn ([formula]) having |D| / n!  <  ε.

It suffices to prove this for [formula]. Let k = t + 1 and choose n  ≥  2t + 1 to satisfy Teirlinck's theorem. Then there exists a block design B on n points with each t-set appearing in exactly (t + 1)!2t + 1 blocks. Using St + 1 and Sn - t - 1 as our component t-transitive permutation sets, we obtain a t-transitive set D of permutations in Sn with

[formula]

that is, |D|  =  K  ·  n!  /  (n - t) where K  =  (t + 1)!2t + 1. With t fixed, we see that

[formula]

A split basis for the association scheme of the symmetric group

We now turn our attention to the association scheme of the symmetric group. The center [formula] of the group algebra of Sn is a vector space of symmetric matrices closed under both ordinary matrix multiplication and under Schur (entrywise) multiplication and containing both I and the all-ones matrix J. In other words, [formula] is a Bose-Mesner algebra. The underlying association scheme has Sn as its vertex set and contains one graph Γα for each conjugacy class Cα: two permutations g and h are adjacent in Γα if gh- 1∈Cα. The adjacency matrix of Γα is the matrix Aα introduced in Section [\ref=Sec:center]. The basis of primitive central idempotents Eμ was introduced earlier as well.

In the study of association schemes, one often chooses a base point from the vertex set and considers the trivial module [formula] where [formula] is the elementary basis vector associated to the base point. If we choose the identity permutation as our base point and use the corresponding elementary basis vector [formula], then the trivial module [formula] for [formula] acting on [formula] is simply the vector space of class functions. The trivial module has two distinguished bases: the indicator functions [formula] for the conjugacy classes Cα and the irreducible characters [formula]. We found earlier that this module alone was sufficient for the study of λ-transitive groups. Yet, to extend the results to arbitrary sets of permutations, we found it necessary to appeal to the coding theorist's inner distribution and dual distribution. This is, in effect, a smoothing technique in which we average over all base points g∈Sn in order to account for the possible asymmetry of a set D.

Consider the set P of all cosets of Young subgroups of Sn partially ordered by inclusion. We partition the elements of this poset into fibers corresponding to the shape of the coset gYP. The matrix Yλ introduced in Section [\ref=Sec:setcase] is then the incidence matrix between the minimal elements (singletons) of this poset and the elements in the fiber indexed by λ. We are interested in the matrices [formula] where λ is a partition of n.

The set [formula] is a basis for [formula]. The change-of-basis equations with respect to the Aα have the form

[formula]

with mλ,λ > 0. The change-of-basis equations with respect to the Eμ have the form

[formula]

with nλ,μ  ≠  0 for all [formula].

Since the entry of Cλ in row a column b is equal to the number of cosets hYP of Young subgroups of shape λ containing both a and b, we clearly have A(g)- 1CλA(g)  =  Cλ for any g∈Sn showing that Cλ lies in [formula]. Next, note that the column space of Cλ is equal to that of Yλ so that, by Corollary [\ref=CSlambda], nλ,μ  ≠  0 if [formula] and nλ,μ = 0 otherwise. So the matrices Cλ indeed form a basis for [formula].

Now consider the coefficients mλ,α. The (a,b)-entry of Cλ is non-zero if and only if there is some coset of some Young subgroup of shape λ which contains both a and b. Equivalently, ab- 1 is an element of that Young subgroup. But the conjugacy classes [formula] which intersect a Young subgroup of shape λ are precisely those for which α is a refinement of λ. So by definition of [formula], [formula] with strict inequality precisely when α refines λ. The Theorem now follows since refinement implies [formula] and because λ refines itself.

Following Terwilliger [\cite=itotanter] [\cite=ter2] [\cite=ter24], we call the basis [formula] a split basis for the association scheme of Sn. We remark, however, that the typical linear ordering on relations and primitive idempotents is replaced in this case by the partial order [formula].

In the language of association schemes, a λ-transitive set D is the same as a Delsarte T-design [\cite=delthesis] where [formula]. This provides another viewpoint for our investigation and suggests an avenue for finding future non-existence results. We remark that Delsarte's linear programming bound -- the most obvious technique in this regard -- is mostly ineffective in this particular setting, being overshadowed by the following more elementary divisibility conditions on λ-transitive sets.

If D  ⊆  Sn is a λ-transitive set of permutations, then |D| is divisible by [formula] for any partition [formula].

Since D must also be μ-transitive by Theorem [\ref=TDlamu], each coset of each Young subgroup of shape μ contains rμ permutations from D for some integer rμ. Given a fixed YP of shape μ, it has [formula] cosets which partition Sn and thus D. So [formula].

Open questions

We list here some open questions raised by our work in the hopes that the reader will be tempted to work on them.

(1) An interesting construction is given in [\cite=conway] for a set of 13! / 7! permutation in S13 which Conway calls M13. While this set is six-transitive in the sense of [\cite=conway], it is not (7,1,1,1,1,1,1)-transitive in the sense we are using in this paper. We were unable to compute the full degree of transitivity of this set due to its size. We also ask if M13 can be combined with some small collection of its translates to yield a 6-transitive set of permutations in S13.

(2) Is there an analogue of λ-transitive groups and sets for other Coxeter groups? In particular, it would be interesting to investigate the hyperoctahedral group. One would hope that there is a generalization of Theorem [\ref=TDlamu] in this setting.

(3) In view of Proposition [\ref=Pdivis], no λ-transitive subset of Sn can contain less than [formula] permutations. Trivial examples where this lower bound is achieved are the cyclic, alternating and symmetric groups. At the end of Section [\ref=Sec:eg], we presented examples achieving this lower bound for λ = (q - 2,2) where q is an odd prime power. We ask if there are any other infinite families of examples achieving this lower bound.

(4) The Krein parameters qνλ,μ of the association scheme of the symmetric group are defined by the equations

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the entrywise product of matrices. In the study of association schemes, one is often interested in determining which Krein parameters vanish for a given family of schemes. While this question is known to be hard in general, we identify one interesting result along these lines. Using Theorem 2.9.22 on p99 of the book by James and Kerber [\cite=jameskerber], we find that the Krein parameter qνλ,μ vanishes if [formula] where [formula].
