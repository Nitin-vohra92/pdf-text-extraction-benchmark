A theoretical framework is introduced that describes possible CPT-violating effects in the context of quantum electrodynamics. Experiments comparing the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the positron can place tight limits on CPT violation. The conventional figure of merit adopted in these experiments, involving the difference between the corresponding g factors, is shown to provide a misleading measure of the precision of CPT limits. We introduce an alternative figure of merit, comparable to one commonly used in CPT tests with neutral mesons. To measure it, a straightforward extension of current experimental procedures is proposed. With current technology, a CPT bound better than about one part in 1020 is attainable.

The CPT theorem [\cite=pct] is a powerful result holding for local relativistic quantum field theories of point particles in flat spacetime. It states that such theories must be invariant under the combined operations of charge conjugation C, parity reversal P, and time reversal T. Among the implications of the theorem are the equality of particle and antiparticle masses and lifetimes.

Invariance under CPT has been tested in a variety of experiments [\cite=pdg]. The tightest bound published to date arises from experiments with the neutral kaon system [\cite=expt1], where the CPT figure of merit

[formula]

is known to be smaller than two parts in 1018. This remarkable precision is possible because neutral-kaon oscillations provide a natural interferometer with dimensionless sensitivity controlled by the mass difference between the physical KL and KS states: |(mL  -  mS) / mK|≃10- 14. The quoted precision for rK is thus attained via measurements with a precision of about one part in 104.

Atomic experiments have also confirmed CPT symmetry. High-precision comparisons of the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and positron currently provide the most stringent bounds on CPT violation in lepton systems [\cite=vd]. Denote the electron and positron g factors by g- and g+, respectively. Then, a conventional figure of merit used in these experiments is [\cite=pdg]

[formula]

which is known to be smaller than two parts in 1012. The experiments confine isolated single electrons or positrons in a Penning trap for indefinite periods [\cite=vd] [\cite=geo] and measure their cyclotron and anomaly frequencies to a precision of better than one part in 108. These frequencies can be combined to determine (g - 2), which is of order 10- 3, and hence to yield the limit on rg.

The figure of merit rg is poorer than rK by about six orders of magnitude, even though the experimental measurements involved in the (g - 2) experiments are about four orders of magnitude sharper. This discrepancy originates in the difference between the quantities entering the dimensionless figures of merit. One is a mass (energy) difference while the other is a coupling difference. Indeed, all CPT tests to date have looked for differences between particles and antiparticle masses, lifetimes, or couplings. An important limiting factor in comparing bounds from various systems and in establishing new tests has been the absence of a theoretical framework for describing possible CPT violation.

The combination of the theoretical proof of CPT invariance in conventional field theory and high-precision tests in experiments has triggered investigations of possible CPT violation as a candidate signature for new physics beyond the standard model, such as string theory [\cite=kp1]. The current bounds in the kaon system are close to the scale of suppressed CPT violation possibly arising in strings [\cite=kp1] [\cite=kp2], and new tests in other neutral-meson systems are feasible with analysis of existing data or in planned experiments [\cite=kp2] [\cite=ckv]. There are also possible implications for baryogenesis [\cite=bckp].

Motivated by these ideas, a theoretical framework for the treatment of possible CPT and Lorentz violations at the level of the standard SU(3) ×   SU(2) ×   U(1) model has recently been developed [\cite=cptsm]. Within this framework, a general CPT- and Lorentz-violating extension to the standard model has been presented that appears to maintain desirable features of the quantum field theory, including gauge invariance, naive power-counting renormalizability, and microscopic causality. Possible CPT violations are controlled by parameters with values to be bounded by experiment.

The existence of this model suggests a variety of experimental approaches to testing CPT and makes possible a quantitative comparison of various figures of merit. In the present work, we consider a restriction of the model to quantum electrodynamics to investigate tests of CPT using the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and positron. In what follows, we use this model to show that the conventional figure of merit rg adopted in (g - 2) experiments is a misleading measure of CPT bounds in lepton systems. Instead, an alternative CPT figure of merit is introduced, and its value within our model is obtained. A straightforward experimental procedure to measure it is proposed, and an estimate is given of the likely resulting CPT bound.

In the present context, the dominant CPT-breaking terms from the model act to modify the Dirac equation. In natural units (c  =  1), the result is

[formula]

where ψ is the electron-positron field, Aμ is the photon field, e is the electron charge, and m is its mass. The eight quantities aμ and bμ are (small) real constants that are invariant under CPT transformations and act as effective coupling constants. The standard CPT-transformation properties of ψ can be used to show that the terms involving aμ and bμ break CPT. These features and Eq. ([\ref=mdeq]) largely suffice to develop the results in the present work. Various issues concerning other symmetry transformations (including rotational and boost properties) and more general extensions of quantum electrodynamics are treated in Ref. [\cite=cptsm] but are not directly relevant here.

In (g - 2) experiments, the leading contributions to the energy spectrum originate in the particle interaction with the constant magnetic field of the Penning trap. The quadrupole electric field and other fields produce lesser effects. Since any possible CPT violation must be small, it suffices to work within a perturbative framework using relativistic quantum mechanics. The field ψ can thus be regarded as a Dirac wave function for an electron, and Aμ can be treated as a background electromagnetic potential. We denote by Ĥ-0 the conventional Dirac hamiltonian operator for an electron in the potential Aμ for a constant magnetic field, including an anomaly term. The exact eigenenergies of Ĥ-0 are the usual Landau levels, and the eigensolutions can be used as the basis for perturbative calculations. In the presence of the CPT-violating terms given in Eq. ([\ref=mdeq]), the modified Dirac hamiltonian for the electron wave function is Ĥ-  =  Ĥ-0  +  Ĥ-int, where

[formula]

The wave function for a positron can be found using charge conjugation. Typically, experiments on positrons are performed in Penning traps with the same magnetic fields as used for electron experiments, with only the electric field changing polarity. We therefore solve for the positron wave function in the same field Aμ as for the electron. In the present case, this implies the usual Dirac hamiltonian Ĥ+0 for a positron is the same as Ĥ-0 except that the coefficient of Aμ changes sign. Using the charge conjugation transformation, the CPT-violating perturbation for the positron is found to be

[formula]

In investigating CPT-violating effects, it is unnecessary to include all possible perturbations that are relevant to (g - 2) experiments. For example, the effects of the magnetron and axial motions and the usual higher-order relativistic corrections are all described within conventional Dirac theory and are the same for electrons and positrons. It therefore suffices to work with the electron and positron theories described by H±0. The point is that all perturbative corrections except those involving aμ and bμ vanish when the electron and positron energies are subtracted. Moreover, any interactions involving the coupling of aμ and bμ to other perturbative terms are of higher order and therefore can be neglected.

In what follows, we denote the relativistic electron and positron Landau-level wave functions by ψ-n,s and ψ+n,s, respectively. The corresponding lowest-order eigenenergies are denoted E-n,s and E+n,s, where [formula] labels the level number and s =   ±  1 labels the spin. In the electron case the spin-up and spin-down states form two ladders of levels, for which the spin-down states with given n = n0 > 0 are almost degenerate with the spin-up states with n = n0 - 1. The degeneracy is broken due to the anomalous magnetic moment. A similar situation holds for the positron case, except that the spin labels are reversed. The lowest-order cyclotron and anomaly frequencies ω-c and ω-a for the electron and the corresponding frequencies ω+c and ω+a for the positron can be expressed in terms of the lowest eigenenergies as

[formula]

We orient our coordinate system so that the magnetic field [formula] lies along the positive z axis, and we choose the gauge Aμ  =  (0, - yB,0,0). The lowest-order CPT-violating corrections to the electron energies from Ĥ-int then are

[formula]

where [formula] is the third component of the momentum. For the positron, we find a similar expression but with the replacements aμ  →   - aμ, E-n,  ±  1  →  E+n,  ±  1, and ±  1  →    ∓  1 in the numerator of the third term.

At first sight, it might appear from these equations that both aμ and bμ have physically observable consequences. However, the corrections due to aμ correspond to a redefinition of the zero of the energy and momentum, E  →  E  -  a0 and [formula], in the dispersion relation for [formula]. The corresponding shifts for positrons would have opposite signs for aμ. Although the electron and positron four-momentum shifts are of opposite signs, they cannot be detected in (g - 2) experiments because the double tower of states in each case is shifted so that all level spacings are constant. The cyclotron and anomaly frequencies remain unchanged for both cases, and hence aμ has no observable effect [\cite=fn1]. Without loss of generality, we can therefore set aμ to zero in what follows.

For Penning-trap configurations typically used in (g - 2) experiments, the axial momentum replaces pz. Since the energy of the axial motion is several orders of magnitude smaller than E-n,s, the terms in Eq. ([\ref=delE]) involving the product of b0 with pz / E±n,s can safely be neglected provided the ratio b0 / b3 is not too large [\cite=fn2]. For the typical magnetic fields of B≃5 T, |eB|  /  m2≃10- 9, so the correction terms involving the product of b3 with |eB| can also be ignored. The dominant CPT-violating contributions therefore depend only on b3. It follows that there are no corrections to the cyclotron frequencies, while the electron and positron anomaly frequencies shift by - 2b3 and 2b3, respectively. This gives

[formula]

The leading-order signal for CPT breaking in Penning-trap (g - 2) experiments with fixed magnetic field is therefore a difference between the electron and positron anomaly frequencies. Note that the signature ([\ref=signal]) for CPT violation is sensitive only to the spatial components of [formula] in the direction of [formula]. However, since the relative directions of the two vectors can be probed experimentally, for example by changing the orientation of [formula] or by performing measurements at different times, bounds on the different spatial components of [formula] are in principle accessible.

At this point, we can address the issue of the appropriateness of the figure of merit rg given in Eq. ([\ref=rg]) as a suitable measure of CPT violation. Recall that the g factor of an elementary particle is essentially the strength of the gyromagnetic ratio, which is the ratio of the magnitudes of the magnetic moment and the angular momentum. Conventional quantum electrodynamics for an electron in a Penning trap predicts (g - 2)  =  2ωa  /  ωc, and CPT invariance predicts g-  =  g+. The latter relation holds to within the measurement accuracy of two parts in 1012. It therefore appears tempting to use the figure of merit rg of Eq. ([\ref=rg]) as a measure of CPT violation. However, within our framework, CPT is broken without affecting the electron or positron gyromagnetic ratios. This means that the theoretical value of rg is zero even though CPT is broken.

One might be tempted to fix this problem by adopting as fundamental the conventional experimentally based definition, [formula], where ωa and ωc are experimental frequencies. This definition of g would make rg nonzero if CPT is violated, but it would be different from the theoretical definition based on the gyromagnetic ratio. Moreover, rg would then depend on the field B and might not be well defined. For example, our result ([\ref=signal]) means that rg would become rg  =  |Δωa  /  ωava|  ≈  |4b3  /  ω-a|, which diverges in the weak-field limit B  →  0. This provides an explicit counterexample to the thesis that rg is a suitable CPT figure of merit.

A more appropriate figure of merit can be introduced theoretically in a general context as the ratio of a CPT-violating electron-positron energy-level difference and the basic energy scale:

[formula]

taken as usual in the weak-field, zero-momentum limit. Here, E-n,s and E+n,s denote energy eigenvalues for the full Penning-trap hamiltonians. Within our particular framework E-n,s  →  m in this limit, and the difference of energies in the numerator becomes half the difference between the two measured anomaly frequencies, Δωa / 2  ≈   - 2b3, independent of n and s. Thus, in our model the definition ([\ref=ratio]) reduces to [formula]. This shows that, unlike the conventional quantity rg, the figure of merit re is a well defined measure of CPT violation. Moreover, since it is a ratio of energies, it is comparable to the measure rK in Eq. ([\ref=rK]) conventionally used for CPT tests with the neutral-kaon system.

Within the framework of scenarios involving spontaneous CPT and Lorentz breaking from a higher-dimensional fundamental model such as a string theory [\cite=kp1] [\cite=kp2] [\cite=ks], the natural suppression scale for CPT violation is the ratio of a light scale ml to a large (Planck or compactification) scale M. It is therefore plausible that re  ≈  ml / M. Some intuition as to the range of possible values for re can be found by choosing various values for ml. If ml  ≈  m and taking M  ≈  MPlanck, we find re≃5  ×  10- 23. If instead ml≃250 GeV, which is of order of the electroweak scale, then re≃2  ×  10- 17.

We have seen that any existing CPT violation generated by [formula] would induce a potentially measurable shift between the energy levels of electrons and positrons in a Penning trap. Indeed, the ratio re could be bounded in experiments using current techniques. We have investigated several possible experimental procedures that could be adopted. The most effective one would involve taking advantage of the predicted vanishing of the difference Δωc in the electron and positron cyclotron frequencies. Since ω∓a both depend on the magnitude of the magnetic field, it would be important to maintain the calibration of B in the measurements of Δωa. This could be accomplished by using the equality of the cyclotron frequencies to verify that the magnetic field remains the same for both electrons and positrons. The ratio re could then be obtained from measurements of Δωa at equal values of the magnetic field. These measurements could be repeated using different values of the magnetic field to verify that Δωa is independent of the magnitude B for a fixed orientation of the field axis. Since the Penning trap configuration selects the component of [formula] in the direction of [formula], an additional check would involve looking for diurnal variations in the difference Δωa.

We can estimate the bound on re that could be attained. Suppose the angular anomaly frequencies can be measured to an accuracy of approximately 10 Hz. This would seem feasible, for example, using the line-fitting procedure described in Ref. [\cite=vd]. At the same time, the equality of the cyclotron frequencies would have to be maintained to an accuracy of one part in 108 to account for possible drifts in the magnetic field. Using Eq. ([\ref=signal]), b3  =    -  Δωa  /  4. Assuming no differences in the angular frequency are observed to this level of precision, then the bound [formula] eV can be obtained. This corresponds to a CPT figure of merit of [formula] in the electron-positron sector.

This estimate suggests a somewhat tighter bound for re would be attainable than that for the corresponding figure of merit rK arising from experiments with the neutral-kaon system. However, performing the latter tests would continue to be essential because neutral-meson CPT violation is controlled by distinct CPT-violating parameters appearing in the quark sector. In any event, a bound of the estimated magnitude for re in the electron-positron sector would be in line with the greater precision that is experimentally accessible in a Penning trap using measurements of atomic transition frequencies.
