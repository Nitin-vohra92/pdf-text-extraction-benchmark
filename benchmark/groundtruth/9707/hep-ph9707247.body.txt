Gluon evolution at low x and the longitudinal structure function

Introduction

In deep inelastic scattering we can directly study the structure of the proton, particularly the parton distributions [\cite=reya] [\cite=ap] [\cite=robs]. The perturbative QCD gives the Q2 evolution and asymptotic limits of the structure function.More recently, the study of structure functions at low x [\cite=zeus1] [\cite=akm] [\cite=kms] [\cite=vio] [\cite=mrs] [\cite=grv] [\cite=ball1] [\cite=ball2] has become topical in view of the high energy collider like HERA [\cite=zeus2] [\cite=h1] where previously unexplored small x regime is being reached.In the small x regime gluons are expected to be directly measurable. This expectation has led to several approximate phenomenological schemes [\cite=coop] [\cite=cdl] [\cite=prytz1] [\cite=prytz2] [\cite=lanc]. Specifically measurement of longitudinal structure function FL has long been advocated [\cite=coop] [\cite=cdl] [\cite=orr] [\cite=neerven] [\cite=meng] [\cite=blum] as a direct probe of the gluon density at small x.There is even helpful suggestion [\cite=coop] [\cite=cdl] [\cite=meng] that precise measurement of FL should indeed be possible at HERA regime x  ≤  10- 2 and Q2  ~  10  ~  100GeV2.

The present paper aims at obtaining an approximate analytical form of gluon distribution using GLAP equations [\cite=glap] [\cite=abbot] [\cite=grib].An additive assumption on the way to this is the factorization of the x and t(t  =   ln Q2  /  Λ2) dependence of the gluon density. We test the validity of the assumption by comparing with the leading gluon density of Gluck, Reya and Vogt (LO-GRV) [\cite=grv2]. We also use our results to calculate FL(x,Q2) using its relation with gluons [\cite=coop] [\cite=cdl] within the range of validity of our assumption and compare with those of collinear [\cite=neerven] and KTfactorisation [\cite=blum] approaches.

x and t evolution of the gluons

We start our derivation,taking only the leading term of the gluonic kernel of the GLAP equations [\cite=glap] [\cite=abbot] [\cite=grib]

where [formula] and Nf  =  no. of flavours. Here we have neglected the contribution of the singlet structure function as it is expected to be small in the low x regime.In order to facilitate our analytical solution, let us assume that the x and t dependence of the structure function are factorizable [\cite=pri] [\cite=dkc]

so that

Dividing by g(x) throughout we have

[formula]

using eq.(2) and solving eq.(6) we find

Therefore,

where

[formula]

Knowing the input parametrisation of the gluons and evaluating Ig(x) numerically,we can find the gluon density for various x and t using eq.(10) .We note that in the limit x  →  0,eq.(10) has the universal limiting behaviour

to be compared with the standard double leading logarithmic expectations [\cite=rujula] [\cite=mrs2]

[formula]

which is not factorizable in x and t ,while log G(x,t) is factorizable.

The longitudinal structure function FL(x,Q2)

Measurement of FL(x,Q2) at low x have been used to extract the gluon density [\cite=coop] [\cite=cdl]

[formula]

for four active flavours. At low values of x, the gluon contribution dominates and to a fair approximation,

[formula]

Here αs is the QCD coupling strength and a is a parameter whose value is 0.417 for FL [\cite=cdl]. Using eq.(10) in eq.(15) we can thus obtain the longitudinal structure function. The behaviour of FL is known in O(α2s) [\cite=neerven] in collinear approach and was also studied in O(αs) within KT factorization scheme in [\cite=blum] .In our analysis, we compare our prediction for FL with those of [\cite=neerven] and [\cite=blum] and study their differences.

Results and conclusions

The factorization assumption eq.(2) is in general not valid in theoretical framework describing the scaling violation in QCD i.e. in LO Altarelli-Parisi equations. Even in DLA only log G(x,t) is factorizable in x and t. We have therefore attempted to see how the predictions with this assumption compare with those of gluon distribution which does not have such an assumption, like LO-GRV [\cite=grv2]. This will enable us to find the kinematical region of its approximate validity.

In Fig. 1(a-l) we show the prediction of eq.(10)(curve marked 1) with factorization ansatz eq.(2) and compare with LO-GRV [\cite=grv2](curve marked 2) for representative Q2 values 4.5, 6, 8.5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 160, 1600, 104, and 105 GeV2 and 10- 4  <  x  <  10- 1 starting with the evolution at Q2o  =  4 GeV2. These figures show the following feature for smaller x range (x  <  10- 2): at fixed x ,the difference between the two increases as Q2 is increased.As an illustration, at x  ~  10- 2 the difference increases from ~  0.1% to 20% as Q2 increases from 4.5 to 160 GeV2. For each Q2, there is a cross-over point for both the curves,where both the predictions are numerically equal.The cross-over point shifts to lower x as Q2 increases . Approximately,such cross-over occurs between 10- 2  <  x < 10- 1 for Q2  ~  4.5  -  160 GeV2 and between 10- 3  <  x  <  10- 2 for Q2  ~  160  -  105 GeV2. We can therefore find the limited range of x and Q2 where our approximate expression for gluon density differs from LO-GRV by not more than 20% as shown in Fig.2.

In Fig.3 we compare our result for FL with those obtained with collinear [\cite=neerven] and KT factorization approach [\cite=blum],at Q2  =  20 GeV2. Our result is found to be higher than those of [\cite=neerven] and [\cite=blum] . As an illustration at x  ~  10- 2 our result differs from [\cite=neerven] by 33%,67%, and 66%, corresponding to full FL(O(α2s)), O(αs) and O(α2s) respectively. On the other hand it differs by 98% with [\cite=blum] .The difference increases as x decreases. However , as the cross-over of the gluon distribution eq.(10) with LO-GRV occurs in the range x  ~  10- 1  -  10- 2 for Q2  ~  20 GeV2,the prediction may not be reliable for x  <  10- 2. It however calls for quantitative study of O(α2s) and quark contributions within the present approach.

To conclude we have shown that for a limited range of x and Q2,the gluon density eq.(10) with factorization is numerically equivalent to LO-GRV.

We have then predicted the longitudinal structure function FL within that range and compared with those obtained in other approaches [\cite=neerven] [\cite=blum]. Our result is found to be higher than those of [\cite=neerven] [\cite=blum].It will be interesting to see how our prediction for FL compares with the results of forthcoming experiments at HERA.
