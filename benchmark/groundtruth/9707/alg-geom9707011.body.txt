The Tangent Space at a Special Symplectic Instanton Bundle on 2n + 1 CARLA DIONISI

ABSTRACT :Let MI,2n + 1(k) be the moduli space of stable symplectic instanton bundles on 2n + 1 with second Chern class c2 = k (it is a closed subscheme of the moduli space MI2n + 1(k)) We prove that the dimension of its Zariski tangent space at a special (symplectic) instanton bundle is   2k(5n - 1) + 4n2 - 10n + 3  ,k  ≥  2.   It follows that special symplectic instanton bundles are smooth points for k  ≤  3

Introduction

Symplectic instanton bundles on 2n + 1 are holomorphic bundles of rank 2n (see [\cite=A] ,[\cite=MS] and [\cite=OS]) that correspond to the self-dual solutions of Yang-Mills equations on n().  They are given by some monads (see section 2 for precise definitions) and their only topological invariant is c2 = k. At present the dimension of their moduli space MI,2n + 1(k) is not known except in the cases n=1, where the dimension is 8k - 3 (see [\cite=HN]), and in few other cases corresponding to small values of k. MI,2n + 1(k) is a closed subscheme of MI2n + 1(k) and this last scheme parametrizes stable instanton bundles with structural group GL(2n). The class of special instanton bundles was introduced in [\cite=ST]. Let E∈MI2n + 1(k) be a special symplectic instanton bundle. The tangent dimension h1(End(E)) was computed in [\cite=OT] and it is equal to 4(3n - 1)k + (2n - 5)(2n - 1) . The Zariski tangent space of MI,2n + 1(k) at E is isomorphic to H1(S2E) and in this paper we prove that

[formula]

By the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula , since h0(S2E) = 0 and [formula], it follows that:

[formula]

and

Let E be a special symplectic instanton bundle.Then

[formula]

(for n = 1 it is well known that  h1(S2E) = 8k - 3 ). Now, since by the Kuranishi map H2(S2E) is the space of obstructions to the smoothness at E of MI,2n + 1(k), we obtain

[formula] the dimension of any irreducible component of MI,2n + 1(k), containing a special symplectic instanton bundle is bounded by the value 2k(5n - 1) + 4n2 - 10n + 3   ( linear in k )

[formula]   MI,2n + 1(3) is smooth at a special instanton bundle E,and the dimension of any irreducible component containing E is 4n2 + 20n - 3.

The main remark of this paper is that it is easier to compute H2(S2E) and [formula] together as SL(2)-modules (although this second cohomology space has a geometrical meaning only for orthogonal bundles) than to compute H2(S2E) alone.

Preliminaries

Throughout this paper [formula] denotes an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. U denotes a 2-dimensional [formula] vector space (U =  < s,t > ),  Sn = SnU its n-th symmetric power [formula]) , [formula] [formula]   and 2n + 1  =  (Vn).

By [\cite=OS],[\cite=AO1],the Definition  [\ref=def_1.1] is equivalent to : i)E is the cohomology bundle of a monad:

[formula]

or ii) E is the cohomology bundle of a monad:

[formula]

(where, after we have fixed a coordinate system, A and B can be identified with matrices in the space Mat(k,2n + 2k,S1))

The following lemma is well known (and easy to prove)

Existence of a special symplectic instanton bundle

There is a natural exact sequence of GL(U)-equivariant maps for any k,n  ≥  1 (Clebsch-Gordan sequence):

[formula]

where μ is the multiplication map and β is defined by [formula]

We can define (see [\cite=OT]) the morphism

[formula]

and it is induced the complex

[formula]

where A is a k-dimensional subspace of [formula] such that  ([\ref=cinque_3]) is a monad and the cohomology bundle E is a special symplectic instanton bundle. It was proved in [\cite=OT] that

[formula]

where

[formula]

and there is an isomorphism of SL(2)-representations

[formula]

How to identify H2(S2E) and [formula]

Let E be special symplectic instanton bundle ,cohomology of monad  ([\ref=cinque_3]) and N = Ker.Then

We denote [formula]   and   [formula] The result follows from the two exact sequences given by monad  ([\ref=cinque_3]) :

[formula]

[formula]

In fact, by performing the second symetric and alternating power of sequence  ([\ref=cinque_4]), we have

[formula]

where [formula] and

Identifying H2(S2N) and [formula]

i) Diagram  ([\ref=DUE]) gives the following two exact sequences:

Sequence ([\ref=cinque4]) implies:

H0(M1)  =  0   and   [formula]

Then, by using the two formulas:

[formula]

and:

[formula]

sequence  ([\ref=quattro4]) becomes:

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

[formula]

Then:

[formula]

ii) Diagram  ([\ref=TRE]) gives the following two exact sequences:

and, from sequence  ([\ref=sette4]), we get H0(M)  =  0   and   H1(M)≃S2C Then, since : [formula] and   [formula] sequence  ([\ref=sei4]) becomes :

i.e.   [formula]

[formula]

Then we obtain :

[formula]

Identifying H2(S2E)

We have     [formula] where   [formula] is explicitly given by [formula][formula] [formula] i.e.   [formula] where   [formula] is such that

[formula]

and p̃ : [formula][formula] [formula] [formula] is such that

[formula]

Now, we consider the SL(2)-equivariant morphism:

[formula]

where, up to the order of factors, the map [formula] and [formula] is defined as β. Hence, 1 is injective.

Finally, we define

[formula]

as [formula],   where ĩ : [formula] such that [formula] is an injective map. Then, also [formula] is injective.

Identifying [formula]

We have

[formula]

where   [formula]   is explicity given by [formula][formula] [formula] i.e.   [formula]   where [formula]S2([formula] [formula] [formula] is such that

[formula]

We consider the SL(2)-equivariant morphism:

[formula]

such that: [formula][formula] [formula] ([formula] hence [formula] is injective). Finally, we define

[formula]

as [formula]   where [formula][formula]  such that [formula] is an injective map. Then, also [formula] is injective

Im [formula]

Straightforward computation.

For any special symplectic instanton bundle E

[formula]

By lemma  [\ref=lemma442] and  [\ref=lemma443] we have the following diagram with exact rows and columns:

It was shown in [\cite=OT] that:

[formula]

We have proved that there are two injective maps:

[formula]

[formula]

Then, we can consider the following diagram: 0  →  S2Sk - 3[formula][formula][formula] 0 0 0 [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula]          0  →   [formula] [formula] 0 and by the Snake-Lemma there is the exact sequence : 0  →   Ker   [formula] Ker  ε  →   Ker [formula]ε  →     →  0 [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] 0 0 0 0 [formula] Thus:

[formula]

i.e.     [formula]   as we wanted.
