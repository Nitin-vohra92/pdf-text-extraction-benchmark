Introduction

In recent years diffractive photo- and leptoproduction of hadrons has become a field of growing interest. The diffractive excitation of heavy hadronic states with invariant masses [formula] has been investigated for photoproduction at FNAL [\cite=Chapin85]. Recent data from HERA explore the kinematic region 8  GeV2 < Q2  <  100  GeV2 and [formula] [\cite=H195_diff] [\cite=H196_diff] [\cite=ZEUS95_diff] [\cite=ZEUS96_diff] [\cite=ICHEP_96].

While diffractive photo- and leptoproduction of hadrons from nucleons is an interesting subject all by itself, it also plays a major role in the shadowing phenomena observed in high energy (virtual) photon-nucleus interactions. Shadowing in deep-inelastic lepton scattering is important at small values of the Bjorken scaling variable x = Q2 / 2p  ·  q, where pμ and [formula] are the nucleon and photon four-momenta, respectively, and Q2  =    -  q2. Here plenty of new data have become available from high precision experiments at FNAL (E665) [\cite=E665d] [\cite=E665] and CERN (NMC) [\cite=NMC]. Because of the fixed target nature of these experiments the average available momentum transfer is small, [formula] at x  ≪  0.1. Currently options to accelerate ions at HERA are under discussion. This would allow to investigate shadowing effects at x  ≪  0.1 also at large Q2  ≫  1  GeV2 [\cite=Nuclei_HERA].

In this paper we systematically explore nuclear shadowing in different kinematic regimes using the available experimental information on diffractive production processes from nucleons. Since the connection between diffraction and shadowing is most evident for processes involving a pair of target nucleons, we will focus on shadowing effects in deuterium. We find that in the kinematic regime of the E665 and NMC measurements shadowing is mainly due to the diffractive excitation and multiple scattering of vector mesons. This would be different at HERA, where the diffractive production of heavy mass states with M2X  ~  Q2 would play a dominant role.

Nuclear shadowing in deep-inelastic scattering can also reveal details on diffractive processes from individual nucleons. For example, the energy dependence of nuclear shadowing is directly related to the dependence of the diffractive production cross section on MX, the mass of the final hadronic state.

This paper is organized as follows: the available data on diffractive photo- and leptoproduction of hadrons are briefly summarized and discussed in Sec.2. In Sec.3 we review the relationship between shadowing and diffraction. The diffractive production cross sections from Sec.2 are then used to investigate shadowing for deuterium. Conclusions follow in Sec.4.

Diffractive production of hadrons from free nucleons

Consider the diffractive production of hadrons in the interaction of high energy real or virtual photons with free nucleons, γ*  +  N  →  X  +  N. As in diffractive hadron-hadron collisions such processes are important at small transfered momenta. The corresponding cross sections drop exponentially with [formula], where p and p' are the momenta of the initial and final nucleon. For our considerations we choose the laboratory frame where the target is at rest, [formula], and fix the z-axis to be parallel to the photon momentum: [formula]. The production of a hadronic final state X with an invariant mass MX requires a minimal momentum transfer:

[formula]

The diffractive excitation, with t required to be small, of heavy hadronic states is therefore possible only at sufficiently large photon energies ν or, equivalently, at small values of the Bjorken variable x.

In diffractive leptoproduction it is common to introduce the variable

[formula]

with W2  =  (p + q)2  ≈  2Mν  -  Q2. The notation [formula] is a reminder of pomeron phenomenology. In terms of this variable,

[formula]

Our aim here is to investigate the relation between diffractive (virtual) photoproduction of hadrons from nucleons and shadowing corrections in deep-inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering. For this purpose we need to consider the forward diffractive production cross section with t  ≈  tmin  =   - k2z,min  ≈  0. We split it into the production cross section for low mass vector mesons ρ,  ω and φ, and the cross section for hadronic final states carrying larger invariant masses M2X  >  1  GeV2:

[formula]

First we explore this cross section in the kinematic domain of nuclear shadowing as measured by the E665 and NMC experiments. In this region at x  ≪  0.1 the experimentally accessible values for the momentum transfer Q2 are small. As an example, one has for x < 0.005 an average momentum transfer [formula] [\cite=E665d] [\cite=E665] [\cite=NMC]. For a qualitative discussion, it is therefore useful first to consider diffractive (real) photoproduction processes for which more experimental data are available than in leptoproduction at finite Q2.

Photoproduction

In the case of photoproduction the vector meson contribution to the diffractive cross section in ([\ref=eq:photonDD]) can be described within the framework of generalized vector meson dominance [\cite=Baueea78] [\cite=NiPiWe96]. One finds:

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the photon spectral function as measured in e+e- annihilation and e2 / 4π  =  1 / 137. The contribution of the narrow ω- and φ-mesons to the photon spectral function is given by:

[formula]

for V = ω,φ, with the couplings gω  =  17.0, gφ  =  12.9 and masses mω  =  782  MeV, mφ  =  1019  MeV [\cite=Baueea78]. A comparison of ([\ref=eq:resonanceDD]) with recent photoproduction data taken at HERA gives for the ω-nucleon and φ-nucleon cross sections at an average center of mass energy [formula] and [formula], respectively:

[formula]

These values are in agreement with an analysis of nuclear effects in ω- and φ-production [\cite=Baueea78] in the framework of vector meson dominance. Unlike the ω- and φ-meson the ρ-meson has a large width from its strong coupling to two-pion states. Therefore neither should the ρ-meson contribution to the photon spectral function be approximated by a δ-function, nor is it useful to separate contributions from resonant and non-resonant two-pion pairs. Both are accounted for in the π+π- part of the photon spectral function which is given by the pion form factor Fπ:

[formula]

where mπ and MX = Mππ are the invariant masses of the pion and the π+π- pairs. With an effective π+π--nucleon cross section σππN  =  30  mb the main features of the mass distribution dσππγN / dMππ for Mππ < 1  GeV, as measured recently by the ZEUS collaboration [\cite=ZEUS95_rho], are reproduced. Figure 1 shows our calculated mass spectrum of π+π- pairs using eqs.([\ref=eq:resonanceDD],[\ref=eq:PiFpi]) in comparison with recent data from ZEUS [\cite=ZEUS95_rho]. A perfect fit is obtained when small corrections from a possible mass dependence of σππN are included (for details see ref.[\cite=NiPiWe96]). For the pion form factor we have used the improved vector meson dominance form from ref.[\cite=KlKaWe96] which reproduces the measured Fπ very well.

We note that the observed energy dependence of diffractive vector meson production is consistent with Regge phenomenology:

[formula]

where [formula] is the soft pomeron intercept (see e.g. [\cite=DonLan92]). This translates into an energy dependence of the effective vector meson-nucleon cross section:

[formula]

The second term in eq.([\ref=eq:photonDD]) describes the ~  1 / M2X behaviour of the diffractive production cross section for large masses MX. Guided by Regge phenomenology [\cite=Goulia83] we use the parametrization:

[formula]

With C  =  8.2  μb / GeV2(1 + ε) we obtain a fair description of the measured diffractive cross section from ref.[\cite=Chapin85] for MX > 1.5  GeV as shown in Fig.2.

Leptoproduction

Diffractive leptoproduction data have recently become available at large Q2 (8  GeV2  <  Q2  <  100  GeV2) from the H1 [\cite=H195_diff] [\cite=H196_diff] and ZEUS [\cite=ZEUS95_diff] [\cite=ZEUS96_diff] [\cite=ICHEP_96] collaborations at HERA. The corresponding diffractive production cross section is usually expressed in terms of the diffractive structure function FD(4)2. At small values x < 0.1 of the Bjorken variable we have:

[formula]

Up to now no accurate data on the t-dependence of FD(4)2 are available. Data exist only for the t-integrated structure function

[formula]

In the kinematic region of current HERA experiments one finds that FD(3)2 can be factorized as follows:

[formula]

with [formula]. Although first data on FD(3)2 were consistent with a constant n [\cite=H195_diff] [\cite=ZEUS95_diff] [\cite=ZEUS96_diff], most recent measurements from H1 indicate a weak β-dependence of n [\cite=H196_diff].

For the investigation of nuclear shadowing we need the diffractive production cross section at t  ≈  0, or equivalently [formula], in a suitably parametrized form. We are guided again by Regge phenomenology and the picture, Fig.3, which suggests the following ansatz for FD(4)2 [\cite=Regge_summ] :

[formula]

Here we have introduced the isoscalar nucleon form factor F(t), as in high energy hadron-nucleon scattering [\cite=DonLan88]. At small t we use:

[formula]

with b  ≈  4.6  GeV- 2. We expand

[formula]

For example, if α represents a soft pomeron we expect [formula], and conventional Regge behavior corresponds to α1  =  0.25  GeV- 2. The remaining function D(β,Q2) needs to be determined by comparison with the available data on FD(3)2. We find:

[formula]

Omitting a possible logarithmic Q2-dependence of the measured FD(3)2 we employ the parametrization [\cite=ZEUS95_diff]:

[formula]

in eq.([\ref=eq:F(3)]). We then use the following (different) sets of parametrizations motivated by the H1 and ZEUS data, respectively:

We use n  =  1.19 as found by the H1 collaboration [\cite=H195_diff]. Together with the conventional Regge value 0.25  GeV- 2 for α1 we take d  =  0.03 and f  =  0.6. The resulting α0  ≈  1.13 is close to the intercept [formula] expected for a soft pomeron.

The ZEUS collaboration recently found n  =  1.46 [\cite=ZEUS96_diff], which seems to be incompatible with the simple soft pomeron exchange picture. In this case we choose α1  =  0, d  =  0.007 and f  =  0.6. Here we get α0  =  (n + 1) / 2  =  1.23. Note that a "hard" pomeron intercept α0  ≈  1.5 would lead to n  ≈  2 which is too large.

In Fig.4 we compare our parametrizations to the [formula]-dependence of the measured structure function FD(3)2 as found by the H1 and ZEUS experiments. Note that a small fraction of the data includes diffractive dissociation of the nucleon target. In the present analysis we have not corrected for these events. Furthermore we observe that the t-dependence, FD(4)2  ~  eBt, of the diffractive structure function is determined by the slope

[formula]

In the kinematic range [formula] of HERA we find B  ≈  (6-9)  GeV- 2 for the H1 set (i) and B  ≈  5  GeV- 2 for the ZEUS set (ii).

Shadowing effects in deep-inelastic scattering from deuterium

The connection between diffractive (virtual) photoproduction and nuclear shadowing can be established most clearly for double scattering contributions to nuclear deep-inelastic scattering, i.e. processes in which the incoming photon beam interacts with two nucleons inside the target. To avoid complications from higher order multiple scattering we investigate shadowing effects for deuterium. This will be done in the laboratory frame. Realistic nuclear wave functions are established only in this frame.

The photon-deuteron forward scattering amplitude can be written as the sum of single and double scattering contributions:

[formula]

The A(1) amplitudes describe the incoherent scattering of the (virtual) photon from the proton or neutron, while A(2) accounts for the coherent interaction of the projectile with both nucleons. At large photon energies ν > 3  GeV, or small values of x  <  0.1 respectively, the double scattering amplitude is dominated by diffractive excitations of the photon to hadronic intermediate states. We restrict ourselves to the dominant diffractive photoproduction in the forward direction described by the amplitude Tγ*N  →  XN. Treating the deuteron target in the non-relativistic limit gives [\cite=DS]:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the deuteron wave function with the normalization [formula]. We sum over all diffractively excited hadronic states X with invariant mass MX and four-momentum [formula]. After integrating over the longitudinal momentum transfer kz the double scattering contribution to the total photon-deuteron cross section reads:

[formula]

Here [formula], and d2σDγ*N / dM2Xdt|t  ≈  0 is the forward diffractive cross section for the production of hadrons with invariant mass MX:

[formula]

In eq.([\ref=eq:ds_corr1]) we sum over all diffractive excitations which are kinematically permitted, i.e. 4m2π  ≤  M2X  ≤  W2. The longitudinal propagation length λ of the intermediate hadronic state X is the inverse of the minimal momentum transfer ([\ref=eq:long]) necessary for its diffractive excitation:

[formula]

Neglecting the real part of the diffractive production amplitudes leads to the well known result [\cite=Gribov69]:

[formula]

with the longitudinal deuteron form factor

[formula]

As soon as the longitudinal propagation length λ(M2X) of a certain hadronic intermediate state exceeds the average nucleon-nucleon distance in the nuclear target, it will contribute to double scattering and therefore to shadowing. Since λ decreases with MX, low mass diffractive excitations are important for the onset of shadowing. If the propagation length of a specific hadronic intermediate state exceeds the target diameter, λ  >  〈r2〉1 / 2  ~  4  fm for the deuteron, double scattering is not restricted since Fd  ≈  constant. Therefore in a first approximation hadronic states with an invariant mass

[formula]

contribute to double scattering. Combining eqs.([\ref=eq:photonDD],[\ref=eq:ds_corr2],[\ref=eq:MX]) yields the following approximate equation for the shadowing correction:

[formula]

where M0  ~  mφ. Here we have assumed an exponential t-dependence, ebt, for the diffractive production cross sections. The corresponding slopes for vector meson production are denoted by bV, while [formula] stands for the average slope for the production of hadronic states X with M20  <  M2X  <  M2max.

Using the parametrizations for the diffractive cross sections as derived in Sec.2, we can now discuss shadowing in the deuteron for real and virtual photon beams.

Shadowing for real photons

It is instructive to apply eq.([\ref=eq:approx]) to real photon-deuteron scattering. The relevant diffractive scattering cross sections for this case are given by eqs.([\ref=eq:resonanceDD],[\ref=eq:PPP]). We find:

[formula]

We observe two sources for the energy dependence of the shadowing correction δσγd. First, the rising diffractive photoproduction cross sections σ(γN  →  XN)  ~  W4ε with ε  ~  0.1 translate into a contribution to shadowing with a similar energy dependence. However this is not the only source for an increase of δσγd with W. With rising center of mass energy the propagation length λ also increases and allows for additional contributions to shadowing from diffractively produced states of large mass as can be seen from eq.([\ref=eq:MX]).

In Fig.5 we show the shadowing correction δσγd calculated from eq.([\ref=eq:ds_corr2]). Here a realistic deuteron form factor ([\ref=eq:deuff]) as obtained from the Paris potential [\cite=LaLoRi80] was used. For ν  >  50  GeV we find good agreement with the approximation in eq.([\ref=eq:approx_photon]). The vector meson contribution to shadowing is proportional to ν2ε  ≈  ν0.2 and dominates δσγN for ν < 300  GeV. At higher energies contributions from hadronic states of large mass also become important. In the energy range of present fixed target experiments, ν  <  400  GeV, their increase with ν is stronger than ν0.2 due to the additional contributions from large mass states.

As already mentioned, recent data on nuclear shadowing from the E665 and NMC collaborations were taken at small momentum transfers [formula] for x  ≪  0.1. The energy transfer in these experiments is typically 40  GeV  <  ν  <  380  GeV [\cite=E665d] [\cite=E665] [\cite=NMC]. Therefore the conclusion just drawn applies here too: nuclear shadowing as measured by E665 and NMC is dominated by the diffractive excitation and multiple scattering of vector mesons. This observation is in agreement with a number of model calculations (see e.g. [\cite=BadKwi92npb] [\cite=MelTho93] [\cite=PiRaWe95]). Nevertheless large mass states play their role even in the kinematic region of the E665 and NMC measurements as they are responsible for the leading twist nature of nuclear shadowing (see e.g. [\cite=PiRaWe95] [\cite=FraStr89] [\cite=NikZak91zpc] and references therein).

In Fig.6 we show the ratio of the total photon-deuteron cross section compared to twice the free photon-nucleon cross section, R  =  σγd / 2σγN. For the free photon-nucleon cross section we use the empirical photon-proton cross section from [\cite=FNAL78] with the energy dependence σγN  ~  W2ε  ≈  W0.2. Then the shadowing correction grows as δσγd / 2σγd  =  R - 1  ~  νε  ≈  ν0.1. We find that our results are well within the range of recent lepton-deuteron scattering data from the E665 collaboration [\cite=E665d] measured at [formula].

Shadowing at large Q2

When expressed in terms of the diffractive structure function the double scattering contribution to the deuteron structure function, [formula], becomes ([\ref=eq:approx]):

[formula]

where xm  ≈  1 / M〈r2〉1 / 2 and x0  ≈  Q2 / W2  ≈  x for x  ≪  0.1. An investigation of δF2d using the parametrizations for FD(4)2 as derived in Sec.2.2 yields, that shadowing is dominated at x  ≪  0.01 by the leading contribution to the diffractive structure function in the limit of small [formula]. Using eq.([\ref=eq:FD4]) we obtain at small x  ≪  0.1:

[formula]

For the different parametrizations of the diffractive structure function FD(4)2 in Sec.2.2 we find from eq.([\ref=eq:delF2d_approx]) that at x  ≪  0.01 shadowing increases with decreasing x as δF2d  ~  x- 0.25 for the parameter set (i), and δF2d  ~  x- 0.46 for (ii). This observation is confirmed by an explicit calculation of the double scattering correction using eq.([\ref=eq:ds_corr2]) together with the deuteron form factor as obtained from the Paris potential. The result for δF2d is shown in Fig. 7. For x < 0.01 it agrees well with the approximation in ([\ref=eq:delF2d_approx]). We conclude that at large [formula] and small x  <  0.01 shadowing is controlled by the behavior of the diffractive structure function at small values of [formula], or equivalently at large hadronic masses MX.

Recent data from HERA show that at corresponding values of x  ≪  0.01 and [formula] the inclusive nucleon structure function rises as F2N  ~  x-  λ with λ  =  0.25 - 0.3 [\cite=HERA_F2N]. Therefore we find that in this kinematic region R  =  F2d / 2F2N increases moderately with decreasing x for the parameter set (i) which is guided by the H1 data on the diffractive structure function. For the parameter set (ii) motivated by data from ZEUS we observe a slow decrease of the shadowing ratio with decreasing x. In Fig.8 we present the results for the structure function ratio R using the free nucleon structure function from ref.[\cite=CTEQ94] taken at Q2 = 25  GeV2.

A comparison with the results from the previous section demonstrates the qualitative difference between the energy dependence of shadowing at small and large Q2.

A similar prediction was made recently by Kopeliovich and Povh [\cite=KopPov96]. They express the virtual photon-nucleon cross section at small x through the interaction of hadronic fluctuations of the virtual photon with different transverse sizes. The contribution of a certain hadronic fluctuation is given by its weight in the photon wave function, times its interaction cross section. The probability to find large size (~  1 / ΛQCD) quark-gluon configurations in the virtual photon is suppressed by Λ2QCD / Q2, as compared to small configurations with transverse sizes b2  ~  Q- 2. However since the interaction cross sections of such hadronic fluctuations are proportional to their transverse size, both give leading contributions ~  1 / Q2 to the photon-nucleon cross section. This is different for the coherent interaction of the virtual photon with several nucleons as, in deep-inelastic scattering from nuclei at small x. For example the contribution of a hadronic fluctuation to double scattering is given by its weight in the photon wave function, multiplied by the square of its interaction cross section. Consequently large size configurations yield a leading 1 / Q2-contribution to the double scattering cross section, while contributions from small size configurations are proportional to 1 / Q4 and suppressed. Therefore multiple scattering contributions to the virtual photon-nucleus cross section at small x are dominated by the interaction of large-size hadronic fluctuations. The energy dependence of the interaction cross section of photon-induced large size quark-gluon configurations should be similar to the one observed in high energy hadron-hadron collisions, and therefore much weaker than the strong energy dependence of the nucleon structure function at small x and large Q2.

Finally we emphasize that in contrast to the Q2  ~  0 case discussed in Sec.3.1, the diffractive excitation of vector mesons is not relevant at large [formula]. This is simply a consequence of the strong decrease of vector meson production cross sections with Q2, e.g. σ(γ*N  →  ρN)  ~  Q-  β with β  ≈  4.2-5.0 [\cite=VMQ2ALL]. From eq.({[\ref=eq:approx]) we estimate the vector meson contribution to the shadowing correction δF2d to be less than 3% at large Q2.

Summary

Shadowing effects in deep-inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering are dominated by the diffractive excitation and coherent interaction of hadronic Fock states present in the wave function of the exchanged virtual photon. Therefore shadowing is closely related to diffractive leptoproduction of hadrons from individual nucleons. We have investigated this connection using the currently available experimental information for both processes. We find that in the kinematic regime of small x  ≪  0.1 and small Q2  <  1  GeV2, as in recent experiments from the NMC and E665 collaboration, shadowing is dominated by vector mesons. At large values of Q2 the situation is different. Using data on the diffractive nucleon structure function from HERA we have shown that heavy mass states play a dominant role in shadowing at small x  ≪  0.1 and large Q2  ≫  1  GeV2. Furthermore we have demonstrated that the energy dependence of shadowing is directly related to the dependence of the diffractive production cross section on the mass of the final hadronic state. In view of these results, it appears that the currently discussed option of accelerating ions at HERA could add interesting new information about diffractive processes for nuclear and nucleon targets.
