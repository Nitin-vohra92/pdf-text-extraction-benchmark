Introduction

The CP and T violation is a fundamental and important problem of the particle physics and cosmology. The CP violation has been observed only in the hadron sector, and it is very hard for us to understand where the CP violation originates from. If we observe CP violation in the lepton sector through the neutrino oscillation experiments, we will be given an invaluable key to study the origin of CP violation and to go beyond the Standard Model.

The neutrino oscillation search is a powerful experiment which can examine masses and/or mixing angles of the neutrinos. The several underground experiments, in fact, have shown lack of the solar neutrinos[\cite=Ga1] [\cite=Ga2] [\cite=Kam] [\cite=Cl] and anomaly in the atmospheric neutrinos[\cite=AtmKam] [\cite=IMB] [\cite=SOUDAN2], strongly indicating the neutrino oscillation[\cite=Fogli1] [\cite=FLM] [\cite=Yasuda]. The solar neutrino deficit implies 10- 5  ~  10- 4  eV2 as a difference of the masses squared (δm2), while the atmospheric neutrino anomaly suggests δm2 around 10- 3  ~  10- 2eV2[\cite=Fogli1] [\cite=FLM] [\cite=Yasuda].

The latter encourages us to make long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Recently such experiments are planned and will be operated in the near future[\cite=KEKKam] [\cite=Ferm]. It is now desirable to examine whether there is a chance to observe not only the neutrino oscillation but also the CP or T violation by long baseline experiments[\cite=Tanimoto] [\cite=ArafuneJoe] [\cite=Joe] [\cite=AKS] [\cite=MN] [\cite=BGG].

In this paper we review our papers[\cite=ArafuneJoe] [\cite=Joe] [\cite=AKS] to show how large violation effects of CP and T we may see in long baseline neutrino experiments with three generations of neutrinos, considering both the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly.

If we are to attribute both solar neutrino deficit and atmospheric neutrino anomaly to neutrino oscillation, it is natural to consider that one of δm2's is in the range O(10- 5  ~  10- 4  eV2) and the other is in O(10- 3  ~  10- 2  eV2). Recently, however, Acker and Pakvasa[\cite=AckPak] has argued that it is possible to explain both experiments by only one δm2 scale around O(10- 3  ~  10- 2  eV2). In the former case we cannot ignore the matter effect[\cite=Krastev] and will not see pure CP violating effect; pure CP violating effect must be separated from the matter effect. On the other hand, almost pure CP violating effect can be seen in the latter case.

In sec.[\ref=section:review] we briefly review CP and T violation in neutrino oscillation. We then consider how large T and CP violating effects can be. The case where both δm2's are O(10- 2  eV2) are considered in sec.[\ref=section:comparable]. Sec.[\ref=section:disparate] treats the "disparate" case, where the two δm2's are O(10- 2  eV2) and O(10- 4  eV2). In sec.[\ref=section:summary] we summarize our work and give discussions.

Formulation of CP and T Violation in Neutrino Oscillation

Let us briefly review CP and T violation in neutrino oscillation [\cite=FukugitaYanagida] [\cite=BilenkyPetcov] [\cite=Pakvasa] to clarify our notation.

We assume three generations of neutrinos which have mass eigenvalues mi(i = 1,2,3) and mixing matrix U relating the flavor eigenstates να(α  =  e,μ,τ) and the mass eigenstates in the vacuum ν  'i(i = 1,2,3) as

[formula]

We parameterize U[\cite=ChauKeung] [\cite=KuoPnataleone] [\cite=Toshev] as

[formula]

where cψ  =   cos ψ,sφ  =   sin φ, etc.

The evolution equation for the flavor eigenstate vector in the vacuum is

[formula]

where pi's are the momenta, E is the energy and δm2ij  =  m2i  -  m2j. Neglecting the term p1 which gives an irrelevant overall phase, we have

[formula]

Similarly the evolution equation in matter is expressed as

[formula]

where

[formula]

with a unitary mixing matrix Ũ and the effective mass squared 2i's (i = 1,2,3). (Tilde indicates quantities in the matter in the following). The matrix Ũ and the masses i's are determined by[\cite=Wolf] [\cite=MS]

[formula]

Here

[formula]

where ne is the electron density and ρ is the matter density. The solution of eq.([\ref=MatEqn]) is then

[formula]

with

[formula]

(T being the symbol for time ordering), giving the oscillation probability for να  →  νβ(α,β  =  e,μ,τ) at distance L as

[formula]

The oscillation probability for the antineutrinos P(α  →  β) is obtained by replacing a  →   - a and [formula] in eq.([\ref=alpha2beta]).

We assume in the following that the matter density is independent of space and time for simplicity. In this case we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula].

The T violation gives the difference between the transition probability of να  →  νβ and that of νβ  →  να[\cite=BWP]:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The unitarity of U gives

[formula]

with the sign +   (-  ) for α,β in cyclic (anti-cyclic) order (+   for (α,β) = (e,μ),(μ,τ) or (τ,e)). In the following we assume the cyclic order for (α, β) for simplicity.

There are bounds for J and f. J satisfies

[formula]

where the equality holds for [formula] and | sin | = 1. On the other hand, f satisfies[\cite=Cabibbo]

[formula]

where the equality holds for [formula] (mod 2π).

In the vacuum the CPT theorem gives the relation between the transition probability of anti-neutrino and that of neutrino,

[formula]

which relates CP violation to T violation:

[formula]

Cases of Comparable Mass Differences

Recently Acker and Pakvasa[\cite=AckPak] argued the possibility of explaining both solar neutrino experiments and atmospheric neutrino experiments by one mass scale, δm2  ~  O(10- 3  ~  10- 2  eV2). We first examine this "comparable mass differences" case.

We use a parameter set (δm221,δm231)  =  (3.8,1.4)  ×  10- 2eV2, [formula] with arbitrary δ, derived by Yasuda[\cite=Yasuda] through the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. We need not distinguish T violation and CP violation in this mass region since the matter effect is negligibly small. Equation ([\ref=eq:cpt]) is hence available.

Using eqs.([\ref=eq:jf]), ([\ref=eq:J]) and ([\ref=eq:cpt]), this parameter set gives the CP-violation effect

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig2] shows the oscillatory part f(y). f(y) has many peaks showing the possibility to observe the large CP-violation effect. For example, we may see very large difference between the transition probabilities, [formula] for L  =  250 km (for KEK/Super-Kamiokande experiment) and E  ~   4.5 GeV corresponding to y  ~  1.4. Hence it will be possible to detect CP-violation effect if we have large sin δ.

In general atmospheric neutrino anomaly indicates large mixing angles. We may see a large CP-violation effect when we have comparable mass differences. In this respect we note that the long baseline experiments are urgently desirable.

Cases of Disparate Mass Differences

Both solar neutrino deficit and atmospheric neutrino anomaly are naturally explained by introducing two mass scales. Solar neutrino experiments suggest a mass difference of O(10- 5  ~  10- 4  eV2), while atmospheric neutrino measurements imply O(10- 3  ~  10- 2  eV2). Here we consider this "disparate mass difference" case. We see in this case that matter effect given by eq.([\ref=aDef]) is the same order of magnitude as the smaller mass scale. Hence we cannot ignore matter effect.

Transition Probabilities in Presence of Matter

Let us derive simple expressions of oscillation probabilities assuming a,δm221  ≪  δm231. Decomposing H  =  H0  +  H1 with

[formula]

and

[formula]

we treat H1 as a perturbation and calculate eq.([\ref=simpleS]) up to the first order in a and δm221. Defining Ω(x) and H1(x) as

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

which give the solution

[formula]

We note the approximation ([\ref=OmegaApprox]) requires

[formula]

The equations ([\ref=Omegadef]) and ([\ref=OmegaApprox]) give

[formula]

We then obtain the oscillation probabilities P(νμ  →  νe), P(νμ  →  νμ) and P(νμ  →  ντ) in the lowest order approximation as

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

(Detailed derivation is presented in the [\ref=appendix:derivation]). The transition probabilities for other processes can be written down explicitly, though we do not present them here. We chose νμ as initial state allowing for experimental availability.

As is shown in the above transition probabilities, there is matter effect (proportional to "a") and we need to distinguish pure CP-violation effect from the fake CP violation due to matter.

T Violation

Since T violation is free from the matter effect for the lowest order, we first consider how large the T-violation effect can be. As illustrated in [\ref=appendix:derivation] (the last term of eq.([\ref=alpha2betaapp])), T-violation effects are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

which coincide with eq.([\ref=eq:jf]). We see the oscillatory part f defined in eq.([\ref=eq:jf]) is given by (see eq.([\ref=eq:fv]))

[formula]

for our approximation. Here [formula], since Δ31  ~  1 and Δ21  ≪  1 (recall eq.([\ref=eq:Delta-numerical])).

We show in Fig.[\ref=fig1] the graph of f(Δ31,δm21  /  δm31  =  0.03). The approximation eq.([\ref=eq:fapp]) works very well up to |εΔ31|  ~  1. In the following we will use eq.([\ref=eq:fapp]) instead of eq.([\ref=eq:fdef]). We see many peaks of f(Δ31,ε) in Fig.[\ref=fig1]. In practice, however, we do not see such sharp peaks but observe the value averaged around there, for Δ31 has a spread due to the energy spread of neutrino beam (|δΔ31  /  Δ31|  =  |δE / E|). In the following we will assume |δΔ31  /  Δ31|  =  |δE  /  E|  =  20% [\cite=Nishikawa] as a typical value.

Table [\ref=table1] gives values of f(Δ31,ε) / ε at the first several peaks and the averaged values around there.

We see the T-violation effect,

[formula]

for

[formula]

at peaks for neutrino beams with 20% of energy spread. Note that the averaged peak values decrease with the spread of neutrino energy.

It depends on δm231,L and E which peak we can reach. The first peak Δ31  =  3.67 is reached, for example, by δm231  =  10- 2 eV2, L = 250 km (for KEK/Super-Kamiokande long baseline experiments) and neutrino energy E  =  1.73 GeV. In this case we see the T-violation effect at best of |25.9Jε|  ≤  2.50ε since we have a bound on J as eq.([\ref=eq:Jmax]).

"CP Violation"

In practice only νμ and μ are available by accelerator. It is therefore of practical importance to consider pure CP-violation effect through the observation of "CP violation", i.e. difference between P(να  →  νβ) and P(α  →  β).

Recalling that P(α  →  β) is obtained from P(να  →  νβ) by the replacements a  →   - a and δ  →    -  δ, we have

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here we make some comments.

P(να  →  νβ)'s and ΔP(να  →  νβ)'s depend on L and E as functions of L / E apart from the matter effect factor [formula].

At least four experimental data are necessary to determine the function ΔP(νμ  →  νe), since it has four unknown factors: δm231,δm221,c2φs2φs2ψ(1 - 2s2φ) and sδc2φsφcψsψcωsω. In order to determine all the mixing angles and the CP violating phase, we need to observe P(νμ  →  νμ) and P(μ  →  μ) in addition.

ΔP(νμ  →  νμ) is independent of δ and consists only of matter effect term.

"CP violation", the difference between P(να  →  νβ) and P(α  →  β), consists of two effects: pure CP-violation effect and matter effect. We now investigate how we can divide ΔP(νμ  →  νe) into a pure CP-violation part and a matter effect part. The terms ΔP1(νμ  →  νe) and ΔP2(νμ  →  νe), which are proportional to "a", are due to effect of the matter along the path. The term ΔP3(νμ  →  νe), which is proportional to sδ, represents the pure CP violation and indeed coincides with the T violation, eq.([\ref=T-violation:mu2e]) (We simply call ΔPi(νμ  →  νe) as ΔPi hereafter). In the following we introduce two methods to separate the pure CP violating effect ΔP3 from the matter effect ΔP1  +  ΔP2.

Observation of Envelope Patterns

One method is to observe the pattern of the envelope of ΔP, and to separate ΔP3 from it. Considering the energy dependence of [formula], we see that ΔP1 / L, ΔP2 / L and ΔP3 depend on a variable L / E alone. The dependences of them on the variable L / E, however, are different from each other as seen in Fig. [\ref=OscBehave]. Each of them oscillates with common zeros at [formula] and has its characteristic envelope. The envelope of ΔP1 / L decreases monotonously. That of ΔP2 / L is flat. That of ΔP3 increases linearly. It is thus possible to separate these three functions and determine CP violating effect ΔP3 by measuring the probability ΔP over wide energy range in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. This method has a merit that we can determine the pure CP violating effect with a single detector.

In Fig.[\ref=OscProb1] we give the probabilities P(νμ  →  νe) and P(μ  →  e) for a set of typical parameters which are consistent with the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments[\cite=FLM]: [formula] and sω  =  1 / 2. We see the effect of pure CP violation in Fig.[\ref=OscProb1](a), since we find that the curve ΔP has the envelope characteristic of ΔP3.

We comment that the envelope behavior of ΔP can be understood rather simply: Since ΔP3 represents the pure CP violation, which is same as the T-violation effect in the lowest order of the matter effect,

[formula]

(See the discussion above the eq.([\ref=eq:fapp])). This shows ΔP3 has a linearly increasing envelope [formula]. On the other hand, the envelopes of ΔP1 and ΔP2 do not increase with L / E for fixed L, and it makes ΔP3 dominant in ΔP for large L / E.

Such characters of envelope behaviors enables us to determine whether CP-violation effect is present or not even in case neutrino beam has energy spread; for neutrino with widely spread energy spectrum, we observe the average of "CP-violation" effect which is not zero if there is pure CP-violation effect (see Fig.[\ref=OscProb1]).

Comparison of Experiments with Different L's

The other method is to separate the pure CP violating effect by comparison of experiments with two different L's. Suppose that two experiments, one with L  =  L1 and the other L  =  L2, are available. We observe two probabilities P(νμ  →  νe;E1,L1) and P(νμ  →  νe;E2,L2) with L1  /  E1  =  L2  /  E2. Recalling that P(νμ  →  νe;L) is a function of L / E apart from the matter effect factor [formula], we see that the difference

[formula]

is due only to terms proportional to "a". We obtain ΔP3 by subtracting these terms (ΔP1  +  ΔP2) from ΔP(νμ  →  νe) as

[formula]

This method has a merit that it does not need to observe the envelope nor many oscillation bumps in the low energy range.

In Fig.[\ref=MinosKek] we compare P(νμ  →  νe) for L = 250km (KEK/Super-Kamiokande experiment) with that for L = 730km (Minos experiment) in a case with the same neutrino masses and mixing angles as those in Fig.[\ref=OscProb1](a). We see their difference, consisting only of the matter effect, has the same shape as the solid line in Fig. [\ref=OscProb1](b) up to a overall constant. We also show the pure CP violating effect obtained by the two probabilities with eq.([\ref=SubMatterEff1]). This curve has a linearly increasing envelope as seen in Fig. [\ref=OscBehave](c).

In this section we have shown that it is possible to determine the CP-violation effect in case δm2's have small values of O(10- 4eV2) and O(10- 2  eV2), respecting solar neutrino deficit and atmospheric neutrino anomaly. Even in this case we may see about 5% or more CP-violation effect in the near future.

Summary and Discussions

We have examined the CP and T violation in the neutrino oscillation and analyzed how large the violation can be, taking into account the solar neutrino deficit and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly.

In case of the comparable mass differences with δm221,δm231 and δm232 in the range 10- 3 to 10- 2eV2, which is consistent with the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino anomalies (and maybe with the solar neutrino deficit), it is found that there is a possibility that the CP violation effect is large enough to be observed by 100 ~   1000 km baseline experiments if the CP violating parameter sinδ is sufficiently large.

In case that δm221 is much smaller than δm231, which is favored if we attribute both the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies to the neutrino oscillation, the matter effect by the earth gives the effective mass equal or greater than the smaller mass difference δm221 and we cannot ignore the presence of matter.

We have given very simple formulae for the transition probabilities of neutrinos in long baseline experiments for this case. They have taken into account not only the CP-violation effect but also the matter effect, and are applicable to such interesting parameter regions that can explain both the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino deficit by the neutrino oscillation.

With these simple expressions we have shown that measurement of the T violation gives the pure CP violating effect.

We have also shown with the aid of these formulae two methods to distinguish pure CP violation from matter effect. The dependence of pure CP-violation effect on the energy E and the distance L is different from that of matter effect: The former depends on L / E alone and has a form f(L / E), while the latter has a form [formula]. One method to distinguish is to observe closely the energy dependence of the difference P(νμ  →  νe;L)  -  P(μ  →  e;L) including the envelope of oscillation bumps. The other is to compare results from two different distances L1 and L2 with L1 / E1  =  L2 / E2 and then to subtract the matter effect by eq.([\ref=SubMatterEff1]) or eq.([\ref=SubMatterEff2]).

Each method has both its merits and demerits. The first one has a merit that we need experiments with only a single detector. A merit of the second is that we do not need wide range of energy (many bumps) to survey the neutrino oscillation.

It is desirable to make long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments with high intensity neutrino flux, and to study CP violation in the lepton sector experimentally. Even if the mass differences are very disparate we may see about 5% or more CP violation as is seen from Fig.[\ref=OscProb1] and Fig.[\ref=MinosKek].

Derivation of the Oscillation Probabilities

Here we present the derivation of eq.([\ref=mu2e]) ~   eq.([\ref=mu2tau]) with use of eq.([\ref=S0+S1]), and show how well this approximation works. Let us set S(x)  =  S0(x)  +  S1(x), defining

[formula]

We see

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Using

[formula]

and

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

with

[formula]

We then obtain the oscillation probability in the lowest order approximation as

[formula]

Substituting eq.([\ref=UPar2]) in eq.([\ref=alpha2betaapp]) we finally obtain eq.([\ref=mu2e]) ~   eq.([\ref=mu2tau]). Note that all the terms except the last one in eq.([\ref=alpha2betaapp]) is invariant under the exchange of α and β; the last term changes its sign by this exchange. It is thus obvious that the last term gives T-violation effect.

Figure [\ref=Exact&ApproxCompare] shows how well this approximation works for KEK/Super-Kamiokande experiments and also for Minos experiments with the same masses, mixing angles and CP violating phase as in Fig.[\ref=OscProb1](a). Our approximation requires (see eq.([\ref=AppCond]))

[formula]

and

[formula]

which is marginally satisfied for L  =  730km. We see that even in this case eq.([\ref=alpha2betaapp]) gives good approximation.

We stated that we can use an averaged value [formula] in place of a in case matter density spatially varies. We present in Fig.[\ref=nonuniformMatter] the goodness of constant matter density approximation for KEK/Super-Kamiokande experiments.
