Combinatorial tools for Regge Calculus

Introduction

Although Regge Calculus [\cite=regge], that is a "discretized formulation" of General Relativity, is now more than 35 years old, there is an incredible lack of classical solutions obtained with it, except for highly symmetric ones (Schwarzschild or cosmological model). This fact is quite unsatisfactory because one of the motivations of Regge Calculus was the need for a way to obtain solutions of General Relativity, even approximate ones, without any particular symmetry. The origin of this situation is the lack of a general evolution scheme powerful enough to deal with generic (not symmetric) spacetime; in this work we review recent results that seem to point toward a solution of the problem [\cite=barr] [\cite=tuck] [\cite=sorkin] [\cite=tesi] [\cite=tutti]. Since this is a short communication, we will omit all demonstrations and will skip a lot of technicalities; we hope to present an expanded version of this work in a future paper.

Mathematical tools

Let [formula] be a "Regge spacetime", i.e. a regular simplicial complex of dimension n with a Lorentzian "metric", i.e. a particular assignment of a length to every edge of [formula] (see [\cite=sorkin] [\cite=tesi] for details); for the sake of simplicity we consider only compact spacetime. A spatial section [formula] is a closed regular (n - 1)-dimensional simplicial subcomplex of [formula] with all the edges of "spatial" type; another spatial section [formula] is said to be evolved from [formula] if every vertex of [formula] is contained in the envelope of future cones of the points of [formula]. We say that such evolution is performed by a move if the subcomplex [formula] composed of the (n - 1)-simplices that belongs to [formula] but not to [formula] has the topology of an (n - 1)-dimensional ball. If one defines analogously [formula], it is simple to see that every move is characterized by a compact n-dimensional simplicial complex [formula] whose boundary is [formula]; one can think of the move as the "gluing" of [formula] on [formula].

A p-simplex in [formula] (with p  <  n) is said to be new if it does not belong to [formula] and it is said to be internal if it does not belong to [formula]. It is useful, as we will see later, to introduce the two quantities [formula] and [formula] that are, respectively, the number of new p-simplices and of internal p-simplices introduced by the move [formula].

Sorkin [\cite=sorkin] (without using this formalism) has introduced a very useful move, recently rediscovered and generalized by Tuckey [\cite=tuck]: if [formula] is a vertex of [formula] one introduces a new vertex [formula] in the future cone of [formula] and than connects it with all the vertices of [formula] that are connected to [formula] itself. It is easy to see that this is actually a move and that [formula], where we have called [formula] the Sorkin move. We will see that such a move plays a fundamental role in the evolution problem for Regge Calculus.

If [formula] is just an n-simplex then the move is said to be elementary or simple; obviously there are exactly n different simple moves that corresponds to the possible ways to glue an n-simplex to an (n - 1)-dimensional section. The simple moves can be labeled with the numbers of (n - 1)-faces of [formula] that are in [formula]; we use the term f-move to indicate a simple move with f such faces. Indicating with f an f-move, it is possible to prove the following formulas :

[formula]

[formula]

It is a well established theorem [\cite=barr] that every move [formula] can be decomposed into a sequence of elementary ones; we call [formula] the number of f-moves contained in the decomposition of [formula]. Using the preceding formulas we can obtain very easily the decomposition of a Sorkin move into simple ones; since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

In the same way one obtains

[formula]

The Regge evolutive problem

The general case

The evolution problem in classical Regge Calculus can be formulated in the following way [\cite=barr] [\cite=tuck] [\cite=sorkin] [\cite=tesi] [\cite=tutti].

The starting point is an n-dimensional simplicial complex [formula] that has to provide the initial conditions for the problem; all the lengths of the edges of [formula] are known and fixed. The boundary of [formula] must be composed by at least one spatial section [formula] (and maybe by another spatial section in the past of [formula]); the problem is to give an algorithm to evolve [formula] in time using Regge's equations. First of all perform a Sorkin move on a vertex [formula], obtaining in this way a new section [formula] with the same connectivity as [formula]. Such a move introduces (see preceding section) the same number [formula] (that is the number of vertices in [formula] connected to [formula] plus one) of new edges and of internal edges; it is easy to see that new edges introduce new unknowns (their lengths) whereas internal edges introduce new Regge equations (we remind the reader that Regge equations are associated to the edges of the lattice).

Not all of these equations are independent because of a sort of diffeomorphisms invariance for Regge Calculus [\cite=tesi] [\cite=galassi]. There are actually n degrees of freedom in the choice of n lengths of the new edges; the remaining x - n lengths are fixed by solving an [formula] dimensional system of equations associated to [formula] internal edges (we call it the Sorkin system).

After the evolution of [formula] one can iterate the procedure and evolve, in the same way, another vertex of [formula] until all the vertices of [formula] have been evolved and one has obtained a new spatial section [formula].

This evolving procedure is quite flexible and is useful in a general, not symmetric case .

Could the decomposition of a Sorkin move into elementary ones, discussed in the preceding section, further simplify such a scheme? The answer is yes and we will show briefly this fact in the next sections.

(2 + 1)-gravity

If n = 3 one obtains immediately the decomposition of a Sorkin move into elementary ones:

[formula]

[formula]

The first move is a 1-move that introduces 3 new edges without any equation, so that there is freedom in the choice of the 3 new lengths (lapse and shift freedom of choice); than one performs (xa - 3) 2-moves, each one introducing one unknown and one equation (since N21  =  I21  =  1). Finally one performs a 3-move that introduces 3 equations but no unknowns and so they have to be automatically satisfied. This shows that the decomposition into elementary moves permits the complete decoupling of the system of equations related to a Sorkin move; this fact obviously introduce a big simplification in numerical uses of Regge Calculus.

Some issues for the (3 + 1)-dimensional case

In 4 dimensions the decomposition of [formula] into elementary moves is a little more complicated;

[formula]

[formula]

The first and last moves are as before, but now the 2-moves introduce each one unknown but no equation (N21 = 1, I21  =  0), while the 3-moves act in the opposite way (N31 = 0, I31  =  1). In general it is not possible to decouple the Sorkin system of equations; but it may happen, for particular lattices, that the Sorkin move is decomposable in a way such that after a 2-move there is always a 3-move. In this particular case one obtain again a complete decoupling of the Sorkin system of equations, with obvious numerical advantages. One could imagine also an intermediate situation with only a partial decoupling of such a system.

We have actually built some explicit examples of lattices with complete and partial decoupling, but there is not enough space here to discuss them; we are still investigating the subject.

Conclusion

It is not possible to discuss here, from a physical point of view, the results obtained, but it is clear that simplifications in the evolution problem of the kind we have presented in this short note could be very useful in an extensive use of Regge Calculus as a numerical tool of investigation; we hope that this and other discussions on the subject (as the ones cited in this work) can open a new "golden age" for classical Regge Calculus.
