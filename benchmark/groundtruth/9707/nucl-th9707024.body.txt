Abstract

The Toda criterion of the Gaussian curvature is applied to calculate analytically the transition energy from regular to chaotic motion in a schematic model describing the interaction between collective dipole and quadrupole modes in atomic nuclei.

In recent years great interest has been shown in nonlinear effects in nuclear1) and particle physics2). These phenomena may be considered the precursors of order-chaos transition. In these systems this transition has usually been studied numerically with Lyapunov exponents and Poincarè sections3). Less attention has been paid to analytical criteria.

In this paper we study the hamiltonian:

[formula]

introduced by Bohr and Mottelson4) in order to describe the coupling between the giant-dipole resonance (GDR) and the quadrupole excitation, later used by the authors of reference5). The vibration in the q1 direction is associated with the GDR, while the q2 motion plays the role of quadrupole deformation of the nuclear surface. Here the parameters of inertia Bi and of stiffness Ci (i = 1,2) are real constants. The perturbing potential k1q21q2 induces a splitting of the dipole frequency caused by the static quadrupole deformation. Bohr and Mottelson4) give the estimation [formula] for the coupling parameter, in order to reproduce the experimental data of fotoabsorption in deformed nuclei4).

The aim of this work is to apply the Toda criterion of the Gaussian Curvature6) to the Hamiltonian (1) in order to calculate the energy of the onset of chaotic motion, henceforth Ec.

The Toda criterion is based on a local estimation of the rate of separation of neighboring trajectories in the classical phase space of the model6),7). To obtain the time evolution of a dynamical system with the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where [formula], k = 1,2, the following equations have to be solved:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The linearized equation of motion for the deviations are

[formula]

where M- 1ij  =  δijB- 1i, and

[formula]

where [formula] is the solution of (3). The stability of the dynamical system is then determined by the eigenvalues of the 4  ×  4 stability matrix

[formula]

If at least one of the eigenvalues λi of the stability matrix Γ is real, then the separation of the trajectories grows exponentially and the motion is unstable. Imaginary eigenvalues correspond to stable motion.

To diagonalize the matrix Γ, we must first solve the equation of motion (3). The problem can be significantly simplified by assuming that the time dependence can be eliminated by replacement of the time-dependent point [formula] of configuration space by a time-independent coordinate [formula], i.e. [formula]. The eigenvalues then are

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Now, if b > 0 then with c  ≥  0 the eigenvalues are purely imaginary and the motion is stable, while with c < 0 the pair of eigenvalues becomes real and this leads to exponential separation of neighboring trajectories, i.e. chaotic motion. The parameter c has the same sign as the Gaussian curvature KG of the potential-energy surface:

[formula]

For our nuclear model the potential energy is given by

[formula]

and the Γ matrix reads

[formula]

The potential has one minimum for q1 = q2 = 0 with V = 0, and two saddle points for [formula], [formula]. These are the points for which the curvature criterion is exact (they are the fixed points of the Hamilton equations). The origin is a stable elliptic point and the two saddle points are unstable hyperbolic points.

The dissociation energy of this model is [formula] and it occurs at the saddle points of the potential energy surface. Classically, a particle located within the potential well with energy 0 < E < ED is always bound.

The Gaussian curvature vanishes at the points that satisfy the equation

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula]. At low energies, the motion near the minimum of the potential energy, where the curvature is positive, is periodic or quasi-periodic and is separated from the region of instability by a line of zero curvature; if the energy increases, the system will be, for some initial conditions, in a region of negative curvature where the motion is chaotic. In accordance with this scenario, the energy of order→  chaos transition Ec is equal to the minimum value of the line of zero Gaussian curvature KG of the potential-energy surface of the system6),7). The energy of the zero-curvature line is determined by the expression

[formula]

It is easy to show that the minimal energy on the zero-curvature line is given by

[formula]

This is the energy of the onset of chaos of the model and we see that Ec = ED / 2.

With the estimation [formula] we have

[formula]

By using the charged liquid drop approximation4) for the stiffness coefficient C2, we obtain for Ec the following relation

[formula]

where bs≃17 MeV, r0≃1.2 fm, A and Z are the atomic and proton numbers respectively (see Figure 1). With the liquid-drop approximation4), the Coulomb repulsion counteracts the effect of the surface tension and leads to negative values of C2 for Z2 / A  >  (10 / 3)(bsr0 / e2)≃49.

We can use the experimental quadrupole frequency ω2 and B(E2) values to determine4) the restoring force parameter C2. In this case

[formula]

The experimental values of C2 exhibit variations greater by a factor 10 above and below the liquid-drop estimation. This effect can be understood in terms of the approach to instability as particles are added to the closed shells and so Ec is in the range ≃0.5-5 MeV depending on the nucleus.

The curvature criterion is able to characterize the local behaviour of the system (for example the local instability) and may give only a signature of the global properties (e.g. the global instability). As is well known, a very useful tool for the study of global properties is provided by the Poincarè sections9). With this aim the classical trajectories have been calculated by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. In order to avoid numerical errors connected to the use of finite temporal intervals, a first-order interpolation has been used10).

The Hamilton equations of the systems are:

[formula]

[formula]

Figure 2 shows the Poincarè sections for different values of the energy. Below the critical energy Ec the system is regular but above Ec, the Poincarè sections clearly show an order-chaos transition as the energy increases.

In conclusion, the Poincarè sections show that in our schematic model, which describes the interaction between collective dipole and quadrupole modes in atomic nuclei, the Toda criterion of the Gaussian curvature gives a quite good estimate of the energy Ec of the onset of chaos. This critical energy Ec depends on the stiffness coefficient of the quadrupole vibration, which can be estimated analytically within the liquid-drop approximation or can be experimentally determined by using the quadrupole frequency ω2 and the B(E2) transition probabilities.
