Hadron yields, the chemical freeze-out and the QCD phase diagram

Chemical freeze-out of light-quark hadrons

Chemical freeze-out in nucleus-nucleus collisions is addressed in the statistical hadronization (thermal) model, based on the statistical operator for the hadron resonance gas. It describes a snapshot of the collision dynamics, namely assuming a rapid chemical freeze-out. The model is simple, but very powerful considering its small set of parameters (temperature T, baryochemical potential μB and volume V). Importantly, the model is a unique phenomenological approach linking the production of hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions to the QCD phase diagram [\cite=BraunMunzinger:2008tz] (see [\cite=Cabibbo:1975ig] [\cite=Hagedorn:1984hz] for early ideas).

All known hadrons, stable and decaying, are employed in the calculations. Even as the knowledge of the hadron spectrum is constantly improving, missing states could in principle still have an effect on T, as shown in lattice QCD studies [\cite=Bazavov:2014xya]. As currently the prefered T values are around 160 MeV (see below) the relevance of higher-lying resonances is diminished. In the commonly-used grand canonical approach, chemical potentials μ ensure conservation on average of additive quantum numbers (baryon number, isospin, strangeness, charmness), fixed by "initial conditions".

The model, in its "standard" implementation (meaning the minimal set of parameters listed above), was sucessfully used to describe hadron production in heavy-ion collisions over a wide range of collision energies (see e.g. [\cite=Andronic:2005yp] [\cite=Becattini:2005xt]). Several versions with extended set of parameters have been proposed [\cite=Letessier:2005qe] [\cite=Petran:2013qla]. In particular, a strangeness suppression factor γs is used as a fit parameter to test the possible departure from equilibrium of hadrons containing strange quark(s) (see, e.g. [\cite=Becattini:2005xt]). The question of flavor-dependent freeze-out is also addressed [\cite=Bazavov:2013dta] [\cite=Bellwied:2013cta] [\cite=Chatterjee:2013yga]. Beyond the sudden freeze-out concept, a hadronic phase with "chemical activity" with the UrQMD transport model [\cite=Becattini:2016xct] was proposed. Some times, possible repulsive interactions among hadrons are modeled in a hard-sphere excluded-volume approach. In the simplest implementation, identical (and moderate) values for the radii are used (Rmeson = Rbaryon = 0.3 fm), leaving T and μB unaffected in comparison with results for point-like hadrons [\cite=Andronic:2005yp]. Employing species-dependent hard-sphere interactions [\cite=Vovchenko:2015cbk] leads to an extended parameter set, which, however, cannot be constrained by current knowledge of hadron-hadron interactions. As the results below demonstrate, the data do not require any of these extensions.

For small systems and/or low energies, a canonical treatment is needed [\cite=Cleymans:1998yb], usually implemented only for strangeness. Recent such studies in p-Nb and Ar-KCl collisions [\cite=Agakishiev:2015bwu] and in pp collisions [\cite=Vovchenko:2015idt] [\cite=Das:2016muc] [\cite=Cleymans:2016qnc] lead to values of T comparable to (or even larger than) those in (central) Au-Au or Pb-Pb collisions. The studies performed by ALICE in p-Pb [\cite=Adam:2015vsf] and pp [\cite=Adam:2016emw] collisions revealed that in high-multiplicity events hadron production in these small systems resembles that in Pb-Pb collisions.

We show below, employing our "standard" model [\cite=Andronic:2008gu] [\cite=Stachel:2013zma], the current description of the LHC data in central (0-10%) Pb-Pb collisions at [formula] TeV. This model is based on the statistical operator for the hadron resonance gas which was shown earlier [\cite=Andronic:2012ut] to lead to an equation of state in good agreement with lattice QCD calculations. The best fit values and their uncertainties are: T = 156.5  ±  1.5 MeV, μB = 0.7  ±  3.8 MeV, VΔy = 1 = 5280  ±  410 fm3, achieved for χ2min = 29.1 per 18 d.o.f., indicating a very good description of data, which extends over 9 orders of magnitude in hadron yields, see Fig. [\ref=f:fit] and Fig. [\ref=f:chi]. Included in the calculations are the contribution in the yields of π, K±, and K0 from the decays of charmed hadrons, amounting to a relative contribution for the best fit of 0.7%, 2.9%, and 3.1%, respectively. While we used Rmeson = Rbaryon = 0.3 fm, point-like hadrons lead to a fit with same T and μB values, but a volume smaller by about 25%.

In Fig. [\ref=f:ratios] an illustration is shown of the success of the thermal model in reproducing over a broad energy range the production of (anti)protons and kaons relative to pions.

The value of the (pseudo-)critical temperature, Tc, at vanishing baryochemical potential (μB) is currently calculated in lattice QCD [\cite=Borsanyi:2010bp] [\cite=Bazavov:2014noa] to be 155±  9 MeV. The phenomenological QCD phase diagram is shown in Fig. [\ref=f:tmu]. Remarkably, at low μB chemical freeze-out coincides with Tc, indicating hadron formation from deconfined matter. Each point corresponds to a fit of hadron yields in central Au-Au or Pb-Pb collisions at a given collision energy. The agreement between the results from several independent analyses [\cite=Andronic:2008gu] [\cite=Manninen:2008mg] [\cite=Abelev:2009bw] [\cite=Aggarwal:2010pj] is very good. Note that in some cases [\cite=Manninen:2008mg] [\cite=Abelev:2009bw] [\cite=Aggarwal:2010pj] an additional fit parameter, the strangeness suppression factor γs, is used to test possible departure from equilibrium of hadrons containing strange quark(s). Values of γs (slightly) below unity are found. The non-equilibrium model [\cite=Letessier:2005qe] [\cite=Petran:2013qla] leads to rather different results (smaller T values for small μB), while the model with an extended hadronic phase [\cite=Becattini:2016xct] implies larger T values (neither of these 2 models are shown here).

Charmonium

The statistical hadronization model outlined above can be applied as well to production of hadrons with heavy quarks (HQ), charm and bottom [\cite=BraunMunzinger:2000px] [\cite=Andronic:2006ky]. Given that the HQ themselves are produced predominantly in primary hard collisions (for charm, tc  ~  1 / 2mc≃ 0.1 fm/c), the model describes, in a more explicit way than for lighter quarks, the hadronization stage. One additional input parameter, the HQ production cross section, is employed, as well as the assumption the HQ survive and thermalize in QGP (thermal, but not chemical equilibrium). We discuss here the current status of the model description of the J/ψ production at the LHC, quantified via the nuclear modification factor RJ / ψAA.

Within the statistical hadronization approach a new charmonium production regime was predicted [\cite=BraunMunzinger:2000px] [\cite=Andronic:2006ky] for LHC energies. Consequently, the measurement was expected to be decisive in clarifying the suppression via the Debye screening mechanism [\cite=Matsui:1986dk] and answering if (re)generation scenarios are viable production mechanisms. The data [\cite=Abelev:2013ila] [\cite=Adam:2016rdg] showed that statistical generation at the chemical freeze-out is likely the mechanism of J/ψ production, as demonstrated by the good agreement of model predictions and data, Fig. [\ref=f:jpsi]. The uncertainty in the model predictions is due to the c production cross section, obtained by extrapolating the LHCb measurement [\cite=Aaij:2013mga] in pp collisions at [formula]=7 TeV using FONLL pQCD calculations [\cite=Cacciari:2012ny] and a shadowing factor from EPS09 calculations [\cite=Vogt:2015uba] (0.71±  0.10 for 2.5  <  y  <  4.0). Transport models [\cite=Zhao:2011cv] [\cite=Zhou:2014kka] describe the data as well, assuming production during the whole lifetime of QGP. However, the tantalizing possibility of having the J/ψ meson as a probe of the QCD phase boundary is very appealing.
