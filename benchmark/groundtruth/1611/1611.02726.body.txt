Single-photon detectors combining near unity efficiency, ultra-high detection-rates, and ultra-high time resolution

Single-photon detectors play a pivotal role in quantum optics. They have demonstrated advantages in quantum cryptography[\cite=Gisin:2002], experiments with quantum dots and color centers [\cite=Felle:2015] [\cite=Christle:2015], spin-photon entanglement [\cite=DeGreve:2012], laser ranging[\cite=McCarthy:2013], biological imaging[\cite=Peer:2007], and CMOS testing[\cite=Zhang:2003], among others. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) because of their sensitivity in the near infrared, low dark count rate and good timing properties have been proven as the most promising technology, allowing in principle to combine high performances in all key parameters: very high efficiencies, high time resolution, low dark counts and high detection rates.

Efficient SNSPDs, achieving 93% system detection efficiency, based on a-WSi have been demonstrated [\cite=Marsili:2013]. Low dark-count and low timing jitter SNSPDs have also been shown separately based on NbN detectors [\cite=Schuck:2013] [\cite=Shcheslavskiy:2016]. Finally, in a recent work [\cite=Zhang:2016] high efficiency NbN detectors in conjunction with low jitter and low dark count rate has been shown. However, no high count-rate performance for this detector is reported. Furthermore, this detector requires active positioning using piezoelectric stages.

In all mentioned cases, the detectors, for their best performance, operate at much lower temperatures than the base temperature of typical Gifford-McMahon close cycle systems. This limits the choice of cryostat and increases the complexity. Here we report, a self-aligned fiber coupled SNSPD with high efficiency, low dark count rate, low timing jitter and high count-rate. Our detectors are mounted in a conventional Gifford-McMahon cryostat with base temperature of 2.5 K.

Our detectors are fabricated on NbTiN films that are deposited using DC magnetron sputtering with a thickness of 8.4 nm. After sputtering, the contacts were first formed using optical lithography and metal evaporation. The nanowires are fabricated on gold mirrors separated by a layer of SiO2 serving as a cavity. The cavity is designed to maximize the detector absorption at the desired range of wavelengths [\cite=Tanner:2010]. We optimized the nanowire width, 50 nm, the filling factor, 0.42, and the diameter of the detector to be 14 μm. The nanowires were patterned using hydrogen silsesquioxane ebeam resist and were transferred to the NbTiN layer by dry etching in a SF6 and O2 chemistry. Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1]a presents an SEM image of a fabricated device. The top inset in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1]a shows a magnified photo of the detector and the bottom inset provides an optical microscope picture, showing the device fabricated on gold mirror. For fiber coupling of the detectors, using a Bosch process similar to [\cite=Dorenbos:2011] [\cite=Miller:2011], the devices were formed in a keyhole shape and then fixed in FC-mating sleeves. For electrical access the detectors were glued and bonded to PCBs, as shown in Fig [\ref=fig:fig1](b). Finally, the devices were mounted in a compact Gifford-McMahon cryostat with antireflection coated fibers and coaxial feedthroughs as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1]c.

To evaluate the efficiency of the detectors, a fiber-coupled laser was attenuated to the levels equivalent with 100-150 k photons and then connected to the detectors using a standard FC-FC connector. We used NIST traceable attenuators and powermeters, and the laser power was stable within 1-2 % during the measurements. The measurement setup is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig1]d. We estimate the total measurement errors to be better than ±  4.2  %.

To reach the lowest dark count rate at highest efficiency level, we spool the fiber around a mandrel [\cite=Smirnov:2015] with a diameter of 23 mm. The spooling of the fiber filters the longer wavelength blackbody radiation, coupled into the fiber modes, and hence, the false counts are reduced. However, it also limits the bandwidth of the detector. We characterized the detectors both with and without fiber spooling.

Fig. [\ref=fig:fig2]a, shows a detection pulse from a SNSPD with a recovery time constant of 20.31    ±    0.17  ns. The result of the efficiency measurement for the same detector at 1310  nm is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig2]b. Each point in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig2]b is an average over four measurements each integrated for 100 ms. The efficiency curve saturates at values between 91.5% - 93.3 %. The dark-count rate at >    90  % efficiency level is below 150 Hz. It must be noted that to avoid overestimating the efficiency, we subtract the dark counts and consider the fact that the power measurement was done on an uncoated fiber while the detector is connected to an antireflected coated fiber. The mentioned contribution accounts for about ~    3.6  % which has been deducted from each measurement point (the not-corrected measured peak efficiency is ~    97  %). For more examples of high efficiency detectors see supplementary material.

Before spooling fibers, we characterized the bandwidth of our detector as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig2]c. The measured efficiencies, indicated with black squares, is similar for wavelengths of 1310  nm, 1490  nm and 1625  nm in close agreement with our 3D FDTD simulations, shown with red filled circles. However, the normalized efficiency at 1550  nm is lower. The latter could be due to the air gap between the facet of the fiber and the chip [\cite=Dorenbos:2011] (also see supplementary material). Fig. [\ref=fig:fig2]d represents the results of timing jitter measurement, the fitted data yields a jitter of FWHM    =    51.27  ±  0.20  ps.

For applications in satellite communication [\cite=Yin:2013] [\cite=Vallone:2016] and quantum information processing [\cite=Hadfield:2009], efficient detectors at high detection-rates are highly desired. It has been shown that the recovery time of the detectors is mainly caused by the kinetic inductance of the nanowire [\cite=Kerman:2006]. It has also been shown that the maximum count-rate is not only set by the recovery time of the detector [\cite=Kerman:2013] but also by the readout circuitry. The reason for this is that the readout components can store energy that is released at a timescale much longer than the dead time. At high count-rates this persistent bias current leads to higher effective bias and extra Joule heating, preventing cooldown of the hotspot formed after absorption of photons. To this end a DC coupled circuit [\cite=Kerman:2013] and a resistive network [\cite=Zhao:2014] have been proposed. In this work, a resistive network has been combined with the high efficiency detector to improve the quantum efficiency at higher detection-rates. This is done by letting the extra charge, stored in the readout capacitor, to dissipate through a resistor at the price of reduced output signal.

At high excitation rates, some photons arrive before the detector bias current has fully recovered, resulting in reduced detection probability. This reduction in efficiency depends on bias current and deadtime of the detector and also on the excitation wavelength. Fig. [\ref=fig:fig3]a shows efficiency versus detection-rate under continuous wave excitation for three different wavelengths. As expected, the efficiency is less sensitive to count-rate for photons with higher energy. In the view of continuous wave laser excitation, the arrival time of photons follows Poison distribution, we also characterized our detector with pulsed laser diodes. Fig. [\ref=fig:fig3]b presents the results for pulsed laser measurements. For the case of 50  MHz pulsed excitation, photons are well separated and the efficiency is relatively insensitive to the count-rate of the detector. In Fig. [\ref=fig:fig3]b, a small dip for the cases of excitation at 878 nm and 1310 nm (pulsed at 50 MHz) can be observed which we ascribe to the transition from detecting photons in every second pulse to all consecutive pulses (for more information see supplementary material). Fig. [\ref=fig:fig3]c shows examples of optical pulses, captured with a fast photo-diode, and their corresponding SNSPD detection events. Clearly, even at high detection-rates, for every optical pulse there is only one detection event.

As discussed before, the resistive network designed to increase the detector maximum detection-rate causes reduction in the output signal amplitude which in turn increases timing jitter of the device. Fig. [\ref=fig:fig4]a shows this increase, the timing jitter has increased by ~  31  ps after addition of the network. Timing jitter of SNSPDs depend on bias current, rise time of the detector and the spectrum of the noise of the amplifier. By optimizing the bandwidth, jitter can be reduced. Fig. [\ref=fig:fig4]b repeats the same measurement as Fig. [\ref=fig:fig4]a with optimized bandwidth (see supplementary material for more information). In the later case timing jitter is reduced by more than 17  ps.

The noise level of amplifiers can be further reduced by cooling them. Fig. [\ref=fig:fig4]c shows the measured timing jitter of the detector using a carefully optimized cryogenic amplifier operating at 77 K. The jitter measure with cryogenic amplifier is FWHM    =    48.83    ±    0.22  ps which is even lower than the measured timing jitter before the addition of the resistive network. Finally, by lowering the operating temperature of the amplifier to 30K, improving the critical current of the SNSPD, and lowering its rise time we could drastically improve, for a separate device, the timing jitter and achieved a record low value of FWHM    =    14.80    ±    0.05  ps as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:fig4]d. It should be added that the reported timing jitter includes the measuring instruments contribution (~    4.8  ps, see supplementary material) and the detector shows high efficiencies in O-band (supplementary material). To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of high efficiency single-photon detector with ultra-low timing jitter.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a single photon detector combining very high efficiency, low dark-count rate, low timing jitter and high detection rates. Moreover, our detectors do not require dynamic alignment to optical fibers and operates in a conventional Gifford-McMahon cryostat. The technology presented in this paper can open the way for efficient and high throughput optical communication and demanding quantum optical experiments.
