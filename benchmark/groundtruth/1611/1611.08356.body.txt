On Boundary points at which the squeezing function tends to one

Introduction

Let [formula]. For a domain Ω in [formula] and z0∈Ω, let [formula]. Then the squeezing function [formula] is defined to be

[formula]

Note that 0 < sΩ(z)  ≤  1 for any z∈Ω.

This concept first appeared in [\cite=LSY1] [\cite=LSY2] in the context concerning the holomorphic homogeneous regular manifolds. But the name squeezing function comes from [\cite=Yeung]; this concept is closely related to the concept of "bounded geometry" by Cheng and Yau [\cite=CY]. It is obvious from its construction that the squeezing function is a biholomorphic invariant.

Recent studies have shown:

If a bounded domain Ω in [formula] has a boundary point, say p, about which the boundary is strictly pseudoconvex, then [formula].

J. E. Fornæss asked recently whether its converse is true (cf. [\cite=FW], Sections 1 and 4), i.e., he posed the following question.

If Ω is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, and if [formula], then is the boundary of Ω strictly pseudoconvex at p?

In a recent article, A. Zimmer has shown that the answer is affirmative if the bounded domain is also assumed to be convex [\cite=Zimm].

The main purpose of this article is to present the following result.

Let Ω be a bounded domain in [formula] with smooth pseudoconvex boundary. If p is a boundary point of Ω of finite type, in the sense of D'Angelo [\cite=DAN], and if lim Ω∋z  →  pSΩ(z)  =  1, then ∂Ω is strictly pseudoconvex at p.

We remark that our proof is only for complex dimension 2. It is mainly due to the limitation of current knowledge concerning the convergence of the scaling methods (cf. [\cite=GKK]). If the domain is convex and Kobayashi hyperbolic for instance, then there is no such restriction. Consequently in case the domain is bounded convex, as treated in [\cite=Zimm], our proof-arguments also answer Question [\ref=Fornaess] affirmatively, which we shall put an explication of, in a remark at the end.

On the other hand, as shown recently in [\cite=FW], the answer to Question [\ref=Fornaess] is negative if no other conditions on the bounded domain than the boundary being C2 are assumed. Also the high dimensions can imply some unexpected phenomenon [\cite=FR]. Thus the hypothesis of the our theorem is in some sense reasonable.

Construction of the scaling sequence

Let Ω and the boundary point p∈∂Ω be as in the hypothesis of the theorem.

Let vp be the unit normal vector to ∂Ω at p pointing outward. Then take a sequence {pj}  ⊂  Ω such that p  -  pj  =  tjvp for some tj satisfying

0  <  tj + 1  <  tj for every [formula] and

lim j  →    ∞tj  =  0.

We also set δj: = 2(1  -  sΩ(pj)) for every j. Since lim j  →    ∞sΩ(pj)  =  1 by assumption, there exists, for each j, an injective holomorphic map [formula] such that fj(pj)  =  (0,0) and [formula] for all j.

The next step is to use the dilation sequence [formula] introduced in [\cite=JooSR], Section 2.2. (We remark that this is a mild but necessary modification of Pinchuk's stretching sequence [\cite=BP] [\cite=Pin]). If the type of p is 2k for some integer k, then there is a neighborhood U of p and [formula] satisfying the following properties:

The map αj is the composition (in order) of a translation, a unitary map, a triangular map and a dilation map.

αj(p)  =  (0,0) and αj(pj)  =  ( - 1,0) for all j.

The local defining function ρj of [formula] at (0,0) is represented by

[formula]

where:

Pj is a nonzero real-valued homogeneous subharmonic polynomial of degree 2k with no harmonic terms,

Rj and Qj are real-valued smooth functions satisfying the conditions on the vanishing: order ν(Rj(z,))  >  2k and [formula].

Note that the convergences Pj  →  P̂,Rj  →  0 and Qj  →  0 are uniform on compact subsets of [formula], while P̂ is a nonzero real-valued subharmonic polynomial of degree 2k. This is proved in detail in Lemma 2.4 of [\cite=JooSR]. Consequently, ρj converges uniformly to : =   w  +  P̂(z,) on compact subsets of [formula].

Define σj:αj(Ω)  →  fj(Ω) by [formula]. Note that σj( - 1,0)  =  (0,0) for every j.

Convergence of the "reverse" scaling sequence {σj}

Recall the concept of normal set-convergence introduced in [\cite=GKK], Section 9.2.2; it will give the necessary control for the convergence.

Let Ωj be domains in [formula] for each [formula]. The sequence Ωj is said to converge normally to a domain [formula], if the following two conditions hold:

For any compact set K contained in the interior of [formula] for some positive integer m, K  ⊂  .

For any compact subset K' of [formula], there exists a constant m  >  0 such that [formula].

If Ωj is a sequence of domains in [formula] that converges normally to the domain [formula], then

If a sequence of holomorphic mappings fj:Ωj  →  Ω' from Ωj to another domain Ω' converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula], then its limit is a holomorphic mapping from [formula] into the closure of the domain Ω'.

If a sequence of holomorphic mappings gj:Ω'  →  Ωj converges uniformly on compact subsets of Ω', if [formula] is pseudoconvex, and if there are a point p∈Ω' and a constant c  >  0 so that the inequality | det (dgj|p)|  >  c holds for each j, then lim j  →    ∞gj is a holomorphic mapping from the domain Ω' into [formula].

In our construction, the set-convergences [formula] and αj(Ω)  →   are in accordance with the sense of normal set-convergence with

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is unbounded, so the convergence of the forward scaling sequence {σ- 1j} is not immediately obvious. On the other hand, one easily observes that the inverse sequence (i.e., the reverse scaling sequence) {σj} converges, choosing a subsequence when necessary, by Proposition 3.2 and Montel's theorem. So we take a convergent subsequence and call it {σj} again, and denote the limit map by [formula]. Since [formula], it holds that [formula].

Now we show:

[formula] is a biholomorphic map.

The proof is almost the same as those for Propositions 2.8 and 2.10 of [\cite=JooSR]. However, the surjectivity part of [formula] requires a few, simple but perhaps subtle adjustments. Therefore, we choose to include the detail here.

Suppose that [formula] is not onto. Then there is a boundary point q of () in [formula]. Notice that f- 1j(q) converges to p since p is a peak point of ∂Ω. Denote by qj: = f- 1j(q). Now we construct a new scaling sequence [formula] where αqj is a stretching map (in the sense of Pinchuk) with respect to qj as above. In the same way, there is a subsequential limit map [formula] of {σqj}, where [formula] is the limit domain of the sequence αqj(Ω) in the sense of normal set-convergence. We have already observed that [formula] is 1-1. Taking a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that the uniform convergence holds for σ- 1j  →  - 1 and (σqj)- 1  →  - 1 on compact subsets of () and () respectively. (See Lemma 2.9 in [\cite=JooSR]).

Denote by [formula]. Then the map [formula] is well-defined. Actually, [formula], and this, for each j, is a polynomial automorphism of [formula] with degree less than or equal to 2k. On the other hand, Bj converges to [formula] uniformly on compact subsets of - 1(W). By calculation, B̂ turns out to be a polynomial automorphism of [formula] of degree less than or equal to 2k. Now Proposition 3.2 guarantees that the restriction [formula] is a 1-1 holomorphic map from [formula] into [formula]. In a similar way for the inverse sequence {B- 1j}, the map [formula] is a 1-1 holomorphic map from [formula] into [formula]. Hence B̂:  →   is a biholomorphism.

Denote by [formula]. Then (p')  =  ( - 1,0) by the construction of B̂. This contradicts that (p')∈() and ( - 1,0)  =  q∈∂(()). So the surjectivity of [formula] follows.

Proof of the Theorem [\ref=main]

We are ready to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. Recall that [formula], where P̂ is a nonzero real-valued subharmonic polynomial of degree 2k. Note that the unit ball [formula] is biholomorphic to the Siegel half space [formula]. So a theorem of Oeljeklaus [\cite=Oelj], which says that these two domains must be affinely biholomorphic, implies in particular that P̂(z,)  =  c|z|2 for some c  >  0. Therefore, the origin must have been the boundary point of type 2 in the first place. Since the convergence ρj  →    w  +  c|z|2 is uniform on each jet-level, there exist positive contants c and j0 such that the smallest eigenvalue of the Levi form of each ρj at (0,0) is larger than c whenever j  >  j0. Consequently, the Levi form of ρ at q is strictly positive-definite. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. [formula]

A remark for the convex case

Notice that the scaling sequence converges without difficulties in case the domain is bounded convex. See e.g., [\cite=KK]. If the boundary point p under consideration satisfies the condition  lim Ω∋q  →  psΩ(q) = 1 and if p were of infinite type, then the scaled limit turns out to be a convex domain that contains a one-dimensional disc with a positive radius in its boundary. (cf. [\cite=Zimm], Theorem 3.7).

On the other hand, the preceding arguments imply that this domain has to be biholomorphic to the ball. But this is impossible, for instance by [\cite=Huc]. So the boundary point p has to be of finite type. Notice that our arguments work in all dimensions in this case, as the scaling method for bounded convex domains converges regardless of dimension (cf., e.g., [\cite=KK]). This reconfirms Zimmer's affirmative answer [\cite=Zimm] to Question [\ref=Fornaess] for the smoothly bounded convex domains in [formula] for all n.
