Equivalents of disjunctive Markov's principle

This paper is a small contribution to constructive reverse mathematics. In constructive reverse mathematics we classify, in particular, theorems of classical mathematics (ZF with dependent choice, say) by the fragment of the law of excluded middle required to prove them (in addition to constructive techniques). It is similar, and indeed inspired by, Friedman's programme of reverse mathematics [\cite=Simpson]; however, since we are interested mostly in logical, rather than set theoretical, principles, we take as our base theory full constructive set theory CZF [\cite=AR] possibly with some form of choice (typically dependent choice). See [\cite=BB] [\cite=BV] for the development of constructive mathematics (a la Bishop, BISH) and [\cite=Ish_CRM] for an overview of results in constructive reverse mathematics together with references. We equate BISH with the mathematics of CZF plus dependent choice, in particular based upon intuitionistic logic.

Most weak 'semi-intuitionistic principles' were introduced as equivalent, over BISH, to fundamental properties in analysis; for example, Ishihara introduced BD-[formula] as a logical equivalent of the assertion that every sequentially continuous function is pointwise continuous [\cite=Ish92], and WMP is important for its equivalence with 'every mapping from a complete metric space to a metric space is strongly extensional' [\cite=Ish92]. In contrast, disjunctive Markov's principle--usually stated in terms of binary sequences as

MP[formula]: if α is a binary sequence with at most one nonzero term and such that it is not the case that all terms are 0, then either all the even terms are zero or all the odd terms are zero

--is introduced as a common weakening of Markov's principle--

MP: If α is a binary sequence such that it is impossible for every term to be 0, then there exists n such that α(n) = 1

--and the lesser limited principle of omniscience, and which together with weak Markov's principle is equivalent to the full form of Markov's principle.

There are few equivalents of disjunctive Markov's principal in the literature, probably the most natural of which is the following result due to Mandelkern [\cite=Mandelkern].

MP[formula] is equivalent to the statement 'if [formula] are such that [formula], then {x,y} is closed.'

With a weak form of countable choice (see [\cite=BRS]), MP[formula] is equivalent to

MP[formula]: if x is a real number such that [formula], then either [formula] or [formula].

It is this form of MP[formula] we shall use; if we replace MP[formula] by MP[formula] in what follows (and MP by 'if a is a real number such that [formula], then |a| > 0), then our results do not require any form of the axiom of choice (they are valid in CZF). MP[formula] fails in the sheaf model of continuous functions over the reals (see [\cite=Grayson]).

We argue that MP[formula] is precisely what is required to extract algorithms from a particular class of classical results in elementary Euclidean geometry. In order to introduce our example we need a few definitions. A polygon is given by a finite sequence [formula] of vertices in [formula] such that x0 = xk and no two edges--line segments (without endpoints) joining two consecutive elements of the sequence--intersect. A strictly convex polygon is a polygon such that for any three consecutive vertices xi,xi + 1,xi + 2, the internal angle [formula] is less than π. We associate the polygon given by [formula] with the closure of the interior of some Jordan curve which traces the edges (this is constructively well defined, in particular see [\cite=JCT] for a constructive treatment of the Jordan curve theorem).

For any finite collection S of more than three points in [formula], if no three points are collinear, then there exists a strictly convex polygon with vertices from S and which contains S.

The constructive status of Theorem [\ref=1] depends on the interpretations of 'not collinear' and <   (the latter via the definition of strictly convex polygon). We may define 'not collinear' in either a positive way

three points are non-collinear if there exists ε > 0 such that each point is bound away from the line through the other two points by at least epsilon,

or the negative way

three points are not collinear if it is not the case that they are collinear.

Similarly, we can give <   a strong, positive definition--x < y if there exists a positive rational r such that |x - y| > r, which is the definition we adopt--or the classically equivalent weak definition x < wy if [formula].

We isolate three versions of this theorem:

the constructive version: we use both positive definitions;

the classical version: we take both negative definitions;

an incongruous version: the have the negative definition in the antecedent (that is, of not collinear) and the positive definition, of <  , in the consequent.

It turns out the classical version is equivalent to MP[formula]; whence disjunctive Markov's principle is precisely what is required to extract a valid algorithm from an appropriate classical proof of this theorem. The constructive version is, as the names suggests, fully constructive, and the incongruous version is equivalent to the full form of Markov's principle.

We need some basic definitions and notation. For convenience we adopt the classical definition of distinct: elements x,y of some set with equality are distinct if [formula]; in a metric space this is weaker than inequality, x  ≠  y if ρ(x,y) > 0. For two distinct points [formula], we denote by La,b the line passing through both a,b, and we denote by

[formula]

P=.

[formula]

ρ(x,S)=inf{ρ(x,s):s∈ S}

[formula]

is minimal. We show that [formula] is contained in L+x0,x1. It follows from our choice of δ that S is contained in [formula], so any point of S contained in L-x0,x1 must be in the wedge between L and the ray from x0 through x1. This contradicts the construction of x1 to minimise θ; thus, by Lemma [\ref=lemma], [formula] is contained in L+x1,x1. We can now repeat the construction of x1 with L replaced by Lx0,x1, oriented from x0 to x1, to construct a x2 such that [formula] is contained within [formula]. The angle [formula] is less than π since c∈L+a,b. Since this contradicts the construction of x1 to minimise θ, by Lemma [\ref=lemma], [formula] is contained in L+x1,x1. We can now repeat the construction of x1 with L replaced by Lx0,x1, oriented from x0 to x1, to construct x2 such that [formula] is contained within [formula]. The angle [formula] is less than π since c∈L+a,b.

Continuing in this manner we construct a finite sequence [formula] such that   <  π for each [formula]. We claim that x0 = xk for some k < |S|. For otherwise, by the pigeon-hole principle, some other element s occurs twice. Let xi,xj (i < j) be two consecutive occurrences of s; then [formula] is, by construction, a strictly convex polygon which does not contain x0--this is a contradiction since each internal angle of [formula] is maximal by construction. Let k > 0 be minimal such that x0 = xk. Without loss of generality, the convex hull of [formula] contains the origin. Then [formula] is the desired polygon; the construction guarantees that this polygon contains S since it is equal to the closure of

[formula]

A polygon [formula] is almost strictly convex if for any three consecutive vertices xi,xi + 1,xi + 2, [formula]. The proof of the classical version from MP[formula] requires no new ideas.

The following are equivalent.

MP[formula].

For any finite collection of more than three points in [formula], if no three points are collinear, then there exists an almost strictly convex polygon with vertices from S and which contains S.

Suppose that MP[formula] holds. The proof of Proposition [\ref=1con], together with the second part of Lemma [\ref=lemma], shows that such a polygon cannot fail to exist; Lemma [\ref=lemma] together with MP[formula] allows us to find this polygon using an exhaustive search.

For the converse, let [formula] be such that [formula] and consider the subset

[formula]

If a > 0, then the almost strictly convex polygon must have each element of S as a vertex, and if a < 0 the set of vertices must be [formula]. Hence by counting the vertex set of the polygon from the conclusion of (ii) we can conclude either that [formula], if there are five vertices, or [formula] if there are four vertices.

The source of disjunctive Markov's principle in the above argument is simple. MP[formula] is equivalent to 'for all x,y,z in [formula] which are not collinear and any normal [formula] to the line L through y and z, either [formula] or [formula] for the unique decomposition of x into a point on L plus [formula].' Any argument which contains this result will require MP[formula]. In particular, the classical formulations of many simple geometric results (like the above) that one might expect to be constructive. This also applies to higher dimensions and separations using hyperplanes.

The characterisation of the final version is again similar; Markov's principle is really only required to prove the angle is indeed less than π.

The following are equivalent.

MP.

For any finite collection of more than three points in [formula], if no three points are collinear, then there exists a strictly convex polygon with vertices from S and which contains S.

The direction from (i) to (ii) follows from Proposition [\ref=1con]. The converse is similar to the previous theorem except we now consider the set S = {( - 1, - 1),( - 1,1),(1,1),(1, - 1),(1 + a,0),( - 1 + a,0)}. The strictly convex polynomial must contain either (1 + a,0) or ( - 1 + a,0), and since the internal angle at this node is less than π, we can bound a away from 0.
