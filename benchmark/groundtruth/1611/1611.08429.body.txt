Introduction

The starting point for this work is a result of Fricain, Hartmann and Ross [\cite=FHR], which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a function g to multiply a model space Kθ into another model space Kφ (all notation and definitions will be given later in this section). This in turn was motivated by a more restrictive version of this question due to Crofoot [\cite=crofoot].

The main result of [\cite=FHR] says that w multiplies Kθ into Kφ if and only if: (i) w multiplies the function S*θ into Kφ (here S* denotes the backward shift), and (ii) w multiplies Kθ into H2 (this may be expressed as a Carleson measure condition).

Now model spaces are kernels of particular Toeplitz operators, indeed [formula], and thus the question may be posed more generally for kernels of Toeplitz operators. We may also ask whether more general test functions can be used, other than S*θ.

In this paper we address these questions, obtaining the result above as an immediate corollary. To do this we need to bring in some of the theory of Toeplitz kernels, particularly ideas developed by the authors in [\cite=CP14] [\cite=CMP]. That work was done in the context of Hardy spaces on the half-plane, and we reformulate it for the disc, showing also how the multiplier problem is solved for the half-plane.

In Section [\ref=sec:2], we establish the notion of minimal kernels and maximal vectors for kernels of Toeplitz operators on H2, and then use these to give a characterization of multipliers from one Toeplitz kernel to another by using the maximal vectors as test functions. From this we easily recover results on model spaces as special cases.

In Section [\ref=sec:3], we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for surjective multipliers between Toeplitz kernels, recovering Crofoot's result as a very special case.

In Section [\ref=sec:4], we give a brief discussion of the situation for the upper half-plane, which can be obtained independently or by using the unitary equivalence of the corresponding Hardy spaces.

Notation

We use H2 to denote the standard Hardy space of the unit disc [formula], which embeds isometrically into [formula], where [formula] denotes the unit circle with normalized Lebesgue measure m. Its orthogonal complement is written [formula] or [formula]. Here z denotes the independent variable. The space H∞ is the Banach algebra of bounded analytic functions on [formula], while [formula] denotes the space of all analytic functions on [formula].

We refer the reader to [\cite=duren] [\cite=hoffman] [\cite=koosis] [\cite=nik] for standard results on Hardy spaces and the factorization of Hardy-class functions into inner and outer factors.

An observation that we shall use several times is that f∈H2 if and only if [formula], and likewise [formula] if and only if [formula].

The shift operator S:H2  →  H2 is the operator of multiplication by the independent variable z.

The Toeplitz operator Tg with symbol [formula] is the operator on H2 defined by Tgf = PH2(gf), for f∈H2, where PH2 denotes the orthogonal projection from [formula] onto H2. If θ is an inner function, then [formula] is the model space [formula], which is invariant under the backward shift S*.

For [formula] we write [formula] for the space of multipliers [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula].

Multipliers and maximal vectors

For a function [formula] we write [formula] for the minimal Toeplitz kernel containing k; that is, [formula] for some v∈L∞, with [formula], while [formula] for every w∈L∞ such that [formula].

We say that k is a maximal vector for [formula] if [formula].

The existence of minimal kernels and maximal vectors was established in [\cite=CP14] in the context of the upper half-plane. Let us sketch the corresponding argument for the disc.

Suppose that k = θp, where θ is inner and p is outer. Then we assert that [formula], where [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula].

Now suppose that [formula] for some w∈L∞, and that [formula]. Thus [formula] and [formula].

Then [formula]; that is, gw lies in L2, and [formula], which means that [formula] is in the Smirnov class (the ratio of an H1 function and an outer H2 function) as well as [formula]. By the generalized maximum principle (e.g. [\cite=duren],[\cite=nik]) it is therefore in H2 . Thus [formula] and [formula], and so [formula].

Moreover, by [\cite=sarason94], every Toeplitz kernel K is [formula] for some inner function θ and outer function p and thus [formula].

We are now ready to state a theorem characterizing multipliers of Toeplitz kernels. Recall that μ is a Carleson measure for a subspace X of H2 if there is a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

The natural choices for X will be Toeplitz kernels, including model spaces. Note that, since every nontrivial Toeplitz kernel contains an outer function, multipliers must themselves be holomorphic in [formula].

Let [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are nontrivial. Then a function [formula] lies in [formula] if and only if (i) [formula] for some (and hence all) maximal vectors k of [formula]; (ii) [formula]; that is |w|2  dm is a Carleson measure for [formula].

Clearly, the two conditions are necessary. So assume that (i) and (ii) hold, and write k = θp, where θ is inner and p is outer. Now [formula], as detailed above, and thus without loss of generality we may take [formula].

We have that [formula], since [formula]. Suppose now that [formula], so that [formula]. Now

[formula]

Then [formula], since [formula] by the Carleson condition. Also wkh and fg are in [formula] so [formula] is in the Smirnov class of the disc as well as [formula]. Once again, we deduce that [formula] and so [formula], and finally [formula].

Note that if k is not a maximal vector of [formula], then k cannot be used as a test function for multipliers from [formula]; for example, the function [formula] is not a multiplier from [formula] into [formula], even though [formula].

In fact, we can characterise all the maximal vectors for a Toeplitz kernel, as follows.

Let [formula] be such that [formula] is non-trivial. Then k is a maximal vector for [formula] if and only if k∈H2 and [formula], where p is outer in H2.

Note first that if [formula] is non-trivial, then [formula] for some nonzero f∈H2, and so g  ≠  0 almost everywhere and we can define g- 1.

Now if [formula], then we have [formula], where p∈H2. Also p is outer, since if p = φq, where φ is inner and non-constant, and q is outer, then [formula], which contradicts the assumption.

Conversely, if [formula], where p is outer, then [formula]. If also [formula] with h∈L∞, then [formula], and if [formula] we have [formula], so [formula].

Then

[formula]

which is in [formula] and the Smirnov class, hence in H2. Thus [formula] and [formula]; so [formula] and [formula].

In the special case of a model space, we obtain immediately a disc version of [\cite=CMP].

Let θ be inner. Then [formula] if and only if k∈H2 and [formula], where p is outer in H2.

Take [formula] and apply Theorem [\ref=thm:maxtg].

By considering two model spaces and a particular choice of w we obtain the following result from [\cite=FHR].

[\cite=FHR] Let θ and φ be inner. A function [formula] lies in M(Kθ,Kφ) if and only if (i) wS*θ∈Kφ, and (ii) |w|2  dm is a Carleson measure for Kθ. In the case that w∈H2 these conditions are equivalent to (iii) [formula] and (ii) holds.

Since [formula], where [formula], which is outer, we see that [formula]. Thus everything except the equivalence with (iii) follows directly from Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Finally, note that (i) asserts that [formula] and (iii) asserts that [formula]. These conditions are equivalent since [formula], where the last factor is invertible in [formula].

On the other hand, the reproducing kernel, used as a test function in many other contexts, beginning perhaps with [\cite=bonsall], is not maximal for Kθ. For with

[formula]

we have

[formula]

which is not outer in general.

Carleson measures for [formula] may be better understood if we use the fact that [formula] is nearly invariant, and thus by Hitt's result [\cite=hitt] [formula] for some isometric multiplier F (which is outer) and θ inner.

We require w to satisfy

[formula]

for each k∈Kθ. Thus the study of Carleson measures for Toeplitz kernels reduces to that of the special case where the Toeplitz kernel is a model space. There is information on how to find an appropriate θ in Sarason's paper [\cite=sarason94].

Carleson measures for model spaces are not fully understood, although there are partial results in [\cite=cohn] [\cite=VT].

In [\cite=FHR] there is a supplementary theorem describing the space [formula]. Starting with Theorem [\ref=thm:main], we immediately have the following general result on noting that the Carleson measure condition is redundant for bounded w.

Let [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are nontrivial. Then for [formula] the following conditions are equivalent. (i) [formula]; (ii) w∈H∞ and [formula] for some maximal vector [formula]. If w∈H2, and if [formula] contains a maximal vector k with [formula], then conditions (i) and (ii) are equivalent to (iii) [formula].

For model spaces, we therefore recover the main theorem on bounded multipliers from [\cite=FHR].

[\cite=FHR] Let θ and φ be inner functions and let w∈H2. Then the following are equivalent: (i) w∈Mb(Kθ,Kφ); (ii) [formula]; (iii) [formula].

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is contained in Corollary [\ref=cor:fhr]. The equivalence with (iii) follows since S*θ is a maximal vector for Kθ that is invertible in [formula].

Surjective multipliers

The original context of Crofoot's work [\cite=crofoot], continued by Fricain, Hartmann and Ross [\cite=FHR], is that in which the multiplication operator between two model spaces is surjective. We may obtain similar results in the more general context of Toeplitz kernels.

Let [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are nontrivial. Then a function [formula] satisfies [formula] if and only if (i) [formula] and [formula]; (ii) for some (or indeed, for every) maximal vector [formula], the function wk is a maximal vector for [formula].

Suppose that the conditions are satisfied. Then by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] w is a multiplier from [formula] into [formula] and w- 1 is a multiplier from [formula] into [formula]. Since the multiplication operator is injective, we see that we have [formula].

Conversely, if [formula], then condition (i) is clearly satisfied, and if [formula] is any maximal vector, we have that [formula] by Theorem [\ref=thm:main]; hence [formula] and wk is maximal in [formula].

From this we may extract the following corollary.

Let [formula], let k be a maximal vector for [formula] and suppose that [formula]. If [formula] is a Toeplitz kernel, then it equals [formula].

It turns out that we can obtain a very explicit formula relating g,h and w in the case when [formula]. To do this, we start with the very special case [formula], which is of independent interest.

For [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are nontrivial, we have [formula] if and only if there are outer functions p,q∈H2 such that [formula].

If [formula], then for a maximal vector k we have [formula] and [formula], where p,q∈H2; thus [formula]. Now p (and likewise q) is outer, since if p = θu, with θ inner (nontrivial) and u outer, we have [formula], so [formula]. However [formula] is strictly contained in [formula], since it does not contain θk, which is a contradiction since [formula].

Conversely, if [formula], with p,q outer, then for [formula] we have [formula] for some v∈H2 and so [formula]. Thus [formula], and this lies in both L2 and the Smirnov class, hence (by an argument used several times above) in H2. So [formula]; that is, [formula]. By a similar argument the reverse inclusion holds, and the kernels are equal.

Let [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are nontrivial. Then [formula] if and only if [formula] , [formula] and

[formula]

for some outer functions p,q∈H2.

Note that w must be outer, as functions in a Toeplitz kernel cannot share a common inner factor, since if [formula] and θ is inner with f / θ∈H2, then [formula].

Now let k = θu be a maximal vector for [formula], where θ is inner and u is outer. Then [formula]. We write [formula]. Also the inner-outer factorization of wk, which is a maximal vector for [formula], is wk = θ(wu), so we have [formula]. We write [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:3nov11] we have outer functions r and s such that [formula]. So

[formula]

Finally, by Lemma [\ref=lem:3nov11] we have [\eqref=eq:hlinkedtog].

For the converse, we see that [\eqref=eq:hlinkedtog] implies that [formula]. Then if [formula] we have [formula] and so [formula]. Also if [formula] then [formula], and so [formula].

In the case of model spaces, suppose that wKθ = Kφ; then we apply the above results to [formula] and [formula], so we have [formula]. Now [formula] (indeed it is unimodular), but it also equals φp / q from [\eqref=eq:hlinkedtog], and this is in the Smirnov class; so it lies in H∞ and is inner.

Thus [formula], and so [formula], with [formula] and |α| = 1, which is Crofoot's result.

The upper half-plane

The results on Toeplitz kernels in [\cite=CP14] [\cite=CMP] were originally derived for the Hardy space [formula] of the upper half-plane. There are additional motivations here, in that Paley-Wiener spaces appear naturally in the context of model spaces corresponding to the inner functions θ(s) = eiλs for λ  >  0: for this and other motivations we refer to the introduction of [\cite=CP17].

Recall that we have the relation [formula], and [formula] if and only if [formula].

Moreover it is well known (see, e.g. [\cite=Par]) that [formula] for some 1  ≤  p  <    ∞   if and only if the function Vpg defined by

[formula]

lies in [formula]. Indeed, Vp is an isometric map which preserves the corresponding Hardy spaces, with [formula] mapping to [formula].

The analogue of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is the following. We now use m to refer to Lebesgue measure on [formula], and Tg etc. to refer to Toeplitz operators on [formula].

Let [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] are nontrivial. Then a function [formula] lies in [formula] if and only if (i) [formula] for some (and hence all) maximal vectors k of [formula]; (ii) [formula]; that is |w|2  dm is a Carleson measure for [formula].

Clearly, the two conditions are necessary. So assume that (i) and (ii) hold, and write k = θp, where θ is inner and p is outer. Now [formula], as detailed above, and thus without loss of generality we may take [formula].

We have that [formula], since [formula]. Suppose now that [formula], so that [formula]. Now

[formula]

Then [formula], since [formula] by the Carleson condition.

Also wkh and fg are in [formula] so [formula] is in the Smirnov class of the half-plane (the ratio of an [formula] function and an outer H2 function) as well as [formula]. The generalized maximum principle applies also to the half-plane, as can be seen using the isometric equivalences in [\eqref=eq:isom]. We conclude that [formula] and so [formula], and finally [formula].

The method of proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:maxtg] shows that the maximal vectors for a nontrivial Toeplitz kernel [formula] are functions of the form [formula], where [formula] outer. Maximal vectors for model spaces [formula] have already been characterized in [\cite=CMP] as functions in [formula] of the form [formula] with p outer. One such is k(s) = (θ(s) - θ(i))  /  (s - i), the backward shift of the function θ, although θ itself is not in [formula]. Since [formula] for [formula] we see that this k is an appropriate test function to use.

One special case of interest is when [formula] consists entirely of bounded functions, since then any H2 function w automatically satisfies the Carleson condition in Theorems [\ref=thm:main] and [\ref=thm:main2]: this property is discussed for model spaces in [\cite=CMP]. For the disc, Kθ  ⊂  H∞ if and only if Kθ is finite-dimensional, that is, θ is rational, but for the half-plane there are other possibilities, for example θ(s) = eiλs with λ  >  0. We refer to [\cite=CMP] for further details.

Finally, we remark that Theorems [\ref=thm:3.1] and [\ref=thm:3.4] hold in the case of the half-plane with obvious modifications.
