How to Find Gravitationally Lensed Type Ia Supernovae

Introduction

Constraining H0, w, and Ωm with lensing time delays is a key goal of modern precision cosmology [\citep=treu2010]. Currently, high-quality time delay measurements have only been obtained for quasars and active galactic nucleii [\citep=schechter97] [\citep=kundic97] [\citep=vuissoz08] [\citep=suyu13]. However, other kinds of variable sources are, in principle, better suited for the job. Using time delays from lensed supernovae to measure H0 was first proposed by [\cite=refsdal64], and since then it has been realized that Type Ia supernovae ( SNe Ia) have many advantages over AGN and quasars as time delay indicators. Because they are standardizable candles, strongly lensed SNe Ia can be used to directly determine the lensing magnification factor μ, which breaks the degeneracy between the lens potential and the Hubble constant [\citep=oguri03]. Also, because they possess exceptionally well-characterized spectral sequences [\citep=nugent02] [\citep=salt2] [\citep=rui13], time delays are far less onerous to extract from SNe Ia than from AGN and quasars, which show considerable variation in light curve morphology from event to event. In addition, the well known spectral energy distributions (SED) of SNe Ia allow one to correct for extinction along the paths of each SN Ia image - a huge advantage over AGN and quasars.

Despite these advantages, several challenges face SNe Ia as tools for time delay measurements. First, multiply imaged SNe Ia are rarer than multiply imaged quasars and AGN. Whereas the number of robust time delays from quasars is now in the double digits, only one multiply imaged SN Ia--iPTF16geu [\citep=goobar16]--has ever been found. Before this serendipitous event, only a multiply imaged core-collapse SN [\citep=refsdal_discovery] [\citep=refsdal_classification] and a few lensed, but not multiply imaged, SNe Ia had been discovered [\citep=cluster1] [\citep=cluster2] [\citep=cluster3]. Another challenge is that most SNe Ia are visible for only days after they explode, whereas AGN and quasars can be monitored for variability over much longer time scales. Because high-resolution imaging or spectroscopy while an SN Ia is still active is necessary to measure a time delay, this creates pressure to identify strongly lensed SNe Ia as soon after explosion as possible. As an example of the reality of this challenge, {[\cite=quimby14] classified an event as a lensed SN Ia which was previously thought to be a new type of superluminous supernova [\citep=2013ApJ...767..162C]. However, the classification was performed well after the event had faded and thus neither the properties of the lens system nor H0 could be constrained. Finally, most strong gravitational lenses produce images that are separated by less than the resolution of ground-based optical surveys [\citep=oguri06]. Images of iPTF16geu were detected just 0.3'' away from the center of a z = 0.16 quiescent galaxy, yet the initial discovery was performed on an instrument with a characteristic PSF of 2.5''.

In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting a new technique for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates. Our goal is to enable transient surveys to systematically search for multiply imaged SNe Ia in their data, and to make strongly lensed SNe Ia viable tools for industrial precision cosmology. The method can be implemented in a real-time search pipeline to rapidly identify active strongly lensed SNe Ia, and it can be applied to archival data for retroactive searches. In Section [\ref=sec:method], we present the technique and discuss its sources of contamination. In Section [\ref=sec:rates], we apply the technique to a Monte Carlo simulation of the source and lens populations to estimate its multiply imaged SN Ia yields for the upcoming transient searches of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We discuss the the implications of our method in Section [\ref=sec:discussion] and conclude in Section [\ref=sec:conclusion]. Throughout this paper we assume a [\cite=planck15] cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.6925, Ωm = 0.3075, h = 0.6774, and Ωb = 0.0486.

The Method

We consider the strong gravitational lensing of SNe Ia by quiescent (E/S0) galaxies. Three properties of quiescent galaxies are useful to identify strongly lensed SNe Ia. First, SNe Ia are the only type of supernovae that have ever been observed to occur in quiescent galaxies [\citep=riess01] [\citep=maozreview]. Second, the absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia in quiescent galaxies are remarkably homogenous, even without correcting for their colors or lightcurve shapes [formula], and some tend to be slightly underluminous [\citep=filippenko89]. Finally, due to the sharp 4000Å break in their spectra, quiescent galaxies tend to provide very accurate photometric redshifts from large-scale multi-color galaxy surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [\citep=sdss] and the ongoing Dark Energy Survey [\citep=des].

A high-cadence, wide-field imaging survey can leverage these facts to systematically search for strongly lensed SNe Ia in the following way. First, by spatially cross-matching its list of supernova candidates with a catalog of quiescent galaxies for which secure photometric redshifts have been obtained, supernovae that appear to be hosted by quiescent galaxies can be identified. Empirically, it is very likely that these supernovae are Type Ia. Not all galaxies with secure photometric redshifts are quiescent; some can show signs of ongoing star formation, in which case they may host core-collapse supernovae that can contaminate the sample. For this reason we follow [\cite=tojeiro13] and select quiescent galaxies with the requirement that in addition to secure photometric redshifts (i.e., [formula]), the rest-frame g - r color of the galaxies be greater than 0.65 mag to ensure that they are "red and dead."

Distance modulii to the supernovae can be computed using the photometric redshifts, assuming a standard ΛCDM cosmology to infer the absolute magnitudes. Because SNe Ia hosted in quiescent galaxies are expected to be normal to underluminous, their absolute magnitudes should be no brighter than - 19.5 in B (see Figure [\ref=fig:hist]). If a supernova candidate hosted in an elliptical galaxy has an absolute magnitude that is far brighter than this, there is a strong chance that it is not actually in that galaxy, but is instead a background supernova lensed by the apparent host. Therefore, requiring:

[formula]

will produce a catalog of lensed SN Ia candidates, where mX is the peak apparent magnitude of the supernovae in filter X, μD(zph) is the ΛCDM distance modulus evaluated at the photometric redshift of the apparent host galaxy, KBX is the cross-filter K-correction from the rest-frame B-band to the observer frame X-band [\citep=kim96], and MB is the inferred rest-frame B-band absolute magnitude of the supernova. This is simply a statement that any supernova found to be brighter than an SN Ia at the photometrically determined distance to its potential quiescent host could be a lensed SN Ia. The magnification μ necessary for this method to be sensitive to various lensing systems is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:mag].

Applying this technique to a cross-match of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) transients and SDSS galaxies satisfying the above criteria would have led to the discovery of iPTF16geu, as it appeared several magnitudes too bright to be associated with its host in a zph = 0.21 lens galaxy. Although PTF has over a billion detections of variability in its transient database, performing the above cuts led to a catalog of only a few hundred transients. These are easy to vet by eye and will be the subject of a future paper.

An important property of this search technique is that it does not require the ability to resolve the lensed images to perform discovery. Once lensed SN Ia candidates are identified, they can be confirmed using high-resolution imaging, e.g., Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics (LGSAO) or space-based imaging such as HST or, in the future, by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope (WFIRST). If a a retroactive search is being performed, then high-resolution imaging will yield lensed images of the supernova host galaxy, which provides strong indirect evidence for the lensed transient. Finally, if the supernova is still active, then a spectrum can confirm its redshift, and reveal features of the host and lens galaxies.

The greatest source of contamination for this technique is AGN. AGN light curves can occasionally resemble those of supernovae, and they can have MB  <   - 20, so spectroscopic followup might be necessary to distinguish between the two. To reduce AGN contamination, one can cross-match lens candidates against e.g., the [\cite=brescia15] SDSS AGN catalog. Finally, highly magnified core-collapse (MB  ~   - 17) supernovae behind the apparent host galaxies may also contaminate the results returned by the method. The rates of this background are expected to be much lower than the signal, as they require roughly an order of magnitude more magnification to reach the same MB.

Yields for Planned Surveys

[\cite=om10] carried out detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the gravitationally lensed supernova and quasar yields of several cadenced optical imaging surveys, including LSST. They predicted that LSST should find roughly 45 multiply imaged SNe Ia over 10 years, but they assumed that only resolved systems (image separation >  0.5'' for LSST) could be discovered. In this section, we carry out analogous rate forecasts using the candidate identification technique presented in Section [\ref=sec:method], which is sensitive to unresolved systems. We develop a statistical model of the source and lens populations and then perform a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the yields for LSST and ZTF.

Lens Modeling

In this section, we describe the lens galaxy population model that we use to predict lensing rates in Section [\ref=sec:mc]. We assume that the mass distribution of the lens galaxies is described by a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid model [\cite=kormann94], which has shown excellent agreement with observations [\citep=more16] [\citep=koopmans09]. The convergence κ of the SIE model is given by:

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the above equations, σ is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy, e is its ellipticity, and λ(e) is its so-called "dynamical normalization," a parameter related to three-dimensional shape. In general, determining the dynamical normalization is complex, so here we make the simplifying assumption that there are an equal number of oblate and prolate galaxies, which [\cite=chae03] showed implies λ(e)≃1. As in [\cite=oguri08], we assume e follows a truncated normal distribution on the interval

[formula]

SN Ia Modeling

SNe Ia exhibit a redshift-dependent volumetric rate and an intrinsic dispersion in rest-frame MB. In our model of the SN Ia population, we take the redshift dependent SN Ia rate from [\cite=2000MNRAS.319..549S]. We assume that the peak rest-frame MB is normally distributed with μ  =   - 19.2 and σ  =  0.2. To realize SN Ia light curves, we employ the implementation of the one-component SN Ia spectral template of [\cite=nugent02] provided by [\cite=sncosmo], which automatically allows one to compute the cross-filter K-corrections in Equation [\ref=eq:cut]. The template is normalized by scaling it up or down to produce the desired MB. For simplicity, we assume that, on average, the SNe Ia suffer no extinction.

Monte Carlo Simulation

We carried out a Monte Carlo simulation of the lens and source populations to forecast the yields of multiply imaged SNe Ia for LSST and ZTF. To perform the simulation, parameters describing lens galaxies were realized at random from their underlying distributions. Figure [\ref=fig:galaxydist] shows one- and two-dimensional histograms of σ and z realized for lens galaxies in the simulation. For computational considerations, 105 galaxies were realized rather than the full Ngal  =  3.8  ×  108. Assuming the galaxies were uniformly distributed on the sky, the average area on the sky "occupied" by a single galaxy was [formula] arcsec2. Thus our simulation covered about 0.02% of the sky.

For each lens galaxy, an effective lensing area of influence was estimated as a 2 box centered on the galaxy, where θE, max is given by Equation [\ref=eq:einrad] with Dls  /  Ds  =  1. This box size was chosen to be large enough to accommodate the effects of ellipticity and external shear. One year's worth of SNe Ia was realized from the underlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions in proportion to the area of this box for each galaxy, at a rate amplified at all redshifts by a factor of 5  ×  104 to reduce shot noise. SNe Ia with zSN  <  zl were rejected. For each remaining source, we solved the lens equation using glafic  [\citep=glafic] to determine the magnification and image multiplicity.

Assuming that the true redshift of each lens galaxy was known, the peak MB implied by the redshift of the lens ("apparent host") was calculated for each multiply imaged system according to Equation [\ref=eq:cut]. Multiply imaged SNe Ia that satisfied MB  <   - 20 and mX  <  mlim,X, where mlim,X is the 5σ limiting magnitude of the survey in filter X, were counted as "detections."

Table [\ref=tab:surveys] shows the survey parameters and multiply imaged SN Ia yields for i -  and z-band in LSST, and an R-band search in ZTF. We chose z-band over i-band for our nominal LSST search because, even though i-band has a higher limiting magnitude, the drop in rest-frame SN Ia flux below 4000Å strongly diminishes the ability to discover them at z > 1. Figure [\ref=fig:zdist] shows the redshift distribution of multiply imaged SNe Ia that can be discovered by LSST using the method presented in Section [\ref=sec:method]. We find that, in total, LSST should be sensitive to 500 multiply imaged SNe Ia in a z-band search, a factor of 11.1 greater than the LSST yield presented in [\cite=om10]. We also find that ZTF should discover about 10 multiply imaged SNe Ia in a 3-year R-band search.

Discussion

Given that this technique will increase the detection of lensed SNe Ia in LSST by an order of magnitude and yield a few discoveries per year in ZTF, we now focus our attention on potential improvements to this method as well as follow-up plans for these future discoveries.

The most obvious improvement to this method is that one can not only use the incongruous brightness of a candidate supernova to identify it as a potential lens candidate, but its photometric evolution as well. Even while not considering the fact that a multiply imaged supernova will be the supposition of a few time-shifted lightcurves, both the shape of a lensed SN Ia lightcurve as well as its colors will point to a supernova which is incompatible with its purported host galaxy and is at higher redshift. Thus one should be able to relax the constraint in Equation [\ref=eq:cut] and use all the information in the transient's lightcurve to signal the detection of a lensed candidate. Furthermore, one could relax the requirement that one look at only "red and dead" galaxies and take a statistical approach which looks at the probability of the candidate being some form of superluminous supernova at the redshift of the host or a lensed supernova behind it. Given the rarity of either of such events, the contamination will likely be small and could easily be screened via rapid follow-up spectroscopy on 8m class telescopes. Likewise lensed core-collapse supernovae could be discovered via similar techniques.

Turning our attention to follow-up, the major difference between the work presented here and that of [\cite=om10] is the fact that the vast majority of the SNe Ia discovered via this method will have unresolved supernova images. Thus, while the survey itself will provide an absolute measurement of the total magnification, follow-up resources with higher resolution will be required to measure the relative magnification of each of the lensed supernova images. Space based facilities such as HST, JWST and WFIRST [\citep=2015JPhCS.610a2007G], given its proposed low-resolution IFU spectrograph [\citep=2014AAS...22334104P], are ideally set up to make these measurements from the optical through near-IR. However, even ground-based LGSAO would be well suited for these measurements in the near-IR, though more work will need to be carried out on an optimal method for subtracting out the underlying lens system and supernova host from the supernova images.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a simple, new method for discovering strongly gravitationally lensed SNe Ia in high-cadence, wide-field imaging surveys. We have calculated the nominal multiply-imaged SN Ia discovery rates for LSST and ZTF, and found them to be roughly an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates. Due to its effectiveness and ease of implementation, this technique will greatly increase the utility of gravitationally lensed SNe Ia as cosmological probes. As such, a renewed focus should be placed on their role in cosmological studies and how to maximize their scientific return.
