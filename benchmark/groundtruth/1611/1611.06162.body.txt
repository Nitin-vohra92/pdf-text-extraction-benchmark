Strong approximation of sets of finite perimeter in metric spaces

Introduction

It is well known in the Euclidean setting that a set of finite perimeter can be approximated in a weak sense by sets with smooth boundaries, see e.g. [\cite=AFP]. In the setting of a much more general metric space, it was shown in [\cite=ADG] that a set of finite perimeter can be approximated in the L1-sense by sets whose boundaries are sufficiently regular that their Minkowski contents converge to the perimeter of the set.

On the other hand, fairly little seems to be known about approximating sets of finite perimeter in the [formula] norm. In the Euclidean setting, this type of result was given in [\cite=TQG], where it was shown that given a set E of finite perimeter in an open set Ω and ε > 0, the set E can be approximated in the [formula]-norm by a set F whose boundary [formula] is contained in a finite union of C1 hypersurfaces, and so that [formula], where ∂*F is the measure theoretic boundary.

In this paper we show a similar result in a metric space equipped with a doubling measure that supports a Poincaré inequality. More precisely, if Ω  ⊂  X is an open set and E  ⊂  X is a set of finite perimeter in Ω, and ε > 0, we show that there exists a set F  ⊂  X with

[formula]

where H is the codimension 1 Hausdorff measure. This is given in Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter]. This is a partial generalization of [\cite=TQG] to the metric setting, and in fact a partial improvement already in the Euclidean setting, since we are able to show that [formula] is zero instead of just being small. This is a fairly strong regularity requirement on the boundary, since in general the topological boundary of a set of finite perimeter can be much bigger than the measure theoretic boundary, see Example [\ref=ex:enlarged_rationals]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter] is heavily based on a quasicontinuity-type result for [formula] functions given in [\cite=LaSh].

Notation and background

In this section we introduce the necessary notation and assumptions.

In this paper, (X,d,μ) is a complete metric space equipped with a Borel regular outer measure μ satisfying a doubling property, that is, there is a constant Cd  ≥  1 such that

[formula]

for every ball B = B(x,r) with center x∈X and radius r > 0. Sometimes we abbreviate αB(x,r): = B(x,αr), α > 0. We assume that X consists of at least two points. By iterating the doubling condition, we obtain that for any x∈X and y∈B(x,R) with 0 < r  ≤  R <   ∞  , we have

[formula]

where C  ≥  1 and Q > 0 only depend on the doubling constant Cd. In general, C  ≥  1 will denote a constant whose particular value is not important for the purposes of this paper, and might differ between each occurrence. When we want to specify that a constant C depends on the parameters [formula] we write [formula]. Unless otherwise specified, all constants only depend on the space X, more precisely on the doubling constant Cd, the constants CP,λ associated with the Poincaré inequality defined below, and [formula].

A complete metric space with a doubling measure is proper, that is, closed and bounded sets are compact. Since X is proper, for any open set Ω  ⊂  X we define [formula] to be the space of functions that are Lipschitz in every [formula]. Here [formula] means that Ω' is open and that [formula] is a compact subset of Ω. Other local spaces of functions are defined similarly.

For any set A  ⊂  X and 0 < R <   ∞  , the restricted spherical Hausdorff content of codimension 1 is defined by

[formula]

We define the above also for R =   ∞   by requiring ri  <    ∞  . The codimension 1 Hausdorff measure of a set A  ⊂  X is given by For any outer measure ν on X, the codimension 1 Minkowski content of a set A  ⊂  X is defined by

[formula]

The measure theoretic boundary ∂*E of a set E  ⊂  X is the set of points x∈X at which both E and its complement have positive upper density, i.e.

[formula]

The measure theoretic interior and exterior of E are defined respectively by

[formula]

and

[formula]

A curve γ is a rectifiable continuous mapping from a compact interval into X. A nonnegative Borel function g on X is an upper gradient of an extended real-valued function u on X if for all curves γ on X, we have

[formula]

where x and y are the end points of γ. We interpret |u(x) - u(y)| =   ∞   whenever at least one of |u(x)|, |u(y)| is infinite. Of course, by replacing X with a set A  ⊂  X and considering curves γ in A, we can talk about a function g being an upper gradient of u in A. We define the local Lipschitz constant of a locally Lipschitz function [formula] by

[formula]

Then [formula] is an upper gradient of u, see e.g. [\cite=Che]. Upper gradients were originally introduced in [\cite=HK].

If g is a nonnegative μ-measurable function on X and ([\ref=eq:definition_of_upper_gradient]) holds for 1-almost every curve, we say that g is a 1-weak upper gradient of u. A property holds for 1-almost every curve if it fails only for a curve family with zero 1-modulus. A family Γ of curves is of zero 1-modulus if there is a nonnegative Borel function ρ∈L1(X) such that for all curves γ∈Γ, the curve integral [formula] is infinite.

Given an open set Ω  ⊂  X, we consider the following norm

[formula]

with the infimum taken over all 1-weak upper gradients g of u in Ω. The substitute for the Sobolev space W1,1(Ω) in the metric setting is the Newton-Sobolev space

[formula]

It is known that for any [formula], there exists a minimal 1-weak upper gradient, denoted by gu, that satisfies gu  ≤  g μ-almost everywhere in Ω, for any 1-weak upper gradient [formula] of u in Ω, see [\cite=BB]. For more on Newton-Sobolev spaces, we refer to [\cite=S] [\cite=BB] [\cite=HKST].

Next we recall the definition and basic properties of functions of bounded variation on metric spaces, see [\cite=M]. See also e.g. [\cite=AFP] [\cite=EvaG92] [\cite=Giu84] [\cite=Zie89] for the classical theory in the Euclidean setting. For [formula], we define the total variation of u in X to be

[formula]

where each gui is an upper gradient of ui. We say that a function u∈L1(X) is of bounded variation, and denote [formula], if [formula]. By replacing X with an open set Ω  ⊂  X in the definition of the total variation, we can define [formula]. For an arbitrary set A  ⊂  X, we define

[formula]

If [formula], [formula] is a finite Radon measure on Ω by [\cite=M]. The [formula] norm is defined by

[formula]

A μ-measurable set E  ⊂  X is said to be of finite perimeter if [formula], where [formula] is the characteristic function of E. The perimeter of E in Ω is also denoted by

[formula]

Similarly as above, if P(E,Ω) <   ∞  , then P(E,  ·  ) is a finite Radon measure on Ω. For any Borel sets E1,E2  ⊂  X we have by [\cite=M]

[formula]

Similarly it can be shown that if Ω  ⊂  X is an open set and [formula], then

[formula]

We have the following coarea formula from [\cite=M]: if Ω  ⊂  X is an open set and [formula], then

[formula]

If ||Du||(Ω) <   ∞  , the above is true with Ω replaced by any Borel set A  ⊂  Ω.

We will assume throughout that X supports a (1,1)-Poincaré inequality, meaning that there exist constants CP  ≥  1 and λ  ≥  1 such that for every ball B(x,r), every [formula], and every upper gradient g of u, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

The 1-capacity of a set A  ⊂  X is given by

[formula]

where the infimum is taken over all functions u∈N1,1(X) such that u  ≥  1 in A. For basic properties satisfied by the 1-capacity, such as monotonicity and countable subadditivity, see e.g. [\cite=BB].

Given a set of finite perimeter E  ⊂  X, for H-almost every x∈∂*E we have

[formula]

where γ∈(0,1 / 2] only depends on the doubling constant and the constants in the Poincaré inequality, see [\cite=A1]. For an open set Ω  ⊂  X and a μ-measurable set E  ⊂  X with P(E,Ω) <   ∞  , we have for any Borel set A  ⊂  Ω

[formula]

where θE:X  →  [α,Cd] with α  =  α(Cd,CP,λ) > 0, see [\cite=A1] and [\cite=AMP].

The lower and upper approximate limits of a μ-measurable function u on X are defined respectively by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that we understand [formula] functions to be μ-equivalence classes. To consider continuity properties, we need to consider the pointwise representatives [formula] and [formula]. We also define the representative

[formula]

Preliminary measure theoretic results

In this section we discuss some measure theoretic results that will be needed in the proof of our main result.

First we note that the following coarea inequality holds.

If U  ⊂  X is an open set and [formula], then

[formula]

where [formula].

By [\cite=KoLa] (which is based on [\cite=BH]), the following coarea inequality holds: if ν is a positive Radon measure of finite mass and [formula] is bounded, then

[formula]

Choose [formula] and let ν: = μ|U', so that ν is of finite mass. Define a function u: = w in U', so that [formula], and extend it to a bounded function [formula]. Since H(A)  ≤  C3dμ+(A) for any A  ⊂  X (see e.g. [\cite=KoLa]), we have

[formula]

By letting [formula] and using Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem on both sides, we obtain the result with [formula].

Now we can show that the level sets of a locally Lipschitz function have the following weak regularity.

Let U  ⊂  X be an open set and let [formula]. Then [formula] for almost every [formula].

Fix [formula]. Note that [formula]. Let

[formula]

Note that in U, ∂*{w > s}  ⊂  ∂{w > s}  ⊂  {w = s}, which are pairwise disjoint sets for distinct values of s. Note also that for any open set V  ⊂  U', denoting the minimal 1-weak upper gradient of w in V by gw, we have

[formula]

where the first inequality follows from the fact that [formula] μ-almost everywhere, see [\cite=Che] or [\cite=HKST], and the second inequality follows from [\cite=HKLL].

By using the disjointness of the sets ∂*{u > s}  ⊂  ∂{u > s} in U, Lemma [\ref=lem:coarea_inequality], and [\eqref=eq:Lipschitz_constant_and_variation_measure], we estimate for any open set V with [formula]

[formula]

By taking the infimum of open sets V as above, we get [formula] on the right-hand side. By also using the [formula] coarea inequality [\eqref=eq:coarea] and [\eqref=eq:def_of_theta], we obtain

[formula]

since [formula] for all [formula]. By exhausting U by sets [formula], we obtain the result.

Since we are going to work with quasicontinuity-type results, in the following we prove a few results on how to analyse and manipulate sets of small capacity.

The 1-capacity and the Hausdorff contents are closely related: it follows from [\cite=HaKi] that [formula] if and only if H(A) = 0. For any R > 0 and A  ⊂  X, from the proof of [\cite=KKST3] it follows that

[formula]

and by combining [\cite=HaKi] and the proof of [\cite=HaKi] we obtain that conversely

[formula]

Finally, we note that [formula] is an outer capacity, meaning that

[formula]

for any A  ⊂  X, see e.g. [\cite=BB].

Let A  ⊂  X be a Borel set with H(A) <   ∞  , and let ε > 0. Then there exists an open set U  ⊃  A with [formula] such that

[formula]

uniformly for all [formula].

Inductively, we can pick compact sets [formula] with

[formula]

see e.g. [\cite=AFP]. Also pick open sets Ui  ⊃  Hi and a decreasing sequence of numbers [formula] with [formula] such that

[formula]

see Remark [\ref=rmk:capacities_and_Hausdorff_contents].

Then define for each [formula]

[formula]

Fix [formula]. From the definition of Gi we obtain a covering {B(x,r(x))}x∈Gi of Gi, and by the 5-covering theorem, we can extract a countable collection of disjoint balls [formula] such that the balls B(xk,5rk) cover Gi. Thus by Remark [\ref=rmk:capacities_and_Hausdorff_contents],

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

For [formula], if 0 < r < rj, then

[formula]

Finally, since

[formula]

we can choose an open set [formula] with [formula], and then we can take [formula].

Let G  ⊂  X and ε > 0. Then there exists an open set U  ⊃  G with [formula] such that

[formula]

uniformly for [formula].

We can assume that [formula]. By Remark [\ref=rmk:capacities_and_Hausdorff_contents], we have

[formula]

(Of course we may have [formula].) Thus we can pick a covering [formula] of G with [formula] for all [formula] and

[formula]

For any fixed [formula], consider the following three properties.

By [\cite=KKST] (or more precisely its proof) we have

[formula]

for every ρ∈[rk,2rk]; note that here we need the fact that [formula].

By applying the [formula] coarea formula [\eqref=eq:coarea] with [formula] and Ω = B(xk,2rk), we have P(B(xk,ρ),X) <   ∞   for almost every ρ∈[rk,2rk].

By applying the coarea inequality given in Lemma [\ref=lem:coarea_inequality] with [formula] and U = B(xk,2rk), we conclude that there exists T  ⊂  [rk,2rk] with L1(T)  ≥  rk / 2 such that

[formula]

for every ρ∈T.

Thus for each [formula] we can find a radius [formula] with

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from [\eqref=eq:def_of_theta]. Let [formula], so that by the above and [\eqref=eq:capacity_cover_of_G],

[formula]

Note that if for any given ball B(x,r) we have H(∂B(x,r)) <   ∞  , then for any y∈X we have [formula] for almost every s > 0. Thus we can pick the radii [formula] recursively in such a way that we also have [formula] whenever k  ≠  l.

Then take a set U  ⊃  A with

[formula]

as given by Lemma [\ref=lem:uniform_convergence]. We can assume that also [formula], since by Remark [\ref=rmk:capacities_and_Hausdorff_contents] and [\eqref=eq:capacity_cover_of_G],

[formula]

Let [formula]. If for r > 0 we have [formula], then since [formula], we have [formula]. Denoting [formula], we have

[formula]

uniformly as r  →  0 by Lemma [\ref=lem:uniform_convergence].

The following lemma can be proved by very similar methods as those used above.

For any G  ⊂  X, we can find an open set U  ⊃  G with [formula] and [formula].

The next lemma gives a standard fact about the relationship between Hausdorff content and measure.

Let A  ⊂  X and R > 0. If HR(A) = 0, then H(A) = 0.

Note that the converse implication is trivial. In [\cite=KKST3] it was shown that we have the above even for R =   ∞  , under the additional assumption that the space is 1-hyperbolic, but we do not need to consider this assumption in this paper.

We can assume that A is bounded, and so A  ⊂  B(x0,R0) for some x0∈X and R0  ≥  R. Fix ε > 0. By the fact that HR(A) = 0, we can find a covering [formula] of A such that rj  ≤  R for all [formula] and

[formula]

We can also assume that [formula] for all [formula], and so xj∈B(x0,2R0) for all [formula]. Note that we can choose Q > 1 in [\eqref=eq:homogenous_dimension]. Then for each [formula] we have

[formula]

so that

[formula]

so in fact we have

[formula]

Here δε  →  0 as ε  →  0. Thus H(A) =  lim ε  →  0Hδε(A) = 0.

The following lemma is well known e.g. in the Euclidean setting. We will only use it in the special case of sets of finite perimeter, but we give the standard proof for more general [formula] functions.

Let Ω  ⊂  X be an open set, let [formula] with ||Du||(Ω) <   ∞  , and let R > 0. Then for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if A  ⊂  Ω with HR(A) < δ, then ||Du||(A) < ε.

By the [formula] coarea formula [\eqref=eq:coarea], for almost every [formula] we have P({u > t},Ω) <   ∞  , and by [\eqref=eq:def_of_theta] we have

[formula]

for such t. Fix one such [formula]. Assume that there exists δ > 0 and a sequence of Borel sets Ai, [formula], such that HR(Ai)  ≤  2- i but [formula]. Then defining

[formula]

we have HR(A) = 0 but H(A)  ≥  δ, a contradiction by Lemma [\ref=lem:Hausdorff_content_and_measure]. Thus for almost every [formula], [formula] if HR(A)  →  0, for A Borel.

By the coarea formula [\eqref=eq:coarea],

[formula]

for any Borel set A  ⊂  Ω. Here we have by [\eqref=eq:def_of_theta] again that [formula] for almost every [formula]. By using Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem, with the majorant function t  ↦  P({u > t},Ω), we get ||Du||(A)  →  0 if HR(A)  →  0, with A Borel. The result for general sets A  ⊂  Ω follows by approximation.

Let Ω  ⊂  X be an open set and let [formula] with ||Du||(Ω) <   ∞  . Then for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if A  ⊂  Ω with [formula], then ||Du||(A) < ε.

Combine Remark [\ref=rmk:capacities_and_Hausdorff_contents] and Lemma [\ref=lem:variation_measure_and_Hausdorff_content].

Quasicontinuity

In this section we present and slightly generalize the quasicontinuity-type result for [formula] functions given in [\cite=LaSh].

In the Euclidean setting, results on the fine properties of [formula] functions can be formulated in terms of the lower and upper approximate limits [formula] and [formula] given in [\eqref=eq:lower_approximate_limit] and [\eqref=eq:upper_approximate_limit]. In the metric setting, we need to consider more than two jump values. Recall the definition of the number γ from [\eqref=eq:definition_of_gamma]. Then we define the functions ul, [formula], as follows: [formula], [formula], and for [formula] we define inductively

[formula]

provided [formula], and otherwise we set [formula]. It can be shown that each ul is a Borel function, and [formula].

We have the following notion of quasicontinuity for [formula] functions.

Let [formula] and let ε > 0. Then there exists an open set G  ⊂  X with [formula] such that if yk  →  x with [formula], then

[formula]

for each [formula].

First we give a local version of this result, as follows.

Let Ω  ⊂  X be an open set, let [formula], and let ε > 0. Then there exists an open set G  ⊂  Ω with [formula] such that if yk  →  x with [formula], then

[formula]

for each [formula].

Pick sets [formula] with [formula]. Also pick cutoff functions [formula] with 0  ≤  ηj  ≤  1 and ηj = 1 in Ωj for each [formula]. Denote the Lipschitz constants by Lj. Fix [formula]. We have [formula], so that we find a sequence [formula] in [formula] with

[formula]

Recall that gui denotes the minimal 1-weak upper gradient of ui. Clearly [formula] with ηjui  →  ηju in L1(X) as i  →    ∞  . Thus by the definition of the total variation and by the Leibniz rule for Newton-Sobolev functions, see [\cite=BB], we have

[formula]

Thus [formula] for each [formula], and so we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm:quasicontinuity] to obtain open sets Gj  ⊂  X with [formula]. Defining [formula], we have [formula], and if yk  →  x with [formula], then yk,x∈Ωj for some [formula] and thus for large enough [formula]

[formula]

as k  →    ∞   for each [formula], by the fact that yk,x∉Gj.

Recall the definitions of the measure theoretic interior and exterior IE and OE of a set E  ⊂  X from [\eqref=eq:definition_of_measure_theoretic_interior] and [\eqref=eq:definition_of_measure_theoretic_exterior]. Note that for [formula], we have x∈IE if and only if [formula], x∈OE if and only if [formula], and x∈∂*E if and only if [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, in this case [formula] and [formula].

In this paper we will only need the following notion of quasicontinuity for sets of finite perimeter, which is obtained by applying Corollary [\ref=cor:quasicontinuity_local_case] to [formula].

Let Ω  ⊂  X be an open set, let E  ⊂  X be a μ-measurable set with P(E,Ω) <   ∞  , and let ε > 0. Then there exists an open set G  ⊂  Ω with [formula] such that if yk  →  x with [formula], then

[formula]

and

[formula]

For example, if x∈OE, then [formula] and necessarily yk∈OE for sufficiently large [formula].

Approximation of sets of finite perimeter

In this section we prove our main result on the approximation of a set of finite perimeter by more regular sets in the [formula] norm.

We will need to work with Whitney-type coverings of open sets. For the construction of such coverings and their properties, see e.g. [\cite=BBS07]. Given any open set U  ⊂  X and a scale R > 0, we can choose a Whitney-type covering {Bj = B(xj,rj)}∞j = 1 of U such that

for each [formula],

[formula]

for each [formula], the ball 10λBk meets at most C = C(Cd,λ) balls 10λBj (that is, a bounded overlap property holds),

if 10λBj meets 10λBk, then rj  ≤  2rk.

Given such a covering of U, we can take a partition of unity {φj}∞j = 1 subordinate to the covering, such that 0  ≤  φj  ≤  1, each φj is a C / rj-Lipschitz function, and [formula] for each [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=BBS07]). Finally, we can define a discrete convolution v of any [formula] with respect to the Whitney-type covering by

[formula]

In general, v is locally Lipschitz in U, and hence belongs to [formula].

We can "mollify" [formula] functions in open sets in the following manner. Recall the definition of the pointwise representative [formula] from [\eqref=eq:precise_representative].

Let U  ⊂  Ω  ⊂  X be open sets, and let [formula] with ||Du||(Ω) <   ∞  . Then there exists a function [formula] with ||Dw||(Ω) <   ∞   such that w = u in [formula] and [formula] with an upper gradient g satisfying ||g||L1(U)  ≤  C||Du||(U).

The function w is defined in U as a limit of discrete convolutions of u with respect to Whitney-type coverings of open sets [formula] with [formula], at an arbitrary fixed scale R > 0. For H-almost every x∈∂U we have

[formula]

as r  →  0.

This is essentially [\cite=LaSh]. The last two sentences of the theorem are not part of [\cite=LaSh], but follow from its proof. Moreover, in [\cite=LaSh] we make the assumption [formula], but the proof runs through almost verbatim for the slightly more general case presented here.

Now we give our main result.

Let Ω  ⊂  X be an open set, let E  ⊂  X be a μ-measurable set with P(E,Ω) <   ∞  , and let ε > 0. Then there exists a μ-measurable set F  ⊂  X with

[formula]

Apply Corollary [\ref=cor:quasicontinuity_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter] to obtain a set G  ⊂  Ω with [formula], and then apply Lemma [\ref=lem:uniform_convergence_of_G] to obtain an open set U  ⊂  Ω with U  ⊃  G such that

[formula]

uniformly for [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:variation_measure_and_capacity] we can also assume that

[formula]

In the following, we "mollify" [formula] in the set U and then define F as a super-level set of the mollified function. First, apply Theorem [\ref=thm:mollifying_in_an_open_set] with [formula] and at the scale R = 1 to obtain a function [formula] with ||Dw||(Ω) <   ∞   and [formula].

Fix [formula] with x∈OE. By Corollary [\ref=cor:quasicontinuity_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter], there exists δ∈(0,1) such that B(x,δ)  ⊂  Ω and

[formula]

By making δ smaller, if necessary, by Lemma [\ref=lem:uniform_convergence_of_G] we also have

[formula]

for all [formula] and r∈(0,δ). Here ⌈a⌉ is the smallest integer at least [formula].

Fix [formula]. Recall that w is defined in U as a limit of discrete convolutions of u with respect to Whitney-type coverings [formula] of sets Ui  ⊂  U at scale R = 1. Since [formula], we can fix a sufficiently large [formula] such that

[formula]

Suppose that y∈B(xij,2rij). It is easy to see that B(xij,2rij)  ⊂  B(x,δ). Then

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Since B(x,δ)  ⊂  Ω, there is [formula] with [formula]. Then B(z,2d(y,z))  ⊂  200λBij, so by the doubling property of the measure

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

and thus d(x,z) < δ / 2. Hence B(z,2d(y,z))  ⊂  B(x,δ), so that

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq:using_quasicontinuity]. Using this and [\eqref=eq:using_uniform_convergence_for_G], we obtain

[formula]

For each [formula], let wi be the discrete convolution of u in Ui with respect to the Whitney-type covering [formula]. Recalling the definition of a discrete convolution from [\eqref=eq:definition_of_discrete_convolution], we have for suitable Lipschitz functions φij

[formula]

According to Theorem [\ref=thm:mollifying_in_an_open_set], the quantity [formula] is defined as the limit of wi(y) as i  →    ∞  , so we have [formula]. Since [formula] was arbitrary, we have [formula] in [formula]. Similarly, for any [formula] there exists some r > 0 such that [formula] in [formula].

By the [formula] coarea formula [\eqref=eq:coarea], we can find a set T  ⊂  (1 / 4,3 / 4) with L1(T)  ≥  1 / 4 such that for all t∈T,

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:mollifying_in_an_open_set]. By [\eqref=eq:boundary_trace_behavior_for_mollified_function], there exists N  ⊂  ∂U with H(N) = 0 such that for every [formula], we have

[formula]

as r  →  0. For any fixed t∈(0,1), this implies

[formula]

as r  →  0.

Again by the [formula] coarea formula [\eqref=eq:coarea], for almost every t∈(0,1), setting

[formula]

so that [formula] as μ-equivalence classes, we have P(Ft,Ω) <   ∞  . By [\eqref=eq:Lebesgue_property_at_boundary_of_U], for every [formula] and for all s  ≠  0, we have [formula]. Thus by the [formula] coarea formula [\eqref=eq:coarea] and [\eqref=eq:def_of_theta], for almost every t∈(0,1)

[formula]

By using this and [\eqref=eq:estimate_for_boundary_of_level_set], we have for almost every t∈T

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq:smallness_of_perimeter_in_U], and also

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=prop:null_difference_between_topological_and_meas_theor_bdry]. We fix one such t and define F: = Ft. Since

[formula]

we have [formula] and one claim of the theorem is proved.

From Corollary [\ref=cor:quasicontinuity_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter] we know that if [formula], then x∈∂*E. Thus from the definition of F it follows that

[formula]

If [formula], the previously proved fact that [formula] in [formula] for some r > 0 implies that

[formula]

for any t∈(1 / 4,3 / 4). Combining this with [\eqref=eq:using_quasicontinuity], we conclude that x is an exterior point of F. Analogously, if [formula], then x is an interior point of F. If [formula], then [formula] by [\eqref=eq:Lebesgue_property_at_boundary_of_U]. In total,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

by [\eqref=eq:null_difference_between_topological_and_meas_theor_bdry].

A standard example illustrating how badly behaved a set of finite perimeter can be is given by the so-called enlarged rationals. Consider the Euclidean space [formula] equipped with the Lebesgue measure L2. Let [formula] be an enumeration of [formula], and define

[formula]

Clearly L2(E)  ≤  π. By the lower semicontinuity and subadditivity of perimeter, see [\eqref=eq:Caccioppoli_sets_form_an_algebra], we can estimate

[formula]

so that [formula], and then also H(∂*E) <   ∞  . On the other hand, [formula], so that L2(∂E) =   ∞   and in particular H1(∂E) =   ∞    =  H(∂E) (where H1 is the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which is comparable to the codimension 1 Hausdorff measure H). However, we can define the set [formula] of Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter] as

[formula]

for [formula] sufficiently large. It can then be shown that [formula] as N  →    ∞  , and that [formula]. By slightly modifying the set F near the intersections of the spheres ∂B(qi,2- i), if necessary, we can even ensure that ∂F = ∂*F.

If the answer is yes, note that [formula], and thus in Ω, [formula] is a lower semicontinuous function. Similarly, in Ω, [formula] is then an upper semicontinuous function.

Note also that it follows from the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:approximation_for_sets_of_finite_perimeter] that [formula] and [formula] can differ only in the set [formula], where N is the H-negligible set defined before [\eqref=eq:Lebesgue_property_at_boundary_of_U]. Thus we have

[formula]

For a more general [formula] function, we can now ask the following.
