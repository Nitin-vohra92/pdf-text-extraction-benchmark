Controlling and observing nonseparability of phonons created in time-dependent 1D atomic Bose condensates

Introduction

One of the main predictions of quantum field theory concerns the possibility of producing pairs of particles by exciting vacuum fluctuations. This requires coupling the quantum field to a strong external classical field. The simplest example consists in working with a homogeneous but time-dependent background. In this case, by solving the linear equation of motion of the quantum field, one easily verifies that the temporal variations of the background induce a parametric amplification of vacuum fluctuations which results in the production of pairs of particles with opposite momenta, such as occurs in an expanding universe [\cite=Parker-1968] [\cite=Birrell-Davies] [\cite=Fulling]. A similar phenomenon takes place in static external fields which have sufficiently strong spatial gradients, such as the production of pairs of charged particles in a constant electric field [\cite=Schwinger-1951] [\cite=Greiner] or the Hawking effect in the vicinity of a black hole horizon [\cite=Hawking-1975]. (See [\cite=Primer] for the relationship of these latter phenomena to each other, as well as to pair production by an accelerating mirror.)

However, it turns out that the experimental validation of these predictions is very difficult, and so far we are not aware of any direct detection using elementary particles. To circumvent the difficulties related to the high energies at play in particle physics, it has been proposed to use quasi-particles describing collective excitations of some medium [\cite=Unruh-1981] [\cite=AnalogueGravity-LivingReview]. In fact, recently there have been several experiments aimed at observing the pair creation of quasi-particles propagating in a background with either temporal [\cite=Wilson-et-al-2011] [\cite=Jaskula-et-al] [\cite=Lahteenmaki-et-al] or strong spatial gradients [\cite=Lahav-et-al-2010] [\cite=Nguyen-et-al] [\cite=Steinhauer-2016].

Two aspects of such experiments deserve close attention. The first concerns the dynamical response of the medium. Indeed, when dealing with quasi-particles, one controls only indirectly the temporal (or spatial) dependence of the macroscopic system which acts as a background field. For instance, when considering the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in an atomic Bose gas [\cite=Fedichev-Fischer] [\cite=Carusotto-DCE] (the main focus of the present work), the condensed portion of the gas acts as the background, whereas one has direct control only over the external potential. Modifying this potential induces a response in the condensate, the dynamics of which are governed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and may lead to nontrivial evolutions.

The second issue concerns the origin of the detected particles. For, if the scattering of vacuum fluctuations gives rise to pairs of correlated outgoing quanta, so does the scattering of a nonzero incident distribution (such as a thermal bath). Hence, in practice, both processes produce correlated pairs. But we wish to be able to show that a part of the signal must have originated in vacuum fluctuations, as this is the component with no classical counterpart. This requires measurements able to distinguish between the spontaneous (sourced by vacuum) and stimulated (sourced by an incident incoherent distribution) channels [\cite=Werner] [\cite=Simon] [\cite=Horodecki-Review]. In this paper, two observables shall be used: when working in situ, we shall use the two-point function of density fluctuations in the atomic gas, whereas the two-body distribution of the atoms' momenta will be used when considering time-of-flight (TOF) experiments after having opened the trap [\cite=Pitaevskii-Stringari-BEC]. We shall determine under which conditions precise measurements of each of these observables is sufficient to assess the nonseparability of the phonon state after DCE. In particular, we shall show that instantaneous measurements involving only commuting variables can be sufficient.

In this work we consider density perturbations in a cigar-shaped ultracold atomic Bose gas. That is, we focus on elongated clouds with transverse dimensions much smaller than their longitudinal extensions. More precisely, we work in the 1D mean field regime [\cite=Menotti-Stringari] [\cite=Tozzo-Dalfovo] [\cite=Gerbier] where the transverse excitations can be neglected. In Section [\ref=sec:Condensate] we study the dynamical response of such an elongated cloud when modifying the harmonic trap frequency [formula], which fixes its transverse extension [\cite=Kagan-Surkov-Shlyapnikov]. In Section [\ref=sec:Phonons] we study the longitudinal excitations (phonons) excited by the resulting time dependence of the atomic cloud, including what it means for pairs of phonon modes to be in a nonseparable state. Section [\ref=sec:InSitu] deals with the determination of the phonon state via in situ measurements, whereas in Section [\ref=sec:TOF] we examine the measurements of atoms after TOF and how these can be used to infer the phonon state before the expansion of the cloud. Our main results are summarized in Section [\ref=sec:Conclusion], along with their implications for future experiments. In Appendix [\ref=app:num_sol_GPE] we compare our analytical approximations with the results of numerical resolutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, while in Appendix [\ref=app:Thermal], we present some results when the initial phonon state is a thermal bath.

Dynamical response of elongated condensates

In this Section, we examine the properties of a cylindrical condensate and its response to a varying harmonic potential [\cite=Kagan-Surkov-Shlyapnikov]. Since, the condensate plays the role of the background field in the pair production of phonons, this is a necessary first step to know what variations of the background are experimentally accessible.

Gaussian approximation and stationary configuration

To characterize the background solutions we use the Bogoliubov approximation and write the field operator for a Bose condensed atomic gas in the form

[formula]

where Φ0 is a c-number and [formula] describes relative linear perturbations. The mean field Φ0 obeys (in units where 1):

[formula]

where m is the atomic mass, V is an external potential and g is the two-atom coupling constant, related to the s-wave scattering length as via g  =  4πas / m (see, e.g., [\cite=Dalfovo-et-al-1999] [\cite=Pitaevskii-Stringari-BEC]). The external potential is taken to be harmonic, and in the case of cylindrical symmetry it can be decomposed into a radial and a longitudinal part:

[formula]

The ratio [formula] determines the shape of the condensate: when [formula], the condensate is very elongated in the longitudinal direction z, becoming cigar-shaped. For simplicity, we shall assume [formula], so that the ground state of the condensate is homogeneous in z. If we further assume that the condensate is stationary and cylindrically symmetric, then Φ0 becomes a function of only the radial coordinate r. Even in this case, the exact solutions of Eq. ([\ref=eq:GPE]) are complicated by the nonlinear term, see Appendix [\ref=app:num_sol_GPE] for details.

Here we adopt the procedure of [\cite=Gerbier]: we assume that the atomic number density takes the Gaussian form

[formula]

where n1 is the linear atom density and σ the width of the condensate. This ansatz becomes exact when g = 0. We thus expect it to be a good approximation when n1as is small enough. In a stationary configuration, the left hand side of Eq. ([\ref=eq:GPE]) is simply μ  Φ0, where μ is the energy per atom, equal to the chemical potential at zero temperature. Multiplying Eq. ([\ref=eq:GPE]) by [formula] and integrating over r, we find that μ is equal to the effective potential

[formula]

An approximation of the ground state of the condensate for a given linear density n1 is obtained by minimizing Veff with respect to σ, yielding the optimal width σ0 [\cite=Gerbier]: where [formula] is the harmonic oscillator length. Although these expressions have been derived in the Gaussian approximation of Eq. ([\ref=eq:gaussian_ansatz]), the comparison with numerical results of the full Gross-Pitaevskii equation ([\ref=eq:GPE]) in Appendix [\ref=app:num_sol_GPE] indicates that they are quite robust (in agreement with [\cite=Gerbier]).

In the Gaussian approximation, [formula] is a function of only n1as. By contrast, the relationship between the density n1 and the (effective 1-dimensional) healing length ξ also depends on the ratio [formula]:

[formula]

This extra dependence stems from the fact that ξ refers to the dynamics of phonons, which shall be studied in the next Section. In Fig. [\ref=fig:chemical_potential] we represent the chemical potential μ as a function of n1as, as given by the second of Eqs. ([\ref=eq:cond_ground_state]). On the upper horizontal axis is shown n1ξ of Eq. ([\ref=eq:1Dxi]), with [formula] as is approximately the case in the experiment of [\cite=Steinhauer-2016] and is of the right order of magnitude for the experiments of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al]. The validity of the 1D mean field regime requires [formula] and n1ξ  ≫  1. In Fig. [\ref=fig:chemical_potential] these limits are indicated by the dotted vertical lines. We also indicate the values of n1as for Refs. [\cite=Steinhauer-2016] [\cite=Jaskula-et-al].

Time-dependent response

Let us now suppose that the trapping frequency [formula] varies in time. Using again the Gaussian approximation of Eq. ([\ref=eq:gaussian_ansatz]) with σ time dependent, one obtains the equation of motion

[formula]

see Appendix [\ref=app:num_sol_GPE] for the derivation. The condensate width σ thus behaves like the position of a classical point particle of mass m in the potential Veff. Remarkably, although this equation has been derived in the context of the Gaussian approximation, it is an exact consequence of equation ([\ref=eq:GPE]) in a harmonic radial potential, as found in [\cite=Kagan-Surkov-Shlyapnikov]. This is due to the existence of an exact scale invariance described by σ(t), the time-dependent radial density profile being given by

[formula]

where ρ0(r / σ0) is a solution of the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation and σ satisfies Eq. [\ref=eq:sigma_eom2].

To study the evolution of σ(t), is convenient to express [formula], where [formula] is some reference value (commonly its initial value). Eq. ([\ref=eq:sigma_eom]) then gives

[formula]

where σ0 is the equilibrium value corresponding to [formula], see Eq. ([\ref=eq:cond_ground_state]). This suggests that we use the adimensionalized time variable [formula] and width σ(t) / σ0. When λ is constant, Eq. ([\ref=eq:sigma_eom2]) can be further simplified by noting that σ2 exactly obeys a harmonic equation: noting that Eq. ([\ref=eq:sigma_eom]) implies conservation of [formula], it can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

so that σ2 oscillates with frequency [formula]. This implies that, while the oscillations of σ are not exactly sinusoidal, its oscillation frequency is always [formula]. (The latter result is intuitive: a single particle in the same potential would oscillate around r = 0 at frequency [formula], while the condensate wave function recovers its initial form when all atoms are in the radially opposite position, and thus oscillates at twice this frequency.)

Let us use Eq. [\ref=eq:sigma_eom2] to determine (numerically) how the condensate responds to a temporal change in [formula]. For concreteness, we assume that [formula] varies according to a hyperbolic tangent in time:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the initial and final values of [formula], respectively. Here we work with [formula] so that λ(t)  →  1 for t  →    -    ∞  . In the left panel of Figure [\ref=fig:tanh_response] are shown examples in which [formula] is fixed at 2, as in the first experiment of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al]. The three variations of [formula] differ only in the rate a, which describes the rapidity of the change. The plot itself shows the corresponding time dependence of the central density ρ(t,r  =  0). As can be seen, the rate a is crucial in determining the final state of the condensate. For, when [formula] is small enough (i.e., [formula]), the change is adiabatic: the condensate remains in its ground state throughout the change, with its final width and chemical potential simply corresponding to Eqs. ([\ref=eq:cond_ground_state]) with the new values of [formula] and [formula]. However, as [formula] is increased, the condensate cannot keep up with the change in [formula] and ends up with an energy which is larger than the final ground state energy. Its central density thus oscillates around the value of the final ground state. As could have been expected, the amplitude of these oscillations increases with [formula], saturating at a value corresponding to a sudden change, where one extreme of the oscillations in σ is equal to its initial value.

In the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_response], we plot the relative amplitude in the final oscillations of σ2 as a function of the inverse rate [formula] for various overall changes [formula]. σ2 is used because, as implied by Eq. ([\ref=eq:sigmasq_eom]), when [formula] is constant σ2 undergoes oscillations that are exactly sinusoidal. This illustrates the validity domains of two regimes discussed in [\cite=Kagan-Surkov-Shlyapnikov]: the sudden limit where the relative amplitude δσ2  /  〈σ2f〉 becomes independent of a for [formula]; and the adiabatic regime where this relative amplitude is proportional to [formula] in the limit [formula].

Opening the trap adiabatically

Let us end this section by considering the case where the final value of [formula] is zero. This corresponds to the opening of the trap, as performed in TOF measurements. We can immediately appreciate the qualitative difference of this case by considering the effective potential ([\ref=eq:Veff]), which for t  →    ∞   ends up with only the 1 / σ2 repulsive term. The condensate thus no longer oscillates, but expands indefinitely, and at large enough σ when the repulsive interaction between the atoms becomes negligible, they will simply expand freely and σ will increase linearly in time as if it were the position of a free particle.

To make contact with the former analysis, we continue to assume a hyperbolic tangent profile of the form ([\ref=eq:omega_perp_tanh]), though the vanishing of [formula] means that [formula] is now the only independent parameter. From Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_Tozzo_response] it is clear that [formula] significantly affects the rate of expansion of the condensate. In particular, a sudden opening of the trap (which is the standard case, see e.g. [\cite=Tozzo-Dalfovo]) results in the most rapid expansion. Importantly, it is possible to make the expansion arbitrarily slow by lowering a. As we shall see in Section [\ref=sec:TOF], in certain cases the control of the adiabaticity of the expansion is a necessity if one wishes to be able to assess the nonseparability of the phonon state that existed before opening the trap. Let us briefly explain why.

Although the condensate response shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_Tozzo_response] is independent of the value of n1as when using the adimensional units ρ(t) / ρi and [formula], the phonon response depends strongly on n1as in the same units. This is because, while [formula] is the natural frequency describing the response of the condensate to a sudden change, the natural frequency for describing the phonon response is mc2, where c is the low-frequency speed of longitudinal phonons (as we shall see in Section [\ref=sec:Phonons]). Since the one-dimensional healing length [formula], Eq. ([\ref=eq:1Dxi]) implies that the two time scales are related by

[formula]

The larger is this factor, the faster the condensate expansion will appear from the phonon point of view, and (as we shall see in Section [\ref=sec:TOF]) this rapid expansion can have a significant effect on the phonon state, including its degree of nonseparability. Importantly, in the 1D regime [formula] in which we work, this factor can be large. As a result, when considering phonon excitations for a given value of kξ, a sudden opening of effectively 1D condensates leads to larger non-adiabatic effects than for thick ones in the 3D regime with n1as  >  1. It is thus imperative to reduce the expansion rate through a controlled slow opening of the trap, so that the expansion is adiabatic from the phonon point of view and the phonon state can be preserved. (Again, we shall study these issues more fully in Section [\ref=sec:TOF].) We finally notice that the ratio [formula] plays here no role (at least within the Gaussian approximation).

Pair creation of phonons and their nonseparability

In this Section, we recall two fundamental aspects of linear perturbations (phonons) propagating on top of the condensate: the response of phonons to a time-varying background (as provided by the condensate), and what it means for phonon pairs to be in a nonseparable state. Although it contains no original results, this Section provides key notions and equations needed for the subsequent Sections.

Equations of motion

Let us return to the Bogoliubov approximation of Eq. ([\ref=eq:Bog_approx]), for z-independent but time-dependent mean fields Φ0. To simplify the analysis, we assume that the relative perturbation [formula] is uniform in the transverse directions, i.e. that the absolute perturbation δ(t,r,z)  =  Φ0(t,r)  (t,z) has the same transverse profile as Φ0. The validity of this ansatz is discussed in Appendix [\ref=app:num_sol_GPE]. Using this factorization, [formula] obeys the 1-dimensional Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation:

[formula]

where n1 is the linear atom density in the longitudinal direction, and [formula] is the effective one-dimensional two-atom coupling constant (σ being the cylindrical width of the condensate in the Gaussian approximation, see Eq. ([\ref=eq:gaussian_ansatz])). Note that, while the linear density n1 is a constant, g1 varies as the inverse square of the condensate width, and is thus time-dependent.

The homogeneity of the background entails the decomposition of the system into two-mode sectors (k, - k) of opposite wave vectors. It is thus useful to perform the spatial Fourier transform: for a gas of extension L in the z direction, we define k such that

[formula]

where N is the total number of atoms in the gas and serves here to normalize the plane wave eigenfunctions in such a way that the equal time commutator is

[formula]

Then the operator k ([formula]) destroys (creates) an atom carrying momentum k.

To get the time dependence of these operators, we plug [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=eq:BdGeqn]) and obtain

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. To identify the consequences of the time dependence of g1(t), it is appropriate to perform the Bogoliubov transformation:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Irrespective of the time dependence of c2(t)  =  g1(t)n1 / m, one verifies that at all times u2k(t) - v2k(t) = 1 as required by the Bose commutation relations. Then Eq. ([\ref=eq:phi-k_eqn]) becomes

[formula]

Whenever the system is stationary, the operators k and [formula] decouple, and oscillate at constant frequencies ±  ωk: The operators k and [formula] are, respectively, annihilation and creation operators for collective excitations (phonons) of momentum k relative to the condensate. Note that, in the limit of small k, ωk  ≈  ck, i.e. c is just the speed of low-momentum phonons. Moreover, recalling that the (one-dimensional) healing length is [formula], Eq. ([\ref=eq:om_defn]) can be written in dimensionless form:

[formula]

Here we see the origin of our claim at the end of Section [\ref=sec:Condensate] that, from the phonon point of view, the natural frequency is mc2.

When c2 varies, the system ([\ref=eq:varphi_eom]) becomes nontrivial and encodes a mode mixing between the phonon modes of momenta k and - k, which entails amplification. To characterize this mode mixing, it is convenient to introduce the coefficients αk(t) and βk(t) [\cite=Busch-Parentani-Robertson]:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are defined such that, as t  →    -    ∞  , or equivalently, αk  →  1 and βk  →  0 as t  →    -    ∞  . Then the evolution of the operators [formula] is completely determined by the equations of motion for αk and βk, which are

[formula]

Once we know how c varies with time, we can use Eqs. ([\ref=eq:om_defn]) and ([\ref=eq:alpha_beta_eom]) to get the resulting dependence of αk and βk - and hence of k and [formula] - in time.

If we assume that c2 reaches another constant at late time, the initial and final mode operators are related by the U(1,1) linear transformation

[formula]

Because of this transformation, the 1-mode systems k and - k become correlated. In fact, given the right conditions, it is possible that the 2-mode state (k, - k) becomes nonseparable. Here, it is appropriate to recall this notion, for we shall find in later sections that it can be inferred from suitable measurements.

Nonseparability of bipartite systems

Roughly speaking, a multipartite quantum state is said to be nonseparable whenever the correlations between its constituent parts are too strong to be described by classical statistics (for more details, see [\cite=Werner] [\cite=Simon]). Restricting our attention to a two-mode state (e.g., particles of opposite momentum produced by DCE), each single-mode subsystem has its corresponding quantum amplitude operators j and [formula] (j = k, - k), satisfying the standard bosonic commutation relations [formula]. The density matrix k, - k of a two-mode system is said to be separable when it can be written as [\cite=Simon]

[formula]

where aj are the density matrices of the single-mode subsystems, and where the Pa are real numbers such that 0  ≤  Pa  ≤  1. Then [formula], and the Pa have the properties of a probability distribution. Such states can be considered as classically correlated in that they can be obtained by putting separately the subsystems k and - k in the (quantum) states described by ak and a- k, where the state a is determined using a random number generator distributed according to the probability distribution Pa. Conversely, nonseparable states possess correlations which cannot be accounted for by classical means. In fact, the nonseparability of the state is a necessary condition for obtaining a violation of Bell inequalities [\cite=Werner] [\cite=Campo-Parentani-2006] based on operators acting separately on the subsystems k and - k.

Assuming that the expectation value of j vanishes (or else redefining them as fluctuations j  -  〈j〉, see also footnote [\ref=fn:connected]), at quadratic order in these operators the only non-vanishing expectation values are The first gives the mean occupation number of quanta in a single mode, which in our case means the number of quasi-particles of type j. The second determines the correlations between the two modes, and is generally a complex number. Importantly, these two c-numbers contain enough information for assessing the nonseparability of k, - k. Indeed, the condition

[formula]

is sufficient for the state k, - k to be nonseparable [\cite=Campo-Parentani-2005] [\cite=Adamek-Busch-Parentani] [\cite=deNova-Sols-Zapata]. In addition, when the state k, - k is Gaussian, condition ([\ref=eq:nonsep]) is also necessary for nonseparability. To appreciate the fact that nonseparable states are very peculiar, and therefore difficult to realize and to identify, one should also recall that [formula] is bounded from above. As a result, nonseparable states live in a relatively small domain where one has

[formula]

In the limit of large occupation numbers, n  ≫  1, one sees that [formula] can be larger than 1 only by a term in 1 / n. Furthermore, if it is known due to reasons of symmetry that nk  =  n- k, then it is convenient to introduce the parameter [formula], for which condition ([\ref=eq:nonsep2]) is equivalent to

[formula]

The knowledge of Δk seems to involve the measurement of non-commuting operators, for neither of the number operators commutes with the correlation operator, and even the hermitian and antihermitian parts of the correlation operator   =  k- k do not commute. However, while measuring the two c-numbers of Eqs. ([\ref=eq:n_c_defn]) requires the performance of non-commuting measurements, we shall see that the nonseparability condition ([\ref=eq:nonsep]) can be determined via measurements in which non-commutativity plays no role.

In situ measurements of the phonon state

In this Section we consider measurements made directly on the Bose gas while it is still in the trap. The key observable is the instantaneous atom density, particularly fluctuations about its mean. We shall see how density correlations are related to the phonon state, and how they are affected by phonon pair creation due to temporal variations of the condensate.

Analyzing the density-density correlation function

Generalities

As an operator, the total (1-dimensional) number density of atoms in the gas is given by

[formula]

To obtain the second line we have used the decomposition ([\ref=eq:Bog_approx]) and the r-independence of [formula], and neglected the nonlinear contribution from the fluctuations. Using the constancy of the background density n1 in homogeneous systems , the relative density fluctuation is

[formula]

Since n̂1(t,z) commutes with [formula] for all [formula], within the framework of quantum mechanics it is possible to precisely measure n̂1(t,z) for all z at any given time. This can be done by taking an in situ image of the Bose gas (as in [\cite=Schley-et-al]). For each image, this serves as a single measurement of n̂1(t,z). Such a measurement is destructive, but on performing the experiment many times and collecting an ensemble of measurements of n̂1(t,z), one has access to both the expectation value [formula] and the variance of δn̂1(t,z).

We define the Fourier transform of [formula] by inverting Eq. [\eqref=eq:inv_Fourier], so that:

[formula]

for [formula]. The quantities δn̂1,k and k are defined similarly, with [formula] replaced by n̂1 and [formula]. From Eqs. ([\ref=eq:drho]) and ([\ref=eq:varphi_phi]), we obtain

[formula]

Note that taking the hermitian conjugate of this operator is equivalent to changing the sign of k, a result of the fact that the relative density fluctuation of Eq. ([\ref=eq:drho]) is itself a hermitian operator and measurements of it are thus real quantities. It is straightforward to show that this operator commutes with its hermitian conjugate, and the following correlation function is thus well-defined:

[formula]

where in the last line we have substituted the expressions in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:varphi_t-dep]), along with the definitions of nk and ck in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:n_c_defn]) and the fact that isotropy  implies nk  =  n- k. The last expression, stricto sensu, applies only when the background has reached a stationary state, so that phonon excitations can be analyzed in terms of stationary modes e±  iωkt. (A generalized version of this equation shall be studied in the next subsection). The mean occupation number nk determines the time-averaged mean of G2,k(t), while the magnitude and phase of the correlation ck respectively determine the amplitude and phase of the oscillations of G2,k(t) around its mean value. Note also the additional constant term '+ 1'. We shall see below that this term is a measurable quantity which encodes the vacuum fluctuations of the phonon field.

For homogeneous systems with a stationary background, one is thus able, irrespective of the complexity of the actual state k, - k, to extract both nk and ck from G2,k(t) of Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_n_c]) through repeated measurements at a series of different times. Since G2,k(t) encodes three real numbers, at least three such times are necessary to be able to extract nk and ck. Three times may be sufficient if the measurements are accurate and the times well-chosen (e.g. they are not separated by an integral number of oscillation periods). It should also be pointed out that measurements of G2,k which allow the extraction of nk and ck do not commute with each other, in conformity with the above mentioned fact that k- k does not commute with [formula]. Indeed, such measurements must be performed at different times, and for a stationary background it is straightforward to show that

[formula]

Measuring thermal and vacuum fluctuations

To illustrate these concepts, let us consider the simplest example: a stationary system in a thermal state, with temperature T. This is characterized by no correlations (ck  =  0) and by the expectation number

[formula]

Then we have simply

[formula]

Substituting the expressions ([\ref=eq:u-v_defn]) and ([\ref=eq:om_defn]) and rearranging slightly, this is

[formula]

This is a one-parameter family of functions of the adimensionalized momentum kξ  =  k / mc, where the parameter is the adimensionalized temperature T / mc2. Note that n1as is included in the definitions of ξ and c2, so that - to the extent that the Gaussian approximation is valid - G2,k is independent of the thickness of the condensate when expressed in terms of kξ and T / mc2. Examples of this function for various temperatures are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:InSitu_NoDCE].

It is of interest to take the low- and high-momentum limits of Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_hom_stat2]). For ωk / T  ≪  1, we have [formula], so that Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_hom_stat2]) becomes

[formula]

In particular, in the limit k  →  0, G2,k simply approaches the adimensionalized temperature T / mc2. We can thus determine the temperature of the gas by examining the low-momentum density fluctuations. k  =  0 is a local extremum whose nature is determined by the sign of the coefficient of the k2 term.

On the other hand, for ωk / T  ≫  1, we have [formula], so that Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_hom_stat2]) becomes

[formula]

In this zero temperature limit, G2,k characterizes the mean amplitude of vacuum fluctuations. Note that this measurable quantity originates in the constant term in the last line of Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_n_c]), and thus owes its existence to the non-commutativity of the quantum amplitudes k and [formula]. Note also that in the double limit T  →  0, k  →  0, G2,k goes to T / mc2  =  0 at k = 0 while the derivative ∂kG2,k remains finite.

Assessing nonseparability

To conclude this study, using measurements of G2,k(t), we are also able to assess whether or not the state (k, - k) is nonseparable using condition ([\ref=Delt]). Moreover, it is not necessary to extract both nk and ck in order to assess nonseparability; from Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_n_c]), it is clear that it is sufficient to find that, for some value of t, G2,k(t) satisfies the inequality

[formula]

This is one of our key observations: whatever the state k, - k, nonseparability can be ascertained by examining the behavior of a well-defined observable quantity, without any need to perform measurements of non-commuting variables. (Preliminary versions of this assertion were used in [\cite=Busch-Parentani-2013] [\cite=Busch-Parentani-Robertson] [\cite=Busch-Carusotto-Parentani] but without emphasis on the absence of measurements of non-commuting variables.)

To conclude this discussion, it is perhaps interesting to consider the inequality ([\ref=nonseptr]) from a slightly different point of view. One might ask in abstract terms why repeated measurements of δn̂1,k(t) of Eq. ([\ref=dnk]) are sufficient to assess nonseparability. The reason is that measuring the density fluctuation [formula] amounts in effect to using an interferometer, in that what is recorded in these measurements is a superposition of two channels (here the destruction of a phonon of momentum k, and the creation of a phonon of momentum - k). When changing t it amounts to varying the relative phase between them. Then, if t is such that ([\ref=nonseptr]) is satisfied, the interferences are so destructive that they reveal the existence of the nonseparability of the state. The analogy with the measurements of Ref. [\cite=Lopes-et-al] is striking.

DCE due to a one-time change in c2

Now suppose, having started in the incoherent thermal state just described, that there is a change in the system such that c2 varies from one constant value to another, and that this final value of c2 is constant for t  →    ∞  . According to Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_response], such a variation of c2 will occur iff the rate of change is small compared with [formula] throughout the evolution. This is quite feasible in the 1D regime, where [formula] is typically large; there thus exist variations which are slow from the point of view of the condensate, but fast from the point of view of the phonons.

The phonon state is probed by the operators ±  k(t), whose equation of motion is Eq. ([\ref=eq:varphi_eom]). This leads to nontrivial values of the Bogoliubov coefficients αk(t) and βk(t), and the correlation function of the first line of Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_n_c]) becomes

[formula]

To parameterize the adiabatic evolution of the background, we consider a hyperbolic tangent dependence of c2:

[formula]

Note that we normalize c2 with respect to its final value. Extending this to all quantities has the advantage that the final profile [formula] becomes a universal function of kξf (where ξf is the final value of the healing length), allowing a straightforward assessment of the nonseparability of the final state. In Figure [\ref=fig:InSitu_G2t_Tanh] are shown some examples of the variation of G2,k(t) in time at fixed k, and with k at fixed time. When considering the variation in time, we note the similarity with the response of the condensate density in Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_response]:

when a / ωk  ≪  1, the phonons of wave vector k are not excited above their initial occupation number;

when [formula], correlated excitations are produced in this 2-mode sector.

Indeed, comparing Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2_alpha_beta]) to Eq. ([\ref=eq:G2k_n_c]), we can write the final values of nk and ck in terms of αk and βk (see also [\cite=Busch-Parentani-Robertson]): The adiabatic variation (from the point of view of the phonons) corresponds to the case where αk and βk remain 1 and 0, respectively, throughout the evolution; thus the phonon content remains as it was before the change, and G2,k varies in time only because (uk + vk)2 does so. A non-zero βk encodes the level of non-adiabaticity, inducing correlated phonons in the condensate; furthermore, this phonon production is enhanced by the presence of phonons to start with, since both quantities in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:n_and_c]) are proportional to 2nink  +  1. As these correlated phonons pass through each other and go in and out of phase, their contribution to the density profile varies, producing the oscillations seen in both panels of Fig. [\ref=fig:InSitu_G2t_Tanh].

In the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:InSitu_G2t_Tanh], one clearly sees that the lower envelopes of G2,k are below [formula] for a certain range of k which depends on the initial temperature. When this is the case, condition ([\ref=nonseptr]) implies that the phonon bipartite states are nonseparable. In Figure [\ref=fig:InSitu_Tanh_nonsep] we look more directly at this nonseparability. To this end, in the left panel we show again the minimum value reached by G2,k. It is clear from this plot that a higher rate of change of c2 tends to increase the degree of nonseparability, while a higher initial temperature tends to reduce it. On the right panel is shown the corresponding behavior of [formula].

DCE due to a modulation of c2

Having considered a transient evolution where the final value of c2 is steady for t  →    ∞  , as in the adiabatic variation of the condensate, let us now turn our attention to the outcome of a non-adiabatic variation of the condensate - in particular, a situation in which c2 oscillates in time, like the final state of the purple and yellow curves in Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_response]. This case is very similar to the one studied in [\cite=Busch-Parentani-Robertson]; here, we simply review the main results and apply them to the first experiment described in [\cite=Jaskula-et-al].

An oscillation of c2 leads to an oscillation of ωk for any given k. The frequency of that oscillation is the same for all k, and sets up a resonance in that mode whose time-averaged frequency k is equal to half the oscillation frequency. The particle content of the resonant mode grows exponentially in time. Furthermore, the resonance has a finite width in k-space that depends on the relative amplitude, δωk  /  k, of the frequency oscillations (which, for dispersive systems as here, will depend both on the relative amplitude of the oscillations in c2 and on the wave vector k). More precisely, we have

[formula]

where vp / vg gives the ratio of the phase and group velocities. The subscript 'res' indicates the width of the resonance in Fourier space, and the subscript 'time' indicates the width of the variation of ωk in time. Frequencies lying outside this narrow range are also excited, but their particle content oscillates in time, with those further from the resonance oscillating faster. An important point to note is that, since the modulation of c2 is caused by the natural oscillation of the condensate, the oscillation frequency is simply twice the final value of [formula]. As a result, the resonant phonon mode is then simply that for which [formula]. The amplitude of the oscillation will depend on how quickly [formula] is varied, as we have already seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_response].

As an example, in Figure [\ref=fig:InSitu_exp] are shown the evolutions of various in situ observables for the resonant mode, for a sudden change in which [formula] (corresponding to the first experiment of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al]). On the left is shown G2,k(t), along with its upper and lower envelopes and the nonseparability threshold [formula]. Note that the latter quantity is smeared because of the fact that [formula] oscillates in time in response to the oscillations in c2. On the right are shown [formula] and, for zero temperature, Δk(t) of Eq. ([\ref=Delt]). It is quite clear that the amplitude of the oscillations in G2,k(t) increase exponentially in time, as expected for a resonant mode, while the minimum of G2,k(t) saturates at zero (since G2,k(t)  ≥  0). These two observations lead to a third: while the degree of nonseparability increases in time in the sense that Δk becomes more negative, the visibility of the nonseparability in G2,k(t) actually decreases as nk becomes large, for the fraction of an oscillation for which [formula] becomes smaller and smaller. For the sake of obtaining a visibly nonseparable state, then, it is best to stop the growth when [formula]. Using the values of the experiment of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al], this means that the optimal number of oscillations should satisfy [formula].

In the actual experiment of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al], however, the trapping frequency is held at its final value for an equivalent of around 60 oscillations of the condensate, after which the trap is opened and the condensate is allowed to expand freely. The measured distribution of atom velocities is very broad (see Fig. 1(c) of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al]), in contrast with the expected peak at [formula] and, even more strikingly, failing to show signs of the condensate itself at k = 0. To investigate this, we have performed numerical simulations using roughly the same parameters. The results for [formula] are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:InSitu_Jaskula], as well as the corresponding value of nk for the initial temperature [formula]. The blue curve is that expected for the experiment of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al]. Note that [formula] reaches 109 at the maximum of the resonance. Also plotted, in red and yellow, are the expected values of [formula] after 30 and 15 oscillations (i.e. for 1 / 2 and 1 / 4 of the time after the sudden change in [formula]). Shown in black is an estimate for the maximum allowed value of [formula] before nonlinear effects come into play, and above which the phonons in the resonant mode can no longer be treated as a perturbation on top of the condensate. This is derived from the condition that the integral over the peak in k-space, which gives the total number of produced phonons per unit length, should be significantly smaller than n1, the number of atoms per unit length; in particular, the black line occurs where [formula], or

[formula]

We conjecture that, in the experiment of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al], there was an initial build-up of phonons in the resonant mode, but that the occupation number grew so large that the resonant mode began to interact nonlinearly with the condensate. It would thus be very interesting to observe the broadening of the distribution of the atom velocities when increasing the number of oscillations N. We conclude that, in order to observe the effects of modulated DCE and to hope to see nonseparability, one should either consider the behavior at early time or opt for a smaller change in [formula].

Measuring the state of atoms after TOF

In this Section we consider the switching off of the trap, the subsequent expansion of the cloud and the atom counting measurements able to infer the initial velocities of the atoms from their time of flight. We begin by noting that the expansion itself, as a temporal variation of the condensate, will tend to produce correlated pairs. We then examine to what extent this secondary effect can pollute the results of any prior pair production process.

DCE due solely to the cloud expansion

After having opened the trap and let the cloud expand, the observable quantities that could be measured are given by the distribution of the number of atoms carrying a momentum k. As in the experiments of [\cite=Jaskula-et-al], we integrate over the perpendicular directions so as to count only atoms with longitudinal momentum k. The two observables we shall use are

[formula]

where [formula] and âk ([formula]) destroys (creates) an atom carrying momentum k. The relationship with the c-number quantities of Eq. ([\ref=eq:nandcsq]) and those entering Eqs. ([\ref=eq:n_c_defn]) and ([\ref=eq:nonsep]) is easily made by considering Gaussian isotropic (nk  =  n- k) states. For these, one finds that [formula], so that

[formula]

We see that once more it is the relative strength of the correlation term (here Ck) with respect to a function of the occupation number (here 2n2k) which fixes the sign of Δk. Being positive definite, the denominator plays no role in determining this sign. We also notice that the operators Ĉk  =  n̂kn̂- k and n̂±  k commute, and yet, just as for the density perturbations measured in situ (see Section [\ref=sec:InSitu]), their precise measurement allows us to assess the nonseparability of Gaussian two-mode atomic states (k, - k).

To illustrate this, we begin our analysis by considering the case where both the condensate and the phonons within it are initially in their ground state. (In Appendix [\ref=app:Thermal] we extend this analysis to a thermal bath of phonons.) From the point of view of the phonons, as explained in Sec. [\ref=sub:opening], the expansion will be seen as adiabatic for frequencies much higher than the expansion rate, and sudden by phonons with frequencies much lower than the expansion rate. We thus expect the latter to be excited by the expansion itself, resulting in a nontrivial state of atoms at the corresponding momenta.

In Figure [\ref=fig:TOFalone] are shown examples of the final state of atoms after an expansion of the condensate in response to an opening of the trap. We consider two cases:

a sudden opening of the trap, so that the condensate expands freely with a rate proportional to the initial value of [formula]; we consider several such values, finding that the final occupation number of atoms grows with [formula];

a gradual opening of the trap, with the initial value of [formula] fixed; as already seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_Tozzo_response], this slows the rate of expansion, and we find that the resulting spectrum is qualitatively similar to the case of a sudden opening with a lower initial value of [formula].

Interestingly, we find that no matter how the trap is opened, the final occupation number is always less than [formula], the mean number of atoms initially present in the depletion at zero temperature [\cite=Pitaevskii-Stringari-BEC] (which was observed in [\cite=Vogels-et-al]). More precisely, it approaches [formula] in the limit of a sudden expansion, where the initial phonon frequency ωk  i is much smaller than the expansion rate.

The main lesson one draws from Fig. [\ref=fig:TOFalone] is the following. If one wants to have an adiabatic opening for a certain range of phonons excitations (those with kξ  <  1), one could work with fat cigar-shaped condensates with n1as  ≫  1 and allow [formula] to drop suddenly to zero. However, for such condensates, one cannot neglect the transverse excitations. Hence the only way to have negligible transverse excitations and an adiabatic opening is by controlling the time dependence of [formula], for instance as described in Eq. ([\ref=eq:omega_perp_tanh]) when putting [formula]. Then, if [formula], the rate of expansion will be controlled by a while [formula] drops out, see Fig. [\ref=fig:tanh_Tozzo_response]. The relevant parameter for phonon excitation will then be a / mc2i, which can be as small as experiment will allow.

Combined effects of DCE and expansion

Since the expansion of the condensate itself induces phonon pair production, we must take its contribution to the final atomic state into account when using TOF measurements to investigate a previous DCE. For example, let us consider the results presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:InSitu_G2t_Tanh], in which a slow variation of the condensate is used to excite phonons. We now allow the cloud to expand so that individual atoms can be measured, and so we need to subject the condensate to another change corresponding to this expansion.

In Figure [\ref=fig:TOF_InSitu_Opening] are shown examples of the atom state after the expansion of the cloud. In the upper row, [formula] is switched off suddenly from an initial value of [formula], n1as  =  1.2. Because the spectrum of the original DCE and the spectrum due to the expansion alone overlap significantly, the final atom state is generally different from the phonon state that existed before the expansion. They are closer at high k, where the spectrum due to the expansion becomes negligible, but for low k the expansion is dominant. In particular, at low k, the final value of the nonseparability parameter Δk is essentially determined by the expansion, and hence no conclusion can be drawn concerning the nonseparability of the phonon state prior to opening the trap. These findings are reinforced when working with a temperature such that the phonon state after DCE turns out to be separable, while the final state of atoms of momentum ±  k is nonseparable, see Appendix [\ref=app:Thermal].

We note from the upper row of Fig. [\ref=fig:TOF_InSitu_Opening] that the interference between the two processes produces oscillations in the final results which are not present in the results of either process taken on its own. These vary periodically as a function of the time difference between the original variation of the condensate and its final expansion, but the upper and lower envelopes of the results are independent of this time delay, depending only on the two processes themselves. Effectively, then, the results become "smeared", and it is convenient to plot the envelopes rather than the oscillations themselves. Further examples of this are shown in the lower row of the same figure. There, we plot the envelopes instead of the oscillations within them, and we also show the state that would result due to the expansion alone, in the absence of the original DCE. It is clear that the larger of the two spectra dominates.

In the lower row of Fig. [\ref=fig:TOF_InSitu_Opening], we also include results corresponding to a gradual opening of the trap, where [formula] has the same initial value but varies in the manner of a hyperbolic tangent, as also used in Figs. [\ref=fig:tanh_Tozzo_response] and [\ref=fig:TOFalone]. The key lesson is that, if the expansion alone does not excite phonons at a particular wave vector k, then the state of the atoms of momentum k after the expansion will be exactly the same as the state of the phonons of momentum k before the expansion. As a result, by controlling the opening rate, one can squeeze the effects of the expansion into a narrow window at low k, thus getting closer agreement between the final atomic and initial phononic states at higher k.

Combined effects of modulated DCE and opening the trap

We might also consider the effects of the cloud expansion on the results obtained from the modulated condensate in Sec. [\ref=sub:DCE_modulated]. In this case, however, the results are very similar whether the cloud expansion is taken into account or not, and we are now in a position to understand why. Since the natural oscillation frequency of the condensate is [formula], the resonant phonon mode occurs at [formula], or [formula]. But this is a function of n1as, and in the 1D regime, we have (see Eq. ([\ref=eq:timescaleratio])) [formula]. This means that the resonance occurs at [formula], and the maximum pair production due to the expansion in this regime is [formula]. Typically, it will be much less than this, and will thus have very little effect on the resonance, where [formula] when the number of oscillations N (in the example of Fig. [\ref=fig:InSitu_exp]) is larger than ~  5. We recover here a situation closer to that of Ref. [\cite=deNova-Sols-Zapata], where the authors consider the nonseparability after a sudden opening of the trap in a transonically flowing condensate which engenders a resonant analogue Hawking effect.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have studied pair production of phonon pairs in effectively one-dimensional homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates. We paid particular attention to realistic scenarios and have identified experimentally accessible observations that can be used to determine the nonseparability of the final state.

We first considered the dynamics of the condensate itself, in order to determine what time-varying backgrounds are available in experiments where one typically has control over the harmonic trapping frequency [formula]. We restricted our attention to the 1D regime [formula], where a Gaussian approximation of the transverse profile of the condensate gives accurate results. There are two possibilities of interest: a smooth variation of the condensate from one equilibrium state to another, which occurs when the trap frequency is varied adiabatically; and a steady oscillatory regime of the condensate around its equilibrium state, which occurs in response to a fast variation of the trap frequency.

We then considered the dynamics of the phonon field in response to these time-varying backgrounds, first considering density measurements made in situ and the two-point density correlation function. After noting the behavior of this function in the absence of correlated phonon pairs, and that it can be used to characterize both the temperature and the vacuum fluctuations, we examined its response to the two variations of the condensate mentioned above. In the first case, for a given wave vector, this response is very similar to the response of the condensate to a variation of [formula]: if the variation in ωk is slow, it varies smoothly and always remains in the ground state; but if the variation in ωk is fast, it is excited and oscillates around the ground state. In particular, when the change is sufficiently abrupt or the temperature sufficiently low, the two-point density correlation function oscillates such that it periodically dips below its vacuum value, a behavior that indicates a subfluctuant mode and implies that the 2-mode phonon state (k, - k) is nonseparable.

We also examined the response of the phonons to a sinusoidal modulation of ωk, which is itself caused by the oscillations of the condensate. We focused on the resonance domain where the occupation of the modes grows exponentially with the duration of the modulation. We were thus able to conclude that the very broad spectrum observed in [\cite=Jaskula-et-al] was likely due to a very large occupation of the resonant mode, which had the time to decay into a broad spectrum in a process akin to the preheating phase in the inflationary scenario. We also indicated that a much smaller duration of the oscillatory phase (10 times smaller) should have resulted in a much clearer signal displaying nonseparability in a small range of frequencies centered around the resonant one. It would be particularly interesting to perform observations of the broadening of the spectrum associated with increasing the duration of the modulation so as to probe the first effects of nonlinearities. Finally, we considered the opening of the harmonic trap and the complete expansion of the cloud into individual atoms, which are examined using TOF measurements. We first noted that this expansion itself generates a time-varying background, and began by looking at the pair production associated with the expansion on its own. As a result, depending on the thickness of the cloud, and its temperature, the final state of atoms carrying momentum ±  k can end up entangled even without any DCE prior to the opening of the trap. We then combined this with a DCE performed previously, to see its effect on the final atomic state. We found that, when the two are comparable, they interfere quite strongly, and the results are "smeared" by oscillations that depend on the lapse of time between the original DCE and the expansion. The effects of the final expansion can, however, be tamed by controlling the rate of opening the trap. Then, whenever the pair production due to this slower expansion is much smaller than the pair production due to the original DCE, the final state of the atoms is the same as the initial state of the phonons. In particular, one can then assess nonseparability by considering the relative importance of the strength of the atomic correlations between k and - k with respect to a certain function of the mean occupation number of atoms with these momenta.

We are currently studying the more elaborate case of opening a trap in a condensate with a transonic flow, which corresponds to an analogue black hole.

Validity of the Gaussian approximation

This appendix is devoted to the comparison between results drawn from the Gaussian approximation of Eq. ([\ref=eq:gaussian_ansatz]) and by solving numerically the 3-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with cylindrical symmetry. We first focus on the stationary background solution, briefly recalling the results of [\cite=Gerbier] relevant for our purpose and showing how they compare to numerical solutions. We then turn to the dispersion relation. Besides variations of its shape due to 3-dimensional effects, it shows additional branches which become relevant for high linear densities n1, while their energies, expressed in units of the healing length and sound velocity, become very large for thin condensates. Finally, we briefly comment on the dynamics when the strength of the trapping potential is varied in time, recalling the findings of [\cite=Kagan-Surkov-Shlyapnikov] which justify the use of Eq. [\eqref=eq:sigma_eom] in the main text.

Stationary background solution

In [\cite=Gerbier] is presented a generic procedure to estimate the relationship between the chemical potential μ and linear density n1 of a cylindrically symmetric solution of the GPE, based on minimization of the value of μ on a set of trial Gaussian condensate wave functions. The stationary GPE reads

[formula]

Multiplying it by [formula] and integrating over r with the boundary conditions [formula] gives

[formula]

Using the ansatz of Eq. [\eqref=eq:gaussian_ansatz] and assuming V is harmonic with frequency [formula], the integrals can be performed explicitly; one obtains

[formula]

One recovers the effective potential of Eq. [\eqref=eq:sigma_eom]. When looking for the ground-state solution, μ should be minimized with respect to σ at fixed n1.  This gives

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the index G indicates that these quantities are evaluated using Gaussian trial wave functions.

To verify the validity of this approximation, we solved numerically the stationary GPE with cylindrical symmetry. We used a relaxation method [\cite=Numerical_Recipes] based on the Gross-Pitaevskii action. Starting from an initial Gaussian wave function, a better approximation of a configuration extremizing the discretized action S(d) is obtained by solving the linear equation S(d)2  δΦ0  =    -  α  S(d)1, where S(d)2 denotes the matrix of second derivatives of S(d) with respect to Φ0 and S(d)1 its first derivative. In this expression, δΦ0 is the difference between the approximate and trial solutions, and α is a coefficient which can be tuned to improve the convergence speed or stability. In practice, setting α to 1 offers a good trade-off in most relevant cases. The process is then repeated N times, with N chosen large enough for the results to show no visible deviation when doubling its value.

Results for the density profile in the radial direction are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:app_stat_profiles]. We show the relative difference between the local density ρ computed numerically and its value ρG found using the Gaussian approximation of [\cite=Gerbier], for several values of the quantity n1  as which controls the transition between the 1D and 3D regimes. For thin condensates, i.e., n1  as  <  0.05, relative deviations become important only for large values of r  /  σG where the density is small. For instance, they become larger (in absolute value) than 0.1 only for r  >  1.52  σG, where ρG  /  ρG(0)  <  0.1. More important deviations occur for thicker condensates, the solution for a given value of n1 becoming more extended than its Gaussian approximation because of stronger repulsive interactions between atoms.

In Fig. [\ref=fig:app_mu] we compare the values of μ obtained with the two approaches. To make the comparison clearer, we show the quantity

[formula]

which is identically equal to 1 when using Eqs. [\eqref=eq:app_mu_G] and [\eqref=eq:app_sigma_G]. One can a priori expect the Gaussian approximation to become accurate for n1  as  →  0, where the solution of the GPE is actually a Gaussian, and n1  as  →    ∞  , where a Gaussian ansatz with a large extension gives the Thomas-Fermi result. This is confirmed by Fig. [\ref=fig:app_mu], which indicates that the plotted quantity goes to 1 in these two limits. Moreover, the maximum deviations seem smaller than 0.025, indicating that the Gaussian approximation is quite accurate, as far as the chemical potential is concerned, for all values of n1  as.

Dispersion relation

In this subsection we compare the dispersion relations obtained using Eq. ([\ref=eq:BdGeqn]) and the 3-dimensional Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation in a time-independent background. The first one can be obtained by looking for solutions of Eq. ([\ref=eq:phi-k_eqn]) proportional to e-  iω  t. This gives an algebraic equation which possesses nontrivial solutions iff

[formula]

where c is the velocity of long-wavelength waves. The latter is given (independently of the Gaussian approximation) by [\cite=Menotti-Stringari]

[formula]

Since the Gaussian approximation gives a very good estimate of the chemical potential, see Fig. [\ref=fig:app_mu], one can expect that it also describes well the small-k phonons. Moreover, for large values of k the dispersion relation must become equivalent to the atomic one ω  ~  k2  /  (2  m), which coincides with the large-k limit of Eq. [\eqref=eq:app:DR].

To verify the validity of this equation, we solved numerically the 3-dimensional Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation for modes with no angular momentum. Because of the exponential fall-off in r2 of the background solution as r  →    ∞  , it is more practical to work with absolute perturbations rather than the relative perturbations used in the main text (see Eq. ([\ref=eq:Bog_approx])). Writing Φ  =  Φ0  +  δΦ and looking for solutions with fixed frequency and angular momentum, of the form

[formula]

one obtains the following system of equations on U and W:

[formula]

In general, there are two linearly independent solutions regular at r = 0, but no nontrivial linear combination of them has asymptotically bounded functions U and W. Such a solution exists if and only if ω is a solution of the dispersion relation. Eq. [\eqref=eq:app:BdG_abs] was integrated numerically at fixed k for different value of ω, using an algorithm akin to a shooting method to find these solutions. To make comparison with results from the Gaussian ansatz, we first looked for values of ω close to those given by Eq. [\eqref=eq:app:DR]. The relative differences are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:app_ratio_Omega]. As expected, they are always relatively small, with a maximum only slightly above 0.01 for the parameters we considered.

When looking for solutions further away from those of Eq. [\eqref=eq:app:DR], we found additional branches with larger frequencies for the same wave vector, see the left panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:app_DR_4_branches]. In the thin condensate limit n1  aS  →  0, the full dispersion relation can be computed analytically, giving

[formula]

Interestingly, we found that the difference in ω between two consecutive branches remains nearly constant when increasing n1  as in the range 0  ≤  n1  as  ≤  10. However, it varies significantly when expressed in units of the healing frequency, see the right panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:app_DR_4_branches]. In particular, for n1  as  <  0.1 this difference is of the order of or larger than 10, meaning that these additional branches will be more difficult to excite and can thus be safely neglected.

Dynamics in a time-dependent harmonic potential

In this subsection we recall a result of [\cite=Kagan-Surkov-Shlyapnikov] that justifies the description in Sec. [\ref=sub:response] of the time-evolution of the condensate when varying the strength of the harmonic trap. Let us consider a BEC in 2 dimensions, with a potential of the form

[formula]

Let us assume we know a stationary, real-valued solution Φ(0)0 in the case where [formula] takes the constant value [formula]. One can than look for a solution in the potential of Eq. [\eqref=eq:app:V_time_dep] with a density [formula] of the form

[formula]

where [formula]. A straightforward calculation using the continuity equation gives the velocity [formula] as

[formula]

Plugging [formula] in the GPE [\eqref=eq:GPE], one finds a solution exists if and only if σ obeys Eq. [\eqref=eq:sigma_eom]. The latter is thus an exact equation (as far as the GPE correctly describes the physics at play), independent of the Gaussian approximation.

Thermal effects in TOF experiments

DCE due to a one-time change in c2

In Figure [\ref=fig:TOF_InSitu_Opening_temp], we show non-zero temperature versions of the plots after a slow opening of the trap shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:TOF_InSitu_Opening], but with an initial temperature (i.e. before the initial DCE) of T / mc2  =  1 / 2. Since an initial temperature boosts the final occupation number in exactly the same way for any DCE process, its effect can be viewed as rather trivial since it cannot change the outputs of the initial DCE and of the cloud expansion with respect to each other. Whichever of these is dominant at zero temperature will therefore be dominant at any temperature, and where they strongly interfere at zero temperature, they will also strongly interfere at non-zero temperatures. The overall effect is simply to boost nk, and thus also to diminish the nonseparability parameter Δk. Notice in particular the behavior in the low-k domain, where the atomic state after TOF can be unambiguously nonseparable even though the phononic state before TOF is separable. Thus we see even more clearly than in Fig. [\ref=fig:TOF_InSitu_Opening] how the opening of the trap can pollute the final state, and that control over the rate of expansion is vital if we are to be able to reconstruct the phononic state from TOF measurements.

DCE due to a modulation of c2

When c2 is modulated sinusoidally and [formula] grows exponentially at resonance, an initial temperature can have a very significant impact on the final state. We have already seen, in Fig. [\ref=fig:InSitu_Jaskula], that introducing a temperature can increase the final occupation number so much that it is pushed into the nonlinear regime much earlier than it would have been if the initial temperature were zero. Of course, temperature also affects the final degree of nonseparability. In Figure [\ref=fig:Jaskula_temp] are shown the final values of nk and Δk for an initial temperature [formula] (corresponding to that in [\cite=Jaskula-et-al]). The various curves are for different total numbers of oscillations of the condensate, and in order to have reasonable values, these are much less than the actual value of around 60: we have N  =  4 (blue), 6 (red) and 10 (yellow). Note that, at resonance, the state goes from separable to nonseparable after between 4 and 6 oscillations, whereas it would always be nonseparable if the initial temperature were zero. (These values are still small, largely because the amplitude of the oscillations is large: [formula]).

To make a more explicit connection with experiment, in Figure [\ref=fig:Jaskula_g2_temp] is plotted the two-atom correlation function:

[formula]

Using Eq. ([\ref=Deltasq]) it is clear that g2(k, - k) becomes larger than 2 when Δk  <  0. There are two points to notice. Firstly, the value of g2(k, - k), even at resonance, does not increase monotonically with increasing N and, hence, with increasing nk. Indeed, as nk increases indefinitely, g2(k, - k) approaches 2 from above. Therefore, as was noted in Section [\ref=sub:DCE_modulated], large nk is not necessarily helpful if we want to observe nonseparability, for the nonseparability becomes less visible when the occupation number is large. Secondly, the temperature can also have a large impact on the visibility of nonseparability. (This is related to the first point, since a higher initial temperature requires a larger occupation number before the state actually becomes nonseparable, as was noted in [\cite=Busch-Parentani-Robertson].) On the right of Fig. [\ref=fig:Jaskula_g2_temp] is plotted g2(k, - k) with all parameters the same except for the temperature, which has been reduced by a half. It is clear that g2(k, - k) reaches much further above 2 than it does in the left plot.
