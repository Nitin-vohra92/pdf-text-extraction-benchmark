Some properties of Grauert type surfaces

Introduction

Let X be a complex surface, with a real analytic plurisubharmonic exhaustion function α, such that the regular level sets of α are Levi-flat hypersurfaces, foliated by dense complex leaves; following the classification of the Main Theorem in [\cite=crass], we call X a surface of Grauert type.

It follows from [\cite=mst] that, up to removing a compact complex curve or passing to a holomorphic double cover, there exists a proper pluirharmonic function χ such that [formula].

In this short note we want to analyze some properties of Grauert type surfaces and give an example of the case iii-b of the Main Theorem in [\cite=crass], i.e. an instance where we need to pass to a double holomorphic cover to be able to produce the desired pluriharmonic function.

In Section 2, we study the compact complex curves which can be found in a Grauert type surface and we show that they are all negative curves in the sense of Grauert, sitting in the singular levels of α.

Section 3 is devoted to prove that the level sets of the proper pluriharmonic function χ are connected, showing in some sense that such a function is "minimal" and completing the analogy with the Cartan-Remmert reduction of a holomorphically convex space: for a surface of Grauert type, up to a double cover, we produced a proper pluriharmonic function with connected level sets such that all the other pluriharmonic functions are obtained by composing it with the (pluri)harmonic functions of the image (i.e. linear functions, the image being [formula]).

In Section 4 we construct a family of examples of complex surfaces of Grauert type which do not admit a proper pluriharmonic function, but whose holomorphic double covers do.

Compact curves in Grauert type surfaces

We know from [\cite=mst] that no regular level of χ can contain a compact curve, because this would imply that X is a union of compact complex curves, which is not the case, X being of Grauert type. This section's results inspect what happens in the singular levels, but first we need the analogue of [\cite=mst] for singular curves.

Let W be a complex 2-dimensional manifold and C a compact complex curve in W. Then there is a finite covering {Bj}nj = 1 of C by open subsets of X such that

[formula]

every Bj is simply connected

[formula] is connected for [formula]

whenever [formula], then also [formula] and [formula] is connected, for 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n.

Since C is a semianalytic subset of W, by [\cite=Lo], we find a pair (K,L), with K a locally finite simplicial complex and L  ⊂  K a finite closed subcomplex, which gives a triangulation of the pair (X,C), through a homeomorphism h:(|K|,|L|)  →  (X,C). Consider a barycentric subdivision K1 of K and the induced subdivision L1 of L.

All the simplices are considered to be open. We write [formula] if x is a face of y.

For every a∈L1, we define the star of a with respect to K1 as

[formula]

It is clear that Ba gives, through h, an open, simply connected neighbourhood Ua of h(|a|) in X, which intersects C in a connected set. L1 being a finite subcomplex, its vertices are in finite number, hence we have a finite collection of open sets Ua with a a vertex of L1.

If [formula], we find a simplex [formula] and it is not difficult to show that its edge (a,b) is contained in L1. In terms of open sets Ua, Ub, we obtained that if [formula] then [formula] as well.

Finally, since [formula] is a union of simplices of K1 and every such simplex has (a,b) as a face, [formula], i.e. the star of (a,b) in K1; therefore it is connected.

Now, we are in the position to formulate and prove the counterpart of Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=mst] for critical levels.

Let [formula] be a pluriharmonic function on a complex surface W; assume that d is a critical value of χ and that the level set {χ = d} contains a connected compact complex curve C. Then

there exist a neighborhood V of C and nonconstant holomorphic function [formula] such that G vanishes on C;

if, in addition, W is a Grauert type surface, we can construct G such that {G = 0} is connected but different from C.

Choose a covering [formula] of C as given by Lemma [\ref=ottobre]. Consider χ|Vj, j fixed. Assuming r > 0 small enough so that Vj is contained in a topological ball in W, we conclude that χ has a pluriharmonic conjugate in this ball, and so in Vj, say [formula]. Since χ|C = d, a constant, we conclude that its harmonic conjugate on [formula] is locally constant. Since [formula] is connected [formula] is constant. Subtracting the latter constant from τ'j we obtain a function [formula] such that

τj is a pluriharmonic conjugate of χ|Vj;

[formula]

Consider now two intersecting neighborhoods Vj, Vk and define [formula] Since V0 is connected, τj  -  τk = a constant in V0 and so [formula] in V0, because [formula]. (Note that [formula] if [formula].) Thus τj(p) = τk(p), whenever [formula]. Consequently, the family {τj}nj = 1 defines a single-valued pluriharmonic function [formula], where [formula], such that F(p)   =   χ(p) + iτ(p), p∈V, is holomorphic.

Therefore, there exists F∈O(V), a non constant holomorphic function, such that F|C = d. We take d = 0, proving (1).

To show (2), suppose that W is a Grauert type surface and, by contradiction, that C is a connected component of {F = 0}. Take V0  ⊆  V connected such that [formula] is proper and [formula]. Obviously, χ(V0) is an open interval in [formula] and it contains at least one regular value t0; consider p0∈V0 such that χ(p0) = t0 and define

[formula]

By properness, this is a compact complex curve in χ- 1(t0); but, W being a Grauert type surface, regular levels of χ are foliated by dense (hence non compact) complex curves. This is a contradiction, so C cannot be a connected component of {F = 0}.

The previous result is enough for our purposes, however, we can prove a bit more about compact curves in Grauert type surfaces.

We recall that a compact complex curve C in a complex surface X is said to be negative if it has negative self-intersection or, equivalently, if O( - C) has a nonzero section.

It is a celebrated result of Grauert (see [\cite=Gra]) that this is equivalent to being contractible, i.e. to the existence of a proper holomorphic map f:X  →  X' onto a complex space X', a biholomorphism outside C, such that f(C) consists of just one point.

Therefore, negative curves arise as a result of modification of complex (possibly singular) surfaces. We state the next result for any W not foliated in compact curves, which includes Grauert type surfaces and modification of Stein spaces, thus presenting also an alternative proof of part (2) of the previous Lemma.

Let W, χ, d, C be as in Lemma [\ref=Atropo]; if W is not foliated in compact curves, then C is negative.

Let {Uj} be an open convering of C such that for each j there exists a function fj∈O(Uj) with [formula]. The functions fi / fj, defined whenever [formula], represent the cocycle of the line bundle O(C); if such a bunlde were trivial, the function fj would glue into a global defining function for C, [formula], where [formula]. Hence, Cζ  =  {p∈U : G(p) = ζ} would be a compact curve, for |ζ| small enough; at least one of such curves would be contained in a regular level of χ, so, by Theorem 4.2 in [\cite=mst], W would be foliated in complex curves.

Therefore, O(C) is not trivial. Consider the holomorphic function [formula] given by Lemma [\ref=Atropo]-(1) and the collection of functions {F / fj}j, each defined on [formula]; such collection defines a nonzero holomorphic section σ of the line bundle [formula]. As this line bundle is not trivial, σ has to vanish at some point of C. This implies that C  ·  C < 0, i.e. C is negative in the sense of Grauert.

In particular, any compact curve in a Grauert type surface, apart from the absolute minimum set of the real analytic plurisubharmonic exhaustion function, were this of real dimension ≤  2, is negative.

Level sets of pluriharmonic functions

We need first some auxiliary facts about convergent sequences of analytic sets. For a discussion of the various definitions of convergence, see [\cite=chi] or [\cite=two]. It is convenient for us to reformulate these definitions in the following manner.

Let Y be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Let {Fn} be a sequence of non-empty closed subsets of Y. We say that lim sup n  →    +    ∞Fn  ⊂  F, where F is a closed subset of Y, if for every compact subset [formula] there is an index n0 such that for n > n0, [formula]. We say that lim sup n  →    +    ∞Fn = F0, if

[formula]

Then, using [\cite=two] we can define that the sequence {Fn} is convergent to F0 (lim n  →    +    ∞Fn = F0) if

lim sup n  →    +    ∞Fn = F0;

for every y0∈F0 there is a sequence {yn} such that yn∈Fn, [formula] and lim n  →    +    ∞yn = y0.

Observe that lim sup n  →    +    ∞Fn always exists lim n  →    +    ∞Fn not always.

Although we believe the following proposition to be well known, we will give a sketch of proof.

(Sketch) Suppose, by contradiction, that F does not have the local maximum property, then, by [\cite=Sl2], there are y∈F, B = B(y,r) with r > 0, an ε > 0 and a strongly plurisubharmonic function on [formula] such that u(y) = 0 and

[formula]

By the very definition of limit superior of analytic sets we have

[formula]

moreover, since u is continuous, we have that

[formula]

Now, it follows again from the definition of limit superior of analytic sets that there is a subsequence Fnk and a sequence of points (yk) such that yk∈Fnk and lim yk = y, therefore lim u(yk) = u(y) = 0. Hence, there exists k0 such that

[formula]

by [\eqref=Mercuzio] and [\eqref=Tebaldo]; so

[formula]

which contradicts the local maximum property of Fnk0.

Let W be a complex manifold and {Fn} a sequence of closed complex analytic subsets of W of pure dimension 1. Assume that F0: =  lim sup n  →    +    ∞Fn is contained in a complex analytic subset F of W, F also of pure dimension 1. Then F0 is the union of some of the irreducible components of F.

(Sketch) Let V be a connected component of Freg. V is a Riemann surface. If [formula], and [formula], i.e. has a boundary point x0 in V, then F0 fails to have local maximum property. Thus [formula] is the union of a family of connected components Vα of Freg, i.e. [formula], where each [formula] is an irreducible variety.

The following fact is a special case of a much more general result in [\cite=two].

Let W be a complex manifold of dimension 2. Let Z1 and Z2 be (closed) complex analytic subsets of W, of pure dimension 1. Assume that [formula] is discrete. Now let {Fn} be a sequence of complex analytic sets of pure dimension 1 converging to Z2. Then [formula] for n large enough.

The corresponding result in [\cite=two] is stated only in [formula] requiring [formula] to be finite, but since it is essentially local, it is true for complex manifolds and with [formula] discrete without need to change the proof.

Of course the whole point of this result is that it holds when Z is reducible (otherwise it is a trivial consequence of Corollary [\ref=lisup1]).

Denote Z2  =   lim n  →    +    ∞Fn. Suppose that Z2  ≠  Z. By Corollary [\ref=lisup1], Z2 is the union of some family of irreducible components of Z. Denote by Z1 the union of the remaining irreducible components of Z. As it is well known, the family of all irreducible components being locally finite, Z1, Z2 are closed, [formula] discrete and closed. Since Z is connected, [formula] is nonempty.

Applying Corollary [\ref=lisup2], we deduce that [formula] for n large enough, but this contradicts assumption ii), unless [formula] and Z =  lim n  →    ∞Fn.

It is clear that the assumption of irreducibility or even connectdness of Fn is not needed, and was actually not used in the proof.

Let W be a complex manifold of dimension 2 and D a domain in W. Let [formula] be a holomorphic function. Let C be a (possibly reducible) connected compact complex curve in D, such that f = 0 on C, and that the subset {x∈D:f(x) = 0} is connected and different from C. Then C cannot separate any of its relative neighborhoods in the level set {χ = 0} where [formula].

Consider any connected neighborhood U of C in W, such that [formula] is connected. By diminishing U (if needed), we can assume also that the variety Z: = {f = 0} is connected. It is crucial for the proof that [formula] is nonempty. Suppose that [formula] is disconnected, and that (Aj) is the family (finite or countable) of its pairwise disjoint relatively open connected components, i.e. [formula] Observe that [formula] and [formula] for every j.

Consider now any set Aj. Denote [formula]. Observe that λ cannot be constant on Aj, because then χ|Aj  =  λ|Aj = 0 and consequently Aj  ⊂  {f = 0} is not relatively open in {χ = 0}. Thus λ(Aj) is an interval, either (0,ε0) or ( - δ0,0), ε0,δ0 > 0. Let {tn} be a sequence of values belonging to λ(Aj), such that lim n  →    +    ∞tn = 0. The sets

[formula]

are nonempty for every n. Denote by Fn any of the (irreducible) connected components of this set. Since f is continuous, lim sup n  →    +    ∞Fn  ⊂  Z. By the properties of the topology of (locally uniform convergence) of closed sets defined above, Fn has a convergent subsequence, which we still denote by {Fn}. By Theorem [\ref=lisup3] lim n  →    +    ∞Fn = Z and so [formula]. Moreover, [formula]. It follows that [formula], and so [formula] is nonempty. This is a contradiction.

Let W,B be normal, Hausdorff topological spaces and f:W  →  B a continuous, proper, surjective map such that

[formula]

for every b∈B, for every Y connected component of f- 1(b) there is U a neighbourhood of b such that if X0 is the connected component of f- 1(U) containing Y then for every b'∈U, [formula] is connected and non empty.

If B is simpy connected, and W is connected, then f- 1(b) is connected for every b∈B.

Define on W the following equivalence relation: given u,w∈W, we write u  ~  w if f(u) = f(w) and both lay in the same connected component of f- 1(f(u)). Let π:W  →  W /   ~   be the quotient map. It is easy to check that the map induced by f, namely :W /   ~    →  B, is a covering map by [formula], together with properness of f.

As B is simply connected, the covering spaces of B can be only disjoint unions of copies of B, but if W is connected, so is W /   ~  . Therefore [formula] is an homeomorphism, hence f- 1(b) is connected for every b∈B (and non empty by surjectivity).

We note that a locally trivial fibration satisfies condition [formula].

We will prove that f enjoys property [formula] from Lemma [\ref=sconnessione].

Consider [formula] and let Y be a connected component of f- 1(t0). There exists δ > 0 such that no critical values of f are contained in (t0  -  δ,t0) or (t0,t0  +  δ). Let X0 be the connected component of

[formula]

containing Y.

Up to taking δ small enough, If [formula], then [formula] and, by Ehresmann theorem (see Theorem 9.3 and Remark 9.4 in [\cite=voi]), all the level sets are diffeomorphic. In particular, Y being connected, every level set of f|X0 is connected; moreover, as Y does not contain critical points, it cannot be neither a maximum nor a minimum set for f, hence there is δ' > 0 such that f(X0)  ⊇  (t0  -  δ',t0  +  δ').

If [formula], consider [formula] as a (connected) submanifold of [formula], which is also connected. Take U to be a tubular neighbourhood of Y' in X0' and set

[formula]

By definition, Y' is disjoint from Crt(f), so it cannot contain extremal points for f, therefore U+ and U- are both non empty and disjoint; moreover, U is diffeomorphic to the total space of a (real) line bundle over Y', hence [formula] has at most 2 connected components, so U+ and U- are connected.

Obviously, [formula]; let V be a connected component of X+0.

As X0' is connected and V  ≠  X0', [formula] is nonempty. Since V is relatively closed in X0', [formula]. Thus [formula] is non empty and so is [formula] (because [formula]); as this holds for every connected component of X+0 and as U+ is connected, we conclude that X+0 is connected.

By Ehresmann theorem, f|X+0 is a locally trivial fibration, hence satisfies condition [formula] and f(X0) is a connected subset of [formula], i.e. an interval, which is simply connected. By Lemma [\ref=sconnessione], all the level sets are connected.

The same holds for X-0 and hence for X0. Moreover, it is clear that there exists δ'' > 0 such that f(X0)  ⊇  (t0  -  δ'',t0  +  δ'').

Hence, f enjoys property [formula]. Applying again Lemma [\ref=sconnessione], we conclude that every level set of f is connected and, by surjectivity, non empty.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=lisu] Let C be any connected component of the critical set of χ.

The critical set is locally defined by holomorphic equations ∂χ  /  ∂z = 0, ∂χ  /  ∂z = 0, where z,w are local coordinates. It follows that C is a complex curve (possibly reducible). Moreover, since χ|C = c, c a constant, and χ is proper, C is compact complex curve or a point.

Claim: C cannot separate any of its relative neighborhoods in the level χ = c.

As X is of Grauert type, by Lemma [\ref=Atropo]-(2) there exist a neighbourhood U of C in X and a holomorphic function [formula] such that [formula]. Our claim follows from Lemma [\ref=lisup4].

In case C is just a point p, the proof is similar, just simpler. We can take for U a simply-connected neighborhood of p and λ the conjugate of χ|U, f = χ + iλ - c in U. Shrink U so that [formula] is connected. Clearly, Z  ≠  C. Inspection of the proof of Lemma [\ref=lisup4] shows that it holds for C- a single point- without any change. The claim is proved.

As χ satistfies the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=affettato], we conclude that the level sets of χ are connected. [formula]

The following Corollary is obvious.

Grauert type surfaces have at most two ends.

A class of examples

The purpose of this section is to provide examples to show that passing to a double cover in the case iii-b of the Main Theorem proved in [\cite=mst] is unavoidable. The result can summarized as follows. The surface [formula] discussed in Theorem [\ref=teo1] will be obtained by modification of [\cite=mst]. In rough outline, consider compact Riemann surfaces M which admit a fixed-point free conformal involution S, and [formula] the space of some, topologically trivial, line bundle on M without the 0 section, where the line bundle transformed by S is equivalent to the dual line bundle. There are more details to be taken care of, as discussed next.

We will show, in fact, that there exist infinitely many such surfaces.

Before starting with our construction, we recall a rather elementary result.

Let g > 0 be an odd integer. Then there exists a compact Riemann surface Mg of genus g with a conformal involution S:Mg  →  Mg without fixed points.

We have g = 2g' - 1 for some positive integer g'. Let Σ be a compact Riemann surface of genus g' and let π:V  →  Σ be a (topological) double cover of Σ. Such a double cover exists because, for example, the abelianization of π1(Σ), which is [formula], admits a surjection on [formula]. Therefore the fundamental group of Σ has a (normal) subgroup of index 2.

Now, we can pull back the complex structure from Σ to V, giving it the structure of a Riemann surface, so that π becomes a holomorphic map; by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for an unramified cover of degree 2, χ(V) = 2χ(Σ) and, remembering that χ(Mg) = 2 - 2g, we immediately obtain that the genus of V is 2g' - 1.

Then V is our Mg and we have that there exists S∈(Mg) such that Σ  =  Mg  /  {I,S}. Hence S is the involution we were looking for.

S-antisymmetric bundles and cocycles

We recall now some basic definitions and notation.

If S is an automorphism of a Riemann surface M and ξ a complex line bundle with cocycle {ξij}i,j∈A, [formula], where {Ui}i∈A is an open covering of M, we denote by S(ξ) the S-image (i.e. the pushforward by S) of ξ, by which we understand the line bundle with the defining cocycle {kij}i,j∈A, where [formula] is [formula], corresponds to the covering {S- 1(Ui)}i∈A.

From now on we assume S is an involution without fixed points, i.e. [formula] and S(m)  ≠  m for all m∈M.

Crucial to our construction are S - antisymmetric line bundles i.e, such that [formula] ( "=" means line bundle equivalence; more precise requirements will be indicated in terms of cocycles). Since S-image preserves Chern numbers, while ξ  ↦  ξ- 1 reverses them, S-antisymmetric bundles have Chern number 0, and so are topologically trivial. As well known, they can be represented by flat unimodular cocycles {ξi,j}, i.e. ξi,j  =  {const} in [formula], |ξi,j| = 1 (and, of course, ξijξjk  =  ξik).

Our surface [formula] will be the space of an S-anntisymmetric line bundle η over M minus its 0 section, where S is fixed-points free but in order to define on [formula] a biholomorphic involution (determined by S), we need to use an S-antisymmetric cocycle defined next.

Another useful concept will be that of S-stable covering.

We notice that, given any covering {Wj}j∈A of M, we can produce an S-stable covering subordinated to that: for every p∈M, let Up be a neighbourhood of p such that

[formula]

[formula] such that Up  ⊆  Wk, S(Up)  ⊆  Wh.

Now, take [formula] such that [formula] is a covering of M and reindex such covering so that S(Uj) = Uj + n for [formula].

Let ξ be an S-antisymmetric bundle. Then [formula] admits an S-antisymmetric unimodular representing cocycle with respect to an S-stable covering.

First of all, we note that also [formula] is an S-antisymmetric bundle.

We have that S(ξ) = ξ- 1, so there exists a covering {Wj}j∈A with respect to which the cocycles of S(ξ) and ξ- 1 are equivalent.

We can refine the covering to an S-stable one [formula], so that, if [formula] is the cocycle representing ξ- 1, then [formula] is the cocycle representing S(ξ).

We suppose that [formula] and [formula] are simply connected for every i,j.

Therefore, there exists a 0-cochain {φj}, [formula], such that

[formula]

on [formula]. Note that we also have

[formula]

Dividing the last two equations sideways and cancelling the η-terms, we obtain

[formula]

Thus, these ratios define a non-vanishing holomorphic function on M. Hence, there is a nonzero complex number [formula] such that

[formula]

for every [formula].

Let now νij  =  φiη2ijφ- 1j; this is a cocycle representing [formula]. Moreover:

[formula]

Therefore, we have an S-antisymmetric cocycle [formula] with respect to the covering [formula]. It is easy to see that, if ηij was taken to be unimodular, so is ξij.

We note that, if we apply twice [\eqref=Milano], we obtain that c2 = 1, i.e. [formula]. Moreover, this number depends only on the cohomology class of ξ; if c = 1, we could already produce an S-antisymmetric representing cocycle for ξ.

The proof uses some basic facts about Picard variety, P(M), of the Riemann surface, for which we refer to Gunning [\cite=GU]. P(M) has several descriptions; in the one crucial for us it is the group of (holomorphic equivalence classes of) complex line bundles of Chern class 0 (i.e. topologically trivial) on M. With the operation of tensor product P(M) becomes a group. For a positive genus g of M, P(M) can be given a complex structure with which it becomes a complex Lie group, specifically a complex torus of complex dimension g, [\cite=GU].

Consider the map Ψ:P(M)  →  P(M) defined by Ψ(ξ): = ξS(ξ), ξ∈P(M). It is clear that Ψ is a homomorphism of complex Lie groups. The image of Ψ is contained in the subgroup of line bundles η such that η = S(η); these line bundles are pullbacks of line bundles on M / {I,S}, so their subgroup is a complex torus of dimension (g + 1) / 2.

Consider [formula]; this is a Lie subgroup of P(M), and it cannot be countable (or finite) as P(M) / K  =  Ψ(P(M)) is contained in a complex torus of dimension (g + 1) / 2 < g, as g > 1.

Recall now that, as a real Lie group, P(M) is isomorphic to the real torus [formula]. The unipotent line bundles correspond to the points of real torus with all coordinates rational, and so form a countable set. Since K cannot be countable, it must contain a non-unipotent bundle η which proves the proposition.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=teo1]

Following Lemma [\ref=lemma_odd], let M be a compact Riemann surface of odd genus g > 1, with a conformal involution S:M  →  M without fixed points.

By Proposition [\ref=pro2], we have a non-unipotent S-antisymmetric line bundle η on M, whose square [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem5], can be represented with a unimodular S-antisymmetric cocycle [formula], with respect to an S-stable covering [formula].

Let [formula] be the total space of ν minus the zero section M. Using local trivializations on the S-stable covering [formula], we will construct a holomorphic involution [formula] and a proper pluriharmonic function [formula].

Let [formula] be the restriction to [formula] of the projection map of the bundle ν; [formula], so that [formula] can be given as the union of charts [formula], glued together with the following equivalence relation: if [formula], [formula] then

[formula]

Define on each chart a pluriharmonic function [formula] by χi(p,w) =  log |w|. Since |νij| = 1 in [formula], [formula] and so they define a single-valued pluriharmonic function [formula]; it is easy to verify that [formula] is proper.

To define a biholomorphic involution T of [formula], define first maps of charts

[formula]

by

[formula]

Since S(Ui) = Ui + n it is clear that Ti is well defined (here and in what follows, the indexes are to be understood mod 2n), and that

[formula]

[formula]

It remains to check that whenever charts [formula] and [formula] overlap, Ti and Tj are equal on [formula].

Let [formula], [formula] and (p,w1)  ~  (q,w2) i.e. [formula] and w1  =  νij(p)w2. Then also (S(p),1 / w1)  ~  (S(q),1 / w2); indeed, [formula], because [formula], and [formula], so

[formula]

Therefore Ti(p,w1)  ~  Tj(q,w2). It follows that the family {Ti} defines one biholomorphic involution [formula].

It is clear from the definition that T does not have fixed points if S does not.

We verify now that [formula].

If [formula], T(p,w) = (S(p),1 / w) and

[formula]

We define [formula]. This function is clearly plurisubharmonic and exhaustive, being proper and bounded from below.

As we know from [\cite=mst], if ν is not unipotent, [formula] is a Grauert type surface (in particular each complex leaf is dense in the level set of [formula] which contain it).

So far, we have proved points (1) and (2). The group 〈T〉  =  {I,T} acting freely and properly discontinuously on [formula], we define the quotient

[formula]

which is a holomorphic covering map between complex surfaces. The function [formula] descends as a real analytic plurisubharmonic exhaustion function α on X; the levels of α are still Levi flat hypersurfaces with dense leaves, hence X is a Grauert type surface, showing (3).

Now, consider [formula] a pluriharmonic function; we can lift it to [formula], again pluriharmonic, so that [formula] for some constants [formula] by [\cite=mst]. Since [formula], we have that

[formula]

so a = 0 and χ is constant. This proves (4). [formula]
