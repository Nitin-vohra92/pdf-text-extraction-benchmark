Fractal Strichartz estimate for the wave equation

Introduction

Let us consider the wave equation in [formula]:

[formula]

The space-time estimate for the solution of [\eqref=wveq] which is called Strichartz estimate has been proven to be an important tool in studies of various problems. (See [\cite=st] [\cite=pe] [\cite=km] [\cite=ls] [\cite=MS] [\cite=kt].) It is well-known that the estimate

[formula]

holds for s  ≥  0,2  ≤  q,r  <    ∞   which satisfy

[formula]

Here [formula] is the homogeneous L2 Sobolev space of order s. See [\cite=FW] for the estimates with r =   ∞  . It was Strichartz [\cite=st] who first proved the estimate [\eqref=stri] when q = r. This was later extended to mixed norm estimates by Pecher [\cite=pe]. (Also see [\cite=GV].) The endpoint cases (r,q)  =  (2(n - 1) / (n - 3),2) except n = 3 were obtained by Keel-Tao [\cite=kt]. Klainerman and Machedon [\cite=km] showed the failure of [\eqref=stri] when (n,r,q) = (3,  ∞  ,2).

In this note we consider a generalization of [\eqref=stri] by replacing the Lebesgue measure with general measure μ. More precisely, we study the estimate

[formula]

Here we denote by [formula] the inhomogeneous L2 Sobolev space of order s, which is the space of all tempered distributions f such that [formula], equipped with the norm

[formula]

This kind of estimates was studied in connection with problems in geometric measure theory, precisely, the sphere packing problem (see [\cite=Mi] [\cite=w] [\cite=ob] [\cite=ob2]).

Throughout this paper, the measure μ is assumed to be a nonnegative Borel regular measure with compact support in [formula]. Let us denote by [formula] the space of such measures. In addition we impose uniform growth condition on μ as follows.

Let α∈(0,n + 1]. For [formula], we say that μ is α-dimensional if there exists a constant Cμ, independent of x and ρ, such that

[formula]

Here B(x,ρ) denotes the open ball of radius ρ centered at x. Also we define

[formula]

For 1  ≤  q  ≤    ∞   let us set

[formula]

When n = 2 Wolff [\cite=w] showed that [\eqref=fstrichartz] holds for α-dimensional measure μ if [formula], α∈(1,3). Erdo[formula]an [\cite=er3] improved Wolff's result so that [\eqref=fstrichartz] holds for s > s(α,q,2), α∈(1,3) and also showed that [\eqref=fstrichartz] generally fails if s < s(α,q,2). When [formula], Oberlin [\cite=ob] obtained [\eqref=fstrichartz] for α∈(1,n + 1) provided that q < α and [formula].

It is plausible to conjecture that [\eqref=fstrichartz] holds if s > s(α,q,n) (see Proposition [\ref=prop:necessary]) but like other open problems of similar nature complete resolution seems out of reach at this moment. However, for n = 3 and α∈[1,4], we obtain the sharp estimate by the following theorem and Proposition [\ref=prop:necessary].

Let n = 3. Also let μ be an α-dimensional measure. Suppose that u is a solution to the equation [\eqref=wveq]. Then [\eqref=fstrichartz] holds with

[formula]

Furthermore, the implicit constant in [\eqref=fstrichartz] does not depend on particular choice of μ as long as 〈μ〉α is uniformly bounded.

For δ > 0 and R  ≫  1, let us define the truncated cone ΓR by

[formula]

and its δ-neighborhood by

[formula]

Note that the space-time Fourier transform of u is supported in the forward and backward light cones. By reflection in frequency spaces, Littlewood-Paley decomposition, and Plancherel theorem, Theorem [\ref=wave] is a consequence of the following. (For details, see the end of Section [\ref=sec:rescaling].)

Let n = 3 and μ be an α-dimensional measure supported in [formula]. Then, for f supported in ΓR(1) there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

holds if s satisfies [\eqref=scon3].

In general, s(α,q,n), n  ≥  3 provides a lower bound on s for [\eqref=frac] to hold.

Suppose that for any α-dimensional measure μ, there is a constant C > 0 such that [\eqref=frac] holds whenever f is supported in [formula]. Then s  ≥  s(α,q,n) for 1  ≤  q  ≤    ∞  .

In order to show this, we construct α-dimensional measures and functions for which [formula] fails if s < s(α,q,n). For α∈(1,n + 1], we modify the examples in [\cite=er3] and for α∈(0,1] we use the construction in [\cite=HL]. (See Section [\ref=sec:sharpness] for details.) For each α some of the conditions appearing in [\eqref=necessary] are natural in view of dilation and rescaling structure of the estimate [\eqref=frac]. To be precise, for the case n  <  α  ≤  n + 1 in [\eqref=necessary] the condition [formula] may be understood as a homogeneity condition and [formula] is related to the Knapp type example. A similar statement also applies to the case 1 < α  ≤  n.

In contrast with the Lebesgue measure, there is no obvious scaling structure for a general α-dimensional measure. But, as is to be seen in what follows, if we assume uniform bound which only depends on 〈μ〉α, the measure μ can be handled as if it is homogeneous of degree α with respect to isotropic dilation. This observation plays an important role throughout the paper. Similar idea was used in [\cite=HL] to obtain restriction estimate for the curve with respect to general measures other than the Lebesgue measure.

The estimate [\eqref=frac] is closely related to Fourier restriction problem. We make use of the bilinear approach which was extensively utilized to tackle the restriction problem. Some aspects of our paper are similar to those of [\cite=er3]. However, unlike [\cite=er3] we use the induction on scale argument in more direct way without relying on weighted inequality and this enables us to expose underlying structure more clearly. Also our argument can be used to recover the results in [\cite=er3]. It is natural to expect that multilinear restriction estimates [\cite=BCT] and its recent development (see [\cite=BG] [\cite=G]) can be used for further improvement of the estimate [\eqref=fstrichartz]. However, it does not seem likely that these estimates would give the sharp estimate such as our result in Theorem [\ref=wave].

In this paper we will prove [\eqref=frac] for [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=thecone1]) while our results are sharp only for n = 3. (The sharp estimates for n = 2 and [formula] was previously obtained by Erdoan [\cite=er3].) When n  ≥  4, the necessary condition s  ≥  s(α,q,n) (except the equality case) is sufficient only for n < α  ≤  n + 1 or for large q if α  ≤  n.

[formula]

for R > 1 and any ε > 0. This can be shown by the argument in [\cite=w2] which makes use of Lemma 1.5 and duality. (See Section 2 in [\cite=w2] for details.)

The average decay estimate over the sphere has been studied in connection with Falconer's distance set conjecture. (See [\cite=Matt1], [\cite=b1], [\cite=w2], [\cite=er2], [\cite=er1], [\cite=LR] and references therein.)

Let [formula] and P be a Borel set in [formula] with dim H(P)  >  1. Assume that [formula] for any (x,r)∈P. Then |E|n > 0.

Wolff [\cite=w] proved that Corollary [\ref=corollary] is valid when n = 2. When n  ≥  3, Oberlin [\cite=ob] showed that the statement holds by obtaining estimate for the spherical average.

Bilinear estimates

In this section we prove a bilinear version of the estimate [\eqref=frac] which is closely related to bilinear restriction estimate for the cone ([\cite=tvv] [\cite=tv1] [\cite=w3] [\cite=tao-bilinear] [\cite=le]). Under an additional transversality condition, bilinear estimate gives formally better estimate than linear one by weakening Kakeya compression phenomena.

For a function f which is supported away from the origin we define the angular support f by

[formula]

The following may be regarded as a generalization of bilinear restriction estimate for the cone in [\cite=w3].

Let R  ≫  1 and let μ be an α-dimensional measure supported in [formula]. Suppose that f and g are supported in ΓR(1) and

[formula]

For 2  ≤  q  ≤    ∞  , there is a constant C  =  C(β,n) such that

[formula]

for any [formula].

Since [formula] and [formula], [\eqref=bi] trivially holds with 2β  ≥  n. It is easy to verify that the condition [formula] is necessary by adopting the examples which are used to show the necessity of the condition [\eqref=scaling]. Another necessary condition for [\eqref=bi] with α > 2 is

[formula]

To see this, we consider the squashed cap function (see [\cite=tvv]) and a suitable measure. Precisely, let us set dμ  =  ψ(x)|x''|- n - 1 + αdx1dx2dx'', x = (x1,x2,x'') for a smooth cutoff function ψ. Then μ is an α-dimensional measure if n + 1  ≥  α > 2. Considering a pair of characteristic functions f,g supported in ΓR(1) with large angular separation and dimensions [formula] it is easy to show [\eqref=bilinear-condition].

Let β  ≥  0, [formula]. Suppose that [\eqref=bi] is valid for any α-dimensional measure μ supported in [formula], and for any f, g supported in ΓR(A) for some A  ~  1 satisfying the condition [\eqref=angular-separation]. Then, for [formula] and ρ  ≤  (10A)- 1,

[formula]

By translation we may assume x0 = 0 without loss of generality.

Since the map [formula] is a positive linear functional on [formula], by the Riesz representation theorem there exists a Radon measure μρ such that

[formula]

for any continuous function φ. Then it is obvious that μρ is supported in [formula] and 〈μρ〉α  ≤  〈μ〉α. Let us set fρ  =  ρ- n - 1f(  ·    /  ρ), gρ  =  ρ- n - 1g(  ·    /  ρ). Then, it follows that

[formula]

We note that fρ and gρ are supported in the set ΓRρ(Aρ). Since the measure μρ is supported in [formula], we may put a harmless smooth function η in the integral which satisfies   ~  1 on [formula] and [formula]. Then we see

[formula]

Note that [formula] and [formula] are supported in ΓRρ(1). Hence, from [\eqref=bi] we have

[formula]

Since fρ and gρ are supported in ΓRρ(Aρ), [formula] and [formula]. Therefore [\eqref=local1] follows by [\eqref=local2] and [\eqref=local3].

Let R  ≫  1 and 0 < δ  ≤  1. Let [formula] be a collection of cubes of sidelength ~  R-  δ which partition the cube n + 1. Suppose f and g are supported in ΓR(1) and satisfy [\eqref=angular-separation]. Then for each [formula], f and g can be decomposed such that

[formula]

with [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] supported in ΓR(Cd) for some Cd  ~  1 and, for 0 < ε  ≪  δ,

[formula]

with c independent of δ and ε.

Let F and G be functions supported in Γ1(R- 1). Then, by using wave packet decomposition ([\cite=tao-bilinear] [\cite=le]), on B(0,R) we may write

[formula]

where cwi and pwi satisfy the following:

[formula]

Here Wi is the set of all pairs wi  =  (yi,vi) with [formula] and [formula] and Twi is defined by

[formula]

for each wi∈Wi, i = 1,2.

Partition n + 1 into R1 - δ-cubes [formula] which are essentially disjoint. Then,

[formula]

Now we use the relation ~   between wi and R1 - δ cube [formula] which was introduced in [\cite=tao-bilinear] (also see [\cite=le]). For [formula] fixed, we say [formula] if [formula] and, otherwise, we say [formula]. We keep the same notation ~   since it does not cause any ambiguity. We now set

[formula]

Then, by repeating the argument in [\cite=tao-bilinear] [\cite=le] it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

Since we are dealing with functions F and G which are supported in Γ1(R- 1) instead of being supported on the surfaces, we obtain an extra power R- 1 compared to the extension operator (cf. [\cite=tao-bilinear] [\cite=le]).

Since f,g are supported in ΓR(1) and satisfy [\eqref=angular-separation], we apply the above to

[formula]

Then, the change of variable x  →  x / R gives the desired estimates [\eqref=l2sumq] and [\eqref=bil2].

To prove Theorem [\ref=bifrac] we make use of the following simple lemma.

Let R  ≫  1 and μ be an α-dimensional measure supported in [formula]. Set φR = Rn + 1φ(R  ·  ) for a Schwartz function φ. Then, for any r  ≥  1 and any Schwartz function φ, there is a constant C, independent of μ, such that

[formula]

By rapid decay of φ it follows that [formula] for all N > 0. Hence, recalling the definition of 〈μ〉α in Definition 1.1 and choosing a sufficiently large N, we have

[formula]

This yields [\eqref=convolution] with r =   ∞  . Since μ is supported in [formula], we also have [formula] where [formula]. So, from Young inequality [formula]. Hence, [\eqref=convolution] follows from [formula] for any r  ≥  1.

It is sufficient to show the case 2  ≤  q  ≤  4. Extension to q  ≥  4 can be obtained by interpolation with the trivial estimate

[formula]

which is valid since [formula] and q are continuous.

In what follows we prove the implication from [\eqref=bi] to [\eqref=imply]. We assume that [\eqref=bi] holds for some β > 0 and f,g supported in ΓR(1). As is mentioned before, this is true with a large β > 0. Since μ is supported in [formula], we have

[formula]

Using the decomposition in Lemma [\ref=wavepacket], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=localization], it follows that

[formula]

Schwarz inequality and [\eqref=l2sumq] give

[formula]

For the other terms in [\eqref=qube] we use [\eqref=bil2]. Let η be a Schwartz function such that (ξ) = 1 if |ξ|  ≤  10C and [formula] and set ηR = Rn + 1η(R  ·  ). Since [formula] is supported in a ball of radius 10R, we have [formula]. By [\eqref=convolution], we thus obtain

[formula]

By [\eqref=bil2] it follows that for 2  ≤  q  ≤  4,

[formula]

The terms [formula] and [formula] can be treated similarly. Since [formula], combining the estimates for these terms, we get

[formula]

Here   =  c + (n + 1). By this and [\eqref=local] it follows from [\eqref=qube] that for any ε > 0,

[formula]

Hence we have shown that [formula] implies [\eqref=imply]. If we have [\eqref=bi] for β  =  βi, then we see that [\eqref=bi] holds with

[formula]

by choosing [formula]. Iterating this implication we obtain a sequence {βi}∞i = 0. Note that the sequence {βi}∞i = 0 is strictly decreasing as long as -  n + 2α  /  q + 2βi  >  0 i.e. βi  >  n / 2  -  α / q. Since βi converges to (3n + 1 - 2α) / 8, we conclude that [\eqref=bi] holds for 2  ≤  q  ≤  4 and for any [formula]. This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thecone]: Rescaling

In this section we prove the following theorem by deducing linear estimate from the bilinear one [\eqref=bi].

Let [formula] and μ be an α-dimensional measure supported in [formula]. Then, for f supported in ΓR(1) there exists a constant C > 0 such that [\eqref=frac] holds for s satisfying

[formula]

For n = 3, this immediately implies Theorem [\ref=thecone].

It suffices to check that [formula] for 0  <  α  ≤  3. If 0 < α  ≤  1, it is easy to check [formula] for q  ≥  2. If 1 < α  ≤  3, we see that [formula] because (3n + 1 - 2α) / 8  =  (n + 2 - α) / 4 when n = 3. This completes the proof.

To prove Theorem [\ref=thecone1], we begin with a Whitney type decomposition to exploit bilinear estimate. (See [\cite=tvv] [\cite=w3].)

[formula]

Let D(R- 1 / 2) be a O(R- 1 / 2) neighborhood of D. Then [formula] can be covered by [formula] such that [formula] and 1  ≤  j  ≤   log R1 / 2. Also D(R- 1 / 2) is covered by a union of disjoint cubes [formula] of sidelength O(R- 1 / 2). So, [formula].

For f supported away from the origin we set

[formula]

Then by the above decomposition we have

[formula]

Note that the diameters of fjk and fjk' are O(2- j). In order to handle the first sum we need the following.

Let 1  ≤  j  ≤   log (R1 / 2). Suppose f and g are supported in ΓR(1) and the diameters of f and g  ≤  2- j - 2. If [formula] there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

where β  >  β(α,q) and

[formula]

By rotation we may assume that f and g are contained in O(2- j) neighborhood of [formula]. More precisely, we use the null coordinates

[formula]

Then the cone ΓR can be written as |ξ''|2 = 2στ. So

[formula]

Additionally, after a slight adjustment we may assume that [formula] and [formula], where

[formula]

Now, using an anisotropic transformation Tj:(ξ'',σ,τ)  ↦  (2jξ'',σ,22jτ), we have

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

So, we see

[formula]

and

[formula]

Clearly, μj is supported in [formula] because j  ≥  1, and note that f and g are supported in Γ2- 2jR(2- 2j) and satisfy the separation condition [\eqref=angular-separation] in Theorem [\ref=bifrac], by which we have that, for β  >  β(α,q),

[formula]

We now estimate 〈μj〉α. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

where R is a rectangle of dimensions [formula]. There are three different ways of decomposing R into cubes, namely, cubes of side length 2- 2jρ, 2- jρ, and ρ, respectively. Considering these three cases and using [\eqref=def-measure] for each case, we obtain

[formula]

Hence, [formula]. Combining this with [\eqref=scaled], [formula] and [formula] yields [\eqref=sep].

To handle the second sum in [\eqref=decomp], which is easier, we use the following.

Suppose that f is supported in ΓR(1) and the diameter of f is O(R- 1 / 2). For q  ≥  2, there exists a constant C > 0 such that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that f is supported in a rectangle R of dimensions [formula] for a positive constant C. We consider TR which takes the unit cube Q onto R. Then we have

[formula]

where [formula] is supported in the unit cube Q.

As before, let μR be the measure given by [formula] for continuous function φ. Since fR is supported in Q, [formula] for any Schwartz function ηQ satisfying ηQ = 1 on Q. Using Hausdorff-Young inequality, Lemma [\ref=fractal], and Hölder inequality we have, for q  ≥  2,

[formula]

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=rescaling] (this corresponds to the case [formula]), it is easy to see

[formula]

Therefore, combining these two estimates gives [\eqref=diagonaleq].

By [\eqref=decomp], we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=rescaling], for any ε > 0 and R > 1, we have

[formula]

Hence, by Schwarz inequality, we get

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=diagonal], we also see

[formula]

Combining these estimates, we obtain that for q  ≥  2, and for any ε > 0 and R > 1,

[formula]

where [formula]. Note that

[formula]

If 3  ≤  n  <  α, we can improve [formula] slightly. In fact, we use Plancherel theorem and Lemma [\ref=fractal] so that, for q  ≤  2, we have

[formula]

Since [formula] if 3  ≤  n  <  α  ≤  n + 1, it follows that, for n  <  α  ≤  n + 1

[formula]

This completes the proof.

We now show that if [\eqref=frac] holds for some s = s0, then [\eqref=fstrichartz] holds for s > s0. Since μ has compact support, by finite decomposition we may assume that μ is supported in [formula]. Recall that the solution u(x,t) is given by

[formula]

Let Pj be the projection operator Pj for [formula] given by (ξ)  =  β(|ξ|  /  2j)(ξ), where β is a [formula] function which is supported in

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:necessary]

Now, we obtain lower bounds on s for which [\eqref=frac] may hold. This is done by constructing suitable functions and measures.

Firstly we show that if [\eqref=frac] holds, then

[formula]

Let μ be the measure given by [formula] and f = χΓR(1). Then, μ is obviously α-dimensional and [formula] if |x|  ≤  cR- 1 with sufficiently small c > 0. Hence [\eqref=frac] implies [formula]. So, letting R  →    ∞   gives [\eqref=scaling].

We now show the second condition:

[formula]

Let us set

[formula]

Here [formula]. Then P is contained in ΓR(1). Let x = (x1,x'',xn + 1) be the dual variables of (η1,ξ'',ηn + 1), where [formula] and [formula].

For a given α let [formula] be a positive integer satisfying [formula]. We consider a measure μ defined by

[formula]

where δ is the 1-dimensional delta measure and [formula]. If n  <  α  ≤  n + 1, we set

[formula]

Then it is easy to see that μ is α-dimensional. In fact, considering the delta measure, [formula] for any ρ > 0 and [formula].

Let f  =  χP. Then we have [formula]. We denote by P* the dual rectangle of P of which dimensions are [formula] for some constant C. It follows that [formula] on a rectangle of which size is comparable to P*. Hence, [\eqref=frac] gives

[formula]

Letting R  →    ∞  , we obtain [\eqref=second_1] because

[formula]

Finally we show that [\eqref=frac] implies

[formula]

The condition [\eqref=third_1] can be obtained by an adaptation of the example in [\cite=er3] which was based on the one due to Wolff [\cite=w2].

First we show [\eqref=third_1] for 1  <  α  ≤  n. Let φP be a Schwartz function supported in P, where P is given by [\eqref=P]. Let N be an integer such that [formula], and let [formula] be the lattice points which are contained in Bn - 1(0,1) and separated by distance [formula]. Now we consider a Schwartz function F supported in ΓR(1), which is given by

[formula]

Here again, η1 and ηn + 1 are the coordinates defined as in the above. Note that [formula] is a sum of translations of [formula], i.e. [formula]. Since 1  <  α  ≤  n, we see [formula], which implies that P*  +  vk's are almost disjoint. By rapid decay of [formula] outside of P* we see that [formula] on [formula]. Consider the measure [formula] which is an α-dimensional measure with [formula] when 1 < α  ≤  n. In fact, for R- 1  ≤  ρ  <  R- 1 / 2 and [formula] it is easy to see

[formula]

The other cases ρ < R- 1, R- 1 / 2  <  ρ  ≤  1, and ρ > 1 can be treated similarly. Note that [formula] and [formula]. Hence [\eqref=frac] implies [formula], which gives [\eqref=third_1].

Now we proceed to show [\eqref=third_1] for α  >  n. Similarly as before, let [formula] be the lattice points which are contained in Bn - 1(0,1) and separated by about [formula] so that [formula]. Under the same assumption, let [formula] be the lattice points which are contained in ( - 1 / 100,1 / 100) and separated by [formula] such that [formula]. We set

[formula]

Hence it follows that [formula] on [formula]. We now consider an α-dimensional measure dμ = Rn + 1 - αχT  dx. Noting [formula] and [formula], we get the second condition in [\eqref=third_1] by letting R  →    ∞  .
