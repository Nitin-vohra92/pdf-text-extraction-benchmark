A note on FC-nilpotency

Introduction

A group in which every element has only finitely many conjugates is called a finite conjugacy group, FC-group for short. Of course, in particular all abelian groups and also all finite groups are FC-groups but there are many more non-trivial examples. The study of this class of groups was initiated by Baer [\cite=Baer] and Neumann [\cite=Neu], and its general theory was strongly developed during the second half of the last century, see [\cite=Tom].

Numerous variations of the notion of FC-group have been considered to study structural properties of infinite groups with some finiteness condition. As a strengthening, Neumann considered FC-groups with a uniform bound on the size of the conjugacy classes, known as bounded FC-groups, and showed that these are finite-by-abelian [\cite=Neu]. On the other hand, Haimo [\cite=Haimo] and later Duguid and Mclain [\cite=DM] analyzed FC-nilpotent and FC-solvable groups, which are natural generalizations of nilpotent and solvable groups respectively to the FC context. For instance, a group is FC-solvable of length n if it admits a finite chain of length n of normal subgroups whose factors are FC-groups. Similarly, one can define the notion of FC-nilpotent, see Definition [\ref=DefFCNil] for a precise definition. Furthermore, Hickin and Wenzel have shown in [\cite=HicWen] that, same as for normal nilpotent groups, the product of two normal FC-nilpotent subgroups is normal and again FC-nilpotent.

In this paper we aim to study a suitable version of bounded FC-nilpotency, see again Definition [\ref=DefFCNil], and to show that these groups are exactly the nilpotent-by-finite ones. This result generalizes the one of Neumann on bounded FC-groups. Our proof involves some machinery on FC-centralizers recently obtained by the first author in [\cite=Nadja] using techniques from model theory. Moreover, the result presented here generalizes some previous cases due to Wagner [\cite=Wagner] for groups in simple theories, as well as in [\cite=Nadja] for groups satisfying a uniform chain condition on centralizers up to bounded index.

Concerning the FC-solvable case, it is worth noticing that the situation is more straightforward and an easy argument is given at the end of the paper.

Bounded FC-nilpotent groups

We recall the definition of an FC-centralizer due to Haimo [\cite=Haimo] and related notions, which play an essential role along the paper.

A subgroup H of G is contained up to finite index in another subgroup K if [formula] has finite index in H. We denote this by [formula]. Then H and K are commensurable, denoted by H  ~  K, if [formula] and [formula].

Observe that [formula] is a transitive relation among subgroups of G, and that ~   is an equivalence relation.

Let G be a group and let K,H,N be subgroups of G with N normalized by H. The FC-centralizer of H modulo N in K is defined as

[formula]

If N is trivial it is omitted.

Observe that G is an FC-group if [formula]. As pointed out in the introduction a priori an FC-group may have arbitrarily large conjugacy classes. Those FC-groups in which there is a natural number bounding the size of any conjugacy class are called bounded FC-groups, and are precisely finite-by-abelian groups [\cite=Neu].

The following definition generalizes the notion of bounded FC-group to arbitrary FC-centralizers.

Let G be a group and let H,K,N be subgroups of G with K normalized by H. We say that [formula] is bounded if there exists a natural number n such that

[formula]

FC-centralizers for definable groups and bounded FC-centralizers have been carefully studied by the first author in [\cite=Nadja] who has shown that some behaviors of the ordinary centralizers can be generalized to FC-centralizers. This is exemplified in the following two lemmata which can be found as [\cite=Nadja] and [\cite=Nadja]. For the former we give a proof which is a simple adaption of the non-definable version to the bounded case.

Let H and K be two subgroups of a group G and N be a subgroup of G that is normalized by H and K. Assume further that the FC-centralizer of [formula] is bounded. If [formula], then [formula].

Proof. Let the natural number d be such that for any element h in [formula] we have that

[formula]

and suppose that K and [formula] are not commensurable. Now, choose elements [formula] in different cosets of [formula] in K. Thus, the index

[formula]

is finite.

Notice that the latter generalizes the aforementioned result due to Neumann on bounded FC-groups.

A group H is FC-nilpotent of class n if there exists a finite chain of normal subgroups

[formula]

such that Hi + 1 is contained in [formula]. We say that H is bounded FC-nilpotent if additionally each [formula] is bounded.

FC-nilpotent groups were introduced by Haimo [\cite=Haimo] who studied its basic properties. Duguid and McLain [\cite=DM] proved that finitely generated FC-nilpotent groups of class n are (nilpotent of class n)-by-finite.

A nilpotent-by-finite group is bounded FC-nilpotent.

Proof. Let N be a nilpotent group of class n and consider a finite extension H of N such that H / N has size k. Then, it is clear that Zi + 1(N) is contained in [formula] and that

[formula]

for any x∈Zi + 1(N). Hence

[formula]

witnesses that H is a bounded FC-nilpotent group.

The following result yields the equivalence between bounded FC-nilpotent groups and nilpotent-by-finite ones.

Any bounded FC-nilpotent group of class n is nilpotent (of class 2n)-by-finite.

Proof. Let N be a bounded FC-nilpotent group of class n, and let

[formula]

be a series witnessing this. Now, we find recursively on i  ≤  n a subgroup Fi of finite index in N and a finite chain

[formula]

of normal subgroups of Fi such that Hij + 1 / Hij is central in Fi / Hij for j < 2i and [formula] is contained in Hi2i. Once this process is concluded, the subgroup Fn is nilpotent of class at most 2n and has finite index in N.

We start the construction by setting H00  =  {1} and F0 = N. To continue, let i > 0 and assume that we have already defined [formula] and Fi - 1. Now, we work in the quotient N̄  =  Fi - 1  /  Hi - 12(i - 1) and consider the subgroup [formula]. As [formula] is contained in Hi - 12(i - 1) and [formula] is bounded, we have that [formula] and that it is bounded. Thus Fact [\ref=FactNadjaSym] yields that [formula]. Let N̄' be equal to [formula], a subgroup of has finite index in N̄, and let N̄i' be equal to [formula]. Now, as N̄i' has also finite index in N̄i, we clearly have that [formula] and moreover

[formula]

As the latter remains bounded, Fact [\ref=FactNadjaCom] yields that the group X defined as

[formula]

{1}=H ≤ H ≤ ≤ H

[formula]

Bounded FC-solvability

We say that a group is bounded FC-solvable of length n if it is an FC-solvable group of length n in which each factor witnessing the FC-solvability is a bounded FC-group. Thus, by Neumann's Theorem each of these factors is finite-by-abelian. Moreover, as any finite-by-abelian group has a characteristic subgroup of finite index which is nilpotent of class two, it then easily follows by induction on the FC-solvability length that a bounded FC-solvable group is solvable-by-finite. More precisely, if the series

[formula]

witnesses that G is a bounded FC-solvable group, then the group G / CG(G1') is FC-solvable of smaller length and hence solvable-by-finite. Whence G itself is solvable-by-finite since CG(G1') is nilpotent of class two.
