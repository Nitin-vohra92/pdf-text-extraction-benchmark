A geometrical view of modulation instability in optical fibers

Introduction

The phenomenon of modulation instability (MI) has been known and thoroughly studied for many years in a vast number of different areas of science. In the realm of optical fibers [\cite=Hasegawa.IEEEJournalQuantumElectronics.1980] [\cite=Anderson.OpticsLett.1984] [\cite=Tai.PRL.1986] [\cite=Potasek.OptLett.1987] [\cite=Potasek.PRA.1987] [\cite=Nakazawa.PhysRevA.1989] [\cite=Agrawal.IEEEPhotonicsTechnologyLett.1992], MI plays a fundamental role as it is intimately connected to the appearance of optical solitons, which have had a strong impact on applications to high-capacity fiber-optics communication. Modulation instability also is at the heart of the occurrence of efficient parametric optical processes heavily relied upon to achieve bright and coherent light in the infrared range. These very same nonlinear processes are used to provide optical amplification and wavelength conversion in the telecommunication band, maybe one day enabling complete photonic control of optical data traffic. In recent years, nonlinear phenomena such as supercontinuum generation [\cite=Demircan.OpticsComm.2005] [\cite=Frosz.OptExpress.2006] [\cite=Frosz.JOSAB.2006] [\cite=Dudley.OptExpress.2009] [\cite=Masip.OptLett.2009] and rogue waves [\cite=Hammani.IEEEPhotonics.2009] [\cite=Sorensen.JOSAB.2012] [\cite=Toenger.ScientificReports.2015] have rekindled the interest in MI.

Despite the abundant literature on the subject, to the best of our knowledge, a complete analysis of MI including both the delayed Raman response and the effect of self-steepening has only been presented by Béjot et al. [\cite=Bejot.PhysRevA.2011]. In this paper, we arrive at equivalent expressions for the MI gain by means of an alternative derivation of that in Ref. [\cite=Bejot.PhysRevA.2011], first presented in Ref. [\cite=Bonetti.PhysRevA.2016] where it was applied to the study of coherence in seeded MI, and turn our attention to the interplay between high-order dispersion and self-steepening. By analyzing the dependence of the MI gain with pump power in this complete model, we find that self-steepening yields an optimum power (in terms of maximizing the gain) and a cutoff power above which the MI gain essentially vanishes, leaving behind only the Raman contribution.

These observations regarding the power cutoff and the optimum power in the presence of self-steepening were first reported by Shukla and Rasmussen [\cite=Shukla.OptLett.1986], and the role of self-steepening was further analyzed by De Angelis et al. [\cite=DeAngelis.JOSAB.1996]. However, in both references the effects of high-order dispersion and delayed Raman response were not considered. In this work not only we extend these results, but put forth an analysis in the pump-power-versus-frequency plane, showing that the geometrical properties of the MI region are remarkably simple, thus providing a powerful tool for the analysis and synthesis of any arbitrary gain profile.

The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: In Section [\ref=sec:migain], we briefly present the derivation of an expression for the MI gain that contemplates all relevant nonlinear effects. Section [\ref=sec:geometry] is devoted to the description of the modulation instability gain in the pump-power-versus-frequency plane. Analytical expressions for finding gain maxima and the influence of high-order dispersion are presented in Section [\ref=sec:maxima]. Concluding remarks are presented in Section [\ref=sec:conclusions].

Analytical expression of the MI gain

Wave propagation in a lossless optical fiber can be described by the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation [\cite=Agrawal.NLFO.2012],

[formula]

where A(z,T) is the slowly-varying envelope, z is the spatial coordinate, and T is the time coordinate in a comoving frame at the group velocity (=  β- 11). [formula] and [formula] are operators related to the dispersion and nonlinearity, respectively, and are defined by The βm's are the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the propagation constant β(ω) around a central frequency ω0. In the convolution integral in the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:gnlse], R(T) is the response function that includes both the instantaneous (electronic) and delayed Raman response.

We analyze the effect of a small perturbation a to the stationary solution As of [\eqref=eq:gnlse] (see [\cite=Agrawal.NLFO.2012])

[formula]

If we keep only terms linear in the perturbation, after some manipulations, substitution of [\eqref=eq:perturbation] into [\eqref=eq:gnlse] leads to

[formula]

where Ω  =  ω  -  ω0, ã, [formula], γ̃, and [formula] are the Fourier transforms of a, β, γ and R, respectively. Moreover, for the sake of clarity we have defined

[formula]

After some straightforward algebra, [\eqref=eq:gnlseomegab] can be cast into a 2 order ordinary differential equation

[formula]

where

[formula]

with and γ̃e(Ω),  γ̃o(Ω), equivalently defined using the γn's for [formula].

Substitution of a(z,Ω)  =  D exp (iK(Ω)z) in [\eqref=eq:gnlseomegaq] leads to the dispersion relation

[formula]

Since in the vast majority of the literature only γ1 is taken into consideration, in the remaining of the paper we focus on a simple expression obtained by setting γn  =  0 for n  ≥  2 and [formula] (accounting for the effect of self-steepening). In this case,

[formula]

This expression agrees with a similar one presented in Ref. [\cite=Bejot.PhysRevA.2011] and with the one with [formula] in Ref. [\cite=Frosz.JOSAB.2006]. As usual, the MI gain can be found as

[formula]

where the factor 2 is due to the fact that g(Ω) is a power gain.

Geometry of the MI gain

Equations [\eqref=eq:reldispb]-[\eqref=eq:migaindef] exhibit some properties of the gain that have been thoroughly studied in the literature, for instance, the fact that it does not depend on odd terms of the dispersion relation (e.g., β3) [\cite=Potasek.OptLett.1987] [\cite=Frosz.JOSAB.2006]. However, the derived MI gain, including the effects of self-steepening and Raman delayed response, reveals novel aspects related to the self-steepening term [formula]. Indeed, it already has been noted that this term enables a gain even in a zero-dispersion fiber and that, in general, leads to a narrowing of the MI gain bandwidth [\cite=Abdullaev.OpticsComm.1994] [\cite=Abdullaev.JOSAB.1997]. These observations are revealed to be straightforward consequences of the analysis that follows.

It is widely known [\cite=Agrawal.NLFO.2012] that, for the simplified model that only takes β2 and γ0 into account and neglects self-steepening, as the pump power P0 increases the frequency [formula] where the MI gain attains its maximum, and the peak gain both increase as, respectively,

[formula]

Enter self-steepening and the relation between the pump power and the MI gain changes drastically in a non-trivial way, since there appears an optimum pump power level for which a peak gain is attained, and any further increase in pump power makes the MI gain decline. This relevant observation was first made by Shukla and Rasmussen [\cite=Shukla.OptLett.1986] with a simplified model of dispersion expanded up to the GVD parameter. In what follows, we find that this feature is retained when considering an arbitrary number of dispersion terms. Moreover, we show this to be a corollary of the geometrical properties of the region where MI gain occurs, as defined over the pump-power-versus-frequency plane.

To this purpose, let us analyze the case of Eq. [\eqref=eq:reldispb] where only the electronic Raman response is taken into account (i.e., (Ω) = 1). With the help of some examples (viz. Fig. [\ref=fig:2_2]), we may show that, in many cases, this simplification is not too restrictive. Thus, under this setting,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since there is MI gain if, and only if, Δ(Ω,P0)  >  0, we may define the MI gain region in the Ω - P0 plane as

[formula]

Notice that for [formula], we get the usual textbook expression [\cite=Agrawal.NLFO.2012]

[formula]

though we are interested in the case where self-steepening is not neglected, i.e., [formula]. Here, Δ(Ω,P0)  =  0 defines the boundary of [formula] and is either met when Ω  =  0 or whenever P0 is

[formula]

where

[formula]

Since for each fixed frequency ∂2P0Δ(Ω,P0)  <  0 , it is clear that Δ(Ω,P0) can only be positive between P- and P+ when [formula]. It is common practice to use the approximation [formula] [\cite=Agrawal.NLFO.2012]. In this case, Eq. [\eqref=eq:MI_reg_lims] limits the frequency to lie in the region Ω∈( - ω0,ω0). Given that frequencies Ω <  - ω0 have no physical meaning, no serious limitation is imposed in the red-end of the spectrum. Assuming [formula] corresponds to neglecting the frequency dependence of the fiber mode effective area [\cite=Blow.IEEEQuantumElectronics.1989]. As it is argued in Ref. [\cite=Kibler.ApplPhysB.2005], the correction due to that dependence leads to a slightly increased value of [formula] and, hence, a further limitation of range of frequencies where there is MI gain.

From Eqs. [\eqref=eq:MIreg]-[\eqref=eq:Pmax], we can write

[formula]

The [formula] of Eq. [\eqref=eq:MI_reg_ss] has a direct geometrical interpretation: since [formula] define an ellipse centered at (0,1) with vertical axis of length 2 and horizontal axis of length 2ω0, the MI gain region is given by the portion that lies above the P0 = 0 axis of the aforementioned ellipse bent and stretched along the vertical axis by [formula]. To see this, in Fig. [\ref=fig:MI_reg] we plot the MI gain regions in a plane of normalized power ([formula]) versus frequency (Ω) for (Ω) = (β2 / 2)Ω2 + (β4 / 4!)Ω4 with [formula], β4 taking on the values -0.8, 0, +0.8 ×   10 ps/km, and [formula] with a pump centered at a wavelength of 5 m. Self-steepening is considered by setting [formula]. The curves (Ω) / Ω2 are also plotted as a reference.

With this interpretation in mind we can explain, for instance, the non-trivial behavior of the power cutoff above which MI gain nearly vanishes (but for the vestigial contribution due to the delayed Raman response). Figure [\ref=fig:2_2] shows the MI gain in the Ω-P0 plane using the same parameters of Fig. [\ref=fig:MI_reg] but for β4 = -1.6, -0.8, +0.8, +1.6 ×   10 ps/km and with the addition of the delayed Raman response to show its negligible contribution to the shape of the MI gain region. Typical values were chosen, then R(T)  =  (1 - fR)δ(T) + fRhR(T), with

[formula]

where u(T) is the Heaviside step function, fR  =  0.031, [formula], [formula] [\cite=Karim.OptExpress.2015].

To see what happens with the power cutoff, Fig. [\ref=fig:2_3] shows the pump power above which MI gain nearly vanishes as a function of β4 for 20 different values ranging from -1.6 to +1.6 ×   10 ps/km (the β4's of Fig. [\ref=fig:2_2] are marked in red dots.) As it is readily seen, the cutoff power varies linearly with β4 for β4  <  0 and exhibits a plateau when β4 contributes towards the normal dispersion regime (that is, β4  >  0).

To explain the plateau, note that whenever β4 is positive, the ellipse 'bends down' and therefore the power cutoff remains constant and equal to [formula] (i.e., P+ for Ω  →  0). When β4 is negative, if |β4| is not too small, the cutoff power (upper limit of the region along the vertical axis) lies near the position of the maxima of -  (Ω) / Ω2, and it is easily seen that these maxima vary linearly with β4, explaining the approximately linear behavior seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:2_3] for negative β4's.

All in all, the most obvious and important property that can be exploited from the geometrical description of the MI region is that, since the horizontal axis of the ellipse bends with -  (Ω) / Ω2, one is able to synthesize different MI gain regions by the arbitrary design of the dispersion profiles of the waveguide in a straightforward manner.

Location of the MI gain maxima

We may ask for the location of maxima within the MI gain region as it is paramount to applications which rely upon MI, such as supercontinuum generation from continuous-wave (CW) lasers and parametric amplification in nonlinear media. In order to do so, we find that

[formula]

Since ∂2P0 is negative definite for Ω  ≠  0, by finding zeroes of Eq. [\eqref=eq:derP0] any maximum inside the MI gain region must have [formula]. That is, maxima of the modulation instability gain must lie on the lines drawn in Fig. [\ref=fig:MI_reg].

We may find the location of the maxima by differentiating Δ(Ω,P0) with respect to Ω and proceeding with the usual techniques in calculus courses. However, a more intuitive understanding can be reached by defining

[formula]

for (Ω)  <  0. It is easy to see that maxima of g(Ω,P0) must also be maxima of ĝ(Ω). By using Eq. [\eqref=eq:gmax_W] it can be easily shown that the location of maxima is [formula] and [formula] for the simple case where only GVD is considered. That is, a peak MI gain right in the middle of the power range for which there is gain. This observation was first reported by Shukla and Rasmuseen [\cite=Shukla.OptLett.1986]. However, the analysis in Ref. [\cite=Shukla.OptLett.1986], did not include higher-order dispersion terms. Thus, if we turn our attention to the influence of these terms, finding the MI gain maxima and their location in the Ω-P0 plane, which amounts to a simple calculus problem by means of ∂Ωĝ and ∂2Ωĝ, gives us results, which depend parametrically on the dispersion coefficients, that render the analysis (and synthesis) of the extrema a straightforward numerical task.

As a simple example, we may consider analyzing the influence of β4 in MI gain maxima. If we define ĝβ2(Ω) to be that of Eq. [\eqref=eq:gmax_W] when only GVD is considered, we have that given that (Ω) < 0, βn  =  0 for n  ≥  6, where [formula] are the arguments that maximize ĝ(Ω). In general, [formula] depends on the particular dispersion profile, but it can be shown that for |β4| large enough [formula] remains nearly constant, and [formula] also varies little. In practical terms, this means that the gain increase over [formula] is proportional to |β4|, thus showing the strong influence of high-order dispersion (see top left and top right panes of Fig. [\ref=fig:2_2] and note the different scales.)

Conclusions

In conclusion, we presented a simple geometrical description of a full model of modulation instability in optical fibers. This novel approach allowed us to relate the MI gain profile to any arbitrary dispersion of the waveguide and provided a straightforward explanation of the dependence of the cutoff power with high-order dispersion. Further we showed that the power level maximizing the MI gain is greatly influenced by high-order dispersion and that it can be explicitly obtained. Finally, the geometrical model can turn into a powerful tool to synthesize a desired MI gain profile by appropriate waveguide design, with the potential application to the design of a number of parametric-amplification and supercontinuum-generation devices that rely on a precise knowledge of MI dynamics.
