Rate of Convergence of Major Cost Incurred in the In-Situ Permutation Algorithm

Introduction

The in-situ permutation algorithm developed by MacLeod [\cite=MacLeod] replaces [formula] by [formula] where [formula] is a permutation of [formula] using at most O(1) space. Kirshenhofer, Prodinger and Tichy [\cite=prodinger] have shown that assuming the input comes from a sequence of independently and identically distributed random variables with a common continuous distribution, the major cost measures, say Xn, incurred in the algorithm, can be described by X0 = 0, and for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

where (Xn),(X*n), (In) are independent, [formula], and In is uniformly distributed over [formula]. Here the symbol [formula] denotes equivalence in distribution.

The mean and variance of Xn were calculated by Knuth [\cite=knuth] which satisfy

[formula]

where γ denotes Euler's constant and [formula].

Further, Hwang [\cite=hwang] showed using Rösler's contraction method that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes convergence in distribution. Here Y satisfies

[formula]

where [formula], U is the uniform random variable over the unit interval, Y,Y*, and U are independent, and C(u): = (1 - u) ln (1 - u) + u ln (u) + u.

We wish to estimate the rate of convergence Yn  →  Y following Neininger and Rüschendorf [\cite=naini]. The basic distance considered in [\cite=naini] is the Zolotarev metric ζ3 which given distributions L(V),L(W) is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the space of all twice differentiable functions with second derivative being Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant 1. Hereon we use the notation ζ3(V,W): = ζ3(L(V),L(W)). It is known that convergence in ζ3 implies weak convergence and that ζ3(V,W) <   ∞   if V = W, V2  =  W2, and ||V||3,||W||3  <    ∞  . The metric ζ3 is ideal of order 3, that is, we have for T independent of (V,W) and c  ≠  0

[formula]

We wish to obtain following

The major cost (Xn) incurred in the in-situ permutation algorithm satisfying recurrence [\eqref=eq1] satisfies

[formula]

where X: = Y / σ is a scaled version of the limiting distribution in [\eqref=eq2].

We modify the proof in [\cite=naini] suited for the above case in the next section.

Notation: Subsequently, we use that [formula], ||Y||3  <    ∞   where ||Y||p: = (|Y|p)1 / p, 1  ≤  p <   ∞   denotes the Lp-norm.

The Proof

We start with the following lemma from [\cite=naini].

Let V,W have identical first and second moment with ||V||3,||W||3  <    ∞  , then

[formula]

where

[formula]

The constants σ(n)  ≥  0 are defined by

[formula]

Lower Bound: Establishing the lower bounds only requires information of moments of (Xn). Using the bound in lemma [\ref=lemma1], we have

[formula]

Observe that the third moment of Yn is

[formula]

with M3  =  (Y3) > 0 where we use the expansion of third cumulant κ3(Xn) of Xn which can be explicitly computed using generating functions for factorial moments with aid of Maple in [\cite=prodinger]. The equation [\eqref=eq5] gives us

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

which proves the claimed lower bound in the theorem.

Upper Bound: The variates Yn would satisfy the recurrence:

[formula]

where (Yn),(Yn'),In are independent, [formula] for all k  ≥  0 and [formula], with μ(n): = (Xn), n  ≥  0. The rest of the proof follows identically as in the upper bound proof in [\cite=naini].
