Introduction

[\citet=L07] and [\citet=T13] have estimated that fast radio bursts radiate as much as 1040 ergs and set lower bounds on their radiated power as high as 1043 ergs/s (because only upper bounds on their intrinsic durations have been measured, their instantaneous power can only be bounded from below). These values are derived from their observed fluences and the assumptions of cosmological distances and (at least roughly) isotropic emission. Distances are estimated by attributing FRB dispersions to intergalactic plasma in standard cosmology. The inferred brightness temperatures are nearly as high as the highest astronomical brightness temperatures ever measured, those of the nanoshots of two Galactic pulsars [\citep=S04] [\citep=HE07].

The evidence for cosmological distances is compelling [\citep=K16a] [\citep=K16b], but the assumption of isotropic emission has only simplicity and the lack of contrary evidence to support it. The high powers it implies pose demanding constraints [\citet=K16a] on models [\citep=K12] [\citep=CW15] [\citep=CSP15] [\citep=LBP16] [\citep=K16b] that attribute FRB to supergiant pulses from neutron stars with physical processes like those of radio pulsars. These models would otherwise be attractive because they would naturally explain (assuming similar physical processes, that unfortunately are not understood) the coherent emission with extraordinary brightness temperatures of FRB. These high brightness temperatures also impose demanding constraints on models [\citep=K14] [\citep=RVV16] of the emission mechanisms themselves.

In this paper I consider a hypothesis opposite to that of isotropic emission. Suppose FRB radiate a steady power, but concentrate it into a beam of solid angle Ω that sweeps or wanders in direction, and only intercepts the observer a fraction D of the time, where D is the empirical duty factor. D may be roughly considered the fraction of the time the FRB is "on", and is more formally defined as

[formula]

where F(t) is the observed flux (or spectral density). The duty factors of several non-repeating FRB are roughly estimated [formula] [\cite=K16b], but the repeating FRB 121102 [\citep=S16a] [\citep=S16b] has D as large as ~  10- 5.

If the emission is steady and if the direction of emission is randomly and statistically isotropically distributed on the sky, the emission must be collimated into a solid angle

[formula]

The instantaneous power is less by a factor D than it would be if isotropic emission were assumed, but the brightness temperature, inferred from the measured flux density, the distance and the source size, is the same. The requirement of coherent emission is not relaxed, but the energetic constraints are mitigated.

Energetic Constraints on Pulsar Parameters

Constraints

I follow the analysis of [\citet=K16a], but assume steady emission collimated into the solid angle Ω. The most luminous FRB radiated a power [\citep=T13]

[formula]

into a solid angle Ω  ~  4πD in a pulse of equivalent isotropic energy 1040E40 ergs with a (not measured) unbroadened duration 10- 3Δt- 3 s and duty factor [formula]. D is crudely bounded from limits on repetition of FRB other than the known repeater FRB 121102 [\citep=K16b]. FRB 121102 has a larger D  ~  10- 5 but its outbursts were much fainter than the most intense bursts reported by [\citet=T13], so the inferred mean P is similar.

The power that can be emitted by a magnetic dipole rotating at an angular frequency ω  =  104ω4 s- 1, assuming the dipole axis is perpendicular to the spin axis, is

[formula]

where ε  ≤  1 is an unknown efficiency of conversion of spin energy into radio-frequency energy. The magnetic dipole moment

[formula]

where B  =  1015B15 gauss is the equatorial dipole field.

Combining Eqs. [\ref=power]-[\ref=moment] yields

[formula]

where [formula] and τ  =  105τ5  s is the mean interval between bursts. D is the duty factor describing the actual burst duration at the source; the measured duration may be longer because of instrumental response and propagation broadening.

Using the empirical lower bound of [formula]s on the spindown time of FRB 121102 (recognizing that this may not be applicable to other, more luminous, FRB) yields

[formula]

These constraints are illustrated in Fig. [\ref=constraints].

Combining Eqs. [\ref=dipoleparams] and [\ref=spindown] yields an upper bound on the spin period, corresponding to the lower bound on ω4 of the allowed region in Fig. [\ref=constraints]

[formula]

For beamed emission with D  =  10- 8 periods as long as 100 s may bei allowed, provided the magnetic field is large enough and depending on values of the other parameters, but for isotropic emission [formula]s.

Comparison to known pulsars

Even if FRB are produced by objects like radio pulsars (non-accreting magnetic neutron stars), it is implausible that FRB parameters are in the range of those of known Galactic radio pulsars that do not make FRB (or do so too rarely to have been observed). However, comparing known pulsar parameters to the constraints on FRB pulsar parameters may give some insight into what Nature may provide the modeler.

Catalogued pulsars [\citep=ATNF] have values of B215ω44 in the range 1.3  ×  10- 22-2  ×  10- 12. Many pulsars would satisfy inequalities ([\ref=dipoleparams]) and ([\ref=spin]) if the product of the dimensionless parameters were very roughly O(1), but all would fail by several orders of magnitude for isotropic emission.

Values of ε, tacitly assuming isotropic emission, in the range 3  ×  10- 2-2  ×  10- 11 are found in the ATNF Pulsar Catalogue [\citep=ATNF], if the luminosity is evaluated at 400 MHz with an assumed bandwidth of 400 MHz and is averaged over the pulse cycle. The value of ε corresponding to the peak of the pulse is likely to be an order of magnitude higher. However, these results cannot be directly applied to the steady-source model of FRB because that model requires a narrowly collimated beam.

Nanoshots

The peak nanoshot luminosities of PSR B1937+21 [\citep=S04] and of the Crab pulsar [\citep=HE07], assuming isotropic emission, roughly equal their spindown powers. This would imply ε  ≈  1, but the assumption of isotropic emission would make that value of ε inapplicable to steady-source (beamed) models of FRB.

[\citet=S04], assuming isotropic emission, inferred a radiation energy density in the nanoshots of PSR B1937+21 that exceeded (if they were emitted from a region of dimension ~  (cΔt)  ~  500  cm) the plasma energy density by a factor of ~  300, and that was even greater than the magnetostatic energy density. This is implausible: a pulsar can radiate its rotational energy only at the dipole radiation rate and the radiation Poynting vector is distributed over the open field lines. They cover a fraction O(ωR / c)  ~  O(0.1)  ~  1012  cm2 of the surface of a fast pulsar (P  =  1.557  ms) like B1937+21, so that only [formula] of the spindown power flows through the apparent ~  500  cm source region (Δt  ≈  15  ns) of the nanoshot. The spindown power flowing through the apparent source region is several orders of magnitude less than the inferred (isotropic) radiated power.

It is implausible that a nanoshot could be powered by the neutron star's magnetic energy because this can only be tapped by magnetic reconnection. This occurs in young high field neutron stars ("magnetars") and is observed as Soft Gamma Repeaters and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars. These emit thermal X-rays at temperatures of tens of keV, unlike the coherent radio emission of nanoshots or FRB.

A plausible resolution of this energy dilemma is that the nanoshots are highly collimated, reducing the radiation energy density, perhaps by many orders of magnitude, compared to that implied by isotropic emission. They may be Galactic exemplars of the highly collimated pulsar emission that this paper hypothesizes for FRB, though FRB are ~  1013 times as energetic as the nanoshots (that have ~  0.1 of the fluence of FRB and are ~  10- 6 times as distant). Despite this enormous difference of energy scale, the brightness temperatures of nanoshots and FRB are within about two orders of magnitude of each other, suggesting a similarity.

Collimated Radiation

In Nature, collimated radiation is only produced by collimated beams of relativistic particles. Radiation is generally broadly distributed in angle (for example, in a dipole radiation pattern) in the instantaneous rest frames of the emitting particles, and Lorentz transformation to the observer's frame collimates it to an angle θ  ~  1 / Γ, where Γ is the emitters' Lorentz factor. In the laboratory collimated radiation is produced by engineered structures (laser cavity mirrors, lenses, absorbing collimators etc.), but these are not likely to occur naturally. Intensity spikes may occur at caustics, but in propagation through turbulent media many individual ray paths add randomly and the intensity has a Rayleigh distribution. Intensities orders of magnitude greater than the mean are exponentially rare.

Collimation to a fraction D of the sphere indicates emission by relativistic particles with Lorentz factors Γ  ~  1 / (4πD) if the particles (and radiation) are confined to a thin but broad sheet (such as a surface of constant magnetic latitude; such structures are observed in auroræ) and Lorentz factors [formula] if the particles and radiation form a pencil beam. The observed duty factors of FRB suggest Γ  ~  105-108 for sheeds and Γ  ~  300-104 for pencil beams.

Detecting Periodicity

If repeating FRB can be shown to be periodically modulated their production by rotating neutron stars will be demonstrated. The values of the period and its rate of change will distinguish pulsar from SGR models and determine their parameters. Phasing the bursts of repeating FRB may detect periodicity provided their emission is modulated by their rotation as well as by the wandering that produces rare and sporadic bursts when the assumed narrow beam points in our direction. Such periodic modulation is certainly plausible (it is the characteristic signature of classic radio pulsars), but by no means certain. It might manifest itself in a periodogram of the epochs of observed bursts.

Suppose we observe N bursts from a FRB in a time Tobs and wish to search for modulation frequencies over a bandwidth ν (typically from 0 to ν). If all pulses are equally strong (deviations from this will reduce the effective value of N) and all observable pulses occur at the same rotational phase of the pulsar then the effective number of independent samples (independent elements of a periodogram) is about 2νTobs. If the observed pulse times are distributed as shot noise (the null hypothesis of no periodic modulation) then the elements of the periodogram have a Gaussian distribution (if N  ≫  1) with mean μ  =  0 and standard deviation [formula]. If the pulses are exactly periodic the value of the element of the periodogram corresponding to that period is N. In order to have a probability p  ≪  1 of a false positive period, N must satisfy

[formula]

For an observing run with Tobs  =  2  ×  104  s (about 6 hours), ν  =  1000 / s and p  =  0.003 (3σ detection) N  >  24 is required. For p  =  3  ×  10- 7 (5σ detection) N  >  32 is required. These values are about an order of magnitude greater than those detected by [\citet=S16b] and [\citet=S16a] in their studies of the repeating FRB 121102, but small enough that it is plausible that sufficiently many pulses will be observed in the future, perhaps by FAST or SKA, more sensitive than any existing instruments.

These estimates assume a constant pulse period, a good approximation for Tobs  ≪  1  day, even for rapidly slowing pulsars. However, for data scattered over many days it may be necessary to allow for spin-down [formula], and perhaps even higher derivatives; the phase

[formula]

This increases the dimensionality of the parameter space to be searched and the required number of detected pulses increases rapidly. Timing noise can make it impossible to detect underlying periodicity because then the series [\ref=phase] does not converge. This may occur when the detected signal consists, as for FRB and RRAT, of rare but accurately timed pulses rather than, as for most radio pulsars, a continuously modulated periodic signal.

Discussion

The assumption that FRB emit roughly isotropically with a very low duty factor represents one end of a continuum. In rotation-powered pulsars there is no energy reservoir intermediate between the neutron star's rotation and the radiation field, so these assumptions combine to impose extreme constraints [\citep=K16a] on pulsar parameters. This paper has explored the opposite limit, in which FRB emit steadily in a narrow beam that only rarely points to the observer. It is not possible to distinguish these limits phenomenologically, but the assumption of steady collimated emission relaxes the constraints on the pulsar parameters, and is therefore attractive theoretically. The truth may lie somewhere between these extremes.

If there were a complete model of coherent emission in FRB it would be required to explain their high brightness. In the absence of such a model I abdicate this responsibility, and only consider the easier problem of energetic constraints. This might be excused by comparison with classic radio pulsars: The origin of their energy in spindown of rotating neutron stars is understood, but their coherent emission is not, despite a half-century of effort.
