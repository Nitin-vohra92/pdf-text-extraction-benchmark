The countable type properties in free paratopological groups

Introduction

All spaces are T0 unless stated otherwise. We denote by [formula] the set of all natural numbers, [formula] the set of integer and ω the first countable order. The letter e denotes the neutral element of a group. For a space X, we always denote the set of all isolated points of X by [formula]. Readers may consult [\cite=AT2008] [\cite=E1989] [\cite=Gr1984] for notations and terminology not explicitly given here.

The subsequent work in this paper is at least in part provoked by the desire to understand more fully the inter-relationship between the algebraic and topological conditions imposed in such celebrated theorems about topological groups as the following:

[\cite=PO1973] Each T0 topological group is Tychonoff.

[\cite=BG1936] [\cite=KS1936] Each first-countable topological group is metrizable

[\cite=RW1981] A topological group G is a paracompact p-space if and only if there exists a compact subset that is of countable character in G.

[\cite=Ar1981] A topological group G is of countable pseudocharacter if and only if it is submetrizable.

A paratopological group G is a group G with a topology such that the product map of G  ×  G into G is continuous. If G is a paratopological group and the inverse operation of G is continuous, then G is called a topological group. However, there exists a paratopological group which is not a topological group; Sorgenfrey line ([\cite=E1989]) is such an example. Paratopological groups were discussed and many results have been obtained in [\cite=AR2005] [\cite=AT2008] [\cite=EN2012] [\cite=EN2013] [\cite=Lin] [\cite=LFC2012] [\cite=Lin2012] [\cite=LC] [\cite=LC1] [\cite=LL2010] [\cite=PN2006] [\cite=RS].

[\cite=RS] Let X be a subspace of a paratopological group G. Assume that

The set X generates G algebraically, that is 〈X〉 = G;

Each continuous mapping f:X  →  H to a paratopological group H extends to a continuous homomorphism :G  →  H.

Then G is called the Markov free paratopological group on X and is denoted by FP(X).

Again, if all the groups in the above definitions are Abelian, then we get the definition of the Markov free Abelian paratopological group on X which is denoted by AP(X).

Finally, we recall and introduce some concepts.

Let X be a space. Then

X is of countable type [\cite=E1989] if every compact subspace F of X is contained in a compact subspace K that is of countable character in X;

X is of pointwise countable type [\cite=E1989] if every point of X is contained in a compact subspace K that is of countable character in X;

X is of subcountable type [\cite=VA1970] if every compact subspace F of X is contained in a compact Gδ-subspace K of X;

X is of pointwise subcountable type [\cite=VA1970] if every point of X is contained in a compact Gδ-subspace K of X;

X is called almost countable type if it contains a non-empty compact set K that is of countable character in X;

X is called almost subcountable type if it contains a non-empty compact set K that is a Gδ-set in X.

It is easy to see that

Note (1) In general, a space is of subcountable type need not be of countable type. For example, every space with a countable network is of subcountable type, but it need not be of countable type (take a countable dense subspace of Dω1).

(2) There exists a pointwise countable type space X which is not of countable type, see [\cite=VA1970].

(3) There exists a pointwise subcountable type space X which is not of pointwise countable type, see Example [\ref=e0].

(4) There exists an almost subcountable type space X which is not of almost countable type, see Example [\ref=e1].

(5) There exists an almost subcountable type space X which is not of pointwise subcountable type, see Example [\ref=e2].

(6) There exists a pointwise subcountable type space X which is not of subcountable type, see [\cite=VA1970].

(7) In [\cite=VA1970], pointwise subcountable type and subcountable type are named pseudopoint-countable type and pseudocountable type, respectively.

Some properties of almost countable type spaces or almost subcountable type spaces

The following proposition is easy to check.

The product [formula] of countably many almost countable type spaces (resp. almost subcountable type spaces) is of almost countable type (resp. almost subcountable type).

Let X,Y be two spaces. The mapping f:X  →  Y is perfect if f is a closed continuous mapping and f- 1(y) is compact for each y∈Y.

If f:X  →  Y is a perfect mapping from a space X onto an almost countable type space (resp. an almost subcountable type space) Y, then X is of almost countable type (resp. almost subcountable type).

Since Y is of almost countable type, there exist a compact subset K in Y and a sequence of open neighborhoods [formula] that is a neighborhood base for Y at K. Then f- 1(K) is compact in X since f is a perfect mapping [\cite=E1989]. We claim that [formula] is a neighborhood base for X at f- 1(K). Indeed, let U be an arbitrary open neighborhood of f- 1(K) in X. For each y∈K, since f is a closed mapping, there exists an open neighborhood Wy of y in Y such that f- 1(Wy)  ⊂  U. Then the family {Wy:y∈K} covers K, and hence there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

Obviously, if Y is of almost subcountable type, then so X is .

There exists a pointwise subcountable type space G which is not of pointwise countable type.

Let X be a non-discrete and non-compact metrizable space. Then the free topological group G = F(X) is submetrizable [\cite=AT2008], hence it is of pointwise subcountable type. We claim that G is not of pointwise countable type. Suppose not, it follows from [\cite=T2003] that X is compact or discrete, which is a contradiction.

There exists an almost subcountable type paratopological group G which is not of almost countable type.

Let X be a Tychonoff submetrizable non-discrete space. Then the free paratopological group G = FP(X) over X is submetrizable [\cite=PN2006], and hence it is of almost subcountable type. It follows from Theorem [\ref=t2] that FP(X) is not of almost countable type.

A space is a functionally Hausdorff space if for two arbitrary distinct points x and y there is a continuous real-valued mapping f on X such that f(x)  ≠  f(y).

There exists an almost subcountable type space G which is not of pointwise subcountable type.

Let X be a functionally Hausdorff space with uncountable pseudocharacter. It follows from Theorem [\ref=t3] that AP(X) is not of almost subcountable type. Let G be the topological sum of AP(X) and a discrete space Y, where [formula]. Then G is of almost subcountable type. However, it is obvious that G is not of pointwise subcountable type.

Some properties of almost countable type paratopological groups

Firstly, we show that the properties of countable type, pointwise countable type and almost countable type are consistent in the class of paratopological groups.

In a topological group, the property of almost countable type is equivalent to the well known condition of almost metrizability. Therefore, it is interesting to consider the property of almost countable type in paratopological groups. Indeed, we have the following proposition.

Let G be a paratopological group. Then G is of almost countable type if and only if it is of countable type.

Obviously, it suffices to show that each almost countable type paratopological group is of countable type. Since G is of almost countable type, there exist a compact subset K and a sequence of open subsets [formula] such that [formula] is a base for G at K. Without loss of generality, we may assume that e∈K. Let L be an arbitrary compact subset of G. Put F = LK. Clearly, F is compact since G is a paratopological group. Then the family [formula] is a base for G at F. Indeed, take an arbitrary open neighborhood O of F in G. By [\cite=AT2008], there exists an open neighborhood V of the neutral element e in G such that LKV = FV  ⊂  O. Then KV is an open neighborhood of K, and therefore there exists [formula] such that K  ⊂  Un  ⊂  KV, then LK  ⊂  LUn  ⊂  LKV  ⊂  O. Therefore, G is of countable type.

Suppose that H is a closed subgroup of an almost countable type paratopological group G. Then the quotient space G / H is of almost countable type.

Let π:G  →  G / H be the quotient mapping. Obviously, π is open. Since G is of almost countable type, it contains a non-empty compact set K which has a neighborhood base [formula] in G. Then [formula] is a neighborhood base for G / H at the compact set π(K), so G / H is of almost countable type.

Let G be a Hausdorff paratopological group that is of almost countable type, and let O be a neighborhood of the neutral element in G. Then there exists a compact subgroup H  ⊂  O such that H is of countable character in G.

Since paratopological group G is of almost countable type, there exists a non-empty compact set K that is of countable character in G. By the homogeneity of G, we may assume that K contains the neutral element e of G. Let [formula] be a neighborhood base for G at K. By induction, we can define a sequence [formula] of open neighborhoods of e in G satisfying the following conditions:

(i) V1  ⊂  O;

(ii)[formula] for each [formula];

(iii) [formula] for each [formula] (This is possible since K is Hausdorff and compact.).

Put [formula]. It is obvious that H  ⊂  O. Finally, we shall show that H is a compact subgroup in G such that it is of countable character in G.

Since [formula] for each [formula], H is a semigroup and H  ⊂  K. Note that

[formula]

Thus H is closed, so H is compact.

A non-empty subset M of H is called a right ideal in H if MH  ⊂  M. Since H is a compact semigroup of G, it contains a minimal closed right ideal, say L (apply the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma to the family of all closed right ideals in K by ordered by inverse inclusion). For each x∈L, it is easy to see that xL  ⊂  LH  ⊂  L, and thus xLH  ⊂  x(LH)  ⊂  xL, i.e., xL is a right ideal in H. Since xL is closed in H, xL  ⊂  L and L is a minimal closed right ideal in H, we have xL = L for each x∈L. In particular, we have x2L = L for each x∈L, whence it follows that x2y = x for some y∈L and thus x- 1 = y∈L. Therefore, we conclude that e∈L, H = L, and that H is a subgroup of G.

Then it is obvious that compact subgroup H has countable pseudocharacter in G and in K. Since K is compact, we conclude that χ(H,K)  ≤  ω. Then it follows from [\cite=E1989] that χ(H,G)  ≤  χ(H,K)  ·  χ(K,G). Therefore, compact subgroup H is of countable character in G.

Similarly, we can show the following proposition.

Let G be a Hausdorff paratopological group that is of almost subcountable type, and let O be a neighborhood of the neutral element in G. Then there exists a compact subgroup H  ⊂  O that is of countable pseudocharacter in G.

Let G be a Hausdorff paratopological group that is of almost countable type, and let [formula] be the family of all compact subgroups of G which are of countable character in G. For each [formula], let πH:G  →  G / H be the quotient mapping onto the left coset space G / H. Let

[formula]

Then [formula] is a base of G.

Obviously, the family [formula] is closed under taking left and right translates in G. Hence it suffices to show that the subfamily

[formula]

is a base for G at the neutral element e. Let W be a neighborhood of e in G. Find a neighborhood O of e such that O2  ⊂  W. It follows from Proposition [\ref=p3] that there exists a compact subgroup H of G such that [formula] and H  ⊂  O. Let V = πH(O). Since π- 1H(V) = π- 1HπH(O) = OH, the set V is open in G / H. Moreover, we have [formula] and OH  ⊂  O2  ⊂  W.

Let G be a paratopological group. If H is a compact subgroup of G and P is a closed subset of G, then the sets HP and PH are closed in G.

We will prove that HP is closed in G. The case of PH differs only in trivial details. Take an arbitrary point [formula]. Obviously, H- 1a is compact since H is a group, and the sets H- 1a and P are disjoint. Then it follows from [\cite=AT2008] that there exists an open neighborhood U of e such that H- 1aU and P are disjoint. Then it is easy to see that [formula]. Since aU is an open neighborhood of a, the point a is not in the closure of HP. Hence HP is closed.

By Proposition [\ref=p3] and Theorem [\ref=t0], one can easily obtain the following two theorems.

Let G be a paratopological group. If H is a compact subgroup in G, then the quotient mapping π of G onto the quotient space G / H is perfect.

Let G be a Hausdorff paratopological group that is of almost countable type. Then there exists a compact subgroup H that is of countable character in G such that the quotient mapping π of G onto the quotient space G / H is perfect.

Let G be a paratopological group. If H is a compact subgroup that is of countable character in G, then G / H is first-countable.

By the homogeneity of G, it suffices to show that the neutral element of G / H is of countable character in G / H. Let [formula] be a neighborhood base for G at H. Since the quotient mapping π:G  →  G / H is open, each π(Un) is an open neighborhood of the neutral element of G / H. Let W be an open neighborhood of the neutral element of G / H. Then π- 1(W) is an open neighborhood at H in G, hence there exists [formula] such that Un  ⊂  π- 1(W), so π(Un)  ⊂  W. Therefore, the family [formula] is a neighborhood base for G / H at the neutral element. Hence G / H is first-countable.

A Hausdorff paratopological group G is of almost countable type if and only if it contains a compact subgroup H of G such that the left quotient space G / H is first-countable.

Sufficiency. Suppose that G contains a compact subgroup H of G such that the left quotient space G / H is first-countable. By Theorem [\ref=t1], it follows that the mapping π:G  →  G / H is perfect. Next we show that H is of countable character in G. Indeed, let [formula] be a neighborhood base for G / H at π(e), where e is the neutral element of G. For each [formula], let Vn  =  π- 1(Un). Since the mapping π:G  →  G / H is perfect, it is easy to verify that the family [formula] is a base for G at H. Therefore, G is of almost countable type.

Necessity. Let G be of almost countable type. Then it contains a non-empty compact subgroup K that is of countable character in G by Proposition [\ref=p3]. By Lemma [\ref=l2], the left quotient space G / H is first-countable.

There exists a separable almost countable type paratopological group that is not paracompact.

Example 4.1 in [\cite=Lin2012] is a separable first-countable paratopological group, hence it is of almost countable type. However, it is not paracompact.

There exists a Lindelöf paratopological group that is not of almost countable type.

Let X be a countable non-discrete T1 space. Then the free paratopological group FP(X) is a countable T1 space [\cite=EN2012]. Obviously, FP(X) is Lindelöf and of almost subcountable type. However, it is not of almost countable type.

Almost countable type free paratopological groups

Now we can prove our main Theorems.

Since X generates the free group FPa(X) [\cite=AT2008], each element g∈FPa(X) has the form [formula], where [formula] and [formula]. This word for g is called reduced if it contains no pair of consecutive symbols of the form xx- 1 or x- 1x. It follows that if the word g is reduced and non-empty then it is different from the neutral element of FPa(X). In particular, each element g∈FPa(X) distinct from the neutral element can be uniquely written in the form [formula], where n  ≥  1, [formula], xi∈X, and xi  ≠  xi + 1 for each [formula]. Similar assertions are valid for APa(X). For every non-negative integer n, denote by FPn(X) and APn(X) the subspace of paratopological group FP(X) and AP(X) that consists of all words of reduced length ≤  n with respect to the free basis X, respectively. Define in:n  →  FPn(X) by in((x1,x2,...xn)) = x1x2...xn for each n, where [formula]. Then each in is a continuous map.

[\cite=LFC2012] Let X be a Functionally Hausdorff space, and let A be an arbitrary subset of AP(X). If [formula] is finite for each [formula], then A is closed and discrete in AP(X).

By the group reflexion [formula] of a paratopological group (G,τ) we understand the group G endowed with the strongest topology [formula] such that [formula] is a topological group.

[\cite=PN2006] If X is a Functionally Hausdorff space then the topological groups [formula] and A(X) are topologically isomorphic.

The following conditions are equivalent for a functionally Hausdorff space X:

The FP(X) is of almost countable type;

The AP(X) is of almost countable type;

The space X is discrete.

Since AP(X) is a quotient of FP(X), it follows from Proposition [\ref=p0] that (1)⇒  (2). It is also clear that AP(X) and FP(X) over a discrete space X are discrete. Therefore, it suffices to verify that (2)⇒  (3).

By Proposition [\ref=p3], there exists a compact subgroup L  ⊂  AP(X) that is of countable character in AP(X).

Claim: L = {0}.

Suppose that L  ≠  0. Take an element [formula]. Then 〈g〉 is an infinite cyclic group of L generated by g. Then the intersection [formula] is finite for each n∈ω, hence it follows from Lemma [\ref=l0] that 〈g〉 is closed and discrete in L. However, L is compact, which is a contradiction.

By Claim, the neutral element 0 is of countable character in AP(X). By [\cite=Lin2012], the neutral element 0 is of countable character in [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=l1] that the free abelian topological group A(X) is first-countable, so X is discrete by Graev's theorem in [\cite=GM].

By Proposition [\ref=p5], we can show the following theorem by a similar proof in Theorem [\ref=t2].

Let X be functionally Hausdorff space. If AP(X) is of almost subcountable type then X is of countable pseudocharacter.

Let X be functionally Hausdorff space that is of countable pseudocharacter. Is FP(X) or AP(X) of almost subcountable type?

Let X be functionally Hausdorff space. If FP(X) is of almost subcountable type, is AP(X) of almost subcountable type?

[\cite=EN2013] If X is a T1-space, then the mapping

[formula]

is a homeomorphism.

Recall that a subset A in a space Z is called bounded (in Z) if every real-valued continuous function on Z is bounded on A.

The proof of the following theorem is a modification of [\cite=T2003]. However, for the completeness, we give out the proof.

If FP2(X) is of pointwise countable type, then [formula] is bounded in X.

From the hypothesis, there exist in FP2(X) a compact set K containing the neutral element e and a decreasing family of open sets [formula] which forms a base for FP2(X) at K. Suppose that [formula] is not bounded in X. Then there exists in X a discrete family of open sets [formula] each of which intersects [formula]. For each [formula], choose a point [formula]. Since, for each [formula], the point xn is a non-isolated point, it is easy to see that there exists a point yn∈Vn with xn  ≠  yn and x- 1nyn∈Un. Clearly, we also have x- 1nyn  ≠  x- 1mym for distinct [formula]. Put [formula].

Claim: The set B is closed and discrete in FP2(X).

Indeed, it suffices to show that B is closed in FP2(X). Let w belong to the closure of B in FP2(X). Next we shall show that w∈B.

Case 1: [formula].

Obviously, the set [formula] is open in FP2(X) and [formula], then w is not in the closure of B in FP2(X), this is a contradiction.

Case 2: w = e.

Since the family [formula] is discrete and xn and yn are distinct points in Vn, we can find a continuous quasi-pseudometric d on X such that d(xn,yn)  ≥  1 for each [formula]. Then the set [formula] is an open neighborhood of e in FP2(X) disjoint from B, where d̃ is the Graev extension of d to FP(X). Thus w is not in the closure of B in FP2(X), this is a contradiction.

Case 3: [formula].

Clearly, the set [formula] is closed in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=l3], it is easy to see that w∈B.

Since K is compact, it cannot contain an infinite subset of B. Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula]. Then [formula] is an open set containing K but not containing Un for any [formula], which is a contradiction. Therefore, we conclude that [formula] is bounded in X, as required.

If the closure of every bounded set in a space Z is compact, then Z is called a μ-space.

If FP2(X) is of pointwise countable type and X is a μ-space, then [formula] is compact.

If FP2(X) is of pointwise countable type, is [formula] compact?

[\cite=EN2012] Let X be a T1-space and let [formula] be a reduced word in FPn(X), where xi∈X and εi  =    ±  1, for all [formula], and if xi = xi + 1 for some [formula], then εi  =  εi + 1. Then the collection [formula] of all sets of the form [formula], where, for all [formula], the set Ui is a neighborhood of xi in X when εi = 1 and Ui  =  {xi} when εi =  - 1 is a base for the neighborhood system at w in FPn(X).

[\cite=EN2012] Let X be a T1-space and let [formula] be a reduced word in APn(X), where xi∈X and εi  =    ±  1, for all [formula], and if xi = xj for some [formula], then εi  =  εj. Then the collection [formula] of all sets of the form [formula], where, for all [formula], the set Ui is a neighborhood of xi in X when εi = 1 and Ui  =  {xi} when εi =  - 1 is a base for the neighborhood system at w in APn(X).

Let X be a set. Define j2,k2:X  ×  X  →  Fa(X) by j2(x,y) = x- 1y and k2(x,y) = yx- 1.

By a quasi-uniform space [formula] we mean the natural analog of a uniform space obtained by dropping the symmetry axiom. We also recall that the universal quasi-uniformity [formula] of a space X is the finest quasi-uniformity on X that induces on X its original topology.

[\cite=EN2013] Let X be a topological space. Then the collection [formula] of sets [formula] for [formula] is a base of neighborhoods at the identity e in FP2(X).

[\cite=LFC2012] Let X be a topological space. Then the collection [formula] of sets W(U) for [formula] is a base of neighborhoods at the identity e in AP2(X), where W(U) = { - x + y:(x,y)∈U}.

The proof of the following theorem is a modification of [\cite=T2003]. However, for the completeness, we give out the proof.

Let X be an arbitrary T1 space and φ:FP(X)  →  AP(X) be the canonical homomorphism FP(X) onto AP(X). Then the restriction φ2|FP2(X) is a perfect mapping of FP2(X) onto AP2(X).

Clearly, for each y∈AP2(X), we have |φ- 12(y)|  ≤  2, hence the fibers of φ2 are compact. Next we shall show that φ2 is closed at every point g∈AP2(X).

Case 1: [formula], where 0 denotes the neutral element of AP(X).

Obviously, the set [formula] is clopen in FP2(X), [formula] is clopen in AP2(X), φ- 12(Z) = Y and the restriction of φ2 to Y is a homeomorphism from Y onto Z. Therefore, φ2 is closed at every point of Z.

Case 2: [formula].

Let g = ε1x1  +  ε2x2  ≠  0, where x1,x2∈X and ε1,ε2  =    ±  1. Then we have

[formula]

Let O be an open set in FP2(X) containing φ- 12(g). By Theorem [\ref=t4], there exist subsets U1 and U2 in X satisfying the following conditions (1)-(3):

(1) For each i = 1,2, if εi = 1 then Ui is an open neighborhood of xi in X; if εi =  - 1 then Ui  =  {xi}.

(2) [formula];

(3) If ε1  +  ε2 = 0, then [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=t5], the set V = ε1U1  +  ε2U2 is an open neighborhood of g in AP2(X), and one easily checks that

[formula]

Therefore, φ2 is closed at g.

Case 3: g = 0.

Clearly, we have φ- 12(0) = {e}. Let O be a neighborhood of e in FP2(X). By Theorem [\ref=t6], there exists [formula] such that [formula] It follows from Theorem [\ref=t8] that W(U) = { - x + y:(x,y)∈U} is an open neighborhood of 0 in AP2(X). Obviously, we have [formula]. Therefore, φ2 is closed at 0.

Remark [\cite=T2003]: It is worth mentioning that Theorem [\ref=l4] cannot be generalized to n = 3. Indeed, let X be an infinite T1-space. Denote by φ3 the restriction of the canonical homomorphism φ:FP(X)  →  AP(X) to FP3(X). Take an arbitrary point x0∈X. Then φ- 13(x0) contains the closed and discrete set {xx0x- 1:x∈X}, hence φ- 13(x0) is not compact. Therefore, φ3 fails to be a perfect mapping.

It is well known that countable type and local compactness are both invariant and inverse invariant properties of perfect mappings, hence we have the following result.

Let X be an arbitrary Hausdorff space. Then we have

If AP2(X) is of pointwise countable type, then FP2(X) is of pointwise countable type;

AP2(X) is of countable type if and only if FP2(X) is of countable type;

AP2(X) is locally compact if and only if FP2(X) is locally compact.

Let X be an arbitrary Hausdorff μ-space. If AP2(X) or FP2(X) is locally compact, then X is homeomorphic to the topological sum of a compact space and a discrete space.

By Theorem [\ref=t7] and Proposition [\ref=p7], the set [formula] is bounded in X, then [formula] is compact since X is a μ-space. Since AP2(X) or FP2(X) is locally compact, X is local compact. Then it is easy to see that X is homeomorphism to the topological sum of a compact space and a discrete space.

The following two questions are still unknown.

If X is homeomorphic to the topological sum of a compact space and a discrete space, is AP2(X) or FP2(X) locally compact?

Can we find a topological property P such that AP2(X) or FP2(X) is of point-countable type or countable type if and only if X has the property P?
