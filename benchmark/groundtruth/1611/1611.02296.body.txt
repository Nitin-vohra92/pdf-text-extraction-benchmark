Clustering of non-ergodic eigenstates in quantum spin glasses

Many systems under experimental investigation as platforms for many-body localization (MBL) [\cite=Altshuler1997] [\cite=Basko2006] [\cite=Oganesyan2007] [\cite=Pal2010] [\cite=Serbyn2013] [\cite=Huse2014] [\cite=Kjall2014] [\cite=Schreiber2015] [\cite=Altland2016] have long-range interactions that mediate the direct transport of excitations. This includes disordered electronic materials [\cite=Ladieu1996] [\cite=Ovadia2015], ion traps [\cite=Smith2016], interacting NV centers in diamond [\cite=kucsko2016thermalization] [\cite=choi2016observation], and superconducting qubit devices developed for adiabatic quantum computing [\cite=Johnson2011] [\cite=boixo2014evidence] [\cite=boixo2016computational]. In sufficiently long-ranged systems, the proliferation of long-distance resonances precludes quantum mechanical localization [\cite=Anderson1958] [\cite=Logan1987] [\cite=Levitov1999] [\cite=Yao2014] [\cite=Burin2015], an intuitive result strongly supported by analytic work over the last half century. Nevertheless, the quantum Random Energy Model (QREM), an infinite-range spin glass, was recently shown to exhibit a phase with localized eigenstates at finite energy density [\cite=Laumann2014] [\cite=Baldwin2016]. The QREM provides an analytically tractable framework for studying mobility edges and configuration-space localization. This raises the obvious question of how localization survives despite the infinite-range interactions and what role it plays in more realistic long-range systems.

Some insight comes from considering the distribution of local fields -- i.e., the energy required to flip one of the system's N spins relative to a given configuration. In the QREM, flipping a spin typically changes the energy by O(N). Thus the quantum fluctuations which lead to the proliferation of resonances are strongly suppressed. However, short-range models have O(1) local fields, and in fact, so do power-law and infinite-range systems with general p-body interactions. This suggests that the eigenstate-localized phase of the QREM is an exceptional case among long-range models: strict configuration-space localization cannot exist in any model with O(1) local fields, since the introduction of quantum dynamics causes resonant fluctuations.

In this paper, we study the eigenstate properties of the quantum p-spin models [\cite=Goldschmidt1990a] [\cite=Nieuwenhuizen1998] [\cite=Cugliandolo2004] [\cite=Jorg2008], a family of infinite-range quantum spin glasses. These models have O(1) local fields and reproduce the QREM in the p  →    ∞   limit. At large but finite p, we find that the QREM's phase of strictly localized eigenstates gives way to a phase of partially delocalized yet non-ergodic eigenstates (blue in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase_diagram]), similar to what was observed in the context of single-particle localization on the Bethe lattice [\cite=Biroli2012] [\cite=DeLuca2014] [\cite=Altshuler2016]. This is in contrast to the fully-delocalized paramagnetic phase (orange in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase_diagram]), in which eigenstates satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [\cite=Deutsch1991] [\cite=Srednicki1994] [\cite=Rigol2008] and thus exhibit thermal behavior.

The formal distinction that we make between ergodic, non-ergodic, and MBL eigenstates concerns the off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators between them. Schematically, denote by σ̂ any operator suppported on O(1) spins and consider the state σ̂|Ψ〉 (with |Ψ〉 an eigenstate). According to ETH [\cite=Srednicki1999], the overlap with any other eigenstate |Φ〉 at the same energy density ε should scale as [formula], where [formula] is the thermodynamic entropy density and f is a smooth function of ε and the energy difference. Our analysis below suggests that the eigenstates of the ETH phase in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase_diagram] obey this scaling. On the other hand, in an MBL phase σ̂|Ψ〉 should have significant weight only on O(1)-many eigenstates [\cite=Basko2006], a notion one can make precise through a participation ratio (e.g., [formula]). We find that the eigenstates of the non-ergodic phase do not obey this definition of MBL, even though they violate ETH. Rather, they are organized into "clusters" (defined below). Within a cluster c, eigenstates follow ETH-type scaling:

[formula]

but off-diagonal matrix elements between clusters are heavily suppressed (c  ≠  c'),

[formula]

Here, |    ·    (c)〉,|    ·    (c')〉 are eigenstates belonging to each cluster. sc(ε) is the entropy density within c (which is strictly less than [formula]), and fc is a smooth, cluster-dependent O(1) function. More physically, such non-ergodic eigenstates are thermal within a cluster but not thermal in configuration space as a whole.

Concretely, the quantum p-spin models are defined by

[formula]

where the classical term HCp sums over all distinct p-tuples of N spins and the quantum term HQ provides a uniform transverse field. From the configuration-space perspective, HCp is the random potential and HQ hops on the edges of the hypercube. The random couplings [formula] are i.i.d. Gaussians of mean 0 and variance [formula], to ensure extensivity. These models, and in particular the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (p  =  2) [\cite=Sherrington1975] [\cite=Parisi1979], feature prominently in the theory of mean-field spin glasses [\cite=Derrida1980] [\cite=Gross1984] [\cite=Gardner1985] [\cite=Kirkpatrick1987]. It is known [\cite=Goldschmidt1990a] that the thermodynamic free energy of Hp approaches that of the QREM as p increases. As we will see, the eigenstate phases of the p-spin model also approach those of the QREM in this limit. In order to show this, we study the eigenstates within the forward-scattering approximation (FSA) [\cite=Pietracaprina2016], and determine the leading-in-[formula] behavior.

Before we turn to the detailed analysis, it is useful to consider the p-spin models in terms of Anderson localization on the N-dimensional hypercube defined by the σz configuration space. The QREM corresponds to a hopping model in an uncorrelated Gaussian random potential of bandwidth [formula]. This bandwidth models that of a many-body system with extensive spectrum, but the lack of correlations implies unrealistically large local fields. In the p-spin model, the potential remains Gaussian but exhibits correlations which restrict the energy differences between adjacent sites to be O(p). This leads to the entropically large clusters over which the eigenstates delocalize at short fractional Hamming distance (see below). The phase transition at finite transverse field shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase_diagram] corresponds to eigenstates tunneling between clusters.

To obtain the perturbative eigenstates we must first understand the correlations in the classical energy landscape in more detail. At Hamming distance Nx from a given configuration with energy Nε0, the random potential obeys a conditional distribution [\cite=Derrida1980],

[formula]

At distance [formula], corresponding to a single spin flip, this expression provides the distribution of local fields. It is easy to check that these are indeed O(p) and that [formula] even in the thermodynamic limit.

Using Eq. [\eqref=eq:conditional_classical_energies], the average number of states at fractional distance x with energy density ε matching ε0 is [formula], with

[formula]

In order to compare with the literature, it is useful to parametrize ε0 through the temperature T defined by formal Legendre transform, even when the system fails to thermalize dynamically. It is shown in the Appendix that [formula]. Eq. [\eqref=eq:annealed_position_entropy] is an annealed average which provides a rigorous upper bound for the typical number of states, since [formula]. When s(x)  <  0, we know with certainty that there are no configurations at x with energy density ε0.

The entropy s(x) is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropy_curve] for p  =  6 as illustration (we show only x∈[null], since s(1  -  x)  =  s(x)). A transition occurs at the temperature T*. At T  >  T*, there are configurations over the entire range of x, whereas at T  <  T*, there is a "forbidden" region (x*(T),x*  *(T)) in which no configurations lie. We have rigorously confirmed the presence of three distinct regions via a second-moment analysis, analogous to that done in Ref. [\cite=mezard2005clustering]. See the Appendix for details. Thus the configurations at energy ε0 form disconnected clusters of Hamming size x*(T). Energy levels within a cluster are highly correlated, but those of different clusters are essentially independent (see Eq. [\eqref=eq:conditional_classical_energies]). This behavior is analogous to the clustering phenomenon observed in a variety of other settings, e.g., k-SAT problems [\cite=mezard2005clustering], coloring of random graphs [\cite=Mulet2002], and in particular, the replica theory of spin glasses (more discussion below).

By setting s(x)  =  ∂xs(x)  =  0, we find that

[formula]

Note that T*  →    ∞   as p  →    ∞  . Furthermore, at T  ≪  T*, [formula] whereas x*  *(T)  ~  O(1) (with respect to p). Thus the clusters below T* are well separated, and they become arbitrarily small as p increases. Regardless, the clusters cover a macroscopic Hamming distance at any finite p.

With this understanding of how the classical states at energy density ε0 are organized, we now introduce the transverse field Γ and study eigenstates using the FSA [\cite=Pietracaprina2016]. The eigenstate |Ψα〉 may be expressed as a perturbation series in Γ starting from a classical state |α〉. The amplitude on a different classical state |β〉 is a sum over the directed sequences ("paths") of spin flips that transform α into β:

[formula]

where xαβ is the fractional Hamming distance between α and β, the sum is over the (Nxαβ)! sequences, and Pj is the j'th configuration along sequence P. See Ref. [\cite=Baldwin2016] for a more detailed explanation.

If |〈β|Ψα〉|  ~  1, we say that β and α are resonant. Knowing where resonances occur in configuration space tells us where the eigenstate amplitude is concentrated. We show in the Appendix that the typical path amplitude to a configuration at distance Nx is of the form e- Nk(x). A replica calculation (also in the Appendix), which treats |〈β|Ψα〉| as the partition function for a directed random polymer, suggests that the sum in Eq. [\eqref=eq:FSA_general_expression] is dominated collectively by typical paths and not by rare fluctuations. Thus the expected number of resonances at x is eNf(x) with

Fig. [\ref=fig:num_res] shows the three different qualitative behaviors of f(x) as T and Γ are varied. First consider T  ≪  T*. There are resonances at small enough x (see the bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:num_res]) which belong to the same cluster as the unperturbed state. These are inevitable. Regardless of how small Γ is, a non-zero fraction of spins will have much smaller local fields and resonate. On the other hand, resonances belonging to different clusters only appear when Γ exceeds a critical Γc(T).

In principle, we should treat the intra-cluster states within degenerate perturbation theory and then perturb the hybridized states. We expect that this will cause further resonances in the initial cluster, until eventually every configuration in the cluster has hybridized. However, since they cannot extend past x*  ≪  O(1), this effect only gives subleading corrections to the number of resonances in other clusters. For Γ  <  Γc(T), the eigenstate amplitude outside of its cluster is exponentially suppressed relative to inside. This leads us to assert that an excitation, e.g., σ̂|Ψ〉, has weight distributed chaotically amongst those eigenstates within |Ψ〉's cluster but has much less weight elsewhere. The precise statement of this idea is Eq. [\eqref=eq:cluster_ETH].

Conversely, the inter-cluster hybridization that occurs for Γ  >  Γc(T) does significantly affect the wavefunction. Since different clusters have essentially independent energies, we expect that such resonances lead to more in other clusters, until the wavefunction ultimately extends throughout the entire configuration space. Off-diagonal matrix elements are then expected to obey ETH. We also cannot neglect the hybridizations within a cluster if the separation between clusters is comparable to their lengths, i.e., if [formula], and we expect these eigenstates to be ergodic as well. Thus the red and green curves in Fig. [\ref=fig:num_res] do not accurately represent their respective eigenstates. It remains an open problem to calculate these states and check the predictions of ETH.

Regardless, we can determine Γc(T) to leading order. By requiring that the maximum of f(x) over all x  >  x*(T) be 0 (see Appendix), we obtain the portion of the blue curve below T* in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase_diagram]. To within [formula] corrections, this is identical to that of the QREM [\cite=Baldwin2016]. Since T* diverges as p increases, we find that the non-ergodic phase of Hp does indeed map continuously onto the MBL phase of [formula].

Furthermore, since the short-distance resonances occupy a small corner of configuration space, they do not affect observable properties commonly associated with MBL. One prominent observable in spin-glass theory is the Edwards-Anderson order parameter [formula], where the average is with respect to the Gibbs distribution. We define an eigenstate variant [formula]. Note that [formula] whenever ETH holds. Heuristically, [formula] measures how similar the configurations are for which |Ψ〉 has significant amplitude. [formula] means that measuring the σz configuration within state |Ψ〉 will consistently give macroscopically similar results. One can then associate a specific magnetization pattern to |Ψ〉. As shown in the Appendix, in the non-ergodic phase of Hp,

[formula]

Compare to ergodic eigenstates in the paramagnetic phase, which have [formula].

The level statistics in the non-ergodic phase is Poisson as well, just as in many-body-localized systems. Regardless of how the eigenstates hybridize within a cluster, they cannot do so over more than the total number of configurations in the cluster, which is eN exp (  -  pε20) (see Appendix). These levels strongly repel and have GOE statistics, but the spacing between them scales no smaller than e- N exp (  -  pε20). On the other hand, different clusters have independent fluctuations in energy levels, and the number of clusters is at least [formula]. The spectra of different clusters interpenetrate, so the level statistics is Poisson. This is sketched in Fig. [\ref=fig:clusters].

Thus the FSA predicts that even though the many-body eigenstates of Hp are necessarily delocalized over an exponential number of configurations, they are highly non-ergodic at low T and small Γ. Numerical studies, e.g., exact diagonalization, could provide an important validation of this picture, yet one would need to study large p to separate the various features. The model loses its meaning if p is comparable to N, so one needs N  ≫  p  ≫  1 to conduct high-quality numerics. Current state-of-the-art techniques are limited to N  ≈  30 [\cite=Luitz2015] [\cite=Lerose2015], which is too small to separate these scales.

Regardless, the existence of clusters and a phase of non-ergodic eigenstates only requires the combinatorial arguments that we have described. Since this phase looks very similar to a many-body-localized phase in some regards, it raises the obvious question of how the two are related. The underlying physics is different: MBL is intrinsically a result of quantum interference, whereas the non-ergodic phase is more a consequence of O(N) energy and entropy barriers. In that respect, it relates more to the classical theory of glassiness in mean-field systems.

The relationship to mean-field spin-glass theory, and in particular the replica theory [\cite=Mezard1987] [\cite=Mezard2009], is potentially very deep. Most prominent is the connection between our T* and the "dynamical" transition temperature Td [\cite=Sompolinksy1981] [\cite=Kirkpatrick1987] [\cite=Cugliandolo2004]. One interpretation of Td is that below it, the Gibbs distribution concentrates around clusters in configuration space (although the equilibrium properties may still be paramagnetic). The heuristic picture is very similar to that of the transition we identify at T*, and although they are obtained through independent means, Eq. [\eqref=eq:T_d_behavior] for the asymptotic behavior of T* agrees exactly with Td in the literature [\cite=Ferrari2012]. The exact relationship between our calculations and the standard canonical analysis remains to be established. In Ref. [\cite=Cugliandolo2004] the authors studied Hp via replica theory and found an entire curve Td(Γ), which in other models was shown to relate to real-time dynamics in the presence of a heat bath [\cite=Cugliandolo2001]. That transition lies above the non-ergodic/ETH transition in Fig. [\ref=fig:phase_diagram]; the connection between the two is an interesting open question.

On that note, it was recently argued [\cite=chandran2016many] that the ergodicity of eigenstates need not imply ergodicity of dynamics. It is possible that the decay time of classical initial states might diverge in the thermodynamic limit when T  <  T*, even when the corresponding eigenstates are ergodic. If this is so, the thermodynamic curve Td(Γ) may describe the quench behavior of Hp rather than the eigenstate properties.

And finally, the intra-cluster structure of the non-ergodic eigenstates may be very rich. The ultrametric structure of Parisi's solution [\cite=Mezard1984] suggests that a cluster is organized into subclusters, which themselves have subclusters, and so on. The non-ergodic phase may actually be many different phases, with varying degrees of ergodicity-breaking corresponding to how many levels of clusters the eigenstates tunnel through, analogous to the physical picture of replica-symmetry-breaking.

Appendix to "Clustering of non-ergodic eigenstates in quantum spin glasses"

Thermodynamics in the paramagnetic phase.

Before studying the eigenstates of the p-spin model, we describe the paramagnetic phase of the model's thermodynamics. This analysis comes from Goldschmidt's paper [\cite=Goldschmidt1990a], in which he applies the (imaginary-time) path-integral replica formalism to this model. He also makes the static approximation, i.e., sets the imaginary-time spin autocorrelation to a constant. Yet since the paramagnetic phase is replica-symmetric, we do not include any discussion of replica-symmetry-breaking.

Starting from Eq. 19 in [\cite=Goldschmidt1990a] with Q  =  λ  =  0, the free energy is

[formula]

χ is the correlation [formula] of a single spin between different imaginary times k and k', and ν is the associated Lagrange multiplier. It is standard to make the static approximation, in which [formula] is assumed independent of k  -  k'. The equations that minimize f are

[formula]

[formula]

In the limit ν  ≪  1,

[formula]

Concretely, this expansion is valid so long as ν  ≪  Γ2,ΓT.

In the limit ν  ≫  1,

[formula]

In going from the first to the second line, we took [formula]. This expansion is valid so long as ν  ≫  T2,ΓT.

Thus

[formula]

The saddle-point equation [\eqref=eq:free_energy_equation_2] (i.e., ∂νf  =  0) then becomes

[formula]

Together with Eq. [\eqref=eq:free_energy_equation_1], we find two solutions. The quantum paramagnetic solution is [formula], with free energy

[formula]

The classical paramagnetic solution is [formula], with free energy

[formula]

We determine which is the equilibrium solution by setting fQ  =  fC. The resulting phase boundary Γb(T) is always O(1). For Γ  <  Γb(T), the classical paramagnetic free energy is lower. For Γ  >  Γb(T), the quantum paramagnetic free energy is lower.

This calculation is only correct when the temperature is low enough for the equilibrium solution to match the asymptotics we assumed. The classical solution requires [formula]. Since it is the equilibrium solution when [formula], this amounts to [formula]. Similary, the quantum solution requires [formula], which for Γ  ~  O(1) amounts to [formula].

For the current paper, we're interested in small Γ, i.e., the classical paramagnetic phase. So we have

[formula]

The energy density at temperature T is

[formula]

The thermodynamic entropy density is

[formula]

Eq. [\eqref=eq:energy_temperature_relation] is the relationship between energy and temperature used throughout the main text. Note that we only make use of Eq. [\eqref=eq:energy_temperature_relation] for [formula], and for those temperatures [formula] to leading order in [formula].

Distribution of classical energies.

The classical energy of a configuration α in the p-spin model is

[formula]

where the sum is over all distinct p-tuples of N spins. The couplings [formula] are independent Gaussians of mean 0 and variance [formula]. Since [formula] for each [formula], Eα is a sum of Gaussians. Thus it is Gaussian itself, of mean 0 and variance [formula]. In terms of the energy density,

[formula]

where A1 is the normalization.

Now consider the joint distribution for configurations α and β that differ in the value of Nxαβ spins. Eα and Eβ are determined by sums over the same couplings. A given term [formula] will contribute the same value for both if an even number of the Nxαβ differing spins are in the tuple [formula]. It will contribute opposite values if an odd number are involved. Let [formula] denote the number of p-tuples that contain an even number of the differing spins, and [formula] denote the number that contain an odd number. Then [formula] is a sum of [formula] Gaussians and [formula] is a sum of [formula] different Gaussians. Note that

[formula]

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

[formula]

The variance of [formula] is [formula], and the variance of [formula] is [formula]. Thus the joint distribution of εα and εβ is

[formula]

with A2 the normalization.

The annealed distance-resolved entropy. Transition temperatures and cluster properties.

Here we consider the following question: if a given configuration α has energy density ε0, how many of the other configurations with energy density ε0 are at Hamming distance Nx from α? As long as ε0 is above the ground-state energy density, there will be some configurations having ε0 with probability 1. Since the configurations are all statistically equivalent, the fraction of disorder realizations in which α is localized given it has ε0 is equal to the fraction of all eigenstates at ε0 (over all disorder realizations) that are localized. Thus we pick some arbitrary reference configuration and condition on it having energy density ε0.

The conditional distribution for a configuration at distance x is

[formula]

The expected number of configurations at x with ε0 is then eNs(x) with

[formula]

As x  →  0+, s(x)  ~   - x ln x  >  0. Also, [formula], the (annealed) thermodynamic entropy. As long as ε0 lies within the spectrum, st(T)  >  0. Thus s(x) is positive as x approaches both endpoints of

[formula]

Replica calculation of the forward-scattering wavefunction.

From the main text, the forward-scattering expression for an eigenstate |Ψ〉 of the quantum p-spin model is

[formula]

Here α and β are classical configurations of energy Eα and Eβ, separated by Hamming distance Nxαβ. At Γ  =  0, |Ψ〉  =  |α〉. The sum is over all (Nxαβ)! direct "paths" (i.e., sequences of spin flips) from configuration α to configuration β, and γj is the j'th configuration along path P. From now on we'll take [formula] and [formula]. We'll also assume that the statistics of 〈β|Ψ〉, having very heavy tails, aren't significantly affected by cancellations among paths. Thus we make the analytically expedient replacement

[formula]

In the main text, we assumed that all paths leading up to β have typical amplitudes, and then determined the probability that |E0  -  Eβ| is small enough to make |〈β|Ψ〉|  >  1. Here "typical" means replacing each Eγj by its mean value, which from Eq. [\eqref=eq:conditional_distribution] is [formula] (note that configuration γj by definition differs from α by j spin-flips). We find that

[formula]

with

[formula]

Note that in the main text, we had instead used the notation [formula].

Here we go beyond the typical amplitudes by making a replica-symmetry-breaking ansatz, to see whether the typical value of the sum in Eq. [\eqref=eq:forward_scattering_magnitude_approx] is approximated by the sum of the typical values. We compute [formula] assuming one step of replica-symmetry-breaking. The n replicated paths cluster into [formula] independent groups of m identical paths each:

[formula]

The second line is our replica-symmetry-breaking ansatz. Recall that within this framework, 0←n  <  m  ≤  1. To make further progress, we replace

[formula]

even though the energies along a path are correlated. Although this isn't a controlled approximation, it does still let us probe how rare fluctuations might dominate the sum. Denoting [formula],

[formula]

Two things are happening with this expression. The first integral has a saddle-point contribution:

[formula]

However, this expression does not diverge as m  →  1-, yet we know the full expression does. We must be careful that the diverging part of the integral doesn't get buried in a remainder. For that, we integrate by parts:

[formula]

and similarly for the second integral. Putting Eqs. [\eqref=eq:moment_saddle_point] and [\eqref=eq:moment_integrate_by_parts] together, we have that

[formula]

where we've defined [formula].

Eq. [\eqref=eq:moment_asymptotics] goes into Eq. [\eqref=eq:1RSB_ansatz]:

[formula]

with

[formula]

[formula]

We now minimize with respect to m (recall that within the replica formalism we minimize instead of maximize). The minimum exists at a non-trivial value [formula] because [formula] as m  →  0 and as m  →  1. We need to solve [formula], which can be written

[formula]

It would be very difficult to fully solve this equation for [formula], but we can pull out how [formula] scales with N. We'll find that Δ  ≪  1. First consider

[formula]

Bj  ≫  1 (as Δ  →  0) when [formula]. Bj is small otherwise. Assuming [formula] (we'll see that this turns out to be true), [formula] corresponds to [formula]. The maximum of Bj is [formula], at [formula]. Thus we have the bounds

[formula]

for suitable choices of the constants C1 and C2. Since [formula], we see that this sum is negligible compared to [formula] in Eq. [\eqref=eq:m_eq_equation]. Similarly, the RHS of Eq. [\eqref=eq:m_eq_equation] is bounded by

[formula]

for suitable choices of the constants D1 and D2. Since Δ is chosen so that this sum is essentially [formula],

[formula]

We see that [formula], so that

[formula]

with δ(  ·  ,  ·  ) an O(1) function. Although δ(Nx,pε20) does vary with N, it stays O(1) as N  →    ∞  .

Thus

[formula]

Our final result for the average log-amplitude, which is to be compared with the "typical" estimate in Eqs. [\eqref=eq:typical_wavefunction] and [\eqref=eq:typical_coupling_exponent], is

[formula]

We see that the corrections to Eq. [\eqref=eq:typical_coupling_exponent] vanish in the thermodynamic limit, even when allowing for one step of replica-symmetry-breaking. This justifies our use of the "typical" estimate, denoted k(x), in the main text.

MBL phase boundary.

As justified in the previous section, the amplitude of eigenstate |Ψ〉 on configuration |β〉 is

[formula]

with k(x) given by Eq. [\eqref=eq:typical_coupling_exponent]. Here E0 is the energy of the eigenstate, related to temperature by Eq. [\eqref=eq:energy_temperature_relation], and Nx is the Hamming distance from β to the unperturbed (Γ  =  0) configuration. Assuming e- Nk(x)  ≪  1 (which it is for all T and Γ of interest), |E0  -  Eβ| must be exponentially small for β to be resonant. The distribution of Eβ is essentially uniform on such small scales, so a fraction e- Nk(x) of the configurations at distance x with energy density ε0 resonate. There are eNs(x) such configurations, with s(x) given by Eq. [\eqref=eq:annealed_position_entropy], so the average number of resonant configurations at distance x is eNf(x), with

[formula]

If f(x)  <  0, then the probability of having any resonance at distance x is 0 in the thermodynamic limit. If f(x)  >  0, then there are resonances at distance x and the eigenstate |Ψ〉 is hybridized among them. The forward-scattering expression Eq. [\eqref=eq:forward_scattering_general_expression] is then invalid, yet one could in principle write down an analogous expression in terms of "paths" among hybridized states. These states would then hybridize if further resonances are found, etc.

For now, consider p large and x independent of p. Then (1  -  2x)p  →  0 and

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Note that this expression is valid only for x  ~  O(1) with respect to [formula]. We recover the expression previously obtained for the REM as p  →    ∞   [\cite=Baldwin2016]. As done in Ref. [\cite=Baldwin2016], we identify any eigenstate with f(x)  >  0 for some x  ~  O(1) as delocalized. We consider the case of x  ≪  1 separately. The maximum of Eq. [\eqref=eq:num_res_expression_large_limit] is at [formula], with a value of

[formula]

Γc(ε0) (expressed as Γc(T) in the main text) is defined by [formula]. For small ε0,

[formula]

The corrections to the REM phase boundary are only [formula], yet we see that for any fixed p, this expression breaks down at [formula]. In fact, problems emerge outside of this range as well, due to the behavior of f(x) at small x.

For [formula],

[formula]

This expression is positive for [formula], where

[formula]

Compare to x* in Eq. [\eqref=eq:initial_cluster_size]. Thus there are always resonances at small enough x, which lie in the local cluster of configurations at x  <  x*. Suppose for now that ε0  ~  O(1), so that [formula] and x* are exponentially small in p. We have no way of describing the wavefunction amplitude on these resonant configurations, and restarting the perturbation series around them will undoubtedly put additional configurations into resonance. But regardless of how the wavefunction hybridizes, there cannot be any resonances at x∈(x*,x*  *), simply because none of those configurations have energy density ε0. Thus the entropy of resonances f(x) at x  >  x*  * is only corrected by an exponentially small amount if we start the forward-scattering at any short-distance resonance, even under the worst-case assumption that the resonances extend to x*. And furthermore, we show in the section below that the properties of localized eigenstates are controlled by the amplitude at distances much larger than x*, so the short-distance resonances do not affect observables either. All this is to say that, at least for ε0  ~  O(1), none of our conclusions above or in the main text are affected by the short-distance resonances that we're unable to correct for.

However, this reasoning relies on the separation between clusters being much larger than the length of a cluster, which breaks down when [formula]. Thus our description of the localized eigenstates, in particular Eq. [\eqref=eq:phase_boundary] and the section below, only applies to those with [formula].

Observables in the localized phase.

The localized eigenstates have a highly-correlated "core" that extends no farther than x*, and also a tail in which the wavefunction amplitudes are typical. Any amplitude at distance x  >  x* must lie between e- Nk(x  +  x*) and e- Nk(x  -  x*) (see Eq. [\eqref=eq:typical_wavefunction]), since these are the extreme locations within the core from which one could forward-scatter. Assuming x  ≫  x*, the leading behavior of the exponent is simply - k(x). Then the total weight in the tail of the wavefunction is

[formula]

The saddle-point is at [formula]. For now, assume that Γ is not exponentially small in p, so that xw is indeed much larger than x*. The total weight in the tail scales as

[formula]

Even if we assume every configuration in the core has amplitude 1 (i.e., as much weight as the unperturbed state), the core cannot contribute more weight than [formula]. Thus the tail of the wavefunction contains all the weight. This allows us to compute observables.

The inverse participation ratio (IPR) of an eigenstate is defined as

[formula]

The IPR quantifies how many basis states |α〉 the wavefunction |Ψ〉 is spread over. In our case, the Hilbert space has dimension 2N. A wavefunction with Y2  =  2- N has equal weight on all basis states, whereas a wavefunction with Y2  =  1 only has weight on a single basis state. As before, we find that [formula] is dominated by states in the tail:

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Compare ln Y -  12 with the thermodynamic entropy (Eq. [\eqref=eq:thermodynamic_entropy]). We see that although the localized wavefunction spreads over exponentially many configurations, it still covers an exponentially small fraction of the total number at ε0.

We next consider the quantity [formula] defined as

[formula]

This is an eigenstate analogue to the Edwards-Anderson order parameter [formula]. Whereas the average in [formula] is over the Gibbs distribution, in Eq. [\eqref=eq:q_ES_definition] we average over the distribution defined by the eigenstate |Ψ〉. [formula] gives the overlap between two independent measurements of the σz configuration within |Ψ〉. To see this, define [formula], where |α〉 is a σz basis state. Then

[formula]

The quantity [formula] is the spin overlap between configurations α and β, exactly as in mean-field spin glass theory.

To evaluate [formula] in a localized eigenstate, first note that Qαβ  =  1  -  2xαβ, with xαβ the fractional Hamming distance between α and β. Then

[formula]

Here x is the distance to α from the origin, y is the distance to β from the origin, and z is the distance from α to β. Note that z must be between |x  -  y| and x  +  y, and the number of β that satisfy this geometry for each α is [formula]. The saddle-point in z is at z*  =  x  +  y  -  2xy, and [formula] (to leading order). We then have separate saddle-point integrals over x and y, both of which are dominated by [formula]. The end result is that

[formula]

As mentioned above, these estimates do implicitly assume that Γ  ≫  e- pε20. If Γ is exponentially small in p, then the bulk of the wavefunction amplitude is in the core and these estimates do not apply. However, the wavefunctions are still localized, and the qualitative results in this section hold: ln Y -  12 is much smaller than the thermodynamic entropy, and [formula] is close to 1.
