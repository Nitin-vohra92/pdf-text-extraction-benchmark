Introduction

While Lyapunov exponents of analytic one-frequency Schrödinger cocycles are positive when the coupling constants are large (uniformly in frequency and in energy)[\cite=ss] [\cite=bourgain2005green], in general, there have been no explicit/quantitative lower estimates. The only such known explicit estimates are celebrated Herman's subharmonicity bounds: for [formula] there is a uniform bound: L(E)  ≥   ln |aM|. This is of course not effective if |aM| is small. In this paper we present the first explicit bound that takes into account other coefficients.

Namely, we consider the discrete Schrödinger operator of the following form:

[formula]

where [formula]. It is known in physics literature as generalized Harper's model (e.g. [\cite=23] [\cite=38]), of special interest because of its connection to the three dimensional quantum Hall effect[\cite=23] [\cite=35].

Analyzing the solution of the equation Hu = Eu from the dynamical systems point of view leads to the consideration of Schrödinger cocycle (α,A), where

[formula]

The Lyapunov exponent(LE) of (α,A) is given by where and A- n(x) = An(x - nα)- 1. We call An(x) the n step transfer matrix. Notice that A depends on E; sometimes we will drop this dependence from the notations, for simplicity.

By Herman's arguments [\cite=herman1983methode], we have that LE  ≥   ln |a2| for all [formula]. This yields that LE > 0 if |a2| > 1. Also, LE  ≥   ln |a1| if a2 = 0. By the continuity of Lyapunov exponent in the cocycle (Theorem [\ref=ContinuousLE]), we still have LE  >  0 if |a1| > 1 and a2 is small. However, Herman's method does not work to obtain a lower bound no matter how small a nonzero a2 is . In [\cite=ss] [\cite=bourgain2005green] a lower bound is obtained abstractly, for any analytic v in terms of its analytic extension, but in both cases in ways that so far have not led to concrete analytic bounds. In this paper we obtain a quantitative lower bound on the Lyapunov exponent, in terms of ln |a1| and [formula].

Suppose |a1| > 1 and [formula]. Then for all [formula],

[formula]

Our result is obtained by combining the basics of Avila's global theory [\cite=avila2009global] with Herman's subharmonicity method [\cite=herman1983methode] as developed by Bourgain [\cite=bourgain2005green], coupled with some elementary geometric considerations.

Remark. After our result was obtained, we learned that Marx, Shou, and Wellens obtained a general lower bound for the Lyapunov exponent improving Herman's results, also using the global theory [\cite=marx]. However it is difficult to extract analytic quantitative results for a concrete potential from their estimates, although numerical results are possible, leading to estimates better than ours for certain parameters.

Avila's Global Theory

Denote by [formula] the class of 1 - periodic functions on [formula], with analytic extension to some strip [formula], attaining values in [formula]. Notice that matrix A given by ([\ref=Def.cocycle]) is in [formula]. The following theorem shows the continuity of LE in the analytic category.

([\cite=jitomirskaya2005localization] [\cite=bj]) The Lyapunov exponent L(α,D) is a continuous function in [formula] at every (α,A) with [formula].

The global theory is based on the complexification of the cocycle. More precisely, given any analytic cocycle (α,D), we consider its analytic extension, (α,D(x + iε)) with |ε| < δ for some appropriate δ > 0. L(α,Dε) is referred to the Lyapunov exponent of the complexified cocycle (α,D(x + iε)). Let L(α,D) = L(α,D0).

The Lyapunov exponent L(α,Dε) is known to be a convex function of ε (e.g. Proposition A.1, [\cite=jitomirskaya2012analytic]). Thus we can introduce the acceleration of (α,D), It follows from convexity and continuity of the Lyapunov exponent that the acceleration is an upper semi-continuous function with respect to parameter ε [\cite=jitomirskaya2012analytic].

The acceleration has an important property, which is stated below.

(Quantization of acceleration[\cite=avila2009global] [\cite=avila2013complex]) Suppose [formula] and [formula], then we have [formula].

Applying Theorem [\ref=QAT] to Schrödinger cocycle (α,A), where A is given by ([\ref=Def.cocycle]), we can obtain the following lemma. Below, we always assume A is given by ([\ref=Def.cocycle]), LE(ε) = L(α,A(  ·   + iε)) and LE = LE(0). By the symmetry ( LE(ε) = LE( - ε) ) and convexity of LE(ε), we know that ω(α,D;0)  ≥  0.

For [formula], there exists an ε' > 0 such that LE(ε) = 4πε  +   ln |a2| for ε  >  ε'.

First, uniformly for [formula], one has as ε  →    +    ∞  , where By the continuity of the LE, as ε  →    +    ∞  .

By the quantization of acceleration, we obtain

In addition to the convexity and continuity of LE with respect to ε, we have that the graph (ε,LE(ε)) must be one of the four pictures below (we assume here LE > 0).

[formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

We only present the graph for LE > 0, for LE = 0, it is similar.

Note that the graph (ε,LE(ε)) depends on E. The graph can determine the spectrum σ(H).

[formula].

If LE > 0, then E∈σ(H) if and only if the graph of LE(ε) is either Fig.1 or Fig.2[\cite=avila2009global].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Maintheorem]

Before giving the proof of Theorem [\ref=Maintheorem], two lemmas are necessary.

Suppose [formula] and |vj| > 2, then we have

Lemma [\ref=EstimateA_j] can be proved by induction. For this purpose, let Actually, we can prove the following two inequalities,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Clearly, ([\ref=induction1]) and ([\ref=induction2]) hold for k = 1. Suppose ([\ref=induction1]) and ([\ref=induction2]) hold for k, then by induction,

[formula]

and This implies ([\ref=induction1]) and ([\ref=induction2]) hold for k + 1.

Suppose e4πε0  ≥  10 and a1 > 0. Then for any [formula],we have

Let aδ  =  a1e2πδ + a1e- 2πδ and bδ  =  a1e2πδ - a1e- 2πδ with δ∈{ε0,2ε0}. Then it is easy to check that is equal to the distance (E,Sδ) between point (E,0) and ellipse Sδ given by If [formula] one has

[formula]

If [formula], we have

[formula]

If [formula], we also have

[formula]

where [formula].

Putting all the cases together, we get

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Maintheorem]

Since the Lyapunov exponent L(α,A) is upper semi-continuous with respect to α [\cite=craig1983subharmonicity], we only need to prove Theorem [\ref=Maintheorem] for [formula]. Without loss of generality, assume a1,a2 > 0. Let ε0 > 0 be such that [formula]. Applying Lemma [\ref=LeMinestimate], we have for any [formula], there exists δ∈{ε0,2ε0} such that

[formula]

Case 1 : δ  =  ε0.

We first estimate the left upper element of matrix A. Computing directly, one has for any [formula],

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=EstimateA_j], we have that the left upper element of An(x + iε0) satisfies the following estimate This implies

[formula]

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

Now we will estimate I and II separately. First, one has

[formula]

where the first inequality holds by ([\ref=2case]).

We use Herman's subharmonic method to estimate I:

[formula]

Thus Suppose point [formula]. Then one has This implies that However this is impossible because [formula].

Now that [formula], we must have

[formula]

This implies

Case 2: δ = 2ε0.

In this case, we have The proof of case 2 is similar to that of case 1. We give the details below. Computing directly, one has for any [formula],

[formula]

As in ([\ref=Estepsilon_0]), we have Then we have

[formula]

Following the discussion of case 1, I and II have the following lower bounds:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus Suppose point [formula]. Then one has This implies that impossible because [formula].

Now that [formula], we must have

[formula]

therefore
