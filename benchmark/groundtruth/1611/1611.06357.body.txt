Decomposition of bent generalized Boolean functions

Keywords: Boolean functions, generalized bent functions, Walsh Hadamard transform

Introduction

Bent functions have been a popular topic in difference sets, symmetric Cryptography, and Coding theory since their introduction by Rothaus in 1976[\cite=C1]. They are a building brick of streamcipher systems, and offer optimal resistance to fast correlation attacks and affine approximation attacks [\cite=C1]. Two recent books are dedicated to this important concept [\cite=M] [\cite=T]. In recent years, a theory of generalized Boolean function, in the sense that the domain range is no longer [formula] but an arbitrary [formula] has arisen [\cite=Stan] [\cite=ST] [\cite=T].

In this paper we extend the theory of decomposition of quaternary Boolean functions of [\cite=SSS], from q = 4 to q an arbitrary power of 2. First, we establish the decomposition for regular bent functions, then apply it to self-dual bent functions, which are regular by definition. As a byproduct, we give a necessary existence condition for regular generalized bent functions. More importantly, we use this decomposition to classify regular bent functions (q a power of 2) under the action of the extended affine group when the number of variables is at most 4.

The material is organized as follows. The next section collects the notations and definitions that we need in the rest of the paper. Section 3 develops the decomposition technique for generalized bent functions. Section 4 classifies regular quaternary bent function under the action of the affine group. Section 5 concludes the article.

Definitions and notation

Bent functions

A Boolean function in n variables is any function from [formula] to [formula] The set of all 22n such functions is denoted by Bn. The sign function of f is defined as F(x) = ( - 1)f(x). The Walsh-Hadamard(WHT) transform Wf(u) of the Boolean function f, evaluated in a point u of the domain [formula] is defined as [formula] Alternatively, in matrix terms, if F is viewed as a column vector the matrix of the WHT is the Hadamard matrix Hn of Sylvester type, which we now define by tensor products. Let

[formula]

Let [formula] be the n-fold tensor product of H with itself and [formula] its normalized version. Recall the Hadamard property

[formula]

where we denote by IM the M by M identity matrix. With these notations Wf(u) = HnF. A function f∈Bn, is said to be bent if Wf(u) =   ±  2n / 2 for all [formula] By integrality reasons such functions only exist for even n. If f is bent its dual function is defined as that element [formula] of Bn such that its sign function, henceforth denoted by , satisfies [formula]. If, furthermore, f = , then f is self-dual bent [\cite=CDPS]. Similarly, if f =  + 1 then f is anti-self-dual bent[\cite=CDPS]. Thus if f is self-dual bent its sign function is an eigenvector of Hn associated to the eigenvalue 2n / 2. Likewise, if f is anti self-dual bent its sign function is an eigenvector of Hn associated to the eigenvalue - 2n / 2.

Generalized bent functions

A generalized Boolean function(gBF) in n variables is any function from [formula] to [formula] for some integer q. In this work we shall focus on the case q = 2m, for some integer m > 1. The set of all such gBFs will be denoted by GBn. The (complex) sign function of f is defined as F(x) = (ω)f(x), where ω stands for a complex root of unity of order 2m. The Walsh-Hadamard transform Hf(u) of the Boolean function f, evaluated in a point u of the domain [formula] is defined as [formula] In matrix terms Hf(u) = HnF. A function f∈GBn, is said to be bent if |Hf(u)| = 2n / 2 for all [formula] A bent gBF is said to be regular if there is an element [formula] of Qn, such that its sign function satisfies Hf(u) = 2n / 2. If, furthermore, f = , then f is self-dual bent. Similarly, if f =  + 2m - 1, then f is anti-self-dual bent.

Decomposition

By standard facts on cyclotomic polynomials, we know that the degree of ω over the rationals is k = 2m - 1.

Definition: A system of 2s boolean functions [formula] with respective sign functions [formula] is said to have the Hadamard property if

[formula]

is equal to ±   some column of Hs. For instance, the condition is automatically verified for s = 1. It becomes non trivial as soon as the possible number of columns of length 2s, that is 22s exceeds twice the number of columns of Hs that is 2s + 1. The latter condition is equivalent to s > 1.

If the sign function of the regular bent gBF f is [formula] then the k BF Gi for [formula] defined by

[formula]

are bent BF with the Hadamard property, and so is the system of their duals. Conversely, given k BF [formula] with the Hadamard property, with duals also with Hadamard property, the gBF of sign function [formula] with the ai's are defined by the above system is regular bent.

There is no regular bent [formula]-valued gBF in odd number of variables.

We now specialize this decomposition to the case of self-dual gBFs and self-dual BFs. Note that self-dual gBFs are regular.

If the sign function of the self-dual bent gBF f is [formula] then the k self-dual BFs Gi for [formula] defined by

[formula]

are bent BF with the Hadamard property. Conversely, given k BF [formula] with the Hadamard property,the gBF of sign function [formula] where the ai's are defined by the above system is self-dual bent.

Classification

In this section, we classify all quaternary regular bent functions (q = 4), of degree at most 4, under the action of the extended affine group. The equivalence of two regular bent functions is defined as follows.

Let f be a quaternary regular bent function in n variables. Then g(x) = f(xM + a) + c, where M∈GL(n,2), [formula] and [formula] is also regular bent.

Remark: Two functions f and g defined in Proposition [\ref=prop:equiv] are said to be affinely equivalent. It is well known that two binary bent functions are EA-equivalent if g(x) = f(xM + a) + bx + c, where M∈GL(n,2), [formula] and [formula]. However for our quaternary regular bent functions, there is only restricted EA-equivalence, that is, b = 0.

By applying our decomposition technique of Theorem [\ref=theo:dec1], we can now classify all quaternary regular bent functions upto four variables and we give all representatives in Table 1 below.

Up to affine equivalence, there are 2,7 non-equivalent quaternary regular bent functions in 2,4. The number of quaternary reqular bent functions is the square of that of binary case and more precisely there are 82,8962,(3502  ×  13888)2 in 2,4,6 variables respectively.

Conclusion

In this article we have decomposed bent generalized Boolean functions with values in [formula] as a function of certain systems of 2m - 1 bent Boolean functions. The natural question that arises would be to replace [formula] by [formula] for odd p, or even [formula] for an arbitrary q. However, in these cases, the condition of Hadamard type seems to be never satisfied in view of the existence of power of ω that more than one nonzero component on the basis of [formula] For instance, if q = 6, we have ω2  =  ω - 1, when a basis of [formula] is {1,ω}.
