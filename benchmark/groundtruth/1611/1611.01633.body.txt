Characterizations of centralizers and derivations on some algebras

Introduction

Let A be an associative algebra over the complex field [formula], and φ be a linear mapping from A into itself. φ is called a centralizer if φ(AB) = φ(A)B = Aφ(B) for each A and B in A. Obviously, if A is an algebra with unit I, then φ is a centralizer if and only if φ(A) = φ(I)A = Aφ(I) for every A in A. φ is called a derivation if φ(AB) = φ(A)B + Aφ(B) for each A and B in A.

A linear mapping φ:A  →  A is called a centralizable mapping at G∈A if φ(AB) = φ(A)B = Aφ(B) for each A and B in A with AB = G, and φ is called a derivable mapping at G∈A if φ(AB) = φ(A)B + Aφ(B) for each A and B in A with AB = G. An element G in A is called a full-centralizable point (resp. full-derivable point) if every centralizable (resp. derivable) mapping at G is a centralizer (resp. derivation).

In [\cite=501], Brear proves that if R is a prime ring with a nontrival idempotent, then 0 is a full-centralizable point. In [\cite=502], X. Qi and J. Hou characterize centralizable and derivable mappings at 0 in triangular algebras. In [\cite=503], X. Qi proves that every nontrival idempotent in a prime ring is a full-centralizable point. In [\cite=519], W. Xu, R. An and J. Hou prove that every element in B(H) is a full-centralizable point, where H is a Hilbert space. For more information on centralizable and derivable mappings, we refer to [\cite=509] [\cite=505] [\cite=506] [\cite=508] [\cite=504] [\cite=507].

For a von Neumann algebra A, the central carrier C(A) of an element A in A is the projection I - P, where P is the union of all central projections Pα in A such that PαA = 0.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, by using the techniques about central carriers, we show that every element in a von Neumann algebra is a full-centralizable point.

Let A and B be two unital algebras over the complex field [formula], and M be a unital (A,B)-bimodule which is faithful both as a left A-module and a right B-module. The algebra

[formula]

under the usual matrix addition and matrix multiplication is called a triangular algebra.

In Section 3, we show that if A and B are two unital Banach algebras, then every element in Tri(A,M,B) is a full-centralizable point.

In Section 4, we show that for every point G in a von Neumann algebra A, if Δ is a derivable mapping at G, then Δ = D + φ, where D:A  →  A is a derivation and φ:A  →  A is a centralizer. Moreover, we prove that G is a full-derivable point if and only if C(G) = I.

Centralizers on von Neumann algebras

In this section, A denotes a unital algebra and φ:A  →  A is a centralizable mapping at a given point G∈A. The main result is the following theorem.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space H. Then every element G in A is a full-centralizable point.

Before proving Theorem 2.1, we need the following several lemmas.

Let A be a unital Banach algebra with the form [formula]. Then φ(Ai)  ⊆  Ai. Moreover, suppose [formula], where Gi∈Ai. If Gi is a full-centralizable point in Ai for every i∈Λ, then G is a full-centralizable point in A.

Let Ii be the unit in Ai. Suppose that Ai is an invertible element in Ai, and t is an arbitrary nonzero element in [formula]. It is easy to check that

[formula]

So we have

[formula]

Considering the coefficient of t, since t is arbitrarily chosen, we have (I - Ii)φ(Ai) = 0. It follows that φ(Ai) = Iiφ(Ai)∈Ai for all invertible elements. Since Ai is a Banach algebra, every element can be written into the sum of two invertible elements. So the above equation holds for all elements in Ai. That is to say φ(Ai)  ⊆  Ai.

Let φi  =  φ|Ai. For every A in A, we write [formula]. Assume AB = G. Since AiBi = Gi and φ(Ai)  ⊆  Ai, we have

[formula]

It implies that φi(Gi) = φi(Ai)Bi. Similarly, we can obtain φi(Gi) = Aiφi(Bi). By assumption, Gi is a full-centralizable point, so φi is a centralizer. Hence

[formula]

Similarly, we can prove φ(A) = Aφ(I). Hence G is a full-centralizable point.

Let A be a C*-algebra. If G* is a full-centralizable point in A, then G is a full-centralizable point in A.

Define a linear mapping [formula] by: [formula] for every A in A. For each A and B in A with AB = G*, we have B*A* = G. It follows that φ(G) = φ(B*)A* = B*φ(A*). By the definition of [formula], we obtain [formula]. Since G* is a full-centralizable point in A, we have that [formula] is a centralizer. Thus φ is also a centralizer. Hence G is a full-centralizable point in A.

For a unital algebra A and a unital A-bimodule M, an element A∈A is called a left separating point (resp. right separating point) of M if AM = 0 implies M = 0 (MA = 0 implies M = 0) for every M∈M.

Let A be a unital Banach algebra and G be a left and right separating point in A. Then G is a full-centralizable point.

For every invertible element X in A, we have

[formula]

Since G is a right separating point, we obtain φ(I) = φ(X)X- 1. It follows that φ(X) = φ(I)X for each invertible element X and so for all elements in A. Similarly, we have that φ(X) = Xφ(I). Hence G is a full-centralizable point.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra. Then G = 0 is a full-centralizable point.

For any projection P in A, since P(I - P) = (I - P)P = 0, we have

[formula]

It follows that φ(P) = φ(I)P = Pφ(I). By [\cite=515] and [\cite=516], we know that φ is continuous. Since [formula], it follows that φ(A) = φ(I)A = Aφ(I) for every A∈A. Hence G is a full-centralizable point.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space H and P be the range projection of G . If C(P) = C(I - P) = I, then G is a full-centralizable point.

Set P1 = P, ~ P2 = I - P, and denote PiAPj by Aij, i,j = 1,2. For every A in A, denote PiAPj by Aij.

Firstly, we claim that the condition AAij = 0 implies APi = 0, and similarly, AijA = 0 implies PjA = 0. Indeed, since C(Pj) = I, by [\cite=514], the range of APj is dense in H. So APiAPj = 0 implies APi = 0. On the other hand, if AijA = 0, then A*Aji = 0. Hence A*Pj = 0 and PjA = 0.

Besides, since P1 = P is the range projection of G, we have P1G = G. Moreover, if AG = 0, then AP1 = 0.

In the following, we assume that Aij is an arbitrary element in Aij, i,j = 1,2, and t is an arbitrary nonzero element in [formula]. Without loss of generality, we may assume that A11 is invertible in A11.

Claim 1 φ(A12)  ⊆  A12.

Since (P1 + tA12)G = G, we have φ(G) = φ(P1 + tA12)G. It implies that φ(A12)G = 0. Hence φ(A12)P1 = 0.

By (P1 + tA12)G = G, we also have φ(G) = (P1 + tA12)φ(G). It follows that A12φ(G) = A12φ(P1)G = 0. So A12φ(P1)P1 = 0. Hence P2φ(P1)P1 = 0.

Since (A11 + tA11A12)(A- 111G - A12A22 + t- 1A22) = G, we have

[formula]

Since t is arbitrarily chosen in [\eqref=203], we obtain

[formula]

Since A12 is also arbitrarily chosen, we can obtain φ(A11)A12A22  =  φ(A11A12)A22. Taking A22 = P2, since φ(A12)P1 = 0, we have

[formula]

Taking A11 = P1, since P2φ(P1)P1 = 0, we have

[formula]

So

[formula]

Claim 2 φ(A11)  ⊆  A11.

Considering the coefficient of t- 1 in [\eqref=203], we have φ(A11)A22 = 0. Thus φ(A11)P2 = 0. By [\eqref=205], we obtain P2φ(A11)A12 = P2φ(A11A12) = 0. It follows that P2φ(A11)P1 = 0. Therefore, φ(A11) = P1φ(A11)P1  ⊆  A11.

Claim 3 φ(A22)  ⊆  A22.

By (A11 + tA11A12)(A- 111G - A12A22 + t- 1A22) = G, we also have

[formula]

Through a similar discussion to equation [\eqref=203], we can prove P1φ(A22) = 0 and

[formula]

Thus A12φ(A22)P1  =  φ(A12A22)P1 = 0. It follows that P2φ(A22)P1 = 0. Therefore, φ(A22) = P2φ(A22)P2  ⊆  A22.

Claim 4 φ(A21)  ⊆  A21.

Since (A11 + tA11A12)(A- 111G - A12A21 + t- 1A21) = G, we have

[formula]

According to this equation, we can similarly obtain that P1φ(A21) = 0 and

[formula]

Hence A12φ(A21)P2  =  φ(A12A21)P2 = 0. It follows that P2φ(A21)P2 = 0. Therefore, φ(A21) = P2φ(A21)P1  ⊆  A21.

Claim 5 φ(Aij) = φ(Pi)Aij = Aijφ(Pj) for each i,j∈{1,2}.

By taking A11 = P1 in [\eqref=205], we have φ(A12) = φ(P1)A12. By taking A22 = P2 in [\eqref=211], we have φ(A12) = A12φ(P2).

By [\eqref=205], we have φ(A11)A12  =  φ(A11A12) = φ(P1)A11A12. It follows that φ(A11) = φ(P1)A11. On the other hand, φ(A11)A12  =  φ(A11A12) = A11A12φ(P2) = A11φ(A12) = A11φ(P1)A12. It follows that φ(A11) = A11φ(P1).

By [\eqref=211] and [\eqref=219], through a similar discussion as above, we can obtain that φ(A22) = A22φ(P2) = φ(P2)A22 and φ(A21) = A21φ(P1) = φ(P2)A21.

Now we have proved that φ(Aij)  ⊆  Aij and φ(Aij) = φ(Pi)Aij = Aijφ(Pj). It follows that

[formula]

Similarly, we can prove that φ(A) = Aφ(I). Hence G is a full-centralizable point.

Suppose the range projection of G is P. Set Q1 = I - C(I - P), Q2 = I - C(P), and Q3 = I - Q1 - Q2. Since Q1  ≤  P and Q2  ≤  I - P, {Qi}i = 1,2,3 are mutually orthogonal central projections. Therefore [formula]. Obviously, Ai is also a von Neumann algebra acting on QiH. For each element A in A, we write [formula].

We divide our proof into two cases. Case 1 ker(G) = {0}

Since Q1  ≤  P, we have [formula]. Since G is injective on H, G1 = Q1G is also injective on Q1H. Hence G1 is a separating point(both right and left) in A1. By Lemma 2.4, G1 is a full-centralizable point in A1.

Since Q2  ≤  I - P, we have G2 = Q2G = 0. By Lemma 2.5, G2 is a full-centralizable point in A2.

Note that [formula]. Denote the central carrier of P3 in A3 by CA3(P3). We have Q3  -  CA3(P3)  ≤  Q3 - P3 = Q3(I - P)  ≤  I - P. Obviously, Q3  -  CA3(P3) is a central projection orthogonal to Q2, so Q3  -  CA3(P3) + I - C(P)  ≤  I - P. That is Q3  -  CA3(P3) + P  ≤  C(P). It implies that Q3  -  CA3(P3) = 0, i.e. CA3(P3) = Q3. Similarly, we can prove CA3(Q3 - P3) = Q3. By Lemma 2.6, G3 is a full-centralizable point in A3.

By Lemma 2.2, G is a full-centralizable point. Case 2 ker(G)  ≠  {0}

In this case, G2 and G3 are still full-centralizable points. Since [formula] , we have ker(G*1) = {0}. By Case 1, G*1 is a full-centralizable point in A1. By Lemma 2.3, G1 is also a full-centralizable point in A1.

By Lemma 2.2, G is a full-centralizable point.

Centralizers on triangular algebras

In this section, we characterize the full-centralizable points on triangular algebras. The following theorem is our main result.

Let [formula] be a triangular algebra, where A and B are two unital Banach algebras. Then every G in J is a full-centralizable point.

Let φ:J  →  J be a centralizable mapping at G.

Since φ is linear, for every [formula] in J, we write

[formula]

where f11:A  →  A, ~ f12:A  →  M, ~ f22:A  →  B, ~ g11:M  →  A, ~ g12:M  →  M, g22:M  →  B, ~ h11:B  →  A, ~ h12:B  →  M, ~ h22:B  →  B, are all linear mappings.

In the following, we denote the units of A and B by I1 and I2, respectively. We write [formula] and

[formula]

We divide our proof into several steps.

Claim 1 f12 = f22 = 0.

Let [formula] and [formula], where X is an invertible element in A. Since ST = G, we have

[formula]

By comparing [\eqref=301] with [\eqref=302], we obtain f12(X) = f12(A) and f22(X) = f22(A) for each invertible element X in A. Noting that A is a fixed element, for any nonzero element λ in [formula], we have f12(λX) = f12(A) = λf12(X) = λf12(A). It follows that f12(X) = 0 for each invertible element X. Thus f12(X) = 0 for all X in A. Similarly, we can obtain f22(X) = 0.

Claim 2 h12 = h11 = 0.

Let [formula] and [formula], where Z is an invertible element in B. Since ST = G, we have

[formula]

By comparing [\eqref=301] with [\eqref=303], we obtain h12(Z) = h12(B) and h11(Z) = h11(B) for each invertible element Z in B. Similarly as the previous discussion, we can obtain h12(Z) = h11(Z) = 0 for all Z in B.

Claim 3 g22 = g11 = 0.

For every Y in M, we set [formula], [formula]. Obviously, ST = G. Thus we have

[formula]

By comparing [\eqref=301] with [\eqref=304], we obtain f22(I1) + g22(M - Y) + h22(B) = f22(A) + g22(M) + h22(B). Hence g22(Y) = f22(I1 - A). It means g22(Y) = 0 immediately.

On the other hand,

[formula]

By comparing [\eqref=301] with [\eqref=305], we obtain g11(Y) = g11(M) + h11(B - I2). Hence g11(Y) = 0.

According to the above three claims, we obtain that

[formula]

for every [formula] in J.

Claim 4 f11(X) = f11(I1)X for all X in A, and g12(Y) = f11(I1)Y for all Y in M.

Let [formula] and [formula], where X is an invertible element in A, and Y is an arbitrary element in M. Since ST = G, we have

[formula]

So we have f11(X)Y = g12(XY). It follows that

[formula]

by taking X = I1. Replacing Y in [\eqref=307] with XY, we can obtain g12(XY) = f11(I1)XY = f11(X)Y for each invertible element X in A and Y in M. Since M is faithful, we have

[formula]

for all invertible elements X and so for all elements in A.

Claim 5 h22(Z) = Zh22(I2) for all Z in B, and g12(Y) = Yh22(I2) for all Y in M.

Let [formula] and [formula], where Z is an invertible element in B, and Y is an arbitrary element in M. Since ST = G, we have

[formula]

So we have g12(YZ) = Yh22(Z). Through a similar discussion as the proof of Claim 4, we obtain h22(Z) = Zh22(I2) for all Z in B and g12(Y) = Yh22(I2) for all Y in M.

Thus we have that

[formula]

for every [formula] in J. So it is sufficient to show that f11(I1)X = Xf11(I1) for all X in A, and h22(I2)Z = Zh22(I2) for all Z in B. Since f11(I1)Y = Yh22(I2) for all Y in M, we have f11(I1)XY = XYh22(I2) = Xf11(I1)Y. It implies that f11(I1)X = Xf11(I1). Similarly, h22(I2)Z = Zh22(I2). Now we can obtain that φ(J) = φ(I)J = Jφ(I) for all J in J, where [formula] is the unit of J. Hence, G is a full-centralizable point.

As applications of Theorem 3.1, we have the following corollaries.

Let A be a nest algebra on a Hilbert space H. Then every element in A is a full-centralizable point.

If A = B(H), then the result follows from Theorem 2.1. Otherwise, A is isomorphic to a triangular algebra. By Theorem 3.1, the result follows.

Let A be a CDCSL(completely distributive commutative subspace lattice) algebra on a Hilbert space H. Then every element in A is a full-centralizable point.

It is known that [formula], where each Ai is either B(Hi) for some Hilbert space Hi or a triangular algebra Tri(B,M,C) such that the conditions of Theorem 3.1 hold(see in [\cite=517] and [\cite=518]). By Lemma 2.2, the result follows.

Remark For the definition of a CDCSL algebra, we refer to [\cite=521].

Derivations on von Neumann algebras

In this section, we characterize the derivable mappings at a given point in a von Neumann algebra.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra. Suppose Δ:A  →  A is a linear mapping such that Δ(A)B + AΔ(B) = 0 for each A and B in A with AB = 0. Then Δ = D + φ, where D:A  →  A is a derivation, and φ:A  →  A is a centralizer. In particular, Δ is bounded.

Case 1 A is an abelian von Neumann algebra. In this case, [formula] for some compact Hausdorff space X. If AB = 0, then the supports of A and B are disjoint. So the equation Δ(A)B + AΔ(B) = 0 implies that Δ(A)B = AΔ(B) = 0. By Lemma 2.5, Δ is a centralizer.

Case 2 [formula], where B is also a von Neumann algebra. By [\cite=513], Δ is a generalized derivation with Δ(I) in the center. That is to say, Δ is a sum of a derivation and a centralizer.

For general cases, we know [formula], where each Ai coincides with either Case 1 or Case 2. We write [formula] with Ai∈Ai and denote the restriction of Δ in Ai by Δi. It is not difficult to check that Δ(Ai)∈Ai. Moreover, setting AiBi = 0, we have Δ(Ai)Bi + AiΔ(Bi) = Δi(Ai)Bi + AiΔi(Bi) = 0. By Case 1 and Case 2, each Δi is a sum of a derivation and a centralizer. Hence, [formula] is a sum of a derivation and a centralizer.

Remark In [\cite=520], the authors prove that for a prime semisimple Banach algebra A with nontrival idempotents and a linear mapping Δ from A into itself, the condition Δ(A)B + AΔ(B) = 0 for each A and B in A with AB = 0 implies that Δ is bounded. By Lemma 4.1, we have that for a von Neumann algebra A, the result holds still even if A is not prime.

Now we prove our main result in this section.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space H, and G be a given point in A. If Δ:A  →  A is a linear mapping derivable at G, then Δ = D + φ, where D is a derivation, and φ is a centralizer. Moreover, G is a full-derivable point if and only if C(G) = I.

Suppose the range projection of G is P. We note that C(G) = C(P).

Set Q1 = I - C(I - P), Q2 = I - C(P), and Q3 = I - Q1 - Q2. Then we have [formula]. For every A in A, we write [formula].

For any central projection Q, setting [formula], we have

[formula]

where A is an arbitrary invertible element in A, and t is an arbitrary nonzero element in [formula]. So we obtain

[formula]

Considering the coefficient of t, we obtain [formula]. Since the ranges of Q and [formula] are disjoint, it follows that [formula] and so Δ(QA)∈QA. Since Qi are central projections, we have Δ(Ai)  ⊆  Ai.

Denote the restriction of Δ to Ai by Δi. Setting AiBi = Gi, it is not difficult to check that Δi(Gi) = Δ(Ai)Bi + AiΔ(Bi).

Since Q1  ≤  P, we have [formula]. So G1 is a right separating point in A1. By [\cite=512], Δ1 is a Jordan derivation and so is a derivation on A1.

Since Q2  ≤  I - P, we have G2 = Q2G = 0. By Lemma 4.1, Δ2 is a sum of a derivation and a centralizer on A2.

Note that [formula]. As we proved before, CA3(P3) = CA3(Q3 - P3) = Q3. So by [\cite=511], Δ3 is a derivation on A3.

Hence, [formula] is a sum of a derivation and a centralizer.

If C(G) = I, then Q2 = 0, [formula] and G = G1 + G3 is a full-derivable point. If C(G)  ≠  I, then [formula]. Define a linear mapping δ:A  →  A by δ(A) = A2 for all A∈A. One can check that δ is not a derivation but derivable at G. Thus G is not a full-derivable point.

As an application, we obtain the following corollary.

Let A be a von Neumann algebra. Then A is a factor if and only if every nonzero element G in A is a full-derivable point.

If A is a factor, for each nonzero element G in A, we know that C(G) = I. By Theorem 4.2, G is a full-derivable point.

If A is not a factor, then there exists a nontrival central projection P. Define a linear mapping δ:A  →  A by δ(A) = (I - P)A for all A∈A. One can check that δ is not a derivation but derivable at P. Thus P is not a full-derivable point.
