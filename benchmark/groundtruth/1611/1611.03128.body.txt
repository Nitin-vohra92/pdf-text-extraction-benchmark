Introduction

Since their first detection in 1995 [\citep=mayor], the origin of Hot Jupiters has been covered with mysteries. These were first thought to originate beyond the water iceline were solid material is abundant enough for their massive cores to form via classical planetesimals accretion [\citep=pollack1996], then migrate inward via either disk migration [\citep=goldreich] [\citep=ward] [\citep=kley2012] or high eccentricity migration [\citep=rasio] [\citep=wu]. This paradigm got challenged recently with many new theoretical and observational advancements. First, pebbles accretion was introduced as a very efficient mechanism for cores formation [\citep=lamb2], opening a new possibility to form these even inside the water snowline. Second, newly found extreme planetary systems similar to WASP 47 [\citep=wasp471] [\citep=wasp472] with a very fragile architecture (non hierarchical tightly packed multiple massive planets including a Hot Jupiter) puts into question any migration scenario for these systems, since this would probably destabilize them. For these reasons, the possibility of in-situ formation some of these planets has been recently invoked [\citep=hjin1] [\citep=hjin2]. This hypothesis however suffers from its own problems. First and for all it is still unclear what would stop the planets forming in-situ from spiraling into the central star, but this is a problem faced also by planets forming just beyond the snowline. The other problem for in-situ Hot Jupiters formation is their still relatively long formation timescale in this region where pebbles are smaller and the very high atmospheric temperature along with the low opacity, severely increasing the contraction timescale for their envelopes. For all these reasons, an observational method or criteria should be developed and used to disentangle between these very different formation scenarios. The carbon and oxygen chemical abundances, and their C/O ratio, have long been proposed as tracers for planets formation processes from both theoretical ([\cite=oberg] [\cite=madhu2] [\cite=ali-dibb] [\cite=alibert1] [\cite=morda2016]) and observational [\citep=madhu1] [\citep=kreid1] [\citep=kreid2] [\citep=steve] [\citep=line] point of views (we refer the readers to [\citep=madhu3] for a recent review on both aspects). These species are present throughout the disk in partly volatile phases that condense when temperatures are low enough, allowing cores forming beyond a certain element's snowline to be rich in the said element. Linking the chemical composition of a giant planet to its formation location and mechanism is tricky though since a large number of processes are at play. A global model incorporating simplified versions of these processes is hence needed to quantify the chemical composition of a giant planet as a function of its initial formation conditions, which is the subject of this work. The questions we will try to answer are:

Can planetary seeds inside the water snowline grow into Jupiter mass planets before the dissipation of the disk ?

Can Hot Jupiters forming in situ be distinguished from those who migrated from outside the snowline via their chemical composition ?

How sensitive is the planet's chemistry to the disk's, and what is the best formation chemical tracer ?

What is the effect of the formation location on the total mass of heavy elements in the planet ?

In section 2 we introduce the model we use to connect the planet's chemistry to its formation. In section 3 we present the results and we conclude in section 4.

Model

The model we use in this work is similar to the one used in [\cite=ali-dibc], based on [\cite=lamb1] [\cite=lamb3] [\cite=bitsch1] [\cite=bitsch2]. This model includes the following:

Fits to a 2D disk model with accurate opacities and radiative treatment, but not viscous evolution. The opacity model is important for its effects on the thermal structure of the disk and thus migration.

Parametric pebbles & gas accretion. Pebbles accretion is much more efficient in forming planetary cores than the classical planetesimals accretion, with the pebbles size and surface density being the fundamental parameters. The gas accretion depend dominantly on the envelope's opacity, density and temperature, in addition to the core's mass.

Type I and II migration through torques evaluation. Type I migration will affect low mass planets through the Lindblad and corotation torques, while type II migration will affect planets massive enough to open a gap in disk and follow its viscous evolution. We assume that the planets inward migration will stop at the inner cavity, and hence won't be lost to the star. Disk migration is implemented in all simulations, so when discussing Hot-Jupiters forming "in-situ", we mean inside of the water snowline.

The model tracks the carbon and oxygen abundances of the forming planet. These elements are each divided into refractory and volatiles phases. The refractory phase is solid at all temperatures, and the volatile part is in ice phase only outside of the snowline. We assume that all carbon and oxygen are in water and CO (or CO2). The refractory to volatile ratio is a free adjustable parameter. We study a solar system refractory/volatile ratio case in addition to a purely volatile case.

A planet's core can get eroded, polluting its envelope with the heavy elements of this core. We treat the core's erosion through a free parameter ranging from 0% (no core erosion) to 100% (full core erosion).

Simulations are stopped when either the disk fully disperse, a Jupiter mass planet is reached, or when the planet reach the inner edge of our disk at 0.025 AU.

For a more detailed description of the model we refer the reader to [\cite=ali-dibc] and the references therein. However, the model in [\cite=ali-dibc] was developed primarily with the solar system's giant planets in mind. Modifications should be made to account for the differences related to hot-Jupiters. If hot-Jupiters formed in-situ (inside the water snowline), their initial planetary seeds would have encountered a pebbles disk structure significantly different than beyond the snowline. As [\cite=morby1] have noted, the pebbles inward flux might be 2 times lower inside the snowline, with the pebbles characteristic size an order of magnitude smaller. We take this into account by artificially lowering the mass flux and pebbles characteristic size inside the water snowline by these factors. We however continue to use the pebbles isolation mass calculated by [\cite=lamb1] that does not take these effects into account, and hence this is a caveat in this work.

Such a global model usually include a large number of free parameters. To keep the problem tractable, we only vary the parameters that are assumed to affect directly the planet's chemical compositions, shown in table [\ref=t1]. The free parameters space is explored through population synthesis.

Results & Discussions

Analytical discussion & global properties

Even though numerical simulations are needed to extract precise quantitative predictions from the model, its basic aspects can be understood from simple arguments. The model takes into account two possible sources for carbon and oxygen: the eroded core and the envelope. During the envelope's hydrodynamical collapse, the disk's gas along with the coupled dust will be accreted, leading to a necessarily stellar C/O ratio (assuming that any dust accreted with the envelope will sublimate and mix with the hot gaseous envelope.) even if this quantity has evolved in the separate gas and solid phases [\citep=oberg]. The source for any deviation in the planet's C/O ratio from the stellar value should hence originate from the partially or completely eroded core. Therefore if the core has a stellar C/O ratio, the bulk observable planet's value will remain intact. If on the other hand the core had a super or substellar C/O ratio, then (assuming significant core erosion) the envelope's C/O will follow in the same direction. The core C/O depend on two quantities: the amount of accreted volatile ices and the amount of accreted refractory species. A superstellar C/O ratio cannot be achieved from purely volatile ices, simply because the CO and CO2 icelines are both further out in the disk than the water's snowline. There is hence no way for a core to accrete more C-bearing ices than water ices (in the framework of the classical core accretion scenario, but cf. [\cite=ali-dibb]). A planet accreting volatiles ices as the unique source of C and O will hence have strictly stellar or substellar C/O ratios. We can conclude therefore that an important refractory carbonaceous component is necessary for a hot Jupiter to have a superstellar C/O ratio. This is however not the only constraint. For this to happen, the planet also necessary need to accrete more carbon than oxygen, and since all refractories are solid at all temperatures, the only way for a planet to obtain this superstellar C/O ratio is for the refractory dust to be more rich in carbon than oxygen. In other words, the relative abundance of carbon in dust with respect to the stellar carbon abundance should be higher than the water's refractory/volatile relative abundance. This seems to be the case in our own solar system from Halley's in situ measurements [\citep=jessberger1988], even though this is not settled. Figure [\ref=fig:alljups] shows the population of all "Jupiters" (defined as 100 M[formula] ≤   M ≤   320 M[formula]) found in the simulations. It shows the final positions of the planets as a function of the seeds initial placement and injection time into the disk. We can find in this population cold, warm and hot Jupiters. More interestingly, we find a population of Hot Jupiters who form in the inner most parts of the disk ("in situ"). We notice that all of the Hot Jupiters parked at the inner most edge of the disk and who started forming inside the snowline have started forming very early in the disk (2.5×   105 yr). This is expected since only that early in the disk's lifetime the seed will have time to grow large via the slow Bondi regime to start accreting pebbles in the much faster Hill regime. Additionally, only in young disks the pebbles isolation mass is high enough to allow the formation of a core massive enough to contract an atmosphere before the dissipation of the disk. This shows that the formation of Hot Jupiters "in situ" under the multiple assumptions present in the model is possible, but it should take place very early in the disk. However, again by looking at Figure [\ref=fig:alljups], we notice that most of the Hot-Jupiters found by this model started forming in the outer disk. So while it is possible to form Hot-Jupiters in situ, it is much easier and more efficient to form them starting in the outer disk.

Case: solar chemistry

We first set a solar C/O ratio with solar refractory/volatile ratios. Figure [\ref=fig:jup1] show the C/O ratios of Hot Jupiters resulting from the population synthesis as a function of their seed's initial injection place and time, and for different core erosion factors. For a Hot Jupiter forming between the water and CO icelines, the core will be made from both refractory and icy oxygen phases, but only refractory carbon. In this case, with core erosion, more oxygen will get ceded into the envelope than carbon, and thus the erosion will slightly decrease the planet's C/O ratio (because both carbon and oxygen in this case have very abundant refractory phases). If however the planet's core formed mainly beyond the CO iceline, then it will be accreting all of the chemical species in solid phase, and hence will maintain its solar C/O ratio. The envelope will hence maintain its C/O ratio no matter the amount of core erosion. In the third case where the planet forms entirely inside the water's snowline, then its C/O ratio will depend on the amount of these species present in refractory dust. Since in our case there is more carbon refractories than oxygen refractories, the planet's C/O will increase. All these different cases can be seen in Figure [\ref=fig:jup1], where we find that planets forming inside the water snowline have C/O ratio up to 0.8, while these who formed between the two snowlines have a slightly subsolar C/O of around 0.45, and finally the planets who formed all the way far out beyond the CO iceline have solar C/O value. Figure [\ref=fig:mznope] shows the total mass of heavy elements in the hot Jupiter (MZ) as a function of their seed's initial injection place and time. The values we find are in line with the indirect retrieval method of [\cite=thorn]. Planets forming earlier and further out in the disk have higher isolation masses and thus higher MZ. We note however the degeneracy between injection place and time, making this criteria on its own unconstraining. It needs to be coupled to a chemical abundance measurement for useful informations on a planet's history. Figure [\ref=fig:cmz] shows the planet's bulk carbon enrichment as a function of MZ, where a linear correlation is seen between the two observables. A carbon abundance measurement can hence be used to constrain MZ, or the other way around. The values retrieved using this method should be considered lower limits however due to the uncertainty on the core erosion factors in Hot Jupiters and the amount of carbon in refractories. This is in analogy with [\cite=ali-dibc] method of constraining MZ and the core masses of Jupiter and Saturn from sulfur and phosphorus observations. The oxygen abundance however (and hence the C/O ratio) cannot be used to constrain MZ due to the degeneracy in the values of MZ between early planets forming inside the iceline and the late planets forming far outside of the iceline. This can be seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:omz] showing the normalized abundance of oxygen as a function of the total mass of heavy elements in the planet. Two separate trends can be seen, the upper branch corresponding the Hot Jupiters forming from outside of snowline through migration, and the lower branch with a shallower correlation corresponding to the "in situ" Hot Jupiters not accreting water ice, but only oxygen in refractories.

Case: pure volatiles

We now run simulations with all elements in the purely volatile phase (no carbon or oxygen in refractories). The final C/O distribution should hence be even more dependent on the initial position of the planet since the total amount of accreted carbon and oxygen will depend entirely on the planet's position with respect to the snowlines. The results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:noref]. We notice that the obtained planets follow a broad distribution where planets forming inside the water snowline and outside of the CO's iceline have solar C/O while those forming in between show much lower values depending on the amount of ices accreted. This is understandable since only between the two icelines oxygen fractionates (in different physical phase) from carbon. In this case however The C/O can be as low as 0.1 for planets that did not accrete any CO ices while accreting important amount of water ices, leading to a slightly steeper distribution trend. This case however is for illustration only. It is unlikely that a disk can exist with purely volatile phases. We know from small bodies observations that this was far from the reality in our own protosolar nebula, and observations in TW Hya and HL Tau show a strong depletion in CO with respect to the canonical value, hinting toward the CO transforming into other elements, either CO2 or refractories [\citep=co1] [\citep=co2] [\citep=co4]. We explore this in Fig. [\ref=fig:co2] showing the results from simulations where all of the carbon is in CO2. In this case, similar to the CO case, all planets forming inside the water iceline or outside of the CO2 iceline will maintain solar C/O ratio, while only planets forming between these two will deviate. Interestingly, since CO2 condense at significantly higher temperatures than CO, the CO2 iceline can move significantly inward to the inner disk during the disk's lifetime. Hence planets who form outside of this iceline (hence maintain the solar C/O ratio) late enough will be located in the inner most parts of the disk.

Case: High stellar C/O ratio

Ultimately, the fundamental parameter affecting the planets chemistry is the host star's C/O ratio (imprinted onto the disk). Multiple surveys studied the distribution of the stellar population C/O ratios [\citep=stellar1] [\citep=stellar2] [\citep=stellar3] [\citep=brewer]. These works concluded that planets hosting stars C/O ratios cluster around the solar (0.55) value, and very few stars (if any) have C/O larger than 0.8. Interestingly, this is the value beyond which the carbon and oxygen chemistry will start changing dramatically, where (at high temperatures) CH4 will replace CO as the most stable carbon bearing specie [\citep=madhu2]. Since most stars seem to have a C/O ratio below this value, this phenomenon is not expected to take place in these systems. Therefore, we can test the effect of high stellar C/O ratio on the chemical compositions of Hot-Jupiters using our model for stars with C/O up to 0.8 without modifying the chemistry of the disk. Results are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:jup2] for stellar C/O=0.8 and solar nebula refractory/volatile ratio. Since the chemistry of this system should be the same as in the solar C/O ratio case, the resulting planetary population distribution should be identical to that case, with the planets having higher C/O ratios scaled linearly by a factor of 1.45, as seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:jup2]. The most interesting population in this case is the Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ (inside the water snowline), with significant (≥   60%) core erosion. We can notice that these planets have a C/O ratio of higher than or equal to unity. This is the only population found in this work with C/O ratios higher than 0.9, and thus are expected to have a drastically different atmospheric chemistry, making them easily distinguishable with the next generation of telescopes.

Effects of the envelope's opacity

Now we study the effect of the envelope's opacity κenv on the C/O distribution of Hot Jupiters. The main effect of the κenv is to regulate the cooling ratio of the planet during the slow gas accretion phase, allowing it to contract more gas. Higher opacities will slow down the cooling rate and hence increase the time needed by the planet to reach the final fast hydrodynamical collapse phase where it transforms into a Jupiter mass planet. We hence run simulations with carbon and oxygen in purely volatile phases (with carbon in CO) but with κenv = 0.15 (a factor 3 higher than for our nominal cases). The results are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:noref2]. The difference between the cases with low and high envelope opacities are subtle. We notice that indeed higher κenv will slow down the giant planets formation as seen from the significantly lower number of Hot-Jupiters formed in this case (specially inside the water iceline where only a handful of Jupiters can now form in-situ). The general distribution trend however remains the same.

Effects of Photoevaporation

Another mechanism that can affect the disks and planets chemistry is disk photoevaporation [\citep=guillot2006] [\citep=monga2015]. Photoevaporation is in nature hydrodynamical, and hence not sensitive to the chemical composition of the gas. Therefore both carbon and oxygen will probably be affected due to PE at the same rate. The C/O ratio should therefore remain unaltered by the PE in a simple model where the gaseous volatiles are maintained in the disk through trapping in ices. Disk PE however can alter the carbon abundance - core mass correlation discussed above [\citep=ali-dibc].

Summary & Conclusions

In this work we tried to link the chemical composition of Hot-Jupiters to their formation location using pebbles accretion based population synthesis model with simplified chemistry. Our results can be summarized as following:

Hot-Jupiters can form inside the water snowline via pebbles accretion if their seed is injected early enough in the disk. This channel is significantly less efficient than forming them outside of the snowline.

Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ (inside the water snowline) will mostly have a higher C/O ratio than those forming outside of the snowline via disk migration. The exact difference between the two scenarios however significantly depend on the carbon and oxygen disk chemistry and amount of solid core erosion. The C/O ratios will vary more drastically in disks with significant amounts of C and O in volatile forms, in contrast with the solar system composition case where the variations are mild.

The only possible channel to form a Hot-Jupiter with a C/O higher than unity is if the stellar's C/O ratio is around 0.8. The highest possible C/O ratio in the nominal solar system case is 0.75, and 0.55 in the purely volatiles case. Planets forming between the 2 icelines in the purely volatile case can have C/O ratio as low as 0.2.

Assuming the solar system chemistry case where most of the carbon is in refractories, the carbon abundance should correlate directly to the core mass in the Hot-Jupiters, and thus these two quantities can be used as a tracers for each other. Oxygen abundance however is degenerated for the same core mass value due to the two possible formation scenarios.
