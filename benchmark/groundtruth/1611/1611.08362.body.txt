Inverse Prediction of Potential Energy Surface via Thermodynamically Equilibrium Structure

Introduction

Let us consider a classical system, where total energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. In order to quantitatively describe macroscopic structure with structural degree of freedom of g, we introduce corresponding complete coordination of [formula] (orthonormality is not required here.) In crystalline solids, since the lifetime of a particular configuration is long enough to achieve vibrational equilibrium, canonical average of macroscopic structure along coordination hr, [formula], can be given by

[formula]

Here, β means [formula], d and s respectively denotes micrscopic state on phase and configuration space, and [formula] represents vibrational free energy on configuration s. Since the number of possible configuration s astronomically increases with increase of system size, direct determination of [formula] from first-principles calculation is far from practical, thus a variety of thermodynamic simulation have been performed to efficiently sample dominant microscopic states to determine [formula], such as Monte Carlo simulation with Metropolis algorism.[\cite=mc1] [\cite=mc2]

Basically, to predict macroscopic structure, one first prepares a set of multibody interaction between constituents (or altenatively, prepare PES itself, Ũj), then perform thermodynamic simulation. This corresponds to obtain partial information of map

[formula]

restricted to the prepared PES, Ũj. Here, [formula] and [formula] respectively denotes a set of PES and a set of macroscopic structure in equilibrium state. The problem to straightforwardly predict PES, Ũk, from measured structure of H̃k is that (i) map Γ is generally unknown from information about Ũj  ↦  H̃j for a restricted set of j, and (ii) the condition is unclear where the map Γ becomes bijective: e.g., when H̃j corresponds to ground-state ordered structure, Γ is not bijective even for considering low-dimensional configuration space.[\cite=cp] Therefore, in order to practically predict Ũk from H̃k, one should perform trial-and error thermodynamic simulation to find optimal Ũk that provides minimum deviation in predicted structure from observed H̃k. However, the problem still remains: it is unclear whether Ũk can be uniquely determined from H̃k.

In the present study, we propose a theoretical approach enabling to predict PES by directly construct map Γ in a matrix form, from a single measured structure. The significant advantages of the proposed approach are (i) it does not require trial-and-error or multiple simulations to construct Γ, and (ii) we can a priori know whether the map Γ can be numerically bijective within given finite configuration space, by information only about spatial constraint on constituents of the system. We also provide the criteria of whether the measured structure can be used to "uniquely" determine PES, based on the theory of random matrix with gaussian orthogonal ensemble.

Derivation and Discussions

Since the measured macroscopic structure for crystalline solids typically corresponds to specify one microscopic structure s, information of PES that can be extracted from the measured structure can be given by the following expression:

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] denotes inner product, i.e., trace over microscopic states on configuration space with defined metric. In our previous studies,[\cite=lsi] [\cite=emrs] [\cite=yuge-RM] [\cite=gps] we have derived that when configurational DOS (CDOS) for non-interacting system is well-characterized by multidimensional gaussian under constant spatial constraint, canonical average of structure along hr for interacting system with the same class of spatial constraint is universally given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] respectively denotes taking average and standard deviation over microscopic states on configuration space without weight of Boltzmann factor, and [formula] denotes energy of special microscopic state, which we call "projection state" (PS), which can be exactly given by inner product form:

[formula]

where [formula] ([formula]) denotes taking partial average over microscopic states on configuration space, whose structure satisfies [formula] ([formula]). The reason of [formula] given by two ways in Eq. ([\ref=eq:u]) certainly comes from the slight deviation of practical CDOS for non-interacting system under typical spatial constraints (such as fcc, bcc, hcp and diamond lattice) from multidimensional gaussian, resulting in asymmetry of [formula] with respect to [formula]. Note that when CDOS exactly takes multidimensional gaussian, the above two representation results in the same value of [formula], and also Eq. ([\ref=eq:emrs]) becomes exact in classical systems. The asymmetry plays significant role for alloys, naturally resulting in phase separation for multicomponent systems. In our previous study, we only focus on the expression for [formula] to inversely predict PES from measured structure, and no further study is performed, including whether Γ is bijective and whether the measured structure can be applied for prediction of PES, which is quantitatively investigated in the present study including the above asymmetry. From Eqs. ([\ref=eq:u])-([\ref=eq:upm]), we can immediately obtain the following relashionship between PES and measured structure in equilibrium state:

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]. We can easily show that (i) [formula] become exactly identical to [formula] and (ii) matrices of [formula] are real symmetric matrix, when CDOS for non-interacting system is multidimensional gaussian. From the general spectrum theory, any finite real symmetric matrix can be diagonalized. This means that [formula] can always be inversed: i.e., Map from a set of disordered structure in equilibrium state to PES is, within defined dimension of configuration space, bijective. For practical system where CDOS slightly deviates from multidimensional gaussian, one can easily confirm whether the map is bijective, by numerically construct [formula] for a given dimension of configuration space and estimate its determinant. Note that [formula] can be constructed without any information about energy (or interactions), since we can know [formula], [formula] and [formula] without any information about energy or temperature. This means that when spatial constraint on constituents of the system is once given, we can a priori know whether the system possesses bijective map for PES and equilibrium structure. (Which matrix element of [formula] or [formula] could be used to obtain PES is discussed later.)

Up to the present, it is still unclear which measured structure can be applied to Eq. ([\ref=eq:inv]) to obtain reasonable PES. In fact, as described above, there should be multiple PESs to provide ground-state (GS) ordered structure, which means that GS cannot be applied to Eq. ([\ref=eq:inv]). Whether the measured structure is healthy or ill to obtain PES can be quantitaively clarified based on reconsidering which condition Eq. ([\ref=eq:emrs]) holds true: The CDOS for non-interacting system is well-characterized by multidimensional gaussian. This can be more explicitly interpreted, i.e., statistical interdependence between structural degree of freedom numerically vanishes for a large number of constituents in the system, which has been quantitatively investigated in our previous study based on random matrix with gaussian orthogonal ensemble, whose elements are independent normal numbers whose average and standard deviation are respectively normalized to 0 and 1. We have shown that the statistical interdependence can be directly seen by comparing density of eigenvalues for covariance matrix of between practical system and random matrix, where we read M  ×  N random matrix as M-dimensional configuration space with N independently selected microscopic states: The interdependence generally tends to vanish with increase of system size for a wide class of spatial constraint. Therefore, by comparing the size dependence of DOEs for practical system and that for random matrix, we can provide the criteria of whether the given equilibrium structure can be applied to bijective map of Γ: When system size of NR satisfies corresponding DOE numerically coinciding with that for random matrix, the measured structure can be used when it locates well-inside the majority of CDOS along all considered coordination. This is because when the measured structure is outside of the corresponding CDOS, and is inside of the majoritiy of CDOS whose DOE does not coincides with that of random matrix, its structural degree of freedom is not statistically-independent, i.e., bijection of Γ fails. Based on the idea, measured structure [formula] can therefore be healthy when

[formula]

is satisfied, where [formula] ([formula]) denotes CDOS satisfying (not satisfying) vanishment of the statistical interdependence in terms of the system size, and [formula] represents a set of system size where the interdependence is not numerically vanished. Note that there still remains possibility that another map Λ exists, uniquely determine PES to provide such equilibrium structure, while it is clear that the structure cannot apply to our map, Γ.

We finally consider application of the proposed approach to practical systems. First, when equilibrium structure [formula] is measured, we can construct matrix [formula] under given spatial constraint. If [formula] is not numerically symmetric, then we should choose whether [formula] or [formula] is used for individual element, based on

[formula]

This is because measured structure satisfying [formula] mainly contains information about [formula], and vice versa. The possible problems to apply the measured structure can be (i) temperature, β, is not well known due to for instance, low-diffusivity at low temperature, and (ii) spatial region where strucure is thermodynamically equilibrated. For the latter, partial region of whole equilibrium structure is typically measured, while [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=eq:inv]) depends on the system size. Since (i) for large system size, [formula] is approximately a linear function of N to gradually become close to their ideal values at thermodynamic limit, and (ii) differences in temperature just linearly changes the element of [formula], the most simplified modification to Eq. ([\ref=eq:inv]) is to just introduce two additional factors G± individually multiplying by [formula], where two factors of G± should be determined by minimizing difference between measured and predicted structure at given β based on appropriately defined metric.

Conclusions

Based on the information about non-interacting system under given spatial constraint, we can construct map from a set of disordered structure in crystalline solids to that of corresponding PES, which can be almost bijective within finite-dimensional configuration space: The bijective characteristics can be known a priori since the map is given by square matrix form, whose elements are function of temperature and constants determined from class of spatial constraint. We can provide quantitative measure of which measured structure can be applied to the map based on the random matrix theory with gaussian orthogonal ensemble. When temperature and/or spatial region for equilibrated structure is unclear in measurement, we propose simple modification for the constructed map.
