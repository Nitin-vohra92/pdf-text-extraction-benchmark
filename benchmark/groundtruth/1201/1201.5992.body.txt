This paper is based on joint work with András Gács, started in the autumn of 2008, as a continuation of the work in [\cite=DeBeuleGacs]. His unfortunate and sudden death prevented us from continuing our joint work on the geometrical interpretation of the results. I would like to dedicate this work to András.

Introduction

A (finite) generalized quadrangle (GQ) is an incidence structure [formula] in which P and B are disjoint non-empty sets of objects called points and lines, and for which [formula] is a symmetric point-line incidence relation satisfying the following axioms:

each point is incident with 1 + t lines [formula] and two distinct points are incident with at most one line;

each line is incident with 1 + s points [formula] and two distinct lines are incident with at most one point;

if x is a point and L is a line not incident with x, then there is a unique pair (y,M)∈P  ×  B for which [formula].

The integers s and t are the parameters of the GQ and S is said to have order (s,t). If s = t, then S is said to have order s. If S has order (s,t), then |P|  =  (s + 1)(st + 1) and |B|  =  (t + 1)(st + 1) (see e.g. [\cite=PayneThas84]).

An ovoid of a GQ S is a set O of points of S such that every line is incident with exactly one point of the ovoid. An ovoid of a GQ of order (s,t) has necessarily size 1 + st. A partial ovoid of a GQ is a set K of points such that every line contains at most one point of K. A partial ovoid K is called maximal if and only if [formula] is not a partial ovoid for any point [formula], in other words, if K cannot be extended. It is clear that any partial ovoid of a GQ of order (s,t) contains 1 + st - ρ points, ρ  ≥  0, with ρ  =  0 if and only if K is an ovoid.

It is a natural question to study extendability of partial ovoids, i.e. can one alway extend a partial ovoid of size 1 + st - ε (e.g. to an ovoid) if ε is not too big? The following theorem is a typical example.

Let [formula] be a GQ of order (s,t). Any partial ovoid of size st - ρ, [formula] is contained in a uniquely defined ovoid of S.

Note that if no ovoids of a particular GQ exist, then Theorem [\ref=theo1] implies an upper bound on the size of partial ovoids. The following theorem deals with the limit situation, and will be of use in Section [\ref=sec:geom].

Let [formula] be a GQ of order (s,t). Let K be a maximal partial ovoid of size st - t / s of S. Let B' be the set of lines incident with no point of K, and let P' be the set of points on at least one line of B' and let [formula] be the restriction of [formula] to points of P' and lines of B'. Then [formula] is a subquadrangle of order (s,ρ = t / s).

Consider the parabolic quadric (4,q) in the 4-dimensional projective space (4,q). This quadric is the set of points and lines that are totally isotropic with relation to a non-singular quadratic form on (4,q), which is, up to coordinate transform, unique, and its points and lines constitute an example of a generalized quadrangle of order q.

It is known, (see e.g. [\cite=PayneThas84]) that this GQ has ovoids. A particular example of an ovoid is any elliptic quadric -(3,q) contained in it and obtained by a hyperplane section of (4,q). When q is prime, these are the only ovoids [\cite=BallGovaertsStorme]; when q is a prime power, other examples are known, see e.g. [\cite=DeBeuleKleinMetsch11] for a list of references. The classification of ovoids of (4,q), for q prime, is essentially due to the computation of intersection numbers (modulo p) of a hypothetical ovoid with elliptic quadrics, and the use of this information in a combinatorial argument.

Applying Theorem [\ref=theo1] to the GQ (4,q) implies that a partial ovoid of size q2 cannot be maximal. It is shown in [\cite=DeBeuleGacs] that maximal partial ovoids of (4,q), q = ph, p an odd prime, h  >  1, do not exist. The natural question arises if maximal partial ovoids exist when h = 1. Curiously, this is the case when p∈{3,5,7,11}, but no examples are known for q  >  11, [\cite=Penttila]. In this paper we give a slightly alternative proof of the non-existence result for h  >  1. Further, we compute the intersection numbers of a hypothetical maximal partial ovoid of size q2 - 1 with elliptic quadrics embedded in (4,q), for q an odd prime. This yields structural information on the existing examples, and it is our hope that this information could contribute to finally proving their uniqueness and non-existence for p  >  11.

Non-existence for q  >  p

We follow almost the same approach as in [\cite=DeBeuleGacs]. Therefore we need to introduce an alternative representation of the GQ (4,q).

An oval of (2,q) is a set of q + 1 points C, such that no three points of C are collinear. When q is odd, it is known that all ovals of (2,q) are conics. When q is even, several other examples and infinite families are known, see e.g. [\cite=Cheroweb]. The GQ T2(C) is defined as follows. Let C be an oval of (2,q), embed (2,q) as a plane in (3,q) and denote this plane by π∞. Points are defined as follows:

the points of [formula];

the planes π of (3,q) for which [formula];

one new symbol (  ∞  ).

Lines are defined as follows:

the lines of (3,q) which are not contained in (2,q) and meet C (necessarily in a unique point);

the points of C.

Incidence between points of type (i) and (ii) and lines of type (a) and (b) is the inherited incidence of (3,q). In addition, the point (  ∞  ) is incident with no line of type (a) and with all lines of type (b). It is straightforward to show that this incidence structure is a GQ of order q. The following theorem (see e.g. [\cite=PayneThas84]) allows us to use this representation.

The GQs T2(C) and (4,q) are isomorphic if and only if C is a conic of the plane (2,q).

From now on we suppose that C is a conic. Let K be a maximal partial ovoid of size k of T2(C). Since [formula] has a collineation group acting transitively on the points (see e.g. [\cite=HirschfeldThas91]), we can suppose that (  ∞  )∈K. This implies that K contains no points of type (ii). It is clear that no two points of type (i) of K determine a line meeting π∞ in a point of C. Hence the existence of K implies the existence of a set U of k - 1 points of type (i) such that no two points determine a line meeting π∞ in C. It is easy to see that the converse is also true: from a set U of k - 1 points in [formula] with the property that all lines joining at least two points of U are disjoint from C, we can find a partial ovoid K of T2(C) of size k by adding (  ∞  ) to U. The maximality of K is equivalent to the maximality of U.

Hence the existence of a maximal partial ovoid of size q2 - 1 of (4,q), is equivalent with the existence of a set U of q2 - 2 affine points, not determining the points of a conic at infinity. In [\cite=DeBeuleGacs], it is shown that such a set U can always be extended when q  >  p. In fact, only the assumption that at least p + 2 points are not determined is used. In this paper we will assume that the points of a conic are not determined and that U is not extendable, compute the range of a certain polynomial, and find a contradiction when q  >  p. In the third section, we will describe the use of this particular polynomial to compute the intersection numbers modulo p of the point set U with planes of (3,q). This will yield intersection numbers modulo p of the maximal partial ovoid of size q2 - 1 with elliptic quadrics embedded in (4,q).

From now on, let K denote a partial ovoid of (4,q), q = ph, p an odd prime and h  ≥  1. Let U denote the point set of [formula] corresponding with the partial ovoid of (4,q).

If a plane π  ≠  π∞ of (3,q), meets C in at least one point, then [formula].

Let [formula]. If [formula], then at least one of the q lines of π through P must contain two points of U. This contradicts the fact that U does not determine any point of C. Hence, [formula].

We choose π∞ to be the plane with equation X3  =  0. Then any line l of π∞ is determined by the equation yX0  +  zX1  +  wX2  =  0, [formula]. We denote such a line as l(y,z,w). Any plane π  ≠  π∞ through l(y,z,w) is determined by the equation yX0  +  zX1  +  wX2 + xX3  =  0. We denote such a plane as π(x,y,z,w).

The point set [formula]. We define the Rédei polynomial associated to the point set U as follows:

[formula]

Here σi(Y,Z,W) is the i-th elementary symmetric polynomial of the multi-set {aiY + biZ + ciZ:i} and is either zero or has degree i.

Suppose that the line l(y,z,w) meets C in at least one point. Then R(X,y,z,w)|(Xq - X)q.

If [formula] is a root of R(X,y,z,w)  =  0, then its multiplicity equals [formula] (the latter by Lemma [\ref=le:pigeon]). Since |U|  =  q2 - 2, each of the q planes π(x,y,z,w), [formula], contains points of U, hence R(X,y,z,w) = 0 has each element [formula] as root, with multiplicity at most q, and the lemma follows.

Since we suppose that q is odd and |U| = q2 - 2, after the affine translation

[formula]

not affecting the (non)-determined points at infinity, we may assume that [formula], which is equivalent to [formula].

If a line l(y,z,w) has at least one common point with C, then

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=le:div] we know that

[formula]

where S and S' are not necessarily different and depend on y,z,w. Considering the first three terms on both sides and taking into account that [formula], we have (X - S)(X - S') = X2  -  σ2(y,z,w).

Suppose that the line l(y,z,w) meets C in at least one point. Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Computation of both right-hand and left-hand sides of Equation [\eqref=eq:sigma2], and the use of [formula] proves the lemma.

[formula]

[formula]

Consider any line l(y,z,w) meeting C in at least one point. By Lemma [\ref=le:sigmas], the equations of the corollary are true after subsituting Y = y, Z = z, W = w. But for each point P∈C, each line l(y,z,w) on P gives a substitution for which the equations are true. Dually, this means that the points of at least q + 1 different lines are a solution of the equations of the corollary. Since the degree of each equation is at most q, by the theorem of Bézout, each curve represented by an equation must contain q + 1 lines as a component. But then its degree must be at least q + 1. Hence, the polynomials are identically zero.

We define now the polynomials Sj, [formula] as follows.

[formula]

The Newton identities describe a relation between the polynomials Sj(Y,Z,W) and σi(Y,Z,W) as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using Corollary [\ref=cor:sigmas], the Newton identities, the fact that [formula], σ0  =  1, and induction, the lemma follows.

If σ2(Y,Z,W) is reducible then the set U is extendable.

Suppose that σ2(Y,Z,W) is reducible. By equation [\eqref=eq:sigma2], σ2(y,z,w) must be a square for any (y,z,w) such that l(y,z,w) meets C in at least one point. So there are triples (y,z,w), contained in a line (the dual of the pencil of lines through a point P∈C) for which σ2(y,z,w) is a square. It follows that σ2(Y,Z,W)  =  (AY + BZ + CW)2. Now define [formula]. Consider any point P∈C and any line l(y,z,w) on P. From Equation [\eqref=eq:sigma2] it follows that each plane on l now contains exactly q points of U*. But if P is a point determined by U*, then there exists a line m on P containing r  ≥  2 points of U*. But all q + 1 planes on m contain exactly q points of U*, so q2  =  |U*| = r + (q + 1)(q - r), a contradiction. Hence, U* does not determine the points of C.

If U is not extendable, then q = p.

We define

[formula]

where we used Lemma [\ref=le:sj] to obtain the second last equality. If U is not extendable, then σ2(Y,Z,W) is not reducible. So the range of σ2(Y,Z,W) is the complete field [formula], so for each non-square [formula], we can find a triple (y,z,w) such that σ2(y,z,w) = ν. Then [formula] and

[formula]

It is now easy to see that the range of χ(X,Y,Z,W) will contain at least [formula] different elements of [formula]. On the other hand,

[formula]

for any 4-tuple [formula]. So the right hand side is necessarily an element of [formula], a contradiction with the range of χ(X,Y,Z,W) if q  >  p.

The intersection numbers for q a prime

Suppose now that q = p, p an odd prime. We consider the possibilities of χ(X,Y,Z,W). Consider a plane π(x,y,z,w).

Suppose that σ2(y,z,w)  =  0. Then χ(X,y,z,w)  =   - 2Xq - 1, hence χ(x,y,z,w) = 0 if x = 0 and χ(x,y,z,w) =  - 2 if x  ≠  0.

Suppose that σ2(y,z,w) is a square different from 0. If x2  ≠  σ2(y,z,w) then χ(x,y,z,w)  =   - 2. If x2  =  σ2(y,z,w) then χ(x,y,z,w)  =   - 1.

Suppose that σ2(y,z,w) is a non-square. Then

[formula]

The curve σ2(Y,Z,W)  =  0 is the dual of C.

Theorem [\ref=theo2] ensures that the set of lines of (4,q), not meeting K, is the set of lines of a hyperbolic quadric embedded as a hyperplane section in (4,q). We denote this hyperbolic quadric as +. Since [formula], clearly [formula], and from the proof of Theorem [\ref=theo3] in [\cite=PayneThas84], it follows that + is represented in T2(C) as a hyperbolic quadric meeting π∞ in C. We denote this quadric as +T. The hyperbolic quadric +T contains exactly q + 1 points of type (ii). Consider such a point, represented by the plane π. The two lines of type (a) of +T incident with π, are contained in π, and do not meet U. But the other q - 1 lines of T2(C), incident with π, do meet U in exactly one point. Hence the plane π must contain exactly q - 2 points of U. If π is represented by the 4-tuple (x,y,z,w), then [formula]. So if [formula], then χ(x,y,z,w) = 0 and by the above overview of the range of χ, the planes π(x,y,z,w) that represent a point of type (ii) of +T, are exactly those for which σ2(y,z,w)  =  0  =  x. But the planes that represent points of type (ii) of +T are planes that meet C in a tangent line. Hence, σ2(y,z,w) = 0 if and only if l(y,z,w) is a tangent line to C.

A plane π(x,y,z,w) represents an elliptic quadric containing (  ∞  ) if and only if σ2(y,z,w) is a non-square.

From the proof of Theorem [\ref=theo3], it follows that an elliptic quadric containing (  ∞  ) is represented in T2(C) by a plane meeting π∞ in a line external to C. The Corollary now follows from Lemma [\ref=le:dual].

If an elliptic quadric -  ⊂  (4,q) contains a point of K, then

[formula]

If an elliptic quadric contains a point of K, we can choose it to be the point (  ∞  ). Then

[formula]

ν  =  σ2(y,z,w), which is non-square.

Consider now any point [formula]. Then [formula] is a conic CP, and [formula], [formula]. We call P' the antipode of P. Consider now the point (  ∞  ), this is collinear with the points of type (ii) of +T. But for each point of type (ii) of +T, represented by a plane π(x,y,z,w), we have seen that x = 0. Hence the point (0,0,0,1) is contained in the planes representing the points of type (ii) of +T, so, the points of type (ii) of +T are collinear with (0,0,0,1). Hence, the point (0,0,0,1) is the antipode of the point (  ∞  ).

If an elliptic quadric -  ⊂  (4,q) contains a point of K and its antipode, then [formula].

A point and its antipode are non-collinear, and the collineation group of (4,q) acts transitively on the pairs of non-collinear points. So in the T2(C) representation, if an elliptic quadric contains a point of K, this can be chosen (  ∞  ) while its antipode can be chosen to be the point (0,0,0,1). For a plane π(x,y,z,w) containing (0,0,0,1), we have x = 0. The lemma now follows from Corollary [\ref=cor:el].

We remark that the computed intersection numbers (modulo q) do not exclude elliptic quadrics that contain no point of K. We list the range for intersection numbers modulo q found in Corollary [\ref=cor:el] for q∈{5,7,11}. Recall that these numbers are valid for elliptic quadrics containing at least one point of K. Hence 0 means a positive multiple of q in reality.

q = 5: {0,2,3}

q = 7: {2,3,4,6}

q = 11: {0,4,5,8,9,10}.

We used an explicit description of the known examples ([\cite=kc]) to compute the intersection numbers with all elliptic quadrics. We list the results. In this list, for q = 5 and q = 11, we see that there are elliptic quadrics containing no point of K. However this 0 is not related to a 0 in the above list.

q = 5: {0,2,3,5,8,12}

q = 7: {2,3,4,6,9,10,18}

q = 11: {0,4,5,8,9,10,11,15,16,20,30}.

As a final remark, we notice that the number of different intersection numbers is relatively large compared with q. On the other hand, an elliptic quadric containing a point of K and its antipode always meets K in - 3q points. In the above list, we notice for each q only two different intersection numbers corresponding to - 3q. This might suggest that pairs point-antipode play a special role, and indeed, for the known examples, it is true that when a point belongs to K, then also its antipode belongs to K, [\cite=kc]. Unfortunately, the above combinatorial information seems too weak to prove such a characterisation. It is our feeling that such a characterisation could be helpful in proving the non-existence for larger q. We note that in [\cite=kc], where a completely different approach is used, a comparable conclusion on the pairs point-antipode is made. Finally, we also mention the work in [\cite=DWT], where the non-existence for larger q is shown under the extra assumption that (q2 - 1)2 divides the order of the automorphism group of the maximal partial ovoid.
