On the stability of standing waves of Klein-Gordon equations in a semiclassical regime

Introduction and results

The nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation

[formula]

where ε,m > 0, p > 1 for N = 1,2 and 1 < p < (N + 2) / (N - 2) for N  ≥  3, is one of the simplest nonlinear partial differential equations invariant for the Poincaré group. We are interested in the study of the nonlinear Klein Gordon equation in presence of a potential depending on the space variable. Two different choices are viable. We can simply add a potential term W(x)u to equation [\eqref=kg]. This case has been studied, for the linear wave equation, for example, by Beals and Strauss in [\cite=BS]. Otherwise, if we want to fully preserve the invariance for the Poincaré group of [\eqref=kg], we have to change the temporal derivative ε2∂tt with a covariant derivative, depending on the potential D2tt, where Dt  =  ε∂t  +  iV(x). This second approach is classical, in quantum electrodynamics, when considering electromagnetic waves. The first approach leads us to consider the equation

[formula]

while the second one to investigate the equation

[formula]

In this paper, we treat simultaneously the two previous Klein-Gordon equations by studying

[formula]

where [formula], ε > 0 and V,W are real valued potential functions. Equation [\eqref=genequation] formally yields to [\eqref=primod] for the choice W = V2 as well as to [\eqref=seconmod] when V = 0. We shall study the stability of standing waves of this equation in the semiclassical regime ε  →  0. It admits standing waves, namely solutions of the form u(x,t) = eiωt / εφω(x / ε), where [formula] and φω satisfies

[formula]

To ensure existence of solutions to [\eqref=ellip-omega] for ε close to 0, we assume the following. Let V and W be C2. For the function

[formula]

there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Furthermore, we assume that

[formula]

Under these hypotheses, it is well-know (see e.g. [\cite=AmBaCi97] or [\cite=AmMa06]) that when ε is close to 0 the equation [\eqref=ellip-omega] admits a family of positive, exponentially decaying, solutions [formula] (hiding the dependance upon ε). More precisely, there exists [formula] and [formula] such that [formula] in [formula] as ε  →  0, where [formula] and

We are interested in the (orbital) stability or instability of standing waves when ε goes to 0.

A standing wave of [\eqref=genequation] is said to be (orbitally) stable if any solution of [\eqref=genequation] starting close to the standing wave remains close for all time, up to the invariances of the equation. More precisely, we say that [formula] is stable if for all η > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all [formula] verifying [formula] the solution u(x,t) of [\eqref=genequation] with initial data u0 satisfies

[formula]

Since the pioneering works [\cite=BeCa81] [\cite=CaLi82] [\cite=GrShSt87] [\cite=GrShSt90] [\cite=We83] [\cite=We85], the study of orbital stability for standing waves of dispersive PDE has attracted a lot of attention. Among many others, one can refer to [\cite=JeLe06] [\cite=JeLe09] [\cite=LeFuFiKsSi08]; see also the books and surveys [\cite=Ca03] [\cite=Le09] [\cite=St08] [\cite=Ta09] and the references therein. Relatively few works [\cite=IaLe09] [\cite=LiWe08] [\cite=Oh89] are concerned with stability at the semi-classical limit for Schrödinger type equations. For Klein-Gordon equations, after the ground works [\cite=ShSt85] [\cite=Sh85], there has been a recent interest for stability by blow-up [\cite=OhTo05] [\cite=OhTo06] [\cite=OhTo07] [\cite=LiOhTo07].

To study stability, we first rewrite [\eqref=genequation] in Hamiltonian form

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

It is easy to see that if u solves [\eqref=genequation] and v is defined by v: = εut + iVu, then [formula] solves [\eqref=eq:hamilt]. The charge Q(U) is defined by

[formula]

In particular, for a standing wave u = eiωt / εφω(x / ε), the charge is given by

[formula]

According to the theory developed in [\cite=GrShSt87] [\cite=GrShSt90], a standing wave [formula] is stable if two conditions are satisfied.

The Slope Condition: [formula].

The Spectral Condition: [formula] has exactly one negative eigenvalue and is non degenerate.

On the other hand, denote by [formula] the number of negative eigenvalues of [formula] and set p(ω)  =  0 if [formula], p(ω)  =  1 if [formula]. Then the standing wave is unstable if [formula] is odd.

Then we have the following

Assume that conditions [\eqref=criticality]-[\eqref=positivity] hold. Then, we have the following facts.

If p < 1 + 4 / N, then the Slope Condition [formula] is fulfilled if

[formula]

or if

[formula]

If p  ≥  1 + 4 / N, then we always have [formula].

We have the equality [formula], where [formula] is the number of negative eigenvalues of [formula].

In particular, the standing waves eiωtφω are stable if x0 is non-degenerate local minimum of Z, p < 1 + 4 / N and

[formula]

Note that, conversely to what was happening in the case of Schrödinger equations studied in [\cite=LiWe08], the values of the potentials V and W at x0 comes into play for the Slope Condition even in the noncritical case. Note also that only the local behavior of Z around x0 influences the stability or instability.

Notations : Most of the objects we consider will depend both on ε and ω. We will emphasize the most important parameter by indicating it as a subscript, the dependence in the other parameter being understood.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. We start be focusing on the Slope Condition and then we study the Spectral Condition. For the sake of simplicity in notations and without loss of generality, in the rest of this section we assume that x0 = 0.

The Slope Condition

We start with the noncritical case.

Noncritical case

We assume that

[formula]

We first rewrite Q(φω) by expanding V(εy) and using the exponential decay of φω:

[formula]

Therefore, since

[formula]

to evaluate the sign of the map [formula] one should compute the quantity

[formula]

where [formula].

We remark that differentiation of [\eqref=ellip-omega] with respect to ω easily yields

[formula]

If we now introduce the rescaling [formula], it follows that φλ satisfies

[formula]

Now, differentiating equation [\eqref=ellip-lambda] with respect to λ and denoting [formula] yields

[formula]

Since 0 is a critical point of Z, a Taylor expansion gives Then, from [\eqref=oplin], as ε  →  0 we have

[formula]

Then, in turn, taking into account identity [\eqref=identitt] we get

[formula]

In conclusion, by combining [\eqref=Q1], [\eqref=Q2] and [\eqref=oplin-appr], we have

[formula]

Then, taking into account the fact that Z(0) > 0 and that φω converges to ψω in [formula] as ε  →  0, the sign of [formula] is the sign of

[formula]

Critical case

We assume now that

[formula]

In the critical case, the term of order εN in the expansion of [formula] vanishes and we need to calculate the expansion at a higher order. We first refine [\eqref=sviluppo1]-[\eqref=sviluppo2]. Then [\eqref=oplin] gives

[formula]

Now, we have

[formula]

From [\eqref=identitt], we obtain

[formula]

Expanding the potential V we get

[formula]

Note that since [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

where the last cancellation comes from the fact that ψω is radial. Coming back to [\eqref=eq:comeback] and as in [\eqref=eq:nondegcase], we have

[formula]

It remains to compute the integrals involving the Hessians in [\eqref=eq:hessian1] and [\eqref=eq:hessian2]. Since our problem is invariant by an orthonormal transformation, we can assume without loss of generality that [formula]. Hence [formula]. Recall also that Tλ can be computed explicitly to have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

We have after integration by parts

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Recall the following expansion in ε for Rω and φω.

[formula]

Therefore, since ψω is radial,

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

Summarizing, using successively [\eqref=eq:hessian1], [\eqref=eq:hessian2], [\eqref=eq:star], [\eqref=eq:starstar] and [\eqref=eq:degencase] we have obtained

[formula]

Now, we compute [formula]. First, recall that, coming back to the definition [\eqref=eq:defQ] of Q, we have

[formula]

As in [\eqref=eq:Vexpansion], [\eqref=eq:cancelation], and [\eqref=eq:star] we can expand in ε and get

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Using [\eqref=eq:summarize], we finally get

[formula]

The Spectral Condition

We define the operator L0: =  - Δ + Z(0) - pψp - 1ω. It is well known (see e.g. [\cite=AmMa06]) that the spectrum of L0 consists of one negative eigenvalue, a N-dimensional kernel (generated by [formula] for [formula]) and the rest of the spectrum is bounded away from 0. When ε is close to 0, the spectrum of [formula] will be close to the spectrum of L0. In particular, the 0 eigenvalue, of multiplicity N, will transform into N possibly different eigenvalues close to 0 but shifted either to the positive or to the negative side of the real axis, depending on the sign of the eigenvalues of the Hessian of Z at 0. More precisely, the following proposition was proved in [\cite=LiWe08] (see [\cite=IaLe09] for a detailed justification).

The spectrum of [formula] consists of positive spectrum away from 0 and a set of N + 1 simple eigenvalues [formula] such that

[formula]

As [formula], we have λ0 < 0 and the following asymptotic expansion holds for the other eigenvalues:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix [formula].

Therefore, (3) in Theorem [\ref=mainthm] is a direct consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:spectrum]. In particular, the spectral condition for stability will be satisfied if and only if 0 is a non-degenerate local minimum of Z.
