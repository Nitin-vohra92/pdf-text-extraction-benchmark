Extensions of Copson's Inequalities

Introduction

Let p > 0 and [formula] be a non-negative sequence. Let (λn)n  ≥  1 be a non-negative sequence with λ1 > 0 and let [formula]. The classical Copson's inequalities are referred as the following ones [\cite=C]:

[formula]

When λk = 1 for all k and c = p, inequality [\eqref=1.1] becomes the celebrated Hardy's inequality ([\cite=HLP]). We note that the reversed inequality of [\eqref=1.2] holds when c  ≤  0 < p < 1 and the constants are best possible in all these cases.

It is easy to show that inequalities [\eqref=1.1] and [\eqref=1.2] are equivalent to each other by the duality principle [\cite=M] for the norms of linear operators. It's observed by Bennett [\cite=B1] that inequality [\eqref=1.1] continues to hold for c > p with constant (p / (p - 1))p. A natural question to ask now is whether inequality [\eqref=1.1] itself continues to hold for c > p. Note that in this case the constant (p / (c - 1))p is best possible by considering the case λn = 1, xn = n(c - p - 1 - ε) / p with ε  →  0+.

As analogues to Copson's inequalities, the following inequalities are due to Leindler [\cite=L]:

[formula]

where we assume [formula] and we set [formula]. We point out here that Leindler's result corresponds to case c = 0 of inequality [\eqref=1.3], after a change of variables. Inequalities [\eqref=1.3] and [\eqref=1.4] are given in [\cite=B1]. Again it is easy to see that inequalities [\eqref=1.3] and [\eqref=1.4] are equivalent to each other by the duality principle. Moreover, the constants are best possible.

As an application of Copson's inequalities, we note the following result of Bennett and Grosse-Erdmann [\cite=BGE1] that asserts for p  ≥  1,α  ≥  1,

[formula]

Here the constant is best possible. They also conjectured [\cite=BGE1] that inequality [\eqref=1.5] (resp. its reverse) remains valid with the same best possible constant when p  ≥  1,0  <  a  <  1 (resp.  - 1 / p  <  a  <  0). Weaker constants are given for these cases in [\cite=BGE1].

It is our goal in this paper to show in the next section that the method developed in [\cite=G6]-[\cite=G9] can be applied to extend Copson's inequality [\eqref=1.1] to some c > p (or equivalently, by the duality principle, to extend Copson's inequality [\eqref=1.2] to some c < 0). In Section [\ref=sec_3], we extend inequality [\eqref=1.5] to some 0 < α < 1.

Main Result

Before we prove our main result, we need a lemma first.

Let p > 0 be fixed. In order for the following inequality (resp. its reverse)

[formula]

to be valid when c < 0,p > 1 (resp. when 0 < c < 1,0 < p < 1) for all 0  ≤  x  ≤  1, it suffices that it is valid when x = 1.

As the proofs for both cases are similar, we only consider the case c < 0,p > 1 here. Let

[formula]

Note that fp,c(0) = 0 and we have

[formula]

It is easy to see that f''p,c(x) = 0 is equivalent to the equation gp,c(x) = 0 where

[formula]

If 0 > c >  - 1, then it is easy to see that f'''p,c(x) < 0 so that f''p,c(x) = 0 has at most one root in (0,1). As lim x  →  1-f''p,c(x) =  -   ∞  , it follows that if f''p,c(x)  ≤  0 for all 0  ≤  x < 1, then fp,c(x) is concave down and the assertion of the lemma follows. Otherwise we have f''p,c(0) > 0 and this combined with the observation that f'p,c(0) = 0,f'p,c(1) < 0 implies that there exists an x0∈[0,1] such that f'p,c(x)  ≥  0 for 0  ≤  x  ≤  x0 and f'p,c(x)  ≤  0 for x0  ≤  x  ≤  1 and the assertion of the lemma follows. The case c =  - 1 can be similarly discussed.

If c <  - 1, then g'p,c(x) = 0 has at most one root in (0,1) so that f''p,c(x) = 0 has at most two roots in (0,1). If f''p,c(0) < 0, then as f''p,c(1) > 0, it follows that f''p,c(x) = 0 has exactly one root in (0,1), and as f'p,c(0) = 0,f'p,c(1) < 0, it follows that f'p,c(x)  <  0 for all x∈[0,1] and the assertion of the lemma follows. If f''p,c(0) > 0, then f''p,c(x) = 0 has either no root or two roots in (0,1). If f''p,c(x) = 0 has no root in (0,1), then f''p,c(x)  ≥  0 for x∈[0,1]. As f'p,c(0) = 0,f'p,c(1)  <  0, we see that this is not possible. If f''p,c(x) = 0 has two roots in (0,1), it follows that fp,c(x) is first increasing, then decreasing and then increasing again for x∈[0,1] and it follows from f'p,c(1)  <  0 that there exists an x'0∈[0,1] such that f'p,c(x)  ≥  0 for 0  ≤  x  ≤  x'0 and f'p,c(x)  ≤  0 for x'0  ≤  x  ≤  1 and the assertion of the lemma again follows. The case f''p,c(0) = 0 can be discussed similarly as above and this completes the proof.

We now consider extending inequality [\eqref=1.2] to c < 0. For two fixed two positive sequences {an},{bn}, we recall that it is shown in [\cite=G8] that we have the following inequality:

[formula]

where {wn} is a positive sequence, N is a large integer and for 1  ≤  n  ≤  N, we set [formula] and An = Sn / an.

We now recast inequality [\eqref=1.2] as

[formula]

It remains to establish inequality [\eqref=2.02]. For this, it suffices to establish inequality [\eqref=2.02] with the infinite sums replaced by finite sums from 1 to N. We may also assume λn > 0 for all n. We then set

[formula]

in inequality [\eqref=2.01] to see that in order to establish inequality [\eqref=2.02], it suffices to find a positive sequence {wn} such that

[formula]

Upon a change of variables: wn  →  λnwn, we can recast the above inequalities as

[formula]

We now define the sequence {wn} inductively by setting w1 = 1 and for n  ≥  2,

[formula]

This implies that for n  ≥  2,

[formula]

Using the above relations, we can simplify inequalities [\eqref=2.03], [\eqref=2.04] to see that inequality [\eqref=2.03] is equivalent to inequality [\eqref=2.7] with x = λn  /  Λn while inequality [\eqref=2.04] is equivalent to

[formula]

It is easy to see that the above inequality is just the case x = 1 of inequality [\eqref=2.7], we then conclude from Lemma [\ref=lem1] that inequality [\eqref=1.2] is valid for c < 0 as long as the above inequality holds.

Next, we consider extending inequality [\eqref=1.3] to c < 0. For two fixed two positive sequences {an},{bn}, we recall that it is shown in [\cite=G7] (see also the discussion in Section 5 of [\cite=G9]) that in order for the following inequality

[formula]

to be valid for a given constant Up,p > 1, it suffices to find a positive sequence {wn} such that

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we may assume λn > 0 for all n. By a change of variables, we recast inequality [\eqref=1.3] as

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=2.1] that in order to establish the above inequality, it suffices to find a positive sequence {wn} such that

[formula]

By a change of variables: wn  ↦  λnwn, we can recast the above inequality as

[formula]

We now define the sequence {wn} inductively by setting w1 = 1 and for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

This implies that for n  ≥  2,

[formula]

Using the above relations, we can simplify inequality [\eqref=2.2] to see that the n  ≥  2 cases are equivalent to inequality [\eqref=2.7] with x = λn  /  Λ*n. It is also easy to see that the n = 1 case of [\eqref=2.2] corresponds to the following inequality:

[formula]

It is easy to see that the above inequality is implied by inequality [\eqref=2.7], we then conclude from Lemma [\ref=lem1] that inequality [\eqref=1.3] holds for c < 0 as long as inequality [\eqref=2.6] holds.

Note that for fixed p > 0, the function (1 + x)1 - p - x is a decreasing function of x. Moreover, it is easy to see that inequality [\eqref=2.6] (resp. its reverse) always holds with c = 0 when p > 1 (resp. when 0 < p < 1). We note that our discussions above for inequality [\eqref=1.2] can be carried out for the case 0 < p < 1,0 < c < 1 with the related inequalities reversed. We therefore obtain the following

Let p > 0 be fixed. Let c0 denote the unique number satisfying

[formula]

Then inequalities [\eqref=1.2] and [\eqref=1.3] hold for all c0  ≤  c < 1 when p > 1 and the reversed inequality [\eqref=1.2] holds for all c < c0 when 0 < p < 1.

We leave it to the reader for the corresponding extensions to c > p of inequalities [\eqref=1.1] and [\eqref=1.4] by the duality principle.

Some related results

In this section we first consider the conjecture of Bennett and Grosse-Erdmann on inequality [\eqref=1.5] for the case 0 < α < 1. We may assume λn > 0 for all n. We note here that it is shown in [\cite=BGE1] that it suffices to show that

[formula]

where we set Λ0 = 0. By the duality principle, it is easy to see that the above inequality is equivalent to

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=2.1] that in order to establish the above inequality, it suffices to find a positive sequence {wn} such that

[formula]

By a change of variables: wn  ↦  λnwn, we can recast the above inequality as

[formula]

We now define the sequence {wn} inductively by setting w1 = 1 and for n  ≥  1,
