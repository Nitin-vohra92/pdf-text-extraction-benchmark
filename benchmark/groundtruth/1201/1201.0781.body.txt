Hypercomplex limits of pluricomplex structures and the Euclidean limit of hyperbolic monopoles

Introduction

BPS monopoles have especially nice moduli spaces on the Euclidean and the hyperbolic 3-spaces. In particular, moduli spaces of framed Euclidean monopoles are complete hyperkähler manifolds (at least for the gauge group SU(2), or SU(N) and maximal symmetry breaking at infinity). On the other hand, the geometry of hyperbolic monopoles has been identified in [\cite=BS] (building on an earlier work by Nash [\cite=Nash]), as pluricomplex geometry, i.e. given by a 2-sphere of complex structures without any anticommuting properties. In the present work, we aim to show how the pluricomplex geometry of hyperbolic monopoles converges to the hyperkähler geometry of Euclidean monopoles, as the curvature of the hyperbolic space tends to zero. An unexpected result of our analysis is that the geometry of Euclidean monopoles is richer than hyperkähler geometry: in addition to a 2-sphere of complex structures, there is, for each of these complex structures J, a preferred endomorphism AJ of the tangent bundle, which anticommutes with J (and usually is not a complex structure). These endomorphisms AJ satisfy integrability conditions, and their existence can be viewed as a purely differential-geometric explanation of why the hypercomplex geometry of Euclidean monopoles is determined by algebraic curves of higher genus.

The existence of such endomorphisms AJ is a more general phenomenon: they arise for any hypercomplex structure which is a limit of pluricomplex structures. We call such structures l-hypercomplex ("l" for limit), and discuss them in Section [\ref=LHC]. We think that they will repay further investigation, particularly those which we call strongly integrable, i.e. those, for which the endomorphisms AJ satisfy integrability conditions (just as for moduli spaces of Euclidean monopoles).

We finish this introduction with some bibliographical comments. The Euclidean limit of hyperbolic monopoles has been discussed in detail by Jarvis and Norbury [\cite=JN], albeit with a different framing (in the interior rather than on the boundary). With our choice of framing (which is the one that leads to hyperkähler or pluricomplex geometry), the twistorial description of the Euclidean limit has been given by Atiyah [\cite=A]. Finally, the limiting behaviour of spectral curves for charge 2 monopoles has been described by Norbury and Romão [\cite=NR].

Convergence of minitwistor spaces

Hitchin [\cite=Hit1] has shown that the space of oriented geodesics in a 3-manifold of constant curvature has a natural structure of a complex manifold. For [formula], this complex manifold is [formula], while for the hyperbolic space H3 it is [formula], where the two copies of [formula] correspond to the startpoint and the endpoint of a geodesic on the ideal boundary [formula] of H3.

We find it convenient, as do many other authors, to change the complex structure on the second factor to the opposite one, using the antipodal map. Thus, we identify the space of geodesics in H3 with [formula], where [formula] is the antidiagonal.

There is a subtlety here: the identification of [formula] with [formula] implies a choice of a preferred point in H3. Indeed, we could use, instead of the antipodal map, an arbitrary antiholomorphic Möbius transformation [formula]. The geodesics beginning at [formula] and ending at f(ζ) have a unique common point xf. Observe that, under the identification of points in H3 with real curves in [formula] ([formula]), the point xf always corresponds to the diagonal in [formula].

In the case when f is the antipodal map, we denote xf by x0. We now rescale the hyperbolic space with x0 as preferred point. In other words, we consider the family (H3κ,x0) of pointed hyperbolic spaces, with the scalar curvature of H3κ equal to -  κ. Its limit, as κ  →  0, is the Euclidean 3-space [formula]. We want to describe the limiting behaviour of the spaces of geodesics as complex manifolds. Observe, that if γn is a sequence of geodesics in H3κn, corresponding to [formula], and converging to a Euclidean geodesic γ∞, then (ζn,γn) convergences to a point (ζ∞,ζ∞) on the diagonal, since the two asymptotic directions of a Euclidean geodesic are opposite to each other. It is not hard to see that the limiting Euclidean geodesic γ∞ is the one we expect: γ∞ corresponds to the point v∞∈Tζ∞Δ, where v∞ is the limit of the direction between ζn and ηn (this has been already observed by Norbury and Romão [\cite=NR]). In other words, if we choose coordinates (ζ,w) on [formula] so that ζ is the affine coordinate on [formula] and [formula] are the corresponding vector fields, then the geodesic γ∞ has coordinates (ζ∞,w∞), where [formula]. The reason for the square root is that the rescaling by t changes the scalar curvature by t2.

The convergence of minitwistor spaces has been also described (in slightly different terms) in Atiyah's paper [\cite=A].

A holomorphic description

We now give a description of the above in terms of deformation theory. We shall construct a complex 3-manifold X fibreing over [formula], so that the fibre over 0 is [formula], all other fibres are isomorphic to [formula]. More precisely, we require X and the holomorphic projection [formula] to have the following properties:

π is a holomorphic submersion.

π- 1(0) is isomorphic to [formula].

There exists a biholomorphism [formula], the restriction φt of which to each fibre π- 1(t) maps this fibre to [formula].

If xn is a convergent sequence of points in X, such that tn  =  π(xn)  →  0, then φtn(xn) converges to a point on the diagonal [formula].

There is a real structure on X, compatible with the above.

The last property means that the real structure σ on X induces the standard real structure on [formula], π intertwines σ and the complex conjugation on [formula], and φ intertwines σ and the standard real structure on [formula] given by

[formula]

We construct X by glueing two charts

[formula]

[formula]

over ζ,  ≠  0, ζ + tw,  +  t̃w̃  ≠  0 via the transition map:

[formula]

We have a holomorphic projection [formula], π(ζ,w,t) = t and we write Xt for π- 1(t). The fibre X0 is [formula]. For t  ≠  0 we can change the coordinates (ζ,w) and (,w̃) to (ζ,η) and (,), where

[formula]

It follows then that   =  η- 1 and, consequently Xt is biholomorphic to [formula] for t  ≠  0. The map [\eqref=eta] describes the biholomorphism φ:

[formula]

Finally, the real structure on X is defined by

[formula]

In coordinates (ζ,η,t), t  ≠  0, σ is given by σ(ζ,η,t) = ( - 1 / , - 1 / ,), and so it coincides with σ0, given by [\eqref=si0].

We can compactify the t-variable by adding [formula] corresponding to t =   ∞  . We denote the resulting complex manifold by [formula]. The fibration π extend to [formula], and the real structure σ extends to [formula].

The manifold X can be realised as an open subset of [formula] with the induced real structure and it occurs in that guise in the paper of Atiyah [\cite=A]. Our description, given above, is more suitable to pluricomplex geometry.

Convergence

We wish to make explicit the relation between curves in X and points in hyperbolic spaces of varying curvature. We identify H3κ (the hyperbolic space of scalar curvature -  κ) with the half space [formula], equipped with the metric

[formula]

Clearly H3κ convergences to the Euclidean [formula] on subsets on which z remains bounded.

A point (x,y,z)∈Hκ corresponds to the curve in [formula], given by the equation

[formula]

(see [\cite=MS] or [\cite=NR] for the case κ = 1). Multiplying [\eqref=curve] by r and regrouping yields

[formula]

We view this curve as embedded in X1 / r. If we change coordinates back to ζ,w, where η  =  ζ + tw = ζ + w / r, and let r  →    ∞  , we obtain the limit curve (x + iy) + 2zζ - (x - iy)ζ2 - w = 0, which corresponds to [formula].

Thus, σ-invariant (1,1)-curves in Xt correspond to points of H3t2, with the correspondence given by [\eqref=curve] or [\eqref=curve2], with r = t- 1. Moreover:

Let Cn  ⊂  Xtn be a sequence of σ-invariant (1,1)-curves, given by the equation [formula]. Suppose that tn  →  0, and that a00n,a11n,a10n - 1 / tn have finite limits A00,A11,A10. Then the points (xn,yn,zn)∈H31 / t2n corresponding to Cn converge to the point [formula] corresponding to the limit curve w = A00 + A10ζ + A11ζ2 in X0. [formula]

Convergence of monopoles

We recall [\cite=A] [\cite=Hit1] [\cite=MS] that Euclidean or hyperbolic monopoles correspond to algebraic curves in corresponding minitwistor spaces, i.e. in [formula] or in [formula]. These curves satisfy certain conditions, the most important of which is the triviality of certain line bundle. In the case of hyperbolic monopoles of charge k and mass m, this is the line bundle O(2m + k, - 2m - k)≃O(1, - 1)2m + k on [formula] (the line bundle O(1, - 1) is topologically trivial on [formula] and can be raised to an arbitrary complex power). In the case of Euclidean monopoles of charge k, this is the line bundle L2, with transition function exp ( - 2w / ζ) in the standard coordinates ζ, [formula].

We now combine these line bundles to define certain line bundles on [formula] (a partial compactification of X, described in Remark [\ref=cpct]):

For every [formula], the line bundle O(a,b) has transition function ζaηb if t  ≠  0 and ζa + b if t = 0.

The line bundle L has transition function [formula] if t  ≠  0, and exp ( - w / ζ) if t = 0.

This last formula requires explanation, as [formula] is not well defined unless 1 / t is an integer. What the formula means is that L|Xt  =  O(1 / t, - 1 / t).

Thus, the line bundle [formula] restricted to Xt is precisely the line bundle, the triviality of which is required for spectral curves of monopoles (this remains true even for massless monopoles, i.e. when t =   ∞  ).

Once again, the line bundle L is essentially given in [\cite=A], although only its restrictions L|Xt are discussed there.

We now wish to relate convergence of hyperbolic monopoles to a Euclidean one to convergence of corresponding spectral curves.

Families of monopoles

To capture the limiting behaviour of hyperbolic monopoles as their mass tends to infinity, we use a parameterised version of the Atiyah-Hitchin-Ward correspondence [\cite=AW] [\cite=Hit1]. We consider the following manifold:

[formula]

together with the projection p:(x,y,z,t)  ↦  t. We equip the vertical bundle [formula] with the metric [\eqref=metric], where r = 1 / t. Thus, each fibre Ht = p- 1(t) is has constant curvature - t2. We shall consider vertical parts of other differential-geometric objects, e.g. vertical p-forms ΩpVH and vertical forms with values in a vector bundle [formula].

We observe that, since each Ht, t  ≠  0, is an upper half-space, we have chosen a preferred point on the ideal boundary of each hyperbolic space. Moreover, these points converge to a preferred point on the sphere at infinity of [formula]. It is given by the positive z-direction.

We also observe that the ideal boundary of each Ht varies smoothly with t, and so, we can add the sphere at infinity S2∞(t) for each t to obtain a smooth manifold with boundary, which we denote by [formula].

We can now consider the Atiyah-Hitchin-Ward correspondence in families. On the one hand, a family of monopoles on hyperbolic spaces of curvature - t2 (Euclidean for t = 0), of some differentiability class Cr in t (we include here Cω, i.e. analytic in t), can be viewed as an object defined on a principal SU(2)-bundle P over H: a pair [formula] consisting of a section Φ of [formula] and partial connection [formula] (if E is the associated rank 2 complex vector bundle, then [formula]), which define a monopole on each Ht. The Cr-dependence on t translates into [formula] and Φ being Cr with respect to t for t  ≥  0.

Moreover, since the Atiyah-Ward correspondence involves scattering along geodesics ([\cite=Hit1] [\cite=MS]), we must require that the boundary conditions on the sphere at infinity S2∞(t) also vary Cr with t. In other words, Φ|S2∞(t) and the U(1)-connection [formula] on S2∞(t) - the boundary value of a hyperbolic or Euclidean monopole (cf. [\cite=BA]) - must be Cr in t.

Families of spectral curves

The Atiyah-Hitchin-Ward correspondence associates to a monopole on Ht (which is H3t2 if t  ≠  0, and [formula] if t = 0) a holomorphic vector bundle Ẽ on Xt, trivial on curves of the form [\eqref=curve2], fitting into the following two exact sequences (over Xt):

[formula]

[formula]

The spectral curve S of the monopole is defined a subscheme where the two extensions coincide. Clearly, the line bundle L2(k, - k) is trivial on S. Furthermore, the (real) section of L2(k, - k)|S determines the above extensions, and consequently the monopole.

Going through the proofs in [\cite=Hit1] and [\cite=MS] shows that these constructions depend smoothly on t. Thus a Cr-family of framed monopoles with Cr boundary conditions, as described in the previous subsection, will produce a family of spectral curves St  ⊂  Xt together with section s(t) of L2(k, - k) also Cr in t. The inverse construction works as well. We can state the correspondence in a particularly elegant way, if we employ Nash's idea [\cite=Nash], of using the sections s(t) to lift spectral curves to the total space of L2(k, - k). To this end we shall denote by Zk the total space of L2(k, - k) over [formula] without the zero section, and by [formula] the composition of the projection Zk  →   and [formula]. We denote by τ the real structure on Zk induced by σ (which is defined on [formula]).

We write Z+k for p- 1{t  ≥  0}.

The Atiyah-Hitchin-Ward correspondence induces a 1-1 correspondence between

Cr (in t) families of framed monopoles, as described in the previous subsection, and

τ-invariant surfaces S in Z+k, Cr in the t-variable, and such that [formula] is a lift of a monopole spectral curve (i.e. it satisfies the additional conditions required of a curve in Xt to be the spectral curve of a monopole).

Convergence of pluricomplex structures

Pluricomplex structures

We briefly recall the definition and basic properties of a pluricomplex structure [\cite=BS].

Let V be a 2n-dimensional real vector space. Associated to V is its twistor space [formula], i.e. the space of complex structures on V. We denote by V1,0 the tautological i-eigenbundle over J(V). A pluricomplex structure is an embedding [formula] such that both [formula] and the quotient bundle [formula] split into line bundles of degree - 1. This forces n to be even.

To a pluricomplex structure one can associate a σ-sheaf F on [formula] by considering a second pluricomplex structure [formula] and the embedding

[formula]

of sheaves on [formula], where [formula] are the two projections. The sheaf F is defined as the cokernel of this map and called the characteristic sheaf of the pluricomplex structure F. Its (scheme-theoretic) support S is a compact curve in [formula], called the characteristic curve of K. A pluricomplex structure is hypercomplex if and only if S is the diagonal in [formula] (i.e. (S,OS)≃(Δ,OΔ)). Since both [formula] and [formula] split into O( - 1)'s, we can rewrite the exact sequence defining F as

[formula]

As shown in [\cite=BS], the map M(ζ,η) can be written (after fixing one complex structure) in the form

[formula]

and isomorphic pluricomplex structures correspond to orbits of such M under the action of [formula] given by

[formula]

The characteristic curve S is now defined (as set) by the equation

[formula]

In this setting, K is hypercomplex if and only if Y = 0 and X̄X =  - 1.

Limiting behaviour

Suppose that we have a sequence of pluricomplex structures on V converging to a hypercomplex structure. The characteristic curves will converge to the diagonal Δ in [formula], but there is additional data: if the tangent directions have a limit, then they will define a curve in [formula]. Similarly, we expect that the characteristic sheaves F will converge to a 1-dimensional sheaf on TΔ. In other words, we expect that a hypercomplex structure, which arises as a nontrivial limit of pluricomplex structures, carries more information than just the hypercomplex structure itself.

Let us be more precise. Let Kt, t∈I, be a family of pluricomplex structures Kt, where [formula] and 0 is an accumulation point of I. We suppose that K0 is a hypercomplex structure and Kt  →  K0 as t  →  0. In addition, we suppose that (Kt - K0) / t has a limit [formula] as t  →  0. Observe that A(ζ)∈TK0(ζ)J(V), i.e. A(ζ) anti-commutes with K0(ζ) for every ζ.

Using the matrix description of the previous subsection, let us identify Kt with pairs of matrices (Xt,Yt). Thus Y0 = 0 and X̄0X0 =  - 1. We write [formula], [formula]. Modulo t2, equation [\eqref=S] defining the characteristic curve can be rewritten as

[formula]

Replacing η  -  ζ = tw, and dividing the above by t, we see that the characteristic curves St converge to an [formula] defined by

[formula]

In other words, the characteristic curves define a "surface" in XI  =  π- 1(I)  ⊂  X, which is C1 at t = 0. To see the corresponding convergence of sheaves Ft, we observe that the characteristic sheaf of a pluricomplex structure K is also the cokernel of the map

[formula]

defined as the composition of the embedding into [formula] and the natural projection. If we rewrite this map in terms of X and Y, we shall obtain:

[formula]

where C(ζ,η) = (ηX̄  -  )(X + ζY) + ζI. Thus, for Xt,Yt as above,

[formula]

and the characteristic sheaves Ft converge to a sheaf F0 on [formula] defined as cokernel of this map.

We wish to formalise the above statements using the manifold X defined in section [\ref=sX]. In order to avoid talking about "sheaves which are C1 in t-variable", let us assume that I is an open interval and that Kt defines an analytic map [formula]. We can view K and other objects defined on I as living in the CR-category. We can the rephrase the above as follows.

Let [formula] be an open interval containing 0. There is 1-1 correspondence between

CR-maps [formula] such that K(0,  ·  ) is hypercomplex and K(t,  ·  ) is pluricomplex for t  ≠  0, and

coherent CR-σ-sheaves F on XI  =  π- 1(I)  ⊂  X such that, for every t∈I, F|Xt is 1-dimensional and

[formula]

where [formula], and O(a,b) has been defined at the beginning of §[\ref=conv1]. [formula]

The geometry of pluricomplex limits

As already mentioned above, a hypercomplex structure, which arises as a C1-limit of pluricomplex structure carries more information than just a triple of anticommuting structures. The limit [formula] of (Kt - K0) / t is a map from [formula], such that A(ζ)∈TK0(ζ)J(V), i.e. A(ζ) anti-commutes with K(ζ) for every ζ. Let us therefore adopt the following definition:

Let V be a vector space. An l-hypercomplex structure is a holomorphic map [formula] such that [formula] is a hypercomplex structure (here π:TJ(V)  →  J(V) is the base map).

In other words, an l-hypercomplex structure ("l" for limit) is a lift of a hypercomplex structure to TJ(V). Clearly, any hypercomplex structure defines trivially an l-hypercomplex structure (as a zero section), but the previous section shows that a limit of pluricomplex structures will usually be non-trivial.

Let us consider such an l-hypercomplex structure A, and denote by K the hypercomplex structure [formula]. We extend linearly A(ζ) to [formula] and consider the map [formula], obtained as restriction of A(ζ) composed with the natural projection (V1,0ζ consists of vectors of type (1,0) for K(ζ)). Thus, we obtain a bundle map [formula] over [formula].

In addition, if [formula], then L is a holomorphic line bundle over [formula], isomorphic to [formula]. We pull-back V1,0 and [formula] to the total space of L. Since any [formula], which anticommutes with K(ζ), maps V1,0ζ to V0,1ζ, we obtain a tautological map [formula] on [formula]. The map Ã  -  I on [formula] is an isomorphism for a generic fibre, and we obtain an exact sequence of sheaves:

[formula]

If K is written as in [\eqref=M], using matrices X,Y, so that A(ζ) is identified with P + ζQ for some n  ×  n complex matrices P,Q, then Ã has the form as in [\eqref=C]:

[formula]

and I is simply w, where w is the fibre coordinate of [formula]. Thus [\eqref=lF] can be rewritten as an exact sequence of sheaves on [formula]:

[formula]

Observe that Ã is compatible with the natural real structure, i.e. [formula]. We can show, similarly to [\cite=BS]:

There is a 1-1 correspondence between l-hypercomplex structures on [formula] and coherent 1-dimensional σ-sheaves F on [formula] such that h0(F) = 2n and [formula]. [formula]

As for pluricomplex structures, we call F the characteristic sheaf of an l-hypercomplex structure A and its support S the characteristic curve of A. The degree of A is the degree of S.

L-hypercomplex structures of degree 1 are simply hypercomplex structures; for higher degrees, however, they carry additional information.

We can recover A(ζ) from F as follows. The vector space V is identified with σ-invariant sections of F and the complex structure Jζ0 corresponding to [formula] is obtained via the isomorphism (evaluation) H0(F)σ≃H0(Dζ0,F), where Dζ0 is the divisor cut out by ζ  -  ζ0. Assume, for simplicity, that [formula] consists of distinct points [formula] in [formula]. According to the above discussion, we can identify [formula] with the complex line generated by complex structures Jζ anticommuting with Jζ0. If [formula] is one of those, then we can identify the points [formula] with [formula], for some complex numbers [formula]. We have:

[formula]

Let πi denote the projection onto the i-th direct summand H0({ui},F). Observe that each of these summands is Jζ0-invariant, and, hence, can be thought of as a complex subspace (for Jζ0). Then, for v∈V:

[formula]

Strongly integrable l-hypercomplex structures

We recall, from [\cite=BS], that a pluricomplex manifold M is called strongly integrable if M can be recovered as the parameter space of curves in a complex manifold Z fibreing over [formula], in such a way that the curve Cm corresponding to m∈M is a lift of the characteristic curve [formula] of the pluricomplex structure on TmM, and the normal bundle of Cm in Z is isomorphic to the characteristic sheaf Fm.

Similarly to the construction of Z in [\cite=BS], consider, for an l-hypercomplex manifold M, the following fibration over M:

[formula]

and the corresponding map [formula]. We shall assume that Y is smooth (it is certainly smooth whenever Sm is smooth) and that p is a submersion onto its image. For every [formula], we consider the subbundle T1,0ζM of vectors of type (1,0) for the complex structure K(ζ), and the bundle map [formula].

An l-hypercomplex structure A is said to be strongly integrable if [formula] is a subbundle of [formula] for all [formula] and the resulting distribution [formula] is involutive (i.e. ⊂  D). A manifold equipped with a strongly integrable l-hypercomplex structure will be called strongly l-hypercomplex.

The twistor space Z of a strongly integrable l-hypercomplex structure is the space of leaves [formula], where [formula].

Z is a holomorphic foliation, with a holomorphic map ρ:Z  →  TP1, induced by p. Moreover, Z has an antiholomorphic involution τ, which covers the involution σ, σ(ζ,w) = ( - 1 / ,  -    /  ζ2). Each characteristic curve Sm, m∈M, descends to Z and its normal bundle in Z is isomorphic to Fm.

As for pluricomplex structures [\cite=BS], we have:

Let Z be a complex manifold equipped with a holomorphic map [formula] and an antiholomorphic involution τ:Z  →  Z such that [formula]. Let C be a maximal connected subset of the Douady space HZ, consisting of complex subspaces S satisfying the following conditions:

ρ|S is a biholomorphism onto its image ρ(S), which is a compact divisor of O(2k) for some [formula];

the sheaf [formula] satisfies [formula]

Then C is a smooth manifold and its τ-invariant part M = Cτ is equipped with a natural strongly integrable l-hypercomplex structure. Moreover the twistor space of M is the corresponding open subset of Z. [formula]

Strongly integrable deformations

We can consider strongly integrable pluricomplex deformations of strongly integrable l-hypercomplex manifolds, similar to the linear deformation described in Proposition [\ref=families]. In order to state the precise result, we need a definition.

A strongly integrable pluricomplex deformation is an analytic manifold M, together with the following data:

An analytic submersion p:M  →  I, where I is an interval containing 0;

A CR-map [formula], such that K induces a strongly integrable pluricomplex structure on Mt = p- 1(t) for t  ≠  0, and a hypercomplex structure on M0 = p- 1(0). Moreover, [formula] is a strongly integrable l-hypercomplex structure on M0.

The following result follows from the definition and basic deformation theory.

There is a natural 1-1 correspondence between strongly integrable pluricomplex deformations p:M  →  I, and CR-submersions π:Z  →  I, equipped with a CR-map ρ:Z  →  XI  =  π- 1(I)  ⊂  X, and an antiholomorphic involution τ such that [formula]. [formula]

We can always extend everything into the complex domain, and so we can consider instead complex manifolds Z with a holomorphic submersion Z  →  D, where D is a neighborhood of I in [formula].

Geometry of monopoles revisited

Moduli spaces of monopoles fit very well into the above theory. The moduli space Mk of framed Euclidean SU(2)-monopoles of charge k has a strongly integrable l-hypercomplex structure. Its twistor space Zk is the total space of the line bundle L2 over [formula] without the zero section. The moduli space Mk is obtained as in Theorem [\ref=twistor], where the complex subspaces S are lifts of spectral curves of monopoles to Zk. Results of Nash [\cite=Nash] show that the conditions of this Theorem (in particular, the condition (ii) on the normal bundle) are satisfied.

The resulting l-hypercomplex structure on Mk is essentially described in [\eqref=AAA]. Fix ζ0 and identify the moduli space with based rational maps p(z) / q(z) of degree k. On the subset where the poles [formula] are distinct, we have local coordinates ηi,p(ηi), [formula]. The projection πi used in [\eqref=AAA] is simply the map p(z) / q(z)  ↦  (ηi,p(ηi)).

Furthermore, moduli spaces of hyperbolic monopoles with varying mass form a strongly integrable deformation of Mk, as defined in the previous subsection. On the one hand, we can, as in §[\ref=fm], define a smooth manifold Mk fibreing over [formula], such that the fibre over t is the moduli space of framed monopoles on the hyperbolic 3-space with curvature - 1 / t2. On the other hand, we have the complex manifold Zk, defined (§[\ref=fam]) as the total space of L(k, - k) over [formula] without the zero section, equipped with a fibration [formula]. We would like to say that Mk and Zk are an example of M and Z in Theorem [\ref=sZ], but at present we can only say this about their open subsets. The problem is that we do not know whether the pluricomplex structure on moduli spaces of hyperbolic monopoles is everywhere nonsingular. More precisely, we do not know whether the normal bundle N in p- 1(t) of a lift S of a spectral curve of a hyperbolic monopole always satisfies [formula] (cf. [\cite=BS] for partial results and discussion). Still, since the normal bundle of a lift of the spectral curve of a Euclidean monopole to p- 1(0) satisfies [formula] [\cite=Nash], it follows that there is an open neighbourhood of p- 1(0) in Zk where lifts of hyperbolic spectral curves satisfy [formula], i.e. the geometry is pluricomplex. Thus, there exist open neighbourhoods [formula] of the fibres over t = 0 in Mk and in Zk (i.e. of Mk and Zk) which correspond to M and Z in Theorem [\ref=sZ].

We finish with few words about the limit t  →    ∞  , i.e. when the mass of a monopole tends to zero. It has been shown in [\cite=BS] that the moduli space of massless monopoles of charge k is not pluricomplex. What happens is that the matrices X and Y defined in [\eqref=M] acquire singularities as t  →    ∞  . The limiting geometry is weaker than pluricomplex: in the notation of §[\ref=plu], it is given by an embedding [formula] such that [formula] still splits into line bundles of degree - 1, but the quotient bundle [formula] does not.
