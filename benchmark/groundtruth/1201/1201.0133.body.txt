Diffusion in infinite and semi-infinite lattices with long-range coupling

The physics of discrete systems have been a topic of interest for many years, because it can give rise to completely different phenomenology in comparison with that present in homogeneous continuous systems. In particular, discrete periodic systems are found in many different contexts including condensed matter physics, optics, Bose-Einstein condensates and magnetic metamaterials among others. Under the appropriate approximation, they can all be described by some variant of the discrete Schrödinger (DS) equation [\cite=rep]. In that way, many of these systems display the phenomenology common to periodic systems such as the presence of a band structure, discrete diffraction, Bloch oscillations, dynamic localization, Zener tunneling, to name a few.

Usually, the DS equation is used in the weak-coupling limit, where the interaction among sites includes nearest-neighbors only. This is a good approximation in cases where the coupling among sites decays very quickly with distance, like the exponentially-decreasing coupling found in optical waveguide arrays. However, there are cases where it is advisable to go beyond this approximation. An example of that is a split-ring resonator (SRR) array, where the interaction among the basic units is dipolar in nature and therefore, the coupling decreases as the inverse cubic power of the mutual distance.

When coupling beyond nearest-neighbors are considered, the number of possible routes of energy exchange increases. The dynamical evolution of excited pulses in finite 1D and 2D lattices with anisotropic couplings and up to second nearest-neighbor couplings, has been explored in [\cite=sza1] by means of the Green function formalism. Experimental observation of the influence of second order coupling in linear and nonlinear optical zig-zag waveguide arrays has been recently carried out [\cite=zz]. In a different context, a recent work [\cite=transition], shows that long-range coupling in low dimensional system can induce a phase transition from delocalized to localized modes. Another interesting scenario that can be modeled as a discrete system with long-range couplings is that of complex networks [\cite=networks], where the distances between nodes are not necessarily physical.

In this Letter we carry out an analytical and numerical study on the diffusion of an initially localized pulse propagating in a one-dimensional discrete periodic lattice, in the presence of arbitrary long-range couplings. We focus on two cases of interest: A delta-like pulse in the bulk, and a delta-like pulse at the edge of the lattice. The analytical work centers on the evaluation of the mean square displacement of the excitation, which is obtained in exact form for the bulk excitation, and in an approximate form for the edge excitation.

Let us consider the (dimensionless) discrete Schrödinger(DS) equation, describing the evolution of an excitation along a one-dimensional periodic lattice:

[formula]

where un is the complex amplitude of the excitation at the nth site, z is the evolution coordinate ('time' in the tight-binding model for electrons, or 'longitudinal distance' for coupled waveguide arrays in optics ). Matrix element Vn,m denotes the coupling between the nth and mth sites. This matrix is periodic in space and obeys Vn,m = Vm,n = V|n - m|. Eq. ([\ref=eq1]) conserves the norm [formula] which can then be set, without loss of generality, as unity, P = 1. The dispersion relation of the linear waves is obtained by inserting a solution of the form un = Aei(kn + λz) in Eq. (1), obtaining

[formula]

The convergence of this series for all k values constrains Vn to decrease faster than 1 / n. From Eq.([\ref=disp]) we immediately obtain some basic properties of λ(k): λ(k) = λ( - k), λ(k) = λ(k + 2πq),  q∈Z, and ∂kλ(k)|k = 0  =  ∂kλ(k)|k =   ±  π = 0.

The dynamical evolution of an initially localized pulse in a lattice, un(0) = A0δn,n0, can be monitored through the mean square displacement(MSD) of the excitation:

[formula]

where |n0|  ≫  0 and M =  -   ∞   for an infinite lattice, or n0 = 0 and M = 0 for a semi-infinite lattice.

Diffusion in the bulk. In this case un(0) = A0δn,n0, where n0 is far away from the boundaries of the lattice. By combining Fourier-and-Laplace transforms to Eq. (1), followed by the corresponding transformation back to space n and z coordinates, one obtains a formal expression for un(z)

[formula]

where λ(k) is the dispersion relation. Next we proceed to insert Eq.([\ref=generalsol]) into Eq.([\ref=msq_bulk]), and after using the general properties of λk, one obtains after some algebra:

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=msd]) implies that the propagation of the excitation is ballistic at all times, with a 'speed' that depends upon the smoothness of the dispersion relation. This result is also valid in any dimension d, where it can be easily proven that

[formula]

where the integral is taken over the first Brillouin zone (FBZ), with volume v. An equivalent expression to Eq. ([\ref=msd2]) in "real space" is obtained by replacing ([\ref=disp]) in ([\ref=msd2])

[formula]

where [formula] is the relative position if a lattice node from an arbitrary site [formula] taken here as [formula] without loss of generality because of periodicity, and [formula] is the coupling between sites [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is periodic in space and obeys: [formula].

Let us compute now in detail the MSD for several cases of interest.

(a)  Second-order coupling. In this case, V1 = V, V2  =  βV and Vi > 2 = 0, and the dispersion relation is λ  =  2V( cos (k) +  β cos (2k)). This implies, according to Eq.([\ref=msd])

[formula]

Thus, the inclusion of a second-order coupling (only) always increases the speed of the transversal diffusion.

(b)  Exponentially-decreasing coupling. In this case, Vn,m = Ve-  α(|n - m| - 1), where V is the coupling between nearest-neighbors sites and α is the long-range parameter. The linear dispersion relation is

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig1] shows some snapshots of the spatial transversal profiles at a given longitudinal propagation distance z, for different values of the dispersion parameter. We note that, at small α values, a fraction of the initial excitation seems to 'linger' at the initial position[\cite=sza1] [\cite=complex], in a short of quasi-selftrapping, while the "untrapped" portion propagates away from the initial site faster than in the nearest-neighbor case. These observations can be put on a more rigorous basis by computing the mean square displacement directly from Eq. ([\ref=msd]), using Eq. ([\ref=displr]). We obtain: [formula] where,

[formula]

This implies a ballistic speed g(α)  ≥  2, for all finite α. However, it only becomes noticeable larger than two for α  ≤  2 (Fig.  [\ref=fig2]).

(c)  Power-law coupling. Another popular case of long-range interaction is the power-law coupling Vn,m  =  V / |n - m|α. In this case the dispersion relation is given in terms of a polylogarithm function [formula] [formula]. For α = 1 we can explicitly written as

[formula]

with the logarithm diverges for k = 0. On the other hand, for α > 1 the polylogarithm remains bounded at |k|  ≤  π. Moreover, in this case we can use Eq. ([\ref=msd3]) to easily calculate the mean square displacement, obtaining

[formula]

where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. Figure [\ref=fig2] shows the "speed" of diffusion as a function of α and compares it with the "speed" obtained for lattices with exponentially-decreasing coupling. The discrete diffraction pattern (Fig.1) observed in case (b), is also observed in this case.

In all three cases examined, the speed of diffusion is greater than in the case with coupling to nearest-neighbors only. For the exponential and power-law cases, we note that as the range of the interaction is increased, the pulse experiences a sort of quasi-localization at the initial site. At the same time the speed g(α) increases above 2 and tends to diverge at α = 0 (Fig.2). We can understand this quasi-localization phenomenon by analyzing the dispersion relations more closely. In cases (b) and (c), as the range increases, the dispersion gets flatter and flatter in the vicinity of =    ±  π, signaling the emergence of linear modes with very small group velocities. As α is increased further, this vicinity grows and most of the linear modes acquire negligible velocity, with the exception of a small vicinity of k = 0, where the concavity is very high, giving rise to long wavelength modes with high velocity. Since our initial delta-like condition is a superposition of all these linear waves, the pseudo-localization phenomena can be understood as due to those modes with zero velocity, while those few and fast long wavelength modes, give rise to the wings that escape at high speed.

In the formal limit α = 0 and for a finite number of sites N, all sites are connected to one another, and the high degree of degeneracy forces the localization of the wave function through the execution of incomplete oscillations between the initial excited site and all the other ones. In this case the effective dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an asymmetric dimer[\cite=tetra]. This system has been solved in closed form and shows partial linear localization at the initial site for finite N, which becomes complete in the limit N  →    ∞  [\cite=complex].

Diffusion at the boundary. In this case un(0) = A0δn,0, i.e., the initial excitation is at the very edge of the lattice. This system can be viewed as an infinite lattice with boundary conditions: un(z) = 0 for n < 0, for all z. The lack of translational symmetry prevent us from writing a general expression for u(z), similar to Eq.([\ref=msd]). However, the case of nearest-neighbors coupling only, can be solved in closed form using the method of images[\cite=images]. The boundary conditions are obeyed if we placed an opposite delta-like source at n =  - 2. Then, the propagation for [formula] is then the superposition of the evolution of both sources

[formula]

where index s denotes a semi-infinite array. However, When long-range couplings are considered, it is no longer possible to satisfy the boundary conditions by the images method. The reason has to do with the fact that, even though we have u- 1(z)  =  0 for all z, the fields of each semi-infinite arrays are still coupled by the range of the interaction.

However, by comparing the predictions of Eq.([\ref=solsup]) with numerical results for the dynamical evolution, we find that Eq.([\ref=solsup]) still provides a good approximation to the general case, by just substituting the corresponding dispersion relation for a given long-range coupling. After using general properties of the dispersion relation, one obtains an asymptotic expression

[formula]

valid for z  ≫  1.

As expected, the asymptotic behavior is ballistic in all cases, after some transient time, related to the repulsive effect of the boundary. Equation ([\ref=msdsur]) can also be expressed in real space, by replacing Eq.([\ref=msd3]) in Eq. ([\ref=msdsur]), obtaining

[formula]

This results are confirmed by direct computations of cases (a), (b) and (c), using 'exact' Eq.(msdsur) with an edge excitation as an initial condition, and comparing it with the asymptotic formulas. Fig.[\ref=fig4] shows this comparison of the MSD for the exponentially-decreasing coupling case. In this case, the asymptotic behavior is

[formula]

In Fig. ([\ref=fig5]) we show a comparison between this approximation and the numerical results. We see that for [formula] there is a good correspondence between the numerical and analytical approach, while for α  ≤  1, the exact solution for the bulk, Eq. ([\ref=g]), constitutes a better fit than the surface approximation, Eq.([\ref=approx]). This is understandable because in the long-range coupling regimen, the boundary loses its meaning as such and the edge site behaves effectively like a bulk site.

In conclusion, we have examined the propagation of an excitation initially placed in the bulk and at the boundary of a one-dimensional lattice with long-range coupling. For the bulk case, we find a closed-form expression showing that the propagation is ballistics at all times, while for the edge excitation, we obtain an asymptotic approximation based on the method of images, that predicts ballistic propagation at long times, in agreement with numerical results.
