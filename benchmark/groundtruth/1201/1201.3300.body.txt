On the linearity of higher-dimensional blocking sets

Keywords: blocking set, linear set, linearity conjecture

Introduction and preliminaries

If [formula] is a vectorspace, then we denote the corresponding projective space by [formula]. If [formula] has dimension n over the finite field [formula], with q elements, q = pt, p prime, then we also write [formula] as [formula] and [formula] as [formula]. A k-dimensional space will be called a k-space.

A k-blocking set in [formula] is a set B of points such that every (n - k)-space of [formula] contains at least one point of B. A k-blocking set B is called small if |B| < 3(qk + 1) / 2 and minimal if no proper subset of B is a k-blocking set. The points of a k-space of [formula] form a k-blocking set, and every k-blocking set containing a k-space is called trivial. Every small minimal k-blocking set B in [formula], p prime, has an exponent e, defined to be the largest integer for which every (n - k)-space intersects B in 1 mod pe points. The fact that every small minimal k-blocking set has an exponent e  ≥  1 follows from a result of Sznyi and Weiner and will be explained in Section 2. A minimal k-blocking set B in [formula] is of Rédei-type if there exists a hyperplane containing |B| - qk points of B; this is the maximum number possible if B is small and spans [formula]. For a long time, all constructed small minimal k-blocking sets were of Rédei-type, and it was conjectured that all small minimal k-blocking sets must be of Rédei-type. In 1998, Polito and Polverino [\cite=polito] used a construction of Lunardon [\cite=Lunardon] to construct small minimal linear blocking sets that were not of Rédei-type, disproving this conjecture. Soon people conjectured that all small minimal k-blocking sets in [formula] must be linear. In 2008, the 'Linearity conjecture' was for the first time formally stated in the literature, by Sziklai [\cite=sziklai].

A point set S in [formula], where [formula] is an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over [formula], is called linear if there exists a subset U of [formula] that forms an [formula]-vector space for some [formula], such that S = B(U), where

[formula]

If we want to specify the subfield we call S an [formula]-linear set (of [formula]).

We have a one-to-one correspondence between the points of [formula] and the elements of a Desarguesian (h - 1)-spread D of [formula]. This gives us a different view on linear sets; namely, an [formula]-linear set is a set S of points of [formula] for which there exists a subspace π in [formula] such that the points of S correspond to the elements of D that have a non-empty intersection with π. We identify the elements of D with the points of [formula], so we can view B(π) as a subset of D, i.e.

[formula]

If we want to denote the element of D corresponding to the point P of [formula], we write S(P), analogously, we denote the set of elements of D corresponding to a subspace H of [formula], by S(H). For more information on this approach to linear sets, we refer to [\cite=linearsets].

To avoid confusion, subspaces of [formula] will be denoted by capital letters, while subspaces of [formula] will be denoted by lower-case letters.

The following well-known property will be used throughout this paper: if B(π) is an [formula]-linear set in [formula], where π is a d-dimensional subspace of [formula], then for every point x in [formula], contained in an element of B(π), there is a d-dimensional space π', through x, such that B(π) = B(π'). This is a direct consequence of the fact that the elementwise stabilisor of D in [formula] acts transitively on the points of one element of D.

To our knowledge, the Linearity conjecture for k-blocking sets B in [formula], p prime, is still open, except in the following cases:

t = 1 (for n = 2, see [\cite=blok]; for n > 2, this is a corollary of Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (i));

t = 2 (for n = 2, see [\cite=TS:97]; for k = 1, see [\cite=Storme-Weiner]; for k  ≥  1, see [\cite=bokler] and [\cite=weiner]);

t = 3 (for n = 2, see [\cite=pol]; for k = 1, see [\cite=Storme-Weiner]; for k  ≥  1, see [\cite=LC] and independently [\cite=nora],[\cite=nora1]);

B is of Rédei-type (for n = 2, see [\cite=redei2]; for n > 2, see [\cite=redei]);

B spans an tk-dimenional space (see [\cite=sz]).

It should be noted that in [formula], for t = 1,2,3, all small minimal blocking sets are of Rédei-type. Storme and Weiner show in [\cite=Storme-Weiner] that small minimal 1-blocking sets in [formula], t = 2,3, are of Rédei-type too. The proofs rely on the fact that for t = 2,3, small minimal blocking sets in [formula] are listed. The special case k = 1 in Main Theorem 1 of this paper shows that using the (assumed) linearity of planar small minimal blocking sets, it is possible to prove the linearity of small minimal 1-blocking sets in [formula], which reproofs the mentioned statements of Storme and Weiner in the cases t = 2,3.

The techniques developed in [\cite=LC] to show the linearity of k-blocking sets in [formula], using the linearity of 1-blocking sets in [formula], can be modified to apply for general t. This will be Main Theorem 2 of this paper. In particular, this theorem reproofs the results of [\cite=weiner], [\cite=LC], [\cite=nora], [\cite=nora1].

In this paper, we prove the following main theorems. Recall that the exponent e of a small minimal k-blocking set is the largest integer such that every (n - k)-space meets in 1 mod pe points. Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (i) will assure that the exponent of a small minimal blocking set is at least 1.

In particular, this shows that if the linearity conjecture holds in the plane, it holds for all small minimal 1-blocking sets with exponent e in [formula], pe  ≥  7.

Combining the two main theorems yields the following corollary.

If the linearity conjecture holds in the plane, it holds for all small minimal k-blocking sets with exponent e in [formula], n > k, p prime, pe  ≥  t / e + 11.

Previous results

In this section, we list a few results on the linearity of small minimal k-blocking sets and on the size of small k-blocking sets that will be used throughout this paper. The first of the following theorems of Sznyi and Weiner has the linearity of small minimal k-blocking sets in projective spaces over prime fields as a corollary.

Let B be a k-blocking set in [formula], q = pt, p prime.

[\cite=sz] If B is small and minimal, then B intersects every subspace of [formula] in 1 mod p or zero points.

[\cite=sz] If |B|  ≤  2qk and every (n - k)-space intersects B in 1 mod p points, then B is minimal.

[\cite=sz] If B is small and minimal, then the projection of B from a point Q∉B onto a hyperplane H skew to Q is a small minimal k-blocking set in H.

[\cite=sz] The size of a non-trivial k-blocking set in [formula], p prime, with exponent e, is at least [formula].

Part (iv) of the previous theorem gives a lower bound on the size of a k-blocking set. In this paper, we will work with the following, weaker, lower bound.

The size of a non-trivial k-blocking set in [formula], p prime, with exponent e, is at least ptk + ptk - e - ptk - 2e.

If a blocking set B in [formula] is [formula]-linear, then every line intersects B in an [formula]-linear set. If B is small, many of these [formula]-linear sets are [formula]-sublines (i.e. [formula]-linear sets of rank 2). The following theorem of Sziklai shows that for all small minimal blocking sets, this property holds.

[\cite=sziklai] If B is a small minimal blocking set in [formula], with |B| = q + κ, then the number of (p0 + 1)-secants to B through a point P of B lying on a (p0 + 1)-secant to B, is at least

[formula]

[\cite=sziklai] Let B be a small minimal blocking set with exponent e in [formula]. If for a certain line L, [formula], then [formula] is a subfield of [formula] and [formula] is [formula]-linear.

The next theorem, by Lavrauw and Van de Voorde, determines the intersection of an [formula]-subline with an [formula]-linear set; all possibilities for the size of the intersection that are obtained in this statement, can occur (see [\cite=linearsets]). The bound on the characteristic of the field appearing in Main Theorem 2 arises from this theorem.

An [formula]-linear set of rank k in [formula] and an [formula]-subline (i.e. an [formula]-linear set of rank 2), intersect in [formula] or p0 + 1 points.

The following lemma is a straightforward extension of [\cite=LC], where the authors proved it for h = 3.

If B is a subset of [formula], p0  ≥  7, intersecting every (n - k)-space, k  ≥  1, in 1 mod p0 points, and Π is an (n - k + s)-space, s < k, then either

[formula]

or

[formula]

Furthermore, |B| < phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30.

Let Π be an (n - k + s)-space of [formula], s  ≤  k, and put [formula]. Let xi denote the number of (n - k)-spaces of Π intersecting BΠ in i points. Counting the number of (n - k)-spaces, the number of incident pairs (P,Σ) with P∈BΠ,P∈Σ,Σ an (n - k)-space, and the number of triples (P1,P2,Σ), with P1,P2∈BΠ, P1  ≠  P2, P1,P2∈Σ, Σ an (n - k)-space yields:

[formula]

Since we assume that every (n - k)-space intersects B in 1 mod p0 points, it follows that every (n - k)-space of Π intersect BΠ in 1 mod p0 points, and hence [formula]. Using Equations (1), (2), and (3), this yields that

[formula]

[formula]

Putting |BΠ| = phs0 + phs - 10 + phs - 20 + 3phs - 30 in this inequality, with [formula], gives a contradiction; putting |BΠ| = phs + 10 - phs - 10 - phs - 20 - 3phs - 30 in this inequality, with [formula], gives a contradiction if s < k. For s = k, it is sufficient to note that when |B| is the size of a k-space, the inequality holds, to deduce that |B| < phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30. The statement follows.

Let B be a subset of [formula], p0  ≥  7, intersecting every (n - k)-space, k  ≥  1, in 1 mod p0 points. From now on, we call an (n - k + s)-space small if it meets B in less than phs0 + phs - 10 + phs - 20 + 3phs - 30 points, and large if it meets B in more than phs + 10 - phs - 10 - phs - 20 - 3phs - 30 points, and it follows from the previous lemma that each (n - k + s)-space is either small or large.

The following Lemma and its corollaries show that if all (n - k)-spaces meet a k-blocking set B in 1 mod p0 points, then every subspace that intersects B, intersects it in 1 mod p0 points.

Let B be a small minimal k-blocking set in [formula] and let L be a line such that [formula] For all [formula] there exists an i-space πi through L such that [formula].

It follows from Theorem [\ref=szonyi] that every subspace through L intersects [formula] in zero or at least p points, where p0 = pe, p prime. We proceed by induction on the dimension i. The statement obviously holds for i = 1. Suppose there exists an i-space Πi through L such that [formula]=[formula], with i  ≤  n - k - 1. If there is no (i + 1)-space intersecting B only in points of L, then the number of points of B is at least

[formula]

but by Lemma [\ref=groottes] |B|  ≤  phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + phk - 30. If i < n - k this is a contradiction. We may conclude that there exists an i-space Πi through L such that [formula], [formula].

Using Lemma [\ref=e], the following corollaries follow easily.

Every line meets a small minimal k-blocking set in [formula], p prime, with exponent e in 1 mod pe or zero points.

Suppose the line L meets the small minimal k-blocking set in x points, where 1  ≤  x  ≤  pt. By Lemma [\ref=e], the line L is contained in an (n - k)-space π such that [formula]. Since every (n - k)-space meets the k-blocking set B with exponent e in 1 mod pe points, the corollary follows.

By considering all lines through a certain point of B in some subspace, we get the following corollary.

Every subspace meets a small minimal k-blocking set in [formula], p prime, with exponent e in 1 mod pe or zero points.

On the (p0 + 1)-secants to a small minimal k-blocking set

In this section, we show that Theorem [\ref=sziklai] on planar blocking sets can be extended to a similar result on k-blocking sets in [formula].

Let B be a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p0: = pe  ≥  7, p prime, [formula]. The number of points, not in B, that do not lie on a secant line to B is at least

[formula]

and this number is larger than the number of points in [formula].

By Corollary [\ref=rechte1modp], the number of secant lines to B is at most [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma5], the number of points in B is at most phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30, hence the number of secant lines is at most p2hk - 20 + 2p2hk - 30. This means that the number of points on at least one secant line is at most (p2hk - 20 + 2p2hk - 30)(ph0 + 1). It follows that the number of points in [formula], not in B, not on a secant to B is at least (ph(n + 1)0 - 1) / (ph0 + 1) - (p2hk - 20 + 2p2hk - 30)(ph0 + 1) - phk0 - phk - 10 - phk - 20 - 3phk - 30. Since we assume that n  ≥  2k + 1 and p0  ≥  7, the last part of the statement follows.

We first extend Theorem [\ref=sziklai] (i) to 1-blocking sets in [formula].

A point of a small minimal 1-blocking set B with exponent e in [formula], p0: = pe  ≥  7, p prime, lying on a (p0 + 1)-secant, lies on at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 + 1 (p0 + 1)-secants.

We proceed by induction on the dimension n. If n = 2, by Theorem [\ref=sziklai], the number of (p0 + 1)-secants through P is at least q / p0 - 3(κ - 1) / p0 + 2, where |B| = q + κ. By Lemma [\ref=lemma5], κ is at most ph - 10 + ph - 20 + 3ph - 30, which means that the number of (p0 + 1)-secants is at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 + 1. This proves the statement for n = 2.

Now assume n  ≥  3. From Lemma [\ref=lemma6] (observe that, since n  ≥  3 and k = 1, n  ≥  2k + 1), we know that there is a point Q, not lying on a secant line to B. Project B from the point Q onto a hyperplane through P and not through Q. It is clear that the number of (p0 + 1)-secants through P to the projection of B is the number of (p0 + 1)-secants through P to B. By the induction hypothesis, this number is at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 + 1.

Let Π be an (n - k)-space of [formula], k > 1, p0  ≥  7. If Π intersects a small minimal k-blocking set B with exponent e in [formula], p0: = pe  ≥  7, p prime in p0 + 1 points, then there are at most 3phk - h - 30 large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π.

Suppose there are y large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π. A small (n - k + 1)-space through Π meets B clearly in a small 1-blocking set, which is in this case, non-trivial and hence, by Theorem [\ref=grootte], has at least ph0 + ph - 10 - ph - 20 points.

Then the number of points in B is at least

[formula]

[formula]

which is at most phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30. This yields y  ≤  3phk - h - 30.

A point of a small minimal k-blocking set B with exponent e in [formula], p0: = pe  ≥  7, p prime, k > 1, lying on a (p0 + 1)-secant, lies on at least ((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1 (p0 + 1)-secants.

Let P be a point on a (p0 + 1)-secant L. By Lemma [\ref=e], there is an (n - k)-space Π through L such that [formula]. Let Σ be a small (n - k + 1)-space. It is clear that the space Σ meets B in a small 1-blocking set B'. Every (n - k)-space contained in Σ meets B' in 1 mod p0 points. By Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (ii), B' is a small minimal 1-blocking set in Σ. For every small (n - k + 1)-space Σi through π, P is a point in Σi, lying on a (p0 + 1)-secant in Σi, and hence, by Lemma [\ref=lemma1], P lies on at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 + 1 (p0 + 1)-secants to B in Σi. From Lemma [\ref=large], we get that the number of small (n - k + 1)-spaces Σi through Π is at least (phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30, hence, the number of (p0 + 1)-secants to B through P is at least ((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1.

We will now show that Theorem [\ref=sziklai] (ii) can be extended to k-blocking sets in [formula]. We start with the case k = 1.

Let B be a small minimal 1-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], q = pt. If for a certain line L, [formula], then [formula] is a subfield of [formula] and [formula] is [formula]-linear.

We proceed by induction on n. For n = 2, the statement follows from Theorem [\ref=linrechte] (ii), hence, let n > 2. Let L be a line, meeting B in pe + 1 points and let H be a hyperplane through L. A plane through L containing a point of B, not on L, contains at least p2e points of B, not on L by Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (i). If all qn - 2 planes through L, not in H, contain an extra point of B, then |B|  ≥  p2eqn - 2, which is larger than ph + ph - 1 + ph - 2 + 3ph - 3, a contradiction by Lemma [\ref=groottes]. Let Q be a point on a plane π through L, not in H such that π meets B only in points of L. The projection of B onto H is a small minimal 1-blocking set B' in H (see Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (iii)), for which L is a (pe + 1)-secant. The intersection [formula] is by the induction hypothesis an [formula]-linear set. Since [formula], the statement follows.

Finally, we extend Theorem [\ref=sziklai] (ii) to a theorem on k-blocking sets in [formula].

Let B be a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], q = pt. If for a certain line L, [formula], pe  ≥  7, then [formula] is a subfield of [formula] and [formula] is [formula]-linear.

Let L be a pe + 1-secant to B. By Lemma [\ref=large], there is at least one small (n - k + 1)-space Π through L. Since [formula] is a small 1-blocking set to B, and every (n - k)-space, contained in Π meets B in 1 mod pe points, by Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (ii), B is minimal. By Lemma [\ref=pplus1], [formula] is an [formula]-linear set.

The proof of Main Theorem 1

In this section, we will prove Main Theorem 1, that, roughly speaking, states that if we can prove the linearity for k-blocking sets in [formula] for a certain value of n, then it is true for all n. It is clear from the definition of a k-blocking set that we can only consider k-blocking sets in [formula] where 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, and whenever we use the notation k-blocking set in [formula], we assume that the above condition is satisfied.

From now on, if we want to state that for the pair (k,n*), all small minimal k-blocking sets in [formula] are linear, we say that the condition (Hk,n*) holds.

To prove Main Theorem 1, we need to show that if ([formula] holds, then (Hk,n) holds for all n  ≥  k + 1. The following observation shows that we only have to deal with the case [formula].

If ([formula] holds, then (Hk,n) holds for all n with [formula].

A small minimal k-blocking set B in [formula], with [formula], can be embedded in [formula], in which it clearly is a small minimal k-blocking set. Since ([formula]) holds, B is linear, hence, (Hk,n) holds.

The main idea for the proof of Main Theorem 1 is to prove that all the (p0 + 1)-secants through a particular point P of a k-blocking set B span a hk-dimensional space μ over [formula], and to prove that the linear blocking set defined by μ is exactly the k-blocking set B.

Assume (Hk,n - 1) and n - 1  ≥  2k, and let B denote a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, pe  ≥  7, t  ≥  2. Let Π be a plane in [formula].

There is a 3-space Σ through Π meeting B only in points of Π and containing a point Q not lying on a secant line to B if [formula].

The intersection [formula], is a linear set if [formula].

Let Π be a plane of [formula], p0: = pe  ≥  7. By Lemma [\ref=lemma6], there are at least

[formula]

points Q∉{B} not lying on a secant line to B. This means that there are at least r: = (s - (p2h0 + ph0 + 1)) / p3h0 3-spaces through Π that contain a point that does not lie on a secant line to B and is not contained in B nor in Π. If all r 3-spaces contain a point Q of B that is not contained in Π, then the number of points in B is at least r. It is easy to check that this is a contradiction if n - 1  ≥  2k, pe  ≥  7, and k > 2.

Hence, there is a 3-space Σ through Π meeting B only in points of Π and containing a point Q not lying only on a secant line to B. The projection of B from Q onto a hyperplane containing Π is a small minimal k-blocking set [formula] in [formula] (see Theorem [\ref=szonyi](iii)), which is, by (Hk,n - 1), a linear set. Now [formula], since the space 〈Q,π〉 meets B only in points of Π, and hence, the set [formula] is linear.

Assume (Hk,n - 1), k > 2, (n - 1)  ≥  2k and let B denote a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, pe  ≥  7, t  ≥  2. The intersection of a line with B is an [formula]-linear set.

The linear set B(μ) does not determine the subspace μ in a unique way; by Remark [\ref=trans], we can choose μ through a fixed point S(P), with P∈B(μ). Note that there may exist different spaces μ and μ', through the same point of [formula], such that B(μ) = B(μ'). If μ is a line, however, if we fix a point x of an element of B(μ), then there is a unique line μ' through x such that B(μ) = B(μ') since, in this case, μ' is the unique transversal line through x to the regulus B(μ). This observation is crucial for the proof of the following lemma.

Assume (Hk,n - 1), n - 1  ≥  2k, and let B be a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7. Denote the (p0 + 1)-secants through a point P of B that lies on at least one (p0 + 1)-secant, by [formula]. Let x be a point of S(P) and let [formula] be the line through x such that [formula]. The following statements hold:

The space [formula] has dimension hk.

[formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  s.

(i) Let P be a point of B lying on a (p0 + 1)-secant, and let H be a hyperplane through P. By Lemma 6, there is a point Q, not in B and not in H, not lying on a secant line to B. The projection of B from Q onto H is a small minimal k-blocking set [formula] in [formula] (Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (iii)). By (Hk,n - 1), [formula] is a linear set. Every line meets B in 1 mod p0 or 0 points, which implies that every line in H meets [formula] in 1 mod p0 or 0 points, hence, [formula] is [formula]-linear. Take a fixed point x in S(P). Since [formula] is an [formula]-linear set, there is an hk-dimensional space μ in [formula], through x, such that B(μ) = .

From Lemma [\ref=lemma1], we get that the number of (p0 + 1)-secants through P to B is at least z: = ((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1, denote them by [formula] and let [formula] be the lines through x such that [formula]. These lines exist by Theorem [\ref=pplus1k]. Note that, by Remark [\ref=rem2], [formula] determines the line [formula] through x in a unique way, and that [formula] for all i  ≠  j.

We will prove that the projection of [formula] from S(Q) onto 〈S(H)〉 in [formula] is contained in μ. Since L1 is projected onto a (p0 + 1)-secant M to [formula] through P, there is a line m through x in [formula] such that [formula]. Now   =  B(μ), and [formula], hence, there is a line m' through x in μ such that [formula]. Since m is the unique transversal line through x to [formula] (see Remark [\ref=rem2]), m = m', and m is contained in μ.

This implies that the space [formula] is contained in 〈S(Q),μ〉, hence, W has dimension at most hk + h. Suppose that W has dimension at least hk + 1, then it intersects the (h - 1)-dimensional space S(Q) in at least a point. But this holds for all S(Q) corresponding to points, not in B, such that Q does not lie on a secant line to B. This number is at least

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma6], which is larger than the number of points in W, since W is at most (hk + h)-dimensional, a contradiction.

From Theorem [\ref=aantalsecanten], we get that W contains at least

[formula]

points, which is larger than (phk0 - 1) / (p0 - 1) if p0  ≥  7, hence, W is at least hk-dimensional. Since we have already shown that W is at most hk-dimensional, the statement follows.

(ii) W.l.o.g. we choose i = 1,j = 2. Let m be a line in [formula], not through [formula]. Let M be the line of [formula] containing B(m) and let H be a hyperplane of [formula] containing the plane 〈L1,L2〉. We claim that there exists a point Q, not in H, such that the planes 〈Q,L1〉,〈Q,L2〉 and 〈Q,M〉 only contain points of B that are in H.

If k > 2, this follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma9](i). Now assume that 1  ≤  k  ≤  2. There are qn - 2 planes through M, not in in H. Since M is at least a (p0 + 1)-secant (Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (i)), it holds that if a plane Π through M contains a point of B, that is not contained in M, then, Π contains at least p20 points of B, not in M (again by Theorem [\ref=szonyi](i)). Since |B|  ≤  qk + qk - 1 + qk - 2 + 3qk - 3 (Lemma [\ref=groottes]), and n - 1  ≥  2k, there is at least one plane Π through M, not contained in H that contains only points of B that are contained in M. Now, there is one of the q2 points in Π, say Q, that is not contained in M for which the planes 〈Q,Li〉, i = 1,2 only contain points of B on the line Li, i = 1,2, since otherwise, the number of points in B would be at least p20q2, a contradiction since k  ≤  2 and |B|  ≤  qk + qk - 1 + qk - 2 + 3qk - 3 by Lemma [\ref=groottes]. This proves our claim.

The projection of B from Q onto H is a small minimal k-blocking set [formula] in [formula] (Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (iii)). By (Hk,n - 1), [formula] is a linear set, hence, it meets 〈L1,L2〉 in a linear set. This means that there is a space π through x such that [formula]. Note that, since 〈Q,L1〉 and 〈Q,L2〉 only contain points of B that are contained in H, the lines L1 and L2 are (p0 + 1)-secants to [formula].

Hence, the space π contains [formula] since [formula] and [formula] is the unique transversal line to the regulus [formula], i = 1,2. Hence, [formula], so B(m)  ⊂  . The plane 〈Q,M〉 only contains points of B that are on M, so [formula], hence, B(m)  ⊂  B. Since every point of [formula], not on [formula], lies on a line m meeting [formula] and [formula] in different points, [formula].

Proof of Main Theorem 1.

Let B be a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0 = pe  ≥  7 and assume that (Hk,n - 1) holds with n - 1  ≥  2k. Let P be a point of B, lying on a (p0 + 1)-secant. By Theorem [\ref=aantalsecanten], there are at least ((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1 (p0 + 1)-secants [formula] through P, and by Lemma [\ref=span], the corresponding lines [formula] in [formula], with [formula], [formula] through a fixed point x of S(P), span an hk-dimensional space W. Suppose that [formula], and let w be a point of W for which B(w)∉B. Since the number of points lying on one of the lines of the set [formula], is at least (((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1)p0 + 1, at least one of the (phk0 - 1) / (p0 - 1) lines through w, say m, contains two points lying on one of the lines of the set [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=span] (b), B(m) is contained in B, a contradiction since B(w)∈B(m), and B(w)∉B.

Hence, B(W)  ⊆  B, and since B(W) is a small minimal linear k-blocking set [formula], contained in the minimal k-blocking set B, B equals the linear set B(W). Hence, we have shown that if (Hk,n - 1) holds, with n - 1  ≥  2k, then (Hk,n) holds, and repeating this argument shows that if (Hk,n*) holds for some n*, then (Hk,n) holds for all n  ≥  n*. Since Lemma [\ref=simpel] shows the desired property for all n with k + 1  ≤  n  ≤  n*, the statement follows.

The proof of Main Theorem 2

In this section, we will prove Main Theorem 2, stating that, if all small minimal 1-blocking sets in [formula] are linear, then all small minimal k-blocking sets in [formula], are linear, provided a condition on p0 and h holds.

We proved in Lemma [\ref=groottes] that a subspace meets the small minimal k-blocking set B in either in a 'small' number, or in a 'large' number of points. To simplify the terminology, we call a (n - k + s)-space Π, s  ≤  k, for which [formula] points, a small (n - k + s)-space. An (n - k + s)-space which is not small is called large.

Let Π be an (n - k)-space of [formula] and let B be a small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7, k > 1.

If [formula] is a point, then there are at most phk - h - 20 + 4phk - h - 30 - 1 large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π.

If Π intersects B in p0 + 1 points, then there are at most 3phk - h - 30 large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π.

(i) A small (n - k + 1)-space through Π meets B in at least ph0 + 1 points. Suppose there are y large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π. Then the number of points in B is at least

[formula]

which is at most phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30. This yields y  ≤  phk - h - 20 + 4phk - h - 30 - 1.

(ii) Suppose there are y large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π. A small (n - k + 1)-space through Π meets B in a linear 1-blocking set, which is in this case, non-trivial and hence, by Theorem [\ref=grootte], has at least ph0 + ph - 10 - ph - 20 points.

Then the number of points in B is at least

[formula]

[formula]

which is at most phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30. This yields y  ≤  3phk - h - 30.

If B is a non-trivial small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7, k > 1, then there exist a point P∈B, a tangent (n - k)-space Π at the point P and small (n - k + 1)-spaces Hi, through Π, such that there is a (p0 + 1)-secant through P in Hi, [formula].

Let L be a (p0 + 1)-secant to B and let P be a point of [formula]. Lemma [\ref=e] shows that there is an (n - k)-space ΠL such that [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=aantalsecanten], P lies on ((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1 other (p0 + 1)-secants. By Lemma [\ref=hypervlakken] (ii), there are at least (phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30 small hyperplanes through ΠL, which each contain at least ph0 + ph - 10 - ph - 20 - p0 - 1 points of B not on L. Since |B| < phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30 (see Lemma [\ref=grootte]), there are less than 2phk - 10 points of B left in large (n - k + 1)-spaces through ΠL. Hence, P lies on less than 2phk - h - 10 lines that are completely contained in B.

Since B is minimal, P lies on a tangent (n - k)-space Π to B. There are at most phk - h - 20 + 4phk - h - 30 - 1 large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π (Lemma [\ref=hypervlakken] (i)). Moreover, since at least [formula] (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π contain at least ph0 + ph - 10 - ph - 20 points of B, and at most 2phk - h - 10 of the small (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π contain exactly ph0 + 1 points of B, there are at most phk - 20 points of B contained in large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π. Hence, P lies on at most phk - 30 (p0 + 1)-secants of the large (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π. This implies that there are at least (((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 3phk - h - 30)(ph - 10 - 4ph - 20) + 1) - phk - 30 (p0 + 1)-secants through P left in small (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π. Since in a small (n - k + 1)-space through Π, there can lie at most (ph0 - 1) / (p0 - 1) (p0 + 1)-secants through P, this implies that there are at least phk - h0 - 5phk - h - 10 (n - k + 1)-spaces Hi through Π such that P lies on a (p0 + 1)-secant in Hi.

We continue with the following hypothesis:

A small minimal j-blocking set in [formula], 1  ≤  j < k is linear.

Let B be a non-trivial small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7, k > 1. If we assume (H), then the following statements hold.

A small (n - k + s)-dimensional space Π of [formula], s < k, intersects B in a linear set and [formula].

Let L be a (p0 + 1)-secant to B and let S be a point of B, not on L. There exists a small (n - 2)-space through L, skew to S.

A line intersects B in a linear set.

Let Π be a small (n - 2)-space containing a (p0 + 1)-secant to B. Then the number of large (n - 1)-spaces through Π is at most 4ph - 30.

(i) It is clear that an (n - k + s)-space Π meets B in a small s-blocking set B'. Every (n - k)-space contained in Π meets B' in 1 mod p0 points, hence, by Theorem [\ref=szonyi] (ii), B' is a small minimal s-blocking set in [formula], which is, by the hypothesis (H), [formula]-linear. It follows that |B'|  ≤  (phs + 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1).

(ii) Lemma [\ref=e] shows that there is an (n - k)-space Πn - k through L, such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=groottes], an (n - k + 1)-space through Πn - k contains at most (ph + 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1) or at least ph + 10 - ph - 10 - ph - 20 - 3ph - 30 points of B. If all (n - k + 1)-spaces through Πn - k (except possibly 〈Πn - k,S〉) would be large, the number of points in B would be at least ((phk0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 1)(ph + 10 - ph - 10 - ph - 20 - 3ph - 30 - ph0), which is larger than phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30, a contradiction. Hence, there is a small (n - k + 1)-space through Πn - k.

Suppose, by induction, that there exists a small (n - k + s)-space Πn - k + s through L, skew to S and suppose all (ph(k - s)0 - 1) / (ph0 - 1) - 1 (n - k + s)-spaces through Πn - k + s - 1, different from 〈Πn - k + s,S〉 are large. Then the number of points in B is larger than phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30 if s  ≤  k - 2, a contradiction. We conclude that there exists a small (n - 2)-space through L, skew to S.

(iii) Let L be a line, with [formula], otherwise the statement trivially holds. The previous part of this lemma shows that L is contained in a small (n - k + 1)-space, which has, by the first part of this lemma, a linear intersection with B. Hence, [formula] is a linear set.

(iv) A small (n - 1)-space through Π meets B in at least phk - h0 + phk - h - 1 - phk - h - 2 points (see Corollary [\ref=grootte]) and a small (n - 2)-space contains at most (phk - 2h + 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1) points by the first part of this lemma. By Lemma [\ref=groottes], a large (n - 1)-space through Π contains at least phk - h + 1 - phk - h - 1 - phk - h - 2 - 3phk - h - 3 points of B. Suppose there are y large (n - 1)-spaces through Π. Then the number of points in B is at least

[formula]

[formula]

which is at most phk0 + phk - 10 + phk - 20 + 3phk - 30. This yields y  ≤  4ph - 30.

Assume (H). Let B be a non-trivial small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7 and let P be a point of B, and let Π be a tangent (n - k)-space to B through P. Let H1 and H2 be two (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π for which [formula], for some h-space πi through a point x∈S(P), such that P lies on a (p0 + 1)-secant in Hi, i = 1,2. Then B(〈π1,π2〉)  ⊂  B.

Let L be a (p0 + 1)-secant through P in H1 and let [formula] be the line in π through x such that [formula]. Let s be a point of π2. By Lemma [\ref=handig] (ii), there is a small (n - 2)-space Πn - 2 through L, skew to B(s). There are at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 (p0 + 1)-secants through P, of which at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 - (ph - 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1) span an (n - 1)-space together with Πn - 2. By Lemma [\ref=handig] (iv), there are at most 4ph - 30 large spaces through Πn - 2, so at least ph - 10 - 4ph - 20 - (ph - 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1) - 4ph - 30 of the (p0 + 1)-secants through P have a transversal line [formula], for which [formula]. This gives in total at least ph + 10 - 6ph0 points Q in [formula] for which B(Q)  ⊂  B, denote this pointset by G. This means that every point t of [formula] lies on a line m with at least p0 - 5 points of G. Since 〈B(m)〉 either is contained in B, or it meets B in a linear set of rank at most h (see Lemma [\ref=handig] (iii)), and p0 - 5 > h, again by Theorem [\ref=subline], B(m)  ⊂  B by Theorem [\ref=subline], and hence, B(t)  ⊂  B.

Hence, for all (p0 + 1)-secants [formula], with [formula] through x, in H1, [formula]. This shows that there are at least (ph - 10 - 4ph - 20)ph + 10 + (ph + 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1) points Q in the 2h-space 〈π1,π2〉 such that B(Q)  ⊂  B. Every point t of 〈π1,π2〉 lies on a line m with at least p0 - 5 points of G. Again, since p0 - 5 > h, by Theorem [\ref=subline], B(m)  ⊂  B and hence, B(t)  ⊂  B. It follows that B(〈π1,π2〉)  ⊆  B.

Proof of Main Theorem 2. Let B be a non-trivial small minimal k-blocking set with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7. We will show that, assuming that all small minimal 1-blocking sets with exponent e in [formula], p prime, p0: = pe  ≥  7, are [formula]-linear, B is [formula]-linear. By induction, we may assume (H) holds. If B is a k-space, then B is [formula]-linear. If B is a non-trivial small minimal k-blocking set, Lemma [\ref=situatie] shows that there exists a point P of B, a tangent (n - k)-space Π at the point P and at least phk - h0 - 5phk - h - 10 (n - k + 1)-spaces Hi through Π for which [formula] is small and linear, where P lies on at least one (p0 + 1)-secant of [formula], [formula], s  ≥  phk - h0 - 5phk - h - 10. Let [formula], with πi an h-dimensional space in [formula], where x∈πi, with x∈S(P).

Lemma [\ref=ess] shows that B(〈πi,πj〉)  ⊆  B, 0  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  s.

If k = 2, the set B(〈π1,π2〉) corresponds to a linear 2-blocking set B' in [formula]. Since B is minimal, B = B', and the Theorem is proven.

Let k > 2. Denote the (n - k + 1)-spaces through Π, different from Hi, by [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=situatie] that z  ≤  5phk - h - 10 + (phk - h0 - 1) / (p0 - 1)  ≤  6phk - h - 10. There are at least (phk - h0 - 5phk - h - 10 - 1) / ph0 different (n - k + 2)-spaces 〈H1,Hj〉, 1 < j  ≤  s. If all (n - k + 2)-spaces 〈H1,Hj〉, contain at least 10ph - 10 of the spaces Ki, then z  ≥  10ph - 10(phk - h0 - 5phk - h - 10 - 1) / ph0 > 6phk - h - 10, a contradiction if p0  >  h + 10. Let 〈H1,H2〉 be an (n - k + 2)-spaces containing less than 10ph - 10 spaces Ki.

Suppose by induction that for any 1 < i < k, there is an (n - k + i)-space [formula] containing at most 10phi - h - 10 of the spaces Ki such that [formula].

There are at least

[formula]

different (n - k + i + 1)-spaces [formula], [formula]. If all of these contain at least 10phi - 10 of the spaces Ki, then z  ≥  6phk - h - 10, a contradiction. Let [formula] be an (n - k + i + 1)-space containing less than 10phi - 10 spaces Ki. We still need to prove that [formula]. Since B(〈πi + 1,π〉)  ⊆  B, with π an h-space in [formula] for which B(π) is not contained in one of the spaces Ki, there are at most 10phi - h - 10 2h-dimensional spaces 〈πi + 1,μ〉 for which B(〈πi + 1,μ〉) is not necessarily contained in B, giving rise to at most v: = 10phi - h - 10(p2h + 10 - 1) / (p0 - 1) points t for which B(t) is not necessarily contained in B. Let u be a point of such a space 〈πi + 1,μ〉, and suppose that B(u)∉B. If each of the (phi + h0 - 1) / (p0 - 1) lines through u in [formula] contains at least 10 of the points t for which B(t) is not in B, then there are more than v such points t, a contradiction. Hence, there is a line n through u for which for at least p0 - 10 points v∈n, B(v)∈B. Every line L meets B in a linear set (see Lemma [\ref=handig] (iii)), and if this linear set has rank at least h + 1, then L is completely contained in B. This implies that [formula] has rank at most h, and that the subline B(n) contains at least p0 - 10 points of the linear set [formula]. Since p0 - 10 > h, by Theorem [\ref=subline], B(n) is contained in [formula], so B(u)  ⊂  B, a contradiction.

This implies that [formula].

Since [formula], and [formula] corresponds to a linear k-blocking set B' in [formula] contained in the minimal k-blocking set B, B = B' and hence, B is [formula]-linear.
