Astrophysical neutrino results

Introduction

One of the main goals of neutrino telescopes is to find neutrinos associated with the sources of cosmic rays of ultra-high energy and thus to learn about how the sources accelerate particles to 1020 eV. Figure [\ref=fig1] is a compilation of measurements of the high energy cosmic-ray spectrum, which has three main features. The first is a knee between 1015 and 1016 eV where the spectrum steepens from 1.7 integral spectral index to 2.1. The second is an ankle between 1018 and 1019 eV above which the integral spectral index is 1.6. Finally, there is a steepening above 5  ×  1019 eV that is usually interpreted as being the result of energy losses in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) during propagation of particles over cosmic distances. The cutoff above 1020 eV could also just reflect the upper limiting energy of the cosmic accelerators.

The cosmic rays with energies above the ankle are generally agreed to be of extra-galactic origin. Somewhere at or below the ankle is the transition region where the fluxes of particles from galactic sources are comparable to those from extragalactic sources. Exactly where the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays occurs is an open question.

Two possibilities for extragalactic sources of cosmic rays are often discussed. One is the possibility that the sources are active galactic nuclei (AGN), which is much debated in connection with the Auger sky map of events of the highest energy [\cite=Augerskymap]. Another specific model involves acceleration in the jets of gamma-ray bursts (GRB). The model originally proposed in Ref. [\cite=WB-GRB] was extended in Ref. [\cite=Guetta] to provide a predicted neutrino spectrum for each burst based on measured features of its spectrum. Recent limits from IceCube place constraints on both models. The search with IceCube for neutrinos from identified GRBs was covered in the main IceCube talk at this conference [\cite=Greg]. This paper focuses on the search for an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from all directions that is expected to emerge above the steeper background spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos.

Limits from IceCube with muon neutrinos

The muon channel is the most favorable in terms of event rate in the TeV range and above because the target volume is enlarged by the charged current interactions of neutrinos outside the detector that produce muons that go through the detector. The most sensitive analysis uses the Earth as a shield against the downward background of cosmic-ray muons by selecting horizontal and upward moving events. For energies in the TeV range and above, stochastic energy losses by muons become important, and the light produced increases in proportion to the muon energy. Simulations that incorporate the physics of neutrino interactions, of muon energy loss and of ice properties are used to relate the measured light to the energy of the muon in the detector and thence to the energy of the neutrino. This is done either by convolving an assumed neutrino spectrum with the sequence νμ  →  μ  →   observed light, or by an unfolding procedure. An important feature of the analysis is that the distribution of νμ energies that give rise to a given signal in the detector is different for the steep atmospheric neutrino spectrum from what it would be for a hard spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos.

Upper limits on specific point sources of neutrinos in the Northern sky from IceCube are currently less than 10- 11 cm- 2s- 1TeV- 1. These results were obtained in 2008-2009 when IceCube was half complete and operating with 40 strings, each instrumented with 60 digital optical modules at depths between 1450 and 2450 m in the ice at the South Pole. The sensitivity to point sources is approaching the level of 10- 12 cm- 2s- 1TeV- 1 [\cite=ptsrc] at which TeV gamma rays are seen from some blazars (e.g. Mrk 401 [\cite=Daniel]).

It is important also to search for an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from the whole sky at high energy above the steeply falling background of atmospheric neutrinos. The Universe is transparent to neutrinos, so the flux of neutrinos from sources up to the Hubble radius could be large [\cite=Lipari]. Limits from AMANDA [\cite=AMANDA], Antares [\cite=Antares] and IceCube [\cite=IC40D] are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2]. The current limit from the 40-string version of IceCube is now below the original Waxman-Bahcall bound [\cite=WB].

This bound is an upper limit to the intensity of neutrinos which holds if the neutrinos are produced in the same sources that produce the extra-galactic cosmic rays. The bound may be saturated if neutrinos are produced from the accelerated particles that constitute the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR). Thus, as limits from IceCube push below the Waxman-Bahcall bound, models of this type come into question.

Atmospheric neutrino background (νμ  +  μ)

Searching for an extraterrestrial flux of neutrinos below the Waxman-Bahcall limit is difficult because it is comparable to the intensity of atmospheric neutrinos in an energy region where this fundamental background is not well known. The crossover between the current limit and the flux of atmospheric muon neutrinos is between 200 and 1000 TeV, depending on the level of neutrinos from decay of charmed hadrons (giving prompt neutrinos). The level of prompt neutrino production is highly uncertain, and the current IceCube limit appears already to rule out the highest prediction for charm [\cite=RQPM].

Moreover, the intensity of conventional neutrinos from decay of K± and π± is itself uncertain. Standard calculations of conventional atmospheric neutrinos [\cite=Bartol04] [\cite=Honda06] extend only to 10 TeV. The atmospheric neutrino flux used in the IceCube analysis [\cite=IC40D] is a simple power-law extrapolation of the calculation of Ref. [\cite=Honda06]. Its normalization is treated as a free parameter in fitting the data in Ref. [\cite=IC40D], which is shown as a slightly curved band that extends from 0.33 to 84 TeV in Fig. [\ref=fig2]. The other experimental results on the high-energy flux of atmospheric νμ  +  μ in Fig. [\ref=fig2] are from AMANDA [\cite=AMANDA1] [\cite=AMANDA2] and IceCube-40 [\cite=Warren]. All the atmospheric neutrino spectra shown here are averaged over angle. The unfolding analysis of Ref. [\cite=Warren] extends to Eν  ≈  400 TeV. The integral limit on astrophysical neutrinos shown for IceCube-40 in Fig. [\ref=fig2] assumes a hard, E- 2 spectrum. For this reason, the bound applies at much higher neutrino energies (35 TeV to 7 PeV) than the observed spectrum of atmospheric neutrinos.

Analyses of high-energy muon neutrinos with more recent versions of IceCube are underway (with 59 strings in 2009-2010 and with 79 strings in 2010-2011). The penultimate version with 79 strings ran until May 20, 2011 in a configuration that included the first 6 strings of a "Deep Core" subarray [\cite=Ty]. The full IceCube with 86 strings in the deep ice, including 8 Deep Core strings, and 81 IceTop stations on the surface has been running since then. The IceCube-59 analysis [\cite=Anne] will remove two simplifications made in previous analyses. One is to take account of the known zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric neutrino flux, which increases toward the horizon. This characteristic dependence, known as the "secant theta" effect, just reflects the increased probability of decay compared to interaction of the parent mesons for inclined trajectories in the upper atmosphere. In contrast, both the astrophysical neutrinos and prompt neutrinos (up to ~  10 PeV) are isotropic. Another improvement will involve taking account of the energy-dependence of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum that follows from the knee and other features of the primary cosmic-ray spectrum.

Another source of uncertainty in the flux of atmospheric νμ and μ at high energy arises from limited knowledge of kaon production in the forward fragmentation region of hadronic interactions in the atmospheric cascade [\cite=Agrawal]. Kaons are the dominant parent for neutrinos in the TeV energy range, and the process of associated production (p + air  molecule  →  Λ  +  K+  +  anything) is particularly important. The kaon contribution can be constrained, and its contribution to the uncertainty reduced, by interpreting the measurements of the muon charge ratio in the TeV energy range. The increase of μ+  /  μ- in the TeV range observed by MINOS [\cite=MINOScharge] and OPERA [\cite=OPERA] reflects the larger charge ratio of kaons coupled with their increasing (though not dominant) contribution to the muon flux in the TeV energy range.

Electron and tau neutrinos

Although the muon channel is expected to have the highest event rate for both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos, it is also important to look for electron and tau neutrinos. These flavors are characterized by the production of large, concentrated bursts of light ("cascades") in the detector [\cite=Joanna]. Neutrinos from distant sources have had time to oscillate and are expected to arrive at Earth in equal (or at least comparable) numbers in all flavors. The flux of atmospheric electron neutrinos is significantly lower than atmospheric muon neutrinos until prompt neutrinos dominate. In addition, the amount of light in the detector is directly related to the total νe energy for charged current interactions. For these reasons, the search for cascade-like events from interactions of electron neutrinos inside the detector is important.

Cascades at a level consistent with charged current interactions of atmospheric electron neutrinos and neutral current interactions of all flavors have been identified in the sub-TeV energy range in Deep Core [\cite=Chang-Hyon]. There are candidates for cascade events at higher energy in IceCube-22 [\cite=Joanna] and in IceCube-40 [\cite=Middell] [\cite=Hickford], but confirmation with IceCube-79 or with the full IceCube is needed to provide better containment for this promising channel.

Since atmospheric tau neutrinos are very rare, there is essentially no atmospheric background in this channel. Depending on the energy, tau neutrinos would show up in the detector as two unresolved cascades, as "double bang" events [\cite=LearnedPakvasa] or as a cascade associated with the track of a τ-lepton, either entering or leaving the instrumented volume [\cite=Reno].

The cascade channels in IceCube have already been effective in contributing to the limits at higher energy. For example, in the search for cosmogenic neutrinos with the 40-string version of IceCube [\cite=EHE], the contribution to the signal would be in the ratio νe:νμ:ντ    =    0.13:0.45:0.42 assuming equal presence of the three flavors at Earth. The energy flux of neutrinos from energy loss to photo-pion production by protons of ultra-high energy during propagation in the CMB typically peaks around 1018 to 1019 eV when plotted as EdNν  /  dln(E). For a specific model [\cite=Ahlers] the expected number of events was [formula] in the IceCube-40 data sample. No events passed the cuts, and an upper limit was set at ≤  3.6  ×  10- 8 GeV cm- 2s- 1sr- 1 for neutrinos of all flavors assuming an E- 2 differential spectrum. The limit covers an energy range from 2 PeV to 6 EeV, overlapping the energy ranges of cosmogenic neutrinos at high energy.
