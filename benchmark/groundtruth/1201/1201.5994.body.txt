On sets of vectors of a finite vector space in which every subset of basis size is a basis II

Introduction

Let S be a set of vectors of [formula] in which every subset of size k is a basis.

In 1952, Bush [\cite=Bush1952] showed that if k  ≥  q then |S|  ≤  k + 1 and the bound is attained if and only if S is equivalent to [formula], where [formula] is a basis.

The main conjecture for maximum distance separable codes (the MDS conjecture), proposed (as a question) by Segre [\cite=Segre1955b] in 1955 is the following.

A set S of vectors of the vector space [formula], with the property that every subset of S of size k  ≤  q is a basis, has size at most q + 1, unless q is even and k = 3 or k = q - 1, in which case it has size at most q + 2.

In this article we shall prove the conjecture for all k  ≤  2p - 2, where q = ph, p is prime and q is not prime.

We shall also prove the conjecture for q prime, which was first proven in [\cite=Ball2011]. It may help the reader to look at the first four sections of [\cite=Ball2011], although this article is self-contained (with the exception of the proof of Lemma [\ref=segre]) and can be read independently. The proof here is based on the ideas of [\cite=Ball2011] which themselves are based on the initial idea of Segre in [\cite=Segre1955a].

For a complete list of when the conjecture is known to hold for q non-prime, see [\cite=HS2001] and also [\cite=HT1991].

The best known bounds, up to first-order of magnitude (ci are constants), are that for q an odd non-square, the conjecture holds for [formula], Voloch [\cite=Voloch1991]. For q = p2h, where p  ≥  5 is a prime, the conjecture holds for [formula], Hirschfeld and Korchmáros [\cite=HK1996], and here we shall prove the conjecture for [formula] in the case q = p2. The conjecture is known to hold for all q  ≤  27 and for all k  ≤  5 and k = 6 with some exceptions.

Conjecture [\ref=MDSc] has implications for various problems in combinatorics, most notably for maximum distance separable codes (whence the name) from coding theory and the uniform matroid from matroid theory.

A linear maximum distance separable code is a linear code of length n, dimension k and minimum distance d over [formula], for which d = n - k + 1. Conjecture [\ref=MDSc] implies that a linear maximum distance separable code has length n at most q + 1 unless q is even and k = 3 or k = q - 1, in which case it has length at most q + 2. For more details on codes and MDS codes in particular, see [\cite=MS1977].

A matroid M = (E,F) is a pair in which E is a set and F is a set of subsets of E, called independent sets, such that (1) every subset of an independent set is an independent subset; and (2) for all A  ⊆  E, all maximal independent subsets of A have the same cardinality, called the rank of A and denoted r(A). The maximal independent sets of the uniform matroid of rank r are all the r element subsets of the set E. Conjecture [\ref=MDSc] implies that the uniform matroid of rank r, with |E|  ≥  r + 2, is representable over [formula] if and only if |E|  ≤  q + 1, unless q is even and r = 3 or r = q - 1, in which case it is if and only if |E|  ≤  q + 2. For more details on matroids and representations of matroids in particular, see [\cite=Oxley1992].

The tangent function and the Segre product

For any subset Y of k - 2 elements of S, since there are at most k - 1 vectors of S in a hyperplane, there are exactly

[formula]

hyperplanes containing Y and no other vector of S.

We shall assume throughout that t  ≥  1, which is no restriction since we are trying to prove |S|  ≤  q + 1 for k  ≥  4.

Let φY be a set of t linearly independent linear maps from [formula] to [formula] with the property that for each α∈φY, Ker(α) is one of the t hyperplanes containing Y and no other vector of S.

The tangent function at Y is defined (up to scalar factor) as

[formula]

and is a map from [formula] to [formula].

The following is a coordinate-free version of Segre's lemma of tangents [\cite=Segre1967] and is from [\cite=Ball2011].

Let D be a set of k - 3 elements of S. For all [formula]

[formula]

Since we wish to write det (A) where [formula] is a subset of S, to mean the determinant [formula], we order the elements of S from now on. We write [formula] to mean the determinant in which the elements of A1 come first, then the elements of A2, etc.

The following, which follows from interpolating the tangent function, is also from [\cite=Ball2011].

If |S|  ≥  k + t > k then for any Y of size k - 2 and E of size t + 2, disjoint subsets of S,

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be two subsequences of S of the same length n and let D be a subset of [formula] of size k - n - 1.

We define the Segre product of A and B with base D to be

[formula]

and [formula].

The following lemmas are a consequence of Lemma [\ref=segre].

[formula]

where the sequence A* is obtained from A by interchanging two elements.

It is enough to prove the lemma for two adjacent elements in A since the transposition [formula] can be written as the product of [formula] transpositions of the form (n n + 1).

The only terms in the Segre product which differ when we interchange aj and aj + 1 are the terms in the product for i = j and i = j + 1. Trivially

[formula]

is equal to

[formula]

where [formula], which is equal to

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=segre].

In the same way the following lemma also holds.

[formula]

where the sequence B* is obtained from B by interchanging two elements.

The following lemma will also be needed.

If A and B are subsequences of S and |A| = |B| - 1 then

[formula]

Using the definition of the Segre product and Lemma [\ref=segre],

[formula]

[formula]

The main lemma

For any subset B of an ordered set L, let σ(B,L) be (t + 1) times the number of transpositions needed to order L so that the elements of B are the last |B| elements.

Let A of size n, L of size r, D of size k - 1 - r and Ω of size t + 1 - n be pairwise disjoint subsequences of S. If n  ≤  r  ≤  n + p - 1 and r  ≤  t + 2, where q = ph, then

[formula]

[formula]

By induction on r. The case r = n is straightforward.

Fix an x∈L and apply the inductive step to [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

[formula]

Let Δ be a subset of Ω of size r - n - 1. The set [formula] has size t + 1 - n - (r - n - 1) = t + 2 - r and so since r  ≤  t + 2 we can apply Lemma [\ref=interpolation], with [formula] and [formula], and get

[formula]

[formula]

Multiply this equation by [formula] for some d for which [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=denominator] we can rearrange L so that the last element is x, which changes the sign by σ(x,L). This gives

[formula]

[formula]

since

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=switch] (and Lemma [\ref=numerator])

[formula]

Note that in the second term we can order [formula] in any way we please without changing the sign since, by Lemma [\ref=numerator], interchanging two elements of [formula] in [formula] changes the sign by ( - 1)t + 1, exactly the same change occurs when we interchange the same vectors in the product of determinants.

Therefore, when we sum this equation over subsets Δ of Ω of size r - n - 1 and apply the induction hypothesis, we get

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since

[formula]

this equation gives

[formula]

[formula]

which is what we wanted to prove.

If k  ≤  p then |S|  ≤  q + 1.

If |S| = q + 2 then t = k - 3. If q is prime then, by [\cite=Ball2011], we may dualise in [formula], if necessary, to assume that k  ≤  (q + 1) / 2 and so k + t  ≤  q + 2.

Since k + t  ≤  q + 2 we can apply Lemma [\ref=basic] with r = t + 2 = k - 1 and n = 0 and get

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

The case |S| = q + 2 and q is non-prime.

For any subsequence [formula] of S and [formula], define the subsequence Xτ  =  {xi | i∈τ}.

Suppose that |S| = q + 2 and n  ≥  k - p. Let A of size n - m, L of size k - 1 - m, Ω of size k - 2 - n, X of size m, Y of size m be disjoint subsequences of S. Then

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula].

By induction on m. For m = 0 this is Lemma [\ref=basic] with r = t + 2 = k - 1, which gives the bound n  ≥  k - p.

Suppose that X and Y have size m and that x,y∈S are not contained in X, Y, L or A. We wish to prove the equation for [formula], [formula], L and A, where |L| = k - 2 - m and |A| = n - m - 1.

Apply the inductive step to [formula], [formula], X and Y.

Writing the first sum as two sums depending on whether B contains y or not, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=numerator], then Lemma [\ref=switch] and then Lemma [\ref=numerator] again, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=numerator] and the definition of the Segre product

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, multiplying the equation before by [formula] and noting that

[formula]

we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Applying the inductive step to [formula], [formula], X and Y and writing the sum as two sums depending on whether B contains x or not, gives an equation similar to the above. The first sum in both equations vary only in the position of x and y in the determinants. Switching these in the above, multiplying by ( - 1)t + 1, and equating the two second sums gives,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Note that on the right-hand side of the equality we use

[formula]

Rearranging the order of the vectors in the Segre product of the right-hand side (applying Lemma [\ref=numerator] and Lemma [\ref=denominator]) and the vectors in the determinants gives

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Finally, note that

[formula]

and that

[formula]

from which we deduce that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], which is what we wanted to prove.

The main theorem

The following follows from Laplace's formula for determinants.

Suppose that [formula] is a basis of [formula] and |X| = n and [formula]. Then

[formula]

If q is non-prime and k  ≤  2p - 2 then |S|  ≤  q + 1.

By Theorem [\ref=prime], we can restrict ourselves to the cases k  ≥  p + 1.

Suppose |S| = q + 2 and apply Lemma [\ref=twotothen] with n = m = k - p. Then

[formula]

where |L| = p - 1, Ω = p - 2 and |M| = k - p.

Let [formula] be a subsequence of S disjoint from [formula], where E is a subset of Ω of size p - 2 - n = 2p - k - 2. Define [formula].

We shall prove the following by induction on r  ≤  n,

[formula]

[formula]

For r = 0 this is the above with [formula]. Applying the inductive step with [formula], where [formula], we have

[formula]

[formula]

Multiplying by [formula], summing over [formula] and applying Lemma [\ref=laplace] proves the induction.

For r = n every term in the sum is zero apart from the term corresponding to [formula], which gives

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

If q is non-prime and q - 2p + 4  ≤  k  ≤  q then |S|  ≤  q + 1.

Suppose that |S| = q + 2. Then by [\cite=Ball2011] we can construct a set of vectors S' of [formula] of size q + 2 with the property that every subset of S' of size q + 2 - k is a basis of [formula].

Appendix

Using the Segre product and the lemmas from Section [\ref=lemmas] we can give a short proof of [\cite=Ball2011], the main tool used to prove that |S|  ≤  q + 1 and classify the case |S| = q + 1, for k  ≤  p, in [\cite=Ball2011].

Let L of size r, D of size k - 1 - r and Ω of size t + 2 be pairwise disjoint subsequences of S. If 1  ≤  r  ≤  t + 2 and r  ≤  p - 1, where q = ph, then

[formula]

where [formula] is the first element of L.

By induction on r. The case r = 1 follows by dividing the equation in Lemma [\ref=interpolation], with E = Ω and Y = D, by [formula].

Fix x∈L and apply the induction step to [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

Let Δ be a subset of Ω of size r - 1. Applying Lemma [\ref=interpolation] with [formula] and [formula], we get

[formula]

[formula]

Multiplying by [formula] for some d for which [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=denominator] we can rearrange L so that the last element is x, which changes the sign by σ(x,L). This gives

[formula]

[formula]

since

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=switch] (and Lemma [\ref=numerator])

[formula]

Note that in the second term we can order [formula] in any way we please without changing the sign since, by Lemma [\ref=numerator], interchanging two elements of [formula] in [formula] changes the sign by ( - 1)t + 1, exactly the same change occurs when we interchange the same vectors in the product of determinants.

Therefore, when we sum this equation over subsets Δ of Ω of size r - 1 and apply the induction hypothesis, the first sum is zero and the second sum gives
