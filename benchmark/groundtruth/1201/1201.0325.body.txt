Quasi-representations of Finsler modules over C*-algebras

INTRODUCTION

The notation of Finsler module is an interesting generalization of that of Hilbert C*-module. It is a useful tool in the operator theory and the theory of operator algebras and may be served as a noncommutative version of the concept of Banach bundle, which is an essential concept in the Finsler geometry. In 1995 Phillips and Weaver [\cite=ph] showed that if a C*-algebra [formula] has no nonzero commutative ideal, then any Finsler [formula]-module must be a Hilbert C*-module. If [formula] is the commutative C*-algebra C0(X) of all continuous complex-valued functions vanishing at infinity on a locally compact Hausdorff space X, then any Finsler [formula]-module is isomorphic to the module of continuous sections of a bundle of Banach spaces over X. The concept of a φ-morphism between Finsler modules was introduced in [\cite=M].

The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) representation theorem is one of the most useful theorems, which is applied in operator algebras and mathematical physics. That provides a procedure to construct representations of C*-algebras. A generalization of GNS construction to a topological *  -algebra established by Borchers, Uhlmann and Powers leading to unbounded *  -representations of *  -algebras; see [\cite=po]. Another is a generalization of a positive linear functional to a completely positive map studied by Stinespring [\cite=st], see also [\cite=JOI1].

Let [formula] be a C*-algebra and let [formula] denote the positive cone of all positive elements of [formula]. We define a Finsler [formula]-module to be a right [formula]-module [formula] equipped with a map [formula] (denoted by [formula] if there is an ambiguity) satisfying the following conditions: (i) The map [formula] makes [formula] into a Banach space. (ii) ρ(xa)2 = a*ρ(x)2a, for all [formula] and [formula]

A Finsler module [formula] over a C*-algebra [formula] is said to be full if the linear span of [formula] is dense in [formula]. For example, if [formula] is a (full) Hilbert C*-module over [formula] (see [\cite=MT]), then [formula] together with [formula] is a (full) Finsler module over [formula], since

[formula]

In particular, every C*-algebra [formula] is a full Finsler module over [formula] under the mapping [formula].

Our goal is to extend the notion of a representation of a Hilbert C*-module to the framework of Finsler [formula]-modules. We show that every Finsler [formula]-module has a quasi-representation into the Banach space [formula] of all bounded linear operators between some Hilbert spaces [formula] and [formula]. We define the notion of completely positive φ-morphism and establish a Stinespring type theorem in the framework of Finsler modules over C*-algebras. We also introduce the notions of the nondegeneracy and the irreducibility of quasi-representations and study some interrelations between them.

QUASI-REPRESENTATIONS OF FINSLER MODULES

We start our work by giving the definition of a φ-morphism of a Finsler module.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are Finsler modules over C*-algebras [formula] and [formula], respectively and [formula] is a *  -homomorphism of C*-algebras. A (not necessarily linear) map [formula] is said to be a φ-morphism of Finsler modules if the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) [formula];

(ii) Φ(xa) = Φ(x)φ(a). for all [formula] and [formula]. In the case of Hilbert C*-modules, Φ is assumed to be linear and then condition (ii) is deduced from (i).

Now we introduce the notion of a quasi-representation of a Finsler module. Due to [formula] is a Hilbert C*-module over [formula] via 〈T,S〉 = T*S, we can endow [formula] a Finsler structure by

[formula]

Let [formula] be a Finsler module over a C*-algebra [formula]. A map [formula], where [formula] is a representation of [formula] is called a quasi-representation of [formula] if ρ0(Φ(x)) = φ(ρ(x)) for all [formula].

We are going to show that for every Finsler [formula]-module there is a quasi-representation to [formula] for some Hilbert spaces [formula] and [formula], see also [\cite=mor].

Suppose [formula] is a Finsler [formula]-module with the associated map [formula]. Then there is a quasi-representation [formula] for some Hilbert spaces [formula] and [formula].

By the Gelfand-Naimark theorem for C*-algebras, there is a representation [formula] for some Hilbert space [formula]. We want to construct a Hilbert space [formula]. Put

[formula]

and define on [formula] an inner product by

[formula]

Note that if [formula], then

[formula]

Thus [formula] for each [formula], whence [formula]. Let us consider the closure [formula] of [formula] to get a Hilbert space, which is denoted by [formula] For any [formula] and [formula], the map [formula] defined by

[formula]

has a finite support. For [formula], define [formula] by Φ(x)h = φ(ρ(x))hx. We show that [formula]. Clearly Φ(x) is linear. Also Φ(x) is bounded, since

[formula]

whence [formula]. Further,

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula]. Hence Φ(x)*Φ(x) = φ(ρ(x)2). Hence

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=10]) and equality ([\ref=4]) that ρ0(Φ(x)) = φ(ρ(x)).

If Φ is surjective and [formula] is a full Finsler [formula]-module, then by [\cite=M], φ is surjective.

In the next section the notion of completely positive φ-morphism is introduced and a construction of Stinespring's theorem for Finsler modules is given.

A STINESPRING TYPE THEOREM FOR FINSLER MODULES

The Stinespring theorem was first introduced in the work of Stinespring in 1995 that described the structure of completely positive maps of a C*-algebra into the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space; see [\cite=st]. Recently Asadi [\cite=As] proved this theorem for Hilbert C*-modules. Further, Bhat et al. [\cite=Bha] improve the result of [\cite=As] with omitting a technical condition. In this section we intend to establish a Stinespring type theorem in the framework of Finsler modules over C*-algebras.

A φ-morphism [formula] is called completely positive if the map [formula] is completely positive.

Let [formula] be a Finsler module over a unital C*-algebra [formula], let [formula] be Hilbert spaces and let [formula] be a completely positive map associated to a completely positive map [formula]. Then there exist Hilbert spaces [formula] and isometries [formula], a *  -homomorphism [formula] and a θ-morphism [formula] such that φ(a) = V*θ(a)V,Φ(x) = W*Ψ(x)V for all [formula] and [formula].

By [\cite=paul] there exist a Hilbert space [formula], a representation [formula] and an isometry [formula] defined by [formula] such that φ(a) = V*θ(a)V. We may consider a minimal Stinespring representation for θ, where [formula] is the closed linear span of [formula]. Now, we put [formula] to be the closed linear span of [formula] and define the mapping [formula], where [formula] is defined by [formula] for [formula] The map Ψ(x) is well-defined and bounded, since

[formula]

The mapping Ψ is a θ-morphism, since for all [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

whence Ψ(x)*Ψ(x) = θ(ρ(x)2). Moreover

[formula]

so that Ψ(x)θ(a) = Ψ(xa). Since [formula] we can consider a map W as the orthogonal projection of [formula] onto [formula]. Hence [formula] is the inclusion map, whence for any [formula] we have WW*(k') = W(k') = k', that is [formula]. Finally we observe that W*Ψ(x)Vh = Ψ(x)Vh = Ψ(x)(θ(1)Vh) = Φ(x)h, that is W*Ψ(x)V = Φ(x).

NONDEGENERATE AND IRREDUCIBLE QUASI-REPRESENTATIONS

In this section we define the notions of nondegenerate and irreducible quasi-representations of Finsler modules and describe relations between the nondegeneracy and the irreduciblity, see [\cite=lji]. Throughout this section we assume that the quasi-representations satisfy condition (ii) of Definition 2.1.

Let [formula] be a quasi-representation of a Finsler module [formula] over a C*-algebra [formula]. The map Φ is said to be nondegenerate if [formula] and [formula] (or equivalently, if there exist [formula] such that [formula] and [formula], then ξ  =  η = 0). Recall that a representation [formula] of a C*-algebra [formula] is nondegenerate if [formula] (or equivalently, if there exists [formula] such that [formula], then ξ = 0), see [\cite=ske].

If [formula] is a nondegenerate quasi-representation, then [formula] is a nondegenerate representation. If [formula] is full and φ is nondegenerate, then Φ is also nondegenerate.

Suppose that Φ is nondegenerate and [formula]. It follows from the Hewitt-Cohen factorization theorem that [formula]. We conclude that ξ = 0. Thus φ is nondegenerate.

Suppose that [formula] for some [formula]. Then for any [formula] we have [formula]. Since [formula] is a full Finsler [formula]-module, [formula] for some [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Hence

[formula]

whence ξ = 0.

The second result of Theorem [\ref=5] may fail, if the condition of being full is dropped. To see this take [formula] to be a nondegenerate von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space, which has a nontrivial central projection P. Hence the identity map [formula] is assumed to be nondegenerate. Put [formula] as a Finsler [formula]-module equipped with ρ(aP) = |aP|. Clearly [formula] is not full. The identity map [formula] satisfies the following:

(i) ρ0Φ(aP) = ρ0(aP) = |aP|  =  φ(|aP|) = φρ(aP), where ρ0 is defined as in ([\ref=10]).

(ii) Φ(aPb) = Φ(aP)φ(b) for all [formula]. Hence Φ is a quasi-representation of [formula], which is not clearly nondegenerate, since

[formula]

In the following corollary we investigate a condition under which the representation φ and the quasi-representation Φ are nondegenerate.

If [formula], then both Φ and φ are nondegenerate.

Suppose [formula] for some [formula]. Then for all [formula] we have [formula], so that ξ = 0. The nondegeneracy of φ follows from Theorem [\ref=5].

Let [formula] be a quasi-representation of a Finsler module [formula] over a C*-algebra [formula] and let [formula] be closed subspaces of [formula] and [formula], respectively. A pair of subspaces [formula] is said to be Φ-invariant if [formula] and [formula]. The quasi-representation Φ is said to be irreducible if (0,0) and [formula] are the only Φ-invariant pairs. Recall that a representation [formula] of a C*-algebra [formula] is irreducible if 0 and [formula] are only closed subspaces of [formula] being φ-invariant, i.e. are invariant for [formula].

Suppose that the quasi-representation [formula] constructed in Theorem [\ref=main] is irreducible. Then so is [formula]. If [formula] is full and φ is irreducible, then Φ is irreducible.

Suppose that Φ is irreducible and a closed subspace [formula] of [formula] is φ-invariant. Consider [formula]. Clearly [formula]. Due to [formula] we observe that [formula], whence [formula] for all [formula]. Now let x  ≠  y. In the notation of Theorem [\ref=main] we have

[formula]

for all [formula]. Put h' = Φ(x)*Φ(y)h to get 〈Φ(x)*Φ(y)h,Φ(x)*Φ(y)h〉 = 0. So that Φ(x)*Φ(y)h = 0. Therefore [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Since Φ is irreducible, we conclude that [formula] or [formula], hence [formula] or [formula]. This implies that φ is irreducible.

Now assume that φ is irreducible. It follows from [\cite=mo] that φ is nondegenerate. By Theorem [\ref=5], Φ is nondegenerate. Consider [formula] as a Φ-invariant pair of subspaces. Any [formula] can be represented as [formula] for some [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Hence [formula] or [formula]. If [formula] then [formula], and for every [formula] we have 0 = 〈Φ(x)*ξ',ξ〉  =  〈ξ',Φ(x)ξ〉 for [formula] and [formula], so that [formula]. Since [formula], we have [formula]. If [formula], then [formula]. Hence [formula]. Therefore Φ is irreducible.

The result may fail, if the condition of being full is dropped. The closed subspace [formula] in Remark [\ref=7] when [formula] is irreducible provides a counterexample.

Next we present some conditions under which the quasi-representation Φ is nondegenerate and irreducible.

Let [formula] be a full Finsler [formula]-module and let [formula] is irreducible. Then the quasi-representation [formula] is nondegenerate and irreducible.

Since φ is irreducible, it is nondegenerate. Since [formula] is full, by Theorem [\ref=5], Φ is nondegenerate and by Theorem [\ref=6], Φ is irreducible.

Let [formula] be a full Finsler [formula]-module. Then [formula] is a subset of the space [formula] of all compact operators from [formula] into [formula] if and only if [formula].

Suppose [formula]. Applying the Hewitt-Cohen factorization theorem we have [formula]. Conversely, suppose that [formula]. Since [formula] is full we have

[formula]

where [formula] for some [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Now in the next two examples we illustrate the considered situations in the notation of Theorem 2.3.

By [\cite=d] the identity map [formula] is irreducible. It is known that the C*-algebra [formula] is a full Finsler module over [formula] with ρ(T) = |T|. Hence the quasi-representation [formula] is nondegenerate and irreducible.

Consider [formula]. Then [formula]. Hence φ is irreducible. Also [formula] is a full Finsler [formula]-module, so that the quasi-representation [formula] is nondegenerate and irreducible.
