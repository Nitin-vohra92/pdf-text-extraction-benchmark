The Nevanlinna-type formula for the matrix Hamburger moment problem in a general case.

S.M. Zagorodnyuk

Introduction.

Recall that the matrix Hamburger moment problem consists of finding a left-continuous non-decreasing matrix function M(x)  =  (mk,l(x))N - 1k,l = 0 on [formula], M( -   ∞  ) = 0, such that

[formula]

where {Sn}∞n = 0 is a prescribed sequence of Hermitian (N  ×  N) complex matrices (moments), [formula]. The moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is said to be determinate if it has a unique solution and indeterminate in the opposite case.

This problem was introduced in 1949 by Krein [\cite=cit_100_K], and he described all solutions in the case when the corresponding J-matrix defines a symmetric operator with maximal defect numbers. This result appeared without proof in [\cite=cit_200_K] (Berezansky in 1965 proved the main fact in this theory of Krein: the convergence of the series from the polynomials of the first kind, even for the operator moment problem [\cite=cit_700_Ber]). Under similar conditions, some descriptions of solutions were obtained by Kovalishina [\cite=cit_300_K], by Lopez-Rodriguez [\cite=cit_400_L] and by Dyukarev [\cite=cit_500_D].

In the scalar case, a description of all solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) can be found, e.g., in [\cite=cit_600_Akh],[\cite=cit_700_Ber] for the nondegenerate case, and in [\cite=cit_800_AK] for the degenerate case.

Set

[formula]

It is well known that the following condition

[formula]

is necessary and sufficient for the solvability of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]).

For a recent discussion on the truncated matrix Hamburger moment problems we refer to the paper [\cite=cit_820_DFKMT] and references therein. It is worth mentioning that for the truncated moment problems much is done for the degenerate case, as well. The case of the full moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is not such investigated. In [\cite=cit_850_Z] we presented an analytic description of all solutions of the matrix Hamburger moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) under condition ([\ref=f1_4]). The main aim of our present investigation is to obtain a Nevanlinna-type formula for the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) in a general case. We only assume that condition ([\ref=f1_4]) holds and the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is indeterminate (but not necessarily completely indeterminate). We express the matrix coefficients of the corresponding linear fractional transformation in terms of the given moments. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for the determinacy of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) in terms of the prescribed moments are given.

Notations. As usual, we denote by [formula] the sets of real numbers, complex numbers, positive integers, integers, non-negative integers, respectively; [formula], [formula], [formula]. The notation [formula] means that [formula], k  ≤  ρ, if ρ  <    ∞  ; or [formula], if ρ  =    ∞  . The set of all complex matrices of size (m  ×  n) we denote by [formula], [formula]. If [formula] then MT denotes the transpose of M, and M* denotes the complex conjugate of M. The identity matrix from [formula] we denote by In, [formula]; I∞  =  (δk,l)∞k,l = 0, δk,l is Kronecker's delta. If a set S has a finite number of elements, then its number of elements we denote by [formula]. If a set S has an infinite number of elements, then [formula].

For a separable Hilbert space H we denote by (  ·  ,  ·  )H and [formula] the scalar product and the norm in H, respectively. The indices may be omitted in obvious cases.

For a linear operator A in H we denote by D(A) its domain, by R(A) its range, and by A* we denote its adjoint if it exists. If A is invertible, then A- 1 means its inverse. If A is closable, then [formula] means its closure. If A is bounded, then [formula] stands for its operator norm. For a set of elements {xn}n∈K in H, we denote by [formula] and [formula] the linear span and the closed linear span in the norm of H, respectively. Here K is an arbitrary set of indices. For a set M  ⊆  H, we denote by [formula] the closure of M in the norm of H. By EH we denote the identity operator in H, i.e. EHx  =  x, x∈H. Let H1 be a subspace of H. By PH1  =  PHH1 we denote the operator of the orthogonal projection on H1 in H.

If A is symmetric, we set Rz  =  Rz(A)  =  (A - zEH)- 1, [formula]. If V is isometric, we set Rζ  =  Rζ(V)  =  (EH  -  ζV)- 1, [formula].

The matrix Hamburger moment problem: the determinacy and a Nevanlinna-type formula.

Let the matrix Hamburger moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) be given and condition ([\ref=f1_4]) hold. Set

[formula]

The matrix Γ is a semi-infinite block matrix. It may be viewed as a usual semi-infinite matrix, as well. Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

We need here some constructions from [\cite=cit_850_Z]. By Theorem 1 in [\cite=cit_850_Z] (and this construction is well known), there exist a Hilbert space H, and a sequence {xn}∞n = 0 in H, such that [formula], and

[formula]

We choose an arbitrary such a space H and a sequence {xn}∞n = 0 in H, and fix them in the rest of the paper.

Set [formula], and consider the following operator with the domain L:

[formula]

This operator is correctly defined and symmetric.

Let Â be an arbitrary self-adjoint extension of A in a Hilbert space Ĥ  ⊇  H. Let Rz(Â)  =  (Â  -  zEĤ)- 1 be the resolvent of Â and [formula] be the orthogonal left-continuous resolution of unity of Â. Recall that the operator-valued function [formula] is called a generalized resolvent of A, [formula]. The function [formula], [formula], is a spectral function of a symmetric operator A. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between generalized resolvents and spectral functions. It is given by the following relation ([\cite=cit_2000_AG]):

[formula]

By Theorem 2 in [\cite=cit_850_Z], all solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) have the following form:

[formula]

where [formula] is a spectral function of the operator A. Moreover, the correspondence between all spectral functions of A and all solutions of the moment problem is bijective.

By ([\ref=f2_14]) and ([\ref=f2_30]) we conclude that the formula

[formula]

establishes a one-to-one correspondence between all generalized resolvents of A and all solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]).

Let B be a closed symmetric operator in the Hilbert space H, with the domain D(B), [formula]. Set ΔB(λ)  =  (B - λEH)D(B), and [formula], [formula]. Consider an arbitrary bounded linear operator C, which maps Ni into N- i. For

[formula]

we set

[formula]

The operator BC is said to be a quasiself-adjoint extension of the operator B, defined by the operator C. By Theorem 4 in [\cite=cit_850_Z], the following relation:

[formula]

establishes a bijective correspondence between all solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) and all analytic in [formula] operator-valued functions F(λ), which values are contractions which map [formula] into [formula]. Here AF(λ) is the quasiself-adjoint extension of [formula] defined by F(λ).

[formula]

Let us apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to the sequence {y-k}∞k = 0, removing the linear dependent elements if they appear. We shall get a sequence [formula], 0  ≤  τ-  ≤    +    ∞  . The case τ-  =  0 means that y-k  =  0, [formula], and [formula] is an empty set.

In a similar manner, we apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to the sequence {y+k}∞k = 0, and obtain a sequence [formula], 0  ≤  τ+  ≤    +    ∞  . The case τ+  =  0 means that y+k  =  0, [formula], and [formula].

If not empty, the set [formula] forms an orthonormal basis in H±, respectively. Notice that, by the construction, each element u±k, [formula], is a linear combination of y±j, 0  ≤  j  ≤  k, respectively. Let

[formula]

Observe that by ([\ref=f2_9]) we may write

[formula]

[formula]

By representation ([\ref=f2_45_1]), the condition τ-  =  0 (τ+  =  0) is equivalent to the condition D(A)  =  {0}, and therefore to the condition H = {0}. By ([\ref=f2_7]),([\ref=f2_9]), the condition H = {0} is equivalent to the condition Sn  =  0, [formula].

We emphasize that the numbers ξk;j in ([\ref=f2_45_2]) can be computed explicitly by using relations ([\ref=f2_7]),([\ref=f2_9]). Moreover, the processes of orthogonalization which appear in this paper are based on the use of relations ([\ref=f2_7]),([\ref=f2_9]). In fact, any norm or any scalar product which appear during orthogonalization is expressed in terms of the prescribed moments.

Let the matrix Hamburger moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) be given and condition ([\ref=f1_4]), with Γn from ([\ref=f1_3]), be satisfied. Let the operator A in the Hilbert space H be constructed as in ([\ref=f2_11]). The following conditions are equivalent:

The moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is determinate;

One of the defect numbers of A is equal to zero (or the both of them are zero);

Sr  =  0, [formula], or, [formula], [formula], and one of the following conditions holds (or the both of them hold):

For each n, 0  ≤  n  ≤  N - 1, the following equality holds:

[formula]

For each n, 0  ≤  n  ≤  N - 1, the following equality holds:

[formula]

Here Γ·  ,  · are from ([\ref=f2_6_1]), and ξ±·  ,  · are from ([\ref=f2_45_2]).

If the above conditions are satisfied then the unique solution of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is given by the following relation:

[formula]

where Et is the left-continuous orthogonal resolution of unity of the self-adjoint operator A.

Proof. (A)⇒  (B). If the both defect numbers are greater then zero, then we can choose unit vectors [formula] and [formula]. We set

[formula]

On the other hand, we set [formula]. Functions F(λ) and [formula] produce different solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) by relation ([\ref=f2_45]).

(B)⇒  (A). If one of the defect numbers is zero, then the only admissible function F(λ) in relation ([\ref=f2_45]) is [formula].

(B)⇒  (C). If H = {0} then condition (C) holds. Let [formula].

Notice that by ([\ref=f2_9]) and ([\ref=f2_45_3]), condition (C),(a) may be written as

[formula]

while condition (C),(b) is equivalent to

[formula]

Therefore condition (C),(a) is equivalent to relations:

[formula]

and condition (C),(b) is equivalent to condition:

[formula]

By the formula (37) in [\cite=cit_850_Z], each element of L belongs to the linear span of elements {xn}∞n = 0, {y-k}∞k = 0, as well as to the linear span of elements {xn}∞n = 0, {y+k}∞k = 0. Consequently, condition ([\ref=f2_45_7]) is equivalent to the condition

[formula]

and condition ([\ref=f2_45_8]) is equivalent to the condition

[formula]

Since one of the defect numbers is equal to zero then either ([\ref=f2_45_9]), or ([\ref=f2_45_10]) holds.

(C)⇒  (B). If H = {0} then condition (B) holds. Let [formula]. If condition (C),(a) (condition (C),(b)) holds, then by the above considerations before ([\ref=f2_45_9]) we obtain H = H- (respectively H = H+). Therefore one of the defect numbers of A is equal to zero.

The last assertion of the theorem follows from formula ([\ref=f2_30]). [formula]

We shall continue our considerations started before the statement of Theorem [\ref=t2_1]. In what follows we assume that the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is indeterminate. Let the defect numbers of A are equal to [formula], and [formula], δ,ω  ≥  1.

For simplicity of notations we set τ: = τ-, and

[formula]

Let us apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to the vectors

[formula]

Notice that the elements {uk}τ - 1k = 0 are already orthonormal. Then we get an orthonormal set in H:

[formula]

Notice that [formula] is an orthonormal basis in [formula].

Set

[formula]

The operator V is a closed isometric operator with the domain H- and the range H+. Set

[formula]

Observe that by ([\ref=f2_45_2]) we may write

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

is an orthonormal basis in H+.

Let us apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to the vectors

[formula]

The elements {vk}τ - 1k = 0 are already orthonormal. Then we get another orthonormal basis in H:

[formula]

Observe that [formula] is an orthonormal basis in [formula].

Let [formula] be an arbitrary generalized resolvent of the operator A. Let us check that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In fact, let [formula] be a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space [formula], such that [formula], [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

By substitution ([\ref=f2_45_14]) into ([\ref=f2_45_13]), we get ([\ref=f2_45_12]).

Let Û  ⊇  V be an arbitrary unitary extension of V in a Hilbert space Ĥ  ⊇  H. Recall [\cite=cit_2100_Ch] that the following function:

[formula]

is said to be a generalized resolvent of V.

Observe that the generalized resolvents of V and [formula] are connected by the following relation [\cite=cit_2200_Ch]:

[formula]

(The latter relation follows from the fact that the usual resolvents of V and [formula] are related by a similar relation, and then one applies the projection operator PĤH to the both sides of that relation.) Correspondence ([\ref=f2_45_16]) between all generalized resolvents of V and all generalized resolvents of [formula] is bijective. Then

[formula]

By ([\ref=f2_45_17]),([\ref=f2_45_12]) and ([\ref=f2_9]) we get

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Observe that an arbitrary generalized resolvent [formula] of the closed isometric operator [formula] has the following representation [\cite=cit_2100_Ch]:

[formula]

Here Φζ is an analytic in [formula] operator-valued function which values are linear contractions from [formula] into [formula]. The correspondence between all such functions Φζ and all generalized resolvents of V is bijective.

By ([\ref=f2_45_18]),([\ref=f2_45_20]) we get

[formula]

[formula]

where Φ· is an analytic in [formula] operator-valued function which values are linear contractions from [formula] into [formula].

By ([\ref=f2_30_1]) and ([\ref=f2_45_21]) we conclude that the formula

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

establishes a one-to-one correspondence between all analytic in [formula] operator-valued functions Φ·, which values are linear contractions from [formula] into [formula], and all solutions M(λ) = (mk,j(λ))N - 1k,j = 0 of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]).

It turns out that formula ([\ref=f2_45_22]) is more convenient then formula ([\ref=f2_45]), in order to obtain a Nevanlinna-type formula for the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]).

Denote by M1,ζ(Φ) the matrix of the operator [formula] in the basis [formula], [formula]. Here Φζ is an analytic in [formula] operator-valued function, which values are linear contractions from [formula] into [formula]. Then

Notice that matrices A0,ζ,C0,ζ, [formula], can be calculated explicitly using relations ([\ref=f2_9]) and ([\ref=f2_7]).

Denote by Fζ, [formula], the matrix of the operator Φζ, acting from [formula] into [formula], with respect to the bases [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Then

We may write

Set

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Thus, we may write

[formula]

where A0,ζ, C0,ζ are given by ([\ref=f2_50]),([\ref=f2_51]), and W,T are given by ([\ref=f2_52]),([\ref=f2_53]).

Consider the block representation of the operator [formula] with respect to the decomposition [formula]:

[formula]

Of course, the matrices of operators A0,ζ, B0,ζ, C0,ζ, D0,ζ are matrices A0,ζ, B0,ζ, C0,ζ, D0,ζ, respectively. Observe that the matrix A0,ζ is invertible, since A0,ζ  =  PH-(EH  -  ζV)PH-  =  EH-  -  ζPH-VPH-, is invertible, [formula]. Set

[formula]

The matrix of V0 in the basis [formula] we denote by [formula]:

[formula]

Observe that using definitions of vk,uj, the elements of the matrix [formula] can be calculated explicitly by the prescribed moments.

We may write for the resolvent function of V0:

[formula]

Then for the corresponding matrices we may write:

[formula]

where

[formula]

By the convergence in ([\ref=f2_53_5]) we mean the convergence of the corresponding entries of matrices.

Observe that the Frobenius formula for the inverse of the block matrix ([\cite=cit_7000_G]) is still valid for the block representations of bounded operators as in ([\ref=f2_53_1]), if the following operator

[formula]

has a bounded inverse. This can be verified by the direct multiplication of the corresponding block representations. Notice that in our case Hζ has a bounded inverse. In fact, we may write

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

Therefore the operator [formula] is invertible.

Suppose that there exists [formula], [formula], such that Hζy  =  0. Set u: =   -  A- 10,ζB0,ζy. Then

[formula]

This contradicts to the invertibility of Q. Since H- 1ζ acts in the finite-dimensional space [formula], it is bounded.

Applying the Frobenius formula we get

[formula]

where by stars [formula] we denote the blocks which are not of interest for us.

Denote by M2,ζ(Φ) the matrix of the operator [formula] in the basis [formula], [formula]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

Let {uj}ρ - 1j = 0 be a set of elements which were obtained by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of {y-k}N - 1k = 0. Observe that ρ  ≥  1. In the opposite case we have y-k  =  0, 0  ≤  k  ≤  N - 1. By ([\ref=f2_45_22]) we obtain that the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is determinate, what contradicts to our assumptions. Set

[formula]

Consider the following operator:

[formula]

as an operator in the (finite-dimensional) Hilbert space H-ρ. Its matrix in the basis {uj}ρ - 1j = 0 we denote by Jζ. It is given by

[formula]

Here A1,ζ is a matrix standing in the first ρ rows and the first ρ columns of the matrix A- 10,ζ; A2,ζ is a matrix standing in the first ρ rows of the matrix A- 10,ζ; A3,ζ is a matrix standing in the first ρ columns of the matrix A- 10,ζ.

Consider the following operator from [formula] to H-ρ:

[formula]

where [formula]. Let K be the matrix of K with respect to the orthonormal bases [formula] and {uj}ρ - 1j = 0:

[formula]

By ([\ref=f2_45_22]) we may write that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

establishes a one-to-one correspondence between all analytic in [formula] operator-valued functions Φ·, which values are linear contractions from [formula] into [formula], and all solutions M(λ) = (mk,j(λ))N - 1k,j = 0 of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]).

Observe that [formula] is the element in the j-th row and k-th column of the matrix M3,ζ of the operator J1,ζ: = K*JζK in the basis {en}N - 1n = 0. We may write

[formula]

[formula]

Set

[formula]

Then the following relation

[formula]

establishes a one-to-one correspondence between all analytic in [formula], [formula]-valued functions Fζ, which values are such that F*ζFζ  ≤  Iδ, and all solutions M(λ) of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]). Set

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Then the right-hand side of ([\ref=f2_55_3]) becomes

[formula]

Let the matrix Hamburger moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) be given and condition ([\ref=f1_4]), with Γn from ([\ref=f1_3]), be satisfied. Suppose that the moment problem is indeterminate. All solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) can be obtained from the following relation:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] are analytic in [formula], matrix-valued functions defined by ([\ref=f2_55_4]), with values in [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], respectively. Here [formula] is an analytic in [formula], [formula]-valued function which values are such that [formula], [formula]. Conversely, each analytic in [formula], [formula]-valued function such that [formula], [formula], generates by relation ([\ref=f2_59]) a solution of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]). The correspondence between all analytic in [formula], [formula]-valued functions such that [formula], [formula], and all solutions of the moment problem ([\ref=f1_1]) is bijective.

Proof. The proof follows from the preceding considerations. [formula]

The Nevanlinna-type formula for the matrix Hamburger moment problem in a general case.

S.M. Zagorodnyuk

In this paper we obtain a Nevanlinna-type formula for the matrix Hamburger moment problem in a general case. We only assume that the problem is solvable and has more that one solution. We express the matrix coefficients of the corresponding linear fractional transformation in terms of the prescribed moments. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the determinacy of the moment problem are given.
