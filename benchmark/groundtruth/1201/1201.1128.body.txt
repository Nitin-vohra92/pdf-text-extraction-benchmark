Introduction

Throughout this article, we work over [formula], the complex number field. We will freely use the standard notations in [\cite=kamama], [\cite=komo], and [\cite=bchm]. In this article we deal a topic related to the abundance conjecture:

Let (X,Δ) be a projective log canonical pair such that Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor and KX  +  Δ is nef. Then KX  +  Δ is semi-ample.

Let [formula] be the real number field [formula] or the rational number field [formula]. The following conjecture seems to be the most difficult and important conjecture for proving Conjecture [\ref=conj-abun-nef]:

Let (X,Δ) be a projective log canonical pair such that Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor and KX  +  Δ is pseudo-effective. Then there exists an effective [formula]-divisor D such that [formula].

Note that the above conjecture is obviously true for big log canonical divisors. Thus it is important for pseudo-effective log canonical divisors which are not big. In this article, we study a difference between Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] for [formula] and [formula]. One of the importence of Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] for [formula] is motivated in Birkar's framework on the existence of minimal models [\cite=bir-exiII]. In his construction, Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] must be formulated for log canonical pairs with [formula]-boundary when we construct minimal models for even smooth projective varieties. For reducing Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] in the case where [formula] to the case where (X,Δ) is kawamata log terminal with [formula]-boundary, we need the following two conjectures (cf. Lemma [\ref=term_pe_fibration_lemma]):

Let [formula] and I  ⊂  [0,1] a set satisfying the DCC. Then there is a finite subset I0  ⊂  I such that if

X is a projective variety of dimension d,

(X,Δ) is log canonical,

[formula] where δi∈I,

[formula],

then δi∈I0.

Let [formula], Γ  ⊂  [0,1] be a set satisfying the DCC and, let [formula] be a finite set. Then the set

[formula]

satisfies the ACC. Here D is [formula]-Cartier and Δ∈Γ (resp. D∈S) means [formula] where δi∈Γ (resp. [formula] where di∈S) and lct(X,Δ;D) =  sup{t  ≥  0|(X,Δ + tD) is lc}.

The proofs of the above two conjectures are announced by Hacon-[formula]Kernan-Xu. See [\cite=dhp-ext].

Namely the main theorem of this article is the following:

Assume that the global ACC conjecture ([\ref=gacc]) in dimension ≤  n, the ACC conjecture for log canonical thresholds ([\ref=acclct]) in dimension ≤  n, and the abundance conjecture ([\ref=conj-abun-nef]) in dimension ≤  n - 1. Then the non-vanishing conjecture ([\ref=conj-non-vani-k]) for n-dimensional klt pairs in the case where [formula] implies that for n-dimensional lc pairs in the case where [formula].

Under assuming that Conjecture [\ref=gacc] and Conjecture [\ref=acclct] hold, by combining with [\cite=dhp-ext], we can reduce Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] in the case where [formula] to the case where X is smooth and Δ = 0. The proof of Theorem [\ref=main-real] was inspired by Section 8 in [\cite=dhp-ext] and discussions the author had with Birkar in Paris.

In Section [\ref=RC-non], we also show the log non-vanishing theorem (= Theorem [\ref=main-RC-non-van]) for rationally connected varieties by the same argument.

A variety X / Z means that a quasi-projective normal variety X is projective over a quasi-projective variety Z. A rational map [formula] denotes a rational map [formula] over Z. For a contracting birational map [formula] and an [formula]-Weil divisor D on X, an [formula]-Weil divisor DY means the strict transform of D on Y.

On the existence of minimal models after Birkar

In this section we introduce the definitions of minimal models in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov and some results on the existence of minimal models after Birkar.

The followings are remarks:

Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] in the case where the dimension ≤  n - 1 and [formula] implies the existence of relative log minimal models in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov over a quasi-projective base Z for effective dlt pairs over Z in dimension n. See [\cite=bir-exiII].

Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] in the case where the dimension ≤  n - 1 and [formula] implies Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] in the case where the dimension ≤  n and [formula] over a non-point quasi-projective base Z. See [\cite=bchm].

When (X / Z,B) is purely log terminal, a log minimal model of (X / Z,B) in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov is the traditional one as in [\cite=komo] and [\cite=bchm]. See [\cite=bir-exiI].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main-real]

In this section, we give the proof of Theorem [\ref=main-real]. The proof of following lemma is essentially same as the proof of [\cite=dhp-ext].

Assume that the global ACC conjecture ([\ref=gacc]) in dimension ≤  n and the ACC conjecture for log canonical thresholds ([\ref=acclct]) in dimension ≤  n. Let (X,Δ) be a [formula]-factorial projective dlt pair such that Δ is an [formula]-divisor and KX  +  Δ is pseudo-effective. Suppose that there exists a sequence of effective divisors {Δi} such that Δi  ≤  Δi + 1, KX  +  Δi is not pseudo-effective for any i  ≥  0, and

[formula]

Then there exists a contracting birational map [formula] such that there exists a projective morphism f':X'  →  Z with connected fibers satisfying:

(X',Δ') is [formula]-factorial log canonical and ρ(X' / Z) = 1,

[formula],

Δ' - Δ'i is f'-ample for some i, and

[formula]

where Δ' and Δ'i are the strict transform of Δ and Δi on X'.

Set Γi  =  Δ  -  Δi. Then KX  +  Δi + xΓi is also not pseudo-effective for every non-negative number x < 1. For any i and non-negative number x < 1, we can take a Mori fiber space fx,i:Yx,i  →  Zx,i of (X,Δi + xΓi) by [\cite=bchm]. Then there exists a positive number ηx,i such that

[formula]

Note that x  <  ηx,i  ≤  1 and [formula] since KYx,i  +  ΔYx,ii  +  ΓYx,ii is pseudo-effective.

Put

[formula]

Assume by contradiction that lj,i  <  1 for some infinitely many j. Fix such an index j0. Then we take a j1 such that lj1,i  <  1 and lj0,i  <  xj1  <  1. Since lj1,i  <  1, we take lj1,i  <  xj2  <  1. By repeating, we construct increasing sequences {xjk}k and {ljk,i}k. Actually this is a contradiction to Conjecture [\ref=acclct].

Thus, for any i, there exists non-negative number yi < 1 such that

[formula]

[formula]

and (Yyi,i,ΔYyi,ii  +  ηyi,iΓYyi,ii) is log canonical from Claim [\ref=rem-real-lct-term]. Set Ωi  =  Δi  +  ηyi,iΓi and Yi = Yyi,i. Then we see the following:

We can take a subsequence {ykj} of {yi} such that

[formula]

since Ωi  →  Δ when i  →    ∞  . From Conjecture [\ref=gacc], by taking a subsequence again, we may assume that it holds that

[formula]

for a general fiber Fk0 of fk0 and l > 0 since all coefficients of ΩYkjkj|Fkj have only finitely many possibilities. Let i = k0, then we see that

[formula]

Thus we construct such a model as in Lemma [\ref=term_pe_fibration_lemma].

We do not know whether the above birational map φ is (KX  +  Δ)-non-positive or not.

We will show it by induction on dimension. In particular we may assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] in the case where the dimension ≤  n - 1 and [formula] holds. Now we may assume that (X,Δ) is a [formula]-factorial divisorial log terminal pair due to a dlt blow-up (cf. [\cite=kokov-lc-dubois], [\cite=fujino-fund] and [\cite=fujino-ss]). First we show Theorem [\ref=main-real] in the following case.

We may assume that we can take a sequence of effective [formula]-divisors {Δi} such that Δi  ≤  Δi + 1, KX  +  Δi is not pseudo-effective for any i  ≥  0, and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=term_pe_fibration_lemma], we can take a contracting birational map [formula] such that there exists a projective morphism f':X'  →  Z with connected fibers satisfying:

(X',Δ') is [formula]-factorial log canonical and ρ(X' / Z) = 1,

[formula],

Δ' - Δ'i is f'-ample for some i, and

[formula]

where Δ' and Δ'i are the strict transform of Δ and Δi on X'. By taking resolution of φ, we may assume that φ is morphism. Thus we see that κσ((KX  +  Δ)|F) = 0 for a general fiber of [formula], where κσ(  ·  ) is the numerical dimension (cf. [\cite=nakayama-zariski-abun] and [\cite=lehmann-comparing]). When dim   Z = 0, we see that κσ(KX  +  Δ) = 0. Then, from the abundance theorem of numerical Kodaira dimension zero for [formula]-divisors (cf. [\cite=ambro-canonical], [\cite=nakayama-zariski-abun], [\cite=duruel-nu0], [\cite=kawamata-abunnuzero], [\cite=ckp-num], and [\cite=g3]), we may assume that [formula]. Then, by Remark [\ref=rem_real_bir1] and Kawamata's theorem (cf. [\cite=fujino-kawamata], [\cite=kamama]), there exists a good minimal model f'':(X'',Δ'')  →  Z of (X,Δ) over Z. And let g:X''  →  Z' be the morphism of the canonical model Z' of (X,Δ). Then Z'  →  Z is a birational morphism. From Ambro's canonical bundle formula for [formula]-divisors (cf. [\cite=ambro-canonical] and [\cite=fg2]) there exists an effective divisor ΓZ' on Z' such that [formula]. By the hypothesis on induction, we can take an effective divisor D' on Z' such that [formula].

Next we show Theorem [\ref=main-real] in the case where (X,Δ) is divisorial log terminal and Δ is an [formula]-divisor.

We take a decreasing sequence {εi} of positive numbers such that lim i  →    ∞εi = 0. Let [formula] or 0 be the reduced part of Δ, Sk its components, and Δi  =  Δ  -  εiS. We show Theorem [\ref=main-real] by induction on the number r of the components of S. If r = 0, Case [\ref=QtoRinKLT] implies Conjecture [\ref=conj-non-vani-k] for KX  +  Δ. When r > 0, we may assume that KX  +  Δi is not pseudo-effective from Case [\ref=QtoRinKLT] and KX  +  Δ  -  δSk is not pseudo-effective for any k and δ > 0. Then by Lemma [\ref=term_pe_fibration_lemma] we can take a contracting birational map [formula] such that there exists a projective morphism f':X'  →  Z with connected fibers satisfying:

(X',Δ') is [formula]-factorial log canonical and ρ(X' / Z) = 1,

[formula],

Δ' - Δ'i is f'-ample for some i, and

[formula]

where Δ' and Δ'i are the strict transform of Δ and Δi on X'. Take log resolutions p:W  →  X of (X,Δ) and q:W  →  X' of (X',Δ') such that [formula]. Set the effective divisor Γ satisfying

[formula]

where E is an effective divisor such that E has no common components with Γ. Set the strict transform [formula] and [formula] of Sk and S respectively on W. From Lemma [\ref=term_pe_fibration_lemma] (3) [formula] dominates Z. By the same arguments as the proof of Case [\ref=QtoRinKLT], we may assume that dim   Z  ≥  1. Then, by Remark [\ref=rem_real_bir1], the abundance conjecture ([\ref=conj-abun-nef]) in dimension ≤  n - 1, and [\cite=fg3] (cf. [\cite=fujino-bpf]), there exists a good minimal model f':(W',Γ')  →  Z of (W,Γ) in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov over Z. If some [formula] contracts by the birational map [formula] (may not be contracting), then [formula] is pseudo-effective for some δ > 0 from the positivity property of the definition of minimal models (cf. Definition [\ref=real-def-minimalmodelsenseofBS]). Thus [formula] is also pseudo-effective. But this is a contradiction to the assumption of (X,Δ). Thus we see that any [formula] dose not contract by the birational map [formula]. Let g:W'  →  Z' be the morphism of the canonical model Z' of (W,Γ). Then Z'  →  Z is a birational morphism since κσ((KW  +  Γ)|F) = 0 for a general fiber F of [formula]. Thus some strict transform Tk of [formula] on W' dominates Z'. Now [formula] for some [formula]-Cartier divisor C on Z'. By hypothesis of the induction on dimension, there exists an effective [formula]-divisor DTk on Tk such that

[formula]

Since Tk dominates Z', there also exists some effective [formula]-divisor G such that [formula]. Thus

[formula]

This implies the non-vanishing of KX  +  Δ.

We finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=main-real].

Log non-vanishing theorem for rationally connected varieties

From the same argument as the proof of Case [\ref=QtoRinKLT] we see the following theorem:

Assume that the global ACC conjecture ([\ref=gacc]) and the ACC conjecture for log canonical thresholds ([\ref=acclct]) in dimension ≤  n. Let X be a rationally connected variety of dimension n and Δ an effective [formula]-Weil divisor such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier and (X,Δ) is kawamata log terminal. If KX  +  Δ is pseudo-effective, then there exists an effective [formula]-Cartier divisor D such that [formula].

We show by induction on dimension. First, we may assume that X is smooth by taking a log resolution of (X,Δ). From [\cite=dhp-ext], the pseudo-effective threshold of Δ for KX is also a rational number. Thus we may assume that KX  +  Δ  -  εΔ is not pseudo-effective for any positive number ε. We take a decreasing sequence {εi} of positive numbers such that lim i  →    ∞εi = 0. Let Δi  =  Δ  -  εiΔ. Then, by the same argument as the proof of Case [\ref=QtoRinKLT], we may assume that there exists a projective morphism f:X  →  Z of connected fibers to normal variety Z such that κσ((KX  +  Δ)|F) = 0 for a general fiber F of f and [formula]. Moreover we see that Z is also a rationally connected variety. Then we see that Theorem [\ref=main-RC-non-van] by [\cite=gl1] (cf. [\cite=laigood]) and the hypothesis of induction.
