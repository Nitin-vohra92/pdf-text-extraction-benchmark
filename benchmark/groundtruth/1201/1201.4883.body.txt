VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy of the candidate black-hole X-ray binary MAXI J1659-152 in outburst

Introduction

Transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) form a sub-class of compact binary systems in which a neutron star or a black hole accretes matter from a low-mass companion through Roche-lobe overflow and occasionally undergo X-ray outbursts, during which their X-ray flux increases by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the quiescent state ([\citealt=Tanaka1995xrbi]; [\citealt=vanParadijs1995]). These outbursts have been observed on the timescales from a few weeks to several years. In outburst the X-ray emission of these systems is directly related to the accretion process and originates from the inner accretion disk while the optical emission is dominated from the reprocessed emission from the accretion disk with some contribution from the heated surface of the companion star. Many transient LMXBs have been studied in detail in the X-rays, but for only a few systems simultaneous high quality optical spectroscopy has been obtained during their outburst (e.g. GX 339-4: [\citealt=Soria1999], XTE J1118+480: [\citealt=Dubus2001]). The latter is important to study the large-scale physical structure of the accretion disk.

On September 25, 2010, at UT 08h05, the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; [\citealt=Barthelmy2005]) onboard the Swift satellite was triggered by a transient source, first thought to be a gamma-ray burst: GRB 100925A [\citep=Mangano2010]. On the same day, the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) satellite [\citep=Matsuoka2009] also reported the discovery of a new transient, named MAXI J1659-152 (hereafter MAXI1659), at a position consistent with the GRB [\citep=Negoro2010]. Subsequently, a number of space-based and ground-based observations were carried out to investigate the nature of this source (e.g. [\citealt=vanderHorst2010], [\citealt=Vovk2010]). Immediately after the BAT trigger, the UltraViolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) onboard the Swift satellite [\citep=Roming2005] detected the optical counterpart of MAXI1659 with a magnitude of 16.8 in the white filter [\citep=Marshall2010].

On September 25 at UT 23h39, the X-shooter spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) was pointed at the optical counterpart and registered an optical to near-infrared spectrum of MAXI1659 revealing the Galactic origin of the source [\citep=deUgartePostigo2010]. The X-shooter spectrum showed various broad double peaked emission line profiles, as typically observed in X-ray binaries when they actively accrete.

Subsequent studies of the X-ray spectral and timing behaviour of the source ([\citealt=Kalamkar2011], [\citealt=Kennea2011], [\citealt=MunozDarias2011]) demonstrated that the system is a candidate black-hole X-ray binary. MAXI1659 also shows regular, though not really periodic dips in the X-ray intensity with a period of approximately 2.42h ([\citealt=Kennea2011], [\citealt=Kuulkers2011]), pointing at a high orbital inclination. This is also interpreted as an orbital period and makes MAXI1659 the shortest orbital period black-hole X-ray binary candidate with an estimated distance of ~   7 kpc and possibly an M5 dwarf companion ([\citealt=Kuulkers2010], [\citealt=Belloni2010b], [\citealt=Kuulkers2011]). Later on, the distance was suggested to be within 1.6 - 4.2 kpc [\citep=MillerJones2011]. Like some other transient LMXBs (e.g. Swift J1753-0127, XTE J1118+480, GRO J0422+32, cf. [\citealt=Zurita2008] ) MAXI1659 is at a high Galactic latitude (b = +16.49[formula]).

In this paper, we report on the optical to near-infrared VLT/X-shooter spectra of MAXI1659 taken during the beginning of its 2010 X-ray outburst (see [\citealt=deUgartePostigo2010] for a preliminary report).

Observations and data reduction

We observed the optical counterpart of MAXI1659 on September 25, 2010, starting at UT 23h39 (MJD 55464.99) after triggering the X-shooter guaranteed time GRB program (086.A-0073, PI Fynbo) on the VLT. X-shooter is a wide-band, medium-resolution spectrograph, consisting of 3 arms. Each arm is an independent cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph with its own slit unit. The incoming light is split using dichroics, resulting in three spectral ranges: UVB (3000-5900 Å), VIS (5500-10200 Å) and NIR (10000-24800 Å). A detailed description of the instrument is provided by [\citet=D'Odorico2006] and [\citet=Vernet2011].

We obtained two spectra of MAXI1659 of 600s, starting at UT 23h39 and UT 23h50, at two different nodding positions on the slit. A slit width of 1.0arcsec was used for the UVB arm while a 0.9arcsec slit was used for the VIS and NIR arm; the corresponding resolving power is R ~   5100, 7500, and 5700, respectively. A telluric standard star (HIP083448) was observed immediately after the MAXI1659 observations. The spectrophotometric standard (Feige 110) was observed the night before, with the same slit configuration as used for MAXI1659. The seeing was 1.8arcsec in the V  band.

We used the ESO X-shooter pipeline version 1.2.0 ([\citealt=Goldoni2006], [\citealt=Modigliani2010]) to obtain the wavelength calibrated and rectified two-dimensional spectra. The observations were reduced both in nodding and in staring mode, where in the latter case the two exposures were reduced separately. The one-dimensional spectrum was extracted and normalized using the standard IRAF routines apall and continuum. The resultant spectrum was corrected for the Earth's motion with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) and the NIR spectrum was corrected for telluric absorption lines. The complete X-shooter spectrum was flux calibrated order-by-order relative to the flux table of spectrophotometric standard Feige 110. The obtained signal to noise ratio for the combined spectra is 46, 37 and 8 in the UVB, VIS and NIR arm, respectively.

We also analysed the archival optical and ultraviolet observations of MAXI1659 obtained with UVOT onboard the Swift satellite starting on September 26, 2010 at UT 0h07, 8 minutes after the X-shooter observations (see also [\citealt=Kennea2011]). The image data of each of the six filters used were summed using uvotimsum and photometry of the source in individual sequences was derived with uvotsource. MAXI1659 is clearly detected at a significance of >  50σ in all six filters (1900-5500 Å). Three trial extraction region radii of 3arcsec, 4arcsec, and 5arcsec were used, and the magnitude in each filter were derived from the range of output values.

Results

Emission lines

The X-shooter spectrum of MAXI1659 includes a number of emission lines of H, He  i and He  ii. Fig. 1 displays the normalized X-shooter spectrum of MAXIJ1659 in the range 3000-10000 Å  where all identified spectral lines are labelled at their respective wavelengths. Among the hydrogen lines, we detect the Balmer series from Hα up to Hη and the Paschen series from Paβ up to Pa-11. Fig. 2 displays the three strongest line profiles on a velocity scale showing a double-peaked structure. Table 1 lists all the spectral lines detected along with the line-profile parameters, measured using the IRAF routine splot.

All emission lines are very broad: the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is in the range of 1500-2000 km s- 1. The peak separation is measured as the difference in the central position of two gaussians fitted to the wing of each individual component; for the weaker emission-line profiles, it is difficult to determine whether they are also double-peaked. The peak separation varies from 918 to 1175 km s- 1, with a clear increasing trend among the H Balmer lines, except for Hα (see Fig. 3). A similar trend in the peak-to-peak separation has been observed in GX 339-4 but among H, He  i and He  ii lines [\citep=Wu2001]. Such a trend indicates that higher excitation lines show a larger peak separation, i.e. they are formed closer to the black hole where the disk is hotter and more rapidly rotating. However, in our spectra, the He lines do not seem to follow this trend (Fig. 3). A possible explanation may be that the He lines are predominantly produced near the hot spot (see below). The disk velocity of the system is 156 ±   42 km s- 1, measured as the difference of the velocity of the center of the two peaks of a line with respect to its rest velocity. Only the strongest emission lines are used to measure the disk velocity.

In a number of LMXBs, a Bowen blend is detected at λ 4650-4660 Å, usually attributed to the high excitation lines of the N  iii λ4634-4641 Å /C  iii λ4647-4650 Å formed due to the Bowen fluorescence mechanism (BFM, [\citealt=McClintock1975], [\citealt=Steeghs2002]; [\citealt=Casares2006]). In MAXI1659 we detect a broad but weak emission line feature centered at 4628 Å with a FWHM of 2640 km s- 1 which is likely due to the Bowen blend. However we detect no narrow peaks/structures corresponding to the individual N  iii components in this blend. The central velocity of this feature is -775  km s- 1, which is very different from the disk velocity of the system (156 km s- 1) and may be related to the disk wind. In another black hole binary XTE J1118+480, the Bowen blend was detected as a weak feature during outburst but was observed to vary in phase with He  ii 4686 Å  [\citep=Dubus2001].  Assuming that we observe the varying peak of the Bowen blend, we would expect to detect the red, rather than the blue component as the hydrogen and helium lines show the variability in the red component (see Section 3.2).

Emission-line variability

During the two 10 minute-observations of MAXI1659, the red wing of the emission-line profile shows significant variability (cf. Fig. 2). During the two observations, the FWHM and the peak separation remain constant while the equivalent width (EW) of the lines increases (e.g., the EW of Hα increases from -7.3±  0.4 to -8.3±  0.4 Å, cf. Fig. 2). This variability is detected in different lines at the same velocity. As these lines originate in different parts of the spectrum (even in different spectrograph arms) this excludes the possibility that the observed variations are of instrumental nature.

Our X-shooter observations sample the orbital period of the source in which strong dipping is expected as estimated using an X-ray dip activity ephemeris (Kuulkers et al. 2012 in prep). The lack of simultaneous X-ray observations and, the fact that dips in this source show highly irregular structure which can last from a few minutes to as long as [formula] min (Kuulkers et al. 2011, Kuulkers et al. 2012 in prep), does not allow us to know which percentage of the X-shooter observations is affected by dips. However, the observed variability in MAXI1659 is similar to that observed in XTE J1118+480 [\citep=Dubus2001]; in this system the He  ii 4686 Å line time series displays an S-wave pattern consistent with the photometric (i.e. orbital) period of 4.1h. According to Dubus et al. the variable component of the He  ii line (as well as that observed in Hα, Hβ and the Bowen blend) most likely originates in the hot spot of the accretion disk where the accretion flow impacts on the disk.

Interstellar spectrum and distance to MAXI1659

The spectrum includes a number of interstellar lines: the Na  i D and Ca  ii H&K lines, and a few diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs); their EW is listed in Table 2. [\citet=Cox2005] measured the DIB spectrum in the strongly reddened sightline towards the X-ray binary 4U1907+97 (E(B - V) = 3.45) and compared the EWs of several DIBs to those observed in the well-studied sightlines towards BD+631964 (E(B - V) = 1.01) and HD183143 (E(B - V) = 1.28). We calculated the EW ratio of the DIBs detected in MAXI1659 to those in the three mentioned sightlines, and arrive at a ratio of 0.06, 0.13 and 0.08, i.e. an E(B - V) estimate of 0.21, 0.13 and 0.10 mag, respectively. As we do not know the value of RV in the line of sight to MAXI1659, we used the RV value for the respective sightlines (2.75, 3.1, and 3.3), and by using AV = E(B - V)* RV we estimate AV as 0.57, 0.40, and 0.33 mag, respectively. Thus, based on the DIB spectrum, AV is 0.4  ±  0.1 mag.

Adding the Swift-UVOT data to extend the spectral coverage of the X-shooter spectrum towards the ultraviolet, we note a broad feature at 2175 Å  ("the extinction bump") which suggests a higher value of the optical extinction (see Section 3.4). Given the height of MAXI1659 above the Galactic plane (z  ~  1 kpc, see below), it may well be that the (still unidentified) DIB carriers are concentrated towards the Galactic plane, thus providing a lower limit to the total extinction.

The EW of the DIB at 5780 Å can be related to the neutral hydrogen column density NH; using Cox et al. (2005) a rough estimate of NH = 0.6 ×   1021 cm- 2 is obtained. Given the above, we also expect this to be a lower limit to the total NH value. Swift X-ray observations [\citep=Kennea2011] indicate that the interstellar NH value is 2.4  ×  1021 cm- 2.

An absorption feature is present in the red wing of the Hβ emission line profile. This feature has been observed in other systems (e.g. [\citealt=Buxton2003], [\citealt=Soria2000], [\citealt=Dubus2001]) and has been interpreted as a redshifted absorption component in Hβ; however, we think it most likely is due to the strong DIB at 4882 Å [\citep=Jenniskens1994].

The Na  i D and Ca  ii H&K interstellar lines are centered at a velocity of 14  ±  10 km s- 1 with respect to the LSR of the solar environment. A kinematic model of the differential Galactic rotation [\citep=Brand1993] predicts a steady increase of the radial velocity in the direction of MAXI1659 from 0 km s- 1 to 122 km s- 1 at 8 kpc. The measured radial velocity distribution implies a lower limit to the distance of MAXI1659 of 4  ±  1 kpc. The corresponding height above the Galactic plane is z  ≥  1 kpc.

Spectral energy distribution

Fig. 4 shows the flux-calibrated X-shooter spectrum of the optical counterpart of MAXI1659 extended to the ultra-voilet region using the Swift-UVOT photometry. Due to estimated slitlosses, the X-shooter spectrum was scaled up by a factor of 1.75. The thus obtained SED is consistent with the UVOT photometry.

The neutral hydrogen column density increased during the outburst due to absorption intrinsic to the source [\citep=Kennea2011]; the initial, and thus likely the interstellar value was NH  =  (2.4  ±  0.3)  ×  1021 cm- 2 on MJD 55464 at the start of the outburst. This corresponds [\citep=Guver2009] to a visual extinction of AV  =  1.1  ±  0.2 mag. This value is consistent with the value for AV necessary to remove the extinction bump at 2175 Å  in the UVOT photometry. The X-shooter spectrum and UVOT photometry are de-reddened adopting this value and using the extinction laws of [\citet=Cardelli1989] and [\citet=Mathis1990]. The dereddened spectral energy (SED) distribution becomes flat with a continuum rising to the blue as expected for LMXBs in outburst, as shown in red color in Fig. 4.

The whole UV-optical-NIR spectrum can be fitted by a single power law with slope β = -1.37 ±   0.14 (where λFλ  =  λβ). The spectrum cannot be fitted by a single temperature blackbody. For an optically thick, non-irradiated disk, we expect a power law with an index of β  ~   - 1.33 describing a multi-temperature blackbody extending from the optical/NIR regime to the far-UV [\citep=Frank2002]. The intrinsic spectrum of MAXI1659 is remarkably consistent with this canonical spectrum. For most LMXBs in outburst, β ranges from -2.5 to -1.5 as observed from their optical/NIR spectra and originates in the irradiated outer disk (e.g. [\citealt=Hynes2005]). There is no significant variation in the spectral slope or colour of the UV-optical SED during the outburst [\citep=Kennea2011]. This suggests that the non-irradiated disc dominates the emission throughout the entire outburst of MAXI1659.

Discussion

The optical to near-infrared spectrum of MAXI1659, taken during the beginning of the 2010 X-ray outburst, is consistent with a black-hole LMXB in the low-hard state (see [\citealt=Kennea2011] for the determination of the source state at the time of our X-shooter observations). The spectrum includes a number of double-peaked emission profiles revealing the fast rotation of the accretion disk. The observed trend in peak separation of the hydrogen Balmer line with excitation energy reveals the rotation profile of the accretion disk, where the inner and hotter regions of the disk rotate faster than the outer regions [\citep=Smak1981].

Although we obtained only two spectra, a significant increase is observed in the red peak of the emission lines on a ten-minute timescale. This timescale is much shorter than the timescale associated with the outburst and the viscous timescale of the disk, estimated of the order of days to weeks for typical accretion disk parameters [\citep=Frank2002]. It is possible that the observed change in the double-peaked emission lines is related to an S-wave pattern as observed in XTE J1118+480 [\citep=Dubus2001] caused by the revolving hot spot where the accretion stream from the low-mass companion star impacts onto the disk. This may then also explain why the He lines do not follow the same trend in varying peak separation as the H Balmer lines. An alternative explanation for the observed line-profile variability could be the warping of the disk propagating with time [\citep=Maloney1997]. Another possibility could be the presence of a revolving structure in the accretion disk which has also been proposed as a possibly cause of the X-ray dipping behavior ([\citealt=DiazTrigo2006], [\citealt=DiazTrigo2009], [\citealt=Boirin2005]).

The SED extending from the far-ultraviolet down to the near-infrared is flat when dereddened with AV  =  1.1 mag, consistent with an optically thick, non-irradiated accretion disk (Fig 4.). The visual extinction is consistent with that derived from the 2175 Å feature and the observed NH from the X-ray observations. The DIBs indicate a smaller extinction, suggesting that the (unknown) DIB carrier(s) are concentrated towards the Galactic plane, apparently unlike the carrier of the 2175 Å feature. A supporting argument is that MAXI1659 is located far above the Galactic plane (~  1 kpc for a distance of 4 kpc), like the other very few LMXBs [\citep=White1996]. which are possibly ejected out of the Galactic plane due to large kick received during the supernova explosion; alternatively, they are remnants of the population of massive stars formed during early stages of the evolution of the Galaxy [\citep=Mirabel2001].

The measured spectral slope is similar to that observed in the black-hole LMXB XTE J1118+480: β  ~   - 1.6 [\citep=Dubus2001]. In this source, synchrotron emission from the compact jet is known to contribute a large fraction of the optical/NIR flux in the low-hard state, making the spectrum redder than most usually reported for LMXBs (e.g., [\citealt=Hynes2003]). It is plausible that the jet of MAXI1659 detected at radio frequencies (e.g. [\citealt=vanderHorst2010]) could contribute to the X-shooter spectrum of MAXI1659 as the source was in the low-hard state during the observation, which is commonly associated with compact jets seen in the optical/NIR (e.g. [\citealt=Buxton2004]; [\citealt=Russell2006]; [\citealt=Coriat2009]). It would be interesting to monitor the system during an outburst to study the disk revolution and longer -term evolution in response to the outburst. It will remain very difficult to detect the low-mass companion star and/or measure the mass of the black hole.
