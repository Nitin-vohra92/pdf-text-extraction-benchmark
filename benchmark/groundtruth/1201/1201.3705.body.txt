Contact Moishezon threefolds with second Betti number one

Introduction

A compact complex manifold X of dimension 2n + 1 is said to be a contact manifold if there is a vector bundle sequence

[formula]

where TX is the tangent bundle of X and F a sub-bundle of rank 2n such that the induced map

[formula]

is everywhere non-degenerate. Properly speaking (X,F) is a contact manifold; the line bundle L is called the contact line bundle. It is easy to see that - KX  =  (n + 1)L, that is in case X is a threefold:

[formula]

We refer e.g. to [\cite=Le95] and [\cite=Bu09] for details. There are basically two methods to construct compact contact manifolds.

A simple Lie group gives rise to a Fano contact manifold X by taking the unique closed orbit for the adjoint action of the Lie group on the the projectivised Lie algebra; we refer to [\cite=Be98]. Unless the group is of type A, we have b2(X)  =  1. Specifically, this construction includes [formula], [formula], Grassmannians of lines on quadrics, and some exceptional homogeneous spaces.

given any compact complex manifold M, the projectivised tangent bundle [formula] is a contact manifold.

A famous conjecture of LeBrun and Salamon [\cite=LS94] claims there are no other projective contact manifolds. If b2(X)  ≥  2, this is settled by [\cite=KPSW00] and [\cite=De02]. For results in case b2(X)  =  1, we refer to [\cite=Be98], [\cite=Bu09], [\cite=Bu10], [\cite=Ke01], [\cite=Ke05], [\cite=Le95] and [\cite=Wi00]. Since there is no known example of a compact contact manifold not in the above list, one might wonder whether the projectivity assumption in the conjecture of LeBrun and Salamon is really necessary. Dropping the projectivity assumption, it seems reasonable to assume first that X is not too wild, i.e. X is in class C, which is to say that X is bimeromorphic to a compact Kähler manifold.

In [\cite=FP11] it has been shown that a contact threefold in class C which is not rationally connected must be of the form [formula] with a Kähler surface M. Thus it remains in dimension 3 to treat rationally connected varieties in class C. Notice that these are automatically Moishezon spaces, i.e., carry three algebraically independent meromorphic functions, see Proposition [\ref=prop_rationally_connected_in_class_C]. In fact, the rational connectedness of X implies that H2(X,OX)  =  0. In this short note we treat the case that b2(X)  =  1.

Let X be a smooth threefold in class C with b2(X)  =  1, which is contact for some choice of F  ⊂  TX. Then [formula].

In the projective case, this theorem has first been shown by [\cite=Ye94].

Preliminaries

We will make heavily use of the following theorem of Kollár [\cite=Ko91] and Nakamura.

Let X be a smooth Moishezon threefold with [formula] and let OX(1) be the big ( = effective) generator of Pic(X). Write KX  =  OX(m) with some integer m and assume m  <  0. Then

m  ≥   - 4 and m  =   - 4 if and only if [formula]

m  =   - 3 if and only if X is the 3-dimensional quadric.

If m  =   - 2, then h0(X,OX(1))  ≤  7.

H2(X,OX(1))  =  H3(X,OX(1))  =  0.

For the proof, see [\cite=Ko91], [\cite=Ko91], and [\cite=Ko91], respectively.

Next we collect some basic properties of rationally connected manifolds. Recall that a compact manifold in class C is rationally connected if two general points in X can be joined by a chain of rational curves. For the benefit of the reader we list the following well-known properties and include indications on the proof.

Let X be a rationally connected manifold in class C. Then the following holds.

X is simply connected;

Hq(X,OX)  =  0 for all q  ≥  1; in particular X is Moishezon.

Pic(X) does not have torsion; so if b2(X)  =  1, then [formula]

(1) We refer to [\cite=Ca94]. Notice that in [\cite=Ca94], the manifold is supposed to be Kähler. Since however X is bimeromorphically equivalent to a Kähler manifold, we may choose a birational holomorphic map X̂  →  X with X̂ Kähler, given by a sequence of blow-ups with smooth centers. Then we apply Campana's theorem on X̂ and use the basic fact π1(X̂)  =  π1(X) (it suffices to check that for a single blow-up along a submanifold). (2) Since X is rationally connected, there exists a rational curve C  ⊂  X such that the tangent bundle TX|C is ample, see [\cite=Ko96] (the proof works for manifolds in class C as well). From this fact it follows easily

[formula]

hence by Hodge duality Hq(X,OX)  =  0 for q  >  0. We refer to [\cite=Ko96] for details. In order to show that X is Moishezon, observe that Hq(X̂,OX̂)  =  0 for positive q, in particular H2(X̂,OX̂)  =  0. Thus by Kodaira's classical theorem X̂ is projective and therefore X is Moishezon. (3) Suppose Pic(X) contains a torsion element. Thus there is a non-trivial line bundle M such that [formula] for some positive number m. As a consequence, there is a finite étale cover f:  →  X such that [formula] This contradicts the simply connectedness of X.

Proof of the theorem

To start the proof of the main theorem, we first observe that X is uniruled, see [\cite=FP11]. Furthermore, X is rationally connected, for otherwise by the main Theorem in [\cite=FP11] X is isomorphic to [formula] with a Kähler surface M and b2(X)  ≥  2, a contradiction to our assumption. In particular by Proposition 2.2, X is Moishezon, simply connected and [formula]. Let OX(1) be the effective generator of Pic(X). Since the canonical line bundle KX is divisible by 2 by [\eqref=equ_minus_KX_eq_2L], we have

[formula]

with an even integer m. Since X is uniruled, m must be negative, see [\cite=Ko91]. Applying Proposition [\ref=prop_theorem_Kollar_Nakamura][\ref=item_m_ge_minus_4], we simply have to exclude m  =   - 2. So suppose m  =   - 2, in other words the contact line bundle L  =  OX(1). We will arrive at a contradiction with [\ref=item_m_eq_minus_2] of Proposition [\ref=prop_theorem_Kollar_Nakamura] by calculating the number of sections h0(X,L).

Since c3(X) is the Euler characteristic of X, we have c3(X)  =  b0  -  b1  +  b2  -  b3  +  b4  -  b5  +  b6 with b0  =  b6  =  1, b1  =  b5  =  0 (X being simply connected), and b2  =  b4  =  1 by our assumption). Hence

[formula]

Since the contact form gives an isomorphism [formula], we have c1(F)  =  L. From the short exact sequece 0  →  F  →  TX  →  L  →  0 we obtain

[formula]

In degrees 3 and 2 we obtain, respectively:

[formula]

The Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch [\cite=Pa65] formula for OX gives:

[formula]

and thus:

[formula]

Now Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch for L reads:

[formula]

Since h2(L)  =  h3(L) = 0 by Proposition [\ref=prop_theorem_Kollar_Nakamura], [\ref=item_H2_H3_eq_0], we have h0(L)  =  χ(L)  +  h1(L)  ≥  10. This contradicts part [\ref=item_m_eq_minus_2] of Proposition [\ref=prop_theorem_Kollar_Nakamura].
