A quantum solution to Gibbs Paradox with few particles

Introduction- More than one century ago, J.Willard Gibbs [\cite=Gibbs] pointed out that, if the entropy were not extensive due to the neglection of indistinguishability of particles, there would be an entropy increase after two ideal gases from two containers at thermal equilibrium are mixed. On the contrary, the inverse process would bring the system back to its original state and cause the entropy decrease for the closed system. This apparently violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics(SLT). However, for distinguisable particles, this inverse process would not bring the system to the original inital state, and not violate the SLT.

In many textbooks, e.g., the Ref.[\cite=books], the GP is claimed to be solved by considering the indistinguishability of particle in the view of quantum theory, and adding correction to the expression of entropy. This mixing process will bring no entropy change for identical particles, while additional increase for non-identical ones. However, this pedagogic explanation includes neither the internal properties of particle nor a quantum peculiarity of the problem (e.g., non-commutativity). On this aspect, we still do not understand how the entropy changes disappear only when two gases are the same, even though they can be arbitrary similar. In the classical thermodynamic, it is always able to assumed the substances empirically distinguished, however without defining how small their difference is. Thus, it is expected the perfect resolution of the GP should be referred to the quantum mechanics with intrinsic consideration of indistinguishability, even with internal variables of particles. This point was considered by some authors [\cite=internal2] [\cite=Nieuwenhuizen06] by introducing the internal state phenomenologically, and the discontinues of entropy change is avoided by utilizing another thermodynamic quantity- work.

Another resolution was based on the recognition that the knowledge of difference in particle types serves as information, which enables extracting more work to compensate the entropy increase [\cite=Jaynes1992]. However how the internal state involve in the mixing process is still unknown. On this sense, a fully consistent quantum description of the GP, to our best knowledge, is still lack, especially on the indistinguishability of the particles based on the standard quantum theory, such as the second quantization approach with symmetrizing wave functions. Fortunately, the quantum thermodynamics (QT) [\cite=kieu2006] [\cite=quan] [\cite=htquan2007] has enlighten solutions to some paradoxes in thermodynamics [\cite=htquan2006] [\cite=hdong2011], e,g, the Maxwell's demon (MD) paradox [\cite=MD] [\cite=hdong2011] [\cite=cai2011] with quantum Szilard engine. The QT may only concern the few-particle system, which sometimes is efficient to reveal the underlying principles and intrinsic mechanism.

In this letter, we give a fully quantum solution to the GP involving the symmetrization of wave function of identical particles. We consider the mixing process of two particles confined in a infinite square potential well, which is divided into two sub-cells by a solid wall. Using the exact expression of the density matrix, we demonstrate explicitly that the initial un-mixing systems in the conventional presentation of GP are not in thermal equilibrium with respect to the whole well. For the identical particles, we follow the standard approach of second quantization and correctly write down the thermal equilibrium state of an un-mixing whole system by including internal variables and symmetrizing wave-function. This doing surprisingly restores the original version of GP for both non- and identical particles (Boltzman particles, and bosons/fermions) and solves the GP by showing the same entropy changes. The detailed comparisons with the case ignoring internal state is made to explicitly explain the origin of the paradox. For the cases with more particles, we also demonstrate almost the same result except for a little difference between boson and fermion, due to the finite size effect.

Gibbs paradox with infinite potential well- In thermal equilibrium, the the most probable state of many particles in a containers with two sub-cells of equal volume usually is the situation with each cell containing the equal number of particles. Thus, to show up the essence of the GP, we firstly consider the two particle case, similar to the single molecule case [\cite=szilard1929] for the Szilard heat engine in resolving the MD paradox.

Let us model the whole container as an infinite high square potential well V(x,l) (= 0 for x∈(0,l) and ∞   otherwhere) to trap two particles (see Fig.[\ref=fig:gibbs_standard](a) ). The well is initially separated by the infinite high δ-potential, namely [formula] with v  →    ∞  . With the single particle eigen-wavefuctions [formula] ( [formula]) on left (right) cell corresponding eigen-energies [formula], the eigen-wavefuctions of two distinguishable particle system read as [formula] corresponding to eigen-energies Euvnm = Eun + Evm, for u,v = R,L. With the explicit expressions of eigen-wavefuctions given in the Supplementary Materials (SM), φLn(x) =  [formula] and φRn(x) are supported over the whole domain ( -   ∞  ,  ∞  ) including (0,l). This observation seems trivial, however can serves as the key point to resolve the GP as well as the MD paradox [\cite=hdong2011] [\cite=cai2011] .

To show this, we write down the thermal equilibrium state

[formula]

of two Boltzman particles with inverse temperature β and partition function [formula]. It includes not only the terms with [formula] and [formula] for two particles in the different sub-cells shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:gibbs_standard](a), but also the terms with [formula] and [formula] for two particles in the same sub-cells. If the later terms were ignored as in the conventional description of GP, the initial un-mixing state used here would not be in thermal equilibrium, and thus could not correctly address the very problem in GP correctly. For non-identical particles, we can actually assert that one specified atom in the right sub-cell and another in the left. As emphasized by Jaynes, the specified assertion to distinguishable particles actually reduces the system's entropy. Such difference between non- and identical particles is the very root of the GP. Based on this observation, we solve the GP by introducing internal state to the identical particles to restore the original GP in the next section.

Quantum description - In order to resolve the GP, we would make the situation with equal number of particles in the both sub-cells be the thermal state by referring certain prior information. It is possible for non-identical particles since they could be subject to different potentials. With the similar method, we can prepare the initial thermal state for identical particles with internal variable. Using the "colors" to label the internal degenerate states, the blue [formula] and the red ones [formula]. Let the blue and red particles be trapped respectively in the left and right sub-cells with the Hamiltonian

[formula]

where the potential is shown in Fig.1(b). And we assume that the internal state of the two identical particle are different. Obviously, this assumption assigns one bit information, which brings the identical particle with the same initial un-mixing state as non-identical one. Therefore, the Gibbs mixing could causes entropy increase for both non- and identical particles.

The single particle eigen-wavefunctions of the present system are [formula] and [formula] with corresponding eigen-energy ELn and ERn. Associating with their quantum statistics properties, the two-particle wavefunctions before the Gibbs mixing are symmetrized or anti-symmetrized as

[formula]

with the same eigen-energy [formula]. Here, the sign plus/minus corresponds the boson/fermion case. These eigen-functions determine the density matrix of this system [formula] (for the explicit form see the SM), similar to Eq.(1) with the partition function [formula] .

The mixing process is carried out by moving the right side of left potential to the position x = l and the left side of the right potential to the position x = 0 isothermally, illustrated in Fig.1(b). After the mixing process, two particles are constrained in the larger domain [formula]. The single-particle wavefunctions of this system then become [formula] (degenerate for s = b,r,) with the same eigen-energy En = n2π22 / 2Ml2. The two-particle wavefunctions after mixing [formula] corresponds to eigne-energy [formula], which gives the density matrix [formula] with partition function [formula]. The entropy change in the mixing process is simply calculated by using von Neuman entropy as [formula].

We notice that the calculations about entropy change concern only the eigen-energies, rather than the concrete form of the wavefunction. However, the symmetry type of the wavefucntion determines the counts of states to the partition function. For two non-identical particles with un-symmetrized eigen-wavefunctions [formula], the corresponding eigen- energy simply is EU - Nnm = ELn + ERm. Then, using the wavefunctions after mixing [formula] with the eigen-energies EM - Nnm = En + Em, we obtain the same expression of the entropy increase ΔSN. Therefore, it is concluded that the entropy changes in the process of mixing two bosonic, Fermionic and non-identical particle are the same, namely

[formula]

On this sense, GP is resolved.

It is also meaningful to compare the present results with that without considering the internal state for Bosonic and Fermionic particles. In our consideration, the initial un-mixing state is a thermal state with all the three situations in Eq.([\ref=eq:boltsman]). The mixing process is completed by removing the central potential isothermally. The entropy change ΔS'X and work [formula] are calculated by using the partition functions of un-mixing and mixed particles Z'U - X and Z'M - X with X = B,F,N . Here, we deal with the usual setup in the conversional presentation of GP for non-identical atoms, which is the same as that with internal state. We refer the detailed analysis for different species to Supplement Materials. One prominent feature is that both entropy changes and work done for different species are different, while these are the same in the process above with the correct considerations about internal state. We show these differences in Fig. [\ref=fig:compare]. In Fig. [\ref=fig:compare](a-b), the entropy changes of identical particle approaches zero, while that of non-identical particles is [formula]. The discrepancy just recovers the discontinuousness of entropy changes in conventional presentation of GP. The similar difference in work extraction is illustrated in Fig.[\ref=fig:compare](c-d). In the present model, no internal freedom is probed and no prior information is added for identical particles. In comparison with the previous presentation of GP with internal freedom, we can conclude that the discontinuousness is caused by the different start-point between identical and non-identical particles.

To understand the above result, we recall the conventional presentation of GP that the initial state of the identical particles is formally different from the non-identical ones, which results in no entropy change for mixing identical particles. To our understanding, the same entropy changes are restored, solely by restoring the GP problem with the same start points for the different types of particles. With this observation, we conclude that the GP is rooted in the initial difference of un-mixing state rather than the character of indistinguishability of particles. It is also noticeable that we only utilize the quantum definition of entropy, the von Neuman entropy, other than any phenomenological presentations.

Mixing entropy and work of two particle systems - As for the quantum effect in our approach for GP, the finite size of the well induces many interesting phenomenon. To explicitly demonstrate the effect, we take the bosonic case for example. In terms of the Theta function [formula], the partition functions before and after the Gibbs mixing are expressed[\cite=derivation] as [formula] and [formula] respectively with the parameters [formula]. The straightforward calculation explicitly gives the entropy increase during the mixing process as

[formula]

Using the duality of the Theta-fucntion [formula]we prove that [formula] in the high temperature limit T  →    ∞   or in the classical limit L  →    ∞  . With this observation, the classical result is recovered as [formula]

Very quantum nature is the dependence of entropy change on size of the trap and also on the temperature, illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropychanges](a). The entropy change [formula] in the classical case is marked as gray-dashed line in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropychanges](a-b). The entropy changes tends to the classical one [formula] as the trap size approaches infinite, presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropychanges](a). This confirms our theoretical analysis given above. We also show its dependence on the inverse temperature β in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropychanges] (b). The entropy also tends to the classical case as the inverse temperature approaches zero[formula], since the thermal fluctuation compares well the discreteness of the energy levels in the well. Finally, starting with the correct uses of the eigen-vectors and -energies, we consider work done in the mixing process as the references[\cite=Nieuwenhuizen06] [\cite=Jaynes1992]. The mixing process is performed isothermally, and the work just compensates the free energy change, namely, [formula], which is the same for different species. This seemingly-trivial observation also solves GP. We show in Fig. [\ref=fig:entropychanges](c-d) the work done as function of trap size l and inverse temperature β respectively. With larger trap size, the work approaches zero. However, it is not zero as temperature increase. Similar behavior has also been observed in the insertion process of SHE[\cite=hdong2011]. Theoretically, the work diverges as [formula] as T  →    ∞  . The detailed derivation is presented in Supplement Materials.

Mixing entropy of 4 particle systems- To give prominence to the properties of quantum statistics, we consider the mixing process of four particles. Initially, there are two particles in each sub-cell. The internal states of the particles in the right/left side are all blue/red. Its partition function in thermal equilibrium is initially[\cite=derivation]

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the partition function of a two-particle system confined in a square potential well with width l / 2. For [formula], there exist two limit results: in the quantum limit with low temperature β / l2  →    ∞  , we have [formula]; and in the classical limit [formula], we have [formula]. Together with the partition function[\cite=derivation] [formula] after mixing, we calculate the entropy change is

[formula]

In the classical limit, we have [formula]. Indeed, when deviating from the classical limit or the lower temperature, the entropy change obviously displays the obvious differences between boson and fermion.

If we mix identical particles without considering the internal state, one must start from an equilibrium state with partition function[\cite=derivation] [formula] and that [formula] after mixing. In the classical limit, we obtain the entropy change as [formula]. The results obtained here can be directly generated for the arbitrary atom number N.

Summary-We have resolved the Gibbs paradox in a fully quantum framework with the correct presentations of the initial thermal states of the working substances consisting of the particles with different quantum statistical properties. Here, we utilize a standard quantum description, the wave function symmetrization from the second quantization of the particles with internal variable. The key point is our finding that the problem in the paradox are rooted in the different uses ( somehow misuses) of the initial thermal state for identical and non-identical particles. We use examples with two and four particles to illustrate our comprehensive understanding for GP. We show that the entropy change of identical and non-identical particles are the same for two particle system, but the deference could only be found as the finite size effect in the low temperature, or in the cases with more than two particles.
