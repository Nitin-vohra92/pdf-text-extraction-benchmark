Abstract. Explicit determinant formulas are presented for the τ-functions of the generalized Painlevé equations of type A. This result allows an interpretation of the τ-functions as the Plücker coordinates of the universal Grassmann manifold.

Introduction

For each generalized Cartan matrix of affine type A = (aij)ij∈I, we introduced a representation of the Weyl group W(A) on the rational functions of variables αi,fi,τi, (i∈I) [\cite=affine]. The representation is characterized by the action of the generator si, (i∈I), such that

[formula]

under certain conditions on the constants (uij)ij∈I.

This representation is a generalization of the Bäcklund transformations of the Painlevé equations PIV,PV and PVI. As to the root systems of type A(1)l, it is also known that there exist Painlevé type differential (or difference) system which has the W(A) symmetry [\cite=affine][\cite=higher]. In the context of the Painlevé equations, the variables αi, fi and τi play the role of parameters (or the discrete time variables), dependent variables and the τ-functions, respectively. In [\cite=affine], it is conjectured that the τ-functions have strong regularity. This regularity is crucial for the differential (or difference) systems, since it should be closely related to the Painlevé (or the singularity confinement) properties.

In this paper, we prove the regularity conjecture in the case of affine Weyl groups of type A(1)l and A∞, by constructing explicit determinant formulas for the τ-functions. The determinant formulas allow an interpretation of the τ-functions as Plücker coordinates of the universal Grassmann manifold as in the theory of KP hierarchy [\cite=KP].

The τ-functions

We formulate our results in the case of A∞. For the reduction to A(1)l case, see Remark 1 in the last section.

Let [formula] be the field of rational functions in infinitely many variables α = (αi), f = (fi) and τ = (τi) where [formula]. For each [formula], define an automorphism si of the field K by

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

These automorphisms satisfy the relations

[formula]

and define a representation of the affine Weyl group W = W(A∞) of type A∞. One can extend this representation W to the extended affine Weyl group [formula] by adding the automorphism π defined as

[formula]

The diagram shift π satisfies the relation πsi = si + 1π.

Let Λi [formula] be the fundamental weights of A∞ on which the Weyl group [formula] acts as

[formula]

We also use the notation vi  =  Λi  -  Λi - 1. Then αi =  - Λi - 1 + 2Λi  -  Λi - 1 = vi - vi + 1, and we can put formally [formula]. The action of si on vj is given by the permutation

[formula]

Furthermore, the Weyl group W is identified with the infinite symmetric group S∞ which permutes vj.

There exist a family of rational functions [formula] for [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] is the coefficient of Λi in wΛj. The conjecture in [\cite=affine] states that the function φw(Λj) is a polynomial in α and f with integral coefficients. We will prove this conjecture by constructing an explicit determinant formula for φw(Λj). Since any function φw(Λj) is easily obtained from the case j = 0 by the shift [formula], we will concentrate on the functions φw(Λ0).

Lemma 1. If w1Λ0 = w2Λ0 for w1,w2∈W, then w1(τ0) = w2(τ0). Proof. The condition w1(Λ0) = w2(Λ0) means that the element w = w- 12w1∈W is in the stabilizer W0 of Λ0. An element in W belongs to W0 if and only if the corresponding permutation of [formula] preserves the subset [formula]. Then W0 is a product of permutations of [formula] and [formula]. Hence [formula] and w(τ0) = τ0. [formula]

By this Lemma, the functions φw(Λ0) are parameterized by wΛ0. We will prepare some notations to describe the orbit W.Λ0  =  {wΛ0 | w∈W} whose elements will be parameterized by Young diagrams [\cite=ma].

Let [formula] be a partition of length l = l(λ). The corresponding Young diagram Y is defined by

[formula]

The transposition λ' = Y' is defined by (i,j)∈Y' if and only if (j,i)∈Y. For a partition λ, the corresponding Frobenius symbol

[formula]

is defined by

[formula]

where k =  max {n|λn  ≥  n}. We always identify the three notions, partition λ, Young diagram Y and Frobenius symbol (I,J) by these correspondence.

For w∈W, the element w(Λ0) can be parameterized by the partitions λ = Y = (I,J) as follows.

Recall that [formula]. Then we have [formula], where M is a subset of [formula] different from [formula] only by finite elements. Such subset M (called Maya diagram) corresponds to a Young diagram Y with Frobenius symbol (I,J) by the rule

[formula]

In terms of the Maya diagram M, the coefficient mi of Λi in [formula] is given by

mi = 1, if i∈M and i + 1∉M,

mi =  - 1, if i∉M and i + 1∈M,

mi = 0, if i,i + 1∈M or i,i + 1∉M.

Translating this into the language of the Young diagrams, we have Lemma 2. Let [formula] and let Y be the corresponding Young diagram, then the Young diagram si(Y) corresponding to siw(Λ0) is given as follows,

si(Y) is obtained by adding the node with color i, if mi = 1,

si(Y) is obtained by removing the node with color i, if mi =  - 1,

si(Y) = Y, if mi = 0,

where the color k of the (i,j)-th node is given by k = j - i. In summary, we have Proposition 1. Any element in W.Λ0 can be obtained from Λ0 by the action of [formula] with [formula], [formula]. Hence, the functions φw(Λ0) are uniquely determined by the cocycle condition

[formula]

with the initial condition [formula].

It is convenient to introduce another normalization [formula] defined by

[formula]

Here the normalization factor Nw is a polynomial in α, which is defined, in terms of corresponding Young diagram w(Λ0)  ↔  λ = Y, as

[formula]

Note that when specialized to αi = 1, h(s,1) is nothing but the hook-length of the node s∈Y.

Lemma 3. The normalization factor Nw satisfies the relation

[formula]

Proof. From the Lemma 2 and the condition mk = 1 the Young diagram sk(Y) is obtained from Y by adding one node, say (i0,j0)-th node, with color k = j0 - i0. Since λi0 = j0 - 1 and λ'j0 = i0 - 1, the hook length h(s,α) = vj - λ'j - vλi - i + 1 for s = (i,j)∈Y contains vk or vk + 1 if and only if

s = (i0, * ), with h(s,α) = v* - vk,

s = ( * ,j0), with h(s,α) = vk + 1 - v*.

Under the action of sk, these factors are replaced with the hook length of the same node s in the new diagram sk(Y). Multiplying sk(Nw) by the extra factor vk - vk + 1  =  αk corresponding to the added node (i0,j0), we get Nskw. [formula] As a Corollary of this Lemma 3 and Proposition 1 we have Proposition 2. The normalized functions [formula] are determined by the cocycle condition

[formula]

with the initial condition [formula].

Examples 1. For the partitions (0),(1),(2),(1,1),(2,1) and (2,2), the corresponding normalized functions [formula] are given as follows.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and for the partition (2,2), we have

[formula]

It is interesting to note the relations

[formula]

[formula]

Each of the equations plays a fundamental role in the proof of Theorems 1 or 2 respectively.

The determinant formulas

For integers p  ≥  1 and q  ≥  0, put

[formula]

where βj ( - q + 1  ≤  j  ≤  p - 1) is given by

[formula]

Lemma 4. Put [formula], which corresponds to the hook diagram wp,q(Λ0)  ↔  λ = ({p},{q}), then

[formula]

Proof. For p = 1 and q = 0, the formula is trivially satisfied, X1,0 = f0. We need to check the following relations for p  ≥  1 and q  ≥  0.

[formula]

Let us prove the first one. By definition

[formula]

expanding this with respect to the last row, we have

[formula]

which is nothing but

[formula]

Thus the first relation is proved. The second one is similar.[formula] Using the notations above, we can state our main result as follows. Theorem 1. For any w∈W, the normalized function [formula] is given by the following determinant

[formula]

where (I,J) is the Frobenius symbol of λ = Y corresponding to w(Λ0). Equivalently, we also have the following Jacobi-Trudi type ([\cite=ma]) formulas Theorem 2. For any w∈W, the normalized function [formula] is given by the following determinant

[formula]

where λ is the partition corresponds to w(Λ0) and [formula] is the normalized function for the single row λ = (k). The proofs of these theorems are given in the next section. Corollary. For any w∈W, the function φw(Λ0) is a polynomial in α and f with integral coefficients. The leading term with respect to f is [formula], where νi is the number of nodes with color i in Y  ↔  w(Λ0). Proof. We will prove by induction on the length of w∈W. [formula] is in [formula]. Assume that [formula]. By Proposition 1, the function S(α;f) = φsiw(Λ0) for mi = 1 is given by

[formula]

which belongs to [formula]. The condition on the leading term of S follows from that on R. On the other hand, from Theorem 1, we see that [formula] is a polynomial in f, hence the function S(α;f) also belongs to [formula]. [formula]

Proof of the Theorems

Lemma 5. We have

[formula]

Proof. Let ei, (0  ≤  i  ≤  n) be a basis in [formula]. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, put

[formula]

[formula]

Then the both hand sides of the identity are the coefficients of [formula] in

[formula]

It is easy to see that these two are the same and equal to

[formula]

[formula] Proof of the Theorem 1. To prove the theorem, it is enough to check that the determinant satisfy the transformation properties in Proposition 2.

For the actions of si, i  ≠  0, the transformation properties directly follows from eq.(3) for the hook Xp,q in Lemma 4, since the si acts only on the single row (i > 0) or single column (i < 0).

For the s0 action, we need some computation because in this case the size of the determinant changes. For w(Λ0)  ↔  (I,J) such that m0 = 1, we have [formula]. Then

[formula]

We shall prove that this is equal to [formula].

As is shown in eq.(1), we have

[formula]

Applying the actions sk, k  ≥  2 or k  ≤   - 2 repeatedly, one get

[formula]

for any p  ≥  2 and q  ≥  1. By using this and [formula], we get

[formula]

and this is indeed equal to [formula], because of the identity in Lemma 5. [formula]

Proof of the Theorem 2. The proof for the general [formula] cases can be reduced to the single column cases by the action of sk, (k > 0) which preserves the size of the determinant.

For the single column case λ = (1q + 1), the desired formula is

[formula]

The case of q = 1 follows from the relation in eq.(2). More generaly, we have

[formula]

To prove the case q > 1, we will check the condition in Proposition 2,

[formula]

Using the eq.(5), the left hand side of this relation (6) can be written as the same determinant as [formula] in (4), with the first row h( - q)i replaced by h'( - q)i such as

[formula]

Then the left hand side of the eq.(6) is equal to the right hand side

[formula]

because of the identity

[formula]

[formula]

Remarks

Remark 1. The reduction to the finite rank cases A(1)N - 1 is given by the N-reduced condition "πN = 1". On the variables α,f,τ, this reduction is simply realized by the specialization

[formula]

By putting [formula], [formula], the representation W(A∞) reduces to that of W = W(A(1)N - 1) on the field [formula]. The τ-functions for A(1)N - 1 case is nothing but the specialization of τ for A∞ and have the same determinant formulas. Note that only the N-reduced Young diagrams can be generated by the actions of [formula].

Remark 2. The determinant formulas of the τ-function provide explicit solutions for initial value problem of the associated discrete dynamical system introduced in [\cite=affine]. The polynomiality of the τ-functions and the multiplicative formula of f-variables in terms of the τ-functions

[formula]

give a strong support for the singularity confinement property which the discrete dynamical system expected to have.

Remark 3. The representation of affine Weyl groups W(A(1)l) has an interpretation as the Bäcklund transformations for the Painlevé equations PIV (for l = 2), PV (for l = 3) and their generalizations for l  ≥  4 [\cite=higher]. Under this interpretation, the polynomials φw(Λj) are the far-reaching generalization of the "special polynomials" arising in Painlevé equations in the sense of Umemura et. al. [\cite=Um1][\cite=Um2]. When specialized to certain "initial solutions", we obtain explicit determinant formulas for the Okamoto polynomials (for PIV [\cite=PIV]), the Umemura polynomials (for PV [\cite=PV]) and their generalizations.

Remark 4. The normalized functions [formula] can be represented as the minor determinants of the following frame X of the universal Grassmann manifold,

[formula]

Where [formula]. In this picture, the Weyl group W is nothing but the Weyl group W(GL∞). It would be interesting if the space of the initial values of Painlevé equations can be realized as a natural sub-manifolds of the universal Grassmann manifold.
