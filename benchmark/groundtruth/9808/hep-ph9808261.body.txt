Pattern of neutrino masses and mixing as suggested by the present experimental evidences and hints seem quite different from the one in the quark sector. The oscillations of [formula] of the atmospheric origin require large [formula] mixing and very small difference ΔA  ~  10- 3  eV2 in their squared masses [\cite=superk]. The solar neutrino anomalies require [\cite=bks] much smaller mass scale ΔS  ~  10- 6  eV2 (MSW [\cite=msw] conversion) or ΔS  ~  10- 10  eV2 (vacuum oscillations [\cite=vac]). The latter alternative can reconcile the solar anomaly only if mixing involving νe is large.

The conventional seesaw models based on grand unified theories link the masses and mixing of leptons to that in the quark sector [\cite=pm]. This link does not seem to be fully supported by the experiments and one must either admit variety of textures [\cite=bh] [\cite=text] in right handed neutrino masses or look for some alternative [\cite=alt] schemes.

The presently available information on the solar neutrinos do not seem to choose unambiguously [\cite=bks] between the MSW or the vacuum oscillation solutions although the MSW conversion with large angle seems to be highly disfavored [\cite=bks] by the recent [\cite=dayn] day night asymmetry measurements at SuperKamioka. Thus the MSW mechanism requires small mixing of νe. It is then intriguing why large mixing is preferred in the [formula] system with less hierarchical ΔA. The vacuum solution seems more natural from the point of view of this theoretical prejudice but in this case one has a problem of accounting for very large hierarchy [formula]. This note is devoted to discussion of these issues.

Let us suppose that both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino oscillations are described by maximal (~  π / 4) mixing among relevant states. This hypothesis is shown [\cite=bim] to lead through unitarity to a unique structure for the mixing matrix U given by:

[formula]

where, [formula] This structure can describe the solar and atmospheric neutrino observations successfully if [formula] and [formula]. It also implies that νe does not oscillate at the atmospheric scale in accordance with the findings at SuperKamioka. This U together with neutrino masses can be used to determine the structure of the light neutrino mass matrix in basis with diagonal charged lepton masses. This was done [\cite=bim] in case of the hierarchical masses. Since large mixing may be intimately related to pseudo-Dirac structure, let us suppose that a pair of neutrinos are (almost) degenerate with masses m0 and -m0. This common mass may be identified with the atmospheric neutrino scale. For a fixed U as given in eq.([\ref=u]), one has three physically distinct possibilities corresponding to mi (i=1,2,3) values

[formula]

This implies the following neutrino mass matrices [formula] for the three light states:

[formula]

[formula]

Of these, the texture in (a) seems more interesting as it does not presuppose any relations among matrix elements of [formula]. Moreover, this texture follows from a simple [formula] symmetry. Conversely, bimaximal mixing may be regarded [\cite=bh] as a consequence of the [formula] symmetry imposed in the leptonic sector [\cite=note]. One still needs to understand the origin of m0 and of much smaller splitting ΔS between (almost) degenerate pair. The splitting may arise due to small breaking of the [formula] symmetry. This can be parameterized [\cite=bh] in terms of a small parameter ε leading to

[formula]

where different entries are meant to denote the order of magnitudes of the breaking term. This leads to

[formula]

When m0 is identified with the atmospheric scale (~  .03  eV), the above equation implies

[formula]

What could be the origin of such small values for m0 and ε ? It is indeed possible to link these scales to the hierarchies among the known scales namely Mweak,MH  ~  MGUT and MPlanck.

Let us consider the standard SU(2)  ×  U(1) model without addition of any right handed neutrinos. Neutrino masses are generated through the following Yukawa couplings when an SU(2)-triplet Higgs field is introduced:

[formula]

Here Δ refers to the 2  ×  2 matrix for the triplet Higgs field. We have suppressed the Lorentz indices in the above equation. i,j refer to the generation indices. We also impose the [formula] symmetry. Non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev) for the neutral component of Δ then leads to structure as in eq.([\ref=textures]a) with,

[formula]

θ could be naturally large for f12  ~  f13. The smallness of m0 may appear unnatural in SU(2)  ×  U(1) theory. But small triplet vev and hence m0 may result if theory contains heavy scales such as MGUT. This follows from the induced vev mechanism which implies [\cite=pm] [\cite=ms]:

[formula]

MH  ~  1015  GeV then leads to the required value m0  ~  10- 2  eV.

The symmetry [formula] must be regarded as a global symmetry in the present context since it is not possible to gauge this symmetry in standard model (SM) without introducing right handed neutrinos. Such global symmetries are known to be unstable against gravitational effects  [\cite=gre1] [\cite=gre2] and would be broken. We assume that this breaking is manifested in the low energy theory through higher dimensional operators suppressed by the Planck mass MP. One could write the following symmetry breaking non-renormalizable terms:

[formula]

Here we have introduced SU(2)  ×  U(1) singlet field η which is assumed to obtain large ~  MH vev. φ0 (Δ0) corresponds to the neutral component of the SU(2)  ×  U(1) doublet ( triplet ) Higgs field. The dimensionless couplings βmij    (m = 1,2,3) break the [formula] symmetry.

The operator O1 is the familiar one introduced for example in [\cite=azs]. The above operators lead to the ε parameters in eq.([\ref=eps]) and hence to the splitting among the degenerate pair. One respectively gets for the operators O1 - O3

[formula]

where (Δm2)i denote splitting of the degenerate states induced by Oi. Here we have assumed that parameters f in eq.([\ref=numass]) are of O(1) and identified f  <  Δ0  >    ~    <  Δ0 >  = m0.

The operator O1 gives a splitting which is somewhat larger (smaller) than the scale needed for the vacuum (MSW) solution to the solar neutrino problem. The second and the third operators can generate scales relevant for the MSW and the vacuum solutions respectively if the vev for η is at or near the grand unification scale. While MSW is a natural and appealing solution to the solar neutrino problem, it cannot be implemented in the present context for two reasons. Firstly, the large angle solution obtained here from the [formula] symmetry seems to be disfavored experimentally as already mentioned. More importantly, the said symmetry implies a mixing angle of π / 4 degree for which the matter effects do not occur. The corrections to this mixing angle induced due to ε are too small to change it appreciably [\cite=bh]. Thus in spite of the possibility of generating the MSW scale naturally, vacuum solution is to be preferred in the present context. This solution can be realized easily in a simple model to which we now turn.

We extend the SM by adding two additional Higgs fields namely, an SU(2)-triplet Δ and a singlet η. In addition, we impose [formula] and a Z3 symmetry with the charge assignment (1, - 1,1,1) for the fields (uc,dc,φ,η). Rest of the fields are assumed to carry zero charge under Z3. All the scalar fields are also assumed to be neutral under [formula]. The Yukawa couplings in eq.([\ref=numass]) generate the required [formula] symmetric mass matrix. The smallness of Δ0 arises as follows. Consider the following scalar potential containing a heavy ~  MGUT and the electroweak scale:

[formula]

The terms not explicitly written in the above equations correspond to some of the quartic terms involving Δ and crossed quartic terms [\cite=f1] for the doublet field. We assume that all the mass scales except the one (namely μ2) associated with the SU(2) doublet field in the above equations are large, i.e. ~  MGUT. For M2η negative, the vev for η is driven to a large scale while Δ0 vev can be small for MΔ2 > 0. Minimization of eq.([\ref=pot]) gives,

[formula]

where, [formula]. The choice MH  ~  MΔ  ~  1015  GeV leads to <  Δ0  >    ~  10- 2  eV very close to the atmospheric mass scale m0  ~  .03  eV.

The above scalar potential has a global symmetry under which Δ and η carry opposite charges. This symmetry is spontaneously broken and the potential leads to a Goldstone boson which can be identified with the majoron. The above potential in fact coincides formally with the one in the triplet plus singlet majoron model [\cite=tm]. The majoron arising in this example remains invisible and is phenomenologically consistent.

The structure of the [formula] breaking higher dimensional operator induced by gravitational effect is governed by the gauge symmetries of the model. It was realized that this is true even if the gauge symmetry of the low energy world is a discrete [\cite=wk] one. The gauged discrete symmetries may arise in the low energy theory as a remnant of some continuous gauge symmetries if the Higgs fields responsible for its breaking are invariant under a discrete sub group. Such discrete symmetries are then required to satisfy the discrete anomaly constraints [\cite=ir]. These constraints derived in [\cite=ir] are given for ZN group as:

[formula]

where, δ = 0    (1) for N odd (even). The corresponding anomalies involving U(1) factors do not impose any significant restrictions on the low energy theory [\cite=ir]. It is easily verified that the discrete Z3 imposed here indeed satisfies these constraints with p3 = p2 = 0,m =  - 1 in case of the three fermionic generations. This symmetry may then be imposed as an additional constraint in deciding the structure of the allowed higher dimensional terms. One sees that of the three operators in eq.([\ref=hdo]) only dimension six operator is invariant under the Z3. As mentioned in eq.([\ref=spliting]), this operator can lead to the right splitting between the degenerate pairs to account for the solar neutrino deficit through vacuum oscillations. It is indeed remarkable that one could relate both the solar and the atmospheric scales to the other known scales this way.

The imposition of a discrete symmetry above is somewhat ad-hoc and may be dispensed with if the coefficient β1,2 associated with dimension five terms are small instead of being O(1). Specifically, one requires β1  ~  10- 3  ,β2  ~  10- 4 in eq.({[\ref=spliting]) in order to account for the vacuum value for ΔS. This suppression need not be as unnatural as it may look. A familiar example of such suppression [\cite=gre2] [\cite=sup] is provided in case of the breaking of the PQ symmetry [\cite=axion] induced by the wormhole effects [\cite=gre1]. It is found that if the global symmetry in question is spontaneously broken at a scale f then coefficients characterizing its gravitational breaking are suppressed by the wormhole action. Such suppression is typically expected [\cite=sup] to be [formula]. Thus in our case, spontaneous breaking of the Le - Lμ - Lτ symmetry around the GUT scale may account for the required suppression in β1,2.

We have restricted ourselves so far to the SM. Many of the present considerations can be generalized to the SU(5) model with some modifications. The triplet Δ may be part of a 15 dimensional representation (denoted by the same symbol) of SU(5) and the role of the singlet field may be played by the adjoint (A) representation used for breaking the SU(5) symmetry. A straightforward generalization of the [formula] symmetry would be to assume a family dependent U(1) symmetry and assign charges (1,-1,-1) respectively to three generations of the [formula]-plet of fermions leaving rest of the fields neutral under it. The couplings [formula] then lead to the neutrino masses as in eq.([\ref=numass]) if the triplet component of the 15-plet has a small vev. Such vev could follow [\cite=pm] from a term in the scalar potential coupling the 5-dimensional Higgs field [formula] to Δ

[formula]

where, a,b refer to the SU(5) indices. This term is analogous to the last term in eq.([\ref=pot]). As in that case, the vevs for the doublet component of [formula] and the adjoint field induce a vev for the triplet in 15.

The splitting among neutrinos is accounted for by the following dim 5 operators:

[formula]

These are analogous to operators O1,2 in eq.([\ref=hdo]) and can account for the vacuum oscillation scale provided the coefficients β1,2 are suppressed.

In the exact U(1) symmetric limit, the down quarks remain massless while the mass matrix for the up-quark is not restricted by the imposed U(1) symmetry. The former can obtain masses from the U(1) breaking terms. These are characterized by the following dimension five operators

[formula]

The adjoint field will acquire a vev at the grand unification scale

[formula]

where MX is mass of the SU(5) gauge Boson. For MX  ~  1016 the above operator leads to a contribution of ≤   O(0.1 GeV) which is right for the description of the strange quark mass but falls short of the value of the b quark mass.

Let us consider an alternative possibility in which one assigns non-trivial U(1)-charges also to Higgs fields and the 10-plets of fermions. Take as an example the U(1) assignment (0, - 1 / 3, - 1 / 3) for three 10-plets. The [formula] of Higgs field [formula] and the adjoint are assumed respectively to carry the charges - 2 / 3 and 4 / 3. The [formula] charge is specifically chosen to obtain the right structure for the quark masses. The charge for A is fixed by requiring that the term in eq.([\ref=su5]) be allowed by the U(1). One now obtains the following mass matrices for the up and down quarks in the absence of the gravitational breaking of the symmetry:

[formula]

where m1,2' (m1,2,3) are parameters determining down (up-quark) masses. It is seen that the b,c and t quarks acquire masses at this stage. The higher dimensional terms displayed in eq.([\ref=down]) can now account for the strange and down quark masses. Similarly, one could write dimension 5 operator analogous to eq.([\ref=down]) giving mass to the up-quark. Thus a large part of quark masses and mixings may actually be due to the gravitational breaking of the U(1) symmetry. This symmetry is however not strong enough to make definitive predictions on theses masses and mixings.

The symmetry U(1) does not remain exact in the last example but is spontaneously broken around the GUT scale. This may be a welcome feature as such breaking can possibly account for suppression [\cite=sup] in the magnitudes of the coefficient β1,2 of the higher dimensional term.

In summary, we have underlined the role that the Le - Lμ - Lτ symmetry can play in generating leptonic mixing structure desired on experimental grounds. The presence of a heavy scale MH in theory then accounts for the atmospheric mass scale. Planck scale suppressed breaking of the symmetry seems to be in the correct range to provide a solution to the solar anomaly as well. The role such breaking can play in generation of neutrino masses has been emphasized previously [\cite=azs]. Here we have shown that the Planck scale alongwith Mweak and a MH  ~  MGUT can account for all the observed features of the solar and atmospheric anomalies provided neutrino mass structure is approximately Le - Lμ - Lτ symmetric.
