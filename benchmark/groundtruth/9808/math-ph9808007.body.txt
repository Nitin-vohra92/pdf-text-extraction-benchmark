Generalized Weierstrass representation for surfaces and Lax-Phillips scattering theory for automorphic functions

It is well-known that Poincare plane Π, i.e., the upperhalf plane

[formula]

be the model of Lobachevsky geometry, where the role of motion group played the group G = SL(2,) of fractional linear transformations

[formula]

where a,b,c,d∈,  ad - bc = 1.

The group SL(2,) has a great number of so-called discrete subgroups. The sugroup Γ is called discrete if the identical transformation is isolate from the other transformations γ∈Γ. For example, a modular group consisting of transformations with integer a,b,c,d is discrete subgroup. Further, a fundamental domain F of discrete subgroup Γ be an any domain on Poincare plane such that the every point of Π may be transfered into a closing [formula] of domain F by means of some transformation γ∈Γ, at the same time no there exists the point from F which transfered to the other point of F by such transformation. The function f defined on Π is called automorphic with reference to discrete subgroup Γ if

Further, generalized Weierstrass representation for surfaces was proposed by Konopelchenko in 1993 [\cite=1] [\cite=2] is defined by the following formulae

[formula]

where ε is arbitrary curve in [formula], ψ and φ are complex-valued functions on variables z,∈ satisfying to the linear system (two-dimensional Dirac equation):

[formula]

where U(z,) is a real-valued function. If to interpret the functions Xi(z,) as coordinates in a space 3,0, then the formulae ([\ref=e2]), ([\ref=e3]) define a conformal immersion of surface into 3,0 with induced metric

[formula]

at this the Gaussian and mean curvature are

[formula]

Let us consider a closed surface with genus > 1, and let F:Σ  →  3,0 be an immersion of surface with genus > 1 given by ([\ref=e2])-([\ref=e3]). It is well-known that every closed oriented surface Σ with positive genus is uniformizable:

[formula]

where a surface M is conformal covering. Hence it immediately follows that a factor-space M / Γ is conformally equivalent to the surface Σ, where Γ is a discrete subgroup of a group of isometries of M. In our case a space M is isometric to the Poincare plane Π. The group of isometries of Π is the group G = SL(2,), the transformations of which are defined by ([\ref=e1]).

According to [\cite=3] (Proposition 4) we have that a surface Σ with genus > 1 immersing into 3,0 by formulas ([\ref=e2])-([\ref=e3]) is conformally equivalent to a surface Π  /  Γ, where Γ is a discrete subgroup of SL(2,). The functions ψ and φ, the metric tensor D(z)2 and potential U(z), are transformed by elements of Γ as follows

[formula]

Hence it immediately follows from ([\ref=e4]) that

[formula]

Therefore, the mean curvature is automorphic function.

Further, follows to [\cite=4] let us consider the discrete subgroup Γ  ⊂  SL(2,) satisfying to the following requirements:

The fundamental domain FΓ = F for the group Γ choosing as follows

In Hilbert space L2(F,dμ), where dμ = y- 2dxdy is a measure, consider a symmetric operator L defined by the differential expression

[formula]

on all sufficiently smooth and uniformly restricted in F the functions H, which satisfying to automorphity condition ([\ref=e5]). A spectrum of the operator L consists of finite set of own values: [formula] (this own number corresponds to the unit representation of group SL(2,)), the numbers [formula] are belong to ([formula]) (additional series), the set of positive own values [formula] (basic series), and the branch of absolutely continuous spectrum λ = k2 on

U(z,t)=VU(z,0).
