Performance of the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation for CDM models in arbitrary FLRW cosmologies

Introduction

The Zel'dovich approximation (Zel'dovich, 1970) is known to be accurate even in the weakly non-linear regime of the structure formation. However, when the shell-crossing occurs, the validity of the approximation breaks down. Coles, Melott & Shandrin (1993) introduced a truncated Zel'dovich approximation by smoothing the small-scale power in the initial conditions to remove the unwanted non-linearity. Optimization of the smoothing schemes, the filter shapes and filter scales, and the performance of the approximation have been investigated by authors (Melott, Pellman & Shandrin, 1994, Melott, Buchert & Weiß, 1995). They found that the truncated Zel'dovich approximation does not provide a correct description of the internal structure and mass distribution of non-linear structures like galaxy clusters, but it is accurate in locating their positions and thus reliably describes their spatial distribution. Therefore, the truncated Zel'dovich approximation is a powerful tool to study the large-scale distribution of galaxy clusters which provides important constraints on models of cosmic structure formation (see e.g. Borgani et al., 1995).

From a theoretical point of view, very recently, Takada & Futamase (1998) developed a formalism which allows one to investigate a relation between the large-scale quasi non-linear dynamics and the small-scale non-linear dynamics within using an averaging method in the Lagrangian perturbation theory. They found that the small-scale dynamics only weakly affects the large-scale structure formation and thus the truncated Lagrangian perturbation theory is a good approximation to investigate the large-scale structure formation.

The second-order correction to the truncated Zel'dovich approximation was introduced by Melott (1994), and Melott et al. (1995). They found that the second-order correction improves the performance of the approximation. In their study, Weiß et al. (1996) optimized the performance of the truncated second-order Zel'dovich approximation in the Einstein-de Sitter cosmology. They performed N-body simulations of the cold dark matter (CDM) and broken scale invariance models, and compared the results with those obtained from the optimized approximation scheme. They found an excellent performance of the optimized approximation down to scales close to the correlation length. However, since the optimization was performed only in the Einstein-de Sitter cosmology, it was not clear whether the same optimized scheme would perform as excellent in arbitrary Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies. Since the optimized approximation is a powerful tool to investigate the formation of large-scale structures, it is worth while generalizing the optimized scheme of the approximation to arbitrary FLRW cosmologies.

The main purpose of this paper is to test the performance of the optimized second-order Zel'dovich approximation obtained by Weiß et al. (1996) (hereafter, optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation) in arbitrary FLRW cosmologies. We examine three CDM models, two flat models with Ω0 = 1 (SCDM) and with Ω0 = 0.3 (ΛCDM) and an open model with Ω0 = 0.3 (OCDM). From the results of the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation, we calculate the two-point correlation functions. We do not perform the N-body simulation, but we compare the correlation functions with those predicted by a parameterized fitting formula that Peacock & Dodds (1996) use to predict the power spectrum of the non-linear mass density field. We refer the reader to the above reference for details of the formula and its implementation. In their recent paper, Jenkins et al. (1998) compared the two-point correlation functions obtained from their very large N-body simulations with that predicted by fitting formula by Peacock & Dodds (1996) and found a good agreement between them over a scales between ~  0.1h- 1Mpc and ~  10h- 1Mpc.

The plan of this paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief summary of the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation. The performance of the approximation in arbitrary FLRW cosmologies is tested in section 3. Our paper concludes in section 4 with discussions.

Throughout this paper, we use a unit for which c = 1, and the scale factor a is normalized to unity at the present epoch, i.e., a0 = 1. The Hubble parameter H, density parameter Ω and normalized cosmological constant λ are defined in the usual manner. Quantities of the present epoch and initial epoch are indicated by indices 0 and i, respectively.

Summary of the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation

The Zel'dovich and Post-Zel'dovich approximation are regarded as subclasses of the first order and second order solution of the Lagrangian perturbation theory, respectively (Buchert, 1989, 1992). Since the Lagrangian perturbation theory has been thoroughly investigated by various authors (e.g., Buchert & Ehlers, 1993, Buchert, 1994, Bouchet et al., 1995, Sasaki & Kasai, 1998), here we describe only the aspects which are directly relevant to this paper.

Denoting the comoving Eulerian coordinates by [formula], and Lagrangian coordinates by [formula], the field of trajectories [formula] up to the Post-Zel'dovich order is

[formula]

with the time-dependent coefficients expressed in terms of the linear growth rate D+(a) (Peebles, 1980)

[formula]

[formula]

where H(a) is the Hubble parameter, [formula]. In the above expressions, we only take the fastest growing mode for each order. It is important to note that the relation between D(a) and E(a), E(a) / D2(a), is remarkably insensitive to the background cosmologies (Bouchet et al., 1992, 1996). The displacement potentials are obtained by solving iteratively two Poisson equations;

[formula]

[formula]

where δi is an initial density contrast field.

Next, we review the optimization scheme proposed by Weiß et al. (1996), which we adopt in this paper. The high frequency part of the Fourier transform of an initial density field is smoothed out by a Gaussian k-space filter with a characteristic smoothing scale kgs,

[formula]

i.e., P(k)  →  P(k)W2(k), where P(k) is the power spectrum of the initial density field. Weiß et al. (1996) found that an optimal value of kgs does not significantly depend on the form of P(k), and is related to a scale of non-lineality knl by kgs  ~  1.2knl with a little scatter. The quantity knl is defined by

[formula]

We adopt the recommended value of kgs  =  1.2knl.

Models and results

We examine three CDM models. Table 1 lists the models and gives their parameters. We use the CDM transfer function in Bardeen et al. (1986), with the scale invariant (n = 1) primordial power spectrum. The shape parameter, Γ, in the spectrum defined by Sugiyama (1995), which we adopt, is

[formula]

where Ωb is the baryonic matter density parameter, and h is the normalized Hubble constant, i.e., H0  =  100hkm/sec/Mpc. In all cases, the amplitude of primordial fluctuation is set such that the models reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters of the present day. We adopt the values of σ8 recommended by Eke, Cole & Frenk, (1996).

The initial density field is set on 1283 grid points for a cubic box of L = 128  ×  Δxh- 1Mpc a side, with a periodic boundary condition, where Δx is the grid spacing. Here we use Bertschinger's software COSMICS (Bertschinger, 1995) with some modifications according to the shape parameter ([\ref=Gamma]), and smoothing of the power spectrum of the initial density field with the Gaussian filter ([\ref=wgs]). In order to ensure the condition δi  ≪  1, which is required for deriving eq. ([\ref=pois1]), the initial condition is set at a redshift zi  =  103. We solve the Poisson equations ([\ref=pois1]) and ([\ref=PZAspa]) via Fast Fourier Transformation. Then we move 1283 particles having the initial Lagrangian coordinate on the grid, according to the Post-Zel'dovich approximation, eq. ([\ref=PZAform]). Here, for the linear growth factor D+(a), we use the fitting formula of Carrol, Press & Turner (1992), and the Post-Zel'dovich order's growth rate E(a) is evaluated by numerical integrations.

We consider three cases of the boxsize. The grid spacings and particle masses are summarized in Table 2. The redshifts of realizations are chosen to be z = 0, 1 and 2, and the scales of non-linearity, knl, for each redshift for each model are presented in Table 3.

From the results of the realizations, we evaluate the two-point correlation function of the particles by adopting the direct estimator (Hockney & Eastwood, 1988),

[formula]

where Np is the number of pairs of particles with separations between r - Δ / 2 and r + Δ / 2, δV is the volume of this shell and Nc is the number of particles taken as centers. The results are plotted in Figure 1.

It can be shown in Figure 1a that our results for SCDM model, of course, agree well with that obtained by Weiß et al. (1996) (see Figure 7 of their paper). It can be also shown in Figure 1b and 1c that the comparable performance of the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation is also achieved in both OCDM and ΛCDM models. In all cases, the correlation functions obtained from the approximation are accurate down to the scales where the non-linear correlation functions represent their non-linear behavior, and below those scales they are depressed. Meanwhile the correlation length itself is underestimated only slightly by less than 1h- 1Mpc (this point has been also pointed out by Weiß et al. 1996). For the high redshift realization cases, the correlation functions agree well with those predicted by the linear theory down to very close to the correlation length.

Discussions

In the last section, we found that the optimized Post-Zel'dovivh approximation by Weiß et al. (1996) performs excellently not only in SCDM model but also in both OCDM and ΛCDM models. This is, apriori, not clear because in Weiß et al. (1996) the optimization was performed only in the Einstein-de Sitter background cosmology.

The universality of the excellent performance of the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation may be explained as follows. The smoothing scale kgs is chosen to be related to the scale of non-linearity knl, and knl is determined by the integral of the linearly evolved power spectrum of the initial density field, eq. ([\ref=knl]), i.e., the power spectrum evolves as [formula]. On the other hand, the Post-Zel'dovich order's displacement is evolved according to E(a) and the unwanted non-linearity in the initial data is removed by the Gaussian filter with the smoothing scale kgs. Thus, knl relates to D2(a), and kgs relates to E(a). Therefore, an optimized relation between kgs and knl is determined by the relation between D2(a) and E(a). As was pointed out by Bouchet et al. (1992) and (1996), E(a) / D2(a) is very insensitive to the cosmologies. Therefore, once an optimized relation between kgs and knl is found in a background cosmology, it is also optimized in arbitrary background cosmologies. We should also note that although we dealt only with the CDM model, it has been found that the optimized relation between kgs and knl is insensitive to shapes of the power spectrum (Melott et al., 1994, 1995, Weiß et al., 1996).

From a computational point of view, the optimized Post-Zel'dovich approximation is very time-efficient; this enables us to compute many independent models within a reasonable CPU time. Although, the approximation can not provide a correct description of the internal structure of non-linear structures, it describes their spatial distribution well (Weiß et al., 1996). As was shown in the last section, two-point correlation functions are accurate down to the scale close to the correlation length. Therefore the approximation is a powerful tool to study the formation of large-scale structure on scales above the correlation length, such as the analysis of the cluster distribution (Borgani et al., 1995). It is also appropriate for the study of the gravitational lensing by the large-scale structures (Bertelmann & Schneider, 1991).

Before closing this paper, we propose to use the Post-Zel'dovich approximation for setting an initial condition of N-body simulations. The Post-Zel'dovich order's solutions can be easily obtained from the Zel'dovich solutions, eqs. ([\ref=PZAtime]) and ([\ref=PZAspa]). Thus, the Post-Zel'dovich approximation is as easy to implement as the Zel'dovich approximation. Therefore, one who adopts the Zel'dovich approximation to set the initial condition can easily include the Post-Zel'dovich correction, which will improve the accuracy of the simulations.
