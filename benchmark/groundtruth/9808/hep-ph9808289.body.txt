Abstract

We present a model-independent analysis of [formula] and [formula] decays, including K  →  3π unitarity corrections and a general decomposition of the dispersive amplitude. From the existing data on K+  →  π+e+e- we predict the ratio R = B(K+  →  π+μ+μ-) / B(K+  →  π+e+e-) to be larger than 0.23, in slight disagreement with the recent measurement R  =  0.167  ±  0.036. Consequences for the K±  →  π±e+e- charge asymmetries and for the KL  →  π0e+e- mode are also discussed.

Introduction

Radiative nonleptonic kaon decays continue to provide interesting information on the structure of the weak interactions at low energies. Among them, the flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) transitions [formula], induced at the one-loop level in the Standard Model, are well suited to explore its quantum structure and, possibly, its extensions [\cite=EPR1] [\cite=DEIN]. On the experimental side, the high-precision measurements already achieved at Brookhaven (AGS) [\cite=AGS98] and Fermilab (KTeV) [\cite=KTEV98], and foreseen in the near future at Frascati (KLOE) [\cite=DPHB], call for a thorough theoretical investigation.

The [formula] and [formula] ([formula]) channels, expected to be dominated by long-distance dynamics through one-photon exchange (K  →  πγ*), were studied at leading order in the chiral expansion in Ref. [\cite=EPR1]. Once the unknown combination of local terms arising in this framework is fixed by comparison with K+  →  π+e+e- data [\cite=AL92], the process K+  →  π+μ+μ- can be predicted without further assumptions. Recently, this last mode has been observed [\cite=AD97], yielding a value for R = Γ(K+  →  π+μ+μ-)  /  Γ(K+  →  π+e+e-) that is ~  2  σ below the leading-order prediction. This experimental result has motivated the present study of K  →  πγ* form factors beyond the leading order in the chiral expansion. We have carried out this program by including unitarity corrections from K  →  πππ together with the most general polynomial structure consistent with the chiral expansion up to O(p6). In this way we perform a model-independent analysis of the existing [formula] data leading to a consistent fit of both rate and dilepton invariant-mass spectrum of the electron channel. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the persisting discrepancy in the ratio R cannot be accommodated in the Standard Model.

Besides this phenomenological analysis, we present a general discussion of theoretical predictions for the polynomial part of the K+(KS)  →  π+(π0)γ* form factors. We show that it is very difficult at present to estimate the branching ratios of the [formula] modes without strong model-dependent assumptions. More accessible are the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum and, correspondingly, the ratio Γ(KS  →  π0μ+μ-)  /  Γ(KS  →  π0e+e-).

We conclude our analysis by discussing the impact of the long-distance K  →  πγ*  →  πe+e- transitions for estimating CP-violating observables. In particular, we analyse the possibilities for disentangling direct and indirect CP-violating components of the KL  →  π0e+e- amplitude. Moreover, we estimate the effect of the unitarity corrections on the charge asymmetry of K±  →  π±e+e- decays.

The plan of the paper is the following: in the next section we present the model-independent analysis of [formula] transitions. Section [\ref=sect:insights] is devoted to explore the physics behind the polynomial coefficients of the K  →  πγ* form factors. We turn to a discussion of CP-violating observables in Sect. [\ref=sect:CPV]. Our main conclusions are summarized in the last section.

Model-independent analysis

2.1

The FCNC transitions [formula] ([formula]) are dominated by single virtual photon exchange ([formula]) if allowed by CP symmetry. This is the case for K+ and KS decays where the amplitude is determined by an electromagnetic transition form factor in the presence of the nonleptonic weak interactions:

[formula]

[formula]

where LΔS = 1 is the strangeness changing nonleptonic weak Lagrangian and Jμelm is the electromagnetic current. The dynamics of the decays is completely specified by the invariant functions W+(z) and WS(z). As dictated by gauge invariance, these functions vanish to lowest order in the low-energy expansion [\cite=EPR1]. To account for this chiral suppression we have pulled out a factor 1 / (4π)2 in the definition ([\ref=eq:tff]). Since the Cabibbo angle is approximately compensated by the nonleptonic octet enhancement, the natural magnitude of W(z) is expected to be GFM2K.

With these conventions the decay amplitude takes the form

[formula]

The spectrum in the dilepton invariant mass is then given by

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula].

2.2

The form factors Wi(z) (i =  + ,S) are analytic functions in the complex z-plane cut along the positive real axis. The cut starts at z = 4r2π with the two-pion threshold. For the small dilepton masses occurring in the decays, one expects the π+π- intermediate state to play the dominant role in the dispersion relations for Wi(z). The contribution of higher-mass intermediate states can be described by a low-order polynomial in z. This is known to be a very good approximation for the K+K- contribution, for instance [\cite=EPR1].

We therefore decompose the form factors Wi(z) as

[formula]

where Wππi(z) denotes the contribution from the two-pion intermediate state. To leading nontrivial order in the chiral expansion [\cite=EPR1], the Wpoli(z) are constants (but for a negligible contribution due to the kaon loop). The functions Wππi(z) can be calculated from the diagram shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:loop], where the K  →  3π vertex is taken from the leading nonleptonic weak Lagrangian of O(p2).

Here we go one step further. We use the physical [formula] amplitude expanded up to O(p4) (as required by present [formula] data) and include the electromagnetic form factor F(z) (normalized to F(0) = 1) for π+π-  →  γ* to first nontrivial order. The relevant [formula] amplitudes are expanded as [\cite=DIPP]

[formula]

with

[formula]

where pi denote the pion momenta. To the same level of accuracy, the electromagnetic form factor is F(z)  =  1 + z / r2V with r2V  =  M2V / M2K≃2.5. In accordance with chiral counting, the polynomial in ([\ref=ffdecomp]) is assumed to have the general form

[formula]

Up to a linear polynomial of this type, the dispersion integral corresponding to Fig. [\ref=fig:loop] is unambiguously calculable with the result

[formula]

where z0 = 1 / 3 + r2π. The one-loop function

[formula]

[formula]

satisfies χ(0) = 0. In terms of the [formula] parameters in ([\ref=K3pi]), we find

[formula]

The total form factor, given by

[formula]

is expected to be an excellent approximation to the complete form factor of O(p6). The polynomial piece has the most general form that can occur to this order, with a priori unknown low-energy constants contributing to the ai, bi. The main assumption underlying the form factor ([\ref=eq:Wtot]) is that all other contributions to the dispersion integral except the two-pion intermediate state can be well approximated by a linear polynomial for small values of z.

Using the central values of the [formula] parameters [\cite=KMW2] in Table [\ref=tab:bi], we can now calculate the branching ratios for [formula] and [formula] in terms of the corresponding parameters:

[formula]

With a+ and aS expected to be of O(1), we observe that the amplitudes and branching ratios are actually dominated by the polynomial parts. Wππi(z) in ([\ref=eq:Wpp]) contributes to the rate mainly through its interference with ([\ref=eq:Wpol]). In fact, this really only applies to the K+ mode because the two-pion contribution is practically negligible for the neutral decay, due to the strong suppression of the KS  →  π+π-π0 amplitude.

2.3

In the Brookhaven experiment BNL-E777 [\cite=AL92] both spectrum and branching ratio of the decay K+  →  π+e+e- were measured. They fit a spectrum with two parameters C and λ defined through

[formula]

where Mee is the invariant mass of the lepton pair ([formula]), obtaining

[formula]

However, in order to subtract the background due to the process K+  →  π+π0, π0  →  e+e-γ, they make a cut in the dilepton invariant mass and consider only K+  →  π+e+e- events with Mee  >  0.150 GeV. Thus the branching ratio actually measured is given by

[formula]

and the result in ([\ref=eq:BRtt]) includes a theoretical extrapolation to the low Mee region.

The branching ratio ([\ref=eq:BRcut]) can be translated into allowed domains for the parameters a+ and b+ as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:abdomain]. For a generous range |b+|  ≤  2, two branches of solutions are in principle possible with opposite signs of a+.

Unlike the rate, the spectrum is very sensitive to b+. The bounds on b+ from the experimental spectrum are also indicated in Fig. [\ref=fig:abdomain]. Let us try to understand the allowed values of a+ and b+ with the help of the amplitude ([\ref=eq:Wtot]). The real part of the two-pion contribution, Wππ+(z), is a monotonically decreasing function of z in the physical region. Assuming first b+ = 0, as would be the case at O(p4) (except for the tiny contribution from the kaon loop), we infer that a+ must be negative to reproduce the experimentally observed positive slope ([\ref=eq:lambda]). In fact, the spectrum prefers a somewhat bigger slope requiring b+ / a+ > 0. This is made more explicit in Fig. [\ref=fig:Wplot1], where the theoretical spectrum (or rather the square of the form factor) is confronted with the experimental slope.

At O(p4) only negative values of a+ are allowed [\cite=AL92]. However, in general there can be a second branch of solutions with positive a+. Since in this case the slope is negative for b+ = 0, a sufficiently large b+ (b+ / a+ > 1) is necessary to reproduce the observed spectrum. Analogously to Fig. [\ref=fig:Wplot1], we exhibit the square of the form factor in Fig. [\ref=fig:Wplot2] for two sets of a+ and b+ corresponding to the ±  1σ values of the measured slope.

As we shall discuss in the next section, the second branch of solutions with positive a+ is disfavoured from a theoretical point of view. Indeed, naive chiral counting would suggest that the coefficient b+, which only arises at O(p6), should be smaller in magnitude than the leading coefficient a+.

For the present analysis we do not discard the second type of solutions right away but confront the theoretical amplitude with another piece of experimental information that has recently become available through the measurement of the muonic decay mode of K+. The Brookhaven experiment of Adler et al. [\cite=AD97] has measured a branching ratio

[formula]

which, together with the results from [\cite=AL92], implies a muon/electron ratio

[formula]

Can we use this experimental input to distinguish between the two branches in the a+ - b+ plane? Looking first at the solutions with a+ < 0, we find that R is a monotonically increasing function of |b+| for all allowed values in the left branch of Fig. [\ref=fig:abdomain] and it is therefore always bigger than 0.23 (obtained for b+ = 0). At first sight the second branch looks more promising for understanding the experimental result ([\ref=eq:Rexp]). In fact, for b+ = 0 the ratio R is small enough [\cite=EPR1] to agree with ([\ref=eq:Rexp]). However, as Fig. [\ref=fig:abdomain] shows, the experimental spectrum for the electronic decay channel requires b+ > a+. Since R is an increasing function of b+ for a+ > 0, the resulting values of R turn out to be even larger than in the previous case. Therefore, the theoretically unattractive solutions with positive a+ cannot explain the small μ / e ratio either. For the values of a+, b+ used in Figs. [\ref=fig:Wplot1], [\ref=fig:Wplot2] the results are collected in Table [\ref=tab:Rmue].

On the basis of this model-independent analysis, we conclude that the central values of the μ / e ratio [\cite=AD97] and the slope of the electron spectrum [\cite=AL92] together are not consistent. The ~  2σ discrepancy can be due to a statistical fluctuation or could be an indication of peculiar non-standard physics. We stress that the inconsistency is essentially unrelated to the chiral expansion but only depends on the assumption that both channels are dominated by the same K  →  πγ* form factor. Indeed, a form factor W+(z) rising with z as indicated by K+  →  π+e+e- data implies R > Rphase - space = 0.196 [\cite=EPR1].

Theoretical ideas on ai and bi

The leading O(p4) predictions of ai and bi are given by

[formula]

in terms of the usual parameters G8 and wi [\cite=EPR1]. Local contributions to the bi are forbidden at O(p4) and the small values in ([\ref=eq:asbs]) are generated by the expansion of the kaon-loop function. Sizable corrections to the bi are expected at O(p6) where local terms are allowed. However, since local terms contribute to the ai already at O(p4) (wi terms), naive chiral counting would suggest bi / ai  ~  O(p6) / O(p4)  <  1. The solution with both a+ and b+ negative discussed in the previous section satisfies this expectation.

The expressions of w+ and wS in terms of the O(p4) low-energy couplings Ni [\cite=EKW93], L9 [\cite=GL85] are

[formula]

Unfortunately, the values of the Nri are not known and to make definite predictions we need to rely on model-dependent assumptions. For this purpose, it is interesting to note that while the combinations of low-energy constants appearing in w+ and wS (or a+ and aS) depend separately on the renormalization scale μ, the combination occurring in a+  +  aS does not. As originally noted in [\cite=EPR1], this scale independence might be related to the structure of the effective four-fermion Hamiltonian relevant for [formula]. Indeed, as we will discuss in the next section, there is only one dimension-six operator giving a non-vanishing contribution to the ai at leading order: [formula]. Due to the octet structure of the [formula] current, this operator does not affect the combination a+  +  aS. Actually, the cancellation of this short-distance contribution holds not only for a+  +  aS but (in the limit of isospin conservation) for [formula] +   [formula] in general, that would thus be completely determined by low-energy dynamics. As a consequence, we find it more reliable to predict the sum rather than the separate expressions of Wpol+ and WpolS using a low-energy model. In the following we shall employ the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) hypothesis to estimate Wpol+  +  WpolS.

The vector meson contributions to the low-energy constants of the O(p4) weak Lagrangian have been discussed in [\cite=EKW93] [\cite=DP97]. Employing the vector field formulation of Ref. [\cite=DP97], the result for Wpol+  +  WpolS is independent of the factorization hypothesis and can be specified in terms of a single unknown parameter ηV

[formula]

where |fV|≃0.20, as obtained from Γ(ρ0  →  e+e-). The logarithmic term in ([\ref=eq:w4]) is a residual effect of the loop amplitudes, whereas the term proportional to fV is the local vector meson contribution. The ηV parameter is not known but is expected to be in the range [formula]; in principle it is measurable in other processes [\cite=DP97]. Note that for typical values of ηV (but for ηV≃1 / 2) the local vector meson contribution is dominant. A relation equivalent to ([\ref=eq:w4]) was obtained in [\cite=EKW93] under the factorization assumption (the result of [\cite=EKW93] is obtained from ([\ref=eq:w4]) with the substitution ηV  →  kF). As discussed in [\cite=EKW93], the separate predictions of aS and a+ involve an additional unknown coupling which is difficult to interpret in the framework of VMD.

The evaluation of the O(p6) local terms generated by vector meson exchange is more involved [\cite=DP96] [\cite=DP98]. In general, we can identify two kinds of contributions: those originating from genuine O(p6) weak transitions and those generated by the pole expansion of the leading O(p4) VMD results (we refer to [\cite=DP96] [\cite=DP98] for a detailed discussion). Interestingly enough, all the effects of the genuine O(p6) weak transitions, evaluated under the factorization assumption, drop out in the sum Wpol+  +  WpolS. Moreover, the O(p6) vector exchange contributions only modify the slope parameters bi, leading to the simple result

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=eq:w4]) and ([\ref=eq:w6]) and neglecting the presumably small logarithmic term in ([\ref=eq:w4]), we then obtain

[formula]

In order to disentangle neutral and charged channels beyond the above relation one has to rely on additional assumptions. We notice that out of the two solutions for a+ and b+ discussed in the previous section, the one with a+  <  0, consistent with chiral counting, is also compatible with the relation b+  /  a+  =  1 / r2V. This would follow directly from the assumption of vector meson dominance in the polynomial part of the form factor, i.e. from the hypothesis

[formula]

As commented previously, both form factors Wpol+ and WpolS may receive short-distance type contributions that in principle could spoil this relation. However, the form factor of the matrix element [formula] exhibits a clear K*(892) pole dominance (in the SU(3) limit it coincides with the electromagnetic form factor F(z) discussed in the previous section). Hence, we conclude that the pole structure of Wpoli(z) is not restricted to the long-distance part. Only the genuine O(p6) weak vector transitions could spoil the relation ([\ref=eq:ab7]). If these were negligible, and in general this is not necessarily the case, the ratio bi / ai  =  1 / r2V would hold for both channels.

We can use this assumption to analyze the [formula] mode. Taking a look at the expressions of [formula] in ([\ref=eq:BRlist]) and considering that aSbS  >  0 (as follows from bS / aS  =  1 / r2V), we observe that for [formula] (i.e. for [formula]) the constant and linear terms in aS and bS are negligible and can be dropped. In this way we obtain an expression for the branching ratios in terms of just one parameter

[formula]

from where we predict

[formula]

Unfortunately the lack of information on aS does not allow us to predict the separate rates. We note however that if aS  ~  O(1), as expected on general grounds, the electron mode should be within reach of the KLOE experiment [\cite=DPHB].

CP violation in [formula] decays

The dominance of single photon exchange does not apply to the CP-violating parts of [formula] amplitudes. In this case the hierarchy of the CKM matrix implies that Z0-penguin and W±-box diagrams, dominated by short-distance contributions, play an important role. As a result, CP-violating amplitudes can be more conveniently studied by means of an appropriate four-fermion Hamiltonian that, in the case of [formula] transitions, is known to next-to-leading order [\cite=BL94]. At scales μ  <  mc it is given by

[formula]

where τ  =    -  (V*tsVtd) / (V*usVud) and Vij denote the CKM matrix elements. Here Q1,2 are the current-current operators, [formula] the QCD penguin operators, whereas

[formula]

are generated by electroweak penguin and box diagrams [\cite=GW80] [\cite=DDG]. In the standard phase convention, the overall factor V*usVud is chosen to be real and direct CP violation is driven by the imaginary part of τ. With this choice of phase, only the QCD penguin operators and Q7V,Q7A are relevant for estimating direct CP-violating amplitudes. As can be understood by looking at the corresponding matrix elements, the dominant role is played by Q7V,Q7A [\cite=BL94], with y7V(1 ~ )≃5.7  ×  10- 3 and y7A(MW)≃ - 5.3  ×  10- 3 [\cite=BB96] (corresponding to [formula]).

The contribution of Q7V to [formula] decays interferes with the long-distance amplitude discussed in the previous sections. In fact, the contribution proportional to the coefficient z7V is already included in the polynomial part of the K  →  πγ* form factor (as discussed in section [\ref=sect:insights]). On the contrary, the interference of Q7A with the photon exchange amplitude vanishes as long as the lepton polarizations are summed over. In the following we shall discuss the role of y7VQ7V in KL  →  π0e+e- and K±  →  π±e+e- decays.

4.1

From the definition ([\ref=eq:tff]), CP invariance would imply that the KL  →  π0γ* form factor WL(z) vanishes. In the limit of CP conservation, the decay KL  →  π0e+e- can only proceed through the two-photon process KL  →  π0γγ  →  π0e+e- [\cite=EPR88] [\cite=CPC9] [\cite=DG] or via subleading terms in the expansion of the W±-box diagram [\cite=BI]. The former mechanism is expected to be dominant yielding [formula] [\cite=DP96] [\cite=CPC9] [\cite=DG].

In the presence of CP violation, the KL  →  π0e+e- transition can also proceed through the small εKK1 piece of the KL wave function (indirect CP violation) or via the direct CP-violating amplitude generated by ([\ref=eq:heff]). The contribution of y7VQ7V appears in the function WpolL, defined in analogy to ([\ref=eq:Wpol]), with

[formula]

where λt  =  VtdV*ts. On the other side, the indirect CP-violating contribution is given in terms of the parameter εK as A(KL  →  π0e+e-)ind  =  |εK|eiπ / 4A(KS  →  π0e+e-). Summing the two vector-like CP-violating contributions, one has

[formula]

Unfortunately the sign of aS is not known. Moreover, we recall that for [formula] the dominant term in B(KS  →  π0e+e-) is provided by a2S, therefore it is hopeless trying to extract information about the sign of aS from the measurement of B(KS  →  π0e+e-). However, since aS is real a strong interference (constructive or destructive) is expected for |aS| and |λt / 10- 4| of the same order of magnitude.

Including the CP-violating contribution of the Q7A operator that does not interfere with ([\ref=eq:wlpol]), we collect all the CP-violating terms in KL  →  π0e+e- obtaining

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:brs]) and ([\ref=eq:cpvtot]) a very interesting scenario emerges for [formula] or [formula]. Since λt is expected to be ~  10- 4, one would have [formula] in this case. Then the CP-conserving contribution, which does not interfere with the CP-violating part in the rate, could be neglected. Moreover, the KS  →  π0e+e- branching ratio would be large enough to allow a direct determination of |aS|. Thus, from the interference term in ([\ref=eq:cpvtot]) one could perform an independent measurement of λt, with a precision increasing with the value of |aS|.

A relation similar to ([\ref=eq:cpvtot]) can be traced from the work of Dib et al. [\cite=DDG] (see also [\cite=BB96]). We note that this result arises from the VMD assumption about the KS  →  π0e+e- form factor discussed in section [\ref=sect:insights], which leads to ([\ref=eq:wlpol]). According to this hypothesis, the relative weight of direct and indirect CP-violating components in ([\ref=eq:cpvtot]) is not affected by possible cuts in the z spectrum. On the contrary, we recall that the CP-conserving rate does have a different (softer) spectrum in z: essentially the factor λ3 / 2(1,z,r2π) in ([\ref=fspectrum]) is replaced by λ5 / 2(1,z,r2π) [\cite=EPR88] [\cite=DG] [\cite=BI]. This fact could provide an additional handle for disentangling the various components of KL  →  π0e+e-.

4.2

The interference of the long-distance K  →  πγ* amplitude and the short-distance contribution of y7VQ7V leads to an asymmetry between the widths of K+  →  π+e+e- and K-  →  π-e+e-, which is a clear signal of direct CP violation [\cite=EPR88]. This quantity, defined by

[formula]

can be calculated unambiguously up to a sign. Indeed, the only contribution to Wpol+ comes from the short-distance regime and it is given by

[formula]

whereas the imaginary part of Wππ+ is determined by the physical K+  →  π+π+π- amplitude. Using the results in ([\ref=eq:Wpp]-[\ref=eq:cd]) and the experimental value of Γ(K+  →  π+e+e-), we get

[formula]

The numerical value in ([\ref=eq:asr]) corresponds to an increase of a factor ~  2 over the estimate at leading order in the chiral expansion [\cite=EPR88]. However, given that λt  ~  10- 4, it is still very difficult to detect such an effect, at least within the Standard Model.

A more interesting observable is the unintegrated asymmetry defined by

[formula]

that we have plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:asyplot] both at leading order in the chiral expansion and including unitarity corrections. This asymmetry is seen to have a maximum around z≃0.4 that, being far away from the dominant background, could be more easily accessible from the experimental point of view than the integrated asymmetry.

Conclusions

We have performed a model-independent analysis of [formula] and [formula] decays including K  →  3π unitarity corrections and a general polynomial decomposition of the remaining dispersive amplitude. Using as input the presently available data on K+  →  π+e+e- [\cite=AL92], we concluded that the ratio R  =  B(K+  →  π+μ+μ-)  /  B(K+  →  π+e+e-) must be larger than 0.23 unless there is a contribution from some non-standard physics. This result is to be compared with the recent measurement R  =  0.167  ±  0.036 [\cite=AD97].

We have shown that it is very difficult to predict B(KS  →  π0e+e-) without strong model-dependent assumptions, except for an approximate upper bound B(KS  →  π0e+e-) [formula]. On the other hand, a realistic estimate of the muon/electron ratio can be obtained in the framework of VMD: B(KS  →  π0μ+μ-)  /  B(KS  →  π0e+e-)≃0.23.

We have reanalysed the CP-violating contributions to KL  →  π0e+e-, emphasizing a possible strong interference (destructive or constructive) between direct and indirect CP-violating amplitudes. Together with a precise determination of B(KS  →  π0e+e-), this could provide a possible handle for isolating the direct CP-violating component. Finally, while the unitarity corrections lead to an increase of about 100% for the charge asymmetry Γ(K+  →  π+e+e-) - Γ(K-  →  π-e+e-), the Standard Model prediction is still too small to be within reach of forthcoming experiments.

Note added At the recent ICHEP98 in Vancouver, preliminary results from a high-statistics K+  →  π+e+e- experiment (BNL-E865, presented by Hong Ma) were announced. While the mean value of the decay rate agrees with the previous measurement [\cite=AL92], the slope is significantly bigger: λ  =  0.20  ±  0.02. Although such a big slope is still compatible with the theoretical expectation |b+| < |a+|, the parameter |b+| would have to be bigger than the naive VMD prediction b+ = a+ / r2V, but consistent with the factorization model predictions for the genuine O(p6) vector meson contribution. Finally, we observe that the larger slope aggravates the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the μ / e ratio R.
