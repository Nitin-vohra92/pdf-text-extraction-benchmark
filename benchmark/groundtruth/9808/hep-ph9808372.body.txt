Formulation of the Problem

Neutral current scattering of electrons and protons proceeds via the exchange of photons and Z bosons. If there exist additional heavy gauge bosons in Nature, these would also give some contribution to the cross section. So, they could be detectable at the LEP  ×  LHC  . The experimental sensitivity of the reaction

[formula]

to details of the Z' model has been studied earlier ( [formula] and refs. quoted therein) and also in a contribution to this workshop [formula]. It is well-known that the Born cross section may be modified strongly by radiative corrections of the standard model. These effects have to be under definite control. For the annihilation channel, the problem has been solved in [formula] where some of the notations used may be found. Here, we calculate the weak and QED corrections to reaction ([\ref=eq1]) in presence of an additional heavy gauge boson Z'.

The Born cross section may be denoted as follows:

[formula]

In a compact notation, the six contributions are:

[formula]

The couplings in the standard theory are:

[formula]

Here, i = 0,1 are photon and Z boson with Qe =  - 1,IL3(e) =  - 1 / 2.

We now discuss the inclusion of the QED corrections. For the standard theory, for the γZ' interference, and for the pure Z' contribution, this may be done following e.g. [formula] correct to order O(α) or e.g. [formula] in the leading log approximation (LLA). The term to be determined additionally is the ZZ' interference. We have calculated the bremsstrahlung corrections in LLA which is known to agree with the exact calculation within about 1 % or better. We took into account all the contributions which are discussed in [formula] where also the notational details may be found. The general form of the bremsstrahlung terms is:

[formula]

Finally, the weak loop corrections of the standard theory are taken into account using the form factor approach [formula]. This leads to an introduction of finite renormalisation factors for the Fermi constant from muon decay and for the weak mixing angle as being defined in the on mass shell renormalisation scheme:

[formula]

In the effective Born cross section, we also use a running αQED(Q2). Leaving out the complex details of weak loop effects, we quote only the leading, universal t-quark mass effects [formula]:

[formula]

Extra Z bosons

We study the interaction of photon, standard Z boson and one extra Z boson Z' with fermions:

[formula]

where the currents are of the form

[formula]

The physical mass eigenstates Z1 and Z2 are the result of a mixing between Z and Z'. From experimental data the corresponding mixing angle is known to be very small, cos θM  ≈  0.

We now investigate numerical consequences of extra Z bosons arising from a grand unified theory based on the E6 group[formula]:

[formula]

The following linear combination of the two extra Z bosons Zχ of U(1)χ and Zψ of U(1)ψ is assumed to be light[formula]:

[formula]

We consider three models which differ in their phenomenological consequences considerably as has been studied in[formula]: model A (B, C) with θE  =   - 0.9117   (0., 1.3181). The relation to the mixing angle α of ref.[formula] is: θE  =  α  -  π / 2.

Results

We discuss radiative corrections in presence of a Z' for parameters and observables as used in [formula]:

[formula]

where the degree of polarisation has been chosen to be λ  =  0.8.

At small y, where also the energy scale set by Q2 is small, both the left-right asymmetries and the corrections to them are small since the symmetric pure photon exchange dominates. Although the largest cross section corrections are due to bremsstrahlung (especially at large y), being followed by those due to the running α, this is not true for asymmetries as is seen best from figs. 1 and 2. There, the loop corrections dominate over bremsstrahlung. Further, a closer inspection shows that the influences from a running α and the weak form factor effects are of the same size and have equal sign. For comparison, the curves from the standard model predictions are also shown. They are corrected by LLA bremsstrahlung, by effects due to running αQED and the weak form factors. As may be seen they behave such that a distinct experimental signal from a Z' deserves a careful analysis of data.

We conclude that in the analysis of experimental asymmetries all different origins of radiative corrections have to be carefully taken into account. This is even more important for the charge asymmetries as shown in figs. 3 and 4.
