Predictions for mt, tan β,mντ are calculated for quadruple third family t - b - τ  -  ντ Yukawa unified models in the MSSM. The renormalisation group equations for the 3 families of the MSSM, including the right handed neutrino, are presented. For right handed tau neutrino Majorana masses that are bigger than 1011 GeV, the tau neutrino mass is consistent with present cosmological bounds. The mt, tan β predictions are approximately equivalent to those in triple third family Yukawa unified models.

The origin of the Yukawa couplings of the quarks and leptons is one of the major puzzles facing the standard model. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), and in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), some simplifications may occur. The reason for this is simply that the low-energy gauge couplings, when evolved using the renormalisation group equations (RGE's) of the MSSM, converge at a scale MX = 1016 - 1017 GeV, which hints at some further stage of unification at this scale. Unified or partially unified gauge groups often constrain not only the gauge couplings but also the Yukawa couplings of the theory, and offer the possibility of understanding the low-energy Yukawa couplings in terms of some simple pattern of Yukawa couplings at the high-energy scale MX.

It was realized some time ago that the simplest grand unified theories (GUTs) based on SU(5) predict the Yukawa couplings of the bottom quark and the tau lepton to be equal at the GUT scale [\cite=SU(5)],

[formula]

where MX  ~  1016 GeV. Assuming the effective low energy theory below MGUT to be that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) the boundary condition in Eq.[\ref=btau] leads to a physical bottom to tau mass ratio mb / mτ that is in good agreement with experiment [\cite=btauold]. Spurred on by recent LEP data which is consistent with coupling constant unification, the relation in Eq.[\ref=btau] has recently been the subject of intense scrutiny using increasingly sophisticated levels of approximation [\cite=btaunew] [\cite=bandb].

One may take this idea a stage further and consider theories based on SO(10) or SU(4)[formula]SU(2)[formula]SU(2)R [\cite=Yuk] [\cite=patimass] [\cite=otherpati] which predict the Yukawa couplings of the top quark, bottom quark and tau lepton all to be equal at the unification scale,

[formula]

In such theories the top and bottom Yukawa couplings run almost identically down to low energies, and the observed mass splitting between the top and bottom is ascribed to a large ratio of vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the two Higgs doublets of the MSSM, where the Higgs doublet which gains the large VEV couples to the top quark, and the Higgs doublet which gains the small VEV couples to the bottom quark. This ratio of VEVs is conventionally defined to be [formula], so that top-bottom-tau Yukawa unification predicts large tan β  ≈  mt / mb.

In this letter we shall include the tau neutrino Yukawa coupling, which is predicted in some models to be equal to that of the other third family Yukawa couplings at the unification scale MX:

[formula]

We refer to this as quadruple Yukawa unification. As we shall see, the extra neutrino couplings can influence the predictions which follow from top-bottom-tau Yukawa unification if the right-handed neutrinos have a Majorana mass M < MX. Such right-handed neutrino Majorana masses may occur in the two-loop Witten mechanism, for example [\cite=Witten].

The trilinear superpotential for the MSSM including a right handed neutrino is

[formula]

where YU, YD, YE and YN label the up quark, down quark, charged lepton and neutrino Yukawa matrices respectively. When the Higgs particles obtain their vacuum expectation values (VEVs) 〈H1〉  =  v cos β and 〈H2〉  =  v sin β, the neutrinos acquire Dirac masses mD.

The one loop coupling evolution of the Yukawa couplings in Eq.[\ref=3famsuperpot] was calculated in the [formula] renormalisation scheme, using an analysis of general superpotentials performed by Martin and Vaughn [\cite=MandV]:

[formula]

where bi = (33 / 5,1, - 3), t  =   ln μ and μ is the [formula] renormalisation scale.

The see saw mechanism assumes the neutrino mass terms are of the form

[formula]

where M >  > mD is the Majorana mass of the right handed neutrino. In general, mD and M are 3 by 3 matrices in family space. In quadruple Yukawa unified models, the Dirac masses mD of νe and νμ are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of the third family, similar to the charged fermions. It is therefore a good approximation to consider the third family alone and drop smaller Yukawa couplings.

Once the small couplings have been dropped, Eqs.[\ref=RG1nuR] reduce to the RGEs derived in [\cite=nubtaumass]:

[formula]

where [formula] takes into account the large mass suppression of the right-handed neutrino loops at scales μ < M. Thus we integrate out loops involving right-handed neutrinos at M, but retain the Dirac Yukawa coupling λντ which describes the coupling of left to right-handed neutrinos. The running procedure to determine the low energy masses is then to run down the (Dirac) neutrino Yukawa coupling λντ from MX to low-energies using the above RGEs. Then at low-energies we use the usual see-saw mechanism to determine the mass of the physical light tau neutrino.

The procedure to extract the predictions from quadruple Yukawa unification is as follows. Values of M, mb(mb), αs(MZ) and MX (the unification scale) were chosen as free parameters. Values of a scale Λ and λ33(MX) are taken. The gauge couplings gi are determined at MX by using the input values α1(MZ)- 1 = 58.89, α2(MZ)- 1 = 29.75 and α3(MZ) = 0.10 - 0.13. The gauge couplings were then run to Λ by using the standard model RG equations including 5 quark flavours and no scalar fields. The whole superparticle spectrum of the MSSM is assumed to lie at Λ as an approximation and the gauge couplings are determined at MX by using the RGEs for the MSSM [\cite=bandb]. Although exact gauge unification is not imposed, it is nevertheless approximately realised. Λ is taken to be mt  ~  Msusy and Eq.[\ref=quadyukunified] is imposed as a boundary condition. The third family and gauge couplings are evolved from MX to Λ using Eq.s[\ref=3rdfamnuReqs].

The various couplings at Λ were determined as follows. The running masses of the fermions mb,τ(Λ), were determined by running them up from their mass shell values mf(mf) with effective 3 loop QCD [formula] 1 loop QED [\cite=3loopqcdi] [\cite=3loopQCDii] [\cite=3loopQCDiii] [\cite=guts]. This enables us to calculate cos β at Λ from the λτ(Λ) predicted by quadruple Yukawa unification:

[formula]

The determination of cos β allows us to make the following mass predictions from the Yukawa couplings calculated at the scale Λ,

[formula]

Values of Λ and λ33(MX) are searched through until mt  =  Λ is a prediction of Eq.[\ref=btpredictions], and mb(Λ) is predicted by Eq.[\ref=btpredictions] to be the empirically derived value obtained by running mb(μ) up from mb(mb) as explained above. The light tau neutrino mass can now be predicted by diagonalising Eq.[\ref=seesawmatrix] in the one family case and extracting the small mass eigenvalue:

[formula]

This equation is approximately correct because the Dirac mass does not renormalise significantly from mt to MZ and below that scale, effective QCD[formula]QED does not renormalise neutrino masses. We thus have a prediction for mt but whereas the mt referred to here is the running one, it can be related as in [\cite=bandb] to the physical mass by

[formula]

Fig.[\ref=fig:mtopnuR] displays the difference in the mt predictions for different M. M = 1016 GeV corresponds to integrating out the right handed neutrino at MX and so reduces to the previously studied case of triple Yukawa unification in the MSSM [\cite=so10nonren] [\cite=ourpaper]. As the figure shows, including the right handed neutrino Yukawa coupling makes only a small difference of up to 3 GeV to mt. mt is insensitive to whether the unification scale is 1016 or 1017 GeV. Experimentally derived errors on mb,αS(MZ) provide a much larger variation in mt. Fig.[\ref=fig:tanbnuR] shows the difference in the tan β prediction when the right handed neutrino is included. Again, only a small deviation from the triple Yukawa unification prediction is observed. mb and αS(MZ) uncertainties provide a larger deviation in the prediction [\cite=patimass]. tan β is also insensitive to whether MX = 1016 or 1017 GeV. Because tan β and mt do not change significantly once the right handed neutrinos has been taken into account, it is reasonable to state that previous third family calculations based on triple Yukawa unification in the MSSM are valid in this scheme also.

Fig.[\ref=fig:mnuR] shows the physical masses of the tau neutrino for M = 1011,12,13 GeV. For M = 1010 GeV, mντ  >  150 eV and so is excluded on cosmological grounds. In fact, the cosmological bound

[formula]

translates into a bound on the Majorana mass: M > 1010 GeV. Note that M > 1013 GeV implies that the tau neutrino would not be massive enough to observe with present experiments. The choice of MX does not make an appreciable difference to the tau neutrino mass. The effect of the empirical range of mb = 4.1 - 4.4 GeV is shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:mnumbR] for M = 1011 GeV. mντ can vary by up 50 percent at low αS(MZ) for different values of mb(mb). Similar plots are obtained when MX is set equal to 1017 GeV. Different M values reproduce similar plots, with the mass scaled as in Fig.[\ref=fig:mnuR].

The high value of tan β required for triple or quadruple Yukawa unification is not stable under radiative corrections unless some other mechanism such as extra approximate symmetries are invoked. mt may have been overestimated, since for high tan β, the equations for the running of the Yukawa couplings in the MSSM can get corrections of a significant size from Higgsino-stop and gluino-sbottom loops. The size of this effect depends upon the mass spectrum and may be as much as 30 GeV [\cite=so10nonren]. Not included in our analysis are threshold effects, at low or high energies. These could alter our results by several per cent and so it should be borne in mind that all of the mass predictions have this uncertainty in them. It is also unclear how reliable 3 loop perturbative QCD at 1 GeV is.

In conclusion, we have derived 3 family RGEs for the MSSM that include the neutrino Yukawa coupling. We impose quadruple Yukawa unification and make predictions for mt, tan β and mντ. The values of mt and tan β predicted in this scheme are approximately equivalent to results from triple Yukawa unification for values of M that do not violate the cosmological bound on the neutrino masses (M > 1010 GeV). A range of M = 1011 - 1012 GeV predicts a tau neutrino mass that does not violate the cosmological bound in Eq.[\ref=cosmobound] and that could possibly be observed in present day experiments. Is such a value of M reasonable theoretically? A survey has recently been made of the application of the Witten mechanism [\cite=Witten] to various models [\cite=stringyseesaw], where it was seen that usually rather low values of M are found. Interestingly, out of several models examined, supersymmetric SU(4)[formula]SU(2)[formula]SU(2)R gave the highest M generated by the Witten mechanism [\cite=stringyseesaw]. In that model, M  ~  MX / (105 - 106) and so M = 1011 GeV could result if MX  ~  1017 GeV. This model [\cite=patimass] [\cite=otherpati] also predicts quadruple Yukawa unification and so provides a predictive and simple scheme of viable tau neutrino mass generation.
