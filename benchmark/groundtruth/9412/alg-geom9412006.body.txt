On the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology sheaves

Introduction

For X a compact complex algebraic manifold the Deligne cohomology H*(X,(  ·  )D) is defined by taking the hypercohomology of the truncated De Rham complex augmented over [formula]. The very extension of such a cohomology theory to arbitrary algebraic complex varieties is usually called Deligne-Beilinson cohomology (e.g.  see [\cite=GI] for definitions and properties or [\cite=HV] for details). The associated Zariski sheaves H*((  ·  )D) have groups of global sections which are birational invariants of smooth complete varieties (see [\cite=BV1], [\cite=BV2]). The motivation for this paper is to investigate these invariants. We can show that the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology sheaves Hq + 1((q)D) are torsion free  by assuming Kato's conjectures hold true for function fields (see § 2). In particular H3((2)D) is actually torsion free thanks to Merkur'ev-Suslin's Theorem on K2. Thus these invariants vanish  for unirational varieties. If only H2(X,OX) = 0 we then can show (see § 3) that the group of global sections of H3((2)D) is exactly  the kernel of the cycle map CH2(X)  →  H4(X,(2)D) in Deligne cohomology i.e.  the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi map. This fact generalizes the result of H.Esnault for 0-cycles (cf.  [\cite=H]), in the case of codimension 2 cycles, to X of arbitrary dimension and it is obtained by a different proof. Concerning the discrete part [formula] of the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology sheaf H2((2)D) (as defined in op. cit.  or § 2) we can describe, for any X proper and smooth, the torsion of [formula] in terms of 'trascendental cycles' and H3(X,)tors, and we can see that there are not non-zero global sections of it (see § 3). For surfaces with pg = 0 we are able to compute the group of global sections of H3((2)D) -- Bloch's conjecture is that H0(X,H3((2)D)) = 0 -- by means of some short exact sequences (see § 4) involving the discrete part [formula] and the Hodge filtration. In order to do that we are firstly arguing (see § 1) with arithmetic resolutions of the Zariski sheaves associated with the presheaves of mixed Hodge structures defined by singular cohomology: the Hodge and weight filtrations do have corresponding coniveau spectral sequences, the E2 terms of which are given by the cohomology groups of the Zariski sheaves associated to such filtrations. I would like to thank B.Kahn for friendly useful conversations on some of the matters contained herein.

Notations

Throughout this note X is a complex algebraic variety. We will denote by H*(X,A) (resp. H*(X,A)) the singular cohomology (resp. Borel-Moore homology) of the associated analytic space [formula] with coefficients in A where A would be , / n, and *; we let H*(X) (resp. H*(X)) be the corresponding mixed Hodge structure (see [\cite=D]). We will denote by WiH*(X) (resp. W- iH*(X)) the [formula]-vector spaces given by the weight filtration and by FiH*(X) (resp. F- iH*(X)) the real vector spaces given by the Hodge filtration. For the ring [formula] of integers we will denote by (r) the Tate twist in Hodge theory and by H*(X,(r)D) the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology groups (see [\cite=HV], [\cite=GI]). The Tate twist induces the twist [formula] in the coefficients which we will denote A(r) for short. We will denote by H*(A(r)) and H*((r)D) the Zariski sheaves on a given X associated to singular cohomology and Deligne-Beilinson cohomology respectively.

Arithmetic resolutions in mixed Hodge theory

Let [formula] be a closed subscheme of the complex algebraic variety X. According with Deligne [\cite=D] the relative cohomology groups H*Z(X,) (= H*(X modX - Z,) in op. cit. ) carry out a mixed Hodge structure fitting into long exact sequences

[formula]

for any pair Z  ⊂  T of closed subschemes of X. As it has been remarked in [\cite=JA] the assignation

[formula]

yields a Poincaré duality theory with supports (see [\cite=BO] and furthermore we have that the above theory is appropriate for albegraic cycles in the sense of [\cite=BV2]) with values in the abelian tensor category of mixed Hodge structures. In particular, by considering the presheaf of vector spaces

[formula]

(resp. [formula]) and sheafifying it on a fixed variety X, we obtain Zariski sheaves FiHj (resp. WiHj) filtering the sheaves Hj(). We then have:

Let X be smooth. The 'arithmetic resolution'

[formula]

is a bifiltered quasi-isomorphism

[formula]

yielding flasque resolutions

[formula]

Because of [\cite=D] the functors Fn, Wn and grnF (any n∈) from the category of mixed Hodge structures to that of real vector spaces are exact; grWn is exact as a functor from mixed Hodge structures to pure [formula]-Hodge structures. So the claimed results are obtained via the 'locally homologically effaceable' property (see [\cite=BO]) by construction of the arithmetic resolution (granted by [\cite=BO]). For example: by applying Fi to the long exact sequences ([\ref=loc]), taking direct limits over pairs Z  ⊂  T filtered by codimension and sheafifying, we do obtain a flasque resolution of length q

[formula]

where

[formula]

By this method we obtain as well a resolution of Wj

[formula]

These resolutions grant us of the claimed bifiltered quasi-isomorphism. (Note: for X of dimension d, the fundamental class ηX belongs to [formula] so that 'local purity' yields the shift by two for the weight filtration and the shift by one for the Hodge filtration). In the same way we obtain resolutions of griF, grWj and griFgrWj.

We may consider the twisted Poincaré duality theory (FnH*,F- mH*) where the integers n and m play the role of twisting and indeed we have

[formula]

for X smooth of dimension d. Via the arithmetic resolution of FiHq we then have the following:

Let assume X smooth and let i be a fixed integer. We then have a 'coniveau spectral sequence'

[formula]

where Hp(X,FiHq) = 0 if q < (i,p).

Because of the maps of 'Poincaré duality theories' FiH*( - )  →  H*( - ,) we do have as well, maps of coniveau spectral sequences; on the E2-terms the map

[formula]

is given by taking Zariski cohomology of [formula]. For example: if i < p we clearly have (by comparing the arithmetic resolutions): [formula] and

[formula]

by [\cite=BO] where NSp(X) is the group of cycles of codimension p modulo algebraic equivalence. For i = p we still have:

Let X be smooth. Then

[formula]

Because of the Proposition [\ref=arifilt]

[formula]

whence the canonical map [formula] is surjective. To show the injectivity, via the arithmetic resolution we see that

[formula]

where H*Zi denotes the direct limit of the cohomology groups with support on closed subsets of codimension ≥  i; indeed this formula is obtained by taking the direct limit of ([\ref=loc]) over pairs Z  ⊂  T of codimension ≥  p and ≥  p - 1 respectively, since H2p - 1Zp = 0 and

[formula]

Furthermore

[formula]

and

[formula]

since the arithmetic resolution of Hp  /  Fp has lenght p - 1. Thus we have that

[formula]

For any X smooth and proper, we have that F2H2(X) = H0(X,F2H2) = H0(X,Ω2X) and

[formula]

where [formula] and H0(X,H2())  =  im  (H2(X,)  →  H2(X,OX)) is the lattice of 'trascendental cycles'. The formula ([\ref=genus]) can be obtained, for example, by the exact sequence (given by the coniveau spectral sequence since F2H1 = 0)

[formula]

because of [formula].

Deligne-Beilinson cohomology sheaves

Let X be smooth over [formula]. Let consider the Zariski sheaf H*((r)D) associated to the presheaf of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology groups [formula] on X. We have canonical long exact sequences of sheaves on X

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

obtained by sheafifying the usual long exact sequences coming with Deligne-Beilinson cohomology (see [\cite=HV]). For example, if r = 0 then Hq() / F0 = 0 and ([\ref=modf]) yields the isomorphism [formula]; ([\ref=plusf]) splits in trivial short exact sequences and ([\ref=star]) give us the following short exact sequence

[formula]

whenever the sheaves Hq() and Hq + 1() are torsion free which is the case if q  ≤  2 (cf.  [\cite=BV1] and [\cite=BlS]). Torsion freeness of Hq() for all q  ≥  4 is a conjectural property (see [\cite=BV1]). In order to show that Hq + 1() is torsion free it sufficies to see that Hq()  →  Hq( / n) is an epimorphism for any n∈; via the canonical map O*X  →  H1() and cup-product we obtain a map [formula]. The composition of

[formula]

can be obtained as well as (cf.  [\cite=BlS]) the composition of

[formula]

where by definition of Milnor's K-theory sheaf the symbol map sym is an epimorphism thus we are left to show that the Galois symbol KMq  →  Hq( / n) is an epimorphism (for the sake of exposition we are tacitly fixing an n-th root of unity yielding a non-canonical isomorphism [formula]); this last map can be obtained by mapping the Gersten complex for Milnor's K-theory to the Bloch-Ogus arithmetic resolution of the sheaf Hq( / n) i.e.  there is a commutative diagram

[formula]

where H*() is the Galois cohomology of k(). Indeed O.Gabber announced the (universal) exactness of the above complex of Milnor's K-groups. Thus: by assuming Kato's conjecture i.e.  [formula], a diagram chase yields the desired projection KMq  →  Hq( / n). (My thanks to B.Kahn for having directed my attention to Gabber's result.) Let consider the 'discrete part' of the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology sheaves which is by definition (cf.  [\cite=H])

[formula]

or, equivalently by ([\ref=modf]), the integral part of FrHq. We may define the 'trascendental part' of the Deligne-Beilinson cohomology sheaves as follows

[formula]

In particular, if r = q we then have (cf.  [\cite=H]) the short exact sequence (by ([\ref=star]) or ([\ref=modf]) taking account of ([\ref=universal]))

[formula]

and moreover we have the following commutative diagram with exact rows and columns

[formula]

where the middle row is given by ([\ref=universal]), the top one by ([\ref=modf]) and the right-most column is obtained by ([\ref=star]).

We have a short exact sequence of sheaves:

[formula]

for all q,r  ≥  0 and n∈.

The sequence ([\ref=unidel]) is obtained from the long exact sequence ([\ref=modf]) as follows. Since the sheaf Hq + 1((r)) is torsion free we do have that

[formula]

Since the sheaf Hq() / Fr is uniquely divisible we have that

[formula]

because of the following short exact sequence

[formula]

Thus we get a short exact sequence

[formula]

by tensoring with  / n the canonical one induced by the subsheaf [formula]. Since Tr,qD is divisible we are done.

By considering the Bloch-Beilinson regulators

[formula]

(simply obtained by the fact that [formula] and cup-product) we have that the composition of

[formula]

is the Galois symbol (cf.  [\cite=HM]). We thus have that the composition of

[formula]

is an epimorphism if Kato's conjectures hold. Therefore, by comparing with ([\ref=unidel]), we have a proof of the following:

Let assume that Kato's conjectures (for function fields) hold true. On a smooth X we then have:

for any q  ≥  0.

Note that the Theorem of Merkur'ev-Suslin (= Kato's conjecture for KM2) ensures the previous results when q = 2. Moreover, by a standard argument (cf.  [\cite=BV1] and [\cite=BV2]) we have the following:

With the assumptions in the Theorem above, let suppose that X is moreover unirational and complete. Then

[formula]

Coniveau versus Hodge filtrations

We recall (see [\cite=GI]) the existence of arithmetic resolutions of the sheaves H*((  ·  )D) thus the coniveau spectral sequence

[formula]

and the formula (see [\cite=GI]) [formula]. By the spectral sequence ([\ref=conideli]) we have a long exact sequence

[formula]

The mapping δ is just a differential between [formula]-terms of the coniveau spectral sequence ([\ref=conideli]); we still have

[formula]

Let X be proper and smooth. Then

[formula]

the group [formula] is infinitely divisible and

[formula]

If H2(X,OX) = 0 then

[formula]

i.e.  ρ = 0 in ([\ref=delseq]), and [formula].

By the canonical map of 'Poincaré duality theories'

[formula]

we do obtain a map of coniveau spectral sequences and the following commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] and the left-most map is induced by the short exact sequence of sheaves ([\ref=disc]) whence [formula] and [formula] are respectively the kernel and the cokernel of [formula] in fact: the cokernel is computed by the vanishing of H2(X,H1(*(2))) and the kernel is obtained because of [formula], [formula] (note that [formula] is flasque) and [formula] since X is proper i.e.  [formula]. Furthermore we have that [formula] and [formula] vanishes because [formula]. Since H0(X,H3((2)D)) is torsion free (by the Theorem [\ref=Kato]) then im  ρ is torsion free and infinitely divisible indeed, therefore

[formula]

and by taking the torsion subgroups in the diagram ([\ref=cocco]) we obtain the assertion about the torsion of [formula]. In order to show the second part of the statement, since [formula], we then have (by the bottom row of the diagram ([\ref=cocco]) above) that [formula] and its image in H0(X,H3((2)D)) is equal to the image of ρ, whence the image of ρ is zero since it is torsion free. Since F2H2 = 0 by diagram chase we obtain the last claim.

In order to detect elements in the misterious group of global sections H0(X,H3((2)D)) we dispose of the image of H0(X,H2  /  F2), see ([\ref=genus]), which is the same (cf.  the diagram ([\ref=dia])) as the image of [formula]. Unfortunately these images cannot be the entire group, in general. Indeed we have that whenever the map

[formula]

is surjective then ρ is surjective in ([\ref=delseq]) (because of ([\ref=cocco])) whence the cycle map is injective which is not the case in general (indeed for any surface with pg  ≠  0 the cycle map is not injective by Mumford [\cite=MU]).

Surfaces with pg = 0

In the following we let X denote a complex algebraic surface which is smooth and complete. Let A0(X) be the subgroup of cycles of degree zero. Let φ:A0(X)  →  J2(X) be induced by the canonical mapping to the Albanese variety. It is well known (see [\cite=GI]) that [formula], where [formula] is the cycle map in Deligne cohomology. We have:

[formula]

Indeed: the sheaf H4((2)D) vanishes on a surface (as it is easy to see via the exact sequence ([\ref=modf])) and by the spectral sequence ([\ref=conideli]) we have that H1(X,H3((2)D)) is the cokernel of the cycle map [formula] but coker[formula]coker(A0(X)  →  J2(X)) = 0. Finally we have that [formula]. Thus the only possibly non-zero terms in the spectral sequence ([\ref=conideli]) are: those giving the exact sequence ([\ref=delseq]), [formula] and H0(X,H1((2)D)) = *. We know by Mumford (see [\cite=MU]) that [formula] i.e.  δ = 0 in ([\ref=delseq]), implies pg = 0 therefore H0(X,H3((2)D)) = 0 (by Proposition [\ref=alb]). Conversely we have the following: Bloch's conjecture   If pg = 0 then [formula]. In order to test this conjecture we are reduced to compute the uniquely divisible group H0(X,H3((2)D)) (cf.  [\cite=H], [\cite=GI]). We can show the following:

Let X be a smooth complete surface with pg = 0. We then have the following canonical short exact sequences

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

All these exact sequences are obtained by considering the exact diagram of cohomology groups associated with the diagram of sheaves ([\ref=dia]) (where T2,3D  =  H3((2)D) on a surface) taking account of Theorem [\ref=Kato], Theorem [\ref=Nero], Proposition [\ref=alb] and the coniveau spectral sequence ([\ref=conifilt]). For example, the sequence ([\ref=a]) is obtained by taking the long exact sequence of cohomology groups associated with the right-most column of ([\ref=dia]), the fact that [formula] on a surface and the formula ([\ref=cacca]). For ([\ref=b]) one has to use the top row of ([\ref=dia]), the formulas ([\ref=genus]) and ([\ref=cacca]), and the fact that [formula]. The left-most column of ([\ref=dia]) yields ([\ref=d]) because of [formula] by ([\ref=disc]) (cf.  [\cite=H]) and the map of sheaves H2((2)D)  →  H2((2)) induces the degree map on H2. For ([\ref=c]) one has to argue with the commutative square in the left bottom corner of ([\ref=dia]) and the isomorphim [formula]: remember that [formula] whence it goes to zero in [formula].
