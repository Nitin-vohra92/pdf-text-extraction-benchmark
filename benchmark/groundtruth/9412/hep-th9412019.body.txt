Some forty-five years ago, Feynman and Wheeler[\cite=feynman] presented an elegant idea that the action-at-a-distance (AD) force gives us a gauge field (photon) mediating electromagnetic interaction of a point particle. Use was made of this idea by Kalb and Ranomd[\cite=kalb] to describe interacting strings[\cite=kalb][\cite=ramond]. They had the results that the fields mediating the mutual interactions of strings are either massless vector fields (for closed strings) or massive vector ones (for open strings).

The present authors generalized Kalb-Ramond's method to the case where extended objects of more than one-dimension are interacting with one another[\cite=yama]. There closed p-branes were taken up and it was concluded that it is the massless gauge field that plays an essential role in the interaction of closed p-branes.

In the present paper, the authors will confront with open p-branes and construct the theory for the interacting open p-branes à la Kalb-Ramond's AD view. The existence of boundary surface in this case enforces us to take the equations on surface ad hoc into account. The difference here arises, so that one is to have a massive gauge field, as will soon be clear.

Now let us start with the following action for two p-branes, which is interacting each other through AD forces[\cite=yama]

[formula]

The p-brane is represented by the variables Xμ(ξ) [formula] in the flat D-dimensional space-time. The world sheet of the p-brane is described by the variables ξi (0  ≤  ξi  ≤  li ; [formula]. The subscript a or b labels each p-brane. Sfree is the action for a free p-brane, and is taken to be the (p + 1)-dimensional world volume traced out by the p-brane

[formula]

The notations used in this paper are as follows:

[formula]

The Rab satisfy

[formula]

for symmetry requirements of the action. The variational principle for the variation Xμa(ξ)  →  Xμa(ξ) + δXμa(ξ) immediately yields the equations of motion

[formula]

Moreover, for our open p-brane, the boundary conditions on the surface add the following equations

[formula]

Equation([\ref=eq:sur-1]) constitutes one of the main characteristics of the open p-brane, and it will play an essential role later. Here and in what follows, we define Ki and D by

[formula]

In the definition of Ki, we do not sum over the index α. We assume that Rab depends on Xμa,i only through σa. Under this restriction, we rewrite Eq.([\ref=eq:mo-1]) as

[formula]

and Eq.([\ref=eq:sur-1]) as

[formula]

Assume a concrete form of Rab just in the same way as in the case of closed p-branes:

[formula]

with ga and gb, coupling constants, and G is some propagator in D-dimensional space-time. Substitution of Eq.([\ref=def:R]) into Eqs.([\ref=eq:mo-2]) and ([\ref=eq:sur-2]) leads us to

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Fb and φb are antisymmetric tensors defined by

[formula]

Now, let us investigate the conservation of a current for field φb and the gauge invariance of the action.

First, we consider the conservation of a current. In general, G obeys, being a propagator,

[formula]

where C is a dimensionless constant and m is to be identified with the mass of the field. By Eq.([\ref=G:delta]), we obtain

[formula]

with

[formula]

We further find, with a bit of algebra, that

[formula]

Here [formula] means exclusion of dξi. On account of the existence of boundary surface, the divergence of φb does not vanish. From Eqs.([\ref=phi:cur]) and ([\ref=div:phi]) follows the equation

[formula]

which shows that the current jb would be conserved if the p-brane was closed. The modification of the current for the open p-brane will be done after the introduction of a gauge transformation.

Secondly, we examine the gauge invariance of the action, defining a gauge transformation by

[formula]

with an arbitrary antisymmetric tensor Λ. Instead of the whole action S, we take up

[formula]

i.e., the φ-depending part Sint of S. Under the transformation ([\ref=gauge1]), Sint transforms as follows:

[formula]

The second term of the right-hand side in Eq.([\ref=Gvar:Sint2]) does not vanish, here also, due to the existence of boundary surface. Note that it vanishes for closed p-branes. With Eq.([\ref=Gvar:Sint2]), one immediately sees that Sint is not invariant under the transformation ([\ref=gauge1]). Although the equations of motion ([\ref=eq:mo-3]) are invariant under this gauge transformation, the equations of boundary surface ([\ref=eq:sur-3]) are not. The latter become

[formula]

To recover the invariance of the action, we therefore add another term to the action S. Based on Eqs.([\ref=Gvar:Sint2]) and ([\ref=Gvar:eq:sur]), we take up as an additional action

[formula]

It is straightforward, under the variation in Xμa, that Sadd does not change the equations of motion. Furthermore, Eq.([\ref=def:Sadd]) is rewritten as follows:

[formula]

with

[formula]

Equations ([\ref=Sadd2]) and ([\ref=def:B]) trivially teach us that Sadd vanishes when p-branes a and b are closed.

In view of Eqs.([\ref=Gvar:Sint1]) and ([\ref=Sadd2]), we define a new gauge transformation

[formula]

It is easy to see that these transformations make the action S + Sadd invariant.

Under the variation in Xμa, the action S + Sadd yields the following equations of boundary surface

[formula]

These equations of boundary surface are invariant under the transformations ([\ref=gauge2]).

The Lagrangian density for the fields φ and B is given by

[formula]

which is also invariant under the transformations ([\ref=gauge2]). The variational principle for this Lagrangian L with respect to φ and B leads to the equation of motion for B:

[formula]

and that for φ:

[formula]

We next investigate the conservation of a current for Bb. Comparing Eq.([\ref=def:B]) with Eq.([\ref=div:phi]), we immediately find that φb and Bb satisfy a gauge condition

[formula]

Furthermore, Bb obeys

[formula]

Therefore, we define a new current Jb for Bb by

[formula]

by which we have

[formula]

According to the vanishing of the divergence of Bb, Jb satisfies the conservation law of a current

[formula]

It follows from Eqs.([\ref=phi:cur]), ([\ref=B:Cur]) and ([\ref=phi:B]) that

[formula]

This shows that the new conserved current Jb instead of the nonconserved one jb is physical. Note that the divergence of jb enters into Eq.([\ref=Cur:cur]).

With gauge conditions ([\ref=phi:B]) and ([\ref=div:B]), Eq.([\ref=eq:mo-B1]) becomes

[formula]

which means B is a field with mass

[formula]

Similarly, the equation of motion for φ is

[formula]

and φ is considered as a field with mass m = g / e.

Now we combine φ with B to introduce a new field

[formula]

It is clear that this field ψ is invariant under the transformations ([\ref=gauge2]). In terms of ψ, we can rewrite L as

[formula]

The gauge invariance of ψ also leads to the invariance of L.

The gauge conditions ([\ref=div:phi]) and ([\ref=div:B]) induce, for ψ,

[formula]

And the equation of motion for ψ is obtained as

[formula]

It shows that ψ is again a field with mass m = g / e.

Thus we have obtained a massive gauge-invariant field ψ. The total action, which describes the open p-brane and its interaction with the field ψ, is given by

[formula]

Now we come to our conclusions. As we have discussed above, it is the existence of the boundary surface that makes a difference between closed and open p-branes. Closed p-branes are described by the equations of motion ([\ref=eq:mo-3]) without equations of boundary surface. Consequently, their interactions are regarded as mediated by the massless field φ defined by Eq.([\ref=def:phi])[\cite=yama]. But when φ is introduced in case of open p-branes, two difficulties occur owing to this existence of the boundary surface of world volumes. The one is that the current j, defined by Eq.([\ref=def:cur]), for φ is not to be conserved, the other is that the action S is not gauge invariant under the transformation ([\ref=gauge1]). To overcome these difficulties we have added the new term Sadd to the action S, and defined the new gauge transformations by Eq.([\ref=gauge2]). The introduction of them brings us to that of a new field B. This further enforces us to have the action S + Sadd instead of S, by which the action has been recovered its gauge invariance. We find that the current J for the field B, which is regarded as the divergence of the current j, is conserved with Eqs.([\ref=div:Cur]) and ([\ref=Cur:cur]).

As a consequence, we have obtained the field ψ, which is constructed by the combination of the fields φ and B, as a medium of interaction of the open p-branes. In contrast to the case of the closed p-branes the field ψ has clearly a mass m = g / e; besides, it is gauge invariant under the transformation ([\ref=gauge2]).
