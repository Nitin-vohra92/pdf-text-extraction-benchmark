DOES THE EXCITED STATE OF THE 3H NUCLEUS EXIST ?

To be published in Pis'ma ZETPh 61 n.1 (1995)

Moscow - 1994

Key words: triton, neutron, deuteron, elastic scattering, resonance, virtual state

The suggestion is made that the excited state of the 3H nucleus found out recently in the reaction H(6He,α) (Pis'ma JETPh 59 (1994) 301) has spin and parity 1 / 2+ and the same configuration that the ground one of 6He. An amplitude of electromagnetic transition to the triton ground state is strongly suppressed, therefore the excited state cannot be detected in radiative capture of neutrons by deuterons. It is shown that in an elastic nd-scattering a resonance associated with the exited state may be absent due to the destructive interference of potential and resonant scattering phases.

In Ref.[\cite=1] the maximum in the cross section of the reaction H(6He,α) has been found and interpreted as the excited state of the 3H nucleus with the energy [formula] MeV and the width [formula] MeV. This result is very interesting as so far there was no evidence for triton excited states [\cite=2]. There exists, however, the reasons for skeptical attitude to the interpretation of Ref. [\cite=1]. The energy E  * is greater than the energy Eb = 6.26 MeV of the 3H nucleus break-up to neutron and deuteron approximately by 0.7 MeV. But in the total cross section of the nd-interaction there is no maximum close to the energy 0.7 MeV with the width of scale Γ  * [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. There are also no anomalies in the radiative neutron-deuteron capture near the suggested excited level of triton [\cite=5]. A reference made in Ref. [\cite=1] on the review [\cite=6] of theoretical works predicting a triton excited state lying over the break-up threshold n + d by 0.5 MeV is not quite correct as in Ref. [\cite=6] the virtual state of nd-system with the energy ~   0.5 MeV with respect to the threshold n + d is really discussed. The purpose of this paper is to show that the interpretation of Ref. [\cite=1] nevertheless can be truthful.

We discuss at first a possible configuration of the excited state of the 3H nucleus found out in Ref. [\cite=1]. In the framework of the naive shell model with the oscillator potential we have for the ground state 0+ of the 6He nucleus the following configuration. Two protons and two neutrons are at 1s-state and form α-particle, while the remaining two neutrons are at 1p-state with zero total angular momentum. Let [formula] and [formula] are position vectors of these neutrons with respect to α-particle, while a vector [formula] determines the relative position of the neutrons and [formula] is a vector of their center mass with respect to α-particle. Then for the normalized oscillator functions we have identity

[formula]

The functions [formula] in the left-hand part are written for the potential μω2r2i / 2, where μ  =   is a reduced mass of neutron and α-particle. In the right-hand part one obtains the functions [formula] for the potential μ12ω212r212 / 2, where μ12 = mn / 2 and ω12  =  , and the functions [formula] corresponding to the potential μrω2rr2 / 2, where μr  =   and ωr  =  . So according Eq.([\ref=1]) the location of two neutrons at 1p-level with zero total angular momentum is equivalent to superposition of 1s- and 2s-states on the relative variables [formula] and [formula]. It was shown in Ref.[\cite=7] that this simple picture agrees well with the real configuration of the ground state of the 6He nucleus that is a weakly bound system of three particles α + n + n.

Let us assume that the excited state of the p + n + n system found out in Ref. [\cite=1] has the same configuration ([\ref=1]) as the ground one of the 6He nucleus (proton replaces α-particle). It will be obviously the excited state 1 / 2+ of the 3H nucleus. In this model the ground state 1 / 2+ corresponds to two neutrons at 1s-state with respect to a proton. We have with that for the oscillator functions

[formula]

with the same relationships between μ,μ12,μr and ω,ω12,ωr as above stated, replacing, naturally, mα by the proton mass mp.

This hypothesis explains why the excited state does not manifest in the reaction d(n,γ). According to the quantum numbers only M1-transition is possible but a leading term of the transition amplitude equals zero due to the orthogonality of 2s- and 1s-states. This is the same situation as for 2s  →  1s transition in a hydrogen atom, where, by the way, a one-photon transition is less probable than a two-photon one.

We turn now to the analysis of an elastic nd-scattering. The total spin of neutron and deuteron is 1/2 or 3/2, therefore one distinguishes doublet and quartet channels in each partial wave. The scattering lengths in these channels are [formula] fm and [formula] fm [\cite=2].

In the absence of excited states of the 3H nucleus one should expect that the neutron-deuteron scattering at the energies below the deuteron break-up threshold Ed = 2.23 MeV is purely potential. A scattering length should thus have the scale of potential radius. Let us assume that this is the case for quartet channel. The radius of nd-potential can be very large due to the deuteron diffuseness. A radial deuteron wave function decreases at large distances as ~   exp ( - γr), where 1 / γ  ~  5 fm [\cite=9]. Adding the radius of nucleon-nucleon interaction (~  2 fm), we take the value R = 7 fm for the radius of neutron-deuteron potential. Choosing the potential in the form of a spherical rectangular well and fitting its depth in quartet channel to the value a4 = 6.34 fm we obtain U4 = 7.58 MeV. There exists a bound 1s-state in such well with the energy -3.98 MeV, however, it can not be populated in the quartet channel because of the Pauli principle.

Let us assume now that there is an excited state of triton of the p + n + n type ([\ref=1]) in the doublet channel. This state should be considered as a closed inelastic channel coupled with an elastic one n + d. We shall trace how such inelastic channel can influence the observables in an elastic channel using the simplest model of two-channel scattering [\cite=10] [\cite=11]. In this model a particle interacts with a two-state system; the energy of a ground state is zero while the energy of an excited one is ε. A resonance holds when an incident particle passes into a bound state and an excitation of internal system occurs.

We take all potentials in the form of spherical rectangular wells with the radius R = 7 fm. Let the depths of the wells in elastic and inelastic channels are U(0)2 and U(1)2 correspondingly; the depth of the channel coupling potential is W. The equations for the radial s-wave functions of elastic F(0)(r) and inelastic F(1)(r) channels at r < R are of the form

[formula]

where k is a wave number in an elastic channel, corresponding to an energy E = 2k2 / 2m (m is a reduced mass), and k1  =   is a wave number in an inelastic channel. If E < ε, an inelastic channel is closed, so k1 = iq1, where q1  =  . Outside the interaction region r > R we have

[formula]

where δ2(k) is an elastic scattering phase in the doublet channel.

The solutions of Eqs.([\ref=3]) in the region r < R, which are regular in zero, are of the form

[formula]

where   =  , ' = , Δ  =  . The matching of the functions ([\ref=4]) and ([\ref=5]) and their derivatives at r = R permits to find out the factors A(E), A'(E), S(1)(E) and the elastic scattering phase δ2(E).

A s-wave scattering phase can be expressed through the logarithmic derivative Φ2(E) =  of an elastic channel function at the matching point

[formula]

If E2 is the energy of a resonance in the doublet channel then according to the usual definition [\cite=12] Φ2(E2) = 0. Writing the function Φ2(E) near this energy in the form Φ2(E) = , we come to the Breit-Wigner description of a resonance with the reduced width γ2 and the energy dependent width Γ2(E) = 2kRγ2. If the given parametrization of a logarithmic derivative holds for the energies E  →  0, we have for the scattering length a2  =  . We obtain a small value a2 as compared with R if γ2  ~  E2. One follows from the value E2≃0.7 MeV [\cite=1] that γ2≃0.6 MeV and Γ2≃1.3 MeV. We notice that the reduced width of a purely potential resonance in the model of a spherical rectangular well γ  pot  =  2 / mR2≃1.3 MeV approximately twice surpasses the found value of γ2. Simultaneously the width Γ2 is somewhat higher than the experimental estimate Γ  * [\cite=1].

According with Eq.([\ref=6]) an elastic scattering phase in the doublet channel is the sum of a negative phase of potential scattering δ  pot(E) =  - kR and a positive phase of resonant scattering δ  res(E) = . If the radius of nd-interaction is really so large as we have assumed then at the energy E2≃0.7 MeV the potential phase reaches the value δ  pot(E2)≃ - 1.05 comparable with the absolute value of the resonant phase δ  res(E2) = π / 2. As a result the total phase δ2(E) does not pass through π / 2 in the resonance. This is an explanation of the maximum absence in the nd-scattering cross section near the energy E2.

We use the model above formulated for illustrative calculations. Let ε equals the deuteron binding energy 2.23 MeV so the energetic interval E < ε where a purely elastic scattering holds in the model coincides with the similar interval in the nd-reaction. An experimental value of scattering length in the doublet channel can be easily reproduced using the remaining three free parameters -- the depths of the potentials U(0)2, U(1)2 and W. Let, e.g., U(0)2 = 5 MeV and U(1)2 = U4. Fitting a2 to the value 0.65 fm we found W = 3.68 MeV. Then the logarithmic derivative Φ2(E) equals zero at E2 = 0.76 MeV; the reduced and total resonance widths are γ2 = 0.57 MeV and Γ02  =  Γ2(E2) = 1.24 MeV. The scattering cross sections σ2(E) = , σ4(E) =  in the doublet and quartet channels and their sum -- the total s-wave cross section are shown in Fig.[\ref=Fig.1]a. We see, that the doublet cross section σ2(E) reaches the maximal values at the energies higher than 1 MeV and slows down the drop of the total cross section in agreement with the experiment [\cite=3] [\cite=4]. An increase of the p- and d-wave contributions results in the same effect.

Thus, in the given model the resonance does not manifest as a well expressed maximum in an elastic channel because of the large potential scattering phase. However, there is an enhancement of the function F(1)(r) in an inelastic channel near the energy E2. We notice that the probability of population of the triton excited state in the reaction H(6He,α) is proportional to the squared module of matrix element of overlapping of the functions of type ([\ref=1]) for the 6He and 3H nuclei. But the triton function of type ([\ref=1]) represents the function of the inelastic channel in the reaction n + d. Thus, the enhancement of this function at the energies near E2 should correspond to the maximum in the cross section of the reaction H(6He,α). For illustration we have calculated the squared integral of the function F(1)

[formula]

in the our model. It is shown in Fig.[\ref=Fig.1]b versus the energy E. Curiously, the position and width of the maximum agree qualitatively with the values of E  * and Γ  * found out in Ref.[\cite=1].

We discuss, at last, an accordance between the excited state 1 / 2+ of the 3H nucleus and the virtual state of nd-system in the doublet channel [\cite=6]. One says about virtual state if there is a pole in an elastic scattering amplitude ([\ref=6]) in a bottom half-plane of complex values k on imaginary axis. If an energy of a resonance E2  =   is small, the Breit-Wigner approximation Φ2(k) =  may be true in some area of complex values k including zero. Then the poles kr of the amplitude ([\ref=6]) are the roots of square equation (kr)1,2 =  - ik2(Γ02 / 4E2)  ±  k2(1 - (Γ02 / 4E2)2)1 / 2. We see, that in the given approximation virtual states correspond to wide resonances Γ02 > 4E2 (both values kr lie in a bottom half-plane on imaginary axis). This is indeed the case in a singlet channel of nucleon-nucleon scattering. The poles corresponding to a resonance with a width Γ02 comparable with E2, as considered here, lie on each side of the imaginary axis.

In reality even at low energy E2 a deviation of Φ2(k) from the Breit-Wigner form can be built up rapidly when k is moving away from the real axis. Therefore the pole on imaginary axis, i.e., the virtual state, can correspond to the resonance with the width Γ02  ~  E2. However, in the given model this is not the case. Using the same parameters as were fixed above we find by direct calculation the poles of the amplitude ([\ref=6]) of doublet nd-scattering, that is, zeros of the expression Φ2(k) - ikR. Just as the roots of square equation written out, they appear located symmetrically to the imaginary axis in a bottom half-plane. We have for the complex energies (Er)1,2  =   on a non-physical sheet Re(Er)1,2  =  , Im(Er)1,2  =  . Thus, in the given model the resonance in nd-scattering (see the Fig.[\ref=Fig.1]b) is correlated with the poles of S-matrix near the imaginary axis. The pole energies on a non-physical sheet are of scale ~   0.5 MeV. Taking into account an extreme simplicity of the model under consideration one may say about qualitative agreement with the results of the works discussed in Ref. [\cite=6].

So, in this paper it was shown that the interpretation of the maximum in the reaction H(6He,α) as the excited state of the nucleus 3H does not contradict to the available experimental data and theoretical conceptions about the poles of S-matrix in nd-interaction. The excited state does not apparently manifest in the elastic nd-scattering because of the destructive interference of potential and resonant scattering phases. The reason for this effect is the anomalously large radius of nd-potential, related with the deuteron diffuseness. According to the advanced assumption about the structure of the excited state the cross section of the reaction d(n,γ) is suppressed because of a strong prohibition of M1-transition to the triton ground state. While the hypothesis about similarity of the structure of the excited state of the 3H nucleus to that of the ground one of the 6He nucleus naturally explains the sensitivity of the cross section of the reaction H(6He,α) to this state found out in Ref. [\cite=1].

The main conclusion is one should follow the energy dependence of the wave functions of the inelastic channels that are close on structure to the configuration ([\ref=1]) in the consistent three-body calculation of nd-scattering. An estimate of the possibility of triton excitation in an inelastic electron scattering due to E0-transition and an expansion of the analysis on the system p+  d and 3He nucleus are of the obvious interest.
