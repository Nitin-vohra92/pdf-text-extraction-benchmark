In the quest of understanding physics at energy scales beyond that of the standard model (SM), many ideas have been discussed rather extensively in the literature. Two of the most popular, and in some sense intertwined, theories are those of grand unification and supersymmetry. In both theories, there arise new particles that connect the quark and lepton sectors. Such a particle can either be a scalar or a vector. In this letter, we shall restrict ourselves to scalars. As for weak SU(2) properties, it can transform either as a singlet, a doublet or a triplet.

In grand unified theories [\cite=gut], where quarks and leptons are part of the same multiplet, there naturally arise scalar leptoquarks leading to a contact interaction between a quark and a lepton. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [\cite=mssm] too, the squarks may mediate interactions between quarks and leptons unless some extra symmetry (R-parity) is imposed on the theory. As there is no deep motivation for such a symmetry to actually exist, it is interesting to examine the possible consequences of such R-parity violating ([formula]) interaction. Within the context of the MSSM, the part of the Lagrangian violating R-parity may be written in terms of the chiral superfields as

[formula]

where Li and Qi are the SU(2) doublet lepton and quark fields and Eci,Uci,Dci are the singlet superfields. Concentrating on the λ'ijk piece above, it is obvious that the phenomenology due to such terms is very similar to that of certain scalar leptoquarks.

A generic scalar coupling between a lepton (l) and a quark (q) can be parametrized as

[formula]

where g is the weak gauge coupling constant, lc is the charge conjugate field and PL,R  =  (1  ∓  γ5) / 2 (φ and φ' are independent fields). Since diquark couplings violate baryon number, non-observation of proton decay forbids the simultaneous presence of diquark couplings as well. Furthermore, to suppress flavour-changing neutral current processes [\cite=leurer], each such scalar is assumed to couple primarily to only one family of quarks (leptons). Finally, to survive stringent bounds coming from helicity suppressed π  →  eν and similar processes [\cite=shank], the scalar coupling is assumed to be chiral (i.e. it is not allowed to simultaneously couple to the left- and right-handed quarks). There is a subtlety in the case of the MSSM as the squarks L and R will always mix. One may argue that such effects are proportional to mf / mSUSY and hence would be small in most cases including the one that we are about to discuss. Still, the existence of this mixing does affect some rare processes, and, as a result, the bounds [\cite=barger] on [formula]  couplings are somewhat stronger than those for a chirally coupling leptoquark. With the above assumptions then, there are only five possible scalar couplings involving a charged lepton and these are listed in Table [\ref=table]. We have grouped scalars with different [formula] properties together as their gauge interactions are irrelevant for the processes that we intend to study.

Leptoquark couplings as well as [formula] couplings are constrained by direct searches at various colliders [\cite=collider]. The Fermilab CDF [\cite=cdflq] and D0 [\cite=d0lq] experiments rule out a 'first generation scalar' upto ~  100 GeV, almost irrespective of the size of the Yukawa couplings. On the other hand, the HERA collaboration sets a limit of ~  180 GeV [\cite=hera] on the mass of a scalar coupling with electroweak strength to a first generation quark and electron. Similar bounds also hold for the [formula] case. Due to the presence of other decay channels for the squarks, the exact constraints are somewhat different[\cite=butter]. For example, the Tevatron dilepton [\cite=dp] data have been used to set lower limits on squark/gluino masses for almost any value of the [formula] coupling. For scalars coupling to the third generation, the bounds are understandably weaker. The strongest constraints to date can be inferred from the loop effects on the leptonic partial widths of the Z [\cite=bes]. Stronger constraints on such scalars can be obtained in future colliders by looking either at τ-number violating processes [\cite=probir] at LEP200 or at t production [\cite=dc] at the Next Linear Collider.

It is obvious that such experiments (other than those at HERA) have very little to say about the Yukawa couplings per. se. In this letter, we point out an experiment that would do so. To do this, we investigate the possibility of identifying the effects of a virtual scalar exchange in dilepton production in hadronic reactions. The signature we focus on is a lepton pair without any missing transverse momentum. The lowest order SM process leading to such a final state is the Drell-Yan mechanism i.e. [formula]. The presence of such a scalar would introduce an additional t-channel diagram, an obvious consequence being a modification of the total cross section [\cite=rz]. A more sensitive probe, though, could be a comparison of the differential distributions. Owing to the extra diagram being a t-channel one in contrast to the s-channel SM contribution, it is conceivable that the effect of the former would be more pronounced for certain phase space configurations.

A particular distribution viz. the rapidity dependence suggests itself. In the subprocess centre-of-mass (c.m.) frame, one expects the t-channel contribution to be more central than the s-channel one. Another differential variable of interest could be the invariant mass of the lepton pair. Indeed, the CDF collaboration has studied the latter distribution for both dielectron and dimuon pairs [\cite=cdfdy]. In the first part of this letter, we show how this experiment can discriminate between the SM and a theory with an extra scalar interaction. We compare the theoretical predictions with the existing data and point out the improvements necessary to make our conclusions more quantitative. In the second part, we examine the same effect for the LHC, and speculate on the sensitivity that can be achieved.

In principle, the contribution of a scalar of the type φ' (see eq. ([\ref=generic_Lagrangian])) can be distinguished from that of type φ only if (i) the colliding beams are asymmetric and (ii) the individual lepton charges are distinguished. We shall not dwell upon this possibility here. We make the simplifying assumption that at best one of the scalars in Table [\ref=table] is present. As an example, we present here the differential cross section for the process q  →  l+l- for the case hR  =  0, hL  ≠  0. This corresponds to scalars of Types III, IV or V in Table 1. (The expressions for the other types of scalars can be obtained by simple modifications of the couplings.) Defining the left- and right-handed couplings of the Z to a fermion (f) by

[formula]

where ef and tf3 are the corresponding charge and isospin respectively and θW is the weak mixing angle, we have, for a scalar of mass mφ:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and M is the invariant mass of the l+l- pair. The QCD corrections to the Drell-Yan process have been calculated [\cite=QCD] to the next-to-leading order and is a function of the c.m. energy ([formula]) of the collider, the structure functions used and the subprocess scale M. For [formula] GeV, the dependence on M is marginal and one may approximate it by a scale-independent constant. In the absence of an explicit calculation of the higher-order effects, we assume that the QCD correction for the t-channel scalar exchange process is the same as that for the Drell-Yan process. One may argue that in the presence of scalars, these corrections are likely to be even larger.

To obtain the cross section for a hadronic collision AB  →  l+l-X, we have to convolute the expression in eq. ([\ref=dsig]) with the parton distributions. For example, the invariant mass distribution is given by

[formula]

where x is the fraction of the momentum of A carried by qA. While the sum in eq.([\ref=convolution]) runs over all species of quarks for the SM piece, for the scalar contribution it runs only over those quarks with which the scalar couples. For the rest of this analysis, we shall concentrate only on those that couple to one or both of the first generation quarks. We use the MRSD-' structure functions [\cite=mrs] evaluated at the scale Q2  =  M2. For this choice, the QCD K-factor ≃1.3(1.1) for [formula] TeV.

The CDF collaboration at Fermilab measures the Drell-Yan cross section [\cite=cdfdy] dσ / dM in the range 11  <  M  <  150 GeV. They restrict their measurements to |η±|  ≤  1, where η± are the pseudorapidities of e± respectively. Furthermore, the numbers quoted are averaged over the rapidity of the lepton pair. For ease of comparison, we shall consider the same distribution (including the actual binning for M as used in the experiment). In Fig. [\ref=cdffig], we compare the experimental data with the theoretical curves for the SM, and those for scalars of Type IVa (see Table [\ref=table]). We have set here hL  =  1, i.e. the Yukawa coupling is of the electroweak strength. Though the effect of the scalar starts becoming visible at around M≃65 GeV, it is immediately swamped by the Z-pole. At large M values though, the deviation is significant and information about scalars may be extracted. However, as even a cursory glance at the figure would reveal, the data at present are rather poor and any quantitative statement would be premature. We rather wish to point out that a refinement of measurement at the high invariant mass end ([formula] GeV) of the spectrum (along with an increase of luminosity at the possible Tevatron upgrade) would enhance considerably the ability to detect such scalar particles.

We now turn to the LHC. Due to the large operating energy (14 TeV) one would expect to see a more pronounced effect. In our analysis, we assume an integrated luminosity of 100 fb- 1. In Fig. [\ref=massdistrib], we first compare the invariant mass distribution for different masses of a Type IVa scalar (hL  =  1) with that for the SM. We use kinematic cuts of |η±|  ≤  3, numbers that have often been quoted. As is expected, the effect of the scalar exchange is more pronounced for large M. Due to the much larger energy available (and partly due to the wider angular coverage), the presence of much heavier scalars can be detected.

The information in Fig. [\ref=massdistrib] can be used to put bounds on the two-parameter space (mφ, h) -- here [formula], as the case may be -- that can be achieved at the LHC. It is obvious that imposing an acceptability cut on the invariant mass would enhance the effect of the scalar. In our analysis, we arbitrarily set M min  =  500 GeV. Denoting the number of events expected in the SM, and in a theory with such a scalar by nSM and nφ respectively, we demand that

[formula]

for the effect to be considered visible. This allows us to draw contours in the mφ-h plane (Fig. [\ref=mvsk]) for various types of scalars. The region of the parameter space above the respective curves can then be ruled out at the 3σ level. The difference in the sensitivity to the scalar type is a consequence of the difference in their coupling, as also of the relative abundance of various quarks in the proton. While it is true that a 2.5 TeV scalar may easily be pair produced at the LHC, such an event would afford us no handle on its couplings to the SM fermions. Indeed, the bounds presented here are the strongest that can be achieved on leptoquark couplings in the near future. For the [formula] case, this is illustrated even better. As we have pointed out right at the beginning, the low energy constraints on [formula] couplings are stronger than those for the usual leptoquarks. For our interaction, [formula] is phenomenologically identical to a case where both Type II a and Type III scalars are present, with the contributions adding incoherently. If we assume the two squarks (ũL and d̃R) to be mass-degenerate, the bound on the [formula] coupling lies in between the two above curves, and is somewhat weaker than those derived from low energy processes [\cite=barger]. One should realise though that this experiment provides an independent constraint on the parameter space for the theory. Interestingly, in the extreme case of m(d̃R)  ≫  m(ũL), the low energy constraint becomes relatively unimportant and the experiment discussed here would provide the strongest constraints. Indeed, for all such scalars except that of Type III, dilepton data at the LHC would lead to bounds significantly stronger than those obtained from low energy processes such as π-decay, charge-current-universality etc.

As we had mentioned, our choice of M min was rather arbitrary. The exact value that should be adopted to maximize the effect is dependent on the value of mφ that one aims to probe. On the face of it, a larger value of M min should serve to eliminate more of the SM contribution. This advantage can, however, be nullified by the consequent loss of statistics. In fact, a larger M min is more useful for exploring larger mφ. To illustrate our point, we superimpose the 3σ contours for two different values of M min in Fig. [\ref=m_min].

Until now, we have neglected the other interesting dynamical variable in the process, namely the difference (Δη  =  η+  -  η-) of the lepton rapidities. Since this is nothing but the scattering angle in the subprocess c.m. frame, one expects to see the difference between an s-channel and a t-channel process. This is borne out strikingly in Fig. [\ref=rapdistrib]. We would like to point out that instead of comparing the integrated cross section, much more information can be gleaned from a study of the differential distribution d2σ  /  dM dΔη. This can be done, at a quantitative level, by performing a χ2 test. We refrain from doing so, however, as such an analysis presumes some knowledge of the detector. We prefer instead, to only point out that once the detector parameters are well understood, such an analysis should be undertaken so as to improve the sensitivity of the experiment.

In summary, we have examined the virtual effect of a t-channel scalar exchange in dielectron production at CDF and tried to foresee its possible impact at the LHC. In contrast to the pair production mechanism, the virtual effects are very sensitive to its Yukawa coupling. We point out that a few precise measurements of the dilepton distribution at CDF at higher invariant masses (M  ~  150 GeV) would allow us to probe the existence of a scalar of mass upto a few hundred GeV and coupling the electron and a first generation quark with electroweak strength. Similarly, at the LHC, we observe the possibility of probing scalar masses upto (1-3) TeV for a Yukawa coupling of electroweak strength. These estimates are significantly better than the bounds inferred from analyses of low-energy processes. We would also like to point out that such an analysis can as easily be done for a dimuon pair, and the bounds would be similar. For a τ+τ- pair, the situation would be a bit more complicated as τ-identification efficiency is likely to be lower. If this efficiency could be raised, such an experiment would lead to a significant improvement in constraints on such scalars coupling a τ to a quark. Finally, one may also investigate possible couplings of leptons to the heavier quarks, although these bounds would be weaker on account of the lower densities within the proton.
