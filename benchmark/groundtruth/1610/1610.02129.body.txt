Alternative proof of Keith-Zhong self-improvement

Introduction

Our goal is to reprove a result by Keith and Zhong on the self-improvement of Poincaré inequalities [\cite=keith2008poincare]. See also the detailed quantitative presentation in [\cite=heinonensobolev]. While the original proof is very beautiful and lends it's self for broad applications, there are a few reasons why we want to present an alternative argument. Firstly, the original proof is somewhat non-intuitive. It proceeds by an abstract argument estimating distributions of certain maximal functions, where the relationships between different estimates is only revealed at the very end. Further, we have worked on more general applications of these methods, and there much of the machinery of the original proof becomes unnecessary [\cite=poincare]. We would like to have a plain and simple proof that exposes the crucial ideas and steps. We hope this note serves this purpose.

To state the result, we will need the following terminology. For simplicity we will consistently work with a proper, geodesic metric measure space (X,d,μ) with a locally finite measure, i.e. μ(B(x,r)) <   ∞   for all open balls B(x,r)  ⊂  X. By discussion in [\cite=keith2008poincare] this is sufficient.

A proper metric measure space (X,d,μ) with a Radon measure μ is said to be D-doubling if for all 0 < r and any x∈X we have

[formula]

A proper metric measure space (X,d,μ) with a Radon measure μ and [formula] is said to satisfy a local (1,p)-Poincaré inequality (with constant CPI), for 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  , if for all Lipschitz functions f and all x∈X,0 < r we have for all B = B(x,r)

[formula]

We denote

[formula]

This inequality could be expressed in different generalities, but we choose this simple expression as it is sufficient. For a detailed discussion of these issues we refer to [\cite=keith2003modulus] [\cite=hajlasz1995sobolev] [\cite=Heinonen2000].

By the Hölder-inequality we can see that a smaller p gives a stronger inequality. Thus the main result is called a self-improvement result. For a more detailed discussion of the background and motivation we refer to [\cite=keith2008poincare] [\cite=poincare]

(Main Theorem) Let (X,d,μ) be a D-doubling geodesic space with a (1,p)-Poincaré inequality with constant CPI. There exists a ε(D,p,CPI) such that for any 0 < ε  <  ε(D,p,CPI), such that it also admits a (1,p - ε)-Poincaré inequality with constant CPI' = CPI'(D,p,CPI,ε).

By assuming D > 1000, we can use as bounds

[formula]

and

[formula]

Preliminary lemmas

We first need a few of the abstract lemmas used in [\cite=keith2008poincare]. Similar arguments are quite classical, see e.g. [\cite=Heinonen2000] and [\cite=heinonensobolev].

Let k  ≥  5. If (X,d,μ) is a D doubling metric measure space that is also a geodesic length space and f is a Lipschitz function, and for a fixed ball B(x,r) we have

[formula]

If further v,w∈B(x,r) are such that for any ball B(z,s) with z∈B(x,r) and [formula] such that v∈B(z,s) or w∈B(z,s) we have

[formula]

then

[formula]

Proof: There are two cases [formula] and [formula]. In the first case define Bi = B(x,d(x,y)21 - i) for i  ≥  0, and Bi = B(y,d(x,y)2i) for i  ≤   - 1. Let ri be the radius of Bi. Since the space is geodesic the intersection [formula] always contains a ball of radius [formula]. We get by the assumption and doubling that

[formula]

Thus by a telescoping argument and continuity.

[formula]

If d(x,y)  >  r / (2k), define B0  =  B(z,r), and Bi = B(x,r21 - i / k) for i  ≥  1, and Bi = B(y,r2- i - 1 / k) for i  ≤   - 1. Denote by ri the radius of Bi. Since we are in a geodesic metric space, there is always a ball of radius [formula] in [formula]. Again we get

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

[formula]

If (X,d,μ) is a D doubling metric measure space and f is a locally integrable function, and B = B(x,r). Then for any [formula]

[formula]

Proof: We have by twice applying the triangle inequality.

[formula]

[formula]

We will also use A standard covering theorem from harmonic analysis, that are standard [\cite=stein2016harmonic] [\cite=federer].

(Vitali covering theorem) Let X be a metric space, E  ⊂  X a subset and B be a collection of balls B(xi,ri) for i∈I for some index set I (possibly uncountable) and 0 < ri < D for a fixed D > 0 and all i∈I. Assume that they cover E:

[formula]

Then there exists a sub-collection B'  ⊂  B of disjoint balls, i.e. [formula] for any B,B'∈B' if B  ≠  B', and

[formula]

Here if B(x,r) is a ball, we denote by CB(x,r) = B(x,Cr).

Proof of Keith-Zhong result

We will rephrase the argument in [\cite=keith2008poincare] as a proof by induction on scales. For oscillations comparable to [formula] the result is trivial. Further if the oscillations in a given ball are comparable to [formula] for some n  ≥  1 we use a dichotomy. Either the oscillations are caused by larger oscillations over a significant portion of the set, or on most scales and locations the oscillations are small. In the first case the result follows since we already have established a Poincaré inequality when oscillations are larger. In the second case we are able to cut off the high oscillations and obtain a Poincaré inequality by applying a better Lipschitz estimate obtained from Lemma [\ref=lipextend]. One of the main advantages of our approach is that the proof we get is significantly shorter, and also avoids a non-trivial and technical extension theorem used in [\cite=keith2008poincare].

(Main Theorem) Let (X,d,μ) be a D-doubling geodesic space with a (1,p)-Poincaré inequality with constant CPI. There exists a ε(D,p,CPI) such that for any 0 < ε  <  ε(D,p,CPI), such that it also admits a (1,p - ε)-Poincaré inequality with constant CPI' = CPI'(D,p,CPI,ε).

Proof: Assume the Poincaré inequality in the following form

[formula]

Our argument will proceed inductively down from the scale of [formula]. Consider fixed parameters M > 1,C'PI,N > 1 and fix q < p close enough to p, which are chosen to satisfy inequalities determined below. We will aim to prove

[formula]

Notice that we enlarge the ball on the right by a factor of ten. From this the result can be obtained by applying a result from [\cite=hajlasz1995sobolev] [\cite=keith2003modulus]. We will prove the result by induction on the scale of oscillation. Thus consider the following proposition, which consists of the same inequality but with an additional constraint. We need to show for every non-negative integer n the following statement.

[formula]

For simplicity scale [formula], and denote

[formula]

Base case n = 0, i.e. P0: We have

[formula]

Using the Poincaré inequality we get

[formula]

Further we get by the Lipschitz bound [formula]:

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

If CPI'  ≥  Mp / qCp / qPI the desired inequality follows.

Assume Pk for k  <  n and show Pn: We are assuming that

[formula]

Our main argument is that either significantly larger oscillations occur at a significant portion of the measure or they can be cut off. First we define rigorously what we mean by the set of large oscillations. Fix K = 2D6 and an integer N. For each [formula] define BN to be the set of balls B(xj,rNj) with the following properties.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Define the set of large oscillation as:

[formula]

There are two cases, either one of the μ(UN) is large or all of them are small, relative to the size of μ(B(x,r)). Start with assuming that the size is above a certain threshold.

Case for some [formula] we have μ(Ui)  ≥  D3KM- qiμ(B): By Theorem [\ref=vitali] we can cover U by balls B(xj,50rj) with i∈I', such that B(xj,rj)∈BN and B(xj,10rj)  ⊂  B(x,10r) are disjoint. We get

[formula]

By the induction hypothesis for each j∈I'

[formula]

But also by disjointness

[formula]

Finally combining these estimates with doubling we get the following.

[formula]

Recall our choice of K = 2D6, which was used on the last line.

[formula]

Case μ(Ui)  <  D3KM- qiμ(B(x,r)) for all [formula]: First a Lipschitz bound. For any [formula] and any ball B(z,s) containing x with 0 < s  ≤  r / 5 and z∈B(x,2r) we have

[formula]

Thus if we define [formula] we have by Lemma [\ref=lipextend] that fi is 16D7M- n - 1 + i-Lipschitz on [formula]. We can extend fi to [formula] be 16D7M- n - 1 + i-Lipschitz on all of X. Further we have [formula]. We define an average of these functions by

[formula]

Then [formula], and

[formula]

Assume M  ≥  2, so a geometric sum can be estimated by twice the largest term. Integrating over B(x,2r), using the assumption and noting Ui  ⊂  Uj for i > j:

[formula]

On the first line we used the estimate μ(Ui)  <  D3KM- qiμ(B(x,r)) . On the first and last line we used the fact that [formula]. Since [formula] is 16D7M- n-Lipschitz we get [formula] almost everywhere on [formula].

Note that as N is fixed large and q is chosen very close to p, the second term can be made very small. This will allow us to estimate from below the oscillations of f. To show that h has large oscillations we will prove that outside of U1 there are still large oscillations of h. In other words we will prove

[formula]

Assume for simplicity that [formula]. Using again theorem [\ref=vitali] we can cover [formula] with balls Ei = B(xi,5ri)  ⊂  B(x,2r) such that B(xi,ri) are disjoint, [formula] and [formula]. This is possible by continuity of measure and because for any y∈B(x,2r) and any [formula] we have

[formula]

Choosing M such that Mq > 4KD10 = 8D16, which occurs when

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

and B(y,s) is not in the cover. On the other hand U1 is open, so for any y∈U1 we have a s small enough with

[formula]

By continuity of the measure in s there exists an s with the desired equality

[formula]

Define [formula]. Since [formula] and by the definition of U1, we have

[formula]

Using doubling, the covering properties and Lemma [\ref=average] we get the following.

[formula]

Assume next 16D9KM- q - n < M- n - 1. This is possible if q > 1 and

[formula]

Thus we can absorb the first term on the bottom row to the left hand side and obtain the following

[formula]

which gives the desired estimate

[formula]

Assuming [formula], we get for [formula]

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

By the (1,p)-PI inequality

[formula]

Combining this with the estimate for [formula] we get

[formula]

If

[formula]

we can absorb the second term to the left hand side. This can be attained by first fixing N large, and then taking q very close to p. See the discussion after the proof for exact bounds. Using this we get

[formula]

Moving term around we get

[formula]

If

[formula]

the result follows.

[formula]

We have five inequalities that need to be satisfied for the aforementioned proof. First three inequalities for M:

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Setting K = 2D6, we can set

[formula]

Thus a simple bound would be [formula]. Since p > 1 we can assume q - 1 > γ = (p - 1) / 2, and set [formula] Now that we have fixed K and M, we need to fix N and q in order to get

[formula]

First chose N = 2105D25CPI. Then

[formula]

In particular then the desired inequality will follow if

[formula]

This is possible if [formula] In other words [formula]. In other words in the theorem we can bound

[formula]

This depends on p only implicitly via γ  ~  q - 1  ~  p - 1. For p larger, more self-improvement can be gained. This is to be expected.

Then there are two inequalities for CPI':

[formula]

[formula]

Taking a maximum of these two gives a somewhat unwieldy bound for CPI', which we now will simplify by a very rough estimate. These bounds seem more transparent than the ones in [\cite=heinonensobolev]. If we assume D > 1000, we can set [formula], [formula] and finally since p / q  <  2, we can take

[formula]

This bound is very rough, but the asymptotics in terms of CPI seem accurate, and in terms of D the power is most likely not optimal.
