Equationally extremal semilattices

Introduction

In the current paper we study equations over finite semilattices. Let [formula] denote the class of all semilattices of order n. The class [formula] contains extremal semilattices relative to their equational properties. For example, [formula] contains a semilattice S with a maximal (minimal) number of consistent equations.

Below we study such extremal semilattices from [formula]. In Theorem [\ref=th:1] we find a semilattice with a maximal (minimal) number of consistent equations. The semilattice found is isomorphic to the linearly ordered semilattice (to the fan semilattice, respectively). In Theorem [\ref=th:2] we prove that the fan semilattice has a maximal value of

[formula]

where [formula] iterates the set of all equations in one variable. Unfortunately, the corresponding semilattice with a minimal sum is not found yet. We can only formulate the following conjecture

Conjecture. Let Σ(S) has the minimum value Σ in the set [formula]. Then there exists a semilattice [formula] with a unique co-atom such that Σ(S1) = Σ.

We discuss this conjecture in Section [\ref=sec:discuss]

Basic notions

Let S be a semilattice of order n, where the meet operation is denoted by ·   and the minimal element is denoted by 0. The partial order over a semilattice S is defined by ·   as follows

[formula]

Moreover, we assume that any semilattice below contains the maximal element 1. This assumption is not strict, since one can adjoint 1 to any semilattice with no maximal element. An element s∈S is called an atom (co-atom) if there is not an element t∈S with 0 < t < s (respectively, s < t < 1). The set of all atoms of a semilattice S is denoted by [formula]. Let [formula] denote the set of all ancestors of an element s∈S, i.e.

[formula]

Let S be a semilattice and [formula] a variable set. An equation over S is an ordered pair (t(X)s1,s(X)s2) or (t(X)s1,s2), where t(X),s(X) are nonempty products of variables of X and si∈S. Below we shall write equations in traditional form: t(X)s1 = s(X)s2, t(X)s1 = s2.

Let us give some remarks about the set of equations over S:

Since an equation is an ordered pair, the expressions t(X)s1 = s(X)s2, s(X)s2 = t(X)s1 are assumed to be different equations.

Formally, the expression s1 = t(X)s2 is not an equation over S, but t(X)s2 = s1 is.

Since 1∈S, the following expressions t(X)s1 = s(X), t(X) = s(X)s2, t(X) = s(X), t(X) = s2 are equations over S.

An equation of the form t(X)s1 = s(X)s2 (t(X)s1 = s2) is called an equation of the first (respectively, second) kind. Let [formula] denote the set of all equations of the i-th kind in at most m variables over a semilattice S.

Let [formula] be the set of all equations in at most m variables over a semilattice S. For a semilattice S of order n one can directly compute that [formula], [formula], and finally

[formula]

Two series of semilattices

Let [formula] be the linearly ordered semilattice of order n (n  ≥  2). The order over Ln is given by

[formula]

Let [formula] be the semilattice consisting of n (n  ≥  3) elements, and An  =  {ai|1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 2} is an anti-chain.

Inconsistent equations

In [\cite=shevl_random_semilattices] it was described extremal semilattices of order n with minimal (maximal) number of inconsistent equations. Let [formula] be the set of all inconsistent equations over a semilattice S in at most m variables

[\cite=shevl_random_semilattices] For any semilattice S of order n it holds

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover, in [\cite=shevl_random_semilattices] it was proved that the empty set is most probable in a random generation of equations. More formally, let [formula] be the set of all equations with the solution set Y  ⊆  S, and we have the following statement.

[\cite=shevl_random_semilattices] For any semilattice S of order n  ≥  6 and any algebraic subset Y  ⊆  S it holds

[formula]

Number of all solutions

Let us consider an expression

[formula]

where an equation [formula] iterates the set of all equations in one variable, and find a semilattice with minimal (maximal) value of Σ(S). Firstly, one can directly show that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

For any element s of a semilattice S with |S| = n it holds

[formula]

Proof. An equation xa = b of the second kind is satisfied by s iff b = as. Therefore the right part of the equation is determined by a constant a of the left part. Since a belongs to the n-element set S, there are exactly n equations in [formula]. [formula]

Thus, [formula] and below we study only the set [formula]. Let

[formula]

For any semilattice S of the order n we have

[formula]

[formula]

for any s∈S

[formula]

if [formula], and

[formula]

if [formula];

for any s  ≤  t it holds

[formula]

if [formula] then

[formula]

[formula]

Proof.

The proof is straightforward.

We prove only ([\ref=eq:cov_1(many_anc)]), since the proof of ([\ref=eq:cov_1(one_anc)]) is straightforward. If [formula] then

[formula]

for any [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Let us prove the converse inclusion. Suppose [formula] but [formula]. Then there exist [formula] such that sa  ≤  t1, [formula]. The equalities [formula] imply

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

[formula]

and we obtain a contradiction [formula].

Directly follows from the previous statement.

The statement immediately follows from formulas ([\ref=eq:cov_1(0)],[\ref=eq:cov_1(one_anc)]), since [formula] for any atom s.[formula]

The following lemmas contain results about the sets [formula] in semilattices Ln,Fn.

For each s∈Ln we have

[formula]

[formula]

For each s∈Fn, n  ≥  4 we have

[formula]

[formula]

For any semilattice S of order n  ≥  4 we have

[formula]

Proof. It is clear that for any [formula] we have

[formula]

Suppose S contains at least two atoms then for each atom a we have

[formula]

and ([\ref=eq:|cov_1(atom)|]) gives

[formula]

for each [formula].

By ([\ref=eq:monotonicity]), for each [formula] it holds

[formula]

and, using ([\ref=eq:cov_1(0)],[\ref=eq:cov_1(1)],[\ref=eq:cov_1(s)_over_F_n]), we have

[formula]

Suppose now that S has exactly one atom a. Then ([\ref=eq:cov_1(atom)]) gives

[formula]

Let us prove the inequality

[formula]

for each [formula]. We have exactly two cases.

Indeed, if a has a unique descendant [formula] (i.e. [formula]) one can directly compute that

[formula]

and, using ([\ref=eq:monotonicity]), we obtain ([\ref=eqq:aaaaaaaaaaa]).

Suppose a is the ancestor of [formula] (k  ≥  2). Then one can compute that

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

We have

[formula]

(since [formula] and [formula] for j  ≠  i),

[formula]

(since [formula] for j  ≠  i, and [formula]). Since [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

By ([\ref=eqq:uparrow]-[\ref=eqq:leq_n-1]), one can directly compute that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

For n  ≥  4 the inequality n2 - 6n + 14  ≤  (n - 2)2 + 2 holds, and we obtain ([\ref=eqq:aaaaaaaaaaa]).

Using ([\ref=eq:cov_1(0)],[\ref=eq:cov_1(1)],[\ref=eqq:atom_a],[\ref=eqq:aaaaaaaaaaa]), we obtain

[formula]

that concludes the theorem. [formula]

Discussing the conjecture

In Introduction we mentioned the following conjecture.

Conjecture. Let Σ(S) has the minimum value Σ on the set [formula]. Then there exists a semilattice [formula] with a unique co-atom and Σ(S1) = Σ.

Surprisingly, the linearly ordered semilattice Ln has not the minimal value Σ(S) in [formula]. For example, Σ(S) has the minimum at the following semilattice S5 in [formula].

Fig.2

(the number at each vertex s is [formula]), but the linearly ordered semilattice L5 has the following values of [formula]

Fig.3

We have

[formula]

Using a computer, we checked the conjecture for each n∈[4,10].
