Introduction

One of the most wonderful discoveries in one variable operator theory is the canonical decomposition of a contraction which ascertains that every contraction operator (i.e, an operator with norm not greater than 1) admits a unique decomposition into two orthogonal parts of which one is a unitary and the other is a completely non-unitary. More precisely, for an operator T with norm not greater than one acting on a Hilbert space H, there exist unique reducing subspaces H1,H2 of T such that [formula], T|H1 is a unitary and T|H2 is a completely non-unitary (see Theorem 3.2 in Ch-I, [\cite=nagy] for details). An operator on a Hilbert space is completely non-unitary if there is no reducing subspace on which the operator acts like a unitary. Following von Neumann's famous notion of spectral set for an operator (which we define below), a contraction is better understood as an operator having the closed unit disk of the complex plane [formula] as a spectral set. Indeed, in 1951 von Neumann proved the following theorem whose impact has been extraordinary.

An operator T acting on a Hilbert space is a contraction if and only if the closed unit disk [formula] is a spectral set for T.

Since an operator having [formula] as a spectral set admits a canonical decomposition, it is naturally asked whether we can decompose operators having a particular domain in [formula] as a spectral set. In [\cite=ay-jot], Agler and Young answered this question by showing an explicit decomposition of a pair of commuting operators having the closed symmetrized bidisc

[formula]

as a spectral set (Theorem 2.8, [\cite=ay-jot]). In this article, we provide an analogous decomposition for operators having the closed symmetrized tridisc

[formula]

as a spectral set. The reason behind considering the symmetrized polydisc of dimension 3 in particular is that there are substantial variations in operator theory if we move from two to three dimensional symmetrized polydisc, e.g., rational dilation succeeds on the symmetrized bidisc [\cite=ay-jfa] [\cite=tirtha-sourav] [\cite=sourav] but fails on the symmetrized tridisc, [\cite=sourav1]. This article can be considered as a sequel of [\cite=sourav1].

A compact subset X of [formula] is said to be a spectral set for a commuting n-tuple of bounded operators [formula] defined on a Hilbert space H if the Taylor joint spectrum σT() of [formula] is a subset of X and

[formula]

for all rational functions f in R(X). Here R(X) denotes the algebra of all rational functions on X, that is, all quotients p / q of holomorphic polynomials p,q in n-variables for which q has no zeros in X.

For n  ≥  2, the symmetrization map in n-complex variables [formula] is the following proper holomorphic map

[formula]

where

[formula]

The closed symmetrized n-disk (or simply closed symmetrized polydisc) is the image of the closed unit n-disc [formula] under the symmetrization map πn, that is, [formula]. Similarly the open symmetrized polydisc [formula] is defined as the image of the open unit polydisc [formula] under πn. The set Γn is polynomially convex but not convex (see [\cite=edi-zwo] [\cite=BSR]). So in particular the closed and open symmetrized tridisc are the sets

[formula]

We obtain from the literature (see [\cite=edi-zwo] [\cite=BSR]) that the distinguished boundary of the symmetrized polydisc is the symmetrization of the distinguished boundary of the n-dimensional polydisc, which is n-torus [formula]. Hence the distinguished boundary for Γ3 is the set

[formula]

Operator theory on the symmetrized polydiscs of dimension 2 and n have been extensively studied in past two decades [\cite=ay-jfa] [\cite=ay-jot] [\cite=AY] [\cite=tirtha-sourav] [\cite=tirtha-sourav1] [\cite=BSR] [\cite=sourav] [\cite=pal-shalit].

A triple of commuting operators (S1,S2,P) on a Hilbert space H for which Γ3 is a spectral set is called a Γ3-contraction. A Γ3-contraction (S1,S2,P) is said to a completely non-unitary if P is a completely non-unitary contraction.

It is evident from the definition that if (S1,S2,P) is a Γ3-contraction then S1,S2 have norms not greater than 3 and P is a contraction. Unitaries, isometries and co-isometries are important special classes of contractions. There are natural analogues of these classes for Γ3-contractions.

Let S1,S2,P be commuting operators on a Hilbert space H. We say that (S1,S2,P) is

a Γ3-unitary if S1,S2,P are normal operators and the Taylor joint spectrum σT(S1,S2,P) is contained in bΓ3 ;

a Γ3-isometry if there exists a Hilbert space K containing H and a Γ3-unitary (,,P̃) on K such that H is a common invariant subspace for ,,P̃ and that Si  =  |H for i = 1,2 and P̃|H = P;

a Γ3-co-isometry if (S*1,S*2,P*) is a Γ3-isometry.

Moreover, a Γ3-isometry (S1,S2,P) is said to be pure if P is a pure contraction, that is, P*  →  0 strongly as n  →    ∞  .

The main result of this article is the following explicit orthogonal decomposition of a Γ3-contraction which parallels the one-variable canonical decomposition.

Let (S1,S2,P) be a Γ3-contraction on a Hilbert space H. Let H1 be the maximal subspace of H which reduces P and on which P is unitary. Let [formula]. Then H1,H2 reduce S1,S2; (S1|H1,S2|H1,P|H1) is a Γ3-unitary and (S1|H2,S2|H2,P|H2) is a completely non-unitary Γ3-contraction. The subspaces H1 or H2 may equal to the trivial subspace {0}.

En route we find few characterizations for the set Γ3 and also for the Γ3-contractions which we accumulate in section 2.

Background material

In this section we recall some results from literature about the geometry and operator theory on the set Γ3. Also we obtain few new results in the same direction which we accumulate here. We begin with a few characterizations of the set Γ3.

Let [formula]. Then the following are equivalent:

(s1,s2,p)∈Γ3 ;

(ωs1,ωs2,ω2p)∈Γ3 for all [formula]  ;

|p|  ≤  1 and there exist complex numbers c1,c2 with |c1| + |c2|  ≤  3 such that s1 = c1  +  p and s2 = c2  +  p.

(1)⇔  (3) has been established in [\cite=costara1] and also independently in [\cite=sourav1] (see Theorem 3.4 in [\cite=sourav1] for a proof). We prove here (1)⇔  (2). Let (s1,s2,p)∈Γ3. Then by Theorem (1)⇔  (3), |p|  ≤  1 and there are complex numbers c1,c2 with |c1| + |c2|  ≤  3 such that

[formula]

For [formula] if we choose [formula] we see that |d1| + |d2|  ≤  3 and

[formula]

Therefore, by part (1)⇔  (3), (ωs1,ωs2,ω2p)∈Γ3. The other side of the proof is trivial.

In a similar fashion, we have the following characterizations for Γ3-contractions.

Let (S1,S2,P) be a triple of commuting operators acting on a Hilbert space H. Then the following are equivalent:

(S1,S2,P) is a Γ3-contraction ;

for all holomorphic polynomials f in three variables

[formula]

(ωS1,ωS2,ω2P) is a Γ3-contraction for any [formula].

(1)  ⇒  (2) follows from definition of spectral set and (2)  ⇒  (1) just requires polynomial convexity of the set Γ3. We prove here (1)  ⇒  (3) because (3)  ⇒  (1) is obvious. Let f(s1,s2,p) be a holomorphic polynomial in the co-ordinates of Γ3 and for [formula] let f1(s1,s2,p) = f(ωs1,ωs2,ω2p). It is evident from part (1)  ⇒  (2) that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Therefore, by (1)  ⇒  (2), (ωS1,ωS2,ω2P) is a Γ3-contraction.

In [\cite=sourav1], two operator pencils Φ1,  Φ2 were introduced which played pivotal role in determining the classes of Γ3-contractions for which rational dilation failed or succeeded. Here we recall the definition of Φ1,  φ2 for any three commuting operators S1,S2,P with [formula] and P being a contraction.

[formula]

The following result whose proof could be found in [\cite=sourav1] (Proposition 3.4 in [\cite=sourav1]) is useful for this paper.

Let (S1,S2,P) be a Γ3-contraction. Then for i = 1,2, Φi(αS1,αS2,α2P)  ≥  0 for all [formula].

Here is a set of characterizations for the Γ3-unitaries and for a proof of this result see Theorem 5.2 in [\cite=sourav1].

Let (S1,S2,P) be a commuting triple of bounded operators. Then the following are equivalent.

(S1,S2,P) is a Γ3-unitary,

P is a unitary and (S1,S2,P) is a Γ3-contraction,

[formula], P is a unitary and S1  =  S*2P.

The following result is a structure theorem for Γ3-isometries and for a proof see Theorem 5.4 in [\cite=sourav1].

Let (S1,S2,P) be a commuting triple of bounded operators. Then the following are equivalent.

(S1,S2,P) is a Γ3-isometry.

P is an isometry and (S1,S2,P) is a Γ3-contraction.

P is an isometry, S2 is a contraction and S1 = S*2P.

(Wold decomposition) H has a decomposition [formula] into reducing subspaces of S1,S2,P such that (S1|H1,S2|H1,P|H1) is a Γ3-unitary and (S1|H2,S2|H2,P|H2) is a pure Γ3-isometry.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:decomp]

First we consider the case when P is a completely non-unitary contraction. Then obviously H1  =  {0} and if P is a unitary then H  =  H1 and so H2  =  {0}. In such cases the theorem is trivial. So let us suppose that P is neither a unitary nor a completely non unitary contraction. With respect to the decomposition [formula], let

[formula]

so that P1 is a unitary and P2 is completely non-unitary. Since P2 is completely non-unitary it follows that if h∈H and

[formula]

then h = 0.

By the commutativity of S1 and P we obtain

[formula]

Also the commutativity of S2 and P gives

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=lem:3], we have for all [formula],

[formula]

Adding Φ1 and Φ2 we get

[formula]

that is

[formula]

for all [formula]. Since the matrix in the left hand side of ([\ref=eqn:5]) is self-adjoint, if we write ([\ref=eqn:5]) as

[formula]

then

[formula]

Since the left hand side of ([\ref=eqn:6]) is a positive semi-definite matrix for every ω and β, if we choose β = 1 and β =  - 1 respectively then consideration of the (1,1) block reveals that

[formula]

for all [formula]. Choosing ω  =    ±  1 we get

[formula]

and choosing ω  =    ±  i we get

[formula]

Therefore, from ([\ref=eqn:7]) and ([\ref=eqn:8]) we get

[formula]

where P1 is unitary. Similarly, we can show that

[formula]

Therefore, R = 0. Since (S1,S2,P) is an [formula]-contraction, [formula] and hence [formula] also. Therefore, by part-(3) of Theorem [\ref=thm:tu], (S111,S211,P1) is an Γ3-unitary.

Now we apply Proposition 1.3.2 of [\cite=bhatia] to the positive semi-definite matrix in the left hand side of ([\ref=eqn:6]). This Proposition states that if R,Q  ≥  0 then [formula] if and only if X = R1 / 2KQ1 / 2 for some contraction K.

Since R = 0, we have X = 0. Therefore,

[formula]

for all [formula]. Choosing β  =    ±  1 we get

[formula]

for all [formula]. With the choices ω = 1,i , this gives

[formula]

Therefore, we also have

[formula]

Similarly, we can prove that

[formula]

Thus, we have the following equations

[formula]

Thus from ([\ref=eqn:9]), S121 = S*212P1 and together with the first equation in ([\ref=eqn:2]), this implies that

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

From equations in ([\ref=eqn:3]) and ([\ref=eqn:11]) we have that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and so we have

[formula]

This shows that P2 is unitary on the range of S*212 which can never happen because P2 is completely non-unitary. Therefore, we must have S*212 = 0 and so S212 = 0. Similarly we can prove that S112 = 0. Also from ([\ref=eqn:9]), S121 = 0 and from ([\ref=eqn:10]), S221 = 0. Thus with respect to the decomposition [formula]

[formula]

So, H1 and H2 reduce S1 and S2. Also (S122,S222,P2), being the restriction of the [formula]-contraction (S1,S2,P) to the reducing subspace H2, is an Γ3-contraction. Since P2 is completely non-unitary, (S122,S222,P2) is a completely non-unitary Γ3-contraction.
