Extremal product-one free sequences in [formula]

Introduction

Given a finite group G written multiplicatively, the Zero-sum Problems study conditions to ensure that a given sequence in G has a non-empty subsequence with prescribed properties (such as length, repetitions, weights) such that the product of its elements, in some order, is equal to the identity of the group.

One of the first problem of this type is the remarkable Theorem of Erdös-Ginzburg-Ziv (see [\cite=EGZ]): Given 2n - 1 integers, it is possible to select n of them, such that their sum is divisible by n, or in group theory language, every sequence S with l  ≥  2n - 1 elements in a finite cyclic group of order n has a subsequence of length n, the product of whose n elements being the identity. In this theorem, the number 2n - 1 is the smallest integer with this property.

Traditionally, this class of problems have been extensively studied for abelian groups. We can see overviews of Zero-sum Theory for finite abelian groups in the surveys of Y. Caro [\cite=Car] and W. Gao and A. Geroldinger [\cite=GaGe].

An important type of Zero-sum Problem is to determine the Davenport constant of a finite group G (written multiplicatively): This constant, denoted by D(G), is the smallest positive integer d such that every sequence with d elements in G (repetition allowed) contains some subsequence such that the product of its terms in some order is 1.

For [formula], let [formula] denote the cyclic group of order n written multiplicatively. The Davenport constant is known for some groups, such as:

D(Cn)  =  n;

D(Cm  ×  Cn)  =  m  +  n  -  1 if m|n (J. Olson, [\cite=Ols2]);

[formula] (J. Olson, [\cite=Ols1]);

D(D2n)  =  n  +  1 where D2n is the Dihedral Group of order 2n(see [\cite=OlWh] and [\cite=ZhGa]);

[formula] where q  ≥  3 is a prime number and [formula] (J. Bass, [\cite=Bas]).

However, it is still open for most other groups.

By the definition of the Davenport constant, there exist sequences S of G with D(G)  -  1 elements that are free of product-1 subsequences, i.e, there exists [formula] sequence of G such that [formula] for every non empty subset [formula] . The Inverse Zero-sum Problems study the structure of these extremal sequences which are free of product-1 subsequences with some prescribed property. Some overviews on the inverse problems can be found in articles such as [\cite=GaGeSc], [\cite=Sch] and [\cite=GaGeGr].

The inverse problems associated to the Davenport constant are already solved for a few abelian groups. The following theorem resolves the issue for the group Cn.

Let S be a sequence in Cn free of product-1 subsequences, where n  ≥  3. Suppose that |S|  ≥  (n + 1) / 2. Then there exists some g∈S with multiplicity ≥  2|S|  -  n  +  1. In particular, if |S|  =  n  -  1  =  D(Cn)  -  1 then [formula], where g is a generator of Cn.

Observe that in the cyclic case, sequences free of product-1 subsequences contain an element repeated many times. It is natural to ask if this is true in a general case. Specifically, let us say that a given finite abelian group G has Property C if every maximal sequence S which is free of product-1 subsequences with at most exp (G) elements, i.e. the exponent of the group G, has the form

[formula]

for some subsequence T of S. The above theorem states that Cn has the Property C. It follows from a result of C. Reiher in [\cite=Rei] that C2p possesses Property C (see also [\cite=GaGeSc] and [\cite=GaGe3]). In [\cite=GaGeGr], W. Gao, A. Geroldinger and D. J. Grynkiewicz showed that this result is multiplicative, extending this result for C2n where n is a composite number. In [\cite=Sch2], W. A. Schmid discusses the case Cn  ×  Cm, where n|m. Not much is known about groups of rank ≥  3, only few specific cases (see, for example, [\cite=Sch2]).

A minimal zero sequence S in a finite abelian group G is a sequence such that the product of its elements is 1, but each proper subsequence is free of product-1 subsequences. In [\cite=GaGe2], W. Gao and A. Geroldinger showed that if |S|  =  D(G) then S contains some element g∈G with order [formula] for certain groups such as p-groups, cyclic groups, groups with rank two and groups that are the sum of two elementary p-groups. They also conjectured that the same conclusion holds for every finite abelian group.

Another type of inverse zero-sum problem, associated to the Erdös-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem, was proved by A. Bialostocki and P. Dierker in [\cite=BiDi]. They established that if S is a sequence in Cn with 2n  -  2 elements and S is free of product-1 subsequences with n elements, then

[formula]

for some g,h∈Cn with [formula].

In this article, we caracterize the maximal sequences which are free of product-1 subsequences for certain non-abelian groups and we show that these sequences have a property similar to Property C. Let q be a prime number, m  ≥  2 be a divisor of q - 1 and [formula] such that [formula]. Denote by [formula] the metacyclic group [formula] written multiplicatively, i.e., the group generated by x and y with relations:

[formula]

Specifically, we prove the following result:

Let q be a prime number, m  ≥  2 be a divisor of q - 1 and [formula] such that [formula], where (m,q)  ≠  (2,3). Let S be a sequence in the metacyclic group [formula] with m + q - 2 elements. The following statements are equivalent:

S is free of product-1 subsequences;

For some 1  ≤  t  ≤  q - 1, 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1 such that gcd (i,m)  =  1 and [formula],

[formula]

Notation

Let G be a finite group written multiplicatively and [formula] be a sequence of elements of G. Suppose that T is a subsequence of S, say [formula], where [formula] is a subset of [formula]. We say that T is a product-1 subsequence when

[formula]

for some permutation σ of [formula], and if there are no such product-1 subsequences then we say that S is free of product-1 subsequences.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are subsequences of S. Then

[formula] denotes the product of the elements in S in the order that they appear;

[formula], for 0  ≤  n  ≤  l - 1, denotes the product of the elements in S with a n-shift in the indices;

|S|  =  l denotes the length of the sequence S;

SS- 11 denotes the subsequence formed by the elements of S without the elements of S1;

[formula] denotes the intersection of the subsequences S1 and S2. In the case that [formula], we say that S1 and S2 are disjoint subsequences;

[formula] denotes the concatenation of S1 and S2;

[formula] denotes the concatenation of k identical copies of S's.

For the group [formula], let

H be the cyclic subgroup of order q generated by y;

[formula], where Ni: = xiH for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1.

From the definition of semi-direct product, [formula] and Cm≃[null].

Auxiliary results

In this section we present the auxiliary theorems and lemmas that we use throughout the paper. First, we need the definition of sum-set and product-set:

If X and Y are non-empty subsets of an abelian group G then the sum-set is defined by

[formula]

If G is a non-abelian group, written multiplicatively, then the product-set is defined by

[formula]

A very fundamental result on sum-sets is the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem, which gives a lower bound for the number of elements of a sum-set in [formula] depending on the cardinality of each set.

For q a prime number and for any r non-empty sets [formula],

[formula]

Looking at the inequality above in the case that r  =  2 we get |X  +  Y|  ≥   min {q,  |X|  +  |Y|  -  1}. A pair of subsets X,Y of [formula] is called a critical pair if the equality |X  +  Y|  =   min {q,  |X|  +  |Y|  -  1} occurs. The following theorem provides criteria for a pair [formula] to be a critical pair.

Let q be a prime number and let X,Y non-empty subsets of [formula]. Then

[formula]

if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

|X|  +  |Y|  >  q;

min {|X|,|Y|}  =  1;

|X  +  Y|  =  q  -  1 and [formula], where [formula];

X and Y are arithmetic progressions with the same common difference.

Notice that assertion (a) above is the only one giving the equality |X + Y|  =  q, that is, [formula]. Assertion (b) means that we just translate the set Y, supposing |X|  =  1. The non-trivial cases yielding a critical pair are (c) and (d).

Now, suppose that A is a sequence in [formula] and that A has no elements in the normal subgroup H, but that the product of its elements is in H. The next lemma shows that if A is minimal with these properties then it is possible to generate at least |A| distinct products in H, just shifting the order of the product.

Let [formula] be a sequence in [formula], where [formula], such that π(A)∈H but no subsequence of A has product in H. Then:

πn(A)∈H for every 0  ≤  n  ≤  l - 1;

πi(A)  ≠  πj(A) for every 0  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  l - 1.

Proof: This proof is contained in the proof of Lemma 14 in [\cite=Bas].

Throughout this paper, we deal with many expressions of the type [formula], where [formula]. The following lemma explains why we can assume without loss of generality that this kind of expression has a value different than 0 under a weak assumption.

Let [formula] be a sequence in [formula] with at least 2 distinct elements, say [formula]. Suppose that [formula]. Then

[formula]

In particular, if one of them is 0 modulo q then the other is not 0 modulo q.

Proof: Since at least two elements are distinct, there exists 0  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1 such that [formula] (assuming that the index of the coefficients are taken modulo m, i.e., a0  =  am). Since [formula], we may translate the coefficients by multiplying by s, therefore we may assume without loss of generality that i  =  0, i.e., [formula]. Now, if

[formula]

then

[formula]

a contradiction.

One of the assertions from Vosper's Theorem says that if X and Y are arithmetical progressions then X and Y form a critical pair. On the other hand, if [formula] then the set [formula] is a geometric progression. Since we have the freedom to choose the order of the products, it is expected to deal with critical pairs that are formed by geometric progressions. The following lemma shows under some conditions that, in [formula], an arithmetic progression can not be a geometric progression.

Let q  ≥  5 be a prime number, [formula] and 2  ≤  k  ≤  q - 1. Let

[formula]

be two sets of classes modulo q. Then A and B are not invariant by multiplication by s.

Proof: Since A and B are complementary in [formula], they are both s-invariants or not simultaneously. Suppose that they are s-invariants.

As 1  ·  s∈A and (q - 1)  ·  s∈B, we obtain 2  ≤  s  ≤   min {k - 1,q - k}, therefore we may assume without loss of generality k  -  1  ≤  q  -  k. So 2  ≤  s  ≤  k  -  1  ≤  (q  -  1) / 2. Let [formula] be the inverse of s modulo q. Since sj∈A for all [formula] and [formula], we obtain c∈A and [formula], thus c - 1∈A, which implies [formula]. But 1  -  s has a representative in B, which is a contradiction.

The next lemma gives both upper and lower bounds for the number of solutions [formula] of the equation [formula] when [formula] and [formula] are fixed. We use the upper bound to show that the set [formula] contains both quadratic and non-quadratic residues modulo q.

Let [formula] be a prime number, [formula] and N the number of solutions [formula] of [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof: Direct consequence of Theorem 5 page 103 in [\cite=IrRo].

Let [formula] be a prime number such that q  ≥  13 and let [formula] . Then there exist [formula] such that c  +  bw41 is a quadratic residue and c  +  bw42 is a non-quadratic residue.

Proof: Fix [formula] and denote by N the number of solutions of

[formula]

Let [formula] such that [formula]. Since each solution of equation ([\ref=equacaoabc]) generates seven other solutions (by switching z by - z and multiplying w by powers of w0), the number of elements in the set

[formula]

is at most N / 8. By the previous lemma, it follows that

[formula]

therefore

[formula]

Thus, selecting a being either a square or not, we obtain that the set [formula] contains quadratic residues and non-quadratic residues.

It follows from the corollary above and Lemma [\ref=wlog] that, in the case m  =  (q - 1) / 2, it is possible to get more than the m distinct values which were provided by Lemma [\ref=pinA].

Let [formula] be a prime number such that q  ≥  13, [formula], such that [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that each of the sets

[formula]

has at least two distinct elements modulo q. Then the set

[formula]

has at least q - 1 distinct elements.

Proof: By Lemma [\ref=wlog], we can suppose without loss of generality that

[formula]

Notice that we can obtain αsj by shifting the coefficients, so αsj∈A for all 0  ≤  j  ≤  m - 1. By Lemma [\ref=pinA], these m elements are distinct.

Since [formula], s is a square modulo q and, indeed, s generates the quadratic residues modulo q, therefore the elements αsj are all quadratic residues or all non-quadratic residues depending on whether α is a square or not. Define

[formula]

In the same way, by Lemma [\ref=wlog] we can assume without loss of generality that [formula]. Since c  +  bs2j∈A for all 0  ≤  j  ≤  m / 2, Corollary [\ref=squarenonsquare] tells us that the set {c  +  bs2j|  0  ≤  j  ≤  m / 2} contains a quadratic residue and a non-quadratic residue modulo q. By multiplying by s, we obtain all quadratic residues and all non-quadratic residues modulo q. Therefore, |A|  ≥  q - 1.

Analogously to the previous corollary but now in the case m  =  q - 1, the next result states that it is possible to split the coefficients into parts such that each part generates at least m distinct values, also improving the result of Lemma [\ref=pinA].

Let [formula] be a prime number such that q  ≥  13, s be a generator of [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that each of the sets

[formula]

has at least two distinct elements modulo q. Then each of the sets

[formula]

have at least q - 1 distinct elements.

Proof: This follows directly from the previous corollary.

Sequences in [formula]

In our proof of Theorem [\ref=main], for the case [formula], we use Corollaries [\ref=q=1] [\ref=r=2] and [\ref=q=1] [\ref=r=1], where the hypothesis q  ≥  13 is necessary. In this section, we consider the remaining case, i.e., q  =  5. There are two possibilities for m, namely, m = 2 and m = 4.

For m = 2 the only possible value for s is 4 mod 5, therefore we obtain the Dihedral Group of order 10. The next proposition deals with this case and shows that if a sequence S is free of product-1 subsequences and satisfies some assumptions then S must contain an element in H, the normal subgroup.

Let S be a sequence in [formula] free of product-1 subsequences and suppose that |S|  =  5. Then [formula].

Proof: Suppose that [formula], where [formula]. If there exist two identical elements in S then their product is 1 and so S is not free of product-1 subsequences. Thus, [formula], therefore x  ·  xy4  ·  xy  ·  xy2  =  1. Hence, S is not free of product-1 subsequences, a contradiction.

For m = 4, the cases to consider are [formula] or [formula]. The proposition below shows that if S is free of product-1 subsequences then S can not belong to a single coset Ni, where gcd (i,4)  =  1.

Let s∈{2,3} and let S be a sequence in [formula] such that |S|  =  7. If every element of S belongs to a coset Ni, where i∈{1,3}, then S is not free of product-1 subsequences.

Proof: Let [formula], where i∈{1,3} and [formula]. Notice that at most three of the αj's are equal, otherwise the product of four identical elements would be 1. This implies that there are at least three distinct elements. Also, there are at least a pair of elements repeating two or three times. Since [formula], it follows that [formula]. Therefore, for all [formula] it holds that:

[formula]

thus we may assume without loss of generality that the element that repeats most is α1  =  0. If there is another pair of identical elements, say 1  ≤  αj  =  αj + 1  =  λ  ≤  4 for some 3  ≤  j  ≤  6, then we may choose A1  =  (x,xyλ,x,xyλ) or A1  =  (x3,x3yλ,x3,x3yλ). Since [formula] and gcd (i,4)  =  1, it follows that [formula], and so xi  ·  xiyλ  ·  xi  ·  xiyλ  =  1. Otherwise, the only possibility is [formula] and we may choose, for example,

[formula]

as the following table shows:

Thus, S is not free of product-1 subsequences.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

In this section we investigate the sequences of [formula] with m + q - 2 elements which are free of product-1 subsequences and we prove that an analogue of Property C holds for [formula] provided [formula] and (m,q)  ≠  (2,3). Notice that if (m,q)  =  (2,3) then [formula] and the assertion of Theorem [\ref=main] is not true for the group [formula], which is isomorphic to D6, the Dihedral Group of order 6, and to S3, the Permutation Group of 3 elements. In fact, the sequence S  =  (x,xy,xy2) provides the only counter example when (m,q)  =  (2,3).

It is easy to check that (ii) implies (i), therefore we just need to prove that (i) implies (ii). Let us assume that S is a sequence free of product-1 subsequences in [formula]. Let us also define [formula] by the equation

[formula]

If k  ≤  0, since D(H)  =  D(Cq)  =  q, then there exists a product-1 subsequence in H.

If k  =  1 then [formula] and [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=propC], the elements of [formula] must all be equal, say, [formula] and the other elements of S must be in the same Ni, where gcd (i,m) = 1.

From now on, assume k  ≥  2. In this case, we are going to prove that S is not free of product-1 subsequences. We have

[formula]

Let [formula] be a subsequence of [formula] such that π(A)∈H≃Cq but no subsequence of A has product in H, as in Lemma [\ref=pinA]. We have that 2  ≤  |A|  ≤  m. Let us denote A by A1. If [formula] then we can construct A2 with the same property and repeat this argument replacing successively [formula] by [formula] and so on, until [formula]. This implies that

[formula]

We construct the following set of products:

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Davenport inequality we obtain

[formula]

If this minimum is q then R  =  H∋1 and S is not free of product-1 subsequences. On the other hand, if this minimum is [formula] then we obtain at least k - 1 distinct elements in H arising from [formula]. Suppose without loss of generality that [formula]. If [formula] then, by the Pigeonhole Principle, either 1∈R or R contains the inverse of one of the products [formula], hence S is not free of product-1 subsequences.

Therefore, suppose that [formula], namely, [formula]. If there exist 1  ≤  n1  ≤  k - 1 and 1  ≤  n2  ≤  q - k such that [formula] then [formula] and so S is not free of product-1 subsequences. Therefore,

[formula]

If hi  ≠  hj for some 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  q - k, say without loss of generality that h1  ≠  h2, then either the set

[formula]

has q elements, in particular, it has the element 1, or it contains two identical elements. In any case, S has a product-1 subsequence. Hence,

[formula]

for some 1  ≤  t  ≤  q - 1 and

[formula]

Let [formula]. Notice that C is free of subsequences with product in H. Since

[formula]

we conclude, by Theorem [\ref=propC], that C does not have subsequences with product in H if these m - 1 elements are in the same class Ni0,1  ≤  i0  ≤  m - 1, gcd (i0,m) = 1. Thus, we assume that C is a sequence in [formula], namely,

[formula]

If there exist 1  ≤  j  ≤  r such that Aj has at least one element out of Ni0, then we may select xi1yθ∈Aj with i1  ≠  i0. If 2  ≤  l  ≤  m - 1 is such that [formula] then we may replace Aj by

[formula]

which also has product in H, since

[formula]

for some [formula] and [formula]. Since ||  >  |Aj|, the new set R generated by this change has more elements. This replacement may mean that [formula] is not minimal anymore and in this case we break [formula] into its minimal components. Thus,

[formula]

therefore there exists a product-1 subsequence in S.

Hence, [formula] must be a sequence in Ni0, so

[formula]

By double counting the number of elements in [formula] we conclude that [formula], that is, [formula]. Since k  ≥  2 and [formula], we have m  +  1  ≤  k  ≤  q. Observe that the case m + 1  ≤  k  <  q is not possible. In fact, in this case, if

[formula]

then

[formula]

and, more generally,

[formula]

We claim that R is invariant under taking powers of si0. In fact, since gcd (i0,m)  =  1 we obtain [formula]. An element in R is of the form

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  k - 1. Taking powers of si0 in both sides, we obtain that

[formula]

belongs to R, because it can be obtained by the product of some Ai's in some order. Therefore, the claim is proved.

Looking at the exponent of y, the above claim implies that the set [formula] is si0-invariant modulo q, and so [formula] is si0-invariant, which contradicts Lemma [\ref=sinvariant].

From now on, we assume k  =  q and S is a sequence in Ni0. As |Aj|  =  m for 1  ≤  j  ≤  r and |C|  =  m - 1 we obtain mr  +  m  -  1  =  |S|  =  m  +  q  -  2, therefore mr  =  q - 1. We consider the following cases depending on whether r  ≥  3, r  =  2 or r  =  1:

Case r  ≥  3: This implies that 3m  ≤  q - 1. Since the equality in the Cauchy-Davenport inequality occurs, Vosper's Theorem with the sets

[formula]

says that at least one of the following statements hold:

|Ã|  +  ||  >  q;

min {|Ã|,||}  =  1;

|Ã  ·  |  =  q  -  1 and [formula];

Ã and [formula] are arithmetic progressions with the same common difference.

Since |Ã|  +  ||  =  q, (i) is not possible, and since min {|Ã|,||}  ≥  m  ≥  2, (ii) does not hold. In order to discard item (iii), define

[formula]

As 3m  ≤  mr  =  q - 1, we have

[formula]

Therefore, the items (i), (ii) and (ii) from Vosper's Theorem are false, hence the exponents of the elements in each of the sets [formula] and [formula] form arithmetic progressions, say

[formula]

Looking at the Vosper's equality involving Ã and [formula], item (iii) tells us that Ã also form an arithmetic progression in the exponent with the same common difference, say

[formula]

By switching A1 and A2, the only possibility is that [formula] for some 1  ≤  v  ≤  q - 1.

On the other hand, the exponents of the elements from the set {πn(A1)}n are si0-invariant, that is, the exponents of y in R are invariant by multiplication by si0. By Lemma [\ref=sinvariant], the set {πn(A1)}n can not be of the above form.

Case r  =  2: In this case, m  =  (q - 1) / 2 and, in particular, si0 generates the quadratic residues modulo q. The case (m,q)  =  (2,5) follows from Proposition [\ref=mq25], therefore we may assume q  ≥  7. If there exist m identical elements then their product is 1, thus there are at most m - 1 identical elements. Since

[formula]

there are at least 4 distinct elements among [formula]. We split this case into the two subcases [formula] and [formula].

Subcase [formula] and q  ≥  13: We may choose

[formula]

to be disjoint subsequences of S such that it is possible to split each one into two subsequences of the same size, say

[formula]

where each partition has at least 2 distinct elements. This is possible since S has at most m - 1 identical elements. From Corollary [\ref=q=1] [\ref=r=2], A1 and A2 each generate at least q - 1 elements in H, therefore the product-set A1  ·  A2 has to be H by the Cauchy-Davenport inequality, which implies that 1∈A1  ·  A2. Thus S is not free of product-1 subsequences.

Subcase [formula] and q  ≥  7: It is known that - 1 is not a quadratic residue modulo q. Let

[formula]

where A1 and A2 are disjoint subsequences of S and each one has at least 2 distinct elements. It is enough to consider the exponents of y and construct the following sets of exponents:

[formula]

Suppose that [formula], [formula] and [formula] (otherwise we are done). By Lemma [\ref=pinA], |X|  =  |Y|  =  m. Let

[formula]

If -  α∈Y then 0∈X + Y, a contradiction, therefore -  α∈X. Hence, there exist 0  ≤  n  ≤  m - 1 such that [formula], which implies [formula], so - 1 is a quadratic residue modulo q, which is also a contradiction.

Case r  =  1: In this case, m  =  q - 1 and, in particular, m is even and si0 generates [formula]. The cases where (m,q)  =  (4,5) follow from Proposition [\ref=mq45], therefore we may assume q  ≥  7. If there exist m identical elements then their product is 1, thus there are at most m - 1 identical elements. Since

[formula]

there are at least 3 distinct elements among [formula]. Again, we split up this case into [formula] and [formula], as follows:

Subcase [formula] and q  ≥  13: We may choose

[formula]

to be a subsequence of S that we can further split into two subsequences of the same size (q - 1) / 2, say

[formula]

satisfying [formula] and [formula]. Since si0 generates [formula], s2i0 generates the quadratic residues of [formula]. From Corollary [\ref=q=1] [\ref=r=1], there exist two permutations σ of [formula] and τ of [formula] such that

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

thus S is not free of product-1 subsequences.

Subcase [formula] and q  ≥  7: It is known that - 1 is not a quadratic residue modulo q. Let

[formula]

where at least 3 of the aj's are distinct. By considering the set of all products obtained by changing the order of the elements of A1, we obtain the set

[formula]

Hence, it is enough to consider the exponents απ of y. Reindexing the aj's, we may construct the set of exponents

[formula]

where X and Y each have at least 2 distinct elements. Clearly, X + Y  ⊂  C. Suppose that [formula] (otherwise we are done). By Lemma [\ref=pinA], |X + Y|  =  m, thus [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=wlog], we may assume without loss of generality that |X|  =  m / 2 and |Y|  =  m / 2. Let

[formula]

If -  α∈Y then 0∈X + Y, a contradiction. Therefore -  α∈X. Hence, there exists 0  ≤  n  ≤  m - 1 such that [formula], which implies [formula], so - 1 is a quadratic residue modulo q, but this is impossible.
