Introduction

In a very enjoyable article [\cite=Morrison] which follows in the footsteps of Mark Kac's classic [\cite=Kac], Kent Morrison obtained a countable family of infinite trigonometric product representations of the sinc function (formulas (12), (13) in [\cite=Morrison]; more on these in section [\ref=PROB]); special cases are explicitly displayed in formulas (1), (9), (14), (15) of [\cite=Morrison]. Curiously, Morrison's formula (9), viz.

[formula]

shows a close semblance to an infinite product considered some years ago by the reknowned amateur mathematician Benoit Cloitre, which reads

[formula]

Superficially, the differences in the products seem not too dramatic: the exponentially decreasing frequencies 2  ·  3- n in Morrison's product ([\ref=MorrisonPROD]) are replaced by the inverse power law n- 2 in Cloitre's product ([\ref=CloitrePROD]), and the coefficients [formula] and [formula] have switched places. However,  (x) is not at all as simple as sin x / x.

First of all, due to the switch [formula] of the coefficients, Cloitre's infinite product is positive for all x, and due to the slower decay with n of the frequencies, it decays much faster in x space, though not exponentially fast. Cloitre surmised that asymptotically [formula] when x  →    ∞   for some positive constant C.

In this paper we consider a more general family of Cloitre-type products in which [formula] is replaced by p∈(0,1] and [formula] by 1 - p, and furthermore n- 2 is replaced by n- q for [formula]. We prove a theorem (see section [\ref=THM] for its precise statement and its elementary(!) proof) which, when [formula] and q = 2, yields the stronger result that

[formula]

with correction term bounded as |ε(|x|)|  ≤  K|x|1 / 3 for some K > 0, and with

[formula]

numerically, [formula]. Cloitre's surmise follows as corollary.

Empirically, the [formula] error bound is found to be sharp for moderately large |x| but it eventually becomes far off. Interestingly, the difference ε(|x|) between Cloitre's [formula] and its regular trend [formula], although deterministic, seems to be an "empirically unpredictable" function; see Fig. 1 & 2.

A probabilistic inquiry into this phenomenon in section [\ref=PROB] will unveil  (x) as the characteristic function of a random Riemann-ζ function evaluated at 2. Empirical and theoretical data of some related random Riemann-ζ functions are presented, too.

We conclude our paper with a paradoxical random-walk scenario and a remark on the Riemann hypothesis.

Cloitre-type Products and their Trends

We now consider a generalization of Cloitre's product of the form

[formula]

Formula ([\ref=CloitrePRODgeneralized]) reduces to Cloitre's ([\ref=CloitrePROD]) when p = 1 / 3 and q = 2. The common features amongst the [formula] are:

(a) all are convergent infinite products of sums of cosines;

(b) the frequencies obey a reciprocal power law, i.e. n- q;

(c) the coefficients (1 - p and p) are positive and add up to unity; (d) for [formula] the constant term dominates each oscillating term, i.e. 1 - 2p > 0.

We will next state our theorem about the trend function of the Cloitre-type products and then present its elementary proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=THMgenCLOITREtrend]:

Since [formula], we can take its logarithm and obtain the infinite series

[formula]

We now closely follow the proof of Theorem 1 of [\cite=KieJSPforBenJerryMichael] which establishes that when q > 1, then for all [formula] one has [formula], with [formula] and [formula] for some [formula].

By the reflection symmetry w.r.t. x = 0 of [formula] it suffices to consider x > 0; however, we need to distinguish [formula] and [formula] for some [formula].

First of all, if [formula] is sufficiently small, then for [formula] we have the Maclaurin expansion [formula], and so it follows that [formula] for some K > 0 when [formula]. Here and in all estimates below, K is a generic positive constant which may depend on [formula].

Turning to x  ≥  xq, we choose τ  <  π / 2 and split the summation in the series ([\ref=logCloitrePRODgeneralized]) for [formula] at n  =  ⌈(qx  /  τ)1  /  (q  +  1)⌉ = :Nq(x / τ), viz.

[formula]

where [formula]. We will prove that the second sum in ([\ref=eq:SdefSsplitSplusONEroot]) yields the trend function plus a subdominant error bound, while the first sum in ([\ref=eq:SdefSsplitSplusONEroot]) yields only a subdominant error bound. We pave the ground outlining the argument.

Since τ  <  π / 2, when x gets large any two consecutive arguments x / nq and x / (n + 1)q of the cosine functions will come to lie within one quarter period of cosine whenever n  >  ⌈(qx  /  τ)1  /  (q  +  1)⌉. Moreover, with increasing n, for fixed x / τ, the consecutive arguments x / nq and x / (n + 1)q will be more and more closely spaced. And so, when τ is sufficiently small, with increasing x the part of the sum of [formula] with n  >  Nq(x / τ) becomes an increasingly better Riemann sum approximation to

[formula]

Thus, and using the variable substitution ν- qx = ξ, we have (informally)

[formula]

Since q > 1 / 2, the upper limit of integration at r.h.s.([\ref=eq:SdefSsplitSplusONErootINTapprox]) goes to ∞   like Kx1 / (q + 1) when x  →    ∞  . The limiting integral converges and, after integration by parts, reads

[formula]

This heuristic argument will now be made rigorous by supplying the subdominant error bounds, using only senior level undergraduate mathematics.

Thus, for the first sum at r.h.s.([\ref=eq:SdefSsplitSplusONEroot]), we use the triangle inequality, then the estimate [formula], sum over n, then use an obvious estimate, and obtain

[formula]

For the second sum at r.h.s.([\ref=eq:SdefSsplitSplusONEroot]) we find, for some νn∈[n,n  +  1],

[formula]

here, ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTa]) is obviously true, whereas ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTb]) expresses the mean value theorem for some νn∈[n,n  +  1], and ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTc]) holds by the fundamental theorem of calculus; inequality ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTd]) holds by the triangle inequality, ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTe]) holds since | sin ξ|  ≤  1, followed by elementary integration, while ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTf]) is due to the monotonic decrease of ν  ↦  ν- q for q > 1 / 2, with νn∈[n,n  +  1]; equality ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTg]) holds because the sum at l.h.s.([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTg]) is telescoping; lastly, inequality ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTh]) is obvious.

For the integral in ([\ref=eq:secondSsumESTa]) the variable substitution ν- qx = ξ yields

[formula]

Using again the estimate [formula], we find (for x  ≥  1):

[formula]

This completes the proof of ([\ref=genCLOITREasymp]). It remains to prove ([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffC]), ([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffA]), ([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffB]).

With the help of the geometric series we rewrite the integral in ([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffC]) as

[formula]

Repeatedly using the trigonometric identity 2 sin (α) cos (β)  =   sin (α  +  β) -  sin (α  -  β), eventually followed by a simple rescaling of the integration variable, now yields

[formula]

where it is understood that when k = 0 one has [formula]. The integral at r.h.s.([\ref=trigINTexpand]) is [formula] given in ([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffA]). Inserting ([\ref=trigINTexpand]) into ([\ref=Cpq]) and pulling out [formula] yields r.h.s.([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffC]) with

[formula]

and a simple manipulation of r.h.s.([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffBagain]) now yields ([\ref=genCLOITREcoeffB]).

This completes the entirely elementary proof of Theorem [\ref=THMgenCLOITREtrend]. QED

Probabilistic Revelations

Morrison's paper [\cite=Morrison], beginning "The function sin x / x is endlessly fascinating," derives infinitely many representations of sin x / x from the fact that this is the expected value of eixΩ when Ω is the uniform random variable on the interval

[formula]

into q > 1 subintervals of length 2 / q, at the [formula] step one divides each of these q subintervals into q further subintervals of length 2 / q2, and so on -- at the N-th step

[formula]

. Thus, for each [formula], q > 1,

[formula]

Next, repeatedly using the identity eaeb = ea + b, one readily verifies that, for [formula],

[formula]

If, and only if, q is odd, then one of the exponents at r.h.s.([\ref=uniformSAMPLINGidentity]) vanishes, at m = (q + 1) / 2; all other exponents occur once positive and once negative, the sum of the pertinent pair is twice a cosine, say 2 cos a -- but, 2 cos a  =   cos a  +   cos ( - a), and so

[formula]

The identities ([\ref=uniformSAMPLINGidentity]) and ([\ref=uniformSAMPLINGidentityB]) turn ([\ref=sincBYuniformSAMPLING]) into Morrison's sinc representations

[formula]

q even in ([\ref=MorrisonPRODgeneral]) is formula (12) in [\cite=Morrison], q odd in ([\ref=MorrisonPRODgeneral]) is formula (13) in [\cite=Morrison]. In particular, q = 3 yields ([\ref=MorrisonPROD]), while q = 2 gives formula (1) of [\cite=Morrison], an infinite

product due to Euler which deserves being displayed again here:

[formula]

yet, note that formula ([\ref=MorrisonPRODgeneral]) is not valid for q = 1: namely, when q = 1 only m = 0 occurs, so the left-hand side becomes an infinite product of 1s, not sinc(x).

After a moment of reflection one realizes that there is nothing privileged about the characteristic function of a uniform random variable on

[formula]

by removing middle thirds ad infinitum.

In this vein, suppose that for each [formula] there exist frequencies [formula] with [formula] finite; and suppose there exist [formula] non-negative numbers p(n)m satisfying p(n)m  ≥  0 and [formula] such that the infinite product of the form

[formula]

converges; then [formula] is the characteristic function of some random variable Ω. The N-th partial product is the characteristic function of the N-th finite approximation to Ω: a sample mean over N trials with independent random variables Ωn which are generally not identical. In particular, Cloitre's infinite trigonometric product and its generalizations ([\ref=CloitrePRODgeneralized]) are characteristic functions of some random variables.

Given the ps and ωs, can one characterize the law for Ω beyond stating that it is the Fourier transform of its characteristic function ([\ref=MorrisonPRODgeneralized])? For Cloitre's infinite trigonometric product and its generalization ([\ref=CloitrePRODgeneralized]) with p∈[0,1] and q > 1 / 2 the answer is: "Yes!" This is accomplished by adapting the procedure already described in [\cite=Kac] and in [\cite=Morrison] for Euler's formula ([\ref=EULERprod]), and in [\cite=Morrison] for ([\ref=MorrisonCANTORprod]) and for

[formula]

Consider the following random walk on the real frequency (ω) axis: You repeatedly toss both a fair coin and a possibly loaded one (with Prob(H) = p, say) independently of each other and of the previous tosses. Each toss of the loaded coin decides whether you move from your current position or stay put; let's stipulate that you do move when head (H) shows, i.e. with probability p. Each concurrent and independent toss of the fair coin decides whether you move left or right (if you do move). Moreover, if the n-th toss of both coins comes out on "move," you move by 1 / nq units in the direction determined by the fair coin. Starting at ω = 0, you keep carrying out these random moves ad infinitum -- we call this a "random Riemann-ζ walk" because its outcome is a "random Riemann-ζ function" evaluated at q -- with probability 1 it converges to a random position Ωζp;q on the ω line (the walk itself equals the sequence of the partial sums). Note that Riemann's ζ-function [formula], its reciprocal [formula] (where μ(n)∈{ - 1,0,1} is the Möbius function; see [\cite=Edwards]), and [formula] (where λ(n)∈{ - 1,1} is Liouville's λ-function; see [\cite=OEIS]), all are possible outcomes of a random Riemann-ζ walk with q > 1. In the limiting cases p = 0 and p = 1 you either stay put forever (p = 0) or you are always on the move (p = 1). Incidentally, if instead of decreasing the step size according to the power law n- q one uses an exponentially decreasing step size q- n with q > 1, the outcome is a "random power series;" we call these "power walks," and use [formula] to denote their limiting random position.

We register the following special cases:

(i) Ωζ1 / 3;2 is the random variable for Cloitre's infinite trigonometric product ([\ref=CloitrePROD]). In

this case the random walk can be executed by repeatedly rolling a fair die -- if

the n-th roll shows 1 you move [formula] units to the right, if it shows 6 you move [formula]

units to the left, and you stay put otherwise (which is the case 2 / 3 of the time).

(ii) Ωζ1;1 is the random variable for Morrison's trigonometric product ([\ref=MorrisonPRODharmonic]), generated

by a "harmonic random walk," or "random harmonic series" [\cite=Morrison] [\cite=Schmuland].

Since the harmonic series diverges logarithmically, the outcome of the harmonic

random walk is presumably distributed over the whole real line; cf. [\cite=Schmuland].

(iii) [formula] is the random variable for which Euler's ([\ref=EULERprod]) is the characteristic function;

(iv) [formula] is the random variable for which Morrison's infinite trigonometric product

([\ref=MorrisonCANTORprod]) is the characteristic function, modulo a rescaling of x by a factor of 2;

(v) [formula] is the random variable for which Morrison's infinite trigonometric product

(9) (our formula [\ref=MorrisonPROD]) is the characteristic function, modulo rescaling x  ↦  2x.

For all the p;q combinations in [\cite=Kac] and [\cite=Morrison] the probability law of [formula] is a uniform measure on an explicitly characterized set. Whether there are p;q combinations for which a closed form expression for the probability law of Ωζp;q in terms of known functions exists is an interesting open question. Similarly, we know their characteristic functions only in terms of the generalized Cloitre-type products, but we don't know whether any of these can be expressed in closed form as a finite combination of some known functions. However, our Theorem [\ref=THMgenCLOITREtrend] does imply something interesting about Ωζp;q when [formula]. Namely, Fourier transform theory yields: Further insights are available. While the random variable [formula] is always bounded, the random variable Ωζp;q is bounded if and only if q > 1, in which case it takes values in the interval

[formula]

. Since the characteristic function for [formula] is simply a rescaled generalized Cloitre-type product, it shares all its qualitative features with the original -- in particular, when [formula] it is positive and therefore cannot be equal to sinc(x), and so [formula], hence Ωζp;q, [formula], is never distributed uniformly over its interval

[formula]

.

But how nonuniform is the distribution? In the next Figure we display the Fourier transforms of Cloitre's infinite trigonometric product and its trend function, plus a histogram of the endpoints of 105 walks with 1000 steps.

Fig. 3 reveals an intriguingly rich structure of the Riemann-ζ walk that gives rise to Cloitre's  (x), hinting at self-similarity. Fig. 3 also reveals that the trend factor [formula], which captures the large scale behavior of  (x), misses all of its important "small" scale details that show up in the Fourier transform of  (x). Finally, it reveals that the limit density is very well approximated by the relative frequencies of the 100-thousand walks sample displayed in the adjacent diagram.

The walks themselves are also of interest in their own right. In the next figure we display (in black) the fractal tree (cf. [\cite=Mandelbrot], chpt.16; note its self-similarity) of all possible walks for [formula] & q = 2, plotted top-down to resemble a Galton board figure. Also shown (in red) is a computer-generated sample of 7 random Riemann-ζ walks with [formula] & q = 2. (The figure is truncated after 9 steps, though; more steps would only produce a black band between the current cutoff and the finish line).

We just pointed out that the random Riemann-ζ walks are bounded iff q > 1. The borderline case q = 1 is particularly interesting. When p  ≠  1 this random walk is a generalization of Morrison's harmonic random walk (p = 1). And when [formula] the "trend factor" of the characteristic function for [formula] becomes [formula]: the charactistic function of a Cauchy random variable with "theoretical spread" [formula] which is explicitly computable. MAPLE gives

[formula]

and, for [formula],

[formula]

so with [formula] we obtain [formula] in closed form, displayed in Fig. 5. The extreme value [formula].

In the next Figure we display the pdf fΩζ1 / 3;1(ω) for the harmonic random walk with [formula], together with the Cauchy distribution of theoretical spread [formula] about 0, and next to it a histogram of the endpoints of 105 walks with 1000 steps.

The discrepancy between the pdf fΩζ1 / 3;1(ω) for the harmonic random walk with [formula] and the Cauchy distribution of theoretical spread [formula] about 0 (obtained by Fourier transform of the pertinent trend factor) visible in Fig. 6 is not quite as flagrant as the corresponding discrepancy in Fig. 3. Note that for q = 1 no diagram obtained with a finite number of trials can ever show the infinite range of the random variable Ωζ1  /  3;1(ω) and its underlying harmonic random walk with [formula].

We refrain from displaying a harmonic random walk tree -- although harmonic walks converge with probability 1, as proved by Rademacher and pointed out by Morrison [\cite=Morrison] (see also [\cite=Kac]), it is difficult to illustrate them faithfully.

Lastly we display a histogram for 105 harmonic walks with 103 steps when p = 1:

It resembles the pdf fΩζ1;1(ω), denoted φ(ω) in Fig. 3 of [\cite=Morrison], more closely than Fig. 4 in [\cite=Morrison] based on 5,000 walks with 100 steps. See also [\cite=Schmuland].

In this paper we have proved Cloitre's surmise, and more. We next plan to inquire into the random Riemann-ζ variables Ωζp;q and their underlying random Riemann-ζ walks more systematically for a more representative selection of p and q values.

Amongst these, the walks with p = 1 / ζ(2) or p = 1 are especially interesting, for these theoretical probabilities agree with the empirical frequencies of "moving" in the walks 1  /  ζ(q) and ζ(2q)  /  ζ(q), respectively. This raises the question whether these may be typical random Riemann-ζ functions when p = 1 / ζ(2), respectivey p = 1, where by a typical walk we mean a walk which exhibits all features of the theoretical random-walk law which occur with probability 1. (In this sense, ζ(q) is most atypical for all p∈(0,1].) However, a moment of reflection reveals that this would be a paradoxical situation: if 1  /  ζ(q) and / or ζ(2q)  /  ζ(q) are typical random Riemann-ζ functions for the mentioned p-values, then one can learn something about them by studying what is typical for random walks with those p-values. Of course, if one learns something about 1  /  ζ(q) and / or ζ(2q)  /  ζ(q), then one also learns something about ζ(q) -- but how can one learn something about the most atypical random Riemann-ζ function by studying what is typical for those random walks?

The obvious way out of this dilemma is to conclude that neither 1  /  ζ(q) nor ζ(2q)  /  ζ(q) can be typical random Riemann-ζ functions. However, as Alex Kontorovich has pointed out to us, a certain typical behavior featured by the 1 / ζ(q) walk at q = 0 when p = 1 / ζ(2), beyond the agreement of empirical and theoretical frequencies, would be equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis. Namely, as explained in [\cite=Edwards], chpt.12.1, Littlewood proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that for every ε > 0 one has [formula]. And as explained in [\cite=Edwards], chpt.12.3, Denjoy noted that if one assumes that the [formula] values of μ(n) are essentially distributed as if they were generated by fair and independent coin flips then the central limit theorem implies that [formula] holds with probability 1.

Paraphrasing Morrison: The Riemann ζ function is endlessly fascinating. Isn't it?
