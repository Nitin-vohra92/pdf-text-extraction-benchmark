First measurement of coherent double neutral-pion photoproduction on the deuteron at incident energies below 0.9 GeV

The internal structure of hadrons is a subject in the non-perturbative domain of the fundamental theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics. The familiar mesons and baryons are composed of q and qqq, respectively. More complex quark configurations beyond these are objects of great interest to investigate the effective degrees of freedom describing hadrons and to understand color confinement. The WASA-at-COSY collaboration has recently reported the isoscalar d*(2380) resonance with mass M≃2380 MeV and width Γ≃68 MeV, which is observed in the pn  →  π0π0d [\cite=cosy1] and pn  →  π+π-d [\cite=cosy2] reactions. The first indication corresponding to this resonance was observed in the former reaction by the CELSIUS/WASA collaboration [\cite=cels]. The resonance may be attributed to an isoscalar ΔΔ quasi-bound state, D03, predicted by Dyson and Xuong [\cite=dx]. In addition to the π0π0d and π+π-d final states, evidence for the d*(2380) resonance has been confirmed by the WASA-at-COSY collaboration in the π0π-pp [\cite=cosy3], π0π0pn [\cite=cosy4], and π+π-pn [\cite=cosy5] final states. The SAID partial wave analysis, which incorporates the analyzing power for the quasi-elastic [formula] scattering measured by the WASA-at-COSY collaboration, also supports the existence of the d*(2380) resonance with quantum numbers I(Jπ) = 0(3+) [\cite=cosy6] [\cite=cosy7]. These experimental results have stimulated intensive theoretical investigations of D03 [\cite=ds1] [\cite=ds2]. To date, all the observations have been made using pn collisions. Nearly all the measurements were made by the WASA-at-COSY collaboration.

The d*(2380) resonance should be observable in photoproduction reactions if it exists. The γd  →  π+π-d and γd  →  π0π0d reactions are expected to be of value when studying the production mechanism of the d*(2380) resonance. It may be produced as an intermediate state in the s channel, and decays into a final state including a deuteron, where no special treatment is required kinematically for the Fermi motion of nucleons. The former reaction was studied by the CLAS collaboration at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Their preliminary result does not show a peak corresponding to the d*(2380) resonance [\cite=jlab]. The π+π-d final state includes the isovector (I  =  1) component, while the π0π0d has just the isoscalar (I  =  0) component alone. The Kroll-Ruderman contact term is expected to give a large effect in the π+π-d channel, i.e., the γNπ± coupling is large. This may hide the d*(2380) contribution in the γd  →  π+π-d yield. Therefore, the γd  →  π0π0d reaction is thought to be the best process to investigate the d*(2380) resonance in photoproduction.

Two series of meson photoproduction experiments [\cite=exp] were carried out using the tagged photon beam [\cite=tag2] [\cite=bpm] at the Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH), Tohoku University. The photon beam was produced by a bremsstrahlung process with a carbon fiber from the 0.93 GeV circulating electrons in a synchrotron called the STretcher Booster (STB) ring [\cite=stb]. The tagging energy of the photon beam ranged from 0.57 to 0.88 GeV. The target used in the experiments was liquid deuterium with a thickness of 45.9 mm. The incident photon energy gives a γd center of mass energy, Wγd, from 2.38 to 2.61 GeV, and the lowest photon energy corresponds to the centroid of the d*(2380) resonance.

All the final-state particles in the γd  →  π0π0d reaction were measured using an electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter complex, FOREST [\cite=forest]. FOREST consists of three different EM calorimeters: the forward, central, and backward calorimeters consisting of 192 pure CsI crystals, 252 lead scintillating fiber modules, and 62 lead glass Cherenkov counters, respectively. A plastic scintillator (PS) hodoscope is placed in front of each calorimeter to identify the charged particles. The solid angle of FOREST is approximately 88% in total. The typical tagging rate was 2.8 MHz, and the photon transmittance (so-called tagging efficiency) was approximately 42% [\cite=tag2]. The trigger condition of the data acquisition (DAQ) is described elsewhere [\cite=forest]. The average trigger rate was 1.1 kHz, and the average DAQ efficiency was 85%.

Events detected in the final state containing four neutral particles and a charged particle were selected. Each neutral pion in the γd  →  π0π0d reaction was identified via its decay into γγ. Photons were detected as a set (cluster) of hit calorimeter modules without any responses of the hit PSs in the front hodoscope. The details of making clusters in FOREST are described in Ref. [\cite=forest]. The time difference between every two neutral clusters of four was required to be less than 3σt, where σt denotes the time resolution for the difference depending on the modules and their measured energies for the two clusters. Deuterons in the final state were detected with the forward hodoscope called SPIDER, and the direction of emission was determined by the hit PSs. Note that the response of the corresponding calorimeter called SCISSORS III was not required. The time delay from the average time response between the four neutral clusters was required to be larger than 1 ns. The energy measured with SPIDER was required to be greater than 2Emip, where Emip denotes the energy that the minimum ionizing particle deposits in a PS. The momentum of deuterons was calculated from the measured time delay assuming that the charged particles had the mass of the deuteron.

A kinematic fit with six constraints (6C) was applied for the further event selection of the γd  →  π0π0d reaction. The kinematic variables in the fit were the incident photon energy, the three momenta of the five final-state particles, and the reaction vertex point. Even though FOREST did not have a vertex counter, the (x,y) intensity map of the photon beam was measured using a beam-profile monitor [\cite=bpm] day by day. The measured variable and its resolution for the x(y)-component of the vertex point was assumed to be the same as the centroid and width of the x(y) distribution of the photon beam at the target position. Because the attenuation of the photon beam flux was negligibly small passing through the liquid deuterium target, the measured variable and its resolution for the z-component was assumed to be the same as the center and thickness(σ) of the target. The required constraints were energy and three-momentum conservation between the initial and final states and two γγ invariant masses (the neutral-pion rest mass, mπ0). Events in which the χ2 probability was higher than 0.1 were selected. Because accidental coincidence events exist between the photon-tagging counter, STB-Tagger II [\cite=tag2], and FOREST, sideband background subtraction was performed.

The 6C kinematic fit is effective at selecting the γd  →  π0π0d reaction. Fig. [\ref=fig1] shows the correlation between the measured energy by a first-layer PS in SPIDER and the fitted momentum of a deuteron. Only the locus corresponding to the deuteron is observed after the kinematic fit. Fig. [\ref=fig2](a) shows the typical π0π0 invariant mass (mππ) distribution. The mππ distribution for the real data is quite different from that for the isotropic generation of the three final-state particles. No enhancement corresponding to the ABC effect [\cite=abc] is observed in the lower-mass region close to 2mπ0. Conversely, a strong enhancement is observed in the higher-mass region. Fig. [\ref=fig2](b) shows the typical π0d invariant mass (mπd) distribution. No significant difference between the real data and the simulation is observed in the mπd distribution.

The total cross section of the γd  →  π0π0d reaction can be obtained from the equation

[formula]

which uses the number of events for the γd  →  π0π0d reaction, Nπ0π0d, the effective number of incident photons, N'γ, the number of target deuterons per unit area, Nτ = 0.237 b[formula], the acceptance of the final state π0π0d  →  γγγγd detection, ηacc, and the branching ratio of the neutral pion to the two-photon decay, BR(π0   →   γγ). The number of incident photons, Nγ, is determined by multiplying the number of tagging signals after the counting-loss correction by the corresponding photon transmittance. The N'γ is obtained additionally multiplying Nγ by the DAQ efficiency. The acceptance of γγγγd detection is estimated by a Monte-Carlo simulation based on Geant4 [\cite=geant4]. Here, the total cross section as a function of the incident energy is assumed to be flat. To reproduce the measured mππ distribution, the mππ distribution for generated events is assumed to have an additional dependence from isotropic generation:

[formula]

with n = 1.7, where m maxππ and m minππ denote the maximum and minimum values for mππ, respectively, at the fixed incident photon energy.

Because the statistic was limited, the tagging channels were divided into 16 groups, and the total cross section was obtained for each group. Fig. [\ref=fig3] shows the total cross section σ for the γd  →  π0π0d reaction as a function of Wγd. The total cross section is rather flat, and a clear resonance-like behavior is not observed in the excitation function for Wγd = 2.38-2.61 GeV,

To estimate the systematic uncertainty of event yields, we varied the lower limit of event selection in the kinematic fit, and the uncertainty (σ) was found to range from 5.0% to 9.0% depending on the tagging-energy group. We also tried a kinematic fit excluding the vertex point from the running variables and fixing it to (0,0,0). The difference (σ) between the two kinematic-fit results is 0.5%-5.7%. To estimate the systematic uncertainty of the acceptance, we changed the mππ distribution for event generation in the simulation. The n parameters corresponding to the realistic mππ distributions give the uncertainty (σ) from 0.1% to 0.5%. The uncertainty in the acceptance from the uncertainty in the FOREST coverage is 1.6%-4.7%. The uncertainty in the deuteron detection efficiency is 0.3%-3.9% owing to the uncertainty in the density of the vacuum chamber surrounding the liquid deuterium target. The normalization uncertainties resulting from the number of target deuterons and the number of incident photons are 1% and 1.5%-1.9%, respectively. The total systematic uncertainty is obtained by combining all the uncertainties described above in quadrature. The total systematic uncertainty as a function of Wγd is also plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig2].

As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig2], a significant peak is not observed at W = 2.37 GeV. The d*(2380) contribution was estimated by fitting the function

[formula]

to the data, where BW(Wγd) denotes the relativistic Breit-Wigner function [\cite=bw] corresponding to the expected d*(2380) contribution with a centroid of M = 2.37 GeV and a width of Γ = 68 MeV. The χ2 of the fit is 17.0, and the obtained parameters are

[formula]

Assuming a higher polynomial function for the background contribution instead of a constant σ0, a smaller d*(2380) contribution is obtained. The upper limit of the total cross section was found to be 0.071 μb at Wγd = 2.37 GeV (90% confidence level).

Egorov and Fix recently reported their calculation of the total cross section for the γd  →  π0π0d reaction [\cite=fix2]. For coherent production, the isovector parts in the amplitudes for the π0π0 production on the proton and neutron are canceled. Because the fraction of the isoscalar part is thought to be only 8% of the proton amplitude, the cross section for the coherent production is much smaller than that for the quasi-free π0π0 production on the nucleon (~  10 μb at Eγ=0.60 GeV). Fig. [\ref=fig4] shows the total cross section as a function of the incident energy, Eγ. Even though the measured cross section is of the same order as that of the calculation, a significant difference is observed at the lowest incident photon energy (0.57 GeV). This may be explained by the larger fraction of the isoscalar part in the excitation of the lower-mass baryons. The NΔ system is forbidden in the intermediate state of the γd  →  π0π0d reaction. Suppose a baryon resonance is produced on a nucleon in the deuteron, the lowest-mass resonance that can decay into π0π0N is P11(1440). The center of mass corresponds to an incident photon energy of Eγ = 0.64 GeV; therefore, it is difficult to explain the difference in the cross sections by just the incorrect fraction of the isoscalar part of the P11 excitation. Another possible explanation for this difference is the larger contribution of the sequential π0 emission γN  →  π0Δ  →  π0π0N together with deuteron re-combination. The enhancement in the higher-mass region of the mππ distribution might support this hypothesis. The direct coherent production of the σ meson, which decays into π0π0, may also provide an explanation for the difference.

The total cross sections for the γd  →  π0π0d reaction were measured for the first time using the FOREST detector at ELPH. The incident energy ranged from 0.57 to 0.88 GeV. No clear resonance-like behavior corresponding to the d*(2380) resonance with I(Jπ) = 0(3+) was observed in the excitation function for Wγd = 2.38-2.61 GeV. The upper limit of the total cross section in this reaction was found to be 0.071 μb for the dibaryon resonance at Wγd = 2.37 GeV (90% confidence level). The measured excitation function is rather flat, which is inconsistent with the existing theoretical calculation for the γd  →  π0π0d reaction. A further understanding of the isoscalar part of π0π0 production is required.
