A note on the large progression-free sets in [formula]

Introduction

In his famous papers [\cite=Rot52],[\cite=Rot53], Roth first considered the problem of finding upper bounds for the size of large subset of {1,2,...,N} with no three-term arithmetic progression, and gave the first nontrivial upper bound. Since then, this problem has received considerable attentions by number theorists. Let r3(N) denote the maximal size of a subset of {1,2,...,N} with no three-term arithmetic progression. Roth indeed proved r3(N) = O(N /  log  log N). This was subsequently improved and enhanced by Heath-Brown [\cite=HB87], Szemerédi [\cite=Sze90], Bourgain [\cite=Bou99], Sanders [\cite=San11], [\cite=San12], and Bloom [\cite=Blo16], the best result so far is r3(N) = O(N( log  log N)4  /   log N), due to Bloom.

For an (additively written) abelian group G, we say that a subset A of G is progression-free if there do not exist pairwise distinct a,b,c∈A with a + b  =  2c, and denote by r3(G) the maximal size of progression-free subsets of G. Roth's problem is essentially equivalent to take [formula]. It is interesting to consider the cases of vector spaces, i.e., [formula]. In [\cite=BB82], Brown and Buhler first proved that [formula], and this was qualified by Meshulam [\cite=Mes95] to [formula]. In their ground-breaking paper [\cite=BK12], Bateman and Katz proved that [formula] with some positive constant ε > 0. The best known upper bound, o(2.756n), is due to Ellenberg and Gijswijt [\cite=EG17]. Especially, they proved that, for any prime p  ≥  3, there exists a positive constant c = c(p) < p such that [formula]. For the upper bound of [formula], Sanders [\cite=San09] proved that [formula] with an absolute constant ε > 0. Quite recently, Croot, Lev, and Pach [\cite=CLP17] developed the polynomial method and drastically improved the above upper bound to [formula] in their breakthrough paper.

In this note, we will consider the upper bound of [formula] for general q and give the following Theorem.

For any positive integer q  ≥  3, let A be a subset of [formula] containing no three-term arithmetic progression. Then there exists a positive constant c = c(q) < q such that |A|  =  o(cn).

Proof of the Theorem

First we give some lemmas.

Let A be a subset of [formula] containing no three-term arithmetic progression. Then |A|  =  o(2.756n).

This is the Corollary 5 of [\cite=EG17].

For any prime p > 3, let A be a subset of [formula] containing no three-term arithmetic progression. Then there exists a positive constant c = c(p) < p such that |A|  =  o(cn).

This is the main result of [\cite=EG17].

Let A be a subset of [formula] containing no three-term arithmetic progression. Then |A|  =  o(3.616n).

This is the Theorem 1 of [\cite=CLP17].

For a set S, write

[formula]

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.1.

We first consider the case q = 2l for l  ≥  2. If l = 2, then the result follows from Lemma 2.3. We now suppose l  ≥  3. Let F be the kernel of the homomorphism of [formula] defined by [formula], and we have [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be the set of those F-cosets containing at least one element of A, we write [formula], and for each coset [formula], let [formula]; thus, [formula] (where the union is disjoint), and

[formula]

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, we choose one element ri∈Ai, and then we have

[formula]

The assumption that A is progression-free implies that the sets Ai + Ai and 2Ai are disjoint for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Then we have [formula] since [formula], it follows that the set Ai - ri can be seen as a progression-free subset of [formula]. By Lemma 2.3 we have

[formula]

It is obviously that k  ≤  (q / 4)n, thus we have

[formula]

Now we consider the case that q is not a power of 2, then there must exists an odd prime p such that p|q.

Let F be the kernel of the homomorphism of [formula] defined by [formula], and we have [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be the set of those F-cosets containing at least one element of A, we write as [formula], and for each coset [formula], let [formula]; thus, [formula] (where the union is disjoint), and

[formula]

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, we choose one element ri∈Ai, and then we have

[formula]

The assumption that A is progression-free implies that the sets Ai + Ai and 2Ai are disjoint for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Then we have [formula] and the set Ai - ri can be seen as a progression-free subset of [formula], hence by Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 we have

[formula]

It is obviously that k  ≤  (q / p)n, thus we have

[formula]

as claimed.

Let A be a subset of [formula] containing no three-term arithmetic progression. Then |A|  =  o(10.848n).

Since 12 = 3  ×  4, similar as the first part of the proof of the Theorem, we consider the homomorphism of [formula] defined by [formula], then by Lemma 2.3 we have

[formula]

If we use the second part of the proof of the Theorem, by Lemma 2.1 we can only get

[formula]
