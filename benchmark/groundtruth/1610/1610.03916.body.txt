Upper bound on three tangle of reduced states of four-qubit pure states

Introduction

Statistical mixtures of quantum states have quantum as well classical correlations. Detecting and quantifying nonclassicality (or quantumness) of multipartite quantum system is of special interest in quantum optics [\cite=horo09] [\cite=dodo03] [\cite=peri94], quantum information [\cite=niel00], and recently even in quantum biology [\cite=lamb13] [\cite=li12]. In particular, detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement is increasingly important in experiments in quantum information science [\cite=guhn07] [\cite=eise07] [\cite=wund09] and it also plays a crucial role in investigations in quantum statistical physics, e.g., in studying phase transitions [\cite=sahl15] [\cite=oste02]. State coefficients of a pure quantum state contain complete information about the correlations amongst the subsystems. Local unitary invariance constraints allow us to construct unitary invariant functions of state coefficients to quantify two-way, three-way, four-way,..., N-way entanglement of an N-qubit state. Global negativity [\cite=zycz98] [\cite=vida02] or equivalently concurrence [\cite=hill97] of a pure state of two qubits quantifies two-way correlations. Three tangle [\cite=coff00] is an entanglement monotone that quantifies three-way entanglement of a three-qubit state. Four-way entanglement of a four-qubit state is quantified by four-tangle [\cite=shar13], which for pure state is a degree eight function of state coefficients. Three tangle and four tangle for pure quantum states are moduli of specific local-unitary invariants that are polynomial functions of state coefficients.

Using an intuitive approach coupled to classical theory of invariants it has been shown in ref. [\cite=shar16] that one can construct local unitary invariants characterizing a pure state of N two-level quantum systems (qubits) in terms of N-1 qubit invariants. A natural question is, can we write entanglement of (N-1)-qubit marginals of an N-qubit pure state in terms of invariants of the N-qubit pure state? In this letter, we focus on four qubit states and their three-qubit marginals. Entanglement measures for reduced states are, generally, based on the convex roof of a quantity defined on pure states. In most of the cases they are not computable as there are no efficient ways to calculate convex roofs. Although a closed formula for the three-tangle [\cite=coff00] of pure states is known, for mixed states no such formula is available. Solutions to finding the convex roof of three-tangle for special families of states are, however, available in [\cite=lohm06] [\cite=elts08] [\cite=elts12] [\cite=elts14]. A method to compute entanglement measures based on convex roof constructions is also given in ref. [\cite=toth15]. Recently, Osterloh [\cite=andr16], obtained three tangles of nine classes of four qubit states [\cite=vers02], by finding a decomposition of three qubit mixed state such that its entanglement lies on minimal characteristic curve. We outline the formalism to construct three-tangle of reduced state from relevant three-qubit polynomial invariants of the four qubit pure state. Local unitary invariance of entanglement is the basic principle underlying the construction. In the most general case, it involves finding the roots of a quartic equation. The roots may be found analytically or numerically. Closed formulae for upper bound on three tangles of nine classes of four qubit states [\cite=vers02], are obtained and the results compared with those of ref. [\cite=regu14] [\cite=regu16]. Our results offer tighter constraints on three-way entanglement of a given qubit with the rest of the system than those used in ref. [\cite=regu14] [\cite=regu16].

We start by defining three tangle on pure and mixed states in section II, outline the formalism in section III, and discuss the upper bounds on three tangles for nine classes of four-qubit states in section IV. Section VI contains the concluding remarks.

Definition of Three Tangle

Consider a three qubit pure state

[formula]

where state coefficients ai1i2i3 are complex numbers and im refers to computational basis state of qubit Am, [formula]. Let qubit A1 be the focus qubit. Using the notation from ref. [\cite=shar16], we define [formula] (i3 = 0,1) as determinant of a two-way negativity font and D00i3 = a00i3a11i3 + 1 - a10i3a01i3 + 1, (i3 = 0,1) is a determinant of a three-way negativity font. Three tangle of pure state [formula] as defined in ref. [\cite=coff00] is equal to the modulus of a polynomial invariant of degree four that is [formula], where

[formula]

The entanglement measure [formula] is extended to a mixed state of three qubits via convex roof extension that is

[formula]

where minimization is taken over all possible decompositions [formula] of ρ3.

Upper bound on three tangle of a rank two reduced state

Purification of a rank two three qubit mixed state is a four-qubit pure state. In this section, we describe the construction of upper bound on three tangle of marginal state of a four qubit pure state in terms of three-qubit and four-qubit unitary invariants of the pure state. In the most general case, it involves finding the roots of a quartic equation.The roots may be found analytically or numerically. Analytical form of relevant three-qubit and four-qubit invariants is to be found in Sec. V of ref. [\cite=shar16]. Upper bounds on three qubit mixed state entanglement, used in ref. [\cite=regu14] [\cite=regu16]  in the context of a monogamy of quantum entanglement, had been calculated by using an algorithm [\cite=rodr14] to construct the entanglement-minimizing decomposition for ρ. Our results offer tighter constraints on three-way entanglement of a given qubit with the rest of the system than those used in ref. [\cite=regu14] [\cite=regu16].

Consider a general four qubit pure state, written as

[formula]

where qubits are in the order (A1, A2, A3, A4) corresponding to the state [formula]. Choosing qubit A1 as the focus qubit, we identify [formula] (two-way), [formula] (two-way), [formula] (two-way), [formula] (three-way), [formula] (three-way), [formula] (three-way), and [formula]- (four-way) as the determinants of negativity fonts. We shall also use the three and four qubit invariants constructed in section (V) of ref. [\cite=shar16]. Three-qubit invariants of interest for the triple A1A2A3 in state [formula] comprise a set denoted by [formula]. The form of elements of the set in terms of determinants of negativity fonts is given in Appendix A. The elements in set [formula] are invariant with respect to local unitaries on qubits A1, A2, and A3. Four qubit invariant that quantifies the sum of three-way and four-way correlations [\cite=shar16] of triple A1A2A3, reads as

[formula]

while degree eight invariant that detects genuine four-body entanglement of a four qubit state is given by

[formula]

Invariant I4,8 is a function of three qubit invariants and can be written in alternate forms, being independent of the choice of focus qubit. Four tangle based on degree eight invariant is defined [\cite=shar13] [\cite=shar16] asSet[formula] for the triple A1A2A4 and [formula] for qubits A1A3A4 can be constructed from two-qubit invariants of properly selected pair of qubits (see Appendix A).

Unitary on fourth qubit

To illustrate the method, we focus on three-qubit reduced state [formula], obtained by tracing out qubit A4 from the state [formula]. Probability of finding qubit A4 in state [formula] is denoted by piA4. A unitary [formula], on qubit A4 of state [formula] results in an x dependent state

[formula]

where [formula] is a subnormalized state. Reduced state obtained by tracing out qubit A4 reads as

[formula]

where [formula], is a normalized state, and x dependent probabilities are defined as

[formula]

One can verify that the x dependent three-tangle

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using the definition of three tangle for mixed states (Eq. ([\ref=mix3tangle])), we can write

[formula]

Three qubit invariants [formula] and [formula] are related to elements of the set [formula]} through

[formula]

and

[formula]

To obtain an upper bound on three tangle of mixed state, we find the value of complex parameter x1 such that [formula], and x2 such that [formula]. In the most general case, that involves solving a quartic equation in variable x, (obtained from Eq. ([\ref=i40]) or ([\ref=i04]) ). When the state coefficients are known, the resulting quartic may be solved numerically. However, for the representatives of nine classes of four qubit entanglement analytic solutions are easily found. By definition the three tangle must satisfy Eq. ([\ref=ineq]), as such three tangle satisfies the inequalitygiving us an upper bound on three tangle of the mixed state.

Unitary on three qubit state

If normalized three qubit states [formula] and [formula] are orthogonal to each other then a unitary on three qubit state such that and results in a y dependent four-qubit state

[formula]

such that three tangle may be defined asRecalling that three-qubit invariants, [formula] are degree four functions of state coefficients, in this case

[formula]

and

[formula]

We look for ρ(y1) with [formula], and ρ(y2) such that [formula]. That gives us an upper bound on [formula] since

If for a given state p0A4 = p1A4, then the result obtained by a unitary on fourth qubit coincides with that obtained by a unitary on the three qubit pure states of the decomposition of the mixed state. When p0A4  ≠  p1A4, then minima found by unitary on fourth qubit and those calculated by unitary on three qubit state must be compared to find the correct bound on three tangle for the mixed state.

Three tangle and three-qubit invariants of six groups of states

First of all we notice that since the difference [formula] is a measure of three-way correlations amongst qubits Ai, Aj, and Ak, the three tangle must satisfy the condition [formula]. Evaluation of three-qubit invariants [formula], where Aq refers to the qubit which is traced out, shows that three-qubit marginals of states representing nine classes of four qubits belong in six groups. We use unitary on fourth qubit to express upper bound on three tangle in terms of three-qubit invariants for the following cases of interest:

(i) For a given triple of qubits AiAjAk, [formula], therefore three tangle, [formula].

(ii) Only [formula] is non-zero, therefore, [formula] and [formula].

(iii) Only [formula]  is non-zero, therefore, [formula] and [formula].

(iv) Non zero three-qubit invariants are [formula]and [formula] that is

[formula]

and

[formula]

In this case three tangle satisfies the condition

[formula]

(v) Non zero three-qubit invariants are [formula] and [formula], then to obtain three tangle we use the relationsand

[formula]

leading to the condition

[formula]

(vi) The special case where only [formula] and [formula] are non-zero such that

[formula]

therefore three tangle satisfies the inequality

[formula]

Three tangles for nine classes of four qubit entanglement

In this section, we use the results from previous section to write down upper bounds on three tangles for representatives of nine classes of four qubit states. Our results offer tighter constraints on total three-way entanglement of a given qubit with the rest of the system than those used in refs. [\cite=regu14] [\cite=regu16].

Class I

Class one states are represented by

[formula]

For any partition AiAjAk, [formula], [formula], while [formula]. As a result, 16[formula], therefore three tangle, [formula].

Class II

For class two states three tangle for all four three-qubit partitions has the same value. Consider pure state three-qubit invariants for partition A1A2A3 in representative state

[formula]

Three-qubit invariants have values while [formula]. Consequently the sum of three and four-way correlations is given by Using the result of Eq. ([\ref=tauup4]), we obtain

Class III

Three tangle vanishes on reduced state obtained by tracing out qubit A2 or A4 from state because [formula]. On the other hand, if qubit A3 is traced out then non-zero three-qubit invariants [formula] and [formula], determine the three tangle. Four qubit invariant [formula] and pure state three-way correlation are found to be [formula]. Using the result given in Eq. ([\ref=tauup5]), upper bound on three tangle for the partition A1A2A4 reads as Our upper bound may be compared with the convex roof for the same state reported [\cite=andr16] to be

Class IV

For entanglement class represented by

[formula]

all four reduced density matrices are found to have the same upper bound on three tangle. Taking up the case of qubits A1A2A3, only non-zero pure-state three-qubit invariant is [formula]. Sine I4,8 = 0, three tangle is equal to [formula] . Substituting the value of [formula], we find

Class V

For  representative of entanglement class V, which reads as

[formula]

non-zero three-qubit invariants of interest are and

[formula]

Consequently, [formula], such thatThis bound coincides with the results from ref. [\cite=regu14] and ref. [\cite=andr16].

For the marginal state obtained by tracing out qubit A3, the values of [formula] and [formula] are substituted in Eq. ([\ref=tauup6]) to obtainIn comparison, upper bound on three tangle calculated by Osterloh (Eq. 37 of ref. ([\cite=andr16]) ) corresponds to

Classes VI, VII, VIII and IX

Non-zero pure state three-qubit invariants for class six stateare given by [formula]. Consequently, [formula] is zero on states of the entanglement type represented by state [formula]. States represented by and differ in the amount of two-way correlations. For both the states, [formula], while state nine which reads ashas obviously [formula].

Concluding remarks

For a large number of states, our bound is tighter than that used in ref. [\cite=regu14]. A careful examination shows that the upper bounds on three tangles listed in Table I of ref. [\cite=regu14] are given by [formula]. On the other hand for states that correspond to cases (vi), (v), and (vi) of section III, three tangle satisfiesIn ref. [\cite=andr16] unitary on three qubit states is used to obtain minimal characteristic curves to construct convex roof of three tangle for nine classes of four-qubit states. Comparing the upper bound obtained by unitary on fourth qubit with results for tangle corresponding to minimal characteristic curve in ref. [\cite=andr16] it is noted that for states in class II, class III, and class V our value is lower for certain ranges of state parameters than that of ref. [\cite=andr16]. For all other cases, the result obtained is the same.

To conclude, the method outlined in this letter can be used to obtain three tangle of a rank-two three-qubit mixed state. To write down the equations corresponding to Eq. ([\ref=i40]) and Eq. ([\ref=i04]), one calculates relevant three qubit invariants of the purification of the state. Minimization may need the solution of a quartic equation. If an analytical solution is not available, then the roots of the equation may be found numerically. Correct understanding of relation between pure state correlations and entanglement of marginal states is crucial to discovering the form of monogamy relations for multipartite entanglement.
