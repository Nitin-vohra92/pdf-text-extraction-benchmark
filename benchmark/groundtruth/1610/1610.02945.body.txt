Multilayer diffusion in a composite medium with imperfect contact

Introduction

The problem of heat conduction in a composite wall is a classical problem in design and construction. It is usual to restrict to the case of walls with physical properties that are constant throughout the material and are considered to be of infinite extent in the directions parallel to the wall. Further, we assume that temperature and heat flux do not vary in these directions. In that case, the mathematical model for heat conduction in each wall layer is given by [\cite=HahnO]:

where u(j)(x,t) denotes the temperature in the wall layer indexed by (j), κj > 0 is the heat-conduction coefficient of the j-th layer (the inverse of its thermal diffusivity), x = xj - 1 is the left extent of the layer, x = xj is its right extent, and βn for n = 1,2,3,4 are constants. The sub-indices denote derivatives with respect to the one-dimensional spatial variable x and the temporal variable t. The function u(j)0(x) is the prescribed initial condition of the system. The continuity of the temperature u(j) and of its associated heat flux κju(j)x are imposed across the interface between layers. In what follows it is convenient to use the quantity σj, defined as the positive square root of κj: [formula].

If each layer is in perfect thermal contact then the interface conditions are A derivation of the interface conditions for perfect thermal contact is found in [\cite=HahnO]. However, if the thermal contact is imperfect we prescribe the interface conditions where [formula] is the contact transfer coefficient at x = xj and 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Perfect thermal contact, is recovered in the limit Hj  →    ∞  . In applications, imperfect boundary conditions are used to model roughness and contact resistance [\cite=BarrySweatman] [\cite=CarrTurner] [\cite=CarslawJaeger] [\cite=SridharYovanovich]. Carr and Turner [\cite=CarrTurner] approach this problem using a semi-analytical method based on the Laplace transform and an orthogonal eigenfunction expansion. Their interest in the problem is to accurately solve a two-scale modeling problem for transport or fluid flow in porous media exhibiting small scale heterogeneities in material properties. The authors note that for a large number of layers, multilayer diffusion is possibly the most simple example of such a problem. However, their numerical implementation for their analytical solution only works for up to ten layers [\cite=CarrTurner]. They also propose a "semi-analytical" model which works for a large number of layers.

In this paper, we use the Unified Transform Method (UTM) [\cite=DeconinckTrogdonVasan] [\cite=FokasBook] [\cite=FokasPelloni4] to provide explicit solution formulae for different heat transport interface problems of the types described above. Even for a simple problem (two finite walls in perfect thermal contact), the classical approach using separation of variables [\cite=HahnO] can provide an explicit answer only implicitly. Indeed, the solution obtained in [\cite=HahnO] depends on certain eigenvalues defined through a transcendental equation that can be solved only numerically. In contrast, the UTM produces an explicit solution formula involving only known quantities. In [\cite=DeconinckPelloniSheils] the problem of heat conduction in perfect thermal contact was considered using the UTM to provide explicit solution formulae for a number of examples for up to three domains. In this paper we extend that method to include more general interface conditions and a generic number of interfaces.

Interface problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) are initial boundary value problems for which the solution of an equation in one domain prescribes boundary conditions for the equations in adjacent domains. In applications, interface conditions are often obtained from conservation laws [\cite=Kevorkian]. Few interface problems allow for an explicit closed-form solution using classical solution methods. Using the UTM, such solutions may be constructed for both dissipative and dispersive linear interface problems as shown in [\cite=Asvestas] [\cite=DeconinckPelloniSheils] [\cite=Mantzavinos] [\cite=SheilsDeconinck_PeriodicHeat] [\cite=SheilsDeconinck_LS] [\cite=SheilsDeconinck_LSp] [\cite=SheilsSmith].

The UTM for the heat equation

We follow the standard steps in the UTM. Assuming existence of a solution, we begin with the so-called "local relations":

[formula]

where ωj(k) = (σjk)2. Without loss of generality we shift the problem so that x0 = 0.

Integrating each local relation [\eqref=localrelation] around the appropriate domain (see Figure [\ref=fig:GR_domain_nf]) and applying Green's Theorem we find the global relations:

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1.

We define the following transforms for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1:

[formula]

All of these integrals are proper integrals defined for [formula]. With these definitions the global relations become

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. We transform the global relations so that [formula] and [formula] depend on a common argument ν2 through the change of variables k = ν  /  σj:

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1.

The dispersion relation ωj(k) = (σjk)2 is unchanged under the transformation k  →   - k. Similarly, [formula] and [formula] are unchanged under ν  →    -  ν. Hence, we have a second set of global relations

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. In contrast to equations on an unbounded spatial domain, Equations [\eqref=GR_common_plus] and [\eqref=GR_common_minus] are valid for all [formula].

Evaluating at T = t and inverting the Fourier transform in [\eqref=GR] we have the solution formulae

[formula]

where 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. Using the change of variables k = ν  /  σj and replacing t by T in the arguments of gj and hj by noting that this is equivalent to replacing the integral [formula] with [formula]. Using analyticity properties of the integrand and Jordan's Lemma, the contribution from the second integral is zero and thus,

[formula]

with 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1 and xj - 1 < x < xj. The integrand of the second integral in [\eqref=badsoln] is analytic and decays as |ν|  →    ∞   from within the set bounded between [formula] and ∂D-, and the integrand of the second integral in [\eqref=badsoln] is analytic and decays as |ν|  →    ∞   from within the set bounded between [formula] and ∂D+. Hence, by Jordan's Lemma and Cauchy's Theorem, the contours of integration can be deformed from [formula] to -  ∂D- and ∂D+ respectively.

[formula]

with 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1 and xj - 1 < x < xj where [formula] as in Figure [\ref=fig:heat_Dpm]. This solution is ineffective because it depends on the value of the function and its derivative evaluated at all the interfaces and boundaries. In order to avoid difficulties in formulas which follow, we further deform D  ±   to D±R  =  {ν∈D±:|ν| > R} as in Figure [\ref=fig:heat_DRpm],

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. We replace t by T in the arguments of gj and hj as before

[formula]

While Equation [\eqref=badsoln_dR_t] makes the functional dependence of the solution more complicated than in Equation [\eqref=badsoln_dR_T], it is useful for doing long time asymptotics, i.e. taking the limit as t  →    ∞  . Equation [\eqref=badsoln_dR_T] is useful for checking that the expression satisfies the equation. While the integrands of these expressions are different, the integrals are equal and thus one may switch between them whenever convenient.

Imperfect thermal contact

Multiplying the boundary and interface conditions [\eqref=boundary1], [\eqref=boundary2], [\eqref=ip_jump1], [\eqref=ip_jump2] by eν2t and integrating the result from 0 to T with respect to t gives for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n where

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=t_jump1] and [\eqref=t_jump2] in [\eqref=badsoln_dR_T] we have

with 2  ≤  j  ≤  n.

We use [\eqref=t_jump1] and [\eqref=t_jump2] in the global relations [\eqref=GR_common_plus] and [\eqref=GR_common_minus] which gives where 2  ≤  j  ≤  n. Equation [\eqref=badsoln2] involves 2n + 4 unknown functions g(j)0(ν2,T),h(j)0(ν2,T),g(1)1(ν2,T),h(n)1(ν2,t) for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. However, these same unknown functions are related through the 2n + 2 global relations [\eqref=new_GRs] and the transformed boundary conditions [\eqref=t_boundary1] and [\eqref=t_boundary2]. Solving this linear system for the unknown functions amounts to solving the (2n + 4)  ×  (2n + 4) matrix problem

[formula]

where

The matrix A(ν) is made up of four (n + 2)  ×  (n + 2) blocks as indicated by the dashed lines. A11 has nonzero entries only on the main and + 1 diagonals, A12 has nonzero entries on the - 1 and - 2 diagonals, A21 has nonzero entries on the + 1 and + 2 diagonals, and A22 has nonzero entries on the main and - 1 diagonals. The boundary conditions are incorporated in the first and last rows of A(ν).

The matrix A(ν) is singular for isolated values of ν. Asymptotically, for large |ν|, the zeros of det (A(ν)) are on the real line [\cite=Langer]. Since asymptotically there are no zeros in D+R, a sufficiently large R may be chosen such that A(ν) is nonsingular for every ν∈D+R and [formula].

Every term in the linear equation A(ν)X(ν2,T) = Y(ν,T) is known. By substituting the solutions of this equation into [\eqref=badsoln2], we have solved the heat equation on the finite interval with n interfaces with imperfect interface conditions in terms of only known functions. It remains to show that the contribution to the solution from the linear equation A(ν)X(ν2,T) = Y(ν,T) is 0 when substituted into [\eqref=badsoln2].

To this end consider A(ν)X(ν2,T) = Y(ν,T). For the integral over ∂D+R we factor A(ν) = A(L, + )(ν)A(M, + )(ν) where

[formula]

For the integral over ∂D-R we factor A(ν) = A(L, - )(ν)A(M, - )(ν), where

[formula]

Let Aj(ν,T) be the matrix A(ν) with the [formula] column replaced by Y(ν,T). Similar to A(ν), this matrix can be factored as Aj(ν,T) = A(L,  ±  )(ν)A(M,  ±  )j(ν,T)ARj(ν,T) where ARj(ν,T) is the (2n + 4)  ×  (2n + 4) identity matrix with the (j,j) entry replaced by eν2T. Hence, det (Aj(ν,T)) = eν2T det (A(L,  ±  )(ν)) det (A(M,  ±  )j(ν,T)).

The terms we are trying to eliminate contribute to the solution [\eqref=badsoln2] in the form: for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1, and for 2  ≤  j  ≤  n with xj - 1 < x < xj. Using Cramer's Rule these become for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 1, and for 2  ≤  j  ≤  n. As usual in the UTM we use the large ν asymptotics to show the terms in [\eqref=badpart_minus] and [\eqref=badpart_plus] are 0. Observe the elements of A(M,  ±  ) are either 0, O(ν), or decaying exponentially fast for ν∈D± respectively. Hence,

[formula]

for large ν in D±R.

We begin by examining the first term of [\eqref=badpart_minus_a]. Expanding the determinant of A(M, - )j(ν,t) along the [formula] column we see that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are O(ν0) for large ν and xj - 1 < x < xj. Note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

decay exponentially fast for |ν|  →    ∞   from within D-R. Thus, by Jordan's Lemma, the integrals of [formula] and [formula] along a closed, bounded curve in the lower-half of the complex ν plane vanish for [formula]. In particular we consider the closed curve [formula] where [formula] and L-C  =  {ν∈D-R:|ν| = C}, see Figure [\ref=fig:heat_DRpm_close]

Similar to the argument on page , since the integral along L+C vanishes for large C, the integrals [\eqref=badpart_minus_a] must vanish since the contour LD+ becomes ∂D+ as C  →    ∞  . The uniform decay of the ratios of the determinants for large ν is exactly the condition required for the integral to vanish using Jordan's Lemma. This argument can be repeated for [\eqref=badpart_minus2]-[\eqref=badpart_plus2] Hence, the solution to [\eqref=heatgeneral] is [\eqref=badsoln2] where g(1)1(ν2,T),g(j)0(ν2,T),h(j)0(ν2,T), and h(n)1(ν2,T) for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1 are found by solving

[formula]

where A(ν),X(ν2,T), and Y(ν) are given in Equations [\eqref=Amatrix], [\eqref=X], and [\eqref=Y] respectively.

Perfect thermal contact

In this subsection we will repeat much of the analysis from [\ref=sec:imperfect] for different interface conditions and generalize what is presented in [\cite=DeconinckPelloniSheils] to n interfaces.

Multiplying the interface conditions [\eqref=p_jump1], [\eqref=p_jump2] by eν2t and integrating the result from 0 to T with respect to t gives for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Applying [\eqref=p_t_jump1] and [\eqref=p_t_jump2] in [\eqref=badsoln_dR_T] with 1  ≤  j  ≤  n.

We use [\eqref=p_t_jump1] and [\eqref=p_t_jump2] in the global relations [\eqref=GR_common_plus] and [\eqref=GR_common_minus] which gives where 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Equation [\eqref=p_badsoln2] involves 2n + 4 unknown functions g(j)0(ν2,T),g(j)1(ν2,T),h(n + 1)0(ν2,t),h(n + 1)1(ν2,t) for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n + 1. These functions are related through the 2n + 2 global relations [\eqref=p_new_GRs] and the transformed boundary conditions [\eqref=t_boundary1] and [\eqref=t_boundary2]. Solving this linear system for the unknown functions amounts to solving the (2n + 4)  ×  (2n + 4) matrix problem

[formula]

where and Y(ν,T), Y(ν,T) are as in [\eqref=Y] and [\eqref=badY].

The matrix A(p)(ν) is made up of four (n + 2)  ×  (n + 2) blocks as indicated by the dashed lines. A11 and A12 have nonzero entries only on the main and - 1 diagonals while A21 and A22 have nonzero entries on the main and + 1 diagonals. The boundary conditions are incorporated in the first and last rows of A(p)(ν).

As before, every term in the linear equation A(p)(ν)X(p)(ν2,T) = Y(ν,T) is known. By substituting the solutions of this equation into [\eqref=p_badsoln2], we have solved the heat equation on the finite interval with n interfaces with perfect interface conditions in terms of only known functions. The contribution to the solution from the linear equation A(p)(ν)X(p)(ν2,T) = Y(ν,T) is 0 when substituted into [\eqref=p_badsoln2] just as in Section [\ref=sec:imperfect].

Numerics

The UTM solutions presented here can be numerically implemented in a simple way using, for instance, MatLab. The author has done this and her code can be downloaded from . A few points regarding the implementation are of note. First, following [\cite=FlyerFokas] we parameterize D±R as ±  i sin (π / 8 - iθ) respectively. This has the advantage of exponential decay of the integrands for both x and t and the points are spaced closer together near the origin. Numerically, we only need to integrate for approximately - 10  ≤  θ  ≤  10 since for θ outside this range the integrand is 0 to machine precision. Second, in our MatLab implementation, we chose to scale Y(ν,T) by multiplying it by e-  ν2t. This greatly improves the numerical accuracy. Third, for large enough values of ν, entries of A(ν) and Ap(ν) are too large to be represented in MatLab. In this case, rather than solving the linear system, we use a shape-preserving piecewise cubic Hermite polynomial to interpolate from the values for [formula] and [formula] we already have to those we still need to compute. The code written by the author could certainly be further optimized to reduce the time it takes to run. However, since our code confirms the accuracy of the very fast "semi-analytical" method due to [\cite=CarrTurner], we propose our method as a benchmark rather than a replacement. This is especially true in the cases where their analytical method does not work (n > 9).

In the first example we compare our solution with the exact solution. In the second, fourth, and fifth examples we compare our solution to the one found using the code written by Carr and Turner [\cite=CarrTurner]. A notable difference between our method and that of [\cite=CarrTurner] is in the case of time-dependent boundary conditions as in Example [\ref=exC]. By making a transformation which makes the problem forced and alters the initial condition one can remove any time-dependence in the boundary conditions. However, it is not clear how one would make this change in the code presented in [\cite=CarrTurner]. In our code, the ability to use time-dependent boundary conditions is built in.

In this manuscript we present six examples. All times are for a 2014 MacBook Pro with a 2.8 GHz core.

The first example is run as a test since we can solve the problem exactly using a Fourier series solution. We choose n = 2, σj = 1 for j = 1,2,3 and the xj evenly spaced between 0 and 1 with perfect thermal contact. Initially u(x,0) = x3 and the boundary conditions are u(0,t) = 0 and u(1,t) = 1. This example took 45.036422 seconds to run. The relative error

[formula]

where u(xj,t) is the solution found using the UTM method evaluated at grid points (xj,t) and U(xj,t) is the exact solution found using a Fourier series. Our method is faulty near the end points (x = x0,xn + 1) whenever the boundary conditions are nonhomogenous. Thus, in the computation of the error we will omit the grid points x0 and xn + 1. However, the solution in Figure [\ref=fig:exA] does show the UTM solution evaluated at these grid points. The results are summarized in Table [\ref=t:errorA].

Although our method takes longer to evaluate it is much more accurate than the semi-analytical method proposed in [\cite=CarrTurner] and is similar in accuracy to the "analytical" approach they propose. Further, as shown in the following examples, our method works when their analytical method fails.

In Figure [\ref=fig:exA] the true solution is plotted as a solid line in black and the computed solution is plotted as a dashed line in red.

In the case when u(x0,t) = 0 and u(xn + 1,t) = 0 such as Example [\ref=exA] with u(1,t) = 0 the relative error is computed on all grid points (including x0 = 0 and xn + 1 = 1) and the error (as summarized in Table [\ref=t:errorA2]) is the same for the analytical method of [\cite=CarrTurner] and the UTM.

In this example we take n = 9, σj = 1 for j = 1,3,5,7,9, and [formula] for j = 2,4,6,8. We let u(x,0) = 0, u(0,t) = 1 and u(1,t) = 0. Again, the xj are evenly spaced and we assume perfect thermal contact. This example is the same as Example C in [\cite=CarrTurner]. In Figure [\ref=fig:exB] our code took 75.501220 seconds to evaluate (red dashed line) while the semi-analytical method due to [\cite=CarrTurner] took 1.361871 seconds (solid blue line), and their analytical method took 2.116983 seconds (green circles).

In this example we take n = 3, [formula], [formula], [formula], and σ4 = 1. We let u(x,0) = 1, u(0,t) =  cos (t) and u(1,t) + ux(1,t) = 0. Again, the xj are evenly spaced and we assume perfect thermal contact. In Figure [\ref=fig:exC] our code took 53.407197 seconds to evaluate (red solid line). The code provided in [\cite=CarrTurner] does not readily adapt to time-dependent boundary conditions.

This example is the same as Example B except that ux(1,t) = 0 and we assume imperfect thermal contact with Hj = 1 / 2 for [formula]. This example is the same as Example D in [\cite=CarrTurner]. In Figure [\ref=fig:exC] our code took 53.092184 seconds to evaluate (red dashed line) while the semi-analytical method due to [\cite=CarrTurner] took 0.849591 seconds (blue solid line).

For this example we take n = 199, [formula] for [formula]. We let u(x,0) = 1, u(0,t) = 1 / 2 and u(1,t) = 0. Again, the xj are evenly spaced and we assume perfect thermal contact. This example is the same as the macroscopic modeling example in [\cite=CarrTurner]. In Figure [\ref=fig:exE] our code took 2067.976494 seconds to evaluate (red dashed line) while the semi-analytical method due to [\cite=CarrTurner] took 8.078391 seconds (blue solid line).

In our final example we take n = 199, [formula] for [formula]. We let u(x,0) = x, ux(0,t) = 0 and u(1,t) = 0 The xj are evenly spaced and we assume imperfect thermal contact with Hj = 1 / 2 for [formula]. In Figure [\ref=fig:exF] our code took 1064.144519 seconds to evaluate (red dashed line) while the semi-analytical method due to [\cite=CarrTurner] took 5.075486 seconds (solid blue line).
