Many body localization in two dimensional square and triangular lattices

Introduction

The context of the localization phenomena addressed by P.W. Anderson in 1958 was the understanding of the conductivity of electrons in solids. In particular, Anderson studied the diffusion of a single particle traveling in an infinite disordered lattice in three dimensions [\cite=Anderson]. As a consequence of the coherent back scattering process not only the phase, but also the amplitude of the single particle wave function becomes affected. The main result of such seminal work, was to demonstrate that localization or absence of diffusion occurs for critical values of the disorder strength, being the most distinctive signature of such phenomena the exponentially decaying behavior of the single particle wave function envelope. Later in 1974, Thouless considered the role of the system size and established a correspondence among the conductivity, the energy spectrum and the system size. [\cite=Thouless] [\cite=Licciardello].

In addition to the influence that disorder and scaling, namely dimensionality and size, have in determining the conductance properties in a macroscopic material, another unavoidable aspect present in real solids are the interactions between particles, that even in the low temperature regime, dramatically modify the behavior of the transport properties. In 1949 N. Mott [\cite=Mott] showed that when correlations between electrons become strong in presumably metallic systems, half-filled energy bands appear transforming metallic systems into insulators. Although there is an extensive literature dealing with transport and localization phenomena [\cite=Abrahams] [\cite=Lee] [\cite=Gornyi] [\cite=Huse] [\cite=Delande], still open questions remain regarding dimensionality against interactions.

Now a days ultracold neutral gases are perhaps the most simplified scenario to address the study of transport properties, compared to their analogous electrically charged particles within the condensed matter scheme. As it is well known, each aspect intervening in either dynamical and stationary properties may be externally controlled in the case of neutral atoms. Superfluid-Mott insulating transition and Anderson localization phenomena have been experimentally tested in Fermionic [\cite=Liu] [\cite=Jordens] [\cite=Goldman] [\cite=Cao] and bosonic [\cite=Roati] [\cite=Sanchez-Palencia] systems loaded in optical lattices, and more recently, the interplay of disorder and many body interactions has been analyzed in a Bose gas confined in a two dimensional space [\cite=Bloch]. In particular, the impediment towards equilibrium caused by disorder and many body interactions was investigated in that experiment. From the theoretical perspective there is also an extensive amount of literature addressing the study of transport in optical lattices [\cite=Review-Bloch] [\cite=Qian] [\cite=Raizen] [\cite=Metcalf]. The standard schemes used to describe the referred transitions are the extended full quantum Bose-Hubbard (EBH) model and the hybrid EBH model within the decoupling approach. However, due to the degeneracy associated to dimensionality and number of particles, the size of Hilbert space grows enormously, thus making impracticable to deal with. Therefore another descriptions circumventing the many body problem must be used. The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation is precisely the most suitable scheme to describe the ground state of a weakly interacting Bose gas. Despite that fact that fluctuations in the number of particles are always poissonian in GP calculations, such a mean field approach allow us to investigate either stationary or dynamical transport properties in superfluids away from the regime of insulating states, such as a Mott insulator.

In this work we study the localization phenomena in a gas of interacting Bose atoms confined in disordered square and triangular lattices in two dimensions (see Fig. [\ref=Fig1]). The gas being in its condensate phase is described through GP equation. In particular, we determine the stationary states as a function of the disorder magnitude for a fixed value of the two-body contact interaction. From the analysis of the stationary density profiles we calculate the average localization length and the energy spectrum as a function of disorder. Our mean field study allowed us to reach the conclusion that localization phenomena is indeed present in two dimensional systems, being the triangular geometry favorable against the square one in attaining exponentially localized states.

This work is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the system model and set the parameters used for the calculations. In section 3, from the stationary density profiles, we determine the average localization length as a function of the disorder for both geometries square and triangular. In section 4 we analyze the energy spectrum and found that associated to the disorder present in the finite size lattices, the discrete levels levels acquire a finite width. Finally in section 5 a summary of this work is given.

Gross-Pitaevskii equation for disordered potentials

The system under study consist of an interacting gas of bosonic atoms confined in a two dimensional lattice, subjected to a static random disorder. In Fig. [\ref=Fig1] we illustrate a realization of disorder in a square lattice. To model the interactions between particles we assume onsite contact interactions scaled through the effective interaction strength g = 4π2asc / m that is written in terms of the s-wave scattering length asc and the atomic mass m. As it is well known, this approximation is valid at sufficiently low temperatures, low densities and weak interactions. To analyze the effect of the disorder in the interacting Bose gas, we consider GP equation,

[formula]

for the amplitude of the interacting Bose gas. In this equation N is the total number of particles composing the condensate and the potential. V(x,y) is given by a two dimensional disordered lattice with square or triangular symmetry,

[formula]

where the parameter δ is a random quantity varying in the interval

[formula]

Localization in two dimensional lattices

In this section we study the stationary states of equation ([\ref=GPE]) as a function of the disorder strength δ for a fixed value of the interaction coefficient U = Ng for both square and triangular lattices. That is, we solve numerically the time independent GP equation for several values of the disorder and determine the density profile to investigate the existence of localized states. For this purpose we consider lattices of size Ω  =  n  ×  n, with n = 5,9,11 and 25 in the case of square lattices, and Ω  =  76 and 126 sites in the case of triangular lattices. In order to have meaningful quantities in terms of the disorder amplitude, for a given size of the lattice Ω, we consider sets of 30 realizations of random numbers for each value δmax. That is, for a given disorder amplitude δmax the lattice amplitude at each point changes in the interval

[formula]

. It is found that the value of the average localization length in the case of triangular lattice is smaller than that of a square lattice. This can be understood in terms of the coordination number of the system. The number of nearest neighbors is larger in the triangular case (z = 6) with respect to the square lattice (z = 4), thus the difference in topology of the lattices induces a change in mobility between the atoms. As there are more neighbors to each density peak there is a local compression effect, leading to a smaller mean localization length. As the disorder amplitude δ is further increased, the average of the localization length reaches a stationary value in both lattice topologies, see Fig.[\ref=Fig4].

To complement our analysis we investigate the effect of harmonic confinement in disordered lattices. We found that exponentially localized states appear at the center of the lattice, that is, peaks surrounding the origin of the harmonic trap become visible, for values of disorder strength smaller than those at which localization occurs in the absence harmonic confinement. As the value of the harmonic frequency is increased, the number of peaks at the center diminish, until just one peak remain for meaningful values of the harmonic frequency. Summarizing, harmonic confinement works together with disorder to produce localization at the center of the trap.

Energy spectrum

In this section we investigate the energy spectrum of the stationary states analyzed above. To proceed we consider the energy associated to the stationary GP equation as a function of the disorder strength δ and a fixed value of the mean field interaction g,

[formula]

being the disorder included in the expression for square and triangular lattices Vsq(x,y), Vtr(x,y) written above. The integrand is the energy density in real space. To find the energy density in the reciprocal space, namely the energy spectrum, we first rewrite the kinetic term in a quadratic form,

[formula]

Then, the Parseval theorem can be used to reach the final form for the energy spectrum [\cite=Nore]

[formula]

For all of our numerical calculations we work within the first Brillouin zone. For square lattices [formula], while for triangular lattices the first Brillouin zone is the area of the primitive cell in the reciprocal lattice space generated by vectors [formula] and [formula]. In Fig. [\ref=Fig5] we show, in the reciprocal space, density plots of the energy spectra for two values of disorder, for either, square and triangular lattices. It is important to point out that the information displayed in this panel can be compared with direct experimental measurements. We observe from this panel that the main effect of disorder on the energy spectrum is that structure become visible compared with the case of no disorder. Figs. [\ref=Fig6] and [\ref=Fig7] summarize the full energy spectra as a function of the disorder strength for square and triangular lattices respectively. As can be appreciated from those figures the finite size of the two dimensional lattices produce energy levels having a level width. The influence of disorder in the energy spectrum is manifested as giving rise to a larger number of energy levels.

Final remarks

We have studied an interacting Bose gas at low temperatures confined in a two dimensional disordered lattice. The considered lattices have two different geometries, square and triangular. In particular, we concentrate in determining the influence of the disorder, as its magnitude is varied, on the existence of stationary localized states. For this purpose we work within the mean field scheme and solve numerically the GP equation that describes a non ideal Bose-Einstein condensate. For our analysis we considered lattices of size Ω  =  25,81,121 and 625 sites for square lattices and Ω  =  76 and 126 sites for triangular lattices. We found that localized states in form of exponentially form functions appear, either in square and triangular lattices, starting from a value of the disorder strength. For a given value of the disorder amplitude, the number of peaks observed in the density profile are on average the same. We also found that although several peaks in a given realization have variable height, its localization length is the same. Summarizing, different realizations of disorder having the same amplitude produce similar results. We also analyzed the influence of the harmonic confinement in the occurrence of localized states. We found that harmonic confinement enhances the localization phenomena in disordered lattices in two dimensions.

The present work provides an insight into the understanding of the localization phenomena in two dimensional interacting systems for two different geometries, square and triangular lattices. Due to the intrinsic nature of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the quantities that characterize the localization phenomena, namely the average localization length and the energy spectrum, do not capture finite size effects. However the information displayed in the energy spectra in the reciprocal space can be compared with direct experimental measurements. Further investigations of transport phenomena can be addressed with the approach followed in the present work, for instance, it could be considered different disorder in directions x and y, that is, setting δx  ≠  δy, which, in view of the results here obtained, could give rise to the formation of stripes where transport is inhibited. In addition, another lattices as the graphene structure, can be explored to investigate transport properties.
