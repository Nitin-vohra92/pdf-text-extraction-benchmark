Distance rationalization of social rules

Introduction

The number of possible social choice rules is huge, and even the number of those singled out in the literature for analysis is large. Researchers have tried many different axioms in order to classify and characterize these rules, sometimes leading to impossibility theorems. New rules are still being introduced, and the subject is far from tidy.

A promising unifying framework is that of distance rationalization (abbreviated DR), whereby some subset D (the consensus set) of the set of elections is distinguished. That subset is further partitioned into finitely many subsets, on each of which there is a different social outcome. We choose a distance measure d on elections, and for each election E outside D, an outcome is chosen socially if and only if it is chosen in some election in D minimizing the distance under d to E. This approach "decomposes" a rule into simpler components D and d.

Although the basic idea is quite old (arguably going back to Condorcet's maximum likelihood approach to voting), systematic study of this approach began with Nitzan, Lerer and Campbell [\cite=Nitz1981] [\cite=LeNi1985] [\cite=CaNi1986]. Their work shows that almost every known rule can be represented in the DR framework, and the main interest in the subject is when we can choose the distance and consensus notions to be natural and computationally tractable. More recently, Elkind, Faliszewski, and Slinko [\cite=EFS2012] [\cite=EFS2015] [\cite=ES2015] have further developed the theory, following Meskanen and Nurmi [\cite=MeNu2008]. In particular, they have focused on the important class of votewise distances and obtained useful sufficient conditions on (D,d) so that the induced rule satisfies desirable properties such as monotonicity, anonymity, and homogeneity.

Our contribution

We deal with several foundational and definitional issues, many of which have not been discussed by previous authors (in some cases because the level of generality they used was not sufficient to distinguish these concepts). Some of our contribution consists of a more efficient and rigorous presentation of known material. Section [\ref=s:defs] develops the basic notation and terminology. Our approach is similar to that taken by previous researchers, but there are some improvements. We aim to operate generally (for example, by using a hemimetric rather than a metric, and considering social choice and social welfare functions in a single analysis), and explicitly distinguish several concepts that have sometimes been conflated in previous work. In Section [\ref=s:foundation] we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a rule to be distance rationalizable, improving slightly on results of the abovementioned authors. We pose an interesting question regarding uniqueness of representation in the DR framework, which does not appear to have been noticed before. We give a counterexample in Section [\ref=ss:unique].

In Section [\ref=s:quot] we explain how equivalence relations and symmetries between elections allow us to describe DR rules more compactly, and make the connection between the original profile-based definitions and the quotient representations explicit. The distinction between compatible and totally compatible distances is important and new, and the idea of a distance being simple with respect to an equivalence relation is also new as far as we know. None of our results in this section rely on the distance being votewise and are proved for general consensuses; the applications therefore generalize results of Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2015]. In particular, we make the connection between [formula]-votewise distances and the Earth Mover distance, relating the subject of distance rationalization of anonymous rules to the theory of optimal transportation and maximum weight matchings. We believe that this new connection will prove fruitful in future work.

We apply the above results to neutrality and anonymity, obtaining complete characterizations in Propositions [\ref=prop:neut] and [\ref=prop:anon]. In Section [\ref=s:homog] we deal with homogeneity, which is not quite covered by the results on groups. Our approach shows that the reason Dodgson's rule is not homogeneous is because the equivalence relation is induced by the action of a monoid ("group without inverses") that is not a group.

Specializing to votewise distances, we concentrate in Section [\ref=s:VMP] on what we term the Votewise Minimizer Property, which is a way of requiring the consensus and distance to combine well. This allows us to give improved sufficient conditions for DR rules to satisfy homogeneity, consistency, and continuity.

Basic definitions

We use standard concepts of social choice theory. Not all of these concepts have completely standardized names. We shall need to deal with several candidate and voter sets simultaneously, which explains the generality of our definitions. However in many cases it suffices to deal with a fixed finite voter and candidate set.

We fix an infinite set [formula] of potential and an infinite set [formula] of potential . Let C  ⊆  C*. For each s  ≥  1, an is a strict linear order of s elements chosen from C. The set of all s-rankings is denoted Ls(C). When C is finite and s  =  |C|, we write simply L(C). When s = 1, we identify L1(C) with C in the natural way.

When C is finite, of size m say, the set Ls(C) consists of strict linear orderings of C and has size [formula]. By fixing a default linear ordering on C, we can interpret elements of Ls(C) as partial permutations of C in the usual way.

A is a function π:V  →  L(C) where V  ⊂  V* and C  ⊂  C* are finite. We denote the set of all profiles by P. An is a triple (C,V,π) with π∈P and π:V  →  L(C). We denote the set of all elections with fixed C and V by E(C,V), and the set of all elections by E.

By definition π(v)∈L(C) for each v∈V. If C is linearly ordered as described above, then π(v)- 1 denotes the inverse permutation, and for each c∈C, r(π(v),c): = π(v)- 1(c) gives the rank of c in v's preference order.

Of course, C and V are implicit in the definition of π, so strictly speaking an election is completely determined by a profile. We distinguish the two concepts because we sometimes want to deal with several different voter or candidate sets at the same time, and because C is not really completely determined -- any superset of C would also work.

A is a function R that takes each election E  =  (C,V,π) to a nonempty subset of Ls(C). When there is a unique s-ranking chosen, the word "rule" becomes "function". When s = 1, we have the usual , and when s = m the usual .

For each subset D of E we can consider a to be defined as above, but with domain restricted to D. We denote the domain of a partial social rule R by D(R). If R and R' are partial social rules such that D(R)  ⊆  D(R') and R(E)  =  R'(E) for all E∈D(R) then we say that R' R.

Most previous work has dealt only with the cases s = 1 and s = m.

Consensus

Intuitively, a consensus is simply a socially agreed unique outcome on some set of elections. We now define it formally.

An s- is a partial social function K of size s. The domain D(K) of K is called an and is partitioned into the inverse images Kr: = K- 1({r}).

Note that we allow Kr to be empty. This happens rarely for natural rules in the distance rationalizability framework, because it implies that there is no election for which r is the unique social choice. However it is technically useful and allows us to deal with varying sets of candidates.

It often makes sense to ensure coherence between the various values of s for which we formalize a given consensus notion.

Let K be a 1-consensus. For each s we define an s-consensus K(s) (the of K) as follows. For each candidate c, Kc is defined. Given E = (C,V,π)∈E, define E- c to be the election [formula], where π' is obtained from π by erasing c from each ranking.

Let D2 be the set of all elections E such that both E = (C,V,π) and E- c both belong to the domain of K, where c  =  K(E). Letting c'  =  K(E- c), define K(2) on D2 by its output, the 2-ranking cc'. Continue by induction, reducing the domain at each step if necessary, and output a single s-ranking.

Several specific consensuses have been described in the literature. Here we unify the presentation of several of the most common ones.

(qualified majority consensus)

Let 1 / 2  ≤  α  <  1. The [formula] is the s-consensus with domain consisting of all elections with the following property: there is some fraction p > α of the voters, all of whom agree on the order of the top s candidates. The consensus choice is this common s-ranking.

Special cases:

When α  =  1 / 2, we obtain the usual [formula].

The limiting value as α  →  1 gives the case of unanimity. We denote this by [formula]. When s = |C|, we simply write [formula] (called the ), whereas when s  =  1, for consistency with previous authors we denote it [formula], the .

In general, the s-restriction of [formula] is not [formula]: if a majority rank a first, and a majority of those rank b above all candidates other than a, it is not necessarily the case that a majority of votes have ab at the top (the fraction is more than 2α  -  1, however). However, a majority of the original voters rank b either first or second. The s-restriction is the consensus for which more than fraction α of voters agree on the top candidate, more than α agree on the top two, etc.

However, [formula] is indeed the s-restriction of [formula]: if all voters rank a first and all rank b over all candidates other than a, then all agree on the ranking ab, etc.

(qualified Condorcet consensus)

Let 1 / 2  ≤  α  <  1. The α- [formula] has domain consisting of all elections for which an α-Condorcet winner exists. That is, there is a (necessarily unique) candidate c such that for any other candidate c', a fraction strictly greater than α of voters rank c over c'.

We define [formula] to be the s-restriction of [formula].

Special cases:

When α  =  1 / 2 we denote this by [formula], the usual Condorcet consensus.

When α  →  1, we obtain [formula].

Distances

We require a notion of distance on elections. We aim to be as general as possible.

(distance) A (or ) on E is a function [formula] that satisfies the identities

d(x,x)  =  0,

d(x,z)  ≤  d(x,y)  +  d(y,z).

A is a distance that also satisfies

d(x,y)  =  d(y,x).

A is a distance that also satisfies

d(x,y)  =  0  ⇒  x  =  y.

A is a distance that is both a quasimetric and a pseudometric. We call a distance if d(E,E')  =    ∞   whenever E and E' have different sets of voters or candidates (this term has not been used in previous literature).

Votewise distances

One commonly used class of distances consists of the distances formalized in [\cite=EFS2015], which we now define after some preliminary work. They are each based on distances on L(C). See [\cite=Diac1988] for basic information about metrics on the symmetric group.

A on a real vector space X is a real-valued function N satisfying the identities

N(x + y)  ≤  N(x) + N(y)

N(λx)  =  |λ|N(x)

for all x,y∈X and all [formula]. Note that this implies that N(0)  =  0 and N(x)  ≥  0 for all x∈X.

A is a seminorm that also satisfies

N(x)  =  0  ⇒  x = 0.

Every seminorm induces a pseudometric via d(x,y)  =  ||x - y||. This is a metric if and only if the seminorm is a norm.

(votewise distances)

Choose a family {Nn}n  ≥  1 of seminorms, where Nn is defined on [formula]. Fix candidate set C and voter set V, and choose a distance d on L(C). Extend d to a function on P(C,V) by taking n  =  |V| and defining for σ,π∈P(C,V)

[formula]

This yields a distance on elections having the same set of voters and candidates. We complete the definition of the extended distance (which we denote by dN) on E by declaring it to be standard.

We use the abbreviation dp for [formula], and sometimes we even use just d for dN if the meaning is clear.

Note that if d is a metric and N is a norm, then dN is a metric.

Tournament distances

Some distances depend only on the net support for candidates.

Combining consensus and distance

In order for a rule to be definable via the DR construction, it is necessary that the first following property holds. The second property avoids trivialities and ensures some theorems in Section [\ref=s:foundation] are true. We shall assume both properties from now on.

Let d be a distance on E and K a consensus. Say that (K,d) if whenever x∈Kr,y∈Kr' and r  ≠  r', then d(x,y)  >  0.

We use a distance to extend a consensus to a social rule in the natural way. The choice at a given election E consists of all s-rankings r whose consensus set Kr minimizes the distance to E. We introduce the idea of a score in order to use our intuition about positional scoring rules.

(DR scores and rules)

Suppose that K is an s-consensus and d a distance on E. Fix an election E∈E. The of r∈Ls(C*) is defined by

[formula]

The rule [formula] is defined by

[formula]

We say that R is (DR) with respect to (K,d).

Note that if Kr is empty, then |r|  =    ∞  . DR scores are defined so that they are nonnegative, and higher score corresponds to larger distance. This is not consistent with the usual scoring rule interpretation in Example [\ref=eg:scoring], but the two notions of score are closely related. Our DR scores have the form M  -  s where s is the score associated with the scoring rule and M depends on E but not on any r∈Ls(C).

Some specific rules

Table [\ref=t:DR_egs] presents a few known rules in this framework. Most of the rules in the table are well known. We single out the following less obvious references. The was investigated by Caragiannis, Procaccia and Shah [\cite=CPS2014]. The (VRR) was defined essentially as a missing entry in such a table [\cite=EFS2012]. The entries marked "trivial" are so labelled because in those cases every election not in K is at distance +    ∞   from every Kr. Missing entries reflect on the authors' knowledge, and may have established names. Our table overlaps with that in [\cite=MeNu2008] -- note that the [formula] entry is incorrect in that reference, as pointed out by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2012]. Our table also overlaps one presented by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2015].

Note that dw is a metric on Ls(C) if and only if [formula] are all distinct. The score of r under the rule defined by w is the difference nw1  -  |r|. For example, for Borda with m candidates (corresponding to [formula], the maximum possible score of a candidate c is (m - 1)n, achieved only for those elections in [formula]. The score of c under Borda is exactly (m - 1)n  -  K where K is the total number of swaps of adjacent candidates needed to move c to the top of all preference orders in π(E).

Plurality (corresponding to [formula]) and Borda are special cases, where dw simplifies to d1H and d1S respectively. As far as the distance to [formula] or [formula] is concerned, d1S and d1K are proportional, but they are not proportional in general [\cite=MeNu2008].

Consider the set of all elections for which all positional scoring rules yield the same unique winner. By convexity of the set of weight vectors, it suffices to check the finite set of rules defined by weight vectors [formula] where the number of 1's is fixed and at most k - 1; in other words the for 1  ≤  k  ≤  m - 1. This just describes the Lorenz consensus in another way.

Every rule [formula], where K is a 1-consensus, automatically yields a social rule [formula] of size s as follows.

Let 1  ≤  s  ≤  m and suppose that K is a 1-consensus and d a distance on E. We define a social rule [formula] of size s by choosing s elements in increasing order of score (if there are ties in the scores, we consider all possible such orderings).

[formula] is single-valued if and only if the lowest s scores of candidates are distinct. Note that if the s-consensus K' is a restriction of the 1-consensus K, it is not necessarily the case that [formula]. For example, [formula] is a restriction of [formula], and [formula] is the social choice rule, Borda's rule. By above, we can also define the social welfare version of Borda's rule. However, [formula] is Kemeny's rule. The social choice rule obtained by taking the top element of the ranking given by Kemeny's rule is also sometimes called Kemeny's rule. All four rules mentioned here are different.

Existence and uniqueness

The DR framework is not very restrictive without further assumptions on K and d, as shown by Campbell and Nitzan [\cite=CaNi1986].

Existence

We give necessary and sufficient conditions, an improvement on [\cite=CaNi1986] and [\cite=EFS2015].

For each rule R, there is a unique Kmax(R), namely that whose consensus set Dmax consists of all elections on which R gives a unique output, which we define as the consensus choice.

Most rules commonly used in practice have ties, so that the domain of Kmax(R) is smaller than the domain of R. For example, if a social choice rule satisfies anonymity (symmetry with respect to voters) and neutrality (symmetry with respect to candidates) and is faced with a profile containing exactly one of each possible preference order, it must select all candidates as winners.

The of an s-rule R is the set of all r∈Ls(C) which occur as the unique winner in some election. That is, there exists E∈E such that R(E)  =  {r}. The of the rule is the set of all r∈Ls(C) which occur as a winner in some election. That is, there exists E∈E such that r∈R(E). The rule satisfies if every r∈Ls(C) occurs as a unique winner somewhere -- in other words, the unique image of R equals Ls(C).

Although slightly confusing (the image should perhaps be a set of subsets rather than their union) this is the standard terminology for set-valued mappings in mathematics.

We need to rule out the possibility of an election being at infinite distance from all consensus elections. There is no problem with an election being equidistant from all nonempty consensus sets, but without this assumption, empty consensus sets will (by convention) also be at the same distance.

Say that (K,d) is if for each E∈E there is some r for which d(E,Kr)  <    ∞  .

Let K be a consensus and R a rule. There exists a nontrivial distance rationalization [formula] if and only if the following two conditions hold:

R extends K;

the image of R equals the image of K.

Furthermore, d can be chosen to be a metric.

The first condition is necessary: because of the assumption that K distinguishes consensus choices, if E∈Kr then d(E,Kr)  =  0 but d(E,F)  >  0 for all F∈Kr' and all r'  ≠  r. The second condition is necessary: the image of K is contained in the image of R because R extends K, and by the nontriviality assumption, if [formula] then r is not a winner at any election.

Now assume that the two conditions hold. Let d denote either of the first two distances in Example [\ref=eg:weird_dist] and let [formula]. We claim that S  =  R (note that rationalization is nontrivial because the distances are finite). Let E∈E. Since R extends K the result is immediate if E∈Kr for some r, because then R(E)  =  {r} and S(E)  =  {r} since d distinguishes consensus choices. Now suppose that E is not a member of Kr for any r. Note that d(E,Kr)  ≥  2 if [formula]. For each r∈R(E), by assumption r is in the image of K, so there is F∈Kr with d(E,F)  =  1 (for the first and third distances, or the second if |R(E)|  >  1) or F∈Kr with d(E,F)  =  0 (for the second distance, if |R(E)|  =  1). Thus S(E) is precisely the set of r for which r∈R(E), in other words S(E)  =  R(E).

Let R be a rule. There exists a distance d and consensus K such that [formula] if and only if the image of R equals its unique image.

Let K  =  Kmax(R). The image of K is precisely the unique image of R, and R clearly extends K, so this follows directly from Proposition [\ref=prop:gen].

In Proposition [\ref=prop:gen], if we assume that R and K satisfy nonimposition, then condition (ii) is satisfied. In this case R is distance rationalizable if and only if it extends K [\cite=CaNi1986]. In this case, the third distance from Example [\ref=eg:weird_dist] can be used. Note that in general the third distance does not work -- consider a rule for which only one consensus set Ka is nonempty, yet the rule returns a disjoint two-element set {b,c} at some election E. The third distance would then yield {a,b,c} at E, a contradiction.

However the assumption of nonimposition is not necessary -- consider the rule in which R(E)  =  {r} for every election E, and choose d to be the discrete metric.

Thus if K is specified, the question of existence is settled. For example, every social welfare rule satisfying the usual unanimity axiom (if every voter has the same preference order, the rule outputs precisely this common ranking) can be rationalized with respect to [formula].

In view of the flexibility of the DR framework, it is clear that the key idea is to make an appropriate choice of a "small" K and "natural" d so as to recapture rule R via [formula].

Uniqueness

We now turn to the question of uniqueness. The construction in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:gen] shows that changing both K and d can lead to the same rule. When K is fixed and d varies, the rule often changes. However it sometimes does not change, as can be seen from Table [\ref=t:DR_egs]. A general class of examples where the rule does not change is discussed in Section [\ref=ss:group].

Similarly, when d is fixed and K varies, the rule sometimes does not change. For example, consider Copeland's rule, which can be described as [formula]. It can also be described as [formula], because for each a∈C, every point of [formula] is at distance zero from [formula] with respect to dRT. The standard examples such as Borda's, Kemeny's, and Copeland's rules all behave well when we extend the consensus set beyond the one used to define them. This leads us to the following question: if R has the form [formula], and K' is a consensus that extends K, is it necessarily the case that [formula]? In particular, does [formula]? The answer is no in general, as we now show.

Quotients

Symmetries of voting rules occur very often in practice. In this section, we show how to express distance rationalization using only symmetric objects and functions. We start with general equivalence relations, then equivalence relations induced by actions of symmetry groups, and then consider special cases of such actions. In Sections  [\ref=ss:anon], [\ref=s:homog] and  [\ref=ss:neutral], we apply the general results to anonymity and homogeneity, neutrality and reversal symmetry.

We use a general equivalence relation ~   on E, which we shall specialize in later sections. All our definitions in this section are understood to be with respect to ~  . For example, we may refer to "compatibility" and "total compatibility" without mentioning ~   directly.

Let [formula] denote the equivalence class of E, and let Q denote the set of equivalence classes. The usual quotient map [formula] takes E onto Q.

Let R be a partial social rule. Then R is with ~   if R(E)  =  R(E') whenever [formula].

In usual mathematical terms, R is compatible with ~   if and only if it is an for ~   or a for ~  .

If R is compatible then we may define a mapping [formula] on Q via [formula] for every E∈E (it is well-defined precisely because of compatibility of R). We call [formula] a .

We shall apply this construction later, where ~   is the relation defining anonymity or homogeneity, in which case everything makes sense because the projection to the quotient space does not change the candidate sets. However, if the projection does affect the candidate sets (as with neutrality) the result may look strange and the interpretation rather uninteresting, although the theorems will be correct. For example, a rule compatible with the equivalence relation defining neutrality must be the constant rule which chooses the same r at every election, or the rule that chooses all possible r at every election. We discuss this more in Section [\ref=ss:neutral].

Totally compatible distances

A distance d is with ~   if d(E,E')  =  d(F,F') whenever [formula] and [formula].

In usual mathematical terms, d is totally compatible if and only if it is an invariant for the equivalence relation [formula] on E  ×  E for which (a,b)  ~  2(c,d) if and only if a  ~  c and b  ~  d. Provided that ~   is not contained in the identity relation (so some equivalence class has size greater than 1), a totally compatible d is not a quasimetric, because whenever [formula], necessarily d(E,E')  =  0.

A totally compatible distance relates directly to a distance on Q. The proof of the next result is immediate from the definitions.

The set of distances on Q and the set of totally compatible distances on E are in bijection under the map d  ↔  δ defined as follows. Given d, define [formula]. Given δ, define [formula].

We want to define DR rules on Q.

Let δ be a distance on Q and K a consensus on Q. The rule [formula] is defined using the analogue of [\eqref=eq:argmin].

The following conditions are equivalent for a social rule R on E.

R is compatible and distance rationalizable.

[formula] where K is compatible and d is totally compatible.

[formula] is distance rationalizable on Q.

Suppose that the first condition holds. We use the consensus K: = Kmax(R) from Definition [\ref=def:Kmax] (which is compatible because R is compatible). We can recapture R as [formula] by defining d to be the second distance in Example [\ref=eg:weird_dist]. Let [formula]. Then if E∈D(K), necessarily R'(E)  =  R(E). If [formula] then R'(E) is precisely the set of r for which r∈R(E), namely R(E). Thus R'  =  R. It remains only to check that d is totally compatible. Since d is defined in terms only of the images R(E) and R is compatible, this follows immediately.

Suppose that the second condition holds. Define [formula] (this is well-defined since d is totally compatible. Define [formula]. Then [formula].

Finally, suppose that the third condition holds. Define K,d by composing K,δ with the projection to Q. Then [formula] and R is compatible since [formula].

The distance and consensus used in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_compat] are rather unnatural (note that the first and third distances in Example [\ref=eg:weird_dist] would not even work, being metrics). We now consider more natural constructions that relate to the original distance and use the equivalence relation explicitly.

Quotient distances

When dealing with equivalence classes, the obvious idea is to use a quotient distance [\cite=DeDe2009]. This concept is relatively little-known.

We define [formula] to be the induced by ~  .

The standard construction of quotient distance [formula] is as follows:

[formula]

where the infimum is taken over all admissible paths, namely paths such that E'i  ~  Ei + 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, E = E1,E'  =  E'k, E projects to x and E' to y.

We now focus on a special situation where [formula] has a much simpler formula.

Let d be a distance on E. Define d̃ on Q by

[formula]

If d is totally compatible with ~  , then in the definition of d̃, all the distances on the right are the same, so that d̃(x,y)  =  d(E,E') whenever [formula].

A distance on E is for ~   if [formula].

Every totally compatible distance is simple, because in the definition of [formula] the minimum is achieved when k = 1 (use induction on k and the inequality d(E,E1')  +  d(E2,E2')  =  d(E,E1')  +  d(E1',E2')  ≤  d(E,E2')).

Non-simple distances do arise in our framework.

Let d be a simple distance and K a compatible consensus. Then for every r and E, [formula]. Thus if [formula] is compatible, then it satisfies [formula].

We have

[formula]

The first equality holds by definition of distance to a set, the second because d is simple, the third by definition of d̃, the fourth by compatibility of K and the fifth for the same reason as the first.

Now let [formula]. Then [formula] by above, for all E. If [formula] is compatible then [formula] exists and [formula] for all E. Thus [formula].

The condition that the distance be simple is necessary. For example, consider the setup of Example [\ref=eg:nonsimple], where the consensus sets have the form Exy.

The condition that [formula] is compatible is not always satisfied, as we see when studying homogeneity in Section [\ref=s:homog]. In Section [\ref=ss:group] we give sufficient conditions for it to be satisfied automatically.

Symmetry groups

Equivalence is a form of symmetry between elections. Proposition [\ref=prop:simple_compat] is clearly useful, but the only simple distances we have seen so far are totally anonymous ones, for which the result is obvious. We introduce a strengthening of equivalence that will yield simple distances. We apply it in later subsections to discuss anonymity, neutrality, reversal symmetry and homogeneity.

We recall some basics of the theory of group actions on sets. Let X be a set and G a subgroup of the group of all permutations of X. The of x∈X under G is the set of all g(x) as g ranges over G.

Let ~   be an equivalence relation on E and let G be a group acting on E via morphisms. In other words, for each g∈G, E  ~  E' implies g(E)  ~  g(E'). If the equivalence classes of ~   are precisely the orbits under the action of G, then we say ~   is G.

The distance d is if G acts via isometries:

[formula]

The partial social rule K is if R(g(E))  =  R(E) for all E∈D(K),g∈G.

Suppose that G is a group that induces ~   via an action on E. The following conditions are equivalent for a social rule R.

R is G-invariant and distance rationalizable.

[formula] where K is G-invariant and d is G-invariant.

[formula] where K is G-invariant and d is G-equivariant.

[formula] is distance rationalizable on Q.

The first, second and fourth parts are equivalent by Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_compat]. The second implies the third by definition. Suppose that the third condition holds. It remains to show that R is G-invariant. Fix arbitrary r and g∈G. Since K is G-invariant, g(Kr)  =  Kr. Then d(E,Kr) = d(g(E),g(Kr))  =  d(g(E),Kr). Thus R(E)  =  R(g(E)), yielding the second condition.

However, the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] does not give a relationship between the distances used in parts (ii) and (iii). We now proceed to clarify this. We first give an important sufficient condition for a distance to be simple.

Let G be a group, and suppose that ~   is induced by G, while d is G-equivariant. Then d is simple. Furthermore

[formula]

We show that for each x,y∈Q, the minimum value of k for paths achieving the minimum in [\eqref=eq:quot] is always 1. Assume that this is not the case, so there exist x,y, a minimum k > 1 and admissible paths such that

[formula]

Choose g,h∈G so that g(Ek)  =  E'k - 1 (possible since ~   is induced by G). Then by G-equivariance and the triangle inequality

[formula]

This contradicts the minimality of k, and this contradiction shows that d is simple. The other formulae for d̃ follow immediately, because all E' projecting to y are equivalent, so that each can map onto any other via some g.

Suppose that [formula] where K is G-invariant and d is G-equivariant. Then [formula].

R is G-invariant by Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant], so [formula] exists. By Proposition [\ref=prop:simple], d is simple. The result follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:simple_compat].

Also [formula] where d' is G-invariant and [formula]. In fact d'(E,E') equals the familiar quantity min g,g'∈Gd(g(E),g'(E')).

Neutrality and reversal symmetry

Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] does not apply to the study of these properties, because rather than R(g(E))  =  R(E), we want R(g(E))  =  g(R(E)): the output of the rule changes in a consistent way. This is because the group action changes the candidates, unlike the case with anonymity.

A social rule of size s is a mapping taking each election to a set of s-rankings. If a group G acts on the set of rankings, then there is a natural induced action on social rules: g(R) is the rule for which g(R)(E)  =  g(R(E)). If the group acts on s-rankings for all s, we can say more.

Suppose that G is a group acting on L(C*) such that it maps Ls(C*) to itself for every s. The partial social rule R is if the identity R(g(E))  =  g(R(E)) holds.

An example of this is . A social welfare rule satisfies reversal symmetry if turning all input rankings upside down also reverses the output. The group in question is the group of order 2, generated by g say. All our examples so far of distances on rankings have satisfied reversal symmetry.

Reversal symmetry has been defined for social choice rules as: if a is the unique winner in the original profile, then a is not a winner in the reversed profile. For example, the social welfare version of Borda's rule satisfies this. However for social choice rules which do not come from social welfare rules, this is inconsistent with our definition above. In the case of DR rules, there is no difficulty, because each social choice rule yields a social welfare rule as in Definition [\ref=def:score].

It is straightforward to prove an analogue of Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] that extends to the case of G-equivariant rules. We omit the details.

If K and d satisfy reversal symmetry then so does [formula]. Conversely, if R satisfies reversal symmetry then [formula] where K and d both do.

For example, since [formula] and d1K each satisfy reversal symmetry, so do the modal ranking rule and Kemeny's rule.

If a group G acts on C* then there is a natural induced action on s-rankings, whereby the ranking [formula] maps to [formula]. An example of this involves . In this case G the group of all permutations of the candidates. Neutrality is a very natural condition for consensuses and for distances, and is satisfied by all our main examples. It means that the identities of candidates are not relevant because each candidate is treated symmetrically.

Let K be a neutral consensus and d a neutral distance. Then [formula] is neutral. Conversely, if R is neutral and distance rationalizable then [formula] where K and d are neutral.

Anonymity

We now apply Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] directly. First we discuss the concept of anonymity. Several authors use a fixed finite voter set and define a rule to be anonymous if the rule is invariant under permutations of the set. This deals with the order of voters, but not their identities. On the other hand, allowing arbitrary identities leads us to issues of classes that are not sets, category theory, etc. Our convention that there is a single countably infinite set of voters allows us to deal both with the order and identity of voters.

We start with an example that explains the need to distinguish G-equivariance from total compatibility.

We can use the results of Section [\ref=ss:group] directly.

Let G be the group of all bijections of V*. For any set X, we define an action of G on functions in the usual way by g  ·  f(v)  =  f(g(v)). In particular for each C we can apply this to X  =  L(C). This allows us to define an action on E via g  ·  (C,V,π): = (C,g(V),g  ·  π). Let ~   be the equivalence relation induced by this action. A partial rule is if it is compatible with ~  . A distance is if it is G-equivariant, and if it is totally compatible with ~  .

We denote Q by V and call it the set of or .

An anonymous profile is completely determined by the numbers of voters having each preference order, and hence is encoded by a [formula] on L(C) of weight |V| (we call [formula] the -- note that E  ~  E' if and only if [formula]). A rule is anonymous if its output depends only on the anonymous profile, and not the particular voters or their order.

(Totally) anonymous distances

The next result is obvious, but useful. Part (ii) was observed by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2015].

The following results hold.

Every (reduced) tournament distance is totally anonymous.

A votewise distance is anonymous if and only if its underlying seminorm is symmetric.

A votewise distance based on a norm cannot be totally anonymous.

The first part is clear because the definition uses only the number of votes of each type. The second follows immediately from the definitions. For the third part, use the idea of Example [\ref=eg:anon_dist].

Anonymous DR rules

Because of the special form of the equivalence relation for anonymity (it does not touch the candidate sets), a partial social rule on V has a nice form. Indeed, many authors define voting rules directly on V. We simply define an anonymous rule in the DR framework by choosing a consensus notion K on V and a distance δ on V, and using the analogue of [\eqref=eq:argmin]. Because V can be described as multisets which correspond geometrically to histograms, this may allow us to create interesting anonymous rules using geometric intuition.

The next characterization, which follows directly from Propositions [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] and [\ref=prop:nice_dist], answers positively a question raised in [\cite=EFS2015].

If K and d are anonymous, then [formula] is anonymous and [formula]. Conversely if R is anonymous and distance rationalizable, then [formula] where K is anonymous and d' is totally anonymous.

This applies to all consensuses described so far, and to all votewise distances based on symmetric seminorms, in addition to tournament distances. Thus all rules in Table [\ref=t:DR_egs] are anonymous.

Note that elements of V can be encoded by multisets which are essentially histograms. A standard measure of distance between histograms is the or transportation distance. The interpretation in our situation, when d is anonymous and standard, is that we must move voter mass between types of voters while incurring the minimum cost (distance). In fact in this case d̃ is exactly the Earth Mover distance based on d. Computing it is a special case of the linear assignment problem of operations research. The minimum can be computed in polynomial time via the "Hungarian method" [\cite=Munk1957]. An equivalent formulation of the problem is to find a minimum weight matching in a bipartite graph.

Homogeneity

In this case we use a slightly different equivalence relation.

Let E  =  (C,V,π) be an election, where n = |V|. The associated to E is the probability distribution on L(C) induced by the multiset [formula], which we denote [formula]. The vote distribution map defines an equivalence relation ~   on E in the usual way. We denote the quotient space by P.

A rule is if and only if it is compatible with ~  . A distance is called if it is totally compatible with ~  .

In other words, for a homogeneous rule, the set of winners depends only on the probability distribution of voter types -- cloning each voter the same number of times makes no difference to the result. Our definition of homogeneity implies anonymity, because the equivalence relation used in this section refines the one used for anonymity. Some authors do not make it clear whether they consider homogeneous rules to be anonymous, because they give a definition in terms of profiles in which the cloned voters occupy a particular position. Of course, the two definitions are the same in the presence of anonymity.

It is important to note that ~   is not induced by a group action. Rather, there is a monoid (a "group without inverses") acting. On V there is an action of the positive integers under multiplication where for each x∈V, k  ·  x is the voting situation formed by adding k - 1 copies of each voter. A rule is homogeneous if it is anonymous and invariant under the action of this monoid. Thus, for example, starting with an election E and doubling or tripling the number of voters will lead to equivalent elections 2E,3E, but there is not necessarily any way to get from 3E to 2E via an element of the monoid, because of the lack of inverses. This has important consequences, as we now see.

The above remark shows that Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] does not necessarily apply to homogeneity. In fact the conclusion is known to be false.

The same example shows that [formula], the Voter Replacement Rule, is not homogeneous. In this case the limiting distances to [formula] and [formula] are 1.75 and 1.5, while the distances for the original E are both equal to 2.

In order to prove a result similar to Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant], we need a strong condition on K.

We call an anonymous consensus if every element of Kr with kn voters has the form kE where E has n voters. This is a very strong condition -- taking n = 1 shows that K is extended by [formula] (up to possible permutation of the winners).

We now generalize [\cite=EFS2015], which dealt with the case where [formula] and d is [formula]-votewise, based on an underlying pseudometric.

An anonymous distance on E is if for each k  ≥  1 and each E,E'∈E,

[formula]

A family of symmetric seminorms N is if Nnk(x(k))  =  Nn(x) for all [formula] and all k  ≥  1. Here x(k) denotes the element of [formula] obtained by concatenating k copies of x.

The reader should avoid confusion by noting that the term homogeneous is often used for the different property of a seminorm expressed by the identity N(λx)  =  |λ|N(x).

Let d be a standard distance and N a symmetric seminorm. Then dN can be normalized to be homogeneous. Explicitly, let dN*(E,E')  =  n- 1dN(E,E') where E  =  (C,V,π) and |V|  =  n. The DR rules defined by dN and dN* are the same, since we are only scaling the distance by a constant factor.

Let K be a homogeneous divisible consensus and d a homogeneous distance. Then [formula] is homogeneous.

The proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] adapts directly to this case, as described above.

Thus we recapture the well-known fact that Kemeny's rule [formula] is homogeneous. Proposition [\ref=prop:divis] shows, for example, that although Dodgson's rule can be rationalized with respect to [formula] and some distance (since Dodgson's rule satisfies the unanimity axiom), no such distance can be homogeneous.

The Votewise Minimizer Property

The failure of [formula] to inherit various conditions from K is related to the fact that minimization does not respect various operations. Roughly speaking, votewise distances combine better with votewise consensuses. We now make some technical (and rather strong) definitions that allow for several positive results when dealing with votewise distances.

Let K be a compatible consensus and d a compatible distance. Say that (K,d) has the (CMP) if for each E,E'∈E with E  ~  E' and each r, d(E,Kr)  =  d(E',Kr).

If ~   is induced by a group action then the CMP is automatically satisfied, as used in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant]. The analogue of Proposition [\ref=prop:DR_invariant] does not hold for general equivalence relations, as we see in Example [\ref=eg:dodgson]. However, with the additional assumption of the CMP, everything works well.

Let K be a compatible consensus and d a compatible distance, and suppose that (K,d) satisfies the CMP. Then [formula] is compatible.

Let E,E'∈E with E  ~  E'. By CMP, d(E,Kr)  =  d(E',Kr) for all r and in particular the minimizing values of r are the same.

Suppose that d is votewise and anonymous, and K is anonymous. Say that (K,d) satisfies the (VMP) if the following condition is satisfied.

If (K,d) satisfies the VMP, then

d(πi,π*i) has the form δ(t,ρ) for some function δ, where t,ρ∈L(C);

d(E,Kr) has the form N(S) where S is the multiset of all values of δ(t,ρ) counted with multiplicity.

This follows directly from the definitions.

Let K be an anonymous consensus and d a votewise anonymous and homogeneous distance. If (K,d) satisfies the VMP, then it satisfies the CMP with respect to the equivalence relation defining homogeneity.

For each E and r, there is a minimizer of d(E,Kr) for which the distance has the form N(S) where S is the multiset of values of d(πi,π'i) occurring. Thus it depends only on the equivalence class with respect to anonymity. By homogeneity of d, it in fact only depends on the equivalence class of with respect to homogeneity.

Example [\ref=eg:VMP_no] shows that the VMP is not always satisfied, and Proposition [\ref=prop:VMP] gives sufficient conditions for it to be satisfied.

Let d be an anonymous votewise distance on E. Suppose that the s-consensus K satisfies the following: for each r∈Ls(C), there is a nonempty subset Sr of L(C) such that Kr consists precisely of elections for which no voter has a ranking in Sr. Then (K,d) satisfies the VMP.

The minimizer in question is obtained by, for each i, choosing the closest element of L(C) under the underlying distance.

Homogeneity

So far we can only show homogeneity when using [formula]. We want to widen this to at least [formula]. We use a definition from Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2015].

We call a seminorm N if whenever 0  ≤  xi  ≤  yi for all i, N(x)  ≤  N(y).

Suppose that K is homogeneous, dN is votewise, anonymous and homogeneous, (K,dN) satisfies the VMP, and N is monotone in the positive orthant. Then [formula] is homogeneous.

Let E∈V and k  ≥  1. First note that d(E,Kr)  =  d(kE,kKr)  ≥  d(kE,Kr). We now prove the converse inequality.

By VMP, d(E,Kr)  =  N(S) where S is the multiset of values d(π,π*). Also by VMP and homogeneity, d(kE,Kr)  =  N(kS') where S' is the multiset of values d(π,π*  *) (here the minimizer may depend on k, so π*  * may not equal π*). Note that S' is elementwise at least as great as S, because π* is a minimizer. By homogeneity and monotonicity in the positive orthant, d(kE,Kr)  =  N(S')  ≥  N(S)  =  d(E,Kr), as required.

Proposition [\ref=prop:CMP] now gives the result.

If 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , then [formula] is homogeneous.

The case p  =    ∞   allows for stronger results [\cite=EFS2015].

Consistency

Consistency, introduced by Young [\cite=Youn1975], deals with the effect of splitting the voter set into two parts.

Let E  =  (C,V,π) and E'  =  (C,V',π')∈E where [formula]. We define [formula], where

[formula]

A partial social rule R is if whenever [formula], necessarily [formula].

A consensus is consistent if and only if each consensus set is closed under the +   operation.

The next result generalizes Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2015].

Suppose that K is consistent, d is votewise with respect to a homogeneous norm and (K,d) satisfies the VMP. Then [formula] is consistent.

Let E,E'∈E such that [formula]. We show that for all r there are minimizers m(E,r),m(E',r) and m(E + E',r) such that m(E,r)  +  m(E',r)  =  m(E + E',r). The result then follows just as in Proposition [\ref=prop:CMP].

The claim follows easily from the VMP. Because minimization of the distance to r occurs votewise, it respects the split into E and E'.

If 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , then [formula] is consistent.

Recall that Kemeny's rule is consistent when properly considered as a social welfare rule, but not when considered as a social choice rule (this point may potentially confuse readers of [\cite=EFS2015]).

Continuity

After fixing an arbitrary ordering on L(C), each partial social rule on [formula] of size 1 can be identified with an arbitrary function on an arbitrary nonzero subset of the rational points of the 6-simplex [formula], with image contained in C. Rules defined in this level of generality are not easy to deal with. Young [\cite=Youn1975] introduced the axiom of continuity.

An anonymous rule R is if when E  =  (C,V,π),E'  =  (C,V',π') and R(E)  =  {r} then R(kE  +  E')  =  {r} for all sufficiently large integers k.

If R is homogeneous then it is continuous if and only if every vote distribution sufficiently close to E in the [formula]-norm on [formula] yields the same output as E. We do not know of any voting rule seriously considered in the literature that is not continuous.

We now give a slight generalization of a result of Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko [\cite=EFS2015].

Suppose that K is continuous and homogeneous, d is votewise with respect to a continuous homogeneous seminorm and (K,d) satisfies the VMP. Then [formula] is continuous.

Let E = (C,V,π),E' = (C,V',π')∈E with R(E)  =  {r}. Thus there is F = (C,V,τ)∈Kr such that for all r'  ≠  r and all F'∈Kr', d(E,F)  <  d(E,F'). Note that d(E,F)  =  N(S) where S is the multiset of all d(πi,τi), and similarly d(E,F')  =  N(S').

Fix F'' = (C,V',π'')∈Kr. Then d(kE + E',kF + F'')  =  N(kS + S''). Also for d(kE + E',F') = N(kS' + T) for some T. By homogeneity of the norm and its continuity, we have for sufficiently large k, with ε: = |V'| / k, d(kE + E',kF + F'')  =  N(S + εS'')  <  N(S' + εT).

If 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , then [formula] is continuous.

Conclusions and future work

We have clarified the relationship between distance rationalizability and axiomatic properties of social rules, and given improved necessary and sufficient conditions for rules to satisfy several of these axioms. The results show clearly that votewise distances combine better with votewise consensuses (which we define as those satisfying the VMP). The more complicated structure of consensuses such as [formula] compared to [formula] is reflected in the failure of various properties to extend. Of course, VMP is a very strong property, and we do not know of consensuses other than [formula] that satisfy it generally. However VMP and CMP may be satisfied a particular (K,d) pair in a given application. What seems clear is that votewise distances work best with "votewise consensuses", and Condorcet consensus with tournament distances. Mixing the two yields rules such as Dodgson's and the Voter Replacement Rule which fail to satisfy basic properties such as homogeneity.

We have only a few sufficient conditions for homogeneity of a DR rule. If the rule is not homogeneous, a homogeneous rule similar to the original may be found. In [\cite=Fish1977] a way around the nonhomogeneity of Dodgson's and Young's rules was found, by using a limiting process to redefine the distance. This is unsatisfactory -- it is not even clear that the limit exists. Presumably using the construction [formula] may work, but it is not completely clear to us.

Systematic exploration of the space of rules [formula] where d is a neutral distance on rankings, may well unearth new rules with desirable properties. These rules are already known to be continuous, neutral, anonymous, homogeneous and consistent. Other possibly desirable properties may also be satisfied: Kemeny's rule, which falls into this class, also satisfies a Condorcet property for social welfare rules [\cite=YoLe1978] while scoring rules are also monotonic as social choice rules.

To our knowledge, [formula] votewise distances with 1  <  p  <    ∞   have not been studied systematically. Also, in addition to the discrete, inversion and Spearman metrics on rankings discussed here, there are many interesting distances on rankings yet to be explored. Besides votewise distances, there are many other interesting distances on V and P, which may yield useful new social rules. Such and are heavily used in many application areas [\cite=DeDe2009].

In a related forthcoming work, the present authors use the framework of distance rationalizability of anonymous and homogeneous rules to study the decisiveness of such rules. We expect other applications, for example by using different groups of symmetries.
