Leveraging Contact Network Information in Clustered Randomized Trials of Infectious Processes

Introduction

Infectious processes spread through specific contact ties between individuals. For any fixed time, these transmission routes constitute a network[\cite=frank1986][\cite=erdos1960][\cite=barabasi1999][\cite=watts1998][\cite=newman2010book]. For a deleterious infection, a treatment aims to reduce the probability of transmission from one node to another. For example, in the context of HIV, one strategy to reduce the overall rate of transmission is to test and treat all infected individuals, which is the goal of several ongoing clinical trials[\cite=gaolathe2016] [\cite=hayes2014] [\cite=chemie2014]. Other spreading processes propagate through specific ties between individuals, such as diffusive processes of ideas or practices[\cite=katz1963], and can also be modeled as an infectious process.

To determine if a treatment is effective, one might randomly assign some individuals to receive the treatment, and others to receive standard care or a placebo, which randomization ensures balance on average in the predictors between the two arms. This type of experiment is called a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). When this is not possible, a population of individuals may be available for observation in which two or more groups have different exposures related to the outcome, which can be made to resemble an RCT if all confounders are correctly adjusted for[\cite=rosenbaum2002][\cite=rosenbaum2010book]. In addition, interference occurs when an individual's outcome depends on the outcomes of other individuals in addition to exposure [\cite=hudgens2012]. This can be avoided by assuming that clusters of individuals are independent, and adjusting for the correlation of outcomes within clusters[\cite=murray1998book] [\cite=eldridge2012book] as well as the probability of exposure[\cite=rosenbaum2002]. Dependent outcomes within clusters generally results in a decrease in statistical power, or the probability of detecting an exposure effect if one exists, and this decrease can depend on epidemic dynamics as well as within-cluster network structure[\cite=staples2015].

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs)[\cite=zeger1986] are a semi-parametric approach for estimating a treatment effect in randomized trials when outcome data are correlated within clusters[\cite=murray1998book]. This approach produces unbiased estimates of the average marginal treatment effect across all clusters, whereas mixed effect models provide an estimated intervention effect conditional on adjustment covariates[\cite=hubbard2010]. Accounting for the correlation between baseline covariates and the outcome can improve the efficiency of treatment effect estimates, using either the augmented GEE[\cite=tsiatis2008] or other semiparametric approaches, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE)[\cite=vanderlaan2011]. When the exposure is not randomized, estimating the effect of exposure without bias requires that the propensity that each cluster is exposed to treatment be correctly estimated. Few studies of infectious processes so far use contact network information to improve statistical efficiency using these approaches[\cite=chemie2014].

This paper investigates the degree to which exposure effect estimates in simulated and empirical observational studies of epidemic processes are improved by adjusting for features of the contact networks and infections at baseline. Section 2 gives details on the network generation framework, infectious process, and the estimation procedures used to evaluate the effect of exposure while adjusting for network features. Section 3 details a series of simulations of observational studies using this framework. Section 4 applies this approach to an empirical dataset, treating the spread of a novel microfinance program as an infectious process in a collection of villages in Karnataka, India. Section 5 provides concluding remarks.

Methods

A simple network G consists of set of nodes N  =  {1,...,n} and edges E  ⊆  N  ×  N. The edges may be described in an adjacency matrix [formula] where element [formula] has value 1 if an edge exists between nodes j and j', and a 0 otherwise. One specific network model, the stochastic blockmodel[\cite=anderson1992_1], assumes that each node j belongs to only one block bj in a partition of nodes B  =  {1,...,B}. The complete set of node memberships may be represented compactly as a vector [formula] In this model, the probability of there being an edge between two nodes j and j' depends only on their block membership [formula] Karrer and Newman[\cite=karrer2011] extend this model to the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel, in which each node j has arbitrary expected degree [formula], where kj is the observed degree [formula] for node j. The likelihood of this model assumes that the mean number of edges νjj' between any two nodes j and j' is the product of the expected degree of nodes j and j' (θj and θj', respectively), multiplied by the expected amount of mixing ωbj,bj' between the blocks to which j and j' belong. The full likelihood of this model is:

[formula]

Equation [\ref=DegSBMlik] assumes bjj' is Poisson distributed (allowing for multiple edges between pairs of nodes), which converges to a simple Bernoulli network for sparse networks in the limit ni  →    ∞  [\cite=karrer2011]. The second half of the likelihood contains factors of one half to account for the fact that self-edges (edges from one node to itself) are counted twice by this indexing.

In addition to block structure and node degree, networks may vary in the extent to which degrees of adjacent nodes are correlated[\cite=newman2002a]. One metric for summarizing this property is degree assortativity, which is the Pearson correlation coefficient of degrees of adjacent nodes taken over all network edges[\cite=callaway2001]. Degree assortativity can be varied by performing degree assortative rewiring, which increases or decreases the assortativity in the network while preserving block structure and each node's degree[\cite=xulvi2004][\cite=rao1996]. This is performed by randomly selecting two edges within a block pair and rewiring them, as described in Algorithm 1. A diagram of this process is shown in Figure [\ref=rewire]. To decrease assortativity, the inequality in Step 3 must be reversed.

Algorithm 1: Edge Rewiring to Adjust Assortativity

Select two blocks bl and bl' at random.

Select two edges (N1,N2) and (N3,N4) at random between blocks bl and bl'.

If |kN1  -  kN2|  +  |kN3  -  kN4|  >  |kN1  -  kN4|  +  |kN2  -  kN3|:

Remove edges (N1,N2) and (N3,N4)

Add edges (N1,N4) and (N2,N3)

Infectious Process

An infectious process on the collection of networks[\cite=pastorsatorras2015] is simulated by employing a stochastic compartmental SI model[\cite=anderson1992book], shown in Algorithm 2. S% of all nodes are initially selected to be infected at random across all study networks i = 1,...,m. Then, infected node j in network cluster i selects qi;j of their ki;j neighbors and infect them with probability p0, where qi;j is the node's infectivity (described in more detail below). This process is repeated until B% of the population is infected at baseline. Half of the clusters are determined to be exposed (Ai = 1) or unexposed (Ai = 0), and the infectious process continues for T time steps with a probability to infect p0 for unexposed clusters, and p1 for exposed clusters.

Algorithm 2: Stochastic Compartmental Epidemic Process

S% of all nodes are selected uniformly at random to be initially infected.

Until B% population incidence:

For each infected node j (in random order):

Successively select qi;j neighbors.

If neighbor j' is already infected, do nothing. If not, infect with probability p0.

Repeat T times:

For each infected node j (in random order):

Successively select qi;j neighbors.

If neighbor j' is already infected, do nothing. If not, infect with probability:

p0 for those in unexposed clusters,

p1 for those in exposed clusters.

In this process, infectivity qi;j is the number of individuals node j may infect at a given time, which may vary between 0 and ki;j. Zhou et al.[\cite=zhou2006] showed that the properties of network spread can depend strongly on infectivity. Unit infectivity and degree infectivity occur when an individual attempts to infect either one partner (selected at random) or all partners, respectively. Illustrative diagrams of the infectious process over time are given in the Supplementary Section S1.

While a network i consists of pairwise connections between individuals j and j', properties of the network can be summarized for each node [formula]. This vector is composed of a small number of functions of the network to which the nodes belong, which can be used for the estimation of the effects of exposure, discussed in the following section. Some of these are constant per network, and some are different for every individual. They fall into four broad classes: those involving degree, mesoscopic structure (structure with a size between that of the node and entire network), baseline infections, and combinations of these.

Let [formula] represent the ni  ×  ni adjacency matrix for the network structure in cluster i. One network summary for each node j is its degree, [formula] Mean neighbor degree [formula] is the unweighted average of a node's neighbors' degrees. Assortativity is a composite measure of mean neighbor degree across the entire network, defined previously.

Network features may also capture mesoscopic network structure, or structure existing between local and global scales of the network. For example, two blocks of nodes (bi;j∈{1,5}) may be more highly connected to all other blocks the simulated networks. Another mesoscopic structure is a connected component, or subset of nodes for which a path exists between each pair of nodes. A path exists between two node j and j' if and only if there exists a subset of edges Ei;jj'  ⊆  Ei in the network that connect nodes j and j'. The components of the network c∈1,...,Ci are assumed to be ordered from largest to smallest. The largest component in the network contains [formula] nodes. The mean component size is ni / Ci, the number of components Ci, and the size of the component each node belongs to is [formula].

Another summary feature is the infectious status of each node in the network at baseline. One simple metric is the number of infected neighbors at baseline for each node [formula], or the number of infected individuals belonging to the same component as a given node [formula]. Another metric is the length of the shortest path between each node j and each infected individual j' at baseline. The shortest path length between nodes j and j' is di;jj', where di;jj': =   ∞   when no path exists between the two nodes. The shortest path length from the closest node infected at baseline is min j'di;jj', with inverse [formula]. The sum of the inverse path lengths to node j is [formula]. While these final metrics would be difficult to determine with limited knowledge about a network, we examine whether their inclusion in the analysis yields strong enough improvements to warrant the efforts to gather the required network data. Additional metrics may also be defined for multilayer networks, in which several edges with distinct labels may be shared between nodes[\cite=omodei2016]. The outcome model may incorporate any subset of covariates, for example as obtained from a stepwise selection procedure[\cite=jennrich1968]. Table [\ref=feature_table] summarizes these network features.

Estimation of the Effect of the Exposure

Consider an observational study that consists of i = 1,...,m clusters with j = 1,...,ni individuals per cluster, and [formula] total individuals in the study. For each individual, the outcome for individual j in cluster i (Yi;j) is 1 if the individual is infected by the end of the study, and 0 otherwise. The vector [formula] is the associated vector of outcomes in cluster i. Each individual belongs to a cluster specific contact network with corresponding adjacency matrix [formula]. We assume there is no mixing across clusters, i.e., clusters are independent. In addition, each individual has a set of P cluster-level and individual-level covariates [formula], with all covariates represented compactly as [formula]. Each cluster is either unexposed (Ai = 0), or exposed (Ai = 1). The causal parameter of interest βA is the average risk difference between outcomes, comparing exposed to unexposed clusters. This quantity is estimated in the marginal regression model [formula]. Because the true data generating mechanism is a stochastic epidemic process on a collection of networks, the true effect of an exposure is not directly specified, and can only be determined through extensive simulation[\cite=woodward2001]. The GEE-based approach, reweighted for inverse probability of exposure, gives estimates that are consistent and asymptotically normal[\cite=kurth2006], so βA is defined as the average of the A estimates over R stochastic replicates.

By adjusting for chance imbalance in exposure groups and accounting for correlation between covariates and the outcome, it is possible to improve the efficiency of estimation by incorporating baseline covariates [formula] in the approach. This consists of using an inverse probability weighted GEE, including a propensity score to estimate the probability of exposure assignment[\cite=prague2016arxiv]. Using the augmented GEE approach for observational data,[\cite=prague2016accounting] the exposure effect is the vector of coefficients [formula] that solves the following estimating equation:

[formula]

where [formula] is the design matrix. The covariance matrix [formula] is equal to [formula], where [formula] a diagonal matrix with elements var(Yi;j), φ is the dispersion parameter, and [formula] is the working correlation structure with non-diagonal terms [formula]. The ni  ×  ni matrix [formula] is the inverse probability weighting for each cluster, where [formula] is the Propensity Score (PS) of exposure assignment for cluster i. The PS is correctly specified if it equals the true exposure assignment mechanism [formula], where [formula] are nuisance parameters to be estimated. The PS is obtained by fitting a binary response model that regresses the exposure indicator Ai on cluster-level covariates and mean individual-level covariates aggregated at the cluster level [formula]. The Outcome Model (OM) [formula] is an arbitrary function of [formula] given for each intervention group, where [formula] are nuisance parameters to be estimated. The variance of [formula] is estimated by using a sandwich estimator. The estimator is most efficient if [formula]. The model for the OM can be selected with a data-driven approach (such as stepwise) without loss of consistency [\cite=stephens2012]. This approach estimates the true exposure effect without bias if the PS is correctly specified[\cite=prague2016accounting].

Simulation

Specification of Simulation Scenarios

This section specifies the network block structure and epidemic spread used in the simulation of observational studies. In anticipation of the empirical dataset to follow, each simulated study consists of an infectious process propagating on m = 48 clusters (networks) of sizes ranging from n = 120 to 280, with an average size of size 200, totaling 9600 individuals. For R = 1000 simulation replicates each, six binary aspects are varied combinatorially to create 26 scenarios, with details to follow:

Two types of block structure are considered here, both of which are special cases of bipartite networks. A bipartite network is one in which each node belongs to exactly one of two groups, and edges only exist between members of different groups. Each network in our simulation comprises eight blocks: four blocks in male and female groups, assuming a heterosexual (bipartite) contact network. Two different block structures are considered: random, and heterogeneous. For a complete description of the block structures used, see Supplementary Section S2. A diagram of these structures is shown in Figure [\ref=block].

The epidemic process is assumed to continue for T = 5 times steps. For simplicity, we assume a strong exposure effect; for exposed and unexposed clusters, the probability each infected node infects a selected neighbor is p1 = 0.1 and p0 = 0.3, respectively.

The probability that a given cluster is exposed is a simple logistic function of a single cluster level covariate, i.e., the number of infected neighbors at baseline summed for all nodes in each cluster (see Equation [\ref=exposure_equation]). For each scenario, ψ0 and ψA are selected such that this probability is between (10,90)% for all clusters. In the estimation process, the simple regression used for the exposure propensity model includes this covariate, ensuring asymptotically unbiased estimation of the exposure effect.

[formula]

For r = 1,...,R replicates, the augmented GEE estimates of exposure effect size r and estimate standard deviation r(r) are evaluated. Because the probability of cluster-level exposure is correctly specified, the estimated exposure estimate for each simulation r is unbiased. Therefore, the true exposure effect across all simulations is estimated as the average of all exposure effect estimates, [formula].

The metric for the gained improvement associated with the augmentation term is the percent reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE) for each adjustment covariate set, comparing the augmentation adjustment [formula] to that of the unadjusted GEE ([formula]):

[formula]

Simulation Results

Adjusting for covariates increases efficiency when the covariate is related to outcomes as well as the exposure. In the simulated studies, the adjustment covariates are correlated with both the outcome and exposure, with full results given in Supplementary Section S3. We therefore expect reductions in the RMSE upon employing a combination of them in the outcome model. Because the process includes a novel infection spreading of moderate duration spreading only through network ties, we predict that adjusting for each node's number of infected neighbors at baseline (covariate X(9) in Table [\ref=feature_table]) to be a significant adjustment covariate. We also investigate more data-adaptive approaches, such as including all covariates in Table [\ref=feature_table] as well as a stepwise selection procedure. Table [\ref=marginal_table] reports empirical bias, estimated and empirical variance of the exposure effect estimate, improvement in RMSE, statistical power, and coverage averaged across of the 26 observational scenarios (with standard deviations across scenarios in parentheses).

Across most all scenarios, covariate adjustment leads to significant gains in power. In addition, coverage is adequate for many scenarios, ensuring a valid interpretation of power for those scenarios. This indicates low bias, albeit moderately anti-conservative estimates of standard error. However, coverage can be low when using all covariates or a stepwise selection of them; this lower coverage can be caused by overfitting in the outcome model.

The distribution of the proportion of occasions each covariate is selected by stepwise selection (minimizing AIC) for inclusion in the outcome model is evaluated for each scenario, given in Figure [\ref=percent_included]. This figure shows that some covariates are very frequently selected for inclusion, including degree (covariate X(1)) and covariates related to infection at baseline (covariates X(9) - X(12)), whereas others are selected in a range of frequencies. The outcomes models for the two exposure groups share broad similarity.

Assumptions about the simulated infectious process affect study metric such as bias and improvement in RMSE. The size of these effects are evaluated using simple linear regression, treating each statistic as the outcome, and binary aspects of the simulation as Bernoulli covariates. The coefficients resulting from this model represent the percent improvement resulting from changing one aspect from 0 to 1, holding all other simulation aspects constant. The percent improvement in RMSE is shown in Table [\ref=improvement_modification_table]; related metrics are available in the Supplementary Section S3. To provide guidance on how to interpret coefficients, we provide an example of a description of a coefficient of improvement modification by singling out the row "Degree Infectivity" and column X(9). Holding constant average degree, degree distribution, network assortativity, community structure, and infectivity, an epidemic process exhibiting high baseline prevalence shows an additional improvement of 27 percentage points in RMSE compared to an epidemic process exhibiting unit infectivity. Therefore, using adjustment variable X(9) (total number of infected neighbors at baseline) is more important if the observation of the epidemic begins with a high baseline compared to a low baseline. This suggests that a node's local network of partners and their infectious status can be quite predictive of the risk acquire the infection, a finding that has also been reported by Ghani et al.[\cite=ghani2000]

An analysis of which features are selected in the stepwise procedure for each simulation scenario is given in Supplementary Section S4. While we have considered a range of simulation variants, the modeling assumptions may not hold in an empirical spreading process, such as the process being well-characterized by an SI process propagating on a fixed network.

Application to Empirical Data

This section describes an application of our approach to incorporating contact network information in the estimation of exposure effects in the adoption of microfinance loans in a collection of 49,707 individuals in 49 villages in Karnataka, India[\cite=banerjee2013]. The adoption of the loan program is an example of a diffusive process[\cite=katz1963]. However, because the microfinance program was novel to the region (designed to be spread by word-of-mouth through community leaders) and its impact was assessed for a fixed time, we assume the diffusion process spreads can also be described as an infectious process. Six months before their introduction, leaders from each village (14.7% of the total population) were selected to attend an informational meeting about the program, and asked to inform others about it. Sociodemographic information (such as age and sex) were gathered for some individuals (totalling 12,122) in each village, as well as which households individuals belong to. Households were also offered the opportunity to concurrently enroll in a self-help program. In addition, the networks of each village were assessed, where edges in each network are social, familial, or economic ties. The outcome for each individual is whether they belong to a household that eventually participated in the microfinance program.

For both exposures, we calculated unadjusted estimates assessing the differential uptake of microfinance by exposure. The first estimate is the crude average difference in the fraction of uptake of microfinance at the household level in the two exposure groups. The second estimate in the unaugmented GEE, which accounts for the correlation in outcomes among each village. In addition, we also developed a range of outcome models to be used as augmentation terms with the goal of reducing the estimated standard error[\cite=stephens2012]. For "Network Covariates Only," we include each of the variables mentioned in the simulation (estimates of X(1) - X(12)). For "Network & Sociodemographic," we include sex and age as well. For each strategy, β0 is the estimated uptake of microfinance in the control group, and β1 is the change associated with both exposures. Results are given in Table [\ref=exposure_table]. Full details on the outcome models used for each exposure model and adjustment strategy can be found in the Supplementary Section S5.

Table [\ref=exposure_table] shows that adjusting for the propensity of exposure alters the estimated exposure effect. For example, the estimate for the effect of Exposure 1 changes from -0.002 to -0.069, and the estimated effect for Exposure 2 from 0.018 to 0.03. These moderately large changes are indicative of confounding by network features, and adjustment for exposure propensity is required. Additionally, adjusting for both network and sociodemographic covariates for Exposure 1 substantially reduces estimated standard error, and both augmentation models conclude an exposure effect not detected by the unadjusted analysis. In contrast, the analysis of Exposure 2 does not show an effect of micro-finance on uptake.

These empirical results can be compared to the related simulation setting. If the exposure model is correctly specified, no bias is expected; the adjustment strategy consisting of both Network and Sociodemographic covariates for the exposure of a high fraction of leaders reduces estimated standard error by 46%, comparable to the corresponding simulation scenario improvement in RMSE of 26-52%. It is possible that other measures of leadership for multilayered networks[\cite=omodei2016] would show further improvements in efficiency. In contrast, the analysis of the exposure of high rates of self-help does not improve estimated standard error, and fails to show an exposure effect. In the corresponding simulation scenario, the true difference due to the observational exposure is expected to be detected with high probability (as shown by the row showing high statistical power). Therefore, not detecting an exposure effect for self-help is either due to an improbable failure to detect significance, or that self-help is in fact not associated with taking up microfinance.

Discussion

In an epidemic process, infectious outcomes depend on contact network structure and spreading process dynamics. When assessing the marginal effect of exposure on the infectious process, one strategy to improve the estimation of the exposure effect is to adjust for covariate imbalance in the clusters in each exposure group. Several contact network features and characteristics of epidemic spread can be included to adjust this analysis. In this paper, we have used the augmented GEE for observational studies to estimate the magnitude of these gains, as well as investigated how these gains are modified by network properties and epidemic dynamics. We found that adjusting for baseline infections yields robust gains across each scenario, and that the extent of improvements depends on the specific aspects of the epidemic process.

We considered including augmentation terms that reduce network properties to a single covariate for each node. These covariates differed in the gains they provide in our simulation scenarios, but also in their usefulness across epidemic scenarios, interpretability, and feasibility of gathering in practice. For example, the sum of all inverse path lengths to an infected individual showed both wide variation in RMSE improvements across each setting. It would also be difficult to assess this covariate for each person in practice unless one obtains the full network and the infectious state of each individual at baseline. In contrast, each individuals' degree may be feasible to obtain, but the gains we observed from this covariate were modest. Averaged across all scenarios, the number of neighbors infected at baseline is an excellent covariate in each of these respects.

This work invites several extensions. We assumed that each collection of networks is known with perfect accuracy, which is not realistic. Information may be missing or misreported for individual outcomes, contact network data, or both, which may lead to bias or lowered power in estimating the exposure effect. In addition, out epidemic process and exposure regime may be a restrictively simple, failing to capture realistic dynamics of an epidemic under study.

S1: Figures of the Infectious Process

Figure [\ref=network_schematic] shows a schematic of infectious process for a specific node in a given network. Figure [\ref=infectious_schematic] shows the infectious process at its onset, its development until baseline, and its progression until study end.

S2: Generation of Block Structure

In order to simulate epidemic spread, we create a collection of networks designed to mimic community structure and mixing patterns found in sexual contact networks. To accomplish this, we employ the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel [\cite=karrer2011], which allows for an arbitrary degree distribution and block structure.

We create networks that are bipartite, show community structure, and allow for members of two blocks to mix more than other block pairs. Let bi∈{1,...,B} be the block membership for node i, with B = 8 blocks total. Define the total degree for members of each block i as [formula], and the total number of edges [formula]. The Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel specifies the amount of mixing between blocks by specifying mixing matrix [formula], which details the total number of edges shared between members of pairs of blocks. This matrix requires a constraint to ensure all edges belong to some block pair: [formula], where [formula] and [formula].

Before specifying the mixing structure we chose for our paper, we introduce three consistent mixing matrix specifications, each with different properties we detail next. Edges might exist only between the two halves of the network, making it a bipartite network. In order to create consistent bipartite networks, we define the two halves as four blocks each, J1  =  {1,2,3,4} and J2  =  {5,6,7,8}. We require the total number of edges existing between the four blocks of each half of the bipartition to be equal:

[formula]

If edges only exist between pairs of blocks (κi,κj), the networks is said to comprise bipartite communities. [formula] gives the mixing matrix corresponding to edges only existing in four bipartite communities. It is also possible for only some block pairs to represent a sociodemographic group that mixes less discriminately with other blocks. For example, in the context of HIV, such blocks may stand to represent sex workers. This is accomplished by those blocks sharing edges proportional to the degree of the blocks in the other bipartite half: this is specified by [formula]. Finally, all blocks in each bipartite half may share their edges proportional to the total degree of each other block in the other bipartition half, which is detailed by [formula]. Each of these mixing matrices are detailed below.

[formula]

Finally, a range of linear combinations of these matrices may be used to specify a mixing matrix with a combination of features described above, provided these combinations sum to 1:

[formula]

To create a random bipartite comunity structure, we selected mixing matrix values (λ = 0.0,μ = 0.0). To create strong community structure, two highly-mixing blocks, and some random mixing between blocks, we selected mixing matrix values (λ = 0.1,μ = 0.8).

S3: Full Simulation Results

In this section, we show the empirical correlations between each network feature with the exposure as well as the outcome. We also give tables for the exposure effect size, bias, estimated and robust standard error, reduction in RMSE, statistical power, and statistical coverage. For r = 1,...,R trials, we compute the augmented GEE estimates of treatment effect size r and estimate standard deviation r(r). In addition, we use trial outcomes Yij;r to compute the true treatment effect by calculating the average risk difference across all trials:

[formula]

From this value, obtain the estimated empirical bias and empirical variance of the treatment effect estimate:

[formula]

To combine the amount of bias and size of the standard error in a single composite measure, we compute the root mean squared error for each trial, defined as:

[formula]

Our metric for the gained improvement by the augmentation term is the percent reduction in RMSE for each adjustment covariate set, comparing the augmentation adjustment [formula] to that of the unadjusted GEE ([formula]:

[formula]

Statistical coverage is the probability that the estimated confidence intervals cover the true treatment effect, which must be 95% or greater for valid inference:

[formula]

Finally, in our setting with the null hypothesis β  =  0, power is the probability that the confidence interval is significantly different from zero given that the treatment effect is not zero:

[formula]

We show tables for these values in three views: averaged across all scenarios; modifications associated with altering one scenario holding all others constant; values conditional on the specific scenario considered.

Empirical Correlation in Generated Studies

Figure [\ref=Correlations] gives the empirical correlation in our generated studies between the outcome and each covariate, as well as with the exposure. Nonzero covariate correlations in both panels suggests gains in efficiency when estimating the effect of exposure.

Statistics Modification By Simulation Aspect

In this subsection, we present the change in each statistical performance metric changes when changing a single simulation aspect, holding all others constant. We estimate this by performing simple linear regression, with each metric as the outcome, and indicator variables for each simulation aspect as binary covariates. These estimates differ by the covariate set used in the augmentation term. for adjustment Tables [\ref=tab:mod_summary]-[\ref=tab:mod_power] present these coefficients for exposure effect size, bias, estimated effect estimate standard error, empirical effect estimate standard error, improvement in RMSE, power, and coverage.

S4: Determinants of Stepwise Selection of Network Features

In this section, we provide an analysis of which features are selected in the stepwise procedure for each simulation scenario. The fraction of simulations in which each adjustment covariate is included depends on each simulation aspect, holding all others constant. Table [\ref=inclusion_modifications] gives linear regression coefficients evaluating this relationship. Holding all other factors constant, infectious processes in our simulation environment with a high baseline prevalence included more variables than otherwise. Some variables are almost always included (X(1), X(9), and X(11)), whereas variables selected less frequently (for example, X(4) - X(8)) depend on one or more scenarios, depending on which covariate is considered for inclusion. Finally, the relationship between simulation aspects and covariate inclusion is broadly significant when the associated effect on inclusion exceeds about 0.1, signifying that only strong changes in inclusion by simulation aspect are statistically surprising.

S5: Estimates of Application Dataset and Outcome Model

In this section, we display the distribution for the degree of all individuals in the Karnataka dataset. In addition, we provide details on the outcome models used in the Application section. Tables [\ref=tab:leaders] and [\ref=tab:selfhelp] show the covariates used in the outcome models for each adjustment strategy estimating both exposures. Finally, Tables [\ref=tab:exnet]-[\ref=tab:unexsocio] and Tables [\ref=tab:self_exnet]-[\ref=tab:self_unexsocio] Give the estimates, estimated standard deviations, and t- and p-values for statistical significance when adjusting for all other covariates.

Karnataka Degree Distribution

Figure [\ref=degree_distribution] shows While individuals with the largest degree exhibit scale-free behavior, the large majority of individuals exhibit a narrow degree distribution, indicating that a scale-free (powerlaw) degree distribution is not a good fit.
