Introduction

We consider the model of point scatterers in three dimensions, which goes back to the classical works [\cite=BP], [\cite=Fer], [\cite=Zel], [\cite=BF] and presented in detail in the book [\cite=AGHH]. For more recent results on such models, see [\cite=DFT], [\cite=BBMR], [\cite=GRN] and references therein. More precisely, we consider the stationary Schrödiger equation

[formula]

with multipoint potential (scatterer)

[formula]

consisting of n single-point scatterers vzj,αj(x), where each point scatterer vzj,αj(x) is described by its position [formula] and its internal parameter [formula], where zi  ≠  zj if i  ≠  j.

In the present article we study multipoint scatterers v for which equation ([\ref=eq:1]) admits non-zero solutions [formula] at energy E = 0, or in other words, we study the multipoint scatterers with zero-energy bound states. These studies are motivated, in particular, by studies of low-energy scattering effects in three dimensions. To our knowledge, the question about zero-energy bound states for multipoint scatterers was not considered properly in the literature. Besides, our studies were stimulated by [\cite=TT], where interesting examples of regular rapidly decaying potentials with well-localized zero energy bound states in two dimensions were constructed using the Moutard transform technique.

Results of the present article include Proposition 1, Theorem 1 and Examples 1 and 2 given below.

Solitions of the Schrödinger equation with multipoint potential

We say that ψ satisfies ([\ref=eq:1]) iff

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

In this article we use the same normalization of multipoint scatterers as in the book [\cite=AGHH], see pages 47, 112.

A function ψ  =  ψ(x) satisfies ([\ref=eq:3])-([\ref=eq:5]) if and only if this function admits the following representation:

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and [formula] satisfies the following linear system:

[formula]

where A is the n  ×  n matrix

[formula]

[formula]

Proposition 1 is a variation of statements used in the book [\cite=AGHH].

Zero-energy bound states

Equation ([\ref=eq:1]) with multipoint potential v of the form ([\ref=eq:2]) admits a non-zero solution [formula] at energy E = 0 if and only if there exists a non-zero [formula] such that

[formula]

[formula]

where A is defined by ([\ref=eq:10]). In addition, the one-to-one correspondence between such solutions ψ and vectors [formula] is given by:

[formula]

Theorem 1 follows from Proposition 1, the property that

[formula]

the linear independence of G+(|  ·   - zj|,0), [formula], the following asymptotic formula for ψ of the form ([\ref=eq:14]):

[formula]

and the following lemma:

Let ψ0 satisfy ([\ref=eq:7]) for E = 0 and:

[formula]

Then [formula].

Lemma 1 follows from the mean value property over balls for harmonic functions, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Liouville's theorem for harmonic functions.

In the next example we consider a scatterer consisting of four equal single point scatterers located in the vertices of a regular tetrahedron.

Let n = 4, [formula], |zj - zj'| = s > 0 for all j  ≠  j', 1  ≤  j,j'  ≤  4, αj  =  α =  - (4πs)- 1, and v be given by ([\ref=eq:2]). Then E = 0 is a triple eigenvalue for equation ([\ref=eq:1]) (i.e. the space of solutions of equation ([\ref=eq:1]) in [formula] for E = 0 is three-dimensional).

This statement follows directly from Theorem 1.

In the next example we consider a scatterer consisting of 2m equal single point scatterers located in the vertices of a regular planar 2m-gon.

Let n = 2m, [formula] be sequentially enumerated vertices of a convex regular planar (belonging to a fixed plane) polygon with 2m vertices,

[formula]

and v be given by ([\ref=eq:2]). Then:

[formula]

[formula]

is a zero-energy bound state for equation  ([\ref=eq:1]);

[formula]

The point is that in this example the zero-energy bound state ψ is strongly localized for large m.

On the other hand, this example holds already for m = 1 when our polygon reduces to a segment.

In addition, we have the conjecture that E = 0 is a simple eigenvalue in this example; it was checked numerically up to m = 48 using Theorem 1.

The property ([\ref=eq:17]) follows from the formulas:

[formula]

[formula]

Formulas ([\ref=eq:16]), ([\ref=eq:18]) were obtained using ([\ref=eq:12]) with qj = ( - 1)j + 1, [formula], and finding α such that ([\ref=eq:12]) holds for αj  =  α, [formula].

To prove the localization property ([\ref=eq:19]) we choose orthogonal coordinates such that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

where

[formula]

θ, φ are the polar and azimuthal angles of ν, respectively, bl are the expansion coefficients:

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

The localization ([\ref=eq:19]) follows from the property:

[formula]

In turn, identity ([\ref=eq:26]) follows from the formulas:

[formula]

[formula]

This completes the proof of Example 2.
