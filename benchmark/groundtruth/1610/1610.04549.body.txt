Random walk in degree space and the time-dependent Watts-Strogatz model

Introduction

The investigation of structure and dynamics of networks has been a powerful strategy to analyze interacting many-body problems present in many different areas: biological, ecological, economical and social systems, to name some of them. The map of these systems into graphs is a fruitful old idea, and the knowledge of the interconnection between its vertices is a necessary condition that allows us to examine a myriad of pratical problems [\cite=AB02] [\cite=DM03] [\cite=N03] [\cite=BLMCH06] [\cite=NB06] [\cite=N10].

Nowadays, there are several research interests involving complex networks. We can say, for instance, that there is an effort to obtain a better understanding of networks from some of its internal structures like the formation of communities [\cite=GN02] [\cite=NG04], or a more complex interconnection of graphs like the multilayer networks [\cite=BBCdGGGRSNWZ14] [\cite=KABGMP14]. The complexity of the internal structure reflects on the entropy of the network [\cite=B08] [\cite=AB09], which shows the possibility of classifying several internal structures. At the same time, we still have progress on important questions that use complex networks as a framework to define other problems on it; for instance, we can cite the active area of epidemiological models [\cite=PSCVMV15], or statistical models on complex networks to analyze critical phenomena [\cite=DGM08].

At this point, it is worth mentioning that despite the progress in several directions, it is natural that analytical results are less frequent than numerical ones, which is understandable due to the technical complexities presented by many relevant questions. Furthermore, many existing analytical results come from stationary regime. In this scenario, we propose a scheme that estimates the time-dependent degree distribution. In order to illustrate our idea, we revisited the Watts-Strogatz model [\cite=WS98]. Although not being a complex network in the sense that it does not display a heterogeneous degree distribution [\cite=BA99], it has small-world property and has high clustering [\cite=WS98] [\cite=BW00], two properties shared with many real networks. The model was originally defined as an intermediate configuration between a regular lattice and a graph where all their nodes are randomly linked, and we will present a slightly modified version from the original one in order to capture its dynamical evolution analytically.

The layout of this work is as follows. In purpose of illustrating the main idea of the work, we start with a dynamical version of the Erdös-Rényi model [\cite=ER59] [\cite=G59] in section 2 and we introduce the main model, the time-dependent Watts-Strogatz graph, in section 3. Then, we present the main idea that allow one to achieve an analytical form for the dynamic degree distribution in section 4. Some final comments are presented in section 5.

Time-dependent Erdös-Rényi model

The initial condition of the model consists of N vertices and no edges at time t = 0. At each time step, two vertices are randomly chosen and linked; this includes the possibility of having a loop (an edge that connects a vertex to itself). It is clear that each end of an edge links to a vertex with probability 1 / N. Therefore, defining p(k,s,t) as the probability that a vertex s has degree k at time t, one can represent the dynamics as

[formula]

with p(k,s,t = 0) = δk,0 as the initial condition, where δk,m is the Kronecker symbol (δk,m = 1 when k = m, and δk,m = 0 otherwise). Furthermore, [formula] is the time-independent conditional probability of changing the degree of a vertex from m to k; in the present case,

[formula]

By introducing the time-dependent degree distribution,

[formula]

the time evolution equation ([\ref=er_me]) can be written as

[formula]

If now one introduces the Z-transform

[formula]

it is straightforward that

[formula]

where the initial condition is Φ(K,0) = 1 and

[formula]

From ([\ref=L_er]), one sees that the right-hand side of ([\ref=PhiPhi0]) is a polynomial in K, and the time-dependent degree distribution P(k,t) is the coefficient of the term of order Kk (which we will refer as Kk-term) in the right hand side of ([\ref=PhiPhi0]). Hence, since [formula], one can show by a direct calculation that

[formula]

This result will be revisited in section [\ref=rw], where we will treat the problem of finding the time-dependent degree distribution as a random walk in degree space.

When [formula], which is the time equivalent to the number of possible distinct edges, one recovers the Poisson distribution from the usual Erdös-Rényi model for N  ≫  1,

[formula]

The exact form of the time-dependent degree distribution can be used to investigate the Shannon entropy,

[formula]

The profile of the entropy can be investigated numerically and is presented in figure 1. It starts from a low value and achieves the maximum for t  ≈  N2 / 2, which is when the original (static) Erdös-Rényi model realizes, and the inclusion of more connections decreases the entropy, as one can see from ([\ref=Poisson]). This phenomenon can be heuristically understood by realizing that the inclusion of edges randomly (with uniform probability to each possible pair of nodes) leads the distribution to converge to a Kronecker delta, i.e., the vertices tend to have all the same degree (that increases with time) from the statistical standpoint.

Time-dependent Watts-Strogatz model

The Watts-Strogatz model [\cite=WS98] is a small-world network that, unlike the Erdös-Rényi graph, keeps high clustering. The analytical approach treats it as a static model, despite the fact that it is obtained as an intermediate configuration in rewiring process between a regular lattice and a random graph. We will define a dynamical model that generates a small-world network similar to the one introduced by Watts and Strogatz. Although being slightly different from the original Watts-Strogatz model, it is statistically equivalent and suitable for analytical investigations.

The initial condition of our model consists of a ring with N vertices, and each vertex has degree k0 by having a single link to its k0 / 2 next-neighbors as in Watts-Strogatz model. The model has, therefore, k0N / 2 edges with total degree M = k0N. The dynamics obeys the following scheme:

(i) An edge end is chosen with uniform probability [formula].

(ii) This extremity is reconnected with probability p (and kept without reconnection with probability 1 - p).

(iii) Back to (i) (repetition for a fixed number of iterations).

Therefore, the probability p(k,s,t) of a vertex s having degree k at time t obeys the discrete time recurrent equation

[formula]

where w(k|m) stands for the discrete-time transition rate (conditional probability) from the state of degree m to degree k, as in the previous section. Furthermore, the initial condition is p(k,s,t = 0) = δk,k0

Consider now a vertex s at time t; it can have degree k at time t + 1 in the following scenarios:

I) The vertex s has degree k - 1 at time t and degree k at time t + 1: an edge-end, which is not connected to s, is chosen with probability [formula]. Then, it rewires with probability p, and links to s with probability [formula]; therefore, one has

[formula]

II) The vertex s has degree k + 1 at time t and degree k at time t + 1: an edge-end connected to s is chosen with probability [formula]. Then, it rewires with probability p, and links to another vertex, say [formula], with probability [formula]; therefore, one has

[formula]

III) The vertex s has degree k at time t and remains with degree k at time t + 1: this scenario is divided in four cases, as follows.

IIIa) An edge-end connected to s is chosen with probability [formula], rewires with probability p, and links again to s with probability [formula];

IIIb) An edge-end connected to s is chosen with probability [formula], but does not rewire (this happens with probability 1 - p);

IIIc) An edge-end not connected to s is chosen with probability [formula], rewires with probability p, and links to a vertex that is not s with probability [formula];

IIId) An edge-end not connected to s is chosen with probability [formula], but does not rewire (this happens with probability 1 - p);

The conditional probability associated to the union of disjoint events IIIa to IIId is

[formula]

The dynamics defined above can generate a graph similar to the Watts-Strogatz model. For t = M, one has a interval of p where the system displays high clustering and low mean shortest path length, as shown in figure 2.

Figure 2: Clustering C(p) and shortest path length [formula] (normalized by C(0) and [formula], respectively) of the graph generated by the dynamics of section [\ref=tdws]. The parameters are N = 1000, k0 = 10 and t = M = k0N with 100 realizations of the simulations; the error bars are smaller than the size of the points.

The time-dependent degree distribution can be evaluated iteratively from the recurrent equation ([\ref=me]) and ([\ref=Pkt]), and this allows one to compute the entropy [formula] of the model, which is shown in figure 3.

Figure 3: Entropy of the time-dependent Watts-Strogatz model for N = 100, k0 = 6 and p = 0.01.

The entropy starts from a low value, as expected since the initial condition of Watts-Strogatz model is a regular lattice with P(k,0) = δk0. The entropy, then, grows with time, but reaches a constant value: differently from the Erdös-Rényi model, the Watts-Strogatz graph has no new connection being added, and the system converges to a stationary degree distribution different from a Kronecker-delta-like as in the Erdös-Rényi case.

Introducing, again, the Z-transform ([\ref=Z]) to the recurrent equation of the time-dependent degree distribution obtained by combining ([\ref=me]) and ([\ref=Pkt]), one has

[formula]

where the initial condition Φ(K,0) = Kk0 stands for each vertex having exactly k0 connections. The explicit form of the operator L, which acts on this polynomial, will be presented in the next section. For now, it is sufficient to state that the analytical form of the time-dependent degree distribution is not well explored in the literature.

Random walk in degree space

This section is devoted to develop the arguments that will establish analytic results concerning the time-dependent degree distribution of the two models above. The Erdös-Rényi case will support and illustrate our arguments, since its a simpler laboratory and the exact form ([\ref=Pkt_er]) is already known.

Time-dependent Erdös-Rényi model

As seen in section [\ref=tder], the time-dependent degree distribution P(k,t) is the coefficient of the Kk-term in Φ(K,t), as one can see from ([\ref=Z]). Moreover, from ([\ref=PhiPhi0]) and Φ(K,0) = K0 = 1, we have [formula]. This means that one should search for the Kk-term of a polynomial resulted from the application of [formula] for t times on K0. The operator [formula], however, can be divided into a sum of three operators, [formula], [formula] and [formula]. This separation is convenient, since when these operators are applied on a monomial Km ([formula]), one has the following behavior:

[formula]

Hence, starting from degree 0, one can see the procedure of applying t times the operator [formula] as follows. Since

[formula]

the Kk-term is a sum of many terms, each of them a product of [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Let us consider k = t = 2 as an example; in this case, the K2-term of Φ(K,2) is

[formula]

and this is P(k = 2,t = 2)K2. In the first term, the system remains with degree zero at time t = 1 and increases two unities at t = 2; similar interpretation can be made for the second and third terms. The time-dependent degree distribution is, therefore, a sum of all trajectories, which are random walks in degree space (see figure 4), that leads k = 0 at t = 0 to degree k at time t. At each time step, the degree can increase one unity, or two unities, or stay constant with probabilities β, γ and α, respectively (note that α  +  β  +  γ = 1 and α,β,γ > 0). Hence, denoting by ym the degree at time m, it is straightforward that

[formula]

where ym  ≥  0 for 0  ≤  m  ≤  t and the first two Kronecker deltas refer to the initial and final conditions; each term inside the parenthesis indicates if the degree at time m remains constant or increases (with one or two unities) when compared to the degree at the previous instant, ym - 1.

Figure 4: Three examples of possible evolution of the degree (these examples do not apply for the Erdös-Rényi model, where the degree never decreses). The initial and final degrees should be k0 and k, respectively.

The continuous version of ([\ref=ER_rw]) is a path-integral formulation of the problem. Nevertheless, it does not lead to an expression that can be trivially tackled by the usual methods.

The time-dependent degree distribution can be evaluated explicitely by exploring the property that [formula], [formula] and [formula] are c-numbers. During the time interval t, there should be n1, n2 and n3 terms of α, β and γ, respectively, such that n1 + n2 + n3 = t and n2 + 2n3 = k. Therefore,

[formula]

which yields the same result of ([\ref=Pkt_er]), as expected. In ([\ref=ER_step]), [formula] is the largest integer equal or less than x, and the last equality can be shown after a lengthy induction argument.

Finally, one can also restate the recurrent equation [formula] as [formula], where now we have two types of operators,

[formula]

that act for an interval of time equal to 2t on the initial condition.

Time-dependent Watts-Strogatz model

Similarly as in the previous case, the time-dependent Watts-Strogatz degree distribution is the Kk-term of Φ(K,t) = LtΦ(K,0), where now the initial condition is Φ(K,0) = Kk0 and

[formula]

with

[formula]

The form of these operators, which are not c-numbers anymore, can be deduced by ([\ref=w(k|k-1)]), ([\ref=w(k|k+1)]), ([\ref=w(k|k)]) and the Z-transform of ([\ref=me]). When these operators are applied on a polynomial of degree m, one has

[formula]

with

[formula]

Note that now the coefficients am, bm and dm are not constants and the operators L1, L0 and L- 1 do not commute as in Erdös-Rényi case. Following the same argument that has led to ([\ref=ER_rw]), we have

[formula]

for the Watts-Strogatz model. The degree starts with y0 = k0 at time t = 0 and ends with yt = k at time t. Between these boundaries, the variable ym performs a random walk. This expression is not analytically treatable, and we will invoke some simplifications, which consist of choosing the dominant contributions (paths) to P(k,t).

Monotonic paths

In this section, we will concentrate on the dominant contributions to the degree distribution P(k,t). This follows by choosing a class of paths that starts at y0 = k0 and ends at yt = k. By noticing that am  =  O(1)  ≫  bm,dm, the dominant contributions come from terms that maximize the number of am-factors. This implies minimizing the number of bm-factors or dm-factors such that they should appear only to change the degree from k0 to k. In other terms, we have k - k0 terms of bm (dm) type if k  ≥  k0 (k < k0), and the remaining [formula] terms are of am type. Note that these are monotonic paths in the sense that the degree only increases (if k  ≥  k0) or decreases (if k < k0).

Let us consider initially, the case Δ: = k - k0  ≥  0. Writing the sum of all monotonic paths as being equal to the time-dependent degree distribution leads to

[formula]

The bm terms are functions of the degree ym (see equation ([\ref=bad])), and not on the instant they appear. In the monotonic crescent path, therefore, each term, [formula] should appear one and only one time in this order. The remaining t - Δ segments of the path are filled by am-terms, and there should be n0 of them that are ak0, n1 of them that are ak0 + 1, and so on (see figure 5). Firstly it is immediate from ([\ref=bad]) that

[formula]

Figure 5: Increasing monotonic paths. All the monotonic paths, when k  ≥  k0, are located inside the envelope defined by the dashed lines. The upper dashed line corresponds to the path [formula], and the lower dashed line is the monotonic path [formula].

On the other hand, by using [formula] one has where we have performed the change of variables u0 = t - Δ - n0, u1 = u0 - n1, u2 = u1 - n2 up to uΔ - 1 = uΔ - 2 - nΔ - 1 in the last passage. Therefore, one has

[formula]

and by ([\ref=bbb>]) and ([\ref=aaa>2]) one finally finds

[formula]

The monotonic paths when k < k0 is such that

[formula]

since now the dm-terms are needed to decrease the degree. Since

[formula]

by following a similar procedure as before, one has

[formula]

for Δ: = k - k0 < 0.

The comparison between the (exact) numerical time-dependent degree distribution obtained from the recurrent equation and the estimations ([\ref=Pkt>]) and ([\ref=Pkt<]) are shown in figure 6.

The formulas ([\ref=Pkt>]) and ([\ref=Pkt<]) should be asymptotically exact for t  ≪  M and t≃M. The reason for this statement comes from a simple analysis of the order of magnitude of the paths. Remembering that am  =  O(1), bm  =  O(pN- 1) and dm  =  O(pN- 1), a monotonic path is [formula], while there are [formula] of them. The first correction is due terms that have a bm and dm terms more than the monotonic paths terms (and two am terms less). Each one of its first correction terms are [formula], and there are [formula] of them. The contribution of the first correction is roughly O(t2p2N- 2) times the contribution of the monotonic paths. This argument can be extended to corrections of all orders. Therefore, for p  ≪  1, one expects that the formulas from the monotonic paths only are asymptotically exact for t  ≪  M and t≃M. Naturally, the same argument concludes that our estiamtions fail in the case t  ≫  M.

The numerical solution in figure 6 shows that our estimations apply in the case [formula], while the same comment can not be made for t  ≫  M, as expected.

Conclusion

In this work, we have formulated the Erdös-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz graphs as a dynamic model and characterized their behavior from the standpoint of their entropies. We have also examined their time-dependent degree distribution analytically. The Erdös-Rényi model is analytically accessible, while the same does not extend to the Watts-Strogatz model. We have, nevertheless, obtained a formula that is asymptotically exact for [formula] and confirmed this validity numerically. The main ideia to achieve this result was to consider the evolution of the degree distribution as a random walk in degree space and select the paths that have dominant contribution. We have also presented the argument that support the range of validity of our formula, which is based on the estimation of the order of magnitude of contribution of relevant terms.
