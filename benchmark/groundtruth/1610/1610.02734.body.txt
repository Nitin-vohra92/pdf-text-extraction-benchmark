Non-trivial wandering domains for heterodimensional cycles

Introduction

In this paper we study the existence of non-trivial wandering domains in nonhyperbolic dynamics. Here a non-trivial wandering domain for a given map f on a Riemannian manifold M means a non-empty connected open set D  ⊂  M which satisfies the following conditions:

[formula] for every i,j  ≥  0 with i  ≠  j;

the union of the ω-limit sets of points in D for f, denoted by ω(D,f), is not equal to a single periodic orbit.

See [\cite=dMvS93] for the original definition in the one-dimensional case. A wandering domain D is called contracting if the diameter of fn(D) converges to zero as n  →    ∞  . In the early 20th century, Bohl [\cite=Bo16] and Denjoy [\cite=D32] constructed examples of C1 diffeomorphisms on a circle which have contracting wandering domains in which the union of the ω-limit sets of points is a Cantor set. Following these results, similar phenomena were observed for high dimensional examples, see [\cite=Kn81] [\cite=Ha89] [\cite=Mc93] [\cite=BGLT94] [\cite=NS96] [\cite=KM10]. On the other hand, the absence of wandering domains is the key of classification of one-dimensional unimodal as well as one-dimensional multimodal maps, in real analytic category, which were developed in [\cite=dMvS89] [\cite=Ly89] [\cite=BlLy89] [\cite=dMvS93] [\cite=vSV04], see the survey of van Strien [\cite=vS10]. Moreover, Berry and Mestel [\cite=BM91] showed that any C1 Lorenz map without gaps does not admit a wandering domain, but the corresponding assertion for the contracting case with gaps has not been shown yet, see [\cite=GC12].

Topics about the existence of non-trivial wandering domains in nonhyperbolic dynamics were first studied by Colli-Vargas [\cite=CV01] for some two-dimensional example which is made up of an affine thick horseshoe with C2-persistent homoclinic tangencies. Moreover, their conjecture was recently proved to be true by the first and third authors [\cite=KS-ax]: any two-dimensional diffeomorphism in any Newhouse open set is contained in the Cr (2  ≤  r <   ∞  ) closure of diffeomorphisms having contracting non-trivial wandering domains for which the union of the ω-limit sets of points contains a non-trivial basic set. This result moreover implies an answer in the Cr category to one of the open problems of van Strien [\cite=vS10] which is concerned with the existence of wandering domains for the Hénon family, see [\cite=KS-ax].

There is another well-studied nonhyperbolic phenomenon different from a homoclinic tangency, which is called a heterodimensional cycle. We say that a diffeomorphism has a heterodimensional cycle associated with saddle periodic points P and Q if

[formula]

where [formula] is the dimension of the unstable bundle, called the unstable index, for a corresponding periodic point. Thus a natural question is the following:

Let f be a diffeomorphism having a heterodimensional cycle. Is the diffeomorphism f contained in the Cr closure of diffeomorphisms having contracting non-trivial wandering domains?

The next theorem is one of the main results in the present paper, which gives Corollary [\ref=co1] as an affirmative answer to this question.

Let f be a diffeomorphism on a three-dimensional manifold which has a heterodimensional cycle associated with two saddle periodic points at which both the derivatives for f have non-real eigenvalues. Then there exists a diffeomorphism g arbitrarily C1-close to f which has a contracting non-trivial wandering domain D with ω(D,g) a Cantor set.

Note that we do not necessarily assume that the cycle in Theorem [\ref=thm1] has (homoclinic/heterodimensional) tangencies. In fact, our proof is totally different from that in [\cite=CV01] [\cite=KS-ax], and hence the result is by no means an analogical extension of the case of homoclinic tangencies.

The key idea and outline of the paper

We denote by [formula] the set of all C1 diffeomorphisms which satisfy the assumption of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. That is, any element of [formula] has a heterodimensional cycle associated with two saddle periodic points at which both the derivatives for f have non-real eigenvalues. Note that [formula] is a nonempty open set. In fact, it follows from [\cite=BDK12] that for any [formula] with a heterodimensional cycle associated with saddle periodic points P and Q can be C1-stabilized. That is, every C1-neighborhood of the f contains a diffeomorphism g with two basic sets which have the continuations of P and Q, respectively, and such that g has a robust heterodimensional cycle associated with these basic sets. We furthermore denote by [formula] the set of all C1 diffeomorphisms which satisfy the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. That is, any element of [formula] has a contracting non-trivial wandering domain. Then, Theorem [\ref=thm1] can be rephrased as follows:

[formula] is contained in the C1 closure of [formula].

To show Theorem [\ref=thm1], we have to prepare auxiliary classes [formula], [formula], [formula] of diffeomorphisms on M satisfying the following inclusion relations:

[formula]

where [formula] represents the C1 closure of the corresponding set. We will give the definition of each class in the following sections. So, we here briefly explain what role each class plays in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

In Section [\ref=sec2], we first show that any element of [formula] leads to a heterodimensional cycle containing "intrinsic tangencies" which are contained in some transverse heterodimensional intersections of the cycle, see Lemma [\ref=lem:p5c]. The intrinsic tangencies yield the class [formula], for which each of elements has a "non-transverse equidimensional cycle", see Proposition [\ref=prop2.1].

In Section [\ref=sec3], we next show that [formula] is contained in the C1 closure of the class [formula], where every element has "generalized" homoclinic tangencies presented by Tatjer [\cite=Tj01], see Proposition [\ref=thm3.1]. As a matter of fact, a couple of Propositions [\ref=prop2.1] and [\ref=thm3.1] is the key of this paper which directly gives another main result:

Every element of [formula] can be C1-approximated by C2 diffeomorphisms satisfying the Tatjer condition.

Here the Tatjer condition consists of some topological requirements for the tangency given in ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) in Section [\ref=sec3]. This condition ensures several important properties presented in [\cite=Tj01]. Indeed, by virtue of one of them, we can find the class [formula] of C5 diffeomorphisms which have attracting invariant circles created by a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation.

In Section [\ref=sec4], we finally perform the Denjoy-like construction for a normal tubular neighborhood of the attracting invariant circle of any diffeomorphism in [formula] to detect non-trivial wandering domains.

Intrinsic tangencies of cycles

Let M be a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We say that submanifolds N1 and N2 of M have a transverse intersection, if there is a nonempty point [formula] such that TxM = TxN1  +  TxN2. Denote by [formula] the set of transverse intersections of N1 and N2. In this section we consider the set [formula] of all C2 diffeomorphisms on M for which any element has a non-transverse equidimensional cycle, that is, for any [formula], there are saddle periodic points P and [formula] for f satisfying the following conditions:

[formula], and the unstable eigenvalues of P are non-real, while the unstable eigenvalues of [formula] are real;

P and [formula] are homoclinically related to each other, i.e., [formula] and [formula];

there is a quadratic tangency between [formula] and Wu(P).

The main result of this section is the following proposition.

[formula] is contained in the C1 closure of [formula].

To show it, we first recall the next key result presented by Bonatti-Díaz. A co-index 1 cycle means a heterodimensional cycle with saddle periodic points P and Q whose indices satisfy the co-index 1 condition, i.e. [formula].

Let f be a diffeomorphism having a co-index 1 cycle associated with saddles P and Q. Then every C1 neighborhood of f contains a diffeomorphism g with a co-index 1 cycle having real central eigenvalues. Moreover, this cycle for g can be taken associated with saddles [formula] and [formula] which are homoclinically related to the continuations Pg of P and Qg of Q, respectively.

Here we say that the co-index 1 of g has real central eigenvalues if there is only one pair of central eigenvalues: there are a contracting real eigenvalue λ of [formula] and an expanding real eigenvalue β of [formula] such that λ and β have multiplicity 1, |λ|  >  |σ| for every contracting eigenvalue σ of [formula], and |β|  <  |η| for every expanding eigenvalue η of [formula].

The co-index 1 cycle for g in Lemma [\ref=lem2.2] is simple in the sense of [\cite=BD08] and hence the cycle contains a transverse intersection associated with the saddles [formula] and [formula], see [\cite=BD08].

Next we introduce the notion of intrinsic tangencies. Let f be a diffeomorphism on a three-dimensional manifold M having saddle periodic points P and Q with [formula]. Suppose that all eigenvalues of the derivative [formula] are real. We say that Wu(P) and Ws(Q) have an intrinsic tangency if there is a leaf [formula] of the C1 strong stable foliation Fss(Q) in Ws(Q) such that [formula] and Wu(P) have a tangency. Note that the intrinsic tangency is not necessarily contained in heterodimensional tangencies between Wu(P) and Ws(Q). In fact, it is not difficult to give examples where intrinsic tangencies are contained in [formula] (e.g., circular transverse heterodimensional intersections in [\cite=DR92] or [\cite=KS12] contain at least two such intrinsic tangencies).

Let f be any element of [formula] which has a heterodimensional cycle associated with saddle periodic points P and Q at which both the derivatives have non-real eigenvalues. One may suppose that [formula], [formula] and [formula] contains a quasi-transverse intersection. In dimension three, these saddles trivially satisfy the co-index 1 condition. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=lem2.2] and Remark [\ref=rmk2.3], one obtains a C1 diffeomorphism f1 arbitrarily C1-close to f which satisfies the following properties:

f1 has saddle periodic points [formula] and [formula] with the following conditions:

the eigenvalues of the derivatives of f1 at [formula] and [formula] are distinct real numbers;

[formula] is homoclinically related to the continuation Pf1 of P, while [formula] is homoclinically related to the continuation Qf1 of Q ;

[formula] contains a transverse intersection;

f1 has a heterodimensional cycle associated with [formula] and [formula], i.e.,

[formula] contains a transverse intersection;

[formula] contains a quasi-transverse intersection [formula].

See Figure [\ref=fg1]. Under this situation, we first show that

Wu(Pf1) and [formula] have an intrinsic tangency Z0.

We here recall that f has the saddle periodic point Q such that [formula] has a pair of non-real contracting eigenvalues. Hence, there exist a small neighborhood V of Qf1, a local chart (x,y,z) in V and real constants [formula] with 0 < |as| < 1  <  |au| such that

[formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the closure of V and Of1(  ·  ) is the orbit of the corresponding point for f1;

Qf1 = (0,0,0) and

[formula]

for any (x,y,z)∈V. Moreover, after a small local perturbation if necessary, we may assume that the above ϑ is irrational.

On the one hand, by ([\ref=1f1])-(iii), there exist an unstable disk

[formula]

and a positive integer n0 such that the transverse intersection set [formula] contains an arc [formula]. On the other hand, by ([\ref=1f1])-(ii) and the Inclination Lemma, for any ε > 0, there exist an integer m0  ≥  0 and a stable disk [formula] containing a point of [formula] and such that, for any integer m  ≥  0,

[formula]

where dC1(  ·  ,  ·  ) is the C1 distance between corresponding submanifolds, and Dsm is a component of [formula].

Note that, by Remark [\ref=rmk2.3] together with ([\ref=1f1])-(i), one has the strong stable foliation [formula] of [formula] whose leaves are of codimension one in [formula]. Hence, due to ([\ref=eq:p4curve3]) with [formula], there are an integer m1  ≥  0 and an arc [formula] such that

[formula] where [formula] for the canonical projection [formula] with πs(x,y,z) = (x,y,0);

there is a point [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the angle between the corresponding subspaces in [formula].

Therefore, one can obtain a tangency Z1 near [formula] between fn01(Du) and [formula], if necessary perturbing fn01 slightly in a neighborhood of some point of Du. Then we have the tangency

[formula]

between Wu(Pf1) and [formula]. This concludes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:p5c].

Note that, from in ([\ref=2f1])-(ii), [formula] contains the quasi-transverse intersection [formula]. Let [formula] be a point in [formula], and hence [formula] since [formula]. Consider a small segment [formula] with [formula] and [formula]. Observe that if necessary perturbing f1 slightly in a small neighborhood of Ls, we may assume that the backward image f- m1(Ls) contains a segment which is sufficiently C1-close to [formula] if m is so large. See Figure [\ref=fg1]-(a).

From the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:p5c], we have an intrinsic tangency Z0 between Wu(Pf1) and a segment [formula] in a leaf of [formula]. Note that [formula] is almost parallel to [formula] in the linearizing coordinates in a neighborhood of [formula]. Note that f1 is arbitrarily C1-approximated by a C2 diffeomorphism 1 without breaking the quasi-transverse intersection X0'. Hence, by [\cite=KNS10], there is a C2 diffeomorphism g obtained from 1 by an arbitrarily small C2 perturbation in a neighborhood of [formula] such that g- m(Ls) and [formula] have a quadratic tangency. See Figure [\ref=fg2]-(b). That is, g satisfies the condition ([\ref=B3]).

Note that it follows from ([\ref=1f1])-(ii) that ([\ref=B2]) holds for g. In addition, since the amount of all perturbations can be taken arbitrarily small, ([\ref=B1]) holds for g. In conclusion, g is contained in [formula]. This ends the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop2.1].

Denote by [formula] the set of all C1 diffeomorphisms on M which have heterodimensional cycles containing intrinsic tangencies. The next result is not required actually to show Theorem [\ref=thm1], but it is important to characterize diffeomorphisms in a neighborhood of [formula].

[formula] is contained in the C1 closure of [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=prop2.1], any element of [formula] is arbitrarily C1 approximated by a C1 diffeomorphism f1 satisfying ([\ref=1f1])-(ii). Hence from the Inclination Lemma, [formula] contains two-dimensional disks for which the forward images C1 converge to [formula]. So, this implies that [formula] and [formula] have an intrinsic tangency. On the other hand, a quasi-transverse intersection in [formula] are given in ([\ref=2f1])-(ii).

Homoclinic tangencies with the Tatjer condition

We first recall diffeomorphisms with homoclinic tangencies satisfying some conditions presented by Tatjer [\cite=Tj01], which play an important role in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. The purpose of this section is to show in Proposition [\ref=thm3.1] that diffeomorphisms with the Tatjer condition are not special in a neighborhood of [formula].

Consider a C2 diffeomorphism f on a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold M which has a homoclinic tangency of a saddle periodic point [formula] at which the derivative of f has real eigenvalues λ1,λ2 and λ3 satisfying |λ1| < 1 < |λ2| < |λ3|. Assume that there are C1 linearizing coordinates (x,y,z) for f on a neighborhood [formula] of [formula] such that

[formula]

for any (x,y,z)∈U. In [formula], the local unstable and stable manifolds of [formula] are given respectively as

[formula]

for some δ > 0. Moreover one has the local strong unstable C1 foliation [formula] in [formula] such that, for any point [formula], the leaf [formula] of [formula] containing [formula] is given as

[formula]

For any point [formula], the s-fiber Φs() at [formula] is defined as the tangent space generated by the vectors [formula], [formula]. Furthermore, if a point [formula] satisfies [formula] for some integer n > 0, we define

[formula]

which is called the s-fiber at [formula].

We say that a homoclinic tangency satisfies the Tatjer condition (which corresponds to the type I of case B in [\cite=Tj01]) if the following ([\ref=C1])-([\ref=C3]) hold.

[formula] and [formula] have a quadratic tangency at [formula] which does not belong to the strong unstable manifold [formula] of [formula];

[formula] is tangent to the leaf [formula] of [formula] at [formula];

Let [formula] be a point in [formula] with [formula] for some n0 > 0. The s-fiber [formula] at [formula] and [formula] intersect transversely.

Denote by [formula] the set of all C2 diffeomorphisms on M which have homoclinic tangencies satisfy the Tatjer condition. This set [formula] is contained in the class of diffeomorphisms having "generalized homoclinic tangencies" defined in [\cite=Tj01].

We here claim that such a tangency is not so rare in our context. Let [formula] and [formula] be submanifolds of M. For an intersection [formula], define

[formula]

which is called the codimension at the intersection [formula] associated with [formula] and [formula]. See [\cite=BR-ax]. The condition ([\ref=C3]) implies that, if one regards [formula] and [formula] as submanifolds of M, the codimension at [formula] is zero. However, ([\ref=C1]) and ([\ref=C2]) require pairs of submanifolds of codimension one as well as two:

[formula]

Thus, the homoclinic tangency with the Tatjer condition seems to be very special, as mentioned in [\cite=Tj01]. However, it can be realized by C1-small perturbations of any elements of [formula]. That is,

[formula] is contained in the C1 closure of [formula].

Let us consider [formula] having saddle periodic points Pf and [formula] and satisfying ([\ref=B1])-([\ref=B3]). Then, owing to ([\ref=B1]), by a C2 perturbation of f in a small neighborhood of Pf without breaking ([\ref=B1])-([\ref=B3]), we may as well assume from the beginning that there exist a local chart (x̄,,) in a small neighborhood U of Pf and real constants bs,bu,ϑ such that

0 < |bs| < 1 < |bu| and ϑ∈[0,1] which is an irrational number;

Pf = (0,0,0) and for any (x̄,,)∈U,

[formula]

Let 0 = (0,0,0) be a point in [formula] given by ([\ref=B2]) as shown in Figure [\ref=fg3]-(a). Without loss of generality we may suppose that [formula]. Define

[formula]

for any integer n > 0, see Figure [\ref=fg3]-(b). By the Inclination Lemma, for a large n, there is a two-dimensional disk [formula] containing 0 such that [formula] converges to [formula] in the C2 topology as n  →    ∞  . Write

[formula]

for each n > 0. Note that there is a segment [formula] contained in the the leaf through 0 of the strong unstable foliation [formula], which is carried to un by [formula]. For each n > 0, define

[formula]

See Figure [\ref=fg3]-(b).

Step 1: Let [formula] be a unit vector tangent to uun at n. Since the sequence {n} converges to Pf in M as n  →    ∞  , we have a subsequence [formula] of [formula] converging to a unit vector [formula] as ni  →    ∞   in the tangent vector space TM. This implies that, for any ε > 0, there is an integer n0: = ni0 > 0 such that

[formula]

This finishes the first step. [formula]

Next, we consider a quadratic tangency 0 between [formula] and [formula] which is given by the condition ([\ref=B3]). For every integer m  ≥  0, we write

[formula]

See Figure [\ref=fg3]-(b).

Step 2: Let Ls- m be a subarc of [formula] passing through - m for any integer m  ≥  0. Consider a unit vector [formula] tangent to Ls- m at - m. Since |bu| < 1 in ([\ref=eq3.1.1]), {- m} converges to Pf in M as m  →    ∞  . Since moreover ϑ is irrational, there exists a subsequence {mi} of {m} such that [formula] converges to [formula] in TM. This implies that, for any ε > 0, there is an integer m0 = mi0 > 0 such that

[formula]

This ends the second step. [formula]

In the next final step, we combine the above two steps.

Step 3: From ([\ref=eq3.1.2]) and ([\ref=eq3.1.3]), we have

[formula]

See Figure [\ref=fg4]-(a). This concludes the third step. [formula]

Now we add a small perturbation to f on a neighborhood of 0 to obtain a C2 diffeomorphism f1 which is C2 close to f and such that the continuation Ls- m0(f1) is obtained from Ls- m0 by a "shifting down" operation along the [formula]-axis and has a quadratic tangency 0 with un0. See Figure [\ref=fg4]-(b). Let uun0 be a curve in un0 passing through 0 and such that [formula] is contained in one of leaves of Fuu(Pf1'). In general, T0Ls- m0(f1) does not coincide with T0uun0. However, the condition ([\ref=eq3.1.4]) implies that these spaces are sufficiently close to each other. Hence, by adding a perturbation again to f1 on the neighborhood of 0, we obtain a C2 diffeomorphism f2 which is C2 close to f1 and such that the continuation Ls- m0(f2) of Ls- m0(f1) has a quadratic tangency with un0 at 0 and satisfies

[formula]

see Figure [\ref=fg4]-(c). More precisely, Ls- m0(f2) is obtained from Ls- m0(f1) by a small rotation around the axis meeting un0 orthogonally at 0.

At last we have obtained the C2 diffeomorphism g: = f2 which is C1-near f and such that

[formula] and uni0 have a quadratic tangency at 0;

moreover, at the point 0, [formula] and uun0 have a tangency with

[formula]

This implies the condition ([\ref=C2]). Note that, since [formula], the quadratic tangency 0 does not belong to [formula]. It implies that ([\ref=C1]) holds for g. Moreover, since ([\ref=C3]) is the condition about the transversality, it still holds after arbitrarily small perturbations of f. Consequently, g belongs to [formula]. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=thm3.1].

In the end of this section, we present the next lemma which is indispensable for our discussion in the final section. Since this is just an extract from the main result of [\cite=Tj01], we here skip the proof.

Let f be a Cr (r  ≥  2) diffeomorphism on a three-dimensional manifold M which has a homoclinic tangency of a saddle periodic point [formula] with real eigenvalues λ1,λ2,λ3 satisfying |λ1| < 1 < |λ2| < |λ3|. In addition, suppose that the homoclinic tangency satisfies the Tatjer condition. Then there are a two-parameter family [formula] with f0,0 = f and a sequence [formula] of the parameter values with (an,bn)  →  (0,0) as n  →    ∞   such that, for any sufficiently large n, fan,bn has an n-periodic smooth attracting invariant circle.

Note that the attracting invariant circles in Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] are really generated by the Hopf (also known as the Neimark-Sacker) bifurcation for three-dimensional diffeomorphisms, which is a part of the codimension-two bifurcation called Bogdanov-Takens, see Broer et al [\cite=BRS96], and also [\cite=Tj01].

Constructions of wandering domains

Let [formula] be the set of all Ck diffeomorphisms on a three-dimensional manifold M having smooth attracting invariant circles which are given by the Hopf bifurcation as in the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=lem3.2]. Here the regularity k should be at least 5 so that it can be expressed by the following normal form ([\ref=nf]) of the Hopf bifurcation, see [\cite=Rb]. More specifically, for any [formula], there exists a one-parameter family [formula] of C5 diffeomorphisms such that f0 is arbitrarily C5-close to f and fμ undergoes the generic Hopf bifurcation at an n-periodic point [formula] for some integer n  ≥  0 for μ = 0 which creates an attracting invariant circle. In fact, one has polar coordinates (r,θ) and a real coordinate t in a small neighborhood of [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula]

where Oμ(rk) is a smooth function of order rk with [formula] near (r,μ) = (0,0) which depends on μ smoothly, aμ, βμ are real constants depending on μ smoothly with a0  >  0, and γ is a real constant with 0 < |γ| < 1. Note that f restricted to the rθ-space has the same form as the normal form of the original two-dimensional Hopf bifurcation, see [\cite=Rb] or [\cite=Kuz] for more details. Observe that, as μ > 0, this form has a saddle periodic point at [formula] and has an attracting invariant circle surrounding [formula] of radius (μa- 1μ)1 / 2 + O(μ).

Using the notations [formula] and [formula], one can rewrite Lemma [\ref=lem3.2] as follows:

[formula] is contained in the C1 closure of [formula].

The next result is the final step for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Let f be a diffeomorphism contained in [formula]. There is a diffeomorphism g arbitrarily C1-close to f such that g has a contracting non-trivial wandering domain.

For [formula], one has a C5 diffeomorphism fμ arbitrarily C1-close to f such that fnμ given by ([\ref=nf]) has an attracting invariant circle S with [formula] for any [formula]. By perturbing fμ slightly if necessary, we may assume that [formula]. Moreover, since μ is close to 0, we have a diffeomorphism [formula] C1-near fμ such that

[formula]

in the neighborhood of [formula] of radius 2(μa- 1μ)1 / 2. It therefore follows that there is an attracting invariant circle S̃ and the restriction of n to S̃ is an irrational rigid rotation. Hence, by the same construction as that of Denjoy's counter-example, see [\cite=D32] and [\cite=Her79], we have a C1 diffeomorphism g arbitrarily C1-close to [formula], a sequence [formula] of open arcs which are contained in a circle Sg sufficiently C1-close to S̃ and satisfy the following conditions:

Sg is an attracting invariant circle for gn, and gn|Sg is topologically conjugate to an irrational rigid rotation;

for any i,j  ≥  0 with i  ≠  j,

[formula]

[formula] is a Cantor set on Sg.

We here consider a normal tubular neighborhood of each arc [formula], see Figure [\ref=fg5], which is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] is the open disk of radius δ centered at [formula] which lies in a plane normal to [formula] for each i  ≥  0, where δ > 0 is a given small number independent of x and i. By the form of ([\ref=nf]), the restrictions of fnμ(r,θ,t) to the first and third entries are contracting maps. It follows from this fact together with the wandering condition ([\ref=wi]) that

[formula]

for every i  ≥  0. In consequence, the open set D0 is a contracting non-trivial wandering domain for gn. Since [formula] for [formula], D0 is a contracting non-trivial wandering domain also for g.

We are at last ready to show the main result of this paper.

By Propositions [\ref=prop2.1], [\ref=thm3.1], and Corollary [\ref=coro3.3],

[formula]

Hence, for any [formula], there is an [formula] arbitrarily C1-close to f. By Proposition [\ref=prop4.1], we obtain a diffeomorphism g arbitrarily C1-close to [formula] which has a contracting non-trivial wandering domain. It implies that g is an element of [formula]. This completes the proof.
