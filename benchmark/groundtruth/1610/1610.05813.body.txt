Subgroups of FP2 groups

Introduction

The Higman embedding theorem is a high-point of combinatorial group theory that makes precise the connection between group presentations and logic: it states that a finitely generated group G embeds in some finitely presented group if and only if G is recursively presented, i.e., there is an algorithm to write down the relations that hold in G [\cite=higman].

A group G is FP2 if its augmentation ideal IG is finitely presented as a module for its group algebra [formula]. Every finitely presented group is FP2, and every FP2 group is finitely generated. Bestvina and Brady gave examples of FP2 groups that are not finitely presented [\cite=BB], although these examples arose as subgroups of finitely presented groups. In [\cite=ufp] the author constructed groups of type FP2 that do not embed in any finitely presented group. Given these examples it becomes natural to look for an analogue of the Higman embedding theorem for FP2 groups. Our main theorem answers this question.

Every countable group embeds in an FP2 group.

Our proof of this theorem is modelled on Valiev's proof of the Higman embedding theorem as described in [\cite=lynsch], which is a simplification of Valiev's first proof [\cite=valiev]. Our proof is much simpler than these antecedents because we are not obliged to consider recursive sets. We make the following definition, which is an analogue of Higman's notion of a benign subgroup.

A subgroup H of a finitely generated group G is a homologically benign subgroup if the HNN-extension

[formula]

can be embedded in an FP2 group.

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] implies that all subgroups of finitely generated groups are homologically benign, however showing that various subgroups are homologically benign plays a major role in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. The result below details what we need from [\cite=ufp]; after the statement we outline how to deduce it from results stated in [\cite=ufp].

For any fixed l  ≥  4 and any set S of integers with 0∈S, there is an FP2 group J = J(S) and a sequence [formula] of elements of J such that [formula] if and only if s∈S.

The groups GL(S) that are constructed in [\cite=ufp] depend on a connected flag simplicial complex L and a set [formula]. If L has perfect fundamental group and contains an edge loop of length l that is not homotopic to a constant map, then J = GL(S) has the claimed properties. See [\cite=ufp] for an explicit example of a suitable L in the case l = 4; examples for larger l can be obtained by taking subdivisions of this L.

We expand a little by giving the precise results within [\cite=ufp] that guarantee the various properties of the group J = J(S). When [formula], [\cite=ufp] gives a presentation for GL(S) with generators the directed edges of L. By [\cite=ufp], the group GL(S) is FP2 if and only if the fundamental group of L is perfect. If [formula] is a directed loop in L that does not bound a disk then by [\cite=ufp], the word [formula] in the given generators for J is equal to the identity if and only if s∈S.

Theorem [\ref=thm:fromufp] enables one to encode arbitrary subsets of [formula] in presentations for FP2 groups. This theorem replaces those parts of Valiev's proof that concern Diophantine equations or those parts of Higman's proof that concern Turing machines, each of which is used to encode recursive subsets of [formula] in finite presentations.

The proofs

Since this section is closely modelled on Lyndon and Schupp's account of the Higman embedding theorem [\cite=lynsch], we have tried to stay close to the notation that they use. We also omit arguments that are identical to those in [\cite=lynsch].

Since we will be working with presentations, it is convenient to have a characterization of the FP2 property in terms of presentations. Recall that the Cayley complex for a presentation of a group G is the universal cover of the presentation 2-complex. The group G acts freely on its Cayley complex, with one orbit of vertices and with orbits of 1- and 2-cells corresponding to the generators and relators respectively in the presentation. We define a partial Cayley complex to be a G-invariant subcomplex of the Cayley complex; partial Cayley complexes are in bijective correspondence with subcomplexes of the presentation complex.

Let H be given by a presentation with finitely many generators and a countable set of relators [formula]. The following are equivalent.

H is FP2.

There exists m so that for each i > m, the loop defined by ri represents zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex corresponding to all the generators and the relators [formula].

There is a connected free H-CW-complex with finitely many orbits of cells and perfect fundamental group.

Equivalence of (i) and (ii). Let X be the Cayley complex for H and let Xm be the partial Cayley complex containing all 1-cells and only the 2-cells that correspond to the relators [formula]. Let C*(X) and C*(Xm) denote the cellular chain complexes of X and Xm. The image of the map d1:C1(X)  →  C0(X) is isomorphic to the augmentation ideal IH. Hence H is FP2 if and only if the kernel of d1 is finitely generated as a [formula]-module. Since H1(X) is trivial, this kernel is equal to the image d2(C2(X)). The stated condition on loops is equivalent to d2(C2(Xm)) = d2(C2(X)). If this holds then clearly d2(C2(X)) is finitely generated. Conversely, any finite subset of d2(C2(X)) is contained in some d2(C2(Xm)), so if d2(C2(X)) is finitely generated then there exists m with d2(C2(Xm)) = d2(C2(X)).

(ii)[formula](iii) and (iii)[formula](i). Each Xi is a connected H-CW-complex with finitely many orbits of cells, and if (ii) holds then [formula] is trivial. Given any H-CW-complex Y as in (iii), pick a maximal subtree T in Y / H, let [formula] be the set of lifts of T in Y, and note that [formula] is equivariantly isomorphic to T  ×  H. The cellular chain complex [formula] gives a finite presentation for the relative homology group [formula] as a [formula]-module. Since H1(Y) = 0, [formula] is isomorphic to IH.

Next we give the homological version of the Higman Rope Trick [\cite=lynsch].

If R is a homologically benign normal subgroup of a finitely generated group F, then F / R is embeddable in an FP2 group.

Fix R as in the statement, and let H be an FP2 group containing the group FR  =  〈F,t:t- 1rt  =  r,    r∈R〉. Let L be the subgroup of FR  ≤  H generated by F and t- 1Ft, so that [formula]. As in [\cite=lynsch] there is a homomorphism φ:L  →  F / R whose restriction to F is equal to the quotient map F  →  F / R and whose restriction to t- 1Ft is the trivial homomorphism. Viewing L as a subgroup of H, the map l  ↦  (l,φ(l)) defines a second copy of L inside H  ×  F / R. Let K be the HNN-extension in which the stable letter conjugates these two copies:

[formula]

The group K is generated by the generators for H, the generators for F / R and the element s. As defining relators we may take the relators for F / R, the relators for H, finitely many relators stating that the generators for H and the generators for F / R commute, and finitely many relators of the form s- 1(l,1)s(l,φ(l))- 1 for l in some generating set for L. As in [\cite=lynsch], the relators that hold between the generators for F / R can be eliminated from this presentation for K, leaving just the relators for H and finitely many other relators.

To see that K is FP2, we use Proposition [\ref=prop:fp2] applied to the presentation 2-complex with the generators and relators described above. The generators and relators for H are contained in those for K, so we may look at the partial Cayley complex for K corresponding to just these generators and relators. This 2-complex is isomorphic to a disjoint union of copies of the Cayley complex for H (one copy for each coset of H in K). Let [formula] be an enumeration of the relators for H. Since H is FP2, there exists m so that for i > m, the relator ri represents zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex for H with just the relators [formula]. It follows that these same loops represent zero in the homology of the partial Cayley complex for K discussed above.

Now consider the partial Cayley complex for K, taking all the generators, the commutation relators between generators for H and F / R, the finitely many relators involving s, and the relators [formula]. For i > m, the loops in this complex defined by ri represent the zero element of homology, since they already represent 0 in the smaller partial Cayley complex consisting of a disjoint union of copies of the Cayley complex for H. Hence this presentation for K satisfies condition (ii) of Proposition [\ref=prop:fp2], and so K is FP2.

Let G be a finitely generated group which is embeddable in an FP2 group.

Every finitely generated subgroup of G is homologically benign in G.

If H and K are homologically benign subgroups of G, then so are their intersection and the subgroup that they generate.

Almost identical to the proof of [\cite=lynsch], except that it relies on the fact that a free product with amalgamation P = M * GN is FP2 provided that M and N are FP2 and G is finitely generated rather than on a similar statement for finite presentability. This can be proved easily using Proposition [\ref=prop:fp2].

Fix l  ≥  4, and for any integer s define [formula], an element of the free group [formula] of rank l + 3. For any [formula] with 0∈S, the subgroup

[formula]

is homologically benign and is freely generated by the given elements.

If a reduced word in the elements vs is written out in terms of the elements [formula], the only cancellation that can take place involves c0 and e. Thus the subwords [formula] survive uncancelled, which implies that the elements vs are free generators for the subgroup [formula] of H.

We claim that [formula] is benign, and hence homologically benign. To see this, define an ascending HNN-extension of the free group [formula] by

[formula]

Since u- 1vsu = vs + 1 for all [formula] and v0 = d it follows that

[formula]

Hence [formula] is benign in [formula] and therefore also in the free group H.

Fix some [formula], and claim that VS is homologically benign in H. To see this, let J = J(S) and [formula] be as in the statement of Theorem [\ref=thm:fromufp], and let

[formula]

The group K is FP2, since it has a presentation in which the only relators are the relators of J and finitely many commutation relators between [formula] and the generators of J. Note also that H is a retract of K, since the map ψ:K  →  H defined by

[formula]

is a group homomorphism.

Now define a homomorphism φ:K  →  K by

[formula]

It is easily checked that φ is an automorphism and that [formula]. Since [formula] is homologically benign in K, so is [formula]. Now consider the intersection [formula]. If [formula] are elements such that w = φ(w'), then w = w' since w = ψ(w) = ψ(φ(w')) = w'. Since φ(vs) = vs if and only if s∈S, it follows that [formula], and hence that VS is homologically benign.

As in [\cite=lynsch], let L be the free group L = 〈a,b〉, and let F be the free group of rank l + 6 with [formula]. Define a Gödel numbering γ of all words on the alphabet {a,b,a- 1,b- 1} by the formula

[formula]

and extending to longer words by concatenation, viewing a concatenation of digits as a number. Thus γ is a bijection between the words and the subset of [formula] consisting of zero and all integers whose decimal digits lie in the set {1,2,3,4}.

To any word w on {a,b,a- 1,b- 1}, associate a codeword gw∈L defined by

[formula]

The subgroup G of F generated by all the elements gw is freely generated by them.

The subgroup G is benign in F.

Almost identical to the argument in [\cite=lynsch]. Make a group F* defined as the fundamental group of a graph of groups with one vertex group F, and four edges corresponding to stable letters uλ for λ∈{a,b,a- 1,b- 1}, each of which defines an ascending HNN-extension of F with relations

[formula]

[formula]

In F*, we have that for any word [formula],

[formula]

and if w = uλ then uλgwu- 1λ  =  gu.

To show that G is benign in F, it suffices to show that in F*,

[formula]

From the equations given above, it is clear that the left-hand side is contained in the right-hand side. As in [\cite=lynsch], to prove the converse it suffices to show that whenever z∈G and λ∈{a,b,a- 1,b- 1} are such that uλzu- 1λ∈F, then in fact uλzu- 1λ∈G, or equivalently z∈u- 1λGuλ. For this, write [formula] as a reduced word in the elements gw, with εi  =    ±  1. When this expression for z is rewritten in terms of the generators for F and reduced, each subword of the form [formula] survives uncancelled, and any two such subwords are separated by a non-trivial word in the other generators a,b,c0,e,h. Each of the natural free generators for u- 1λFuλ except [formula] has total exponent of each ci divisible by 10. From this it follows that each γ(wi) is congruent to γ(λ) modulo 10, and hence that wi  =  xiλ for some shorter word xi, so that z∈u- 1λGuλ as required.

Every subgroup of the free group L = 〈a,b〉 is homologically benign.

Let N be a subgroup of L, and define a subset [formula] as the set of Gödel codes for words w on {a,b,a- 1,b- 1} that are equal (as elements of L) to an element of N:

[formula]

Now let YS be the free product [formula], where VS is as defined in the statement of Lemma [\ref=lem:anys]. By that lemma, VS is homologically benign, and hence YS is homologically benign in F. Since YS is freely generated by {a,b,h,vs:s∈S}, it is easy to see that [formula] is freely generated by {gw:w∈N}. (Recall that [formula].) Hence [formula] is homologically benign. The subgroup generated by [formula] and the finite set [formula], which is equal to [formula], is therefore also homologically benign and the intersection of this group with L is equal to N.

We are now ready to complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]. By the Higman-Neumann-Neumann embedding theorem [\cite=hnn] [\cite=lynsch], any countable group can be embedded in a 2-generator group. This 2-generator group is isomorphic to L / N for some normal subgroup N. By Corollary [\ref=cor:allbenign], N is homologically benign, and so by Lemma [\ref=lem:higrope], L / N can be embedded in an FP2 group.

Closing remarks

An opinion attributed to Gromov [\cite=gdelah] is that any statement that is valid for every countable group should be trivial. With this in mind, is there an easier, more direct proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]? Is there one that is not modelled on a proof of the Higman embedding theorem and that does not does not rely on Theorem [\ref=thm:fromufp], or other results from [\cite=BB] [\cite=ufp]?

The groups J = J(S) in Theorem [\ref=thm:fromufp] may be chosen to have cohomological dimension [formula] in addition to the stated properties. By keeping track of the cohomological dimension at each stage of the argument one obtains the following strengthened version of Corollary [\ref=cor:allbenign], and hence a strengthened version of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]:

For every subgroup N of the free group L = 〈a,b〉, the HNN-extension 〈L,t:t- 1nt = n      n∈N〉 embeds in an FP2 group of cohomological dimension five.

Every countable group G embeds in an FP2 group G*, with [formula]. Every torsion element in G* is conjugate to an element of G.

The proof of the Higman embedding theorem in [\cite=lynsch] shows that every recursively presented group G of finite cohomological dimension embeds in a finitely presented group G* of finite cohomological dimension. However, [formula] increases with the complexity of the Diophantine equation used to encode the relators in G. Applying Sapir's aspherical version of the Higman embedding theorem [\cite=sapir] gives the following.

For every recursive subgroup N of the free group L = 〈a,b〉, the HNN-extension 〈L,t:t- 1nt = n      n∈N〉 embeds in a finitely presented group of cohomological dimension two.

Combining this with the Higman rope trick [\cite=lynsch] gives a version of the Higman embedding theorem which is an analogue of Theorem [\ref=thm:maincd], but with a better bound on [formula].

Every recursively presented group G embeds in a finitely presented group G* with [formula]. Every torsion element in G* is conjugate to an element of G.
