On Two Conjectures about Permutation Trinomials over [formula]

= .5 - =0.9

Introduction

A permutation polynomial over a finite field is a polynomial that acts as a permutation of the elements of the filed. Permutation polynomials were first studied by Hermite [\cite=Hermite] for prime fields and by Dickson [\cite=Dickson] for arbitrary finite fields. Permutation polynomials over finite fields have wide applications in coding theory, cryptography and combinatorial designs, and it is of great interest in both theoretical and practical aspects to find new permutation polynomials. The reader is referred to [\cite=BTT] [\cite=Ding-QWYY] [\cite=Hou14] [\cite=Hou] [\cite=Hou15] [\cite=Li-Qu-Chen] [\cite=Tu-Zeng-Hu] [\cite=Tu-Zeng-Hu-Li] [\cite=Tu-Zeng-J] [\cite=Tu-Zeng-L-H] [\cite=Zeng] [\cite=ZTT] [\cite=ZZC] [\cite=Zieve-subgroup] for some constructions of permutation polynomials over finite fields.

Let p be a prime, m be a positive integer and [formula] denote the finite field with pm elements. An important class of permutation polynomials over the finite field [formula] is of the form

[formula]

where r,d are positive integers satisfying d  |  pm - 1, 1  ≤  r < (pm - 1) / d and [formula]. This class of permutation polynomials originated from the work of Dickson [\cite=Dickson-58], Carlitz and Wells [\cite=Carlitz-Wells] and Niederreiter and Robinson [\cite=Niederreiter-Robinson] who considered some special cases of the form [\eqref=form]. Wan and Lidl [\cite=Wan-Lidl] first provided a unified criterion for a polynomial with the form [\eqref=form] to be a permutation polynomial in terms of the primitive roots. Later, Park and Lee [\cite=Park-Lee] and Zieve [\cite=Zieve-09] studied this class of permutation polynomials and showed that the polynomial with the form [\eqref=form] is a permutation polynomial if and only if gcd (r,(pm - 1) / d) = 1 and xrh(x)(pm - 1) / d permutes the set μd of the d-th roots of unity in [formula]. In this sense, to determine the permutation property of [\eqref=form], the crucial step is to decide whether xrh(x)(pm - 1) / d permutes μd. However, this is still a difficult problem in general.

The construction of permutation trinomials with the form [\eqref=form] reattracts researchers' attention due to a recent work of Ding et al [\cite=Ding-QWYY]. Motivated by Ding et al.'s work, some new permutation trinomials of the form [\eqref=form] were obtained in [\cite=GS] [\cite=Li-Qu-Chen] [\cite=LQLF] [\cite=LH] by using different approaches in solving equations with low degree over finite fields and in [\cite=LH2] by using the property of the linear fractional polynomials over finite fields. The results obtained in [\cite=LH2] are the generalizations of some works in [\cite=Ding-QWYY] [\cite=GS] [\cite=Li-Qu-Chen] [\cite=LQLF]. In a very recent paper [\cite=LQLF], Li et al. constructed several classes of permutation trinomials of the form [\eqref=form] with m = 2k and d = pk + 1 for p = 2,3 and proposed three conjectures on permutation trinomials in such form for p = 3. This paper is devoted to settle two of the conjectures proposed in [\cite=LQLF]. The key step to solve the conjectures is to prove that a fifth-degree equation and a seventh-degree equation over [formula] have a unique solution in μ3k + 1, i.e., the set of the (3k + 1)-th roots of unity in [formula]. By analyzing the quadratic factors of the correseponding fifth-degree and seventh-degree polynomials over [formula], we can obtain their possible quadratic factors and then the conjectures can be settled based on further discussions on the solutions to the quadratic factors.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec-conj] introduces some notations and the conjectures proposed in [\cite=LQLF]. Sections [\ref=sec-pc-3] and [\ref=sec-pc-12] prove two of the conjectures by analyzing the quadratic factors of a fifth-degree polynomial and a seventh-degree polynomial over [formula] respectively, and some concluding remarks are given in Section [\ref=sec-cr].

The two conjectures on permutation trinomials over [formula]

Let p be a prime and m be a positive integer. A criterion for a polynomial in the form [\eqref=form] to be a permutation polynomial had been characterized by the following lemma which was proved by Park and Lee in 2001 and reproved by Zieve in 2009.

([\cite=Park-Lee] [\cite=Zieve-09]) The polynomial defined as in [\eqref=form] is a permutation over [formula] if and only if

gcd (r,(pm - 1) / d) = 1, and

xrh(x)(pm - 1) / d permutes the set of the d-th roots of unity in [formula].

Lemma [\ref=lem-Z] reduces the problem of determination of permutations over [formula] to that of determination of permutations over its subgroups. However, it is still a difficult problem to verify the second condition in Lemma [\ref=lem-Z]. By using Lemma [\ref=lem-Z], Li, Qu, Li and Fu presented several classes of permutation trinomials of the form [\eqref=form] with m = 2k and d = pk + 1 for p = 2,3 by solving certain low-degree equations over finite fields and finally they proposed three conjectures on permutation trinomials over [formula].

From now on, let m = 2k be a positive integer and q = 3k. The set of the (q + 1)-th roots of unity in [formula] is given as follows:

[formula]

(Conjecture 5.1, [\cite=LQLF])

Let q = 3k, k be even and f(x) = xlq + l + 5 + x(l + 5)q + l - x(l - 1)q + l + 6, where gcd (5 + 2l,q - 1) = 1. Then f(x) is a permutation trinomial over [formula].

Let q = 3k, f(x) = xlq + l + 1 - x(l + 4)q + l - 3 + x(l - 2)q + l + 3 and gcd (1 + 2l,q - 1) = 1. Then f(x) is a permutation trinomial over [formula].

Let q = 3k, f(x) = xlq + l + 1 + x(l + 2)q + l - 1 - x(l - 2)q + l + 3 and gcd (1 + 2l,q - 1) = 1. Then f(x) is a permutation trinomial over [formula] if [formula].

According to Lemma [\ref=lem-Z], Conjecture [\ref=conj-1] is equivalent to the following conjecture.

(Conjecture 5.2, [\cite=LQLF])

Let q = 3k, k be even and [formula]. Then g(x) permutes μq + 1.

Let q = 3k and [formula]. Then g(x) permutes μq + 1.

Let q = 3k and [formula]. Then g(x) permutes μq + 1 if [formula].

To prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-2], we need to show that for any g(x) listed above the equation g(x) = t has a unique solution in μq + 1 for any t∈μq + 1. Normally, it is a hard problem to determine the number of solutions to an equation (even with low degree) over finite fields. As pointed out by the authors in [\cite=LQLF], the main difficulty to prove these conjectures lies in dealing with some specified equations with high degree. In what follows, we aim to settle Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (2) and Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (3), for this goal we determine the quadratic factors of a fifth-degree polynomial and a seventh-degree polynomial and then show that g(x) = t cannot have distinct solutions in μq + 1 respectively.

Proof of Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (3)

To prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (3), we first show that x4 + x2 - 1 = 0 has no solution in μq + 1. Otherwise, we have xq + 1 = 1 = x4 + x2 which implies that xq = x3 + x. Taking q-th power on both sides gives x = x3q + xq = x- 3 + x- 1 which leads to x4 - x2 - 1 = 0, a contradiction with x4 + x2 - 1 = 0 and x∈μq + 1. On the other hand, it can be readily verified that g(x)q + 1 = 1 for any x∈μq + 1. Thus, to prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (3), it suffices to show that [formula] has a unique solution in μq + 1 for any t∈μq + 1 if [formula], which is equivalent to proving that the equation

[formula]

has at most one solution in μq + 1 for any t∈μq + 1 if [formula].

Let t∈μq + 1 and F(x) = x5 + tx4 - x3 + tx2 - x - t. If x2 + ax + b, where a,b  ≠  0, is a quadratic factor of F(x), then a,b must satisfy a2 = (ε - 1)b2 - (ε + 1)b + ε - 1, where ε2 + 1 = 0.

Proof.  Assume that F(x) can be factorized as F(x) = (x2 + ax + b)(x3  +  σ1x2  +  σ2x + σ3). Expanding the right hand side of F(x) and comparing the coefficients of x4 - i for [formula] gives

[formula]

From the first two identities in [\eqref=eq-coe] we have b + σ2 + a(t - a) =  - 1 and then σ2 = a2 - at - b - 1, and by the last two identities in [\eqref=eq-coe] we have a( - t / b) + bσ2 =  - 1 which leads to σ2 = (at - b) / b2. This implies that a2 - at - b - 1 = (at - b) / b2, i.e.,

[formula]

On the other hand, by the third identity in [\eqref=eq-coe] we have b2σ1 + abσ2 + bσ3 = bt which implies that b2(t - a) + a( - 1 - aσ3) + ( - t) = bt. Replacing σ3 by ( - t / b) gives b3t - b3a - ab + a2t - bt = b2t, then we obtain that

[formula]

We then can discuss the relation between a and b as follows:

Case 1: a + ab2 = 0. If this case happens, then we have b2 =  - 1 since a,b  ≠  0 and then [\eqref=eq-5th-1] implies a2b2 - b3 - b2 + b = 0 which leads to a2b2 - b(b2 - 1) - b2 = 0, i.e., a2 = 1 - b. By b2 =  - 1 we have ab3 + ab = 0 and then b3 - b2 - b + a2 = 0 due to [\eqref=eq-5th-2], i.e., a2 = b2 + b(1 - b2) =  - 1 - b, a contradiction with a2 = 1 - b. Thus, this case cannot happen.

Case 2: b3 - b2 - b + a2 = 0. For this case, we then have ab3 + ab = 0 according to [\eqref=eq-5th-2], i.e., b2 =  - 1 since a,b  ≠  0 and then from b3 - b2 - b + a2 = 0 we have a2 = b2 + b(1 - b2) =  - 1 - b. Again by b2 =  - 1 we can obtain a + ab2 = 0 which leads to a2b2 - b3 - b2 + b = 0 by [\eqref=eq-5th-1], i.e., a2 = 1 - b, a contradiction with a2 =  - 1 - b. Thus, this case cannot happen either.

Case 3: [formula] and [formula]. In this case, by [\eqref=eq-5th-1] and [\eqref=eq-5th-2] we have

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

since ab  ≠  0. Note that the discriminant of the above quadratic equation on variable a2 is Δ = (b - 1)4 + 4(b4 + 1) =  - (b + 1)4. This implies

[formula]

where ε2 + 1 = 0. Then the result follows from ε2 + 1 = ( - ε)2 + 1 = 0. This completes the proof. [formula]

For any t∈μq + 1 [\eqref=eq-5th] cannot have distinct solutions in μq + 1 if [formula].

Proof.  Suppose that [\eqref=eq-5th] have two distinct solutions x1,x2∈μq + 1, this means that the polynomial x5 + tx4 - x3 + tx2 - x - t has a quadratic factor x2 + ax + b satisfying x1 + x2 =  - a and x1x2 = b. Moreover, the two solutions can be expressed as

[formula]

This together with Lemma [\ref=lem-5th-ab] implies that

[formula]

where ε2 + 1 = 0. Note that [\eqref=eq-5th] has repeated roots if b =  - 1 and in this case the repeated root is x = ε according to Lemma [\ref=lem-5th-ab]. Next let b  ≠   - 1 and α be a primitive element of [formula], then ε  =    ±  α(q2 - 1) / 4 and by ε2 + 1 = 0 we have (ε - 1)2  =  ε. Then we can discussion [\eqref=eq-5th-x12] as below:

[formula]. For this case, we can obtain that [formula] which implies that [formula] due to (ε - 1)2  =  ε. Thus [\eqref=eq-5th] cannot have two distinct solutions in μq + 1 if [formula].

[formula]. In this case, by x1,x2∈μq + 1, we have [formula] which leads to

[formula]

On the other hand, according to x1 + x2 =  - a and x1x2 = b, we have b∈μq + 1 and - aq = xq1 + xq2 = (x1 + x2) / (x1x2) =  - a / b, i.e., bq = b- 1 and aq = a / b. Therefore, [\eqref=eq-5th-s] can be reduced to [formula] since a,b,(b + 1)  ≠  0. This is impossible since [formula] due to (ε - 1)2  =  ε and [formula].

Combining the above cases, we can conclude that [\eqref=eq-5th] cannot have distinct solutions in μq + 1 if [formula]. This completes the proof. [formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=lem-5th], we complete the proof of Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (3). Next we prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (2) in the same manner by analyzing the quadratic factors of a seventh-degree polynomial over [formula].

Proof of Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (2)

Notice that - x7 + x3 + x  ≠  0 if x∈μq + 1. Otherwise we have x6 - x2 = 1 = xq + 1 and then xq = x5 - x. Taking q-th power on both sides gives x = x5q - xq = x- 5 - x- 1 which leads to x6 + x4 - 1 = 0. This together with x6 - x2 - 1 = 0 gives x4 + x2 = 0, i.e., x2 =  - 1, a contradiction. Thus, we have - x7 + x3 + x  ≠  0 if x∈μq + 1. Then, for any x∈μq + 1, we have g(x)q + 1 = 1, i.e., g(x)∈μq + 1. Therefore, to complete the proof of Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (2), it is sufficient to show that [formula] has a unique solution for any t∈μq + 1, i.e., the equation

[formula]

has at most one solution in μq + 1 for any t∈μq + 1 for any positive integer k.

Similar as the proof of Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (3), we next show that [\eqref=eq-7th] cannot have distinct solutions in μq + 1 for any t∈μq + 1 by analyzing the possible quadratic factors of x7 + tx6 + tx4 - x3 - x - t over [formula]. Note that if [\eqref=eq-7th] have distinct solutions in μq + 1 then x7 + tx6 + tx4 - x3 - x - t must have a quadratic factor x2 + ax + b for some [formula] satisfying aqb = a according to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem-5th].

Let t∈μq + 1 and G(x) = x7 + tx6 + tx4 - x3 - x - t. If x2 + ax + b, where a,b  ≠  0 and aqb = a, is a quadratic factor of G(x), then a,b must satisfy one of the following conditions:

(a,b) = (ε, - 1), where ε2 + 1 = 0.

a2  =  θb2 - (θ - 1)b + θ, where θ3  -  θ - 1 = 0.

Proof.  Assume that G(x) can be factorized as G(x) = (x2 + ax + b)(x5  +  σ1x4  +  σ2x3  +  σ3x2  +  σ4x + σ5). Expanding the right hand side of G(x) and comparing the coefficients of x6 - i for [formula] gives

[formula]

and

[formula]

By a direct calculation, from [\eqref=eq-coe1-7th] we have σ1 = t - a, σ2 =  - aσ1 - b = a2 - at - b, σ3 = t - aσ2 - bσ1 = t - a3 + a2t - bt - ab and σ4 =  - 1 - aσ3 - bσ2 =  - 1 - at + a4 - a3t - abt + b2. On the other hand, by [\eqref=eq-coe2-7th], we can obtain σ5 =  - t / b, σ4 = ( - 1 - aσ5) / b = (at - b) / b2 and σ3 = ( - σ5 - aσ4) / b = (ab + bt - a2t) / b3. Therefore, by the value of σ3 we get t - a3 + a2t - bt - ab = (ab + bt - a2t) / b3, which can be written as

[formula]

and according to the value of σ4 we have - 1 - at + a4 - a3t - abt + b2 = (at - b) / b2, i.e.,

[formula]

Then we can discuss [\eqref=eq-7th-ab1] and [\eqref=eq-7th-ab2] as follows:

Case 1: a2b3 + a2 - b4 + b3 - b = 0. For this case, by [\eqref=eq-7th-ab1] we have a3b3 + ab4 + ab = 0, i.e., a2b2 + b3 + 1 = 0 since ab  ≠  0. Replacing b by a / aq and then multiplying by a3q gives a4aq + (a + aq)3 = 0, which leads to [formula] due to [formula]. Hence, again by aqb = a we get b = 1 and then a2 = 1. This contracts with a2b3 + a2 - b4 + b3 - b = 0. Thus this case cannot occur.

Case 2: a + ab2 + a3b2 + ab3 = 0, i.e., a2 =  - (b3 + b2 + 1) / b2. Then, [\eqref=eq-7th-ab2] implies that a4b2 + b4 - b2 + b = 0 which gives a4 =  - (b3 - b + 1) / b. From these two identities one gets (b3 + b2 + 1)2 / b4 =  - (b3 - b + 1) / b, which can be reduced to b6 + b5 + b2 - 1 = 0. Note that b6 + b5 + b2 - 1 = (b6 - 1) + b2(b3 + 1) = (b3 + 1)(b3 + b2 - 1). Thus we get b =  - 1 or b3 + b2 - 1 = 0. If b =  - 1, then a2 =  - (b3 + b2 + 1) / b2 =  - 1. If b3 + b2 - 1 = 0, then a2 =  - (b3 + b2 + 1) / b2 = 1 / b2, which means a2∈μq + 1 since b = a1 - q∈μq + 1, i.e., a2q + 2 = 1. Moreover, substituting b = a1 - q∈μq + 1 into a2b2 = 1 gives a4 - 2q = 1, which leads to a6 - 2q - 2 = a6 = (a2)3 = 1. That is, a2 = 1 and then b2 = 1, a contradiction with b3 + b2 - 1 = 0 due to b  ≠  0. Hence, this case happens only if a2 =  - 1 and b =  - 1.

Case 3: [formula] and [formula]. By [\eqref=eq-7th-ab1] and [\eqref=eq-7th-ab2], we have

[formula]

which can be reduced to a6 - (b + 1)4a2 - (b6 - b5 - b4 - b2 - b + 1) = 0 by a straight calculation since ab  ≠  0. If b =  - 1, then we have a6 + 1 = (a2 + 1)3 = 0, i.e., a2 =  - 1. If [formula], then the above equation can be rewriten as

[formula]

Observe that [formula]. Then, the above equation can be further written as

[formula]

which implies that [formula], i.e., a2  =  θb2 - (θ - 1)b + θ, where θ3  -  θ - 1 = 0. This completes the proof. [formula]

According to Lemma [\ref=lem-7th-ab], we can obtain the following desired result.

For any t∈μq + 1 [\eqref=eq-7th] cannot have distinct solutions in μq + 1 for any positive integer k.

Proof.  Suppose that [\eqref=eq-7th] have two distinct solutions x1,x2∈μq + 1, then x7 + tx6 + tx4 - x3 - x - t has a quadratic factor x2 + ax + b satisfying x1 + x2 =  - a and x1x2 = b which implies aqb = a. Moreover, the two solutions can be expressed as

[formula]

Note that x1  ≠  x2 means a2  ≠  b which indicates that the case b =  - 1 in Lemma [\ref=lem-7th-ab] cannot occur. Then, by Lemma [\ref=lem-7th-ab] (2), we can obtain

[formula]

where θ3  -  θ - 1 = 0. Since x3 - x - 1 is an irreducible polynomial over [formula], then by [\cite=Lidl-N] we have that x3 - x - 1 = 0 has solutions in [formula] if and only if [formula], i.e., [formula]. Thus, if [formula], then the second case in Lemma [\ref=lem-7th-ab] cannot occur and then [\eqref=eq-7th] cannot have two distinct solutions in μq + 1. Next we consider the case [formula]. In this case, we have [formula] due to [\cite=Lidl-N] . Moreover, by θ3  -  θ - 1 = 0, we have θ13  =  θ  ·  θ3  ·  θ9  =  θ(θ + 1)(θ - 1) = θ3  -  θ = 1. This implies that θ(q - 1) / 2 = 1 since [formula] if [formula]. On the other hand, by x1,x2∈μq + 1, we have [formula] which leads to

[formula]

This together with aq = a / b and bq = 1 / b gives [formula], a contradiction with θ(q - 1) / 2 = 1. Therefore, we can conclude that [\eqref=eq-7th] cannot have two distinct solutions in μq + 1 for any positive integer k. This completes the proof. [formula]

Thus, we complete the proof of Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (2) according to Lemma [\ref=lem-7th].

To end this section, we point out that Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (1) can be discussed in the same way. To prove Conjecture [\ref=conj-2] (1), we need to show that [formula] has a unique solution for any t∈μq + 1. Similar to Lemma [\ref=lem-7th-ab], by a direct calculation we can show that x7 + (t - 1)x6 + (t - 1)x - t has a quadratic factor x2 + ax + b, where ab  ≠  0 and aqb = a, only if a,b satisfy a6 + a5b + a5 + a4b - a3b2 - a3b - b6 - b3 - 1 = 0. Dividing a6 on both sides gives 1 + (b + 1) / a + b / a2 - (b2 + b) / a3 = (b + 1)6 / a6 - b3 / a6. Then, let u = a- 1 + a- q = (b + 1) / a and v = a- 1  ·  a- q = b / a2 we can get v3 - (u - 1)v - (u6 - u - 1) = 0, i.e., (v - 1)3 - (u - 1)(v - 1) - u6 = 0. However, currently we do not know how to use this identity to prove that x2 + ax + b = 0 cannot have distinct solutions in μq + 1 for even k.

Conclusion remarks

In this paper, by analyzing the possible quadratic factors of a fifth-degree polynomial and a seventh-degree polynomial over [formula], two of the conjectures on permutation trinomials over [formula] proposed recently by Li, Qu, Li and Fu in [\cite=LQLF] were settled.
