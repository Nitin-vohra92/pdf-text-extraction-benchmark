Abstract: The Descartes-Frenicle-Sorli conjecture predicts that k = 1 if qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q. In this note, we present some conditions equivalent to this conjecture. Keywords: Odd perfect number, abundancy index, deficiency. AMS Classification: 11A25.

Introduction

If N is a positive integer, then we write σ(N) for the sum of the divisors of N. A number N is perfect if σ(N) = 2N. We denote the abundancy index I of the positive integer w as [formula]. We also denote the deficiency D of the positive integer x as D(x)  =  2x  -  σ(x) [\cite=OEIS-A033879].

Euclid and Euler showed that that an even perfect number E must have the form

[formula]

where 2p  -  1 is a Mersenne prime. On the other hand, Euler showed that an odd perfect number O must have the form

[formula]

where q is an Euler prime (i.e., [formula] and gcd (q,n) = 1).

It is currently unknown whether there are any odd perfect numbers. On the other hand, only 49 even perfect numbers have been found, a couple of which were discovered by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search [\cite=GIMPS]. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many even perfect numbers, and that there are no odd perfect numbers.

Descartes, Frenicle and subsequently Sorli conjectured that k = 1 [\cite=Beasley]. Sorli conjectured k = 1 after testing large numbers with eight distinct prime factors for perfection [\cite=Sorli].

Holdener presented some conditions equivalent to the existence of odd perfect numbers in [\cite=Holdener]. In this paper, we prove the following results:

If N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q, then k = 1 if and only if

[formula]

If N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q, then

[formula]

If N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q, then

[formula]

holds if and only if k = 1 and q = 5.

All of the proofs given in this note are elementary.

Preliminaries

Let N = qkn2 be an odd perfect number with Euler prime q.

First, we show that the following equations hold.

If N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q, then

[formula]

Since N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number, we have

[formula]

from which it follows that qk|σ(n2) (because [formula]). Hence,

[formula]

is an integer.

First, we prove that

[formula]

We rewrite the equation

[formula]

as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and we are done.

Next, we show that

[formula]

We already know that

[formula]

Since σ(qk)σ(n2)  =  2qkn2, we also obtain

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

since

[formula]

This concludes the proof.

Dris obtained the lower bound 3 for σ(N / qk) / qk in [\cite=Dris1] and [\cite=Dris2]. The following papers obtain (ever-increasing) lower bounds for this quantity: [\cite=Dris-Luca], [\cite=Chen-Chen1], [\cite=Broughan-Delbourgo-Zhou], [\cite=Chen-Chen2].

Notice that

[formula]

since I(qk)  <  5 / 4 holds unconditionally (i.e., for k  ≥  1). Additionally, note that

[formula]

is true if qk  <  n.

Dris conjectured in [\cite=Dris1] that qk  <  n. Recently, Brown has announced a proof for q < n, and that qk  <  n holds "in many cases" [\cite=Brown].

It is an easy exercise to prove that qk  <  n implies the biconditional

[formula]

We refer the interested reader to MSE () for an expository proof.

Next, we prove the following lemmas.

If N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q, then

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

If

[formula]

then we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which then implies that k = 1. (Otherwise, if k > 1 we have

[formula]

since [formula], contradicting q  ≥  5.) Now, since k = 1, we get

[formula]

which implies that 1  ≤  q  ≤  5. Together with q  ≥  5, this means that q = 5. This concludes the proof.

If N = qkn2 is an odd perfect number with Euler prime q, then k = 1 implies

[formula]

Suppose that k = 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem:1], we have σ(n2) / q|n2. This implies that there exists an (odd) integer d such that

[formula]

Note that, from the equation σ(N) = 2N, we obtain (upon setting k = 1)

[formula]

from which we get

[formula]

Notice that, when k = 1, we can derive

[formula]

so that we have

[formula]

Additionally, note that, when k = 1, we have

[formula]

Consequently, we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and we are done.

The proof of Lemma 1.1

Let N = qkn2 be an odd perfect number with Euler prime q.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:3], we have

[formula]

This equation can be rewritten as

[formula]

Suppose that σ(n2) / q|n2. Trivially, we know that σ(n2) / q|σ(n2). Thus, we have

[formula]

giving

[formula]

This implies that I(qk - 1) is an integer. Since 1  ≤  I(qk - 1)  <  5 / 4, we obtain k = 1.

Now assume that k = 1. We obtain

[formula]

Again, since σ(n2) / q|σ(n2), this implies

[formula]

since σ(n2) / q is odd.

This concludes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:1].

The proof of Lemma 1.2

Let N = qkn2 be an odd perfect number with Euler prime q.

Assume to the contrary that

[formula]

Following the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:4], we get

[formula]

Since [formula], then k  ≥  1, which implies that

[formula]

This then finally gives 1  <  q  <  5, contradicting q  ≥  5.

We therefore conclude that

[formula]

and this finishes the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:2].

The proof of Theorem 1.1

Let N = qkn2 be an odd perfect number with Euler prime q.

We want to prove that the equation

[formula]

holds if and only if k = 1 and q = 5.

Suppose that

[formula]

Following the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:4], we get

[formula]

Assume to the contrary that k > 1. Since [formula], we obtain

[formula]

This contradicts q  ≥  5. Thus, we have established that k = 1.

Substituting k = 1 into 0  =  qk + 1  -  6q  +  5, we have

[formula]

which implies that q = 5 since q  ≥  5. This takes care of one direction of Theorem [\ref=thm:1].

For the other direction, assume that k = 1 and q = 5. We want to show that

[formula]

Note that, when k = 1 and q = 5, we obtain

[formula]

We also get

[formula]

so that we have

[formula]

as desired.

Concluding Remarks

By Lemma [\ref=lem:2] and Theorem [\ref=thm:1], we know that either of

[formula]

or

[formula]

is true. Recall that the first is equivalent to

[formula]

and that, in general,

[formula]

holds. We show here that, if

[formula]

then we obtain

[formula]

since I(n2)  ≥  5 / 3.

However, the Descartes-Frenicle-Sorli conjecture remains unresolved even with this new finding.
