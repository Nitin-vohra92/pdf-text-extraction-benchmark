Manifest and Subtle Cyclic Behavior in Nonequilibrium Steady States

Introduction

In the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation of equilibrium statistical mechanics, time plays no role. Once [formula], the set of configurations (or microstates) of the system of interest is chosen, the energy functional (Hamiltonian) [formula] is provided, and the conditions for equilibrium are specified, then [formula], the probability for finding the system in q is known. This structure is built on Boltzmann's fundamental hypothesis: [formula] for an isolated system with total energy E. From here, various other ensembles and their associated P's follow. The main task is to compute averages of various observable quantities [formula], [formula].

The Boltzmann-Gibbs paradigm is clearly inadequate to describe many stochastic processes in nature. In addition to a need to describe time dependent phenomena (e.g., autocorrelations), there are many systems which interact with the environment in a manner that violates time reversal. In particular, all biological systems consume nutrients and discard waste, with processes that clearly cannot be reversed in time. In this case, the system settles into non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), with characteristics absent from systems in thermal equilibrium. Chief among these are the presence of probability currents and loops [\cite=ZS2007], much like those in magnetostatics. In this brief note, we report some observable consequences of these current loops, in both manifestly cyclic behavior and more subtle realizations. We will also point to the notion of probability angular momentum and relate it to a more familiar quantity: the two point correlation at unequal times.

For the simplest stochastic process that leads to NESS, we may start with a master equation for the time dependent [formula], with rates that violate detailed balance (DB). In general, this equation takes the form

[formula]

where [formula] is the transition rate for the system in [formula] to become one in q and K(q'  →  q) is the net probability current from [formula] to q. Now, DB is often displayed as [formula], so that, for a system in thermal equilibrium with stationary [formula], the currents [formula] vanish identically. (Note that quantities in the stationary state are associated with [formula].) By contrast, for processes modeled by W's that violate DB, some [formula]'s in the NESS must be non-zero and must form closed loops.

Though the master equation is the most general formulation for this class of stochastic processes, we will restrict ourselves, for simplicity, to configuration spaces described by continuous variables, ξα (or just [formula]) in arbitrary dimensions, and evolution controlled by the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE):

[formula]

Here, D and V represent the diffusive and drift aspects, respectively. A more intuitive description, as well as rules for coding simulations, is the Langevin equation

[formula]

where [formula] is a Gaussian noise with [formula] and [formula]. As the FPE is just a continuity equation, we can identify the probability current here as [formula]. Of course, the stationary distribution, [formula], satisfies [formula], i.e., [formula]. In this approach, the dynamics satisfies DB provided [formula] is the gradient of some scalar function [formula], i.e., ∂γs. Then, it is straightforward to show that [formula] with [formula]. Our interest here are processes which violate this condition, when [formula] is non-trivial. Being divergenceless, it can be expressed (in 3 dimensions) as curl of [formula], the stream function (in the language of fluid dynamics), while [formula] is known as the vorticity, [formula].

Mass/fluid vs. probability angular momenta; two point correlation functions

Angular momentum, a familiar concept from textbooks on classical mechanics and fluid dynamics, is associated with mass in motion: [formula], [formula], and [formula] (where [formula] is the fluid current). We transfer this fluids concept to probability by considering the mapping [formula], so that [formula] is a quantity of interest and naturally named probability angular momentum.  Of course, in arbitrary dimensions, rotations and angular momenta are not vectors, but pseudo tensors. Thus, instead of a vector [formula], we should consider a matrix [formula], with elements Lαβ =  - Lβα and

[formula]

Note that, due to the normalization condition [formula], our mass is unity, so that the unit of [formula] is just ξ2 / t, precisely that of diffusion. This remarkable feature is not coincidental, as the intimate connection between them will be shown in the next section. We further note that, in a NESS, we have [formula], so that [formula] is independent of the choice of the origin of [formula] (and is just the total vorticity). Other familiar concepts such as angular velocity [formula] and inertia tensor, [formula], also have analogs. Specifically, we see that [formula] maps to the two point correlation [formula]. Meanwhile, in analog with [formula], we can define our angular velocity via Kα  =  ΩβαξβP [\cite=JBW2007] and come up with the equivalent of [formula].

We end this section with a not-so-familiar generalization of angular momentum. If the trajectory of a point mass [formula] is known, then we may consider the quantity [formula], the magnitude of which is just the area of the parallelogram spanned by the two vectors. Clearly, it is related to the angular momentum by [formula]. The analogous generalization to Lαβ here is a special two point correlation function:

[formula]

where P is the joint probability. If [formula], then P is the product of the conditional probability, [formula], and [formula]. Regarding the FPE (Eq. [\ref=eq:FPE]) as a Schrödinger equation, G is the familiar propagator in quantum mechanics. As in the point mass case, we have

[formula]

Meanwhile, we see that [formula] is just twice the antisymmetric part of the two point correlation at arbitrary times, [formula]. Being antisymmetric, it is necessarily odd under exchange [formula]. In the stationary state, translation invariance prevails and so, [formula] depends only on the difference [formula]. Since it is odd under time reversal, [formula] is a concrete measure of DB violation and irreversibility in a stationary state.

While the framework presented above is valid for all stochastic processes, it is valuable to illustrate these ideas in an explicitly solvable system: the Linear Gaussian Model (LGM) [\cite=Lax1966] [\cite=JBW2007] [\cite=ZS2007]. In an LGM, Dαβ (elements of [formula]) are constants, while [formula] is linear in [formula], as in generalized simple harmonic oscillators (SHO): [formula]. (Refer to Eqs. [\ref=eq:FPE] and [\ref=eq:Langevin].) Thus, the model is completely defined by two matrices, [formula] and [formula]. Of course, [formula] must be positive symmetric, while the real parts of the eigenvalues of [formula] must be negative (for the stability of the process). If [formula] is symmetric, then DB is satisfied and the scalar s is [formula]. If not, then the stationary [formula] is still a Gaussian[\cite=Lax1966]: [formula], where [formula] is fixed by [\cite=JBW2007] [formula] and S stands for the symmetric part of.  Clearly, [formula] is the covariance matrix in the steady state, i.e., the equal time two point function. (Note that [formula] is not the same as [formula]!) Meanwhile, we have [formula], which leads to [formula]. Since [formula], the sum [formula] is [formula], the antisymmetric part of [formula]. Thus, [formula] is manifestly divergence free while the stream function (a matrix here) can be identified as [formula]. Moreover, it is straightforward to obtain an explicit expression for [formula]:

[formula]

and its generalization:

[formula]

In this setting, we see that diffusion ([formula]) and angular momentum ([formula]) are just the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of one matrix: [formula]. Thus, they must have the same units, and play complementary roles in any stochastic process. Finally, note that the angular velocity matrix is given by [formula] [\cite=JBW2007], while [formula] is the analog of [formula].

Distributions of [formula]

Having established that there must be some cyclic behavior in any NESS, we ask if this feature is displayed (a) prominently and manifestly, or (b) in some obscure and subtle way. To answer which category a system belongs to, we must go beyond the average values of angular momenta (Eqs. [\ref=Lab] and [\ref=L*]) and study the full distribution: [formula]. For simplicity, let us consider a two-dimensional [formula]-space, so that there is only one independent component in any antisymmetric matrix, e.g., [formula]. Then, our task simplifies to the study of [formula]. From simulations, it can be obtained by computing [formula] from a long trajectory [formula] (in the steady state), and compiling a histogram.

Clearly, the most extreme example in category (a) is a deterministic orbit (e.g., Keplerian) which yields a fixed angular momentum: [formula]. More common, stochastic systems of this type will display broader p's. To illustrate, we consider a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model [\cite=LV2026] for the population of hares and lynx, ξh and ξl respectively. A specific example, associated with the upper panels of Fig. 1, is:

[formula]

plus noise. The figure shows a typical trajectory in the space of hare/lynx populations from a simple simulation run, as well as the associated distribution [formula]. Clearly, the latter is the result of noise on a δ distribution. Since the dynamics of such models manifestly violate time reversal symmetry and DB, a distribution dominated by one sign of L is expected. Turning to the subtler NESS in category (b), the average [formula] can be quite small, the result of a broad [formula] with only a slight asymmetry in L. Let us illustrate with two SHO's coupled to thermal baths at different T's [\cite=ZT1998]. Starting with the standard Hamiltonian [formula] we model the effects of the thermal baths by

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Since this system is precisely an LGM, we find [formula], which shows that it settles into a NESS only when k×    ≠  0 and T1  ≠  T2. In the lower left panel of Fig. 1, we show a typical trajectory, which displays no obvious preferential rotation. The right panel shows a nearly symmetric [formula], with barely discernible asymmetry. As a result, the average [formula] is much smaller than the standard deviation ΔL  ~  32.41  ×  10- 3. Here, we find [formula] to be entirely consistent with the theoretical prediction of 4.66  ×  10- 3. Finally, we note that the large L behaviors are exponential, governed by different decay constants. These can also be computed, since we can obtain analytically the full [formula] of Gaussian models (details to be published elsewhere [\cite=NMFWZ2016]).

Apart from these simple examples, we have recently studied other systems in NESS, including an epidemic model with asymmetric infection rates [\cite=SZ2014] and a heterogeneous non-linear q-voter model [\cite=MMZ2016]. Both settle into NESS that display only very subtle cyclic behavior. Here, let us present preliminary results concerning a much larger and complex system: variations in the heat content of our oceans. As a stochastic process, the oceans are heated in the tropical regions and suffer loss mostly from the polar regions, forming clearly a non-equilibrium system. Over long periods, it appears quasi-stationary and may be regarded as a NESS. Unfortunately, high quality data for these anomalies in the real oceans form only a small set and date from about half a century ago [\cite=NOAA]. Nevertheless, we can combine the data into two time series, [formula] and [formula], and study both [formula] and [formula]. The results are very similar to those of the SHO's in Fig. 1. The details are quite complicated and will be published elsewhere [\cite=NMFWZ2016]. Here, we turn to a much longer (about a millennium) data set, created using the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model [\cite=CESM]. Though non-trivial complications concerning the analysis also exist here [\cite=NMFWZ2016], the results are consistent with the those from real data. Illustrating with a small portion of this trajectory and showing the [formula] in Fig. 2, we recognize that these NESS aspects are similar to those in the two-temperature SHO case. However, there is a subtle difference: [formula] is negative, a sign naively opposite to that in the SHO's. This difference indicates that temperature difference is not the only controlling factor for the sign of [formula]. The more significant factor is the level of the noise associated with each degree of freedom. Details of this kind of analysis and understanding will be presented elsewhere [\cite=NMFWZ2016].

Summary and Outlook

We have shown that the angular momenta [formula] and the two point correlation at unequal times [formula] are, for any NESS, excellent measures of the underlying time-reversal and DB violating dynamics. Beyond these simplest quantities, any multipoint correlation functions at unequal times will provide a platform for measuring such characteristics. In recent years, there has been other attempts to characterize cyclic behavior in NESS, e.g., those by Russell and Blythe [\cite=RB2013]. These approaches rely on the properties of angular displacements (in conffiguration space) rather than angular momenta. While there are some advantages to the former (e.g., intuitively understandable, independence of the scales of [formula]), there are also disadvantages (e.g., over-emphasis of motion near the origin, non-anayticity at [formula]). By contrast, [formula] is analytically tractable, while it also enjoys intimate relationships with other key quantities, such as the probability current [formula], the two point function [formula], and the diffusion matrix [formula].

We have also shown that, for certain systems in NESS, DB violation is so patently obvious that the irreversible nature is prominent and manifest. For example, hares do not prey on lynxes! On the other hand, many NESS do not display such clear behavior, as the time-reversal violating aspects are more obscure and subtle. Clearly, it is desirable to understand more deeply the mechanisms which control the outcomes of a system. What are the parameters which, when varied continuously, will take a system from category (a) to (b)? Is the transition abrupt and discontinuous? or smooth and continuous? Is it possible that [formula] displays a combination of both components ? We believe this is a promising and rich avenue for future research, both as a novel measure to characterize different systems in NESS and as a possible step towards a overarching framework for the foundations of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
