Since a subset of eigenstates of the problem of three anyons in a harmonic potential was worked out analytically in [\cite=Wu84] (the energy eigenvalues of those states depend linearly on the statistics parameter α), much effort has been invested in finding out the remaining ("missing") ones. The results of perturbative and numerical investigations using different approaches (see [\cite=MMO] and references therein) are all in perfect agreement with each other and demonstrate, in particular, that the energies of those "missing" states interpolate nonlinearly between the bosonic and fermionic limits--except for one claim (not supported by any calculation) to the effect that the states in question do not exist at all, violating the continuity of the spectrum [\cite=CR92].

In the papers [\cite=R95] [\cite=R96], it is argued instead that the energies of the "missing" states depend linearly on α; the continuity of the spectrum is still violated [\cite=R95]. In [\cite=R96], a wave function (7) that turns into the one of the fermionic ground state for α = 1 is proposed. It is then correctly argued that when, say, z3 =  - z2 (with zj the complex particle coordinates) and z1 describes a small circle around the origin, an anyon wave function should not change, because no particles are encircled in the process. Yet the wave function (7) will in fact change. The reason is of course that it contains a piece [formula] (9), with [formula] where η  =   exp (2πi / 3), so that for z3 =  - z2 one has [formula]; consequently, rotating z1 around the origin counterclockwise supplies Φ0 with a phase factor of exp (4iπα) per revolution. Thus the wave function in question is not a three-anyon wave function. The very same argument applies to the whole class of wave functions of [\cite=R95].

The reasoning in the last paragraph of Sec. III of [\cite=R96], where it is claimed that a wave function with the correct interchange properties can be built out of (7), amounts essentially to the following: Given a function f(ζ) = ζα, one wants to turn it into a single-valued function (i.e., a one that would not change as a result of ζ making a revolution around the origin). There is certainly no way to accomplish this without making the function discontinuous, which a wave function cannot be.

To conclude, a striking disagreement of the results of [\cite=R95] [\cite=R96] with the well-established knowledge comes from the fact that the issue of multivaluedness of anyon wave functions has not been properly taken into account in the papers in question.
