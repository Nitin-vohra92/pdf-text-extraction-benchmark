Dark Matter: a Challenge to Standard Gravity or a Warning?

While the main thrust of current research is to meet the challenge of determining the precise nature and form of the dark matter which is widely thought to dominate the universe on large distance scales, nonetheless, given so startling a requirement as this, it is not inappropriate to ask whether this very need for dark matter, and in such copious proportions, might not instead be a warning that the standard Newton-Einstein theory might not in fact be the right one for gravity. Now while the standard theory was first established on solar system distance scales, for the moment its extrapolation to much larger distances is precisely just that, since there is not yet a single independent verification of Newton's Law of Gravity on galactic or larger distance scales which does not involve an appeal to dark matter, to thus show the complete circularity of the very reasoning which leads to dark matter in the first place. Thus at the present time observation can only mandate that gravity be a covariant theory whose metric reproduces the familiar Schwarzschild systematics on solar system distance scales, with (as noted long ago by Eddington) this actually being readily achievable in theories of gravity of order higher than the standard second order one. Since such higher order theories would however then also depart from Schwarzschild at larger distances [\cite=MannheimandKazanas1994] their phenomenological candidacy is immediate. In fact, motivated by the underlying conformal invariance of the three other fundamental interactions, Mannheim and Kazanas considered the candidacy of one explicit higher order theory, viz. fourth order conformal gravity, and found [\cite=MannheimandKazanas1989] that outside of a static, spherically symmetric system such as a star the exact metric takes the form - g00  =  1 / grr = 1 - 2β* / r  +  γ*r, to thus precisely recover the Schwarzschild metric on small enough distances while both generalizing it and departing from it on much larger ones.

While higher order theories of gravity such as conformal gravity thus yield potentials which then dominate over the Newtonian one at large distances just as desired, the very fact that they do so entails that one is now no longer able to ignore the potentials due to distant matter sources outside of individual gravitational systems such as galaxies. Thus once we depart from the second order theory, we immediately transit into a world where we have to consider effects due to matter not only inside but also outside of individual systems, and we are thus led [\cite=Mannheim1995a] [\cite=Mannheim1996a] [\cite=Mannheim1996b] to look for both local and global imprints on galactic rotation curve data, this being a quite radical (and quite Machian) conceptual departure from the standard purely local Newtonian world view.

To isolate such possible global imprints, it is instructive [\cite=Mannheim1995a] [\cite=Mannheim1996a] [\cite=Mannheim1996b] to look at the centripetal accelerations of the data points farthest from galactic centers. In particular, for a large set of galaxies whose rotation curve data are regarded as being particularly characteristic of the pattern of deviation from the luminous Newtonian expectation that has so far been obtained, it was found that these farthest centripetal accelerations could all be parameterized by the universal three component relation (v2 / R)last  =  γ0c2 / 2 + γ*N*c2 / 2  +  β*N*c2 / R2 where γ0 = 3.06  ×  10- 30 cm- 1, γ* = 5.42  ×  10- 41 cm- 1, β* = 1.48  ×  105 cm, and where N* is the total amount of visible matter (in solar mass units) in each galaxy. Since the luminous Newtonian contribution is decidedly non-leading at the outskirts of galaxies, we thus uncover the existence of two linear potential terms which together account for the entire measured departure from the luminous Newtonian expectation (not only for these farthest points but even [\cite=Mannheim1996a] [\cite=Mannheim1996b] for all the other (closer in) data points as well in fact). Now while the γ*N*c2 / 2 term can immediately be identified as the net galactic contribution due to the linear γ*c2R / 2 potentials of all the N* stars in each galaxy, the inferred γ0c2 / 2 term is on a quite different footing since it is independent of the mass content N* of each of the individual galaxies. Moreover, since numerically γ0 is found to have a magnitude of order the inverse Hubble radius, we can thus anticipate that it must represent a universal global effect generated by the matter outside of each galaxy (viz. the rest of the matter in the universe), and thus not be associated with any local dynamics within individual galaxies at all.

The emergence of the γ0c2 / 2 term, a term which may be thought of as being a universal acceleration, immediately raises some questions. First, if it is an acceleration, then with respect to which frame is the acceleration - and no matter which particular one (the Hubble flow itself being the only apparent covariant possibility), how could it possibly be universal for each and every galaxy. And moreover, how could γ0 be related to the Hubble radius at all since the Hubble parameter is not a static, time independent quantity. As we shall see, conformal gravity provides [\cite=Mannheim1995a] [\cite=Mannheim1996a] [\cite=Mannheim1996b] answers to all these questions. Specifically, it was noted quite early on [\cite=MannheimandKazanas1989] that the general coordinate transformation r = ρ / (1 - γ0ρ / 4)2, [formula] transforms the metric ds2 = (1 + γ0r)c2dt2 - dr2 / (1 + γ0r) - r2dΩ into ds2  =  Λ(ρ,τ){c2dτ2  -  R2(τ)(dρ2  +  ρ2dΩ) / (1 - ρ2γ20 / 16)2} (where the conformal factor Λ(ρ,τ) is given by (1 + ργ0 / 4)2  /  R2(τ)(1 - ργ0 / 4)2), to yield a metric which is conformal to a Robertson-Walker metric with scale factor R(τ) and explicitly negative 3-space scalar curvature k =  - γ20 / 4, with this metric in fact being none other than that explicitly found [\cite=Mannheim1992] [\cite=Mannheim1995b] in conformal cosmology where only an open universe with explicitly negative k is realizable. Now, in a geometry which is both homogeneous and isotropic about all points, any observer located at the center of any comoving galaxy can serve as the origin for the coordinate ρ. Thus in his own local rest frame each such comoving observer is able to make the above coordinate transformation with the use of his own particular ρ, to then find that in his own frame the entire Hubble flow then acts as a universal linear potential coming directly from the spatial curvature of the universe; with galactic test particles then experiencing a universal acceleration γ0c2 / 2 which is explicitly generated by the rest of the matter in the universe. Thus we see that rather then being an acceleration with respect to the Hubble flow (a non-relativistic notion), explicitly because of relativity, the universal acceleration in fact emerges as an intrinsic property of the Hubble flow itself as seen in each comoving observer's rest frame. Moreover, with it also emerging as the spatial curvature, it is then also a nicely time independent quantity, with the numerical determination of γ0 given above actually yielding an explicit value for both the sign and magnitude of the spatial curvature of the universe, something which years of intensive work has yet to accomplish in the standard theory. Thus to conclude, it would appear from our analysis that there is something explicitly global at play in galactic dynamics, something not only quite suggestive of conformal gravity but also seemingly somewhat foreign to the standard gravitational paradigm.
