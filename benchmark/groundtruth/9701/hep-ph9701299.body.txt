Abstract

We calculate the rate of the decay μ  →  eγ and the electric dipole moment of the electron in the left-right supersymmetric model when the breaking of parity occurs at a considerably large scale. The low-energy flavor violation in the model originates either from the nonvanishing remnants of the left-right symmetry in the slepton mass matrix or from the direct flavor changing lepton-slepton-neutralino interaction. The result is found to be large for the masses of the supersymmetric particles not far from the electroweak scale and already accessible at the current experimental accuracy. It also provides nontrivial constraints of the lepton mixing in the model.

Introduction

The quest for a supersymmetric grand unified theory is plagued by lack of direct signals which would distinguish such a theory from supersymmetry in general. Supersymmetry, in particular the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM)  [\cite=habnil], can be probed experimentally through the high energy production of superpartners. However, the MSSM, while filling in some of the theoretical gaps of the Standard Model, fails to explain other phenomena such as the weak mixing angle, the small mass (or masslessness) of the known neutrinos, the origin of CP violation, to mention a few. Extended gauge structures such as grand unified theories, introduced to provide an elegant framework for unification of forces [\cite=ellis], would connect the standard model with more fundamental structures such as superstrings, and also resolve the puzzles of the electroweak theory.

Phenomenologically, grand unified theories would predict either relationships between otherwise independent parameters of the standard model, or new interactions (i.e. interactions forbidden or highly suppressed in the standard model).

Among supersymmetric grand unified theories SO(10) [\cite=barbieri1] and SU(5) [\cite=barbieri2] have received significant attention. It is known that the rates of processes with flavor number violation, such as μ  →  eγ, μ  →  3e and μ - e conversion on nuclei are significantly enhanced in comparison with the pure MSSM case and are just one order of magnitude below the current experimental limit. In this article we shall study a model, the left-right symmetric extension of the MSSM, based on SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B - L [\cite=frank1] [\cite=rasin] [\cite=huitu]. We show that this model shares some interesting features of the unified models providing the nonvanishing remnants of the left-right symmetry in the slepton mass matrix even if the right-handed scale is far from the electroweak one. Its attraction is twofold: first, the Left-Right Supersymmetric Model (LRSUSY) is an extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model based on left-right symmetry, and second, it could be viewed as a low-energy realization of certain SUSY - GUTs, such as SO(10). However, the left-right symmetry, being much less restrictive assumption than unification itself, does not relate the mixing angles in lepton and quark sectors. In particular, evaluating the μ  →  eγ decay we show that this model can provide both smaller and larger rates than in unified theories depending mainly on the size of the mixing in the lepton sector.

Since the measurement of μ  →  eγ has a very stringent bound B(μ  →  eγ)  <  4.9  ×  10- 11  [\cite=particle_data], we are able to obtain values close to the experimental bound and restrict some of the parameters in the theory.

Our paper is organized as follows: in section [\ref=lrsusy] we give a brief description of the model, followed by the analysis of different flavor-violating mechanisms in section 3. The amplitude of the decay μ  →  eγ is analyzed in section 4. Our conclusions are reached in section [\ref=concl].

The Left-Right Supersymmetric Model

The LRSUSY model, based on SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B - L, has matter doublets for both left- and right- handed fermions and the corresponding left- and right-handed scalar partners (sleptons and squarks) [\cite=frank3]. In the gauge sector, corresponding to SU(2)L and SU(2)R, there are triplet gauge bosons (W+ , -,W0)L, (W+ , -,W0)R and a singlet gauge boson V corresponding to U(1)B - L, together with their superpartners. The Higgs sector of this model consists of two Higgs bi-doublets, [formula] and [formula], which are required to give masses to both the up and down quarks. In addition, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the group SU(2)R  ×  U(1)B - L to the hypercharge symmetry group U(1)Y is accomplished by introducing the Higgs triplet fields ΔL(1,0,2) and ΔR(0,1,2). The choice of the triplets (versus four doublets) is preferred because with this choice a large Majorana mass can be generated for the right-handed neutrino and a small one for the left-handed neutrino  [\cite=mohapatra]. In addition to the triplets ΔL,R, the model must contain two additional triplets δL(1,0, - 2) and δR(0,1, - 2) , with quantum number B - L =  - 2 to insure cancellation of the anomalies that would otherwise occur in the fermionic sector.

As in the standard model, in order to preserve U(1)EM gauge invariance, only the neutral Higgs fields acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values (VEV's). These values are:

[formula]

〈Φ〉 causes the mixing of WL and WR bosons with CP-violating phase ω. In order to simplify, we will take the VEV's of the Higgs fields as: 〈ΔL〉  =  0 and

[formula]

Choosing vL  =  κ' = 0 satisfies the more loosely phenomenologically required hierarchy vR  ~    ≫   ~ max(κ,κ') ~   ≫   ~ vL and also the required cancellation of flavor-changing neutral currents. The Higgs fields acquire non-zero VEV's to break both parity and SU(2)R. In the first stage of breaking the right-handed gauge bosons WR and ZR aquire masses proportional to vR and become much heavier than the usual (left-handed) neutral gauge bosons WL and ZL, which pick up masses proportional to κu and κd at the second stage of breaking.  [\cite=frank1]

The supersymmetric sector of the model, while preserving left-right symmetry, has four singly-charged charginos ( corresponding to λ̃L,λ̃R,φ̃u, and φ̃d), in addition to -L , -R , -L and -R. The model also has eleven neutralinos, corresponding to λ̃Z, [formula], λ̃V , φ̃01u ,φ̃02u , φ̃01d , φ̃02d, 0L, 0R 0L, and 0R.

In the scalar matter sector, the LRSUSY contains two left-handed and two right-handed scalar fermions as partners of the ordinary leptons and quarks, which themselves come in left- and right-handed doublets. In general the left- and right-handed scalar leptons will mix together. Some of the effects of these mixings, such as enhancement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, have been discussed elsewhere [\cite=frank1].

Sources of flavor violation in LRSUSY

The interaction of fermions with scalar (Higgs) fields has the following form:

[formula]

LR symmetry requires all Y-matrices to be hermitean in the generation space and F matrix to be symmetric.

The off-diagonal entries in matrices Yν, Ye and F are responsible for the lepton flavor violation in the theory.

In what follows we consider the effects related to the neutrino Yukawa couplings Yν. The seesaw mechanism allows to have large Yukawa couplings and at the same time escape the constraints coming from the neutrino mass data if the scale of the right-handed physics is higher than 100 TeV. Indeed, if FvR is large, the Yukawa couplings Yν could be very large and there is the possibility of having Yντ of the order 1. Therefore, the seesaw mechanism could provide large amount of flavor violation in the leptonic sector [\cite=LRmu]. In what follows we will concentrate on the specific LRSUSY-related mechanisms for the lepton flavor violation.

In complete analogy with the quark sector [\cite=kaon] the flavor changing transitions between charged leptons are proportional to the Dirac Yukawa couplings of neutrinos:

[formula]

where we use already the mass eigenstate representation. Here V is the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix in the lepton sector. The neutral Higgs particles associated with φ02u have to be very heavy in order to suppress the FCNC contribution to the neutral kaon mixing. Therefore, the direct contribution of this interaction to the lepton violating processes is negligibly small because corresponding one-loop diagram is suppressed as m2FCNC. However, in supersymmetric model we have to consider other possible interactions of the same origin involving higgsinos:

[formula]

Here we do not have strict phenomenological restrictions on the mass of the corresponding higgsino and therefore the interaction ([\ref=eq:FCNC1]) is very important for the muon conversion or decay.

If the FCNC higgsino happens to be heavy we have to consider different sources of flavor violation related with the scalar lepton mass matrix. Flavor violating terms in the slepton mass matrix arise as a result of the renormalization group evolution from the ΛGUT scale and are caused by the admixture of the neutrino Yukawa couplings. Instead of calculating this matrix, which could be done only numerically, we adopt here the following anzatz for the charged slepton matrix with some elements of the left-right symmetry [\cite=Posp]:

[formula]

where Ae = A(Me + aeλ2eMe  +  aνλ2νMe + a'νMeλ2ν) - Meμ tan β. The coefficients cν,  c'ν,  ce,  c'e,  ae,  aν,  a'ν appear either at the tree level or in the one-loop renormalization from ΛGUT. The requirement of the L-R symmetry is:

[formula]

As a result, the mass matrix ([\ref=eq:mass]) differs from that of the MSSM where cν' = 0 and aν' = 0. The values of all these coefficients depend on many additional parameters and we simply assume here the following estimate:

[formula]

When the left-right symmetry is broken, the relations ([\ref=eq:LR]) become approximate and we expect [formula] [\cite=rasin] [\cite=Posp]

Next we consider the implications of these FCNC mechanisms in the LRSUSY in lepton-flavor violating decay μ  →  eγ.

The Decay μ  →  eγ

The amplitude of the μ  →  eγ transition can be written in the form of the usual dipole-type interaction:

[formula]

It leads to the partial width

[formula]

Comparing it with the standard decay width, [formula] and using the experimental constraint on the branching ratio, we get the following limit on d [\cite=ft]:

[formula]

In what follows we calculate d due to different sources of flavor violation. We note that there are two general classes of contributions to d. First, there are terms proportional to the mass of muon divided by the square of supersymmetric mass scale, mμ / M2. The second class of contributions are terms proportional to the mass of the tau lepton, mτ / M2. We concentrate our analysis on the second class and calculate the corresponding d. The enhancement factor, mτ / mμ, associated with this subclass allows us to consider only the diagrams with the chirality flip on the slepton line and neglect at the moment all other contributions. In some sense, we assume from the very beginning that the mixing with the third generation is significant and of the same order as the mixing in the μ - e sector.

To obtain the amplitude of μ  →  eγ derived from the flavor-violating mechanisms in the previous section we have to calculate the one-loop diagrams of Fig. 1.

In the neutral higgsinos exchange the leading contribution is due to the superpartner of the field φ02u corresponding to the FCNC Higgs ([\ref=eq:FCNC1]). It gives the amplitude:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us suppose for a moment that at the GUT scale we have the unification of quarks and leptons in the form of a close correspondence between Yukawa couplings and mixing angles, V31  ~  Vtd, V32  ~  Vts, Yντ  ~  Yt. Then our result leads to the following numerical estimate, where we take the common mass for all supersymmetric parameters, M  ~  mh  ~  (A - μ tan β), F≃1 / 12:

[formula]

which is already larger than the current experimental limit. Alternatively, we can translate Eq. ([\ref=eq:I]) into the following limit:

[formula]

Another group of diagrams proportional to mτ which we have to consider here is that of Fig. 2 where the fermion line in the loop corresponds to the propagation of the bino, the superpartner of the U(1) gauge boson. The flavor violation comes through mass insertions in the slepton line. These insertions are indicated as small bubbles. The superpartners of SU(2)L or SU(2)R are not interesting because they couple only to left- or right-handed fermions and cannot lead to mτ-proportional effects since these require a helicity flip. Using the estimate ([\ref=eq:coeff]) and for mh  ~  M, the result reads as follows:

[formula]

It gives a different dependence of Yukawas, Y4ντ. The constraints which could be obtained from ([\ref=eq:II]) are one-two orders of magnitude weaker in comparison with ([\ref=eq:limit1]) , mainly due to the factor 4π  ~  0.1.

These two mechanisms exhaust all possible supersymmetric contributions to d proportional to the mass of the tau lepton. As to the diagrams with the charged higgsinos, they are irrelevant for our analysis since we know that large vR leads to the decoupling of the right-handed sneutrinos through the corresponding couplings in the supersymmetric F-term.

Lastly, we obtain an estimate of the electric dipole moment of the electron in this model due to the complex phases in the lepton Yukawa couplings. The mechanism analogous to ([\ref=eq:I]) leads to the following estimate:

[formula]

where J = (V21V*31V32V*22) is the CP-odd rephasing invariant of the leptonic KM matrix and [formula] is the relative difference between left- and right-handed slepton masses. The corresponding constraint on the CP-odd combination of mixing angles and Yukawa couplings reads as follows:

[formula]

which is definitely weaker than constraints coming from the muon decay if we believe that Yμ  ~  Yc  ~  10- 2.

Conclusions

We have evaluated the μ  →  eγ decay rate and we have shown that the left-right supersymmetric model could provide large rates for the lepton flavor violating processes if the scale of the supersymmetric masses is not far from the left-handed electroweak scale. The most promising mechanism in this respect is related with the higgsino particle, the superpartner of FCNC Higgs. The absence of direct phenomenological requirements for this fermion to be heavy makes the μ  →  eγ decay large, even without any flavor-changing insertions into the slepton line. The specific numerical predictions are weakened, however, by the lack of knowledge of explicit values for the supersymmetric masses. In particular, the predictive power of the model cannot be improved unless one specifies a way to solve the FCNC problem . If one believes that the masses of FCNC higgsinos are related to the vR scale and thus very large, one has to use another source of flavor violation coming from the Yukawa dependence of slepton masses. In this case LRSUSY is similar to MSSM at the usual electroweak scale and the right-handed scale plays the role of the intermediate scale considered in Ref. [\cite=deshp].

The mτ-proportionality of the amplitude for this process is very similar to the situation which occurs in unified theories [\cite=barbieri1] [\cite=barbieri2]. The similarity is not accidental. It is based on the presence of non-MSSM type slepton masses and mixings which survive in the effective low-energy theory even if the scale of the new physics, unification scale or vR, is very high. In LRSUSY, however, the mixing angles and masses in the lepton and quark sectors are not related. The rate of flavor-changing decay μ  →  eγ may be even bigger than in the unified theories. Therefore we conclude that at the current experimental accuracy the model already predicts nontrivial limits on mixing angles in the lepton sector.

In this letter we have concentrated only on mτ-proportional contributions to the amplitude of μ  →  eγ decay. A complete analysis would include the calculation of subleading mμ-proportional terms which could be important because the number of diagrams involved is very large. One would have to consider also the effects of the neutralino mixing, the differences between masses of superparticles, etc; all these are model-dependent. We believe, however, that the large degree of arbitrariness in the choice of various parameters in the model cannot change the main features of the muon decay amplitude considered here.
