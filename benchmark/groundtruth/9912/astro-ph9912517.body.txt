Constraints on Interstellar Plasma Turbulence Spectrum from Pulsar Observations at the Ooty Radio Telescope

Introduction

Refractive Interstellar Scintillation (RISS) effects on pulsar signals are powerful techniques for discriminating between different models that have been proposed for the power spectrum of plasma density fluctuations in the Interstellar Medium (ISM; e.g. Rickett 1990). The nature of the spectrum is considered to be a major input for understanding the underlying mechanism of interstellar plasma turbulence. Data from our long-term pulsar scintillation observations using the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) at 327 MHz are used to investigate the nature of the spectrum in the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM; region within ~   1 kpc of the Sun). Dynamic scintillation spectra were obtained for 18 pulsars in the DM range 3-  35 pc   ~   cm -  3  at ~  10-  100 epochs spanning ~  100-  1000 days during 1993-  1995 (Bhat et al. 1999). From these observations, various scintillation properties and the ISM parameters are estimated with accuracies much better than that which has been possible from most earlier data. The time series of parameters, viz., decorrelation bandwidth (νd ), scintillation time scale (τd ) and the drift slope of intensity scintillation patterns, and pulsar flux density are used to study various observable effects of Interstellar Scintillation, based on which the spectral form is inferred over the spatial scale range ~  107 m to [formula] m.

Results and Conclusions

The main results from the present study are:

Observations show large-amplitude modulations of the diffractive scintillation observables (νd  and τd ) and flux. The measured depths of modulations are considerably larger than the predictions of models based on a thin-screen scattering geometry and a simple Kolmogorov form of density spectrum.

The statistical properties of diffractive and refractive scattering angles are used to obtain precise estimates of the spectral slope (β) over the spatial scale range ~  107 m to ~  1011 m. While for 12 pulsars, β is found to be consistent with the Kolmogorov index (at   ±   2-σ levels), it is found to be significantly larger for 6 pulsars (11 / 3  <  β  <  4).

From the anomalous scintillation behaviour of persistent drift slopes lasting over many months, we infer the power levels at spatial scales ~  1012  -  1013 m (i.e., 1-  2 orders of magnitude larger than refractive scales) to be 2-  3 orders of magnitude larger than that expected from a Kolmogorov form of spectrum (Figure 1).

Although, there are various methods of investigating the nature of the spectrum, measurements based on a particular method give similar implications for the spectral form. A careful consideration of all the available results from the literature and our observations leads to the picture of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum (β  ≈  11 / 3) in the spatial scale range ~  106 m to ~  1011 m, with a low wavenumber enhancement (at κ  ~  10- 12  -  10- 13 m -  1 ). This is not quite in agreement with the results from some of the recent literature, where the spectrum is suggested to be an approximately power-law over the wide range ~  108 m to ~  1013 m (cf. Armstrong et al. 1995). Further, for several nearby pulsars (distance ~   200-  700 pc), the spectrum is found to be somewhat steeper (11 / 3  <  β  <  4), and there is a weak, systematic trend for a decrease in the spectral slope (β) with distance.
