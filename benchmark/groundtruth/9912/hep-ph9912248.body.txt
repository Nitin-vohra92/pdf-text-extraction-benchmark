DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTON STRUCTURE FUNCTION Fp2(x,Q2) IN THE FRAMEWORK OF EXTENDED REGGE - EIKONAL APPROACH

INTRODUCTION

In the literature one can find a number of models describing the behaviour of Fp2(x,Q2)in the framework of so called "soft" pomeron [\cite=models] or with help of "hard" pomeron [\cite=models1]. We add our arguments in favour of the "soft" pomeron by introducing a model taking into account unitarity for the processes with virtual particles. We outline some basic properties of the model that will help to distinguish it from the others.

OFF-SHELL EXTENTION OF THE REGGE-EIKONAL APPROACH

Construction of the model starts from the unitarity condition:

[formula]

(here [formula] is the scattering amplitude in the impact representation, [formula] is the impact parameter, [formula] stands for the contribution of inelastic channels) which in case of eikonal amplitude

[formula]

(here [formula] is the scattering amplitude, [formula] is the eikonal function), may be rewritten as

[formula]

We choose the following eikonal function in t-space (here t is transferred momentum)

[formula]

where

[formula]

is reffered to as"reggeon radius".

It means that the eikonal function has a simple pole in J plane and the corresponding Regge trajectory can be written in the following form:

[formula]

In order to rewrite functions in t- and b-spaces one uses Fourier-Bessel transformation:

[formula]

Making use of Eq. ([\ref=eq:fb]) we obtain the following b-representation of the eikonal function:

[formula]

We would like to emphasise that the "pomeron" in our model is the leading pole of the eikonal function.

For cross-sections we use the following normalizations:

[formula]

The off-shell extention of our approach can be resolved from the following consideration. T(s,t) can be rewritten in the following way:

[formula]

where (in case of identical particles of mass m)

[formula]

Eq.( [\ref=eq:expand]) can be symbolically represented by the following figure:

Now we can make a very important step. Let us give up some on-shell conditions, e.g. let's take q2  ≠  m2, q'2  ≠  m2 (i.e. two of the interacting particles are off-shell as for the process γ*p  →  γ*p). Then Eq.( [\ref=eq:expand]) takes the form:

[formula]

where the asterisks mean the number of off-shell momenta. Now we can rewrite the amplitude in the impact parameter space in the following way [\cite=petrov]:

[formula]

(it is evident that [formula] as far as [formula]Eq.( [\ref=eq:eikonalb]))

The expansion ( [\ref=eq:t**]) can be illustrated by the following figure:

The case when only one of the particles is off shell can be considered similarly. We assume now that q2  ≠  m2. Then Eq.( [\ref=eq:expand]) takes the form

[formula]

or we rewrite it as follows:

[formula]

Now let's choose concrete realizations of the eikonal functions in case of virtual particles. On the basis of Eq.( [\ref=eq:eikonalb]) we take the following parametrizations of off-shell eikonal functions:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

Coefficients c*(Q2), c*  *(Q2) are supposed to weakly (not in a powerlike way) depend on Q2. ξ± are signature coefficients. Now let's describe the properties of this model in different kinematic regions.

TOTAL CROSS-SECTION

In accordance with Eq.( [\ref=eq:norm]) we have:

[formula]

Regge Regime

[formula]

Bjorken Regime

[formula]

As we see the total cross-section posesses a powerlike behaviour in the Regge limit, but this is not a violation of unitarity, as the Froissart-Martin bound [\cite=fm] cannot be proven for this case and if we put all particles on the mass shell, then we restore the 'normal' logarifmic assymptotical behaviour [formula]. In the Bjorken limit we have strong (powerlike) violation of scaling in the second term which is not of higher-twist type because of non-integer power.

ELASTIC CROSS-SECTION

For the elastic cross section we have the following expression (Eq. [\ref=eq:norm]):

[formula]

As far as q'2  =  μ2, where μ is the mass of produced particle, it is natural to set s0  =  μ2 and now we can derive the following relations:

Regge Regime

[formula]

Bjorken Regime

[formula]

As we can easily realize

[formula]

Now we are ready to turn to describing the proton structure function Fp2(x,Q2)

THE MODEL FOR Fp2(x,Q2)

The proton structure function Fp2(x,Q2) can be connected to the transverse cross-section σ*  *T(W,Q2) of the γ*  +  p  →  X process by the following relation:

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]. As far as R(x,Q2) is deemed to be small, we let it be equal to 0 in what follows, i.e. we suppose that the total coss-section is the same as the transverse one.

In the following consideration we restrict ourselves within small x region (x < 10- 2) so that we would be able to use the asymptotic formula ( [\ref=eq:totalregge]) which explicitly gives us the effects of unitarization in our model. Using Eq. [\ref=eq:offshelleik**]and Eq. [\ref=eq:offshellrad*], Eq. [\ref=eq:totalregge] can be rewritten as ([formula])

[formula]

To derive this formula we have made the following assumptions:

We suppose that the amplitude for γ*p scattering is proportional [\cite=vectordominance] to the amplitude of virtual vector meson scattered on p and this "effective" vector meson is ρ0 with mass μ = 0.77 (GeV), i.e.

[formula]

where k is some constant.

As far as we are using the asymptotic formulas, we neglect the real part of the signature coefficient for pomeron (as far as this is proportional to ΔP≃0.1) and set the signature coefficient be i

The parametrizations of c*  * and c* are following:

[formula]

where Q20 = 1.0  (GeV2) and c*  *,  c*,  c*1 are parameters.

The radii ρ2,  ρ2* are parametrizied as follows:

[formula]

where r is a parameter.

Eventually we have the following expression for Fp2(x,Q2):

[formula]

RESULTS

As we have said, for the fit we used the data with x < 10- 2 and thus, from the whole set of 1265 data we extracted 401 experimental points. Having used 5 free parameters we achieved χ2 = 0.914. The fitted parameters are given in Table [\ref=tab:1] (The intercept and the slope of the pomeron is derived from the fit of nucleon-nucleon cross-sections in [\cite=Prokudin]).

The results of fitting are presented in Figures ( [\ref=fig:f2]) and ( [\ref=fig:f21])

x-SLOPE OR ∂lnFp2(x,Q2)  /  ∂ln(1  /  x)

The data on F22(x,Q2) show a tendency of fast growth with decrease of x. This is so-called HERA effect. Our model suggests that this effect will ease down with increase of Q2. This can be seen in Figure [\ref=fig:x]. The same effect is predicted in the Dipole pomeron model [\cite=Martynov]. We believe that new experimental observations in the kinematic region of 100  ≤  Q2  ≤  1000 and x  ≤  10- 2 will help to verify existence of this phenomenon.

The effective intercept, which is mesaured by experimentalists assuming that [formula] can be approximately identified with the x-slope if the slope depends weakly on x. We performed calculation of the slope and the comparison with the experimental data is in the Figure [\ref=fig:xexp]. As is seen the experimental results are well described by the model.

Q-SLOPE OR ∂Fp2(x,Q2)  /  ∂ln(Q2)

The data on the Q-slope shows a peak at Q2  ~  1 - 5  GeV2. This peak is interpreted as a transition from Regge behaviour to a perturbative QCD regime. We performed calculation in the framework of our model and the result is in Figure. [\ref=fig:q]. As is seen, there is no contradiction in the behaviour of the Q-slope and Regge regime. We also want to emphasise that the determination of the transition region depends on the path on the two-dimentional surface of ∂Fp2(x,Q2)  /  ∂ln(Q2) and it may lead to the x-dependence of the position of the peak [\cite=Martynov]. To demonstrate this we show this surface calculated in our model in Figure [\ref=fig:qexp].

CONCLUSION

The proton structure function Fp2(x,Q2) is described in the framework of extended Regge-eikonal approach. It is argued that for this one does not need additional Regge poles with intercepts depending on Q2. The experimental data on x- and Q-slope are also described fairly well. The model predicts damping of the HERA effect (the similar prediction is made in the framework of the Dipole pomeron model [\cite=Martynov]).
