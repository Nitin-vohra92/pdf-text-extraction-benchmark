Low frequency catalogues of the CATS database

The creation of the CATS database (http://cats.sao.ru) was motivated on the one hand by the measurements of radio continuum spectra with the RATAN-600 telescope (by two of us, O.V. and S.T.), and, on the other hand, by the activity of the third author (H.A.) in collecting the astrophysical catalogues. CATS became operational in 1996.

The main objective of the CATS database is to help a user to operate with a large number of astrophysical catalogues which have been published in different formats, each one including a somewhat different set of observational parameters.

Among the options accessible to CATS users we mention

Request short descriptions of each catalogue, or print a list of catalogues covering the required sky areas.

Select objects from one or more catalogues by coordinate, flux, spectral index, frequency, etc.

Select objects from one or more catalogues for many sky patches defined by position and size (e.g. for cross-ID with other catalogues).

Display radio spectra of selected sources.

Among other applications, CATS may be used for object identification, source counts in different wavelength ranges, or the study of statistical properties of different source populations. Standard access to CATS is via WWW at http://cats.sao.ru), or e-mail (cats@sao.ru), or anon. FTP. Batch requests to extract objects from large lists of sky regions are supported via e-mail. Standard formats of input and output of CATS are discussed, and some optimized ways of interaction with CATS are shown.

Our database comprises more than 300 catalogues. At present, 140 of these catalogues include data at frequencies less or equal 1400 MHz. The largest or the most important of them are all the Cambridge catalogues from 3C to 8C (38, 151, 178, 408 MHz), the VLA FIRST and NVSS catalogues at 1400 MHz, the 2nd and 3rd Bologna surveys at 408 MHz, the Westerbork catalogues at 325 MHz, the Texas catalogue at 365 MHz, the Parkes catalogues at several frequencies, the GB catalogues, the RATAN-600 catalogues. There are further dedicated catalogues of radio sources, like e.g. those in clusters of galaxies, by Slee, Owen or Reynolds. The CATS database includes a large number of Galactic radio sources, supernova remnants and their maps, observed with the RATAN-600, Bonn, Ooty, VLA and other telescopes.

Several basic catalogues at low frequencies are given in Table, containing the main survey parameters. This table also includes catalogus obtained at high radio frequencies, at other wavelength ranges and several mixed catalogues.

The standard access to the CATS database is provided in three different ways:

http://cats.sao.ru

e-mail: cats@sao.ru (an empty email delivers a help file)

ftp://cats.sao.ru (anonymous FTP)

HTTP and e-mail access permits the user to obtain informtaion from catalogues in selected areas, and to search for cross-identifications of entries in CATS with user-specified input lists.

Here are some simple examples of e-mail requests which are very convenient for a slow network transfer:

Search an area defined by limits in equatorial coordinates for objects drawn from all radio catalogues, with a flux density higher than 500 mJy:

mail cats@sao.ru cats select ra min=12:30 max=12:40:15. dec >   0 <   5' 46" catalogs r epoch=1950 flux >   500 cats end

Request letter for the coordinate cross-identification of 3 sources in all the CATS catalogs with errors by x (RA) and y (DEC): mail cats@sao.ru cats match catalogs a window box x=60" y=2' sources: s1 02:02:00    +31:23:16    1950 s2 02:23:10     00:03:00    1950 s3 21:26:33.9  -18:34:33.0  1950 cats end
