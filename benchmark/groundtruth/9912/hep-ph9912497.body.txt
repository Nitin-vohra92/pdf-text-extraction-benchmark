New Physics and Short-Distance   s  →  dγ   Transition in   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   Decay

Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011

Introduction

Recent theoretical studies have shown that the decay   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   may be the leading candidate among weak radiative hyperon decays for providing a window to the short-distance   s  →  dγ   transition [\cite=singer]. The standard-model contribution to this short-distance transition in   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   has been estimated to be smaller than long-distance contributions to the decay, but probably not significantly so [\cite=KogShi] [\cite=EilIMS] [\cite=NieBER]. In order to separate the various contributions to the decay, it may be necessary to study both its branching ratio and its asymmetry parameter [\cite=RafSin] [\cite=EilIS], but the only experimental information currently available is the upper limit [\cite=pdb] [formula]

In the absence of better data, one can take the position that the short-distance   s  →  dγ   contribution to   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay is not negligible compared to other contributions. In that case, the decay can also provide a window to new physics beyond the standard model, to the extent that the effects of new physics are not too small.

The short-distance   s  →  dγ   transition is the second-generation analogue of the decay mode   b  →  sγ,   which has been used to place constraints on physics beyond the standard model [\cite=bsg1]. The mode is particularly useful for constraining new interactions which remove the chirality suppression that occurs in the standard model. In this case, the amplitude is enhanced by factors of a heavy-mass scale relative to the b-quark mass. The same type of new physics enhances the   s  →  dγ   transition by a factor of a heavy-mass scale relative to the s-quark mass. In models in which the enhancement is as large as one can expect on dimensional grounds, it is possible to place interesting constraints from   s  →  dγ   on the new interactions, especially when the decay modes involved are not significantly dominated by long-distance physics.

In this paper, we would like to explore this possibility in   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay and consider two types of models in which the short-distance transition can be significantly enhanced with respect to the standard model (SM). This study will be complementary to studies on new-physics contributions to   s  →  dγ   in kaon and other hyperon decays [\cite=dsg]. In Ref. [\cite=RosBEN], the impact of new interactions on   s  →  dγ   in   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   was also investigated, but the models considered there did not remove the chirality suppression occurring in the SM, resulting in negligible new contributions.

In the next section, we introduce our notation for the effective interaction responsible for the short-distance   s  →  dγ   transition. In order to describe the effect of this transition on   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay, we shall use a chiral-Lagrangian analysis. In the following two sections, we consider contributions of new physics to   s  →  dγ   in left-right symmetric models [\cite=mohapatra] [\cite=FujYam] [\cite=bsg2] and in generic supersymmetric models [\cite=GabGMS]. We are not here interested in the specific details of the models, and so we will consider only the effective low-energy operators that the models may generate. The last section contains our conclusions.

Short-distance   s  →  dγ   operator in   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay

The effective Hamiltonian responsible for the short-distance   s  →  dγ,dg   transitions can be written, following the notation of Ref. [\cite=BurCIRS], as

[formula]

where C±γ,g are the Wilson coefficients and

[formula]

are the so-called electromagnetic- and chromomagnetic-dipole operators, respectively, with [formula] being the d-quark charge and Fμν [formula] being the photon (gluon) field-strength tensor. We notice that Q±γ transform as [formula] under chiral rotations, and so Q+γ [formula] is even (odd) under parity. C±γ,g contain standard-model and possible new-physics contributions.

To evaluate the contribution of the   s  →  dγ   operators in Eq. ([\ref=H_eff]) to   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay, one needs to calculate [formula] being sandwiched between hadronic states. Unfortunately, there is presently no reliable way to compute these matrix elements. For this reason, we will estimate the impact of the operators by employing a chiral-Lagrangian approach combined with naive dimensional-analysis [\cite=nda].

The chiral Lagrangian that describes   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   is written down in terms of a [formula] matrix B containing the baryon-octet fields, a Rarita-Schwinger tensor Tμabc representing the decuplet baryons, and field-strength tensors [formula] and [formula], where [formula] with   Q = diag(2, - 1, - 1) / 3   being the quark-charge matrix. Also included is the exponential [formula] where φ is the usual [formula] matrix containing the octet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons and [formula] is the pion-decay constant. (The notation here for hadronic fields follows that of Ref. [\cite=AbdTV].) Under chiral rotations, [formula] [formula] [formula] and [formula] where [formula] and U is implicitly defined by the transformation [formula]

There are many possible chiral realizations of the   s  →  dγ   operators in [formula]. As an example at lowest order, we write down

[formula]

where [formula] selects out   s  →  dγ   transitions, the terms proportional to the constants [formula] have the chiral-transformation properties of Q±γ, and we have included only terms contributing to   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ.   Using naive dimensional-analysis [\cite=nda], we obtain the order-of-magnitude estimate

[formula]

The most general, gauge-invariant form of the amplitude for [formula] can be written as [\cite=RafSin]

[formula]

where [formula] is the Fermi constant, the u's are baryon spinors, and [formula] are constants to be determined from the Lagrangian. The corresponding decay width is given by [\cite=RafSin]

[formula]

Then, from the Lagrangian in Eq. ([\ref=L_(TBg)]), we derive

[formula]

leading to a branching ratio

[formula]

In the SM, the Wilson coefficients at the one-loop level without QCD corrections are given by [\cite=InaLim] [\cite=BerFG]

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

Although C±γ,SM(μ) are very small at [formula] they receive large QCD corrections at   μ  ~  1  GeV,   mostly due to the mixing of Q±γ with the four-quark operator [formula] [\cite=BerFG] [\cite=ShiVZ] [\cite=BucBL]. For our numerical estimates, we will use [formula] the middle values of the quark masses in Ref. [\cite=pdb], and the CKM-matrix elements in the Wolfenstein parameterization with   λ = 0.22,   A = 0.82,   ρ = 0.16   and   η = 0.38   from Ref. [\cite=mele]. At   μ = 1  GeV,   we find

[formula]

where we have neglected the small imaginary parts. Employing these numbers in Eq. ([\ref=br]), we obtain for the short-distance contribution

[formula]

which is within the range of previous estimates using other methods [\cite=EilIMS] [\cite=NieBER].

Left-right symmetric models

One of the popular extensions of the SM is the left-right symmetric model [\cite=mohapatra], which incorporates the mixing of left- and right-handed W bosons. Variations of this model have been studied in the context of   b  →  sγ   in detail [\cite=FujYam] [\cite=bsg2], where an enhancement by a factor of [formula] occurring in this process has led to constraints on the right-handed tbW coupling. Similar interactions can occur in   s  →  dγ,   which replace the suppression due to light-quark mass in [formula] with an enhancement from a heavy-quark mass.

For our purposes, it suffices to deal with the effective Lagrangian that results after integrating out the heavy right-handed W at the scale of the standard-W mass. This can be done easily by following the formalism of Ref. [\cite=PecZha]. In the unitary gauge, the new interaction can be written as

[formula]

where ṽ is a [formula] unitary matrix having elements [formula] with [formula] being CKM-matrix elements and κRqq' real numbers. In writing [formula] above, we have assumed C P invariance and neglected modifications to the left-handed W-couplings which do not lead to enhanced effects.

The interaction [formula] has previously been considered in a   b  →  sγ   study [\cite=FujYam] and in a study of C P violation in B decays [\cite=AbdVal]. Generalizing those results, we can derive the Wilson coefficients

[formula]

where

[formula]

At a hadronic-mass scale   μ  ~  1  GeV,   the coefficients of the electromagnetic-dipole operators generated by the new couplings are [\cite=running]

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is the number of active quarks. We then have at   μ = 1  GeV

[formula]

If all the κR parameters are of the same order of magnitude, then the c-quark contribution will be dominant. It has been found in Ref. [\cite=FujYam] that   b  →  sγ   constrains κRtb to be at most a few percent. We can, therefore, reasonably assume that other κR's have similar upper-bounds. Thus, taking   κRcs = 0.02   and   κRcd = 0,   and neglecting contributions from u and t quarks, we find

[formula]

which is comparable to the SM values in Eq. ([\ref=csm]). This order-of-magnitude estimate of C±γ,RH suggests that it is possible for left-right symmetric models to generate contributions to   s  →  dγ   which exceed that of the SM.

Supersymmetric models

Another popular scenario for new physics in which the coefficients [formula] can be naturally large is the general supersymmetric extension of the SM. In this class of models, one can generate the   s  →  dγ   operators at one-loop via intermediate squarks and gluinos. The enhancement is due both to the strong coupling constant and to the removal of chirality suppression that results in an enhancement factor of a gluino mass relative to a light-quark mass. In order to avoid specific models, we follow Ref. [\cite=GabGMS] to work in the so-called mass-insertion approximation.

If SUSY particles are integrated out at the scale [formula] where [formula] is the average gluino-mass, then at   μ = 1  GeV   the Wilson coefficients arising from the new physics are

[formula]

where

[formula]

The full expressions for [formula] can be found in Ref. [\cite=GabGMS]. We are interested here only in the terms proportional to [formula], which may give potentially large contributions to   sd(γ,g)   couplings and are given by [\cite=BurCIRS]

[formula]

where the δ's are the parameters of the mass-insertion formalism, [formula] with [formula] being the average squark-mass, and

[formula]

Numerically, we obtain, for [formula]

[formula]

It has been shown in Refs. [\cite=GabGMS] [\cite=MasMur] that the real part of [formula] is constrained from [formula] to be typically less than 10- 2, and that its imaginary part is expected from ε' / ε to be less than a few times 10- 5. Using the upper bounds of [formula] from Ref. [\cite=MasMur] and choosing [formula] we find

[formula]

These limits exceed the SM values in Eq. ([\ref=csm]) by up to several times. The resulting branching ratio can be as large as

[formula]

which is about an order of magnitude below the experimental limit.

In view of the potentially large values of [formula], we should consider how they might affect the decay   Ξ-  →  Σ-γ,   which has a measured branching-ratio of   (1.27  ±  0.23)  ×  10- 4.   This is because both   Ξ-  →  Σ-γ   and   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   proceed by the same mechanisms at the quark level, due to the valence-quark content of the baryons involved [\cite=singer] [\cite=GilWis]. To estimate the impact of the short-distance   s  →  dγ   operators on   Ξ-  →  Σ-γ,   we again employ a chiral-Lagrangian analysis. Thus, we can construct

[formula]

where [formula] As a result, we find that supersymmetric models can yield contributions to the branching ratio as much as [formula] This is still consistent with the expectation that the decay is dominated by long-distance physics [\cite=singer] [\cite=KogShi] [\cite=EilIMS] [\cite=singer2].

Conclusions

We have investigated the effects of new physics beyond the standard model on the short-distance   s  →  dγ   transition in   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay. We have considered the possibility that the new interactions do not generate the chirality suppression occurring in the standard-model contribution to   s  →  dγ,   thereby increasing the effect of the coupling by factors of a heavy-mass scale relative to the s-quark mass. We have looked at contributions from two popular classes of models for new physics, left-right symmetric models and generic supersymmetric models. After taking the constraints from   b  →  sγ   and kaon processes into account, we have found that contributions from the new interactions can be larger than that of the standard model by up to several times. The resulting effect on the branching ratio of   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   can be as large as an order of magnitude below the current experimental bound, which suggests that   Ω-  →  Ξ-γ   decay can be used to search for new physics or place constraints on it. This should encourage serious efforts to measure the decay.
