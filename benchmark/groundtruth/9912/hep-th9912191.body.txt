ABSTRACT

Using AdS/CFT correspondence we found the conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged supergravity with single scalar (dilaton) and the arbitrary scalar potential on AdS-like scalar-gravitational background. Such dilatonic gravity action describes the special RG flows in extended gauged SG when scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of complete scalars space. This dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly corresponds to dual non-conformal (gauge) QFT (which is classically conformally invariant) with account of radiative corrections. Equations of motion in d5 gauged supergravity put some restrictions to the dilatonic potential on the conformal boundary. Using these restrictions we propose the candidate c-functions away from exact conformity. These c-functions are positively defined and monotonic, expressed in terms of dilatonic potential and have the fixed points in asymptotically AdS region.

Five-dimensional gauged supergravity (SG) plays an important role in AdS/CFT correspondence[\cite=AdS]. It is known that different versions of d5 gauged SG (for example, N = 8 d5 gauged SG[\cite=GRW] with fourty-two scalars and non-trivial scalar potential) may appear as a result of truncation of d10 IIB SG. In particular, AdS5  ×  S5 deformed truncation of IIB SG (with non-trivial scalars) corresponds to some specific solution of d5 gauged SG. Hence, it is often enough to study 5d gauged SG classical solutions in AdS/CFT set-up instead of the investigation of non-linear IIB SG solutions. Such (deformed) solutions describe RG flows in dual boundary field theory (for a very recent discussion of such flows, see [\cite=GPPZ] [\cite=CM] [\cite=DF] and refs. therein). It is very interesting that even 4d curvature or non-zero temperature effects may be taken into account in bulk description of such RG flows [\cite=NOR]. In consideration of extended d5 gauged SG solutions there are often more symmetric (special) RG flows where scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of complete scalars space. (Then such theory corresponds to d5 dilatonic gravity with non-trivial dilaton potential). Such flows may also correspond to certain (D3)-brane distributions [\cite=FGPW]. However, note that it is extremely difficult to make the explicit identification of deformed gauged SG solution with the corresponding non-conformal dual gauge theory.

The important characteristic of boundary (gauge) theory in AdS/CFT correspondence is the conformal anomaly which may be found from the bulk side (see paper by Witten in ref.[\cite=AdS]). The calculation of conformal anomaly in d5 gauged SG with single scalar and constant scalar potential (dilatonic gravity) on dilaton-gravitational background via AdS/CFT correspondence has been initiated in ref.[\cite=NOano]. It was shown that N = 4 super YM theory covariantly coupled with N = 4 conformal SG [\cite=peter] is actual dual of d5 dilatonic gravity (see also derivation of anomaly in gravity-complex scalar background in refs.[\cite=LT] [\cite=NOOSY]). From holographic RG description (see refs.[\cite=BK] [\cite=VV] for introduction) it is known that dilaton (or in more general case, scalars) describe the couplings of dual (gauge) theory, say, masses, scalars or coupling constants. Hence, it is extremely interesting to get the conformal anomaly from gauged SG with non-trivial scalar potential. This may give much better understanding of RG flows in dual (non-conformal exactly) boundary theory and also the definition of analog of central charge (c-function) away of exact conformity. Even more, considering the conformal anomaly (up to some loop) of dual general boundary theory with radiative corrections and comparing it with the one from bulk gauged SG may help in correct identification of dual boundary theory with correspondent bulk identification (which is currently non-easy task). Note also that conformal anomaly plays an important role in the construction of local surface counterterm for gauged SGs with non-constant scalar potential [\cite=CO].

In the present letter we find the AdS/CFT conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged SG with single scalar (dilaton) and arbitrary dilaton potential. This situation corresponds to special RG flow in dual description. The acceptable candidates for analogs of central charge (or more exactly, of c-function) away of exact conformity are proposed when equations of motion are partly used. The monotonity and positivity of c-functions is shown, they have standard fixed points in asymptotically AdS region.

We start with the bulk action of d + 1-dimensional dilatonic gravity with the potential Φ

[formula]

Here Md + 1 is d + 1 dimensional manifold whose boundary is the d dimensional manifold Md and we choose Φ(0) = 0. Such action corresponds to (bosonic sector) of gauged SG with single scalar (special RG flow). Note also that classical vacuum stability restricts the form of dilaton potential [\cite=T]. As well-known, we also need to add the surface terms [\cite=3] to the bulk action in order that the variational principle to be well-defined. We should only note here that the surface terms become irrelevant finally in the calculation for the Weyl anomaly given in this work. The equations of motion given by variation of ([\ref=i]) with respect to φ and Gμν are

[formula]

Here [formula].

We choose the metric Ĝμν on Md + 1 and the metric ĝμν on Md in the following form

[formula]

Here l is related with λ2 by 4λ2  =  d(d - 1) / l2. If gij  =  ηij, the boundary of AdS lies at ρ = 0. Note that we follow the method of calculation in refs.[\cite=NOano] [\cite=NOOSY] where dilatonic gravity with constant dilaton potential has been considered.

The action ([\ref=i]) diverges in general since the action contains the infinite volume integration on Md + 1. The action is regularized by introducing the infrared cutoff ε and replacing

[formula]

We also expand gij and φ with respect to ρ:

[formula]

Then the action is also expanded as a power series on ρ. The subtraction of the terms proportional to the inverse power of ε does not break the invariance under the scale transformation δgμν = 2δσgμν and δε = 2δσε . When d is even, however, the term proportional to ln ε appears. This term is not invariant under the scale transformation and the subtraction of the ln ε term breaks the invariance. The variation of the ln ε term under the scale transformation is finite when ε  →  0 and should be canceled by the variation of the finite term (which does not depend on ε) in the action since the original action ([\ref=i]) is invariant under the scale transformation. Therefore the ln ε term S ln gives the Weyl anomaly T of the action renormalized by the subtraction of the terms which diverge when ε  →  0 (d=4)

[formula]

First we consider the case of d = 2, i.e. three-dimensional gauged SG. The anomaly term S ln proportional to  lnε in the action is

[formula]

The terms propotional to ρ0 with μ,ν = i,j in ([\ref=iii]) lead to g(1)ij in terms of g(0)ij and φ(1).

[formula]

In the equation ([\ref=ii]), the terms propotional to ρ- 1 lead to φ(1) as follows:

[formula]

Then anomaly term takes the following form using ([\ref=vi]), ([\ref=vii])

[formula]

For Φ(φ) = 0 case, the central charge of the conformal field theory is given by the coefficient of R. Then it might be natural to introduce the analog of central charge c, i.e. c-function for the case when the conformal symmetry is broken by the deformation as follows :

[formula]

Comparing this with radiatively-corrected c-function of boundary QFT may help in correct bulk description of such theory. If candidate c-function is getting non-monotonic in some region that indicates to breaking of SG description there.

We now consider the case of d = 4. The anomaly terms which proportional to  ln ε are

[formula]

The terms proportional to ρ0 with μ,ν = i,j in the equation of the motion ([\ref=iii]) lead to g(1)ij in terms of g(0)ij and φ(1).

[formula]

In the equation ([\ref=ii]), the terms proportional to ρ- 2 lead to φ(1) as follows:

[formula]

In the equation ([\ref=iii]), the terms proportional to ρ1 with μ,ν = i,j lead to g(2)ij.

[formula]

And the terms proportional to ρ- 1 in the equation ([\ref=ii]), lead to φ(2) as follows:

[formula]

Then we can get the anomaly terms ([\ref=ano]) in terms of g(0)ij and φ(0), which are boundary values of metric and dilaton respectively by using ([\ref=vibb]), ([\ref=vii4d]), ([\ref=viii]), ([\ref=phi2]). As we are only interested in c-function away from conformity, we present the coefficients of R2(0) and R(0)ijRij(0), which appear in Weyl anomaly ([\ref=ano2]). For this reason, we neglect the terms containing the derivative with respect to xi. Here we choose l = 1 and denote Φ(φ(0)) by Φ and abbreviate the index (0) for the simplicity.

Then substituting ([\ref=vii4d]) into ([\ref=vibb]), we obtain

[formula]

Here [formula] expresses the terms containing the derivative with respect to xi. Further, substituting ([\ref=vii4d]) and ([\ref=S1]) into ([\ref=phi2]), we obtain φ(2) in terms of g(0)ij and φ(0). Substituting ([\ref=vii4d]), ([\ref=S1]) and the obtained expression of φ(2) into ([\ref=viii]), one gets the expression of gijg(2)ij. Finally substituting the obtained expressions into the expression for the anomaly ([\ref=ano]), we obtain,

[formula]

Here [formula] expresses the terms containing the derivative with respect to xi. In case of the dilaton gravity in [\cite=NOano] corresponding to Φ = 0 (or more generally in case that the axion is included as in [\cite=NOOSY]), we have the following expression:

[formula]

Here φ can be regarded as dilaton. When Φ is not trivial, of course, there appear extra terms which are denoted by [formula] in ([\ref=AN1]). When Φ is not trivial, for example, the coefficient of [formula] becomes dilaton dependent. And there would appear the terms like R(0)gij(0)∂iφ(0)∂jφ(0) and Rij(0)∂iφ(0)∂jφ(0) and their dilaton dependent coefficients are quite complicated.

We should also note that the expression ([\ref=AN1]) cannot be rewritten as a sum of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant [formula] and the square of the Weyl tensor F, which are

[formula]

This is the signal that the conformal symmetry is broken. In the limit of Φ  →  0, we obtain

[formula]

and we can find that the standard result (conformal anomaly of N = 4 super YM theory) is reproduced. In order that the region near the boundary at ρ = 0 is asymptotically AdS, we need to require Φ  →  0 and Φ'  →  0 when ρ  →  0. We can also confirm that [formula] and [formula] in the limit of Φ  →  0 and Φ'  →  0 even if Φ''  ≠  0 and Φ'''  ≠  0. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, k and h should be related with the central charge c of the conformal field theory (or its analog for non-conformal theory). Since we have two functions h and k, there are two natural ways to define the c-function when the conformal field theory is deformed:

[formula]

Note that above can be considered as auxiliar consequence of the found conformal anomaly. If we put V(φ) = 4λ2  +  Φ(φ), we have [formula]. We should note that we have chosen l = 1 in the expressions in ([\ref=CC]). We can restore l-dependence by changing h  →  l3h and k  →  l3k and Φ'  →  lΦ', Φ''  →  l2Φ'' and Φ'''  →  l3Φ''' in ([\ref=AN1]). Then in the limit of Φ  →  0, we obtain

[formula]

which agrees with the definition used in the works [\cite=GPPZ2] [\cite=FGPW2] (where equations of motion were actually used) in above limit. The c1- or c2-functions in ([\ref=CC]) give the new candidate for c-function away of conformity.

The definitions of the c-functions in ([\ref=d2c]) and ([\ref=CC]), are, however, not always good ones since our results are too wide. That is, we have obtained the conformal anomaly for arbitrary dilatonic background which may not be the solution of original d = 5 gauged supergravity. As only solutions of d5 gauged supergravity describe RG flows of dual QFT it is not strange that above candidate c-functions are not acceptable. They quickly become non-monotonic and even singular in explicit examples. In such situation (taking into account the construction method) they presumbly measure the deviations from SG description and should not be taken seriously. As pointed in [\cite=MTR], it might be necessary to impose the condition Φ' = 0 on the boundary which follows from the equations of motion of d5 gauged SG. Anyway as Φ' = 0 on the boundary in the solution which has the asymptotic AdS region, we can add any function which proportional to the power of Φ' = 0 to the previous expressions of the c-functions in ([\ref=d2c]) and ([\ref=CC]). As a trial, if we put Φ' = 0, we obtain

[formula]

instead of ([\ref=d2c]) and

[formula]

instead of ([\ref=CC]). We should note that there disappear the higher derivative terms like Φ'' or Φ'''. That will be our final proposal for acceptable c-function in terms of dilatonic potential. The given c-functions in ([\ref=CCb]) also have the property ([\ref=CCl]) and reproduce the known result for the central charge on the boundary. Since Φ'  →  0 in the asymptotically AdS region even if the region is UV or IR, the given c-functions in ([\ref=d2cb]) and ([\ref=CCb]) have fixed points in the asymptotic AdS region [formula], where [formula] is the radius coordinate in AdS or the energy scale of the boundary field theory.

We can now check the monotonity in the c-functions. For this purpose, we consider some examples. In [\cite=FGPW] and [\cite=GPPZ], the following dilaton potentials appeared:

[formula]

In both cases V is a constant and V =  - 2. In the classical solutions for the both cases, φ is the monotonically decreasing function of the energy scale [formula] and φ = 0 at the UV limit corresponding to the boundary. Then in order to know the energy scale dependences of c1 and c2, we only need to investigate the φ dependences of c1 and c2 in ([\ref=CCb]). As the potentials and also Φ have a minimum Φ = 0 at φ = 0, which corresponds to the UV boundary in the solutions in [\cite=FGPW] and [\cite=GPPZ], and Φ is monotonicaly increasing function of the absolute value |φ|, we only need to check the monotonities of c1 and c2 with respect to Φ when Φ  ≥  0. From ([\ref=CCb]), we find

[formula]

Therefore the c-functions c1 and c2 are monotonically decreasing function of Φ or increasing function of the energy scale U as the c-function in [\cite=DF] [\cite=GPPZ]. We should also note that the c-functions c1 and c2 are positive definite for non-negative Φ. For c in ([\ref=d2cb]) for d = 2 case, it is very straightforward to check the monotonity and the positivity.

In [\cite=GPPZ2], another c-function has been proposed in terms of the metric as follows:

[formula]

where the metric is given by

[formula]

The c-function ([\ref=gppzC]) is positive and has a fixed point in the asymptotically AdS region again and the c-function is also monotonically decreasing function of the energy scale. The c-functions ([\ref=d2cb]) and ([\ref=CCb]) proposed in this paper are given in terms of the dilaton potential, not in terms of metric, but it might be interesting that the c-functions in ([\ref=d2cb]) and ([\ref=CCb]) have the similar properties (positivity, monotonity and fixed point in the asymptotically AdS region).

In summary, we found the conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged supergravity with single scalar and arbitrary scalar potential on the scalar-gravitational background. It corresponds to the conformal anomaly of dual boundary theory. The proposal to define c-function which is positively definite and monotonically decreasing and defined in terms of dilatonic potential is given. Our work may be extended for d5 gauged SG with bigger number of scalars (say N = 8 gauged SG) and arbitrary scalar potential. The final result appears in really complicated and lengthy form as it will be shown in another place. This opens the possibility of explicit check if the results on RG flows in dual gauge theory (deformed N = 4 super Yang-Mills) presented in refs.[\cite=DF] [\cite=GPPZ] from bulk side indeed describe 4d gauge Yang-Mills theory with lesser supersymmetry and the correspondent identification is correct. From another side, our conformal anomaly in the spirit of ref.[\cite=myers] may be used to calculate the Casimir energy in dilatonic gravity. As the final remark let us note that dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly found in this work may be used for calculation of anomaly induced effective action of non-conformal boundary QFT in the presence of scalars (see ref.[\cite=brevik] for related example of dilaton dependent induced effective action in SUSY Yang-Mills theory).
