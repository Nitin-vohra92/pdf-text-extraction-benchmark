Introduction

A major target experiment at the CERN e+e- collider LEPII ([formula] GeV) is undoubtedly W-boson pair productions. It should thus be possible to examine electroweak (EW) theories quantitatively. The process[\cite=eeww] e+e-  →  W+W- allows us not only to determine various properties of the W boson,but to measure the trilinear couplings[\cite=vww] VW+W- (V = Z0,γ). Another boson pair production process e+e-  →  Z0Z0 is physically less important than the W-pair and Zγ pair production because of smaller cross section but it has to be studied in order to provide a crucial background for high mass Higgs searches[\cite=higgs]. It is still an important test for the standard model (SM) to examine trilinear couplings.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility that there could be significant changes in the behavior of the process e+e-  →  W+W- and Z0Z0 in terms of the total cross sections σ(s) for [formula] GeV, leading to considerable deviations from the SM result if a new neutral gauge boson ([formula]) and a new charged gauge boson ([formula]) such as the ones in the [formula] model were present. There are a number of authors who have investigated this problem within models with only one extra neutral gauge boson[\cite=extraz]. In fact, two of us (T. K and G. P) presented in a previous paper a similar work on e+e-  →  W+W- where the contribution from [formula] was neglected for simplicity in the analysis. Inclusion of the [formula] turns out to enhance the deviation considerably, as we will show in this paper.

The standard model (SM) has been spectacularly successful in describing the data that are available from recent experiments[\cite=1inUV]. The agreements between theory and experiments include not just tree-level results, but also radiative corrections. Nevertheless, there are still a few places where room for new physics exists. Further, from the theoretical point of view, there is a consensus that the SM can only be the low energy limit of a more complete theory. Extensions of the SM usually add extra gauge bosons, or extra fermions, or both, to the known particle spectrum. In this paper we consider the [formula] family model, in which there is a larger flavor gauge group with additional gauge bosons, keeping the fermion spectrum intact.

The [formula] model, proposed some time ago[\cite=kuo-nakagawa], is the simplest extension of the standard model of three generations that unifies the standard SU(2)L with the horizontal gauge group GH( = SU(3)H) into an anomaly free, simple, Lie group. In this model, the six left-handed quarks (or leptons) belong to a 6 of SP(6)L, while the right-handed fermions are all singlets. It is thus a straightforward generalization of SU(2)L into SP(6)L, with the three doublets of SU(2)L coalescing into a sextet of SP(6)L. Most of the new gauge bosons are arranged to be heavy (  ≥  102-103  TeV) so as to avoid sizable FCNC. SP(6)L can be naturally broken into SU(2)L through a chain of symmetry breakings. The breakdown SP(6)L  →  [SU(2)]3  →  SU(2)L can be induced by two antisymmetric Higgs which transform as [formula] under [formula]. The standard SU(2)L is to be identified with the diagonal SU(2) subgroup of [formula], where SU(2)i operates on the ith generation exclusively. In terms of the SU(2)i gauge boson [formula], the SU(2)L gauge bosons are given by [formula]. Of the other orthogonal combinations of [formula], [formula], which exhibits unversality only among the first two generations, can have a mass scale in the TeV range [\cite=1TeVZ]. The three gauge bosons [formula] will be denoted as [formula] and [formula].

The [formula] family model and the cross sections

We now turn to a detailed analysis of the effects of the extra bosons from [formula] model. The dominant effects of new heavier gauge boson [formula] show up in its mixing with the standard Z(W±) to form the mass eigenstates Z1,2(W1,2):

[formula]

where Z1(W1) is identified with the physical Z(W).

With the additional gauge boson [formula], the neutral-current Lagrangian is generalized to contain an additional term

[formula]

where [formula], xW  =   sin 2θW, and [formula]. The neutral currents JZ and [formula] are given by

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] as in SM, [formula] for the first two generations and [formula] for the third. Here [formula] and qf are the third component of weak isospin and electric charge of fermion f, respectively. And the neutral-current Lagrangian reads in terms of Z1,2

[formula]

where gfVi and gfAi are the vector and axial-vector couplings of fermion f to physical gauge boson Zi, respectively. They are given by

[formula]

Similar analysis can be carried out in the charged sector.

In order to see visible effects of the presence of [formula] and [formula], the mixing angles φZ and φW should not be too small. According to an analysis[\cite=tests] using the latest LEP data the present constraint on the mixing angles is |φZ|, |φZ|  ≤  0.01 . This constraint will be used in choosing the mixing angles in the following analysis.

Let's first consider the process e+e-  →  W+1W-1

[formula]

Neglecting the electron mass for high energies, only two initial helicity configurations Δσ  =  σ-  -  σ+  =    ±  1 are allowed. All polarized differential cross sections are given by

[formula]

where θ is the angle between the e- and the W-1 momenta, k-  =  (E-,k sin θ,0,k cos θ), [formula] and

[formula]

where Δλ  =  λ-  -  λ+, J0  =  max(|Δσ|,|Δλ|), dJ0Δσ,Δλ(θ) being an ordinary Wigner function, and

[formula]

where

[formula]

with [formula], [formula]. Similarly, for the process e+e-  →  Z01Z01,

[formula]

where XΔσ =  - 1 = (A1Le)2 and XΔσ =  + 1 = (A1Re)2. For brevity we omit the explicit expressions for Mt,Mu,and Ms which are t-, u- and s- channel amplitudes, respectively. Using the above formulas and sin 2θW  =  0.23 , MZ1 = 91.17 GeV, MW1 = 80.11 GeV, ΓZ1 = 2.5 GeV and the calculated value for ΓZ2[\cite=eewwsp6], we calculate the total cross sections for e+e-  →  W+1W-1,Z01Z01.

Now let us turn to our numerical results. Figures 1 and 2 show σ(e+e-  →  W+1W-1) for four different sets of mixing angles and a fixed MZ2 in comparison with the SM results. We see that the effects of the extra gauge bosons is more pronounced for φZ =  - φW. The deviations of σ from the SM result at [formula] GeV are 2.94 - 3.34% for |φZ|  =  |φW|  =  0.01 and MZ2 = 1 TeV. Considering the fact that the deviations were found to be less than 1.1% for |φZ|  =  0.05 and MZ2 = 500 GeV neglecting [formula] contribution[\cite=eewwsp6], it is very interesting to see that there is considerable contribution from the charged sector. Therefore, an accurate measurement (with statistical error ≤  1%) of σ at [formula] GeV at LEP II will be able to test the [formula] model at the level of |φZ|≃|φW|≃0.01. Figure 3 shows σ(e+e-  →  Z01Z01) for φZ  =    ±  0.01 and MZ2 = 1 TeV. The deviations from the SM result at [formula] GeV are ~  3.0%.

Summary and Conclusions

We have examined the processes e+e-  →  W+W- and Z0Z0 in the context of the [formula] model. Owing to the presence of the additional gauge bosons [formula] and [formula] in this model, total cross section σ(s) can be significantly different from that of the standard model. This effect is dependent on the mixing angles between Z(W) and [formula]. For mixing angles at the level of 1%, these deviations are roughly 3%, which should be detectable at LEPII. Thus, the production of W and Z pairs should provide a sensitive test of possible new physics beyond the SM.
