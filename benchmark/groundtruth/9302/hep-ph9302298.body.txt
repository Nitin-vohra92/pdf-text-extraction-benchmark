On the Current Correlators in QCD at Finite Temperature V.L. Eletsky[formula], Theoretical Physics Institute, University of Minnesota Minneapolis, MN 55455 B.L. Ioffe Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Moscow 117259, Russia Abstract

Current correlators in QCD at a finite temperature T are considered from the viewpoint of operator product expansion. It is stressed that at low T the heat bath must be represented by hadronic, and not quark-gluon states. A possibility to express the results in terms of T-dependent resonance masses is discussed. It is demonstrated that in order T2 the masses do not move and the only phenomenon which occurs is a parity and isospin mixing.

In the last years there has been an increasing interest in the study of the current correlators in QCD at finite temperatures. The hope is that investigating the same correlators both at high temperatures where the state of quark-gluon plasma is expected, and at low temperatures where the hadronic phase persists, a clear signal for a phase transition could be found. In this aspect of special interest is the temperature dependence of hadronic masses which manifest themselves through the behavior of correlators at large space-like distances, the appearance of poles in the correlation functions, etc. The calculations of the correlators are performed in the lattice simulations as well as by various analitical methods. (For reviews see, e.g., Refs.[\cite=deg] [\cite=sh]).

Among the analitical methods one of the most popular is the extension of QCD sum rule approach to the case of finite temperature. The idea is as follows. In the QCD sum rule method hadronic masses are obtained by investigation of current correlators and to a large extent are determined by the values of vacuum condensates. Therefore, if the temperature dependence of the condensates were known, it would also allow to find the temperature dependence of hadronic masses.

Unfortunately, in carrying out this program certain wrong steps were taken and a misunderstanding exists in the literature. However, a clear understanding of the possibilities of finite temperature QCD sum rules, or more generally, the possibilities of the operator product expansion in determination of current correlators at finite temperatures, is essential especially in comparing the results obtained in this approach with the ones in lattice calculations.

In this note we formulate (although partly it was done before in the literature) the basic points of the QCD sum rule method at finite temperature and principal results which are and could be obtained by this method.

The object under consideration is a thermal average of a current correlator defined as

[formula]

where j(x) is a colorless current which can have Lorentz and flavor indeces and can be a spinor, H is the QCD Hamiltonian and the sum is over all states of the spectrum. It is assumed that q2 is space-like, q2 < 0, and |q2| is much larger than a characteristic hadronic scale, |q2|  ≫  R- 2c, where Rc is the confinement radius, R- 1c  ~  0.5  GeV.

We consider the case of temperatures T below the phase transition temperature Tc. In principle, the summation over n in eq.([\ref=c]) can be performed over any full set of states |n〉 in the Hilbert space. It is clear however that at T < Tc the suitable set of states is the set of hadronic states, but not the quark-gluon basis. Indeed, in this case the original particles forming the heat bath, which is probed by external currents, are hadrons. The summation over the quark-gluon basis of states would require to take into account the full range of their interaction. This point was first mentioned in Ref.([\cite=dei]). In the previous papers[\cite=prev] devoted to the extension of QCD sum rules to finite temperatures and even in some following papers[\cite=fhs] this was not understood and the summation over |n〉 at low T was performed in the quark-gluon basis without account of confinement.

At low T  ≪  Tc the expansion in T / Tc can be performed. The main contribution comes from the pion states, |n〉 = |π〉,  |2π〉,  .... In the chiral limit, when u and d quarks and pions are massless, the expansion parameter is T2 / f2π where fπ = 1333  MeV is the pion decay constant: the one-pion contribution to Eq.([\ref=c]) is proportional to T2 / f2π, two-pion contribution is of order T4 / f2π, etc[\cite=dei]. The contributions of massive hadronic states |n〉 are suppressed by exp ( - mn / T).

At |q2|  ≫  R- 2c the operator product expansion (OPE) of T{j+(x),j(0)} on the light cone can be performed so the coefficient functions are T-independent. Here generally is a difference in comparison with the case of T = 0, where expansion at small xμ (or near the tip of the light cone) takes place. This follows from the fact that at q0 |q2 / 2mπ the matrix elements 〈n|T{j+(x),j(0)}|n〉 are similar to the matrix elements of deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering, where the process proseeds on the light cone, x2  ~  1 / |q2|, but the longitudinal distances, along the light cone are large and do not decrease with an increase of [formula]. In the interesting special cases, when q0 = 0 or [formula] and q0 pure imaginary, an OPE near the tip of the light cone can be performed ans a few terms in this expansion must be taken into account. In this expansion operators with nonzero spin s appear, unlike the case T = 0 where only spin zero operators contribute to the vacuum average. This fact is now well understood in the calculations done by QCD sum rule method at finite temperature[\cite=eek] [\cite=hkl] as well as at finite hadronic density[\cite=dl]-[\cite=dr]. At low temperatures where the pion states dominate in the chiral limit, the matrix elements of s  ≠  0 operators are proportional to Ts + 2. It must be mentioned that even for s = 0 operators and their vacuum expectation values (v.e.v.) not all of the techniques which were successful at T = 0 can be applied at T  ≠  0. For example, the factorization hypothesis which works well for v.e.v. of four-quark operators at T = 0 cannot be directly applied at T  ≠  0, because pion intermediate states should be accounted for[\cite=hkl] [\cite=e1].

In QCD sum rule method at T = 0 the v.e.v. of a current correlator calculated by OPE, is on the other hand represented by the contributions of physical states using a dispersion relation in q2 and in this way parameters of physical states (in particular, hadronic masses) were obtained. In this aspect the case of T  ≠  0 dramatically differs from the case of T = 0. The matrix elements

[formula]

where the sum is performed over all degrees of freedom of the state |n〉, are functions of two Lorentz invariants, q2 and νn = pnq (or sn = (pn + q)2) where pn is the momentum of the state |n〉. Therefore, to consider analitical properties of the amplitudes in question and represent them in terms of physical states, it is necessary to take into account that they have discontinuities in both q2 and sn (and also in the crossing channel, un = (pn - q)2). This was not done in QCD sum rule calculations at finite temperature[\cite=eek] [\cite=hkl] and density[\cite=c]-[\cite=hp]. (In Refs.[\cite=dl] [\cite=dr] an attempt was made to partly account for these effects at finite density).

It means that in writing down the dispersion relation in q2 it is necessary to specify at which values of other invariants it takes place. For example, if ν = nq = q0 (n = (1,0,0,0) is the time-like vector characterizing the heat bath) is fixed, then the contributions of intermediate physical states in s- and u-channel must be taken into account. In the case of isospin 1 vector current jμ(x) it follows, e.g. that besides the ρ-meson pole πρ states are also contributing. It must be kept in mind that the representation of the physical spectrum as a lowest resonance pole plus continuum which is standard in the QCD sum rule method at T = 0 is not suitable in the problem in question, because at least two poles and two different continua in two (- q2 and s) channels should be taken into account. Further, it is evident that an effective mass of the lowest hadronic state to be obtained in this approach, depends on the relation between q0 and [formula]. E.g., it should be different for the cases q0 = 0, [formula] and imaginary q0, |q0|  ≫  R- 1c, [formula].

For all these reasons the QCD sum rule approach does not generally look very promissing for the problem of calculation of masses of lowest hadronic states at finite temperature contrary to the case of T = 0, where this method proved to be very effective. However, the calculation of q- and x-dependences (the latter was recently advocated in[\cite=sh]) for various current correlators at finite temperature by the OPE on the light cone is still of a considerable interest. It would be very important, if lattice calculations of the same correlators at intermediate q2 and/or x2 could also be performed, because it would then give a possibility to determine T-dependences of various condensates.

As was shown in Ref.[\cite=dei], the situation essentially simplifies if we confine ourselves to the first order term in the expansion in T2. In this case apart from the vacuum state it is sufficient to take into account only the one-pion state in the sum over |n〉 in Eq.([\ref=c]). Its contribution can be calculated using PCAC and current algebra. In Ref.[\cite=dei] the correlators of isospin 1 vector and axial currents were considered and the following relations were found

[formula]

where CV,Aμν(q,T) are the correlators of V and A currents at finite temperature and CV,Aμν(q,0) are the same correlators at T = 0. In the chiral limit, ε = (1 / 3)(T2 / f2π). If CV,Aμν(q,0) are represented through dispersion relations by contributions of the physical states in V and A channels (ρ, a1, π, etc), then according to Eq.([\ref=mix]) the poles which are in the r.h.s. of Eq.([\ref=mix]), i.e. at T = 0, appear at the same positions in the l.h.s. Therefore, in order T2 the poles corresponding to ρ, a1 or π do not move. An important consequence of Eq.([\ref=mix]) is that at T  ≠  0 in the vector (transverse) channel apart from the poles corresponding to vector particles, there arise poles corresponding to axial particles and visa verse, i.e. a sort of parity mixing phenomenon occurs. The manifestation of this phenomenon is in complete accord with the general considerations presented above: the appearence of an a1 pole in the vector channel corresponds to singularities in the s-channel. In the same way a pion pole appears in the longitudinal part of the vector channel.

The statement that the poles do not move in order T2 is very general: it is based only on PCAC and current algebra and can be immediately extended to any other current correlators. (The result that the nucleon pole does not move in order T2 was obtained in the chiral perturbation theory in Ref.[\cite=ls] and by considering a current correlator in Ref.[\cite=e2]). The only interesting physical phenomenon which occurs in this order is the parity mixing, i.e. the appearence of states with opposite parity in the given channel and, in some cases, also an isospin mixing. The latter arises in baryon current correlators where, for example, in the current with the quantum numbers of Λ there appears a Σ pole, and in the nucleon channel there appear poles corresponding to baryon resonances with [formula] and [formula].

In the next order O(T4) such a simple picture where the current correlator at finite temperature is represented by the superposition of T = 0 correlators does not take place. Interpreted in terms of temperature dependent poles, it would mean that masses are shifted in this order. But as explained above such an interpretation can be ambiguous. We plan to discuss this problem in a future publication.
