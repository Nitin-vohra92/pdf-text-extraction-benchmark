Correlation inequalities for the quantum XY model

Introduction & results

Correlation inequalities, initially proposed by Griffiths [\cite=Gri], have been an invaluable tool in the study of several classical spin systems. They have helped to establish the infinite volume limit of correlation functions, the monotonicity of spontaneous magnetisation, and they have allowed to make comparisons between different spatial or spin dimensions. It would be helpful to have similar tools for the study of quantum systems, but results are scarce. Gallavotti has obtained inequalities for truncated functions in the case of the quantum XY model with spin 1/2 and pair interactions [\cite=Gal]. Inequalities for (untruncated) correlations in more general models were proposed in [\cite=FU].

In his extension of Griffiths' inequalities, Ginibre proposed a setting that also applies to quantum spin systems [\cite=Gin]. The goal of this note is to show that the quantum XY model fits the setting, at least with [formula] and S = 1. It follows that many truncated correlation functions take a fixed sign.

Let Λ denote the (finite) set of sites that host the spins. The Hilbert space of the model is [formula] with [formula]. Let Si, i = 1,2,3 denote usual spin operators on [formula]; that is, they satisfy the commutation relations   =  iS3, and other relations obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices 1,2,3. They also satisfy the identity (S1)2  +  (S2)2  +  (S3)2  =  S(S + 1). Finally, let [formula] denote the spin operator at site x. We consider the hamiltonian

[formula]

Here, JiA is a nonnegative coupling constant for each subset of A  ⊂  Λ and each spin direction i∈{1,2}. The expected value of an observable a (that is, an operator on HΛ) in the Gibbs state with hamiltonian HΛ and at inverse temperature β > 0 is

[formula]

where the normalisation Z(Λ) is the partition function

[formula]

Traces are taken in HΛ. We also consider Schwinger functions that are defined for s∈[0,1] by

[formula]

Our first result holds for [formula] and all temperatures.

Assume that JiA  ≥  0 for all A  ⊂  Λ and all i∈{1,2}. Assume also that [formula]. Then for all A,B  ⊂  Λ, and all s∈[0,1], we have

[formula]

Clearly, other inequalities can be generated using spin symmetries. The corresponding inequalities for the classical XY model have been proposed in [\cite=KPV].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq] can be found in Section [\ref=sec_S=1/2]. It is based on Ginibre's structure [\cite=Gin]. It is simpler than Gallavotti's, who used an ingenious approach based on the Trotter product formula, on a careful analysis of transition operators, and on Griffiths' inequalities for the classical Ising model [\cite=Gal]. Our proof allows us to go beyond pair interactions.

A consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq] is the monotonicity of certain spin correlations with respect to the coupling constants:

Under the same assumptions as in the above theorem, we have for all A,B  ⊂  Λ that

[formula]

The first inequality states that correlations increase when the coupling constants increase (in the same spin direction). The second inequality is perhaps best understood classically; if the first component of the spins increases, the other components must decrease because the total spin is conserved. Corollary [\ref=cor_ineq] follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq] since

[formula]

The case of higher spins, [formula], is much more challenging, but we have obtained an inequality that is valid in the ground state of the S = 1 model. Recall that the states 〈  ·  〉 and 〈  ·  ;  ·  〉s, defined in Eqs ([\ref=def_Gibbs]) and ([\ref=def_Schwinger]), depend on the inverse temperature β.

Assume that JiA  ≥  0 for all A  ⊂  Λ and all i∈{1,2}. Assume also that S = 1. Then for all A,B  ⊂  Λ, and all s∈[0,1], we have

[formula]

The proof of this theorem can be found in Section [\ref=sec_S=1]. It uses Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq].

The case [formula]

We can define the spin operators as [formula], where the σis are the Pauli matrices

[formula]

It is convenient to work with the hamiltonian with interactions in the 1-3 spin directions, namely

[formula]

Following Ginibre [\cite=Gin], we introduce the product space [formula]. Given an operator a on HΛ, we consider the operators a+ and a- on the product space, defined by

[formula]

The Gibbs state in the product space is

[formula]

where [formula]. We also need the Schwinger functions in the product space, namely

[formula]

For all observables a,b on HΛ, we have

[formula]

It is enough to prove the second line. The right side is equal to

[formula]

The first two lines of the right side give 2〈a;b〉s and the last two lines give 2〈a〉〈b〉.

Next, a simple lemma with a useful formula.

For all operators a,b on HΛ, we have

[formula]

The proof is straightforward algebra. Notice that both terms of the right side have positive factors. Now comes the key observation that leads to positive (and negative) correlations.

There exists an orthonormal basis on [formula] such that S1+,S1-,S3+, - S3- have nonnegative matrix elements.

As a consequence, there exists an orthonormal basis of [formula] such that S1x, +,S1x, -,S3x, +, and - S3x, - have nonnegative matrix elements.

For ε1,ε2  =    ±  , let |ε1,ε2〉 denote the eigenvectors of [formula] and [formula] with respective eigenvalues [formula] and [formula]. It is well-known that [formula] and similarly for [formula]. The convenient basis in [formula] consists of the following four elements:

[formula]

Direct calculations show that

[formula]

All other matrix elements are zero.

We use Lemma [\ref=lem_correlation] in order to get

[formula]

Expanding the exponentials in Taylor series, the right side is a sum of traces of

[formula]

with [formula]. One can replace - HΛ, + by a polynomial of operators with positive coefficients. Further, all products [formula] can be expanded using Lemma [\ref=lem_useful] in polynomials of Six,  ±, still with positive coefficients. Finally, we can replace all S3x, - by - S3x, - because their number is necessarily even. We now have the trace of a polynomial, with positive coefficients, of matrices with nonnegative elements (by Lemma [\ref=lem_key]). This is positive.

The second inequality (with S3 instead of S2) is similar. The only difference is that [formula] gives a polynomial where the number of S3x, - is odd. Hence the negative sign.

The case S = 1

This section is much more involved, and our result is sadly restricted to the ground state. Our strategy is inspired by the work of Nachtergaele on graphical representations of the Heisenberg model with large spins [\cite=Nac]. We consider a system where each site hosts a pair of spin [formula] particles. The inequalities of Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq] apply. By projecting onto the triplet subspaces, one gets a correspondence with the original spin 1 system. We prove that all ground states of the new model lie in the triplet subspace, so the inequality can be transferred. These steps are detailed in the rest of the section.

It is perhaps worth noticing that the tensor products in this section play a different rôle than those in Section [\ref=sec_S=1/2].

The new model

We introduce the new lattice Λ̃  =  Λ  ×  {1,2}. The new Hilbert space is

[formula]

Let Ri be the following operator on [formula]:

[formula]

Here, σi are the Pauli matrices in [formula] as before. We denote [formula] the corresponding operator at site x∈Λ. As before, we choose the interactions to be in the 1-3 spin directions; the hamiltonian on Λ is

[formula]

The coupling constants JiA are the same as those of the original model on HΛ. The expected value of an observable a in the Gibbs state with hamiltonian H̃Λ is

[formula]

where the normalisation (Λ) is the partition function

[formula]

We similarly define Schwinger functions 〈  ·  ;  ·  〉~s for s∈[0,1].

It is useful to rewrite H̃Λ as the hamiltonian of spin [formula] particles on the extended lattice Λ̃. Given a subset X  ⊂  Λ̃, we denote suppX its natural projection onto Λ, i.e.

[formula]

We also denote D(Λ̃) the family of subsets of Λ̃ where each site of Λ appears at most once. Notice that |D(Λ̃)|  =  3|Λ|. Finally, let us introduce the coupling constants

[formula]

From these definitions, we can write H̃Λ using Pauli operators as

[formula]

Correspondence with the spin 1 model

The Hilbert space at a given site, [formula], is the orthogonal sum of the triplet subspace (that is, the symmetric subspace, which is of dimension 3) and of the singlet subspace (of dimension 1). Let Ptriplet denote the projector onto the triplet subspace, and let [formula]. We define a new Gibbs state, namely

[formula]

with partition function [formula]. In order to state the correspondence between the models with different spins, let [formula] denote an isometry such that

[formula]

One can check that Si  =  V*RiV, i = 1,2,3, give spin operators in [formula]. Let [formula]. For all observables on a∈HΛ, we have the identity

[formula]

All ground states lie in the triplet subspace

Let QΛ,A be the projector onto triplets on A, and singlet on [formula]:

[formula]

One can check that = 0 for all i = 1,2,3, all x∈Λ, and all A  ⊂  Λ. Further, since the operators Ri give zero when applied on singlets, we have

[formula]

The ground state energy of H̃Λ is a strictly decreasing function of JiA, for all i = 1,3 and all A  ⊂  Λ.

It follows from this lemma and Eq. ([\ref=ham_in_subspace]) that all ground states lie in the subspace of QΛ,Λ  =  PtripletΛ. To see this, note that QΛ,A has the effect of setting J1B = 0 for [formula]. Then if A'  ⊃  A, QΛ,A'H̃Λ has larger coupling constants for those B such that [formula] but B  ⊂  A' (other coupling constants are unaffected). Hence having more sites in the triplet subspace leads to strictly lower energy.

We actually prove the result for the hamiltonian ([\ref=ham_new_look]) and the couplings iX, which implies the lemma. With E0(  ·  ) denoting the ground state energy of the operator ·  , we show that

[formula]

for any ε > 0, and any Y  ⊂  Λ̃. Let ψ0 denote the ground state of H̃Λ. It is also eigenstate of   e-  H̃Λ   with the largest eigenvalue. Using the Trotter product formula, we have

[formula]

which, in the basis where the Pauli matrices are given by ([\ref=def_Pauli]), is a product of matrices with nonnegative elements. By a Perron-Frobenius argument, ψ0 can be chosen as a linear combination of the basis vectors with nonnegative coefficients.

There are now two possibilities. The first possibility is that [formula]. Then it is positive, and

[formula]

the conclusion follows. The second possibility is that [formula]. Without loss of generality, adding a constant if necessary, we can assume that E0(H̃Λ)  ≤  0. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Inequality ([\ref=this_is_enough]) follows in this case too.

One can replace σ1x with σ3x and prove Inequality ([\ref=this_is_enough]) in the same fashion; indeed, one can choose a basis where σ3 is like σ1 in ([\ref=def_Pauli]), and σ1 is like -  σ3.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq2]

We can assume that for any x∈Λ, there exist i∈{1,3} and A∋x such that JiA  >  0 -- the extension to the general case is straightforward. Since all ground states lie in the triplet subspace, we have for all subsets A,B  ⊂  Λ and for all s∈[0,1],

[formula]

We used Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq]. We have obtained the first inequality of Theorem [\ref=thm_ineq2]. The second inequality follows in the same way.
