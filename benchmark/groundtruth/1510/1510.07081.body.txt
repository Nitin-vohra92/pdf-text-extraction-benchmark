Some new results on consecutive equidivisible integers

Introduction

We let τ(n) denote the number of positive divisors of a positive integer n. Following [\cite=DE], we say positive integers m and n to be equidivisible if τ(m) = τ(n). For each [formula], let D(k) be the set of positive integers which begin maximal runs of equidivisible numbers with exactly k divisors. More precisely,

[formula]

We let D(k,s) denote the set of numbers a∈D(k) such that τ(a + i) = k for 0  ≤  i  ≤  s - 1 and τ(a + s)  ≠  k. In other words, D(k,s) is the set of positive integers n that start runs of s consecutive integers with exactly k divisors. For example, 33 and 85 both belong to D(4,3). Clearly, for a fixed k and varying s, the sets D(k,s) are pairwise disjoint and form a partition of D(k). For n∈D(k) we write L(n) = s if n∈D(k,s).

It is easy to see that for each k, we have [formula] for all large enough s. On the other hand, Erdös conjectured that for every s, [formula] for some k, i.e., there exists sequences of consecutive equidivisible integers of any length (see [\cite=GUY]).

Let

[formula]

So M(k) = 1 for all odd k because two squares cannot be consecutive positive integers and M(2) = 2 because (2,3) is the only pair of consecutive primes. Another trivial example is M(4)  =  3. Indeed, L(33) = 3 and if n > 8 is divisible by 4 then τ(n)  ≥  4.

Table [\ref=table1] gives known ranges for M(k) for every even k < 30, according to [\cite=DE].

In 2006, Ali and Mishutka [\cite=BM] showed that M(24)  ≥  12.

We have found exact values of M(k) for 55 fixed values of k. Also we have shown that M(12)  ≥  10. Finally, we have found six runs of 13 and two runs of 14 consecutive equidivisible numbers each having exactly 24 divisors.

Results

Consecutive integers with 2p divisors

First of all, let us consider the case k = 2p, where p > 3 is prime. Düntsch and Eggleton [\cite=DE] proved that M(2p)  ≤  3. It seems that it is exactly equal to 3. Letting n = 3p - 1r1, n + 1 = 2p - 1r2, n + 2 = qp - 1r3 or n = qp - 1r1, n + 1 = 2p - 1r2, n + 2 = 3p - 1r3 for suitable primes q, r1, r2, r3, we have found many examples of n in D(2p,3) by Chinese remainder theorem. Moreover, for all these p we have found the smallest corresponding n. For instance, let p = 11. Then n = 310  ·  1765118938727 starts the least triple for q = 5. Since 5310 > n it is sufficient to look over the triples for q  ≤  47. It remains to note that for each of these q we need to check only a small number of cases.

The correspondence between p and n for all prime 5  ≤  p  ≤  47 is given by the Table [\ref=table3]. In fact, we have found the necessary triples for every prime p < 200. Full list one can see at the website of Mathematical Marathon [\cite=MM].

It was observed that q = 5 in all smallest triples we found. Of course, this property for smallest triples is not guaranteed for all p. While we have not yet observed a minimal triple with q  ≠  5. The following example may serve as indirect evidence for their existence. For p = 5, q = 19, the smallest triple starts at n = 130,358,662,767, while p = 5, q = 43 give even a smaller start of the smallest triple at n = 3,388,031,791.

Exact values of M(k) for k divisible by 4 and nondivisible by 3

Let k is a positive integer such that k > 4, 4|k and [formula]. If [formula] then 3|τ(n). Hence it can not be equal to k. Therefore M(k)  ≤  7 and for every positive integer n starting a run of 7 numbers each having k divisors we have [formula].

Apparently, for the considered values k M(k) is exactly equal to 7.

We show the method of constructing of required runs for k = 20. Chinese remainder theorem provides existence of infinite number of positive integers n such that

[formula]

and all prime factors of numbers [formula] are greater than 17.

For positive integer n = 76,043,484,008,534,356,379,398,200,621 satisfying conditions [\eqref=cond7] numbers q1,q2,q4,q6 are prime and τ(q3) = τ(q5) = τ(q7) = 4. Hence this n starts a run of 7 numbers each having 20 divisors.

Of course, conditions [\eqref=cond7] are not necessary. Our choose of moduli is largely arbitrary.

We used a similar technique to obtain M(k) = 7 for some other values k. The correspondence between these k and n with L(n) = M(k) = 7 is given by the Table [\ref=table4].

Exact value of M(18)

We describe the case of k = 18 in more detail. First of all, note that τ(n) = 18 implies that n has one of the following forms: p17, p8q, p5q2, or p2q2r, where p, q, r are primes. It immediately follows that if prime p|n but [formula] then n = pa2 for some positive integer a coprime to p.

Let n starts a run of 5 consecutive numbers with 18 divisors each. Düntsch and Eggleton [\cite=DE] showed that [formula]. Hence n + 1 = 2a2 and n + 3 = 4c where a = pq or a = p4, c = r2s or c = r5 for some odd primes p,q,r,s. Now we can prove that n + 2 is divisible by 3.

We have 3 possibilities: 3|n, 3|(n + 1), or 3|(n + 2).

If 3|n then n = 3b2 or n = 9b. In the former case, we have 3b2 + 1 = 2a2, which has no solutions modulo 3. In the latter case, we have n + 3 = 12p2. Considering n + 1 = 2a2 one can get 2a2 + 2 = 12p2, which again has no solutions modulo 3. Therefore n is not divisible by 3.

If 3|(n + 1) then n + 1 = 18p2 for some prime p > 3 (the case of n + 1 = 2  ·  38 is obviously impossible). Hence n + 4 = 3b2, implying that 6p2 = b2 - 1, which is impossible since the right hand side is divisible by 8 and [formula]. Therefore n + 1 is not divisible by 3 either.

Hence, we must have 3|(n + 2), which we satisfy by assuming that n + 2 = 9b. Since one of the five consecutive numbers must be divisible by 5, we let n + 4 = 25d. These assumptions fulfill the divisibility requirements by small primes.

We further find it convenient to assume the following forms of the integers: n = p21p22p3, n + 2 = 9p24p5, n + 3 = 4p26p7, n + 4 = 25p28p9, where [formula] are distinct primes greater than 5.

Let m1  =  p21p22, m2  =  9p24, m3  =  4p26, and m4  =  25p28. We choose p1, p2, p4, p6, and p8 be small primes such that the following system of quadratic congruences is solvable:

[formula]

Since the moduli in system [\eqref=syst] are pairwise coprime and each congruence has 4 solutions, by Chinese remainder theorem the system solution consists of 256 classes of positive integers {xi + jm}j  ≥  0, where 1  ≤  i  ≤  256 and 0  ≤  xi < m = m1m2m3m4. Each class can give us n = 2(xi + jm)2 - 1 as soon as n / m1, (n + 2) / m2, (n + 3) / m3, (n + 4) / m4 are prime and xi + jm = qr or xi + jm = q4 for some primes q, r.

The smallest known n starting 5 numbers with 18 divisors each was obtained for p1 = 7, p2 = 17, p4 = 11, p6 = 13, p8 = 29, and j = 260. It is equal to

[formula]

Using computer search one can obtain many other numbers (for the aforementioned and other values of m1, m2, m3, m4) in D(18,5).

New lower bounds for M(12) and M(24)

We have found n with τ(n) = 12 and L(n) = 10, implying that M(12)  ≥  10.

We have searched desired run looking over numbers n such that

[formula]

First of all, these conditions fulfill the divisibility requirements by 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. We choose additional conditions to increase empiric probability of required number of divisors for psitive integers qi.

Let [formula]. Using Chinese remainder theorem we have found the least positive integer p0 = 7,623,414,751,537,859, satisfying to the system of linear congruences:

[formula]

We have looked over positive integers p = p0 + jm, where [formula]. For each p which is prime we can obtain n = ap - 6 and numbers [formula] from conditions [\eqref=cond10]. It is enough to us to find j for which q2,q3,q6,q7,q8,q9 are prime and τ(q1) = τ(q4) = τ(q5) = 4. The smallest j satisfying these conditions is j = 647,045,875, which corresponds to n = 1,545,780,028,345,667,311,380,575,449 starting a run of 10 consecutive equidivisible numbers each having exactly 12 divisors.

Using similar construction, we have also found six runs of 13 consecutive numbers each having exactly 24 divisors. Smallest of them starts at

[formula]

This number gives the upper bound for A006558(13) in the OEIS [\cite=OEIS] (A006558(n) starts the first run of n consecutive integers with same number of divisors).

Finally, we have found two runs of 14 consecutive equidivisible numbers each having exactly 24 divisors. The first run starts at

[formula]

which was obtained in the form [formula] with m = 331,805,549,004,454,324,800, p0 = 92,513,784,488,630,385,533, and j = 4,373,940,659. The second run starts at

[formula]

which was obtained for the same values of m and p0 but j = 9,416,976,775,575. Thus M(24)  ≥  14. Of course, the smallest of these numbers gives the upper bound for A006558(14).

Our results confirm the Erdös conjecture for s  ≤  14.

Smallest elements of D(k,s)

Table [\ref=table2] gives a smallest known element n∈D(k,s) for every even k below 30, where s is greatest known number with [formula].

Numbers n which are guaranteed to be the smallest in the corresponding D(k,L(n)) are in bold. Sign "[formula]" in the n column showes that corresponding n have been discovered by the author of this paper.
