Bright Solid State Source of Photon Triplets

The most widespread technique for generating multipartite photon correlations relies on spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) with low conversion efficiency[\cite=Bouwmeester1999] and restricted scalability, which limits its production rate and applications. In contrast, quantum dots offer the most practical route in building scalable quantum architectures and their efficiency reaches almost unity per excitation pulse, enabling high count rates. The ground state of a single quantum dot hosts at most two bright excitons[\cite=Moreau2001], a biexciton, which can be controlled coherently[\cite=Jayakumar2014] to produce photon pairs. Thus creation of multipartite photon correlations in single quantum dots requires using higher shells and phonon-mediated processes which lead to relatively low efficiency and complicated excitation methods[\cite=Persson2004] [\cite=Schmidgall2014]. The coupled s shells of a quantum dot molecule (QDM), however, render additional excitonic states suitable for scaling up the number of correlated photons under present coherent schemes. A realization of photon triplets from a QDM serves as an elementary step for direct generation of multiphoton entanglement, which has been so far limited to biphotons in solid state systems[\cite=Stevenson2006]. Nevertheless, the creation of threefold correlations in QDMs is not straightforward. First, the interdot coupling strength must be tailored to form three correlated excitons. Second, all resonances of the QDM photoluminescence (PL) spectrum must be identified via a combination of magneto-optical and photon statistics experiments. Finally, photon triplets emerge in a certain range of excitation power and their observation is challenged by the collection and detection efficiencies.

Our QDM is composed of two InAsxP1 - x segments embedded inside an InP photonic nanowire that incorporates core and cladding regions[\cite=Huber2014] (Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]a). The thick cladding of 250 nm in diameter aids funnelling the QDM emission into the fundamental [formula] mode[\cite=Bleuse2011] to be guided out toward the collection optics. The cladding is gently tapered ([formula]) at its apex to improve the photon extraction efficiency (Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]b). The molecule contains two [formula]3-4 nm thick dots [formula]18-20 nm in diameter as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]c) and finite element simulations (). The growth of the second dot [formula] is influenced by the strain field caused by the formation of the first dot [formula] during the process, giving rise to the molecule asymmetry. This inherent asymmetry aids the localization of carrier, especially hole, wavefunctions mainly in individual quantum dots rather than evenly spreading throughout the molecule[\cite=Stinaff2006]. We aimed for ~  10 nm interdot spacing, however despite using vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) growth mode, Arsenic tailing in our dots possibly reduces the effective separation d slightly ([formula] nm). Considering the low Arsenic concentration (0.15 < x < 0.25), a thinner spacing would lift the barrier and aid delocalization or would promote the directional tunneling in asymmetric QDMs, whereas a larger spacing would impair the interdot coupling.

The correlation of excitons residing in different dots can originate from both hybridization of the s-shell molecular wavefunctions and from long-range Coulomb interactions[\cite=Bayer2001] [\cite=Bester2004]. The hybridization is likely to play a minor role in our samples due to the sizeable interdot spacing of about 8-10 nm and the molecule asymmetry. By the same arguments, the formation probability of optically active interdot excitons should be small[\cite=Beirne2006]. The QDM under investigation shows two distinguished high energy (H.E.) and low energy (L.E.) sets of spectral resonances at ~  894 nm and ~  940 nm corresponding to its molecular s-shell transitions (Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]e). In addition to the conventional exciton ([formula] or [formula]) and biexciton ([formula] or [formula]) transitions belonging to [formula] and [formula], there exist energy-shifted biexciton and exciton transitions, [formula] at λ1 = 894.5 nm and [formula] at λ2 = 893.1 nm emerging due to Coulomb interaction with [formula] at λ3 = 940.9 nm. The carrier configuration related to the transitions creating the photon triplet are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]d. They are conceived acknowledging that interdot recombination is unlikely and [formula] and [formula] are located in the H.E. set. For simplicity we name these two latter transitions "triexciton" and "separated biexciton", respectively. We investigated the excitation power-dependent PL intensity of these resonances and observed the expected linear and superlinear behaviours for both regular and energy-shifted excitons and biexcitons, respectively (Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]f). The emergence of [formula] at the lowest excitation levels makes the conditional formation of separated biexciton and triexciton in [formula] more likely than that of [formula] and [formula]. [formula] grows on the shoulder of the neighbouring [formula] resonance at higher excitation levels, which hinders resolving its power dependence over the entire range.

We conducted magneto-optical experiments to identify the resonances by comparing their Zeeman splitting to the theoretically predicted values. A bright exciton such as [formula] comprises a spin doublet [formula] which splits by [formula] in Faraday configuration (magnetic field B|| applied along the nanowire axis), where [formula] ([formula]) represents the electron (heavy hole) spin, [formula] is the axial exciton g-factor and μB is the Bohr magnetron. A regular biexciton has zero spin, thus its transition to the exciton state experiences the same splitting. The interdot biexciton [formula] is however fourfold degenerate [formula] at  = 0 with four bright decay channels down to the [formula] doublet, [formula] and [formula], if spin flip processes[\cite=Khaetskii2000] are ruled out. These decay channels split into two doublets spaced by [formula]. Finally, the triexciton produces a bright spin doublet [formula] which decays via two doubly degenerate transitions to the separated biexciton, [formula] and [formula], with [formula] energy splitting. We investigated the QDM PL under magnetic field in the Faraday (not shown here) and a tilted ([formula]) configurations (Fig. [\ref=fig:magneto]a). We are aware that Zeeman coupling of spin bright and dark states and hence a fourfold splitting of the fine structure in charged excitons should occur even at small magnetic fields in the tilted configuration, whereas the intrinsic dark-bright splitting in neutral excitons prohibits such mixing except for high field magnitudes[\cite=Witek2011]. Observation of dual splittings in tilted configuration would therefore imply that the resonances do not originate from charged states. The PL intensity versus magnetic field Bθ and wavelength is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:magneto](b), where the dashed lines indicate the evolution of resonances. The H.E. set is displayed in higher pumping levels (P2 = 10P1) well above the onset of triexciton emission. We fit the spectral peak displacement with ±  gX,θ  μB  Bθ  +  γX,θ  B2θ to remove the diamagnetic shift ([formula]) present in the weak-field regime[\cite=Bayer1998], and obtain [formula] and [formula] for the L.E. exciton and [formula] and [formula] for the separated biexciton. The spectra and corresponding Zeeman splittings of the [formula] (and [formula]) doublets along with [formula] (and [formula]) singlets at [formula] are shown in Figs. [\ref=fig:magneto]c-d, verifying that [formula] and [formula].

The next step was to measure the second-order autocorrelation function[\cite=Santori2002] of each individual resonance and the cross-correlation functions[\cite=Moreau2001] g(2)αβ(τ) between various pairings (α,β) of distinct resonances (ταβ = tDα - tDβ denotes the delay time between photon detections). These correlations can provide insight into the coupling strength and the nature of the lines[\cite=Gerardot2005]. An autocorrelation experiment on every QDM resonance in our sample verified their low multiphoton emission probability by featuring an antibunching dip at τ = 0. Among all possible cross correlations of QDM resonances, the ones measured between [formula], [formula], and [formula] are of highest interest for the photon triplet characterization. A triplet state comprising temporally correlated photons [formula] originates from a triple sequential cascade in the QDM (Fig. [\ref=fig:Structure-Spectrum]d). In our correlation setup illustrated in the , a diffraction grating separates the [formula], [formula], and [formula] photons towards the detectors D1, D2 and D3. All cross-correlations g(2)αβ(τ) of the above three resonances feature an asymmetric bunching-antibunching behaviour[\cite=Moreau2001] as expected for cascade transitions (Figs. [\ref=fig:CC]a-c). The cross-correlations between [formula] ([formula]) and [formula] are fitted with [formula] (τ < 0) resulting in [formula] 0.71 (0.59) considerably smaller than unity, which indicates that the system is indeed a molecule rather than two separate dots. Similarly, the cross correlations among the remaining L.E. and H.E. resonances featured above antibunching characteristic.

In order to prove that the QDM actually emits a photon triplet, we conducted a triple coincidence experiment[\cite=LahmamBennani1989] by sending detector pulses D1 (as Start), D2 (as Stop1) and D3 (as Stop 2) into a time-tagging device. The time-resolved histogram versus τ21 and τ31 features a fully random contribution due to uncorrelated photons (319 counts) along with three contributions each coming from two correlated photons and the third being accidental resulting in a total level of (partially correlated) triple events of 618.6 counts. We observe a large number of threefold coincidences in the vicinity of zero time delay (Fig. [\ref=fig:CC]d) above the partially correlated events. We record 20744 photon counts in total (including 8932 background counts) integrated in 3 hours in the coincidence window of [formula] and [formula] (see Fig. [\ref=fig:CC]e). After subtracting the background we are left with 11812 photon triplets corresponding to an average detection rate of 65.62 triplets per minute. We estimate that only 0.15% of all photon triplets could be detected because of the low detection efficiency of our detectors, [formula] ([formula], [formula] and [formula] at the respective wavelengths), along with non-ideal extraction efficiency ([formula] at [formula][\cite=Reimer2012]), fibre coupling efficiency ([formula]) and grating efficiency ([formula]). The above photon triplet rate is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest recorded rate exceeding the value of 11.1 per min reported for direct generation of photon triplets via cascaded SPDC[\cite=Hamel2014].

In general, the bunching peak g(2)αβ(0+) of a cascade decreases with the excitation rate, because the ratio of true cascade events versus individual excitations becomes less favorable, as has been observed in regular biexciton-exciton cascades of single quantum dots[\cite=Kuroda2009]. We examined this behavior by applying increasing levels of pump power while recording the cross correlations between the triexciton and the other two resonances (see Fig. [\ref=fig:Powerseries]). The measurements were conducted in a regime where the resonance PL intensity to background hardly changed, thus the variation in the bunching peak was mainly a function of the ratio between the excitation rate and transition lifetimes. The suppression of bunching visibility agrees with the results of our theoretical model based on the time propagation matrix method[\cite=Gerardot2005], as explained in the , and reconfirms the cascaded nature of the selected transitions.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a triexciton bound in a QDM can originate time-ordered photon triplets in a cascaded process. The present source is brighter than any existing source in terms of triplet generation rate. We expect to improve this rate by reducing the inter-dot energy splitting, deterministic coherent pulsed excitation of the triexciton to reduce the background, enhanced collection efficiency and the use of more efficient detectors. A triexciton forming in the s shells of a QDM benefits from far better coherence properties than the p-shell triexcitons[\cite=Schmidgall2014] in single quantum dots because it does not involve any phonon assisted transisions. It can therefore be deterministically controlled via resonant pumping for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger[\cite=Bouwmeester1999] (GHZ) and W[\cite=Eibl2004] states entangled in either polarization[\cite=Huber2014] or time-bin[\cite=Jayakumar2014]. With earlier the demonstration of quantum-dot-based quantum key distribution (QKD)[\cite=Waks2002], our device opens new avenues toward implementation of multiparty quantum secret sharing on integrated semiconductor chips.

Methods

Nanowire-QDM Fabrication The InP nanowires with embedded In(As)P quantum dots are grown using selective-area VLS epitaxy. The nanowires are grown on a SiO2-patterned (111)B InP substrate. The pattern consists of circular holes defined using electron-beam lithography and hydrofluoric acid wet-etch. A single gold particle is deposited in each hole using a self-aligned lift-off process, with the size of the particle determined by the hole size and the thickness of deposited gold. We employ chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) with trimethylindium (TMI) and pre-cracked PH3 and AsH3 sources. The growth temperature is [formula]C. Two growth modes are utilized to grow (i) a nanowire core, which defines the quantum dots, and (ii) a shell, which defines the cladding of photonic nanowire. The nanowire core is grown under a reduced PH3 flow resulting in an untapered InP nanowire with a diameter corresponding to the gold catalyst particle, approximately 20 nm in this work. The nanowires are pure phase wurtzite with less than 1 stacking fault per micron[\cite=Dalacu2012]. The double In(As)P quantum dots are grown by switching the group V species from phosphorous to arsenic to grow the first dot, switching back to phosphorous to grow the InP spacer, then switching back to arsenic to grow the second dot while maintaining a constant flux of TMI. Samples were grown with quantum dot growth times of 2.5 and 3 seconds, and with spacer times of 10, 15, and 60 seconds. The interdot spacing for a given growth time between dots depends on the core diameter due to a diameter-dependent growth rate[\cite=Dalacu2009]. By using a diameter-dependent growth model[\cite=Dalacu2009] we calculate an interdot separation of 10-20 nm for core diameters of 18-24 nm. Details of the spacer-dependent interdot coupling are beyond the scope of this work and will be published elsewhere. The spacer of QDM studied here is 10 seconds (~   8-10 nm) that provides the optimum coupling. The nanowire shell is grown by increasing the PH3 flow rate by a factor of three, which reduces the Indium adatom migration length and promotes deposition on the nanowire sidewall facets. The shell is grown to reach base diameters of 250 nm, resulting in nanowires with heights of ~   5 μm and tapers of [formula].

Optical Experiments The sample is cooled down to 6 K in a customized and thermally stabilized liquid-Helium continuous-flow cryostat. The QDM is nonresonantly excited either by a cw or a ps-pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser at 820 nm with 8.4 ps pulse duration (80 MHz repetition rate) slightly above the wurtzite InP band gap 1.49 eV (832 nm) and the donor-acceptor recombination level 1.44 eV (861 nm). We excite the QDM via a separate objective rather than the collecting objective even though this is not reflected in the setup schematic in . The molecule luminescence is collected using an objective lens with numerical aperture (NA) of 0.7 and dispersed by grating monochromators with spectral resolution of ~  0.01 nm to split the spectral lines and send the respective photons into separate avalanche photodiodes (APD). APDs are identical with ~  300 ps temporal resolution and ~  25% (~  15%) detection efficiency at 893 nm (940 nm). The combination of spectrometer and charge coupled device (CCD) camera enables performing in-situ spectroscopy during the recording of counts in the correlation measurement setup (composed of APDs and ps time-tagging module). Only two APDs register the photon counts to conduct the autocorrelation and the conventional dual-channel cross correlation analysis, whereas all the three APDs are in use for the triple coincidence experiment. In the dual-channel correlation measurements, the H.E. set resonances are cross correlated utilizing two 5 micron core optical fibres for photon collection. In the triple coincidence experiment, we collected from the L.E. set using a single mode fibre with 9 micron core optimized for telecommunication wavelength, that operates similar to a multimode fibre at 940 nm. However, owing to the small core radius the background light picked up from [formula] is suppressed and the antibunching dip in triple coincidence histogram is improved. To produce the power-dependent cross correlation histograms in cw excitation mode, we started from 220[formula] (with 4 [formula] spot size and excitation objective tilted 22[formula] from the optical table axis) and raised the pump power thus to linearly increase the shifted biexciton [formula]. Therefore the pump power scales up approximately in a quadratic fashion until the [formula] resonance is saturated. In order to resolve the associated lifetimes, the QDM is heavily pumped within each pulse using the Ti:Sapphire laser in a way that its resulting spectrum exactly resembles the one under cw excitation. For magneto-optical measurements the setup remains unchanged except that the cryostat is replaced by a continuous flow exchange gas cryostat with a 7 T split-pair superconducting magnet. The QDM is excited co-linear to the collection through the collection objective with a Ti:Sapphire laser. For the mixed Voigt-Faraday (tilted) configuration the sample is rotated [formula] inside the cryostat.

Interdot coupling versus spacing

We performed a PL spectroscopy measurement on an ensemble of nanowire-embedded QDMs. Low excitation powers were applied to avoid the activation of multiexciton complexes. The dependence of the exciton resonance associated with each dot, [formula] and [formula], on the interdot spacing is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:Ensemble]. Since the spacing is a function of both the QDM diameter and the growth time (see ), the diameter-dependent shifts of the [formula] and [formula] resonances are removed in order to give better insight into the effect of spacing. The evolution of these two emission energies versus the interdot spacing, on average, agrees with previous experimental observations. At a constant pump power, we consistently noticed the decrease in the PL intensity of the H.E. set (or [formula]) by reducing the spacing until it almost disappeared for [formula]. This perhaps indicates the direct carrier tunneling from the smaller dot into the larger dot with tunneling rates higher than the exciton decay rate in the smaller dot. For a large spacing, for example [formula], an energy separation of at most 50 meV exists between the two resonances, which originates from difference in the size and composition of the two quantum dots. However, at a lower spacing, the energy separation increases, partly because of the stronger hybridization energy of the QDM. This proves that at ~  10 nm spacing (corresponding to the QDM studied in the main text), a combination of both wavefunction hybridization and Coulomb interactions contribute to couple the dots.

Single particle wavefunctions, hybridization and QDM asymmetry

In this section, we represent the results of a finite element (FE) modeling that aid us design and comprehend the QDM structure. The exciton energy is a strong function of the quantum dot height when the axial aspect ratio [formula] is lower than 0.2, as in our QDM. To blueshift the resonances within the operation range of APDs, the quantum dot composition (InAs0.15P0.85) and thickness (3 nm) are carefully tailored using the chemical flow and the growth time window. According to our growth rates and TEM images of the nanowire core, the quantum dot thickness and diameter are 3-4 nm and 20 nm, respectively. The impact of the first dot strain field on the second dot growth is characterized by a slight change in composition and thickness; see Fig. [\ref=fig:QDM](a). The likely height ratio (1.3) and Arsenic concentration (x = 0.24) of the second dot was later amended to comply with the observed QDM spectrum. The pale regions in Fig. [\ref=fig:QDM](a) symbolically illustrate the Arsenic tail of the quantum dot inside the wurtzite InP, which inhibits assuming an exact composition and thickness for each dot. Our model does not account for such details. A short description of the FE simulation is provided below.

We first solve for the electron and hole single particle energies and wavefunctions of the QDM, then calculate the mutual Coulomb interactions to construct the excitonic energy level structure. The transition energies (up to the s shell of [formula]) along with their corresponding electron and hole probability densities [formula] are plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:QDM]. [formula] stands for the non-excitonic band gap ([formula] eV, [formula] eV, [formula] eV, [formula] eV) whereas the excitonic energy [formula] ([formula] eV, [formula] eV, [formula] eV, [formula] eV) accounts for the binding energy [formula] ([formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]) as well. The computed energy level structure agrees with the spectral analysis of our QDM. The ~  70 meV energy spacing between the L.E. and H.E. sets indicates the composition difference of the two quantum dots, because a tangible size difference is not concluded from the TEM images, nor can be expected from almost identical growth times.

The probability densities depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:QDM](b) imply that the holes are fully localized while electron wavefunctions are hybridized. The electron and hole wavefunctions also reshape due to the Coulomb interactions and Fermionic correlations, which renormalize the transition energies and appear as milielectron volts shift. Coulomb interactions are long range because they originate from the electrostatic energy a certain carrier spends to stay within the mean field potential of a source carrier, [formula], where e0 and εr are the charge unit and the medium permittivity, respectively. For an interdot spacing equivalent to 8-10 nm, such long-range conditional probability promotes the energy shift of spectral lines. The FE simulations suggest that the interdot electron-hole Coulomb interactions, [formula] meV and [formula] meV, are comparable to the intradot exciton binding energies and play an important role in shifting the multiexciton resonances.

Finite element simulation method

The single particle energies and wavefunctions ψ(r) are solved for both electrons and holes by diagonalizing the 8-band k  ·  p hamiltonian. The hamiltonian parameters are well defined for zincblende InP and InAs crystals, however we utilize the zincblende parameters for our wurtzite structures to obtain a qualitative understanding of the QDM energy level structure. The energy band gap of InP and InAs are however corrected according to the empirically measured wurtzite band gaps, [formula]eV and [formula]eV. To solve for the strain field, the strain energy is calculated and minimized in the core-shell structure using the continuum mechanical model. The bottom surface is kept fixed (no displacement) while it is assumed that the QDM stress relaxes at the top surface at specific points on the shell perimeter. The piezoelectric potential was calculated inside a 200×  200×  200 [formula] cell by solving the Poisson's equation associated with the piezoelectric charge density on an adapted nonuniform 3D grid with gradual growth of the element length outside the shell. Periodic boundary conditions were applied along the nanowire axis while Dirichlet boundary conditions were assigned to the cell sidewalls (perpendicular to the growth direction). For solving the 8-band k  ·  p hamiltonian, the Dirichlet boundary condition is applied at the sidewalls of the effective shell (50 nm in diameter), [formula] and [formula], while the continuity of probability current across the interior interfaces is preserved. To calculate the Coulomb interactions, we first computed the mean field potential of s and p-shell carriers (within the same cell considered for solving the piezoelectric potential), then found the mutual attractive and repulsive interactions via configuration interaction method.

Measurement setup

We use either cw or pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser to pump the QDM depending on the nature of experiment as described in . The emission of cryogenically cooled nanowire-QDM is either sent to the spectroscopy module, composed of spectrometer and CCD, or photon statistics module, composed of gratings for dispersing photons and correlation setup (APDs and time-tagging card) for recording the correlation histogram. To resolve triple coincidence counts, photons from [formula], [formula] and [formula] are sent to three identical APDs (D1-D3). The polarization module, composed of quarter wave plate (QWP), half wave plate (HWP) and polarizer (Pol) is employed to measure fine structure splittings.

Experimental cross-correlation of [formula] and [formula]

A verification to the neutrality of the state configurations originating [formula] and [formula] transitions is their cross correlation. By definition, the formation of interdot biexciton that initiates the [formula] transition, relies on the existence of excitons in both quantum dots. Therefore the [formula] transition cannot coexist with a single exciton decay in the left quantum dot, [formula], and their cross-correlation function must show a clear antibunching. Such antibunching characteristic was experimentally resolved by correlating [formula] and [formula], as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:CC13]. The absence of noticeable asymmetry in the cross-correlation antibunching in combination with magneto-PL results explained in the main text suggest that the originating particles are neutral. We also cross-correlated [formula] and [formula] lines to ensure they are pure exciton and biexciton sitting in the left dot, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:CC13](b).

Cross-correlation curves and bunching visibility

To calculate the temporal correlations, we present a numerical model incorporating the energy levels along with the pumping and decay rates of important transitions. The model includes eight energy states [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:Diagram]. The three primary transitions scrutinized in the main text are highlighted with thick coloured arrows. We limit our Hilbert space up to the triexciton level because the formation of higher states is unlikely at the applied pump powers and their effect on temporal characteristics of desired resonances is trivial.

The diagram plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:Diagram] can be represented in an 8×  8 time propagation matrix expanded on [formula] where [formula]:

[formula]

.

The time evolution of [formula] is obtained by diagonalizing [formula], [formula], and [formula] is given by [formula], where (t) is the unitary time evolution operator [formula]. Here [formula] ([formula]) is the pumping rate of the exciton in the smaller (larger) dot. We assume that when the s shell is already occupied with an exciton, the effective pumping rate to form the second exciton ([formula], [formula]) is lower. [formula] ([formula]) here is the recombination rate of an exciton in the smaller (larger) quantum dot. To extract [formula] and [formula] from the time-resolved PL experiments, we averaged over the [formula] and [formula] lifetimes measured at eight increasing pump powers and used the following relations: [formula], [formula] (see Fig. [\ref=fig:lifetime]a). The applied excitation powers are the same as used in the main text for observing the variations in the bunching visibility. Although the intrinsic lifetime of an exciton commonly deviates from a mono-exponential fit in a cascade recombination, we employed the average exciton decay rates considering that their variations versus pump power were negligible ([formula]). We also note that the [formula], [formula] and [formula] lifetimes comply with the ordering required for their cascaded nature, i.e. [formula].

We accounted for the direct energy transfer (Förster transfer) of excitons among the two s shells as characterized by [formula] in the diagram. Förster transfer originates from long-range interdot Coulomb interactions (beyond the dipole-dipole approximation) and its rate depends on several parameters including energy difference of QDM s shells ([formula]), interdot spacing and QDM symmetry. Note that a sizeable interdot Coulomb coupling does not necessarily lead to the exciton Förster transfer, because the transfer matrix element in QDMs with broken symmetry greatly depends on ΔE and phonon assisted mechanisms. In practice, a direct energy transfer via the Förster coupling is likely between two molecular states in a relative resonance ([formula]). An energy separation equivalent to [formula] between the s-shell resonances of the smaller and larger dots excludes such a direct tunneling mechanism ([formula]) in our QDM. We note that the s shell in [formula] is located in the vicinity of upper shells in [formula] (perhaps d shells), and this may promote an exciton transfer from the d shells of [formula] into the s shell of [formula] directly or via phonon-assisted coupling. Under such conditions, the dynamic pumping rate of the s shell in [formula], [formula], will increase as compared to [formula].

The important parameters used to model the measured cross correlations in the main text are compiled in Table [\ref=Table:par]. The model is incapable of comprising the excitation power [formula] and the PL intensity of resonances. The influence of the incoherent pumping is reflected in the pump rate of transitions ([formula] holds for a typical laser transition, however we repudiate such exact proportionality for quantum dot transitions). We found that [formula] or [formula] cannot grow fast and must be sufficiently smaller than [formula] or [formula], to precisely fit to the bunching peaks of [formula] and [formula] measured correlation. For simplicity, we presumed [formula] but their ratio can be similar to [formula]. As inferred from Table [\ref=Table:par], [formula] and [formula] are enhanced super-linearly while [formula] and [formula] grow linearly, which agrees with our method of power amplification in practice (see ). It is not feasible to pinpoint the exact values of pumping rates due to the many parameters involved and the approximative nature of our model. The impact of detector was introduced into the correlations through convolving them with a Guassian lineshape: [formula], where [formula] is the APD temporal resolution.

The model given above merely accounts for the radiative excitation of neutral states and neglects the formation of charged particles that can affect the neutrality of quantum dots through nonradiative mechanisms. Moreover, the model does not directly incorporate the PL intensity of spectral lines. However, putting the accuracy of parameters aside, the model is qualitatively in a very good agreement with our experimental results approving the suppression of bunching visibility of a triple cascade in QDMs.

Triple coincidence counts

To further clarify the peculiarities seen in the triple coincidence histogram plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:CC]d in the main text, we simulated the three-photon correlations numerically. To comply with the observations, we assumed that [formula] serves as the Start signal while [formula] and [formula] function as Stop1 and Stop2, respectively. The temporal characteristics are treated consistent with the experiment. We model three different scenarios: first, three uncorrelated single photon sources of the same brightness and recombination energy as [formula], [formula] and [formula] are considered. Poissonian noise on every individual channel was taken into account to mimic a realistic counting experiment. The triple coincidence histogram is plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:sub_corr](a), where fully random contributions from the three photons form the background level (by average 319 counts). In the second (third) case, we correlate the measured twofold coincidences of [formula] and [formula] ([formula]) with uncorrelated [formula] ([formula]) signal. The outcome reproduces the so-called "bunching walls" superimposed on top of the fully accidental events, see Fig. [\ref=fig:sub_corr](b-c). These features are partially correlated and clearly observed as the dual-channel bunching along τ31 and τ21 axes in Fig. [\ref=fig:CC]d in the main text. The third bunching wall in the experimental plot (not simulated here) originates from twofold correlations of [formula] and [formula] with [formula] being random. The threefold coincidence peak sits at the intersection of these three bunching features.
