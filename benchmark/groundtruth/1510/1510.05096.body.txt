Pseudocompactness, products and topological Brandt λ0-extensions of semitopological monoids

Introduction and preliminaries

Further we shall follow the terminology of [\cite=CHK] [\cite=CliffordPreston1961-1967] [\cite=Engelking1989] [\cite=Petrich1984] [\cite=Ruppert1984]. By [formula] we shall denote the set of all positive integers.

A semigroup is a non-empty set with a binary associative operation. A semigroup S is called inverse if for any x∈S there exists a unique y∈S such that x  ·  y  ·  x = x and y  ·  x  ·  y = y. Such the element y in S is called inverse to x and is denoted by x- 1. The map assigning to each element x of an inverse semigroup S its inverse x- 1 is called the inversion.

For a semigroup S by E(S) we denote the subset of idempotents of S, and by S1 (resp., S0) we denote the semigroup S the adjoined unit (resp., zero) (see [\cite=CliffordPreston1961-1967]). Also if a semigroup S has zero 0S, then for any A  ⊆  S we denote [formula].

For a semilattice E the semilattice operation on E determines the partial order [formula] on E:

[formula]

This order is called natural. An element e of a partially ordered set X is called minimal if [formula] implies f = e for f∈X. An idempotent e of a semigroup S without zero (with zero) is called primitive if e is a minimal element in E(S) (in (E(S))*).

Let S be a semigroup with zero and [formula] be a cardinal. On the set [formula] we define a semigroup operation as follows

[formula]

and (α,a,β)  ·  0 = 0  ·  (α,a,β) = 0  ·  0 = 0, for all α,β,γ,δ∈λ and a,b∈S. If S is a monoid, then the semigroup Bλ(S) is called the Brandt λ-extension of the semigroup S [\cite=Gutik1999]. Obviously, [formula] is the zero of S} is an ideal of Bλ(S). We put B0λ(S) = Bλ(S) / J and we shall call B0λ(S) the Brandt λ0-extension of the semigroup S with zero [\cite=GutikPavlyk2006]. Further, if A  ⊆  S then we shall denote Aα,β  =  {(α,s,β):s∈A} if A does not contain zero, and [formula] if 0∈A, for α,β∈λ. If I is a trivial semigroup (i.e., I contains only one element), then by I0 we denote the semigroup I with the adjoined zero. Obviously, for any [formula] the Brandt λ0-extension of the semigroup I0 is isomorphic to the semigroup of λ  ×  λ-matrix units and any Brandt λ0-extension of a semigroup with zero contains the semigroup of λ  ×  λ-matrix units. Further by Bλ we shall denote the semigroup of λ  ×  λ-matrix units and by B0λ(1) the subsemigroup of λ  ×  λ-matrix units of the Brandt λ0-extension of a monoid S with zero.

A semigroup S with zero is called 0-simple if {0} and S are its only ideals and S2  ≠  {0}, and completely 0-simple if it is 0-simple and has a primitive idempotent [\cite=CliffordPreston1961-1967]. A completely 0-simple inverse semigroup is called a Brandt semigroup [\cite=Petrich1984]. By Theorem II.3.5 [\cite=Petrich1984], a semigroup S is a Brandt semigroup if and only if S is isomorphic to a Brandt λ-extension Bλ(G) of a group G.

A non-trivial inverse semigroup is called a primitive inverse semigroup if all its non-zero idempotents are primitive [\cite=Petrich1984]. A semigroup S is a primitive inverse semigroup if and only if S is an orthogonal sum of Brandt semigroups [\cite=Petrich1984].

In this paper all topological spaces are Hausdorff. If Y is a subspace of a topological space X and A  ⊆  Y, then by [formula] and [formula] we denote the topological closure and interior of A in Y, respectively.

A subset A of a topological space X is called regular open if [formula].

We recall that a topological space X is said to be

semiregular if X has a base consisting of regular open subsets;

compact if each open cover of X has a finite subcover;

sequentially compact if each sequence [formula] of X has a convergent subsequence in X;

ω-bounded if every countably infinite set in X has the compact closure [\cite=GuldenFleischmanWeston1970];

totally countably compact if every countably infinite set in X contains an infinite subset with the compact closure [\cite=Frolik1960];

countably compact if each open countable cover of X has a finite subcover;

countably compact at a subset A  ⊆  X if every infinite subset B  ⊆  A has an accumulation point x in X;

countably pracompact if there exists a dense subset A in X such that X is countably compact at A [\cite=Arkhangelskii1992];

sequentially pseudocompact if for each sequence [formula] of non-empty open subsets of the space X there exist a point x∈X and an infinite set [formula] such that for each neighborhood U of the point x the set [formula] is finite [\cite=GutikRavsky2014??];

H-closed if X is Hausdorff and X is a closed subspace of every Hausdorff space in which it is contained [\cite=AlexandroffUrysohn1929];

pseudocompact if each locally finite open cover of X is finite.

According to Theorem 3.10.22 of [\cite=Engelking1989], a Tychonoff topological space X is pseudocompact if and only if each continuous real-valued function on X is bounded. Also, a Hausdorff topological space X is pseudocompact if and only if every locally finite family of non-empty open subsets of X is finite. Every compact space and every sequentially compact space are countably compact, every countably compact space is countably pracompact, and every countably pracompact space is pseudocompact (see [\cite=Arkhangelskii1992]). We observe that pseudocompact spaces in topological literature also are called lightly compact or feebly compact (see [\cite=Bagley-Connelly-McKnight-1958] [\cite=Fernandez-Tkachenko-2014] [\cite=Sanchis-Tkachenko-2012]).

We recall that the Stone-ech compactification of a Tychonoff space X is a compact Hausdorff space βX containing X as a dense subspace so that each continuous map f:X  →  Y to a compact Hausdorff space Y extends to a continuous map [formula] [\cite=Engelking1989].

A (semi)topological semigroup is a Hausdorff topological space with a (separately) continuous semigroup operation. A topological semigroup which is an inverse semigroup is called an inverse topological semigroup. A topological inverse semigroup is an inverse topological semigroup with continuous inversion. We observe that the inversion on a topological inverse semigroup is a homeomorphism (see [\cite=EberhartSelden1969]). A Hausdorff topology τ on a (inverse) semigroup S is called (inverse) semigroup if (S,τ) is a topological (inverse) semigroup. A paratopological (semitopological) group is a Hausdorff topological space with a jointly (separately) continuous group operation. A paratopological group with continuous inversion is a topological group.

Let [formula] be a class of semitopological semigroups.

Let [formula] be a cardinal and [formula] be a semitopological monoid with zero. Let τB be a topology on Bλ(S) such that

[formula];   and

for some α∈λ the topological subspace (Sα,α,τB|Sα,α) is naturally homeomorphic to (S,τ).

Then [formula] is called a topological Brandt λ-extension of (S,τ) in [formula].

Let [formula] be a cardinal and [formula]. Let τB be a topology on B0λ(S) such that

[formula];

the topological subspace (Sα,α,τB|Sα,α) is naturally homeomorphic to (S,τ) for some α∈λ.

Then [formula] is called a topological Brandt λ0-extension of (S,τ) in [formula].

Later, if [formula] coincides with the class of all semitopological semigroups we shall say that [formula] (resp., [formula]) is called a topological Brandt λ0-extension (resp., a topological Brandt λ-extension) of (S,τ).

Algebraic properties of Brandt λ0-extensions of monoids with zero, non-trivial homomorphisms between them, and a category whose objects are ingredients of the construction of such extensions were described in [\cite=GutikRepovs2010]. Also, in [\cite=GutikPavlykReiter2009] and [\cite=GutikRepovs2010] a category whose objects are ingredients in the constructions of finite (resp., compact, countably compact) topological Brandt λ0-extensions of topological monoids with zeros were described.

Gutik and Repov proved that any 0-simple countably compact topological inverse semigroup is topologically isomorphic to a topological Brandt λ-extension Bλ(H) of a countably compact topological group H in the class of all topological inverse semigroups for some finite cardinal [formula] [\cite=GutikRepovs2007]. Also, every 0-simple pseudocompact topological inverse semigroup is topologically isomorphic to a topological Brandt λ-extension Bλ(H) of a pseudocompact topological group H in the class of all topological inverse semigroups for some finite cardinal [formula] [\cite=GutikPavlykReiter2011]. Next Gutik and Repov showed in [\cite=GutikRepovs2007] that the Stone-ech compactification β(T) of a 0-simple countably compact topological inverse semigroup T has a natural structure of a 0-simple compact topological inverse semigroup. It was proved in [\cite=GutikPavlykReiter2011] that the same is true for 0-simple pseudocompact topological inverse semigroups.

In the paper [\cite=BerezovskiGutikPavlyk2010] the structure of compact and countably compact primitive topological inverse semigroups was described and was showed that any countably compact primitive topological inverse semigroup embeds into a compact primitive topological inverse semigroup.

Comfort and Ross in [\cite=ComfortRoss1966] proved that a Tychonoff product of an arbitrary non-empty family of pseudocompact topological groups is a pseudocompact topological group. Also, they proved there that the Stone-ech compactification of a pseudocompact topological group has a natural structure of a compact topological group. Ravsky in [\cite=Ravsky-arxiv1003.5343v5] generalized Comfort-Ross Theorem and proved that a Tychonoff product of an arbitrary non-empty family of pseudocompact paratopological groups is pseudocompact.

In the paper [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013] it is described the structure of pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroups and it is shown that the Tychonoff product of an arbitrary non-empty family of pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroups is pseudocompact. Also, there is proved that the Stone-ech compactification of a pseudocompact primitive topological inverse semigroup has a natural structure of a compact primitive topological inverse semigroup.

In the paper [\cite=GutikRavsky2013??] we studied the structure of inverse primitive pseudocompact semitopological and topological semigroups. We find conditions when a maximal subgroup of an inverse primitive pseudocompact semitopological semigroup S is a closed subset of S and described the topological structure of such semiregular semigroup. Also there we described structure of pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extensions of topological semigroups and semiregular (quasi-regular) primitive inverse topological semigroups. In [\cite=GutikRavsky2013??] we shown that the inversion in a quasi-regular primitive inverse pseudocompact topological semigroup is continuous. Also there, an analogue of Comfort-Ross Theorem is proved for such semigroups: the Tychonoff product of an arbitrary non-empty family of primitive inverse semiregular pseudocompact semitopological semigroups with closed maximal subgroups is a pseudocompact space, and we described the structure of the Stone-ech compactification of a Hausdorff primitive inverse countably compact semitopological semigroup S such that every maximal subgroup of S is a topological group.

In this paper we study the preserving of Tychonoff products of the pseudocompactness (resp., countable compactness, sequential compactness, ω-boundedness, totally countable compactness, countable pracompactness, sequential pseudocompactness) by pseudocompact (and countably compact) topological Brandt λ0i-extensions of semitopological semitopological monoids with zero. In particular we show that if [formula] is a family of Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of pseudocompact semitopological monoids with zero such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a pseudocompact space, then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological semigroup.

Tychonoff products of pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extensions of semitopological semigroups

Later we need the following theorem from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a]:

For any Hausdorff countably compact semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero and for any cardinal [formula] there exists a unique Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups, and the topology τSB is generated by the base [formula], where:

[formula], where t = (α,s,β) is a non-zero element of B0λ(S), α,β∈λ;

[formula] and [formula], where 0 is the zero of B0λ(S),

and [formula] is a base of the topology τ at the point s∈S.

For any Hausdorff sequentially compact semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero and for any cardinal [formula] the Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups is a sequentially compact space.

In the case when λ  <  ω the statement of the lemma follows from Theorems 3.10.32 and 3.10.34 from [\cite=Engelking1989].

Next we suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] be the one point Alexandroff compactification of the discrete space of cardinality λ. Then [formula] is scattered because [formula] has only one non-isolated point, and hence by Theorem 5.7 from [\cite=VaughanHSTT] the space [formula] is sequentially compact. Since cardinal λ is infinite without loss of generality we can assume that λ  =  λ  ·  λ and hence we can identify the space [formula] with [formula]. Then by Theorem 3.10.35 from [\cite=Engelking1989] the space [formula] is sequentially compact. Later we assume that a is non-isolated point of the space [formula]. We define the map [formula] by the formulae Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.1] implies that so defined map g is continuous and hence by Theorem 3.10.32 of [\cite=Engelking1989] we get that the topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups is a sequentially compact space.

Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.2] and Theorem 3.10.35 from [\cite=Engelking1989] imply the following theorem:

Let [formula] be a countable family of Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of sequentially compact Hausdorff semitopological monoids. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff sequentially compact semitopological semigroup.

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of countably compact Hausdorff semitopological monoids such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a countably compact space. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff countably compact semitopological semigroup.

For every infinite cardinal λi, [formula], we shall repeat the construction proposed in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.2]. Let [formula] be the one point Alexandroff compactification of the discrete space of cardinality λi. Since cardinal λi is infinite without loss of generality we can assume that λi  =  λi  ·  λi and hence we can identify the space [formula] with [formula]. Later we assume that ai is non-isolated point of the space [formula]. We define the map [formula] by the formulae

[formula]

where 0i and 0Si are zeros of the semigroup B0λi(Si) and the monoid Si, respectively. Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.1] implies that so defined map gi is continuous.

In the case when cardinal λi, [formula], is finite we put [formula] is the discrete space of cardinality λ2i + 1 with the fixed point [formula]. Next we define the map [formula] by the formulae ([\ref=eq-1]), where 0i and 0Si are zeros of the semigroup B0λi(Si) and the monoid Si, respectively. It is obviously that such defined map gi is continuous. Then the space [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula] and hence by Theorem 3.2.4 and Corollary 3.10.14 from [\cite=Engelking1989] the Tychonoff product [formula] is countably compact. Later we define the map [formula] by putting [formula]. Since for any [formula] the map [formula] is continuous, Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.1] and Proposition 2.3.6 of [\cite=Engelking1989] imply that g is continuous too. Therefore by Theorem 3.10.5 from [\cite=Engelking1989] we obtain that the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff countably compact semitopological semigroup.

For any Hausdorff totally countably compact semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero and for any cardinal [formula] the Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups is a totally countably compact space.

In the case when λ  <  ω the statement of the lemma is trivial. So we suppose that [formula].

Let A be an arbitrary countably infinite subset of [formula]. Put [formula]. If the set [formula] is finite then total countable compactness of the space (S,τ) and Lemma 2 of [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] imply the statement of the lemma. So we suppose that the set [formula] is infinite. For each pair of indices [formula] choose a point [formula] and put [formula]. Then the definition of the topology τSB on B0λ(S) implies that K is a compact subset of the [formula] and [formula] is infinite. This completes the proof of the lemma.

Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.5] and Theorem 4.3 from [\cite=Frolik1960] imply the following theorem:

Let [formula] be a countable family of Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of totally countably compact Hausdorff semitopological monoids. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff totally countably compact semitopological semigroup.

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff totally countably compact semitopological monoids such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a totally countably compact space. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a totally countably compact semitopological semigroup.

Let for every [formula], [formula] be a space and [formula] be a map defined in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.4]. Also, Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.1] implies that the map gi is continuous for every [formula]. Since the space [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula] and Theorem 4.3 from [\cite=Frolik1960] we see that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a totally countably compact space. Then by Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.1] and Proposition 2.3.6 of [\cite=Engelking1989] the map [formula] defined by the formula [formula] is continuous. Simple verification imply that a continuous image of a totally countably compact space is a totally countably compact space too. Hence the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a totally countably compact semitopological semigroup.

Similarly to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.5] we can prove the following

For any Hausdorff ω-bounded semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero and for any cardinal [formula] the Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups is an ω-bounded space.

Since by Lemma 4 of [\cite=GuldenFleischmanWeston1970] the Tychonoff product of an arbitrary non-empty family of ω-bounded spaces is an ω-bounded space, similarly to the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.7] we can prove the following

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff countably compact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff ω-bounded semitopological monoids. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is an ω-bounded semitopological semigroup.

Theorems [\ref=theorem-2.1] and [\ref=theorem-2.9] imply the following:

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff totally countably compact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff ω-bounded semitopological monoids. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is an ω-bounded semitopological semigroup.

Later we shall use the following theorem from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a]:

For any semiregular pseudocompact semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero and for any cardinal [formula] there exists a unique semiregular pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups, and the topology τSB is generated by the base [formula], where:

[formula], where t = (α,s,β) is a non-zero element of B0λ(S), α,β∈λ;

[formula] and [formula], where 0 is the zero of B0λ(S),

and [formula] is a base of the topology τ at the point s∈S.

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of semiregular pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of semiregular pseudocompact semitopological monoids such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a pseudocompact space. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a semiregular pseudocompact semitopological semigroup.

Since by Lemma 20 from [\cite=Ravsky-arxiv1003.5343v5] the Tychonoff product of regular open sets is regular open we obtain that Tychonoff product of semiregular topological spaces is semiregular.

Let for every [formula], [formula] be a space and [formula] be the map defined in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.4]. Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.11] implies that the map gi is continuous for every [formula]. Since the space [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula], Theorem 3.2.4 from [\cite=Engelking1989] and Corollary 3.3 [\cite=GutikRavsky2013??] imply that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a pseudocompact space. Then by Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.11] and Proposition 2.3.6 of [\cite=Engelking1989] the map [formula] defined by the formula [formula] is continuous, and hence the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a semiregular pseudocompact semitopological semigroup.

Let X,Y be Hausdorff countably pracompact spaces. Then the product X  ×  Y is countably pracompact provided Y is a k-space or sequentially compact.

Let the space X be countably compact at its dense subset DX and the space Y be countably compact at its dense subset DY. The set DX  ×  DY is a dense subset of the space X  ×  Y. We claim that the space X  ×  Y is countably compact at the set DX  ×  DY. Indeed, let A = {(xs,ys):s∈S} be an infinite subset of the set DX  ×  DY such that (xs,ys)  ≠  (xs',ys') provided s  ≠  s'. Assume that the set A has no accumulation point in the space X.

If Y is a k-space then Lemma 3.10.12 from [\cite=Engelking1989] implies that there exists an infinite subset S0  ⊂  S such that either the set {xs:s∈S0} or the set {ys:s∈S0} has no accumulation point. Then this set is finite. Without loss of generality, we can assume that there are a point x∈X and an infinite subset S1 of the set S0 such that xs = x for each index s∈S1. Since the space Y is countably compact at the set DY, there exists an accumulation point y∈Y of the set {ys:s∈S1}. Then the point (x,y) is an accumulation point of the set {(xs,ys):s∈S1}, a contradiction.

If Y is a sequentially compact space then the proof of the claim is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.10.36 from [\cite=Engelking1989].

Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.13] implies the following corollary:

The product X  ×  Y of Hausdorff countably pracompact space X and compactum Y is countably pracompact.

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of semiregular countably pracompact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of countably pracompact semiregular semitopological monoids such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a countably pracompact space. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a semiregular countably pracompact semitopological semigroup.

Let for every [formula], [formula] be a space and [formula] be a map defined in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.4]. Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.11] implies that the map gi is continuous for every [formula]. Since the space [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula], Theorem 3.2.4 from [\cite=Engelking1989] and Corollary [\ref=corollary-2.14] imply that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a countably pracompact space. Then by Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.11] and Proposition 2.3.6 of [\cite=Engelking1989] the map [formula] defined by the formula [formula] is continuous, and since by Lemma 8 from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] every continuous image of a countably pracompact space is countably pracompact, we see that the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a semiregular pseudocompact semitopological semigroup.

Since for any semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero and for any finite cardinal [formula] there exists a unique topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the class of semitopological semigroups, the proof of the following theorem is similar to the proofs of Theorems [\ref=theorem-2.12] and [\ref=theorem-2.15].

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) semitopological monoids such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) space and every cardinal λi, [formula], is non-zero and finite. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) semitopological semigroup.

By Theorem 2.19 of [\cite=GutikRavsky2013??] we have that a topological Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of a topological monoid (S,τS) with zero in the class of Hausdorff topological semigroups is pseudocompact if and only if cardinal λ is finite and the space (S,τS) is pseudocompact. Hence Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.16] and Theorem 2.19 of [\cite=GutikRavsky2013??] imply the following:

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) topological monoids in the class of Hausdorff topological semigroups such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) space. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff pseudocompact (countably pracompact) topological semigroup.

The following lemma describes the main property of a base of the topology at zero of a Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension of a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological monoid in the class of Hausdorff semitopological semigroups.

Let [formula] be any Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension of a pseudocompact semitopological monoid (S,τ) with zero in the class of semitopological semigroups. Then for every open neighbourhood U(0) of zero 0 in [formula] there exist at most finitely many pairs of indices [formula] such that [formula] for any [formula].

Suppose to the contrary: there exist an open neighbourhood V(0) of zero 0 in [formula] and infinitely many pairs of indices [formula] such that [formula] for every positive integer i. Then by Proposition 1.1.1 of [\cite=Engelking1989] for every positive integer i there exists a non-empty open subset Wαi,βi in [formula] such that Wαi,βi  ⊆  S*αi,βi and [formula]. Hence by Lemma 3 of [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] we have that [formula] is an infinite locally finite family in [formula] which contradicts the pseudocompactness of the space [formula]. The obtained contradiction implies the statement of our lemma.

Given a topological space (X,τ) Stone [\cite=Stone1937] and Kattov [\cite=Katetov] consider the topology τr on X generated by the base consisting of all regular open sets of the space (X,τ). This topology is called the regularization of the topology τ. It is easy to see that if (X,τ) is a Hausdorff topological space then (X,τr) is a semiregular topological space.

Let (S,τ) be any semitopological monoid with zero. Then for any infinite cardinal λ we define a topology τSB on the Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (S,τ) in the following way. The topology τSB is generated by the base [formula], where:

[formula], where t = (α,s,β) is a non-zero element of B0λ(S), α,β∈λ;

[formula] and [formula], where 0 is the zero of B0λ(S),

and [formula] is a base of the topology τ at the point s∈S.

We observe that the space [formula] is Hausdorff (resp., regular, Tychonoff, normal) if and only if the space (S,τ) is Hausdorff (resp., regular, Tychonoff, normal) (see: Propositions 21 and 22 in [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a]).

Let λ be any infinite cardinal. If (S,τ) is a Hausdorff semitopological monoid with zero then [formula] is a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup. Moreover, the space (S,τ) is pseudocompact if and only if so is [formula].

The Hausdorffness of the space [formula] follows from Proposition 21 from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a].

Let a and b are arbitrary elements of S and W(ab), U(a), V(b) be arbitrary open neighborhoods of the elements ab, a and b, respectively, such that U(a)  ·  b  ⊆  W(ab) and a  ·  V(b)  ⊆  W(ab). Then we have that the following conditions hold:

(U(a))α,β  ·  (β,b,γ)  ⊆  (W(ab))α,γ;

(α,a,β)  ·  (V(b))β,γ  ⊆  (W(ab))α,γ;

if β  ≠  γ then (U(a))α,β  ·  (γ,b,δ) = {0}  ⊆  WA(0) and (α,a,β)  ·  (V(b))γ,δ  =  {0}  ⊆  WA(0) for every finite subset A of λ  ×  λ and every [formula];

WA(0)  ·  0 = {0}  ⊆  WA(0) and 0  ·  WA(0) = {0}  ⊆  WA(0) for every finite subset A of λ  ×  λ and every [formula];

(U(a))α,β  ·  0 = {0}  ⊆  WA(0) and 0  ·  (V(b))β,γ  =  {0}  ⊆  WA(0) for every finite subset A of λ  ×  λ and every [formula];

(α,a,β)  ·  VB(0)  ⊆  WA(0) for every finite subset [formula] and every [formula], where [formula] and [formula];

VB(0)  ·  (α,a,β)  ⊆  WA(0) for every finite subset [formula] and every [formula], where [formula] and [formula],

for each α,β,γ,δ∈λ. This completes the proof of separate continuity of the semigroup operation in [formula].

The implication (⇐) of the last statement follows from Lemma 9 of [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a]. To show the converse implication assume that [formula] is any locally finite family of open subsets of [formula]. Without loss of generality we can assume that 0∉Ui for any [formula]. Then the definition of the base of the topology τSB at zero implies that there exists a finite family of pairs of indices [formula] such that almost all elements of the family [formula] are contained in the set [formula]. Since a union of a finite family of pseudocompact spaces is pseudocompact, [formula] with the topology induced from [formula] is pseudocompact space. This implies that the family [formula] is finite.

Let λ be any infinite cardinal. Let (S,τS) be a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological monoid with zero 0S and [formula] be a pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension of (S,τS) in the class of Hausdorff semitopological semigroups.

For every open neighbourhood U(0) of zero in [formula] we put

Let [formula] be the natural homomorphisms, where is an ideal of the semigroup Bλ(S).

We generate a topology BS on the Brandt λ-extension Bλ(S) by a base [formula], where:

[formula], for all s∈S and α,β∈λ;

[formula] at zero 0 of [formula],

and [formula] is a base of the topology τ at the point s∈S.

Let λ be any infinite cardinal. Let [formula] be a pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension of a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological monoid with zero (S,τS) in the class of Hausdorff semitopological semigroup. Then [formula] is a Hausdorff semitopological semigroup. Moreover, the space (S,τ) is pseudocompact if and only if so is [formula].

We observe that simple verifications show that the natural homomorphism [formula] is a continuous map.

Let a and b be arbitrary elements of the semitopological semigroup (S,τS) and W(ab), U(a), V(b) be arbitrary open neighborhoods of the elements ab, a and b, respectively, such that U(a)  ·  b  ⊆  W(ab) and a  ·  V(b)  ⊆  W(ab). Then the following conditions hold:

(U(a))α,β  ·  (β,b,γ)  ⊆  (W(ab))α,γ;

(α,a,β)  ·  (V(b))β,γ  ⊆  (W(ab))α,γ;

if β  ≠  γ then (U(a))α,β  ·  (γ,b,δ) = {0}  ⊆  Uπ(0) and (α,a,β)  ·  (V(b))γ,δ  =  {0}  ⊆  Uπ(0) for every open neighbourhood U(0) of zero in [formula];

Uπ(0)  ·  0 = {0}  ⊆  Uπ(0) and 0  ·  Uπ(0) = {0}  ⊆  Uπ(0) for every open neighbourhood U(0) of zero in [formula];

(U(a))α,β  ·  0 = {0}  ⊆  Uπ(0) and 0  ·  (V(b))β,γ  =  {0}  ⊆  Uπ(0) for every open neighbourhood U(0) of zero in [formula];

(α,a,β)  ·  Uπ(0)  ⊆  Wπ(0) in [formula] for Uπ(0),Wπ(0)∈B(0)< where U(0) and W(0) are elements of a base of the topology τ0BS at zero 0 of B0λ(S) such that (α,a,β)  ·  U(0)  ⊆  W(0);

Uπ(0)  ·  (α,a,β)  ⊆  Wπ(0) in [formula] for Uπ(0),Wπ(0)∈B(0)< where U(0) and W(0) are elements of a base of the topology τ0BS at zero 0 of B0λ(S) such that U(0)  ·  (α,a,β)  ⊆  W(0),

for each α,β,γ,δ∈λ.

The proof of the last statement is similar to the proof of the second statement of Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.20].

Also, we may consider the semitopological semigroup [formula] as a topological Brandt λ0-extension of a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological monoid [formula] with "new" isolated zero 0T.

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological monoids with zero such that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a pseudocompact space. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological semigroup.

We consider two cases: 1) λi is finite cardinal, and 2) λi is infinite cardinal, [formula].

1) Let [formula] be an index such that λi is infinite cardinal. Then we put B(Si) is the topology on the Brandt λi-extension Bλi(Si) defined in Example [\ref=example-2.21]. Then by Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.22], [formula] is a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological semigroup. By Remark [\ref=remark-2.23] we have that the semitopological semigroup [formula] is a topological Brandt λ0i-extension of a Hausdorff pseudocompact semitopological monoid [formula] with isolated zero 0Ti. By τi we denote the topology of the space Ti. Let τTiB be the topology on the Brandt λ0-extension [formula] of (Ti,τi) defined in Example [\ref=example-2.19]. Next we algebraically identify the semigroup B0λi(Ti) with the Brandt λi-extension Bλi(Si) and the topology τTiB on Bλi(Si) we shall denote by τSiB.

2) Let [formula] be an index such that λi is finite cardinal. We put [formula] with isolated zero 0Ti. It is obvious that the semitopological semigroup Ti is pseudocompact if and only if so is the space Si. Then by Theorem 7 from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] there exists the unique topological Brandt λ0i-extension [formula] of the semitopological monoid Ti in the class of semitopological semigroups. Also, Theorem 7 from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] implies that the topological space [formula] is homeomorphic to the topological sum of topological copies of the space Si and isolated zero, and hence we obtain that the space [formula] is pseudocompact if and only if so is the space Si. Next we algebraically identify the semigroup B0λi(Ti) with the Brandt λi-extension Bλi(Si) and the topology B(Ti) on Bλi(Si) we shall denote by B(Si). Also in this case (when λi is a finite cardinal) we put τSiB  =  B(Si).

Then the definitions of topologies B(Si) and τSiB on Bλi(Si) imply that for every index [formula] the identity map [formula] is continuous. Let τRB(Si) be the regularization of the topology B(Si) on Bλi(Si). Then the definition of the topology τSiB on Bλi(Si) implies that the identity map [formula] is continuous. Since the pseudocompactness is preserved by continuous maps we obtain that [formula] is a semiregular pseudocompact space (which is not necessarily a semitopological semigroup). Also, repeating the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem-2.12] for our case, we get that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a pseudocompact space. Then the Cartesian products [formula] and [formula] are continuous maps. This implies that [formula] is a pseudocompact space. Then by Lemma 20 of [\cite=Ravsky-arxiv1003.5343v5] the regularization of the product [formula] coincides with [formula] and hence by Lemma 3 of [\cite=Ravsky-arxiv1003.5343v5] we have that the space [formula] is pseudocompact.

Let [formula] be the natural homomorphism, where [formula] is an ideal of the semigroup Bλi(Si). Then the natural homomorphism [formula] is a continuous map. This implies that the product [formula] is a continuous map, and hence we get that the Tychonoff product [formula] is a pseudocompact space.

Each H-closed space is pseudocompact.

Let X be an H-closed space. Assume that the space X is not pseudocompact. Then there exists an infinite locally finite family [formula] of non-empty open subsets of the space X. Since the family [formula] is locally finite, each point x∈X has an open neighbourhood Ux intersecting only finitely many members of the family [formula]. Since the space X is H-closed and {Ux:x∈X} is an open cover of the space X, by Exercise 3.12.5(4) from [\cite=Engelking1989] (also see [\cite=AlexandroffUrysohn1929]) there exists a finite subset F of the space X such that [formula]. But then the set X, as the union of the finite family [formula] intersects only finitely many members of the family [formula], a contradiction.

Let λ be any cardinal [formula] and S be any semigroup. We shall say that a subset Φ  ⊂  B0λ(S) has the λ-finite property in B0λ(S), if [formula] is finite for all α,β∈λ and [formula], where 0 is zero of B0λ(S).

Let λ be an infinite cardinal and [formula] be the unit circle with the usual multiplication of complex numbers and the usual topology [formula]. It is obvious that [formula] is a topological group. The base of the topology [formula] on the Brandt semigroup [formula] we define as follows:

for every non-zero element (α,x,β) of the semigroup [formula] the family where [formula] is a base of the topology [formula] at the point [formula], is the base of the topology [formula] at [formula];

the family where is the base of the topology [formula] at zero [formula].

Simple verifications show that [formula] is a non-semiregular Hausdorff pseudocompact topological space for every infinite cardinal λ. Next we shall show that the semigroup operation on [formula] is separately continuous. The proof of the separate continuity of the semigroup operation in the cases 0  ·  0 and (α,x,β)  ·  (γ,y,δ), where α,β,γ,δ∈λ and [formula], is trivial, and hence we only consider the following cases:

For arbitrary α,β∈λ and [formula] we denote [formula] and put [formula] is a subset of [formula] such that [formula].

Fix an arbitrary non-zero element [formula]. Let Φ  ⊂  B0λ(S) be an arbitrary subset with the λ-finite property in B0λ(S). Since [formula] is a group, there exist subsets Υ,Ψ  ⊂  B0λ(S) with the λ-finite property in B0λ(S) such that

Then we have that and similarly for every [formula]. This completes the proof of separate continuity of the semigroup operation in [formula].

Next we shall show that the space [formula] is not countably pracompact. Suppose to the contrary: there exists a dense subset A in [formula] such that [formula] is countably compact at A. Then the definition of the topology [formula] implies that [formula] is a dense subset in [formula] for all α,β∈λ. We construct a subset [formula] in the following way. For all α,β∈λ we fix an arbitrary point [formula] and put [formula]. Then Φ is the subset with the λ-finite property in B0λ(S), and the definition of the topology [formula] on [formula] implies that Φ has no an accumulation point x in [formula], a contradiction.

Example [\ref=example-2.26] shows that there exists a Hausdorff non-semiregular pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension of a Hausdorff compact topological group with adjoined isolated zero which is not a countably pracompact space. Also, Example 18 from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] shows that there exists a Hausdorff non-semiregular pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension of a countable Hausdorff compact topological monoid with adjoined isolated zero which is not a countably compact space. But, as a counterpart for the H-closed case or the sequentially pseudocompact case we have the following

Let S be semitopological monoid with zero which is an H-closed (resp., a sequentially pseudocompact) space. Then every Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension B0λ(S) of S in the class of Hausdorff semitopological semigroup is an H-closed (resp., a sequentially pseudocompact) space.

First we consider the case when S an H-closed space. Suppose to the contrary that there exists a Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0-extension (B0λ(S),τB) of S in the class of Hausdorff semitopological semigroup such that (B0λ(S),τB) is not an H-closed space. Then there exists a Hausdorff topological space X which contains the topological (B0λ(S),τB) as a non-closed subspace. Without loss of generality we may assume that (B0λ(S),τB) is a dense subspace of X such that [formula]. Fix an arbitrary point [formula]. Then we have that [formula] for any open neighbourhood U(x) of the point x in X. Now, the Hausdorffness of X implies that there exist open neighbourhoods V(x) and V(0) of x and zero 0 of the semigroup B0λ(S) such that [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.18] we obtain that there exist at most finitely many pairs of indices [formula] such that [formula] for any [formula]. Hence by Corollary 1.1.2 of [\cite=Engelking1989], the neighbourhood V(x) intersects at most finitely many subsets Sα,β, α,β∈λ. Then by Lemma 2 of [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] we get that Sα,β is a closed subset of X for all α,β∈λ, and hence B0λ(S) is a closed subspace of X, a contradiction.

Next we suppose that S is a sequentially pseudocompact space. Let [formula] be any sequence of non-empty open subsets of the space B0λ(S). If there exists finitely many pairs of indices [formula] such that [formula] the sequential pseudocompactness of S and Lemma 2 from [\cite=GutikPavlyk2013a] imply that there exist a point [formula] and an infinite set [formula] such that for each neighborhood U(x) of the point x the set [formula] is finite. In the other case by Lemma [\ref=lemma-2.18] we get that there exists an infinite set [formula] such that for each neighborhood U(0) of zero 0 of the semigroup B0λ(S) the set [formula] is finite. This completes the proof of our lemma.

Since by Theorem 3 from [\cite=ChevalleyFrink1941] (see also Problem 3.12.5(d) in [\cite=Engelking1989]) the Tychonoff product of the non-empty family non-empty H-topological spaces is H-closed, and by Proposition 2.2 from [\cite=GutikRavsky2014??], the Tychonoff product of a non-empty family of non-empty sequentially pseudocompact spaces is sequentially pseudocompact Proposition [\ref=proposition-2.27] implies the following

Let [formula] be a non-empty family of Hausdorff pseudocompact topological Brandt λ0i-extension of Hausdorff H-closed (resp., a sequentially pseudocompact) semitopological monoids with zero. Then the direct product [formula] with the Tychonoff topology is a Hausdorff H-closed (resp., a sequentially pseudocompact) semitopological semigroup.
