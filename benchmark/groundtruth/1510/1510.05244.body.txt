Comment on "Comment on "Integrability of the Rabi Model""

It has been claimed [\cite=comment] that Braak's solution [\cite=Braak1] for the energy spectrum of the Rabi model

[formula]

is not complete. The claim is incorrect. Braak's solution [\cite=Braak1] [\cite=Braak2] is given by En  =  xn  -  g2  /  ω, where xn is the nth zero of the functions

[formula]

The coefficients Kn(x) is defined recursively by nKn  =  fn - 1(x)  Kn - 1  -  Kn - 2, with

[formula]

and initial conditions K0 = 1,K1(x) = f0(x).

The exceptional part of the energy spectrum is defined by the eigenvalues En = nω - g2  /  ω, i.e., those eigenvalues with xn  =  nω. Braak has shown that the condition Kn(nω) = 0 gives the doubly degenerate eigenvalues found by Judd [\cite=Judd]. This condition arises in a natural way from the pole structure in Braak's solution [\cite=Braak1]. In the Comment [\cite=comment] it was argued that the set of Juddian solutions is just a subset of the exceptional eigenvalues. Using a determinant method in the Bargmann space the authors obtained another infinite set of exceptional eigenvalues which are non-degenerate and pass through the points [formula] in the Δ - g plane. It was claimed that these lines are neglected in Braak's solution and thus that the solution is not complete.

However, this set of non-degenerate exceptional points has been discussed before (see, e.g., [\cite=Braak2] [\cite=MPS]). In particular, Braak has shown [\cite=Braak2] that these points also arise naturally from lifting the pole structure, this time in one of the functions G-(x) or G+(x). In Figure [\ref=fig] we show plots of the energy spectrum in the Δ-g plane obtained directly from the above solution. These plots are identical to those given in [\cite=comment]. The n closed loops correspond to the doubly degenerate Juddian points following from the condition Kn(nω) = 0. The other lines are the non-degenerate exceptional points also following directly from Braak's solution. The set of doubly degenerate Juddian points is particularly important as they have been shown to induce Dirac cones in the energy landscape of the driven Rabi model [\cite=cones].

In conclusion, it is already known that the set of doubly degenerate Juddian solutions is only a subset of all exceptional eigenvalues with the form En = nω - g2  /  ω in the energy spectrum of the Rabi model. The set of non-degenerate solutions of this form discussed in [\cite=comment] also follows from Braak's solution. Therefore the claim that Braak's solution is not complete is incorrect.
