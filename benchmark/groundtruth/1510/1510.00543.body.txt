Weak measurements and the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion

Introduction

Precision measurements often encounter intrinsic limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. Understanding these limitations and designing strategies for achieving the ultimate precision by means of quantum resources is the objective of quantum metrology [\cite=Giovannetti04]. The framework for single-parameter estimation is well established, both for Hamiltonian parameters, phases in particular [\cite=Holland93] [\cite=Lee02] [\cite=Higgins07] [\cite=Brunn14], and for relevant cases of dissipative parameters [\cite=Monras07] [\cite=Adesso09].

Physical processes, though, show both unitary and dissipative dynamics. A possible approach is to treat dissipation as a stationary process, which can be characterised with arbitrary precision, and consider phase estimation through the dissipative environment [\cite=Dorner09] [\cite=Kacprowicz10] [\cite=Datta11] [\cite=Knysh11] [\cite=Brivio10] [\cite=Genoni11] [\cite=Genoni12] [\cite=Pinel13]. However, in the presence of non-stationary processes a more satisfactory approach consists in the joint estimation of the parameters linked to the unitary part and the evolution as well as to the dissipation. This requires tackling the problem with the formalism for multi-parameter estimation [\cite=Paris09]. Concerning the case above, when a first parameter is ascribed to a unitary and a second to the dissipation, this has been applied to the cases of phase and loss [\cite=Crowley14], and phase with phase diffusion [\cite=Knysh14] [\cite=Vidrighin14].

This latter case exemplifies the subtleties of multi-parameter estimation. It has been recognised that there is no fundamental impediment to achieving the best possible precision for the phase shift φ and the magnitude of the phase diffusion δ simultaneously, and specific instances have been exemplified [\cite=Knysh14]. However, in practical cases, such as with coherent states, a trade-off appears, of which one can not dispose of by using standard quantum resources  [\cite=Vidrighin14], such as N00N states or Holland-Burnett states [\cite=Holland93]. This limitation appears to be intimately related with the geometric representation of these states, and only by carefully tailoring the quantum state one can circumvent these limitations in particular limits [\cite=Knysh14].

In this paper, we address this issue in polarimetry, in which the description is effectively carried out in terms of two-level systems, considering weak-measurement strategies. Their interest is in the possibility of repeated measurement of non-commuting observables [\cite=Lundeen] [\cite=Howland]. There has been some debate on the scope of weak measurements in metrology, and on where they could offer some practical advantages [\cite=Dixon] [\cite=Hofmann] [\cite=Ferrie] [\cite=Knee] [\cite=Zhang] [\cite=Howell]. Here we analyse how well weak measurements can be employed for multi-parameter estimation, and show under which conditions they saturate the trade-off for the estimation of φ and δ with the best possible precision. The paper is structured as follows: in Sec. [\ref=s:theory] we present the theory behind multi-parameter estimation of phase and phase-diffusion, and its relationship with weak measurements. In Sec. [\ref=s:exp] we discuss an experimental realization of a weak measurement device based on an interferometric scheme, discussing its performances in the estimation of the two parameters of interest. We conclude the paper in Sec. [\ref=s:conclusions] with remarks and possible outlooks.

Theory

Our ideal estimation experiment is illustrated in Fig.[\ref=fig:1]. Polarised light passes through a sample, which imparts a birefringent phase; this is distributed around an average value φ, with a distribution whose variance is δ (which will be refereed to as phase diffusion for brevity). The output density matrix, generated by the action of the channel on the optimal probe [formula], can be written in the basis {|y±〉} on which the phase shift occurs as [\cite=Paris09] [\cite=Vidrighin14]:

[formula]

Although [formula] is diagonal, thus the parameters are in principle statistically independent, these can not be measured simultaneously at the quantum limit using a single two-level system, even when employing POVMs other than projectors and ensuring that no correlations between the two estimators arise [\cite=Vidrighin14]. This descends from the general result that in the multiparameter case the quantum Cramér-Rao bound is not tight, and may not be saturated [\cite=Paris09]. In fact, being [formula] the Fisher information matrix associated to any possible measurement operator on a two-level system, the following bound holds:

[formula]

Since in principle the right-hand side of Eqs. [\eqref=eq:1] and [\eqref=eq:bound2] can be as high as 2, this bound establishes that there exists no better strategy than using a fraction of the experimental runs to estimate the phase, and the rest for the phase diffusion, with a weighting giving the relative importance of the two parameters. A measurement saturating [\eqref=eq:1] is described by a rank-1 POVM, measuring along the eigenvectors of σx and σz. In this measurement strategy one can tune the relative weight of each parameter by tuning the probability of performing the σx or the σz measurement. We observe that this bound is related to a similar relation established in [\cite=MassarGill] for state estimation.

Weak measurements offer a different strategy for addressing this joint estimation problem. We can imagine a scheme in which σz is first measured weakly, and then σx is measured with a standard projection. The weak measurement provides on average an unbiased estimator [\cite=geoff], and although it always introduces a disturbance, this can be taken into account in the data analysis by means of some form of calibration, at the cost of a reduction of the attainable precision. We quantify the quality of this measurement by evaluating its Fisher information. To do so, we first introduce weak measurement operators in the form

[formula]

where σ0 is the 2  ×  2 identity matrix. The angle θ establishes the amount of information extracted in a single run, and it ranges from 0, corresponding to no measurement and no disturbance, to π / 2, corresponding to full projective measurement. These operators allow us to find the final detection probabilities using the modified Born's rule , and similarly in the other cases [\cite=geoff] [\cite=Iinuma]. Our goal here is to relate the Fisher information [formula] to the invasiveness parameters θ of the weak measurement; the Fisher information can be easily computed from the conditional probabilities {p( + , + ),p( + , - ),p( - , + ),p( - , - )} by using the formula

[formula]

In particular we obtain.

Direct substitution verifies that our weak measurement scheme always saturate, but can not beat the bound [\eqref=eq:1]. This fact can be understood by observing that the overall measurement operator, of the form M+  ·  (σ0  +  σx)  ·  M+, corresponds to a projector in the direction [formula] of the Bloch sphere, and similar expressions hold in the other cases, originating a symmetry around the y axis; thus, weak measurements are bound by the expression [\eqref=eq:1], and, indeed, saturate it (see the supplemental information of Ref. [\cite=Vidrighin14]). This bound, though, does not give prescriptions as to the behaviour of two-parameter estimation in terms of the strength of the weak measurement, a question which we address in the following.

The saturation of Eq.[\eqref=eq:1] does not ensure that the scheme can actually provide two estimators for φ and δ, both achieving the . This is because there might exist correlations between these two parameters introduced by the off-diagonal term Fδφ.

Experiment

We illustrate the concepts developed in the previous section via a characterisation of a a weak measurement device based on the interferometric scheme introduced by Iinuma and colleagues [\cite=Iinuma]. We perform a weak measurement of the Stokes parameter [formula] of a light beam, followed by a standard measurement of [formula]. We are then tackling the problem of estimating the linear polarisation direction, i.e. a phase shift in the basis of the circular polarisations, together with its associated noise.

A weak measurement necessitates an ancillary metre system to which the observable of interest is coupled. In the original experiment, the path inside a Mach-Zehender interferometer acts as the ancillary system: the beam is first split on a polarising beam splitter (PBS), and then recombined on a beam-splitter, after manipulation of the polarisation [\cite=Iinuma] [\cite=Iinuma2]. In our arrangement, both the initial and the final beam splitters of the interferometer are PBSs, and that makes it possible to adopt a stable Sagnac configuration, instead of the Mach-Zehender arrangement (Fig. 4a).

The input polarisation of a cw He:Ne laser is prepared by the first halfwaveplate (HWP1) as an arbitrary linear polarisation [formula]. The beam is then divided in two by a PBS, whose outputs constitute the two arms of the Sagnac interferometer. HWP2 is present on both modes, and it sets the measurement strength through its angle ω with respect the horizontal, while HWP3 is kept with its axis at [formula] to ensure that the two spatial modes are coupled differently to the polarisation. With this choice, the effect of the overall device on the polarisation is:

[formula]

for output 1, and

[formula]

for output 2. Therefore we obtain an implementation of the measurement operators [\eqref=operatori], up to a unitary; the orientation of the axis of HWP2 is linked to the setting of the measurement by [formula], which is set in our experiment to [formula], and approaches the strong regime. Due to technical limitations, we only consider a three-outcome measurement, without resolving σx on one of the outputs. This results in a slight decrease of the available Fisher information, but, notably, the correlations between the two parameters, which are our main interest for this investigation, remain unaffected.

As a first step, we perform a calibration of our device, by injecting pure states with known phases set by the angle of HWP1, and register the outcome probability. We then obtain calibration curves such as those in Fig. 4b, using an interpolation [\cite=nota]; arbitrary pairs of phase and dephasing can then be recovered by finding the values of φ and δ which are more compatible with these curves with a minimal residual approach. Following the technique in [\cite=qcontrol], in our experiment we have simulated the state [\eqref=stato] by injecting two pure states and adding the output signals with proper weighting. Figure [\ref=fig:5] reports the experimental values φ and δ obtained when varying the expected dephasing δ0. As expected, the estimated phase does not change with the amplitude of the dephasing, while we observe a small bias in the estimation of δ, due to the fact that the data sets have not the same intensity.

In a multiparameter estimation experiment, an important aspect is the manifestation of correlations between the estimated parameters. Since the main source of uncertainty in our experiment is the discretisation imposed by the intensity meter, a repetition of the experiment would not lead to an insight nor on the errors on each parameter, nor on their correlations. In order to obtain a visualisation of such uncertainties we have employed a Monte Carlo routine which simulates repetitions of the estimation experiment, by varying the intensity values within the range of the experimental uncertainties. This constitutes a simple and direct way to inspect the experimental covariance of the measured parameters. We then compare these histograms with the expected covariance Σ = F / M' for an ideal instrument. We emphasise that, due to the origin of the uncertainties in our measurement, the parameter M' should not be interpreted directly as an effective number of experiments, but as a scaling parameter to make the two figures comparable [\cite=note]. As expected, the shape of the correlations depends on the working value of δ0, and the trend is followed even in the presence of imperfections.

conclusions

We have discussed the performance of weak measurements as a scheme for the joint estimation of a phase parameter and the amplitude of contextual dephasing. We have illustrated how these measurements obey the same bound as all POVMs, and related the information obtained on the two parameters to the measurement setting. An experimental investigation has shown how these considerations remain valid qualitatively even in presence of experimental imperfections. Our results highlight how these measurements represent a practical scheme for such multiparameter scenario, but present no intrinsic advantage.
