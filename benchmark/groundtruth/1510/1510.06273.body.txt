On the uniform convergence of double sine series

Known results: uniform convergence of single sine series

Let {ck}∞k = 1 be a non-negative real sequence and consider the series

[formula]

In 1916 Chaundy and Jolliffe [\cite=CH&J] proved the following classical result.

Several classes of sequences have been introduced to generalize Theorem [\ref=T.1] (see [\cite=Z&Z&Y], [\cite=Y&Z], [\cite=K], [\cite=S]). These classes are larger than the class of monotone sequences and contain sequences of complex numbers as well. The definitions of the latest classes are the following:

[formula]

where Δrck = ck - ck + r for [formula], and the constants C and λ depend only on {ck}, a sequence [formula] is increasing and β: = (βk) is a non-negative sequence. It was proved in [\cite=K] that [formula] and a series ([\ref=1.1]) with coefficients of complex numbers from the classes MVBVS, SBVS, SBVS2, is uniformly convergent if ([\ref=1.2]) is satisfied. In [\cite=S] Szal showed that the class [formula], with [formula] (λ > 1) and r = 2 is larger than MVBVS and a series ([\ref=1.1]) with coefficients from [formula] is uniformly convergent if ([\ref=1.2]) holds. However, the necessity of condition ([\ref=1.2]) for the uniform convergence of ([\ref=1.1]) is proved for sine series with coefficients of non-negative numbers from one of the above classes.

Known results: uniform convergence of double sine series

We start this section by giving some definitions and notations.

A double series of complex numbers converge regularly if the sum converge to a finite number as m and n tend to infinity independently of each other, moreover, both the column series and row series are convergent. Or equivalently, if for any ε > 0 there exists a positive number m0 = m0(ε) such that holds for any m,n,M,N for which m + n > m0, 1  ≤  m  ≤  M and 1  ≤  n  ≤  N.

A monotonically decreasing double sequence {cjk}∞  j,k = 1 is a sequence of real numbers such that where

[formula]

Let {cjk}∞  j,k = 1 be a double sequence of complex numbers. Consider the double sine series

[formula]

The two-dimensional extension of Theorem [\ref=T.1] is due to Zak and Sneider.

Theorem [\ref=T.2] was generalized by Kórus and Móricz [\cite=2K&M] and by Kórus [\cite=2K] (and also by Leindler [\cite=L]). They have defined new classes of double sequences to obtain those generalizations. We present below those definitions and their results.

Now, we shall define a new class of double sequences in the following way: Let, for [formula], and

Using our definition for r = 1, we have:

In this paper we shall present some properties of the classes DGM(2α,2β,2γ,2) and DGM(3α,3β,3γ,2). Moreover, we generalize and extend the results of Kórus ([\cite=2K]) to the classes DGM(2α,2β,2γ,2) or DGM(3α,3β,3γ,2), respectively.

Auxiliary results

If [formula] is such that condition ([\ref=2.2]) and the inequality

[formula]

are satisfied, then

Set ε > 0 arbitrarily. By condition ([\ref=2.2]) and from the fact that {b(l)} tends monotonically to infinity, there exists an m1 = m1(ε) such that

[formula]

Then, by ([\ref=3.1]), assuming m + n > m1 and m,n  ≥  λ, we have

[formula]

since

[formula]

This complete the proof.

Let [formula] and the condition ([\ref=2.2]) is satisfied.

holds, then

holds, then

[formula] and [formula] or n  ≥  λ and [formula], respectively.

Set ε > 0 arbitrarily. By condition ([\ref=2.2]) and from the fact that {b(l)} tends monotonically to infinity, there exists an m1 = m1(ε) such that

[formula]

since

This implies that ([\ref=3.4]) holds.

Hence ([\ref=3.6]) is satisfied.

Now, our proof is complete.

If {cjk}∞j,k = 1 is a non-negative sequence belonging to the class DGM(2α,2β,2γ,2) with C, λ and {b1(l)}∞l = 1, {b2(l)}∞l = 1, {b3(l)}∞l = 1 then for any m,n  ≥  λ

[formula]

Let m,n  ≥  λ. If {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∈DGM(2α,2β,2γ,2), then for any v and m  ≤  μ  ≤  2m

[formula]

By an analogous argument, we get that for any μ and n  ≤  v  ≤  2n

[formula]

For μ, v such that m  ≤  μ  ≤  2m and n  ≤  v  ≤  2n we have

[formula]

and applying the inequality ([\ref=3.1]), we get

[formula]

Adding up all inequalities in ([\ref=3.9]) for [formula] and [formula] we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Analogously as in ([\ref=3.7]) and ([\ref=3.8]) we can obtain the following inequalities

[formula]

[formula]

Hence we get

[formula]

This ends the proof.

Denote, for [formula] and [formula] by

[formula]

the conjugated Dirichlet type kernel.

([\cite=S], [\cite=2S]) Let [formula] and [formula]. If [formula], then for all m  ≥  n

Let [formula] and [formula] such that m  ≤  M and n  ≤  N.

and if [formula], then for any [formula].

and if [formula], then for any [formula].

If [formula], then using inequality [formula] we obtain the following estimation:

From this we get

If [formula], then using inequality [formula] we have the estimation:

and consequently

for [formula], and

for [formula].

This ends the proof.

Main results

We have the following results:

Analogously as in Theorem [\ref=T.8], we can show:

Now, we formulate some remarks.

From Theorem [\ref=T.7], using Theorem [\ref=T.8] and Corollary [\ref=C.1], we obtain Theorem [\ref=T.5] and Theorem [\ref=T.4].

There exist [formula] and a sequence {cjk}∞j,k = 1 belonging to the class DGM(3α,3β,3γ,3), with the property ([\ref=2.2]), such that the series ([\ref=2.1]) is divergent in (x0,y0).

Remark [\ref=R.2] shows that the results from Theorem [\ref=T.7] are not true with r = 3 instead of r = 2.

Proof of the main results

In this section we shall prove our main results.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T.7]

are uniformly convergent since {cjn}∞  j = 1∈GM(3α,2) for any [formula] and {cmk}∞  k = 1∈GM(3β,2) for any [formula]. Let ε > 0 be arbitrarily fixed. We shall prove that for any M  ≥  m > η, N  ≥  n > η and any [formula] we have

where η  =  η(ε) > λ is the natural number which satisfies for any m,n > η The inequality ([\ref=5.2]) is trivial, when x = 0 and y is arbitrary or y = 0 and x is arbitrary. We have the same situation, if x = π and y is arbitrary or y = π and x is arbitrary. Suppose [formula], set [formula] and [formula], where ⌈  ·  ⌉ means the integer part of a real number. We have four cases:

and using Lemma [\ref=L.2] and ([\ref=2.2]) we get

and by Lemma [\ref=L.2] and ([\ref=2.2])

Using ([\ref=3.12]), ([\ref=2.2]) Lemma [\ref=L.1] and Lemma [\ref=L.2], we obtain

Let [formula] and [formula], set [formula] and [formula]. We have four cases:

Let [formula] and [formula], set [formula] and [formula]. Now, we have also four cases:

Finally, let [formula] and [formula], set [formula] and [formula]. Analogously as before we have four cases:

If we summarize all partial estimations we get ([\ref=5.2]), this ends the proof of part (i).

holds for any m + n > m0 and any (x,y). Set [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]  we have

Since {b1(l)}∞  l = 1, {b2(l)}∞  l = 1, {b3(l)}∞  l = 1 tends to infinity, there exists an m1 such that for any m, n: m + n > m1 implies m + n > m0, b1(m) + n > m0, m + b2(n) > m0 and b3(m + n) > m0. Then by ([\ref=5.3]) and Lemma [\ref=L.3], we have for m + n > m1

Next

and finally, we have Hence ([\ref=2.2]) is satisfied when j + k  →    ∞   and j,k  ≥  λ. If j  →    ∞   and k < λ or j < λ and k  →    ∞  , ([\ref=2.2]) follows from the uniform convergence of the series in ([\ref=5.1]). It completes the proof of part (ii). [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T.8]

and by ([\ref=2.9]), for m  ≥  λ and n  ≥  1,

Next, we get

Similarly as above, for n  ≥  λ and m  ≥  1,

Now, we have

and by ([\ref=2.11]), we obtain for m,n  ≥  λ

Finally, we get

We show that {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∈DGM(3α,3β,3γ,2). It easy to see that and

Similarly as above and By elementary calculations and

Therefore {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∈DGM(3α,3β,3γ,2). Now, we show that {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∉DGM(3α,3β,3γ,1). We have

Let [formula]. Then and since

the inequality does not hold, because [formula] as m  →    ∞  .

This ends the proof. [formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=C.1]

Let, for m  ≥  λ, [formula] if S2  ≤  S1 or [formula] if S1  ≤  S2. Then

for m  ≥  λ and n  ≥  1. Similarly as above

for n  ≥  λ and m  ≥  1. Finally, by ([\ref=5.6]) we get

for m,n  ≥  λ. From ([\ref=5.8]), ([\ref=5.9]) and ([\ref=5.10]) we get that {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∈DGM(2α,2β,2γ,2).

It completes the proof. [formula]

Proof of Remark [\ref=R.2]

Let cjk = aj  ·  ak, where for [formula] and [formula].

It is easy to see that ([\ref=2.2]) holds. Now, we shall prove that {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∈DGM(3α,3β,3γ,3). Let   and   Then we have

[formula]

Applying the Lagrange theorem, for the function y =  ln (x), there exists c∈(j + 4,j + 1) such that and

[formula]

Similarly as above

[formula]

By elementary calculations we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=5.11]), ([\ref=5.12]) and ([\ref=5.13]) we obtain that {cjk}∞  j,k = 1∈DGM(3α,3β,3γ,3).

Moreover, we have

[formula]

This ends the proof. [formula]
