Passive stabilization of hole spin qubit using optical Stark effect

Spins confined to self-assembled quantum dots are promising optically active qubits. Compared to the electron, there are strong reasons to believe that the spin of a heavy-hole [\cite=Economou_prb] [\cite=Muller_prb] [\cite=Fras_prb] [\cite=Ardelt_ArXiv] [\cite=Ramsay_prl] [\cite=Godden_apl] may make a more robust qubit [\cite=Heiss_prb] [\cite=Gerardot_nat]. The main source of dephasing for the electron spin is the contact hyperfine interaction leading to typical dephasing times of [formula], without the use of echo pulses [\cite=Press_nphoton]. However, for a heavy-hole with p-type Bloch-function, the contact hyperfine interaction is zero, suppressing the effective hyperfine interaction by a factor of about 10 [\cite=Fallahi_prl] [\cite=Chekhovich_prl] [\cite=Chekhovich_nphys]. In addition, the hyperfine interaction is highly anisotropic, and for an in-plane magnetic field, as used in coherent control experiments [\cite=DeGreve_nphys] [\cite=Godden_prl] [\cite=Greilich_nphoton] the effect of fluctuations in an out-of-plane effective nuclear magnetic field are further suppressed [\cite=Fischer_prb]. However, reported measurements of T*2 from Larmor precession of the hole-spin (3-20 ns [\cite=DeGreve_nphys] [\cite=Godden_prl] [\cite=Greilich_nphoton])or coherence population trapping (CPT) (>  100 ns) [\cite=Brunner_sci] vary considerably. The main source of extrinsic dephasing was attributed [\cite=DeGreve_nphys] [\cite=Greilich_nphoton] to charge noise acting on the E-field sensitive in-plane g-factor [\cite=Godden_prb] [\cite=Prechtel_prb] [\cite=Jovanov_prb], a view supported by recent studies of spin noise [\cite=Kuhlmann_nphys] and CPT [\cite=Houel_prl2014]. Methods to reduce the sensitivity of the hole Zeeman energy to charge noise are therefore desirable.

Recently, a number of experiments have demonstrated active stabilization of the emission frequency of a self-assembled quantum dot [\cite=Prechtel_prx] [\cite=Akopian_ArXiv] [\cite=Hansom_apl]. These are challenging experiments, where the bandwidth is limited by the signal strength. Another approach is to take advantage of the feedback between the Overhauser field and the optical pumping of the nuclear spin bath. This can result in the trion transition locking to a CW laser [\cite=Xu_nat] [\cite=Sun_prl] or the effective Zeeman energy locking to the repetition rate of a pulsed laser [\cite=Greilich_sci] [\cite=Greilich_prb] [\cite=Varwig_prb] [\cite=Varwig_prb2014]. In this work, I draw inspiration from work on Silicon quantum dots, where the qubit energy-splitting is engineered to be insensitive to the electric-field. One approach, proposed in refs. [\cite=Shi_prl] [\cite=Koh_prl] and recently demonstrated [\cite=Kim_ArXiv] is to use a hybrid qubit composed of three electron spins in a DQD. Another approach is to use a the AC-Stark shift induced by a CW microwave field to compensate for charge noise induced shifts in the qubit energy-splitting [\cite=Laucht_sciAdv] [\cite=Morello_talk]. Also note the work of Weiss et al [\cite=Weiss_prl] where the insensitivity of a singlet-triplet qubit to electric and magnetic fields at a 'sweet-spot' in an InAs double quantum dot leads to long extrinsic coherence times.

In this article, we propose the use of an AC-Stark shift induced by a CW laser to passively stabilize the hole Zeeman energy against charge noise, and thereby increase the extrinsic dephasing time T*2. A passive stabilization scheme benefits from experimental simplicity. The bandwidth is not limited by a measurement time. In the following, the principle will be explained, and calculations using typical dot parameters are presented where a factor of 10-100 improvement in T*2 is shown to be possible.

Consider a qubit encoded in the spin state of a heavy-hole confined to an InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot. To enable coherent control, a magnetic field B is applied in the sample plane. The energy-splitting of the qubit is given by the hole Zeeman energy, EhZ  =  gh(F)μBB, where [formula] is the Bohr magneton. The in-plane hole g-factor g(F) is a result of light-heavy hole mixing. It varies considerably from dot to dot [\cite=Schwan_apl1], is anisotropic [\cite=Schwan_apl2], and depends on the applied electric-field F [\cite=Greilich_nphoton] [\cite=Godden_prb] [\cite=Jovanov_prb] [\cite=Prechtel_prb]. As a result, fluctuations in the electric-field at the quantum dot due to charge noise, ΔF result in an extrinsic dephasing rate [formula]. To simplify the discussion, only fluctuations in the vertical electric-field are considered. In ref. [\cite=Houel_prl], shifts in the emission energy of quantum dots in a photodiode structure were attributed to charging of defect states at the AlGaAs/GaAs interface, which is typically [formula] above the quantum dot, justifying the approximation that the strongest E-field fluctuations are mostly along the vertical direction. Furthermore, the relatively weak E-field dependence of the in-plane electron g-factor [\cite=Prechtel_prb], and interactions with the nuclear spins are neglected.

The g-factor has been measured to be linear with vertical electric-field [\cite=Godden_prb] [\cite=Prechtel_prb] [\cite=Houel_prl2014], gh(F) = gh(0) + aF. In the following, quantum dot parameters measured in refs. [\cite=Godden_prl] [\cite=Godden_prb] are used. There a [formula] was measured at 4.7 T, for a quantum dot with [formula], from which we infer that the E-field fluctuations responsible for the extrinsic dephasing is [formula]. Values of gh(0) = 0.051 and ge = 0.46 are used. Our strategy is to use an AC-Stark shift [\cite=Xu_sci] [\cite=Jundt_prl] [\cite=Muller_prl2008] [\cite=Muller_prl2009] [\cite=Brash_prb] to reduce [formula] and hence the sensitivity to charge noise.

Figure 1(a) presents an energy level diagram of a 4-level heavy-hole/ positive trion system under an applied in-plane magnetic field along the x-direction. The case of an linearly x-polarized CW-laser is shown. The laser of Rabi energy Ω is strongly detuned from all of the optical transitions to avoid populating the trion states, Ω  ≪  |Δ(F)  ±  E±  Z|, where E±  Z(F) = (ge  ±  gh(F))μBB / 2 is the energy-splitting between the two optical transitions addressed by the + ( - ) = x(y) polarized laser. The laser induces an AC-Stark shift on both of the heavy-hole states, resulting in a shift in the hole Zeeman energy, ΔE±hZAC

[formula]

where ωL is the laser photon energy, ω0(F) is the mean energy of the excitonic transitions that depends on the E-field due to a permanent electric-dipole [formula] and an induced electric dipole [formula] [\cite=Fry_prl]. Δ(F) is the detuning between the laser and the mean of the optical transitions.

Figure [\ref=fig:energyvsF] illustrates the passive stabilization scheme. The red-trace shows the linear increase of the hole-Zeeman energy with electric-field without an applied laser, at a magnetic field of 5 T. The blue trace presents the AC-Stark shift to the Zeeman energy, for a moderate Rabi energy of [formula] and a detuning [formula]. Due to the quantum confined Stark effect, the optical transitions move through the laser, tuning the AC-Stark effect. The black trace presents the total hole-Zeeman energy EhZ = EhZ(F) + ΔE+hZAC. At an electric-field set-point of F0, there exists a turning-point in the energy where the hole-Zeeman energy is insensitive to fluctuations in the electric-field. The dashed-line provides an estimate of the extrinsic dephasing rate due to E-field fluctuations:

[formula]

At the 'sweet-spot' the dephasing rate drops by about 3 orders of magnitude. To summarize, the AC-Stark effect can be used to create a minimum in the hole-Zeeman energy versus electric-field where the hole-spin is insensitive to fluctuations in the E-field induced by charge noise.

However, there is a downside. Applying a laser introduces additional dephasing processes that need to be considered. Firstly, fluctuations in the laser power will introduce additional extrinsic dephasing:

[formula]

Secondly, the laser will generate some population in the trion states. When the trion radiatively recombines, to either hole spin state, the hole spin is randomized and this will act as a decoherence process. We estimate an upper limit on this dephasing to be [\cite=footnote]:

[formula]

where [formula] is a typical radiative recombination rate.

Figure [\ref=fig:dephasing] presents calculations of the contributions to extrinsic dephasing, optimized for detuning Δ0, versus Rabi energy, Ω, at a fixed electric-field of [formula]. We assume power fluctuations of 1% of total power, which is typical for a laser. Two distinct regimes are observed. At low power, the AC-Stark effect is too weak to compensate the E-field gradient of the hole-Zeeman energy and the passive stabilization is ineffective. The laser is near-resonance with one of the trion transitions, and the radiative contribution Γ*R increases rapidly. At modest Rabi energies of about [formula] ([formula]) for x(y) polarization respectively, the stabilization works and the charge noise is suppressed, reducing the extrinsic linewidth from 42.5 neV to 0.1 (2) neV, respectively. As the Rabi energy is increased, the optimum detuning increases to partially compensate for an increase in Γ*R. For large [formula], the power fluctuations start to dominate, and the extrinsic linewidth increases. We note that the scheme works better for y-polarization, since the AC-Stark effect acts to increase the hole Zeeman energy. A high degree of suppression requires a relatively strong change in the AC-Stark shift with electric-field compared to the hole Zeeman energy. This favors high electron g-factors, and small [formula].

To conclude, the use of a laser induced AC-Stark effect to partially cancel the electric-field dependence of the hole-Zeeman energy and suppress extrinsic dephasing of a quantum dot hole spin due to charge noise is proposed. Calculations that consider additional dephasing induced by the laser, find that for optimized laser detuning and power for a typical quantum dot the extrinsic dephasing can be suppressed by a factor of > 10. The potential use of the AC-Stark effect to stabilize an optical transition has also been considered. In the case of the hole spin, the optical transition energies are more sensitive to electric-field than the hole-Zeeman energy, and a relatively low power can provide sufficient AC-Stark shift to compensate the hole Zeeman energy. However, in the case of stabilizing an optical transition a much higher Rabi energy, comparable to the laser detuning is needed, resulting in strong optical pumping, and a high Γ*R.
