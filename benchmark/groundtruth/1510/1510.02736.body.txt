Informational completeness in bounded-rank quantum-state tomography

Introduction

Quantum-state tomography (QST) is a standard tool used to characterize, validate, and verify the performance of quantum information processors. Unfortunately, QST is a demanding experimental task, partly because the number of free parameters of an arbitrary quantum state scale quadratically with the dimension of the system. In most applications, however, the goal is not to manipulate arbitrary states, but to create and coherently evolve pure states. When the device is performing well and there are only small errors, the quantum states produced will be close to low-rank states, with a few dominant eigenvalues. One can verify the system's performance, with e.g. randomized benchmarking [\cite=emerson05] [\cite=knill08] [\cite=magesan11], to gain confidence that it is near this regime. This important prior information can be applied to significantly reduce the resources required for QST. In this work we address the problem QST in the case that the measurement data arises from a density matrix with rank less than or equal to a given value (bounded-rank QST). In particular, we study the different aspects of informational completeness that allow for efficient and robust state estimation in this scenario.

Bounded-rank QST has been studied by a number of previous workers [\cite=Flammia05] [\cite=Finkelstein04] [\cite=gross10] [\cite=liu11] [\cite=Heinosaari13] [\cite=Chen13] [\cite=Goyeneche14] [\cite=Carmeli14] [\cite=Kalev15] [\cite=Carmeli15] [\cite=Kech15] and shown to be efficient. One approach is based on the compressed sensing methodology [\cite=gross10] [\cite=liu11], where certain sets of randomly chosen measurements guarantee a robust estimation of low-rank states with high probability. Other schemes [\cite=Flammia05] [\cite=Finkelstein04] [\cite=Heinosaari13] [\cite=Chen13] [\cite=Goyeneche14] [\cite=Carmeli15] [\cite=Kech15], not related to compressed sensing, construct specific measurements (POVMs) that accomplish bounded-rank QST, and some of these protocols have been implemented experimentally [\cite=Goyeneche14] [\cite=Hector15]. In addition, some general properties of such measurements have been derived [\cite=Carmeli14] [\cite=Kalev15] [\cite=Kech15].

In bounded-rank QST (rank ≤  r), two notions of informational completeness become relevant [\cite=Heinosaari13] [\cite=Chen13] [\cite=Kalev15]: "rank-r complete" and "rank-r strictly-complete." Rank-r complete measurements can distinguish a rank ≤  r state from any other rank ≤  r state, while rank-r strictly-complete measurements can distinguish a rank ≤  r state from any other physical state, of any rank. Strictly-complete measurements are only possible due to the positive semidefinite property of the density matrix (simply referred to throughout as "positivity") for bounded-rank QST [\cite=Heinosaari13]. It has been shown [\cite=Kalev15] [\cite=Kech15-2] [\cite=Kalev15-2] that strict-completeness has implications for estimating the state of system in the presence of noise. Whereas the set of rank-r states is nonconvex, with rank-r strictly-complete measurements one can use convex optimization programs to estimate the state of the system. Such programs ensure robust estimation of the quantum state. Therefore, it is practically advantageous to use strictly-complete measurements for bounded-rank state estimation.

Currently, the literature lacks analytic tools to easily identify and design POVMs that are rank-r strictly-complete, since it is difficult in general to treat the positivity constraint. We address this problem here by developing new tools based on the concept of the Schur complement. Our method applies to POVMs whose outcomes algebraically determine a particular subset matrix elements of the density matrix. We refer to such POVMs as "element-probing" POVMs (EP-POVMs). For example, the measurements proposed by Flammia  et al. [\cite=Flammia05] and Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14] for pure state tomography are in fact EP-POVMs. In this context, the problem of QST translates to the problem of density matrix completion, where the goal is to recover the entire density matrix when only a few of its elements are given.

The formalism we develop here entirely captures the underlying structure of EP-POVMs and solves the problem of bounded-rank density matrix completion. As such, it gives methods to test whether a given EP-POVM is a rank-r complete or strictly-complete, and thus it has applicability to high-fidelity bounded-rank QST. It also provides intuition on how to design measurement schemes for this task. Based on this intuition, we construct two examples of rank-r strictly-complete POVMs. In addition, we derive a simple certificate for the prior assumption about the rank of the state. Moreover, our analysis elucidates the role of the positivity constraint in quantum tomography. We will show how to apply the positivity constraint to determine whether an EP-POVM is rank-r strictly complete.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. [\ref=sec:QST] we review basic concepts in QST and describe in more details the notion of EP-POVMs and the problem of density matrix completion. In Sec. [\ref=sec:formalism] we develop general tools for our method. We show how they can be used to decide whether a given EP-POVM accomplishes density matrix completion in general and through examples. We also show how to certify the prior assumption about the rank of the state. In Sec. [\ref=sec:positivity] we discuss the notion of strict-completeness and the role of the positivity constraint in QST as manifested in this framework. In Sec. [\ref=sec:noise] we discuss the effect of statistical noise on the state reconstruction, and how positivity helps make the estimations robust. In Sec. [\ref=sec:examples] we construct, using the tools developed, two examples of strictly-complete POVMs which can reconstruct states of an arbitrary bounded-rank. These POVMs can be applied iteratively to refine the estimate of the state. Finally, we offer conclusions in Sec. [\ref=sec:conclusions].

Quantum-state tomography and density matrix completion

Consider a d-dimensional quantum system described by a Hilbert space Hd, and let [formula] be the set of all quantum states on Hd. A state ρ is a bounded rank-r density matrix if its rank is less than or equal to r, i.e., if ρ∈Sr, where [formula], for a permissible r. The set of all quantum states is S  =  Sd. A quantum measurement on the system is described by a POVM, [formula]. The POVM elements, {Eμ}, represent the possible outcomes (events) of the measurement. The probability of measuring an outcome μ is given by the Born rule pμ  =  Tr(Eμρ). For now, we assume that the system is measured to infinite precision, i.e., that the probabilities, {pμ}, are known exactly. Noisy measurements will be discussed in Sec [\ref=sec:noise].

In general, the task in QST is to solve for the density matrix from the series of linear equations given by the Born rule. When the number of linearly independent POVM elements is equal to or larger than d2 (the number of free parameters in a general density matrix) there is a unique solution for the density matrix. In this work we are interested in QST of bounded-rank quantum states, and particularly low-rank quantum states that are described by fewer parameters. We then expect that there exists POVMs with fewer than d2 elements that are informationally complete when the density matrix has bounded rank.

In this article, we restrict our attention to EP-POVMs, i.e., POVMs which allow us to algebraically reconstruct density matrix elements. We specifically consider the case where we are able to reconstruct less than d2 elements, referred to as the "measured elements." With these POVMs, the task of QST is equivalent to the task of density matrix completion, i.e., uniquely reconstructing the remaining (unmeasured) density matrix elements from the measured elements.

Examples of EP-POVMs were studied by Flammia  et al. [\cite=Flammia05], and more recently, by Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14] in the context of pure-state tomography. We briefly discuss them here, since we use them as canonical examples for the framework we develop in the next section. The POVM introduced by Flammia  et al. [\cite=Flammia05] for reconstruction of pure states (Pure-State-Informationally complete, or PSI-complete POVM) is

[formula]

with a and b chosen such that [formula]. Flammia  et al. [\cite=Flammia05] showed that the measurement probabilities pμ  =  〈ψ|Eμ|ψ〉 and [formula] can be used to reconstruct any d-dimensional pure state [formula], in the following way. Under the assumption, c0 > 0, we find that [formula]. The real and imaginary parts of cn, [formula], are found through the relations [formula] and [formula], respectively. The procedure fails when c0  =  0. The PSI-complete POVM of Eq. [\eqref=psi-complete_pure] is in fact an EP-POVM where the measured elements are the first row and column of the density matrix. The probability p0  =  Tr(E0ρ) can be used to algebraically reconstruct the element ρ0,0  =  〈0|ρ|0〉, and the probabilities pn  =  Tr(Enρ) and [formula] can be used to reconstruct the elements ρn,0  =  〈n|ρ|0〉 and ρ0,n  =  〈0|ρ|n〉, respectively.

The second POVM for pure state tomography was studied by Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14]. In this scheme four specific orthogonal bases are measured,

[formula]

Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14] outlined a procedure to reconstruct the pure state amplitudes but we omit it here for brevity. Similar to the PSI-complete POVM, the procedure fails when certain state-vector amplitudes vanish. More details are given in Sec. [\ref=sec:examples]. This POVM is an EP-POVM as well. Here, the measured elements are the elements on the first diagonals (the diagonals above and below the principal diagonal) of the density matrix. Denoting [formula], and [formula], we obtain, [formula] for [formula], and addition of indices is taken modulo d.

By their design, these two POVMs can distinguish a pure state form any other pure state. They accomplish that by measuring different density matrix elements. However, we lack a unified and simple description of the underlying structure of POVMs that allow for a pure-state, and more generally bounded-rank state, identification. Moreover, due to the positivity constraint it is generally hard to determine if there are other density matrices that are consistent with the POVM probabilities. In the subsequent sections we present a framework, which relates EP-POVMs that accomplish bounded-rank QST and deals with the positivity constraint explicitly.

Rank-r complete POVMs

A formal definition of informational completeness which allows for unique recovery of a bounded-rank quantum states is given as follows [\cite=Heinosaari13] [\cite=Kalev15]. Definition 1. A POVM is said to be rank-r complete if no two distinct states ρ and σ in Sr yield the same measurement probabilities,

[formula]

According to this definition, the probabilities of a rank-r complete POVM uniquely identify a rank-r state from within the set of rank-r states. Thus, if an EP-POVM is rank-r complete, then the measured elements uniquely distinguish the state from any other rank-r state, see Fig. [\ref=fig:illustration](a). For example, the POVMs proposed by Flammia  et al. and by Goyeneche  et al. are used to algebraically reconstruct the amplitudes of pure states, and therefore they are rank-1 complete POVMs.

Density matrix completion and the Schur complement

Our technique to determine whether an EP-POVM accomplishes density matrix completion relies on properties of the Schur complement [\cite=Haynsworth68] [\cite=Zhang11]. Consider a block-partitioned k  ×  k Hermitian matrix M,

[formula]

where A is a r  ×  r Hermitian matrix, and the size of [formula], B and C is determined accordingly. The Schur complement of M with respect to A, assuming A is nonsingular, is defined by

[formula]

We will use the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula, which relates the inertia of M to that of A and of M / A [\cite=Haynsworth68],

[formula]

where the inertia of a matrix is its number of negative, zero, and positive eigenvalues, (n-,n0,n+), respectively. A corollary of the inertia formula is the rank additivity property,

[formula]

With these relations we can determine if any EP-POVM is rank-r complete.

As an instructive example, we use the properties of the Schur complement, in an alternative proof that PSI-complete POVM is rank-1 complete, without referring to the pure-state amplitudes. The PSI-complete POVM is an EP-POVM, where the measured elements are ρ0,0, ρn,0 and ρ0,n for [formula]. Supposing that ρ0,0 > 0 and labeling the unmeasured (d - 1)  ×  (d - 1) block of the density matrix by C, we write

[formula]

Clearly, Eq. [\eqref=block_rho] has the same form as Eq. [\eqref=block_mat], such that M  =  ρ, A  =  ρ0,0, [formula], and [formula]. Assume ρ is a pure state so Rank(ρ) = 1. By applying Eq. [\eqref=Schur_rank] and noting that Rank(A) = 1, we obtain Rank(ρ / A) = 0. This implies that [formula], or equivalently, that [formula]. Therefore, by measuring every element of A, B (and thus of [formula]), the rank additivity property allows us to algebraically reconstruct C uniquely without measuring it directly. Thus, the entire density matrix is determined by measuring its first row and column.

Here, we used the assumption that Rank(ρ)  =  1. Therefore, based on this analysis, the reconstructed state is unique to the set S1, and the POVM is rank-1 complete. There might, however, be other density matrices of rank greater than one that have the same measured blocks A, [formula] and B but are different on the unmeasured block C. Moreover, this algebraic reconstruction of the rank-1 density matrix works as long as [formula]. When ρ0,0 = 0, the Schur complement is not defined, and Eq. [\eqref=Schur_rank] does not apply. This, however, only happens on a set of states of measure zero, i.e. the set of states where ρ0,0  =  0 exactly. We call this the failure set of the POVM and it is the exact same set found by Flammia  et al..

The above technique can be used to determine if any EP-POVM is rank-r complete for a state ρ∈Sr. In general, the structure of the measured elements will not be as convenient as the example considered above. Our approach is to study k  ×  k principle submatrices of ρ such that k  >  r. Since ρ is a rank-r matrix, it has at least one nonsingular r  ×  r principal submatrix [\cite=footnote_rank]. Assume, for now, that a given k  ×  k principal submatrix, M, contains a nonsingular r  ×  r principle submatrix A. From Eq. [\eqref=Schur_rank], since Rank(M)  =  Rank(A)  =  r, Rank(M / A)  =  0, and therefore, [formula]. This equation motivates our choice of M. If the measured elements make up A and B (and therefore [formula]) then we can solve for C and we have fully characterized ρ on the subspace defined by M. We refer to block-matrices in this form as a principal submatrix in the canonical form. In practice, the measured elements only need to be related to canonical form by a unitary transformation. In Sec. [\ref=ssec:examples_bases] we discuss such an example where the transformation is done by interchanging columns and corresponding rows. In general, an EP-POVM may measure multiple subspaces, Mi, and we can reconstruct ρ only when the corresponding Ai, Bi, Ci cover all elements of ρ [\cite=footnote_tr]. We label the set of all principle submatrices that are used to construct ρ by M  =  {Mi}. Since we can reconstruct a unique state within the set of Sr this is then a general description of a rank-r complete EP-POVM. The failure set, in which the measurement fails to reconstruct ρ, corresponds to the set of states that are singular on any of the Ai subspaces.

Certifying prior information

The trace of the reconstructed matrix from a rank-r complete EP-POVM can be used as a certificate for the assumption that Rank(ρ)  ≤  r. As an example, we consider the PSI-complete POVM. From the procedure outlined above, under the assumption that Rank(ρ)  =  1, we reconstruct an estimate of the state, labelled [formula], such that [formula]. For a measured state ρ, of any rank, block partitioned as in Eq. [\eqref=block_rho], ρ  ≥  0 if and only if A > 0 and ρ / A  ≥  0 or equivalently,

[formula]

The equality holds only if [formula]. Therefore, the trace of the reconstructed density matrix is bounded by one,

[formula]

where again equality holds if [formula], i.e., if Rank(ρ) = 1. If, contrary to our prior assumption, Rank(ρ)  >  1, the trace of the reconstructed (positive semidefinite) matrix would be smaller than one. Similar arguments apply for other rank-r complete EP-POVMs where the reconstruction is in several steps. Practically, we may quantify the certificate, for example, by using Hoeffding-type inequalities [\cite=Guionnet00],  Pr(|Tr() - 1|  ≥  δ)  ~  e-  δ2. The probability that |Tr() - 1| is larger than some acceptable error parameter, δ, quantifies the confidence that a reduced trace is due to an expected experimental tolerance.

Rank-r strictly-complete POVMs: The role of positivity

The definition of rank-r complete POVM guarantees the uniqueness of the reconstructed state in the set Sr, but it does not say anything about higher-rank states. There may be other density matrices, with rank greater than r that are consistent with the measurement record (or with the measured elements). Since Sr is a nonconvex set, in practice it may be difficult to differentiate between the unique rank-r density matrix and these higher-rank states. We can, however, consider a "stricter" type of POVMs which excludes these higher-rank states. This motivates the following definition [\cite=Chen13] [\cite=Carmeli14] [\cite=Kalev15]. Definition 2. A POVM is said to be rank-r strictly-complete if no two distinct states ρ∈Sr and σ∈S yield the same measurement probabilities,

[formula]

Clearly, if a POVM is rank-r strictly-complete, it is also rank-r complete. If the state has rank less than or equal to r, than a rank-r strictly-complete POVM uniquely identifies it from within the set all quantum states, see Fig. [\ref=fig:illustration](b). This makes rank-r strictly-complete POVMs ideal for use with convex optimization, more details are given in Sec. [\ref=sec:noise]. If an EP-POVM is rank-r strictly-complete, then the measured elements uniquely determine the entire rank-r state from within the set of all quantum states. There are no higher-rank density matrices that have the same measured elements.

The notion of strict-completeness is only nontrivial due to the positivity constraint of quantum states. To see this, let us ignore the positivity constraint and only constrain the density matrix to be Hermitian. Suppose we measure the state with a POVM that has less than d2 linearly independent elements. Since the elements do not span the d2-dimensional vector space of Hermitian operators there are necessarily infinitely many Hermitian matrices consistent with the noiseless measurement record. Therefore, the only rank-r strictly-complete POVMs are ones with at least d2 linearly independent elements. But such a POVM can uniquely determine any Hermitian matrix. On the other hand, if we impose positivity, as we will shortly see, there exists POVMs that are rank-r strictly-complete and require fewer than d2 elements.

As an example, we show that under the positivity requirement the PSI-complete POVM is in fact a rank-1 strictly-complete POVM. We already know that the PSI-complete POVM is rank-1 complete and thus ρ / A = 0. By applying the inertia additivity formula to ρ we obtain

[formula]

This implies that A is a positive semidefinite matrix. For the PSI-complete POVM A = ρ0,0, so this equation is a re-derivation of the trivial condition [formula]. Let us assume that the POVM is not rank-1 strictly-complete. If so, there must exist a quantum state, [formula], with Rank(σ) > 1, that has the same measurement record and thus measured elements as ρ, but different unmeasured elements. We define this difference by [formula], and write

[formula]

Since σ and ρ have the same measurement record, for all μ, Tr(Eμσ) = Tr(Eμρ). Summing over μ and using [formula], we obtain that Tr(σ) = Tr(ρ). This implies that V must be a traceless Hermitian matrix, hence, n-(V)  ≥  1. Using the inertia additivity formula for σ gives,

[formula]

By definition, the Schur complement

[formula]

The inertia additivity formula for σ thus reads,

[formula]

Since A = ρ0,0 > 0, n-(σ)  =  n-(V)  ≥  1 so σ has at least one negative eigenvalue, in contradiction to the assumption that it is a positive semidefinite matrix. Therefore, [formula] and we conclude that the PSI-complete POVM is rank-1 strictly-complete.

A given POVM that is rank-r complete is not necessarily rank-r strictly-complete like the PSI-complete POVM. For example, the four bases measurement, given in Eq. [\eqref=4gmb], correspond to a rank-1 complete POVM, but not to a rank-1 strictly-complete POVM. For these bases, we can apply a similar analysis to show that there exists a quantum state σ with Rank(σ) > 1 that matches the measured elements of ρ.

We now derive the necessary and sufficient condition for a rank-r complete EP-POVMs to be rank-r strictly-complete. Using the notation introduced in Sec. [\ref=ssec:technique], let us choose an arbitrary principal submatrix M∈M that was used to construct ρ. Such a matrix has the form of Eq. [\eqref=block_mat] where [formula]. Let σ be a higher-rank matrix that has the same measured elements as ρ, and let [formula] be the submatrix of σ which spans the same subspace as M. Since σ has the same measured elements as ρ, [formula] must have the form

[formula]

Then, from Eq. [\eqref=Schur_iner], In()  =  In(A)  +  In( / A)  =  In(A)  +  In(V), since  / A  =  M / A  +  V  =  V. If σ is a density matrix then it is a positive semidefinte matrix. A matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if all of its principal submatrices are positive semidefinite [\cite=Zhang11]. Therefore, σ  ≥  0 if and only if   ≥  0, and   ≥  0 if and only if n-(A)  +  n-(V)  =  0. Since [formula], all its principal submatrices are positive semidefinite, and in particular [formula]. Therefore, σ is a state if and only if n-(V)  =  0. We can repeat this logic for all other submatrices M∈M. Hence we conclude that the measurement is rank-r strictly-complete if and only if there exists at least one submatrix M∈M for which every V that we may add (similarly to Eq. [\eqref=Mtilde]) has at least one negative eigenvalue.

A sufficient condition for an EP-POVM to be rank-r strictly-complete is given in the following proposition. Proposition 1. Assume that an EP-POVM is rank-r complete. If it measures the diagonal elements of the density matrix, then it is rank-r strictly-complete. Proof. Consider a Hermitian matrix σ that has the same measurement probabilities as ρ, thus the same measured elements. If we measure all diagonal elements of ρ (and thus, of σ), then for any principal submatrix [formula] of σ, cf. Eq. [\eqref=Mtilde], the corresponding V is traceless because all the diagonal elements of C are measured. Since V is Hermitian and traceless it must have at least one negative eigenvalue, therefore, σ is not positive semidefinite matrix and the POVM is rank-r strictly-complete. [formula] A useful corollary of this proposition is any EP-POVM that is rank-r complete can be made rank-r strictly-complete simply by measuring the diagonal elements of the density matrix.

Tomography in the presence of statistical noise

So far, we have discussed the ideal noiseless measurement case. When the measurement record is noisy, the algebraic reconstruction presented above may not return a density matrix, i.e, a positive semidefinite matrix. In this case, we use numerical algorithms to search for the density matrix which is, e.g., closest to the measurement record. If the POVM we use is rank-r complete, there are potentially other higher-rank density matrices which produce similar data, but are very different than the (bounded-rank) state of the system. Therefore, we must search for an estimate only within the set of rank-r states. However, the set of rank-r states is a nonconvex set and, therefore, it is difficult to find global optimum. Hence, in practice it is difficult to reliably estimate bounded-rank quantum states by measuring rank-r complete POVMs.

On the contrary, rank-r strictly-complete POVMs uniquely identify, in the absence of noise, a rank-r state from within the set of all density matrices. Since the set of density matrices is a convex set we can use convex programs to estimate the state. Convex programs are appealing since they are efficient and converge to global optimum. Moreover, it was recently shown [\cite=Kalev15] [\cite=Kech15-2] [\cite=Kalev15-2] that the estimate returned by a convex program is robust to noise. The positivity constraint allows us to form rank-r strictly-complete POVMs, which in turn, enables us to treat the problem of bounded-rank QST as a convex problem and thereby estimate the state in a robust way.

Another implication of statistical noise is on the failure set of a given POVM. As described above, this set correspond to states for which a principal submatrix Ai used in the reconstruction is singular. Without noise, this is a set of measure zero and is avoided with probability one. However, in the presence of statistical noise this is no longer true. Consider the PSI-complete POVM in the absence of noise, its failure set corresponds to all states for which ρ00 = 0. If the statistical noise has fluctuations of the order of ε then every state within a finite ball [formula] cannot be distinguished from a state with ρ00 = 0, and thus could not be identified by this POVM [\cite=Finkelstein04]. While the PSI-complete POVM has a failure set with a simple structure, other POVMs may have failure sets that are more complex. The more complicated the structure, the less likely it is to affect the estimation of the state in the presence of noise. We consider such an example in Sec. [\ref=ssec:examples_bases]. We thus do not regard the failure set as a practical limitation.

Construction of rank-r strictly-complete POVMs

The framework we developed in the previous sections allows us to construct rank-r strictly-complete POVMs. We present two such POVMs, and describe the algebraic reconstruction of the rank-r state. The POVMs are generalization of the POVMs by Flammia  et al. [\cite=Flammia05] and Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14] from pure states to rank-r states. The construction of these POVMs is made easier thanks to the tools presented in this work. These measurements can also be applied in an iterative scheme to refine our estimate of a the quantum state.

Example 1

A rank-r density matrix has (2d - r)r - 1 free parameters. The first rank-r strictly-complete POVM we form has (2d - r)r + 1 elements, and is a generalization of PSI-complete POVM of Eq. [\eqref=psi-complete_pure]. The POVM elements are,

[formula]

with ak and bk chosen such that [formula]. The probability pk  =  Tr(Ekρ) can be used to calculate the density matrix element ρk,k  =  〈k|ρ|k〉, and the probabilities pk,n  =  Tr(Ek,nρ) and [formula] can be used to calculate the density matrix elements ρn,k  =  〈n|ρ|k〉 and ρk,n  =  〈k|ρ|n〉. Thus, this is an EP-POVM which reconstruct the first r rows and first r columns of the density matrix.

Given the measured elements, we can write the density matrix in block form corresponding to measured and unmeasured elements,

[formula]

where A is a r  ×  r submatrix and A, [formula], and B are composed of measured elements. Suppose that A is nonsingular. Given that Rank(ρ) = r, using the rank additivity property of Schur complement and that Rank(A) = r, we obtain [formula]. Therefore, we conclude that [formula]. Thus we can reconstruct the entire rank-r density matrix.

Following the arguments for the PSI-complete POVM, it is straight forward to show that this POVM is in fact rank-r strictly-complete. The failure set of this POVM corresponds to states for which A is singular. The set is dense on a set of states of measure zero.

The POVM of Eq. [\eqref=psic_mixed] can alternatively be implemented as a series of r - 1 POVMs, where the kth POVM, [formula], has 2(d - k) elements,

[formula]

Suppose that the state of the system is close to a pure state. By measuring the k = 0 POVM, which is the PSI-complete POVM, we obtain most of the information about the state. If we continue and measure the k = 1 POVM, we will obtain the "first-order" correction for the estimate. In the same way, we can measure higher k POVMs and obtain "higher-order" estimates of the state. The rank certificate, discussed in Sec. [\ref=ssec:certificate], can be used to determine when we obtained a reliable estimation.

Example 2

The second rank-r strictly-complete POVM we assemble corresponds to a measurement of 4r + 1 orthonormal bases. It is a generalization of the measurement proposed by Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14]. We first asses the case of r = 1, which is similar to the measurement proposed by Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14]. In this case there are five bases, the first is the computational basis, {|k〉}, [formula] and the other four are given in Eq. [\eqref=4gmb]. Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14] showed that the last four bases are rank-1 complete. Here we give an alternative proof that will be useful for considering the higher-rank generalization.

We label the upper-right diagonals 0 to d - 1, where the 0th diagonal is the principal diagonal and the (d - 1)st diagonal is the upper right element. Each diagonal, except the 0th, has a corresponding Hermitian conjugate diagonal (its corresponding lower-left diagonal). Thus, if we measure the elements on a diagonal, we also measure the elements of its Hermitian conjugate. The computational basis corresponds to measuring the 0th diagonal. In Sec. [\ref=sec:QST] we showed measuring the last four bases corresponds to measuring the elements on the first diagonals. To show that the measurement of these five bases is rank-1 complete, we follow a similar strategy outlined in Sec. [\ref=sec:formalism]. First, choose the leading 3  ×  3 principal submatrix,

[formula]

where, hereafter, the elements in blue are the unmeasured elements. By applying a unitary transformation, which switches the first two rows and columns, we can move M0 into the canonical form,

[formula]

From Eq. [\eqref=Schur_rank] we can solve for the bottom 2  ×  2 block of [formula] if ρ1,1  ≠  0. The set of states with ρ1,1  =  0 corresponds to the failure set. Note that the diagonal elements of the bottom 2  ×  2 block, ρ0,0 and ρ2,2, are also measured. This information can be compared with the reconstruction given by the Schur complement. If the measured diagonal elements are different than the reconstructed diagonal elements, then it is another certificate that the purity assumption is false. We repeat this procedure for the set of principal 3  ×  3 submatrices, Mi∈M, [formula],

[formula]

For each Mi, the upper-right and the lower-left corners elements ρi,i + 2 and ρi + 2,i are unmeasured. Using the same procedure as above we reconstruct these elements for all values of i and thereby reconstruct the 2nd diagonals. We repeat the entire procedure again choosing a similar set of 4  ×  4 principal submatrices and reconstruct the 3rd diagonals and so on for the rest of the diagonals until all the unknown elements of the density matrix are reconstructed. Since, we have reconstructed all diagonal elements of the density matrix and used the assumption that Rank  =  1 these five bases correspond to rank-1 complete POVM. The first basis measures the 0th diagonal so by Proposition 1 the measurement is rank-1 strictly-complete.

The failure set corresponding to M is when ρi,i  =  0 for [formula]. Additionally, the five bases provide another set of submatrices M' to reconstruct ρ. This set of submatrices results from also measuring the elements ρd - 1,0 and ρ0,d - 1, which were not used in the construction of M. The failure set for M' is the same as the failure set of M but since M'  ≠  M we gain additional robustness. When we consider both sets of submatrices the total failure set is ρi,i  =  0 and ρj,j  =  0 for [formula] and i  ≠  j  ±  1. This is the exact same set found by Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14].

We generalize these ideas to measure a rank-r state by designing 4r + 1 orthonormal bases that correspond to a rank-r strictly-complete POVM. The algorithm for constructing these bases, for dimensions that are powers of two, is given in Algorithm [\ref=alg:rankr_GMB]. Technically, we only need to consider the case r < d / 2 [\cite=Heinosaari13]. The corresponding measured elements are the first r diagonals of the density matrix.

Given the first r diagonals of the density matrix, we can reconstruct a state ρ∈Sr with a similar procedure as the one outlined for the five bases. First, choose the leading (r + 2)  ×  (r + 2) principle submatrix, M0. The unmeasured elements in this submatrix are ρ0,r + 1 and ρr + 1,0. By applying a unitary transformation we can bring M0 into canonical form, and by using the rank condition from Eq. [\eqref=Schur_rank] we can solve for the unmeasured elements. We can repeat the procedure with the set of (r + 2)  ×  (r + 2) principle submatrices Mi∈M for for [formula] and

[formula]

From Mi we can reconstruct the elements ρi,i + r + 1, which form the (r + 1)st diagonal. We then repeat this procedure choosing the set of (r + 3)  ×  (r + 3) principle submatrices to reconstruct the (r + 2)nd diagonal and so on until all diagonals have been reconstructed. This shows the measurements are rank-r complete and by Proposition 1, since we also measure the computational bases, the POVM is also rank-r strictly-complete.

The failure set corresponds to the set of states with singular r  ×  r principal submatrix

[formula]

for [formula]. This procedure also has robustness to this set since, as in the case of r  =  1, there is an additional construction M'. The total failure set is then when Ai is singular for [formula] and Aj is singular for j  ≠  i  ±  1.

If we are given a state that is close to pure, similarly to the POVM of Example 1, we can iteratively create estimates of the state. The first five bases form a rank-1 strictly-complete measurement which gives most of the information about the state. Measuring the next four bases forms a rank-2 strictly-complete which gives a first-order estimate of the state. We can repeat, measuring more series of four bases, to get higher-order estimates of the state. Again, using the rank certificate, presented in Sec. [\ref=ssec:certificate], can be used to determine when we obtained a reliable estimation.

Summary and Conclusions

We have studied the problem of QST under the assumption that the state has rank ≤  r, for a permissible r. With this prior information, we can design special measurements that are more efficient than measurements for a general quantum state, that is, POVMs with less than d2 elements. There are two notions of completeness for these measurements: rank-r complete and rank-r strictly-complete. Rank-r complete measurements uniquely identify states within the set of rank ≤  r states while rank-r strictly-complete measurements uniquely identify states within the set of all physical states, of any rank. The latter type of measurements are only possible due to the positivity property of the density matrix. Strict-completeness has a practical implication for estimating the state of system in the presence of noise. Although the set of rank-r states is nonconvex, using rank-r strictly-complete POVMs we are able to use convex optimization programs to estimate the state of the system. Such programs ensure robust estimation of the quantum state.

Generally, it is difficult to asses if an arbitrary POVM satisfies one of these completeness relations. In this work we studied POVMs that allow for the reconstruction of a few density matrix elements, EP-POVMs. In this situation the problem of QST is reduced to density matrix completion. We developed tools to determine if a given EP-POVM is rank-r complete or rank-r strictly-complete based on properties of the Schur complement. These tools provide a unified framework for all EP-POVMs. We applied them to previous constructions of POVMs by Flammia  et al. [\cite=Flammia05] and by Goyeneche  et al. [\cite=Goyeneche14], and showed that they are rank-1 strictly-complete POVM. The framework also allow us to construct new rank-r strictly-complete EP-POVMs and we constructed two examples. These two POVMs can be used iteratively to obtain better estimations for the state of the system, for example, if the state is close to a pure state. Finally, we showed this formalism provides a certificate for the prior assumption about the state of the system.

This work provides a full understanding of element-probing measurements but these are only a subset of all possible measurements. There are non EP-POVMs that are rank-r complete and rank-r strictly-complete but our framework cannot be applied to them. This general case will be studied in subsequent work as well as the relation of this approach to compressed sensing techniques [\cite=Kalev15-2]. We also focused here exclusively on QST but our formalism may be applied to quantum-process tomography and quantum-detector tomography. These other types of tomography are more difficult to asses due to the additional constraints in the problem.
