Introduction

For two sets K and L in [formula], let N(K,L) denote the translative covering number of K by L, that is, the minimum number of translates of L that cover K.

Let K be a convex body (that is, a compact, convex set with non-empty interior) in [formula]. Following Hadwiger [\cite=Ha60], we say that a point [formula] illuminates a boundary point [formula], if the ray {p + λ(b - p)  :  λ > 0} emanating from p and passing through b intersects the interior of K. Boltyanski [\cite=Bo60] gave the following slightly different definition. A direction [formula] is said to illuminate K at a boundary point [formula] if the ray {b + λu  :  λ > 0} intersects the interior of K. It is easy to see that the minimum number of directions that illuminate each boundary point of K is equal to the minimum number of points that illuminate each boundary point of K. This number is called the illumination number i(K) of K.

We call a set of the form λK + v a smaller positive homothet of K if 0 < λ < 1 and [formula]. Gohberg and Markus asked how large the minimum number of smaller positive homothets of K covering K can be. It is not hard to see that this number is equal to [formula]. It is also easy to see that [formula].

Any smooth convex body (ie., a convex body with a unique support hyperplane at each boundary point) in [formula] is illuminated by n + 1 directions. Indeed, for a smooth body, the set of directions illuminating a given boundary point is an open hemisphere of [formula], and one can find n + 1 points (eg., take the vertices of a regular simplex) in [formula] with the property that every open hemisphere contains at least one of the points. Thus, these n + 1 points in [formula] (ie., directions) illuminate any smooth convex body in [formula] (cf. [\cite=BoMaSo97] for details).

On the other hand, the illumination number of the cube is 2n, since no two vertices of the cube share an illumination direction. Even though we do not discuss it, it would be difficult to omit mentioning the Gohberg-Markus-Levi-Boltyanski-Hadwiger Conjecture (or, Illumination Conjecture), according to which for any convex body K in [formula], we have i(K) = 2n, where equality is attained only when K is an affine image of the cube.

For more background on the problem of illumination, see . In Chapter VI. of [\cite=BoMaSo97], one can find a proof of the equivalence of the four definitions of i(K) given above.

The Euclidean ball is a smooth convex body, and hence, is of illumination number n + 1. Theorem [\ref=thm:spiky] shows that, arbitrarily close to the Euclidean ball, there is a convex body of much larger illumination number.

We denote the closed Euclidean unit ball in [formula] centered at the origin o by [formula], and its boundary, the sphere by [formula].

Let 1 < D < 1.116 be given. Then for any sufficiently large dimension n, there is an o-symmetric convex body K in [formula], with illumination number

[formula]

for which

[formula]

We will use a probabilistic construction to find K. We are not aware of any lower bound for the Illumination Problem that was obtained by a probabilistic argument.

For a point [formula], and 0 < φ  <  π / 2, let [formula] denote the spherical cap centered at u of angular radius φ. We denote the normalized Lebesgue measure (that is, the Haar probability measure on [formula]) of C(u,φ) by Ωn - 1(φ).

In Theorem [\ref=thm:almostballupper], we give an upper bound for the illumination number for bodies close to the Euclidean ball. It follows from [\cite=BK09] but, for the sake of completeness, we will sketch a proof.

Let K be a convex body in [formula] such that [formula] for some D > 1. Then the illumination number of K is at most

[formula]

where α  =   arcsin (1 / D).

By combining Theorem [\ref=thm:almostballupper] with the estimate [\eqref=eq:BWkicsi] on Ωn - 1, one can see that [\eqref=eq:iBiggerD] is asymptotically sharp, that is, the base D cannot be improved.

Next, we consider an application of Theorem [\ref=thm:spiky]. Let K be an origin-symmetric convex body in [formula], and denote its gauge function by [formula] (that is, [formula], for any [formula]). We use vert  P to denote the set of vertices of the polytope P. The illumination parameter, introduced by K. Bezdek [\cite=Be06], is defined as

[formula]

The vertex index of K, introduced by K. Bezdek and Litvak [\cite=BL07], is

[formula]

Clearly, ill(K)  ≥  vein(K) for any centrally symmetric body K, and they are equal for smooth bodies. It is shown in [\cite=BL07] that [formula] is of order n3 / 2 (see also [\cite=GL12]).

By [\eqref=eq:BKBcontainment], for the body K constructed in Theorem [\ref=thm:spiky] we have that vein(K) is of order n3 / 2, while ill(K)  ≥  i(K) is exponentially large.

Thus, as an application of Theorem [\ref=thm:spiky], we obtain that ill(K) and vein(K) are very far from each other for some K.

Preliminaries

We will rely heavily on the following estimates of Ωn by Böröczky and Wintsche [\cite=BW03].

Let 0 < φ  <  π / 2.

[formula]

The following is known as Jordan's inequality:

Construction of a Spiky Ball

We work in [formula] instead of [formula] to obtain slightly simpler formulas. We describe a probabilistic construction of [formula] which is close to the Euclidean ball and has a large illumination number. We use the standard notation
