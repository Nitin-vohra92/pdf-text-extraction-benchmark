Counterexamples to Modica's gradient estimate for systems arising in multi-phase transitions

Consider the semilinear elliptic system

[formula]

with W sufficiently smooth and nonnegative.

If m = 1, it was shown by Modica in [\cite=modica] (see also [\cite=cafa]) that every entire (i.e. defined in the whole space), bounded solution satisfies the pointwise gradient estimate

[formula]

If m  ≥  2, the analog of the above property does not hold in general. Indeed, if it was satisfied by some entire solution (not necessarily bounded), then the following monotonicity formula would hold:

[formula]

(see for instance [\cite=alikakosBasicFacts]). However, in the case of the Ginzburg-Landau system arising in superconductivity, where

[formula]

there are bounded, entire solutions to ([\ref=eqEq]) which violate the aforementioned monotonicity formula (see [\cite=brezisMerle] [\cite=pisante]). These solutions satisfy

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some ci > 0, i  ≥  2. In this regard, let us point out that a weak version of the monotonicity formula ([\ref=eqMonotStrong]), where the exponent n - 1 is replaced by n - 2, holds for any solution of ([\ref=eqEq]) with any W  ≥  0 smooth (for n  ≥  2, see for example [\cite=alikakosBasicFacts] [\cite=smets]). In fact, as was explained in [\cite=smets], the exponent n - 2 is the natural one for the Ginzburg-Landau system. Actually, in the case of the Ginzburg-Landau system with n = 1 and m = 2, the gradient estimate ([\ref=eqGB]) is violated by the periodic solutions

[formula]

provided that

[formula]

Indeed, an easy calculation (see also [\cite=smyrnelis]) shows that

[formula]

In passing, we note that this family of periodic solutions seems to have been first observed in [\cite=brezisMerle].

From now on, we will consider system ([\ref=eqEq]) with W  ≥  0 having a finite number of global minima, which typically are assumed to be nondegenerate, appears mainly in the study of multi-phase transitions (see [\cite=alikakosBasicFacts] and the references therein). But also in other contexts such as the study of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (see [\cite=alamaARMA15] and the references therein). In that case, as explained in [\cite=alikakosBasicFacts], the number n - 1 is the natural exponent in the denominator in ([\ref=eqMonotStrong]). In fact, several properties related to ([\ref=eqMonotStrong]) (with exponent n - 1) have recently been shown to hold in [\cite=AlikakosDensity] for this class of systems in the case of energy minimal solutions (in the sense of Morse). In this regard, it is of interest to know whether the analog of Modica's gradient estimate ([\ref=eqGB]) holds for bounded, entire solutions to this class of systems (see the related comments in [\cite=alikakosBasicFacts] and Open Problem 1 in [\cite=fazly]). It is worth noting that a class of such systems which satisfy this property has been provided in [\cite=GhosubPass]. On the other hand, a counterexample to this property, for such systems, was provided very recently by [\cite=smyrnelis]. The main idea was to start with a very particular (but smooth) periodic function [formula] and then build around it an axially symmetric [formula], with just two global minima, such that u solves ([\ref=eqEq]) and passes through the global minimizers of W with nonzero velocity. The gradient estimate ([\ref=eqGB]) is clearly violated there (as well as the corresponding Liouville type theorem in [\cite=cafa] [\cite=modica]). In our opinion, the whole construction was rather artificial. Roughly speaking, the curve representation of the aforementioned periodic solution on the plane consisted of two parallel line segments which were joined together smoothly with two semicircles.

Our purpose in this short note is to provide considerably simpler counterexamples by considering the axially symmetric [formula] with four global minima (one on each half-axis), considered in [\cite=alamaARMA15], in the parameter regime where W is close to the Ginzburg-Landau potential ([\ref=eqGL]). As the reader may have already guessed, the counterexamples will be one-dimensional periodic solutions which are smooth perturbations of the family ([\ref=eqper]) with θ as in ([\ref=eqtheta]) but sufficiently close to zero. It would be interesting to investigate whether one can construct higher dimensional counterexamples based on the solutions that were mentioned below ([\ref=eqGL]).

For ε > 0, let

[formula]

Obviously, this axially symmetric potential has the four points (  ±  1,0), (0,  ±  1) as its only global minimizers. They are nondegenerate but degenerate as ε  →  0. To the best of our knowledge, the investigation of this limiting behavior goes back at least as far as the physics paper [\cite=barankov]. Our aforementioned counterexamples to Modica's gradient estimate can be provided at once by combining the next proposition, which is of independent interest, with ([\ref=eqIneq]).

We observe that system ([\ref=eqEq]) with potential as in ([\ref=eqWeps]) is symmetric according to the definition of [\cite=fazly]. Moreover, it is orientable for positive solutions according to the definition in [\cite=fg].
