A Perfect Bounce

Introduction. -- Recent observations have revealed extraordinary simplicity in the large scale structure of the universe: a spatially flat geometry with nearly scale-invariant, Gaussian fluctuations. As yet, there are no indications of tensor (gravitational wave) modes which would signal primordial inflation, nor isocurvature modes. The simplicity of these findings seems at odds with expectations based on inflationary models, predicting a "multiverse" with random and unpredictable behavior on large scales. We are therefore encouraged to seek more economical explanations for the observed state of the cosmos. One of the oldest and simplest ideas [\cite=Friedmann] is that the big bang was a bounce. Such a bounce is generally forbidden in classical general relativity, but might be allowed in quantum gravity [\cite=LoopBounce].

Near the big bang singularity, the density and temperature of matter diverges. General arguments indicate that the only complete quantum field theories are those possessing a UV fixed point, i.e., theories which are conformally invariant at high energies [\cite=Shomer]. Therefore it is of particular interest to study cosmologies with conformally invariant matter, where the trace of the stress tensor vanishes. In four spacetime dimensions, the line element for a flat, radiation-dominated FRW universe is simply [formula], where η is the conformal time. This metric describes a "perfect bounce": it is perfectly regular for all η  ≠  0. It possesses a unique analytic continuation in η, obtained by passing around the singularity in the complex η  -  plane. As we shall see, perturbations about this metric share these nice properties. In a pioneering 1967 paper by B.S. DeWitt [\cite=dewitt], developing canonical quantum gravity, this idea was anticipated. DeWitt noted that the Hamiltonian operator involves a second derivative with respect to the timelike coordinate on superspace, and that the only natural norm, being "Klein-Gordon-like," would only remain positive if the wave function was restricted to positive frequency modes. He observed that such a restriction is incompatible with a boundary condition limiting superspace to real, invertible metrics, adding: "One might hope that an analytic continuation could be performed around (the point of vanishing metric determinant) but whether this would have any physical meaning is unclear." In this paper, we perform such a continuation and give its physical interpretation.

We shall study the quantum dynamics of a universe with conformal matter consisting of perfect radiation and conformally coupled scalar fields. We first study the quantum evolution of an FRW background, showing that the semiclassical (saddle-point) approximation to the path integral is actually exact. We then generalize to homogeneous, anisotropic metrics, showing that the anisotropy is in a certain precise sense "invisible" as the universe passes across the bounce.

Next, we shall show how generic perturbations may be included, order by order in a perturbative expansion. Although perturbation theory fails as we approach η = 0 along the real axis, we can maintain the validity of the perturbative expansion by deforming the time contour into the lower-half complex η  -  plane as we circumvent the singularity. This continuation respects all the symmetries of general relativity, and yields a completely unambiguous result. For perfectly conformal matter, we calculate the quantum mechanical creation of scalar density perturbations and gravitational waves across the bounce and find no obstruction. For exactly conformal theories there is a well-defined, stable vacuum. For realistic theories with nontrivial running and/or soft breaking terms one can expect finite particle production across the bounce.

Weyl-invariant formulation. -- We consider a universe containing a perfect radiation fluid and M conformally coupled scalar fields [formula]. As in Ref. [\cite=BST], we "lift" Einstein gravity to a classically Weyl-invariant action,

[formula]

The fluid has energy density ρ, particle number density n, and four-velocity Uμ. The Lagrange multiplier φ enforces particle number conservation. We assume that the entropy per particle is a constant; if not, it may also be included as an additional variable [\cite=Brown].

The action ([\ref=eq1]) is invariant under local Weyl transformations. While φ has the "wrong sign" kinetic term, there is no physical ghost since φ can be Weyl-gauged to a constant. Likewise, one can choose Einstein gauge, in which the coefficient of R is a constant, obtaining Einstein gravity coupled to scalar fields. However, for describing cosmological solutions, other gauges may be more convenient. We could add further terms, e.g., quartics in the scalars, while preserving Weyl-invariance. Such terms are subdominant near the singularity and, for simplicity, we shall ignore them.

Quantum Mechanics of an FRW Bounce. -- For cosmological (FRW) solutions, one can choose a conformal gauge in which the metric is static and the scalars encode all of the dynamics. While the metric is nonsingular in this gauge, the theory is still problematic because the effective Planck mass, given by the coefficient of R, can vanish, so that gravity becomes strongly coupled; for example, metric perturbations including gravitational waves diverge near the singularity. We avoid this divergence by analytically continuing in the space of fields. Our key assumption, which we shall test in various calculations, is that there are no singularities preventing such a continuation. For definiteness, we fix D = 4.

Fixing the metric to ds2 =  - N2(t)dt2 + hijdxidxj, where hij is a metric of constant three-curvature R(3) = 6κ, Eq. ([\ref=eq1]) reduces to

[formula]

where [formula] is the comoving spatial volume. Here r denotes the value of the radiation density ρ in our gauge, and [formula]. Now, setting [formula], with [formula] and [formula], the action reduces to that for a relativistic oscillator with frequency [formula] and mass m = 2V0r,

[formula]

Feynman Propagator from Path Integral. -- Following Ref. [\cite=hennteit], the Feynman propagator corresponding to the action in Eq. ([\ref=eq3]) is given by a phase space path integral, Eq. ([\ref=phsppathint]) is obtained from a canonical analysis of Eq. ([\ref=eq2]) using Dirac's algorithm, after 'solving' two second class constraints to eliminate φ and its momentum [\cite=longpaper].

We gauge-fix the invariance under time reparametrizations generated by the Hamiltonian constraint by adding [formula] to the action [\cite=halliwdw]. This reduces the integration over N̄ to a regular integral over proper time τ. The remaining path integrals are Gaussian and computed exactly via stationary phase, i.e., using the appropriate classical solutions [formula] with x20 =  - 1 / κ. Integration over m and pm yields

[formula]

The type of propagator one obtains depends on the range of integration for τ [\cite=halliort]. For the Feynman propagator, τ runs from 0 to ∞  , and we insert a convergence factor -  ετ / (2m) in the exponent.

The path integral in Eq. ([\ref=eq3a]) corresponds to M + 1 decoupled harmonic oscillators,

For κ = 0, the τ integral can be performed exactly, giving the real-space massive particle propagator [\cite=longpaper] [\cite=birdav],

[formula]

where H(2)α(s) is a Hankel function with argument [formula] and -  iε indicates the expression is the boundary value of a function which is analytic in the lower half - (x - x')2  -  plane.

These expressions demonstrate explicitly that when quantum gravity with conformal matter is restricted to FRW backgrounds, the Feynman propagator is perfectly regular at the cosmological "singularity." Notice also that the "mass" m depends on the volume V0, and enters multiplicatively in the action. In the limit of large V0, the background is "heavy," and will suffer little quantum spreading or backreaction from perturbations. (This feature has been observed before, e.g., in Ref. [\cite=rovelliwe].)

Does this good behavior persist for more generic metrics? We shall investigate this question first by relaxing the assumption of isotropy and then by tackling more general, inhomogeneous spacetimes. In both cases, we will need to analytically continue "around" the FRW singularity in the superspace coordinates xα. The previous results are completely independent of either the complex t-contour used to define the action or the integration cycle in complexified phase space (xα,Pα) over which the path integral is taken, provided it converges. For FRW cosmologies, all the path integrals are Gaussian and the stationary phase integral is unique.

Anisotropies. -- We choose a conformal gauge in which the metric is [formula] (temporarily restoring the dimension D for clarity), with [formula]. Setting xα  =  a(t)vα, with v2 =  - 1 so that a(t) is the Einstein-frame scale factor, the action ([\ref=eq3]) becomes

[formula]

It describes a massive particle moving on a curved "superspace" which for fixed a is [formula]. In the absence of anisotropy, superspace is just Minkowski spacetime in Milne coordinates. The anisotropies, however, curve superspace. The quantum Hamiltonian is fixed by covariance to be [formula] [\cite=DeWitt], where [formula] is the Laplacian on superspace and ξ is an arbitrary parameter.

With anisotropies, the path integral is hard to perform exactly. However, we can solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation [formula] directly for the wavefunction Ψ. First, we eliminate v and λi in favor of the corresponding conserved momenta ζ and kA on [formula]. Next, we eliminate first derivatives by defining Ψ = a- (M + D - 2) / 2χ. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation then reduces to a one-dimensional Schrödinger-type equation with an inverse square potential,

[formula]

The constant C receives contributions from the Laplacian on [formula], the change from Ψ to χ, and the curvature on superspace: [formula]. In D = 4 and for ξ taken as the conformal coupling on superspace, as has been advocated [\cite=halliwdw], C is generally positive for small ζ and kA, but becomes arbitrarily negative as they increase. Therefore we shall consider the solutions of Eq. ([\ref=aniso2]) for general C although, as we shall see, our results will be extremely insensitive to its precise value.

Eq. ([\ref=aniso2]) is invariant under scaling symmetry a  →  λa, m  →  λ- 1m of the starting action ([\ref=eq1]), which introducing anisotropy does not break. This leads to some remarkable consequences. First consider the repulsive case, C > 0. Classically, the quantity a2 evolves as a particle in a linear potential: the general (positive) solution is [formula] for large |t|. a "bounces" with no time delay: the slow-down created by the potential is canceled by a turning around at a positive value so that the inverse square potential is "invisible" in classical scattering. The scale symmetry forbids any dependence of the time delay on C. For C negative, we shall see that the same conclusion follows.

The potential is also "invisible" in scattering in the quantum theory. We define positive- and negative-frequency modes by

[formula]

where H(1)α(z) and H(2)α(z) are Hankel functions. Their continuation to negative arguments is given (see, e.g., Ref. [\cite=TT]) by H(2)α(e-  iπz) =  - eiπνH(1)α(z), H(1)α(eiπz) =  - e-  iπνH(2)α(z). From this, and the usual asymptotic behavior of Hankel functions, we infer that an incoming positive frequency mode matches perfectly to an outgoing positive frequency mode, without any phase shift.

This surprising behavior is not hard to understand: instead of evolving a positive frequency mode from negative a to positive a along the real axis (where the potential becomes singular), we evolve it along a semicircle at large |a| in the lower half a - plane. Along such a contour, the semiclassical (WKB) expansion remains valid and there is no mixing between positive and negative frequency modes. The contribution of the potential to the overall WKB phase is easily seen to be negligible.

This definition of modes renders the potential invisible, for all C. For C > 0, it ensures that the quantum and classical theories correspond, as Eq. ([\ref=aniso2]) has two real solutions for a > 0: one vanishes at small a while the other diverges. Rejecting the latter and restricting to a > 0 would be problematic for many reasons. First, the wavefunction would be necessarily real and could not describe a state with momentum, i.e. an expanding or contracting cosmology. Second, the natural conserved (DeWitt) norm [formula] would be zero, making it hard to define any meaningful unitary evolution. Third, the correspondence principle would be violated. The phase shift with C > 0 and such a boundary condition turns out to be [formula], independent of m; states of arbitrarily large m would not behave classically. Finally, for [formula], both solutions to Eq. ([\ref=aniso2]) tend to zero with a, as power laws. There is no reason to exclude either. Any prescription which excludes half the C > 0 modes is necessarily discontinuous in the space of momenta ζ and kA, which seems unreasonable. None of these problems occur with the modes defined in Eq. ([\ref=aniso3]). A positive frequency mode describes a bouncing universe, with unit DeWitt norm. The correspondence principle is respected. The treatment of modes is uniform across all momenta.

For [formula], the eigenfunctions of interest undergo an infinite number of oscillations as a tends to zero. The WKB approximation actually improves as one heads toward the singularity, suggesting a simple classical explanation of the "invisibility" behavior in this regime. If we allow the classical solution a small imaginary part in t0, a runs in from -    ∞  , approaching the origin, but then runs down the imaginary a - axis before returning to the origin and running out to +    ∞  . The speedup due to the negative potential on the real a - axis is precisely canceled by the delay due to the excursion down the imaginary axis; there is no net time delay. This excursion down the imaginary axis is nothing but the "antigravity" regime discussed in Ref. [\cite=BST]. (There is no analog for [formula] because the WKB approximation fails at small real a in that case.) This suggests that the "antigravity" regime is a consequence of trying to make the quantum behavior look classical, and that it should not be taken literally as a new classical phase.

Perturbations. -- We now consider the semiclassical propagation of perturbations across a cosmological singularity. For simplicity, we take M = 0 and study planar perturbations around a flat (κ = 0) background, solving the Einstein equations in a perturbation expansion.

Starting from Eq. ([\ref=eq1]) in Einstein gauge, we take the background metric to be ds2 = a2(η)( - dη2  +  δijdxidxj). As [formula], we can equivalently think of analytic continuation in the scale factor a (as in the previous section) or in the conformal time coordinate η.

With the assumed symmetry, the perturbed metric is

[formula]

where φ, ψ, γ and hT are functions of η and x only. For simplicity, we set the second tensor mode appearing as a metric perturbation gyz to zero (its dynamics are analogous to those of hT).

We adopt a coordinate system in which the radiation is at rest everywhere ( comoving gauge), and write the radiation density as ρ(η,x) = ρ0(η)(1 + ε  δr(η,x)). We expand the perturbations and Einstein's equations in powers of ε: [formula], etc.

At order εn, Einstein's equation for the tensors hT(n) is

[formula]

where Jn is nonlinear in the lower-order perturbations. There are four Einstein equations analogous to Eq. ([\ref=einstein]) for the scalar perturbations δr, φ, ψ and γ. In Ref. [\cite=longpaper], we derive the tensor and scalar Green's functions and solve Einstein's equations order by order in ε.

Consider the nonlinear extension of positive frequency solutions of the linearized equations, of wavenumber k0:

[formula]

with φ(1), γ(1) and δ(1)r determined in terms of ψ(1).

In Ref. [\cite=longpaper], we give the second-order perturbations, which involve Gamma functions and logarithms. After suitable definition of branch cuts, they are analytic in the lower half η  -  plane, allowing us to avoid the classical singularity η = 0, see Fig. [\ref=contourfig], just as for the homogeneous background. Such a contour represents a regular bounce with nonlinear perturbations.

There is no quantum production of scalar or tensor perturbations across this bounce. We can see this by computing the leading terms of the nonlinear perturbations as η  →    ±    ∞  . We find that at large |η|, hT(2) is

[formula]

where [formula] are terms subleading in (k0η), and

[formula]

There is no mixing of positive and negative frequencies, and hence no particle production. The full functions hT(2) and ψ(2) decay exponentially for negative imaginary time. This property, which extends to all orders in the perturbation expansion, unambiguously defines nonlinear positive frequency modes [\cite=longpaper].

On the real axis, ψ(2) does not decay at large |η|, indicating a breakdown of perturbation theory. Metric perturbations are gauge-dependent; we compute the 'gauge-invariant' Newtonian potential Φ [\cite=bardeen], finding Φ(2)  ~  O(1 / k0η) at large |η| at second order in ε. Comparing with the first-order potential Φ(1)  ~  O(1 / k20η2) still indicates a breakdown of the expansion when [formula]. This phenomenon has a simple physical explanation. The radiation fluid is governed by nonlinear dynamics; nonlinearities kick in after some time, leading to shocks. A careful analysis [\cite=fluidpaper] shows that perturbation theory breaks down when [formula]. Perturbation theory can thus be trusted for [formula] (Fig. [\ref=contourfig]), where we obtain a perturbation expansion in ε for nonsingular, nonlinear solutions in the complex η  -  plane.

Conclusions. -- Our results suggest that a valid semiclassical approximation to quantum gravity coupled to conformal matter can be obtained by following complex classical solutions along a contour in the complex η  -  plane that bypasses the classical big bang singularity at η = 0, and represents a "perfect bounce". We have studied this first for homogeneous, isotropic FRW backgrounds, computing the Feynman propagator, and then for anisotropic universes, where we found the asymptotic behavior of wavefunctions to be completely insensitive to the effective potential generated by anisotropies at small scale factor a. When adding inhomogeneities, unique positive frequency solutions are obtained; perturbation theory breaks down at large times due to the nonlinear evolution of the radiation fluid, but this is physically well understood [\cite=fluidpaper]. All these examples suggest that there exists a consistent and robust description of the semiclassical propagation of long wavelength modes across a quantum bounce.
