Let π be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representation of [formula] with Fourier coefficients λπ(n). Asymptotic expansions of certain sums of λπ(n) are proved using known functorial liftings from GL2, including symmetric powers, isobaric sums, exterior square from GL4 and base change. These asymptotic expansions are manifestation of the underlying functoriality and reflect value distribution of λπ(n) on integers, squares, cubes and fourth powers.

Introduction

Let [formula] be a unitary automorphic irreducible cuspidal representation of [formula] with Fourier coefficients λπ(n). For each finite p for which πp is unramified we can associate to πp Satake parameters [formula] such that

[formula]

For ramified πp, one can still choose [formula], by allowing some of them to be zero, such that the finite-part automorphic L-function attached to π is

[formula]

for Re s > 1.

If π is associated with a holomorphic cusp form for a congruence subgroup of [formula], the Ramanujan bound was proved by Deligne [\cite=Del]

[formula]

for p with πp being unramified. For other cases the best known bound toward the Ramanujan conjecture is

[formula]

which is due to Kim and Sarnak [\cite=KimSar].

Let us review known functoriality from an automorphic cuspidal representation π of [formula] (cf. Kim [\cite=Kim2]).

1.1. The symmetric square lift. By Gelbart and Jacquet [\cite=GlbJcq] Sym2π is an automorphic representation of [formula]. It is cuspidal if and only if π is not monomial. Here π is monomial which means that there is a nontrivial grössencharacter ω so that [formula]. This in turn means that π corresponds to a dihedral Galois representation Gal[formula].

1.2. The symmetric cube. Kim and Shahidi [\cite=KimShh1] proved that Sym3π is an automorphic representation of [formula]. In addition, Sym3π is cuspidal if and only if π does not correspond to a dihedral or tetrahedral Galois representation. We recall π is tetrahedral means there exists a grössencharacter [formula] so that [formula]. Here [formula], where ωπ is the central character of π.

1.3. The symmetric fourth power. By Kim [\cite=Kim1] Sym4π is an automorphic representation of [formula]. It is either cuspidal or unitarily induced from cuspidal representations of [formula] and [formula]. More precisely, Sym4π is cuspidal unless π corresponds to either a dihedral, tetrahedral, or octahedral Galois representation (Kim and Shahidi [\cite=KimShh2]). Here π is octahedral means Ad3π is cuspidal, but there exists a nontrivial quadratic character μ so that [formula].

1.4. The tensor product of GL2  ×  GL3. Let π2 and π3 be unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula] and [formula], respectively. Then, by Kim and Shahidi [\cite=KimShh1], [formula] is an automorphic representation of [formula]. It is isobaric and is cuspidal or irreducibly induced from unitary cuspidal representations. When π2 is not dihedral, [formula] is cuspidal unless π3 is a twist of Ad(π2) by a grössencharacter (Ramakrishnan and Wang [\cite=RmkWng]).

1.5. The Rankin-Selberg convolution of GL2  ×  GL2. Let π1 and π2 be unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula]. By Ramakrishnan [\cite=Rmk] their isobaric representation [formula] is an automorphic representation of [formula]. In case of π1 and π2 being not associated to characters of a quadratic extension, [formula] is cuspidal if and only if π1 and π2 are not twisted equivalent by any grössencharacter.

1.6. Exterior square of GL4. Let π4 be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula]. By Kim [\cite=Kim1] and Henniart [\cite=Hnn] the exterior square lift [formula] is an automorphic representation of [formula]. Moreover [formula] is of the form [formula] where each σi is a cuspidal representation of [formula], ni > 1. Its cuspidality was classified by Asgari and Raghuram [\cite=AsgRgh].

1.7. Base change. Let π be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representation of GL2 over [formula]. Suppose that there is a Galois number field F of prime degree [formula] over [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] is a class character of [formula] attached to F. In other words, [formula] is trivial exactly on [formula]. Note that [formula] is a character of order [formula]. By Langlands [\cite=Lng] and Arthur and Clozel [\cite=ArtClz], [\eqref=notpieta] implies that

[formula]

lift to an automorphic cuspidal representation Π of GL2 over F. This base change Π is stable under the action of [formula] and given by

[formula]

The subject goal of this paper is to establish an asymptotic expansion of a certain sum of Fourier coefficient λπ(n) of the GL2 cuspidal representation π based on its functorial lifting in each of the cases 1.1-1.7. These sums and asymptotic expansions can be regarded as a manifestation of the underlying functoriality. They also provide deep insight into the value distribution of λπ(n) on positive integers, squares, cubes and fourth powers.

Asymptotics of this kind are important consequences in Rankin [\cite=Rnk] and Selberg [\cite=Slb] as they developed their theory. Similar asymptotics were later obtained by Lao and Sankaranarayanan [\cite=LaoSnk1] [\cite=LaoSnk2], Lau, Lü and Wu [\cite=LauLvWu], and Lau and Lü [\cite=LauLv].

Theorem 1.1. Let π be a unitary automorphic irreducible cuspidal representation of [formula]. Assume that π is not monomial so that Sym2π is cuspidal. Then the L-function

[formula]

converges absolutely for Re s > 1 and has an analytic continuation to Re [formula] with a simple pole at s = 1. Moreover,

[formula]

where [formula].

Theorem 1.2. Let π be a unitary automorphic irreducible cuspidal representation of [formula]. Assume that π does not correspond to a dihedral or tetrahedral Galois representation so that Sym3π is cuspidal. Then the L-function

[formula]

converges absolutely for Re s > 1, and has an analytic continuation to Re [formula] with a simple pole at s = 1. Moreover,

[formula]

where [formula].

Theorem 1.3. Let π be a unitary automorphic irreducible cuspidal representation of [formula]. Assume that π does not correspond to a dihedral, tetrahedral, or octahedral Galois representation so that Sym4π is cuspidal. Then the L-function

[formula]

converges absolutely for Re s > 1 and has an analytic continuation to Re [formula] with a simple pole at s = 1. Moreover,

[formula]

where [formula].

Theorem 1.4. Let π1 and π2 be two unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is cuspidal. Then the L-function

[formula]

converges absolutely for Re s > 1 and has an analytic continuation to Re [formula] with a simple pole at s = 1. Moreover,

[formula]

where [formula].

Theorem 1.5. Let π1 and π2 be two unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula] not associated to characters from a quadratic field. Suppose that π1 and π2 are not twisted equivalent by any grössencharacter so that [formula] is cuspidal. Then the L-function

[formula]

converges absolutely for Re s > 1 and has an analytic continuation to Re [formula] with a simple pole at s = 1. Moreover,

[formula]

where [formula].

Theorem 1.6. Let π1 and π2 be two unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula]. Suppose that π1 and π2 are not twisted equivalent by any grössencharacter and that [formula] is cuspidal. Then

[formula]

for some constants c1 and c0.

Theorem 1.7. Let π be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representation of [formula], and χ a nontrivial Dirichlet character modulo prime [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula] is a polynomial of degree [formula].

We remark that Theorems 1.1-1.3 are a generalization of Theorem 1.1 in Lao and Sankaranarayanan [\cite=LaoSnk1] [\cite=LaoSnk2] where the same asymptotics (with the same error terms) were proved assuming π corresponds to a self-dual holomorphic cusp form of even integral weight on the full modular group [formula]. The proof of Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=LaoSnk2], however, should not have used a subconvexity bound for L(s,Sym2f) proved by Li [\cite=XLi]. Using a subconvexity bound for ζ(s) which was recently improved by Bourgain [\cite=Brg] we can correct the proof and obtain a better result.

Theorem 1.8. Let f be a self-dual holomorphic cusp form for a congruence subgroup of [formula]. Then

[formula]

In the next section we will outline the main techniques which we will use.

Some properties of L-functions

We need a classical lemma by Landau [\cite=Lnd] (cf. Ram Murty [\cite=Mrt]).

Lemma 2.1. Let an  ≥  0 and set

[formula]

Suppose f(s) is convergent in some half-plane and that it has analytic continuation, except for a pole at s = 1 of order k, to the entire complex plane and it satisfies a functional equation

[formula]

where c is a certain positive constant and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula], and Pk - 1(y) is a polynomial in y of degree k - 1.

Now we summarize some basic properties of automorphic L-functions. Let π be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representation of [formula], with Fourier coefficients λπ(n) normalized by λπ(1) = 1. For simplification, we write απ(p) = αp and βπ(p) = βp. By [\eqref=Lpi], we have

[formula]

Let S be a finite set of primes containing all p at which πp is ramified. Then the [formula]-symmetric power L-function attached to π

[formula]

has an Euler product outside S

[formula]

for Re s > 1.

Similarly the Rankin-Selberg L-function of Symmπ times its contragredient

[formula]

has an Euler product outside S

[formula]

for Re s > 1. For p∉S its parameters are

[formula]

Consequently

[formula]

Then we have for p∉S

[formula]

for [formula].

We note that for m = 2,3,4, the Rankin-Selberg L-function [formula] has an analytic continuation to [formula] with a simple pole at s = 1, when Symmπ is cuspidal. Using the convexity bound for [formula] Li and Young [\cite=XLiYng] proved the following lemma.

Lemma 2.2. Let π be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representation of [formula] such that Sym4π is cuspidal. Then

[formula]

converges for σ > 1.

Proof of Theorems 1.1-1.3.

Define a Dirichlet series

[formula]

for Re s sufficiently large. Since Lm(s) is not known to be automorphic, we want to factor a Rankin-Selberg L-function out of Lm(s).

Lemma 3.1 Let π be a unitary automorphic cuspidal representation of [formula] such that Symmπ is cuspidal. Then we have for m = 2,3,4,

[formula]

where Um(s) as an Euler product is absolutely convergent and hence nonzero for Re [formula] for m = 2, Re [formula] for m = 3, Re [formula] for m = 4.

Proof. First we factor Lm(s) as in [\eqref=Lm]:

[formula]

by denoting the last product in [\eqref=LmUm] by Um(s). Here

[formula]

for j  ≥  1.

By [\eqref=lambdapk], we have

[formula]

for [formula]. Comparing [\eqref=lambdaRSsymm] and [\eqref=lambdapi2] we get for p∉S

[formula]

Now let us turn to the series in the denominator in [\eqref=LmUm] for p∉S. By [\eqref=RSsymmExp], we get

[formula]

Thus for p∉S

[formula]

First let us consider the case of m = 2. Then for p∉S [\eqref=Umterm] becomes

[formula]

which converges when [formula]. Thus U2(s) in [\eqref=LmUm] is dominated by

[formula]

By Cauchy's inequality, [\eqref=dominateU2] is dominated in turn by

[formula]

which converges when 4σ - 1 - ε > 1, i.e., when [formula] by Lemma 2.2. Hence U2(s) is absolutely convergent and hence is nonzero for [formula].

Then let us turn to the case of m = 3. Then for p∉S [\eqref=Umterm] becomes

[formula]

which converges when [formula]. Thus U3(s) in [\eqref=LmUm] is dominated by

[formula]

which converges absolutely for [formula] by Lemma 2.2. Therefore, U3(s) converges absolutely for [formula]

Now let m = 4. Then for p∉S [\eqref=Umterm] is

[formula]

which converges for [formula]. Thus U4(s) in [\eqref=LmUm] is dominated by

[formula]

which in turn is dominated by

[formula]

by [\eqref=7over64]. By Lemma 2.2 [\eqref=dominateU4] converges absolutely for [formula] i.e., for [formula]. Consequently, U4(s) converges absolutely for Re [formula]. [formula]

The L-function [formula] satisfies the conditions of Landau's Lemma 2.1 with k = 1 and 2A = (m + 1)2. Thus we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Expand

[formula]

which converges absolutely for Re [formula] for m = 2, Re [formula] for m = 3, and Re [formula] for m = 4 by Lemma 3.1. By [\eqref=LmUm]

[formula]

For m = 2, [\eqref=conv] becomes

[formula]

by [\eqref=Landaum]. Using

[formula]

we get

[formula]

By [\eqref=2n2] and [\eqref=u2] we conclude

[formula]

where [formula] or by a Tauberian argument.

The cases of m = 3,4 are similar. [formula]

Proof of Theorems 1.4-1.7.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let π1 and π2 be unitary automorphic cuspidal representations of [formula]. Suppose that π1 and π2 are not twisted equivalent by a grössencharacter so that [formula] is cuspidal. Denote by αp and βp the Langlands parameters of π1 at p, and by γp and δp the Langlands parameters of π2. Suppose without loss of generality that [formula] and [formula]. Let T be a finite set of primes containing all p at which either π1p or π2p is ramified. Then at p∉T Sym2π2 has parameters γ2p, 1 and δ2p, while [formula] has αpγ2p, αp, αpδ2p, βpγ2p, βp and βpδ2p. Thus for p∉T

[formula]

and both [formula] and |λπ1(pj)|2|λπ2(p2j)|2 for [formula] are equal to

[formula]

Define

[formula]

for [formula]. Then by [\eqref=12p] and [\eqref=both] we have at p∉T that

[formula]

for [formula]. Consequently by [\eqref=12pj], the L-function

[formula]

for Re s sufficiently large, can be factored as

[formula]

by denoting the last product in [\eqref=L12factor] by V1,2(s). Note that by [\eqref=Qj] the sum of Qj in [\eqref=L12factor] is actually taken over [formula] for p∉T.

For p∉T by [\eqref=Qj] the series

[formula]

is dominated by

[formula]

which in turn is dominated by

[formula]

by [\eqref=7over64]. Thus [\eqref=dominate] converges absolutely when [formula], and its sum is then

[formula]

Therefore when [formula], V1,2(s) is dominated by

[formula]

By Lemma 2.2 and Cauchy's inequality, [\eqref=dominateprod] converges absolutely for [formula] Thus V1,2(s) converges absolutely for Re [formula].

Applying Landau's Lemma 2.1 to [formula], we have

[formula]

By the Dirichlet convolution on the right hand side of [\eqref=L12factor] we have

[formula]

which leads to [\eqref=Thm14]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.5 is similar to that of Theorem 1.4 with the same notation. We have for p∉T

[formula]

for [formula]. Consequently by [\eqref=11p] and [\eqref=11Rj], the L-function

[formula]

with V1,1(s) convergent absolutely for Re [formula].

Applying Landau's Lemma 2.1 to [formula], we have

[formula]

By the Dirichlet convolution on the right hand side of [\eqref=L11factor] we have [\eqref=Thm15]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.6. With π1 and π2 as above so that [formula] is cuspidal, its exterior square representation [formula] has Langlands parameters α2p, β2p, γ2p, δ2p and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since π1 and π2 are not twisted equivalent by any grössencharacter, [\eqref=exteriorL] has a double pole at s = 1 and is otherwise analytic. The L-function we are interested in is

[formula]

for Re s sufficiently large. Here

[formula]

By Lemma 3.1, the four L-functions in the product of [formula] in [\eqref=4L] can be factored as

[formula]

for i,j = 1,2, where Ui,j(s) as an Euler product converges absolutely for Re [formula]. Multiplying [\eqref=Lij] according to [\eqref=4L] we can express [formula] as the product of [\eqref=exteriorL] and [formula]. Then using Landau's Lemma 2.1 with k = 2 and 2A = 36 and Dirichlet convolution we prove [\eqref=Thm16].[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.7. From [\eqref=notpieta] we can show that π and [formula] are not twisted equivalent by any | det |it, [formula]. In fact, if

[formula]

for some [formula], then

[formula]

which is impossible. Moreover,

[formula]

for any [formula] when [formula].

By [\eqref=LPi] we have the Rankin-Selberg L-function

[formula]

By [\eqref=nottwist] we can see on the right hand side of [\eqref=RSPi], each diagonal L-function (j = k) has a simple pole at s = 1 and each off-diagonal L-function (j  ≠  k) is entire. Consequently, [formula] has a pole of order [formula] at s = 1 and is analytic elsewhere. It also has a standard functional equation. Its complete L-function is bounded in vertical strips and is holomorphic except for poles at s = 0,1 ([\cite=JcqSha1], [\cite=JcqSha2], [\cite=MglWld]).

The L-function in [\eqref=RSPi] can be simplified to

[formula]

Note this L-function has nonnegative coefficients

[formula]

It converges absolutely for Re s > 1. Its rank is [formula] and hence the sum of coefficients of s in Γ functions in its Archimedean factor is [formula]. By Landau's Lemma 2.1,

[formula]

where [formula] is a polynomial of degree [formula].

By [\eqref=simplified], we may express the Fourier coefficients [formula] in terms of λπ(n). By Goldfeld and Hundley [\cite=GldHnd], [formula] is an idelic lift of a nontrivial Dirichlet character [formula]. Therefore by [\eqref=simplified]

[formula]

Then [\eqref=Thm17] follows from [\eqref=asymBC] and [\eqref=lambdaBC]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem 1.8

Let f be a self-dual holomorphic cusp form for a congruence subgroup of [formula]. To improve the error term bound in [\eqref=n2asym], we factor [\eqref=LmUm] further for m = 2:

[formula]

using the local parameters

[formula]

of the self-dual L(s,Sym2f  ×  Sym2f). As in the proof of Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=LaoSnk2], we use Perron's formula and shift the contour from [formula] to [formula] to get

[formula]

Since U2(s) converges absolutely for Re s > 1 / 2,

[formula]

By a dyadic subdivision we have

[formula]

By [\eqref=L2zetaU2] and Cauchy's inequality we have

[formula]

Now we need Lemma 2.6 in [\cite=LaoSnk2]

[formula]

and a subconvexity bound for ζ(s) by Bourgain [\cite=Brg]

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=symbound] and [\eqref=zetabound] to [\eqref=I1ll] we have

[formula]

For the integrals I2 and I3 over the horizontal segments, we use [\eqref=zetabound] and the convexity bounds for L(s,Sym2f) and L(s,Sym4f) to get

[formula]

By [\eqref=I1I2I3], [\eqref=I1bound] and [\eqref=I2I3bound] we get

[formula]

Taking [formula] in [\eqref=xTbound], we finally get [\eqref=n2asymholo].[formula]
