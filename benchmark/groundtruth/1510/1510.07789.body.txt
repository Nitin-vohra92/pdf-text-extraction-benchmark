Estimation of the r-th derivative of a density function by the tilted kernel estimator

Tilted Kernel estimators for derivative

Settings and assumptions

Suppose we have an i.i.d sample of random variables [formula]. [\cite=Hall_Doosti] introduced the tilted Kernel estimator n(x) as

[formula]

where [formula], K is bounded, symmetric and compactly supported. Note that the conventional Kernel estimator is a special case of when pi,n  =  1 / n for all [formula].

Observe that [formula] forms a probability measure on n points for [formula], let us agree to call the family [formula] the family of probability measures associated to n.

Suppose we know the the density function f is r times differentiable, it would be intuitive to just take the s-th derivative of n to be the estimator of f(s), for s  ≤  r, namely,

[formula]

Selection of the associated probability measures

In [\cite=Hall_Doosti], the authors selected the associated probability measures to be, for [formula],

[formula]

with hn the bandwidth and g defined as follow,

[formula]

The functions [formula] are obtained recursively as in [\cite=Hall_Doosti]. Consequently, we can express the expectation of n as,

[formula]

Convergence speed

Suppose we are estimation the s-th derivative of a density. It is shown in [\cite=Hall_Patil_1995] that the convergence rate, in probability, of n- (r - s) / (2s + 1) can be achieved by the wavelet estimator.

We show that, in Theorem [\ref=speed], the same convergence speed can be achieved by the tilted kernel estimator with an appropriate associated probability measures. That is, we show that

[formula]

with the appropriate choice of the bandwidth h.

Technical results

Let [formula], the non-standardised version of pi,n as in ([\ref=associated_measures]) and

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the result can be shown by showing

[formula]

for some h  =  hn > 0 and probability measures [formula].

To show ([\ref=1]), first let [formula] and observe that by choosing the associated measure as in ([\ref=associated_measures]), we have

[formula]

Since g is, by definition and assumption, bounded on the real line, Δn  ≤  1 / 2 almost surely for sufficiently large n. Therefore the first term on the right hand side of ([\ref=residual]) can be bounded, almost surly, by 4Δ2n and hence

[formula]

where the last equality follows from the Law of Large Numbers applied to the triangular array [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Again, since g, K(r) are bounded, the expectation of the second term of ([\ref=residual]) can be bounded as follow,

[formula]

Thus we have shown ([\ref=1]).

To show ([\ref=2]), let [formula], note that

[formula]

Hence it suffices to show that the result hold for ψ. To see this, we observe that as

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

for some ξ∈[x,x  +  hu]. Thus, by choosing [formula] we have

[formula]

hence proving ([\ref=2]).
