A Diophantine sum with factorials

Context of the problem

The problem x3 + y3 + z3  =  x + y + z is listed in the book by Guy (see  [\cite=rG1981]) as an unsolved problem of circa 1981. However, later Guy also mentions Bremner,  [\cite=aB1977] remarking that he "has effectively determined all parametric solutions". Bremner's paper is thorough and sophisticated, whereas, Oppenheim  [\cite=aO1966] also considers this same problem and provides small solutions. In volume three of classical Number Theory compendium by Dickson  [\cite=aO1966] the equation [formula] is simply mentioned as having known solutions, but without examples nor any further remarks. The problem itself of solving the Diophantine equation x3 + y3 + z3  =  x + y + z was used in a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by van der Poorten  [\cite=vdP1975] in the case of index 3, and it turns out equivalent to solving a! / (a - 3)!  +  b! / (b - 3)!  =  c! / (c - 3)!.

Diophantine equations typically take the simplistic form, for integers aj, ak, x, y, and fixed positive integers m or s,

[formula]

In this note we consider the form for positive integers n, a - n, b - n, c - n,

[formula]

and show that for n = 3 there are an infinite number of integer solutions, and that, since

[formula]

these reduce to x3 + y3 + z3  =  x + y + z which is in the traditional form ([\ref=E:1.1]). It is easy to find solutions of ([\ref=E:1.2]) such as the following:-

Hence, using ([\ref=E:1.3]) on ([\ref=E:1.4]) to ([\ref=E:1.8]) we find solutions of a3 - a + b3 - b = c3 - c for positive integers a, b and c, for instance,

[formula]

We know from Fermat�s Last Theorem�s that a3 + b3 = c3 is not possible for positive integers a, b and c, so ([\ref=E:1.9]) to ([\ref=E:1.13]) is a kind of surprising variant on this. Let�s check for solutions to ([\ref=E:1.2]) where n = 4. The equation we are dealing with is therefore,

[formula]

or equivalently, for positive integers a, b and c,

[formula]

A shallow search of natural numbers a, b and c, less than 100 yields no non-trivial cases of ([\ref=E:1.15]). However, the equations a3 + a + b3 + b = c3 + c - 63 and a3 + a + b3 + b = c3 + c - 103 have solutions, some examples as follows,

Evidently this factorial form of problem is relatively new in the ancient literature, as in since 2002. There appears to be a nontrivial theory worth exploring for it. For example, we show below that there are an infinite number of solutions to the equation a! / (a - 3)!  +  b! / (b - 3)!  =  c! / (c - 3)! for positive integers a, b and c. This is equivalent to asserting that there are an infinite number of solutions to the equation a(a + 1)(a + 2)  +  b(b + 1)(b + 2)  =  c(c + 1)(c + 2). There was a brief unresolved online discussion on equations of kind ([\ref=E:1.2]) where n = 3 in 2002. The discussion thread unsuccessfully sought an identity for these and/or a proof that an infinite number of solutions exist. We next provide that proof and identity.

Proof of infinite number of solutions

We start with the

The equation a3 - a + b3 - b = c3 - c has an infinite number of positive integer solutions.

PROOF. Let a = u - v,b = kv,c = u + v. After substitution this becomes (k3  -  2)v2  -  6u2  =  k  -  2, which is a Pell type equation if we fix a value of k.

For k  =  1; we arrive at v2  +  6u2  =  1, whose only integer solutions are u = 0, v = 1, or v =  - 1. For k = 2, we have next v2  =  u2  +  1, whose only integer solutions are also u = 0, v = 1, or v =  - 1.

For k  =  3 we have 25v2 - 6u2 = 1, which is a Pell equation with an infinite number of solutions. END OF PROOF.

Incidentally, for 25v2 - 6u2 = 1, the general solution is given by

[formula],

[formula],

for non-negative integers n. So we have an infinite family of solutions starting with:

v = 1,u = 2,a = 1,b = 3,c = 3 (trivial solution), then

v = 97,u = 198,a = 101,b = 291,c = 295 ...

For k = 4: 31v2 - 3u2  =  1

This Pell-type equation has solutions: v = 14,u = 45,a = 31,b = 56,c = 59

v = 340214,u = 1093635,a = 753421,b = 1360856,c = 1433849 ...

For k = 5,6 there are no solutions.

For k = 7 we arrive at 341v2 - 6u2  =  5.

This has an infinite number of solutions, starting with:

v = 13,u = 98,a = 85,b = 91,c = 111

v = 941,u = 7094,a = 6153,b = 6587,c = 8035 ...

Any one of the above solvable Pell equations proves the theorem.

Solutions of equation a! / (a - n)!  +  b! / (b - n)!  =  c! / (c - n)! for n = 6

We state the

The equation

has positive integer solutions.

After a fairly extensive search it seems likely that the only solutions of ([\ref=E:3.1]) are:

There seems no literature related to ([\ref=E:3.1]), which could be restated in terms of binomial coefficients as

.

Hence, equations ([\ref=E:3.2]), ([\ref=E:3.3]) and ([\ref=E:3.4]) above could be written as solutions to ([\ref=E:3.5]) as:
