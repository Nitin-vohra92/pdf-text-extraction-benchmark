Bell-type Inequalities for Arbitrary Non-Cyclic Networks

Introduction.-- The milstone work of John Bell showed that quantum correlations arising between spatially separated observers can break the limitations of classical physics [\cite=Bell64]. Studies of correlations predicted by quantum theory has been a key to understanding fundamental properties of the theory and has led to applications in information processing including random number generation [\cite=PA10], device-independent cryptography [\cite=DI] and reduction of communication complexity [\cite=BC10].

A Bell experiment considers a source emitting a physical system shared between a set of observers who can randomly chose to apply some local measurements. The standard bipartite Bell experiment is illustrated in Figure [\ref=fig1] a). The properties of the correlations arising between the outcomes of the observers in Bell experiments have been thoroughly studied [\cite=Bell14] and may be considered fairly well understood. However, much less is known about the nature of correlations arising in more sophisticated network configurations beyond the Bell experiments. A network could in general involve many independent sources each emitting a physical system that is shared between some set of observers. Importantly, a single observer could be recieving subsystems of many independent physical systems originating from different sources. It is interesting to study the properties of correlations arising in quantum theory versus those of classical physics in such networks, partly due to networks being a natural generalization of Bell experiments, and partly because quantum correlations in network are important for the practical implementation of large scale quantum communication networks e.g. in cryptography and communication complexity.

Bell's theorem can be viewed as a statement of causal inference: by observing correlations we can infer a conclusion on the nature of the cause generating the correlations. The approach of causal inference has been extensively used to analyze correlations in networks [\cite=F12(1)] [\cite=F12(2)] [\cite=WS12] [\cite=HLP14] [\cite=CK15] [\cite=LS15]. Furthermore, Bell-type inequalities have been derived for various classes of networks. The first such analysis considered a chain-network of three observers involving two bipartite physical sources [\cite=BGP10] [\cite=BRGP12], see Figure [\ref=fig1] b). This was generalized by studies of Bell-type inequalities for networks in a star-shape configuration [\cite=TSCA14], an example of which is given in Figure [\ref=fig1] c). The Bell-type inequalities for star-networks have been extended to networks with sources emitting multipartite physical systems [\cite=T15], see e.g. Figure [\ref=fig1] d). Methods for deriving network Bell-type inequalities have been more broadly analyzed in Ref.[\cite=C15]. Furthermore, an iterative approach has been presented for finding Bell-type inequalities on networks [\cite=RB15]: given a Bell-type inequality for some network, one can construct a new Bell-type inequality for the same network to which we have now added a source connecting some observer in the initial network to one new observer. This method allows for finding Bell-type inequalities on cycle-free networks that involve only bipartite physical systems, up to variations of the initial network and the Bell inequality from which the iteration initiates.

In this work, we will show how to construct Bell-type inequalities for any tree-structured network i.e. any network that does not contain cycles. This will be achieved by an iterative procedure in which the network and the associated Bell-type inequality are gradually constructed. Explicitly, we will show that if given a Bell-type inequality for some network [formula], we can construct a new Bell-type inequality for another network [formula] which is obtained by adding to [formula] a new source connecting one observer to L new observers. Importantly, we will give many examples of networks in which quantum theory violates our inequalities. We will both reproduce the strengh of quantum violations on some already studied networks, and demonstrate strong quantum violations on networks for which our method makes a contribution.

Network Bell-type inequalities.-- A network [formula] consists of N sources each associated to a local random variable λj∈Λj with some density function ρj(λj). Let there be M observers [formula] in [formula]. The k'th observer can chose a measurement Xk from a set of choices and the outcome is denoted ak∈{0,1}. In a classical model of the resulting probability distribution [formula], the local outcome of Ak is determined by Xk and the set of local random variables λ̄k to the sources of which Ak is connected by recieving a part of the emitted physical system. Thus, any classical model satisfies

[formula]

Let us now show how to construct Bell-type inequalities on any network that is a tree-structure; that is arbitrary cycle-free networks. Assume that on [formula] we have a Bell inequality

[formula]

where akXk denotes the Xk'th measurement of Ak, cX1...XM are some real coefficients and 〈a1X1...aMXM〉 denotes the global correlator defined as [formula].

We construct a new network [formula] in which we have extended [formula] by connecting to observer AM a source which emits a physical system shared between AM and L new observers B1,...,BL whom each perform one of two measurements. Let AM chose between 2sM measurements, for some sM  ≥  0. We aim to find a Bell-type inequality on [formula]. For simplicity, we divide the possible scenarios into two:

Case 1: sM  ≥  L. We will group AM's measurements into 2L disjoint non-empty sets κX where the index X runs over all subsets [formula]. Then, for some set of positive real numbers [formula] satisfying [formula], there exists a Bell-type inequality for correlations on [formula]:

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

where δkX = 1 if k∈X and otherwise δkX = 0.

To prove this claim, we associate a hidden variable λj∈Λj with density function ρj(λj) to the j'th source in [formula]. The source we add to [formula] is associated to hidden variable μ∈W with density function ρW(μ). Since the L new parties have binary outcomes, they have together 2L possible outcome strings. For every possible outcome string, the associated values of μ are collected in the sets WX  =  {μ∈W|bk0 = ( - 1)δkXbk1,k = 1,...,L}. Clearly {WX}X is a partition of W. The probability associated to μ∈WX is denoted [formula] from which it holds that [formula]. Furthermore, we introduce distributions ρWX  =  ρW / qX normalized on WX.

In a classical model, QX is written:

[formula]

where [formula] if μX∈WX and otherwise âMXM,X,μX = 0. Note that we have relabeled the integration variable μ as μX only for sake of clarity. We can think of the product series over bk0 as a trivial relabeling of the correlator 〈a1X1...aMXM〉 on [formula] by either positive or negative sign.

Define quantities

[formula]

Due to understanding of the above correlators as relabelings of the original correlators on [formula], it follows from [\eqref=Bell] that

[formula]

If we use that [formula] together with equation [\eqref=Q], it directly follows that there exists a set {qX}X such that [\eqref=ineq] is a Bell-type inequality on [formula].

Case 2: sM < L. Since we can no longer partition the set of AM's measurements into 2L non-empty sets, we will increase the number of measurements of AM so that sM = L. Again, indexing the measurements of AM by the subsets of [formula], we can make the trivial partition κX  =  {X} for every [formula]. To find a Bell-type inequality, we again follow the above procedure, with the minor modification that the right-hand side of [\eqref=sumS] is replaced with 2L - sM since we have made use of the inequality [\eqref=Bell] 2L - sM times. Thus we find the inequality:

[formula]

A first remark: above we assumed that all qX are positive real numbers whereas nothing in the above arguement prevents some qX to be zero, yielding singularities in [\eqref=ineq] and [\eqref=ineq']. Therefore, it is necessary to note that in such cases the inequalities [\eqref=ineq] and [\eqref=ineq'] will be modified such that the summation in the left-hand-side only goes over events with qX > 0 which are physically relevent.

A second remark: we note that the same method with minor modification can be used to prove variations of our theorem, e.g. with different number of measurements for AM, and also to include non-full correlation terms. Also, it is worth observing that when [formula] is an extension of [formula] by a bipartite source (L = 1), our inequalities reduce to those derived in Ref.[\cite=RB15], up to the just mentioned minor modifications.

However, the relevans of our Bell-type inequalities ought to be judged from from the possibility of violating them by a theory in which probability distributions do not admit the form [\eqref=classical]. Of particular interest are the physically realizable distributions, obtained from quantum theory. Therefore, we will proceed with several examples of networks for which we explicitly find Bell-type inequalities and demonstrate violations by quantum thery. To gain confidence in the relevance of our inequalities, we will both use our method to reproduce results previously known, and also go beyond the scope of previous work.

Example 1.-- We consider the network [formula] in Figure [\ref=Examples] a). We construct [formula] by starting from the network [formula], involving only A1 and A2, and then connect A2 via a threepartite source to the new observers B1 and B2. This scenario has been explicitly considered in both [\cite=T15] and [\cite=RB15], in the latter of which an iterative method limited to adding bipartite sources was used, but in reverse: start from the network associated to the threepartite source and then connect one new observer via a bipartite source. However, we shall see that we can reproduce the quantum violations of both [\cite=T15] and [\cite=RB15] with our method.

The CHSH inequality [\cite=CHSH69] holds on [formula];

[formula]

We note that the 'connecting' observer A2 has 2s2 with s2 = 1 measurements, while we are adding L = 2 observers. Therefore, using our theorem we find the following inequality for the network [formula]:

[formula]

Let us investigate the possibility of violating the inequality using quantum theory. For this purpose, we introduce the states [formula] and the mixture of |φm〉 with random noise; ρm = v|φm〉〈φm| + (1 - v) / 2m for v∈[0,1], where [formula] is the identity operator. We will denote the total visibility in the network by V which is the product of the v's of all individual sources in [formula]. We quantify the strength of a violation by the critical visibility Vc which is defined as the largest value of V that satisfies the inequality.

For our example in Figure [\ref=Examples] a), we distribute the state ρ2 and ρ3 respectively in the two sources in [formula]. Let observers A1, B1 and B2 perform measurements [formula] and [formula], where σx = |1〉〈0| + |0〉〈1| and σy = i|1〉〈0| - i|0〉〈1|. Let A2 perform measurements [formula] and [formula]. A straightforward calculation will show that each of the four correlators in [\eqref=2p1] takes the value [formula]. Therefore, it is easy to realize that the minimum over [formula] occurs at qX   =   1 / 4 [formula]. Thus, we have found the violation [formula] whenever [formula]. The critical visibility [formula] is the same as obtained in previous studies of correlations on this network [\cite=T15] [\cite=RB15].

Example 2.-- Let us now consider the family of networks, here denoted [formula], studied in [\cite=T15] in which a center node is connected via N sources to L observers respectively, see Figure [\ref=Examples] b). The intial network [formula] is the standard Bell experiment in which observers A1,1,...,A1,L + 1 share a physical system. We can use our theorem N - 1 times, each time adding a source connecting A1,L + 1 to L new observers, until we have constructed [formula].

We begin the iteration from the Bell inequality given in [\cite=T15] for [formula]:

[formula]

Using N - 1 iterations of our theorem to in every step add another L + 1 partite source, we find that for some non-negative values of {qlX}X for l = 1,...,N - 1 such that [formula] [formula], there is a Bell-type inequality:

[formula]

The correlators appearing in this inequality are of the same type as those that appears in the work of Ref.[\cite=T15]. Following the analysis of Ref.[\cite=T15], we distribute the state ρL + 1 in all N sources. The observers Aj,k for j = 1,...,N and k = 1,...,L perform aj,k0 = M+ and aj,k1 = M-. For the center node A1,L + 1; if |X| is even (odd) then perform [formula] ([formula]) where we have defined [formula] and [formula]. The work of [\cite=T15] showed that such measurements result in each of the correlators in [\eqref=ineq2] being [formula]. The minimum over each of the sets {qlX}X for l = 1,...,N - 1 is achieved at qlX = 1 / 2L for all X and l. Thus, we find a violation [formula] whenever [formula]. The critical visibility [formula] is the same as found in Ref.[\cite=T15] for this family of networks.

Example 2

Let us now consider the network [formula] in Figure [\ref=Examples] b) which is beyond the scope of the iterative method of [\cite=RB15] but within the scope of [\cite=T15]. The intial network [formula] is the part of Figure [\ref=Examples] b) involving the observers A1,A2,A3, and [formula] is obtained by connecting A3 to a three partite source introducing two new observers B1,B2. For the network [formula], classical correlations satisfy the Mermin inequality [\cite=M90]:

[formula]

In analogy with example 1, using our theorem we find the Bell-type inequality:

[formula]

where we have for simplicity introduced the notation [formula] and [formula].

A strong quantum violation can be found in analogy with example 1: we distribute the state ρ3 in both sources, let the observers A1,A2,B1,B2 perform the measuremets M±, and let A3 perform [formula] and [formula]. A calculation analogous to that in example 1 will show that all four correlators in [\eqref=2p2] evaluate to V / 2. The minimum over {qX}X is achieved at [formula] and therefore we have a violation [formula] whenever V > 1 / 4. The critical noise Vc = 1 / 4 is the same as found in the analysis in [\cite=T15].

Example 3.-- Let us now give an example going beyond the scope of previous work. Our network [formula] is given in Figure [\ref=Examples] c). As initial network [formula] we use the threepartite Bell experiment involving observers A1,A2,A3. In a first use of our theorem, we connect A3 to B1 via a bipartite source, forming the network [formula]. Then, we connect B1 via a threepartite source to observers C1 and C2, obtaining the network [formula]. Since the network [formula] is the same as the network in Figure [\ref=Examples] c), we can apply our theorem to the inequality [\eqref=2p1] to obtain a Bell-type inequality for [formula]. This can compactly be written as

[formula]

To violate the inequality with quantum theory, we distribute the states ρ3,ρ2,ρ3 in the respective sources. We let observers A1,A2,C1 perform the measurements M±, while C2 performs c20  =  σx and c21 =  - σy. The observer A3 performs [formula] and [formula], and observer B1 performs [formula] and [formula]. Calculating all the 16 correlators appearing in [\eqref=2p2p2], we find that for given X,Y, the associated correlator is [formula]. Thus, all the signs in the left-hand side of [\eqref=2p2p2] cancel, making the minimization problem trivial; qX   =   pY   =   1 / 4 [formula], leading to the violation [formula] whenever [formula]. The critical noise [formula] follows the Mermin-type scaling encountered for quantum correlations obtained from dichotomic measurements [\cite=M90] [\cite=BRGP12] [\cite=TSCA14] [\cite=RB15] [\cite=T15]; that every additional observer amounts to an additional factor of [formula] in Vc.

Example 4.-- As a final example, let us consider the network [formula] in Figure [\ref=Examples] d). For the initial network [formula] involving only the observers A1,A2,A3, the Mermin inequality holds;

[formula]

By adding a threepartite source, connecting A3 to observers B1 and B2, we obtain the network [formula]. Using our theorem, we find the following Bell-type inequality on [formula].

[formula]

where we have for simplicity introduced [formula] and C{1} = C{2} = (a10a20 - a11a21) / 2.

We connect observer B2 to two new observers C1 and C2 via another threepartite source and thus obtain the network [formula]. Again, applying our theorem starting from the inequality [\eqref=middle] we find Bell-type inequality on [formula]:

[formula]

We can violate this inequality using quantum theory. Distribute in each source the state ρ3 and let observers A1,A2,B1,C1 perform measurements a10 = a20 = b10 = c10 = M+ and a11 = a21 = b11 = c11 = M-. Let A3 perform [formula] and [formula], let B2 perform [formula] and [formula], and let C2 perform c20  =  σx and c21 =  - σy. Then it is straightforward to find that the correlator in [\eqref=ineq4] associated to a given pair X,Y is ( - 1)δ2X|Y|V / 4. Thus, we find the violation [formula] whenever V > 1 / 8. The critical visibility Vc = 1 / 8 corresponds to a critical visibility of v = 1 / 2 per source, which falls in line with the expected scaling of Vc.

Discussion.-- We constructed an iterative method for deriving Bell-type inequalities on any network of observers and sources that does not contain cycles. We examplified the capacity of our method for several networks by studying violations obtained from quantum theory, from which we could both successfully reproduce known results and certify strong quantum correlations in previously unstudied networks.

An interesting issue is the matter of critical visibilities for quantum correlations. It is known that in Mermin's multipartite Bell inequalities [\cite=M90], the critical visibility scales with a factor of [formula] for every additional observer. An analog observation of critical visibilities has been made also for quantum correlations on networks [\cite=BGP10] [\cite=BRGP12] [\cite=TSCA14] [\cite=RB15] [\cite=T15]. So far, no example has been found in which our presented method can provide a lower critical visibility than what is expected from such scaling. Nevertheless, there is evidence indicating that this is not a fundamental property and that quantum correlations on networks ought to reveal additional interesting features compared to standard Bell experiments [\cite=CASA11]. For further investigations, it would be of great interest to construct Bell-type inequalities on networks with more than two outcomes for all observers. This has indeed been called for in several previous works.

As a final remark, we mention the open problem of finding Bell-type inequalities on networks featuring cycles. To the best of the author's knowledge, no examples of such inequalities are known.
