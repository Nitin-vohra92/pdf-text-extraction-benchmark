Shortest Distance in Modular Cubic Polynomials

Introduction and Main results

Recently, the author [\cite=C] studied the shortest distance in modular hyperbola [formula] and its relation with the least quadratic nonresidue modulo p. Inspired by this, we study the shortest distance in modular cubic polynomial in this paper. It is worthwhile to remark that, the shortest distance can have magnitude p for linear polynomials while the shortest distance can be as small as O(1) for quadratic polynomials.

Let p  >  3 be a prime, (a,p)  =  1 and any integer c. We consider the modular reduced cubic

[formula]

The restriction to such reduced cubic polynomials is not restrictive at all as one can transform a general cubic to such form through change of variables in x and y which does not affect the shortest distance between two points in Ca,c. Instead of distances, we consider how small a box

[formula]

contains at least two points in Ca,c where X and Y run over 0, 1, ..., p - 1.

To study this, we use a recent result of Heath-Brown [\cite=H] and Shao [\cite=S] on mean-value estimates of character sums:

Given H  ≤  p, a positive integer and any ε  >  0. Suppose that 0  ≤  N1  <  N2  <  ...  <  NJ  <  p are integers satisfying Nj + 1  -  Nj  ≥  H for 1  ≤  j  <  J. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

and χ is any non-principal character modulo p.

Applying the above theorem, we can show that

For any ε  >  0, for any (a,p)  =  1, integer c and H  ≫  εp1 / 6  +  ε, we have

[formula]

for some 0  ≤  X,Y  ≤  p - 1.

Some Notations Throughout the paper, p stands for a prime. The symbol |S| denotes the number of elements in the set S. We also use the Legendre symbol [formula]. The notations f(x)  ≪  g(x), g(x)  ≫  f(x) and f(x)  =  O(g(x)) are equivalent to |f(x)|  ≤  Cg(x) for some constant C  >  0. Finally, f(x)  ≪  λ1,...,λkg(x), g(x)  ≫  λ1,...,λkf(x) and f(x)  =  Oλ1,...,λk(g(x)) mean that the implicit constant C may depend on λ1, ..., λk.

The Basic Argument

Without loss of generality, we assume that p  >  3. For (a,p)  =  1 and any integer c, suppose [formula] for some 0  ≤  X,Y  ≤  p - 1. This means that

[formula]

for some 1  ≤  x,y  ≤  p and 1  ≤  u,v  ≤  H. Subtracting, we get

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the multiplicative inverse of y modulo p (i.e. [formula].) After some algebra and completing the square, we have

[formula]

The above process is reversible. So [formula] for some 0  ≤  X,Y  ≤  p - 1 is equivalent to

[formula]

We are going to restrict our attention to even u  =  2u''s and v  =  2v''s. So we want

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

Suppose ([\ref=cond]) is not true. Then either

[formula]

or

[formula]

for all 1  ≤  u',v'  ≤  H / 2. If the former is true for two pairs of 1  ≤  u',v'  ≤  H / 2, we have

[formula]

which gives Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Henceforth we suppose the latter is true for all but at most one pair of 1  ≤  u',v'  ≤  H / 2. Hence

[formula]

Suppose [formula] for all 0  ≤  X,Y  ≤  p - 1. Then the points au'3  +  cu' are spaced more than H apart. So we can apply Theorem [\ref=Shao] and get

[formula]

which gives H  ≪  ε,rp(r + 1) / (6r)  +  ε / 2. This contradicts H  ≫  εp1 / 6  +  ε if r is sufficiently large. This final contradiction together with ([\ref=aside]) gives Theorem [\ref=thm1].
