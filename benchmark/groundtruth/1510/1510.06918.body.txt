Introduction

Game theory is a useful analysis tool in many realms of scientific researches. In the realm of quantum mechanics, a lot of games (called quantum pseudo-telepathy games or nonlocal quantum games in the literatures, called quantum games for short in the present paper) have been proposed in order to illustrate the strangeness of quantum mechanics to non-physicists. For example, Bell inequalities [\cite=Bell] can be rephrased as Bayesian games [\cite=BL13]. Usage of game theory terms like "input, output, payoff, advice" instead of physics terms like "observable, measurement, eigenvalue, hidden variable, entanglement" makes it easier for non-physicists to understand "nonlocality" [\cite=nonlocality], one of the strangest properties of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, quantum games are good examples of demonstrating the advantage of quantum resources over classical resources because quantum advice can enhance the players' payoffs in these games.

Most of the quantum games are common interest games [\cite=GHZ] [\cite=magicsquare1] [\cite=magicsquare2] [\cite=hiddenmatching1] [\cite=hiddenmatching2] [\cite=CI08] [\cite=Bridge] [\cite=Iqbal15]. Common interest means that even each player's object is to maximize his/her own payoff regardless of the other players', their interests have no conflict. Thus they tend to cooperate as a team when playing common interest games. A team with quantum resources can outperform a team with only classical resources in quantum games. But more often in the real world players have conflicting interests and they tend to compete rather than cooperate. Can quantum resources offer an advantage to conflicting interest games? Recently, Pappa et al. [\cite=Pappa] proposes the first conflicting interest game where quantum advice can enhance social optimality. They suggest that it would be interesting to find more conflicting interest games where quantum mechanics offers an advantage, for example when larger dimensions are used or in a multiparty setting. Later, Situ [\cite=Situ] proposes a conflicting interest game with ternary outputs where 3 - dimensional quantum systems are used to enhance social optimality. A conflicting interest quantum game with ternary inputs is also given [\cite=Situ].

In the present paper, we try to find conflicting interest games where quantum mechanics can enhance social optimality in a three-party setting. Specifically, we construct a new three-party conflicting interest game on the basis of the common interest GHZ game [\cite=GHZ], and show that quantum advice can enhances social optimality in this new game. In the GHZ game, the combination of the three players' inputs are promised to belong to a subset of the product of the individuals' input sets. It would be interesting to ask whether a similar game without this restriction still benefits from quantum advice. The answer is affirmative. We construct another three-party conflicting interest game without the input restriction and show that quantum advice can also enhance the social optimality in this game.

The remainder of the present paper is organized as follows: Section [\ref=review] reviews the original common interest GHZ game. Section [\ref=withpromise] gives our first game which is constructed on the basis of the GHZ game. Section [\ref=withoutpromise] gives our second game which is free from input restriction. Section [\ref=conclusion] is a brief conclusion.

The GHZ game

The GHZ game [\cite=GHZ] is usually used to illustrate the strangeness of quantum mechanics in many literatures. Here we extract a vivid description of the GHZ game from Ref. [\cite=Bacon]. "Alice, Bob, and Charlie, while out looking for Dave one day, found themselves trapped at the hands of an evil Wizard. The Wizard was evil because he liked to play games with his captives. But he wasn't so evil that he liked to play games that always resulted in the captives losing. On this day he decided to play the following game with his three captives. The three captives would be locked away in three separate rooms, without the ability to communicate with each other. The Wizard would then come around and give each of the captives a slip of paper with the letter X or Y written on the slip. At midnight, the captives are then to shout out either the value + 1 or the value - 1. The Wizard explains to the captives that either two of them have received Y's on their slips of paper or none of them have received Y's. The captives will win the game and be released if, when they are all given slips with X on them, the product of what they shout out is + 1, and if two of them were given Y slips, then the product of what they shout out must be - 1. Or to write it all down symbolically, there are four possible combinations of the letters on the slips, {XXX,XYY,YXY,YYX}, and the products of what they shout must be { + 1, - 1, - 1, - 1} for these corresponding slips. Now Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all told the rules to this game. They are allowed to conspire before they are locked away, but after they are locked away they are not allowed to communicate to each other. The question about this game we would like to answer is whether it is possible for Alice, Bob, and Charlie to devise a strategy to always win this game?"

It's well known that there's no way for the three players to win this game for sure by classical methods (restricted by the local hidden variable model). However, if they are able to share a GHZ state on the conspiring stage and take the particles with them to their separate rooms, they can choose suitable measurement settings according to the letters they received and then shout out their measurement outcomes of their particles, which always satisfy the winning condition. Quantum resources help the team to win with probability 100%. Therefore the GHZ game demonstrates that shared entanglement can generate some correlations that cannot be explained by the local hidden variable model in a three-party setting.

Now we rephrase the rules of the GHZ game in a game-theoretic framework to facilitate the discussions in the following sections. The GHZ game involves three players and two stages. On the conspiring stage, the three players can discuss and agree on a strategy about what values they should output on the later stage. They can utilize some resources (classical or quantum) to help them to realize the strategy, but resources that can help them to communicate (e.g. cellphones) are forbidden. On the responding stage, the three players each receive one input which is either X or Y from an arbitrator. The combination of the three inputs is promised to belong to the set {XXX,XYY,YXY,YYX}. Each player only knows his/her own input but not the other players', and they are not allowed to communicate. Then they each produce one output which is either + 1 or - 1, according to the predetermined strategy. In the case where the inputs are XXX, the players each obtain a payoff of 1 if the product of their outputs is + 1, and obtain a payoff of 0 if the product is - 1. In the case where the inputs are XYY, YXY, or YYX, the players each obtain a payoff of 1 if the product of their outputs is - 1, and obtain a payoff of 0 if the product is + 1. The mapping from the inputs and the outputs to the payoffs can be expressed as a payoff function $:{XXX,XYY,YXY,YYX}  ×  { + 1, - 1}  ×  { + 1, - 1}  ×  { + 1, - 1}  →  {0,1}, which is defined as follows:

[formula]

for every s∈{XYY,YXY,YYX}, where a,b,c denote Alice, Bob and Charlie's outputs respectively.

Three-party conflicting interest quantum game with promised inputs

This section presents our first three-party conflicting interest quantum game where the inputs are promised to belong to the set {XXX,XYY,YXY,YYX}, like the GHZ game. Our game has the same structure as the GHZ game, except for different payoff functions $A,$B,$C for Alice, Bob and Charlie. We define the three payoff functions as follows:

[formula]

for every s∈{XYY,YXY,YYX}. The values in the triples refer to Alice, Bob and Charlie's payoffs respectively. In order to analyse this game, we first calculate the expected payoffs because there are four possible combinations of inputs. Now we write down the expected payoffs A,B,C for Alice, Bob and Charlie:

[formula]

where the first summation is done over s∈{XXX,XYY,YXY,YYX}. In the present paper we assume [formula] for every s∈{XXX,XYY,YXY,YYX}, that is, the four possible combinations of inputs are uniformly distributed. If the players only use classical advice, the conditional probability distribution Pr(a,b,c|s) is generated by

[formula]

where aX is the value Alice determines to output if she receives X, aY,bX,bY,cX,cY are defined analogously. The predetermined six-tuple (aX,aY,bX,bY,cX,cY) tells each player what value to output according to the input, so it forms a deterministic strategy, while a distribution of all possible tuples (aX,aY,bX,bY,cX,cY) forms a probabilistic strategy. The distribution can be built and sampled during the conspiring stage before the players are locked away. The idea of the above classical strategy accords with the local hidden variable model, and it's usually called "classical advice".

The expected payoff functions A,B,C are actually functions of six arguments aX,aY,bX,bY,cX,cY. If we list all the 64 possible combinations of these arguments, we can see that the maximum of the total expected payoff (social optimal outcome) is 3. To see whether the players have conflicting interests, we employ the concept of equilibrium [\cite=gametheory], which is actually a steady combination of the players' actions. Steady means that each player cannot obtain a higher payoff by deviating from his/her action that appears in the equilibrium, as long as the other players keep their actions that appear in the equilibrium unchanged. For our game, equilibria with expected payoffs [formula] and [formula] fulfil Alice's preference, equilibria with expected payoffs [formula] and [formula] fulfil Bob's preference, equilibria with expected payoffs [formula] and [formula] fulfil Charlie's preference. However, no one equilibrium can fulfil all three players' preferences, so conflicting interests rise.

Now we add up all the three players' payoffs to get the total payoff

[formula]

for every s∈{XYY,YXY,YYX}. This total payoff function is the same as the common payoff function of the original GHZ game except for a factor of 4. If the players are able to share a GHZ state on the conspiring stage and take their parts of the state to their separate rooms, they can measure their particles in a suitable measurement setting according to the inputs, and then output the measurement outcomes. We say they're using "quantum advice". Because the measurement outcomes always lead to a winning condition no matter what the inputs are, using quantum advice enhances the total expected payoff from 3 to 4, a better social optimal outcome is achieved. Notice that using quantum advice still prevents the players from communicating because manipulation of one part of the shared entanglement doesn't change the density matrix of other parts.

For completeness we include the measurement settings [\cite=Bacon] used in this game. If the players are given an X, they measure their particle in the [formula] basis (the eigenstates of the Pauli X operator) and if they get outcome | + 〉, then they say + 1 and if they get outcome | - 〉, then they say - 1. Similarly if they are given a Y, they measure their particle in the [formula] basis (the eigenstates of the Pauli Y operator) and if they get outcome | + i〉, then they say + 1 and if they get outcome | - i〉, then they say - 1. The expected payoffs QA,QB,QC for Alice, Bob and Charlie with quantum advice are

[formula]

where the conditional probabilities Pr Q(a,b,c|s) are the probabilities of measurement outcomes of the GHZ state [formula]. For instance,

[formula]

By straightforward calculation we have

[formula]

for every s∈{XYY,YXY,YYX}. Thus the expected payoffs for the three players are [formula] which is fair to them.

Three-party conflicting interest quantum game with all inputs

In the previous section we construct a conflicting interest quantum game on the basis of the common interest GHZ game where the inputs are promised to belong to a subset of the eight possible combinations of X and Y. Now we come to the question whether quantum advice can enhance social optimality in a similar three-party conflicting interest game where all the eight combinations of X and Y are allowable. The answer is affirmative and we give an example in this section. The payoff functions of this game are defined as follows:

[formula]

for every s∈{XYY,YXY,YYX} and s'∈{YXX,XYX,XXY}. The expected payoff functions are the same as those defined in Eq. ([\ref=expectedpayoff]), but the summation is done over all eight possible combinations of X and Y. We assume the eight possible combination of inputs are uniformly distributed. If we list all the 64 possible combinations of arguments (aX,aY,bX,bY,cX,cY), we can see that the maximum of the total expected payoff with classical advice is 3. Equilibria with expected payoffs [formula] fulfil Alice's preference. Equilibria with expected payoffs [formula] fulfil Bob's preference. Equilibria with expected payoffs [formula] fulfil Charlie's preference. However, no one equilibrium can fulfil all the three players' preferences, so they have conflicting interests.

We add up all the three players' payoffs to get the total payoff

[formula]

for every s∈S-  =  {YYY,XYY,YXY,YYX} and s'∈S+  =  {XXX,YXX,XYX,XXY}. The total expected payoff function can be written as

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the expected value of the product of the outputs given that the inputs are s.

Let K = E(XXX) + E(YXX) + E(XYX) + E(XXY) - E(YYY) - E(XYY) - E(YXY) - E(YYX). If we regard X and Y as two Pauli operators, and E(s) as the expected value of the product of the measurement outcomes of the three observables appearing in s, then K is actually the Bell expression of the Svetlichny inequality [\cite=Svetlichny]. The classical bound for the Svetlichny inequality is 4 and the quantum violation is 5.66. If the players use quantum advice to generate Pr Q(a,b,c|s), the total expected payoff can be enhanced from 3 to 3.415, a better social optimal outcome is achieved. We have checked that the quantum state and the measurement settings [\cite=Svetlichny] for the quantum violation result in a fair allocation of payoff. The expected payoffs for the three players are (1.138,1.138,1.138).

Conclusion

Games have been widely used to explain quantum mechanics and demonstrate the advantage of quantum mechanics. Conflicting interest games are seldom studied in the context of quantum pseudo-telepathy games. Recently some authors [\cite=Pappa] [\cite=Situ] have given new examples of two-party conflicting interest games where quantum advice enhances social optimality. The present paper has given two new three-party conflicting interest games of this genre. The first one is related to the original common interest GHZ game [\cite=GHZ], while the second one is related to the Svetlichny inequality [\cite=Svetlichny]. The future work is to find more conflicting games where quantum mechanics offers an advantage, for example when larger than 3-dimensional quantum systems are used or in a more than 3-party setting.
