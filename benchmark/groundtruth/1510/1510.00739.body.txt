Rings of C2H in the Molecular Disks Orbiting TW Hya and V4046 Sgr

Introduction

Our single-dish radio telescope molecular line surveys of the evolved protoplanetary disks orbiting the nearby, actively accreting T Tauri star systems TW Hya and V4046 Sgr established that both display strong C2H line emission ([\cite=2014ApJ...793...55K]). As C2H is likely the dissociation product of more complex hydrocarbons and organics, it potentially provides a diagnostic of disk irradiation by high-energy (UV and X-ray) photons generated via accretion and coronal activity at the central T Tauri stars. With this as motivation, we have used the Submillimeter Array (SMA) to image, at ~  1'' resolution, C2H(3-2) emission from the TW Hya and V4046 Sgr disks.

SMA observations of C2H emission from TW Hya and V4046 Sgr

TW Hya: The results of SMA imaging of C2H emission from this single, nearby (D = 54 pc) ~  0.8 [formula] T Tauri star -- the namesake of the ~  8 Myr-old TW Hya Association -- are reported in [\cite=2015arXiv150405980K]. These observations have revealed that the C2H line surface brightness exhibits a ring-like emission morphology, with an inner hole of radius ~  45 AU (Fig. [\ref=fig:TWHyaC2H]). Based on comparison of the SMA C2H imaging results for TW Hya with previous continuum and line emission imaging and spectroscopy of that disk, it appears that the C2H abundance is enhanced in warm, low-density, disk surface layers that lie beyond the CO "ice line" (as traced by N2H+ emission; Fig. [\ref=fig:TWHyaC2H]).

V4046 Sgr: This close (~  2.4-day) binary system, a member of the ~  20 Myr-old Î² Pic Moving Group, consists of nearly equal, ~  0.9 [formula] components ([\cite=2012ApJ...759..119R]). The circumbinary molecular disk orbiting V4046 Sgr is somewhat larger than that of TW Hya (R  ~  350 AU vs. R  ~  200 AU; [\cite=2012ApJ...759..119R]; [\cite=2013Sci...341..630Q]), and -- in contrast to the nearly pole-on TW Hya -- is viewed at intermediate inclination ([formula]; Rosenfeld et al. 2012). Extended- and compact-configuration SMA observations of C2H(3-2) emission from the V4046 Sgr disk were acquired in 2015 March and May, respectively; the resulting image is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:V4046SgrC2H]. It is evident that V4046 Sgr, like TW Hya, displays a ring-like C2H morphology, but with a more asymmetric appearance (perhaps due to its intermediate disk inclination) and somewhat larger inner C2H "hole" radius (~  70 AU).

Remarks

We (K15) have proposed that the C2H ring in the TW Hya disk may trace particularly efficient photo-destruction of small grains and/or photodesorption and photodissociation of hydrocarbons (principally, C2H2) derived from grain ice mantles in the surface layers of the outer disk. Comparative modeling of the two SMA datasets will establish whether the V4046 Sgr C2H ring is in fact larger and more asymmetric than that of TW Hya and, more generally, should shed further light on the mechanism(s) responsible for production of C2H in evolved, protoplanetary disks.
