Purely Infinite Totally Disconnected Topological Graph Algebras

Introduction

The Elliott program developed rapidly over the last twenty years with the goal of classifying all simple separable nuclear C*-algebras by the so-called Elliott's invariants (Notice that different types of classification might have different invariants). In the purely infinite case, Kirchberg in [\cite=Kirchbergclassification] and Phillips in [\cite=Phillips:DM00] separately showed that all simple separable nuclear purely infinite C*-algebras in the UCT class can be classified by their K-theoretic data. Katsura in [\cite=Katsura:JFA08] gave a sufficient condition on simple topological graph algebras such that they are purely infinite, and constructed all simple separable nuclear purely infinite C*-algebras in the UCT class.

Graph algebras were firstly defined by Kumjian, Pask, Raeburn, and Renault in [\cite=KumjianPaskEtAl:JFA97] using the groupoid C*-algebras method. Topological graph algebras studied by Katsura (see [\cite=Katsura:TAMS04]), which are seen to be a generalization of graph algebras, were defined by using a modified version of Pimsner's construction (see [\cite=Pimsner:FIC97]). A few people then tried to realize topological graph algebras as groupoid C*-algebras, and these results can naturally be regarded as a generalization of Kumjian, Pask, Raeburn, and Renault's approach to graph algebras in [\cite=KumjianPaskEtAl:JFA97]. For example, Katsura in [\cite=MR2563503] showed that the topological graph algebra of a compact topological graph with a surjective range map is isomorphic to a Renault-Deaconu groupoid C*-algebra. Yeend in [\cite=Yeend:CM06] proved that every topological graph algebra is indeed an étale groupoid C*-algebra. Kumjian and Li recently in [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2] strengthened Yeend's result by showing that every topological graph algebra is indeed a Renault-Deaconu groupoid C*-algebra (Yeend's result, and Kumjian and Li's result both cover a result of Brownlowe, Carlsen, and Whittaker from [\cite=BCW]).

In this article, we give a sufficient condition on totally disconnected topological graphs such that their associated topological graph algebras are purely infinite. Our approach is different than Katsura's. Our strategy is that we deal with topological graph algebras under the groupoid model, and we apply Anantharaman-Delaroche's criterion in [\cite=MR1478030], which yields purely infinite étale groupoid C*-algebras, to our settings.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a background review on topological graph algebras and state the main theorem of [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2]. In Section 3, we prove our main theorem, that is Theorem [\ref=sufficient_condition_1_for_boundary_path_groupoid_loc_con], which is a sufficient condition giving rise to purely infinite topological graph algebras. In Section 4, we give some remarks on our main theorem.

Preliminaries

Throughout this paper, all the topological spaces are assumed to be second countable; and all the topological groupoids are assumed to be second countable. Our work in this article utilizes the Hilbert module, the C*-correspondence, and the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra machinery. These materials can be referred to [\cite=Katsura:JFA04] [\cite=Lance:Hilbert$C*$-modules95] [\cite=Pimsner:FIC97] [\cite=RaeburnWilliams:Moritaequivalenceand98], etc. This paper also involves groupoids, groupoid C*-algebras, which can be found in [\cite=Renault:groupoidapproachto80].

Topological Graph Algebras

In this subsection, we recap some background about topological graphs and topological graph algebras from [\cite=Katsura:TAMS04] [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2].

Let T be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Then T is said to be totally disconnected if T has an open base consisting of compact open subsets of T.

A quadruple E = (E0,E1,r,s) is called a topological graph if E0,E1 are locally compact Hausdorff spaces, r:E1  →  E0 is a continuous map, and s:E1  →  E0 is a local homeomorphism. In addition, E is said to be totally disconnected if E0,E1 are both totally disconnected.

Let E be a topological graph. For x,y∈Cc(E1),f∈C0(E0),e∈E1, and for v∈E0, define

[formula]

Then Cc(E1) is a right inner product C0(E0)-module with an adjointable left C0(E0)-action. Its completion X(E) under the ||  ·  ||C0(E0)-norm is called the graph correspondence associated to E. The Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of X(E), which is denote by O(E), is called the topological graph algebra of E.

A subset N of E1 is called an s-section if s|N:N  →  s(N) is a homeomorphism with respect to the subspace topologies.

Define some useful subsets of E0 as follows. Define

[formula] there exists an open neighborhood N of v such that [formula] is compact }.

[formula].

For n  ≥  2, define

[formula]

regarded as a subspace of the product space [formula]. Define the finite-path space [formula] with the disjoint union topology. Define the infinite-path space

[formula]

Denote the length of a path [formula] by |μ|.

A finite path [formula] is called a cycle if r(μ) = s(μ). The vertex r(μ) is called the base point of μ. The cycle μ is said to be without entrances if r- 1(r(μi)) = {μi}, for [formula]. On the other hand, the cycle μ is said to have entrances if there exists 1  ≤  i  ≤  |μ| such that r- 1(r(μi))  ≠  {μi}.

Let E be a topological graph. Then E is said to be topologically free if the set of base points of cycles without entrances has empty interior.

Let E be a topological graph. Define the boundary path space to be [formula]. For a subset S  ⊂  E*, define the cylinder set by [formula]. Define a locally compact Hausdorff topology on ∂E to be generated by the basic open sets [formula], where U is an open set of E* and K is a compact set of E*.

By [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2], the one-sided shift map [formula] is a local homeomorphism.

Groupoid C*-algebras

In this subsection, we state one of the main theorems of [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2].

A topological groupoid is called a locally compact groupoid if its topology is locally compact Hausdorff. A locally compact groupoid is said to be étale if its range map is a local homeomorphism.

Let Γ be a locally compact groupoid and let N  ⊂  Γ. Then N is called an s-section if s|N:N  →  s(N) is a homeomorphism with respect to the subspace topologies; N is called an r-section if r|N:N  →  r(N) is a homeomorphism with respect to the subspace topologies; and N is called a bisection if s|N,r|N are both homeomorphisms with respect to the subspace topologies.

Let T be a locally compact Hausdorff space and let [formula] be a partial local homeomorphism. Define the Renault-Deaconu groupoid Γ(T,σ) as follows:

[formula]

Define the unit space Γ0: = {(t,0,t):t∈T}. For (t1,n,t2),(t2,m,t3)∈Γ(T,σ), define the multiplication, the inverse, the source and the range map by

[formula]

[formula]

Define the topology on Γ(T,σ) to be generated by the basic open set

[formula]

where [formula] are open in T,σk1 is injective on U, and σk2 is injective on V.

Let E be a topological graph. Define the boundary path groupoid to be the Renault-Deaconu groupoid

[formula]

The following theorem is a special case of [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2].

Let E be a topological graph. Then O(E) is isomorphic to the groupoid C*-algebra C*(Γ(∂E,σ)).

Sufficient Conditions of Purely Infinite Topological Graph Algebras

Let A be a C*-algebra. Then A is said to be purely infinite if every nonzero hereditary C*-subalgebra of A contains an infinite projection.

We firstly prove the following two technical lemmas.

Let E be a topological graph. Fix an open set U  ⊂  E*, and fix a compact set K  ⊂  E* satisfying [formula]. Write [formula] for some k  ≥  0. Then for any [formula] with |μ|  ≥  k, there exists an open subset V of E* such that [formula]. In particular, if |μ| = k, then V can be chosen to be an open neighborhood of μ in E|μ|.

We prove the first statement. Write μ  =  αβ where α∈U.

Case 1. [formula]. Let V: = U. Then we are done.

Case 2. [formula] and K  ⊂  E0. Then r(μ)∉K. Take an open neighborhood N of r(μ) which does not intersect with K. Let [formula]. We have [formula].

Case 3. [formula] and [formula]. Then k  ≥  1. Since μ∈Z(K)c, then for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k there exists an open neighborhood Ni  ⊂  Ei of [formula] such that Ni does not intersect with [formula] and r(Ni) does not intersect with [formula]. Let

[formula]

Then V is an open subset of Emax {|α|,k} and [formula].

We prove the second statement. If [formula], let

[formula]

Then V is an open neighborhood of μ in E|μ|, and [formula]. If [formula], then it follows directly from the above construction.

Let E be a topological graph. Suppose that [formula]. Then for any open set U  ⊂  E* and any compact set K  ⊂  E* satisfying [formula], there exists an open subset V of E* such that [formula].

The assumption [formula] gives [formula] [formula]. Fix an open set U  ⊂  E* and fix a compact set K  ⊂  E* satisfying [formula]. Write [formula], for some k  ≥  0. Fix [formula]. If |μ|  ≥  k then by Lemma [\ref=Technical_Lemma_1] we are done. So we may assume that |μ| < k. By Lemma [\ref=Technical_Lemma_1], there exists an open neighborhood V  ⊂  E|μ| of μ such that [formula]. Then s(V) is an open neighborhood of s(μ). Since μ∈∂E and [formula], we have [formula]. Consider the set

[formula]

which is a compact subset of E1. Then there exists e∈r- 1(s(V)) such that e∉F. Take an open neighborhood W  ⊂  E1 of e which does not intersect with F. Let

[formula]

So [formula].

Let Γ be an étale groupoid. Then Γ is said to be essentially free if the set of elements in Γ0 whose isotropy group are trivial form a dense subset of Γ0.

Let T be a locally compact Hausdorff space and let [formula] be a partial local homeomorphism. Then the Renault-Deaconu groupoid Γ(T,σ) is essentially free if and only if the set [formula] is dense in T.

It is straightforward to see.

Let E be a topological graph. Then E is said to be essentially free if the boundary path groupoid Γ(∂E,σ) is essentially free.

The following proposition is a generalization of [\cite=KumjianPaskEtAl:PJM98].

Let E be a topological graph. Then E is topologically free if and only if E is essentially free.

First of all, suppose that E is not essentially free. We aim to show that E is not topologically free. Since E is not essentially free, there exists a nonempty open set N  ⊂  ∂E which does not intersect with [formula] due to Lemma [\ref=equ_defn_of_essentially_free]. For each 0  ≤  p < q, define a closed subset of ∂E to be Bp,q: = {μ∈∂E:σp(μ) = σq(ν)}. For each 0  ≤  p < q, let [formula], then Ap,q is a closed subset of the subspace N. Notice that [formula] because N does not intersect with [formula]. By the Baire's category theorem, there exists a nonempty open subset O of N (O is also open in ∂E) contained in Ap0,q0 for some 1  ≤  p0 < q0. By Definition [\ref=def_of_boundary_path_of_top_graph], there exist an open set U  ⊂  E* and a compact set K  ⊂  E* such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=Technical_Lemma_1], there exist n  ≥  0 and an open subset V  ⊂  En such that [formula]. We may assume that n  ≠  0. Let [formula]. Then Z(W)  ⊂  Z(V). So Z(W)  ⊂  Ap0,q0. We deduce that every μ∈Z(W) satisfies that σn + p0(μ) = σn + q0(μ) since μ∈Ap0,q0. [\cite=Katsura:TAMS04] assures that for each α∈W there exists μ∈Z(W) such that μ  =  αβ. We then conclude that s(W) is an open subset of E0 consisting of base points of cycles. We claim that s(W) consists of base points of cycles without entrances. Suppose not, for a contradiction. We obtain two infinite paths αβ,αβ'∈Z(W), where α∈W,β1  ≠  β2. Since [formula] are cycles, [formula], which is a contradiction. Hence s(W) is an open subset of E0 consisting of base points of cycles. Therefore E is not topologically free.

Conversely suppose that E is essentially free. Suppose that E is not topologically free, for a contradiction. By Lemma [\ref=equ_defn_of_essentially_free], the set [formula] is dense in ∂E. By [\cite=Katsura:ETDS06], there exist a nonempty open set V  ⊂  E0 consisting of base points of cycles without entrances, and a homeomorphism σ on V such that [formula]. By [\cite=Katsura:TAMS04], [formula]. Fix a vertex v∈V. Let ν be the unique simple cycle such that r(ν) = v. By the assumption, there is a convergent sequence [formula] with the limit ν. By [\cite=KumjianLiTwisted2], r(ν(n))  →  r(ν) = v, and so there exists N  ≥  1 such that r(ν(N))∈V. Let α be the unique simple cycle with r(α) = r(ν(N)). Since V consists of base points of cycles without entrances and [formula], we deduce that [formula], which is a contradiction. So E is topologically free.

Let Γ be an étale groupoid. Then Γ is said to be locally contracting if for any nonempty open set U  ⊂  Γ0, there exist an open subset V  ⊂  U and an open bisection N  ⊂  Γ such that [formula] and [formula].

Let E be a topological graph. Then E is said to be locally contracting if the boundary path groupoid Γ(∂E,σ) is locally contracting.

Let E be a topological graph and let v∈E0. Then v is said to connect to a cycle if there exists u∈E0 such that [formula] and u is the base point of a cycle.

The following theorem is a generalization of partial results from [\cite=KumjianPaskEtAl:PJM98].

Let E be a topologically free totally disconnected topological graph. Suppose that the following subset of E0 is dense in E0.

[formula]

Then E is essentially free and locally contracting. Hence O(E) is purely infinite.

Since E is topologically free, we have E is essentially free by Proposition [\ref=top_free_iff_ess_free].

We claim that [formula]. Suppose that [formula], for a contradiction. Fix [formula]. Then there exists an open neighborhood V of v not intersecting with [formula]. By the assumption of the proposition, there exists u∈V such that u connects to the base point of a cycle with entrances, which is impossible. So [formula] and we finish proving the claim.

Now we prove that E is locally contracting. Fix a nonempty open set N  ⊂  ∂E. By Definition [\ref=def_of_boundary_path_of_top_graph], there exist an open set U  ⊂  E* and a compact set K  ⊂  E* such that [formula]. Since [formula], by Lemma [\ref=Technical_Lemma_2] there exists a nonempty open subset V of E* such that [formula]. Then s(V) is a nonempty open subset of E0. By the assumption, there exist μνeβ,μναeβ∈∂E such that μ∈V,α is a cycle, and e  ≠  α1. Take an open s|μν|-section O1 such that μν∈O1 and Z(O1)  ⊂  Z(V); and take an open s|α|-section O2 containing α such that O2 consists of cycles and e∉{α1':α'∈O2}. Since E is totally disconnected, we may assume that O1,O2 are compact open. Define a clopen bisection of the boundary path groupoid Γ(∂E,σ) as follows.

[formula]

Let us only consider the case |μν| > 0, since the other case shares the same argument. Then V: = s(S) is a clopen subset contained in Z(O1). For any μ'ν'β'∈V where |μ'|  =  |μ|,|ν'|  =  |ν|, there exists a unique [formula] where |μ''|  =  |μ|,|ν''|  =  |ν|,|α''|  =  |α|, such that (μ'ν'β',|μν|  -  |μνα|,μ''ν''α''β'')∈S- 1. So α'' is a cycle and (μ''ν''α''β'',|μν|  -  |μνα|,μ''ν''α''α''β'')∈S- 1. Hence [formula]. Also notice that μ''ν''α''β''  ≠  μνeβ because e∉{α1':α'∈O2}. Therefore [formula]. By Definition [\ref=define_loc_contracting_top_graph], Γ(∂E,σ) is locally contracting.

By Theorem [\ref=groupid_model_for_twisted_top_graph_alg], O(E) is isomorphic with C*(Γ(∂E,σ)). Since E is essentially free and locally contracting, [\cite=MR1478030] gives O(E) is purely infinite.

Concluding Remarks

Katsura in [\cite=Katsura:JFA08] defined a concept called contracting topological graphs which can provide purely infinite topological graph algebras. We recall the definition of contracting topological graphs and state Katsura's result.

Let E be a topological graph. A nonempty open set V  ⊂  E0 is said to be contracting if V is precompact and there exists a finite family of nonempty open sets {Ui  ⊂  Eni:ni  ≥  1}ki = 1 satisfying the following.

[formula];

for i  ≠  j,ni  ≤  nj, we have [formula]; and

[formula].

Moreover, E is said to be contracting at a vertex v∈E0 if [formula] and every open neighborhood of v0 contains a contracting open set. Furthermore, E is said to be contracting if E is contracting at some vertex in E0.

Let E be a topological graph. Suppose that O(E) is simple. If E is contracting then O(E) is purely infinite.

Katsura in [\cite=Katsura:JFA08] asked that whether the converse of Theorem [\ref=contracting_minimal_gives_PI] is true. We gave a counterexample of the converse statement.

Katsura's criterion of topological graph algebras being purely infinite relies on the assumption of the given topological graph algebras being simple. Our approach does not but pay the price that we have to assume that the starting topological graphs are totally disconnected.
