Voyager 2 solar plasma and magnetic field spectral analysis for intermediate data sparsity

Introduction

The solar wind fills the heliosphere from the Sun to the termination shock with a supersonic flow of magnetized plasma. This flow is time-dependent on all scales and expands with distance. The flow has fluctuations on a broad range of scales and frequencies. These fluctuations are not just convected outward but show energy cascades between the different scales. The solar wind turbulence phenomenology has been comprehensively reviewed by [\cite=tu1995] [\cite=bruno2013].

Most studies of solar wind turbulence use data from near-Earth, with spacecraft in the ecliptic near 1 AU, see [\cite=tu1995]. Recent studies of the solar wind near 1 AU found the fluctuations in magnetic field are fit by power laws with exponents of -5/3 while those of velocity often show exponents of -3/2 [\cite=podesta2007]. The Ulysses spacecraft provided the first observations of turbulence near the solar polar regions [\cite=horbury2001]; hourly-average Ulysses data show that the velocity power law exponent evolves toward -5/3 with distance from the Sun, and that spectra at 1 AU are far from the asymptotic state [\citep=roberts2010]. In order to understand the evolution of the solar wind and its properties, it is necessary to analyze data at larger radial distances. However, data gaps typically increase with distance and make the spectral analysis challenging.

In this paper Voyager 2 (V2) plasma and magnetic field data from near 5 AU are used to study the structure of turbulence in the solar wind. Voyager 2 was launched in August 23, 1977 and reached a distance of 5 AU in the first half of 1979 (just before the Jupiter fly-by. V2 closest approach to Jupiter was on July 9). We use data from January 1 to June 29, 1979 (DOY 1 - 180) . The Voyager plasma experiment observes plasma currents in the energy/charge range 10 - 5950 eV /q using four modulated-grid Faraday cup detectors [\citep=bridge1977]. The observed currents are fit to convected isotropic proton Maxwellian distributions to derive the parameters (velocity, density, and temperature) used in this work. Magnetic field and plasma data are from the COHOWeb repository (http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/coho/) of the Space Physics Data Facility. In 1979 data gaps are due mainly to tracking gaps; some smaller gaps are due to interference from other instruments. As a consequence, datasets from Voyager 2 are lacunous and irregularly distributed. In order to perform spectral analysis, methods for signal reconstruction of missing data must be implemented.

In section two we present the physical behavior of the solar wind near 5 AU through statistical analysis and plasma parameters. Section three gives an overview of the signal context we work with and of the reconstruction techniques used. In section four we show and discuss the spectra analysis performed about kinetic energy, density and thermal speed. Conclusions and future development follow in section five. Supplementary Information provides practical details on the software used carry out the gapped data analysis.

1979 DAY 1-180 Voyager 2 data. Probability density function and intermittency. Limitation toward spectral analysis

The dataset consists of vector plasma velocity and magnetic field data from 01/01/1979 00:00 GMT to 06/29/1979 19:00 GMT, a period of about 180 days. In 1979 the plasma speed and direction were sampled each 96 s, while for magnetic field the resolution of the data we use is 48 s (the actual sampling frequency is higher than 0.1 Hz).

In this period the solar wind was mainly slow, with a mean velocity VSW equal to 454 km / s and relatively high levels of fluctuation, see table [\ref=parameter]. The slow wind is characterized by magnetic fluctuations generally comparable to the mean field, with values of the magnetic energy ([formula]) greater than the kinetic energy ([formula]) [\citep=marsch1990a] [\citep=mccomas1998]; the average Alfvén ratio rA in the period is about 0.862. In the same table other characteristic plasma frequencies and scales are reported. A plot of the data is shown in figure [\ref=fig:data_zoom], where the fluctuations of the components of plasma velocity and Alfvén velocity are represented using the RTN Heliographic reference system. The RTN system is centered at the spacecraft, the R (radial) axis is directed radially away from the Sun through the spacecraft. The T (tangential) axis is the cross product of the Sun's spin vector (North directed) and the R axis, i.e. the T axis is parallel to the solar equatorial plane and is positive in the direction of planetary rotation around the Sun. The N (normal) axis completes the right handed set). The top panel of the figure magnifies 4 days of data to show the typical data gap distribution.

The anisotropy of the fields can be determined by looking at the single components probability density functions (PDFs) in figure [\ref=fig:pdf], panels (a-c). Particularly important are the differences of the radial components compared to the tangential and normal ones: a quantification of the anisotropy can be appreciated by comparing the skewness values in table [\ref=tab:pdf]. The presence of intermittency in the velocity and magnetic fields can be also observed by looking at the PDFs of the modules of the normalized vector fields, shown in figure [\ref=fig:pdf] (d). The normalized vector fields are given by

[formula]

where μi is the mean value and σ2i the variance of the i-th component of the vector field [formula]. The same plot shows a three-component chi-square distribution as a reference. Intermittency occurs over a broad range of scales and seems to be slightly higher in the magnetic field data which has larger skewness and kurtosis (see table [\ref=tab:pdf]).

In order to analyze anisotropic effects from a spectral point of view, it is important to identify the wave-numbers parallel to the magnetic field [formula] and normal to it [formula], as suggested first by [\cite=montgomery1987]. We consider the angle ψ between the local vector field and the radial direction, defined as

[formula]

The PDFs of these angles are represented in panel a of figure [\ref=fig:pdf]: while the average plasma velocity is oriented along the radial direction (the mean angle is [formula] radiant), moving away from the sun, the magnetic field is characterized by angles close to π / 2 which make it perpendicular to the radial direction as expected for a Parker spiral.

Since data collected in time can be interpreted as if they were measured along the radial direction (the solar wind is radial, and the probe motion is very low compared with the wind velocity), the perpendicular wave-number can be identified by using the relation

[formula]

where vSW is the mean plasma velocity and [formula] are the wave-numbers normal to the mean magnetic field. This approximation can be considered valid since the radial direction is normal to the mean magnetic field, as shown in panel a of figure [\ref=fig:pdf].

Data reconstruction methods for long term temporal spectra analysis

Data sparsity represents one of the major challenges to spectral analysis. Figure [\ref=fig:generale] presents the general context of gapped data treatment including details of the role played by measurement accuracy, numerical precision, presence of noise and related energy addition. The gap distribution of the V2 velocity and magnetic field data is shown in the insert of panel a of figure [\ref=fig:generale]. In the 180-day period analyzed, 28% and 24% of plasma and magnetic field data are missing, respectively. Naming δt the time difference between consecutive data points, the biggest gap is δtmax  =  44.7 hours, and the total number of points is 115102 for the velocity and density, 248159 for the magnetic field. The longest continuous data subset lasts Ts = 19.5 hours and it is located at DOY 176 and 168 for plasma and magnetic fields, respectively. In the following, the temporal length of a data gap is named Tg.

In order to test different spectral analysis procedures, two different 180-day reference numerical datasets have been prepared that mimic the V2 data in terms of integral scale and sampling period. The datasets are called synthetic turbulence 1 and 2 and were prepared by analogy to that of a scalar field which has a power spectrum similar to the typical one-dimensional spectrum of an hydrodynamical homogeneous and isotropic turbulent field, see [\citet=monin_book]. The two reference fields contain

Synt 1 : an energy injection range and an inertial range

Synt 2 : an energy injection range, an inertial range and a dissipative range.

In these synthetic reference datasets, the energy injection range follows a power law with exponent in the interval 2  ±  1.5, the spectral maximum is placed at a frequency corresponding to one solar day, the inertial range extends over three and a half decades and has a power decay equal to  - 5 / 3  ±  1, and the dissipative range is placed around 5  ·  10- 3 Hertz and has a maximum decay of -3. Furthermore, the phases of the harmonic components have been uniformly randomized.

In the following, we show results for an energy injection rate of 2 and a inertial decay rate of -5/3. However, for all exponents in the above intervals, the same good behaviour is shown by all the gap compensation methods here presented.

These sequences have been made sparse by giving them the same gap distribution as the Voyager 2 data. The spectra of these reference synthetic datasets are represented with black curves in figure [\ref=fig:method] which illustrates the behavior of four techniques for spectral analysis of lacunous data: i) windowed averaged Fourier transforms of linearly interpolated data subsets; ii) Fourier transform of the correlation function; iii) maximum likelihood recovery by [\cite=rybicki1992a]; iv) spectral estimation via compressed sensing (see e.g. [\cite=donoho2006] [\cite=candes2006]).

Results from the first technique are shown in panels (a,b) of figure [\ref=fig:method] for different values of Tg, which is the maximum size of the gap where data are interpolated. The low-pass behavior of the interpolator results in a steepening of the spectrum, especially in the high frequency range, and becomes much more evident as Tg increases. For Synt1, the relative error on the spectral index α lies between 1.9% (Tg = 0.5 hrs) and 5.4% (Tg = 4 hrs) in the range f∈[10 -  5,10 -  3], while in the last frequency decade it increases up to 8% for Tg = 0.5 hrs. For Synt2, the discrepancy lies between 0.4% (Tg = 0.5 hrs) and 2.4% (Tg = 4 hrs) in the range f∈[10 -  5,10 -  3]. The Hann windowing is applied to reduce the noise effect due to the segmentation, i.e. jumps in the values at the segments boundaries resulting in ≈  1 / f noise (see panel b, pink curve).

The other three techniques allow recovery of the full-frequency spectra, see panels (c,d) of figure [\ref=fig:method]. To all these spectra a light smoothing has been applied homogeneously over the entire spectral range using a 9-point running average. The computation of the two-point correlation function is highly affected by the sparsity of data. As a result, the spectrum of the correlation function computed from the original gapped data (orange curves) is not physically significant. The peaks are entirely due to the gap distribution; causality is shown by the comparison with the Fourier transform of a boolean characteristic function Φ, which is zero-valued where the data are missing (cyan curves). The correlation function computed from linearly interpolated data in the full-period leads to much better convergence, leading to the spectra represented in pink. The maximum likelihood reconstruction is a non-deterministic recovery, even though it is constrained by the true data where these are available. A complete description of the technique is given by [\cite=rybicki1992a] and an application can by found in [\cite=rybicki1992b]. It requires an estimation of the two-point correlation function and it also allows one to account for noise in data. We used the same correlations computed for the previous method. In this case the size of filled gaps Tg is a parameter to be chosen, and here the goodness of the correlation function allows us to recover the full sequence (green spectra).

Compressed sensing (CS in the following, [\cite=donoho2006] [\cite=candes2006]) is a recent theory that provides guarantees for the reconstruction of (exactly or approximately) sparse signals, namely signals with many null (or approximately null) components, from linear, compressed measurements. In mathematical terms, CS studies the underdetermined linear system [formula], where A is matrix of size m  ×  n with m < n, and [formula] and [formula] have consistent dimensions. The available data vector [formula] is then a linear compression of the unknown [formula], which is assumed to be sparse. CS theory provides conditions that make such problems well posed, that is, with a unique solution. In particular, much effort has been devoted to study which families of sensing matrices A guarantee the possibility of recovery. Among these, partial Fourier matrices (say, discrete Fourier transform matrices with missing rows) have been recently studied (see, e.g., [\cite=rud06] [\cite=dua11] [\cite=xu15]), motivated in particular by the applications in medical imaging problems such as MRI [\cite=lus08]. In the mentioned works, theoretical guarantees on partial Fourier matrices for CS are provided, in terms of the number of necessary measurements and positioning of the missing rows. The problem of spectrum recovery from missing data can be interpreted as an undetermined linear system [formula] where A is a partial Fourier matrix, [formula] is the vector of lacunous data, and [formula] is the spectrum to recover. Such a spectrum can be considered as an approximation of the spectrum of the physical signal and will have a level of sparsity increasing proportionally to the number of gaps in the data. This fact can be accepted since the density of information in the time series is sufficient to allow a quantitative estimate of the power spectral distribution and in particular of the related power decay in the range of frequencies recovered. The CS approach allows to perform spectral analysis with no previous interpolation of the lacunous data. On the other hand, once the spectrum [formula] is estimated, one can perform an inversion of the Fourier transform and obtain an estimate of the data without gaps. CS provides the theoretical tools to tackle our recovery problem. Moreover, it is also feasible in practice, even when data sets are large. Specifically, in this work we formulated the problem as a Basis Pursuit and obtained the numerical solution through the SPGL1 Matlab solver for sparse problems (see [\cite=spgl07] for theoretical and practical details). SPGL1 is suitable for the Fourier framework, as it deals with complex variables. Moreover, it allows us to cope with data of large dimension, since the sensing matrix A can be defined as function instead of explicitly storing the whole matrix.

The relative error in the spectral slope, with respect to the true value (black curves) for these three methods is below 2.4%, in the range f∈[null] of Synt1, and f∈[10 -  6,10 -  3] of Synt2.

Plasma and magnetic field spectra

The spectra obtained for each component of magnetic field and plasma velocity are represented in figure [\ref=fig:component]. It should be noted that all the gap recovery methods converge at similar exponent, as shown in Fig S 1 of Supplementary Information.

Looking at the power spectra of each component of the velocity field, shown in the top panels of figure [\ref=fig:component] and resumed in table [\ref=tab:data_exponent] (a), the behavior of the system at low frequencies ([formula]) shows that the exponent is steeper for the radial component rather than the other two. In particular, the spectral index in the radial direction is αvR  ≈   - 2.00. Considering that these frequency spectra can be interpreted as perpendicular-wavenumber spectra (see eq. [\ref=eq:perp]), a slope of about 2 for the radial component can identify an inertial range of anisotropic weak MHD turbulence [\citep=galtier2000] with relevant effects of parallel sweeping (interaction between coherent structures of different scales, see [\cite=zhou2004]). At high frequencies, the situation is reversed and the spectral index of the radial component is αvR  ≈   - 1.18, smaller than the other two (αvT  ≈   - 1.28, αvN  ≈   - 1.48). Considering the power spectrum of the kinetic energy, the exponent found is αEk  ≈   - 1.67 in the low frequency domain. Such a value is consistent with the Kolmogorov theory, which predicts an exponent of -5/3 (see also [\citet=marsch89]). In the high frequency range, for f∈[null] the fit gives the value of αEk  ≈   - 1.33. As pointed out by [\cite=matt89] and reviewed by [\cite=zhou2004], energy spectra exponents ranging from - 5 / 3 to - 3 / 2 can indicate the presence of Alfvénic waves. For high frequencies, we can consider that the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan MHD cascade model (spectral index of -3/2) indicates a quasi 2D behavior of the field. As shown by [\cite=matt89], lower exponents (as the αEk  ≈   - 1.26 such as those found for [formula]) are typical of weak turbulence, in which the field is characterized by strong mean values and relatively small fluctuations and in which nonlinear interactions are not relevant. The flattening in the velocity spectra at high frequencies has been observed by other authors [\cite=matthaeus1982b] [\cite=roberts2010]. The first paper pointed out that the flattening may be due to aliasing, but the second paper excluded this hypothesis. This flattening was also found for the proton density and temperature fluctuations [\citep=marsch1990b], as well as for the Elsässer variables [\citep=marsch1990a]. It is most typical of high-speed streams below 1 AU, in these cases the frequency range is more extended and the change of slope occurs at [formula]. Here we cannot exclude that such evident flattening in the velocity spectra be partially due to the level of noise in the data. The instrumental uncertainty on the velocity components is about ±  2 km/s. Modeling this as a uniform noise of amplitude ±  2 km/s, we observe from the synthetic reference that this could influence the last spectral decade (see figure [\ref=fig:generale]). The magnetic field components present a very different phenomenology with respect to the plasma velocity: for each component the spectra have higher exponents in the high frequency range ([formula]) and they tend to become flatter at low frequencies, as shown in figure [\ref=fig:component] (c-d) and in tables [\ref=tab:data_exponent] (b-c); moreover, an anisotropic behavior is also observed both at high and low frequencies: in particular, the radial component is always lower than the tangential one. The normal component, instead, has a spectral index analogous to the radial one a low frequencies (for [formula], considering Alfvén units, αbR  ≈   - 1.24 and αbN  ≈   - 1.11, when αbT  ≈   - 1.49), while it becomes similar to the tangential exponent at high frequencies (for [formula], considering Alfvén units, αbT  ≈   - 1.67 and αbN  ≈   - 1.70, when αbT  ≈   - 1.48).

The spectral exponent for the magnetic energy is αEm  ≈   - 1.65 at high frequencies, as predicted by the Kolmogorov law. At low frequencies the exponents drop to values around [formula], thus the energy cascade is very damped in this frequency range. Though the magnetic field fluctuations in the inertial range often follow a Kolmogorov -5/3 behavior [\cite=podesta2007], spectral indices around 1.8 have been recently observed at about 1 AU by other authors as [\cite=safrankova2013]. Spectra presented here are in good agreement with those found by [\cite=matthaeus1992a] (magnetic spectral index of -1.7 at high frequencies for Voyager 1 data at about 5 AU) and [\cite=klein] (magnetic spectral index of -1.17 at low frequencies and -1.88 at high frequencies for Voyager 1 data at 4 AU), where an analysis for V1 spectra of magnetic modules respectively at 5 and 10 AU can be found for a frequency range from [formula].

The different behavior of the power spectra of kinetic and magnetic energies can be appreciated by considering the Alfvèn ratio, defined as

[formula]

and represented in Figure [\ref=fig:alf_ratio].

The Alfvén ratio is usually less than unity in the inertial range [\cite=tu1995] [\cite=matthaeus1982b]. The change occurs when r̂A reaches its minimum values. Moreover, the minimum value is lower than 0.5, as observed for slow solar wind inside 1 AU [\citep=orlando1997]. In general, leaving aside the frequency of the minimum which depends on the distance from the Sun, similar evolution of r̂A with frequency can be observed [\cite=marsch1990a]. For completeness, in Figure [\ref=fig:den-temp-spectra], spectra of the density and thermal speed are reported. The behavior is similar for the integral scale and inertial decay in the central part. A light steepening of the inertial decay is observed for the thermal speed analogous to that of the plasma normal component.

Conclusions

In this work we computed the power spectra of the solar slow wind, density, thermal speed and magnetic field at 5 AU at low latitude from Voyager 2 measurements. By using data reconstruction techniques to overcome the missing data issues, we have been able to determine the spectra for a frequency range extending over five decades (10- 7 - 10- 2 Hz). This extended range, much wider than in any other previous study at this distance, allows us to observe the changes in the spectral slopes providing information on the structure of the solar wind. The analysis procedures have been validated by testing three different data recovery methodsr, linear interpolation, two-point correlations, and maximum likelihood recovery and compressed sensing, on synthetic data which mimic the behavior of the well-known homogeneous and isotropic turbulence system, which have been made lacunous by projecting the same gap distribution as in the V2 plasma data. The plasma velocity spectrum presents an inertial range with an exponent close to the Kolmogorov model up to f = 3  ·  10- 4 Hz, while some flattening occurs at higher frequencies. The magnetic spectrum shows a change of spectral index at about f = 5  ·  10- 5 Hz, in agreement with Ulysses data near the ecliptic at 4.8 AU. Above this frequency the slope is [formula] and remains constant in the whole range of observed frequencies. We can therefore conclude that the inertial range extends at least from [formula] to f = 5  ·  10- 3 Hz. Given the direction of the mean magnetic field, these spectra can be seen as spatial spectra in the perpendicular direction to the mean magnetic field when the Taylor frozen-flow assumption is used. The variation of the spectral index can be due to the presence of Alfven waves or to anisotropies with relevant effects of the parallel sweeping due to the large scale magnetic fluctuations. In fact, the anisotropy appears to be significant at frequencies below f = 10- 5 Hz, when most of the energy tends to be concentrated into the radial component of the velocity fluctuations and in the tangential component of the magnetic field fluctuations. Moreover, the Alfven ratio, which remains small for most of the frequency range, becomes larger than 0.5 at the lowest frequencies, below f = 10- 5 Hz. At high frequencies there is a marked dominance of magnetic energy with respect to kinetic energy.

For all the gap compensation methods here presented, practical details concerning software issues are described in the Supplementary Information.
