Conic-Helical Orbits of Planets around Binary Stars do not Exist

Introduction

[\cite=Oks] begins by considering planetary orbits around the interstellar axis between two motionless stars. Such systems can be characterized by a two-dimensional parameter space (w,b), where w is the scaled distance of the plane of the orbit along the interstellar axis from one of the stars, and b is the mass ratio of the stars. An effective potential [formula] is derived, associated with a conserved quantity M, the projection of the planet's orbital angular momentum on the interstellar axis, and the regions of the parameter space that allow points of stable equilibrium for [formula] are identified.

Further restrictions on (w,b) are derived which force the frequency of the planetary orbit to be much faster than the Kepler frequency of the binary pair. The problem of the orbit when the binary pair rotates is studied in a non-inertial frame in which the stars remain fixed and the dynamics is modified by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. This analysis proceeds by treating the planet's degrees of freedom in a plane through the interstellar axis as a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, driven by the Coriolis force, around a stable equilibrium point in the [formula] derived under the assumption that the stars are motionless. If the amplitudes of the driven oscillators are small, the full motion of the planet will be a helix lying on the surface of a cone whose axis of symmetry is the interstellar axis.

However, we believe this analysis is not correct, as [formula] depends on M, which is not conserved, even approximately, as the binary pair rotates.

Failure of M to be conserved

In Section 3.2 of [\cite=Oks], the centrifugal and Coriolis forces are obtained by approximating the planetary orbit as circular, with its center on the interstellar axis and its plane orthogonal to that axis. This is not intended as a detailed description of the motion, but since the departures from it are assumed to be small and cyclical, with periods much shorter than the time scale associated with the stellar orbit, their effect should be negligible, especially when averaged over suitable time scales.

Our analysis will extend that in [\cite=Oks], so that rather than assuming that the plane of the orbit remains orthogonal to the axis, we will allow for the possibility that its normal vector makes an angle α(t) with the axis, while remaining in the plane of the stellar orbit. We will also allow for the possibility that the center of the orbit moves along the axis.

We will work in Cartesian coordinates in a rotating frame fixed to the stars, with the origin at the center of mass of the binary pair, the x-axis as the interstellar axis, and the z-axis as the axis of rotation for the stellar orbit. Wlog, we will assume that the planet has unit mass.

M(t), the projection of the planet's angular momentum on the interstellar axis, is given by:

[formula]

If the angular velocity of the stellar orbit is ω, the Coriolis force is:

[formula]

The component of the torque along the x-axis due to the Coriolis force is:

[formula]

The centrifugal force is:

[formula]

The component of the torque along the x-axis due to the centrifugal force is:

[formula]

The gravitational force exerted by either star, the displacement of the planet from the center of mass, and the interstellar axis all lie in the same plane, so the torque due to the gravitational force is always orthogonal to the interstellar axis, and has no effect on M(t).

We approximate the motion of the planet with a circular orbit of angular velocity f and radius ρ, centred on the point (x1(t),0,0), and tilted at an angle α(t).

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=E:xyz]) into ([\ref=E:M]), ([\ref=E:T1]) and ([\ref=E:T2]) we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Differentiating ([\ref=E:MC]), we obtain:

[formula]

The rate of change of the planet's angular momentum must be equal to the total torque it experiences, so for the components projected on the interstellar axis we have:

[formula]

If we substitute ([\ref=E:T1C]), ([\ref=E:T2C]) and ([\ref=E:MCD]) into ([\ref=E:MTT]), and require the terms with factors of sin (2ft), cos (2ft) and sin (ft) to be equal to zero, we obtain the differential equations:

[formula]

The second of these equations is satisfied by either α(t) = nπ for some integer n, or α(t)  =  ωt  +  α0, but the first equation is satisfied only by the latter choice. So the only solution to the full system of equations is:

[formula]

If we substitute this solution into ([\ref=E:T1C]), ([\ref=E:T2C]) and ([\ref=E:MCD]), then equation ([\ref=E:MTT]) is satisfied, because the only remaining terms that we did not use to construct ([\ref=E:DIFF]) are a multiple of the left-hand side of the second equation in ([\ref=E:DIFF]).

Substituting this solution into ([\ref=E:MC]), we obtain:

[formula]

Clearly M(t) is not conserved on the time scale of the stellar orbit. The regime of interest in [\cite=Oks] is f  ≫  ω, so the first term here will dominate, and M(t) will be approximately sinusoidal, with a period equal to that of the stellar orbit.

This result shows that the treatment of the orbits in Section 3.2 of [\cite=Oks], which relies on M(t) being at least approximately conserved in order that the same effective potential can be used throughout the stellar orbit, is not correct. It also shows that a planetary orbit that initially lies on a cone whose axis of symmetry coincides with the interstellar axis will retain an approximately constant orientation in an inertial frame, rather than the frame rotating with the stars, destroying the alignment with the interstellar axis on any time scale comparable to the period of the stellar orbit.

The long-term dynamics of planetary orbits at large inclinations to the plane of the stellar orbit has been examined in prior literature, such as [\cite=Innanen].
