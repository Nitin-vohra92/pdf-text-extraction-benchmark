Probing Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium Associated with the Virgo Cluster using an Oxygen Absorption Line

Introduction

From several independent measurements -- cosmic microwave background anisotropy analysis [\citep=Spergel03], primordial deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio [\citep=Burles01], and Lyα forest absorption at high redshift (z  ~  3) [\citep=Rauch97] -- the cosmic baryon density is now converging to Ωb  ≈  0.04h- 270, where h70  =  H0 / 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1 and H0 is the Hubble constant. The local baryon density appears, however, to be far lower than these indications (e.g., [\cite=Fukugita98]; [\cite=Bristow94]; [\cite=Persic92]). Recent large-scale galaxy formation simulations predict that most of the baryons (~  50%) at the present time reside in a warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) with temperatures of 105-107 K, and form filamentary structures associated with clusters and groups of galaxies (e.g., [\cite=Cen99]). This warm-hot gas is heated primarily by shock heating of gas accreting onto the large-scale structure [\citep=Dave01], and its fraction is increasing with time. Therefore, detecting those warm-hot baryons is very important, not only for settling the 'missing baryon' problem, but also for understanding the formation of large-scale cosmological structure.

Considering the elemental abundance and the ionization fraction, O and O absorption lines are the best tracers for probing the warm-hot gas at 106-107 K ([\cite=Perna98]; [\cite=Fang00]). In fact, these lines have been detected with grating spectrometers onboard Chandra and XMM-Newton, toward PKS 2155-304, 3C 273, Mrk 421, and 3C 120 ([\cite=Nicastro02]; [\cite=Fang02]; [\cite=Rasmussen03]; [\cite=Fang03]; [\cite=McKernan03]). In most cases, the center energy is consistent with a zero redshift, which suggests detection of the WHIM in the local group. However, if its redshift is zero, distinguishing it from the warm-hot interstellar matter in our Galaxy is not trivial [\citep=Futamoto04]. On the other hand, soft X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies has been studied (e.g., [\cite=Kaastra03]; [\cite=Finoguenov03]). These authors claimed the detection of a warm-hot component with kT  ~  0.2 keV. However, since the energy band below 0.5 keV is significantly contaminated by emission from the Milky Way halo and the Local Hot Bubble, a precise determination of the quantities of the warm-hot gas is very difficult with the limited energy resolution of proportional counters and X-ray CCDs.

In searching for a breakthrough, we decided to probe the warm-hot gas associated with nearby clusters of galaxies through absorption lines by observing a quasar behind the Virgo cluster with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS; [\cite=Herder01]) onboard XMM-Newton [\citep=Jansen01]. In this paper, we report on our observation and results. We assume h70 = 1 throughout this paper. Errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level, unless otherwise stated.

Sample Selection and Observation

To find an appropriate target, we searched the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) bright source catalogue [\citep=Voges99] and the source catalogue from pointed PSPC observations for bright quasars behind the Virgo and Coma clusters. The target that we selected was LBQS 1228+1116. The location of this quasar is (, ), which is (or 0.45 Mpc in linear scale) south of M87 (figure [\ref=fig:ROSAT_image]). Because the redshift is z  =  0.237 [\citep=Hewett95], it is located well behind the Virgo cluster. The ROSAT PSPC count rate was 0.12-0.15 cps.

The observation was performed with XMM-Newton, from 2003 July 13 to July 14. The observation ID is 0145800101. The instrument mode, filter, and the net exposure time are summarized in table [\ref=tab:obslog]. Note that, although 100 ks was scheduled, the net observation time was only ~  50 ks due to background flares.

Data Analysis and Results

Absorption Line

The observation data file (ODF) was divided into two files. We performed data reduction using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS), version 5.4.1, with standard parameters. For the RGS, we checked the data from a source-free region of CCD 9 for background flares, and accumulated the signal photons only when the count rates in this region were less than 0.15 cps for both RGS1 and 2. The net exposure time was 8.8 ks for the first file and 45.0 ks for the second. The background spectra were produced using the same data sets. All of the spectra were binned in four-channel bins (0.042 Å), and the first and second halves were summed.

There was no sign of an O absorption line at around 21.6 Å, where only the RGS1 operates. The 99.7% upper limit of the equivalent width was 2.8 eV at 21.69 Å (571.6 eV). Therefore, we concentrated on the O region. Figure [\ref=fig:RGS_spec] shows the spectra obtained with the RGS1 and 2, between 18 Å and 20 Å. There is an absorption-line feature at around 19.1 Å in both RGS1 and 2. We fitted the spectra with a power law and a negative Gaussian, multiplied by the Galactic absorption (NH  =  2.15  ×  1020 cm- 2), using XSPEC version 11.2. Since the number of photons, especially near the absorption line, is small, we used the C-statistic (maximum-likelihood) method. When this method is used, a background spectrum cannot be subtracted from the data. Therefore we estimated the background level by fitting the background spectra of RGS1 and 2 simultaneously with a constant model, and included it in the fitting model. The results are summarized in table [\ref=tab:RGS_param]; the best-fit model is shown in figure [\ref=fig:RGS_spec]. The line shape was consistent with a narrow line, with a 90% upper limit on a width of σ < 5.1 eV. Hence, the line width was fixed at 0.1 eV, which is small compared with the detector resolution (Δλ  ~  0.06-0.07 Å or ΔE  ~  2 eV FWHM). When we calculated the errors of the absorption-line parameters, we also fixed the photon index of the power-law component. The observed line center energy and equivalent width were 650.9+ 0.8- 1.9 eV and 2.8+ 1.3- 2.0 eV, respectively. If we assume that this is an O absorption line, the energy shift from the rest frame is 2.7+ 0.8- 1.9 eV, which corresponds to cz = 1253+ 881- 369 km s- 1. This is consistent with that of M87 (cz = 1307 km s- 1). Note that the systematic error in the absolute energy scale of the RGS is 8 mÅ (rms) or 0.3 eV at 650 eV [\citep=Herder01], which is much smaller than the statistical errors.

We evaluated the statistical significance of the absorption line in the following way. The best-fit model without an absorption line gives a C-statistic of 181.76. When we include an absorption line, but fix the center and the width to the energy of the O Kα resonant line with cz = 1307 km s- 1 and σ = 0.1 eV, respectively, we obtain the best-fit C-statistic of 177.43. Thus, the improvement, ΔC, is 4.33. The value of ΔC approximately follows the χ2 statistic for 1 degree of freedom if the absorption line is just a statistical fluctuation [\citep=Cash79]. In order to evaluate the statistical confidence of the line detection, we produced 10000 simulation spectra using the continuum model shown in table [\ref=tab:RGS_param] and the background without the absorption line. We then fitted the spectra with and without a Gaussian absorption or emission line model. We obtained ΔC  ≥  4.33 for 3.6% of the simulation spectra. This is consistent with the value expected from the χ2 distribution (3.7%). We thus conclude that the chance probability for detecting such an absorption line at the very wavelength corresponding to O Kα at the cluster redshift is 3.6%; in other words, the statistical confidence of the absorption line is 96.4%.

The width of the wavelength range where both the RGS1 and 2 operate is ~  15.6 Å. Because the wavelength resolution is ~  0.06 Å, there are about 260 independent wavelength bins. The probability for detecting an emission/absorption structure of ΔC  ≥  4.33 at some wavelength is almost unity with an expected occurrence of 9.4. We searched for such structures in the observed spectra, and actually found seven such structures other than that at 19.05 Å. However, none of them can be identified with any atomic emission/absorption line with a reasonable oscillator strength at z = 0, the cluster redshift, or the quasar redshift. Thus, these are all considered to be statistical fluctuations, and only the 19.05 Å feature can be real at a statistical confidence of 96.4%.

We then investigated the systematic errors. First, we checked the RGS spectra of bright X-ray sources in the archival data to ensure that there is no instrumental feature at that wavelength. Then, since the estimation of an absorption line could be influenced by the determination of the continuum, we examined the dependence of the equivalent width on the wavelength region used in the fits and the choice of the continuum model. For this purpose, we changed the width of the wavelength band for fits from 1.0 to 2.8 Å and added a fifth-order polynomial to the continuum. We found that, as long as the width of the fitting region is wider than 1.6 Å, the variation of the equivalent width is smaller than 0.2 eV. When the fitting region is too narrow, the continuum level is not well constrained, and is strongly coupled to the equivalent width of the line.

Assuming that the absorption line is not saturated, the equivalent width is related to the ion column density in the following way:

[formula]

where Nion is the column density of the ion and fos is the oscillator strength of the transition [\citep=Sarazin89]. We used fos = 0.70 for the O resonance absorption line and fos = 0.42 for that of O [\citep=Verner96]. Then, the O column density was (6.2+ 3.3- 4.4)  ×  1016 cm- 2, while the 99.7% upper limit on the O column density was 3.7  ×  1016 cm- 2.

Excess Emission

We also analyzed the EPIC data, and searched for diffuse emission. Since we are mostly interested in the low-energy band, the pn detector is suitable for our analysis. Hence, we describe the results obtained from the pn data here. We confirmed that the MOS data gave similar results, but with larger errors.

The number of events above 10 keV is regarded as a good indicator of the internal background. Thus, we discarded the data where the rate of pattern 0 events in this energy range was larger than 0.7 cps. Then, we excluded LBQS 1218+1116 and other point sources using SAS edetect_chain, and accumulated photons from the diffuse emission in the 0.3-3 keV band over the field of view. To remove any contribution from the internal background, we subtracted data taken with the filter wheel in the closed position from the spectrum. We then modeled it with four components: hot intracluster medium (ICM) of the Virgo cluster, cosmic X-ray background (CXB), Milky Way halo (MWH), and Local Hot Bubble (LHB). For the CXB, MWH, and LHB, we used parameters obtained by [\citet=Lumb02] as a template. When we fixed the temperature of the MWH (0.20 keV), the temperature of the LHB (0.07 keV), and all of the CXB parameters, the temperature of the ICM determined by the fit became 2.0+ 0.2- 0.1 keV, which is consistent with that obtained with ASCA (2.14  ±  0.12 keV, [\cite=Shibata01]). The normalization of the MWH was, however, a factor of 2.3-times larger than that obtained by [\citet=Lumb02]. From an analysis of eight data sets obtained with XMM-Newton, [\citet=Lumb02] indicated that the mean deviation of 0.2-1 keV flux is about 35% from field to field. Therefore, the level of the warm-hot emission around LBQS 1228+1116 is significantly higher than that of the typical Galactic background, even if we consider its fluctuation. We fixed the parameters of the MWH, LHB, and CXB to those obtained by [\citet=Lumb02], added another optically-thin thermal plasma component, and fitted the entire spectrum. Note that the normalization of the additional component (N) strongly couples with the oxygen abundance (A), and A  ×  N is a good parameter. Here, we assumed A = 0.1. The results are summarized in table [\ref=tab:EPICpn], and the best-fit models are shown in figure [\ref=fig:EPIC_spec]. Note that the errors given in table [\ref=tab:EPICpn] do not contain the uncertainties of the background components. The normalization of the excess emission depends on the normalization, abundance, and temperatures of the MWH and LHB, while the temperature of the excess emission is sensitive to those of the MWH and LHB.

It is known that the Virgo cluster is located close to the North Polar Spur (Loop I) (e.g., [\cite=Irwin96]). To evaluate its effect, we inspected the RASS 3/4 keV map of the diffuse X-ray background [\citep=Snowden97]. The upper panel of figure [\ref=fig:RASS] shows a [formula] image centered at LBQS 1228+1116. The lower panel is a projection of the [formula] region shown in the upper panel. The levels of the background components (MWH, LHB, CXB) estimated from the data obtained by [\citet=Lumb02] and of the warm-hot emission plus LHB and CXB estimated from the present EPIC pn data are also shown in the panel with a dashed line and a solid line, respectively. The level of the west side of the Virgo cluster ([formula]) is consistent with that of [\citet=Lumb02], while that of the east side ([formula]) is significantly higher and comparable with the level of the warm-hot emission plus LHB and CXB at LBQS 1228+1116.

Discussion

Our results suggest the existence of a red-shifted O resonance absorption line with a statistical confidence of 96.4% due to limited statistics. The velocity shift is 1253+ 881- 369 km s- 1, which is consistent with that of M87 (cz = 1307 km s- 1). Thus, we claim detection of the WHIM associated with the Virgo cluster. The equivalent width of the O Kα line is 2.8+ 1.3- 2.0 eV. This is much larger than those reported for WHIM in the local group (EW = 0.1-0.4 eV; e.g., [\cite=Rasmussen03]; [\cite=Fang02]). The intrinsic width of the line was not resolved, with an upper limit of σ < 5.1 eV (90%). This corresponds to a Doppler b parameter of < 3300 km s- 1. Because the Virgo cluster is thought to be elongated along the line of sight by 12-30 Mpc [\citep=Yasuda97], a velocity difference of 800-2100 km s- 1 is expected due to cosmological expansion. On the other hand, a turbulent velocity of a few hundred km s- 1 is expected for WHIM from simulations (e.g., [\cite=Cen99]). From the curve of growth of the O Kα absorption line (see [\cite=Futamoto04]), the O column density [formula] is estimated to be 6.8  ×  1016, 9.6  ×  1016, and 2.4  ×  1017 cm- 2, respectively, for b = 2100, 800, and 400 km s- 1 with EW = 2.8 eV. [formula] cm- 2 is close to the maximum column density predicted by Fang and Canizares (2000), who investigated the column density of the WHIM gas by Monte-Carlo simulations.

On the other hand, no O absorption line was detected. From the upper limit, the ionization fraction ratio of O to O is constrained to be > 1.7, assuming that both of the O Kα and O Kα lines are not saturated. If we further assume collisional ionization equilibrium, this implies kT > 0.20 keV [\citep=Mazzotta98]. However, photoionization by the cosmic X-ray and UV background radiation would increase the ionization fraction of O if the density is as low as 10- 5 cm- 3 [\citep=Chen03]. Since we can constrain only the upper limit of the density (see next paragraph), this could be the case for the WHIM around the Virgo cluster, and its temperature could be lower.

Excess emission was found in the EPIC spectra over the multi-component model representing the emission from the Virgo ICM, CXB, LHB, and MWH. The intensity of the multi-component model is consistent with the RASS diffuse soft X-ray background map in the north and the west regions just outside of the Virgo cluster. This strongly suggests that the excess emission is associated with the Virgo cluster. However, a possible contribution by emission from the North Polar Spur cannot be excluded completely. We thus take the emission intensity as the upper limit for the emission from the WHIM around the Virgo cluster. The O column density is related to the average electron density, ne, and the line-of-sight length, L, of the WHIM as [formula], where f is the ionization fraction, A is the oxygen abundance relative to the solar value, and [formula] is the solar abundance of the oxygen. On the other hand, if we assume a uniform distribution of the WHIM, the emission measure, EM, of the plasma is EM  ~  n2eLS, where S is the geometrical area that we observed, and is 7.3  ×  103 kpc2 for the present data. Then, the electron density and the line-of-sight distance are constrained to

[formula]

where N is the normalization of the excess emission (see table [\ref=tab:EPICpn]), and 0.4 is the ionization fraction for kT = 0.21 keV. The derived density corresponds to a baryon overdensity of [formula]. The depth of [formula] Mpc is much larger than the linear dimensions of the Virgo cluster in the sky, but is consistent with the elongation of 12-30 Mpc suggested by Yasuda, Fukugita, and Okamura (1997), which is understood as being a filament of the large-scale hierarchical structure along the line of sight. Note that the line broadening due to the Hubble flow of the 9 Mpc line-of-sight distance corresponds to about 1.4 eV. This is much smaller than the 90% upper limit of the line width obtained from the present data. However, it could be resolved if the statistics were good enough, since it is comparable to the energy resolution of the RGS (~  2 eV FWHM).

In summary, the present results strongly suggest the presence of the WHIM in a filament associated with the Virgo cluster at the 96.4% confidence level. To further constrain the physical parameters of the WHIM, a precise determination of the absorption line profile is an important next step. Future high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the emission are also strongly desirable for resolving the Galactic and extragalactic components.
