Symmetric random walks on certain amalgamated free product groups

Introduction and description of results

Symmetric random walks on groups have been much studied since Kesten's classic paper [\cite=K] on the subject. See, for example, [\cite=W:surv] and [\cite=W:book] and references therein.

Given a group G with a finite, symmetric generating set S, we consider the random walk on the associated Cayley graph of the group which starts at the identity element e and at each step moves to any nearest neighbor with equal probability. Let pn be the probability of return to e on the nth step. The Green function of the random walk is

[formula]

and the spectral radius of the random walk is the reciprocal of the radius of convergence of this power seris, i.e.

[formula]

We will consider groups of the form [formula] or [formula], which are amalgamated free products of copies of the integers over a subgroup [formula], where H is embedded in the jth copy of [formula] as the subgroup of index mj. We will denote this group by [formula]. Our generating sets will be [formula], where aj is a generator of the jth copy of [formula]. For convenience, we will call the corresponding random walk the standard random walk on the group [formula]. When mj = 2 for all j, we will write the Green function of the random walk in terms of Legendre's complete elliptic integrals. In other cases, the Green function is equal to the integral of an algebraic function, and arbitarily many terms of its power series expansion can be easily found.

It is known that the spectral radius of the standard random walk on [formula] is an algebraic number. Indeed, H is a normal (in fact, central) subgroup of G that is amenable. By [\cite=K] and [\cite=K:amen], the spectral radius of the standard random walk on G equals the spectral radius of the resulting random walk on the quotient group G / H. But

[formula]

with the generating set [formula] mapping to a union of generating sets for the cyclic groups Z / mjZ. The algebraicity of the spectral radius of this random walk is well known and has been proved by different authors; see [\cite=W:fp], [\cite=CS], [\cite=AK]. See [\cite=CS] and [\cite=PW] for some results about random walks on other amalgamated free product groups.

Our techniques rely on Voiculescu's operator-valued free probability theory, and in particular on the operator-valued R-transform; this is reviewed below, but see [\cite=V], [\cite=VDN] or [\cite=Sp] for more.

The paper is organized as follows. In §[\ref=sec:prelims] we review the elements of operator-valued free probability theory that we will need, principally Voiculescu's R-transform. In §[\ref=sec:Green] we will show that the B-valued Cauchy transform of the standard random walk on [formula] is an algebraic function, where B = C*r(H) is the reduced group C*-algebra of the group over which we amalgamate. We will also find the Green function when [formula].

Preliminaries

Let A be a unital C*-algebra and let B be a unital C*-subalgebra of A having a conditional expectation E:A  →  B. The pair (A,E) forms what is called a B-valued noncommutative probability space. Given T∈A, the B-valued Cauchy transform of T is the function

[formula]

from a neighborhood of 0 in B into B.

We now review the means, devised by Voiculescu [\cite=V], of finding the B-valued R-transform R(B)T of T from the B-valued Cauchy transform. The function C(B)T has an inverse K(B)T = (C(B)T)〈 - 1〉 with respect to composition. Moreover, (see [\cite=Aa]), K(B)T maps some neighborhood of 0 in B bijectively onto a neighborhood of 0 in B and maps invertible elements in this neighborhood to invertible elements. Then the R-transform of T is

[formula]

This is defined for b invertible and of small norm. However, given that C(B)T is a power-series like sum of multilinear maps, both K(B)T and R(B)T are seen to have a similar structure; see also the combinitorial description in [\cite=Sp]. The above definition of R(B)T on invertible elements actually determines it on all of a neighborhood of 0 in B.

Suppose for every i in an index set I, Ai  ⊆  A is a C*-subalgebra of A with B  ⊆  Ai. The family (Ai)i∈I is said to be free if [formula] whenever [formula] and [formula]. A family (Ti)i∈I of elements of A is said to be free if the family [formula] of C*-subalgebras is free.

In a B-valued noncommutative probability space (A,E), suppose Ti∈A are such that (Ti)Ni = 1 is a free family. Then

[formula]

We will now consider how these results from free proability theory may be applied to the study of random walks on amalgamated free products of groups. Given a group G, let λ  =  λ(G) be the left regular representation of G as unitary operators on [formula], extended linearly to a *  -representation of the complex group algebra [formula]. The reduced group C*-algebra is

[formula]

(We will sometimes write λg instead of λ(g).) Note that the canonical trace on [formula], which extracts the coefficient of the identity element, extends to the tracial state τ  =  τG on C*r(G) given by τ(x) = 〈xδe,δe〉. Thus, (C*r(G),τ) is a [formula]-valued noncommutative probability space. If H is a subgroup of G, then [formula] is isomorphic to C*r(H), and will be denoted as such. The projection [formula] impliments the canonical conditional expecation E:C*r(G)  →  C*r(H), which satisfies

[formula]

Thus, (C*r(G),E) is a C*r(H)-valued noncommutative probability space. Note that E is τ-preserving.

Suppose G = ( * H)Ni = 1Gi is a free product of groups Gi with amalgamation over subgroups H  ⊆  Gi. For ease of writing, we will take N = 2 and write G = G1  *  HG2, though similar considerations apply for general N <   ∞  . The group inclusions Gi  ⊆  G give rise to C*-subalgebras C*r(Gi)  ⊆  C*r(G), and the pair (C*r(G1),C*r(G2)) is free with respect to the canonical conditional expectation E:C*r(G)  →  C*r(H). Suppose Si is a finite, symmetric generating set for Gi. Then [formula] a finite, symmetric generating set for G. Let [formula] and let T = T1 + T2. The adjacency operator T is related to the random walk associated to S by τ(Tn) = |S|npn and the [formula]-valued Cauchy transform

[formula]

is related to the Green function G of this random walk [\eqref=eq:Green] by

[formula]

Let B = C*r(H), We have that [formula] is [formula] restricted to scalar multiples of the identity operator.

What follows, then, is a strategy for finding the Green function of this random walk on G1  *  HG2. If the B-valued Cauchy transforms C(B)T1 and C(B)T2 are known, then the B-valued R-transforms of T1 and T2 can be found and used, with Voiculescu's Theorem [\ref=thm:Rtrans] to compute the B-valued R-transform of T, from with the B-valued Cauchy transform of T can be found. Composing with τ then yields the [formula]-valued Cauchy transform of T.

Green functions

In this section, we consider standard random walks on the amalgamated free product groups [formula]. We find the Green function [formula] of this random walk when mj = 2 for all j, and we show how to derive information about the Green function in other cases.

Let [formula] and consider the subgroup [formula]. Let E be the canonical conditional expectation from A = C*r(G) onto the subalgebra B = C*r(H). Consider the adjacency operator T = λ1  +  λ- 1∈A. Then the B-valued Cauchy transform of T is

[formula]

where p and q are polynomials with integer coefficients, each with constant term equal to 1 and with deg (p)  ≤  n - 1 and deg (q)  ≤  n.

Using the Fourier transform, [formula] is seen to be isomorphic to [formula], the algebra of all continuous functions on the circle, and we henceforth make this identification of A with [formula]. Thus λk∈A is identified with the function that is the map [formula]. The subalgebra [formula], is identified with the set of functions invariant under rotation of the domain [formula] by angle 2π / n, and for every f∈A,

[formula]

where ω  =  ωn  =   exp (2πi / n). For b∈B of sufficiently small norm,

[formula]

Consider the ring

[formula]

which is the group ring of [formula] with coefficients from [formula]. Consider the denominator Q of [\eqref=eq:GnNumDen] as a polynomial in variable b with coefficients from R. Then Q is of degree ≤  n and has constant term equal to 1. The coefficient of bk, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n, is of the form

[formula]

with all [formula]. We see from [\eqref=eq:GnNumDen] that Q is invariant under the automorphism of R given by λj  ↦  ωjλj, ([formula]). So only a0 can be nonzero in [\eqref=eq:bkcoeff] if 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1, while with k = n, we find that the coefficient of bn in Q is of the form

[formula]

But since the coefficient of bn equals

[formula]

we see

[formula]

and a- n = a- 1n =  - 1. Finally, Q is invariant under the transformation ω  ↦  ωd whenever d is relatively prime to n. So by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, we get [formula] in [\eqref=eq:bncoeff] and the coefficient of bk is an integer for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. Let q be the polynomial given by Q(b) = q(b) - bn(λ- n  +  λn).

By the same reasoning as for Q, we see that the numerator, P, of [\eqref=eq:GnNumDen] is equal to [formula], where [formula] is a polynomial of degree ≤  n - 1 having integer coefficients, and where the constant coefficient of [formula] is equal to n. We need only show that the coefficients of [formula] are all integers. Equating two descriptions of C(B)T(b), we get

[formula]

where [formula]. Since E(b(Tb)k) can be written as a linear combination of [formula] with coefficients from [formula] and since [formula] has integer coefficients and zero constant coefficient, we conclude that [formula] has integer coefficients.

Let Cn denote the B-valued Cauchy transform considered in equation [\eqref=eq:ZGr] of Proposition [\ref=prop:ZGr]. Using the formula [\eqref=eq:GnNumDen], we find

From Proposition [\ref=prop:ZGr] and the procedure for obtaining the R-transform as described in §[\ref=sec:prelims], we see that the C*r(H)-valued R-transform of the operator T considered above is an algebraic function. A precise formulation is below.

Let [formula], let [formula], E:A  →  B and T be as in Proposition [\ref=prop:ZGr]. Let R = R(B)T be the B-valued R-transform of T. Then there is an irreducible polynomial Qn in three variables and with integer coefficients such that

[formula]

where ξ  =  λ- p  +  λp, for p a generator of H.

Below are listed some of the irreducible polynomials Qn = Qn(R,b,ξ) from Proposition [\ref=prop:ZR].

[formula]

Let [formula] with generating set [formula] be as described in the introduction. Let B = C*r(H)  ⊆  C*r(G) = A equipped with the canonical conditional expectation E:A  →  B. Let [formula] be the adjacency operator for the standard random walk. Let C = C(B)T and R = R(B)T be the B-valued Cauchy transform and R-transform of T, respectively. Then there is are irreducible polynomials [formula] and [formula], each in three variables and with integer coefficients, such that

[formula]

where ξ  =  λ- p  +  λp, for p a generator of H.

We have [formula] where aj is a generator of the jth copy of [formula] in the amalgamated free product [formula], and [formula], where Tj  =  λa- 1j  +  λaj. By additivity of the B-valued R-transform (Theorem [\ref=thm:Rtrans]),

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=prop:ZR], each R(B)Tj(b) is an algebraic function of b and ξ, being the root of the polynomial with integer coefficients, so the same is true for R(B)T. Now the procedure for finding C(B)T from R(B)T yields the polynomial [formula] from [formula].

The polynomials [formula] and [formula] are easily found, as is illustrated in the following three examples. In the first two of these examples, we are able to write explicitly the Green functions of the random walks.

Consider the case G = G2,2. Note that G is an amenable group. Then from Q2 of Examples [\ref=exs:Rn], we get immediately

[formula]

and

[formula]

Letting C(B)2,2 denote the B-valued Cauchy transform of the adjacency operator T, namely the quantity C in [\eqref=eq:G22] above, and using the asymptotic behavior [formula] as [formula] to choose the branch of the square root, we get

[formula]

Letting C2,2 denote the scalar-valued Cauchy transform of T, we have for [formula],

[formula]

where τ is the canonical trace on C*r(H). Thus, taking |ζ| small,

[formula]

where

[formula]

with the indicated asymptotics as [formula] and where in [\eqref=eq:G22int], the branch of [formula] close to 1 / 2ζ is chosen. Replacing the contour |z| = 1 by the contour drawn in Figure [\ref=fig:contour], and letting the circles shrink to the point of disappearing, we get

[formula]

where we have made the change of variables t =  sin 2φ, where F1 is Legendre's complete elliptic integral of the first kind (see [\cite=Cayley]) and where we take the branch of [formula] that is close to 1 / (2ζ); it is not necessary to specify the branch of [formula]. Therefore, the Green function of the standard random walk on on G2,2 is

[formula]

Let [formula] be the free product of [formula] copies of the integers with amalgamation over their index-two subgroups. As in the previous example and using analogous notation, we find

[formula]

Solving for C gives

[formula]

and integrating yields the [formula]-valued Cauchy transform

[formula]

for ζ sufficiently small. The denominator in the integrals [\eqref=eq:G2n2_1stint] and [\eqref=eq:G2n2_2ndint] has roots

[formula]

The value of the first term [\eqref=eq:G2n2_1stint] is, thus,

[formula]

The second term [\eqref=eq:G2n2_2ndint] equals

[formula]

where

[formula]

The roots of p(z) are

[formula]

and the quantity [\eqref=eq:2ndterm] equals

[formula]

But we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Thus, [\eqref=eq:z3456int] becomes

[formula]

Using the contour in Figure [\ref=fig:contour], but with z5 replacing z1, we see that the term [\eqref=eq:z56int] equals

[formula]

while the term [\eqref=eq:z456int] equals where Π1 is Legendre's complete elliptic integral of the third kind and where in [\eqref=eq:z56intresult] and [\eqref=eq:z456intresult], we take the branch of [formula] that is close to [formula]. We now consider the term [\eqref=eq:z356int]. We see from the asymptotics [\eqref=eq:z3], [\eqref=eq:z5] and [\eqref=eq:z6] that for ζ sufficiently small we have |z5| < |z3| < 1. Hence, picking up the residue at z3, we see that the term [\eqref=eq:z356int] equals

[formula]

where we choose the branch of

[formula]

that is close to [formula] and, again, the branch of [formula] that is close to [formula]. However,

[formula]

and the residue [\eqref=eq:res] equals

[formula]

which exactly cancels [\eqref=eq:2-N]. Collecting all terms, we have

[formula]

which yields for the Green function of the standard random walk on [formula] the expression

[formula]

where

[formula]

Consider the case G = G2,3. Using Maple to find a Groebner basis, one quickly computes Q2,3 from Q2 and Q3. (We checked this result in Mathematica by back-substitution and elimination.) We found that Q2,3 = Q2,3(R,b,ξ) from Proposition [\ref=prop:Z*ZRGr] is

[formula]

From this, we find P2,3 = P2,3(C,b,ξ) from Proposition [\ref=prop:Z*ZRGr] is

[formula]

The B-valued Cauchy transform, C(B)2,3, of the adjacency operator T is an algebraic function of degree 3. To compute explicitly the [formula]-valued Cauchy transform of T by integrating as was performed in Examples [\ref=ex:22] and [\ref=ex:2n2] seems, thus, to be difficult. However, starting from [formula], further terms of the power series expansion for C(B)2,3 can be computed from the polynomial P2,3. We obtain, for instance,

[formula]

Taking τ of [\eqref=eq:C23Bexp] and using

[formula]

we get the expansion for the [formula]-valued Cauchy transform of T, which gives the following expression for the first several terms of the Green function for the standard random walk on G2,3:

[formula]

Here is the case G = G2,4, using notation as in the previous example:

[formula]

Here is the case G = G2,5.
