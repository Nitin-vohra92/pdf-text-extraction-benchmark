Canonical entanglement for two indistinguishable particles

Introduction.- Entanglement and the indistinguishability of particles are two remarkable features of quantum mechanics, yet combining the two in order to obtain a meaningful quantification of entanglement for indistinguishable particles is challenging. Several definitions of correlation and entanglement have been introduced [\cite=Sch01] [\cite=Pas01] [\cite=Li01] [\cite=Zan02] [\cite=Git02] [\cite=Wiseman03] [\cite=Ghi04], which both illustrates the choices that are available in quantifying entanglement and underpins the ambiguities about what constitutes the best measure of entanglement.

If entanglement is to be associated with observational properties that can overcome the indistinguishability of the particles, then the tensor product structure (TPS) [\cite=Zan01] plays a key role. In fact entanglement itself is a consequence of the TPS and the superposition principle. However, for systems consisting of many indistinguishable particles such as bosons and fermions, the TPS is rather subtle. Approaches to quantifying entanglement can be subdivided into two main Categories: one based on the canonical decomposition [\cite=Sch01] [\cite=Pas01] [\cite=Li01] and the other based on the occupation-number representation [\cite=Zan01] [\cite=Zan02]. Here we employ both approaches to determine entanglement for two indistinguishable particles. Our approach is built on two steps: (i) to use the canonical decomposition to obtain the canonical form of the two-particle states and (ii) to define entanglement from the canonical form of the state by the approach based on the occupation-number representation. We refer to this form of entanglement for indistinguishable particles as canonical entanglement. Although large numbers of particles can be considered, the method is given for two particles, which can be used as a primitive to treat multiple particles.

Tensor product structure for states of two indistinguishable particles.- A pure state of two particles can be written as

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] creation operators for modes i and j, respectively, and |0〉 the vacuum state (no particles at all). For the case of fermions, Ω is an antisymmetric matrix and the creation operators are fermionic, while for the case of bosons, Ω is a symmetric matrix and the creation operators are bosonic.

For the case of fermions, we will assume that there is an even number of modes and set [formula]; for the bosonic case the number of modes is not important, and we will assign M = N. The canonical form for the two-particle states can be obtained with the help of the singular value decomposition (SVD) [\cite=Pas01]. For any antisymmetric 2N  ×  2N matrix [formula], there exists a unitary operator [formula] such that [formula], for [formula] block diagonal with blocks

[formula]

and [formula] may be zero [\cite=Sch01]. This decomposition is unique and yields the fermionic state

[formula]

for [formula] new fermionic operators. The form above is the canonical representation [\cite=Everett] [\cite=Grobe] so we refer to the state ([\ref=eq:PsiF]) as being represented in canonical form. The uniqueness of the SVD ensures that the canonical modes themselves are unique.

Now that we have the canonical form of the two-particle fermion state, we can impose the TPS [\cite=Zan01] first by establishing the following operators

[formula]

which obey su(2) commutation relations. As operators with different subscripts k commute with each other, the state is effectively comprised of distinguishable particles. Furthermore, the state can be regarded as an N-qubit system with the [formula] qubit state given by the vacuum state |0〉k and [formula]; the TPS is now evident:

[formula]

Further discussions of relevant mappings from fermions to qubits can be found in Ref. [\cite=Wu].

For two bosons, Ω in Eq. ([\ref=eq:twoparticles]) is a symmetric complex matrix, and [formula] and âi are bosonic creation and annihilation operators. For any symmetric N  ×  N matrix [formula], there exists a unitary operator [formula] such that [formula], with [formula] and [formula] possibly zero for some values of i. Applying this unique decomposition to the bosonic state |ΨB〉 obtained from ([\ref=eq:twoparticles]) yields

[formula]

where

[formula]

are new bosonic canonical operators. The TPS for the two-particle bosonic state is now clear:

[formula]

If we view the two-boson state |2〉 as a one-excitation state |1〉, this state can be regarded as a multiqubit state, and its entanglement is well-defined.

Correlation measures and average entanglement.- Pakauskas and You proposed a correlation measure to quantify the degree of entanglement [\cite=Pas01]. After deriving the above results, they first obtain the single-particle density matrix and then obtain the correlation measure determined by the von Neumann entropy for this reduced state. For both cases of two fermions and of two bosons, the reduced density matrix is given by

[formula]

with M = 2N and [formula] for fermions and M = N and [formula] for bosons.

The von Neumann entropy can be computed from the matrix elements of Eq. ([\ref=eq:rhonumu]) to obtain

[formula]

For an uncorrelated state, the entropy S = 1 for two fermions, but one encounters the curious situation that the entropy is not zero for an uncorrelated state [\cite=Wiseman03]. Our alternative approach, presented below, remedies this problem and establishes a strong relation between the correlation measure of Pakauskas and You and canonical entanglement. In contrast to the fermionic case, S = 0 does hold for an uncorrelated two-boson state; below we establish the relation between the von Neumann entropy and canonical entanglement for two bosons.

Rather than employ the von Neumann entropy for the reduced state of a two-particle system, as explained above, we employ average entanglement to quantify the global entanglement properties; average entanglement has been employed effectively for studies of nonlinear inhomogeneous systems [\cite=Lak03] [\cite=Wan04] [\cite=Li03] [\cite=Sco04]. From Eq. ([\ref=qubits]), the average entanglement between the [formula] Fermionic qubit and the rest. The average enanglement for two fermions is quantified by the von Neumann entropy

[formula]

for

[formula]

Thus, the average von Neumann entropy is given by

[formula]

For a non-entangled state, the entanglement measure EF = 0. Moreover, EF can be used to quantify the entanglement of two fermions. From Eqs. ([\ref=eq:PsiF]) and ([\ref=EF]), we find a relation between EF and SF, namely

[formula]

The above equation shows that the entanglement definition for two fermions is closely related to the correlation measure.

For two bosons, the entanglement between the [formula] qubit and the remaining N - 1 qubits is given by

[formula]

and the average entanglement is

[formula]

For a non-entangled state, EB = SB = 0. We see that our measures of entanglement for two indistinguishable particles are closely related to the correlation measures for both cases of bosons and fermions. To reveal a more direct connection between our entanglement measure and the correlation measure, we next adopt the linear entropy as a entanglement measure, which is simpler to calculate and manipulate than the von Neumann entropy.

Linear entropy for the measure of entanglement.- Various entanglement measures are used for different purposes. Above we employ the entropy of entanglement, which is related to another measure of entanglement, the squared concurrence (also referred to as the tangle) τ [\cite=Conc] [\cite=Jaeger] via the relation

[formula]

For bipartite entanglement of two qubits, the tangle simply relates to another entanglement measure, linear entropy E', via τ = 2E'. Now we use linear entropy to quantify the correlation and entanglement. The linear entropy for a state [formula] is defined as [formula], which is simpler to compute than the von Neumann entropy and can also be a good estimator for the von Neumann entropy [\cite=Ber03]. As we are considering pure states, the choice of different entropies does not change the qualitative properties of entanglement.

From Eq. ([\ref=eq:rhonumu]), the two-fermion quantum correlation quantified by the linear entropy is

[formula]

From Eq. ([\ref=qubits]), the entanglement between the [formula] qubit and the rest is given by

[formula]

Then, the average linear entropy is obtained as

[formula]

We use the average linear entropy to quantify the entanglement of two fermions. From Eqs. ([\ref=eq1]) and ([\ref=eq2]), we obtain

[formula]

Thus, the entanglement measure E'F is proportional to the correlation measure S'F up to an additive constant. This result is important as we can now claim that the correlation of two fermions considered by Pakauskas and You can be viewed as entanglement.

For two bosons, the correlation measure quantified by the linear entropy is

[formula]

From Eq. ([\ref=qubits2]), the average entanglement is given by

[formula]

It is evident that the two measures are connected by the following relation

[formula]

i.e. the entanglement measure E'B is exactly proportional to the correlation measure S'B. In other words, the entanglement and the correlation measures are equivalent up to a multiplicative factor if we adopt the linear entropy to quantify them.

Conclusions.- In conclusion, we have given entanglement measures of two indistinguishable particles, and both cases of bosons and fermions are considered. The approach here combines the advantages of the approach based on the canonical decomposition and another one based on the occupation-number basis. We also exploit the concept of average entanglement, characterizing the global entanglement properties of the system.

We compare the entanglement measure with the correlation measure, and find they are related. Specifically, we find that if we adopt linear entropy to quantify entanglement and correlation, the entanglement measure for two fermions is proportional to the corresponding correlation measure up to a additive constant, and the entanglement measure for two bosons is equivalent to the correlation measure up to a multiplicative constant. The correlation of two fermions considered by Pakauskas and You can be viewed as entanglement, and this relationship, in turn, supports our choices of entanglement measures.

Although we restricted ourselves to the two-particle cases, our approach shed new lights on quantification of entanglement of indistinguishable many-body systems. The TPS is the first premise of quantum entanglement, and thus we have to identify a TPS in indistinguishable systems in order to define entanglement. The various TPSs give rise to different measures of entanglement, which can lead to ambiguities. However, this ambiguity is really an indication of the complexity of entanglement, associated with the variety of purposes for which entanglement is useful.
