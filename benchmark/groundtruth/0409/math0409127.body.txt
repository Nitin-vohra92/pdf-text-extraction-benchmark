A counterexample to a conjecture on linear systems on [formula]

Introduction

Let us take the projective space [formula] and let us consider the linear system of hypersurfaces of degree d having some points of fixed multiplicity. The virtual dimension of such systems is the dimension of the space of degree d polynomials minus the conditions imposed by the multiple points and the expected dimension is the maximum between the virtual one and - 1. The systems whose dimension is bigger than the expected one are called special systems.

There exists a conjecture due to Harbourne [\cite=har] and Hirschowitz [\cite=hi], characterizing special linear systems on [formula], which has been proved in some special cases [\cite=cm] [\cite=cm2] [\cite=mi] [\cite=ev].

Concerning linear systems on [formula], in [\cite=ci] Ciliberto gives a conjecture based on the classification of special linear systems through double points. In this note we describe a linear system on [formula] that we found in a list of special systems generated with the help of Singular and which turns out to be a counterexample to that conjecture.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 1 we fix some notations and state Ciliberto's conjecture, while Section 2 is devoted to the counterexample. In Section 3 we try to explain speciality of some systems by the Riemann-Roch formula, and we conclude the note with an appendix containing some computations.

Preliminaries

We start by fixing some notations.

Let us denote by [formula] the linear system of hypersurfaces of [formula] of degree d, passing through ai points with multiplicity mi, for [formula]. Let IZ be the ideal of the zero dimensional scheme of multiple points. We denote by [formula] the sheaf [formula]. Given the system [formula], its virtual dimension is

[formula]

and the expected dimension is

[formula]

A linear system will be called special if its expected dimension is strictly smaller than the effective one.

Throughout the paper, if no confusion arises, we will use sometimes the same letter to denote a linear system and the general divisor in the system.

We recall the following definition, see [\cite=ci].

The main conjecture stated in [\cite=ci] is the following.

In this note we give a counterexample to points (ii) and (iii) of this conjecture.

Counterexample

Let us consider the linear system of surfaces of degree nine with one point of degree six and eight points of degree four in [formula], i.e. the system [formula]. In this section we are going to study this system, showing in particular that it is special but its general member is not singular along a rational curve. If we denote by [formula] the quadric through the nine simple points, we have the following:

[formula]

If we denote by H1,H2 two generators of Pic(Q), considering the restriction [formula] we get the system of curves in |9H1 + 9H2|, with one point of multiplicity 6 and eight points of multiplicity 4. We denote for short this system by [formula]. Looking the Appendix [\ref=app-1], we can see that [formula] corresponds to the planar system [formula]. This last system can not be ( - 1)-special (see the Appendix [\ref=app-2]) and [formula]. Therefore, by [\cite=mi] we may conclude that it is empty. In particular, also [formula], and hence [formula] must contain Q as a fixed component. By subtracting Q from [formula] we get [formula], which proves our claim.

This means that the free part of [formula] is contained in [formula] which has virtual dimension 4. So [formula] is a special system. In order to show that [formula] gives a counterexample to Conjecture [\ref=cil] we are now going to prove that the general member of [formula] is singular only along the curve C, intersection of Q and [formula], and that C does not contain rational components. We can consider C as the restriction [formula]. This is equal to [formula] on the quadric Q, which corresponds to [formula] on [formula]. This system is not special of dimension 0 and it does not contain rational components (see Appendix [\ref=app-3]).

Clearly the curve C is contained in [formula] (i.e. the singular locus of [formula]). We are going to show that in fact [formula]. First of all, let us denote by [formula] the subsystem of [formula] obtained by imposing one general simple point on the quadric. Since [formula], Q is a fixed component of this system and the residual part is given by [formula]. Now [formula] is the system [formula] which corresponds to the non-special system [formula], of dimension 1. Therefore, imposing two general simple points on Q and restricting we get that the system [formula] is empty, which implies that [formula] has Q as a fixed component. The residual system [formula] is non-special of dimension 1 (because each surface of this system is a cone over a plane cubic through eight fixed points). This implies that the effective dimension of [formula] can not be greater than 3. Therefore it must be 3 since the virtual dimension is 3. By the same argument one shows that the effective dimension of [formula] is 4. Observe that [formula] since [formula]. So [formula] could have only Q as fixed component, but this is not the case since [formula]. The only curves that may belong to [formula] are the genus 2 curve [formula] and the nine lines of [formula] trough the vertex of the cone and each one of the nine base points of the pencil of plane cubics. We can then conclude that the singular locus [formula] consists only of the curve C, since the subsystem [formula] is not singular along the nine fixed lines.

Speciality and Riemann-Roch theorem

Let Z be a zero dimensional scheme of [formula] and IZ be its ideal sheaf. We put [formula] and consider the exact sequence

[formula]

obtained tensoring by [formula] the sequence defining Z and taking cohomology. From this sequence we obtain that [formula] for i = 2,3 since hi(OZ) = 0 for i = 1,2,3. We also obtain that the virtual dimension of [formula], [formula] is equal to h0(L) - h1(L) - 1 and hence to χ(L) - 1. If [formula] is a scheme of fat points, then on the blow-up [formula] along these points we may consider the divisor [formula] and the associated sheaf   =  OX(). Since [formula], the virtual dimension of [formula] is equal to χ() - 1. By Riemann-Roch formula (see [\cite=ha]) for a divisor [formula] on the threefold X,

[formula]

we obtain the following formula for the virtual dimension of [formula]:

[formula]

since χ(OX) = 1. If the linear system [formula] can be written as [formula], where F is the fixed divisor and [formula] is a free part, then on X we have ||  =    +  ||. Therefore the above formula says that

[formula]

Let us suppose that the residual system [formula] is non-special. The system [formula] has the same effective dimension as [formula], while their virtual dimensions differ by v()  +  ( - KX) / 2. Therefore we can conclude that [formula] is special if v()  +  ( - KX) / 2 is smaller than zero.

For instance, let us consider the system [formula]. It is special because its virtual dimension is - 2 while it is not empty since it is equal to 2Q, where Q is the quadric through the nine simple points. In this case F = 2Q and [formula], so v(F) =  - 2 and ( - KX) / 2 = 0.

Let us consider now the example we described in the previous section, i.e. the system [formula]. We have seen that it can be written as [formula], where Q is the quadric through the nine points, while [formula] is the residual free part. The Chow ring A*(X) (where X is the blow-up of [formula] along the nine simple points) is generated by [formula], where H is the pull-back of the hyperplane divisor of [formula] and the Ei's are the exceptional divisors. The second Chow group A2(X) is generated by [formula], where h = H2 is the pull-back of a line, while ei =  - E2i is the class of a line inside Ei, for [formula]. Clearly H  ·  Ei = Ei  ·  Ej = 0 for i  ≠  j. With this notation we can write:

[formula]

Therefore [formula], [formula] and hence Q( - KX) / 2 =  - 1 (while v(Q) = 0), which implies the speciality of [formula].

Appendix

Linear systems on a quadric

In order to study linear systems on a quadric Q it may be helpful to transform them into planar systems by mean of a birational transformation [formula] obtained by blowing up a point and contracting the strict transforms of the two lines through it. Such transformation gives rise to a 1:1 correspondence between linear systems with one multiple point on the quadric and linear systems with two multiple points on [formula]. In fact, let us consider a linear system |aH1 + bH2| - mp (i.e. a system of curves of kind (a,b) through one point p of multiplicity m). Blowing up at p, one obtains the complete system |aπ*H1 + bπ*H2 - mE| which may be written as |(a + b - m)(π*H1  +  π*H2 - E) - (b - m)(π*H1 - E) - (a - m)(π*H2 - E)|. Since the divisors π*Hi - E (i = 1,2) are ( - 1)-curves, they may be contracted giving a linear system on [formula] of degree a + b - m through two points of multiplicity b - m and a - m and hence

[formula]

( - 1)-curves

In order to study the speciality of the systems [formula] and [formula], we need to produce a complete list of all the ( - 1)-curves of [formula] of kind [formula] which may have an intersection less than -1 with some of these systems. Clearly it is enough to consider the system [formula], whose degree and multiplicities are the biggest. From the condition of being contained twice in this system we deduce the following inequalities: d  ≤  6, 0  ≤  m1,m2  ≤  1 and [formula]. Moreover let us see that [formula]. Otherwise the system would contain twice the compound ( - 1)-curve given by the union of all the simple ( - 1)-curves obtained by permuting the points [formula]. In this case the multiplicities of the compound curve at these points would be too big. An explicit calculation shows that the only ( - 1)-curve of the form [formula] satisfying the preceding conditions is [formula], but this has non negative intersection with any of these systems.

[formula] does not contain rational components

Let S be the blow up of [formula] along the ten points and let C be the strict transform of the curve given by [formula]. Suppose that there exists an irreducible rational component C1 of C. Observe that v(C1) = 0 since the system |C1| has dimension 0 and it is non-special by [\cite=mi]. Therefore, from g(C1) = v(C1) = 0, we get that C1 is a ( - 1)-curve.

We are going to see that if this is the case, then C  ·  C1 =  - 1. Let us take the following exact sequence:

[formula]

By the subsection above, h1(OS(C)) = 0. Let us see that also h1(OS(C - C1)) = 0. Otherwise the system |C - C1| would be special and in particular, by [\cite=mi] there would exist a ( - 1)-curve C2 such that C2  ·  (C - C1)  ≤   - 2. Since [formula] is non-special, C  ·  C2  ≥   - 1 and hence C1  ·  C2  ≥  1. This implies that |C1 + C2| has dimension at least 1, which is impossible since C1 + C2 is contained in the fixed locus of [formula]. Since h0(OS(C - C1)) = h0(OS(C)) = 1, the cohomology of the preceding sequence gives [formula], which means that C  ·  C1  =   - 1 as claimed before.

Arguing as in the previous subsection, we get [formula] with d  ≤  9, 0  ≤  m1,m2  ≤  2, 0  ≤  m  ≤  3. An easy computation shows that the only ( - 1)-curve of this form is [formula] and in this case C  ·  C1  =  5.
