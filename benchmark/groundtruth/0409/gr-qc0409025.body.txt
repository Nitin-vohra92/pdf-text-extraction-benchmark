Minkowski electromagnetic analog for Kerr-Newman electrovac solution

Introduction

There has been much current interest in simulating experiments on black holes and related exotic astrophysical phenomena which are currently inaccessible (or inadvisable) by using analog models in condensed matter[\cite=1]. For example, optical analogs of light-trapping black holes can be created, in concept, by a combination of extremely high index of refraction and dielectric fluid flow. One realization has been the extreme subluminal propagation of light through Bose-Einstein condensates[\cite=2].

In this paper we will derive an exact analog in Lorentzian spacetime for the electromagnetic properties of a Kerr-Newman black hole, based on Minkowski's 1908 formulation of relativistic electrodynamics in moving dielectric media[\cite=m].

Kerr-Newman Geometry

Kerr[\cite=ke] first solved Einstein's equations for a spinning black hole of mass M and angular momentum per unit mass a = S / M. Newman[\cite=ne] generalized this result for a black hole carrying electric charge Q. The metric for Kerr-Newman geometry, in the spherical coordinates {t,r,θ,φ} introduced by Boyer and Lindquist[\cite=bl], can be written

[formula]

where

[formula]

The interval can be compactly represented as

[formula]

The Jacobian for the metric (1) is given by

[formula]

Solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for Kerr-Newman geometry gives an electrovac stress-energy tensor with the following nonvanishing elements: Tλμ:

[formula]

Two of these tensor elements are directly related to the energy density and angular momentum density, namely,

[formula]

The asymptotic form of the metric element g03 =  - 2Ma sin 2θ  r- 1  +  O(r- 2) is also consistent with an angular momentum Ma.

When a = 0, the above result reduces to the Reissner-Nordstrø m solution[\cite=rn]. In flat Lorentzian spacetime, obtained by setting a = M = Q = 0, the metric (1) reduces to

[formula]

Minkowski electrodynamics

The fundamental equations of electrodynamics in curved spacetime are the following:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Eqs (8) and (9) are generalizations of Maxwell's equations, while (10) gives the Maxwell stress-energy tensor.

In Minkowski's formulation of relativistic electrodynamics for moving media[\cite=m], Maxwell's equations take the form

[formula]

[formula]

while the stress-energy tensor in a medium is generalized to

[formula]

Eqs (11)-(13) pertain to the flat Lorentzian spacetime of special relativity. The corresponding relations in curved spacetime can evidently be obtained by the formal replacments

[formula]

The covariant field tensor in spherical coordinates is given by

[formula]

while the contravariant auxilliary field tensor is

[formula]

Minkowski's original definitions of the constitutive relations was based on a homogeneous, isotropic medium moving at constant velocity. A number of variants and extensions have been proposed by many authors[\cite=ce]. In this paper we will assume that Minkowski's formulation provides a valid phenomenological representation, even for nonuniform motion of inhomogeneous media.

Assuming the equivalence of the Kerr-Newman tensor (5) to the Minkowski tensor (13), we obtain the simultaneous equations

[formula]

where cylindrical symmetry implies that the φ-components of the electric and magnetic fields vanish. The solution with the simplest functional forms is found to be

[formula]

The [formula] and [formula] fields are consistent with the scalar and vector potentials

[formula]

As r  →    ∞  , the electric field approaches that of a point charge, with higher-order contributions consistent with an oblate spheroidal distribution of approximate radius a. The magnetic field shows the asymptotic behavior of a point dipole of magnitude μ = Qa = QS / M. As noted by Carter[\cite=ca], this is corresponds to a g-factor of 2, just as in Dirac's relativistic quantum theory. Perhaps this g-factor for spin is a classical relativistic effect, not dependent on quantum mechanics[\cite=b].

The total charge density, including both free and induced charges, is given by

[formula]

with a radial distribution function

[formula]

Eqs (20) and (21) show a predominant localization of charge in the vicinity of a ring of radius a in the medial plane θ  =  π / 2. The analogous total current density is

[formula]

Note that the charge goes negative and current reverses where [formula]. It can be rationalized that this is what causes the enhancement of the g-factor. For larger values of r, the charge and current densities are related by

[formula]

This represents a convective current caused by rotation of the charge distribution with angular velocity

[formula]

around the polar axis, such that [formula] This description of the source of the Kerr-Newman metric is in essential agreement with the analysis of Pekeris and Frankowski[\cite=pf].

Constitutive relations and frame dragging

The electric permittivity and magnetic permeability consistent with the fields (18) could be most simply accounted for by an anisotropic index of refraction, differing in the radial and tangential directions, such that

[formula]

More reasonable conceptually, however, is a model based on an isotropic but rotating medium. Minkowski defined ε and μ in a moving medium such that

[formula]

Solving for [formula] and [formula], we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

with angular velocity ω again around the polar axis. Eqs (18) and (27) are consistent with

[formula]

and

[formula]

For r  ≫  a, we find the limiting dependence

[formula]

and

[formula]

or

[formula]

At the opposite limit, as r  →  0,

[formula]

The effective Minkowski medium thus behaves like a vortex around the charged source with maximum angular velocity c / a at the center, falling off asymptotically as ac / 2r2. The vorticity of the rotating medium, [formula], approaches a limiting value twice that of ω, namely Ω  ≈  ac / r2. Remarkably, this limiting vorticity is equal to the angular velocity of the circulating charge distribution given by (24).

One might visualize an electromagnetic frame dragging, analogous to the Lense-Thirring effect for gravitation, at half the angular velocity of the rotating charge distribution. This might somehow be the basis for rationalization of the multiples of 2 occurring in the Dirac g-factor, as well as the Thomas precession.
