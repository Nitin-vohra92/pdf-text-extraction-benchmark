On the formulation of SPDEs leading to local, relativistic QFTs with indefinite metric and nontrivial S-matrix

Introduction

Local and relativistic quantum fields can be obtained via analytic continuation from Euclidean random fields. From the 80-ies on, this concept, which proved to be useful especially for scalar fields in the space-time dimension d = 2, was applied in a number of articles (see e.g. [\cite=AIK] and references therein) to random vector fields obtained as solutions of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) DA = η, where D is a complex, quaternionic or octonionic Cauchy-Riemann differential operator and η a non Gaussian noise with values in the fields of complex numbers, quaternions or octonions, respectively. For the quaternionic case (space-time dimension d = 4) we have recently been able to prove that the associated quantum gauge fields have non-trivial scattering behaviour [\cite=AGW3].

In the paper [\cite=BGL], the equation DA = η was studied systematically in d dimensional space-time and spin dimension L (of η). Let τ:SO(d)  →  Gl(L) be a representation s.t. η transforms covariantly under the representation of the Euclidean group induced by τ, i.e. τ(Λ)η(Λ- 1(x - y)) = η(x) in probability law [formula] and [formula]. Let D be a differential operator covariant w.r.t. the representation τ, i.e. [formula]. Furthermore we assume that D is translation invariant, i.e. has constant coefficients. In this case, for the Fourier transformed Green's function - 1(k) of D the following representation was obtained in [\cite=BGL]:

[formula]

with [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. QE(k) is an L  ×  L-matrix with polynomial entries of order [formula] which fulfills the Euclidean transformation law [formula]. Without loss of generality we assume that QE is prime w.r.t the factors (|k|2 - m2l), i.e. that none of them divides all of the polynomial matrix elements of QE. If one imposes a "positive mass spectrum" condition ml > 0 for [formula] it follows immediately that D is invertible on the space of ([formula]-valued) distributions over [formula] and we can therefore solve the above SPDE by setting [formula].

The Schwinger functions (moments) associated to A can be calculated exlicitly as

[formula]

where P(n) is the collection of all partitions of [formula] into disjoint subsets and [formula] are constants depending on the law of η. We have also used the Einstein convention of summation on repeated upper and lower greek indices w.r.t. an arbitrary invariant metric on the spin-space.

In this paper we study the analytic continuation of the truncated Schwinger functions STn to truncated relativistic Wightman functions WTn and the scattering behaviour of these Wightman functions. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we explicitly compute the Fourier transformed truncated Wightman functions of the model. This will be done combining techniques of [\cite=AGW1] and [\cite=BGL]. In Section 3 we discuss the scattering behaviour of the truncated Wightman functions, showing that it is nontrivial, if and only if νl = 1 for [formula]. In this case we derive explicit formulae for the truncated scattering amplitudes.

Analytic continuaton of the Schwinger functions

In this section we obtain a representation of the truncated Schwinger functions STn as Fourier-Laplace transforms, i.e.

[formula]

where [formula] is a tempered distribution which fulfils the spectral property, i.e. it has support in the cone [formula], and [formula]. Here, -0 stands for the closed backward lightcone (that we do not use the forward lightcone for the formulation of the spectral condition is a matter of convention on the Fourier transform). Under this condition the above integral exists in the sense of tempered distributions. If such a representation exists, it follows from the general theory of quantum fields that STn is the analytic continuation of the inverse Fourier transform WTn  =  F- 1(ŴTn) of ŴTn from points with purely relativistically real time to the Euclidean points of purely imaginary time. Furthermore, it follows from the symmetry and Euclidean covariance of the STn that WTn fulfills the requirements of Poincaré covariance and locality, see e.g. [\cite=OS].

In order to obtain such a representation, we apply the formula for the expansion of an inverse polynomial into partial fractions on the inverse of the denominator of Eq. ([\ref=1eqa])

[formula]

with [formula] uniquely determined and [formula]. Thus, D- 1(x) can be represented as [formula] and

[formula]

with [formula] and

[formula]

In order to obtain a Laplace representation as in Eq. ([\ref=3eqa]) for [formula] we introduce some notations. Let δ(j)  ±  (k)m: = θ(  ±  k0 > 0)δ(j)(k2 - m2) where δ(j) is the j-th derivative of the one-dimensional delta distribution, θ is the Heaviside function and [formula]. Furthermore, let

[formula]

We are now in the position to state the main theorem of this section:

(i) For n  ≥  3 or [formula] let [formula] be defined as

[formula]

and for n = 2,ml1 = ml2:

[formula]

Then [formula] is a tempered distribution on [formula] which fulfills the spectral property and

[formula]

(ii) Let [formula] be defined as

[formula]

then [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] fulfills the requirements of temperedness, relativistic covariance w.r.t. the representation [formula], locality, spectral property and cluster property. Here [formula] is obtained by analytic continuation of τ to a representation of the proper complex Lorentz group over [formula] (which contains SO(d) as a real submanifold) and restriction of this representation to the real orthochronous proper Lorentz group.

Proof. The spectral property of [formula] is a direct consequence of the definition Eq. ([\ref=7eqa]), cf. the proof of Proposition 7.8 of [\cite=AGW1].

In order to prove the Laplace representation formula for [formula] we proceed by induction over [formula]. The statement for ρ = 1 is just the statement of Proposition 7.8 in [\cite=AGW1]. Note that [formula] holds in the sense of tempered distributions. Let [formula] and all other jl  <  ρ. For jl  <  ρ let jl' = jl and jl' = jl - 1 otherwhise. We then get by using Eq. ([\ref=6eqa]), the induction hypothesis as well as continuity properties of the Laplace transform and approximation of derivations by differential quotients:

[formula]

where we have made use of the explicit formulae ([\ref=7eqa]), ([\ref=7aeqa]) in the last step. The above way of deriving the [formula] as distributions w.r.t. some mass parameter can also be used to prove the temperedness inductively, since we can differentiate terms like δ  ±  ,(j)m and (|k|2 + m2) w.r.t. k02 instead of m2 and use the fact that the change of variables k02  ↔  k0 is smooth and polynomially bounded for [formula].

(ii) The Laplace representation of [formula] immediately follows from ([\ref=5eqa]), ([\ref=6eqa]) and the fact that [formula] for any tempered distribution Ŵ on [formula] with the spectral property. The rest of the theorem follows from [\cite=OS] (for the cluster property, see the proof of Theorem 7.10 of [\cite=AGW1])~  ~

By considerations similar to those proving the temperedness of the ŴTn one can also show that the sequence of tempered distributions fulfills the sufficient Hilbert space structure condition on truncated Wightman functions introduced in [\cite=AGW2]. Therefore, the sequence of Wightman functions are the vacuum expectation values of some quantum field theory in indefinite metric [\cite=AGW2] [\cite=MS].

Criteria for the existence of a scattering limit and calculation of the scattering amplitudes

In this section we replace the two point function ŴT2 given in Theorem 1 by a two point function [formula], [formula] which clearly has the same covariance properties as ŴT2. The reason for this is that in any ŴT2 there occur terms ŴT2,(ml1,j1)(ml2,j2) with ml1 = ml2 and these terms lead to "exploding" scattering behaviour, as we shall explain below. Replacing ŴT2 by T2 simply means cancelling these terms in order to obtain stable one-particle states. In some special cases this can be motivated as a "renormalization procedure", see [\cite=AIK]. We will also drop the ' and write ŴT2 for the "new" 2-point functions from now on.

We now briefly recall some basic notions of axiomatic scattering theory following [\cite=He].

For [formula] let [formula], where l,sl is a Schwartz function with values in [formula] and support in {k0l > 0,|k2l  -  m2sl| < ε} for ε small enough that non of these neighbourhoods intersect for [formula] and [formula].

We say that a sequence of truncated Wightman functions WTn has non trivial scattering behaviour, if the limits

[formula]

exist and are not identically equal to zero for n  ≥  3. Here *   stands for complex conjugation. By the following theorem we give necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the mass spectrum of D, for nontrivial scattering behaviour.

(i) The sequence WTn has nontrivial scattering behaviour, if and only if νl = 1 for [formula]. If at least one of the νl fulfills νl > 1, then the first limit in Eq. ([\ref=9eqa]) diverges polynomially in t for n  ≥  3.

(ii) If [formula], then

[formula]

if s1 = s2 and [formula] otherwhise. Here, the two ex stand for all combinations of in and out. For n  ≥  3,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. We first consider point (ii). This is a rather straight forward generalization of the Theorems 1 and 2 of [\cite=AGW3] and it can be obtained using the techniques developed there, see [\cite=Go] for the details of the proof and further generalizations. Note that the condition that QE(k) is prime w.r.t the factors (|k|2 + m2s) implies that [formula] does not vanish identically on the mass-shells and therefore the scattering amplitudes are not identically equal to zero.

It remains to prove point (i). Note that [formula] on the support of l,sl(  ±  k). Therefore we get [formula] and [formula] on these support sets. Using Parseval's theorem and integration by parts we get for the right hand side of Eq. (9)

[formula]

where [formula] is a sum over functions of the type

[formula]

where jl takes values from 1 to νl and the l are scalar functions obtained by contraction of the αll,sl with the tensor-valued polynomial [formula] and multiplication with factors 1 / k0l and thus having the same support properties as the αll,sl. If νl > 1 for some l, such functions can be written as a sum of functions of the type [formula] with [formula]. If we consider the unique term with maximal [formula], then, by (ii) of this theorem, the corresponding term in the scattering amplitude consists of an expression which converges to a constant [formula] (provided the l,sl are chosen adequately) multiplied by a factor tr. Thus, the scattering amplitude in this case diverges polynomially as t  →    ∞  . ~  ~

Theorem 2 shows that the scattering amplitudes of some of the quantum field models diverge polynomially. This is a remarkable fact, since it demonstrates that a generalization the standard axiomatic scattering theory (Haag-Ruelle theory) for quantum fields in positive metric to the case of quantum fields in indefinite metric is possible only under additional conditions (e.g. conditions on the infrared singularities of the theory).
