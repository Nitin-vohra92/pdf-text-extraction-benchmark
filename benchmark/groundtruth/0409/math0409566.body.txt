Abstract

1. Introduction

The classical object in topology and functional analysis - spaces of probability measures - is widely used in economics and game theory last ten years (see Lucas (1971), and Prescott (1971), Mas-Colell (1984), Jovanovi and Rosenthal (1988)). All this investigations deal with the notion of the set-valued correspondence map which assigns to every probability measures on the factors of the product of compacta the set of probability measures with these marginals,

[formula]

The problem of continuity of this map can be equivalently redefined in terms of openness of the characteristic map of the bicommutative diagram

[formula]

Due to the well known theorem of Ditor and Eifler (1972) the openness property of the characteristic map is closely related to the property of the bicommutativity of a normal functor and, in particular, the functor of probability measures.

A common generalization of these two properties generates a new notion of multi-commutativity of the normal function which was proposed by Kozhan and Zarichnyi (2004). In this paper they investigate the functor of probability measures and show that this functor is multi-commutative.

In the economic theory, together with the space of probability measures, different convex structures are commonly used, in particular, the spaces of convex closed subsets of the space of probability measures have very nice application.

Here the open-multicommutativity property of normal functors is investigated for functors cc, ccP, GccP and λccP.

2. Notations and definitions

Let [formula] be a finite category. Denote by [formula] the class of all objects of the category [formula]. For every [formula] the set [formula] consists of all morphisms from A to B in [formula]. A functor [formula] is called a diagram.

Definition 1. The set of morphisms

[formula]

is said to be a cone over the diagram D if and only if for every objects [formula] and for every morphism φ:A  →  B in [formula] the diagram

[formula]

is commutative.

Definition 2. Cone (1) is called a limit of the diagram D if the following condition is satisfied: for each cone [formula] there exists a unique morphism [formula] such that [formula] for every [formula].

Further, we denote this cone by [formula]. The map [formula] is called the characteristic map of [formula].

Definition 3. The cone [formula] is called open-multicommutative if the characteristic map [formula] is open and surjective.

Let F be a normal functor in the category Comp. Define the diagram [formula] in the following way: for every [formula] let [formula] and for every morphism [formula] we put [formula].

Definition 4. The normal functor [formula] is called open-multicommutative if it preserves open-multicommutative cones, i.e. the cone

[formula]

over the diagram [formula] is open-multicommutative.

For the normal functor [formula] we assume that the cone [formula] is a limit of the diagram [formula].

Let us assume that X is a compact subspace of some locally convex space E. We consider a functor [formula]. It is defined as

[formula]

Recall the constructions of well-known inclusion hyperspace and superextension functors. We set

[formula]

[formula]

For properties of the functors G and λ reader is referred to Teleiko and Zarichnyi (1999).

In order to combine these constructions with convex structure we use the defined above functors and the functor cc. In such a way we can define a space

[formula]

It is obviously that [formula] and we can endow it with the topology induced from [formula]. For a map f:X  →  Y in [formula] and [formula] let

[formula]

Thus we can define a covariant functor [formula]. In the same way we can define a functor [formula].

Due to the natural convex structure of the functor P we can compose the functors Gcc and λcc with the functor of probability measures and it gives us two new constructions of functors in the category [formula]:

3. Open-multicommutativity of the functor ccP and related functors

Proposition 1. A normal bicommutative functor [formula] is multicommutative.

Proof. This Proposition is actually proved in Kozhan and Zarichnyi (2004) for the functor of probability measures. However, in the proof they use only normality and bicommutativity of the functor P and that is why it can be applied for every normal bicommutative functor.

Q.E.D.

The following proposition is also the generalization of the result of Kozhan and Zarichnyi.

Proposition 2. A normal open functor [formula] is open-multicommutative if and only if the characteristic map

[formula]

is open for every diagram D with finite spaces [formula], [formula].

Proof. The proof is analogical to the proof of the theorem 1 in Kozhan and Zarichnyi (2004). The special properties of functor P are used only in the case of finite spaces [formula]. The rest of the proof consider only general properties of normal bicommutative functors and this implies that the scheme of the proof is the same.

Q.E.D.

Proposition 3. Functors exp , G and λ are open-multicommutative.

Proof. Let us check whether the conditions of the proposition 2 are satisfied. The functor exp  is normal and bicommutative (see Teleiko and Zarichnyi (1999)). Assume that every compactum [formula] is finite for each [formula]. Since every finite compactum [formula] is discrete space therefore [formula] is also discrete, which follows from the properties of the Vietoris' topology. It is known (see Kozhan and Zarichnyi (2004)) that [formula], which is discrete as well as [formula], is a subset of the discrete space [formula]. Thus the characteristic map χexp is the map of two discrete spaces and this necessarily implies that it is open. The spaces [formula] and [formula] for every compactum X and therefore are also discrete if X is so. Then normality and bicommutativity of them (see Proposition 2) implies the open-multicommutativity of these functors.

Q.E.D.

Lemma 1. Let B  ⊂  T  ×  T and [formula]. If C is convex set then this implies that [formula]. If in addition we have that [formula] then [formula].

Proof. Consider an arbitrary point [formula]. There exist two points x1,x2∈B and [formula] such that [formula]. Since [formula] and C is convex, [formula]. The point x is arbitrary chosen thus the first statement of the lemma is proved.

The second statement of the lemma is evident.

Q.E.D.

Proposition 4. The functor [formula] is open-multicommutative.

Proof. Let us prove that the characteristic map [formula] is open. Consider an arbitrary point [formula] and an arbitrary sequence [formula] such that lim Ci = C, where [formula]. Recall that for every compactum X with convex structure the space [formula]. Since [formula] and χexp is open map this implies that there exists a sequence [formula] such that

[formula]

for every [formula]. Denote by Di the convex hull of the set Bi. Since the function [formula] is continuous in the Vietoris topology for every compactum T with the convex structure, we see that

[formula]

Each Ci is a convex set therefore [formula] is also a convex set for every [formula] hence Lemma 1 implies that [formula] for every [formula]. Thus, the map χcc is open. The surjectivity of the characteristic map is obvious since every element in [formula] is also in [formula].

Q.E.D.

Proposition 5. Let categories Q1, Q2, [formula] and functors F1:Q1  →  Q2 and F2:Q3  →  Q1 are open-multicommutative then the composition [formula] is also open-multicommutative.

Proof. The open-multicommutativity of the functor F2 implies that the characteristic map [formula] is open and surjective. Since the functor F1 is open hence the composition [formula] is also open and surjective. Consider now a diagram D1 in the category [formula] such that for every [formula] we have [formula] and for each [formula] we have [formula]. The functor F1 is open-multicommutative, so this implies that the characteristic map [formula] is open and surjective. Thus, a map [formula] is open and surjective for any diagram D as the composition of two open and surjective maps. This implies that the functor [formula] is open-multicommutative.

Q.E.D.

Corollary 1. The functor [formula] is open-multicommutative.

Proof. This follows from the open-multicommutativity of the functors P (see Kozhan and Zarichnyi (2004)), cc (see Proposition 4) and Proposition 5.

Q.E.D.

Proposition 6. The functors Gcc and λcc are open-multicommutative.

Proof. Let us define a retraction for every

[formula]

in the following way: for every [formula]

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula].

The base of the space [formula] is formed by the sets [formula], where

[formula]

[formula]

for some open set U  ⊂  X.

Let us show that rccX is continuous for every [formula]. To prove the continuity at a point [formula] it is sufficient to show that for every element [formula] (respectively [formula]) which contains [formula] there exists a neighborhood [formula] of the point [formula] such that

[formula]

Assume first that [formula]. Denote [formula]. Then for every [formula] we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

this implies that [formula] we have [formula] and then [formula].

Assume now that [formula]. Since X is a subset of locally convex space E, there exists a base of X consisting of convex sets. This implies that we can find an open convex set V  ⊂  U. Denote [formula]. For every [formula] there is a set [formula] such that A1  ⊂  V. The set V is convex, thus [formula]. This implies that for [formula] we can find [formula] such that B1  ⊂  U and this means that [formula]. Thus, the map rcc is continuous.

Let us prove that the characteristic map [formula] is open. Consider an arbitrary point [formula] and an arbitrary net [formula] such that [formula], where [formula]. For every compactum X the space [formula] and then [formula]. Since χG is open map this implies that there exists a net [formula] such that

[formula]

for every [formula].

Denote by [formula] an image of the function rcc of the set [formula]. Since the function rcc is continuous, we see that

[formula]

Each [formula] is in [formula] and let [formula] for every [formula]. Let us prove that [formula]. For every [formula] we see that

[formula]

Lemma 1 proves that if for some [formula] the statement [formula] is satisfied for [formula] then [formula]. This implies that [formula]. On the other hand, if [formula] for some [formula] then

[formula]

This means that [formula]. Since these two inclusions are satisfied for every [formula], we have

[formula]

and it is equivalent to [formula]. This immediately implies that [formula] for every [formula]. Thus, the characteristic map χGcc is open and the functor Gcc is open-multicommutative. This map is also surjective since for every [formula] we have [formula], where

[formula]

Let us note that the restriction

[formula]

is also continuous retraction. Using this and the open-commutativity of the functor λ we can in the same way conclude that the functor λcc is also open-multicommutative.

Q.E.D.

Let us consider now the functors GccP and λccP which are defined in Teleiko and Zarichnyi (1999). Actually, [formula] for every compactum X and it is the composition of two functors Gcc and P (the same situation is for the functor λccP). The following result can be derived from Propositions 4 and 6.

Corollary 2. The functors GccP and λccP are open-multicommutative.
