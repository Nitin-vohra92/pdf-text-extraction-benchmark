Milnor fillable contact 3-manifolds

To Bernard Teissier, for his 60-th birthday

Introduction

Let x∈X be an isolated singular point of a complex analytic variety. Choose a local embedding [formula] and intersect X with small euclidian spheres centered at 0. Then the diffeomorphism type of the intersection is independent of the embedding and the (sufficiently small) spheres. Hence one gets (the diffeomorphism type of) a closed oriented manifold M(X), which is called the (abstract) boundary (or the link) of (X,x).

Now, for any fixed embedding e and small sphere (of radius [formula]), the above intersection Me,ε - being a real 1-codimensional submanifold in the complex manifold [formula] - is naturally endowed with a complex hyperplane distribution ξe,ε, with complex multiplication i|ξe,ε. Then the triple (Me,ε,ξe,ε,i|ξe,ε) is a CR-manifold. By a result of Scherk [\cite=S_86] it is an absolute invariant: it determines the analytic type of the germ (X,x). On the other hand, this CR-manifold really depends on the parameters (e,ε).

Nevertheless, one gets a well-defined intermediate invariant object by removing the complex multiplication i|ξe,ε (but keeping the orientation of ξe,ε induced by this multiplication). Indeed, Varchenko has showed in [\cite=V_80] that the couple (Me,ε,ξe,ε) is a contact manifold, which, up to a contact isotopy, only depends on the analytic type of (X,x). This isotopy type is called the contact boundary of (X,x) and denoted by (M(X),ξ(X)). In this way, one associates to any isolated singular point of a complex variety a contact manifold. (For a more general definition, see section 3.)

Let (M,ξ) be a connected closed oriented contact manifold. If there exists a germ (X,x) of (normal) complex analytic space with isolated singularity such that (M,ξ) is isomorphic to the contact boundary (M(X),ξ(X)) of (X,x), then we say that (M,ξ) admits a Milnor filling (or is Milnor fillable). The germ (X,x) is called a Milnor filling of (M,ξ).

We will use the same terminology for any manifold M (forgetting the contact structure) if M is isomorphic to the abstract boundary M(X) of some singularity x∈X.

Above, the normality assumption is not restrictive: (M(X),ξ(X)) is isomorphic to the contact boundary (M(),ξ()) of the normalization (,x̂) of (X,x).

Some natural questions arise, the most basic one being the classification of Milnor fillable contact manifolds. In this paper we will concentrate on 3-dimensional oriented manifolds. In this case the existence of a Milnor filling is a topological property and it is completely understood: an oriented 3-manifold M is Milnor fillable if and only if it is a graph-manifold obtained by plumbing along a weighted graph which has a negative definite intersection form (see Grauert [\cite=G_62]).

Our main theorem establishes the uniqueness property:

Any Milnor fillable 3-manifold admits a unique Milnor fillable contact structure up to contactomorphism.

Here some comments are in order.

(i)  All Milnor fillable contact structures are Stein fillable. Indeed, if the surface singularity (S,0) is smoothable, a simple application of Gray's Theorem shows that its contact boundary coincides with the contact boundary of any Milnor fiber, which is Stein. But even if (S,0) is not smoothable, its contact boundary can still be filled with a complex manifold (e.g., with the resolution of the singularity) and results of Bogomolov and de Oliveira (see [\cite=BO_97]) show that the complex structure of the filling can be made Stein without changing the contact boundary. In particular, Milnor fillable contact structures are tight, by a general theorem of Gromov and Eliashberg. (ii)  All these manifolds contain at least one incompressible torus, except for the lens spaces and some small Seifert spaces. Therefore, in general, by a theorem of Colin and Honda-Kazez-Mati (see Colin, Giroux and Honda [\cite=CGH_02]) all these manifolds admit infinitely many different tight contact structures up to isomorphism. In particular, theorem [\ref=mthm] indicates that Milnor fillability is a very special property of tight contact structures. (iii) Finally notice that the above classification theorem [\ref=mthm] is in a big contrast with the phenomenon valid for higher dimensional singularities. For instance, I. Ustilovsky in [\cite=U_99] discovered on the spheres S4n + 1, n  ≥  1, infinitely many different Milnor fillable contact structures. (Also, the authors know no criterions which would ensure, in general, Milnor fillability.)

In section [\ref=open], we recall the work of Giroux on contact structures and open books. The key message is that in dimension 3 any open book carries a unique contact structure up to isotopy. This description of contact structures is perfectly adapted to the contact boundaries exploited in section [\ref=sectionportage]. Here we start with a rather general definition of the contact boundary. Then we prove that any analytic function [formula] (with an isolated singularity at x) defines an open book decomposition of the boundary M(X) - we call them Milnor open books. The point is that any Milnor open book carries the natural contact structure ξ(X) (see [\ref=carry]).

We emphasize that this result is valid in any dimension and (we believe that) will be an essential tool in the further study of contact boundaries.

After all this said, the proof of theorem [\ref=mthm] runs as follows (see the end of section 4). For any Milnor fillable 3-manifold M, using its plumbing representation, we construct a link in it which is isotopic to the binding of a Milnor open book for any Milnor filling of M (see [\ref=realisation]). Then, using the work of Chaves [\cite=C_96] and Pichon [\cite=P_01], we show that all the possible Milnor open books with this binding are, in fact, isomorphic (see [\ref=ubique]).

In section [\ref=persp] we list some questions, pespectives for further studies.

A short preliminary version of this article appeared in [\cite=CP_04]. In it, theorem [\ref=mthm]   was proved for rational homology spheres. In the meantime, we succeeded to replace the old proof by a more natural one and to extend the result to all Milnor fillable 3-manifolds.

Contact structures and open books

Let M be an oriented (2n - 1)-dimensional manifold. A contact structure on M is a hyperplane distribution ξ in TM given by a global 1-form α such that [formula]. We say that the pair (M,ξ) is a contact manifold and α a contact form. The form α is called positive if [formula] defines the chosen orientation of M. If n is even, then the orientation defined by [formula] does not depend on the choice of the defining form α, hence one can speak about positive contact structures.

In the sequel we consider only oriented contact structures, i.e. ξ denotes a field of oriented hyperplanes.

If α is a contact form on M, the condition [formula] implies that dα|ξ is a symplectic form. This shows that ker (dα) is a 1-dimensional vector subspace of TM, transversal to ξ. Therefore, there exists a unique vector field R on M such that dα(R,  ·  ) = 0 and α(R) = 1. It is called the Reeb vector field associated to α.

Two contact structures ξ and ξ' on M are isotopic (resp. isomorphic or contactomorphic) if there is an isotopy (resp. a diffeomorphism) of M which sends ξ on ξ'.

For more about contact structures, see e.g. Eliashberg and Mishachev's book [\cite=EM_02].

In the study of contact manifolds one of the main tools is provided by open books carrying contact structures.

An open book with binding N in a manifold M is a couple (N,θ), where N is a (not necessarily connected) 2-codimensional closed oriented submanifold of M with trivial normal bundle and [formula] is a smooth fibration which in a neighborhood [formula] of N coincides with the angular coordinate. The fibers of θ are called the pages of the open book.

We say that the open books (N,θ) and (N',θ') in the manifolds M, respectively M', are isomorphic if there exists a diffeomorphism φ:(M,N)  →  (M',N') which preserves the orientations and carries the fibers of θ into the fibers of θ'.

Notice that dθ induces natural co-orientations on the binding and the pages of the open book. Thus, any fixed orientation of M induces a natural orientation on N. If N itself is oriented a priori, then we say that the open book is compatible with the orientations of M and N if the two orientations of N coincide.

The next criterion allows us to recognize open books. Its proof is straightforward.

Let M be an oriented closed manifold and let [formula] be a differentiable function. If there exists a number η  >  0 such that

[formula] if |φ|  ≥  η, and

[formula] if |φ|  ≤  η then (φ- 1(0), arg   φ) is an open book in M.

With the exception of [\ref=lambdarg], where one chooses the branch arg ∈( - π,π], the argument of a non-zero complex number is regarded as an element of [formula].

Next we recall the relationship between contact structures and open books.

(Giroux [\cite=G_02]) We say that a positive contact structure ξ on an oriented manifold M is carried by an open book (N,θ) if it admits a defining contact form α which verifies the following:

[formula] α induces a positive contact structure on N;

[formula] dα induces a positive symplectic structure on each fiber of θ. If a contact form α satisfies these conditions we say that it is adapted to (N,θ).

One has the following criterion for an open book to carry a contact structure:

(Giroux [\cite=G_03]) Let α be a contact form on the manifold M. Suppose that there exists an open book (N,θ) in M and a neighborhood [formula] of N such that:

[formula] θ is the normal angular coordinate in V;

[formula] α induces a positive contact structure on each submanifold N  ×  {  *  } in V;

[formula] dα induces a positive symplectic form on each fiber of θ in [formula]. Then the open book (N,θ) carries the contact structure ξ  =   ker   α.

The relevance of this notion for the study of 3-dimensional contact manifolds lies in the following result:

(Giroux [\cite=G_02], [\cite=G_03]) On a closed oriented 3-manifold, two positive contact structures carried by the same open book are isotopic.

In particular, in order to show that two contact structures on a given 3-manifold are isomorphic, it is enough to show that they are carried by isomorphic open books.

Giroux also proved that the same statement holds in all dimensions if one further asks that the two contact structures induce the same symplectic structure on the pages up to isotopy and completion (see again [\cite=G_02] and [\cite=G_03]). He also proved in collaboration with Mohsen that any contact structure is carried by an open book. Hence, in fact in any dimension, one can translate statements of contact geometry into properties of open books.

Contact boundaries and Milnor open books

Let (X,x) be an irreducible germ of a complex analytic space with isolated singularity. Sometimes, we will denote by X a sufficiently small representative of this germ. Let mX,x  ⊂  OX,x be the ideal of germs of holomorphic functions on (X,x) vanishing at x.

A. The contact boundary associated with a holomorphic immersion.

Write X* for the complex manifold [formula]. Let J:TX*  →  TX* be the operator of fiberwise multiplication by i, when TX* is seen as a real vector bundle. We will also denote it by i  ·  , when no confusion is possible. Set [formula], i.e. [formula] for any differentiable function [formula]. Then [formula].

A real function F on X* is called strictly pluri-subharmonic (spsh) if and only if [formula], that is if [formula] for any non-zero tangent vector v of X*.

For any φ1,...,φN∈mX,x consider the holomorphic map [formula] with components φi, and the real analytic function

[formula]

For each ε > 0, define

[formula]

Clearly, Mρ,ε is a smooth compact manifold for ε > 0 sufficiently small if and only if Φ is a finite analytic morphism. In the sequel we will assume that this fact holds.

On X* we consider the following natural objects associated with ρ:

[formula]

Then, on X* define:

[formula]

It is a field of complex tangent hyperplanes of the real tangent bundle of X* with its canonical almost complex structure. Moreover, it is tangent to the levels Mρ,ε of ρ. In fact:

[formula]

The following conditions are equivalent:

1) The pair (Mρ,ε,ξρ,ε) is a contact manifold for ε sufficiently small.

2) The morphism Φ is an immersion of X* into [formula].

3) The function ρ is spsh.

An easy computation shows that

[formula]

for any tangent vector fields v,w of X*. This shows that [formula] and [formula]. The lemma is an immediate consequence of this.

From now on we fix Φ, and we assume that it induces an immersion of X* into [formula]; we will briefly say that it is a holomorphic immersion. In such a case, we say that the function [formula] defined above is an euclidian rug function. In the view of the previous lemma, the objects associated with an euclidian rug function ρ have the following properties: α - restricted to the levels Mρ,ε - is a contact form, g is a riemannian metric, ω is a symplectic form compatible with the complex structure on X* and h is a hermitian metric. (Notice that not all the real analytic rug functions, e.g. as in [\cite=L_84], have all these properties, although they are perfectly good to identify the boundary manifold Mρ,ε.)

Now, using Gray's theorem (see [\cite=EM_02] for instance), it is easy to prove:

This generalizes Varchenko's result [\cite=V_80] which corresponds to the case when Φ is an embedding. Considering arbitrary holomorphic immersions and their associated rug functions (instead of embeddings and euclidean spheres) has many advantages: we not only increase the possibilities to realize the isotopy type of the natural contact structure, but it also gives possibility to compare the corresponding contact structures under finite coverings.

Suppose that (X,x) is normal. Let G be a finite group of analytic automorphisms of (X,x), acting freely and effectively on X*. Denote by (Y,y) the quotient of (X,x) by G. Then the isotopy type of (M(X),ξ(X)) admits a representative on which G acts via contactomorphisms, and the quotient is a representative of (M(Y),ξ(Y)).

Let γ:(X,x)  →  (Y,y) be the quotient map. Choose an embedding [formula] and define [formula], [formula], [formula]. Then compare the contact structures associated with these rug functions.

B. The Milnor open book associated with a holomorphic function.

Fix an f∈mX,x which defines an isolated singularity at x. Set

[formula]

For ε > 0 sufficiently small Nρ,ε(f) is smooth and naturally oriented. The argument of f restricted to [formula] gives a well-defined function

[formula]

We then have the following generalization of Milnor's Fibration Theorem (see [\cite=M_68]):

This statement splits into two parts: a fibration and an invariance result. The first one, for Φ an embedding, appears in [\cite=H_71], Satz 1.6. That proof extends to our new situation once a key fact is verified. Since this fact is used by us in other places as well, we provide its complete proof in proposition [\ref=lambdarg], after having stated two preliminary lemmas. For all the other details, we refer to [\cite=H_71]. The invariance statement can be proved similarly using the classical tools of local analytic singularities: we leave the verification to the interested reader.

(a) In fact, a fibration result has been proved in a more general context by Durfee in [\cite=D_83], but without specifying the fibration map: he actually proves that the complement of f- 1(0) in the boundary of any analytic neighborhood of a (non necessarily isolated) singularity x in X is the total space of a fibration (with no more precision about the projection map) whose fiber is homeomorphic to the intersection of a smooth fiber of f with this neighborhood. The above proposition [\ref=defmilnor] shows that, in the neighborhoods defined by euclidian rug functions, this fibration can be defined by the argument of f. A corresponding statement in the general case is not guaranteed: we use indeed the peculiar form of ρ in the computations in [\ref=lambdarg]. We also emphasize that if one wishes to verify the compatibility of an open book with a contact structure, then one needs very precise information about θ and about (a "well chosen") contact form α. This actually explains why we need the fibration to be given by the argument of f. (b) Fix the boundary M of an analytic germ (X,x) as above. In general it is extremely difficult to verify that an open book (N,θ) in M (or a link N in M) is isotopic with a Milnor open book (or link) of a function germ f on (X,x). Even in the surface case it can happen that some open book is determined by a function germ for some analytic structure of (X,x), but the same fact is not true if one modifies the analytic structure of (X,x) (see [\cite=N_99], (2.15)).

For any real function F defined on X*, its gradient [formula] will be taken with respect to the riemannian metric g. If φ∈mX,x, we also denote by [formula] its gradient with respect to the hermitian metric h, that is [formula] (φ being holomorphic, this field is well-defined).

The proof of the following lemma is straightforward:

If φ∈mX,x, one has: 1) [formula]; 2) In [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be a non-constant real analytic arc, and set [formula]. Then:

[formula]

Let h0 be the canonical hermitian form on [formula]. If [formula], then its imaginary part is [formula]. As [formula], we get:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] is the gradient with respect to the riemannian metric [formula]. Hence, we get the following equalities of functions of t (where we write briefly [formula] instead of [formula]):

[formula]

[formula]

Take now a semi-analytic neighborhood U(p) of the image of p in X* which is embedded in [formula] by Φ. Then the pair (Φ(U(p)),{0}) verifies Whitney's condition (a) at 0 (see e.g. [\cite=L_84]), which shows that the angle between the vector [formula] and the tangent space to Φ(U(p)) at the point q(t) converges to 0 when t  →  0. This implies that:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the gradient on the ambient space [formula]. From the previous computation we get:

[formula]

Let q(t) = q0tQ  +  o(tQ) be the beginning of the series expansion of q(t), where [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula], which implies:

[formula]

Using equation ([\ref=asympt]), the lemma is proved.

The next proposition - which is the key step in the proof of [\ref=defmilnor] - generalizes lemma 4.3 of [\cite=M_68] to the case of singular ambient spaces and immersions Φ (which are not necessarily embeddings). Our proof runs rather similarly, with the difference that our computations are intrinsic, they do not depend on any choice of local coordinates.

Let φ∈mX,x. For any [formula], there exists a neighborhood Uθ0 of 0 in X such that inside [formula] the following implication holds:

Suppose, by contradiction, that (*  ) does not hold. Then, by the Curve Selection Lemma (see [\cite=L_84]), there exists an analytic arc [formula] such that along it we have the equality:

[formula]

with | arg λ(t)|  ≥  θ0 for any sufficiently small t.

As [formula] by lemma [\ref=diff], part 2, we get:

[formula]

This implies:

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=lambda]) shows that the function λ(t) has a Laurent expansion of type:

[formula]

Consider now the other two expansions as well:

[formula]

From the first one we deduce:

[formula]

Combining them with lemma [\ref=arc] and with equation ([\ref=lambda]), we get:

[formula]

Since ([\ref=laurlambda]) and ([\ref=exprl]) contradict the hypothesis | arg   λ(t)|  ≥  θ0, the proposition is proved.

C. The Milnor open books carry the natural contact structure on the boundary.

Let us summarize: we have associated to any isolated singularity (X,x) a well-defined contact structure on its boundary Mρ,ε, and to any function f∈mX,x with an isolated singularity an open book (Nρ,ε(f),θε(f)) on Mρ,ε. These two objects are naturally related:

Let (X,x) be a complex analytic variety having an isolated singularity at x, and let [formula] be a holomorphic function having also an isolated singularity. Then the Milnor open book (Nρ,ε(f),θε(f)) of f carries the natural contact structure on the boundary Mρ,ε of X.

(a) Theorem [\ref=carry] stengthens a result of Giroux (see [\cite=G_03] for more details) and generalizes it to a singular ambient space: Giroux's original proof is valid only up to isotopy, the contact boundary Mρ,ε being replaced there by one of its deformations - a level of the function ρc: = ρ + c|f|2, for c  ≫  1. (b) The particular case of the function z0∈mXk,0 with [formula] has been studied by Van Koert and Niederkrüger in [\cite=vKN_04], in relation with Ustilovsky's spheres. (c) Theorem [\ref=carry] has the following consequence. Let us fix the analytic germ (X,x). Then all the open books associated with all the possible holomorphic function germs f (with isolated singularity at x) determine (up to isotopy) the same contact structure. Notice also that function germs f with isolated singularity always exist. Indeed, once an embedding of (X,x) into [formula] is chosen, it is enough to take the restriction to X of a linear form whose kernel is not a limit of tangent hyperplanes to [formula] (see Lê, Teissier [\cite=LT_88] for details).

We start the proof of [\ref=carry] with some lemmas.

Fix an euclidian rug function [formula]. For ε sufficiently small, the 1-form [formula] defines the natural contact structure on the smooth level Mρ,ε  =  ρ- 1(ε). Denote R∈Γ(Mρ,ε,TMρ,ε) its Reeb vector field.

The Reeb vector field R of α is given by [formula]. Moreover, the contact distribution ξρ,ε on Mρ,ε is exactly the orthogonal complement of [formula] in TX*|Mρ,ε with respect to the hermitian form h associated with ρ.

Since R is a generator of the kernel of ω restricted to TMρ,ε, on TX*|Mρ,ε we have ιRω = kdρ for some [formula]. This shows that on TX*|Mρ,ε one has

[formula]

Since ω is non-degenerate on TX*|Mρ,ε, this shows that [formula]. Hence

[formula]

which proves the first statement. For the second statement, it suffices to notice that

[formula]

for any section v of ξρ,ε (here we use that i.v is also a section of ξρ,ε).

Fix c > 0, and put αc: = e- c|f|2α. If Rc denotes the Reeb vector field of αc, on [formula] one has:

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the projection parallel to [formula].

Put H: = e- c|f|2. Put also Rc: = k(R + Sc), where Sc∈Γ(Mρ,ε,ξρ,ε) and [formula]. In fact,

[formula]

hence one has k = 1 / H. Now,

[formula]

which, when applied to Rc = (1 / H)(R + Sc) and restricted to ξ: = ξρ,ε  =   ker α gives

[formula]

But on TX*, lemma [\ref=diff] implies that

[formula]

In particular, [formula]. But dα|ξ  =  ω|ξ is non-degenerate and [formula] for any v∈TX*|Mρ,ε. Hence, we get

[formula]

which shows that

[formula]

the last equality being a consequence of the second statement of the preceding lemma [\ref=reeb]. Since [formula], we are done.

Fix a sufficiently small representative of X so that [formula] on [formula] whenever a relation of the form [formula] holds (see [\ref=lambdarg]). Consider also ε > 0 sufficiently small. Now let η > 0 be sufficiently small to ensure that all the fibers f- 1(t)  ⊂  X cut Mρ,ε transversally for |t|2  ≤  η. Denote

[formula]

the corresponding tubular neighborhood of the binding Nρ,ε(f) in Mρ,ε. Then clearly θ is a normal angular coordinate on this neighborhood [formula]. Moreover, each submanifold [formula], being a level of the strictly plurisubharmonic function ρ on the complex manifold [formula], is a positive contact submanifold of Mρ,ε. Thus lemma [\ref=crit2] will imply theorem [\ref=carry] if we can find a convenient c > 0 such that dαc induces a positive symplectic form on each fiber of θ in [formula]. But this is exactly equivalent to the inequality dθ(Rc) > 0.

Now, there is a m > 0 such that dθ(R)  ≥   - m on the compact set [formula]. Put

[formula]

Since Zε is compact, k is well defined. If k > 0, then for c: = m / k we will always have dθ(Rc) > 0 on [formula] by lemma [\ref=formula], and the theorem is proved.

Next, assume k = 0. This means that there is a p∈Zε so that [formula]. But this implies that [formula] for some [formula]. Our initial choice of the representative X (see [\ref=lambdarg]) implies that [formula]. But then

[formula]

which is impossible since p∈Zε.

Construction of an ubiquitous Milnor open book

In this section we will restrict ourselves to normal surface singularities (see [\cite=N_99] for further references) and we construct for any given 3-manifold M - which is the boundary of some Milnor filling - an open book decomposition, which is isomorphic to a Milnor open book for any Milnor filling of M.

A. A sufficient condition to be the exceptional part of the divisor of a function.

We start with some notations. Let (S,0) be the germ of a normal complex analytic surface singularity. Fix a good resolution p:(Σ,E)  →  (S,0). Namely, Σ is smooth, p is proper and realizes an isomorphism over S  -  {0} and finally the set-theoretical fibre E: = p- 1(0) is a normal crossing divisor in Σ having smooth irreducible components [formula]. For each i, we denote by gi the genus, respectively by vi: = Ei  ·  (E - Ei) the valency of Ei seen as a vertex of the dual graph of E. In general, we prefer to fix a Stein representative S of (S,0) and to set Σ = p- 1(S).

As usual, |D| denotes the support of the divisor D of Σ. Then, for any D, there exists a unique decomposition D = De  +  Ds such that |De|  ⊂  E and [formula]. Notice that f∈mS,0 defines an isolated singularity at 0 if and only if [formula] in Σ is reduced. The next theorem guarantees the existence of a function germ f with prescribed exceptional part [formula] which is resolved by p, that is, such that [formula] is a normal crossing divisor. Notice that in such a case, the number ni of components of [formula] (all of them smooth) intersecting Ei is determined by [formula]: indeed, ni =  - D  ·  Ei for any i, as [formula].

Let p:(Σ,E)  →  (S,0) be a good resolution of a normal surface singularity (S,0) as above. Assume that the effective divisor [formula] satisfies

[formula]

Then there exists a function f∈mS,0, with an isolated singularity at 0, such that [formula] is a normal crossing divisor on Σ with [formula]. Moreover, for each i, the number of intersection points [formula] is strictly positive.

We refer to [\cite=R_97] for an introduction to the methods used in this proof.

First notice that The right member is strictly positive, except when E = E1 is just a rational curve. But in this case, D = m1E1 and E21 < 0, proving that n1 > 0. This answers the last statement.

For the existence of f, consider the exact sequence

[formula]

Clearly, H1(OΣ( - D - E)) = H1(OΣ(KΣ + A)), where A: =  - D - E - KΣ, with A  ·  Ei  ≥  2 for any i. Therefore, this last group is vanishing by the Laufer-Ramanujam theorem (see [\cite=L_72] (3.2) or [\cite=R_72]; it is also called the 'generalized' Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem). This shows that π:H0(OΣ( - D))  →  H0(OE( - D)) is onto.

Next, we show that OE( - D) = ωE(A|E) is generated by global sections. Firstly, if q is a smooth point of E, then one has to show that there exists a global section s of ωE(A|E) with s(q) nonzero. For this it is enough to verify that [formula] is onto, or H1(ωE(A|E - q)) = H0(OE( - A|E + q)) is zero. But this last group is vanishing indeed, since - A + q is still negative on each component Ei. Similarly, if [formula], with local coordinates (x,y) such that (E,q) = {xy = 0}, then it is convenient to consider the ideal sheaf I generated by x + y. Then [formula] is still locally free and its degree drops by one on both Ei and Ej, hence again [formula].

Finally notice that the projective morphism [formula] induced by the globally generated OE( - D) is finite. Indeed, assume that φ(Ei) is a point. Then the general hyperplane section of [formula] misses this point, which implies D  ·  Ei = 0 contradicting (*  ).

Hence, if one takes s∈H0(OΣ( - D)) with π(s) a generic element of H0(OE( - D)), then [formula] for some f with the wanted properties.

A divisor D which verifies the hypothesis in this theorem always exists (since the intersection form is negative definite). Moreover, one can also assume that D is fixed by the automorphism group of the weighted dual graph of p.

B. Vertical links and horizontal open books in plumbed manifolds.

Let Γ be a finite connected weighted (plumbing) graph with r vertices A1,...,Ar. Each vertex Ai is weighted with two integers (gi,ei), with gi  ≥  0. Let M(Γ) be the oriented closed 3-manifold obtained from Γ by plumbing (see Mumford [\cite=M_61] and Neumann [\cite=N_81]). Briefly, this construction runs as follows. We associate with each vertex Ai an oriented circle bundle pi:Mi  →  Si with Euler number ei, where Si is an oriented compact connected real surface of genus gi, then we glue these 3-manifolds according to the edges of the graph.

Let M(Γ) be a plumbed 3-manifold. To any r-tuple [formula] of non-negative integers one associates a link N() in M(Γ) as follows. For each i, consider ni generic fiber of the circle bundle Mi  →  Si, then N() is their union, where [formula]. Any such link is called vertical.

Any vertical link is naturally oriented by the orientations of the fibers.

Let M(Γ) be a plumbed manifold. A horizontal open book in M(Γ) is an open book (N(),θ) whose binding is a vertical link, whose (open) pages are transversal to the fibers of the bundles Mi  →  Si, and which is compatible with the orientations.

The main example is provided by normal surface singularities and germs of analytic functions (see [\cite=N_81]). Indeed, for any fixed good resolution p, the dual resolution graph Γ(p) serves as a plumbing graph, and the boundary M(S) is diffeomorphic to the plumbed manifold M(Γ(p)). Moreover, if f∈mS,0 defines an isolated singularity at 0, and [formula] is a normal crossing divisor, then the Milnor open book (N(f),θ(f)) defined in M(S) is isomorphic to a horizontal open book (N(),θ) in M(Γ(p)), where each ni is exactly the number of components of the strict transform [formula] which cut Ei.

Let Γ be a connected weighted plumbing graph with r vertices whose associated intersection form I(Γ) is non-degenerate. Let [formula] be a r-tuple of strictly positive integers. Then any two horizontal open books in M(Γ) with binding N() are isomorphic.

In order to prove the proposition, we only have to collect some existing results from the literature (all of them stated in [\cite=P_01]). The sequence of arguments is the following.

Any isomorphism class of open book can be characterized completely by the conjugacy class of the monodromy h acting on the page F of the open book. In the case of plumbed (or graph) manifolds, one can take for the monodromy a quasi-periodical homeomorphism. In [\cite=N_37] and [\cite=N_44] Nielsen associated with such a homeomorphism the (so called) Nielsen graph. From this graph, in general, one cannot recover the conjugacy class of h; but Chaves in [\cite=C_96] completed this graph by some additional decorations - in this way constructing the 'completed Nielsen graph' - and proved that this completed graph characterizes completely the conjugacy class of the quasi-periodical homemomorphism h.

On the other hand, Pichon in [\cite=P_01] (see especially section 4) describes the combinatorial relationship connecting the completed Nielsen graph and the plumbing graph Γ' of the vertical link N()  ⊂  M. (Here Γ' is obtained from the plumbing graph Γ of M by adding arrowheads corresponding to the link components.) In general, the completed Nielsen graph contains more information, and cannot be recovered from Γ' (see [\ref=nonisot],b). Nevertheless, if each ni is strictly positive, then Γ' determines completely the completed Nielsen graph (see Algorithm 4.8 of [\cite=P_01]). This ends our proof as well.

For the convenience of the reader we provide a few more details. Recall that Γ codifies the intersection matrix I(Γ) = {Ei  ·  Ej}i,j represented in a fixed basis {Ei}i. In the proof of [\ref=realisation], (*  ) provides ni as [formula]. These 'multiplicities' {mj}j constitute a part of the decorations of the Nielsen graphs. Since I(Γ) is non-degenerate, they can be computed from the integers {ni}i.

The plumbing construction provides a decomposition [formula] of M(Γ), where Vi is an S1-bundle over [formula]. Let F be the page of an open book with binding N(), and set [formula] for each i. Let ri be the number of connected components of Fi. It turns out that ri divides mi. The point is that, basically, the additional information contained in the Nielsen graph (associated with the monodromy of the open book), compared with Γ', is exactly the collection of the integers {ri}i. It may help to think about this in the following intuitive picture: one may construct a 'covering graph' of Γ' (which is equivalent with the Nielsen graph) by putting ri vertices above the vertex Ai of Γ' (and there is a similar covering procedure for edges as well). If the integers ri are larger than one, it can happen that for the same collection of {ri}i's more covering types can appear. This global twisting data is the additional information in the completed Nielsen graph, but which is superfluous as soon as ri = 1 for all i.

In our case, since ni > 0 for all i, analysing tubular neighbourhoods of the link components, we easily realize that each Fi is connected, i.e. ri = 1. Therefore, the completed Nielsen graph and Γ' codify the same amount of information.

(a) In the context of [\ref=invariant], the two open books are not isotopic in general. Indeed, one can take the image of any horizontal open book by a convenient 3-dimensional Dehn-twist, that is a self-diffeomorphism of M(Γ) which is the identity outside a regular neighborhood of a"vertical torus" and which preserves the foliation by circles inside this regular neighborhood. (b) If some components of [formula] are allowed to vanish, then [\ref=invariant] fails (see e.g. [\cite=N_00] and [\cite=P_01]). (c) In [\cite=CP_04], the main result [\ref=mthm] was established only for Milnor fillable 3-manifolds which are rational homology spheres because the authors were not conscious of [\ref=invariant]. Instead, they used the fact, easily deducible from results of Stallings and Waldhausen, that in such a 3-manifold an open book is determined up to isotopy by its binding alone.

Let M be a closed connected oriented 3-manifold which is Milnor fillable. Then there exists an open book (N,θ) in M, which can be completely characterized by the topology of M, such that, for any germ (S,0) of normal complex surface with M≃M(S), there exists a function f∈mS,0 having an isolated singularity at 0 whose Milnor open book (N(f),θ(f)) is isomorphic to (N,θ).

First notice that by the work of Neumann [\cite=N_81] the homeomorphism type of M determines the dual weighted graph Γ(p0) of the minimal good resolution p0:(Σ0,E0)  →  (S,0) of any Milnor filling (S,0) of M.

Fix any of these fillings. Then choose an exceptional divisor D in Σ0 as in [\ref=realisation]. This choice only depends on Γ(p0), that is, on the topology of M. Then apply [\ref=realisation] and [\ref=invariant].

The notion of good resolution used in [\cite=N_81] does not coincide with the one we use here. The difference is that we ask the components Ei to be smooth, while in [\cite=N_81] self-intersections are allowed. Nevertheless, minimal good resolutions exist and are unique for both definitions, and the way to pass from one to the other can be completely described using the associated weighted dual resolution graphs. Hence, Neumann's result quoted before and proved in [\cite=N_81] for his definition implies the analogous result for our definition.

Let M be a closed connected oriented 3-manifold. By corollary [\ref=ubique], there exists an open book (N,θ) in M which is isomorphic to a Milnor open book (N(f),θ(f)) in any Milnor filling M(S) of M. Now each of these Milnor open books carries the corresponding contact structure (M(S),ξ(S)) by theorem [\ref=carry]. Since they are all isomorphic to (N,θ), theorem [\ref=giroux] shows that these contact structures are also all isomorphic.

Concluding remarks

In 3-manifolds which are circle bundles over oriented surfaces of genus > 0 with negative Euler number, there is only one isotopy class of contact structure transversal to the fibers: see Giroux [\cite=G_01]. Since any Milnor fillable contact structure on such a manifold has this property, this shows that, in this case, its isotopy class is well defined (and not only its isomorphism class; we use here the fact, due to Waldhausen, that in this case the fibration is well defined up to isotopy). This, together with Remark [\ref=nonisot] c), has to be compared with Remark [\ref=nonisot] a), where we insisted on the (a priori) non-isotopy between horizontal open books sharing the same binding.

Notice also that the homotopy type (as an unoriented 2-plane field) of a Milnor fillable contact structure is well defined (it is invariant up to isotopy by the group [formula] of self-diffeomorphisms of M which preserve the orientation). Firstly, two oriented plane fields which are positively transversal to the oriented fibers of the plumbing structure are homotopic (as one can see by taking an auxiliary Riemannian metric and rotating at each point one plane into the other by the unique shortest path). Secondly, one can deduce from Neumann's work [\cite=N_81] that the plumbing decomposition (with unoriented fibres) which corresponds to the minimal good resolution is unique up to isotopy, which shows that it is invariant by [formula], up to isotopy.

Moreover, using this last invariance and the results of [\cite=CP_04], we see that on a Milnor fillable rational homology sphere all Milnor fillable contact structures are isotopic.

One can also ask the following general questions about the unique Milnor fillable contact structure ξ(M) (up to contactomorphism) on a Milnor fillable 3-manifold M.

Question 1 Characterize the subgroup of [formula] which fixes ξ(M) up to isotopy (here Remark [\ref=symmetry] should be useful; as said before, we know that on Milnor fillable rational homology spheres we get the whole group).

Question 2 Find the Ozsváth-Szabó contact invariant associated with ξ(M) (see [\cite=OS_02] for its definition).

Question 3 For each incompressible torus T  ⊂  M, find its associated torsion.

The notion of torsion of a contact structure originates in Giroux's article [\cite=G_94]. It can be refined as a function defined on the set of isotopy classes of incompressible tori in M, with values in [formula]. See Colin, Giroux, Honda [\cite=CGH_02] for its use in the classification of tight contact structures on a given 3-manifold. If one believes in the manifestation in this context of a principle of economy of algebraic geometry, one could conjecture that the torsion of any incompressible torus in M is equal to 0.

Question 4 Given a Milnor fillable 3-manifold, evaluate the number of pairwise non-contactomorphic Stein fillable contact structures on it. In particular, does there exist an example with an infinite number of such structures?

Notice that on the lens spaces, which are Milnor fillable manifolds, all tight contact structures are classified up to isotopy (see Giroux [\cite=G_00]): there is a finite number of them, they are all Stein fillable and, with the exception of one or two, they are virtually overtwisted.
