Transformation Digroups

The purpose of this paper is to show how to choose a class of non-bijective transformations on a Cartesian product of two sets to define a transformation digroup on the Cartesian product. The main result of this paper is that every digroup is isomorphic to a transformation digroup.

The notion of a digroup we shall use in this paper was introduced in Chapter 6 of [\cite=Liu2]. Its special case, which is the notion of a digroup with an identity, was introduced independently by people who work in different areas of mathematics ([\cite=Felipe], [\cite=Kinyon1] and [\cite=Liu1]).

After reviewing some basic definitions about digroups in Section 1, we introduce in Section 2 the notion of a symmetric digroup on the Cartesian product Δ  ×  Γ, where Δ and Γ are two sets. If |Δ| = 1, then a symmetric digroup on Δ  ×  Γ becomes the symmetric group on the set Γ , where |Δ| denotes the cardinality of Δ. In Section 3 we prove that every digroup is isomorphic a subdigroup of a symmetric digroup, which is a better counterpart of Cayley's Theorem in the context of digroups.

The Notion of a Digroup

The following definition of a digroup is a version of Definition 6.1 of [\cite=Liu2].

A nonempty set G is called a digroup if there are two binary operations [formula] and [formula] on G such that the following three properties are satisfied.

for all x,y,z∈G.

for all x∈G.

The diassociative law was introduced by J. -L. Loday to study Leibniz algebras. An element e satisfying ([\ref=eq1.4]) is called a bar-unit, and the set of all bar-units is called the halo ([\cite=Loday2]). The two elements [formula] and [formula] are called a left inverse and a right inverse of x with respect to the bar-unit e, respectively ([\cite=Liu2]). The binary operations [formula] and [formula] are called the left product and the right product, respectively. We also use [formula] to signify that G is a digroup with the left product [formula] and the right product [formula].

Both the left inverse [formula] and the right inverse [formula] of an element x with respect to a bar-unit e is unique (Proposition 6.1 in [\cite=Liu2]), but [formula] is generally not equal to [formula] (Proposition 6.2 in [\cite=Liu2]).

The next proposition shows that Definition [\ref=def1.1] of a digroup is independent of the choice of the bar-unit e.

Let G be a digroup. If α is a bar-unit of G, then every element x of G has both the left inverse [formula] and the right inverse [formula] with respect to α; that is,

[formula]

Proof By Definition [\ref=def1.1], there is a bar-unit e of G such that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

which proves that

[formula]

If G is a digroup, then the halo of G is denoted by [formula]; that is

[formula]

Let [formula] be a digroup. An element e of G is called an identity of G if e∈ and

[formula]

By Proposition 6.2 in [\cite=Liu2], if e is a bar-unit of G, then e is an identity of a digroup G if and only if [formula] for all x∈G. Example 6 in [\cite=Liu2] gives a digroup which does not have an identity.

We now introduce the notion of a subdigroup.

Let H be a subset of a digroup [formula]. If [formula] and H is itself a digroup under the two binary operations of G, we say that H is a subdigroup of G. The notation H  ≤  dG is used to indicate that H is a subdigroup of G.

The following definition introduces two important subdigroups of a digroup.

Let [formula] be a digroup.

is called the target center of G.

is called the source center of G.

One can check that the target center Zt(G) is a subdigroup of a digroup G and

[formula]

If G is a digroup with an identity, then the source center Zs(G) is a subdigroup of G.

We finish this section with the definition of an isomorphism between digroups.

If G and [formula] are digroups, then a map φ from G to [formula] is called an isomorphism if φ is bijective and

[formula]

for all x,y∈G and [formula].

Symmetric Digroups

Let T(Δ  ×  Γ) be the set of all maps from Δ  ×  Γ to Δ  ×  Γ, where Δ and Γ are two sets. Then T(Δ  ×  Γ) is a semigroup with the identity 1 under the product:

[formula]

where 1 is the identity map, and the product f  ·  g is the composite of g and f ( f following g ):

[formula]

An element [formula] of T(Δ  ×  Γ) is called a [formula]-map on Δ  ×  Γ if there exists an element (s,f)∈Δ  ×  SymΓ such that

[formula]

where SymΓ is the symmetric group on Γ.

It is clear that the element (s,f) in Definition [\ref=def4.1] is determined uniquely by the [formula]-map [formula]. Hence, [formula] in Definition [\ref=def4.1] is also called the [formula]-map on Δ  ×  Γ induced by (s,f)∈Δ  ×  SymΓ. We shall use the notation [formula] to indicate that the [formula]-map induced by (s,f). Thus, we have

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be two [formula]-maps on Δ  ×  Γ. If (k,i)∈Δ  ×  Γ, then

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq4.1]). Hence, we have

[formula]

If G is a subgroup of SymΓ, then the set

[formula]

is a subsemigroup of T(Δ  ×  SymΓ) having the following two properties:

[formula] has a right unit [formula], where 0 is a fixed element of Δ.

Every element [formula] of [formula] has a left inverse [formula] in [formula] with respect to the right unit [formula].

Proof It is clear by ([\ref=eq4.2]).

Let G be a subgroup of SymΓ, and let θ:G  →  SymΔ be a group homomorphism.

is a group homomorphism from G to Sym(Δ  ×  Γ), where f:Δ  ×  Γ  →  Δ  ×  Γ is defined by

f will be called a θ-permutation on Δ  ×  Γ.

Proof (i) It is clear that f∈Sym(Δ  ×  Γ) by ([\ref=eq4.3]). For f, g∈G and (k,i)∈Δ  ×  Γ, we have

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

This proves that the map f  ↦  f is a group homomorphism.

(ii) For (k,i)∈Δ  ×  Γ, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence, (ii) is true.

Motivated by the facts in [\cite=Liu1], we introduce the construction of a transformation digroup in the next proposition.

If G is a subgroup of SymΓ and θ:G  →  SymΔ is a group homomorphism, then [formula] is a digroup under the following two binary operations:

[formula]

where (s,f), (t,g)∈Δ  ×  G. [formula] is a bar-unit, and the left inverse and the right inverse of an element with respect to the bar-unit [formula] are given by

[formula]

Proof For (s,f), (t,g) and (v,h)∈Δ  ×  G, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This proves that the two binary operations [formula] and [formula] are diassociative. The remaining parts are clear by ([\ref=eq4.7]) and ([\ref=eq4.8]).

A subdigroup of [formula] is called the transformation digroup on Δ  ×  Γ induced by [formula]. In particular, the digroup [formula] is called the symmetric digroup on Δ  ×  Γ induced by the group homomorphism θ:SymΓ  →  SymΔ. It is clear that the symmetric digroup becomes the symmetric group on Γ if |Δ| = 1.

We finish this section with the description of the halo and subdigroups of [formula].

Let [formula] be the transformation digroup on Δ  ×  Γ induced by [formula]. Let Z(G) be the center of the group G. Then

is the stabilizer of s∈Δ in SymΔ.

Proof The results follow from ([\ref=eq4.7]) and ([\ref=eq4.8]).

The Counterpart of Cayley's Theorem

In this section we prove that every digroup is isomorphic to a transformation digroup. We begin with the following property of left translations.

Let e be a bar-unit of a digroup G and let [formula] be a map defined by

[formula]

where g∈G, [formula] and

[formula]

If f∈G, then [formula], where

[formula]

Proof It is clear that φ is surjective. Hence, [formula] is not empty for all i∈. Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Using the properties of left translations and ([\ref=eq4.10]), we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

It follow from ([\ref=eq4.10]) and ([\ref=eq4.11]) that

[formula]

Since [formula] is a permutation on G, [formula] can be regarded as a permutation on Γ by ([\ref=eq4.12]).

For an element f of a digroup G, we define a map Ψf:G  →  G by

[formula]

where e is a bar-unit of G. Since the definition of Ψf is independent of the choice of the bar-unit e, ([\ref=eq3.1]) is also written as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] denote the left inverse and the right inverse of f with respect to any bar-unit, respectively.

It is clear that Ψf can be regarded as a permutation on the halo of G.

If G is a digroup, then

[formula]

is a group homomorphism from the subgroup [formula] of SymΓ to Sym  , where

[formula]

Proof θ is well-defined. In fact, if f, g∈G and [formula], then [formula] for a bar-unit e of G. For all x∈G, we have

[formula]

Hence, Ψf  =  Ψg.

Since

[formula]

θ is a group homomorphism.

Let G be a digroup. By Proposition [\ref=pr4.5] and Proposition [\ref=pr4.6], [formula] is a transformation digroup on Δ  ×  Γ induced by [formula], where

[formula]

We now define a map λ from G to [formula] by

[formula]

First, we prove that λ is well-defined. Every element of G is of the form [formula] for some α∈ and f∈G. If [formula], where α,β∈ and f, g∈G, then α  =  β and [formula] or [formula]. It follows that [formula]. This proves that λ is well-defined.

Next, we prove that λ is injective. For α, β∈ and f, g∈G, we have

[formula]

Finally, we prove that λ preserves both the left product and the right product on G. For α, β∈ and f, g∈G, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus we get the following counterpart of Cayley's Theorem.

Any digroup is isomorphic to a transformation digroup.
