The λ - dimension of commutative arithmetic rings

Introduction, definitions and preliminaries

All rings in this paper are commutative with unity and modules are unitary. Following P. Vámos [\cite=Vam], if P is a ring property, we say that a ring R is locally P if RM has P for every maximal ideal M, and R is fractionnally P if the classical quotient ring Q(R / A) of R / A has P for every proper ideal A of R.

An R-module E is said to be of finite n-presentation if there exists an exact sequence:

[formula]

with the Fi's free R-modules of finite rank. We write λR(E)  =   sup {n| there is a finite n-presentation of E}. If E is not finitely generated we also put λR(E) =   -  1.

The λ-dimension of a ring R (λ-dim (R)) is the least integer n (or ∞   if none such exists) such that λR(E)  ≥  n implies λR(E)  =    ∞  . See [\cite=Vas]. Recall that R is noetherian if and only if λ-dim (R)  =  0 and R is coherent if and only if λ-dim (R)  ≤  1.

This notion of λ-dimension of a ring was formulated in [\cite=Vas] to study the rings of polynomials or power series over a coherent ring.

In section [\ref=S:dim] of this paper it is proved that every arithmetic ring has a λ-dimension ≤  3. We give an example of a Kaplanky ring whose the λ-dimension is exactly 3. However, if an arithmetic ring satisfies an additional property,(reduced, self fp-injective, semi-local, CF or fractionnally self-injective), its λ-dimension is at most 2.

In section [\ref=S:frac] we study fractionnally self fp-injective rings. We prove that every reduced factor ring of a fractionnally self fp-injective ring is semihereditary. It is shown that each fractionnally self fp-injective ring which is Bézout is Kaplansky. To state this last result, we give a positive answer to a question of Henriksen by proving that any Bézout ring with compact minimal prime spectrum is Hermite.

An R-module E is said to be uniserial if the set of its submodules is totally ordered by inclusion. A ring R is a valuation ring if R is a uniserial module, and R is arithmetic if R is locally a valuation ring. A ring is a Bézout ring if every finitely generated ideal is principal. A ring R is an Hermite ring if R satisfies the following property : for every (a,b)∈R2, there exist d,a',b' in R such that a  =  da', b  =  db' and Ra'  +  Rb'  =  R. We say that R is a Kaplansky ring (or an elementary divisor ring) if for every matrix A, with entries in R, there exist a diagonal matrix D and invertible matrices P and Q, with entries in R, such that PAQ  =  D. Then we have the following implications :

Kaplansky ring ⇒   Hermite ring ⇒   Bézout ring ⇒   arithmetic ring ;

but these implications are not reversible [\cite=GiHe1] or [\cite=Car].

Recall that R is a Kaplansky ring if and only if every finitely presented module is a finite direct sum of cyclic finitely presented modules ([\cite=Kap] and [\cite=LLS]). We say that R is an adequate ring if R is a Bézout ring satisfying the following property : for every (a,b)∈R2, [formula], there exist r and s in R such that a  =  rs, Rr + Rb  =  R, and if s' is a nonunit that divides s, then [formula]. An exact sequence 0  →  F  →  E  →  G  →  0 is pure if it remains exact when tensoring it with any R-module. In this case we say that F is a pure submodule of E. When R is an arithmetical ring then F is a pure submodule of E if and only if [formula] for every r∈R, [\cite=War].

The following proposition will be useful to provide us many examples in the second part of this paper.

Let I be an infinite set, D a valuation domain and N its maximal ideal. We consider

[formula]

. Then the following statements are true.

S is a free D-module with basis [formula] where [formula], and [formula], for every j∈I, and where δij is the Kronecker symbol.

[formula] and [formula], for every i∈I, are the maximal ideals of S. Moreover, SM0≃D and SMi≃D for every i∈I. The Jacobson radical [formula].

S is a Kaplansky ring and an adequate ring.

Proof.

This assertion is obvious.

Let M be a maximal ideal of R. If [formula], for every i∈I, then M  =  M0. The ideal E of S generated by [formula] is a pure ideal of S, hence S / E is a flat S-module and S / E≃D. From this we deduce that SM0≃D. If there exists i∈I such that [formula], then [formula] and we have M  =  Mi. Moreover, [formula] is a projective S-module and [formula]. We deduce that SMi≃D. Now, it is easy to get that [formula].

By using the basis B of S over D, it is easy to prove that S is an Hermite ring and an adequate ring. From [\cite=GiHe2] we deduce that S is a Kaplansky ring.

An R-module E is fp-injective if [formula] for any finitely presented R-module F, and R is self fp-injective if R is fp-injective as R-module. Recall that a valuation ring R is self fp-injective if and only if the set Z(R) of its zero divisors is its maximal ideal, [\cite=Cou]. We recall that a module E is fp-injective if and only if it is a pure submodule of every overmodule.

We denote respectively Spec(R), MaxSpec(R) and MinSpec(R), the space of prime ideals, maximal ideals, and minimal prime ideals of R, with the Zariski topology. If X  =  Spec(R),MaxSpec(R) or MinSpec(R), and A a subset of R, then we denote V(A)  =  {P∈X|A  ⊆  P} and [formula].

Finally if E is an R-module, flat-dim (E) is the least integer n such that [formula] for every R-module F, and gl-w-dim (R)  =   sup {flat-dim (E)|E  R-module}.

The λ-dimension

We begin with the more general result of this part.

Let R be an arithmetic ring. Then the following statements are true.

λ-dim (R)  ≤  3.

If R is a reduced ring then λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

Proof.

Let E be a module such that λR(E)  ≥  3. We consider the following finite 3-presentation of E:

[formula]

We choose bases B0 and B1 of F0 and F1 respectively, and let A be the matrix associated with u1, with respect to our given bases. Let M be a maximal ideal of R. By [\cite=War] EMis a direct sum of cyclic finitely presented RM-modules. Therefore there exist a diagonal matrix D and two invertible matrices P and Q, with entries in RM such that PAQ  =  D. It is not difficult to find [formula] such that P and Q are invertible matrices with entries in Rt, D a diagonal matrix with entries in R such that PAQ  =  D. It follows that there exist [formula] such that [formula] Since λRt(Et)  ≥  2, we deduce that (0:Rtak) is a finitely generated ideal of Rt, and there exists bk∈R, such that (0:RMak)  =  bkRM, for every k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n. By multiplying t with an element of [formula] we may assume that (0:Rtak)  =  bkRt for every k,1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Now, since λRt(Et)  ≥  3, by the same way, we get that there exists ck∈R, such that (0:Rtbk)  =  ckRt for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Then, the equality (0:Rtak)  =  bkRt implies that (0:Rtck)  =  bkRt, for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Hence λRt(Et)  ≥  4.

If we denote UM  =  D(t), then (UM)M∈MaxSpec(R) is an open overing of MaxSpec(R), and since this space is quasi-compact, a finite number of these open subsets cover MaxSpec(R). Thus, [formula] where Uj  =  D(tj). Let K  =  ker(u3). Now, for every j, 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, Ktj is a finitely generated Rtj-module, hence there exists a finite subset Gj of K such that [formula] Then K is generated by [formula] and we get that λR(E)  ≥  4.

If R is reduced, then RM is a valuation domain for every maximal ideal M of R. Consequently gl-w-dim (R)  ≤  1, and from [\cite=Vas] we deduce that λ-dim (R)  ≤  2. We can also deduce this result from our following Corollary [\ref=C:wdone].

The example 1.3b of [\cite=Vas] is a reduced arithmetic ring of λ-dimension 2. Now, to complete the proof of our Theorem [\ref=T:dimain], an example of arithmetic ring with λ-dimension 3 must be given.

Let R be an arithmetic ring.

If R is self fp-injective then λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

Proof. Let E be a module with λR(E)  ≥  2. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:dimain], for every M∈MaxSpec(R), we can find [formula], [formula], [formula] such that [formula] and (0:Rtak)  =  bkRt for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n.

Since λR(E)  ≥  2, then the canonical homomorphism [formula] is an isomorphism. Thus [formula] and [formula] for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. From the following projective resolution of Rt / akRt : [formula], we deduce that (0:Rtbk)  =  akRt  for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Hence λRt(Et)  ≥  3. Now, as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:dimain], we get that λR(E)  ≥  3.

When R is a reduced ring we have a more general result.

Let R be a reduced ring. Then R is self fp-injective if and only if R is a Von Neumann regular ring.

Proof. Only necessity requires a proof. Since R is reduced, R is a subring of S  =  ΠP∈MinSpec(R)Q(R / P), and S is a Von Neumann regular ring. Hence, for every r∈R, there exists s∈S such that r2s  =  r. But, since R  is self fp - injective, R is a pure submodule of S. Thus, there exists s'∈R such that r2s'  =  r.

Let R be an arithmetic ring of Krull dimension 0.

Then λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

Proof. For every M∈MaxSpec(R), any element of MRM is a zero divisor. From [\cite=Cou], we deduce that R is locally self fp - injective, and from [\cite=Cou] or [\cite=FaFa] that R is self fp - injective. The result is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=T:dinj].

Now, we give an example of a noncoherent Kaplansky ring R with Krull dimension 0, which is locally coherent.

The following proposition will be used to compute the λ-dimension of semi-local arithmetic rings and fractionnally self injective rings.

Let R be a valuation ring, M its maximal ideal, Z the subset of zero divisors of R. Then the following statements are true.

M is a flat module if and only if (0:r)  is not finitely generated for every [formula].

Let r and s in R such that [formula]. Then:

(0:rs)  =  ((0:r):s) and (0:r)  =  s(0:rs).

If [formula], (0:r)  is finitely generated if and only if (0:rs)  is also.

Proof.

Suppose that M is a flat module. Let [formula] and s∈(0:r). Let [formula] be the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map Rr  →  R. Then [formula]. From [\cite=Bou] we deduce that there exist t∈(0:r) and m∈M such that s  =  tm. Consequently [formula].

Conversely let s∈M and r∈R such that [formula]. If r∉Z then s = 0 and [formula]. If [formula], since (0:r) is not finitely generated, then there exist t∈(0:r) and m∈M such that s  =  tm. Hence [formula].

i) It is easy to get the first equality and the inclusion s(0:rs)  ⊆  (0:r). Now, if t∈(0:r), then t∈Rs since [formula]. We deduce that there exists c∈R such that t  =  cs and it is obvious that c∈(0:rs). Then ii) is a consequence of i).

Let R be a valuation ring, M its maximal ideal and Z the subset of its zero divisors. Then the following statements are true.

If Z  =  0 then R is coherent.

If [formula] and [formula], then λ-dim (R)  =  2.

If [formula] and Z  =  M, then λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

If R is a domain or a noncoherent ring then M is a flat ideal and for any R-module E with λR(E)  =    ∞  , flat-dim (E)  ≤  1.

Proof.

It is obvious.

We have [formula]. Since M is a direct limit of free modules, M is flat. Let E be a module such that λR(E)  ≥  2. Then we may assume that E = R / rR, where r∈R. Since M is flat, we deduce from Proposition [\ref=P:local] that r∉Z if [formula]. We get successively that flat-dim (R / rR)  ≤  1, λR(R / rR)  ≥  3 and λ-dim (R)  =  2.

Since Z  =  M, R is self fp-injective by [\cite=Cou]. By Theorem [\ref=T:dinj], λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

It remains to examine the case Z  =  M. Let r∈R such that λR(R / rR)  =    ∞  . If R is not coherent, then for every [formula], (0:s) is not finitely generated by Proposition [\ref=P:local](2). We deduce that M is flat and that r  =  0 or r is a unit. Hence R / rR is a free module.

Let R be a semi-local arithmetic ring. Then λ-dim (R)  ≤  2 and R is coherent if and only if R is locally coherent.

Proof. Since MaxSpec(R) is finite, S  =  ΠM∈MaxSpec(R)RM is a faithfully flat R-module. We deduce that λ-dim R  ≤  λ-dim S  =   sup {λ-dim RM|M∈MaxSpec(R)}.

Let R be an arithmetic ring. We suppose that RM is a domain or a noncoherent ring for every M∈MaxSpec(R). Then λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

Proof. Let E be an R-module with λR(E)  ≥  2. From Theorem [\ref=T:val], we deduce that flat-dim EM  ≤  1 for every M∈MaxSpec(R). Hence flat-dim E  ≤  1. We consider the following finite 2-presentation of E :

[formula]

Then ker(p) is a finitely presented flat R - module. We deduce successively that ker(p) , ker(u1) and ker(u2) are finitely generated projective R-modules. Hence λR(E)  ≥  3.

Let R be a valuation ring and A a nonzero proper ideal of R. Then the following statements are true.

If A is prime then R / A is coherent.

If A is finitely generated, then R / A is coherent and self fp-injective.

If A is not prime and not finitely generated then λ-dim (R / A)  =  2.

Proof.

It is obvious.

We have A  =  Ra for some a∈R. If r∉Ra, then there exists s∉Ra such that a  =  rs. Clearly Rs  ⊆  (Ra:r). Let c∈(Ra:r). If cr  =  0 then c∈Rs since [formula]. If [formula], then there exists d∈R such that cr  =  da = dsr. Hence r(c - ds)  =  0. If ds  =  vc for some v∈R, we get that rc(1 - v)  =  0. Since [formula], v is a unit and we obtain that c∈Rs, and (Ra:r)  =  Rs.

Since A is not prime, there exist s and [formula], such that sr∈A. Hence [formula] and we prove easily that (A:r) and (A:r) / A  are not finitely generated.

Let R be an arithmetic ring and A a finitely generated proper ideal of R such that (0:A)  ⊆  J(R), the Jacobson radical of R. Then R / A  is a coherent and self fp-injective ring.

Proof. Then, for every maximal ideal M of R, ARM is a nonzero finitely generated ideal of RM. By Corollary [\ref=C:valqu], RM / ARM is self fp-injective. We deduce that R / A is self fp-injective.

Since in every arithmetic ring the intersection of two finitely generated ideals is a finitely generated ideal, [\cite=ShWi], it is sufficient to prove that (A:b) is finitely generated for every [formula]. Let M be a maximal ideal of R. Then there exists a∈A such that ARM  =  aRM. Since A is finitely generated, there exists [formula] such that ARt  =  aRt. Now, if b∈aRM, then [formula] for some c∈R and [formula], and we get the equality t'sb  =  t'ca for some [formula]. We deduce that t's∈(A:b), and (ARtt's:Rtt'sb)  =  t's ~ Rtt's. If b∉aRM then there exist c∈R and s∉M such that [formula]. As in the proof of Corollary [\ref=C:valqu], (RMa:RMb)  =  RMc. For some [formula] we have t'sa  =  t'cb. We deduce that t'c∈(A:b) and (ARtt's:Rtt'sb)  =  t'cRtt's. Hence, for every M∈MaxSpec(R), we may assume that there exist [formula] and cM∈(A:b) such that (ARtM:RtMb)  =  cMRtM. A finite number of open subsets D(tM) cover MaxSpec(R). Let [formula] be these open subsets and [formula] such that (ARtk:Rtkb)  =  ckRtk, for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Then we get that {ck|1  ≤  k  ≤  n} generates (A:b).

Following Vámos [\cite=Vam], we say that R is a torch ring if the following conditions are satisfied :

R is an arithmetical ring with at least two maximal ideals.

R has a unique minimal prime ideal P which is a nonzero uniserial module.

We follow T.S. Shores and R. Wiegand [\cite=ShWi], by defining a canonical form for an R-module E to be a decomposition [formula] where [formula] and by calling a ring R a CF-ring if every direct sum of finitely many cyclic modules has a canonical form.

Let R be CF-ring. Then the following statements are true.

λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

R is coherent if and only if R is locally coherent.

Proof. In [\cite=ShWi] it is proved that every CF-ring is arithmetic and a finite product of indecomposable CF-rings. If R is indecomposable then R is either a domain (1), or a semi-local ring (2), or a torch ring (3). In the case (1) R is coherent, and the theorem is a consequence of Corollary [\ref=C:semilo] in the case (2). We may assume that R is a torch ring. Then, there is only one maximal ideal M such that [formula], and we have P2  =  0. For every maximal ideal [formula], RN  is a domain. Consequently, if RM is not coherent we deduce from Corollary [\ref=C:wdone] that λ-dim R  =  2. Now we assume that RM is coherent. As in the previous proposition it is sufficient to prove that (0:r) is finitely generated for any r∈R. Then we have (0:RMr)  =  sRM for some s∈R. Since the canonical homomorphism R  →  RM is monic, rs  =  0.

If r∉P, then s∈P. For every maximal ideal N of R, [formula], we have [formula] and sRN = 0. Consequently (0:r)N  =  0  =  sRN. We deduce that (0:r)  =  Rs.

If r∈P, then s∉P since P2  =  0. Since R satisfies the condition iii) of [\cite=ShWi], V(s) is a finite subset of MaxSpec(R). We denote V(s)  =  {M,Nk |1  ≤  k  ≤  n}. Since rRNk  =  0 then there exists sk∉Nk such that skr  =  0, for every k, 1  ≤  k  ≤  n. Let A be the ideal of R generated by {s,sk | 1  ≤  k  ≤  n}. Then for every maximal ideal [formula] we have AN  =  RN  =  (0:RNr)  =  (0:r)N. Hence we get that A  =  (0:r).

In [\cite=Vam] Vámos proved that every fractionnally self-injective ring (FSI-ring) is a CF-ring. Consequently the following corollary holds.

Let R be a fractionnally self-injective ring. Then the following statements are true.

λ-dim (R)  ≤  2.

R is coherent if and only if R is locally coherent.

Fractionnally self fp-injective rings

First we give a generalization of results obtained in [\cite=Vam] on fractionnally self-injective rings.

Let R be a fractionnally self fp - injective ring. Then the following statements are true.

R is an arithmetic ring.

For every proper ideal A of R, MinSpec(R / A) is a compact space. Moreover if A is semi-prime then R / A is semihereditary.

Proof.

It is the main result of [\cite=FaFa] (Theorem 1).

MinSpec(R / A) is homeomorphic to MinSpec(R / radA). We may assume that A is semi-prime. Then gl-w-dim (R / A)  ≤  1. By Theorem [\ref=T:redu], Q(R / A) is a Von Neumann regular ring. We deduce that R / A is semi-hereditary from [\cite=Endo] and that MinSpec(R / A) is compact from [\cite=Que].

Now we give a positive answer to a question proposed by M. Henriksen, [\cite=ShoWie]. The following theorem is a generalization of [\cite=LLS] and [\cite=ShoWie].

Every Bézout ring R with compact minimal prime spectrum is Hermite.

Proof Let a and b be in R. We may assume that [formula] and [formula]. Then there exist a',b',d, m and n in R such that a  =  da', b  =  db' and ma + nb = d. We denote c  =  ma' + nb', and N the nilradical of R. We have (1 - c)d  =  0. Since [formula] it follows that c∉N.

First we suppose that (N:c)  =  N. Let [formula], m' and n' be in R such that [formula], [formula] and m'a' + n'b' = d'. Then c∈Rd' and consequently (N:d')  =  N. Since [formula], [formula]. Hence [formula] is a unit and the following equalities hold : [formula], [formula] and [formula].

Now we suppose that (N:c)  ≠  N. Since MinSpec(R) is compact R'  =  R / N is a semi-hereditary ring. Denote [formula] for any r∈R. Then there exists an idempotent [formula] of R' such that [formula]. Since idempotents can be lifted modulo N, we may assume that e  =  e2. We deduce that (N:c)  =  R(1 - e) + N, and (1 - e)c∈N. Let P∈D(1 - e). Thus c∈P and (1 - c)∉P. Consequently D(1 - e)  ⊆  D(1 - c), and since (1 - e) is an idempotent, (1 - e)∈R(1 - c). But (1 - c)d  =  0 and therefore (1 - e)d  =  0 and ed  =  d. As in the proof of [\cite=LLS] we denote a1  =  a'e, b1  =  b'e  +  (1 - e), m1  =  me and n1  =  ne  +  (1 - e). Then we get a  =  a1d, b  =  b1d and m1a + n1b  =  d. Let c1  =  m1a1 + n1b1  =  ce  +  (1 - e) and r∈(N:c1). We get that r(1 - e)∈N and rec∈N. Hence re∈(N:c)  =  R(1 - e)  +  N. Consequently re∈N and (N:c1)  =  N. From the previous part of the proof we deduce that R is Hermite.

Let R be a Bézout ring of Krull dimension at most one.

If MinSpec(R) is compact then R is a Kaplansky ring.

Proof. Let N be the nilradical of R. By [\cite=Sho], R / N is a Kaplansky ring. From the previous theorem and [\cite=Hen], the result follows.

Let R be a fractionnally self fp-injective ring . If R is a Bézout ring then R is a Kaplansky ring.

Proof.. By Theorem [\ref=T:frac] and Theorem [\ref=T:H] R is Hermite. Hence by [\cite=GiHe2], it is sufficient to prove that for all a, b, c∈R such that Ra + Rb + Rc = R there exist p and q∈R such that Rpa + R(pb + qc) = R. We put

[formula]

By using the same terminology as in [\cite=LLS] let E be an R-module named by A. It is easy to check that E is an R / Rac-module. Let J = rad(Rac). It follows that [formula] is semihereditary by Theorem [\ref=T:frac]. Thus [formula] is named by

[formula]

Since [formula] is Hermite and [formula] we show, as in the proof of [\cite=Sho], that there exist two invertible matrices P and Q and a diagonal matrix D with entries in [formula] such that [formula]. We put

[formula]

By [\cite=LLS] we may assume that [formula] divides [formula]. The equality [formula] implies that [formula]. It follows that [formula] is a unit. Hence [formula] is a cyclic [formula]-module. By Nakayama Lemma it follows that E is cyclic over R / Rac. Hence E is cyclic over R too. Now we do as at the end of the proof of [\cite=LLS] to conclude.

By [\cite=FaFa] every arithmetic ring of Krull dimension zero is fractionnally self fp-injective. By Theorem [\ref=T:fracka] every Bézout ring of Krull dimension zero is Kaplansky. However it is possible to prove a more general result.

Let R be an arithmetic ring of Krull dimension 0. Then R is a Kaplansky ring and an adequate ring.

Proof First we prove that R is Hermite. Let a and b be in R. We denote U  =  {M∈Spec(R)|aRM  ⊆  bRM} and [formula]. Recall that Spec(R) is a (totally disconnected) Haussdorf compact space, where D(A) is open and closed, for every finitely generated ideal A of R. Let M∈U. Then there exist c∈R and [formula] such that [formula]. We deduce that there exists [formula] such that s(ta - cb) = 0. Hence, for every Q∈D(st), RQa  ⊆  RQb. Consequently U is open and F is closed. Now, let M∈F. Then bRM  ⊂  aRM and there exists [formula] such that bRQ  ⊆  aRQ, for every Q∈D(t). If we denote WM  =  D(t), then [formula]. Since F is compact, F is contained in a finite union W of these open and closed subsets of Spec(R). Consequently, there exists an idempotent e of R such that F  ⊆  W  =  D(e) and D(1 - e)  ⊆  U. Since RMb  ⊆  RMa for every M∈D(e), there exists r∈R such that be  =  rae. There also exists s∈R such that a(1 - e)  =  sb(1 - e). Now if we take d  =  ae + b(1 - e), a'  =  s(1 - e)  +  e, b'  =  (1 - e)  +  re, then a  =  da', b  =  db' and ea'  +  (1 - e)b'  =  1.

Now we prove that R is adequate. Let a and b be in R, [formula]. There exists an idempotent e in R such that D(b)  =  D(e). If we take r  =  (1 - e) + ae and s  =  a(1 - e) + e, then a  =  rs and Rr + Rb  =  R. Let s' be a nonunit in R that divides s. Then V(s')  ⊆  V(b). Hence [formula]. From [\cite=GiHe2] we deduce that R is a Kaplansky ring.

The following proposition gives an answer to a question of [\cite=LLS].

Let R be an arithmetic ring and J(R) its Jacobson radical. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

R has a unique minimal prime ideal

For every d∉J(R), (0:d)  ⊆  J(R)

Proof. The implication 1  ⇒  2 is easy.

2  ⇒  1. Suppose there are at least two minimal prime ideals I and J. Let [formula] and P a maximal ideal containing I. Then IRP is the nilradical of RP. It follows that there exist [formula] and a positive integer n such that san = 0. Then [formula]. Let Q be a maximal ideal containing J. There also exist [formula] and a positive integer m such that tsm = 0. Since t∉J(R), sm∈(0:t)  ⊆  J(R). But s∉P implies that sm∉J(R). Hence we get a contradiction.
