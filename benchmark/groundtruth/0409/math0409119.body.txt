Invariant Subspaces of RL1

Let [formula] denote the unit circle in the complex plane, and let Lp denote the Lebesgue spaces on [formula] with respect to Lebesgue measure normalized so that the Lebesgue measure of [formula] is 1. We use the standard notation Hp to denote the subspace of Lp consisting of those functions in Lp whose negative Fourier coefficients vanish. Let

[formula]

An invariant subspace is a (closed) subspace invariant under multiplication by the coordinate function. D. Singh and A. A. W. Mehanna [\cite=S-M] gave a characterization of the invariant subspaces of RH1. Specifically, they proved the following result.

Let

[formula]

A simply invariant subspace is an invariant subspace, M, whose image under multiplication by the coordinate function is strictly contained in M. (In RH1 every invariant subspace is simply invariant.) In this note we extend Singh and Mehanna's result to the simply invariant subspaces of RL1.

To prove this theorem we follow the approach of Singh and Mehanna. We will first prove an analogous result in RL2 and then use this result to prove the Main Theorem. Singh and Mehanna's proof weighs heavily on the inner-outer factorization of functions in H1. In general, L1 functions do not have such a factorization. As we will soon see, however, the members of M have a nice factorization which will prove useful in the proof of the Main Theorem.

Let M be a simply invariant subspace of RL2. Then there exists a unique (up to a constant multiple of modulus one) unimodular function, U, in RL2 such that M  =  U  RH2.

To prove this, we need to understand the form of the doubly invariant subspaces of RL2. These are the invariant subspaces, M, of RL2 for which multiplication by the coordinate function takes M onto M.

If M is a doubly invariant subspace of RL2 then [formula] where E is a measurable subset of [formula].

In the above theorem, [formula] denotes the characteristic function of the set E. The following proof is a slightly simplified version of the proof given in [\cite=He] for the doubly invariant subspaces of L2. Although our proof is stated for RL2, it works equally well in the L2 setting.

If 1 is in M then M = RL2. In this case [formula]. If 1 is not in M, let q be the orthogonal projection of 1 onto M. Then 1 - q is orthogonal to M and, in particular, 1 - q is orthogonal to einθq, for all integers n. That is,

[formula]

Therefore, q = |q|2 (a.e.) on [formula], and thus q takes only values zero and one. Let E be the subset of [formula] where q takes the value one. Then [formula] and [formula], so we have that [formula] and [formula]. By the double invariance of M we have that [formula] is contained in M and that [formula] is contained in [formula]. We also have [formula] and [formula]. Hence [formula] as desired.

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=t:1]. Our proof follows the proof given in [\cite=He] for the simply invariant subspaces of L2. We include it for completeness.

Since M is simply invariant there exists a U in [formula] of norm one. U is orthogonal to einθU for all natural numbers [formula]. So by the symmetry of the inner product on RL2 we get

[formula]

Thus U has constant modulus one. The set {einθU}∞n =  -   ∞ spans a doubly invariant subspace in RL2. Since U does not vanish on a set of positive measure, we have that this doubly invariant subspace is RL2. The span of {einθU}n  ≥  0 is U  RH2 and is contained in M. If we show that the set {einθU}n  <  0 is contained in [formula], then we can conclude that U  RH2 is all of M. Showing that the set {einθU}n < 0 is contained in [formula] is the same as showing that U is orthogonal to einθM for all natural numbers n > 0. This is true by our choice of U. Hence, M  =  U  RH2 as desired. It remains to prove the uniqueness of U. If I is another unimodular function such that M = I  RH2, then we have U / I  RH2  =  RH2. Since the inverse of a unimodular function is its complex conjugate, we have that both [formula] and [formula] are in RH2. This implies that U / I is a constant of modulus one.

Let M be a simply invariant subspace of RL1. Then M is a subset of L1. The complexification of M, [formula] is then a simply invariant subspace of L1. By a classical result [\cite=He], [formula], where ψ is a unimodular function in L1. So M is contained in ψH1. It follows that every element of M has a unique unimodular-outer factorization.

Before we prove the Main Theorem we prove several technical lemmas. Let f be an element of L1. Define [formula].

For f in L1, [formula].

Let f be an element of L1. Then

[formula]

For f in L1, f is in RL1 if and only if f = f*.

If O is outer then O* is outer.

Recall that a function f in Hp is outer if and only if

[formula]

Since O is outer we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=l:1], |O(0)| = |O*(0)| and the negative Fourier coefficients of O* are zero. A change of variable shows that

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

so O* is outer.

Let f be an element of RL1 such that f has a unique factorization f = UO, where U is a unimodular function and O is an outer function. Then U and O are in RL1.

Since f is in RL1, by the above corollary we have that f = f*. Thus UO = U*O*. Since U* is unimodular and O* is outer, the uniqueness of our factorization implies U* = U and O* = O. By the above corollary we get U and O are in RL1.

We are now ready to prove the Main Theorem.

Let M be a simply invariant subspace of RL1. Then [formula] is an invariant (closed) subspace of RL2. We will show that [formula] is dense in M. Then [formula] is actually simply invariant, and by Theorem [\ref=t:1] [formula]. Hence M is of the form U  RH1, as desired.

We first show that [formula] is nonempty. Let f be any nonzero element of M. By Lemma [\ref=l:2] we have that f = UO, where U is unimodular and O is outer, with both U and O in RL1. Since O is outer it is actually a member of RH1, so by Lemma 3.4 of [\cite=S-M] we may assume without loss of generality that [formula] is in RH2. Therefore [formula] is in RL2. We now show that g is also in M. By Corollary 3.4 of [\cite=S-M] there exists a sequence of polynomials, {pn}, in RH2 such that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Since fpn is in M for all n by the invariance of M, and since M is closed, we see that g is in M, as desired.

It remains to show that [formula] is dense in M. Let f be any nonzero element of M. Then f = UO, where U is unimodular and O is outer, with both U and O in RL1. As mentioned above, we assume without loss of generality that [formula] is in RH2. Let [formula] be the partial sums of the Fourier series for [formula]. We know that [formula] converges to [formula] in RL2. By the work above we know that [formula] is in [formula]. By the invariance of [formula] we have that [formula] is in [formula] for all n > 0. Thus

[formula]

We conclude that [formula] is dense in M, as desired.
