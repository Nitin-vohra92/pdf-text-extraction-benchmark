The vector coupling in IR region from splittings in bottomonium

1. The static potential plays a special role in heavy quarkonia physics. Although Vst(r) was introduced by the Cornell group 30 years ago [\cite=1], even now we do not fully understand some important features of static interaction in QCD, moreover uncertainties refer both to perturbative (P) and nonperturbative (NP) contributions to Vst(r). There are three characteristic features of static potentials, widely used in QCD phenomenology: 1.additivity, when Vst(r) is taken as a sum of confining and the gluon-exchange terms:

[formula]

2.linear behavior of VNP(r)  =  σr over the whole region of Q separations r; 3.constant value of the vector coupling αV(r) at large r [\cite=2] [\cite=3]. (By definition [formula]). In some cases αV(r) = const. is taken already at not large [formula] fm), as in lattice QCD [\cite=4], or even at any separations r as in the Cornell potential [\cite=5]. Last assumption can be justified only if the "true" vector coupling freezes at rather small r, while asymptotic freedom behavior is supposed to be inessential in first approximation, as for high excitations in charmonium.

Although for long time "the freezing" of αV(r) is widely used in QCD phenomenology, nevertheless, till now there is no consensus about the true value of freezing (or critical) constant αcr. In different approaches the values of αcr vary from αcr(lat)  ≈  0.23  ÷  0.30 in lattice QCD [\cite=4], the values 0.39-0.45 for the Cornell potential [\cite=5] up to the number αcrit  ≈  0.60 in background perturbation theory (BPT) [\cite=3] [\cite=6] and also in the famous paper [\cite=2]. Even larger values, [formula], were determined from the hadronic decays of the τ-lepton [\cite=7] and in analytical perturbation theory (APT) [\cite=8], where [formula].

Some achievements in our understanding of static interaction on the fundamental level mostly refer to NP term. In particular, the property of additivity has been confirmed by lattice calculations of static potentials in different group representations where the behavior Vst(r,N)  =  CFṽst (universal) [formula] fm), or the Casimir scaling property, has been observed in [\cite=9], and in Ref. [\cite=10] theoretical interpretation of the Casimir scaling has been given.

With the use of the vacuum correlators, measured on the lattice [\cite=11], it was shown that linear behavior of VNP(r) takes place only in the range [formula] [\cite=12]. Here Tg  ≈  0.2 fm is the gluonic correlation length [\cite=11], while RSB  ≈  1.2 fm characterizes those separations r > RSB, where the string breaking is essential [\cite=13] [\cite=14] and linear potential is becoming more flat. Such flattening of confining potential does not affect the positions of the b levels, which lie below B threshold, but this effect is essential for the states of large size : [formula] fm. In particular, in light meson sector this effect provides a correlated large shift (down) of radial excitations like ρ(3S),ρ(4S),aJ(2P) [\cite=14].

At present there is no theory of string breaking and also we do not know precise behavior of VNP(r) at small r. Meanwhile, knowledge of VNP(r) at small r is very important: ([\ref=1]) for understanding of fine structure splittings of χb mesons (through the Thomas precession term) [\cite=15]; ([\ref=2]) for explanation of very small shift of hc(11P1) with respect to Mcog(13PJ) in charmonium, where a cancellation of two small terms-negative P term and positive NP term takes place [\cite=16].

Here we concentrate on the gluon-exchancge term. A unique information about the vector coupling αV(r) can be extracted from the analysis of the splittings between high excitations (still lying below B threshold) in bottomonium. There are several reasons for that. First, the splittings between b levels are known from experiment with precision accuracy, [formula] MeV. Second, there are ten observed (plus unobserved 1F,2D,3D, and may be 3P) states which lie below B threshold. These states have very different r.m.s. radii, which spread from 0.2 fm for Υ(1S) up to 0.8 fm for 2D and 3P states (see Table 1).

In our analysis of the b spectrum we use [formula]   where the vector coupling αB(r) is defined as in BPT [\cite=3] [\cite=6],

[formula]

while the background coupling in momentum space is given by the standard formula:

[formula]

with the modification of the logarithm:

[formula]

where [formula] is so called background mass, defined by the lowest hybrid excitation and expressed through the string tension [\cite=3]. The QCD constant ΛV is expressed through the conventional [formula] [\cite=18]:

[formula]

The important feature of the background coupling αB(q) (and also αB(r)) is that it has correct perturbative limit at large q2 (small r). Therefore in BPT there are no additional (fitting) parameters and the b spectrum and the wave functions are fully defined by the QCD constant [formula] and the string tension (in BPT the pole mass of a heavy quark coincides with the conventional value [\cite=18]).

Due to the r-dependence of αB(r) every b state has its own characteristic coupling, denoted as αeff(nL), which can be defined as

[formula]

Their values are smaller by (20  ÷  30)% than the freezing value αcr  =  αB(q2 = 0) and grow for higher excitations (see Table 2).

The picture is different for the Cornell potential where αV(r) = const  ≈  0.4 for all b states [\cite=5].

It is convenient to consider the splittings between the spin-averaged masses Mcog(nL) (instead of the absolute masses), in this way minimizing dependence of the splittings on the choice of parameters present in Vst(r). It appears that the splittings 1D - 1P,1F - 1P,2D - 2P do not practically depend on kinematics, see Table 3, where the solutions for relativistic Spinless Salpeter Equation (SSE) are compared to those for Schroedinger eq. From Table 3 one can also see that other splittings (like 2S-1P, 2P-1P) in NR case turn out to be by 6-10 MeV larger and this difference is much larger than the experimental error in a splitting, δM  ~  1 MeV.

a) The potential VB(r) in BPT is taken with σ  =  0.178 GeV2, MB = 0.95 GeV, ΛV(2-loop, nf = 5) = 330 MeV, or [formula]-loop, nf = 5) = 242 MeV.

Our calculations show that the splittings 1D - 1P,1F - 1P, and 2D - 2P do not practically depend on the variation of the quark pole mass, kinematics and weakly depend on the variation of the string tension. In [\cite=6] it has been shown that only the value of σ = 0.177(3) GeV2 provides good description of bottomonium spectrum as a whole. However these splittings appear to be very sensitive to the freezing value αcr or to the QCD constant Λ.

This statement is illustrated by the numbers presented in Table 4 for three values of ΛV(nf = 5) = 300 MeV, 320 MeV, and 330 MeV which correspond to two-loop [formula] MeV, 234 MeV, and 242 MeV, respectively.

From Table 4 it is clear that the splitting Δ = Mcog(1D) - Mcog(1P) turns out to be in good agreement with the experimental number, Δ( exp ) = 261.1  ±  2.2( exp )+ 1- 0(th) MeV only for large value of the QCD constant [formula]-loop) (experimental number for M(13D2) = 10161.1  ±  2.2. MeV is taken from [\cite=19]). For Λ(5)V(2-loop)≈  335 MeV the critical value of αB(r) is large, αcr = 0.60  ±  0.01 and corresponding [formula]-loop)≈  240  ÷  245 MeV gives rise to αs(MZ) = 0.1193(2).

From this analysis we can predict 1F - 1P,2D - 2P splittings (or the masses of 1F and 2D states) taking the same Λ(5)V as for the 1D state. It gives

[formula]

[formula]

Since fine structure splittings of the 13FJ,23DJ multiplets should be very small, as well as for 13DJ states [\cite=20], one can expect that the masses M(13FJ) and M(23DJ) have to be very close to the figures given in ([\ref=6]). Therefore the observation of the 1F,2D states would be crucially important for the better understanding of the gluon-exchange term on the fundamental level.
