Introduction

In 1978, Cuntz introduced a generalisation of Murray-von Neumann comparison: given positive elements a and b in a C*-algebra A, write [formula] if there is a sequence (vi)∞i = 1 in A such that

[formula]

([\cite=Cu1]). We say that a is Cuntz subequivalent to b. The relation ~   given by

[formula]

is an equivalence relation known as Cuntz equivalence. If A is unital, then one can mimic the construction of the ordered semigroup V(A) of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections in matrices over A by substituting positive elements for projections and Cuntz equivalence for Murray-von Neumann equivalence. This yields a positively ordered Abelian monoid W(A) called the Cuntz semigroup of A, and its partially ordered Grothendieck envelope [formula]. If A is stably finite, then each tracial state on A gives rise to an order preserving state on W(A). If the partial order on W(A) is determined by these states, then A is said to have strict comparison of positive elements, or simply strict comparison.

The study of the Cuntz semigroup has been resurgent of late. Rørdam has proved that simple, unital, exact, and finite C*-algebras which absorb the Jiang-Su algebra tensorially have strict comparsion ([\cite=R4]), whence, by results of W. Winter and the author, this last property is enjoyed by all classes of simple, separable, and nuclear C*-algebras currently known to satisfy Elliott's classification conjecture ([\cite=TW1],[\cite=TW2]). Coward, Elliott, and Ivanescu have recently identified a category of partially ordered semigroups into which the Cuntz semigroup is a continuous functor with respect to inductive limits. Significantly, the Cuntz semigroup is deeply connected to the classification programme for separable and nuclear C*-algebras: such algebras cannot be classified by their [formula]-theory in the absence of strict comparison ([\cite=To2]), and there is some evidence that the converse will hold ([\cite=TW3]). Brown, Perera, and the author recently proved a structure theorem for the Cuntz semigroup which applies to most of our stock-in-trade simple, separable, and nuclear C*-algebras ([\cite=BPT], [\cite=PT]).

In this paper we study the structure of the Cuntz semigroup for commutative and approximately homogeneous (AH) C*-algebras. Our main result is a positive answer to the following question, raised in [\cite=To3]: This question asks for an analogue in positive elements of the following well known stability theorem for vector bundles.

Our positive answer to Question [\ref=mainq] has several applications to AH algebras. Recall that an AH algebra is an inductive limit C*-algebra A =  lim i  →    ∞(Ai,φi), where

[formula]

for compact connected Hausdorff spaces Xi,l, projections [formula], and natural numbers ni. If A is separable, then one may assume that the Xi,l are finite CW-complexes ([\cite=Bl2], [\cite=Go1]). The algebras Ai are called semi-homogeneous, and the inductive system (Ai,φi) is referred to as a decomposition for A. All AH algebras in this paper are assumed to be separable.

If an AH algebra A admits a decompostion as in ([\ref=decomp]) for which

[formula]

then we say that A has slow dimension growth. Let [formula] denote the class of simple, unital, and infinite-dimensional AH algebras with slow dimension growth. [formula] was studied intensively during the early- to mid-1990s by Blackadar, Bratteli, Ddrlat, Elliott, Gong, Kumjian, Li, Rørdam, Thomsen, and others (see [\cite=BBEK], [\cite=BDR], [\cite=BE], [\cite=DNNP], [\cite=D], [\cite=EG], [\cite=EGL2], [\cite=EGL], and [\cite=G2]). The crowning achievement of this study was the confirmation of Elliott's classification conjecture for [formula] under the additional assumption of real rank zero ([\cite=D], [\cite=EG], [\cite=G2]), and the same confirmation in the real rank one case under the stronger hypothesis of very slow dimension growth for A ([\cite=EGL]):

[formula]

This strengthened hypothesis is thought by experts to be unneccessary, but there has been no progress on this problem. In fact, there has been no progress on the basic structure of elements of [formula] since the late 1990s.

In this paper we obtain significant new results on the structure slow dimension growth AH algebras. We use our positive answer to Question [\ref=mainq] to prove that if A∈, then A has strict comparison of positive elements. There is evidence that this powerful [formula]-theoretic condition will characterise those simple, separable, and nuclear C*-algebras which are amenable to [formula]-theoretic classification -- it already does so for a class of AH algebras intersecting substantially with [formula] ([\cite=TW3]) -- and so our result supports the belief that [formula] will satisfy the Elliott conjecture without the assumption of very slow dimension growth. By appealing to our recent work with Brown and Perera ([\cite=BPT]), we confirm several conjectures pertaining to the structure of the Cuntz semigroup for A∈. First, W(A) is recovered functorially from the Elliott invariant of A, allowing one to attack the Elliott conjecture for [formula] with considerably more information than would appear to be contained in the Elliott invariant alone. (This functorial recovery was conjectured for a class of algebras containing [formula] by Perera and the author in [\cite=PT].) Second, the states on W(A) coming from traces on A are weak-*   dense in the state space of W(A). Third, the state space of W(A) is a Choquet simplex. The results concerning the state space of W(A) were conjectured by Blackadar and Handelman in 1982 ([\cite=BH]), but were only known to hold for commutative C*-algebras at the time.

In a separate paper we will apply our positive answer to Question [\ref=mainq] to answer, affirmatively, a question of N. C. Phillips: "Do there exist simple, separable, nuclear, and non-Z-stable C*-algebras which agree on the Elliott invariant, yet are not isomorphic?" (See [\cite=To4].)

Our paper is orgainsed as follows: Section [\ref=prelim] contains the definition of the Cuntz semigroup and recalls some essential facts about Cuntz subequivalence; Section [\ref=stab] contains the stability theorems which answer Question [\ref=mainq]; in Section [\ref=ah] we establish results (i)-(iv) of the abstract.

Preliminaries

Let A be a C*-algebra, and let [formula] denote the n  ×  n matrices whose entries are elements of A. If [formula], then we simply write [formula]. Let [formula] denote the algebraic limit of the direct system [formula], where [formula] is given by

[formula]

Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) denote the positive elements in [formula] (resp. [formula]). Given [formula], we say that a is Cuntz subequivalent to b (written [formula]) if there is a sequence (vn)∞n = 1 of elements of [formula] such that

[formula]

We say that a and b are Cuntz equivalent (written a  ~  b) if [formula] and [formula]. This relation is an equivalence relation, and we write 〈a〉 for the equivalence class of a. The set

[formula]

becomes a positively ordered Abelian monoid when equipped with the operation

[formula]

and the partial order

[formula]

In the sequel, we refer to this object as the Cuntz semigroup of A. The Grothendieck enveloping group of W(A) is denoted [formula].

Given [formula] and ε  >  0, we denote by (a - ε)+ the element of C*(a) corresponding (via the functional calculus) to the function

[formula]

(Here σ(a) denotes the spectrum of a.) The proposition below collects some facts about Cuntz subequivalence due to Kirchberg and Rørdam.

Now suppose that A is unital and stably finite, and denote by [formula] the space of normalised 2-quasitraces on A (v. [\cite=BH]). Let S(W(A)) denote the set of additive and order preserving maps s from W(A) to [formula] having the property that s(〈1A〉)  =  1. Such maps are called states. Given [formula], one may define a map [formula] by

[formula]

This map is lower semicontinous, and depends only on the Cuntz equivalence class of a. It moreover has the following properties:

if [formula], then sτ(a)  ≤  sτ(b);

if a and b are mutually orthogonal, then sτ(a + b)  =  sτ(a) + sτ(b);

[formula] as ε  →  0.

Thus, sτ defines a state on W(A). Such states are called lower semicontinuous dimension functions, and the set of them is denoted [formula]. [formula] is a simplex ([\cite=BH]), and the map from [formula] to [formula] defined by ([\ref=ldf]) is bijective and affine ([\cite=BH]). A dimension function on A is a state on [formula], assuming that the latter has been equipped with the usual order coming from the Grothendieck map. The set of dimension functions is denoted [formula]. [formula] is a (generally proper) face of [formula]. If A has the property that [formula] whenever s(a)  <  s(b) for every [formula], then we say that A has strict comparison of positive elements.

A stability theorem for [formula]

Strategy

In this section we provide a positive answer to Question [\ref=mainq]. The proof is long and proceeds in several steps, so an overview of our strategy is in order. We first generalise the concept of a trivial vector bundle by introducing trivial positive elements in matrices over a commutative C*-algebra, and prove that our question need only be answered in the case that X is a finite simplicial complex (Proposition [\ref=reduce]). For a finite simplicial complex X, we prove that any positive element in [formula] can be approximated in norm from below by a particularly tractable kind of positive element (Theorem [\ref=wellsupapprox]). Such an approximant is then shown to be dominated (in the sense of Cuntz comparison) by a trivial element whose rank over each point of X exceeds the rank of the approximant by an amount no greater than some fixed multiple of the dimension of X (Theorem [\ref=trivmajor]). Finally, we prove that any positive element dominates a trivial element provided that the rank of the given element exceeds the rank of the trivial element by [formula] over every point in X (Theorem [\ref=trivminor]). Combining the last two theorems yields a positive answer to Question [\ref=mainq].

Notation and background

Let X be a topological space. By an upper (resp. lower) semicontinuous function [formula] we will mean a function such that for every vector [formula], the real-valued function

[formula]

is upper (resp. lower) semicontinuous (cf. [\cite=BE]). The following result of Bratteli and Elliott, based on earlier work of Ddrlat, Nagy, Némethi, and Pasnicu ([\cite=DNNP]), will be used extensively in the sequel.

For a natural number [formula], let θl denote the trivial vector bundle of complex fibre dimension l. In a metric space X we will use the notation Br(x) for the open ball of radius r > 0 about x∈X. The following well known theorem is a direct consequence of [\cite=H].

Let Γn(X) denote the set of n-multisets (sets of n elements, allowing multiplicity) whose entries are elements of a metric space X. Equip Γn(X) with the following metric: for A,B∈Γn, let P denote the set of all possible pairings of the elements of A with the elements of B; for P∈P, let Δ(P) denote the maximum distance between two paired elements in P; set [formula].

Trivial positive elements

Clearly, if a above is a projection, then it is trivial in the sense we have defined if and only if it corresponds to a trivial vector bundle. When there is no danger of confusion, we will omit the second subscript for the sets Gi,a, Fi,a, and Hi,a.

The following lemma was observed in [\cite=Pe1]. The proof is an easy exercise.

An important analogy between trivial positive elements and trivial vector bundles is the fact that Cuntz comparison for trivial positive elements is encoded by rank functions.

If [formula], then [formula] for every x in X. It follows from Lemma [\ref=matrixcomp] that

[formula]

Now suppose that the rank inequality above holds. Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) be the rank values taken by a (resp. b). By assumption there exist projections [formula] and [formula] in some [formula], each corresponding to a trivial line bundle, and positive continuous functions

[formula]

and

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

The projections pi and qi are Murray-von Neumann equivalent for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  ns, as are their complements inside [formula]. It follows that there is a unitary U1 in [formula] such that u1q1u1  *    =  p1. We can repeat this argument to find a unitary u2 in [formula] such that u2q2u2  *    =  p2. Then [formula] is a unitary in [formula] such that U2qiU*2  =  pi for i  =  1,2. Iterating this process we arrive at a unitary U in [formula] such that

[formula]

Our rank inequality implies that

[formula]

whence gi,api is in the hereditary subalgebra of [formula] generated by gi,bpi. It follows that

[formula]

is in the hereditary subalgebra of [formula] generated by

[formula]

and that [formula], as desired.

Reduction to finite simplicial complexes

Let a, b, and K > 0 be as in the hypotheses of the theorem. Let there be given a compact metric space Z, and positive elements [formula] such that

[formula]

(This implies, in particular, that Z has finite covering dimension, but Theorem [\ref=main] holds vacuously if [formula]; there is no loss of generality here.)

A central theorem in the dimension theory of topological spaces asserts that if Z is a compact metric space of finite covering dimension, then Z is the limit of an inverse system (Yi,πi,j), where each Yi is a finite simplicial complex of dimension less than or equal to the dimension of Z (cf. [\cite=E]). Thus, we have an inductive limit decomposition for [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] is induced by πi,i + 1:Yi + 1  →  Yi.

We claim that for each ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that

[formula]

Notice that if ε1  ≤  ε2, then [formula]. Let ε > 0 be given, and fix z∈Z. Put [formula] and [formula] for convenience. Let η(z) denote the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of a(z). For the purpose of proving our claim, we view a and b as being contained in some [formula]. The map

[formula]

which assigns to an ordered pair (d,x) the multiset whose elements are the eigenvalues of d(x) is continuous in both variables, and so there is a neighbourhood V(z) of z upon which a has precisely A eigenvalues greater than or equal to [formula]. It follows from the functional calculus that [formula] is less than or equal to A on V(z). [formula] is continuous, and so there is a neighbourhood U(z) of z upon which b has at least B non-zero eigenvalues. In fact, more is true: U(z) may be chosen so that there is a continuous choice of B non-zero eigenvalues of b on U(z) which coincides with the spectrum of b(z) at z. Let δz be half the smallest eigenvalue occuring in this continous choice of eigenvalues. Then, [formula] on U(z), and this remains true if δz is replaced by some smaller δ'. Put [formula]. Then,

[formula]

Z is compact, so we may find [formula] such that

[formula]

Put [formula], and let x∈Z be given. Then x∈W(zl) for some 1  ≤  l  ≤  k, and applying the preceding inequality we have

[formula]

This proves the claim.

Given η > 0 and [formula] one can always find an element ã satisfying:

[formula];

[formula];

ã is in the image of φi,  ∞ for some [formula].

(This follows from Proposition [\ref=basics] and the inductive limit decomposition of [formula].) Let ε > 0 be given, and find δ > 0 so that

[formula]

Find an approximant [formula] for b satisfying (i)-(iii) above with η  =  δ. Similarly, find an approximant ã for (a - ε / 2)+ with η  =  ε / 2. Then, [formula],

[formula]

We may assume that both ã and [formula] are the images under φi,  ∞ of elements â and [formula] in [formula], respectively. These pre-images satisfy

[formula]

where πi,  ∞:Z  →  Yi is the continuous map which induces φi,  ∞. We cannot apply the hypothesis of the proposition unless the inequality above holds for all y∈Yi, and so we modify the pre-image [formula]. We may, as before, view â and [formula] as lying in some [formula]. Choose a continuous function f:Yi  →  [0,1] supported on the complement of [formula]. Put

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] agree on [formula], we have that φi,  ∞()  =  . But clearly

[formula]

whence [formula] by our hypothesis. Cuntz subequivalence is preserved under *  -homomorphisms, whence [formula]. Now

[formula]

ε was arbitrary, and the proposition follows.

Well supported approximants

We first define a precursor [formula] to Y, whose definition we later refine to obtain Y proper. By assumption, [formula]. Since U and Vc are compact, there is a δ  >  0 such that

[formula]

Refine the simplicial structure on X through repeated barycentric subdivision until the largest diameter of any simplex is less than δ / 2. Let [formula] be the subcomplex consisting of all simplices whose intersection with Vc is nonempty. The distance from any point in [formula] to Vc is at most δ / 2, and so [formula]. Every x∈Vc is contained in some simplex of X, so [formula].

Now choose [formula], and let Θx be the smallest simplex of the refined simplicial structure on X containing x. Suppose that Θx is not contained in [formula]. Then, Θx contains a point [formula], and there is an open set [formula] such that y∈U. Thus, there is a point y'∈U which is in the (relative) interior of Θx, and the smallest simplex of X containing y' is Θx. This implies that Θx is contained in [formula] by construction, contradicting x∈Θx. We conclude that [formula]. Now

[formula]

and so the second containment above is in fact equality. We conclude that [formula] is a subcomplex of X. [formula] is open, whence [formula] is the closure of its interior.

Notice that [formula] is defined in the same manner as Y: for each point in a given open set, one finds the smallest simplex containing the said point, and then takes the union of these simplices over all points in the open set. We may therefore define

[formula]

and apply the arguments above to conclude that Y is a subcomplex. Y both contains V and is contained in [formula], and so satisfies conclusions (i) and (ii) of the Lemma; Y satisfies conclusion (iii) by construction. Repeating the arguments above one last time, we find that [formula] and hence ∂Yc  =  ∂Y are subcomplexes.

Let [formula], and let Hi be the set Hi,a of Definition [\ref=trivial]. Let ε  >  0 be given.

Step 1. We will show that there exist open sets Vi  ⊇  Hi, 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and an upper semicontinuous function [formula] satisfying:

g(x)  =  a(x), [formula];

g(x) is continuous on [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  k;

||g(x) - a(x)||  <  ε, [formula];

[formula], [formula];

with [formula], there is a continuous projection-valued function [formula] such that

[formula]

and pi(x)  ≤  pj(x) whenever [formula] and i  ≤  j.

Moreover, upon refining the simplicial structure of X, we may assume that both Vi and [formula] are subcomplexes of X.

Let [formula] be the rank values taken by a. The function which assigns to each point x∈∂H1 the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of a(x) is continuous on a compact set, and so achieves a minimum, say η1  >  0. For each x∈∂H1, find δx  >  0 such that for every y∈Bδx(x) one has that the eigenvalues of a(y) are all either greater than

[formula]

or less than

[formula]

Let Ux be the connected component of Bδx(x) containing x. Put

[formula]

W1 is open. Use Lemma [\ref=cellapprox] to find a subcomplex Y1 of X such that [formula] and [formula]. Put V1  =  Yc1, and note that V1 so defined is a subcomplex of some (possibly refined) simplicial structure on X. Define p1(x) to be the support projection of a(x) for x∈H1, and the support projection of the eigenvectors of a(x) corresponding to eigenvalues which are greater than or equal to Lu1 for [formula]. For each x∈V1, put g(x)  =  p1(x)a(x).

Claim:

g(x)  =  a(x), [formula];

g(x) is continuous on V1;

||g(x) - a(x)||  <  ε, [formula];

[formula], [formula];

p1 is a continuous projection valued function on [formula] such that

[formula]

(i) is clear from the definition of g on H1.

For (ii), let xn  →  x in V1. If x is an interior point of H1, then g(xn)  →  g(x) since a is continuous and g  =  a on H1. Otherwise, x∈V1 is an interior point of some Uy, and we may find [formula] such that xn∈Uy, [formula]. It will thus suffice to prove that g(x) is continuous on Uy, y∈∂H1. Let σ(a(x)) denote the spectrum of a at the point x∈X. The map s:X  →  Γn given by s(x)  =  σ(a(x)) is continuous. Thus, s(xn)  →  s(x). In particular, the submultiset of s(xn) corresponding to elements larger than Lu1 converges to the similar submultiset of s(x); the eigenvectors of a(xn) corresponding to p1(xn) converge to the eigenvectors if a(x) corresponding to p(x), and so g(xn)  →  g(x), as required.

(iii) follows from the functional calculus and the definition of g -- a(x) - g(x) is zero if x∈H1, and is equal, in the functional calculus, to h(t) = t on the part of the spectrum of a which is less than Ll1  ≤  ε and zero otherwise.

(iv) is trivial for x∈H1, so suppose that x∈Uy for some y∈∂H1. The rank of g(x) is equal to the number of eigenvalues of a(x) which are greater than Lu1, and this number is n1 for a(y). Let M  ⊆  Γn consist of those multisets with the property that each element of the multiset is either greater than Lu1 or less than Ll1. Let A  ⊆  M consist of those multisets for which the number of elements greater than Lu1 is exactly n1, and let B be the complement of A relative to M. Then, A and B are separated. Since s(z)  ⊆  M, [formula], s(y)∈A, and Uy is connected, we conclude that s(z)∈A, [formula]. In particular, the rank of g(x) is n1, as required.

Observe that (iv) implies that the function which assigns to a point x∈V1 the submultiset of s(x) consisting of those eigenvalues which are greater than or equal to Lu1 is continuous on V1. p1(x) is the spectral projection on this submultiset for each x∈V1, and is thus continuous merely by the existence of the continuous functional calculus. This proves (v), and hence the claim.

The claim above (now proved) is the base case of an inductive argument. We now describe the construction of V2, p2, and the definition of g on [formula]. The construction of the subsequent Vis, pis, and the definition of g on [formula] will be similar -- all of the essential difficulties are encountered already for i = 2.

Let [formula] be the boundary of [formula] inside Vc1 (we may assume that this boundary is nonempty by shrinking V1, if necessary). Find, as before, the minimum value η2 > 0 occuring as a non-zero eigenvalue of [formula]. Define

[formula]

and

[formula]

(Note the dependence of Ll2 on η1.) Find, for each [formula], a connected open (rel Vc1) set Ux  ⊆  Vc1 containing x and with the property that for every y∈Ux, the eigenvalues of a(y) are all either greater than Lu2 or less than Ll2. Let [formula] be an open set in X such that [formula]. Put

[formula]

Refine the simplicial structure on X so that we may find (using Lemma [\ref=cellapprox]) a subcomplex Y2 of Vc1 which is disjoint from Wc2 and whose interior (rel Vc1) contains [formula]. Put [formula] (interior taken (rel Vc1)). Thus, Vc2 and [formula] are subcomplexes of X. Define p2(x) to be the support projection of a(x) for [formula]. For any [formula], some [formula], let p2(x) be the support projection of those eigenvectors of a(y) corresponding to eigenvalues greater than Lu2. Put g(x)  =  p2(x)a(x), [formula].

Claim: p2 and g(x) so defined have the desired properties, namely,

g(x)  =  a(x), [formula];

g(x) is continuous on [formula];

||g(x) - a(x)||  <  ε, [formula];

[formula], [formula];

p2 extends to a continuous projection valued function on [formula] such that

[formula]

and p1(x)  ≤  p2(x) whenever [formula].

The proofs of all but the last part of (v) are identical to the proofs of the corresponding statements for p1 above. We must show that p1(x)  ≤  p2(x) whenever [formula]. This follows from the fact that the eigenvalues of (1 - p2(x))a(x)(1 - p2(x)) are all less than or equal to Ll2  ≤  Ll1, and so correspond to eigenvectors in the complement of the range of p1(x).

The remaining pis, i  <  k, may be constructed inductively in a manner similar to the construction of p2: let ηi be the minimum eigenvalue taken by a on [formula] -- boundary relative to [formula] both here and below, and assumed to be nonempty by shrinking [formula] if necessary -- and put

[formula]

and

[formula]

find connected open (rel [formula]) sets Ux for each [formula] which contain x, and have the property that every eigenvalue of a(y), y∈Ux, is either greater than Lui or less than Lli; find open sets [formula] such that [formula], and define

[formula]

refine the simplicial structure on X and find (using Lemma [\ref=cellapprox]) a subcomplex Yi of Vci - 1 which is disjoint from Wci and whose interior (rel Vci - 1) contains [formula]; put [formula], (interior taken (rel Vci - 1)) so that Vci and [formula] are subcomplexes of X; define pi(x) to be the support projection of the eigenvectors of a(x) with non-zero eigenvalues for [formula], and the support projection of those eigenvectors of a(x) having eigenvalues greater than or equal to Lui for [formula]; put g  =  pi(x)a(x), [formula].

pi and g so defined have the desired properties. As before, all but the last part of statement (v) follow from the proofs of the corresponding facts for p1 and p2. So suppose that [formula], where j  ≤  i. The range of 1 - pi(x) correponds to the span of eigenvectors of a(x) with eigenvalues less than or equal to Lli  ≤  Llj. This range is contained in the range of 1 - pj(x), since the latter corresponds to the span of eigenvectors of a(x) with eigenvalues less than Llj. It follows that pj(x)  ≤  pi(x), as required.

For i = k, the situation is straightforward. Simply put g(x)  =  a(x), [formula].

Step 2. We have [formula]. Since the Hi are closed, we may find open sets [formula] such that [formula]. Moreover, we may assume, using Lemma [\ref=cellapprox], that Uci and [formula] are subcomplexes (possibly empty) of X for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Let us define a positive upper semicontinuous function [formula] as follows: (x)  =  pi(x)a(x), [formula]. Then, (x)  ≥  g, [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is well supported by the pis. To see this, one need only check the coherence condition. Put [formula], and let [formula], j  ≤  i. The range of 1 - pi(x) correponds to the span of eigenvectors of a(x) with eigenvalues less than or equal to Lli  ≤  Llj (since Ui  ⊆  Vi). This range is contained in the range of 1 - pj(x), since the latter corresponds to the span of eigenvectors of a(x) with eigenvalues less than Llj. It follows that pj(x)  ≤  pi(x), as required.

We now describe a smoothing process which will transform [formula] into the function f required by the theorem. For the first step in our process we work inside [formula]. Find a continuous function [formula] which is zero on [formula], one on [formula], and non-zero off [formula]. Define fk - 1 on [formula] as follows:

[formula]

fk - 2 is continuous on [formula] and dominates g on [formula]. It is also subordinate to a.

For the generic step in our process, we work inside [formula], i  ≥  3. Assume that we have found a continuous function [formula] such that

[formula]

(This is the key property required to go from one stage in the smoothing process to the next.) Find a continuous function [formula] which is zero on [formula], one on [formula], and non-zero off [formula]. Define fk - i on [formula] as follows:

[formula]

Then, as before, fk - i is continuous on [formula], dominates g, and is subordinate to a. This smoothing process terminates when i  =  k - 1, and the resulting continuous function [formula] has the desired properties. (Note that the sets Hi of Definition [\ref=trivial] corresponding to f are precisely the [formula]. The sets [formula] of Definition [\ref=trivial] corresponding to f are thus the [formula], and so are subcomplexes of the refined simplicial structure on X.)

Trivial majorants

The projection p may be viewed as a vector bundle (E,r,Y). E is trivial, and so admits l mutually orthogonal and everywhere non-zero cross-sections si:Y  →  E, 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. We will prove that each si can be extended to a continuous map vi defined on all of X which takes values in [formula], and that these extensions can be chosen to be mutually orthogonal. The projection whose range at a point x∈X is [formula] is then the projection q that we seek.

We proceed by induction. First consider s1, which may be viewed as a continuous map from Y to [formula]. Theorem 2.2 in Chapter 1 of [\cite=H] states that if (A,B) is a relative CW-complex and R is a space which is connected in each dimension for which A has cells, then every continuous map f:B  →  R extends to a continuous map g:A  →  R. (X,Y) is a relative CW-complex, [formula] is (2n - 1)-connected, and 2n - 1  ≥  d, so s1 extends to a continuous map [formula], as desired.

Suppose now that we have found mutually orthogonal and continous extensions vi of si for each i  <  k  ≤  l. We wish to extend sk to a continous map vk on X taking values in E and pointwise orthogonal to [formula]. Let [formula] be the projection whose range at a point x∈X is [formula]. To find our extension vk, it will suffice to extend sk to an everywhere non-zero cross-section inside

[formula]

(the last isomorphism follows from the fact that [formula] is trivial). This problem is identical to the problem of extending s1, save that we are now extending a map from Y into [formula] rather than into [formula]. Since n - l  ≥  ⌈d / 2⌉ + 1, we have that 2(n - k) - 1  ≥  d. Since [formula] is 2(n - k) - 1-connected, we may use Theorem 2.2, Chapter 1, [\cite=H], to find the desired extension vk.

Put [formula]. For each [formula], put

[formula]

Let [formula] be the list of Dns which have nonempty intersection with [formula], ordered so that some (and hence every) element of [formula] is less than every element of [formula]. For 1  ≤  j  ≤  s, let Jj be the set of indices of the nis appearing in [formula].

For A  ⊆  X put

[formula]

The condition that pi(x)  ≤  pj(x) whenever [formula] and i  ≤  j implies that PA(x) is an upper semicontinuous projection-valued function for every A  ⊆  X.

An application of [\cite=BE] allows us to find a constant rank projection-valued map [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows that [formula] for every i∈Js. For every N  ≥  d, there is a projection [formula] of rank n such that [formula] corresponds to a trivial vector bundle (cf. Theorem [\ref=projcomp]). Put

[formula]

and

[formula]

Rs so chosen satisfies conditions (i), (ii), and (iv) in the conclusion of the lemma; conditions (iii) and (v) are not yet relevant.

Now suppose that we have found, for each m  <  l  ≤  s, constant rank projections [formula] satisfying conditions (i)-(iv) of the conclusion of the lemma, and satisfying condition (v) whenever t,l  >  m. We will construct Rm on Vm so that [formula] satisfy (i)-(iv), and satisfy (v) when t,l  ≥  m. Proceeding inductively then yields the lemma.

Define a projection-valued map

[formula]

by setting [formula] if l > m is the smallest index such that x∈Vl, and setting [formula] equal to the unit of the (arbitrarily large) matrix algebra which constitutes the target space of all of our projection-valued maps otherwise. One easily checks that [formula] is lower semicontinuous, and that

[formula]

An application of [\cite=BE] then yields a constant rank projection-valued map [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Applying [\cite=BE] to [formula] and Qm yields a constant rank projection-valued map [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

By [\cite=H], there is a subprojection [formula] of Q'm - Qm with constant rank ≤  d such that [formula] corresponds to a trivial vector bundle over Vm. By definition we have

[formula]

From the definition of [formula] we have

[formula]

Rm + 1 - Tm is a trivial projection on [formula], and so can be extended to a trivial projection of the same rank on [formula] by Lemma [\ref=extendone] (this requires the fact that the Rj, m  <  j  ≤  s, satisfy condition (iii) in the conclusion of the lemma). We can repeat this extension process until Rm + 1 - Tm has been extended to a trivial constant rank projection T'm defined on [formula] and satisfying

[formula]

Note that the rank of T'm is at least d. Choose a trivial subprojection T''m of T'm with the property that [formula]. Apply Lemma [\ref=extendone] to extend T''m to Vm inside the complement of Tm, and put

[formula]

Rm(x) so defined has the desired properties.

We proceed by induction on k. Consider the case k = 1. Since we may view R1 as upper semicontinuous projection-valued map from X into [formula] for n large, and since (X,U1) is a relative cell complex with cells of dimension at most d  ≪  n, we may apply Lemma [\ref=extendone] to extend R1 to a projection [formula] on X corresponding to a trivial vector bundle. Write [formula] for line bundles [formula], each of which corresponds to a trivial vector bundle. Then,

[formula]

as desired.

Now suppose that the lemma holds for i  <  k. Conditions (i) and (iii) in the hypotheses of the lemma together with Lemma [\ref=extendone] allow us to extend R1 to a trivial projection on [formula] subordinate to [formula]. Iterating this process, we extend R1 to a trivial projection [formula] on [formula] which is subordinate to [formula]. Finally, apply Lemma [\ref=extendone] once more to extend [formula] to a trivial projection on all of X. Write [formula], where each pj is projection corresponding to a one-dimensional trivial vector bundle on X. Then, as before,

[formula]

By [\cite=H], we have that Ri  -  R1 is trivial for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. If i  >  1, then Ri - R1 has rank greater than or equal to ⌈d / 2⌉ + 1. It follows that the projections [formula] over the subcomplexes [formula], respectively, satisfy the hypotheses of the lemma. Moreover, these projections may be viewed as maps from X into the orthgonal complement of [formula]. It follows that there exist rank one projections [formula], each corresponding to a trivial vector bundle and each orthogonal to [formula], which satisfy

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and the lemma follows.

We may assume that ||a||  ≤  1. Let [formula] be the rank values taken by a, and let ε > 0 be given. Form an approximant f to a satisfying the conclusions of Theorem [\ref=wellsupapprox], where the sets [formula] corresponding to f (cf. Definition [\ref=trivial]) are subcomplexes of X satisfying the conlusion of Lemma [\ref=cellapprox]. Let [formula] be the supporting projections for f, and notice that these satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma [\ref=trivcomp]. The conclusion of Lemma [\ref=trivcomp] then provides a family of constant rank projections [formula], 1  ≤  l  ≤  s, (each Vl is a union of consecutive [formula]s). These, in addition to satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma [\ref=trivbasis], have the properties that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Set m0 = 0 and [formula]. Let [formula] be the family of mutually orthogonal rank one projections, each corresponding to a trivial bundle, which are provided by the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=trivbasis], i.e.,

[formula]

By construction (see the proof of Theorem [\ref=wellsupapprox]) we have that

[formula]

Put

[formula]

Use Lemma [\ref=cellapprox] to find, inductively (and upon refining the simplicial structure of X if necessary), subcomplexes [formula] of X satisfying:

[formula]

The set Vl is a union of consecutive [formula]s; let Jl be the set of indices occurring among these [formula]s, and let Ml be the largest element of Jl. Put

[formula]

For each 1  ≤  l  ≤  s, choose a continuous function gl:X  →  [0,1] which is identically one on [formula], identically zero on HMl - 1,a, and nonzero off HMl - 1,a. Then,

[formula]

is a trivial element of [formula] such that [formula], [formula].

We claim that for all x∈X, we have

[formula]

Indeed,

[formula]

and gj is nonzero on Al if and only if j  ≤  l. We have chosen gj to satisfy

[formula]

so x∈Al if and only if

[formula]

Thus, for x∈Al, [formula] for some i∈Jl. We have that

[formula]

whence [formula], [formula]. This proves the claim.

If d is trivial and satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem, then

[formula]

It follows from Proposition [\ref=trivrankcomp] that

[formula]

Thus, for every ε > 0, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

ε was arbitrary, and the theorem follows.

Trivial minorants

The hypotheses of the theorem imply that d  =  0 if [formula], in which case the theorem holds.

Suppose that [formula]. We proceed by induction on k. Suppose that a takes rank values [formula], and, with n0  =  0, put

[formula]

Suppose that k = 1. If [formula], then there is nothing to prove, so assume that [formula]. By [\cite=H], a (which, since it only takes one rank value, is Cuntz equivalent to a projection) is Cuntz equivalent to [formula] for some projection [formula]. The projection [formula] is trivial, and so dominates any trivial d satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem by Proposition [\ref=trivrankcomp].

Now suppose that we have proved the theorem when a takes i  <  k rank values. We treat two cases: [formula] and [formula].

Suppose first that [formula]. Then, any trivial d satisfying the hypotheses of the theorem necessarily satisfies

[formula]

Put εn  =  1 / 2n. Since ||d(x)|| is uniformly continuous on [formula], there exists a sequence (δn) of nonnegative reals such that ||d(x) - d(y)|| < εn / 3 whenever [formula]. For each [formula], let [formula] be the closed set which is the complement of the set of points in [formula] whose distance from [formula] is strictly less than δn, and let Un be the closed set consisting of those points in [formula] whose distance from [formula] is less than or equal to δn / 2. Choose a function [formula] which is identically zero on Un and identically one on Vn. Notice that ||d(x)||  <  ε, [formula]. Upon restriction to [formula], a takes at most k - 1 rank values. Since [formula] and [formula] satisfy the hypothese of the theorem a fortiori, there is an element [formula] such that

[formula]

Put gn  =  fn  ·  wn, and note that since fn is zero off [formula], we may view gn as an element of [formula]. Now,

[formula]

and for every x∈Vcn

[formula]

(the second-to-last inequality uses that fn(x)  =  0, [formula].) Thus,

[formula]

and [formula], as desired.

Now suppose that [formula]. We will reduce to the case [formula], proving the theorem. By [\cite=DNNP], there is a projection p on X such that

[formula]

and [formula]. An application of [\cite=H] yields a trivial subprojection θm of p, where [formula]. By [\cite=PT], there is a positive element [formula] such that [formula]. Let [formula] be the first m trivial rank one projections supporting d (cf. Definition [\ref=trivial]). Then, [formula] (where ~   is in fact true Murray-von Neumann equivalence, and

[formula]

and

[formula]

are trivial. Moreover, d' and b (substituted for d and a, respectively) satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem, b takes k rank values, and the lowest rank value taken by b is less than or equal to [formula]. We may thus apply our proof above to conclude that [formula]. Since [formula] we have

[formula]

as desired.

The main theorem

Combining Theorems [\ref=trivmajor] and [\ref=trivminor] yields the theorem with 9d replaced by 5d + 4. But if d = 0, then

[formula]

implies [formula] by [\cite=Pe1]. If d  ≥  1, then 5d + 4  ≤  9d.

Theorem [\ref=main] applies equally well to locally compact second countable Hausdorff spaces whose one point compactifications have finite covering dimension. We fully expect that it will generalise to recursive subhomogeneous C*-algebras.

Applications to AH algebras

The dimension-rank ratio vs. the radius of comparison

Recall the terminology concerning AH algebras from Section 1. A unital AH algebra A has flat dimension growth ([\cite=To3]) if it admits a decomposition for which

[formula]

To study unital AH algebras with flat dimension growth was suggested by Blackadar ([\cite=Bl2]) in 1991, but there were no non-trivial examples of such algebras -- algebras with flat dimension growth but not slow dimension growth -- until the pioneering work of Villadsen in 1997 ([\cite=V1]). We initiated the study of such algebras in earnest in [\cite=To3]. Our key tool was the dimension-rank ratio of a unital AH algebra A (write [formula]), an isomorphism invariant which is defined to be the infimum of the set of nonnegative reals c such that A has a decomposition satisfying

[formula]

This invariant may be thought of as a measure of the ratio of the topological dimension of A to its matricial size, despite the fact that both quantities may be infinite. Its effectiveness in studying AH algebras of flat dimension growth leads one naturally to consider whether it has an analogue defined for all unital and stably finite C*-algebras. In [\cite=To3] we introduced the following candidate:

Theorem [\ref=main] confirms the radius of comparison as the proper abstraction of the dimension-rank ratio for semi-homogeneous algebras.

Suppose first that n = 1. The first inequality is [\cite=To3]. For the second inequality, use [\cite=To3] to conclude that [formula]; the inequality now follows from the definition of the radius of comparison and Theorem [\ref=main]. To prove the theorem for general n use the following facts:

[formula]

and

[formula]

for any unital AH algebras A and B ([\cite=To3] and [\cite=To3], resp.).

We will address the relationship between the dimension-rank ratio and the radius of comparison for general AH algebras in a separate paper.

Strict comparison of positive elements

The next lemma is due to M. Rørdam. We are grateful for his permission to use it here.

First find a positive element b in some [formula], i∈I, such that

[formula]

Put ã: = (b - ε / 4)+. The conclusion follows from Proposition [\ref=basics] and the estimate ||a - ã||  <  ε.

By working in a matrix algebra over A, we may assume that a,b∈A. Since the φi are injective, we simply identify a and b with their forward images in Aj, j  ≥  i, and in A itself. We have [formula] in [formula], so there is a sequence (vn) in [formula] such that

[formula]

This sequence may be chosen to lie in the dense local C*-algebra [formula]. Indeed, for any wn∈A we have

[formula]

so choosing [formula] sufficiently close to vn yields

[formula]

Let ε > 0 be given. Find [formula] such that

[formula]

and [formula]. It then follows from Proposition [\ref=basics] that [formula] inside [formula], as desired.

We will prove that W(A) is almost unperforated, i.e., that whenever one has 〈a〉,〈b〉∈W(A) such that (n + 1)〈a〉  ≤  n〈b〉, then 〈a〉  ≤  〈b〉. It then follows from [\cite=R4] that A has strict comparison of positive elements.

Let [formula] be positive, and suppose that [formula] for some [formula]. Let ε > 0 be given, and find δ > 0 such that

[formula]

Use Lemma [\ref=posapprox1] to find some [formula] and [formula] such that:

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=posapprox2] we may, by increasing i if necessary, assume that

[formula]

inside [formula]. Since A is simple, we may assume that the images of both (ã  -  ε / 4)+ and [formula] under any [formula] are non-zero. It follows that

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=ineq3]) shows that for any [formula],

[formula]

The map τ  ↦  sτ() is strictly positive and lower semicontinuous on the compact space [formula]. It therefore achieves a minimum value c > 0, and

[formula]

Increasing i if necessary, we may assume that [formula], whence

[formula]

by the definition of [formula]. From ([\ref=aest]) we have the inequality

[formula]

whence

[formula]

by the functional calculus. Combining ([\ref=best]) and ([\ref=aest2]) we have

[formula]

Since ε was arbitrary, the theorem follows from Proposition [\ref=basics].

As in equation ([\ref=decomp]) we have A =  lim i  →    ∞(Ai,φi), where

[formula]

A has slow dimension growth, so we may assume that the φi are injective (this is the main result of [\cite=EGL3]) and that

[formula]

This last condition, by [\cite=To3], implies that [formula] as i  →    ∞  . Proposition [\ref=semihomrc] then shows that [formula] as i  →    ∞  , and we have collected the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=rczerolim].

Combining Corollary [\ref=ahaup] with earlier work of Rørdam we recover the characterisation of real rank zero for simple unital AH algebras of slow dimension growth obtained in [\cite=BDR].

A has stable rank one by the results of [\cite=BDR], and a weakly unperforated Cuntz semigroup by Corollary [\ref=ahaup]. Apply [\cite=R4].

Finally, we have that several theorems on Z-stable C*-algebras recently proved by Brown, Perera, and the author can be extended to AH algebras with slow dimension growth.

Since A has strict comparison of positive elements, we may appeal to Theorem 5.4 and Corollary 6.9 of [\cite=BPT].

We refer the reader to Section 4 of [\cite=PT] for an explicit description of the functor which reconstructs W(A) from the Elliott invariant of A in (i) above.
