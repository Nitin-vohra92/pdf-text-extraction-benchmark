Coarse structures and group actions

Introduction

The proof in [\cite=BDM] of the Svarc-Milnor Lemma was based on the idea that isometric actions of groups ought to induce a coarse structure on the group under reasonable conditions. Since left coarse structures on countable groups are unique (in the sense of independence on the left-invariant proper metric), Svarc-Milnor Lemma follows.

In this paper we investigate cases where group actions on sets induce a natural coarse structure on the set. As usual, the uniqueness of the coarse structure is of interest.

We will use two approaches to coarse structures on a set X:

The original one of Roe [\cite=Roe_lectures] based on controlled subsets of X  ×  X.

The one from [\cite=DydHof] based on uniformly bounded families in X.

The reason is that certain concepts and results have a more natural meaning in a particular approach to coarse structures. Recall that one can switch from one approach to another using the following basic facts (see [\cite=DydHof]):

If {Bs}s∈S is uniformly bounded, then [formula] is controlled.

If E is controlled, then there is a uniformly bounded family {Bs}s∈S such that [formula].

To define a coarse structure using uniformly bounded families one needs to verify the following conditions

B1 is uniformly bounded implies B2 is uniformly bounded if each element of B2 consisting of more than one point is contained in some element of B1.

B1,B2 uniformly bounded implies [formula] is uniformly bounded.

A function f:(X,CX)  →  (Y,CY) of coarse spaces is large scale uniform (or bornologous) if f(B)∈CY for every B∈CX.

f is coarsely proper if f- 1(U) is bounded for every bounded subset U of Y.

f is coarse if it is large scale uniform and coarsely proper.

Recall that two functions f,g:S  →  (X,CX) from a set S to a coarse space (X,CX) are close if the family {{f(s),g(s)}}s∈S is bounded.

A coarse function f:(X,CX)  →  (Y,CY) of coarse spaces is a coarse equivalence if there is a coarse function g:(Y,CY)  →  (X,CX) such that [formula] is close to idY and [formula] is close to idX.

Here is a simple criterion for being a coarse equivalence using the approach of [\cite=DydHof]:

Proof. Let g:Y  →  X be a selection for y  →  f- 1(y). Put B' = {f- 1(y)}y∈Y∈CX.

If g:(Y,CY)  →  (X,CX) is bornologous, then f- 1(B) refines [formula], resulting in f- 1(B) being uniformly bounded.

Let us show g is bornologous if f is a coarse equivalence. Choose h:(Y,CY)  →  (X,CX) that is bornologous and [formula] is B1-close to idX for some B1∈CX. Therefore [formula] is B1-close to g and g is bornologous.

Assume f- 1(B) is a uniformly bounded family in X for each uniformly bounded family B in Y. If g is bornologous, then f is a coarse equivalence as [formula] and [formula] is B'-close to idX. If B∈CY, then g(B) refines f- 1(B), so it is uniformly bounded and g is bornologous. [formula]

Proof. Suppose B∈C1 is uniformly bounded. Since f- 1(B)∈CX by [\ref=CharOfCoarseEq] and f:(X,CX)  →  (Y,C2) is bornologous, B = f(f- 1(B))∈C2. Similarly, C2  ⊂  C1. [formula]

We will see in [\ref=MonoFromZtoDih] that f being surjective is necessary.

Coarse structures on groups

Given a group G one can equip it with either the left coarse structure Cl(G) or right coarse structure Cr(G). For countable groups G those structures are metrizable by proper left-invariant (proper right-invariant) metrics on G.

In terms of controlled sets E∈Cl(G) if and only if there is a finite subset F of G such that x- 1  ·  y∈F for all (x,y)∈E. Similarly, E∈Cr(G) if and only if there is a finite subset F of G such that x  ·  y- 1∈F for all (x,y)∈E. Notice all functions x  →  g  ·  x (g∈G being fixed) are coarse self-equivalences of (G,Cl(G)) and all functions x  →  x  ·  g are coarse self-equivalences of (G,Cr(G)). We will primarily deal with the structure Cl(G) (notice x  →  x- 1 induces isomorphism of structures Cl(G) and Cr(G)) but first we will characterize cases where the two structures are identical.

Proof. [formula]. Fix a∈G and consider the family {{x,a  ·  x}}x∈G. It is uniformly bounded in Cr(G), so it must be uniformly bounded in Cl(G) but that means the set {x- 1  ·  a  ·  x}x∈G is finite, i.e. the set of conjugacy classes of a is finite. The same proof shows [formula].

[formula]. Given a uniformly bounded family B in Cl(G) there is a finite subset F of G such that u- 1  ·  v∈F for all u,v belonging to the same element of B. Let E be the set of conjugacy classes of all elements of F. If u,v belong to the same element of B, then there is f∈F so that u- 1  ·  v = f. Thus v = u  ·  f and v  ·  u- 1 = u  ·  f  ·  u- 1∈E. Thus B is uniformly bounded in Cr(G). The same argument shows Cr(G)  ⊂  Cl(G). [formula]

Proof. Consider the presentation [formula] of Dih∞. Identify [formula] with the subgroup of Dih∞ generated by x. Notice [formula] is of index 2 in Dih∞, so [formula] is a coarse equivalence for both left and right coarse structures. Since [formula] is Abelian, those coincide on that group but Cl(Dih∞)  ≠  Cr(Dih∞) as the conjugacy class of x equals [formula]. [formula]

Proof. Suppose F is a finite subset of G. Consider the uniformly bounded family {F  ×  {x}}x∈G in Cl(G)  ×  Cl(G). Since m(F  ×  {x}) = F  ·  x, the family {F  ·  x}x∈G∈C(G)l. Thus Cr(G)  ⊂  Cl(G) and Cl(G) = Cr(G) by [\ref=ComparingC_lAndC_r].

Suppose Cl(G) = Cr(G). It suffices to show that {m(x  ·  F  ×  y  ·  E)}(x,y)∈G  ×  G is uniformly bounded for every finite subsets F and E of G. Choose a finite subset E' and a function f:G  →  G such that x  ·  E  ⊂  E'  ·  f(x) for all x∈G. Pick a finite subset F' of G and a function g:G  →  G such that F  ·  E'  ·  y  ⊂  g(y)  ·  F' for all y∈G. Now m(x  ·  F  ×  y  ·  E)  ⊂  x  ·  F  ·  E'  ·  f(y)  ⊂  x  ·  g(f(y))  ·  F' and the proof is completed. [formula]

Inducing coarse structures by group actions

Our first task is to discuss cases of group actions of a group G on a set X inducing coarse structure CG on X such that g  →  g  ·  x0 is a coarse equivalence from (G,Cl(G)) to (X,CG) for all x0∈X.

Proof. (1). If γ:g  →  g  ·  x0 is a coarse equivalence, then γ- 1(x0) must be bounded in G, i.e. finite. Notice that γ- 1(x0) is precisely the stabilizer of x0.

(2). Assume the stabilizer S of x0 is finite. Define CG as follows: B∈CG if γ- 1(B) is uniformly bounded in Cl(G). If CG is a coarse structure and γ:(G,Cl(G))  →  (X,CG) is bornologous, then [\ref=CharOfCoarseEq] says γ is a coarse equivalence and the uniqueness of CG follows from [\ref=EqualityOfCS].

Since [formula], B1,B2∈CG implies [formula]. Given B∈CG we need to check that any family B', whose elements containing more than one point refine B, also belongs to CG. There is a finite subset F of G such that γ- 1(B) refines the family {g  ·  F}g∈G. Put [formula]. If {x}∈B', then γ- 1(x) = h  ·  S, where h∈G satisfies x = h  ·  x0. Thus γ- 1(B') refines {g  ·  E}g∈G, so B'∈CG. [formula]

Proof. First define the bounded sets of CG. Those are subsets of sets of the form F  ·  U, where F is any finite subset of G. Second, define CG as families B such that there is a bounded set V so that B refines {g  ·  V}g∈G. Notice that, if B' is a family whose elements containing more than one point refine B, then B' refines [formula] and [formula] is bounded. Thus B'∈CG.

The important property of bounded sets V is that their stabilizers [formula] are finite. It suffices to prove that for V = F  ·  U, F  ⊂  G being finite. If [formula], then there exist elements fi∈F, i = 1,2, such that [formula] which implies [formula]. Thus f- 11gf2∈SU and g∈F  ·  SU  ·  F- 1 which proves SV is finite.

The second useful observation is that [formula] is bounded for any bounded set V and any B∈CG. Indeed, if B refines {g  ·  W}g∈G for some bounded W, we may assume V  ⊂  W in which case V intersects only finitely many elements of {g  ·  W}g∈G. Since those are all bounded and a finite union of bounded sets is bounded, we are done.

Suppose B1,B2∈CG and choose bounded sets Vi, i = 1,2, such that Bi refines {g  ·  Vi}g∈G. Put [formula] and notice V is bounded. Our aim is to show [formula] refines {g  ·  V}g∈G. If [formula], then [formula], so [formula] resulting in [formula]. [formula]

Let us point out that, surprisingly, the structure CG in [\ref=CreateSecondCS] does not have to be unique contrary to typical categorical intuition.

Proof. Consider the presentation [formula] of Dih∞. Identify [formula] with the subgroup of Dih∞ generated by x. Notice [formula] is of index 2 in Dih∞, so [formula] is a coarse equivalence for both left and right coarse structures. Since [formula] is Abelian, those coincide on that group but [\ref=MonoFromZtoDih] says that Cl(Dih∞)  ≠  Cr(Dih∞). [formula]

Actions by uniformly bornologous functions

We want to generalize isometric actions to the framework of coarse geometry. The appropriate concept is not only to require that each function x  →  g  ·  x is bornologous but that those functions are uniformly bornologous.

A group G acts on a coarse space (X,CX) by uniformly bornologous functions if for any controlled set E there is a controlled set E' such that (g  ·  x,g  ·  y)∈E' for all (x,y)∈E and all g∈G.

Proof. Suppose the action is by uniformly bornologous functions and B  =  {Bs}s∈S is a uniformly bounded family. Put [formula] and notice it is a controlled set. Pick a controlled set E' such that (g  ·  x,g  ·  y)∈E' for all g∈G and all (x,y)∈E. Define B' as the family of all B  ⊂  X satisfying B  ×  B  ⊂  E'. It is a uniformly bounded family containing G  ·  B.

Suppose the family G  ·  B  =  {g  ·  Bs}(g,s)∈G  ×  S is uniformly bounded for any uniformly bounded family B  =  {Bs}s∈S in X. Assume E is a symmetric controlled set containing the diagonal. Consider the family B of all sets B  ⊂  X such that [formula] and let [formula]. It is a controlled set and, if (x,y)∈E, then [formula] and (g  ·  x,g  ·  y)∈E'. [formula]

Proof. Given a uniformly bounded family B  =  {Bs}s∈S in X, the family {{g}  ×  Bs}(g,s)∈G  ×  S is uniformly bounded in G  ×  X, so {φ({g}  ×  Bs)}(g,s)∈G  ×  S is uniformly bounded which means G  ·  B is uniformly bounded. [formula]

Notice that the infinite dihedral group Dih∞ acts on itself by left multiplication so that the action is by uniformly bornologous functions but the multiplication is not bornologous (see [\ref=MultBornImpliesBothStructuresTheSame] and [\ref=MonoFromZtoDih]).

Coarsely proper and cobounded actions

An action φ of a group G on a coarse space (X,CX) is coarsely proper if φx:G  →  G  ·  x is coarsely proper for all x∈X.

Proof. It follows from the fact φ- 1x(U) = {g∈G|x∈g- 1  ·  U} for all x∈X and U  ⊂  X. [formula]

Proof. Notice the stabilizer of x0 is finite by [\ref=CharOfCoarselyProperActions] and use (2) of [\ref=CreateFirstCS]. [formula]

Proof. One direction is obvious in view of [\ref=CharOfCoarselyProperActions], so assume φ is an action by uniformly bornologous functions that is coarsely proper. If [formula] is infinite for some bounded set U, then put [formula] and notice that φ- 1x(V) contains SU for all x∈U, a contradiction. [formula]

An action of a group G on a coarse space (X,CX) is cobounded if X = G  ·  U for some bounded subset U of X.

Proof. Pick a bounded set V such that G  ·  V = X. Given B  =  {Bs}s∈S∈CX put [formula]. U is bounded and B refines {g  ·  V}g∈G. [formula]

Proof. By [\ref=CharOfCSUnderCoarseA] both structures are generated by families {g  ·  U}g∈G, where U is bounded. [formula]

Coarse actions

An action of a group G on a coarse space (X,C) is coarse if it is coarsely proper, cobounded, and by uniformly bornologous functions.

Proof. By [\ref=CPAndUBActions] the function g  →  g  ·  x0 is a coarse equivalence from G to G  ·  x0. Notice the inclusion G  ·  x0  →  X is a coarse equivalence by the coboundedness of the action. [formula]

Proof. Pick a bounded set (in both coarse structures) U such that Gi  ·  U = X for i = 1,2. Pick x0∈U. Define ψ:G2  →  G1 so that h- 1  ·  x0∈ψ(h)  ·  U for all h∈G2.

To show ψ is large scale uniform consider a finite subset F of G2 containing identity, define V = F- 1  ·  U and define E as the set of all g∈G1 so that [formula]. Suppose h = h- 11h2∈F and gi  =  ψ(hi) for i = 1,2. Consider y = g- 11(h- 12  ·  x0) and put g = g- 11g2. Our goal is to show [formula] resulting in g∈E. Since g- 1  ·  y = g- 12(h- 12  ·  x0)∈U  ⊂  V, y∈g  ·  V. Now, as h2 = h1  ·  h, y = g- 11(h- 12  ·  x0) = g- 11(h- 1  ·  h- 11  ·  x0) = h- 1(g- 11(h- 11  ·  x0))  ⊂  h- 1  ·  U  ⊂  F- 1  ·  U = V.

Similarly, define φ:G1  →  G2 so that g- 1  ·  x0∈φ(g)  ·  U for all g∈G1 and notice it is large scale uniform.

Let B be a uniformly bounded family in C1 so that all sets g  ·  U, g∈G1, refine B. Let us observe g  →  g  ·  x0 and g  →  ψ(φ(g))  ·  x0 are [formula]-close. Indeed, using the definition of φ and commutativity of two actions, we get φ(g)- 1  ·  x0∈g  ·  U, and by definition of ψ we have φ(g)- 1  ·  x0∈ψ(φ(g))  ·  U. Since g  →  g  ·  x0 is a coarse equivalence from G1 to (X1,C1) (see [\ref=CoarseAInducesCoarseEq]), [formula] is close to the identity of G1. Similarly, [formula] is close to the identity of G2. [formula]

Topological actions

Let X be a topological space and G be a group. Recall that an action of G on X is topologically proper if each point x∈X has a neighborhood Ux such that the stabilizer [formula] of Ux is finite. An action of G on X is cocompact if there exists a compact subspace K  ⊂  X such that G  ·  K = X.

Let X be a locally compact topological space. An action of a group G on X is topological if it is by homeomorphisms, it is cocompact and topologically proper.

Proof. Uniqueness of φ follows from [\ref=CoarseAOnTwoStructures]. Let us show that the stabilizer of each compact subset K of X is finite. If it is not, then there is an infinite subset I of G and points [formula] for each g∈I. The set {xg}g∈I must be discrete (otherwise the action would not be topologically proper at its accumulation point), so infinitely many xg's are equal, a contradiction.

Consider the structure Cφ on X described in the proof of [\ref=CreateSecondCS]. Notice it has the required properties. [formula]

Proof. Use [\ref=GenralizedGromovThmTWO]. [formula]

It is not true that Cφ  =  Cψ in general. Use [\ref=TwoCSExistOnDih] and equip groups with discrete topologies.

Proof. Pick a coarse equivalence α:G  →  H. Choose a function c assigning to each finite subset F of G a finite subset c(F) of H with the property that u- 1  ·  v∈F implies α(u)- 1  ·  α(v)∈c(F).

Choose a function d assigning to each finite subset F of H a finite subset d(F) of G with the property that α(u)- 1  ·  α(v)∈F implies u- 1  ·  v∈d(F).

Let E be a finite subset of H so that H = α(G)  ·  E.

Let X be the space of all functions β:G  →  H satisfying the following conditions:

u- 1  ·  v∈F implies β(u)- 1  ·  β(v)∈c(F) for all finite subsets F of G,

β(u)- 1  ·  β(v)∈F implies u- 1  ·  v∈d(F) for all finite subsets F of H.

H = β(G)  ·  E.

We consider X with the compact-open topology provided both G and H are given the discrete topologies. Notice X is closed in the space HG of all functions from G to H equipped with the compact-open topology. Indeed, Conditions (1) and (2) above hold for all β∈cl(X), so it remains to check H = β(G)  ·  E for such β. Given h∈H consider the set F = β(1G)- 1  ·  h  ·  E- 1 and choose γ∈X so that γ(g) = β(g) for all [formula]. Pick g1∈G and e∈E so that h = γ(g1)  ·  e. Since γ(1G)- 1  ·  γ(g1)∈F, g1 = 1- 1G  ·  g1∈d(F) and γ(g1) = β(g1). Thus h∈β(G)  ·  E.

Notice X is locally compact. Indeed, given β∈X consider U = {γ∈X|γ(1G) = β(1G)}. It is clearly open and equals [formula], where K  ⊂  HG is the set of all functions u satisfying u(g)∈β(1G)  ·  c({g}). Notice K is compact (it is a product of finite sets). Since X is closed in HG, [formula] is compact as well.

The action of G on X is given by (g  ·  β)(x): = β(g  ·  x). The action of H on X is given by (h  ·  β)(x): = h  ·  β(x). Notice that the two actions commute. The action of H on X is cocompact: X = H  ·  K, where K = {β∈X|β(1G) = 1H}. The action of G on X is cocompact: X = G  ·  L, where L is the set of β∈X such that β(1G)∈E- 1 (which implies β(g)∈E- 1  ·  c({g}) for all g∈G so that L is compact). Indeed, for any γ∈X there is e∈E such that 1H  =  γ(g1)  ·  e for some g1∈G. Put β(x) = γ(g1  ·  x) and notice β(1G) = e- 1∈E- 1, so β∈L and γ = g1  ·  β.

Action of H is proper: given β∈X put U = {γ∈X|γ(1G) = β(1G)}. If [formula], then λ(1G) = β(1G) and h- 1  ·  λ(1G) = β(1G). Thus h = 1H.

Action of G is proper: given β∈X put U = {γ∈X|γ(1G) = β(1G)}. If [formula], then λ(1G) = β(1G) and λ(g- 1) = β(1G). Thus λ(g- 1) = λ(1G) which implies g- 1∈d({1H}), so the set of such g is finite. [formula]
