The moment problem with bounded density

Introduction

We consider the following moment problem: Let μ be a given Borel measure μ on [formula] and let y = (yα), [formula], be a given sequence. Under what conditions on y, do we have

[formula]

for some [formula]? (The notation Xα stands for the monomial [formula].) In Knill [\cite=knill], the measure dν: = hdμ is said to be uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to μ.

This moment problem ([\ref=density]) with density, initially studied by Hausdorff for the interval

[formula]

Notation, definitions and preliminary results

For a closed set [formula], let [formula] denote its associated Borel σ-algebra, and given a Borel measure μ on [formula], let [formula] be the standard Banach space of all bounded measurable functions on [formula] (except possibly on a subset of μ-measure zero).

Let [formula] be the ring of real polynomials in the variables [formula], and let [formula] be its subset of sums of squares. With ||.|| being the euclidean norm of [formula], the notation ||X||2 stands for the quadratic polynomial [formula]. For a real symmetric matrix A, the notation [formula] satnds for A is positive semidefinite.

Given a family [formula], denote by:

[formula] [formula], the polynomial [formula], for every [formula], and with the convention [formula].

[formula] [formula], the quadratic module generated by the gj's, that is,

[formula]

Given a sequence y = (yα) indexed in the canonical basis (Xα) of [formula], let [formula] be the linear functional

[formula]

Given a Borel set [formula], a sequence y = (yα) has a representing measure μ on [formula] if

[formula]

A Borel measure μ on [formula] with all its moments finite is said to be moment determinate if whenever

[formula]

holds for some measure ν, then ν  =  μ.

When [formula] and if

[formula]

then by a result from Nussbaum [\cite=nussbaum], y has a unique representing measure μ; see e.g. Berg [\cite=berg]. Condition ([\ref=carleman]) is called the generalized Carleman condition as an extension to the multivariate case of Carleman's condition for the univariate case.

We next recall several important results concerning necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence y = (yα) to have a representing measure on a compact basic semi-algebraic set [formula].

So, let [formula] be a basic semi-algebraic set defined by:

[formula]

for some polynomials [formula].

Let [formula] be compact and defined as in ([\ref=setk]).

(a) A given sequence y = (yα) has a representing measure μ on [formula] if and only if:

[formula]

(b) Assume that for some M > 0, the quadratic polynomial M - ||X||2 is in Q(g). A given sequence y = (yα) has a representing measure μ on [formula] if and only if:

[formula]

(with the convention [formula]).

Theorem [\ref=rappel](a) is the dual part of Schmüdgen's Positivstellensatz [\cite=schmudgen] whereas its refinement (b) is due to Putinar [\cite=putinar] and Jacobi and Prestel [\cite=jacobi].

If one restricts f to have degree less than, say r, then testing conditions ([\ref=rappel-1]) and ([\ref=rappel-2]) reduces to checking whether some real-valued symmetric matrices are positive semidefinite. Indeed, given [formula], let Mr(θ  y) be the real symmetric matrix with rows and columns indexed in the canonical basis (Xα) of [formula], and defined by

[formula]

(where for every [formula], [formula]). Mr(θy) is called the localizing matrix associated with y and θ, and when [formula], Mr(y) is called the moment matrix associated with y.

Then testing condition ([\ref=rappel-1]) (resp. ([\ref=rappel-2])) for all [formula] with  deg  f  ≤  r, is equivalent to checking whether [formula] for all [formula] (resp. [formula] for all [formula]), i.e., computing the smallest eigenvalue of 2m (resp. m + 1) real symmetric matrices. If y is taken as unknown, then the LMIs (Linear Matrix Inequalities) [formula] (or [formula]) on y define the set of sequences y which have a representing measure μ on [formula]. Importantly, this set is convex.

Finally, given [formula], let [formula] be the polynomials

[formula]

Let [formula] be as in ([\ref=setk]), and assume that the gj's are normalized, i.e., [formula] on [formula] for all [formula], and that the family (0,1,{gj}) generates the algebra [formula]; equivalently [formula].

A given sequence y = (yα) has a representing measure μ on [formula] if and only if:

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=rappel3] is from Vasilescu [\cite=vasilescu] (also hidden in a previous result of Krivine [\cite=krivine1] [\cite=krivine2]). Notice that testing whether ([\ref=rappel3-1]) holds for all [formula] with |α|,|β|  ≤  r, reduces to checking whether finitely many inequalities are satisfied. If again y is taken as unknown, then the linear inequalities ([\ref=rappel3-1]) on y are another representation of the convex set of feasible sequences y which have a representing measure on [formula].

So this set can be represented either via LMIs through conditions ([\ref=rappel-1]) (or ([\ref=rappel-2])), or via linear inequalities through conditions ([\ref=rappel3-1]).

Main result

Let μ be a finite Borel measure on a Borel set [formula]. We want to find a set of necessary and/or sufficient conditions on a sequence y = (yα) to have a representing measure ν on [formula] that is uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to μ, that is, ν is absolutely continuous w.r.t. μ (denoted ν  ≪  μ) and its Radon-Nikodym derivative h belongs to [formula]. We first concentrate on the case where [formula] is basic compact semi-algebraic set as defined in ([\ref=setk]), and then consider the non compact case [formula].

The compact case

Let [formula] be compact and defined as in ([\ref=setk]). Let z = (zα) be the moment sequence of a finite Borel measures μ on [formula].

(a) A sequence y = (yα) has a representing Borel measure ν on [formula], uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to μ, if and only if there is some scalar κ such that for every [formula]:

[formula]

(b) In addition, if the polynomial N - ||X||2 belongs to the quadratic module Q(g) then one may replace ([\ref=thmain-1]) with the weaker condition

[formula]

(with the convention [formula]).

(c) Suppose that the gj's are normalized so that

[formula]

and that the family (0,1,{gj}) generates the algebra [formula].

A sequence y = (yα) has a representing Borel measure ν on [formula], uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to μ, if and only if there is some scalar κ such that for every [formula]:

[formula]

(a). The only if part: Let dν = hdμ for some [formula], and let κ: = ||h||∞. Observe that [formula] on [formula] for all [formula]. Therefore, for every [formula]:

[formula]

and so ([\ref=thmain-1]) is satisfied.

The if part: Let y and z be such that ([\ref=thmain-1]) holds true. Then by Theorem [\ref=rappel](a), y has a representing finite Borel measure ν on [formula]. In addition, let γ = (γα) with γα: = κzα - yα for all [formula]. From ([\ref=thmain-1]), one has

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=rappel](a) again, γ has a representing finite Borel measure ψ on [formula]. Moreover, from the definition of the sequence γ

[formula]

and therefore, as measures on compact sets are moment determinate, ψ  +  ν  =  κμ. Hence κμ  ≥  ν which shows that ν  ≪  μ. Finally, write dν = h  dμ for some [formula]. From ν  ≤  κμ one obtains

[formula]

and so 0  ≤  h  ≤  κ, μ-almost everywhere on [formula]. Equivalently, ||h||∞  ≤  κ, the desired result.

(b) The proof is a verbatim copy of (a), except that instead of invoking Theorem [\ref=rappel](a), we now invoke Theorem [\ref=rappel](b), its Putinar's refinement.

(c) The only if part: Let dν = hdμ for some [formula], and let κ: = ||h||∞. As [formula] and [formula] on [formula],

[formula]

for all [formula], and so ([\ref=thmain-3]) is satisfied.

The if part: Let y and z be such that ([\ref=thmain-3]) holds true. By Theorem [\ref=rappel3], y has a representing Borel measure ν on [formula]. In addition, let γ = (γα) with γα: = κzα - yα for all [formula]. From ([\ref=thmain-3]), the condition ([\ref=rappel3-1]) holds true with γ in lieu of y, and therefore, by Theorem [\ref=rappel3], γ has a representing Borel measure ψ on [formula]. Moreover, from the definition of γ, one has

[formula]

and the rest of the proof is the same as that of (a).

Recalling the definition of localizing matrices, notice that checking ([\ref=thmain-1]) for all [formula] with  deg  f  ≤  r, reduces to checking whether

[formula]

whereas checking ([\ref=thmain-2]) for all [formula] with  deg  f  ≤  r reduces to checking whether

[formula]

While checking the first LMIs in the left of both both ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) is just evaluating the smallest eigenvalue of the 2m symmetric matrices Mr(gJ  y), [formula] (resp. the m + 1 symmetric matrices Mr(gj  y), [formula]), checking the second LMIs in both ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) reduces to solving a semidefinite program with only one variable κ, and 2m (resp. m + 1) LMIs, a convex optimization problem for which efficient public softwares are now available.

On the other hand, checking ([\ref=thmain-3]) or all [formula] with  deg  f  ≤  r, reduces to solving a linear program with only one variable also, i.e., checking whether some interval is nonempty.

Theorem [\ref=thmain](c) is the analogue for compact basic semi-agebraic sets of Corollary 3.1 in Knill [\cite=knill] for the unit box n.

We next obtain a sufficient condition for the non-compact case.

The non-compact case

Let μ be a finite Borel measure on [formula]. We want to find a sufficient condition on a sequence y = (yα) to be the moment sequence of a measure ν on [formula] that is uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to μ.

Let z = (zα) be the moment sequence of a finite Borel measure μ on [formula], and assume that z satisfies the generalized Carleman condition, i.e.,

[formula]

Then a sequence y = (yα) has a representing Borel measure ν on [formula], uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to μ, if there exists a scalar 0 < κ such that for all [formula]:

[formula]

For every [formula], ([\ref=th2-3]) with f2 = X2ki yields

[formula]

and so, using ([\ref=th2-1]), one obtains

[formula]

for every [formula], i.e., the generalized Carleman condition ([\ref=carleman]) holds for the sequence y. Combining this with the first inequality in ([\ref=th2-3]) yields that y has a unique representing Borel measure ν on [formula]. It remains to prove that ν  ≪  μ and its density h is in [formula].

Let γ = (γα) with γα: = κzα - yα for all [formula]. Then the second inequality in ([\ref=th2-3]) yields

[formula]

Next, observe that from ([\ref=th2-3]), for every [formula], and every [formula],

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

and so, for every [formula],

[formula]

i.e., γ satisfies the generalized Carleman condition. In view of ([\ref=testt]), γ has a (unique) representing measure ψ on [formula]. Next, from the definition of γ, one has

[formula]

But as μ (and so κμ) satisfies Carleman condition ([\ref=th2-1]), κμ is moment determinate and therefore, κμ  =  ν  +  ψ.

Hence ν  ≪  μ follows from ν  ≤  κμ. Finally, writing dν = hdμ for some nonnegative [formula], and using ν  ≤  κμ, one obtains

[formula]

and so 0  ≤  h  ≤  κ, μ-almost everywhere on [formula]. Equivalently, ||h||∞  ≤  κ, the desired result.

Observe that condition ([\ref=th2-3]) is extremely simple as it is equivalent to stating that

[formula]

where Mr(z) (resp. Mr(y)) is the r-moment matrix associated with the sequence z (resp. y). Finally, a sufficient condition for ([\ref=th2-1]) to hold is

[formula]
