A Note on Primes Dividing Alternating Sums

We are all familiar with the harmonic sum:

[formula]

which can easily be shown not to be an integer unless n = 1 (see [\cite=APO], chapter 1, exercise 30).

On the other hand we can consider the alternating sum:

[formula]

which is not an integer either. Nevertheless we will be able to write [formula] with a and b being coprime integers.

Let us start by considering an odd integer n such that [formula] is a prime. Note that in such a case it is easily seen that n must satisfy [formula]. Now we construct the sum [formula] and we claim p divides a.

In fact we can write

[formula]

Of course, as p is a prime bigger than n, we see that the numbers [formula] are, all of them, units in [formula] (observe that [formula]). Moreover, there is an even number of summands in [formula]. Now, if we work modulo p and we choose any [formula] we find that [formula] so [formula] and we get that [formula] as claimed.

Now, if we choose an even number n such as [formula] is a prime, we can reason in the same way and conclude that [formula]. Note that, in this case, it must be [formula]

Finally, we may reformulate the preceding results in the following way:

Given an odd prime p it is easy to see that the number 2p - 1 must be [formula], i.e., it must be 2p - 1 = 3n or 2p - 1 = 3n + 1 so it is enough to consider the corresponding An.
