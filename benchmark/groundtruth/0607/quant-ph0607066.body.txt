Free electron in a laser field: The nonrelativistic solution

The exact solution of Dirac's equation for an electron in an external plane wave electromagnetic field was first obtained by Volkov [\cite=volkov] in 1935 and it's Green function was derived by Schwinger [\cite=schwinger]. The state of the charged particle, known as Volkov state, has been used extensively to explore numerous quantum phenomena such as Compton scattering, photo-ionization, bremsstrahlung processes and Kapitza-Dirac problem (scattering of an electron by a standing light wave), etc. However, an exact analytic solution of Schrodinger equation for a charged particle interacting with a plane wave electromagnetic field has never been obtained. The subject of the interaction of the charged particle with radiation is investigated using perturbation theory in almost any quantum mechanics textbooks. However, the behavior of a charged particle in the strong radiation fields by high-power laser can not be investigated by perturbation theory. To deal with this problem, new approximation methods have been developed [\cite=ek1] [\cite=ek11] [\cite=ros] [\cite=reiss] [\cite=gelt] [\cite=ek2] [\cite=ekle]. For example, in dipole approximation, electromagnetic field is assumed to be purely time-dependent for the study of ionization of atoms by intense laser pulses. In this approach, the magnetic field is neglected. As opposes to dipole approximation, the effect of magnetic field can be taken into account by expanding the potential to first order in the space coordinate. In this paper, we will solve exactly the Schrodinger equation for an electron in a linearly polarized monochromatic plane wave propagating in the z-direction. The vector potential is given by [formula]. The laser pulse with the elliptic polarization will be discussed later.

[formula]

where [formula]. To solve this equation, let us transform z- coordinate as s = z - ct. Then the time derivative operator transforms as [formula]. The equation ([\ref=1]) becomes

[formula]

where α is defined as [formula] and [formula]. We introduce the following ansatz; i.e. we look for the solution of ([\ref=21]) in the form

[formula]

where ε and [formula] are all constants. If we substitute ([\ref=3]) into the equation ([\ref=21]), we obtain

[formula]

Let us make a complex transformation on the coordinate as [formula]. This is reasonable since the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian. Using the transformation for the derivative operator [formula], the equation ([\ref=4]) becomes

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]. To solve ([\ref=6]), the last transformation is introduced as

[formula]

where [formula] is a constant to be determined later and L(u) is a function depending on u. If γ satisfies a polynomial equation [formula], then [formula] satisfies

[formula]

The solution is given in terms of the associated Laguerre functions [formula]. Note that a generalization of the associated Laguerre polynomial to not necessarily an integer is called the associated Laguerre function. Transforming backwards yields the exact solution

[formula]

To determine [formula] and γ, let us set the charge to zero [formula]. In this case, the free particle solution should be recovered. Note that Laguerre function is a number at zero and the constants can be omitted since the free particle solution isn't square integrable. To obtain the free particle solution, let us choose [formula]. Then, by solving the polynomial equation for γ, we get [formula]. Using the definition of δ, we obtain [formula]. Defining a new constant as [formula], the free particle solution is recovered. Physically, E is the energy for the free particle. Substituting [formula] in ([\ref=cozum]), we get

[formula]

This is the exact solution of Schrodinger equation with the plane wave electromagnetic field polarized in the x-direction. If we set α to zero, then it is reduced to the free particle solution. The first two terms in the exponential is the exact solution in the absence of the external field, the other two terms is due to the interaction with the field. The solution has been obtained for the linearly polarized electromagnetic field. If the field is elliptically polarized, then the term [formula] in Laguerre function should be replaced by the linear combination of [formula]. Finally, a few remarks about the solution ([\ref=cozum20]) is in order. Some approximations can be made for the associated Laguerre function [formula]. The order of σ is only comparable to the factor 1 / 2 when k  ≈  1011  ~  m- 1 (x-rays). Otherwise, one of them can be neglected. Furthermore, if [formula] is small compared to k, then this term can be neglected, too. As a special case, perturbative and our non-perturbative solutions should yield the same results. To check the validity of our result, let us compare the exact solution ([\ref=cozum20]) with the the one obtained by perturbation theory. Using the series expansion of associated Laguerre function [formula], where Γ is the gamma function, the wave function ([\ref=cozum20]) can be expanded in series up to order [formula] as

[formula]

where [formula],  [formula] . The constant in front of this expansion can be dropped from the solution since it is not physical. Having obtained the series expansion of the exact solution (9), let us review the perturbative expansion for the problem. Assuming α is small, perturbation theory states that Ψ can be approximated as

[formula]

where [formula] is the free particle solution. Substituting the equation ([\ref=perturbexpansion]) into the corresponding Schrodinger equation ([\ref=1]) yields  [formula] for the first order of α. Furthermore, for the second order [formula], we are left with the following equation  [formula]. By solving these two equations, we see that [formula] and [formula]. Then, it is concluded that our non-perturbative exact solution is in agrement with the solution obtained by using the perturbation theory. Perturbation theory fails when applying to the system with strong electromagnetic fields. In contrast, the solution ([\ref=cozum20]) is non-perturbative exact solution and it can be applied without restricting ourselves to the weak laser field. The non-perturbative exact solution obtained here can be used in many branches of physics. For example, the recent development of high power laser delivering pulses of intensity up to [formula] W/cm2 enables us to investigate deeply the properties of atoms, molecules, plasmas and condensed matter interacting with super intense laser pulses. With rising laser intensity, non-perturbative treatments are required to study the electronic motion of free and bound particles in intense laser fields. Analytical studies of strong laser atom interaction have seen much progress over the years [\cite=kfl] [\cite=hakem1] [\cite=hakem2] [\cite=duz1] [\cite=duz2]. A successful theory so called strong field approximation (SFA) was developed by Keldysh, Faisal and Reiss [\cite=kfl]. In SFA, the final state of the ionized electron is represented by Volkov solution which describes a free electron interacting with laser field. This is because laser field dominates Coulomb interaction. With this approximation, the physical phenomenons such as above-threshold ionization and high harmonic generation have been explained successfully. Exact solution for Coulomb field is well-known and given in terms of associated Laguerre polynomials. The exact solution for an electron interacting with radiation is given in the equation ([\ref=cozum20]). Thus, for the problem of atom-laser interaction, either field dominates the other can be treated perturbatively. The dipole approximation is often be employed in atomic physics. If the Bohr radius [formula] is very smaller than the wavelength of the radiation [formula], then the phase can be approximated as ωt - kz  ≈  ωt. The consequence is that the magnetic field is neglected, since magnetic field is given by [formula]. If the laser field is sufficiently intense, then a fully relativistic treatment for the dynamics of the electrons is required. Since the wave length is not small, the dipole approximation fails for the intense laser fields. As it was discussed in [\cite=enson], there is, however, an intensity region intermediate between the nonrelativistic and relativistic domain. The force on a charged particle due to the magnetic field is related to [formula]. This can be seen from the Lorentz force formula [formula]. True relativistic effects, however, are [formula] effects. Hence, there is an intermediate region where the dipole approximation is no longer valid and the relativistic treatment is not necessary. In this region, the particle is described by Schrodinger equation which includes all relativistic effects of order v / c. Some methods have been developed to understand the dynamics of laser-matter interaction in this region [\cite=enson] [\cite=enson2] [\cite=enson3] [\cite=enson4] [\cite=enson5]. The exact solution obtained here can also be used for the domain where v / c but not v2 / c2 are necessary. Finally, we think that the analysis of high harmonic generation [\cite=HHG] [\cite=HHG2] can be performed more accurately by using the exact solution ([\ref=cozum20]).
