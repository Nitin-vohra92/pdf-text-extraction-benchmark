Quantum fluctuations of braneworld background versus the TeV fundamental scale

The idea of large extra dimensions proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali [\cite=ADD] attracted considerable continuing interest over the past several years. If the fundamental scale of gravity is indeed in the TeV range, one expects that extra dimensions should start to show up in accelerator and astrophysical experiments at energies approaching this scale [\cite=ADD1]. The lowering of fundamental gravity scale to the TeV range opens up new possibilities for the black hole physics as well. Namely, it gives rise to a intriguing possibility of TeV scale black hole production at the near-future accelerators as well as in high energy cosmic ray experiments [\cite=DLGTFS]. In this paper we notice that in phenomenological braneworld models quantum fluctuations of background space-time become discouragingly enlarged due to setting the fundamental scale much below the Planck one. For definiteness let us indicate that the quantum fluctuations we deal with have different character relative to the standard perturbation field with respect to the background metric for which the theoretical framework describing the dynamics is well established. The point is that there is an unavoidable quantum uncertainty in space-time measurement that naturally translates into the metric fluctuations [\cite=SW]. In what follows we will be concerned with uncertainties due to quantum fluctuations of the background metric, in other words fluctuations that are introduced when a measurement is performed.

First let us briefly recapitulate the results concerning the issue of quantum fluctuations of the background Minkovskian space. In what follows we adopt the units [formula]. The minimal uncertainty in length measurement has the following form [\cite=Ma]

[formula]

where n denotes the number of extra dimensions, lF stands for fundamental length scale and

[formula]

(For n = 0 the fundamental length equals the Planck one lPl  ~  10- 33cm). The Eq.([\ref=uncleng]) exhibits the minimal observable length comparable to ~  lF. The minimal uncertainty in time measurement, δtmin, can be obtained from Eq.([\ref=uncleng]) simply by replacing lF and l with tF and t respectively. Since the first term in Eq.([\ref=uncleng]) is much greater than the second one for l  ≫  lF and they become comparable at l  ~  lF, one can say with no loss of generality that for [formula] our precision of space-time measurement is limited by the measurement process itself such that

[formula]

where α = (2 + n) / (3 + n). Correspondingly for background metric fluctuations over a region with linear size l one gets

[formula]

The metric fluctuations, δgμν, result in the energy-momentum uncertainties as well. Namely, the particle with momentum p has the wavelength λ where λ  ~  p- 1 and from the above relation for length uncertainty one simply gets

[formula]

The consideration of space-time uncertainties can be immediately generalized to the braneworld scenario [\cite=Ma] [\cite=Ma1]. Let us consider the ADD braneworld model with extra dimensions running from 0 to 2πL where the points 0 and 2πL are identified [\cite=ADD]. Without going into much details let us merely recall a few basic features relevant for our consideration. There is a low fundamental scale, mF  ~  TeV, the standard model particles are localized on the brane while the gravity is allowed to propagate throughout the higher dimensional space. Loosely speaking there is a length scale L beneath of which the gravitational interaction has the higher dimensional form due to contribution from KK gravitons whereas beyond this scale we have the standard four-dimensional law produced by the zero mode of KK spectrum

[formula]

The discussion of minimal length uncertainty goes as follows [\cite=Ma] [\cite=Ma1]. The distance measurement between two points is performed by sending the light signal from the clock to the mirror situated at those points respectively. As it is shown in [\cite=SW] by choosing the optimal size of the clock being of the order of [formula], the total uncertainty in distance measurement is reduced to the size of the clock. This quantity is bounded from below by the gravitational radius of the clock determining the minimal unavoidable uncertainty in length measurement [\cite=SW]. In order to take into account the uncertainties contributed to the measurement both by the clock and the mirror, one can use the gedanken experiment proposed in [\cite=Ma]. The brane localized observer using a clock with rs  <  L and measuring a distance l < L finds the Eq.([\ref=uncleng]) for minimal length uncertainty. In the case if l is greater than L but the size of clock is still less than L the second term in Eq.([\ref=uncleng]) appears with n = 0 and lF  →  lPl. If the size of clock is greater than L one gets the Eq.([\ref=uncleng]) with n = 0 and lF  →  lPl, i.e., the pure four-dimensional result. Strictly speaking the transition of higher-dimensional gravity from the region r  ≪  L to the four-dimensional law for r  ≫  L is more complicated near the transition scale ~  L than it is schematically described in Eq.([\ref=potential]), but for the purposes of this paper it is less significant. Let us notice that in the case of brane there are additional uncertainties in space-time measurements caused by the brane width [\cite=Ma2].

For favorable clock mass providing the minimal uncertainty in measuring the distance l one finds [\cite=Ma1]

[formula]

and correspondingly its gravitational radius takes the form

[formula]

Hence, for the region with linear size l beneath the scale

[formula]

the uncertainties in space-time intervals are given by Eq.([\ref=stuncert]). So that if the particle probes the length scale less than h, i.e. [formula] its energy-momentum uncertainty takes the form given by Eq.([\ref=emuncert]). Postulating the TeV fundamental scale in ADD model one finds L  ~  1030 / n - 17cm [\cite=ADD]. Correspondingly one gets n = 2 ~ , ~ h  ~  1054cm; n = 3 ~ , ~ h  ~  1022cm; n = 4 ~ , ~ h  ~  1030cm; n = 5 ~ , ~ h  ~  1024cm; n = 6 ~ , ~ h  ~  1020cm.

From Eq.([\ref=emuncert]) one sees that for the particle with the mass m  ≪  mF and energy E  ~  mF, the uncertainty in energy becomes comparable to the energy itself. So that the quantum fluctuations of space-time become unacceptable amplified in this case even for the TeV scale physics. For ultra high energy cosmic rays with E  ~  108TeV the uncertainty in energy becomes greater than 1013TeV. Hence, the ultra high energy cosmic rays put the restriction on the fundamental scale [formula]TeV. The discouragingly amplified uncertainties in energy-momentum can be seen in a more simple way as well. The brane localized particle with momentum grater than L- 1, (L- 1  ≪  TeV ) probes the length scale beneath L, the gravitational law for which is higher-dimensional and therefore in this case the Eq.([\ref=emuncert]) is directly applicable. As it is briefly emphasized in [\cite=Ma], in order to see the unacceptable magnification of these fluctuations one can consider them in light of stellar interferometry observations as well [\cite=LH] [\cite=RTG].

Now let us consider the effect of space-time fluctuations on the black hole production and subsequent evaporation. For the emission temperature and entropy of higher-dimensional black hole one finds [\cite=DLGTFS]

[formula]

Due to length uncertainty, Eq.([\ref=stuncert]), the horizon of the black hole undergoes the quantum fluctuations (at least) of the order δrg  ~  lαFr1 - αg resulting thereby in the fluctuations of black hole thermodynamics

[formula]

The cross-section of the black hole production is proportional to the square of the horizon area [\cite=DLGTFS] σ  ~  r2g and therefore undergoes fluctuations of the order

[formula]

Near the fundamental scale the fluctuations δT, ~ δS, ~ δσ, become of the same order as T, ~ S, ~ σ, and therefore does not allow one to say something definitely about the production and subsequent evaporation of mini black holes. When the brane localized black hole has evaporated down to the fundamental length size, the standard thermodynamic theory of the black hole is no longer applicable, as space-time is subject to violent quantum fluctuations on this scale.

In general when rg  ≫  δrg, i.e., rαg  ≫  lαF, the temperature, entropy and production cross section of the black hole undergo fluctuations given by

[formula]

We see that in ADD braneworld model with TeV fundamental scale the foamy structure of space-time shows up at energies approaching this scale threatening therefore the TeV scale physics. One can protect the model from these amplified fluctuations by increasing accordingly the mass gap between the zero and first excited KK graviton modes while keeping the fundamental scale into the TeV range. As it is shown in paper [\cite=Di] such result can be obtained by means of the compactification geometry associated with extra dimensions. Namely, the degree to which the Planck scale may be lowered depends on the volume of compactified dimensions. However, the shape moduli of extra space can have significant effect on the corresponding KK spectrum. For certain shape moduli it is possible to maintain the ratio between the higher-dimensional fundamental scale and the Planck one while simultaneously increasing the KK graviton mass gap by an arbitrary large factor. Such KK masses completely avoid direct laboratory bounds from precision tests of non-Newtonian gravity and alleviate (and perhaps even eliminate) many of the bounds that constrain theories with large extra dimensions considered in [\cite=ADD1] and multitudinous subsiquent papers. In most previous discussions of large extra dimensions little attention has been paid to the implications of shape moduli. But the above consideration makes it mandatory to protect the model from quantum fluctuations of background space-time and shape moduli seems to be one of the most natural protecting mechanisms. The above discussion illustrates a general feature of the quantum fluctuations of braneworld background irrespectively of the concrete model. Unfortunately, we don't know what can be the possible protecting mechanism from these fluctuations in the case of braneworld models with TeV fundamental scale and without compactified extra dimensions.
