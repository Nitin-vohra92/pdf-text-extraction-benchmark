Introduction

Evidence for neutrino oscillations obtained in the Super-Kamiokande [\cite=SK], SNO [\cite=SNO], KamLAND [\cite=Kamland] and other neutrino experiments [\cite=Cl] is one of the most important recent discovery in particle physics. There is no natural explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses in the Standard Model. A new, beyond the Standard Model mechanism of the generation of neutrino masses is necessary in order to explain experimental data. In this talk we will discuss: I. Basics of neutrino mixing and neutrino oscillations. II. Evidence for neutrino oscillations. III. Open problems and future perspective.

Basics of neutrino mixing and oscillations

There are three basic ingredients in the theory of neutrino oscillations: neutrino interaction, neutrino mass term, neutrino transition probabilities.

Neutrino interaction is well known. All existing experimental data are perfectly described by Lagrangians of the charged current and neutral current interactions of the Standard Model:

[formula]

Here

[formula]

are leptonic charged current and neutrino neutral current, g is SU(2) gauge constant and θW is the weak angle.

Neutrino mass term determines neutrino masses, neutrino mixing and nature of massive neutrinos. For neutrinos, particles with electric charge equal to zero, there are two general possibilities for the mass terms (see, for example, [\cite=BGG])

I. Majorana mass term

Let us introduce column of the left-handed fields

[formula]

The fields νsL do not enter into the Lagrangians of the standard CC and NC interaction ([\ref=1]). By this reason they are called sterile fields. The conjugated column

[formula]

is right-handed column. The most general Majorana mass term has the form

[formula]

where [formula] is a symmetrical, complex matrix. We have

[formula]

where U is an unitary matrix and mik = mk  ~  δik, ~ mk > 0. From ([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=6]) for the mass term we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

From ([\ref=8]) we have

[formula]

where ns is the number of the sterile fields. Thus, νi is the field of Majorana neutrinos with mass mi. From ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=8]) for the mixing we have

[formula]

II. Dirac mass term

We will introduce now columns of independent left-handed and right-handed fields

[formula]

The most general Dirac neutrino mass term has the form

[formula]

Complex matrix [formula] can be presented in the form

[formula]

where V and U are unitary matrices and mik = mk  ~  δik, ~ mk > 0. From ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=13]) for the Dirac mass term we find

[formula]

where

[formula]

From ([\ref=14]) and ([\ref=15]) it follows that νk(x) is the Dirac field of neutrinos (L = 1) and antineutrinos (L =  - 1) (L is the conserved total lepton number). From ([\ref=15]) for the neutrino mixing we will obtain Eq. ([\ref=10]) in which νk is the field of the Dirac neutrino with mass mk.

Type of the neutrino mass term at present is unknown. We will mention here only that in the case of the most popular see-saw mechanism of neutrino mass generation neutrino mass term is given by ([\ref=5]) with νs1 = (νeR)c, νs2 = (νμR)c and νs3 = (ντR)c. It is called Dirac and Majorana mass term and is a sum of left-handed and right-handed Majorana and Dirac mass terms for three left-handed and right-handed neutrino fields. If left-handed Majorana matrix is equal to zero and right-handed Majorana matrix is much larger than Dirac mass matrix in this case massive neutrinos are Majorana particles with masses which are much smaller than masses of leptons or quarks.

We will consider now transitions of flavor neutrinos in vacuum. The state of flavor neutrino νl with momentum [formula] produced in a CC weak process together with l+ is given by coherent superposition of states of neutrinos with different masses |νi〉 (see [\cite=BGG]):

[formula]

After time t for neutrino state we have

[formula]

where Δm2ik = m2k - m2i. Neutrinos are detected via observation of CC and NC processes in which flavor neutrinos νl take part. Existing neutrino oscillation data are described by the minimal scheme of the three-neutrino mixing. In the case ns = 0 from ([\ref=17]) we find

[formula]

From this expression for the probability of the transition νl  →  νl' we find the following standard expression

[formula]

where L≃t is the distance between neutrino production and detection points. Transition probabilities depend on six parameters (two neutrino mass-squared differences Δm212 and Δm223, three mixing angles θ12, θ23 and θ13 and one CP phase δ) and have rather complicated form. However, two parameters are small:

[formula]

In the leading approximation in which contribution of small parameters is neglected, neutrino oscillations are described by simple two-neutrino expressions [\cite=BGG]. In fact, let us consider atmospheric and long baseline accelerator experiments with [formula] Neglecting contribution of small quantities [formula] and sin 2θ13 we can see that that dominant oscillations in atmospheric region of [formula] are [formula]. The probability of νμ to survive is given by the standard two-neutrino expression

[formula]

which depend only on two oscillation parameters sin 22θ23 and Δm223.

Let us consider now the reactor KamLAND experiment and solar neutrino experiments. For these experiments small Δm212 is relevant and the contribution to the transition probabilities of "large" Δm223 is averaged. Neglecting sin 2θ13 for e  →  e survival probability in vacuum (the KamLAND experiment) we find the following expression

[formula]

For solar neutrinos MSW matter effect must be taken into account. Neglecting the contribution of sin 2θ13 we will find that νe  →  νe transition probability is given by two-neutrino expression

[formula]

where ρe is electron number density. Thus, in the leading approximation decoupling of oscillations in atmospheric-LBL and solar-KamLAND regions takes place. Existing experimental data are in agreement with such a picture of neutrino oscillations.

Evidence for neutrino oscillations

First model independent evidence for neutrino oscillations was obtained in the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment [\cite=SK]. In this experiment atmospheric νe and νμ are detected in the large 50 kt water Cherenkov detector. If there are no neutrino oscillations the number of electron and muon events must satisfy the following relation

[formula]

Here θ is zenith angle. Significant violation of this symmetry relation was observed in the case of high-energy muon events. For the ratio of the total number U of up-going muons ([formula] km) and total number D of the down-going muons ([formula] km) it was found

[formula]

In the Super-Kamiokande experiment [formula] dependence of the νμ survival probability was measured. From ([\ref=21]) it follows that the survival probability has first minimum at [formula] This minimum was clearly demonstrated by the data.. From analysis of the Super-Kamiokande data the following 90 % CL ranges of the oscillation parameters were found

[formula]

For the best-fit values of the parameters it was obtained:

[formula]

The evidence for νμ disappearance, obtained in the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment, was confirmed by accelerator K2K [\cite=K2K] and MINOS [\cite=Minos] experiments. In the K2K experiment νμ's produced at the KEK accelerator are detected by the Super-Kamiokande detector at the distance of about 250 km. 112 νμ events were observed in the experiment. In the case of no neutrino oscillations 158.1+ 9.2- 8.6 events were expected. From analysis of the K2K results for the best-fit values of the oscillation parameters it was found the values

[formula]

which are compatible with the Super-Kamiokande 90 % CL ranges ([\ref=26]).

In the MINOS long-baseline accelerator experiment (Fermilab-Soudan, 730 km) the number of expected νμ  +  μ events is 298  ±  15. The number of observed events is equal to 204. From analysis of the data the following best-fit values of the oscillation parameters were obtained

[formula]

In all solar neutrino experiments ( Homestake, GALLEX-GNO, SAGE and Super-Kamiokande [\cite=Cl]) observed rates are 2-3 times smaller than the rates predicted by the SSM[\cite=SSM]. Model independent evidence for neutrino oscillations was obtained in the solar SNO experiment [\cite=SNO]. In this experiment solar neutrinos are detected via the observation of three reactions

[formula]

From the measurement of the CC rate the flux of the solar νe on the earth can be inferred. From the measurement of the NC rate the flux of all active neutrinos νe, νμ and ντ can be determined. In the SNO experiment it was obtained

[formula]

The flux of νe on the earth is about three times smaller than the total flux of νe, νμ and ντ :

[formula]

Thus, it was proved by the SNO experiment that the solar νe's on the way from the sun to the earth are transformed into νμ and ντ.

The total flux of νe, νμ and ντ, measured by the SNO experiment, is in agreement with the flux predicted by SSM [\cite=SSM]:

[formula]

Model independent evidence for neutrino oscillations was found in the reactor KamLAND experiment. In this experiments e's from 53 reactors in Japan are detected via the observation of the reaction e + p  →  e+ + n by a detector in the Kamiokande mine. Average distance from reactors to the detector is about 170 km. The experiment is sensitive to Δm212 and sin 2θ12. The expected (without oscillations) number of the events in the KamLAND experiment is 365.2  ±  23.7. The observed number of the events is 258. The ratio of the observed and expected events is equal to R = 0.658  ±  0.044  ±  0.047. Significant distortion of the spectrum of positrons produced in the reaction e + p  →  e+ + n was observed in the KamLAND experiment. From global analysis of solar and KamLAND data for neutrino oscillation parameters it was found the values

[formula]

Summarizing, model independent evidence for neutrino oscillations driven by small neutrino masses and neutrino mixing were obtained in neutrino experiments. All data (except LSND) are in agreement with the three-neutrino mixing. Four neutrino oscillation parameters are determined from analysis of oscillation data with approximate accuracies:

[formula]

For the parameter sin 2θ13 only CHOOZ bound ([formula]) exists. The CP phase δ is unknown.

Future perspectives

For further progress the following basic questions must be answered:

I. Are neutrinos with definite mass Majorana or Dirac particles?

The most sensitive way to study the nature of massive neutrinos is the search for neutrinoless double β decay

[formula]

of 76, 130, 136, 100 and other even-even nuclei. The matrix element of 0νββ-decay is proportional to the effective Majorana mass [formula].

From the best existing lower bounds on the half-lives of the 0νββ-decay

[formula]

for the effective Majorana mass the following bounds |mββ|  ≤  (0.2 - 1.2)    ~   can be inferred. Many new experiments on the search for 0νββ-decay (CUORE, GERDA, EXO, MAJORANA and others) are now in preparation [\cite=Elliot]. The goal of the future experiments is to reach the sensitivity |mββ|≃   ~ 10- 2  ~  .

II. What is the value of the lightest neutrino mass m0?

From the measurement of the β-spectrum of 3 in Mainz and Troitsk experiments [\cite=Mainz] [\cite=Troitsk] it was obtained m0  <  2.3 eV. In the future KATRIN experiment [\cite=Katrin] the sensitivity m0≃0.2 eV is planned to be reached.

From cosmological data for the sum of the neutrino masses it was found the range [formula] eV. The future data will be sensitive to [formula] eV (see [\cite=Dodelson])

II. What is the value of the parameter sin 2θ13?

If the value of this parameter is not too small it will be possible to study such fundamental effects of the three neutrino mixing as CP violation in the lepton sector and to reveal the character of neutrino mass spectrum. The existing neutrino oscillation data are compatible with two types of neutrino mass spectra: m1  <  m2  <  m3; ~ Δm212  ≪  Δm223 (normal spectrum) and m3  <  m1  <  m2; ~ Δm212  ≪  |Δm213| (inverted spectrum). New reactor experiments DOUBLE CHOOZ and Daya Bay [\cite=2Chooz] are in preparation at present. In these experiments, correspondingly, factor 10 and 20 improvement in the sensitivity to sin 2θ13 is expected. In the accelerator T2K [\cite=T2K] experiment sensitivity to sin 2θ13 will be about 25 times better than in the CHOOZ experiment. Future neutrino facilities (Super beam, β -beam, Neutrino factory [\cite=Nfactory]) will allow to study phenomenon of neutrino oscillations with very high precision. There is no doubts that the accomplishment of this experimental program will be crucial for understanding of the origin of neutrino masses and mixing.
