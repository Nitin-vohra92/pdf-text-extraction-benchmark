Black Holes on Eguchi-Hanson Space in Five-Dimensional Einstein-Maxwell Theory

In this brief report, we construct a pair of black holes on the Eguchi-Hanson space as a solution in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. The metric and the gauge potential one-form are given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

where a and mj ~ (j = 1,2) are constants, 0  ≤    ≤  π, ~ 0  ≤  φ̃  ≤  2π / n, ~ (n:) and 0  ≤  ψ̃  ≤  2π.

The equation ([\ref=metric_EH]) is the metric form of the Eguchi-Hanson space[\cite=Eguchi]. The Eguchi-Hanson space has an S2-bolt at r = a, where the Killing vector field ∂  /  ∂ψ̃ vanishes. The function H(r,) is a harmonics on the Eguchi-Hanson space ([\ref=metric_EH]).

As is seen later, two black holes are located on the north pole ( = 0) and the south pole (  =  π) on the S2-bolt. The asymptotic behaviour of the metric ([\ref=metric_BH]) near the spatial infinity r  →    ∞   becomes

[formula]

Since the T = const. surface has the structure of lens space L(2n;1), this solution is asymptotically locally flat. The Komar mass, MKomar and the total electric charge, Q at the spatial infinity are given by

[formula]

where G is the five-dimensional gravitational constant.

In order to clarify the physical properties of the solution, we introduce the coordinates as follows [\cite=Prasad],

[formula]

Then, the metric takes the form of

[formula]

with

[formula]

where [formula] is the position vector on the three-dimensional Euclid space and [formula], [formula]. The metric ([\ref=metric_GH]) is the Gibbons-Hawking two-center form of the Eguchi-Hanson space[\cite=GH] [\cite=Prasad]. It is manifest in the coordinate that the space has two nut singularities at [formula] where the Killing vector field ∂  /  ∂ψ vanishes.

The function H(R,θ) is the harmonics given by ([\ref=harmonics_EH]) on the Eguchi-Hanson space in the Gibbons-Hawking coordinates ([\ref=metric_GH]). The harmonics H(R,θ) converts nut singularities on the Eguchi-Hanson space to regular hypersurfaces in the total spacetime. Since each hypersurface [formula] becomes a Killing horizon with respect to the Killing vector field ∂  /  ∂T, and each three-dimensional section of them with T = const. has finite area, then the hypersurfaces [formula] are event horizons.

Since the Kretschmann invariant RμνρλRμνρλ has a finite value on each horizon, we see that the geometry on the horizons is regular. Even if one of mj (for an example m2) vanishes, which corresponds to a single black hole and a naked nut charge with the value a / 8, the horizon is regular. The spacetime is regular in the case of n = 1 but it has a nut singularity at [formula] in the case of n  ≥  2.

The induced metric on the spatial cross section of the j-th horizon is given by

[formula]

which is the lens space L(n;1). The geometry near horizons of this solution is similar to the multi-black hole solutions on the Gibbons-Hawking multi-instanton space[\cite=IMKT], but the asymptotic structures are different. Although both are asymptotically locally flat, the former is isotropic in four spatial dimensions while the latter has a compact dimension as same as Kaluza-Klein black holes discussed in Ref.[\cite=IMKT] [\cite=IM].
