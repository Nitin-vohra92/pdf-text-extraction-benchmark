A note on the paper by Bugeaud and Laurent "Minoration effective de la distance p-adique entre puissances de nombres algébriques"

Introduction

In 1939, Gel'fond[\cite=Gel] established a result concerning upper bounds for p-adic distance between two integral powers. This result has been refined by several papers such as Schinzel[\cite=Sch], Yu[\cite=Yu1] [\cite=Yu2] [\cite=Yu3] [\cite=Yu4] [\cite=Yu5], Bugeaud[\cite=Bug], and Bugeaud and Laurent[\cite=BL]. Our purpose is to improve a result in the last paper by noting that constants γj(j = 1,2) in [\cite=BL] can be replaced by 1, which allows us to omit the condition log Ai  ≥  ( log p) / D in [\cite=BL] by modifying some constants.

Denote a (p - 1)-th root of unity in [formula] by ζ. Let p be a prime and α1,α2 be integers not divisible by p. Let mi be integers satisfying [formula] for i = 1,2 and g be an integer satisfying [formula]. Let K  ≥  3,L  ≥  2, R1,R2,S1,S2 be nonnegative integers. Put R = R1 + R2 - 1,S = S1 + S2 - 1,N = KL. Let b1,b2 be positive integers with (b1,b2,p) = 1 and denote Suppose there exist congruence classes c1,c2 modulo g such that

[formula]

[formula]

If we have

[formula]

then

[formula]

A special case to which we can apply our version of Bugeaud-Laurent theorem is a problem of Fermat quotient. By a well-known theorem of Fermat, [formula] for any prime p and integer x relatively prime to p. However, it is unknown whether there exist infinitely many prime p such that [formula]. It seems to be intersting and important to search for a nontrivial upper bound for the exponent of p dividing xp - 1 - 1. This is equivalent to give a nontrivial estimate for the p-adic logarithm log pxp - 1. But already known results for linear forms in p-adic logarithms do not give it. As for results of Bugeaud and Laurent[\cite=BL], the condition log Ai  ≥  ( log p) / D renders the estimate trivial. But now we can overcome this obstacle using Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Our result is as follows.

If p is a prime and x,y are relatively prime integers, then

[formula]

If q is odd prime, then we have

[formula]

Moreover, we have

[formula]

Our argument is essentially the same as the argument of Bugeaud and Laurent[\cite=BL]. Indeed, all that we need is to make a very slight change in this paper.

Though this result is nontrivial, this seems to be far from best possible. Ridout[\cite=Rid] shows that there are only finitely many rational integers x such that vp(xp - 1 - 1)  ≥  (1 + ε)( log x) / ( log p) for any fixed prime p and positive ε. It is conjectured that vp(xp - 1 - 1)  ≥  3 occurs only finitely many times for any fixed integer x > 1.

The abc conjecture implies that for any ε > 0, the inequality vp(xp - 1 - 1)  ≥  1 + (1 + εp)( log x) / ( log p) occurs only finitely many times. We can even conjecture:

The inequality

[formula]

holds for any integer x > 1 and prime p except finitely many pairs (x,p). Furthermore, the inequality

[formula]

holds for any primes (q,p) except finitely many pairs (q,p).

We have a heuristic argument. Since[formula], we see that for any integer x0 not divisible by p, the values [formula] take each congruent class exactly once. Hence it is reasonable to assume the probability of [formula] is p- e + 1. Let e(x,p) be a function defined over nonnegative integers x and primes p. If [formula] converges, then we can expect that vp(xp - 1 - 1)  ≥  e(x,p) has only finitely many solutions in (x,p).

We can choose

[formula]

Then we see that

[formula]

and therefore the sum converges.

One of our purposes of obtaining an upper bound for the exponent of p dividing xp - 1 - 1 is an application for the study of problems involving the sum-of-divisors function.

Nagell[\cite=Nag] gives that vp(σ(qc))  ≤  vp(qp - 1 - 1) + vp(c + 1) for distinct primes p,q with q  ≠  2 and a positive integer c. Now Theorem [\ref=thm2] immidiately gives the following theorem.

If q is an odd prime, then we have

[formula]

Moreover, we have

[formula]

If we assume Conjecture [\ref=conj1], we have

[formula]

except only finitely many pairs (p,q).

We exhibit an application to the problem of perfect numbers. If [formula] is a perfect number with [formula] distinct primes, then ei  ≤  (pk - 1) / 2 by a well-known result of primitive prime factors. Hence [formula](for other finiteness results, see, for example, [\cite=Nie], [\cite=Pom], [\cite=Ymd1]). We can improve this upper bound using Theorem [\ref=thm3].

If σ(N) = αN with α = n / d and [formula] with [formula] distinct primes, then

[formula]

for some absolute constant C. Furthermore, if Conjecture [\ref=conj1] is true, then

[formula]

for some absolute constant C'.

We hope that our method will provide some systematical method to study arithmetic functions involving divisors.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

We begin by improving [\cite=BL]; we shall show that the term g in the error terms can be omitted.

Let K,L,R,S,g be integers ≥  1, m1,m2,c rational integers with (m1,m2,g) = 1. Write N = KL and [formula]. If [formula] are N pairs of integers satisfying

[formula]

for [formula], then

[formula]

where

[formula]

We shall only show the inequality concerning [formula]. The other inequality can be easily shown in a similar way. Write g' = (m2,g) and g'' = g / g'.

If R  ≥  g', then we can proceed as in the original lemma and our lemma follows observing that R + g' - 1  ≤  2(R - 1).

If R < g', then all rj must be equal to c' in the original lemma. Hence we have This proves the lemma.

In [\cite=BL], we can replace γj(j = 1,2) by one. This proves Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]

We write ai = ( log Ai) / ( log p) and choose real constants B,k,l satisfying B  ≥  ( log b) / ( log p), k,l > 0, and

[formula]

where

We set L,K,R1,R2,S1,S2 as follows:

[formula]

Proceeding as in [\cite=BL], we find that if the condition

[formula]

holds, then we have v(Λ) < N.

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm2], we apply this with g = b1 = b2 = p - 1, α1 = q, α2 = 2,3 according to whether p is odd or not, and each mi(i = 1,2) being an integer satisfying [formula]. We may assume that p > 2283, since otherwise the theorem follows from the trivial estimate. We begin by confirming that the choice (k,l,B) = (11.32,3,1.027) satisfies ([\ref=eq2a]).

Now [formula] and ε(K) in [\cite=BL] is smaller than 10- 30. Hence

[formula]

which assures that the choice B = 1.027 satisfies the condition B  ≥  ( log b) / ( log p). Since [formula], we succeeded to prove ([\ref=eq00]) under the condition ([\ref=eq2b]).

If the condition ([\ref=eq2b]) fails, then there exist rational integers c0,c1 such that the congruence [formula] has two solutions (r1,s1) and (r2,s2) in integers 0  ≤  r < R2,0  ≤  s < S2 satisfying ri - si = c1. We have r2 - r1 = s2 - s1 and therefore

[formula]

Let m0 = m1 - m2 and g0 be the residual order of q mod p. We can easily see that g0 divides r1 - r2 since [formula]. Hence R2  >   max {r1,r2}  ≥  g0. Now ([\ref=eq00]) follows from the trivial estimate

[formula]

([\ref=eq01]) and ([\ref=eq02]) immidiately follow from ([\ref=eq00]) by taking (x,y) as (2,q) and (3,2) respectively. This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm4]

In this section, we denote by [formula] absolute constants.

By Theorem [\ref=thm3], we have

[formula]

if pi is odd. Moreover, we have

[formula]

Thus we obtain

[formula]

Noting that N divides dαN and N is composed of pi(1  ≤  i  ≤  k), we see

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=eq08]).

We assume Conjecture [\ref=conj1]. Theorem [\ref=thm3] gives

[formula]

for any i,j. A similar argument to the first case, we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then, since

[formula]

by ([\ref=eq31]), we have

[formula]

Taking the logarithms of both sides, we have

[formula]

We observe that x  ≥  k2 implies k( log x) / x  ≤  2( log k) / k  ≤  2 / e. Hence

[formula]

Since [formula], we have

[formula]

This completes the proof.
