Introduction

According to [\cite=Ber] (and [\cite=Trn]) each (commutative) semigroup S embeds into the global semigroup Γ(G) over a suitable (abelian) group G. The global semigroup Γ(G) over G is the set of all non-empty subsets of G endowed with the semigroup operation (A,B)  ↦  AB = {ab:a∈A,  b∈B}. If G is a topological group, then the global semigroup Γ(G) contains a subsemigroup exp (G) consisting of all non-empty compact subsets of G and carrying a natural topology which makes it a topological semigroup. This is the Vietoris topology generated by the sub-base consisting of the sets

[formula]

where U runs over open subsets of S. Endowed with the Vietoris topology the semigroup exp (G) will be referred to as the hypersemigroup over G (because its underlying topological space is the hyperspace exp (G) of G, see [\cite=TZ]). The problem of detecting topological semigroups embeddable into the hypersemigroups over topological groups has been considered in the literature, see [\cite=Ber].

This problem was resolved in [\cite=BHr] for the class of Clifford compact topological semigroups: such a semigroup S embeds into the hypersemigroup over a topological group if and only if the set E of idempotents of S is a zero-dimensional commutative subsemigroup of S. This characterization implies the result of [\cite=BL] that the closed interval

Idempotents and invertible elements of the convolution semigroups

In this section we prove Proposition [\ref=pr1]. For each topological group G the semigroups P(G) and exp (G) are related via the map of the support. We recall that the support of a Radon measure μ∈P(G) is the closed subset

[formula]

of G. Let 2G denote the semigroup of all non-empty closed subsets of G endowed with the semigroup operation [formula]. By

[formula]

we denote the support map.

The following proposition is well-known, see (the proof of) Theorem 1.2.1 in [\cite=Heyer].

Let G be a topological group. For any measures μ,ν∈P(G) the following holds: [formula]. This means that the support map [formula] is a semigroup homomorphism.

We shall show that for any regular element μ of the convolution semigroup P(G) the support Sμ is compact and thus belongs to the subsemigroup exp (G) of 2G. First, we characterize idempotent measures on a topological group G.

A measure μ∈P(G) is called an idempotent measure if [formula]. In 1954 Wendel [\cite=Wen] proved that each idempotent measure on a compact topological group coincides with the Haar measure of some compact subgroup. Later, Wendel's result was generalized to locally compact groups by Pym [\cite=Pym] and to all topological groups by Tortrat [\cite=Tor]. By the Haar measure on a compact topological group G we understand the unique G-invariant probability measure on G. It is a classical result that such a measure exists and is unique. Thus we have the following characterization of idempotent measures on topological groups:

A probability Radon measure μ∈P(G) on a topological group G is an idempotent of the semigroup P(G) if and only if μ is the Haar measure of some compact subgroup of G.

We shall use this proposition to describe regular elements of the convolution semigroups. To this end we apply Proposition 4 of [\cite=BHr] that describes regular elements of the hypersemigroups over topological groups:

For a compact subset K∈ exp (G) of a topological group G the following assertions are equivalent:

K is a regular element of the semigroup exp (G);

K is uniquely invertible in exp (G);

K = Hx for some compact subgroup H of G and some x∈G.

A similar description of regular elements holds for the convolution semigroup:

For a measure μ∈P(G) on a topological group G the following assertions are equivalent:

μ is a regular element of the semigroup P(G);

μ uniquely invertible in P(G);

[formula] for some idempotent measure λ∈P(G) and some element x∈G.

Assume that μ is a regular element of P(G) and ν∈P(G) is a measure such that [formula]. The measure [formula], being an idempotent of P(G) coincides with the Haar measure λ on some compact subgroup H of G. It follows that [formula] and hence Sμ and Sν are compact subsets of the group G. Since [formula] is a semigroup homomorphism, we get [formula], which means that Sμ is a regular element of the semigroup exp (G) and hence Sμ  =  H̃x for some compact subgroup H̃ and some element x∈G according to Proposition [\ref=p4a].

We claim that H̃ = H. Indeed, [formula] implies that H  ⊂  H̃. Next, for any point y∈Sν we get

[formula]

which yields xy∈H̃ and finally H = H̃.

Next, we show that [formula], which is equivalent to [formula]. Observe that [formula]. Now the equality [formula] will follow as soon as we check that the measure [formula] is H-invariant. Take any point y∈H and note that

[formula]

which means that the measure [formula] on H is left-invariant. Since H possesses a unique left-invariant probability measure λ, we conclude that [formula].

Finally, we show that μ is uniquely invertible in P(G). It suffices to check that the measure ν is equal to x- 1  *  λ provided [formula]. For this just observe that Sν being a unique inverse of Sμ is equal to x- 1H. Then Sx * ν = xSν = xx- 1H. Finally, noticing that for every y∈H we get

[formula]

which means that x * ν is a right invariant measure on H. Since λ is the unique right-invariant measure on H we also get x * ν  =  λ and hence ν = x- 1  *  λ.

Given a semigroup S we denote the set of regular elements of S by [formula].

For any topological group G, the support map

[formula]

is a homeomorphism.

The preceding proposition implies that the map

[formula]

is bijective. In order to check the continuity of this map, we must prove that for any open set U  ⊂  G the preimages

[formula]

are open in P(G). The openness of [formula] follows from the observation that [formula] if and only if μ(U) > 0. To see that [formula] is open, fix any measure [formula] with [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=p4], [formula] for some compact subgroup H of G and some x∈G. The compactness of H allows us to find an open neighborhood V of the neutral element of G such that HV2HV- 2HV  ⊂  Ux- 1. Now consider the open neighborhood [formula] of the measure μ. We claim that [formula]. Indeed, given any measure ν∈W we can apply Proposition [\ref=p4] to find an idempotent measure λ and y∈G such that [formula]. Then [formula]. We claim that Sλ  ⊂  HVVH. Indeed, given an arbitrary point z∈Sλ use the Sλ-invariance of λ to conclude that λ(zHVxy- 1) = λ(HVxy- 1) > 1 / 2, which implies that the intersection [formula] is non-empty which yields z∈HVxy- 1(HVxy- 1)- 1 = HVVH. The inequality λ(HVxy- 1) > 1 / 2 implies that HVxy- 1 intersects Sλ and hence the set HVVH. Then y∈HV- 2HHVx and [formula], which implies that [formula]. This completes the proof of the continuity of the map [formula].

The proof of the continuity of the inverse map

[formula]

is even more involved. Assume that [formula] is discontinuous at some point [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=p4a], K0 is a coset of some compact subgroup of G. After a suitable shift, we can assume that K0 is a compact subgroup of G and then [formula] is the unique Haar measure on K0.

Since [formula] is discontinuous at K0, there is a neighborhood O(μ0)  ⊂  P(G) of μ0 such that [formula] for any neighborhood [formula] of K0 in [formula].

It it well-known that the topology of G is generated by the left uniform structure, which is generated by bounded left-invariant pseudometrics. Each bounded left-invariant pseudometric ρ on G induces a pseudometric [formula] on P(G) defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the map induced by the projection [formula] onto the ith coordinate. By [\cite=Ba2] or [\cite=Fe], the topology of the space P(G) is generated by the pseudometrics [formula] where ρ runs over all bounded left-invariant continuous pseudometrics on G.

Consequently, we can find a left-invariant continuous pseudometric ρ on G such that the neighborhood O(μ0) contains the ε0-ball B(μ0,ε0) = {μ∈P(G):(μ,μ0) < ε0} for some ε0 > 0. Replacing ρ by a larger left-invariant pseudometric, we can additionally assume that for the pseudometric space Gρ = (G,ρ) the map γ:Gρ  ×  Gρ  →  Gρ, γ:(x,y)  ↦  xy- 1, is continuous at each point (x,y)∈K0  ×  K0 (this follows from the fact that for each continuous left-invariant pseudometric ρ1 on G we can find a continuous left-invariant pseudometric ρ2 on G such that the map γ:Gρ2  ×  Gρ2  →  Gρ1 is continuous at points of the compact subset K0  ×  K0).

The continuity and the left-invariance of the pseudometric ρ implies that the set G0  =  {x∈G:ρ(x,1) = 0} is a closed subgroup of G. Let G' = {xG0:x∈G} be the left coset space of G by G0 and q:G  →  G', q:x  ↦  xG0, be the quotient projection. The space G' = G / G0 will be considered as a G-space endowed with the natural left action of the group G. The pseudometric ρ induces a continuous left-invariant metric ρ' on G' such that ρ(x,y) = ρ'(q(x),q(y)) for all x,y∈G. So, q:(G,ρ)  →  (G',ρ') is an isometry. The pseudometrics ρ and ρ' induce the Hausdorff pseudometrics ρH and ρH' on the hyperspaces exp (G) and exp (G') such that the map exp q: exp (G)  →   exp (G') is an isometry. Also these pseudometrics induce the pseudometrics [formula] and ' on the spaces of measures P(G), P(G') such that the map Pq:(P(G),)  →  (P(G'),') is an isometry. The continuity of the map γ:G2ρ  →  Gρ at K20 implies that (K0,ρ) is a (not necessarily separated) topological group, [formula] is a closed normal subgroup of K0 and hence [formula] has the structure of topological group. Then μ'0 = Pq(μ0) is a Haar measure in K0'.

By the choice of the neighborhood O(μ0), for every [formula] we can find a compact set [formula] such that the measure [formula] does not belong to O(μ0). Then (μn,μ0)  ≥  ε0 by the choice of the pseudometric ρ.

For every [formula] let μn' = Pq(μn)∈P(G'), and K'n = q(Kn)∈ exp (G'). The convergence of the sequence (Kn) to K0 in the pseudometric space ( exp (G),ρH) implies the convergence of the sequence (K'n) to K'0 in the metric space ( exp (G'),ρ'H), which implies that the union [formula] is compact in the metric space (G',ρ'). Then the subspace P(K') is compact in the metric space (P(G),') and hence the sequence [formula] contains a subsequence that converges to some measure μ' in (P(G'),'). We lose no generality assuming that whole sequence [formula] converges to μ'. Since ε0  ≤  (μn,μ0) = '(μn',μ0'), we conclude that μ'  ≠  μ0'. We shall derive a contradiction (with the uniqueness of a left-invariant probability measure on compact groups) by showing that μ' is a left-invariant measure on K0', distinct from the Haar measure μ0'.

The '-convergence μn'  →  μ' and ρ'H-convergence [formula] imply that [formula] and thus μ' is a probability measure on the compact topological group K0'. It remains to check that the measure μ' is left-invariant. Assuming the converse, we can find a point a∈K0' such that a * μ'  ≠  μ' and thus ε  =  '(μ',a * μ') > 0. Since the map γ:Gρ  ×  Gρ  →  Gρ is continuous at each point (x,y)∈K0  ×  K0, we can find a positive [formula] so small that [formula] for any x,y∈K0 and x'∈G with ρ(x',x) < δ. Since ρH(Kn,K0)  →  0 and [formula], there is a number [formula] and a point an∈Kn such that ρ(a,an) < δ and '(μ'n,μ')  ≤  ε / 4. Consider two left shifts la:G  →  G, la:x  ↦  ax, and lan:G  →  G. The choice of δ guarantees that [formula]. Then

[formula]

The left shift lan:G  →  G, being an isometry of the pseudometric space (G,ρ), induces an isometry l'an:G'  →  G' of the metric space (G',ρ'), which induces the isometry Pl'an:P(G')  →  P(G') of the corresponding space of measures. So, [formula]. The compact set Kn, being a regular element of the semigroup exp (G) is equal to Hnxn for some compact subgroup Hn  ⊂  G and some point xn∈G according to Proposition [\ref=p4a]. Then [formula] is equal to λn * xn where λn is the Haar measure on the group Hn. Since λn is left-invariant, an  *  μn = an  *  λn * xn  =  λn * xn  =  μn and hence an  *  μn' = μ'n.

Now we see that

[formula]

which is a desired contradiction.

The following corollary establishes the first part of Proposition [\ref=pr1]. The second part of that proposition follows from Theorem 2 of [\cite=BHr].

Let G be a topological group. Then a topological regular semigroup S can be embedded into the hypersemigroup exp (G) if and only if S can be embedded into the convolution semigroup P(G).

If S  ⊂   exp (G) is a regular subsemigroup, then [formula] and [formula] is an isomorphic copy of S in P(G) according to Propositions [\ref=p5]. Conversely, if S  ⊂  P(G) is a regular subsemigroup, then its image [formula] is an isomorphic copy of S in exp (G).
