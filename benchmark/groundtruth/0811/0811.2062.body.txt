On Deriving a basis for the vector space of bounded qudit error operators over [formula]

Introduction

The theory of quantum computation continues to advance our understanding of information as established in the seminal work of Shannon (1948) through an innovative analysis of the nature of noise. This development of a quantum mechanical computing framework has redefined quantum computation and inspires discoveries whose very nature lie at the frontier of reality. Constructing a quantum computer is predicated on realising the inherent processing advantage of quantum computation over its classical analogue and on controlling the sensitive quantum interference effects that explain the source of its computational power. However, computations are taken in open quantum systems which produce unwanted interactions between sensitive quantum information and noise in the environment. It is this interaction that results in decoherence - an outcome that destroys quantum information. Unfortunately, decoherence is an inevitable feature of quantum computation, and therefore, it is of fundamental importance that any coupling between information and the environment be controlled. Therefore, to better understand the fundamentals of noise propagation is to understand the formalism of a model that explains it.

In this paper we construct a basis for the space of bounded operators acting on a d-dimensional quantum system [formula]. As an application, we generalise the qubit teleportation scheme.

Preliminaries

Given an arbitrary finite alphabet Σ of cardinality d, we process quantum information by specifying a state description of a finite dimension quantum space. In particular, the state description of the Hilbert space [formula]. While the state of an d-dimensional Hilbert space can be more generally expressed as a linear combination of basis states [formula], we write each orthonormal basis state of the d-dimensional Hilbert space [formula] to correspond with an element of [formula]. In this context the basis [formula] is referred to as the computational basis. Therefore, a state [formula] of [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. A qudit describes a state in the Hilbert space [formula]. The state space of an n-qudit state is the tensor product of the basis states of the single system [formula], written [formula], with corresponding orthonormal basis states given by

[formula]

where [formula]. The general state of a qudit in the Hilbert space H is then written

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].

An Error Model

The challenge of quantum information processing is to elicit a reliable form of communication and to maintain such a form in the presence of quantum noise. Noise is a characteristic of the environment associated with an information state and is a property of an open quantum system that subjects an information state to unwanted interactions with the elements of the environment during teleportation. It is inevitable that the communication of an information state will cause interactions with the environment. However, prolonged contact between the information state and environment is soon to suffer in entanglement that degrades the information state resulting in decoherence. Any strategy to stabilize quantum computations from the effects of noise will ultimately be required to deal with both the problems of decoherence and unitary imperfections of channel communication. To this end, we give the following description of error within the environment system.

Given a qudit information state [formula] of the Hilbert space [formula], let us consider an adjoined environment space [formula] endowed with an orthonormal basis of dimension d2. We suppose that both the state space of the qudit and the corresponding environment space are initially independent systems. The joint state of the systems [formula] and [formula] is then [formula] and its dynamics may be characterised when we further suppose that the joint system evolves according to some unitary operation. Given a unitary operation U, we write interaction of each basis qudit with the environment under U as

[formula]

for [formula]. By linearity of U, the dynamics of the joint system [formula] is then

[formula]

Since [formula] if z = 0 and vanishes otherwise then equation ([\ref=env]) may be written as

[formula]

[formula]

An outer product representation describes the set of operators that act on the joint quantum state under U. The operator [formula] maps [formula] to [formula] for [formula], and thus maps [formula] to [formula]. Similarly, [formula] maps [formula] to [formula] and correspondingly maps [formula] to [formula]. Both X1 and Z1 are called the Weyl Pair (Weyl (1931)). Consequently, the action of U on [formula] is described by the set of operators [formula] [formula],

[formula]

Thus, to correctly specify an error model that describes the action of a unitary operator U on the joint space [formula], it is necessary that the environment [formula], associated with an information state in [formula], be a Hilbert space of dimension d2. Following the action of U on the joint system, a measurement on the environment is performed with respect to the basis [formula] to diagnose the introduced error in result ([\ref=XZ]). Therefore, equation ([\ref=XZ]) provides the conceptual foundation of quantum error correction. Measurements taken in the environment basis initiate the correction step (XmZn)- 1  =  Z( - n  d)X( - m  d).

We now show that the set [formula] (X0Z0  =  I) constitutes a basis for the space of bounded operators on [formula]. As such, the set [formula] forms a d2-dimensional Lie algebra with a d  ×  d matrix representation defined by the matrices with entries Xm,n  =  δm,n - l( d), Zm,n  =  ωmkδm,n.

Denote by ω the primitive dth root of unity. Let us consider [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] is a basis for the space of bounded operators acting on [formula].

Proof: To show that elements of E are linearly independent and span [formula], it suffices to show that the basis [formula], on [formula] may be expanded as a linear combination of elements in E as both sets of operators are of size d2. Let us consider E in the [formula] basis as

[formula]

then [formula]. Suppose we may express [formula] as the linear combination [formula]. Then coefficient ξi,j is given by

[formula]

where δi,j is the Kronecker delta;

[formula]

We show that with ξij defined as these values then [formula] is in the span of E. Now,

[formula]

where [formula] has vanishing trace. Since

[formula]

as [formula], then [formula]. Hence, [formula] and the result follows.

Quantum Qudit Teleportation

We now consider the transmission of quantum information with respect to a quantum noisy channel where a full continuum of noise is maintained. While classical information can be transmitted and protected from the effects of noise by replication, quantum information cannot be copied with perfect fidelity (Dieks (1982), Wootters and Zurek (1982)). Introduced by Bennett et al. (1983), quantum teleportation is an experimental demonstration of the means by which quantum communication is made possible and purports a fundamental distinction between quantum and classical information theory. Such distinction is maintained by the Bell-EPR correlations whereby an essential nonlocality principle, described by quantum entanglement, is revealed. This result was demonstrated experimentally by Aspect et  al. (1982). Quantum teleportation takes advantage of the non-local behaviour of quantum mechanics by treating quantum entanglement as an information resource. While the Church-Turing Principle maintains that it is impossible to transmit quantum information by implementing a classical computation, Bennett et al. (1983) introduced quantum teleportation to overcome this limitation by developing a quantum algorithm that describes a complete communication transmission of quantum information. The first complete transmission of quantum information was performed by Nielsen et al. (1998). In the quantum teleportation protocol two parties A and B share a pair of particles in a maximally entangled state. If we suppose that A is presented with a quantum system in an unknown quantum state [formula] then A can make [formula] re-appear at B's location (see Fig. [\ref=re-appear]). Central to the protocol is the use of entanglement to transmit the quantum information of the unknown state between the parties. We now describe the protocol.

Quantum teleportation describes how two parties, A and B, process and communicate quantum information in a manner secure from the effects of error. Suppose A wishes to communicate the state [formula] then the goal of teleportation is to transmit that particular quantum information state to B. Further suppose that A prepares the qudit [formula] where [formula]. Similarly, B prepares the qudit [formula] where [formula]. In order to achieve teleportation, A must interact the information state [formula] with a two qudit entangled state, [formula]. The entangled state [formula] is called a generalised Bell state whereby A and B each possess one qudit of this two qudit state. To construct a generalised Bell state [formula], we first apply the Fourier transform [formula] to the qudit [formula]. This acts on basis states [formula] as follows [formula] where ω is a primitive [formula] root of unity in [formula] such that ωd  =  1 and ωt  ≠  1 for all 0 < t < d. Secondly, we follow the Fourier transform by the controlled-NOT operation given by [formula] for all basis states [formula] which maps the two qudit state accordingly. Consequently, any pair of qudits [formula] from the d2 computational basis states of [formula] generate a generalised Bell state. In particular, applying the Fourier transform to the first half of the pair of qudit states [formula], we obtain,

[formula]

The action of the controlled-NOT operator on resulting state ([\ref=Fourier]) completes the generalised Bell state construction

[formula]

Since the Bell pair is an entangled state Nielsen and Chuang (2000), any operator acting on the first qudit held by A influences the state of the second qudit held by B. This condition permits the teleportation of the quantum information state [formula] between parties A and B when A interacts [formula] with the first half of the generalised Bell pair ([\ref=betaAB]). To negate the effects of the Bell state transformations on [formula], thereby allowing the teleportation of [formula], A transforms [formula] by applying the inverse of the generalised controlled-NOT operator for qudit states which is then followed by an application of the inverse Fourier transform. Now, the Fourier transform is unitary so its inverse is its adjoint, and the inverse of the generalised controlled-NOT operation has its action defined as [formula]. We write the state of the quantum system held by A and B, as

[formula]

A initiates teleportation of the quantum information state [formula] by applying the inverse generalised controlled-NOT operation between [formula] and the qudit of the generalised Bell state held by A, thereby obtaining,

[formula]

Following this result, A applies the discrete Fourier transformation on the first qudit of the state ([\ref=outcome]). The outcome of this operation is to place the state ([\ref=outcome]) into the state given by

[formula]

[formula]

The qudit of the generalised Bell state held by B is transformed into the state [formula]. Thus A has teleported a quantum information state [formula] to B, however, it has been subjected to error over the channel and therefore B receives [formula] instead of [formula]. A measurement projection onto the computational basis state of [formula] is performed by A on the first and second qudit of the state of the quantum system ([\ref=tele]) which yields two classical numbers. Simultaneously, the third qudit of the state of the system ([\ref=tele]) teleported to B collapses to a post-measurement state that is dependent upon the measurement outcome obtained by A. Let M1,M2 be two classical numbers corresponding to the resulting states [formula]. Then the state of the qudit held by B is given by [formula]. The set M1,M2 is transferred by classical means to B, where upon delivery B learns which of the generalised Pauli operators are required to correct the effect of the error. In particular, B applies the operators

[formula]

and

[formula]

in order to return the post-measurement state [formula] to the initial quantum information state [formula]. Hence, applying X-  B - M2 to the post-measurement state, B obtains

[formula]

[formula]

The operator Z-  A - M1 is then applied by B on result ([\ref=X]) returning the post-measurement state to the quantum information state initially held by A,

[formula]

This ends the teleportation protocol - the state of B's system is left in the same state as the one initially presented to A. The quantum information can only be obtained if it vanishes from A thereby upholding the no-cloning theorem (Dieks (1982), Wootters and Zurek (1982)). Thus B obtains the quantum information which A wished to transmit. This is what it means for the quantum information to have been transmitted (Timpson (2006)).
