Existence and uniqueness conditions of positive solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with double power nonlinearities

Introduction

We shall consider a boundary value problem

[formula]

where [formula] and The above problem arises in the study of

[formula]

Indeed, the classical work of Gidas, Ni and Nirenberg [\cite=G1] [\cite=G2] tells us that any positive solution to [\eqref=a] is radially symmetric. On the other hand, for a solution u(r) of [\eqref=b], [formula] is a solution to [\eqref=a].

The condition to assure the existence of positive solutions to [\eqref=a] (and so [\eqref=b]) was given by Berestycki and Lions [\cite=B1] and Berestycki, Lions and Peletier [\cite=B2]:

Uniqueness of positive solutions to [\eqref=b] had long remained unknown. Finally in 1998 Ouyang and Shi [\cite=OS] proved uniqueness for [\eqref=b] with f satisfying the additional condition (See also Kwong and Zhang [\cite=KZ]):

In the present paper we find the equivalent conditions of these. Following is the main result of the present paper:

As a corollary of the Theorem [\ref=thm] above we have a simpler proof of the result presented in the former paper that the existence condition asserts the uniqueness condition [\cite=Kawano2]:

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present the proof of the theorem [\ref=thm]. In section 3 we present a simpler proof of the corollary.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm].

The following two lemmas asserts the Theorem [\ref=thm].

The proofs of these Lemmas are nothing but straightforward calculation and shall be omited.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor].

From Theorem [\ref=thm] it is enough to show that if F has positive parts(the existence condition [\eqref=existence]) then f has positive parts(the condition [\eqref=uniquetilde]). The contraposition is clear by the monotonicity of the integral.
