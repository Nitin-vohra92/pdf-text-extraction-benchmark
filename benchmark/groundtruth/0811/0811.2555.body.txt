Solution of Partial Differential Equations by Method of Hyperholomorphic functions

Let [formula] be a finite-dimensional commutative unitary algebra over [formula] (or [formula]), a set of vectors [formula] be a basis of [formula], and [formula] be the unit of the algebra. Suppose [formula] is m-dimensional subspace of [formula] with the basis [formula], m  â‰¤  n. Consider a function [formula] of the following form

[formula]

where [formula] are real (or complex) functions of m + 1 arguments.

[formula] is called differentiable at a point [formula] if there exists the function [formula] such that for any [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] doesn't depend on [formula]

A function [formula] is said to be hyperholomorphic if [formula] is differentiable at every point of [formula].

A function [formula] is hyperholomorphic if and only if there exists the function [formula] such that for all [formula] and [formula]

[formula]

where [formula] doesn't depend on [formula]

Suppose that ([\ref=2]) is fulfilled, then it is easily verified that

[formula]

Consider [formula] It follows from Eqs.([\ref=3]) that

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

Furthermore, it follows from Eqs.([\ref=3]) that

[formula]

Therefore, for every [formula]

[formula]

or

[formula]

By using Eq.([\ref=3]), we have

[formula]

Eqs.([\ref=5]) will be called the Cauchy-Riemann type conditions. In paper [\cite=P] we studied hyperholomorphic functions [formula].

Solution of some differential equations

Let us consider the following partial differential equation

[formula]

where [formula] are constant coefficients.

Suppose that some subspace [formula] of algebra [formula] has a basis [formula] such that and a function [formula] [formula] is hyperholomorphic.

Then functions [formula], [formula] are solutions of Eq.([\ref=6]).

It follows from the Cauchy-Riemann condition ([\ref=5]) that This implies Therefore, we obtain

[formula]

In case where [formula] and [formula] are complex numbers a differentiable function is holomorphic. Basis [formula] satisfies the equation [formula]. Therefore, the real and imaginary parts of any holomorphic function satisfy the Laplace equation In paper [\cite=K] it is considered algebras which differentiable functions have harmonic components that satisfy the three-dimensional Laplace equation.
