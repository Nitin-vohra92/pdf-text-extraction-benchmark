Periodic elements of the free idempotent generated semigroup on a biordered set

The biordered set of a semigroup S is the set of idempotents of S considered as a partial groupoid with respect to the restriction of the multiplication of S to those pairs (e,f) of idempotents such that ef = e, ef = f, fe = f or fe = f. Nambooripad [\cite=Nam79] who has initiated an axiomatic approach to biordered sets has defined an abstract biordered set as a partial groupoid satisfying certain second order axioms. The first author [\cite=Eas85] has confirmed the adequacy of Nambooripad's axiomatization by showing that each abstract biordered set is in fact the biordered set of a suitable semigroup. Namely, if [formula] is an abstract biordered set, denote by IG(E) the semigroup with presentation

[formula]

The semigroup IG(E) is called the free idempotent generated semigroup on E. In [\cite=Eas85] it has been shown that the biordered set of IG(E) coincides with the initial biordered set [formula] (see Lemma [\ref=Easdown] below for a precise formulation of this result).

The structure of the free idempotent generated semigroup on a biordered set is not yet well understood. It was conjectured that subgroups of such a semigroup should be free. Though confirmed for some partial cases (see [\cite=McE02] [\cite=NP80] [\cite=Pas77] [\cite=Pas80]), this conjecture has been recently disproved by Brittenham, Margolis, and Meakin [\cite=BMM1] who have found a biordered set [formula] such that the semigroup IG(E) has the free abelian group of rank 2 among its subgroups. Moreover, in the subsequent paper [\cite=BMM2] the same authors have proved that if F is any field, and E3(F) is the biordered set of the monoid of all 3  ×  3 matrices over F, then the free idempotent generated semigroup over E3(F) has a subgroup isomorphic to the multiplicative group of F. In particular, letting F be the field of complex numbers, one concludes that the free idempotent generated semigroup on a biordered set can contain group elements of any finite order.

Recall that an element a of a semigroup S is said to be periodic if a generates a finite subsemigroup in S; in other words, if

[formula]

for some positive integers h and d. Given a, the least h and d verifying the equality [\eqref=index_and_period] are called respectively the index and the period of a. The aforementioned discovery by Brittenham, Margolis, and Meakin [\cite=BMM2] shows that there is no restriction to periods of periodic elements in the free idempotent generated semigroup on a biordered set. The main result of the present note demonstrates that, in contrast, indices of periodic elements in such a semigroup are severely restricted, namely, they must be equal to 1. In other words, we aim to show that every periodic element of IG(E) must belong to a subgroup of IG(E).

We assume the reader's familiarity with Green's relations [formula], [formula], [formula] and their basic properties that can be found in the early chapters of any general semigroup theory text. The following property is also elementary but perhaps less known.

Let S be a semigroup, a,e∈S, e2 = e, p,q positive integers where p  ≤  q. Then [formula] implies [formula].

Clearly, e = aq - pap∈S1ap. Since ap = eb for some b∈S1, we have

[formula]

Thus, ap∈S1e, whence [formula] and [formula].

We fix an arbitrary biordered set [formula]. Now let E+ be the free semigroup on E and φ:E+  →  IF(E) the onto morphism extending the identity map on E.

If w∈E+ and wφ is idempotent, then wφ = eφ for some e∈E.

This is the main result of [\cite=Eas85].

As usual, E* stands for E+ with the empty word 1 adjoined.

If w∈E+ and wφ = eφ for some e∈E, then there exist u,v∈E* and f∈E such that w = ufv and [formula].

Let σ  =   ker φ. Clearly, every two σ-related words in E+ can be connected by a sequence of elementary σ-transitions of the form xe1e2y  →  xe3y or xe3y  →  xe1e2y where x,y∈E*, e1,e2,e3∈E and [formula] in the biordered set [formula]. We induct on the minimum length n of such a sequence from w to e. If n = 0, that is w = e, the claim is obvious since we can set u = v = 1 and f = e. Suppose n > 0 and let w  →  w' be the first σ-transition in a sequence of minimum length connecting w and e. By the induction assumption, w' = u'f'v' for some u',v'∈E* and f'∈E such that [formula]. On the other hand, for some x,y∈E*, e1,e2,e3∈E, we have the decompositions w = xe1e2y, w' = xe3y (the contraction case) or w = xe3y, w' = xe1e2y (the expansion case).

Consider the contraction case. We have w' = xe3y = u'f'v'. First suppose that the distinguished occurrence of f' happens within the word x, that is x = u'f'x', v' = x'e3y for some x'∈E*:

=1.1mm

Then the word w = xe1e2y also decomposes as w = ufv where u = u', f = f', and v = x'e1e2y so that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

as required.

The situation when the distinguished occurrence of f' happens within the word y is handled in a symmetric way.

Now suppose that x = u', y = v' and e3 = f'. Then [formula] in the biordered set [formula]. By the definition of a biordered set, the product [formula] is defined if and only if either 1) [formula], or 2) [formula], or 3) [formula], or 4) [formula]. In Cases 1 and 3 set u = u' = x and v = e2y = e2v'. Then w = ue1v. Since [formula] and f'φ = (e1e2)φ, we have

[formula]

Under the condition of each of the cases under consideration, (e1e2e1)φ = e1φ whence [formula]. Multiplying the relation [formula] through on the right by e1φ, we get [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

as required. Cases 2 and 4 are dual.

Now consider the expansion case. We have w' = xe1e2y = u'f'v'. The situations when the distinguished occurrence of f' happens within x or y are completely similar to the analogous situations in the contraction case. Suppose that x = u', e1 = f' and e2y = v'. Then we set u = u' = x and v = y, whence w = ue3v. Since [formula], we have

[formula]

Multiplying the relation [formula] through on the right by e2φ, we obtain [formula]. On the other hand, from the relation

[formula]

we have e1φ = (e3v)φ  ·  s = e3φ  ·  (vφ  ·  s) for some s∈IG(E), and since e3φ = (e1e2)φ = e1φ  ·  e2φ, we conclude that [formula]. From this and from [\eqref=2] we get [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

as required. The situation when x = u'e1, e2 = f' and y = v' is handled in a symmetric way.

We are ready to state and to prove our main result.

Let [formula] be a biordered set, IG(E) the free idempotent generated semigroup on E. Every periodic element of IG(E) lies in a subgroup of IG(E).

Let [formula], where [formula], be a word in E+ such that wφ∈IF(E) is periodic. Then (wφ)k = wkφ is idempotent for some k, whence, by Lemma 2, wkφ = eφ for some e∈E. If k = 1, there is nothing to prove, so we suppose k > 1 and apply Lemma 3 to wk. It yields a decomposition of the form

[formula]

such that [formula], 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and

[formula]

Using Green's lemma, we deduce from [\eqref=1] the following relations:

[formula]

(The "initial" relations in [\eqref=1] are represented by the bold lines.) In particular, [formula]. Since [formula], we can apply Lemma 1 with a = wφ, [formula] and q = k, thus obtaining [formula]. Hence [formula] and the dual of Lemma 1 implies that [formula], that is, wφ belongs to a subgroup of IG(E).

Acknowledgement and a historical comment. The authors are very much indebted to Stuart Margolis for informing them about results of [\cite=BMM1] [\cite=BMM2] and stimulating discussions. In fact, the initial idea of this note arose in 1990 during the second and the third authors' visit to the University of Sydney. However, at that time it was not at all clear whether the free idempotent generated semigroup on a biordered set may have non-idempotent periodic elements, and publishing a result about objects that might not exist did not seem to be justified. It was not until very recently that the examples in [\cite=BMM2] have confirmed that our theorem has indeed a non-void applicability range.
