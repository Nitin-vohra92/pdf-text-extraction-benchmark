Spin-rotation coupling in non-exponential decay of hydrogenlike heavy ions

Recent experiments carried out at the storage ring ESR of GSI in Darmstadt [\cite=GSI] [\cite=geissel] reveal an oscillation in the orbital electron capture and subsequent decay of hydrogen-like [formula]Pr  58  + and [formula]Pm  60  +. The modulation has a period of 7.069(8)  s and 7.10(22)  s respectively in the laboratory frame and is superimposed on the expected exponential decay. The "zero hypothesis" of a pure exponential decay has been excluded at 99% C.L. for both ions. Equally improbable causes seem to be periodic instabilities in the storage ring and detection apparatus. The effect has been tentatively attributed to neutrino flavor mixing, but this interpretation presents difficulties that have been discussed in the literature [\cite=mixing].

It may be useful to analyze the effect of spin-rotation coupling on the ESR modulation effect. It is in fact the spin part of the Thomas precession, or spin-rotation coupling, that is responsible for a similar modulation in g - 2 experiments. The corresponding modulation in the detection of electrons produced in the in-flight decay of muons in storage rings yields the anomalous part of the muon magnetic moment directly [\cite=kinoshita].

An important point raised in work on [formula]Pr  58  + and [formula]Pm  60  + is that in the initial state these ions, with nuclear spin I = 1, and the bound electron can have total angular momentum 1 / 2 when the electrons and nucleus spins are antiparallel, or 3 / 2 when the spins are parallel. The final state, however, can only have spin 1/2 because decay from the spin 3 / 2 state is forbidden by the conservation of the F quantum number.

For the sake of simplicity, we treat the nuclei as spin-1 particles interacting with their single electron by an amount sufficient to drag it along the same cyclotron orbits in the storage ring. We use units [formula], but re-introduce standard units when discussing the results.

Following Bell and Leinaas [\cite=bell], we write the full Hamiltonian that describes the behavior of nucleus and bound electron in the external induction field [formula] of the ring as

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

H(e,n)0 contain all the usual standard terms (Coulomb potential, spin-orbit coupling, spin-spin coupling, etc.), ge and gn are the g-factors, and μB and μN are the Bohr and nuclear magnetons.

The Hamiltonians H(e) and H(n) contain the Pauli spin matrices via [formula] and the 3  ×  3 matrices [formula] and the last terms account for the Thomas precession. If the orbits in the ring are stable, the coupling of [formula] to the orbital angular momentum [formula] may be neglected [\cite=bell]. We will also neglect, for simplicity, any stray electric fields and electric fields needed to stabilize the orbits and all quantities in ([\ref=He]) and ([\ref=Hi]) will be taken to be time-independent.

One can also arrive at ([\ref=He]) and ([\ref=Hi]) starting from the Dirac equation [\cite=bell] [\cite=hehl] [\cite=pap] [\cite=singh] and the corresponding relativistic wave equation for spin-1 particles [\cite=pap]. The importance of spin-rotation coupling has also been greatly emphasized, in a different context, by Mashhoon [\cite=mash].

H(e)0 and H(n)0 contribute to the overall energy E(e) and E(n) of the states. By referring ([\ref=He]) and ([\ref=Hi]) to a left-handed tern of axes rotating about the x2-axis in the clockwise direction of the ions and with the x3-axis tangent to the ion orbit in the direction of its momentum [\cite=bell], we find that the operators governing the evolution of the spin states are

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Γ is the energy width of the nucleus. Instead of ([\ref=Mi0]), we consider the sub-matrix

[formula]

because only the non-zero, off-diagonal terms are relevant.

Before the ion decays, the nucleus and the electron separately can be represented by [\cite=papini]

[formula]

where l = e,n and |ψl+〉 and |ψl-〉 are the two helicity states. The coefficients al(t) and bl(t) evolve in time according to the equation

[formula]

which can be solved by diagonalizing the matrices Ml.

The spin flip probabilities for electron and nucleus are

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

The probability for electron and nucleus to flip their spins at time t, if at t = 0 their spins were both antiparallel to the nucleus momentum, is

[formula]

[formula]

We use the uncorrelated probability ([\ref=PePi]) because in our model the electron and nucleus spins are treated as independent. The second and third terms in ([\ref=PePi]) represent the spin-flip angular frequencies of nucleus and electron. The latter frequency, when applied to the muon, gives the muon anomaly in g - 2 experiments. The fourth term represents transitions to the forbidden spin-3 / 2 final state with angular frequency [formula]. The last term yields the probability that the electron and nucleus spins are antiparallel, which is the probability of interest. We obtain

[formula]

The angular frequency [formula] with which the electron and ion spins find themselves antiparallel and which, therefore, enables the ion decay, must now be related to laboratory system quantities.

We now follow [\cite=bell] [\cite=jackson] [\cite=jacksonbook] and re-introduce standard units.

The calculation of the precession frequency of the electron spin in its motion about the heavy nucleus first takes into account the contribution given by the first term in ([\ref=He]) which in the nucleus rest frame is given by [formula]. We also assume that [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are the magnetic and electric fields in the nucleus rest frame and [formula] is the velocity of the electron relative to the nucleus. The spin-rotation term in ([\ref=He]) is given, in the rest frame of the electron, by [formula], where [formula] is the electron acceleration, and [formula] is the Lorentz factor. [formula], hence [formula], are generated by the Coulomb force [formula], where [formula] is the electric field of the charged nucleus, and by the Lorentz force [formula]), where [formula] and [formula] are the electric and magnetic fields in the rest frame of the electron. They are related to the magnetic field of the storage ring by means of a Lorentz transformation. Since the electron propagates in an external magnetic field, its velocity is shifted by ~  μBB|ψ100|2. This term, however, turns out to be negligible.

The electric field [formula] gives rise to the anomalous Zeeman effect. This term is not relevant to our study and will not be considered further.

The force [formula], on the other hand, generates an acceleration of the bound electron that contributes to the Thomas precession, hence to the precession of the electron spin with respect to the magnetic field [formula]. Passing from the electron rest frame to the nucleus frame and using the Lorentz transformation of the electric and magnetic fields, the Thomas precession becomes [formula]. Therefore, the precession frequency of the electron is given by [formula], where

[formula]

ae = (|ge| - 2) / 2 is the electron magnetic moment anomaly, and [formula] is a unitary vector direct along the x2-axis. It is parallel to the magnetic field of the storage ring and therefore orthogonal to the circular orbit of the nucleus.

If the nucleus moves along a circular orbit in the presence of only the external magnetic field, then the precession frequency of the nucleus spin, in the reference frame comoving with the nucleus, is [formula] [\cite=jackson] [\cite=jacksonbook], where

[formula]

A and Z are the mass and charge numbers, and we have written [formula]. The spin of the nucleus does not precess if μnM /  = 1. In ([\ref=Omega-i]) we have approximated M by Amp. The calculation of M can be improved by including contributions from nucleon binding energies, nuclear surface and Coulomb repulsion effects and the Pauli exclusion principle. Not all these contributions are positive.

We must now calculate the relative spin precession that the motions of electron and nucleus generate. From ([\ref=Omega-e]), ([\ref=Omega-i]) we obtain

[formula]

The magnetic field is related to the the angular velocity of the particles in the laboratory frame 2πf by

[formula]

where [formula] is the Lorentz factor, and ρ is the radius of the orbits. The revolution frequency f of the primary beam can be obtained from f = v / L, where L is the length of the closed orbit, and from the definition of magnetic rigidity Bρ = Mvγ / Q [\cite=geissel]. We get

[formula]

It is the frequency Ω / 2π that must be compared with the experimental signal 0.14  Hz found for [formula]Pr  58  + and [formula]Pm  60  + by means of the equation

[formula]

The calculation of g-factors, based on bound state (BS) QED, can be carried out with accuracy even though, in our case, the expansion parameter is Zα≃0.4. The results agree with available direct measurements [\cite=vogel]-[\cite=moskov]. In particular, the BS-QED calculation given in [\cite=blundell] includes radiative corrections of order α  /  π and exact binding corrections. It yields

[formula]

where C(2) can be approximated by

[formula]

The values of gbe calculated by applying ([\ref=gb]) to C5 + and O7 + are in good agreement with the experimental results. The same formula ([\ref=gb]) extrapolated to Z = 59 and Z = 61, gives gbe≃1.87205 for [formula]Pr  58  + and gbe≃1.86365 for [formula]Pm  60  +. The addition of more expansion terms following the formulae given in [\cite=CODATA] does not change these results appreciably. The corresponding anomalous parts become respectively ae≃ - 0.06397 and ae≃ - 0.06817. The only free parameter in ([\ref=Omega]) is the electron Lorentz factor γe. It can be fixed by using one set of experimental data and using the result in the second set. Alternatively, we can choose as free parameter the average distance R of the electron from the nucleus and estimate the electron velocity by means of the equation [formula]. We obtain [formula], where [formula]. From the experimental values L = 108.3  m, Bρ = 6.44  Tm, γ = 1.43, β = 0.71, assuming that [formula] as given in [\cite=GSI], using the values of ae just found and treating R as a parameter, we find that equation ([\ref=Omega-f]) has the solutions [formula] and [formula], which correspond to [formula] for Pr58 +, and [formula] for Pm60 +. Here aZ( = a0 / Z) is the Bohr radius (a0  ~  0.53  ×  10- 10m). As a comparison, the nuclear radius is given by [formula], in nuclear models in which the nucleons are uniformly distributed in the nucleus (R0  ~  1.2  fm).

In our calculations we have adhered to the assignment [formula] [\cite=GSI]. However, a need for a re-measurement of nuclear magnetic moments arises from improved ways to probe QED effects, as pointed out in [\cite=gustavsson].

Eq. ([\ref=Omega]) does not depend on [formula]. This should be expected because the electron orbits and those to which ([\ref=f]) refers are classical. This is also the extent to which the treatments of particles in storage rings given in [\cite=bell] and [\cite=jackson] agree (see the discussion given in [\cite=bell]). Bell and Leinaas consider quantum fluctuations away from the classical orbit. We neglect them, in agreement with Jackson [\cite=jackson].

The model has consequences that must be emphasized.

Identical ions in rings of different radii ρ1 and ρ2, but with the same magnetic rigidity, and the same speed, give rise to Ω  ~  ρ- 1. Therefore, the effect becomes smaller in larger rings for fixed A / Z, ge and [formula].

It is also clear that according to our hypothesis, which is essentially based on the coupling between rotation and the spins of electron and nucleus, the GSI effect disappears when f = 0. Accordingly, the effect can not be measured in experiments based on the linear motion of the ions, nor can it be observed by stopping ions in thick aluminum foils [\cite=vetter].

A more complete model would also require the relativistic treatment of hydrogen-like atoms (with large nuclear charge) in a noninertial reference frame.

In summary, the GSI experiments measure Ω in our model and are well suited to study nuclear radii, ge and [formula]. This is important in fields like nuclear physics, QED, BS-QED and stellar nucleosynthesis [\cite=takahashi].
