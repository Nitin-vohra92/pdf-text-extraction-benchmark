On Quasiconvexity and Relatively Hyperbolic Structures on Groups

Introduction

If G is a countable group and P is a collection of subgroups of G, the notion of (strong) relative hyperbolicity for the pair (G,P) has been defined by different authors, all these definitions being equivalent under mild conditions [\cite=HK08]. Notions of relatively quasiconvex subgroups intending to generalize the notion of quasiconvex subgroup in hyperbolic groups have been introduced by different authors [\cite=DA03] [\cite=HK08] [\cite=MaWi10b] [\cite=Os06]. All these notions were proved to be equivalent [\cite=HK08] [\cite=MaWi10b] in the case that G is countable and P is a finite collection of subgroups.

The quasiconvex subgroups of a relatively hyperbolic pair (G,P) is an interesting class of subgroups of G. For example, this class is closed under finite intersections [\cite=HK08] [\cite=MP09], contains all virtually cyclic subgroups [\cite=Os06], and every element admits a naturally a relatively hyperbolic group structure [\cite=HK08]. A countable group G can have different relatively hyperbolic structures giving rise to different collections of subgroups of G with these properties. In this paper, we start an investigation of how the collection of quasiconvex subgroups of (G,P) varies with respect to P. Our main result is the following:

Let G be a group, and let (G,P1) and (G,P2) be relatively hyperbolic structures with P1  ⊂  P2. Suppose that Q is a subgroup of G.

If Q is quasiconvex in (G,P1) , then Q is quasiconvex in (G,P2).

If Q is a quasiconvex in (G,P2), and for every [formula] and every g∈G the subgroup [formula] is quasiconvex in (G,P1), then Q is quasiconvex in (G,P1).

Recall that a group is called elementary if it contains a cyclic group of finite index.

Let G be a group, and (G,P1) and (G,P2) be relatively hyperbolic structures with P1  ⊂  P2. Then (G,P1) and (G,P2) have the same class of quasiconvex subgroups if and only if every [formula] is elementary.

A group is coherent if every finitely generated subgroup is finitely presented. A relatively hyperbolic pair (G,P) is called locally quasiconvex if every finitely generated subgroup of G is a quasiconvex subgroup of (G,P).

In [\cite=WM10], Wise and that author use the following corollary to obtain results on coherence and local quasiconvexity for high powered one relator products.

Suppose that (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic and locally quasiconvex. The following statements hold:

If each P∈P is a coherent group, then G is coherent.

If each P∈P is a locally quasiconvex hyperbolic group, then G is a locally quasiconvex hyperbolic group.

We recover the following result from [\cite=AGM08] without the assumption that the group G is torsion free.

[\cite=AGM08] Let Q be a quasiconvex subgroup of a hyperbolic group G. Then there is a finite collection of subgroups P of G with the following properties.

(G,P) is relatively hyperbolic,

Q is quasiconvex in (G,P), and

for each P∈P, the subgroup [formula] has finite index in P.

The definition of relative quasiconvexity in the paper [\cite=AGM08] differs from definition [\ref=defn:Quasi-convexSubgroup] of relative quasiconvexity in this paper. The equivalence of these two definitions is a result by Manning and the author [\cite=MM09].

[\cite=Os06-3] Let (G,P) be relatively hyperbolic. A subgroup H  ≤  G is said to be hyperbolically embedded into (GP), if the pair [formula] is relatively hyperbolic.

The following result is a Corollary of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and previous work of the author [\cite=MP09]. It is a combination theorem of quasiconvex subgroups and hyperbolically embedded subgroups. In the case of hyperbolic groups, it is a result by Gitik [\cite=Gi99].

Let (G,P) be relatively hyperbolic, and suppose that S is a finite generating set of G. For every quasiconvex subgroup Q of (G,P), and every hyperbolically embedded subgroup H of (G,P), there is constant C  >  0 with the following property. If R is a subgroup of H such that

[formula], and

|g|S  ≥  C for any [formula],

then the natural homomorphism

[formula]

is injective. Moreover, if the subgroup R is quasiconvex relative to P, then the subgroup [formula] is quasiconvex relative to P.

The following is a stronger version of a result by G. Arzhntseva and A. Minasyan [\cite=AM07] used to prove that relatively hyperbolic groups with no non-trivial finite normal subgroups are C*-simple. The result is a combination theorem for cyclic subgroups of relatively hyperbolic groups. The original result does not include the statement on quasiconvexity of the combinated subgroup.

Let G be a non-elementary and properly relatively hyperbolic group with respect to a collection of subgroups P. Suppose that G has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups. Then for any finite subset F of non-trivial elements of G there exists an element g∈G with the following properties. For every f∈F,

〈f,g〉 is isomorphic to the free product [formula], and

〈f,g〉 is a quasiconvex subgroup relative to P.

The paper is organized as follows. Section [\ref=sec.hyperbolicity] introduces background and notation. In section [\ref=sec.quasigeodesics] a technical result on the geometry of hyperbolically embedded subgroups is proved. In the last section the proofs of the main result and corollaries are discussed.

Definitions and Background

Relative hyperbolicity

The definition in this subsection is based on the work by D. Osin in [\cite=Os06], in particular, we will include finite generation in the definition of relative hyperbolicity. After the work of Hruska [\cite=HK08], the results of this paper hold without the finite generation assumption, more especifially, for countable relatively hyperbolic groups with finite peripheral structure.

Let G be a finitely generated group, P a finite collection of subgroups of G, and S a finite generating set. Denote by Γ(G,P,S) the Cayley graph of G with respect to the generating set [formula]. If p is a path between vertices in Γ(G,P,S), we will refer to its initial vertex as p-, and its terminal vertex as p+. The path p determines a word [formula] in the alphabet [formula] that represents an element g∈G so that p+  =  p-g.

The pair (G,P) is weakly relatively hyperbolic if there is an integer δ  ≥  0 such that Γ(G,P,S) is δ-hyperbolic. We may also say that G is weakly relatively hyperbolic, relative to P.

Let q be a combinatorial path in the Cayley graph Γ(G,P,S). Sub-paths of q with at least one edge are called non-trivial. For Pi∈P, a Pi-component of q is a maximal non-trivial sub-path s of q with Label(s) a word in the alphabet Pi. When we don't need to specify the index i, we will refer to Pi-components as P-components.

Two P-components s1, s2 are connected if the vertices of s1 and s2 belong to the same left coset of Pi for some i. A P-component s of q is isolated if it is not connected to a different P-component of q. The path q is without backtracking if every P-component of q is isolated.

A vertex v of q is called phase if it is not an interior vertex of a P-component s of q. Let p and q be paths between vertices in Γ(G,P,S). The paths p and q are k-similar if

[formula]

where distS is the metric induced by the finite generating set S (as opposed to the metric in Γ(G,P,S)).

A geodesic path q in Γ(G,P,S) is without backtracking, all P-components of q consist of a single edge, and all vertices of q are phase.

The pair (G,P) satisfies the BCP property if for any λ  ≥  1, c  ≥  0, k  ≥  0, there exists an integer ε(λ,c,k)  >  0 such that for p and q any two k-similar (λ,c)-quasi-geodesics in Γ(G,P,S) without backtracking, the following conditions hold:

The sets of phase vertices of p and q are contained in the closed ε(λ,c,k)-neighborhoods of each other, with respect to the metric distS.

If s is any P-component of p such that distS(s-,s+)  >  ε(λ,c,k), then there exists a P-component t of q that is connected to s.

If s and t are connected P-components of p and q respectively, then

[formula]

Our definition of the BCP property corresponds to the conclusion of Theorem 3.23 in [\cite=Os06].

The pair (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic if the group G is weakly relatively hyperbolic relative to P and the pair (G,P) satisfies the Bounded Coset Penetration property. If (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic then we say G is relatively hyperbolic, relative to P; if there is no ambiguity, we just say that G is relatively hyperbolic.

Definition [\ref=defn:rel_hyp] given here is equivalent to Osin's [\cite=Os06] for finitely generated groups: To see that Osin's definition implies [\ref=defn:rel_hyp], apply [\cite=Os06]; to see that [\ref=defn:rel_hyp] implies Osin's definition, apply [\cite=Os06]. For the equivalence of Osin's definition and the various other definitions of relative hyperbolicity see [\cite=HK08] and the references therein. The definition of relative hyperbolicity is independent of finite relative generating set S.

The following corollary is a straight forward application of the BCP-property.

[\cite=MP09] Let (G,P) be relatively hyperbolic, and S is a finite generating set of G. Suppose that P and P' are elements of P, f and g are elements of G, and gP and fP' are different left cosets. Then for any pair of geodesics p and q in Γ(G,P,S) such that p-,q-∈gP, p+,q+∈fP', and neither p nor q have more than one vertex in gP or fP', the following holds.

l(q)  ≤  l(p)  +  2, and

q and p are ε(1,4,0)-similar.

Parabolic and Relatively Quasiconvex Subgroups

In this subsection, (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic, and S is a finite generating set for G.

The peripheral subgroups of G are the elements of P. A subgroup of G is called parabolic in (G,P) if it can be conjugated into a peripheral subgroup.

[\cite=Os06] A subgroup Q of G is called quasiconvex relative to P or simply quasiconvex in (G,P) if there exists a constant σ  ≥  0 such that the following holds: Let f, g be two elements of Q, and p an arbitrary geodesic path from f to g in the Cayley graph Γ(G,P,S). For any vertex v∈p, there exists a vertex w∈Q such that distS(v,w)  ≤  σ, where distS is the word metric induced by S. If referring to the constant σ is necessary, we say that Q is σ-quasiconvex in (G,P,S).

Dahmani [\cite=DA03] and Osin [\cite=Os06] studied classes of subgroups of relatively hyperbolic groups which they called relatively quasiconvex, intending to generalize the notion of quasiconvexity in hyperbolic groups. Hruska introduced several notions of relative quasiconvexity in the setting of countable (not necessarily finitely generated) relatively hyperbolic groups, including the notions based on Osin's and Dahmani's, and showed that they are equivalent [\cite=HK08].

Any parabolic subgroup of (G,P) is quasiconvex in (G,P).

This follows directly from the BCP-property and the definition of quasiconvex subgroup.

[\cite=HK08] [\cite=MP09] Let Q and R be quasiconvex subgroups in (G,P). Then [formula] is quasiconvex in (G,P).

[\cite=HK08] [\cite=MP09] Let Q be σ-quasiconvex in (G,P,S). Then any infinite maximal parabolic subgroup of Q is conjugate by an element of Q to a subgroup in the set In particular, the number of infinite maximal parabolic subgroups up to conjugacy in Q is finite.

On the intersection of subgroups in countable groups.

A version of the following result can be found in [\cite=MP09], and for the interested reader a more general version appears in [\cite=HK08]. It will be used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

[\cite=HK08] [\cite=MP09] Let A be a countable group with a proper left invariant metric d. Then for any B and C subgroups of A, and any constant K  ≥  0, there exists M  =  M(B,C,K)  ≥  0 so that

[formula]

where NK(gC) and [formula] denote the closed K-neighborhood and the closed M-neighborhood of gC and [formula] in (A,d) respectively.

Quasigeodesics and Hyperbolically embedded subgroups

The section consists of three parts. First, a result by Osin in [\cite=Os06-1] is discussed. In the second subsection, some results on hyperbolically embedded subgroups from [\cite=Os06-3] are recalled. The last subsection states and proves the main result of the section, Proposition [\ref=prof:hyp_emb]. This result shows that certain paths in Γ(G,P,S) induced by geodesics in [formula] are quasigeodesics.

A Result about Polygons by Osin

The following proposition is proved by Osin in [\cite=Os06-1] for a more general context in which relatively hyperbolic groups are not assume to be finitely generated.

[\cite=Os06-1] Let (G,P) be relatively hyperbolic and S a finite generating set. Then there exists a constant M > 0 such that the following holds. Let q be a cycle in Γ(G,P,S), and [formula] a set of isolated P-components of q. Then

[formula]

The original statement of the above Proposition in [\cite=Os06-1] includes the existence of a finite subset Ω of G, and the conclusion is stated in terms of the word distance distΩ rather than distS. The above statement follows by observing that for any finite subset Ω and for any generating set S, there is a constant L > 0 such that distΩ(f,g)  ≤  LdistS(f,g) whenever distΩ(f,g) is a finite number.

Hyperbolically Embedded Subgroups

In this subsection, (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic, and S is a finite generating set for G.

[\cite=Os06-3] Let (G,P) be relatively hyperbolic. A subgroup H  ≤  G is said to be hyperbolically embedded into (GP), if the pair [formula] is relatively hyperbolic.

The hyperbolically embedded groups where characterized by Bowditch [\cite=BO99] for the case that G is a hyperbolic group, and by Osin [\cite=Os06-3] for the general case.

[\cite=Os06-3] A subgroup H of G is hyperbolically embedded int (G,P), if the following conditions hold.

Q is generated by a finite set Y.

There exists λ,c  ≥  0 such that for any element g∈Q, we have [formula].

For any g∈G such that [formula], the intersection [formula] is finite.

[\cite=Os06-3] Let H be a hyperbolically embedded into (G,P). Then H is a hyperbolic group, and H is quasiconvex in (G,P).

By Theorem [\ref=thm:hyp-emb-char], the Cayley graph of H with respect to the finite generating set Y is quasi-isometrically embedded into the hyperbolic space Γ(G,P,S). Therefore H is a hyperbolic group. The bounded coset penetration property, Definition [\ref=BCP], implies that phase vertices of geodesics in Γ(G,P,S) with endpoints in H stay closed to quasigeodesics inside H with respect to the metric distS. Therefore H is quasiconvex in (G,P).

The next Corollaries is a result known by the experts in the field, but there are no references available.

Let G be a group, and let (G,P1) and (G,P2) be relatively hyperbolic structures with P1  ⊂  P2. Then for any collection of subgroups P such that P1  ⊂  P  ⊂  P2, the pair (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic. In particular, each subgroup H in [formula] is hyperbolically embedded.

It is enough to show that every element of [formula] is hyperbolically embedded into (G,P1). Then the statement of the theorem follows by induction on the size of [formula].

Conditions [\eqref=fin-gen] and [\eqref=malnormal] of Theorem [\ref=thm:hyp-emb-char] are satisfied by every subgroup in P2 since G is finitely generated and (G,P2) is relatively hyperbolic, see for example [\cite=Os06]. Let Q be a subgroup in [formula] and Y a generating set of Q. We will show that Q also satisfies condition [\eqref=quasiconvex] of Theorem [\ref=thm:hyp-emb-char] and therefore Q is hyperbolically embedded into (G,P1).

Let S be a finite generating set of G, Y a finite generating set of Q, and, without lost of generality, assume that Y  ⊂  S. Let D > 0 be given by Proposition [\ref=thm:n-gon-2] applied to (G,P1) and the generating set S. Regard Γ(G,P2,S) as a subgraph of Γ(G,P1,S) in the obvious way. Let g be an element of Q. Let r be a geodesic in Γ(G,P1,S) from the identity element to g. Since Q is an element of P2, there is an edge p in Γ(G,P2,S) from the identity element to g. Consider r as a polygonal path, and let q be the closed cycle formed by r and p in Γ(G,P2,S). Since r has no Q-components, p is an isolated Q-component of the cycle q. Since the length of q is [formula], Theorem [\ref=thm:n-gon-2] implies

[formula]

Therefore Q also satisfies condition [\eqref=quasiconvex] of Theorem [\ref=thm:hyp-emb-char] and therefore Q is hyperbolically embedded relative to H2.

Technical Result on Quasigeodesics and Hyperbolically Embedded Groups

In this subsection, let (G,P) be relatively hyperbolic, S a finite generating set for G, and H a hyperbolically embedded subgroup in (G,P). Let [formula] and [formula] denote the metrics in Γ(G,P,S) and [formula] respectively.

There exist constants λ  =  λ(G,S,P,H)  ≥  1 and c  =  c(G,S,P,H)  ≥  0 with the following property.

If p is a geodesic in [formula] and q is a path in Γ(G,P,S) obtained by replacing each H-component of p by a geodesic segment in Γ(G,P,S) connecting its endpoints, then q is a (λ,c)-quasi-geodesic in Γ(G,P,S).

The proof of Proposition [\ref=prof:hyp_emb] is based in Lemma [\ref=lem:hyp_emb].

For any λ  ≥  1 and c  ≥  0, there exist a constant with the following property.

Let p be any path in [formula] such that:

p is without backtracking,

p is of the form [formula], where each si is a geodesic segment in [formula], and {ti}ki = 1 are all the Q-components of p,

p is a (λ,c)-quasi-geodesic.

Then the path [formula] in Γ(G,P,S), where each ui is a geodesic segment in Γ(G,P,S) connecting the endpoints of ti, satisfies

[formula]

Since H is hyperbolically embedded, the group G is hyperbolic relative to [formula]. Let D > 0 be the constant given by Proposition [\ref=thm:n-gon-2] for the pair [formula] and the generating set S. Regard Γ(G,P,S) as a subgraph of [formula].

Let p and q be paths as in the statement of the Lemma, and r a geodesic in Γ(G,P,S) connecting the endpoints of p. In [formula], consider r as a polygonal path and let u be the closed polygon in [formula] given by Since p is a (λ,c)-quasigeodesic, the length of u satisfies

[formula]

Since each ti is an isolated H-component of u, Proposition [\ref=thm:n-gon-2] and the above inequality implies

[formula]

Now we estimate the length of q. Since p is (λ,c)-quasigeodesic, we have

[formula]

which finish the proof of the Lemma.

Decompose the path p as

[formula]

where {ti}ki = 1 are all the H-components of p. Then the path q in Γ(G,P,S) decomposes as

[formula]

where each ui is a geodesic segment in Γ(G,P,S) connecting the endpoints of ti.

Let q' be a subpath of q. We consider two cases: Case 1. Suppose that q' is of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are subpaths of [formula] and [formula] respectively. In this case, Lemma  [\ref=lem:hyp_emb] implies that

[formula]

where L1  =  L1(G,S,P,H).

Case 2. Otherwise, at least one of the endpoints of q' is a vertex of ui for some i. There are three similar cases to consider. We only consider one and leave the other two for the reader. Suppose that q' is of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are subpaths of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Let p' be the path in [formula] given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] correspond to single edges connecting the endpoints of [formula] and [formula] respectively. Corollary  [\ref=cor:TubeLemma] shows that p' is a (4,0)-quasi-geodesic in [formula]. Lemma  [\ref=lem:hyp_emb] implies that

[formula]

where L2  =  L2(G,S,P,H,4,0). To finish the proof define λ  =  c  =   max {L1,L2}.

Proofs of the Main Results

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main]

Suppose that (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic, and H is a hyperbolically embedded subgroup of G.

If R is a quasiconvex subgroup of (G,P), then R is quasiconvex in [formula].

Let f be an element of R and let p be a geodesic in [formula] from 1 to f. Let q be the path in Γ(G,P,S) obtained by replacing each H-component of p by a geodesic segment in Γ(G,P,S). Proposition  [\ref=prof:hyp_emb] implies that q is a (λ,c)-quasi-geodesic in Γ(G,P,S), where the constants λ and c are independent of the element f and the path p. Since R is σ-quasiconvex in (G,P,S), the BCP property implies that for any vertex u of q (in particular, for any vertex of p) there is a vertex v∈R such that distS(u,v)  ≤  ε(λ,c,0)  +  σ. It follows that R is (ε(λ,c,0)  +  σ)-quasiconvex relative to [formula].

Suppose that (G,P) is relatively hyperbolic, H is a hyperbolically embedded subgroup in (G,P), and S is a finite generating set of G.

If Q is a σ-quasiconvex subgroup in [formula], and for any g∈G with |g|S  ≤  σ the subgroup [formula] is σ2-quasiconvex in (G,P,S), then Q is quasiconvex in (G,P).

By the BCP property, Q is quasiconvex in (G,P) if there are constants λ  ≥  1, c  ≥  0, σ' such that for any f∈Q and some (λ,c)-quasi-geodesic q in Γ(G,P,S), all phase vertices of q are at most S-distance σ' from an element of Q.

Let f be an element of Q, p a geodesic in [formula] from 1 to f, and q be the path in Γ(G,P,S) obtained by replacing each Q-component of qby geodesic segments in Γ(G,P,S). Proposition [\ref=prof:hyp_emb] implies that q is a (λ,c)-quasi-geodesic in Γ(G,P,S) with λ and c independent of f and q. Decompose the path p as

[formula]

where {ti}ki = 1 are all the Q-components of q. Then the path q in Γ(G,P,S) decomposes as

[formula]

where each ui is a geodesic segment in Γ(G,P,S) connecting the endpoints of ti.

Since Q is σ-quasiconvex in [formula], all phase vertices of si are at S-distance at most σ from elements of Q. It remains to show that all phase vertices of ui are at S-distance at most an uniform constant independent of Q, f, p and ui.

Define

[formula]

where M(Q,gHg- 1,σ) is the constant given by Proposition [\ref=lem:quasiorthogonality1] for the group G with the metric distS, the subgroups Q and gHg- 1, and the constant σ.

Claim 1. For each [formula], the endpoints of the segment ui are at distance at most L = M + σ from a left coset [formula] with respect to the metric distS. Here xi∈Q and gi∈G with |g|X  ≤  σ.

To simplify notation denote the segment ui by u. Since Q is quasiconvex relative to [formula], there exists elements x and y of Q such that Let g denote the element x- 1u- and notice that |g|X  ≤  σ. Since distS(x- 1y,gH)  =  distS(y,u-H)  ≤  σ and x- 1y∈Q, Proposition [\ref=lem:quasiorthogonality1] implies that there is an element [formula] such that distS(x- 1y,z)  ≤  M. It follows

[formula]

where x∈Q, |g|S  ≤  σ, and [formula].

Claim 2. For each [formula], every vertex of the segment ui is at S-distance at most (ε(λ,c,L) + σ2) from an element of Q. This claim finish the proof of the lemma.

Let x- 1iui be the geodesic segment obtained after multiplying ui by x- 1 on the left. Then x- 1iui is a segment with endpoints at distance L of the [formula]. Since [formula] is σ2-quasiconvex in (G,P,S), the BCP-property [\ref=BCP] implies that all phase vertices of x- 1iui are at S-distance (ε(λ,c,L) + σ2) from elements of [formula]. To conclude, since [formula] is subset of Q, all vertices of ui are at most S-distance (ε(λ,c,L) + σ2) of an element of Q.

By Corollary [\ref=cor:sandwich] every element of [formula] is hyperbolically embedded relative to H2. If Q < G is quasiconvex in (G,P2), an induction argument using Proposition [\ref=thm:main-1] shows that Q is quasiconvex in (G,P1).

Suppose that Q is σ-quasiconvex in (G,P2,S), and that [formula] is quasiconvex in (G,P1) for every [formula] and g∈G . Suppose that [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=cor:sandwich], [formula] is relatively hyperbolic. By the first part of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] (already proved), [formula] is quasiconvex in [formula]. Since Ql is hyperbolically embedded into [formula], Proposition [\ref=thm:main-2] implies that Q is quasiconvex in [formula]. Repeating the argument l number of times shows that Q is quasiconvex in (G,P1).

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:elementary]

Since every non-elementary hyperbolic group contains a subgroup isomorphic to a free group in two generators, the following proposition is immediate.

If H is a hyperbolic group with the property that any subgroup is finitely generated, then H is an elementary subgroup.

Suppose that (G,P1) and (G,P2) have the same class of quasiconvex subgroups, and let H be any subgroup in [formula]. By Corollaries [\ref=thm:hyp-qcx] and  [\ref=cor:sandwich], H is hyperbolically embedded and therefore a hyperbolic group. Furthermore, any subgroup of H is quasiconvex in (G,P1) and, in particular, relatively finitely generated in (G,P1). Since the intersection of H with any conjugate in G of a subgroup in P1 is finite, it follows that any subgroup of H is finitely generated. By Proposition [\ref=prop:elem], H is an elementary group.

Suppose that each subgroup in [formula] is elementary. Since elementary subgroups are always quasiconvex [\cite=Os06], Theorem [\ref=thm:main] implies that (G,P1) and (G,P2) have the same class of quasiconvex subgroups.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:coh]

Suppose that each P∈P is coherent, and let Q be a finitely generated subgroup of G. By hypothesis, Q is quasiconvex in (G,P), and therefore hyperbolic relative to a finite collection K of parabolic subgroups of G [\cite=HK08]. It follows that each K∈K is finitely generated [\cite=Os06], and by coherence of the maximal parabolic subgroups of G, each K∈K is finitely presented. By [\cite=Os06], Q is finitely presented.

Suppose that each maximal parabolic subgroup of G is a locally quasiconvex hyperbolic group. Since each P∈P is hyperbolic, the group G is hyperbolic [\cite=Os06]. Let Q be a finitely generated subgroup of G. As before, local quasiconvexity of (G,P) implies that every maximal parabolic subgroup of Q in (G,P) is finitely generated. Therefore every maximal parabolic subgroup of Q in (G,P) is quasiconvex in a maximal parabolic subgroup of G, and hence quasiconvex in G. By Theorem [\ref=thm:main], Q is quasiconvex in G.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:3]

For the convenience of the reader, we briefly describe the peripheral structure induced by a quasiconvex subgroup in a hyperbolic group following the exposition in [\cite=AGM08]. The relative quasiconvexity of H with respect to P will follow from a direct application of Theorem [\ref=thm:main].

Suppose that G is a hyperbolic group and H is a quasiconvex subgroup. In [\cite=AGM08], it is shown that there is a finite collection of subgroups D of H called the malnormal core of H with the following properties.

For any D∈D and [formula], the intersection [formula] is finite, and

for any distinct pair D,D'∈D and [formula], the intersection [formula] is finite.

The existence of the malnormal core of H does not required G to be torsion free, and only uses that any infinite quasiconvex subgroup of a word hyperbolic group has a finite index in its commensurator [\cite=KS96], and that the height of any quasiconvex subgroup is finite [\cite=GMRS].

The collection D gives rise to a collection of peripheral subgroups P for G in two steps. First change D to D0 by replacing each element of D by its commensurator in G. Then eliminate redundant entries of D0 to obtain P  ⊂  D0 which contains no two elements which are conjugate in G. The collection P is called the peripheral structure of G induced by H.

Since all elements of P are commensurators of infinite quasiconvex subgroups, they are quasiconvex subgroups. Moreover

for any P∈P and [formula], the intersection [formula] is finite,

for any distinct pair P,P'∈P and [formula], the intersection [formula] is finite, and

for any P∈P, the intersection [formula] is a finite index subgroup of P.

By a result of Bowditch [\cite=BO99], the group G is hyperbolic relative to P. Since H is a quasiconvex subgroup of G, by Theorem [\ref=thm:main] H is a quasiconvex subgroup of G relative to P.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:1]

Since Q is σ-quasiconvex in (G,P,S), and H is hyperbolically embedded into (G,P). Theorem [\ref=thm:main] implies that Q is quasiconvex in [formula]. By [\cite=MP09], there is a constant C = C(P,H,S) such that the homomorphism

[formula]

is injective if for any subgroup R such that [formula] and |g|X  ≥  C for all [formula].

Let R be quasiconvex in (G,P), and suppose that [formula] and |g|S  ≥  C for all [formula]. By [\cite=MP09], [formula] is quasiconvex relative to [formula]. We claim that [formula] is also quasiconvex relative to P.

By Proposition [\ref=prop:parabolics] every infinite maximal parabolic subgroup of Q with respect to [formula] is conjugate by an element of Q to a subgroup in the collection Since H is hyperbolically embedded into (G,P), H is quasiconvex in (G,P). By Proposition [\ref=prop:intersection], [formula] is quasiconvex in (G,P) for any z∈G. Therefore, every subgroup in the collection Π is quasiconvex in (G,P).

By [\cite=MP09], every infinite maximal parabolic subgroup of [formula] with respect to [formula] is conjugate by an element of [formula] to maximal parabolic subgroup of Q or R, and therefore to a subgroup in the collection Since R is quasiconvex in (G,P), it follows that every subgroup in the collection Π2 is quasiconvex in (G,P). Theorem [\ref=thm:main] implies that [formula] is quasiconvex relative to P.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:2]

We follow the argument by G. Arzhantseva and A. Minasyan in [\cite=AM07] by quoting two results. Then we argue that the subgroups 〈f,g〉 are quasiconvex relative to P.

[\cite=AM07] Let G be a hyperbolic group with respect to a collection of subgroups P. Let F be a finite subset of G. Then there exists a collection of subgroups P' with the following properties:

G is hyperbolic relative to P',

P  ⊂  P',

every [formula] is finite or elementary, and

every element of F is parabolic relative to P'.

[\cite=AMO07] [\cite=AM07] Let G be a non-elementary and properly relatively hyperbolic group with respect to a collection of subgroups P. Suppose that G has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups. Then there is a hyperbolic element h such that the subgroup 〈h〉 is hyperbolically embedded with respect to P.

Let P' be the peripheral structure given by Lemma [\ref=lem:am] for the set F. By Proposition [\ref=prop:am] there is a hyperbolic element h of infinite order such that the subgroup 〈h〉 is hyperbolically embedded with respect to P'.

Let f be an element of F. Since powers of hyperbolic elements are hyperbolic, the cyclic subgroups 〈f〉 and 〈h〉 intersect trivially. Applying Corollary [\ref=cor:1] to the subgroups 〈f〉 and 〈h〉, there is a positive integer n = n(f) such that for any m  ≥  n(f), the subgroup 〈f,hm〉 is isomorphic to [formula] and is quasiconvex relative to P'. By Corollary [\ref=cor:elementary] the subgroup 〈f,hm〉 is also quasiconvex relative to P.

To finish the proof, let g  =  hm where m is the minimum common multiple of {n(f):f∈F}.
