A non-periodic and two-dimensional example of elliptic homogenization

Introduction

Background.

When studying the microscale behavior (beyond the reach of numerical solution methods) of physical systems, one is naturally lead to the concept of homogenization, i.e., the theory of the convergence of sequences of partial differential equations.

The homogenization of periodic structures using the two-scale convergence technique is well-established due to the pioneering work by Gabriel Nguetseng [\cite=Ngu89] and the further development work by Grégoire Allaire [\cite=All92]. Generalizations of the two-scale convergence technique have been developed independently by, e.g., Maria Lusa Mascarenhas and Anca-Maria Toader [\cite=MasToa01] (scale convergence), Gabriel Nguetseng [\cite=Ngu03] [\cite=Ngu04] (Σ-convergence), and Anders Holmbom, Jeanette Silfver, Nils Svanstedt and Niklas Wellander [\cite=HolPhD96] [\cite=HSSW06] ("generalized" two-scale convergence).

A simple but possibly powerful method of analyzing non-periodic structures is the λ-scale convergence technique introduced by Anders Holmbom and Jeanette Silfver [\cite=HolSil06]. λ-scale convergence is scale convergence in the special case of using the Lebesgue (i.e., λ) measure and test functions periodic in the second argument [\cite=HolSil06]. Homogenization techniques based on this approach are developed in the doctoral thesis [\cite=SilPhD07] of Jeanette Silfver. These results are the point of departure for the main contributions in this paper.

Organization of the paper.

In Section [\ref=sec:convfunseq] we look at the convergence for sequences of functions. We start by stating the definition of the traditional notion of two-scale convergence as introduced by Gabriel Nguetseng [\cite=Ngu89]. Then we move on to generalizations of this convergence mode, namely "generalized" two-scale convergence [\cite=HolPhD96] [\cite=HSSW06] and scale convergence [\cite=MasToa01]. We conclude the section by introducing λ-scale convergence and the important notion of asymptotically uniformly distributed sequences [\cite=HolSil06] [\cite=SilPhD07].

Section [\ref=seq:convseqpartder] deals with the convergence for sequences of partial derivatives. We first look at how the two-scale convergence works for partial derivatives in the periodic case, and then we consider the more general case of λ-scale convergence of sequences of partial derivatives.

The concept of homogenization is introduced in Section [\ref=sec:ellhomo], which begins with stating the definition of H-convergence [\cite=Mur78], i.e., the generalization of Sergio Spagnolo's G-convergence of sequences of symmetric matrices [\cite=Spa67] [\cite=Spa68]. We give a theorem on the homogenization of a sequence of periodic matrices. We then introduce the important "type-[formula]" property, which is employed in the end of the section when formulating a theorem on the homogenization of λ-structures [\cite=SilPhD07].

In Section [\ref=sec:nonpertwodimex] we specifically study a non-periodic and two-dimensional example of a λ-structure with the property of not only having a periodic direction, but also having oscillations with a monotonically increasing frequency in one, non-periodic direction. We formulate and prove a series of proposition which are needed in order to prove the main result of this paper, Theorem [\ref=theo:lambdahomoex], in which we present a homogenization result for the considered λ-structure in the form of a homogenized matrix and a governing local problem.

The concluding Section [\ref=sec:numill] illustrates the results achieved in Section [\ref=sec:nonpertwodimex]. We numerically solve the local problem to obtain the non-constant homogenized matrix, and we heuristically explain why it is isotropic on a line along the periodic direction.

Notations.

The following more or less handy notations are employed:

The N-tuple [formula] in [formula] is denoted [formula], or ξ whenever convenient. Similarly, [formula], or simply the mere majuscule M when handy, denotes an N  ×  N matrix. A bold dot, i.e. [formula], represents a non-fixed variable, e.g., [formula] is the same as the function x  ↦  φ(x,y) where y is held fixed as a parameter. We will also allow expressions like, e.g., [formula] meaning x  ↦  kx. In this paper, Ω is always an open bounded non-empty subset of [formula] and, if nothing else is stated, Y is the unit cube (0,1)N in [formula]. The N-tuple [formula] of partial derivative operators is denoted by the symbol [formula]. Following, e.g., [\cite=CioDon99], the function space [formula] denotes the subspace of functions in [formula] with vanishing mean value.

Convergence for sequences of functions

The two-scale convergence method was introduced in 1989 by Gabriel Nguetseng [\cite=Ngu89], and a modern formulation is given by Definition [\ref=def:twoscaleconv] [\cite=LNgW02]. An important property of the two-scale convergence is given by Proposition [\ref=prop:twoscaleweak] [\cite=LNgW02].

If {uh} two-scale converges to u0, and [formula], then

[formula]

Analogous to a corresponding compactness result for weak convergence, we have Theorem [\ref=th:twoscalecomp] [\cite=LNgW02]. Introducing sequences of operators τh defined below we may extend Definition [\ref=def:twoscaleconv] of two-scale convergence to a generalized version according to Definition [\ref=def:gentwoscale] [\cite=HolPhD96] [\cite=HSSW06]. In order to achieve a compactness result like Theorem [\ref=th:twoscalecomp], we need Definition [\ref=def:compatible]. Using Definition [\ref=def:compatible], we have the compactness result according to Theorem [\ref=th:gentwoscalecomp] [\cite=HolPhD96] [\cite=HSSW06]. Using weak convergences, we can introduce a stronger version of two-scale compatibility than presented in Definition [\ref=def:compatible], see Definition [\ref=def:strongcompatible]. Compare Definition [\ref=def:strongcompatible] with the result of Proposition [\ref=prop:twoscaleweak].

An alternative generalization of two-scale convergence is scale convergence introduced by Maria Lusa Mascarenhas and Anca-Maria Toader in 2001 [\cite=MasToa01]. The definition of scale convergence is according to Definition [\ref=def:scaleconv]. A special case of scale convergence is achieved by choosing the same measure and same class of admissible test functions as in two-scale convergence, namely the Lebesgue measure λ and [formula], respectively. This leads to Definition [\ref=def:lambdascale] [\cite=SilPhD07] (see also [\cite=HolSil06]). A thorough treatment of how {αh} could be chosen to obtain strong two-scale compatibility is found in the doctoral thesis [\cite=SilPhD07] of Jeanette Silfver (see also [\cite=HolSil06]). We reproduce the results below.

Following [\cite=SilPhD07], we omit cases where M  ≠  N letting be a continuous bijection. Furthermore, {j}∞j = 1 is a covering of [formula] with unit cubes, and {jk}nNk = 1 a covering of j with cubes with side lengths [formula] in such a way that Yjk are Y-periodic repetitions of a cube Yk  ⊂  Y. Assuming that [formula] has a Lipschitz boundary, we define We also assume, for each h, that there exists a finite set [formula] such that [formula]. Similarly, introduce Finally, it is assumed that Ωhj  ⊂  Nr(h)(xh,j) for some ball Nr(h)(xh,j), centered at some xh,j∈Ωhj, with radius r(h)  →  0 as h  →    ∞  . Given the setting above, Definition [\ref=def:AUD] makes sense [\cite=SilPhD07] (see also [\cite=HolSil06]). This is sufficient to obtain the strong two-scale compatibility as promised, see Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdastronglytwoscale] [\cite=SilPhD07] (see also [\cite=HolSil06]).

Assume that Ω has a Lipschitz continuous boundary. Let {αh} be asymptotically uniformly distributed on Ω. Then {τh} defined by is strongly two-scale compatible with respect to [formula].

Note here that the admissible space in L2(Ω  ×  Y) is in this case [formula]. As a consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdastronglytwoscale], we have Corollary [\ref=cor:sublambdascale] [\cite=SilPhD07] (see also [\cite=HolSil06]). Note that the second scale dependence of the λ-scale limit vanishes, just like how it works for two-scale limits in the case of strong convergence [\cite=LNgW02].

Convergence for sequences of N-tuples of partial derivatives

Since sequences of partial differential equations in the context of homogenization typically involve N-tuples of partial derivatives of solutions, i.e., [formula], we need to investigate the two-scale limits for these. Indeed, for traditional periodic two-scale convergence, we have Proposition [\ref=prop:twoscalegrad] [\cite=All92] [\cite=Ngu89].

Let {uh} be a bounded sequence in H1(Ω) such that the strong limit in L2(Ω) is u. Then, up to a subsequence, there exists [formula] such that for any [formula],

[formula]

It should be noted here that bounded sequences in H1(Ω) strongly converge in L2(Ω), and we know that strongly convergent sequences in L2(Ω) have a subsequence with a two-scale limit with vanishing second scale.

A deciding step towards the homogenization of certain non-periodic problems is to prove the corresponding result for λ-scale convergence. We have Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdatwoscalegrad] proved by Jeanette Silfver in [\cite=SilPhD07] (see also [\cite=HolSil06]).

Let X be a Banach space for which and {αh} a sequence of functions which are continuous and bijective. We assume also that {τh} defined by is strongly two-scale compatible with respect to X. Furthermore, let [formula] be a Banach space such that [formula] is dense in Z, and let [formula] be its orthogonal complement in [formula]. Assume also that, for any [formula],

[formula]

Then, for any bounded sequence {uh} in H1(Ω) there exists a subsequence such that uh  →  u in L2(Ω) and, for any v∈X,

[formula]

and there exists [formula] such that, for any v∈XN,

[formula]

Property [\eqref=eq:vansecsca] is given by Corollary [\ref=cor:sublambdascale]. By using Green's formula twice, using assumption [\eqref=eq:traceofprod], and utilizing density, property [\eqref=eq:twoscagrad] follows from orthogonality.

Elliptic homogenization

In this section we present a homogenization result for elliptic problems governed by the sequence {αh} introduced earlier in this paper. Such results where first published in [\cite=SilPhD07], and in Sections [\ref=sec:nonpertwodimex] and [\ref=sec:numill] we present a special case in two dimensions and perform a numerical experiment, respectively.

The foundation upon which modern homogenization rests was erected in 1967-68 when Sergio Spagnolo developed the concept of G-convergence of sequences of symmetric matrices [\cite=Spa67] [\cite=Spa68], which has later been generalized by Franois Murat to H-convergence where the symmetry assumption is dropped, but at the cost of an imposed requirement on the sequence of flows [\cite=Mur78]. We begin by introducing a space of matrix valued functions according to Definition [\ref=def:Mspace]. We can now give Definition [\ref=def:ellHconv] defining the notion of H-convergence. When an H-limit has been found, one has homogenized the sequence of partial differential equations [\eqref=eq:PDEseq], and [\eqref=eq:homogenized] is the homogenized problem. For sequences of matrices which are periodic, we get Theorem [\ref=theo:elliptichomo] for the homogenization in this case [\cite=Ngu89] [\cite=All92]. We note that it is the term containing the local problem solution z which makes the H-limit B to deviate from the average of A over each periodicity cell Y. It is due to the u1 term in the two-scale convergence for partial derivatives and is obtained through a simple separation of variables of u1 with [formula] as the x-dependent part and z as the y-dependent part.

In the remainder of this paper, Ah in the sequence of problems [\eqref=eq:PDEseq] will be the composition [formula].

Below we present the result on non-periodic homogenization from [\cite=SilPhD07] announced in the beginning of this section. We start by giving Definition [\ref=def:typeH] [\cite=SilPhD07]. From Definition [\ref=def:typeH] and Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdatwoscalegrad], we have the homogenization result of Theorem [\ref=theo:lambdahomo] [\cite=SilPhD07].

First we make a weak formulation of the sequence of problems [\eqref=eq:PDEseq].

The homogenized problem [\eqref=eq:homoprob] is obtained by passing the weak formulation to the limit, using Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdatwoscalegrad].

The local problem [\eqref=eq:locprob] is derived by first choosing appropriate test functions, then utilizing the fact that {αh} is of type [formula], and finally employing the variational lemma.

A non-periodic and two-dimensional example

In order to justify the concept of homogenization of λ-structures, we take a look at a non-periodic two-dimensional example (thus, fixing N  =  2 from now on). Let [formula] and Ω be given by

[formula]

and Ω  =  (a1,b1)  ×  (a2,b2), respectively, where bi  >  ai  >  0, i  =  1,2. Thus, Ω is an open interval in the first quadrant of [formula]. In Figure [\ref=fig:twodimlambdastruct] we depict in the first quadrant the behaviour of some entry of [formula] for some (0,1)2-periodic matrix A. (To be specific, we have chosen an entry on the form 1  +  | sin πy1   sin πy2|1 / 2.) Note how the oscillation frequency increases with growing x2, while the periodicity is preserved in the x1 direction, as expected.

To homogenize the sequence [formula], we must first check that {αh} is asymptotically uniformly distributed on Ω. Indeed, we have Proposition [\ref=prop:AUDexample].

The sequence {αh} given in [\eqref=eq:alphahexample] is asymptotically uniformly distributed on Ω.

We define [formula] and [formula], where [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore, [formula]. Clearly, there exist bijections such that {J(j)}∞j = 1 is a covering of [formula], and [formula] is a covering of J(j). This merely shows that the way of enumerating the squares in this proof is equivalent to the way in Definition [\ref=def:AUD].

We have, for each [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

In order to cover Ω, we can for each fixed h apparently do this with a finite union of [formula] sets. The smallest j1 required for the covering will go like O(h) and the smallest j2 like [formula]. For large h, the diameter of the [formula] sets will go uniformly like [formula], so we can fit them in balls of equal radius which tends to zero as h  →    ∞  . We realize that what is left to check is [\eqref=eq:AUDequation].

For covering [formula] sets, let [formula] be chosen such that [formula] does not intersect ∂Ω, i.e., For such [formula]'s we have the Lebesgue measures

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Since the smallest j2 goes like [formula], we must uniformly have that for any [formula], as h  →    ∞  . This implies where ε  =  ε(h)  →  0 as h  →    ∞  .

In virtue of Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdastronglytwoscale], we thus get Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdastronglytwoscaleex].

The sequence {τh} defined by where {αh} is given by [\eqref=eq:alphahexample], is strongly two-scale compatible with respect to [formula].

Use Proposition [\ref=prop:AUDexample] together with Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdastronglytwoscale].

Define the 2-tuple ζ according to

[formula]

and define the diagonal matrix Π element-wise by Proposition [\ref=prop:typeHex] below shows that {αh} is of right type to use in Theorem [\ref=theo:lambdahomo] for the homogenization to work out properly.

The sequence {αh} given by [\eqref=eq:alphahexample] is of type [formula], where ζ is given by [\eqref=eq:diagonalmatrix].

We must check conditions (i)-(iii) of Definition [\ref=def:typeH]. Condition (i) is an immediate consequence of Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdastronglytwoscaleex]. For condition (ii), we note that and by choosing for which ph  →  0 in H1(Ω), we get We obviously have that ζ∈L∞(Ω)2. Finally, we must check condition (iii) of Definition [\ref=def:typeH]. In this context, it means that we must find a Banach space [formula] for which [formula] is dense in Z, and such that, for any [formula],

[formula]

as h  →    ∞  . If we define

[formula]

we clearly have, for any [formula], a satisfied weak convergence [\eqref=eq:weakconvzeta]. What is left to prove is the density of [formula] in Z, where Z is given by [\eqref=eq:Zspace]. We apparently have

[formula]

and since [formula] is dense in [formula], it is easy to check that we have the desired density of [formula] in Z.

To obtain the orthogonal complement, we need Lemma [\ref=lem:orthcompl] [\cite=Ngu89].

Assume that Y is a unit cube in [formula]. Let [formula] be orthogonal to the space of divergence free functions. Then, for some [formula],

We are now ready to characterize the orthogonal complement.

The orthogonal complement [formula] of Z, defined in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:typeHex], is

Suppose v∈Z and [formula]. Then, by definition,

[formula]

Since Lemma [\ref=lem:orthcompl] implies that, for some [formula] a.e. x∈Ω, Hence, for some [formula] a.e. x∈Ω, We know that [formula], so [formula] holds. This implies

[formula]

where we have recalled that Ω  =  (a1,b1)  ×  (a2,b2). Thus, [formula], and we conclude that and we are done.

We can now formulate a preliminary homogenization result in Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdahomoex].

Assume and let {αh} and ζ be given by [\eqref=eq:alphahexample] and [\eqref=eq:diagonalmatrix], respectively. Then [formula] H-converges to B given by

[formula]

u∈H10(Ω) being the weak limit of the sequence {uh} of solutions to [\eqref=eq:PDEseq], if u∈H10(Ω) and [formula] uniquely solve the homogenized problem

[formula]

for all v∈H10(Ω), and, for each x∈Ω, the local problem

[formula]

for all [formula].

This is an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=theo:lambdahomo] together with Proposition [\ref=prop:typeHex] and Proposition [\ref=prop:orthocomplex].

It is possible to improve Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdahomoex] to yield an explicit homogenized matrix and a local problem of the same type as in Theorem [\ref=theo:elliptichomo]. Indeed, we have Theorem [\ref=theo:lambdahomoex]. [formula]

The proof will be performed in four steps, where the first step introduces an ansatz, the second and third steps derive the homogenized matrix [\eqref=eq:homogenizedmatrix] and the local problem [\eqref=eq:localproblemex], respectively. In the last step we prove the uniqueness of the solution to the local problem.

Step (i): Ansatz. Let u∈H10(Ω) and [formula] solve the system of equations in Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdahomoex], and make the ansatz

[formula]

where [formula]. We will see later why it is necessary that we must constrain ourselves to [formula] a.e. [formula].

Step (ii): Homogenized matrix. Let us first derive the expression [\eqref=eq:homogenizedmatrix] for the homogenized matrix. From [\eqref=eq:flowhomoex] and [\eqref=eq:ansatz] we get which is satisfied if where we note that B∈L∞(Ω)2  ×  2, which requires [formula] a.e. [formula].

Step (iii): Local problem. Next, let us derive the local problem [\eqref=eq:localproblemex]. Fix some [formula] to be used in the local problem [\eqref=eq:localprob] in Proposition [\ref=prop:lambdahomoex], whose left-hand side becomes, for each x∈Ω,

[formula]

This must be zero, which is the case if, for each x∈Ω, By partial integrating and using the divergence theorem, we obtain, for each x∈Ω,

[formula]

where n is the unit outward normal to ∂Y. Since v is Y-periodic, the surface integral vanishes, and we are left with, for each x∈Ω, which certainly is satisfied if, for each x∈Ω, and we have shown [\eqref=eq:localproblemex].

Step (iv): Uniqueness. It remains to prove the uniqueness of the solution to the local problem. Fixing x∈Ω, we can define a new, rescaled, y-variable yζ(x) by letting The new local problem can be written effectively a "classical" local problem, where the 2  ×  2 matrix Aζ(x) and the 2-tuple zζ(x) are given according to and [formula]. Since uniqueness is ensured just as in the "classical" case.

A numerical illustration

As an illustration of the theoretical results of Section [\ref=sec:nonpertwodimex], consider the sequence of problems [\eqref=eq:PDEseq] with [formula] where A is given as a product between a scalar factor and a unit matrix according to and let Ω  =  (δ,2)2 where [formula]. Apparently, so Theorem [\ref=theo:lambdahomoex] is applicable. Furthermore, see Figure [\ref=fig:scalarfactor]. By using [\eqref=eq:localproblemex], the local problem for z becomes, for each x∈Ω,

[formula]

where the matrix C and the 2-tuple g are given by

[formula]

respectively. Solving [\eqref=eq:heateqlocprob] numerically (effectively we have a one-parameter family, with respect to x2, of partial differential equations to solve) and then computing the homogenized matrix through [\eqref=eq:homogenizedmatrix], we get that B is diagonal with non-vanishing entries, functions with respect to x2 only, given according to Figure [\ref=fig:homomatrixcomp]. Note the interesting feature that b11|x2  =  1 / 2  =  b22|x2  =  1 / 2, where B obviously is proportional to the unit matrix, i.e., along the line [formula], the homogenized matrix is isotropic. The heuristic explanation to this is simple; for large h the mapped periodicity cells in the vicinity of the line [formula] are near-perfect squares. Of course, it is crucial that A is isotropic to begin with in order for the map [formula] to exhibit a near-isotropy property on such mapped, near-perfect squares.
