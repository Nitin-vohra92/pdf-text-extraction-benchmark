Heavy flavour in ALICE

Introduction

ALICE [\cite=alicePPR1] [\cite=alicePPR2] is the dedicated heavy-ion experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The main physics goal of the experiment is the study of strongly-interacting matter in the conditions of high energy density ([formula]) and high temperature ([formula]), expected to be reached in central Pb-Pb collisions at [formula]. Under these conditions, according to lattice QCD calculations, quark confinement into colourless hadrons should be removed and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma should be formed [\cite=alicePPR1].

Heavy-flavour particles are regarded as effective probes of the system conditions. In particular:

open charm and beauty hadrons would be sensitive to the energy density, through the mechanism of in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks;

quarkonium states would be sensitive to the initial temperature of the system through their dissociation due to colour screening.

Heavy-flavour phenomenology in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC

The expected [formula] and [formula] production yields for pp collisions at [formula] are 0.16 and 0.0072, respectively [\cite=alicePPR2]. For the 5% most central Pb-Pb collisions at [formula] the expected yields are 115 and 4.6, respectively. These numbers, assumed as the baseline for ALICE simulation studies, are obtained from pQCD calculations at NLO [\cite=hvqmnr], including the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions in the Pb nucleus. Note that the predicted yields have large uncertainties, of about a factor 2, estimated by varying the values of the calculation parameters.

Experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have shown that the nuclear modification factor of particles pt distributions, [formula], is a sensitive observable for the study of the interaction of the hard partons with the medium produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Heavy quark medium-induced quenching is one of the most captivating topics to be addressed in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Due to the QCD nature of parton energy loss, quarks are predicted to lose less energy than gluons (that have a higher colour charge) and, in addition, the 'dead-cone effect' is expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks with respect to light partons [\cite=dk]. Therefore, one should observe a pattern of gradually decreasing RAA suppression when going from the mostly gluon-originated light-flavour hadrons (h± or π0) to D and to B mesons: [formula]. The measurement of D and B meson production cross sections will also serve as a baseline for the study of medium effects on quarkonia. Two of the most interesting items in the quarkonia sector at the LHC will be: (a) understanding the interplay between colour-screening-induced (and medium-temperature-dependent) suppression and statistical regeneration for J/ψ production in a medium containing on the order of 100 [formula] pairs; (b) measuring for the first time medium effects on the bottomonia resonances, expected to be affected by colour-screening only if the temperature of the medium will be larger than about 0.4 GeV.

Heavy-flavour detection in ALICE

The ALICE experimental setup, described in detail in [\cite=alicePPR1], allows the detection of open charm and beauty hadrons and of quarkonia in the high-multiplicity environment of central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energy, where a few thousand charged particles might be produced per unit of rapidity. The heavy-flavour capability of the ALICE detector is provided by:

Tracking system; the Inner Tracking System (ITS), the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), embedded in a magnetic field of 0.5 T, allow track reconstruction in the pseudorapidity range - 0.9 < η < 0.9 with a momentum resolution better than 2% for [formula] and a transverse impact parameter resolution better than [formula] for [formula] (the two innermost layers of the ITS, r  ≈  4 and [formula], are equipped with silicon pixel detectors).

Particle identification system; charged hadrons are separated via dE / dx in the TPC and via time-of-flight measurement in the Time Of Flight (TOF) detector; electrons are separated from charged hadrons in the dedicated Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), and in the TPC; muons are identified in the muon spectrometer covering the pseudo-rapidity range - 4 < η <  - 2.5.

Simulation studies [\cite=alicePPR2] have shown that ALICE has good potential to carry out a rich heavy-flavour physics programme. The main analyses in preparation are:

Open charm (section [\ref=open]): fully reconstructed hadronic decays D0  →  K-π+, D+  →  K-π+π+, D+s  →  K-K+π+ (under study), Λ+c  →  pK-π+ (under study) in |η| < 0.9.

Open beauty (section [\ref=open]): inclusive single leptons B   →   e + X in |η| < 0.9 and B   →   μ + X in - 4 < η <  - 2.5; inclusive displaced charmonia B   →   J  /  ψ  (   →   e + e - ) + X (under study).

Quarkonia (section [\ref=quarkonia]): [formula] (J/ψ, [formula]) and [formula] (Υ, [formula], [formula]) states in the e + e -  (|η| < 0.9) and μ+μ- (- 4 < η <  - 2.5) channels.

For all simulation studies, a multiplicity dNch  /  dy = 4000-6000 was assumed for central Pb-Pb collisions. In the following, we report the results corresponding to the expected statistics collected by ALICE per LHC year: 107 central (0-5% σinel) Pb-Pb events at [formula] and 109 pp events at [formula], in the barrel detectors; the forward muon arm will collect about 40 times larger samples of muon-trigger events (i.e.  4  ×  108 central Pb-Pb events).

Charm and beauty measurements

Among the most promising channels for open charm detection are the D0  →  K-π+ ([formula], branching ratio ≈  3.8%) and D+  →  K-π+π+ ([formula], branching ratio ≈  9.2%) decays. The detection strategy to cope with the large combinatorial background from the underlying event is based on the selection of displaced-vertex topologies, i.e. separation from the primary vertex of the tracks from the secondary vertex and good alignment between the reconstructed D meson momentum and flight-line [\cite=alicePPR2] [\cite=elena]. An invariant-mass analysis is used to extract the raw signal yield, to be then corrected for selection and reconstruction efficiency and for detector acceptance. The accessible pt range for the [formula] is 1-[formula] in Pb-Pb and 0.5-[formula] in pp, with statistical errors better than 15-20% at high pt. Similar capability is expected for the D+. The systematic errors (acceptance and efficiency corrections, centrality selection for Pb-Pb) are expected to be smaller than 20%.

The production of open beauty can be studied by detecting the semi-electronic decays of beauty hadrons, mostly B mesons. Such decays have a branching ratio of ≃10%. The main sources of background electrons are: decays of D mesons; π0 Dalitz decays and decays of light vector mesons (e.g. ρ and ω); conversions of photons in the beam pipe or in the inner detector layer; pions misidentified as electrons. Given that electrons from beauty have average impact parameter [formula] and a hard pt spectrum, it is possible to obtain a high-purity sample with a strategy that relies on: electron identification with a combined dE / dx (TPC) and transition radiation (TRD) selection; impact parameter cut to reduce the charm-decay component and reject misidentified π± and e± from Dalitz decays and γ conversions. As an example, with 107 central Pb-Pb events, this strategy is expected to allow the measurement of electron-level pt-differential cross section in the range [formula] with statistical errors smaller than 15% at high pt. Similar performance figures are expected for pp collisions.

B production in pp and Pb-Pb collisions can be measured also in the ALICE muon spectrometer (- 4 < η <  - 2.5) analyzing the single-muon pt distribution [\cite=alicePPR2]. The main backgrounds to the 'beauty muon' signal are π±, K± and charm decays. The cut [formula] is applied to all reconstructed muons in order to increase the signal-to-background ratio. Then, a fit technique allows to extract a pt distribution of muons from B decays. Since only minimal cuts are applied, the statistical errors are expected to be smaller than 5% up to muon [formula].

We investigated the possibility of using the described charm and beauty measurements to study the high-pt suppression induced by parton energy loss. The sensitivity to RDAA and Re ~ from ~ BAA is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:RAA]. Predictions [\cite=adsw] with and without the effect of the heavy-quark mass, for a medium transport coefficient [formula] (a measurement of the medium density) in the range 25-[formula], are also shown.

Quarkonia capabilities

ALICE can detect quarkonia in the dielectron channel at central rapidity ([formula]) and in the dimuon channel at forward rapidity ([formula]). In both channels the quarkonia acceptance extends down to zero transverse momentum, since the minimum pt for e and μ identification is about [formula]. The high pt reach is expected to be 10 (20) [formula] for the J/ψ in e+e- (μ+μ-), for a Pb-Pb run of one month at nominal luminosity. In the bottomonium sector, the mass resolution of about [formula] at [formula], for both dielectrons and dimuons, should allow the separation of the Υ and [formula] states, and thus the measurement of the [formula] ratio, which is expected to be sensitive to the initial temperature of the medium.

Simulation studies are in progress to prepare a measurement of the fraction of J/ψ that feed-down from B decays. Such measurement can be performed by studying the separation of the dilepton pairs in the J/ψ invariant mass region from the main interaction vertex. The analysis is also expected to provide a measurement of the beauty pt-differential cross section.

Summary

Heavy quarks, abundantly produced at LHC energies, will allow to address several issues at the heart of in heavy-ion physics. They provide tools to probe the density (via parton energy loss and its predicted mass dependence) and the temperature (via the dissociation patterns of quarkonia) of the high-density QCD medium formed in Pb-Pb collisions. The excellent tracking, vertexing and particle identification performance of ALICE will allow to fully explore this rich phenomenology.
