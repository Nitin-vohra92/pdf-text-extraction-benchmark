ABSTRACT

We obtain smooth M-theory solutions whose geometry is a warped product of AdS5 and a compact internal space that can be viewed as an S4 bundle over S2. The bundle can be trivial or twisted, depending on the even or odd values of the two diagonal monopole charges. The solution preserves N = 2 supersymmetry and is dual to an N = 1 D = 4 superconformal field theory, providing a concrete framework to study the AdS5/CFT4 correspondence in M-theory. We construct analogous embeddings of AdS4, AdS3 and AdS2 in massive type IIA, type IIB and M-theory, respectively. The internal spaces have generalized holonomy and can be viewed as Sn bundles over S2 for n = 4, 5 and 7. Surprisingly, the dimensions of spaces with generalized holonomy includes D = 9. We also obtain a large class of solutions of AdS×  H2.

Introduction

AdS5 spacetime arises naturally in type IIB supergravity, which provides a non-trivial and relatively simple framework for examining the holographic principle via the AdS5/CFT4 correspondence [\cite=malda] [\cite=gkp] [\cite=wit]. The embedding of AdS5 spacetime in eleven-dimensional supergravity has also been studied in the past. A smooth but non-supersymmetric compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity to AdS5 was obtained in [\cite=pn] where the internal space is a Kähler manifold. More recently, an internal background of [formula] was found in [\cite=dlp]. Although the compactification is not supersymmetric at the level of supergravity, it was argued in [\cite=dlp] that it is fully supersymmetric at the level of M-theory, since it is T-dual to the AdS5  ×  S5 of type IIB theory. In the above two examples, the AdS spacetime and internal manifold are direct products without warp factors. Smooth but non-supersymmetric M-theory solutions have been constructed in [\cite=gauntlett1], which are warped and twisted products of AdS5  ×  S2 or AdS5  ×  H2 with a squashed four-sphere.

In [\cite=ali] [\cite=oz], supersymmetric embeddings of AdS5 in M-theory were found as warped geometries with a compact internal metric. This construction can be understood from that the fact that S5 can be expressed as a foliation of S3 and S1. One can then T-dualize the AdS5  ×  S5 of type IIB theory on the U(1) bundle of the S3 and obtain a solution in M-theory [\cite=clpv]. However, there is a naked singularity in such a construction, since the U(1) circle of the S3 can shrink to zero. Supersymmetric and smooth embeddings of AdS5 in M-theory were obtained in [\cite=mn1]. The eleven-dimensional metric is a warped product of AdS5 with an internal metric that can be viewed as an S4 bundle over H2, a hyperbolic 2-plane. The construction can give rise to both N = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetry.

In this letter, we report a supersymmetric and smooth compactification of M-theory to AdS5, with the internal space being an S4 bundle over S2. The construction is only possible for N = 2 supersymmetry, and hence it gives rise to the minimum AdS5 gauged supergravity coupled to matter. This solution provides a supergravity dual to N = 1 D = 4 superconformal field theory. We also obtain supersymmetric and smooth compactifications of M-theory to AdS2 and type IIB to AdS3. The internal space is an Sp bundle over S2, where p = 7 and 5, respectively. We also construct a supersymmetric compactification of massive IIA to AdS4, which is singular.

AdS5  ×  S2 in M-theory

We begin by considering the sector of D = 7 gauged supergravity with two diagonal U(1) vector fields. The relevant Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

where [formula] with

[formula]

The scalar potential V̂ is given by [\cite=tenauthors]

[formula]

where X0 = (X1  X2)- 2. The potential can be expressed in terms of the superpotential

[formula]

We now consider a 3-brane ansatz

[formula]

where the constant ε takes the values 1, - 1 and 0, if dΩ22 is the metric for a unit S2, hyperbolic H2 or 2-torus T2. [formula] is the corresponding volume form. The system admits the following first-order equations

[formula]

provided that the constraint

[formula]

is satisfied. This set of first-order equations were derived for the case of H2 in [\cite=mn1] by studying the Killing spinor equations of D = 7 gauged supergravity. In [\cite=clvs2], a different method was used to obtain them for H2, S2 and T2. The equations of ([\ref=d7fo]) were analysed in detail in [\cite=clvs2]. Here, we report on only a subclass of solutions where [formula] and v are constants. In this case, for ε = 0, the solution is nothing but AdS7 written in Poincaré coordinates.

For ε  =    ±  1, we find that the solution is given by

[formula]

This solution is invariant under the simultaneous interchanges of m1  ↔  m2 and φ1  ↔    -  φ1. The reality conditions of the solution constrain the constants mi and g, as well as the choice of ±   in the solution. Let us first consider the case ε =  - 1, corresponding to dΩ22 as the metric of a unit (non-compact) hyperbolic 2-plane. In this case, the reality of the solution implies that m1  m2  ≥  0. This includes the choice of m1 = 0 (or m2 = 0) and m1 = m2, which were discussed in [\cite=mn1]. The first case gives rise to N = 4 supersymmetry in D = 5, whilst the second case gives rise to N = 2 supersymmetry.

We are particularly interested in a compact internal space. Thus, we now turn to the choice of ε =  + 1, corresponding to dΩ22 as the metric of S2. In this case, the reality conditions for ([\ref=d7sol]) imply that m1  m2 < 0. The condition ([\ref=d7con]) implies further that m1  ≠   - m2. Therefore, the AdS5  ×  S2 solution can only have N = 2 supersymmetry, but cannot arise from the pure D = 7 minimal gauged supergravity.

If we define a charge parameter q = 2m1 / (m1  +  m2), then the condition for having S2 versus H2 can be summarised as

[formula]

It is straightforward to lift this solution to D = 11 by using the ansatz obtained in [\cite=tenauthors]. Since the solutions for general mi are rather complicated to present, we only consider a representative example with m1 = 5g and m2 =  - 3g. The M-theory metric is given by

[formula]

where c = 10- 2 / 5 and μi are spherical coordinates which satisfy μ20  +  μ21  +  μ22 = 1. The warp factor Δ is given by

[formula]

The AdS5 metric is given by

[formula]

where the AdS radius is given by [formula]. The 4-form field strength in D = 11 can also be obtained using the reduction ansatz in [\cite=tenauthors]. It is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the volume form for the AdS5 metric.

Thus, the internal space of the D = 11 metric can be viewed as an S4 bundle over S2, with two diagonal U(1) bundles. In general, the internal metric can be labeled by [formula]. In the specific example above, (q1,q2) = (5, - 3) and the solution is smooth everywhere. For general (m1,m2), the metric does not have a power-law singularity. However, it could have a conical orbifold singularity, which is absent only if (q1,q2) are integers. Since the qi satisfy the constraint q1  +  q2 = 2, it follows that they are either both even or both odd integers. In the even case, the bundle is topologically trivial, whilst it is twisted for the odd case.

AdS4  ×  S2 in massive type IIA

The scalar potential in gauged supergravity with two U(1) isometries was obtained in [\cite=gubser]. From this, we deduce that the relevant Lagrangian involving the two U(1) vector fields is given by

[formula]

where [formula] with

[formula]

The scalar potential is given by

[formula]

where X0 = (X1  X2)- 3 / 2. As in the previous case, the scalar potential can be expressed in terms of the superpotential

[formula]

We consider a membrane solution of the type given by ([\ref=braneansatz]). The system admits the following first-order equations

[formula]

provided that the constraint λ2 = (m1 + m2)g is satisfied. The solutions were analysed in detail in [\cite=clvs2]. Here, we shall only consider the subset of solutions with constant scalars. For ε = 0, one just reproduces the AdS6 metric in Poincaré coordinates. For ε  =    ±  1, we have

[formula]

As in the D = 7 result, we can define a charge parameter [formula]. We have H2 or S2 depending on the following condition:

[formula]

When q = 0 or q = 2, the system has N = 4 supersymmetry. Otherwise, we have N = 2 supersymmetry.

Using the reduction ansatz in [\cite=gubser] [\cite=massive], it is straightforward to lift the solution back to D = 10, giving rise to a solution of massive type IIA supergravity. The metric is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Thus, the D = 10 metric is a warped product of AdS4 with an internal six-metric, which is an S4 bundle over S2 or H2, depending on the charge parameter p, according to the rule ([\ref=d6rule]).

As an example of a supersymmetric, though singular, compactification of AdS4 from massive IIA, we can take m1 = 7g and m2 =  - 5g, and a choice of negative sign in ([\ref=ads4omega2]). This gives X0 = 6c, X1 = 7c and X2 = c, where c = 6- 1 / 4  7- 3 / 8. Also, [formula] and [formula], and the radius of AdS4 is given by R = 1 / (2c  g).

AdS3  ×  S2 in type IIB

Let us now consider the D = 5 minimal gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets. The Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

where [formula] with

[formula]

The scalar potential is given by

[formula]

The scalar potential V̂ can also be expressed in terms of the superpotential

[formula]

We find that the string solution of the type given by ([\ref=braneansatz]) admits the following first-order equations

[formula]

provided that the constraint λ2 = (m1 + m2 + m3)g is satisfied. The general solution for this system was analysed in [\cite=clvs2]. Here, we consider only the solutions with constant scalar fields. For ε = 0, the solution is AdS5 in Poincaré coordinates. For ε  =    ±  1, fixed-point solutions exist only for non-vanishing mi. The solution is given by

[formula]

The reality condition of the solution implies that when three vectors with the magnitudes |mi| can form a triangle, dΩ22 should be the H2 metric. On the other hand, when they cannot form a triangle, the metric should be that of S2. If any of the mi vanish, there is no fixed-point solution, except when one vanishes with the remaining two equal [\cite=clvs2].

Using the reduction ansatz obtained in [\cite=tenauthors], we can easily lift the solution back to D = 10. Since the solution with general mi is complicated to present, we consider a simpler case with m2 = m1. The D = 10 type IIB metric is

[formula]

where

[formula]

We have introduced the charge parameters qi = 2mi / (m1  +  m2  +  m3), and hence they satisfy the constraint q1  +  q2  +  q3 = 2. In the above solution, if |m3| < 2|m1|, we should have ε =  - 1, corresponding to H2; if |m3| > 2|m1|, we should have ε = 1, corresponding to S2. In general, the internal metric is an S5 bundle over S2 or H2, depending the values of the qi according to the above rules.

AdS2  ×  S2 in M-theory

Let us now consider the U(1)4 gauged N = 2 supergravity in four dimensions. The Lagrangian is given by

[formula]

where [formula] with

[formula]

The scalar potential is given by

[formula]

which can also be expressed in terms of the superpotential

[formula]

The magnetic black hole solution of the type given by ([\ref=braneansatz]) admits the following first-order equations

[formula]

provided that the constraint [formula] is satisfied. The general solution for this system was analysed in [\cite=clvs2]. Here, we consider only solutions with constant scalar fields. For ε = 0, the solution is AdS4 in Poincaré coordinates. For ε  =    ±  1, we have not obtained the general solution for abitrary mi, although we have found many examples of specific solutions. We do find a class of special solutions by setting m2 = m3 = m4. This enables us to consistently set [formula]. For this truncation, fixed-point solutions for ε  =    ±  1 are given by

[formula]

The reality condition of the solution implies that for ε =  - 1, corresponding to H2, we must have either m2 > 0 and 0 < m1  ≤  m2 or m2 < 0 and m2  ≤  m1  <   - 3m2. For ε = 1, corresponding to S2, we must have m2  ≤  0 and m1 >  - 3m2. The AdS2  ×  H2 has also been found in [\cite=gauntlett2].

Using the reduction ansatz obtained in [\cite=tenauthors], we can easily lift the solution back to D = 11 with the metric

[formula]

where

[formula]

In general, the internal metric is an S7 bundle over S2 or H2, depending the values of the mi.

Conclusions

We have obtained a large class of supersymmetric embeddings of AdS spacetime in M-theory, as well as type IIB and massive type IIA theories. The internal spaces can be viewed as Sn bundles over S2 or H2. Similar solutions have been discussed in [\cite=gauntlett3] [\cite=gauntlett4] [\cite=gauntlett5]. In particular, we have found a smooth embedding of AdS5 in M-theory, with a compact internal space of an S4 bundle over S2. The bundle can be trivial or twisted, depending on the two diagonal monopole charges. The solution preserves N = 2 supersymmetry; it is a supergravity dual to an N = 1, D = 4 superconformal field theory on the boundary of AdS5. This provides a concrete framework to study AdS5/CFT4 from the point of view of M-theory.

The internal spaces of these embeddings may be regarded as concrete realisations of spaces with generalized holonomy groups advocated in [\cite=duffliu], since they are not Ricci flat and involve a form field. An especially interesting example is the S7 bundle over S2 or H2, which is nine-dimensional. While nine-dimensional Ricci-flat manifolds do not have an irreducible special holonomy group, our aforementioned solutions are explicit examples of nine-dimensional spaces which have generalized special holonomy.

The embeddings of AdS spacetimes in M-theory and string theories discussed in this paper all involve warp factors. We expect that there are many further examples of such solutions. It is of interest to explore them, both from the AdS/CFT perspective as well as for a more concrete understanding and classification of spaces with generalized special holonomy.
