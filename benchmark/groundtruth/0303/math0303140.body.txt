Intersection Cohomology of [formula]-Actions on Pseudomanifolds

Foreword

For an entire version of this article the reader should go better to Indag. Math. Vol. 15 (3), 383-412.

A pseudomanifold is a topological space X with two features. First, there is a closed Σ  ⊂  X called the singular part, which is the disjoint union of smooth manifolds. The X - Σ is a dense smooth manifold. We call strata the connected components of Σ and X - Σ; they constitute a locally finite partition of X. The second feature is the local conical behavior of X, the model being a product U  ×  c(L) of a smooth manifold U with the open cone of a compact smooth manifold L called the link of U. A careful reader will notice that stratified pseudomanifolds with arbitrary length have a richer and more complicated topological structure; in this article we deal with stratified pseudomanifolds of length [formula], which we call just pseudomanifolds.

Between the various ways for defining the intersection (co)homology; the reader can see [\cite=gm1],[\cite=borel2] for a definition in pl-stratified pseudomanifolds; [\cite=borel],[\cite=gm2],[\cite=pervsheaves] for a definition with sheaves; [\cite=nagase] for an approach with L2-cohomology; [\cite=brylinsky] for an exposition in Thom-Mather spaces.

In this article, we use the DeRham-like definition exposed in [\cite=illinois] where the reader will find a beautiful proof of the DeRham theorem for stratified spaces. We work with differential forms in X - Σ and measure their behavior when approaching to Σ, trough an auxiliary construction called an unfolding of X. Although X may have many different unfoldings, its intersection cohomology does not depend on any particular choice. This point of view is the dual of the intersection homology defined by King [\cite=king], who works with a broader family of perversities. When [formula] acts on X preserving the local structure then the orbit space [formula] is again a pseudomanifold with an unfolding.

The well known Gysin sequence of a smooth manifold M with a principal action of [formula] is the long exact sequence

[formula]

where π* is induced by the orbit map [formula], which is a smooth [formula]-principal bundle. The map [formula] is induced by the integration along the fibers and the connecting homomorphism ε is the multiplication by the Euler class [formula].

When the action of [formula] on M is not free then the base space is not anymore a smooth manifold, but a stratified pseudomanifold [formula] whose length depends on the number of orbit types. There is a Gysin sequence of M relating the DeRham cohomology of M with the intersection cohomology of [formula]

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] are perversities in [formula]. The connecting homomorphism is again the multiplication by the Euler class [formula]. The fixed points' subspace [formula] is naturally contained in [formula]. The link of a fixed stratum [formula] is always a cohomological complex projective space [\cite=S1],[\cite=coloquio_santiago].

In this article we extend the above situation for any pseudomanifold X and any action of [formula] on X preserving the local structure. The orbit map [formula] induces a long exact sequence

[formula]

relating the intersection cohomologies of X and [formula] with a third term [formula] whose cohomology can be given in terms of local and global basic cohomological data; we call it the Gysin term. The above long exact sequence is the Gysin sequence.

Global data concerns the Euler class [formula]. For instance, if ε = 0 then [formula] where [formula] is the perversity defined by

[formula]

The connecting homomorphism ∂ of the Gysin sequence depends on the Euler class, though it's not the multiplication. The Euler class vanishes if and only if there is a foliation on X - Σ transverse to the orbits of the action [\cite=JI1], [\cite=euler_class].

Local data relates the Gysin term with the fixed strata. In general, there is a second long exact sequence

[formula]

the residual term satisfying

[formula]

where S runs over the fixed strata and [formula] is the cohomology of S with values on a locally trivial constructible presheaf [\cite=borel2] [formula] with stalk

[formula]

the image of the multiplication by the Euler class [formula] of the action on the Link L of S. Since L may not be a sphere, this term could not vanish.
