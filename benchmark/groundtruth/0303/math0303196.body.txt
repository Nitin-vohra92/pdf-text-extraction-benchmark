Introduction

In this note we study irregular higher dimensional complex projective manifolds X whose canonical map [formula] has a one dimensional image. Hence replacing X by some blowing up, the canonical map factors through a surjection f:X  →  C to a curve C with connected fibres. We will call f:X  →  C the canonical fibration of X.

As shown by G. Xiao [\cite=X1] if the canonical system of a surface S of general type is composite with a pencil, then q(S)  ≤  2. Moreover this pencil is rational if and only if q(S) = 2.

Before formulating some generalizations to higher dimensional manifolds, let us recall that the Albanese dimension [formula] of a manifold X, is defined to be the dimension of the image of the Albanese map [formula]. X is said to be of maximal Albanese dimension if a(X) =  dim (X). Remark that the Kodaira dimension [formula] is always supposed to be the Kodaira dimension of a nonsingular model of [formula].

Let X be a projective manifold of maximal Albanese dimension. Assume the canonical system is composite with a pencil, and let f:X  →  C be the canonical fibration, with general fibre F.

If q(X) >  dim (X), then

[formula]

If q(X) =  dim (X), then [formula].

Let X be a projective manifold whose canonical linear system is composite with a pencil. Assume that

[formula]

and that [formula]. Let F denote the general fibre of the canonical fibration f:X  →  C. Then pg(F) = 1, and f is the composition of [formula] with the Ueno map [formula] (cf. ([\ref=prop])). Moreover  pg(X) + 1  ≥  g(C)  ≥  2, and [formula]

So the assumptions made in Theorem [\ref=thm1], (i), and in Theorem [\ref=thm2] imply that the image C of the canonical fibration f is a curve positive genus, hence the universal property of the Albanese map implies that the canonical fibration factors through the Albanese map. For threefolds with q(X)  ≥  5, one has a similar property.

Let X be a threefold of general type, whose canonical linear system is composite with a pencil. Assume either one of the following conditions:

q(X)  ≥  5.

q(X)  ≥  4 and X is of maximal Albanese dimension.

q(X)  ≥  4 and [formula] is a surface of Kodaira dimension 1.

q(X)  ≥  3 and [formula] is a curve.

Then the Stein factorization of the Albanese map [formula] factors through the canonical fibration.

Of course, parts b), c) and d) in [\ref=3thm] are just [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=thm2], respectively. We do not know, whether the image of the canonical fibration can be [formula] under the assumption a).

The bound q(X)  ≥  5 is the best possible. In Section [\ref=gt] we give examples of projective n-folds X of general type with q(X) = 2n - 2 and

[formula]

whose canonical fibration is a morphism [formula]. If h:X  →  Y denotes the Stein factorization of [formula], then the induced map [formula] is generically finite. In those examples the geometric genus of a general fiber F of f is pg(F) = 2n - 1 + 1 > 1.

It is an open question whether there exists a constant c(n), depending only n, such that for all n-dimensional manifolds with q(X)  ≥  c(n), pg(X)  ≥  2 and a(X) <  dim (X), the morphism [formula] induced by the Stein factorization X  →  Z of the canonical map and the Albanese map, is never surjective.

In Section [\ref=q=dim] we will consider projective manifolds of general type and maximal Albanese dimension with q(X) =  dim (X) whose canonical system is composite with a pencil (Examples [\ref=e1] and [\ref=ex1]).

For a projective variety X' we write pg(X'), and q(X') for the geometric genus and the irregularity of any smooth model X of X', respectively. At several places we change the smooth birational model X. In particular we will always assume that the canonical map ΦX is a morphism. We will say that the canonical fibration is a (rational / irrational) pencil, whenever the canonical linear system is composite with a pencil (and the image of the canonical fibration a rational / non-rational curve).

Manifolds of maximal Albanese dimension

Recall a well-known result on the geometry of subvarieties of an Abelian variety.

Let A be an Abelian variety, and Y  ⊂  A an irreducible reduced subvariety. Let A0 be the connected component of {a∈A; a + Y = Y} containing the origin. Then A0 is an Abelian subvariety of A, and

[formula]

is an étale fiber bundle with fiber A0. Moreover B is of general type, uY is the canonical map and it is birational to the Iitaka fibration of Y.

We will call uY:Y  →  B = Y / A0 the Ueno map.

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] we need two simple observations.

Let α:X  →  Y be a generically finite surjective morphism of projective manifolds. Then, ωY is a direct factor of α*ωX.

The statement is compatible with blowing up X and Y, hence one may assume the branch locus Δ of α to be a normal crossing divisor. Let

[formula]

be the Stein factorization of α. Then Z has at most quotient singularities and hence rational singularities (cf. e.g., [\cite=EV], Lemma 3.24), and g*ωX  =  ωZ. Duality for finite morphisms (see [\cite=Ha], Ex. II 6.10, and [\cite=Ha], Ex. III 7.2) implies

[formula]

so α*ωX contains HomY(OY,ωY) = ωY as a direct factor.

Let X be a projective manifold with [formula]. Assume that the canonical fibration f:X  →  C is a pencil with general fiber F.

If [formula], then either pg(F) = 1 or pg(F) = pg(X) = g(C) = 2.

Since [formula], we have pg(F) > 0. Assume that pg(F)  ≠  1. Since ΦX factors through f, the moving part of |KX| is given by f*L for some invertible subsheaf L of f*ωX, splitting locally and of strictly positive degree; thus

[formula]

Consider the exact sequence of sheaves

[formula]

By the choice of L the sheaf Q is locally free of rank pg(F) - 1. By [\cite=Fu] the sheaf [formula] is nef, hence [formula]. The Riemann-Roch Theorem for locally free sheaves on C implies that Then pg(F) = 2 and h1(L) = g(C) - 1, hence h0(L) =  deg (L). By Clifford's Theorem deg (L) = 2 and L≃ωC. So pg(X) = g(C) = 2.

Blowing up X, if necessary, we may assume that the Albanese map [formula] factors like

[formula]

for some desingularization Y of [formula]. In particular, by [\ref=trace] there exists some torsion-free sheaf G with [formula]. So the canonical map ΦY factors through ΦX, hence through the canonical fibration f:X  →  C, and the image of ΦY must be a curve B. By [\ref=prop] ΦY:Y  →  B is birational to an étale fibre bundle of Abelian subvarieties of [formula] of dimension dim (Y) - 1 =  dim (X) - 1, and q(X) = g(B) +  dim (X) - 1. On the other hand, the general fibre F of f is of maximal Albanese dimension, and its image in [formula] is an Abelian subvariety. Hence q(X)  ≥  g(C)  +   dim (F) and g(C)  ≤  g(B). Since C is a covering of B, this is only possible for B = C and g(C) = g(B)  ≥  2. Let us write ι:Y  →  C, such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=prop], if pg(F)  ≠  1 one has

[formula]

So [formula], and ι*G is an invertible sheaf. Since f*ωX / C is nef, [formula] is nef, and the Riemann-Roch Theorem implies h0(i*G) > 0, or

[formula]

a contradiction.

Since F is of maximal Albanese dimension pg(F) = 1 implies that q(F) =  dim (F) and χ(OF) = 0 (see [\cite=Ue]). The restriction map

[formula]

is surjective. By the generic vanishing theorem ([\cite=GL] or [\cite=EL]), for a general [formula] the sheaf [formula] has no higher cohomology, hence

[formula]

Tensoring the exact sequences

[formula]

with L, one obtains by descending induction on n that [formula]. Using again the generic vanishing theorem ([\cite=GL] or [\cite=EL]) one finds χ(OX) = 0.

When dim (X) = 3, hence dim (F) = 2, the condition χ(OF) = 0 forces the Kodaira dimension of F to be strictly smaller than two. By the easy addition formula for the Kodaira dimension one obtains an improvement of [\cite=Ca], Theorem 1.

Let X be a projective 3-fold of general type and maximal Albanese dimension. If q(X)  ≥  4, then the canonical linear system of X is not composite with a pencil. In particular, if pg(X) = 2 then q(X) = 3.

Let X be a projective manifold of maximal Albanese dimension. If pg(X) = 2, then q(X)  ≤   dim (X) + 1.

Let f:X  →  C be the canonical fibration. If q(X) >  dim (X) + 1, Theorem [\ref=thm1] implies that pg(X) = g(C) = q(X) -  dim (X) + 1  ≥  3.

The arguments used to prove Lemma [\ref=g2] can also be applied to bicanonical maps.

Let X be a projective manifold of maximal Albanese dimension, with κ(X)  ≥  2 and q(X) >  dim (X). Then the bicanonical linear system is not composite with a pencil.

Suppose that Φ2X is composite with a pencil, and let h:X  →  B be the fibration obtained as the Stein factorization of Φ2X. A general fiber F of h has maximal Albanese dimension, and by the weak addition theorem κ(F)  ≥  1, in particular F is not an Abelian variety. By [\cite=CH1], Theorem 3.2, one finds p2(F)  ≥  2.

As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=g2], there is an invertible subsheaf [formula], splitting locally and with h0(L) = p2(X). The locally free quotient sheaf [formula] is locally free of rank p2(F) - 1 and

[formula]

By [\cite=V] the sheaf [formula] is nef, hence

[formula]

The Riemann-Roch Theorem implies

[formula]

and hence g(B)  ≤  1.

By [\ref=prop] and [\ref=trace] one has pg(X)  ≥  2. The canonical map ΦX is defined by a linear subsystem of |K2X|, hence it factors through Φ2X, and the canonical fibration f:X  →  C factors through h. Since the fibres of f and h are both connected of the same dimension, C = B is a curve of genus ≤  1, contradicting Theorem [\ref=thm1].

The case [formula]

Let X and B be projective manifolds. Assume that the canonical fibration is a pencil f:X  →  C, and let h:X  →  B be a morphism, such that α = (f,h):X  →  C  ×  B is surjective. Then there is an injection

[formula]

Let us write α = (f,h):X  →  C  ×  B. Since ΦX factors through f, we may choose again an invertible subsheaf L of f*ωX = pr1 *α*ωX with pg(X) = h0(L). Then pr*1L is a subsheaf of α*ωX and one finds

[formula]

Let X be a projective manifold, whose canonical linear system is composite with a pencil, and let h:X  →  B be a fiber space over a curve B with g(B)  ≥  3. Then h factors through the canonical fibration f:X  →  C.

If not, the induced map α = (f,h):X  →  C  ×  B is surjective and [\ref=prod] implies that [formula]. Using again the nefness of h*ωX / B, the Riemann-Roch theorem implies that for g(B)  ≥  3 a contradiction.

By Theorem [\ref=thm1], we can assume that [formula]. Consider

[formula]

where u is the Ueno map. Then B is a curve of genus

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=nonex] h factors through the canonical fibration f:X  →  C. Then the image of a general fibre F of f under [formula] is an Abelian variety of dimension a(X) - 1, hence g(C)  ≤  q(X) - a(X)  +  1, and C = B. By Lemma [\ref=g2], one has pg(F) = 1. Since f*ωX / C is invertible and nef, the Riemann-Roch theorem implies that

[formula]

There is a series of examples, showing that there are no further restrictions on the numerical invariants in [\ref=thm2].

Let T be a surface of general type with pg(T) = q(T) = 0 and [formula]. Let S  →  T be the universal cover. Consider in addition a curve [formula] with an involution τ such that the genus of C =   /  τ is ≥  3, and let R be the ramification divisor of [formula] over C. Then

[formula]

is of general type with [formula], q(X) = g(C), and

[formula]

is induced by the second projection.

As we will see in Section [\ref=gt], for dim (X) = 3 and q(X) = 4 the condition on the Kodaira dimension of [formula] in Theorem [\ref=thm2] is needed. Nevertheless one can show without this assumption:

Let X be a projective 3-fold of general type, whose canonical fibration f:X  →  C is a pencil, and let F be a general fiber of f. If q(X)  ≥  4 and [formula], then pg(F) = 1, and f is the composite of [formula] and the Ueno map [formula].

By Theorems [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=thm2], we may assume that a desingularization S of [formula] is a surface of general type. By Lemma [\ref=g2], it only remains to exclude the case g(C) = pg(X) = pg(F) = 2.

By the universal property of the Albanese map, there exists a morphism h:S  →  C. Since [formula], the fibres of h are connected.

For a general point p∈C, consider the fibres F = f*(p), and H = h*(p). Since X and S are of general type, the easy addition formula implies that F and H are of general type. So

[formula]

and q(F) = g(H) = 2. Then

[formula]

This implies that S≃C  ×  H. Let α:X  →  H be the composite of [formula] with the projection S  →  H.

The sheaf E  =  α*ωX / H is nef. Assume that for p∈H in general position

[formula]

Then α- 1(p) belongs to the moving part of the linear system |KX|, hence it must be a fibre of f, contradicting the construction of α.

Using the Riemann-Roch theorem one finds and both, deg (E) and [formula] are zero. The long exact cohomology sequence for

[formula]

implies that [formula], hence pg(α- 1(p)) = 2, and ΦX|α- 1(p) is the canonical map of α- 1(p). Then the image of the canonical fibration of α- 1(p) is a curve of genus ≥  2, contradicting [\cite=X1].

[formula] is of general type

As mentioned in the Introduction, Theorem [\ref=thm2] does not hold true, without the assumption [formula].

For [formula] and

[formula]

we will construct projective n-folds X with irregularity q(X) = q and with [formula], whose canonical linear system is composite with a rational pencil with connected fibres. To this aim, consider an étale double cover   →  Y =   /  σ, satisfying the following condition:

Y is a manifold of general type, of maximal Albanese dimension, and with pg() = pg(Y) + 1.

Let C be a smooth curve of genus g  ≥  2 with hyperelliptic involution τ. Choose

[formula]

and [formula] to be the fibration induced by the second projection. Then X is of general type with

[formula]

and with [formula]. The product of the canonical fibration and the Albanese map factors like

[formula]

hence it is surjective.

To show that there exist examples of   →  Y satisfying the condition (*  ) and with q(Y) = q we start with:

dim (Y) = 1: Consider an étale cover   →  Y of a curve Y of genus 2, hence pg(Y) = 2, pg() = 3, and q(Y) = 2.

dim (Y) = 2: Let B be a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3, let [formula] be the Theta divisor, and let [formula] be the double cover defined by a non-zero 2-torsion element of [formula]. Then the inverse image   ⊂  A of Y under α is an étale double cover of Y, with pg(Y) = 3, pg() = 4 and q(Y) = 3.

Assume that i  →  Yi (i = 1, 2) satisfies (*  ), and let σi be the corresponding involution. Then

[formula]

is an étale double cover with pg() = pg(Y1)pg(Y2) + 1 and q() = q(Y1) + q(Y2), hence it also satisfies (*  ).

Now given n  ≥  3 taking for Y n - 1 copies of (i) we obtain examples with q(X) = 2n - 2. If n is odd, we may choose [formula] copies of (ii) and we find X with [formula]. For n even, one reaches [formula]. Of course, one can also find examples for all intermediate values.

Remark that part b) is a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm1] and that c) and d) are special cases of Theorem [\ref=thm2]. Moreover, if the canonical fibration f:X  →  C is an irrational pencil, the Albanese map factors through f.

Hence it only remains to consider the case

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the Stein factorization of [formula]. Blowing up X, if necessary, we will assume that S is non-singular. Remark that q(S) = q(X).

We will show step by step, that the surjectivity of

[formula]

implies:

The evaluation map [formula] is injective; in particular, [formula].

h0(Ω2X) = pg(S).

hi(h*ωX) = 0 for i > 0.

χ(OS) = 0.

Of course, (iv) contradicts the assumption that [formula], hence S, is a surface of general type.

(i) follows from Lemma [\ref=prod].

For (ii), replacing S and X by suitable smooth birational models, we will assume that for some simple normal crossing divisor B on S the morphism h is smooth over [formula], and that Δ = (h*B)red is a divisor with simple normal crossings. We have morphisms of sheaves where ε is the composite [formula]. Taking wedge product, one finds a complex of sheaves

[formula]

Note that h*(OX(h*B - Δ)) = OS, and that [formula].

Now suppose that h0(Ω2X) > pg(S), choose [formula], and let

[formula]

be the induced non-trivial map. Tensoring ([\ref=1]) with h*Ω1S, one obtains

[formula]

and, taking the direct image, one has a non-trivial map

[formula]

Let [formula] Clearly

[formula]

Since [formula], (i) implies that [formula] and dim (K)  ≥  q(S) - 2.

For a general point x∈X define

[formula]

Clearly [formula], and by the choice of φ,

[formula]

This implies that h*K generates an invertible subsheaf of h*Ω1S, hence a morphism S  →  D to a curve D of genus [formula], contradicting [\ref=nonex].

The Leray spectral sequence and the Serre duality for h imply that

[formula]

Hence (iii) follows from q(X) = q(S) and from (ii).

For (iv) remark first that (iii) together with semicontinuity, imply that for some open neighborhood [formula] of OS, and all P∈U one has

[formula]

It follows that for P∈U,

[formula]

Let Q be the cokernel of the injection [formula] constructed in (i). For P∈U one finds an exact sequence

[formula]

an isomorphism

[formula]

and [formula]. For P  =  OS, one finds whereas for P  ≠  OS, Since [formula], one obtains for the Euler characteristic

[formula]

Therefore, q(S) = pg(S) + 1, and hence χ(OS) = 0.

The case a(X) = q(X) =  dim (X)

Let X be a projective manifold whose canonical system is composite with a pencil, and let f:X  →  C be the canonical fibration. If the Albanese map [formula] is surjective, then either [formula], or g(C) = 1 and q(X) <  dim (X).

Clearly [formula]. If C is an elliptic curve, consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

where h is induced by the universal property of Albanese map. If q(X) =  dim (X), Proposition [\ref=trace] implies that [formula] for some torsion-free sheaf F on A. Let [formula] be the subsheaf generated by the global sections of f*ωX. Since pg(X) > pg(A) = 1, one finds that h0(F) > 0, hence [formula], contradicting the assumption that ΦX factors through f.

Let X be a projective manifold, with q(X) =  dim (X) and of maximal Albanese dimension. Assume the canonical system is composite with a pencil, and let f:X  →  C be the canonical fibration. Then [formula].

Let us end by giving some examples of manifolds X of maximal Albanese dimension with q(X) =  dim (X), and pg(X) arbitrarily large, whose canonical map is composite with a rational pencil.

Let (A,Θ) be a principally polarized Abelian n-fold ([formula]), and D∈|2Θ| a smooth divisor. The double cover obtained by taking the root out of D is of general type with pg(X) = 2.

For n  ≥  2 let (A,Θ) be a simple polarized Abelian n-fold of type [formula]. Let σ:X'  →  A be a blowing up, such that the moving part of |σ*Θ| defines a morphism f':X'  →  C', necessarily with [formula]. The general fibre F' of f' is of general type and pg(F') = h0(ωΘ) = n + 1. Since pg(X') = 1, one may write

[formula]

with [formula]. Since [formula] is nef by [\cite=Fu], an  ≥   - 2. On the other hand, σ*(ωX'(F')) is a subsheaf of OA(Θ), hence h0(ωX'(F'))  ≤  2. One finds in ([\ref=2]) [formula].

Let [formula] be a finite morphism of degree d > 1, ramified only over points p with f'- 1(p) smooth, and let f:X  →  C be the pull-back family.

Base change and ([\ref=2]) imply that

[formula]

hence that [formula] Then pg(X) = 2d - 1, the canonical map ΦX factors through f, and ωX contains [formula]. The latter induces an inclusion ωX / C  →  ω2X, and since the general fiber of f is of general type, X must be of general type.

By construction X is of maximal Albanese dimension, and Theorem [\ref=thm1] implies that dim (X) = q(X) = q(X'). This of course follows by base change for f'*OX' and R1f'*OX', as well.
