The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [\cite=susy] contains more than 100 free parameters [\cite=dimopoulos1]. Most of them belong to the supersymmetry breaking (SSB) sector. The problem is not only this huge number, but also the fact that these parameters have to be highly fine tuned so that they do not cause problems with experimental observations on the flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) processes and CP-violation phenomena [\cite=fcnc-mueg]-[\cite=fcnc]. This problem, called the SUSY flavor problem, is not new, but has existed ever, since supersymmetry found phenomenological applications. There are several approaches to overcome this problem [\cite=gauge]-[\cite=babu1].

The possibility of introducing more than 100 independent parameters into the MSSM is closely related to the fact that the degrees of freedom inherent in the Yukawa sector of the standard model (SM) are much more than the observable degrees of freedom. Since an exact flavor symmetry in the Yukawa sector can reduce this redundancy of the SM, the same symmetry can reduce that huge number of the independent parameters of the MSSM, and could suppress the dangerous FCNC processes and CP violating phases. Recently, it has been found [\cite=kubo] that a nonabelian, discrete flavor symmetry based on the permutation group S3 is consistent with the present experimental knowledge. That is, it is spontaneously broken, only because the electroweak gauge symmetry SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y is spontaneously broken . The idea to use nonabelian discrete symmetries to soften the SUSY flavor problem has been in fact proposed in [\cite=hall] [\cite=hamaguchi]. However, the symmetries considered in [\cite=hall] [\cite=hamaguchi] are explicitly broken at the supersymmetry breaking scale. Therefore, there is no convincing reason why they should be intact in the SSB sector. In this letter we will demonstrate that the exact flavor symmetry of [\cite=kubo], S3 in the hadronic sector and S3  ×  Z2 in the leptonic sector, can considerably soften the SUSY flavor problem.

Let us begin by supersymmetrizing the S3 invariant SM. The three generations of quark and lepton chiral superfields in MSSM are assumed to belong in a reducible representation of S3 equivalent to . We also introduce the S3-doublet Higgs pair, HUI,HDI(I = 1,2), as well as the S3-singlet Higgs pair, HU3,HD3. The same R-parity is assigned to these fields as in MSSM. Then we assume that the superpotential in MSSM, W  =  WD  +  WU  +  WE  +  Wν, is invariant under the S3-symmetry. The each part is given explicitly as follows (the neutrino superpotential is abbreviated for the present purpose);

[formula]

where

[formula]

We will discuss the Higgs part of the superpotential later on. It will be shown that Higgs VEV's can satisfy 〈H1〉  =  〈H2〉, which we shall assume throughout this letter. Consequently, the quark and lepton mass matrices take the general form

[formula]

where a = u,d,e. It has been found in [\cite=kubo] that the exact S3 flavor symmetry (along with an additional exact Z2 in the leptonic sector) is consistent with all the observed quark and lepton masses and mixing angles. Since this result can remain valid after supersymmetrization of the model, we would like to focus on the flavor structure in the superpartner sector, assuming the same flavor symmetry in the SSB sector.

Now we come to discuss the SUSY flavor problem in the slepton sector. The Z2-parity assignment is the same as in [\cite=kubo]:

[formula]

Note that me1 = me3  =  0 due to this discrete symmetry. Therefore, the lepton mass matrix can be written as

[formula]

where x  =  me5 / me2  =  16.78 and y  =  me4 / me2  =  0.006836 [\cite=kubo].

In order to evaluate the amount of the flavor changing processes generated in this model, we need to know the unitary matrices UeL and UeR to the mass eigenstates, which satisfy

[formula]

It is noticed that x≃mτ / mμ and [formula]. Since y and 1 / x are small numbers, let us evaluate the rotation matrices by expanding them with respect to these parameters. Here we evaluate the matrices at O(y2 / x2). Then the rotation matrices are found to be

[formula]

The MNS matrix [formula] is also found by using the rotation matrix of the neutrino sector Uν given in ref. [\cite=kubo]. Note that the maximal mixing appearing in the left handed rotation matrix is responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mixing. While the solar neutrino mixing is explained by the large mixing in the rotation matrix of the neutrino mass matrix. That is, the elements, (UeL)21 and (UeL)23 become, respectively, the (1,3) and (3,3) elements of the mixing matrix VMNS;

[formula]

The S3 symmetry restricts also the soft scalar mass matrices so that the off-diagonal elements are forbidden by the symmetry and two of three are completely degenerate. Explicitly the matrices are given in the form of

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the average of the slepton masses and (aL(R),bL(R)) are free parameters.

The branching ratio of a LFV event, e.g. Br(μ  →  e  +  γ), is proportional to the off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix with respect to the lepton mass eigenstates, which is given by [formula]. By using the expression given is by eq. ([\ref=UeL]), this matrix may be evaluated as

[formula]

where ΔL  =  bL  -  aL. It is convenient to see the ratio of the off-diagonal term to average of the diagonal terms, [formula], whose upper bounds from experimental results are given in the literatures [\cite=fcnc]. The explicit numbers of [formula]'s in this model are predicted as follows;

[formula]

The upper bounds for ratios of the off-diagonal elements (δij)LL(RR) [\cite=fcnc] are shown in Table 1. It is seen that all the off-diagonal elements are small enough to satisfy the LFV constraints. It is noted that the (1,2)- and (1,3)-elements are suppressed due to the small mixing. On the other hand the slepton mass matrix for the S3-doublets, which are roughly regarded as smu and stau, is proportional to the identity matrix. Therefore the (2,3)-element is almost vanishing, although the mixing angle of these bases is maximum.

Similarly, for the right-handed slepton the off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix may be evaluated by using UeR given by eq. ([\ref=UeR]) and found to be

[formula]

where ΔR  =  bR  -  aR The explicit ratios of the off-diagonal elements to the diagonal elements are found to be

[formula]

Thus the flavor mixing in the right-handed sector is also very small.

It is also necessary for the mass matrix between the left-handed and the right-handed sleptons, which is generated through the so-called A-terms, to satisfy the FCNC constraints. Since the Yukawa interactions in the superpotential must be invariant under the S3-symmetry, the left-right mass matrix may be parametrized as

[formula]

where Ai are free parameters. Here, however, we also assume them to be on the order of the gaugino masses. After rotating to the bases of lepton mass eigenstates, the mass matrix is found to be

[formula]

The ratio of the off-diagonal term to the average slepton mass [formula] are explicitly given by

[formula]

where Ãi denotes Ai() / 100. These results should be compared with the limits for [formula] shown in Table 1. It is seen that [formula] saturates nearly the experimental bound from μ  →  e ~ γ process, unless A2 - A4 is somewhat suppressed with some reason. The other off-diagonal elements are sufficiently smaller than the experimental bounds. Indeed alignment of the A-terms to the Yukawa couplings is fairly good in this model. The origin of this remarkable feature is that the structure of A-terms are also restricted by the S3-symmetry.

The additional discrete symmetry Z2 (which turns out be is anomaly-free) forbids CP-violations in the leptonic as well as in the hadronic sector. Consequently, Z2 should be explicitly broken in the hadronic sector to accommodate CP violations. Therefore, the mass matrices for the up (down) sector quarks are parametrized as given by eq. ([\ref=general-m]). As in the leptonic case, we introduce the unitary matrices Uu(d)L and Uu(d)R satisfying

[formula]

In [\cite=kubo], it has been found that the hierarchical quark masses in the up and down sectors,

[formula]

as well as the parameters in the CKM matrix may be obtained by choosing the parameters in the mass matrices as follows;

[formula]

It should be noted that there are 10 real parameters and one phase in mass matrices to fine tune to produce six quark masses, three mixing angles and one CP-violating phase. Therefore the unitary matrices may be determined without ambiguity in this tuning process. The explicit unitary matrices are found to be

[formula]

Note that the off-diagonal elements in UdL and UdR carry large complex phases.

The S3-symmetry restricts also the squark mass matrices to the same forms as given by eq. ([\ref=scalarmass]). These matrices should be rotated to bases of the quark mass eigenstates by using the unitary matrices given by eqs. ([\ref=UuL]-[\ref=UdR]). As for the down-type squark mass matrix, the ratios of the off-diagonal elements to the average of squark mass squared turn out to be as follows;

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ΔL(R)  =  bL(R)  -  aL(R). The upper bounds for the parameters from measurements of K - q, D - , Bd  -  d mixing, εK, b  →  s ~ γ and ε' / ε [\cite=fcnc] are shown in Table 2. The imaginary parts are constrained by CP-violating processes. Interestingly enough these mixings satisfy the experimental bounds not only for the FCNC but also for CP-violation. Also the off diagonal elements of the up-type squark mass matrix are found to be on the same order of those for the down-type squarks. Therefore mixing in the up-type squark sector is sufficiently smaller than the experimental bounds.

Mixing between the left-handed and the right-handed squarks and also their effects to FCNC and CP-violation may be evaluated just as done for the slepton sector. Again it is crucial that the A-terms are constrained by the S3-symmetry. The left-right mass matrix is parametrized as

[formula]

with assuming Ai are on the same order of the gaugino mass. Now the off-diagonal elements on the bases of quark mass eigenstates may be explicitly obtained, since the rotation matrices UuL(R) and UdL(R) are fixed. Their ratio to the average squark masses, whose experimental constraints are shown also in Table 2, are found to be

[formula]

where the A-parameters Ai are assumed to be O(500). It is seen that alignment of the LR-mass matrix to the Yukawa matrix is remarkably good. This is because (1,2)-elements of the matrix [formula], or [formula], are almost of the democratic type and mixing with the 3rd elements are tiny. Thus it has been found that the FCNC as well as CP constraints for supersymmetric extension of the standard model are resolved solely by the exact flavor symmetry of S3.

One of the important features of this model is to have a pair of S3-doublet Higgs fields HU(D)I(I = 1,2) as well as a pair of S3-singlet Higgs HU(D)3. Also all the Higgs fields must acquire non-vanishing VEV. Moreover 〈HU(D)1〉  =  〈HU(D)2〉 should be satisfied, which has been assumed so far. On the other hand the S3-invariant supersymmetric mass terms for these Higgs fields may be given by

[formula]

as extension of the so-called μ-term in the MSSM. Then, however, it is found that the global symmetry of the tree-level Higgs potential is enhanced to the complex extension of U(2). Consequently, there appear extra massless goldstone particles and this naive extension cannot be accepted phenomenologically. Note, however, that the whole theory does not have this enhanced symmetry and their masses are not protected from radiative corrections in the presence of soft supersymmetry breaking terms. Therefore, the dangerous light Higgs particles are not exactly massless (pseudo-goldstones), although they will be still much lighter than the lightest Higgs in the MSSM.

Thus it is necessary to extend the Higgs sector so that the tree level potential does not have continuous symmetries enhanced from S3. For this purpose let us introduce SM-gauge singlets NI(I = 1,2) and N3 belonging to of S3, where we assume that N's have even parity of Z2. (S3-doublet (singlet) Higgs fields have been assigned to be odd (even)under the Z2-parity.) Then we consider the S3-invariant superpotential

[formula]

where the matrices κ and η are given by ([\ref=kappa]). The superpotential ([\ref=SMsinglet]) has no enhanced continuos symmetry. Observe that the superpotential ([\ref=SMsinglet]) is also invariant under

[formula]

Furthermore, the D terms and also the relevant soft supersymmetry breaking terms have the same discrete symmetry. This implies that 〈H1〉  =  〈H2〉 ~ , ~ 〈N2〉 = 0 correspond to a stationary point of the scalar potential . We, therefore, can expect that the desired properties (avoiding the pseudo Goldstones and 〈H1〉  =  〈H2〉) can be satisfied in a wide range of the parameter space. The masses of the Higgs multiplets depend on the parameters in the scalar potential, and the presence of multiple Higgs particles give rise to FCNCs and CP-violations at the tree-level. In multi-Higgs models, the tree-level FCNCs and CP-violations may cause problems in general. However, various dangerous processes in the nonsupersymmetric case have been considered in [\cite=kubo], and it has been found that these processes satisfy the severe experimental upper bounds. So we may assume that the situation does not change by supersymmetrization. A complete analysis on this problem will go beyond the scope of the present paper, and we would like to leave it for future problems.

The idea to use nonabelian discrete symmetries to soften the SUSY flavor problem is not new [\cite=hall] [\cite=hamaguchi]. The only problem is that the symmetries considered in [\cite=hall] [\cite=hamaguchi] are explicitly broken at the supersymmetry breaking scale. Therefore, there is no convincing reason why they should be intact in the SSB sector. The flavor symmetry recently found in [\cite=kubo] seems to be exact so far: It is spontaneously broken, only because the electroweak gauge symmetry SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y is spontaneously broken. It is therefore the most natural to assume that the flavor symmetry is intact in the SSB sector, too. We indeed found in this letter that the flavor symmetry of [\cite=kubo] can soften considerably the SUSY flavor problem.
