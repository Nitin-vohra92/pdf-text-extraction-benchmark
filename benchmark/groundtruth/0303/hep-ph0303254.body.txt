A new implication for strong interactions if large, direct CP violation in [formula] is confirmed

Two experiments have very recently published results concerning CP violation in the decays [formula] [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref2] [\cite=ref3]. The results involve measurements of the two parameters which determine mixing-induced and direct CP-violation. Direct CP-violation would occur even if the sizable mixing[\cite=ref4] between B0 and [formula] caused by the known [\cite=ref4] mass difference Δmd between the states [formula], were to vanish (i. e. Δmd  →  0). When one recalls that more than 25 years passed after the discovery of CP violation[\cite=ref5], before direct CP violation in the [formula] system was established by different experiments [\cite=ref6] [\cite=ref7] [\cite=ref8], it is clear that the significance of the present single experimental indication [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref3] for large, direct CP violation in the [formula] system warrants careful consideration. The two general empirical parameters mentioned above are, of course, related through the parameters of the standard model and certain dynamical assumptions[\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref2]. However in the decay mode in which CP violation in the [formula] system was discovered [\cite=ref9] [\cite=ref10], that due to mixing is large [\cite=ref9] [\cite=ref10], whereas direct CP violation is not detected [\cite=ref9]. It is a general requirement [\cite=ref11] [\cite=ref12] that significant elastic and/or inelasticity-induced, strong-interaction phases (at least two different phases) be present, in order for direct CP violation to be manifest in the decay amplitudes for particle and antiparticle. In this paper we demonstrate within an explicit and clear dynamical model involving physical hadrons, that if the large, direct CP violation recently reported [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref3] is confirmed, then a most unusual situation must hold for the two necessary strong-interaction phases. This is our main purpose. The model can accommodate, in principle, the necessary generation of a large difference between two strong-interaction phases of about [formula]. It provides a natural enhancement for the phase difference.

The time evolution of the decays [formula] is described [\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref2] by

[formula]

where the upper (lower) sign refers to [formula] decay (with a [formula] tagged). The phenomenological parameters[\cite=ref13] Sππ and Cππ, for mixing-induced and direct CP violation respectively, are defined by

[formula]

with [formula]. The states (heavy (H) and light (L)) with mass difference Δmd [\cite=ref13] are

[formula]

Here [formula] and Bππ denote the complex decay amplitudes for [formula], respectively. In the model developed below, these amplitudes depend upon two strong-interaction phases, and upon a CP-violating weak-interaction phase; an explicit dependence is exhibited in Eqs. (7,8) below. The BELLE[\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref3] and BABAR[\cite=ref2] results are:

[formula]

As we shall see below, a remarkable feature of the BELLE data is the large magnitude of Cππ( - Aππ), the parameter which describes direct CP violation (i. e. is present for Δmd  →  0).

We begin the analysis with the determination of two strong-interaction eigenstates which mix the final π+π- system (the component with isospin zero) at a total (c. m. ) energy of [formula], with another two-particle system of distinctly different particle content, namely ηηc.[\cite=ref12] This particular system is mixed by quasi-elastic strong interaction [\cite=ref11] [\cite=ref12] with ππ.F5 The reaction is quasi-elastic at a c. m. energy of 5.28 GeV, the momentum in the ηηc system is 0.7 times that in the ππ system. The [formula] component which is implicit in the constitution of the systemF5 ηηc, brings the complex phase δ ( or δ13)[\cite=ref14] of the CKM matrix (necessary for CP violation in the standard-model weak interaction) directly into play in the decay amplitudes [formula] and Bππ (Eq. (6) below). Consider a two-by-two strong-interaction K matrix for quasi-elastic scattering of the form

[formula]

The momenta in the two systems are respectively, [formula]. The single dimensionless parameter e controls the strength of the effective "scattering length", [formula], which is taken as > 0. A priori, a parameter like e is of order unity.[\cite=ref12] We shall allow e to be "enhanced", in order to see what is necessary to represent the BELLE data. We do not consider an effective "scattering length" larger than a few times (1 / mB0), that is [formula], corresponding to a maximal strong-interaction phase of about 60[formula] in magnitude. Unitarity is respected by using 1 / (1 + iK) in the decay amplitudes[\cite=ref12], leading to the Watson strong-interaction phase factors eiΔ1,2 for the eigenstates. The eigenstates of K are simply [formula] with eigenvalue phase Δ1 given by [formula], and [formula] with eigenvalue phase Δ2 given by [formula]. Note that there are the two essential strong-interaction phases, and that these are opposite in sign. This feature leads to an immediate doubling of the magnitude of the phase difference (Δ2  -  Δ1), and the direct CP-violating asymmetry parameter Cππ is proportional to sin (Δ2  -  Δ1). This doubling is an important effect obtained in this model, also because it can take individual phases in the fourth and first quadrants into a phase difference in the third quadrant, with the resulting negative sign for the cosine and sine of the phase difference. It is the negative cosine which gives rise to an enhancement of the magnitude of Cππ, in Eq. (10) below. The state [formula]; the explicit dependence on the strong-interaction phases in the decay amplitudes can be exhibited as

[formula]

The two complex amplitudes A1,2 involve the weak interactions; explicitly the KM phase δ from the quark mixing matrix. Within this model with eigenstates [formula], we are led to an ansatz for the explicit forms A1,2,

[formula]

with [formula]. Here [formula] represents a "fraction" for a [formula] component in the system ηηc; we use [formula] in numerical estimates. The ratio of the sines of small mixing angles (s2 / s3)  =  s̃ > 1 (we use s̃  ~  2.5 in numerical estimates[\cite=ref14]), appears as the result of the relative values of different elements of the CKM matrix (in its original form[\cite=ref15], or as (s12s23 / s13) in the "standard" form[\cite=ref14]). The relevant elements involve that for b  →  c times that leading to [formula], relative to that for b  →  u times that leading to [formula]. (We approximate the cosines of the small CKM angles as ~  1.) Thus, the amplitudes A1,2 involve two different CP-violating phases δ1,2, as functions of δ.

[formula]

The phase difference (δ2  -  δ1) is not zero unless δ  →  0 (i. e. δ1  =  δ2 = 0). Using Eqs. (6,7) we have, in the model

[formula]

Then

[formula]

using[\cite=ref13] [\cite=ref14] (q / p) = e- i2β, [formula]. We thus obtain explicit formulae for the Cππ and Sππ in Eq. (2a), using the model; we use[\cite=ref14] δ  ~  45o in numerical estimates.

[formula]

with [formula]; [formula];

[formula] and thus [formula]; Δ21 = (Δ2  -  Δ1).

Clearly, as δ  →  0 we have δ1,2  →  0 and |λ|  →  1; then Cππ  →  0 and Sππ  →    -   sin 2β  ~   - 0.7, as measured in [\cite=ref9] [\cite=ref10]. As stated after Eq. (3), the BELLE value for Aππ  =   - Cππ is large; in the context of the above formula this requires a very large Δ21 to obtain an enhancement factor from the denominator. We consider [formula]. As stated following Eq. (4), this is nearly the largest phase difference that we can consider within the framework of this model. Then from Eqs. (10), we calculate

[formula]

Such a large difference between two strong-interaction phases is a surprising new result. From our discussion following Eq. (4),

[formula]

and thus there is an effective "scattering length" of

[formula]

This dynamical model thus allows, in principle, for such a strong quasi-elastic interaction. However, in the context of two-body interactions of physical hadrons at 5.28 GeV c. m. energy, the A in Eq. (13) appears rather large. For example, taking[\cite=ref12] e  ~  1 gives only a small [formula]. Then, Δ21  =  (Δ2  -  Δ1)  ~   - 2ω  ~   - 0.09, which results in a much smaller parameter for direct CP violation

[formula]

If there is a large Cππ, a measurable prediction for the decay mode [formula] is that [formula], where b.r. denotes multiplication of C by the corresponding branching ratio. Also, from only the quasi-elastic strong-interactions which we have discussed here, the parameter for direct CP violation in [formula] is [formula].

The main result of this paper is the sizable value calculated for Aππ =  - Cππ. In connection with the present experimental results [\cite=ref2] [\cite=ref3] for Sππ, we note that there is a different simple possibility for the Sππ calculated within the framework of Eqs. (10) obtained from this dynamical model. This involves the possibility within the model of δ1,2  →  δ2,1 with N1,2  →  N2,1, and Δ1,2  →  Δ2,1. This illustrates the role of the first term for Sππ in Eq. (11) which then gives rise to a somewhat smaller - Sππ. Cππ is unchanged. This suggests that it is not natural to have a sizable Cππ together with a very small Sππ. On the other hand, if final-state interactions are completely neglegible, Cππ  →  0; then we have Sππ  →   sin (2β + 2δ), which could be ~  0 if (2β + 2δ) is [formula].

In summary, we have shown that the large, direct CP-violating parameter |Cππ| reported[\cite=ref1] [\cite=ref3] by the BELLE collaboration implies the presence of a very large difference between (at least) two strong-interaction phases. We have shown how strong, two-body quasi-elastic interactions between physical hadrons at mB0 = 5.28 GeV, can accommodate such an unusual strong-interaction phase difference.F8 This type of model might allow new possibilities for estimating the strong-interaction phases which are necessary for observable direct CP violation, in other two-body final states from [formula] decay.

Added note

The BABAR collaboration has just reported the observation of the decays B∓  →  π∓η, and an interesting negative, direct CP-violating asymmetry (in hep-ex/0303039). In [\cite=ref12], minimal estimates of the strong-interaction phases are used in estimating the CP-violating asymmetries. Values of the K-matrix elements for the final-state strong interactions are taken, which are minimal in magnitude. These are likely to be larger, by a factor of at least 2. The calculated asymmetries are multiplied by this factor. S. B. thanks Janice Button-Schafer for helpful communications about the new BABAR results.
