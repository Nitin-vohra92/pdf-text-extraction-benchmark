Rotation of Hot Horizontal Branch Stars in Galactic Globular Clusters.

We determined the radial velocity (vrad) and the projected rotational velocity (vsini) for each of our program stars using the cross-correlation technique described by Tonry & Davis (1979). Figure 1 shows the complete set of projected rotational velocity data for M79, NGC2808, M80 and M15, including Behr et a. (2000b, B00b) results for the last cluster. These results suggest a link between the photometric G99 jump and the discontinuity in the distribution of the HB stellar rotation rates. Radiative levitation of metals has been invoked by G99 to explain the jump. Besides, the metal abundance anomalies (enhancements of metals, underabundance of He) found by Behr et al (1999) and B00b constitute an empirical evidence that radiative levitation and diffusion are effectively at work in the envelope of HB stars with Teff  ≥  11,500K. As a consequence, R02 argue that the absence of fast rotators at Teff  ≥  11,500K might be due to an increase of angular momentum removal caused by enhanced mass loss in the more metallic atmospheres of the stars hotter than the jump (see also Vink and Cassisi, 2002). However, the real open problem is that we still lack of any plausible explanation for the presence of fast rotators (see discussion in R02).
