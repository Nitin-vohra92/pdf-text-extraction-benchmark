Introduction

3+1 formulations of general relativity (GR), commonly used in numerical integration, break Einstein's equations onto constraints that must be solved to obtain initial conditions on an initial space-like three-dimensional hypersurface, and a Cauchy part, an evolution problem that is then integrated forward in time [\cite=ADM] [\cite=3+1]. It is well known that integration in time is often unstable and terminates prematurely. In particular, this happens frequently in numerical calculations of black hole collisions which are expected to be a major source of gravitational radiation gravitational observatories [\cite=BH-collisions]. There is no complete understanding of the causes of instabilities. Gauge and constraints instabilities of Einstein's equations are definitely a part of the problem [\cite=INTRIN-INSTABILITIES]. Bad choice of a numerical scheme may be another. Einstein's equations are highly non-linear, and finding a numerical method capable of stable long-term integration of these equations remains an outstanding problem in numerical GR.

In [\cite=KHOKHLOV-03], we gave an example of an asymptotic non-linear instability which arises in a simple scalar hyperbolic equation, [formula], whose non-linear term mimics a quadratic non-linearity of much more complex Einstein's equations. This equation is well-posed and it does not suffer from gauge or constraint instabilities. Stable numerical schemes applied to this equation converge to exact solutions at any fixed time t when numerical resolution is increased. However, numerical integration can become asymptotically unstable if the resolution is kept fixed and t is increased, t  →    ∞  . The instability is caused by breaking down of a delicate balance between linear and non-linear terms in the discretized versions of the equation. An important point is that the breakdown takes place without violating second-order accuracy of a discretization. Therefore, having both convergence at finite t and an asymptotic instability at t  →    ∞   is not a contradiction.

We studied in [\cite=KHOKHLOV-03] an exponential transformation g = eφ, which maps 0  <  g  <    ∞   onto -    ∞    <  φ  <    ∞   and leads to a modified equation φtt  =  φxx  -  (α + 1)φ2x - (β - 1)φ2x  -  γφxφt, for a logarithmic variable φ. We demonstrated that using the modified equation instead of the original one dramatically improves the accuracy and long-term stability of numerical integration.

There is no reason to believe that asymptotic instability is limited to scalar equations and that it cannot occur in more complex systems such as equations of GR. We want to investigate whether discretized Einstein's equations are prone to such an instability, and if numerical integration of these equations can be improved and prolonged by an exponential transformation of variables. As a first step in this direction, we show that it is possible to formulate a tensorial exponential transformation for a three-dimensional metric γij of space-like hypersurfaces embedded in a four-dimensional space-time (Section 2). The transformation leads to a 3+1 formulation of Einstein's equations which describes the evolution of γij at every point of a hypersurface as streth and rotation of a local cartesian coordinate system in a tangential space (Section 3).

Exponential transformation of a three-dimensional metric

Metric in terms of stretch and rotation variables

To carry out a tensorial exponential transformation, we write a three-dimensional metric of a space-like hypersurface, dh2  =  γijdxidxj, as

[formula]

where Dij  =  δijλi is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of γij, and Aij is the orthogonal matrix of rotations, [formula]; superscript [formula] denotes a matrix transposition, [formula], and AmiAmj  =  δij. Decomposition [\eqref=gamma1] is always possible for a symmetric matrix.

Since the three-dimensional metric is positive definite, 0  <  λi  <    ∞  , we can introduce logarithms of eigenvalues φi  =   ln λi and write

[formula]

The transformation maps eigenvalues λi onto a ( -   ∞  ,  ∞  ) interval; dh2 = 0 corresponds to φk  →    -    ∞  .

Rotation matrix can be further expressed as exponentiation of an anti-symmetric matrix. We write

[formula]

where θk is a rotation vector dual to Mij, and εijk is a fully anti-symmetric symbol (matrices wkij  =  εijk, k = 1,2,3, are generators of a rotation group). Using new variables, we can rewrite [\eqref=gamma1] as

[formula]

Equation [\eqref=gamma1] or [\eqref=gamma1a] describes γij as a result of stretch and rotation of a cartesian coordinate system with a metric δij carried out in a tangential space at every point of a hypersurface. Transformation [\eqref=gamma1] is unique if all three eigenvalues of γij are different. If two or three eigenvalues are degenerate, then one of the angles of rotation or all three of them cannot be uniquely defined. However, quantities which have physical meaning, such as angular velocities and acceleration, remain meaningful. The evolution equations for φi and θi which we formulate below are unique (we address this in detail at the end of the paper). In what follows, we will refer to φi, θi, and their certain derivatives as exponential stretch rotation (ESR) variables. Our aim will be to rewrite Einstein's equations in terms of ESR variables.

Before proceeding any further, we must discuss index notation and summation rules used in the paper. These rules are different from these commonly used in GR because ESR variables and matrices Aij do not transform like vectors or tensors under curvilinear coordinate transformations, and it usually takes a combination of several ESR variables to form a covariant or a contravariant object. In index notations, we will not distinguish between upper and lower indices in ESR variables and their derivatives. For example, Aij will be a matrix with the same elements as Aij or Aij. Summation in formulas involving ESR variables is implicitly assumed over a repeating index. An index in a formula may repeat more than two times. However, there will be one (and only one) very important exception from this rule: summation must never be carried over a repeating index if the index is present only once on one side of an equation and more than once on the other side. Equation [\eqref=D] above is an example of the summation exception rule. The is no summation over i in this formula. Another example will be an equation aij  =  bilmcikldmijkl, where summation must be carried out over indices m, k, and l, but no summation is carried over i. However, in the equation aii  =  bilmcikldmiikl summation must be carried over m, k, l, and i on the right-hand side, and over i on the left-hand side. These modified rules let one to simplify and unambiguously perform manipulations with equations involving ESR variables, and to express tensorial objects in terms of ESR variables in a compact and unambiguous way.

In what follows, it will be convenient to use auxiliary variables

[formula]

Since εnikεnjm  =  δijδkm  -  δimδkj, we have

[formula]

Rodrigues formula then gives the rotation matrix Aij in terms of θk,

[formula]

Using [\eqref=Rodrig], we can write a closed expression for the metric [\eqref=gamma1] as

[formula]

Since

[formula]

formula [\eqref=gamma2] with φi  →    -  φi gives a closed expression for γij.

Differentials of the metric

We now must derive the formulas which relate first and second differentials of the metric, dγij and d2γij, with first and second differentials of ESR variables, dφi, dθi, d2φi, d2θi. Differentiation of [\eqref=gamma1] gives

[formula]

where we introduced three new matrices Bk which are first derivatives of a rotation matrix with respect to θk,

[formula]

In [\eqref=Bk] and throughout the paper, symbol ";" does not mean a covariant differentiation, but simply used to separate indices of different nature.

To invert [\eqref=dg1] and obtain dφk and dθk in terms of dγij, we must rotate [\eqref=dg1] into a coordinate system where γij is diagonal by multiplying [\eqref=dg1] with Aij and [formula]. The result is

[formula]

where

[formula]

From orthogonality of Aij it follows that combinations [formula] are anti-symmetric,

[formula]

Therefore, Ck;ij are symmetric trace-free matrices with all diagonal elements identically equal to zero,

[formula]

and because of this property dφk and dθk in [\eqref=dgrot] do not mix. We can use diagonal part of [\eqref=dgrot] to find

[formula]

Off-diagonal part of [\eqref=dgrot] gives a system of three linear equations

[formula]

which can be solved to find dθi,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and | ~ . ~ | is a module operation. Using matrices Ck;ij we can write

[formula]

To derive expressions for d2φi and d2θi we differentiate [\eqref=dgrot] and obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and we denoted second derivatives of a rotation matrix as

[formula]

Note, that H0ij;nmdφndφm make a non-zero contribution only to a diagonal part of [\eqref=d2grot], whereas H2ij;nmdφndθm contributes only to an off-diagonal part.

Diagonal part of [\eqref=d2grot] then gives us

[formula]

Off-diagonal part of [\eqref=d2grot] gives

[formula]

where Cij has been defined in [\eqref=C]. The above formulas, [\eqref=dphi],[\eqref=dteta],[\eqref=d2phi], and [\eqref=d2teta], relate first and second differentials of new variables φk and θk to first and second differentials of γij. There is a linear relation between dθk, dφk and dγij ([\eqref=dgrot]). Both d2φk and d2θk depend linearly on second differentials d2γij and in addition involve squares of first differentials dγij (see [\eqref=d2grot]).

Cristoffels and Ricci tensor

We use [\eqref=dg1] to write first derivatives of γij with respect to spatial coordinates as

[formula]

and Cristoffel symbols

[formula]

as

[formula]

From [\eqref=Cr] we get contracted Cristoffel symbols

[formula]

and their spatial derivatives

[formula]

Γi do not depend on partial derivatives of angular variables θi. Expressions for spatial derivatives of Cristoffel symbols are

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Three-dimensional Ricci tensor

[formula]

written in terms of new variables will contain second order quasi-linear terms proportional to [formula] and [formula] plus lower order non-linear terms made of products of first derivatives [formula] and [formula]. We can write it as

[formula]

Using formulas [\eqref=Gkik] - [\eqref=5G], coefficients in front of second-order terms can be written as

[formula]

and

[formula]

Low-order term coefficients (3,4,5)R can be trivially found from [\eqref=Gkik] - [\eqref=5G] as well.

Trace and trace-free part of the first differential

ESR representation of the metric γij leads to a natural decomposition of its first differential dγij onto trace and trace-free parts. Trace-free part depends only on dθi whereas trace part depends only on dφi.

We denote trace of a matrix in a tangential space as

[formula]

and trace of a tensor in curved space as

[formula]

From [\eqref=dg2] we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where superscripts t and tf denote trace- and trace-free parts of dγij, respectively. Analogously,

[formula]

so that in a curved space we have as well

[formula]

Einstein's equations in ESR form

Our starting point is a standard ADM 3+1 formulation which consists of an evolution part

[formula]

and constraints

[formula]

where

[formula]

and we defined

[formula]

Evolution part and constraints

To keep up with the first time - second space derivative form of [\eqref=ADM], we introduce additional ESR variables, rates of deformation ψk and angular velocities ωk,

[formula]

Our goal is to rewrite [\eqref=ADM] in terms of φk, θk, ψk and ωk.

Taking time derivative of the first equation in [\eqref=ADM] and combining it with the second equation, we get

[formula]

where we defined

[formula]

Next step is to rotate [\eqref=d2gdt2] into a coordinate system where γij is diagonal. Making use of [\eqref=d2grot] we obtain

[formula]

First term on the left-hand side of [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot] has non-zero elements only on the main diagonal whereas the second term has only off-diagonal non-zero elements. We will use this to obtain separate equations for ψi and ωi, but first we need to derive explicit expression for the right-hand side of [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot] in terms of new variables.

From the first equation in [\eqref=ADM], making use of [\eqref=dg1] we obtain

[formula]

so that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where

[formula]

From [\eqref=Krot] we see that first term on the right-hand side of [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot] is simply

[formula]

and [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot] thus can be rewritten as

[formula]

Using [\eqref=Krot] - [\eqref=Krot2], we obtain

[formula]

Rotation of Kij gives

[formula]

First term in [\eqref=T2] has only diagonal, second only off-diagonal, and the third has both diagonal and off-diagonal non-zero elements.

Consider first a diagonal part of [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot1]. Gathering diagonal contributions from the last four terms on the right-hand side of [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot1] we obtain a set of evolution equations for deformation rates ψi,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Gathering off-diagonal contributions in [\eqref=d2gdt2-rot1] we obtain

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Finally, solving equations [\eqref=offdiag] we obtain a set of equations for angular velocities ωi,

[formula]

Equations [\eqref=dpsidt], [\eqref=domegadt] together with two equations [\eqref=psiomega] constitute an evolution part of an ADM system transformed to ESR variables.

Rewriting constraint equations is straightforward but the resulting formulas are rather complicated and we do not present them here. To derive these formulas, one has to substitute expressions for the Riemann tensor [\eqref=Ri], extrinsic curvature [\eqref=Krot], [\eqref=Krot1], [\eqref=Krot2], and Cristoffel symbols [\eqref=Cr] into [\eqref=ADMC]. In rewriting the momentum constraints, one has also to differentiate Kij and K with respect to xk, which in turn requires differentiation of terms containing rotation matrices Aij and their first derivatives. Expressions of second-order derivatives of Aij are given in [\eqref=Ekr].

For the energy constraint, one can also obtain a simple formula expressing C0 through right-hand sides of the evolution equations for ψi. Summing up [\eqref=dpsidt] and using [\eqref=Krot2] we obtain

[formula]

First and second terms in brackets in [\eqref=dsumpsi] can be replaced using the expression [\eqref=ADMC] for the energy constraint,

[formula]

The latter equation can be inverted to obtain the energy constraint as

[formula]

We see that in ESR formulation the energy constraint depends linearly on time derivatives of ψi. Setting C0  =  0 in [\eqref=C0] will define a plane in the three-dimensional space of [formula] in which the evolution of a constrained solution must occur, regardless of a choice of gauge. The unit normal to the plane is a vector with components [formula]. A distance from the plane is given by the actual value of -  α2C0. Modifying [\eqref=dpsidt] by adding the term [formula] to each of the right-hand sides will project numerical evolution onto a local C0 = 0 plane, and may help with improving the accuracy of the evolution along a (generally curved) surface of constrained solutions.

We also note that differentiation of [\eqref=Krot2] gives

[formula]

so that we can rewrite [\eqref=dsumpsi], assuming C0 = 0, in a more familiar form as

[formula]

Case of degenerate eigenvalues

As was mentioned in the beginning of the paper, decomposition [\eqref=gamma1] is always possible but it is not unique if γij has degenerate eigenvalues. In case of two degenerate eigenvalues, rotation angle in the direction orthogonal to the corresponding eigenvectors is arbitrary. In case of three degenerate eigenvalues all three rotation angles are arbitrary. For example, a flat three-dimensional hypersurface with Cartesian coordinate system on it is a case of triply-degenerate eigenvalues. In all of these cases, the matrix Cij in [\eqref=C] becomes degenerate and cannot be inverted. Equation [\eqref=domegadt] then cannot be used to determine [formula]. Below we describe how [formula] should be determined when eigenvalues are degenerate.

Consider first the case of triple degeneracy, φ1  =  φ2  =  φ3. Using [\eqref=prop1] we can rewrite [\eqref=Ci] as

[formula]

We see that in a triply-degenerate case all three [formula], and [\eqref=offdiag] becomes a system of three algebraic equations

[formula]

with respect to ωi. We assume that conditions for lapse α and shift βi are given, and that φi, θi, ψi, and ωi are known on a three-dimensional hypersurface as a result of previous evolution. Thus, first, second, and last terms in [\eqref=offdiag3] are known, and Ω1ij;nm and Ω2ij;nm which depend on φi and θi are known as well. Then [\eqref=offdiag3] is a set of three quadratic equations for ωi which are automatically satisfied at a degenerate point by continuity of ωi. Differentiation of [\eqref=offdiag3] with respect to t will give us expressions for [formula] which will depend on φi, θi, ψi, ωi and on [formula]. The latter values are given by [\eqref=dpsidt]. Thus we can uniquely determine [formula] as functions of φi, θi, ψi, ωi, and their spatial derivatives, which was our original purpose.

The case of two degenerate eigenvalues can be treated similarly. Without loss of generality, assume that φ1  =  φ2. Then all elements of symmetric matrices Ck;ij are zero excluding Ck;13  =  Ck;31  ≠  0 and Ck;23  =  Ck;32  ≠  0. Equations [\eqref=offdiag] then reduce to one algebraic equation with respect to ωi,

[formula]

plus two partial differential equations

[formula]

[formula]

Differentiation of [\eqref=ADMNEW4-2] allows us to determine one time derivative say, [formula] as a function of other variables and two other derivatives, [formula], [formula]. Substitution of [formula] into [\eqref=ADMNEW4-3] and [\eqref=ADMNEW4-4] will then give us two equations to explicitly determine [formula], [formula]. Using them we can find [formula].

A similar approach should be used in case of degenerate eigenvalues to determine SRE variables and their derivatives from γij and its derivatives on the initial hypersurface. We see from the above consideration that starting from degenerate initial conditions with arbitrary rotation angles θi does not mean that rotation velocities ωi and accelerations [formula] can also be set arbitrary. Angular velocities must be determined from [\eqref=offdiag3], and they will depend among other things on lapse and shift conditions that we wish to use for the evolution.

Conclusions

In this paper we formulated a tensorial exponential transformation of a three-dimensional metric of space-like hypersurfaces embedded in a four-dimensional space time in terms of exponential stretch-rotation, or ESR variables (Section 2). We derived formulas relating derivatives of the metric with the corresponding derivatives of these variables. A 3+1 system of Einstein's equations, formulated in terms of ESR variables, describes time evolution of the metric at every point of a hypersurface as a continuous stretch and rotation of a local cartesian coordinate system in a tangential space (Section 3).

We want to mention that certain exponential transformation of variables were used in GR before for special symmetric cases. Such transformations sometime simplify analytical operations, and final results may sometime be formulated in a more compact form [\cite=EXP-BEFORE]. The transformation [\eqref=gamma1], [\eqref=gamma1a], [\eqref=gamma2] considered in this paper is the most general exponential transformation which can be carried out for a three-dimensional metric without assuming any symmetries.

A potential advantage of the ESR formulation is a change it introduces to the structure of right-hand sides of Einstein's equations by eliminating contravariant four-dimensional metric gab as a multiplicative term in these equations. For a scalar non-linear hyperbolic equation considered in [\cite=KHOKHLOV-03], the removal of a term g- 1, where g is a scalar equivalent of the metric, lead to a dramatic improvement in long-term stability of numerical integration. Consider right-hand sides of [\eqref=dpsidt] and [\eqref=domegadt]. Ricci tensor Rij and other terms written using ESR variables consist of parts that either do not have multipliers [formula] or have multipliers of the type [formula]. That is, they either do not have γij multipliers or have multiplier that are ratios of different eigenvalues of γij. In front of the right-hand sides There are multipliers of the type α2e-  φi in front of the right-hand sides. We must recall that the lapse is a g00 component of the four-dimensional metric gab and thus having this multiplier is equivalent of having ratios of the zero-th (negative) eigenvalue to other three (positive) eigenvalues of a four-dimensional metric. We see that the net result of transformation is replacement of gab with ratios of four-metric eigenvalues. We hope that the right-hand sides of the evolution equations [\eqref=dpsidt] and [\eqref=domegadt] may behave better than the right-hand sides of the original ADM equations.

We want to discuss now differences between the ESR formulation of Einstein's equations and other versions of 3+1 formulations of GR. Zelmanov [\cite=ZELMANOV], in his version of a 3+1 decomposition, chooses a congruence of time-like lines (motion of local reference frames), and then at each event on a time-line draws a small element of a three-dimensional space orthogonal to that line (a local three-dimensional reference frame). Einstein's equations in his formulation describe physical accelerations, deformations, and rotation of these reference frames (and physics of matter if space is not empty). There are no global three-dimensional slices embedded in a four-dimensional space-time in his formulation. In a classical ADM 3+1 formulation [\cite=ADM] of GR and subsequent 3+1 formulations, a four-dimensional space-time is split into a family of three-dimensional space-like slices and a universal "time" is introduced to label these slices. A global coordinate system exists on each slice, and a three-dimensional metric of slices evolves with time according to Einstein's equations and pre-determined gauge conditions. In tetrad formulations of GR [\cite=TETRAD], a family of orthogonal 4-vectors is introduced and Einstein's equations are formulated in terms of variables projected onto tetrad components.

The ESR formulation presented here is closest to a standard 3+1 ADM formulation. However, instead of metric and its derivatives, it uses variables which can be thought of in the following way. A three-dimensional metric defines an orthogonal triad of space-like vectors directed along the main axis of the metric tensor at each point of a hypersurface. ESR variables φi and θi tell how a three-dimensional coordinate system on a hypersurface must be rotated and re-scaled at each point so that it will locally coincide with a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system defined by the orthogonal triad at this point. The evolution of ESR variables is equivalent to the evolution of the three-dimensional metric and is governed by Einstein's equations written in terms of these variables plus the pre-defined gauge conditions. There is no orthogonal tetrad in this formulation.

From the above discussion it is clear that ESR 3+1 formulation presented here can be modified and extended by introducing new variables such as spatial derivatives of the metric, and by addition of various combination of constraints, similar to modifications introduced to a standard ADM formulation before [\cite=3+1]. Hyperbolicity and stability properties of ESR system and its modifications will be studied in subsequent publications. We plan to use this new system for numerical solutions of certain problems of GR.
