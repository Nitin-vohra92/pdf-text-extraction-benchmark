Discovery of a short plateau phase in the early evolution of a gamma-ray burst afterglow

Introduction

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic phenomena in the universe, which appear only for 0.01-100 s as brightest sources at the gamma-ray range ([\cite=kle73grboriginal]; [\cite=wij97GRB970228]). In a number of GRBs, afterglows have been detected in all wavelengths ([\cite=cos97xrayafterglow]; [\cite=fra97radioafterglow]). While their central engine is still poorly understood, it has been proposed that their behaviour can be well explained with a picture called the fireball model. In this model, a blast wave produced from a fireball propagates outward initially at highly relativistic velocity, and then, gradually decelerated by the collision with interstellar medium ([\cite=wax97fireball]). The GRB afterglow is proposed to be synchrotron emission from a forward shock region in an expanding shell colliding with external medium, whereas the GRB itself is from an internal shock region between shells ([\cite=wij97GRB970228]; [\cite=wax97afterglow]; [\cite=sar99prediction]). Early phase observations of afterglows would provide crucial clues for the initial extremely relativistic state of GRBs, however their rapid fading has prevented us from successful observations.

GRB021004 was detected by the HETE-2 satellite on 4 October 2002 at 12:06:13.57 UT ([\cite=shi02gcn1565]). A prompt identification of its burst position, which was notified 48 s after the burst, enabled observers to make observations of a very early phase of the afterglow of the GRB. A new bright optical source of Rc = 15.34 was discovered 6.56  ×  10- 3 day after the burst within the errorbox of the burst position, and then continuously monitored by a number of observers ([\cite=fox02gcn1564]). Owing to the quick notification and the apparently bright afterglow, GRB021004 provided a dense optical sampling of the time evolution of the GRB afterglow. Optical spectroscopic observations showed its redshift of z = 2.32 and its isotropic energy of Eiso = 5.6  ×  1052  erg  s -  1 ([\cite=mal02gcn1607]).

Observation and Result

Our unfiltered CCD photometric observations were performed with 25-cm and 30-cm telescopes at Kyoto University. The dark current image was subtracted from obtained CCD images, and then flat fielding was performed. We calculated differential magnitudes of GRB021004 with neighbour comparison stars (GSC1183.403, GSC1183.1526, and GSC1183.1261), whose constancy is better than 0.08 mag during our observation. We discarded images taken under heavily low transparency conditions to avoid systematic errors. Our equipment yields a magnitude system near the Rc-system since the sensitivity peak of the camera is near the peak of the Rc-system and spectra of GRB afterglows have smooth continuum without strong emission lines or absorption edge in the optical range. The difference between our unfiltered CCD and the Rc-system is less than 0.02 mag when the spectrum is described with a simple power law ([formula]) of the index - 2.0 < p < 0.3, which is consistent with observed spectra of GRB afterglows ([\cite=sar98grb]). Our magnitude system was translated to the Rc-system by taking cross-correlation with other observations reported in GRB Coordinate Network (GCN). The resulting light curve and magnitudes are shown in figure [\ref=fig:lc] and table [\ref=tab:mag]. In figure [\ref=fig:lc], the abscissa and the ordinate denote the time from the burst in day and the Rc-magnitude, respectively. Our observations are shown with the filled circles. Other symbols denote observations reported in GCN. The exposure time of each frame was 30 s, and the filled circles denote averaged points of several frames in the bin of Δ log tday  ~  0.07. The reason why the first four points have relatively large error bars is due to low transparency of the sky and shorter total exposure times of averaged data. Even in these early points, the afterglow was actually detected at 4-σ level, which is high enough for the discussion in the text.

We initiated time-series CCD photometric observations of GRB021004 on October 4 at 12:41:09 UT, about 0.024 day after the burst. The earliest positive observations detected a fading of the source from 6.56  ×  10- 3 to 1.19  ×  10- 2 day after the burst. Our observation covers a subsequent period from 2.44  ×  10- 2 to 0.292 day. As can be seen in figure 1, the first fading trend was terminated before our run. Our observations show that, after the initial fading phase, the object experienced a plateau phase during which it remained at almost constant brightness. The object again drastically changed its fading rate during our observation, and then entered an ordinary decay phase. Our χ2-fitting with two power laws ([formula]) and a transition time yields the best-fit parameters of a transition time of 0.13  ±  0.02  d, α1 =  - 0.03  ±  0.12  (t < 0.13  d), and α2 = 1.20  ±  0.36  (t > 0.13  d). We hence confirm that neither significant fading nor brightening is detectable in the light curve from 2.44  ×  10- 2 to 0.132 day. Even when we use only the earliest period up to 4.8  ×  10- 2 day, the fitting shows no significant fading or brightening trend. The fading rate after the plateau phase (α2) is in agreement with that calculated from other observations reported in GCN (α = 1.31  ±  0.03). This value of α2 during the ordinary decay phase is standard one among known afterglows.

Discussion

Our observation first revealed the presence of a plateau phase preceding the ordinary decay of the afterglow. According to the fireball model, the optical afterglow is predicted to start rapid fading when the observed frequency becomes larger than the typical synchrotron frequency, which rapidly moves to lower-frequency regions with time. On the other hand, during a very early phase when the optical flux is still dominated by the emission under the typical synchrotron frequency, the flux is predicted to increase, as [formula] in a case that the ambient medium has a constant density distribution ([\cite=sar98grb]). The time when the typical frequency passes through the optical range has been theoretically estimated to be ~  0.1 d after the burst with typical physical parameters for GRB afterglows ([\cite=sar99prediction]). We propose that the plateau phase of GRB021004 corresponds to a part of such an early phase of the ordinary afterglow from the forward shock. On the nature of the plateau phase, an alternative scenario may be possible that it is one of wiggles observed during the late phase ([formula]), which are apparently unusual compared with other GRB afterglows. However, the observed transition time from the early plateau to the decay phase is just what is expected from the theoretical calculation, which favors our scenario for the plateau phase. The fading trend cannot actually be described by a simple power-law between the first fading around 0.01 d and the late afterglow after 0.1 d ([\cite=mal02gcn1645]). The late wiggles in the afterglow light curve may have just been overlooked in previous GRBs because of their sparse sampling. The increase of the fading rate around 5 days can be naturally interpreted as a normal break as seen in other GRB afterglows.

The dashed line shown in figure 1 is the best fitted model light curve based on our picture for the plateau phase. We chose the smoothly broken power-law model (f(t) = (f1(t)- n + f2(t)- n)- 1 / n with fi(t) = kitαi) to describe our observations assuming α1 = 0.5 and α2 = 1.31 ([\cite=beu990510]). The parameter n provides a measure of the smoothness of the transition. It was calculated to be n = 0.92  ±  0.34, indicating a very smooth transition as expected in theoretical predictions ([\cite=gra02spec]). As can be seen in figure 1, this model well describes our observation. The transition time is calculated to be 0.10  ±  0.02  d in this case, which is in agreement with the result from fitting two power-laws within errors.

The initial rapid fading trend around 0.01 d should have another emission source, since, according to the forward shock model, the optical afterglow reaches its peak just before the ordinary decay phase. The first fading can be interpreted to be a tail of the optical flash which was detected only in one GRB afterglow, GRB990123 ([\cite=ake99GRB990123]; [\cite=kul99GRB990123]). It has been proposed that the optical flash originated from a reverse shock, while the ordinary afterglow originates from a forward external shock ([\cite=sar99GRB990123]; [\cite=mes99reverseshock]). In the case of GRB990123, the optical flash was observed until at least 0.01 d after the burst ([\cite=kul99GRB990123]). As seen in figure 1, the transition time from the flash to the plateau phase was also 0.01-0.02 d in the case of GRB021004.

As well as the similar activity around 0.01 d of these two GRBs, the beginnings of the ordinary decay phase were also observed at similar times around 0.1 d both in GRB021004 and GRB990123 ([\cite=kul99GRB990123]). These two GRBs hence have quite analogous light curves of afterglows, except for the plateau phase which were observed not in GRB990123, but in GRB021004. Our observation has first filled in the missing blank between the optical flash and the ordinary decay. The similarity of these two GRBs and our interpretation with the natural evolution of afterglows imply that the early light curve of the afterglow of GRB021004 is common, most fundamental features for GRB afterglows.

On the other hand, it is notable that the first fading, which we propose to be the optical flash, is more gradual compared with the fading branch of the optical flash in GRB990123 ([\cite=sar99GRB990123]). The relatively rapid fading after 0.1 d (in other words, a large α2) may also be rather atypical for other GRB afterglows ([\cite=sar99jets]). These observational features are possibly inconsistent with the picture which we propose, however, it is too premature to conclude it because we have only few dense, early phase samples of the light curve of GRB afterglows, like GRB021004. The validity of our proposed scenario will be evaluated by observations of color variations during the early phase of afterglows since the color of afterglows should dramatically change when the typical synchrotron frequency passes an observational band.
