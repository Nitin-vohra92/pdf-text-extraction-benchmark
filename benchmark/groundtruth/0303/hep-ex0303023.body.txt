Detecting the subdominant oscillation νμ  →  νe on the "atmospheric" scale of L / E has emerged as a priority for long-baseline accelerator experiments. This is because the νμ  →  νe and μ  →  e probabilities are sensitive to yet-unknown parameters of neutrino mixing: the mixing angle θ13, the sign of the "atmospheric" mass-squared difference Δm231, and the CP-violating phase δCP [\cite=review]. However, extracting the values of these parameters from measured probabilities will encounter the problem of degenerate solutions [\cite=degeneracies]. In particular, the asymmetry between P(νμ  →  νe) and P(μ  →  e) may arise from either the intrinsic CP violation and the matter effect that is correlated with the sign of Δm231 [\cite=matter]. The degeneracies can be resolved by comparing the data taken with a shorter and longer baselines [\cite=combine]. Selecting the latter as the "magic" baseline [formula] km will render this strategy particularly effective: for [formula], all Δm221-induced effects like CP violation are predicted to vanish up to second order of the small parameter Δm221  /  Δm231 [\cite=degeneracies] [\cite=magic]. Therefore, selecting [formula] may allow to uniquely determine sin 22θ13 and the sign of Δm231, but not δCP which should be probed with a shorter baseline.

In this paper, we discuss a conceptual experiment that involves a neutrino "superbeam" incident on a water Cherenkov detector over a magic baseline of L  =  7340 km. A water Cherenkov target is selected on the merit of good separation and spectrometry of electromagnetic showers [\cite=resolution], and is assumed to be a megaton-scale detector like UNO or Hyper-Kamiokande [\cite=detectors]. In tuning the energy of the neutrino beam, one must take into account that the Eν-dependence of oscillation probability for L  =  7340 km is strongly affected by Earth matter: for Δm231  >  0, the matter effect [\cite=matter] shifts the first maximum of P(νμ  →  νe)  down to [formula] GeV/eV2 from the vacuum value of [formula] GeV/eV2. Assuming Δm231  =  0.003 eV2, the oscillation maximum is at Eν≃7.5 GeV which conveniently matches the peak of νμ flux in the "Medium-Energy" (or PH2me) beam of Fermilab's Main Injector, as designed for the NuMI-MINOS program [\cite=numi]. Therefore, this is selected as the model beam in our simulation. We assume [formula] protons on neutrino target per year, as expected upon the planned upgrade of Main Injector's intensity [\cite=driver]. In the absence of oscillations, the beam will produce some 58 νμCC (21 μCC) events per 1 kton×  yr in the far detector with the ν ([formula]) setting of the focusing system.

At neutrino energies below 1 GeV, as in the proposed JHF-Kamioka experiment [\cite=jhf2k], νe appearance can be efficiently detected in a water Cherenkov apparatus by selecting 1-ring e-like events of the reaction νeN  →  e-X that is dominated by quasielastics. (Here and in what follows, X denotes a system of hadrons other than the π0, in which the momenta of all charged particles are below the Cherenkov threshold in water.) At substantially higher energies considered in this paper, using the 1e signature of νμ  →  νe is complicated by more background from the flavor-blind NC reaction νN  →  νπ0X: its cross section increases with Eν, and so does the fraction of π0 mesons whose γγ decays produce a single e-like ring in the water Cherenkov detector. In [\cite=multi], we have demonstrated that νe appearance can be analyzed with less NC background by detecting the reactions νeN  →  e-π+X and νeN  →  e-π0X that involve emission of a charged or neutral pion. We proceed to briefly describe the selections of these CC reactions, as formulated in [\cite=multi].

The reaction νeN  →  e-π+X is selected by requiring two rings in the detector, of which one is e-like and the other is non-showering and has a large emission angle of θπ  >  500. This is referred to as the "eπ signature". The selection θπ  >  500 is aimed at suppressing the NC reaction νp  →  νπ0p in which the momentum of the final proton is above the Cherenkov threshold. The residual NC background is largely due to the reaction νN  →  νπ0π±X with two pions in the final state. The νμCC background arises from the reaction νμN  →  μ-π0X in which the muon is emitted at a broad angle. The ντCC background arises from the dominant oscillation νμ  →  ντ followed by ντN  →  τ-π+X and τ-  →  e-ν.

The reaction νeN  →  e-π0X is selected by requiring either three e-like rings of which two fit to g, or two e-like rings that would not fit to a π0. This is referred to as the "multi-e signature". The NC background arises from the reaction νN  →  νπ0π0N in which at least one of the two π0 mesons has not been reconstructed. Note that in the latter reaction the two π0 mesons are emitted with comparable energies, whereas in νeN  →  e-π0X the e- tends to be the leading particle. This suggests a selection based on the absolute value of asymmetry A  =  (E1 - E2) / (E1 + E2), where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two showers for the two-ring signature, and of the reconstructed π0 and the "odd" shower--for the three-ring signature. In this paper, we use the selection |A|  >  0.6. The ντCC background is largely due to electronic decays of τ leptons produced in association with a π0. The νμCC background originates from CC events with a muon below the Cherenkov threshold and two π0 mesons in the final state, and is negligibly small.

In the simulation, the matter effect is accounted for in the approximation of uniform matter density along the neutrino path (〈ρ〉  =  4.3 g/cm3 for L  =  7340 km), which adequately reproduces the results of exact calculations for the actual density profile of the Earth [\cite=matter]. Relevant neutrino-mixing parameters are assigned the values consistent with the atmospheric and reactor data [\cite=atmo] [\cite=chooz]: Δm231  =    ±  0.003 eV2, sin 22θ23  =  1, and sin 22θ13  =  0.01 (the latter value is ten times below the upper limit imposed in [\cite=chooz]). The simulation relies on the neutrino-event generator NEUGEN based on the Soudan-2 Monte Carlo [\cite=neugen], that takes full account of exclusive channels like quasielastics and excitation of baryon resonances.

The [formula] distributions of 1e-like, eπ-like, and multi-e-like events are illustrated in Fig. [\ref=three], assuming Δm231  >  0 and incident neutrinos. Here, [formula] stands for the net energy of all e-like rings. Total background to the νμ  →  νe signal is seen to be the greatest for 1e-like events, and therefore we drop these from further analysis. Combined [formula]  distributions of eπ-like and multi-e-like events are shown in Fig. [\ref=together] for either beam setting and either sign of Δm231. With equal ν and [formula] exposures of 1 Mton×  yr, the oscillation signal reaches some 250 events for Δm231  >  0 and incident neutrinos, and some 140 events for Δm231  <  0 and incident antineutrinos.

The experimental strategy we adopt is to share the overall exposure between the ν and [formula] running so as to equalize the expected backgrounds under the νμ  →  νe and μ  →  e signals, and then analyze the difference between the [formula]  distributions for the ν and [formula] beams. The motivation is that many systematic uncertainties on the background should cancel out in the difference. The ν and [formula] backgrounds are approximately equalized by running 1.7-1.8 times longer in the [formula] mode than in the ν mode (see Fig. [\ref=together]). The difference between the [formula] distributions for the ν and [formula] beams, assuming ν and [formula] exposures of 1.0 and 1.8 Mton×  yr, is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=difference]. Depending on the sign of Δm231, this distribution shows either a bump or a dip at oscillation maximum with respect to the background that corresponds to sin 22θ13  =  0.

In order to estimate the significance of the oscillation signal in Fig. [\ref=difference], we vary the [formula] interval so as to maximize the "figure of merit" [formula]. Here, Sν and [formula] are the numbers of νμ  →  νe and μ  →  e events falling within the [formula] interval, and Bν and [formula] are corresponding numbers of background events. We obtain F  =   + 19.6 for Δm231  >  0, and F  =   - 20.8 for Δm231  <  0. Recalling that these figures refer to sin 22θ13  =  0.01, we estimate that at 90% CL the sensitivity to either sin 22θ13 and the sign of Δm231 will be maintained down to [formula]. Still lower values of sin 22θ13 may perhaps be probed with a neutrino factory in combination with a magnetized iron-scintillator detector [\cite=factory] [\cite=magic]. Note however that the experimental scheme proposed in this paper is based on proven technology and involves a multi-purpose facility [\cite=detectors] rather than a dedicated detector.

To summarize, we have examined the physics potential of an experiment with a neutrino superbeam that irradiates a Megaton-scale water Cherenkov detector over the "magic" baseline ~  7300 km. With realistic beam intensity and exposure, the experiment may probe sin 22θ13 and the sign of Δm231 down to sin 22θ13 values below 10- 3. Thus obtained values of these parameters, that are not affected by degeneracies, can then be used as input for extracting δCP from the data collected with a shorter baseline as in the JHF-Kamioka experiment [\cite=jhf2k].
