Department of Mathematics, Eckerd College, FL 33711

Abstract. In this note we shall improve some congruences of G.S. Kazandzidis and D.F. Bailey to higher prime power moduli, by studying the relation between irregular pairs of the form (p,p - 3) and refined version of Wolstenholme's theorem.

Introduction

Let H1(n) be the nth partial sum of the harmonic series. It is a classical result commonly attributed to Wolstenholme [\cite=HW] that for any prime p  ≥  5

[formula]

It's also known [\cite=ELeh] that [formula] if and only if (p,p - 3) is an irregular pair, namely, p divides the numerator of Bp - 3. Here we define the Bernoulli numbers Bk by the Maclaurin series

[formula]

There is another important equivalent statement of Wolstenholme's Theorem by using combinatorics. D.F. Bailey [\cite=Bailey] generalizes it to the following form.

([\cite=Bailey]) Let n and r be non-negative integers and p  ≥  5 be a prime. Then

[formula]

where we set [formula] if n < r.

He further obtains the following variation of Lucas' Theorem.

Let N, R, n and r be non-negative integers and p  ≥  5 be a prime. Suppose n,r < p. Then

[formula]

In late 1960's G. S. Kazandzidis worked on similar congruences. Define for any integer n and any positive integer r

[formula]

Among many results he obtained in [\cite=K1] [\cite=K2] the followings are particular relevant to our study

Let n be any integer and r be any positive integers and p  ≥  3 be a prime. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here [\eqref=equ:K1] and [\eqref=equ:K2] are equivalent.

In this short note we will refine the above results for primes p > 5 by using higher prime power modulus (see Theorem [\ref=thm:1]. This is best possible in the sense that the result would be wrong if we allowed p = 5. Note that in [\cite=K2] Kazandzidis obtains an improved version of his congruences of Theorem [\ref=K1] by replacing the modulus by [formula], where [formula] denotes the highest power of the prime p that divides N. This improvement does not follow from our result in this paper. However, it does not imply ours either.

In the last section of this paper we provide an interesting congruence involving Bernoulli numbers of the form Bp - 3 for odd primes p. The author wishes to thank the referee for pointing out Kazandzidis' work [\cite=K1] [\cite=K2] and many other valuable comments which makes this note more readable.

Preliminaries and Some Notation

Define the Euler-Zagier multiple zeta functions of depth d by

[formula]

for complex variables [formula] satisfying [formula] for all [formula]. The special values of multiple zeta functions at positive integers have significant arithmetic and algebraic meanings, whose defining series [\eqref=zeta] will be called MZV series, and whose nth partial sum is

[formula]

Note that partial sums exist even for divergent MVZ [formula] such as the harmonic series ζ(1). When an ordered set [formula] is repeated d times we abbreviate it as [formula]. From the definitions [\eqref=zeta] and [\eqref=equ:defn] one derives easily the so called shuffle relations. For example

[formula]

because

[formula]

Similarly, one has

[formula]

Recall that Stirling numbers S(n,j) of the first kind are defined by the expansion

[formula]

These numbers are related to the partial sums of nested harmonic series:

[formula]

For example, S(n,n) = 1, S(n,n - 1) = n(n - 1) / 2, and S(n,1) = (n - 1)!. In particular, if n = p is a prime we then have

[formula]

Comparing fp(p) = p! we recover the Wolstenhomle's Theorem.

One last thing we need in this note is the following generalization of [\eqref=equ:wols].

Let s and d be two positive integers. Let p be an odd prime such that p  ≥  sd + 3. Then

[formula]

Main Results

Our first result improves on Theorem [\ref=b1] of Bailey and Theorem [\ref=K1] of Kazandzidis simultaneously for all primes greater than 5.

For any prime p  ≥  5 by Wostenholme's theorem [\eqref=equ:wols] we define wp < p2 to be the unique non-negative integer such that [formula]. It is a well-known fact that (see for eg. [\cite=Gl])

[formula]

Let n and r be non-negative integers and p  ≥  7 be a prime. Then

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

for all n,r if and only if p divides the numerator of Bp - 3.

When p = 5 Theorem [\ref=thm:1] does not hold. Indeed, it's easy to see that H1(4) = 25 / 12 so w5 = 23. Now take n = 4 and r = 1. Then

[formula]

Clearly we may assume n > r. To save space we write Hk = H({1}k;p - 1) throughout this proof. By equation [\eqref=fx] we have

[formula]

By relation [\eqref=Stirling] and Lemma [\ref=genWols] we have

[formula]

Now it follows quickly from [\eqref=equ:wols] and the shuffle relation [\eqref=shuf] that

[formula]

By substitution k  →  p - k we further can see that Congruence [\eqref=H12p] is obtained by Lemma [\ref=genWols] (so we indeed need the condition p  ≥  7) while the last step follows from [\eqref=H12]. Therefore by [\eqref=equ:wols] congruence [\eqref=midd] is reduced to This proves congruence [\eqref=main]. The last statement of the theorem follows from [\eqref=Gl] immmediately.

By induction on the exponent the following corollary is obvious.

Let p  ≥  7 be a prime and let r and n be two non-negative integers. Then for any exponent e  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

Next we consider a refined version of Theorem [\ref=b2] of Bailey.

Let N, R, n and r be non-negative integers and p  ≥  7 be a prime. If r  ≤  n < p then

[formula]

where c(N,R,n,r;p) = H1(n)N - H1(r)R + (wpNR - H1(n - r))(N - R). If n < r < p then

[formula]

Clearly we can assume that N  ≥  R. Observe that we have a variant of fn(x) defined by [\eqref=fx]:

[formula]

First let r  ≤  n < p. Then by straight-forward expansion we have by Corollary [\ref=exp] and the fact that H1(m) is p-integral if m < p. Congruence [\eqref=1cong] follows immediately.

(1) If p = 5 then the congruence [\eqref=1cong] of Theorem [\ref=thm:2] is not true anymore. For example, take N = 3,n = 4,R = r = 1. Then c(3,1,4,1;5) = 1675 / 12. So

[formula]

(2) If p = 5 then congruence [\eqref=2cong] of Theorem [\ref=thm:2] still holds for all possible N,R < 55 and n < r < 5. I believe this is true for all other N and R.

An interesting sum related to ζ(1,2)

The last result of this note is related to the above theme and has some independent interest. We discovered this when trying to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:1] in the special case r = 1 following Gardiner's suggestion in [\cite=Gardiner]. We failed but obtained this unexpected byproduct.

Suppose p is an odd prime. Then

[formula]

By the shuffle relation [\eqref=shuf] and Lemma [\ref=genWols] we have

[formula]

So the first congruence is obvious. Let's prove the second.

The cases p = 3 and 5 can be checked easily:

Suppose now p  ≥  7. Let's go through Gardiner's proof of [\cite=Gardiner]. Let n > 3 be a positive integer (we will take n = p - 1 later). Combinatorial consideration leads us to

[formula]

where X and Y are given by the two sums in [\eqref=2sum] respectively. Recall from [\eqref=fx] and [\eqref=Stirling]

[formula]

Hence As for Y we have Y = 0 if n = 2. If n  ≥  3 then

[formula]

Putting every thing together with n = p - 1, comparing to [\eqref=main] with r = 1, using the fact [formula] from [\eqref=H12p], and canceling the factor n(n - 1) / 2, we arrive at

[formula]

With n = p - 1 this simplifies to

[formula]

whence the second congruence in the proposition.

Combining Proposition [\ref=prop:ijk] with [\cite=wols] we find the following corollary.

For any prime p  ≥  5

[formula]

(1) We know that among all the primes p less than 12 million p divides the numerator of Bp - 3 only for p = 16843 and p = 2124679 (see [\cite=BCEMS]). However, we believe there exist infinitely many such primes.

(2) In a recent paper Ji provides a proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:ijk] without using partial sums of MZV series (see [\cite=Ji]). In more recent preprints he [\cite=J2] and independently, Zhou and Cai [\cite=zc], generalize this to sums of arbitrary lengths: let p  ≥  5 be a prime and n  ≤  p - 2 a positive integer then
