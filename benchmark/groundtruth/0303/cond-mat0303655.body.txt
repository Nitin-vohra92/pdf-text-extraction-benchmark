Perturbative results on localization for a driven two-level system

Introduction

Quantum computation[\cite=qc1] [\cite=qc2] [\cite=qc3] [\cite=qc4], intended as information theory performed using qubits, that is, two-level systems evolving by the unitary evolution as obtained by the laws of quantum mechanics, demands an increasing control on such systems.

Recent experimental findings[\cite=ex5] [\cite=ex6] [\cite=ex7] [\cite=ex8] [\cite=ex9] proved that qubits can be realized by solid state devices, making the realization of a quantum computer even more possible. Such solid state devices performs in a way or another like two-level systems driven externally by some time-varying field. This means that it is very important a clear theoretical understanding of them to make their control easier.

Advances in this way have been realized by devising new approaches to the solution of the Schrödinger equation in different regimes[\cite=mt9] [\cite=mt10] [\cite=mt11] [\cite=mt12] [\cite=mt13] [\cite=mt14]. These methods are perturbative in their nature but permit to study a quantum system in different physical regimes. So, they seems to be a proper framework to make two-level systems theoretically manageable in any situation. These methods give to the Floquet method, for periodical perturbations, a strong analytical support.

The proper control of a qubit, realized by some solid state device, relies on the possibility to obtain localization of a particle in each one of the two available states. This effect is also known as coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT)[\cite=hanggi1] [\cite=hanggi2] as, tunneling between one state and the other is destroyed by making unity the probability of staying of the particle in the initial state. So, this question has been recently the main motivation for several works on two-level systems[\cite=tl15] [\cite=tl16] [\cite=tl17] [\cite=tl18]. Some of these papers have put forward an interesting non perturbative result showing a set of curves for the crossing of the quasi-energies of the Floquet solution for two-level systems with different periodical external fields. As it stands, such a result, being not perturbative in its very nature, appears rather difficult to recover with perturbation theories.

The aim of this paper is to show how perturbation theory can give definite results for localization in different regimes, putting the study of two-level systems on a sound ground from an analytical point of view. Besides, an expression is given for localization, after that an effective time-independent Hamiltonian is obtained using perturbation theory. Our results confirm till third order the well-known result that the zeros of the zero-th order Bessel function are the points where CDT occurs. Besides, our result recovers the small perturbation theory computation in the proper limits. This is in agreement with the recent numerical computations [\cite=tl17] [\cite=tl18]. But, it is essential to emphasize that the main result of the paper, the strong coupling expansion, is very accurate for high-frequency driving fields.

The paper is so structured. In Sec. [\ref=sec2] we discuss localization on a quite general ground, using Floquet theory. In Sec. [\ref=sec3] we give a presentation of the perturbation methods we use to obtain our results. In Sec. [\ref=sec4] we present the computation for the two-level system driven by a sinusoidal field giving the effective time-independent Hamiltonian obtained by a computation till second order. In Sec. [\ref=sec5] we give the third order correction to the effective Hamiltonian showing how the localization condition at high fields is kept in agreement with all numerical results as also happens to the small field condition. Then we discuss the conditions under which localization happens comparing the perturbation series obtained with the weak perturbation series showing the way one result contains the other. Finally, in Sec. [\ref=sec6] conclusions are given.

Localization in driven two-level systems

The model we consider has the Hamiltonian

[formula]

being Δ the separation between the two levels, g the coupling, σ1 and σ3 Pauli matrices and f(t) = f(t + T) with T the period of the perturbation. The theory of CDT [\cite=hanggi1] [\cite=hanggi2] can be straightforwardly applied. Given the unitary evolution operator U(t), one can compute the probability of the system of being in the initial state as

[formula]

with|ψ(0)〉 being one of the eigenstates of σ3. One has CDT when this probability is equal to unity. As the Hamiltonian is periodic in time, one can apply the Floquet theory and take[\cite=Hanggi3]

[formula]

to ascertain that we have true localization by having unity also in this case. The consequence is that one can show, again from Floquet theory, that the conditions for CDT arise from crossing of quasi-energies. This condition is necessary but not sufficient.

Our aim in the following is to derive such conditions that apply to the quasi-energies for the sinusoidal case, that is, assuming f(t) =  cos (ωt) with ω  =  2π / T. We give an explicit analytical expression for the Floquet eigenstates and quasi-energies by using perturbation theory in the strong coupling regime with the method described in the next section.

Dual Dyson series and resummation techniques

It is generally believed that perturbation theory, being plagued by secularities , that is, unbounded terms in a perturbation series that increase as powers of time, [formula], should be avoided to treat a model like the one we consider in this paper. Indeed, the methods devised so far for removing such singular terms proved to be generally not very easy to apply. Recently, a new approach, that can be called dynamical renormalization group method [\cite=rg1] [\cite=rg2] [\cite=rg3] [\cite=rg4] [\cite=rg5] [\cite=rg6], has given an algorithmic way to remove secularities, making computation in perturbation theory just tedious but very easy to accomplish. This method, coupled with the dual Dyson series [\cite=fra1] [\cite=fra2] [\cite=fra3] [\cite=fra4] [\cite=fra5], gives a straightforward method to compute higher order corrections to well known results [\cite=hanggi2]. Besides, we will get an explicit analytical expression for the Floquet modes and the quasi-energies in the given approximation and we will prove that the small coupling result is recovered. This is a property of the dual Dyson series.

The dynamical renormalization group method was firstly formulated by the Urbana Group [\cite=rg1] [\cite=rg2] based on the observation that renormalization group methods can be seen as a means of asymptotic analysis [\cite=rg1]. They showed how their approach can be proven equivalent to other methods that resum secularities, such as the multiple time scale method [\cite=kc], for many cases. This method, for its very nature, can be described by an example. So, let us consider the well-known equation of the forced harmonic oscillator

[formula]

being ε the strength of the anharmonic term assumed to be small. A naive perturbation expansion in ε till first order gives the well-known result

[formula]

being A0 and φ0 constants depending on the initial conditions. We recognize a secular term t - t0 that makes this series useless as it breaks down for ε(t - t0) > 1. The situation can be improved if we interpret the time t0 as the logarithm of the ultraviolet cutoff in quantum field theory and introduce A and φ as the renormalized counterpart of A0 and φ0 due to the fact that the nonlinearity may change these constants. Then, we introduce another renormalization point by splitting t - t0 in t - τ  +  τ  -  t0 and adsorb the terms containing τ - t0 into A and φ. We introduce a multiplicative renormalization constant [formula] and an additive one [formula] so that A0(t0) = Z1(t0,τ)A(τ) and φ0(t0) = φ(τ) + Z2(t0,τ) with the coefficients an and bn to be computed order by order to remove the terms with τ - t0 as happens in standard renormalization group [\cite=gl1] [\cite=gl2]. It is easily seen that, in our case, a possible choice to first order is a1 = 0 and [formula] removing the secular term and we are left with

[formula]

being now A and φ function of τ. But τ does not appear in the original problem and so x(t) must be independent on it. This gives us the condition

[formula]

that is the renormalization group equation that in our case gives the equations

[formula]

where the well-known shift in the frequency of the oscillator is recovered. Besides, the secularity is completely removed by taking into eq.([\ref=eq:x]) the condition τ = t with A(t) and φ(t) given by the solutions of the renormalization group equations. We have finally

[formula]

So, a straightforward application of renormalization group methods has permitted to remove a secular term in the perturbation series. But there is a way to make the computation simpler by noting that we have done nothing else than to compute the envelope of eq.([\ref=eq:xn]) using known renormalization techniques.

Then, the method of renormalization group to resum secularities in a perturbation series that we present here is obtained by the mathematical theory of envelopes and is due to Kunihiro [\cite=rg3] [\cite=rg4] [\cite=rg5]. In order to describe it, let us consider the following equation

[formula]

with x(t) that can be also a vector. The initial condition is given by x(t0) = X(t0). At this stage we assume X(t0) not yet specified. We write the solution of this equation as x(t;t0,X(t0)) that is exact. If we change t0 to t0' we are able to determine X(t0) by assuming that the solution should not change

[formula]

that in the limit t0  →  t0' becomes

[formula]

giving the evolution equation or flow equation of the initial value X(t0). We see again the renormalization group equation proper to this approach.

Till now, all our equations are exact and no perturbation theory entered in any part of our argument. But, except for a few cases, the solution x(t;t0,X(t0)) is only known perturbatively and such a solution is generally valid only locally, i.e. for t  ~  t0 and t  ~  t0' and a more restrictive request should be demanded to our renormalization group equation

[formula]

But this equation can be interpreted by the mathematical theory of envelopes [\cite=rg3]. Indeed, varying t0 we have that x(t;t0,X(t0)) is a family of curves with t0 as a characterizing parameter. Then, eq.([\ref=eq:rg]) becomes an equation to compute the envelope of such a family of curves. Such an envelope is given by x(t;t0 = t) = X(t), the initial condition. It can be proven that X(t) satisfies the equation ([\ref=eq:xf]) in a global domain up to the order x(t;t0) for t  ~  t0.

Now, we can describe our approach in some steps to show how such an algorithmic perturbation method indeed works

Consider the following unitary transformation on the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:H]) (here and in the following we set 1) to remove the perturbation [\cite=fra1] [\cite=fra2]

[formula]

giving the transformed Hamiltonian

[formula]

the dual Dyson series is computed by [\cite=fra1] [\cite=fra2] [\cite=fra3] [\cite=fra4]

[formula]

being as usual T the time ordering operator and an ordering parameter ε has been introduced that will be taken unity at the end of computation. It is fundamental for our argument that the computation of this series is performed at a different starting point t0.

Assume, at the start, that the time evolution operator has the form

[formula]

where UR(t0) is a "renormalizable" part of the unitary evolution.

At the given order one gets SD(t,t0) as

[formula]

and, at this stage, if some oscillating functions in t0 appear like e- iωt0 then introduce the phase φ(t0)  =   - t0 as a "renormalizable" parameter rewriting it as eiωφ(t0)[\cite=rg6]. We make this choice assuming that any initial phase of the system can be changed by the dynamics. The minus sign is fixed arbitrarily. The secularities must be left untouched.

Eliminate the dependence on t0 by requiring[\cite=rg3] [\cite=rg4]

[formula]

and one obtains the renormalization group equation

[formula]

where, at some stage, to obtain such equations at the second order, we have to use their expressions at the first order and, to compute their form at order n-th, one has to use these equations at the order (n - 1)-th, into the condition ([\ref=eq:rgcond]). This is a step toward the computation of the envelope of the perturbation series [\cite=rg3] [\cite=rg4].

Finally, the renormalization equations should be solved and substituted into the equation

[formula]

giving the solution, i.e. the envelope, we were looking for without secularities at the order we made the computation.

We will give an explicit application of this procedure in the next section choosing f(t) =  cos (ωt), that is, a sinusoidal driving.

Structure of the perturbation series to second order

The unitary transformation UF(t) for a sinusoidal driving field takes the form

[formula]

and the transformed Hamiltonian takes the form

[formula]

having put [formula]. This Hamiltonian gives the term SD(t,t0) till first order as

[formula]

where Jn(z) are the Bessel functions of n-th order being n an integer. We see immediately that a secular term, proportional to t - t0, plagues our computation. To remove it we rewrite the above expression as

[formula]

introducing into the last oscillating term the renormalizable parameter φ(t0). So, one has

[formula]

and imposing the condition ([\ref=eq:rgcond]) we get the renormalization group equations

[formula]

where use has been made of the fact that these equations are at least first order, transforming some terms in eq.([\ref=eq:fo]) into second order, making them negligible. We see that we have recovered a well known result of the series for high frequency[\cite=hanggi2] with its corrections to first order. This gives the final result, using eq.([\ref=eq:u]),

[formula]

This result is well-known in literature[\cite=fra3] [\cite=fra5] [\cite=mt10] [\cite=mt11]. It is also been proven that this is the expression of the Floquet unitary evolution at this order with the given approximations[\cite=mt10] [\cite=mt11]. We see that we have a periodic part and a part that originates the quasi-energies.

So, what is really interesting is to get higher order corrections. Particularly, we see that the quasi-energies are given by [formula], a well-known fact, so that, CDT occurs, in this approximation, at the zeros of the Bessel function J0(z)[\cite=hanggi2]. We now prove that higher order corrections preserve such a result.

Applying the above procedure till second order it is straightforward to obtain

[formula]

where we have introduced the function [formula] into the last exponential. We recognize a product of a periodic unitary operator and a term originating quasi-energies. So, it is interesting to see that now we have an effective Hamiltonian giving the quasi-energies with a correction term proportional to σ1. But, the most important point is that this correction is again proportional to J0(z) and so, the zeros of this Bessel function gives CDT also at second order. The effective Hamiltonian can be written as

[formula]

that can be easily diagonalized but we do not pursue this matter here. Indeed, our aim in the next section will be to give the third order correction to this Hamiltonian proving that the high-frequency CDT is again determined by the zeros of J0(z).

Third-order correction to the quasi-energies and localization

The algebra is rather tedious but straightforward and the application of our method gives the third order correction to the effective Hamiltonian

[formula]

This is a correction to the σ3 term of the effective Hamiltonian so, we can conjecture that even order corrections go to the σ1 term and the odd order corrections go to the σ3 term. We see again that this term is proportional to J0(z) confirming the exactness in the high-frequency limit of the occurring of the CDT at the zeros of such a Bessel function. Such correcting terms into the effective Hamiltonian can be recognized as a.c. Stark shifts and Bloch-Siegert shifts and are relevant, eventually, at the resonance[\cite=rg6] [\cite=fra6] where Rabi flopping also in this regime is expected with the renormalized levels [formula].

Anyhow, a further check can be obtained with the small coupling perturbation theory. Our method can be applied again but now we use the interaction picture. So, if we introduce the unitary transformation [formula], we get the transformed Hamiltonian

[formula]

and we can built the Dyson series, out of resonance (Δ  ≠  ω), to second order as

[formula]

A rather interesting result is that this series holds for any ratio [formula] differently from the dual Dyson series discussed above that holds for [formula]. From the effective Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:heff]) and the third order correction we see that the coefficient of the σ3 part is given by

[formula]

that in the small coupling approximation, being [formula], and considering just the first term of the series giving [formula], we obtain

[formula]

From the small coupling expansion we recognize, after a simple rearranging of the terms, the σ3 term

[formula]

that, in the expected limit [formula], is the same as S3. Similarly, one can verify the same result at any order of the two perturbation series. This gives an a posteriori verification of our computations. Besides, it confirms our point that the dual Dyson series is a high-frequency series while the Dyson series holds for both the limits of high and low frequencies, but the result of the Dyson series in the high-frequency limit is contained in the dual Dyson series when the limit of small coupling z  →  0 is also taken. Indeed, the Dyson series and the dual Dyson series can be taken to coincide in the limits of small z and [formula], giving an interesting relationship between the transformed Hamiltonians we use to obtain the perturbation series.

We are now in a position to discuss the CDT in the limit of small coupling z  →  0. For our aim, we consider the analytical expression of the quasi-energies obtained in Ref.[\cite=zhao]. This gives

[formula]

that yields, in the limit z  ≪  1, eq.([\ref=eq:S'3]) proving again the correctness of our computations. The important point is that eq.([\ref=eq:zhao]) contain the result for CDT that the quasi-energies crosses for [formula] being n an integer and this cannot happen for the perturbative result unless we are able to resum the series. So, we can draw the conclusion that perturbation theory by Dyson series can prove to be very effective for the study of CDT for strong fields and high-frequency regime.

Discussion and conclusions

From the von Neumann-Wigner theorem [\cite=vNW] one has to expect that the crossings of the energy levels form a one-dimensional manifold. This result is central to fully understand CDT for the two-level system we considered. Recent works on this question derived such a result numerically [\cite=tl17] [\cite=tl18]. In this paper we have shown that, unless some smart resummation technique is applied to a perturbation series, perturbation theory is helpful just to study the behavior of the model in different regimes, recovering CDT under certain conditions.

The reason for this conclusion lies on the fact that the content of the von Neumann-Wigner theorem is non-perturbative. So, if we are able to resum a perturbation series to recover a non-perturbative result, there may be a possibility to give an analytical proof of the numerical results obtained so far.

Notwithstanding such a conclusion, we have proved the power of the Dyson series in the study of two-level systems in regimes where other means may prove unsuccessful, giving explicitly the form of the Floquet modes till second order and quasi-energies till third order, for a strong field and high frequency. At this stage, it appears mandatory to introduce resummation techniques in perturbation theory to complete the algorithmic approach we discussed in this paper.

Different regimes of parameter space have been analyzed by our perturbation technique. Notably, we have obtained perturbation series for the high-frequency regime Δ  ≪  ω in the strong coupling approximation g  ≫  Δ by dual Dyson series. The Dyson series has given the small coupling expansion g  ≪  Δ that holds for any ratio [formula] but when this ratio is taken to be small, the dual Dyson series recovers the Dyson series for g  ≪  Δ as we have shown. These results appear very promising for the study of quantum systems in different regimes by a general way to approach computations with perturbation theory.
