Introduction

The magnetic and electric dipole moments of fermions contain important information about their nature and interactions. On the one hand, concerning the magnetic moments, the precise measurements of the g - 2 values of the electron and the muon provide, among other things, an accurate test of the point-like character of both leptons. However, limits on the magnetic dipole moment of the tau lepton, of the neutrinos and of the different quark species are much poorer.

On the other hand, the most stringent limits on electric dipole moments concern the neutron and the electron, and this sets strong constraints on some of the CP-violating parameters. Using quark-model arguments, one is able to infer upper bounds on the electric dipole moments of the up and down quarks from the neutron measurements. However, again the electric dipole moments of the tau lepton, of the neutrinos, and of the second and third generation quarks are much less constrained.

The aim of the present paper is to extract "indirect" limits on fermion moments using the electroweak data, in the context of an effective Lagrangian approach. Our main idea is fairly simple. The effective Lagrangian that may induce fermion moments different from the Standard Model expectations inevitably induces anomalous couplings of the neutral boson Z to fermions. We will obtain constraints on these anomalous couplings using the available electroweak data, and these contraints will provide bounds on the fermion magnetic and electric moments.

Let us define here the general electromagnetic matrix element describing the interaction of a fermion with the photon. For a charged fermion one usually defines

[formula]

where e  Qf is the fermion charge, and q = p2 - p1. The form factors F2 and F3, evaluated in the static limit, correspond to the anomalous magnetic moment

[formula]

and to the electric dipole moment

[formula]

The electromagnetic interactions of neutrinos are described in terms of

[formula]

with [formula] the Bohr magneton. In units of μB, the neutrino magnetic moment is

[formula]

and the electric dipole moment is

[formula]

In the following section we discuss the general analysis of the fermion moments in the linear effective Lagrangian approach, and in section 3 we describe our procedure to extract our limits and find them. The non-linear effective Lagrangian approach is discussed in section 4. In section 5 we present our main conclusions.

Linear effective Lagrangian analysis of fermion moments

Deviations from the electroweak Standard Model (SM) realized in its minimal linear form, with a perturbative scalar sector, can be treated by using effective Lagrangians. The general idea of the linear effective Lagrangian approach is that theories beyond the SM, emerging at some characteristic energy scale Λ, have effects at low energies E  ≤  G- 1 / 2F, and these effects can be taken into account by considering a Lagrangian that extends the SM Lagrangian, LSM:

[formula]

The effective Lagrangian Leff contains operators of increasing dimension that are built with the SM fields including the scalar sector, and is organized as an expansion in powers of (1 / Λ).

The success of the SM at the level of quantum corrections can be considered as a check of the gauge symmetry properties of the model. To preserve the consistency of the low energy theory, with a Lagrangian given by Eq. ([\ref=L]), we will assume that Leff is [formula] gauge invariant. Some of the problems that originate when dealing with non-gauge invariant interactions have been discussed in [\cite=EDU] [\cite=KEK]. The gauge-invariant operators that dominate at low energies have dimension 6 and have been listed in [\cite=BUCHMULLER_&_LEUNG]. We will now write the set of operators that would contribute to the dipole moments we are interested in. For each one of the listed operators, its hermitian conjugate will also contribute to the corresponding moment. We will not display the hermitian conjugate, although we considered it in our calculations.

Given a charged lepton [formula], there are two operators contributing to its magnetic dipole moment

[formula]

where L is the lepton isodoublet containing [formula] and [formula] the singlet partner. As we will see, the operators will involve the U(1) and SU(2) field strengths,

[formula]

as well as the Higgs field Φ or its conjugate  = iσ2Φ*. When considering quarks we have to distinguish between up-type and down-type induced magnetic moments. When the quark is U = u,c or t, we have contributions coming from

[formula]

where Q is the corresponding quark isodoublet, while for the case D = d,s or b one has

[formula]

Let us now display the operators contributing to the electric dipole moments. For the charged leptons we have

[formula]

while for U = u,c,t we have

[formula]

and finally, for D = d,s,b

[formula]

The case of the neutrino dipole moments has to be treated separately. We need to enlarge the minimal SM by adding the right-handed neutrinos νeR,νμR,ντR. Once this is done, we have the following operators contributing to the neutrino magnetic moment

[formula]

and to the neutrino electric dipole moment

[formula]

In ([\ref=NU]) and ([\ref=TILDENU]), L is the lepton isodoublet containing [formula].

The effective Lagrangian to be considered can now be written as a linear combination of the operators we have listed

[formula]

It is clear that below the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking the effective Lagrangian in Eq. ([\ref=Leff]) induces contributions to the anomalous magnetic moments af and the electric moments df. Substituting

[formula]

with [formula], one gets the following contributions

[formula]

for any charged fermion f being the up-type component of the lepton and quark isodoublets, and

[formula]

for the down-type components. We have defined the dimensionless parameters

[formula]

valid for any fermion, and cw  =   cos θw,sw  =   sin θw. When f  =  ν we obtain the following contribution to the neutrino magnetic moment

[formula]

Finally, for the up-type fermions f one gets the following contribution to df

[formula]

and for the down-type fermions

[formula]

where

[formula]

We have discussed in this section how fermion moments are described by linear effective Lagrangians. We will now address our attention to describe the procedure to extract limits in this case, and leave the discussion of non-linear effective Lagrangians until section 4.

Bounds on the magnetic and electric moments

We have seen in the last section that the linear effective Lagrangian in Eq. ([\ref=Leff]) induces fermion moments to be added to the SM contributions. However, the new operators in the effective Lagrangian have other effects. The most interesting, from the phenomenological point of view, is the anomalous coupling of the Z boson to fermions

[formula]

These anomalous couplings would shift the partial widths [formula] from their predicted values in the Standard Model

[formula]

The agreement between experiment and the SM predictions implies limitations on the strength of the different a priori independent terms in the effective Lagrangian. We will not allow for unnatural cancellations of the effects produced by different operators, and thus we will consider one operator at a time.

We should emphasize that once we have selected one of the contributions to a particular fermionic width Γf, it is not enough to simply use the experimental result Γexpf to get our constraints. This is due to the well-known mt-dependence of the theoretical predictions of the SM, and to a less extent to the dependence on the Higgs mass MH. We choose to keep the mt-dependence of our results explicitily and allow MH to span the range 60 GeV to 1 TeV, with this "theoretical uncertainty" (and the theoretical uncertainty in the experimental value of αs) linearly summed to the experimental errors. It is quite common to combine theoretical and experimental errors in quadrature. Here, we adopt the more conservative point of view of adding the two types of uncertainties linearly.

For the theoretical SM predictions we borrow the results of Bardin et al. [\cite=BARDIN], that were kindly made available to us by M.Bilenky.

We use the LEP value MZ  =  91.187 GeV as input, as well as the current values of α and GF [\cite=LEP] [\cite=PDG]. The observables we use to constrain deviations from the Standard Model are:

1) the experimental LEP-I data [\cite=LEP]

[formula]

2) the W-mass determined from the ratio MW / MZ measured at p colliders and the LEP value for MZ [\cite=ALLITI_&_ABE]

[formula]

3) the ratio of inclusive neutral- to charged-currents neutrino cross sections on approximately isoscalar targets [\cite=ABRAMOWICZ_&_ALLABY]

[formula]

and

4) the CDF limit on the top quark mass [\cite=CDF]

[formula]

We now turn our attention to the explicit expressions for δΓf due to the novel effects we are considering. Starting with the operators OfB, we have that for each fermion f the relative width shift is

[formula]

where vf  =  Tf3  -  2  s2w  Qf and af  =  Tf3. The operators OfW induce the change

[formula]

In the CP-violating sector, the operators fB lead to

[formula]

while the type fW lead to

[formula]

As we have already discussed, the limits on the different parameters ε in Eqs. ([\ref=EPSfB],[\ref=EPSfW]) and ε̃ in Eqs. ([\ref=TILDE_EPSfB],[\ref=TILDE_EPSfW]) will depend sensitively on mt, since we have choosen to combine the weak dependence on MH linearly with the experimental uncertainties. The limits are obtained by comparing the experimental values of the observables in Eqs. ([\ref=OBS]-[\ref=MTOP]) with the predictions that we get when adding the SM results and the corrections previously discussed. Our results on εfB are presented in Fig. 1, and the ones on εfW in Fig. 2. The projection on the ε2 (or the m2t) axis corresponds to a single-variable 68%, or 1σ, confidence-level interval. These limits can be read from Figs. 1 and 2

[formula]

As expected from a comparison of Eqs. ([\ref=EPSfB]) and ([\ref=EPSfW]) the limits coming from the operators OfW are stronger than the ones coming from OfB. Introducing the limits on ε into Eqs. ([\ref=DELTA_a_fU],[\ref=DELTA_a_fD]) we get limits on the anomalous magnetic moments. Looking at this equation, we anticipate that the operators OfW will lead to the tightest bounds on δaf. We only quote here these strongest limits (we use mu = 5 MeV,md = 10 MeV,mc = 1.5 GeV,ms = 200 MeV,mb = 5.0 GeV)

[formula]

We have skipped the limits on δae,δaμ since the direct measurements make our limits completely useless. The constraints on κν for νe and νμ coming from Red Giant observations [\cite=RAFFELT] also make our corresponding limits far away from being competitive.

We follow an identical procedure to constrain ε̃fB and ε̃fW. It turns out that the limits on ε̃fB are the same than the ones on εfB, and similarly the ε̃fW and εfW are identical. Again we only quote our best limits on the electric dipole moments (in e-cm)

[formula]

Here we have skipped the limits on δde,δdμ,δdu and δdd since the experimental bounds on them are much stronger. Again Red Giant evolution analysis imply much tighter limits for νe and νμ than our corresponding results.

We finally turn our attention to a comparison of our limits with other results in the literature. We present the comparison in Table [\ref=Table_1] for the anomalous magnetic moment and in Table [\ref=Table_2] for the electric dipole moment. We improve previous limits for aτ,au,ad,ac,as,ab,dτ,dντ. Bounds on the tau-lepton moments following the approach presented in this section were calculated in Ref. [\cite=REM].

Non-linear effective Lagrangian approach

In section 2 we discussed the case where we extend a linearly realized Standard Model. However, there are models -as the technicolor ones- that do not fit into the linear framework. The assumptions of avoiding the presence of the physical scalar sector, or of sending its mass to infinity do not commute with the linear expansion since Φ is no longer there to construct gauge-invariant effective operators. In this case, Λ  ~  4πv, and it is appropriate to use a non-linear or chiral realization of the Standard Model, and to extend it using non-linear effective Lagrangians. These were discussed in detail back in 1980 in [\cite=CHIRAL] and have been recently reviewed in [\cite=FERUGLIO].

We would like to investigate the consequences of adopting the chiral approach for the fermion moments. Let us start with the magnetic moment of the up and down quarks. By working this specific example we will be able to understand the general pattern.

We add a piece to the SM Lagrangian that contains vertices corresponding to au and ad. The leading terms in the chiral expansion are given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

M is the mass matrix

[formula]

and Σ contains the would-be Goldstone bosons

[formula]

The contributions to the magnetic dipole moment coming from Leff will contain the coefficients β and β' in Eq. ([\ref=NlLeff]). In the unitary gauge, these contributions can be put in the form of those we found in the linear case, Eqs. ([\ref=DELTA_a_fU],[\ref=DELTA_a_fD],[\ref=DELTA_a_nu],[\ref=DELTA_d_fU],[\ref=DELTA_d_fD]), provided we identify

[formula]

For our phenomenological purposes, it is interesting to notice that with the very same identifications made in the last equation, our Eq. ([\ref=lefftot]) containing the anomalous couplings to the Z-boson is valid. We can use now the fact, shown in the last section, that our constrains on the anomalous magnetic moment from LEP-1 data do not depend on the definitions of the parameters ε. This is also true in the case of the dipole electric moments, where we should use the effective Lagrangian

[formula]

Here we have worked out the example of the magnetic moments of the u and d quarks. It is clear that it can be easily extended to the magnetic and electric moments of all fermions. Notice also that our final limits do not depend on the mass appearing in the mass matrix in Eq. ([\ref=mass]).

Our conclusion is that our limits on fermion magnetic and electric moments derived in a linear effective Lagrangian approach hold true when using the chiral expansion of the non-linear effective Lagrangian.

Conclusions

Physics beyond the Standard Model of the electroweak interactions can be described in a general way using effective Lagrangians. We use this approach to study magnetic and electric moments of the fermions. We find that any contribution to these moments inevitably induces anomalous couplings of the Z-boson to fermions.

The LEP-I data severely constrains these anomalous couplings, and the constraints in turn set stringent bounds on the magnetic and electric moments. Some of the bounds represent an improvement on previously derived limits on fermion moments.

We have studied both the linear and non-linear realizations of effective Lagrangians and have shown that both lead to the same numerical limits on moments.
