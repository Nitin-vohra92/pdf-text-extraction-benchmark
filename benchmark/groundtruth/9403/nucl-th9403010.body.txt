By colliding ultrarelativistic ions, one achieves presently energy densities close to the critical value, concerning the formation of a quark-gluon-plasma. This indicates the importance of fluctuations and the necessity to go beyond the investigation of average events. Therefore, we introduce a percolation approach to model the final stage (τ  >  1 fm/c) of ion-ion collisions, the initial stage being treated by well-established methods, based on strings and Pomerons. The percolation approach amounts to finding high density domains, and treating them as quark-matter droplets. In this way, we have a realistic, microscopic, and Monte-Carlo based model which allows for the formation of quark matter. We find that even at SPS energies large quark-matter droplets are formed - at a low rate though. In other words: large quark-matter droplets are formed due to geometrical fluctuation, but not in the average event.

Based on extrapolations of present knowledge, one expects that at future ion-ion colliders (RHIC, LHC) very high energy densities will be achieved, high enough to support the formation of a new state of matter consisting of deconfined quarks and gluons. At present days accelerators for ultrarelativistic ions (SPS, AGS), operating at lower energies, the situation is less clear, because one reaches energy densities just around the critical value. In such a situation, fluctuations become crucial, and it is no longer useful to discuss "average . Therefore, we investigate the formation of quark-gluon-matter droplets due to geometrical fluctuations. This amounts to finding domains of high energy density - higher than the average. For this purpose, we introduce a percolation approach for the final stage, τ  >  1 fm/c, of nucleus-nucleus collisions, the initial stage being treated by the VENUS string model [\cite=wer].

Straightforward extrapolations of models for (soft) hadron-hadron scattering turned out to be quite successful for hadron-nucleus as well as for nucleus-nucleus scattering. This is, however, only true for very basic observables like the pion multiplicity or the transverse energy. The investigation of rare processes (like Λ̄ production) showed the limitations of the "straightforward extrapolations" and the necessity to go beyond. The percolation approach to be discussed later is such a step beyond, other mechanisms have been proposed like a hadronic cascade [\cite=ran] [\cite=ton] [\cite=sor] or string fusion [\cite=and] [\cite=paj] [\cite=sor92]. The percolation appraoch is the first realistic, microscopic, and Monte-Carlo based model to allow for the formation of quark matter.

Let us first discuss the basic ideas of the percolation approach in a schematic way, the details and, in particular, the appropriate relativistic formulation will be given later. Consider a snapshot at some fixed time τ. This time shold be large enough (>  1 fm/c), so that the "initial stage" interactions occuring in the nucleus-nucleus overlap zone are finished. At the given time τ, we consider the locations (in R3) of all particles produced in the initial stage. There are, by chance, regions with high (energy) density and such with low density. To be quantitative, we introduce a "critical energy density" ε0, and look for domains with ε  >  ε0. This can be done for example by using a grid and checking the density per cell. The high density domains, the connected regions with ε  >  ε0, are referred to as quark matter clusters (or droplets). Once they have been formed, these clusters are treated macroscopically, characterized by a distribution function for energy density [formula], momentum [formula], and flavour [formula], with i referring to cluster i. There are no constituents explicitly kept track of, and there is no memory referring to the production process.

Instead of using a grid, we will use a different but equivalent method: we assign a "critical volume" V0 to all particles - again at given time τ. Domains of high energy density correspond to overlapping volumes (see fig. [\ref=f2]). So the task here is to find connected objects with at least pairwise overlap of individual volumes (in fig. [\ref=f2], we find four such objects). These objects are now considered as quark matter clusters (or droplets). It should be noted that the "critical volume" V0 is not the usual volume 4πR3h / 3 of a hadron, it is rather defined by the requirement that if hadronic matter is compressed beyond V0 per hadron, the individual hadrons cease to exist and quark matter is formed. So V0 is less than 4πR3h / 3. Rather than the critical volume V0, we usually use the critical energy density

[formula]

with mh being (mπ + mρ) / 2. This critical energy density ε0 (or equivalently V0) is the crucial parameter of our approach. We will investigate properties of the system as a function of ε0, and based on that we will try to find the "realistic value" of ε0.

For the first stage we use the independent string model, to be more precise the basic VENUS model without final state interactions [\cite=wer]. The elementary elastic interaction is Pomeron exchange, inelastic scattering and in particular particle production is treated via the optical theorem and by using the AGK cutting rules. An elementary inelastic process is then represented by a "cut Pomeron", which amounts to colour exchange and the creation of two strings. In this formalism, by using Carlo methods, one can determine projectile and target nucleons which interact with each other, and how many colour exchanges occur per NN interaction. In fig. [\ref=f3], we show a typical event: we consider a projection to the t-z plane, nucleon trajectories are represented by straight lines, interactions are represented by dots. Some nucleons interact (participants), some survive the interaction zone (spectators). Each dot, representing interaction, is a point of string formation, or, in other words, the origin of a string evolution. What happens after a string formation point? We use the standard procedure of classical relativistic string dynamics and decays [\cite=wer]. In fig. [\ref=f4] a typical example of the space-time evolution is shown. The upper rectangles represent produced particles (hadrons and resonances), the arrows indicate particle trajectories. Remarkable is the strict ordering of the directions, being a consequence of the covariant string breaking mechanism.

Being able to construct in a first stage, event by event, particle trajectories defined by their origins in space and the four-momenta, we can proceed to stage two, the analysis of energy densities and cluster formation at fixed time. The question is, what we mean by fixed time, which frame we are using. This is going to be discussed in the following.

Crucial for the whole approach is a correlation between the rapidity

[formula]

and the space-time rapidity

[formula]

with E and pz being energy and longitudinal momentum of a particle, t being the time, and z being the longitudinal coordinate. The variable ζ is like an angle, constant ζ are straight lines through the origin in the t-z plane. In order to investigate a correlation between y and ζ, we perform a VENUS simulation for central S+  S collisions at 200 GeV. We measure, for different times, the average rapidity [formula] of produced particles in small cells at [formula], as a function of z. We average over many events. We observe, as shown in ref. [\cite=wer91], to a very good accuracy

[formula]

with deviations only around z  ≈  t, due to the finite size of the nuclei. We may parametrize our findings as

[formula]

with the boundaries zP and zT given as

[formula]

with α  <  1, and with

[formula]

So we have an "inner region" with Bjorken-type behaviour   =  ζ, where all the particle momenta point back to the origin, and an "outer region" with parallel velocity vectors. Correspondingly, the dotted line in fig. [\ref=f8], a hyperbola in the inner region and the tangents at zP and zT, represent equal proper time τ (on the average). In this way, obviously, also an average comoving frame is defined. The hypersurface defined by the hyperbola/tangents (dotted line) together with arbitrary [formula] is called τ-hypersurface. We are now in a position to specify the frame for interactions: we investigate densities (or overlap) at constant τ, which means on τ-hypersurfaces.

Having specified the frame and correspondingly the time coordinate τ, we have to introduce a useful longitudinal coordinate. We use the "proper length"

[formula]

with an integration at constant τ, and with dz* being a longitudinal length in the average comoving frame defined by the τ-hypersurface. So we have

[formula]

with ζ  =  ζ(t,z) = 0.5   ln (t + z) / (t - z) in the inner region and ζ  =  ζT / P in the outer region. In the inner region we have the simple relation

[formula]

between the length s and the "angle" ζ.

To specify the geometrical properties of particles or clusters, we use the variables τ, s, and [formula]. At given τ, a particle or cluster is considered as cylinder in s,rx,ry space, with the axis along the s-axis. The object is characterized by a lower and upper value of s, s1 and s2, and a transverse radius [formula]. We also use

[formula]

and

[formula]

We are now in a shape to construct high density domains, to be considered as quark matter cluster. As discussed above, these domains are constructed, as in percolation models, by investigating geometrical overlaps of individual objects. There are two types of objects: initially, we have only hadrons and resonances, later also clusters contribute, which have been formed earlier. In any case, at a given time τ, the objects are considered cylindric in (s,rx,ry)-space. Connected overlapping objects in this space define clusters. Such a cluster has in general a very irregular shape, which is "smoothened" in the sense that this complicated shape is replaced by a cylinder of the same volume, the same length s2 - s1, and the same center s̄.

Starting at some initial time τ0 (presently 1 fm/c), we step through time as τi + 1  =  τi  +  δτ, constructing clusters at each time τi. For the time evolution of clusters, we presently assume purely longitudinal expansion,

[formula]

Crucial for our percolation approach is the initialization, i.e., the volume V0 assigned to the hadrons and resonances. The "critical" volume V0, or equivalently the "critical" energy density ε0: = mh / V0, is the percolation parameter. To say it again, the volume V0 is not the usual nucleon volume - it is the minimum volume per particle for hadronic matter to exist. In order to avoid confusion we therefore prefer to use the critical energy density ε0 as percolation parameter. There are two things we are going to do: first, we will investigate, for a given reaction, the dynamics as a function of ε0, then we will try to find a "realistic" value of ε0 (denoted as ε*0), by comparing with data.

The last and most difficult topic to be discussed is the hadronization. The power of our percolation approach is that any hadronization scheme can be plugged into our approach and tested in a very detailed fashion. This is what we plan for the future. Currently, we present a very simple scenario, which can be implemented quite easily. Since our cluster expands, the energy density decreases, and drops at some stage below ε0. Per definition, we hadronize the cluster at this point instantaneously. Since the clusters turn out to have essentially longitudinal shape ([formula]), we proceed as follows. The cluster is cut into many short pieces in s, all of them having the same mass m with the requirement of m being around some parameter mseg. The small clusters then decay isotropically according to phase space [\cite=aic]. So this is essentially the decay of many fireballs at different rapidities.

Our approach is, apart from the relativistic expansion, a typical percolation problem. In general, one investigates the value for an order parameter P as a function of the percolation parameter. For infinite systems, one finds second order phase transitions, with P being zero in one phase and nonzero in the other. But also for finite systems a characteristic behaviour survives. In our case, we expect the following: for large values of the percolation parameter ε0 (or small V0), we expect the distribution of cluster sizes being peaked at small sizes, dropping very fast. For small ε0 (large V0), it is most likely to find large clusters, so the distribution will peak at large sizes. There should be a transition region, around some "percolation transition value" εPT0, with large fluctuations in cluster sizes. The question is what is the value of εPT0, in particular related to the realistic value ε*0 (to be determined).

In fig. [\ref=f11], we show the results. We plot the distribution of cluster volumes V for different values of the critical energy density (CED) ε0. The numbers are not normalized, we show the number of clusters per volume bin ΔV, found in 1200 simulations; the bin sizes for the three distributions are, from top to bottom: ΔV=10 fm3, 20 fm3, 60 fm3. From the grey-scales, we can also read off how the clusters are distributed in energy density. We show only results for τ = 2 fm/c, since volumes and energy densities turn out to scale in a trivial manner, as V  ~  τ and ε  ~  τ- 1, so the distributions for different τ look similar up to a scale transformation.

We observe exactly what we expected: for ε0 = 1 GeV/fm3, the distribution peaks at small values of V, dropping very fast with increasing volume V. Reducing the CED to 0.50 GeV/fm3, the distribution gets wider, roughly by a factor of two. Although, as for ε0 = 1 GeV/fm3, very small clusters are favoured, the fluctuations are considerably larger. Reducing ε0 further to 0.15 GeV/fm3 ([formula] nuclear matter density), we observe a drastic change in the distribution, a maximum at large values of V emerged. It is possible to introduce "a maximum volume" Vmax, which is for a longitudinal expansion given as

[formula]

with the rapidity range Δy and the transverse area [formula]. For central S+  S at 200 GeV, we obtain for τ = 2 fm/c:

[formula]

For ε0 = 0.15 GeV/fm3, the tail of the V-distribution almost reaches out to this value, and therefore this value of ε0 is close to the value εPT0 for the percolation transition (if the probability P for Vmax to be observed is the order parameter).

It is difficult and not yet conclusive to find a "realistic" value ε*0 for ε0. The best value at present is ε*0 = 1 GeV/fm3, which provides good results concerning proton, pion, and strange particle yields for S+  S and S+  Ag scattering. We expect further confirmation (or not) from investigating particle correlations, because the value of ε0 affects quite strongly "source radii" deduced from correlation functions. Corresponding work is under progress.

Taking our best value, ε*0 = 1 GeV/fm3, the upper plot of fig. [\ref=f11] represents the realistic world (the lower plots are just mathematical exercise). Although here it is most likely to produce just small clusters (mainly hadrons and resonances), there is nevertheless a reasonable probability to form big clusters, with our statistics of 1200 simulations up to 65 fm3. The question is, whether such "miniplasmas" can be "isolated" in event-by-event experiments.

To summarize, we have introduced a percolation approach for the final stage (τ  >  1 fm/c) of ultrarelavistic energies. This approach allows for the formation of quark matter clusters in case of high energy densities. We analyzed the distribution of cluster sizes for central S+  S collisions at SPS energies (200 GeV). Although, for a realistic value of our percolation parameter ε0, it is most likely to form only small clusters (mainly hadrons and resonances), there is a reasonable rate to form large clusters. So at SPS energies, it is crucial not to investigate average events, but to pick out events with large clusters, which occur due to geometrical fluctuations.
