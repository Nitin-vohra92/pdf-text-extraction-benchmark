ABSTRACT

We give a series of integrable top equations associated with the projective geometry over Z2 as a (2n - 1)-dimensional generalisation of the 3D Euler top equations. The general solution of the (2n - 1)D top is shown to be given by an integration over a Riemann surface with genus (2n - 1 - 1)2.

[formula]D top equations

Recently we discovered an apparently new integrable set of evolution equations in seven dimensions, which are an analogue of the well-known 3D Euler top [\cite=dbf][\cite=tu]. The 7D top arises from the dimensional reduction of the 8D Spin(7) invariant self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations in [\cite=cdfn], just as the 3D top comes from the reduction of the 4D SDYM to differential equations depending only upon one variable. The integrability of the 3D top is ensured by the existence of the Lax formulation of the 4D SDYM [\cite=ac], while there is no such first order structure behind the 8D SDYM [\cite=rsw]. Nevertheless the 7D top has been shown to have sufficient conserved quantities to permit full integrability [\cite=dbf] and its general solution is given by a non-hyperelliptic differential equation corresponding to a Riemann surface with genus 9 [\cite=tu].

The derivation of the top equations from the SDYM shows their connection with the existence of the division algebras, the 3D system arising from the quaternionic algebra, the 7D one from the octonions, which seems to suggest that no further integrable top system in more than seven dimensions should exist. In this note, however, we demonstrate that a generalisation of our previous results to general 2n - 1 dimensions is possible and is associated rather with the n-dimensional projective space over Z2.

We take the projective space Z2Pn - 1 with homogeneous coordinates [formula], where zi is either 0,1 and calculations are performed in arithmetic mod 2. The space Z2Pn - 1 consists of a finite number of points ei [formula] with the multiplication operation eiej defined by the sum of their associated coordinates.

For the 3D (n = 2) case, we have three points,

[formula]

with the multiplication rule,

[formula]

where εijk is the structure constant of the su(2) (quaternion) algebra. Using this structure constant, we obtain the 3D Euler top equations with variables (ω1(t),ω2(t),ω3(t)),

[formula]

In the 7D (n = 3) case, we have seven points,

[formula]

with the relation

[formula]

where cijk is equal to a realization of the totally anti-symmetric structure constant appearing in the Cayley (octonion) algebra,

[formula]

The relation ([\ref=oct2]) can be read off from the diagram in Fig.1, the seven-point plane with 7 points and 7 lines; 3 points lie on each line and 3 lines pass through each point. Replacing εijk in ([\ref=euler]) by the constant cijk, we obtain the set of seven equations for a 7D top [\cite=dbf][\cite=tu],

[formula]

In a similar fashion to the above 3D and 7D cases, we can obtain 2n - 1 equations for a (2n - 1)D top. The structure of the higher-dimensional tops can be understood from the (2n - 1)-point hyperplane diagram, which is an extension of the seven-point plane and consists of 2n - 1 points and 2n - 1 (2n - 1 - 1)-point hyperplanes, where 2n - 1 - 1 points lie on each (2n - 1 - 1)-point plane and 2n - 1 - 1 (2n - 1 - 1)-point hyperplanes pass through each point.

For example, in the 15D (n = 4) case with an appropriate labelling of 15 points in Z2P3, we have a 15-point tetrahedral space containing the following 15 7-point planes assigned by 7 points in them,

[formula]

where the p-th element in each of the above 15 brackets is placed on the point p in Fig.1. The form of the 15D top equations derived from the 15 point-hyperplane is

General solution of the [formula]D top

Integrability

To show the integrability of the (2n - 1)D top and its general solution, it is convenient to work with a set of 2n - 1 variables ai, instead of the ωi's. The rule to define the ai's is to pick up 2n - 1 sets of 2n - 1 ωi's which do not lie on a (2n - 1 - 1)-point subplane in the (2n - 1)-point hyperplane and to assign ai to the sum of all 2n - 1 ωi's in each of the 2n - 1 sets. For example, in the 3D case,

[formula]

and in the 7D case,

[formula]

Similarly, 15 variables ai in the 15D top can be easily read off from the 15-point hyperplane defined in (8).

Using the variables ai, the (2n - 1)D top equations are re-expressed as

[formula]

and the equations of motion for the difference of the ai's are

[formula]

We introduce the quantity W with the constants ρi and χij,

[formula]

The condition [formula] leads us to (2n - 1)(2n - 1 - 1) conserved quantities Nij,

[formula]

Although the Nij are not independent, they are sufficient to construct a basis of 2n - 2 independent conserved quantities, thus guaranteeing the integrability of the (2n - 1)D top. Specifically, all the Nij can be expressed in terms of N1j [formula] through the relation

[formula]

which means that any conserved quantities in the system can be constructed from these 2n - 2 quantities N1j. In particular it is possible to define 2n - 1 polynomial conserved quantities γi from Nij as

[formula]

where (jp,kp), [formula] lie on the respective 2n - 1 - 1 lines through the point i. The polynomials γi are of order 2n - 1. There is, of course, one functional relationship connecting these 2n - 1 expressions.

Summing over the index i of Nij in ([\ref=nij]), we see that all aj are expressed in terms of two variables T and U, with the constants [formula],

[formula]

Note that the variables T and U are symmetric under any permutation of ai's. Substituting the expression of ai's into the definition of T in ([\ref=nij]), we have the following relation between T and U,

[formula]

From ([\ref=atu]) and ([\ref=tu]), we see that all variables are expressible in terms of one variable, which demonstrates that the system of the (2n - 1)D top is integrable. The explicit expression for the quadrature whose evaluation solves the top is given in the next subsection.

General solution

The time derivatives of T and U are derived from the equations of motion ([\ref=eqa]),

[formula]

We introduce a variable R(t)  =  T(t)  U(t), whose time derivative is given as

[formula]

Substituting R  =  T  U into ([\ref=tu]) and ([\ref=atu]), we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using ([\ref=rt]) and ([\ref=trm]), we obtain a first-order equation for R(t),

[formula]

which is non-hyperelliptic except for the 3D (n = 2) case. The integral associated with this equation can be shown to correspond to a Riemann surface with genus g = (2n - 1 - 1)2; the order 1 / 2n - 1 in the RHS of ([\ref=Req]) means that we need 2n - 1 complex surfaces, each of which has 2n - 1 cuts since the order of R is 2n - 1 inside the bracket of the RHS.

Further generalisations

It would be natural to expect that the examples of this note could be further generalised to the discussion of evolution equations for [formula] variables, corresponding to tops based upon the space ZkPn - 1. Despite many efforts, we have as yet been unable to demonstrate a set of integrable equations for integral k > 2 except for the case where n = 2 and there are k + 1 points lying on a line. Then one possibility for a set of integrable evolution equations is [\cite=dbf2]

[formula]

These equations are reduced to a hyperelliptic differential equation for a g = k - 1 Riemann surface. It would be surprising if there is no elegant integrable generalisation of these or similar evolution equations.
