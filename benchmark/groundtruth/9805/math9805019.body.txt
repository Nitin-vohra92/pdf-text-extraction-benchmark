Introduction

It is well known that Poisson manifolds play important role in Hamiltonian mechanics and integrability [\cite=o]. The suitable analytic framework for these developments is usually referred as the Poisson calculus [\cite=vais]. The Poisson structure on manifold M endows the space of functions C∞(M) by the structure of Lie algebra (via Poisson bracket), which respects the usual structure of commutative algebra on C∞(M), i.e. the Leibnitz rule for the Poisson bracket takes place. Having rejected the Leibnitz rule, we may obtain more general structures of Lie algebra on C∞(M), which are referred as local Lie algebras [\cite=kir]. The manifolds, equipped with such structures, are usually called Jacobi manifolds. Namely, following Lichnerowicz [\cite=lic], we may define Jacobi manifold as follows

Let M be the manifold, on which are defined a skew-symmetric 2-tensor P and a vector a, which satisfy

[formula]

Then the triple (M,P,a) is called Jacobi manifold.

Here

The main result

The straightforward computation shows that the following assertion holds true:

Let (P,a) be Jacobi tensor on M and φ be an arbirtary function from the space C∞(M). Then

[formula]

is Jacobi tensor, compatible with (P,a), and the map

[formula]

is an isomorhism of local Lie algebras.

Here i(P)dφ stands for the vector with the components Pij(x)∂φ  /  ∂xj.

As we see, the above isomorphism is constructed by means of the analog of the well known gauge transformation in physics, f  ↦  f exp (iχ), with setting χ  =  iφ, where [formula].

Thus, the Jacobi tensors (P,a) and (P̃,ã) are equivalent and differ only by the "gauge" φ.

However, the compatibility of these Jacobi tensors allows one to proceed in almost standard manner and try to define bi-Hamiltonian systems on the Jacobi manifold in the following evident way:

Let H∈C∞(M) be the Hamiltonian. Let us consider the corresponding equations of motion

[formula]

where we fix explicitly the Jacobi tensor, which participates in the definition of Jacobi bracket.

As we know, the Jacobi tensor (P̃,ã) is compatible with (P,a). Let us fix some non-constant function φ in ([\ref=new]). Then, if there exists the function H1∈C∞(M) such that

[formula]

the system ([\ref=em1]) is bi-Hamiltonian, and one may construct the set of its integrals Ik (which will be in involution with respect to both brackets by construction [\cite=o]) in the standard way from the equation

[formula]

Two first terms in the sequence of Ik's are I0 = H and I1  =  H1.

Thus, if for any [formula] (in principle, the case k0  =    ∞   is not excluded) there exists the solution Ik of ([\ref=int]), and among Ik, [formula] one may choose a sufficient number of functionally independent ones, the system ([\ref=em1]) will be completely integrable in Liouville's sense.

Discussion

We would like to note that our approach is quite different from the usual scheme of proving the complete integrability in bi-Hamiltonian formalism, where the key problem was the construction of the Poisson structure, compatible with initial one. The key point is that we replace Poisson structure on manifold by more general Jacobi structure. Then Theorem 1 always guarantees the existence of the infinite set of Jacobi structures, compatible with initial one. Hence, we have a very simple sufficient condition for the Hamiltonian system ([\ref=em1]) to be bi-Hamiltonian and completely integrable: if for some non-constant function φ in ([\ref=new]) one is able to find the sufficient number of functionally independent solutions of ([\ref=int]) for different k, the system ([\ref=em1]) will be completely integrable in Liouville's sense, as it was already mentioned above.

The problem of existence of solutions of ([\ref=int]) is now under study and will be the subject of our following publications.

I would like to thank Dr. Roman G. Smirnov for fruitful discussions about compatible Jacobi tensors and related topics.
