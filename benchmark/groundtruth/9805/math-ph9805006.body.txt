Introduction

The eigenvalue problem arises in a variety of different branches of mathematical physics. For instance, it is well-known that quantum systems reach stationary states that are the eigenvectors of a suitable linear operator defined throughout a complex vector space representing the physical quantum states.

In the infinite dimensional case real and complex analytical methods have been developed to compute the eigenvalues of a linear operator. We mention, for instance, global variational methods, which consist of investigating stationary levels of a suitable energy functional, and local perturbative methods by means of complex analytic continuation.

On the other hand, if the underlying vector space is finite dimensional the eigenvalue problem becomes an algebraically well-posed problem by means of the characteristic polynomial. It is exactly this feature that justifies the algebraic approach in this work. Following this general device, the algebraic environment is set by the complex number field. After working out a few tools, the most important of these being Newton's identities, and setting very fundamental concepts and basic results in complex linear algebra, we succeed in achieving the mathematical core of this work: a recursive algorithm to compute the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial as algebraic functions in the traces of the successive powers of the linear operator.

With the aid of Cayley-Hamilton's theorem the trace formulas already obtained provide an operator-valued null identity for each finite dimension of the underlying vector space. As a by-product it sheds light on the algebraic structure of the associative algebra of complex linear operators. The computational skill just attained is enough to yield an operator-valued polynomial with rational coefficients for the finite-dimensional resolvent kernel, which improves a known result by revealing its rational dependence with respect to the spectral variable, as well as with respect to the linear operator.

In the context of general relativity, the 4-dimensional characteristic formula endows a polynomial expression for the volume scalar density. Furthermore, the 4-dimensional resolvent formula yields a tensor-valued third-degree polynomial for the inverse metric, thus avoiding the computacional and formal drawbacks of the Neumann series.

Newton's identities

The fundamental theorem of algebra [\cite=algebra] together with Euclid's division algorithm imply algebraic closureness [\cite=Lang] of the complex number field; this basic result is encompassed without proof by

If [formula] is a polynomial with complex coefficients   Dk then there exist complex numbers [formula], called roots of   p, such that [formula].

As a consequence of the identity principle, the following relations between coefficients and roots hold:

[formula]

The right-hand side of ([\ref=lambda]) defines the elementary symmetric functions [\cite=symmetric] in the variables [formula]. Next to them, the most important symmetric functions are the sums of like powers:

[formula]

Dk and   Tk, besides being symmetric, are homogeneous functions of degree k in the variables [formula]. We shall derive a set of recursive relations connecting   D's and   T's by which the   λ's are eliminated from ([\ref=lambda]) and ([\ref=Tk]).

To pursuit this goal we need two lemmas. The first one is an improved version of the remainder theorem.

If [formula] is a polynomial with complex coefficients   Dk and   λ is a complex number then

[formula]

Proof: By induction on the degree. For n=1,   p(z) - p(λ) = (z + D1) - (λ + D1) = z - λ. For generic n,   p(z) - p(λ) =

[formula]

From the inductive hypothesis the last expression reads

[formula]

The second lemma is a contribution of differential calculus to algebra.

If [formula] are the complex roots of the nth-degree polynomial   p and   p' is its derivative polynomial, then

[formula]

Proof: From [formula],  it follows

[formula]

Thus, we are able to get

If [formula]  are the complex roots of the polynomial [formula]  with complex coefficients   Dk and [formula]  then Proof: Propositions [\ref=seila] and [\ref=calculus] yield

[formula]

Equating coefficients we obtain

[formula]

from which follow the (n - 1) first relations to be shown. Since each   λk is a root of   p it verifies [formula]. The addition of these relations yields

[formula]

which is the remaining formula to be proved.

The trace formulas

The characteristic polynomial [\cite=charpoly] of a complex linear operator    in a finite dimensional complex vector space [formula] is defined by   p(z) =  det   (z  -  ), where    is the identity operator in [formula]. The degree of   p as a polynomial in the complex variable   z equals the dimension of [formula] as a complex vector space; its roots are called the characteristic values of    and the set of characteristic values is called the spectrum of   .

These definitions and properties lead to

The trace of a complex linear operator    equals the sum of its characteristic values counted with multiplicities. Proof: [formula]. By the matrix representation Tij of    we cast the left-hand side as [formula] terms of order ≤  n - 2. In the right-hand side we have [formula] terms of order ≤  n - 2. Equating coefficients we obtain

[formula]

The roots of unity in the complex field yield the following factorization lemma in the associative algebra of complex linear operators.

If    and    are commuting complex linear operators and [formula]  with k a positive integer, then

[formula]

Proof: As    and    commute we collect terms as

[formula]

where the complex numbers [formula]  are the coefficients of the polynomial [formula], since [formula]  for each [formula]. Therefore [formula]  and   dk =  - 1.

From the multiplicative and homogeneity properties of determinants we get

If [formula] are the characteristic values of the complex linear operator    then [formula] are the characteristic values of the linear operator   k.

Proof: For the particular case where    = w, proposition [\ref=Tpow] yields Thus [formula]

Collecting the former results we are ready to achieve the recursive formulas enclosed by

If [formula] is the characteristic polynomial of the complex linear operator    and   Tk  =    (k)  then Proof: It is a straightforward consequence of theorem [\ref=TNewton] together with propositions [\ref=trace] and [\ref=lambdak].

The key content of theorem [\ref=powtrace] shall be stood out by the trace formulas statement: the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a linear operator can be recursively computed as polynomial functions in the traces of its successive powers.

The trace formulas [formula]  for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are listed below for k up to 8.

[formula]

The characteristic formulas for dimensions up to four are written down:

[formula]

Null identities

The polynomial [formula] with complex coefficients   dk is said to annihilate the complex linear operator    if [formula], the identically null operator.

The knowledge of the principal ideal [\cite=annulet] of polynomials that annihilate a linear operator    is essential to attain computational skill in the associative algebra generated by   . To ensure this goal we state without proof one of the fundamental results in linear algebra.

The characteristic polynomial of a linear operator annihilates it.

Joining Cayley-Hamilton's theorem with trace formulas statement we conclude that for each finite dimension of the underlying vector space there is a fundamental null identity in the associative algebra of linear operators. For instance, in dimensions up to four, the characteristic formulas ([\ref=determinants]) yield the following null identities:

[formula]

The finite-dimensional resolvent kernel

The resolvent of a complex linear operator    is the operator-valued function    defined by [formula]. It is a well-known fact that    is an operator-valued analytic function outside the spectrum of   . We shall refine such a result showing that in the finite dimensional case    is an operator-valued rational function completely tied by a finite set of complex-valued rational functions, whose coefficients are exactly the trace formulas.

In this vein we need an improved version of the remainder theorem in the associative algebra of complex linear operators, whose content is the extension of proposition [\ref=seila] to operator-valued polynomials.

If [formula] is a polynomial with complex coefficients   Dk and    and    are commuting complex linear operators then

[formula]

Proof: By induction on the degree. For n = 1,    p() - p() = ( + D1) - ( + D1) =   -  . For generic n,    p() - p() =

[formula]

From the inductive hypothesis the last expression reads

[formula]

We are ready to achieve a rational formula for the resolvent kernel.

If [formula] is the characteristic polynomial of the complex linear operator    and   z is any complex number not belonging to the spectrum of    then

[formula]

Proof: It is enough to consider Cayley-Hamilton's theorem for the linear operator    and set    = z in proposition [\ref=remainder]; notice that in such case [formula]  for each [formula].

The joint content of theorem [\ref=resolvent] and the trace formulas statement shall be pointed out as : for each finite dimension of the underlying vector space there is a fundamental rational formula for the resolvent kernel of a linear operator. For instance, in dimensions up to four, the trace formulas ([\ref=tformulas]) provide the following resolvent formulas:

[formula]

Applications to general relativity

In general relativity the fundamental physical object is an effective geometry, mathematically represented by a second-rank covariant tensor field [formula], defined throughout a suitable 4-dimensional manifold. In a local coordinate system [formula] the metric tensor can be written as [formula].

Investigations on general relativity are frequently carried out under the assumption that there exists some background geometry [formula]. The metric properties to be assumed on [formula] vary depending on the gravitational scenario. In order to perform calculations it suffices to set [formula] a Ricci-flat metric. However, to interpret the results as physically meaningful it is generally agreed that one should require [formula] to be a flat metric. Even this case is sometimes thought to be too broad, as some authors claim to set harmonic coordinates [\cite=Fock] or even cartesian coordinates [\cite=Landau]. We do not take into account here any suplementary conditions on the background geometry [formula].

The effective and background geometries are related by a tensor field [formula] by a connecting equation, the generally accepted form of which being [formula]. The scalar density [formula] associated with [formula] requires us to compute [formula]. This can be achieved by means of

If [formula] and the underlying manifold is 4-dimensional then

[formula]

Proof: From [formula] it follows that [formula]. Now it is enough to consider the 4-dimensional characteristic formula in ([\ref=determinants]) with z = 1 and  =  - ; notice that k = ( - )kk implies Tk = ( - )kHk.

The Levi-Civita connection associated with [formula] requires us to compute [formula]. The known explicit form is given by the Neumann series [\cite=Neumann] In local coordinates it reads where gμν and [formula] are well-defined by [formula].

Besides convergence requirements on the above series, we stress that such expression leads to technical difficulties when developing the Lagrangian variational formalism. These problems were already dealt with in the literature, the proposed solution being to modify the above form of the connecting equation [\cite=Grishchuk]. We show how to overcome such drawbacks by means of

If [formula] and the underlying manifold is 4-dimensional then Proof: From [formula] it follows that [formula]. Now it is enough to consider the 4-dimensional resolvent formula in ([\ref=upto4]) with z = 1 and  =  - ; notice that k = ( - )kk implies Tk = ( - )kHk.
