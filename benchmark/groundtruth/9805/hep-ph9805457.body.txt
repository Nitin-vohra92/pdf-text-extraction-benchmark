If supersymmetry (SUSY) is a real solution for gauge hierarchy problem, we should understand how SUSY is broken and why the SUSY Higgs mass is around the SUSY breaking scale, which is much less than the grand unified scale or the Planck scale. One of the most interesting scenarios of understanding the SUSY breaking is gauge mediated SUSY breaking scenario [\cite=dine]. In the last few years, using the recent development on SUSY gauge theories [\cite=seiberg] [\cite=izawa], various dynamical SUSY breaking models are examined [\cite=dine] [\cite=murayama-model] [\cite=gmsb] [\cite=murayama] [\cite=giudice2]. Unfortunately, in the gauge mediated SUSY breaking scenario, we have not understood well why the SUSY Higgs term is around the SUSY breaking scale, though various attempts are considered [\cite=dine] [\cite=murayama] [\cite=mu]. One possible solution for the μ problem is to introduce the singlet field which is coupled with the Higgs fields, and to realize that the vacuum expectation value (VEV) which becomes the SUSY Higgs mass, is determined by the SUSY breaking parameters [\cite=dine]. However, it is dangerous because the radiative correction generally breaks the gauge hierarchy when the singlet field couples to the heavy fields [\cite=singlet].

On the point of SUSY grand unified theories (GUT) we should understand not only the mechanism of the doublet-triplet splitting [\cite=dt] but the consistency between GUT formalism and the solution of the μ problem. For example, the singlet field introduced for the μ problem is also coupled with the colored Higgs, which breaks gauge hierarchy.

In this paper, we examine a model in which SUSY and GUT gauge symmetry are simultaneously broken and the μ problem can be solved. To break SUSY and GUT gauge symmetry at the same time, it is natural that SUSY breaking is mediated by the massive vector multiplet (gauge messenger) [\cite=giudice].

The gauge messenger can work only when the F-term of the Higgs, which breaks a gauge symmetry, is non-zero, namely when the spectrum of the massive gauge multiplets deviates from the SUSY limit. Since the original gauge symmetry should include the standard gauge symmetry for inducing all needed soft SUSY breaking parameters, it is natural that GUT gauge symmetry is adopted as the original one.

We examine a following model with the gauge symmetry SU(5)G  ×  SU(3)H  ×  SU(2)H  ×  U(1)H in addition to the strong gauge group Sp(8) . The quantum numbers of introduced fields are

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are triplet and doublet superfields, respectively. We write SU(3)H  ×  SU(2)H  ×  U(1)H as SU(5)H in short . The index i = 1,2,3 is the generation number and the index a is 1 or 2. Here U(1)R is R-symmetry and the global symmetry [formula] has no anomaly under the strong Sp(8) gauge symmetry.

Although we adopt a non simple group for the GUT group, the ordinary matter is unified in the SU(5)G gauge group. The generic superpotential with the canonical dimension less than 6 is

[formula]

where Mφ is the same or smaller than a scale of new physics M. Here we shorten the description of the superpotential , for example, [formula] is divided to the SU(3)H part [formula] and the SU(2)H part [formula]. When the coupling of Sp(8) gauge group becomes large at the scale Λ, where SU(5)G  ×  SU(3)H  ×  SU(2)H  ×  U(1)H is weak, Sp(8) gauge theory is known to confine. Therefore the effective superpotential under the scale Λ can be written in terms of the composite fields

[formula]

as

[formula]

where Y is an auxiliary field. Then we can see that SUSY is dynamically broken from the first and second lines in eq.([\ref=1]). Under the constraint

[formula]

the F-term equations

[formula]

cannot be satisfied simultaneously, i.e., SUSY is spontaneously broken [\cite=izawa]. If we take [formula], then it is reasonable to take the vacuum

[formula]

Since we have no information on the Kähler potential of ΣQ, we only assume that the potential has a local minimum point

[formula]

under the constraints that all F-terms equal zero except FΣ . Here v1, v2, [formula] and [formula] are of the order of Λ.

The gauge group SU(5)G  ×  SU(3)H  ×  SU(2)H  ×  U(1)H is broken to the standard gauge group SU(3)C  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y by the above VEVs. One combination of ΣQ and Σ is the Higgs field eaten by the broken gauge freedom. (Since the VEV of the Σ field also breaks the U(1)R symmetry, R-axion also exists. Following the discussion of Bagger, Poppitz and Randall [\cite=r-axion], the R-axion can be massive because of the explicit breaking from some unknown mechanism which realizes the smallness of the cosmological constant.) It is known that since the F-term of the Higgs is non zero, the massive gauge multiplet can mediate the SUSY breaking to the ordinary matter. Note that the vector-like chiral multiplet does not work in this model at this stage. From the rough estimation of the SUSY breaking parameter

[formula]

λ  ~  10- 13 is required because the scale Λ should be taken as the GUT scale. As discussed later the smallness of the coupling λ is naturally realized.

Before the discussing the μ term, we study how doublet-triplet splitting can be realized in this model. The mass matrices of doublet (represented by D) and of triplet (represented by T) Higgs are

[formula]

where ε  =  Λ / M and "+  " and "-  " are the [formula] parity. The rank of the matrices is two for doublet Higgs and three for triplet Higgs, i.e., doublet-triplet splitting is realized. The light Higgs are almost

[formula]

Therefore the Yukawa coupling of the Up type quark with the Higgs field H is O(1), while the Yukawa coupling of the Down type quark is [formula]. Because of the asymptotically non-free gauge theory, the top Yukawa coupling is running to the value on the infra-red fixed point ~  1.25, therefore [formula] is ~  1.15 . The bottom Yukawa coupling at the low energy scale is about ten times larger than at the Λ scale. As discussed later ε is 10- (1  ~  2) and the hierarchy between the Up and Down type quark Yukawa is realized. Though it is obvious that the deformation is needed for more realistic Yukawa coupling, we do not discuss more on the Yukawa coupling.

Next we would like to discuss on the smallness of the coupling λ which determines the SUSY breaking scale and on the supersymmetric Higgs mass. The Higgs mass should be around the SUSY breaking scale, though it vanishes in this model by [formula] symmetry. If we would like to explain the μ problem, we should solve the above two problems at the same time. Is it possible? Yes, in order to explain the above two problems simultaneously, we change the assignment of the [formula] charge;

[formula]

The [formula] symmetry forbids

[formula]

on the other hand,

[formula]

is allowed . Consequently the F-term of the Σ becomes naturally small as

[formula]

As written later by gauge messenger , SUSY breaking parameters in visible sector

[formula]

are induced. Moreover,

[formula]

are allowed , which induce the supersymmetric Higgs (Hu and [formula]) mass term

[formula]

This can be a solution for the μ problem in this model when

[formula]

You should notice that this solution for the μ problem is realized only in the scenario that SUSY and GUT gauge symmetry is broken simultaneously. When we take the GUT scale 1015  ~  GeV  ≤  Λ  ≤  1016  ~  GeV and the supersymmetric Higgs mass μ  ~  100 ~ GeV, we should take [formula]. Of course, we think that this value may be easily changed by one order because of some ambiguities in the eqs. ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=5]) [\cite=nda]. Therefore we do not remove the possibility that M is regarded as the reduced Plank mass Mpl (~  1018  ~  GeV), though it is difficult that the gauge coupling does not diverge until the Plank scale in this model.

The Higgs mass mixing term (B-term) is often larger than the μ term in gauge mediated SUSY breaking models. But it is not the case in this model, because the origin of the μ term is not the same as the origin of the SUSY breaking. Actually, using the Spurion technique developed by Giudice and Rattazzi [\cite=giudice], we estimate the SUSY breaking parameters in the following case. The gauge group G  ×  H is broken to the L gauge group by [formula] with the relation α- 1L(Λ) = α- 1G(Λ) + α- 1H(Λ) and the F component [formula] is non zero. Then the gaugino mass Mi, the scalar soft mass square 2 of the matter field charged under G and L and the scalar two or three point vertex Ai are

[formula]

where bH,bG and bL are the coefficients of 1-loop β functions of H, G and L around the scale Λ, respectively, and CG and CL are the quadratic Casimir of the field in G and L (C = (N2 - 1) / 2N for an SU(N) fundamental field). From the above expression and the definition of Ai ([formula] where the Qi is the scalar component of the superfield Qi), the Higgs mixing is roughly estimated by B  ~  μMSB.

In the above expression the effect of Yukawa coupling is neglected. We must include the effect of top Yukawa coupling and discuss on the renormalization group analysis more carefully. We only comment that since the gauge theory is asymptotically non free, various parameters are enhanced and there are some parameter region where all the scalar soft mass squares except of the Hu become positive. We will study the detail in the next paper.

Finally, we should comment on the phenomenological constraints. The proton decay by dimension 5 operator [\cite=dim5] is strongly suppressed by the [formula] symmetry, though the proton decay by dimension 6 operators may be seen. Roughly speaking, the scale Λ should be larger than 1015 GeV. The gravitino mass [formula] should be smaller than 10 GeV for the phenomenological constraints from the flavour changing neutral currents ([formula] mixing, μ  →  eγ, etc.). If we take [formula], then Λ  ≤  1016 GeV. In this model if there is no CP phase in the VEV of the ΣQ and Σ fields, all CP violation phase except Kobayashi-Maskawa phase can be removed by field redefinition.

In summary, we construct a model in which the SUSY and the GUT gauge symmetry are dynamically broken simultaneously. The model is free for the doublet-triplet splitting problem and the μ problem.
