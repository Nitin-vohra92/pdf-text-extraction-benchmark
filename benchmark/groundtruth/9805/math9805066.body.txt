A Lower Bound for Partial List Colorings

Introduction

Let G be an n-vertex graph. Let each vertex of G be assigned a list of s colors. An s-list coloring of G is a proper vertex coloring in which each vertex is given a color from its list. We say G is s-choosable if G has an s-list coloring for each assignment of lists of size s to the vertices. The list-chromatic number of G, denoted by [formula], is the least s so that G is s-choosable. List coloring was introduced independently by Vizing [\cite=VizV76] and by Erd os, Rubin, and Taylor [\cite=ERT79].

Suppose each vertex of G is assigned a list of t colors ([formula]). It may not be possible to color every vertex from these lists; however, we can color a subset of the vertices. Albertson, Grossman, and Haas [\cite=AGH98] ask how many vertices can be colored. Letting [formula] range over all assignments of lists of size t to the vertices of G, we define

[formula]

If [formula], then [formula].

Conjecture [\ref=J:aghmain] clearly holds when t = 0 or [formula]. When t = 1, we note that G has an independent set of size at least [formula], where χ is the ordinary chromatic number. Since an independent set can always be colored from lists of size 1, we have [formula], and so the conjecture holds for t = 1. However, the conjecture remains open for [formula].

We will use a method similar to that of the proof of [\cite=AGH98] to prove a lower bound for [formula]. As a corollary, we show that [formula].

The Results

For integers s > t > 0, we define

[formula]

Then fs,t(0) > 0, fs,t(1) < 0, and [formula] for x > 0. Thus, the equation fs,t(x) = 0 has exactly one positive solution, which we denote by qs,t. Note that 0 < qs,t < 1.

If G is s-choosable, and s > t > 0, then [formula]. Furthermore, this inequality is strict if t > 1.

Let q = qs,t. Let each vertex of G be assigned a list of t colors, and let R be the union of these lists. Let u = s - t. We augment each list by adding new colors [formula]. There is an s-list coloring φ from the augmented lists. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  u, let Ii be the set of vertices given color πi; each Ii is an independent set. Let [formula], and let H = G - I. Thus, φ colors the vertices of H with colors in R.

We partition the set R randomly into classes [formula]; the class in which each color falls is chosen independently. We place a given color in class R0 with probability q and in each of the other classes with probability [formula].

Given a partition of R, we construct a proper t-list coloring of a subset of the vertex set of G as follows. The colors in R0 are used on the vertices of H. We color a vertex in H with its color in the coloring φ if that color appears in R0; otherwise, we leave the vertex uncolored. Thus, each vertex in H is colored with probability q.

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  u, the colors in Ri are used on Ii. We color a vertex in Ii if a color in its list appears in Ri; otherwise, we leave the vertex uncolored. A particular color fails to appear in Ri with probability

[formula]

Thus, each vertex of I is colored with probability

[formula]

since fs,t(q) = 0.

For some partition of R the number of colored vertices is at least the expected number. Since the above scheme results in each vertex being colored with probability q, we have [formula].

Now let t > 1. To see that the above inequality is strict, note that q is a root of the polynomial p(x): = utfs,t(x). All the coefficients of p(x) are integers; the leading coefficient of is - 1. By the Rational Roots Theorem, every rational root of p(x) is an integer. Since 0 < q < 1, we conclude that q is irrational, and so [formula].

Albertson et al. showed [\cite=AGH98] that [formula] if [formula]. Theorem [\ref=T:lowerbd] allows us to improve on this. Since [formula], we have the following stronger result.

If [formula], then [formula].

The conjectured lower bound is greater still: [formula].

Thomassen [\cite=ThoC94] showed that every planar graph is 5-choosable. Thus, we can apply Theorem [\ref=T:lowerbd] to planar graphs. Albertson et al. [\cite=AGH98] estimate that their method could be used to show that [formula] for every planar graph. By definition, q5,4 is the positive root of 1 - x - x4: a bit more than 0.724. Thus, [formula] if [formula] and in particular for every planar graph.

Next we show that [formula] is at least [formula] of the conjectured lower bound.

If [formula], then [formula].

Corollary [\ref=C:nicelowerbd] follows from Theorem [\ref=T:lowerbd], the comments after Conjecture [\ref=J:aghmain], and the following lemma.

If s > t > 0, then [formula]

We first show that

[formula]

Recall that fs,t(qs,t) = 0, and that fs,t(x) is decreasing for x > 0. Thus, it suffices to show that fs,t(cv) > 0, where [formula] and [formula].

[formula]

We show that the last expression is positive. Note that both 1 - cv and [formula] are positive; let g(v) be the difference of the logarithms of these quantities.

[formula]

It suffices to show that g(v) > 0, for 0 < v < 1. Verification of this requires only the standard techniques of calculus and is omitted.

Now we show that

[formula]

Since fs,t(x) is decreasing for x > 0, it suffices to show that [formula].

[formula]

The techniques of the above proof can be used to prove a slightly better lower bound for qs,t. Numerical computations indicate that
