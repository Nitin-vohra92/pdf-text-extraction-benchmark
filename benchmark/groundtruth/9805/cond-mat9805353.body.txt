Critical percolation and lack of self-averaging in disordered models

Abstract - Lack of self-averaging originates in many disordered models from a fragmentation of the phase space where the sizes of the fragments remain sample-dependent in the thermodynamic limit. On the basis of new results in percolation theory, we give here an argument in favour of the conjecture that critical two dimensional percolation on the square lattice lacks of self-averaging. The purpose of this note is to discuss a possible relationship between the arising of non self-averaging effects in disordered models and the occurrence of a percolative phase transition. More precisely we conjecture as follows: in two dimensional bond percolation on the square lattice non self-averaging effects are present at the critical point [formula], whereas above and below the critical probability the model is shown to be self-averaging. We also suggest that the phenomenon underlying the lack of self-averaging in many well studied models is a percolation-like phase transition: whenever non self-averaging effects are present these systems should be in a critical percolative state. A crucial role for the justification of these asserts will be played by the recent progress in two dimensional percolation theory achieved by Aizenman [\cite=aizenman], Shchur and Kosyakov [\cite=shchur], and Cardy [\cite=cardy].

The appearance of non self-averaging effects in the low temperature phase has been the most interesting outcome of the replica approach to spin glasses [\cite=parisi]. It has later been recognized that such effects are present in a large class of even simpler models ranging from condensed matter theory to population biology [\cite=higgs], to dynamical systems' theory [\cite=derrida::rmm] and mathematics as well (see Ref. [\cite=derrida::overview] for a unifying review of some of them). In Derrida's words, in the low temperature spin glasses "phase space can be thought of as if it was decomposed into infinitely many pure states α, the weights of which remain sample dependent even in the thermodynamic limit" [\cite=derrida::overview]. This results in non vanishing sample-to-sample fluctuations of the weights Wα even in the thermodynamic limit, so that any no matter how large sample is never a good representative of the whole ensemble. Furthermore, one may find finite-weighted pure states in each sample, something which sounds strange since the condition [formula] must always be satisfied. The same holds for many other models. In some cases, the expression obtained for the fluctuations of the weights coincides with that obtained for spin glasses in particular limits (as pointed out in Ref. [\cite=derrida::overview]), so that, again citing Derrida, it looks like "the spin glass problem, at least in its mean field version, belongs to a larger class of problems, and it would be interesting to develop a more general theory" [\cite=derrida::overview] to treat them.

By now, the standard method to detect non self-averaging effects is that of studying the quantity

[formula]

It is possible to show (see Ref. [\cite=derrida::overview] for explicative applications) that if both the ensemble average 〈Y〉, and the variance (Y) = 〈Y2〉  -  〈Y〉2 of Y are non zero in the thermodynamic limit, so that the probability density Π(Y) remains "broad" when the system's size goes to infinity, then Y and consequently the weights Wα are non self-averaging. 〈Y〉 is the average of Y over all possible samples, that is over all possible realizations of disorder, represented by a number of quenched random variables.

Broken objects are perhaps the most intuitive and simplest models showing the same non self-averaging behaviour as spin glasses. Consider fragmenting a given object of size 1 into infinite pieces of sizes Wα according to a given breaking process. A sample corresponds to a specific rupture, hence to particular values of a set of quenched random variables on which the process depends. For some processes one finds that the sizes of the pieces lack of self-averaging, that is they remain sample dependent despite of the fact that the number of pieces is infinite and that [formula]. This is the case of Derrida and Flyvbjerg's randomly broken object [\cite=derrida::rbo], where the breaking process depends on an infinite number of quenched random variables. We have recently shown that such a complex procedure is not necessary for non self-averaging effects to appear. In a geometrically broken object [\cite=adm], where the breaking process depends on just one random variable p and the sizes of the pieces form a geometric sequence, the situation is seemingly less complicated than that of the randomly broken object, and yet the same non self-averaging effects are present.

Let us now turn to bond percolation and consider a subset of the two dimensional square lattice [formula] given by a square S(N) of N2 points, having N points on each side. Once the bonds have been assigned with the usual procedure, namely there is a bond between neighbouring lattice sites with probability p, the square is broken into clusters whose size is easily identifiable as the number of points forming them, and an isolated point is regarded as a cluster of size 1. The sizes normalized with the total number of points N2 are the weights Wα, where α is an index running from 1 to the number of clusters formed. Clearly for each way of assigning the bonds and of forming the clusters one has [formula]. From this viewpoint, percolation theory on S(N) studies an object (the square) broken into pieces (the clusters) according to the well known rule. The thermodynamic limit is immediately given by the N  →    ∞   limit, in which S(N)  →  L2. In this limit percolation theory on the two-dimensional lattice, providing us with bounds and estimates for the probability that a piece is of a certain size in a sample produced with acertain value of p, is recovered.

A first problem concerns the ensemble in which averages should be evaluated. We could surely introduce disorder by treating p as a random variable, namely producing percolation lattice samples with a value of p chosen from a probability density ρ(p) on the
