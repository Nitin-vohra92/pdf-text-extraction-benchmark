THE PHYSICS SPACE DIMENSION

3+1 SPACE-TIME

Let [formula] be the event, which can be expressed as: "The particle eA is detected in the space point [formula] at the time moment t" and [formula] - as:

"The particle eB is detected in the space point [formula] at the time moment t0".

Let [formula] be the probability density of the event A. That is

[formula]

equals to the probability to detect the particle eA in the space domain V at the time moment t.

Let [formula] be the conditional probability density of the event A for the event B. That is

[formula]

equals to the probability to detect the particle eA in the space domain V at the time moment t, if the particle eB is detected in the space point [formula] at the time moment t0.

In this case, if

[formula]

then the function [formula] is the interaction function for eA and eB. If [formula] = 1 then the particles eA and eB do not interact.

In the Quantum Theory a probability density equals to the quadrate of the state vector module. A fermion state vector is the 4-component complex vector. Hence, a fermion state vector has got 8 real components. Therefore, some conformity between such vectors and the octaves (the Cayley numbers) can be determined.

Let [formula] and [formula]. Here: Ψ and Ψc are the 4-component complex state vectors. And Ψ and Ψc are the octaves by this conformity.

Because the Cayley algebra is the division algebra, then the octave φ exists, for which: [formula] (here [formula] is the symbol of the algebra Cayley product).

Because the Cayley algebra is the normalized algebra, then [formula].

Therefore, all fermion interactions can be expressed by the octaves in the 3 + 1 space-time.

μ+1 SPACE-TIME

Let us consider the probability density [formula] for some point-event [formula] in the μ + 1 space-time. That is

[formula]

is the probability for A to happen in the space domain [formula] at the time moment t in the μ + 1 space-time.

Let [formula] be the probability current vector [\cite=LNL2]. In this case

[formula]

is the probability density μ + 1vector.

The Clifford set of the range s is the set K of the s  ×  s complex matrices for which:

1) if γ∈K then γ2 = 1 (here 1 is the identity s  ×  s matrix);

2) if γ∈K and β∈K then γ  ·  β  +  β  ·  γ = 0 (here 0 is the zero s  ×  s matrix);

3) There does not exist the s  ×  s matrix ζ which anticommutates with all K elements, for which ζ2 = 1, and which is not the element of K.

For example, the Clifford pentad [formula] [\cite=LNL3] is the Clifford set of the range 4.

By [\cite=ZH] for every natural number z the Clifford set of the range 2z exists.

For every probability density vector [formula] the natural number s, the Clifford set K of range s and the complex s-vector [formula]exist, for which: γn∈K and

[formula]

[formula]

In this case let [formula] be named as the s-spinor for [formula].

If [formula] obeys to the continuity equation [\cite=LNL4] then from ([\ref=1]), ([\ref=1']): [formula] is fulfilled to the Dirac equation generalization on the μ + 1 space-time.

Let [formula] be the conditional probability density of the event A for the event B, but in the μ + 1 space-time, too. And if

[formula]

then the function [formula] is the interaction function for eA and eB, too, but in the μ + 1 space-time.

Let Ψc and Ψ be the s-spinors, for which: [formula] and [formula].

Let Ψc and Ψ are the elements of the algebra [formula] with the product *  , and for every Ψc and Ψ the element φ of [formula] exists, for which: Ψc  =  φ  *  Ψ and [formula].

In this case [formula] is the division normalized algebra and the [formula] dimension is not more than 8 from the Hurwitz theorem [\cite=O1] (The every normalized algebra with the unit is isomorphic to alone from the followings: the real numbers algebra R, the quaternions algebra K, or the octaves algebra Ó) and from the generalized Frobenius theorem [\cite=O2] (The division algebras have got the dimension 1,2,4 or 8, only). Therefore, the Clifford set matrices size are not more than 4  ×  4 (the Clifford matrices are the complex matrices). Such Clifford set contains not more than 5 elements. The diagonal elements of this pentad defines the space, in which the physics particle move. This space dimension is not more than 3 [\cite=LNL5]. Hence, in this case we have got 3+1 space.

If μ > 3 then for every algebra the interaction functions exist, which do not belong to this algebra. I'm name such interactions as the supernatural for this algebra interactions.

RESUME

1. All fermions and all interactions between fermions are expressed by the octaves in our space-time.

2. The probability, which is defined by the relativistic μ + 1-vector of the probability density, fulfils to the Quantum Theory principles.

3. In the μ+1 space-time: if μ  ≤  3 then the supernatural interactions do not happen, if μ > 3 then the supernatural interactions happen.
