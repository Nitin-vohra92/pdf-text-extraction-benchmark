On a Resolution of the Identity in Terms of Coherent States

BORIS F. SAMSONOV Tomsk State University, 634050 Tomsk, Russia email: samsonov@phys.tsu.ru

Abstract. Transformations of coherent states of the free particle by bounded and semibounded symmetry operators are considered. Resolution of the identity operator in terms of the transformed states is analyzed. A generalized identity resolution is formulated. Darboux transformation operators are analyzed as operators defined in a Hilbert space. Coherent states of multisoliton potentials are studied.

1. Introduction

The notion of coherent states is widely used in the modern quantum mechanics and mathematical physics [\cite=kl]-[\cite=Per]. The more typical properties of coherent states are summarized in the definition given by Klauder [\cite=Klaud]. In our interpretation this definition looks like as follows.

Every system of states described by vectors |ψz〉 is called the system of coherent states if the following conditions are fulfilled : (i) |ψz〉∈H0 where H0 is a Hilbert space; (ii) [formula] (iii) D is a domain endowed with a measure μ(z,), z,∈D which is defined and finite on a class of Borel sets of D and guaranties the following resolution of the identity operator [formula] on H0 :

[formula]

(iv) [formula], |ψz〉 belong to a domain of definition of a Hamiltonian h0 on H0 and are solutions to the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

The integral in equation ([\ref=1]) should be understood in a week sense. This means that if |ψn〉 is an orthonormal basis in H0 then this equation is equivalent to [formula] 〈ψz|ψn〉  =  δnk. If |ξn〉 is a Riesz basis in H0 (i.e. the basis equivalent to orthonormal, see e. g. [\cite=GK]) then formala ([\ref=1]) is equivalent to [formula].

In general, D is a domain in [formula]. In this letter we will restrict ourselves by the case [formula]. In this case we will omit the domain of integration in the integrals.

We introduce the property (iv) to satisfy the condition of "temporal stability" formulated in [\cite=Klaud].

The condition (iii) is one of the most remarcable properties of coherent states widely used in mathematical physics, quantum optics, group theory, and in other fields of physics and mathematics. For instance, it plays an important role in the Berezin quantization scheme [\cite=Ber], in the analysis of growth of holomorphic in D functions [\cite=Vourd], in a general theory of phase space quasiprobability distributions [\cite=BM], and in quantum state engineering [\cite=Vo].

In this letter we will demonstrate the insufficiency of this definition. In particular, we will construct a system of the vectors which satisfy all the conditions of the Definition [\ref=def1] except for the condition (iii). We will show that this system satisfies a more general condition. In this respect we propose a generalization of the Definition [\ref=def1].

Our example is related with the problem of a transformation of the coherent states. Let for a quantum system called initial system we know the coherent states |ψz〉 in the sense of the Definition [\ref=def1]. We suppose that this system has a nontrivial symmetry operator g0 defined as usually as an operator that transforms every solution of the Schrödinger equation ([\ref=2]) into another solution of the same equation. Let |ψz〉 belong to the domain of definition of g0. Consider the vectors |φz〉  =  g0|ψz〉, z∈D. It is clear that all the conditions of the Definition [\ref=def1] except may be for the condition (iii) are fulfilled. Problems that may be raised in this respect are the following: (a) To describe the properties of g0 in order that it produces the coherent states in the sense of the Definition [\ref=def1]; (b) To modify the condition (iii) when |φz〉 do not satisfy the property (iii); (c) To describe the properties of g0 in order that it produces the coherent states in the sense of the modified definition.

In this letter we give two examples of transformations. The first transformation is bounded and does not violate the property (iii). The states obtained with the help of the second transformation which is unbounded but closed satisfy a more general condition then that given by the equation ([\ref=1]). We will show that the integral in the equation ([\ref=1]) should be replaced by a functional defined over the set of the finite holomorphic in D functions. So, in this letter we will concentrate our attention only on the problem (b) raised above.

Finally we apply obtained results to coherent states of multisoliton potentials. For the case of the one soliton potential such states have been first introduced in [\cite=NF].

2. Coherent states of the free particle

The nonrelativistic free particle is the system very suitable for demonstrating various aspects of quantum mechanics. This is due in particular to the fact that the Schrödinger equation for this system has the more rich symmetry algebra. Moreover, the system of coherent states (in the sense of the Definition 1) is known for it [\cite=MM]. Another important property of the free particle Schrödinger equation that we will use in this letter consists in the fact that this equation is the basis one for obtaining the reflectionless potentials with discrete energy levels disposed in the desired manner (so called multisoliton potentials, see e.g. [\cite=Matv]).

In this section we review briefly the well known constructions related to the Hilbert space of the states of the free particle that we will need further.

Orthonormal set of solutions ψn(x,t) of the Schrödinger equation for the free particle is well known [\cite=Mil] and we do not cite it. We will denote by [formula] the lineal (i.e. the space of the finite linear combinations) of the elements ψn(x,t), [formula]. This lineal is an everywhere dense set in the space [formula] of the functions square integrable on [formula] with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The basis ψn(x,t) has the lowering a and raising a+ operators, [formula], aψ0(x,t) = 0, [formula]. The momentum operator px is expressed in terms of a and a+ as follows: px =  - i∂x =  - (a + a+) / 2. The free particle Hamiltomian is h0 =  - ∂2x = p2x.

Let us associate with the functions ψn(x,t) = 〈x|ψn〉 the elements |ψn〉 of an abstract vector space [formula]. Define the action of the linear raising a and lowering a+ operators on the basis elements |ψn〉 by the same relations: [formula], a|ψ0〉 = 0, [formula]. Since a and a+ are supposed to be linear, their action is defined for every |ψ〉∈L0 and a|ψ〉∈L0, a+|ψ〉∈L0. Moreover, px|ψ〉∈L0, h0|ψ〉∈L0, [formula] where px =  - (a + a+) / 2, h0 = p2x.

Let us define the scalar product 〈  ·  |  ·  〉 in L0, with the help of the coordinate representation ψ(x,t) = 〈x|ψ〉 of the vectors |ψ〉 and by using the ordinary Lebesgue integral.

Denote by H0 the completion of L0, H0  =  , with respect to the norm generated by this scalar product. It is well known that px and h0 are essentially self adjoint operators in [formula] with the well defined domains of definitions. In this context we will consider the closures x and 0 as the unique self adjoint extensions of the operators px and h0 initially defined on L0. The operator 0 is bounded from below. We will denote Dh0  ⊂  H0 its domain of definition which is dense in H0. In this construction the evolution parameter t (time) is involved in every element |ψ〉∈H0. Since a one parametric group of evolution operators Ut is continuous with respect to t and uniquely defined by the Schringer equation, the derivative of |ψ〉 with respect to t exists [formula] [\cite=Berez] and every |ψ〉∈Dh0 satisfies the Schrödinger equation.

The operators a and a+ initially defined on L0 may be extended to a domain D  ⊃  L0 common to both operators. The sum a + a+, the products aa+ and a+a are defined [formula]. Moreover, 〈ψb|aψb'〉  =  〈a+ψb|ψb'〉, [formula].

The basis vectors |ψn〉 are the eigenvectors of the operator g00 = aa+, g00|ψn〉 = (n + 1)|ψn〉. This operator is symmetric in D and bounded from below. The closure 00 of g00 is the unique self adjoint extension of this operator and it is defined [formula]. The operator K = - 100 is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator and it may be chosen to equip the Hilbert space H0 by the spaces H+ and H-, H+  ⊂  H0  ⊂  H- where H+ is dense in H0 and H- is the space of functionals off H+. The operator K may be restricted to H+. The operator K+ conjugate to K has in this case a natural extension to the space H-. The operator K defines an isometry H0  →  H+ and K+ an isometry H-  →  H0 (see e.g. [\cite=Berez]).

Every self adjoint in H0 operator A has a complete system of the generalized eigenvectors |ψλ〉 which are the functionals from H-. They are defined with the help of the measure σ(λ) = 〈e|Pλe〉 where Pλ is the spectral function of A and |e〉 is some element from H0 as follows: [formula], A|ψλ〉  =  λ|ψλ〉 [\cite=GSh]. The completeness of the system [formula] means that the Fourier transform ψ(λ) = 〈ψλ|ψ〉 of an element |ψ〉∈H0 belongs to the space L2(dσ) of the functions square integrable with respect to the measure σ(λ) and the Parseval equality is valid [formula] for all |ψ〉∈H0. The inverse transform is written as [formula]. This equality should be understood in the week sense, i.e. [formula] we have [formula]. The latter relations may be summarized in the equation

[formula]

that should be understood in the week sense.

Operator x has only a continuous spectrum. Let |ψp〉, [formula] be its generalized eigenvectors. Then their completeness and orthonormality may be written in the form

[formula]

Coherent states |ψz〉 of the free particle may be obtained by the action on |ψ0〉 by the displacement operator [\cite=Per]

[formula]

These vectors are the eigenvectors of the lowering operator a, a|ψz〉 = z|ψz〉, [formula]. The Fourier expansion of |ψz〉 in terms of the basis |ψn〉 looks like as follows:

[formula]

We denote by [formula] the value complex conjugate to z. The functions ψz(x,t) = 〈x|ψz〉 and ψz(p,t) = 〈ψp|ψz〉 are well known [\cite=MM]. The vectors |ψz〉 are the coherent states in the sense of the Definition 1. The measure dμ in the equation ([\ref=1]) is equal to dμ = dxdy / π, z = x + iy.

Since |ψp〉 is the basis in H0 the equation ([\ref=1]) is equivalent to

[formula]

3. Transformation of the coherent states by symmetry operators

Let us consider a linear symmetry operator g0 initially defined on L0 with the help of an Hermitian matrix [formula], Snk  =  S̄kn, [formula]. We will suppose that every row (and column consequently) of the matrix S contains a finite number of non zero elements. In this case the operator g0 is symmetric in L0 and maps L0  →  L0. Moreover, we will suppose that g0 is bounded from below, positive definite, and essentially self adjoint in H0 so that 0  =  +0. Let D0(  ⊂  H0) be the domain of definition of 0.

Under these assumptions the operator - 10 is uniquely defined and bounded in H0. Its domain of definition is the whole H0.

The operators ±  1 / 20 such that ±  1 / 20±  1 / 20  =  ±  10 are uniquely defined on H0 as well. The domain of definition of - 1 / 20 is the whole H0. Denote D'0(  ⊃  D0) the domain of definition of 1 / 20. It may be analyzed with the help of Friedrichs extension (see e.g. [\cite=Smirn]) of g0 up to 0. We notice that |ψn〉∈D0  ⊂  D'0

The systems [formula], |ρn〉  =  1 / 20|ψn〉 and [formula], |ξn〉  =  - 1 / 20|ψn〉 are biorthogonal Riesz basiss in H0

We will not dwell on the proof of this lemma. We note only that

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=1]) may be rewritten both in terms of the basis |ρn〉

[formula]

and in terms of the basis |ξn〉

[formula]

The elements Snk of the matrix S and the elements S- 1nk of the matrix S- 1 may be calculated with the help of the generalized eigenvectors |ψλ〉 of the operator 0, 0|ψλ〉  =  λ|ψλ〉

[formula]

[formula]

where dσ(λ) is the measure that guaranties the spectral resolution of 0.

It is not difficult to see that if f(x) is some positive polynomial, f(x) > 0, [formula] and g0 = f(px) then all the above assumptions imposed on g0 are fulfilled.

Proof. It is obvious that it is sufficient to establish the resolution of the identity operator. Our proof is constructive and we will only sketch it.

Let us suppose that the measure μξ  =  μξ(z,) that realizes the resolution of the identity in terms of the vectors |ξz〉 exists and try to find it. We will see that it is possible if the measure is such that dμξ  =  ωξ(x)dxdy.

To find the density ωξ(x) we use the generalized eigenvectors |ψp〉 of the operator x which are the eigenvectors of 0 as well. Then using the expression

[formula]

the form ([\ref=dpq]) of the formula ([\ref=1]), and integrating with respect to the variable y we arrive at the equation for ωξ(x)

[formula]

It is clearly seen from this relation that the smooth function ωξ(x) is a polynomial in x completely defined by the coefficients of the polynomial f(p). This proves the assertion. (Q.E.D.)

The measure dμξ is a solution to the follwing problem of moments on the complex plane :

[formula]

This assertion follows immediately from the resolution of the identity in terms of the vectors |ξz〉 and the property 〈ρn|ξz〉  =  Φanzn (see Lemma 1).

Given the identity resolution we may construct a holomorphic representation of the space H0 and the operators on it. We do not dwell on these constructions.

Let us consider the vectors [formula]. The function [formula] is a polynomial in z since the sum is finite. It is not difficult to see that when g0 = f(px) and f(x) is a polynomial of order 2N then the number max kSnk have the following asymptotic behavior: max kSnk  →  CnN when n  →    ∞   where C is a constant. As a result the series [formula] converges [formula]. This means that the vector |ρz〉 has a finite norm and consequently |ρz〉∈H0. It follows that [formula] and 1 / 20|ψz〉 = |ρz〉. The natural question that arises in this respect is the following: whether the states |ρz〉 may be considered as coherent states.

Let us suppose that the measure μρ  =  μρ(z,) that realizes the resolution of the identity operator in terms of the vectors |ρz〉 exists and try to find it. Taking into account the above considerations we will suppose that μρ is such that dμρ = dνρ(x)dy. The equation ([\ref=ffm2]) takes in this case the form:

[formula]

We have not succeed to solve this equation in the ordinary functions but we have found its solution as a generalized function. We notice that |Fp(x + iy)|  ≤   exp ( - dx2 + by2),  2  ≤  d  ≤  b. It follows that Fp(x)∈S1 / 21 / 2, where the space S1 / 21 / 2 is defined as the space of entire functions F such that |F(x + iy)|  ≤   exp ( - dx2 + by2), 0 < d  ≤  b [\cite=GS]. We may try to find νρ as a functional off the space S1 / 21 / 2.

It is well known [\cite=GS] that a positive definite generalized function ν over the space S1 / 21 / 2 may have an integral representation in the space of the Fourier transforms.

Let [formula] be the Fourier transform of the function Fp(x). We will understand the integral in the left hand side of the equation ([\ref=F]) as a generalized function over the space S1 / 21 / 2 defined by the measure ρ(t) in the space of the Fourier transforms

[formula]

The equation ([\ref=F]) results then in the equation for ρ(t)

[formula]

We will give the solution to this equation for the particular case of the function f(x) that we need further. Let f(x) be a polynomial of order 2N and the zeros of f(x) be purely imaginary. Every such a polynomial may be presented in the form: [formula], αk > 0. The value of the coefficient A0 is without importance for our purpose and we put A0 = 1. Then the function 1 / f(x) may be presented in the form:

[formula]

It can be seen now from ([\ref=Ff]) that if dρ(t) = ρ(t)dt then for the density ρ(t) we have the expression

[formula]

It is necessary to note that the integral in the right hand side of ([\ref=FF]) converges not for all functions F(x)∈S1 / 21 / 2. It is easy to see that the convergence condition of this integral translates into the condition of the decreasing of the functions F(x) when |x|  →    ∞  . We should take only such functions F(x)∈S1 / 21 / 2 that the following inequality takes place: |F(x)|  ≥   exp ( - 2x2 - Ax) where A  ≥  0 is some positive constant own to the function F(x). Let us denote by [formula] all the functions from S1 / 21 / 2 satisfying this condition. It is apparent that [formula] is a linear space.

We see hence that the integral in the left hand side of the equation ([\ref=dpq]) should be understood as an Hermitian, linear on the second argument and antilinear on the first argument, continuous on both arguments, bounded, positive definite functional ωρ acting on the functions

[formula]

as follows

[formula]

This functional is defined with the help of the Fourier transform p(t) of the function Fp(x) defined by the relation

[formula]

It is not difficult to see that the function

[formula]

belongs to the space [formula] when |ρa,b〉∈Lρ. The same is true when we take |ξa,b〉∈Lξ instead of |ρa,b〉. By using the biorthogonality of the systems [formula] and [formula] (see Lemma 1) we derive that 〈ξn|ρz〉  =  Φanzn. It follows that the functional ωρ gives a solution to the following problem of moments on the complex plane:

[formula]

(Compare with the Corollary [\ref=cor2].)

The function Φ is defined by the initial coherent states and it does not depend on the transformation used. This means that the functional ωρ is really defined on the elements anzn which are the basis elements in the space Lμ of the finite holomorphic functions. This functional has all the properties necessary to define a scalar product in Lμ. Therefore we may consider the completion of the lineal Lμ with respect to the norm generated by this scalar product and obtain the Hilbert space Hμ  =  μ of functions holomorphic in [formula]. (Compare with the Remark [\ref=R1].)

It is now clear how we should adjust the Definition 1 to take in consideration the obtained results.

Let |ψn〉 be such a basis in the Hilbert space H0 that the vectors |ψz〉 have the form : [formula] where an > 0 are some numbers and Φ  =  Φ(z,) is some real valued function. By coherent states we shall mean the states described by the vectors |ψz〉 which satisfy the Definition 1 where the property (iii) is replaced by (iii�): in the space of the finite holomorphic functions there exists a functional ω which is Hermitian, linear in the second argument and antilinear in the first argument, continuous in both arguments, bounded, positive definite, and such that the following resolution of the identity operator acting in H0 is valid

[formula]

where the equality is understood in the week sense.

We summarize the above results in the following

4. Applications. Coherent states of multisoliton potentials

It is well known (see e.g. [\cite=Matv]) that the soliton potentials may be obtained by Darboux transformations of the free particle Schrödinger equation. The Darboux transformation operator, L, that transforms the solutions of the Schrödinger equation with zero potential to the solutions of the same equation with multisoliton potential is well known as well [\cite=Matv].

Let h1 be the Hamiltonian of a multisoliton potential having N discrete spectrum levels E- i =  - α2- i, αi > 0 with the eigenfunctions φ- i(x,t), [formula]. If we denote L+ the operator formally adjoint to L then [formula]. The operators L and L+ have the remarkable factorization property [\cite=Rev]: L+L = f(h0) = g0, LL+ = f(h1) = g1 where [formula]. It should be noted that h0 = p2x and f(p2x) = f0(px) where f0(x) is the polynomial introduced above. The functions φn(x,t) = Lψn(x,t) are orthogonal to the space  kerL+. Therefor we may consider the orthogonal decomposition [formula] where L20 is the closure of the space  kerL+ and L21 is the closure of [formula], [formula]. In what follows we will not consider the space L20 and concentrate our attention only on the space L21.

Operators L, L+, g0 and g1 participate in the following intertwining relations: Lg0 = g1L, g0L+ = L+g1 which hold in the lineal [formula] and [formula] respectively. Therefor if [formula] then [formula] (the sums are finite). We notice as well that 0 and 1 are the unique self adjoint extensions of g0 and g1 respectively.

Let ψp(x,t) be the generalized eigenfunctions of 0

[formula]

The functions

[formula]

are the generalized eigenfunctions of 1, 1φp(x,t) = p2φp(x,t).

The operator L+ realizes the transformation in the inverse direction, L+φp(x,t) = Npψp(x,t). The functions ψp(x,t) are the generalized eigenfunctions of the operator 0 = f(0), 0ψp(x,t) = f(p2)ψp(x,t) and the functions φp(x,t) are the similar ones for 1 = f(1), 1φp(x,t) = f(p2)φp(x,t).

In this section we will give rigorous constructions related with the multisoliton potentials and establish the relationship between the Darboux transformation operator L and the spectral resolutions of the operators 0 and 1. A polar factorization of the operator L will be derived. Then we will introduce two kinds of coherent states for multisoliton potentials. The first states are the coherent ones in the sense of the Definition 1 and the second states are the similar ones but in the sense of the Definition 2.

Let us associate with the functions φn(x,t) the vectors |φn〉 = L|ψn〉. Denote by [formula], [formula]. The operator L is supposed to be linear by definition. Therefor it is defined [formula] and maps L0 onto L1. Let us define for every |φn〉 = L|ψn〉, [formula] the linear operator L+ by the relation [formula] (the sum is finite). It is clear that L+ is defined [formula] and it maps L1 onto L0.

Let us define the scalar product on L1 by the equation

[formula]

Henceforth we label the scalar product in H0 by the subscript 0. Let H1  =   be the completion of L1 with respect to the norm generated by this scalar product. It is necessary to note that the set [formula] is a basis in H1, 〈φk|φn〉1 = Skn. We will show further that it is a Riesz basis and will find a basis biorthogonal with it.

The operator L has such an extension [formula] that it domain of definition is D'0 and it domain of values is H1.

Proof. Let [formula] be a vector from D'0. Then [formula]. It follows that 〈φ|φ〉1 = c <   ∞   where [formula]. So, we may put [formula], [formula] as the definition of [formula]. It is evident that [formula] is the extension of L since |ψn〉 = L|ψn〉 = |φn〉.

Consider an element |φ〉∈H1, [formula], [formula]. Consider now the vector |ψ〉∈H0 defined by the same Fourier coefficients cn with respect to the basis |ψn〉, [formula]. The square of the norm of 1 / 20|ψ〉 equal [formula] is finite. It follows that |ψ〉∈D'0 and by the definition of [formula] we have |ψ〉 = |φ〉. This proves the assertion. (Q.E.D.)

Let us define now for every |φ〉  =  |ψ〉∈H1, such that |ψ〉∈D0(  ⊂  D�0), the operator + by the formula +|φ〉  =  0|ψ〉. Let D1 be it domain of definition. The domain D1 consists of all |φ〉∈H1 of the form |φ〉  =  |ψ〉 where |ψ〉∈D0. It is obvious that D1 is dence in H1.

0  =  +.

Proof. Since [formula] we have +|φ〉∈L0 and +|φ〉 = g0|φ〉, the operator + is the extension of g0 and it has the domain of definition equal D0. Taking into consideration that g0 has the unique extension 0 with D0 as the domain of definition we get 0  =  +. (Q.E.D.)

+ is adjoint to [formula] with respect to the scalar products 〈  ·  |  ·  〉0 and 〈  ·  |  ·  〉1

Proof. The assertion follows from the chain of equalities 〈+φa|ψb〉0  =  〈0ψa|ψb〉0  =  〈ψa|0ψb〉0 =  〈φa|φb〉1  =  〈φa|ψb〉1 where |ψa,b〉∈D0, |φa,b〉  =  |ψa,b〉∈D1. (Q.E.D.)

=  +  +.

Proof. The assertion follows immediately from the equality +0  =  0 and Lemma 3. (Q.E.D.)

The operator [formula] is closed.

We will take without proving the following

There exists an equipment of H1, H1 +  ⊂  H1  ⊂  H1 - such that the set of functionals from H1 - of the form |φp〉 = N- 1p|ψp〉, |ψp〉∈H1 -, N2p = f(p2), [formula], is orthonormal 〈φq|φp〉1  =  δ(q - p) and complete in H1.

We denote by the same symbol [formula] the extension of [formula] to the space H-.

A similar statement has been first formulated by Krein [\cite=Krein] for a Sturm-Liouville problem. It really means that the Darboux transformation operator being applied to a complete set of vectors of the initial system gives once again a complete set of vectors (in an appropriate space) of the transformed system.

Let us denote 1  =  +. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lm5] that +1  =  1. Moreover, since 0|ψp〉 = f(p2)|ψp〉, [formula], we have 1|φp〉 = f(p2)|φp〉. This implies that if 1 = f(1) then 1|φp〉 = p2|φp〉 and the self-adjoint operator 1 is defined by the spectral resolution

[formula]

in a dense set of the space H1. It is clear that 1 corresponds to the restriction of the multisoliton Hamiltonian to the space L21.

If we define the linear symmetric operator g1 on L1 by the formula [formula] (the sum is finite) then 1 is the unique self adjoint extension of g1.

The basis [formula] is not orthogonal in H1. We will construct now the basis [formula] biorthogonal to [formula].

Since 0 is positive definite in H0, the equation +|φ〉 = 0, |φ〉∈D1 has the unique solution |φ〉 = 0. It follows that + is invertible. Let us define [formula] the operator M by the relation M+|φ〉 = |φ〉. The vector +|φ〉  =  1|ψ〉 belongs to the space H0 when |ψ〉∈D0. Therefor the operator M = (+)- 1 is defined on H0. The restriction of M on the lineal L0 coincides with the integral transformation operator introduced in [\cite=BSjetp] [\cite=BS].

Consider the vectors |ηn〉 = M|ψn〉. It is clear that 〈ηk|φn〉1  =  〈ψk|Mψn〉1  =  δkn. Therefor the system [formula] is biorthogonal to [formula].

Operator U = - 1 / 20 realizes the isometric mapping of the domain D'0 onto D1. Operator U+ = U- 1  =  - 1 / 20+ realizes the inverse mapping. Operators U and U+ have the following resolutions in terms of the generalized eigenvectors |ψp〉 and |φp〉 :

[formula]

Proof. Let |ψ〉∈D'0. Then - 1 / 20|ψ〉∈D0 since 0- 1 / 20|ψ〉  =  1 / 20|ψ〉. Therefor - 1 / 20|ψ〉∈D1 when |ψ〉∈D�0. If |φ〉∈D1 then +|φ〉 = |ψ〉∈H0 and U+|φ〉  =  - 1 / 20|ψ〉∈D'0. This means that the domain of values of U+ is D'0 and it is defined on D1. It is easy to check that U conserves the value of the norm 〈ψ|ψ〉0  =  〈- 1 / 20ψ|- 1 / 20ψ〉1. The first formula ([\ref=UU]) follows from the spectral resolution for - 1 / 20. The second formula is the conjugation of the first. (Q.E.D.)

From ([\ref=UU]) it follows the spectral representation for [formula] and +

[formula]

and the similar representation for M and M+

[formula]

Operators M and M+ are bounded and factorize the operators - 10 and - 11: M+M = - 10, MM+  =  - 11.

The set [formula], |ξn〉 = U|ψn〉  =  1 / 21|ηn〉  =  - 1 / 21|φn〉 is an orthonormal set in H1 and [formula], [formula] are biorthogonal Riesz basiss in H1.

The representation  = U1 / 20 is a canonical representation of the closed operator [formula] and M = U- 1 / 20 is the similar representation of the bounded operator M (see e.g. [\cite=Danf]). These representations are called polar factorisations as well [\cite=RS].

We have seen that |ψz〉∈D'0. Therefor the action of [formula] on |ψz〉 is defined. Consider the vectors

[formula]

The states associated with the vectors |ηz〉 are coherent states in the sense of the Definition 1. The vectors |φz〉 satisfy the Definition 2.

Proof. We note first of all that all the conditions of the definitions 1 and 2 are fulfilled except may be for the property (iii) and (iii�). If the measure μη  =  μη(z,) that realizes the resolution of the identity in terms of the vectors |ηz〉 exists then it gives the solution to the problem of moments

[formula]

According to the Corollary 3 we have dμη = dμξ. Similarly, if the functional ω  =  ωφ that realizes the identity decomposition in terms of the vectors |φz〉 exists then it should give the solution to the problem

[formula]

According to the Theorem 2 we state that it is the functional ωρ that solves this problem and ωφ  =  ωρ. This proves the assertion. (Q.E.D.)

5. Conclusion

In this letter we have given a rigorous mathematical meaning to the idea first stated in [\cite=BSjetp] [\cite=BS]. In short terms, we have formulated such a definition of coherent states that the states obtained by means of the Darboux transformation operator from coherent states of the free particle are coherent states of multisoliton potential. The main feature of our definition is the existence of the resolution of the identity operator which has a more general form then that ordinary used in other definitions. Nevertheless, our resolution of the identity permits one to construct the holomorphic representation of the Hilbert space of the states of a quantum system and the operators on it. This open the door to introduce a phase space and classical observables as covariant Berezin symbols [\cite=Ber]. In this way it is possible to obtain a classical system the Berezin quantization of which gives the quantum system that we have started with. This program has been realized in [\cite=jmp] for the potential V0(x) = γx- 2. They have shown that at classical level the Darboux transformation reduces to such a transformation of Kähler potential and Poisson bracket that the equations of motion remain unchanged. The similar calculations are now possible for multisoliton potentials.
