Corollary Proposition

Rings whose modules are weakly supplemented are perfect.

H.Bass characterized in [\cite=Bass] those ring R whose left R-modules have projective covers and termed them left perfect rings. He characterized them as those semilocal rings which have a left t-nilpotent Jacobson radical [formula]. Bass' semiperfect rings are those whose finitely generated left (or right) R-modules have projective covers and can be characterized as those semilocal rings which have the property that idempotents lift modulo [formula]. Kasch and Mares transfered in [\cite=KaschMares] the notions of perfect and semiperfect rings to modules and characterized semiperfect modules by a lattice theoretical condition as follows: a module M is called supplemented if for any submodule N of M there exists a submodule L of M minimal with respect to M = N + L. The left perfect rings are then shown to be exactly those rings whose left R-modules are supplemented while the semiperfect rings are those whose finitely generated left R-modules are supplemented. Equivalently it is enough for a ring R to be semiperfect if the left (or right) R-module R is supplemented. Recall that a submodule N of a module M is called small, denoted by N  ≪  M, if N + L  ≠  M for all proper submodules L of M. Weakening the "supplemented"-condition one calls a module weakly supplemented if for every submodule N of M there exists a submodule L of M with N + L = M and [formula]. The semilocal rings R are precisely those rings whose finitely generated left (or right) R-modules are weakly supplemented. Again it is enough that R is weakly supplemented as left (or right) R-module. Semilocal rings which are not semiperfect are examples of weakly supplemented modules which are not supplemented. In this note we prove that if R is semilocal and the radical of the countably infinite free left R-module has a weak supplement, then R has to be left perfect, i.e. every left R-module is supplemented.

Throught this note all rings are associative with unit and modules are considered to be unital. An ideal I of a ring R is called left t-nilpotent if for any family [formula] of elements of R there exists n > 0 such that [formula]. A ring R is left perfect if and only if it is semilocal and [formula] is left t-nilpotent. Recall that an infinite family {Aλ|λ∈Λ} of left ideals of R is called left vanishing if given any sequence [formula] with ai∈Aλi and λi  ≠  λj for all i  ≠  j, there exists a number n  ≥  1 for which [formula]. Ware and Zelmanowitz proved in [\cite=WareZelmanowitz] that for any endomorphism [formula] of a free module F and endomorphism which belongs to the Jacobson radical [formula], the family [formula] of left ideals of R is left vanishing. Using this result we can prove our main theorem:

The following statements are equivalent for a ring R:

Every left R-module is weakly supplemented;

[formula] is weakly supplemented;

R is semilocal and [formula] has a weak supplement in [formula].

R is left perfect.

(d)  ⇒  (a)  ⇒  (b)  ⇒  (c) is clear and we just need to show (c)  ⇒  (d): Set [formula] and denote [formula]. Suppose that R is semilocal and [formula] has a weak supplement in F. Let L be a weak supplement of JF in F, i.e. JF  +  L  =  F and [formula]. Then R = πi(JF + L)  =  J  +  πi(L)  =  πi(L) for any [formula] implies that there exists xi∈L such that πi(xi) = 1. Let [formula] be any family of elements of J then [formula] and πi(aixi) = ai for any [formula]. Define f:F  →  F by [formula] for all z∈F. Since [formula], we get by Ware and Zelmanowitz's Theorem [\cite=WareZelmanowitz] that [formula] is left vanishing. Thus there exists n > 0 such that

[formula]

This shows that [formula] is left t-nilpotent and hence R is left perfect.

Let σ[M] denote the Wisbauer category of a module M, i.e. the full category of R-Mod consisting of submodules of quotients of direct sums of copies of M. A module M is called a self-generator if any of its submodules is an image of a direct sum of copies of M.

Let M be a finitely generated, self-projective, self-generator. Then every module in σ[M] is weakly supplemented if and only if [formula] is left perfect.

By [\cite=Wisbauer] M is projective in σ[M] and by [\cite=Wisbauer] M is a generator in σ[M]. Hence by [\cite=Wisbauer] the functor [formula] is a Morita equivalence between σ[M] and [formula]-Mod. Thus every module in σ[M] is weakly supplemented if and only if every left [formula]-module is weakly supplemented, which holds if and only if [formula] is left perfect by the Theorem.

We finish the paper with a comment on weak supplements of images of endomorphisms. Recall that a left R-module M is called semi-projective if for any endomorphism [formula] we have [formula]. The module M is called π-projective if for any submodules N,L of M with M = N + L we have [formula].

Suppose M is a semi-projective and π-projective R-module. Then [formula] is regular if and only if [formula] has a weak supplement in M for each f∈S.

(  ⇒  ) Let f∈S. By hypothesis there is a g∈S such that f - fgf∈J(S). We have [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula], but since [formula] we have [formula]. Hence [formula] is a weak supplement of [formula] in M.

(⇐) Let f∈S and K be a weak supplement of [formula] in M. Since M is semi-projective and π-projective we have [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], we get [formula]. Thus Sf has weak supplement for all f, which implies [formula] being von Neumann regular by [\cite=Lomp].

The last proposition generalizes [\cite=Lomp]. Also as a consequence we conclude that the endomorphism ring of a semi-projective, π-projective weakly supplemented module is regular modulo its Jacobson radical.
