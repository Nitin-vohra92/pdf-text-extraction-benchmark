A NOTE ON GROUPS WITH THE MINIMAL CONDITIONS FOR NONABELIAN AND ABELIAN SUBGROUPS

chern@imath.kiev.ua

We give a new proof of the known Shunkov's Theorem on locally finite groups with the minimal condition for nonabelian subgroups and also an extension of the known Suchkova-Shunkov Theorem on Shunkov groups with the minimal condition for abelian subgroups.

The celebrated Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=1] asserts that a locally finite group, which satisfies the minimal condition for abelian subgroups, is Chernikov. Another known Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=2] establishes that a nonabelian locally finite group H, satisfying the minimal condition for nonabelian subgroups, is Chernikov too. Further, a nonabelian almost solvable group with the minimal condition for nonabelian subgroups is itself Chernikov (S.N.Chernikov's Theorem [\cite=3]).

Below we'll give a new proof of Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=2], which is based on Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=1] and S.N.Chernikov's Theorem [\cite=3] and on the following proposition.

Proposition. If an abelian subgroup A of the locally finite group G is nonnormal and maximal in it, then

[formula]

and for some normal subgroup N of G,

[formula]

Proof. Let A be nonnormal and maximal in G. It is easy to see that for [formula], G = 〈A,Ag〉. So [formula]. But, clearly, Z(G)  ⊆  A,Ag. Thus [\eqref=1] is correct. Therefore

[formula]

Then, with regard to [\eqref=3], by Busarkin-Starostin-Kegel Theorem [\cite=4]-[\cite=6], for some normal subgroup N of G, [\eqref=2] are correct.

Proof of Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=2]. Let H be non-Chernikov. Then, obviously, H contains some non- (Chernikov or abelian) subgroup G such that any its proper subgroup is Chernikov or abelian. In view of Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=1], some maximal abelian subgroup A of G is non-Chernikov. Obviously, A is maximal in G. In view of S.N.Chernikov's Theorem [\cite=3], G is not almost solvable. Hence follows that A is not normal in G. Consequently, for some proper normal subgroup N of G, G = AN (see Proposition). Clearly, N is almost solvable and G / N is abelian. But then, obviously, G is almost solvable, which is a contradiction.

Recall that by definition a group G is Shunkov, if for any finite subgroup K of G, each subgroup of NG(K) / K, generated by two its conjugated elements of prime order, is finite. According to Suchkova-Shunkov Theorem [\cite=7], which generalizes Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=1], Shunkov groups with the minimal condition for abelian subgroups are Chernikov. Also by [\cite=8], nonabelian periodic Shunkov groups with the minimal condition for nonabelian subgroups are Chernikov too.

Below we prove the following proposition based on Suchkova-Shunkov Theorem [\cite=7].

Theorem. Let [formula] be a class of groups in which any periodic subgroup is Shunkov, [formula] be the minimal local class of groups containing [formula] and closed with respect to subgroups and ascending series. Then any [formula]-group satisfies the minimal condition for abelian subgroups iff it is Chernikov.

Let [formula] be the class consisting of all groups isomorphic to subgroups of [formula]-groups, and by induction for ordinals β > 0: if there exists an ordinal α such that β  =  α + 1, then [formula] be the class of all groups, possessing a local system of subgroups that have a series with [formula]-factors, and if there is no such α, then [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] is the union of classes [formula].

Suppose that the present theorem is not correct. Let γ be the least one among all α, for which [formula] contains a non-Chernikov group Gα satisfying the minimal condition for abelian subgroups. In view of Suchkova-Shunkov Theorem [\cite=7], γ > 0. It is easy to see that for some ordinal ν, γ  =  ν + 1. Consequently, G = Gγ has a local system M of subgroups possessing an ascending series with [formula]-factors.

In view of Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=1], G is not locally finite. So some H∈M is not locally finite too. Let [formula] be an ascending series of H with [formula]-factors and Hδ be the union of all locally finite terms of the series. Then, clearly, Hδ itself is locally finite. Since Hδ + 1 is not locally finite, in consequence of O.J.Schmidt's Theorem, Hδ + 1 / Hδ is not locally finite too. At the same time, Hδ + 1 / Hδ is non-Chernikov. The [formula]-group Hδ + 1 / Hδ contains a non-Chernikov abelian subgroup A / Hδ. Since Hδ + 1 satisfies the minimal condition for abelian subgroups, it is periodic. So A / Hδ is periodic and, at the same time, locally finite. Then by O.J.Schmidt's Theorem, A is locally finite. Since A satisfies the minimal condition for abelian subgroups, it is Chernikov (Shunkov's Theorem [\cite=1]). But then A / Hδ must be Chernikov, which is a contradiction. Theorem is proven.
