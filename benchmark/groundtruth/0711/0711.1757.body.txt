Introduction

It is well known that the structure of the nucleon is parametrized in terms of form factors. The electromagnetic form factors of nucleon are measured in a wide range of momentum transfer squared q2 (see for example [\cite=R8301] and the references therein). But, in contrast to the electromagnetic case, the form factors GA(q2), GP(q2) and GT(q2) due to isovector axial-vector current are not known. The nucleon matrix elements of axial-vector currents at q2 = 0 are determined by the axial-vector coupling constants such as gA (isovector), g8A (octet), gSA (isoscalar) and g0A (flavor singlet). Among these only nucleon isovector coupling constant gA is well known which is measured from the neutron β-decay. Knowledge of any three of these coupling constants determines the quark spin content of the nucleon. For this reason study of these constants receives great interest.

Using the Lorentz covariance, the matrix element of the isovector axial-vector current between initial and final states is parametrized as

[formula]

where Aμ  =  ūγμγ5u  -  γμγ5d, [formula], mN is the nucleon mass, and GA, GP and GT are the axial, induced pseudoscalar and induced tensorial form factors, respectively, induced by the isovector and axial-vector currents. The matrix element of isoscalar axial-vector current ASμ  =  ūγμγ5u  +  γμγ5d between nucleon states is determined similar to ([\ref=e8301]) with the following replacements: GA  →  GSA, GP  →  GSP and GT  →  GST (here the superscript S means isoscalar). The form factors GT and GST both vanish as a result of the exact isospin symmetry and G-parity invariance of the strong interaction.

The aim of the present work is the calculation of the form factors GA(GSA) and GP(GSP) in the framework of light cone QCD sum rules (LCSR) [\cite=R8303] [\cite=R8304] approach, using the most general form of nucleon interpolating current. LCSR is based on the operator product expansion over twist of the operators near the light cone. This method combines the standard sum rules technique [\cite=R8305] with the parton distribution amplitudes describing the hard exclusive processes. This method is widely applied to the problems in the meson sector (see [\cite=R8304]). Lately, the electromagnetic form factors of nucleon [\cite=R8306], the scalar form factor of nucleon [\cite=R8307] and the weak [formula] [\cite=R8308] are investigated in the baryonic sector in the framework of this method. Note that higher twist amplitudes of the nucleon are calculated in [\cite=R8309].

The outline of this work is as follows. In section 2 the basic ingredients for calculating the form factors due to axial-vector current are introduced and sum rules for the form factors are constructed. In section 3 we present our numerical results together with the concluding remarks.

Sum rules for the form factors of the nucleon due to isovector and isoscalar currents

In this section, we construct sum rules for the form factors of the nucleon due to the isovector and isoscalar axial-vector currents. For this purpose we start by considering the polarization operator, which is the basic object of the sum rule approach,

[formula]

where

[formula]

with the upper (lower) sign corresponding to the isovector (isoscalar) axial-vector current, and η is an interpolating current with nucleon quantum numbers. The nucleon interpolating currents without the derivative terms, and with nucleon quantum numbers, can be written as [\cite=R8310]

[formula]

where A11 = I, A12  =  γ5 , A21  =  γ5 , A22  =  β; C is the charge conjugation operator; a, b, c are the color indices, and z is a light-like vector with z2 = 0. The choice β =  - 1 in Eq. ([\ref=e8303]) corresponds to the Ioffe current [\cite=R8311]. Note that η2 current is modified in the following way [\cite=R8309]

[formula]

The axial form factor and induced pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon are calculated in [\cite=R8312] in the framework of LCSR using the current η3(x). However the current η3(x) couples to both spin 1 / 2 and 3 / 2 baryons. Therefore, for a reliable determination of the form factors the unwanted contributions coming from spin 3 / 2 states should be eliminated. But this elimination is not done in [\cite=R8312].

Note that the form factors GA(Q2) and GP(Q2) induced by the isovector axial current are calculated in [\cite=R8313] in LCSR using the Ioffe current.

In the present work we calculate the form factors induced by isovector and isoscalar axial-vector currents using the general form of the interpolating η1(x).

We start by calculating the correlation function ([\ref=e8301]) from the QCD side. At large Euclidean momenta [formula] and q2 =  - Q2 the correlation function can be calculated perturbatively. Using the expressions of interpolating currents we get the following result for the correlator:

[formula]

where Sq( - x) is the light quark propagator and its light cone expanded expression is [\cite=R8313]

[formula]

The terms proportional to Gμν in Eq. ([\ref=e8307]) give contribution to four- and five-particle nucleon distribution functions, and these amplitudes are expected to be small [\cite=R8314] [\cite=R8315] which will be neglected in further analysis. Only the first term in Eq. ([\ref=e8307]) survives since Borel transformation kills the second term.

It follows from Eq. ([\ref=e8306]) that for the calculation of Πμ we need to know the matrix element [formula]. This matrix element of nonlocal operator is defined in terms of the nucleon distribution amplitudes (DAs), and their explicit expressions are presented in [\cite=R8309] [\cite=R8313] [\cite=R8316] [\cite=R8317] [\cite=R8318].

Using the explicit expressions of the nucleon DAs and performing integration over x and selecting the structures [formula] for GA(GSA) and [formula] for GP(GSP), we get

[formula]

where upper (lower) sign corresponds to isovector (isoscalar) axial-vector current, and

[formula]

Those functions appearing in Eqs. ([\ref=e8308]) and ([\ref=e8309]) are determined as

[formula]

whose explicit expressions are given in [\cite=R8313].

Physical part of the correlation function is obtained by inserting a complete set of states between the currents in Eq. ([\ref=e8301]) with the same quantum numbers of the current η(x). After isolating the pole term of the nucleon state, the correlator function ([\ref=e8301]) can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] and q is the momentum carried by the axial-vector current. The second term in ([\ref=e8310]) describes the higher states and continuum contribution, and h is complete set of the hadrons with the quantum numbers of the ground state nucleon.

Contribution of higher states to the physical part of the sum rules are taken into account using quark-hadron duality, i.e., spectral density for higher states is equal to the perturbative spectral density starting from s > s0, where s0 is the continuum threshold.

The matrix elements entering to Eq. ([\ref=e8310]) are defined as

[formula]

Substituting Eqs. ([\ref=e8311]) and ([\ref=e8312]) into Eq. ([\ref=e8310]) and selecting the structures [formula] and [formula] and performing Borel transformation with respect to the variable (q - p)2, which suppresses the continuum and higher state contributions, we get the above-mentioned form factors:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

In performing Borel transformation, we use the following substitution rules (see for example [\cite=R8312] [\cite=R8313] and [\cite=R8319])

[formula]

where

[formula]

and x0 is the solution of the quadratic equation for s = s0, i.e.,

[formula]

and Q2  =    -  q2.

Results and discussion

Now we are ready to examine the sum rules for the form factors. It follows from expressions of the sum rules for form factors that DAs are the main input parameters of LCSR. The complete list of all DAs which enter to the sum rules for form factors can be found in [\cite=R8313].

These DAs contain eight hadronic parameters fN, λ1, λ2, Vd1, Au1, fd1, fd2 and fu1 which should be determined in the framework of various models. In further numerical calculations we consider three different sets of these parameters:

QCD sum rules based DAs, in which the parameters are determined from QCD sum rules (set 1) having the values Au1  =  0.38  ∓  0.15, Vd1  =  0.23  ∓  0.03, fd1  =  0.40  ∓  0.05, fd2  =  0.22  ∓  0.05, fu1  =  0.07  ∓  0.05.

A model for nucleon DAs (set 2) in which the above-mentioned parameters are chosen in such a way that the form of nucleon DAs describe well the existing experimental data on nucleon form factors (see [\cite=R8313]), whose numerical values are Au1  =  1 / 4, Vd1  =  13 / 42 and the values of fd1, fd2 and fu1 are the same as in set 1.

Asymptotic forms of DAs of all twists (set 3) in which the values of the parameters are set to Au1  =  0, Vd1  =  1 / 3, fd1  =  3 / 10, fd2  =  4 / 15, fu1  =  1 / 10.

Note that the values of fN, λ1 and λ2 for these three sets are the same, i.e., fN  =  (5.0  ∓  0.5)  ×  10- 3 ~ GeV2, λ1  =    -  (2.7  ∓  0.9)  ×  10- 2 ~ GeV2 and λ2  =  (5.4  ∓  1.9)  ×  10- 2 ~ GeV2.

The values of the non-perturbative parameters entering to DAs at μ = 1 ~ GeV scale are given in [\cite=R8309] and [\cite=R8313]. Sum rules for the form factors involve three unphysical parameters, namely, continuum threshold s0, Borel parameter M2 and the parameter β in the interpolating current of nucleon. Of course, if we can perform OPE up to infinite order, the result must be independent of these parameters. But we truncated OPE in the finite order, and hence, there appears dependence of sum rules on these auxiliary parameters. However, any physical quantity can not depend on unphysical parameters. Therefore, in the first hand, we should find the appropriate regions of unphysical parameters where form factors are independent on them. From an analysis of mass sum rules it follows that, when continuum threshold s0 lies in the region 2 ~ GeV2  ≤  s0  ≤  2.5 ~ GeV2, the prediction of sum rules on the mass of the baryons are practically independent of s0. It is this region of s0 which we will use in our numerical calculations.

Having determined s0, we next try to find a region (the so called working region) of M2 where the above-mentioned form factors are independent of M2 at fixed values of s0 and β. We study the dependence of the form factors induced by the axial-vector current on M2 at fixed values of Q2 and β at s0 = 2.0 ~ GeV2 and s0 = 2.5 ~ GeV2, for three different sets of the wave functions. We obtain that the results are almost the same for both choices of s0.

An upper bound for the Borel parameter M2 is determined by requiring that the contribution of continuum be less compared to the continuum subtracted sum rules. Lower limit is determined from the condition that the contribution of the term with highest power of 1 / M2 is less, say 30%, compared to the higher powers of M2 term contribution. Using these constraints we found that the working region of M2 is 1 ~ GeV2  ≤  M2  ≤  2.5 ~ GeV2, and we obtain that the results are rather stable with respect to the variations of M2, when M2 lies in the above-mentioned working region. It is also observed that the results of for the form factors depend also on the parameter β. But, as has already been mentioned, the parameter β is an auxiliary quantity and therefore the form factors must be independent of it. As a result of this argument, we need to find a region for β, where the results for the form factors are independent of its value. Analyses of mass sum rules [\cite=R8319] and meson-octet baryon couplings [\cite=R8320] lead to the result β <  - 1.3 and β > 3.3. In our numerical calculations we will use these bounds for β. It should be noted here that the Monte Carlo analysis of mass sum rules for baryons [\cite=R8321] predicts an optimal value β≃ - 1.2, which is close to our choice of lower bound.

The correlation functions can be calculated in QCD for sufficiently large negative values of Q2 and (p - q)2 using OPE. The form factors can reliably be determined at the range Q2  ≥  2 ~ GeV2. Our approach is not applicable for smaller values of Q2. For this reason, the form factors are evaluated in the range Q2  ≥  2 ~ GeV2. We study the dependence of the form factors on Q2 at fixed values of β, lying within the above-mentioned working region, at fixed values of M2 = 2 ~ GeV2 and s0 = 2.25 ~ GeV2, for the three sets of DAs.

From numerical analysis we obtain the following results:

The form factors GA(Q2) and GP(Q2) exhibit practically the same Q2 dependence for all three sets of the nucleon DAs.

The values of the form factor GA(Q2) almost coincide at negative values of β for the second and third set of DAs, while it differs about 50% at β =  - 1.4 and 15% at β =  - 5, for the first set of DAs. For the positive values of β, GA(Q2) practically coincide for all three sets of DAs.

The values of GP(Q2) are very close to each other for all three sets of DAs.

The values of GSA(Q2) are very close to each other for the second and third sets of DAs, but it is larger about 50% for the first set of DAs at β =  - 1.4.

The difference between the values of GSP(Q2) is very small for all three sets.

We see that all form factors are negative (positive) at positive (negative) values of β.

For illustration, in Figs. (1)-(4) we present the dependencies of the form factors GA(Q2), GP(Q2), GSA(Q2) and GSP(Q2) on Q2 at several fixed values of β, including the results for β =  - 1 case.

As has already been noted, the axial form factor GA(Q2) is considered in [\cite=R8313], however the analytical results that are presented in that work and in ours should be different, since the considered structures are different. However, we see that our numerical results on GA(Q2) are close to that obtained in [\cite=R8313] at β =  - 1.

Note that for the analysis of the existing data from neutrino scattering experiments, form factor GA(Q2) is usually parametrized in the dipole form

[formula]

where gA = 1.2695  ∓  0.0029, which is determined from β decay [\cite=R8302]. The global average for mA extracted from neutrino scattering experiment is predicted to have the value mA = (1.026  ∓  0.021) ~ GeV in [\cite=R8322], while the value mA = (1.20  ∓  0.12) ~ GeV announced by the K2K collaboration is slightly larger [\cite=R8323].

In Figs. (5)-(10) we present the LCSR prediction for the axial form factor GA(Q2) normalized to G(d)A(Q2), for all three sets of DAs. Experimentally this ratio, i.e., GA(Q2) / G(d)A(Q2) should be close to 1. From these figures we see that the prediction for this ratio by LCSR is quite close to 1 at β =  - 1.4 for the first (third) set of DAs and for the choice of the mass mA = 1.0 ~ GeV (mA = 1.2 ~ GeV). The ratio R(Q2)  =  GA(Q2) / GdA(Q2) is close to 1 for the second set of DAs at β =  - 1 for the choice of the mass mA = 1.2 ~ GeV. But, as has already been noted, β should be different from - 1. Therefore we can conclude that the dipole form of the GA(Q2) describes well only the first set of DAs at β =  - 1. Our results on GA(Q2) are in close agreement with the chiral quark model [\cite=R8324] predictions and lattice results [\cite=R8325] at β =  - 1.4. The results for GA(Q2) for other values of β depart considerably from the lattice results.

It should be remembered that all available experimental data exists only at low Q2 region. But unfortunately, our approach can give reliable prediction about the form factors only at high Q2  ≥  2 ~ GeV2 region. Therefore direct comparison of our theoretical prediction on experimental result is impossible. Recently proposed experiment Minerva [\cite=R8326] would provide a precise determination of GA at Q2  <  2 ~ GeV2 and Q2  >  2 ~ GeV2. Another experiment using e + p  →  ν + n has been planned at JLAB [\cite=R8327], covering the range Q2  =  1  ÷  3 ~ GeV2. When the result of these experiments will become available, it will be possible to compare the theoretical and experimental results. As the final remark we would like to note that, for a more reliable prediction of the form factors, it is necessary to take into account the radiative αs corrections and the distribution amplitudes with four, five particles.

In conclusion, in this work we calculate the form factors of nucleons induced by isovector and isoscalar axial-vector currents in LCSR method using the general form of the nucleon interpolating current. In our calculations we use three different sets. The dependence of the form factor GA(Q2) on Q2 is compared with its dipole form parametrization which follows from the analysis of neutrino experiments. Our analysis show the results for GA(Q2) in LCSR, for the first set of DAs at β =  - 1.4, well describes the dipole form of GA(Q2).
