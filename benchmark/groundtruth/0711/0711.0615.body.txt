Introduction

The theory of electrodiffusion has its origin in the liquid-junction theory of Nernst and Planck [\cite=1]. It seeks to provide a macroscopic description of the transport of charged particles through material barriers. Applications abound, in particular, in the modelling of biological membranes [\cite=2]-[\cite=7] and in electrochemistry [\cite=8]. Schlögl [\cite=9] observed that it is convenient to partition the ions into m classes characterized by the same electric charge qj = q0νj, where q0 is the unit of charge and νj is a nonzero integral signed valency. The m-ion electrodiffusion model in steady régimes then reduces to the following system of m + 1 coupled first order ODEs [\cite=10]:

[formula]

where x is the coordinate normal to the planar boundaries, p is the electric field and nj is the number of ions with the same charge qj = q0νj. These variables are subject to the constraint [\cite=9]

[formula]

The system ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]) admits the first integral

[formula]

where K may be set to zero without loss of generality whenever [formula]. Note that certain boundary value problems indeed require that K be zero. Here, this constraint is not imposed and it is demonstrated in an algorithmic manner that the electrodiffusion model for m  ≤  4 admits solutions given in terms of Painlevé transcendents and elliptic functions. The Painlevé reduction obtained in [\cite=Bass] is retrieved as a particular case.

Single-valued solutions. A classical procedure

For nonlinear systems such as ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]), dependent on certain parameters νi,ci, there is a classical method [\cite=PaiBSMF] for determining all those parameters for which the general solution of the nonlinear system is single-valued around its movable singularities. An alternative approach due to Kowalevski [\cite=Kowa1889] and Gambier [\cite=GambierThese] is also available, and all the details which are sometimes missing in these classical authors can be found in [\cite=BureauMI] or in summer school lecture notes [\cite=Cargese1996Conte].

The main steps, to be performed in the sequel, are as follows:

A scaled version of the nonlinear system ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]) is introduced for new fields Ni(X),P(X), via the transformation (this is a particular α-transformation [\cite=PaiBSMF]),

[formula]

Thus the limit ε  →  0 generates

[formula]

This canonical system results from ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]) and ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_pFirstIntegral]) by setting ci = 0,K = 0 and is termed the simplified system, as opposed to the original complete system ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]). If the complete system has a single-valued general solution, it is necessary that the simplified system has a single-valued general solution.

Necessary conditions on the parameters νi for the general solution of the simplified system to be single-valued are determined. These conditions are shown to be sufficient for the problem at hand.

The necessary conditions on the parameters νi,ci for the general solution of the complete system to be single-valued are obtained and the corresponding PII and other reductions listed.

Constraints on the charges νi

The transformation ([\ref=eq_alpha_transformation]) implies that P(X) admits movable simple poles,

[formula]

A straightforward integration of ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p-simplified])[formula] reveals the leading order behaviour

[formula]

Here, the Ai are undetermined constants. Since the νi are assumed distinct (see ([\ref=eqRestriction])), the term in χ- 2 in ([\ref=eqsimplifiedSolutionLocal])[formula] can only be matched by exactly one of the terms involving χνiP0. Denoting j this matching index, this yields the desired value of P0,

[formula]

In view of the possible vanishing of the remaining constants Ai, the necessary condition that each Ni(X) be single-valued near X = X0 is not easy to enforce and hence we proceed directly with the other conditions.

An additional necessary condition is that the linearized version of the simplified system near the local behaviour ([\ref=eqsimplifiedSolutionLocal]) also has the property that its general solution is single-valued near X = X0. Since this linearized system is of Fuchsian type [\cite=Ince] near X = X0, it is necessary that all its Fuchs indices be integer. This condition is here readily enforced with knowledge of P0. Thus, let us introduce the function W by

[formula]

By construction, W has a simple zero near X = X0 (it can be chosen such that lim X  →  X0W / (X - X0)  =  1). The integration of the simplified system then reduces to the integration of a single ODE for W(X), namely

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the ki are arbitrary constants. Since lim X  →  X0W / (X - X0)  =  1, Laurent series in X - X0 are also Laurent series in W. The values of the Fuchs indices are directly read from ([\ref=eqBriotBouquetW]), and are given by

[formula]

Finally, since j can be arbitrarily chosen, the diophantine condition to be solved is

[formula]

The latter condition is restrictive and, using the shorthand notation ν1:ν2:ν3  =  a:b:c to indicate

[formula]

its only distinct solutions are

[formula]

The necessary condition ([\ref=eqDiophante]) is also proven to be sufficient. Thus, in the first order ODE ([\ref=eqBriotBouquetW]) for W(X), all the powers of W are integers between 0 and 4 for the values ([\ref=eqlistmnu]) so that this ODE belongs to the binomial type studied by Briot and Bouquet [\cite=PaiLecons] and its general solution W(X) is single-valued. The explicit expressions for P and Ni in terms of W prove the single-valuedness of the general solution of the simplified system ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p-simplified]). This completes the second step as set down in Section [\ref=sectionClassical].

Let us remark that the Fuchs indices ([\ref=eqpindices]) comprise a subset of { - 2, - 1,1,3,4,6}.

Constraints on the ci

The third step involves a well known test due to Kowalevski and Gambier. In view of the numerous possible dominant behaviours ([\ref=eqNiof_W]) of the ni, it proves convenient to eliminate the m variables ni to obtain the m-th order ODE obeyed by the electric field p(x). Thus, taking the derivative of ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p])2 m - 1 times, one generates a van der Monde system for the m variables ni, namely [\cite=10]

[formula]

In view of the constraint ([\ref=eqRestriction]), the solution ni of this system is unique. Thus, the question of single-valuedness of the general solution (ni,p) of the complete system ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]) reduces to that of p alone. The m-th order first-degree ODE for p(x) is defined by the determinant

[formula]

For the admissible values of m as set down in ([\ref=eqlistmnu]), one obtains [\cite=10]:

[formula]

with the notation

[formula]

The next set of necessary conditions arises when one investigates the existence of the m Laurent series (one for each chosen j) whose first term is (see ([\ref=eqleadingP]))

[formula]

The locations k at which arbitrary constants may appear in the series ([\ref=eqpLaurent]) are identical to the Fuchs indices listed in ([\ref=eqpindices]).

Whenever k reaches one of the positive Fuchs indices in the list ([\ref=eqpindices]), to eliminate the possibility of a movable logarithm in the expansion ([\ref=eqpLaurent]) destructive of the Painlevé property, conditions must be imposed on the [formula] The results of this classical computation are (Appendix):

[formula]

The value K of the first integral is unconstrained.

Whenever - 2 is a Fuchs index of some family, movable logarithms may occur as well from this index - 2, but the classical computation recalled in the Appendix cannot detect them. In order to perform this detection, an analysis up to the perturbation order n = 6 has been conducted in the manner described in [\cite=13]. All such additional necessary conditions turn out to be identically satisfied.

In order to complete the third step, it remains to examine whether the general solution (ni,p) of the complete system is indeed single-valued for the cases set down in ([\ref=eqPositiveLog]). It proves convenient to make use of one of the m variables w involved in the singular part transformation (see ([\ref=eqspt])),

[formula]

namely the one where |νj| is the greatest of the m charges. To each vanishing ci, if any, there corresponds a first integral

[formula]

where the exponent 2νi  /  νj is an integer. For each pair (ci,ck) with ci  =  ck = 0 one can eliminate w between the two associated first integrals to obtain a first integral rational in (ni,nk), namely

[formula]

The m-ion cases: [formula]

m = 1

In this single ion case,

[formula]

where w satisfies the Airy-type equation [\cite=Fan],

[formula]

m = 2

Here, the ni,  i = 1,2 are given by

[formula]

and the second order ODE for p(x) has degree one in p''. All such second order ordinary differential equations which have the Painlevé property have been classified by Painlevé [\cite=PaiBSMF] and Gambier [\cite=15].

The first case

[formula]

belongs to Class 10 of Gambier and its general solution is elliptic with

[formula]

The second case

[formula]

may be reduced to the Painlevé II equation

[formula]

under the scaling transformation

[formula]

The third case

[formula]

belongs to Class 5 of Gambier and is linearizable with

[formula]

m = 3

The three cases to be considered are:

[formula]

The class of equations to which the ODE ([\ref=eqode_p_orders1234])3 belongs, namely

[formula]

has been investigated in [\cite=ChazyThese]-[\cite=KessiAdjabiOrder3Deg1], but the results therein are insufficient to cover the above three cases. For C = K = 0, the integration by elliptic functions (see ([\ref=eqBriotBouquetW])) was known to Chazy [\cite=ChazyThese]. For arbitrary values of C and K, we proceed directly with the original system ([\ref=eqSystem_ni_p]).

In the first case, two ci vanish, so that p obeys a second order ODE and a birational transformation exists between p and w2 with

[formula]

The ODE for w belongs to Class 34 of Gambier and its general solution is an algebraic transform of the PII function U ([\ref=eqPII]) with

[formula]

In the second case, since only one of the ci vanishes, the ODE for w is of third order and a birational transformation links p and w with

[formula]

The ODE for w belongs to Class XIII of Chazy [\cite=ChazyThese] and admits the first integral

[formula]

This second order ODE for w again belongs to Class 34 of Gambier and it may be integrated in terms of the PII function U with

[formula]

The third case, for which again two ci vanish, follows the same pattern as the first case and we have

[formula]

so that a PII equation is obtained for w.

It is remarked that, in the three cases considered above, the first integral of the third order ODE ([\ref=eqode_p_orders1234])3 for p is a polynomial of third degree in p''. This underlines the advantage in proceeding with w rather than p in our analysis.

m  =  4

In the unique case to be integrated,

[formula]

the four first integrals immediately yield the solution,

[formula]

so that w in general is an elliptic function.

The case when m is arbitrary and all the ci's vanish is similarly reduced to a first order ODE integrable by a quadrature, however with a multi-valued solution when m > 4.

Conclusion

The analysis presented here has been used to isolate, in particular, underlying Painlevé II structure in the 3-ion electrodiffusion model. This has potential application to the construction of upper and lower solutions to two-point boundary value problems [\cite=19]. The integrable nature of the model in these cases also allows the application of Bäcklund transformations [\cite=20].

Appendix. Conditions for the absence of movable logarithms

After the coefficient p0 of the series ([\ref=eqpLaurent]) has been computed, the recurrence relation for subsequent pk, namely

[formula]

depends linearly on pk and nonlinearly on the previously computed coefficients pl. Whenever the positive integer k is a Fuchs index r of the m-th order ODE ([\ref=eqode_p_orderm]), the coefficient P(r) vanishes and the condition Qr = 0 must be enforced in order to avoid movable logarithms. For the cases isolated in ([\ref=eqlistmnu]) and for each of the m families p0 =  - 2 / νj, these conditions Qr = 0 deliver the following.

m = 2:

[formula]

m = 3:

[formula]

m = 4: ν1:ν2:ν3:ν4  =  1: - 2: - 1:2,

[formula]

Since the coefficient p1 must remain arbitrary, this leads to the list ([\ref=eqPositiveLog]).
