Photoionization accompanied by excitation at intermediate photon energies

Introduction

Atomic photoionization accompanied by excitation and double photoionization are much studied in experimental and theoretical works in connection with many-electron problem. In the case of two-electron systems which is considered in the present paper, the three-body Coulomb problem is the subject of investigation.

Most attention in experimental studies was focused on the process of double photoionization. Photoionization with additional excitation have not been investigated in detail. Energy dependence of the cross section ratios in a broad interval of the photon energies ω, dependence of these ratios on the value of nuclear charge Z, branching ratios for excitations of [formula] subshells of a shell with the principle quantum number n are still the subjects of future experiments. As it stands now, there are experimental data only for atomic helium. The intensity of excitation of n-th shell relative to the main photoline n = 1 was measured in [\cite=1] for the photon energies up to several hundreds eV for the values of [formula]. A few measurements of 2s and 2p excitations at smaller values of the photon energies have been carried out earlier - see [\cite=1] for references.

Theoretical investigation of the process requires the knowledge of the wave functions describing two electrons in the field of the nucleus. In initial state both electrons are bound by the nucleus. In the final state one of the electrons belongs to continuum, while the second one is in excited bound state. Certain approximations (models) for the wave functions are required. Somewhat different approximations are reasonable in different regions of the photon energy ω.

We use the terminology which is similar to the one employed for much studied double photoionization [\cite=MG]. It is known that the ratios

[formula]

of the cross sections σ+  *n(ω) for ionization with excitation of the second electron to the n-th level, to those without excitation σ1(ω) do not depend on the photon energy in high energy limit [\cite=3] [\cite=DS]

[formula]

for ω  →    ∞  . This requires anyway that ω exceeds strongly the values of single-particle ionization potentials I

[formula]

Analysis of [\cite=3] [\cite=DS] have been carried out by employing the nonrelativistic functions for description of the outgoing electrons. It was shown in [\cite=DK] that asymptotics of the ratio R(ω) remains the same in the whole region (3) including the photon energies corresponding to relativistic outgoing electrons. Recall that this is not true for the double-to-single photoionization ratios [\cite=AD].

By high energies we mean that part of the region (3) where the ratios exhibit behavior described by Eq. (2). At low energies the ratio I / ω cannot be treated as a small parameter. By intermediate energies we mean the values of the photon energies, where inequality (3) is true, while deviations of the cross section ratios from the high energy limit are noticeable (with the relative deviations exceeding 10 percent). For atomic helium this is the region from 300-400 eV till 2 keV. In the systems bound by the nucleus with the charge Z the limits of the interval are proportional to Z2.

Since the ionization with excitation is a three-body problem, certain approximated wave functions for both initial and final states are required. It was shown in [\cite=3] and [\cite=DS] that in the high energy limit the final state interactions (FSI) between the electrons can be neglected. This simplifies the problem of the description of the final state (under a proper choice of gauge of gauge interactions of the outgoing electron with the nucleus can be neglected as well). In [\cite=3] the high energy limit of the process was expressed in terms of the initial state wave function Ψi(1,2). The high energy limits of the ratios Rn for atomic helium were calculated in [\cite=Br] [\cite=Ab] and dependence on the choice of the approximate function Ψi was traced. The calculations of [\cite=AD] include also the Z dependence of the high energy limits of Rn. Results of the high energy calculations for Li+ are presented in [\cite=SD] and [\cite=AM].

At low energies there is no small parameter. All the interactions involved should be treated as accurately as possible. In this energy region one must make a choice of both initial and final state wave functions. The low energy calculations of the cross sections σ+  *n(ω) have been carried out in [\cite=IB2] [\cite=PR1] for He and in [\cite=IB2] [\cite=PR2] for Li+. The paper [\cite=PR2] contains also results for partial cross sections [formula] of ionization accompanied by excitation of the remaining bound electron to the subshells with quantum numbers n and [formula]. Low energy calculations for the two-electron ions with larger values of Z were carried out in [\cite=IB2].

In the papers [\cite=IB1] [\cite=IB2] the intermediate energy region was approached by extension of the low energy calculations to this energy interval. In the present paper we move from the high energy region by including next to leading order of expansion in powers of ω- 1. This is achieved by inclusion of the interaction between the final state electrons in the lowest order of perturbation theory

We find several attractive points in such approach. It provides the possibility to clarify the role of various mechanisms (in a fixed form of electron-photon interactions) representing their contributions in terms of certain characteristics of the initial wave function. Within the framework of the approach one can estimate the magnitude of the neglected terms, thus controlling the accuracy. At the lower limit of the intermediate energy region numerical calculations with certain models for the final state wave functions are more precise. The discrepancy between the results obtained in numerical and perturbative approaches should diminish as ω increases. Hence these two approaches should supplement each other. Similar analysis of the intermediate energy double photoionization have been carried out earlier [\cite=DT].

We expect the approach developed in the present paper to be useful also because of certain discrepancies between experimental data for helium [\cite=1] and theoretical results. The high energy limit of the ratio Rn extrapolated from the data obtained in [\cite=1] is in perfect agreement with the calculated one only for n = 2. The disagreement increases with n reaching a factor of about 2 for n = 5. There is also visible disagreement between theoretical and experimental results for Rn(ω) at [formula]eV for n = 2,4,5 [\cite=IB1] [\cite=IB2]. Note also that in the case of helium there is a discrepancy between the calculations employing various approaches (see, e.g. [\cite=IB1] and [\cite=IB2]). Moving from the high energy region can be instructive also since (as noted in [\cite=IB2]) the R matrix approach, widely used in the low energy calculations becomes unstable at the high energies. Finally, studies of Z dependence of the ratios Rn may be of interest in connection with increasing attention devoted to physics of the multicharged ions.

We calculate ratios (1) of photoionization accompanied by excitation of the residual ion for helium atom and light heliumlike positive ions. We obtain also more detailed characteristics

[formula]

Such ratios are also detected in the low energy experiments [\cite=W]. The ratios defined by Eq. (1) can be represented as

[formula]

In this paper the calculations are carried out with inclusion of next-to-leading order terms of expansion of the ratios (1) in powers of ω- 1. This means that for ns states we calculate the high energy limits of the ratios (1) and the correction of the order 1 / ω. For [formula] states with [formula] we obtain the leading order of expansion in 1 / ω.

In the limit (3) all the interactions of the outgoing electron can be treated perturbatively [\cite=3]. In the high energy limit of σ+  *n final state interactions (FSI) of the outgoing electron with the electron bound in the residual ion can be neglected. The excitation following photoionization is due to the specific correlation in initial state known as shake-up (SU). Only s states can be excited by this mechanism. Excitations of the states with nonzero values of angular momentum [formula] are quenched by a small factor of the order I / ω.

We can present the ratios (4) as

[formula]

(with I0 the electron binding energy in hydrogen) for [formula], while for [formula]

[formula]

In the atomic system of units used through the paper (e = m = , c = 137) I0 = 1 / 2.

The coefficients An and [formula] with [formula] do not depend on the photon energy, while we show that Bn0 contains a smooth dependence on ω. Now we can present the ratios Rn defined by Eq. (1) as

[formula]

In the SU mechanism the interactions of the outgoing electron with nucleus can be treated perturbatively [\cite=3]. Excited electrons can be described by the Coulomb field wave functions. Thus, all the specifics of this three-body problem is contained in the wave function of the initial state. The ionized electron approaches the nucleus at the distances which are much smaller than the size of the atom. The SU cross section is thus determined by initial state wave function Ψi(1,2) at electron-nucleus coalescence point, i.  e. by Ψi(1 = 0,2).

The SU probabilities depend on n in terms of the wave function and of momentum pn of the outgoing electron

[formula]

with εn being the energy of the outgoing electron. In the lowest order of expansion in powers of I / ω we can put

[formula]

The SU terms with this value of p determine the high energy limit of the ratios

[formula]

Now we consider three types of contribution beyond the high energy limit, in the same way as it was done in [\cite=DT] for the double photoionization. The kinematical corrections to SU ratios are caused by taking into account n dependence of momentum pn in the SU amplitudes. This provides the contributions to the terms Bn on the RHS of Eq. (5). Note that these corrections are proportional to the small parameter I / ω, containing also dependence on specific parameter πξZ with

[formula]

One has to have in mind that corrections of the order πξZ  /  ω drop as ω- 3 / 2 but contain a numerically large coefficient. We shall not treat πξZ as a small parameter, but include it exactly. The dependence of the cross sections on πξZ known to be presented by the Stobbe factor S(πξ) =  exp (  -  πξ) which is common for the photoionization processes [\cite=5] [\cite=6]. These corrections are expressed in terms of SU contributions An to the ratios (5), which appear only in the ratios Rns.

In the next to leading order the excitation energy can be transferred to the second electron also by the initial state interactions (ISI) beyond the SU. In this case the terms of the order 1 / ω and Z2  /  ω come from the higher terms r21 / r22 and (12) / r22 of the expansion of initial state function Ψi(1,2) at [formula]. Thus the contribution will be presented in terms of the derivatives of the initial state wave function, integrated with the Coulomb field function of the bound state.

The excitation energy can be transferred also by the final state interactions (FSI) between the final state electrons. We include the FSI by perturbative method developed in [\cite=7]. The FSI amplitude is presented as power series of the Sommerfeld parameter of the interaction between the fast outgoing electron and that of the residual ion

[formula]

while v is their relative velocity. Thus, the square of the amplitude is presented as power series in ξ2 = 1 / 2ε with ε being the energy of the outgoing electron. Looking for the terms of the relative order ω- 1 in the cross sections, we must include the lowest correction of the order ξ2, putting

[formula]

The FSI contributions are presented in terms of matrix elements of relatively simple operators sandwiched by the function Ψi(1,2) and the Coulomb function of the electron in residual ion. The states with any angular momenta [formula] can be excited by the FSI in the next to leading order of ω- 1 expansion.

Thus, all the contributions up to the order ω- 1 will be presented in terms of certain characteristics of the initial state wave functions. We employ the functions obtained by Correlation Function Hyperspherical Harmonic Method (CFHHM), obtained in [\cite=8]. The CFHHM functions have been employed successfully for investigation of the parameters of the bound two-electron systems [\cite=9] and of some characteristics of the double photoionization. Also, the method of inclusion the FSI [\cite=7] enabled earlier to remove the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical results in creation of vacancies in electronic shells during nuclear transitions and in single photoionization of the p states. In [\cite=DT] it was used for investigation of the double photoionization at intermediate energies. In the present paper we use the CFHHM functions and the perturbative treatment of FSI for investigation of photoionization with excitation.

Note that for the system containing larger number of electrons the picture is more complicated. Considering ionization with excitation of the subshell with [formula] we find for ionization without excitations σ+  ~  ω- 9 / 2, while for ionization accompanied by excitation to an s state σ+  *  ~  ω- 7 / 2 (the ISI provides admixture of two s state electrons to the system containing two p state ones). Hence the corresponding ratio increases proportionally to ω.

Our analysis is completely nonrelativistic. We neglect the terms of the order ω / m in the wave function of the final state, and in the operator of the photon-electron interaction. The latter means that we are using the dipole approximation. We assume also (Z / 137)2  ≪  1, to neglect relativistic effects in the initial bound system.

General equations

The cross section of photoionization accompanied by excitation of the residual ion into a state with the quantum numbers [formula] can be written as

[formula]

Here Ii denotes the ionization potential of K electron in initial state atom. The factor 2 is due to two electrons in the K shell. The overline shows that the averaging over the photon polarizations have been carried out. The angular dependence of the amplitudes can be written explicitly due to the dipole approximation employed The amplitude

[formula]

with γ being the operator of interaction between the photon and an electron, while Ψ and [formula] describe the initial and final two-electron states, can be represented as

[formula]

After averaging over the photon polarizations one obtains

[formula]

If the FSI are neglected, the final state function is

[formula]

with the functions ψf and [formula] being just the continuum and bound state single-particle wave functions in the Coulomb field. If condition (3) is valid, the interactions of the outgoing electron with the nucleus can be included perturbatively. Using the velocity gauge for the operator γ, i.e.

[formula]

with [formula] standing for the photon polarization, we obtain the leading contribution of expansion in powers of p- 2 as coming from the plane waves. Following [\cite=DT] we can separate two scales in the interactions between the fast outgoing electron and the nucleus. Those taking place at small distances of the order p- 1  ≪  rc with rc = 1 / Z being the characteristic size of the atom are expressed in terms of the parameter πξ(n)Z (ξ(n)Z  =  Z / p(n). Such contributions can be calculated explicitly, producing the factor

[formula]

with [formula] being the normalization factor of the nonrelativistic Coulomb continuum wave function. The interactions which take place at the distances of the order r  ~  rc can be presented as p- 2 series thus cancelling in the ratios (1) and (2). Thus we can put

[formula]

Following [\cite=8] we present the factors N2(ξ(n)Z) in the cross sections as

[formula]

with the function h(ξ(n)Z) = 2πξ(n)Z / ( exp (πξ(n)Z)  +   exp (  -  πξ(n)Z)) containing only weak dependence on parameter πξ(n)Z. Thus we can put h(πξ(n)Z) = h(πξZ), with ξZ defined by Eq. (10). Hence,

[formula]

The second factor on the RHS of Eq. (21) is the Stobbe factor mentioned above.

We shall present the perturbative FSI contributions also in terms of the function (17). Thus the ratios (1) will be presented in terms of the matrix elements of initial state two-electron function and the Coulomb function of the excited electron.

Amplitudes beyond the shake-up

Following the analysis given above, we present the amplitudes for ionization with excitation beyond the SU as

[formula]

with [formula] standing for SU amplitude, which includes kinematical corrections to the high energy limit, while [formula] and [formula] are the contributions caused by correlations in ISI and FSI correspondingly.

Amplitudes without inclusion of final state interactions

Since in this subsection we neglect the interactions between the outgoing electrons, we can use Eq. (14) for the amplitude with the final state wave function presented by Eq. (17). Recall that we use the operator γ in the velocity form. This provides

[formula]

Here

[formula]

is the partial Fourier transform of the initial state wave function in variable 1.

Since the integral over r2 on the RHS of Eq. (23) is saturated at r2  ~  rc, while pn  ≫  r- 1c, we need expansion of the function [formula] in inverse powers of p2n. It is convenient to employ the Lippman-Schwinger equation

[formula]

The integral on the RHS is dominated by r  ~  p- 1n  ≪  r2. Thus the expansion in p- 2n can be carried out by expanding the function Ψ(,2) in powers of r in the integrand on the RHS of Eq. (25).

Shake-up with kinematical corrections

Presenting

[formula]

we obtain for the leading order contribution

[formula]

which enable to write for the SU amplitudes

[formula]

with

[formula]

while the upper index (r) in Eq. (28) labels the radial part of the Coulomb function ψn0. In the leading order we should neglect the dependence of pn on n, putting pn = p, just as in Eq. (8). The high energy limit of the amplitude (28) is thus

[formula]

In the next to leading term we must include the n dependence of pn. Since the residual ion contains only one electron, the latter is described by the Coulomb wave function, and thus

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the excitation energy of the electron in the final state ion.

Contributions of correlations in the initial state

Now we return to Eqs.(24), (25), looking for higher order terms of expansion of the function Ψi(,2) at r  →  0. Since the CFHHN functions are expressed in terms of variables r = ||,r2 = |2|,ρ = |  -  2|, we present the expansion in terms of the function Ψ(r,r2,ρ) = Ψi(,2)

[formula]

Here we put Ψ(r,r2,|  -  2|) = Ψ(0,r2,r2) after the derivatives are calculated. Using Eq. (33) we find that at small r

[formula]

Here τ = (  ·  2) / r  ·  r2. The derivatives Ψ'r and Ψ'ρ (and those of the second order) are taken at the points r = 0 and ρ = r2. The higher terms of expansion in r contribute to the higher order corrections in 1 / p to the amplitudes. Thus, they are neglected. While evaluating the next to leading order terms we must put pn = p.

Using Eqs. (26) and (34) we find nonzero contributions to the amplitudes with the angular momenta [formula] and [formula]. For excitation to s states we obtain

[formula]

with the upper index (r) labelling the radial part of the single-particle Coulomb field function as in Eq. (28). The function a(p) is determined by Eq. (29). Other notations are explained in the text below Eq. (26). For excitation into p states, choosing the direction of the outgoing electron momentum as the axis of quantization of the angular momentum, we obtain

[formula]

Thus interactions in the initial state provide corrections of the order p- 2 to the cross sections of excitations into s states. The dependence of the wave function on the interelectron distances ρ = |1  -  2|, which describes the electron correlations enables also excitations into p states. Excitation to the states with higher orbital momenta due to the ground state correlations only are still impossible.

Contribution of the final state interactions

Now we include the final state interactions. Following [\cite=7] [\cite=10] we present the final state wave function as

[formula]

with Φ(0) being the wave function (17), where the FSI have been neglected (here we omit lower indices), Vee is the electron-electron interactions, G is the propagator of the system of two non-interacting electrons in the Coulomb field of the nucleus. The second and third terms on the RHS of Eq. (37) correspond to one and two interactions between the final state electrons, thus being proportional to the powers of the parameter ξ defined by Eq. (11).

The two last terms on the RHS contain infrared divergent contributions caused by the Coulomb interactions Vee. It was shown in [\cite=7] that the infrared divergent terms cancel in each order of the expansion of the square of the amplitude |F|2. The situation is similar to that with the infrared singularities in the e - N scattering analyzed in [\cite=11]. The cancellation can be illustrated by assuming the electron interactions to be defined as [formula]. The contributions ln ν emerge in intermediate steps but vanish in the final expression for |F|2.

Explicit expressions which include the FSI in process with the fast outgoing electron up to the terms of the order ξ2 have been obtained in [\cite=7] [\cite=10]. The first order amplitude F(f1), corresponding to the second term on the RHS of Eq. (37) is mostly imaginary. The real part of F(f1) is suppressed by additional power of p- 1 and thus can be written as being proportional to ξ- 1. The second order amplitude is mostly real. Thus Im  F(f1)  ~  ξ, Re  F(f1)  ~  ξ2, Re  F(f2)  ~  ξ2, Im  F(f2)  ~  ξ3 (we do not trace the dependence on Z here). The FSI amplitudes can be presented as [\cite=7]

[formula]

Here [formula], is a function of r2 = |2|, z is the direction of the momentum of the outgoing electron. Recall that z axis is chosen for the quantization of angular momentum, r0 is the Bohr radius. Thus all the contributions to [formula] have nonzero values only for m = 0.

For s states both amplitudes Ff1 and Ff2 are important, since the terms containing the factor ξ2 interfere with the SU amplitude. For s states

[formula]

with

[formula]

For the states with [formula] there is no interference with the SU amplitude. Thus only the first term of the amplitude F(f1) is important. We can present

[formula]

with

[formula]

while

[formula]

and [formula] is the Legendre polynomial.

The ratios

Now we can calculate the cross sections and the ratios (1) and (4). The cross sections are related to the squares of the amplitudes |F|2 by Eqs. (13) and (16). We start with calculation of the values of |F|2.

Excitation of s states

Expressions for excitation of s states have the most complicated structure

[formula]

Here the first term on the RHS stands for SU contribution with account of kinematical corrections - Eqs. (28) and (29). The first term in the square

brackets comes from interference between SU and ISI amplitudes - Eqs. (30) and (35). The second term in brackets is caused by interference of SU amplitude presented by Eq. (30) with the first and second order FSI amplitudes presented by Eqs. (40) and (41). The last term in brackets is a purely FSI contribution.

In order to obtain contribution of the first term on the RHS of Eq. (45) to the ratio (1) we must include the n dependence of the phase volume in Eq. (13) for the cross section. As a result, for purely SU ratio we find

[formula]

with pn defined by Eq. (31). In the lowest order of expansion in powers of I / ω the dependence of RSUn on parameter πξZ is just the same as it would result in expansion of the RHS of Eq. (46) in powers of πξZ. However this is not true for the higher order terms of I / ω expansion.

The contribution of the other terms to the ratios Rn can be found as their ratios to squared amplitude of photoionization without excitation |F1s|2, where the corrections of the order I / ω also should be included. This gives

[formula]

The first term on the RHS is the high energy limit of the ratio. Note that Eq. (47) provides exact dependence on parameter πξZ in next to leading order of I / ω expansion. Expression in square brackets on the RHS of Eq. (47) should be identified with parameter Bn0 introduced by Eq. (5). Separating energy independent contributions and the terms, which depend on the photon energy through parameter πξZ we write

[formula]

with

[formula]

Excitation of p states

Excitations of the states with [formula] can take place only beyond the SU approximation. The contributions of ISI and FSI are expressed by Eq. (36) and by the first term in brackets on the RHS of Eq. (38) correspondingly.

[formula]

leading to

[formula]

Excitation of the states with [formula]

In this case only the FSI contribute. The amplitude is expressed by Eq. (43) giving

[formula]

with [formula] defined by Eq. (44).

Now we turn to analysis of particular cases.

The case of Helium

High energy limit

In Table I we compare our results for the high energy limits with those extrapolated from the experimental data [\cite=1] and with the results of previous calculations [\cite=Br] [\cite=SD] [\cite=IB1] [\cite=IB2]. There were also several publications of the high energy limit for R2s only. The pioneering calculation [\cite=16] provided R2s = 4.61  ·  10- 2 , while the latest available result is R2s = 4.79  ·  10- 2 [\cite=17].

One can see that various theoretical approaches provide very close values for high energy limits at [formula]. However the values of these limits extrapolated in [\cite=1] from the experimental data are in perfect agreement with the theoretical results only for n = 2. Discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results increases with n rapidly.

Beyond the high energy limit

Now we consider the contributions beyond the limit (9). Let us start with excitation of ns states. As we showed above, the contributions beyond the high energy limits come from kinematical corrections to the SU term and from the initial and final states electron-electron interactions. One can see from Table 2 that the FSI and ISI contributions are positive, with the FSI term being about 3 times larger than the ISI one for all values of n. The kinematical corrections are negative at μ > 1, corresponding to ω < 540  eV. At larger ω values they become positive. Their contribution to the parameter Bn0 defined by Eq. (5) does not exceed 10 percent for [formula]keV. They increase with ω, becoming as large as 25-30 % in the limit [formula] ([formula]eV). In this limit the FSI contribution determines about one half of the parameter Bn0. Note that the relative role of the three contributions does not vary much with n.

Contributions to excitation of p states come from FSI and ISI. Actually the former one dominates, providing more than 4/5 of the total contribution to Bn1. The result of calculations are presented in Table 3. One can see that Bn0 and Bn1 provide contributions of the same order of magnitude to the energy dependent part of the ratio Rn(ω) defined by Eqs. (1) and (7).

Thus the energy dependent parts of the ratios Rn(ω) determined by parameters Bn, are dominated by contributions of s and p states. The d states provide corrections of about 10%, while contributions of states with larger values of orbital momenta are negligibly small. The coefficients Bn are dominated by FSI which provide more than 70% of the values.

Excitation of the states with [formula] are due to FSI only. The cross sections of d states excitations are several times smaller than those of p states still providing noticeable contributions to parameter Bn (Eq. (71)) for [formula]. The relative role of excitation of d states slowly increases with increasing n - see Table 3. Excitation of states with higher values of [formula] drops rapidly with increasing of [formula]. For example, the cross section for excitation of 4f state is about twenty times smaller than that of 4d state. The values of [formula] and Bn are presented in Table 3.

Energy dependence of the relative role of excitations to the states with [formula],expressed by the ratio [formula] is shown in Fig. 1.

The ratios Bn / An converge to certain limiting values while n increases. This is due to similar n- 3 behavior of both characteristics at large n.

Comparison with earlier results

Now we compare our result with experimental and theoretical data obtained by the others. In Fig. 2 we present the ratios Rn for [formula], calculated in the present work and measured in Ref. [\cite=1]. We show also the results of calculations carried out in [\cite=IB2], where the intermediate energy region was reached by moving from the low energies.

We see that for n = 2 our results are in good agreement with those of [\cite=1] [\cite=IB2] for [formula]eV. As expected, there are noticeable deviations from results of [\cite=1] [\cite=IB2] at smaller values of ω. We do not show the results of calculations for [formula]eV obtained in [\cite=TB] [\cite=17], which are also in good agreement with those of the present paper. For n = 3 we find a good agreement with experimental and theoretical results at all values of ω. For the cases n = 4 and n = 5 our results are close to those of [\cite=IB2], with both sets of the calculated values exceeding the experimental data at [formula]eV. For n = 6 the experimental results are available only for [formula]eV, where the accuracy of our approach is poor since [formula]. However the deviations between our results and experimental data is are not large for n = 6, as well as for the other values of n in this energy region.

Z dependence

High energy limit

It was shown in [\cite=AD] that the SU ratios An drop as Z- 2 at [formula]. The tendency is illustrated by the results of calculations for [formula] presented in Table 4. One can see that the convergence to Z- 2 law becomes better for larger values of n. In [\cite=19] Z dependence of high energy limits for double-to-single photoionization ratio was traced and presented as a Z- 1 series. We can write similar presentation for the ionization followed by excitation. Assuming that An can be approximated by two terms of the series one has

[formula]

The values of an and bn are given in Table 5. The convergence of Z- 1 series is faster than in the case of double photoionization [\cite=19]. Also, in contrast to the double photoionization case, the leading Z- 2 terms underestimate the values of the ratios. Note that in approach of [\cite=AD], where all the interactions between the electrons where treated perturbatively,

[formula]

with cn also presented in Table 5 (a numerical error was corrected in [\cite=AM]). As expected, our values of an are close to cn.

The results presented in Table 5 illustrate also the tendency to n- 3 behavior. The values of the product n3  ·  R(0)ns for n = 5 and n = 6 differ by 5% for Z = 2 and by 4% for Z = 10.

Beyond the high energy limits

In this case Eq. (3) can be written as

[formula]

In order to trace Z dependence of the characteristics, we consider the limit [formula]. Let us start with excitations of s-states. One can see that in Eqs. (48) and (49) the ratio [formula], while Qn / S1  ~  Z, Vn / Z  ~  Z, [formula], [formula]. Thus in Eq. (5) [formula], [formula]. Hence, we can present

[formula]

with rn0 = Bn0 / Z2An. Using Eqs. (48) and (49) we can write

[formula]

with rdn0 = dn / Z2An and

[formula]

In similar way we can present for [formula]

[formula]

with [formula], while parameters [formula] are introduced by Eq. (6).

For the cross section ratios Rn defined by Eq. (1) we present

[formula]

For illustration we present characteristics of the process for Z = 10. Interplay of the three types of contributions to the parameter Bn0 describing excitation of s states is shown in Table 6. As well as in the case Z = 2 the FSI provides the main contribution. However the domination is less pronounced than in the case of helium.

As one can see from Eq. (57), the ratios rfn0 do not depend on Z. Dependence of parameters [formula] and rn on Z is illustrated by the results presented in Table 7. The values of rdn for Z = 10 are somewhat larger than for Z = 2. This is mainly due to larger contribution for excitation of p states in the case Z = 10. On the other hand the role of excitation of d states becomes smaller - see Fig. 3. The ratio of rdn for Z = 2 and Z = 10 exhibits very weak dependence on n. The values of [formula] and rn converge to certain limiting values while n increases. This is due to similar n- 3 behavior of the parameters [formula] and An at large n.

To estimate the limiting behavior of the ratios Rn for [formula], note that the first term on the RHS of Eq. (7) for Rn depends on the nuclear charge as Z- 2. Since the values of rfn are several times smaller than rdn they can be neglected for [formula]. At these energies the second term contains only weak dependence on Z.

Summary

We have considered photoionization accompanied by excitation for helium atoms and positive two-electron ions. We focused on the case of intermediate photon energies, for which expansion of the amplitudes in powers of ω- 1 is possible, while account of the lowest term only is not sufficient. We included the final state interactions between the electrons in the lowest order of their Sommerfeld parameter. This enabled us to analyze the role of various mechanisms of transferring the excitation energy.

We calculated the ratios [formula] of the cross sections [formula] for ionization, accompanied by transition of the second electron to the bound state with quantum numbers [formula] to the cross section for ionization without excitations σ+10, and also found the sums [formula] - Eq. (41).

Following [\cite=DT], we separated three types of contributions beyond the high-energy limit. These are the kinematical correction to the shake-up (SU) terms, and the contributions describing the transfer of excitation energy by initial state and final state interactions (ISI and FSI correspondingly). The FSI were included by the perturbative approach developed in [\cite=7] and employed in [\cite=10]. This enabled us to extract the energy dependent factors, presenting the amplitudes in terms of the matrix elements containing the initial state wave functions. The latter have been obtained in [\cite=8] by Correlation Function Hyperspherical Harmonic Method. These functions were employed in atomic physics calculations earlier [\cite=9].

We carried out the calculations, taking into account the next-to-leading terms of expansion in powers of ξ2Z. The kinematical corrections to the SU terms depend also on the parameter πξZ. Dependence on this parameter was included exactly.

The cross sections for excitation of ns states have the most complicated structure. In this case we had to include kinematical corrections to SU terms. The ISI amplitudes are proportional to ξ2Z, and we included their interference with the SU amplitudes. The first and second order FSI amplitudes contain the factors iξ and ξ2. Thus we had to include the interference between SU and FSI amplitudes and a purely FSI term. All the corrections should be included in the expressions for ionization cross sections without excitation σ+10 as well. The cross section for excitation of p states was determined by ISI and FSI mechanism, with both amplitudes being proportional to iξ. Ionization accompanied by excitations to the state with [formula] took place only due to the FSI.

For the case of helium we found the values of the high energy limits for [formula] to be in agreement with those, calculated by the others - Table 1. For excitations of ns states we found the FSI to provide the largest contributions. Excitations of np and ns states, provide the contributions of the same order of magnitude to the energy dependent parts of the ratios Rn. Excitations of nd states determine a corrections of about 10% to Rn. Excitation of states with [formula] are negligibly small - Tables II and III. For the atomic helium we carried out detailed comparison with earlier experimental and theoretical results. We found good agreement at [formula]eV for n = 2 and even at smaller values of ω for the larger values of n - Fig. 2.

For larger Z we found approximate formula (53), which presents the high energy limits in the form of Z- 1 series, with the leading terms of expansion being consistent with the earlier results [\cite=AD] [\cite=AM]. Excitation of ns states beyond the high energy limit is still dominated by the FSI. The role of excitation of the states with [formula] increases, e. g. for Z = 10 transitions to np states provide the largest contribution to the energy dependent part of Rn. The role of excitation of nd states drops with Z. These results are illustrated by Table VII. In the limit [formula] the ratios Rn can be presented as the sums of two terms. The high energy limit term does not depend on ω, dropping with Z as Z- 2. The second term drops as ω- 1, varying with Z slowly.

For the case of helium, as well as for the ions with larger values of Z, the contribution of ISI to the ratios Rn is about 10%. Hence, the ratios Rn are determined by the kinematical corrections to SU and by the FSI.
