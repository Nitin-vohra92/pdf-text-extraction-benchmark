A short proof of a known relation for consecutive power sums

Introduction

Let

[formula]

It is well-known that Sn(m) is a polynomial in m of degree m + 1. In [\cite=1] it was obtained,probably, the most simple relation between Sn(m) and Sn - 1(m):

[formula]

where S*n - 1(m) is obtained by replacing in Sn - 1(m) the powers mj by [formula] Proof of ([\ref=1]) in [\cite=1] was rather long including a complicated induction.

In this note we give quite a different and short proof of ([\ref=1]) with help of the Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x) which are defined by the generating function

[formula]

There is an almost exhaustive bibliography of the Bernoulli polynomials and numbers at K.Dilcher and I.S.Slavutskii [\cite=2].

Proof of Relation

Using ([\ref=2]) for x = m + 1 and x = 0 we have

[formula]

or

[formula]

On the other hand we have as well

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, comparing ([\ref=3]) and ([\ref=4]) we conclude that for n  â‰¥  1

[formula]

Now to prove ([\ref=1]) let us first prove an identity close to ([\ref=1]) for the Bernoulli polynomials

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

[formula]

On the other hand, for the right hand side of ([\ref=6]) we have as in ([\ref=3])

[formula]

[formula]

Comparing ([\ref=7]) and ([\ref=8]) we obtain ([\ref=6]).

Now from ([\ref=5]) we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

and according to ([\ref=6]) and again ([\ref=5]) we find

[formula]

and ([\ref=1]) follows [formula].

Since [formula] then we have
