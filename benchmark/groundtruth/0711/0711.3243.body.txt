A quasi-local mass for 2-spheres with negative Gauss curvature

Introduction

In [\cite=LY1], Liu and Yau propose a definition of quasi-local mass for any smooth spacelike, topological 2-sphere with positive Gauss curvature. In particular, Liu and Yau [\cite=LY1] [\cite=LY2] are able to use Shi-Tam's result [\cite=ST1] to prove its positivity. When the Gauss curvature of a 2-sphere is allowed to be negative, Wang and Yau [\cite=WY] use Pogorelov's result [\cite=P] to embed the 2-sphere into the hyperbolic space to generalize Liu-Yau's definition, and prove its positivity by using a spinor argument of the positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds [\cite=W] [\cite=CH] [\cite=Z1]. Wang-Yau's result is improved in certain sense by Shi and Tam [\cite=ST2].

In attempting to resolve the decreasing monotonicity of Brown-York's quasi-local mass [\cite=BY1] [\cite=BY2], the author [\cite=Z2] propose a new quasi-local mass and prove its positivity essentially for 2-spheres with positive Gauss curvature. It is still open when the 2-spheres have nonnegative Gauss curvature because the isometric embedding into [formula] in this case is only proved to be C1,1 by Guan-Li and Hong-Zuily [\cite=GL] [\cite=HZ]. However, we expect the C1,1 regularity is sufficient for our propose, and we address it elsewhere.

In this note, we use the idea of Wang and Yau to extend the quasi-local mass in [\cite=Z2] to the case of 2-spheres with negative Gauss curvature. We embed such 2-spheres into the (spacelike) hyperbola in the Minkowski spacetime which has the nontrivial second fundamental form. By using the constant spinors in the Minkowski spacetime, we can solve a boundary problem for the Dirac-Witten equation. Then, the method in [\cite=Z2] gives rise to the quasi-local mass as well as its positivity. We would like to point out that our quasi-local mass is only one quantity, while the one defined by Wang and Yau is a 4-vectors. This difference is due to the hyperbola in our approach goes to null infinity in the Minkowski spacetime, and the one in Wang-Yau's approach goes to spatial infinity in the Anti-de Sitter spacetime, which has trivial second fundamental form. The positive mass theorem near null infinity in asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes was established in [\cite=Z1] [\cite=Z1-1].

Dirac-Witten equations

In this section, we will review the existences of the Dirac-Witten equations proved in [\cite=Z2]. Let [formula] be a 4-dimensional spacetime which satisfies the Einstein fields equations. Let (M,g,p) be a smooth initial data set. Fix a point p∈M and an orthonormal basis {eα} of TpN with e0 future-time-directed normal to M and ei tangent to M (1  ≤  i  ≤  3).

Denote by [formula] the (local) spinor bundle of N. It exists globally over M and is called the hypersurface spinor bundle of M. Let [formula] and [formula] be the Levi-Civita connections of [formula] and g respectively, the same symbols are used to denote their lifts to the hypersurface spinor bundle. There exists a Hermitian inner product (  ,  ) on [formula] along M which is compatible with the spin connection [formula]. The Clifford multiplication of any vector [formula] of N is symmetric with respect to this inner product. However, this inner product is not positive definite and there exists a positive definite Hermitian inner product defined by 〈  ,  〉  =  (e0  ·    ,  ) on [formula] along M.

Define the second fundamental form of the initial data set [formula]. Suppose that M has boundary Σ which has finitely many connected components [formula], each of which is a topological 2-sphere, endowed with its induced Riemannian and spin structures. Fix a point p∈Σ and an orthonormal basis {ei} of TpM with er = e1 outward normal to Σ and ea tangent to Σ for 2  ≤  a  ≤  3. Let [formula] be the second fundamental form of Σ. Let H  =  tr(h) be its mean curvature. Σ is a future/past apparent horizon if

[formula]

holds on Σ. When Σ has multi-components, we require that ([\ref=horizon]) holds (with the same sign) on each Σi. The spin connection has the following relation

[formula]

The Dirac-Witten operator along M is defined by [formula]. The Dirac operator of M but acting on [formula] is defined by [formula]. Denote by [formula] the lift of the Levi-Civita connection of Σ to the spinor bundle [formula]. Let [formula] be the Dirac operator of Σ but acting on [formula]. The Weitzenböck type formula gives rise to

[formula]

where [formula]. If the spacetime satisfies the dominant energy condition, then T is a nonnegative operator. Let

[formula]

be the projective operators on [formula]. In [\cite=Z2], we prove the following existences:

If trg(p)  ≥  0 and Σ is a past apparent horizon, then the following Dirac-Witten equation has a unique smooth solution [formula]

[formula]

for any given [formula] and for fixed i0;

If trg(p)  ≤  0 and Σ is a future apparent horizon, then the following Dirac-Witten equation has a unique smooth solution [formula]

[formula]

for any given [formula] and for fixed i0.

Embedding 2-spheres

Let (M,g,p) be a smooth initial data set where M has boundary Σ which has finitely many connected components [formula], each of which is a topological 2-sphere. Suppose that some Σi0 can be smoothly isometrically embedded into a smooth spacelike hypersurface [formula] in the Minkowski spacetime [formula] and denote by [formula] the isometric embedding. Let [formula] be the image of Σi0 under the map [formula]. Let [formula] the unit vector outward normal to [formula] and [formula], [formula] are the second fundamental form, the mean curvature of [formula] respectively. Denote by [formula], [formula] the pullbacks to Σ.

The isometric embedding [formula] also induces an isometry between the (intrinsic) spinor bundles of Σi0 and [formula] together with their Dirac operators which are isomorphic to er  ·  D and [formula] respectively. This isometry can be extended to an isometry over the complex 2-dimensional sub-bundles of their hypersurface spinor bundles. Denote by [formula] this sub-bundle of [formula]. Let [formula] be a constant section of [formula] and denote [formula]. Denote by [formula] the set of all these constant spinors [formula] with the unit norm. This set is isometric to S3.

Let [formula] be the (induced) Dirac operator on [formula] which acts on the hypersurface spinor bundle [formula] of [formula]. Let [formula] be the covariant constant spinor of the trivial spinor bundle on [formula] with unit norm taking by the positive Hermitian metric on [formula]. Then ([\ref=two-conn3]) implies

[formula]

over [formula]. Pullback to Σi0, we obtain

[formula]

over Σi0. Denote φ±0  =  P±φ0. Since [formula] ([\ref=Hp]) gives rise to

[formula]

Therefore, using

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

In this paper, we introduce the following conditions on M:

trg(p)  ≥  0, H|Σi  +  tr(p|Σi)  ≥  0 for all i;

trg(p)  ≤  0, H|Σi  -  tr(p|Σi)  ≥  0 for all i.

Let [formula] be a spacetime which satisfies the dominant energy condition. Let (M,g,p) be a smooth spacelike (orientable) hypersurface which has boundary Σ with finitely many multi-components Σi, each of which is a topological sphere. Suppose that Σi0 can be smoothly isometrically embedded into some spacelike hypersurface [formula] in the Minkowski spacetime [formula]. Let [formula] be the isometric embedding and let [formula] be the image of Σi0. Suppose either condition (i) holds and [formula] are past apparent horizons, i.e.,

[formula]

or condition (ii) holds and [formula] are future apparent horizons, i.e.,

[formula]

Let φ be the unique solution of ([\ref=existence1]) or ([\ref=existence2]) for some [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof : Assume condition (i) holds and [formula] are past apparent horizons. Let φ be the smooth solution of ([\ref=existence1]) with the prescribed φ0 on Σi0. Denote φ± = P±φ. Denote φ±0 = P±φ0. By the boundary condition, we have φ+  =  φ+0. Thus

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Moreover, that e0  ·  ea  ·  P±  =  P∓  ·  e0  ·  ea  ·   gives rise to

[formula]

Same argument is applied under condition (ii). We finally prove the lemma.

Quasi-local mass

Now we use the idea of Wang and Yau [\cite=WY] (see also [\cite=ST2]) to extend the definition of quasi-local mass in [\cite=Z2] to the case of 2-spheres with negative Gauss curvature.

We first review the definition for 2-spheres with nonnegative Gauss curvature in [\cite=Z2]: Suppose some Σi0 can be smoothly isometrically embedded into [formula] in the Minkowski spacetime [formula] and denote [formula] its image. (It exists if Σi0 has positive Gauss curvature.) In this case, [formula].

Let φ be the unique solution of ([\ref=existence1]) or ([\ref=existence2]) for some [formula]. Denote

[formula]

The quasi local mass of Σi0 is defined as

[formula]

If all Σi can be isometrically embedded into [formula] in the Minkowski spacetime [formula], we define the quasi local mass of Σ as

[formula]

If the mean curvature of [formula] is further nonnegative (it is true if Σi0 has positive Gauss curvature), we can prove the positivity of the quasi-local mass ([\ref=local-mass]) (Theorem 1 in [\cite=Z2]).

Now suppose some Σi0 has negative Gauss curvature and let

[formula]

(κ  >  0) where -  κ2 is the minimum of the Gauss curvature. (Here we must choose the minimum of the Gauss curvature instead of arbitrary lower bound, otherwise the quasi-local mass defined in the following way might depend on this arbitrary lower bound.) By [\cite=P] [\cite=CW], Σi0 can be smoothly isometrically embedded into the hyperbolic space [formula] with constant curvature -  κ2 as a convex surface which bounds a convex domain in [formula]. Let (t,x1,x2,x3) be the spacetime coordinates of [formula]. Then [formula] is one-fold of the spacelike hypersurfaces

[formula]

The induced metric of [formula] is

[formula]

It has the second fundamental form [formula] for the upper-fold {t > 0} and [formula] for the lower-fold {t < 0} with respect to the future-time-directed normal. Denote also [formula] its image.

Let φ be the unique solution of ([\ref=existence1]) or ([\ref=existence2]) for some [formula]. Denote

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is easy to see that tr(p0|Σi0) =   ±  2, thus

[formula]

Now we define the quasi local mass of Σi0 under conditions (i), (ii) which are introduced in the previous section.

If condition (i) holds, we embed Σi0 into upper-fold {t > 0}. Since [formula] is convex, we have

[formula]

If condition (ii) holds, we embed Σi0 into lower-fold {t < 0}. We have

[formula]

in this case.

The quasi local mass of Σi0 is defined as

[formula]

Note that it might have two different values via embedding to the upper-fold and to the lower-fold respectively when tr(p) = 0. However, since [formula], [formula], we have

[formula]

This implies [formula]. Hence [formula] is unique in this case. Furthurmore, ([\ref=local-mass-new]) approaches ([\ref=local-mass]) when κ  →  0.

If [formula] can be isometrically embedded into [formula] in the Minkowski spacetime [formula], and [formula] can be isometrically embedded into [formula] in the Minkowski spacetime [formula] respectively, we define the quasi local mass of Σ as

[formula]

Let [formula] be a spacetime which satisfies the dominant energy condition. Let (M,g,p) be a smooth initial data set with the boundary Σ which has finitely many multi-components Σi, each of which is topological 2-sphere. Suppose that some Σi0 has negative Gauss curvature and let KΣi0  ≥    -  κ2 (κ  >  0) where -  κ2 is the minimum of the Gauss curvature. If either condition (i) or condition (ii) holds, then

[formula];

that [formula] implies the energy-momentum of spacetime satisfies

[formula]

along M, where f is a real function, φ is the unique solution of ([\ref=existence1]) or ([\ref=existence2]) for some [formula].

Furthermore, if pij = 0, then [formula] implies that M is flat with connected boundary; if pij  =    ±  κgij, then [formula] implies that M has constant curvature -  κ2.

Proof : By Lemma [\ref=lemma], statements (1), (2) and the first part of statement (3) can be proved by the same argument as the proof of Theorem 1 in [\cite=Z2]. For the proof of the second part of the statement (3), the vanishing quasi local mass implies

[formula]

Since [formula], we find the M has constant Ricci curvature with the scalar curvature - 6κ2. Therefore M has constant curvature -  κ2 because the dimension is 3.
