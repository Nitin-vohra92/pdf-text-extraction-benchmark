A Constrained Nevanlinna-Pick Interpolation Problem

Introduction

The classic Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation result says that given n distinct points, [formula] in the open unit disk, [formula] and n complex numbers, [formula] and A > 0, then there exists an analytic function f on [formula] with f(zi) = wi for [formula] and [formula] if and only if the n  ×  n matrix,

[formula]

is positive semidefinite, where [formula]

In this paper we give two very different sets of necessary and sufficient conditions for the classical Nevanlinna-Pick problem with one additional constraint. Namely, that [formula] We define the algebra

[formula]

so that our constraint is simply the requirement that functions belong to this algebra.

Our main result is analogous to M.B. Abrahamse's [\cite=Ab] interpolation results for finitely connected domains. If R is a bounded domain in the complex plane whose boundary consisted of p + 1 disjoint analytic Jordan curves, then Abrahamse identified a family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces H2α(R) indexed by α in the p-torus [formula], with corresponding kernels Kα(z,w). He proved that if [formula] are n distinct points in R and [formula] are complex numbers, then there exists an analytic function f on R such that f(zi) = wi and sup {|f(z)|:z∈R}  ≤  A if and only if

[formula]

In a similar fashion, we identify a family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions on [formula], denoted [formula], indexed by points on the sphere in complex 2-space, |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. The corresponding kernels are given by

[formula]

We will prove that these kernel functions play a similar role for our constrained interpolation problem to the role played by Abrahamse's kernel functions for interpolation on finitely connected domains.

In Section [\ref=S:npint], we will prove the following theorem.

Let [formula] be distinct points in [formula], and let [formula] be complex numbers. Then there exists an analytic function f on [formula] with [formula] and [formula] such that f(zi) = wi for [formula] if and only if

[formula]

is positive semidefinite for all |α|2 + |β|2 = 1.

Note that the kernels Kα,β and Keiθα,eiθβ coincide. That is, this family of kernels is parameterized by the set of complex lines in [formula] The complex projective 2-sphere will be denoted by PS2. So in Theorem [\ref=thm1], it is sufficient to consider the kernels for [formula] for 0  ≤  r  ≤  1 and [formula]; and when r = 1, these kernels are all equal to the kernel for (1,0). This also shows that PS2 may be identified topologically with the real 2-sphere. Consequently, the conditions in Theorem [\ref=thm1] can be regarded as involving parameters indexed by a real 2-sphere.

This parameterization will be used in section [\ref=S:Cenv], where we want exactly one representative for each kernel in order to discuss representations of certain quotient algebras.

One can also prove an interpolation result for this situation that involves an existential quantifier. Given [formula], let [formula] denote the elementary Möbius transformation that sends λ to 0.

Let [formula] be distinct points in [formula], and let [formula] be in [formula]. Then there exists an analytic function f∈H∞1 with [formula] such that f(zi) = wi for [formula] if and only if there exists [formula] so that

[formula]

is positive semidefinite.

These theorems are also in a certain sense complementary. If one is "lucky" enough to have found a point λ such that the matrix of Theorem [\ref=thm3] is positive semidefinite, then one knows that an interpolating function exists. On the other hand, if one is "lucky" enough to find a pair (α,β) such that the corresponding matrix in Theorem [\ref=thm1] is not positive semidefinite, then one knows that the interpolation problem has no solution.

Abrahamse proves that the spaces H2α(R) in some sense parameterize all "nice" models for Hilbert spaces that are modules over the algebra H∞(R). His proof of the interpolation theorem over these finitely connected domains demonstrates why finding these models plays a central role. In a similar fashion, we prove that the spaces [formula] serve as models for the spaces which are modules over H∞1. In particular, in section 2, we prove the following analogue of the Beurling and Helson-Lowdenslager theorems:

Let M be a norm closed subspace of [formula] which is invariant for [formula], but is not invariant for [formula]. Then there exist α,β in [formula] with |α|2  +  |β|2 = 1 and α  ≠  0 and a unimodular function, J, such that [formula] When M is a subspace of [formula], J is an inner function.

Theorem [\ref=thm2] is a refinement of the analogue of Beurling's theorem that was obtained for this algebra in an earlier paper [\cite=PS].

There are several reasons for studying the function theory of the algebra H∞1. Agler and McCarthy[\cite=AMc2] introduced the study of the algebras H∞(V) of bounded, analytic functions on embedded disks. Consider the map [formula] defined by φ(z)  =  (z2,z3), and set [formula]. Then V is the intersection of an algebraic variety with the bidisk. This is a very simple example of the embedded disks studied by Agler-McCarthy. Moreover, the isometric homomorphism induced by composition [formula] can be easily seen to be an isometric isomorphism onto [formula] since both [formula] and φ*(H∞(V)) can be seen to be the unital subalgebra of [formula] generated by z2 and z3. This fact is also pointed out in [\cite=PS], and was one of the original motivations for obtaining a Beurling-type theorem for the algebra H∞1. The second reason is the work of Solazzo [\cite=So], who studied Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation with the additional constraint that all interpolating functions have equal values for some finite set of points, or, equivalently, for finite codimension subalgebras of [formula] consisting of the bounded, analytic functions that are constant on a given finite set. Thus, it was natural to extend this work by considering the simplest example of a subalgebra determined by a derivative condition.

In section 4, we use the interpolation results to obtain a distance formula. In section 5, we use C*-algebra techniques to prove the failure of the matrix-valued analogues of our interpolation results. In sections 6 and 7, we discuss two-point interpolation and attempt to compute the naturally induced pseudo-hyperbolic metric arising from our algebra. Section 8 contains a summary of open questions about interpolation for this algebra.

An Invariant Subspace Characterization

In [\cite=PS], the subspaces of the Hardy space H2 that are invariant under multiplication by the functions in the algebra H∞1 are characterized. We begin by giving a somewhat stronger version of this result with a new proof.

Given complex numbers α and β with |α|2  +  |β|2 = 1, we let H2α,β denote the codimension one subspace of H2,

[formula]

It is easily checked that H2α,β is invariant for H∞1. Also H2α,β  =  H2δ,γ if and only if the vectors (α,β) and (δ,γ) are scalar multiples of each other.

When α  ≠  0, it is easy to see that H2α,β is not invariant under multiplication by H∞. However when α  =  0, H2α,β  =  H20,1  =  zH2, which is invariant under multiplication by H∞.

Since these are subspaces of H2, they are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of analytic functions on [formula]. An orthonormal basis for H2α,β is given by [formula]. Hence the reproducing kernel for this space is given by

[formula]

When α  =  0, this simplifies to [formula]

We are now ready to prove:

Let [formula]. Observe that

[formula]

By the Helson-Lowdenslager Theorem, the invariant subspaces of H∞ have the form L2(E) for some measurable subset [formula] or JH2 for some unimodular function J.

If   =  L2(E), then   =  z2  =  M is invariant for H∞. Thus   =  JH2 for a unimodular function J. So JH2  ⊃  M  ⊃  z2JH2. Both containments must be strict, as M is not invariant for H∞. As z2 is codimension 2 in [formula], there is an (α,β) in the unit sphere of [formula] so that

[formula]

The last claim is immediate.

The Interpolation Theorem

In this section we present the proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=thm3].

Recall that if f is any measurable function on [formula], we can define the operator of multiplication by f from [formula] into the space of measurable functions. For a subspace such as H2α,β, the multipliers are those multiplication operators which map the space H2α,β into itself. A standard argument using the Closed Graph Theorem shows that such operators are always bounded. We denote these multiplier operators by Mf.

Let [formula] satisfy |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Then the algebra of multipliers of H2α,β is H∞1, and moreover [formula].

Let f  ·  H2α,β  ⊆  H2α,β. Since z2∈H2α,β it follows that z2f is analytic. So let [formula]. Observe that we must have f(z)(α  +  βz)∈H2α,β. Examining the coefficient of z- 2 yields that f- 2 = 0; and similarly f- 1 = 0. Equating the 0th and first order terms yields

[formula]

for some λ. Hence f0  =  λ, and f0β  +  f1α  =  λβ  =  f0β, which yields f1 = 0. Thus every multiplier is in H∞1. But we noted earlier that every element of H∞1 is a multiplier.

Finally, since z2H2  ⊆  H2α,β  ⊂  H2,

[formula]

We repeat the main theorem for the reader's convenience:

Now if f is a multiplier in any reproducing kernel Hilbert space with kernel K(x,y) and [formula] then for any set of points, [formula], we will have that [formula] is positive semidefinite. See, for example, [\cite=AM].

Thus, if there exists f∈H∞1 such that f(zi)  =  wi and [formula], then f will be a multiplier of each H2α,β space with multiplier norm [formula]. Hence

[formula]

This proves the necessity of the condition in Theorem [\ref=thm1]. The proof of sufficiency will follow from a factorization lemma similar to one used in [\cite=Ab].

Suppose that we are given a finite set [formula] of distinct points in [formula] Let IF denote the ideal of functions in H∞1 which vanish on the set F. Write BF for the finite Blaschke product with simple zeroes at the points of F; i.e. [formula]. Let (a,b) be a norm one multiple of (c0,c1).

When 0 is not in F, it is evident that

[formula]

where f0 is the product of BF with that linear function which multiplies it into H∞1. It is easy to see that f0  =  BF(a - bz). Therefore we conclude that

[formula]

where H∞α,β denotes those H∞ functions such that the vector (h(0),h'(0)) is a multiple of (α,β). When 0 belongs to F, write [formula]. Then BF  =  zBF' and

[formula]

So the same result holds.

The pre-annihilator of IF in [formula] is [formula].

Clearly [formula] is contained in

[formula]

and consists of those functions in this set which are orthogonal to f0. (In the case of 0∈F, f0  =  zBF, which is consistent.) We may write [formula] as [formula] where g0∈H1. Then calculate

[formula]

Therefore g0 belongs to H1a,b.

Define NFα,β to be the subspace of H2α,β consisting of those functions which vanish on F. Denote the orthogonal complement of NFα,β in H2α,β by MFα,β. This is n-dimensional, and evidently contains the kernel functions kα,βzi(z)  =  Kα,β(z,zi) for the points zi∈F. As they are linearly independent, these vectors span MFα,β.

For each [formula], there are scalars α  ≠  0 and β in [formula] so that g factors as [formula] where k∈H2α,β, [formula] is orthogonal to NFα,β, and [formula].

Conversely, every function [formula] which factors as [formula] where k∈H2α,β and [formula] is orthogonal to NFα,β belongs to [formula].

Write [formula] as before and factor g0  =  kh0 with

[formula]

where k,h0 are in H2 and k is outer. As [formula] is outer, k0  ≠  0. Set α  =  k0(|k0|2 + |k1|2)- 1 / 2 and β  =  k1(|k0|2 + |k1|2)- 1 / 2; so α  ≠  0 and k lies in H2α,β. Write [formula]; so that [formula]. It remains to verify the orthogonality condition.

Observe that H∞1k is dense in H2α,β because outer functions are cyclic vectors for H∞ in H2; whence

[formula]

Also note that [formula]. Indeed, the right hand side vanishes on F, and so is contained in NFα,β. However both evidently have codimension n  =  |F|; so they are equal. Thus a dense subset of NFα,β is given by IFk.

Therefore to check that h is orthogonal to NFα,β, take an arbitrary element f∈IF and calculate

[formula]

Reversing this calculation shows that every such product [formula] belongs to [formula].

We return to the proof of the main result.

It remains to be shown that if

[formula]

then there exists ψ∈H∞1 with [formula] and ψ(zi) = wi for [formula]

Since the algebra of polynomials satisfying [formula] separates points on the disk, we may choose a polynomial p with [formula] and p(zi) = wi for [formula]

For every (α,β), we have that [formula] Thus, MFα,β is invariant under M*p. As the functions kα,βzi span MFα,β, the positive semidefiniteness of the matrix above is equivalent to the condition

[formula]

which is equivalent to [formula].

Let [formula] denote the orthogonal projection.

Define a linear functional Φ on [formula] by [formula]. We claim that Φ has norm at most A. To see this, take any [formula] and factor it as [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=L:factor]. Since h is orthogonal to NFα,β, we see that Pα,β(h) = :h̃ lies in MFα,β. We compute

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Thus, by the Hahn-Banach Theorem, we may extend Φ to a linear functional on L1 of norm at most A. Since L∞ is the dual of L1, this means that there is a function f∈L∞ with [formula] such that [formula] for every g∈IFα,β. Therefore f  -  p belongs to [formula]. In particular, f∈H∞1 and f - p vanishes on F. So f(zi)  =  p(zi)  =  wi as desired.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3] is easier.

We first suppose that [formula]. Assume that f∈H∞1 exists satisfying [formula] and f(zi) = wi for [formula]. Set λ  =  f(0), which lies in [formula]; and let g(z)  =  φλ(f(z)). Then g belongs to H∞ and g'(0) = φλ'(f(0))f'(0)  =  0. So g∈H∞1. Evidently [formula], g(zi)  =  φλ(wi) for [formula] and g(0) = φλ(λ) = 0. Hence, g(z) = z2h(z) with [formula]

Therefore by the Nevanlinna-Pick Theorem applied to h and the set F,

[formula]

Consequently, [formula] equals

[formula]

and thus is positive semidefinite.

On the other hand, if, say z1 = 0, then λ = f(0) = f(z1) = w1 and the first row and column of the matrix above is zero; and the same reasoning applies to the remaining entries of the matrix.

Conversely, we again consider the case where [formula], and suppose that λ is given which provides a positive semidefinite matrix. By reversing the calculation, we see that the matrix,

[formula]

is positive semidefinite. Hence, by the Nevanlinna-Pick Theorem, there exists an analytic function h on [formula] with [formula] so that h(zi)  =  z- 2iφλ(wi). Set f(z)  =  φ-  λ(z2h(z)). Reversing the calculations of the first paragraph shows that f is the desired interpolant.

The case where 0∈F is handled similarly.

Distance Formulae

Donald Sarason introduced new operator theoretic methods for interpolation problems in his seminal paper [\cite=Sa]. In particular, he made critical use of the fact that the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem is equivalent to a distance estimate. In our context, we are searching for a function f∈H∞1 of minimal norm satisfying f(zi) = wi for zi∈F, [formula]. Letting p be a polynomial in H∞1 satisfying the interpolation data, it is easy to see that the optimal norm is precisely [formula]. The infimum is attained because IF is weak-*   closed.

The main theorem can be re-interpreted as the following.

Let F be a finite subset of [formula]. For any f∈H∞1,

[formula]

We compute [formula] using duality. By Lemmas [\ref=L:pre-ann] and [\ref=L:factor], we have

[formula]

We recover Theorem [\ref=thm1] by observing that [formula] if and only if

[formula]

Something special happens when F contains 0. In this case, IF  =  zBFH∞. This is an ideal of H∞ as well, so the distance to it can be computed using standard methods. Let Γh denote the Hankel operator [formula] where P is the projection onto H2. Using Nehari's Theorem,

[formula]

Therefore, we obtain:

Let [formula] be a finite subset of [formula] containing 0. Given data [formula] for [formula], the following are equivalent:

there is a function f in H∞1 such that f(zi)  =  wi for [formula] and [formula].

[formula]. i.e. [formula].

[formula].

[formula] is positive semidefinite.

We have already shown the equivalence of (1), (2) and (3). To obtain the equivalence of (3) and (4), we use the basis [formula] for [formula], where [formula] are the reproducing kernel functions for the Hardy space H2. Observe that since f∈H∞1, we have [formula]. The positivity of [formula] is equivalent to the positivity of the (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) matrix [formula] where k0 = 1, k1 = z and ki  =  kzi for [formula]. A simple computation shows that this is the matrix in the semidefinite condition (4).

It is interesting to reconcile this corollary with Theorem [\ref=T:dist_ideal]. Notice that when 0 is in F, that

[formula]

independent of (α,β). Therefore

[formula]

The special thing that occurs here is that the subspaces Mα,β have codimension 1 in the space [formula]. Moreover, any vector x in [formula] has the form x  =  c(α  +  βz)  +  z2h; and therefore lies in one of the subspaces MFα,β. Consequently, if [formula] achieves its norm at a vector x, and x∈MFα,β, then the same norm is achieved on the restriction M*f|MFα,β. That is, when 0∈F,

[formula]

In the case in which [formula], NFα,β contains z2BFH2 as a codimension 1 subspace. The subspaces MFα,β are codimension 2 in their joint span, not codimension 1. So the argument above does not apply.

The implications of this are explored in the discussion of C*-envelopes.

In the same vein as Theorem [\ref=T:dist_ideal], we can obtain an analogue of Nehari's Theorem: if f∈L∞, then [formula].

If f∈L∞, then

[formula]

We use a similar duality argument. The pre-annihilator of H∞1 in L1 is the closed span of H10 and [formula]; and this is equal to [formula]. This is just Lemma [\ref=L:pre-ann] for [formula]. Then Lemma [\ref=L:factor] shows that every g in [formula] factors as [formula] where [formula], k lies in some H2α,β and h is orthogonal to [formula]. Conversely, every product of this form lies in [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Matrix-Valued Interpolation and C*-envelopes

In the classical Nevanlinna-Pick problem, one can consider matrix valued interpolation. That is, one specifies points [formula] in the unit disk and k  ×  k matrices [formula] and asks for the optimal norm [formula] of a bounded analytic function f from [formula] into [formula] satisfying f(zi)  =  Wi. The norm of a function in [formula] is defined as the supremum over [formula] of the operator norm of the matrix f(z). It turns out that the same result holds, namely that there is such a function with [formula] if and only if the matrix [formula] is positive semidefinite.

The same matrix interpolation problem can be formulated for the space of multipliers of any reproducing kernel Hilbert space. When the positivity of the matrix [formula] is equivalent to interpolation, the kernel is called a complete Nevanlinna-Pick kernel. Such kernels have been characterized by Agler and McCarthy [\cite=AM3]. However, recognition of such kernels is generally not straightforward.

In our context of H∞1, the analogous problem is to ask whether the family of conditions

[formula]

is equivalent to matrix interpolation of the data by a function [formula] with [formula].

When the set consists of only two-points, the answer to such questions is always affirmative, for reasons that we shall discuss in section 7. However, for three or more points the problem is more difficult.

Recall that every unital operator algebra A imbeds completely isometrically into some C*-algebra. Moreover, among such C*-algebras which are generated by the range, there is a unique smallest one known as the C*-envelope, [formula], in the sense that: if j is a completely isometric isomorphism of A into a C*-algebra [formula], then there is an ideal [formula] of [formula] so that the quotient map q by [formula] is a complete isometry on j(A) and [formula] is *  -isomorphic to [formula]. See [\cite=Pau] for the necessary background.

One way to determine the complexity of the matrix interpolation problem is to compute the C*-envelope of the associated quotient algebra. This connection between interpolation and the C*-envelope has been studied and is further discussed in [\cite=McP] and [\cite=So]. In this section, we use the computation of a C*-envelope to show that for certain subsets of [formula], this matrix-valued analogue fails. To be precise, we will prove the following result.

There exists a set F = {z1,z2,z3} of three distinct non-zero points in [formula] an integer k and k  ×  k matrices W1,W2,W3 such that the 3  ×  3 block matrix [formula] is positive semidefinite for all |α|2  +  |β|2 = 1, but there does not exist a function [formula] with [formula] such that f(zi) = Wi for i = 1,2,3.

Our proof is indirect and, in particular, we are currently unable to explicitly exhibit a particular set of three points and the three matrices W1,W2,W3, which the above theorem asserts exist.

Let [formula] be a finite subset of [formula] and let [formula] belong to [formula]. Consider the problem of finding the optimal norm of a function [formula] satisfying f(zi)  =  Wi. Such functions always exist, even amongst polynomials. Let p be an arbitrary choice of an interpolant. As in the previous section, the matrix interpolation problem is equivalent to distance estimate. The optimal norm is [formula]. Because of this equivalence between distance and interpolation, we can re-interpret the above theorem in terms of distance formulae.

There exists a set F = {z1,z2,z3} of three distinct non-zero points in [formula] an integer k and a k  ×  k matrix-valued function [formula] such that

[formula]

It is likely that the matrix-valued analogue of [\ref=distform] is also false although we have not shown that here.

To prove the above theorem, we need to first reinterpret the results of the previous section. It is now important to use each kernel exactly once, so we use the parameterization by the projective complex 2-sphere PS2. But for convenience of notation, we still use (α,β) to represent a point in PS2.

Define a map ΦF from H∞1 into [formula] by

[formula]

We use the compression of Mf rather than the restriction of M*f so that our map is linear. The image is a continuous function because the map taking (α,β) to the projection PMFα,β is continuous. Clearly ker ΦF  =  IF. Therefore it induces a map F from H∞1  /  IF into [formula]. Theorem [\ref=T:dist_ideal] says that F is isometric.

For convenience, we write [formula]. When F contains 0, Corollary [\ref=C:dist0] provides a different map ΨF from H∞1 into [formula] given by

[formula]

Again this factors through the quotient by IF, and yields an isometric map Ψ̃F from H∞1  /  IF into [formula].

However, in this case, more is true. The map ΨF extends naturally to H∞, and we keep the same name for it. Since 0∈F, IF  =  zBFH∞. Therefore the injection of H∞1  /  IF into H∞ / zBFH∞ is completely isometric. The classical matrix Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation result is equivalent to saying that the map Ψ̃F is a complete isometry from H∞ / zBFH∞ into [formula]. A fortiori, the map Ψ̃F restricted to H∞1  /  IF is a complete isometry.

This will enable us to compute the C*-envelope of H∞1  /  IF in this case. Indeed, the algebra ΨF(H∞) is known to generate all of [formula] as a C*-algebra. Since [formula] is simple, it is the C*-envelope of H∞ / zBFH∞. Usually this is the case for H∞1 as well, with n = 2 being an exception.

Let F be a set of n distinct points in [formula] containing 0. If n  ≥  3, then [formula]. If n = 2, then [formula].

We first need a useful representation of ΨF(f). As in the proof of Corollary [\ref=C:dist0], we make use of the basis [formula] for K, and the fact that [formula], [formula] and [formula] for [formula], where f(zi) = wi. Thus ΨF(f)* is diagonal with respect to this non-orthogonal basis.

Let [formula] be the diagonal n   +   1  ×  n   +   1 matrix in [formula] with the first eigenvalue repeated a second time. It will be convenient to write the standard basis of [formula] as [formula]. Consider [formula] as a map from K into [formula]. Then Ψ(f)*  =  V- 1D*fV. Using polar decomposition, we may replace V with the map Q1 / 2 where

[formula]

Hence Ψ(f)*≃Q- 1 / 2D*fQ1 / 2; and so Ψ(f)≃Q1 / 2DfQ- 1 / 2. Therefore Ψ is unitarily equivalent to the map π(f)  =  Q1 / 2DfQ- 1 / 2.

Observe that H∞1  /  IF is generated by the n commuting idempotents which are cosets of functions fj satisfying fj(zi)  =  δij for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n. Write Eij, 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, for the matrix units in [formula]. The functions fj are mapped to π(f1)  =  Q1 / 2(E0,0 + E1,1)Q- 1 / 2 and π(fj)  =  Q1 / 2(Ej,j)Q- 1 / 2 for [formula].

Let [formula]. Then [formula] must contain the operators π(fj)*π(fj). Observe that

[formula]

and for [formula],

[formula]

where qjj  =  (1 - |zj|2)- 1 is the j,j entry of Q. In particular, [formula] contains

[formula]

Hence Q, Q1 / 2 and Q- 1 / 2 all belong to [formula].

Therefore E0,0 + E1,1 and Ej,j for [formula] belong to [formula]. In addition, EiiQEjj  =  qijEij is a non-zero multiple of Eij in [formula] for 2  ≤  i,j  ≤  n. And similarly, [formula] contains

[formula]

As long as n  ≥  3, we obtain E0j and E1j in [formula]. Therefore [formula] is all of [formula]. As this is a simple C*-algebra, it must be the C*-envelope.

Now consider n = 2. In this case [formula] is generated by

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then (1  +  |z2|2)- 1 / 2C is a rank 1 partial isometry, and [formula] is a copy of [formula] on the subspace [formula]; while E0: = D1  -  (1  +  |z2|2)- 1CC* spans a copy of [formula] on the complement [formula]. Since Q  =  D1  +  D2  +  C  +  C*, it is evident that these two subalgebras generate all of [formula]. So [formula].

To see that the C*-envelope is [formula] in this case, it suffices to show that the quotient map onto the [formula] summand is completely isometric on H∞1  /  IF. Let E1  =  D1  -  E0 and E2  =  D2, so that E0, E1 and E2 are diagonal matrix units compatible with the decomposition of [formula]. Observe that [formula] where Q1  =  (E2 + E3)Q(E2 + E3)|N. Hence [formula].

A typical element of [formula] has the form [formula] for matrices A1 and A2 in [formula]. Using the structure above, we calculate

[formula]

where P1 = P21 is idempotent and P2  =  I  -  P1. In order to show that the second summand always dominates the first in norm, it suffices to show that

[formula]

To see this, take a unit vector e in the range of P1 and a unit vector x such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

Therefore the quotient of [formula] onto [formula] is completely isometric on H∞1  /  IF; and hence [formula] is the C*-envelope.

Let F be a set of [formula] distinct points in [formula] containing 0. Then the isometric homomorphism [formula] is not completely isometric.

If F were a complete isometry, then there would be a *-homomorphism from the C*-subalgebra [formula] of [formula] generated by the range of F onto [formula] However, as [formula] is a subalgebra of [formula], every irreducible representation of [formula] is of dimension at most n. This contradiction leads to the conclusion that F is not a complete isometry.

Let [formula] be n distinct points in the disk and let [formula] be k  ×  k matrices. There exists a function [formula] with [formula] and f(zj) = Wj if and only if the matrix

[formula]

is positive semidefinite.

Now we use this result to deduce that matrix interpolation must fail for certain sets that do not contain 0.

Let [formula] be a set of distinct non-zero points in [formula]. As in the proof of the previous theorem, observe that ΦF(f)(α,β) is similar to the diagonal operator [formula] with respect to the non-orthogonal basis [formula]. The operator [formula] from MFα,β to [formula] implements the similarity via ΦF(f)(α,β)  =  V- 1α,βDfVα,β. As before, we define

[formula]

This is easily seen to be a continuous function from PS2 into [formula] such that ΦF is unitarily equivalent to the map

[formula]

Let n  ≥  3, and let [formula] be a set of distinct non-zero points in [formula] There exists r  >  0 so that if |z1|  ≤  r and [formula], then [formula] is not a complete isometry.

Assume otherwise. Then there would exist a sequence of points {z1(m)}∞m = 1 tending to 0 such that for each set [formula], the homomorphism [formula] is a complete isometry. Set [formula].

Let Qα,β(m) denote the matrix functions defined above for the set Fm; and let Qα,β denote the matrix function corresponding to F as before. By the continuity of the function Kα,β, as m tends to ∞  , the functions Qα,β(m) converge uniformly to Qα,β. Using continuity and compactness, one can see that there exists a δ > 0 such that Qα,β(m)  ≥  δIn, for all (α,β)∈PS2 and all [formula].

Suppose that [formula] are k  ×  k matrices satisfying

[formula]

We claim that there exist a sequence εm  →  0 such that

[formula]

for all (α,β)∈PS2 and all m  ≥  1. To see this, note that the difference between Δ(α,β) and [formula] is a sequence of Hermitian valued functions converging uniformly to 0. Thus, we may chose positive scalars εm  →  0 such that

[formula]

The claim follows.

This inequality implies that there exists functions [formula] with [formula] such that fm(zi(m))  =  Wi for [formula]. Taking a weak*-limit point of these functions yields a function [formula] with [formula] satisfying f(zi)  =  Wi for [formula].

This proves that [formula] is a complete isometry, contrary to Corollary [\ref=C:not_c.isom].

Theorem [\ref=T:fail_matrix] is now an immediate consequence.

A Modified Pseudo-Hyperbolic Metric

M. B. Abrahamse [\cite=Ab] proves that, in a certain sense, all of the kernels given by his parameters are necessary for his Nevanlinna-Pick type result. Further results about the necessity of all of Abrahamse's kernel conditions can be found in [\cite=FV], [\cite=Mc] and [\cite=McP]. We consider a similar problem for our kernels in this section and examine in detail the pseudo-hyperbolic metric on the disk induced by the algebra H∞1.

A uniform algebra A on a topological space X induces a metric on the space by setting

[formula]

Note that 0  ≤  dA(x,y)  ≤  1; and that dA(x,y) > 0 when x  ≠  y because A separates points. It is an elementary exercise with Möbius maps to show that dA(x,y)  =  dA(y,x), and that this distance is comparable to the usual metric induced on X considered as a subset of A*. This second distance is given by [formula], where δx denotes the point evaluation δx(f) = f(x). Moreover, it is a standard exercise to show that

[formula]

From this, one can deduce that

[formula]

The triangle inequality is evident now, as is the fact that dA(x,y)  <  1 is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called Gleason parts. See [\cite=Bear] for this material and its consequences.

The best known example of this construction is the pseudohyperbolic metric, which is the metric on [formula] induced by H∞. This metric is given by the formula [formula] Note that dH(z,0)  =  |z|.

In this section, we compute the metric d1 on the disk induced by the uniform algebra H∞1. Consideration of this metric will show that, at least many of the kernels Kα,β are necessary even for interpolation on two points. While we have no need here of what d1 is on the rest of the maximal ideal space of H∞1, which coincides with that of H∞, it is easy to see that the two metrics are equal except when both points lie in the open disk [formula]. Indeed, if x lies in the corona, then replacing f by z2f has no impact on the supremum in the definition of dA(x,y).

First we compute

[formula]

More generally, we can compute d1(z,w) by using Theorem 1.1. We know that there exists f∈H∞1 with f(w) = 0, [formula] and f(z) = λ if and only if

[formula]

Since the diagonal entries are positive, this latter condition holds if and only if the determinant is non-negative; i.e.

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

When w = 0 and z = reiθ, this simplifies to

[formula]

It is clear that the minimum occurs precisely when

[formula]

for any [formula]; and equals r4, in agreement with the earlier calculation.

Note that as z varies over the disk, the pair (α,β) where the minimum is attained, up to multiplication by a complex scalar of modulus one, exhausts all of the kernel functions Kα,β with [formula]. Therefore, even for interpolation of two points, {0,z}, all of the kernels for [formula], or at least a dense subset, are necessary to attain the appropriate value for the minimum as z varies over the disk.

C*-envelopes for Two-point Interpolation

As we have seen in Section [\ref=S:Cenv] and also in the work of [\cite=McP] and [\cite=So], C*e(A / IF) can be quite difficult to understand and be quite a complicated C*-algebra when IF is the ideal of functions vanishing at 3 or more points. In contrast, given any uniform algebra A on a compact Hausdorff space X and any two point set F, [formula] or [formula] This fact is referred to in [\cite=McP], but we shall make it a bit more explicit here by exhibiting the completely isometric representation of A / IF into [formula]. This will highlight the relationship of this representation with the pseudo-hyperbolic metric introduced in the previous section.

Let us assume that X is a compact, Hausdorff space and A  ⊆  C(X) is a uniform algebra. Fix a two point subset F = {x1,x2} of X, and let IF denote the ideal of functions vanishing on F.

Pick any two functions, f1,f2∈A, such that fi(xj)  =  δi,j. It is easy to see that in the quotient, Ei = fi  +  IF for i = 1,2 satisfy

[formula]

where E = 1 + IF denotes the identity element of the quotient algebra. That is, A / IF is a two-idempotent operator algebra in the sense of [\cite=Pa]. Moreover, as is discussed in [\cite=Pa], given [formula]

[formula]

More generally, given [formula] we have that

[formula]

In particular, we have that

[formula]

By a similar argument, [formula].

Let π:A / IF  →  B(H) be a completely isometric representation of A / IF as operators on some Hilbert space. Then π(E1) and π(E2) will be idempotent operators which sum to the identity. Hence we may decompose [formula], where H1 is the range of operator π(E1). Writing π(E1) and π(E2) as operator matrices with respect to this decomposition, we see that there exists a bounded operator B:H2  →  H1 such that

[formula]

Since [formula] we see that the norm of B is determined by the pseudo-hyperbolic metric.

As π is completely isometric representation, we have that

[formula]

The last equality follows by computing the norm of the middle term.

The above observations lead readily to the following.

Let X be a compact, Hausdorff space; and let A  ⊆  C(X) be a uniform algebra. Let F = {x1,x2} be a two element subset of X; and set [formula]. Then the representation [formula] defined by

[formula]

is completely isometric. Consequently,

[formula]

In the case that A = H∞1 and [formula], it is readily seen that [formula]. Therefore [formula]

Concluding Remarks and Open Problems

We have seen that for some sets of points, the matrix-valued version of the interpolation result (Theorem [\ref=thm1]) fails, in particular, if one of the points is sufficiently close to 0.

Given a finite subset [formula] of [formula] with [formula], is the homomorphism [formula] ever completely isometric? Is it, in fact, ever 2-isometeric?

For three distinct points of the form {0,z2,z3}, find three explicit matrices for which interpolation fails? Does the homomorphism F fail to be even two isometric?

Disprove for [formula] the distance formula

[formula]

by exhibiting a concrete function.

Although we know what the C*-envelope of the quotient algebra is in the case where one of the points is 0, we have not been able to determine the C*-envelope in any other cases. The natural follow-up to Problem [\ref=P1] is:

For n  ≥  3 distinct non-zero points in [formula] find the C*-envelope, C*e(H∞1  /  IF). Are its irreducible representations all of dimension n + 1?

In the discussion of the hyperbolic metric, we showed that a large set of kernels are necessary to determine interpolation. But we were not able to show that all are required.

Is a dense set of kernels, Kα,β, (up to multiplication by a complex number of modulus one), necessary to attain the metric d1? If not, is a dense set necessary for the general interpolation problem?

A famous result for the annulus due to Federov-Vinnikov [\cite=FV] says that once one fixes the points [formula], then to determine interpolation, one does not need to consider the whole family of kernel functions parameterized by the circle, but in fact, for scalar interpolation, there are two points on the circle such that just these two kernel functions will give necessary and sufficient conditions for interpolation. See [\cite=Mc] for another proof of this fact. Thus, although as the points vary over the annulus all kernels are needed, once the points are specified only two kernels are needed for scalar-valued interpolation. Later, McCullough[\cite=Mc] proved that even when the points are specified, to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for matrix-valued interpolation all kernel functions (that is a dense subset) are needed. McCullough's result was refined somewhat by McCullough and the second author in [\cite=McP], where it was shown that for any finite set of three or more points [formula] in the annulus the C*-envelope of the quotient algebra was isomorphic to [formula]; and that the irreducible representations of this algebra were parameterized by the kernel functions. McCullough's result then followed from this computation of the C*-envelope.

These considerations motivate the following problem.

Given [formula] distinct points in [formula], does there exist a finite subset F of the complex unit two-sphere such that, given any complex numbers, [formula], there exists f∈H∞1 with [formula] and f(zi) = wi for [formula] if and only if

[formula]

is positive semidefinite for all (α,β)∈F?
