On fixed point sets of distinguished collections for groups of parabolic characteristic

Introduction

The subgroup complexes associated to suitably chosen collections of p-subgroups are relevant to the understanding of the p-local structure of the underlying group G, and also provide valuable tools for investigating the modular representation theory and the mod-p cohomology of the group G.

This paper continues the systematic study, started in [\cite=mgo3], of certain collections of p-subgroups, which we call distinguished. These are subcollections of the standard collections of p-subgroups and which consist of those p-subgroups which contain p-central elements in their centers.

A group G has parabolic characteristic p if all the p-local subgroups which contain a Sylow p-subgroup of G have characteristic p. We study the homotopy type of the fixed point sets of subgroups of order p acting on the complex Δ of distinguished p-radical subgroups of G, for groups of parabolic characteristic p. Let P = 〈x〉 be such a p-subgroup. If x is p-central then the fixed point set is contractible. If x is not of central type, then the homotopy type of the corresponding fixed point set is determined by the group structure of CG(x). If CG(x) has characteristic p, then ΔP is again contractible. If we assume that CG(x) does not have characteristic p, and that [formula] has parabolic characteristic p, then the fixed point set ΔP is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the complex of distinguished p-radical subgroups of [formula].

In Section 2, notation is introduced and a few basic results are reviewed. In Section 3, two varieties of collections of p-subgroups are defined and various homotopy properties are described; the fixed point sets of p-central elements acting on the corresponding complexes are shown to be contractible. In Section 4, under certain hypotheses, the fixed point sets of subgroups of order p of noncentral type are shown to be equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the complex for a quotient of the centralizer. In Section 5 we consider a few examples where G is a sporadic finite simple group, applications to modular representation theory are also given.

Notation, terminology and standard results

Throughout this paper G is a finite group and p a prime dividing its order.

A p-subgroup R of G is called p-radical if R  =  Op(NG(R)), where Op(H) is the largest normal p-subgroup of H. Every p-subgroup Q of G is contained in a p-radical subgroup of G uniquely determined by Q and G. This is called the radical closure of Q in G and it is the last term RQ of the chain Pi + 1  =  Op(NG(Pi)) starting with Q  =  P0. It is easy to see that NG(Q)  ≤  NG(RQ). A p-subgroup R is called p-centric if Z(R) is a Sylow p-subgroup of CG(R), in which case CG(R)  =  Z(R)  ×  H, with H a subgroup of order relatively prime to p.

A collection C of p-subgroups of G is a set of p-subgroups which is closed under conjugation; a collection is a G-poset under the inclusion relation with G acting by conjugation. The nerve |C| is the simplicial complex which has as simplices proper inclusion chains in C; the correspondence C  →  |C| allows assignment of topological concepts to posets [\cite=qu78]. A collection C is contractible if |C| is contractible. A poset map is a G-homotopy equivalence if and only if the induced map on H-fixed points is a homotopy equivalence for all H  ≤  G; see [\cite=tw91].

Let G be a finite group and C  ⊆  D two collections of subgroups.

[\cite=tw91] Assume that D> P is NG(P)-contractible for all [formula]. Then the inclusion [formula] is a G-homotopy equivalence.

[\cite=tw91] Assume either that C≥  P is NG(P)-contractible for all P∈D, or that C≤  P is NG(P)-contractible for all P∈D. Then the inclusion [formula] is a G-homotopy equivalence.

[\cite=gs] Suppose that F is a G-equivariant poset endomorphism of C satisfying either F  ≥  IdC or F  ≤  IdC. Then, for any collection C' containing the image of F, the inclusions F(C)  ⊆  C'  ⊆  C are G-homotopy equivalences.

[\cite=gs] Let C be a collection of p-subgroups that is closed under passage to p-overgroups. Let H be an arbitrary p-subgroup in G. Then the inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence.

In what follows Ap(G) will denote the Quillen collection of nontrivial elementary abelian p-subgroups, Sp(G) the Brown collection of nontrivial p-subgroups and Bp(G) the Bouc collection of nontrivial p-radical subgroups. The inclusions Ap(G)  ⊆  Sp(G) and Bp(G)  ⊆  Sp(G) are G-homotopy equivalences [\cite=tw91].

Let Cep(G) denote the subcollection of Sp(G) consisting of nontrivial p-centric subgroups and let [formula] be the collection of nontrivial p-radical and p-centric subgroups. These two collections are not in general homotopy equivalent with Sp(G); however the inclusion map [formula] is a G-homotopy equivalence; see [\cite=gs].

Assume G has characteristic p. Then the following hold:

[\cite=gls2b] G has local characteristic p.

[\cite=sol74] If P is a p-subgroup of G and H a subgroup of G with PCG(P)  ≤  H  ≤  NG(P), then H has characteristic p.

Let G be a finite group.

Let P  ≤  G be a p-subgroup. Then CG(P) has characteristic p if and only if NG(P) has characteristic p.

[\cite=sol74] Let Q be a p-subgroup of a finite group G, with CG(Q) of characteristic p. Let P be a p-subgroup of G containing Q. Then CG(P) has characteristic p.

Examples of groups of local characteristic p are the groups of Lie type defined over fields of characteristic p, some of the sporadic groups (such as M22,M24,Co2 for p = 2, M11, McL for p = 3, McL, Ly for p = 5), and any groups with self-centralizing Sylow p-subgroup of order p, such as Alt(p).

Any group of local characteristic p has parabolic characteristic p. Some examples of sporadic groups of parabolic characteristic p are: M12,J2,Co1 for p = 2, M12,J3,Co1 for p = 3, J2,Co1,Co2 for p = 5.

Distinguished collections of p-subgroups

An element x of order p in G is p-central if x is in the center of a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Let Γp(G) denote the family of p-central elements of G. For a p-subgroup P of G define:

[formula]

Further, for Cp(G) a collection of p-subgroups of G denote:

[formula]

the collection of subgroups in Cp(G) which contain p-central elements in their centers. We call p(G) the distinguished Cp(G) collection. We shall refer to the subgroups in p(G) as distinguished subgroups. Also, denote

[formula]

the collection of subgroups in Cp(G) which contain a p-central element. Obviously [formula].

All p-centric subgroups of G are distinguished, that is Cep(G)  ⊆  p(G). Consequently the collection of distinguished p-radical subgroups contains the collection of p-centric and p-radical subgroups: [formula].

Let P be a centric p-subgroup of G and let S be any Sylow p-subgroup of G which contains P. Then Z(S)  ≤  CG(P) and Z(S)  ≤  Z(P).

If R is a p-subgroup of G and if NG(R) contains a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then R is distinguished. This is easy to see since in this case [formula]. Thus [formula].

Let P∈Sp(G) and assume that NG(P) has characteristic p. Then CG(Op(NG(P))) = Z(Op(NG(P))), and thus Op(NG(P)) is p-centric and distinguished.

Since P  ≤  Op(NG(P)), we have CG(Op(NG(P)))  ≤  CG(P)  ≤  NG(P). Thus CG(Op(NG(P))) = CNG(P)(Op(NG(P)))  ≤  Op(NG(P)), and so CG(Op(NG(P))) = Z(Op(NG(P))). Clearly Op(NG(P)) is p-centric, and Proposition 3.1 implies this group is distinguished.

Let G have local characteristic p. Then [formula].

Let R∈Bp(G), so that R = Op(NG(R)). Since NG(R) has characteristic p, CG(R) = Z(R) and [formula].

Let G have parabolic characteristic p. Then:

If [formula] then NG(P) has characteristic p.

[formula].

(a) Let z∈P be a p-central element, so that NG(〈z〉) contains a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Thus NG(〈z〉) has characteristic p. By Proposition 2.5(1), CG(z) has characteristic p. By Proposition 2.5(2), CG(P) has characteristic p, and another application of Proposition 2.5(1) shows NG(P) has characteristic p.

(b) Note that [formula]. Let [formula]. Then NG(R) has characteristic p, which implies that CG(R)  =  Z(R). Thus [formula].

It follows from the above Proposition that if G has parabolic characteristic p and [formula], then V does not contain any p-central elements.

If G has parabolic characteristic p, then the collections p(G),p(G) and p(G) are G-homotopy equivalent.

We first show that the inclusion map [formula] is a G-homotopy equivalence. We attain this result by showing that p(G)≤  P is NG(P)-contractible for any P∈p(G) and then applying Theorem 2.2(2). If Q∈p(G)≤  P then QP̂∈p(G)≤  P. We obtain the following contracting homotopy: Q  ≤  QP̂  ≥  P̂. The NG(P)-contractibility follows from the fact that the two inequalities correspond to poset maps which are NG(P)-equivariant.

To show that B̂p(G) is G-homotopy equivalent to Ŝp(G), we will use Theorem 2.2(1). Thus we have to prove that for each [formula], the subcollection p(G)> P is NG(P)-contractible.

Let Q∈p(G)> P, so P < NQ(P)  ≤  NG(P). The subgroup NQ(P) is distinguished since it contains Z(Q). As P is a distinguished p-subgroup, NG(P) has characteristic p. Denote ONP  =  Op(NG(P)) and observe that P  <  ONP. By Lemma 3.3, ONP is p-centric and distinguished. Since the collection of p-centric subgroups is closed under passage to p-overgroups, NQ(P)ONP is also p-centric and thus it is distinguished. Now consider the string of poset maps p(G)> P  →  p(G)> P given by:

[formula]

which proves the NG(P)-contractibility of p(G)> P.

Assume that G has parabolic characteristic p; then the inclusion [formula] is a G-homotopy equivalence.

We will show that the subcollection p(G)≥  P is NG(P)-contractible for every [formula] and then apply Theorem 2.2(2). Let Q∈p(G)≥  P so P  ≤  NQ(P)  ≤  Q and NQ(P) is a distinguished p-subgroup with Z(Q)  ≤  Z(NQ(P)). Next consider RP, the radical closure of P defined in Section 2. Note that NQ(P)RP is a subgroup in NG(RP) since NQ(P)  ≤  NG(P)  ≤  NG(RP). By Proposition 3.5, NG(RP) has characteristic p and RP is p-centric. Thus NQ(P)RP is also p-centric, and both RP and NQ(P)RP are distinguished. Now consider the string of NG(P)-equivariant poset maps p(G)≥  P  →  p(G)≥  P given by:

[formula]

which proves the contractibility of the subcollection p(G)≥  P.

The fixed point set [formula] is NG(Z)-contractible whenever Z = 〈z〉 with z a p-central element in G.

First note that [formula]. If [formula] then [formula] since Z normalizes PZ. There is a contracting homotopy P  ≤  PZ  ≥  Z via NG(Z)-equivariant maps.

Since p(G),p(G),p(G) and [formula] are G-homotopy equivalent, for G of parabolic characteristic p, Zp(G), Zp(G) and Zp(G) are NG(Z)-contractible as well.

Fixed point sets for noncentral elements

We shall investigate the fixed point set of an element of order p of noncentral type; these are elements of order p in G which are not conjugate to any element in the center of a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Under certain hypotheses, we will prove that the fixed point set is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the complex for a quotient of the centralizer. This will require a combination of nine homotopy equivalences.

The proof of our main result (Theorem 4.12) will require the following hypotheses:

G is a finite group of parabolic characteristic p;

C  =  CG(T) does not have characteristic p;

The quotient group [formula] has parabolic characteristic p.

We first recall a result which is due to Grodal [\cite=gr02], see also Sawabe [\cite=sa06]. For completeness we provide a proof.

(in the proof of [\cite=gr02]) Let C be a collection of nontrivial p-subgroups of G, which is closed under passage to p-overgroups. Let Q∈Sp(G). If C' is a collection satisfying: [formula] then C> Q is NG(Q)-homotopy equivalent to C'> Q.

To simplify the notation, we shall denote by X  =  C> Q and by Y  =  C'> Q. We will prove that X> P is NG(P)-contractible for all [formula]. Then, an application of Theorem 2.2(1) will give the result. Note that X> P  =  {R∈C  |  P < R}. Denote ONP = Op(NG(P)); since P is not p-radical, P  <  ONP. By elementary group theory, for P < R, we have P  <  NR(P)  ≤  R. Since C is closed under passage to p-overgroups, the subgroups NR(P),NR(P)ONP and ONP are also in X> P. Thus we obtain a contracting homotopy given by the string of NG(P)-equivariant poset maps X> P  →  X> P :

[formula]

Hence X> P is NG(P)-contractible.

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p. The inclusion [formula] is a NG(T)-homotopy equivalence.

We verify the following chain of NG(T)-homotopy equivalences:

[formula]

The subcollections Tp(G) and [formula] are NG(T)-homotopy equivalent because [formula] and p(G) are G-homotopy equivalent. The next step follows by an application of Theorem 2.2(4). The collection [formula] is closed under passage to p-overgroups; thus the inclusion [formula] is a homotopy equivalence. Next, since [formula] it follows that [formula]. The homotopy equivalence between [formula] and p(G)> T follows from an application of Proposition 4.3 with [formula] and C' = p(G). Note that Proposition 3.5(b) provides the necessary hypothesis [formula]. To see that [formula] is a homotopy equivalence, consider the poset map p(G)> T  →  p(G)> T given by Q  ↦  NQ(T) whose image lies in p(G)≤  NG(T)> T, and apply Theorem 2.2(3). The final equality follows from T  ≤  P  ≤  NG(T) if and only if T  ≤  P  ≤  C, since [formula] implies that T  ≤  Z(P).

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p. Then [formula] if and only if C has characteristic p.

If [formula] then NG(OC) has characteristic p, by Proposition 3.5(a). As [formula], it follows that CNG(OC)(T) = CG(T) = C and so C = T  ·  CNG(OC)(T). Thus C has characteristic p, by Proposition 2.4(2). Conversely, assume that C has characteristic p. Note T  ≤  OC, so CG(OC)  ≤  C. Thus CG(OC)  =  CC(OC)  ≤  OC, and so OC is p-centric. Thus [formula].

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p, and assume that [formula]. Then the fixed point set p(G)T is contractible.

Consider the poset map [formula] given by φ(P) = P  ·  OC. If OC contains p-central elements, the poset map φ will have image equal to [formula]; this is contractible, a cone on OC. Apply Theorem 2.2(3); combining this with Proposition 4.4 proves the result.

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p, and assume that C does not have characteristic p. The inclusion [formula] is a NG(T)-homotopy equivalence.

The poset map [formula] given by φ(P) = P  ·  OC now has image in [formula] since OC is purely noncentral, containing no p-central elements of G. The result follows by an application of Theorem 2.2(3).

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p. The inclusion [formula] is a NG(T)-homotopy equivalence, where H satisfies T  ≤  H  ≤  C and NG(T)  ≤  NG(H).

Let P∈Y; we will show that X≥  P is equivariantly contractible and apply Theorem 2.2(2). Let RP be the radical closure of P; note that T  <  P  ≤  RP, so that Z(RP)  ≤  C. By Proposition 3.5(b), RP is p-centric and distinguished. This implies that Z(RP) is distinguished, and also P  ·  Z(RP) is distinguished, since Z(RP)  ≤  Z(P  ·  Z(RP)). Let Q∈X≥  P. P  ≤  Q implies Z(Q)  ≤  Z(NQ(P)), so that NQ(P) is distinguished. Observe that NQ(P)  ≤  NG(P)  ≤  NG(RP), implying NQ(P)Z(RP) is a group. Choose SR∈Sylp(NG(RP)) satisfying NQ(P)  ≤  SR, and extend to S∈Sylp(G). Note RP  ≤  SR  ≤  S. Then Z(S)  ≤  CG(NQ(P)) and Z(S)  ≤  CG(RP), so that Z(S)  ≤  Z(RP). This implies that Z(S)  ≤  Z(NQ(P)Z(RP)), so that NQ(P)Z(RP) is distinguished. Now consider the string of equivariant poset maps X≥  P  →  X≥  P given by:

[formula]

which proves the equivariant contractibility of the subcollection X≥  P.

There is no obvious relationship among those elements which are p-central in G, or in C, or in [formula]. In order to overcome this difficulty, we define a subcollection [formula] of p(G)≤  C> OC as follows:

This subcollection is also contained in p(C), and it contains all p-centric subgroups P in C which properly contain OC, since if P  ≤  ST  ≤  S, then Z(S)  ≤  CG(P), implying Z(S)  ≤  Z(P).

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p. The inclusion [formula] is an NG(T)-homotopy equivalence.

We will apply Theorem 2.2(2) once again. We need to show that [formula] is equivariantly contractible whenever Q∈p(G)≤  C> OC. Since Q is a distinguished p-subgroup of G, NG(Q) has characteristic p, by Proposition 3.5(a). Also QCG(Q)  ≤  NC(Q)  ≤  NG(Q) since T  <  Q  ≤  C; by Proposition 2.4(2), it follows that NC(Q) has characteristic p. Set OQ  =  Op(NC(Q)) and observe that, according to Lemma 3.3, OQ is p-centric. For P  ≤  C, NP(Q)OQ is a group which is also p-centric. Thus OQ and NP(Q)OQ lie in [formula]. Assume now that [formula] and consider the contracting homotopy given by the following string of equivariant poset maps:

[formula]

This concludes the proof of the Proposition.

Let G be a finite group of parabolic characteristic p, and assume that C does not have characteristic p. Also assume that [formula] has parabolic characteristic p. Then the map [formula] induced by the quotient map [formula] is a homotopy equivalence.

To see that [formula], let [formula]. Recall that Z(S)  ≤  Z(ST) and [formula]. Thus [formula]. Since OC is purely noncentral (Lemma 4.5), the map [formula] is injective on the p-central elements of Z(S). Therefore [formula] implies [formula], and we have [formula].

According to a result of Thévenaz and Webb [\cite=tw91], the poset map [formula] is an equivariant homotopy equivalence if [formula] is equivariantly contractible for any [formula]. Define [formula]. Then [formula], since OC  ≤  P. This latter set is just [formula]. Given [formula], consider the string of equivariant poset maps [formula] given by:

[formula]

We need to show that all of these terms lie in [formula]. Note that NP(Q)  ≤  P  ≤  ST  ≤  S, and Q  ≤  P implies that Z(P)  ≤  Z(NP(Q)). Thus [formula]. Next, we have [formula], using OC  ≤  Q. Thus OQ: = Op(NC(Q)) is equal to [formula] by the correspondence theorem for normal subgroups applied to [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] has characteristic p, by Proposition 3.5(a). Then [formula]. Since T  ≤  Q  ≤  OQ, CG(OQ)  ≤  CG(T) = C and so CG(OQ) = CC(OQ). Therefore [formula]. The group OQ is p-centric in G. But [formula] contains all subgroups of C, properly containing OC, which are p-centric in G. The p-overgroup NP(Q)OQ is also p-centric and lies in [formula].

We can now state the main result of this section.

Maintain the notation in 4.1 and the hypotheses in Remark 4.2. There is an NG(T)-equivariant homotopy equivalence [formula].

We have the chain of NG(T)-homotopy equivalences:

[formula]

The first step is Proposition 4.4; then apply Proposition 4.8 with H  =  T. Next, use Proposition 4.7, and then Proposition 4.8 again with H = OC. Finally, a combination of Propositions 4.10 and 4.11 completes the proof of the theorem.

Examples and Lefschetz modules

We will discuss three examples, and give an application to modular representation theory. Recall that if a group G acts on a simplicial complex Δ, we can construct the virtual Lefschetz module by taking the alternating sum of the vector spaces (over a field of characteristic p) spanned by the chains. To obtain the reduced Lefschetz module, subtract the trivial one dimensional representation. Information about fixed point sets leads to details about the vertices of irreducible summands of this module.

The Fischer group Fi22 and p = 2 We begin with the sporadic simple Fischer group Fi22, which has parabolic characteristic 2 and has three conjugacy classes of involutions, denoted 2A,2B and 2C in the Atlas [\cite=atlas]. The class 2B is 2-central. Their centralizers are CFi22(2A) = 2.U6(2),  CFi22(2B) = (2  ×  21 + 8+:U4(2)):2 and CFi22(2C) = 25 + 8:(S3  ×  32:4).

We consider the simplicial complex Δ whose vertex stabilizers are the four 2-local subgroups of Fi22.

[formula]

The flag stabilizers are listed below.

[formula]

The subgroup complex Δ is also known as the "standard" 2-local geometry for Fi22. The geometry Δ is G-homotopy equivalent to Bcen2(Fi22), and since Fi22 has parabolic characteristic 2, this is equal to the distinguished collection 2(Fi22); for details we refer the reader to Benson and Smith [\cite=bs04].

We shall use the notation from the Modular Atlas homepage [\cite=moc], where φi denotes an irreducible module of Fi22 and PFi22(φi) is its corresponding projective cover.

Let Δ be the standard 2-local geometry for the Fischer group Fi22.

The reduced Lefschetz module is

[formula]

The fixed point sets Δ2B and Δ2C are contractible.

The fixed point set Δ2A is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the building for the Lie group U6(2).

There is precisely one nonprojective summand of the reduced Lefschetz module, it has vertex 〈2A〉 and lies in a block with the same group as defect group.

(a) The first two terms of the reduced Lefschetz module, the projective covers of φ12 and φ13, lie in the principal block. Also φ15 is projective and lies in block 2, with defect zero. Next, φ16 is not projective, and lies in block 3 with defect one. This formula will be shown to be valid at the level of the Green ring of virtual modules, and not just the Grothendieck ring of characters.

The alternating sum of the induced characters was computed using GAP[\cite=gap], and the character corresponding to the formula for [formula] given above was obtained. The eight terms lying in H3  =  26:Sp6(2) can be combined to yield the character of the inflation of the Steinberg module for the symplectic group.

(b) Proposition 3.9 (also see Remark 3.10) tells us that the fixed point set Δ2B is contractible. The contractibility of Δ2B implies that ΔQ is mod 2 acyclic for any 2-group Q containing an involution of type 2B (by Smith theory), and thus the reduced Lefschetz module [formula]. A theorem due to Burry and Carlson [\cite=bc82] and to Puig (unpublished) was applied by Robinson [\cite=rob88] to Lefschetz modules to obtain the following result; also see [\cite=sa06]. The number of indecomposable summands of [formula] with vertex Q is equal to the number of indecomposable summands of [formula] with the same vertex Q. The proof of this result uses the Green correspondence, and the relationship to the Brauer correspondence permits a conclusion regarding the blocks in which the summands lie. This implies that the vertices of the indecomposable summands of [formula] do not contain any 2-central involutions.

Proposition 4.6 applies to the element 2C since OC  =  O2(CFi22(2C)) contains 2-central elements. The elementary abelian 25  ≤  25 + 8 is of the type 25  =  2A6B15C10; there is a purely 2-central 24  ≤  25. Note that Δ2C being contractible implies that no vertex of a summand of [formula] contains an involution of type 2C.

(c) Theorem 4.12 applies to the fixed point set Δ2A, since the quotient group of the centralizer CFi22(2A) / O2(CFi22(2A)) = U6(2) is a Lie group. Therefore Δ2A is homotopy equivalent to the building for U6(2). The reduced Lefschetz module associated to this action on the building is the irreducible Steinberg module. The vertex under the action of 2.U6(2) is 〈2A〉. Thus there exists one indecomposable summand of the Lefschetz module with vertex 2  =  〈2A〉, lying in a block with the same group as defect group (block 3 with defect one). Note that since this block has cyclic defect group of order two, there is only one nonprojective indecomposable module lying in this block, namely the irreducible module φ16. Also note that since Δ2A is homotopy equivalent to a building, ΔQ will be contractible for any 2-group Q of order at least four which contains an involution of type 2A. This implies that such a group Q cannot be a vertex of a summand of [formula].

It follows from the previous steps that there is precisely one nonprojective summand of the reduced Lefschetz module; it has vertex 〈2A〉 and it lies in a block with the same group as defect group. The remaining summands are projective and are determined by their characters, and so the formula for [formula] is valid at the level of the Green ring of virtual modules, and not just the Grothendieck ring of characters.

The Conway group Co3 and p = 3 The group Co3 has parabolic characteristic 3, and it has three conjugacy classes of elements of order three, denoted 3A, 3B and 3C, with the 3-central elements being those of type 3A. The normalizers are NCo3(〈3A〉) = 31 + 4+:4S6, NCo3(〈3B〉) = 35(2  ×  S5) and NCo3(〈3C〉) = S3  ×  L2(8):3. Note that L2(8):3  =  Ree(3)  =    2G2(3) is a Chevalley group having local characteristic 3.

Let Δ be the subgroup complex associated to the distinguished 3-radical collection 3(Co3).

The fixed point sets Δ3A and Δ3B are contractible, and Δ3C is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the building for 2G2(3).

The reduced Lefschetz module [formula] has precisely one nonprojective irreducible summand, which has vertex 〈3C〉 and lies in a block with the same group as defect group.

Proposition 3.9 (and Remark 3.10) implies that the fixed point set Δ3A of the 3-central element is contractible. Proposition 4.6 implies that Δ3B is contractible since OC = O3(CCo3(3B)) = 35 = 3A55B66 contains 3-central elements. The reduced Lefschetz module [formula] has no summands with a vertex containing either an element of type 3A or an element of type 3B, by a similar argument to the one in part (b) of the previous proposition.

Theorem 4.12 applies to Δ3C. The reduced Lefschetz module for the 2G2(3) building is the irreducible Steinberg module, and under the action of NCo3(〈3C〉), the vertex is 〈3C〉. Also, since Δ3C is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to a building, ΔQ will be contractible for any 3-group Q of order at least nine which contains an element of type 3C. This implies that such a group Q cannot be a vertex of a summand of [formula]. The aforementioned Burry-Carlson theorem in Robinson's formulation implies now the result of part (b).

The Harada-Norton group HN and p = 5 The group HN has parabolic characteristic 5 and has five conjugacy classes of elements of order 5, denoted 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D and 5E; see [\cite=atlas]. The elements of type 5B are 5-central. An element of type 5D is the square of an element of type 5C, so they generate a group of order 5 denoted 5CD. The centralizers are CHN(5A) = 5  ×  U3(5), CHN(5B) = 51 + 4.21 + 4.5, CHN(5CD) = 53.SL2(5) and CHN(5E) = 5  ×  51 + 2:22.

Let Δ be the subgroup complex associated to the distinguished 5-radical collection 5(HN).

The fixed point sets Δ5B, Δ5CD and Δ5E are contractible, and Δ5A is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the building for U3(5).

The reduced Lefschetz module [formula] has precisely one nonprojective summand, which has vertex 〈5A〉 and lies in a block with the same group as defect group.

Proposition 3.9 (and Remark 3.10) applies to the 5-central elements of type 5B, so that the fixed point set Δ5B is contractible. The two groups 53  =  B6(CD)25 and 5  ×  51 + 2 contain 5-central elements (note that Z(51 + 2) = 〈5B〉), thus according to Proposition 4.6 the fixed point sets Δ5CD and Δ5E are both contractible. Thus the reduced Lefschetz module [formula] has no summands with a vertex containing elements of type 5B, 5C, 5D or 5E.

Theorem 4.12 applies to the elements of type 5A, so that Δ5A is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the building for U3(5). The reduced Lefschetz module for this building is the irreducible Steinberg module, and under the action of NHN(〈5A〉), the vertex is 〈5A〉. Thus [formula] has one summand with vertex 〈5A〉 lying in a block with the same group as defect group. Since Δ5A is homotopy equivalent to a building, ΔQ will be contractible for any 5-group Q of order at least 25 which contains an element of type 5A. This implies that such a group Q cannot be a vertex of a summand of [formula].
