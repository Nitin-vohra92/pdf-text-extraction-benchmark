Evanescent character of the repulsive thermal Casimir force

Over the last decade there was a growing interest to the Casimir force [\cite=Cas48] that was measured in a series of recent experiments [\cite=Exper]. Particularly the thermal part of the force was a subject of active and often controversial discussion (see [\cite=Mil04] for a review). Here we are concentrated on the thermal force, which does not include the zero point fluctuations. The repulsion discussed in this paper has the meaning of a negative thermal correction to the force at zero temperature, but the total force is always attractive [\cite=DLP]. At large distances, a  ≫   (kB = 1), the thermal force is given by the Lifshitz limit [\cite=Lif55] [\cite=DLP] [\cite=LP8old]

[formula]

where a is the distance between parallel plates and T is the temperature of the system. This formula was derived for two dielectric plates with the static dielectric constants ε1 and ε2. The force between two ideal metals can be found from Eq. ([\ref=Lif_lim]) as the limit ε1,2  →    ∞   that gives FLif = Tζ(3) / 8πa3. This equation became one of the points of controversy [\cite=Bos00] [\cite=Therm] because direct calculation of the thermal force between ideal metals [\cite=Meh67] gave the result, which is two times larger. This contradiction found its resolution [\cite=Hoy03] [\cite=Sve05]. At large distances only low frequency electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations contribute to the force. In this limit s-polarized EM field degenerates to pure magnetic one, which penetrates freely via a nonmagnetic metal [\cite=Sve05]. On the contrary, p-polarized field is pure electric and reflected by the metal. For the ideal metal both polarizations are reflected and the force will be 2 times larger. In this sense the ideal metal is rather the limit case of a superconductor than of a normal metal [\cite=Ant06].

The difference between ideal and real metals manifests itself also at small distances, a  ≪  . The force between ideal metals is attractive and small [\cite=Meh67]. On the contrary, the force between real metals is relatively large and repulsive [\cite=Bos00]. This difference did not found yet a clear physical explanation.

In this paper it is demonstrated that at distances [formula] the evanescent contribution of s-polarization to the thermal Casimir force dominates for two metals or in the case of a metal and a high-permittivity dielectric. For both material configurations the force is repulsive but in the latter case it is free of controversies accompanying interaction of metals. For ideal metals the evanescent contribution vanishes but propagating one is naturally small.

Due to technical convenience in most cases the force is calculated using the Lifshitz formula [\cite=Lif55] written via imaginary frequencies [\cite=DLP] [\cite=LP8old]. However, in this form a significant physical information is lost. Originally this formula was presented in the real frequency domain [\cite=LP8old] where the force is naturally composed of two contributions of the fluctuating fields: propagating waves (PW) and evanescent waves (EW). It is well known from optics that each component can be manipulated independently. In the case of the Casimir force the PW and EW components respond differently on the change of the material or variation of the distance. Understanding of this behavior is crucial for tailoring the force.

Recently Intravaia and Lamrecht [\cite=Int05] demonstrated that at zero temperature, T = 0, propagating modes give an attractive contribution to the force between metals while evanescent modes are responsible for the repulsion. For p-polarization both contributions are large but cancel each other in substantial degree so that the resulting force is attractive and small. One might hope to shift the balance to the repulsion using nanostructured materials [\cite=Int05]. It is not clear for the moment how realistic is this suggestion but in this paper it is shown that the repulsion can dominate at least for the thermal part of the force.

The thermal force also revealed interesting cancelations between EW and PW contributions. At large distances significant cancelations are realized for dielectrics [\cite=Ant06] and metals [\cite=Sve06]. The cancelation is reduced in the non-equilibrium situation when the temperatures of the bodies are different [\cite=Ant06]. It has to be stressed that in the situation out of equilibrium the real frequency representation is the only one possible due to absence of analyticity [\cite=Ant06].

If the wave vector in the vacuum gap is [formula] with [formula] and [formula], then in the real frequency domain the thermal force is [\cite=LP8old] [\cite=Ant06] F = FPW + FEW, where Here Rμ = rμ1rμ2, where rμm (m = 1,2) is the Fresnel reflection coefficient for body 1 or 2 and transverse electric (μ = s) or magnetic (μ = p) polarization. The integration variable y is expressed via the physical values as y = 2ak0 for PW and y = 2a|k0| for EW. The distance dependence is included in the characteristic frequency ωc = c / 2a. In terms of ω and y the reflection coefficients are

[formula]

where [formula] and εm  =  εm(ω) is the dielectric function of the body m.

Consider first the case of two similar metals, which can be described by the Drude dielectric function ε(ω) = 1 - ω2p  /  ω(ω + iωτ), where ωp and ωτ are the plasma and relaxation frequencies, respectively. For the qualitative analysis it will be assumed that ωp  →    ∞  , ωτ  →  0 (but both finite). Actual values of the parameters will be taken into account in numerical calculations.

At large distances, [formula] (thermal wavelength), PW contribution can be found [\cite=Ant06] using first the multiple-reflection expansion [formula] to avoid poles and after that one can safely put R = 1 for both polarizations. The result will be

[formula]

where we separated two equal contributions from s- and p-polarizations. Of course, this result coincides with the force between ideal metals and one could expect that the EW contribution must be zero. But this is not true.

For s-polarized EW the reflection coefficient is

[formula]

If we neglect y in Eq. ([\ref=rs_metal]) in comparison with ωp  /  ωc, then rs will be real and the EW contribution will vanish. Nonzero result for FsEW originates from very low frequencies

[formula]

At these frequencies one can expand eω / T - 1  ≈  ω / T in Eq. ([\ref=FEW]). The resulting integral does not depend on the frequency scale. It means that even arbitrarily small ωτ plays role keeping EW contribution finite [\cite=Sve06]:

[formula]

As the result the PW and EW contributions precisely cancel each other for s-polarization as it happens for dielectrics. It must be so because a nonmagnetic metal is transparent for s-polarization in the low frequency limit as was explained above.

For p-polarization very low frequencies ([\ref=imp_freq]) are not important because rp has significant imaginary part up to ω  ~  ωτ. The reflection coefficient is not scale invariant and the result of integration in Eq. ([\ref=FEW]) will depend on ωτ. It is straightforward to show that FpEW  ~  ωτ for ωτ  ≪  T or FpEW  ~  ω1 / 2τ in the opposite limit. In our qualitative approximation we have to take FpEW = 0. Therefore, for p-polarization there is no cancelation between PW and EW contributions and we recover the result ([\ref=Lif_lim]).

It is interesting to see how the result will change at smaller distances. If the distance is small in comparison with the thermal wavelength but large in comparison with the penetration depth, c / ωp  ≪  a  ≪  λT, then the EW contribution will not change at all. This is because for s-polarization the low frequencies ([\ref=imp_freq]) still dominate and the conclusion on the behavior of FpEW also remains true. In contrast, the PW contribution changes significantly. At small distances there is no room for standing waves between the plates and the only pressure which is important is the pressure from the back sides of the plates due to the black body radiation:

[formula]

This force is very small and we come to the conclusion that at these distances the dominant component of the total force is s-polarized EW:

[formula]

This force is repulsive and pure evanescent. To the best of our knowledge evanescent character of the thermal force at small distances is stressed here for the first time although one specific example was demonstrated numerically [\cite=Tor04] and rejected as unacceptable.

Of course, Eq. ([\ref=Fm_small]) gives only the leading term and corrections due to finite ωp and ωτ are important for realistic materials but qualitatively the result is not changed. It is demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=fig1], which shows different components of the force in the panel (a) found by numerical integration of Eqs. ([\ref=FPW]), ([\ref=FEW]) at [formula] with the Drude parameters of Au: ωp = 9.0  eV,  ωτ = 0.035  eV. The total force and total contributions from PW and EW are shown in panel (b). All components of the force are normalized to the natural value Tζ(3) / 8πa3. To get the result in respect with the force at T = 0, π24, one has to multiply all the curves to the factor 1.163a / λT.

The repulsive thermal force between metals was discovered by Boström and Sernelius [\cite=Bos00]. This conclusion was disputed [\cite=Gey03] on the basis that the Lifshitz formula could not be applicable to metals and the Fresnel reflection coefficients ([\ref=rsrp]) have to be modified at low frequencies. Interaction between a dielectric and a metal is free of controversies because rs1rs2 is safely going to zero in the low frequency limit even if the metal is ideal. But in this case a weak repulsive force also was demonstrated [\cite=Gey05]. Below it is shown that the repulsion in the system metal-dielectric also originates from the evanescent s-polarized waves. Moreover, for high-permittivity dielectrics the repulsion can be of the same order of magnitude as for metals.

Dielectrics with high permittivity are discussed as the materials for capacitors and resonators [\cite=Tsu06] in GHz region. The dielectric function for some of them shows no absorption up to a few THz. For qualitative analysis it will be assumed that in the range of important frequencies, [formula], the dielectric can be described by a constant high permittivity ε2  ≫  1. Frequency dependent dielectric functions of both metal and dielectric will be used for numerical calculations.

Very low frequencies ([\ref=imp_freq]) do not play significant role in the case of metal and dielectric and for the qualitative analysis we can take the reflection coefficients of the metal as rs1 =  - 1 and rp1 =  + 1. Then the asymptotic behavior of the force at large and small distances can be found analytically.

At large distances the force is not sensitive to the materials at all. This is because grazing waves are important in this limit [\cite=Ant06]. For these waves any material is close to a perfect reflector. For s-polarization Rs  →   + 1 as for two metals and we reproduce the result for that configuration:

[formula]

But in contrast with the metals this result is true at much shorter distances a  ≫  λTε- 1 / 22, where rs2  ≈   - 1 is a good approximation. The total contribution of s-polarization is zero as expected. For p-polarization rp2  ≈  1 at the distance a  ≫  λTε1 / 22 that is much larger than λT. Then

[formula]

The factor - 3 / 4 in FpPW originates from the fact that Rp  →   - 1 in contrast with the case of s-polarization. This is a specific property of the metal-dielectric configuration. For both metal-metal and dielectric-dielectric configurations Rp  →   + 1. The total contribution from p-polarization survives and coincides with the Lifshitz limit ([\ref=Lif_lim]) for ε1  →    ∞   and [formula]. It is interesting to note that the repulsive character of EW is not a universal property as Eq. ([\ref=p_large]) demonstrates.

The small distance limit is realized for s-polarization at a  ≪  λTε- 1 / 22. In this limit it was found

[formula]

Both contributions are repulsive and large in comparison with the black body pressure, but EW contribution dominates at ε2  ≫  1. For p-polarization one can separate the range of very small distances a  ≪  λTε- 3 / 22, but it has no particular interest because at large ε2 it becomes shorter than the penetration depth for the metal, c / ωp. Instead, we present the result in the intermediate range λTε- 3 / 22  ≪  a  ≪  λTε- 1 / 22

[formula]

Comparing EW components in ([\ref=s_small]) and ([\ref=p_small]) in the distance range λTε- 3 / 22  ≪  a  ≪  λTε- 1 / 22 one can see that FpEW  ≪  |FsEW|. We can conclude that at small distances the EW contribution from s-polarized field is the largest in the absolute value and repulsive. When the distance becomes larger |FsEW| increases approaching the limit ([\ref=s_large]). FpEW is also increases but stays much smaller that |FsEW| because the former one reaches the asymptotic value ([\ref=p_large]) only at very large distances a  ≫  λTε1 / 22. When the distance becomes larger than λTε- 1 / 22 the PW component in ([\ref=s_large]) becomes important and FsEW is not dominant any more. It means that the total force has to have a minimum where it is repulsive.

Figure [\ref=fig2] shows the numerical results for different components of the thermal force. The calculations were done for the ideal metal and dielectric with the frequency independent permittivity ε2 = 100 at [formula]. Panel (a) shows behavior at large distances. An important result of the numerical analysis is that the large distance limit is realized at a approximately 100 times larger than λTε- 1 / 22 for s-polarization or λTε1 / 22 for p-polarization. As one can see for p-polarization the PW and EW components did not fully reach the asymptotic values -3/4 and 7/4 even at a = 1000  μm. Nonmonotonic behavior of FpPW also should be mentioned. At smaller distances the absolute values of the PW and EW components are shown in panel (b). Dashed lines represent the asymptotics ([\ref=s_small]) and ([\ref=p_small]).

Figure [\ref=fig3](a) shows the total PW and EW contributions together with the total force. It demonstrates the expected minimum of the total force. Panel (b) shows the total force between SrTiO3 single crystal [\cite=Tsu06] and Au. Frequency dependence of the dielectric functions of both materials was taken into account. The results are presented for three different temperatures. Influence of the temperature is significant because the absorption resonances of SrTiO3 are somewhat below the room temperature. Frequency dependence of ε2 increases both EW components, thus reducing the repulsive force. Of course, with the temperature decrease the minimum becomes deeper and its position is shifted to larger distances.

In conclusion, we analyzed the PW and EW contributions to the thermal Casimir force between two metals and a metal and a high-permittivity dielectric. For both material configurations the repulsive s-polarized EW contribution dominates at [formula]. The thermal repulsion between metals was disputed in the literature but the result of this paper demonstrates that similar effect is realized for uncontroversial case of metal and dielectric.
