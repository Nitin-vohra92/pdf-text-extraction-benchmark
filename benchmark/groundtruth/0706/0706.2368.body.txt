A Note on Carleman's Inequality

Introduction

The well-known Carleman's inequality asserts that for convergent infinite series [formula] with non-negative terms, one has with the constant e best possible.

There is a rich literature on many different proofs of Carleman's inequality as well as its generalizations and extensions. We shall refer the readers to the survey articles [\cite=P&S] and [\cite=D&M] as well as the references therein for an account of Carleman's inequality.

From now on we will assume an  ≥  0 for n  ≥  1 and any infinite sum converges. Our goal in this paper is to study the following weighted Carleman's inequality:

[formula]

where

[formula]

The task here is to determine the best constant C so that inequality [\eqref=1] holds for any non-negative sequence {an}∞n = 1.

One approach to our problem here is to deduce inequality [\eqref=1] via lp operator norm of the corresponding weighted mean matrix. We recall here that a matrix A = (aj,k) is said to be a weighted mean matrix if its entries satisfy:

[formula]

where the notations are as in [\eqref=2]. For p > 1, let lp be the Banach space of all complex sequences [formula] with norm The lp operator norm ||A||p,p of A for A as defined in [\eqref=3] is then defined as the p-th root of the smallest value of the constant U so that the following inequality holds for any [formula]:

[formula]

In an unpublished dissertation [\cite=Car], Cartlidge studied weighted mean matrices as operators on lp and obtained the following result (see also [\cite=B1]).

Let 1 < p <   ∞   be fixed. Let A = (aj,k) be a weighted mean matrix given by [\eqref=3]. If

[formula]

then ||A||p,p  ≤  p / (p - L).

The above theorem implies that one can take U = (p / (p - L))p in inequality [\eqref=4] for any weighted mean matrix A satisfying [\eqref=022]. We note here by a change of variables bk  →  a1 / pk in [\eqref=4] and on letting p  →    +    ∞  , one obtains inequality [\eqref=1] with C = eL as long as [\eqref=022] is satisfied with p replaced by +    ∞   there.

In this note, we will study inequality [\eqref=1] via Carleman's original approach and we shall prove in the next section the following:

Suppose that

[formula]

then inequality [\eqref=1] holds with C = eM.

We point out here that the result of Theorem [\ref=thm1] is better than what one can deduce from Cartlidge's result as discussed above. This can be seen by noting that [\eqref=5] is equivalent to for any integer n  ≥  1. Suppose now [\eqref=022] is satisfied, then the case n = 1 of [\eqref=022] implies L > 0 and it is easy to check that from which we deduce that M  ≤  L.

Bennett [\cite=Be1] conjectured that inequality [\eqref=1] holds for λk = kα for α  >   - 1 with C = 1 / (α + 1). As the cases - 1  <  α  ≤  0 or α  ≥  1 follow directly from Cartlidge's result above (Theorem [\ref=thm02]), the only case left unknown is when 0 < α < 1. As an application of Theorem [\ref=thm1], we shall prove Bennett's conjecture in Section [\ref=sec_3].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

It suffices to establish our assertion with the infinite summation in [\eqref=1] replaced by any finite summation, say from 1 to N  ≥  1 here. We now follow Carleman's approach by determing the maximamum value μN of [formula] subject to the constraint [formula] using Lagrange multipliers. It is easy to see that we may assume an  >  0 for all 1  ≤  n  ≤  N when the maximamum is reached. We now define where [formula]. By the Lagrange method, we have to solve [formula], or the following system of equations:

[formula]

We note that on summing over 1  ≤  k  ≤  N of the first N equations above, we get Hence we have μ  =  μN in this case which allows us to recast the equations [\eqref=2.1] as: On subtracting consecutive equations, we can rewrite the above system of equations as:

Now we define for 1  ≤  k  ≤  N - 1, so that we can further rewrite our system of equations as: It is easy to check that for 1  ≤  k  ≤  N - 2, We now define a sequence of real functions Ωk(μ) inductively by setting Ω1(μ) = 1 / μ and

[formula]

We note that Ωk(μN) = ωk for 1  ≤  k  ≤  N - 1 and

[formula]

We now show by induction that if μ  >  eM, then for any k  ≥  1,

[formula]

As we have seen above that ΩN(μN) = ΛN  /  λN, this forces μN  ≤  eM and hence our assertion for Theorem [\ref=thm1] will follow.

Now, to establish [\eqref=2.3], we note first the case k = 1 follows directly from our assumption [\eqref=5] on considering the case n = 1 there. Suppose now [\eqref=2.3] holds for k  ≥  1, then by the relation [\eqref=2.2], we have

[formula]

This implies that The last inequality follows from the case n = k + 1 of our assumption [\eqref=5] and this completes the proof.

An Application of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

Our goal in this section is to establish the following:

Inequality [\eqref=1] holds for λk = kα for 0  <  α < 1 with C = 1 / (α + 1).

We need a lemma first:

[\cite=L&S] For an integer n  ≥  1 and 0  ≤  r  ≤  1,

Now we return to the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2]. It suffices to check that condition [\eqref=5] is satisfied with M = 1 / (α + 1) there. Explicitly, we need to show that for any integer n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Now we apply Lemma [\ref=lem0] to obtain: We use this together with the upper bound in Lemma [\ref=lem0] to see that inequality [\eqref=3.1] is a consequence of the following inequality:

[formula]

We now define Note that inequality [\eqref=3.2] is equivalent to f(1 / n)  ≥  0. Hence it suffices to show that f(x) > 0 for 0  <  x  ≤  1. Calculation shows that where Note that when 0 < α < 1, It follows that

[formula]

It is easy to see that h(x) is concave for 0  ≤  x  ≤  1 and h(0) = 1 - α > 0,h(1) = 1 - α(1 - α2) > 0. It follows that h(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 so that g(x) > 0 and hence f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1. As f(0) = 0, this implies f(x)  ≥  0 for 0 < x  ≤  1 and this completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2].
