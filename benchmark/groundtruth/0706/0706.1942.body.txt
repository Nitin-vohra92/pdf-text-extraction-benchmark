On Jordan Derivations of Triangular algebras

Introduction

Suppose that A is an algebra over a commutative ring R. An R-linear map δ from A to an A-module M is said to be a derivation if δ(ab) = δ(a)b + aδ(b) for any a,b∈A. We call δ a Jordan derivation if δ(a2) = δ(a)a + aδ(a) for each a∈A. Obviously, every derivation is a derivation. But the inverse, in general, is not true (see [\cite=ben]).

It is natural and very interesting to find some conditions under which each Jordan derivation is a derivation. The first result on this direction was due to Herstein in 1957. He proved that every Jordan derivation on a 2-torsion free prime ring is a derivation. In 1988, Bre[formula]ar generalized Herstein's result to Jordan derivations of semiprime rings ([\cite=bresar]). Recently, Zhang and Yu ([\cite=zhang]) showed that every Jordan derivation of a triangular algebra is a derivation. More precisely, they proved the following result.

([\cite=zhang]) Let A,B be unital algebras over a 2-torsion free commutative ring R, and M be a unital (A,B)-bimodule that is faithful as a left A-module and also as a right B-module. Then every Jordan derivation from the triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B) into itself is a derivation.

Note that this result requires that both A and B are unital, and the proof is heavily dependent on

The aim of this short note is to generalize Theorem [\ref=zhangtheorem] to more general case. We want to mention here that we do not require the existence of identities for both A and B and our approach is quite different from that in [\cite=zhang].

We now introduce some definitions and notations. Recall that a triangular algebra T = Tri(A,M,B) is an algebra of the form

under the usual matrix operations, where A and B are two algebras over a commutative ring R, and M is an (A,B)-bimodule which is faithful as a left A-module and also as a right B-module (see [\cite=cheung]).

Throughout this paper, we set and Then we may write [formula], and every element a∈T can be written as a = a11 + a12 + a22. Note that notation aij denotes an arbitrary element of Tij.

Jordan derivation of triangular algebras

Throughout this section, A and B will be two algebras over a 2-torsion free commutative ring R with the property:

(P) Suppose that a∈A (resp. B). If xay + yax = 0 holds for all x,y∈A (resp. B), then a = 0.

Map δ will be a Jordan derivation from triangular algebra T = Tri(A,M,B) into itself, where M is a faithful (A,B)-bimodule.

We begin with the following useful lemma.

Let a be in A (resp. B).

(i) If xax = 0 for any x∈A (resp. B), then a = 0;

(ii) If ax + xa = 0 for any x∈A (resp. B), then a = 0.

(i) It follows directly from Property (P).

(ii) For arbitrary x,y∈A, multiplying ax + xa = 0 from the left and the right by y respectively and adding them together, we obtain

[formula]

This leads to

[formula]

Furthermore, we have

[formula]

By Property (P), we see that a = 0.

The following result is given by Herstein.

Let δ be a Jordan derivation on a 2-torsion free ring R into itself. For any a,b,c∈R, the following hold.

(i) δ(ab + ba) = δ(a)b + aδ(b) + δ(b)a + bδ(a);

(ii) δ(aba) = δ(a)ba + aδ(b)a + abδ(a);

(iii) δ(abc + cba) = δ(a)bc + aδ(b)c + abδ(c) + δ(c)ba + cδ(b)a + cbδ(a).

For arbitrary a11∈T11 and b22∈T22, we have

(i) δ(a11)22 = 0;

(ii) δ(b22)11 = 0;

(iii) δ(a11b22) = δ(a11b22) + a11δ(b22);

(iv) δ(b22a11) = δ(b22)a11 + b22δ(a11).

We compute

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=jj], we have δ(a11)22  =  δ(b22)11 = 0.

Now (iii) and (iv) follows easily.

For any a12∈T12, the following are true.

(i) δ(a12)11 = 0;

(ii) δ(a12)22 = 0.

For arbitrary b11∈T11, we have

[formula]

It follows from Lemma [\ref=jj] that δ(a12)11 = 0.

Similarly, we can get δ(a12)22 = 0 by considering δ(b22a12b22) for any b22∈T22.

For any a11∈T11 and b12∈T12,

(i) δ(b12a11) = δ(b12)a11 + b12δ(a11);

(ii) δ(a11b12) = δ(a11)b12 + a11δ(b12).

(i) Note that

[formula]

(ii) We have

[formula]

Similarly, we have

For arbitrary a12∈T12 and b22∈T22,

(i) δ(a12b22) = δ(a12)b22 + a12δ(b22);

(ii) δ(b22a12) = δ(b22)a12 + b12δ(a12).

δ is a derivation on T12.

For any a12,b12∈T12, by Lemma [\ref=12], we have

[formula]

δ is a derivation on T11.

Let a11,b11∈T11, and c12∈T12 be arbitrary. On one side, we have

[formula]

On the other side, we get

[formula]

Then we can infer that

[formula]

This yields that δ(a11b11) = δ(a11)b11 + a11δ(b11) since M is a faithful left A-module.

In the similar manner, one can get

δ is a derivation of T22.

Now we can get our main result of this note.

Let A and B be two algebras over a 2-torsion free commutative ring R with the property:

(P) Suppose that a∈A (resp. B). If xay + yax = 0 holds for all x,y∈A (resp. B), then a = 0.

Let M be a faithful (A,B)-bimodule and T be the triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B). Then every Jordan derivation δ on T into itself is a derivation.

It follows from Lemmas [\ref=1122]-[\ref=22].

We end this note with the following remark.

It is easy to see that Theorem [\ref=zhangtheorem] is a special case of Theorem [\ref=theorem] when both A and B are unital. In other words, our result is a generalization of Theorem [\ref=zhangtheorem].
