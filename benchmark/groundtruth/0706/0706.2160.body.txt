Minimality in topological groups and Heisenberg type groups

Introduction

A Hausdorff topological group G is minimal if G does not admit a strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology or equivalently if every injective continuous group homomorphism G  →  P into a Hausdorff topological group is a topological embedding. The concept of minimal topological groups was introduced by Stephenson [\cite=STE71] and Doï chinov [\cite=DOI72] in 1971 as a natural generalization of compact groups.

Heisenberg group and more precisely its generalization, which we present in section  [\ref=sec:mgh] (see also [\cite=MIL89] [\cite=REI74]), provides many examples of minimal groups.

Recently Dikranjan and Megrelishvili [\cite=DIM04] introduced the concept of co-minimality (see Definition  [\ref=def:com]) of subgroups in topological groups after the latter author had introduced the concept of relative minimality (see Definition  [\ref=def:rel] and also [\cite=MEG04]) of subgroups in topological groups and found such subgroups in a generalized Heisenberg group (see [\cite=MIL89] [\cite=REI74]).

In [\cite=DIM04] Megrelishvili and Dikranjan proved that the canonical bilinear mapping [formula] is strongly minimal (see Definition  [\ref=def:stm]) for all normed spaces V.

The following result is obtained as a particular case: The inner product map

[formula]

is strongly minimal. The latter result leads in [\cite=DIM04] and [\cite=MEG04] to the conclusion that for every [formula] the subgroups

[formula]

are relatively minimal in the group

[formula]

which is known as the classical 2n + 1-dimensional Heisenberg group (where In denotes the identity matrix of size n). Theorem  [\ref=thm:new] and Corollary  [\ref=cor:nrs] generalize these results and allow us to replace the field of reals by every other archimedean absolute valued (not necessarily associative) division ring, for example, they can be applied for the ring of quaternions and the ring of octonions. Theorem  [\ref=thm:ne2] provides a different generalization. It generalizes the case of the classical real 3-dimensional Heisenberg group. We consider for every [formula] the group of upper unitriangular matrices over an archimedean absolute valued field of size n + 2  ×  n + 2 and we find relatively minimal subgroups of this group. This result is a generalization since the classical real 3-dimensional Heisenberg group is a unitriangular group. This theorem is not new when we take n = 1 and consider the field to reals. However, we obtain a new result even for [formula] when we take n > 1. This theorem can also be applied for the fields [formula] and [formula]

Minimality in Generalized Heisenberg groups

The group

[formula]

is known as the classical real 3-dimensional Heisenberg Group.

We need a far reaching generalization [\cite=MIL89] [\cite=REI74] [\cite=MEG04], the generalized Heisenberg group, which is based on biadditive mappings.

[\cite=MEG04] The subgroups X and [formula] are relatively minimal in the generalized Heisenberg group [formula] for every normed space X.

The concept of co-minimality which is presented below played a major role in generalizing and strengthen Theorem  [\ref=thm:rel]. Let H be a subgroup of a topological group (G,γ). The quotient topology on the left coset space G / H: = {gH}g∈G will be denoted by γ / H.

The multiplication map A  ×  A  →  A is minimal for every Hausdorff topological unital ring A. However note that the multiplication map [formula] (being minimal) is not strongly minimal.

The following theorem which uses the concept of co-minimality and strongly biadditive mappings generalizes Theorem  [\ref=thm:rel].

[\cite=DIM04] Let w:(E,σ)  ×  (F,τ)  →  (A,ν) be a strongly minimal biadditive mapping. Then: 1. A, A  ×  E and A  ×  F are co-minimal subgroups of the Heisenberg group H(w). 2. E  ×  F is a relatively minimal subset in H(w). 3. The subgroups E and F are relatively minimal in H(w).

The mapping [formula] (x,f)  ↦  f(x) is strongly minimal for every normed space X. Therefore, Theorem  [\ref=thm:gen] is indeed a generalization of Theorem  [\ref=thm:rel].

[\cite=DIM04] The following conditions are equivalent:

H(w) is a minimal group.

w is a minimal biadditive mapping and A is a minimal group.

Since [formula] with the p-adic topology τp is a minimal group for every prime p [\cite=PRO71] the following corollary is obtained by Remark  [\ref=rem:stm]:

[\cite=DIM04] The Heisenberg group [formula] of the mapping [formula] is a minimal two step nilpotent precompact group for every p-adic topology τp.

Topological rings and absolute values

In this paper rings are not assumed to be necessarily associative. However, when we consider division rings we assume they are associative unless otherwise is stated.

From now on we use the following notations for a commutative group G which is denoted additively: the zero element is denoted by 0G. If G is also a ring with multiplicative unit we denote this element by 1G. In the case of a group G which is a direct product of groups we shall use slightly different notation and denote the zero element by G.

Let X be a (not necessarily associative) division ring with an archimedean absolute value A and denote by τ the ring topology induced by the absolute value. Let σ  ⊂  τ be a strictly coarser group topology with respect to the additive structure of X. Then, every σ-neighborhood of 0X is unbounded with respect to the absolute value.

Since σ is strictly coarser than τ, there exists an open ball B(0,r) with r > 0 not containing any σ-neighborhood of 0X. Then, for every σ-neighborhood U of 0X there exists x in U such that A(x)  ≥  r. Fix a σ-neighborhood V of 0X. We show that V is unbounded with respect to the absolute value A. Since A is an archimedean absolute value there exists [formula] such that A(n0) = c > 1. Clearly, for every [formula] there exists a σ-neighborhood W of 0X such that

[formula]

By our assumption there exists x∈W such that A(x)  ≥  r. Now for the element

[formula]

we obtain that A(nm0x) = A(n0)mA(x)  ≥  cmr. This clearly means that V is unbounded.

Let (Gi)i∈I be a family of topological groups. For each i∈I denote by τi the topology of Gi and by pi the projection of [formula] to Gi. Suppose that σ is a group topology on G which is strictly coarser than the product topology on G denoted by τ. Then there exist j∈I and a group topology σj on Gj which is strictly coarser than τj, such that [formula], where [formula] is the neighborhood filter of 0Gj with respect to σj and [formula] is the neighborhood filter of G with respect to σ.

Since the topology σ is strictly coarser than τ which is the product topology on G, we get that there exists j∈I for which the projection pj:(G,σ)  →  (Gj,τj) is not continuous at G. Hence, there exist a τj-neighborhood V of 0Gj such that [formula] for every [formula]. Hence, if [formula] is the neighborhood filter of 0Gj for some group topology σj on Gj then this topology is strictly coarser than τj. We shall prove that this formulation defines a group topology σj. Indeed, consider the normal subgroup [formula] of G where

[formula]

It is easy to show that (Gj,τj) is topologically isomorphic to the quotient group G / H of (G,τ). Let σj be the finest topology on Gj for which the projection pj:(G,σ)  →  Gj is continuous. It is exactly the quotient topology on Gj = G / H for the topological group (G,σ). By our construction σj is strictly coarser than τj. Then indeed σj is the desired group topology on Gj and [formula] is the desired neighborhood filter.

Let F be a (not necessarily associative) division ring furnished with an archimedean absolute value A. For each [formula],

[formula]

(where [formula] is a strongly minimal biadditive mapping.

Clearly, for each [formula] is a continuous separated biadditive mapping. Denote by τ the topology of F induced by A and by τn the product topology on Fn. Consider the max-metric d on Fn. Then its topology is exactly τn. Let (σ,σ',ν) be a compatible triple with respect to wn. We prove that σ  =  σ' = τn. Assuming the contrary we get that at least one of the group topologies σ,σ' is strictly coarser than τn. We first assume that σ is strictly coarser than τn. Since ν is Hausdorff and (σ,σ',ν) is compatible there exist a ν-neighborhood Y of 0: = 0F and V,W which are respectively σ,σ'-neighborhoods of Fn such that VW  ⊂  Y and in addition 1F∉Y. Since W∈σ'  ⊂  τn, then there exists ε0 > 0 such that the corresponding d-ball B(0,ε0) is a subset of W. Since σ is strictly coarser than τn (by Lemmas [\ref=l:unbounded_nbd] and [\ref=l:prod]) there exists [formula] such that pi(V) is norm unbounded. Therefore, there exists x̄∈V such that [formula]. Hence, A((pi(x̄))- 1) < ε0. Now, let us consider a vector ā∈Fn such that for every j  ≠  i, aj = 0 and ai = (pi(x̄))- 1. Clearly, ā∈B(0,ε0)  ⊂  W. We then get that wn(x̄,ā) = 1F∈VW  ⊂  Y. This contradicts our assumption. Using the same technique we can show that σ' can't be strictly coarser than τn.

Let [formula] with the usual absolute value. Then for each [formula] the map

[formula]

is strongly minimal. The case of F equals to [formula] follows also from [\cite=DIM04].

For each [formula] the map

[formula]

is strongly minimal, where [formula] is the quaternions ring equipped with the archimedean absolute value defined by:

[formula]

for each [formula]

Let G be the non-associative ring of octonions.

This ring can be defined (see [\cite=WIK07]) as pairs of quaternions (this is the Cayley-Dickson construction). Addition is defined pairwise. The product of two pairs of quaternions (a,b) and (c,d) is defined by [formula] where [formula] denotes the conjugate of z = e + fi + gj + hk. We define a norm on G as follows:

[formula]

This norm agrees with the standard Euclidean norm on [formula]. It can be proved that for each [formula] hence [formula] is an absolute value and clearly it is archimedean. Again by Theorem [\ref=thm:new] the map

[formula]

is strongly minimal for each [formula].

Under the conditions of Theorem  [\ref=thm:new] we obtain the following results:

[formula] and [formula] are co-minimal subgroups of the Heisenberg group H(wn).

[formula] is a relatively minimal subset in H(wn) .

The subgroups [formula] and [formula] are relatively minimal in H(wn).

Apply Theorem  [\ref=thm:gen] to the strongly minimal biadditive mapping wn.

We replace H(wn) by H(Fn) for convenience (wn is the strongly minimal biadditive mapping from  [\ref=thm:new]). In terms of matrices: H(Fn) is the 2n + 1-dimensional Heisenberg group with coefficients from F which consists of square matrices of size n + 2:

[formula]

and by the result (2) of Corollary  [\ref=cor:nrs] we obtain that the set of matrices

[formula]

is a relatively minimal subset of H(Fn).

If H is a subgroup of a topological group (G,τ) and X is a relatively minimal subset in H, then X is also relatively minimal in G.

Let (G1,τ1),(G2,τ2) be topological groups and H1,H2 be their subgroups (respectively). If H1 is relatively minimal in G1 and there exists a topological isomorphism f:(G1,τ1)  →  (G2,τ2) such that the restriction to H1 is a topological isomorphism onto H2, then H2 is relatively minimal in G2.

Let (G,τ) be a topological group and let X be a subset of G. If X is relatively minimal in (G,τ), then every subset of X is also relatively minimal in (G,τ).

(1): Let σ  ⊂  τ be a coarser Hausdorff group topology of G, then [formula] is a coarser Hausdorff group topology of H. Since X is a relatively minimal subset in H, we get that

[formula]

Hence, X is relatively minimal in G. (2): Observe that if σ2  ⊂  τ2 is a coarser Hausdorff group topology of G2, then

[formula]

is a coarser group topology of G1. Since H1 is relatively minimal in (G1,τ1) we obtain that [formula] This implies that [formula] This completes our proof. (3): Let Y be a subset of X and σ  ⊂  τ a coarser Hausdorff group topology. Then, by the fact that X is relatively minimal in (G,τ) and since Y is a subset of X we obtain that

[formula]

Hence, Y is relatively minimal in G.

The following is new even for the case of [formula] (for n > 1).

Let F be a field furnished with an archimedean absolute value A. For all [formula] denote by Un + 2(F) the topological group of all n + 2  ×  n + 2 upper unitriangular matrices with entries from F. Then [formula] and for each i,j such that i < j, (i,j)  ≠  (1,n + 2) each of the subgroups

[formula]

(where aij is in the ij entry) is relatively minimal in Un + 2(F).

We prove the assertion for two cases: First case: i = 1 or j = n + 2 (that is the indexes from the first row or from the last column) and the second case: i > 1, j < n + 2. Let us consider the first case: we know by Remark  [\ref=rem:nrs] that the set S of square matrices of size n + 2:

[formula]

is relatively minimal in H(Fn). Since H(Fn) is a subgroup of Un + 2(F) we get by Lemma  [\ref=lem:rms] that S is relatively minimal in Un + 2(F). Now, Gn + 21j(F)  ⊂  S for every 1 < j < n + 2 and Gn + 2in + 2(F)  ⊂  S for every 1 < i < n + 2. By Lemma  [\ref=lem:rms] we obtain that Gn + 2ij(F) is relatively minimal in Un + 2(F) for every pair of indexes (i,j) such that i = 1 or j = n + 2 (in addition to the demands: i < j and(i,j)  ≠  (1,n + 2)). Case 2: i > 1, j < n + 2. Fix n∈N and a pair (i,j) such that 1 < i < j < n + 2. We shall show that Gn + 2ij(F) is relatively minimal in Un + 2(F). We define the following subgroup of Un + 2(F):

[formula]

(it means that the first i - 1 rows of every matrix contain only 0F at each entry (besides the diagonal)). Clearly, this group is isomorphic to the group U(n + 2 - (i - 1))(F) = Un + 3 - i(F). Indeed, for every matrix A∈Ũn + 2(F) if we delete the first i - 1 rows and the first i - 1 columns we obtain a matrix which belongs to Un + 3 - i(F) and it also clear that this way we obtain an isomorphism. Denote this isomorphism by f. Now, Gn + 2ij(F) is a subgroup of Ũn + 2(F) and f(Gn + 2ij(F)) = Gn + 3 - i1j + 1 - i(F). Since 1 < i < j < n + 2 we obtain that i  ≤  n and hence n + 3 - i  ≥  3. Therefore, we can use the reduction to case (1) to obtain that Gn + 3 - i1j + 1 - i(F) is relatively minimal in Un + 3 - i(F). By applying Lemma  [\ref=lem:rms] (with G1: = Un + 3 - i(F), G2: = Ũn + 2(F), H1: = Gn + 3 - i1j + 1 - i(F) and H2: = Gn + 2ij(F)) we can conclude that Gn + 2ij(F) is relatively minimal in Ũn + 2(F) and hence also in Un + 2(F) which contains Ũn + 2(F) as a subgroup. This completes our proof.

In the particular case of [formula] we obtain by previous results that for every [formula] each of the subgroups [formula] is relatively minimal in [formula]). It is derived from the fact that [formula]) is minimal for every [formula] (see [\cite=RES91] [\cite=DIM04]). These groups are also relatively minimal in [formula]) which contains [formula]) as a subgroup (see Lemma  [\ref=lem:rms]). Nevertheless, the fact that these groups are relatively minimal in [formula]) is not derived from the minimality of [formula]) since [formula] is contained in [formula] and not the opposite (that is [formula]) is not a subset of [formula]).

[\cite=WAR93] A nondiscrete locally retrobounded division ring is straight. In particular, a division ring topologized by a proper absolute value is straight.

Let (F,τ) be a unital Hausdorff topological ring. Consider the following cases:

(F,τ) is a minimal topological group.

The multiplication map w:(F,τ)  ×  (F,τ)  →  (F,τ) is strongly minimal.

(F,τ) is minimal as a topological module over (F,τ) (i.e. there is no strictly coarser Hausdorff topology σ on F for which (F,σ) is a topological module over (F,τ)).

(F,τ) is minimal as a topological ring (i.e. there is no strictly coarser Hausdorff ring topology on F).

Then:

[formula]

(1)  ⇒  (2): If F is a unital topological ring then w is minimal. Indeed, let (σ1,τ1,ν1) be a compatible triple then the identity maps (F,σ1)  →  (F,τ) and (F,τ1)  →  (F,τ) are continuous since the multiplication map w:(F,σ1)  ×  (F,τ1)  →  (F,τ) is continuous at (λ,1F),(1F,λ) for every λ∈F and from the fact that

[formula]

Clearly, in the case of a minimal topological Hausdorff group the definition of a minimal biadditive mapping and a strongly minimal biadditive mapping coincide. The rest of the implications are trivial.

Although (1)  ⇒  (2), the converse implication in general is not true. For instance, the multiplication map [formula] is strongly minimal but [formula] is not minimal as a topological Hausdorff group.

Let (R,τ) be a straight division ring. Let τ0 be a strictly coarser Hausdorff topology on τ. Then (R,τ0) is not a topological vector space over (R,τ).

Let τ0  ⊂  τ. We shall show that if (R,τ0) is a topological vector space then τ0  =  τ. In the definition of straight division ring let K = (R,τ) and E = (R,τ0) also let c = 1. Then it is clear that the identity mapping (R,τ)  →  (R,τ0) is a homeomorphism. Hence, τ  =  τ0.

By our new results we get that in the case of archimedean absolute value, conditions (2)-(4) of Lemma  [\ref=lem:map] hold. Since a proper non-archimedean absolute valued division ring is a straight division ring we get by Lemma  [\ref=lem:fin] that the conditions (3)-(4) in Lemma  [\ref=lem:map] hold in this situation. The question that remains open is whether the multiplication map

[formula]

is strongly minimal where F is a division ring and the topology τ is induced by a proper non-archimedean absolute value. We ask even more concretely: is the multiplication map

[formula]

strongly minimal when [formula] is equipped with the p-adic topology?
