A multi band study of the optically dark GRB 051028

Introduction

In recent years, the BeppoSAX and HETE-2 have provided quick positional information for a number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with a typical positional accuracy of [formula], which has led to rapid follow-up observations in the optical and near infrared frequencies. The Swift satellite has opened the door to the making of high sensitivity X-ray afterglow observations with an X-ray telescope in the early stage of the afterglows. This revealed that almost all of the GRBs had an X-ray afterglow: the positions of the GRBs could be measured within a precision of 10 arcseconds. Nevertheless, the afterglow associated with about half of the promptly localized GRBs was either very faint (>   23 mag 1 day after the burst; Fynbo et al. 2001), or non-existent [\citep=hete-2]. Such events are broadly termed "optically dark GRBs". To be more precise, in this paper we define a GRB to be "optically dark" if its optical afterglow is fainter than 23 mag at 1 day after the burst. Typical optically dark GRBs include GRB030115 and GRB021211. The afterglow of GRB030115 was extremely red; although a near infrared counterpart with K  ~  19 was detected 1 day after the burst, no optical afterglow brighter than 20 mag. was detected, even at 0.1 days. In the case of GRB021211, the afterglow showed a rapid decay until around 0.1 days, fading to > 22 mag. by the next day.

The observations of the afterglow of a GRB via X-rays, through radio frequencies can be interpreted by the fireball models. In general a shock produced by the interaction of relativistic ejecta with the circumburst medium will lead to the radiation of broadband synchrotron emission. Assuming this widely accepted hypothesis to be true, there are three possible explanations for optically dark GRBs: (1) They have such high redshifts (z > 5) that optical afterglows suffer from strong Lyman absorption [\citep=Heise2]: (2) The optical afterglow has been extinguished by dust in the vicinity of the GRB or in the star-forming region in which the GRB occurs (Piro et al. 2002; Klose et al. 2002): (3)The optical afterglow exhibits rapid decay from a very early phase, such as has been reported for GRB021211 and GRB020124 (Crew et al 2003, Berger et al 2002, Yamazaki et al 2003).

In this paper we present an analysis of the optical and X-ray afterglow of an optically dark event, GRB 051028. At 13:36:01.47 UT on 28 Oct 2005, the HETE-2 FREGATE and WXM [\citep=wxm] instruments detected a bright GRB [\citep=hete]. The burst triggered the operation of FREGATE in the 30-400 keV energy band. The burst duration (T90) was 16 seconds in both the 30-400 keV band and the 7-30 keV band. Ground analysis of the WXM data found a 90% confidence error region measuring [formula] with corners at the following coordinates: [formula], [formula], [formula], and α(2000) = 01h50m 17s.5, [formula]. The 30-400 keV fluence of GRB 051028 is 6  ×  10- 6erg  /  cm2 ; the 2-30 keV fluences is 6  ×  10- 7erg  /  cm2. The hardness ratio allows us to classify this burst as a classical GRB [\citep=hete]. Swift XRT started to observe the field about 7.1 hours after the burst and found the X-ray afterglow at [formula] with an uncertainty of 6'' (90% containment) [\citep=swift]. The optical afterglow was also reported by [\citet=ot] at the coordinates of [formula].

Observations

Optical observations were made by the East-Asia GRB Follow-up Observation Network (EAFON; [\cite=eafon]) using two kinds of telescopes.

Pre-GRB observation with WIDGET

We observed the error region of GRB 051028 [\citep=hete] with the very wide-field camera WIDGET (Abe et al 2006; Tamagawa et al 2005). WIDGET is a robotic telescope. It monitors the HETE-2 field-of-view and can detect GRB optical flashes or possible optical precursors. The filed-of-view is [formula], which covers about 80% of the HETE2 WXM observing field. The system consists of a 2k×  2k Apogee U10 CCD camera and a Canon EF 24mm f/1.4 wide-angle lens. WIDGET has been in operation at the Akeno site (Latitude and Longtitude are [formula] and [formula], respectively) since June 2004. WIDGET monitored the GRB 051028 region by repeated unfiltered 5-second exposures taken 16.0 min and 11.2 min before the burst [\citep=widget2].

Follow-up observation at Lulin

We started optical follow-up observations using Lulin's One-meter Telescope (LOT) ([\cite=lot]) 0.094 days after the burst (i.e., 12 min after the HETE-2 position alert). This is the fastest follow-up observation time possible with a meter-sizes-telescope. This telescope was installed in September 2002 on the summit of Mount Lulin ([formula] E, [formula] N, H= 2862 m) in central Taiwan by the Institute of Astronomy of National Central University. Photometric images were obtained with a PI1300B CCD camera ([formula] pixels: [formula] field of view). A samples is shown in figure 1. To cover the entire HETE-2 WXM error box ([formula]), we imaged the 8-field mosaic with 300 sec exposures in the R band. Due to the darkness and to there being no clear variability during the early part of our observations as shown in figure 2, we could not quickly identify the afterglow by analysis at the observing site. The obtained R band data is described in Table 1.

Analysis and Results

WIDGET

The data reduction of the WIDGET images were performed in the standard manner. Each WIDGET image taken around the GRB position was compared with non-saturated bright stars in the Tycho-2.0 position catalog. The rms deviation around the fit to the positions of 8 reference stars was 231''. We did not find any optical emission from the afterglow position (Jelinek et al. GCN 4175). The 1-sigma limiting magnitude of each frame derived from the Tycho-2 catalog was around V=10.3 mag.

LOT

A standard routine, including bias subtraction, dark subtraction, and flat-fielding corrections with appropriate calibration data was employed to process the data using IRAF. As shown in figure 1, the afterglow can clearly be seen in the R band images. Flux calibrations were performed using the APPHOT package in IRAF, referring to the standard stars suggested by Henden (2005). For each data set, the one-dimensional aperture size was set to 4 times as large as the full-width at half maximum of the objects. The magnitude of error for each optical image is estimated as σ2e  =  σ2ph  +  σ2sys, where σph represents the photometric errors for the GRB051028 afterglow, estimated from the output of IRAF PHOT, and σsys is the photometric calibration error estimated by comparing our instrumental magnitudes for the 7 standard stars over the 9 frames.

Figure 2 shows the R band light curve of the GRB 051028 afterglow. There is a clear plateau phase seen about 0.1 days after the burst. This early phase plateau is often seen in optically bright afterglows, such as with GRB 041006 (Urata et al. 2006), GRB 021004 (Urata et al. 2006) and GRB 050319 (Huang et al 2006). Around 0.11 days after the burst, the optical afterglow started to decay. We tried to fit the decaying R band light curves using as a simple power law of the time t after the onset of the burst, tα, where α is the decay index. We have obtained [formula] with a reduced chi-squared (χ2  /  ν) of 0.029 for ν  =   1. In order to better constrain the late-time (>   0.3 day) behavior of the light curve, we combined our data with the two Rc-band photometric points taken by the Willam Herschel telescope; R=21.97  ±  0.05 mag. at 0.337 day, and R=22.8±  0.3 mag. at 0.625 day [\citep=castro]. We again successfully fitted the combined R band light curve with a single power law, for which the decay index is [formula] with χ2  /  ν=0.33 for ν = 3.

Swift/XRT

In order to compare the X-ray afterglow with the optical afterglow, we also analyzed X-ray data taken by Swift/XRT. The data for GRB 051028 were downloaded from the Swift archive and reduced by running version 0.10.3 of the xrtpipeline reduction script from the HEAsoft 6.0.6 software package. However for the four series of observations, the significance was close to 3 σ, less than expected from 1 set of XRT data. We then analyzed only the first set of XRT data, for which observation started at 7.1 hours after the burst. Spectral response files were generated using the xrtmkarf task and the latest calibration database files (CALDB version 8, 2006-04-27).

The X-ray light curve in the 0.5 - 5.0 keV band is a reasonably fit to a power law model with [formula] and χ2 / dof = 1.00 / 7, which is consistent or slightly steeper than that of the optical value. The 0.5 - 5.0 keV spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power law where the photon index Γ = 2.3+ 0.5- 0.4 with an absorbing column of [formula] and χ2 / dof = 0.67 / 19. According to [\citet=nh], the galactic column density of this line of sight is estimated to be [formula]. The mean flux during the observation is [formula] erg/cm2/s, which is about 1 order fainter than those of optically bright GRB's X-ray afterglows, such as GRB 050319[\citep=x050319], GRB 051111[\citep=x051111] and GRB 060124[\citep=x060124]. These light curve and spectrum analyses indicate that this X-ray afterglow behavior agrees with the standard model in terms of the relation between the temporal and spectral indices, assuming that we are observing a spherical fireball in a frequency range above that of synchrotron cooling (Sari et al. 1999).

Discussion

LOT was used to detect the optically dim afterglow of GRB 051028. The brightness around 0.1 days after the burst is about 3 magnitudes fainter than that of the dark GRB 020124 [\citep=berger]. The temporal evolution of the optical afterglow shows a plateau phase around 0.1 days after the burst. These features, with the exception of the brightness, resemble those of recent optically bright afterglows. The X-ray afterglow is also 1 order fainter than those of optically bright GRB's X-ray afterglow. In contrast with one typical, optically dark event, GRB 021211, the light curve of GRB 051028 shows the usual pattern of temporal decay, with an index of α =  - 0.904. This is different from optically dark GRBs, which show rapid decay from very early phases, such as for GRB 021211.

The optical darkness of the GRB 051028 optical afterglow may instead be a result of high circumburst extinction. However the column density NH shows no significant excess against the Galactic value. The observed NH (90% confidence level) is consistent with that of the Galactic value. Since this value is insufficient to explain the optical darkness of dark GRBs, the extinction model of optically dark GRBs is also not applicable to the present case. These results are supported the SCUBA observations of several dark GRBs: the sub-mm results suggest that the optically dark GRBs do not occur in particularly dusty environments [\citep=submm].

Although the redshift of GRB 051028 was not determined from optical spectroscopic observation, a value of pseudo-[formula] can be derived for this burst using the pseudo-z estimator developed by Pelangeon et al (2006). Even assuming the highest allowed redshift (z = 5.5), the Lyα line and continuum absorption is expected to affect the R band flux of the afterglow only by [formula] mag. In this calculation, the optical depth is calculated following [\citet=yoshii], and the spectral index, as computed from the X-ray afterglow, is fixed at β =  - 1.3. This calculation also successfully explains the drop in the B band in the spectra of the GRB 050319 (z = 3.24) afterglow [\citep=050319]. Since the expected R band absorption is not high enough to explain the darkness of the afterglow, it is inappropriate to use the high-z scenario for optically dark GRBs, at least for the particular case of GRB 051028. The afterglow spectral index βox at 11 hours after the burst derived from X-ray and optical data is also usefull indicator of the opticall darkness as Jakobsson et al (2004). For the current event, the index βox  ~   - 0.6 agrees with the standard afterglow model and imply that the optical darkness is unlikely to support high-z and obscuration.

The above discussion suggests that the brightness of the GRB 051028 afterglow is intrinsically optically dark although the prompt fluence is brighter than that of optically bright events, such as GRB 021004. The brightness of X-ray afterglow also supports this hypothesis. Figure 5 shows the R band brightness at 0.1 days against the prompt fluence. It can be seen that they have the same redshift range as does GRB 051028 ([formula]) detected by HETE-2. This result implies that the afterglow emission mechanism or the energy conversion to the afterglows may be the origin of the darkness. Swift has formulated the canonical X-ray afterglow behavior, which has led to the observation of early optical afterglows. These X-ray and optical light curves show rapid and shallow decay in the early phase. These various variablities may be explained by the standard forward shock scenario, with some additional components, such as continuous activities related to the central engine, energy injection, patch shell and 2 jet models (e.g. [\citet=ioka]). The t< 0.1 days plateau phase of GRB 051028 could be explained by energy injection within the context of forward shock model. In a case of less energy input, there are two expected features: (1) the brightness of the optical afterglow will be dim, and (2) the temporal behavior will have a shorter shallow decay phase than those of bright afterglows, which is similar to the pure standard model. The shallow decay period of the current GRB 051028 is obviously less than that of the bright afterglow. While the bright event of GRB 050319 has a longer shallow decay phase (~  1days), the afterglow of GRB 051028 shows the classical temporal decay pattern (α =  - 0.9) from 0.1 days after the burst.

Conclusion

We made optical observations using both WIDGET and the Lulin 1 m telescope. Based on our optical follow-up observation, it can be seen that the optical afterglow shows a possible plateau phase at 0.1 days, which is similar in behavior but not in brightness to optically bright afterglows (e.g. GRB 041006, Urata et al. 2007; GRB 050319, Huang et al. 2007; GRB 060605, Deng et al. 2007). The brightness is 3 magnitudes fainter than that of the optically dark GRB 020124. The X-ray spectrum analysis implies that there is no significant extinction by the host galaxy. Furthermore, according to the model calculation of Lyα absorption limit of GRB 051028's redshift, the expected R band absorption is not high enough to explain the darkness of the afterglow. These arguments indicate that the faintness of the afterglow of GRB 051028, that is the optically darkness of the burst, is not due to its being obscured by dust but because it is intrinsically dim.
