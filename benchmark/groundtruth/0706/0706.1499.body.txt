Elementary Maps on Triangular algebras

The study of elementary maps was initiated by Bre[formula]ar and [formula]erml. Following ([\cite=br1115]), elementary maps are defined as follows.

Let R and [formula] be two rings. Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are two maps. Call the ordered pair (M,M*) an elementary map of [formula] if for all a,b∈R and [formula].

Notice that no additivity of M and M* is required in the above definition.

It is very interesting that elementary maps on some rings as well as operator algebras are automatically additive. In recent years, the study of additivity of maps on rings and operator algebras has become an active topic which has enriched the theory of maps on rings and operator algebras.

The first result about the additivity of maps on rings was due to Martindale III. In [\cite=ma695], he proved the following result.

([\cite=ma695]) Let R be a ring containing a family {eα:α∈Λ} of idempotents which satisfies:

(i) xR  =  {0} implies x = 0;

(ii) If eαRx = {0} for each α∈Λ, then x = 0 (and hence Rx = {0} implies x = 0);

(iii) For each α∈Λ, eαxeαR(1 - eα) = {0} implies eαxeα = 0.

Then any multiplicative bijective map from R onto an arbitrary ring [formula] is additive.

As a corollary, every multiplicative bijective map from a prime ring containing a nontrivial idempotent onto an arbitrary ring is necessarily additive.

It should be mentioned here that the proof of [\cite=ma695] has become a quite standard argument and been applied widely in dealing with the additivity of a large number of maps on rings and operator algebras (see [\cite=ji]-[\cite=lu2273]).

The aim of this note is to study the additivity of elementary maps on triangular algebras. We will show that every elementary map on triangular operator is additive. Note that, different from [\cite=ma695], we do not require the existence of nontrivial idempotents. However, we still follow the line of [\cite=ma695].

Recall that a triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B) is an algebra of the form

under the usual matrix operations, where A and B are two algebras over a commutative ring R, and M is an (A,B)-bimodule which is faithful as a left A-module and also as a right B-module (see [\cite=cheung]).

We are ready to state our result of this note.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary ring. Let A and B be two algebras over a commutative ring R, M a faithful (A,B)-bimodule, and T be the triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B). Suppose that algebras A and B satisfy:

(i) If aA  =  {0}, or Aa = {0}, then a = 0;

(ii) If bB  =  {0}, or Bb = {0}, then b = 0.

Suppose that (M,M*) is an elementary map on [formula], and both M and M* are surjective. Then both M and M* are additive.

For the sake of clarity, we divide the proof into a series of lemmas. We begin with the following trivial one.

M(0) = 0 and M*(0) = 0.

We have M(0) = M(0M*(0)0) = M(0)0M(0) = 0.

Similarly, M*(0) = M*(0M(0)0) = M*(0)0M*(0) = 0.

In what follows, we set and Then we may write [formula], and every element a∈T can be written as a = a11 + a12 + a22. Note that notation aij denotes an arbitrary element of Tij.

The following result shows that both M and M* are bijective.

Both M and M* are injective.

Suppose that M(a) = M(b) for some a and b in T. We write a = a11 + a12 + a22 and b = b11 + b12 + b22.

For arbitrary x and y in [formula], we have

[formula]

This, by the surjectivity of M*, is equivalent to

[formula]

for arbitrary s,t∈T.

In particular, letting s = s11,t = tii∈T11 in equality ([\ref=01]), we get s11a11t11 = s11b11t11. And so, by condition (i) in Theorem [\ref=theorem], a11 = b11.

Similarly, we can get a22 = b22 by letting s = s22 and t = t22 in identity ([\ref=01]).

We now show that a12 = b12. Setting s = s11∈T11 and t = t22∈T22, then equality ([\ref=01]) becomes s11at22 = s11bt22, i.e., s11a12t22 = s11b12t22. Therefore a12 = b12 as M is a faithful (A,B)-bimodule.

To complete the proof, it remains to show that M* is injective. Let x and y be in [formula] such that M*(x) = M*(y). Now for any a,b∈T, we have

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Equivalently,

[formula]

for any s,t∈T since M*M is surjective.

It follows from the same argument above that M- 1(x) = M- 1(y), and so x = y, as desired.

The pair (M*  - 1,M- 1) is a Jordan elementary map on [formula]. That is, for all a,b∈T and [formula].

The first identity follows from the following observation.

[formula]

The second one goes similarly.

The following result will be used frequently in this note.

Let a,b,c∈R such that M(c) = M(a) + M(b). Then for any s,t∈T we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=inverse], we have

[formula]

Let a11∈T11 and b12∈T12, then

(i) M(a11 + b12) = M(a11) + M(b12);

(ii) M*  - 1(a11 + b12) = M*  - 1(a11) + M*  - 1(b12).

We only prove (i). We choose c∈T such that M(c) = M(a11) + M(b12). For arbitrary s11∈R11 and t22∈T22, by Lemma [\ref=add], we have

[formula]

It follows that s11ct22 = s11b12t22, i.e., s11c12t22 = s11b12t22, which yields that c12 = b12.

Now for any s11 and t11 in T11, we have

[formula]

This implies that c11 = a11.

Similarly, for any s22,t22∈T22, we obtain

[formula]

Hence c22 = 0 follows from the fact that s22ct22 = 0..

Similarly, we can get the following result.

Let a22∈T22 and b12∈T12, then

(i) M(a22 + b12) = M(a22) + M(b12);

(ii) M*  - 1(a22 + b12) = M*  - 1(a22) + M*  - 1(b12).

For any t11,a11∈T11, b12,c12∈T12, and d22∈T22, we have

(i) M(t11a11b12 + t11c12d22) = M(t11a11b12) + M(t11c12d22);

(ii) M*  - 1(t11a11b12 + t11c12d22) = M*  - 1(t11a11b12) + M*  - 1(t11c12d22).

We only prove (i). Using Lemma [\ref=lemma1112] and Lemma [\ref=lemma2212], we compute

[formula]

Both M and M*  - 1 are additive on T12.

Let a12 and b12 be in T12. We pick c∈T such that M(c) = M(a12) + M(b12).

For arbitrary t11,s11∈T11, by Lemma [\ref=add], we have

[formula]

this implies that t11cs11 = 0, and so c11 = 0.

Similarly, we can get c22 = 0.

We now show that c12 = a12 + b12. For any t11,r11∈T11 and s22∈T22, by Lemma [\ref=add] and Lemma [\ref=lemma111112], we obtain

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Equivalently,

[formula]

Then we get c12 = a12 + b12.

With the similar argument, one can see that M*  - 1 is also additive on T12.

Both M and M*  - 1 are additive on T11.

We only show the additivity of M on T11. Suppose that a11 and b11 are two elements of T11. Let c∈T be chosen satisfying M(c) = M(a11) + M(b11). Now for any t22,s22∈T22, we have

[formula]

Consequently, t22cs22 = 0, i.e., t22c22s22 = 0, and so c22 = 0.

Similarly, we can infer that c12 = 0.

To complete the proof, we need to show that c11 = a11 + b11. For each t11∈T11 and s12∈T12, we consider

[formula]

Note that in the last equality we apply Lemma [\ref=lemma12]. It follows that

[formula]

This leads to c11 = a11 + b11, as desired.

M and M*  - 1 are additive on T22.

Suppose that a22 and b22 are in T22. We choose c∈T such that M(c) = M(a22) + M(b22). For any t12∈T12 and s22∈T22, using Lemma [\ref=lemma12], we have

[formula]

Accordingly, t12cs22 = t12(a22 + b22)s22, which yields that c22 = a22 + b22.

With the similar argument, we can verify that c11 = c12 = 0.

The additivity of M*  - 1 on T22 follows easily.

For any a11∈T11, b12∈T12, and c22∈T22, the following are true.

(i) M(a11 + b12 + c22) = M(a11) + M(b12) + M(c22);

(ii) M*  - 1(a11 + b12 + c22) = M*  - 1(a11) + M*  - 1(b12) + M*  - 1(c22).

We only prove (i). Let d∈T be an element satisfying M(d) = M(a11) + M(b12) + M(c22). For any s,t∈T, using Lemma [\ref=add] twice, we can arrive at

[formula]

Letting s = s11 and t = t11 in the above equality, we get d11 = a11.

In the same fashion for s = s22 and t = t22 in equality ([\ref=22]), we can infer that d22 = c22.

Finally, considering s = s11 and t = t22 in equality ([\ref=22]), we see that d12 = b12. Thus, d = a11 + b12 + c22, which completes the proof.

We now prove our main result.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem] We first show the additivity of M. Let a = a11 + a12 + a22 and b = b11 + b12 + b22 be two arbitrary elements of T. We have

[formula]

That is, M is additive.

We now turn to prove that M* is additive. For any [formula], there exist c = c11 + c12 + c22 and d = d11 + d12 + d22 in R such that c = M*(x + y) and d = M*(x) + M*(y).

For arbitrary s,t∈T, by the additivity of M, we compute

[formula]

which implies that sct = sdt. Furthermore, we get c = d, i.e., M*(x + y) = M*(x) + M*(y).

In particular, if both A and B are unital algebras, we have

Let [formula] be an arbitrary ring. Let A and B be two unital algebras over a commutative ring R, M a faithful (A,B)-bimodule, and T be the triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B). Suppose that (M,M*) is an elementary map on [formula], and both M and M* are surjective. Then both M and M* are additive.

Recall that a subalgebra of B(X) is called a standard operator if it contains all finite rank operators, where B(X) is the algebra of all bounded linear operator on a Banach space X.

We complete this note by considering elementary maps on triangular algebras provided A and B are standard operator algebras.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary ring. Let A and B be two standard operator algebras over a Banach space X, M a faithful (A,B)-bimodule, and T be the triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B). Suppose that (M,M*) is an elementary map on [formula], and both M and M* are surjective. Then both M and M* are additive.
