On the dimension of subspaces with bounded Schmidt rank

Introduction. Entanglement is at the heart of quantum information theory, and this property of quantum systems is ultimately responsible for new information tasks such as teleportation [\cite=teleport], quantum key agreement [\cite=qkd1] [\cite=qkd2] or quantum computational speedup [\cite=Shor]. Consequently, a theory of measuring and comparing the entanglement content of quantum states has emerged [\cite=entanglement-survey], which attempts to classify states according to their non-classical capabilities. It is, however, remarkable how large a number of entanglement measures have been put forward [\cite=entanglement-survey] [\cite=Christandl], indicating that the structure of entanglement is not one that can be captured by a single number. One particular measure is the Schmidt rank of a pure bipartite state [formula], i.e. the number of non-zero coefficients λi in the -- essentially unique -- Schmidt form: This measure has even been extended to mixed states, as the maximum Schmidt rank in an optimal pure state decomposition [\cite=TerhalHorodecki], but the convex hull construction could also be considered. For pure states, the Schmidt rank is indeed the unique invariant under the class of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC).

Here we ask, and answer completely, the question: what is the maximum dimension of a subspace S in a dA  ×  dB bipartite system such that every state in S has Schmidt rank at least r? This is trivial for r = 1, so we can assume r  ≥  2; also, the Schmidt rank can be at most min {dA,dB}, which we will assume without loss of generality to be dA.

There are two extreme cases. The first, r = 2 (i.e. a subspace that contains no product state), is addressed in [\cite=Parthasarathy]; the answer is (dA - 1)(dB - 1). The other, r  =  dA  =  dB = :d, has an elementary solution: the answer is 1 (take any one-dimensional subspace spanned by a vector of maximum Schmidt rank d). To show this, consider any two-dimensional subspace spanned by unit vectors [formula]. We want to show that at least one superposition [formula] has Schmidt rank less than d. The crucial observation is that we can arrange the coefficients of a state vector [formula] in the computational basis [formula], into a d  ×  d matrix M(φ), and that the Schmidt rank of the state vector equals the linear rank of the associated matrix. In other words, the statement that [formula] has Schmidt rank less than r is captured by the vanishing of the determinant det M(φx). But the latter is a non-constant polynomial in x of degree d. Hence, it must have a root in the complex field, and the corresponding [formula] has Schmidt rank r - 1 or less.

It turns out that the generalisation to arbitrary r rests on the same matrix representation, and the characterisation of Schmidt rank via vanishing of certain determinants again plays a crucial role. It involves, however, much deeper algebraic geometry machinery, extending the above use of the fundamental theorem of algebra.

Notation and Terminology. We will denote the Schmidt rank of a bipartite pure state [formula] (nonzero, but not necessarily normalised) by [formula]. We say that a subspace S of the bipartite space in question has Schmidt rank ≥  r if all its nonzero vectors have Schmidt rank ≥  r (analogously for ≤  r and = r). If M is a matrix, R is a set of indices for rows of M, and C is a set of indices for columns, then M{R,C} denotes the submatrix formed by deleting all rows and columns other than those in R and C.

The projective space of dimension d is denoted by [formula]. This is the space of lines (one-dimensional subspaces) of [formula]; i.e. it is obtained from the nonzero elements of [formula] by identifying collinear vectors. If a subset [formula] is a union of lines, this identification associates to it a natural projectification of S, denoted by [formula]; see e.g. [\cite=Griffiths] [\cite=Harris] [\cite=Shafarevich] [\cite=CoxLittleOShea] for this and related notions from algebraic geometry.

For a state vector [formula], with fixed local bases of the two Hilbert spaces, such that [formula], define the dA  ×  dB matrix [formula]. This identifies [formula] with the space [formula] of dA  ×  dB matrices.

Bounding the dimension of highly entangled subspaces. We first state some preparatory lemmas relating bipartite states to matrices, whose proofs are widely known and do not warrant repetition here.

The set of (unnormalised) states in [formula] with Schmidt rank r is isomorphic to the set of dA  ×  dB complex matrices with rank r.

Obvious from the standard proof of the Schmidt decomposition via the singular value decomposition.

A matrix M has [formula] iff all its order-r minors (the determinants of r  ×  r submatrices) are zero.

See [\cite=Horn+Johnson].

This means that a geometric characterisation of subspaces of Schmidt rank ≥  r is to say that the linear space M(S) of associated matrices doesn't intersect the set of common zeros of all order-r minors (except in the zero vector). Such common zeroes of sets of multivariate polynomials are called (algebraic) varieties, and the one in question has been studied in the mathematical literature .

The affine determinantal variety Dr(dA,dB) over the (algebraically closed) field [formula] in the space [formula] is the variety defined by the vanishing of all order-r minors of a dA  ×  dB matrix, whose elements are considered as independent variables in [formula].

(Of course, in quantum theory we are mostly interested in the case [formula].)

The basic idea is now essentially parameter counting: if the dimension of S plus that of the variety Dr(dA,dB) is larger than dAdB, then the polynomial equations defining the order-r minors have roots in M(S). To make this heuristic rigorous, we need to go to the corresponding projective spaces: since the polynomials defined by the minors of a matrix are homogeneous, a determinantal variety can also be thought of as a projective variety [formula] in the space [formula]. The same is true for the subspace S, so it also has a projectification [formula].

The dimension of an affine determinantal variety is given by dim Dr(dA,dB)  =  dAdB  -  (dA  -  r  +  1)(dB  -  r  +  1).

See e.g. [\cite=Harris].

The corresponding projective determinantal variety has, of course, dimension one less: [formula]. Likewise, the dimension of [formula] is dim S - 1.

Now, for projective varieties, the parameter counting argument always holds:

If V and W are projective varieties in [formula] such that dim V  +   dim W  ≥  d, then [formula].

See e.g. [\cite=Shafarevich] or [\cite=Harris].

For any subspace [formula] of dimension dim S  >  (dA - r + 1)(dB - r + 1), there exists at least one state in the subspace with Schmidt rank strictly less than r.

The set of all (unnormalised) states in the bipartite space [formula] forms a projective space [formula] over the complex field. From , the subset of those states with Schmidt rank less than r then forms a projective determinantal variety [formula] in that space. The subspace S corresponds to the projective variety [formula] (a projective linear subspace), which has dimension [formula] by assumption.

Making use of , we have Thus by , [formula] and [formula] have a non-empty intersection, i.e.  the subspace S contains at least one state with Schmidt rank less than r.

Construction of highly entangled subspaces. We will now give an explicit construction of a subspace with bounded Schmidt rank that saturates the bound of , based on totally non-singular matrices. (Note that we can not simply take the complement of [formula] in [formula], since it is by no means clear that this is a projective linear variety, i.e. a subspace.)

A matrix is said to be totally non-singular if all of its minors are non-zero.

There exist totally non-singular matrices of any dimension.

The n  ×  n Vandermonde matrix generated by [formula] is totally positive (i.e. all its minors are strictly positive, see [\cite=Fallat]), therefore is also totally non-singular. Alternatively, it is also clear that a generic complex matrix will be totally non-singular, as the vanishing of a minor defines a set of matrices of measure 0.

Let M be an m  ×  m totally non-singular matrix, with m  ≥  n. Let v be any linear combination of n of the columns of M. Then v contains at most n - 1 zero elements.

Assume for contradiction that there exists a linear combination of n columns of M containing n or more zero elements. Let R be the set of indices of n of those zero elements and C be the set of indices of the n columns. Since there is a linear combination of the columns of M such that the elements indexed by R are all zero, the columns of the submatrix M{R,C} are linearly dependent, thus the minor det M{R,C} is zero and we have a contradiction.

The construction of the subspace is based on the sets of vectors introduced in .

Every bipartite system [formula] has a subspace S of Schmidt rank ≥  r, and of dimension dim S  =  (dA - r + 1)(dB - r + 1).

Since the bipartite states with Schmidt rank bounded by r are isomorphic to dA  ×  dB matrices whose rank is at least r (), and a matrix has rank greater than or equal to r iff at least one of its order-r minors is non-zero (), it is sufficient to construct a set of linearly independent matrices S of cardinality [formula] such that any linear combination of them has at least one non-zero order-r minor, since these then define a basis for a subspace with the desired properties.

Label the diagonals of a dA  ×  dB matrix by integers k, with k increasing from lower-left to upper-right, and denote the length of the [formula] diagonal by [formula]. From , there exist sets of [formula] linearly independent vectors of length [formula] such that any linear combination of them has at most t - 1 zero elements, or conversely, has at least [formula] non-zero elements.

For each diagonal with length [formula], construct a set of linearly independent matrices Sk of cardinality [formula] by putting these vectors down the [formula] diagonal. By construction, any linear combination of these will have at least r non-zero elements down that diagonal. Since the determinant of the r  ×  r submatrix with these r non-zero elements down its main diagonal is clearly non-zero, any linear combination of matrices in Sk has at least one non-zero order-r minor, thus has rank at least r.

Now define the set [formula]. Since matrices from different Sk have elements down different diagonals, the matrices in S are linearly independent. It remains to show that any linear combination of matrices from different Sk still has rank at least r. Let M be a matrix given by some linear combination of matrices in S, and let κ be the maximum k for which the linear combination includes matrices from Sk. It is still true that the [formula] diagonal of M must contain at least r non-zero elements. As κ labels the top-rightmost diagonal of M that contains any non-zero elements, the r  ×  r submatrix of M with those r non-zero elements down its main diagonal is lower-triangular, so has non-zero determinant. Thus M has at least one non-zero order-r minor, so has rank at least r.

Assume for convenience that dB  ≥  dA. To determine the cardinality of S, i.e. the dimension of the subspace, note that a dA  ×  dB matrix has 1 + dB - dA diagonals of length dA, and 2 diagonals of each length less than dA. Then the cardinality of S is given by

[formula]

which matches the claimed dimension of the subspace.

Subspaces with bounded Schmidt rank. Putting together , we obtain our main result:

The maximum dimension of a subspace [formula] of Schmidt rank ≥  r is given by (dA - r + 1)(dB - r + 1). [formula]

One could instead ask for the converse: subspaces of Schmidt rank ≤  r. Note that geometrically this corresponds to a linear subspace lying within the determinantal variety Dr + 1(dA,dB). There is a simple construction, [formula], for any subspace [formula] of dimension r, which achieves dim S  =  rdB. This is clearly tight if r = 1 or r = dA. In fact, one can show that this construction is optimal in general, which is immediate from the following theorem due to Flanders [\cite=Flanders]:

Let S be a subspace of the space of dA  ×  dB matrices, where dA  ≤  dB. Let r be the maximum rank of any element of S. Then dim S  ≤  rdB. [formula]

Another interesting variant is to ask what are the subspaces which have Schmidt rank exactly r. For example, our construction above yields subspaces of dimension dB - dA + 1 in [formula] of Schmidt rank equal to dA. A different example is given by the three-dimensional completely antisymmetric subspace of [formula], which has Schmidt rank equal to 2. This question has been the subject of a remarkably long-running study in the linear algebra literature and, as far as we are aware, the general case remains unsolved. The best existing results are summarised in the following theorem, which can be found in [\cite=westwick]:

Let S be the largest subspace of the space of dA  ×  dB matrices, with dB  ≥  dA, such that the rank of every non-zero element of S is r. Then in general, Furthermore, if dB  -  r  +  1 does not divide (dA - 1)! / (r - 1)!, then dim S  =  dB - r + 1. If dA = r + 1,dB = 2r - 1, then dim S  =  r  +  1. [formula]

For sufficiently large dB, it is of course impossible for dB - r + 1 to divide (dA - 1)! / (r - 1)!, so the result for that case applies to all sufficiently high-dimensional spaces. It appears to be impossible to obtain this result via general dimensional arguments similar to those used in this paper, which only reproduce the general upper bound, dim S  ≤  (dB - r + 1) + (dA - r).

Discussion: applications and open questions. We have determined the exact maximum dimension of subspaces of Schmidt rank ≥  r in any bipartite quantum system. The upper bound on the dimension is a generalisation of Parthasarathy's argument [\cite=Parthasarathy] for a subspace avoiding the manifold of product states, to the avoiding of a determinantal variety. Our constructive lower bound seems to differ from Parthasarathy's (in the case r = 2), which is based on unextendible product vector systems.

Comparing these results, using the Schmidt measure, with [\cite=random_subspace], where the entropy measure of entanglement is used, we have much tighter control on the entanglement in subspaces. For example, in the cited paper, the random subspaces that are constructed are necessarily highly entangled, simply because that is the generic behaviour of random states. In contrast, here we find the largest subspaces of bounded Schmidt rank over the whole range of the entanglement measure, including values far away from typical. This is most clearly demonstrated by considering subspaces with Schmidt rank within a constant fraction of the maximum: r  ≥  kdA. For k  ≥  2- dA / (dB ln 2), using the results of [\cite=random_subspace] gives nothing better than the trivial one-dimensional subspace, yet the exact result is asymptotically of order (1 - k)2dAdB, i.e. within a constant fraction of the entire space!

Our results can be used, in the spirit of [\cite=random_subspace], to construct highly mixed states of very large Schmidt measure [\cite=TerhalHorodecki]: let ρ be the normalised projector onto a maximum dimensional subspace S of Schmidt rank ≥  r. Then, since every pure state decomposition of ρ can only consist of state vectors from S, any entanglement measure built from the Schmidt ranks of the constituent pure states has to be at least r. For example, in arbitrarily large d  ×  d-systems, we thus find for any p states of rank ≥  p2d2 (i.e. entropy 2 log d  +  2 log p) and Schmidt measure ≥  (1 - p)d. The ideas and results described in this paper also have applications to the study of degradable quantum channels [\cite=toby].

The present paper raises a number of questions: a first is about multiparty generalisations, e.g. looking at subspaces with constraints on the Schmidt rank across all bipartite cuts. The case of completely entangled subspaces was solved in [\cite=Parthasarathy]. Note that, were random subspaces to saturate the bound in , a random subspace saturating the tightest of the bipartite constraints would automatically satisfy all the other constraints. The multipartite case would therefore reduce to the bipartite case. However, this would contradict the known result for completely entangled subspaces, once again underlining the fact that progress in this type of problem requires going beyond the typical case.

We could also attempt to make statements about more operationally motivated entanglement measures, especially those based on von Neumann or Rényi entropies, as for example in [\cite=random_subspace]. However, the algebraic techniques used here do not seem to give any insight into these problems.
