On Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian spheres in non-Einstein Kähler surfaces

Introduction

Minimal Lagrangian submanifolds of Kähler manifolds acquired a great importance since 1982, when Harvey and Lawson in [\cite=HL] proved that the orientable minimal Lagrangian submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau manifold are exactly the special Lagrangian submanifolds, i.e. the calibrated submanifolds for the special Lagrangian calibration that a Calabi-Yau manifold carries. In particular, they are volume minimizing in their integer homology classes.

For Lagrangian submanifolds, it is also natural to study those which are critical for the volume under variations that keep the property to be Lagrangian. This kind of submanifolds are called Lagrangian stationary and Schoen and Wolfson [\cite=SW] proved that, when the ambient Kähler manifold is Einstein, they are exactly the minimal Lagrangian ones. Among these variations, the Hamiltonian variations are particulary important and Oh was who studied in [\cite=O] Lagrangian submanifolds of a Kähler manifold which are critical for the volume under Hamiltonian deformations. These submanifolds are called Hamiltonian stationary (or also Hamiltonian minimal) and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation that characterizes them is

[formula]

where d* is the adjoint operator of the exterior differential and αH is the 1-form on the submanifold defined by [formula], ω being the Kähler 2-form of the ambient space and H the mean curvature vector of the submanifold. It is clear that this condition is equivalent to [formula], where J is the complex structure of the ambient space and div stands for the divergence operator on the submanifold.

It is a very well known fact that if Σ is a Lagrangian submanifold of a Kähler manifold, then

[formula]

where Ric denotes the Ricci 2-form on the ambient space. Hence if the ambient space is Kähler-Einstein, then αH is a closed 1-form. In this case, using ([\ref=EL]) it is clear that if Σ is Hamiltonian stationary then αH is a harmonic 1-form on Σ. This fact implies that if Σ is, in addition, compact and its first Betti number vanishes, then H = 0, and the submanifold is minimal. Thus, in particular, Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian spheres in Kähler-Einstein manifolds are necessarily minimal.

Most of the literature about Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian surfaces is centered in complex space forms. Hence when the surface is compact, the study of the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori plays a relevant role (for example, see [\cite=CU1], [\cite=HR1] or [\cite=HR2]).

In this paper we are interested in studying non minimal Hamiltonian stationary spheres of Kähler manifolds. As the ambient space can not be Einstein, for the sake of simplicity we have considered (as Kähler target manifolds) the products of two Riemann surfaces Σ1  ×  Σ2 endowed with metrics of constant Gauss curvatures c1 and c2 with [formula], because Σ1  ×  Σ2 is Einstein if and only if c1 = c2. It is clear that we can assume without restriction that c1 > c2.

Our main contribution in this paper is the following Existence and Uniqueness Theorem.

Let Φ:Σ  →  Σ1  ×  Σ2 be a Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion of a sphere Σ in the product of two complete orientable Riemannian surfaces Σi, i = 1,2, of constant Gauss curvatures ci, i = 1,2, with c1  >  c2. Then

c1,c2 > 0 and hence Σ1  ×  Σ2 is isometric to the product of two spheres [formula].

Φ is congruent to the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion [formula], where

[formula]

[formula] is the unit sphere and, in general, the sphere [formula] is given by [formula].

It is an easy exercise to check that Φ0 is a Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian embedding except at the poles of [formula] where it has a double point. Hence [formula], which is given by

[formula]

is a surface of [formula] with a singularity at [formula].

In the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=Th1], we have not assumed that the submanifold was non minimal, because in these ambient spaces there are no minimal Lagrangian spheres (see Proposition [\ref=Prop2]).

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Th1] involves arguments of different nature which are developed in section 3. In section 3.1 we show that the property of the surface to be Hamiltonian stationary, joint with the product structure of the ambient space, allow to define a holomorphic Hopf differential (see ([\ref=Theta])) on the surface. A similar construction was made by Abresh and Rosenberg [\cite=AR] for constant mean curvature surfaces in [formula] and [formula], where [formula] is the hyperbolic plane. As the surface is a sphere, this Hopf differential vanishes, and this allows us to construct another holomorphic Hopf differential (see ([\ref=Xi])), which can be defined only for Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian spheres.

The vanishing of the two Hopf differentials provide, in section 3.2, important geometric properties of our surface. First we prove that the length of the mean curvature |H| is locally the product of a smooth positive function and the modulus of a holomorphic function. Hence we have that

[formula]

where N(|H|) is the sum of the orders of the zeroes of |H| and Δ is the Laplacian operator. Second we show how this formula becomes in the fundamental equality

[formula]

This fact, joint with the Bochner formula for the tangent vector field JH, allows to prove that c1 and c2 must be positive and so [formula].

Finally, in section 3.3, if we consider [formula] and H̃ is the mean curvature of Σ into [formula], then the equality ([\ref=fla]) give us the value of its Willmore functional:

[formula]

As for topological reasons our surface can not be embedded (see Corollary 1), a result of Li and Yau [\cite=LY] yields that our surface is not only a Willmore surface in [formula] but also a minimizer for the Willmore functional. Moreover, our surface is the compactification by an inversion of [formula] of a complete minimal surface of [formula] with two planar embedded ends and total curvature - 4π, which turns out to lie in a 4-dimensional affine subspace of [formula]. Using the classification obtained by Hoffman and Osserman in [\cite=HO], we obtain a 1-parameter family of Lagrangian immersions Φt,  t  ≥  0 (see ([\ref=Phis]) for their explicit definition) of a sphere into [formula] which satisfy ([\ref=fla]). Next it is easy to check that the immersion Φ0 is the only Hamiltonian stationary in this family. We remark that precisely Φ0 is the compactification of the Lagrangian catenoid defined in [\cite=HL].

The above reasoning also proves the following result.

Let [formula] be a Lagrangian immersion of a sphere Σ in the product of two spheres of Gauss curvatures c1  >  c2. Then

[formula]

and the equality holds if and only if Φ is congruent to some Φt,  t  ≥  0 (see ([\ref=Phis]) for their definition).

The Lagrangian variation Φt of Φ0 is Hamiltonian, and if A(t) is the area of the induced metric on Σ by Φt, then A(t) has a global maximum at t = 0 and lim t  →    ∞A(t) = 0. Therefore Φ0 is unstable and there are no minimizers for the area in its Hamiltonian isotopy class.

Preliminaries

Let (Σ1,g1) and (Σ2,g2) be two Riemannian orientable surfaces with constant Gauss curvatures c1 and c2. We denote by ω1 and ω2 their Kähler 2-forms and by J1 and J2 their complex structures as Riemann surfaces.

Consider the product Kähler surface Σ1  ×  Σ2, endowed with the product metric 〈,〉 = g1  ×  g2 and the complex structure J = (J1,J2). Its Kähler 2-form is ω  =  π*1ω1  +  π*2ω2, where πi are the projections of Σ1  ×  Σ2 onto Σi, i = 1,2.

Along the paper we will use the product structure on Σ1  ×  Σ2, which is the (1,1)-tensor P defined by

[formula]

We remark that P is parallel, i.e. [formula], where [formula] is the Levi-Civita connection of the product metric 〈,〉. In addition, P is an 〈,〉-isometry and verifies P2  =  Id and [formula].

Let Φ = (φ,ψ):Σ  →  Σ1  ×  Σ2 be a Lagrangian immersion of a surface Σ, i.e. an immersion satisfying Φ*ω = 0. In this case, this condition means that φ*ω1  +  ψ*ω2 = 0 or, equivalently:

[formula]

for any p∈Σ and v,w∈TpΣ. If Σ is an oriented surface and ωΣ is the area 2-form of its induced metric, the Jacobians of φ and ψ are given by

[formula]

and hence [formula]. We will call the function

[formula]

the associated Jacobian of the oriented Lagrangian surface Σ. It is easy to check that the restriction to Σ of the Ricci 2-form on Σ1  ×  Σ2 is given by [formula] and then ([\ref=Ric]) becomes in

[formula]

In the compact case, integrating ([\ref=d_Maslov]) and using the Stokes theorem and ([\ref=Jacs]) and ([\ref=defC]), we get the following result.

If Φ = (φ,ψ):Σ  →  Σ1  ×  Σ2 is a Lagrangian immersion of a compact oriented surface Σ in the product Σ1  ×  Σ2 with Σ1 and Σ2 compact and [formula], then the degrees of φ and ψ satisfy

[formula]

If [formula] this proposition offers an interesting consequence.

If [formula] is a Lagrangian embedding of a compact orientable surface Σ, with c1  ≠  c2, then Σ must be a torus.

This result is not true when c1 = c2 since the graph of the antipodal map is a Lagrangian sphere embedded in [formula] (see [\cite=CU2]).

Let γ be the genus of Σ. Following the same reasoning that in the proof of Proposition 3 in [\cite=CU2] (that is, computing the self-intersection number of Φ), as Φ is an embedding, we can prove that the degrees of φ and ψ satisfy

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=Prop1] says that γ = 1 and so Σ is a torus.

In the general case (Σ not necessarily compact), we can prove the following result.

Let Φ:Σ  →  Σ1  ×  Σ2 be a Lagrangian immersion of an orientable surface Σ in the product Σ1  ×  Σ2 with [formula]. If Φ is minimal (or, more generally, Φ has parallel mean curvature vector), then Φ must be a product of two curves in Σ1 and Σ2 with constant curvatures. In particular, there are no minimal Lagrangian spheres in Σ1  ×  Σ2 with [formula].

As usual, Φ = (φ,ψ). Using again ([\ref=d_Maslov]), the assumption about the mean curvature joint with [formula] say that the associated Jacobian [formula]. But it is not difficult to check (see Lemma 2.1 in [\cite=CU2]) that if {e1,e2} is an oriented orthonormal basis of TpΣ, then

[formula]

which implies that the ranks of dφ and dψ at any point of Σ are always positive. Hence, if [formula], i.e. the Jacobians of φ and ψ vanish, then the ranks of dφ and dψ at any point must be necessarily 1 and so both functions φ and ψ define curves in Σi, i = 1,2, respectively. Now it is an exercise to check that the product of two curves has parallel mean curvature vector if and only if both curves have constant curvature.

Finally, if [formula] denotes the curvature operator of Σ1  ×  Σ2, it is easy to prove that (e1,e2,e2,e1) = (c1 + c2)C2, where {e1,e2} is an orthonormal frame on TΣ. Thus the Gauss equation of Φ can be written as

[formula]

where K is the Gauss curvature of Σ, H the mean curvature of Φ and σ the second fundamental form of Φ.

Proof of the Main Theorem

Let Φ:Σ  →  Σ1  ×  Σ2 be a Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion of a sphere Σ in the product of two orientable Riemannian complete surfaces Σi of constant Gauss curvatures ci, i = 1,2, with c1  >  c2.

We split the proof of the Theorem [\ref=Th1] in three parts.

Hopf differentials

We consider a local complex coordinate z = x + iy on Σ and let [formula] and [formula] the Cauchy-Riemann operators. Letting g and [formula] also denote the complex extension of the induced metric and its Levi-Civita connection, we have that

[formula]

where g = e2u|dz2|.

We will also use [formula] to denote the Levi-Civita connection on the pulled-back bundle Φ- 1T(Σ1  ×  Σ2) and let

[formula]

be the corrresponding covariant derivatives acting on Φ- 1T(Σ1  ×  Σ2).

In the sequel we will frequently identify the fibres of Φ- 1T(Σ1  ×  Σ2) and T(Σ1  ×  Σ2) in order to write

[formula]

Hence, we have that

[formula]

From ([\ref=defC]) it is easy to get that the associated Jacobian C can be written as

[formula]

Along the proof it will be useful the following formula deduced from ([\ref=1=bo]), ([\ref=conformal]) and ([\ref=C]):

[formula]

The starting point in the proof is to use ([\ref=d_Maslov]) and ([\ref=C]) to get the fundamental relation:

[formula]

Hence Φ is Hamiltonian stationary if and only if

[formula]

We use ([\ref=h_z]) and the product structure on Σ1  ×  Σ2 to define a Hopf quadratic differential on Σ. Since H = 2e- 2uδΦ, using the properties of the product structure P, we deduce that

[formula]

We observe that if ξ is a normal vector field, it is easy to check that 〈ξ,PδΦ〉 = 2i  C〈ξ,JδΦ〉 using ([\ref=C]) and ([\ref=Frenet3]). So 〈H,PδΦ〉 = 2i  C〈H,JδΦ〉. Putting this in the above equation leads to

[formula]

Now ([\ref=h_z]) and ([\ref=G_zbarra]) yield to [formula]. We have proved that the Hopf quadratic differential

[formula]

is holomorphic.

As the surface Σ is a sphere, [formula] and so we get that

[formula]

It is easy to check that

[formula]

and, as a consequence, taking modules in ([\ref=ya_esfera]) and using ([\ref=|G|y|h|]), we obtain

[formula]

Thus the zeroes of H are exactly the points of Σ where C =   ±  1 / 2.

Next we explode the equation ([\ref=ya_esfera]) derivating it with respect to z. To do that, we use again 〈ξ,PδΦ〉 = 2i  C〈ξ,JδΦ〉, for any normal vector field ξ, and the properties of P. This fact gives that

[formula]

that joint with ([\ref=ya_esfera]) produces

[formula]

Now we define a new Hopf quadratic differential outside the zeroes of H (that is, outside the zeroes of 〈H,JδΦ〉) given by

[formula]

In order to prove that Ξ is meromorphic, we use the Codazzi equation of the immersion Φ and ([\ref=C]) to get

[formula]

where we have used that 4  (Φ,δΦ,δΦ, JδΦ) =  - i(c1 + c2)e2uC〈δΦ,PδΦ〉. Using ([\ref=G_z]) and ([\ref=f_zbarra]) we arrive at

[formula]

It is easy to check now, using ([\ref=G_zbarra]) and ([\ref=+]), that the quadratic differential Ξ is meromorphic. But if p is a zero of 〈H,JδΦ〉, ([\ref=+]) says that p is also a zero of 〈δδΦ,JδΦ〉 since at this point C2(p) = 1 / 4 from ([\ref=|H|oC]). In this way, Ξ has no poles and so it is a holomorphic differential. Hence, as Σ is a sphere, necessarily [formula] and using ([\ref=ya_esfera]) we obtain that

[formula]

Finally, taking modules in ([\ref=esfera2]) and using ([\ref=EqG]) and ([\ref=|G|y|h|]) we obtain the following formula for the Gauss curvature of our surface:

[formula]

Geometric meaning of the vanishing of the Hopf differentials

We are going to study the non trivial function |H|. To do that, we define the complex function h = 2e- u〈H,JΦ〉, which satisfies |H| = |h|. But using ([\ref=ya_esfera]) and ([\ref=esfera2]), we obtain that

[formula]

which means that h is locally the product of a positive function and a holomorphic function. In fact, if t is a local solution of the equation

[formula]

then h = et(e- th), where et is positive and from the above equations e- th is a holomorphic function.

Since Φ can not be minimal (see Proposition [\ref=Prop2]), using Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=EGT], we have that

[formula]

where N(|H|) is the sum of all orders for all zeroes of |H|. From ([\ref=|H|oC]), we get that

[formula]

Hence, our next purpose is the computation of [formula] and ΔC. To do that, using ([\ref=Frenet3]) and ([\ref=C]) again, we deduce

[formula]

When we put in ([\ref=C_z]) the information of ([\ref=ya_esfera]) and ([\ref=esfera2]) we arrive at

[formula]

Finally, using that [formula] and ([\ref=|G|y|h|]), we conclude that the modulus of the gradient of C is given by

[formula]

As ΔC  =  4e- 2uCz, we derivate ([\ref=C_z]) with respect to [formula]. After a long straightforward computation, using ([\ref=h_z]) and ([\ref=|G|y|h|]) joint to ([\ref=ya_esfera]) and ([\ref=esfera2]), we deduce the formula for the Laplacian of C, which is given by

[formula]

Now we put ([\ref=gradC]) and ([\ref=deltaC]) in ([\ref=lalog1]) to reach

[formula]

Finally, using ([\ref=|H|oC]) and ([\ref=Ko|H|]) in ([\ref=lalog2]) we get that

[formula]

Integrating this equation, using ([\ref=EGT]) and the Gauss-Bonnet and Poincar�-Hopf theorems, we conclude that

[formula]

This important geometric property of our Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian sphere is the key to prove the main result. In fact, we finish this section by proving that c1 and c2 must be positive and hence [formula].

From ([\ref=|H|oC]), we get that [formula] and then ([\ref=equalityin]) says that

[formula]

which implies that c1 > 0.

We now prove that not only c1 > 0 but also c2 > 0. The reasoning starts from the Bochner formula for the tangent vector field JH:

[formula]

Using that [formula] and the Lagrangian character of our surface, the above formula becomes in

[formula]

Once more, the information about our immersion given in the equations ([\ref=h_z]), ([\ref=ya_esfera]), ([\ref=|H|oC]) and ([\ref=+]) allow us to express [formula] in terms of |H|2 and the associated Jacobian C. After a non difficult long computation we arrive at

[formula]

This formula joint with ([\ref=Ko|H|]) becomes the integrand of ([\ref=Bochner]) in the following polynomial in |H|2:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Suppose now that c2  ≤  0. It is clear this implies a  ≥  0 and that the discriminant of the second degree polynomial of ([\ref=poly]) satisfies

[formula]

Hence we can deduce from ([\ref=poly]) that [formula]. But then ([\ref=Bochner]) gives that [formula] and therefore

[formula]

too. We have arrived at [formula] and this is impossible according to the proof of Proposition [\ref=Prop2]. In this way we have proved that c2 must also be positive.

As a final conclusion of this section, the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian sphere Σ lies in [formula] and satisfies

[formula]

Lagrangian spheres in [formula] and the Willmore functional

In this section we are going to prove Theorem [\ref=Th2] and conclude the proof of the main Theorem [\ref=Th1].

We consider [formula] and let H̃ be the mean curvature vector of [formula]. Using ([\ref=1=bo]) we get that

[formula]

and hence [formula]. Thus the Willmore functional W(Φ) of Σ in [formula] is given by

[formula]

We also need a result of Simon and Li-Yau, that we recall now.

([\cite=S],[\cite=LY]) Let [formula] be an immersion of a compact surface Σ with mean curvature vector H̃ and maximum multiplicity μ. Then

[formula]

and the equality holds if and only if H̃ is given on [formula] by [formula], where [formula] stands for normal component and a = Φ(pi), for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  μ. This condition about the mean curvature H̃ means that [formula] is a complete minimal immersion with μ planar and embedded ends and finite total curvature.

From Corollary 1, our Lagrangian sphere Σ cannot be embedded and so we have that μ  ≥  2. Thus applying Theorem [\ref=ThA] and using ([\ref=Willmore]) we get the inequality of Theorem [\ref=Th2].

Next we analyze the case of equality which, in particular, happens to the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian sphere Σ of Theorem 1 according to ([\ref=equalityin]).

As the equality holds, using Theorem [\ref=ThA] we have that μ  =  2, [formula], [formula], and the mean curvature vector H̃ is given by [formula], that joint with ([\ref=Htilde]) says

[formula]

This property allows to prove that Φ lies in a affine hyperplane of [formula]. In fact, if â = ( - a1,a2), we have that

[formula]

because ( - φ,ψ) is a normal vector field to [formula] in [formula].

Using again Theorem [\ref=ThA], we obtain a complete minimal immersion

[formula]

with two planar ends and total curvature - 4π. It is clear that Φ can be recuperated from [formula] by

[formula]

Let us analyze in depth the immersion [formula]. First, equation ([\ref=last]) satisfying Φ becomes in

[formula]

On the other hand, using that |Φ - a|2 = 2(1 / c - 〈Φ,a〉), it is clear that

[formula]

Hence from ([\ref=hatPhi2]) and ([\ref=caeR5]) we have deduced that [formula] lies in a 4-dimensional affine subspace of [formula]. But then [formula] is one of the embedded complex surfaces of [formula] with finite total curvature - 4π given in Proposition 6.6 in [\cite=HO] which, up to congruences and dilations, can be described by the one-parameter family of Lawlor's minimal cylinders ([\cite=L]),

[formula]

We now make use of the parametrization [formula] of the cylinders Ct obtained in [\cite=CCh], which are given by

[formula]

We can choose without restriction [formula], i = 1,2. From ([\ref=hatPhi2]) and ([\ref=caeR5]) we have that [formula] is congruent to some t of the one-parameter family of minimal embeddings

[formula]

Using then ([\ref=invertida]), ([\ref=FG]) and ([\ref=hatPhi1]) joint to the conformal map

[formula]

after a long straightforward computation, we conclude that our original Lagrangian immersion Φ is congruent to some Φt of the one-parameter family of Lagrangian immersions, [formula], [formula], given by

[formula]

where st  =   sinh t and ct  =   cosh t.

It is now an exercise to check that [formula], satisfy the equality ([\ref=equalityin]), are embeddings except at the poles of [formula] where they have a double point and Φ- t is congruent to Φt for each t > 0. This finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=Th2].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Th1] concludes when we compute the divergence of the tangent vector field JHt for each immersion Φt, obtaining

[formula]

that proves that the immersion Φ0 given in ([\ref=Phi_0]) is the only Hamiltonian stationary one in the family.

Stability properties of the sphere S0

In this section we are interested in stability properties of the Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion Φ0. We first note that the Lagrangian variation [formula], of Φ0 is really a Hamiltonian variation. In fact, it is not difficult to check that the normal component of the variation vector field [formula] is [formula], where [formula] is the function given by

[formula]

On the other hand, a longer but easy computation says that the area A(t) of the induced metric on [formula] by Φt is given by

[formula]

where s  =  c1  +  c2 and d  =  (c1  -  c2) cosh (2t).

So it is easy to see that A(t) has a maximum at t = 0 and, in addition, lim t  →    ∞A(t) = 0 (see Figure 1). These two facts imply the following conclusion:

The Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian immersion Φ0 is unstable and there are no minimizers for the area in its Hamiltonian isotopy class.
