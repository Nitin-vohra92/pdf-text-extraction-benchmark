The Derivative Expansion of the Effective Action and the Renormalization Group Equation

Introduction

In the massless φ44 model whose classical action is S=(φ)(φ) -φ , the effective Lagrangian in the presence of a background field [formula] can be expressed in powers of the derivatives of [formula] so that [\cite=1] =-V(φ(0))+Z(φ(0)) φ(0)φ(0)+ . (Henceforth, [formula] will be simply denoted by φ.) The effective potential V can be computed using either diagrammatic [\cite=1] or functional methods [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4]; in both cases divergences arise which require a renormalization. Consequently, V has explicitly dependence on a renormalization scale parameter μ. Since is unphysical, there must be implicit dependence of V on through and φ so that [formula]. This leads to the "renormalization group" (RG) equation. Solving this equation perturbatively allows one to find in closed form the sum of all the so-called "leading-log" (LL), "next-to-leading-log" (NLL) etc. contributions to V. Applying this technique in the massless standard model leads to a prediction of a Higgs mass of approximately 220 Gev [\cite=5] [\cite=6]. Furthermore, the on shell renormalization condition =λ has been shown to fix V entirely in terms of the RG functions associated with this scheme [\cite=7]. This is also true in massless scalar electrodynamics [\cite=8]. The renormalization group has also been applied to analyzing V in Refs. [\cite=18] [\cite=19] [\cite=20] [\cite=21] [\cite=21p5].

The RG equation can also be used to extract information about the kinetic term Z(φ) occurring in equation . In this paper, we follow the approach of Refs. [\cite=7] [\cite=8] to show how Z(φ) is in fact completely fixed by the RG functions in much the same manner that is determined. No Feynman diagrams need to be evaluated in the course of determining Z. Again, we consider the φ44 model of eq. and massless scalar electrodynamics. The need to perform explicit perturbative calculation of Z through evaluation of Feynman diagrams (as in Refs. [\cite=12] [\cite=13] [\cite=14]) is completely circumvented.

The function Z(φ) is of particular interest, as if is the value of that minimizes V, so that V'(v)=0, then the radiatively induced mass of the scalar is given by [\cite=1] M=V"(v)/Z(v). In the discussion of the radiatively induced Higgs mass in the standard model in Ref. [\cite=5] [\cite=6], Z(φ) was taken to be close to its classical value of one.

Z(φ) in the φ44 model

Applying the condition μ Z(φ)φφ =0 to the kinetic term in the effective Lagrangian of eq. results in μ+β(λ)+γ(λ)φ+2γ(λ) Z(λ,φ,μ)=0, where in eq. β(λ)μ γ(λ) and the dependence of Z on and as well as has been explicitly noted.

Divergences which arise in the computation of Z require imposition of a renormalization condition. The condition we chose is Z(λ,φ=μ,μ)=1 . This is an "on shell" condition, much the same as the condition on given in eq. [\cite=1].

The general form of β(λ), γ(λ) and Z(λ,φ,μ) when the renormalization condition of eq. is applied is β(λ) bλ γ(λ) gλ and Z(λ,φ,μ)= TλL, where [formula]. There are several ways of rearranging the sum in eq. , one being the "vertical" reorganization so that Z=A(λ)L where A(λ)=Tλ another being the "diagonal" reorganization Z=λS(λ L) where S(λ L)=T(λ L). The function Sm(λL) is the NmLL contribution to Z.

We now will show that the RG equations when applied to Z written in the form of eq. allows one to express Am(λ) in terms of A0(λ). Substitution of eq. into eq. results in -2+2γ(λ) mL+ β(λ)+2γ(λ) L A(λ)=0, which shows that at each order of L A(λ)= (λ)+2(λ) A(λ) where [formula] and [formula].

If now we define A(λ)=exp -2dx B(λ), and η(λ)=2 , then eq. becomes B(λ) B(λ(η)) B(λ(η)). The sum in eq. now becomes Z exp -2dxB(λ(η)) or exp -2 dx A(λ(η(λ)+L)), showing that Z itself can be expressed in terms of A0 and the RG equations and γ.

If now we impose the renormalization conditions of eq. , then as L = 0 when φ2  =  μ2 and λ(η) = λ, we see that eq. becomes A(λ)=1 . With A0(λ) having been so fixed, is seen now to be determined solely by the RG functions and evaluated in the renormalization scheme of eqs. and .

It is also convenient to examine the consequence of substituting eq. into , along with expansions of eqs. and . This results in -2+2 gλ +gλ+ λ S'+λ S'+λ S'+ + bλ+bλ+ S+2λ S+3λ S+ + S'+λ S'+λ S'+ +2 gλ+gλ+ S+λ S +λ S+ =0. Here, Sm is evaluated at [formula]. At order λm + 1, eq. generates a differential equation expressing Sm(ξ) in terms of [formula] as the following 2g+bξ S'(ξ)+ 2g+ibξ S(ξ)=0, where we have defined a constant [formula].

We now impose the renormalization condition of eq. ; this combined with eq. shows that 1= λ S(0) so that Sm(0) = δm0. This serves as the boundary condition to the differential equations for Sm(ξ).

As g1 = 0 [\cite=11], eqs. have the following solution S(ξ)= a+ a(ln w) where w = 1 - b2ξ / 2 and am0 and amij are constants in terms of the coefficients bn ~ (n  ≤  m + 1) and gn ~ (n  ≤  m + 1) of RG functions β and γ. In particular, the solutions to S0 to S4 are S(ξ)= 1 S(ξ)= -2g+ S(ξ)= 2g+bg-gb-+ 2g-bg+gb-2bgln w S(ξ)= -2 bg- gb- bbg+g+ bg - ggb-2g-bg .          + 4bgln w -2 -bg+bbg-bg+gb+ggb+2g          + ( 2bg (ln w)-2(2bg+bbg)ln w          .-2 -gb- gb-bgb+ bgb-ggb+bg+bg-g ) S(ξ)= bgb+bgb+bbg-bgb-gb -2bbg-bbgb+3bg..           .-bgb +bg-3ggb+2ggb+g           + bbg-2g+bggb-bg+3ggb-3bg-ggb          + 2(-2bg-bg+bggb). ln w           . -bg-gbg+2bgb(b+g)-gb+4gb+bgb -5bg-bgb+4g+4bbg           + ( 4( bg b+ bggb- bg+2 bg+bbgb y) ln w-4 bg(ln w ).           + (2 bggb-3 bbg-3 gbg+6 bg-12 gb-2 ggb+3 bgb.          ..-4 g-10 bbg-6 ggb+10 bg) )          + (-2 bg (ln w)+( 6 bg+3 bgb+2 bg)(ln w)           + (6 gb+ gb+ gb-gb+ bbg+4 bbg+3 ggb+2 ggb+ gbg .           . + bgb- bbgb- bggb- bgb- bgb+g-3 bg- bg+g)           + (-4 bg+4 bg-4 bbgb-6 bgb-2 bgb+2 bg-6 bggb)ln w)]. In eqs. ([\ref=s0sol]-[\ref=s4sol]) we have not only the complete five-loop contribution to Z without having to compute any Feynman diagrams, but also the LL, [formula], N4LL contribution to Z coming from all orders of perturbation theory. The LL result of eq. is consistent with the perturbative calculations of Z [\cite=12] [\cite=13] [\cite=14]. We note that it is not a solution to the RG equation when β and γ are truncated to lowest order; the solution to this equation involves contributions from parts of Sm (m  ≥  1). The solution is completely determined by the RG functions.

The RG functions and used to this point are these associated with the renormalization conditions of eq. and . As was pointed out in Ref. [\cite=15] and further developed in Refs. [\cite=7] [\cite=8], the mass scale μ2 used in this on shell scheme is related to the mass scale [formula] used in the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme through =λμ so that if [formula] and [formula] are the RG functions in the MS scheme, then β(λ)= and γ(λ)= . The functions [formula] and [formula] are given up to five loop order in Ref. [\cite=16]; this in turn gives and to five loop order [\cite=7]. Explicit expressions for the MS RG functions [formula] and [formula] up to five loop order appear in Ref. [\cite=7], so that [formula] can be given in terms of MS RG functions. This permits determining Z up to order N4LL exactly, when using the renormalization condition of eq. . Finding in some other scheme such as MS would require explicit computation of the boundary condition Sn(0) through evaluation of Feynman diagrams in that renormalization scheme. Recall also that the quantity L in the MS scheme has explicit dependence on λ.

We now consider massless scalar electrodynamics.

Z(φ) in massless scalar electrodynamics

In this section we examine massless scalar electrodynamics, whose classical action is S= ( +ie)φ ( -ie)φ-( A- )-(φφ) . This is dependent on two coupling constants, and [formula].

The effective action in the presence of a background field φ and a background gauge field Aμ can be expanded in powers of derivatives of these background fields leading to = -V(φ)-H(φ)(F)+ Z(φ)|φ-ie φ|+, where all fields are evaluated at some fixed point. The form of the dependence of [formula] on and Aμ is restricted by gauge invariance.

We again focus on the function Z(φ) associated with kinetic term for the scalar field. Once more, we apply an "on shell" renormalization condition [\cite=1] Z(φφ=μ)=1. The function can be evaluated perturbatively, leading to a general expansion Z(λ,α,φ,μ)= TλαL, where L =  ln (φ*φ  /  μ2) with μ2 again being the renormalization scalar parameter. The RG equation is now μ+β(λ,α) + β(λ,α) +γ(λ,α)φ+ 2γ(λ,α) Z =0 where β(λ,α) μ=β,  β= bλα , β(λ,α) μ=β,  β= bλα , and γ(λ,α) =γ,  γ= gλα. (The product eAμ is not renormalized [\cite=17] with suitable gauge fixing. )

The kinetic term of eq. depends now on two couplings λ and α; this is what makes the discussion of in massless scalar electrodynamics more complicated than in the pure massless φ44 model, where Z in eq. depends on only a single coupling λ. It turns out to be advantageous to define [\cite=8] P(λ,α)= Tλα so that by eq. Z(φ)=P(λ,α) L . Just as Sm(λL) of eq. is identified with the NmLL contribution to in the massless φ44 model, so also we find that the NnLL contribution to in massless scalar electrodynamics is given by Z=PL. With the renormalization condition of eq. , we have P=δ.

Substitution of eq. into results in 2k(-1+ γ)PL+ β+β PL+2γPL=0. Each of the quantities Pkn, βλn, βαn and γn are of the form [formula], i.e., they are polynomials of degree in and α. By having each term of order k in and of order in and in eq. equaling zero, we obtain a series of coupled partial differential equations with the boundary condition of eq. that can be solved for each of the Pkn in turn. For example, if in equation we were to consider the term of zeroth order in and first order in the coupling, we have -2P+2γP=0. This, combined with eq. , determines P11. In general, if in eq. we examine terms of order in and order (n + 1) in the coupling, then P= β+β+γ P . This fixes all the LL contributions to ZLL of eq. in terms of βλ2, βα2 and γ1. One could obtain each of the coefficients Tn - r,r,n contributing to Pnn in eq. in terms of bλ2 - r,r, bα2 - r,r and g1 - r,r directly from eq. .

The coefficients Pnn + 1 that contribute to ZNLL can also be found from the RG equation of eq. . To do this we consider these terms in eq. that are of order in and order (n + 2) in the couplings, P-γP= β+β+γ P +β+β+γ P .

Having determined each of the coefficients Tn - r,r,n that contribute to Pnn from eq. , we can now use eq. to fix the coefficients Tn + 1 - r,r,n that go into Pnn + 1 provided βλ3, βα3 and γ2 are known. The boundary condition P01 = 0 which follows from eq. is also employed.

As in Ref. [\cite=8], a variant of the method of characteristics can be used to find a closed form expression for the sums occurring in ZLL and ZNLL. We start by defining W((t), (t),t)=exp 2γ((τ),(τ))dτ P((t),(t)) where the characteristic functions [formula] and [formula] satisfy =β((t),(t)) ,   (0)=λ, =β((t),(t)) ,   (0)=α. The forms of βλ2 and βα2 appear in Ref. [\cite=1], as well as the solution for [formula] and [formula]. Differentiating with respect to t gives W((t),(t),t)= β(,)+ β(,)+2γ(,) W((t),(t),t). Together, equations , and show that W=W= W. If now (t)=W((t),(t),t) where =ln with =(t) ,  (0)=μ,  so that (t)=μ e, then by (t)= W((t),(t),t)= W(t+), (t+),t+. Furthermore, eqs. ([\ref=wdef])-([\ref=chal]), ([\ref=barczdef])-([\ref=chmu]) show that (0)=Z and so by eqs. and , Z= exp 2 γ((τ),(τ))dτ. Since L = 0 when φ*φ  =  μ2, the renormalization condition of eq. is satisfied.

Next we take (t)=W((t), (t),t) so that (0)=Z. By eqs. and , we find that W= β+ β +2γ W+ β+β +2γ W +γW. Using eqs. and, this equation becomes W β+ β +2γ W.      .+ β+β +2γ +γ β+β +2γ W W+(t)W. Iterating eq. and again using eq. , we find that W = W+(t)W++ (t)W + (t)W. Using identity   fg+ f + + f+f φ g -φg  (φ'=f), eq. reduces to W = W +(t)W -(t)W , where [formula], so that (t)W((t),(t),t)= β(τ),(τ) + +2γ(τ),(τ) dτ W(t),(t),t and (t)W((t),(t),t) = β((t),(t)) + +2γ((t),(t)) W((t),(t),t) + β((τ),(τ))++2γ((τ),(τ)) dτW((t),(t),t). Eqs. and ensure consistency between eqs. and . It is important to note that in eqs. and [formula] and [formula] are evaluated at t when they appear in the arguments of W00 and also that derivatives with respect to [formula] and [formula] are also computed with [formula] and [formula] evaluated at t. In eq. , the ordinary derivative d / dt acts on [formula] prior to functional derivatives [formula] and [formula]. The last step to be performed on the right hand side of eq. is the integration over τ. Eq. now can be written as (t)= W((t),(t),t)+(t)W((t),(t),t) -(t)W((t),(t),t). The sum over in eq. can now be performed and upon setting t = 0 and using eq. we obtain Z(0)=W ,, + W ,, provided (0) = 0 (i.e., we select t0 = 0). We thus have a closed form expression for ZNLL. The renormalization condition of eq. further reduces it to Z= exp 2γ(τ),(τ) dτ =2dτγ(τ)+ γ(τ)expγ((τ), (τ))dτ.

The closed form of ZN2LL term could be obtained in a similar manner. In eq. , consider the terms that are of order n of L and of order (n + 3) in the couplings, P-γ P+γ P β +β+2γ P. .+ β+ β+2γ P + β + β+2γ P. Using eqs. and , we obtain W W + γβ+β+2γ+β+β+2γ W.   + (γ+γ)β+β+2γ+γβ+β+2γ.   +..β +β+2γ W W+(t)W+(t)W. Iterating this equation n times and again using and , it is found W W+(t) W+(t)W -(t)(t)W.    + (t) W+(t)W -(t)(t) W    +    +(t) W+(t)W -(t)(t)W    .+(t)W+ (t)W + +(t)W. Using eqs. and and the boundary condition , it is found that Z=(0) - W ,, - + exp 2γ(τ),(τ) dτ where [formula], [formula], [formula] with equations analogous to eqs. and being satisfied and we have set 0(0) = 0, 1(0) = 0 and 10(0) = 0.

For ZNmLL,(m > 2), we easily see from the derivation of ZLL, ZNLL and ZN2LL in eqs. , and , that every ZNmLL is in the form of some operator m applied to W00, i.e., Z= exp 2γ(τ),(τ) dτ. The and functions to order βλm + 2, βαm + 2 and γm + 1 uniquely determine the operator m, which in turn fixes Z(φ) to order NmLL.

From eq. it follows that ZLL = 1 if φ2  =  μ2 ~ (L = 0) while from eqs. ([\ref=nllsol],[\ref=znnllres],[\ref=zmres]) we see that ZNpLL = 0 ~ (p > 0) in this limit. This is consistent with the renormalization condition of eq. . If we take μ = v, then it is apparent that Z(v) in eq. is just equal to one. The RG function used in deriving eqs. , , and are those associated with the "on shell" renormalization conditions of eq. and or .

Discussion

We have demonstrated that the kinetic term in the derivative expansion of the effective Lagrangian can be determined entirely by the "on shell" RG functions in the massless φ44 model. The LL , NLL, N2LL have similarly been computed in massless scalar electrodynamics. This is a necessary ingredient in determining the radiatively generated mass in these models, as is shown by eq. .

There are several avenues that should be further explored. For example, we should show that terms in the derivative expansion of the effective Lagrangian beyond the kinetic term for the scalar field are expressible in terms of the RG functions. We should also consider the effect of inserting a mass for the scalar fields in the classical Lagrangian considered here.

Possibly the most important question is to see if the techniques employed here and in Ref. [\cite=7] [\cite=8] can be used to compute more precisely the Higgs mass in the massless standard model, thereby improving on the estimates of Refs. [\cite=5] [\cite=6]. This is currently being undertaken [\cite=22]. Acknowledgements
