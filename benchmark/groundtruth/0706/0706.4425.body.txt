A simple model of Coulomb disorder and screening in graphene

Recent experiments on the gate voltage dependent 2D transport of graphene deposited at SiO substrate [\cite=Novoselov04] [\cite=Novoselov05] [\cite=Kim05] attracted almost unprecedented theoretical attention (see, for example [\cite=Mirlin] [\cite=Sarma] [\cite=Adam] [\cite=Galitski] [\cite=MacDonald] [\cite=Aleiner], and references therein). Clean graphene has zero mass Dirac relativistic spectrum near the Fermi level (ε  =  0), where energies ε of both electrons and holes behave as

[formula]

Here the velocity v≃106 m/s and k is absolute value of electron wave vector. Density of states for such a (four times degenerate) spectrum ν(ε)  =  2ε  /  π2v2 vanishes at ε  =  0. Only states with a negative energy are filled in a clean graphene sample.

Experimental measurements of the electrical conductivity and the Hall effect voltage strongly indicate presence of disorder. Most of the theoretical discussion is focused around observed phenomenon of saturation of the linear dependence of two-dimensional conductivity σ on the gate voltage at small gate voltages, where the conductivity reaches the minimum value σ  =  σmin  =  Ce2 / h. Particular attention is attracted by the constant C in this formula [\cite=Mirlin] [\cite=Aleiner].

In this note we concentrate on the width of the conductivity minimum. Using the linear relation between gate voltage and concentration of electrons we characterize this width by the concentration n  =  n0, where saturation starts. The hint to the meaning of n  =  n0 follows from the Hall effect data, well fitted by the so-called two band model, which assumes simultaneous presence of electrons and holes even at zero gate voltage [\cite=Novoselov04]. It was suggested [\cite=Katsnelson] [\cite=Sarma] [\cite=Adam] [\cite=Galitski] that one can understand these phenomena assuming that potential of charged impurities moves the Dirac point up and down in different points of space creating alternating in space electron and hole puddles. Theoretical self-consistent calculations of the random potential and carrier distribution [\cite=Sarma] [\cite=Adam] [\cite=Galitski] so far were based on models of two-dimensional distribution of charged impurities, which require at least two parameters, the total two-dimensional concentration of impurities and width of the layer near the surface they reside.

Here we would like to suggest a simple model of distribution of charged impurities and a theory of their nonlinear screening. Below we assume that there is three-dimensional concentration N / 2 of both positive and negative centers randomly distributed in the bulk of SiO substrate and estimate all mentioned above quantities in terms of the single parameter of the model N. We estimate the concentrations of electrons and holes n0 at the zero gate voltage (or, more exactly, in the center of minimum of conductivity), the characteristic spatial scale R0 of nonlinearly screened potential (which gives the size of the typical electron or hole puddle and the distance between neighboring electron puddles) and the typical number of carriers in a puddle in terms of N. For this purpose we study screening of the random potential of 3D impurities by a graphene sample.

Nonlinear screening of the random potential of charges impurities by electron and hole puddles was first studied for three-dimensional totally compensated semiconductors [\cite=ES1972] [\cite=ES1986] [\cite=book]. Following these works we start from calculation of the random potential with the spatial scale R. We imagine that all oxide is divided in cubes with the edge length R. Each cube has average number of impurities NR3 and fluctuating excessive charge of either sign e(NR3)1 / 2. This charge creates the random potential fluctuating from a cube to cube with the amplitude of the order of

[formula]

where κ  ~  2.5 is the effective dielectric constant at the oxide surface. Here and everywhere below we drop numerical coefficients making only order of magnitude estimates. All the cubes adjacent to the surface of oxide apply this potential to the graphene sample. At zero gate voltage (in conductivity minimum) there are no electrons and holes without this potential. The random potential moves ε  =  0 point up and down and creates electrons in its wells and holes on its hills. Let us concentrate on electrons. Electrons screen a typical well of the size R almost completely if they can fit in this well in the number equal to the well charge. The concentration of electrons necessary for neutralization of the well charge is

[formula]

Let us assume that the wavelength of these electrons n- 1 / 2 is smaller than R, or nR2  ≫  1, so that the Fermi energy of them electrons can be estimated in the Thomas-Fermi approximation,

[formula]

If EF(R)  ≪  eV(R) all electrons compensating the well charge are localized inside the well close to its bottom and are fragmented in space by the random potential of even smaller sizes. Thus we are dealing with nonlinear screening when concentration of electrons is strongly nonuniform.

The process of fragmentation of electron liquid continues until eV(R)  ≫  EF(R). It stops at such R = R0, where EF(R0)  =  eV(R0). This gives equation for R0

[formula]

which yields R0  =  N- 1 / 3(e2  /  κ- 4 / 3. Using v  =  108 cm/s we get that e2  /  κ  ~  0.8 and R0  ~  N- 1 / 3. The smallest wells of the size R0 are not fragmented and form what one may call electron puddles. A typical puddle has one or two electrons. Groups of one of two negative impurities at the distance N- 1 / 3 from graphene form hole puddles. Condition nR2  ≫  1 used above is only marginally correct, so that the whole calculation is only an order of magnitude estimate.

Now we can estimate the two-dimensional concentrations of electrons and holes. Each of them occupy half of space with the concentration

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=NO]) is the main result of our paper. It gives the two-dimensional concentration of coexisting electrons and holes n0 in graphene in terms of a single parameter of our model, three-dimensional concentration N of charged impurities. It could be easily anticipated because this is the only formula with necessary dimensionality one can make from N. There are no large or small dimensionless parameters in the system, which could play the role of large or small coefficient in Eq. ([\ref=NO]). Indeed, the single dimensionless parameter e2  /  κ is close to unity.

Above we are using the term puddle size for the smallest scale of fragmentation of electron and hole density. Although electrons and holes are really located in such small puddles there are fluctuations of the electron density at larger scales R  ≫  N- 1 / 3. At such scales the electron density follows Gaussian fluctuations of the density of impurity charges. For example, for domains of size R the electron concentration n(R) is given by Eq. ([\ref=NR]) and is much smaller than n0. Although some people may refer to these domains also as "puddles", they are actually small gaussian fluctuations of the density of puddles of one or two electrons we are talking about. In other words, in the plane of graphene large scales of the random potential R  ≫  R0 are screened linearly, by small variations n(R) around the average concentration n0 of electrons and holes situated in puddles. One can check that at e2  /  κ  ~  1 the linear screening radius corresponding to the two-dimensional concentration n0 is equal to R0.

Recently both the concentration of carriers n0 and the characteristic size of puddles R0, were estimated by compressibility measurements based on the use of the scanning single electron transistor [\cite=Yacoby]. The authors arrived at n0  =  2.3 ~ 1011cm- 2 and R0  =  30 nm. These numbers result approximately in n0R20  ~  2 electrons per puddle in a good agreement with our estimates. Using Eq. ([\ref=NO]) we can also estimate that the three-dimensional concentration of charges in the silicon oxide substrate N  ~  1017 cm- 3, what is not unreasonable.

We would like to emphasize that while working with limited resolution authors of Ref. [\cite=Yacoby] saw domains of fluctuations of density of electrons with larger sizes R  ≫  R0, but with much smaller concentrations n(R)  ≪  n0. They noticed that n(R) increases with the decreasing scale R, and improving experimental resolution traced observed gaussian dependence of n(R) to the smallest scale cited above. Their observations are in agreement with our picture.

In the recent paper [\cite=Aleiner] authors suggested a theory of graphene conductivity assuming existence of macroscopic puddles totally filled by electrons and holes and separated by narrow p-n junctions. In other words, they assumed that each electron puddle has many electrons. We see that in our model macroscopic approach to puddles is not justified. This may lead to some numerical changes in calculation of constant C in the expression for σmin above and in the shape of the conductivity versus gate voltage curve near the minimum, but definitely will not change the qualitative conclusions of Ref. [\cite=Aleiner].

Note that fragmentation of the electron density in graphene into puddles of one or two electron is not an exclusive feature of the model of three-dimensional distribution of impurities. Similar results follow from random distribution of charges in a two-dimensional plane close to graphene [\cite=Sarma] [\cite=Adam] [\cite=Galitski]. Note also a difficulty with application of the model of this paper for evaluation of the Coulomb scattering limited mobility of electrons at large concentrations n  ≫  n0. Indeed at large Fermi wave vectors ~  n1 / 2 electrons are strongly scattered only by the the Coulomb centers at the distance of the electron wavelength n- 1 / 2  ≪  N- 1 / 3 from the graphene plane. In other words, electrons do not "see" more distant centers. As a result the mobility should increase proportionally to n1 / 2. This prediction is in contradiction with the observed independent on n mobility, which in turn is well explained by Coulomb impurities residing in graphene [\cite=MacDonald]. This may be a strong argument for the dominating role of charged centers located in graphene in the currently studied samples. But even if this is proven, in future charges in graphene may be neutralized or eliminated. Then one will arrive to the case the bulk charged impurities discussed here.
