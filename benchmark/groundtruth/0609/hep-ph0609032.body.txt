On Vud determination from kaon decays

Introduction

Flavor transitions within and between different quark generations due to the weak charged interactions are described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitary mixing-matrix [\cite=Cabibbo] [\cite=KM].

[formula]

This approach is founded on a pure phenomenological basis and the determination of the matrix elements is completely based on experimental data. If different types of experiments provide a consistent values for a particular matrix element, this should point to the correctness of our results. Therefore, new ideas about systematically independent measurements are welcome.

Often all new things are well forgotten old ones, however, from time to time they appear in the scientific literature without citing the sources. The subject that we will present concerns the determination of the well defined matrix element Vud. Therefore, it could be sometimes and somewhere discussed. We apologize for eventual plagiarism, nevertheless, we would like to point to a new possibility to measure this quantity in kaon β decays.

Up to now the most precision determination of this value follows from the superallowed 0+  →  0+ nuclear β-decay experiments [\cite=Hardy] [\cite=Savard]. Based on the data from over 100 different experiments and using a new method for controlling hadronic uncertainties in the radiative correction to superallowed nuclear beta decays along with refinements from [\cite=CMS], Marciano and Sirlin [\cite=Vud] have derived the adopted at present PDG value [\cite=PDG]

[formula]

However, a recent modern determination of the Q-value [\cite=Savard] of the superallowed decay of the radioactive nuclei 46V, obtained from the mass difference of 46V and its decay daughter 46Ti, gives a new Q-value and invalidates the set of its seven previous measurements. This value affects the evaluation of Vud from superallowed nuclear decays and leads to a somewhat lower value for Vud. It may indicate a problem with Q-values of the other superallowed emitters used for Vud determination.

Therefore, independent determination of Vud from other experiments is needed. The second precise evaluation of Vud value, with bigger than superallowed transition uncertainties, is obtained from the measurements of the neutron lifetime and the β asymmetry coefficient A [\cite=PERKEO]. The later measurements are necessary in order to fix the unknown contribution of the axial-vector nuclear matrix element into the neutron decay rate, which is the main source of uncertainty for Vud extraction.

Using the most precise updated value for the ratio λ exp = gA / gV =  - 1.2733(13) [\cite=Mund] of the axial coupling constant to the vector coupling constant and the PDG value for the neutron lifetime τn = 885.7(8) s, one can evaluate Vud as [\cite=Vud]

[formula]

This value is 1.5σ lower than the extracted one ([\ref=Vud]) from superallowed nuclear decays and may indicate the presence of new interactions. Their effect, predicted in the [\cite=neutron], leads to the corrected value of λ =  - 1.2714(13) and to more consistent |Vud| = 0.97339(101) value.

However, the extracted from the neutron decays Vud value depends on the experimentally measured neutron lifetime, for which present situation is unclear due to the most recent result [\cite=Serebrov] τn = 878.5(8). Nevertheless, precision and consistent λ determinations from several correlation coefficient measurements, which are ongoing and planned, would indicate reliable experimental results and would be able to put more stringent constraints on new physics.

And the last but not least important source of information about Vud is the very clean theoretically 0-  →  0- pion β decay π+  →  π0e+ν. It is a pure vector transition and is free from nuclear structure uncertainties. However, due to the small pion mass difference it has a very weak branch, of the order of 10- 8, which leads to severe experimental difficulties. Nevertheless, the PIBETA Collaboration [\cite=PIBETA], using the Paul Scherrer Institute facilities, has improved the experimental uncertainty for this mode up to 0.6% and quotes

[formula]

Therefore, to reach the precision of Vud determination from superallowed nuclear decay ([\ref=Vud]) tenfold improvements both in statistics and systematics are necessary. One hopes that with the development of high-intensity proton drivers, this aim can be reached.

It is worth nothing here, that besides excellent possibility for pion and muon physics, these facilities give a unique possibility for kaon physics as well. For example, a CP violation beyond the Standard Model can be searched in rare kaon decays with branching ratios 10- 10 - 10- 12. One of the background processes is 0-  →  0- kaon β decay K0  →  K+e-, which can give an additional information about Vud value. We are going to discuss this in the next section.

Kaon beta decays

The kaon β decay K0  →  K+e- is completely analogous to the pion beta decay π-  →  π0e-. It can serve as a possibility to extract Vud matrix element, because the strange quark s does not participate in the weak interactions and play a spectator role. As far as the final kaon is not a stable particle, it can be registered through its decay modes. From our point of view, the most probable decay channel K+  →  μ+ν is not appropriate for the final state identification, because the two neutral neutrinos escape from registration. Therefore, pure hadronic modes, mainly K+  →  π+π0 decays, are very suitable for this.

It is interesting to note, that the experimental signature of these decays K0  →  π+π0e- does not fulfill ΔS  =  ΔQ selection rule, in contrast to the allowed Ke4 decays K0  →  π-π0e+ν, but indicates the presence of ΔS  =    -  ΔQ weak transitions. This situation is completely analogous to the experimental puzzle of the beginning of sixties with the observation of Σ+  →  nμ+ν decays [\cite=1962], which later have been realized as background [\cite=Cronin].

So, let us consider the background events

[formula]

to get a valuable information about the first CKM matrix element. In order to obtain competitive with ([\ref=pVud]) result, we need to keep all uncertainties of the order of 10- 3. The amplitude of the first semileptonic decay in ([\ref=Kdecay])

[formula]

is expressed through the form factors f+ and f- of hadronic matrix element 〈K+(p')|ūγμd|K0(p)〉 multiplied by the leptonic current

[formula]

In general, the form factors depend on the square of the momentum transfer to the lepton pair qμ = (p - p')μ. However, even for the pion β decay the Dalitz plot integral is practically insensitive to this dependence [\cite=Cirigliano], and the form factors can be considered as constants. We can also neglect the form factor f-, which is proportional to the small isospin mass difference m2π+ - m2π0, and in SU(2) symmetry limit is equal to zero. Moreover, it is multiplied on the momentum transfer qμ, which effectively leads to the small contribution in the Dalitz plot distribution, proportional to (me / mK0)2  ≈  10- 6.

Furthermore, for kaon β decay, in which the initial and final hadrons belong to an I = 1 / 2 multiplet, f+ = 1 with good precision. Isospin corrections in first non-zero approximation are given by the formula [\cite=ChPT]

[formula]

They are negligibly small in accordance to the Ademollo-Gatto theorem [\cite=AD].

Therefore, the rate of kaon β decay is given by the well-known formula [\cite=tK]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is kaon mass difference [\cite=PDG], ε = (me  /  Δ)2, and the Fermi function f is given by

[formula]

while δ represents the effect of the radiative corrections.

The second decay in ([\ref=Kdecay]) is pure hadronic decay with an experimental branching ratio [\cite=PDG]

[formula]

Therefore, the rate of K0  →  π+π0e- decay ([\ref=Kdecay]) can be estimated as

[formula]

This decay channel has been proposed to measure the kaon mass difference Δ, due to its clear signature and very high sensitivity of the kaon β decay to the latter [\cite=Jaffe].

However, K0 and q0 states are not invariant under CP symmetry transformation and do not represent physical states. Instead |KS〉  =  p|K0〉 + q|q0〉 and |KL〉  =  p  |K0〉 - q|q0〉 combinations are assigned to the physical mesons KS and KL, respectively. In the case of CP invariance, [formula], KS represents CP even and KL CP odd states. Using PDG fit value for mean life of KL meson [\cite=PDG]

[formula]

one can estimate the branching ratio of the sum of the two-step decay ([\ref=Kdecay]) and its CP transformed

[formula]

as

[formula]

Discussion and conclusions

In this section we would like to discuss the experimental possibility of Vud extraction from decays ([\ref=KLdecay]) with an accuracy not worse than the one from pion β decays. As far as this decays have very small branching ratio, one needs high-intensity beam provided in average 107 KL-decays per second. Probably, the best place for such measurements is the 50 GeV Proton Synchrotron at JHF. In order to derive the rate of the two-step process ([\ref=Kdecay]) from ([\ref=BK]) one needs to know with a good precision the lifetime of KL meson or some of its branching ratios. The present accuracy of the lifetime ([\ref=tKL]) δτKL  /  τKL  ≈  4  ×  10- 3 is already good enough and contributes to Vud error at the level of 2  ×  10- 3.

The uncertainty in the determination of the rate of kaon β decays, according to ([\ref=K02pi]), comes from the experimental accuracy of the branching ratio ([\ref=Kp2pi]) of hadronic mode of the charged kaon decays δB / B  ≈  6  ×  10- 3. Its contribution into Vud error, 3  ×  10- 3, is also competitive with pion β decay uncertainty. It may be improved in future, because the last direct measurement of this ratio has been done more than thirty years ago [\cite=Chiang].

Speaking about the experimental selection of the rare process ([\ref=Kdecay]) we should note that the main background to it comes from Ke4 decay with branching ratio (5.21  ±  0.11)  ×  10- 5 [\cite=NA48]. The difference in ΔS  =  ΔQ selection rule can be used for discrimination of these decays in the case of tagged K0, q0 beams. However, it cannot help in the case of KL beam, containing both K0 and q0 meson states. Nevertheless, these decays can be well separated kinematically. First of all, the two pions in the final state of ([\ref=Kdecay]) come with definite invariant mass Mππ = mK+ from the two-particle K+ decay and apart from KL decay point. In the same time Ke4 process is three body decay and its distribution in Mππ variable has a continuous spectrum with the maximum at 340 MeV and follows decreasing to the end. Good knowledge of the form factors [\cite=Pais] of Ke4 process allows us to subtract background under the peak from process ([\ref=Kdecay]) around mK+.

The last and the main source of the uncertainty in Vud determination comes from the K0 - K+ mass difference ([\ref=DK]), which enters into the rate of kaon β decay ([\ref=tKbeta]) in the fifth power. It leads to inappropriate contribution to δVud / Vud  ≈  1.7  ×  10- 2. Experimental situation at present resembles the one in the 1986 for mπ+ - mπ0 pion mass difference, when its uncertainty was almost completely determined by the uncertainty in the neutral-pion mass measurements [\cite=Dpi]. Taking into account the recent considerable progress in kaon study, one hopes that new measurements of K0 mass [\cite=K0mass] and directly K0 - K+ mass difference will be made.

We did not discuss the radiative corrections δ and their uncertainties for kaon β decay. Most probably they can be calculated in the same lines as for pion β decay [\cite=Cirigliano].

In this letter we have proposed the theoretical possibility to extract Vud matrix element from kaon β decay. We have given only primeval experimental insights for the registration of this process and the estimation of the main uncertainties. Of course, in order to provide an experimental realization of this project, a systematical study of such a project is necessary. It will be interesting to analyze the possibility of such measurements within the proposed project [\cite=Hsiung] searching KL  →  π0ν decay.
