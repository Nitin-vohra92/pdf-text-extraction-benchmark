Extremal functions for Moser-Trudinger type inequality on compact closed 4-manifolds

Introduction

It is well-known that Moser-Trudinger type inequalities are crucial analytic tools in the study of partial differential equations arising from geometry and physics.

In fact, much work has been done on such inequalities and their applications in the last decades, see for example, [\cite=adr], [\cite=bw], [\cite=csya], [\cite=cy], [\cite=dm], [\cite=mn], [\cite=p], and the references therein.

There are two important objects in the study of Moser-Trudinger type inequalities: one is to find the best constant and the other is to determine whether there exist extremal functions.

For the best constant there are the celebrated work of Moser[\cite=mo] and the extension to higher order derivatives by Adams [\cite=adr] on flat spaces. In the context of curved spaces Fontana has extended the results of Adams, see [\cite=fl].

To mention results about extremal functions, we cite the results of Carleson and Chang [\cite=cc], Flucher [\cite=fm] and Lin [\cite=lin] in the Euclidean case and the results of Li [\cite=ly1], [\cite=ly2] in the curved one. In [\cite=ly1] and [\cite=ly2] the author have proved the existence of an extremal function for the classic Moser-Trudinger inequality on a compact manifold under a constraint involving only the first derivatives.

In this paper, we will extend the results of Li to a compact closed four dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold under a constraint involving the Laplacian. More precisely we prove the following Theorems

On the 4 - dimensional manifold  (M,g) , the so-called Paneitz operator, which is defined in terms of the scalar curvature Rg and the Ricci tensor  Ricg as plays an important role in conformal geometry see [\cite=csya], [\cite=cy], [\cite=cgy2], [\cite=dm], [\cite=g], [\cite=nd], [\cite=p1]. In particular, the relation between the Paneitz operator and the  Q-curvature, which is defined as

[formula]

is of great interest. It is well-known that Moser-Trudinger inequalities involving  P4g  play an important role in the problem of prescribing constant  Q-curvature see [\cite=dm], [\cite=Li-Li-Liu], [\cite=nd]. Therefore it is worth having an extension of Theorem [formula]  concerning the Paneitz operator as well. Our next result goes in this direction. More precisely we have the following.

Since the leading term of  P4g( for the definition see the Section 2) is  Δ2g then the two Theorems are quite similar. We point out that the same proof is valid for both except some trivial adaptations, hence we will give a full proof of Theorem [formula] only and sketch the proof of Theorem [formula] in the last section.

We mention that due to a result by Gursky, see [\cite=g] if both the Yamabe class  Y(g) and [formula] are non-negative, then we have that  P4g is non-negative and  [formula].

We are going to describe our approach to prove Theorem [formula]. We will use Blow-up analysis. First of all we take a sequence  (αk)k  such that  [formula], and by using Direct Methods of the Calculus of variations we can find  uk∈H1  such that see Lemma [formula]. Moreover using the Lagrange multiplier rule we have that  (uk)k satisfies the equation:

[formula]

for some constants λk and γk.

Now it is easy to see that if there exists  α > 32π2 such that [formula] is bounded, then by using Lagrange formula, Young's inequality and Rellich compactness Theorem, we obtain that the weak limit of uk becomes an extremizer. On the other hand if is bounded, then from standard elliptic regularity theory  uk is compact, thus converges uniformly to an extremizer. Hence assuming that Theorem [formula]  does not hold, we get 1) 2) We will follow the same method as in [\cite=ly1] up to some extents.

In [\cite=ly1], the function sequence we studied is the following: where [formula], and uk attains [formula]. We also assumed ck  →    +    ∞  . Then we have

[formula]

for suitable choices of rk, xk. Next we proved the following

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

and that ckuk converges to some Green function weakly. In the end, we got an upper bound of [formula] via capacity.

([\ref=l1]) was first discovered by Struwe in [\cite=St].

([\ref=l2]) also appeared in [\cite=ao].

However there are two main differences between the present case and the one in [\cite=ly1]. One is that there is no direct maximum principle for equation ([formula]) and the other one is that truncations are not allowed in the space  H2(M) . Hence to get a counterpart of ([\ref=l1]) and ([formula]) is not easy.

To solve the first difficulty, we replace ck(uk(xk + rkx) - ck) with βk(uk(expxk(rkx)) - ck), where

[formula]

By using the strength of the Green representation formula, we get that the profile of  uk is either a constant function or a standard bubble. The second difficulty will be solved by applying capacity and Pohozaev type identity. In more detail we will prove that [formula] (see Lemma [formula]) which satisfies for some τ∈(0,1]. Then we can derive from a Pohozaev type identity (see Lemma [formula]) that In order to apply the capacity, we will follow some ideas in [\cite=Li-Li-Liu]. Concretely, we will show that up to a small term the energy of  uk on some annulus is bounded below by the Euclidean one (see Lemma [formula]). Moreover one can prove the existence of  Uk (see Lemma [formula])  such that the energy of  Uk is comparable to the Euclidean energy of  uk , and the Dirichlet datum and Neumann datum of  Uk  at the boundary of the annulus are also comparable to those of uk. In this sense, we simplify the calculation of capacity in [\cite=ly2]. Now using capacity techniques we get  [formula] and  dτ = 1, see Proposition [formula]. Furthermore we have that Hence we arrive to

[formula]

In the end, we will find test functions in order to contradict [formula]. We will simplify the arguments in [\cite=ly1]. Indeed we use carefully the regular part of  G to avoid cut-off functions and hence making the calculations simpler.

The plan of the paper is the following: In Section 2 we collect some preliminary results regarding the existence of the Green functions for  Δ2g  and  P4g , and associated Moser-Trudinger type inequality. In Section 2 we prove Theorem [formula]. This Section is divided into six subsections. In the first one, we deal with concentration behavior and the profile of the blowing-up sequence. The second one is concerned about the derivation of a Pohozaev type identity and its application. In subsection 3 we perform the Blow-up analysis to get either the zero function or a standard bubble in the limit. In the subsection 4, we deal with the capacity estimates to get an upper bound. And in the subsection 5, we construct test functions . In the last subsection we show how to reach a contradiction. The last Section is concerned about the sketch of the proof of Theorem [formula].

Notations and Preliminaries

In this brief section we collect some useful notations, and state a lemma giving the existence of the Green functions of  Δ2g and of the operator  P4g  with the asymptotics near the singularity. We also give a version of Adams inequality on the a manifold due to Fontana and an analogue of the well-known Moser-Trudinger inequality for the operator  P4g when it is non-negative.

We also denote with  dg(x,y)  the metric distance between two points  x and  y  of  M.

Δ0 stands for the Euclidean Laplacian and  Δg the Laplace-Beltrami with respect to the background metric  g.

As mentioned before we begin by stating a lemma giving the existence of the Green function of  Δ2g and P4g, and their asymptotics near the singularities.

We have that the Green function  F(x,y) of  Δ2g  exists in the following sense : a) For all functions  u∈C2(M), we have b) is smooth on  [formula], K extends to a  C1 + α function on  M2  and where,  r = dg(x,y) is the geodesic distance from  x to  y; f(r) is a  C∞ positive decreasing function, f(r) = 1 in a neighborhood of  r = 0 and f(r) = 0 for r  ≥  injg(M). Moreover we have that the following estimates holds

For the proof see [\cite=cy] and the proof of Lemma 2.3 in [\cite=mal].

Suppose  [formula]. Then the Green function  Q(x,y) of  P4g  exists in the following sense : a) For all functions  u∈C2(M), we have b) is smooth on  [formula], K extends to a  C2 + α function on  M2  and where,  r = dg(x,y) is the geodesic distance from  x to  y; f(r) is a  C∞ positive decreasing function, f(r) = 1 in a neighborhood of  r = 0 and f(r) = 0 for r  ≥  injg(M).

For the proof see Lemma 2.1 in [\cite=nd].

Next we state a Theorem due to Fontana[\cite=fl]. Next we state a Moser-Trudinger type inequality corresponding to  P4g when it is non-negative. The proof can be found in [\cite=nd] where it is proven for every  Png  (where  Png stands for higher order Paneitz operator).

Suppose that  P4g is non-negative and that  [formula], then there exists a constant  C = C(M) > 0 such that

Proof of Theorem [formula]

Let  αk be an increasing sequence converging to  32π2. Then for every  k  there exists  uk∈H1  such that Moreover  uk satisfies the following equation

[formula]

where and Moreover we have  uk∈C∞(M).

First of all using the inequality in Theorem [formula], one can check easily that the functional is weakly continous. Hence using Direct Methods of the Calculus of Variations we get the existence of maximizer say  uk. On the other hand using the Lagrange multiplier rule one get the equation ([\ref=eq:edp]). Moreover integrating the equation ([\ref=eq:edp]) and after multipling it by  uk and integrating again, we get the value of  γk and  λk  respectively. Moreover using standard elliptic regularity we get that  uk∈C∞(M). Hence the Lemma is proved.

Now we are ready to give the proof of Theorem [formula]. >From now on we suppose by contradiction that Theorem [formula] does not hold. Hence from the same considerations as in the Introduction we have that : 1)

[formula]

2) We will divide the reminder of the proof into six subsections.

Concentration behavior and profile of uk

This subsection is concerned about two main ingredients. The first one is the study of the concentration phenomenon of the energy corresponding to uk. The second one is the description of the profile of  βkuk  as  k  →    +    ∞  , where  βk is given by the relation We start by giving an energy concentration lemma which is inspired from P.L.Lions'work.

uk verifies : and for some  x0∈M.

First of all from the fact that  uk∈H1  we can assume without loss of generality that

[formula]

Now let us show that  u0 = 0. We have the trivial identity Hence using the fact that  [formula]  we derive So using  ([\ref=uk])  we get Now suppose that  u0  ≠  0  and let us argue for a contradiction. Then there exists some  β < 1 such that for  k large enough the following holds Hence using Fontana's result see Theorem [formula] we obtain that Now using Cauchy inequality one can check easily that Hence reaching a contradiction to [formula]. On the other hand without lost of generality we can assume that Now suppose  μ  ≠  δp for every  p∈M and let us argue for a contradiction to  [formula]  again. First of all let us take a cut-off function  η∈C∞0(Bδ(x)) , η = 1 on  [formula]  where  x is a fixed point in  M  and  δ  a fixed positive and small number. We have that Now working in a normal coordinate system around  x and using standard elliptic regularity theory we get where  [formula] is the point corresponding to  x  in  [formula]  and  [formula]  the expression of ηuk on the normal coordinate system. Hence for  δ  small we get Thus using the Adams result see [\cite=adr] we have that Hence using a covering argument we infer that so reaching a contradiction. Hence the Lemma is proved.

We have the following hold:

Let  N > 0 be large enougth. By using the definition of  λk we have that On the other hand Hence using the fact that we have that 1) holds. Now we prove 2). using the definition of  γk , we get Hence by using point 1 and letting  k  →    +    ∞   and after  N  →    +    ∞   we get point 2. So the Lemma is proved.

Next let us set One can check easily the following

With the definition above we have that 0  ≤  βk  ≤  ck,  |τk|  ≤  1 and  βkγk is bounded. Moreover up to a subsequence and up to changing  uk to  - uk

The next Lemma gives some Lebesgue estimates on Ball in terms of the radius with constant independent of the ball. As a corollary we get the profile of  βkuk as   k  →    +    ∞  .

There are constants C1(p),and  C2(p)  depending only on  p  and  M  such that, for r sufficiently small and for any x∈M there holds and where, respectively, p < 2, and p < 4.

First of all using the Green representation formula we have Hence using the equation we get Now by differentiating with respect to  x for every  m = 1,2 we have that Hence we get Taking the  p-th power in both side of the inequality and using the basic inequality we obtain Now integrating both sides of the inequality we obtain First let us estimate the second term in the right hand side of the inequality Thanks to the fact that  βkγk is bounded, to the asymptotics of the Green function and to Jensen's inequality. Now let us estimates the second term. First of all we define the following auxiliary measure We have that  mk is a probability measure. On the other hand we can write

[formula]

Now by using Jensen's inequality we have that Thus with the ([\ref=jen1]) we have that Now by using again the same argument as in the first term we obtain Hence the Lemma is proved.

Next we give a corollary of this Lemma.

We have  [formula]  W2,p(M)  for  p∈(1,2),  [formula] smoothly in  [formula]  where  δ is small and  G satisfies Moreover with  r = dg(x,x0). S = S0 + S1(x) , S0 = S(x0) and  S∈W2,q(M) for every  q  ≥  1.

By Lemma [formula]  we have that On the other hand using Lemma [formula]  we get eαku2k is bounded in  [formula]. Hence the standard elliptic regularity implies that

[formula]

So to end the proof of the proposition we need only to show that

[formula]

To do this let us take  φ∈C∞(M)  then we have Using ([\ref=bu]) we have that On the other hand, we can write inside the ball  Bδ(x0) Now using again  ()  we derive Hence we arrive to Thus we get Hence from Lemma [formula]  we conclude the proof of claim ([\ref=claim]) )and of the Corollary too.

Pohozaev type identity and application

As it is already said in the introduction this subsection deals with the derivation of a Pohozaev type identity. And as corollary we give the limit of  [formula] in terms of  Volg(M), λk, βk  and  τ

Setting   Uk  =  Δguk we have the following holds where δ is small and fixed real number.

The proof relies on the divergence formula and the asymptotics of the metric g in normal coordinates around  xk. By the definition of  Uk we have that

The first issue is to compute   [formula]  in two different ways, where r(x) = dg(x,xk). On one side we obtain

[formula]

On the other side we get

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

In the same way we obtain

[formula]

Hence by summing this two last lines we arrive to

[formula]

On the other hand using the same method one can check easily that

[formula]

and

[formula]

So using [formula],[formula] and  [formula] we arrive to

[formula]

Thus the Lemma is proved

We have that Moreover we have that

First of all we have that the sequence  [formula] is bounded. Indeed using the definition of  βk we have that Hence using Jensen's inequality we obtain Thus using the definition of  λk we have that On the other hand one can check easily that Hence we derive that  [formula] is bounded. So we can suppose without lost of generality that  [formula] converges. Now from Lemma [\ref=eq:P] we have that So using Lemma [\ref=eq:profile] we obtain Moreover by trivial calculations we get and Hence with this we obtain On the other hand we have that Moreover by Lemma [formula]  we have that Thus we derive that Hence letting  δ  →  0 we obtain Now suppose  τ = 0 then we get On the other hand we have that hence a contradiction. Thus  τ  ≠  0 and the Corollary is proved.

Blow-up analysis

In this subsection we perform the Blow-up analysis and show that the asymptotic profile of  uk is either the zero function or a standard Bubble. First of all let us introduce some notations. We set Now for  x∈Br- 1kδ(0) with  δ > 0 small we set Next we define

The following hold: We have and

First of all we recall that Since  [formula], [formula] are bounded and  ck  →    +    ∞   , then we infer that Now using the Green representation formula for  Δ2g (see Lemma  [formula]) we have that Now using equation and differentiating with respect to  x  we obtain that for  m = 1,2  Hence from the fact that  βkγk is bounded see Lemma  [formula]  we get Now for  yk∈BLrk(xk),  L > 0 fixed we write that thanks to the fact that  |uk|  ≤  ck to the definition of  rk. Now it is not worth remarking that  ck = uk(xk) since we have taken  τ  ≥  0  (see Lemma [formula]). Hence we have that So we get from the estimate above that  wk is uniformly bounded in  C2(K) for every compact subset  K of  [formula]. Thus by Arzéla-Ascoli Theorem we infer that Clearly  w is a Lipschitz function since the constant which bounds the gradient of  wk is independent of the compact set  K. On the other hand from the Green representation formula we have for  [formula]  fixed and for  L big enough such that  x∈BL(0)  Now remarking that we have that Hence using  [formula] we obtain Now setting and we find So using the definition of  wk we arrive to Now to continue the proof we consider two cases: Case 1: d <  +   ∞

First of all let us study each of the terms  2αkβkIk(x), [formula], [formula] separately. Using the change of variables  y = expxk(rkz) we have Hence using the definition of  rk  and  vk  one can check easily that the following holds Moreover from the asymptotics of the Green function see Lemma [formula]  we have that where Hence since  K is of class  C1  on  M2 and  gk  →  dx2 in  [formula] and  vk  →  1 then letting  k  →    +    ∞    we derive Now to estimate [formula]  we write for  k large enough where Taking the absolute value in both sides of the equality and using the change of variable  y = expxk(rkz)  and the fact that  K∈C1  we obtain, Hence letting  k  →    +    ∞   we deduce that Now using the same method one proves that So we have that Hence letting  L  →    +    ∞   we obtain that  w  is a solution of the following integral equation

[formula]

Now since w is Lipschitz then the theory of singular integral operator gives that  [formula]. Since and then we get Now setting we have that  w̃ satisfies the following conformally invariant integral equation

[formula]

and Hence from the classification result by X.Xu see Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=xu] we derive that for some  λ > 0 and  [formula]. >From the fact that we obtain Then we derive Hence by trivial calculations we get Case 2:  d =  +   ∞  . In this case using the same argument we get and Now let us show that By using the same arguments as in Case 1 we get Now since  K is  C1  we need only to show that By using the trivial inequality and the change of variables as above, we obtain On the other hand using the property of  vk one can check easily that Thus we arrive to So we get Thus letting  k  →    +    ∞  , we obtain Hence the Proposition is proved.

Capacity estimates

This subsection deals with some capacity-type estimates which allow us to get an upper bound of  [formula]. We start by giving a first Lemma to show that we can basically work on Euclidean space in order to get the capacity estimates as already said in the Introduction.

There is a constant  B  which is independent of k, L and δ  s.t. where Moreover we have that

First of all by using the definition of  Δg ie we get On the other hand using the fact that (see Corollary [formula])) where  p∈(1,2); and  (x) = G(expx0(x)); we obtain and it is clear that Now let us estimate [formula]. To do this, we first write the inverse of the metric in the following form with We can write Furthermore we derive On the other hand we have that So setting We obtain Moreover we have that Hence we get with On the other hand using similar arguments we get with So we arrive to with Hence we can find a constant  B1 independent of  k, L and δ s.t So setting we have the proved the Lemma.

Next we give a technical Lemma

There exists a sequence of functions   [formula]  s.t and Moreover there holds

First of all let us set and   uk'  to be the solution of Next let us define Clearly we have that Now let  η be a smooth function which satisfies and set Then we have that where  S̃1(x) = S1(expx0(x)) . Furthermore we obtain then where So we get Hence setting we have proved the Lemma.

We have the following holds and

First using Lemma [\ref=eq:capeu] and Lemma [\ref=eq:] we get

[formula]

with Next we will apply capacity to give a lower boundary of  [formula]. Hence we need to calculate

[formula]

where P1, P2, Q1, Q2 are constants. It is obvious that the infimum is attained by the function  Φ  which satisfies Moreover we can require the function Φ to be of the form where  A, B,  C,  D  are all constants which satisfies the following linear system of equations Now by straightforward calculations we obtain the explicit expression of  A and  B  Where [formula]. Furthermore we have

[formula]

In our case in which we have that Then by the formula giving  A we obtain by trivial calculations where Moreover using the the fact that the sequence [formula] is bounded it is easily seen that Furthermore using the formula of  B we get still by trivial calculations and then Now let compute 8π2A2 log r / R. By using the expression of  A, r  and  R , we have that Now using the relation we derive On the other hand using Taylor expansion we have the following identity hence we get

On the other hand using the relation we obtain Moreover using again the trivial relation we arrive to On the other hand one can check easily that the following holds thus we obtain Furthermore using the relation we get

[formula]

Next we will evaluate [formula]. We have that by Green formula Thus using the equation solved by  G we get Hence we obtain Now let us set Hence using ([\ref=cap1]), ([\ref=cap2]), ([\ref=cap3]), we derive that Moreover by isolating the term  [formula]  in the left and transposing all the other in the right we get

[formula]

Hence using the trivial identity we get Now suppose  d =  +   ∞  , letting δ  →  0, then we have that thus we derive Hence using Corollary [\ref=eq:sup] we obtain a contradiction. So  d must be finite. On the other hand one can check easily that the following holds Hence we derive otherwise we reach the same contradiction. So we have that Hence by using this we can rewrite  B as follows Thus we obtain On the other hand since  d <  +   ∞  , we have that by Lemma [\ref=bubble] Moreover by trivial calculations we get Furthermore by taking the limit as  k  →    +    ∞   in ([\ref=llbc]) we obtain Now letting L  →    +    ∞  , we get Hence by remarking the trivial identity we get So the proof of the proposition is done.

The test function

This Subsection deals with the construction of some test functions in order to reach a contradiction. Now let  ε > 0, c > 0, L > 0 and set

[formula]

where and

[formula]

We have that for  ε small, there exist suitable  c and  L such that and

First of all using the expansion of  g in normal coordinates we get where On the other hand by direct calculations owe obtain Hence we arrive to Furthermore, by direct computation, we have Moreover using Green formula we get

[formula]

Now let us find a condition to have   [formula]. By trivial calculations we can see that it is equivalent to i.e. Hence by ([\ref=Lambda])  Λ take the following form On the other hand it is easily seen that and hence Furthermore by trivial calculations one gets that in  BLε(x0)

[formula]

hence

[formula]

on the other hand

[formula]

Thus we arrive to and factorizing by  [formula] we get On the other hand setting we get Hence the Proposition is proved.

Proof of Theorem [formula]

This small subsection is concerned about the proof of Theorem [formula]. First of all by corollary we have that with  τ  ≠  0. On the other hand from Proposition [formula]  we get Hence we obtain Thus using the relation we derive On the other hand from Proposition [formula]  we have the existence of a family of function  fε such that and Hence we reach a contradiction. So the proof of Theorem [formula] is completed.

Proof of Theorem [formula]

As already said in the Introduction, in this brief Section we will explain how the proof of Theorem [formula] remains valid for Theorem [formula]. First of all we remark that all the analysis above have been possible due to the following facts 1)  [formula] is an equivalent norm to the standard norm of  H2(M) on  H1. 2) The existence of the Green function for  Δ2g. 3) The result of Fontana. On the other hand we have a counterpart of 2) and 3). Moreover it is easy to see that  [formula] is also an equivalent norm to the standard norm of  H2(M)  on  H2. Notice that for a blowing-up sequence  uk  we have that

[formula]

then it is easy to see that the same proof is valid up to the subsection of test functions. Notice that  [formula] holds for the test functions  fε , then it is easy to see that continuing the same proof we get Theorem [formula].
