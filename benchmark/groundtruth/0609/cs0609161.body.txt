The Order Bound on the Minimum Distance of the One-Point Codes Associated to a Garcia-Stichtenoth Tower of Function Fields

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the set of all non-negative integers. A numerical semigroup is a subset Λ of [formula] containing 0, closed under summation and with finite complement in [formula]. The enumeration of Λ is the unique increasing bijective map [formula]. Usually λi is used instead of λ(i). Given a numerical semigroup Λ with enumeration λ define the sequence νi by

[formula]

This sequence has become of great importance in the theory of one-point algebraic-geometry codes. For a sequence of one-point codes on a curve, where the one point is P, the numerical semigroup considered is that of the pole orders in P of functions having only poles in P, usually named as the Weierstrass semigroup of P. The sequence νi is used to define the order bound on the minimum distance of one-point algebraic-geometry codes:

[formula]

The order bound, also known as Feng-Rao bound, is a lower bound on the minimum distance of the i-th one-point code on P. In this case the numerical semigroup is the Weierstrass semigroup associated to P. Details can be found in [\cite=FeRa:dFR] [\cite=HoLiPe:agc] [\cite=KiPe:telescopic].

Garcia and Stichtenoth first gave in [\cite=GaSt:attainingDV] [\cite=GaSt:tff] two towers of function fields attaining the Drinfeld-Vl adu t bound, which became of great importance in the area of algebraic coding theory. The tower in [\cite=GaSt:tff] is defined over the finite field with q2 elements [formula] for q a prime power. It is given by

[formula]

Fm  =  Fm - 1(xm) with xm satisfying

[formula]

It is shown in [\cite=GaSt:tff] that the number of its rational points is [formula] and that the genus gm of Fm is [formula] Hence, the ratio between the genus g(Fm) and Nq2(Fm) converges to 1 / (q - 1), the Drinfeld-Vl adu t bound, as m increases. From these curves one can construct asymptotically good sequences of codes.

For every function field Fm in the tower we distinguish the rational point Qm that is the unique pole of x1. The Weierstrass semigroup Λm at Qm in Fm was recursively described in [\cite=PeStTo]. Indeed, the semigroups are given recursively by

[formula]

Although these Weierstrass semigroups have been known for a long time, no explicit description of the order bound on the minimum distance for the associated one-point codes has appeared in the literature. Chen found certain bounds on the order bound for a given range and this enabled him to prove that some codes had distance larger than the order bound [\cite=Chen]. The main goal of this paper is to find the explicit description of the order bound from a deep analysis of these semigroups.

In Section [\ref=sec:gs2-semigroup] we give a non-recursive description of these semigroups. This description leads to explicit formulation of their enumerations as well as for the inverses of their enumerations. This is presented in Section [\ref=sec:gs2-enumeration]. In Section [\ref=sec:obound] we find the explicit formula for the order bound on the minimum distance of the one-point codes associated to the tower of function fields.

Non-recursive description of the semigroups

In this section we will give a non-recursive description of the semigroups ([\ref=eq:semigroups]). The conductor of a numerical semigroup Λ is the unique integer c such that [formula] and [formula]. The gaps of Λ are the elements in [formula] and the non-gaps are the elements in Λ.

From now on we will use cm for the conductor of Λm, which is [formula], and [formula]. Notice that these are not recursive definitions.

[formula]

We will proceed by induction. The case m = 1 is obvious. Suppose m > 1. If m is even, say m = 2n, then

[formula]

By the induction hypothesis, since c2n - 1 = q2n - 1 - qn and c2n = q2n - qn,

[formula]

If m is odd, say m = 2n + 1, then

[formula]

By the induction hypothesis, since c2n = q2n - qn and c2n + 1 = q2n + 1 - qn + 1,

[formula]

It remains to see that the unions are disjoint. Let us first see that the sets qm - 2i + 1Ai are pairwise disjoint. Indeed,

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

This proves that the sets qm - (2i - 1)Ai are pairwise disjoint.

Now, the maximum attained by these sets is [formula]. If m is even then this equals [formula] while if m is odd then this equals [formula]

Enumeration of the semigroups

In this section we use the notations and results in Theorem [\ref=theorem:gs2-semigroup] to find an explicit formula for the enumeration of the semigroups in ([\ref=eq:semigroups]) as well as a formula for its inverse.

Let λ be the enumeration of Λm.

The conductor cm is the image by λ of [formula]. That is, [formula].

If [formula], then [formula]

If [formula], then λt = qm - 2l - 1(c2l + 1 + t + 1 - ql), where l = ⌊ log q(t + 1)⌋.

For any positive integer i it holds [formula] and hence

[formula]

Since cm is the first non-gap which is not in [formula], [formula].

If [formula], then λt is in the subset [formula] and for all λk in this subset we have, [formula] Taking [formula] and [formula] we get [formula]

If [formula], then the lemma below shows that t may be uniquely expressed as t = ql - 1  +  j - 1 where [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], we have λql - 1 - 1 is the first non-gap which is not in [formula], namely qm - 2l + 1c2l - 1. The next non-gaps after qm - 2l + 1c2l - 1 are qm - 2l + 1(c2l - 1  +  i) with [formula]. Therefore, λt  =  qm - 2l + 1(c2l - 1 + j)  =  qm - 2l + 1(c2l - 1 + t + 1  -  ql).

Any nonnegative integer t may be uniquely expressed in the form

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore, l = ⌊ log q(t + 1)⌋ and j  =  t  -  ql - 1 + 1.

Observe that

[formula]

Setting j = t - ql - 1 + 1 shows that t may be expressed as claimed, and that the choice of l and j are unique.

We want to find now a formula for the inverse of the enumeration of a numerical semigroup. Given an integer k and a numerical semigroup Λ we define the semigroup floor of k with respect to Λ as the largest element in Λ which is not larger than k. It is denoted ⌊k⌋Λ. In the next theorem we describe a formula not only to find the inverse of the enumeration of a numerical semigroup, but also to find the index for the semigroup floor of any integer.

Let λ be the enumeration of Λm and let [formula] be an integer. Let ci and gi be respectively the conductor and the genus of Λi. Then,

[formula]

where l = m + 1 - ⌈ log q(qm - k)⌉.

The result for the case when [formula] is obvious. Suppose k < cm. By Theorem [\ref=theorem:gs2-semigroup], ⌊k⌋Λm can be expressed as qm - 2l + 1(c2l - 1  +  i) with [formula] and with l being the largest integer l with [formula]. Notice that it is also the largest integer l with [formula]. By substituting c2l - 1 by q2l - 1 - ql one gets l = m + 1 - ⌈ log q(qm - k)⌉. By Theorem [\ref=theorem:gs2-enumeration]. 3), it follows that [formula]. Now, [formula] is a consequence of the fact that ⌊k⌋Λm belongs to qm - 2l + 1Al.

The Order Bound on the Minimum Distance

From now on, λm denotes the enumeration of Λm, cm,gm are the conductor and the genus of Λm, νmi is the ith value of the ν-sequence corresponding to the semigroup Λm and δmi is the order bound on the minimum distance of the ith one point code associated to Fm.

ν1i = i + 1 for all i. If i > 1 then

[formula]

Notice that [formula] implies that an element in Λm is a multiple of q if and only if it is in qΛm - 1.

The case [formula] is equivalent to [formula]. From the inductive definition of Λm it is clear that λmi  =  qλm - 1i and consequently, νmi  =  νm - 1i.

The case [formula] is equivalent to [formula]. It is well known that for any semigroup Λ with conductor c and genus g the sequence ν satisfies that νi = i - g + 1 for all [formula].

We are left with the case [formula]. Suppose λmi  =  λmj  +  λmk with [formula]. Then λmj  <  cm so λmj∈qΛm - 1. If q|λmi then also q|λmk, so λmk∈qΛm - 1. This shows that we have a one-to-one correspondence between [formula] and [formula], where qλm - 1i'  =  λmi, that is, i' = (i + gm) / q - gm - 1. Thus νmi  =  νm - 1i'.

If [formula] then also [formula]. Consequently, λmk  >  cm and λmj  <  λmi - cm. One can see that each λmj∈Λm with λmj  <  λmi - cm yields a pair of elements in [formula]. Thus [formula].

The order bound on the minimum distance satisfies

[formula]

Notice that by Lemma [\ref=lemma:nu], νmcm - gm + 1 = 2 for all m. Thus, if [formula] then δmi = 2.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:nu], νm is increasing in the subset [formula] Now it is enough to check that for i such that [formula] and q|i + 1 + gm, [formula]. To see this we will show that [formula]. Indeed, since q|i + 1 + gm, [formula]. So, λmi + 2  =  λmj  +  λmk with [formula] is only possible if λmj  <  cm and λmk  >  cm. In this case, λmi + 1  =  λmi + 2 - 1 = λmj  +  λmk - 1 = λmj  +  λmk - 1.

The order bound on the minimum distance is

[formula]

The cases [formula] and i > 2cm - gm - 2 follow directly from Lemma [\ref=lemma:obound] and Lemma [\ref=lemma:nu].

Suppose [formula]. We will show that [formula], where l = m + 1 - ⌈ log q(qm - i - 1 + cm - gm)⌉. Substituting l  =  m + 1 - α with α as defined above gives the desired result.

If q|i + 1 + gm, then

[formula]

where l = m + 1 - ⌈ log q(qm - i - 1 + cm - gm)⌉. Here we have used Lemma [\ref=lemma:obound], Lemma [\ref=lemma:nu], and Theorem [\ref=theorem:inverseenumeration].

For [formula],

[formula]

However, ⌊i + 1 + gm - cm⌋Λm  =  ⌊i + gm - cm⌋Λm since in this case i + 1 + gm - cm  <  cm and [formula]. Thus, we can use the same formula as above for δmi.
