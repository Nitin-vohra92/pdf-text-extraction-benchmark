Log homogeneous varieties

Introduction

Consider a complete nonsingular algebraic variety X over the field of complex numbers. If X is homogeneous, then its structure is well understood by a classical result of Borel and Remmert: X is the product of an abelian variety (the Albanese variety) and a flag variety (the basis of the "Tits fibration").

More generally, one would like to classify the almost homogeneous varieties X, i.e., those where a connected algebraic group G acts with an open orbit X0. However, this central problem of equivariant geometry seems to be too general, and complete results are only known under assumptions of smallness (in various senses) for the boundary [formula]. We refer to [\cite=HO84] for an exposition of such classification results, in the setting of holomorphic actions on complex analytic spaces.

In another direction, there is a well-developed structure theory for certain classes of almost homogeneous varieties, where the acting group and the open orbit are prescribed: torus embeddings, spherical embeddings and, more generally, equivariant embeddings of a homogeneous space X0 under a reductive group G (see the recent survey [\cite=Ti06]). A subclass of special interest is that of G-regular varieties in the sense of [\cite=BDP90]; in loose words, their orbit structure is that of a nonsingular toric variety. Another important subclass consists of semiabelic varieties; in loose words again, they are toric bundles over abelian varieties. (Semiabelic varieties are introduced in [\cite=Al02], where their role in degenerations of abelian varieties is investigated.)

These restrictive assumptions on G and X0 are convenient in the setting of algebraic transformation groups, but somewhat unnatural from a geometric viewpoint. This motivates the search for a class of almost homogeneous varieties containing all regular varieties under a reductive group and all semiabelic varieties, having geometric significance and an accessible structure. Also, it is natural to impose that the boundary be a divisor with normal crossings.

In the present paper, we introduce the class of log homogeneous varieties and show that it fulfills the above requirements. Given a normal crossings divisor D in X, we say that X is log homogeneous with boundary D if the associated logarithmic tangent bundle TX( -  log D) is generated by its global sections. It follows readily that X is almost homogeneous under the connected automorphism group [formula], with boundary being D. More generally, the G-orbits in X are exactly the strata defined by D (Prop. [\ref=prop:crit]); in particular, their number is finite.

All G-regular varieties are log homogeneous, as shown in [\cite=BB96]. Semiabelic varieties satisfy a stronger property, namely, the bundle TX( -  log D) is trivial; we then say that X is log parallelizable with boundary D. Conversely, log parallelizable varieties are semiabelic by a theorem of Winkelmann [\cite=Wi04] which has been the starting point for our investigations. The class of log homogeneous varieties turns out to be stable under several natural operations: induction (Prop. [\ref=prop:Gf]), equivariant blow-ups (Prop. [\ref=prop:mor]), étale covers (Prop. [\ref=prop:ec]) and taking invariant subvarieties or irreducible components of fibers of morphisms (Cor. [\ref=cor:lhr]).

Any log homogeneous variety X comes with two natural morphisms which turn out to play opposite roles. The first one is the Albanese map α:X  →  A(X); in our algebraic setting, this is the universal map to an abelian variety. We show that α is a fibration with fibers being log homogeneous under the maximal connected affine subgroup [formula] of G, and spherical under any Levi subgroup of [formula]; this yields our main structure theorem (Thm. [\ref=thm:str]).

The second morphism is the Tits map τ to a Grassmannian, defined by the global sections of the logarithmic tangent bundle. Let σ:X  →  S(X) be the Stein factorization of τ, so that σ is the morphism associated with the globally generated divisor -  KX  -  D (the determinant of TX(  -   log D)). We show that S(X) is also a spherical variety under any Levi subgroup of [formula], and the irreducible components of fibers of σ are semiabelic varieties (Prop. [\ref=prop:sf]). It follows that the product morphism α  ×  σ is surjective with fibers being finite unions of toric varieties (Thm. [\ref=thm:atm]). This generalizes the Borel-Remmert theorem; note, however, that S(X) may be singular, see Remark [\ref=rem:fin](ii).

Actually, these results hold in a slightly more general setting, namely, for a faithful action of a connected algebraic group G on X preserving a normal crossings divisor D and such that the associated global vector fields generate TX( -  log D). Then G has the same orbits as the full group [formula], but may well be strictly contained in that group. For example, let X be the projective n-space and D the union of m hyperplanes in general position. If m  ≤  n, then X is log homogeneous with boundary D under the action of [formula]. If, in addition, n  -  m is odd and at least 3, then X is still log homogeneous with boundary D for a smaller group G, namely, the largest subgroup of [formula] that acts on the intersection of the m hyperplanes as the projective symplectic group.

This article is organized as follows. Section 1 contains a number of useful preliminary results on algebraic groups and their homogeneous spaces, that we did not see explicitly stated in the literature. We discuss algebraic analogues of the Albanese and Tits fibrations, which are classical tools in the theory of complex homogeneous manifolds. In our algebraic setting, the Borel-Remmert theorem admits a very short proof (Theorem [\ref=thm:br]).

In Section 2, we consider nonsingular almost homogeneous varieties, possibly not complete. We obtain a criterion for log homogeneity resp. parallelizability, as well as stability properties and simple local models. We also show that the Albanese map is a fibration; this yields an important reduction to the case where the acting group is affine. Finally, we obtain an algebraic version of Winkelmann's theorem, again with a very short proof (Theorem [\ref=thm:lpt]).

The final Section 3 is devoted to complete log homogeneous varieties. After some preliminary lemmas about their relations to spherical varieties, we describe their structure and analyze the Tits map and its Stein factorization σ. We also show that the group of equivariant automorphisms is an extension of the Albanese variety by a diagonalizable group, so that its connected component is a semiabelian variety, acting on the general fibers of σ with an open orbit (Props. [\ref=prop:ea] and [\ref=prop:cc]). In fact, the relative logarithmic tangent bundle of σ is trivial, with fiber being the Lie algebra of the equivariant automorphism group (Prop. [\ref=prop:sf]). Finally, we introduce the subclass of strongly log homogeneous varieties, closely related to regular varieties under a reductive group. We obtain a simple characterization of this subclass (Prop. [\ref=prop:slh]) and we apply it to the classification of complete log homogeneous surfaces (Prop. [\ref=prop:cs]).

Our arguments are purely algebraic; they involve results of the theory of algebraic transformation groups, and some basic notions borrowed from logarithmic birational geometry (for which we refer to [\cite=Ma02]) and holomorphic transformation groups (see [\cite=Ak95] [\cite=HO84]). Our results represent only the first steps in the understanding of log homogeneous varieties. They raise many open problems, among which the most important ones seem to be:

A) Characterize those homogeneous spaces that admit a log homogeneous completion.

B) Classify the triples (L,Y,N), where L is a connected reductive group, Y is a complete nonsingular spherical L-variety, and N is a unipotent group of automorphisms of Y, normalized by L and such that Y is log homogeneous under the semidirect product LN.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:str], Problem A may be reduced to homogeneous spaces X0 under an affine group G, and then a necessary condition is that X0 be spherical under a Levi subgroup of G. We do not know if this condition is not sufficient.

Problem B is equivalent to the classification of complete log homogeneous varieties, by Theorem [\ref=thm:str] again. It fits into the problem of describing automorphism groups of complete nonsingular spherical varieties, which is very much open in general (see [\cite=Od88] for the toric case, and [\cite=Br06] for the regular case).

Another natural question concerns the case where the field of complex numbers is replaced with an algebraically closed field of positive characteristics. Here a number of results carry over with only small changes, but the Borel-Remmert theorem requires strong additional assumptions of separability. Also, some important ingredients of Section 3 (the existence of a Levi decomposition, the local structure of spherical varieties, Knop's vanishing theorem for the logarithmic tangent sheaf) are not available in this setting.

Notation and conventions. Throughout this article, we consider algebraic varieties and algebraic groups over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero. By a variety, we mean an integral separated scheme of finite type over k, and by an algebraic group, a group scheme of finite type over k. Morphisms are understood to be morphisms of varieties over k; points are understood to be k-rational. As a general reference for algebraic geometry, we use the book [\cite=Ha77], and [\cite=DG70] for algebraic groups.

Any algebraic group G is nonsingular, since k has char. 0. Thus, the neutral component G0, that is, the connected component of G containing the identity element, is a nonsingular variety. Also, recall that being affine or linear are equivalent properties of G (or G0). But we shall consider algebraic groups that are not necessarily affine, e.g., abelian varieties for which we refer to the expository article [\cite=Mi86].

Homogeneous varieties

Algebraic groups

Let G be a connected algebraic group. By a result of Chevalley (see [\cite=Co02] for a modern proof), there exists a unique closed connected normal affine subgroup [formula] such that the quotient group [formula] is an abelian variety. We denote by

[formula]

the quotient morphism.

Recall also that any morphism from a connected affine algebraic group to an abelian variety is constant, see [\cite=Mi86]. It follows that [formula] contains every closed connected affine subgroup of G. Moreover, every morphism (of varieties) f:G  →  A, where A is an abelian variety, factors uniquely as [formula], where φ:A(G)  →  A is a morphism. By [\cite=Mi86], φ is the composition of a translation and a group homomorphism. So α is the Albanese morphism of the variety G, as defined in [\cite=Se58]. In particular, A(G) depends only on G regarded as a variety.

We record the following easy result, where we denote the center of G by C(G), or simply by C if this yields no confusion. Also, recall that an isogeny is a surjective homomorphism of algebraic groups, with finite kernel.

The algebraic groups G / C and G / C0 are both affine, and

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] is the neutral component of both groups [formula] and [formula], and the natural map A(C0)  →  A(G) is an isogeny.

Via the adjoint representation of G in its Lie algebra [formula], the quotient group G / C is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of [formula]. In particular, G / C is affine.

The natural map G / C0  →  G / C is the quotient by the finite group C / C0, and hence is an affine morphism. Thus, G / C0 is affine as well.

Note that [formula] is a closed normal subgroup of G, and the corresponding quotient

[formula]

is affine. On the other hand, [formula] is a quotient of the abelian variety A(G), and hence is complete. This yields ([\ref=eqn:gz]).

The remaining assertions follow readily from the definitions.

The Albanese fibration

Let X be a G-variety and X0  ⊆  X a G-orbit. Choosing a base point x∈X0, we identify the homogeneous variety X0  =  G  ·  x with the homogeneous space G / H, where H denotes the isotropy group Gx.

Since [formula] is an abelian variety, the product

[formula]

is a closed normal subgroup of G, independent of the choice of the base point x, and the quotient G / I(X0) is an abelian variety as well. Moreover, the natural map

[formula]

is the Albanese morphism of X0. Note that α is a G-equivariant fibration with fiber

[formula]

and this [formula]-homogeneous variety is also independent of the choice of x.

Further properties of H and I(X0) are gathered in the following:

Let X be a variety on which G acts faithfully, and X0  =  G  ·  x  ⊆  X a G-orbit. Then the isotropy group H  =  Gx is affine; equivalently, [formula]. Moreover, there exists a finite subgroup F  ⊆  C0 such that

[formula]

Note that H acts on the local ring Ox and on its quotients [formula] by powers of the maximal ideal; these quotients are finite-dimensional k-vector spaces. Let Hn be the kernel of the resulting homomorphism [formula]. Then the Hn form a decreasing sequence of closed subgroups of H, and their intersection acts trivially on Ox. Since the G-action is faithful, this intersection is trivial, and hence so is Hn for n  ≫  0. Thus, the algebraic group H is affine.

As a consequence, [formula], and I(X0) is affine as well. Moreover,

[formula]

by ([\ref=eqn:gz]). Thus, [formula] is a commutative affine algebraic group: it is the direct product of a connected algebraic group (contained in [formula]) with a finite group.

The Tits fibration

Consider again a G-variety X. The tangent sheaf

[formula]

is a G-linearized sheaf on X, equipped with a G-equivariant map

[formula]

This yields a morphism of G-linearized sheaves

[formula]

Clearly, opX is surjective if and only if X is G-homogeneous. Under this assumption, the kernel of opX is a G-linearized locally free sheaf, and its fiber at any point x is the isotropy Lie subalgebra [formula]. Likewise, the fiber at x of the locally free G-linearized sheaf TX is the quotient [formula]. In particular, opX is an isomorphism if and only if X is the quotient of G by a finite subgroup; we then say that X is G-parallelizable.

If X is homogeneous under a faithful action of G, then [formula] is contained in the Lie algebra [formula] of [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:H]. So we obtain a morphism

[formula]

where L denotes the scheme of Lie subalgebras of [formula] (alternatively, we may consider the Grassmann variety of subspaces of [formula]). Clearly, τ is G-equivariant, where G acts on L via its adjoint action on [formula]; in particular, τ is invariant under C. Thus, the image of τ is a unique [formula]-orbit that we denote by L(X), and τ:X  →  L(X) is a G-equivariant fibration, called the Tits fibration.

Choosing a base point x∈X with isotropy group H, we obtain with obvious notation

[formula]

where the second isomorphism follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:G]. Thus, the fiber of τ at x is the homogeneous space [formula], quotient of the (not necessarily connected) algebraic group [formula] by the finite subgroup H / H0. In particular, all connected components of fibers are parallelizable varieties.

(i) The Tits fibration may be defined, more generally, for a homogeneous G-variety X on which the action is not necessarily faithful: just replace [formula] with [formula] (the isotropy Lie algebra of x in [formula]). But several statements take a much simpler form in the setting of faithful actions.

(ii) Unlike the Albanese fibration, the Tits fibration may depend on the G-action on X. Consider, for example, a connected affine group G regarded as a homogeneous G-variety under its action via left multiplication; then the Tits fibration is trivial. But this fibration is nontrivial if G is regarded as a homogeneous G  ×  G-variety under its action via left and right multiplication, and G is noncommutative.

(iii) The Tits fibration yields an exact sequence of G-linearized locally free sheaves on G / H

[formula]

where Tτ denotes the relative tangent sheaf. By taking fibers at the base point, this corresponds to an exact sequence of H-modules

[formula]

Note that H acts on [formula] via its finite quotient H / H0. Thus, the pull-back of Tτ under the finite cover G / H0  →  G / H is trivial.

(iv) Likewise, the Albanese fibration yields an exact sequence of G-linearized locally free sheaves

[formula]

corresponding to the exact sequence of H-modules

[formula]

Note that the H-module [formula] is trivial; this also follows from the triviality of the tangent sheaf of the abelian variety A(X).

The product fibration

We now consider the product map

[formula]

where [formula].

With the above notation, α  ×  τ is surjective; in particular, it is a G-equivariant fibration. Its fiber at the base point of G / H is the homogeneous space [formula], quotient of the affine algebraic group [formula] by the finite subgroup [formula].

In particular, the morphism α  ×  τ is affine, and the connected components of its fibers are parallelizable varieties.

Any fiber of α is a unique [formula]-orbit, and hence is mapped onto L(X) by τ. Thus, α  ×  τ is surjective. In particular, A(X)  ×  L(X) is a unique G-orbit. Since [formula] and [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Thus, the fiber of α  ×  τ equals [formula].

As in Remark [\ref=rem:tf](iii), the relative tangent sheaf of α  ×  τ corresponds to the H / H0-module [formula]. Thus, the pull-back of this sheaf under the finite cover G / H0  →  G / H is trivial.

The above lemma yields an algebraic version of the Borel-Remmert structure theorem for compact homogeneous Kähler manifolds, see e.g. [\cite=Ak95]:

For a complete homogeneous G-variety X, the map α  ×  τ is an isomorphism.

We may assume that G acts faithfully on X  =  G / H. Since the fiber of α is [formula], then [formula] is a parabolic subgroup of [formula]. In particular, [formula] is connected and equals its normalizer in [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

so that the morphism α  ×  τ is bijective by Lemma [\ref=lem:at]. Since A(X)  ×  L(X) is nonsingular, α  ×  τ is an isomorphism.

Log homogeneous varieties

Definitions and basic properties

Consider a pair (X,D), where X is a nonsingular variety and D  ⊂  X is a divisor with normal crossings. That is, D is an effective divisor and its local equation at an arbitrary point x∈X decomposes in the completed local ring x into a product [formula], where [formula] form part of a regular system of parameters [formula] of x. Let

[formula]

be the subsheaf consisting of those derivations that preserve the ideal sheaf OX( - D). One easily checks that the logarithmic tangent sheaf TX( -  log D) is a locally free sheaf of Lie subalgebras of TX, having the same restriction to [formula], and hence the same rank n  =   dim (X). The dual of TX( -  log D) is the sheaf Ω1X( log D) of logarithmic differential forms, that is, of differential 1-forms on [formula] having at most simple poles along D. The top exterior power [formula] is the invertible sheaf OX( - KX  -  D), where KX denotes the canonical divisor.

If D is defined at x by the equation [formula] as above, then a local basis of TX( -  log D) (after localization and completion at x) consists of

[formula]

where [formula] is the local basis of TX dual to the local basis [formula] of Ω1X.

Next, assume that a connected algebraic group G acts on X and preserves D; we say that (X,D) is a G-pair. Then the sheaf TX(  -   log D) is G-linearized and the map [formula] of ([\ref=eqn:OP]) factors through a map

[formula]

This defines a morphism of G-linearized sheaves

[formula]

We say that the pair (X,D) is homogeneous ( resp. parallelizable) under G, if opX,D is surjective (resp. an isomorphism).

More generally, given a locally closed G-stable subvariety S  ⊆  X, we say that (X,D) is homogeneous ( resp. parallelizable) under G along S, if opX,D is surjective (resp. an isomorphism) at all points of S.

(i) For any homogeneous G-pair (X,D), the complement [formula] is a unique G-orbit, since opX0 is surjective. In particular, the G-variety X is almost homogeneous, and D is uniquely determined by the pair (X,G). We then say that X is a log homogeneous G-variety with boundary D. Log parallelizable G-varieties are defined similarly.

(ii) If X is complete, then the connected automorphism group [formula] is algebraic with Lie algebra being Γ(X,TX), see e.g. [\cite=MO67]. It follows that [formula] is algebraic as well, with Lie algebra being Γ(X,TX( -  log D)). Thus, (X,D) is homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) under some group G if and only if the sheaf TX( -  log D) is generated by its global sections (resp. is trivial). We then say that the pair (X,D) is homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) without specifying the group G.

(iii) The log homogeneous G-pairs (X,D), where X is a curve and G acts faithfully, are easily classified. One obtains the following list of triples (X,D,G):

(parallelizable) [formula], where G is a connected algebraic group of dimension 1, i.e., the additive group [formula], the multiplicative group [formula], or an elliptic curve.

(homogeneous) [formula] and [formula], where B denotes the automorphism group of the affine line, i.e., the Borel subgroup of [formula] that fixes [formula].

(log parallelizable) [formula] and [formula].

(log homogeneous) [formula].

The complete log homogeneous surfaces will be listed in Proposition [\ref=prop:cs].

We shall obtain a criterion for an arbitrary G-pair (X,D) to be homogeneous or parallelizable; to state it, we first recall the definition of a stratification of X associated with D. Let X0: = X, X1: = D and define inductively Xr to be the singular locus of Xr - 1 for r  ≥  2. Then the strata are the connected components of the locally closed subvarieties [formula], where [formula] Every stratum is nonsingular and G-stable; the open stratum is [formula].

Next, we analyze the normal space to a stratum S at a point x. Let again [formula] be a local equation of D at x. Then the ideal sheaf of S in X is generated (after localization and completion at x) by [formula]; in other words, S is locally the complete intersection of all branches of D. As a consequence, the normal space NS / X,x admits a canonical splitting into a direct sum of lines [formula]; the corresponding hyperplanes [formula] are the normal spaces to these branches. The isotropy group Gx preserves D and permutes its branches at x, and hence the lines [formula]; the connected component G0x stabilizes each line. Thus, the representation of Gx in NS / X,x yields a homomorphism

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the product of r copies of the multiplicative group.

We may now state our criterion:

The following conditions are equivalent for a G-pair (X,D) and a stratum S:

(i) (X,D) is homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) under G along S.

(ii) S is a unique G-orbit and for any x∈S, the homomorphism ρx is surjective (resp. an isogeny).

If one of these conditions holds, then the sequence

[formula]

is exact for any x∈S, where [formula] denotes the kernel of the representation of the isotropy Lie algebra [formula] in the normal space NS / X,x and TxX( -  log D) denotes the fiber of TX( -  log D) at x.

Clearly, TX( -  log D) preserves the ideal sheaf of S in X. This yields a morphism TX( -  log D)|S  →  TS and, in turn, a linear map

[formula]

between fibers. Given a regular system of parameters [formula] as above, the map p is just the projection of the space [formula] onto its subspace [formula]. Thus, p fits into an exact sequence

[formula]

Moreover, composing the map [formula] with p yields the map [formula] which factors through an injective map

[formula]

So we obtain a commutative diagram of exact sequences

[formula]

where the left vertical map may be identified with the differential [formula]. As a consequence, the surjectivity of the middle vertical map is equivalent to the surjectivity of both maps dρx and [formula]. If the latter condition holds, then we obtain an exact sequence

[formula]

This implies all assertions.

A direct consequence of this criterion is the following:

Let (X,D) be a homogeneous pair under G acting faithfully. Then:

(i) The G-orbits in X are exactly the strata; in particular, their number is finite.

(ii) The Tits fibration of the open orbit [formula] extends to a G-equivariant morphism

[formula]

which is invariant under C.

Next, we compare our notion of log homogeneity to the (earlier) notions of pseudofreeness and regularity. Recall from [\cite=Kn94b] that a nonsingular G-variety X is pseudofree if the image of opX (i.e., the coherent subsheaf of TX generated by the image of [formula]) is locally free. Clearly, any log homogeneous variety is pseudofree, but the converse does not hold in general. For example, the projective line where the additive group acts by affine translations is pseudofree but not log homogeneous.

Also, recall from [\cite=BDP90] that our nonsingular G-variety X is G-regular if it satisfies the following three conditions:

(i) X contains an open G-orbit whose complement is a union of irreducible divisors with normal crossings (the boundary divisors).

(ii) Any G-orbit closure in X is the transversal intersection of those boundary divisors that contain it.

(iii) For any x∈X, the normal space NG  ·  x / X,x contains an open orbit of Gx.

Every regular G-variety is log homogeneous.

By (i), the complement of the open orbit is a divisor with normal crossings. Moreover, by (ii), the strata are exactly the G-orbits, and each normal space [formula] is a direct sum of lines [formula], where each Li is preserved under Gx (as Li is the intersection of normal spaces to certain boundary divisors). Thus, Gx acts on NG  ·  x / X,x via a homomorphism

[formula]

which is surjective by (iii). So X is log homogeneous under G by Proposition [\ref=prop:crit].

The converse of this corollary also fails in general. Indeed, all G-orbit closures in a regular G-variety are also G-regular, and hence nonsingular. But there exist log parallelizable varieties in which most orbit closures are singular, see Example [\ref=ex:tw].

However, any complete log homogeneous variety X under a reductive group G is regular by [\cite=BB96]. This will be generalized to certain non-complete varieties X (and reductive groups G) in Lemma [\ref=lem:reg], and then to arbitrary groups G (and complete varieties X) in Corollary [\ref=cor:lhr].

Induced actions

Recall that a G-variety X is induced from a homogeneous space G / H if there exists a G-equivariant morphism f:X  →  G / H. Equivalently,

[formula]

where Y denotes the fiber of f at the base point, and G  ×  HY stands for the quotient of G  ×  Y by the action of H via h  ·  (g,y)  =  (gh- 1,h  ·  y). We now show that induction preserves homogeneity or parallelizability:

Let X be a G-variety and D  ⊂  X a reduced G-stable divisor. Assume that X  =  G  ×  HY for some closed subgroup H  ⊆  G and some closed H-stable subvariety Y  ⊆  X, and let [formula] (this is a reduced H-stable divisor in Y). Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) (X,D) is a homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) G-pair.

(ii) (Y,E) is a homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) H0-pair.

Clearly, X is nonsingular if and only if so is Y. Consider then the morphism

[formula]

Since f is smooth, D has normal crossings in X if and only if so has f- 1(D) in G  ×  Y. As f- 1(D)  =  G  ×  E, the latter condition means that E has normal crossings in Y.

Next, consider the exact sequence of H-linearized sheaves on Y:

[formula]

The normal sheaf NY / X is isomorphic as a H-linearized sheaf to [formula], where [formula] denotes the Lie algebra of H, and [formula] is regarded as a H-module. The sequence

[formula]

is also exact, since the composition [formula] is surjective. This yields a commutative diagram of exact sequences

[formula]

where the right vertical map is an isomorphism. Thus, the surjectivity (resp. bijectivity) of the middle vertical map is equivalent to that of the left vertical map.

As a first application of this lemma, we construct a log parallelizable variety which is not regular:

Consider the group [formula], where n  ≥  2, and the subgroup H of matrices having exactly one non-zero coefficient on each line and each column; in other words, H is the semidirect product of the maximal torus T of diagonal invertible matrices with the symmetric group Sn of permutation matrices, where Sn acts on T by permuting the diagonal entries. Let Y be the affine n-space on which H acts linearly via its standard representation. Then Y is log parallelizable under T  =  H0, and its boundary E (the union of the coordinate hyperplanes [formula]) is H-stable. The H-orbit closures in E are exactly the subsets [formula], where [formula]. In particular, E is the closure of a unique H-orbit.

Since the H-action on Y extends to a G-action, the induced variety X: = G  ×  HY is just the product G / H  ×  Y on which G acts diagonally; since H is reductive, X is affine. By the above lemma, X is log parallelizable under G; its boundary D: = G  ×  HE is a G-orbit closure, and hence is irreducible. More generally, the G-orbit closures in X are the subsets

[formula]

where [formula], together with X.

We claim that the singular locus of each Xr is Xr + 1. This claim is a consequence of Corollary [\ref=cor:fo], or may be seen directly as follows. Let Hr be the stabilizer in H of the subset [formula], so that Hr  =  TSn - r. Then the natural map

[formula]

is finite and restricts to an isomorphism over the complement of [formula], but over no larger open subset. It follows that the natural map

[formula]

is finite and birational with exceptional set Xr + 1. Since [formula] is a unique orbit, this implies our claim.

As a consequence, X is not G-regular. This may also be seen by considering the base point x: = H  ·  (1,0) of the closed orbit. Then Gx  =  H acts on the normal space [formula] via its standard representation; in particular, Gx permutes transitively the coordinate lines [formula].

As another application of Proposition [\ref=prop:Gf], we show that homogeneity and parallelizability are also preserved by taking general fibers:

Consider a homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) G-pair (X,D), a variety X', and a proper morphism f:X  →  X'. Let Y be a connected component of the fiber of f at a point of the open orbit [formula]. Then [formula] is a homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) pair.

Using the Stein factorization, we may assume that the natural map OX'  →  f*OX is an isomorphism; then all the fibers of f are connected, and the general fibers are irreducible.

By a result of Blanchard (see [\cite=Ak95] for a proof in the setting of complex geometry, which may be adapted readily to our algebraic setting), the G-action on X descends to an action on X' such that f is equivariant. Let [formula] be the open G-orbit in X'. Then f- 1(X'0) = f- 1f(X0) is an open G-stable subset of X, equivariantly isomorphic to G  ×  H'Y. In particular, all fibers over X'0 are isomorphic to Y, and hence the latter is a nonsingular variety. So the assertions follow from Proposition [\ref=prop:Gf].

Local models

A simple example of a log parallelizable variety is the affine space [formula] with its standard action of [formula]; one may also construct induced versions [formula], where H is a subtorus of G, acting on [formula] via an isogeny to [formula]. We now show that this construction yields local models for all log homogeneous varieties:

Let (X,D) be a homogeneous G-pair. Choose x∈X and let [formula] be as in ([\ref=eqn:rho]). Then there exist a subtorus H  ⊆  G0x and a H-stable locally closed subvariety Y  ⊆  X such that:

(i) The restriction of ρx to H is an isogeny to [formula].

(ii) [formula] on which H acts via the restriction [formula] and the standard action of [formula] on [formula].

(iii) The natural map p:G  ×  HY  →  X is smooth and [formula], where [formula] denotes the union of all coordinate hyperplanes.

Moreover, (X,D) is parallelizable if and only if p is étale.

We use some of the ingredients of the Luna slice theorem [\cite=Lu73]. Since ρx is surjective, we may choose a subtorus H  ⊆  G0x satisfying (i). Then there exists a H-stable decomposition

[formula]

where the H-module N is isomorphic to NG  ·  x / X,x. Moreover, the H-fixed point x admits an affine H-stable neighborhood Xx  ⊆  X together with an H-equivariant map

[formula]

such that the differential of φ at x is the identity map of TxX. In particular, φ is étale at x.

Let Y: = φ- 1(N). This is an affine H-stable locally closed subvariety of X, containing x and nonsingular at that point. Moreover, [formula] as H-modules. By the graded Nakayama lemma, it follows that Y satisfies (ii). For (iii), note that p is smooth at the point H  ·  (1,x) of G  ×  HY, since Y is a slice to the orbit G  ·  x at x. Thus, p is smooth in a G-stable neighborhood of H  ·  (1,x), which must be the whole G  ×  HY.

Finally, p is étale if and only if H  =  G0x; equivalently, ρx is an isogeny. By Proposition [\ref=prop:crit], this means that (X,D) is parallelizable.

From the above proposition, we deduce that homogeneity and parallelizability are preserved under equivariant blowing up:

(i) Let (X,D) be a homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) G-pair, X' a nonsingular G-variety, f:X'  →  X a birational G-equivariant morphism, and D' the reduced inverse image of D. Then (X',D') is a homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) G-pair.

(ii) As a partial converse, given two G-pairs (X,D), (X',D') and a surjective birational G-equivariant morphism f:X'  →  X such that D' is the reduced inverse image of D, if (X',D') is G-parallelizable, then so is (X,D).

(i) Choose x∈X and let H, Y be as in Proposition [\ref=prop:lm]. Form the cartesian square

[formula]

Then W  =  G  ×  HY', where Y': = f- 1(Y). Since p is smooth, then so is π. Thus, Y' is a nonsingular variety; it is also toric under [formula]. Hence Y' is log parallelizable by [\cite=Od88]; its boundary ∂Y' equals the reduced inverse image [formula]. It follows that the G-variety W is log parallelizable with boundary

[formula]

Since π is smooth and ∂W  =  π- 1(D'), the divisor D' has normal crossings. Moreover, the surjective map dπ:TW  →  π*TX' restricts to a surjective map

[formula]

It follows that (X',D') is G-homogeneous (resp. parallelizable if so is (X,D)).

(ii) The assumption implies that the map opX,D of ([\ref=eqn:opd]) is an isomorphism in codimension 1. Since this is a map between locally free sheaves of the same rank, it is an isomorphism.

The above statement (ii) does not extend to homogeneous pairs. For example, let [formula] acting diagonally on [formula], where [formula] denotes the incidence variety consisting of pairs (p,h) such that [formula] and [formula] is a hyperplane through p. Then the nonsingular G-variety X contains an open G-orbit with complement D consisting of those triples (p1,p2,h) such that p1,p2∈h. Thus, D is a nonsingular prime divisor in X, consisting of two G-orbits; the closed orbit Y (where p1  =  p2) is isomorphic to [formula]. Hence X consists of two strata but three orbits.

In particular, (X,D) is a nonhomogeneous G-pair. But one may check that the blowing up of Y in X is log homogeneous under G.

The Albanese fibration

For any compact Kähler almost homogenous manifold, one knows that the Albanese map is an equivariant fibration with connected fibers; see e.g. [\cite=Ak95]. The following result is an algebraic analogue for varieties that need not be complete:

Let X be a nonsingular almost homogeneous G-variety with open orbit X0 and let A(X0)  =  G / I(X0) be the Albanese variety (as defined in Subsec. [\ref=subsec:af1]). Then:

(i) The Albanese morphism

[formula]

is a G-equivariant fibration, and A(X)  =  A(X0). In particular,

[formula]

where I: = I(X0) is a closed subgroup of G containing [formula], and the fiber Y of α is a nonsingular I-variety, almost homogeneous under [formula].

(ii) If G acts faithfully on X, then I (and hence [formula]) acts faithfully on Y.

(iii) Given a reduced G-stable divisor D in X, the pair (X,D) is homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) under G if and only if [formula] is homogeneous (resp. parallelizable) under [formula]. Then the restriction to TX( -  log D) of the natural map

[formula]

fits into an exact sequence

[formula]

where Tα(  -   log D) is a G-linearized locally free sheaf, generated by the image of [formula]. Moreover, [formula].

(i) By [\cite=Mi86], the Albanese map X0  →  A(X0) extends to a morphism α:X  →  A(X0). Clearly, α is a G-equivariant fibration with fibers being almost homogeneous [formula]-varieties. In particular, any morphism from a fiber to an abelian variety is constant; it follows that α is the Albanese morphism of X.

By ([\ref=eqn:gz]), X  =  C0  ·  Y which implies (ii).

(iii) The equivalences follow from (i) together with Proposition [\ref=prop:Gf]. The final assertions are consequences of the commutative diagram

[formula]

Using this Albanese fibration, we reduce the description of the G-equivariant automorphism group [formula] to that of [formula]:

With the notation and assumptions of the above proposition, the group [formula] is algebraic and fits into an exact sequence of such groups

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] is affine.

We may identify [formula] with a subgroup of [formula], where [formula]. To show that [formula] is algebraic, we check that it is closed in NG(H) / H. For this, consider the "graph"

[formula]

and its closure Y in X  ×  X  ×  NG(H) / H. Then the projection

[formula]

is an isomorphism over the dense open subset X0  ×  NG(H) / H. Let E  ⊂  Y be the exceptional set of p1  ×  p3. Then [formula] consists of those γ∈NG(H) / H such that X  ×  X  ×  {γ} does not meet E. Thus, [formula] is a constructible subgroup of NG(H) / H, and hence is closed.

Next, we obtain the exact sequence ([\ref=eqn:ig]). By the universal property of the Albanese morphism, any G-equivariant automorphism of X induces an equivariant automorphism of the abelian variety A(X), that is, a translation. This yields a group homomorphism

[formula]

which is the restriction of the natural homomorphism

[formula]

and hence is algebraic. The composition [formula] is surjective by Lemma [\ref=lem:G], so that f is surjective. Since [formula], the kernel of f is isomorphic to [formula].

As in the first step of the proof, [formula] is a closed subgroup of NI(H) / H, and hence is affine since I is.

We consider again a nonsingular variety X, almost homogeneous under a faithful action on G, and we use the notation of Proposition [\ref=prop:ar].

(i) Let [formula] be as in ([\ref=eqn:if]). Then F acts on Y via a homomorphism

[formula]

Thus, if every [formula]-equivariant automorphism of Y comes from some element of [formula], then [formula] (since I acts faithfully on Y). Equivalently, the isogeny A(G)  →  A(X) is an isomorphism under this assumption.

(ii) In general, we may reduce to the case where A(G)  =  A(X), just by replacing X with the finite étale cover [formula] and keeping G unchanged.

We may reduce further to the case where the isogeny A(C0)  →  A(G) (Lemma [\ref=lem:G]) is an isomorphism, by replacing X with the finite étale cover

[formula]

and G with the finite cover

[formula]

Then the Albanese map

[formula]

is locally trivial for the Zariski topology, since the algebraic group [formula] is commutative, connected and affine.

In the above remark, both covers of X are just the pull-backs under the Albanese map of the isogenies A(G)  →  A(X), resp. A(C0)  →  A(G). We now show that every finite étale cover of an almost homogeneous variety is obtained in that way, under the assumption of completeness:

Let X be a complete nonsingular variety, almost homogeneous under a faithful G-action. Let f:X'  →  X be an étale morphism, where X' is a complete (nonsingular) variety. Then X' is almost homogeneous under a faithful action of a finite cover G' of G. Moreover, f induces an isogeny φ:A(X')  →  A(X), and the square

[formula]

is cartesian.

Note that any derivation of OX extends to a unique derivation of f*OX'. This yields an injective homomorphism of Lie algebras

[formula]

Moreover, the image of i is an algebraic Lie subalgebra, since it consists of those derivations that preserve the field of rational functions on X. Thus, [formula] is algebraic as well; let [formula] be the associated algebraic group. Then G' is a finite cover of G, and has an open orbit in X'.

The universal property of the Albanese morphism yields a commutative square ([\ref=eqn:sq]), where φ is a homomorphism. We also have a commutative square

[formula]

where the three nonlabeled arrows are isogenies. It follows that φ is an isogeny as well. So the fibers Y, Y' of α, resp. α', have the same dimension and satisfy Y'  ⊆  f- 1(Y). But Y is unirational and hence simply connected (see [\cite=SGA1]); thus, f restricts to an isomorphism Y'  →  Y. This implies that the square ([\ref=eqn:sq]) is cartesian.

The complete log parallelizable case

We shall obtain an algebraic version of the main result of [\cite=Wi04] describing the log parallelizable compact "weakly Kähler" manifolds. To state our version, recall that a semiabelian variety is an algebraic group obtained as an extension of an abelian variety by a torus; any semiabelian variety is connected and commutative.

Let X be a complete nonsingular variety on which a connected algebraic group G acts faithfully. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) X is log parallelizable under G.

(ii) [formula], where [formula] is a torus and Y is a complete nonsingular toric variety under [formula].

(iii) G is a semiabelian variety and has an open orbit in X.

Under one of these conditions, [formula], where D denotes the boundary.

(i)⇒  (ii) We use the notation of Proposition [\ref=prop:ar]. Note that Y is log homogeneous under [formula]. Choose y∈Y such that the orbit [formula] is closed. Then the isotropy group [formula] is a parabolic subgroup of [formula]. Hence [formula] is connected and contains a maximal unipotent subgroup of [formula]. On the other hand, G0y is contained in [formula], and is isogenous to a torus by Proposition [\ref=prop:crit]. It follows that [formula] is a torus and, in turn, that [formula] is a torus as well.

Hence Y is a toric [formula]-variety, so that the natural map [formula] is an isomorphism. This implies that [formula] by Remark [\ref=rem:sim](i).

(ii)⇒  (iii) is obvious.

(iii)⇒  (i) Since G is commutative and acts faithfully in X, its open orbit is isomorphic to G itself. Together with Proposition [\ref=prop:ar], it follows that [formula], where Y contains an open orbit of the torus [formula]. Thus, Y is log parallelizable (see e.g. [\cite=Od88]) and hence so is X.

Under the condition (i), we have the equalities of Lie algebras

[formula]

and hence [formula].

This displays the close relationship between log parallelizable and semiabelic varieties; recall from [\cite=Al02] that the latter are the normal varieties on which a semiabelian variety acts with finitely many orbits, such that all isotropy groups are tori. By the above theorem, being log parallelizable or semiabelic are equivalent for complete nonsingular varieties.

Complete log homogeneous varieties

Relation to spherical varieties

We consider a complete log homogeneous G-variety X and write [formula] as in Proposition [\ref=prop:ar], so that Y is a complete nonsingular variety, log homogeneous under [formula]. In this subsection, we obtain several preliminary results about the [formula]-variety Y; together, they will imply our main structure theorem in the next subsection.

Choose a Levi subgroup [formula], i.e., a maximal closed connected reductive subgroup. Recall the semidirect product decomposition [formula], where [formula] denotes the unipotent radical; moreover, any two Levi subgroups are conjugate by an element of [formula].

For a [formula]-pair (Y,E) where Y is complete, the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) (Y,E) is homogeneous under [formula].

(ii) (Y,E) is homogeneous under L along each closed [formula]-orbit.

If one of these conditions holds, then there exists a smallest open L-stable subset YL  ⊆  Y which contains every closed [formula]-orbit. Then the pair [formula] is homogeneous under L, and every [formula]-orbit in Y meets YL along a unique L-orbit. In particular, the closed L-orbits in YL are exactly the closed [formula]-orbits in Y.

(i)⇒  (ii) As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:lpt], choose y∈Y such that the orbit G  ·  y is closed, i.e., Gy is a parabolic subgroup of [formula]. Then [formula] and [formula]. Clearly, the homomorphism [formula] of ([\ref=eqn:rho]) has a trivial restriction to [formula]. Thus, by Proposition [\ref=prop:crit], (Y,E) is homogeneous under L along [formula].

(ii)⇒  (i) The assumption implies that the map opY,E is surjective along any closed [formula]-orbit. Thus, opY,E is surjective everywhere.

If (ii) holds, then there exists an open L-stable subvariety Y'  ⊆  Y containing all the closed [formula]-orbits, such that the pair [formula] is homogeneous under L. In particular, Y' contains only finitely many L-orbits, and every closed [formula]-orbit in Y is a closed L-orbit in Y'. Let YL be the set of those y∈Y such that the orbit closure [formula] contains a closed [formula]-orbit. Then YL is contained in Y' and is the smallest common open L-stable neighborhood of all the closed [formula]-orbits.

As a consequence [formula] is an open G-stable neighborhood of the closed G-orbits, so that [formula]. In other words, every [formula]-orbit Ω in Y meets YL. Since the L-orbits in YL are the strata of the pair [formula], i.e., the intersections of YL with the strata of (Y,E), it follows that [formula] is a unique L-orbit.

Next, we obtain a partial converse of Corollary [\ref=cor:rlh]:

Let Y be a log homogeneous variety under a connected reductive group L. If every closed orbit is complete, then the L-variety Y is spherical and regular. Moreover, its closed orbits are all isomorphic.

This is proved in [\cite=BB96] under the assumption that Y is complete; the argument there may be adapted as follows. Choose y∈Y such that the orbit L  ·  y is closed, so that Ly is a parabolic subgroup of L. Let P  ⊆  L be a parabolic subgroup opposite to Ly, so that

[formula]

is a Levi subgroup of both P and Ly. By the local structure theorem (see e.g. [\cite=Kn94a]), there exists a locally closed affine M-stable subvariety S  ⊆  Y containing y, such that the map

[formula]

is an open immersion. In particular, S is nonsingular and meets transversally L  ·  y at the unique point y. This yields a M-equivariant isomorphism

[formula]

In particular, M acts on [formula] via a surjective homomorphism to [formula], and hence the derived subgroup of M fixes TyS pointwise. As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:lm], it follows that [formula] as M-varieties, and the boundary of Y meets S along the union of all the coordinate hyperplanes in [formula]. Thus, the L-variety Y is regular in a neighborhood of L  ·  y. Moreover, the image of [formula] in Y is the open orbit of a Borel subgroup B of L, so that Y is spherical as well. Finally, one checks that the stabilizer in L of this open B-orbit equals the parabolic subgroup P. In particular, the conjugacy class of P is independent of the closed orbit L  ·  y. Thus, the same holds for the conjugacy class of the opposite parabolic subgroup Ly.

Finally, we record the following result, a consequence of [\cite=Kn96].

Let Y be a spherical L-variety, and Y'  ⊂  Y an open L-stable subset. Then [formula] is a diagonalizable algebraic group and preserves Y'; in particular, [formula] is a torus. Moreover, the restriction map [formula] is an isomorphism.

Structure

We now come to our main result:

Let G be a connected algebraic group and choose a Levi subgroup [formula]. Then any complete log homogeneous G-variety X may be written uniquely as G  ×  IY, where

(i) I  ⊆  G is a closed subgroup containing [formula] as a subgroup of finite index.

(ii) Y is a complete nonsingular I-variety containing an open L-stable subset YL such that

(a) the L-variety YL is regular, and

(b) every [formula]-orbit in Y meets YL along a unique L-orbit.

In particular, the L-variety Y is spherical, and the projection X  →  G / I is the Albanese morphism.

Conversely, given I and Y satisfying (i) and (ii), the G-variety X: = G  ×  IY is log homogeneous. Moreover, each I-orbit in Y is a unique [formula]-orbit; in particular, each G-orbit in X meets Y (resp. YL) along a unique orbit of [formula] (resp. L).

All the assertions follow from Proposition [\ref=prop:ar] and Lemmas [\ref=lem:lhp], [\ref=lem:reg], except for the equality of I-orbits and [formula]-orbits. For the latter, let again [formula] be as in ([\ref=eqn:if]). The finite subgroup F  ⊆  C0 acts on Y by [formula]-equivariant automorphisms. Thus, F preserves all L-orbits by Lemma [\ref=lem:aut], and hence all [formula]-orbits.

Next, we obtain some remarkable consequences of this structure theorem.

Any complete log homogeneous G-variety X is G-regular; in particular, any G-stable subvariety is log homogeneous. Moreover, the irreducible components of fibers of any morphism f:X  →  X' are log homogeneous.

The first assertion follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:str] together with the L-regularity of YL (Lemma [\ref=lem:reg]).

For the second assertion, let C be an irreducible component of a fiber and let X' be the closure of G  ·  C in X. Then X' is a G-stable subvariety of the regular variety X, and hence is regular as well. So the assertion follows by applying Corollary [\ref=cor:lhf] to f|X'.

Also, we rephrase the most delicate condition (b) in the statement of Theorem [\ref=thm:str], to make it easier to check:

Let Y be a complete nonsingular [formula]-variety, and YL  ⊆  Y an L-stable open subset. Assume that YL is L-regular and contains all the closed [formula]-orbits in Y. Let ∂YL be the boundary of the L-variety YL, and [formula]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(b) Every [formula]-orbit in Y meets YL along a unique L-orbit.

(c) YL is not contained in E.

(d) ∂YL is stable under [formula] (acting on YL by vector fields).

Under one of these conditions, (Y,E) is a [formula]-homogeneous pair.

Notice that [formula] is a G-stable open subset of Y containing all the closed G-orbits, whence [formula]. In other words, every [formula]-orbit in Y meets YL.

(b)⇒  (c) is obvious.

(c)⇒  (d) The assumption implies the equality [formula], which in turn implies the desired statement.

(d)⇒  (b) By our assumption, E does not meet the open [formula]-orbit in Y. It follows that [formula]. On the other hand, E is a divisor with normal crossings (since so is ∂YL), and its complement is the open [formula]-orbit in Y. Moreover, each stratum of (Y,E) meets YL along a unique stratum of (YL,∂YL), i.e., a unique L-orbit. Together with Proposition [\ref=prop:crit], this completes the proof.

The Tits morphism

In this subsection, we consider a complete log homogeneous variety X under a faithful action of G. Let

[formula]

be the G-morphism defined in Corollary [\ref=cor:fo]. We say that τ is the Tits morphism of X, and we denote its image by L(X)  ⊆  L.

Clearly, L(X) is a projective G-variety, fixed pointwise by C. Moreover, in the notation of Theorem [\ref=thm:str], L(X)  =  L(Y), and the restriction τ|Y is the Tits morphism of the complete log homogeneous [formula]-variety Y. The sheaf TX(  -   log D) is the pull-back under τ of the quotient sheaf on L(X) (regarded as a subvariety of the Grassmannian of subspaces of [formula]). Further properties of τ are gathered in the following:

(i) The G-variety L(X) contains a unique closed orbit F(X), and τ maps every closed [formula]-orbit in Y isomorphically to F(X).

(ii) The irreducible components of the fibers of τ are log parallelizable varieties.

(i) By the above observations, we may assume that G is affine, i.e., X  =  Y. Let x∈X such that the orbit G  ·  x is closed. Then [formula]. Moreover, the Lie subalgebra [formula] is the intersection of the kernels of differentials of characters of the isotropy group Gx, a parabolic subgroup of G. It follows that [formula]; hence τ restricts to an isomorphism

[formula]

Moreover, Gx  =  Ru(G)Lx, where L is a Levi subgroup of G and the conjugacy class of Lx in L is independent of the closed G-orbit G  ·  x by Lemma [\ref=lem:reg]. Thus, the orbit [formula] is also independent of the closed G-orbit.

(ii) By Corollary [\ref=cor:lhr], the irreducible components of fibers of τ are nonsingular. To show that they are log parallelizable, it suffices to consider fibers at points y∈Y. Then

[formula]

is mapped by α onto [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

Since [formula] is a fiber of the Tits morphism of Y, we are reduced to checking that the irreducible components of fibers of that morphism are toric varieties. In other words, we may assume again that G is affine.

Choose a point x∈F(X). Applying the local structure theorem as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:reg], we obtain a parabolic subgroup P  ⊆  L and a locally closed affine subvariety S  ⊆  L(X) containing x, such that the natural map

[formula]

is an open immersion. Moreover, S is stable under [formula], a Levi subgroup of both P and Lx. It follows that τ- 1(S) is a locally closed M-stable subvariety of X, and the natural map

[formula]

is an open immersion as well.

Together with (i), this implies that G  ·  τ- 1(S) is an open subset of X, containing all the closed G-orbits. Thus, τ- 1(S) meets all G-orbits, and it suffices to check the desired assertion for the fibers of the restriction τ- 1(S)  →  S. But one shows as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:reg] that τ- 1(S) is fixed pointwise by the derived subgroup of M, and is a toric variety under a quotient of C(M)0. It follows that the irreducible components of every fiber τ- 1(s) are toric varieties under a quotient of the isotropy group C(M)0s.

(i) The Tits map is constant if and only if X is log parallelizable.

(ii) Likewise, the flag variety F(X) is a point if and only if every closed G-orbit in X is an abelian variety. This is also equivalent to the solvability of the group G (or of [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:G]).

Indeed, if [formula] is solvable, then every closed [formula]-orbit in Y is a point. Thus, every closed G-orbit in X is isomorphic to A(X). Conversely, if F(X) is a point, then YL contains a fixed point of L. By Proposition [\ref=prop:crit], it follows that L  =  T is a torus, and hence [formula] is solvable.

Next, we consider the product morphism α  ×  τ:X  →  A(X)  ×  L(X) for which we obtain a generalization of the Borel-Remmert theorem:

With the above notation, α  ×  τ is surjective, and all irreducible components of its fibers are nonsingular toric varieties.

Moreover, α  ×  τ maps isomorphically every closed G-orbit in X to A(X)  ×  F(X), the unique closed G-orbit in A(X)  ×  L(X).

The surjectivity of α  ×  τ follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:at], and the assertion on its fibers has been established in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:tm].

By that proposition, any closed G-orbit in A(X)  ×  L(X) is contained in A(X)  ×  F(X). But the latter is a unique G-orbit, since C0 acts transitively on A(X) and fixes pointwise L(X).

The closed G-orbits in X are exactly the subsets G  ×  IY', where Y'  ⊆  Y is a closed orbit of I or, equivalently, of [formula]. Moreover, the restriction of α to G  ×  IY' is the projection to G / I, and τ restricts to an isomorphism [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop:tm] again. This implies that the restriction of α  ×  τ to G  ×  IY' is an isomorphism to A(X)  ×  F(X).

In fact, the connected components of fibers of α  ×  τ (regarded as reduced subschemes of X) are "stable toric varieties" in the sense of [\cite=Al02], as shown by the argument of Proposition [\ref=prop:tm]. Likewise, the connected components of fibers of τ are "stable semiabelic varieties".

The morphism α  ×  τ may also be used to describe the complete log homogeneous varieties having a nonconnected boundary, analogously to a result of complex geometry (see [\cite=HO84] and its references):

The complete log homogeneous varieties X having a nonconnected boundary are exactly the projective line bundles over the product A  ×  F of an abelian variety with a flag variety, obtained as projective completions of line bundles [formula], where L  →  A is a line bundle of degree 0, and M  →  F is an arbitrary line bundle. Then the Albanese map of X is the projection to A  =  A(X), and the Tits map is the projection to F  =  L(X)  =  F(X).

Let (X,D) be a homogeneous pair with X complete and D nonconnected. Write X  =  G  ×  IY and D  =  G  ×  IE, so that E is not connected as well. Let [formula] be a maximal unipotent subgroup. By [\cite=Ho69], the fixed point set YU is connected. Hence the open [formula]-orbit [formula] contains U-fixed points. In particular, [formula] fixes Y pointwise; we may thus assume that [formula] is reductive. Let [formula] be the isotropy group of [formula]. Since J  ⊇  U, then [formula] is a parabolic subgroup of [formula] and the quotient P / J is a torus (see e.g. [\cite=Ti06]). Thus, the normalization W of the closure [formula] is a complete toric variety under P / J. Since the natural morphism

[formula]

is birational and G-equivariant, and the boundary of any complete toric variety of dimension ≥  2 is connected, we must have dim (W)  =  1, i.e., [formula] and [formula]. And since Y is nonsingular and E is a divisor, it follows that π is an isomorphism. In other words, Y is the projective line bundle over [formula] associated with the principal [formula]-bundle [formula] or with the corresponding line bundle M  →  F. The Tits morphism is just the structure map Y  →  F, so that F  =  F(X)  =  L(X).

As a consequence, α  ×  τ is a projective line bundle over A(X)  ×  F, associated with a line bundle of the form [formula] for some line bundle L  →  A(X) = :A. Since L is G-linearized, it has degree 0.

Conversely, any such projective bundle is a complete log homogeneous variety with boundary being the union of the zero and infinity sections.

Returning to an arbitrary complete log homogeneous variety X under a faithful action of G, we show that the Stein factorization of the Tits morphism τ is intrinsic (although τ is not):

With the above notation, let

[formula]

be the Stein factorization of the Tits morphism. Then:

(i) S(X) is a normal projective G-variety, fixed pointwise by C0, and spherical under any Levi subgroup of [formula].

(ii) G has a unique closed orbit in S(X); it is isomorphic to F(X).

(iii) σ is the morphism associated with the section ring of the globally generated divisor -  KX  -  D, where D denotes the boundary of X. In particular, σ depends only on the pair (X,D).

(iv) τ (or, equivalently, σ) is finite if and only if -  KX  -  D is ample. Likewise, α  ×  τ (or α  ×  σ) is finite if and only if -  KX  -  D is ample relatively to α.

(i) follows from the construction of σ.

(ii) It suffices to show that φ restricts to an isomorphism over F(X). As in the proof of the above proposition, choose a maximal unipotent subgroup [formula]. Then [formula] is a Borel subgroup of [formula]. The fixed point subset L(X)B consists of a unique point z, which lies in F(X). Moreover, L(X)U is connected and B-stable, where B acts on this set through the torus B / U. It follows that L(X)U also consists of z. Since φ is finite, then S(X)U  =  φ- 1(z) (as sets). But S(X)U is connected as well, so that it consists of a unique point z'. Since [formula] is a subgroup of finite index of [formula] and the latter is a parabolic subgroup of [formula], then

[formula]

is an isomorphism.

(iii) The map opX,D induces a surjective map

[formula]

where n  =   dim (X). Taking global sections, we obtain a linear map

[formula]

with base-point-free image. The corresponding morphism

[formula]

may be identified with τ, regarded as a morphism to the Grassmann variety of n-dimensional quotients of [formula]. This yields our assertion.

(iv) follows from (iii) together with Proposition [\ref=prop:tm].

In view of these results, one may ask if the Stein factorization of α  ×  τ is α  ×  σ, i.e., if the fibers of the latter morphism are connected. The answer is generally negative, as shown by the following:

Let A be an abelian variety and choose a point a∈A of order 2. Consider

[formula]

where F denotes the group of order 2 acting on A via translation by a, and on [formula] by exchanging the two copies. The group

[formula]

acts on X via its action on [formula] by

[formula]

(which commutes with F). Then X is a projective nonsingular variety, log homogeneous under a faithful G-action; the boundary is the prime divisor

[formula]

Moreover, A(X)  =  A / F, [formula], [formula] and [formula].

One checks that the Tits morphism τ may be identified with the natural map

[formula]

As a consequence, τ has connected fibers (isomorphic to A over [formula], resp. to A / F over D). But α  ×  τ is identified with the natural map

[formula]

a double cover ramified along D.

However, α  ×  σ has connected fibers when X is replaced with a suitable étale cover, see Lemma [\ref=lem:sim] below.

The equivariant automorphism group

We consider the group [formula], where [formula] still denotes a complete log homogeneous G-variety. We first obtain a stronger version of Lemma [\ref=lem:ea]:

[formula] is diagonalizable and equals [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is commutative and preserves every G-orbit in X.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:aut], the subgroup [formula] is diagonalizable; in particular, commutative. Moreover, writing [formula] as in ([\ref=eqn:if]), the group F acts on Y via [formula]-equivariant automorphisms. Thus, [formula].

The group [formula] is generated by C0 and [formula], and these commutative groups commute pairwise. Thus, [formula] is commutative (alternatively, this follows from the exact sequence ([\ref=eqn:ig]) together with the commutativity of any extension of an abelian variety by a diagonalizable group). Moreover, [formula] preserves all the [formula]-orbits in Y by Lemma [\ref=lem:aut]. Thus, [formula] preserves all the G-orbits.

Next, we describe the connected equivariant automorphism group:

(i) [formula] is a semiabelian variety, and its Albanese variety is A(X).

(ii) Let [formula] be the open G-orbit in X. Then

[formula]

Moreover, [formula].

(iii) [formula] is the connected center of [formula], and acts with an open orbit on any component of a general fiber of the Tits morphism τ.

(i) follows from the above proposition together with ([\ref=eqn:ig]).

(ii) We claim that the (injective) restriction map

[formula]

is surjective. For this, we may reduce to the case where [formula] and X  =  Y by using ([\ref=eqn:ig]). Then any element of [formula] extends to an automorphism of X, by Lemma [\ref=lem:aut]. This extension must be G-equivariant; this proves our claim.

It remains to show that NG(H)  =  NG(H0). For this, by the inclusions

[formula]

it suffices to check that NG(H0) / H0 is commutative. By Lemma [\ref=lem:G], we may assume again that [formula]; then

[formula]

and the latter group is commutative, since the L-variety G / H0 (a finite covering of G / H) is spherical by Lemma [\ref=lem:reg].

(iii) Clearly, [formula] contains the connected center of [formula]. To show the equality, it suffices to check that both groups have the same dimension. But by (ii), [formula] equals the dimension of the general fibers of τ, and the latter dimension depends only on (X,D) by Proposition [\ref=prop:sf].

Recall that the restriction τ|X0 is the natural map [formula]. Together with ([\ref=eqn:iso]), this implies that any component of a fiber of τ|X0 is a unique [formula]-orbit.

We now investigate the relation between the connected equivariant automorphism group and the morphism σ:X  →  S(X):

Let X be a complete log homogeneous variety with boundary D and put [formula]. Denote by E the subsheaf of the tangent sheaf TS(X), generated by the image of [formula]. Then E is locally free, i.e., the G-variety S(X) is pseudo-free. Moreover, there is an exact sequence of G-linearized sheaves

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Lie algebra of C.

We claim that [formula] for all x∈X. Indeed, [formula] is the Lie algebra of the group C0(x), and the latter fixes pointwise G  ·  x and its normal space at x. Moreover, C0(x) is a torus by Lemma [\ref=lem:H] and Proposition [\ref=prop:cc](i). Thus, C0(x) is trivial.

By that claim, the image of the Tits map (regarded as a morphism to the Grassmannian [formula] of subspaces of [formula]) consists of subspaces V such that [formula]. Let [formula] be the corresponding open subset, and [formula] the projection. Then the restriction to [formula] of the quotient sheaf [formula] on [formula] fits into an exact sequence

[formula]

Pulling back to X yields an exact sequence

[formula]

where F is a G-linearized locally free sheaf on L(X) (the pull-back of the quotient sheaf). In turn, this implies the exact sequence ([\ref=eqn:pf]), where E  =  φ*F for the morphism φ:S(X)  →  L(X). Also, E is generated by a subspace of global sections, the image of the composite map

[formula]

The restriction of ([\ref=eqn:pf]) to the open orbit X0  =  G  ·  x  ⊆  X corresponds to the exact sequence of H-modules

[formula]

where H  =  Gx. It follows that the restriction of E to the open orbit G  ·  σ(x)  ⊆  S(X) is the tangent sheaf. Moreover, the locally free sheaf E is a subsheaf of i*(i*E), where i:G  ·  σ(x)  →  S(X) denotes the inclusion. Thus, E may be identified with the OS(X)-subsheaf of derivations of the function field of S(X), generated by the image of [formula].

The exact sequence ([\ref=eqn:pf]) means that the relative logarithmic tangent sheaf Tσ(  -   log D) is isomorphic to [formula]. This may be seen as a differential version of the fact that the general fibers of σ are C0-orbits (Proposition [\ref=prop:cc](iii)).

Likewise, there is an exact sequence

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Lie algebra of [formula]. In other words, the relative logarithmic tangent sheaf of α  ×  σ is isomorphic to [formula].

Finally, we consider again the morphism σ:X  →  S(X), under the assumption that A(X)  =  A(C0) (this may be achieved by replacing X with a finite étale cover, see Remark [\ref=rem:sim](ii)).

If the isogeny A(C0)  →  A(X) is an isomorphism, then all fibers of α  ×  σ are connected. Equivalently, the Stein factorization of α  ×  τ is α  ×  σ.

By assumption, both isogenies A(C0)  →  A(G) and A(G)  →  A(X) are isomorphisms. Thus, [formula] is connected, and [formula]. So [formula] and [formula]. Hence the restriction τ|X0 has fiber at the base point

[formula]

The components of this fiber are the orbits of the group

[formula]

Thus, the restriction of α to every such component has irreducible fibers, isomorphic to [formula]. The assertion follows.

Strongly log homogeneous varieties

Consider again a complete log homogeneous G-variety [formula]. We say that X is strongly log homogeneous if Y is regular under some connected reductive subgroup of [formula].

This condition holds, for example, if G is solvable (since Y is then a toric variety under a maximal torus of G). But it fails, e.g., when X  =  Y is the projective completion of the tangent bundle [formula], and D is the divisor at infinity. Then one checks that the pair (X,D) is homogeneous, and a Levi subgroup of [formula] is [formula], where [formula] acts naturally on X, and [formula] acts by multiplication on the fibers of [formula]. Moreover, the L-orbits in X are the zero section [formula], the projectivization [formula] (isomorphic to the flag variety of [formula]), and the complement [formula]; each of them is a unique [formula]-orbit. Thus, X is not regular under L or [formula]. Moreover, both closed L-orbits are fixed pointwise by [formula], and they are not simultaneously regular under any proper reductive subgroup of [formula]. So X cannot be strongly log homogeneous with boundary D.

We shall obtain a criterion for strong log homogeneity which is much simpler than our characterization of log homogeneity (Theorem [\ref=thm:str]). To motivate the following statement, observe that the boundary of the strongly log homogeneous G-variety X is G  ×  IE, where E is a subdivisor of the boundary of the L-variety Y.

Let L be a connected reductive group, Y a complete regular L-variety, ∂Y its boundary, and E  ⊂  ∂Y a subdivisor. Write

[formula]

where [formula] are L-stable prime divisors. Then the pair (Y,E) is (strongly) log homogeneous if and only if [formula] are all generated by their global sections.

Under one of these assumptions, we have an exact sequence

[formula]

where NDi / Y denotes the normal sheaf. Moreover, Hj(Y,TY(  -   log E))  =  0 for all j  ≥  1.

We adapt arguments from [\cite=BB96]; we provide details for completeness. Consider the map

[formula]

obtained by taking the direct sum of the natural maps TY  →  NDi / Y and then restricting to TY( -  log E). Clearly, the kernel of p is TY(  -   log ∂Y). Moreover, by using a local system of parameters, one checks that p is surjective. This yields a short exact sequence

[formula]

Taking the associated long exact sequence of cohomology groups and using the vanishing of Hj(Y,TY(  -   log ∂Y)) for j  ≥  1 (a consequence of [\cite=Kn94b]), we obtain the short exact sequence ([\ref=eqn:httn]) and isomorphisms

[formula]

for all j  ≥  1.

From the exact sequences ([\ref=eqn:httn]), ([\ref=eqn:ttn]) and the global generation of TY( -  log ∂Y) (Corollary [\ref=cor:rlh]), it follows that TY( -  log E) is globally generated if and only if so is each NDi / Y. Moreover, from the standard exact sequence

[formula]

and the vanishing of Hj(Y,OY) for j  ≥  1 (which follows e.g. from [\cite=Ti06]), we obtain an exact sequence

[formula]

and isomorphisms

[formula]

for all j  ≥  1. Hence the global generation of NDi / Y is equivalent to that of OY(Di). The latter implies the vanishing of Hj(Y,OY(Di)) for all j  ≥  1, since any globally generated invertible sheaf on a complete spherical variety has vanishing higher cohomology (see [\cite=Ti06] again). By ([\ref=eqn:hh]) and ([\ref=eqn:cong]), this implies in turn the vanishing of the Hj(Y,TY( -  log E)). Also, we have shown that the global generation of TY( -  log E) is equivalent to that of [formula].

This criterion may be formulated in combinatorial terms by using the characterization of globally generated divisors on spherical varieties, see e.g. [\cite=Ti06]. For example, if L is a torus, i.e., Y is a toric variety, let Δ be the corresponding fan, and [formula] the rays associated with [formula]. Then the global generation of Di is equivalent to the convexity of the union of all the cones of Δ that do not contain ρi (in other words, the complement of the star of ρi).

Proposition [\ref=prop:slh] is the main ingredient in the classification of complete log homogeneous surfaces (see Remark [\ref=rem:lh](iii) for the much easier classification of log homogeneous curves):

Up to isomorphism, the pairs (X,D), where X is a complete log homogeneous surface with boundary D, are those in the following list:

(parallelizable) [formula], where A is an abelian surface.

(homogeneous) [formula], where E is an elliptic curve, [formula], and [formula].

(log parallelizable) X is the projective completion of a line bundle of degree 0 on an elliptic curve, and D is the union of the zero and infinity sections.

(log homogeneous)

(a) [formula], where E is an elliptic curve.

(b) [formula].

(c) [formula], where C is a conic.

(d) [formula], where D is a subdivisor of the boundary of the toric variety [formula], i.e., a union of coordinate lines.

(e) [formula], where D is a subdivisor of the boundary of the toric variety [formula].

(f) [formula], where [formula] is the rational ruled surface of index n  ≥  1 and D is a subdivisor of the boundary of the toric variety [formula] that contains the unique curve C- n of self-intersection - n.

(g) All pairs obtained from those in (d), (e), (f) by successively blowing up intersection points of boundary curves.

We refer to [\cite=Od88] for a description of [formula] regarded as a toric surface. We outline the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:cs], leaving the easy but rather long details to the reader. The parallelizable resp. homogeneous cases are straightforward, and the log parallelizable case follows either from Theorem [\ref=thm:lpt] or from Proposition [\ref=prop:ncb]. So we may assume that D is nonempty and connected. If D is irreducible, then by looking at the minimal model of X, one obtains Cases (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) (where D is a line), as well as (f) (where D  =  C- n). Otherwise, X contains a fixed point of G, namely, the intersection of two boundary curves. By Theorem [\ref=thm:atm] and Remark [\ref=rem:sol](ii), it follows that G is affine and solvable. In particular, X is a toric surface and D is a subdivisor of the toric boundary. Then the statement follows from Proposition [\ref=prop:slh] by elementary arguments of two-dimensional toric geometry.

(i) In Cases (a)-(e), the only possibility for the acting group G is the full automorphism group [formula]. But this does not extend to Case (f): consider, for example, the pair

[formula]

where F0 and F∞ are the fibers of the ruling

[formula]

at the corresponding points. Then [formula] is the semidirect product of the group [formula] (acting by translations) with a torus T of dimension 2 (acting on U via the image of a maximal torus of [formula]). Moreover, we may take for G the semidirect product of V with T, where V  ⊆  U is any T-stable subspace without base points; there are 2n - 1 such subspaces.

(ii) For (X,D) as in ([\ref=eqn:bad]) and [formula], the image of σ is the normal surface obtained from [formula] by contracting C- n. Indeed, the group [formula] is trivial, so that σ is birational. Moreover, σ maps the two G-fixed points [formula] and [formula] to the same point.

In particular, the variety S(X) is singular if n  ≥  2. One may also check that φ:S(X)  →  L(X) is bijective for all n, so that L(X) is also singular if n  ≥  2.
