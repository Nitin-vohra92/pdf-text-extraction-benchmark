Wave-particle duality and 'bipartite' wave functions for a single particle

Wave-particle duality, as manifest in the two-slit experiment, provides perhaps the most vivid illustration of Bohr's complementarity principle which refers to the ability of quantum-mechanical entities to behave as waves or particles under different experiment conditions [\cite=Bohr]. Wave-like (interference) behaviour can be explained by the superposition principle [\cite=Dirac], while the usual explanation for the loss of interference (particle-like behaviour) in a which-way experiment is based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle [\cite=Feynman]. However, it is demonstrated in the which-way experiment with an atom interferometer that Heisenberg's position-momentum uncertainty relation cannot explain the loss of interference for which the correlations between the which-way detector and the atomic beams are considered to be responsible [\cite=DNR]. This explanation for particle-like behaviour refers to quantum measurement and so is inconsistent with the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics [\cite=M]. From a theoretical point of view, a measurement-free express of wave-particle duality deserves research.

Recently, an differential equation for wave functions is proposed for a single particle, which is equivalent to Schrödinger's wave equation and can be used to determine energy-level gaps of the system [\cite=Chen]. Contrary to Schrödinger's wave equation, this equation is on 'bipartite' wave functions. It is shown that these 'bipartite' wave functions satisfy all the basic properties of Schrödinger's wave functions which correspond to those 'bipartite' wave functions of product forms. Here, we will show that this extension of Schrödinger's form establishes a mathematical expression of wave-particle duality and that von Neumann's entropy is a quantitative measure of complementarity between wave-like and particle-like behaviors. It is concluded that a single particle behaves like waves when it interfere with itself, while like particle when entangle with itself. Thus, wave-particle duality is just the complementarity of interference and entanglement for a single particle. Further, from this formalism it is concluded that collapses of Schrödinger's wave functions can be regarded as the simultaneous transition of the particle from many levels to one. This sheds considerable light on quantum measurement.

Consider the quantum system of a single particle. Note that the Hamiltonian for a single particle in an external field is

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] is the potential energy of the particle in the external field, and [formula] The Schrödinger's wave equation describing dynamics of the particle is

[formula]

It is well known that the basis of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics lies in the proposition that the state of the particle can be described by a definite wave function ψ of Equation (2), whose stationary states determine its energy levels. Moreover, the expectation value of an observable [formula] in the state corresponding to ψ is determined by 〈〉ψ  =  〈ψ||ψ〉.

On the other hand, it is shown by the author [\cite=Chen] that the states of a single particle can also be described by definite 'bipartite' wave functions that obey the following equation

[formula]

which is mathematically equivalent to Schrödinger's wave equation (2) and whose stationary states determine the energy-level gaps of the system. In particular, the expectation value of an observable [formula] in the state corresponding to a definite 'bipartite' wave function Ψ is determined by

[formula]

where ϱΨ is an operator on L2 associated with Ψ defined by [formula] for every φ∈L2, provided Ψ is normalized. It is easy to check that if [formula] then 〈Ô〉Ψ  =  〈ψ|Ô|ψ〉. This concludes that our expression Eq.(4) agrees with the interpretation of Schrödinger's wave functions for calculating expectation values of any chosen observable.

The 'bipartite' wave function Ψ of physical meaning should be 'Hermitian':

[formula]

Schrödinger's wave functions correspond to those 'bipartite' wave functions of product forms [formula] Other 'bipartite' wave functions that cannot be written as product forms are 'entangled' [\cite=EPR]. By Schmidt's decomposition theorem [\cite=Schmidt], for every normalized 'bipartite' wave function [formula] there exist two orthogonal sets {ψn} and {φn} in [formula] and [formula] respectively, and a sequence of positive numbers {μn} satisfying [formula] so that

[formula]

Then, we define the 'entanglement' measure of 'bipartite' wave functions Ψ by

[formula]

It is easy to show that

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] Hence, S(Ψ) is the von Neumann's entropy of the reduced density matrix [formula] (or equivalently, [formula]) of |Ψ〉〈Ψ| (e.g., [\cite=BDSW]). In the sequel, we will show that S(Ψ) is a quantitative measure of complementarity between wave-like and particle-like behaviors.

Let us imagine a screen impermeable to electrons, in which two slits, 1 and 2, are cut. We denote by ψ1 the wave function of an electron through slit 1 with slit 2 being covered, and ψ2 the wave function of an electron through slit 2 with slit 1 being covered. Then, the state of a single electron through slits 1 and 2 can be described by a 'bipartite' wave function of form

[formula]

where a*ij  =  aji and |a11|2  +  |a12|2  +  |a21|2  +  |a22|2 = 1. As following are two special cases of Eq.(9):

[formula]

[formula]

Accordingly, ΨW corresponds to Schrödinger's wave function [formula] while there is no Schrödinger's wave function associated with ΨP. A single electron described by ΨW behaves like waves, while by ΨP like particles. This is so because for position, by (4) we have [formula] and [formula] respectively. Generally, for every Ψ of Eq.(9) one has

[formula]

When a single electron is described by Ψ, the larger is S(Ψ), more like particles it behaves [\cite=BSHMU]. Hence, S(Ψ) characterizes quantitatively wave-particle duality for a single particle.

Let ψn be the eigenfuncions of the Hamiltonian operator Ĥ, i.e., which satisfy the equation

[formula]

where En are the eigenvalues of Ĥ. Since [formula] is a complete orthogonal set in [formula] it is concluded that [formula] is a complete orthogonal set in [formula] Then, for every normalized 'bipartite' wave function [formula] there exists a unique set of numbers {cn,m} satisfying c*n,m  =  cm,n and [formula] so that

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Then, cn,m is the probabilistic amplitude of the transition of the particle from level ψn to ψm. The probability of getting Em on measurement in a state with 'bipartite' wave function Ψ is

[formula]

In this case, the collapse of Ψ to ψm can be regarded as the simultaneous transition of the particle from levels [formula] to ψm. The value of the associated change of energy of the system is

[formula]

Thus, our results suggest that von Neumann's collapse of Schrödinger's wave functions is just the simultaneous transition of the particle from many levels to one [\cite=vN]. We therefore conclude that there are two basic change for the system of a single particle, one is unitary, while the other is von Neumann's collapse in such a sense that the simultaneous transition of the particle from many levels (perhaps, only one) to one. The simultaneous transition should play a role in quantum measurement.

In conclusion, we show that 'bipartite' wave functions can present a mathematical formalism of quantum theory for a single particle. This extends Schrödinger's form of wave functions. It is presented a mathematical expression of wave-particle duality and that von Neumann's entropy is a quantitative measure of complementarity between wave-like and particle-like behaviors. Our formalism suggests that von Neumann's collapses of Schrödinger's wave functions is just the simultaneous transition of the particle from many levels to one. Our results shed considerable light on the basis of quantum mechanics, including quantum measurement.
