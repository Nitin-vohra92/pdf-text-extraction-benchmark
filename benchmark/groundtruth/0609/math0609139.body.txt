A generic characterization of direct summands for orthogonal involutions

Introduction

The 'transcendental methods' in the algebraic theory of quadratic forms are based on two major results, proved in the 60's by Cassels and Pfister, and known as the representation and the subform theorems (see [\cite=Sch] or [\cite=Lam2]). J.-P. Tignol gave in [\cite=T:96] a generalization of the representation theorem for algebras with involution (of any kind), which implies the corresponding statement for quadratic forms.

In this paper, the subform question is studied in the context of algebras with orthogonal involutions. The main results, which give partial answers to this question, are theorems [\ref=scai.theo] and [\ref=scaibis.theo], stated and proved in §[\ref=scai.sec] and §[\ref=scaibis.sec]. The first one gives a generic characterization of direct summands, which is valid for any algebra with orthogonal involution, but which is much weaker than the subform theorem in the split case. The second one is an analogue of the subform theorem, but only for division algebras and algebras of index at most 2. Before proving these theorems, we define in §[\ref=directsummands.sec] direct summands of an algebra with involution, using the direct sum of [\cite=D], and we restate the subform theorem in a convenient way for our purpose in §[\ref=subform.sec].

We assume throughout the paper that the base field F has characteristic different from 2, and refer the reader to [\cite=KMRT] for basic facts on algebras with involution.

Direct summands of an algebra with involution

Consider two central simple algebras with involution (B,τ) and (B',τ') over F, which are Morita equivalent, i.e. B and B' are Brauer equivalent and τ and τ' are of the same type. They can be represented as [formula] and [formula] for some hermitian modules (N,hN) and (N',hN') over a central division algebra with involution (D,γ) over F. The direct sum for hermitian modules gives rise to an algebra with involution, [formula], which is Morita equivalent to (B,τ) and (B',τ'). But the involutions τ and τ' only determine the hermitian forms hN and hN' up to a scalar factor, and modifying this factors independently may lead to a hermitian form which is not similar to [formula].

In [\cite=D], Dejaiffe defined a notion of direct sum for algebras with involution which extends direct sum of hermitian modules, i.e. such that [formula] is a direct sum of [formula] and [formula]. Precisely, given any Morita equivalence data between two algebras with involution (B,τ) and (B',τ') she defines the corresponding direct sum of (B,τ) and (B',τ'). Note that different Morita equivalence datas (which amount to modifying scalars as in the previous paragraph) may lead to non isomorphic direct sums of the same (B,τ) and (B',τ').

We say that (B,τ) is a direct summand of (A,σ) if there exist (B',τ'), Morita equivalent to (B,τ) and a direct sum of (B,τ) and (B',τ') which is isomorphic to (A,σ). By [\cite=D], this leads to the following definition: This condition can be translated in terms of hermitian modules as follows. Fix representations [formula] and [formula], for some hermitian modules over a central division algebra with orthogonal involution (D,γ) over F. Denote by M0  ⊂  M the image of the idempotent e, and by hM0 the restriction of hM to M0. The algebra with involution (eAe,σ|eAe) is [formula]. Hence, (B,τ) is a direct summand of (A,σ) if and only if M contains a submodule M0 such that hM0 is similar to hM.

In the split orthogonal case, that is [formula] and [formula], for some quadratic spaces (V,qV) and (W,qW) over F, we get that (B,τ) is a direct summand of (A,σ) if and only if there exists a scalar λ∈F× such that λqW is a subform of qV. A 'generic' condition under which this is satisfied is given by the subform theorem, at least in a version up to similarities. For further use, we give in the next section a projective version of this statement.

A projective version of the subform theorem up to similarities

Definition of qWproj

Denote by F(W) the function field of the affine variety W and by [formula] the field of rational functions on the projective variety [formula]. The generic point of the projective space [formula], viewed as an [formula] rational point, gives rise to a line [formula], which we call the generic line. We define the projective class of qW to be the square class in [formula] of the value of qW at any point of the generic line. It is a well defined element of [formula], and the notation [formula] stands for an element in [formula] who belongs to the projective class of qW.

If we identify [formula] with the subset F(W)0  ⊂  F(W) of degree 0 homogeneous functions, we may describe the projective class of qW as the quotient [formula], where qW is viewed as an element of F(W) and f is an arbitrary degree 1 homogeneous element so that the quotient is in F(W)0. The square class of [formula] clearly does not depend on the choice of f.

Let [formula] be any basis of W over F, with dual basis [formula], so that [formula]. We may then identify [formula] with [formula], where [formula] are indeterminates, by [formula]. Assume moreover that the basis [formula] is orthogonal for qW, and let bi  =  qW(ei). Using these identifications, one may check that the element [formula] belongs to the projective class of qW. Indeed, we have [formula], for [formula].

A projective version of the subform theorem up to similarities

The classical subform theorem ([\cite=Sch], [\cite=Lam2]) has the following easy consequence:

Let (V,qV) and (W,qW) be two quadratic spaces, with qV anisotropic. There exists λ∈F× such that λqW is a subform of qV if and only if

[formula]

Since [formula] represents [formula] (see §[\ref={q_W}proj.subsection]), condition ([\ref=dep]) clearly is necessary. Let us prove it is also sufficient. Pick a vector [formula] satisfying [formula]. If we identify [formula] with F(W) by [formula], we get [formula]. By the classical subform theorem, this implies that λqW is a subform of qV.

The generic ideal and a characterization of direct summands

We now go back to the setting of algebras with involution, and for simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the orthogonal case. Hence (A,σ) and (B,τ) are Brauer equivalent central simple algebras over F, with orthogonal involutions.

We denote by XB the Brauer-Severi variety of B and by FB the field of rational functions on XB. It is a generic splitting field for the algebra B. By definition of XB, its generic point, viewed as an FB-rational point, corresponds to a right ideal of reduced dimension 1 of the split algebra [formula]. We call it the generic ideal of B and denote it by IB. By [\cite=KMRT], given a representation [formula], there exists a unique line LB in the FB-vector space W such that [formula]; we call it the generic line of B.

If B is split and [formula] for some quadratic space (W,qW) over F, then XB is isomorphic to [formula], and with the notations of §, we have LB = LW and [formula].

In this section, we prove the following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition under which (A,σ) contains (B,τ) as a direct summand in terms of the generic ideal of B. Note that we do not view this as an analogue of the subform theorem (see remark [\ref=pasanalogue.rema] below). In particular, the involution σ may be isotropic.

Condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]) is clearly necessary. Indeed, if (B,τ) is a direct summand of (A,σ), there exist e∈A such that e2  =  σ(e) = e and an isomorphism of algebras with involution Ψ:  (eAe,σ|eAe)(B,τ). For any g∈IB  ⊂  BFB, the element f = ψ- 1FB(g) clearly satisfies the required condition.

We have to prove condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]) is also sufficient. Consider (A,σ) and (B,τ) as in the theorem, and take representations [formula] and [formula], for some hermitian modules over a central division algebra with orthogonal involution (D,γ) over F. Let M0  ⊂  M be the image of e, so that e is the orthogonal projection on M0. The isomorphim [formula] is given by some isomorphism of D-modules ψ:  M0N. Let us denote by hM0 the restriction of hM to M0. We will prove that hM0 is similar to hN, which in turn implies that (B,τ) is a direct summand of (A,σ).

Let [formula] be an orthogonal basis of (N,hN). The elements mk  =  ψ- 1(nk) for 1  ≤  k  ≤  s form a basis of the D-module M0. We will actually compute hM0 in this basis, using condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]).

Since A and D are Brauer equivalent to B, they both split over FB. Let (E,qγ) be a quadratic space over FB such that [formula]. By Morita theory, we then have (see for instance [\cite=BP])

[formula]

and similarly,

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, the involutions σ, τ and σ|eAe are respectively adjoint, after scalar extension to FB to the quadratic forms qV, qW and qV0 defined by

[formula]

and similarly for qW and qV0.

Let [formula] be an orthogonal basis of (E,qγ). We denote by di = hN(ni,ni) and aj = qγ(ej). The elements [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  s and 1  ≤  j  ≤  d form a basis of the FB vector space W. Let δ be any non trivial element in the generic line LB  ⊂  W defined at the beginning of this section.

The proof is based on the following computation, which the reader may easily check:

Consider the element g∈IB defined by [formula]. Then, τ(g)g maps [formula] to [formula].

For any couple 1  ≤  i  ≤  s and 1  ≤  j  ≤  d, let us first apply this lemma to the element gi,j∈IB which maps [formula] to δ, and any other element of the basis to 0, so that τ(gi,j)gi,j maps [formula] to [formula] and any other element of the basis to 0. Denote by fi,j the corresponding element of [formula] given by condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]). It satisfies

[formula]

from which we deduce that eσ(fi,j)fi,je maps [formula] to [formula] and any other element of the basis to 0. Now, we can compute

[formula]

for any [formula] and [formula] in two different ways. First, it is equal to

[formula]

By symmetry, it is also equal to [formula]

From this, we deduce that if [formula], then for any l,

[formula]

Hence (hM0(mk,mi)d- 1i)(ej) = 0. This is valid for any value of j, and we finally get

[formula]

Let us take now k = i. For any [formula], we have

[formula]

Since the basis [formula] is orthogonal for qγ, this implies that there exists an element λi,j∈F×B such that

[formula]

In other words, the element [formula] corresponds in the basis [formula] to the diagonal matrix with coefficients λi,j, 1  ≤  j  ≤  d.

Let us now prove that the coefficients λi,j are all equal. Consider the element gi∈IB which maps [formula] to δ for all [formula] and any other element of the basis to 0. Again by the previous lemma, τ(gi)gi maps [formula] to [formula] for any j, and any other element of the basis to 0. Let fi be the corresponding element of [formula] given by condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]). We get that eσ(fi)fie maps any [formula] to [formula]. The same computation as above for

[formula]

now gives λi,j  =  λi,l, which proves that hM0(mi,mi)d- 1i is actually central, hM0(mi,mi)d- 1i  =  λi∈F×B. Since we know from the very beginning it lies in [formula], λi actually belongs to F×.

To finish the proof, consider the element g∈IB which maps any element of the basis to δ. Then, τ(g)g maps any [formula] to

[formula]

Again, let f be the corresponding element of [formula] given by condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]). We get that eσ(f)fe maps any [formula] to

[formula]

Computing as before [formula] in two different ways, we get λi  =  λk  =  λ∈F×. Hence we have proven that

[formula]

and combined with [\ref=orthogonal.equa], this finishes the proof.

A subform theorem in some particular cases

Under some assumption on the algebra, we may improve the previous theorem. Note that conditions (ii) and (iii) in the following statement are direct consequences of condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]) of theorem [\ref=scai.theo]. Also, the involution σ now is supposed to be anisotropic.

Clearly, (i) implies (ii) and (ii) implies (iii). We now prove the theorem in the split and division cases. The index 2 case will be proven in § [\ref=ind2.sect].

The division case

In the particular case when B is a division algebra, there exists a unique left ideal of reduced dimension d, B itself, which is necessarily anisotropic. Hence conditions (ii) and (iii) in that case both reduce to condition ([\ref=algebra.cond]) of theorem [\ref=scai.theo]. This already proves the result is true if B is a division algebra. Note that the anisotropy hypothesis is not necessary in that case.

The split case

We assume now that A and B are split, and take representations [formula] and [formula]. The involution σ is anisotropic if and only if qV is anisotropic, and (A,σ) contains (B,τ) as a direct summand if and only if qV contains λqW as a subform for some λ∈F×.

Hence the theorem follows from the following proposition :

If A and B are split, then condition (iii) is equivalent to condition ([\ref=dep]) of Theorem [\ref=projectivesubform.theo].

Recall the isomorphism [formula] given by [formula]. It is an isomorphism of algebras with involution if we endow [formula] with the product [formula] and the involution [formula].

Under this isomorphism, a left ideal [formula] of reduced dimension 1 corresponds to [formula] for some non trivial w∈W, uniquely defined up to a scalar factor. Moreover, [formula] is anisotropic if and only if the vector w itself is anisotropic. On the other hand, after scalar extension to FB, the ideal IB corresponds under the same isomorphism to [formula].

Let us first assume (iii). Denote by V0 the image of the idempotent e. The isomorphims [formula] is given by Ψ(f) = ψfψ- 1, for some isomorphism ψ:  V0≃W.

Fix a vector w∈W such that [formula]. Any [formula] can be written as [formula] for some δ∈LB. We then have [formula]. Hence, τ(g)g maps w to qW(δ)qW(w)w, and any element of the orthogonal of w to 0.

Let us now consider the element v = ψ- 1(w)∈V0, and denote by f the element of [formula] corresponding to g given by condition (iii). We have

qV(f(v)) = qV(fe(v)) = bqV(eσ(f)feψ- 1(w),v) = bqV(ψ- 1(τ(g)g(w)),v)  =  qW(δ)qW(w)qV(v). This proves ([\ref=dep]) is satisfied. Indeed, we have already noticed in §[\ref=scai.sec] that qW(δ) belongs to the projective class of qW. On the other hand, v and w are both defined over F, w is anisotropic and qV is anisotropic. Hence qW(w)qV(v)∈F×.

Let us assume conversely that ([\ref=dep]) is satisfied, and let ν∈VFB be a vector satisfying qV(ν) = λqprojW  =  λqW(δ0) for some fixed non trivial δ0∈L. Specializing this equality, one may find anisotropic vectors w∈W and v∈V such that qV(v) = λqW(w). We let [formula] be an orthogonal basis of (V,qV) and [formula] be an orthogonal basis of (W,qW). Let V0  ⊂  V be the sub-vector space generated by [formula]. We define e to be the orthogonal projection on V0, ψ:  V0W the isomorphism defined by ψ(vi) = wi for [formula], and Ψ:  eAeB the isomorphism defined by Ψ(f) = ψfψ- 1.

Any element [formula] can be written as [formula] for some l∈FB. Take the corresponding element in AFB to be [formula]. We then have [formula] while [formula]. An easy computation shows that [formula]. Moreover, both maps are trivial on the orthogonal of w, since by definition of ψ, the image under ψ- 1 of the orthogonal of w is included in the orthogonal of v. Hence ψeσ(f)feψ- 1  =  τ(g)g, and this proves (iii).

Hermitian forms and the index 2 case

Before proving the theorem for algebras of index 2, we translate the conditions of theorem [\ref=scaibis.theo] in terms of hermitian forms.

Conditions (ii) and (iii) in terms of hermitian forms

Let (A,σ) and (B,τ) be two Brauer equivalent central simple algebras both endowed with an orthogonal involution. Fix representations [formula] and [formula] and let qV and qW denote as in §[\ref=scai.sec] the quadratic forms corresponding via Morita theory to the hermitian forms hMFB and hNFB. We denote by δ a fixed non zero element in the generic line LB.

The algebras with involution (A,σ) and (B,τ) satisfy condition (iii) if and only if there exists an anisotropic vector n∈N, a vector m∈M and a scalar λ∈F× such that hM(m) = λhN(n), and qV represents λqW(δ).

Let us assume first that (A,σ) and (B,τ) satisfy condition (iii). We use the computations made in the proof of theorem [\ref=scai.theo], and keep the same notations. Consider J, e and Ψ as given by condition (iii). We denote again by M0 the image of e and we let ψ:  M0M be an isomorphism such that Ψ(f) = ψfψ- 1 for any f∈A. As recalled in remark [\ref=ideal.rema], the ideal [formula] can be written as [formula], for some anisotropic vector n∈N. Define m to be m = ψ- 1(n). Since n is anisotropic, we may choose an orthogonal basis [formula] of (N,hN) over D such that n1 = n. One may then easily check that the elements g1,j and g1 defined in the proof of theorem [\ref=scai.theo] belongs to [formula], and condition (iii) proves the existence of corresponding elements f1,j and f1 in AFB. By the computations made in the proof of theorem [\ref=scai.theo] we get that hM(m) = λhN(n) for some λ∈F×.

Moreover, if we let [formula], equation ([\ref=q(nu).equa]) proves that [formula].

Let us now prove the converse. Since n is anisotropic, there exists orthogonal basis [formula] of M and [formula] of N such that n1 = n and m1 = m. We let J be [formula], and take e to be the orthogonal projection on the submodule M0 of M generated by [formula] and ψ to be the isomorphism ψ:  M0N given by ψ(mi) = ni.

Any endomorphism [formula] is defined by

[formula]

We then define [formula] by

[formula]

where ν∈V satisfies qV(ν) = λqW(δ). As in lemma [\ref=tau(g)g.lemm], one may check that

[formula]

[formula]

Hence we get

[formula]

[formula]

which by lemma [\ref=tau(g)g.lemm] implies ψeσ(f)feψ- 1  =  τ(g)g and hence finishes the proof.

From the previous proposition and the correspondence between left ideals J of reduced dimension D such that τ(J) is anisotropic and anisotropic vectors in (N,hN) recalled in remark [\ref=ideal.rema], we deduce a translation of condition (ii) in terms of hermitian forms:

Proof of theorem [\ref=scaibis.theo] in the index 2 case

The theorem in the index 2 case now follows from the following proposition :

Let (D,γ) be a division algebra of index at most 2 with orthogonal involution and (M,hM) and (N,hN) two hermitian forms over (D,γ), with hM anisotropic. Then hM contains hN as a subform if and only if qV represents qW(δ).

If D is split, this statement is the projective version of the classical subform theorem which is already known. Hence we assume D is a division quaternion algebra. The condition is clearly necessary.

To prove it also is sufficient, let us first extend scalars to FD, so that the situation is split. By a result due both to I. Dejaiffe [\cite=Dej:01] and Parimala-Sridharan-Suresh [\cite=PSS], we know that the involution σ remains anisotropic after scalar extension to FD, so that the quadratic form qV is anisotropic. Hence we can apply the subform theorem to qV and qW. Since the generic point of a variety maps under scalar extension to the generic point of the extended variety, the condition implies that [formula] represents qWproj, and hence qV contains qW as a subform. By Morita equivalence, this precisely means that (hM)FD contains (hN)FD as a subform, and it only remains to go down using the injectivity of the natural map from the Witt group of D to the Witt group of FD and the excellence result of [\cite=PSS]
