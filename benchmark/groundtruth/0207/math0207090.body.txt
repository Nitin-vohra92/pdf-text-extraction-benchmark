Introduction

We shall address here the question of how the important concepts of topological transitivity and ergodicity (metric transitivity) are related. It is easy to verify that if m: =  Lebesgue measure is ergodic or f preserves any ergodic probability measure which gives a positive mass to open balls, then f is topologically transitive. That is, there exists a point x∈M such that its orbit is dense, or for any two open sets U and V, there exists [formula] such that [formula].

On the other hand, we know that the converse implication is not true i.e transitivity is not enough to garante ergodicity. In fact, by an example of Furstenberg, we even know minimal and non-ergodic diffeomorphism.

Although transitivity and ergodicity are different notions (topological and metric), we want to relate them when they persist in a neighbourhood of a diffeomorphism. To obtain ergodic results we need more regularity, for instance Hölder continuity for the derivative of the diffeomorphism is generally a necessary condition for proving ergodicity. It is relevant to remember that even for C1 Anosov diffeomorphisms preserving volume, the ergodicity is not verified.

Let us define [formula] and prove ergodicity results in this set. A Df-invariant splitting [formula] of TM is called dominated splitting if the fibers of the bundles have constant dimension on whole manifold and there is λ  <  1 such that:

[formula]

In [\cite=BDP] the authors show that every C1  -  robustly transitive diffeomorphism has dominated splitting. More precisely for C1-robustly transitive diffeomorphisms, [formula] and this decomposition is dominated, moreover Df behaves "hyperbolic" for volume in E1,Ek, more precisely for some C  >  0 :

[formula]

[formula]

As for surface diffeomorphisms, E1 and Ek are one dimensional, C1-robust transitivity implies a global hyperbolic structure or in other word, robustly transitive diffeomorphisms are Anosov. Robustly transitive diffeomorphisms defined on three-manifolds may be non-Anosov. In this case the tangent bundle of the ambient manifold can be split in the following ways:

[formula] where Eu is uniformly expanding one dimensional and Ecs can not be split in whole manifold and it is "volume contracting":

[formula]

[formula]

[formula], three subbundles are nontrivial and Ec is not uniformly hyperbolic. This case is called strongly partially hyperbolic.

Let PHr(M) (resp. PHrm(M)) be the set of Cr-partially hyperbolic (resp. conservative partially hyperbolic) diffeomorphisms. The following questions are of interest :

Let [formula] be C1-robustly transitive. May f be approximated by robustly ergodic diffeomorphisms, or even is it true that any robustly transitive diffeomorphism is robustly ergodic ?

In the surface diffeomorphisms case, robust transitivity diffeomorphisms are Anosov and it is well known that conservative Anosov diffeomorphisms are robustly ergodic [\cite=An67]. So, there is a positive answer to the above question in dimension 2. For strongly partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of three dimensional manifolds, Dolgopyat [\cite=Do2] has shown that stably ergodic systems are dense. An important thing is to remove zero Lyapunov exponent in the central direction.

Although all known examples of robustly transitive diffeomorphisms have nonzero Lyapunov exponents, it is more reasonable to ask the following:

May one approximate any robustly transitive diffeomorphism by another whose Lyapunov exponents are nonzero in a full Lebesgue measure set.

Absolute continuity of stable and unstable foliations for the non-uniformly hyperbolic C1  +  αdiffeomorphisms is the main ingredient to prove ergodicity in majority of cases. We remark that a C1  +  α assumption on f is needed to get the absolute continuity of the invariant foliations, for an example of non-absolute continuous foliation in C1-Anosov case see  [\cite=RY90].

The hypothesis about Lyapunov exponents in the above theorem is also called "mostly contracting". Mostly expanding is defined similarly and the theorem is true for them too. The main point in the above theorem is that for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms the invariant foliations tangent to hyperbolic directions are continuous.

In Theorem[\ref=partial], all the Lyapunov exponents in the central direction are of the same sign. If this does not happen, that is if there exists directions corresponding to the positive Lyapunov exponents which do not dominate directions corresponding to negative Lyapunov exponents, we can not get the same results. For these cases we prove that any robustly transitive diffeomorphism of three dimensional manifold is approximated by almost robustly ergodic ones. We use a new result of Bochi-Viana which shows dominated splitting for Oseledets decomposition of C1 generic conservative diffeomorphisms. Let us define almost robust ergodicity :

By the above definition of almost-robust ergodicity of f we require that perturbing a little f, with a large enough probability, the Birkhoff averages of continuous function are the same. In other words the ergodicity near f is " getting better". It is clear by definition that if [formula] is almost-robustly ergodic, then f is ergodic. As a corollary:

The ergodic diffeomorphisms constitute a generic subset of [formula], with the C1 induced topology, if [formula] is dense in U.

The density hypothesis in the above corollary is very natural. In fact, in the symplectic case it is proved that C∞ symplectic diffeomorphisms are dense in C1 ones [\cite=Ze77]. For conservative diffeomorphisms it is an open question yet. We mention here that another interesting question for robustly ergodic diffeomorphisms is the following:

Is it true that any C1-robustly ergodic conservative diffeomorphism admits a dominated splitting?

For more than three dimensional case in [\cite=BoV00], the authors give the first example of robustly transitive diffeomorphisms of [formula] which do not have any hyperbolic direction and in [\cite=T02] we show the robust ergodicity of such diffeomorphisms. In fact, the robust ergodicity of a class of diffomorphisms of [formula], which do not have any hyperbolic direction is verified.

Preliminary

Let f:M  →  M be a C1  +  α diffeomorphism of a compact manifold that preserves volume m. Oseledets theorem  [\cite=Os68] states that, for m - almost every point x∈M, there exists real numbers [formula] and

[formula]

such that

[formula]

λj's are Lyapunov exponents which depends measurably on x.

Let us mention that for a general C1  +  α diffeomorphism preserving an smooth hyperbolic measure (with nonzero Lyapunov exponents) one has a countable number of ergodic components [\cite=Pe77]. Dolgopyat, Hu and Pesin constructed an example of such diffeomorphism with infinitely many open ergodic components. It is obvious that such examples can not be topologically transitive because open invariant sets are dense in transitive case, so there would exist just one ergodic component. We are going to show ergodicity by finding open sets (mod 0) in the ergodic components of Lebesgue measure. This kind of approach to prove ergodicity was introduced by Pesin [\cite=Pe77]. The idea is to show local ergodicity (ergodic components are open sets, a.e) and then by the aid of topological transitivity we get ergodicity. Observe that to prove ergodicity or equivalently the existence of a unique ergodic component, we just need to show that any ergodic component contains an open set (mod 0) and then use the transitivity as following :

If C1,C2 are two ergodic component with U1  ⊂  C1, U2  ⊂  C2 (mod 0), i.e [formula] then by topological transitivity [formula] such that [formula]. By the invariance of Ci and the fact that f is diffeomorphism and and preserve the measure m, it comes out that [formula] and C1  =  C2.

(Theorem 1)

Let f∈U be as in Theorem [\ref=partial], where [formula] constitutes of transitive diffeomorphims with non-zero Lyapunov exponents in a full Lebesgue measure set. As m is an invariant measure with non-zero Lyapunov exponents, it has a countable number of ergodic components which are just the normalization of its restriction to Ci where each Ci is a measurable invariant subsets with m(Ci)  >  0 which we call them also by ergodic components.

By continuity of the invariant foliations of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in [\cite=HPS77], the unstable foliation of g∈U varies continuously. Using Pesin theory for [formula], there is a full Lebesgue measure subset R such that x∈R is regular in the following sense.

[formula]

For any x∈R there is a local stable manifold Wsloc(x) which depend measurably on x. Moreover the stable foliation is absolutely continuous. For any ergodic component C, there is x∈C such that Wsloc(x) is almost (With respect to Lebesgue measure of Ws(x)) contained in [formula]. That means, there exists [formula], for some ε  >  0, such that [formula] where ms is the Lebesgue measure induced on the stable manifold. Now we saturate Cx by unstable leaves and let [formula]. By continuity of unstable foliation, Ux will contain an open set. On the other hand by Hopf's argument for any y∈Cx and z∈Wu(y) we have:

[formula]

[formula]

Now by absolute continuity of Wu (unstable foliation) we conclude that [formula] has full measure in Ux and finally as regular points have full measure, the ergodic component C contains a total Lebesgue measure subset of the open set Ux. This is what we want because ergodic components are invariant and f is transitive and this proves the uniqueness of ergodic components with positive Lebesgue measure and consequently ergodicity of the Lebesgue measure.

We mention that, only absolute continuity of Wu is not enough to get an open set (mod 0) in the above argument, but if we have some control from below on the size of local unstable manifolds of y∈Wslocal(x) then the same argument works. The problem in Theorem [\ref=almost] appears when in some ergodic component with positive measure, a direction corresponding to a positive Lyapunov exponent does not dominate the direction corresponding to the negative one. More precisely let [formula] and λ1(x)  >  λ2(x)  >  λ3(x) represent the Lyapunov exponents. It may happen that for an ergodic component C with m(C)  >  0, λ2  >  0 and Ecs can not be split into one dimensional dominating subbundles over C.

We show that the measure of such bad behaved set is small enough for diffeomorphisms near to C1-generic diffeomorphisms for which almost everywhere the Oseledets splitting is dominated.

Dominated splitting of Oseledet splitting

Now let recall the new result of Bochi-Viana [\cite=BoV02] that gives a C1 generic subset of diffeomorphisms for which the Oseledet decomposition is dominated or trivial. Let us define [formula], where [formula]. By semi-continuity arguments it is easy to show that the continuity points of [formula] contains a C1-residual subset [formula]. In [\cite=BoV02] the authors show that [formula], the Oseledet splitting is dominated or trivial. We show that diffeomorphisms near to this generic subset have greedy ergodic components. (of Theorem [\ref=almost]) Let [formula] be the decomposition of tangent bundle for the diffeomorphisms in U.(the other cases are similar.) Take any [formula], where R is the residual subset in Theorem [\ref=dichotomy]. As g is a continuity point of Λ above, for small δ0  >  0 there exists O, a C1 neighbourhood of g in [formula] such that [formula], |Λi(f1)  -  Λi(f)|  <  δ0. As Lyapunov exponents of f∈U are nonzero then by [\cite=Pe77], m has a countable number of ergodic components Cn with m(Cn)  >  0 and [formula]. Now let [formula]; we will show that f has a large ergodic component in the measure theoretic sense.

Any ergodic component C is an invariant set and mC:= the normalized restriction of the Lebesgue measure on C is an ergodic measure for the restriction of f on C. Neglecting zero measure subsets which are irrelevant for our purposes, we may substitute C by Supp(mC). Now we claim that there exists   ⊆  C such that [formula] and any x∈ has a dense orbit in C. To show the above claim remember that by the ergodicity of mC, the basin of mC has full measure. The basin consists of points z such that [formula] converges to mC. As mC has a full support, the orbit of the points in the basin will be dense in C. Now it is enough to take   =   Basin of mC and the claim is proved. In the following we define two kinds of ergodic components:

Cgood  =   Union of ergodic components Ci such that one of the followings happens:

λ2(x)  <  0 for x∈Ci

[formula] is a dominated splitting on Ci and λ2(x)  >  0.

of course for each ergodic component at most one of the above items can be satisfied.

Cbad= Complement of Cgood

By the arguments in the previous section in the proof of Theorem [\ref=partial] we deduce that all Ci  ⊂  Cgood contains open set (mod 0), because:

If λ2(x)  <  0 then we are in the setting of Theorem [\ref=partial]. Firstly we use absolute continuity of local stable manifolds corresponding to λ2 and λ3 and then continuity of unstable foliation tangent to Eu.

If λ2(x) = λ  >  0 and E2 dominates E3, then on the corresponding ergodic component Ci, the tangent bundle has the following invariant dominated decomposition: [formula] with dim (Ecs)  =  1 and [formula] where E2 corresponds to λ2. Now as f is conservative it is easy to show that the above dominated splitting has the volume hyperbolicity property: | det (Dfn|Ecs(x)|  ≤  Cλn for some C  >  0,λ  <  1 for any x∈Ci (see [\cite=BDP] for volume hyperbolicity of dominated splitting in the coservative case). As Ecs is one dimensional, the volume hyperbolicity is equivalent to uniform hyperbolicity. Now apply the same argument of the Theorem [\ref=partial] using the absolute continuity of the local unstable manifolds for the points in Ci and the existence of large stable manifolds which is a result of uniform hyperbolicity of Ecs.

Consequently by topological transitivity, there is just one egodic component in Cgood. For the bad components we prove that they occupy an small region in the measure theoretic sense. Let us fix some notations. By an m - dominated splitting of [formula] along the orbit of a point x we require that for all [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula]. By an m - dominated splitting over an invariant set C we mean m - dominated splitting for all orbits in C. Observe that m - dominated splitting extends to the closure of an invariant subset.

Let Γ(f,m) denotes the subset of points such that [formula] does not admit an m - dominated splitting and let [formula]. For the ergodic components C  ⊆  Cbad, λ2  >  0 and [formula] does not admit an m - dominated splitting over C for any [formula]. We claim that, there exits a full mC measure subset of C which we denote it also by C, such that C  ⊆  Γ(f,  ∞  ). To prove the claim observe that as m - dominated splitting passes to closure of sets, for any point x∈ (z∈ has dense orbit) there is not any m - dominated splitting of [formula] along the orbit of x. This shows that Cbad  ⊆  Γ(f,  ∞  ) (mod 0).

Denote

[formula]

We apply the following proposition of [\cite=BoV02]: By the above proposition we will deduce that if the measure of bad components is not small enough then after perturbing f a little, the average of λ1  +  λ2 drastically drops.

As Cbad  ⊆  Γ(f,  ∞  ) and on Cbad,λ2(x)  >  0 by the above proposition it turns out that

[formula]

[formula]

Now we observe that the infimum above is bounded away from zero uniformly in O.

There is some α  <  1, depending only to g such that: λ3(x)  ≤   log (α) for all x∈Cbad.

As g is volume hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic [formula], so  det (Df|Ecs(x))  <  α  <  1 for all x∈M and we can take α uniform in a C1 neighborhood of g, just because g  →  Ecs(x,g) is continuous for C1 topology in the partially hyperbolic space. Take x∈Cbad then:

[formula]

and as λ2(x)  >  0 we have λ3(x)  <   log (α).

So by the above lemma:

[formula]

and

[formula]

We get then [formula]. Taking δ0 and δ small, for [formula] is small enough and so m(Cgood) is large and "ergodicity is getting better".

Finally we conclude The Corollary  [\ref=generic] as follows. Taking [formula]-ergodic diffeomorphisms in [formula], then En is open and dense in the C1 induced topology , so [formula] is a residual subset and f∈E is ergodic.
