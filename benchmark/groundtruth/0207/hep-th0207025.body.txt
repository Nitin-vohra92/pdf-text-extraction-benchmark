In ref. [\cite=Ho], Chong-Sun Chu and Pei-Ming Ho have studied the constraint quantization of open string in background B field. They have obtained an infinite set of secondary constraints due to the boundary conditions for the open string on D-brane. Then, they have shown that the Dirac brackets result in the non-commutativity algebra derived in ref. [\cite=Ho1] for the end points of the open string and consequently the D-brane becomes non-commutative. This result is very interesting because, as far as we know, this is one of the most important applications of the Dirac method of quantization of the secondary constraints [\cite=Dirac]. Here, we show that the Dirac method does not lead to an infinite set of secondary constraints but to a set of finite second class constraint chains which does not lead to the non-commutativity algebra.

The action for an open string ending on a Dp-brane is [\cite=Ho] [\cite=Ho1]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the modified Born-Infeld field strength. The equation of motion is

[formula]

and the boundary conditions at σ = 0,π are:

[formula]

In the following, for simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume the case p = D. Defining the momentum fields

[formula]

then the Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where [formula], [formula]'s are Lagrange multipliers and [formula]'s are the primary constraints corresponding to the boundary conditions given in Eq.([\ref=a2]) [\cite=Ho] [\cite=She]:

[formula]

in which

[formula]

The secondary constraints can be obtained by considering the consistency conditions of the primary constraints:

[formula]

where

[formula]

This result is the direct consequence of the fact that (see Eq.(28) in ref.[\cite=Ho]),

[formula]

and consequently,

[formula]

To obtain the final result given in Eq.([\ref=a4]) we have used the following properties:

[formula]

Since

[formula]

the constraints [formula]'s and [formula]'s form a set of secondary constraints [\cite=Ho] [\cite=She]. Consequently the consistency of the secondary constraints [formula]'s determine the Lagrange multiplier and according to the well known arguments in the context of constrained systems, no additional constraint emerges. To calculate the Dirac brackets, it is suitable to define constraints

[formula]

for σ = 0,π, where ωa's are defined as follows:

[formula]

The matrix of the Poisson brackets of the constraints Ωa0's is

[formula]

Using the equality

[formula]

the inverse of the matrix C can be obtained as follows:

[formula]

By definition, the Dirac bracket of the fields Xi(τ,0) is:

[formula]

where σ1 = 0 and σ2  =  π.

Consequently the Dirac method of constraint quantization leads to a commutative Poisson structure for D-branes to which the open string end points are attached [\cite=He]. Finally it is necessary to note that the final result given in Eq.([\ref=b]) does not change if one insists on the assertion that an infinite set of constraints exist on the boundaries [\cite=She].
