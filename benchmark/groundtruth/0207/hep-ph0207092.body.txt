Δ  →  Nγ in Large-Nc QCD

One of the mysteries in hadronic physics is the success of the non-relativistic quark model in describing the structure and spectrum of the low-lying baryons. In the non-relativistic quark model, the spin structure of baryons is determined entirely by the spin of the constituent quarks, in clear contradiction to the result from polarized deep-inelastic scattering that only 20-30% of the nucleon spin is carried by the spin of the quarks [\cite=filippone]. Nevertheless, the non-relativistic quark model successfully predicts that the ratio of the neutron to proton magnetic moments is - 2 / 3 and that the Δ to N electromagnetic transition is dominated by the M1 multipole. Recent advances in studying baryons in the 1 / Nc expansion of QCD help to reconcile the success of the quark model predictions with the spin structure of the nucleon [\cite=rev1] [\cite=rev2] [\cite=dmj] [\cite=djm].

The large-Nc limit of QCD validates many of the quark model spin-flavor symmetry results without assuming a non-relativistic quark dynamics for the baryon wave functions. An SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry of baryons was derived in the large-Nc limit, which yields the same spin-flavor results as the non-relativistic quark model and Skyrme model without making any of the dynamical assumptions of these models. In the 1 / Nc expansion of QCD, the ratio of the neutron and proton magnetic moments is predicted to be - 2 / 3 up to a correction of order 1 / N2c [\cite=rev1] [\cite=rev2] [\cite=dmj] [\cite=djm]. Likewise, it is shown in this paper that the E2/M1 electromagnetic transition ratio between Δ and N is of order 1 / N2c. This result requires no assumption about the underlying quark orbital angular momentum, or intrinsic deformation, of the baryon.

The radiative decay Δ+  →  pγ is described by two independent amplitudes. The standard convention [\cite=PDG] is to use helicity amplitudes A1 / 2 and A3 / 2, which are the amplitudes for a Δ+ state with helicity 1 / 2 or 3 / 2 along its direction of motion to decay to a right-handed photon moving along this same direction, and a proton recoiling in the opposite direction. The helicity amplitudes for Δ+ decay to a left-handed photon are related to A1 / 2 and A3 / 2 by parity conservation of the strong and electromagnetic interactions. The total decay rate for Δ+  →  pγ is given by

[formula]

where kγ = 259 MeV is the momentum of the photon, Mp is the proton mass, MΔ is the Δ+ mass, and J = 3 / 2 is the spin of the Δ+. Eq. ([\ref=100]) adheres to the normalization convention of the helicity amplitudes used by the Particle Data Group [\cite=PDG]. The experimental values for the helicity amplitudes are

[formula]

which yield the ratio

[formula]

In this paper, we show that the large-Nc prediction for this ratio is

[formula]

in good agreement with the experimental result.

The Δ+  →  pγ also can be described using a multipole expansion. The only multipoles which contribute are the magnetic moment (M1) and the electric quadrupole (E2). These multipoles are related to the helicity amplitudes by [\cite=PDG]

[formula]

The total decay rate Γ in Eq. ([\ref=100]) depends on

[formula]

The experimental value for the ratio E2 / M1 is

[formula]

We show that the large-Nc prediction for E2 / M1,

[formula]

is equivalent to the prediction Eq. ([\ref=400]) for the ratio of helicity amplitudes. The experimental measurement Eq. ([\ref=600]) is consistent with the prediction that E2 / M1 is order 1 / N2c.

The large-Nc expansion for baryons gives an expansion in powers of 1 / Nc for operators with definite spin and flavor transformation properties [\cite=dmj] [\cite=djm] [\cite=lm] [\cite=cgo]. In the Nc  →    ∞   limit, the baryons are infinitely heavy and can be treated as static [\cite=jm], with recoil effects included as 1 / Nc corrections [\cite=prm]. The static kinematics of the large-Nc limit makes it natural to use large-Nc methods to evaluate the multipole amplitudes, rather than the helicity amplitudes.

The Δ+  →  pγ transition is an I = 3 / 2  →  I = 1 / 2 transition mediated by the isovector part of the electromagnetic current. The isovector electromagnetic current operator can be expanded in powers of the photon momentum (the multipole expansion), and is proportional to

[formula]

where i and j = 1,2,3 are vector spin indices, and a = 1,2,3 is a vector isospin index. In Eq. ([\ref=710]), μia is the magnetic moment operator, which is an (J,I) = (1,1) operator, and Q(ij)a is the quadrupole moment operator, which is an (J,I) = (2,1) operator. The quadrupole operator Q(ij)a is a symmetric, traceless tensor in spin indices i and j. The M1 and E2 amplitudes are related to the matrix elements of the magnetic moment and quadrupole moment operators through

[formula]

where μz  =  μia for i = 3,a = 3, and Q20 is the [formula] component of Q(ij)a for a = 3.

As shown in the above equation, the M1 amplitude for Δ+  →  pγ is proportional to the matrix element of the (J,I) = (1,1) operator μia between Δ+ and p. In the Nc  →    ∞   limit, the states Δ+ and p are both contained in the lowest-lying baryon spin-flavor multiplet consisting of baryons with J = I. The isovector magnetic moment operator has a 1 / Nc expansion in terms of operator products of the baryon SU(4) spin-flavor generators Gia, Ia and Ji. Each independent operator polynomial arises at a definite order in the 1 / Nc expansion which is determined by its explicit factor of 1 / Nc and the implicit Nc-dependence of its operator matrix elements. The 1 / Nc expansion of the magnetic moment operator is given by

[formula]

where the coefficients μ1, μ2, μ3, [formula] have an expansion in 1 / Nc beginning at order unity, and the ellipsis represents higher-body operators. The complete set of higher-body operators are of the form [formula] where O1  =  Gia and O2  =  JiIa. At leading order in 1 / Nc, the 1 / Nc expansion of the magnetic moment operator can be truncated to the single operator μ1Gia. This truncation of the 1 / Nc expansion yields the spin-flavor symmetry relation between the Δ+  →  pγ transition moment and the isovector combination of the p and n magnetic moments [\cite=magmom],

[formula]

The matrix elements of the spin-flavor generator Gia are of order Nc, so the transition magnetic moment matrix element for Δ+  →  pγ is order Nc. This power counting is in accordance with the I = J rule [\cite=ijrule] [\cite=ij1nrule]. Note that the M1 amplitude is only order [formula] when ignoring an Nc-counting for the electromagnetic coupling e, since the kinematic factor [formula] in the definition Eq. ([\ref=m1e2def]) gives a suppression factor of [formula]. The leading 1 / Nc corrections to Eq. ([\ref=900]) are produced by the JiIa / Nc and [formula] operators which both yield corrections of order 1 / N2c relative to the leading order Nc contribution since the matrix elements of the baryon spin-flavor generators obey the Nc power counting G  ~  Nc, I  ~  1 and J  ~  1.

Since the 1 / Nc expansion of the isovector magnetic moment is given by a unique operator Gia to relative order 1 / N2c and, as we will show, the E2 amplitude is order 1 / N2c relative to the M1 amplitude, the ratio of the helicity amplitudes A3 / 2 / A1 / 2 is predicted at leading order in the 1 / Nc expansion. The value of the prediction is given in Eq. ([\ref=400]). It is straightforward to show that all higher order terms in the 1 / Nc expansion of the M1 amplitude Eq. ([\ref=800]) do not affect the ratio A3 / 2 / A1 / 2, although they do violate the SU(4) symmetry relation Eq. ([\ref=900]).

The E2 amplitude for Δ+  →  pγ is proportional to the matrix element of the (J,I) = (2,1) operator Q(ij)akjγ between Δ+ and p. The E2 amplitude has one additional power of the photon momentum kγ relative to the M1 amplitude. Since the mass difference between Δ+ and p is order 1 / Nc, kγ is order 1 / Nc. This kinematic suppression of E2 / M1 by one power of 1 / Nc is not sufficient to explain the smallness of the measured ratio, Eq. ([\ref=600]). However, there is an additional 1 / Nc suppression beyond the kinematic suppression due to kγ. The electric quadrupole amplitude is proportional to the matrix element of the (J,I) = (2,1) operator Q(ij)a between Δ+ and p. The quadrupole moment operator has the 1 / Nc expansion

[formula]

where the operator [formula] is understood to have its trace subtracted, c1 is an operator coefficient of order unity, and qu and qd are the u and d quark charges. The electric quadrupole operator Q(ij)a has matrix elements of order unity at leading order, since the matrix elements of the baryon spin-flavor generators obey the Nc power counting G  ~  Nc, I  ~  1 and J  ~  1. This 1 / Nc suppression is in accordance with the suppression of [formula] operators by [formula], as derived in [\cite=ij1nrule], since |J - I|  =  1 for the quadrupole operator. Thus E2 is order (1 / Nc)3 / 2 due to the factor of (1 / Nc)3 / 2 from k3 / 2γ in Eq. ([\ref=m1e2def]), and E2 / M1 is of order 1 / N2c since M1 is order [formula].

Note that the isoscalar quadrupole operator has the expansion,

[formula]

where c0 is of order unity. Since the matrix element of Gia is of order Nc and of Ji is of order unity, the ratio of the isoscalar to isovector quadrupole moments is of order 1 / Nc times (qu + qd) / (qu - qd). If one assumes that qu = 2 / 3 and qd =  - 1 / 3, then (qu + qd) / (qu - qd) = 1 / 3 and the ratio of the the isoscalar to isovector quadrupole moments is order 1 / Nc. If, as in Ref. [\cite=bhl], one chooses qu = (Nc + 1) / (2Nc), and qd = (1 - Nc) / (2Nc), then (qu + qd) / (qu - qd) = 1 / Nc and the ratio of the isoscalar to isovector quadrupole moments is order 1 / N2c, in agreement with Ref. [\cite=bhl].

One concrete realization of the large-Nc spin-flavor symmetry of baryons in QCD is given by the Skyrme model. Thus, the Skyrme model can be used as an explicit check of the general, model-independent large-Nc results. For instance, the Skyrme model predicts that the transition magnetic moment [formula], where the isovector magnetic moment is proportional to f- 1πe- 3, and e is the coefficient of the Skyrme term. Since [formula] and [formula] , the transition magnetic moment scales like Nc [\cite=anw]. Likewise, the Skyrme model predicts the transition quadrupole moment [formula]. Although the nucleon isovector charge radius 〈r2〉I = 1 diverges in the chiral limit, it is independent of Nc in the large-Nc limit. Therefore QΔN is of order N0c [\cite=an].

One can also apply the large-Nc counting rules to the charge radii. For the isovector charge radii, we have the expansion

[formula]

where a1 is a coefficient of order unity. Thus 〈r2〉I = 1 is of order N0c, consistent with the Skyrme model prediction. For the isoscalar charge radii,

[formula]

where a0 is a coefficient of order unity. The ratio of the isoscalar to isovector charge radii is of order Nc(qu + qd) / (qu - qd), in agreement with Ref. [\cite=bl]. The above results also are consistent with the picture that the baryon radius is of order N0c in the large-Nc limit. The charge radius 〈r2〉 for a quark is of order unity. The isoscalar charge radius is the sum of 〈r2〉 over Nc quarks, and is of order Nc, whereas the isovector charge radius is the sum of 〈r2〉 over the (Nc + 1) / 2 u-quarks minus the sum of 〈r2〉 over the (Nc - 1) / 2 d-quarks. The order Nc pieces cancels in the difference, so the isovector charge radius is order one.
