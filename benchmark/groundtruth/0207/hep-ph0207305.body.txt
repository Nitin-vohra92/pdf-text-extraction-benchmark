Antishadowing and multiparticle production

Introduction

Multiparticle production and global observables such as mean multiplicity and its energy dependence alongside with total, elastic and inelastic cross-sections provide us a clue to the mechanisms of confinement and hadronization. General principles are very important in the nonperturbative sector, in particular, unitarity which regulates the relative strength of elastic and inelastic processes. Unfortunately, there are no universal, generally accepted methods to implement unitarity in high energy scattering. Related problem of absorptive corrections and their sign has a long history (cf. [\cite=sachbla]) and references therein).

The choice of particular unitarization scheme is not completely a matter of taste. Long time ago the arguments based on analytical properties of the scattering amplitude were put forward [\cite=blan] in favor of the rational form of unitarization. It was shown that correct analytical properties of the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane can be reproduced much easier in this form of unitarization compared to the most popular exponential form. Besides that rational form of unitarization leads naturally to prediction of the antishadow scattering mode [\cite=bdsphl]. Appearance of this mode is expected beyond the Tevatron maximum energy.

Interest in unitarity and the corresponding limitations was stimulated under preparation of the experimental program at the LHC and the future plans to study soft interactions at the highest energies. Indeed, correct account for unitarity is also essential under theoretical estimates of the Higgs production cross-section via the diffractive mechanisms. The region of the LHC energies is the one where antishadow scattering mode is to be presented. It has been demonstrated that this mode can be revealed at the LHC directly measuring σel(s) and σtot(s) [\cite=reltot] and not only through the analysis of impact parameter distributions. Antishadowing leads to self-damping of the inelastic channels and dominating role of elastic scattering, i. e. σel(s)  /  σtot(s)  →  1 at s  →    ∞  . Natural question arises about consistency of this mechanism with the growth with energy of mean multiplicity in hadronic collisions. Moreover, many models and experimental data suggest power dependence on energy of mean multiplicity and a priori it is not evident whether such dependence is compatible with antishadowing or not.

In this note we apply the rational (U-matrix) unitarization approach [\cite=umat] for consideration of the global features of multiparticle dynamics such as mean multiplicity and role of absorptive correction. We show that it is possible to reproduce power-like energy behavior of the mean multiplicity in the model with antishadowing and discuss its physical implications.

Multiparticle production in the U-matrix approach

The rational form of unitarization is based on the relativistic generalization of the Heitler equation of radiation dumping [\cite=umat]. In this approach the elastic scattering amplitude satisfies unitarity equation since it is a solution of the following equation

[formula]

presented here in the operator form. Eq.[\ref=xx] allows one to satisfy unitarity provided the inequality

[formula]

is fulfilled. The form of the amplitude in the impact parameter representation is the following:

[formula]

where U(s,b) is the generalized reaction matrix, which is considered as an input dynamical quantity similar to the eikonal function. Analogous form for the scattering amplitude was obtained by Feynman in his parton model of diffractive scattering [\cite=ravn].

In the impact parameter representation the unitarity equation rewritten for the elastic scattering amplitude f(s,b) at high energies has the form

[formula]

where the inelastic overlap function

[formula]

is the sum of all inelastic channel contributions. It can be expressed as a sum of n-particle production cross-sections at the given impact parameter

[formula]

where

[formula]

Inelastic overlap function is related to U(s,b) as follows

[formula]

Then the unitarity Eq. [\ref=unt] points out that the elastic scattering amplitude at given impact parameter value is determined by the inelastic processes when the amplitude is a pure imaginary one. Eq. [\ref=unt] imply the constraint |f(s,b)|  ≤  1 while the "black disk" limit presumes inequality |f(s,b)|  ≤  1 / 2 and the elastic amplitude satisfying this condition is a shadow of inelastic processes. The imaginary part of the generalized reaction matrix in its turn is the sum of inelastic channel contributions:

[formula]

where n runs over all inelastic states and

[formula]

and dΓn is the n-particle element of the phase space volume. The functions Un(s,b,{ξn}) are determined by dynamics of h1 + h2  →  Xn processes, where {ξn} stands for the set of respective kinematical variables. Thus, the quantity U(s,b) itself is a shadow of the inelastic processes. However, unitarity leads to self-damping of the inelastic channels [\cite=bbl] and increase of the function U(s,b) results in decrease of the inelastic overlap function η(s,b) when U(s,b) exceeds unity (cf. Fig. 1).

Corresponding inclusive cross-section [\cite=tmf] [\cite=gluas] which takes into account unitarity in the direct channel has the form

[formula]

The function I(s,b,ξ) is expressed via the functions Un(s,b,ξ,{ξn - 1}) determined by the dynamics of the processes h1 + h2  →  h3 + Xn - 1:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The kinematical variables ξ (x and [formula], for example) describe the state of the produced particle h3 and the set of variables {ξn - 1} describe the system Xn - 1 of n - 1 particles.

Now we turn to the mean multiplicity and consider first the corresponding quantity in the impact parameter representation. The n-particle production cross-section σn(s,b) can be written as

[formula]

Then the probability

[formula]

is

[formula]

Thus, we can observe the cancellation of unitarity corrections in the ratio of cross-sections σn(s,b) and σinel(s,b). Therefore the mean multiplicity in the impact parameter representation

[formula]

does not affected by unitarity corrections and cannot therefore be proportional to η(s,b). This conclusion is consistent with Eq. ([\ref=sr]). The above mentioned proportionality is a rather natural assumption in the framework of the geometrical models, but it is in conflict with the unitarization. Because of that the results of [\cite=enk] based on such assumption and U-matrix unitarization should be taken with precautions. However, the above cancellation of unitarity corrections does not take place for the quantity n̄(s) which we address in the next section.

Growth of mean multiplicity

As a starting point we use a quark model for the hadron scattering described in [\cite=csn]. It is based on the ideas of chiral quark models. The picture of a hadron consisting of constituent quarks embedded into quark condensate implies that overlapping and interaction of peripheral clouds occur at the first stage of hadron interaction (Fig. 2). Nonlinear field couplings could transform then the kinetic energy to internal energy and mechanism of such transformations was discussed by Heisenberg [\cite=heis] and Carruthers [\cite=carr]. As a result massive virtual quarks appear in the overlapping region and some effective field is generated. Constituent quarks located in the central part of hadrons are supposed to scatter in a quasi-independent way by this effective field.

Massive virtual quarks play a role of scatterers for the valence quarks and their hadronization leads to the production of secondary particles. To estimate number of such quarks one could assume that part of hadron energy carried by the outer condensate clouds is being released in the overlap region to generate massive quarks. Then their number can be estimated by:

[formula]

where mQ - constituent quark mass, 〈kQ〉 - average fraction of hadron energy carried by the constituent valence quarks. Function Dhc describes condensate distribution inside the hadron h, and b is an impact parameter of the colliding hadrons.

Thus, Ñ(s,b) quarks appear in addition to N = nh1 + nh2 valence quarks. In elastic scattering those quarks are transient ones: they are transformed back into the condensates of the final hadrons. Calculation of elastic scattering amplitude has been performed in [\cite=csn].

As it was already mentioned hadronization of massive Ñ(s,b) quarks leads to formation of the multiparticle final states, i.e. production of the secondary particles. Remarkably, existence of the massive quark-antiquark matter in the stage preceding hadronization seems to be supported by the experimental data obtained at CERN SPS and RHIC (see [\cite=biro] and references therein).

Since the quarks are constituent, it is natural to expect a direct proportionality between the mean multiplicity of the secondary particles in impact parameter representation and number of constituent quarks appeared in the collision of the initial hadrons with given impact parameter:

[formula]

with a constant factor α. The mean multiplicity n̄(s) can be calculated according to the formula

[formula]

It is evident from Eq. ([\ref=mm]) and Fig. 1 that the antishadow mode with the peripheral profile of η(s,b) suppress the region of small impact parameters and main contribution to the mean multiplicity is due to peripheral region of b  ~  R(s).

To make an explicit calculations we model for simplicity condensate distribution by the exponential form, i.e.

[formula]

Then we have for the mean multiplicity

[formula]

The function U(s,b) is chosen as a product of the averaged quark amplitudes

[formula]

in accordance with assumed quasi-independent nature of valence quark scattering. The b-dependence of the function 〈fQ〉 related to the quark formfactor FQ(q) has a simple form [formula]. Thus, the generalized reaction matrix (in a pure imaginary case) gets the following form [\cite=csn]

[formula]

where [formula]. At sufficiently high energies where increase of total cross-section is prominent we can neglect the energy independent term and rewrite the expression for U(s,b) as

[formula]

After calculation of the integrals ([\ref=mm]) we arrive to the power-like dependence of the mean multiplicity n̄(s) at high energies

[formula]

where

[formula]

We have two free parameters in the model, α̃ and Rc, the freedom of their choice is translated to the free parameters a and δ. The value of parameter ξ = 2 is fixed from the data on angular distributions [\cite=csn] and for the mass of constituent quark was taken the standard value mQ = 0.35 GeV. From the comparison with experimental data (Fig. 3) on mean multiplicity we obtain that δ has value δ≃0.2, which corresponds to effective mass Mc = 1 / Rc≃0.3mQ, i.e. Mc≃mπ. It means that condensate distribution in the hadron is rather broad and does not coincide with the distribution of charged matter given by its formfactor. The value of mean multiplicity expected at the LHC maximum energy ([formula] TeV) is about 110. Note that the numerical estimates for the total cross-section and the ratio of elastic to total cross-section of pp-interaction at this energy in the model are the following: σtot≃230 mb and σel(s)  /  σtot(s)≃0.67 [\cite=reltot]. The latter value could help to detect antishadow scattering mode unambiguously.

Conclusion

It was shown that the model [\cite=csn] based on accounting unitarity and extended to multiparticle production provides a reasonable description of the energy dependence of mean multiplicity leading to its power-like growth with a small exponent. This result is a combined effect of unitarity and existence of the phase preceding hadronization when massive quark-antiquark pairs are generated. It is worth noting again that power-like energy dependence of mean multiplicity appears in various models and is in good agreement with heavy-ion experimental data too .

Multiplicity distribution Pn(s,b) and mean multiplicity n̄(s,b) in the impact parameter representation have no absorptive corrections, but antishadowing leads to suppression of particle production at small impact parameters and the main contribution to the integral mean multiplicity n̄(s) comes from the region of b  ~  R(s). Of course, this prediction is valid for the energy range where antishadow scattering mode starts to develop (the quantitative analysis of the experimental data [\cite=pras] gives the value: [formula] TeV) and is therefore consistent with the "centrality" dependence of mean multiplicity observed at RHIC [\cite=phen].

In addition to the above conclusion, comparison with experimental data has shown that the peripheral condensate cloud of a hadron has rather large size.

It is worth also noting that no limitations follow from the general principles of theory for the mean multiplicity, besides the well known one based on the energy conservation law. Having in mind relation ([\ref=nsbex]), we could say that the obtained power-like dependence which takes into account unitarity effects could be considered as a kind of a saturated upper bound for the mean multiplicity.
