Introduction

The open quantum systems are of strong theoretical interest. As a rule, any microscopic system is always embedded in some (macroscopic) environment and therefore it is never really closed. Frequently, the relevant environment is in principle unobservable or it is unknown [\cite=Mash] [\cite=T1]. This would render the theory of open quantum systems a fundamental generalization of quantum mechanics [\cite=Dav] [\cite=Prig].

Classical open and dissipative systems can have regular or strange attractors [\cite=Hak] [\cite=Lan]. Regular attractors can be considered as a set of (stationary) states for closed classical systems correspondent to open systems. Quantization of evolution equations in phase space for dissipative and open classical systems was suggested in [\cite=Tarpla] [\cite=Tarmsu]. This quantization procedure allows one to derive quantum analogs of open classical systems with regular attractors such as nonlinear oscillator [\cite=Tarpla] [\cite=Tarpr2]. In the papers [\cite=Tarpla] [\cite=Tarmsu] [\cite=Tarpr2] were derived quantum analogs of dissipative systems with strange attractors such as Lorenz-like system, Rossler and Newton-Leipnik systems. It is interesting to consider quantum analogs for regular and strange attractors. The regular "quantum" attractors can be considered as stationary states of open quantum systems. The existence of stationary states for open quantum systems is an interesting fact [\cite=Tarpla2].

In this paper we consider stationary pure states of some open quantum systems. These open systems look like closed quantum systems in the pure stationary states. We consider the quantum analog of dynamical bifurcations considered by J.M.T. Thompson and T.S. Lunn [\cite=TL] for classical dynamical systems. In order to describe these systems, we consider Liouville-von Neumann equation for density matrix evolution such that this Liouville generator of the equation is a function of some Hamiltonian operator. Open quantum systems with pure stationary states of linear harmonic oscillator are suggested. We derive stationary states for quantum Markovian master equation usually called the Lindblad equation. The suggested approach allows one to use theory of bifurcations for a wide class of quantum open systems. We consider the example of bifurcation of pure stationary states for open quantum systems.

Pure stationary state

In the general case, the time evolution of the quantum state |ρt) can be described by the Liouville-von Neumann equation

[formula]

where Λ̂ is a Liouville superoperator on Liouville space, |ρ) is a density matrix operator as an element of Liouville space. For the concept of Liouville space and superoperators see the Appendix and [\cite=Blum]-[\cite=kn2]. For closed systems, Liouville superoperator has the form

[formula]

where H = H(q,p) is a Hamilton operator. If the Liouville superoperator Λ̂ cannot be represented in the form ([\ref=hLo]), then quantum system is called open, non-Hamiltonian or dissipative quantum system [\cite=kn1] [\cite=kn2] [\cite=Tartmf3]. The stationary state is defined by the following condition

[formula]

For closed quantum systems ([\ref=hLo]), this condition has the simple form

[formula]

In the general case, we can consider the Liouville superoperator as a superoperator function [\cite=Tarpla] [\cite=Tarmsu] [\cite=kn1]:

[formula]

where X is a set of linear operators. For example, X = {q,p,H} or X = {H1,..,Hs}. In the paper we use the special form of the superoperator Λ̂ such that

[formula]

where Nk(L̂H,R̂H) are some superoperator functions and k is an arbitrary nonzero superoperator.

It is known that a pure state |ρΨ) is a stationary state of a closed quantum system ([\ref=LN]) and ([\ref=hLo]), if the state |ρΨ) is an eigenvector of the Liouville space for superoperators L̂H and R̂H:

[formula]

Equivalently, the state |ρΨ) is an eigenvector of superoperators L+H and L-H such that

[formula]

The energy variable E can be defined by

[formula]

The superoperators L̂H and R̂H for linear harmonic oscillator are

[formula]

It is known that pure stationary states ρΨn  =  ρ2Ψn of linear harmonic oscillator ([\ref=harm]) exists if the variable E is equal to

[formula]

Pure stationary states of open systems

Let us consider the Liouville-von Neumann equation ([\ref=LN]) for the open quantum system defined of the form

[formula]

Here k is some superoperator and Nk(L̂H,R̂H), where k = 1,...,s, are superoperator functions.

Let |ρΨ) is a pure stationary state of the closed quantum system defined by Hamilton operator H. If equations ([\ref=LRH]) are satisfied, then the state |ρΨ) is a stationary state of the closed system associated with the open system ([\ref=h1]) and is defined by

[formula]

If the vector |ρΨ) is an eigenvector of operators L̂H and R̂H, then the Liouville-von Neumann equation ([\ref=h1]) for the pure state |ρΨ) has the form

[formula]

where the function Nk(E,E) are defined by

[formula]

If all functions Nk(E,E) are equal to zero

[formula]

then the stationary state |ρΨ) of the closed quantum system ([\ref=h2]) is the stationary state of the open quantum system ([\ref=h1]).

Note that functions Nk(E,E) are eigenvalues and |ρΨ) is the eigenvector of the superoperators Nk(L̂H,R̂H), since

[formula]

Therefore stationary states of the open quantum system ([\ref=h1]) are defined by zero eigenvalues of superoperators Nk(L̂H,R̂H).

Open systems with oscillator stationary states

In this section simple examples of open quantum systems ([\ref=h1]) are considered.

1) Let us consider the nonlinear oscillator with friction defined by the equation

[formula]

where the operator H̃ is the Hamilton operator of the nonlinear oscillator:

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=nlo1]) can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

where Δ  =  Ω2  -  ω2 and the superoperator L̂-H is defined for the Hamilton operator H of the linear harmonic oscillator by ([\ref=hLo]) and ([\ref=harm]). Equation ([\ref=nlo2]) has the form ([\ref=h1]), with

[formula]

In this case the function N(E,E) has the form

[formula]

Let γ  =  βm2ω2. The open quantum system ([\ref=nlo1]) has one stationary state of the linear harmonic oscillator with energy En = (ω / 2)(2n + 1), if Δ = 2βω(2n + 1), where n is an integer non-negative number. This stationary state is one of the stationary states of the linear harmonic oscillator with the mass m and frequency ω. In this case we can have the quantum analog of dynamical Hopf bifurcation [\cite=TL] [\cite=MMC].

2) Let us consider the open quantum system described by the time evolution equation

[formula]

where the superoperator L̂-H is defined by formulas ([\ref=hLo]) and ([\ref=harm]). Equation ([\ref=h4]) has the form ([\ref=h1]) if the superoperators [formula] and N(L̂H,R̂H) are defined by

[formula]

The function N(E,E) has the form

[formula]

The stationary state condition ([\ref=sc]) has the solution

[formula]

where n is an integer number. If parameter ε0 is equal to ω, then quantum system ([\ref=h4]) and ([\ref=h4n]) has pure stationary states of the linear harmonic oscillator with the energy ([\ref=En]). As the result, stationary states of the open quantum system ([\ref=h4]) coincide with pure stationary states of the linear harmonic oscillator. If the parameter ε0 is equal to ω(2m + 1), then quantum system ([\ref=h4]) and ([\ref=h4n]) have stationary states of the linear harmonic oscillator with n(k,m) = 2km + k + m and

[formula]

3) Let us consider the superoperator function Nk(L̂H,R̂H) in the form

[formula]

and all superoperators k are equal to L̂I. In this case, the Liouville-von Neumann equation ([\ref=h1]) can be represented by the Lindblad equation [\cite=Lind] [\cite=AL] [\cite=kn1]:

[formula]

with linear operators Vk defined by

[formula]

If |ρΨ) is a pure stationary state ([\ref=LRH]), then all functions Nk(E,E) are equal to zero and this state |ρΨ) is a stationary state of the open quantum system ([\ref=Lin]).

If the Hamilton operator H is defined by

[formula]

then we have some generalization of the quantum model for the Brownian motion of a harmonic oscillator considered in [\cite=Lind2]. Note that in the model [\cite=Lind2] operators Vk are linear Vk = akp + bkq, but in our generalization ([\ref=Lin]) and ([\ref=Lin2]) these operators are nonlinear. For example, we can use Vk = akH + bkH2.

Dynamical bifurcations and catastrophes

Let us consider a special case of open quantum systems ([\ref=h1]) such that the vector function

[formula]

be a potential function and the Hamilton operator H can be represented in the form

[formula]

In this case we have a function V(E) called potential, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

[formula]

where Ek = (I|L̂Hk|ρ) = (I|R̂Hk|ρ). If potential V(E) exists, then the stationary state condition ([\ref=sc]) for the open quantum system ([\ref=h1]) is defined by critical points of the potential V(E). If the system has one variable E, then the function N(E,E) is always a potential function. In general, the vector function Nk(E,E) is potential, if

[formula]

Stationary states of the open quantum system ([\ref=h1]) with the potential vector function Nk(E,E) is depend by critical points of the potential V(E). It allows one to use the theory of bifurcations and catastrophes for the parametric set of functions V(E). Note that a bifurcation in a vector space of variables E = {Ek|k = 1,...,s} is a bifurcation in the vector space of eigenvalues of the Hamilton operator Hk.

For the polynomial superoperator function Nk(L̂H,R̂H) we have

[formula]

In general, m and n are multi-indices. The function Nk(E,E) is a polynomial

[formula]

where the coefficients α(k)n are defined by

[formula]

We can define the variables xl = El - al (l = 1,...,s), such that functions Nk(E,E) = Nk(x + a,x + a) have no the terms xn - 1l.

[formula]

If the coefficient of the term xnl - 1l is equal to zero

[formula]

then we have the following coefficients:

[formula]

If we change parameters α(k)n, then an open quantum system can have pure stationary states of the system. For example, the bifurcation with the birth of linear oscillator pure stationary state is a quantum analog of dynamical Hopf bifurcation [\cite=TL] [\cite=MMC] for classical dynamical system.

Let a vector space of energy variables E be a one-dimensional space. If the function N(E,E) is equal to

[formula]

then the potential V(x) is defined by the following equation

[formula]

and we have catastrophe of type A±  n.

If we have s variables El, where l = 1,2,...,s, then quantum analogs of elementary catastrophes A±  n, D±  n, E±  6, E7 and E8 can be realized for open quantum systems. Let us write the full list of potentials V(x), which leads to elementary catastrophes (zero modal) defined by V(x) = V0(x) + Q(x), where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here Q(x) is the nondegenerate quadratic form with variables x2, x3, ..., xs for A±  n and parameters x3, ..., xs for other cases.

Fold catastrophe

Let us consider the Liouville-von Neumann equation ([\ref=h1]) for a nonlinear quantum oscillator with friction, where multiplication superoperators L̂H and R̂H are defined by ([\ref=harm]) and superoperators [formula] and N(L̂H,R̂H) are given by the following equations:

[formula]

In this case, the function N(E,E) is equal to N(E,E) = α0  +  α1E + α2E2.

A pure stationary state |ρΨ) of the linear harmonic oscillator is a stationary state of the open quantum system ([\ref=F]), if N(E,E) = 0. Let us define the new real variable x and parameter λ by the following equation:

[formula]

Then we have the stationary condition N(E,E) = 0 in the form x2  -  λ = 0. If λ  ≤  0, then the open quantum system has no stationary states. If λ > 0, then we have pure stationary states for a discrete set of parameter values λ. If the parameters α1,α2 and λ satisfy the following conditions

[formula]

where n and m are non-negative integer numbers, then the open quantum system ([\ref=F]) has two pure stationary state of the linear harmonic oscillator. The energies of these states are equal to

[formula]

Conclusion

Open quantum systems can have pure stationary states. Stationary states of open quantum systems can coincide with pure stationary states of closed (Hamiltonian) systems. As an example, we suggest open quantum systems with pure stationary states of linear oscillator. Note that using ([\ref=h1]), it is easy to get open (dissipative) quantum systems with stationary states of hydrogen atom. For a special case of open systems, we can use usual bifurcation and catastrophe theory. It is easy to derive quantum analogs of classical dynamical bifurcations.

Open quantum systems with two stationary states can be considered as qubit. It allows one to consider open n-qubit quantum system described by ([\ref=h1]) as quantum computer with pure states. In general, we can consider open quantum systems as a quantum computer with mixed states [\cite=TarJPA] [\cite=Tarpr1] [\cite=Tarpr3]. A mixed state (operator of density matrix) of n two-level quantum systems (open or closed n-qubit system) is an element of 4n-dimensional operator Hilbert space (Liouville space). It allows one to use quantum computer model with four-valued logic [\cite=TarJPA] [\cite=Tarpr1] [\cite=Tarpr3]. The quantum gates of this model are real, completely positive, trace-preserving superoperators that act on mixed state [\cite=TarJPA] [\cite=Tarpr3].. Bifurcations of pure quantum states can used for quantum gate control.

Liouville space

The space of linear operators acting on a Hilbert space H is a complex linear space [formula]. We denote an element A of [formula] by a ket-vector |A). The inner product of two elements |A) and |B) of [formula] is defined as [formula]. The norm [formula] is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of operator A. A new Hilbert space [formula] with the inner product is called Liouville space attached to H or the associated Hilbert space, or Hilbert-Schmidt space.

Let {|x > } be an orthonormal basis of H:

[formula]

Then |x,x') = ||x >  < x'|) is an orthonormal basis of the Liouville space [formula]:

[formula]

For an arbitrary element |A) of [formula] we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is a kernel of the operator A. An operator ρ of density matrix (Trρ = 1, [formula], ρ  ≥  0) can be considered as an element |ρ) of the Liouville space [formula]. Using ([\ref=|A)]), we get

[formula]

where the trace is represented by

[formula]

Superoperators

Operators that act on [formula], are called superoperators and we denote them, in general, by the hat.

For an arbitrary superoperator Λ̂ on [formula], which is defined by Λ̂|A) = |Λ̂(A)), we have

[formula]

where Λ(x,x',y,y') is a kernel of the superoperator Λ̂.

Let A be a linear operator in the Hilbert space H. We can define the multiplication superoperators L̂A and R̂A by the following equations

[formula]

The superoperator kernels can be easy derived. For example, in the basis |x,x') we have

[formula]

Using

[formula]

we get kernel of the left multiplication superoperator

[formula]

Left superoperators L̂±A are defined as Lie and Jordan multiplication by

[formula]

The left superoperators L̂±A and right superoperators R̂±A are connected by

[formula]

An algebra of the superoperators L̂±A is defined [\cite=Tarmsu] by the following relations 1) Lie relations
