Random matrix theory and discrete moments of the Riemann zeta function

Introduction

Let ζ(s) be the Riemann zeta function, and denote its non-trivial zeros by [formula], with [formula]. (For simplicity, we will assume the Riemann Hypothesis, which says that [formula]). It is known (see, for example, Titchmarsh's book [\cite=Tit1] for details) that if N(T) is the number of zeros with 0 < γn  ≤  T then

Moments of the zeta function, have long been of interest to number theorists, with it being widely believed that with

[formula]

and fk being an integer (when k is integer) divided by (k2)!, whose value was unknown apart from in a few cases. The known values of fk are f0 = 1 (trivial), f1 = 1 (Hardy and Littlewood [\cite=HardyLittle]), and [formula] (Ingham [\cite=Ingham]). The value [formula] has been conjectured by Conrey and Ghosh [\cite=ConGhosh2] and [formula] is a conjecture of Conrey and Gonek [\cite=ConGonek1]. We should mention that a(k) given in [\eqref=eq:a(k)] can be calculated for certain k: a(0)  =  a(1)  =  1 and [formula].

In [\cite=KS1] Keating and Snaith argued that one can create a probabilistic model for the zeta function around height T using the characteristic polynomial of an N  ×  N unitary matrix chosen according to Haar measure, when

Setting

[formula]

and defining [formula] where [formula] denotes expectation with respect to Haar measure, they found that

[formula]

as N  →    ∞   for fixed k subject to [formula], where G(  ·  ) is the Barnes G-function.

By comparing with the known (and previously conjectured) values of fk, they were led to conjecture that [formula].

(Keating and Snaith). For fixed k >  - 1 / 2, as T  →    ∞  , where G(  ·  ) is the Barnes G-function and a(k) is given in [\eqref=eq:a(k)]

Following this, Hughes, Keating and O'Connell [\cite=HKO1] used the characteristic polynomial to model the discrete moments of the derivative of the zeta function, They calculated that for fixed k subject to [formula], as N  →    ∞  , and they used this to conjecture the asymptotic form Jk(T) should take for large T.

(Hughes, Keating and O'Connell). If all the zeros of the zeta function are all simple, then for fixed k >  - 3 / 2, as T  →    ∞  , where a(k) is given by [\eqref=eq:a(k)], and G(  ·  ) is the Barnes G-function.

Again this conjecture is found to agree with all previously known results; when k =  - 1 (a conjecture of Gonek [\cite=Gon1]), when k = 0 (trivial), and when k = 1 (a theorem of Gonek [\cite=Gon0] under RH). Also, extending a theorem due to Conrey, Ghosh and Gonek [\cite=CGG] (recorded in this paper as theorem [\ref=thm:CGG]) beyond its range of (proven) applicability, conjecture [\ref=conj:disc_deriv_k=2] states that [formula], which agrees perfectly with conjecture [\ref=conj:HKO].

It is striking that conjecture [\ref=conj:KS] and conjecture [\ref=conj:HKO] have very similar form. The purpose of this paper is to unify them as special cases of one result.

In the next section we will show where Fk(y) is a certain function, independent of N, given in theorem [\ref=thm:displaced_mmt].

We will then use this to conjecture that for [formula], and will show, in section [\ref=sect:jnts_mmts_zeta], that this conjecture contains conjectures [\ref=conj:KS] and [\ref=conj:HKO] as special cases (α  →    ∞   and α  →  0 respectively). The conjecture is found to agree with a known result of Gonek [\cite=Gon0], and the extension of the theorem due to Conrey, Ghosh and Gonek [\cite=CGG] cited above. These comparisons are discussed in section [\ref=sect:compare_zeta_function].

The random matrix calculation

For fixed k with [formula], and for x  ≤  AN with A < π constant, where

[formula]

where jn(x) are the spherical Bessel functions of the first kind.

Proof. First note that The average of this over all N  ×  N unitary matrices with Haar measure can be written ([\cite=Weyl] [\cite=Mehta]) as an N-fold integral

[formula]

Putting all the j = N terms from the first product into the second, we see that

[formula]

where [formula] is the characteristic polynomial of an (N - 1)  ×  (N - 1) unitary matrix.

By rotation invariance of Haar measure, This is calculated in Theorem [\ref=thm:_jnt_mmt_Z(0)Z(b)] below, where it is shown that for [formula],

[formula]

and substituting this into [\eqref=eq:Z(t1+y)_factor] (where we put β = y / N) we see that where

[formula]

The spherical Bessel functions of the first kind are defined as

[formula]

where Jν(z) is the ν-th order Bessel function of the first kind. Hence, which can be seen by comparing the Taylor expansions.

The above large-N asymptotics are for x = o(N). This can be extended to |x|  ≤  AN for A < π an arbitrary constant as follows: Let β be a fixed constant subject to 0 < β < 2π. By [\eqref=eq:Z(t1+y)_factor] and the results of Basor [\cite=B],

[formula]

If one lets x = Nβ / 2 then the large-x asymptotics of Bessel functions (see, for example, chapter 9 of [\cite=AbramS]) implies that and so theorem [\ref=thm:displaced_mmt] gives the correct first order term as N  →    ∞  , for |x|  ≤  AN with A < π a constant.

Remark. When n is an integer, which leads to a neat evaluation of Fk(2x) for integer k, the first few being:

[formula]

where Mn(2k) is given in [\eqref=eq:defn_M_N(2k)]. If [formula] as N  →    ∞  , then for [formula],

[formula]

Proof. If k in an integer, then

[formula]

which equals, after some simple manipulation of the terms

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the constant term in the Laurent expansion in the variables [formula]. The constant term equals (by lemma 1 of [\cite=Forr])

Kaneko [\cite=Kaneko] has evaluated this integral (which is a generalization of Selberg's integral) as

[formula]

where [formula]. Since we have assumed that k is an integer, and so we have

[formula]

Expanding everything out in terms of the gamma function:

[formula]

where MN(2k) is defined in [\eqref=eq:defn_M_N(2k)]. Observe that the inner summand is invariant as m  →  N - n - m, and so the inner sum is in fact a sum of cosines (and thus the series expansion in β contains only even powers of β). Furthermore observe that both sides of the equation are analytic functions of k (for [formula]), both sides can be easily bounded bounded by [formula] (for large k, with N and β fixed), and the two sides are equal at the positive integers. Thus by Carlson's theorem (see of [\cite=Mehta], for example), the restriction on k being an integer is no longer required, and the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for all complex k.

Now, using the fact that ( - a)n  =  ( - 1)nΓ(a + 1) / Γ(a + 1 - n), we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Gauss hypergeometric function. (If a,c are negative integers with - a <  - c then it is a polynomial of degree - a).

Applying the quadratic hypergeometric transformation 15.3.26 of [\cite=AbramS] we get

[formula]

For m a positive integer, and so we see that the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:hyper_quad_trans] equals

[formula]

Therefore, we have proven

[formula]

where

[formula]

Observe that for fixed k,m,n with [formula],

[formula]

and so

[formula]

in the sense that for each fixed integer h, the coefficient of yh on the Taylor expansion of the left-hand side converges to that of the right-hand side as N  →    ∞  .

Finally we show that

[formula]

This can be proven by comparing the coefficients of y2p. That is, we wish to show for all integer p  ≥  0, This is equivalent to showing

[formula]

for all integer p  ≥  0, and this we shall do by creating the Wilf-Zeilberger pair [\cite=A=B]: Denote the summand in [\eqref=eq:WZ_sum] by F(p,n), and observe that

[formula]

where (the (2k + n)n / (n - p - 1)(k + p) being calculated by Zeilberger's algorithm). Summing both sides of [\eqref=eq:WZ_sum_this] over n, we see that the right-hand side telescopes to zero, which shows that the left-hand side of [\eqref=eq:WZ_sum] must be a constant, independent of p. Putting p = 0, direct calculation shows that constant is 1.

Conjecture about the zeta function

For fixed k subject to [formula], as T  →    ∞  , uniformly in α for |α|  ≤  L, where [formula] is the density of zeros of height T. G(  ·  ) is the Barnes G-function, a(k) is given by [\eqref=eq:a(k)], and Fk(2πα) is given in theorem [\ref=thm:displaced_mmt].

If this conjecture is true, then we are able to prove conjecture [\ref=conj:HKO] and a variant of the Keating-Snaith conjecture (conjecture [\ref=conj:KS]).

If conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts] is true, then

Proof. By the definition of differentiation, From [\eqref=eq:F_series] we have so applying conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts] and using uniformity to swap the α  →  0 and N  →    ∞   limits, we have

[formula]

as required. [formula]

From conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts] it follows that for β > 0 fixed

[formula]

Proof. The asymptotics as z  →    ∞   of the spherical Bessel function (see chapters 9 and 10 of [\cite=AbramS]) are and putting this into [\eqref=eq:defn_F_k(2x)] we have Setting α = Lβ in conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts] completes the proof.

Remark. Note that corollary [\ref=conj:variant_KS] can be thought of as a variant of conjecture [\ref=conj:KS]. This is because one expects the mean of [formula] to be independent of the average taken, and the Keating-Snaith conjecture is a result about the continuous mean, whereas corollary [\ref=conj:variant_KS] is a result about a discrete mean. To see this, recall that the zeros get denser higher up the critical line, and so if β > 0 is fixed and γn is random, one might expect [formula] to be random (whereas, if β was small, it would be highly influenced by the fact that [formula]). The left-hand side of ([\ref=eq:variant_KS]) averages this, and thus acts like a discrete mean of [formula].

Comparison with the zeta function

Gonek [\cite=Gon0] showed that if the Riemann Hypothesis is true then uniformly in α for |α|  ≤  L / 2, which is in perfect agreement with conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts] when k = 1.

There is no proof of the conjecture for k = 2 (unlike conjecture [\ref=conj:KS] which is proven for k = 1 and 2). But there are theorems along the lines of conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts] for k = 2:

(Conrey, Ghosh and Gonek [\cite=CGG].) Assume GRH and let [formula] where [formula] for some [formula]. Then,

[formula]

uniformly for bounded α.

(We have slightly changed notation from [\cite=CGG], to be consistent with our definition of [formula]).

Putting η = 1 in the above (which, as it stands, is not allowed under the conditions of the theorem) then [formula], and we have

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

which is what is predicted in conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts].

That is, from a purely number theoretical calculation involving no random matrix theory, we have

Assuming that η = 1 is permissible in theorem [\ref=thm:CGG] then where F2(2x) is given in [\eqref=eq:F_2(2x)].

So, following the proof of corollary [\ref=conj:disc_deriv_from_jnt_mmts], we may deduce

If conjecture [\ref=conj:jnt_mmts_k=2] is true then

Note that this is the same answer that one gets from putting k = 2 into conjecture [\ref=conj:HKO].
