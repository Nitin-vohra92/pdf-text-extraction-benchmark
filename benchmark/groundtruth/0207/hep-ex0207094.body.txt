A non-QE signature of νe appearance in a water Cherenkov detector

Detecting the "subleading" oscillation νμ  →  νe in an off-axis beam with peak energy near 2-3 GeV has emerged as one of the major goals of the NuMI program [\cite=numi], addressed at a Fermilab workshop in May 2002 [\cite=workshop] and in a recent Letter of Intent on the subject [\cite=loi]. A 2.5-3 times bigger baseline than in the proposed JHF2K experiment [\cite=jhf2k], that will operate at a lower beam energy of Eν  ~   0.7-0.8 GeV, will allow to probe the matter effect by comparing the probabilities of the νμ  →  νe and μ  →  e  transitions. Detector options discussed include a fine-grained low-density calorimeter, a liquid-Argon TPC, and a water Cherenkov spectrometer. Of these, the latter option is based on proven techniques, has an excellent record in neutrino physics [\cite=atmo], and offers best opportunities in terms of maximum target mass at reasonable cost. It appears however that, in the quasielastic mode only discussed thus far, a water Cherenkov detector will perform worse in NuMI than in JHF2K because of more background to 1-ring electronlike events from single-π0 production in NC collisions [\cite=loi]. It has been estimated [\cite=deborah] that, due to considerable NC background to quasielastics, a water Cherenkov detector needs to be ~  3 times as massive as a low-density calorimeter in order to reach similar sensitivity to νμ  →  νe in NuMI conditions. But can the performance of a water Cherenkov detector at Eν  ~   2-3 GeV be boosted by going beyond quasielastics ?

We believe that at neutrino energies ~  2 GeV or higher, the sensitivity to νμ  →  νe can be enhanced by also detecting the CC reactions producing a π0, izero and izero, that largely proceed through excitation of the Δ(1232) and other baryon resonances. Compared to νen  →  e-p and ep  →  e+n, the cross sections of these reactions are small for Eν  <  1 GeV but significant at Eν  ~   2-3 GeV (see Fig. [\ref=xsections]), so that these processes may be relevant to NuMI rather than JHF2K. Depending on whether or not the π0 has been fully reconstructed, two different signatures are possible for a water Cherenkov detector:

Three e-like rings, of which two fit to g;

Two e-like rings that would not fit to a π0.

Despite a smaller cross section, the π0-producing reaction may be competitive with quasielastics because of less neutral-current background: two π0 mesons, and not just one, have to be produced in order to mimic the aforementioned 2- and 3-ring signatures. At neutrino energies of a few GeV in particular, the cross section of the NC reaction νN  →  νπ0π0N should be kinematically suppressed compared to νN  →  νπ0N. This simple conjecture is supported by NEUGEN predictions, see Fig. [\ref=xsections].

The values of oscillation parameters assumed in the simulation are Δm2 = 0.003 eV2, sin 22Θ23  =  1, and sin 22Θ13  =  0.1 (that is, at the CHOOZ limit [\cite=chooz]). Matter effects are not accounted for, as here we only wish to compare the oscillation signals in the single-ring and multi-ring channels. Apart from enhancing the matter effect, increasing the baseline shifts the oscillation maximum to higher values of Eν where the cross sections of the reactions izero and izero are relatively big. Therefore, we select a baseline close to the maximum value for NuMI: L  =  900 km. The displacement from the axis of the NuMI medium-energy beam [\cite=numi], R, is varied in the simulation. The Eν distribution of all νμ-induced CC events in the absence of oscillations, illustrated in Fig. [\ref=all_cc] for the neutrino mode and R  =  10 km, peaks at Eν≃2.6 GeV. In the peak region, the intrinsic νe component of the beam is some 0.3% of the νμ component (see Fig. [\ref=all_cc]). Running in the antineutrino mode will yield some 3 times less CC events for the same number of delivered protons.

Taking into account the experimental conditions of a water Cherenkov detector, actually simulated are the "quasi-inclusive" CC reactions νeN  →  e-X and νeN  →  e-π0X and flavor-blind NC reactions νN  →  νπ0X and νN  →  νπ0π0X in neutrino collisions with water. Here, X denotes a system of hadrons other than the π0, in which the momenta of all charged particles are below the Cherenkov threshold in water. These reactions are analyzed in terms of visible energy [formula], defined as a sum over the energies of all detectable particles: the π0 mesons(s) and the charged lepton for CC reactions.

In a water Cherenkov detector, the two photons from g may show up as a single e-like ring because of a small opening angle (this largely occurs at high π0 momenta), or because one of the photons from an "asymmetric" π0 decay is too soft to be detected [\cite=jhf2k]. The efficiency of π0 reconstruction as a function of its momentum will depend on the geometry and instrumentation of a Cherenkov detector; the estimates quoted below are based on the results for the 1-kiloton detector of K2K [\cite=k2k], as reported in [\cite=pizero]. The momenta of π0 mesons emitted in νeN  →  e-π0X are plotted in Fig. [\ref=pimom], that also shows the distribution of reconstructed π0 mesons (lower histogram). We assume that at least one photon from g is always detected, so that all 1-ring CC events arise from νeN  →  e-X and all 1-ring NC events--from νN  →  νπ0X with unresolved photon showers. The probability for two photons to form a fake π0 candidate is neglected (in SuperK, the r.m.s. width of the π0 peak is only ~  40 MeV [\cite=pizero]). Depending on whether or not the π0 is reconstructible, a CC collision νeN  →  e-π0X will produce 3 or 2 rings in the detector. NC events showing 3 (2) rings arise from failing to reconstruct one π0 (both π0s) in the reaction νN  →  νπ0π0X.

The [formula] distributions of events featuring 1, 2, and 3 e-like rings are shown in Figs. [\ref=nu_9]-[\ref=nu_11] for incident neutrinos and different values of R. The three components of the [formula] distribution for either channel are: the νμ  →  νe signal (yellow area), the NC background (green area), and the intrinsic-νe background (red area). The [formula] interval for estimating the effect is selected so as to maximize the "Figure of Merit" [formula], where S is the number of signal events and B is the total (NC plus intrinsic-CC) background. For either the ν and [formula] settings of the beam, Table [\ref=stati_1] compares the 1-ring and multi-ring samples in terms of total νμ  →  νe signals, numbers of signal and background events in the selected [formula] windows, and statistical significance. Predictably, the ratio between the multi-ring and 1-ring signals decreases with increasing R (or off-axis angle). For incident neutrinos, the multi-ring signal is ~  2 times less than the 1-ring signal in absolute value, but has comparable significance due to less NC background. For incident antineutrinos, the multi-ring signal is substantially less significant than the 1-ring signal.

In a realistic Cherenkov detector, recoil protons often escape detection even for momenta above the Cherenkov threshold [\cite=svoboda]. On average, recoil protons have higher momenta in izero than in νen  →  e-p due to a broader Q2 distribution, so that the multi-ring signal is expected to benefit most from keeping (some) energetic protons. That lifting the upper cut on proton momentum effectively increases the ratio between the multi-ring and 1-ring signals is illustrated by Table [\ref=stati_2], to be compared with Table [\ref=stati_1].

As indicated in [\cite=loi], fast PMT's and good photocathode coverage may help discriminate between the electron- and π0-induced showers by detecting the spatial separation between the conversion points of the two photons from g. If shown to be realistic, this will equally apply to 1-ring and multi-ring signatures of νμ  →  νe. Yet another geometric handle may be possible for multi-ring topologies only, provided that spatial resolution of the detector is better than photon conversion length λc. An important advantage of having more than one ring is that constraining the axes of all rings to a common point in space will yield the position of the primary vertex. Within errors, this should coincide with the reconstructed vertex of a e--induced shower, whereas the vertex of an unresolved π0 shower will be displaced by ~  λc along the shower direction. The spatial resolution of SuperK has been estimated as 18 cm for the vertex of proton decay p  →  e+π0 whose signature is very similar to that of νen  →  e-π0p, and as 34 cm for the vertex of a single e-like ring [\cite=resolution]. We have λc≃40 cm for water, so that even a modest improvement in resolution over SuperK will allow to efficiently discriminate between CC and NC multi-ring events and to measure the NC background (this of course needs to be checked by a detailed simulation of detector response).

To conclude, our preliminary results indicate that analyzing the reaction izero along with the quasielastic reaction νen  →  e-p  may significantly enhance the sensitivity of a water Cherenkov detector to the "subleading" oscillation νμ  →  νe at neutrino energies ~   2-3 GeV. At the level of standard selections, the statistical significance of the multi-ring signal of νμ  →  νe is comparable to that of the 1-ring (quasielastic) signal. The antineutrino reaction izero is a less efficient probe of μ  →  e because its cross section is small. The NC background to izero can be suppressed by reconstructing the vertex of neutrino collision and analyzing spatial separation between the primary and secondary vertices.
