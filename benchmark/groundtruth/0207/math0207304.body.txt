1.  Introduction

Let [formula] be a Banach space. For a non-empty bounded subset A of X and a non-empty subset B of X let's fix the following notations:  d(A): sup [formula] - the diameter of A;  [formula] - the relative Chebyshev radius of A with respect to B;  in particular [formula] with [formula] denoting the closed convex hull of A; a point y∈B is called a Chebyshev center of A in B,  if  [formula]. The Jung constant of X is defined by J(X): sup [formula]. The problem of estimating Jung's constant plays an important role in the geometry of Banach spaces (cf. [\cite=Am], [\cite=Pich]). It is well-known that for inner-product spaces [formula]  ([\cite=Jun], cf. [\cite=Dgk], [\cite=IoT]) and [formula] (H denotes a Hilbert space) ([\cite=Rou]). In general if X is an n-dimensional normed space, then [formula]. Furthermore the equality is attained for certain spaces (see [\cite=Pich]). As for [formula] spaces (p > 1) S. A. Pichugov ([\cite=Pich]) has obtained the exact values for the Jung constant of these spaces:  [formula], if 1 < p  ≤  2, and [formula], if p > 2. Definition 1.1 ([\cite=Nkk]).  We say that a bounded subset A of X consisting of at least two points is an extremal set, if rX(A) = J(X).d(A). The main result of [\cite=Nkk] states that a bounded subset A of a Hilbert space H with r(A) = 1 is extremal if and only if for every [formula], for every positive integer m there exists an  m-simplex Δ with its vertices in A and each edge of Δ has length not less than [formula]. Furthermore for such a subset A we have [formula] and χ(A) = 1, where α(A), χ(A) denote the Kuratowski and Hausdorff measures of non-compactness of A respectively. Our aim in this paper is to treat the next interesting case:  the case of [formula] spaces (1 < p <   ∞  ). We obtain a partial generalization of the result above. More precisely, if A is an extremal subset of a given [formula] space  (1 < p <   ∞  ), then α(A) = d(A). As an immediate consequence one obtains a Gulevich-type result for [formula] spaces:  extremal sets in [formula] are not relatively compact (cf. [\cite=Gul]). Moreover for every ε∈(0,d(A)), for every positive integer m there exists an m-simplex Δ with its vertices in A and each edge of Δ has length not less than d(A) - ε. The proof is based on a further development of a purely combinatorial method in our previous paper [\cite=Nkk] which essentially relies on a very deep part of convex analysis. It should be noted that this observation was first noted in [\cite=IoT], § 10.2, where the authors exposed classical Jung's theorem from the point of view of "subdifferentials", and was later extended in [\cite=Pich] to the case of [formula] spaces. The paper is organized as follows. In § 2 we review some facts related to the "Clearance"-type Theorem ("Decomposition Theorem" in translation), especially for [formula] spaces, we shall need in the sequel. The heart of this section is Proposition 2.1 which should be considered as an infinite-dimensional variation of the main claim in [\cite=Pich]. In § 3 we first formulate without proof two auxiliary inequalities (Lemma 3.1) one of which was essentially due to N. I. Chernykh (personal communication to the author of [\cite=Pich]). Our main results are Theorems 3.2 and 3.4 the proof of which is proceeded then by means of the combinatorial method of [\cite=Nkk] extended to [formula] spaces together with Proposition 2.1 and inequalities from Lemma 3.1.

2.  Preliminaries

For the basic definitions and concepts in convex analysis we refer the reader to [\cite=IoT]. The following proposition is a slight generalization of the main proposition of [\cite=Pich]. Proposition 2.1.  Proof.  For completeness we give here a proof valid in all dimensions. From the uniform smoothness of X it follows that X is reflexive (hence there exists a Chebyshev center of A in X) and the mapping

[formula]

is single-valued. Let's consider the following two functionals:

[formula]

and

[formula]

With A0(x):{a∈A:  F(x,a) = f(x)} we see that the hypotheses of Theorem 3, § 4.2, Chapter 4 in [\cite=IoT] are fulfilled. Hence for every x∈X we have

[formula]

where ∂F(x,  ·  ) and ∂f(x) denote subdifferentials of F and f at x, and the closure in (2.1) is taken in the w*-topology of the space X*, which clearly coincides with the w-topology of X*, since X is reflexive. Recall that for c∈X to be a Chebyshev center of A in X it is necessary and sufficient that 0∈∂f(c) (cf. [\cite=IoT], § 1.3, Proposition 1). One may write [formula] with [formula]  for  [formula]. From (2.1) it follows that  [formula]. Since [formula] we have

[formula]

As noted above J is a single-valued mapping, hence J(yi - c) consists of a unique point, say fi. Therefore [formula], and so there exist non-negative numbers [formula] such that [formula] and [formula]. Without loss of generality one can assume that all [formula] are positive. It is a simple verification that these data also satisfy the conditions (i), (ii) above. The proof is complete. Remark 2.2.  We shall be interested mainly in the case [formula]. For this purpose it is more convenient to use the following "scaled" version of the mapping J:  for x∈X and p∈(1,  ∞  ) we define [formula] Obviously for fi,yi and c as in Proposition 2.1, [formula]. Remark 2.3.  It is well-known that spaces [formula] are both uniformly convex and uniformly smooth. Hence the mapping J is single-valued. Also it is weakly sequentially continuous in the following sense: if {xn} converges weakly to x in [formula], then {J(xn)} converges weakly to J(x) in [formula] ([formula]). Remark 2.4.  Clearly if [formula], then J(x) = (sgn(x1).|x1|p - 1, sgn[formula]sgn[formula]. Hence in the situation of Proposition 2.1 with [formula] we have

[formula]

3.  The results

For our use later it is convenient to formulate two auxiliary inequalities in the following lemma. Lemma 3.1.  The proof is standard, and we shall omit it. Theorem 3.2.  Here α(A) denotes the Kuratowski measure of non-compactness of A. Proof.  We may assume [formula]. Then for each integer number n  ≥  2 we have [formula], where B(x,r) denotes the closed ball centered at x with radius r which is weakly compact since [formula] is reflexive. Hence there exist  [formula] in A such that [formula] (with convention t1 = 0). Setting [formula] we denote the Chebyshev center of An in [formula] by cn and let [formula], then [formula]. In view of Proposition 2.1 one can find [formula] in An, continuous linear functionals [formula] on [formula] and positive numbers [formula] (with convention s1 = 0) such that: (i)  〈yi - cn,fi〉 = rn for  [formula]; (ii)  [formula]; (iii)  [formula]. Setting [formula] we claim that [formula]. Suppose on the contrary [formula]. Then one can choose ε0∈(0,d(A)) satisfying [formula], and so subsets [formula] of [formula] with d(Di)  ≤  d(A) - ε0 for every [formula], such that [formula]. There exists at least one set among [formula], say D1 with the property that there are infinitely many n satisfying

[formula]

where

[formula]

We shall estimate the sum [formula]. We have

[formula]

As noted in Remark 2.4

[formula]

Therefore for all i,j∈In

[formula]

1)  The case 1 < p  ≤  2:  Since the Jung constant [formula], thus [formula]. Applying part (i) of Lemma 3.1 coordinatewise to the above expression and remembering [formula] one gets

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Comparing (3.2) and (3.3) we obtain

[formula]

for all n satisfying (3.1). Since there infinitely many such n and [formula], we come to a contradiction. 2)  The case p > 2:  Since the Jung constant [formula], thus [formula]. Writting [formula] with vij  =  sgn[formula] and applying part (ii) of Lemma 3.1 coordinatewise to [formula] we obtain

[formula]

and therefore after summing up

[formula]

The last equality follows from [formula] which in turn can be deduced from the condition [formula], or equivalently [formula]. Thus in view of (3.2)

[formula]

[formula]

a contradiction, because [formula] and there are infinitely many n satisfying (3.1). One concludes that [formula], and hence α(A) = d(A). The proof of Theorem 3.2 is complete. As an immediate consequence one obtains an extension of Gulevich's result for [formula] spaces. Corollary 3.3 (cf. [\cite=Gul]).  Theorem 3.4.  Proof.  We shall assume [formula]. From the proof of Theorem 3.2 we derived a sequence [formula] in A, a sequence of continuous linear functionals [formula] in [formula] and a sequence of positive numbers {αsn - 1 + 1, αsn1 + 2, , [formula] (with convention s1 = 0) such that: (i)  〈yi - cn,fi〉 = rn for  [formula]; (ii)  [formula]; (iii)  [formula],

where [formula], and [formula]. Also we have

[formula]

1)  The case 1 < p  ≤  2.  We denote by

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  . Thus

[formula]

On the other hand

[formula]

So

[formula]

for each i∈In. Therefore [formula] as n  →    ∞  . One concludes that

[formula]

This implies that for each positive integer m one can choose n sufficiently large so that [formula]. For j∈Sn put

[formula]

As j∈Sn we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and so

[formula]

Now for a given positive integer m we choose n sufficiently large such that

[formula]

We claim that for every choice of [formula] we have

[formula]

Indeed, otherwise [formula] would imply

[formula]

Consequently by (3.4) and (3.5)

[formula]

or [formula], a contradiction to the choice of n. Furthermore from (3.6) it follows that if 1  ≤  k  ≤  m and [formula], then

[formula]

With m and n as above let's fix some j∈Sn. Setting z1:j we take consecutively [formula]. Obviously

[formula]

for all i  ≠  j in [formula]. Now for a given [formula] one can choose n sufficiently large as above, and moreover so that

[formula]

One obtains an m-simplex formed by [formula], whose edges have length not less than [formula], as claimed. 2)  The case 2 < p <   ∞   can be proceeded in the same way just with replacing those Tnj and Sn in the first case suitably, i.e. as

[formula]

The proof of Theorem 3.4 is complete.
