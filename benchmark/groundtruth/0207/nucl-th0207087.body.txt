Q2-evolution of ΔNγ form factors up to 4 ~ (GeV / c)2 from JLab data

Introduction

It is known that for about 20 years the question: which is the scale of transition from soft to hard mechanism of QCD in exclusive processes, is the subject of controversy. Detail discussion of this problem can be found, for example, in papers [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3]. The point of view, that this scale should be large, i.e. much larger than now available Q2, is based mainly on the utilization of asymptotic wave function and is confirmed by the results obtained using local quark-hadron duality [\cite=4]. On the other hand there are arguments, based mainly on the utilization of the Chernyak-Zhitnitsky wave function [\cite=5], that hard mechanism of QCD can be observed at quite small Q2. Experimental data on proton elastic form factors and form factors for the second and third resonance peaks extracted from inclusive data [\cite=3], indeed, manifest the features which are characteristic of pQCD starting with very small Q2, about 2 - 3 ~ GeV2. However, for γ*N  →  Δ(1232) the strong numerical suppression of the leading order amplitude is obtained using the wave functions of CZ type [\cite=6]. By this reason, in distinction to other form factors, the hard mechanism is expected for γ*N  →  Δ(1232) at much higher Q2. Information on the Q2- evolution of the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +, S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + for the γ*N  →  Δ(1232) transition will allow to check this expectation, because the transition from soft to hard mechanism is characterized by a striking change in the behaviour of E3 / 21 + / M3 / 21 +, S3 / 21 + / M3 / 21 + from

[formula]

at Q2 = 0 to

[formula]

in the pQCD regime. By this reason, investigation of the Q2-evolution of the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +, S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + is very informative for understanding of the mechanisms and the scale of transition to pQCD regime.

In this report, we present the results on the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +, S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + for the γ*N  →  Δ(1232) transition at Q2 = 0.4, ~ 0.525, ~ 0.65, ~ 0.75, ~ 0.9, ~ 1.15, ~ 1.45, ~ 1.8, ~ 2.8, ~ 4 ~ (GeV / c)2. These results are extracted from the JLab data [\cite=7] [\cite=8] on p(e,e'p)π0 cross section using two approaches: dispersion relations and modified version of the unitary isobar model of Ref. [\cite=9]. The detail description of the approaches is done in Ref. [\cite=10].

Results and discission

The obtained results for the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +, S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + are presented in Figure [\ref=inter].

In this Figure the results obtained by truncated multipole analysis of at Q2 = 0.4, ~ 0.525, ~ 0.65, ~ 0.75, ~ 0.9, ~ 1.15, ~ 1.45, ~ 1.8 ~ (GeV / c)2 [\cite=9] and using dynamical and unitary isobar models at Q2 = 2.8, ~ 4 ~ (GeV / c)2 [\cite=11] are also presented.

Let us note, that presented results correspond to the so called "dressed" γNΔ vertex, i.e. are extracted from the whole magnitudes of multipoles M(3 / 2)1 +, E(3 / 2)1 +, S(3 / 2)1 + at the resonance position, where δ(3 / 2)1 +  =  π / 2. Extraction of "bare" multipoles can be made only using models and is model-dependent.

Note also, that there are two sets of results at Q2 = 0.65, ~ 0.75, ~ 0.9 ~ (GeV / c)2, which is connected with two kinds of measurements of p(e,e'p)π0 cross section in [\cite=8] at different energies of initial electron.

From Figure [\ref=inter] it is seen that the results obtained using different approaches agree with each other. The ratio E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + remains small in all Q2 region up to 4 ~ (GeV / c)2, revealing some tendency to cross zero above Q2 > 2 ~ (GeV / c)2. However, this tendency is not clear, and only measurements at higher Q2 can clear up the situation here. The absolute value of the ratio S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + is clearly increasing with increasing Q2, and does not reveal the tendency of approaching the constant value. So, at [formula] there is no indication of approaching pQCD regime for the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + and S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude, that the behaviour of the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + and S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + at [formula] is related to the soft mechanisms. By this reason in Figure [\ref=inter] the predictions based on the soft approaches are presented. These are light-cone relativistic quark model predictions [\cite=12] [\cite=13], predictions of relativized quark model [\cite=14], and the results of Ref. [\cite=15] obtained by interpolation between very low and very high Q2. Both light-cone relativistic quark models give qualitatively good description of the ratio S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +, but in the case of E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + they contradict the obtained results. In contrast with this, the relativized quark model predictions [\cite=14] for E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + are close to the results extracted from experimental data, however, in the case of S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + the prediction of this model: S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +≃0, disagrees with these results. The predictions of Ref. [\cite=15] contradict the obtained results for both ratios. So, none of the soft approaches gives satisfactory description of the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + and S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + in the investigated region of Q2.

Conclusion

In summary, we have analysed JLab data on p(e,e'p)π0 cross section at Q2  ≤  4 ~ (GeV / c)2 in the Δ(1232) resonance region within two approaches: dispersion relations and modified version of unitary isobar model. As a result, we have obtained information on Q2-evolution of the ratios E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + and S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 +, which are of interest for understanding the scale and mechanisms of transition from soft to hard regime of QCD in exclusive processes. The obtained results show that there is no evidence yet of approaching pQCD regime for the γ*N  →  Δ(1232) transition, and for investigation of the scale, where hard mechanism for this transition begin to work, measurements at higher Q2 are needed. We have compared the results on E(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + and S(3 / 2)1 + / M(3 / 2)1 + with existing predictions obtained within soft approaches. It turned out, that none of the soft approaches gives simultaneously satisfactory description of these ratios. This means, that more detail investigations of soft mechamisms for γ*N  →  Δ(1232) are necessary.
