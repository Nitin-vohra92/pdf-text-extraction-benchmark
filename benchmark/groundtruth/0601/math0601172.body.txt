Independent Sets in Graphs with an Excluded Clique Minor

Introduction

In 1943, [\citet=Hadwiger43] made the following conjecture, which is widely considered to be one of the most important open problems in graph theory; see [\citep=Toft-HadwigerSurvey96] for a survey.

Hadwiger's Conjecture. For every integer [formula], every graph with no Kt + 1-minor is t-colourable. That is, χ(G)  ≤  η(G) for every graph G.

Hadwiger's Conjecture is trivial for [formula], and is straightforward for t = 3; see [\citep=Hadwiger43] [\citep=Dirac52] [\citep=Woodall-JGT92]. In the cases t = 4 and t = 5, [\citet=Wagner37] and [\citet=RST-Comb93] respectively proved that Hadwiger's Conjecture is equivalent to the Four-Colour Theorem [\citep=AH77_I] [\citep=AH77_II] [\citep=RSST97]. Hadwiger's Conjecture is open for all [formula]. Progress on the t = 6 case has been recently been obtained by [\citet=KT-Comb05] (without using the Four-Colour Theorem). The best known upper bound is [formula] for some constant c, independently due to [\citet=Kostochka82] and [\citet=Thomason84] [\citet=Thomason01].

Since [formula] for every graph G, Hadwiger's Conjecture implies that

[formula]

as observed by [\citet=Woodall-JGT87]. In general, [\eqref=WeakHadwiger] is weaker than Hadwiger's Conjecture, but if α(G) = 2, then [\citet=PST-DMGT03] proved that [\eqref=WeakHadwiger] is in fact equivalent to Hadwiger's Conjecture. The first significant progress towards [\eqref=WeakHadwiger] was made by [\citet=DM82] (also see [\citep=MM-DM87]), who proved that

[formula]

This result was improved by [\citet=KPT-JCTB05] to

[formula]

Assuming [formula], [\citet=KPT-JCTB05] proved that

[formula]

which was further improved by [\citet=KS05] to

[formula]

The following theorem is the main contribution of this note.

Every graph G with [formula] satisfies

Observe that Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] represents an improvement over [\eqref=DM], [\eqref=KPT] and [\eqref=KS] whenever [formula] and [formula]. For example, Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] implies that [formula] for every graph G with η(G)  ≤  6, whereas each of [\eqref=DM], [\eqref=KPT] and [\eqref=KS] imply that [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]

Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] employs the following lemma by [\citet=DM82]. The proof is included for completeness.

Every connected graph G has a connected dominating set D and an independent set S  ⊆  D such that |D| = 2|S| - 1.

Let D be a maximal connected set of vertices of G such that D contains an independent set S of G and |D| = 2|S| - 1. There is such a set since D: = S: = {v} satisfies these conditions for each vertex v. We claim that D is dominating. Otherwise, since G is connected, there is a vertex v at distance two from D, and there is a neighbour w of v at distance one from D. Let [formula] and [formula]. Thus D' is connected and contains an independent set S' such that |D'| = 2|S'| - 1. Hence D is not maximal. This contradiction proves that D is dominating.

The next lemma is the key to the proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem].

Suppose that for some integer [formula] and for some real number p  ≥  t, every graph G with η(G)  ≤  t satisfies [formula]. Then every graph G with η(G)  ≥  t satisfies

We proceed by induction on η(G) - t. If η(G) = t the result holds by assumption. Let G be a graph with η(G) > t. We can assume that G is connected. By Lemma [\ref=DominatingSet], G has a connected dominating set D and an independent set S  ⊆  D such that |D| = 2|S| - 1. Now [formula]. Thus we are done if

[formula]

Now assume that [\eqref=Dbig] does not hold. That is, Thus Since D is dominating and connected, [formula]. Thus by induction,

[formula]

This completes the proof.

Suppose that Hadwiger's Conjecture is true for some integer t. Then every graph G with η(G)  ≥  t satisfies

If Hadwiger's Conjecture is true for t then [formula] for every graph G with η(G)  ≤  t. Thus Lemma [\ref=MainLemma] with p = t implies that every graph G with η(G)  ≥  t satisfies which implies the result.

Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] follows from Lemma [\ref=SecondLemma] with t = 5 since Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for t = 5 [\citep=RST-Comb93].

Concluding Remarks

The proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem] is substantially simpler than the proofs of [\eqref=KPT1]-[\eqref=KS], ignoring its dependence on the proof of Hadwiger's Conjecture with t = 5, which in turn is based on the four-colour theorem. A bound that still improves upon [\eqref=DM], [\eqref=KPT] and [\eqref=KS] but with a completely straightforward proof is obtained from Lemma [\ref=SecondLemma] with s = 3: Every graph G with [formula] satisfies [formula].

We finish with an open problem. The method of [\citet=DM82] was generalised by [\citet=ReedSeymour-JCTB98] to prove that the fractional chromatic number χf(G)  ≤  2η(G). For sufficiently large η(G), is χf(G)  ≤  2η(G) - c for some constant [formula]?
