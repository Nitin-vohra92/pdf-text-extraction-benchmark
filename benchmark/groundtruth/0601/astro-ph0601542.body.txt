COLLAPSE OF POSITRONIUM AND VACUUM INSTABILITY

,

It is accepted that magnetic fields are stable in pure quantum electrodynamics (QED), and other interactions (weak or strong) or magnetic monopoles have to be involved to make the magnetized vacuum unstable [\cite=NO78]. In this Talk (see Ref. [\cite=SU05] for a detailed version) we establish, within the frame of QED, that there exists a hypercritical value of the magnetic field

[formula]

Here α = e2 / 4π≃1 / 137, B0 = m2 / e = 4.4  ×  1013G, m is the electron mass. The value ([\ref=final]) is less than the magnetic field ~  (1047 - 1048) G expected to be present near superconductive cosmic strings [\cite=W95] and the one (~  1047G) produced at the beginning of the inflation [\cite=KK89]. The hypercritical magnetic field leads to the shrinking of the energy gap between an electron and positron that takes place due to the falling to the center. The latter is caused by the ultraviolet singularity of the photon propagator (or Coulomb potential) [\cite=goldstein] plus the dimensional reduction in the magnetic field [\cite=loudon] - [\cite=gusynin]. We discuss the vacuum structure around the hypercritical magnetic field and its possible decay under a further growth of the magnetic field - that may cause its screening.

We rely on the theory of the falling to the center developed in [\cite=shabad] that implies deviations from the standard quantum theory manifesting themselves when extremely large electric fields near the singularity become important. In that theory the singularity in the Schrödinger-like equation yields a singular measure in the scalar product and hence the geometry of a black-hole-like object. (Stress, that the geometry is induced: no interaction of gravitational origin is included.)

We proceed from the (3+1)-dimensional Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation in an approximation, which is the ladder approximation once the photon propagator (in the coordinate space) is taken in the Feynman gauge: Dij(x) = gijD(x2), [formula], gii = (1, - 1 - 1 - 1). In an asymptotically strong magnetic field this equation may be written [\cite=SU05] in the following (1+1)-form covariant under the Lorentz transformations along the axis 3:

[formula]

where Θ(t,z) is the 4×  4 (Ritus transform of) BS amplitude, t = xe0  -  xp0 and z = xe3 - xp3 are the differences of the coordinates of the electron (e) and positron (p) along the time x0 and along the magnetic field [formula]. [formula] and [formula] are projections of the total (generalized) momentum of the positronium onto the (0,3)- subspace and the (1,2)-subspace. Only two Dirac gamma-matrices, γ0,3, are involved,   =  ∂tγ0  -  ∂zγ3,  = P0γ0 - P3γ3.

Equation ([\ref=closed1]) is valid in the domain, where the argument of D is greater than the electron Larmour radius squared (LB)2 = (eB)- 1. When B =   ∞  , this domain covers the whole exterior of the light cone z2 - t2  ≥  0.The argument of the original photon propagator (xe - xp)2 has proved to be replaced in ([\ref=closed1]) by [formula], where [formula] are the center of orbit coordinates of the two particles in the transversal plane. Now that after the dimensional reduction this subspace no longer exists these substitute for the transversal particle coordinates themselves: [formula]are not coordinates, but quantum numbers of the transverse momenta. The mechanism of replacement of a coordinate by a quantum number is the same as in [\cite=ShUs].

In deriving equation ([\ref=closed1]) the expansion over the complete set of Ritus matrix eigenfunctions [\cite=ritus] was used in [\cite=SU05] that accumulate the dependence on the transversal spacial and spinorial degrees of freedom. This expansion yields an infinite set of equations, where different pairs of Landau quantum numbers ne, np are entangled, Eq. ([\ref=closed1]) being the equation for the (ne = np = 0)-component that decouples from this set in the limit B =   ∞  .

In the ultra-relativistic limit [formula] equation ([\ref=closed1]) is solved by the most symmetric Ansatz Θ = IΦ, where I is the unit matrix.

The ultraviolet singularity on the light cone (x2 = 0) of the free photon propagator, D(x2) =  - (i / 4π2)(1/x2), after this expression is used in eq. ([\ref=closed1]), leads to falling to the center in the Schr[formula]dinger-like differential equation

[formula]

to which the radial part of equation ([\ref=closed1]) is reduced in the most symmetrical case, when the wave function Φ(x) = s- 1 / 2Ψ(s) does not depend on the hyperbolic angle φ in the space-like region of the two-dimensional Minkowsky space, [formula].

The solution that decreases at s  →    ∞   is given by the McDonald function with imaginary index: [formula] oscillating when s  →  0. The falling to the center [\cite=QM] holds for any positive α.

According to [\cite=shabad], the singular equation ([\ref=last3]) should be considered as the generalized eigenvalue problem with respect to α. The operator in the left-hand side is self-adjoint provided the standing wave condition is imposed,

[formula]

that treats the Larmour radius as the lower edge of the normalization box. The discrete eigenvalues αn(LB) condense in the limit B =   ∞   to become a continuum of states that form the (rigged) Hilbert space of vectors orthogonal with the singular measure s- 2ds. The latter fact allows to normalize them to δ-functions and interpret as free particles emitted and absorbed by the singular center. As long as the Larmour radius is much smaller than the only characteristic length in eq.([\ref=last3]), electron Compton length, LB  ≪  m- 1≃3.9  ×  10- 11 cm., the small-distance asymptotic regime is reached, and nothing "behind the horizon," s < LB, - where the two-dimensional equations ([\ref=closed1]) and ([\ref=last3]) are not valid - may affect the problem. In this way the existence of the limit of vanishing regularization length, impossible in the standard theory, is achieved.

For sufficiently large magnetic fields LB becomes so small that the region where Kν(ms) oscillates gets inside the domain of validity of equation ([\ref=last3]). The value of the magnetic field when this happens for the first node is just ([\ref=final]). The corresponding Larmour radius is about fourteen orders of magnitude smaller than m- 1 and makes ~  10- 25 cm. Eq. ([\ref=final]) tells how large the magnetic field should be in order that the boundary problem ([\ref=last3]), ([\ref=stand]) might have a solution, in other words, that the point [formula] might belong to the spectrum. Therefore, if the magnetic field exceeds the first hypercritical value the positronium ground state exists with its rest energy compensated for by the mass defect.

The ultra-relativistic state Pμ = 0 has the internal structure of what was called a "confined state", belonging to kinematical domain called "sector III" in [\cite=shabad], i.e. the one whose wave function behaves as a standing wave combination of free particles near the lower edge of the normalization box and decreases as exp ( - ms) at large distances. The effective "Bohr radius", i.e. the value of s that provides the maximum to the wave function makes s max = 0.17m- 1. This is certainly much less than the standard Bohr radius (e2m)- 1. Taken at the level of 1/2 of its maximum value, the wave function is concentrated within the limits 0.006 ~ m- 1 < s < 1.1 ~ m- 1. But the effective region occupied by the confined state is still much closer to s = 0, since - in accord with the aforesaid - the probability density of the confined state is the wave function squared weighted ~ with ~ the ~ measure s- 2ds singular ~ in ~ the ~ origin [\cite=shabad] and is hence concentrated near the edge of the normalization box s≃10- 25cm, and not in the vicinity of the maximum of the wave function. The electric fields at such distances are about 1043 Volt/cm. Certainly, there is no evidence that the standard quantum theory should be valid under such conditions. This fact encourages the use of a theory that admits deviations from the standard quantum theory that close to the singularity point.

At B = B(1)hpcr the total energy and momentum of a positronium in the ground state are zero. This state is not separated from the vacuum by an energy gap, and has maximum symmetry in the coordinate and spin space. Hence, it may be related to the vacuum and responsible for its structure.

At B > B(1)hpcr the eigenvalues of the BS equation ([\ref=closed1]) for the total 2-momentum components P0,3 of the e+-e- system are expected to shift into the space-like region (we keep [formula]), whereas for B < B(1)hpcr the c.m. 2-momentum of the real pair was, naturally, time-like. If P0,3  ≠  0, at least for far space-like [formula], the situation can be modelled by the same equation as ([\ref=last3]), but with the large negative quantity [formula] substituted for m2. Then the wave function would contain two oscillating exponentials for large space-like intervals,

[formula]

and two oscillating exponentials [formula] for small ones, s  ~  LB. In the Lorentz frame, where P0 = 0,P3  ≠  0, and with the time arguments in the two-time BS amplitude equal to one another: xe0 = xp0, the solution oscillates along the magnetic field with respect to the relative coordinate xe3 - xp3 (mutually free particles) and with respect to the c.m. coordinate xe3 + xp3 (vacuum lattice).

We are now in the kinematical domain called sector IV, or deconfinement sector in Refs.[\cite=shabad]. Here the constituents are free at large intervals and near the singular point s = 0. The wave incoming from infinity is partially reflected, and partially penetrates to the singular point, the probability of creation of the delocalized (free) states being determined by the barrier transmission coefficient [\cite=shabad]. Such states may exist if one succeeds to satisfy e.g. periodic conditions, to be imposed on the lower and upper boundaries of the normalization volume, instead of condition ([\ref=stand]), appropriate in sector III. The possibility to obey them is provided again by the falling to the center. Now, the delocalized states in two-dimensional Minkowsky space correspond to electron and positron that circle along Larmour orbits with vanishing radii in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field and simultaneously perform, when the interval between them is large, a free motion along the magnetic field. They have magnetic moments and seem to be capable of screening the magnetic field. This provides the mechanism that may prevent the classical magnetic field from being larger than a second hypercritical field, for which the delocalization first appears. No sooner than the delocalized states are found in our present problem one may definitely claim the instability of the vacuum with the second hypercritical magnetic field or - which is the same - the instability of such field under the pair creation that might provide the mechanism for its diminishing. For the present, we state that the first hypervalue ([\ref=final]) is such a value of the magnetic field, the exceeding of which would already cause restructuring of the vacuum.
