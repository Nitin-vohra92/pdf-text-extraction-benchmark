Quadratic field equations on the brane.

Introduction.

Two frequent variants on Einstein's equations are equations involving quadratic lagrangians and those involving higher dimensions, and there is the possibility of these variants describing dynamics on large distance scales. This paper studies the relationship between solutions to the four dimensional Einstein equations and these more complex equations. The curvature tensors corresponding to quadratic lagrangians can be split into three parts: the Gauss-Bonnet tensor GBab which vanishes in four dimensions, the Pauli tensor Pab corresponding to the R2 part of the lagrangian, and the Bach tensor Bab corresponding to the Weyl tensor squared part of the lagrangian. Here the five dimensional line element

[formula]

where ds24 is a given four dimensional solution is considered. The quadratic tensors corresponding to this line element are worked out directly, although perhaps they could be worked out using existing formalisms such as the ADM [\cite=ADM62] or the Gauss-Coddacci equations [\cite=HE].

The type of questions the resulting equations allow to be addresses are: when are "black holes", such as the four dimensional Schwarzschild solution, solutions to five dimensional equations, for previous work see [\cite=DMPR] [\cite=MM] [\cite=leon] [\cite=DG]; when are four dimensional radiating solutions solutions to five dimensional equations, for previous work see [\cite=mdrfi] [\cite=DG]; and when are other four dimensional solutions, such as the Kasner solution, solutions to five dimensional equations [\cite=mdrkb]. Having Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet equations obeyed in the bulk leads to better approximations to Newton's law on the brane [\cite=DS] [\cite=KL]. The conventions used are early latin indices [formula] for five dimensional quantities, middle latin indices for four dimensional quantities [formula], signature -  +  +  +  + .

Solutions

The first set of solutions is that the vacuum-Bach equations are obeyed when

[formula]

In general this is not the same solution as

[formula]

substituting ([\ref=l5]) into ([\ref=bachdef]) the Bach tensor always vanishes, substituting ([\ref=l4]) into ([\ref=B5ij]) gives vanishing Bach tensor, however substituting ([\ref=l4]) into the Ricci tensor ([\ref=Ricci5]) gives

[formula]

which is more general than ([\ref=l5]) and reduces to ([\ref=l5]) when [formula].

The second set of solutions are that for [formula], which implies [formula],

[formula]

where β is an arbitrary constant, the solutions in the abstract are obtained when β = 0,1. That for β = 0,1 the field equations are obeyed by the four dimensional Schwarzschild and Kasner solutions was noted in [\cite=mdrfi] [\cite=mdrkb]. Despite the arbitrary constant β there does not appeared to be any other simple solutions. For example the ansatz ([\ref=l4]) applied to the Bach and Pauli equations does not seem to lead to generalizations of ([\ref=Ff]), similarly for the ansatz [formula]. For [formula] coupled to scalar fields, vector fields and fluids there is not much simplification of the quadratic tensors. The above does not indicate why the Gauss-Bonnet tensor vanishes for the first and second five dimensional scalar solutions of [\cite=mdrfi], because for these spacetimes the geometry is different from ([\ref=le]).

Conclusion.

On length scales of about that of a stellar cluster and larger it seems that the perfect fluid Einstein equations no longer work because they are not able to explain constant galactic rotation curves [\cite=mdrhs]; so the question arises as to what field equations determine dynamics on large scales. From string theory it seems that the most likely variant of general relativity at large scales involve the Gauss-Bonnet tensor [\cite=zwiebach]. The Gauss-Bonnet combination in d = 5 Randall-Sundrum setup has been explicitly shown to only give rise to short-distance corrections to the brane Newton potential [\cite=DS] [\cite=KL]; on the other hand brane gravity in an infinite transverse volume d = 5 Einstein-Hilbert-Gauss-Bonnet theory might display a large-distance non-conventional behavior leading to different laws of attraction. Four dimensional vacuum Einstein equations certainly seem to hold on middle length scales, as it is from them that contact is made with Newtonian theory. These two facts suggest that field equations such as ([\ref=Ff]) with β = 1 could hold on large scales. The problem with this is the extra term [formula] which occurs in the fifth dimension. The fifth dimension is usually taken to be free of matter so that there is little possibility of a five dimensional stress cancelling it. There are surface tension terms in the fourth dimension, these are terms involving products but not higher derivatives of the stress, they 'nearly' cancel out the product terms of the Bach tensor ([\ref=HX]), but do not seem to be connected to the Gauss-Bonnet field equations ([\ref=Ff]) with β = 1. Dilatonic terms are likely to contribute to the four dimensional part of the field equation, and these terms might explain galactic rotation curves [\cite=mdrst], but again dilatonic terms are unlikely to cancel the extra term in the fifth dimension of ([\ref=Ff]).
