Can a Hagedorn system have a temperature other than TC or can a thermostat have a temperature other than its own?

Introduction

In a recent paper (nucl-th/0504010), we have shown that systems with exponential spectra [formula] such as the Hagedorn mass spectrum and the bag model mass spectrum act as thermostats at temperature TC = 1 / a and impart this unique temperature to any system thermally coupled to them. In contrast to this, the standard wisdom asserts that such systems admit any temperature T < TC according to their "alleged" partition function Z(T) = TCT / (TC - T).

In what follows we try to show that the above partition function is incorrect and leads to erroneous results when applied to resonance gases, etc.

An interesting exercise

Consider a system A composed of ice and water at standard pressure. For such a system the temperature is TA = 273 K. Because of coexistence, we can feed or extract heat to/from the system without changing TA. The system A is a thermostat.

If a quantity Q of heat is added to the sytem, the change in entropy is

[formula]

The level density of A is then

[formula]

The level density, or spectrum, is exponential in E and depends only on the intrinsic "parameter" TA. Let us calculate the partition function of A:

[formula]

This seems to indicate that A can assume any temperature 0  ≤  T < TA.

But, by hypothesis, the only temperature possible for A is TA. What is the trouble?

The canonical ensemble and the "implicit" thermostat

Let us consider two systems A,B with level densities ρA and ρB. Let the systems be thermally coupled to each other with total energy E. We now calculate the distribution in energies between the two systems,

[formula]

Let A be a "thermostat", i.e. ρA = eε / TA. Then

[formula]

Let us integrate over x

[formula]

This is the origin of the partition function ZB(TA) and the meaning of "implicit" thermostat. By changing "thermostat" we can change TA and the temperature of B.

Thus, every time we construct a partition function, we imply the gedanken experiment of connecting the sytem to a thermostat, and that this experiment is actually possible for the system we are studying.

Does this always work?

To see this, let us look for the most probable value of the distribution ρT(x), which defines the equilibrium partition, by taking the log and differentiating:

[formula]

[formula]

or

[formula]

For this to be possible, it is necessary that ρA and ρB admit the same logarithmic derivative somewhere in the allowed range of energy x.

Usually, and always for concave functions (convex functions are anathema!), S(x)  =   ln ρ(x) and T = (∂S / ∂x)- 1 is such that 0  ≤  T  ≤    ∞  . Thus, for such systems it is possible to match derivatives for whatever value of E. Thermal equilibrium is achievable only at the temperature of the thermostat.

However, if SA(E)  =   ln ρA(E) is linear in E, then TA = (∂S / ∂E)- 1 is a constant, independent of E. In this case, it is up to B to look for the value of x at which its logarithmic derivative matches 1 / TA. The system A is a "thermostat" at T = TA and B can only try to assume the value T = TB = TA, if it can do so.

Now suppose that also SB(E)  =   ln ρB(E) is linear in E with an inverse slope TB. This means that only if TA = TB is equilibrium possible, and the partition function of B, ZB is meaningfully defined only for T = TB and not for 0  ≤  T  ≤  TB. We cannot force a temperature T  ≠  TB on a thermostat. It can only have its own intrinsic temperature TB.

Placing systems A and B into contact will lead to a continuous heat flow from one system to the other. Thermal equilibrium is not achievable.

To summarize: it is permissible to calculate the partition function of a system only if its S(E) admits as inverse derivatives values such as we want to impose through our Laplace transform. Failing that, the resulting partition function does not satisfy any thermodynamic criterion.
