Introduction and main results

The main object of this paper is the magnetic Schrödinger operator with the Dirichlet boundary conditions in an open set [formula]. This operator has the form

[formula]

where aj = aj(x), V = V(x), [formula]. We assume that aj and V are real-valued functions, V  ≥  0, V∈L1loc(Ω) and a∈L∞loc(), i.e. for every [formula] we have aj∈L∞loc(Ω) and the extension of aj by 0 to [formula] is in [formula].

Denote also and define the quadratic form

[formula]

on functions u∈C∞0(Ω). Then we can define the operator Ha,V by the closure of this quadratic form in L2(Ω). This closure exists [\cite=Leinfelder-Simader].

In this paper we will discuss criteria for the discreteness of spectrum and strict possitivily of Ha,V in L2(Ω), as well as two-sided estimates for the bottoms of the spectrum and essential spectrum. For the discreteness of spectrum criteria the requirement V  ≥  0 can be replaced by the semi-boundedness of V from below.

We will say that Ha,V has a discrete spectrum if its spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicities. It follows that the only accumulation point of these eigenvalues is +    ∞  . Equivalently we may say that Ha,V has a compact resolvent.

Our first goal is to provide a direct necessary and sufficient condition for the discreteness of the spectrum of Ha,V. Another condition was established in [\cite=Kondratiev-Mazya-Shubin]. The difference between them is that the condition in [\cite=Kondratiev-Mazya-Shubin] almost completely separates electric and magnetic fields, whereas the condition in this paper, which is otherwise simpler, is based on a combined characteristic of the fields. Both conditions use Wiener capacity as was originated by A. Molchanov [\cite=Molchanov] and later developed by V. Maz'ya (see [\cite=Mazya8]) for the usual Schrödinger operator without magnetic field. (See also [\cite=Mazya-Shubin] [\cite=Mazya-Shubin2] for more recent results and references.)

We will denote the Wiener capacity of a compact set [formula] by   cap  (F). By Qd we will denote a closed cube with the edges of length d, which are parallel to coordinate axes. In case n = 2 the capacity of F  ⊂  Qd will be taken with respect to [formula], the interior of Q2d.

Let [formula], i.e. P is a polynomial in [formula] with complex coefficients. We will call it generic on Qd if 0 is not a critical value of the map [formula] for a neighborhood U of Qd in [formula]. This means that the gradients of Re  P and Im  P are linearly independent on the null-set of P, i.e on the set Then this set is a non-singular algebraic submanifold of real codimension 2. It follows that its capacity is 0 (see e.g. [\cite=Meyers] [\cite=Mazya-Havin]). By the Sard Lemma, for any given polynomial P, the polynomial P + c will be generic on Qd for almost all [formula]. It follows that the set of generic (on Qd) polynomials of a fixed degree is an open and dense set in the set of all polynomials of this degree.

It is clear from the remarks above that generic polynomials form a dense set in C∞(Qd).

Now we will formulate our main discreteness of spectrum result.

1) Let d0 > 0, and let γ  =  γ(d) be defined for d∈(0,d0), take values in (0,1) and satisfy the condition

[formula]

Then the spectrum of Ha,V in L2(Ω) is discrete if and only if for every d∈(0,d0)

[formula]

where F runs over compact sets, such that

[formula]

and F satisfies the negligibility condition

[formula]

ω runs over complex valued functions from [formula], where e is a compact set such that e  ⊂  Int  F (e depends on ω), |ω(x)| = 1 for every [formula]. Here Qd  →    ∞   means that the cube Qd goes to infinity with fixed d.

2) The same is true if ω runs over all functions of the form P / |P| where P is a generic polynomial with complex coefficients on Qd, defined on [formula]. (In this case the test functions ω and sets F are taken independently.)

The conditions above taken with different functions γ are equivalent.

If for a fixed cube Qd there are no compact sets F satisfying the conditions [\eqref=E:in-F-out] and [\eqref=E:negligible], then the infimum in [\eqref=E:discr2] is naturally declared to be +    ∞  . In other words, in [\eqref=E:discr2] we can restrict ourselves to cubes Qd which are essentially in Ω i.e. have negligible intersection with [formula] in the sense that

The advantage of the second part of Theorem [\ref=T:discr2], as compared with the first one, is that the test sets F and functions ω run over the corresponding families independently. However it has a disadvantage too: the integral in [\eqref=E:discr2] can be +    ∞   if [formula]. It is easy to see that it is indeed +    ∞   if [formula]. So this situation can be excluded from the consideration in [\eqref=E:discr2] since we are only interested in the infimum. However the integral can also be +    ∞   if [formula], but P- 1(0) intersects with the boundary of [formula].

We can locally represent ω in the form ω = eiφ, where φ is a locally defined real-valued C∞ function. We can in fact consider φ as a globally defined function with values in [formula]. Then [formula], and we see that taking infimum over ω's in [\eqref=E:discr2] is a way of minimizing over different gauges.

Theorem [\ref=T:discr2] extends the main result of [\cite=Mazya-Shubin] to the case of magnetic Schrödinger operators. (To get the discreteness of spectrum result of [\cite=Mazya-Shubin] we can take [formula] and observe that then [formula] minimizes the integral in the left hand side of [\eqref=E:discr2].) More general test bodies were considered in [\cite=Mazya-Shubin] instead of cubes, and V was allowed to be a positive Radon measure, which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Wiener capacity (instead of a positive locally integrable function). These results can be also extended to the magnetic Schrödinger operators without additional difficulties. We have chosen the simplest case for our exposition to make it more transparent.

Another necessary an sufficient condition of the discreteness of spectrum for the magnetic Schrödinger operators, obtained in [\cite=Kondratiev-Mazya-Shubin], is different in the nature of characterization of magnetic fields, and it allows only small negligible sets (i.e. small γ's), so it does not extend the result of [\cite=Mazya-Shubin], unlike Theorem [\ref=T:discr2]. The same applies to the positivity results below.

Now we will formulate our main positivity result. We will say that the operator Ha,V is strictly positive if its spectrum is contained in

[formula]

Positivity

In this section we will prove Theorem [\ref=T:pos] and provide its interesting corollary.

Proof of sufficiency in Theorem [\ref=T:pos]. Let us assume that [\eqref=E:pos] holds for some d > 0 and κ > 0 (with any of two versions for the set of ω's). Using Corollary [\ref=C:Mazya2], as in the proof of the sufficiency in Theorem [\ref=T:discr2], we come to the conclusion that the estimate [\eqref=E:la-pos] holds with

[formula]

hence Ha,V is strictly positive. [formula]

Proof of necessity in Theorem [\ref=T:pos]. Let us assume that Ha,V is strictly positive, i.e. the estimate [\eqref=E:la-pos] holds. Then arguing as in the proof of necessity in Theorem [\ref=T:discr2], we come to the estimate [\eqref=E:final-nec] with ε  =  λ- 1 and η given by [\eqref=E:eta]. It follows that

[formula]

This implies the inequality

[formula]

provided d > 0 is chosen so that

[formula]

This works for both versions of the choices of ω's and so ends the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:pos]. [formula]

Two-sided estimates for the bottom of the spectrum

In this section we will establish two-sided estimates for the bottom of the spectrum for the Schrödinger operators Ha,V in L2(Ω). These estimates extend and improve results by V. Maz'ya and M. Otelbaev [\cite=Mazya-Otelbaev] (see also [\cite=Mazya8], Sect. 12.2, 12.3) where the case of Schrödinger operators without magnetic fields was considered. The results are based on the notion of the capacitary interior diameter which is defined as follows:

[formula]

where the choice of the pairs F,ω is as in Theorem [\ref=T:pos] (with any of two options there), with γ∈(0,1) assumed to be a constant. It is easy to see that D > 0 (take d to be very small). On the other hand it may happen that D =  +   ∞  ; for example this is the case if Ω contains arbitrarily large cubes (e.g. [formula]) and both a and V vanish identically, i.e. when Ha,V =  - Δ in [formula]. So generally 0 < D  ≤    +    ∞  .

It is easy to see that D is an increasing function of Ω and γ (provided a and V are fixed).

The definition of D by [\eqref=E:D] can be extended to the case when γ  =  γ(d), i.e. γ:(0, +   ∞  )  →  (0,1), but for simplicity we will only consider the case when γ is a constant.

For every γ∈(0,1) there exists C = C(γ,n) > 0, such that

[formula]

where λ is the bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum of Ha,V in L2(Ω), i.e. the best constant in [\eqref=E:la-pos].

Note that Ha,V is strictly positive if and only if λ > 0. Therefore [\eqref=E:2-sided] implies that the strict positivity is equivalent to the inequality D <  +   ∞  . More precisely, the first inequality in [\eqref=E:2-sided], estimating λ from below, implies the sufficiency in Theorem [\ref=T:pos], whereas the second one, estimating λ from above, implies the necessity in this theorem. We will obtain proofs of these inequalities by analyzing corresponding parts of the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:pos].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=T:2-sided]. 1) Let us start with proving the first inequality, estimating λ from below. Denote the bottom of Neumann spectrum of Ha,V on Qd by μ(Qd), i.e. μ(Qd) is the left hand side of [\eqref=E:nec-loc]. (Note that it depends upon Ω too.) Then [\eqref=E:Mazya(2)-cor] implies that for every d > 0 and every cube Qd

[formula]

where ṽ  =  ṽ is the "effective potential" defined by [\eqref=E:effective]. Therefore,

[formula]

Let us assume that for some d > 0 we have

[formula]

(This holds in particular if d > D.) Then we obviously have

[formula]

for this particular d. Taking limit as [formula], we obtain the same inequality with d = D, which proves the left inequality in [\eqref=E:2-sided].

2) Now let us prove the second inequality in [\eqref=E:2-sided], estimating λ from above. To this end let us look at the inequalities [\eqref=E:final-pos2] and [\eqref=E:d-ge]. They imply that there exists C = C(γ) > 0 such that for every cube Qd at least one of the inequalities

[formula]

must hold. By definition of D (see [\eqref=E:D]) this implies that λ  ≤  CD- 2 which ends the proof. [formula]

For the Dirichlet Laplacian (i.e. for H0,0 =  - Δ) in domains Ω and for small γ > 0 the result of Theorem [\ref=T:2-sided] was proved in [\cite=Mazya-74]. This result for arbitrary γ∈(0,1) was obtained in [\cite=Mazya-Shubin2], where also explicit values of the constants in the upper and lower bounds were given.

Persson type theorem for magnetic Schrödinger operators

This section contains a preparatory result, expressing the bottom of the essential spectrum of Ha,V in L2(Ω) as a limit of the bottoms of the Dirichlet spectrum of this operator on the exteriors of large balls. The first result of this kind is probably due to Persson [\cite=Persson] (for the usual Schrödinger operators, without magnetic field), see also Chapter 3 in [\cite=Agmon82] and Theorem 3.12 in [\cite=CFKS]. (In particular, the Laplacian is replaced by general second-order operators in divergence form in [\cite=Agmon82].) The arguments given in these sources can be extended to our case. Nevertheless for the sake of convenience of the reader we offer a proof which seems to be different from what we have seen in the literature.

For any open set [formula], denote by λ(U;Ha,V) the bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum of Ha,V in L2(U), i.e. the spectrum of the operator defined by the closure of the quadratic form ha,V (see [\eqref=E:haV]) in L2(U) from the initial domain C∞0(U). In other words,

[formula]

where (  ·  ,  ·  ) means the scalar product in L2(U).

Usually Ha,V will be fixed in our arguments, and in this case we will write λ(U) instead of λ(U;Ha,V) if this does not lead to a confusion.

Note that U  ⊂  U' implies λ(U)  ≥  λ(U').

For any self-adjoint operator H in a Hilbert space H and any [formula] denote by [formula] (or [formula]) the spectral projection of H corresponding to the interval ( -   ∞  ,λ). Let us introduce the "counting function" of the spectrum by

[formula]

It is an increasing function of λ with values in

[formula]

because [formula] increases with respect to R.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=P:la-infty]. 1) Let us prove first that λ∞ is not larger than the right hand side in [\eqref=E:la-infty]. To this end it suffices to consider the case when the right hand side is finite.

Let us take an arbitrary λ̃ such that

[formula]

Taking R1 > 0 arbitrary and using the inequality [formula], we can find a function [formula], such that [formula] (here [formula] means the norm in [formula]) and ha,V(ψ1,ψ1) < λ̃. Choose R2 > R1 so that [formula]. Now using the inequality [formula], we can construct [formula] so that [formula] and ha,V(ψ2,ψ2) < λ̃. Proceeding by induction, we can construct an orthonormal sequence of functions ψk∈C∞0(Ω), [formula], with disjoint supports, such that ha,V(ψk,ψk) < λ̃ for all k. It follows that ha,V(u,u) < λ̃(u,u) for any u  ≠  0 in the linear span L of the sequence {ψk}. This implies that N(λ̃) =  +   ∞  , hence λ∞  ≤  λ̃ due to [\eqref=E:la-infty-abstr]. Since λ̃ is an arbitrary number satisfying [\eqref=E:tilde-la], this proves that λ∞ does not exceed the right hand side of [\eqref=E:la-infty].

2) Now let us prove that λ∞ is not smaller than right hand side of [\eqref=E:la-infty]. To this end it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

for every compact set K  ⊂  Ω. It is enough to consider the case when λ∞  <    ∞  . Ad absurdum let us assume that [formula] for some K. Let us choose λ̃ so that

[formula]

Due to [\eqref=E:la-infty-abstr] we have N(λ̃) =  +   ∞  , and the same is true if we replace λ̃ by λ̃  -  ε for a sufficiently small ε > 0. Therefore, due to Corollary [\ref=C:N-la-2], for every integer N > 0 we can find a subspace L  ⊂  C∞0(Ω), such that dim L = N and

[formula]

On the other hand, the opposite inequality is true if [formula]. More precisely, according to [\eqref=E:la-Om],

[formula]

We will establish that the combination of [\eqref=E:haV-on-L] and [\eqref=E:haV-out] is impossible if N is sufficiently large. To this end we will split |u|2 for every u∈L into a sum |u0|2 + |u1|2 where u0 is supported in a neighborhood of K and u1 has its support in [formula]. This splitting is conveniently done by use of the IMS localization formula (see e.g. Section 3.1 in [\cite=CFKS] and Lemma 3.1 in [\cite=Shubin96]).

Let us choose R0 > 0, so that K  ⊂  BR0(0), and take R > 2R0. We can choose functions J0∈C∞0(B2R(0)) and [formula], such that J0 = 1 on R0(0), 0  ≤  J0(x)  ≤  1 for all [formula], J1  ≥  0, [formula] (hence J1  ≤  1 and J1 = 0 on R0(0)), and

[formula]

Due to the IMS localization formula we obtain for any [formula]

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=E:der-est] and [\eqref=E:IMS] that

[formula]

The inequality [\eqref=E:haV-out] implies

[formula]

Taking u∈L, we obtain from [\eqref=E:haV-on-L], [\eqref=E:IMS-ge] and [\eqref=E:haV-J1] that

[formula]

If R > 0 is sufficiently large, so that [formula], we obtain (The inequality is strict if J0u  ≠  0.) It follows from Corollary [\ref=C:N-la-2], that for the subspace [formula] where [formula] is the operator Ha,V in [formula] with the Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e. the operator defined by the closure of the quadratic form ha,V in [formula] from [formula]. Since [formula] is bounded, [formula] has a discrete spectrum, so the number [formula] is finite.

Now let us consider the multiplication-by-J0 operator, restricted to L:

[formula]

Then   Ker  MJ0 consists of functions from L which vanish on [formula] (in particular, in a neighborhood of K), so [formula]. Therefore, for any function u∈  Ker  MJ0 both estimates [\eqref=E:haV-on-L] and [\eqref=E:haV-out] should be satisfied. Since [formula], this is only possible if u = 0.

So we conclude that   Ker  MJ0  =  {0}, so the map MJ0 is injective. It follows that This contradicts to the assumption [\eqref=E:la-3] which implies that N can be arbitrarily large. Hence we proved [\eqref=E:la-infty-below]. [formula]

Two-sided estimates for the bottom of the essential spectrum

Now we turn to two-sided estimates of the bottom of the essential spectrum for Ha,V in L2(Ω). Denote [formula] and (cf. [\eqref=E:D]). Since DR decreases as R increases, we can define

[formula]

So D∞∈[0,  +     ∞ ], and both 0 and +    ∞   can occur. Clearly, DR, D∞ increase with γ provided Ω,a,V are fixed. Similarly, they increase with Ω, i.e. if Ω  ⊂  Ω', then DR(Ω,γ,a,V)  ≤  DR(Ω',γ,a,V), and the same is true for D∞.

There exists C = C(γ,n) > 0 such that

[formula]

where λ∞ is the bottom of the essential spectrum of Ha,V in L2(Ω).

Proof. The result immediately folows from [\eqref=E:D-infty] and Theorem [\ref=T:2-sided]. [formula]

Theorem [\ref=T:discr2] with γ = const follows from Theorem [\ref=T:2-sided-ess] because the discreteness of spectrum is equivalent to the equality λ∞ =  +   ∞  , and the equality D∞ = 0 is equivalent to the corresponding conditions in Theorem [\ref=T:discr2].

A special class of operators

In this Section we will consider special magnetic Schrödinger operators Ha,V in [formula], with the potentials of the form where [formula]. In particular, a and V do not depend on the last coordinate xn. So the operator has the form

[formula]

We assume that the local regularity conditions [formula], [formula] are satisfied, and, as above, V  ≥  0, hence the self-adjoint operator Ha,V is well defined through the quadratic form,

Note that the magnetic field B = da does not generally vanish for such a potential a, but the corresponding skew-symmetric matrix (Bjk)nj,k = 1 has a special form, with Bjk = 0 if 1  ≤  j,k  ≤  n - 1.

Since the operator Ha,V is invariant with respect to translations along the xn axis, making Fourier transform from xn to [formula], we obtain that Ha,V is unitary equivalent to the following direct integral of self-adjoint operators

[formula]

where which is a Schrödinger operator without magnetic field in [formula], with a positive scalar potential depending quadratically upon a parameter [formula]. Since the term 2μan(x') is dominated by the sum of the other terms in the right hand side, the regular perturbation theory applies, so it follows, in particular, that the bottom of the spectrum of Ha,V(μ) is a continuous function of μ. Moreover, the bounded parts of whole spectrum of Ha,V(μ) are continuous with respect to [formula] in a natural sense. Due to the direct integral decomposition, we see that all the spectrum of Ha,V is essential (i.e., it has no isolated points of finite multiplicity).

Now let λ,λμ denote the bottoms of the spectra of the operators Ha,V and Ha,V(μ) respectively. Then it follows from the direct integral decomposition [\eqref=E:tilde-H] and the arguments above, that

[formula]

Finally, similar to [\eqref=E:D], let us define where 0 < γ  <  1 and the second infimum is taken over F  ⊂  Qd, satisfying the negligibility condition   cap  (F)  ≤  γ  cap  (Qd).

Now using the simplest version of Theorem [\ref=T:2-sided] (without magnetic field, i.e. with [formula]), we immediately obtain

For every γ∈(0,1) there exists C = C(γ,n) > 0, such that
