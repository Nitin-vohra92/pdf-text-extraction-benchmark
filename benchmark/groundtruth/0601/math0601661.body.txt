Nonexistence of locally self-similar solution

We are concerned here on the following Euler equations for the homogeneous incompressible fluid flows on [formula].

[formula]

where v = (v1,v2,v3), vj = vj(x,t), j = 1,2,3, is the velocity of the flow, p = p(x,t) is the scalar pressure, and v0 is the given initial velocity, satisfying div v0 = 0.

The system (E) has the scaling property that if (v,p) is a solution of the system (E), then for any λ > 0 and [formula] the functions

[formula]

are also solutions of (E) with the initial data vλ,α0(x) = λαv0(λx).

This scaling property leads to the following definition of self-similar blowing up solution of (E):

A solution v(x,t) of the solution to (E) is called a self-similar blowing up solution if there exist α  >   - 1, T* > 0 and a solenoidal vector field V defined on [formula] such that

[formula]

The above definition is apparently 'global' in the sense that the self-similar representation of solution in ([\ref=vel]) should hold for all space-time points in [formula]. On the other hand, many physicists have been trying to seek a 'locally self-similar' solution of the 3D Euler equations(see e.g. [\cite=pel] and the references therein). We formulate the precise definition of this in the following.

A solution v(x,t) of the solution to (E) is called a locally self-similar blowing up solution near a space-time point [formula] if there exist r > 0, α  >   - 1 and a solenoidal vector field V defined on [formula] such that the representation

[formula]

holds true, where [formula].

We have the following relation between the two notions of self-similar blowing up solutions.

The nonexistence of self-similar solution of the 3D Euler equations in the sense of Definition 1 implies the nonexistence of locally self-similar solution in the sense of Definition 2.

Combining Theorem 1 with the main theorem in [\cite=cha](Theorem 1.1), we have the following corollary.

Suppose there exists a locally self-similar blowing up solution of the 3D Euler equations in the form ([\ref=vela]). If there exists p1 > 0 such that [formula] for all p∈(0,p1), then necessarily Ω = 0. In other words, there exists no nontrivial locally self-similar solution to the 3D Euler equation if the vorticity Ω satisfies the integrability condition above.

Proof of Theorem 1. We assume there exists a locally self-similar blowing up solution v(x,t) in the sense of Definition 2. The proof of the theorem follows if we prove the existence of self-similar blowing up solution in the sense of Definition 1 based on that assumption. By translation in space-time variables, we can rewrite the velocity in ([\ref=vela]) as

[formula]

We observe that, under the scaling transform ([\ref=self]), we have the invariance of the representation,

[formula]

while the region of space-time, where the self-similar form of solution is valid, transforms according to

[formula]

We set λ = 1 / n, and define the sequence of locally self-similar solutions {vn(x,t)} by [formula] with v1(x,t) = v(x,t). In the above we find that

[formula]

and each vn(x,t) is a solution of the Euler equations for all [formula]. Let us define v∞(x,t) by

[formula]

Given a compact set [formula], we observe that vn  →  v∞ as n  →    ∞   on K in any strong sense of convergence. Indeed, for sufficiently large N = N(K), [formula] for (x,t)∈K, if n > N. Hence, we find that v∞(x,t) is a solution of the Euler equations for all [formula], which is a self-similar blowing up solution, after translation in time, in the sense of Definition 1. [formula]

We note that the above proof obviously works also for the self-similar solutions of the other equations considered in [\cite=cha] and Leray's self-similar solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations(see [\cite=ler] for the problem, and [\cite=nec] for the rule-out of the 'global' self-similar solution).
