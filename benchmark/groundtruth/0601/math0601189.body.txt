Projective normality of algebraic curves and its application to surfaces

Theorem Proposition Remark Corollary

Introduction

We work over the algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Specially the base field is the complex numbers in considering the classification of surfaces. A smooth irreducible algebraic variety V in [formula] is said to be projectively normal if the natural morphisms [formula] are surjective for every nonnegative integer m. Let C be a smooth irreducible algebraic curve of genus g. We say that a base point free line bundle L on C is normally generated if C has a projectively normal embedding via its associated morphism [formula].

Any line bundle of degree at least 2g + 1 on a smooth curve of genus g is normally generated but a line bundle of degree at most 2g might fail to be normally generated ([\cite=KK1], [\cite=LM1], [\cite=Mum]). Green and Lazarsfeld showed a sufficient condition for L to be normally generated as follows ([\cite=GL], Theorem 1): If L is a very ample line bundle on C with [formula] (and hence h1(C,L)  ≤  1), then L is normally generated. Using this, we show that a line bundle L on C with [formula] is normally generated for [formula]. As a corollary, if C is a triple covering of genus p curve C' with [formula] then it has a very ample KC( - φ*D) which is normally generated for any divisor D on C' with [formula]. It is a kind of generalization of the result that KC( - rg13) on a trigonal curve C is normally generated for [formula] ([\cite=KK]).

As an application to nondegenerate smooth surface [formula] of degree 2Δ - e with g(H) = Δ + f, [formula] for some [formula], we obtain that S is projectively normal with ~ pg = f and [formula] if its general hyperplane section H is linearly normal, where Δ: =  deg S - r + 1. Furthermore we characterize smooth projective surfaces S for K2S =  - 2f - e + 2, 0 (cf. Theorem [\ref=thm5.3]). These applications were derived by the methods in Akahori's, Livorni's and Sommese's papers ([\cite=Ak], [\cite=Liv], [\cite=So]).

We follow most notations in [\cite=ACGH], [\cite=GH], [\cite=H]. Let C be a smooth irreducible projective curve of genus g  ≥  2. The Clifford index of C is taken to be [formula] where [formula] for a line bundle L on C. By abuse of notation, we sometimes use a divisor D on a smooth variety V instead of OV(D). We also denote Hi(V,OV(D)) by Hi(V,D) and h0(V,L) - 1 by r(L) for a line bundle L on V. We denote KV a canonical line bundle on a smooth variety V.

Normal generation of a line bundle on a smooth curve

Any line bundle of degree at least 2g + 1 on a smooth curve of genus g is normally generated. If the degree is at most 2g, then there are curves which have a non normally generated line bundle of given degree ([\cite=KK1], [\cite=LM1], [\cite=Mum]). In this section, we investigate the normal generation of a line bundle with given degree on a smooth curve under some condition about the speciality of the line bundle.

Let L be a very ample line bundle on a smooth curve C of genus g with [formula]. Then L is normally generated if [formula].

Suppose L is not normally generated. Then there exists a line bundle A≃L( - R), ~ R > 0, such that [formula], [formula], h0(C,A)  ≥  2 and h1(C,A)  ≥  h1(C,L) + 2 by the proof of Theorem 3 in [\cite=GL]. Assume deg KCL- 1 = 3, then |KCL- 1| = g13. On the other hand, L = KC( - g13) is normally generated. So we may assume deg KCL- 1  ≥  4 and then r(KCL- 1)  ≥  2 since deg L > 2g + 2 - 4h1(C,L). Set B1(resp. B2) is the base locus of KCL- 1(resp. KCA- 1). And let N1: = KCL- 1( - B1), ~ N2: = KCA- 1( - B2). Then [formula] since [formula] and h1(C,A)  ≥  h1(C,L) + 2. Hence we have the following diagram,

where Ci  =  φNi(C).

If we set mi: =  deg φNi, ~ i = 1,2, then we have m2|m1. If N1 is birationally very ample, then by Lemma 9 in [\cite=KK1] and [formula] we have [formula] It is a contradiction to deg L > 2g + 2 - 4h1(C,L) that is equivalent to deg KCL- 1 < 4(h0(C,KCL- 1) - 1). Therefore N1 is not birationally very ample, and then we have m1  ≤  3 since deg KCL- 1 < 4(h0(C,KCL- 1) - 1).

Set H1 be a hyperplane section of C1. If |H1| on a smooth model of C1 is special, then [formula], which is absurd. Thus |H1| is nonspecial. If m1 = 2, then

[formula]

for any pairs (P,Q) such that φN1(P) = φN1(Q) since |H1| is nonspecial. Therefore we have r(L( - P - Q))  ≥  r(L) - 1 for (P,Q) such that φN1(P) = φN1(Q), which contradicts that L is very ample. Therefore we get m1 = 3. Suppose B1 is nonzero. Set P  ≤  B1 for some P∈C. Consider Q,R in C such that φN1(P) = φN1(Q) = φN1(R) = P' for some P'∈C1. Since |H1| is nonspecial, we have

[formula]

which is a contradiction to the very ampleness of L. Hence KCL- 1 is base point free, i.e., KCL- 1 = N1. On the other hand, we have m2 = 1 or 3 for m2|m1. Since [formula], we may set N1 = N2( - G) for some G > 0.

Assume m2 = 1, i.e. KCA- 1( - B2) = N2 is birationally very ample. On the other hand we have [formula], since [formula] and [formula]. In case deg N2  ≥  g we have [formula] by Castelnuovo's genus bound and hence

[formula]

since N2 = KCA- 1( - B2) and [formula]. If we observe that the condition [formula] is equivalent to [formula], then we meet an absurdity. Thus we have deg N2  ≤  g - 1, and then Castelnuovo's genus bound produces deg N2  ≥  3r(N2) - 2. Note that the Castelnuovo number π(d,r) has the property π(d,r)  ≤  π(d - 2,r - 1) for d  ≥  3r - 2 and r  ≥  3, where [formula] d - 1 = m(r - 1) + ε, ~  ~ 0  ≤  ε  ≤  r - 2 (Lemma 6, [\cite=KK1]). Hence

[formula]

because of [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], we can induce a strict inequality π( deg N1,r(N1)) < g as only the number regardless of birational embedding from the proof of Lemma 9 in [\cite=KK1]. It is absurd. Hence m2 = 3, which yields [formula].

Set H2 be a hyperplane section of C2. If |H2| on a smooth model of C2 is special, then [formula]. Thus the condition deg KCL- 1 < 4(h0(C,KCL- 1) - 1) yields the following inequalities:

[formula]

which contradicts to [formula]. Accordingly |H2| is also nonspecial.

Now we have [formula] where p is the genus of a smooth model of [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

which is a contradiction that deg N1  <   deg N2. This contradiction comes from the assumption that L is not normally generated, thus the result follows.

Using the above theorem, we obtain the following corollary under the same assumption:

Let C be a triple covering of genus p curve C' with [formula] and D a divisor on C' with [formula]. Then KC( - φ*D) becomes a very ample line bundle which is normally generated.

Set d: =  deg D and L: = KC( - φ*D). Suppose L is not base point free, then there is a P∈C such that |KCL- 1(P)| = gr + 13d + 1. Note that gr + 13d + 1 cannot be composed with φ by degree reason. Therefore we have g  ≤  6d + 3p due to the Castelnuovo-Severi inequality. Hence it cannot occur by the condition [formula]. Suppose L is not very ample, then there are P,Q∈C such that |KCL- 1(P + Q)| = gr + 13d + 2. By the same method as above, we get a similar contradiction. Thus L is very ample. The condition [formula] produces [formula] since deg KCL- 1 = 3d and h0(C,KCL- 1) = h0(C',D) = d - p + 1. Whence [formula] is satisfied. The condition 4p < d induces deg KCL- 1 > 4(h0(C,KCL- 1) - 1), i.e., deg L > 2g + 2 - 4h1(C,L). Consequently L is normally generated by Theorem [\ref=3.5.6].

Application to projective surfaces

Let [formula] be a nondegenerate smooth surface and H a smooth hyperplane section of S. If H is projectively normal and h1(H,OH(2)) = 0, then q = h1(S,OS) = 0, ~ pg = h2(S,OS) = h1(H,OH(1)) and h1(S,OS(t)) = 0 for all nonnegative integer t ([\cite=Ak], Lemma 2.1, Lemma 3.1). In this section, using our result about the projective normality of smooth curves in section 2, we can characterize smooth projective surfaces with the wider range of degree and sectional genus. Recall the definition of Δ-genus given by Δ: =  deg S - r + 1.

Let [formula] be a nondegenerate smooth surface of degree 2Δ - e with g(H) = Δ + f, [formula] for some [formula] and its general hyperplane section H is linearly normal. Then S is projectively normal with ~ pg = f and [formula].

From the linear normality of H, we get h0(H,OH(1)) = r and hence

[formula]

Therefore we have [formula] since [formula] and deg OH(1) = 2Δ - e = 2g(H) - 2 - (2f + e - 2). Thus OH(1) satisfies deg OH(1) > 2g(H) + 2 - 4h1(H,OH(1)). The condition f - 1 > 6e - Δ implies [formula]. Also the condition [formula] yields [formula]. Hence OH(1) is normally generated by Theorem [\ref=3.5.6], and thus its general hyperplane section H is projectively normal since it is linearly normal. Therefore S is projectively normal with q = 0, pg = h0(S,KS) = h1(H,OH(1)) = f > 1 since h1(H,OH(2)) = 0 from [formula].

If we consider the adjunction formula [formula] then KS.H = 2f + e - 2. Since |H + KS| is ample and pg > 0, we get KS.(H + KS)  ≥  0. Therefore we obtain

[formula]

by Propositon 2.0.6 (iii) in [\cite=Liv]. Thus [formula] by the Hodge index theorem K2SH2  ≤  (KS.H)2. Hence the theorem is proved.

Assume that (2f + e - 2)2  <  2Δ - e in the above theorem, then we have - 2f - e + 2  ≤  K2S  ≤  0. Observe the cases for K2S =  - 2f - e + 2 or 0, then we obtain the following result by using similar method in [\cite=Ak].

Assume |KS| has no fixed component with K2S = 0. Then S is minimal by adjunction formula and useful remark III.5 in [\cite=B]. Also the Kodaira dimension κ of S is at most one since K2S  ≤  0. Since pg > 1, S is nonruled and so κ  ≥  0. If κ = 0 then pg  ≤  1 by Theorem VIII.2 in [\cite=B] and thus κ must be 1. Hence by Proposition IX.2 in [\cite=B] there is a smooth curve B and a surjective morphism p:S  →  B whose generic fibre is an elliptic curve which means that S is a minimal elliptic surface of Kodaira dimension 1.

If K2S =  - 2f - e + 2. Let [formula] be the Remmert-Stein factorization of φH + KS and Ŝ = r(S). Then we can use Propositon 2.0.6 in [\cite=Liv] as stated in the proof of the previous theorem. And we obtain

[formula]

which yields Ŝ is a minimal model and KŜ  =  0, in other words, Ŝ is a K3 surface by using Propositon 2.0.6 (iv-1) in [\cite=Liv]. Also by Propositon 2.0.6 (ii) in [\cite=Liv], S is a surface blown up at 2f + e - 2 points on a K3 surface Ŝ since  - d = 2g(H) - 2 - (2Δ - e) = 2f + e - 2.
