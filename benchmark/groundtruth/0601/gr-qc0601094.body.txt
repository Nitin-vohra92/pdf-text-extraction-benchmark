A quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for the quasi-Kerr metric

There has been considerable recent interest [\cite=QKI] [\cite=QKII] [\cite=QKIII] [\cite=QKIV] [\cite=BWMB] [\cite=LazarusII] in the development and use of the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad. This is a Newman-Penrose null tetrad for a Petrov type I spacetime that will reduce to the Kinnersley tetrad as the spacetime reduces to the Petrov type D Kerr spacetime. There is any number of quasi-Kinnersley tetrads for a given spacetime and to obtain a quasi-Kinnersley tetrad it is only necessary to find a tetrad that satisfies this criterion [\cite=NerozziPrivate]. Whilst this means that a quasi-Kinnersley tetrad need not be transverse, i.e. have ψ1  =  ψ3 = 0 (indeed the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad given in [\cite=QKIV] for the Bondi-Sachs metric is not transverse), transverse tetrads are generally considered useful (the Weyl scalars ψ1 and ψ3 are frequently taken to be non-physical longitudinal effects, whilst ψ0 and ψ4 will carry the transverse, potentially radiating, effects), and the quasi-Kinnersley tetrads formally constructed in [\cite=QKI] and [\cite=QKII] are all transverse.

In any type I spacetime there are exactly three equivalence classes of transverse Newman-Penrose tetrads, where equivalent tetrads are related by a class III rotation (a 'spin-boost' Lorentz transformation). In only one of these equivalence classes does the radiation scalar ξ: = ψ0ψ4 [\cite=BeetleBurko] (defined for a transverse tetrad) go to zero when the speciality index [\cite=BakerCampanelli] goes to 1, its exact value in a Petrov type D spacetime. Members of this class are defined to be quasi-Kinnersley tetrads, and hence up to 'spin-boost' there is only one transverse quasi-Kinnersley tetrad.

The formal construction of the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad being a little involved, and a principal use of the frame being numerical, a simple explicit example may be helpful to clarify the ideas involved. Existing explicit examples include the (already mentioned) Bondi-Sachs metric [\cite=QKIV], the Kasner spacetime [\cite=QKIII], and the Hartle-Thorne metric [\cite=FWthesis]. In addition, [\cite=LazarusII] gives and uses a recipe for constructing the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for any spacetime obtained using a 3+1 ADM numerical evolution, assuming a Kerr final state. Here we give a quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for the recently proposed [\cite=Glamp] quasi-Kerr metric, a particularly appropriate and straightforward case since the original Kinnersley tetrad is itself for the Kerr metric.

Glampedakis and Babak [\cite=Glamp] (henceforth GB) are deliberately agnostic about the source of their quasi-Kerr metric, it is put forward as a practical scheme which may be useful in the analysis of future LISA data for assessing the deviation of an observed object from the Kerr metric. In addition, the quasi-Kerr metric may be useful in the development of a 'quasi-Teukolsky' scheme in which the small deviation (of the quasi-Kerr metric) from the Kerr metric, and from Petrov type D, may allow analysis of the evolution equations for the perturbed Weyl scalars. (Teukolsky's classic result [\cite=Teukolsky] for a type D spacetime relies on the decoupling and separation of the equations for the perturbations carried by ψ0 and ψ4.) A quasi-Kinnersley tetrad may be useful in this task.

The quasi-Kerr metric is the Kerr metric with an 'extra piece' added to the quadrupole moment, and is constructed as follows. The Kerr metric is a two parameter (mass and angular momentum) axisymmetric stationary exact solution of the Einstein Equations, accepted as describing the exterior of a rotating black hole. The Hartle-Thorne (HT) metric [\cite=Hartle1],[\cite=Hartle2] is a three parameter (mass, angular momentum and quadrupole moment) axisymmetric stationary approximate solution of the Einstein Equations for a rotating (neutron) star, constructed as a truncation at second order of a perturbative expansion in the rotation rate. Putting one of the three HT parameters equal to a function of another (i.e. relating the quadrupole Q and angular momentum J by Q =  - J2 / M) reduces the exterior HT metric to the Kerr metric truncated at first order in the angular momentum. The quasi-Kerr metric can be thought of in two ways, either that it is the full Kerr metric plus the part of the HT quadrupole term which is additional to the Kerr quadrupole term, or that it is the HT metric with the all the higher order (in a) Kerr terms added in. GB write Here Ml and Sl are the mass and current multipole moments, the hab are the terms added in order to modify the quadrupole moment, and superscript K refers to the Kerr metric. To find the hab, the HT metric as given in the original papers must first be put into the Boyer-Linquist (BL) coordinates as used in the Kerr metric; the transformation from BL to HT coordinates is given in [\cite=Hartle2] (note sign error, corrected in [\cite=BWMB]) and GB obtain the inverse transformation in a simple way. The coefficients of the quadrupole moment are then extracted and the parts equal to the quadrupole terms in the Kerr metric are subtracted. In BL coordinates {t,r,θ,φ} the result, here in the covariant as opposed to the contravariant form given by GB, is : where F1(r) and F2(r) are functions of r defined by GB, and P2( cos θ) is the usual Legendre polynomial. It is important to note that in calculations with the quasi-Kerr metric, all terms of order O(εa,ε2) are discarded. Terms such as these have been removed from the metric definition (equation ([\ref=metricDef])) in order to ensure that the quadrupole be the only moment altered.

To write down a quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for the quasi-Kerr metric we simply add on to all the vectors of the Kinnersley tetrad for the Kerr metric in BL coordinates a term proportional to ε, for example where p0, x0 and y0 are functions of r and θ, and subscript K labels vectors of the Kinnersley tetrad for the Kerr metric. Finding the 16 unknown functions (always discarding terms of order O(εa,ε2)) is straightforward. First, the NP tetrad conditions

[formula]

are solved for 10 of the unknown functions. The remaining six free functions correspond to the freedom to carry out a Lorentz transformation at first order in ε. Simply setting all of these six free functions to zero does result in a quasi-Kinnersley tetrad, but it is not transverse : it does not have ψ1  =  ψ3 = 0. A transverse tetrad can be found by simply calculating the Weyl scalars in the tetrad that we have so far, with all six free functions non-zero but unspecified, and solving the two complex equations ψ1  =  ψ3 = 0 for four of the free functions. The result is that three of the four are set to zero and the fourth becomes a function of the hab. The remaining two free functions (of r and θ) are the coefficients of ε in lt and [formula], and correspond to the freedom to carry out a class III tetrad rotation (at first order in ε) whilst remaining in the equivalence class of all transverse quasi-Kinnersley tetrads related by class III rotations.

The original Kinnersley tetrad for the Kerr metric is picked out of its equivalence class by setting the spin coefficient [formula] to zero. Note subscript sc to distinguish the spin coefficient from the perturbation parameter. Here, calculating εsc and setting the real and imaginary parts to zero yields the r dependence of the remaining two free functions (since the equations to solve are partial differential equations), leaving two free functions of θ only. These correspond to the fact [\cite=QKI], which follows directly from the definition of εsc, that εsc remains equal to zero under type III rotations with parameters p that both satisfy [formula]. Here the rotation is at first order, and the condition on the parameters becomes simply p = p(θ). As yet lacking a physical interpretation to tie down this remaining freedom, we here put both the remaining free functions of θ to zero for simplicity. The final expressions for the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for the quasi-Kerr metric are then The non-zero Weyl scalars in this tetrad are : It is immediately obvious that as the spacetime approaches the type D Kerr spacetime (i.e. ε  →  0), the vectors of the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad approach those of the Kinnersley tetrad and the Weyl scalars approach the known expressions for the scalars in the Kinnersley tetrad of the Kerr metric, i.e. the only non-zero Weyl scalar is ψ2  =  M / (r - ia cos θ)3. It is straightforward to check that all the spin coefficients also approach their Kerr expressions.

The speciality index S [\cite=BakerCampanelli] is a tetrad invariant quantity equal to 1 (only) in a Petrov type D spacetime. In a transverse tetrad it can be calculated as

[formula]

Here we get

[formula]

This expression for S for the quasi-Kerr metric is in fact the same as that for the Hartle-Thorne metric given in [\cite=BWMB]; recall that ε  =  (QKerr - Q) / M3 and note that the coordinate transformation from BL to HT coordinates is not needed here since, as GB point out, either set of coordinates can be used in O(J2,Q) terms. In fact, moving to the symmetric tetrad (using a class III rotation to put ψ0  =  ψ4), truncating terms zeroth order in ε to first order in a, and using the coordinate transformation as appropriate, we recover the expressions for the Weyl scalars and vectors of the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for the Hartle-Thorne metric as given in [\cite=BWMB] and [\cite=FWthesis] respectively . We have hence found a far more straightforward and transparent route to the explicit expressions for these quantities than previously used.

Note that in the expression for S the first non-zero term in ε has been retained despite the fact that it is higher order than terms retained in the metric components and all other quantities we have calculated (it is straightforward to check that the addition of terms in aε and ε2 to the Weyl scalars does not alter the result for S). This form of S arises simply because the definition of S is quadratic in the Weyl scalars and because here ψ0 and ψ4 have no zeroth order terms. As pointed out in [\cite=BWMB], an S of 1 at first order does not necessarily imply that the spacetime is type D at first order, since there may be four distinct principal null directions at this order. (An example of this is given in [\cite=FWthesis] where an explicit calculation shows that at first order there are indeed four distinct principal null directions for the Hartle-Thorne metric, while the speciality index deviates from 1 only at second order. See also [\cite=Cherubini].)
