Affine Configurations and Pure Braids

Introduction

The aim of this note is to establish a new link between discrete geometry and classical concepts in topology. Configurations of vectors can be understood with the help of Grassmannian manifolds equipped with a stratification controlled by matroids [\cite=BS]. Similarly, affine configurations yield stratified Grassmannians whose structure is determined by affine oriented matroids. The decomposition provided by Schubert cells of a Grassmannian has striking equivalent formulations in terms of convex polyhedra and of matroids [\cite=GGMS]. Affine analogues of these results have been pursued in [\cite=ABM] [\cite=BMO], where the focus there lies in understanding the combinatorics of these polyhedral structures. We will show that the topology of based loops of certain affine configurations can be explained using braids.

A braid should be thought of as a system of k strings which do not intersect and have fixed start and end points. Let Xk and Yk be the sets [formula] and [formula] in [formula], respectively. Consider a smooth embedding βi of an interval I into [formula] such that βi(0) lies in Xk and βi(1) in Yk. Denote by β a collection of k such embeddings βi, each one starting from a distict point in Xk and ending in a distinct point in Yk, such that the projection to the z coordinate is decreasing as t runs from 0 to 1 in I. We also require that βi(t)  ≠  βj(s) for every t,s in I and i  ≠  j, which means we obtain disjoint images and the strings do not intersect.

Definition A braid b is an isotopy class of a β as described above.

Braids form a group Bk [\cite=Ar] and each braid b permutes the order of Xk to a new order in Yk. When this order remains unchanged, i.e. the permutation is trivial, we say b is a pure braid. It is easy to see that pure braids form a subgroup Pk. The fundamental group of the space of k-tuples of distinct points in the plane is isomorphic to the pure braid group Pk [\cite=FN]. The centre of Pk is the infinite cyclic group Zk, generated by the element Δk.

The spaces of affine configurations of flats in affine and projective spaces were defined in [\cite=ABM]. Following the same notation we consider [formula], the space of distinct (  ≠  ), oriented (  →  ) affine classes of sets of k points in the real affine plane. For simplicity we will refer to this space as Ak.

Theorem 1. For k  ≥  5, [formula].

This can be seen as a variation of the classical result about the configurations of distinct points in the plane and the pure braid group mentioned above. It allows results from braid groups to be translated into results about affine configurations. For example, the conjugacy problem for braids is solvable [\cite=Gar], therefore the isomorphism above implies that the conjugacy problem for homotopy classes of based loops of oriented affine configurations in the plane is also solvable. In principle there exists an algorithm to decide whether or not two such loops are conjugate.

Suppose X is a topological space and let Homeo(X) denote the group of self-homemorphisms of X. Let Homeo0(X) and Homeo+(X) be the subgroups which consist of homeomorphisms which are isotopic to the identity and those which preserve orientation, respectively. Define the pure mapping class group of X as Homeo+(X) / Homeo0(X).

The group Pk is isomorphic to the pure mapping class group of the disk D2 minus k points [\cite=Bir], we can now establish another isomorphism. From Theorem 4.5 in [\cite=Han] it follows that the pure mapping class group of the sphere S2 with k + 1 punctures is Pk  /  Zk. Therefore we obtain for k  ≥  5,

Corollary  2. The fundamental group of Ak is isomorphic to the pure mapping class group of the sphere S2 punctured k + 1 times.

We will show that the group [formula] is isomorphic to a free group with eleven generators. This can be seen by using the combinatorial decomposition of the affine configuration spaces, as outlined in [\cite=ABM] and [\cite=BMO]. Notice that the configuration space A3 consists of a single point.

Proofs

Let 〈p1,p2,...,pk〉 be the affine span of the set {p1,p2,...,pk}, where [formula]. Define

[formula]

In other words, we are considering the sets of k points in 2 which are not all co-linear and hence span the real plane affinely. The group [formula] of orientation preserving affine transformations of [formula] acts freely on Ek. We denote the quotient of Ek under this action by [formula], in [\cite=ABM] it is denoted by [formula]. We call Ak the space of oriented affine configurations of n distinct points in the real plane. It was shown in [\cite=BMO] that [formula] is a principal fibre bundle.

Theorem 1. For k  ≥  5, [formula].

Consider the exact sequence of homotopy groups associated to the principal fibre bundle [formula],

[formula]

Note that [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], because [formula] retracts to SO(2). Say the generator of [formula] is g. Since group morphisms send generators to generators we have,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the standard space of configurations of distinct ordered k-points in [formula].

Notice that g, as a path in [formula], can be represented as a continuous full rotation of the plane.

Take [formula], for θ∈[0,2π] to be a representative of g. Then the path [formula] rotates the plane by one whole turn, and hence also rotates the points {p1,...,pk} by one whole turn. Therefore [formula] is identified with Δk under the classical identification of [formula] with Pk, where Δk is the generator of the centre Zk of the pure braid group Pk. This implies,

[formula]

We now claim that for k  ≥  5 the fundamental group of Ek is isomorphic to the pure braid group Pk.

Consider the smooth inclusion [formula], and note that both Ek and Fk are smooth submanifolds of [formula], because they are the complements of a collection of closed subspaces of codimension 2. Furthermore, Ek is a smooth submanifold of Fk. Similarly [formula] is a smooth inclusion. We will show that the complement of Ek in Fk has dimension k + 2. The claim [formula] will follow from the general fact that when a smooth submanifold Nn of dimension n in a smooth manifold Mm of dimension m , with m - n  ≥  3 then the inclusion

[formula]

induces an isomorphism on the fundamental groups

[formula]

so that [formula].

Notice Fk is an open subset of [formula], which means [formula]. An element of Fk  -  Ek is a k-tuple of points {p1,...,pk}, all of which lie on the same line in [formula]. First we will use the real projective plane [formula] minus a point to parametrise free lines in [formula]. Let P be the plane [formula], for [formula] consider the plane through the origin which is normal to l and call it [formula]. Denote the intersection [formula] by l', then ↦  l' is the homeomorphism that parametrises free lines in [formula] by elements of [formula] minus the element corresponding to the z axis (and [formula]).

Since the k-tuple {p1,...,pk} is allowed to move freely within the line l, it can be described as an open subset of [formula]. Hence [formula], and we are left with 2k  -  (k + 2)  ≥  3  ⇔  k  ≥  5. Which implies that [formula] when k  ≥  5.

Now from the exactness of the sequence of homotopy groups we obtain that [formula] is isomorphic to Pk  /  Zk.

Notice that a presentation for [formula] can be obtained from a standard presentation of Pk adding a new relation that comes from Δk.

In [\cite=BMO] it was shown that [formula] is homeomorphic to [formula]. Taking the double orientation covering we can see [formula] is homeomorphic to S2 and it has the polyhedral structure of the truncated cube.

Then A4, which in the notation of [\cite=ABM] is [formula], is homeomorphic to S2 minus the vertices of the truncated cube. Because these vertices correspond to configurations where two points pi and pj coincide, i.e. pi = pj for i,j = 1,2,3,4. Hence A4 is homeomorphic to S2 minus 12 points, which correspond to the vertices of the truncated cube. Therefore the fundamental group of A4 is isomorphic to the free group generated by 11 elements.

Question: Can the cohomology of Ak be computed using the principal fibre bundle
