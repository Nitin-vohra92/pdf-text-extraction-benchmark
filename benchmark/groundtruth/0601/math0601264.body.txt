Automorphisms of Regular Algebras

All vector spaces and algebras are over a ground field [formula] of characteristics 0. We adopt the Einstein convention of summing on repeated an upper and a lower indices except when these are in brackets, e.g. there is no summation in Q(i)(i).

N-Homogeneous Algebras

A N-homogeneous algebra is an algebra of the form [\cite=RB1], [\cite=BDVW]

[formula]

where E is finite dimensional vector space, T(E) is the tensor algebra of E and (R) is the two-sided ideal generated by a vector subspace [formula]. Since the space R is homogeneous by ascribing the degree 1 to the generators in E one obtains that the algebra A is graded, [formula], generated in degree 1, [formula] and such that the degrees An are finite-dimensional vector spaces.

The dual A! of A = A(E,R) is defined to be the N-homogeneous algebra [formula] where [formula] is the dual vector space of E and [formula] is the annhilator of R, [formula] . One has (A!)!  =  A.

Given two N-homogeneous algebras A = A(E,R) and A' = A(E',R') one defines the N-homogeneous algebra

[formula]

where πN is the permutation

[formula]

Following Manin's monograph[\cite=YM1] on quadratic algebras R. Berger, M. Dubois-Violette and M. Wambst[\cite=BDVW] introduced the corresponding semigroup [formula] of the endomorphisms of the N-homogeneous algebra A. The semigroup end(A) is canonically endowed with the structure of bialgebra with a coproduct Δ and counit ε given by

[formula]

The algebra A is a left comodule of [formula] for the coaction[\cite=BDVW]

[formula]

The semigroup end(A) alone has not enough relations in order to allow for an antipode. In order to obtain the quantum matrix group(the group of the automorphisms of A) we shall proceed by "adding the missing relations"[\cite=YM1], considering also the semigroup end(A!) of the endomorphisms of the dual A!.

The algebra A! becomes a left comodule of the semigroup [formula] in the following way. Let us identify the upper and the lower indices in A! with the help of the bilinear form gij  =  δij, ξi  =  gijξj  =  ξi. A left coaction on A! is given by

[formula]

where end(A!)g is end(A!) up to a move of the indices (by g). We shall not distinguish end(A!)g and end(A!), thus A! is a left end(A!)-comodule.

Let us consider the bialgebra e(A)(again in the spirit of [\cite=YM1]) having relations those of the semigroups end(A) and end(A!), in which the generators uij, [formula] have been identified [formula], i.e., we consider the bialgebra

[formula]

which is quotient of the bialgebra end(A) (and end(A!)). The algebras A and A! are left e(A)-comodules in a natural way.

Regular Artin-Schelter Algebras

The question that we address in the Talk is when an algebra A is "good" quantum space, in the sence that the space of its endomorphism e(A) is a Hopf algebra, i.e., there is a quantum group of the symmetries of the quantum space A?

Artin and Schelter have considered a class of regular algebras with very "good" homological properties [\cite=AS](we use here the equivalent definition of [\cite=YM2]).

A graded algebra [formula] with [formula], generated by A1, dim A1  <    ∞   is called regular if:

i) A has polynomial growth, (i.e., gk-dim A  =  γ  <    ∞  ),

ii) it is Gorenstein, i.e., there is a finite free resolution of the trivial right A-module [formula], such that its dualized complex (by [formula]) is a finite free resolution of the trivial left A-module [formula]. The length of this resolution is called dimension of A.

Manin suggested [\cite=YM2] that the regular algebras are good candidates for quantum spaces. The regular algebras of dimension 2 are exhausted by the Manin plane yx - qxy = 0 and the Jordanian plane xy - yx - y2 = 0 (given in the Introducion of [\cite=AS] as simple examples).

The classification of the regular algebras A of dimension 3 which is done in [\cite=AS] is much more involved and requires some new technics; it turns out that a regular algebra A of dimension 3 is either quadratic (N = 2) or cubic (N = 3) homogeneous algebra, A = A(E,R), generated by two elements satisfying two cubic relations, or else by three elements with three quadratic relations. Further the classification is based on the fact that a regular algebra A has an intrinsic description in terms of an invariant element ω(A) of degree N + 1 in the generators, i.e., in terms of a tensor with N + 1 indices(Proposition (2.4) of [\cite=AS]). The invariant tensor ω(A) transforms as the coordinates of 1-dimensional space of the the maximal non-vanishing degree A!m of A!

[formula]

Thus the invariant ω of the algebra A can be written in either of the ways

[formula]

where fj and gi = Qjifj are two bases of R. By change of the basis the matrix Q is amenable to the Jordanian canonical form. Artin and Schelter have proven that the case of Q diagonal matrix is generic, in the sense that the non-diagonal matrices Q do not give new regular algebras. On the components of ω(A) = ωIξI∈A!N + 1 is defined the cyclic action

[formula]

under which ω splits into orbits. If the multiindex [formula] belongs to an orbit of the cyclic action of order n, i.e., if σn(J) = J then ωJ  =  0 or else [formula]. An algebra A in the classication of the regular algebras of dimension 3 is characterised by the data (Q,ω), the diagonal matrix Q and the invariant ω (see Table (3.9) and (3.11) in [\cite=AS]) where are listed 6 families of cubic algebras (types A,E,H,S1,S2,S2') and 7 types of quadratic algebras(types A,B,E,H,S1,S1',S2).

The cubic class S1 contains the universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra [\cite=AS] with two generators (then coinciding with the Yang-Mills and related algebras [\cite=AC.MDV1], [\cite=AC.MDV2]) as well as the algebras related to the parastatistics [\cite=D-VP].

Koszul Complexes for N-Homogeneous Algebras

To every N-homogeneous algebra A one associates canonically the Koszul complexes L(A) and K(A) [\cite=BDVW], [\cite=BM](see also [\cite=AC.MDV1], [\cite=AC.MDV2]) as follows.

Let us introduce the element c, independent of the choice of basis

[formula]

and the linear mapping d defined by the left multiplication of c,

[formula]

In view of the definition of [formula] the canonical element satisfies cN = 0, which implies dN = 0. In other words the mapping d is a N-differential mapping and the sequence of spaces [formula] is a N-complex (for details we send the reader to [\cite=BDVW], [\cite=BM]).

The Koszul cochain complex [formula] is defined to be the complex [\cite=BDVW]

[formula]

with degrees given by

[formula]

and differential mapping [formula],

[formula]

The jump in the degrees (when N > 2) [formula], n(2i) = Ni and n(2i + 1) = Ni + 1, is due to the fact that the complex L(A) is a contraction of an underlying N-complex [\cite=BDVW].

The Koszul chain complex [formula] [\cite=BDVW] can be defined as the dualized complex of the cochain complex L(A), K(A) = HomA(L(A),A) with degrees

[formula]

and differential [formula] defined by d' on K2i and d'N - 1 on K2i + 1 where d' is the mapping

[formula]

for which d'N = 0 holds. The dualization (by [formula]) of the Koszul chain complex K(A) gives back the cochain complex, L(A) = HomA(K(A),A).

It was shown in [\cite=BDVW] (using contraction of N-complexes) that the notion of Koszul algebra has a meaningful generalization for N-homogeneous algebras; a N-homogeneous algebra A is said to be Koszul algebra when its Koszul chain complex K(A) is acyclic in positive degrees [\cite=BDVW]. The Koszul chain complex K(A) of a Koszul algebra A provides a free resolution of the trivial left module [formula], property which we shall use right now.

Homological Quasi-Determinant

We are ready to introduce the analog of the determinant for a regular Koszul N-homogeneous algebra A. Let A be N-homogeneous Koszul and regular of dimension D. Then the Koszul chain complex K(A) ([\ref=Kosc]) of A provides a free resolution of the left A-module [formula] with length D and the Gorenstein property implies that the complex L(A) ([\ref=coKosc]) provides a resolution of the trivial right A-module [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

thus the cohomology group A!max of L(A) is a 1-dimensional e(A)-comodule.

The bialgebra e(A) of a regular Koszul N-homogeneous algebra A coacts on A!max by the element D  =  D(A)

[formula]

which we are referring to as the homological quasi-determinant.

For the quadratic algebras N = 2, the homological quasi-determinant D coincides with the Manin's homological determinant [\cite=YM1].

Let us denote the one-dimensional comodule A!max as [formula]. If the coefficient κ  =  ωAωA is invertible then the homological quasi-determinant D of the bialgebra (e(A),Δ,ε) reads

[formula]

The element D of e(A) is group-like, [formula] and ε(D) = 1.

Proof: In components the coaction of the bialgebra e(A) on the 1-dimensional comodule ω∈A!m ([\ref=qdet]) reads

[formula]

Multiplying of both sides by ωB and summing on the multi-index B yields

[formula]

which for invertible κ implies the quasi-determinant formula ([\ref=cqdet]). The coproduct and the counit on a monomial uAB is given by [formula] and ε(uAB) = δAB hence

[formula]

For the quasi-determinant D there exist an expansion on rows and on columnes which gives rise to the Cramer adjoint elements (analogues of subdeterminants).

The left SL(ukj) and right SR(ukj) Cramer adjoint elements are such elements of the bialgebra (e(A),Δ,ε) that the following holds

[formula]

Automorphisms of Regular Algebras of Dimension 3

The regular algebras of dimension 2, i.e., the Manin and the Jordanian plane are Koszul algebras. The quadratic and cubic regular algebras of dimension 3 [\cite=AS] are also Koszul algebras [\cite=RB1],[\cite=BM] which allows to define their homological quasi-determinants D coinciding with the usual quantum determinants [\cite=YM1] for N = 2, but giving something new for cubic algebras N = 3.

From now on A will stay for a regular (quadratic or cubic) algebra of dimension 3 of the Artin-Schelter clasification, specified by its data (Q,ω) [\cite=AS]. We put the accent on the cubic Artin-Schelter algebras, but the quadratic ones fit into the same description, which allows for their simultaneous treatment.

In our construction of the antipode on the bialgebra e(A) the Cramer adjoint elements will be instrumental.

A regular algebra A of dimension 3 will be referred to as generic regular algebra when the coefficients κi (i) are invertible

[formula]

The bialgebra e(A) for a generic A will be referred to as generic bialgebra.

The equation κi = 0 for some i (equivalent to i = 0 in view of the cyclicity ([\ref=cycl])) singles out the non-generic algebras.

One easily checks that the regular cubic algebras A of type E,H and some points of the types A, S1 and S2 are not generic.

Let A be a generic regular algebra of dimension 3. The left(right) Cramer adjoint elements of the bialgebra e(A) are given by

[formula]

Proof: For a generic bialgebra e(A) one has ωAiωAj  =  κiδij with κi  ≠  0 hence

[formula]

The right Cramer adjoint element are handled similarly due to ωiAωjA  =  jδij. [formula]

Let A be a generic regular algebra of dimension 3. The left SL(uij) and the right SL(uij) Cramer adjoint elements in the bialgebra e(A) are proportional

[formula]

with coefficient a constant h(i)(j) being an element of the multiplicatively antisymmetric matrix

[formula]

Proof: Taking into account the cyclicity σ(κi) = i  =  (Q(i)(i))2κ(i) one can bring the expression ([\ref=cramer]) for the SL(uij) to the form of SR(uij) which gives the result. [formula]

For the generic regular cubic algebra A which are our main concern here the formula ([\ref=h]) yields

[formula]

with h = 1 for A of cubic types A and S1, h =  - 1 for S2 and h =  - 2 / 3 for S2'.

The quasi-determinant D  =  D(A) of the bialgebra (e(A),Δ,ε) of a generic regular algebra A is a quasi-central element

[formula]

Proof: By expansion of D on the RHS and regrouping the terms we get

[formula]

Note that the cancelation of the index k in h(i)(k)h(k)(s) = h(i)(s) is crucial for resummation of the terms. [formula]

Let A be a generic regular algebra of dimension 3[\cite=AS]. Let us denote by (H(A),Δ,ε) the bialgebra (e(A),Δ,ε) extended by the inverse element D- 1, DD- 1  =  D- 1D  =  1  1e(A) and consider the linear antihomomorphism

[formula]

Then (H(A),Δ,ε,S) is a Hopf algebra with an antipode given by S.

Proof: The bialgeba structure of e(A) is compatible with the antipode, if they satisfy the antipode axiom

[formula]

where m is the product and η is the unity mapping of the algebra e(A), η:1  ↦  1  1e(A). The existence of the left SL and right SR Cramer adjoint elements for e(A) of a generic algebra A(Proposition 1) implies that the antipode S constructed by SL or SR satisfies the axiom ([\ref=ax]) which makes the bialgebra e(A) a Hopf algebra.[formula]

The antipode S(D) of the quasi-determinant D is evaluated by the axiom ([\ref=ax])

[formula]

where we used [formula] and ε(D) = 1 (Lemma [\ref=quasidet]). Thus S(D) = D- 1.

Conclusions

We have constructed the Hopf algebra H(A) of the automorphisms of a generic regular algebra A of dimension 3, or in other words the quantum matrix group for the quantum space A.

The quantum matrix groups H(A) for a quadratic A are contained in the Ewen and Ogievetsky classification [\cite=EO] (see also[\cite=O]) of the GL(3) quantum matrix group. The quantum groups H(A) for the cubic regular algebras A of dimension 3 are to the best of our knowledge new ones (first reported by the author in [\cite=TP]).

One expects that all H(A) have polynomial growth. It is natural for the automorphism group H(A) of an algebra A with dimension 3 to expect gk-dim H(A) = 9 = 32. as it happens for the quadratic algebras. Surprisingly one has gk-dim H(A) = 7 for some cubic A, e.g. of type S2.
