Introduction

Quantum dynamical semigroups (QDS), i.e. C0-semigroups of completely positive (CP) contractive maps on C* or von Neumann algebras (assumed to be normal in the von Neumann algebra case), are important objects both from physical and mathematical viewpoint. It is thus quite natural to look for a nice classification scheme for them. As in every branch of mathematics, one would like to find one or more computable (preferably numerical) invariants for QDS with respect to some suitable equivalence relation, which is by now accepted as the so-called cocycle congugacy introduced and studied in a series of papers by Arveson ([\cite=Arv1],[\cite=Arv2],[\cite=Arv3]), Powers [\cite=Pow], Bhat ([\cite=Bh1],[\cite=Bh2]) and others. There has already been a considerable amount of literature on this problem as well as the related (and in some sense equivalent) problem of classifying product system of Hilbert modules, thanks to the intesive works by a number of mathematicians including Arveson, Bhat, Skeide, Tsirelson, Barreto, Liebscher, Verschik, to name only a few (see, e.g. [\cite=Arv1], [\cite=Sk_etal], [\cite=Sk2] and references therein). However, while much is known about QDS on B(H) (where H is a separable Hilbert space), and a nice numerical invariant ('Arveson index', see, e.g. [\cite=Arv2] )is available in this case, QDS on other types of von Neumann algebra are not so well understood, in the sense that there is not yet any satisfactory numerical (or easily computable) invariant for QDS (or, equivalently, product systems of Hilbert modules) on general von Neumann algebras. In order to construct such invariants, it is reasonable to first restrict attention to just a single CP map insetead of semigroup of CP maps. This is what we attempt to do in the present article for the hyperfinite type II1 factor. While we are not yet able to come up with a satisfactory numerical invariant for an arbitray normal CP map on the hyperfinite II1 factor, we do get a nice invariant for an interesting class of CP maps, namely the 'pure' ones. This invariant, though not numerical, is given by a quadruplet (m,ν,b1,b2) where m is a nonnegative integer (so can be thought of as an analogue of 'Arveson index' in this case), ν is a measure (with suitable property) on the two-torus [formula], and [formula] are unitary valued ν-measurable maps. Thus, the invariant is in some sense not a very abstract object, and easily computable. It can be described at least by a sequence of complex numbers, if we describe the measure ν as well as the bounded functions z  ↦  bi(k,l): = (k,l)  -  th  ~  entry  ~  of  ~  ~ bi(z), ~ i = 1,2, in terms of the Fourier coefficients. Apart from the pure CP maps, we also study in some details another class which we call 'extendible'. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for extendibility, and propose some invariants for such CP maps, including numerical invariants.

Preliminaries

Intertwiner Module

Let [formula] be a Hilbert space, [formula] be a von Neumann algebra. Given a normal unital CP map T:A  →  A, by Stinespring's and KSGNS theorems (see [\cite=Lan]) we can obtain a Hilbert von Neumann A  -  A bimodule (to be called KSGNS bimodule) [formula] for some Hilbert space KT, a normal representation πT:A  →  L(ET)  ⊆  B(K) and ξT∈ET such that [formula] Here 〈ξ,η〉: = ξ*η is the A-valued inner product on ET and πT(A)ξTA is total in ET which implies that [formula] is total in KT. Setting [formula] by

[formula]

we get a normal representation ρT of A such that πT(A) and [formula] commute and the Hilbert (right) module ET coincides with the intertwiner module [formula] (c.f. [\cite=Gos],[\cite=Ski]) of [formula], which is given by :

[formula]

Let B∈L(ET). For [formula] we have

[formula]

Since [formula] is total in KT, [formula]

For the converse, let [formula] For [formula] and ξ∈ET we have

[formula]

This implies that Bξ is in the intertwiner module ET.

Let us now introduce various equivalence relations on the set CP(A) of normal unital CP maps. From now on, unless there is a specific need to mention, we shall omit the adjectives 'normal CP unital'.

The following equivalence relation is motivated by the definition of cocycle conjugacy for QDS.

We say that two elements T,S of CP(A) are equivalent, denoted as T  ≈  S, if there exist unitaries u,v in A, such that for all a∈A,

[formula]

We also introduce another (stronger) equivalence relation ~  .

T  ~  S if there exists unitary u∈A such that S(a) = T(u*au) for all a∈A.

If S  ≈  T as above, we have

[formula]

where ξS  =  πT(u)ξTv. So the corresponding KSGNS bimodules can be chosen to be the same, say, E, and ξS = WξT for some unitary W∈L(E).

It is not unreasonable to identify two CP maps if the KSGNS bimodules are isomorphic, i.e. can be chosen to be the same. This leads to the third equivalence relation.

We say that T and S in CP(A) are KSGNS-equivalent, to be denoted by [formula], if the bimodules ET and ES are isomorphic.

It is clear from our discussion that [formula]. However, the converse implications can be shown to be false in general.

Second order irrational rotation algebra and its representations

Fix an irrational number θ, and consider the irrational rotation algebra Aθ, (c.f. [\cite=Dav]), which is the universal C*-algebra generated by two unitaries U and V satisfying the Weyl commutation relation UV = λVU, where λ = e2πiθ. Let τ be the unique faithful normalized trace on Aθ and [formula] 1 ), be the associated GNS triple. From now, we fix the von Neumann algebra A as the (unique upto isomorphism) hyperfinite type II1 factor, identified with the weak closure of Aθ in B(Hτ). It is well-known that Aθ is isomorphic with the crossed product [formula], with respect to the action described in [\cite=Dav]. Define the unitary operators Ul,Vl,Ur and Vr in B(Hτ) by Ula = Ua, ~ Vla = Va, ~ Ura = aU and Vra = aV for a∈Aθ  ⊆  Hτ. It is clear that the C*-algebras C*(Ul,Vl) and C*(Ur,Vr) are weakly dense [formula]-sub-algebras of A and [formula] respectively. The vector 1 is cyclic and separating both for A and [formula]

Consider the [formula]- sub-algebras Al,fin and Ar,fin of A and [formula] respectively, where Al,fin is the unital [formula]-algebra generated by all polynomials in the unitaries Ul and Vl, and Ar,fin is the similar algebra obtained by replacing Ul,Vl by Ur,Vr respectively. Clearly, Al,fin is norm-dense in Aθ. Moreover, let Afin denote the [formula]-algebra of [formula] generated by polynomials in all the four unitaries Ul,Vl,Ur and Vr and B be the C* algebra obtained by completing Afin in the norm-topology of [formula].

By definition, the crossed product C*-algebra [formula] with respect to the action α is the universal C *  algebra generated by four unitaries W1,W2,W3,W4 satisfying

[formula]

It can be vriefied by a straightforward calculation that the linear map [formula] defined by

[formula]

gives the required isomorphism.

From the general theory of C* crossed product, it is easy to show that [formula] is simple, and thus any nonzero representation is a C* isomorphism. Thus, the C* algebras B, [formula] and C*(Ul,Vl,Ur,Vr)(  ⊆  B(Hτ)) are all canonically isomorphic, and we shall identify them whenever there is no chance of confusion, and shall call this C* algebra the 'second order irrational rotation algebra', and denote it by A(2)θ. It is actually the 4-dimensional noncommutative torus in the sense of Rieffel and Schwarz [\cite=Rief], corresponding to the skew-symmetric 4  ×  4 matrix A = ((aij)), with a12 = a34  =  θ,a21 = a43 =  - θ, and all other entries are zero. Moreover, from the proof of the above Lemma, it is clear that the map η gives an algebraic isomorphism between Afin and the [formula]-algebra generated by Wi, i = 1,...,4.

The weak closure of the C*-algebra A(2)θ in the weak topology inherited from [formula] is [formula] which is again a concrete realization of the (unique upto isomorphism) II1 hyperfinite factor, with the faithful normal trace τ(2) given by the vector state [formula]. We introduce here some notation for future use. We denote by ξ0 the vector [formula], and by c(r) (where [formula]) the operator of right multiplication by c on [formula], i.e. c(r)b: = bc, for [formula], viewed as an L2-element. The commutant of [formula], i.e. [formula], coincides with the set [formula]. We shall use the notation τ(2)(X) for 〈ξ0,Xξ0〉 whenever it makes sense, even when the operator X is unbounded but contains ξ0 in its domain.

Now we make an important observation regarding extension of representations.

Let us give a sketch of the proof for Al,fin only. The proof for Afin is similar. Let [formula] be a representation. Thus, we have two unitaries π(Ul) and π(Vl) acting on [formula], satisfying the commutation relation π(Ul)π(Vl) = λπ(Vl)π(Ul). Since the commutative C*-algebra [formula] is the universal C*-algebra generated by a unitary, we can get a representation π0, say, of [formula] which maps [formula] to f(π(Ul)). Clearly, (π0,π(Vl)) is a covariant representation for the action (m  ·  f)(z): = f(λmz), and thus, there exists a representation [formula] ([formula]) into [formula] satisfying (Ul) = π(Ul),(Vl) = π(Vl).

Irreducible representations of A(2)θ

Following [\cite=Bre], we say that a separable representation π of the irrational rotation algebra Aθ has the uniform multiplicity m if the restriction of π to [formula] has uniform multiplicity [formula] The factor representations (in particular, the irreducible representations) are in above class. In [\cite=Bre], the author gave a nice invariant of uniform multiplicity representation on the irrational rotation algebra Aθ. These representations are classified by their multiplicities m, a quasi-invariant Borel measure ν (where quasi-invariance is with respect to rotation by the angle 2πθ) and a unitary one-cocycle b. It is not difficult to verify that the arguments of [\cite=Bre] can easily be extended to the 2-nd order irrational rotation algebra A(2)θ. We summarize this fact as a theorem below, the proof of which is omitted since it is very similar to the proofs of analogous results in [\cite=Bre].

(i) Any irreducible representation of [formula] is unitarily equivalent to a representation of the form π(m,ν,b1,b2) described below, where [formula], ν is an ergodic regular Borel measure on [formula] which is also quasi-invariant with respect to the action α of [formula] given by α(n1,n2)z = (λn1z1,λn2z2), and two ν-measurable unitary valued functions [formula] such that [formula] is given by:

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the measure νn1,n2 given by

[formula]

with respect to ν. Note that νn1,n2 is equivalent to ν as ν is quasi-invariant. (ii) Two irreducible representations π(m,ν,b1,b2) and π(,,,). are unitarily equivalent if and only if

m =  and ν  =   can be chosen;

there exists a unitary-valued, ν-measurable map [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Invariants for CP maps on type II1 factor

State associated with CP map

Given a normal CP unital map T on the type II1 factor A, consider the associated KSGNS bimodule ET, cyclic element ξT∈ET, and the representations πT,ρT discussed in section 2. Now we define a representation [formula] by

[formula]

This is a homomorphism since πT(a) and [formula] commute. By Proposition [\ref=poly-cont], the restriction of [formula] to the weakly dense subalgebra Afin extends to the C*-algebra A(2)θ, and we denote this extension again by the same notation. Since πT(A)ξTHτ is dense in KT, and 1 is cyclic for [formula], it is clear that ξT1∈ is cyclic for ([formula]). We define a state ψT on A(2)θ by setting

[formula]

Since T is defined also on [formula], we shall define ψT on [formula] too, given by the same expression as in ([\ref=psidef]). Note that we have, [formula]. It is clear from the construction of ψT that (KT,T,ξT ~ 1) is a choice of GNS triple for ψT. Thus, for two CP maps T,S∈CP(A), the corresponding state ψT and ψS have unitarily equivalent GNS representations if and only if T and S are unitarily equivalent. This leads to the following observation.

Suppose first that [formula], and U is an A-linear unitary from ET to ES satisfying UπT(a)U*  =  πS(a) for all a∈A. Using the fact that {ev ~ : ~ e∈ET, ~ v∈Hτ} and {ev ~ : ~ e∈ES, ~ v∈Hτ} are total in KT and KS respectively, it is easy to verify that the map U:KT  →  KS defined by

[formula]

extends to a unitary in the Hilbert space sense, and UπT(a)U*  =  πS(a), [formula] for all [formula], which means that UT(  ·  )U*  =  S(  ·  ).

Conversely, given a unitary U:KT  →  KS such that UT(  ·  )U*  =  S(  ·  ), we can define U:ET  →  ES by

[formula]

where e∈ET is viewed as an element of B(Hτ,KT). This is easy to prove that U is an A-linear unitary map, which also intertwins the left actions on the two modules, and thus ET and ES are isomorphic as bimodules.

We now want to chracterize the states on A(2)θ which are of the form ψT for some T∈CP(A). Let us denote by Sτ the set of all states ψ on A(2)θ such that (i) [formula] for all [formula]; and (ii) the restriction of the state ψ on [formula] admits a normal extension to A.

It is clear that for T∈CP(A), ψT is an element of Sτ. Let us first show that it is one-to-one. Let T and [formula] be two CP maps such that [formula] For any a∈Al,fin and [formula], we have

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

Since [formula] is total in Hτ it follows that [formula], hence for all a∈A.

Now we show that the map T  ↦  ψT is onto. Let ψ∈Sτ. We define a sesquililear form T(a) for a in the completion of Al,fin, i.e. Aθ, by the following, where [formula]:

[formula]

For [formula] in Ar,fin and [formula] in Al,fin, we have,

[formula]

Since ((b*ibj)) and ((a*iaj)) are positive in Mn(A) and [formula] respectively, and each ai commutes with each bj, it follows by standard arguments, similar to those used for proving the positivity of Schur product of two positive (numerical) matrices, that the right hand side of ([\ref=positive]) is positive. By the condition [formula], T(1) = 1. This, combined with the positivity of the right hand side of ([\ref=positive]), suffices to show that T(a) extends to a bounded map from Aθ to B(Hτ), to be denoted by the same symbol again. It is also easy to see that T is CP and [formula] Finally, as the resriction of the state ψ on [formula] is normal it follows that the map T extends as a normal CP unital map on A.

Invariant for a pure CP map

An element T∈CP(A) is said to be a pure CP map (see [\cite=Tsu], [\cite=Arv]) there does not exist any CP (not necessarily unital) normal map S on A, other than scalar multiples of T, such that T - S is CP.

First we note that the state ψT is a pure state if and only if the GNS representation T is irreducible. Since T is constructed out of two commuting representations πT and ρT, the irreducibility of T is translated into the fact that [formula] is trivial.

Now, it suffices to prove that T is pure if and only if [formula] is trivial. This fact can be deduced from Corollary 3.7 of [\cite=Tsu] by some straghtforward argumemts, or by a direct argument along the lines of the proof of a similar fact for states as in [\cite=Tak].

Thus, given any pure CP map T on A, the state ψT is a pure state on the 2-nd order irrational rotation C*-algebra A(2)θ, i.e. its GNS representation T is irreducible. Theorem [\ref=invcp] provides a quadruplet (m,ν,b1,b2), which is an invariant for the CP map T under the KSGNS equivalence [formula]. Moreover, it is a complete invariant for [formula] by Proposition [\ref=123]. It is also easy to see that if T is pure and S is KSGNS equivalent to T, then S must be pure.

For a measure μ on [formula], let us denote by μ1 and μ2 the marginals given by:

[formula]

where Δ is a Borel subset of [formula]. The resrtictions of the representations [formula] to the C*-algebra Aθ = C*(Ul,Vl) and C*(Ur,Vr) extend to normal representations of A and [formula] (respectively) by our assumption, so it is clear that the marginals ν1 and ν2 of the quasi invariant Borel measure ν on [formula] obtained above are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue mesure on [formula] In fact, as ψT coincides with the canonical trace τ on [formula], ν2 should be equivalent to the Lebesgue measure on the one-dimensional torus.

We summarise the above discussion in form of a theorem below.

A complete invariant for the set of pure CP maps on A under the KSGNS equivalence [formula] is given by the quadruplet (m,ν,b1,b2) as described in Theorem [\ref=invcp], with the additional conditions that ν1 is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and ν2 is equivalent to the Lebesgue measure.

Extendible CP maps

It should be noted that the state ψT associated to a CP map T may not extend to the von Neumann algebra [formula], since given a pair of normal representations π,ρ of A and [formula] respectively (acting on the same Hilbert space) such that π(a) and [formula] commute for all [formula], it is not in general possible to get a normal representation φ of [formula] such that the restrictions of φ to A and [formula] are respectively π and ρ. In the appendix, we have given a counterexample which justifies this remark. Now, we are going to investigate when ψT  ~   extends to the type II1 factor [formula] as a normal state. Let us call the map T extendible if ψT extends to a normal state on [formula], or equivalently, T extends to a normal representation of [formula]. To give a necessary and sufficient criterion for extendibility, we need the following general result.

Let us prove only the nontrivial part, i.e, the 'if' part. Consider the GNS triple (K,π,ξ) for the state φ, and denote by π0 and Uγ the restriction of π to C and π(δγ) respectively. It is enough to prove that π0 is normal. Consider a directed family [formula], where cα,c∈C. We have to show that

[formula]

Since the family π0(cα) is uniformly bounded (in operator norm) by [formula] (as 0  ≤  π0(cα)  ≤  π0(c)), it is enough to verify ([\ref=678]) for w belonging to the dense set D spanned by vectors of the form π0(c)Uγξ, with c∈C and γ∈Γ. Note that the set D is dense because ξ is cyclic for [formula].

Now, it can be verified by a simple calculation that

[formula]

by the assumption of weak continuity of φγ for every γ. This completes the proof.

For [formula], let ψkT be the bounded linear functional on the commutative C*-algebra [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let us denote by μkT the complex measure on [formula] corresponding to ψkT, i.e. [formula] From Proposition [\ref=extend], we conclude the following.

The CP map T is extendible if and only if for each [formula] the measure μkT is absolutly continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on [formula]

We end this subsection by mentioning a few examples of extendible maps. The verification of extendibility, using Theorem [\ref=ext], is quite straightforward, and we omit these calculations.

Invariants for extendible CP maps

Suppose that T is an extendible CP map, and let us denote the normal extension of ψT again by the same symbol. So, ψT is a normal state on [formula], which is also a type II1 hyperfinite factor, with the canonical trace τ(2)(  ·  ) = 〈ξ0,  ·  ξ0〉 (where [formula]). Recall also the notation c(r) for [formula], introduced earlier by us.

Since τ(2) is faithful normal on [formula], any normal state is absolutely continuous with restpect to τ(2). Thus, we can obtain a 'Radon-Nikodym derivative', which is a positive (possibly unbounded) operator DT affiliated to the commutant of [formula], i.e. [formula], such that [formula] and

[formula]

Note that DT is actually an element in [formula].

We now explain how DT can be used to get numerical invariants for the equivalence ~  . Suppose that S  ~  T, and let u∈A be such that S(a) = T(u*au) for all a∈A. By an easy calculation we see that

[formula]

where [formula]. Using the facts that [formula] commutes with ũ, and that ũξ0  =  ũ  =  ũ(r)ξ0, (where [formula] denotes right multiplication by ũ), we get the following :

[formula]

From this, we conclude (using the uniqueness of the Radon-Nikodym derivative) that

[formula]

So, in particular, τ(2)(e- tDS) = τ(2)(e- tDT) for all t  ≥  0. These numbers can be used as invariants for ~  . Another possibility is to use τ(2)(PT), where PT denotes the projection (in [formula]) onto the range of DT.

Let us conclude with a nice computable formula for τ(2)(PT) when DT is L2.

Note that DT∈L2 implies that ξ0∈Dom(DT), and thus, τ(2)(b) = 〈ξ0,bDTξ0〉 for all [formula]. Moreover, As DT is affiliated to [formula], e- tD leaves [formula] invariant. Hence Afinξ0 is a core for DT, hence {DTbξ0 ~ : ~ b∈Afin} is dense in Ran ~ D. Thus, we have,

[formula]

However, in this paper, we do not study these numerical invariants in more details, and do not investigate whether one or more of such invariants characterize the equivalence ~  . We leave these topics for future research. Appendix Here we give an example of a commuting pair of normal representations π and ρ of a von Neumann algebra A  ⊆  B(H0) and its commutant respectively, such that the representation Φ of [formula] defined by [formula] does not have a normal extension to the von Neumann algebra [formula]. To this end, let us take [formula] (with Lebesgue measure), and [formula]. Let [formula], where

[formula]

[formula], and l denotes the Lebesgue measure on [formula]. Define π and ρ from [formula] to B(H) by setting :

[formula]

for [formula]. We claim that [formula] given by [formula], does not admit a normal extension to [formula]. To see this, note that the set [formula] has zero Lebesgue measure as a subset of [formula]. Now, assuming, if possible, that Φ admits a normal extension on [formula], choose a sunction [formula] and define F0 in [formula] by setting F0(z) = 0 for z∈Γ, and F0(z) = F(z) for all z in the complement of Γ. Thus, F = F0 a.e. (Lebesgue), hence Φ(F) = Φ(F0). However,

[formula]

for every f∈L2(μ). Thus, Φ(F) = 0 for all [formula], contradicting the assumption that Φ extends normally.
