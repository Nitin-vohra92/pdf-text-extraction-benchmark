Introduction

Neutrino sector has many curious properties which are not shared by the quark and charged leptonic sectors. For example, neutrino masses are very small [\cite=WMAP] compared with those of quarks and charge leptons. The large mixing angles seen in the experiments of atmospheric neutrino oscillation and long baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiments (related to solar neutrino deficit) [\cite=SK1] [\cite=SK2] [\cite=SK3] [\cite=Kam1] [\cite=Kam2] [\cite=SNO1] [\cite=SNO2] are also new features, not seen in the quark sector.

It is well known that the seesaw mechanism [\cite=Yanagida] [\cite=Gell-Mann] [\cite=Mohapatra] can explain the small mass scale of neutrinos naturally. In this mechanism, neutrino mass matrix which describes the low energy observables is given approximately by

[formula]

where MD and MR are the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices of neutrino, respectively. The unpleasant overall minus sign can be absorbed by redefinition of field as ν  →  iγ5ν, i.e.

[formula]

If we require that the order of magnitude of MD is the weak scale and that of MR is the GUT scale, we can roughly obtain the desired order of magnitude of Mν.

In addition, this mechanism can also explain the large mixing angles in the leptonic sector inheriting the unification of lepton and quark sectors as is seen in SO(10) GUT. Especially, it has been pointed out in some articles (e.g. [\cite=Smirnov]) that there exist interesting and amusing relations between CKM and MNS matrices :

[formula]

These relations may imply that there exist some nontrivial relations between CKM and MNS matrices and that the seesaw mechanism has a comparatively simple structures as seen below.

To clarify our procedures, we use the following notations, i.e. MD and MR are diagonalized as

[formula]

where D and R are diagonalized Dirac and Majorana mass matrices, respectively and VL,R and U are unitary matrices. Using these notations in Eq.([\ref=numass1]), Mν can be written as

[formula]

where we define a unitary matrix, UR  =  VTRU. In SO(10) GUT, there are some nontrivial relations between quark and leptonic sectors and furthermore between VL and VR above the symmetry breaking scale, which we adopt in this work. This is because SO(10) includes a subgroup, G = SU(4)PS  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R. SU(4)PS symmetry leads to the relations between quark and lepton Yukawa coupling matrices, i.e.

[formula]

where the indices of u,d,ν,e correspond to up-type quark, down-type quark, neutrino, charged-lepton, respectively. In addition, SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R symmetry leads to left-right symmetry. Since the two indices to denote the matrix elements of Dirac-type mass matrix correspond to left- and right-handed neutrinos, this symmetry reduces the degrees of freedom of the matrix, i.e. it should be a symmetric matrix, and this leads to a relation

[formula]

For simplicity of the argument, we assume that these relations hold approximately at low energies. Adopting a certain basis in which the down-type quark mass matrix is diagonalized, the former relation in Eq.([\ref=su4]) leads to

[formula]

Then, we can rewrite Eq.([\ref=numass2]) as

[formula]

The r.h.s. of Eq.([\ref=numass3]) is furthermore diagonalized as

[formula]

where ν is the diagonalized neutrino mass matrix with mass eigenvalues μ1,μ2 and μ3. The matrix V†CKM  ×  O is what we call MNS matrix of leptonic sector

[formula]

In this way, the mixing matrix, VCKM, is accompanied by extra rotations by O, so that we can explain the disagreement between CKM and MNS matrices and the large mixing angles of leptonic sector once O contains large (maximal) mixing angles.

In this manuscript, we especially concentrate our attention on the relations found in Eqs.([\ref=rel1]),([\ref=rel2]). As we sketch right below, these relations are realized provided the extra rotations due to O are bi-maximal rotations around x- and z-axes. This may be natural since these relations are concerning 1  ↔  2 and 2  ↔  3 generation mixings.

According to an approximation proposed by Wolfenstein [\cite=Wolf], we can parametrize VCKM as

[formula]

where λ≃ sin θC and A,ρ and η are quantities of the order of unity. Roughly speaking, since the bi-maximal extra rotations shifts these angles to

[formula]

we can obtain the desired relations in Eq.([\ref=rel1]) and Eq.([\ref=rel2]).

We can easily understand the relation between CKM and MNS matrices geometrically. The explicit forms of VCKM and V†MNS with a standard parametrization are given by

[formula]

where we set [formula] and ignore CP phases tentatively. Decomposing these matrices to vector representations

[formula]

we can express these in vector space as shown in Fig.[\ref=figKMMNS]. We parametrize the orthogonal matrix O as O = Ox(Θ1)  ·  Oz(Θ3). Then, from the relation between CKM and MNS matrices, V†MNS = O†  ×  VCKM, we can easily see that [formula] is rotated around x-axis by Θ1 first and around z-axis by Θ3 next to get [formula]. Thus, we can roughly achieve the above relations, once Θ1 and Θ3 are (almost) maximal.

In what follows, we parametrize the unitary matrices UR by three mixing angles and five CP phases after absorbing one overall CP phase by the rephasing of fields, i.e.

[formula]

where we use a standard parametrization of VR [\cite=PDG] [\cite=Chau] [\cite=Harari] [\cite=Fritzsch] [\cite=Botella] in which three mixing angles, θR1,θR2,θR3, and one CP phase, δR, are embedded.

Throughout this manuscript, we perform analyses regarding the three mixing angles to be small, i.e. θR1,θR2,θR3  ≪  1. The reason can be understood as follows. For simplicity, let us first think about two generation case. In this case, the mass matrix, M = (D)VR(R)- 1VTR(D), can be explicitly written as

[formula]

where D = diag(m1,m2),R = diag(M1,M2) and we ignore all CP phases. The necessary and sufficient condition for this mass matrix to be diagonalized by a orthogonal matrix with maximal rotation, i.e. M = O  ·  ()  ·  OT and [formula], is M11  =  M22, which in turn leads to the following relation,

[formula]

We make a natural assumption that the Majorana mass eigenvalues have hierarchical structure, i.e. M1 / M2  ≪  1, while [formula] as expected by the quark-lepton symmetry in SO(10) GUT. Thus, we can approximate the mixing angle as

[formula]

Note that the requirement for maximal rotation is equivalent to the small mixing angle of Majorana mass matrix, once if we assume that the Majorana mass eigenvalues have hierarchical structure. Furthermore, we can estimate the order of magnitude of the mixing angle as

[formula]

It is interesting to note that the latter relation, [formula], is what we find in quark sector approximately (for Dirac masses, though). Being Inspired by this discussion, in the realistic three generation case, we regard the three mixing angles, θR1,θR2,θR3, to be small. Comparing with the data on neutrino oscillations, it turns out that the relations, [formula], hold well in the three generation analysis.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec.[\ref=two], we discuss the extra rotations, sketched above, more carefully and emphasize that we can not only realize the relation ([\ref=rel1]),([\ref=rel2]), but also derive the absolute values of neutrino masses, by comparing with the existing experimental data of neutrino oscillations. The effects of five CP phases which embedded in UR, i.e. εi,κi and δR, are discussed in Sec.[\ref=three].

Bi-maximal extra rotations and estimation of absolute values of neutrino masses

In this section, we investigate neutrino mass matrix by switching off the five CP phases for simplicity. Recalling Eq.([\ref=numass3]),

[formula]

we express the diagonalized mass matrices as

[formula]

and parametrize the matrix VR in a specific form by two rotations around y- and z-axes as

[formula]

In general, we should parametrize VR by three mixing angles as seen in Eq.([\ref=udef]). We, however, can achieve bi-maximal rotations with a minimal set of mixing angles as is seen in Eq.([\ref=vr]) and this can be understood as follows. Defining

[formula]

we can estimate diagonal terms as [formula] and off-diagonal terms as

[formula]

where we assume that these angles are extremely small as mentioned in previous section. Requiring that the order of magnitude of these quantities are unity, we find

[formula]

Using these naive estimations, we can easily find that the choice of VR in Eq.([\ref=vr]) just leads to the conditions that M22≃M33 and M'22≃M11 (where M'22 denotes a matrix element after rotating by Θ1), once we expand the allowed region of M1 to negative region (ε2 = 0 or π / 2). Using Eq.([\ref=vr]), we can express M as

[formula]

where we define s2  =   sin θR2 etc. Referring Eq.([\ref=massrel]), we can approximate M up to leading order as

[formula]

Requiring that Eq.([\ref=mass3]) can be diagonalized by O = Ox(Θ1)  ·  Oz(Θ3) with two rotations around x- and z-axes, we can immediately diagonalize Mν as

[formula]

where we define

[formula]

In what follows, we set Θ1 equals to [formula] as mentioned in the previous section and leave the degree of freedom of Θ3, because as seen in the following the former rotation around x-axis reduce the magnitude of λ as [formula] and Θ3 cannot be taken to be maximal.

Eventually, we find the relation between CKM and MNS matrices up to O(λ2) as follows.

[formula]

Then, comparing with standard parametrization of VMNS,

[formula]

we can immediately find the relations between observed mixing angles, i.e. θ12,θ23 and θ13, and Θ3,λ up to O(λ2) :

[formula]

Note that this model deduces the order of magnitude of θ13. Though this value is not so small for λ  =   sin θC, it is still not conflict with the experimental data from CHOOZ experiment, i.e.

[formula]

We can fix Θ3 using the experimental data of θsol(≃θ12). Combining this result with a constraint of the ratio on mass-squared differences from experimental data

[formula]

we can finally fix the remaining dimensionless parameter, x in Eqs.([\ref=rho]),([\ref=theta]), i.e.

[formula]

Note that there are possibilities that ρi's take negative values. We, however, can always define ρi to positive, thanks to the Majorana phases. Using the best fit values [\cite=global] :

[formula]

Θ3 is fixed as [formula] and we eventually find

[formula]

Combining Eqs.([\ref=theta]),([\ref=xdef]) with these values, we get

[formula]

It is worthwhile noting that the relations, [formula], have been realized. Note also that ρ3 is larger than O(1). We, however, confirm the validity of the approximation in Eq.([\ref=mass3]) since we expect that the order of magnitude of m1 / m2 is similar to mu / mc in up-quark sector from quark-lepton symmetry in SO(10) GUT. We cannot find any solutions in case of Δm2atm < 0, i.e. inverted mass spectrum case. In general, there are two possible cases reflecting the uncertainty of the sign of mass-squared difference in atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiment, normal or inverted mass spectrum, i.e. Δm2atm > 0 or Δm2atm < 0, respectively. There are some proposals to fix the sign of atmospheric neutrino mass squared difference, i.e. discrimination between normal mass spectrum and inverted one by utilizing the difference of matter effect of the earth between electron neutrino and electron anti-neutrino at Neutrino Factory[\cite=Albright] [\cite=Barger].

Then, we can find absolute values of neutrino masses by using the following equation,

[formula]

These equations lead to

[formula]

The effects of CP phases and the estimation of the Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay

In previous section, we neglect five CP phases, εi,κi and δR. In this section, we reanalyze neutrino mass matrix including all CP phases. At first, embedding δR into VR corresponds to

[formula]

This phase, however, is not a physical phase since in this paper we adopt the condition that θR1 equals to zero; the phase δR in the most left and the most right matrices in the above expression can be absorbed into κ1 and κ2, respectively. Therefore, we can concentrate our attentions on four CP phases, εi and κi. Next, the effect of embedding εi and κi into M corresponds to the substitutions,

[formula]

Using these substitutions, we can write down approximated expression of M = (D)UR(R)- 1UTR(D) referring to Eq.([\ref=mass3]) as

[formula]

When we diagonalize this matrix along to the same way in previous section, the conditions to satisfy Θ2 = 0 after rotation around x-axis (Θ1) are

[formula]

To maintain the statement that mi,Mi and θRi are defined by real numbers, we set κ1 =  - κ2 and regard κ1 as a CP phase which embedded in mixing matrix Ox(Θ1), i.e. e±  iκ1 sin Θ1. Thus, we can achieve correct diagonalization of Mν maintaining mi,Mi and θRi real numbers. This phase, κ1, has a physical meaning as seen below. The diagonalized mass matrix is written as

[formula]

and MNS matrix can be written as

[formula]

Rewriting

[formula]

the effect of κ1 is always suppressed by O(λ2), so that we can follow the same procedure with Eq.([\ref=vrot]) up to O(λ). Then, the right phase term shifts the arguments of 3 as arg(3)  →  arg(3) - 2κ1. This phase has no effect on the absolute value of 3rd neutrino mass but appears in some phenomena in which observables are relevant to the Majorana phases, e.g. neutrinoless double beta decay mentioned latter in this paper.

Eventually, we can write the correct diagonal mass matrix Mν as

[formula]

Note that there remain three physical parameters, ε1,κ1 and x, and the phase ε2 does not appear explicitly, since it is not a independent parameter through 3, i.e. arg(3) =  - 2(ε1  +  ε2), as seen in Eq.([\ref=rho]).

Furthermore, setting Θ1 equals to [formula], the absolute values of Eqs.([\ref=rho1b]),([\ref=rho2b]),([\ref=rho3b]) are

[formula]

Setting [formula] and substituting these into |3|3 - |2|2  -  Δ- 1(|2|2 - |2|1) = 0, we can easily solve this equation analytically. The result is shown in Fig.[\ref=figxphase].

Using above analytical solution, we can also estimate the absolute values of neutrino masses, |1|,|2| and |3| by using the following equation,

[formula]

and the obtained results are shown in Fig.[\ref=figmassphase]. We find that there exist allowed values of |i| for any values of ε1 in case of Δm2atm > 0 while we cannot find any allowed values of |i| in case of Δm2atm < 0. We can find that the result shown in Fig.[\ref=figmassphase] has complicated structure in certain region of ε1, i.e. 1.39 < ε1 < 1.75 (the shaded area corresponds to this region). This is because as seen in Fig.[\ref=figxphase] there are two or three solutions of x for ε1, there are also multi solutions of |i| for ε1 in this region. We discriminate these solutions to three parts in Fig.[\ref=figmassphase3].

Next, we deduce the Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments [\cite=Joaquim]. Defining arg(i) = αi and Using Eq.([\ref=numasscp1]), we can write Mν as

[formula]

where we neglect the overall phase. The two remaining phases, α1  -  α2 and α1  -  α3 + 2κ1, are known as "Majorana phases". The definition of Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments is

[formula]

In general, this quantity has two independent CP phases and especially for the case of normal mass spectrum, |mee| can take zero accidentally in certain region of |1|, 1.88  ×  10- 3 < |1| < 5.97  ×  10- 3. We, however, already found in Fig.[\ref=figxphase] that the phase ε1 depends on x in this model and this means that one Majorana phase, α1  -  α2, is a function of |1| shown in Fig.[\ref=figmaxphase]. On the other hand, the other Majorana phase, α3  -  α1 - 2κ1, is completely independent phase reflecting the uncertainly of κ1. Therefore, we expect that the uncertainly of |mee| by these two phases are strongly suppressed. The numerical results of |mee| are shown in Fig.[\ref=figmajomass]. We find in this figure that the allowed region of |mee| is suppressed considerably compared with the general case.

This figure can be understood as follows. In general, |mee| can be written

[formula]

and the schematic view of the relation between these quantities are shown in Fig.[\ref=figschmajo]. The necessary condition to minimize |mee| is

[formula]

We, however, can find in Fig.[\ref=figmaxphase] that the maximal values of α1  -  α2 are significantly smaller than the general case in most of the region.

Conclusion

In this paper, we discuss the extra rotations induced by additional diagonalization of Majorana mass matrix and derive the absolute values of three neutrino masses and Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment only invoking to the seesaw mechanism collaborated by the unification of neutrino Dirac mass matrix with that of up-type quarks and the left-right symmetry based on SO(10) GUT.

We specify these extra rotations to bi-maximal rotations around x- and z-axes and find that these extra rotations can explain the interesting and nontrivial relations between CKM and MNS matrices. In this analysis, we find the specific value of θ13, which does not conflict with the experimental data at 3σ C.L.

In Sec.[\ref=two], we ignore CP phases for simplicity and find that the absolute values of neutrino masses satisfy m1:m2:m3  ≈  1:2:8, i.e. neutrino masses have hierarchical structure, and that there is no solution in the case of inverted mass spectrum.

In Sec.[\ref=three], we reanalyze the absolute values of neutrino masses and Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment, by including all CP phases. In this analyses, we find that only two CP phases, ε1 and κ1, remain as independent degrees of freedom. The former phase has a physical meaning both in the analyses of the absolute values of neutrino masses and Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment, while the latter phase appears only in the analysis of Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. In the analysis of the absolute values of neutrino masses, we cannot decide them uniquely but find these quantities have well-defined lower bounds though we cannot find any solutions in the case of inverted mass spectrum. In the analysis of Majorana mass responsible for the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment, we find that one Majorana phase is a function of |1| and that this reduces the allowed region of |mee| considerably.
