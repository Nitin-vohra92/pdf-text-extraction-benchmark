Equilibrium points of logarithmic potentials on convex domains

Introduction

A number of recent papers [\cite=CER] [\cite=ELR] [\cite=LaRo] [\cite=LaRo2] have concerned zeros of functions

[formula]

and in particular the following conjecture [\cite=CER].

Let f be given by (), where ak  >  0 and

[formula]

Then f has infinitely many zeros in [formula].

The assumptions of Conjecture [\ref=conj1] imply that f is meromorphic in the plane and, assuming that all zk are non-zero, f(z) is the complex conjugate of the gradient of the associated subharmonic potential [formula]. Moreover, Conjecture [\ref=conj1] has a physical interpretation in terms of the existence of equilibrium points of the electrostatic field arising from a system of infinite wires, each carrying a charge density ak and perpendicular to the complex plane at zk [\cite=Kellogg]. Conjecture [\ref=conj1] is known to be true when [formula] as r  →    ∞   [\cite=CER] (see also [\cite=GO]), and when inf {ak}  >  0 [\cite=ELR] (see also [\cite=LaRo]).

An analogue of Conjecture [\ref=conj1] for a disc was advanced in [\cite=borcea].

Let 0  <  ρ  <    ∞   and [formula]. Let f be given by (), where

[formula]

Then f has infinitely many zeros in |z|  <  ρ.

If f satisfies the assumptions of Conjecture [\ref=conj2] then [formula] in |z|  <  ρ, where [formula]. Obviously there is no loss of generality in assuming that ρ  =  1 and θ  =  0 in Conjecture [\ref=conj2]. Writing

[formula]

where

[formula]

it is easy to verify that Conjecture [\ref=conj2] is equivalent to the following.

Let F be given by (), where

[formula]

Then F has infinitely many zeros in Re  w  >  1 / 2.

With the assumptions ([\ref=7]), the function F(w) in ([\ref=6]) is evidently meromorphic in the plane. In §[\ref=example] an example satisfying ([\ref=6]) and ([\ref=7]) will be constructed, such that F(w) has no zeros in [formula]. Thus Conjectures [\ref=conj2] and [\ref=conj3] are false, and there is no direct analogue of Conjecture [\ref=conj1] for the unit disc.

On the other hand the following theorem shows in particular that if the zk converge to ρeiθ sufficiently rapidly, and if all but finitely many zk lie in a sufficiently small Stolz angle, then the conclusion of Conjecture [\ref=conj2] does hold. It is convenient to state and prove the result when the zk lie in a convex domain D and the boundary point ρeiθ is 1. There then exists (see §[\ref=pfthm1]) an open half-plane H such that D  ⊆  H and 1 lies on the boundary ∂H, and there is no loss of generality in assuming that H is the half-plane Re  z  <  1.

Let [formula] be a convex domain such that 1∈∂D. Let f be given by (), where

[formula]

Assume that 1 is a limit point of the set [formula], and that there exist real numbers ε  >  0 and λ  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then there exists a sequence (ηj) of zeros of f satisfying ηj∈D, lim j  →    ∞ηj  =  1.

Note that ([\ref=4'']) implies that [formula] has no limit points z in the punctured disc A given by 0  <  |1  -  z|  <  ε, and that f is meromorphic on A. Moreover, ([\ref=4''']) is obviously satisfied if λ  <  1.

A counterexample to Conjecture [\ref=conj3]

Let

[formula]

Then g has no zeros, but has simple poles at 0, 2 and

[formula]

Straightforward computations give

[formula]

and, using ([\ref=9]),

[formula]

Then b and the ck evidently satisfy

[formula]

Next, let

[formula]

By ([\ref=8]), ([\ref=9]), ([\ref=10]), ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=13]) the function h(w) is meromorphic in the plane, and L(w) is an entire function.

Let m be a large positive integer, let R  =  4mπ, and use c to denote positive constants independent of m. Then simple estimates give

[formula]

and, as m  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=15]) and ([\ref=16]) shows that [formula] in ([\ref=14]), so that h  =  g has no zeros, and applying the residue theorem in conjunction with ([\ref=15]) now gives

[formula]

Hence h(w) may be expressed using ([\ref=17]) in the form

[formula]

By ([\ref=9]), ([\ref=13]) and ([\ref=18]) the function F(w)  =  wh(w) may be written in the form

[formula]

Here F evidently satisfies the requirements of ([\ref=6]) and ([\ref=7]), but F has no zeros in [formula], since h has no zeros and h(0)  =    ∞  . Remark. It is conjectured further in [\cite=borcea] that if f satisfies ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) with [formula] for each k then f has infinitely many zeros in [formula]. The example ([\ref=18']), with ak  =  dkvk and [formula], shows that this conjecture is also false.

An auxiliary result needed for Theorem [\ref=thm1]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] rests upon the following proposition, which concerns functions in the plane of the form ([\ref=6]), and uses standard notation from [\cite=Hay2].

Let 0  <  σ  ≤  1. Let F be given by (), where

[formula]

Assume that the set [formula] is unbounded and that there exist real numbers R  >  0 and λ  ≥  0 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then there exists a transcendental meromorphic function G with

[formula]

and the Nevanlinna deficiency δ(0,G) of the zeros of G satisfies δ(0,G)  <  σ. In particular, F(w) has a sequence of zeros tending to infinity.

The zero-free example of ([\ref=18']) has λ  =  1 and δ(0,F)  =  σ  =  1, and all its poles lie in Re  w  ≥  1, so that Proposition [\ref=prop1] is essentially sharp.

To prove Proposition [\ref=prop1], assume that F is as in the statement of Proposition [\ref=prop1]. It follows from ([\ref=7'']) that the set [formula] has no limit points w with R  <  |w|  <    ∞  . In particular, F is meromorphic in the region 2R  ≤  |w|  <    ∞   with an essential singularity at infinity. The existence of a transcendental meromorphic function G satisfying ([\ref=t0]) then follows from a result of Valiron [\cite=Valiron] (see also [\cite=Bie]). In particular, G is constructed [\cite=Valiron] so that F and G have the same poles and zeros in |w|  ≥  2R. If |w|  ≥  4R then ([\ref=7']) gives

[formula]

so that

[formula]

as r  →    ∞  , by [\cite=GO]. Since the poles wk of G have exponent of convergence at most λ by ([\ref=7'']), it follows that G has lower order μ  ≤  λ.

Choose s0,s1,s2 with

[formula]

where s is as in ([\ref=t1]) and satisfies s  ≤  π / 2 by ([\ref=7']). The proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1] requires the following two lemmas.

The function F satisfies [formula].

Let r  >  0 and write wk  =  uk  +  ivk with uk and vk real. Let

[formula]

Then ([\ref=7']) gives pk(r)  >  0 and there exists d  >  0 such that p1(r)  >  d / r as r  →    ∞  . Hence, again as r  →    ∞  ,

[formula]

There exists M1  >  0 such that |F(w)|  ≤  M1 for all large w lying outside the region | arg w|  <  s0.

This follows from ([\ref=7']), ([\ref=t1]) and ([\ref=sj]), since there exists a positive constant M2 such that |w  -  wk|  ≥  M2|wk| for all such w and all [formula].

The proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1] may now be completed using Lemmas [\ref=lem0] and [\ref=lem1]. Assume that δ(0,G)  ≥  σ. Then Baernstein's spread theorem [\cite=baernstein] gives a sequence rm  →    ∞   and, for each m, a subset Im of the circle |w|  =  rm, of angular measure at least

[formula]

using ([\ref=t1]) and ([\ref=sj]), and such that

[formula]

Let m be large, and consider the function v(w)  =   log |F(w)|, which is subharmonic on the domain

[formula]

Then v is bounded above on Ω, by Lemma [\ref=lem1]. But the intersection Jm of Im with the arc [formula] has angular measure at least 2(s2  -  s1), so that standard estimates for the harmonic measure of Jm at -  rm / 2 now give

[formula]

where M3 is independent of m. Since ([\ref=t0]) implies that ([\ref=t2]) holds with G replaced by F, combining Lemma [\ref=lem1] with ([\ref=t3]) and the two-constants theorem [\cite=Nev] leads to

[formula]

But ([\ref=t4]) contradicts Lemma [\ref=lem0], and this completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

Assume that f and D satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. Define F using the transformations ([\ref=5]) and ([\ref=6]). Then F satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition [\ref=prop1] with R  =  1 / ε and σ  =  1. Thus F has a sequence of zeros tending to infinity, and so f has a sequence (ηj) of zeros with lim j  →    ∞ηj  =  1.

It remains only to show that such a sequence (ηj) exists with, in addition, ηj∈D, and this is done by a standard argument of Gauss-Lucas type. Let η  =  ηj with j large, and assume that [formula]. Since D is convex the supremum and infimum of arg (z  -  η) on D differ by at most π. Hence there exist an open half-plane H, with D  ⊆  H and η∈∂H, and a linear transformation u  =  T(z)  =  (z  -  η) / a mapping H onto Re  u  >  0. Writing uk  =  T(zk) then gives

[formula]

This contradiction completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].
