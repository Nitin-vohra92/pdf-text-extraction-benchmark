Density profile of a trapped strongly interacting Fermi gas with unbalanced spin populations

In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mechanism, the onset of superfluidity is associated to pairing between two fermionic species with matched Fermi levels. This scheme is relevant to systems like metal superconductors, superfluid 3He or ultra cold gases, as observed in recent ground breaking experiments [\cite=Jochim03] [\cite=Zwierlein03] [\cite=Greiner03] [\cite=Bourdel04] [\cite=Kinast04] [\cite=Partridge05b]. However, other physical systems, like magnetized superconductors or neutron stars, require the understanding of fermionic superfluidity in the presence of mismatched chemical potentials. The nature of superfluidity in these systems have been the subject of longstanding debates [\cite=Sarma63] [\cite=Fulde64] [\cite=Larkin65], which have been renewed by the opportunity to address this topic experimentally using gaseous samples. Various mechanisms were proposed to describe the ground state of an ensemble of fermions with mismatched Fermi levels: deformed Fermi surface [\cite=Sedrakian05], FFLO (Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin, Ovshinnikov) states, where Cooper pairs acquire finite momentum, and their generalization to trapped systems [\cite=Combescot05] [\cite=Mora05] [\cite=Castorina05], interior gap superfluidity [\cite=Liu03], or phase separation between a normal and a superfluid state through a first order phase transition [\cite=Bedaque03] [\cite=Caldas05] [\cite=Carlson05] [\cite=Cohen05]. When the strength of the interactions is varied, a complicated phase diagram mixing several of these scenarios is expected [\cite=Pao05] [\cite=Son05] [\cite=Sheehy05].

Extending the seminal observation of fermionic superfluidity in ultra-cold atom systems, two recent experiments [\cite=Zwierlein05] [\cite=Partridge05] have started probing the regime of mismatched Fermi levels by cooling samples containing different atom number in each spin state. In this paper we will focus on the results presented in [\cite=Partridge05] where the authors studied the density profile of a gas of fermionic lithium when varying, in the regime of strong interactions, the population imbalance between the two trapped spin states. One the most striking results is displayed in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. It shows that the radius of the minority component is strongly reduced with respect to the one of non-interacting gas with the same atom number. In the present paper, we propose an interpretation of this result on the basis of the existence of first order phase separation between the normal and superfluid components and the use of universality in the strong interaction regime. We show that these two ingredients are sufficient to provide a good quantitative agreement with experimental data. It is therefore complementary to recent studies of [\cite=Pieri05] [\cite=Yi06] [\cite=Silva06] [\cite=Haque06], who address the same topics using a more complicated formalism.

Our analysis is based on the assumption of the existence of a zero temperature first order phase transition between a fully polarized normal phase containing a single spin species and an "unpolarized" superfluid state composed of a balanced mixtures of the two species. The existence of this phase transition was suggested by previous theoretical studies [\cite=Bedaque03] [\cite=Caldas05] [\cite=Carlson05] and is based on the following qualitative argument: In the grand canonical ensemble, the chemical potentials μi of the two species are fixed. In the ground state, the system minimizes the grand-potential [formula], where H is the hamiltonian of the system and Ni is the population of species i. Let us now consider a situation where the chemical potentials are mismatched, with δμ  =  μ1  -  μ2 > 0. Promoting a particle from state 2 to state 1 decreases the grand potential by δμ but implies the breaking of a pair, hence increases the energy by the superfluid gap Δ. When [formula] we therefore expect the system to be unpolarized, while above this threshold a fully polarized system is obtained.

At zero temperature, the actual position of the phase transition can be found analytically in the case of a homogeneous unitary gas by matching chemical potentials and pressures in the two phases [\cite=Carlson05]. Indeed, we can write in the unpolarized phase n1 = n2 = f(μ1,μ2). Using the thermodynamical identity ∂μ1n2  =  ∂μ2n1, we deduce that f can actually be expressed as a function of μ = (μ1  +  μ2) / 2 only. To obtain the exact expression for f, we then consider the case of matched Fermi surfaces, μ1  =  μ2  =  μ. In this latter case, universality at the unitary limit allows one to write μ  =  ξEF, where EF  =  2(6π2n)2 / 3 / 2m is the Fermi energy of a non-interacting gas of density n = n1,2 and ξ is a universal parameter whose determination has attracted a lot of attention from both theoretical [\cite=Carlson03] [\cite=Perali04] [\cite=Astrakharchik04] [\cite=Carlson05] and experimental groups [\cite=Bourdel04] [\cite=Bartenstein04] [\cite=OHara02] [\cite=Kinast05] [\cite=Partridge05] and is now thought to be ξ  ~  0.45. Using this expression for the chemical potential, we then deduce that

[formula]

Gibbs-Duhem identity dPS = n1dμ1 + n2dμ2 finally yields for the pressure in the superfluid phase

[formula]

In the normal phase, we assume only the majority component is present. We have then an ideal gas constituted of particles of type 1 with chemical potential μ1, thus giving

[formula]

Equating PN and PS [\cite=SurfaceTension], we see that the two phases coexist only if μ1 and μ2 satisfy the condition μ2  /  μ1  =  ηc with

[formula]

a relation already found in [\cite=Carlson05] [\cite=Cohen05]. In a trap, the chemical potential depends on position.

To compare with experiments, we now consider the case of a cloud of atoms trapped in a harmonic potential [formula]. Without loss of generality, we will restrict our analysis to the case of a isotropic trap with frequency  = (ωxωyωz)1 / 3. We can indeed always recover the more general anisotropic case by making the scaling transform xi  →  ωixi  /  .

To calculate the density profile of the cloud, we make use of the local density approximation, where we assume that the chemical potential of species i depends on position as [formula].

If we assume component 1 is the most populated, the inner superfluid region is defined by the condition [formula] and is bounded by the radius R2 defined by

[formula]

Atoms of the minority species are located in the paired superfluid phase only. We thus have

[formula]

where 2 = (μ01  +  μ02) / m2 and

[formula]

Excess atoms of the majority species are located between r = R2 and r = R1 such that m2R21 / 2 = μ01. The number of excess atoms is therefore [formula], hence

[formula]

Dividing by ([\ref=Eqn5]) by ([\ref=Eqn4]) yields the implicit equation for η0  =  μ02  /  μ01 as a function of N1 / N2

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Eqn6]) is solved numerically and the value obtained for η0 is then used to calculate the radii R1 and R2. The predicted evolution of the Ri versus the population imbalance P = (N1 - N2) / (N1 + N2) is shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig1]. To follow Ref. [\cite=Partridge05], we have normalized each Ri to the Thomas-Fermi radius RTF associated to an ideal gas containing Ni atoms. The agreement with the experimental data is quite good as soon as [formula], a remarkable result, since the model presented here contains no adjustable parameter, as soon as the value of ξ is known.

For weak population unbalance, experimental variations of the radii is flatter than predicted by the first order transition model. As proposed in [\cite=Partridge05], this suggests that the phase separation does not happen exactly at P = 0, but above some threshold Pc  ~  0.1. This point is strengthened when one compare the theoretical and experimental density profiles. As in [\cite=Partridge05], we have represented in Fig. [\ref=Fig2] the integrated column density [formula] for P = 0.57 (as in Fig. 2.D of [\cite=Partridge05]). We immediately see in this figure that the transition between the two phases is very sharp, by contrast to what is observed experimentally. Finite temperature might explain this discrepancy. Indeed, for low population imbalance, the superfluid phase extends nearly throughout all the cloud, and in particular in regions where the density, hence the Fermi energy, is very low. In the unitary regime, the critical temperature for the superfluid-normal transition is given by the scaling kBTc  =  αEF, with α  ~  0.2 [\cite=Bulgac05]. It may then happen that near the cloud edge, the temperature T of the sample becomes locally larger than Tc. If this condition is satisfied at a radius Rc smaller than the demixing radius R2, then the first order transition to the fully unpaired state will not happen. If we introduce the Fermi temperature TF  =  (6N1)1 / 6 / kB associated to a number of atoms N1, the superfluid/normal and paired/unpaired transitions will happen at the same position if T / TF satisfies the condition

[formula]

In fig. [\ref=Fig3], we have plotted as a function of temperature the evolution of the critical imbalance under which no demixing is expected. Experimentally, demixing only happens in the conditions of [\cite=Partridge05] for [formula], which, according to eq. [\ref=Eqn7], corresponds to [formula], a value compatible with experimental data. Despite a semi-qualitative agreement, this finite temperature argument needs to be clarified by a more careful analysis, following for instance the work presented in [\cite=Yi06]. Others scenarios can also be envisioned to explain the smooth crossover between the two phases, such as the existence of an intermediate phase - e.g. a gapless or FFLO phases as proposed in [\cite=Son05] -, or a breakdown of the local density approximation due to the fast variation of the density profile. Nevertheless, the good agreement between theory and experiment for the data presented in fig. [\ref=Fig1] suggests that the crossover region between paired and unpaired phases should remain relatively narrow.

From the analysis presented here, it appears that the observations of [\cite=Partridge05] are consistent with a scenario of a transition between a fully paired and a fully polarized phases separated by a narrow crossover region probably related to finite temperature effects breaking the superfluid phase before demixing may occur. Interestingly, if this thermal scenario was confirmed the measurement of the critical population unbalance under which no phase separation happens could provide a useful tool for fermion thermometry. Another issue not addressed here is related to the superfluid character of the system when the population imbalanced is varied. This is especially important if one wishes to understand the results presented in [\cite=Zwierlein05] where it is shown that a mismatch of the Fermi surfaces by about 50% leads to a breakdown of superfluidity.
