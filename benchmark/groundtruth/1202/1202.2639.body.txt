Low-overhead surface code logical H

It has been noted previously that the surface code permits low-overhead implementations of logical H [\cite=Fowl08] and logical S [\cite=Alif07] [\cite=Jone10] implying it can efficiently implement the entire Clifford group as it possesses an efficient logical CNOT. Here we present an improved implementation of logical H and describe it in far greater detail that has been done before. We assume basic familiarity with surface code quantum computing [\cite=Raus07] [\cite=Raus07d] [\cite=Fowl08]. We have chosen an explicit presentation of a distance 7 example over a generic arbitrary distance presentation as we believe the distance 7 example is minimum size when assuming a lattice of equally spaced logical qubits. Lower distance logical H, including distance 3, is possible, however more space is required around the manipulated distance 3 logical qubit than is available in a minimum spacing lattice of distance three logical qubits.

Previous implementations of surface code logical H required braiding and significant space around the logical qubit [\cite=Fowl08]. Our new implementation is described in Figs. [\ref=Hadamard_A]-[\ref=Hadamard_K] and does not suffer either of these drawbacks.
