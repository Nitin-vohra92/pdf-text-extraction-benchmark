Non-abelian symmetries of quasitoric manifolds

Introduction

A quasitoric manifold is a smooth connected orientable 2n-dimensional manifold M with a smooth action of an n-dimensional torus T such that:

The T-action on M is locally standard, i.e. the T-action is locally modelled on the standard T-action on [formula].

If the first property is satisfied, then M / T is naturally an n-dimensional manifold with corners. We require that the orbit space of the T-action on M is face-preserving homeomorphic to an n-dimensional simple polytope.

Quasitoric manifolds were introduced by Davis and Januszkiewicz [\cite=0733.52006] in 1991. A symplectic 2n-dimensional manifold with an hamiltonian action of an n-dimensional torus is an example of a quasitoric manifold. We call such a manifold a symplectic toric manifold.

In this paper we construct a maximal compact connected Lie-subgroup of the homeomorphism group of M which contains the torus T. To be more precise, we have the following theorem.

Let M be a quasitoric manifold. Then there is a compact connected Lie-subgroup G of [formula] which contains the torus T such that:

G acts smoothly on M for some smooth structure on M.

If [formula] is another compact connected Lie-subgroup which contains the torus T and acts smoothly on M for some smooth structure on M, then G' is conjugated in [formula] to a subgroup of G.

If the G- and G'-actions are smooth with respect to the same smooth structure on M, then G' is conjugated in [formula] to a subgroup of G.

If M is a symplectic toric manifold, then G is conjugated in [formula] to a subgroup of the symplectomorphism group of M.

A smooth structure on M for which the G-action from the above theorem is smooth can be described as follows. By Theorem 5.6 of [\cite=wiemeler_pre4] the T-equivariant smooth structures on M correspond one-to-one to smooth structures on the orbit space M / T. The G-action is smooth for the T-equivariant smooth structure on M for which M / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope.

In this paper all actions of compact Lie-groups on manifolds M are smooth with respect to some smooth structure on M.

This article is organized as follows. In section [\ref=sec:pairs] we review some basic facts about quasitoric manifolds and introduce an automorphism group for the characteristic pair corresponding to a quasitoric manifold. In section [\ref=sec:construct] we construct the group G from Theorem [\ref=sec:introduction]. In section [\ref=sec:class] we review the classification of quasitoric manifolds with G-action up to G-equivariant diffeomorphism given in [\cite=torus]. Moreover, we give a classification of these manifolds up to G-equivariant homeomorphism. In section [\ref=sec:unique] we apply the results of the previous section and show that the group G has the properties described in Theorem [\ref=sec:introduction].

Characteristic pairs and their automorphism groups

Let M be a 2n-dimensional quasitoric manifold, P its orbit polytope and π:M  →  P the orbit map. Denote by [formula] the set of facets of P. We write also [formula] instead of [formula] if it is clear from the context which quasitoric manifold is meant. Then the preimage Mi  =  π- 1(Fi) of [formula] is a codimension two submanifold of M which is fixed by a one dimensional subtorus λ(Fi) = λ(Mi) of T. These Mi are called characteristic submanifolds of M. Since the facets of P correspond one-to-one to the characteristic submanifolds of M, we denote the set of characteristic manifolds also by [formula].

Let IT  ⊂  LT be the integral lattice in the Lie algebra of T. The characteristic map [formula] lifts to a map [formula] such that, for a subset σ of [formula] with [formula], {λ̄(Fi);  Fi∈σ} is part of a basis of IT. Note that each λ̄(Mi) is unique up to sign. We call λ̄ a characteristic function for M.

Dual to P there is a simplicial complex K with vertex set [formula]. A subset [formula] is a simplex of K if and only if [formula].

Note that M is determined by the combinatorial type of P (or K) and λ̄ up to equivariant homeomorphism [\cite=0733.52006]. This construction motivates the following definition.

Let K be a simplicial complex of dimension n - 1 with vertex set [formula]. Moreover let T be an n-dimensional torus and [formula] a map such that for all simplices σ of K the set {λ̄(Fi);  Fi∈σ} is part of a basis of IT. Then we call (K,λ̄) a characteristic pair.

An omniorientation of a quasitoric manifold M is a choice of orientations for M and all characteristic submanifolds of M. An omniorientation of M induces a complex structure on all normal bundles of the characteristic submanifolds. These complex structures may be used to make the map λ̄ unique by requiring that the S1-action induced by λ̄(Mi) on the normal bundle of Mi is given by complex multiplication.

The cohomology [formula] was computed by Davis and Januszkiewicz [\cite=0733.52006]. It is torsion-free and generated by the Poincaré-duals PD(Mi) of the characteristic manifolds. If we choose λ̄ as above, then these Poincaré-duals are subject to the following relations

[formula]

and, for [formula],

If σ is a simplex of K, then, because {λ̄(Fi);  Fi∈σ} is part of a basis of IT, we may choose an isomorphism [formula], such that the λ̄(Fi)'s are given by the columns of a matrix of the form where the first #  σ columns of Λ correspond to the Fi∈σ. We call such a matrix a characteristic matrix of M. If [formula] is the basis of IT* dual to the standard basis of [formula], then the coefficient 〈vj,λ̄(Mi)〉 in equation ([\ref=eq:1]) is the i-th entry of the jth row of Λ. Hence, one can read off all relations in ([\ref=eq:1]) from the matrix Λ.

We are interested in the symmetries of M. Since quasitoric manifolds are determined by their characteristic pairs, we should also study automorphisms of charcateristic pairs. Therefore we define:

Let (K,λ̄) be a characteristic pair. Then we define the automorphism group of (K,λ̄) to be

Let M be a quasitoric manifold. Choose an omniorientation on M such that for two characteristic submanifolds M1,M2  ⊂  M we have For α∈H2(M) let Then there is a unique homomorphism [formula] such that [formula] is the standard inclusion. Here, [formula] is the natural projection.

Let [formula]. If (f,g) is an element of [formula] such that ψ((f,g)) = σ, then we must have f = σ and Lg(λ̄(Fi)) = λ̄(σ(Fi)) for all [formula]. Since IT is generated by the λ̄(Fi), [formula], g is uniquely determined by σ. Therefore a homomorphism [formula] with the properties described in the lemma is unique, if it exists.

Now we show that φ exists. Let [formula]. Then we have, for [formula], Therefore σ is an automorphism of K.

Now let [formula] such that [formula]. Then [formula] is a basis of IT. Moreover, since σ is an automorphism of K, the same holds for [formula].

Therefore we may define an autormorphism gσ of T by Lgσ(λ̄(Fi)) = λ̄(σ(Fi)) for [formula]. Let [formula] be the basis of IT* dual to [formula] and [formula] the basis of IT* dual to [formula]. Then we have, for [formula],

[formula]

Since [formula] is a basis of H2(M), it follows that Lgσ(λ̄(Mi)) = λ̄(σ(Mi)) for all [formula].

Therefore [formula] and we define φ(σ) = (σ,gσ).

Let M be a quasitoric manifold as in Lemma [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their]. Then for x∈MT and α∈H2(M) we have

It follows from the relations ([\ref=eq:1]) that the Poincaré duals of the [formula], [formula], form a basis of H2(M).

Constructing group actions

In this section we construct an action of a compact connected Lie-group on a quasitoric manifold which extends the torus action.

Before we do that we explain how an action of a compact connected Lie-group on a quasitoric manifold M induces a homomorphism of the Weyl-group [formula]. Here and in the following we choose an omniorientation of M as in Lemma [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their].

Assume that there is a compact connected Lie-group G such that a finite quotient of G acts on M by an extension of the T-action. Then M is called a quasitoric manifold with G-action.

By Lemma 2.8 of [\cite=torus], G has a covering group of the form [formula]. Moreover, if g∈NGT and [formula], then gMi is a characteristic submanifold of M.

Therefore we get an action of W(G) on [formula]. Since G is connected, this action identifies W(G) with a subgroup of [formula]. There are disjoint subsets [formula] of [formula] such that W(SU(li + 1)) is identified with [formula] for [formula] [\cite=torus]. We call [formula] the set of characteristic submanifolds of M which are permuted by W(SU(li + 1)).

Moreover, W(G) acts on T by conjugation. The actions of W(G) on T and [formula] induce an action of W(G) on the characteristic pair (K,λ̄). The homomorphism [formula] corresponding to this action is the restriction of the homomorphism φ constructed in Lemma [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their] to W(G).

Now we state the main theorem of this section.

Let M be a quasitoric manifold as in Lemma [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their]. Then there is a smooth structure and a smooth action of a compact connected Lie-group G on M which extends the torus action such that [formula].

We prove this theorem by induction on the dimension of M. If dim M = 0 or [formula] for all α∈H2(M), then there is nothing to prove. Therefore assume that there is an α∈H2(M) such that [formula].

By Lemmas [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their] and [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their-1], there are two cases:

[formula] and, for all [formula], [formula],

[formula].

We consider at first the case ([\ref=item:1]). In this case we have with [formula] that

[formula] and

where Λ(M) and Λ(N) are the characteristic matrices of M and N, respectively. Here the first columns correspond to the facets in [formula]. They are of the form F  ×  N / T, where F runs through the facets of [formula].

We show at first ([\ref=item:3]). If this is shown then ([\ref=item:4]) follows immediately from ([\ref=eq:1]). Let [formula], then by Lemmas [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their] and [\ref=sec:char-pairs-their-1] we must have [formula]. Therefore we have a bijection [formula]. Because, by the same lemmas, the intersection of [formula] is empty if and only if [formula], ([\ref=item:3]) follows.

Therefore, by Proposition 1.8 of [\cite=0733.52006], M is equivariantly homeomorphic to Here the action of S1 on N is induced by the homomorphism φ:S1  →  T' to the torus, which acts on N, defined by [formula]. Moreover, S1 acts on [formula] by multiplication.

By the induction hypothesis there is a compact connected Lie-group G' which acts on N by an extension of the torus action, such that G' realizes the action of [formula] on the simplicial complex dual to N / T.

Then the action of [formula] on [formula] induces an action of [formula] on M such that the action of G / H extends the torus action. Here ZG'(φ(S1)) is the centralizer of φ(S1) in G' and H is the ineffective kernel of the G-action on M.

From Lemma 2.5 of [\cite=torus] we know that [formula]. Therefore we have to show that It follows from the remarks at the beginning of this section that W(ZG'(φ(S1))) is a subgroup of [formula]. Therefore let [formula]. Since [formula] is generated by transpositions, we may assume that w is a transposition.

Let [formula] such that [formula] is a single point. Then [formula] form a basis of IT'. Let [formula] be the dual basis of IT'*. Let [formula]. At first assume that w(Mi) = Mi' with [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Here the sums are taken over those characteristic submanifolds of M which do not belong to [formula]. Their Poincaré duals together with α form a basis of H2(M). Therefore we have

Now assume that [formula]. Then, because PD(Mi) = PD(w(Mi)) we must have 〈vi,λ̄(Mj)〉 = 0 for all [formula]. This implies 〈vi,μ〉 = 0. Moreover, we have

[formula]

Therefore we have μ = w*μ. This implies w∈W(ZG'(φ(S1))). Hence, the claim follows in this case.

Now assume that [formula] is non-empty. Then let [formula] be the blow-up of M along [formula] (see Section 4 of [\cite=torus] for details). If we write the characteristic matrix of M in the form

[formula]

such that the first [formula] columns correspond to the [formula], then the characteristic matrix of [formula] is given by where the proper transforms of the characteristic submanifolds of M are ordered as in ([\ref=eq:2]), the last column corresponds to the exceptional submanifold and the first [formula] entries in this column are equal to - 1.

Hence two characteristic submanifolds of M have the same Poincaré-duals if and only if there proper transforms have the same Poincaré-duals. Moreover, the Poincaré-dual of the exceptional submanifold is distinct from the Poincaré-duals of the other characteristic submanifolds of [formula].

By the first case there is a G-action on [formula] which extends the torus action. Since the exceptional submanifold is fixed by φ(S1), we can G-equivariantly blow down [formula] along the exceptional manifold to get a G-action on M (see [\cite=torus] for details).

The group G constructed in Theorem [\ref=sec:constr-group-acti] has a covering group of the form [formula].

This follows from the results of Section 2 of [\cite=torus] and the description of the W(G)-action on [formula] given in Theorem [\ref=sec:constr-group-acti].

In [\cite=wiemeler_pre4] we proved that the equivariant smooth structures on a quasitoric manifold correspond one-to-one to the smooth structures on its orbit space. We will show that the G-action constructed in Theorem [\ref=sec:constr-group-acti] is smooth with respect to the smooth structure on M which corresponds to the natural smooth structure on the simple polytope P. This will follow from the proof of Theorem [\ref=sec:constr-group-acti], Corollary 5.3 of [\cite=wiemeler_pre4] and the following lemma.

In the situation of Theorem 5.16 of [\cite=torus] we have: N / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope if and only if M / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope.

If M / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope, then N / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope because N / T is a face of M / T.

So we only have to prove the other implication. If N / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope, then all face-preserving homeomorphisms constructed in the proof of the cited theorem may be replaced by diffeomorphisms. So if we follow the proof of this theorem we end-up with a diffeomorphism which we want to extend to a diffeomorphism F1  ×  Δl1 + 1  →  F1  ×  Δl1 + 1. That this is possible follows from Theorem 5.1 of [\cite=wiemeler_pre4] because every facet of F1  ×  Δl1 of the form F1  ×  F, where F is a facet of Δl1, is mapped my g to a facet of the same form.

The action of the group G constructed in Theorem [\ref=sec:constr-group-acti] is smooth with respect to the smooth structure on M corresponding to the natural smooth structure on P.

We use the same induction and notations as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=sec:constr-group-acti]. If the G'-action on N is smooth with respect to the smooth structure on N for which N / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope, then by Lemma [\ref=sec:smooth-struct-polyt-2] the G-action on M is smooth with respect to the smooth structure for which M / T is diffeomorphic to a simple polytope. Since two simple polytopes are combinatorially equivalent if and only if they are diffeomorphic [\cite=wiemeler_pre4], it follows that the G-action on M is smooth with respect to the smooth structure for which M / T is diffeomorphic to P.

Classification

Let G be a compact Lie-group with maximal torus T. A quasitoric manifold with G-action is a smooth G-manifold M such that M together with the action of the maximal torus of G / H is a quasitoric manifold. Here H is a finite subgroup of G which acts trivially on M. In [\cite=torus] we classified quasitoric manifolds with G-action. As a first step towards this classification we showed that G has a covering group of the form [formula].

The classification was given in terms of admissible triples [formula], where

ψ is an homomorphism [formula].

N is a 2n-dimensional quasitoric manifold.

The Ai are characteristic submanifolds of N or empty. If Ai is non-empty then [formula] acts trivially on Ai and ker ψ|S(U(li)  ×  U(1)) = SU(li).

Two such triples [formula] and [formula] are called equivalent or diffeomorphic if

ψ|S(U(li)  ×  U(1))  =  ψ'|S(U(li)  ×  U(1)) if li > 1.

ψ|S(U(li)  ×  U(1))  =  ψ'±  1|S(U(li)  ×  U(1)) if li = 1.

There is an Tl0-equivariant diffeomorphism f:N  →  N' such that f(Ai) = A'i for all i.

The main theorem of [\cite=torus] may be formulated in the following way:

Let [formula]. Then the G-equivariant diffeomorphism classes of quasitoric manifolds with G-action are in one-to-one correspondence with the diffeomorphism classes of admissible triples.

We call two admissible triples [formula] and [formula] homeomorphic if

ψ|S(U(li)  ×  U(1))  =  ψ'|S(U(li)  ×  U(1)) if li > 1.

ψ|S(U(li)  ×  U(1))  =  ψ'±  1|S(U(li)  ×  U(1)) if li = 1.

There is a Tl0-equivariant homeomorphism f:N  →  N' such that f(Ai) = A'i for all i.

With this notation we have the following classification of quasitoric manifolds with G-action up to G-equivariant homeomorphism.

Let [formula]. Then the G-equivariant homeomorphism classes of quasitoric manifolds with G-action are in one-to-one correspondence with the homeomorphism classes of admissible triples.

At first note that the homeomorphism type of the admissible triple corresponding to a quasitoric manifold with G-action depends only on the G-equivariant homeomorphism type of M because N and the Ai may be identified with intersections of characteristic submanifolds of M and ψ depends only on the isotropy groups of points in these intersections (see Sections 5 and 8 of [\cite=torus] for details).

Because by the proof of Corollary 8.8 of [\cite=torus] M / G = N / Tl0, it follows from Lemma [\ref=sec:classification-2] below that the homeomorphism type of the admissible triple determines the G-equivariant homeomorphism type of M.

Let M be a quasitoric manifold with G-action, [formula]. Then M is equivariantly homeomorphic to M / G  ×  G /   ~  , where (x,g)  ~  (x',g') if and only if x = x' and gg'- 1∈Hx. Here the groups Hx depend only on x and the admissible triple corresponding to M.

We prove this lemma by induction on the number of simple factors of G. If G is a torus then this lemma is due to Davis and Januszkiewicz [\cite=0733.52006].

Therefore we may assume that there is at least one simple factor. There are two cases:

[formula]

[formula].

In the first case we have by Corollary 5.6 of [\cite=torus] where M' is a quasitoric manifold with G'-action, [formula]. The action of S(U(l1)  ×  U(1)) on N is induced by the homomorphism where ψ is the homomorphism from the admissible triple of M. Moreover, by the proof of Corollary 8.8 of [\cite=torus], we have M / G = M' / G'. Therefore by the induction hypothesis we have For a subgroup H'x of G' we have Therefore the statement follows in this case with [formula].

If MSU(l1 + 1) is non-empty. Then M is the blow-down of some quasitoric manifold [formula] with G-action but without SU(l1 + 1) fixed points. Let F:  →  M be the projection. Then we have M =   /    ~  '', where y  ~  ''y' if and only if there is a g∈SU(l1 + 1) such that gy = y' in the case y,y'∈F- 1(MSU(l1 + 1)) or y = y' otherwise.

Since under the identification of M / G with N / Tl0 given in the proof of Corollary 8.8 of [\cite=torus] MSU(l1 + 1) / G is identified with A1 / Tl0. for x∈MSU(l1 + 1) / G, we have [formula].

Therefore we have [formula] if x∈MSU(l1 + 1) / G. Hence the statement follows with

Let [formula] and M, M' be two quasitoric manifolds with G-action. Let T be a maximal torus of G. Then M and M' are G-equivariantly homeomorphic (diffeomorphic), if and only if they are T-equivariantly homeomorphic (diffeomorphic).

Without loss of generality we may assume that T is the standard maximal torus of G. Let [formula] be the admissible triple corresponding to M. We show that [formula] is determined up to homeomorphism (diffeomorphism) by the homeomorphism (diffeomorphism) type of the T-action on M.

At first, by Lemmas 2.7 and 2.10 of [\cite=torus], the characteristic submanifolds which are permuted by the Weyl-group W(SU(li + 1)) are exactly those characteristic manifolds Mj for which [formula] is non-trivial. Here πi:G  →  SU(li + 1) is the projection. Denote by [formula] the set of the characteristic submanifolds which are permuted by W(SU(li + 1)).

If li > 1, there is exactly one [formula] such that λ(Mji) is fixed by W(S(U(li)  ×  U(1))). Because for each [formula] we have [formula], Mji is the only characteristic submanifold such that [formula] is contained in the center of S(U(li)  ×  U(1)).

If li = 1, then [formula] has exactly two elements and any choose of a [formula] leads to the same equivalence class of admissible triples (see [\cite=torus] for details).

Then we have

[formula]

By its construction in the proof of Lemma 5.3 of [\cite=torus], the homomorphism ψ depends only on the [formula]-representation TxM with x∈NTl0. Since T is a maximal torus of [formula], this representation depends only on the T-equivariant homeomorphism type of M.

Now the statement follows from Theorem [\ref=sec:classification].

Uniqueness

In this section we prove that the group constructed in section [\ref=sec:construct] is a maximal compact connected Lie-subgroup of the homeomorphism group of M which contains the torus and that it is unique up to conjugation.

Let M be a quasitoric manifold with G-action, [formula] and T a maximal torus of G, such that Tl0 acts effectively on M. Denote by [formula], [formula], the set of characteristic submanifolds of M which are permuted by W(SU(li + 1)). Moreover, let [formula]. Then we have:

The subgroup of G which acts trivially on M is given by

Let M1 be a characteristic submanifold of M which belongs to [formula] and x∈M1 a generic point. Then Tx is connected and if i > 0. If i = 0 then Tx is connected and [formula].

At first we prove ([\ref=item:5]). We prove this statement by induction on k. If k = 0, then there is nothing to prove. Therefore assume that k > 0 and that the statement is proved for all quasitoric manifolds with [formula]-action. With the notation from the proof of Lemma [\ref=sec:classification-2] the subgroup of G which acts trivially on M is given by

[formula]

Here H' denote the subgroup of G' which acts trivially on N.

Now we prove the second statement. At first assume i > 0. After blowing up M along the fixed points of SU(li + 1), we may assume that Then there is an SU(li + 1)-equivariant projection [formula]. The characteristic submanifold M1 of M is given by a preimage of a characteristic submanifold [formula] of [formula]. Now we have where Tli denotes [formula]. Since Tlip(x) contains the center of SU(li + 1) the statement follows in this case.

If i = 0, then it follows from Lemma 2.10 of [\cite=torus] that Tx is contained in Tl0. Therefore the statement follows in this case.

Let M be a quasitoric manifold and T the torus which acts on M by [formula]. Let Gj, j = 1,2, be compact connected Lie-groups and ιj:T  →  G, j = 1,2, embeddings of T as maximal tori of Gj. Assume that there are effective actions [formula], j = 1,2, such that [formula] for j = 1,2. Moreover, assume that the natural actions of W(Gj), j = 1,2, on [formula] induce identifications of W(G1) and W(G2) with a given subgroup H of [formula]. Then φ1(G1) and φ2(G2) are conjugated in [formula].

Since the Weyl-groups of G1 and G2 are isomorphic. There is a group of the form [formula] and coverings φj:  →  Gj, j = 1,2.

Because all maximal tori in [formula] are conjugated, we may assume that there is a maximal torus T̃ of [formula] such that T̃  =  φ- 1j(ιj(T)), j = 1,2. Let ψ be the automorphism of LT̃ given by [formula].

Choose an omniorientation for M such that, for all characteristic submanifolds Mi, Mj of M, we have: This omniorientation is preserved by the actions of G1 and G2. Denote by λ̄ the characteristic function for the T-action on M. Moreover, denote by λ̄j(Mi), j = 1,2, [formula], a primitive vector in IT̃ which generates the isotropy group of a generic point in Mi with respect to the T̃-action [formula]. We choose this primitive vector in such a way that it is compatible with the omniorientation chosen above.

Then by Lemma [\ref=sec:uniqueness-1] we have, for all [formula], i > 0, and j = 1,2, For [formula] we have

This implies that ψ(λ̄2(Mk)) = λ̄1(Mk). Therefore for w∈W() we have by Lemma 2.10 of [\cite=torus] It follows that ψ is an automorphism of the W()-representation LT̃. Because each irreducible non-trivial summand of LT̃ appears only once in a decomposition of LT̃ in irreducible representations, it follows from Schur's Lemma that the restriction of ψ to the Lie-algebra of the maximal torus T̃i of a simple factor SU(li + 1) of [formula] is multiplication with a constant [formula].

Therefore we have Denote this subtorus of T by Ti. By Lemma [\ref=sec:uniqueness-1], we have that Note that [formula] is a lattice of maximal rank in IT̃i. Then we have

[formula]

because ψ(Ii2) = Ii1. Therefore we must have ai  =    ±  1. Therefore there is an automorphism Ψ of [formula] with LΨ  =  ψ. Now the statement follows from Theorem [\ref=sec:classification-1] applied to the [formula]-actions [formula] and [formula].

If, in the situation of Lemma [\ref=sec:uniqueness], both Gj-actions are smooth with respect to the same smooth structure, then it follows from Theorem [\ref=sec:classification-1] that φ1(G1) and φ2(G2) are conjugated in [formula].

Let M be a quasitoric manifold and [formula], the group constructed in section [\ref=sec:construct]. If G' is an other compact connected Lie-group which acts by an extension of the torus action on M. Then G' is conjugated in [formula] to a subgroup of G. If the G and G'-actions are smooth for the same smooth structure on M, then G' is conjugated in [formula] to a subgroup of G.

Let [formula] be a partition in W(G')-orbits. Then we have [formula]. Moreover since the G'-action on H*(M) is trivial it follows that the sets [formula], α∈H2(M), are W(G')-invariant.

This gives as an homomorphism [formula]. There is a subgroup of maximal rank of G whose Weyl-group is given by the image of this homomorphism. Therefore the statement follows from Lemma [\ref=sec:uniqueness].

Now we have proven all parts of Theorem [\ref=sec:introduction] besides the statement about the symplectic toric manifolds. To prove this part we first recall the construction of a maximal compact Lie-subgroup of the symplectomorphism group of a symplectic toric manifold due to Masuda [\cite=1210.53081]. An alternative construction of this group was given by McDuff and Tolman [\cite=1202.52010].

He showed that there is a root system R(M) such that the root system of every compact connected Lie-subgroup of the symplectomorphism group which contains the torus is a subroot system of R(M). Moreover, he constructed a compact Lie-subgroup G' of the symplectomorphism group which contains the torus and has a root system isomorphic to R(M).

The proof of the first part of Masuda's results is also valid for any compact connected Lie-subgroup of the homeomorphism group of M which contains the torus and preserves the omniorientation induced by the symplectic form on M. Therefore G and G' are conjugated, if the G-action preserves this omniorientation.

Hence, it is sufficient to prove that if M1 and M2 are characteristic submanifolds of M with PD(M1) =   ±  PD(M2), then we have PD(M1) = PD(M2). We consider two cases [formula] and [formula]. We should note here that if M is a symplectic toric manifold then λ̄(Fi) is the outward normal vector of the facet Fi of P.

Let [formula] be the standard basis of [formula]. In the first case we may assume that [formula] and λ̄(F1) = e1, λ̄(Fi) = ei - 1 for [formula]. It follows from PD(M1) =   ±  PD(M2) that [formula] and [formula] for j > n + 1 with [formula]. Therefore [formula] is an interval with boundary [formula]. Hence we must have [formula]. This implies PD(M1) = PD(M2).

Now consider the case [formula].

Without loss of generality we may assume that [formula] and λ̄(Fi) = ei for [formula].

Assume that PD(M1) =  - PD(M2). Then for all [formula], j > n, there are [formula] such that Because the λ̄(Fj) are the outward normal vectors of the facets of P it follows that [formula] is non-compact. But this is impossible because P is a convex polytope. Therefore we must have PD(M1) = PD(M2).
