Warnaar's bijection and colored partition identities, II

Introduction

This paper is the second of a series of two, begun with [\cite=CSFZ1], in which we study colored partition identities. Our project is motivated by the recent paper [\cite=Be], where B. C. Berndt determined and proved analytically the colored partition identities corresponding to five exceptional modular equations of prime degree that he defined "of the Schröter, Russell and Ramanujan type", after the work of these three mathematicians (see [\cite=BR] [\cite=Ra] [\cite=Ru1] [\cite=Ru2] [\cite=Sc]). We refer to the introduction to [\cite=CSFZ1], and of course to [\cite=Be], for more details.

In [\cite=CSFZ1], responding to Berndt's call, we determined a general and unified combinatorial framework in which to look at a number of colored partition identities, including the five of the Schröter, Russell and Ramanujan type. In fact, extending S. Kim's idea from [\cite=Ki], in Theorem 2.3 in [\cite=CSFZ1] we proved that a large family of colored partition identities is equivalent to suitable equations in [formula], where the νi are partitions and the di are integers whose sum is odd. This allowed us to show bijectively two more identities of the Schröter, Russell and Ramanujan type (namely, those whose corresponding modular equations have degrees 5 and 11). Thus, also thanks to the work of Kim [\cite=Ki], who gave the first bijective proofs of the identities modulo 3 and 7 (this latter also known as the "Farkas-Kra identity" [\cite=FK]), now only the identity modulo 23 is open combinatorially.

In this paper, we focus specifically on the case t = 12 of the equivalent equations given by [\cite=CSFZ1], Theorem 2.3, and deduce bijective proofs for a number of new, highly nontrivial colored partition identities. We believe that even more interesting identities of the same type hold, and we provide a large sample of these at the end, as conjectures.

Preliminary results

We begin by stating the main general result of [\cite=CSFZ1], which will be the key to bijectively show a number of new and challenging partition identities in the next section. Its proof greatly generalized that of Kim [\cite=Ki], and used as a crucial ingredient a bijection of S. O. Warnaar from [\cite=Wa]. We state our theorem here in the particular case t = 12 and [formula], which will suffice for our purposes.

For the main definitions of partition theory, as well as three different introductions to this field, we refer the reader to [\cite=And] [\cite=AE] [\cite=Pak].

Consider the equation

[formula]

for given integers C  ≥  1, 0  ≤  Ai  ≤  C / 2 and 0  ≤  Bi  ≤  C / 2 for all i, and m  ≥  0. Let S be the set containing one copy of all positive integers congruent to ±  Ai modulo C for each i, and T the set containing one copy of all positive integers congruent to ±  Bi modulo C for each i. Let DS(N) (respectively, DT(N)) be the number of partitions of N into distinct elements of S (respectively, T), where we require such partitions to have an odd number of parts if no Ai (respectively, no Bi) is equal to zero. Set

[formula]

adopting the convention that |X| = 1 if [formula]. Also, let P be the set of all partitions into positive integers.

Then the following are equivalent:

For any N  ≥  N0  ≥  1, the number of tuples [formula] such that the left-hand side of ([\ref=t]) equals N, μi∈P and [formula] for all i, and [formula] is odd, is equal to the number of tuples [formula] such that the right-hand side of ([\ref=t]) equals N, αi∈P and [formula] for all i, and [formula] is odd;

For any N  ≥  N0  ≥  1,

[formula]

See [\cite=CSFZ1], Theorem 2.3.

The first of our preliminary lemmas was proved in [\cite=CSFZ1]. We recall its statement in the t = 12, [formula] case for completeness.

Fix arbitrary [formula], such that 0  ≤  Ai  ≤  C  /  2 and 0  ≤  Bi  ≤  C / 2, for all [formula]. Let SN be the set of all tuples of 12 partitions and 12 integers [formula] such that [formula] is odd and

[formula]

Similarly, let TN be the set of all tuples of 12 partitions and 12 integers [formula] such that [formula] is odd and

[formula]

where m is an integer chosen so that the smallest value of N for which [formula] is also the second smallest value of N for which [formula]. Define k to be the smallest value such that [formula]. Further, let UN be the union of the set of all tuples of 12 integers [formula] such that [formula] is odd and

[formula]

with |Sk| copies of the set of all tuples of 12 integers [formula] such that [formula] is odd and

[formula]

Finally, let VN be the union of the set of all tuples of 12 integers [formula] such that [formula] is odd and

[formula]

with |Sk| copies of the set of all tuples of 12 integers [formula] such that [formula] is even and

[formula]

Then |SN| = |TN| for all N > k if and only if |UN| = |VN| for all N.

See [\cite=CSFZ1], Lemma 3.8.

Fix arbitrary [formula] and [formula], such that 0  ≤  Ai  ≤  C  /  2, 0  ≤  Bi  ≤  C / 2, 0  ≤  A'i  ≤  C  /  2 and 0  ≤  B'i  ≤  C / 2, for all i. Define SN, TN, SN', TN', k and k' as in Lemma [\ref=lemma1], and let QN, RN, QN' and RN' be, respectively, the subsets of SN, TN, SN' and TN' in which the partitions are all equal to [formula]. Then, if |SN| = |TN| for all N > k, the following are equivalent:

For all N > k', |SN'| = |TN'|.

For all N,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma1], |SN'| = |TN'| for all N > k' if and only if |UN + k''| = |VN + k''| for all N. But by subtracting |Sk''| times |UN + k| = |VN + k| from |Sk| times |UN + k''| = |VN + k''|, and canceling out the elements of the form [formula], this is easily seen to be equivalent to

[formula]

for all N, which is obviously equivalent to (ii).

Fix [formula] such that Ai + B13 - i = C / 2 for all [formula], and set [formula]. Then, for any integers [formula], we have:

[formula]

This can easily be verified algebraically.

Notice that the previous lemma implies that we can, in a sense, view d-tuples and e-tuples as both being in the same set, namely

[formula]

Every tuple [formula] has a value of [formula], and will in some sense be considered "of negative type" if the di are half-integers, since it will come from the opposite side of the bijection as the tuples in which the di are integers.

Finally, the last preliminary lemma is the following:

Fix integers [formula] and [formula], such that [formula] and [formula] for each i, [formula], and the second-smallest possible values of the left-hand sides of the versions of equation (1) of Theorem [\ref=main] with the coefficients below are equal to the smallest possible values of their respective right-hand sides.

Then condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for [formula], [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

[formula]

if and only if condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for [formula], [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

[formula]

Using the terminology introduced in Lemma [\ref=lemma1], for the first equation we have [formula], and for the second equation,

[formula]

Unless [formula], the left-hand side of each equation takes on its smallest value only when a variable with the smallest coefficient is 1 and the rest are 0. If two or fewer of the Bi are 0 this still holds. Also, it is clearly impossible for exactly three of them to be 0. Finally, if they are all 0, then the Ai all equal C / 2 and it is easy to check that the two left-hand sides take on their smallest values for 2  ·  12 = 24 and 23 = 8 values of the variables, respectively.

In all of these cases, there are three times as many ways for the left-hand side of the first expression to take on its smallest value as there are for the left-hand side of the second one to.

Thus, it easily follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma2] that proving the statement is tantamount to proving that condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holds for the values of C, Ai, Bi, A'i, and B'i given above. Since |Sk| = 3|S'k'|, this is equivalent to the statement that 3|QN + k''| + |RN + k| = 3|RN + k''| + |QN + k|, so it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3], we can view all d-tuples and e-tuples as being in the set [formula] and all d'-tuples and e'-tuples as being in the set [formula] Note that while D and D' contain the same tuples, they have different value functions.

Furthermore, for arbitrary integers [formula], we have the identity

[formula]

Now, consider a map φ which sends an element [formula] to a tuple [formula] as follows:

[formula]

The image of the tuple [formula] has a value of

[formula]

just like the elements of D. Therefore, if we apply φ to one copy of D', and φ, combined with the map

[formula]

to the other two copies of D', then the union of D with the three copies of D' can be bijectively mapped into the following set:

[formula]

For any [formula], this element has a value of

[formula]

and it belongs on the left-hand side of the desired bijection if and only if the number of di that are half-integers is 0 or 8.

For any such element, let x = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4, y = d5 + d6 + d7 + d8, and z = d9 + d10 + d11 + d12. Then the map

[formula]

will always send an element of W to an element of W with the same value. Clearly, it is also an involution. Furthermore, [formula] is odd, so either one or three quadruples of elements are being changed from an integer to a half-integer or vice-versa. Therefore, this map always converts an element to an element of the opposite type, and is the desired bijection.

The new colored partition identities

The goal of the rest of the paper is to show bijectively a number of new interesting partition identities, thanks to their equivalent formulation provided by Theorem [\ref=main]. Like the two identities of the Schröter, Russell and Ramanujan type that we proved in [\cite=CSFZ1], most of these identities will turn out to have highly nontrivial proofs.

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0  =  3, C = 2, m = 3, and

[formula]

We proceed in a similar way to the proof of [\cite=CSFZ1], Lemma 3.10 (the equation equivalent to the partition identity of the Schröter, Russell and Ramanujan type corresponding to the modular equation of degree 5). By Lemma [\ref=lemma1], one can easily check that the statement is equivalent to the existence of a bijection between the set of tuples [formula] and 24 copies of every tuple with odd sum [formula], and the set of tuples [formula] and 24 copies of every tuple with even sum [formula], such that, for every corresponding pair,

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3], we can consider the d-tuples and e-tuples as both being in the set [formula]. An arbitrary element of D, [formula], has a value of [formula]

Now, let

[formula]

Notice that these vectors are pairwise orthogonal. Also, for arbitrary d∈D and 1  ≤  i  ≤  12, d  ·  Vi is an odd integer. Let

[formula]

Notice that [formula], for any i and d. If [formula], then [formula] is a half-integer, so ri(d) is an element of D that corresponds to an e-tuple if d corresponds to a d-tuple, and vice-versa. So, we can map every point in D that has a dot product with any of the Vi that is divisible by 3 to a point of the opposite type and the same value by sending it to ri(d), where i is the smallest integer such that [formula].

Note that ri(d)  ·  Vj = d  ·  Vj for all j  ≠  i because of the orthogonality of the vectors, and ri(d)  ·  Vi =  - d  ·  Vi. It is easy to check that ri(ri(d)) = d. Therefore, this map is an involution.

That just leaves the points in D whose dot products with Vi are not divisible by 3 for any i. Let d∈D be any such point. For each i, let xi be the nearest integer to [formula], yi = d  ·  Vi - 6xi, and [formula]. For any i, [formula], so yi  =    ±  1.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have

[formula]

Now, z must be either a tuple of integers or a tuple of half-integers, and [formula] for each i. It is easy to check that the only tuples that fit these criteria are the 24 in which one element equals [formula] and the rest are 0. Therefore, we can choose a bijection between the 24 possible values of z and the 24 copies of each tuple [formula], and then map d to the copy of [formula] corresponding to z. It follows that

[formula]

Also, the yi are determined by z, and for any given choice of z, the only d that maps to a given tuple [formula] is [formula]. Furthermore, the entries of this d are all half-integers if [formula] is odd and integers if it is even. So, this map always takes elements of D corresponding to tuples of d's to tuples of f's with an even sum, and elements of D corresponding to tuples of e's to tuples of f's with an odd sum, as desired.

Let S be the set containing 24 copies of the odd positive integers, and T the set containing 24 copies of the even positive integers. Then, for any N  ≥  3,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=1].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0  =  1, C = 2, m = 1, and

[formula]

Straightforward from Lemmas [\ref=1] and [\ref=lemma4].

Let S be the set containing 8 copies of the even positive integers and 16 copies of the odd positive integers, and T the set containing 16 copies of the even positive integers and 8 copies of the odd positive integers. Then, for any N  ≥  1,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=2].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 4, C = 6, m = 3, and

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=1] and [\ref=lemma2], this statement is equivalent to condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holding for

[formula]

One can see that m' = 9, and |S'k'| = 2|Sk| = 24. So, this is equivalent to the statement that |QN + k''| + 2|RN + k| = |RN + k''| + 2|QN + k|. Thus, it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3], we can consider all d-tuples and e-tuples as being in the set [formula] and all d'-tuples and e'-tuples as being in the set [formula]. Note that D and D' are not really the same because they have different value functions. For arbitrary d∈D, there are three cases.

If [formula], we map d to another element of D with an equal value but the opposite type, using the map [formula], for each i. This map always results in [formula] such that [formula] and it is an involution, so it cancels out all such d.

If [formula], we map d to another element of D with an equal value but the opposite type, using the map [formula], for each i. This map always results in [formula] such that [formula], and it is an involution, so it cancels out all such d.

Finally, if [formula], we map both copies of d to elements of D' with the same value and type, using the maps [formula] and [formula], for all i. These maps are injective, and always result in d' such that [formula] and [formula], respectively. Therefore, they are bijections from the subset of D for which [formula] to the subsets of D' for which [formula].

That just leaves the subset of D' for which [formula]. We map any d' in this subset to another element of the subset with the same value but the opposite type, using the map [formula]. This map is an involution, thus it cancels out all d' in this subset. This completes the bijection and the proof of the lemma.

Let S be the set containing 12 copies of the even positive integers that are not multiples of 3, and T the set containing 12 copies of the odd positive integers that are not multiples of 3. Then, for any N  ≥  4,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=3].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 3, C = 6, m = 3, and

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=3] and [\ref=lemma2], this statement is equivalent to condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holding for

[formula]

One can see that m' = 3 and |S'k'| = 2|Sk| = 12, so this is equivalent to the statement that |QN + k''| + 2|RN + k| = |RN + k''| + 2|QN + k|. Thus, it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.”

By Lemma [\ref=lemma3], we can consider all d-tuples and e-tuples as being in the set [formula], and all d'-tuples and e'-tuples as being in the set [formula]. For arbitrary d∈D, let

[formula]

If [formula], we map d to another element of D with an equal value but the opposite type, using the map

[formula]

This map always results in [formula] such that [formula], and it is an involution, so it cancels out all such d.

If [formula], we map d to another element of D with an equal value but the opposite type, using the map

[formula]

This map always results in [formula] such that [formula], and it is an involution, so it cancels out all such d.

Finally, if [formula], we map both copies of d to elements of D' with the same value and type, using the two maps:

[formula]

and

[formula]

These maps are involutions (provided one modifies the second one by replacing x - 1 with x + 1 every time it occurs), and always result in d' such that [formula] and [formula], respectively. Hence, they are bijections from the subset of D for which [formula] to the subsets of D' for which [formula].

That just leaves the subset of D' for which [formula]. We map any d' in this subset to another element of the subset with the same value but the opposite type, using the map

[formula]

This map is an involution, so it cancels out all d' in this subset. This completes the bijection.

Let S be the set containing 6 copies of the odd positive integers and 6 more copies of the odd positive multiples of 3, and T the set containing 6 copies of the even positive integers and 6 more copies of the positive multiples of 6. Then, for any N  ≥  3,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=4].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 2, C = 4, m = 2, and

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=2] and [\ref=lemma2], and a renumbering of the variables, this statement is equivalent to condition (ii) of [\ref=lemma2] holding for C = 4,

[formula]

[formula]

Note that m' = 2, and |S'k'| = |Sk| = 8. So, this is equivalent to the statement that |QN + k''| + |RN + k| = |RN + k''| + |QN + k|. Thus, it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.

It is easy to check that the following map is a value-preserving bijection between d-tuples such that x = d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 is odd, and e-tuples such that e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 is odd:

[formula]

Furthermore, the same map is also a value-preserving bijection between d'-tuples such that x = d1' + d2' + d3' + d4' is odd, and e'-tuples such that e1' + e2' + e3' + e4' is odd.

Given any d-tuple such that d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 is not odd,

[formula]

must be odd. If [formula], we can map this tuple to a d'-tuple with the same value, using the map

[formula]

This map is a value-preserving bijection between the set of d-tuples for which [formula] and the set of d'-tuples for which [formula].

If [formula], we can map this tuple to a d'-tuple with the same value, using the map

[formula]

This map is a value-preserving bijection between the set of d-tuples for which [formula] and the set of d'-tuples for which [formula]. So, together they form a value-preserving bijection between the set of d-tuples for which d5 + d6 + d7 + d8 + d9 + d10 + d11 + d12 is odd and the set of d'-tuples for which d5' + d6' + d7' + d8' + d9' + d10' + d11' + d12' is odd.

Furthermore, the exact same pair of maps forms a value-preserving bijection between the set of all e-tuples for which e5 + e6 + e7 + e8 + e9 + e10 + e11 + e12 is odd and the set of e'-tuples for which e5' + e6' + e7' + e8' + e9' + e10' + e11' + e12' is odd.

These partial bijections combine to give the desired bijection.

Let S be the set containing 8 copies of the positive integers that are not multiples of 4, and T the set containing 8 copies of the positive integers that are not congruent to 2 modulo 4. Then, for any N  ≥  2,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=5].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 1, C = 4, m = 1, and

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=2] and [\ref=lemma2], this statement is equivalent to condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holding for

[formula]

Note that m' = 2, and |S'k'| = 2|Sk| = 8. So, this is equivalent to the statement that |QN + k''| + 2|RN + k| = |RN + k''| + 2|QN + k|. Thus, it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.

Note that [formula], d1'' = 1 - d1', [formula], and e1'' = 1 - e1' are value-preserving bijections from the sets of all d-, d'-, e-, and e'-tuples with an odd sum, to the sets of all d-, d'-, e-, and e'-tuples with an even sum, respectively. So, the requirement that the tuples have an odd sum is irrelevant here and we can ignore it.

Also, the coefficients of the first 3 elements of each type of tuple are the same, and the coefficients of the last 3 elements of each type of tuple are also the same. Thus, we can extend to the desired bijection any value-preserving bijection between the set containing 2 copies of each tuple [formula] and a copy of each tuple [formula], and the set containing 2 copies of each tuple [formula] and a copy of each tuple [formula], by having all maps leave the first three and last three elements of all tuples unchanged.

Now, let [formula], and for each x∈X, assign x a value of

[formula]

The map

[formula]

[formula]

is a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of tuples [formula] for which d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 is odd, and X. Similarly, the map

[formula]

[formula]

is a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of tuples [formula] for which e6 + e7 + e8 + e9 is even, and X. Obviously, combining the two yields a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of tuples [formula] for which d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 is odd and the set of all copies of tuples [formula] for which e6 + e7 + e8 + e9 is even.

Also, the map

[formula]

[formula]

is a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of tuples [formula] for which d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 is even and the set of all tuples [formula]. Similarly, the map

[formula]

[formula]

is a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of tuples [formula] for which e6 + e7 + e8 + e9 is odd and the set of tuples [formula].

Combining these bijections and then extending them to [formula] yields the desired bijection.

Let S be the set containing 4 copies of the odd positive integers, 6 copies of the positive multiples of 4, and 10 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4; let T the set containing 4 copies of the odd positive integers, 10 copies of the positive multiples of 4, and 6 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4. Then, for any N  ≥  1,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=6].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 1, C = 4, m = 1, and

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=6] and [\ref=lemma2], this statement is equivalent to condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holding for

[formula]

Note that m' = 1, and |S'k'| = 2|Sk| = 4. So, this is equivalent to the statement that |QN + k''| + 2|RN + k| = |RN + k''| + 2|QN + k|. Thus, it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.

Obviously, the identity map is a value-preserving bijection between the set of e'-tuples and the set containing one copy of each e-tuple. The maps [formula], d1'' = 1 - d1', and [formula] are value-preserving bijections from the sets of all d-, d'-, and e-tuples with an odd sum, to the sets of all d-, d'-, and e-tuples with an even sum, respectively. So, the requirement that the tuples have an odd sum is irrelevant and we can ignore it.

The following is a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of d-tuples such that d3 + d4 + d5 + d10 is odd, and the set containing the other copy of each e-tuple:

[formula]

Similarly, the following map is a value-preserving bijection between the set of all copies of d-tuples such that d3 + d4 + d5 + d10 is even and the set of all d'-tuples:

[formula]

Combining these maps yields the desired bijection.

Let S be the set containing 8 copies of the odd positive integers and 4 copies of the even positive integers, and T the set containing 4 copies of the odd positive integers, 10 copies of the positive multiples of 4, and 6 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4. Then, for any N  ≥  1,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=7].

Combining the last two partition identities, we immediately have:

Let S be the set containing 8 copies of the odd positive integers and 4 copies of the even positive integers, and T the set containing 4 copies of the odd positive integers, 6 copies of the positive multiples of 4, and 10 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to 2 modulo 4. Then, for any N  ≥  1,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorems [\ref=666] and [\ref=777].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 1, C = 6, m = 1, and

[formula]

Straightforward from Lemmas [\ref=4] and [\ref=lemma4].

Let S be the set containing 4 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to either 0 or ±  1 modulo 6, 2 copies of the even positive integers that are not multiples of 3, and 8 copies of the odd positive multiples of 3; let T be the set containing 4 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to either 3 or ±  2 modulo 6, 2 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to ±  1 modulo 6, and 8 copies of the positive multiples of 6. Then, for any N  ≥  1,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=8].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 2, C = 6, m = 1, and

[formula]

Straightforward from Lemmas [\ref=3] and [\ref=lemma4].

Let S be the set containing 4 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to ±  1 modulo 6, and 8 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to ±  2 modulo 6; let T be the set containing 8 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to ±  1 modulo 6, and 4 copies of the positive integers that are congruent to ±  2 modulo 6. Then, for any N  ≥  2,

[formula]

Straightforward from Theorem [\ref=main] and Lemma [\ref=9].

Condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=main] holds for N0 = 4, C = 10, m = 3, and

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=4] and [\ref=lemma2], this statement is equivalent to condition (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma2] holding for C = 30,

[formula]

[formula]

Note that m = 9, m' = 15, and |S'k'| = |Sk| = 6. So, this is equivalent to the statement that |QN + k''| + |RN + k| = |RN + k''| + |QN + k|. Thus, it suffices to show that for each [formula] or [formula] there is a corresponding [formula] or [formula] and vice-versa.

For an arbitrary d-tuple, let wi = di + di + 6 for each i. Clearly, [formula] is odd, so either 1, 3, or 5 of them are odd. If wi1, wi2, and wi3 are odd and wj1, wj2, and wj3 are even, then the map

[formula]

[formula]

for x∈{1,2,3}, yields an e-tuple of equal value. This map gives a bijection between the set of d-tuples for which three of the w's are odd, and the set of e-tuples for which three of the ei + ei + 6 are odd. That leaves the cases where one or all but one of them are odd.

There is an obvious value-preserving bijection from the set of d-tuples for which wi has the opposite parity as the rest, to the set of d-tuples for which w1 has the opposite parity as the rest, and there is an obvious bijection from the set of e-tuples for which ei + ei + 6 has the opposite parity as the rest, to the set of e-tuples for which e1 + e7 has the opposite parity as the rest, for each i. So, we can focus on the cases where the first one has a different parity than all of the others.

If w1 is odd and the rest are even, then there exist integers [formula] for which (d1,d7) = (1,0) - f1(1,1) + f2( - 1,1), and (di,di + 6) = (0,0) + f2i - 1(1,1) + f2i(1, - 1), for each 2  ≤  i  ≤  6. If each f-tuple is considered to have a value of

[formula]

then it is easy to check that this map is a value-preserving bijection. If w1 is even and the rest are odd, then there exist integers [formula] for which (d1,d7) = (0,0) + g1(1,1) + g2(1, - 1), and (di,di + 6) = (1,0) - g2i - 1(1,1) + g2i( - 1,1), for each 2  ≤  i  ≤  6. If each g-tuple is considered to have a value of

[formula]

then this map is a value-preserving bijection.

If e1 + e7 is odd and the rest are even, there exist integers [formula] for which (e1,e7) = (1,0) - h1(1,1) + h2( - 1,1), and (ei,ei + 6) = (0,0) + h2i - 1(1,1) + h2i(1, - 1), for each 2  ≤  i  ≤  6. If each h-tuple is considered to have a value of

[formula]

then this map is a value-preserving bijection. If e1 + e7 is even and the rest are odd, there exist integers [formula] for which (e1,e7) = (0,0) + k1(1,1) + k2(1, - 1), and (ei,ei + 6) = (1,0) - k2i - 1(1,1) + k2i( - 1,1), for each 2  ≤  i  ≤  6.

If each k-tuple is considered to have a value of

[formula]

this map is a value-preserving bijection.

So, tuples of these types have values of:

[formula]

Now, let S be the set of all tuples (s1,s2,s3,s4), and let an arbitrary element of S have a value of

[formula]

Also let Q be the set of all tuples (q1,q2,q3,q4) or (q5,q6,q7,q8), and let an arbitrary element of Q have a value of

[formula]

Further, regard the second group of tuples as being of the opposite type as the first. Then let R be the set of all tuples (r1,r2,r3,r4) or (r5,r6,r7,r8), and let an arbitrary element of R have a value of

[formula]

Again, regard the second group of tuples as being of the opposite type as the first. Finally, let T be the set of all ordered triples of an element of Q, an element of R, and an element of S, and let each element of T have a value equal to the sum of its elements' values. An element of T should be considered to be of one type if its elements of Q and R are both of their first types or both of their second types, and of the opposite type if one of them is of its first type and the other is of its second type.

There is an obvious bijection from the union of the sets of f-, g-, h-, and k-tuples to T that preserves both value and type. So, there is a bijection from the set of all d- and e-tuples that we have not already canceled out to 6 copies of T that preserves value and type.

Similarly, for an arbitrary d'-tuple, let w'i = d'i + d'i + 6, for each i. The same maps we used before form a value-preserving bijection between the set of all d'-tuples such that exactly 3 of the wi' are odd and the set of all e'-tuples such that exactly 3 of the e'i + e'i + 6 are odd. With those cases eliminated, we can focus on the case where w1' or e1' + e7' is the one having the opposite parity as the others, for the same reasons as before.

For each i, define fi',gi',hi',ki' analogously to the way we defined fi,gi,hi,ki. The map (d1',d7') = (1,0) - f1'(1,1) + f2'( - 1,1), (di',di + 6') = (0,0) + f2i - 1'(1,1) + f2i'(1, - 1) is a value-preserving bijection if [formula] is considered to have a value of

[formula]

The map (d1',d7') = (0,0) + g1'(1,1) + g2'(1, - 1), (di',di + 6') = (1,0) - g2i - 1'(1,1) + g2i'( - 1,1) is a value-preserving bijection if [formula] is considered to have a value of

[formula]

The map (e1',e7') = (1,0) - h1'(1,1) + h2'( - 1,1), (ei',ei + 6') = (0,0) + h2i - 1'(1,1) + h2i'(1, - 1) is a value-preserving bijection if [formula] is considered to have a value of

[formula]

Finally, the map (e1',e7') = (0,0) + k1'(1,1) + k2'(1, - 1), (ei',ei + 6') = (1,0) - k2i - 1'(1,1) + k2i'( - 1,1) is a value-preserving bijection if [formula] is considered to have a value of

[formula]

Now, let S' be the set of all tuples (s1',s2',s3',s4'), and let an arbitrary element of S' have a value of

[formula]

Also let Q' be the set of all tuples (q1',q2',q3',q4') or (q5',q6',q7',q8'), and let an arbitrary element of Q' have a value of

[formula]

Regard the second group of tuples as being of the opposite type as the first. Then let R' be the set of all tuples (r1',r2',r3',r4') or (r5',r6',r7',r8'), and let an arbitrary element of R' have a value of

[formula]

Again, regard the second group of tuples as being of the opposite type as the first. Finally, let T' be the set of all ordered triples of an element of Q', an element of R' and an element of S', and let each element of T' have a value equal to the sum of its elements' values. An element of T' should be considered to be of one type if its elements of Q' and R' are both of their first types or both of their second types, and of the opposite type if one of them is of its first type and the other is of its second type.

There is an obvious bijection from the union of the sets of f'-, g'-, h'- and k'-tuples to T' that preserves both value and type. So, there exists a bijection from the set of all d'- and e'-tuples that we have not already canceled out to 6 copies of T', which preserves value and type. Therefore, in order to show the lemma it now suffices to prove that there is a value-preserving bijection from the set of elements of [formula] of one type, to the set of elements of [formula] of the opposite type.

Now, consider the following map in Q: [formula]

This map is a value-preserving bijection from the set of tuples (q5,q6,q7,q8) with odd sums to the set of tuples (q1,q2,q3,q4) with odd sums. Furthermore, it maps all tuples (q5,q6,q7,q8) with even sums to tuples of half-integers (q1,q2,q3,q4) with even sums and equal values. At this point, the map

[formula]

is a value-preserving bijection from the set of tuples (q1,q2,q3,q4) that results from the last map to the set of tuples (a1,a2,a3,a4), if (a1,a2,a3,a4) is considered to have a value of

[formula]

It also preserves the type if these tuples are considered to have a type based on the parity of [formula].

The same pair of maps cancels all tuples in R with odd sums and maps the rest to tuples (b1,b2,b3,b4) with the same value and type, if (b1,b2,b3,b4) is considered to have a value of

[formula]

and a type dependent on the parity of [formula].

They also cancel all tuples in Q' with odd sums and map the rest to tuples (a1',a2',a3',a4') with the same value and type, if (a1',a2',a3',a4') is considered to have a value of

[formula]

and a type dependent on the parity of [formula].

Finally, they cancel all tuples in R' with odd sums and map the rest to tuples (b1',b2',b3',b4') with the same value and type, if (b1',b2',b3',b4') is considered to have a value of

[formula]

and a type dependent on the parity of [formula].

Therefore, to prove the result it suffices to find a bijection from the union of the set of all tuples (a1,a2,a3,a4,b1,b2,b3,b4,s1,s2,s3,s4) for which [formula] and the set of all tuples (a1',a2',a3',a4',b1',b2',b3',b4',s1',s2',s3',s4') for which [formula], to the union of the set of all tuples (a1,a2,a3,a4,b1,b2,b3,b4,s1,s2,s3,s4) for which [formula] and the set of all tuples (a1',a2',a3',a4',b1',b2',b3',b4',s1',s2',s3',s4') for which [formula], which preserves the value of

[formula]

or

[formula]

Furthermore, notice that (a2',a3',a4',b2',b3',b4') has exactly the same effect on the value and type of its tuple as (a2,a3,a4,b2,b3,b4) does. Hence, if we can find a bijection from the union of the set of all tuples (a1,b1,s1,s2,s3,s4) for which [formula] and the set of all tuples (a1',b1',s1',s2',s3',s4') for which [formula], to the union of the set of all tuples (a1,b1,s1,s2,s3,s4) for which [formula] and the set of all tuples (a1',b1',s1',s2',s3',s4') for which [formula], which preserves the value of

[formula]

then we can extend that bijection to the desired bijection by having it act as the identity on (a2,a3,a4,b2,b3,b4) or (a2',a3',a4',b2',b3',b4').

Now, observe that if a1 and s1, b1 and s3, a1' and s1', or b1' and s2' have different parities, then we can switch them to get a tuple with the same value but the opposite type. This allows us to cancel all such tuples. Given (a1,b1,s1,s2,s3,s4) such that a1 and s1 have the same parity and b1 and s3 have the same parity, there must exist [formula] such that (a1,s1) = z1(1,1) + z2(1, - 1) and (b1,s3) = z3(1,1) + z4(1, - 1).

Also, the value of this tuple is equal to

[formula]

and its type depends on whether [formula] is even or odd.

Similarly, given (a1',b1',s1',s2',s3',s4') such that a1' and s1' have the same parity and b1' and s2' have the same parity, there must exist [formula] such that (a1',s1') = z1'(1,1) + z2'(1, - 1) and (b1',s2') = z3'(1,1) + z4'(1, - 1). The value of this tuple is

[formula]

and its type depends on whether [formula] is even or odd.

It is easy to see that, for arbitrary (s2,z1), there exists exactly one of the following: [formula] such that (s2,z1) = x1( - 1,1) + x2(2,1); [formula] such that (s2,z1) = ( - 1,0) - x3( - 1,1) + (1 - x4)(2,1); or [formula] such that (s2,z1) = (1,0) + x5( - 1,1) + x6(2,1).

Also,

[formula]

[formula]

We have [formula]. Note that no matter what the other variables are, replacing x5 with 1 - x5 will always invert the tuple's type without affecting its value, so that map cancels out all tuples resulting from that case.

Similarly, for arbitrary (s4,z3), there exists exactly one of the following: [formula] such that ( - s4,z3) = y1( - 1,1) + y2(2,1); [formula] such that ( - s4,z3) = ( - 1,0) - y3( - 1,1) + y4(2,1); or [formula] such that ( - s4,z3) = (1,0) + y5( - 1,1) + y6(2,1).

Also,

[formula]

[formula]

We have [formula]. In the third case, replacing y5 with 1 - y5 will always invert the tuple's type without affecting its value, so this map cancels out all tuples resulting from that case.

Likewise, for arbitrary (s3',z1') there exists exactly one of the following: [formula] such that (s3',z1') = x1'( - 1,1) + x2'(2,1); [formula] such that (s3',z1') = ( - 1,0) + x3'( - 1,1) + x4'(2,1); or [formula] such that (s3',z1') = (1,0) + x5'( - 1,1) + x6'(2,1).

Also,

[formula]

[formula]

We have [formula]. In the third case, replacing x5' with 1 - x5' will always invert the tuple's type without affecting its value, while in the second case, replacing x4' by 1 - x4' will always invert the tuple's type without affecting its value. So, the only case that does not cancel itself out is the first.

Notice that (s4',z3') has exactly the same effect on the value and type of the tuple as (s3',z1'), so (s4',z3') can also be expressed in exactly one of the forms: y1'( - 1,1) + y2'(2,1), ( - 1,0) + y3'( - 1,1) + y4'(2,1), or (1,0) + y5'( - 1,1) + y6'(2,1). The maps y4'' = 1 - y4' and y5'' = 1 - y5' still cancel out all tuples covered by the second and third cases, and in the first case, we have

[formula]

and [formula].

So, any tuple that has not been canceled out by now has a value of whichever of the following is defined:

[formula]

The tuple's type depends on whether z2 + z4 + x1 + x2 + y1 + y2, z2 + z4 + x3 + x4 + y1 + y2+1, z2 + z4 + x1 + x2 + y3 + y4, z2 + z4 + x3 + x4 + y3 + y4 + 1, or z2' + z4' + x1' + x2' + y1' + y2' + 1 is even.

Notice that whichever of (z2,z4,x1,y1), (z2,z4,x3,y1), (z2,z4,x1,y3), (z2,z4,x3,y3), or (z2',z4',x1',y1') is defined has the same effect on the value and type of the tuple in every case. So, if we can find a bijection between the set of all tuples (x2,y2), (x4,y2), (x2,y4), (x4,y4), or (x2',y2') for which x2 + y2, x4 + y2 + 1, x2 + y4, x4 + y4 + 1, or x2' + y2' + 1 is even to the set of tuples of any of these types for which it is odd, which preserves

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

then we can extend it to a value-preserving bijection from the set of all remaining tuples of one type to the set of all remaining tuples of the other type, by having it leave (z2,z4,x1,y1) or its equivalent unchanged.

It is easy to see that any pair of integers can be expressed in exactly one of the forms u(1,2) + v(2, - 1), ( - 1,0) + u(1,2) + v(2, - 1), (1,0) + u(1,2) + v(2, - 1), (0, - 1) + u(1,2) + v(2, - 1), or (0,1) + u(1,2) + v(2, - 1), with u and v integers.

For arbitrary integers u and v, each of the following pairs of tuples has the same value and opposite types:

[formula]

Each tuple of the form (x2,y2), (x2,y4), (x4,y2), (x4,y4), or (x2',y2') is stated to have the same value as another tuple by exactly one of these. The only time a tuple shows up more than once on the same line is if it can be expressed in the forms on each side, and all such lines are involutions. Therefore, these equalities combine to yield a value-preserving bijection from the tuples of one type to the tuples of the other type. We have already shown that this is sufficient to prove the lemma.

Notice that the last conjecture is already known to be true analytically, thanks to a result of N. D. Baruah and B. C. Berndt (see [\cite=BB], Theorem 8.1). In fact, as the authors of [\cite=BB] remarked in the introduction to their paper, the partition identity of Corollary to Conjecture [\ref=c0] is particularly interesting, since it arises from another exceptional modular equation discovered by Ramanujan. However, unlike the five equations of the Schröter, Russell and Ramanujan type, the degree of the modular equation corresponding to Corollary to Conjecture [\ref=c0] is 15, hence not a prime.
