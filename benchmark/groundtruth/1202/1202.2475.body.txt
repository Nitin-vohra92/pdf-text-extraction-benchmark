On the speed of convergence of Newton's method for complex polynomials

Introduction

Newton's root finding method is an old and classical method for finding roots of a differentiable function; it goes back to Newton in the 18th century, perhaps earlier. It was one of the main reasons why A. Douady, J. Hubbard and others in the late 1970s studied iterations of complex analytic functions. The main question was to know where to start the Newton iterative method in order to converge to the roots of the polynomial. Newton's method is known as rapidly converging near the roots (usually with quadratic convergence), but had a reputation that its global dynamics was difficult to understand, so that in practice other methods for root finding were used. See [\cite=JohannesNewtonSurvey] for an overview on recent results about Newton's method.

Meanwhile, some small sets of good starting points are known: there are explicit deterministic sets with O(d log 2d) points that are guaranteed to find all roots of appropriately normalized polynomials of degree d [\cite=HSS], and probabilistic sets with as few as O(d( log  log d)2) points [\cite=BLS].

We are interested in the question how many iterations are required until all roots are found with prescribed precision ε. In [\cite=D], it is shown that among a set of starting points as specified above, there are d points that converge to the d roots and require at most O(d4 log 2d + d3 log 2d| log ε|) to get ε-close to the d roots in the worst case; for randomly placed roots (or for roots at mutual distance at least δ for some δ > 0), the required number of iterations is no more than O(d3 log 3d + d log | log ε|) (with the constant depending on δ). This is about one power of d away from the best possible bounds.

In this paper, we show that Newton's method is about as fast as theoretically possible. We consider the space of polynomials of degree d, normalized so as to have all roots in the complex unit disk [formula]. Our main result is the following.

For every degree d, there is an explicit universal set Sd of points in [formula], with |Sd| = 3.33d log 2d(1 + o(1)), with the following property: suppose that [formula] are uniformly and independently distributed in the unit disk and put [formula]. Then there are d starting points in Sd such that with probability pd  →  1 as d  →    ∞  , the number of iterations needed to approximate all d roots with precision ε starting at these d points is

[formula]

As stated, the theorem deals with d distinguishable (i.e., ordered) roots and their associated probability distribution. We prove that the same result holds if we identify our polynomials in terms of their sets of indistinguishable roots, as two polynomials [formula] and [formula] are the same if their unordered sets of roots [formula] and [formula] are equal.

This bound on the number of iterations is optimal in the sense that there is no bound on the number of iterations in the same generality that for fixed ε has asymptotics in o(d2), so we are away from the best possible bound only by a factor of about O( log 4d).

Good starting points for Newton's method

Studying the geometry of the immediate basins outside the unit disk [formula], in [\cite=HSS] we proved the existence of a universal starting set with 1.11d log 2d points depending only on d such that for every polynomial of degree d with all roots in the unit disk, and for every root, there is a point in the set which is in the immediate basin of this root. Enlarging the set by a factor of 3 approximately, in [\cite=D] we obtained a set of starting points Sd which ensured that for each polynomial p and each root α there is a point z in Sd intersecting the immediate basin U of α in the "middle third" of the "thickest" channel, where a channel is an unbounded connected component of [formula]. Being in this middle third implies an upper bound on the displacement dU(z,Np(z)) in terms of the Poincaré metric of the immediate basin. It also turns out that the orbit of z under iteration of Newton map does not leave DR(0), the disk of radius R centered at the origin for some bounded value of R. We will refer to such points as having R-central orbits.

More precisely, let Sd be defined as follows.

For each degree d, construct a circular grid Sd as follows. For [formula], set

[formula]

and for each circle around 0 of radius rk, choose ⌈8.33d log d⌉ equidistant points (independently for all the circles).

The set Sd thus constructed has 3.33(1 + o(1))d log 2d points. The following theorem is proven in [\cite=D].

For each degree d, the set Sd has the following universal property. If p is any complex polynomial, normalized so that all its roots are in [formula], then there are d points [formula] in Sd whose Newton iterations converge to the d roots of p. If α is a root of p and U is the immediate basin of α, then there is an index i such that z(i)∈U with dU(z(i),Np(z(i))) < 2 log d. In addition, [formula] have R-central orbits for

[formula]

For d  =  100, we have R  <  14; for d  =  1000, we have R  <  7.5; and asymptotically the upper bound on R tends to 7.

The result provides an upper bound for R that is uniform in d. This set of starting points will be the basis for the discussion which follows.

Uniformly distributed roots

In this manuscript we investigate the Newton map for complex polynomials with randomly distributed roots. In this section, we fix notation and give the strategy of the proof of our main result, Theorem [\ref=Thm:Main].

Let α be a simple root of the polynomial p of degree d and U be the immediate basin of attraction of α. By the discussion in the previous section, there exists z1∈Sd with R-central orbit in U, i.e. under iteration of the Newton map Np the orbit converges to α and stays within DR(0). Let zn + 1: = Np(zn) for n  ≥  1. For any two consecutive points zn and zn + 1 along the orbit of z1, in [\cite=D] we constructed "thick" curves that, roughly speaking, "use up" area at least |zn  -  zn + 1|2 / (2τ) with τ: = dU(z1,z2)  <  2 log d. In the region of quadratic convergence (near the root α), only log 2| log 2ε  -  5| iterations are sufficient to get ε-close to the root. Outside this region, two such curves with base points zn and zn' are disjoint if n'  -  n  ≥  2τ  +  6 [\cite=D]. The bound O(d3 log 3d  +  d log | log ε|) follows from lower bounds on the displacements |zn  -  zn + 1| along the orbit. The main improvement in this paper is on the lower bounds on the displacements when the roots are randomly distributed.

As in [\cite=D], we partition DR(0) (the disk of radius R centered at the origin) into domains

[formula]

It turns out that if the roots are randomly distributed in the unit disk, then with high probability the following holds: there exists a universal constant C such that for every n we have the following estimates

[formula]

If zn∈Sk with k  ≤   log 2d, then we say that we are "in the far case", as zn is far from all the roots. Since each such iteration uses an area of at least |zn - zn + 1|2 / (2τ), and one in 2τ + 6 such areas are disjoint, the total number of orbit points in the far case is bounded by O(d2 log 4d).

[\cite=D] says that if the orbit gets very close to some root in comparison to the other roots, then it has entered the region of quadratic convergence of that root where only log 2| log 2ε  -  5| are sufficient to approximate it within an ε-neighborhood. We call this "the near case".

For randomly distributed roots, the mutual distance between roots is large enough so away from the region of quadratic convergence, we only need to consider k  ≤  3 + (2 + η) log 2d for a certain η > 0. We define the "intermediate case" as those zn∈Sk with log 2d < k  ≤  3 + (2 + η) log 2d. Each domain Sk has area O(d4- k), and each iteration with zn∈Sk uses area about (C / 2kk)2 / 2τ  ≈  C2 / 4kk2τ, so the number of orbit points in the intermediate case is at most O(dk2τ) for each k, times the usual factor 2τ + 6 to make the areas disjoint. But log 2d < k  ≤  3 + (2 + η) log 2d and τ = O( log d), so the total number of iterations in the intermediate case is O(d log 5d).

In the subsequent sections we will make these arguments precise.

On the distribution of the roots

In order to get a lower bound on the expected displacement, we will first investigate the distribution of the roots. We will be interested in two different kind of probability spaces. The first space [formula] consists of all polynomials with d distinguishable roots in the unit disk, normalized so as to have leading coefficients 1, and the probability measure is induced by the Lebesgue measure on [formula]. The second space Pd / Sd consists of all polynomials with indistinguishable roots in the unit disk, i.e. the quotient probability space of the standard action of the symmetric group Sd on Pd defined by permuting the roots.

The following lemma is the probabilistic ingredient of the main theorem. It certainly isn't new, but easier verified than looked up in the library.

Let Md be the set of all d-digit numbers in base d.

(a) The probability that that a randomly chosen number a∈Md does not have a digit repeating more than O( log d) times is at least 1 - 1 / d.

(b) Let ~   be an equivalence relation on Md defined as follows: [formula] with a  =  σb, i.e. two elements are equivalent if they have the same sets of digits counted with multiplicities. Then the probability that a randomly chosen element ∈Md  /    ~   does not have a digit repeating more than O( log d) is at least 1 - 1 / d.

(a) For fixed i, the number of d-digit numbers which contain at least α digits i is at most [formula]. Thus the number of d-digit numbers which contain a symbol repeating at least α times is at most

[formula]

So the probability that a randomly selected number in Md contains at least α identical digits is at most [formula] since |Md|  =  dd. Therefore, with probability at least [formula], a randomly selected number in Md does not have a digit repeating more than α times.

Note that if α!  ≥  d2 we have [formula]. Therefore, by taking α such that (α  -  1)!  <  d2  ≤  α! (which implies that α∈O( log d)), we prove the first part of the claim.

(b) Note that the elements of Md  /    ~   can be bijectively mapped to the set [formula] as follows: for ∈Md  /    ~   let xi be the multiplicity of digit i in every a∈[a]. It is well known and easy to see that

[formula]

Thus we have [formula]. On the other hand, the number of elements in [formula] with first component at least α is equal to the cardinality of

[formula]

which has the same cardinality as

[formula]

Again by ([\ref=eq:_multiset_coefficient]) this quantity equals to [formula]. Therefore, the number of elements of [formula] with a component at least α, i.e. the number of elements of Md  /    ~   with a digit repeating at least α times, is at most

[formula]

Hence the probability that a number of Md  /    ~   has a digit repeating at least α times is at most

[formula]

[formula]

Hence for α  =  ⌈2 log 2d  +  1⌉∈O( log d) the second part of the claim follows.

The statement remains true if we replace the probability 1 - 1 / d by 1 - 1 / dc for any constant c  ≥  1.

If the roots are randomly distributed in the unit disk one should expect that the number of roots in a region is proportional to its area. The previous claim easily implies the following statement.

Let a polynomial with roots [formula] be randomly chosen in Pd or Pd / Sd. Then there exists a constant Cd∈O( log d) such that with probability at least 1 - 1 / d the following holds true: every disk in [formula] with area A  =  πr2 contains at most k(A) points among [formula] with

[formula]

Without loss of generality we can assume that d  =  (2k + 1)2 for an integer k (the general case follows by enlarging C(2k + 1)2 by a bounded factor). Then the unit disk can be subdivided into d pieces as follows (compare Fig. [\ref=fig:_circle_partitioned]): the first piece is a disk with center 0 and radius [formula] next, consider the annuli As bounded between circles around 0 of radii (2s - 1)r0 and (2s + 1)r0 for [formula], and subdivide each annulus As into exactly 8s pieces of equal area by drawing 8s radial segments. Thus we construct exactly d pieces with equal area and diameters comparable with r0. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:_numbers] it follows that each of the pieces contains at most O( log d) of the points [formula] with probability at least 1 - 1 / d (in both cases of distinguishable and indistinguishable roots): in the case of distinguishable roots, the i-th digit of a d-digit number specifies the number of the piece containing the i-th root; in the other case, the same symmetries apply on both sides of the equality.

Hence, the claim is true for that particular partition of the unit disk. This implies the general claim as follows. It is easy to see that each square of side length at most r0 in the complex plane can intersect at most a constant number C' of these pieces, where C' does not depend on d. Consider a square S for which the unit circle is inscribed, for example the one with sides parallel to the real and imaginary axes. Subdivide it into d equal squares of side length r0 (using the fact that d is a square and [formula]). Then each of these smaller squares will intersect at most C' pieces from the partition of the unit disk (some squares will not intersect any). Therefore each of the small squares contains at most C'' log d points for some constant C'' which does not depend on d. Since each square of side length r0 (possibly rotated) intersects at most 9 of these squares dividing S, we conclude that each square of side length r0 contains, with probability at least 1 - 1 / d, at most C log d of the points [formula] for C  =  9C''. If we group every 4 neighboring small squares (of side length r0) and repeat the argument, we get that each square of side length 2r0 contains at most 4C log d points, and so on for squares of side length [formula]. Thus an arbitrary square of side length x∈[2kr0,2k  +  1r0] contains at most 22k  +  2C log d  ≤  4C(x2 / r20) log d  ≈  4Cx2d log d points since it is contained some square of side length 2k + 1r0, and thus enlarging the constant by a factor of 4 the lemma will hold true for squares. Since each disk of radius r is contained in a square of side length 2r, the bound on the number of points in an arbitrary disk follows.

Now we prove the following claim about the mutual distance for randomly distributed points in the unit disk.

Let the polynomial p(z) be randomly chosen in Pd or Pd / Sd. Then the mutual distance between any pair of its roots is at least 1  /  d1  +  η, for any fixed η > 0, with probability at least 1 - 1 / d2η.

First, note that the claim for a randomly chosen polynomial in Pd / Sd follows from the claim for a randomly chosen polynomial in Pd. Choosing randomly a polynomial in Pd is equivalent to choosing randomly and independently its roots. For a positive number r, the probability pd,r that d uniformly and independently distributed points in the unit disk have mutual distance at least r is at least

[formula]

(the unit disk has area π, and after k roots are selected, the k + 1-st root must avoid an area of at most kπr2; this has probability (π  -  πkr2) / π = 1 - kr2).

Since log (1 + x)  ≥  x / (1 + x) for x >  - 1, we get

[formula]

where the last inequality holds if dr2  <  1 / 2. Hence

[formula]

If r  =  1 / d1 + η (which satisfies dr2  <  1 / 2), then pd,r  ≥  1 - 1 / d2η and thus the claim follows.

The precise value of η in this lemma is not very important to us, as eventually it will only affect constants in the bounds we obtain.

An immediate corollary of the lemma is an upper bound on the distance of zn to the closest root which guarantees quadratic convergence.

If the d roots are randomly chosen and zn∈Sk with 2- k  <  1  /  8d2  +  η and η > 0, then with probability at least 1 - 1 / d2η the orbit of zn converges to the closest root α, and log 2| log 2ε  -  5| iterations of zn are sufficient to get ε-close to α.

Indeed, if zn∈Sk and α is the closest root to zn, then |zn  -  α|  <  1  /  8d2  +  η and for every root αj  ≠  α we have

[formula]

(under the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lemma:_mutual_distance]). Therefore by [\cite=D], we need no more than log 2| log 2ε  -  5| iterations to get ε-close to α.

We combine the previous two lemmas in the following claim.

Let a polynomial with roots [formula] be randomly chosen in Pd or Pd / Sd. Then with probability pd  ≥  1 - O(d- 2η) (for fixed η∈(0,1 / 2)), the following two statements simultaneously hold true:

We are interested in P(AC  =  DC  =  ), which equals

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:disk] we have P(AC  =  )  ≤  1 / d, and by Lemma [\ref=lemma:_mutual_distance] P(DC  =  )  ≤  1 / d2η. Hence the claim follows.

Proof of the main theorem

In this section we will use the two conditions AC and DC to prove Theorem [\ref=Thm:Main]. While DC guarantees that proximity to a root implies fast convergence (Corollary [\ref=cor:_bound_on_K]), AC gives a lower bound on the displacements along an orbit far away from the roots. More precisely, the following statement holds true.

Suppose that the Area Condition in Lemma [\ref=lemma:_probabilistic_conditions] holds true. If [formula], then

[formula]

where Cd∈O( log d). If [formula], then |zn  -  zn + 1|  >  1 / d.

The fact that zn∈SK means that the closest root, say α, is at distance c  /  2K for some c∈(0.5,1], and all the other roots satisfy |zn  -  αj|  ≥  c  /  2K.

First suppose that [formula]. This implies that K  ≥   - 2. Let [formula] for [formula]. Then all the roots are contained in [formula]. The Area Condition implies that there exists a constant Cd∈O( log d) such that the number of roots in Tk is bounded by πCdd4- k for π4- k  ≥  1 / d, and by Cd otherwise. Thus we have

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

For the case [formula] we have

[formula]

and so |zn  -  zn + 1|  >  1 / d.

Suppose that the Area Condition in Lemma [\ref=lemma:_probabilistic_conditions] holds true. Then there is a universal constant C such that the following statements hold for any zn∈Sk.

If 2- k  ≥  1 / d, then [formula].

If 1 / 8d2 + η  ≤  2- k  <  1 / d, then [formula].

For [formula], Lemma [\ref=lemma:_main] gives

[formula]

If 2- k  ≥  1 / d, i.e., 2k + 1  ≤  2d, the denominator is at most O(Cdd), so the displacement is at least C' / (d log d) for some universal constant C' (since Cd∈O( log d)). On the other hand, if 1 / 8d2 + η  ≤  2- k  <  1 / d and thus d  <  2k, the denominator is at most O(Cd2k). In this case, Cd∈O( log d)  =  O(k), so the displacement is at least C'' / (k2k). Therefore the claim follows if we take C  =   min {C',C''}.

Finally, [formula] implies k  <   - 1. Again Lemma [\ref=lemma:_main] gives |zn  -  zn + 1|  >  1 / d, and thus we finish the proof by possibly decreasing the constant C.

The final step towards proving our main result is in the following theorem.

Let the polynomial p(z) be randomly chosen in Pd or Pd / Sd and let (zn) be an R-central orbit converging to a root α with dU(z0,z1)  ≤  τ for τ  <  2 log d. Then with probability pd  ≥  1 - O(d- 2η) (for fixed η∈(0,1 / 2)), the required number of iterations for z0 to get ε-close to α is

[formula]

Before proceeding to the proof of this statement, we will outline the main idea. As in [\cite=D], we construct "thick" curves connecting orbit points zn and zn + 1 that use up certain area contained in a bounded domain. Far from the root, two curves corresponding to zn and zm are disjoint provided that |n - m|  >  2τ  +  6. A lower bound on the area of the "thick" curves gives an upper bound on the number of iterations. Also, near the root the orbit enters the domain of quadratic convergence where only a few iterations are sufficient to approximate the root.

More precisely, let [formula] be the Riemann map with φ(α)  =  0 considered in [\cite=D]. If |φ(zn)|  <  1 / 2 ("region of fast convergence"), then according to [\cite=D] we need only log 2| log 2ε  -  5| iterations to get ε-close to the root α. For orbit points with φ-images having absolute values greater than e1 / 2  -  1, we can prove the following.

For every n with |φ(zn)|  >  e1 / 2  -  1, there are open connected subsets Vn  ⊂  D2R + 2(0) with zn,zn + 1∈∂Vn and |Vn|  ≥  |zn - zn + 1|2 / 2τ, having the following property: whenever n and m are such that min {|φ(zn)|,|φ(zm)|}  >  e1 / 2  -  1 and |n - m|  ≥  ⌈2τ + 6⌉, we have [formula].

Let γ:[0,s]  →  U be the hyperbolic geodesic within U connecting zn to zn + 1. For each z = γ(t), let η(t) be the Euclidean distance from γ(t) to ∂U, and let Xt be the straight line segment (without endpoints) perpendicular to γ(t) of Euclidean length η(t), centered at γ(t). Let [formula]. Then all Vn are open and connected and zn,zn + 1∈∂Vn, and the area of Vn is at least |zn - zn + 1|2 / 2τ: this follows as in [\cite=D] (in this reference, the areas restricted to certain domains Sk are calculated; omitting this restriction, we obtain the result we need, and the computations only get simpler). Moreover, the orbit (zn) is R-central and the unit disk contains other roots than α, and hence the length of γ(t) for t∈[0,s] is bounded by R + 1. This implies that all pieces Vn are contained in D2R + 2(0) by construction.

The fact that [formula] are disjoint when |n - m| > 2τ + 6 is proved in [\cite=D] (again for restricted domains, but this is immaterial for the proof).

We only need to consider iteration points whose images under φ have absolute values at least e1 / 2  -  1. Also, by Lemma  [\ref=lemma:_probabilistic_conditions], the conditions AC and DC hold true with probability pd  ≥  1 - O(d- 2η).

Choose M so that 2M  -  1 > 2R + 2. We distinguish the following three cases.

Moreover, the pieces of area for the iterations zn  ↦  zn + 1 and zn'  ↦  zn' + 1 are disjoint provided that n - n'  ≥  2τ  +  6, and all these pieces of area are contained in the disk D2R + 2(0) with R universally bounded.

for a universal constant C'.

orbit points for some universal constant C''. There are 3 + (1 + η) log d possible values of k in the Intermediate Case, so [formula] (for all k in the Intermediate Case) can accommodate at most

orbit points for some universal constant C''.

Since τ∈O( log d) and the Far Case dominates the Intermediate Case, the claim follows.

We now conclude the main statement.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:_set_of_starting_points], for each root there is a starting point satisfying the conditions of the theorem. In particular, these orbits are R-central for a universally bounded value of R. Note that the d roots have to compete for the available area in D2R + 2(0). Since the estimates in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:one_root] are based on the area (except for the Near Case where the orbit gets to the region of quadratic convergence), we get the same estimate for the combined number of iterations (except that the estimate log | log ε| applies for each root separately, thus it is multiplied by d).

This result is close to optimal in the sense that the power of d cannot be reduced for our universal set of starting points that is bounded away from the unit disk. The reason is that outside the unit disk Np is conjugate to the linear map [formula] by [\cite=HSS], so at least O(d) iterations are required for each "good" starting point to get close to the unit disk where the roots are located, and at least O(d2) for all the d starting points combined.
