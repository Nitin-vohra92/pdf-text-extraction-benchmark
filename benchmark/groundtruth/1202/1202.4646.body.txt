Publication Trends in Astronomy: The Lone Author

This communication illustrates the trend discussed by Mott Greene in the essay "The demise of the lone author" ([\citet=greene2007]). Trends are likely to be different for different disciplines. As Mott observes: "In most fields outside mathematics, fewer and fewer people know enough to work and write alone". In addition to this, in most disciplines large (and often multi-national) collaborations have become more common and even unavoidable, because it is the only way to get sufficient funding.

Figure [\ref=fig:figure1] is an illustration of how the distribution of the number of authors has changed over time in the main astronomy journals (The Astrophysical Journal, The Astronomical Journal, Monthly Notices of the R.A.S. and Astronomy & Astrophysics).

Figure [\ref=fig:figure2] highlights the "demise of the lone author" by showing the change in the fraction of single author papers in the main astronomy journals. The fraction in the main physics journals (Physical Review, Nuclear Physics, Physics Letters) has been added for comparison.

The drop in the astronomy journals is more dramatic than for the physics journals. A factor of about 10 versus a factor of about 3 or 4.
