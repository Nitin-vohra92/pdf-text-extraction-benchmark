Unbounded Growth of Entanglement in Models of Many-Body Localization

One of the most remarkable predictions of quantum mechanics is that an arbitrarily weak random potential is sufficient to localize all energy eigenstates of a single particle moving in one dimension [\cite=Anderson:1958fz] [\cite=Lee:1985hn]. In experiments on electronic systems, observation of localization is limited to low temperatures because the interaction of an electron with its environment results in a loss of quantum coherence and a crossover to classical transport. Recent work has proposed that, if there are electron-electron interactions but the electronic system is isolated from other degrees of freedom (such as phonons), there can be a "many-body localization transition" even in a one-dimensional system for which all the single-particle states are localized [\cite=Basko:2006hh] [\cite=Oganesyan:2007ex] [\cite=Monthus:2010gd] [\cite=Berkelbach:2010ib] [\cite=Pal:2010gr] [\cite=Canovi:2011jd].

Two important developments may enable progress on many-body localization beyond past efforts using analytical perturbation theory. The first is that numerical methods like matrix-product-state based methods and large scale exact diagonalizations enable studies of some, not all, important quantities in large systems. The second is that progress in creating atomic systems where interactions between particles are strong but the overall many-atom system is highly phase coherent [\cite=Kinoshita:2006bg] suggests that this many-body localization transition may be observable in experiments [\cite=Aleiner:2010ir] [\cite=inguscio:2012]. Note that many-body localization is connected to the problem of thermalization in closed quantum systems as a localized system does not thermalize.

The goal of the present work is to show that the many-body localized phase differs qualitatively, even for weak interactions, from the conventional, noninteracting localized phase. The evolution of two quantities studied, the entanglement entropy and particle number fluctuations, show logarithmically slow evolution more characteristic of a glassy phase; however, the long-term behavior of these quantities is quite different. The growth of the entanglement entropy has previously been observed [\cite=DeChiara:2006fo] [\cite=Znidaric:2008cr] to show roughly logarithmic evolution for smaller systems and stronger interactions. We seek here to study this behavior systematically over a wide range of time scales (up to [formula]), showing that the logarithmic growth begins for arbitrarily weak interactions. We show that the entanglement growth does not saturate in the thermodynamic limit, and obtain additional quantities that distinguish among possible mechanisms. Further discussion of our conclusions appears after the model, methods, and numerical results are presented.

Model system. - One-dimensional (1D) [formula] spin chains are a natural place to look for many-body localization [\cite=Oganesyan:2007ex] as they are equivalent to 1D spinless lattice fermions. To start, consider the XX model with random z directed magnetic fields so that the total magnetization Sz is conserved:
