Introduction

Von Rickenbach  [\cite=vR05] [\cite=rwz09] introduce the notion of (maximum receiver-centric) interference in wireless networks and argue that topology-control algorithms for wireless networks should explicitly take this parameter into account. Indeed, they show that the minimum spanning tree, which seems a natural choice to reduce interference, can be very bad; there exists a set of node locations in which the minimum spanning tree of the nodes produces a network with maximum interference that is linear in the number, n, of nodes, but a more carefully chosen network has constant maximum interference, independent of n. These results are, however, worst-case; the set of node locations that achieve this are very carefully chosen. In particular, the ratio of the distance between the furthest and closest pair of nodes is exponential in the number of nodes.

The current paper continues the study of maximum interference, but in a model that is closer to a typical case. In particular, we consider what happens when the nodes are distributed uniformly, and independently, in the unit square. This distribution assumption can be used to approximately model the unorganized nature of ad-hoc networks and is commonly used in simulations of such networks [\cite=tma09]. Additionally, some types of sensor networks, especially with military applications, are specifically designed to be deployed by randomly placing (scattering) them in the deployment area. This distribution assumption models these applications very well.

Our results show that the maximum interference, in this case, is very far from the worst-case. In particular, for points independently and uniformly distributed in the unit square, the maximum interference of the minimum spanning tree grows only like the square root of the logarithm of the number of nodes. That is, the maximum interference is not even logarithmic in the number of nodes. Furthermore, a more carefully chosen network topology can reduce the maximum interference further still, to the cubed root of the logarithm of n.

The Model

Let [formula] be a set of n points in [formula] and let G = (V,E) be a simple undirected graph with vertex set V. The graph G defines a set, B(G), of closed balls [formula], where Bi has center xi and radius

[formula]

(Here, and throughout, [formula] denotes the Euclidean distance between points x and y.) In words, Bi is just large enough to enclose all of xi's neighbours in G. The (maximum receiver-centric) interference at a point, x, is the number of these balls that contain x, i.e.,

[formula]

The (maximum receiver-centric) interference of G is the maximum interference at any vertex of G, i.e.,

[formula]

shows an example of a geometric graph G and the balls B(G). Each node, x, is labelled with I(x,G).

One of the goals of network design is to build, given V, a connected graph G = (V,E) such that I(G) is minimized. Thus, it is natural to consider interference as a property of the given point set, V, defined as

[formula]

A minimum spanning tree of V is a connected graph, [formula], of minimum total edge length. Minimum spanning trees are a natural choice for low-interference graphs. The purpose of the current paper is to prove the following results (here, and throughout, the phrase with high probability means with probability that approaches 1 as n  →    ∞  ):

Let V be a set of n points independently and uniformly distributed in d. With high probability,

[formula];

I(V)∈O(( log n)1 / 3), for d∈{1,2}; and

I(V)∈O(( log n)1 / 3( log  log n)1 / 2), for d  ≥  3.

Let V be a set of n points independently and uniformly distributed in d. With high probability,

[formula]

I(V)∈Ω(( log n)1 / 4).

Related Work

This section surveys previous work on the problem of bounding the interference of worst-case and random point sets. A summary of the results described in this section is given in . In the statements of all results in this section, |V| = n.

The definition of interference used in this paper was introduced by von Rickenbach  [\cite=vR05] who proved upper and lower bounds on the interference of one dimensional point sets:

For any d  ≥  1, there exists [formula] such that I(V)∈Ω(n1 / 2).

The point set, V, in this lower-bound consists of any sequence of points [formula], all on a line, such that [formula], for all [formula]. That is, the gaps between consecutive points decrease exponentially.

This lower bound is matched by an upper-bound:

For all [formula], I(V)∈O(n1 / 2).

The upper bound in is obtained by selecting n1 / 2 vertices to act as hubs, connecting the hubs into any connected network and then having each of the remaining nodes connect to its nearest hub. This idea was extended to two and higher dimensions by Halldórsson and Tokuyama [\cite=ht08], by using a special type of (n- 1 / 2)-net as the set of hubs:

For all [formula],

I(V)∈O(n1 / 2) for d = 2; and

I(V)∈O((n log n)1 / 2), for d  ≥  3.

Several authors have shown that the interference of a point set is related to the (logarithm of) the ratio between the longest and shortest distance defined by the point set. In particular, different versions of the following theorem have been proven by Halldórsson and Tokuyama [\cite=ht08]; Khabbazian, Durocher, and Haghnegahdar [\cite=kdh11]; and Maheshwari, Smid, and Zeh [\cite=msz11]:

For any constant d  ≥  1 and for all [formula], I(V) = O( log D), where [formula].

At least two of the proofs of proceed by showing that [formula]. A strengthening of this theorem is that the numerator in the definition of D can be replaced with the length of the longest edge in [formula] [\cite=kdh11] [\cite=msz11].

suggests that point sets with very high interference are unlikely to occur in practice. This intuition is born out by the results of Kranakis  [\cite=kkmns10], who show that high interference is unlikely to occur in random point sets in one dimension:

Let V be a set of n points independently and uniformly distributed in

[formula]

Note that, in this one-dimensional case, the minimum spanning tree, [formula], is simply a path that connects the points of V in order, from left to right. Taken together, Part 1 of Theorems [\ref=thm:main] and [\ref=thm:lower-bound] generalize to arbitrary constant dimensions d  ≥  1.

In higher dimensions, Khabbazian, Durocher, and Haghnegahdar [\cite=kdh11] use their version of to show that minimum spanning trees of random point sets have at most logarithmic interference.

Let V be a set of n points independently and uniformly distributed in d. Then, with high probability, [formula].

Part 1 of improves the upper bound in to O(( log n)1 / 2) and Part 1 of gives a matching lower bound.

The second parts of Theorems [\ref=thm:main] and [\ref=thm:lower-bound] show that minimum spanning trees do not minimize interference, even for random point sets. For random point sets, one can construct networks with interference O(( log n)1 / 3) and the best networks have interference in Ω(( log n)1 / 4).

The remainder of this paper is devoted to proving Theorems [\ref=thm:main] and [\ref=thm:lower-bound]. For ease of exposition, we only present these proofs for the case d = 2 though they generalize, in a straightforward way, to arbitrary (constant) dimensions.

Proof of the Upper Bounds ()

In this section, we prove . However, before we do this, we state a slightly modified version of that is needed in our proof.

Let [formula], let r > 0, and let [formula] denote the subgraph of [formula] containing only the edges whose length is in (r,2r]. Then [formula].

(This proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 3 in Ref. [\cite=msz11].) Let x be any point in [formula] and let B the set of all balls in [formula] that contain x so that, by definition [formula].

Refer to for what follows. All the centers of balls in B are contained in a ball of radius 2r centered at x. Therefore, a simple packing argument implies that there exists a ball, b, of radius r / 2 that contains at least |B| / 5d centers of balls in B. (5d is the volume of a ball of radius 5r / 2 divided by the volume of a ball of radius r / 2.) The center of each of these ball is the endpoint of an edge of length at most 2r. The other endpoints of these edges are all contained in a ball of radius 5r / 2 centered around b. The same packing argument shows that we can find a ball of radius r / 2 that contains at least |B| / (5  ·  6)d of these other endpoints.

We claim that this implies that |B| / 30d  <  2 (so |B| < 2  ·  30d). Otherwise, [formula] contains two edges, xixj and [formula], each of length greater than r and such that [formula] and [formula]. But this contradicts the minimality of [formula], since one could replace xixj with one of xixk or [formula] and obtain a spanning tree of smaller total edge length. We conclude that |Si| < 2  ·  30d, and this completes the proof.

Note that implies , since it implies that we can partition the edges of [formula] into ⌈ log 2D⌉ classes, based on length, and each class will contain only a constant number of edges.

We are ready to prove Parts 2 and 3 of . The sketch of the proof is as follows: We partition d into equal cubes of volume 1 / nt, for some parameter t to be chosen later. Using Chernoff's bounds, we show that each cube contains O(( log n)2 / 3) points so that the points within each cube can be connected, using the results of Halldórsson and Tokuyama, with maximum interference O(( log n)1 / 3). Next, the cubes are connected to other cubes by selecting one point in each cube and connecting these selected points with a minimum spanning tree. is then used to show that this minimum spanning tree has maximum interference O(( log n)1 / 3). Without further ado, we present:

Partition 2 into square cells of area 1 / nt for some value t to be specified later. Let Ni denote the number of points that are contained in the ith cell. Then Ni is binomial with mean μ = 1 / t. Recall Chernoff's Bounds [\cite=c52] on the tails of binomial random variables:

[formula]

In our setting, we have,

[formula]

for t = 2( log n)1 / 3 and k = (c + 2)( log n)2 / 3.

Note that the number of cells is no more than nt  ≤  n2, for sufficiently large n. Therefore, by the union bound, the probability that there exists any cell containing more than k points is at most n- c.

Within each non-empty cell, we apply to connect the vertices in the ith cell into a connected graph Gi with [formula]. In fact, a somewhat stronger result holds, namely that [formula]. Notice that each edge in Gi has length at most [formula]. Stated another way, in [formula], any point, x, receives interference only from cells within distance [formula] of the cell containing x. There are only 25 such cells, so

[formula]

with high probability.

Thus far, the points within each cell are connected to each other and the maximum interference, over all points in [formula], is [formula]. To connect the cells to each other, we select one point from each non-empty cell and connect these using a minimum spanning tree, T. What remains is to show that the additional interference caused by the addition of the edges in T does not exceed O(( log n)1 / 3).

Suppose that I(x,T) = r, for some point [formula]. There are at most 9 vertices in T whose distance to x is less than [formula]. Therefore, by , T must contain an edge of length at least [formula], for some constant c > 1.

A well-known property of minimum spanning trees is that, for any edge xixj in T, the open ball with diameter xixj does not contain any vertices of T. In our setting, this means that there is an open ball, B, of radius [formula] such that every cell contained in B contains no point of V. Inside of B is another empty ball B' of radius [formula] whose center is also the center of some cell.

At least one quarter of the area of B' is contained in 2, so the number of cells completely contained in B' is at least [formula]. By decreasing c slightly, and only considering r larger than a sufficiently large constant, r0, we can simplify this number of cells to πc2r / 16.

For a fixed ball B', the probability that the cπ22r / 16 cells defined by B' are empty of points in V is at most

[formula]

for r  ≥   log (16 / cπ) +  log t  +   log (2 + c') +  log  ln n. By the union bound, the probability that there exists any such B' is at most pnt  ≤  1 / nc'. Since we can choose r∈O( log t +  log  log n)  =  O(( log n)1 / 3), this completes the proof.

The proof of Part 1 of is just a matter of reusing the ideas from the previous proof of Parts 2 and 3.

Let x be any point in [formula]. We partition the balls in [formula] that contain x into three sets:

the set B0 of balls having area at most 1 / nt;

the set B1 of balls having area in the range

[formula]

In this proof, the parameter t = 2( log n)1 / 2.

The set B0 consists of points contained in a ball of area 1 / nt centered at x. Exactly the same argument used in the first part of the previous proof shows that, with high probability, every such ball contains O(( log n)1 / 2) points, so

[formula]

The set B1 consists of balls whose radii are in the range

[formula]

Proof of The Lower Bounds ()

In this section, we prove the lower bounds in . We define a Zeno configuration as follows (see ): A Zeno configuration of size k, centered at a point, x, is defined by a set of k + 1 balls. The construction starts with disjoint balls [formula], each having radius u. The ball D0 is centered at x. The center of Di, [formula] is at x + (u3i,0). A final large ball, D, of radius r = u3k is centered at x and contains all other balls. A Zeno configuration occurs at location x in a point set V when D contains exactly k points of V and these occur with exactly one point in each ball Di.

The following lemma shows that a Zeno configuration in V causes high interference in [formula].

If V contains a Zeno configuration of size k, [formula].

Let xi, [formula], denote the point of V contained in Di. Note that, for [formula] the closest point to xi in V is xi - 1. Since [formula] contains the nearest-neighbour graph, this implies that [formula] contains the edges xixi + 1 for all [formula]. See for what follows. We claim that, for all [formula], the ball Bi centered at xi that contains xi + 1 also contains x0. This is clearly true for i = 0 and i = 1. Next, note that

[formula]

On the other hand, for i  ≥  2,

[formula]

Therefore, [formula].

The next lemma shows that a Zeno configuration causes high interference on any connected graph on vertex set V.

If V contains a Zeno configuration of size k, then [formula].

Let G be any connected graph on V. Using the same notation as in the proof of , call a vertex, xi, a big one if xi is adjacent to any vertex xj, with j > i, or xi is adjacent to any vertex x not in D. The proof of shows that every big one contributes to the interference at x0. Therefore, if the Zeno configuration contains [formula] or more big ones, then [formula] and there is nothing left to prove. Otherwise, note that each of [formula] is either a big one or adjacent to a big one. Therefore, there must be a big one, xi, with degree at least [formula], so [formula].

To prove , all that remains is to show a Zeno configuration of size Ω(( log n)1 / 2) occurs in V with high probability.

Choose the parameter u in the Zeno configuration so that πr2 = 1 / n, i.e., [formula]. Then the area of the small balls is πu2 = 1 / (n32k). We analyze the probability that a Zeno configuration of length k = c( log n)1 / 2 centered at xi occurs in a set, V, of n i.u.d. points [formula] in 2. Let Zi denote the event "V contains a Zeno configuration centered at xi." Then we have

[formula]

for k = ((α / 2)( log 3n))1 / 2, where α is a free parameter in the range

[formula]

Discussion

Summary.

This paper gives new bounds on the maximum interference for graphs defined by points randomly distributed d. Minimum spanning trees have interference Θ(( log n)1 / 2), but better graphs exist; a strategy based on bucketing yields a graph with interference O(( log n)1 / 3). No graph on such a point set has interference o(( log n)1 / 4).

Open Problem.

An obvious open problem is that of closing the gap between the upper bound of O(( log n)1 / 3) and the lower bound of Ω(( log n)1 / 4. One strategy to achieve this would be to prove the following conjecture, which has nothing to do with probability theory:

For any [formula], [formula].

A weaker version of this conjecture is due to Halldórsson and Tokuyama [\cite=ht08], who conjecture that [formula] where D is the ratio of the lengths of the longest and the shortest edges of [formula].

Unit Disk Graphs.

Several of the references consider interference in the unit disk graph model, in which the graph G is constrained to use edges of maximum length r(n). It is straightforward to verify that all of the proofs in this paper continue to hold in this model, when [formula]. This is not an unreasonable condition; for i.u.d. points in d, it is known that [formula] is a necessary condition to be able to form a connected graph G [\cite=p97].

Locally Computable Graphs.

Khabbazian, Durocher, and Haghnegahdar [\cite=kdh11] give a local algorithm, called LocalRadiusReduction, that is run at the nodes of a communication graph, G = (V,E), and that reduces the number of edges of G. The resulting graph G' comes from a class of graphs that they denote as T(V). The class T(V) includes the minimum spanning tree of V and the graphs in this class share many of the same properties as the minimum spanning tree. In particular, the following result can be obtained by using the proof of Part 1 and properties of the family T(V) [\cite=kdh11].

Let V be a set of n independently and uniformly distributed points in d and let G be any graph in T(V). With high probability, [formula], where [formula] is the length of the longest edge in G.

In particular, implies that running the LocalRadiusReduction algorithm at the nodes of a unit disk graph with unit [formula] yields a connected graph with maximum interference O(( log n)1 / 2).
