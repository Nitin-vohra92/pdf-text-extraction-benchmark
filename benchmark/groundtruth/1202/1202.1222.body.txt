Introduction and statement of the main theorems

We consider solutions to the equation

[formula]

satisfying

[formula]

with particular emphasis on the role played by V.

Geometrically, if u solves [\eqref=eq0] and [\eqref=area], then the conformal metric gu: = e2u|dx|2 has Q-curvature [formula] and volume V (by |dx|2 we denote the Euclidean metric). For the definition of Q-curvature and related remarks, we refer to Chapter 4 in [\cite=cha] or to [\cite=FG] and [\cite=FH]. Notice that given a solution u to [\eqref=eq0] and λ > 0, the function [formula] solves

[formula]

hence there is no loss of generality in the particular choice of the constant (2m - 1)! in [\eqref=eq0]. On the other hand this constant has the advantage of being the Q-curvature of the round sphere S2m. This implies that the function [formula], which satisfies e2u1|dx|2 = (π- 1)*gS2m (here [formula] is the stereographic projection) is a solution to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] with [formula]. Translations and dilations (i.e. Möbius transformations) actually give us a large family of solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] with [formula], namely

[formula]

We shall call the functions ux0,λ standard or spherical solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area].

The question whether the family of spherical solutions in [\eqref=stand] exhausts the set of solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] has raised a lot of interest and is by now well understood. W. Chen and C. Li [\cite=CL] proved that on [formula] (m = 1) every solution to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] is spherical, while for every m > 1, i.e. in dimension 4 and higher, it was proven by A. Chang and W-X. Chen [\cite=CC] that Problem [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] admits solutions which are non spherical. In fact they proved

Theorem A (A. Chang-W-X. Chen [\cite=CC] 2001). For every m > 1 and [formula] there exists a solution to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area].

Several authors have tried to classify spherical solutions or, in other words, to give analytical and geometric conditions under which a solution to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] is spherical (see [\cite=CY], [\cite=WX], [\cite=Xu]), and to understand some properties of non-spherical solutions, such as their asymptotic behavior, their volume and their symmetry (see [\cite=Lin], [\cite=mar1], [\cite=WY]). In particular C-S. Lin proved:

Theorem B (C-S. Lin [\cite=Lin] 1998). Let u solve [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] with m = 2. Then either u is spherical (i.e. as in [\eqref=stand]) or [formula]

Both spherical solutions and the solutions given by Theorem A are radially symmetric (i.e. of the form u(|x - x0|) for some [formula]). On the other hand there also exist plenty of non-radial solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] when m = 2.

Theorem C (J. Wei and D. Ye [\cite=WY] 2006). For every [formula] there exist (several) non-radial solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] for m = 2.

Remark D Probably the proof of Theorem C can be extended to higher dimension 2m  ≥  2, yielding several non-symmetric solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] for every [formula], but failing to produce non-symmetric solutions for [formula]. As in the proof of Theorem A, the condition [formula] plays a crucial role.

Theorems A, B, C and Remark D strongly suggest that also in dimension 6 and higher all non-spherical solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] satisfy [formula], i.e. [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] has no solution for [formula] and the only solutions with [formula] are the spherical ones. Quite surprisingly we found out that this is not at all the case. In fact in dimension 6 we found solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] with arbitrarily large V:

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=trm0] we will consider only rotationally symmetric solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area], so that [\eqref=eq0] reduces to and ODE. Precisely, given [formula] let u = ua,b(r) be the solution of

[formula]

Here and in the following we will always (by a little abuse of notation) see a rotationally symmetric function f both as a function of one variable r∈[null] there is a non-spherical solution u to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area], i.e. there exists a metric on [formula] of the form gu = e2u|dx|2 satisfying [formula] and [formula]

The condition m  ≥  3 odd is (at least in part) necessary in view of Theorem B and [\cite=CL], but the case m  ≥  4 even is open. Notice also that when m = 3, Theorems [\ref=trm0] and [\ref=trm3] guarantee the existence of solutions to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] for

[formula]

Q -(2m-1)!,   (g)=V.

Δ u(r)=(2m-1)! e,

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=trm1]

Set [formula] and let Br denote the unit ball in [formula] centered at the origin. Given a smooth radial function f = f(r) in [formula] we will often use the divergence theorem in the form

[formula]

Dividing by ω2m - 1r2m - 1 into [\eqref=div1] and integrating we also obtain

[formula]

When no confusion can arise we will simply write u instead of ua,3 or ua,b to denote the solution to [\eqref=ODE]. In what follows, also other quantities (e.g. R, r0, r1, r2, r3, φ, ξ1, ξ2) will depend on a and b, but this dependence will be omitted from the notation.

Given any [formula], the solution u to the ODE [\eqref=ODE] exists for all times.

Applying [\eqref=div2] to f = Δ2u, and observing that Δ(Δ2u) =  - e6u  ≤  0 we get

[formula]

i.e. Δ2u(r) is monotone decreasing. This and [\eqref=div2] applied to Δu yield

[formula]

A further application of [\eqref=div2] to u finally gives

[formula]

Similar lower bounds can be obtained by observing that - e6u  ≥   - 1 for u  ≤  0. This proves that u(r) cannot blow-up in finite time and, by standard ODE theory, u(r) exists for every r  ≥  0.

Proof of [\eqref=lima] (completed). Fix b = 3 and take a < 0. The function [formula] vanishes for [formula]. In order to prove [\eqref=lima] we shall investigate the behavior of u in a neighborhood of R. The heuristic idea is that

Two useful lemmas

We now state and prove two lemmas used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=trm1].

For [formula], a  ≤  0, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Patiently differentiating, using that [formula], one sees that

[formula]

Using that φ(0) = 0 it is also easy to see that ξ1(0) = 0.

Since ξ2(0) is not defined, we will compute the limit of ξ2(r) as r  →  0. We first compute the Taylor expansions

[formula]

and

[formula]

with errors o(1)  →  0 as r  →  0. Then with o(1)  →  0 as r  →  0. Hence lim r  →  0ξ2(r) = 0.

We have

[formula]

Clearly [\eqref=eqint] is equivalent to

[formula]

Integrating by parts we get for r  ≥  2

[formula]

Another integration by parts yields

[formula]

where we used that the function t- 4et2 is increasing on

[formula]

0≤ dt≤ dt= (r-2).

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=trm0]

We start with the following lemma.

Set

[formula]

where u = ua,3 is the solution to [\eqref=ODE] for given a < 0 and b = 3. Then there exists a* < 0 such that V is continuous on (  -    ∞  ,a*].

It follows from [\eqref=stima8] and the monotonicity of Δ2u that we can fix - a* so large that

[formula]

Fix now ε > 0. Given a  ≤  a* it is not difficult to find ra > 0 and B = B(a) < 0 such that

[formula]

and, possibly choosing ra larger, using [\eqref=div1]-[\eqref=div2] as already done in the proof of Theorem [\ref=trm1], we get

[formula]

By possibly choosing ra even larger we can also assume that

[formula]

By ODE theory the solution ua,3 to [\eqref=ODE] is continuous with respect to a in [formula] for every k  ≥  0, in the sense that for any r' > 0, ua',3  →  ua,3 in Ck(Br') as a'  →  a. In particular we can find δ > 0 (depending on ε) such that if |a - a'| < δ then [\eqref=ra0]-[\eqref=ra] with a replaced by a' are still satisfied for r = ra (not ra') and [\eqref=ra0] holds also for every r > ra since Δ2ua',3(r) is decreasing in r (see [\eqref=stima11]). Then, with [\eqref=div1]-[\eqref=div2] we can also get the bounds in [\eqref=ra] for every r  ≥  ra (and ua',3 instead of ua,3). For instance Furthermore, up to taking δ > 0 even smaller, we can assume that

[formula]

Finally, the last bound in [\eqref=ra] and [\eqref=stima9] imply at once

[formula]

which together with [\eqref=stima10] completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=trm0] (completed). Set V* = V(a*), where a* is given by Lemma [\ref=cont]. By Lemma [\ref=cont], Theorem [\ref=trm1] and the intermediate value theorem, for every V  ≥  V* there exists a  ≤  a* such that

[formula]

hence the metric gua,3  =  e2ua,3|dx|2 has constant Q-curvature equal to 1 and [formula]. Applying the transformation

[formula]

it follows at once that the metric gu = e2u|dx|2 satisfies [formula] and [formula], hence u solves [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area]. [formula]

Proof of Theorems [\ref=trm3] and [\ref=trm4]

When [formula] is radially symmetric we have [formula]. In particular we have

[formula]

For m  ≥  2 and b  ≤  0 let ub solve

[formula]

From [\eqref=div1]-[\eqref=div2] it follows that u0  ≤  0, hence Δmu0  ≥   - (2m - 1)!. We claim that

[formula]

Indeed according to [\eqref=lapl] ψ solves

[formula]

and

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

see [\cite=mar1]. Then the claim follows from [\eqref=div1]-[\eqref=div2] and a simple induction.

Now integrating we get Using the formulas

[formula]

we verify

[formula]

hence by induction

[formula]

With the same argument used to prove Lemma [\ref=cont] we can show that the function

[formula]

is finite and continuous. Indeed it is enough to replace [\eqref=ra0] with

[formula]

and [\eqref=ra] with

[formula]

where rb is chosen large enough and

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Moreover, using that Δm - 1ub(0) = Cmb for some constant Cm > 0, Δmub(r)  ≤  0 for r  ≥  0 and [\eqref=div1]-[\eqref=div2] as before, we easily obtain

[formula]

where Em: = CmCm,m - 1 > 0, hence

[formula]

By continuity we conclude that for every V∈(0,Vm] there exists b  ≤  0 such that u = ub solves [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] if m is odd or [\eqref=eq0-]-[\eqref=area] if m is even. Taking [\eqref=Vm] into account it only remains to prove that the solutions ub corresponding to [formula] is not a spherical one. This follows immediately from [\eqref=ub], which is not compatible with [\eqref=stand]. [formula]

Applications and open questions

Possible gap phenomenon

Theorems [\ref=trm0] and [\ref=trm3] guarantee that for m = 3 there exists a solution to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] for every [formula] one can found a sequence (uk) of solutions to [\eqref=eq1]-[\eqref=Vk] with Q0 > 0 and

[formula]

For m = 2 this was made very precise by F. Robert [\cite=rob1] in the radially symmetric case. In higher dimension or when Q0 is not necessarily positive, thanks to Theorems [\ref=trm0]-[\ref=trm4] we see that α can take values larger than [formula]. Indeed if u is a solution to [\eqref=eq0]-[\eqref=area] or [\eqref=eq0-]-[\eqref=area], then uk: = u(kx) +  log k satisfies [\eqref=eq1]-[\eqref=Vk] with [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

When m = 2, Q0 > 0 (say [formula]) it is unclear whether one could have concentration points carrying more Q-curvature than [formula], i.e. whether one can take [formula] in [\eqref=alpha]. Theorem B suggests that if the answer is affirmative, this should be due to the convergence to the same blow-up point of two or more blow-ups. Such a phenomenon is unknown in dimension 4 and higher, but was shown in dimension 2 by Wang [\cite=wan] with a technique which, based on the abundance of conformal transformations of [formula] into itself, does not extend to higher dimensions.
