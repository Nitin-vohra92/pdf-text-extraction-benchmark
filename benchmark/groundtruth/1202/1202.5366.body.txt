Quantum Monte-Carlo study of magnetic ordering in ZnV2O4

Introduction

Interacting electrons in crystals exhibit a variety of cooperative phenomena. This is particularly evident for Mott insulators whose valence electrons are localized due to a rather strong intra-orbital Coulomb repulsion. The degree of electronic localization is controlled by the ratio U / t, where t is the dominant transfer integral between different atomic orbitals. The strong (U / t  ≫  1) and weak-localization ([formula]) regimes can be treated by expanding in the small parameters t / U or U / t. Unfortunately, this is not true for the intermediate-coupling regime ([formula]) because of the lack of small parameter. Therefore, it is very important to develop controlled and unbiased numerical techniques that can address this elusive regime. The main obstacle for Monte Carlo simulations is the sign problem that can arise from the fermionic statistics of the electronic degrees of freedom or the frustrated nature of the Hamitonian terms.

In this paper, we focus on the Vanadium spinels A2 +V3 +2O2 -4, a class of highly frustrated Mott insulators that belong to the intermediate-coupling regime. These systems comprise a pyrochlore lattice (corner sharing tetrahedra) of V3 + ions (see Fig. [\ref=fig:znv2o4](a)). Each V3 + ion has two in 3-d electrons in the t2g orbitals, while the O2 - and Zn2 + ions are in closed shell configurations. Consequently, the low-energy electronic spectrum consists of spin and orbital excitations that arise from the localized 3-d electrons in the V3 + ions.

The lattice symmetry of AV2O4 is cubic ([formula]m) at high temperatures. The crystal field produced by the octahedral coordination of O2 - ions splits the V3 + 3d-orbitals into high-energy eg and low-energy t2g orbitals. ZnV2O4 undergoes a structural cubic to tetragonal (I41 / amd) transition at [formula](K) [\cite=ueda1997] [\cite=vasiliev2006]. This structural transition causes further crystal field splitting of the t2g orbitals into xy-orbital and yz,zx-orbitals. (See Fig.[\ref=fig:znv2o4](c).) A magnetic transition to up-up-down-down magnetic ordering (uudd-MO) occurs at a lower temperature TN = 31  ~  40(K) [\cite=ueda1997] [\cite=vasiliev2006]. The magnetic ordering has a period of 4 lattice sites ([formula]) for chains oriented along the yz [formula] and zx [formula] directions. The origin of the uudd-MO and the lack of orbital ordering in this material have been an open this magnetic ordering was originally reported in 1973 [\cite=niziol1973]. More recent measurements of the pressure dependence of TN in different spinel vanadates [\cite=Blanco-Canosa07] indicate that ZnV2O4 belongs to the intermediate-coupling regime: TN decreases with pressure instead of increasing according to the Bloch's law [\cite=Bloch66] that is expected for the strong-coupling regime. Previous attempts at explaining these properties were based on strong-coupling [\cite=tsunetsugu2003] [\cite=motome2004] [\cite=tchernyshyov2004] [\cite=maitra2007] or weak-coupling expansions [\cite=chern2011] whose validity is not guaranteed for the intermediate-coupling regime relevant for ZnV2O4.

Three-band Hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice

The three-band Hubbard model relevant for the family of spinel vandates AV2O4 is

[formula]

where the operator d†ασr an electron of spin σ in the orbital α of the V3 + ion with coordinates r, nασr = d†ασrdασr, and [formula], where σδ are the Pauli matrices. tα is the transfer integral between α-orbitals of nearest-neighbor V3 + ions, U is the intra-orbital Coulomb repulsion, J is Hund's coupling, μα is the chemical potential whose orbital dependence is a consequence of the crystal field splitting induced by the structural transition, μyz  =  μzx  =  μxy  -  Δ, and [formula] represents summation over all pairs of the nearest-neighbor sites connected by α-type bonds. (As shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:znv2o4](b), the pyrochlore lattice has three types of bonds: xy, yz, and zx.) This implies that electrons occupying an α-orbital can only move along the single chain of α-type bonds that contains such orbital. Note that the on-site interaction term has only two independent parameters, U and J, because of the rotational symmetry of the single-ion Hamiltonian [\cite=dagotto2001].

By expanding around the strong-coupling limit of H3BH, Tsunetsugu and Motome derived an effective Kugel-Komuskii Hamiltonian whose ground state exhibits anti-ferro layered orbital ordering (OO) [\cite=tsunetsugu2003]. Moreover, by adding an antiferromagnetic exchange between third-nearest-neighbor spins, they showed that an uudd-MO is stabilized and coexists with the OO [\cite=motome2004]. Since the OO has not been observed in any member of the AV2O4 family, Tchernyshyov and Maitra-Valentí proposed alternative orbital orderings [\cite=tchernyshyov2004] [\cite=maitra2007]. On the other hand, by starting from the opposite weak-coupling limit, Chern and Batista derived uudd-MO without any orbital ordering by using a mean-field theory [\cite=chern2011]. In this paper, we show that our unbiased approach not only explains the observed magnetic ordering but also the lack of the OO in the intermediate coupling-regime relevant for the vanadium spinels.

Quantum Monte-Carlo methods for the simulation of fermionic Hamiltonians such as H3BH typically suffer from the well-known negative sign problem introduced by the fermionic statistics and by certain off-diagonal terms. To avoid the negative sign problem we replace Heisenberg-like Hund's interaction (fifth term in Eq. ([\ref=eq:3BH])) by an Ising-like term because. In doing so, we are assuming that the optimal magnetic ordering of H3BH is always collinear. In addition, we eliminate the hopping of singlet pairs between different orbitals of the same atom (sixth term in Eq. ([\ref=eq:3BH])) by assuming that the probability of double occupancy of a given orbital remains rather low in the intermediate-coupling regime. The resulting Hamiltonian,

[formula]

has only diagonal on-site interactions. Since all electrons are restricted to move along one-dimensional chains, there is no fermionic sign problem (fermions cannot be exchanged) and the only remaining challenge for efficient simulations is the the presence of geometric frustration.

Method

We apply the world-line quantum Monte-Carlo method (QMC) [\cite=kawashima2004] to the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:model]). We use a modified directed-loop algorithm for the updating procedure [\cite=kato2009]. In this algorithm, we insert a pair of discontinuities to the world-line configuration in (d + 1)-dimensional space, and move one of them stochastically by updating the world-line configuration. When the discontinuity comes back to the creation point where the other discontinuity is located, these discontinuities annihilate each other. Although the Hamiltonian ([\ref=eq:model]) does not cause any negative sign problem, the geometrically frustrated nature of the underlying lattice generates a "freezing problem" at low temperatures. To solve this problem, we introduce both thermal and quantum annealing in our QMC simulations. In the thermal annealing process, we start from an inverse temperature βinit and add δβ every Nann Monte-Carlo sweeps. We choose βinit = 1.0(eV- 1), Nann = 300, and δβ = (β  -  βinit) / (Nchange - 1) so that the inverse temperature is β after Nchange temperature changes. Because of the rather strong interaction between electrons, the discontinuity is often geometrically trapped and localized. To avoid this "freezing of the simulation", we apply a quantum annealing technique. We add a new term,

[formula]

to H to liberate the trapped discontinuity. We use the re-weighting technique to calculate the physical quantities of H from the simulation with H  +  Hq. The procedure is rather simple. We sample the world-line configurations only without any vertices corresponding to Hq. We choose q as qβ = 0.002  ≪  1 so that we can sample  90% of world line configurations.

We define the unit cell of the pyrochlore lattice as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:znv2o4](c). The primitive vectors are a1  =  (1 / 2,1 / 2,0), a2 = (1 / 2,0,1 / 2), and a3 = (0,1 / 2,1 / 2). Each unit cell is labeled by [formula] (ni is integer). The coordinates of the four ions in the unit cell are e1  =  (1 / 4,0,0), e2 = (0,1 / 4,0), e3 = (0,0,1 / 4), and e4 = (1 / 4,1 / 4,1 / 4). To reveal the existence of uudd-MO and estimate the magnetic transition temperature, we calculate the susceptibility

[formula]

where

[formula]

L(1,2)R is the order parameter for uudd-MO, i.e., 〈L(1)R〉 or 〈L(2)R〉 is finite in uudd-MO.

Results

We use U = 3.9 (eV), and J = 0.8 (eV) close to the previous theoretical works [\cite=tsunetsugu2003] [\cite=maitra2007] [\cite=pardo2008]. (t is estimated as 0.35(eV) [\cite=takubo2006].) Since we are focusing on the magnetic order transition, we assume that the crystal has tetragonal symmetry: Δ > 0. For concreteness, we use μxy = 3.05 (eV) and Δ = 1.0 (eV) so that one electron occupies xy orbital and the other electron occupies the yz or zx orbitals at low temperatures. Figure [\ref=fig:qmc] shows the results of our QMC simulations at t = 0.8 (eV). The finite size scaling of χsL- 2 + η has a crossing point at [formula] (eV) where the specific heat curves have a peak. Figure [\ref=fig:phasediagram] shows five transition temperatures estimated by using the same finite-size scaling analysis.

Discussions and Conclusions

The transition temperature changes non-monotonically as a function of t. By calculating

[formula]

where [formula], we have also confirmed the OO proposed by Tsunetsugu-Motome type does not appear for the range of parameters shown in Figure [\ref=fig:phasediagram]. This result is qualitatively consistent with the above mentioned experimental observations. On the other hand, the magnitude of TN is much higher than the observed values, but it drops very rapidly for smaller values of t / U. The natural question is if the OO is still absent for values of t / U such that TN becomes comparable to the experimental values. An answer to this question requires of very low-temperature simulations for which the freezing problem becomes more challenging. It is important to note that the rather high value of Δ that we used for our simulations tends to increase TN because of the localization of a single electron (S = 1 / 2) in the xy-orbital. We are also ignoring the π-bond hopping of electrons that can reduce further the magnitude of TN. Takubo et.al estimated the amplitude of π hopping is half of t [\cite=takubo2006].

In summary, we obtained the observed uudd-MO without OO for the intermediate-coupling regime of the three-band Hubbard model by using QMC simulations complemented by thermal and quantum annealing techniques. Preliminary results for t = 0.3 (eV) (not shown in this paper) are also confirming the existence of the OO proposed by Tsunetsugu and Motome [\cite=tsunetsugu2003]. A complete the phase diagram that includes to the transition to the strong-coupling regime will be presented in a future work.
