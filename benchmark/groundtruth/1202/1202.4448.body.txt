Discovering Gluino Events at LHC-8 via Disappearing Chargino Tracks

Introduction

In recent years it has been increasingly recognized that there is strong motivation for scalar superpartners (squarks, etc) to be very heavy. Most recently it has been shown that compactified string/M-theories generically have scalars with masses equal to the gravitino mass, which in turn must be larger than about 30 TeV to avoid serious moduli and gravitino cosmological problems [\cite=Acharya2007] [\cite=Acharya2008] [\cite=Acharya2010]. On the phenomenological side earlier arguments include the "focus point" ones [\cite=Chan1997] [\cite=Feng1999a] [\cite=Feng1999b]," PeV supersymmetry" [\cite=Wells2004], a flavor motivated approach [\cite=Cohen:1996vb], anomaly mediation motivated heavy scalars [\cite=Ibe2006] [\cite=Asai2007] [\cite=Kadota2011], and "split supersymmetry" [\cite=ArkaniHamed2004] [\cite=ArkaniHamed2004b], which argues for turning hierarchy and naturalness problems into virtues and puts scalar masses at superhigh scales "as high as 1013 GeV".

The string/M-theory case necessarily includes the soft-breaking scalar masses mHu,mHd being heavy at the compactification scale. Then the supersymmetric two-doublet Higgs sector has heavy Higgs bosons plus a light Higgs boson whose mass can be calculated for solutions which have a Higgs mechanism. This led to the prediction [formula] GeV for [formula] [\cite=gordytalk] [\cite=Kane2011higgs], and the result that the observed light Higgs boson should be closely SM-like. These successful predictions significantly strengthen the motivation for heavy scalars (too heavy to be observed at LHC). Gauginos especially gluinos should be observable at LHC[\cite=Feldman:2010uv] [\cite=Izaguirre:2010nj] [\cite=Giudice:2010wb] [\cite=Alves:2010za] [\cite=Chen:2010kq] [\cite=Kane2011top]. Such theories also typically have a wino-like LSP.

For wino-like LSPs the chargino and the LSP are nearly degenerate [\cite=Randall:1998uk], separated only by quantum corrections. Then the chargino dominantly decays to the LSP plus a single soft charged pion (or lepton)[\cite=Wells1998], and travels a mean distance ~  10 cm from production, with a significant number of charginos giving a stiff charged massive-particle track that travels tens of centimeters. This property has recently been emphasized by [\cite=Cui] and by [\cite=Moroi2011] [\cite=Ibe2012] in studying pair production of charginos at the LHC.

In this paper we point out that such long stiff chargino tracks will occur in half or more of all gluino decays, and provide a new method to detect gluinos in the theories described above. In such theories it should be possible to detect gluinos with 10-20 [formula] at LHC-8. Even in compactified string theories with scalars having masses in the tens of TeV, the gluinos themselves decay quickly in the beam pipe and this method is applicable. It is also easy to get an approximate measurement of the gluino mass and cross section, and therefore of the gluino spin[\cite=Kane2008]. Measuring the spin provides a crucial check that the produced object is indeed a spin 1/2 partner of the colored gluon, and helps confirm that nature is indeed supersymmetric.

In the following we give detailed numbers to document the above. What can actually be done is very detector dependent, so our results are necessarily approximate and require better analyses which will hopefully be performed with the actual data. One can obtain an approximate measure of the LSP mass from just the kinematics and variables such as MEff . Using information on the chargino tracks and their curvature and possible information on the soft charged pion (or the soft leptons) from the chargino decay can sharpen results on the chargino mass and therefore the nearly degenerate LSP mass. In this paper we focus on the well motivated theories, with heavy scalars and wino-LSPs. Purely phenomenologically the method would also work for gluino (or squark) searches in any model with chargino and LSP degenerate within less than 2mπ

Searching for Gluino Events with [formula] Tracks

Charged tracks resulting from long lived pair produced charginos can provide an unambiguous SUSY signal in particle colliders[\cite=Feng1999] [\cite=Moroi1999] [\cite=Ibe2006] [\cite=Asai2007] [\cite=Asai2008]. Assuming the Higgsino mass parameter [formula] TeV as is natural in theories with heavy gravitinos, the charged and neutral Wino masses are essentially degenerate at tree level. The largely model independent mass splitting which results from loop corrections is δm  ~  160 MeV [\cite=Feng1999]. To a good approximation the charged Wino decay width can be given by the two body decay width for [formula][\cite=Ibe2006]:

[formula]

where θc is the Cabbibo and angle and the pion decay width fπ  ~  130 MeV. For large values of [formula] TeV and moderate values of tan β the loop contribution dominates the mass splitting, resulting in a charged Wino lifetime cτ  ~  O(5) cm [\cite=Feng1999].

A prolific source of detectable charged Wino tracks results from three body decays of pair produced gluinos, [formula] jets. In typical heavy squark and Wino LSP models, the gluino has a O(50%) branching ratio to [formula] final states; these events result in many hard objects, and are easily triggered on [\cite=Acharya2009] [\cite=Kane2011top]. The NLO gluino pair production cross section for the mass range of interest, [formula] GeV, is [formula]. Increasing the LHC center of mass energy from [formula] TeV to [formula] TeV approximately doubles the gluino production cross section (as calculated by PROSPINO[\cite=PROSPINO]). Thus with 10 [formula] of luminosity, we should already expect numerous gluino pair production events at LHC-8; roughly half of these gluinos will produce a charged Wino as a 3-body decay product, since the [formula] symmetry relates the branching ratio to [formula], [formula] and [formula].

In order to detect charged Winos resulting from gluino decays, [formula] must live long enough to form a track in the inner detector. Specifically, we focus on the detection capabilities of the ATLAS detector. In the barrel region, the inner detector of the ATLAS detector contains three layers of pixel detector at average radii of 5 cm, 9 cm, 12 cm, then there are four layers of semiconductor tracker (SCT), located respectively at 30 cm, 37 cm, 44 cm and 51 cm away from the beam line. The transition radiation tracker (TRT) is located outside the SCT, 55.4 cm away from the beam line [\cite=Aad:2008zzm]. If the charged Wino reaches the third layer of the SCT its track can be reconstructed using the information from the pixel detector and the SCT, and its three-momentum can be determined with good resolution [\cite=Asai2008bino]. Perhaps it will be possible to use shorter chargino tracks. The soft pion (or lepton) resulting from the chargino decay would also be a distinctive signal if it could be observed, and would give useful information regarding the kinematics of the event. To estimate the usefulness of looking for stiff charginos, we simulate decays of charged Winos resulting from gluino pair production. The pair produced gluino events are generated by the MadGraph 5/MadEvent package [\cite=MadGraph], and the gluino decays (as well as hadronization and showering) are implemented through PYTHIA6 [\cite=Sjostrand:2006za]. The mass splitting δm which enters into the decay width is calculated using SOFTSUSY [\cite=softsusy]. The results for [formula] GeV with 10 [formula] of LHC-8 data (without any kinematic cuts) are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. In Fig. 1, the charged Winos are binned as a function of transverse distance traveled before decay. Table 1 shows an inclusive count of the number charginos which make it past a given detector layer. These results indicate that with the 10 [formula] of LHC-8 data expected at the end of 2012, for [formula] GeV we expect [formula] charginos will make it past the third SCT layer.

To search for gluinos, one can use the usual SUSY search channels (or even looser cuts) to isolate relatively pure events from the gluino decay, and then search for chargino tracks in those events. For a concrete example, in the G2-MSSM (resulting from M-theory compactified on a G2 manifold [\cite=Acharya2008b]) the gluino has a substantial branching fraction to third generation quarks:   →  tW-  +  h.c.. As demonstrated in [\cite=Acharya2009] [\cite=Kane2011top], searching for events containing a lepton and multiple b-jets is the most powerful way to discover this kind of model. With the additional signals given by chargino tracks, one can also make use of the weaker SUSY search channels such as 1 lepton + 1 b-jet. As an example, we consider a G2-MSSM model with a 750 GeV gluino and 150 GeV Wino LSP with 10 [formula] of LHC-8 data. After applying cuts similar to the 1 lepton + 1 b-jet ATLAS search channel[\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2012-003]:

[formula]

about 200 gluino pair events survive. Roughly 10 of these surviving events will contain a long chargino track which can be reconstructed. Aside from the 1 lepton + 1 b-jet channel, this chargino signal can be observed in many other SUSY channels, as illustrated in Table 2. In this table, the kinematic cuts defining the signal regions of the 1 b-jet + [formula] channel are defined in [\cite=ATLAS-CONF-2012-003], and the cuts defining the signal regions of the jets + [formula] channel are defined in [\cite=ATLAS2011jets]. These results demonstrate that the signal of chargino tracks is robust under typical SUSY squark/gluino search cuts; in particular, increasing the meff cut from 500 GeV to 1000 GeV still maintains ~  60% of the chargino signal. Thus chargino tracks provide an additional "free" channel for gluino discovery, which can be studied without loosening cuts and introducing additional SM background events into the SUSY signal region.

The stub track resulting from chargino decay is a distinctive SUSY signal without SM background. However, in reality the signal may be contaminated by detector noise and mis-reconstructed tracks. We did not include these possible backgrounds in our study; instead we argue they can be controlled without significantly hurting the signals. First of all, the kinematic cuts we applied to remove a large amount of the SM background should also help reduce fake chargino tracks. Requiring pT  >  80 GeV for the chargino track candidate keeps ~  80% of the signal events, while eliminating detector noise resulting from soft mis-reconstructed tracks. For a fake track with high pT, the fake chargino pT will be nearly collinear with [formula] unless there are large contributions to [formula] from energetic neutrinos. Thus imposing a [formula] cut will reduce the background from hard jets faking chargino tracks, while keeping ~  60% of the signal events. In addition, the pixel detector can measure dE / dx energy loss of the particle. The charginos on average have βγ  =  2, while the SM tracks with the same momentum have much larger βγ. It is possible that this energy loss can be used to separate the real chargino tracks from the backgrounds. With enough events, dE / dx spectra can even be used to estimate the mass of the chargino. However, precise determination of the background after imposing cuts can only be determined by experimental detector groups upon analyzing the data.

Reconstructing the Gluino Mass

If chargino tracks are observed, one can use this additional information to separate SUSY events from the SM background, and estimate the mass of the gluino even without precise knowledge of the chargino mass. As already mentioned in the ATLAS jets + [formula] search, ignoring the chargino/LSP mass only changes the reconstructed gluino mass by a small amount, [formula]. To obtain sufficient statistics for the analysis, we use a set of cuts slightly looser than the cuts used in the ATLAS jets + [formula] search[\cite=ATLAS2011jets]:

[formula]

For 10 [formula] of LHC-8 data, there will be about 60 events containing a reconstructed chargino track which pass the cuts listed in (3). In order to find the pair of jets most likely to have come from the same gluino as the chargino track, we calculate the transverse momentum of the other chargino/neutralino from the missing transverse momentum, and separate the 6 objects (2 charginos and 4 jets) into 2 clusters, each containing 1 chargino and 2 jets. The optimal clustering is determined by minimizing the difference in |pT| between the two clusters. Using the cluster containing the real chargino track and assuming [formula], we can make a histogram of the reconstructed gluino mass. Fitting the histogram with a distribution gives a reconstructed gluino mass near the actual value, with [formula] GeV uncertainty. Thus chargino tracks can provide an independent kinematic measure of the gluino mass, whose accuracy will improve with improving statistics.

Simply knowing that a gluino of some approximately measured mass decays to a chargino + jets of some pT puts a valuable upper limit on the chargino mass (and therefore the dark matter mass). With more information, it may be possible to obtain a precise measurement of the chargino mass. For instance, measuring the pT of the soft pion resulting from the chargino decay along with the chargino track 3-momentum might allow a kinematic reconstruction of the chargino mass. However, it is unclear whether or not measuring such a soft track would be experimentally feasible. Other experimental approaches, such as determining the dE / dx spectra of the chargino tracks, can also refine measurements of the chargino mass.

Concluding Remarks

We have demonstrated that with the 10-20 [formula] of LHC-8 data expected by the end of 2012, it is possible to discover gluino pair production events by searching for disappearing chargino tracks from gluino decays which occur in (well-motivated) Wino-like LSP models, in which charginos are nearly degenerate with the LSP. This chargino signal is robust under the typical signal isolation cuts used in SUSY gluino searches, so searching for chargino tracks will enhance canonical SUSY searches for colored superpartners without decreasing signal significance by introducing additional background. Furthermore, measuring the 3-momentum of long lived charginos will give an independent measurement of the gluino mass, and even potentially the chargino/LSP mass. Measuring the gluino mass will allow for determination of the gluino spin once the production cross section is known, providing important verification that the gluino is indeed the supersymmetric partner of the gluon.
