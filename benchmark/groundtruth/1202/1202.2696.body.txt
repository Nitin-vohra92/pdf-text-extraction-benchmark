Introduction

A normal projective variety X is said to be of Fano type if there exists a boundary [formula]-divisor Δ on X such that (X,Δ) has klt singularities and - (KX  +  Δ) is ample. [\cite=bchm] proved that a [formula]-factorial variety of Fano type is a Mori dream space. Then [\cite=gost] proved that a [formula]-factorial variety of Fano type can be characterized as a Mori dream space whose Cox ring has at worst log terminal singularities. In [\cite=gost] they also considered the Calabi-Yau version and proved a similar result by assuming some conjecture (see [\cite=gost]). The conjecture has been partially verified in [\cite=ft], so that their statement is generalized in the corresponding cases [\cite=gost].

In this paper we give a conjecture-free proof to the Calabi-Yau version of the result. Namely, we verify the following theorem.

A normal projective variety X is said to be of Calabi-Yau type if (X,Δ) has log canonical singularities and KX  +  Δ is numerically trivial for some boundary [formula]-divisor Δ. Note that a variety of Calabi-Yau type is not necessarily a Mori dream space.

By slightly modifying the arguments, we can also reprove [\cite=gost] in Theorem [\ref=gost]. During the preparation of this paper, we received a preprint from Morgan Brown [\cite=b] in which he independently gave a different proof to the 'only if' directions of Theorem [\ref=characterization] and Theorem [\ref=gost].

We explain a little bit about the proof of Theorem [\ref=characterization]. For the 'only if' direction, we first take a set of [formula] ample divisors which are linearly independent in [formula], and take the affine space bundle [formula]. From a boundary [formula]-divisor Δ on X which makes the pair (X,Δ) log Calabi-Yau, we construct a boundary divisor ΔY on Y such that the pair (Y,ΔY) is also log canonical and KY  +  ΔY is [formula]-linearly trivial. By contracting the zero section of π, we obtain a birational morphism f:Y  →  Z such that (Z,ΔZ) is log canonical and KZ  +  ΔZ is [formula]-linearly trivial for some [formula]-divisor ΔZ. It turns out that there exists a small birational morphism from the spectrum of the Cox ring of X to Z. Thus we prove the log canonicity of the Cox ring.

In our proof of the 'if' direction of Theorem [\ref=characterization], we first derive the [formula]-effectivity of the anti-canonical divisor of X from the log canonicity of the Cox ring, by using a similar construction as above and applying the numerical characterization of the pseudo-effective divisors due to [\cite=bdpp] (for a Mori dream space, this result is much easier to prove; see Proposition [\ref=bdpp_for_Mori_dream_spaces]). Since X is assumed to be a Mori dream space, we can apply the anti-canonical MMP which terminates in a semi-ample model in the same way as in [\cite=gost]. By the standard facts from [\cite=hk], the semi-ample model is the quotient of an open subset of the spectrum of the Cox ring by the dual torus action of [formula]. We can assume that the action is free, so that the log canonicity descends to the quotient. Therefore the semi-ample model is of Calabi-Yau type. As demonstrated in [\cite=gost], we can trace back the anti-canonical MMP to prove that X itself is of Calabi-Yau type.

Throughout the paper, we work over a field k of characteristic zero.

Preliminaries

We start with the definitions of varieties of Fano type and Calabi-Yau type.

Next we give the definition of Mori dream spaces.

The following is one of the most important properties of Mori dream spaces.

Let X be a [formula]-factorial Mori dream space. Then for any divisor D on X, a D-MMP can be run and terminates.

The notion of multi-section rings and the Cox rings are repeatedly used in the studies of Mori dream spaces.

As seen above, the definition of Cox rings depends on the choice of the group Γ. We can prove that the ambiguity does not affect the basic properties of rings, such as finite generation, log terminality (log canonicity), etc. In fact, there is a canonical way to define Cox rings without ambiguity (up to isomorphisms) due to Hausen [\cite=hau]. We can check that the properties of rings mentioned above holds for his Cox ring if and only if ours has the same properties. Since our definition of Cox rings as multi-section rings is easier for calculation, we adopt our definition in this paper.

We need the following intersection-theoretic characterization of effective (resp. big) divisors on a Mori dream space.

Let D be a divisor on a Mori dream space X. Then X is [formula]-effective (resp. big) if and only if its intersection number with any curve in any covering family is at least (strictly greater than) zero.

Note that the [formula]-effectivity and the pseudo-effectivity are equivalent for divisors on a Mori dream space. It is enough to show the following statement.

Let X be a Mori dream space and D a not big but [formula]-effective (resp. not [formula]-effective) divisor on X. Then there exists a curve in a covering family C on X such that C  ·  D = 0 (resp. C  ·  D < 0).

We run a D-MMP

[formula]

so that the pushforward DN of D on XN is semi-ample (resp. there exists a DN-Mori fiber space from XN).

Note that all the birational maps above are surjective in codimension one. Therefore we can find an open subset U of XN whose complement has codimension at least two such that all the birational maps above are identities on U.

If D is not big (resp. not [formula]-effective), we take DN-Iitaka fiber space (resp. DN-Mori fiber space) f:XN  →  Y. Since the relative dimension of f is positive, there is a curve C' in a covering family which is contained in a fiber of f. Since [formula] has codimension at least two, we can choose C' so that it is contained in U. Now let C be the strict transform of C' on X. We see that this C has the desired properties.

The intersection theoretic characterization of pseudo-effective divisors was first proven in [\cite=bdpp]. On the other hand, the characterization of big divisors in Proposition [\ref=bdpp_for_Mori_dream_spaces] does not hold for an arbitrary variety. For example, it is known that there exists a strictly nef divisor on a smooth projective surface which is not [formula]-effective. See [\cite=har70].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=characterization]

Cox rings of Calabi-Yau Mori dream spaces

In this subsection, we prove the 'only if' direction of Theorem [\ref=characterization].

Choose ample line bundles [formula] on X which are linearly independent in [formula], where [formula]. Consider the following natural morphism

[formula]

where Γ' is the semi-group generated by the classes of Ai, and let π:Y  →  X to be the structure morphism. Since Ai are ample, f is a birational projective morphism which contracts the zero section of π, which we denote again by X (see [\cite=har66]).

If (X,Δ) is a log canonical pair, then it follows that

[formula]

is also a log canonical pair, where Ej  ⊂  Y is the divisor corresponding to the projection [formula]. Set [formula]. Then it holds that [formula]. Since the restriction map [formula] is bijective, this implies that KY  +  ΔY is [formula]-linearly trivial. Thus we see that KZ  +  ΔZ = f*(KY  +  ΔY) is also [formula]-linearly trivial, where ΔZ = f*ΔY. Hence we get the equality

[formula]

concluding that (Z,ΔZ) is a log canonical pair.

We shall derive the log canonicity of the Cox rings of X.

Set Γ  =  Γ' + ( - Γ'). Then the multi-section ring R(X,Γ) is a Cox ring of X. Consider the natural injective ring homomorphism

[formula]

The corresponding morphism

[formula]

is birational and contracts no divisor.

Choose an ample divisor A0 from the interior of the cone spanned by Γ'. Then for any positive integer m > 0 and a non-zero global section [formula], the natural ring homomorphism

[formula]

is an isomorphism.

By [\cite=hk], if we take two global sections s1 and s2 of mA0 such that the corresponding divisors on X have no common component, then {s1,s2}  ⊂  R(X,Γ) is a regular sequence. Therefore the divisors of s1 and s2 have no common irreducible components, and this concludes the proof.

From the claim above, we see that the pair [formula] is also log canonical, where Δ' is the effective [formula]-divisor naturally defined from ΔZ. Since [formula] is [formula]-factorial by [\cite=hk], we see that [formula] itself is log canonical.

Mori dream spaces with log canonical Cox rings

In this subsection we prove the 'if' direction of Theorem [\ref=characterization].

Since Z has only log canonical singularities, we can write [formula] such that ei  ≤  1 for all i. Then [formula] because X is mapped to a point by f. By the adjunction formula, we have [formula].

It follows that (KX  ·  C)  ≤  0. Since C was arbitrary, we conclude that - KX is [formula]-effective by Proposition [\ref=bdpp_for_Mori_dream_spaces].

Characterization of varieties of Fano type revisited

Using the similar arguments as above, we can reprove the characterization of varieties of Fano type (=  [\cite=gost]).

For 'only if' direction it is enough to prove that the Cox ring of X is log terminal, since the finite generation is proved in [\cite=bchm]. We only point out which part of the proof of Theorem [\ref=cox_ring_of_cy] should be modified.

Instead of thinking of the pair

[formula]

we should think of the following klt pair

[formula]

for some positive number ε < 1.

Then it holds that [formula], since we have OY(Ei)|X≃OX( - Ai). By replacing Ai from the beginning if necessary, we can assume that there exists ε such that [formula], so that [formula].

Therefore we get the equality

[formula]

as before, where ΔZ = f*ΔY. Hence the pair (Z,ΔZ) is klt. The rest of the proof is the same.

For the proof of the 'if' direction, we first prove that - KX is big. If we carry out the same arguments as in Step [\ref=non-vanishing] of the proof of Theorem [\ref=log_canonical_implies_log_Calabi-Yau], by the log terminality of the Cox ring we see that ei < 1 holds for all i. Since some positive linear combination of the Di is ample, we deduce that [formula]. Since X is a Mori dream space, this implies the bigness of - KX by Proposition [\ref=bdpp_for_Mori_dream_spaces].

Next, by arguing as in Step [\ref=after_non-vanishing], we arrive at a model XN such that - KXN is semi-ample and big. We can also show that XN is log terminal from the log terminality of the Cox ring, concluding that XN is of Fano type. The rest is the same.
