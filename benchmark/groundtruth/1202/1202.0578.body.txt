An index theorem on anti-self-dual orbifolds

Introduction

If (M4,g) is an oriented four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Hodge star operator associated to g acting on 2-forms is a mapping * :Λ2  ↦  Λ2 satisfying *  2  =  Id, and Λ2 admits a decomposition of the form

[formula]

where Λ2± are the ±  1 eigenspaces of [formula]. The Weyl tensor can be viewed as an operator Wg:Λ2  →  Λ2, and we define W±g  =  π±Wgπ±, where π± is the projection onto Λ2±.

Since Poon's example of a 1-parameter family of anti-self-dual metrics on [formula] [\cite=Poon], a large number of examples of anti-self-dual metrics on various four-manifolds have been found. We do not attempt to give a complete history here, and only mention following works [\cite=DonaldsonFriedman] [\cite=Floer] [\cite=Honda28] [\cite=Joyce1995] [\cite=KovalevSinger] [\cite=LeBrunJDG] [\cite=LeBrunSinger]. In this paper, we will be concerned with orbifold metrics in dimension four with isolated orbifold points:

Given a compact Riemannian orbifold (,ĝ) with non-negative scalar curvature, one can use the Green's function for the conformal Laplacian Gp to associate with any point p a non-compact scalar-flat orbifold by

[formula]

A coordinate system at infinity arises from using inverted normal coordinates in the metric g in a neighborhood of the point p, which gives rise to the following definition:

A complete Riemannian manifold (X4,g) is called or of order τ if there exists a finite subgroup [formula] acting freely on S3 and a diffeomorphism [formula] where K is a compact subset of X, and such that under this identification,

[formula]

for any partial derivative of order k, as r  →    ∞  , where ρ is the distance to some fixed basepoint.

By an of an ALE space (X,g), we mean choosing a conformal factor [formula] such that u  =  O(ρ- 2) as ρ  →    ∞  . The space (X,u2g) then compactifies to a C1,α orbifold. In the anti-self-dual case, there moreover exists a C∞-orbifold conformal compactification (X̂,ĝ) with positive Yamabe invariant [\cite=CLW]. So from the conformal perspective, anti-self-dual ALE spaces are the same as Riemannian orbifolds.

There are many interesting examples of anti-self-dual ALE spaces. Eguchi-Hanson discovered a Ricci-flat anti-self-dual metric on O( - 2) which is ALE with group [formula] at infinity [\cite=EguchiHanson]. Gibbons-Hawking then wrote down an metric ansatz depending on the choice of n monopole points in [formula], giving an anti-self-dual ALE hyperkähler metric with group [formula] at infinity, which are called multi-Eguchi-Hanson metrics [\cite=GibbonsHawking] [\cite=Hitchin2]. In 1989, Kronheimer then classified all hyperkähler ALE spaces in dimension 4, [\cite=Kronheimer] [\cite=Kronheimer2], which we will describe in Section [\ref=S1]. Using the Joyce construction from [\cite=Joyce1995], Calderbank and Singer wrote down many examples of toric ALE anti-self-dual metrics, which are moreover scalar-flat Kähler, and have cyclic groups [formula] at infinity contained in [formula] [\cite=CalderbankSinger].

Group actions

We will next consider the following subgroups of [formula]:

Type An,n  ≥  1: Γ the cyclic group [formula],

[formula]

acting on [formula], which is identified with [formula] via the map

[formula]

Writing a quaternion [formula] as α  +  β for [formula], we can also describe the action as generated by e2πi  /  n, acting on the left.

Type Dn,n  ≥  3: Γ the binary dihedral group [formula] of order 4(n - 2). This is generated by eπi  /  (n - 2) and [formula], both acting on the left.

Type [formula], the binary tetrahedral group of order 24, double cover of A(4).

Type [formula], the binary octohedral group of order 48, double cover of S(4).

Type [formula], the binary icosahedral group of order 120, double cover of A(5).

The "type" terminology arises from the relation with hyperkähler ALE spaces, which will be discussed in Section [\ref=S1]. Next, we have the notion of conjugate group actions:

When Γ is not a cyclic group, any two subgroups of [formula] which are isomorphic to Γ are in fact conjugate [\cite=MCC]. However, in the case of the cyclic group, there can be many conjugacy classes, and in this paper the only cyclic groups actions we consider are those conjugate to the An-type. Type D3 is in fact orientation-preserving conjugate to type A3.

We note the important fact that if (X,g) is an anti-self-dual ALE space with group Γ at infinity, then the conformal compactification (X̂,ĝ) with the anti-self-dual orientation has group Γ̃ at the orbifold point where Γ̃ is orientation-reversing conjugate to Γ.

Orbifold index theorems

Anti-self-dual metrics have a rich obstruction theory. If (M,g) is an anti-self-dual four-manifold, the deformation complex is given by

[formula]

where S20 denotes traceless symmetric tensors, Kg is the conformal Killing operator defined by

[formula]

with [formula], and D  =  (W+)g' is the linearized self-dual Weyl curvature operator.

For a compact smooth closed manifold, there is a formula for the index depending only upon topological quantities. Let us denote by

[formula]

where Hi(M,g) is the ith cohomology of the complex [\eqref=thecomplex], for i  =  0,1,2. For a compact anti-self-dual metric, we have

[formula]

where χ(M) is the Euler characteristic and τ(M) is the signature of M. This formula can be found written down in [\cite=KotschickKing], but was known to experts long before that paper.

Our first result is an index theorem for an anti-self-dual orbifold with a singularity conjugate to ADE-type:

Let (,ĝ) be a compact anti-self-dual orbifold with a single orbifold point p with orbifold group Γ. If Γ is orientation-reversing conjugate to type A1, then

[formula]

If Γ is orientation-reversing conjugate to type An with n  ≥  2, then

[formula]

If Γ is orientation-reversing conjugate to type D3, then

[formula]

If Γ is orientation-reversing conjugate to type Dn with n  ≥  4, or type En with n  =  6,7,8, then

[formula]

The next result is an index theorem for an anti-self-dual orbifold with a singularity conjugate to ADE-type:

Let (,ĝ) be a compact anti-self-dual orbifold with a single orbifold point p with orbifold group Γ orientation-preserving conjugate to type An with n  ≥  1, or Dn with n  ≥  3, or En with n  =  6,7,8. Then

[formula]

The proofs of Theorem [\ref=mainit2] and Theorem [\ref=mainit] use Kawasaki's orbifold index theorem [\cite=Kawasaki]. However, we do not compute the correction terms using representation theory, but instead use an analytic method to determine the correction terms using certain examples.

For simplicity, the above theorems are stated in the case of a single orbifold point. However, if there are several orbifold points each of the above types, then a similar formula holds, with the correction term simply the sum of the corresponding correction terms for each type of orbifold point.

LeBrun negative mass metrics

In [\cite=LeBrunnegative], LeBrun presented the first known examples of scalar-flat ALE spaces of negative mass, which gave counterexamples to extending the positive mass theorem to ALE spaces. We briefly describe these as follows. Define

[formula]

where r is a radial coordinate, and {σ1,σ2,σ3} is a left-invariant coframe on [formula], and A  =  n - 2, B  =  1  -  n. Redefine the radial coordinate to be r̂2  =  r2  -  1, and attach a [formula] at r̂  =  0. After taking a quotient by [formula], with action given by the diagonal action

[formula]

the metric then extends smoothly over the added [formula], is ALE at infinity, and is diffeomorphic to O( - n). The mass is computed to be - 4π2(n - 2), which is negative when n  >  2. These metrics are scalar-flat Kähler, and satisfy b2-  =  1,τ  =   - 1,χ  =  2.

Since the [formula]-action in [\eqref=u2c] is orientation-reversing conjugate to type An - 1 under the intertwining map [formula], a corollary of Theorem [\ref=mainit] is the following:

Let [formula] be a conformally compactified LeBrun metric. Then

[formula]

We briefly recall some details of moduli space theory [\cite=Itoh2] [\cite=KotschickKing] (these references deal with the case of smooth manifolds, but the proofs are easily generalized to the setting of orbifolds). Given an anti-self-dual metric g on a compact orbifold, there is a map Ψ:H1  →  H2, called the which is equivariant with respect to the action of H0, and the moduli space of anti-self-dual conformal structures near g is localy isomorphic to Ψ- 1(0)  /  H0. Therefore, if H2  =  0, the moduli space is locally isomorphic to H1  /  H0.

Our final result is about the moduli space of anti-self-dual metrics nearby the conformally compactified LeBrun negative mass metrics. The case n  =  1 is the Burns metric, which is conformal to Fubini-Study metric on [formula], and is rigid. The case n = 2 is the Eguchi-Hanson metric which is also rigid. But for n  ≥  4 these metrics are not rigid as anti-self-dual metrics:

For n  ≥  4, the dimension of the moduli space of anti-self-dual orbifold metrics near a LeBrun metric [formula] is at least 4n  -  12.

This is proved in Section [\ref=exps] using the above index theorems. It is easy to see that any sufficiently close deformed metric has positive orbifold Yamabe invariant, and thus there is an associated anti-self-dual ALE space [\cite=AB2] [\cite=ViaclovskyFourier]. Thus the above theorem could equivalently be stated in terms of the moduli of anti-self-dual ALE metrics near the ALE metric [formula].

To exactly determine the dimension of the moduli space near the LeBrun metrics, it would be necessary to explicitly compute the action of H0 on H1. This does not follow from the above index theorems, which is why we can only give a lower bound for the dimension of the moduli space.

Questions

We end the Introduction with some interesting questions:

The hyperkähler ALE spaces are anti-self-dual spaces with group actions of type An, Dn, E6, E7, and E8 contained in [formula]. The LeBrun negative mass metrics are examples of anti-self-dual ALE spaces with group orientation-reversing conjugate to type An. Are there in fact non-trivial examples of anti-self-dual ALE spaces with group at infinity conjugate to the Dn type for n  ≥  3, and to the types E6,E7 and E8?

The paper [\cite=PedersenPoonKSF] discusses some Kähler scalar-flat deformations of the LeBrun negative mass metrics. But there is no indication given there of the dimension of such deformations; it is not clear what free parameters there are in this family. Of the 4n - 12 dimensional family found above, how many of these are Kähler scalar-flat deformations?

What are the possible conformal automorphism groups of the metrics in the 4n - 12 dimensional family found above?

For the LeBrun negative mass metrics on O( - n), what is the local dimension of the moduli space of anti-self-dual ALE metrics for n  ≥  3? Is it equal to 4n - 12? Are there nontrivial deformations for n = 3?

Hyperkähler ALE spaces

The hyperkähler ALE spaces were classified in dimension 4 by Kronheimer [\cite=Kronheimer] [\cite=Kronheimer2]. These are anti-self-dual Ricci flat-ALE metrics of order 4, with groups at infinity of ADE-type described in the introduction. We write the three independent complex structures as I,J,K. Using the metric, these are identified with Kähler forms ωI,ωJ,ωK, which are parallel self-dual 2-forms. The cohomology of these spaces are generated by 2-spheres with self-intersection - 2, with intersection matrix given by the negative of the corresponding Cartan matrix. We summarize the above in Table [\ref=hktp].

We next have a proposition regarding infinitesimal deformations of hyperkähler ALE spaces. Notice that these spaces are anti-self-dual with the complex orientation.

Let (X,g) be a hyperkähler ALE space of type An for n  ≥  1, type Dn for n  ≥  3, or type En for n  =  6,7,8. For - 4  ≤  ε  <  0, let H1ε(X,g) denote the space of traceless symmetric 2-tensors h∈S20((T*X)) satisfying

[formula]

with h  =  O(ρε) as ρ  →    ∞  , where ρ is the distance to some fixed basepoint, and [formula] is the divergence. Then H1ε(X,g)  =  H1- 4(X,g), and using the isomorphism [formula], H1- 4(X,g) has a basis

[formula]

where [formula] is a basis of the space of L2 harmonic 2-forms. Consequently,

[formula]

We begin by observing that

[formula]

where Bg is the Bach tensor. The first identity is proved in [\cite=GV11] and the second identity is proved in [\cite=Itoh]. Consequently, h∈Ker(Bg') and δgh  =  0. In the traceless divergence-free gauge, Bg' is asymptotic to Δ2 as ρ  →    ∞  , so [\cite=AcheViaclovsky] implies that there is no O(ρ- 1) term in the asymptotic expansion of h and therefore h  =  O(ρ- 2) as ρ  →    ∞  . Integrating by parts, we have that ΔLh  =  0, and consequently, h is an infinitesimal Einstein deformation. It follows from [\cite=ct], that h  =  O(ρ- 4) as ρ  →    ∞  . We also see that if ΔLh  =  0 and δgh = 0 then D(h)  =  0. This shows that decaying infinitesimal Einstein deformations are equivalent to decaying infinitesimal anti-self-dual deformations on these spaces.

The identification of the kernel is then given by the argument in [\cite=Biquard2011]. Briefly, the operator ΔL acting on traceless divergence free tensors can be identified with the operator d-d*- where

[formula]

is the exterior derivative. Since Ω2+ has a basis of parallel sections {ωI,ωJ,ωK}, the proposition follows since the L2-cohomology H2(2)(X) is isomorphic to the usual cohomology H2(X) [\cite=CarronDuke].

We next write down the index on the conformal compactifications of the hyperkähler ALE spaces:

Let (X̂,ĝ) be the conformal compactification of a hyperkähler ALE space (X,g) with group Γ at infinity. If Γ is type A1, then

[formula]

If Γ of type An for n  ≥  2, then

[formula]

If Γ is of type D3, then

[formula]

If Γ is of type Dn with n  ≥  4, or En with n  =  6,7,8, then

[formula]

This will be proved in the following section.

Index comparison

We next have a proposition relating the index on an ALE space (X,g) and the index on the compactification (X̂,ĝ). We let {z} denote coordinates at infinity for (X,g), let ρ  =  |z|, let {x} denote coordinate at the orbifold point p of (X̂,ĝ), and let r  =  |x|. These satisfy z  =  x / |x|2 and ρ  =  r- 1. We write the metric as g  =  G2pĝ where Gp  =  O(r- 2) as x  →  0. Similarly to H1ε(X,g) defined in Proposition [\ref=hkprop], we define H2ε(X,g) to be the space of solutions of D*gZ  =  0 satisfying Z  =  O(ρε) as ρ  →    ∞  . We also let [formula] denote the dimension of the space of conformal Killing fields on [formula] with respect to the Euclidean metric.

Let (X,g) be an anti-self-dual ALE metric with group Γ at infinity, and let (X̂,ĝ) be the orbifold conformal compactification. Then for - 2  <  δ  <  0, we have

[formula]

Letting Dg denote the linearized self-dual Weyl curvature (viewed as a (1,3)-tensor), we have the conformal transformation formulas

[formula]

where   =  G- 2ph,

[formula]

where Ẑ  =  Z, and

[formula]

where   =  G- 2pω.

We note that elementary Fredholm theory shows that if (X̂,ĝ) is a compact anti-self-dual orbifold then the cohomology groups of the complex [\eqref=thecomplex] are isomorphic to the following:

[formula]

and

[formula]

We first claim that

[formula]

To see this, from [\cite=AcheViaclovsky2], if Z∈H2ε(X,g) for ε  <  0, then Z∈H2- 4(X,g). Using the formula

[formula]

the tensor Ẑ is then a bounded solution of D*ĝẐ  =  0 on [formula]. Since DĝD*ĝ is an elliptic fourth order operator with leading term Δ2, Ẑ extends to a smooth solution on all of X̂. Conversely, any bounded solution of D*ĝẐ  =  0 yields an element Z∈H2- 4(X,g) satisfying D*gZ = 0, and [\eqref=h2en] is proved.

Using the identity [\eqref=h2en], [\eqref=if1] is then equivalent to

[formula]

which we rewrite as

[formula]

We next claim that there is a surjection

[formula]

To define this mapping, if h∈H1δ(X,g) then h  =  O(ρ- 2) as ρ  →    ∞   by [\cite=AcheViaclovsky2]. From [\eqref=dchange], and the formula

[formula]

it follows that [formula] is a solution of Dĝ()  =  0 on [formula] satisfying   =  O(r2) as r  →  0. This implies that ∈C1,α(S20(T*X̂)), so δĝ()∈C0,α(T*X̂). Next, consider the operator [formula] mapping from

[formula]

This operator is elliptic and self adjoint, with kernel exactly the space of conformal Killing fields. Since δĝ() is orthogonal to this kernel, by Fredholm theory there exists a solution ∈C2,α(T*X̂) of the equation [formula]. We therefore have the decomposition

[formula]

with ∈C2,α(T*X̂) and 0∈C1,α(S20(T*X̂)) satisfying δ0  =  0. Since DĝKĝω  =  0, we have Dĝ0  =  0. As mentioned in the proof of Theorem [\ref=hkprop], D*ĝDĝ  =  B'ĝ, has leading term Δ2 in the traceless divergence-free gauge, so the singularity is removable and therefore 0∈H1(X̂,ĝ). The mapping F:h  ↦  0 is the required mapping in [\eqref=mapscp].

We claim that the map F is surjective. To see this, let 0 satisfy δĝ0  =  0 and Dĝ(0)  =  0. Then h0  =  G2p0 satisfies Dg(h0) = 0. From [formula] we have that h0  =  O(1) as ρ  →    ∞  , so δgh0  =  O(ρ- 1) as ρ  →    ∞  . Consider

[formula]

for ε  >  0 small, and where the spaces are weighted Hölder spaces (see [\cite=Bartnik]). The adjoint mapping has domain weight - 4  -  ( - 1  +  ε)  =   - 3  -  ε. An integration by parts shows that the kernel of the adjoint therefore consists of decaying conformal Killing fields, which are necessarily trivial. Consequently, the mapping in [\eqref=sqx] is surjective. So there exists a solution ω∈Ck,α1  +  ε(T*X) to the equation [formula]. Defining h̃0  =  h0  -  Kgω, we have Dg(h̃0)  =  0 and δg(h̃0) = 0, and therefore h̃0∈H1- 2  -  δ(X,g). Finally, we have that

[formula]

and therefore F(h̃0)  =  0.

We next identify the kernel of the map F. If 0  =  0, then h  =  Kĝ for some ∈C2,α(T*X̂). The transformation formula [\eqref=kconf] implies that h  =  Kg(ω), where ω  =  G2p. Since [formula] satisfies   =  O(1) as r  →  0, from the formula

[formula]

it follows that ω  =  O(ρ2) as ρ  →    ∞  . Since [formula], and [formula] is an elliptic operator, ω admits an asymptotic expansion at infinity with leading term a solution of [formula] in [formula]. To count these solutions, we use the relative index theorem of [\cite=LockhartMcowen], which says that for non-exceptional weights δ1  <  δ2,

[formula]

where N(δ1,δ2) counts the dimension of the space of homogeneous solutions in [formula] with growth rate between δ1 and δ2. It is easy to see that this implies the following. First,

[formula]

and [formula] is the dimension of the space of 1-forms with linear coefficients on [formula] which descend to [formula]. Finally, [formula] is the dimension of the space of 1-forms ω2 on [formula] with quadratic coefficients which descend to [formula] and which solve [formula].

Consequently, we have the following statements: Given any 1-form on [formula] with constant coefficients ω0, there is a unique solution of [formula] on (X,g) with ω  =  ω0  +  O(ρ- 1) as ρ  →    ∞  . Given any 1-form on [formula] with linear coefficients ω1, there is a unique solution of [formula] on (X,g) with ω  =  ω1  +  O(1) as ρ  →    ∞  . Finally, given any 1-form on [formula] with quadratic coefficients ω2 satisfying [formula], there is a unique solution of [formula] on (X,g) with ω  =  ω2  +  O(ρ) as ρ  →    ∞  .

However, since h is decaying and h  =  Kgω, the leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of ω must be a conformal Killing field in [formula]. If the group Γ  =  {e}, then there is a 15-dimensional space of such solutions. We are only interested in counting such solutions which do not extend to global conformal Killing fields on (X,g). Note that from [\eqref=kconf], conformal Killing fields on (X,g) correspond exactly to the conformal Killing fields on (X̂,ĝ), so the kernel of the map F is of dimension [formula]. Since F is surjective, the theorem follows in this case. If the group Γ is non-trivial, then the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of ω is of the form c1ρdρ  +  ω0, where ω0 is a rotational Killing field on [formula], for some constant c1. The dimension of the space of such leading terms is given by [formula]. Again, we are only interested in counting such solutions which do not extend to conformal Killing fields on (X,g), so the kernel of F is of dimension [formula], and the proof is complete.

Since these spaces are scalar-flat Kähler, from [\cite=AcheViaclovsky2] and [\cite=LeBrunMaskit], we have that dim (H2- 2  -  δ(X,g)) = 0. Consequently, Proposition [\ref=alelem] takes the form

[formula]

For type An, if n = 1, then [formula] (this is the dimension of the isometry group plus one for the radial scaling), so Propositions [\ref=hkprop] and [\ref=alelem] yield that

[formula]

If n  ≥  2, then from [\cite=MCC] we have [formula], so Propositions [\ref=hkprop] and [\ref=alelem] yield that

[formula]

For type D3, [\cite=MCC] we have [formula], so Propositions [\ref=hkprop] and [\ref=alelem] yield that

[formula]

For type Dn, m  ≥  4, and type En, n  =  6,7,8, from [\cite=MCC] we have [formula], so Propositions [\ref=hkprop] and [\ref=alelem] yield that

[formula]

Completion of proofs

In this section, we complete the proofs of the results stated in the Introduction.

From Kawasaki's orbifold index theorem [\cite=Kawasaki], it follows that there is an index formula of the form

[formula]

where NΓ' is a correction term depending only upon the oriented conjugacy class of the group action. The quantity χorb is the orbifold Euler characteristic defined by

[formula]

where W is the Weyl tensor, Ric is the Ricci tensor, and R is the scalar curvature. The quantity τorb is the orbifold signature defined by

[formula]

We have the orbifold signature formula

[formula]

where [formula] is the orbifold group at p and η(S3  /  Γ) is the η-invariant. The η-invariant for the ADE-type singularities is written down in [\cite=Nakajima], but we do not require this. The Gauss-Bonnet formula in this context is

[formula]

See [\cite=Hitchin] for a nice discussion of the formulas [\eqref=signature] and [\eqref=GB].

The quantity 15χorb()  +  29τorb() may then be written as follows

[formula]

Consequently, Kawasaki's formula [\eqref=kawa1] becomes

[formula]

where NΓ is a correction term depending only upon the oriented conjugacy class of the group action. The important point is that [\eqref=kawa2] holds on anti-self-dual orbifold with one singular point orientation-preserving conjugate to type Γ. Consequently, we can simply plug in the examples in Theorem [\ref=hypkthm] to determine the correction term.

If the orbifold point is of type A1, then from Table [\ref=hktp], χ(X)  =  2, so χ(X̂)  =  3, and τ(X̂)  =   - 1 (with the anti-self-dual orientation), so from Theorem [\ref=hypkthm] we have

[formula]

so NΓ  =   - 4.

If the orbifold point is type An for n  ≥  2, then from Table [\ref=hktp], χ(X̂)  =  n + 2, and τ(X̂)  =   - n, so from Theorem [\ref=hypkthm], we have

[formula]

which implies that NΓ  =  4n  -  10.

If the orbifold point is type D3, then from Table [\ref=hktp], χ(X̂)  =  5, and τ(X̂)  =   - 3, so from Theorem [\ref=hypkthm], we have

[formula]

which implies that NΓ  =  2.

Finally, if the orbifold point is of type Dn, n  ≥  4, or type En, n  =  6,7,8, again from Table [\ref=hktp] we have χ(X̂)  =  n + 2, and τ(X̂)  =   - n, so from Theorem [\ref=hypkthm], we have

[formula]

which implies that NΓ  =  4n  -  11.

If [formula] is a finite subgroup acting freely on S3, then we let Γ act on [formula] acting as rotations around the x5-axis. The quotient S4  /  Γ is an orbifold with two singular points, and the spherical metric gS descends to this orbifold. The north pole has orbifold group Γ, while the south pole has orbifold group Γ̃ orientation-reversing conjugate to Γ. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainit], and as mentioned in Remark [\ref=srmk], Kawasaki's formula yields

[formula]

It is easy to see that Ind(S4  /  Γ,gS)  =   dim (H0(S4  /  Γ,gS)), χ(S4  /  Γ) = 2, and that τ(S4  /  Γ)  =  0, so we have

[formula]

We first consider Γ of type An. We need only consider n  ≥  2 since n  =  1 is already covered in Theorem [\ref=mainit2] (the [formula]-action is orientation-reversing conjugate to itself). For n  >  1, [\eqref=kawa3] and Theorem [\ref=mainit2] yield

[formula]

which yields NΓ̃  =    -  4n.

For Γ of type D3, [\eqref=kawa3] and Theorem [\ref=mainit2] yield

[formula]

which yields NΓ̃  =   - 12 which is - 4n for n = 3.

For Γ of type Dn, n  ≥  4, or type En, n  =  6,7,8, we have

[formula]

which again yields NΓ̃  =    -  4n.

As mentioned in the Introduction, as an ALE space, the group at infinity of the metric [formula] is orientation-reversing conjugate to type An - 1. Consequently, the group at the orbifold point of [formula] is orientation-preserving conjugate to type An - 1. Theorem [\ref=mainit] yields the index

[formula]

Using that χ()  =  3 and τ()  =   - 1, [\eqref=lbind] follows.

Since [formula] is scalar-flat Kähler, by the same argument as given above in the proof of Theorem [\ref=hkprop], and [\eqref=h2en], we have that

[formula]

The conformal automorphism group of these metrics is [formula], which has real dimension 4, so Corollary [\ref=lbcor] implies that [formula]. From [\eqref=h20], as mentioned above in the Introduction, it follows that the moduli space is locally isomorphic to H1  /  H0. Finally, since H0 is of dimension 4, the moduli space therefore has dimension at least 4n  -  12.
