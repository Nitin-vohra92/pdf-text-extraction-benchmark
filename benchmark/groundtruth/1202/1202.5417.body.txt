Introduction

The ideas suggested and developed by B. Plotkin in the field of algebraic logic seem to be very interesting and efficient. It turns out that the geometrical notions and the geometrical intuition can be successfully applied in studying algebras from arbitrary varieties. Such approach leads to so called universal algebraic geometry and multi-sorted logical geometry.

The sketch of the ideas of universal algebraic geometry, problems and results can be found for example in [\cite=Plotkin_AG], [\cite=Plotkin_7Lec], [\cite=Plotkin_SomeResultsUAG], [\cite=PlotZitom_1], [\cite=PlotZitom_2]. The notions of logical geometry and obtained facts are presented in [\cite=PZ],[\cite=Plotkin_IsotAlg], [\cite=Plotkin].

The purpose of this paper is to consider only one but important notion of model theory, namely, the notion of type. The model theoretic notion of type is well known [\cite=MT]. Such a type is denoted in the paper by MT-type. MT-type is related to one-sorted logics. On the other hand, the ideas of universal logical geometry give rise to logically-geometric types (LG-types). This notion is related to multi-sorted logic [\cite=PZ],[\cite=Plotkin]. Some of the problems discussed in the literature are the following ones: how are connected algebraically two n-tuples in an algebra whose types coincide and what we can say about two algebras whose types coincide.

Let Θ be a variety of universal algebras of some signature and W(X) denote the free Θ-algebra over a set [formula]. In the universal algebraic geometry, the set An of all n-tuples in a Θ-algebra A is replaced by the set hom (W(X),A) which is called an n-dimensional affine space and whose elements are called points. Since a point μ∈ hom (W(X),A) is a map we can speak about its kernel. Along with this usual kernel, so called logical kernel of μ is defined. The notion of logical kernel of a point leads to the notion of LG-type of an algebra. All notions mentioned above are defined in Section [\ref=S_Prel].

Although the two kinds of types mentioned above are related to different languages we show that MT-types of two n-tuples coincide if and only if the logical kernels of the corresponding points coincide (Theorem [\ref=twoTypes]).

Then in Section [\ref=LPA] we consider so called logically perfect algebras. An algebra H is said to be logically perfect if for every its two n-tuples whose types coincide there exists an automorphism of H which sends one of these tuples to another. A sufficient condition for logically perfectness of free finitely generated algebras is given. The main result in this section is Theorem [\ref=three_log.perf].

The last Section [\ref=Iso] is devoted to algebras having the same type (isotyped algebras). It is proved (Theorem [\ref=IsoAbel]) that if two Abelian groups have the same type and one of them is finitely generated and free then these groups are isomorphic.

The obtained results solve some problems set in [\cite=Plotkin].

Preliminaries

Throughout this paper, Θ is a variety of universal algebras of some signature which determines the corresponding first-order language L with equality "[formula]" and the infinite set [formula] of variables. Let W(X) denote the free Θ-algebra generated by X  ⊂  X0. We consider finite subsets X  ⊂  X0 only and follow the conception suggested by B. Plotkin (see for example [\cite=Plotkin_AG], [\cite=Plotkin], [\cite=Plotkin_IsotAlg], [\cite=PZ]).

Let [formula] be a Θ-algebra with the domain M. Every n-tuple [formula] of elements of M determines a homomorphism [formula] where [formula], viz μ(xi) = ai for [formula]. And vice versa, every such homomorphism determines an n-tuple in M. Thus the set Mn can be identified with [formula] which is called an affine space and whose elements are called points. Considering the tuples in M as points in the corresponding affine space gives us new interesting opportunities.

First of all, the kernel of a point μ appears: Kerμ  =  {(w,w')|μ(w) = μ(w')}. It is useful to consider equalities [formula] instead of corresponding pairs in W(X). Such an approach leads to connections between sets of points and systems of identities, that is, to something like to algebraic geometry for an universal algebra. For details see papers cited above. In the present paper, we focus on the notion of so called logical kernel of a point μ: LKerμ. We recall the definition according to [\cite=Plotkin].

Let Γ denote the set of all finite subsets of X0. For every X∈Γ, consider the signature [formula], where MX is the set of all equalities [formula], where w,w'∈W(X). By adding for every X∈Γ symbols s = sXY:W(X)  →  W(Y), we obtain multi-sorted signature LΘ . The corresponding multi-sorted language is defined by induction on length and sort of formulas.

The value ValXH(u) of a formula u∈Φ(X) in a Θ-algebra H is defined according to the construction. Elements of ValXH(u) are points μ:W(X)  →  H.

Now we recall the model-theoretical notion of type of an n-tuple ā. Such a type will be called MT-type. It is worth to mention that we do not consider types depending of parameters (the more general definition can be found in [\cite=chloe]). The problem arises how two tuples are algebraically connected if their MT-types coincide.

Two kinds of types defined above (MT- and LG-type) are sets of formulas in different languages. We will prove below that the two points μ and ν have the same X-LG-type if and only if the n-tuples [formula] and [formula] have the same MT-type.

Relations between logical-geometrical types and model-theoretical types

Let H1 and H2 be Θ-algebras. Let [formula] and [formula] be n-tuples in H1 and H2 respectively. Consider two corresponding points ν:W(X)  →  H1 and μ:W(X)  →  H2 where [formula], ν(xi) = ai and μ(xi) = bi, [formula]. Then LKer(ν) = LKer(μ) if and only if tpH1(ā) = tpH2().

We will prove this statement by several steps.

LKer(ν) = LKer(μ)  ⇒  tpH1(ā) = tpH2().

Let LKer(ν)=LKer(μ). Let u∈tpH1(ā). Under Definition [\ref=MT_Type], we have that [formula] with listed variables, where [formula] have free occurrences only, all [formula] are bounded, and [formula].

On the other hand, according to Definition [\ref=formula], [formula], where [formula]. Therefore for every homomorphism [formula] such that γ(xi) = ai,[formula] (values of γ(yj) do not influence), we have [formula] (see definitions (1)-(4) from [\ref=Val]). Consider arbitrary homomorphism [formula] such that s(xi) = xi, [formula] and construct the formula v = s*u∈Φ(X). Since [formula], [formula], we have [formula]. Under definition [\ref=Val] (5), we obtain that ν∈ValXH1(v) and therefore v∈LKerν.

Since LKer(ν)=LKer(μ), we have v∈LKerμ, that is, μ∈ValXH2(v) which implies that [formula]. Let [formula] be an an arbitrary homomorphism such that δ(xi) = bi for all [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] for all [formula] and the variables from Y are bounded in u , we obtain that the values of the formula u under interpretations δ and [formula] coincide. Therefore [formula], that is, u∈tpH2(). Consequently tpH1(ā)  ⊆  tpH2(). The inverse inclusion is also true by symmetry.

Now we assign to every formula u∈Φ(X),  X∈Γ, a formula ũ in the one-sorted first order language, that is, a formula which does not contain symbols s*. Let 0 be a copy of X0 such that to every variable x∈X0 the variable ∈0 corresponds one to one. Consider the first-order language L associated with the variety Θ with set [formula] of variables using variables from X0 for free variables and variables from 0 for bounded ones only.

We construct the formula ũ for every formula u∈Φ(X),  X∈Γ, inductively.

1. If u is [formula] then ũ = u.

2. If u is [formula] or [formula] then [formula] or [formula] respectively.

3. If [formula] and x∈X then [formula], where [formula] denotes the formula in L which is obtained by replacing of all occurrences of the variable x in ṽ by [formula].

4. Let [formula] and s:W(Y)  →  W(X) be a homomorphism, v∈Φ(Y) and u = s*v. Then [formula]. Notice that all occurrences of elements from X and Y in ṽ can be free only.

For every point μ:W(X)  →  H and every u∈Φ(X)

[formula]

where [formula], [formula].

We will prove this statement by induction according to the construction of formulas of sort X.

1. Let u be [formula]. Under definition, u∈LKer(μ) means that μ(w) = μ(w'). In the considered case, ũ = u and we obtain that u∈LKer(μ) is equal to [formula], that is, to ũ∈tpH(ā).

2. For [formula]) or [formula] our statement is obviously true.

3. Let [formula] , where x∈X. Assume that our statement is true for v. The fact u∈LKer(μ) means that there exists a point ν:W(X)  →  H which coincides with μ for all y∈X besides x and such that ν∈ValXH(v). Under assumption, ν∈ValXH(v) is equal to ṽ∈tpH() where [formula]. Since [formula], we obtain that u∈LKer(μ) is equal to ũ∈tpH(ā) where [formula]. Notice that ũ does not contain x.

4. Let [formula], s:W(Y)  →  W(X) be a homomorphism, v∈Φ(Y), and u = s*v. Assume that our statement is true for v. This means that [formula] is equal to ṽ∈tpH(), where [formula]. Further, [formula] is equal to u∈LKer(μ) and ṽ∈tpH() is equal to ũ∈tpH(ā) because [formula] according to the definition, and hence [formula] is the same that [formula]. Thus our statement is true for u too.

tpH1(ā) = tpH2()  ⇒  LKer(ν) = LKer(μ)

Let tpH1(ā) = tpH2(). Let u∈Φ(X) and u∈LKerν. Then according to Lemma [\ref=AssociatedForm], ũ∈tpH1(ā). Consequently ũ∈tpH2() and therefore u∈LKerμ according to the same Lemma.

In virtue of Lemmas [\ref=1] and [\ref=2], Theorem [\ref=twoTypes] is proved.

Logically perfect algebras

The purpose of this section is to present some results concerning logically perfect algebras. Some authors call an algebra H homogeneous if every automorphism between two finitely generated subalgebras of H can be extended to an automorphism of H. It is easy to see that every homogeneous algebra is logically perfect [\cite=Plotkin_IsotAlg].

It is obvious that every finite dimensional linear space V is a homogeneous algebra, and therefore V is logically perfect. On the other hand, it is easy to see that free finitely generated semigroups and free finitely generated Abelian groups are not homogeneous, nevertheless we will show below that all of them are logically perfect. Thus the homogeneity is not a necessary condition for an algebra to be logically perfect. There is a logical condition equivalent to homogeneity obtained by the author. This condition is cited in [\cite=Plotkin_IsotAlg] and called there strictly logically perfectness. The following generalization of homogeneity will be useful.

Every weakly homogeneous finitely generated free algebra is logically perfect.

Let H be weakly homogeneous and e1,...,en be free generators of H. Let X = {x1,...,xk}. Consider two points ν,μ:W(X)  →  H and suppose that LKerν = LKerμ. Let ν(xi) = ai and μ(xi) = bi for all i = 1,...,k. Take Y = {y1,...,yn}, such that [formula], and define a homomorphism γ:W(Y)  →  H by the values: γ(yi) = ei,  i = 1,...,n. Let w1,...,wk∈W(Y) be any k words such that ai  =  γ(wi),  i = 1,...,k.

Consider a formula u of sort X of the kind u = s*(v) where

[formula]

and [formula] defined by s(xi) = xi,s(y1) = ... = s(yn) = x1.

It is obvious that ν∈ValH(u). Thus under assumption, μ∈ValH(u) and therefore [formula]. The last one means that there exists a homomorphism δ:W(Y)  →  H such that bi  =  δ(wi),  i = 1,...,k. Define an endomorphism σ of H setting σ(ei) = δ(yi),  i = 1,...,n, that is, [formula]. We have σ(ai) = σ(γ(wi)) = δ(wi) = bi for i = 1,...,k. Hence σ determines a homomorphism φ of the subalgebra A generated by a1,...,ak on the subalgebra B generated by b1,...,bk.

Similarly, we can define an endomorphism τ of H such that τ(bi) = ai for i = 1,...k. Consequently [formula] and [formula] which means that the restriction φ of σ to A is an isomorphism of A on B and φ- 1 is a restriction of τ. Since H is weakly homogeneous, φ can be extended up to automorphism [formula] of H for which we have [formula].

Finitely generated free Abelian groups and finitely generated free nilpotent groups are weakly homogeneous.

1. We start with considering Abelian groups. Let G and F be free Abelian groups of the same rank n. Let A and B be two subgroups of G and F respectively which are isomorphic by means of an isomorphism φ:A  →  B. We will prove that if φ and φ- 1 both can be extended up to homomorphisms σ:G  →  F and τ:F  →  G respectively, then φ can be extended up to an isomorphism of G onto F.

It is known ([\cite=Magnus], Theorem 3.5) that there exists a base g1,...,gn of G and a base a1,...,ak of A such that ai = pigi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k where p1,...,pk are integers and every pi + 1 is divisible by pi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 . Exactly in the same way, there exists a base f1,...,fn of F and a base b1,...,bk of B such that bi = qifi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and every integer qi + 1 is divisible by the integer qi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1.

Let [formula] and [formula]. We obtain two integer matrices of order n: S = ||sji|| and T = ||tji||. Since φ:A  →  B is an isomorphism, φ provides an invertible integer matrix ||aji|| of order k, where [formula]. Let ||bji|| be its inverse matrix: [formula].

Since σ(ai)  =  φ(ai), we obtain [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k. Thus for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k we have [formula]. This implies that pisji  =  ajiqj for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k and pisji = 0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, k + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. In view of the definitions of pi,qi, we have p1 = q1 and sji = 0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and k + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n.

By duality, we obtain qitji  =  bjipj for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k and tji = 0 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k and k + 1  ≤  j  ≤  n. Therefore we obtain for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k :

[formula]

Consider the left corner k-th minor M of the matrix S, that is, the determinant of the matrix ||sji||1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k. According to (1) M = 1 or M =  - 1. Define map :G  →  F setting

[formula]

The matrix V of this map is

We see that DetV = M =   ±  1 and therefore [formula] is an isomorphism. By construction, (ai) = mi(gi) = miσ(gi) = σ(ai) = φ(ai) for all i  ≤  k. Consequently [formula] extends φ.

2. Now let H be a finitely generated free nilpotent group of class c > 1 and rank n. Let A and B be two subgroups of H which are isomorphic by means of an isomorphism φ:A  →  B. Let φ and φ- 1 both can be extended up to endomorphisms σ and τ of H respectively.

The quotient group G = H / H' is a free Abelian group of the same rank n. Let η:H  →  G be the corresponding epimorphism. Then Ā  =  η(A) and   =  η(B) are isomorphic subgroups of G under isomorphism [formula]. This isomorphism is contained in the endomorphism [formula] and the inverse isomorphism - 1 is contained in the endomorphism [formula]. Thus we can apply the fact proved above in the point 1, that is, [formula] can be extended up to automorphism [formula] of G.

Consider this extension in details. A base g1,...,gn of Abelian group G and a base ā1,...,āk of its subgroup Ā are chosen such that āi  =  gpii for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k (now we use the multiplicative notation). The automorphism [formula] of G extending [formula] is constructed in such a way that (gi) = (gi) for i  ≤  k. The elements fi  =  (gi) for [formula] form a base of G in which first k elements are equal to corresponding (gi).

It is known from the theory of nilpotent groups (see for example [\cite=Kurosh]) that a system [formula] of elements of H is a system of free generators of some free nilpotent subgroup of the same class if and only if the the system [formula] is linear independent in G = H / H'. So if [formula] is a base of G then [formula] is a base of a free nilpotent subgroup H0 of G. Since η(H0) = G, we have H0H' = H. The last one implies that H0 = H. We obtain that if [formula] is a base of G then [formula] is a base of H. Below we apply this property of finitely generated free nilpotent groups.

There exist bases [formula] and [formula] of H such that η(hi) = gi and η(ui) = fi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Of course we can chose ui  =  σ(hi) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k because η(σ(hi)) = (gi) = fi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k.

Now we define an automorphism Φ of H setting Φ(hi) = ui for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. On the other hand, elements hpii 1  ≤  i  ≤  k form a base of the free nilpotent subgroup AH' because η(hpii) = gpii  =  . We have Φ(hpii) = (Φ(hi))pi = upii = (σ(hi))pi  =  σ(hpii). Thus Φ coincides with σ on the subgroup AH'. Since σ contains φ which is defined on A  ⊂  AH', Φ is an extension of φ.

Every finitely generated free semigroup is weakly homogeneous.

Let S be a free semigroup with the set [formula] of free generators . Let φ:A  →  B be an automorphism between two subsemigroups A and B of S, where A and B are generated by elements [formula] and [formula] respectively. We may assume that φ(ai) = bi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Suppose that there exist two endomorphisms σ and τ first of which extends φ and the second one extends φ- 1. Thus σ(ai) = bi and τ(bi) = ai Denote by |w| the length of the word w in alphabet X. Since |σ(w)|  ≥  |w| and |τ(w)|  ≥  |w| for every w∈S, we obtain that |ai|  =  |bi|. Let [formula] be the list of all variables from X which occur in [formula] and [formula] be the analogical list of all variables which occur in [formula]. It is obvious that |σ(yi)| = 1 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  p and |τ(zi)| = 1 for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  q. Therefore we have that [formula] and [formula].

Since τ(σ(ai)) = ai and σ(τ(bi)) = bi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, we have that the restrictions of σ and τ to variables [formula] and [formula] respectively are mutually inverse maps. Thus p = q and σ and τ induce two mutually inverse partial one-to-one transformations of X. Let α be a bijection of [formula] on [formula]. Setting (yi) = σ(yi) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  p and (x) = α(x) for all other variables from X, we obtain the automorphism [formula] of S which extends φ.

Lemmas [\ref=abel], [\ref=Sem] and [\ref=W_Hom] give us the following result:

Finitely generated free Abelian groups, finitely generated free nilpotent groups of any class and finitely generated semigroups are logically perfect.

The method which has been used to prove the theorem above can not be applied to non-Abelian finitely generated free groups.

Free groups of rank 2 are not weakly homogeneous.

Consider the free group [formula] of rank 2 free generated by x1,x2. Let a = x21x2x- 11x2 and b = x1x2. Define endomorphisms σ and τ setting σ(x1) = x1x2,  σ(x2) = 1 and τ(x1) = x21x2,  τ(x2) = x- 11x2. We see that σ(a) = b and τ(b) = a. Thus σ induces an isomorphism of φ:〈a〉  →  〈b〉 and τ induces the inverse isomorphism φ- 1.

Suppose that there exists an automorphism [formula] of [formula] which sends a to b. Let (x1) = w1 , (x2) = w2, where w1,w2 are words in symbols x1,x2. Thus we have a relation in our free group: [formula]. (*)

This relation must be an identity in the group variety. Let l1,l2 be the sums of all exponents of x1,x2 incoming in w1 and m1,m2 the sums of all exponents of x1,x2 incoming in w2 respectively. It is obvious that l1 + 2m1 = l2 + 2m2 = 1. Thus l1,l2 must be odd numbers.

Consider the group S3 of all permutations of the set {1,2,3} . This group is a homomorphic image of [formula] under the map γ which maps x1 to (213) and x2 to (132). Since γ(x21) = γ(x22) = (123),  γ(x1x2) = (312),  γ(x2x1) = (231),  γ(x1x2x1)  =  γ(x2x1x2) = (321),  γ((x1x2)2) = γ(x2x1),  γ((x2x1)2) = γ(x1x2), we obtain that the following equalities are satisfied in S3: [formula] or [formula]. For w2 we have variants: [formula]. Since w1,w2 generate [formula], their images generate S3. Therefore we have only three variants for w2: [formula]. Directly calculations show that in all mentioned cases γ(w21w2w- 11w2) = (123) which contradicts to the identity (*).

Consequently there is no automorphism of [formula] sending a to b.

Nevertheless all free finitely generated non-Abelian free groups are logically perfect. This fact is proved in [\cite=chloe] in view of Theorem [\ref=twoTypes].

Isotyped algebras

We consider the following problem: in what cases isotyped algebras are necessarily isomorphic. At first, we generalize the result obtained in [\cite=PZ], Theorem 3.11.

If two algebras H1 and H2 from the same variety Θ are isotyped then for every finitely generated subalgebra A of H1 there exists a subalgebra B of H2 isomorphic to A, and if A is a proper subalgebra then B can be chosen as a proper subalgebra too.

Let H1 and H2 be isotyped Θ-algebras. Let [formula] where [formula] are different elements in H1. Consider the free Θ-algebra W(X), where [formula]. Let ν∈ hom (W(X),H1) defined by ν(xi) = ai for [formula]. Since H1 and H2 are isotyped there exists a point μ∈ hom (W(X),H2) such that LKerν  =  LKerμ. We obtain a subalgebra [formula] of H2 and B = μ(W(X)). Since Kerν = Kerμ, algebras A and B are isomorphic.

Let now A be a proper subalgebra of H1 and let [formula]. Add to X a new variable [formula] and consider a new point [formula] setting ν(xi) = ai for all [formula]. For every w∈W(X) consider the following formula [formula]:

[formula]

Under condition that H1 and H2 are isotyped, there exists a point [formula] such that LKerν  =  LKerμ. Since [formula], the subalgebra B generated by [formula] is isomorphic to A. On the other hand, it is obvious that vw∈LKerν and hence vw∈LKerμ for every w∈W(X). The last one means that μ(xn + 1) does not belong to B, that is, B is a proper subalgebra of H2.

Let a finitely generated algebra H contain no proper subalgebra isomorphic to H. Then every algebra G isotyped to H is isomorphic to H.

Let H and G be isotyped algebras. Since H is finitely generated, there exists a subalgebra B of G isomorphic to H. If B is a proper subalgebra of G then H contains a proper subalgebra A which is isomorphic to B and therefore A is isomorphic to H but this is impossible according to the hypotheses. Thus B = G.

We can apply this result to finitely dimensional linear spaces but it is not the case for finitely generated free Abelian groups. However the next result can be obtained using Theorem [\ref=NecessaryIso].

If two Abelian groups are isotyped and one of them is free and finitely generated then they are isomorphic.

Let H and G be isotyped Abelian groups and H be free of rank n. Then every finitely generated subgroup of G is isomorphic to a subgroup of H. Therefore every finitely generated subgroup of G is free of a rank k  ≤  n. This means that every n + 1 elements of G are linearly dependent. On the other hand, H is isomorphic to a subgroup B of G. Let [formula] is a base of B. These elements form a maximal linearly independent system in G. We obtain that rank of G is equal to n.

It remains to show that G is finitely generated. Let [formula] be a base of H. Consider the following countable set of formulas [formula], indexed by n-tuples [formula] of integers, which not all are equal to zero and formulas [formula], indexed by n + 1-tuples [formula] of integers , where [formula] :

[formula]

[formula]

Every such formula is satisfied in H by the tuple [formula]. Indeed, for the formulas [formula] this statement is obvious. Consider the formulas [formula]. Suppose that for an element h∈H we have [formula] for some integers [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] is a base, [formula] for some integers [formula]. It obvious that [formula]. Thus all considered formulas belong to tpH().

Since H and G are isotyped, all formulas [formula] and [formula] belong to tpG() for some n-tuple [formula] in G. First of all this means that elements [formula] are linearly independent. Let g be an arbitrary element in G. Since rank of G is n, the elements [formula] are linearly dependent, that is, [formula] for some integers [formula], which not all are equal to zero. Taking into account that the first n elements are linearly independent, we conclude that [formula]. Since [formula] is valid in G, we obtain that

[formula]

This means that [formula] for some integers [formula].

Consequently G it is generated by [formula], and therefore G is isomorphic to H.

Conjecture. It seems to be probable that analogous result takes place for nilpotent groups too.

Remark B. Plotkin writes [\cite=Plotkin_IsotAlg] that Z. Sela has proved a similar fact for free non-commutative groups (unpublished).
