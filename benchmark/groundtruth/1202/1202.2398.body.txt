The Pompeiu problem and discrete groups

Introduction

Let [formula] be the complex numbers, [formula] the real numbers, [formula] the integers and [formula] the natural numbers. Let [formula] and let K be a finite family of compact subsets of [formula]. The Pompeiu problem asks under what conditions on K will f  =  0 be the only continuous function on [formula] that satisfies

[formula]

for all K∈K and for all rigid motions σ? The answer to this question is no when K contains only a sphere of positive radius. This led to what is known as the two circle problem, which asks if K consists of two spheres of positive radius r1 and r2, then is f  =  0 the only continuous function satisfying ([\ref=eq:contpomp])? It turns out that the answer is yes as long as the ratio r1 / r2 avoids a certain exceptional subset of [formula]. See Sections 5 and 6 of the excellent paper [\cite=Zalcman80] for the details.

A variant of the Pompeiu problem is the following two circle problem: Let f be a continuous function on [formula], denote by Sr(x) the sphere of radius r centered at x. Suppose

[formula]

for r  =  r1,r2 and all x∈X. Does this imply f is harmonic on [formula]? The answer to this two radius problem is also yes as long as the quotient r1  /  r2 avoids a certain exceptional subset, depending on n, of [formula]. For more information see [\cite=Zalcman80]. The Pompeiu problem and some of its variations have been studied in various contexts, see [\cite=BerensteinZalcman80] [\cite=CareyKaniuthMoran91] [\cite=CohenPicardello88] [\cite=PeyerimhoffSamior10] [\cite=RawatSitaram97] [\cite=ScottSitaram88] [\cite=Zalcman80] and the references therein for more information. The purpose of this study is to investigate ([\ref=eq:contpomp]) and ([\ref=eq:contmeanvalue]) in the discrete group setting.

For the rest of this paper G will always denote a discrete group. So, the compact subsets of G are precisely the finite subsets of G and all complex-valued functions on G are continuous. Let K be a finite collection of finite subsets of G. We now state the Pompeiu problem for discrete groups with respect to left translations.

We shall say that K has the Pompeiu property with respect to left translations if f = 0 is the only function from the class of functions under consideration that satisfies ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]). For brevity, we will say that K has the Pompeiu property when it has the Pompeiu property with respect to left translations.

Now suppose G is finitely generated with generating set [formula]. The Cayley graph Γ of G is the graph whose vertices are the elements of G, and g,h∈G are connected by an edge if and only if h  =  gx±  1i for some generator xi of G. Note that Γ is a connected graph. Now G is a metric space via the shortest path metric on Γ. That is, if x,y∈G, then d(x,y) equals the number of edges of the shortest path in Γ joining x and y. Let x∈G and let [formula]. The sphere of radius n centered at x is defined to be

[formula]

The cardinality of Sn(x) will be denoted by |Sn(x)|. A complex-valued function f on G is said to satisfy the mean-value property for radius n if

[formula]

for all x∈G. We now state a problem that is a discrete group version of ([\ref=eq:contmeanvalue]).

In Section [\ref=preliminaries] we give needed definitions and prove some preliminary results. In particular we make a connection between the problem of zero divisors on torsion free discrete groups and Problem [\ref=rightpompeiu]. We will give some examples of groups for which ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) is true when we assume an extra condition on the decay of f. We state our main results in Section [\ref=statementmainresults]. The torsion free rank of an abelain group G, which we shall denote by r0(G), is the cardinality of a maximal independent system of elements in G of infinite order. Indicate the cardinal of the continuum by 2ω. In Section [\ref=abelianpompeiu] we prove Theorem [\ref=abelianchar], which gives necessary and sufficient conditions on a finite collection of finite subsets of G to have the Pompeiu property when G is abelian and r0(G)  <  2ω. Let Fk be the free group on k generators, where k  ≥  2. In Section [\ref=freegroupspompeiu] we prove Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar], which gives necessary and sufficient conditions on a finite set of finite radial subsets, to be defined in Section [\ref=statementmainresults], of Fk to have the Pompeiu property. Furthermore, in Section [\ref=freegroupspompeiu] we will explain how our results for Fk overlap with some of the results in [\cite=CohenPicardello88], where two circle problems are studied on homogenous trees. In Section [\ref=meanvalue] we study Problem [\ref=discretetworadharm] for free groups. In particular, we give a sufficient condition which guarantees that the harmoncity of a function f on Fk is equivalent to it having the mean-value property over two spheres.

I would like to thank Peter Linnell for making many useful comments on an earlier version of the paper.

Preliminaries and the problem of zero divisors

For [formula] will denote the complex conjugate of z. We represent a complex-valued function f on G by a formal sum [formula] where [formula] and f(g)  =  ag. Also, we shall write [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula]. Indicate by F(G) the set of all functions on G. For [formula], [formula] will consist of those formal sums for which [formula], and [formula], the group ring of G over [formula], will consist of all formal sums that satisfy ag  =  0 for all but finitely many g. The group ring [formula] can also be thought of as the set of all functions on G with compact support. For g∈G and f∈F(G), the left translate Lg(f) of f is defined to be (Lg(f))(x)  =  f(gx).

Let [formula] and [formula]. Define a map [formula] by

[formula]

For a fixed h∈F(G),〈  ·  ,h〉 is a linear functional on [formula]. Now let T be a linear functional on [formula]. Define [formula] for each g∈G. Thus each linear functional on [formula] defines an element of F(G). Hence, the dual of [formula] can be identified with F(G). If E is a subset of G, denote by χE the characteristic function on E. Let g∈G. Observe that Lg(χE)  =  χg- 1E. Suppose [formula] for all g∈G and for some finite subset K of G. Then

[formula]

We have just proved Lemma [\ref=translates] will eventually allow us to give a link between Pompeiu's problem and the problem of zero divisors.

Let X represent either [formula] or [formula]. For [formula] and [formula], we define a multiplication, known as convolution, [formula] by

[formula]

Set [formula] and [formula]. Note that for [formula]. Then

[formula]

and [formula]. The result now follows.

By combining Lemma [\ref=translates] and Lemma [\ref=zerodivtrans] we obtain

We just saw that there is a connection between Pompeiu's problem on discrete groups and the following problem concerning zero divisors.

We point out that if G is not torsion free, then there are zero divisors in [formula]. For example, let 1 be the identity element of G and let g∈G such that g  ≠  1 and gn  =  1 for some [formula]. Then [formula]. It now follows that the set [formula] does not have the Pompeiu property. To see this, set [formula] and note [formula]. Using the fact g- k  =  gn - k for 0  ≤  k  ≤  n, we have [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=pompeiuzerodiv], f  =  1 - g satisfies ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) when [formula] and gn = 1.

The zero divisor problem has been studied in [\cite=Cohen81] [\cite=Linnell91] [\cite=Linnell92] [\cite=LinnellPuls01] [\cite=Puls98]. Using results obtained in some of these papers we can give some results concerning ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) for specific groups G and classes of functions on G. For example, in the case [formula], where [formula], if f satisfies ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) and [formula] for [formula], then by [\cite=LinnellPuls01] f  =  0. Let Fk denote the free group on k generators, where k  ≥  2. The main result of [\cite=Linnell92] shows that f  =  0 is the only element of [formula] for which ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) is true. In Section [\ref=freegroupspompeiu] we will see that for p  >  2, there exists a nonzero f in [formula] that satisfies ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) for certain subsets of Fk that are circular.

Statement of main results

We start by assuming G is a discrete abelian group with r0(G)  <  2ω. Let M be a maximal ideal in [formula]. Then [formula] is a field since [formula] is a commutative ring with identity 1. Let [formula] be the natural map. It was shown in the proof of Theorem 3 in [\cite=laczkovichgszekelyhidi04] that [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Thus iM can be considered a ring homomorphism from [formula] onto [formula] with kernel M. We define a function [formula] by

[formula]

for a given maximal ideal M of [formula]. Each g∈G is invertible in [formula]. Thus fM(g)  ≠  0 since iM(g)  ≠  0 in [formula]. For [formula], define

[formula]

where M is a maximal ideal in [formula]. For an ideal I in [formula], set [formula]

The main result of Section [\ref=abelianpompeiu] is

We now shift our focus to the free group Fk on k generators, where [formula]. Indicate by e the identity element of Fk. Any element x of Fk has an unique expression as a finite product of generators and their inverses, which does not contain any two adjacent factors ww- 1 or w- 1w. The number of factors in x is called the length of x and is denoted by |x|. The identity element e will have length zero.

A function in F(Fk) is said to be radial if its value depends only on |x|. Let En  =  {x∈Fk||x|  =  n}, and let en indicate the cardinality of En. Then en  =  2k(2k - 1)n - 1 for n  ≥  1, and e0  =  1. We shall say that a subset A of Fk is a radial set if A is the union of sets of the form En. Let χn denote the characteristic function on En, so as an element of [formula] we have [formula]. Then every radial function has the form [formula], where [formula]. Let [formula] denote the radial functions contained in [formula] and let [formula]. It was shown in [\cite=Figa_Picardello83] that

[formula]

hence [formula] is a commutative ring which is generated by χ0 and χ1.

For [formula] define polynomials pn(z) by

[formula]

For [formula], define a function [formula] by

[formula]

Let Z(α)  =  {z|(z) = 0}. If I is an ideal in [formula], then set [formula]

In Section [\ref=freegroupspompeiu] we will prove the following result, which is analogous to Theorem [\ref=abelianchar]. Theorems [\ref=abelianchar] and [\ref=pompeiufreechar] are consequences of Theorems [\ref=wienerabelian] and [\ref=wienertypefree] respectively, both of which are Wiener type results.

After a moment's reflection, we see that for free groups Fk the definition of Sn(x) given by ([\ref=eq:defsphere]) is equivalent to

[formula]

where x∈Fk.

The Laplacian on Fk is defined by

[formula]

where x∈Fk. A function f on Fk is said to be harmonic if [formula] for all x∈Fk. If f is harmonic on Fk, then f satisfies the mean-value property for all natural numbers n; that is, [formula] for all [formula] and for all x∈Fk. The converse to this statement is the free group version of Problem [\ref=discretetworadharm]. In Section [\ref=meanvalue] we give a sufficient condition that guarantees a positive answer to Problem [\ref=discretetworadharm]. More specifically we prove

Proof of Theorem [\ref=abelianchar]

In this section G will always be a discrete abelian group with r0(G)  <  2ω. Recall that if M is a maximal ideal in [formula], then fM(g)  =  iM(g), where [formula] is the natural map. We start with

Suppose α∈M. Then iM(α)  =  0. Because [formula] for x∈G and M is an ideal, iM∈Z(Lx(α)) for each x∈G. We now obtain

[formula]

for all x∈G. By Lemma [\ref=zerodivtrans] [formula].

Conversely, let [formula] and assume that [formula]. Lemma [\ref=zerodivtrans] says that [formula] for all x∈G. In particular

[formula]

Thus, α∈M.

We now state and prove a Wiener type result.

Assume [formula]. Then there exists a maximal ideal M in [formula] for which iM(α)  =  0 for each α∈I. The kernel of iM is precisely M, so α∈M. By Proposition [\ref=killedbyfm], [formula] for all α∈I. Thus 1∉I because [formula] and [formula]. Hence, [formula]

Now suppose [formula]. Let M be a maximal ideal that contains I. Then iM(α)  =  0 for each α∈I. Hence iM∈Z(I).

We now prove Theorem [\ref=abelianchar]. Assume [formula]. Let I be the ideal in [formula] generated by the functions χK,K∈K. Then [formula]. Suppose that K does not have the Pompeiu property. Proposition [\ref=pompeiuzerodiv] says that there exists a nonzero function f∈F(G) for which [formula] for all K∈K. Thus [formula]. Using Theorem [\ref=wienerabelian] we obtain the contradiction [formula]. Thus K has the Pompeiu property.

Conversely, assume [formula]. Then there exists a maximal ideal M in [formula] such that iM∈Z(χK) for each K∈K. Thus χK∈M for each K∈K. By combining Proposition [\ref=killedbyfm] and Proposition [\ref=pompeiuzerodiv] we obtain that K does not have the Pompeiu property. The proof of Theorem [\ref=abelianchar] is complete.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar]

Let Fk denote the free group on k generators, where [formula]. We start the section by giving some definitions and results that will be needed for the proof of Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar]. After giving these results we will prove Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar]. We will conclude the section with a discussion about how our work is connected with some of the results in [\cite=CohenPicardello88].

A slight modification to the proof of [\cite=LinnellPuls01] gives the following elementary result, which will be needed later.

A function ψ on Fk is said to be spherical if and only if it defines a multiplicative linear functional on [formula]. See pages 33-34, especially Lemma 1.5, of [\cite=Figa_Picardello83] for a more detailed discussion about spherical functions on Fk. Let [formula] and define φz∈F(Fk) by

[formula]

Now,

[formula]

By [\cite=Figa_Picardello83] φz is spherical, equivalently it is a multiplicative linear functional on [formula]. We can now prove

Using [formula] with Lemma [\ref=zerodivtrans], [formula] for each n  ≥  0.

Conversely, write [formula]. Then

[formula]

The function [formula] is multiplicative on [formula] because [formula]. Thus [formula] Lemma [\ref=elementary] allows us to deduce that if x∈Fk and |x|  =  n, then [formula] The result now follows from Lemma [\ref=zerodivtrans].

We saw in the proof of the above proposition that [formula] for each positive integer n. The corollary now follows.

We need the following fact about maximal ideals in [formula].

Let [formula] be the polynomial ring over [formula]. The proposition will be proved if we can show [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], since [formula] is isomorphic to [formula] for each maximal ideal J in [formula]. For [formula], define [formula] by

[formula]

We will now show that T gives the desired isomorphism. Clearly T is linear. Note that if [formula], then Tα(z)  =  〈φz,α〉. Combining this observation with the fact φz is multiplicative on [formula] for each [formula], we obtain [formula], where [formula]. If [formula], then it must be the case [formula]. Thus T is one-to-one. Let [formula]. We may assume without loss of generality that q is a monic polynomial. Write [formula], where [formula] and n is the degree of q. The function [formula] and T maps this element to q, so T is onto. Hence T is an isomorphism between [formula] and [formula] and the proposition now follows.

Using the polynomial relations ([\ref=eq:recpolynomials]) with an induction argument we obtain

[formula]

We can now state and prove the following Wiener type result for Fk, which corresponds to Theorem [\ref=wienerabelian].

Suppose [formula] and let z∈Z(I). Then for each [formula] by Corollary [\ref=containzeros]. Since [formula] it follows that [formula].

Conversely, assume [formula]. Let M be a maximal ideal in [formula] that contains I. Then [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Hence, there is a ring homomorphism [formula] for which the kernel of ψ is M. The multiplicative linear functional ψ is determined by its value on χ1. Set z  =  ψ(χ1). Because χn  =  pn(χ1), we obtain ψ(χn)  =  pn(ψ(χ1))  =  pn(z). Consequently, ψ  =  φz. Furthermore, if α∈I, then [formula] for each nonnegative integer n. By Proposition [\ref=radialspan] and Corollary [\ref=containzeros], z∈Z(α) for each α∈I. Therefore, z∈Z(I).

We now prove Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar]. First assume [formula] and let [formula]. Then [formula] for each K∈K. Since χK and φz are both radial, it follows from Proposition [\ref=pompeiuzerodiv] that K does not have the Pompeiu property.

Now assume [formula]. Let I be the ideal in [formula] generated by {χK}K∈K. Then [formula] and by Theorem [\ref=wienertypefree], [formula]. If f∈F(Fk) and [formula] for each K∈K, then [formula]. Hence, it must the case f  =  0 and K has the Pompeiu property. The proof of Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar] is now complete.

A special case of the Pompeiu problem is the two circle problem.

Cohen and Picardello studied this problem in [\cite=CohenPicardello88] for homogeneous trees. The Cayley graph of the free group [formula], is a homogeneous tree of degree 2k. We now proceed to explain how our results overlap with some of the results in [\cite=CohenPicardello88].

Let Kn be the set of elements in Fk that have length n. Each element of Kn has distance n from the identity element e of Fk. From a geometric point of view we can think of Kn as a sphere in Fk of radius n with center e. Denote the characteristic function on Kn by χn. Set

[formula]

Since {0}  =  Z(χ1), Corollary [\ref=containzeros] says that [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] for p  >  2. Because χ1 and φ0 are both radial, [formula]. Thus φ0 satisfies ([\ref=eq:Pompeiu]) by Proposition [\ref=pompeiuzerodiv]. So K1 does not have the Pompeiu property when the class of functions under consideration contains [formula] for some p  >  2. In fact, if n an odd natural number, then 0∈Z(χn) due to   =  Pn(z) being an odd polynomial. Thus [formula] and Kn does not have the Pompeiu property for all odd natural numbers. We now move on to the two circle problem.

Let r and s be natural numbers and set K  =  {Kr,Ks}. Observe that if x∈Fk, then xKr and xKs are spheres in Fk with center x and radius r and s respectively. Consequently, f = 0 is the only solution to ([\ref=eq:twocirclecond]) if and only if K has the Pompeiu property. Theorem [\ref=pompeiufreechar] tells us K has the Pompeiu property precisely when   =  Ps(z) and   =  Pr(z) do not have a common root. If r and s are both odd, then as we saw in the previous paragraph 0 is a common root of both [formula] and [formula]. Thus K does not have the Pompeiu property and φ0 is a nonzero function that satisfies ([\ref=eq:twocirclecond]). This is essentially Theorem 1(a) of [\cite=CohenPicardello88] for the case of homogeneous trees with positive even degree.

Now suppose r and s are both not odd. It was shown in [\cite=CohenPicardello88] that   =  Pr(z) and   =  Ps(z) do not have a common root. Thus K has the Pompeiu property and f = 0 is the only solution to ([\ref=eq:twocirclecond]).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc]

Recall that Fk is the free group on k generators, where k  ≥  2. Before we prove Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc] we need to give several preliminary results. We start with the following crucial lemma, which connects the mean-value property with the problem of zero divisors on Fk.

For x∈Fk,

[formula]

Hence, [formula] for all x∈Fk if and only if [formula]

Define a linear map P:F(Fk)  →  Fr(Fk) by

[formula]

where |x|  =  n.

Our next two results show that in order to prove Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc] we will only need to consider radial functions.

Let n  =  1 and let x∈Fk. Suppose |x|  =  m. Then

[formula]

If w∈Em and y∈E1, then |wy|  =  m + 1 or m - 1. For each g∈Em + 1, there is exactly one element w∈Em and one element y∈χ1 such that g  =  wy. If g∈Em - 1, then there is exactly 2k - 1 elements w∈Em such that g  =  wy for some y∈χ1. Consequently,

[formula]

We now consider the case n  =  2.

[formula]

It now follows from induction that [formula] for all [formula].

Let x∈Fk and assume |x|  =  m. By using Lemma [\ref=factorthrough] and Lemma [\ref=connecttozerodiv], we obtain

[formula]

Thus, [formula]

Our next result shows that z  =  2k is indeed a simple root of pn(z) - en = 0 for all [formula]

Clearly p0(2k)  =  e0 and p1(2k)  =  e1. Let n  ≥  1 and assume pm(2k)  =  em for all m  ≤  n. Then,

[formula]

so z  =  2k is a root of pn(z)  -  en  =  0 for all [formula]

We will now show that pn + 1'(2k)  ≥  pn'(2k) for all n  ≥  1. This will establish that z  =  2k is a root of multiplicity one for pn(z) - en = 0 because p1'(2k)  =  1 and (pn  -  en)'(2k)  =  pn'(2k) for all n  ≥  1. Obviously, p2'(2k)  ≥  p1'(2k). For some n  ≥  2 assume pn'(2k)  ≥  pn - 1'(2k). Thus

[formula]

Hence, pn + 1'(2k)  >  pn'(2k) for all n  ≥  1. Thus z  =  2k is a root of order one for pn(z)  -  en  =  0.

We now prove Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc]. Assume there exists distinct natural numbers n and m such that [formula] for some nonzero f∈F(Fk). There exists an x∈Fk such that f(x)  ≠  0. Replacing f by [formula] if necessary, we may assume f(e)  ≠  0. Hence, P(f)  ≠  0. By Proposition [\ref=reducetoradial] we can and do assume that f∈Fr(Fk). By Lemma [\ref=simpleroot], [formula]. In the proof of Proposition [\ref=maximalideals] it was shown there was an isomorphism between [formula] and [formula]. It now follows that there exists [formula] for which

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=simpleroot] implies 2k∉Z(α1) and 2k∉Z(α2). It now follows from the hypothesis that [formula]. Let I be the ideal in [formula] generated by α1 and α2. Theorem [\ref=wienertypefree] says that [formula] since [formula]. In particular, χ0∈I. Consequently, χ1  -  2k is an element of the ideal generated by [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and f is harmonic.

Conversely, assume f∈F(Fk) is harmonic. Since χ1  -  2k is a factor of χn  -  en, it follows immediately that [formula] for all n  ≥  1. The proof of Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc] is now complete.

An interesting question is the following: What pairs of natural numbers n and m satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc]? The proof of Lemma [\ref=simpleroot] also demonstrates that pn( - 2k)  -  en = 0 for all even [formula]. This is also true because pn(z)  -  en is an even polynomial for all even n. Now

[formula]

For even [formula] since ( - 2k)  =  pn( - 2k)  -  en = 0. It now follows from Corollary [\ref=containzeros] that if both n and m are even, then

[formula]

However, φ- 2k is not harmonic because [formula]. Thus the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc] are not satisfied if n and m are both even.

Equation ([\ref=eq:contmeanvalue]) was studied in the setting of homogeneous trees in [\cite=GonzalezVieli98]. This paper is relevant here since the Cayley graph of Fk is a homogeneous tree of degree 2k. The main result in [\cite=GonzalezVieli98] shows that the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc] is true when n and m are relatively prime. All this leads us to ask if the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=sufficienttwocirc] is true when n and m are both not even?
