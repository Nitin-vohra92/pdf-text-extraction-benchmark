The X-method for klt surfaces in positive characteristic

Introduction

The X-method is a method to prove some fundamental theorems in the minimal model theory of characteristic zero. For example, in characteristic zero, we can show the basepoint free theorem by using the X-method, see for example [\cite=KMM] and [\cite=KM]. The X-method mainly depends on two tools: resolution of singularities and the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, which is a generalization of the Kodaira vanishing theorem. In positive characteristic, we can use resolution of singularities in the case where the dimension of the variety is two or three (cf. [\cite=CP]). But, in positive characteristic, there exist counter-examples to the Kodaira vanishing theorem even in the case where the dimension of the variety is two (cf. [\cite=Raynaud]). Thus, we consider the following question. Can we establish a vanishing theorem in positive characteristic which is sufficient for the X-method? If the dimension of the variety is two, then we have an affirmative answer.

Let X be a smooth projective surface over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Let A be an ample Cartier divisor. Let N be a nef Cartier divisor which is not numerically trivial. If i > 0 and m  ≫  0, then

[formula]

Moreover, by a standard argument, we can generalize this theorem to a vanishing theorem of Kawamata-Viehweg type or Nadel type.

Let X be a smooth projective surface over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Let A be an ample [formula]-divisor whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Let N be a nef Cartier divisor which is not numerically trivial. If i > 0 and m  ≫  0, then

[formula]

Let X be a normal projective surface over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Let Δ be an [formula]-divisor such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let N be a nef Cartier divisor which is not numerically trivial. Let L be a Cartier divisor such that L - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big. If i > 0 and m  ≫  0, then

[formula]

where JΔ is the multiplier ideal of the pair (X,Δ).

Using Theorem [\ref=0nadeltype], we obtain the following basepoint free theorem (cf. [\cite=KM]).

Let X be a projective normal surface over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Let Δ be a [formula]-divisor such that [formula] and KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let D be a nef Cartier divisor which is not numerically trivial. Assume aD - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big for some [formula]. Then there exists a positive integer b0 such that, if b  ≥  b0, then |bD| is basepoint free.

Thus, if we can generalize the above vanishing theorems to the case of threefolds, then we can prove the above basepoint free theorem for threefolds. Unfortunately, however, there exists a counter-example to the above weak Kodaira vanishing theorem in the case where the dimension is three. We construct such counter-examples in Section 5.

By the same argument as the proof of the above weak Kodaira vanishing theorem (Theorem [\ref=0kodairatype]), we can also establish the following vanishing theorem.

Let π:X  →  S be a morphism over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic from a smooth projective variety X to a projective variety S. Let A be a π-ample [formula]-divisor on X whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Set fmax: =  max s∈S dim π- 1(s). If i  ≥  fmax, then

[formula]

Notations

We will freely use the notation and terminology of [\cite=KM].

Our notation will not distinguish between invertible sheaves and Cartier divisors. For example, we will write L + M for invertible sheaves L and M.

For a coherent sheaf F and a Cartier divisor L, we define [formula].

Throughout this paper, we work over an algebraically closed field k of positive characteristic and let char  k = :p > 0.

In this paper, a variety means an integral scheme which is separated and of finite type over k. A curve or a surface means a variety whose dimension is one or two, respectively.

Let X be a projective normal variety and let L be a nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor. We define the numerical dimension [formula] as follows. If L is numerically trivial, then we set ν(X,L) = 0. If L is not numerically trivial, then we define ν(X,L) by

[formula]

Note that L is not numerically trivial if and only if ν(X,L)  ≥  1.

Vanishing theorems for surfaces

In this section, we establish some vanishing theorems for surfaces. Proposition [\ref=h1proto] is the key in this section. We prove Proposition [\ref=h1proto] by using Proposition [\ref=h2vanishing], the Fujita vanishing theorem and the Frobenius maps.

Thus, let us recall the Fujita vanishing theorem which is a generalization of the Serre vanishing theorem.

Let X be a smooth projective variety. Let F be a coherent sheaf and let A be an ample [formula]-divisor. Then there exists a positive integer m(F,A) such that

[formula]

for every i > 0, every integer m  ≥  m(F,A) and every nef [formula]-divisor N.

See [\cite=Fujita1] or [\cite=Fujita2].

Since we would like to work over [formula]-divisors, let us generalize the Fujita vanishing theorem to real coefficients.

Let X be a smooth projective variety. Let F be a coherent sheaf and let A be an ample [formula]-divisor. Then there exists a positive real number r(F,A) such that

[formula]

for every i > 0, every real number r  ≥  r(F,A) and every nef [formula]-divisor N such that rA + N is a [formula]-divisor.

First, we prove that we may assume that A is a [formula]-divisor. Consider the equation:

[formula]

where A' and A'' are ample and A' is a [formula]-divisor. Note that we can find A' and A'' by changing the coefficients of (1 / 2)A a little. Thus we obtain the desired reduction by letting rA + N = rA' + (N + rA'').

Thus we may assume that A is a [formula]-divisor. Take a positive integer m1 such that m1A is a [formula]-divisor. Then we obtain the assertion by Fact [\ref=Zfujitavanishing] and the equation rA + N = mm1A + ((r - mm1)A + N).

Let us consider the following Serre-Fujita type vanishing theorem for surfaces.

Let X be a smooth projective surface and let F be a coherent sheaf on X. Let N be a nef [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Then there exists a positive real number r(F,N) such that

[formula]

for every positive real number r  ≥  r(F,N) and for every nef [formula]-divisor N' such that rN + N' is a [formula]-divisor.

Since X is projective, we obtain the following exact sequence:

[formula]

where A is a sufficiently ample [formula]-divisor. Tensoring by OX( - A + rN + N'), we have

[formula]

Thus we may assume that F = :L is an invertible sheaf. By Serre duality, we have

[formula]

Take an ample [formula]-divisor A'. By ν(X,N)  ≥  1, we see N  ·  A' > 0. Then, for every sufficiently large number r, we obtain

[formula]

This implies H0(X,KX - L - rN - N') = 0.

Now, we prove the following weak Kodaira vanishing theorem, by using the above vanishing result for H2.

Let X be a smooth projective surface and let A be an ample [formula]-divisor. Let N be a nef [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Then there exists a positive real number r(A,N) such that

[formula]

for every positive real number r  ≥  r(A,N) and for every nef [formula]-divisor N' such that A + rN + N' is a [formula]-divisor.

Consider the following exact sequence

[formula]

where F:X  →  X is the Frobenius map, that is the p-th power map, and B is the kernel of F*ωX  →  ωX. Considering the composition of the pushforwards by [formula], we obtain

[formula]

for some coherent sheaf Be.

Tensoring by OX(A + rN + N'), we have

[formula]

We can find a large integer e > 0 such that

[formula]

Note that, by the Fujita vanishing theorem, we can take e independent of r and N'. By Proposition [\ref=h2vanishing], we have

[formula]

for every large r. These imply

[formula]

In order to generalize the above weak Kodaira vanishing theorem to a vanishing theorem of Kawamata-Viehweg type, we recall the following covering lemma.

Let X be an n-dimensional smooth variety. Let D be a [formula]-divisor such that the support of the fractional part {D} is simple normal crossing. Moreover suppose that, for the prime decomposition [formula], no integers a(i) are divisible by p. Then there exists a finite surjective morphism γ:Y  →  X from a smooth variety Y with the following properties.

The field extension K(Y) / K(X) is a Galois extension.

γ*D is a [formula]-divisor.

[formula], where G is the Galois group of K(Y) / K(X).

If D' is a [formula]-divisor such that {D'}  =  {D}, then γ*D' is a [formula]-divisor and [formula].

See [\cite=KMM].

Now, we can generalize the above weak Kodaira vanishing (Proposition [\ref=h1proto]) to the following weak Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing.

Let X be a smooth projective surface. Let B be a nef and big [formula]-divisor whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Let N be a nef [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Then there exists a positive real number r(B,N) such that

[formula]

for every i > 0, every positive real number r  ≥  r(B,N) and every nef [formula]-divisor N' such that rN + N' is a [formula]-divisor.

If i = 2, then the assertion follows from Proposition [\ref=h2vanishing]. Thus we assume i = 1.

By this theorem, we obtain the relative Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem for non-trivial morphisms.

Let π:X  →  S be a proper morphism from a smooth surface X to a variety S. Let B be a π-nef and π-big [formula]-divisor whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Assume dim π(X)  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

By the same argument as Step 2 of Theorem [\ref=kvvtype], we may assume that B = :A is π-ample. We may assume that S is affine. Moreover, by taking suitable compactifications of S and X  →  S, we may assume that X and S are projective. (See, for example, the proof of [\cite=KMM].) Let AS be an ample invertible sheaf on S and set N: = π*AS. Then ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Therefore the assertion follows from Theorem [\ref=kvvtype] and the following Leray spectral sequence

[formula]

In order to generalize the above weak Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem to a vanishing theorem of Nadel type, we recall the definition of the multiplier ideals.

Let X be a normal surface and let Δ be an [formula]-divisor on X such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let μ:X'  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ). We define a multiplier ideal sheaf JΔ by

[formula]

Note that, in the case of surfaces, we can use the resolution of singularities in positive characteristic (cf. [\cite=Lipman2]). Thus, we can establish some fundamental properties (cf. [\cite=Lazarsfeld]). For example, we see that JΔ is independent of log resolutions and that if Δ  ≥  0, then JΔ  ⊂  OX.

Now, we prove the weak Nadel vanishing theorem, which is the main theorem in this section.

Let X be a projective normal surface and let Δ be an [formula]-divisor such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let N be a nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Let L be a Cartier divisor such that L - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big. Then there exists a positive real number r(Δ,L,N) such that

[formula]

for every i > 0, every positive real number r  ≥  r(Δ,L,N) and every nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor N' such that rN + N' is a Cartier divisor.

Let μ:X'  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ). Set

[formula]

Consider the following Leray spectral sequence:

[formula]

The assertion is equivalent to Ei,0 = 0. We see

[formula]

Thus, by Theorem [\ref=relativekvv], we have Ei,j2 = 0 for j > 0. This means Ei,02 = Ei. Moreover, by Theorem [\ref=kvvtype], we see that Ei = 0 for r  ≫  0.

Let π:X  →  S be a proper morphism from a normal surface X to a variety S. Let Δ be an [formula]-divisor such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let L be a Cartier divisor such that L - (KX  +  Δ) is π-nef and π-big. Assume dim π(X)  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

We may assume i = 1. Let μ:X'  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ). We have

[formula]

by the exact sequence induced from the corresponding Grothendieck-Leray spectral sequence. The latter term vanishes by Corollary [\ref=relativekvv].

The following two results are vanishing theorems of Kawamata-Viehweg type for klt surfaces.

Let (X,Δ) be a projective klt surface where Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor. Let N be a nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Let D be a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor such that D - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big. Then there exists a positive real number r(Δ,D,N) such that

[formula]

for every i > 0, every positive real number r  ≥  r(Δ,D,N) and every nef [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor N' such that rN + N' is a Cartier divisor.

Let μ:X'  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ). Set

[formula]

Consider the following Leray spectral sequence:

[formula]

The assertion is equivalent to Ei,02 = 0 because

[formula]

The above second equality holds because (X,Δ) is klt and D is a [formula]-divisor. We see

[formula]

Thus, by Theorem [\ref=relativekvv], we have Ei,j2 = 0 for j > 0. This means Ei,02 = Ei. Moreover, by Theorem [\ref=kvvtype], we see that Ei = 0 for r  ≫  0.

Let π:X  →  S be a proper morphism from a normal surface X to a variety S. Assume that (X,Δ) is a klt surface where Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor. Let D be a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor such that D - (KX  +  Δ) is π-nef and π-big. Assume dim π(X)  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

We may assume i = 1. Let μ:X'  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ). We have

[formula]

by the exact sequence induced from the corresponding Grothendieck-Leray spectral sequence and the proof of Theorem [\ref=kltkvv]. The latter term vanishes by Corollary [\ref=relativekvv].

X-method for surfaces

In this section, we apply the vanishing theorems which are established in Section 2 to the minimal model theory. First, we see the non-vanishing theorem.

Let (X, - G) be a projective klt surface where G is a [formula]-divisor. Note that - G may not be effective. Let D be a nef Cartier divisor D such that ν(X,D)  ≥  1 and aD - (KX - G) is nef and big for some [formula].

Then there exists a positive integer m0 such that

[formula]

for m  ≥  m0.

Since the proof is almost identical to that of [\cite=KM], we will only discuss the necessary changes to their argument. The numbers of Step" are the same as [\cite=KM].

The argument of Step 0 works without any changes. Because we assume ν(X,D)  ≥  1, there is nothing to prove in Step 1. The arguments of Step 2, Step 3, Step 4 and Step 5 work without any changes.

In Step 6, we modify the argument a little. It is sufficient to prove

[formula]

where Y and N(b,c) are the notations in [\cite=KM]. Note that, by Step 4 and Step 5, we may assume that b is sufficiently large. Then, by Theorem [\ref=kvvtype] and the definition of N(b,c), we obtain the above vanishing result for every b  ≫  0.

Second, we prove the following basepoint free theorem.

Let X be a projective normal surface and let Δ be a [formula]-divisor such that [formula] and KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. Let D be a nef Cartier divisor such that ν(X,D)  ≥  1. Assume aD - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big for some [formula]. Then there exists a positive integer b0 such that if b  ≥  b0, then |bD| is basepoint free.

If the pair (X,Δ) is klt, then the proof of [\cite=KM] works by the same modification as Theorem [\ref=nonvanishing]. Thus we assume that the pair (X,Δ) is not klt. Consider the following exact sequence:

[formula]

where MΔ is the closed subscheme corresponding to JΔ. Note that [formula] consists of the non-klt points. In particular, the dimension of MΔ is zero. We can apply Theorem [\ref=nadeltype] for L: = aD and N: = D. Then we see that there exists a positive integer b1 such that if b  ≥  b1, then H0(X,bD)  ≠  0 and the base locus of |bD| contains no non-klt points.

The following argument is a slight modification of [\cite=KM]. Fix an arbitrary prime number q. Let s be a positive integer such that

[formula]

Note that, since X is a noetherian scheme, we can find such an integer s > 0. It is sufficient to prove that [formula] Suppose the contrary and we derive a contradiction. Set m: = qs. By the above argument, we see that [formula] contains no non-klt points.

Let f:Y  →  X be a log resolution of (X,Δ) such that

[formula].

[formula] is ample, where 0 < pj  ≪  1.

[formula], where |L| is basepoint free and [formula] is the fixed locus of f*|mD|.

Since [formula] contains no non-klt points, for every j, the inequality rj > 0 implies aj >  - 1. We define the [formula]-divisor N(b,c) by

[formula]

If b  ≥  cm + a, then N(b,c) is ample. Thus, for b  ≫  0, we have

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=kvvtype].

By a small perturbation of pj, we can find c > 0 and a prime divisor F in the fixed locus of f*|mD|, which satisfy the following property: [formula] where [formula] is effective and F is not a prime component of A. Note that we can find such a number c because the inequality rj > 0 implies aj >  - 1. Set

[formula]

Note that G is an effective f-exceptional [formula]-divisor and f(G) consists of non-klt points. This means [formula] because [formula] contains no non-klt points. Then we have

[formula]

Consider the exact sequence:

[formula]

If b  ≫  0, then H1 of the first term [formula] vanishes. Let us consider the third term [formula]. Since F is disjoint from G, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

H0 of this sheaf does not vanish by the non-vanishing theorem for curves. Then we see [formula]. Let b: = ql for l  ≫  0. Then this is a contradiction.

Let X be a projective normal surface and let Δ be a [formula]-divisor such that [formula] and KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. If KX  +  Δ is nef and big, then KX  +  Δ is semi-ample.

Let c be a positive integer such that c(KX  +  Δ) is Cartier. Then we can apply Theorem [\ref=basepointfree] for D: = c(KX  +  Δ) and a: = 2. Thus |bc(KX  +  Δ)| is basepoint free for b  ≫  0.

We would like to know whether the above basepoint free theorem holds for the case where [formula]. We give the affirmative answer only for the case where X has at worst rational singularities. But our strategy is not the X-method. Let us recall the following known fact.

Let X be a normal surface and let Δ be an effective [formula]-divisor.

If (X,Δ) is klt, then X has at worst rational singularities.

If X has at worst rational singularities, then X is [formula]-factorial.

(1) See, for example, [\cite=Tanaka].

(2) See [\cite=Lipman].

The following result is the key.

Let X be a projective surface whose singularities are at worst rational. Let Δ be an [formula]-Weil divisor such that [formula]. If - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big, then X is a rational surface.

In the case where [formula], the basepoint free theorem is related to the rationality of the log weak del Pezzo surfaces. Indeed, by using the above result, we prove the following basepoint free theorem.

Let X be a projective surface whose singularities are at worst rational. Let Δ be an [formula]-Weil divisor such that [formula]. Let D be a numerically trivial Cartier divisor. If - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big, then D  ~  0.

Let f:X'  →  X be a resolution and set D': = f*D. Since H0(X,D) = H0(X',D'), it is sufficient to prove D'  ~  0. By Theorem [\ref=weakdelpezzo], X' is rational. Therefore [formula] means D'  ~  0.

In [\cite=Tanaka], a basepoint free theorem is established in the case where X is a [formula]-factorial surface (Theorem [\ref=0tanakabasepointfree]). But this result does not contain Corollary [\ref=basepointfree0]. On the other hand, a cone theorem is established under the assumption that X is a normal surface and Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier. For more details, see [\cite=Tanaka].

Other vanishing results

In this section, we establish some vanishing results other than the ones in Section 2. Theorem [\ref=hn-1vanish] and Theorem [\ref=fiberrelativekvv] are the main results in this section. Theorem [\ref=hn-1vanish] follows from a fundamental inductive argument. Theorem [\ref=fiberrelativekvv] follows from the same argument as Section 2.

First, we consider a generalization of Proposition [\ref=h2vanishing].

Let X be an n-dimensional smooth projective variety with n  ≥  1. Let F be a coherent sheaf on X. Let N be a nef [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Then there exists a positive real number r(F,N) such that

[formula]

for every positive real number r  ≥  r(F,N) and for every nef [formula]-divisor N' such that rN + N' is a [formula]-divisor.

By the same argument as Theorem [\ref=h2vanishing], we may assume that F = :L is an invertible sheaf. We prove the assertion by the induction on n =  dim X. If n = 1, then the assertion is obvious. Thus, we assume n > 1. Let H be a smooth hyperplane section. Consider the exact sequence:

[formula]

By the hypothesis of the induction, Hn - 1(H,OH(L + rN + N' + H)) vanishes. For the vanishing of Hn(X,OX(L + rN + N' + H)), replacing H by a large multiple, we can apply the Fujita vanishing theorem. This is what we want to show.

Second, we consider a generalization of the Kawamata-Viehweg type vanishing theorem (Theorem [\ref=kvvtype]).

Let X be an n-dimensional smooth projective variety with n  ≥  2. Let B be a nef and big [formula]-divisor whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Let N be a nef [formula]-divisor with ν(X,N)  ≥  1. Then there exists a positive real number r(B,N) such that

[formula]

for every positive integer r  ≥  r(B,N) and for every nef [formula]-divisor N' such that rN + N' is a [formula]-divisor.

If n = 2, then we obtain the assertion by Theorem [\ref=kvvtype]. Then, the assertion follows from the same inductive argument as the proof of Theorem [\ref=hnvanish].

Next, let us recall the following known result.

Let π:X  →  S be a morphism from a proper variety X to a projective variety S. Let AS be an ample Cartier divisor on S and let N: = π*AS. Let F be a coherent sheaf on X. Set fmax: =  max s∈S dim π- 1(s).

If i  ≥  fmax + 1, then

[formula]

for an arbitrary integer m  ≫  0.

Consider the Leray spectral sequence

[formula]

Since

[formula]

by Serre vanishing, we have Ei,j2 = 0 for i > 0 and m  ≫  0. Thus we obtain E0,j2 = Ej for m  ≫  0. If j  ≥  fmax + 1, then E0,j2 = 0.

By the same argument as Section 2, we obtain the following vanishing result.

Let π:X  →  S be a morphism from a smooth projective variety X to a projective variety S. Let A be a π-ample [formula]-divisor on X whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Let AS be an ample Cartier divisor on S and let N: = π*AS. Set fmax: =  max s∈S dim π- 1(s).

If i  ≥  fmax, then

[formula]

for an arbitrary integer m  ≫  0.

If i  ≥  fmax, then

[formula]

By the usual spectral sequence argument, (2) follows from (1). Thus we only prove (1). By the assumption, we may assume that A is an ample [formula]-divisor whose fractional part is simple normal crossing. Moreover, by Proposition [\ref=cycliccover], we may assume that A is an ample [formula]-divisor. Then, the assertion follows from the same arguments as Proposition [\ref=h1proto] by using Proposition [\ref=fiberserrevanish] instead of Proposition [\ref=h2vanishing].

Examples in dimension three

It is natural to consider the following question.

Unfortunately, the answer is NO. In this section, we construct counter-examples.

There exists a smooth projective 3-fold X, a coherent sheaf F and a semi-ample and big [formula]-divisor B which satisfy the following property.

There exists a positive integer m0 such that for an arbitrary integer m  ≥  m0

[formula]

Let X0 be an arbitrary smooth projective 3-fold and let x0∈X0 be an arbitrary point. Let f:X  →  X0 be the blowup at x0. Let E be the exceptional divisor and let B: = f*A0 where A0 is an ample [formula]-divisor on X0. We define F by

[formula]

Consider the exact sequence:

[formula]

H3(X,OX(KX + mB)) vanishes for an arbitrary large integer m  ≫  0 by Proposition [\ref=hnvanish]. Consider H2(E,OE(KE + mB)). Since B = f*(A) and f(E) is one point, we have

[formula]

for an arbitrary integer [formula]. These mean

[formula]

for an arbitrary large integer m  ≫  0. This is what we want to show.

In the construction of the following three examples, we use a counter-example to the Kodaira vanishing theorem (cf. [\cite=Raynaud]).

There exists a smooth projective 3-fold X, an ample [formula]-divisor A and a semi-ample [formula]-divisor N with ν(X,N) = 1 which satisfy the following property.

There exists a positive integer m0 such that for an arbitrary integer m  ≥  m0

[formula]

Let Z be a smooth projective surface and let AZ be an ample [formula]-divisor such that

[formula]

Let C be an arbitrary smooth projective curve. Set X: = Z  ×  C and let πZ and πC be their projections respectively. Take two distinct points c0∈C and c1∈C and let Z0: = Z  ×  {c0} and Z1: = Z  ×  {c1}. Note that Z0≃Z and Z1≃Z. Since c0 and c1 are ample [formula]-divisors on C,

[formula]

are ample [formula]-divisors on X. We show

[formula]

for an arbitrary integer m  ≫  0. Consider the exact sequence:

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=hn-1vanish], H2(X,OX(KX + A - Z0 + mZ1)) vanishes for an arbitrary large integer m  ≫  0. Let us calculate H1(Z0,OZ0(KX + A + mZ1)). By [formula], we see

[formula]

for an arbitrary integer [formula] These mean

[formula]

for m  ≫  0. This is what we want to show.

There exists a smooth projective 3-fold X, an ample [formula]-divisor A and a semi-ample and big [formula]-divisor B which satisfy the following property.

There exists a positive integer m0 such that for an arbitrary integer m  ≥  m0

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=cycliccover] and Step 1 in the proof of Theorem [\ref=kvvtype], it is sufficient that we construct

[formula]

for an ample [formula]-divisor A and a simple normal crossing [formula]-divisor Δ such that 0  ≤  Δ  ≤  1 and that Δ + A is a [formula]-divisor.

Let [formula] be a smooth projective surface and let AZ be an ample [formula]-divisor such that

[formula]

Let [formula] be the projective cone over Z and let f:X  →  Y be the blowup of the vertex of Y.

Then, by [\cite=Hartshorne], we see that [formula] Let π:X  →  Z be the natural projection and let OX(1) be the canonically defined π-ample invertible sheaf. Let Z0 and Z1 be the sections defined by the following surjections respectively

[formula]

[formula]

By the definition of Z0 and Z1, we have OX(1)|Z0  =  OZ0 and OX(1)|Z1  =  OZ1(1) where OZ1(1) is a very ample invertible sheaf defined by Z≃Z1 and OZ(1). By the same argument as [\cite=Hartshorne], we see OX(Z1)≃OX(1). Moreover, by a direct calculation, we see that Z0 is the exceptional locus of f. (See [\cite=Hartshorne].) Note that Z0 and Z1 are disjoint because OX(1)|Z0  =  OZ0.

We fix a small positive rational number [formula] such that the [formula]-divisor

[formula]

is ample. Set

[formula]

Note that Δ + A is a [formula]-divisor. Let AY be an ample invertible sheaf on Y and let

[formula]

Consider the exact sequence:

[formula]

First let us calculate H2(X,OX(KX  +  Δ + A + mB - Z0)):

[formula]

for an arbitrary large integer m  ≫  0 by Theorem [\ref=hn-1vanish]. Second let us calculate H1(Z0,OZ0(KX  +  Δ + A + mB)). Since f(Z0) is one point, we see

[formula]

for an arbitrary integer [formula] By Z0≃Z, we see

[formula]

Therefore we obtain

[formula]

for an arbitrary large integer m  ≫  0. This is what we want to show.

There exists a smooth projective 3-fold W, an ample [formula]-divisor AW and a semi-ample [formula]-divisor NW with ν(W,NW) = 2 which satisfy the following property.

There exists a positive integer m0 such that for an arbitrary integer m  ≥  m0

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=cycliccover] and Step 1 in the proof of Theorem [\ref=kvvtype], it is sufficient that we construct

[formula]

for an ample [formula]-divisor AW and a simple normal crossing [formula]-divisor ΔW such that 0  ≤  ΔW  ≤  1 and that ΔW + AW is a [formula]-divisor.

We use the same notations [formula] as Example [\ref=cexnu=3]. Let y0∈Y be the vertex as a projective cone. There exists a finite morphism [formula] Fix an open dense subset [formula] such that [formula] Take an arbitrary projection [formula] and fix its projectivication [formula]. Now, we have the following morphisms

[formula]

Here, by considering the composition of the above dominant rational maps, we obtain a dominant rational map [formula]. Note that this is a morphism on [formula]. By its construction, we see [formula] since f(Z0) = y0. By taking a log resolution of indeterminacy h:W  →  X, we obtain a surjective morphism l:W  →  P from a smooth projective 3-fold W such that [formula] and [formula] is simple normal crossing (cf. [\cite=CP]). Then h:h- 1(Z0)  →  Z0 is an isomorphism and let ZW: = h- 1(Z0). Let

[formula]

be an ample [formula]-divisor on W where E is an h-exceptional [formula]-divisor with 0  ≤  E < 1. Note that we can find such a divisor E by [\cite=KM]. Let

[formula]

Since [formula] is disjoint from ZW we see that

[formula]

Let AP be an ample [formula]-divisor on P and let

[formula]

Consider the exact sequence:

[formula]

Then by the same calculation as Example [\ref=cexnu=3], we obtain the desired result.
