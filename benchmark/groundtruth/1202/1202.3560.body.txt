INTRODUCTION

The Siegel upper half plane of degree g, usually denoted [formula], is defined as the space of g  ×  g complex, symmetric matrices whose imaginary part is positive definite. The modular group of dimension 2g is the group of 2g  ×  2g symplectic matrices whose entries are integer numbers. We will denote it by the symbol [formula]. There exists a well-known action of the modular group on the Siegel upper half plane, the so called modular action: To every matrix and every point [formula] of [formula] it associates Now, let g and n be positive integers such that for some non-negative integer p. Let us define the space where the matrix V is given by Let us also introduce the group where T denotes the 2g  ×  2g matrix The modular action can be restricted to an action of [formula] on the space Wg,n: for every matrix and every point one has that We wish to address the problem of a fundamental domain for this action of the group [formula] on the space Wg,n. Its definition is recalled here below:

We say that two points [formula] and [formula] of Wg,n are equivalent if there exists [formula] such that A fundamental domain for [formula] is a closed subset D of Wg,n whose interior part is connected, which satisfies the following three properties:

The case in which n equals g + 1 is easily reconducted to the Reduction Theory of positive definite quadratic forms and was already studied by several mathematicians from the last century. (The first achievements in a general treatment of this topic are due to Minkowski [\cite=Minkowski]; see [\cite=Ryshkov] for an account on more recent results.) In this article we solve the problem when g  =  2g0 is an even number, and n equals one. In this case, the space W2g0,1 has the following simple characterization: For the group [formula], instead, one has

[formula]

It is understood that the matrices A,B,C,D,E,F,G and H belong to [formula].

Our main motivation in considering this problem comes from the theory of real Riemann surfaces (see [\cite=Cirre] and [\cite=Fay] for a complete account of this subject). A compact Riemann surface Γ of genus g is said to be real or symmetric when it is endowed with an anti-holomorphic involution r. One can consider the locus of points which are invariant with respect to r. Its connected components are at most g + 1 and they are usually called the ovals of the surface. When Γ with this locus removed has two connected components, it is said to be separated. Let this be the case, and assume that the number of ovals is n. Then it is possible to fix a basis in the homology of the form

[formula]

satisfying the following conditions:

[formula]

for every [formula] and every [formula], the intersection number of any two other elements of the basis being zero.

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the morphism of the homology into itself induced by r.

Given any Riemann surface (not necessrily a real one) with a fixed basis in the homology B, one can compute the corresponding period matrix. This is a point in the Siegel upper half plane (see [\cite=Siegel_II] and [\cite=Fay] for more details). Any other basis in the homology [formula] on the same surface can be expressed in terms of the cycles of B by means of a modular matrix. If this is blockwise written as then the corresponding period matrices [formula] and [formula] are related by the modular transformation Now, in the case of a real Riemann surface with a basis B of the form ([\ref=Intro_1]-[\ref=Intro_3]), the period matrix belongs to the space Wg,n. Moreover, the changes of basis in the homology which preserve the form ([\ref=Intro_1]-[\ref=Intro_3]) are exactly the ones given by matrices of [formula]. Real Riemann surfaces were extensively applied in the theory of integrable systems (see [\cite=Matveev]). In [\cite=Dubrovin-Segur], the solution of our problem in one particular case was successfully applied to the study of the parameter space of algebro-geometric solutions of the KP-2 equation.

As we have already said, in this paper we formulate a general procedure to determine a fundamental domain for the modular action of the group [formula] on the space W2g0,1. We briefly sketch our methods and results here below: Our first step consists in a reformulation of the problem (Section [\ref=sez:Reformulation]). Let us denote with [formula] the group of all g-dimensional, unimodular matrices with integer entries. Let us also introduce the space [formula] of all real symmetric and positive definite matrices of dimension g. The congruent action

[formula]

is defined as follows

[formula]

The modular and the congruent actions are closely related by a result of Siegel's (Theorem [\ref=teo_Siegel]): There exists an injective and smooth map such that the following diagram is commutative for every G belonging to [formula]

[formula]

Let us define the space The congruent action can be restricted to an action of the group [formula] on S2g0,1. Now, let [formula] be a fundamental domain for this last one, and put Using Siegel's result one can show that the set D so defined is a fundamental domain for the modular action restricted to [formula] and W2g0,1. The original issue can then be reformulated as the quest of such a [formula]. The main technical tool to tackle this new problem is the map [formula], introduced in Section [\ref=sez:ReductionToolkit]. Due to its several remarkable properties this might turn out to be of general interest by itself, beyond its role in this specific context. To the best of our knowledge, this map was never considered in the literature before. The domain of [formula] is the set of all 4g0-dimensional, real and symplectic matrices of the form Both S2g0,1 and [formula] are contained in it. Its explicit definition is very simple: After this, [formula] turns out to be a bijection onto [formula], the space of all real and invertible matrices of dimension 2g0. It maps S2g0,1 onto [formula]. Moreover [formula] respects both the matrix product and transposition. As a consequence the following diagram is commutative for every G belonging to [formula]:

[formula]

This construction allows a further reformulation of the problem, in the same spirit as above: Let us consider the group [formula] defined as This is a finite-index subgroup of [formula]. Obviously, the congruent action can be restricted to an action of [formula] on [formula]; let [formula] be a fundamental domain for it. Due to the properties of [formula] the set [formula] defined as turns out to be a fundamental domain for the congruent action restricted to [formula] and S2g0,1. The original problem is then equivalent to the quest of such a [formula]. This second reformulation appears in Section [\ref=sez:Reduction]. It is given the name of Reduction of the Problem because it halves, so to say, the dimension of the matrices involved in the issue. The advantage of these subsequent reformulations is that we finally get to an explicitly solvable problem. Indeed, the Minkowski Reduction Theory provides us with a fundamental domain for the congruent action of the whole group [formula] on [formula]. On the other side, the index of [formula] in [formula] is finite. In view of these two facts, a fundamental domain [formula] for the congruent action of [formula] on [formula] can be computed by means of standard "gluing" techniques.

The case in which 2g0 equals 2 is particularly interesting (Section [\ref=sez:CaseGenusTwo]). It exhibits the remarkable peculiarity that the group [formula] coincides with the whole [formula]. As a consequence, the two reformulations above reconduct the original problem to a classical one already solved: the reduction of positive definite binary quadratic forms. No usage of "gluing" techniques is required in this case. The formulas expressing the result are very simple: Let us denote by

[formula]

the generic element of W2,1; a fundamental domain D for the modular action [formula] of the group [formula] on this last one is given by the following system of inequalities:

[formula]

Moreover, a deeper understanding of the mathematical structure is possible in this case: Let G belong to [formula]. One has that either

[formula]

or

[formula]

Introduce, on W2,1, the new system of coordinates Now consider a modular transformation In the new coordinates it acts as follows: and if G has the form ([\ref=primo_tipo]), or if ([\ref=secondo_tipo]) holds, instead. In other words, we find out that I is an invariant quantity: it is not affected by the modular action of [formula], which concentrates only on the second coordinate [formula]. This last one just undergoes a Moebius transformation, in some cases composed with a complex conjugation. The theory developed in Sections [\ref=sez:Reformulation] and [\ref=sez:ReductionToolkit] allowed us to individuate the higher dimensional analogue of the invariant quantity I and to prove that also in this case it is not affected by the modular action of [formula] (Section [\ref=sez:Reduction]). A full understanding of the geometrical meaning of this quantity has not yet been achieved though, and it is meant to be part of a work in progress. Finally, the explicit calculation of a fundamental domain has been worked out in the case when 2g0 equals 4. The result is not so simple to write down; a rather detailed account of the formulas there involved can be found in Section [\ref=sez:GeneralCase]. Since completing this paper, we have noted that some of the results of Section [\ref=sez:CaseGenusTwo] are closely related to the ones presented in [\cite=Silhol]. This connection is discussed at the end of Section [\ref=sez:GeneralCase].

REFORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

In this section we show how the original problem can be refomulated in terms of a restriction of the congruent action [formula], introduced in ([\ref=def_cong_1]-[\ref=def_cong_2]). For every matrix belonging to the Siegel upper half plane of degree g, let us define

[formula]

This map already appeared in Siegel's investigations on the modular group, from which we drew some inspiration. It relates the modular and the congruent actions:

[formula] is a bijection onto the space of all real, symmetric and positive definite matrices of dimension 2g which are also symplectic.

For every G belonging to the modular group, the following diagram is commutative:

[formula]

For a proof see [\cite=Siegel_III], pag. 148, theorem 1. Now, since the original problem is concerned with the proper subset [formula], let us introduce the space In view of point [formula] of theorem [\ref=teo_Siegel], it is easy to realize that [formula] can be restricted to an action of the group [formula] on S2g0,1. Moreover the following diagram is commutative, for every G belonging to [formula]:

[formula]

This immediately gives the following

Let [formula] be a fundamental domain for the congruent action of the group [formula] on S2g0,1. Then the set is a fundamental domain for the modular action of the same group [formula] on W2g0,1.

In view of this, the original problem is equivalent to the quest of such a [formula]. To this purpose, a more explicit characterization of S2g0,1 will be useful:

The set S2g0,1 consists of all real, symplectic, symmetric and positive definite matrices Σ of dimension 4g0, which have the following form

[formula]

for some α,β,γ,δ,ξη belonging to [formula].

In view of theorem [\ref=teo_Siegel], point [formula], it will be sufficient to prove that a matrix [formula] of the Siegel upper half plane belongs to W2g0,1 if and only if its image [formula] has the form ([\ref=forma_Sigma]). This last condition is equivalent to the relation

[formula]

where

[formula]

Using the explicit definition ([\ref=def_Sigma]), one can show that ([\ref=equa:Riform_2]) holds if and only if the following relations do: But this happens if and only if [formula] belongs to W2g0,1, so the proof is complete.

Next sections will be dedicated to determine a fundamental domain [formula] for the congruent action of [formula] on S2g0,1.

REDUCTION TOOLKIT

In this section we introduce some objects which will be, so to say, useful tools in our task. Let us start with an auxiliary map. Consider the vector space It is understood that the matrices α,β,γ,δ,π,ρ,ξ and η belong to [formula]. We define the map as follows:

[formula]

Let us also introduce the notation for the standard symplectic matrix. Its dimension will be clear from the context.

Let Σ and [formula] belong to V2g0,1 and put One has the following:

Points [formula] and [formula] can be verified by means of a straightforward calculation.

hold true for every column vector , belonging to [formula]. This implies that if Σ is positive definite, then also σ and τ are. Viceversa, the quadratic form given by Σ can be expressed in terms of the quadratic forms corresponding to σ and τ in the following way: So, if both σ and τ are positive definite, then also Σ is.

Let us introduce the group It is understood that the matrices α,β,γ,δ,π,ρ,ξ and η belong to [formula]. Notice that both [formula] and S2g0,1 are contained in it. Let us also define as follows: Many properties of this map can be deduced from lemma [\ref=lemma:RedTool_1]:

The map [formula] is a homeomorphism from 2g0,1 to [formula], this last one consisting of all real invertible matrices of dimension 2g0. Moreover it respects both matrix product and transposition

The inverse of [formula] is the map defined as follows: Notice that the image of [formula] is contained in 2g0,1 because of point [formula] of the lemma. Since both [formula] and [formula] are continuous, this last one is a homeomorphism. Moreover [formula] respects both matrix product and transposition due to point [formula] and [formula] of the lemma.

The map [formula] restricts to a homeomorphism from S2g0,1 to [formula].

From point [formula] of lemma [\ref=lemma:RedTool_1], one immediately has that Viceversa, let σ belong to [formula]. The matrix is also positive definite. From the proof of the previous corollary, we know that In view of point [formula] of the lemma, this last matrix is also positive definite and so it belongs to S2g0,1. It follows that and the proof is complete.

Finally let us introduce the group One has the following

The map [formula] restricts to an isomorphism of groups from [formula] to [formula].

Let G belong to [formula] and put From point [formula] of the lemma, one has that

[formula]

Since both σ and τ have integer coefficients, this implies that Equation ([\ref=equa:RedTool_10]) can be rewritten as follows:

[formula]

On the other side, from definition ([\ref=equa:RedTool_01]) one has that

[formula]

for some [formula] belonging to [formula], in this case. Plugging ([\ref=equa:RedTool_30]) into ([\ref=equa:RedTool_20]) one obtains that for some M belonging to [formula]. Viceversa, let g belong to [formula]. Let us put

[formula]

From the proof of corollary [\ref=coro:RedTool_1] we know that

[formula]

Recalling the definition of [formula] one can easily write

[formula]

Now, since for some M belonging to [formula], one also has that

[formula]

for some [formula] belonging to [formula]. Since g has an inverse with integer entries, it follows immediately that

[formula]

for some Ñ belonging to [formula]. Equations ([\ref=equa:RedTool_50]) together with ([\ref=equa:RedTool_60]) and ([\ref=equa:RedTool_70]) imply that [formula] has integer coefficients. So it belongs to [formula].

The whole modular group [formula] is contained in [formula]. For every matrix one has that It is easy to show that the argument of the function [formula] in the left-hand side belongs to [formula]. Since the following inclusion also holds: For every one has that and the argument of [formula] again belongs to [formula].

REDUCTION OF THE PROBLEM

We can now reformulate further the original problem, using the instruments developed in the previous section. This process bears the name of reduction because it halves the dimension of the matrices involved in the issue.

The following diagram

[formula]

is commutative for every G belonging to [formula].

Let Σ and G belong to S2g0,1 and [formula] respectively. Due to corollary [\ref=coro:RedTool_1] one has On the other side, simply by definition,

As a consequence, one has the following

Let [formula] be a fundamental domain for the congruent action of [formula] on [formula]. Then the set is a fundamental domain for the congruent action of [formula] on S2g0,1.

The proof is a standard argument based on proposition [\ref=prop:RedProb_1] and corollaries [\ref=coro:RedTool_2] and [\ref=coro:RedTool_3].

The original problem is thus equivalent to the quest of such a [formula]. The remaining sections will be dedicated to this issue. This will also emphasize the full advantage of our approach. Another consequence of proposition [\ref=prop:RedProb_1] is worth pointing out: For every [formula] belonging to W2g0,1, let us define

[formula]

Let [formula] and G belong to W2g0,1 and [formula] respectively. Consider the modular transformation One has

In view of commutative diagram ([\ref=diag_comm_intro_1]), Taking the image via [formula] of both sides, and applying proposition [\ref=prop:RedProb_1] Considering the determinants, and recalling the explicit definition ([\ref=def_cong_2]), The thesis follows from this last equation, in view of the fact that [formula] is contained in [formula].

From corollary [\ref=coro:RedTool_2], one has As a consequence, the quantity I is not constant over the whole W2g0,1. In other words, it is not a trivial invariant with respect to the modular action [formula] of the group [formula]. To the best of our understanding, no geometrical interpretation of this quantity is available so far.

THE CASE 2g0 = 2

We start here to put in concrete action the previously developed abstract theory. The simplest case when 2g0 equals 2 allows an elegant solution, together with a deeper understanding of the structure of the problem.

One has

[formula]

Moreover, if G belongs to [formula], there are only two possible cases: either

[formula]

or

[formula]

As pointed out in remark [\ref=rem:RedTool_1], one has the following inclusions: On the other side, This gives ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_1]). Now, let G belong to [formula]. Then, either or More explicitly, one has

[formula]

in the former case, and

[formula]

in the latter one. Always in view of remark [\ref=rem:RedTool_1], ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_4]) and ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_5]) yield ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_2]) and ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_3]) respectively.

The explicit characterization of the group [formula] given in the previous lemma can also be obtained by a direct calculation, starting from ([\ref=equa:Intro_1])

By means of ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_1]) we are reconducted to a classical problem whose solution is well-known: Let us indicate with

[formula]

the generic element of [formula]. A fundamental domain [formula] for the congruent action of the group [formula] on this space is described by the following system of inequalities

[formula]

This result was already known to Lagrange and Hermite. Let us denote with

[formula]

the generic element of W2,1. The imaginary part of [formula] is positive definite if and only if For the map [formula] defined in ([\ref=def_Sigma]) one has the following explicit expression: Applying [formula] to both sides of this equality, one gets

[formula]

These simple facts, together with the results of the previous sections, suffice to prove the following

A fundamental domain D for the modular action [formula] of the group [formula] over W2,1 is described by the following system of inequalities:

[formula]

Due to corollaries [\ref=coro:RedProb_1] and [\ref=coro:Reform_1], such a fundamental domain D can be found by simply considering In view of ([\ref=composta_esplicita]), one gets an explicit description of this set operating the substitution into the system ([\ref=Lagrange]). This leads to ([\ref=Risultato_g2]).

With this result, the original problem can be considered completely solved when 2g0 equals 2. The theory developed up to now, though, allows a deeper insight into the structure of the modular action of [formula] on W2,1.

Let us introduce the following system of coordinates on the space W2,1:

[formula]

The square root is chosen to be positive. Consider the modular transformation given by an element of [formula]:

[formula]

In terms of the new coordinates, this acts as follows:

[formula]

and

[formula]

if G has the form ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_2]), while

[formula]

if ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_3]) holds.

The explicit expression for [formula] in ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_10]) agrees with its general definition given in section [\ref=sez:Reduction]. To see this it is sufficient to plug ([\ref=composta_esplicita]) into ([\ref=equa:RedProb_100]). Formula ([\ref=gia_fatta]) is just the content of corollary [formula]. Gluing together ([\ref=diag_comm_intro_1]) and ([\ref=diag_comm_CR]) one gets the following commutative diagram:

[formula]

Let us introduce where the square root is again chosen to be positive. Using ([\ref=incollato]) one can write

[formula]

In view of definition ([\ref=equa:RedProb_100]), one has that This means that [formula] is not only symmetric and positive definite but also symplectic for every [formula] belonging to W2,1. As a consequence of theorem [\ref=teo_Siegel], then, there exists a unique point [formula] in the Siegel upper half plane of degree one such that Using ([\ref=def_Sigma]),([\ref=composta_esplicita]) and ([\ref=equa:RedProb_100]) one can verify that this definition of [formula] coincides with the more explicit one given in ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_10]). Now, suppose that G has the form ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_2]). In this case, By point [formula] of theorem [\ref=teo_Siegel], ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_110]) gives ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_20]). Let G have the form ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_3]), instead. One has that Equation ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_110]) can be rewritten as follows:

[formula]

By means of ([\ref=def_Sigma]), one can verify that Again by point [formula] of theorem [\ref=teo_Siegel] equality ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_40]) implies ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_30])

Consider the modular transformation associated to an element of [formula], like the one in ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_100]). One has

The explicit expression for [formula] given in ([\ref=equa:GenTwo_10]) implies that On the other side, in view of ([\ref=gia_fatta]) one has It follows that

THE GENERAL CASE

At the beginning of the last century Minkowski studied the congruent action of [formula] on [formula]: he exhibited, for every n  ≥  2, a fundamental domain M which can be described by a finite set of inequalities

[formula]

where [formula] are linear homogeneous expressions of the entries of σ. For low dimensions these expressions were explicitly determined: see [\cite=Barnes-Cohn] and [\cite=Ryshkov]. After considerations of the previous sections, we now need a fundamental domain for the congruent action, on [formula], of the group [formula], which is strictly contained in [formula] for 2g0  ≥  4. The index of this subgroup is finite. It can be easily computed and it equals (this is an advantage of the reduction procedure). In similar situations, a standard technique seems to be the following one:

Select a representantive for each left coset of [formula] in [formula].

Act with each representantive on the Minkowski fundamental domain M and consider the union of all the sets obtained this way.

If its interior part is connected, this union is a fundamental domain for [formula].

As we are not aware of any reference for the theoretical justification of this procedure, we formulate one suitable for this setting here below

Let g be an element of [formula]. The symbol [formula] will denote the map defined as follows

Let σ be an interior point of M, and [formula] such that [formula]. Then g  =    ±  Id.

By definition of fundamental domain, if [formula] then Now, let [formula] be a neighborhood of σ contained in M. Due to the continuity of the map [formula] there exists a neighborhood of σ, say σ, such that Let us put [formula]. The points of Bσ are all interior to M and remain inside M when the map [formula] is applied, so one has But Bσ is an open subset of [formula] and [formula] is a linear map, so This implies that g  =    ±  Id.

Let σ∈M. Every neighborhood of σ contains interior points of M.

This is a direct consequence of the fact that M is a convex set with non-empty interior.

Let σ be an interior point of for some [formula] and let [formula] satisfy for some ρ∈M. Then

Let Bσ be a neighborhood of σ contained in [formula], and let Bρ be a neighborhood of ρ such that (such a neighborhood exists due to continuity of the map [formula]). Let ν be an interior point of M contained in Bρ; then that is which is equivalent to From this, applying lemma [formula] one gets

Let us consider the left cosets of [formula] in [formula] and fix a representative for each of them: If

[formula]

is a connected set then is a fundamental domain for the congruent action of [formula] on [formula].

The nontrivial part of the proof is the verification of point [formula] of definition [formula]. Let ρ be an interior point of [formula] and σ belong to [formula]; also suppose that

[formula]

for some [formula]. This relation can be rewritten as where [formula] belongs to M. Applying lemma [\ref=lem_terzo_cinque] one gets that is Now, if k = 1 then g  =    ±  Id and σ  =  ρ. If k  ≠  1, instead, g does not belong to [formula], because by construction g1 and gk belong to different cosets. In the same way, one can treat the case in which σ belongs to [formula] for [formula] and finally prove that ρ cannot be equivalent (in the [formula]-sense) to any other point of [formula].

At this point, the issue is about selecting a set of representatives such that the set in ([\ref=Unione]) is connected. Next lemma gives a working criterion to individuate some identifications on the border of M which will serve as "building blocks" in this task.

Let [formula]. Let us assume that there exists a point ρ0∈M with the following two properties:

There exists an integer kρ such that

Let us put [formula]; there exists an integer kσ such that (In particular, σ0 belongs to M.)

Then the set is connected.

There exists an open ball Bρ0 with center in ρ0 such that every ρ belonging to Bρ0 satisfies If the radius of Bρ0 is sufficiently small, its image through [formula], say Bσ0, has the analogous property: every σ belonging to [formula] satisfies Let Bρ0 satisfy both properties above, and define the following three sets:

[formula]

Analogously we define B+σ0, B-σ0 and B0σ0. Consider ρ∈B0ρ0. Suppose that Then [formula] belongs to the interior of M and is equivalent to another point of M, which is absurd. Suppose instead that and put ρ  =  ρ0  +  ν. Then ρ0  -  ν still belongs to B0ρ0 and one easily proves that which again is absurd. It follows that This implies that there are only two possibilities:

[formula]

Since both B+ρ0 and B+σ0 are open sets contained in the interior of M, the first of ([\ref=two_poss]) can occur only in the trivial case g  =    ±  Id. In all other cases, then, B-σ0 is contained in [formula] and

[formula]

The thesis now follows from ([\ref=punto]) by means of standard arguments of general topology.

Suppose now that the matrices all satisfy the hypotheses of lemma [\ref=lemma_quarto_cinque]. More generally one can consider finite collections of matrices of the form

[formula]

where [formula]. One can prove that also in this case the set is connected. It is possible to use this simple fact to try to determine algorithmically a set of matrices of [formula] which satisfies the hypotheses of proposition [\ref=proposizione_prima_cinque]. We report an example here below.

The case 2g0 = 4

Let us denote by the generic real, symmetric and positive definite matrix of dimension 4. A fundamental domain M for the congruent action of [formula] on [formula] can be obtained by imposing the following conditions:

for every

the index q in the right-hand side of ([\ref=Tonio]) depending on [formula] as follows:

This explicit result is due to E.S. Barnes and M.J. Cohn (see [\cite=Barnes-Cohn]). We used it to determine a fundamental domain [formula] for the congruent action of [formula] on [formula]. Our calculations are summarized here below.

Let σ belong to M. Assume that equality holds in ([\ref=Tonio]) for some vector [formula] of the form ([\ref=def_insieme_m]). Let [formula] be the identity matrix with the q-th column replaced by [formula]. This is an upper triangular element of [formula]. Using the theory of Minkowski it can be proved that [formula] also satisfies conditions [formula] and [formula] above. Considering then an appropriate diagonal matrix d belonging to [formula] one obtains that is equivalent to σ and belongs to M.

By means of this last observation one can easily determine the following elements of [formula]. They all satisfy the hypotheses of lemma [\ref=lemma_quarto_cinque].

[formula]

This can be verified considering for each matrix above the corresponding point of M from the list below:

[formula]

[formula]

A set of elements of [formula] satisfying the hypotheses of proposition [\ref=proposizione_prima_cinque] is the following:

[formula]

Indeed, by means of a computer it is easy to verify that no two such matrices belong to the same left coset and, for what we observed above, the index of [formula] in [formula] is 28; so this list is composed of exactly one representantive for each left coset. Moreover, ([\ref=tutti_definitivi]) is the union of families of the type ([\ref=famiglia]); thus it gives place to a set whose interior is connected. We emphasize our final result in the following

A fundamental domain [formula] for the congruent action of [formula] on [formula] is given by where the matrices gj are listed in ([\ref=tutti_definitivi]).

Discussion

The method presented here works, in principle, when 2g0 is an arbitrary positive and even integer but it requires the explicit description of the Minkowski fundamental domain M. Such a description, though not completely non-redundant, is available for 2g0 = 6 (see [\cite=Ryshkov]); it would be interesting to try to work out the calculations in this case, with a more systematic use of a computer. To the best of our knowledge, no explicit description of M is yet available when 2g0 is equal or larger than 8. As already mentioned in the Introduction, the problem of finding a canonical form for period matrices of real Riemann Surfaces was not first studied in this article. In [\cite=Silhol], Silhol proposed a different approach, in which the original problem can be reconducted to the Minkowski problem itself. No restrictions on the group [formula] are necessary while considering its congruent action on [formula]. The fundamental domain found there, though, is not a connected set, as indeed it was prescribed in definition [\ref=def_dom_fond] and as it is in our case. Moreover, in our approach the basis in the homology under consideration all behave in the same way w.r.t. [formula] (this constraint is expressed by formulas ([\ref=Intro_3])). As a consequence, geometrical quantities like periods of abelian differentials exhibit some specific symmetries when computed w.r.t. these basis. This turns out to be a good advantage in the application of our results to the study of algebro-geometric solutions to nonlinear integrable systems.
