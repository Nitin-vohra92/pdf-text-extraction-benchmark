EXAMPLES of FINITELY DETERMINED MAP-GERMS OF CORANK 2 FROM n-SPACE TO (n + 1)-SPACE

Introduction

One of the intriguing problems in Singularity Theory is to relate algebraic properties of holomorphic map-germs with topological properties of the images of their stable perturbations. The image of a stabilisation of a finitely A-determined map-germ from [formula] to [formula] has the homotopy type of a wedge of n-spheres if (n,n + 1) is in the range of Mather's nice dimensions, i.e. n < 15, ([\cite=mond89]) - the existence of stabilisations is not guaranteed outside the nice dimensions; however, a similar statement can be proved for topological stabilisations which exist even for n  ≥  15 ([\cite=damon-mond]). The number of spheres in the wedge is an A-invariant of the map-germ which is called the image Milnor number and denoted by μI. Pellikaan and de Jong (unpublished) then de Jong and van Straten ([\cite=jong-straten]) and later Mond ([\cite=mond89]) proved the following. For any finitely A-determined map-germ f from a surface to 3-space,

[formula]

and with equality if f is weighted homogeneous where [formula] is the dimension of the base of a mini-Ae-versal unfolding of f. A similar result for map-germs from [formula] to [formula] was also proved by Mond ([\cite=mond-bent]). Motivated by these results, Mond suggested the following generalisation.

Let [formula] be a finitely A-determined map-germ. Then

[formula]

and with equality if f is weighted homogeneous and n < 15.

We claim that Conjecture [\ref=conjmond] would follow from the following statement.

Let F be a stable d-parameter unfolding of a finitely A-determined map-germ [formula], and H be the defining equation of the image of F. Assume that [formula] is a germ transverse to F. Then [formula] is a Cohen-Macaulay module of dimension 1.

Our claim is motivated by Damon and Mond's work [\cite=damon-mond] where they proved a phenomenon similar to ([\ref=mui]) for holomorphic map-germs [formula] where (n,p) are nice dimensions and n  ≥  p. For a finitely A-determined map-germ in these dimensions, the discriminant of a stabilisation intersected with a Milnor ball about the origin has the homotopy type of a wedge of (p - 1)-dimensional spheres ([\cite=damon-mond]). The number μΔ of spheres in the wedge is called the discriminant Milnor number. The main result is that

[formula]

and with equality if f is weighted homogeneous.

Here we run through the main steps of the proof of ([\ref=mudelta]) to clarify Conjecture [\ref=ngcm]. Consider [formula] as a pullback of a stable d-parameter unfolding F by an immersion [formula] transverse to F. Assume that the discriminant V of F is defined by some [formula]. For any 1-parameter deformation G(,t) = (gt(),t) of g, [formula] is a Cohen-Macaulay module of dimension 1. This is deduced from the fact that V is a free divisor ([\cite=damon-mond]). Consequently, KH-equivalence has a free deformation theory; that is,

[formula]

([\cite=damon-mond]). Now, if [formula] is such that gt()∈V, then

[formula]

since ft is stable. Let [formula] and Jht be the Jacobian ideal of ht. If gt()∉V

[formula]

is an isomorphism ([\cite=damon-mond]). So the only contribution to the KH,e-dimension of g comes from the points [formula] with gt()∉V. The sum of the Milnor numbers [formula] over all such [formula] is equal to μΔ(f). Hence one gets ([\ref=mudelta]).

When p = n + 1, the discriminant coincides with the image of the map-germ. Furthermore, Damon and Mond's argument would prove Conjecture [\ref=conjmond] if Conjecture [\ref=ngcm] held.

A classification of finitely A-determined map-germs can be pursued as an alternative way to attack Conjecture [\ref=conjmond]. However, as the dimension and the corank gets higher, classifying such map-germs or even finding examples becomes a difficult task.

In this paper, we focus on finding new examples of finitely A-determined corank ≥  2 map-germs in order to test Conjecture [\ref=conjmond]. It is not our aim to obtain a classification. In [\cite=houston-kirk], Houston and Kirk gave a classification of map-germs of corank 1 from [formula] to [formula] with the strata of Ae-codimension ≤  4, and showed that all the examples in their list satisfy the conjecture. We start with the next interesting case: finitely A-determined map-germs of corank 2 in the dimensions (3,4). In Section [\ref=geometric], we give a list of examples which were found by experiment.

In Section [\ref=examples], we study finite A-determinacy of 1-parameter unfoldings defined by a base change operation on stable unfoldings; namely, augmentations. In [\cite=cooper], Cooper defined the augmentation of a finite map-germ [formula] of Ae-codimension 1 to be AF:(λ,)  ↦  (λ,(λ2,)) where F(u,): = (u,(u,)) is an Ae-versal unfolding of f and [formula] (n < p). In [\cite=houston-aug], Houston considered augmentations given by AF,h(f):(,)  ↦  (,(h(),)) where [formula] is a germ of a holomorphic function and [formula] need not be Ae-versal. In this paper, we introduce a different type of augmentations. We let F be a d-parameter stable unfolding of f and [formula] a germ of a curve. Then we define the augmentation of f by F and γ to be the map-germ AF,γ(f):(u,)  ↦  (u,(γ(u),)). Our definition coincides with Houston's for d = 1 and with Cooper's for d = 1 and γ(u) = u2.

We prove that an augmentation is finitely A-determined if F is a stable d-parameter unfolding of a finitely A-determined map-germ f and γ intersects the KV-discriminant of the identity map on [formula] only at the origin. We also prove that, for p = n + 1, an augmentation satisfies Conjecture [\ref=ngcm] if, additionally, f does and γ has multiplicity ≥  2. We present series of finitely A-determined map-germs of corank 2 supporting the conjecture in dimensions (4,5) and (5,6). We show that all the map-germs but two in Houston and Kirk's list are augmentations of finitely A-determined map-germs in Mond's classification in [\cite=mondclass].

We use SINGULAR ([\cite=singular]) for our calculations on a computer with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 4 GB memory. The same calculations can be done using other computer algebra programs such as Macaulay2 ([\cite=macaulay]).

Terminology and Notations

Our terminology is standard, but the details can be found in [\cite=wall] or [\cite=martinet]. We denote the space of holomorphic map-germs [formula] by E0n,p. The group [formula] of local diffeomorphisms acts on E0n,p by [formula] for all (φ,ψ)∈A. We say that f,g∈E0n,p are A-equivalent if g∈A  ·  f. A map-germ f∈E0n,p is [formula]-A-determined if every map-germ g∈E0n,p with the same [formula]-jet (at 0) as f is A-equivalent to f. Furthermore, f is finitely A-determined (or A-finite) if it is [formula]-A-determined for some [formula]. A map-germ is A-stable if any of its unfoldings is A-equivalent to the trivial unfolding f  ×  1. By fundamental results of Mather, finite determinacy is equivalent to the finite dimensionality of [formula], and thus (if f is not stable) to [formula] being an isolated point of instability of f. We set [formula].

Following [\cite=damon87], for g∈E0s,p, [formula] and [formula], the normal spaces with respect to KV and KH-equivalences are given respectively by

[formula]

where [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the module of logarithmic vector fields tangent to V (resp. to the level sets of H). To be more precise,

[formula]

in which I(V) is the ideal of germs vanishing on V.

For a d-parameter deformation G of g, the relative normal space is

[formula]

Let [formula] be the standard projection. The KV-discriminant of G is defined to be [formula].

Assume that f∈E0n,p is finite and equals the pullback of a stable unfolding F∈E0n + d,p + d by an immersion g∈E0p,p + d transverse to F. Let V be the image of F and H its defining equation. Then

[formula]

([\cite=mond-diff]). When f is weighted homogeneous, NKV,eg = NKH,eg by Corollary 3.18 of [\cite=damon-mond]).

For a f∈E0n,p with n < p, the corank is the [formula]-vector space dimension of the kernel of [formula]. Let [formula] be the local algebra and [formula] the multiplicity of f.

Examples and non-examples of map-germs from to

The map-germs listed in Table [\ref=tablea] are of corank 2, weighted homogenous and finitely A-determined. The ones labeled as [formula] are a part of the series

[formula]

and [formula] are

[formula]

where α =  - 1 for [formula], α  =    ±  1 for [formula] and α = 1 otherwise. We calculate Ae-codimensions using the identity ([\ref=nak]), and observe that they also satisfy Conjecture [\ref=ngcm]. The data are given for k = 2,3,4 and [formula] because we have been able to get results only for those values of k and [formula] due to computer memory restrictions.

There are no finitely A-determined homogeneous map-germs of corank 2 in E03,4 with degrees (1,2,2,2d), d  ≥  1.

A finite homogeneous map-germ of corank 2 with degrees (1,2,2,2d) is A-equivalent to

[formula]

where [formula] and P2d(x,y,z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2d. Assume that d = 1. Then,

[formula]

with [formula]. A calculation shows that D2(h') is not an isolated singularity whence h' is not finitely A-determined. Now, assume that d  ≥  2. We will show that h forms a line of quadruple points in the image which will imply that it is not A-finite. Let us consider two lines L+:t  ↦  (0,t,αt) and L-:t  ↦  (0,t, - αt) where [formula]. We have

[formula]

Write [formula] where [formula], for all l,m,n. So,

[formula]

Let α1 be a solution of ([\ref=p2deq]). Then

[formula]

whence the result.

Notice that Ae-codimension of our examples are quite high. The smallest codimension we have encountered so far is Ae-codim(Â2) = 18 among the map-germs of corank 2 in these dimensions. It would be very interesting to see if there exist weighted homogeneous map-germs of lower Ae-codimension in the corank 2 case; even more, if there exist any finitely A-determined map-germs of corank 3 in any dimensions.

A new type of augmentation

In this section, we introduce a construction of 1-parameter unfoldings to generate new examples of finitely A-determined map-germs from old.

Let F∈E0n + d,p + d be a d-parameter unfolding of a finite map-germ f∈E0n,p given by [formula] for [formula], and [formula] be a holomorphic map-germ. We define the augmentation AF,γ(f) of f by F and γ to be the map-germ

[formula]

In this setting, we will refer to f as the initial map-germ of AF,γ(f).

Notice that AF,γ(f) is a 1-parameter unfolding of f and its corank equals the corank of f.

Now, we will state a criteria for finite determinacy of augmentations. First, let us fix some notation. Let [formula] and [formula] denote the chosen coordinate systems on [formula] and [formula], respectively. Clearly, we can represent any ξ∈Θ(F) as ξ = (ξ1,ξ2) where ξ1 is the [formula]-component and ξ2 the [formula]-component. So, let [formula] be the standard projection and let us set [formula] which is naturally isomorphic to [formula].

Let F∈E0n + d,p + d be a parametrised stable unfolding of an A-finite f∈E0n,p and V the image of F. Let G be the identity on [formula]. Assume that [formula] is a non-constant map-germ parametrising a curve which intersects DV(G) only at the origin. Then, AF,γ(f) is also A-finite.

Consider AF,γ(f) as a pull-back of F by

[formula]

Notice that ĝ is transverse to F since g:  ↦  (, 0) is. So, [formula]. We will show that the support of NKV,eĝ consists of the origin at most.

We have

[formula]

As [formula] for all [formula],

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

We have So

[formula]

Now, [formula]. Thus,

[formula]

As [formula], ([\ref=supphatg]) is also [formula]. By ([\ref=tanjantg]), [formula] is [formula] or empty; equivalently, AF,γ(f) is A-finite.

We expect that the converse of Theorem [\ref=newex] also holds. We leave this question for further study. We will use the following proposition to check Conjecture [\ref=ngcm] for augmentations.

Let [formula], [formula] be the inclusion and ĝ given by ([\ref=ghat]). Assume that q(γ)  ≥  2. If [formula] is a free [formula]-module for a 1-parameter deformation G of g then there exists a 1-parameter deformation Ĝ of ĝ for which [formula] is also a free [formula]-module.

Without loss of generality we may assume that G is given by

[formula]

for [formula], [formula] and [formula], [formula]. Define so that Ĝ is also a deformation of G. Since

[formula]

[formula] has dimension less than or equal to 1. Now, [formula] for all [formula] and [formula]. So,

[formula]

whence [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and v is [formula]-regular by [\cite=matsumura]. Hence, [formula] is a Cohen-Macaulay module of dimension 1. Since

[formula]

ρ is a finite map on [formula]. Thus, [formula] is a finite [formula]-module; moreover it is Cohen-Macaulay since the Cohen-Macaulay property is conserved under finite pushforwards. Now the result easily follows from the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula

[formula]

(cf. [\cite=matsumura]).

Examples of augmentations in dimensions

The map-germs listed in Table [\ref=tablea] are also augmentations of finitely A-determined map-germs. Notice that Âk given by ([\ref=AAk]) is A-equivalent to the map-germ

[formula]

The initial map-germ of ([\ref=AAk2]) is

[formula]

One can see that the double point scheme of hk is an isolated singularity for k = 2,3,4. Hence hk is finitely A-determined (see [\cite=mond87] for the criteria). On the other hand, the initial map-germ of [formula], given by ([\ref=BBk]), is

[formula]

Finite A-determinacy of 1 was stated in [\cite=bruce-marar]. For [formula], it follows from a calculation on SINGULAR.

The map-germ

[formula]

is finitely A-determined and satisfies Conjecture [\ref=conjmond] for all [formula].

Notice that [formula] is an augmentation of by

[formula]

and [formula]. Let G be the identity on [formula]. The image of γ cuts DV(G) only at {0}. Therefore, finite A-determinacy follows from Theorem [\ref=newex]. One can check that f1 satisfies Conjecture [\ref=ngcm]. The statement for [formula] (or q(γ)  ≥  2) follows from Proposition [\ref=propng] for h satisfies the conjecture for n = 2 by the theorem of Mond and others.

Examples of augmentations in dimensions

Each map-germ in the series

[formula]

is A-finite with A-codimension [formula] and satisfies Conjecture [\ref=conjmond] for all [formula].

Notice that [formula] is an augmentation of Â2, given in Table [\ref=tablea], by

[formula]

and [formula].

Let G be the identity on [formula]. Any curve γ:w  ↦  (0,γ2(w),0), where γ2(w) is not constant, intersects DV(G) only at the origin. Hence, [formula] is also finitely A-determined by Theorem [\ref=newex]. Now we will show that [formula] has dimension [formula] over [formula] where [formula] for all [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let [formula] denote the standard basis for Θ(F)π. A calculation on SINGULAR shows that a Groebner basis for [formula] with respect to the reverse lexicographic order with priority given to the coefficients is given by the following vector fields.

[formula]

Let [formula] so that [formula]. By an application of Buchberger's Algorithm, we find that [formula], ι*m17, m18 together with the following elements form a Groebner basis for [formula].

[formula]

By a standard argument from commutative algebra,

[formula]

in which [formula] stands for the ideal of leading monomials with respect to the chosen ordering. So,

[formula]

We observe that [formula] is a 1-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay module for [formula] (here G is a 1-parameter unfolding of ĝ1 and H is the defining equation of V, as usual). Since Â2 satisfies the conjecture; so does [formula] for [formula] (Proposition [\ref=propng]).

By similar calculations, we can prove the following two propositions.

The map-germ [formula] defined by ([\ref=ex-bruce]) has Ae-codimension [formula].

The map-germs shown in Table [\ref=tableO] are finitely A-determined and satisfy the conjecture for all [formula].

See Table [\ref=tableunf] for the list of unfoldings from which the series in Table [\ref=tableO] are deduced.

The smallest codimension we have got so far is [formula] in the dimensions (4,5) and [formula] in (5,6).

The map-germs [formula] and [formula] are actually parts of the series

[formula]

which are finitely A-determined with [formula].

The formula for Ae-codimension for each germ in Table [\ref=tableO] is a linear form in one variable and the constant term is equal to the codimension of the initial map-germ. It would be interesting to see if this holds in general.

All map-germs from Houston and Kirk's list of simple singularities of corank 1 ([\cite=houston-kirk]) can be constructed from finitely A-determined map-germs in E02,3 by our method. We list them in Table [\ref=tableHK] together with their initial map-germs. The labels for the initial map-germs are from Mond's list in [\cite=mondclass].
