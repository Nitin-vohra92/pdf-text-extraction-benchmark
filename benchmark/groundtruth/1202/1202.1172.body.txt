Nonlocal Gravitational Models and Exact Solutions

Nonlocal gravitational models

In this paper we consider nonlocal gravity models, which are describing by the action

[formula]

where [formula], the Planck mass being [formula] GeV. We use the signature ( - , + , + , + ), g is the determinant of the metric tensor gμν, Λ is the cosmological constant, f is a differentiable function, and [formula] is the matter Lagrangian. Note that the modified gravity action ([\ref=nl1]) does not include a new dimensional parameter. This nonlocal model has a local scalar-tensor formulation. Introducing two scalar fields, η and ξ, we can rewrite action ([\ref=nl1]) in the following local form:

[formula]

By varying the action ([\ref=anl2]) over ξ, we get [formula]. Substituting [formula] into action ([\ref=anl2]), one reobtains action ([\ref=nl1]). Varying action ([\ref=anl2]) with respect to the metric tensor gμν, one gets

[formula]

where [formula] is the covariant derivative and [formula] the energy-momentum tensor of matter.

Variation of action ([\ref=anl2]) with respect to η yields [formula], where the prime denotes derivative with respect to η. If the scalar fields η and ξ depend on time only, then in the spatially flat Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker metric with the interval

[formula]

equations ([\ref=nl4]) are equivalent to the following ones:

[formula]

[formula]

where Ψ(t) = f(η(t)) - ξ(t), [formula] is the Hubble parameter, differentiation with respect to time t is denoted by a dot. For a perfect matter fluid, we have [formula] and [formula]. The equation of state (EoS) is

[formula]

The equations of motion for the scalar fields η and ξ are as follows

[formula]

[formula]

Note that the considered system of equations does not include the function η, but only f(η), f'(η) and time derivatives of η. Also, one can add a constant to f(η) and the same constant to ξ, without changing of equations. So, f(η) can be determined up to a constant.

For the model with action ([\ref=anl2]), contained a perfect fluid with a constant state parameter [formula], a reconstruction procedure has been made [\cite=Koivisto] in terms of functions of the scale factor a. For the model, describing by the initial nonlocal action ([\ref=nl1]), a technique for choosing the distortion function so as to fit an arbitrary expansion history has been derived in [\cite=Woodard].

Our goal is to demonstrate how one can reconstruct f(η) and get a model with exact solutions for the given Hubble parameter H(t) and the state parameter [formula]. We show that to do this it is enough to solve only linear differential equations.

The algorithm is as follows:

Assume the explicit form of the functions H(t) and [formula].

Solve ([\ref=equ_rho]) and get [formula].

Solve ([\ref=equ3]) and get η(t).

Subtracting equation ([\ref=equ1]) from equation ([\ref=equ2]), get a linear differential equation

[formula]

Using the known H(t), [formula], and [formula], solve ([\ref=equPsi]) and get Ψ(t).

Substituting ξ(t) = f(η(t)) - Ψ(t) into equation ([\ref=equ4]), we get a linear differential equation for f(η)

[formula]

To get ([\ref=equaf]) we also use the inverse function t(η). Note that equation ([\ref=equaf]) is a necessary condition that the model has solutions in the given form.

Solve ([\ref=equaf]) and get the sought-for function f(η).

Substitute the obtained function f(η) to equation ([\ref=equ1]) and equation ([\ref=equ2]) to check the existence of the solutions in the given form.

Nonlocal models with de Sitter solutions

To demonstrate how the algorithm work we seek a such f(η) that the model has a de Sitter solution, in other words, the Hubble parameter is a nonzero constant: H  =  H0. In this case, equation ([\ref=equ3]) has the following general solution:

[formula]

with integration constants t0 and η0. All equations are homogeneous. If a solution exists at t0 = 0, then it exists at an arbitrary t0. So, without loss of generality we can set t0 = 0.

Note that equation ([\ref=equaf]) has been obtained without any restrictions on solutions and the perfect matter fluid. To demonstrate how one can get f(η), which admits the existence of de Sitter solutions, in the explicit form, we restrict ourself to the case η0 = 0. In this case, equation ([\ref=equaf]) has the following form:

[formula]

where [formula]. We get the following solution

[formula]

where C3 and C4 are arbitrary constants. We can fix C4 without loss of generality.

Following [\cite=1104.2692], we consider the matter with the state parameter [formula] to be a constant, not equal to - 1. Thus, equation ([\ref=equ_rho]) has the following general solution

[formula]

where ρ0 is an arbitrary constant. Equation ([\ref=equPsi]) has the following general solution:

At [formula] and [formula], where C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants.

Substituting the explicit form of Ψ(t), we get

[formula]

[formula]

where C3 and C4 are arbitrary constants. Note that C2 is an arbitrary constant as well.

One can see that the key ingredient of all functions fi(η) is an exponent function. For the models with f(η) equal to an exponential function or a sum of exponential functions, particular de Sitter solutions have been found in [\cite=1104.2692] [\cite=Odintsov0708]. De Sitter solutions in the case of the exponential function f have been generalized and those stability have been analysed in [\cite=EPV2011].

Conclusion

Exact solutions play an important role in modern cosmological models, in particular, in nonlocal cosmological models [\cite=1104.2692] [\cite=Odintsov0708] [\cite=EPV2011] [\cite=Biswas] [\cite=AJV0711] [\cite=ZS] [\cite=BCK]. The main result of this paper is the algorithm, using which one can reconstruct [formula], corresponding to the given Hubble parameter and the state parameter of the matter. We have found that the function f corresponding to de Sitter solutions is an exponential function or a sum of exponential functions. In the case of the exponential function f, expanding universe solutions a  ~  tn have been found in [\cite=Odintsov0708] [\cite=ZS]. We plan to analyse possible forms of the corresponding function f in future investigations.
