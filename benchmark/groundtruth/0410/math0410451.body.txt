A singular perturbation problem

Introduction

Let

[formula]

ε = const > 0, f is a nonlinear smooth function, [formula] is a real-valued function

[formula]

We are interested in the following questions:

1)Under what assumptions does problem [\eqref=e1.1] have a solution?

2)When does [formula] converge to u as ε  →  0?

Here u is a solution to

[formula]

The following is an answer to the first question.

Assume [formula], (1.2) holds, [formula], and a is sufficiently large (see [\eqref=e2.7] and [\eqref=e2.9] below). Then equation [\eqref=e1.1] has a solution [formula], [formula] for any ε > 0.

In Section 4 the potential q is allowed to grow at infinity.

An answer to the second question is:

If [formula] is a monotone, growing function, such that [formula] and [formula], where u0 > 0 is a fixed number, then there is a solution [formula] to [\eqref=e1.1] such that

[formula]

where u(x) solves [\eqref=e1.3].

Singular perturbation problems have been discussed in the literature [\cite=B], [\cite=L], [\cite=VL].

In Section [\ref=S:2] proofs are given.

In Section [\ref=S:3] an alternative approach is proposed.

In Section [\ref=S:4] an extension of the results to a larger class of potentials is given.

Proofs

The existence of a solution to (1.1) is proved by means of the contraction mapping principle.

Let g be the Green's function

[formula]

Let p: = q - a2  ≥  0. Then [\eqref=e1.1] can be written as:

[formula]

Let [formula] be the Banach space of continuous and globally bounded functions, [formula], and [formula].

We choose R such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

If [\eqref=e2.3] and [\eqref=e2.4] hold, then the contraction mapping principle yields a solution [formula] to [\eqref=e2.2], and, therefore, to problem (1.1).

The assumption [formula] guarantees that [formula].

Let us check [\eqref=e2.3]. If [formula], then

[formula]

where M(R): =  max |u|  ≤  R|f(u)|. Here we have used the following estimate:

[formula]

If [formula] and a is such that

[formula]

then [\eqref=e2.3] holds.

Let us check [\eqref=e2.4]. Assume that v,w∈BR, v - w: = z. Then

[formula]

where [formula]. If

[formula]

then [\eqref=e2.4] holds. By the contraction mapping principle, [\eqref=e2.7] and [\eqref=e2.9] imply the existence and uniqueness of the solution [formula] to [\eqref=e1.1] in BR for any ε > 0.

Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] is proved.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] one can choose R and γ independent of ε > 0. Let us denote by Tε the operator defined in (2.2). Then (see Remark 2.2 ) one has

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is known [\cite=KA] and easy to prove (see Remark [\ref=R:2.3]) that if [\eqref=e2.10] holds for every v∈X, and γ in [\eqref=e2.4] does not depend on ε, then [\eqref=e1.4] holds, where u solves the limiting equation [\eqref=e2.2]:

[formula]

Equation [\eqref=e2.12] is equivalent to [\eqref=e1.3]. Theorem 1.2 is proved.

Conditions of Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] and Theorem [\ref=T:1.2] are satisfied if, for example, q(x) = a2 + 1 +  sin (ωx),where ω = const > 0, f(u) = (u + 1)m, m > 1, or f(u) = eu.

Note that in the distribution sense

[formula]

Let [formula], v = Tε0(v): = T0(v), and [formula] for all w∈X, [formula], 0 < γ < 1, γ does not depend on ε, [formula], u0 = v. Then [formula], and [formula]. Taking n  →    ∞  , one gets [formula] as ε  →  ε0.

A different approach

Let us outline a different approach to problem [\eqref=e1.1]. Set x = ξ  +  εy. Then

[formula]

[formula], p: = q(εy + ξ) - a2  ≥  0. Thus

[formula]

where

[formula]

One has

[formula]

Using an argument similar to the one in the proofs of Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] and Theorem [\ref=T:1.2], one concludes that for any ε > 0 and any sufficiently large a, problem [\eqref=e3.1] has a unique solution, which tends to a limit w = w(y,ξ) as [formula], where w solves the problem

[formula]

Problem [\eqref=e3.5] has an obvious solution w = w(ξ), which is indepent of y and solves the equation

[formula]

The solution to [\eqref=e3.5] is unique if a is sufficiently large. This is proved similarly to the proof of (2.9). Namely, let b2: = q(ξ). Note that b  ≥  a. If there are two solutions to (3.5), say w and v, and if z: = w - v, then ||z||  ≤  b- 2M1(R)||z|| < ||z||, provided that b- 2M1(R) < 1. Thus z = 0, and the uniqueness of the solution to [\eqref=e3.5] is proved.

Replacing ξ by x in [\eqref=e3.6], we obtain the solution found in Theorem [\ref=T:1.2].

Extension of the results to a larger class of potentials

Here a method for a study of problem [\eqref=e1.1] for a larger class of potentials q(x) is given. We assume that q(x)  ≥  a2 and can grow to infinity as |x|  →    ∞  . Note that in Sections 1 and 2 the potential was assumed to be a bounded function. Let [formula] be the Green's function

[formula]

As in Section [\ref=S:2], problem [\eqref=e1.1] is equivalent to

[formula]

and this equation has a unique solution in BR if a2 is sufficiently large. The proof, similar to the one given in Section [\ref=S:2], requires the estimate

[formula]

Let us prove the above inequality. Let Gj be the Green's function satisfying equation (4.1) with q = qj, j = 1,2. Estimate (4.3) follows from the inequality

[formula]

This inequality can be derived from the maximum principle.

If q2 = a2, then [formula], and the inequality [formula] implies (4.3).

We prove below the following relation:

[formula]

where [formula] is the set of [formula] functions vanishing at infinity together with their derivatives. This formula is an analog to [\eqref=e2.13].

To prove [\eqref=e4.5], multiply [\eqref=e4.1] by h(y), integrate over [formula] with respect to y, then integrate the first term by parts, and then let ε  →  0. The result is [\eqref=e4.5].

Thus, Theorem [\ref=T:1.1] and Theorem [\ref=T:1.2] remain valid for q(x)  ≥  a2, a > 0 sufficiently large, [formula] monotonically growing to infinity, and the solution u(x) to the limiting equation [\eqref=e1.3] is the limit of the solution to [\eqref=e4.2] as ε  →  0.
