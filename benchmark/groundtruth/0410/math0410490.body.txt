Let V be a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space, with positive dimension, and let [formula] be a norm on V. Thus [formula] is a nonnegative real number for all v∈V, [formula] if and only if v  =  0, [formula] for all real or complex numbers α, as appropriate, and all v∈V, and [formula] for all v,w∈V.

Associated to this norm we get a metric [formula] on V. Since V has finite dimension, it is linearly isomorphic to [formula] or [formula], where n is the dimension of V, according to whether V is a real or complex vector space. The topology on V determined by the metric [formula] corresponds exactly to the usual topology on [formula] or [formula] with respect to this isomorphism, by standard arguments.

Let λ be a linear functional on V, which is to say a linear mapping from V into the real or complex numbers, as appropriate. Using the identification with a Euclidean space, one can see that there is a nonnegative real number k such that

[formula]

for all v∈V.

Put

[formula]

The supremum is finite by the remarks in the preceding paragraph, and [formula] can also be described as the smallest nonnegative real number k such that |λ(v)| is less than or equal to k times [formula] for all v∈V. The space of all linear functionals on V is denoted V* and is a vector space with the same dimension as V, and [formula] defines a norm on V* called the dual norm associated to [formula].

If v is any vector in V, then a famous theorem implies that there is a linear functional λ on V such that [formula] and

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

for all v∈V.

Let Σ denote the unit sphere in V* with respect to the dual norm [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

This is a compact subset of V* with respect to the topology induced by the dual norm, which is the same as a topology induced from the standard Euclidean topology using an isomorphism with Euclidean space. Let us write C(Σ) for the vector space of continuous real or complex-valued functions on Σ, using the same scalars as for V.

For φ∈C(Σ) put

[formula]

where in fact the maximum is attained by standard results in analysis. One can check that this defines a norm on C(Σ), called the supremum norm.

For each v∈V we get a function φv∈C(Σ) given by

[formula]

The correspondence v  ↦  φv defines a linear mapping from V into C(V) such that

[formula]

for all v∈V.

Let E be a finite nonempty set, and let F(E,V) denote the vector space of V-valued functions on E. If f is a real or complex-valued function on E, put

[formula]

which defines a norm on the vector space of real or complex-valued functions on E. Similarly, if f is a V-valued function on E, then put

[formula]

which defines a norm on F(E,V).

Suppose that t(x,y) is a real or complex-valued function on the Cartesian product E  ×  E. Thus we get a linear mapping T from the vector space of real or complex-valued functions on E to itself, as appropriate, given by

[formula]

Let a be a nonnegative real number such that

[formula]

for all real or complex-valued functions f on E. This is equivalent to the condition that

[formula]

for all x∈E2.

Let us write TV for the version of T acting on V-valued functions on E, assuming that V is real or complex according to whether t(x,y) is real or complex-valued. Namely, for a V-valued function f on E, TV(f)(x) is defined by the same formula as in the scalar case. One can check that

[formula]

for all V-valued functions f on E, using the condition on |t(x,y)| mentioned in the previous paragraph. Alternatively, one can consider the linear operator TC(Σ) which is the version of T on C(Σ)-valued functions on E, which basically acts pointwise on Σ, and derive the analogous inequality using the supremum norm on C(Σ) from the inequality for scalar-valued functions. The inequality for V-valued functions then follows by employing the isometric embedding of V in C(Σ).

If f is a real or complex-valued function on E, then put

[formula]

and more generally if f is a V-valued function on E put

[formula]

These define norms on the vector spaces of scalar-valued and V-valued functions on E.

Suppose that t(x,y), T are as before, and that b is a nonnegative real number such that

[formula]

for all scalar-valued functions f on E. This is equivalent to the condition that

[formula]

for all x∈E. In this event we have that

[formula]

for all V-valued functions f on E too.

Fix a real number p, 1  <  p  <    ∞  , and put

[formula]

for scalar-valued functions on E and

[formula]

for V-valued functions on E. Again these define norms on the vector spaces of scalar and V-valued functions on E.

Let us take for V the vector space of real or complex-valued functions on E, as appropriate. A V-valued function on E is then basically the same as a real or complex-valued function f(x,z) on E  ×  E. The linear transformation TV on V-valued functions on E can be described explicitly by saying that if f(w,z) is a real or complex-valued function on E  ×  E, as appropriate, then TV(f) is the function on E  ×  E given by

[formula]

Let us use the norm [formula] on functions on E as our norm on V. If 1  ≤  p  <    ∞   and f(x,z) is a function on E  ×  E, which is equivalently a V-valued function on E, then

[formula]

Suppose that h(x) is a real or complex-valued function on E, as appropriate. Consider the function H(x,z) on E  ×  E given by H(x,z)  =  h(x) when x  =  z, H(x,z)  =  0 when x  ≠  z. Thus we have that [formula] for all p, 1  ≤  p  <    ∞  .

Fix p, 1  <  p  <    ∞  , and suppose that Bp is a nonnegative real number such that

[formula]

for all V-valued functions on E. If h is a scalar-valued function on E and H is the associated function on E  ×  E described in the previous paragraph, then TV(H) is the function on E  ×  E given by t(x,z)  h(z). Hence

[formula]

for all real or complex-valued functions h on E.
