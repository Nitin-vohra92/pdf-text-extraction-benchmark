On the homotopy types of Kähler manifolds and the birational Kodaira problem

Introduction

In small dimensions, it is known that Kähler compact manifolds are deformation equivalent to smooth projective complex varieties. In dimension 2, this follows from the following theorem: The so-called Kodaira problem left open by this result asked whether more generally any compact Kähker manifold can be deformed to a projective complex manifold.

Recently, we solved negatively this question by constructing, in any dimension [formula], examples of compact Kähler manifolds, which do not deform to projective complex manifolds, as a consequence of the following stronger statement concerning the topology of Kähler compact manifolds:

However, these examples were obtained starting either from certain complex tori or from self-products of certain generalized Kummer varieties, and then blowing-up them along adequate subsets.

Hence, all these examples are bimeromorphically equivalent to other complex manifolds which satisfy the property of deforming to projective complex manifolds, namely complex tori, or self-products of generalized Kummer varieties.

The following question, which was asked to me by N. Buchdahl, F. Campana, S.-T. Yau, and can be considered as a birational version of the Kodaira problem, is thus quite natural:

Question. Let X be a compact Kähler manifold. Does there exist a bimeromorphic model X' of X which deforms to a projective complex manifold?

In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is again no, which follows from the following stronger statement: In this statement, we can in fact replace "homotopy type" with "rational homotopy type", that is "rational cohomology ring" (see Theorem [\ref=maincoh]). Indeed, the whole discussion deals with the Hodge structure on rational cohomology and the (non)-existence of polarizations on them.

Construction of examples

We start as in [\cite=voisin], namely, we consider n-dimensional complex tori T admitting an endomorphism

[formula]

satisfying the following property (*). We can write T as [formula], where Γ is a rank 2n lattice, [formula] and Γ' is a complex subspace of [formula] of rank n such that

[formula]

Let φ be the endomorphism φT * of [formula]. Clearly Γ' has to be an eigenspace of [formula], so no eigenvalue of φ can be real. The condition (*) is the following:

(*) The characteristic polynomial of φ (which has integer coefficients), has 2n distinct roots (the eigenvalues of φ) and its Galois group over [formula] acts as the symmetric group of 2n letters on them.

In the sequel, we will need to assume that the dimension n of T is at least 4. We make now the following construction. Let T̂ be the dual torus of T, namely

[formula]

Geometrically, T̂ is the torus

[formula]

which is the group of topologically trivial holomorphic line bundles on T up to isomorphism.

There exists on T  ×  T̂ the so-called Poincaré line bundle P which is uniquely characterized by the following properties :

- For any t∈T̂ parameterizing a line bundle Lt on T, we have

[formula]

- The restriction P|0  ×  T̂ is trivial.

In fact P is constructed as follows : first of all, its first Chern class

[formula]

is the identity

[formula]

which is easily seen to be of Hodge type (1,1). Next the uniqueness of P is forced by the conditions

[formula]

Next, because T admits the endomorphism φT, we also have the line bundle

[formula]

We now make the following construction:Over T  ×  T̂, consider the rank 2 vector bundles

[formula]

and the corresponding associated projective bundles [formula]. The two commuting involutions ( - Id,Id) and (Id, - Id) of T  ×  T̂ lift to commuting involutions i,  î, resp. iφ,  îφ acting on E resp. Eφ, since we have isomorphisms

[formula]

[formula]

which can be made canonical by a choice of trivialization

[formula]

(0,0) being a fixed point of both (Id, - Id) and ( - Id,Id).

The compact Kähler manifold we shall consider is the following:We start with the fibered product

[formula]

It admits the commuting involutions

[formula]

over ( - Id,Id), (Id, - Id) respectively. The quotient Q of [formula] by the group [formula] generated by these involutions is singular along the non free locus of this action, but the quotient admits a Kähler compact desingularization. For example, one can start by desingularizing the quotient [formula] by blowing-up the fixed locus of (i,iφ) and then taking the quotient of the blown-up variety by the natural involution which lifts (i,iφ). The result is smooth Kähler and by naturality (î,îφ) acts on it as an involution. Then one can desingularize in the same way the quotient of this new variety by (î,îφ).

Our compact Kähler manifold X will be any Kähler desingularization of this quotient.

Note that, if K is the Kummer variety of T, namely the desingularization of the quotient of T by the - Id involution, obtained by blowing-up the images of the 2-torsion points of T, and similarly [formula] is the Kummer variety of T̂, then over K0  ×  0, X is a [formula]-bundle, where K0 is the open set T0  /    ±  Id of K, with

[formula]

and similarly for 0.

The next sections will be devoted to the proof of the following Theorem:

Some results on the cohomology ring of X'

We plan to show in fact the following slightly stronger result: In other words, Theorem [\ref=property] is true for rational homotopy type rather than homotopy type, since it is known that the rational homotopy type of a compact Kähler manifold is determined by its rational cohomology algebra (see [\cite=DGM]).

This section will be devoted to the study of the cohomology ring of any compact complex manifold X' given as in Theorem [\ref=maincoh]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=maincoh] will be given in the next section, following the same line as [\cite=voisin], section 3.

Recall that X admits a holomorphic map

[formula]

obtained by composing the desingularization map

[formula]

with the natural map

[formula]

For simplicity of notations, we shall assume in the sequel that our X in section [\ref=sec1] has been chosen so that q extends to a holomorphic map

[formula]

which can always be achieved by a bimeromorphic transformation.

Let [formula] be any bimeromorphic map. Then [formula] is holomorphic.

Proof. The complex manifold T  ×  T̂ does not contain any closed complex curve. Indeed, it suffices to prove this for T or T̂. Now, the cohomology class

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maincoh].

In this section, we assume the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=maincoh], namely, X' is bimeromorphically equivalent to X, and Y is a compact Kähler manifold such that there exists an isomorphism

[formula]

of graded algebras. We want to prove that Y cannot be projective.

Our argumentation will be based on the analysis of the algebra [formula] made in the previous section, and on the following Lemma [\ref=delignelemma] due to Deligne (see [\cite=deligne], [\cite=voisin], section 3) which was already heavily used in the last section of [\cite=voisin].

Let B* be a finite dimensional graded algebra over [formula] and assume that each Bk carries a rational Hodge structure, compatible with the product, i.e. the product map

[formula]

is a morphism of Hodge structures. Let [formula] be an algebraic subset defined by homogeneous equations which can be formulated using only the product structure on B*. We have in mind, eg

[formula]

or, which will be also used in the sequel, Z' = Sing  Z, for Z as above.

(Deligne) For Z as above, let Z1  ⊂  Z be an union of irreducible reduced components of Z. Assume that the [formula]-vector space < Z1  >   generated by Z1 is defined over [formula], that is [formula], for some [formula]-vector space [formula]. Then [formula] is a rational sub-Hodge structure of [formula].

Our first step is the following (notations are as in the previous section):

Let X', Y, γ be as above. Then [formula] and [formula] are rational sub-Hodge structures of [formula].

Proof. We give the proof for [formula], the proof for [formula] is identical.

We have only to explain how to recover the space [formula] as generated by a certain algebraic subset of [formula] defined using only the algebra structure on [formula], since then, via γ, we will then recover similarly [formula] and then by Deligne's Lemma [\ref=delignelemma], we will know that [formula] is a sub-Hodge structure of [formula].

We first use Proposition [\ref=propcruciale]. It says that the irreducible components of the algebraic subset

[formula]

containing the algebraic subset

[formula]

are irreducible components of

[formula]

Next Lemma [\ref=produitdiv] says us that if we denote by D1 the [formula]-vector subspace of [formula] defined as

[formula]

the condition

[formula]

for some

[formula]

implies that [formula].

Using this Lemma, we conclude that the following algebraic subset of [formula],

[formula]

also satisfies the property that its irreducible components containing ZA1 are irreducible components of Z. Note now that the vector space [formula] is defined over [formula] and generated by its algebraic subset ZA1, because A*1 is the exterior algebra [formula].

Thus, it remains only to show how to recover ZA1 from Z'1. This is done as follows. Let

[formula]

be the complex vector space generated by the algebraic subset

[formula]

[formula] is defined over [formula], that is

[formula]

for some rational subspace [formula], because [formula] is, and ZD1 is defined over [formula].

If D'1 = 0, there is nothing to say because then Z'1 = ZA1. In general, the formula defining Z'1 shows that it is the "join" of ZD1 and ZA1 in [formula].

Assume first that [formula]. In this case we recover ZA1 as a component of the singular locus of Z'1 because the join of two algebraic sets admits one of these algebraic sets as an union of component of its singular locus unless the other one is linear. So in this case, we recover ZA1 from the algebra structure of [formula] and this is finished.

It remains only to exclude the possibility that

[formula]

This is done by the following argument : assume ([\ref=mauvais]) holds. As D'1 is a [formula]-vector space, there would be in particular a non zero real element [formula] such that

[formula]

But there exists also a non-zero

[formula]

such that α2 = 0. It follows that the rank 2 real vector space

[formula]

satisfies the property:

[formula]

But this contradicts the Hodge index theorem (cf [\cite=voisinbook] I, 6.3.2) because X' is dominated by a Kähler compact manifold, and it follows that for some element [formula], the intersection form

[formula]

has only one positive sign on [formula], hence cannot admit a rank 2 real isotropic subspace. Thus ([\ref=mauvais]) leads to a contradiction, and the proposition is proved.

Proof. We use Lemma [\ref=dercoh], b), which says that [formula] is an irreducible component of the set

[formula]

It follows that [formula] is an irreducible component of the set

[formula]

But we know as a consequence of Proposition [\ref=subHodge1] that γ- 1(A4n - 2) is a rational sub-Hodge structure of [formula]. Indeed, it is equal to the degree 4n - 2 piece of the subalgebra generated by γ- 1(A2) and γ- 1(A2) is a rational sub-Hodge structure of [formula].

It follows that its annihilator

[formula]

is also a rational sub-Hodge structure of [formula].

Hence there is an induced rational Hodge structure on the quotient

[formula]

and we can apply Deligne's Lemma [\ref=delignelemma] to the product

[formula]

which is compatible with the induced Hodge structure: Indeed, for this product, we have that [formula] is an irreducible component of the set

[formula]

As γ- 1(D) is a rational subspace of [formula], Lemma [\ref=delignelemma] says that it is a rational sub-Hodge structure of [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maincoh]. The isomorphism of graded algebras

[formula]

must be compatible up to a coefficient with Poincaré duality, which is given by the cup-product and isomorphisms

[formula]

As γ- 1(A2) is a rational sub-Hodge structure of [formula], so is

[formula]

because it is equal to the degree 4n - 4 piece of the subalgebra of [formula] generated by γ- 1(A2).

Now, the map which is Poincaré dual to the inclusion

[formula]

is the map

[formula]

[formula]

where the last isomorphism is given by the Künneth decomposition. We shall denote by

[formula]

the Künneth projector given by the decomposition above.

Applying γ- 1, we thus get a projection

[formula]

which must be a morphism of Hodge structures as its transpose ([\ref=sansnom]) is. Composing further with the projection (conjugate via γ to κ)

[formula]

which is also a morphism of Hodge structures because [formula] and [formula] are sub-Hodge structures of [formula], we get finally a morphism of Hodge structures

[formula]

Restricting it to the sub-Hodge structure [formula] generated by γ- 1(D), we finally get a morphism of rational Hodge structures

[formula]

which is conjugate via γ to the restriction of [formula] to D4.

We have now the following two Lemmas :

The image of

[formula]

contains

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let now

[formula]

be the image of πγ.

a) The generic element of Πγ is non-degenerate.

(Here we see [formula] as an element of

[formula]

and non-degenerate means invertible.)

b) The [formula] vector subspace Πγ' of [formula] generated by the [formula] non-degenerate in Πγ, consists of Hodge classes in [formula], (relative to the Hodge structures on [formula] induced by the Hodge structure on [formula]).

Assuming these Lemmas, the proof is now concluded as follows.

The two Lemmas together imply that the Hodge structure on [formula] admits an endomorphism conjugate to [formula]. Hence dually the Hodge structure on [formula] admits a morphism conjugate to [formula].

The proof concludes then exactly as in [\cite=voisin], 3.2: The above implies that either the Hodge structure on [formula] is trivial or it does not contain any Hodge class. The first case is excluded by a Hodge index argument.

Next, working symmetrically with [formula], we conclude similarly that the Hodge structure on [formula] does not contain any Hodge class.

Thus it follows from Corollary [\ref=coroD] that the only degree 2 Hodge classes on Y are contained in γ- 1(D).

But we look now at the intersection form

[formula]

for d∈γ- 1(D), and we conclude that it is zero on [formula], because the same is true for D and [formula] on X'. Thus for no degree 2 Hodge class d on Y, the sub-Hodge structure [formula] can be polarized by qd. Thus by [\cite=voisinbook], I, 6.3.2, Y cannot be projective.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=avantder]. We first reduce to the case where X' = X:First of all, using Lemma [\ref=sub1], we conclude that for any non-empty Zariski open set U of K0  ×  0, the restriction map

[formula]

is an isomorphism. Now we have the commutative diagram:

[formula]

We use now Proposition [\ref=propess] which says that the meromorphic map ψ is well defined on a Zariski open set X'U as above. We thus have a commutative diagram:

[formula]

where [formula] denote the restrictions of [formula] to XU,  X'U respectively. We used here the fact that degree 2 Hodge classes on X, restricted to XU, pull-back via ψU to degree 2 Hodge classes on X', restricted to X'U, which follows from the fact that ψ is meromorphic.

Writing for X the same diagram as ([\ref=restUmatrix]), we conclude that it suffices to prove the result for X.

Next, we look at the following Cartesian diagram:

[formula]

where the lower indices 0 denote the restrictions of the projective bundles to T0  ×  , the vertical maps denoted by e are the quotient maps, and the induced map

[formula]

are injective. Here X0 is the Zariski open set of X which is the smooth part of the quotient Q. Arguing as before, we see that we can replace X by X0, and then X0 by its étale cover [formula]. Thus the result for X follows from the following formulas ([\ref=formule]):

Let Σ,  Σφ be the two divisors of ([\ref=Sigma]), and let [formula] be their cohomology classes. Then we have

[formula]

This is computed as follows: let s1,  s2 be the classes of the divisors Σ1,  Σ2 of [formula] given by the decomposition [formula] and similarly let sφ1,  sφ2 be the classes of the divisors Σφ1,  Σφ2 of [formula] given by the decomposition [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

Let h, hφ be respectively [formula], [formula], or rather their pull-backs to the fibered product [formula]. Let p,  pφ be the classes c1(P),  c1(Pφ). Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

Applying * we conclude that

[formula]

As [formula], and [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Finally, since p identifies to

[formula]

we get that p2 identifies to

[formula]

and similarly p2φ identifies to

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=formule]) is proved, which concludes the proof of the Lemma.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=derlemma]. The first statement is obvious by Lemma [\ref=avantder].

Next, because we proved that Πγ is a sub-Hodge structure of

[formula]

it follows that the space Π'γ is a sub-Hodge structure of [formula], and thus, so is the sub-algebra of [formula] generated by Π'γ. On the other hand, Π'γ is conjugate via tγ to the corresponding subspace of [formula], defined similarly starting from [formula]. This last subspace is contained in the space of endomorphisms of Hodge structures of [formula], which has been computed to be equal to the algebra generated by [formula] (see proof of Lemma [\ref=plustard2]).

The key point is that because [formula] is diagonalizable, this algebra tensored with [formula] has no nilpotent element. It follows that [formula] has no nilpotent element. But as Π'γ is a sub-Hodge structure of [formula], it follows that it is pure of type (0,0), that is made of Hodge classes, because elements of type ( - k,k),  k > 0 are nilpotent.
