Recovering modular forms and representations from tensor and symmetric powers

Introduction

Let N  ≥  1, ~ k  ≥  2 be positive integers, and [formula], be a character mod N, satisfying ω( - 1) = ( - 1)k. Denote by S(N,k,ω)0 the space of new forms on Γ1(N) of weight k, and Nebentypus character ω. For f∈Sk(N,ω)0 and p coprime to N, let ap(f) denote the corresponding Hecke eigenvalue of the Hecke operator at p. As an arithmetical application of the results contained in this paper, we establish the following theorem:

Let f∈Snk(N,ω) and f'∈Snk'(N',ω') with k,k'  ≥  2. Let m  ≥  1 be a positive integer, and let

[formula]

Then the following hold:

a) If f is not a CM-form and ud(T) is positive, then there exists a Dirichlet character χ of order m such that for all p coprime to NN', we have

[formula]

In particular k = k' and ω  =  ω'χ2.

b) Suppose upper density of T is strictly greater than 1 - 2- (2m + 1). Then there exists a Dirichlet character χ such that for all p coprime to NN', we have

[formula]

If we further assume that the conductors N and N' are squarefree in a) (or in (b)), then f = f'.

When m = 1, the theorem can be considered as a refinement of strong multiplicity one and is proved in [\cite=rajan98]. The theorem was proved for the case m = 2 by D. Ramakrishnan [\cite=DR].

The starting point for the proof of the above theorem are the l-adic representations [formula] (for suitable rational primes l) of the absolute Galois group [formula] of [formula] to newforms f∈S(N,k,ω)0 of weight k  ≥  2 by the work of Shimura, Igusa, Ihara and Deligne. This has the property that for any rational prime p coprime to Nl the representation ρf is unramified at p and

[formula]

where for a prime p coprime to N σp denotes the Frobenius conjugacy class at p in the group [formula]. Further, if ρf≃ρf' then f = f'. Hence Theorem [\ref=thm:mf] follows provided the representation ρf can be recovered from knowing the mth tensor product representation [formula].

This leads us to consider the general problem of recovering l-adic representations from a knowledge of l-adic representations constructed algebraically out of the original representations. Let F be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. Suppose

[formula]

are continuous, semisimple representations of the Galois group GK into GLn(F), unramified outside a finite set S of places containing the archimedean places of K. Let M be an algebraic subgroup of GLn such that M(F) contains the image subgroups ρi(GK), ~ i = 1,2. Let

[formula]

be a rational representation of M into GLm defined over F.

Let T be a subset of the set of places ΣK of K satisfying,

[formula]

where ρi(σv) for [formula] denotes the Frobenius conjugacy classes lying in the image. Suppose that T is a 'sufficiently large' set of places of K. How are ρ1 and ρ2 related?

More specifically, under what conditions on T, R or the nature of the representations ρi, can we conclude that there exists a central abelian representation χ:GK  →  ZR(F), such that the representations ρ2 and [formula] are conjugate by an element of M(F)?

Further we would also like to know the answer when we take R to be a 'standard representation', for example if R is taken to be kth tensor, or symmetric or exterior powers of a linear representation of M. The representation [formula] can be thought of as an l-adic representation constructed algebraically from the original representation ρ.

When M is isomorphic to GLm, and R is taken to be the identity morphism, then the question is a refinement of strong multiplicity one and was considered in [\cite=rajan98]. In this paper we follow the algebraic methods and techniques of our earlier paper [\cite=rajan98].

We break the general problem outlined above into two steps. First we use the results of [\cite=rajan98], to conclude that [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic under suitable density hypothesis on T. We then consider the algebraic envelopes of the l-adic representations, and we try to answer the question of recovering rational representations of reductive group, where the role of the Galois group in the above problem is replaced by a reductive group.

The latter aspect can be done in a more abstract context. Indeed, let Γ be an abstract group, F be an arbitrary field of characteristic zero, and let ρ1,  ~  ρ2:Γ  →  GLn(F) be representations of Γ. Let

[formula]

be the product representation. Define G (resp. Gi, ~ i = 1,2) as the algebraic envelope (equivalently the Zariski closure) of the image group ρ(Γ) (resp. ρi(Γ)) in the algebraic group GLn  ×  GLn (resp. GLn). We continue to denote by ρi the two projection morphisms from G  →  Gi. The basic idea of our approach is to replace Γ by the algebraic envelope of ρ(Γ) and to recover the representations of the algebraic group G. This allows us to apply algebraic, in particular reductive group theoretic techniques towards a solution of the problem. For example, the algebraic methods allow us to work over complex numbers, and also to work with compact forms of the reductive group. The theorems are when G is connected; this has the effect of replacing Γ by a subgroup Γ' of finite index in Γ. To go from Γ' to Γ, we need some assumptions on the nature of the representation restricted to G01 (see Lemma [\ref=lem:extension].

For the arithmetical applications, typically further information on the nature of the l-adic representation will be required. For the application to modular forms, we require that the associated l-adic representation ρf is semisimple; the algebraic envelope of the image contains a maximal torus when the weight is at least two; when the form is non-CM, then the algebraic envelope is the full GL2.

The contents of the paper are as follows: we first consider the cases when R is either the symmetric, tensor power, adjoint and twisted tensor product (Asai) representations of the ambient group GLn. We also discuss the situation when the representation is absolutely irreducible and the algebraic envelope of the image is not connected, allowing us to treat CM forms.

Specialising to modular forms we generalise the results of Ramakrishnan [\cite=DR], where we consider arbitrary kth powers of the eigenvalues for a natural number k, and also kth symmetric powers in the eigenvalues of the modular forms, and the Asai representations.

Tensor and Symmetric powers, Adjoint and Asai representations

We recall the basic setup: Γ is an abstract group, F is a field of characteristic zero, ρ1,  ~  ρ2:Γ  →  GLn(F) are two representations of Γ, ρ: = ρ1  ×  ρ2:Γ  →  GLn(F)  ×  GLn(F) is the product representation, and R:GLn  →  GLm a rational representation with kernel contained in the centre of GLn. Define G (resp. Gi, ~ i = 1,2) as the algebraic envelope (equivalently the Zariski closure) of the image group ρ(Γ) (resp. ρi(Γ)) in the algebraic group GLn  ×  GLn (resp. GLn). For an algebraic group G, G0 will denote the connected component of the identity in G.

We now specialize R to some familiar representations. For a linear representation ρ of a group G into GLn, let Tk(ρ), ~ Sk(ρ), ~ Ek(ρ) ~ (k  ≤  n),  ~  Ad(ρ) be respectively the kth tensor, symmetric, exterior product and adjoint representations of G.

Tensor powers

Let G be a connected algebraic group over a characteristic zero base field F, and let ρ1,  ~  ρ2 be finite dimensional semisimple representations of G into GLn. Suppose that

[formula]

for some k  ≥  1. Then ρ1≃ρ2.

We can work over [formula]. Let χρ1 and χρ2 denote respectively the characters of ρ1 and ρ2. Since χkρ1  =  χkρ2, the characters χρ1 and χρ2 differ by a kth root of unity. Choose a connected neighbourhood U of the identity in [formula], where the characters are non-vanishing. Since χρ1(1) = χρ2(1), and the characters differ by a root of unity, we have χρ1  =  χρ2 on U. Since they are rational functions on [formula] and U is Zariski dense as G is connected, we see that χρ1  =  χρ2 on [formula]. Since the representations are semisimple, we obtain that ρ1 and ρ2 are equivalent.

The connectedness assumption cannot be dropped. Fong and Greiss [\cite=fong-griess95] (see also Example [\ref=blasius]), have constructed for infinitely many triples (n,q,m) homomorphisms of [formula] into [formula], which are elementwise conjugate but not conjugate as representations. Here [formula] is the finite field with q-elements. Lift two such homomorphisms to representations

[formula]

We obtain for each [formula], ρ1(g) is conjugate to λρ2(g), with λ a scalar. Let l be an exponent of the group [formula]. Then gl = 1 implies that λl = 1. Hence

[formula]

Thus the lth tensor powers of ρ1 and ρ2 are equivalent, but by construction there does not exist a character χ of [formula] such that [formula].

Symmetric powers

Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over a characteristic zero base field F. Let ρ1,ρ2 be finite dimensional representations of G into GLn. Suppose that

[formula]

for some k  ≥  1. Then ρ1≃ρ2.

We can work over [formula]. Let T be a maximal torus of G. Since two representations of a reductive group are equivalent if and only if their collection of weights with respect to a maximal torus T are the same, it is enough to show that the collection of weights of ρ1 and ρ2 with respect to T are the same. By Zariski density or Weyl's unitary trick, we can work with a compact form of [formula] with Lie algebra [formula]. Let [formula] be a maximal torus inside [formula]. The weights of the corresponding Lie algebra representations associated to ρ1 and ρ2 are real valued restricted to [formula]. Consequently we can order them with respect to a lexicographic ordering on the dual of [formula].

Let [formula] (resp. [formula]) be the weights of ρ1 (resp. ρ2) with [formula] (resp. [formula]). The weights of Sk(ρ1) are composed of elements of the form

[formula]

and similarly for Sk(ρ2).

By assumption the weights of Sk(ρ1) and Sk(ρ2) are same. Since kλ1 (resp. kμ1) is the highest weight of Sk(ρ1) (resp. Sk(ρ2)) with respect to the lexicographic ordering, we have kλ1 = kμ1. Hence λ1  =  μ1.

By induction, assume that for j < l,  ~  λj  =  μj. Then the set of weights [formula] and [formula] are same. Hence the complementary sets T1(l) (resp. T2(l)) composed of weights in Sk(ρ1) (resp. Sk(ρ2)), where at least one λj (resp. μj) occurs with positive coefficient for some j  ≥  l are the same.

The highest weight in T1(l) is (k - 1)λ1  +  λl, and in T2(i) is (k - 1)μ1  +  μl. Since λ1  =  μ1, we obtain λl  =  μl. Hence we have shown that the collection of weights of ρ1 and ρ2 are the same, and so the representations are equivalent.

Adjoint and Generalized Asai representations

For a G-module V, let Ad(V) denote the adjoint G-module given by the natural action of G on [formula], where V* is G-module dual to V.

Let G be a semisimple group, and let V,W be non self-dual irreducible representations of G. Let [formula], considered as G  ×  G-modules. Then as G  ×  G irreducible modules (or as reducible G modules), Ad(V1)≃Ad(V2), but V1 is neither isomorphic to V2 nor to the dual V*2.

However when G is simple, the following theorem establishing the unique factorisation of tensor products of irreducible representations of simple Lie algebras is proved in [\cite=Ra3]:

Let [formula] be a simple Lie algebra over [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] be non-trivial, irreducible, finite dimensional [formula]-modules. Assume that there is an isomorphism of the tensor products,

[formula]

as [formula]-modules. Then m = n, and there is a permutation τ of the set [formula], such that

[formula]

as [formula]-modules.

In particular, let V, ~ W be irreducible [formula]-modules and

[formula]

as [formula]-modules. Then V is either isomorphic to W or W*.

We define now a generalisation of (pre)-Asai representations. Let Γ be an abstract group, A be a finite set with a map

[formula]

Given a representation ρ:Γ  →  GLn, define the Asai representation,

[formula]

where ρa(γ) = ρ(θ(a)(γ)),  ~  γ∈Γ.

Let K / k be a Galois extension with Galois group G(K / k). Given ρ, we can associate the pre-Asai representation,

[formula]

where ρg(σ) = ρ(σ- 1), where σ∈GK and ∈Gk is a lift of g∈G(K / k). At an unramified place v of K, which is split completely over a place u of k, the Asai character is given by,

[formula]

where σv is the Frobenius conjugacy class at v. Hence we get that upto isomorphism, As(ρ) does not depend on the choice of the lifts [formula]. If further As(ρ) is irreducible, and K / k ic cyclic, then As(ρ) extends to a representation of Gk (called the Asai representation associated to ρ when n = 2 and K / k is quadratic).

Exterior powers

Let V and W be G-modules. It does not seem possible to conclude in general from an equivalence of the form Ek(V)≃Ek(W) as G-modules, that V≃W. Here Ek(V) denotes the exterior kth power of V. For example, let V be a non self-dual G-module of even dimension 2n. If G is semisimple, then En(V) is self-dual, and also that En(V) is dual to En(V*), where V* denotes the dual of V. Hence we have En(V)≃En(V*), but [formula].

Question: It would be interesting to know, for the possible applications in geometry, the relationship between two linear representations of a connected reductive group G over [formula] into GLn, given that their exterior kth power representations for some positive integer k < n are isomorphic.

Extending representations

The foregoing results allow us to conclude in some cases that the given representations coincide upon restricting to a subgroup of finite index in Γ. Assuming a suitable 'generic' hypothesis on the nature of the representations, it is possible to determine the representations on Γ itself, but upto twisting by characters:

Let ρ1,  ~  ρ2:Γ  →  GLn(F) be representations of Γ. Suppose there is a normal subgroup Γ' of Γ and a character χ':Γ'  →  F *  such that [formula]. Assume further that ρ1|Γ' is absolutely irreducible, and the character χ' is invariant with respect to the action of Γ on Γ' by conjugation. Then there is a character χ:Γ  →  F* such that,

[formula]

If further all the data are algebraic, then χ will be an algebraic character.

By Schur's lemma, the commuatant of ρ1(Γ') inside the algebraic group GLn / F, is a form of GL1 which over [formula] becomes isomorphic to the group of scalar matrices. By Hilbert Theorem 90, the commutant of ρ1(Γ') inside GLn(F) consists of precisely the scalar matrices.

For σ∈Γ, let T(σ) = ρ1(σ)- 1ρ2(σ)∈GLn(F). Now for τ∈Γ' and σ∈Γ, Thus T(σ) is equivariant with respect to the representation ρ1 |Γ', and hence is given by a scalar matrix χ(σ). Since χ(σ) is a scalar matrix, it follows that for σ, ~ τ∈Γ, χ(στ) = χ(σ)χ(τ), i.e., χ is character of Γ into the group of invertible elements F* of F, and ρ2(σ) = χ(σ)ρ1(σ) for all σ∈Γ.

It is clear from the proof that the lemma holds in the algebraic case too.

The proof indicates that the converse also holds: if there exists a character χ, then χ' is forced to be an invariant with respect to the action of Γ.

We summarize the results obtained so far when R is taken to be a special representation.

Let Γ be an abstract group, and F be a field of characteristic zero. Let ρ1, ~ ρ2: ~ Γ  →  GLn(F) be semisimple representations of Γ. Let R be a rational representation of GLn  →  GLm such that

[formula]

Then the following holds:

Suppose [formula] for some natural number k. Then there is a subgroup Γ' of finite index in Γ such that

[formula]

If further G01 acts absolutely irreducibly on Fn, then there is a character χ:Γ  →  F* such that,

[formula]

Suppose R = Ad be the adjoint representation of GLn. Assume further that the Lie algebra of the derived subgroup of G01 is simple and acts absolutely irreducibly on Fn. Then there is a character χ:Γ  →  F* such that,

[formula]

Let A be a finite set with a map, θ:A  →  Aut(Γ). Let R = Asθ. Assume further that the Lie algebra of the derived subgroup of G01 is simple and acts absolutely irreducibly on Fn. Then there is a character χ:Γ  →  F*, and an element a∈A such that

[formula]

Let ρ: = ρ1  ×  ρ2:Γ  →  (GLn  ×  GLn)(F) be the product representation. Let G = Gρ. Continue to denote by ρi the two projection morphisms from G to GLn.

Applying the above Propositions [\ref=prop:tensorconn], [\ref=prop:sym] and [\ref=tensorsimple] to G0 and Lemma [\ref=lem:extension] (where the role of Γ' is played by Gd which is a characteristic subgroup of G0), we obtain the theorem for the algebraic group G. Upon restricting back to Γ we obtain the theorem for any abstract group.

Tensor powers of Induced representations: the nonconnected case

The foregoing results allow us to recover representations on the full group Γ itself rather than recovering representations upto restriction to subgroups of finite index, provided that the connected component G01 of the algebric envelope of the image ρ1(Γ) acts absolutely irreducibly on Fn. As Examples [\ref=FG] and [\ref=blasius] show, it is not possible in general to recover representations upto twisting by characters for the full group Γ. In order to get some positive results even when G01 does not act absolutely irreducibly on Fn, we restrict to a specific situation keeping in mind the application to recovering CM forms from knowing the equality of 'tensor powers' of such forms. In particular, such representations are induced from a subgroup of finite index. We first present another application of the algebraic machinery.

Let G be an algebraic group over a characteristic zero base field F, and let ρ1,ρ2 be finite dimensional semisimple representations of G into GLn. Suppose that

[formula]

for some k  ≥  1. Then if ρ1 is irreducible, so is ρ2.

The proof follows by base changing to complex numbers and considering the characters χ1,χ2 of the representations restricted to a maximal compact subgroup. The characters differ by a root of unity in each connected component, and hence <  χ1,χ1 >  =  < χ2,χ2  >  . Hence it follows by Schur orthogonality relations that if one of the representations is irreducible, so is the other.

We continue with the hypothesis of the above proposition. By Proposition [\ref=prop:tensorconn], we can assume that ρ1|G0 and ρ2|G0 are isomorphic, which we will denote by ρ0. Let Φ: = G / G0 be the group of connected components of G. For φ∈Φ, let Gφ denote the corresponding connected component (identity component is G0). The groups G and Φ act on the collection of representations of G0:

[formula]

where r is a representation of G0. The action does not depend on the choice of gφ∈Gφ. Write

[formula]

where ri are the representations on the isotypical components, and I is the indexing set of the isotypical components of ρ(0). Fix i0∈I, and define G' to be the stabilizer of ri0 in G. With these assumptions we have the following consequence of Clifford theory:

Let G be an algebraic group over a characteristic zero base field F, and let ρ1,ρ2 be finite dimensional semisimple representations of G into GLn. Suppose that

[formula]

for some k  ≥  1. Assume further that either ρ1 or ρ2 is absolutely irreducible. Then

[formula]

are induced representations respectively from representations r1', ~ r2' of the subgroup G' of G.

Assume now that the constituents ri of ρ0 are absolutely irreducible, i.e, the irreducible representations occur with multiplicity one. In the notation of the above Proposition [\ref=prop:clifford], the assumption of multiplicity one on ρ0, implies that [formula] for some character χ∈Hom(G',GL1) trivial upon restriction to G0. Assuming the hypothesis of Proposition [\ref=tensorirr], we would like to know whether ρ2 and ρ1 differ by a character. This amounts to knowing that the character χ extends to a character of G, since the representations are induced. Assume from now onwards that G' is normal in G. Then the question of extending χ amounts first to showing that χ is invariant and then to show that invariant characters extend.

We rephrase the problem in a different language, with the hope that it may shed further light on the question. For σ∈G, let T(σ) = ρ1(σ)- 1ρ2(σ) be as in Lemma [\ref=lem:extension]. The calculations of Lemma [\ref=lem:extension] with now σ∈G,τ∈G0, show that T(σ) takes values in the commutant S of the image of ρ0, trivial when restricted to G0. Since we have assumed that ρ1 is irreducible, Φ = G / G0 acts on S via σ1 transitively as a permutation representation on indexing set I. Hence I can be taken to be G / G' and S is isomorphic to the induced module IndGG'(1G'), where the 1G' denotes the trivial one dimensional representation of G'. We have for σ,τ∈G,

[formula]

i.e, T is a one cocycle on G with values in S. Since S is induced, the 'restriction' map H1(G,S)  →  H1(G',F*) is an isomorphism. The invariants of the G-action on S is given by the diagonal F* sitting inside S, and the composite map, Hom(G,F*)  →  H1(G,S)  →  Hom(G',F*) is the restriction map. To say that χ extends to a character of G, amounts to knowing that χ lies in the image of this composite map.

We consider the example given by Blasius [\cite=blasius94] in this context. Let n be an odd prime, and let Hn be the finite Heisenberg group, with generators A, ~ B, ~ C subject to the relations: An = Bn = Cn = 1, ~ AC = CA, ~ BC = CB, ~ AB = CBA. Let [formula] be a basis for [formula], and let ξn be a primitive nth root of unity. For each integer a coprime to n, define the representation [formula] by, where the notation is that en + 1 = e1. It can be seen that ρa are irreducible representations, and that the corresponding projective representations for any pair of integers a, ~ b not congruent modulo n, are inequivalent. Further for any element h∈Hn, the images of ρa(h) and ρb(h) in [formula] are conjugate. Hence it follows that for some positive integer k (which we can take to be n) the representations Tk(ρa) and Tk(ρb) are isomorphic.

Let T be the abelian normal subgroup of index n generated by A and C. There exists a character χab of T such that [formula]. From the theory of induced representations, it can be further checked that ρa|T has multiplicity one, and that ρa is induced from a character ψa of T. However we have that there does not exist any character η of Hn such that [formula].

With this example in mind, we now present a proposition in the positive direction (which applies in particular to CM forms of weight ≥  2):

With notations and hypothesis as in Proposition [\ref=prop:clifford], assume further the following:

the subgroup G' is normal in G.

the isotypical components of ρ1 restricted to G0 are one dimensional.

Let χ be a character of G' such that [formula]. Then χ is invariant with respect to the action of G on the characters of G'. In particular, if invariant characters of G' extend to invariant characters of G (which happens if G / G' is cyclic), then there is a character χ of G such that,

[formula]

Restricting ρ1 and ρ2 to G', have by our assumptions

[formula]

where χ is a character of G' trivial on G0, and r1', ~ r2' are characters of G'. Let τ be an element of G - G'. If χ  ≠  χτ, choose an element θ of G' such that χ(θ)  ≠  χτ(θ). Choose an element gθ∈Gθ. Since Gθ is connected, we obtain from our assumption Tk(ρ1)≃Tk(ρ2), that for some [formula],

[formula]

for all y∈G0. But the characters rφ1 of G0 are linearly independent, and hence the above equality forces the character χ to be invariant.

It seems possible that the above proposition holds without the second assumption that r1 be a character.

Strong multiplicity one

Let K be a global field. Denote by ΣK the set of places of K. For a nonarchimedean place v of K, let [formula] denote the corresponding prime ideal of OK, and Nv the norm of v be the number of elements of the finite field [formula]. The upper density ud(P) of a set P of primes of K, is defined to be the ratio,

[formula]

Suppose L is a finite Galois extension of K, with Galois group G(L / K). Let S denote a subset of ΣK, containing the archimedean places together with the set of places of K which ramify in L. For each place v of K not in S, and a place w of L lying over v, we have a canonical Frobenius element σw in G(L / K), defined by the following property:

[formula]

The set {σw|w|v} form the Frobenius conjugacy class in G(L / K), which we continue to denote by σv.

Let M denote a connected, reductive algebraic group defined over F, and let ρ be a continous representation of GK into M(F), where F is a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic l, where l  ≠  char(K). Let L denote the fixed field of q by the kernel of ρ. Write [formula] where Lα are finite extensions of K. ρ is said to be unramified outside a set of primes S of K, if each of the extensions Lα is an unramified extension of K outside S.

We will assume henceforth that all our linear l-adic representations of GK are continuous and semisimple, since we need to determine a linear representation from it's character. By the results of [\cite=KR], it follows that the set of ramified primes is of density zero, and hence arguments involving density as in [\cite=rajan98], go through essentially unchanged. Hence in what follows, S will indicate a a set of primes of density zero, containing the ramified primes of the (finite) number of l-adic representations under consideration, and the archimedean places of K.

Let w be a valuation on L extending a valuation [formula] The Frobenius elements at the various finite layers for the valuation w|Lα patch together to give raise to the Frobenius element σw∈G(L / K), and a Frobenius conjugacy class σv∈G(L / K). Thus ρ(σw) (resp. ρ(σv)) is a well defined element (resp. conjugacy class) in M(F). If ρ:GK  →  GLm(F) is a linear representation, let χρ denote the associated character. χρ(σv) is well defined for v a place of K not in S.

We recall here the results of [\cite=rajan98]. Suppose

[formula]

are continuous, semisimple representations of the Galois group GK into GLn(F), unramified outside a set S (as above) of places containing the archimedean places of K. Let T be a subset of the set of places ΣK of K satisfying,

[formula]

Consider the following two hypothesis on the upper density of T, depending on the representations ρ1 and ρ2:

[formula]

where ci = |Gi) / G0i| is the number of connected components of Gi. As a consequence of the refinements of strong multiplicity one proved in [\cite=rajan98], we obtain

i) If T satisfies DH1, then ρ1≃ρ2.

ii) If T satisfies DH2, then there is a finite Galois extension L of K, such that ρ1 |GL≃ρ2 |GL. The connected component G02 is conjugate to G01. In particular if either G1 or G2 is connected and ud(T) is positive, then there is a finite Galois extension L of K, such that ρ1 |GL≃ρ2 |GL.

For the sake of completeness of exposition, we present a brief outline of the proof and refer to [\cite=rajan98] for more details. Let ρ  =  ρ1  ×  ρ2. Let G denote the Zariski closure of the image ρ1(GK)  ×  ρ2(GK). Let G0 denote the connected component of the identity in G, and let Φ: = G / G0 be the group of connected components of G. For φ∈Φ, let Gφ denote the corresponding connected component.

Consider the algebraic subscheme

[formula]

It is known that if C is a closed, analytic subset of G, stable under conjugation by G and of dimension strictly smaller than that of G, then the set of Frobenius conjugacy classes lying in C is of density 0. Using this it follows that the collection of Frobenius conjugacy classes lying in X has a density equal to

[formula]

Since this last condition is algebraically defined, the above expression can be calculated after base changing to [formula]. Let J denote a maximal compact subgroup of [formula], and let p1, ~ p2 denote the two natural projections of the product GLm  ×  GLm. Assume that p1 and p2 give raise to inequivalent representations of J. (i) follows from the inequlities

[formula]

where dμ(j) denotes a normalized Haar measure on J. The first inequality follows from the orthogonality relations for characters. For the second inequality, we observe that the eigenvalues of p1(j) and p2(j) are roots of unity, and hence

[formula]

Combining this with the expression for the density λ given by equation [\ref=algdensity] gives us the second inequality.

To prove (ii), it is enough to show that H0  ⊂  X. Let c1 < c2. The density hypothesis implies together with the expression ([\ref=algdensity]) for the density, that there is some element of the form [formula]. The proof concludes by observing that the only element in the unitary group [formula] with trace equal to m is the identity matrix, and hence the connected component of the idenity in J (or H) is contained inside X.

In the automorphic context, assuming the Ramanujan-Petersson conjectures, it is possible to obtain the inequalities in ([\ref=orthogonality]), by analogous arguments, and thus a proof of Ramakrishnan's conjecture in the automorphic context. The first inequality follows from replacing the orthogonality relations for characters of compact groups, by the Rankin-Selberg convolution of L-functions, and amounts to studying the behvior at s = 1 of the logarithm of the function,

[formula]

where π1 and π2 are unitary, automorphic representations of [formula] of a number field K, and 1,  ~  2 are the contragredient representations of π1 and π2. The second inequality follows from the Ramanujan hypothesis. For more details we refer to [\cite=Ra1].

Applications to Modular Forms

As a corollary to Theorem [\ref=thm:special] and Proposition [\ref=prop:rec-ind], we give an application to two dimensional representations:

Let K be a number field and let F be a non-archimedean local field of residue characteristic l. Let ρ1,  ~  ρ2:GK  →  GL2(F) be continuous l-adic representations as above. Suppose that the algebraic envelope G1 of the image ρ1(GK) contains a maximal torus. Let R:GL2  →  GLm be either the symmetric kth power representation Sk or the kth tensor power representation Tk of GL(2). Let T be a subset of the set of places ΣK of K satisfying,

[formula]

where S is a finite set of places of K containing the archimedean places of K and the places of K where either ρ1 or ρ2 is ramified. Then the following holds:

Assume that the algebraic envelope of the image of ρ1 contains SL2. If ud(T) is positive, then there exists a character χ:GK  →  F* such that [formula].

Suppose that ud(T)  >  1 / 2. Then there exists a finite extension L of K and a character χ:GL  →  F* such that [formula].

Suppose R = Tk:GL2  →  GL2k. Assume that ud(T) > 1 - 2- (2m + 1). that the representations Tk(ρ1) and Tk(ρ2) satisfy DH1, for some positive integer k and ρ1 is irreducible. Then there exists a character χ:GK  →  F* such that [formula].

Part 1) follows from Part (1) of Theorem [\ref=thm:special]. Part 2) follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:smo] and Part (1) of Theorem [\ref=thm:special]. We need to prove Part (3) only for CM forms. This from Theorem [\ref=thm:smo] and Proposition [\ref=prop:rec-ind] (since the representations are two dimensional, the subgroup G' as in Proposition [\ref=prop:rec-ind] is of index 2 in G, hence normal in G).

We now give the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:mf] stated in the introduction.

For a newform f of weight k, let

[formula]

be the l-adic representations of [formula] associated by the work of Shimura, Ihara and Deligne. It has been shown by Ribet in [\cite=Ri], that the representation ρf is semisimple, and the Zariski closure Gf of the image [formula] satisfies the following properties:

If the weight of f is at least two, then Gf contains a maximal torus.

If f is a non-CM form, then Gf = GL2.

Theorem [\ref=thm:mf] follows by Corollary [\ref=cor:twodim]

A similar statement as below can be made for the class of Hilbert modular forms too. A more general statement can be made when the forms do not have complex multiplication, where we can take R to be an arbitrary rational representation of GL2 with kernel contained inside the centre of GL2, rather than restrict ourselves to symmetric and tensor powers.

We now consider an application to Asai representations associated to holomorphic Hilbert modular forms. With notation as in Example [\ref=asai], assume further that K / k is a quadratic extension of totally real number fields, and that ρ1,  ~  ρ2 are l-adic representations attached respectively to holomorphic Hilbert modular forms f1, ~ f2 over K. Let σ denote a generator of the Galois group of K / k, and further assume that f1 (resp. f2) is not isomorphic to any twist of fσ1 (resp. fσ2 by a character, where fσ1 denotes the form f1 twisted by σ. Then the twisted tensor automorphic representations of [formula], defined by [formula] (with an abuse of notation) is irreducible. Further it has been shown to be modular by D. Ramakrishnan [\cite=DR2], and descend to define automorphic representations denoted respectively by As(f1) and As(f2) on [formula]. As a simple consequence of Part d) of Theorem [\ref=thm:special], we have the following corollary:

Assume further that f1 and f2 are non-CM forms, and that the Fourier coefficients of As(f1) and As(f2) are equal at a positive density of places of k, which split in K. Then there is an idele-class character χ of K satisfying χχσ = 1 such that,
