Entropies, volumes, and Einstein metrics

Introduction

In his seminal paper on bounded cohomology [\cite=gromov], Gromov introduced both the simplicial volume and the minimal volume of manifolds. The former provides a lower bound for the latter, but this lower bound never seems to be sharp. Therefore, one looks at various intermediate invariants, many of which are related to some sort of entropy. In Section [\ref=s:chain] of this paper we discuss a chain of inequalities between such intermediate invariants which centers on the volume entropy, or asymptotic volume. Nothing is proved, and no originality is claimed for the material of Section [\ref=s:chain]. We simply collect known results in a coherent way that we find useful.

In Section [\ref=s:Einstein] we prove that a closed oriented four-manifold X admitting an Einstein metric must satisfy the inequality

[formula]

where χ(X) denotes the Euler characteristic, σ(X) the signature, and λ(X) the volume entropy. We also characterize the case of equality.

Whenever one has a positive lower bound for the volume entropy, the above inequality implies a particular improvement of the classical Hitchin-Thorpe inequality [\cite=HT]

[formula]

Two specific cases of lower bounds for the entropy which we discuss in Section [\ref=s:Einstein] are the following. First, from Section [\ref=s:chain], the spherical volume and the simplicial volume give lower bounds for the entropy. In the case of the simplicial volume this leads to

[formula]

which improves on our result in [\cite=GHT]. Second, using the lower bound for the entropy arising from the existence of maps to locally symmetric spaces of rank one proved by Besson-Courtois-Gallot [\cite=BCG], we deduce the results of Sambusetti [\cite=S]. Thus, the obstruction to the existence of Einstein metrics formulated in our main theorem subsumes all the known obstructions which are homotopy invariant. See [\cite=K] [\cite=monopoles] for obstructions which are not homotopy invariant.

It is remarkable that until now the obstructions to Einstein metrics arising from the simplicial volume and those arising from [\cite=BCG] have been treated as separate, unrelated obstructions, cf. [\cite=BCG] [\cite=S], although entropy appears already in Gromov's paper [\cite=gromov] as an interpolation between simplicial volume and minimal volume. With hindsight we note that it was long after Gromov's paper that Babenko [\cite=B1] [\cite=B2] [\cite=B3] proved that the entropy is a topological invariant sharing properties with the signature in particular, see Remark [\ref=r:B]. With this in mind, and with the prominent role entropy plays in the work of Besson-Courtois-Gallot [\cite=BCG0] [\cite=BCG], the result we prove here is completely natural.

Concerning the topological invariance of entropies and volumes, recall that Bessières [\cite=Be] has given examples of high-dimensional manifolds which are homeomorphic, but have different minimal volumes, both of them positive. In Section [\ref=s:exotic] we exhibit another way in which the minimal volume fails to be invariant under homeomorphisms: there are pairs of homeomorphic four-manifolds for which the minimal volume is zero for one, and is positive for the other. As the vanishing of the minimal volume implies the vanishing of all real characteristic numbers, such examples cannot be simply connected. In fact, our examples are parallelizable and exhibit for the first time the existence of exotic smooth structures on parallelizable closed four-manifolds.

Entropies and volumes

Let M be a connected closed oriented manifold of dimension n. We shall discuss the following chain of inequalities between its topological invariants:

[formula]

This chain appears in [\cite=PP], without T(M), and with an unspecified constant in front of ||M||. The inequalities involving T(M) are from [\cite=BCG0], where T(M) was defined.

There seems to be no known example of a manifold with T(M) > 0 for which the first inequality is sharp. All the other inequalities are sharp for surfaces of genus g  ≥  2, where

[formula]

We now explain the terms in [\eqref=e:main], and the sources for the different inequalities.

Simplicial volume

The simplicial volume was introduced by Gromov [\cite=gromov]. Let c = Σiriσi be a chain with real coefficients ri, where σi:Δk  →  X are singular k-simplices in M. One defines the norm of c to be

[formula]

If [formula], set

[formula]

where the infimum is taken over all cycles representing α. This is a seminorm on the homology.

The simplicial volume is defined to be the norm of the fundamental class, and is denoted

[formula]

Gromov [\cite=gromov] has shown that the simplicial volume of M is determined by the image of its fundamental class under the classifying map f:M  →  Bπ1(M) of the universal covering. This implies that the simplicial volume is homotopy-invariant, and that it is a bordism invariant of ∈Ωn(Bπ1(M)).

Spherical volume

The spherical volume was introduced by Besson-Courtois-Gallot [\cite=BCG0].

Let [formula] be the universal covering of M. Fix a positive π1(M)-invariant measure [formula] on [formula] that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Denote by (S∞,can) the unit sphere in the Hilbert space L2(,) endowed with the metric induced by the scalar product. For every π1(M)-equivariant immersion Φ:  →  S∞ we have an induced metric Φ*(can) which descends to M, and we write vol(Φ) for Vol(M,Φ*(can)).

The spherical volume of M is defined to be

[formula]

This does not depend on the choice of measure [formula], see [\cite=BCG0].

Besson, Courtois and Gallot proved the first inequality in [\eqref=e:main] as Theorem 3.16 in [\cite=BCG0].

Volume entropy

For a Riemannian metric g on M consider the lift [formula] to the universal covering [formula]. For an arbitrary basepoint p∈ consider the limit

[formula]

where B(p,R) is the ball of radius R around p in [formula] with respect to [formula], and the volume is taken with respect to [formula] as well. After earlier work by Efremovich, Shvarts, Milnor [\cite=Mi] and others, Manning [\cite=M] showed that the limit exists and is independent of p. It follows from [\cite=Mi] that λ(M,g) > 0 if and only if π1(M) has exponential growth.

We call λ(M,g) the volume entropy of the metric g, and define the volume entropy of M to be

[formula]

This sometimes vanishes even when λ(M,g) > 0 for every g. The normalization of the total volume is necessary because of the scaling properties of λ(M,g).

Any metric on M can be scaled so that [formula]. By the Bishop volume comparison theorem, cf. [\cite=BC], this implies λ(M,g)  ≤  1. Setting

[formula]

we have Vol(M,ĝ) = 1 and λ(M,ĝ)  =  Vol(M,g)1 / nλ(M,g)  ≤  Vol(M,g)1 / n, so that

[formula]

This is not an equality because the Bishop estimate is not sharp, except for metrics of constant sectional curvature [\cite=BC].

Babenko has shown that the volume entropy λ(M) is homotopy invariant [\cite=B1], and is also an invariant of the bordism class ∈Ωn(Bπ1(M)), cf. [\cite=B3].

The second inequality in [\eqref=e:main] follows from Theorem 3.8 of Besson-Courtois-Gallot [\cite=BCG0].

Topological entropy

For a Riemannian metric g on M consider the topological entropy h(M,g) of its geodesic flow as a dynamical system on the unit sphere bundle, cf. [\cite=M]. The topological entropy of M is defined to be

[formula]

Here again the normalization of the total volume is necessary because of scaling properties.

Manning [\cite=M] proved λ(M,g)  ≤  h(M,g) for all closed M. Taking the infimum over all metrics with normalized volume yields the third inequality in [\eqref=e:main].

Minimal volume

The minimal volume was introduced by Gromov [\cite=gromov]. It is defined by

[formula]

where Kg denotes the sectional curvature of g.

It is known that the minimal volume is a very sensitive invariant of M, which depends on the smooth structure in an essential way. Bessières [\cite=Be] has given examples of pairs of high-dimensional manifolds which are homeomorphic, but have different positive minimal volumes. In Section [\ref=s:exotic] we shall use Seiberg-Witten theory to show that the vanishing of the minimal volume is not invariant under homeomorphisms.

Manning [\cite=M2] proved that for a closed Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded by |Kg|  ≤  k the topological entropy is bounded by

[formula]

By rescaling, this implies the last of the inequalities in [\eqref=e:main], cf. [\cite=P] p. 129.

Einstein metrics on four-manifolds

We now prove the following constraint on the topology of four-manifolds admitting Einstein metrics.

Let X be a closed oriented Einstein 4-manifold. Then

[formula]

where χ(X) denotes the Euler characteristic, σ(X) the signature, and λ(X) the volume entropy.

Equality in [\eqref=eq:GHT] occurs if and only if every Einstein metric on X is flat, is non-flat locally Calabi-Yau, or is of constant negative sectional curvature.

Note that the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:GHT] is an invariant of the cobordism class ∈Ω4(Bπ1(X)), where f:X  →  Bπ1(X) is the classifying map of the universal covering. For the signature this is due to Thom, and for the volume entropy it was proved by Babenko in [\cite=B3]. Rationally, one has the well-known isomorphism

[formula]

The second summand is responsible for the signature term (=first Pontryagin number) and the first one for the entropy term in [\eqref=eq:GHT].

By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem the Euler characteristic of a closed oriented Riemannian 4-manifold (X,g) is

[formula]

where sg is the scalar curvature, W is the Weyl tensor, and Ric0 is the trace-less Ricci tensor of g. For an Einstein metric this reduces to

[formula]

Thus χ(X)  ≥  0, with equality if and only if every Einstein metric on X is flat.

If the scalar curvature of an Einstein metric is positive, then π1(X) is finite by Myers's theorem and the volume entropy vanishes, so that [\eqref=eq:GHT] reduces to the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality obtained by comparing [\eqref=eq:GB] with the Chern-Weil formula

[formula]

If the scalar curvature is zero, then the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem implies that either the fundamental group is finite, or the Euler characteristic vanishes. In the latter case the Einstein metric is flat and the volume growth is only polynomial, so that in both cases the volume entropy vanishes and we are done as before.

If the scalar curvature is negative, we scale the metric so that [formula]. Then the first term in [\eqref=eq:GB] is

[formula]

using [\eqref=e:Bishop]. Using the Chern-Weil formula [\eqref=eq:CW] the second term is

[formula]

This completes the proof of [\eqref=eq:GHT]. Equality cannot hold in the case of positive scalar curvature because in this case we threw away the scalar curvature term in [\eqref=eq:GB]. In the case of zero scalar curvature the entropy vanishes and the discussion of equality reduces to the corresponding discussion for the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality, see Hitchin [\cite=HT]. The conclusion is that every Einstein metric is flat or (up to choosing the orientation suitably) locally Calabi-Yau but non-flat. For negative scalar curvature equality in [\eqref=eq:GHT] implies equality in [\eqref=eq:first], so that λ(X) > 0 and every Einstein metric on X has to be entropy-minimizing. Moreover, it has to give equality in the Bishop estimate [\eqref=e:Bishop], and this only happens for metrics of constant negative curvature, cf. [\cite=BC]. Thus these are the only candidates for equality. They do indeed give equality because they are conformally flat and therefore [\eqref=eq:second] is an equality for them, and they are entropy-minimizing by the celebrated result of Besson-Courtois-Gallot [\cite=BCG].

The three cases giving rise to equality in [\eqref=eq:GHT] correspond to the vanishing of all three terms in [\eqref=eq:GHT] for flat manifolds, to the vanishing of λ(X) only for Calabi-Yaus, and to the vanishing of σ(X) only in the hyperbolic case. After earlier, unpublished, work of Calabi, Charlap-Sah, and Levine, the closed orientable flat four-manifolds were classified by Hillman [\cite=Hil] and by Wagner [\cite=wagner], who showed that there are 27 distinct ones. By Bieberbach's theorems, all these manifolds are finite quotients of T4. In the locally Calabi-Yau case, Hitchin [\cite=HT] showed that the only possible manifolds are the K3 surface and its quotients by certain free actions of [formula] and of [formula]. In the hyperbolic case there are of course infinitely many manifolds.

Combining [\eqref=e:main] with Theorem [\ref=t:GHT] we obtain the following improvement of the Gromov-Hitchin-Thorpe inequality proved in [\cite=GHT]:

Let X be a closed oriented Einstein 4-manifold. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=t:GHT] together with the work of Besson-Courtois-Gallot [\cite=BCG] implies the following:

Let X be a closed oriented Einstein 4-manifold.

If X admits a map of non-zero degree d to a real hyperbolic manifold Y, then

[formula]

with equality only if X is also real hyperbolic.

If X admits a map of non-zero degree d to a complex hyperbolic manifold Y, then

[formula]

To prove [\eqref=eq:real] we combine [\eqref=eq:GHT] with the inequality

[formula]

from [\cite=BCG]. Here g0 is the hyperbolic metric on Y normalized so that K =  - 1. With this normalization the Gauss-Bonnet formula [\eqref=eq:GB] gives [formula] so that 34Vol(Y,g0) = 108π2χ(Y).

In the case of equality X must itself be hyperbolic, by the equality case of Theorem [\ref=t:GHT].

For maps to complex hyperbolic manifolds one uses the corresponding statement from [\cite=BCG]. Again λ(X)4  ≥  d  ·  λ(Y)4 and the hyperbolic metric on Y is entropy-minimizing. Thus one only has to check the proportionality factors between the fourth power of the entropy and the Euler characteristic, and the weak form of [\eqref=eq:cx] follows. By Theorem [\ref=t:GHT] equality cannot occur in this case.

It would be interesting to know whether [\eqref=eq:GHT] remains true if we replace the volume entropy λ by the topological entropy h, cf. [\eqref=e:main]. The results of Paternain and Petean [\cite=PPMRL] [\cite=PP] are very suggestive in this regard. While the volume entropy can only be positive for manifolds with fundamantal groups of exponential growth, the topological entropy may be positive even for simply connected manifolds. Unlike the volume entropy, the topological entropy is not known to be homotopy invariant. Notice that we can definitely not replace λ4 by a positive multiple of [formula], because the K3 surface satisfies [formula], and has positive [formula] as its Euler characteristic and signature are non-zero. We will show in the next section that the non-vanishing of the minimal volume depends in an essential way on the smooth structure. That the existence of an Einstein metric depends on the smooth structure was first shown in [\cite=K].

Minimal volumes and smooth structures

In this section we show that vanishing of the minimal volume is a property of the smooth structure, which is not invariant under homeomorphisms. The proof below actually shows that one can change the smooth structure of a manifold with a smooth free circle action so that for the new smooth structure any smooth circle action must have fixed points.

For every k  ≥  0 the manifold Xk = k(S2  ×  S2)  #  (1 + k)(S1  ×  S3) with its standard smooth structure has zero minimal volume.

If k is odd and large enough, then there are infinitely many pairwise non-diffeomorphic smooth manifolds Yk homeomorphic to Xk, all of which have strictly positive minimal volume.

Note that X0 = S1  ×  S3 has obvious free circle actions, and therefore collapses with bounded sectional curvature. To see that all Xk have vanishing minimal volume it suffices to construct fixed-point-free circle actions on them.

The product S2  ×  S2 has a diagonal effective circle action which on each factor is rotation around the north-south axis. It has four fixed pints, and the linearization of the action induces one orientation at two of the fixed points, and the other orientation at the remaining two. The induced action on the boundary of an S1-invariant small ball around each of the fixed points is the Hopf action on S3. By taking equivariant connected sums at fixed points, pairing fixed points at which the linearizations give opposite orientations, we obtain effective circle actions with 2 + 2k fixed points on the connected sum k(S2  ×  S2) for every k  ≥  1. Now we have 1 + k fixed points at which the linearization induces one orientation, and 1 + k at which it induces the other orientation. Then making equivariant self-connected sums at pairs of fixed points with linearizations inducing opposite orientations we finally obtain a free circle action on Xk = k(S2  ×  S2)  #  (1 + k)(S1  ×  S3).

If k is odd and large enough, then there are symplectic manifolds Zk homeomorphic (but not diffeomorphic) to k(S2  ×  S2), see for example [\cite=HKW]. By the construction given in [\cite=HKW], we may assume that Zk contains the Gompf nucleus of an elliptic surface. By performing logarithmic transformations inside this nucleus, we can vary the smooth structures on the Zk in such a way that the number of Seiberg-Witten basic classes with numerical Seiberg-Witten invariant =    ±  1 becomes arbitrarily large, cf. Theorem 8.7 of [\cite=FSrat] and Example 3.5 of [\cite=monopoles].

Consider Yk = Zk  #  (1 + k)(S1  ×  S3). This is clearly homeomorphic to Xk. Although the numerical Seiberg-Witten invariants of Yk must vanish, cf. [\cite=KMT] [\cite=Bourbaki], we claim that each of the basic classes with numerical Seiberg-Witten invariant =    ±  1 on Zk gives rise to a monopole class on Yk, that is the characteristic class of a [formula]-structure for which the monopole equations have a solution for every Riemannian metric on Yk. There are two ways to see this. One can extract our claim from the connected sum formula [\cite=B] for the stable cohomotopy refinement of Seiberg-Witten invariants introduced by Bauer and Furuta [\cite=BF], cf. [\cite=F]. Alternatively, one uses the invariant defined by the homology class of the moduli space of solutions to the monopole equations, as in [\cite=Bourbaki]. This means that the first homology of the manifold is used, and here this is enough to obtain a non-vanishing invariant. Using this invariant, our claim follows from Proposition 2.2 of Ozsváth-Szabó [\cite=OS].

As Yk has non-torsion monopole classes c with c2 = 2χ(Zk) + 3σ(Zk) = 4 + 4k > 0, the bound

[formula]

where sg is the scalar curvature of any Riemannian metric g, shows that Yk cannot collapse with bounded scalar curvature, cf. [\cite=monopoles]. A fortiori it cannot collapse with bounded sectional curvature, and so its minimal volume is strictly positive.

The monopole classes we constructed on Yk are all generic monopole classes in the sense of [\cite=monopoles]. By Lemma 2.4 of loc. cit. each manifold has at most finitely many such classes. As we can change the smooth structure to make the number of generic monopole classes arbitrarily large, we have infinitely many distinct smooth structures we can choose for Yk.
