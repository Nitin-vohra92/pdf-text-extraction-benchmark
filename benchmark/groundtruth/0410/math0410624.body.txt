On uniformities and uniformly continuous functions on factor-spaces of topological groups

The left uniform structure of a topological group G, which we will denote by Ul(G), has a basis of entourages of the form

[formula]

where V is a neighborhood of the identity. Similarly, the right uniform structure will be denoted by Ur(G) and has a basis of the form

[formula]

A real valued function on a topological group G is left uniformly continuous if it is uniformly continuous with respect to the left uniform structure. Similarly, for right uniform continuity. Plainly every left uniformly continuous real valued function is right uniformly continuous and vice versa, whenever left and right uniform structures coincide. The converse is still unknown. This problem is known as Itzkowitz's problem.

The question has been answered in the affirmative for particular classes of topological groups, including locally compact groups, metrisable groups, locally connected groups and some other classes of groups. (see [\cite=hansell] [\cite=dez] [\cite=kow] [\cite=wit] [\cite=uniform] [\cite=mil] [\cite=prota]).

Itzkowitz's question can be stated not only for topological groups but for their homogeneous factor-spaces, because they also support two natural uniform structures (although not necessarily compatible with the factor topology), the left and the right ones, see [\cite=walter]. Do these two uniform structures in G / H coincide as soon as every left uniformly continuous real valued function on G / H is right uniformly continuous, where H is a subgroup of the group G? The aim of this paper is to answer the question on the negative, by constructing a counterexample. Notice that on our example, both uniform structures on G / H are in fact compatible.

Let H be a subgroup of a topological group G. Let π be the natural quotient mapping of G onto G / H. The left uniform structure, Ul(G / H), on G / H is the finest uniformity such that the quotient mapping π:(G,Ul(G))  ↦  G / H is uniformly continuous. Similarly, the right uniform structure, Ur(G / H), on G / H is the finest uniformity such that the mapping π:(G,Ur(G))  ↦  G / H is uniformly continuous. It should be emphasized that if G / H is equipped with the indiscrete uniformity, then π is uniformly continuous. Thus the definition always makes sense.

The uniform structure Ur(G / H) is also called the standard uniformity in [\cite=atkin]. It is worth noticing that the images of Ur(G) and Ul(G) under π  ×  π are included in Ul(G / H) and Ul(G / H) respectively.

Let H be an open subgroup of a topological group G. The uniform structure Ul(G / H) is discrete.

Since H is a neighborhood of the identity of G, the image of the entourage of the diagonal Hł under (π  ×  π) is the set {(fH,gH):f,g∈G,f- 1g∈H}  =  {(fH,gH):f,g∈G,g∈fH}  =  {(fH,fH):f∈G}. The latter set is the diagonal of G / H  ×  G / H. Hence Ul(G / H) is just the discrete uniform structure.

Let X be a set. Let SX denote the symmetric group on X and let γ be a partition of X. Define

[formula]

Plainly [formula] is a subgroup of SX.

The subgroups [formula] as γ runs over all partitions of X with [formula] form a neighborhood basis for a Hausdorff group topology on SX, which we will denote by [formula]

Let [formula]X[formula] Since, for any γ∈Γ, [formula] is a group, [formula].

Let γ∈Γ and [formula]. Define a cover β of X as follows: B∈β if and only if B = g(A), for some A in γ. Evidently β is in Γ and [formula]

If γ,β∈Γ, then define a cover α of X as follows: A set D is in α if and only if [formula] for some A∈γ and B∈β. Clearly α is in Γ and [formula]

Now the topology can be defined by taking the set

[formula]

as a basis of open neighborhoods of the identity.

If ι is the identity of SX and f∈SX not equal to ι, then there exists x∈X such that f(x)  ≠  x. Put [formula] Then clearly γ∈Γ and [formula]. This implies [formula] Hence SX is Hausdorff.

The [formula] topology on SX is finer than the pointwise convergence topology. For any finite subset M of X, let [formula] Clearly γ∈Γ and [formula]

If [formula], then one obtain just the discrete topology on SX Indeed γ  =  {x}x∈X is a partition of X, of cardinality [formula] so [formula] is just the identity of SX.

Let γ be any partition of a set X, with [formula]. Let [formula] It is easy to see that the collections of all sets of the Vγ is a basis for a uniform structure on X. Let denote this uniform structure by [formula].

If a set X and the real line [formula] are equipped with the uniformity [formula] and the additive uniformity, respectively, then every real valued function f on X is uniformly continuous.

Given a function [formula] define a partition γ of X as the collection of all sets [formula] If now x,y∈X and (x,y)∈Vγ then f(x) = f(y). Hence f is uniformly continuous.

Let a be arbitrary but fixed element of a set X and let γ be a partition of X. If b,c∈X then the following are equivalent.

There are g,f∈SX such that f- 1(γ) = g- 1(γ) and f(a) = b,g(a) = c.

There exists A∈γ such b,c∈A.

We will only prove (2) ⇒   (1) as the other implication is obvious. Let f∈SX such f(a) = b. Define g:X  ↦  X by

[formula]

Clearly g∈SX. Notice that f- 1(c) = g- 1(b),f- 1(b) = g- 1(c) and for each [formula]. It follows that that for each A∈γ,f- 1(A) = g- 1(A). That is f- 1(γ) = g- 1(γ).

For an a∈X, let Sta denote the subgroup of SX consisting of elements of SX that stabilize a. In our notation this is equal to Stγ, where [formula]. Notice that every such subgroup is open in the topology of pointwise convergence, and therefore in the topology [formula] as well.

Let a∈X be arbitrary. Denote H = Sta. If SX is endowed with the topology defined in [formula], then

[formula]

The group SX acts on both X and SX / Sta by (f,x)  ↦  f(x) and (f,gSta)  ↦  fgSta, respectively. Define a map Φ:SX / Sta  ↦  X by Φ(fSta) = f(a). This map can be easily shown to be well defined and the image of Sta under Φ is a.

The map Φ is equivariant, because if g∈SX and fSta∈SX / Sta then

[formula]

Moreover, Φ is a bijection: for every x∈X there is a f∈SX such that f(a) = x, together with the fact that every h∈Sta stabilizes the point a, imply Φ(fSta) = x. Also if Φ(fSta) = Φ(gSta), for some f,g∈SX, then f(a) = g(a) so that g- 1f(a) = a. Therefore g- 1f∈Sta and hence fSta = gSta.

Now for any partition γ of X with [formula], the set

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=tolu], the above set is equal to the set

[formula]

The group SX on a set X with cardinality greater than [formula] equipped with the topology in [formula] with its subgroup [formula] provides a negative answer to the generalization of Itzkowitz's question to factor-spaces.

Namely, every right uniformly continuous function on the factor-space SX / Sta is left uniformly continuous, yet the right and the left uniformities on SX / Sta are different. Indeed, Proposition [\ref=maile] implies that any real valued function on SX / H is uniformly continuous with respect to Ul(SX / H). At the same time Proposition [\ref=va] and Theorem [\ref=pahulu] assure that any such function is uniformly continuous with respect to Ur(SX / H). But Proposition [\ref=maile] Theorem [\ref=pahulu] show that these uniform structures are different.

Notice that both the left and the right uniformities on SX / H are compatible (they generate the discrete topology on SX / H, which is the quotient topology). This follows from Proposition [\ref=maile] and Theorem [\ref=pahulu].
