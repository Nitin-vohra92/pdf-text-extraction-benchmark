Singlet NN Regularization using a Boundary Condition for OPE and TPE potentials

While it is widely accepted that the NN-interaction is not well known at short distances and different NN potentials [\cite=Stoks:1993tb] disagree most below 0.5fm, there is an unanimous agreement on the fact that pion exchanges [\cite=Rentmeester:1999vw] govern their long distance behaviour in the spirit of an Effective Field Theory [\cite=Bedaque:2002mn]. Unfortunately, practical calculations [\cite=Rentmeester:1999vw] [\cite=Beane:2001bc] [\cite=Entem:2003ft] [\cite=Epelbaum:2004fk] require finite cut-offs, violating one-valuedness and renormalization group invariance [\cite=Birse:1998dk] in the non-perturbative low partial waves. In this talk we show how cut-offs can be removed in the simplest singlet 1S0 channel on the light of our recent results [\cite=Valderrama:2003np] [\cite=Valderrama:2004nb] where other (coupled) channels are also studied.

The Schrödinger equation in the 1S0 channel at a given momentum k, corresponding to an asymptotic scattering state reads

[formula]

where uk(r) and U(r) = MNV(r) are the reduced wave function and potential respectively. Long distance properties are encoded in the potential [formula] [\cite=Rentmeester:1999vw]. On the other hand, for regular potentials, U(r)  >   - 1 / 4r2, the short distance properties can be described by an energy dependent short distance boundary condition (BC),

[formula]

which can also be written in terms of a "short distance" phase shift δS(k) , as can be seen by setting the long distance contribution U(r) to zero. Strictly speaking δS(k) is unknown. In fact, the whole problem has to do with a long distance distortion of the short distance δS(k) through the pion exchange potential U(r) to produce the total phase shift δ(k). Although this may appear to be a hopeless program at first sight some information can be obtained via a low energy expansion of the short distance boundary condition. This is equivalent to an effective range (ER) expansion of δS(k),

[formula]

where αS, rS, are the short distance scattering length and effective range parameters respectively. The limit RS  →  0 has to be taken carefully because U(r) is singular at the origin. Obviously, this expansion can be pursued to any order in the momentum [\cite=Valderrama:2003np]. The expansion of Eq. ([\ref=eq:low]) carries over to the Schrödinger equation, Eq. ([\ref=eq:sch]), yielding

[formula]

where at LO we get

[formula]

and at NLO

[formula]

and so on. The standard way to proceed would be to integrate the equations from the origin (or a sufficiently small radius RS  →  0) and then to adjust the short distance parameters to get the proper threshold parameters, α and r0. An additional difficulty hinders the practical calculations; the strong and attractive singularities of the long distance potential at short distances (- C / r6 for TPE ) generate increasingly large oscillations of the wave function close to the origin, so that a extreme fine tunning of the BC is needed. In addition, the oscillations of the wave function enable the usage of semi-classical methods to improve on the accuracy in the short distance region.

Instead of the fitting procedure, one can simply integrate from infinity downwards, with a known value of α, r0 and so on, to the origin [\cite=Valderrama:2003np] [\cite=Valderrama:2004nb]. This provides the value of the short distance parameters, αS and rS for RS  →  0, and then one can use Eq. ([\ref=eq:sch]) to compute for any energy with a given truncated boundary condition. This procedure provides by definition the low energy parameters we started with and takes into account that the long range potential determines the form of the wave function at long distances. The only parameter in the procedure is the short distance radius RS which, unlike previous work [\cite=Rentmeester:1999vw], we remove it by taking the limit RS  →  0. Following this procedure we obtain Fig. [\ref=fig:phaseshift], for the theory without pions (ER), as well as the OPE and TPE potentials. The agreement to data [\cite=Stoks:1993tb] is good up to the region k  ~  mπ which corresponds to the two pion left cut.

Finally, the relation with other renormalization methods, such as the sharp momentum cut-off method [\cite=Birse:1998dk] used in the Lippmann Schwinger equation with [formula] can be established straightforwardly yielding

[formula]

where Λ  =  π / 2R. In Fig. ([\ref=fig:C0]) we plot the dependence of the renormalization constant at a given scale R. As we see at the OPE level, C0  →  0, which corresponds to an ultraviolet fixed point. This behaviour is changed for TPE to an oscillating C0 with a varying period corresponding to a limit cycle, illustrating the non-trivial evolution of the BC.
