Integral non-hyperbolike surgeries

Introduction

The well-known Hyperbolic Dehn surgery Theorem due to Thurston [\cite=Th] says that each hyperbolic knot admits only finitely many Dehn surgeries yielding non-hyperbolic manifolds. A lot of works have been done to study how many, when and on which knots such exceptional surgeries can occur. See [\cite=B] for a survey.

About the number of exceptional surgeries, it is conjectured that they are at most TEN, and the knot admitting ten is only the figure-eight knot in the 3-sphere S3. See [\cite=K] for a detail. In [\cite=HK], Hodgson and Kerckhoff achieved the first universal upper bound SIXTY. In [\cite=A] and [\cite=L], Agol and Lackenby independently showed that there are at most TWELVE surgeries yielding non-hyperbolike 3-manifolds. Here a 3-manifold is called non-hyperbolike (in the sense of Agol) if it is reducible or does not have infinite word-hyperbolic fundamental group. Note that hyperbolic implies hyperbolike, equivalently non-hyperbolike implies non-hyperbolic. Furthermore if the well-known Geometrization Conjecture is true, hyperbolike and hyperbolic become equivalent.

The aim of this paper is to present the following result, which gives a new upper bound on the number of non-hyperbolike surgeries under the assumption that surgery slopes are integral. Remark that if a meridian-longitude system for K is fixed, then surgery slopes for K are parametrized by [formula] in a standard way. See [\cite=Rol] for example.

Let K be a hyperbolic knot in a closed orientable 3-manifold. Suppose that an arbitrarily chosen meridian-longitude system for K is fixed, and by using this, surgery slopes for K are parametrized by [formula]. If two 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgeries on K are both non-hyperbolike, and their surgery slopes are both integers, then the distance between the surgery slopes is at most eight. This implies that there are at most NINE integral non-hyperbolike surgeries for K.

In particular case of the figure-eight knot in S3, with the standard meridian-longitude system, the exceptional surgery slopes are - 4, - 3, - 2, - 1,0,1,2,3,4, and 1 / 0. The slopes - 4 and 4 have distance eight, and there are nine integral exceptional surgeries. Thus our bound is best possible.

It should be noted that Theorem [\ref=thm1] assures that if some knot admits only integral non-hyperbolike surgeries, then the knot have at most TEN non-hyperbolike surgeries, that is, nine integral ones and a trivial one.

For example, it is remarked in [\cite=Wu] that some class of arborescent knots admit only integral surgeries yielding reducible, toroidal or Seifert fibered 3-manifolds. Such 3-manifolds are sometimes called non-hyperbolike in the sense of Gordon, and are shown to be actually non-hyperbolike in the sense of Agol. Precisely we obtain:

An arborescent knot admits at most TEN surgeries yielding reducible, toroidal or Seifert fibered 3-manifolds, unless it is a Montesinos knot of type M(x,1 / p,1 / q) or its mirror image, where x∈{  -  1 / 2n, - 1  ±  1 / 2n, - 2  +  1 / 2n}, and p, q and n are positive integers.

Proof

We start with preparing definitions and notations.

As usual, we call an embedded circle in a 3-manifold a knot. A knot K is called hyperbolic if its complement CK admits a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume.

A slope is defined to be the isotopy class of an unoriented non-trivial simple closed curve on the torus. The distance between two slopes means the minimal geometric intersection number of their representatives.

The complement of an open tubular neighborhood of K is called the exterior EK of the knot. Given a knot, a new manifold is obtained by taking the exterior of the knot and attaching a solid torus back. This operation is called a Dehn surgery on the knot. When one perform a Dehn surgery on a knot, a meridian curve of the attached solid torus determines a slope on the peripheral torus ∂EK of the knot. This slope is called the surgery slope of the Dehn surgery. In the following, we will use K(r) to denote the 3-manifold obtained by Dehn surgery on K with surgery slope r.

From now on, we assume that K is a hyperbolic knot in a closed orientable 3-manifold. Since K is hyperbolic, the complement CK is regarded as a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with single cusp. The universal cover of CK is identified with the hyperbolic 3-space [formula]. Under the covering projection, an equivariant set of horospheres bounding disjoint horoballs in [formula] descends to a torus embedded in CK, which we call a horotorus. As demonstrated in [\cite=Th], on a horotorus T, a Euclidean structure is obtained by restricting the hyperbolic structure of CK. By using this structure, the length of a curve on T can be defined. Also T is naturally identified with the boundary ∂EK of the exterior EK of K, for the image of the horoballs under the covering projection is topologically T times half open interval. Thus, for a slope r on ∂EK, we can define the length of r with respect to T as the minimal length of the simple closed curves on T corresponding to those on ∂EK with slope r.

The following three results will be used in our proof. All notations as above will be still used.

The next proposition was shown by Agol [\cite=A] and Lackenby [\cite=L], independently.

With respect to some horotorus, if the length of a slope r on ∂EK is greater than 6, then the surgered manifold K(r) is irreducible and its fundamental group is infinite word-hyperbolic.

Now let us choose the maximal horotorus T, that is, the one bounding the maximal region with no overlapping interior. The next proposition holds for such T, which was given in [\cite=Ad2]. See also [\cite=Ad1] and [\cite=Ad3].

With respect to the maximal horotorus, every slope on ∂EK has the length at least [formula] if K is neither the figure-eight knot nor the knot 52 in the knot table [\cite=Rol].

The next one was obtained in [\cite=CM], which is the key to show that the figure eight knot complement has the minimal volume among orientable 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

For any hyperbolic knot in a closed orientable 3-manifold, the area of the maximal horotorus must be at least 3.35.

We first assume that K is the figure eight knot in S3. In this case, exceptional surgeries are completely understood, as noted before, the statement holds. Next, in the case that K is the knot 52 in S3, it is also shown in [\cite=BW] that the statement also holds.

Now, we consider a hyperbolic knot K in general neither the figure eight knot nor the knot 52. Let r1 and r2 be slopes having distance Δ such that they are both integers with respect to the fixed meridian-longitude system for K and the surgered manifolds K(r1), K(r2) are both non-hyperbolike.

Take the maximal horotorus T in the complement of K. Let μ be the closed geodesic on T corresponding to the fixed meridian on the boundary ∂EK of the exterior EK of K. Let γi be the closed geodesic on T corresponding to a simple closed curve with slope ri on ∂EK for i  =  1,2. Up to translations, we may assume that γ1, γ2 and μ have a common intersection point.

Consider a component [formula] of the preimage of T in the universal cover [formula] of the complement of K. Since T has a Euclidean structure, [formula] is identified with the Euclidean 2-plane [formula]. On [formula], the preimage of the common intersection point of γ1, γ2 and μ give a lattice. By fixing one of the points, say O, each primitive lattice point corresponds to a slope on T, and the distance between O and a primitive lattice point is equal to the length of the corresponding slope.

We take lattice points A and B such that the paths OA and OB are lifts of γ1 and γ2 respectively, and the path AB is projected to Δ times multiple of μ on T. Note that the latter condition can be achieved by integrality of r1 and r2. Also note that the area of the triangle OAB is just the half of Δ times that of T. The reason is that the parallelogram spanned by OA and OB wraps T under the covering projection Δ times.

Then we have;

the length [formula], [formula] of the paths OA, OB is at most 6 by Proposition [\ref=prop1],

the length [formula] of the path AB is at least [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop2],

the area Area(OAB) of the triangle OAB is greater than the half of 3.35Δ by Proposition [\ref=prop3].

Suppose for a contradiction that Δ  >  8. Let θ be the angle between OA and OB so that 0  <  θ  <  π. Then by

[formula]

the angle θ is greater than π / 2.

Now, by the Euclidean cosine law, we have

[formula]

and so,

[formula]

holds.

On the other hand, by the formula of the area of a Euclidean parallelogram, we have

[formula]

and so,

[formula]

Combining Equations [\eqref=eq1] and [\eqref=eq2], we have

[formula]

From this, we have

[formula]

However Δ must be an integer, and so we would have Δ  ≤  8. This implies a contradiction to the assumption that Δ  >  8.
