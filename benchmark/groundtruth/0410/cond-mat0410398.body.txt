Comment on "Dynamical role of anyonic excitation statistics in rapidly rotating Bose gases"

It has been claimed in a recent letter that attractive bose gases under rapid rotation can be stabilized in a fractional quantum Hall state due to the anyonic statistics of their quasiparticle excitations[\cite=fis]. Further, it is claimed that the solutions of the self-dual equation satisfying Bogomol'nyi bound with non-zero "external" field can be obtained exactly from that of Jackiw-Pi solutions through time-dependent coordinate transformations[\cite=fis]. We argue in this comment with the help of known results[\cite=pij1] [\cite=pij2] that the anyonic excitation statistics does not play any dynamical role in stabilizing the attractive bose gases. We also point out that the assertion of obtaining exact solutions of the self-dual equation (11) in Ref. [\cite=fis] with Ω  ≠  0 is invalid.

The dynamical stability of the system described by the Hamiltonian H in Ref. [\cite=fis] with quartic self-interaction has been studied previously[\cite=pij1]. Results obtained in subsequent papers[\cite=pij2] [\cite=pij3] are also equally valid for H due to an underlying universality. The mean-square radius [formula] has the same dynamical behaviour for the system with or without the Chern-Simons gauge field, if it is evolved with the same set of initial conditions and a fixed H  >  0 for both the cases[\cite=pij1] [\cite=pij2]. On the other hand, the field ψ blows up (i.e. I collapses) at a finite time independent of initial conditions if H  ≤  0[\cite=pij1] [\cite=pij2]. This result is again valid for both in presence and in absence of the Chern-Simons gauge field.

Analyzing Eq. (8) of Ref. [\cite=fis] with an attractive quartic self-interaction( i.e. U  =  g|ψ|4 with g  <  0), at the self-dual point geff = 0 and V(x) = 0, we find that H is negative for ΘΩ  >  0. The fractional quantum Hall state with the filling factor ν  <  1 is obtained in Ref. [\cite=fis] for both Θ and Ω positive, implying H  <  0. Hence, the system is not dynamically stable and the field ψ blows up at a finite time. In fact, there are no finite energy solutions of the self-dual Eqn. (11) for g  <  0 and ΘΩ  >  0, since the energy-functional is not bounded from below.

Our second point concerns about the claim of obtaining exact solutions of the self-dual equation (11) with Ω  ≠  0. Any solution of a self-dual equation saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound is necessarily a solution of the second order equations of motion that are obtained by varying the action. However, the converse is not true. There are solutions of the second order equations of motion with higher energy which are not solutions of the self-dual equation. The mapping that relates SΘ with Ω  ≠  0 to that SΘ with Ω = 0 is only at the level of action. Thus, an exact solution of the second order equations of motion of SΘ at geff = 0, can definitely be obtained from Jackiw-Pi soliton of SΘ with Ω = 0, which however is not a solution of the Eqn. (11). In fact, unlike these exact solutions, the density ρ  =  ψ*ψ of the self-dual system is not determined by the Liouville equation for Ω  ≠  0[\cite=ezawa].
