Lemma

On the integral kernels of derivatives of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup

Introduction

Much effort [\cite=Harboure2000] [\cite=Kemppainen2015] [\cite=Maas2010b] [\cite=MaasNeervenPortal2011] [\cite=MauceriMeda2007] [\cite=MauceriMeda2012] [\cite=Muckenhaupt] [\cite=Pineda2008] [\cite=Portal2014] [\cite=Sjogren1997] [\cite=Teuwen2015] has gone into developing the harmonic analysis of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator

[formula]

On the space [formula], where γ is the Gaussian measure

[formula]

this operator can be viewed as the Gaussian counterpart of the Laplace operator Δ. Indeed, one has [formula], where [formula] is the the usual gradient and the [formula] is its adjoint in [formula]. It is a classical fact that the semigroup operators etL, t > 0, are integral operators of the form where Mt is the so-called Mehler kernel [\cite=Sjogren1997]

[formula]

(see [\cite=Teuwen2015] for a representation of Mt which makes the symmetry in x and y explicit).

Developing a Hardy space theory for L is the subject of active current research [\cite=Portal2014] [\cite=MauceriMeda2007]. In this theory the derivatives (dk / dtk)etL  =  LNetL play an important role. The aim of the present paper is to derive closed form expressions for the integral kernels of these derivatives, that is, to determine explicitly the kernels MNt such that we have the identity

[formula]

Direct application of the derivatives dN / dtN to the Mehler kernel yields expressions which become intractible even for small values of N. Our approach will be to expand the Mehler kernel in terms of the L2-normalised Hermite polynomials and then to apply LN to it, thus exploiting the fact that the Hermite polynomials are eigenfunctions for L.

As an application of our main result, which is proved in section [\ref=sec:mainresult] after developing some preliminary material in the sections [\ref=sec:prelim]-[\ref=sec:Weyl], we shall give a direct proof for the kernel bounds of [\cite=Portal2014] in section [\ref=sec:application].

Preliminaries

In this preliminary section we collect some standard properties of Hermite polynomials and their relationship with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. Most of this material is classical and can be found in [\cite=Sjogren1997] [\cite=MR1215939].

Hermite polynomials

The Hermite polynomials Hn, n  ≥  0, are defined by Rodrigues's formula

[formula]

Their L2-normalisations,

[formula]

form an orthonormal basis for [formula]. We shall use the fact that the generating function for the Hermite polynomials is given by

[formula]

The relationship with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator is encoded in the eigenvalue identity LHn  =   - nHn, from which it follows that for all t  ≥  0 we have [formula]. From this one quickly deduces that the Mehler kernel is given by

[formula]

We will need two further identities for the Hermite polynomials which can be found, e.g., in [\cite=NIST:DLMF]: the integral representation

[formula]

and the "binomial" identity

[formula]

Hermite polynomials in several variables

The Hermite polynomials on [formula] are defined, for multiindices [formula] by the tensor extensions

[formula]

for [formula] in [formula]. The normalized Hermite polynomials

[formula]

form an orthonormal basis in [formula], and we have the eigenvalue identity

[formula]

If we consider the action of [formula] on a Hermite polynomial hα, through the multinomial theorem applied to |α|k we get (writing Ld for the operator L in dimension d and L1 for the operator L in dimension 1)

[formula]

This implies that we can reduce the question of computing the d-dimensional version of the integral kernel to the one-dimension one.

A combinatorial lemma

From now on we concentrate on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator L in one dimension, i.e., in [formula]. We are going to follow the approach of [\cite=Sjogren1997]. Recalling the identity Lhn  =   - nhn, we will apply LN to the generating function of the Hermite polynomials [\eqref=eq:Generating-function-identity]. A problem which immediately occurs is that Δ and [formula] do not commute, and because of this we cannot use a standard binomial formula to evaluate LN. Instead, we note that

[formula]

In particular this implies that

[formula]

where

[formula]

The following lemma will be very useful.

We have

[formula]

where [formula] are the Stirling numbers of the second kind.

The Stirling numbers of the second kind are quite well-known combinatorial objects. For the sake of completeness we will state their definition and recall some relevant properties below. For more information we refer the reader to [\cite=LINT]. The related Stirling numbers of the first kind will not be needed here.

We begin by recalling the definition of falling factorial

[formula]

for non-negative integers k  ≥  n.

For non-negative integers N  ≥  n, the number Stirling number of the second kind [formula] is defined as the number of partitions of an N-set into n non-empty subsets.

These numbers satisfy the recursion identity

[formula]

For all non-negative integers j and k one has the generating function identity

[formula]

Weyl Polynomials

Before turning to the proof of lemma [\ref=lem:Lk-powers-expanded], let us already mention that it only dependes on the commutator identity   =   - 1. This brings us to the observation that Weyl polynomials provide the natural habitat for our expressions. Rougly speaking, a Weyl polynomial is a polynomial in two non-commuting variables x and y which satisfy the commutator identity   =   - 1. This is made more precise in the following definition.

The Weyl algebra over a field [formula] of characteristic zero is the ring [formula] of all polynomials of the form [formula] with coefficients [formula] in two noncommuting variables x and y which satisfy the commutator identity

[formula]

We now have the following abstract version of lemma [\ref=lem:Lk-powers-expanded]:

In the Weyl algebra [formula] we have the identity

[formula]

where [formula] are the Stirling numbers of the second kind.

As a preparation for the proof of lemma [\ref=lem:Weyl-expansion] we make a couple of easy computations. If we set D: = xy, then

[formula]

This can be shown by induction on m. For instance, note that If we take this a bit further and have [formula], then

[formula]

The m-th powers, m  ≥  1, of x and y satisfy

[formula]

This can be seen using induction: and

The weighted degree of a monomial [formula] is the integer m - n. A polynomial in [formula] is said to be homogeneous of weighted degree j if all its constituting monomials have weighted degree j.

Left multiplication by xy is homogeneity preserving, i.e., for all [formula] it maps the set of homogeneous monomials of weighted degree j into itself. To prove this, first consider a monomial xmyn of dweighted egree j  =  m - n. Then, and we see that weighted degree of homogeneity is indeed preserved. The general case follows immediately. Through [\eqref=eq:Weyl-xmym] we conclude that left multiplication xkyk is homogeneity preserving as well, for all non-negative integers k. We claim that left multiplication by xiyj is homogeneity preserving only if i  =  j. To see this note that

[formula]

from which we can deduce that From which the claim follows.

Finally, a polynomial is homogeneity preserving if and only if all of its constituting monomials have this property. If this were not to be the case we could look at the highest-order non-homogeneous term and note from above xmyMxnyN would give terms of a lower order in the polynomial expansion which cannot cancel as they have different powers of x or y.

It follows from these observations that

[formula]

is precisely the set of homogeneity preserving polynomials in [formula].

Now everything is in place to give the proof of lemma [\ref=lem:Weyl-expansion].

As (xy)k is homogeneity preserving, we infer that there are coefficient aki in [formula] such that

[formula]

We will apply xj to the right on both sides of [\eqref=eq:Weyl-lemma-intermediate-step-wanted-form] and derive an expression for the aki. First note that [\eqref=eq:Weyl-poly-1] gives and [\eqref=eq:Weyl-xmym] together with [\eqref=eq:Weyl-poly-1] gives Hence, to find the coefficients aki it is sufficient to consider Comparing the constant terms on both the left-hand side and right-hand side, we find

[formula]

where (j)i is the falling factorial as in [\eqref=eq:falling-factorial]. Comparing [\eqref=eq:Weyl-result-generating-function] with the generating function of the Stirling numbers of the second kind [formula] as given in [\eqref=eq:Stirling-numbers-second-kind-generating-function-1], we see that [formula]. This concludes the proof of lemma [\ref=lem:Weyl-expansion].

The integral kernel of [formula]

As mentioned before, as a first step we would like to apply DN to the generating function [formula] for the Hermite polynomials [\eqref=eq:Generating-function-identity]. We first compute the action of ∂Nt on the generating function.

We have

[formula]

We first note that,

[formula]

Using this we get

[formula]

By a change of variables, Hence, by [\eqref=eq:Hermite-Rodrigues],

For all [formula] and t > 0 we have

[formula]

This is now easy to prove. Recalling that L  =   - t∂t and using [\eqref=eq:Expanded-Differentiatial-operator-generated], we get

[formula]

Our next theorem is the main result of this paper and provides an explicit expression for the integral kernel of LNetL.

Let L be the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator on [formula], let t > 0, and let N  ≥  0 be an integer. The integral kernel MNt of [formula] is given by

[formula]

We first prove the result for d  =  1. Pulling LN through the integral expression [\eqref=eq:Mehler] for etL involving the Mehler kernel, we must find a suitable expression for the kernel MNt(  ·  ,y)  =  LNMt(  ·  ,y). Using [\eqref=eq:Mehler_kernel_non_comp] and the normalization of Hm in [\eqref=eq:Hermite-normalized] we get

[formula]

The operator LN is applied with respect to x here, so by lemma [\ref=lem:power-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-generating-Hermite] we get

[formula]

where in last line we have used the analytic continuation of the algebraic identity [\eqref=eq:power-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-generating-Hermite]. Similarly we can expand [formula] using [\eqref=eq:Hermite-binomial-type]. This gives so that MNt can be written as

[formula]

If we set [formula], this reduces our task to computing the integral

[formula]

To make the computation less convolved, let us set This allows us to write the exponential in the integral [\eqref=eq:Hermite-integral-derivation-1] as This reduces the problem, after the substitution αtξ  →  ξ, to computing the integral The final integral is an integral expression for the Hermite polynomials [\eqref=eq:Hermite-integral], so

[formula]

Next we note that exp (y2  -  βt(x,y)2)α- 1t  =  Mt, the Mehler kernel from [\eqref=eq:Mehler]. Hence,

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=eq:reduction-to-d1] we get the result in d dimensions.

An application

As an application of our main result, in this section we give an alternative proof of the bounds on the kernels K and [formula] of [\cite=Portal2014] (see the definition below), making the dependence on the parameters more explicit. These kernels play a central role in the study of the Hardy space [formula] in [\cite=Portal2014], where the standard Calderón reproducing formula is replaced by

[formula]

where C is a suitable constant only depending on N and α (this can be seen by letting u be a Hermite polynomial). The kernels K and [formula] then occur in several decompositions, and the estimates below allow them to be related to classical results about the Mehler kernel.

We define the kernels K and [formula] by

[formula]

Note that the operators on the right-hand sides are indeed given by integral kernels: the first is a scaled version of the operator we have already been studying, and a duality argument implies that the second is given by the integral kernel

[formula]

Thus, both kernels are given as appropriate derivatives of the Mehler kernel.

We begin with a technical lemma which is a rephrased version of [\cite=Portal2014]. One should take note that we define the kernels with respect to the Gaussian measure whereas, [\cite=Portal2014] defines these with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

For all α  >  1 and all t > 0 and x,y in [formula] we have

[formula]

Additionally, we have

[formula]

Let N be a positive integer, 0  <  t  <  T. The for all large enough α > 1 we have

If t|x|  ≤  C, then

[formula]

If t|x|  ≤  C, then

[formula]

For Kt2,α,N, we use Theorem [\ref=th:integral-kernel] to obtain, after taking absolute values,

[formula]

Recalling that [formula], using the assumptions t  ≤  T and t|x|  ≤  C we can bound [formula] by considering the highest order term to obtain

[formula]

Using [\eqref=eq:Mehler-alpha-efficient3] we proceed by looking at

[formula]

We can now bound the final Hermite polynomial in the expression of the kernel. Setting [formula] we get

[formula]

Also,

[formula]

Putting these estimates together, using Lemma [\ref=lem:Mehler-alpha-efficient1], and taking α > 1 so large that

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

using t|x|  ≤  C in the last step.

For the bound on [formula] we consider

[formula]

So, as the first term on the right-hand side just decreases in degree we look at

[formula]

The last term is bounded as [formula], and the rest of the proof is as before.
