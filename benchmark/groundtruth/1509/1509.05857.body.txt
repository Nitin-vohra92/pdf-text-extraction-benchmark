Introduction

A graph is called here C4-free, if it does not contain cycles on four vertices as an induced subgraph. The class of C4-free graphs have been studied from many points of view, for example they appear in the theory of perfect graphs (as families containing chordal graphs). Sometimes the complements of C4-free graphs are investigated, they are the graphs that do not contain 2K2 as an induced subgraph, sometimes called a strong matching of size two. Extremal properties of these graphs emerged in works of Bermond, Bond, Pauli and Peck [\cite=BBP], [\cite=BBPP] on interconnection networks, popularized by Erd os and Nesetril, and generated extremal results, many on the strong chromatic index, for example [\cite=CGYTT] [\cite=FGYST] [\cite=GYHS] [\cite=MR] [\cite=PPTW].

In this paper we revisit [\cite=GYHS] where the the following problem (raised by Erd os) was investigated: how large is ω(G), the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in a dense C4-free graph G? It was proved in [\cite=GYHS] that in a C4-free graph with n vertices and at least cn2 edges, ω(G)  ≥  c'n, where c' depends on c only. The interest in this result is that as shown in [\cite=GYHS], C4 is the only graph with this property (apart from subgraphs of C4). Let f(c) denote the largest c' for which every C4-free graph with n vertices and at least cn2 edges contains a clique of size at least c'n. There is no conjecture on f(c), apart from the question in [\cite=GYHS] whether f(1 / 4) = 1 / 4 which is still open. Our main result, Theorem [\ref=reg] gives a positive answer to the the special case of this question for regular graphs (asked also in [\cite=GYHS]).

Every 2k-regular C4-free graph on 4k + 1 vertices contains a clique of size k + 1.

As shown in [\cite=GYHS], Theorem [\ref=reg] is sharp, the cycle on 4k + 1 vertices with all diagonals of length at most k is a 2k-regular C4-free graph where the largest clique is of size k + 1. The proof of Theorem [\ref=reg] follows from understanding the work of Paoli, Peck, Trotter and West [\cite=PPTW] on regular 2K2-free graphs.

Our other results are improvements over the estimates of [\cite=GYHS] under the stronger assumption that the minimum degree δ(G) is given instead of the average degree.

For C4-free graphs [formula].

Theorem [\ref=gen] improves the estimate [formula] in [\cite=GYHS] where a is the average degree of G. For a certain range of δ(G), one can do better.

Suppose that G is a C4-free graph with [formula] Then [formula].

Note that for δ(G)  ≥  n / 2, Theorem [\ref=gen] gives ω(G)  ≥  n / 12 while Theorem [\ref=spec] gives ω(G)  ≥  n / 6. It seems that the remark "the best estimate we know is n / 6" in [\cite=GYHS] comes from this and it seems an open problem whether ω(G)  ≥  n / 6 follows from |E(G)|  ≥  n2 / 4. We also note that for [formula] the bound of Theorem [\ref=spec] is better than that of Theorem [\ref=gen].

Our last estimate of ω(G) is for the case when G has a large independent set.

For every ε  >  0 the following holds. Let G be a C4-free graph on n vertices with minimum degree at least δ. Furthermore, let us assume that G contains an independent set of size [formula]. Then G contains a clique of size at least (1 - ε)δ2 / n.

Thus we get the following corollary for Dirac graphs (graphs with minimum degree at least n / 2).

For every ε  >  0 the following holds. Let G be a C4-free graph on n vertices with minimum degree at least n / 2. Furthermore, let us assume that G contains an independent set of size [formula]. Then G contains a clique of size at least (1 - ε)n / 4.

Corollary [\ref=alpha5] probably holds in a stronger form: C4-free graphs with n vertices and with minimum degree at least n / 2 contain cliques of size at least n / 4.

Properties of C4-free graphs

The following easy lemma can be essentially found in [\cite=CGYTT] [\cite=FGYST] [\cite=PPTW] but we prove it to be self contained. Let W5 denote the 5-wheel, the graph obtained from a five-cycle by adding a new vertex adjacent to all vertices. A clique substitution into a graph G is the replacement of cliques into vertices of G so that between substituted vertices all or none of the edges are placed, depending whether they were adjacent or not in G. Substituting an empty clique is accepted as a deletion of the vertex. Clique substitutions into C4-free graphs result in C4-free graphs.

Suppose that G is a C4-free graph with α(G)  ≤  2. Then one of the following possibilities holds.

the complement of G is bipartite

G can be obtained from W5 by clique substitution

Proof. If [formula], the complement of G is not bipartite then we can find an odd cycle C in [formula]. Since C cannot be a triangle, |C|  ≥  5. However, |C|  ≥  7 is impossible since G is C4-free. Thus |C| = 5. Since G is C4-free and α(G) = 2, any vertex not on C must be adjacent to exactly three consecutive vertices of C or to all vertices of C. This procedure naturally allows to place all vertices not on C into one of six groups and one can easily check that the groups must be cliques forming the claimed structure.  [formula]

Suppose that G is a C4-free graph with α(G)  ≤  2. Then [formula].

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=reg] we shall use the following result which is a special case of a more general result on regular C4-free graphs (in [\cite=PPTW] Theorem 4 and Lemma 7). A set S  ⊂  V(G) is dominating if every vertex of [formula] is adjacent to some vertex of S.

(Paoli, Peck, Trotter, West [\cite=PPTW], (1992)) Suppose that G is a 2k-regular C4-free graph on 4k + 1 vertices with α(G)  ≥  3. Then G contains a pair (u,w) of non-adjacent vertices forming a dominating set.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=reg]. The proof comes from Theorem [\ref=domin] and the analysis of Theorem 3 in [\cite=PPTW]. We may suppose that α(G)  ≥  3, otherwise Corollary [\ref=coralpha2] gives a clique of size [formula]. Theorem [\ref=domin] ensures a dominating non-adjacent pair (u,w) in G. Let X be the set of common neighbors of u,v. Then

[formula]

implying that |X| = 1. Set X = {x}, U = N(u) - {x}, W = N(w) - {x}, [formula], [formula], U2 = U - U1, W2 = W - W1.

Claim. U1,W1 span cliques in G.

Proof of Claim. By symmetry, it is enough to prove the claim for U1. Note that for w2∈W2,u1∈U1 we have (w2,u1)∉E(G) otherwise (w2,u1,x,w,w2) would be an induced C4.

Suppose that y,z∈U1 and (y,z)∉E(G). Let N be the number of non-adjacent pairs (p,q) such that p∈{y,z},q∉U1.

every w1∈W1 contributes at least one to N, otherwise (w1,y,u,z,w1) is a C4

every u2∈U2 contributes at least one to N, otherwise (u2,y,x,z,u2) is a C4

every w2∈W2 contributes two to N since (w2,u1)∉E(G) for every u1∈U1

w contributes two to N

Therefore we have

[formula]

However, since (y,z)∉E(G), [formula], a contradiction, proving that U1 spans a clique in G and the claim is proved.  [formula]

Now the two cliques [formula] and [formula] cover [formula]. Since |A| = 4k + 1 - 2k = 2k + 1 and the two cliques intersect in {x}, one of the cliques has size at least k + 1, finishing the proof.  [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=gen]. Here we follow the proof of the corresponding theorem in [\cite=GYHS] with replacing average degree by minimum degree. Fix an independent set [formula]. Let Ai be the set of neighbors of xi in G and set [formula]. Since G is C4-free, all the subgraphs [formula] are complete graphs, and thus m  ≤  ω(G). Using that |Ai|  ≥  δ, we get

[formula]

implying that

[formula]

If [formula] then set [formula] and we get

[formula]

If [formula] then of course [formula] as well. Now we shall use the following claim: [formula]. This follows by selecting an independent set S with |S| = α(G) = α. Using the notation introduced above, the [formula] sets [formula] and the α sets [formula] cover the vertex set of G where Bi denotes the set of vertices whose only neighbor in S is xi. All of these sets span complete subgraphs because G is C4-free and S is maximal. Now we have

[formula]

Therefore in both cases we have

[formula]

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=spec]. If α(G)  ≤  2 then by Lemma [\ref=alpha2] and by the upper bound on δ(G),

[formula]

If α(G)  ≥  3, then select an independent set {v1,v2,v3} and let Ai denote the set of neighbors of xi. Then

[formula]

implying that for some 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  3, the clique induced by [formula] is larger than [formula].  [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=largealpha]. Let [formula] be an independent set in G of size [formula]. Let Ai be the set of neighbors of xi in G. Note that being induced C4-free implies that for every [formula] the set [formula] induces a clique in G. Thus if we show that there are [formula] such that [formula], then we are done. Assume indirectly, that for every [formula] we have [formula] and from this we will get a contradiction.

Consider an auxiliary bipartite graph Gb between the sets S and V = V(G), where we connect each xi with its neighbors in G. We will give both a lower and an upper bound for the quantity [formula]. To get a lower bound we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the minimum degree condition:

[formula]

To get the upper bound we use the indirect assumption:

[formula]

[formula]

(using [formula]), a contradiction.  [formula]
