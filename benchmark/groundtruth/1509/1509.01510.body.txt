Adjoints of linear fractional composition operators on weighted Hardy spaces

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the open unit disk in the complex plane. Let [formula] be an analytic map. The composition operator Cφ is defined by [formula], where f is an analytic function on [formula]. Composition operators have been studied extensively on Hilbert spaces of analytic functions such as the Hardy space H2, the weighted Bergman spaces A2α (α >  - 1) and the Dirichlet space D, just to name few. The reader is referred to the excellent books [\cite=CowenCRCP1995] and [\cite=Shapiro1993] for more details. Of particular interest was finding the formula for the adjoint C*φ on these spaces. Cowen [\cite=CowenIEOT1988] found the formula for C*φ on H2 for the case φ is a linear fractional self-map of [formula] (we shall call such Cφ a linear fractional composition operator). Cowen showed that if φ(z)  =  (az + b) / (cz + d) is a linear fractional mapping of [formula] into itself then

[formula]

where σ(z) = (āz - ) / ( - z + ) is the Kren adjoint of φ and Mg and Mh are multiplication operators with symbols g(z) = ( - z + )- 1 and h(z) = cz + d. Cowen's formula was later extended by Hurst [\cite=HurstArchivM1997] to weighted Bergman spaces A2α with α >  - 1. Such formulas initiated more studies of the adjoint of linear fractional composition operators on different spaces of analytic functions and on H2 for general rational symbols. See [\cite=Gallardo-GutierrezMAnn2003] [\cite=CowenJFA2006] [\cite=MartinJFA2006] [\cite=HammondJMAA2008] [\cite=BourdonJFA2008] and the references therein.

Recently, Heller [\cite=HellerJMAA2012] investigated the adjoint of Cφ acting on the space [formula], which consists of analytic functions on [formula] whose first derivative belongs to H2. Let K denote the ideal of compact operators on [formula]. Heller obtained the following results.

For a general linear fractional self-map φ, a formula for C*φ modulo the compact operators can be obtained by combining the above two results. Certain simplification of the above formulas was also presented in [\cite=HellerJMAA2012]. It is curious to us that Heller's formulas are not of the same form as Cowen's formula [\eqref=Eqn:CowenFormula]: the order of the multiplication operators is different. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the adjoints of linear fractional composition operators in a more general setting. We then explain how to recover Heller's formulas from our results.

All of the spaces mentioned above belong to the class of weighted Hardy spaces H2(β), where β  =  {β(n)}∞n  ≥  1 is a sequence of positive numbers. These spaces are Hilbert spaces of analytic functions on the unit disk in which the monomials {zn:n  ≥  0} form an orthogonal basis with [formula]. We shall show that it is possible to obtain Cowen's formula modulo compact operators not only on [formula] but also on a wide subclass of weighted Hardy spaces H2(β). Our strategy involves the family of weighted Bergman spaces A2α ([formula]) studied by Zhao and Zhu [\cite=ZhaoMSMF2008]. We use the exact formulas for the reproducing kernels of A2α to obtain Cowen's type formula for C*φ on these spaces first. We then extend our formulas to H2(β) for appropriate weight sequences whose term βn behaves asymptotically as [formula].

Adjoint formulas on A2α

In this section we study the adjoint of composition operators acting on weighted Bergman spaces A2α for [formula]. The standard weighted Bergman spaces are defined for measures dAα(z)  =  (1 - |z|2)αdA(z) with α >  - 1. Zhao and Zhu [\cite=ZhaoMSMF2008] extended this definition to the case where α is any real number. For any [formula], the space A2α consists of holomorphic functions f on [formula] with the property that there exists an integer k  ≥  0 with α + 2k >  - 1 such that (1 - |z|2)kf(k)(z) belongs to [formula], or equivalently, f(k) belongs to A2α + 2k. It is well know that this definition is consistent with the traditional definition for α >  - 1. The reader is referred to [\cite=ZhaoMSMF2008] for a detailed study of A2α. Note that any function that is analytic on an open neighborhood of the closed unit disk belongs to A2α for all α.

In [\cite=ZhaoMSMF2008], it was shown that each A2α is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. When equipped with an appropriate inner product, the kernel of A2α can be computed explicitly. Depending on the value of α, we obtain three types of kernels. For each type, we show that the operator

[formula]

is either zero or has finite rank, where g and h are certain analytic functions associated with φ.

For α + 2 > 0, the kernel is

[formula]

and

[formula]

which behaves asymptotically as m- (α + 1) / 2 by Stirling's formula.

When α + 2 is negative and non-integer such that - N < α + 2 <  - N + 1 for some positive integer N, the kernel takes the form

[formula]

where Q is an analytic polynomial of degree N. In this case, for m > N,

[formula]

which also behaves asymptotically as m- (α + 1) / 2.

In the case α + 2  =   - N, where N is a non-negative integer, the kernel has the form

[formula]

where Q is an analytic polynomial of degree N. For m > N, we have

[formula]

where Am is the coefficient of zm in the Taylor expansion

[formula]

The argument in the paragraph preceding [\cite=ZhaoMSMF2008] shows that [formula] behaves asymptotically as m(N + 1) / 2  =  m- (α + 1) / 2 as well.

For any real number α, we see that [formula] behaves asymptotically as m- (α + 1) / 2 when m  →    ∞  .

For the Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces (which may be identified as A2α with α  ≥   - 1), it is well known that their multiplier spaces are exactly the same as [formula] and any composition operator induced by a holomorphic self-map of [formula] is bounded. However, such results do not hold for other values of α. On the other hand, it turns out, as we shall show below, that all multiplication and composition operators discussed in this paper are bounded on all A2α.

For two positive quantities A and B, we write [formula] if there exists a constant c > 0 independent of the variables under consideration such that A  ≤  cB. We write A  ≈  B if [formula] and [formula].

Let m  ≥  0 be an integer. Recall [\cite=ZhaoMSMF2008] that for any real number α, a function f belongs to A2α if and only if the mth derivative f(m) belongs to A2α + 2m and

[formula]

Also, if α1  <  α2 then

[formula]

Let α be a real number and m be a positive integer such that α + 2m >  - 1. There exists a positive constant C such that if u is a function holomorphic on an open neighborhood of the closed unit disk, then Mu is a bounded operator on A2α and

[formula]

To simplify the notation, we put

[formula]

For any f∈A2α, using [\eqref=Eqn:equivNorm], we compute

[formula]

Moreover, for any 0  ≤  j  ≤  m, by [\eqref=Eqn:equivNorm] and [\eqref=Eqn:inequalNorm], we have

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

This implies [\eqref=Eqn:multipliers_A2_alpha] with a constant C independent of u.

Let φ be a holomorphic self-map of [formula] such that φ extends to a holomorphic function on an open neighborhood of the closed unit disk. Then Cφ is a bounded operator on A2α for any real number α.

Fix any real number γ >  - 1. We shall prove that Cφ is bounded on A2- 2k + γ for all integers k  ≥  0 by induction on k. This immediately yields the conclusion of the lemma.

Since γ >  - 1, A2γ is the weighted Bergman space with weight (1 - |z|2)γ. It is well known that Cφ is bounded on A2γ, which proves our claim for the case k = 0. Now assume that Cφ is bounded on A2- 2k + γ for some integer k  ≥  0. We would like to show that Cφ is bounded on A2- 2k - 2 + γ. Since Cφ is a closed operator, it suffices to show that for any h in A2- 2k - 2 + γ, the composition [formula] belongs to A2- 2k - 2 + γ as well. This, in turn, is equivalent to the requirement that [formula] belongs to A2- 2k + γ. We have [formula]. Since h is in A2- 2k - 2 + γ, the derivative h' belongs to A2- 2k + γ. By the induction hypothesis, [formula] belongs to A2- 2k + γ as well. On the other hand, by our assumption about φ, Lemma [\ref=L:multipliers_A2_alpha] shows that multiplication by φ' is a bounded operator on A2- 2k + γ. Consequently, [formula] is an element of A2- 2k + γ, which is what we wish to show.

As in Heller's work, our adjoint formula for Cφ holds modulo finite rank or compact operators. We first recall a description of finite rank operators on Hilbert spaces, see, for example, [\cite=ConwaySpringer1990].

Let H be a Hilbert space. For non-zero vectors u,v∈H, we use [formula] to denote the rank one operator [formula] for h∈H.

A bounded linear operator A:H  →  H has rank at most m if and only if there exist [formula] and [formula] belonging to H such that

[formula]

When H is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic function, Lemma [\ref=L:finiteRankHilbert] takes a different form which will be useful for us. This result is probably well known but we provide a proof for the reason of completeness.

Let H be a Hilbert space of analytic functions on the unit disk with reproducing kernel K. Let X be the set of functions on [formula] of the form

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] belong to H and m is a positive integer. Then a bounded linear operator A:H  →  H has finite rank if and only if the function (z,w)  ↦  〈AKw,Kz〉 belongs to X. Here Kw(z)  =  K(z,w) for [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=L:finiteRankHilbert], a bounded linear operator A:H  →  H has finite rank if and only if there exist a positive integer m and functions [formula] and [formula] belonging to H such that

[formula]

For 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  m, we have

[formula]

The conclusion of the lemma now follows from the density of the linear span of [formula].

Suppose φ(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d) is a linear fractional self-map of the unit disk. Let σ(z) = (āz - ) / ( - z + ) be the Kren adjoint of φ. It is known that σ is also a self-map of [formula]. Let η(z) = (cz + d)- 1 and μ(z) =  - z + . Then η and μ are bounded analytic functions on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and

[formula]

Consequently, by choosing appropriate branches of the logarithms, we have

[formula]

Therefore, for any real number γ,

[formula]

for z,w in [formula].

We are now in a position to discuss the adjoints of composition operators induced by linear fractional maps. In the following theorem, we consider the first two types of kernels.

Let α be a real number such that α + 2 is not zero nor a negative integer. Let φ(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d) be a linear fractional self-map of the unit disk and σ be its Kren adjoint. Let g(z)  =  ( - z + )-  α - 2 and h(z) = (cz + d)α + 2 for [formula]. Then C*φ - MgCσM*h has finite rank on A2α. In the case α + 2 > 0, we actually have the identity C*φ  =  MgCσM*h.

Lemmas [\ref=L:multipliers_A2_alpha] and [\ref=L:boundedCOs] show that the operators Cφ, Cσ, Mg and Mh are all bounded on A2α.

As we mentioned before, the case α >  - 1 was considered by Hurst [\cite=HurstArchivM1997]. His proof works also for - 2 < α  ≤   - 1 since the kernels have the same form. Here we only need to investigate the case - N  <  α + 2  <   - N + 1 for some positive integer N. To simplify the notation, let γ =  - (α + 2). We then rewrite the kernel as K(z,w)  =  ( - 1)N(1 - z)γ + Q(z) for [formula]. Set Kw(z)  =  K(z,w) for [formula]. We shall make use of the following identities, which are well known,

[formula]

We now compute

[formula]

Since g and h are analytic on a neighborhood of the closed unit disk and Q is a polynomial, the last function has the form [\eqref=Eqn:quasi_Functions]. Consequently, Lemma [\ref=L:finiteRankOperators] shows that C*φ  -  MgCσM*h has finite rank.

The following theorem considers the third type of kernel.

Let α be a real number such that α + 2 is zero or a negative integer. Let φ(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d) be a linear fractional self-map of the unit disk and σ be its Kren adjoint. Let g(z)  =  ( - z + )-  α - 2 and h(z) = (cz + d)α + 2 for [formula]. Then C*φ - MgCσM*h has finite rank on A2α.

Let N =  - α - 2. Then N is a nonnegative integer. Recall that the kernel in this case has the form

[formula]

for [formula], where Q is an analytic polynomial. We compute

[formula]

Since [formula], using [\eqref=Eqn:log], we simplify the first two terms in the last expression as

[formula]

where η(z) = (cz + d)- 1 and μ(z) =  - z +  for [formula]. Consequently,

[formula]

Since N is a nonnegative integer and Q is a polynomial, the expression on the right hand side is an element of the form [\eqref=Eqn:quasi_Functions]. Lemma [\ref=L:finiteRankOperators] shows that C*φ  -  MgCσM*h has finite rank.

Adjoint formulas on H2(β)

In this section we would like to generalize the results in Section 2 to certain weighted Hardy spaces H2(β). We begin with an auxiliary result. For s = 1,2, consider a Hilbert space Hs of analytic functions on the unit disk such that

[formula]

Here, {βs(n)}∞n = 0 is a sequence of positive real numbers with lim inf n  →    ∞βs(n)1 / n  =  1. Such restriction guarantees that elements of Hs are analytic function on the unit disk, see for example, [\cite=CowenCRCP1995]. Assume that

[formula]

It is clear that the norms on H1 and H2 are equivalent. We claim that there is a compact operator K:H2  →  H2 such that for all functions f,g∈H1,

[formula]

In fact, define the operator K:H2  →  H2 by

[formula]

for [formula] and extend by linearity and continuity to all H2. We see that K is a self-adjoint diagonal operator with respect to the orthonormal basis of monomials. By [\eqref=Eqn:equivWeights], [\cite=ConwaySpringer1990] shows that K is a compact operator on H2, hence on H1 as well. It is clear that [\eqref=Eqn:cptPerturbation] holds for f(z) = zj and [formula] if [formula]. If [formula], then we compute

[formula]

Linearity and boundedness of K then shows that [\eqref=Eqn:cptPerturbation] holds for all f,g∈H1.

Let A be a bounded linear operator on H1 (hence, A is also bounded on H2). Let Bs be the adjoint of A on Hs for s = 1,2. Then B2 - B1 is a compact operator on H2 (hence, on H1 as well).

For f,g∈H2, we have

[formula]

This implies B2(I + K) = (I + K)B1, which shows that B2 - B1  =  KB1 - B2K. Since K is compact on H2, we conclude that B2 - B1 is compact as well.

We now state and prove our main result in this section.

Let t be a real number. Suppose β  =  {β(n)}∞n = 0 is a sequence of positive numbers such that

[formula]

where [formula]. Let φ(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d) be a linear fractional self-map of the unit disk and σ be its Kren adjoint. Let g(z) = ( - z + )2t - 1 and h(z) = (cz + d)- 2t + 1. Then the difference C*φ  -  MgCσM*h is a compact operator on H2(β).

Let α =  - 2t - 1. Then t =  - (α + 1) / 2 and we have

[formula]

The last limit is a finite positive number by Remark [\ref=R:asymptoticBehavior]. This, in particular, says that the spaces A2α and H2(β) are the same with equivalent norms. For any bounded operator T on these spaces, we write T* ,α for the adjoint of T as an operator on A2α and T* ,β for the adjoint of T as an operator on H2(β).

By Theorems [\ref=T:AdjointFormula_a] and [\ref=T:AdjointFormula_b], the difference K = C* ,αφ  -  MgCσM* ,αh is compact on A2α, hence on H2(β) as well.

On the other hand, applying Proposition [\ref=P:compactDifference] with H1 = A2α and H2 = H2(β), we have C* ,βφ  =  C* ,αφ + K1 and M* ,βh  =  M* ,αh + K2 for some compact operators K1,K2 on H2(β). Consequently,

[formula]

which is compact on H2(β). This completes the proof of the theorem.

We now explain how one obtains Heller's results from our Theorem [\ref=T:mainTheorem]. Let φ be a holomorphic self-map of the unit disk. We shall consider two particular cases: the case φ(0) = 0 and the case φ is an automorphism.

Let β  =  {β(n)}∞n = 0 be a sequence of positive numbers satisfying the condition [\eqref=Eqn:condition_main_Theorem]. Let φ(z) = az / (cz + d) be a holomorphic self-map of the disk and consider Cφ acting on H2(β). Then we have

[formula]

where [formula] and σ(z) = (ā  /  )z -   /   is the Kren adjoint of φ.

Theorem [\ref=T:mainTheorem] shows that

[formula]

where g(z) = ()2t - 1,  h(z) = (cz + d)- 2t + 1. Since g is a constant function, we may combine it with h and rewrite [\eqref=Eqn:adjointCOs] as [formula], where [formula]. It then follows that [formula]. Now, a direct calculation verifies that [formula]. We then compute

[formula]

Multiplying by M*G on the left gives [formula] as desired.

Let β  =  {β(n)}∞n = 0 be a sequence of positive numbers satisfying the condition [\eqref=Eqn:condition_main_Theorem]. Let φ(z) = λ(z + u) / (1 + ūz), |λ| = 1, |u| < 1, be an automorphism of the disk and consider Cφ acting on H2(β). Then

[formula]

where [formula] and H(z) = (ūz + 1)2t - 1.

It can be verified that σ  =  φ- 1. Theorem [\ref=T:mainTheorem] gives

[formula]

where [formula] and h(z) = (ūz + 1)- 2t + 1. Taking adjoints gives

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Taking inverses then yields

[formula]

Since g = G and h = 1 / H, the conclusion of the corollary follows.

The space [formula] can be identified as H2(β), where the weight sequence β  =  {β(n)}n  ≥  0 is given by β(0) = 1 and β(n) = n for all n  ≥  1. This sequence satisfies condition [\eqref=Eqn:condition_main_Theorem] with t = 1. Consequently, Theorem A follows from Corollary [\ref=C:improved_TheoremA] and Theorem B follows from Corollary [\ref=C:improved_TheoremB].
