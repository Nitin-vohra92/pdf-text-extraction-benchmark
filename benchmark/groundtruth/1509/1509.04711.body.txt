Interpretations of quantum theory: A map of madness

As Mermin points out, "quantum theory is the most useful and powerful theory physicists have ever devised. Yet today, nearly 90 years after its formulation, disagreement about the meaning of the theory is stronger than ever. New interpretations appear every day. None ever disappear" [\cite=Mermin12]. This situation is odd and is arguably an obstacle for scientific progress, or at least for a certain kind of scientific progress. The periodic efforts of listing and comparing the increasing number of interpretations [\cite=Belinfante73] [\cite=Jammer74] [\cite=Bub97] [\cite=Dickson98] show that there is something persistent since the formulation of quantum theory: Interpretations are essentially of two types; those that view quantum probabilities of measurement outcomes as determined by intrinsic properties of the world and those that do not. Here we call them "type-I" and "type-II", respectively. In Table [\ref=Table1] some interpretations are classified according to this criterion and some extra details are given.

Two observations can be made in the light of Table [\ref=Table1].

This Table and these observations should be taken as motivations for further work. The fact that they may be controversial by themselves, and the interest showed by many colleagues, justify presenting them separately from any of these works.
