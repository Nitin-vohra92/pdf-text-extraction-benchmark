Factorization of a Matrix Differential Operator Using Functions in its Kernel

Motivation

An ordinary differential operator (ODO) is a commonly used mathematical object that turns one function into another by adding up the products of some other specified functions with its derivatives. Symbolically, an ODO is a polynomial in "∂" having coefficients that are functions of x. The highest power of ∂ appearing with a non-zero coefficient is called the order of the operator. ODOs act on functions of x according to the rule:

[formula]

Much interest in differential operators comes from their use in writing linear differential equations. However, ODOs also have the algebraic structure of a . They can be added as one would add any polynomials, by combining the coefficients of similar powers of ∂, and multiplication is defined by extending the following rule for the product of two monomials linearly over sums:

[formula]

Although this definition may look complicated at first, in fact it is simply a consequence of the usual "product rule" from calculus, applied here to guarantee that multiplication corresponds to operator composition as one would expect. That is, this definition was chosen so that [formula].

Given the rule [\eqref=eqn:ODOmult] for multiplication, the inverse question of factorization naturally arises. One factorization method for ODOs is surprisingly reminiscent of a familiar fact about polynomials. If x = λ is a root of the polynomial p(x), then you know that it has a factor of x - λ, the simplest first degree polynomial with this property. Similarly, for any non-zero function f(x), ∂ - f' / f is the simplest first order differential operator having f in its kernel, and if L is any ODO with f in its kernel then [formula] for some differential operator Q. Moreover, just as knowing additional roots of the polynomial p would allow further factorization, one may factor a differential operator of order n into the product of operators n - k and k from the knowledge of k linearly independent functions in its kernel. The general statement written in terms of Wronskian determinants is as follows:

Let [formula] be functions such that [formula]. Then (a) the unique monic differential operator K of order m satisfying K(φi) = 0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m is the one whose action on an arbitrary function f(x) is given by the formula [formula] and (b) if L is any differential operator satisfying L(φi) = 0 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m then there exists a differential operator Q such that [formula].

The Matrix Case

The purpose of this note is to generalize this well-known and useful result to the case of matrix coefficients. A matrix coefficient ordinary differential operator (MODO) is again a polynomial in ∂ with coefficients that depend on x, but we now consider the case in which those coefficients are N  ×  N matrices. The formulas for multiplying MODOs and for applying them to functions remain the same (see [\eqref=eqn:ODOapply] and [\eqref=eqn:ODOmult]), but now the products involving the coefficients are understood to be matrix products and the function f is an N-vector valued function.

Matrix analogues of Theorem [\ref=thm:scalar](a) already appear in the literature. For example, a result of Etingof-Gelfand-Retakh [\cite=QD] allows one to produce a monic MODO with a specified kernel using quasi-determinants. However, not only is there no published analogue of Theorem [\ref=thm:scalar](b) for MODOs, it appears that many researchers have suspected that it does not generalize nicely to the matrix case. A common proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:scalar](b) depends on the fact that any non-zero ODO of order at most n has a kernel of dimension at most n. So, the fact that any MODO with a singular leading coefficient has an infinite-dimensional kernel is both an obstacle to generalizing the proof and reason to doubt the validity of the equivalent statement for MODOs.

It is therefore good news that Theorem [\ref=thm:modo](b) below does indeed fully generalize the scalar result to the matrix case without imposing any additional restrictions on the leading coefficient, order or kernel of the operator L. In addition to proving this new result, what follows can be seen as providing a novel alternative proof to Theorem [\ref=thm:scalar] and Theorem [\ref=thm:modo](a).

Let [formula] be N-vector valued functions and let Φ be the MN  ×  MN block Wronskian matrix

[formula]

Note that the first N rows of Φ are given by the selected vector functions and then every other element is the derivative of the element N rows above it. In the case N = 1, the non-singularity of this matrix is famously equivalent to the linear independence of the functions, but that is not true in general. For instance, if N = 2, M = 1, [formula] and [formula], then det (Φ) = 0 even though these are linearly independent functions of x.

For the sake of brevity, the following notations will be utilized below. The symbol [formula] will denote the N  ×  MN matrix [formula] and [formula] will be used as a shorthand for the statement that D(φi) is equal to the zero vector for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  MN (i.e. that the vector functions are in the kernel of some linear operator D). The N  ×  N identity matrix will be written simply as I and more generally the m  ×  m identity matrix for any natural number m will be denoted by Im.

The main result can now be stated concisely as:

If the functions φi are chosen so that [formula] then (a) the differential operator

[formula]

is the unique monic MODO K of order M such that [formula] and (b) if L is any MODO such that [formula] then there exists a MODO Q such that [formula].

For a natural number m  ≥  M, let [formula] denote the (mN + N)  ×  (MN + N) matrix with block decomposition

[formula]

It is a nearly trivial observation that for a MODO L of order at most m one has

[formula]

That is, for any choice of L the product of the N  ×  (mN + N) matrix [formula] made from its coefficients with [formula] has the vector L(φi) as its ith column for 1  ≤  i  ≤  MN and the last N  ×  N block is a copy of the operator itself, and conversely for any choice of N  ×  (mN + N) matrix [formula] its product with [formula] yields a matrix that records a differential operator L and its action on each of the vector functions as in [\eqref=eqn:alpha].

In the case that m = M and the N  ×  N blocks αi are defined by

[formula]

the product [formula] in [\eqref=eqn:alpha] would equal

[formula]

for some MODO K. Because the MODOs in the block B are of degree at most M - 1, K is monic of degree M. We know that [formula] since the first MN columns, which are all zero, record its action on the functions φi. This operator K can equivalently be produced with the formula [\eqref=eqn:QD], as the quasi-determinant [formula] where ΦM is viewed as an (M + 1)  ×  (M + 1) matrix with entries that are N  ×  N matrices or as the Schur complement of the invertible block Φ in the matrix [formula]. This demonstrates the existence of the operator K promised in (a). (This could also have been achieved in many other ways, including merely by direct computation of K(φi), but doing it this way sets us up nicely for proving the rest of the claim.)

Let G be the (mN + N)  ×  (mN + N) matrix whose decomposition into N  ×  (mN + N) blocks

[formula]

and for i  ≥  M the block row [formula] where the functions gij are defined by the equation [formula]. Consider the product [formula]. Its first MN rows would have the form (IMN B) since Φ- 1Φ = IMN. For i  ≥  M, the product of block row Gi with [formula] is designed so that the MODO [formula] shows up as its last N  ×  N block. According to [\eqref=eqn:alpha], the previous columns would be the image of [formula] under the action of that operator, but [formula] so

[formula]

Now, suppose L is any MODO of order at most m satisfying [formula]. Label its coefficients as in [\eqref=eqn:alpha] and consider the product of the N  ×  (mN + N) matrix [formula] and the matrix [formula]. On the one hand, because the G- 1 and G cancel, [formula] is equal to the expression on the right in [\eqref=eqn:alpha]. Specifically, given the assumption [formula] it has the form [formula].

On the other hand, defining the N  ×  N functions qi by the block decomposition [formula] and making use of the block form of [formula] in [\eqref=eqn:GPhim] it is clear that [formula] is also equal to [formula], because the block IMN picks out and preserves the precisely the first M coefficient blocks.

Combining these two observations, we conclude that qi = 0 for 0  ≤  i  ≤  M - 1. Considering only the last block column in the product [formula], one obtains an expression for L as a sum involving the functions qi as coefficients multplied by the operators in the last block column of [formula], but given the fact that the first M of those coefficients are zero this simplifies to:

[formula]

Then the operator in parentheses above is the operator Q satisfying the claim in (b).

Finally, suppose [formula] was also a monic MODOs of order M such that [formula]. Then D = K -  is an operator of order strictly less than M with this same property. The only way that D can have order less than M and also satisfy [formula] for some MODO Q is if Q = D = 0, which demonstrates the uniqueness of K and completes the proof.

Example

Consider the case M = N = 2 and the vector functions

[formula]

Then the block Wronskian matrix in [\eqref=eqn:blockWr] is the matrix

[formula]

whose invertibility assures us that there is a unique monic MODO of order 2 having all four of these vectors in its kernel. Using [\eqref=eqn:QD] we can easily determine that this operator is

[formula]

Another MODO that obviously also has each φi in its kernel is

[formula]

Especially since the leading coefficient of L is non-zero and singular, a situation that cannot arise in the case N = 1, without the theorem above it would not be clear that there is an algebraic relationship between L and K. However, Theorem [\ref=thm:modo] assures us that any MODO having these vectors in its kernel must have K as a right factor. and so there must be a differential operator Q such that [formula]. (In fact, one can check that

[formula]

realizes this factorization.)
