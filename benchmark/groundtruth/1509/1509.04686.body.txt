The fitness of the strongest individual in the subcritical GMS model

Introduction

We consider a discrete time model beginning from an empty set. At each time n  ≥  1, a new species is born with probability p or there is a death (if the system is not empty) with probability q = 1 - p. Let Xn be the total number of species at time n. Xn is a random walk on [formula] that jumps to right with probability p and jumps to left with probability q. When Xn is at 0 the process jumps to 1 with probability p or stays at 0 with probability 1 - p. We assign a random number to each new species. This number has a uniform distribution on

[formula]

Results

We deduce explicitly the distribution of the fitness of the strongest individual on excursions between the epochs when the system becomes empty. The last individual to die before the system becomes empty is the strongest on that excursion because the first ones to die are those individuals with the smallest fitness.

Observe that some excursions may have length 2. When this happens, the individual who is born, dies right away without competing with any other individual. To ensure that each excursion has competition among individuals in a sort of natural selection process, we introduce a change-over on the model: Each time after the system becomes empty, m independent new species are placed on the system (instead of just 1) with probability p, or the system stays empty with probability 1  -  p. We denote this variation by GMS(m). In this set up GMS(1) is the original model.

Figures [\ref=fig:sub1] and [\ref=fig:sub2] show the role of the competition on the distribution of the fitness of the strongest individual on each excursion. Short excursions are more commom on GMS(1) than on GMS(10). That behaviour favors individuals with lower fitnesses to be the strongest ones. Competition introduced in GMS(10) avoids that.

The next result computes the fitness distribution of the strongest individual to die right before the system becomes empty on GMS(m) model. It is shown in terms of the hypergeometric function of Gauss (see Luke [\cite=Luke]). This function is denoted by 2F1(a,b;c;z), namely,

[formula]

where a, b, c, are real numbers with [formula], and (a)k is the coefficient Pochhammer, namely,

[formula]

Let p  ≤  1 / 2 and Zm be the fitness of the strongest individual before the system becomes empty on GMS(m) model. Then Zm is a random variable with distribution

[formula]

Let p  ≤  1 / 2 and Z be the fitness of the strongest individual before the system becomes empty on GMS(1) model. Then

[formula]

For p = 1 / 2, Z follows a Beta distribution B(1,1 / 2).

Proofs

For [formula] we define

[formula]

In words τn is the length of a excursion from 0 to 0. As the process Xn is homogeneous, the distribution of τn does not depend on n so we consider the random variable τ: = τ0. Besides, as p  ≤  1 / 2 we have that [formula] and

[formula]

where T- m is the time of the first visit to - m for a random walk on [formula] beginning at 0. (See Bhattacharya and Waymire [\cite=Batachyara])

If τ = k + 1, we see along that excursion, extra [formula] births and [formula] deaths. The last death corresponds to the individual with the strongest fitness among all [formula] that were born. Hence,
