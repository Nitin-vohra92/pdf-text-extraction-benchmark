Introduction

For analytic functions f,g we consider the Volterra-type integration operator given by

[formula]

There is an extensive literature regarding the boundedness, compactness, and Schatten class membership of Tg on various spaces of analytic functions (see [\cite=cima] [\cite=asis] for Hardy spaces, [\cite=ac] [\cite=asi] [\cite=oc] [\cite=pp] [\cite=ra] [\cite=pelra] for weighted Bergman spaces, [\cite=ggp] [\cite=gp] for Dirichlet spaces, [\cite=oc_f] [\cite=ocpel] for Fock spaces, [\cite=bonet] [\cite=bonet-taskinen] for growth spaces of entire functions, as well as the surveys [\cite=aa] [\cite=sis] and references therein). One of the key tools in all these considerations is a Littlewood-Paley-type estimate for the target space of the operator, which, for a wide class of radial weights, can be obtained by standard techniques. In comparison to the above, there are considerably fewer investigations of its spectrum (see [\cite=ac] [\cite=aleman-pelaez] [\cite=bonet]). The problem of describing the spectrum of Tg is in general quite involved as it requires Littlewood-Paley-type estimates for non-radial weights dependent on the symbol g.

Assuming that g(0) = 0, a straightforward calculation shows that for [formula], the equation

[formula]

has the unique analytic solution

[formula]

Thus the resolvent set of Tg consists precisely of those points [formula] for which Rλ,g is a bounded operator. One useful feature is that the spectrum of Tg is closely related to the behaviour of the exponentials eg / λ, [formula]. Notice that for [formula] in ([\ref=resolvent]) we get Rλ,g1 = eg / λ. This shows that if Tg is bounded on some Banach space X of analytic functions which contains the constants and on which point evaluations are bounded, then eg / λ∈X whenever λ belongs to the resolvent set of Tg. This fact was first noticed by Pommerenke [\cite=pommerenke] in the setting of X = H2, who relied on it in order to provide a slick proof of the John-Nirenberg inequality. Hence, if X is as above, then

[formula]

Whether the reverse inclusion holds for all symbols g for which Tg is bounded depends on the space X. For example, this fails in the case of Bergman spaces and of Hardy spaces (see [\cite=ac] [\cite=aleman-pelaez]).

Another observation worthwhile making is that the point spectrum of Tg is empty. This is an immediate consequence of the form of Tg. In particular, if Tg is compact, then σ(Tg) = {0}.

The aim of this note is to describe the spectrum of Tg when acting on the generalized Fock spaces Fpα,A with [formula], which consist of entire functions f such that

[formula]

where dA denotes the Lebesgue area measure on [formula]. The operator Tg is bounded on Fpα,A if and only if the symbol g is a polynomial of degree ≤  A, while its compactness is equivalent to degree(g) < A (see [\cite=ocpel]). For integer values of A we obtain the following description for the spectrum of Tg:Fpα,A  →  Fpα,A

[formula]

where b is the leading coefficient of the polynomial g (that is, g(z) = bzA + "lower terms"). If [formula], it turns out that the operator Tg is automatically compact once it is bounded, and, since its point spectrum is empty, we obtain σ(Tg) = {0}. The particular case [formula], was treated in [\cite=oc_f] by a method based on the Hilbert space property of the classical Fock space, as well as the explicit formula for its reproducing kernel. Our present approach relies on a suitable application of Stokes' formula, using some properties of the integral means of functions in Fpα,A. The case p =   ∞  , corresponding to growth spaces of entire functions F∞α,A, was recently treated by Bonet in [\cite=bonet].

Main result

Let us begin with some preliminary facts that will be used in our further considerations. The following Littlewood-Paley estimate for Fpα,A was obtained in [\cite=ocpel].

Proposition A. We have

[formula]

for any entire function f.

For an entire function f, the maximum principle and the subharmonicity of |f|p ensure Moreover, if f(0) = 0, the above quantities are comparable to [formula].

The key ingredient in the proof of our main result is the following estimate:

Let [formula] and assume α > |b / λ|. For a positive integer A, let [formula]. If f is an entire function such that feg / λ∈Fpα,A, then the following inequality holds

[formula]

where the involved constants are independent of f.

We shall first prove the statement for functions f that have a zero of order strictly greater than A at zero.

Denote [formula]. Applying Stokes' Theorem and a limiting argument we deduce

[formula]

Above we used the fact that

[formula]

whose proof is deferred for later for the sake of clarity of exposition. To estimate the first integral on the right hand side of ([\ref=stokes]), denoted I1, we write

[formula]

where the last step above follows by Hölder's inequality.

A direct calculation now gives

[formula]

and hence we have

[formula]

Use this in ([\ref=I1]) to get

[formula]

which together with relation ([\ref=stokes]) yields

[formula]

We now claim that the above relation implies

[formula]

if f has a zero of order > A at the origin. Once ([\ref=claim1]) is proven, ([\ref=desired_ineq]) will follow in view of Remark [\ref=remarca]. We use an argument by contradiction. If ([\ref=claim1]) did not hold, then we could find a sequence (fn)∞n = 1 of entire functions with [formula] and [formula]. For any compact [formula], the point evaluation estimate for Fpα,A (see [\cite=ortega] [\cite=ocpel]) gives

[formula]

for some constant cK > 0. This shows that the sequence fn' converges to 0 uniformly on compacts, and hence the same holds for the sequence fn.

From ([\ref=eq:assumed_ineq]) we deduce

[formula]

Since by the maximum principle [formula] tends uniformly to 0 on |z|  ≤  R, the first integral on the right-hand side of the inequality above tends to 0 as n  →    ∞  . We now use the fact that [formula] and let R  →    ∞   to get the desired contradiction.

It remains to show that the condition ([\ref=eq:boundaryterm]) involving the boundary integral holds. By ([\ref=eq:star]) we obtain

[formula]

Let now [formula] and consider [formula]. By assumption, ψ∈Fpα,A, that is,

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Since the integral means Mp,R are increasing in R, this implies that

[formula]

and therefore the right-hand side in ([\ref=eq:boundary_term]) can be written as

[formula]

By L'Hospital's rule we see that the first factor above is bounded and hence ([\ref=eq:boundaryterm]) is proven.

The conclusion for arbitrary f is obtained by applying ([\ref=eq:boundaryterm]) to [formula], taking into account Remark [\ref=remarca], and the fact that

[formula]

which follows by the Cauchy formula and subharmonicity.

Let α,A > 0,  p  ≥  1 and assume Tg:Fpα,A  →  Fpα,A is bounded, that is, g is a polynomial with [formula]. Then we have

If [formula], then σ(Tg) = {0}.

If [formula], then

[formula]

where b is the coefficient of zA in the expansion of g.

If A is not a positive integer, then Tg compact Fpα,A once it is bounded (see [\cite=ocpel]), and since it has no eigenvalues, its spectrum is {0}.

Thus, the only interesting case is [formula], i.e. g is of the form g(z) = bzA + pA - 1(z) where pA - 1 is a polynomial of degree A - 1. Notice that for λ  ≠  0 we have

[formula]

and since the operators [formula] and [formula] are injective, while TpA - 1 is compact on Fpα,A, the study of the spectrum of Tg reduces in this case to study of the spectrum of TbzA. We can therefore assume without loss of generality that g(z) = bzA.

Now it is easy to see that the spectrum of Tg contains the set in the right-hand side of ([\ref=spectru]). Indeed, as explained in Introduction, if λ belongs to the resolvent set of Tg then Rλ,g1 = ebzA  /  λ∈Fpα,A, that is

[formula]

A straightforward argument using polar coordinates shows that this fails if [formula], and hence [formula].

To prove the reverse inclusion, we apply Proposition [\ref=LPF]. We show that if [formula], then the formal resolvent Rλ,g, given by ([\ref=resolvent]), is a bounded operator on Fpα,A. We claim that, for any polynomial f,

[formula]

Indeed, this follows from the estimate

[formula]

taking into account |b  /  λ| < α.

We may now apply Proposition [\ref=LPF] and, subsequently, Proposition A to obtain

[formula]

Since polynomials are dense in Fpα,A (see e.g. [\cite=ocpel]), it follows that Rλ,g is bounded, and, with this, the proof is complete.
