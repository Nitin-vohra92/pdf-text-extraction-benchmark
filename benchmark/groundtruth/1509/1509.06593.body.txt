The essentially chief series of a compactly generated locally compact group

Introduction

Within the theory of locally compact groups, an important place is occupied by the compactly generated groups. From a topological group theory perspective, every locally compact group is the directed union of its compactly generated subgroups, so problems of a local nature can be reduced to the compactly generated case. From a geometric perspective, such groups admit a well-defined geometric structure and are the natural generalization of finitely generated groups. Finally and most concretely, many examples of locally compact groups of independent interest are compactly generated. Any locally compact group that acts geometrically on a proper metric space is compactly generated; for example [formula] is such a group for any Cayley graph Γ of a finitely generated group.

There is an emerging structure theory of compactly generated locally compact groups which reveals that they have special properties, often in a form that has no or trivial counterpart in the theory of finitely generated discrete groups. This theory could be said to begin with the paper Decomposing locally compact groups into simple pieces of P-E. Caprace and N. Monod, [\cite=CM11], in which general results on the normal subgroup structure of compactly generated locally compact groups are derived.

The key insight of Caprace and Monod is to study compactly generated locally compact groups as large-scale topological objects. That is to say, they observe that non-trivial interaction between local structure and large-scale structure places significant restrictions on compactly generated locally compact groups. Of course, these restrictions will always be up to compact groups and discrete groups; e.g. these results are insensitive to, say, taking a direct product with a discrete group. We stress that this theory nonetheless can yield non-trivial results for discrete groups; consider [\cite=SW_13] or [\cite=W_B_16].

The work at hand is a further contribution to the (large-scale topological) structure theory of compactly generated locally compact groups. We first establish finiteness conditions for the lattice of closed normal subgroups. These conditions are then used to prove the existence of a finite chief series, up to compact groups and discrete groups, in any compactly generated locally compact group.

Statement of results

A of a topological group G is a quotient K / L such that K and L are distinct closed normal subgroups of G with L  <  K. We say that K / L is a (topological) if there are no closed normal subgroups of G strictly between L and K.

An for a locally compact group G is a finite series

[formula]

of closed normal subgroups such that each normal factor Gi + 1 / Gi is either compact, discrete, or a topological chief factor of G.

Every compactly generated locally compact group G admits an essentially chief series; indeed, any finite normal series can be refined to an essentially chief series.

Suppose that G is a compactly generated locally compact group. If [formula] is an increasing sequence of closed normal subgroups of G, then there exists an essentially chief series

[formula]

for G such that [formula] is a subset of [formula].

Every compactly generated locally compact group admits an essentially chief series.

A Jordan-Hölder theorem additionally holds for essentially chief series. For our Jordan-Hölder theorem, the association classes of chief factors are uniquely determined:

For a topological group G, normal factors K1 / L1 and K2 / L2 are if [formula] and [formula] for i = 1,2.

If chief factors K1 / L1 and K2 / L2 of G are associated, then there is a third normal factor K / L of G so that each Ki / Li admits a G-equivariant continuous monomorphism into K / L with a dense normal image; see [\cite=RW_P_15]. Associated chief factors are not in general isomorphic as topological groups. The association relation is also not an equivalence relation in general, but it becomes one when restricted to non-abelian chief factors; see [\cite=RW_P_15].

We must also ignore certain small chief factors.

For an l.c.s.c. group G, a chief factor K / L is called negligible if it is either abelian or associated to a compact or discrete factor.

Suppose that G is an l.c.s.c. group and that G has two essentially chief series (Ai)mi = 0 and (Bj)nj = 0. Define

[formula]

Then there is a bijection f:I  →  J where f(i) is the unique element j∈J such that Ai / Ai - 1 is associated to Bj / Bj - 1.

In later work, we show negligible non-abelian chief factors are limited in topological complexity; specifically, they are either connected and compact or totally disconnected with dense quasi-center. We also show the chief factors themselves have a tractable internal normal subgroup structure.

Our results follow from a finiteness property of the lattice of closed normal subgroups, which generalizes results of Caprace-Monod in [\cite=CM11]. The essential tool is given by the ; this graph is a connected locally finite graph on which the group in question acts vertex-transitively with compact open point stabilizers. The finite degree of such graphs along with the usual dimension from Lie theory provide the finiteness from which all other finiteness properties in this paper are deduced.

A family of closed normal subgroups F is filtering if for all N,M∈F, there is K∈F with [formula]. A family D is directed if for all N,M∈D, there is K∈D with [formula].

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group.

If F is a filtering family of closed normal subgroups of G, then there exists N∈F and a closed normal subgroup K of G such that [formula], [formula] is compact, and N / K is discrete.

If D is a directed family of closed normal subgroups of G, then there exists N∈D and a closed normal subgroup K of G such that [formula], K / N is compact, and [formula] is discrete.

Theorem [\ref=thmintro:essential_finiteness] implies additionally the existence of interesting quotients. For a property of groups P, a topological group G is called just-non-P if G does not have P, but every proper non-trivial Hausdorff quotient G / N has property P.

Let P be a property of compactly generated locally compact groups. If all groups with P are compactly presented and P is closed under compact extensions, then for any compactly generated locally compact group G, exactly one of the following holds:

Every non-trivial quotient of G (including G itself) has P; or

G admits a quotient that is just-non-P.

Any quasi-isometry invariant property is stable under compact extensions, so these properties occasionally fall under the previous theorem.

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group that does not have polynomial growth. Then G admits a non-trivial quotient that is just-not-(of polynomial growth).

Preliminaries

Notations and generalities

All groups are taken to be Hausdorff topological groups and are written multiplicatively. Topological group isomorphism is denoted ≃. We use "t.d.", "l.c.", and "s.c." for "totally disconnected", "locally compact", and "second countable."

The collection of closed normal subgroups of a topological group G is denoted N(G). The connected component of the identity is denoted [formula]. For any subset K  ⊆  G, [formula] is the collection of elements of G that centralize every element of K. We denote the collection of elements of G that normalize K by [formula]. The topological closure of K in G is denoted by [formula]. If G acts on a set X, G(x) denotes the stabilizer of x∈X in G.

A topological group is Polish if it is separable and admits a complete, compatible metric. A locally compact group is Polish if and only if it is second countable; cf. [\cite=K95].

For a poset P, a F  ⊆  P in P is a subset of P such that for all N,M∈F, there exists L∈F with L  ≤  M and L  ≤  N. Dual to this notion, D  ⊆  P is a if for all M,N∈D, there is L∈D with M  ≤  L and N  ≤  L.

Chief factors and chief blocks

We here recall the basic theory established in [\cite=RW_P_15]. In the present work, this theory is lightly used to establish the Jordan-Hölder theorem.

A of a topological group G is a quotient K / L such that K and L are distinct closed normal subgroups of G with L  <  K. We say that K / L is a (topological) if there are no closed normal subgroups of G strictly between L and K.

There is a natural notion of equivalence between chief factors:

For a topological group G, normal factors K1 / L1 and K2 / L2 are if [formula] and [formula] for i = 1,2.

Association is not an equivalence relation in general, but it becomes one when restricted to the set of non-abelian chief factors of a topological group G; see [\cite=RW_P_15]. For a non-abelian chief factor K / L, the equivalence class of non-abelian chief factors equivalent to K / L is denoted

[formula]

is called a chief block of G, and the set of chief blocks of G is denoted [formula].

Given a Polish group G and normal subgroups N  ≤  M of G, we say that M / N

[formula]

. We say that M covers or avoids

[formula]

.

Background on locally compact groups

A closed subgroup K of a locally compact group G is if the coset space G / K is compact when equipped with the quotient topology.

A locally compact group G is if every finite subset of G is contained in a compact subgroup. The , denoted [formula], is the union of all closed normal locally elliptic subgroups of G.

For G a locally compact group, [formula] is the unique largest locally elliptic closed normal subgroup of G, and

[formula]

A (real) is a topological group that is a finite-dimensional analytic manifold over [formula] such that the group operations are analytic maps. A Lie group G can have any number of connected components, but [formula] is always an open subgroup of G. The group [formula] of components is thus discrete.

Let G be a locally compact group. If [formula] is compact, then [formula] is compact, and the quotient [formula] is a Lie group with finitely many connected components.

Theorem [\ref=thm:yamabe_radical] suggests a notion of dimension applicable to all locally compact groups.

For a locally compact group G, the , denoted [formula], is the dimension of [formula] as a real manifold.

The non-compact real dimension is always finite. It is superadditive, not subadditive, with respect to extensions. Additionally, [formula] if and only if G is compact-by-(totally disconnected).

The following technical consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm:yamabe_radical] will be useful later:

Suppose G is a locally compact group with closed normal subgroups H < L. If L is connected, then there is a closed normal subgroup [formula] so that [formula] with [formula] compact and H / K discrete. In particular, [formula] is compact.

Let [formula]. The group R is a compact normal subgroup of G and is such that L / R is a Lie group via Theorem [\ref=thm:yamabe_radical]. The group HR / R is a closed subgroup of the Lie group L / R, hence HR / R is a Lie group. Additionally, the connected component of HR / R equals [formula]. The group [formula] satisfies the lemma.

The basic structural properties of Lie groups stated in the proposition below are classical and will be used without further comment.

The only connected abelian Lie groups are groups of the form [formula] for a,b  ≥  0 where [formula] is the circle group.

The factors in the closed derived series of a connected solvable Lie group are themselves connected abelian Lie groups.

A Lie group L has a largest connected solvable normal subgroup, called the of L.

A connected Lie group with trivial solvable radical is . A semisimple Lie group L has discrete center, and [formula] is a finite direct product of abstractly simple groups.

Every closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group.

The dimension of a Lie group L regarded as a real manifold, denoted [formula], is additive with respect to extensions: if [formula] and K is a closed normal subgroup of dimension k, then [formula].

We shall need one further observation about abelian Lie groups.

Let A be a connected abelian Lie group. If [formula] where D is a directed family of closed subgroups of A, then some D∈D is cocompact in A.

Write A as [formula] for some non-negative integers a and b. Since [formula] is compact, we can pass to the quotient [formula] and assume that [formula]. The conclusion now follows by considering the [formula]-linear span of D for each D∈D.

Cayley-Abels graphs

Cayley-Abels graphs play an essential role in the present work. Our discussion of Cayley-Abels graphs is somewhat more technical than usual; this additional complication is necessary to ensure the degree behaves well under quotients.

A Γ  =  (V,E,o,r) consists of a vertex set V  =  VΓ, a directed edge set E  =  EΓ, a map o:E  →  V assigning to each edge an initial vertex, and a bijection r:E  →  E, denoted by [formula] and called edge reversal, such that [formula].

The terminal vertex of an edge is [formula]. A is an edge e such that o(e)  =  t(e). For e a loop, we allow both [formula] and [formula] as possibilities. The of a vertex v∈V is deg (v): = |o- 1(v)|, and the graph is if every vertex has finite degree. The of the graph is defined to be

[formula]

The graph is if the map E  →  V  ×  V by e  ↦  (o(e),t(e)) is injective and no edge is a loop.

An of a graph is a pair of permutations αV:V  →  V and αE:E  →  E that respect initial vertices and edge reversal: αV(o(e)) = o(αE(e)) and [formula]. For simple graphs, automorphisms are just permutations of V that respect the edge relation in V  ×  V.

For G a group acting on a graph Γ and v∈VΓ, the orbit of v under G is denoted Gv. We denote the orbit of an edge e∈EΓ under G by Ge. The action of G gives a Γ / G as follows: the vertex set VG is the set of G-orbits on V and the edge set EG is the set of G-orbits on E. The origin map õ:EG  →  EG is defined by õ(Ge): = Go(e); this is well-defined since graph automorphisms send initial vertices to initial vertices. The reversal :EG  →  EG is given by [formula]; this map is also well-defined. We will abuse notation and write o and r for õ and [formula].

We stress an important feature of quotient graphs: If N is a normal subgroup of G, then Γ / N is naturally equipped with an action of G with kernel containing N. The action of G on Γ / N therefore factors through G / N.

Let G be a group acting on a graph Γ with N a normal subgroup of G.

If deg (Γ) is finite, then deg (Γ / N)  ≤   deg (Γ), with equality if and only if there exists a vertex v∈V of maximal degree such that the elements of o- 1(v) all lie in distinct N-orbits.

For v∈V, the vertex stabilizer in G of Nv is NG(v).

(1) Take v∈VΓ and let Ne be an edge of Γ / N such that o(Ne)  =  Nv. There then exists v'∈Nv and e'∈Ne such that o(e')  =  v', and hence o(ge')  =  v where g∈N is such that gv'  =  v. In other words, all edges of Γ / N starting at Nv are represented by edges of Γ starting at v. Hence deg (Nv)  ≤   deg (v), and deg (Nv)  =   deg (v) if and only if every edge in o- 1(v) is mapped to a distinct edge of Γ / N. Since v∈VΓ was arbitrary, the conclusions for the degree of Γ / N are clear.

(2) Let H be the vertex stabilizer of Nv in G; that is, H is the setwise stabilizer of Nv. That N is normal ensures Nv is a block of imprimitivity for the action of G on VΓ. We thus deduce that G(v)  ≤  H, so G(v)  =  H(v). Since N is transitive on Nv and N  ≤  H, it follows that NG(v)  =  H.

For G a t.d.l.c. group, a graph for G is a connected graph of finite degree on which G acts vertex-transitively so that the vertex stabilizers are open and compact. A Cayley-Abels graph for a locally compact group G is a Cayley-Abels graph for the t.d.l.c. group [formula]. That is to say, a Cayley-Abels graph for a locally compact group G is a locally finite connected graph on which G acts vertex-transitively and such that the vertex stabilizers are open and connected-by-compact.

The following proposition is a standard result; see for example [\cite=CdH14].

Let G be a locally compact group. The group G has a Cayley-Abels graph if and only if G is compactly generated. Moreover, if G is compactly generated, then for every compact open subgroup [formula] of [formula], there exists a Cayley-Abels graph Γ for G such that U is a vertex stabilizer.

The vertices of a Cayley-Abels graph have the same degree, since G acts vertex-transitively by graph automorphisms. This leads to an invariant for compactly generated groups.

If G is a compactly generated locally compact group, the deg (G) of G is the smallest degree of a Cayley-Abels graph for G.

We point out that deg (G) = 0 if and only if G is connected-by-compact, hence we infer the following:

Essential to the work at hand are the groups which act on (Cayley-Abels) graphs like discrete groups.

Given a group G acting on a graph Γ, we say that G acts on Γ if the vertex stabilizer G(v) acts trivially on both the vertices and the edges of Γ for all v∈V.

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group, N be a closed normal subgroup of G, and Γ be a connected graph of finite degree on which G acts vertex-transitively.

If Γ is a Cayley-Abels graph for G, then Γ / N is a Cayley-Abels graph for G / N.

We have deg (Γ / N)  ≤   deg (Γ), with equality if and only if N acts freely modulo kernel on Γ.

(1) The graph Γ / N is connected, and G acts vertex-transitively on Γ / N. Lemma [\ref=lem:quotient:basic](1) ensures that deg (Γ / N) is also finite. The fact that the vertex stabilizers are connected-by-compact and open in G / N follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:quotient:basic](2).

(2) Fix v∈V. Lemma [\ref=lem:quotient:basic] ensures deg (Γ / N)  ≤   deg (Γ) with equality if and only if the elements of o- 1(v) all lie in distinct N-orbits. We thus deduce the first claim of (2), and for the second, it suffices to show the elements of o- 1(v) all lie in distinct N-orbits if and only if N acts freely modulo kernel on Γ.

Suppose N acts freely modulo kernel on Γ. For an edge e of Γ, if o(e) is fixed by g∈N, then ge  =  e. The elements of o- 1(v) thus all lie in distinct N-orbits.

Conversely, suppose the elements of o- 1(v) all lie in distinct N-orbits. Any element of N that fixes v must also fix o- 1(v) pointwise. Each g∈N(v) then fixes t(e), so g fixes all the neighbors of v. We thus conclude N(v)  ≥  N(w) where w∈VΓ is adjacent to v.

As G acts vertex-transitively on Γ and N is normal in Γ, the choice of v is not important, so in fact, N(v')  ≥  N(w') for (v',w') any pair of adjacent vertices of Γ. That Γ is connected now implies all vertex stabilizers of N acting on Γ are equal. Moreover, they fix every edge of Γ, since every edge lies in o- 1(w) for some w∈VΓ. The group N therefore acts freely modulo kernel on Γ.

Finiteness properties of the lattice of closed normal subgroups

We here establish a finiteness property of the lattice of closed normal subgroups. As an immediate consequence, we obtain the existence of certain quotients with an interesting minimality condition.

Directed and filtering families of normal subgroups

Claim (1) of the next lemma is more or less a restatement of [\cite=CM11]. We give a proof for completeness.

Let G be a compactly generated t.d.l.c. group and Γ be a Cayley-Abels graph for G.

Let F be a filtering family of closed normal subgroups of G and set [formula]. Then there exists N∈F such that deg (Γ / N)  =   deg (Γ / M).

Let D be a directed family of closed normal subgroups of G and set [formula]. Then there exists N∈D such that deg (Γ / N)  =   deg (Γ / M).

Fix v∈VΓ. For N∈N(G), the value deg (Γ / N) is determined by the number of orbits of the action of N(v) on the set X of edges issuing from v. Defining α(N) to be the subgroup of [formula] induced by N(v) on X, we see that deg (Γ / N) =  deg (Γ / M) if α(N) = α(M). The assignment N  ↦  α(N) is also order-preserving. For a filtering or directed family N  ⊆  N(G), the family α(N): = {α(N)|N∈N} is then a filtering or directed family of subgroups of [formula]. That [formula] is a finite group ensures α(N) is a finite family, so it admits a minimum or maximum, according to whether N is filtering or directed.

Claim (2) is now immediate. The directed family α(D) admits a maximal element α(N). It then follows that α(N) = α(M), so deg (Γ / N) =  deg (Γ / M).

For (1), an additional compactness argument is required. If G acts freely modulo kernel on Γ, then N∈F and M also act as such. The desired result then follows since deg (Γ / N) =  deg (Γ) =  deg (Γ / M). Let us assume that G does not act freely modulo kernel, so G(v) acts non-trivially on Γ for any v∈VΓ.

Take α(N)∈α(F) to be the minimum. Given r∈α(N), let Y be the set of elements of G(v) that do not induce the permutation r on X. If r  ≠  1, then plainly Y  ≠  G(v). If r = 1, then Y  ≠  G(v) since G(v) acts non-trivially on Γ. The set Y is thus a proper open subset of G(v), whereby [formula] is a non-empty compact set.

Letting K be a finite subset of F, the group [formula] contains some element of F, so α(K)  ≥  α(N). In particular, [formula]. The intersection

[formula]

is therefore non-empty. Compactness now implies that

[formula]

that is, some element of M(v) induces the permutation r on X. Since r∈α(N) is arbitrary, we conclude that α(M)  =  α(N), and so deg (Γ / N)  =   deg (Γ / M).

The conclusion of claim (1) in Lemma [\ref=lem:degree:finiteness] implies that the factor N / M is "discrete" from the point of view of the Cayley-Abels graph.

Let G be a compactly generated t.d.l.c. group with N a closed normal subgroup of G. If there is a Cayley-Abels graph Γ for G such that deg (Γ / N)  =   deg (Γ), then there exists a compact normal subgroup L of G acting trivially on Γ such that L is an open subgroup of N.

In view of Proposition [\ref=prop:degree_of_quotient], N acts freely modulo kernel on Γ. For U the pointwise stabilizer of the star o- 1(v) for some vertex v, the subgroup U is a compact open subgroup of G, and its core K is the kernel of the action of G on Γ. Since N acts freely modulo kernel, we deduce that [formula]. The group [formula] now satisfies the lemma.

Combining our results on Cayley-Abels graphs with the Gleason-Yamabe Theorem, we obtain a result that applies to compactly generated locally compact groups without dependence on a choice of Cayley-Abels graph.

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group.

If F is a filtering family of closed normal subgroups of G, then there exists N∈F and a closed normal subgroup K of G such that [formula], [formula] is compact, and N / K is discrete.

If D is a directed family of closed normal subgroups of G, then there exists N∈D and a closed normal subgroup K of G such that [formula], K / N is compact, and [formula] is discrete.

(1) The group [formula] is a compactly generated locally compact group, so we assume that [formula]. Fix a Cayley-Abels graph Γ for G and let E be the kernel of the action of G on Γ. Since [formula], we have [formula], and [formula] is compact, since [formula] is the core of a compact open subgroup of [formula]. Theorem [\ref=thm:yamabe_radical] thus ensures [formula] is compact and the quotient E / R is a Lie group with finitely many connected components. Observe additionally that [formula].

For N∈N(G), set [formula] and [formula]. Both aN and bN are natural numbers depending on N in a monotone fashion: given N,N'∈N(G) such that N  ≤  N', then aN  ≥  aN' and bN  ≤  bN'. By Lemma [\ref=lem:degree:finiteness], there exists N∈F such that [formula]. Since F is a filtering family, we can choose N so that additionally bN is minimized across N∈F. Fix such an N.

We argue claim (1) holds for N and [formula]. Since R is compact, it suffices to show N / K is discrete. Consider first [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop:degree_of_quotient], [formula] acts freely modulo kernel on Γ, hence N acts freely modulo kernel on Γ. The group [formula] is thus a vertex stabilizer of the action of N on Γ. In particular, [formula] is open in N. It now suffices to show that K is open in [formula].

Consider [formula] and suppose for contradiction that there is an infinite compact identity neighborhood T / R of [formula]. Find [formula] open containing 1 with U  =  UR. For F∈F with F  ≤  N, the minimality of bN implies [formula] is a subgroup of [formula] with the same dimension bN. Consequently, [formula] contains [formula], and

[formula]

We infer that [formula], so F intersects the non-empty compact set [formula]. As F is a filtering family, it follows by compactness that [formula] intersects [formula]. However, this is absurd since [formula].

All identity neighborhoods of [formula] are thus finite, hence [formula] is discrete. Since [formula] is a Lie group, we conclude the group [formula] is indeed discrete, verifying (1) holds for N and K.

(2) Set [formula] and let Γ be a Cayley-Abels graph for G. By Lemma [\ref=lem:degree:finiteness], there exists N∈D such that [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is a Cayley-Abels graph for G / N by Proposition [\ref=prop:degree_of_quotient]. Passing to the quotient G / N and replacing Γ with Γ / N, we may assume that [formula] and that M acts freely modulo kernel on Γ.

Let E be the kernel of the action of G on Γ and let [formula]. Our assumptions ensure that L is open in M. We will now find an F∈D and a closed [formula] so that J is an open subgroup of L and that JF / F is compact; this will prove (2) with K: = JF and N: = F.

As in (1), the group [formula] is compact, and the quotient E / R is a Lie group with finitely many connected components. Let N∈D witness the minimum of the set

[formula]

and consider [formula]. For all D∈D such that D  ≥  N, the quotient [formula] is discrete, by our choice of S. Every element of [formula] thereby has an open centralizer in G, and hence [formula] is centralized by [formula]. As [formula] is open in M,

[formula]

The group LR / S is thus centralized by [formula], and a fortiori, [formula] is abelian.

The group E / S is a Lie group, so LR / S is also a Lie group. We infer [formula] is an open subgroup of LR / S. The component [formula] thus contains a dense subgroup which is formed of a directed union of discrete subgroups of the form [formula]. Since [formula] is a connected abelian Lie group, Lemma [\ref=connected_abelian_approximation] ensures there is some F∈D such that [formula] is cocompact in [formula]. Fix F∈D with this property.

There is a compact set A  ⊆  LR / S so that [formula]. Letting [formula] be the usual projection, [formula] which is compact. Let [formula] be the preimage in L of the connected component of [formula]. We see that [formula] is compact; since R is compact, in fact [formula] is compact.

The subgroup J is invariant under continuous automorphisms of L that fix [formula], so [formula]. Additionally, J is an open subgroup of L. Forming JF, the quotient [formula] is a quotient of the compact group [formula]. We have thus found the desired subgroups, and (2) follows.

Just-non-P quotients

As an immediate application of Theorem [\ref=thm:essential_finiteness], we show certain quotients exist:

For P a property of groups, we say that a non-trivial locally compact group G is if every proper non-trivial quotient of G has P, but G itself does not have P.

The properties P we consider must enjoy the following permanence property: A property P of locally compact groups is if for a compactly generated locally compact group G with a compact normal subgroup N, the group G has P if and only if G / N has P. Quasi-isometry invariant properties are closed under compact extensions; see [\cite=CdH14].

A compactly generated locally compact group G is called if there is a compact generating set S so that G has a presentation 〈S|R〉 where the relators R have bounded length. Being compactly presented is a quasi-isometry invariant property of compactly generated locally compact groups; see [\cite=CdH14].

Let P be a property of locally compact groups. If all groups with P are compactly presented and P is closed under compact extensions, then for any compactly generated locally compact group G, exactly one of the following holds:

Every non-trivial quotient of G (including G itself) has P; or

G admits a quotient that is just-non-P.

Let F be the collection of proper closed normal subgroups N of G so that G / N fails to have property P. If [formula], then G satisfies (1), and we are done. Assuming [formula], we claim increasing chains in F have upper bounds. Let (Nα)α∈I be an ⊆  -increasing chain and put [formula]. Suppose for contradiction G / L has property P; in particular, G / L is compactly presented.

Appealing to Theorem [\ref=thm:essential_finiteness], we may find γ∈I and a closed [formula] so that Nγ  ≤  K  ≤  L with L / K discrete and K / Nγ compact. The group G / L is a quotient of G / K with kernel L / K. Moreover, since G / L is compactly presented, [\cite=CdH14] implies the discrete group L / K is finitely normally generated as a subgroup of G / K.

Let X  ⊆  L / K be a finite normal generating set. Since [formula] is dense in L and K is open in L, we may find Nβ for some β  >  γ so that NβK / K contains X. The normality of Nβ implies that indeed NβK = L. The group G / L is thus a quotient of G / Nβ with kernel KNβ / Nβ. The kernel KNβ / Nβ is compact, so G / Nβ is a compact extension of G / L. Hence, G / Nβ has property P, an absurdity.

We conclude that increasing chains in F have upper bounds. Applying Zorn's lemma, we may find N∈F maximal. The maximality of N ensures every proper non-trivial quotient of G / N has property P, verifying (2).

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group with compact symmetric generating set X. The group G has polynomial growth if there are constants C,k > 0 so that μ(Xn)  ≤  Cnk for all n  ≥  1, where μ is the Haar measure. Having polynomial growth is a quasi-isometry invariant property, and compactly generated locally compact groups with polynomial growth are necessarily compactly presented, [\cite=CdH14].

The following corollary is now immediate from Theorem [\ref=thm:just-non-P].

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group.

If some quotient of G is not compactly presented, then G admits a quotient that is just-non-(compactly presented).

If G does not have polynomial growth, then G admits a quotient that is just-not-(of polynomial growth).

We remark that groups in which all proper quotients are compactly presented satisfy a stronger version of Theorem [\ref=thm:essential_finiteness](2).

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group so that every proper quotient of G is compactly presented. If D is a directed family of closed normal subgroups of G, then there exists N∈D such that [formula] is compact.

Without loss of generality [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:essential_finiteness](2), there exists M∈D and a closed normal subgroup K of G such that [formula], [formula] is discrete, and K / M is compact. The group [formula] is compactly presented, so [formula] is normally generated in G by a finite set. It now follows there exists M  ≤  N∈D such that [formula]. In particular, [formula] is compact, as required.

Essentially chief series

An for a compactly generated locally compact group G is a finite series

[formula]

of closed normal subgroups such that each normal factor Gi + 1 / Gi is either compact, discrete, or a topological chief factor of G.

We now show that any compactly generated locally compact group admits an essentially chief series; more precisely, any finite normal series can be refined to an essentially chief series.

Existence of essentially chief series

We begin with two technical results which prove the existence of essentially chief refinements of normal series, with bounds on the number of factors required. These lemmas deal with the connected case and totally disconnected case, respectively.

Suppose that G is a compactly generated locally compact group, H  ≤  L are closed normal subgroups of G, and [formula]. If L / H is connected-by-compact, then there is a series

[formula]

of closed normal subgroups of G with k  ≤  2d + 1 such that each factor Gi + 1 / Gi is either compact, discrete, or a chief factor of G. Additionally, at most d factors are non-compact.

Let us first assume that L / H is connected and [formula]; we will here prove the result with k  ≤  2d. In this situation, we have that L / H is a Lie group and [formula]. There is then i  ≤  d and a series [formula] of closed G-invariant subgroups such that each of the factors Mj / Mj - 1 = :Vj is connected, has positive dimension, and has no proper closed G-invariant subgroup of positive dimension.

For each 1  ≤  j  ≤  i, the factor Vj is either compact, a non-compact semisimple Lie group such that G permutes transitively the simple factors, or [formula] such that G acts irreducibly. If Vj is compact, we do nothing. In the second case, we take Nj such that [formula]. The factor Nj / Mj - 1 is then discrete, and Mj / Nj is a chief factor of G. For the last case, every proper closed G-invariant subgroup of Vj is either trivial or a lattice. If G does not preserve a lattice, then Vj is already a chief factor. If G preserves a lattice Nj / Mj - 1, then Nj / Mj - 1 is discrete, and Mj / Nj is compact.

By including the Nj terms as needed, we obtain a G-invariant series from H to L with at most k  ≤  2d factors such that each factor is compact, discrete, or a chief factor. Additionally, at most d of the factors are non-compact, since each Vj contributes at most one such factor if it is abelian and at most two in the semisimple case. Let us make a further observation for later use: If there are exactly 2d factors in the series, then each Vj is one-dimensional, hence abelian, and divided into a discrete factor Nj / Mj - 1 and a compact factor Mj / Nj.

For the general case, let L' be the preimage of [formula] and let H' be the preimage of [formula]. By our work above, there is a G-invariant series from H' to L' with at most 2d factors of the appropriate form. Since both H' / H and L / L' are compact, we immediately obtain the required G-invariant series from H to L with at most l + 2 factors where l  ≤  2d such that at most d are non-compact. If l  =  2d, the uppermost factor in the series from H' to L' can be combined with L / L', so we find a series with 2d + 1 factors. We thus deduce that there is an essentially chief series from H to L with at most 2d + 1 factors such that at most d factors are non-compact.

Suppose that G is a compactly generated locally compact group, H  ≤  L are closed normal subgroups of G, and Γ is a Cayley-Abels graph for G so that deg (G) =  deg (Γ). If [formula], then there exists a series

[formula]

of closed normal subgroups of G with n  ≤   deg (Γ / H) -  deg (Γ / L) such that

for 0  ≤  i  ≤  n, Ki / Ci is compact, and Di / Ki is discrete; and

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, Ci / Di - 1 is a chief factor.

Set k: =  deg (Γ / H) and m: =  deg (Γ / L). By induction on i  ≤  k - m, we prove there exists a series

[formula]

such that claims (1) and (2) hold of all factors up to i, and there is i  ≤  j  ≤  k - m for which Di is maximal among normal subgroups of G such that deg (Γ / Di) = k - j and that Di  ≤  L.

For i = 0, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:degree:finiteness] and Zorn's lemma that there exists D0 maximal such that deg (Γ / D0) = k and H  ≤  D0  ≤  L. The graph Γ / H is a Cayley-Abels graph for G / H with degree k, and

[formula]

Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:ess_discrete_char], there is [formula] so that H  ≤  K0  ≤  D0 with K0 / H compact, open, and normal in D0 / H. We conclude that C0 = H, K0, and D0 satisfy the inductive claim when i = 0 with j = 0.

Suppose we have built our sequence up to i. By the inductive hypothesis, there is i  ≤  j  ≤  k - m so that Di is maximal with deg (Γ / Di) = k - j and Di  ≤  L. If j = k - m, then the maximality of Di implies Di = L, and we stop. Else, let j' > j be least so that there is [formula] with deg (Γ / M) = k - j' and Di  ≤  M  ≤  L. We take [formula] to be minimal so that deg (Γ / Ci + 1) = k - j' and Di  <  Ci + 1  ≤  L; Lemma [\ref=lem:degree:finiteness] ensures such a subgroup exists.

Consider a closed [formula] with Di  ≤  N < Ci + 1. Putting deg (Γ / N) = l, Proposition [\ref=prop:degree_of_quotient] implies k - j'  ≤  l  ≤  k - j, and the minimality of Ci + 1 further implies k - j' < l. On the other hand, we chose j' > j least so that there is [formula] with deg (Γ / M) = k - j' and Di  ≤  M  ≤  L. Therefore, l = k - j. In view of the maximality of Di, we deduce that Di = N and that Ci + 1 / Di is a chief factor.

Applying again Lemma [\ref=lem:degree:finiteness], there is [formula] maximal so that

[formula]

and Ci + 1  ≤  Di + 1  ≤  L. Lemma [\ref=lem:ess_discrete_char] supplies [formula] so that Ci + 1  ≤  Ki + 1  ≤  Di + 1 with Ki + 1 / Ci + 1 compact and open in Di + 1 / Ci + 1. This completes the induction.

Our procedure halts at some n  ≤  k - m. At this stage, Dn = L, verifying the theorem.

We now use Lemmas [\ref=lem:chief_refinement:connected] and [\ref=lem:chief_refinement:tdlc] to refine a normal series factor by factor to produce an essentially chief series.

Let G be a compactly generated locally compact group and let (Gi)m - 1i = 1 be a finite ascending sequence of closed normal subgroups of G. Then there exists an essentially chief series for G

[formula]

so that

[formula] is a subset of [formula]; and

if [formula], then [formula], and at most [formula] of the factors Ki + 1 / Ki are neither compact nor discrete.

Let us extend the series by G0: = {1} and Gm: = G obtaining the series

[formula]

For each [formula], we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:chief_refinement:connected] to H: = Gj and L so that [formula] to refine the series. We then refine again by applying Lemma [\ref=lem:chief_refinement:tdlc] to L: = Gj + 1 and H so that [formula]. This yields the desired refined series claimed in (1).

For (2), suppose [formula]; say that [formula] for some 0  ≤  k  ≤  m - 1. For each i < k, Lemma [\ref=lem:sgrp_con] yields a closed normal Hi + 1 of G with Gi  ≤  Hi + 1  ≤  Gi + 1 so that Gi + 1 / Hi + 1 is discrete and Hi + 1 / Gi is connected-by-compact. We may thus apply Lemma [\ref=lem:chief_refinement:connected] to each of the pairs Gi  ≤  Hi + 1 with i < k to produce a refined series. (If k = 0, there is nothing to do at this stage.)

In the refined series, there are at most [formula] terms T so that Gi  ≤  T  <  Gi + 1. Additionally, at most [formula] factors are neither compact nor discrete. The number of terms in our refined series strictly below Gk is thus at most

[formula]

and the total number of factors that are neither compact nor discrete is at most

[formula]

We now consider the series [formula]. If G = Gk, we are done; we thus suppose that Gk < G. Let Γ be a Cayley-Abels graph for G with deg (Γ) =  deg (G) and put kj: =  deg (Γ / Gj). For each [formula], we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:chief_refinement:tdlc] to each pair Gj  ≤  Gj + 1 to obtain a refined series. This results in a series in which the number of terms T so that Gj  ≤  T  <  Gj + 1 is at most 3(kj  -  kj + 1) + 2, and at most kj  -  kj + 1 of the factors are neither compact nor discrete. The total number of terms in the refined series not including Gm is thus at most

[formula]

and the total number of non-compact, non-discrete factors is at most

[formula]

Putting together our two refined series, we obtain an essentially chief series

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Furthermore, the number of factors that are neither compact nor discrete is at most [formula].

Uniqueness of essentially chief series

We finally obtain a Jordan-Hölder theorem for essentially chief series, using the general properties of associated chief factors obtained in [\cite=RW_P_15]. For this uniqueness result, we need to exclude chief factors associated to compact and discrete factors.

For G a Polish group and K / L a chief factor of G, we say that K / L is negligible if K / L is either abelian or associated to a compact or discrete chief factor. A chief block [formula] is negligible if [formula] has a compact or discrete representative. The collection of non-negligible chief blocks of G is denoted [formula]. See Subsection [\ref=sec:chief_factor] for the definitions of the association relation and chief blocks.

Using the general methods outlined in [\cite=CM11], one can produce negligible chief factors which are neither abelian, compact, nor discrete.

In contrast to the results about existence of chief series, we do not need to assume that G is compactly generated for our Jordan-Hölder theorem.

Suppose that G is an l.c.s.c. group and that G has two essentially chief series (Ai)mi = 0 and (Bj)nj = 0. Define

[formula]

Then there is a bijection f:I  →  J, where f(i) is the unique element j∈J such that Ai / Ai - 1 is associated to Bj / Bj - 1.

Theorem [\ref=thmintro:Schreier_refinement] provides a function [formula] where f(i) is the unique element of [formula] such that Ai / Ai - 1 is associated to a subquotient of Bf(i) / Bf(i) - 1.

If Bf(i) / Bf(i) - 1 is compact or discrete, then Ai / Ai - 1 is associated to a compact or discrete factor of G, which contradicts our choice of I. The factor Bf(i) / Bf(i) - 1 is thus chief, and Ai / Ai - 1 is associated to Bf(i) / Bf(i) - 1. Theorem [\ref=thmintro:Schreier_refinement] implies Bf(i) / Bf(i) - 1 is also non-abelian. Since association is an equivalence relation for non-abelian chief factors, we conclude that Bf(i) / Bf(i) - 1 is non-negligible, and therefore, f(i)∈J.

We thus have a well-defined function f:I  →  J. The same argument with the roles of the series reversed produces a function f':J  →  I such that Bj / Bj - 1 is associated to Af'(j) / Af'(j) - 1. Since each factor of the first series is associated to at most one factor of the second by Theorem [\ref=thmintro:Schreier_refinement], we conclude that f' is the inverse of f, hence f is a bijection.

If G is a compactly generated l.c.s.c. group, then each [formula] is represented exactly once in every essentially chief series for G, and [formula].

Let (Gi)ni = 0 be an essentially chief series for G. For [formula], fix a representative [formula] and use Theorem [\ref=thm:chief_series] to refine the series {1}  ≤  A < B  ≤  G to a chief series (Hi)ki = 0. Theorem [\ref=thm:association_map] now implies there is a unique 0  ≤  i < n so that A / B is associated to Gi + 1 / Gi. Hence, [formula]. On the other hand, association is an equivalence relation, so the uniqueness of i implies that Gi + 1 / Gi is the only representative of [formula] appearing in (Gi)ni = 0. The chief block [formula] is thus represented exactly once in any essentially chief series for G.

For the second claim, we use Theorem [\ref=thm:chief_series] to produce (Ki)mi = 0 an essentially chief series for G that refines the series [formula]. By the previous paragraph, each [formula] admits exactly one representative with the form Ki + 1 / Ki for some 0  ≤  i < m. Moreover, such a representative must be neither compact nor discrete. Theorem [\ref=thm:chief_series] ensures that we can choose (Ki)mi = 0 so that the number of non-compact, non-discrete factors is at most [formula], hence [formula].

To conclude this section, we note that each non-negligible block of a compactly generated group admits a unique smallest closed normal subgroup covering it; this somewhat technical observation will be useful in a later work. See Subsection [\ref=sec:chief_factor] for the definition of a normal subgroup covering a chief block.

Let G be a compactly generated l.c.s.c. group with [formula]. Then there is a closed normal subgroup [formula] of G such that for every closed normal subgroup K of G, K covers [formula] if and only if [formula].

Let K be the set of closed normal subgroups of G that cover [formula] and set [formula]. By [\cite=RW_P_15], the set K is a filtering family, and thus, Theorem [\ref=thm:essential_finiteness] ensures there exists L∈K and [formula] such that M is G-invariant and open in L and [formula] is compact.

We now consider the series

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thmintro:Schreier_refinement] implies that one of L / M, [formula], or [formula] covers [formula]. As [formula] is non-negligible, neither the discrete factor L / M nor the compact factor [formula] covers [formula]. We deduce that [formula] covers [formula], hence every closed normal subgroup of G that contains [formula] covers [formula]. Since every closed normal subgroup of G that covers [formula] contains [formula] by construction, the proposition is verified.
