Biased doped silicene as a source for advanced electronics

Introduction

After revolutionary breakthrough of graphene, introducing unusual relativistic effects into solid state physics [\citep=Geim], the family of relative materials is continuously growing. In particular, a possibility of obtaining new semiconducting materials where the bandgap can be tuned by external electric bias is extensively studied. This was first demonstrated for the graphene bilayer, called bigraphene [\citep=cast]. Unlike the basic monolayer graphene, here a non-equivalence of two sublayers takes place under electric field applied normally to them. Opening of a tunable semiconducting gap and perspectives of its practical use in tunable transistors is now broadly discussed. The same possibility was already indicated in a variety of similar systems, including even single layered, as, for instance, silicene, the Si-based analog of graphene [\citep=Guzman]. Its important structural difference from graphene consists in a much more pronounced buckling of its 2D hexagonal lattice, thus leading to a non-equivalence of two sublattices in the same layer and to opening of a bandgap under normal-to-plane electric bias[\citep=Ni] [\citep=Quhe] [\citep=Stille] [\citep=Zand]. Subsequently, fabrication of practical field-effect transistors based on a silicene sheet is extensively sought for [\citep=Drum] [\citep=Li] [\citep=Zand].

When comparing these 2D systems with common semiconductors, an important question arises on their behavior under doping by impurity atoms. As well known, such doping in common semiconductors produces localized in-gap energy levels near the edges of conduction band (called donor levels) or valence band (acceptor levels) [\citep=Shklo]. For mostly used dopants (as Si neighbors from the periodic table) these levels are very shallow (of some tens meV depth compared to some eV bandwidths) so that charge carriers can be thermally excited from them to the nearby band (conduction or valence) and thus contribute into conduction of respective kind (electron or hole). The resulting conductivity turns sensitive to external bias realized in specific devices, defining their effectiveness [\citep=Sze]. Typical dopant concentration n is quite low, in order to assure the mean distance  = n- 1 / 3 between dopants to surpass the long effective radius of localized state rloc  ≫  a (the lattice parameter), it should not exceed [formula] cm- 3 (for 3D systems). Then it is known that for n  ≫  n0 the doped system is brought to metallization [\citep=Roth], due to growing interaction between dopants and subsequent broadening of the dopant level. Hence the Fermi level, initially fixed at the dopant level, becomes displaced to the band interior. This phenomenon is generally considered adverse for electronics purposes, since it drastically reduces the bias sensitivity. Otherwise, an alternative type of impurities (as transition and rare-earth elements), producing the so called deep levels in the semiconducting gap [\citep=Watkins], are not effective for thermalization of carriers and instead can act as traps for them.

The above limitations however can be effectively overcome under the possibility for tuning the fundamental bandgap and also other relevant spectrum characteristics as the Fermi level and the Mott's mobility edges [\citep=mott]. This opens a formerly unexplored perspective of bringing the bias sensitivity of conduction to a much broader scale then in common semiconductors, spanning it from metallic to insulating regimes through the Mott's metal-insulator transition (MIT). The purpose of the present study is to illustrate such an expectation on the particular example of biased and doped silicene, considering both situations of shallow and deep dopant levels with their specific regimes. Though a detailed treatment of these issues, using the realistic impurity potentials, their screening by relativistic electrons, etc., can present certain technical problems, it can be much facilitated with use of simplified models, traditionally applied for impurities both in common semiconductors and in graphene-related materials. Such are the Lifshitz model [\citep=lif], better suited for shallow dopants, and the Anderson hybrid model [\citep=and], more adequate for deep dopants. Below we analyze the electronic spectra of biased and doped silicene within these two models and indicate possible tuning regimes to reach desirable effects.

Formulation of the problem

For the silicene hexagonal lattice with two non-equivalent sites in unit cell (Fig. [\ref=eq:1]), we write down the tight-binding Hamiltonian as:

[formula]

Here 2-spinors [formula] are made of 2D Fourier transforms [formula] and [formula] of local Fermi operators at A- and B-type sites in the [formula]-th unit cell (N the total number of cells). The 2×  2 Pauli matrix expansion [formula] includes the on-site energy shifts ±  V / 2, due to the effect of buckling and external electric field, referred to as bias in what follows, and the complex factors [formula], due to the hopping amplitude [formula] eV between nearest neighbor sites separated by the vectors [formula] with their xy-plane components [formula] nm and normal buckling components [formula] [\citep=Cahan] [\citep=Jose]. For sake of simplicity, relatively weak spin-orbit interactions and spin degrees of freedom are omitted in Eq. [\ref=eq:1]. The relevant low-energy physics is generated near the nodal points [formula] in the Brillouin zone so that for [formula] with [formula] we have [formula] where the Fermi velocity vF = 3at / (2 and [formula].

We study electronic states in this system using the Green function (GF) matrix [formula]that satisfies the equation of motion:

[formula]

for the full Hamiltonian H. Generally, the GF matrix defines the system energy spectrum by the roots of the general dispersion equation: [formula], that is by the poles of its diagonal elements in the basis of exact eigen-states, and the total density of states (DOS) is defined as:

[formula]

in any basis. Using of Eq. [\ref=eq:2] with the unperturbed Hamiltonian, H = H0, Eq. [\ref=eq:1], leads to a momentum-diagonal form for the non-perturbed GF matrix [formula] where:

[formula]

and [formula] is an effective momentum variable for the relevant low-energy range, |ε|  ≪  Λ (where [formula] is the bandwidth, that is an energy cut-off). In this approximation, the electronic spectrum consists of two symmetric bands [formula] with a gap of V between them. The related non-perturbed DOS is linear beyond this gap:

[formula]

and normalized: [formula]. This situation in silicene with buckled lattice is referred to as realization of a tunable gap between the lower (valence) band and the higher (conduction) band, in contrast to a fixed gap in common semiconductors (like crystalline Si).

Now we pass to the specifics of doping this system by impurity atoms at random sites within its crystalline lattice that produce its perturbation through the above referred Lifshitz and Anderson models.

Lifshitz model

We begin with the simpler Lifshitz model [\citep=lif] characterized by a single perturbation parameter, the on-site energy shift U on all impurity atoms located at [formula] sites in the 1st sublattice and [formula] sites in the 2nd sublattice with relative concentrations c1,2 (both expectedly small, [formula]). Such substitutional type better corresponds to impurities such as Si neighbors in the periodic table. The corresponding Lifshitz perturbation reads:

[formula]

with the scattering matrices Ûj = Up̂j and the sublattice projectors [formula]. In this model with the full Hamiltonian H = H0 + HL, the explicit equation of motion for the momentum-diagonal GF matrix:

[formula]

leads to the standard solution:

[formula]

Here the partial self-energy functions are presented by their respective group expansions (GE's) [\citep=iva]:

[formula]

where the partial T-matrix [formula] with local GF's [formula] describes the effects of multiple scatterings on single impurity center. It can be generally shown that the GE series, Eq. [\ref=eq:9], is converging within the energy range of band-like states and can be well approximated there by its first T-matrix term while the rest of terms are important for the check of convergence. The first of non-trivial GE terms is due to impurity pairs:

[formula]

and includes the functions [formula] of inter-impurity interaction. It should be also noted that all the products of these functions in the expansion of Eq. [\ref=eq:10] are presented by multiple sums in non-coinciding momenta [\citep=iva] [\citep=ILP]. The omitted terms in the brackets of Eq. [\ref=eq:9] correspond to clusters of three and more impurities, they are expressed through respective combinations of these functions.

Generally, once the initial translation symmetry of crystalline lattice is broken by the presence of impurities, the quasi-momentum is no longer an exact quantum number and also the system spectrum is not limited to the initial bands, since already a single impurity can produce localized levels beyond the bands. However, for not too strong a disorder, this spectrum maintains continuous ranges of band-like states (both the modified initial bands and possibly some new, impurity, bands arisen near localized levels), intercalated by the ranges of truly localized states (either on single impurities or on their clusters). Within band-like ranges, the approximate dispersion laws of corresponding subbands [formula] (in our case, j = 1,2,imp for two initial and impurity bands respectively) are given by the formal roots of the above mentioned dispersion equation in the [formula]-basis:

[formula]

However their validity is restricted by the known Ioffe-Regel-Mott (IRM) criterion [\citep=ir] [\citep=mott] that for this case takes the form:

[formula]

with the damping term [formula] for [formula]. The separation points between extended and localized ranges, called Mott's mobility edges, are estimated from the condition that the symbol "≪  " in Eq. [\ref=eq:12] is changed for "~  ", ending validity of the IRM criterion. This also qualitatively agrees with a similar change in the convergence criterion for GE: [formula]. Within the bandgap, the broadening Γj mainly results from [formula] in Eq. [\ref=eq:9], so analysis of this range needs calculation of the functions gj and [formula]. A reasonable approximation for them follows from substitution of [formula] by [formula] in corresponding sums resulting in:

[formula]

and:

[formula]

(see details in Appendix). Here the characteristic length [formula] and the McDonald function [formula] has asymptotics [\citep=Abst]:

[formula]

with the Euler's constant [formula].

The logarithmic divergence of gj, Eq. [\ref=eq:13], near one of the gap edges allows a localized level εloc to appear there under a proper impurity perturbation. Thus, if one chooses for definiteness U < 0 (and supposedly [formula]), this level is due to the pole of T1 (by impurities in 1st sublattice) near the upper edge V / 2, their separation being well approximated as:

[formula]

Hence the localized level is exponentially shallow for all practically achievable bias values (always V  ≪  Λ), which can justify such modeling of real shallow levels. At this choice, another term T2 (by impurities in 2nd sublattice) has no poles and is less relevant.

Further analytical study of modified spectrum uses some approximated energy dependencies of the relevant T1-matrix. Thus, in a close enough vicinity to the localized level, |ε  -  εloc|  ≪  V / 2 - εloc, its denominator can be linearized:

[formula]

while in a wider area, 0 < V / 2 - ε  ≪  V, the logarithmic approximation applies:

[formula]

At last, when considering the energy scales over the whole band gap, [formula], the complete formula, Eq. [\ref=eq:13], should be used in the T-matrices.

Of course, for U > 0, symmetric formulas with respect to Eqs. [\ref=eq:15], [\ref=eq:16], [\ref=eq:17] apply for the pole of T2 near the lower gap edge and for its related vicinities while T1 becomes irrelevant.

Let us focus now on the most restructured region of spectrum, including the impurity band εimp(ξ) and its closest neighbor areas of ε1,2(ξ) bands. In this course, it is convenient to consider this restructuring with growing bias V at fixed impurity parameters U and c. The T-matrix approximation[formula] is sufficient at the first step, as far as the quasiparticle lifetime and respective IRM limits for band-like states are not considered.

At lowest bias V  ≪  c|U|, the numerical solution of the dispersion equation, Eq. [\ref=eq:11], with use of Eq. [\ref=eq:13], shows the spectrum restructuring to be very close to its simple shift by cU, that is the impurity effect is reduced to that of effective medium potential. Formally, this solution includes the impurity band εimp(ξ) of c|U| width and separately the modified upper subband ε1(ξ). However, it is seen from Fig. [\ref=Fig2](inset a) that their composition is closely matched near the εloc level and practically coincides with a single shifted law: [formula], attaining its lower edge at ξ = 0: [formula]. As seen from Fig. [\ref=Fig2](inset b), such composite ε1  +  εimp-band structure persists for low enough bias such that c  ≪  c0, and, using Eq. [\ref=eq:15], this relates to: [formula](the latter value to be explained below). Noting from Eq. [\ref=eq:14] at ε  =  εloc that the localization radius is [formula], this refers to [formula], a 2D analogy to the metallization condition discussed in Introduction. Thus, the characteristic concentration c0 (in fact, an analog to n0 in Introduction) is bias tuned, and a tuned Anderson transition on the εimp-band (merger of its mobility edges and vanishing of band-like states [\citep=and]) is expected at the bias value VA.

At growing bias to V  ≫  c|U|, the composite band structure can be described with use of Eq. [\ref=eq:17]. Then the renormalized dispersion law ε  =  εimp(ξ) follows from Eq. [\ref=eq:11] in an implicit form as:

[formula]

This equation permits analytic solutions near the edges of εimp-band. Thus, the lower edge corresponds to [formula]:

[formula]

where [formula] is the Lambert W-function [\citep=corless]. Its asymptotics, [formula], used in Eq. [\ref=eq:19] provide a simpler function:

[formula]

replacing the above linear εg dependence at V  ≪  c|U| in the wider range of V  ≪  VA. At yet higher bias, up to V  ~  VA, the full Eq. [\ref=eq:19] applies.

Expanding Eq. [\ref=eq:18] at ξ2  ≪  V2 / 4 - ε2g, the long-wave dispersion law is obtained:

[formula]

indicating the εcomp-behavior for [formula]. The further growth of εimp(ξ) finally reaches the short-wave asymptotics (at ξ2  ≫  cΛ2):

[formula]

This defines its formal upper edge [formula] , and then the total width of impurity band:

[formula]

Growing with V from the initial value of c|U|, Λimp by Eq. [\ref=eq:23] would reach a maximum at some [formula] with the factor [formula] varying from [formula] to [formula] in the range of 10- 4 < c < 0.1. However, such V* is already close to the critical value VA and hence to the impurity band collapse, making this maximum meaningless.

The next step is to determine the lifetimes of the obtained quasiparticle states, in order to establish the IRM limits for their existence. For the quasiparticle with energy [formula], we can consider its effective broadening:

[formula]

Using it in the IRM criterion, Eq. [\ref=eq:12], we estimate the location of the mobility edge εc near the bottom of εimp: εc  -  εg  ~  cU2V / Λ2. It is negligible beside the gap of V between the ε2- and εimp-bands and the width Λimp of εimp-band. However, the broadening, Eq. [\ref=eq:24], at ε  ≈  εloc much exceeds the formal gap ≈  V / 2 - εloc (here exponentially small) between εimp- and ε1-bands. This permits to consider such gap and the very level εloc non-existing and justifies the concept of a composite band in the weak bias regime (see insets a,b in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]).

The overall electronic state of the doped system is determined by the location of its Fermi level [formula] with respect to the mobility edges. Supposing each impurity atom to supply one carrier to the system and its undoped state to possess [formula]=0, its position at finite c is found from the equation:

[formula]

(including the spin factor 2). For the weak bias regime (or, in other words, for c0  ≪  c), one can use here the composite band DOS: [formula], and obtain the bias dependent Fermi level within this band as:

[formula]

At low enough bias, [formula], it lies as high within the εcomp-band as [formula] (Fig. [\ref=Fig2]) and defines a metallic behavior of the system. This can be just compared to metallization of common semiconductors at high enough doping (c  ≫  c0).

With growing bias, [formula] gets closer to the band's bottom εg but its expected crossing of a mobility edge and the system transition into insulating state can be only reached after the decomposition of εimp and ε1 bands by means of an emerging localized range around the impurity level εloc. From comparison of Eqs. [\ref=eq:15] and [\ref=eq:24], this is estimated to take place at [formula]. The related bias value is high enough:

[formula]

including the lower branch W- 1 of the multivalued Lambert function with asymptotics [formula] for - 1 / e < z < 0 [\citep=corless]. However, this Vdec is yet well below the εimp-band collapse value VA (see inset c in Fig.[\ref=Fig2]). Then, taking into account the T-matrix contribution to DOS for the lower decomposed subband :

[formula]

and using it in Eq. [\ref=eq:25], we find the condition that [formula] reaches the top of εimp:

[formula]

Implicitly, Eq. [\ref=eq:29] defines the bias value VM that can be associated with the tuned MIT, provided this value be above Vdec so that the top of εimp already pertain to the localized range. The MIT bias value is estimated from Eq. [\ref=eq:29] as:

[formula]

where the factor in the logarithm depends on the perturbation parameter as: [formula], by a reasonable empirical fit. Then, the numerical comparison between Eqs. [\ref=eq:27] and [\ref=eq:30] shows that Vdec in fact precedes VM for all realistic [formula]. But the sequence of tuned MIT and Anderson transitions can be changed depending on the impurity parameters. So, the VA  →  VM sequence for their above choice (as in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]) passes to VM  →  VA for c = 0.01 and |U| > 0.71Λ. With the bias V exceeding VA, the impurity band does not make sense already but there exists a well defined localized level, Eq. [\ref=eq:15], whose width at c  ≪  c0 estimated from the GE pair term (see details in Appendix) becomes exponentially small: [formula].

The above discussed tuned restructuring of spectrum can be summarized as follows. At low bias, V  ≪  VM, the system is metallized by the impurity doping, with the Fermi level lying deep within the composite ε1+εimp-conduction band. The composite band gets split into ε1- and εimp-bands, separated by the range of localized states around the impurity level εloc, at bias reaching Vdec. At further growing bias to VM, the Fermi level meets the mobility edge above εloc to produce MIT. After the Anderson transition occured at V = VA, a single ε1 conduction (unoccupied) band is left in the spectrum, the Fermi level staying fixed near εloc. All the critical bias values, Vdec, VM, and VA, can be reduced by choosing lower impurity concentration, but this reduction is as slow as [formula] and simultaneously the thermal stability level for MIT is reduced as [formula].

Now let us consider the alternative scenario, or the Anderson hybrid model.

Anderson hybrid model

In the Anderson model, there are two perturbation parameters: the on-site energy ε0 for an electron at an impurity atom and its modified hopping amplitude ηt (supposedly [formula]) to the nearest neighbor host sites. Such type of impurity perturbation better corresponds to transition metal or rare-earth atoms, known to produce deep levels in common Si. In silicene, these atoms predominantly occupy interstitial positions, linked to both host sublattices (see Fig. [\ref=Fig3]). In the corresponding perturbation Hamiltonian:

[formula]

this linkage is presented through the 2-spinor [formula]. The other difference of this model consists in the presence of independent Fermi operators [formula] for an electron on impurity site [formula], besides the above considered host operators in the [formula] spinor. Subsequently, it generates more involved GF structures (with respect to the sublattice indices): besides the "host" [formula] matrices by Eq. [\ref=eq:2], here also "impurity" [formula] scalars and "mixed" [formula] and [formula] spinors appear.

Under the full Hamiltonian H = H0 + HA, the equation of motion for the "host" GF matrix gets modified from Eq. [\ref=eq:7] to:

[formula]

and the respective equation for the "mixed" [formula] spinor in its right hand side reads as:

[formula]

Then the specific solutions for all the above mentioned GF types follow from consequent iterations of Eqs. [\ref=eq:32] and [\ref=eq:33].

The general strategy consists in separating, after each iteration step, all the GF's in the right hand side that were already present in the previous steps and doing next iteration for the resting ones, in order to compose and then fully solve an equation for each GF. The most important between them are the diagonal [formula] and [formula] that enter the total DOS

[formula]

in the generalization of Eq. [\ref=eq:3]. Thus, a full solution for [formula] follows from Eq. [\ref=eq:32] (at [formula]), after separating the same [formula] in the right hand side of Eq. [\ref=eq:33] for [formula] and applying again Eq. [\ref=eq:32] to all [formula] with [formula] there. At this next iteration, a similar separation of [formula] is also done, giving rise to a respective full solution for [formula], and so on. The result, formally analogous to Eq. [\ref=eq:8]:

[formula]

includes the self-energy matrix in the GE form, similar to Eq. [\ref=eq:9]: [formula]. But here the T-matrix term:

[formula]

has an important difference from the Lifshitz model form, Eq. [\ref=eq:9], in its momentum dependence, both on the radial variable [formula] and on the angular argument [formula]. It also includes the single impurity level [formula] (reduced by its coupling to the host) with its imaginary part [formula] and the "impurity" scalar self-energy:

[formula]

Here the scalar functions

[formula]

describe the effects of indirect interactions between impurity centers. The latter A  -  ' functions also define the GE terms of the "host" self-energy [formula], along the same formal structure as in Eq. [\ref=eq:10], while the GE structure for the scalar [formula] in Eq. [\ref=eq:37] is notably different. In this way, the solution for the diagonal "impurity" GF follows as:

[formula]

and can be then used in Eq. [\ref=eq:34]. A specific feature of [formula] is the random statistical distribution of its values due to random ' positions around given [formula], with the standard deviation [formula]. Since a finite range of inter-impurity interactions, this deviation does not vanish in the thermodynamical limit N  →    ∞  , unlike that for [formula] (known as the self-averaging property [\citep=lifgrepas]). As to the mean self-energy [formula], it can be simply included into the definition of impurity level εimp, so understood in what follows.

In this model, we present the basic secular determinant as [formula], with the scalar self-energy:

[formula]

Then the general Eq. [\ref=eq:11] (written at the T-matrix level in neglect of Γimp and [formula]) reads:

[formula]

where the reduced impurity concentration [formula] measures the quasiparticle weight transfer from impurity to band states. Eq. [\ref=eq:40] defines the dispersion laws for "host" quasiparticles that are quite close to the non-perturbed [formula] except for the εimp vicinity of ~  εimp width where the splitting of two subbands is mainly developed. Within that splitting range, both subbands strongly deviate from [formula] and display a sensible in-plane anisotropy: [formula] (Fig. [\ref=Fig4]), unlike the isotropically split subbands in Fig. [\ref=Fig2]. Physically, this anisotropy reflects the breakdown of local inversion symmetry for an impurity interstice at applied field bias.

Other difference from the Lifshitz model is in the possibility that, at varying bias V, the impurity level εimp can be crossed by the band edge V / 2. Lastly, the presence of ξ2 factor in the T-matrix, Eq. [\ref=eq:36], leads to vanishing damping for long-wave quasiparticles, so that the mobility edges should correspond to shorter wavelengths (to be defined below). This implies that Bloch-like states with such short wavelengths would not make sense at energies close enough to the impurity level.

As a result, the composition of electronic spectrum in the Anderson model is more complicated than in the Lifshitz model. Here we have generally up to three subbands of the states by electrons on host sites: the two split [formula] subbands and the almost non-perturbed [formula] (valence) subband, together with a subband of the states on impurity interstices (Eq. [\ref=eq:38]). The important separation between band-like and localized states can be established from the following principle. A given energy ε pertains to the range of band-like states by virtue of those solutions of Eq. [\ref=eq:39] that satisfy the IRM criterion, and if no such solutions exist, this energy pertains to the range of localized states by virtue of the related solutions of Eq. [\ref=eq:38]. All these states contribute to the total DOS with their particular weights defined by the residues of corresponding poles of diagonal GF's in Eq. [\ref=eq:34].

Following this principle, one can apply the IRM criterion, Eq. [\ref=eq:12], for almost isotropic band-like states beyond the splitting range, |ε  -  εimp|  ≫  εimp, but will need its more complete form:

[formula]

within this range. Expecting the most important mobility threshold to be located below εimp, we focus on the relevant damping term [formula]. There are several additive contributions to this term, due to Γimp and [formula] in the denominator of [formula], Eq. [\ref=eq:36], and to the GE terms such as [formula]. A more detailed analysis shows that the dominating contribution comes from [formula], expressing the decay rates of band quasiparticles into the randomly distributed localized levels [formula]. This contribution is already self-averaging and its average involves the probability distribution function [formula]. Since [formula] by Eq. [\ref=eq:37] is a sum of a great number of independent random values like [formula], this probability distribution should take a normal form:

[formula]

that readily implies:

[formula]

Now, to evaluate the standard deviation σ, we restrict [formula], Eq. [\ref=eq:37], to its first term and approximate the interaction function by using the non-perturbed GF (see details in Appendix):

[formula]

Since within the relevant energy range for this case, V / 2 < ε, the argument of McDonald functions turns to be imaginary, they can be expressed through the 1st and 2nd kind Bessel functions [\citep=Abst]: [formula] and [formula]. Notice the presence of p-wave anisotropy by cos θ = nx / n in Eq. [\ref=eq:43], similar to that of the dispersion law, Eq. [\ref=eq:39]. Next we obtain (see Appendix):

[formula]

presenting an energy-dependent [formula] that grows at approach to the single impurity level εimp, as it can be expected for such resonance interactions. In Eqs. [\ref=eq:43], [\ref=eq:44], c0 = |ε2imp - V2 / 4| / Λ2 generalizes the definition in Eq. [\ref=eq:15] for the locations of band edge V / 2 either above and below εimp, and the meaning of ccr  =  ε2imp  /  Λ2 is explained in what follows. Using the result by Eq. [\ref=eq:44] in Eq. [\ref=eq:42], we conclude that the relevant damping term [formula] very steeply shoots up from exponentially low to values as high as [formula] when reaching the condition [formula] or:

[formula]

So Eq. [\ref=eq:45] gives just an estimate for the distance from εimp to the mobility edge εc. We notice that, for c close to ccr and c0, this distance exceeds the width εimp of the splitting range that justifies the above usage of the non-perturbed spectrum in Eq. [\ref=eq:43]. Also, the estimate by Eq. [\ref=eq:45] defines the above referred minimum admitted wavelength of band quasiparticles with energies near εimp: [formula].

The principal practical issue of tuned metal-insulator transition is resolved by comparing the mobility edge εc and the Fermi level [formula] whose initial position at zero bias is below εimp if the impurity concentration is smaller of the above defined critical value: c < ccr. Expecting the crossing of [formula] with εc at growing bias to occur outside the splitting range, we can safely estimate [formula] with use of the non-perturbed DOS, Eq. [\ref=eq:5], in Eq. [\ref=eq:25] to result in:

[formula]

instead of Eq. [\ref=eq:26]. Then the MIT bias VM, when the Fermi level crosses the mobility edge, is found for the Anderson model as:

[formula]

that is slightly below the critical value [formula], when the Fermi level reaches εimp (as shown in Fig. [\ref=Fig5]). With further growing bias, V > Vcr, the Fermi level stays fixed near εimp while the Anderson transition for the [formula] subband takes place when the mobility edge is attained by the band edge V / 2. This corresponds to [formula].

Finally, at V > VA, the impurity level εimp stays below the bottom of the almost unperturbed main band (as in Fig. [\ref=Fig5]d), then [formula] and so the broadening of εimp becomes exponentially small [formula] (at c0  ≫  c) by virtue of similar decay of [formula] in Eq. [\ref=eq:43] and there are almost unperturbed subbands [formula] in the spectrum (alike the above case of the Lifshitz model).

Discussion and conclusions

The above presented considerations of electronic spectrum in biased and doped silicene within the frameworks of two models for impurity perturbation show a variety of restructuring processes in this spectrum with different dynamics for its particular subbands, derived from both the initial host subbands and from the impurity levels. The main difference between the two models is in the location of impurity energy level. In the Lifshitz model, it is εloc, Eq. [\ref=eq:15], which closely follows the biased edge of one of the main subbands while in the Anderson model it is the bias independent εimp, Eq. [\ref=eq:33], that can be crossed by the biased main band edge. This determines the difference in spectrum transformations with growing bias V.

In the Lifshitz model, the initial metallic state at V  ≪  VM corresponds to the Fermi level [formula] well above εloc and the tuned MIT is realized through its dropping down to the mobility edge that emerges near εloc after the impurity subband gets decoupled from its neighbor main subband at V > Vdec. This process develops rather slowly with growing bias and requires the stronger critical level VM the higher impurity concentration c is present in the sample. In contrast, the Anderson model provides a possibility for initial [formula] to be positioned below εimp and to reach the mobility edge with growing bias, the sooner the higher c is chosen. These scenarios can be suitably presented in the form of phase diagrams in terms of the relevant variables "impurity concentration-electric bias" (Fig. [\ref=Fig6]).

These diagrams for the two models clearly display the above mentioned difference in electronic phase dynamics. In the Lifshitz model, the critical value as a function of impurity concentration, [formula], grows (logarithmically slowly) (Fig. [\ref=Fig6]a), while in the Anderson model this function is rapidly decreasing from its initial value [formula] (Fig. [\ref=Fig6]b). Also, there is a notable difference in behavior of other phase boundary in this case which defines the Anderson transition in the collapsing impurity band. In the Lifshitz model, [formula] grows in a similar way to [formula] and, depending on the perturbation parameter U, a crossing of these two can take place. By contrast, [formula] in the Anderson model is practically constant: [formula].

It is readily seen from Eq. [\ref=eq:47] that a considerable reduction of the MIT bias can be reached by driving the impurity concentration c close enough to ccr. This is an essential advantage of the Anderson model scenario compared to that of the Lifshitz model, also taking into account that growing c simultaneously improves the thermal stability of tuned MIT. The other practical advantage here is in a much higher steepness [formula] of this transition. This is seen from the comparison of corresponding values: [formula], [formula] for the Lifshitz model in Fig. [\ref=Fig3] and [formula], [formula] for the Anderson model in Fig. [\ref=Fig5]. The latter advantage is even more enforced by the fact that the damping of Fermi quasiparticles (defining the Drude resistivity of metal) at V  →  VM varies slowly in the Lifshitz model, as in Eq. [\ref=eq:24], but grows exponentially in the Anderson model, as in Eq. [\ref=eq:42], enabling here an extremely strong variation of the doped system resistivity near the tuned MIT.

Summarizing, the doped and biased silicene presents a suitable opportunity for realization of practical electronic devices with tunable electric resistivity over a very broad scale, from normal metallic to fully insulating (possibly accompanied by respective optical, thermal, etc. effects), under rselatively weak bias. This regime can be optimized by a proper choice of impurity atoms, their location within the crystalline structure, and their concentration. The comparative analysis of two common models for impurity perturbation on the host electronic spectrum indicates the Anderson hybrid model (adequate for transition or rare earth impurities in silicene) to be more promising for such purpose. Comparing the present system to the other known material with tunable gap, the bigraphene, where similar doping effects were recently considered [\citep=PSL], an advantage of the silicene host is seen in the simpler structure of its electronic spectrum. Experimental checks on the proposed regimes of doping and tunable phase transitions could better determine the field for future studies and probably open some new possibilities in this direction.

Appendix

Quasimomentum sums over the Brillouin zone (BZ) commonly result in certain analytic functions of other relevant arguments (such as position vectors, energy, etc.), and their calculation is done by passing from sum to integral

[formula]

where vBZ is the BZ volume. In the present case, the 2D BZ consists of two equilateral triangles with side [formula], each centered in a nodal point, and the above integration of a function [formula] that decays fast enough away from the nodal points can be approximately done in the radial and angular variables ξ, φ over the circle of radius Λ:

[formula]

Among all the functions that have no such decay and so do not admit such approximation, we distinguish the important case of plane wave, [formula], providing an exact result:

[formula]

where the discrete Dirac delta is [formula] for any [formula] joining two lattice sites (or two interstices) and [formula].

Now we apply these techniques to the calculation of the basic interaction functions [formula] and [formula] in the approximation of non-perturbed spectrum. Starting from the definition in the Lifshitz model, Eq. [\ref=eq:10], we obtain (at ε2 < V2 / 4):

[formula]

the result in Eq. [\ref=eq:14]. In particular, its asymptotics at n  ≫  rε defines the broadening of localized impurity level at c  ≪  c0, by the criterion [formula], where:

[formula]

Therefore the above criterion takes place at [formula], as indicated after Eq. [\ref=eq:30].

For the Anderson model, with the definition by Eq. [\ref=eq:37], we have (at ε2 > V2 / 4):

[formula]

Then, applying Eq. [\ref=eq:50] to the first sum in the right hand side of Eq. [\ref=eq:51] gives two terms proportional to [formula] and [formula], that vanish for any [formula]. The second sum is treated by means of Eq. [\ref=eq:49] as follows:

[formula]

and, after extending the upper integration limit to infinity, the exact formulas can be used:

[formula]

with the 2nd kind Hankel functions [formula] [\citep=Abst] and b = n / |rε|. This leads finally to the result of Eq. [\ref=eq:43].

Now let us consider the standard deviation of the random scalar self-energy [formula]:

[formula]

restricting the definition of [formula] in Eq. [\ref=eq:37] to its first term, of the lowest linear order in impurity concentration. Then we present:

[formula]

where the random numbers [formula] of impurity occupation at [formula]th interstice take the values 1 with probability c and 0 with probability 1 - c and the non-renormalized denominators ε  -  εimp correspond to the adopted precision to the lowest order in c. Using this in Eq. [\ref=eq:53] and taking into account that [formula], [formula] at [formula] and [formula], we obtain:

[formula]

The decisive point in the evaluation of this sum over interstices is that the products [formula] do not include Fourier components with coinciding quasimomenta (see after Eq. [\ref=eq:10]). Using the inverse orthogonality relation to Eq. [\ref=eq:50], [formula], we present the relevant sum as:

[formula]

where [formula] is prevailed by

[formula]

with

[formula]

This triple sum in [formula] is dominated by its real part, mainly due to the short-wave contributions by [formula], and it can be estimated by the triple integral in ξj  =  Fkj:

[formula]

(the φ-oscillating terms in [formula] are not important for this result). This readily leads to the expressions in Eqs. [\ref=eq:44] and [\ref=eq:45].

Finally, the broadening of localized impurity level at V / 2 > εimp is obtained in the same way as shown above for the case of the Lifshitz model at c  ≪  c0, with only difference for the pre-exponential factor c0Λ, here resulting from the dominant contribution by the second term in Eq. [\ref=eq:43].
