Are number fields determined by Artin L-functions?

Introduction

Let k be a number field, K / k a finite Galois extension with Galois group G, χ a faithful character of G. In Theorem [\ref=thm6] we prove that the Artin L-function L(s,χ,K / k) determines the Galois closure [formula] of K over [formula]. In the special case [formula] we prove in Theorem [\ref=thm5] that the Artin L-function determines K and the (faithful) character χ. We give examples that in the case [formula] we cannot expect more, especially there exist non-isomorphic arithmetically equivalent fields which cannot be distinguished by Artin L-functions.

The restriction to faithful characters is natural: let K / k be a finite normal extension with Gal(K / k) = G, and let χ be a character of G with Ker  (χ)  ≠  {1}. Let F be the fixed field of Ker  (χ), H: = G / Ker  (χ) the Galois group of F / k,  [formula], φ(σKer  (χ)): = χ(σ) for σ∈G. We have that

[formula]

and φ is faithful.

As particular cases we obtain that the Dedekind zeta function of a number field determines its normal closure ([\cite=Pe], Theorem 1, p. 345) and that a Galois number field is determined by any Artin L-function corresponding to a character which contains all irreducible characters of the Galois group, the result of [\cite=Ni2].

Properties of Artin L-Functions

We do not give the definition of Artin L-functions, but we recall some fundamental properties of Artin L-functions needed in the sequel. Note that Artin L-functions are generalizations of Dedekind zeta functions ζK via

[formula]

where K is a number field and 1 is the trivial character of the trivial group Gal(K / K). We get further possibilities to write a Dedekind zeta function as a Artin L-function by using Propositions [\ref=prop1] and [\ref=prop2].

Let k be a number field, K / k a finite Galois extension with Galois group G, χ a character of G. Let N be a finite Galois extension of k which contains K, U: = Gal(N / k), V: = Gal(N / K). We identify the groups G and U / V. Let

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

This follows straightforward from the definition of L-functions: [\cite=Ar], p. 297, formula (8).

Let k be a number field, K / k a finite Galois extension with Galois group G. Let k  ⊆  F  ⊆  K be an intermediate field, H: = Gal(K / F), χ a character of H, and χG be the induced character on G. Then we have

[formula]

This is a deep property proved by Emil Artin: [\cite=Ar], p. 297, formula (9).

Let [formula] be a finite Galois extension with Galois group G, χ and φ characters of G. If

[formula]

then

[formula]

This follows from the definition of Artin L-functions and Tschebotarev's density theorem. Alternately, it was proved in [\cite=Ni1], p. 179, Theorem 1 that if χ  ≠  φ then the functions [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent over [formula].

We remark that Proposition [\ref=prop3] is not true for Artin L-functions in Galois extensions K / k with base [formula]. E.g. let [formula] be a normal S3-extension and denote by k the unique quadratic subfield of [formula]. Then Gal(K / k)  =  C3, the cyclic group of order 3. Denote by χ2 and χ3 the two non-trivial characters of C3. Then by Proposition [\ref=prop2] we get for j = 2,3:

[formula]

Using χS32  =  χS33 we get that L(s,χ2,K / k)  =  L(s,χ3,K / k), but χ2  ≠  χ3.

Results

Let k be a number field, K / k a finite Galois extension with Galois group G, and χ be a faithful character of G. Let [formula] be the Galois closure of K over [formula], [formula] the Galois group of [formula], U: = Gal( / k), and V: = Gal( / K). We identify the groups G and U / V. Let

[formula]

and let [formula] be the induced character of [formula] on [formula]. Then [formula] is faithful, and

[formula]

We have

[formula]

since χ is faithful. We have

[formula]

since [formula] is the Galois closure of K over [formula]. We have

[formula]

hence [formula] is faithful. We have

[formula]

by Propositions [\ref=prop1] and [\ref=prop2].

We prove that a Galois number field is determined by any Artin L-function corresponding to a faithful character of the Galois group.

Let [formula], [formula] be finite Galois extensions. For j = 1,2 let Gj be the Galois group of [formula], χj a faithful character of Gj. If

[formula]

then

[formula]

Let N: = K1  ·  K2. For j = 1,2 let

[formula]

where we identify Gj with the factor group [formula]. Then [formula] is a character of [formula], and

[formula]

since χj is faithful. We have

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=prop1]. If [formula] then

[formula]

hence, by Proposition [\ref=prop3],

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

hence

[formula]

and, by Proposition [\ref=prop3],

[formula]

In the final example of this paper we show that we cannot expect a similar result to Theorem [\ref=thm5] for normal extensions Kj / k for [formula] and j = 1,2. In the next theorem we give a version for relative extensions.

Let k1 and k2 be number fields. For j = 1,2 let Kj / kj be a finite Galois extension with the Galois group Gj, [formula] the normal closure of Kj over [formula], χj a faithful character of Gj, Uj: = Gal( / kj), Vj: = Gal( / Kj). We identify the groups Gj and Uj / Vj. Let

[formula]

Let [formula], and let [formula] be the induced character of [formula] on [formula]. If

[formula]

then

[formula]

and

[formula]

For j = 1,2 the character [formula] is faithful and we have

[formula]

by Proposition [\ref=prop4]. If

[formula]

then

[formula]

hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=thm5].

We obtain now the well-known result ([\cite=Pe], Theorem 1, p. 345) that the zeta function of an algebraic number field determines its normal closure.

Let K1 and K2 be number fields. For j = 1,2 let [formula] be the normal closure of Kj over [formula], Vj: = Gal( / Kj), [formula], and let 1Vj be the trivial character of Vj. If

[formula]

then

[formula]

and

[formula]

For j = 1,2 let kj = Kj, Gj  =  {1}, χj: = 1Gj, Uj: = Vj. The character χj is faithful, and

[formula]

We have

[formula]

hence

[formula]

If

[formula]

then

[formula]

hence

[formula]

and

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=thm6].

We finish with an example which shows that all Artin L-functions in the Galois closures of the corresponding fields coincide. Let [formula], [formula], [formula]. The extensions K1 / k and K2 / k are Galois with Galois groups G1 and G2 of order 2. The fields K1 and K2 are non-isomorphic and have the same zeta function ( [\cite=Pe], p. 350 ):

[formula]

For j = 1,2 we have

[formula]

where χj is the non-trivial irreducible character of Gj. We have

[formula]

hence

[formula]

It follows that the Artin L-functions of K1 / k are identical with the Artin L-functions of K2 / k. We have

[formula]

by Theorem 6, since RegG1 and RegG2 are faithful. Using the notation of Theorem [\ref=thm6], there is an outer automorphism α of G such that

[formula]

The Artin L-functions of  / K1 are identical with the Artin L-functions of  / K2. This shows that K1 and K2 cannot be distinguished by Artin L-functions of  / K1 and  / K2, nor by Artin L-functions of K1 / k and K2 / k.
