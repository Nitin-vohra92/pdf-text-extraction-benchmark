The Lusztig automorphism of [formula] from the equitable point of view

Introduction

This paper is about the quantum algebra [formula], but in order to motivate things we have some preliminary comments about the Lie algebra [formula]. Let [formula] denote a field with characteristic zero, and consider the Lie algebra [formula] over [formula]. The following facts are taken from [\cite=humphreys]. The Lie algebra [formula] has a basis e,f,h and Lie bracket

[formula]

On each finite-dimensional [formula]-module, h is diagonalizable and e,f are nilpotent. The Lie algebra [formula] has an automorphism

[formula]

where ad  u  (v)  =  [u,v] and [formula]. The automorphism L sends

[formula]

The operator

[formula]

acts on nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules. On these modules,

[formula]

We are done discussing [formula]. We now turn our attention to the analog situation for [formula]. From now on, let the field [formula] be arbitrary. Fix a nonzero [formula] that is not a root of 1, and consider the algebra [formula] over [formula]. By [\cite=jantzen], the Chevalley presentation of [formula] has generators e,f,k±  1 and relations kk- 1 = 1, k- 1k = 1,

[formula]

The Lusztig automorphism L of [formula] was introduced in [\cite=lusztig1] [\cite=lusztig2] as a quantum analog of ([\ref=eq:sl2L]). By [\cite=jantzen], L sends

[formula]

The Lusztig operator T was introduced in [\cite=lusztig1] [\cite=lusztig2] as a quantum analog of ([\ref=eq:sl2T]). T acts on a family of finite-dimensional [formula]-modules, said to have type 1. This family is described as follows. A nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-module V has type 1 if and only if k is diagonalizable on V, with all eigenvalues among [formula]. Assume that V has type 1. For [formula] the corresponding weight space V(λ) = {v∈V|kv = qλv}. By [\cite=jantzen] we find that on each weight space V(λ),

[formula]

(The bracket notation is explained in Section 2.) By [\cite=jantzen], on V the operator T is invertible and

[formula]

The equitable presentation of [formula] was introduced in [\cite=equit] and investigated further in [\cite=alnajjar] [\cite=bocktingTer] [\cite=bidiag] [\cite=irt] [\cite=qtet] [\cite=nomura] [\cite=tersym] [\cite=uawe] [\cite=fduq] [\cite=billiard] [\cite=lrt] [\cite=wora]. This presentation has generators x,y±  1,z and relations yy- 1  =  1, y- 1y  =  1,

[formula]

In Section 5 we explain how x,y,z are related to e,f,k. This relationship is not unique. From the set of possible relationships we select two that seem attractive (see Corollary [\ref=cor:goodtheta]); these exist provided that [formula]. For the rest of this section, assume that [formula] and adopt one of the two selections.

Our goal for this paper is to describe how L and T look in the equitable presentation. We now describe L. Define

[formula]

By [\cite=equit],

[formula]

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules, each of x,y,z is invertible (see Lemma 5.19) and each of nx,ny,nz is nilpotent (see Lemma 5.17). By [\cite=uawe], the algebra [formula] is generated by nx,y±  1,nz. As we will see in Corollary 5.21, L sends

[formula]

We now describe T. We define an operator Υ that acts on finite-dimensional [formula]-modules of type 1. Let V denote such a module. On each weight space V(λ), Υ acts as q-  λ2 / 2 times the identity. We recall the notion of a rotator. This notion is implicit in [\cite=equit] and explicit in [\cite=fduq]; see also [\cite=lrt]. Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. A rotator on V is an invertible R∈End(V) such that on V,

[formula]

Recall the q-exponential function

[formula]

As we will see in Lemma 9.8, the operator

[formula]

acts as a rotator on each finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. We can now easily describe T in the equitable presentation. In Theorem 9.9 we show that on each finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1,

[formula]

We have been describing the Lusztig automorphism L and the Lusztig operator T. For both maps there is a second version, which we denote by [formula] and [formula], respectively. The maps [formula] are treated along with L,T in the main body of the paper.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains some preliminaries. Section 3 contains some basic facts about the Chevalley presentation of [formula]. In Section 4 we discuss how the Lusztig automorphisms [formula] and the Lusztig operators [formula] look in the Chevalley presentation. In Section 5 we discuss the equitable presentation of [formula], and describe how [formula] look in this presentation. In Section 6 we review the q-exponential function, and apply it to nx,ny,nz. Section 7 is about rotators. In Sections 8, 9 we use rotators to describe how the Lusztig operators [formula] look in the equitable presentation. Theorem [\ref=thm:LOm] is the main result of the paper.

Preliminaries

We now begin our formal argument. Throughout the paper the following notation and assumptions are in effect. An algebra without the Lie prefix is meant to be associative and have a 1. Recall the natural numbers [formula] and integers [formula]. Let [formula] denote a field, and let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. Let End(V) denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the [formula]-linear maps from V to V. An element φ∈End(V) is called diagonalizable whenever V is spanned by the eigenspaces of φ. The map φ is called multiplicity-free whenever φ is diagonalizable, and each eigenspace has dimension one. The map φ is called nilpotent whenever there exists a positive integer n such that φn = 0. Fix a nonzero [formula] that is not a root of 1. For [formula] define

[formula]

and for n  ≥  0 define

[formula]

We interpret [0]!q  =  1.

The Chevalley presention of [formula]

We recall the quantum algebra [formula] in the Chevalley presentation, following the treatment in [\cite=jantzen].

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra with generators e,f,k±  1 and relations

[formula]

The elements e,f,k±  1 are called the Chevalley generators for [formula].

By an automorphism of [formula] we mean an [formula]-algebra isomorphism from [formula] to [formula].

(See [\cite=jantzen].) There exists a unique automorphism ω of [formula] that sends

[formula]

Moreover ω2 = 1.

We now recall the Casimir element of [formula].

Let Λ denote the following element in [formula]:

[formula]

We call Λ the (normalized) Casimir element.

The element Λ(q - q- 1)- 2 is the Casimir element of [formula] discussed in [\cite=jantzen].

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The elements [formula] form a basis for the center of [formula].

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The automorphism ω fixes Λ.

We now describe the finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-modules.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) There exists a family of finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-modules

[formula]

with the following properties: [formula] has a basis {vi}di = 0 such that

[formula]

Each finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-module is isomorphic to exactly one of the modules from line ([\ref=eq:Lde]).

We have some comments about Lemma [\ref=lem:irred].

The [formula]-module [formula] has dimension d + 1.

Referring to line ([\ref=eq:Lde]), if [formula] then we view {1, - 1} as containing a single element.

On the [formula]-module [formula] the element k is multiplicity-free, with eigenvalues {εqd - 2i  |  0  ≤  i  ≤  d}.

On the [formula]-module [formula], each of er,fr is nonzero for 0  ≤  r  ≤  d, and

[formula]

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The Casimir element Λ acts on [formula] as ε(qd + 1 + q- d - 1)I.

Referring to the [formula]-module [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:irred], we call d and ε the diameter and type, respectively. We often abbreviate [formula].

Next we consider finite-dimensional [formula]-modules that are not necessarily irreducible.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The elements e and f are nilpotent on every finite-dimensional [formula]-module.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module. Then the following are equivalent:

the action of k on V is diagonalizable;

V is a direct sum of irreducible [formula]-submodules.

Moreover, if [formula] then the conditions (i), (ii) hold.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module. Then V is said to have type 1 whenever [formula] and V is a direct sum of irreducible [formula]-submodules that have type 1.

Let V denote a nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-module. Then the following are equivalent:

V has type 1;

the action of k on V is diagonalizable, and each eigenvalue is among [formula].

(i)  ⇒  (ii) By Lemma [\ref=lem:kmf] and Definitions [\ref=def:VD], [\ref=def:typeONE]. (ii)  ⇒  (i) By Lemmas [\ref=lem:kmf], [\ref=lem:CR] and Definitions [\ref=def:VD], [\ref=def:typeONE].

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then each nonzero [formula]-submodule of V has type 1.

Apply Lemma [\ref=lem:kWS] to the [formula]-submodule in question.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. For [formula] define

[formula]

We call V(λ) the λ-weight space of V. Note that [formula] if and only if qλ is an eigenvalue of k on V, and in this case V(λ) is the corresponding eigenspace.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Referring to Definition [\ref=def:WS], for each weight space V(λ) we have

[formula]

Each finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1 is a direct sum of its weight spaces.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:kWS] and Definition [\ref=def:WS].

Let V denote a [formula]-module, and let σ denote an automorphism of [formula]. There exists a [formula]-module structure on V, called V twisted via σ, with the following property: for all [formula] and v∈V, the vector ξv computed in V twisted via σ is equal to the vector σ- 1(ξ)v computed in the original [formula]-module V. Sometimes we abbreviate [formula] for V twisted via σ.

Recall the automorphism ω of [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:omega].

Let V denote a [formula]-module. Then the action of e (resp. f) (resp. k) on [formula] coincides with the action of f (resp. e) (resp. k- 1) on V.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then the [formula]-module [formula] has type 1.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:kWS] and the assertion about k in Example [\ref=ex:omegaTwist].

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then for all [formula] the following coincide:

the λ-weight space of [formula];

the ( - λ)-weight space of V.

By Definition [\ref=def:WS] and the assertion about k in Example [\ref=ex:omegaTwist].

The Lusztig automorphism of [formula]

In this section we recall the Lusztig automorphism of [formula]. Our treatment follows [\cite=jantzen], more or less. The Lusztig automorphism has two versions, which we now define.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The Lusztig automorphism L of [formula] sends

[formula]

The Lusztig automorphism [formula] of [formula] sends

[formula]

The inverses of L and [formula] are described as follows.

The automorphism L- 1 sends

[formula]

The automorphism [formula] sends

[formula]

Routine using Definition [\ref=def:LusztigAut].

We now explain how L and [formula] are related.

The following diagram commutes:

Chase the [formula] generators e,f,k±  1 around the diagram using Definition [\ref=def:LusztigAut].

Here is another view. Recall the automorphism ω of [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:omega].

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The following diagram commutes:

Chase the [formula] generators e,f,k±  1 around the diagram, using Lemma [\ref=lem:omega] and Definition [\ref=def:LusztigAut].

Consider the Lusztig automorphisms L and [formula]. Associated with L (resp. [formula]) is a certain operator T (resp. [formula]) called its Lusztig operator, that acts on each type 1 finite-dimensional [formula]-module in an [formula]-linear fashion. We now give the action.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) The Lusztig operators T and [formula] act as follows. Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. On each weight space V(λ),

[formula]

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then T and [formula] are invertible on V. On each weight space V(λ),

[formula]

We now describe how [formula] act.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Refer to the basis {vi}di = 0 of [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:irred]. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d,

[formula]

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then for [formula],

[formula]

The operators T and [formula] are related in the following way.

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. On each weight space V(λ),

[formula]

Here is another way to relate T and [formula].

(See [\cite=jantzen].) Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then the following coincide:

the action of T on [formula];

the action of [formula] on V.

Use Example [\ref=ex:omegaTwist] along with Lemmas [\ref=lem:KactionTwist1], [\ref=lem:KactionTwist] and Definition [\ref=def:lusztigOp].

The Lusztig automorphism L (resp. [formula]) is related to the Lusztig operator T (resp. [formula]) in the following way.

On each finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1,

[formula]

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. On V, L(ξ)  =  TξT- 1 holds by [\cite=jantzen]. The [formula]-module [formula] has type 1 by Lemma [\ref=lem:KactionTwist1], so the equation L(ξ)  =  TξT- 1 holds on [formula]. Evaluating this equation using Definition [\ref=def:twist] and Lemmas [\ref=lem:CD2], [\ref=lem:TTVrelate] we find that [formula] holds on V.

The equitable presentation of [formula]

In this section we recall the equitable presentation of [formula]. For more information on this topic see [\cite=alnajjar] [\cite=bocktingTer] [\cite=bidiag] [\cite=irt] [\cite=qtet] [\cite=equit] [\cite=nomura] [\cite=tersym] [\cite=uawe] [\cite=fduq] [\cite=billiard] [\cite=lrt] [\cite=wora]. See also [\cite=benkter].

(See [\cite=equit].) The algebra [formula] has a presentation by generators x,y±  1,z and relations yy- 1  =  1, y- 1y  =  1,

[formula]

The elements x,y±  1,z from Lemma [\ref=lem:equit] are called the equitable generators of [formula].

In the next two lemmas we display some isomorphisms that show how the equitable generators of [formula] are related to the Chevalley generators of [formula].

Pick [formula] and [formula]. Then there exists an [formula]-algebra isomorphism from the copy of [formula] given in Lemma [\ref=lem:equit], to the copy of [formula] given in Definition [\ref=def:chev], that sends

[formula]

The inverse of this isomorphism sends

[formula]

One checks that each map is an [formula]-algebra homomorphism, and that the maps are inverses. It follows that each map is an [formula]-algebra isomorphism.

Pick [formula] and [formula]. Then there exists an [formula]-algebra isomorphism from the copy of [formula] given in Lemma [\ref=lem:equit], to the copy of [formula] given in Definition [\ref=def:chev], that sends

[formula]

The inverse of this isomorphism sends

[formula]

Similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:Indent1].

Consider the copies of [formula] given in Definition [\ref=def:chev] and Lemma [\ref=lem:equit]. Pick [formula] and [formula]. Under the primary identification (resp. secondary identification) of type (θ,t) we identify these copies via the isomorphism given in Lemma [\ref=lem:Indent1] (resp. Lemma [\ref=lem:Indent2]).

The Casimir element Λ looks as follows from the equitable point of view.

Under every identification from Definition [\ref=def:xi], the Casimir element Λ is equal to each of the following:

[formula]

Consider the expression for Λ given in ([\ref=eq:lambda]). Write this expression in terms of x,y,z using any identification. Under a primary identification, Λ  =  qx + q- 1y + qz - qxyz. Under a secondary identification, Λ  =  q- 1x + qy + q- 1z - q- 1zyx. The six displayed expressions in the lemma statement are equal by [\cite=uawe]. The result follows.

Rearranging ([\ref=eq:r2]) we obtain

[formula]

(See [\cite=uawe].) The elements νx,νy,νz of [formula] are defined as follows:

[formula]

(See [\cite=equit].) The elements nx,ny,nz of [formula] are defined as follows:

[formula]

Pick [formula] and [formula]. Under the primary identification of type (θ,t),

[formula]

Under the secondary identification of type (θ,t),

[formula]

Use Definition [\ref=def:xi] and Definitions [\ref=def:nuxnuynuz], [\ref=def:nxnynz].

(See [\cite=uawe].) The [formula]-algebra [formula] is generated by νx,y±  1,νz and also by nx,y±  1,nz. Moreover

[formula]

(See [\cite=equit].) The following hold in [formula]:

[formula]

In [\cite=fduq] we described the finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-modules from the equitable point of view. Below we summarize a few points.

(See [\cite=fduq].) The [formula]-module [formula] has a basis {ui}di = 0 with respect to which the matrices representing x,y,z are:

[formula]

For each of x,y,z the action on [formula] is multiplicity-free, with eigenvalues {εqd - 2i  |  0  ≤  i  ≤  d}.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:uibasis].

(See [\cite=fduq].) Referring to Lemma [\ref=lem:uibasis], with respect to the basis {ui}di = 0 the matrices representing nx,nz are

[formula]

(See [\cite=fduq].) On the [formula]-module [formula], each of nrx, nry, nrz is nonzero for 0  ≤  r  ≤  d, and

[formula]

From the equitable point of view we now consider finite-dimensional [formula]-modules that are not necessarily irreducible.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then y acts on each weight space V(λ) as a scalar multiple of the identity. The scalar is qλ (under a primary identification) and q-  λ (under a secondary second identification).

By Definition [\ref=def:WS] and ([\ref=eq:th2]), ([\ref=eq:2th2]).

Each of nx,ny,nz is nilpotent on finite-dimensional [formula]-modules.

Suppose the result is false, and let the finite-dimensional [formula]-module V be a counterexample with minimal dimension. By construction [formula]. Also, V is not irreducible by Lemma [\ref=lem:nxnynzNIL] and the last assertion of Lemma [\ref=lem:irred]. Therefore V contains a [formula]-submodule W such that [formula]. Since the counterexample V has minimal dimension, each of nx,ny,nz is nilpotent on the [formula]-modules W and V / W. Consequently each of nx,ny,nz is nilpotent on V, for a contradiction. The result follows.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then for each of x,y,z the action on V is diagonalizable, with all eigenvalues among [formula].

By Definition [\ref=def:typeONE] and Lemma [\ref=lem:xyzMF].

By Lemma [\ref=lem:equit] the element y is invertible in [formula]. By [\cite=equit] the elements x,z are not invertible in [formula]. However by [\cite=equit] the elements x,z are invertible on nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules, provided that [formula]. We now show that x,z are invertible on nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules, without any assumption about [formula].

The elements x and z are invertible on nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules.

The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:nxNIL]. Suppose the result is false, and let the nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-module V be a counterexample with minimal dimension. Then V is not irreducible by Lemma [\ref=lem:xyzMF] and the last assertion of Lemma [\ref=lem:irred]. Therefore V contains a [formula]-submodule W such that [formula]. Since the counterexample V has minimal dimension, x and z are invertible on the [formula]-modules W and V / W. Consequently x and z are invertible on V, for a contradiction. The result follows.

We now describe the Lusztig automorphisms L and [formula] from the equitable point of view.

The following (i), (ii) hold for all [formula] and [formula].

Under the primary (resp. secondary) identification of type (θ,t) the automorphism L (resp. [formula]) sends

[formula]

and L- 1 (resp. [formula]) sends

[formula]

Under the primary (resp. secondary) identification of type (θ,t) the automorphism [formula] (resp. L) sends

[formula]

and [formula] (resp. L- 1) sends

[formula]

Use Definition [\ref=def:LusztigAut] and Lemmas [\ref=lem:Linv], [\ref=lem:efnxnz].

We point out two special cases of Proposition [\ref=prop:LusztigEquit].

The following (i), (ii) hold for all [formula] and [formula].

Assume that θ2  =  q. Under the primary (resp. secondary) identification of type (θ,t) the automorphism L (resp. [formula]) sends

[formula]

and L- 1 (resp. [formula]) sends

[formula]

Assume that θ2  =  q- 1. Under the primary (resp. secondary) identification of type (θ,t) the automorphism [formula] (resp. L) sends

[formula]

and [formula] (resp. L- 1) sends

[formula]

Shortly we will describe the Lusztig operators T and [formula] from the equitable point of view. In this description we will use the q-exponential function.

The q-exponential function

We will be discussing the elements nx,ny,nz of [formula] from Definition [\ref=def:nxnynz]. In this section we recall the q-exponential function, and investigate

[formula]

(See [\cite=tanisaki].) Let V denote a vector space over [formula] with finite positive dimension. Let φ∈End(V) be nilpotent. Define

[formula]

The following result is well known and readily verified.

(See [\cite=tanisaki].) Referring to Definition [\ref=def:expq], the map  expq(φ) is invertible; its inverse is

[formula]

We will make use of the following identity.

Referring to Definition [\ref=def:expq], we have

[formula]

To verify ([\ref=eq:ExpID]), express each side as a power series in φ using ([\ref=eq:EXP]), and for [formula] compare the coefficients of φi.

We now consider the objects ([\ref=eq:_expqnnn]). In view of Lemma [\ref=lem:nxNIL], we interpret these objects as operators that act on nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules. As we investigate these operators we will display some results for  expq(nz); similar results hold for  expq(nx) and  expq(ny).

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

expq(nz)- 1  Λ   expq(nz)  =  Λ;

expq(nz)- 1  nz   expq(nz)  =  nz.

(i) The element Λ commutes with nz by Lemma [\ref=lem:center]. Therefore Λ commutes with  expq(nz) in view of Definition [\ref=def:expq]. (ii) By Definition [\ref=def:expq].

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

[formula]

Setting φ = nz in Lemma [\ref=lem:expqForm], we obtain [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:znx] we have ynzy- 1  =  q2nz, so y   expq(nz)  y- 1  =   expq(q2nz). By Definitions [\ref=def:nuxnuynuz], [\ref=def:nxnynz] we have nz = q- 1(1 - yx)(q - q- 1)- 1, so yx = 1 - (q2 - 1)nz. By these comments y   expq(nz)  x  =   expq(nz). The result follows.

For an integer i  ≥  1,

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:lambda6] and Definition [\ref=def:nuxnuynuz] we obtain zνz  =  Λ - q- 1x  -  qy and νzz  =  Λ - qx  -  q- 1y. Also νz  =  (q - q- 1)nz by Definition [\ref=def:nxnynz]. By these comments znz  -  nzz  =  x - y. Use this, Lemma [\ref=lem:znx], and induction on i to obtain ([\ref=eq:znz]).

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

[formula]

To verify ([\ref=eq:yzToxz]), evaluate each side using Definition [\ref=def:expq] and simplify the result using Lemma [\ref=lem:rec].

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

[formula]

The left-hand side of ([\ref=eq:zNz]) is equal to

[formula]

which is equal to x + z - x- 1 by Lemmas [\ref=lem:yNz], [\ref=lem:yzToxz].

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

[formula]

In the equation  expq(nz)- 1  nz   expq(nz)  =  nz, use nz  =  q(1 - xy)(q - q- 1)- 1 to obtain  expq(nz)- 1  (1 - xy)   expq(nz)  =  1 - xy. Evaluate this equation using Lemma [\ref=lem:yNz] to get the result.

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

[formula]

To verify ([\ref=eq:nxNz]), eliminate nx,ny using

[formula]

and evaluate the result using Lemmas [\ref=lem:yNz], [\ref=lem:zNz].

On nonzero finite-dimensional [formula]-modules,

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:lambda6] and Definition [\ref=def:nuxnuynuz] we obtain νyy  =  Λ  -  qz - q- 1x. In this equation, multiply each side on the left and right by  expq(nz)- 1 and  expq(nz), respectively, and evaluate the result using Definitions [\ref=def:nuxnuynuz], [\ref=def:nxnynz] and Lemmas [\ref=lem:yNz], [\ref=lem:zNz], [\ref=lem:xNz].

Rotators

In this section we discuss the rotators for a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. We comment on the history. In [\cite=equit] a rotator was constructed using the q-exponential function. In [\cite=fduq] we found the matrices that represent this rotator with respect to various bases for the underlying vector space. In [\cite=lrt] we investigated the rotator concept in a more general setting. In the present section we will follow [\cite=equit] more or less, adopting a different point of view, and giving new proofs that we find more illuminating.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. By a rotator on V we mean an invertible R∈End(V) such that on V,

[formula]

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then there exists a rotator on V.

By Definition [\ref=def:typeONE] we may assume that the [formula]-module V is irreducible. Define x',y',z' in End(V) as follows:

The map y' is invertible by Lemma [\ref=lem:xyzinv]. The maps x',y',z' satisfy the defining relations for [formula]; therefore V becomes a [formula]-module such that

The new [formula]-module V is irreducible by construction, and type 1 by Lemma [\ref=lem:xyzMF]. Therefore the new [formula]-module V is isomorphic to the original [formula]-module V. Let R∈End(V) denote an isomorphism of [formula]-modules from the new [formula]-module V to the original [formula]-module V. By construction R is invertible and satisfies ([\ref=eq:ROT]). Therefore R is a rotator on V.

Later in the paper we will construct an operator that acts as a rotator on the finite-dimensional [formula]-modules of type 1. For the time being, we focus on the irreducible case.

Let R denote a rotator on the irreducible [formula]-module [formula]. Then for R'∈End(V) the following are equivalent:

R' is a rotator on V;

there exists [formula] such that R' = αR.

(i)  ⇒  (ii) The composition R'R- 1 commutes with the actions x,y,z on V. By this and Lemma [\ref=lem:uibasis], there exists [formula] such that R'R- 1  =  αI. Consequently R' = αR. (ii)  ⇒  (i) Clear.

Consider the irreducible [formula]-module [formula]. Define X,Y,Z in End(V) as follows. By Lemma [\ref=lem:xyzMF], each of x,y,z is multiplicity-free on V with eigenvalues {qd - 2i  |  0  ≤  i  ≤  d}. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  d, X (resp. Y) (resp. Z) acts on the (qd - 2i)-eigenspace of x (resp. y) (resp. z) as q2i(d - i) times the identity. By construction X,Y,Z are invertible.

We have some comments about Definition [\ref=def:XYZ]. Since the scalars {qd - 2i}di = 0 are mutually distinct, there exists a polynomial G = Gd in one variable, that has all coefficients in [formula] and degree at most d, such that

[formula]

In the above line, replace i by d - i to obtain

The maps τx,τy,τz and the Lusztig operators [formula]

Let V denote a finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-module of type 1, with standard rotator Ω. In this section we use Ω to define three elements in End(V), denoted τx,τy,τz. We discuss how τx,τy,τz are related to the maps X,Y,Z from Definition [\ref=def:XYZ]. We then show how τy is related to the Lusztig operators T and [formula].

Consider the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:Yty]). We have Y   expq(nz)  =   expq(nz)  X by Lemma [\ref=lem:nzXY], and Ω   expq(nz)  =   expq(ny)  Ω by ([\ref=eq:OmExp2]). Also  expq(nz)  X   expq(ny)  =  Ω by Lemma [\ref=lem:Om3]. By these comments, the right-hand side of ([\ref=eq:Yty]) is equal to Ω3. The result follows.

Recall the primary and secondary identifications from Definition [\ref=def:xi].

Let V denote a finite-dimensional irreducible [formula]-module of type 1. Under any identification, τyV(λ)  =  V( - λ) for all [formula].

Use Lemma [\ref=lem:yactionIdent] and Lemma [\ref=prop:tauConj](ii).

Pick [formula] and [formula].

Assume that θ2 = q. Under the primary identification of type (θ,t) the following holds on the [formula]-module [formula]:

[formula]

Assume that θ2 = q. Under the secondary identification of type (θ,t) the following holds on the [formula]-module [formula]:

[formula]

(i) We show that ([\ref=eq:tauT]) holds on V. Pick [formula] and consider the corresponding summand in ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]). We now write this summand in terms of e,f,k. Using the primary identification of type (θ,t) in Lemma [\ref=lem:efnxnz], along with ke = q2ek and kf = q- 2fk, we obtain

[formula]

Observe that on V(λ),

[formula]

By the above comments, for a,b,c the corresponding summand in ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]) acts on V(λ) as a scalar multiple of faebfc. By Lemma [\ref=lem:efmove] we have faebfcV(λ)  ⊆  V(μ), where λ  -  μ  =  2(a - b + c). Note that μ =  - λ if and only if a - b + c = λ. By this and Lemma [\ref=lem:tauAction], the equation ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]) remains valid if we restrict the sum to those [formula] such that a - b + c = λ. Evaluating ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]) using the above discussion we find that on V(λ),

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:compare]) and Lemma [\ref=lem:TTcheckInv], we find that τy  =  ( - 1)dθd2T- 1 on V(λ). Since V is spanned by its weight spaces, τy  =  ( - 1)dθd2T- 1 on V. (ii) We show that ([\ref=eq:tauTvee]) holds on V. Recall that τy acts on each weight space V(λ) as in ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]). Pick [formula] and consider the corresponding summand in ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]). We now write this summand in terms of e,f,k. Using the secondary identification of type (θ,t) in Lemma [\ref=lem:efnxnz], along with ke = q2ek and kf = q- 2fk, we obtain

[formula]

On V(λ),

[formula]

This time around, ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]) remains valid if we restrict the sum to those [formula] such that b - a - c = λ. Evaluating ([\ref=eq:tauExpand2]) using these comments we find that on V(λ),

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq:compare2]) and Lemma [\ref=lem:TTcheckInv], we find that [formula] on V(λ). Since V is spanned by its weight spaces, [formula] on V. (iii) Proceeding as in the proof of (i) above, we find that on each weight space V(λ),

[formula]

Evaluate ([\ref=eq:tau3]) using Lemmas [\ref=lem:TTcheckInv], [\ref=lem:TTcomp]. (iv) Proceeding as in the proof of (ii) above, we find that on each weight space V(λ),

[formula]

Evaluate ([\ref=eq:tau4]) using Lemmas [\ref=lem:TTcheckInv], [\ref=lem:TTcomp].

The rotator [formula] and the Lusztig operators [formula]

In this section we introduce an operator [formula] that acts as a rotator on each finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. We show how [formula] is related to the Lusztig operators T, [formula].

Until the end of this section, the following notation and assumptions are in effect. Assume that [formula] contains the square root of q. Pick [formula] such that θ2  =  q or θ2  =  q- 1. Pick [formula]. Assume the primary or secondary identification of type (θ,t), as in Definition [\ref=def:xi]. Define

[formula]

For [formula],

[formula]

The integers d and d2 have the same parity, so ( - 1)d  =  ( - 1)d2. The result follows from this and ([\ref=eq:Sqrtq]).

Next we define an operator Υ, that acts on each type 1 finite-dimensional [formula]-module in an [formula]-linear fashion. We now give the action.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then Υ acts on each weight space V(λ) as a scalar multiple of the identity. The scalar is q-  λ2 / 2, where q1 / 2 is from ([\ref=eq:Sqrtq]).

We have two comments about Υ.

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then each [formula]-submodule of V is Υ-invariant.

Let W denote the [formula]-submodule in question. By Lemmas [\ref=lem:typeOneSub], [\ref=lem:dsws] we see that W is spanned by eigenvectors for k. By Definition [\ref=def:Psidef], these vectors are eigenvectors for Υ. Therefore W is Υ-invariant.

On the [formula]-module [formula],

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:Ymeaning] and Definition [\ref=def:Psidef].

We now define an operator [formula] that acts on each type 1 finite-dimensional [formula]-module in an [formula]-linear fashion.

[formula]

where Υ is from Definition [\ref=def:Psidef].

On the [formula]-module [formula],

[formula]

where q1 / 2 is from ([\ref=eq:Sqrtq]).

Compare ([\ref=eq:OmDef]) and ([\ref=eq:tOmDef]) using Lemma [\ref=lem:PsiVSY].

Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. Then each [formula]-submodule of V is [formula]-invariant.

Let W denote the [formula]-submodule in question. By assumption W is invariant under nx and nz. Therefore W is invariant under  expq(nx) and  expq(nz). By Lemma [\ref=lem:WPsiInv], W is invariant under Υ. By these comments and Definition [\ref=def:tOmDef], W is invariant under [formula].

The operator [formula] acts as a rotator on each finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1.

Let V denote the [formula]-module in question. By Definition [\ref=def:typeONE], V is a direct sum of irreducible [formula]-submodules that have type 1. Each summand W is [formula]-invariant by Lemma [\ref=lem:WRinv]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:OmVStildeOm], [formula] acts on W as a scalar multiple of Ω. Now by Lemma [\ref=lem:RotUnique] and Proposition [\ref=prop:OmExists], [formula] acts on W as a rotator. Consequently [formula] acts on V as a rotator.

Recall from Definition [\ref=def:xi] the primary and secondary identification of type (θ,t).

The rotator [formula] is related to the Lusztig operators [formula] according to the table below:

First assume θ2 = q and the primary identification of type (θ,t). Let V denote a finite-dimensional [formula]-module of type 1. We show that [formula] on V. By Definition [\ref=def:typeONE] and Lemma [\ref=lem:WRinv], we may assume without loss that the [formula]-module V is irreducible. Let d denote the diameter of V. On V,

[formula]

For the other cases the proof is similar.
