Introduction

Recently, an effort has been made to give a unified description of small and large amplitude collective motion within the microscopic time-dependent energy density functional (TD-EDF) theory. The inclusion of pairing effects in nuclear dynamic has opened new perspectives for the description of giant resonances [\cite=Sca13b] [\cite=Sca14] or direct reactions like nucleon transfer [\cite=Sca13a]. Quite recently, the possibility to get physical insight on the fission process using microscopic transport models has been revisited including pairing [\cite=Sca15] [\cite=Tan15] or not [\cite=Sim14] [\cite=God14].

In the present article, some aspects of fission are discussed using the recently developed TD-BCS model.

Fission dynamic with TD-BCS

The TD-BCS approach is a microscopic method that solve the evolution of quasi-particle states in their self-consistent mean-field and pairing field. Technical aspects related to the TD-BCS we are using are extensively described in Refs [\cite=Sca13a] [\cite=Eba10] [\cite=Sca12]. Some great advantages of this approach is that (i) it allows to treat nuclear dynamics from small to large amplitude collective motion (ii) it does not pre-select a priori specific collective degrees of freedom (DOFs). As a matter of fact, any collective DOF can play an important role as soon as it can acquire non-zero value consistently with the symmetries of the initial condition. (iii) it does not presuppose that the collective motion is adiabatic or not. In the context of fission, it is still quite useful to first consider the adiabatic energy landscape as a function of some collective DOFs, like elongation, multipole moments, ...

An illustration is given in Fig. [\ref=fig:pes] for the case of 258Fm fission. This curve is obtained here using the static version of TD-EDF with various constraint on the quadrupole moment. In the limit of very slow fission, it is expected that the dynamics directly reflects the motion along the adiabatic path. However, starting from one of the point in the curve, there is no reason that the TD-EDF evolution follows this energy landscape. Indeed, the motion can eventually be rather fast especially close to the scission point where the slope of the energy landscape change abruptly. The motion can be more complex than a collective motion in one dimension due to the possibility to excite other DOFs. The departure from adiabatic motion can directly be observed in the evolution of the nucleus density in TD-EDF (see Fig. [\ref=fig:movie]). We see in this figure, that the two nuclei after scission can exhibit large octupole deformation. Such deformations are not observed along the adiabatic path.

Collective aspects of mean-field dynamic

To further study some aspects of fission with TD-EDF and make connection with macroscopic models it is highly desirable to be able to define collective masses and momenta associated with a set of degrees of freedom. A method has been proposed in Ref. [\cite=Tan15]. In general, the collective variable under interest [formula] is known explicitly (multipole moments, relative distance, mass asymmetry, neck, ...). Less easy is the knowledge of the associated collective momentum P̂ and associated mass M. Several methods based on adiabatic approximation are usually used to construct these quantities. Here, we directly deduce them from TD-EDF evolutions.

Assuming that the collective variable is local, and that the conjugated variables should fulfill the two conditions:

[formula]

and

[formula]

It was possible to prove that the collective momentum can be written as

[formula]

Here, the collective mass M is given by:

[formula]

This expression of the mass is sometimes also obtained in other approaches that specifically assume adiabatic or diabatic motion. The great difference stems from the fact that here the density ρ(t) entering in it is the TD-EDF one. Therefore, it can contain non-adiabatic effects as well as possible influence of other collective and non-collective DOFs. An illustration of the quadrupole collective mass obtained with the TD-EDF method is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:mass]. For comparison, the mass obtained assuming that the density identifies with the density along the adiabatic path is shown. While at initial instants, the system follows the adiabatic limit, when it approaches the scission, the collective motion accelerate and clear deviation from adiabaticity is observed.

Dissipated energy along the fission path

The possibility to access collective momentum is useful to get information on the energy balance during fission. In particular, it can give access to some dissipative aspects. We show in Fig. [\ref=fig:diss] examples of evolution of the quadrupole momentum for different initial conditions taken for initial values of Q2 lower or greater than the scission point Qsc2. The most important feature is that, for Q2  ≤  Qsc2, all curves seem to become identical before reaching scission. This could only be understood assuming that the system is strongly damped at the early instant of its dynamical evolution and rapidly end up along the same dynamical path. It is worth mentioning that this path does not necessarily match with the one displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:pes].

Starting from this finding, and from the knowledge of the collective momentum. It was possible to extract the total energy dissipated along the fission path [\cite=Tan15]. It was shown that this dissipated energy is quite large and can approach 10 % of the final total kinetic energy TKE of the daughter nuclei after fission. The TKE obtained in the symmetric compact fission of 258Fm is shown in bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:pes] and is close to 200 MeV. Therefore, around 20 MeV of the initial energy is dissipated during the fission. In the present calculation, this energy is transferred to other internal DOFs of the two fissioning nuclei and can eventually lead to particle evaporation.

Summary

In the present article, we have illustrated the fission of a superfluid nucleus using the TD-BCS approach. A method is used to get macroscopic information, like collective momentum and mass from the microscopic evolution. In particular, it is shown that the collective mass deviates from the adiabatic limit, especially close to the scission point where the evolution is faster. The sharing of the initial energy between total kinetic energy of final fragments and internal excitations is also studied. It is seen that almost 10 % of the TKE was dissipated. This dissipation occurs at the very first instants of the dynamical evolution.
