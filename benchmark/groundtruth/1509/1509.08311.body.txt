The D code

D  is a software package developed in C++11 and structured in classes in order to be as much flexible and configurable as possible [\cite=Corsaro14]. It implements a more recent version of the NSMC algorithm [\cite=Skilling04] [\cite=Shaw07] [\cite=Feroz08] [\cite=Feroz09]. The user can supply its own likelihoods, priors and models, according to the astrophysical problem of interest, by using a starting template. All the free parameters of the model and its corresponding Bayesian Evidence are therefore estimated by the code.

Peak Bagging and Bayesian model comparison

Determining how many different background signals are observed in the stars' power spectrum (Fig. [\ref=fig:bkg], left) can be done by means of a model comparison based on the Bayesian Evidence, where each competing model includes a different representation of the background level. With the same method, one can also test the significance of an oscillation peak, in which the competing models will either include or not the peak to be assessed (Fig. [\ref=fig:bkg], right). Model comparison becomes this way a very straightforward task [\cite=Corsaro14].

The novel approach: Multi-modality

Conversely to other existing sampling methods (e.g. based on Markov Chain algorithm [\cite=Handberg11]) D  allows to sample highly multi-modal distributions very efficiently [\cite=Corsaro14]. The Eggbox function (Fig. [\ref=fig:eggbox]) is an example of degenerate (multiple) solution, namely a posterior probability distribution with several modes (hence multi-modal), sampled by D. We exploited the multi-modality as a novel approach to the peak bagging, succeeding in reducing the number of free parameters used to fit 27 consecutive oscillation peaks from 81 (a Lorentzian profile for each peak, hence 3 free parameters) to only 9 free parameters in total. The approach is very fast and efficient and is very well suited for automatizing the peak bagging analysis for future applications to several oscillating main sequence stars.
