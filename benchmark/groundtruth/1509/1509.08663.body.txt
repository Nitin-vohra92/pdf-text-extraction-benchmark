Introduction

Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are mass-exchange binaries that contain an accreting black hole or neutron star primary and a low-mass secondary star. Accretion takes place through an accretion disc which encircles the compact object and regulates the flow of material onto it making these objects the brightest X-ray sources in the sky. LMXBs provide an ideal playground for exploring the physics of compact objects yielding the confirmation of the existence of stellar mass black holes. Optical observations are crucial to prove this. By observing the radial velocity curve of the companion star, one can determine the mass function of the system, which represents a minimum mass for the accreting compact object. This experiment can be best applied to a subclass of LMXBs, the so called X-ray Transients (XTs), in which X-ray activity occurs only during well-defined outburst episodes. Between outbursts, the emission from the accretion flow fades to the point that the companion star is clearly visible and it is nearly undisturbed by irradiation; hence it can be used to derive a dynamical mass for the compact object [\citep=charles06].

The distribution of black hole masses can only be determined from the study of X-ray binaries [\citep=casares07] and it is intricately related to the population and evolution of massive stars, the energetics and dynamics of supernova explosions, and the critical mass dividing neutron stars and black holes. Several attempts to extract statistical information from the observed mass distribution have been made [\citep=bailyn98] [\citep=ozel10] [\citep=farr11] [\citep=kreidberg12], however, the small number of black holes prevents us from extracting very compelling conclusions. About ~  108-109 stellar-mass black holes are believed to exist in the Galaxy [\citep=brown94] while ~  103-104 are expected to be members of XTs [\citep=white96] [\citep=romani98] [\citep=yungelson06]. Unfortunately only ~  20 black hole candidates have reliable dynamical mass determinations to date. In summary, it becomes necessary to increase the sample of black hole masses.

The best place to look for black holes are XTs, which are detected in outburst by X-ray all-sky monitors. This was the case of KY TrA, a historical X-ray transient discovered in 1974 by the Ariel V instruments [\citep=pounds74]. After a short precursor, KY TrA reached an outburst peak flux of 0.9 Crab in the 3-6 keV band, before decaying with an e-folding time of about 2 months [\citep=kaluziensky75]. The source also showed a low intensity outburst in 1990 which was significantly fainter than the discovery 1974 outburst [\citep=barret95]. Six months later, an upper limit to the quiescent X-ray luminosity of ~  2-10×  1033erg s- 1 was derived. The ultrasoft X-ray spectrum seen by Ariel V and the hard tail observed by SIGMA [\citep=barret92] strongly suggests that KY TrA is a black hole candidate. The optical counterpart was identified 12 days after the X-ray maximum of the 1974 outburst at B=17.5 [\citep=murdin77]. Surprisingly, no further optical studies have been done since.

In this paper we present an optical study of the counterpart of the X-ray Transient KY TrA in quiescence to test its identification and obtain information about the donor star.

Observations

Photometry

The field of KY TrA was observed on UT 2004 May 16 with the ESO VLT U4 telescope at Paranal and the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2). Seven 300 s exposures were obtained in Johnson I , spinning over 0.6 hours. We also obtained series of 600 s images in I on UT 2007 Jun 16 and 17 on the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, equipped with the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC). In the first night of this run the sky was partially covered by clouds and no calibrations or images in other filters than I were obtained. Fortunately weather improved on Jun 17 and we could take also V and R images of KY TrA with 1500 s and 1000 s respectively. Furthermore R, I and Hα images were taken on UT 2010 June 03 on the ESO VLT U1 telescope at Paranal and FORS2 using 80 s, 45 s and 400 s integration respectively in each band.

For calibration, we observed the field of KY TrA on UT 2015 Jan 18 with the 1.3 m SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo (Chile). We took V, R and I images with, respectively, 800, 500 and 500 seconds of exposure time. We observed also the Landolt field SA107 with 30 seconds integration in each of the three bands. An observing log is presented in Table 1.

All images were corrected for bias and flat-fielded in the standard way using IRAF. In particular the 2007 I-band frames were affected by fringing so these images were corrected using a master flat, i.e. the result of the median of a set of dithered exposures of our field. Point spread function PSF photometry was obtained with DAOPHOT II [\citep=stetson87] whereas differential photometry of the 2004 and 2007 series were performed creating a photometric reference level, through an ensemble of isolated stars in the KY TrA field, following the technique described in [\citet=honeycutt92].

We finally calibrated a set of stars in the 2015 field that we then used as secondary standards to calibrate the 2004 and 2007 images, taken under non photometric conditions. To do so, we used the observatory extinction coefficients together with the zero points extracted from the Landolt standards.

Spectroscopy

A single 2000 s spectrum was obtained on the night of 2004 May 16 using FORS2 at the ESO VLT U4 telescope at Paranal. We used the GRIS-600RI grism, and a 2×  2 binning in both the spatial and spectral direction, which provides a wavelength coverage of λλ5200-8400 at 1.68 Å pix- 1 dispersion and 600 km s- 1 resolution. Standard procedures were used to de-bias and flat-field the spectra. The one-dimensional spectra were extracted using optimal extraction routines which maximize the final signal-to-noise ratio. A Hg-Cd-Ar-Ne arc was obtained to provide the wavelength calibration scale.

Astrometry of KY TrA

The optical counterpart of KY TrA was identified at α=15:28:16.59 and δ=-61:52:58.1 (2000) by [\citet=murdin77] 12 days after the outburst. These authors showed a Schmidt plate of the proposed counterpart but no deep image with the target in quiescence has been published to date. In Figure [\ref=figure:field] we show an improved finding chart of KY TrA (I-band, 1800 s exposure and 0[formula]9 seeing, taken on 2007 June 17). The field is 2x2 arcmin and the star at the position proposed by [\citet=murdin77] is marked in the center. For comparison we have also marked the star labeled as 'S' in that paper. In this figure we also show a zoom of the central region of 30x30 arcsecs where an elongation of the source profile along the NW direction is clearly visible. We measure an elongation coefficient (the IRAF "ellipsoidal" parameter) of 0.68, significantly larger than the typical values obtained for nearby field stars (0.32). Although this requires confirmation through better seeing quality images, it strongly suggests that the counterpart is double and the transient is blended with an interloper.

To obtain a precise astrometric solution, we used the positions of the astrometric standards selected from the USNO-B1 astrometric catalog with a nominal 0[formula]2 uncertainty. Hundreds of reference objects can be identified in our field from which we selected 392, discarding the stars with significant proper motions. The IRAF tasks ccmap/cctran were applied for the astrometric transformation of the images. Formal rms uncertainties of the astrometric fit for our images are [formula]0[formula]25 in both right ascension and declination, which is compatible with the maximum catalog position uncertainty of the selected standards. The star within the [\citet=murdin77] error box has coordinates α=15:28:16.97 and δ=-61:52:58.2 with a conservative estimate of our 3σ astrometric uncertainty of [formula]0 [formula]3 in both RA and Dec.

We test this identification by cross-matching the R, I, and Hα photometry of the field of KY TrA taken on 2010 to build the (R-I)-(R-Hα) diagram of all the objects detected in the three photometric bands. Our proposed target (marked with a circle in Figure [\ref=figure:diagram]) shows a clear Hα excess above the main stellar locus, confirming it is the true quiescent counterpart of KY TrA. Note that very close to the KT TrA counterpart there is another source of similar colour and Hα excess. This source is at 58 arcsec from the XT and its nature is unknown. However, KY TrA should be located even higher in this diagram since the presence of the interloper dilutes its actual Hα excess.

We can refine the location of the counterpart by choosing which of the components of the blend is actually the XT counterpart. To do so, we first aligned the R, I, and Hα images and then calculated the centroids of the profile targeted as KY TrA and of a set of 40 stars around it. In Figure [\ref=figure:centroids] (bottom) we show the modulus of the shifts between R, I and Hα, defined as (1 / 2) and (1 / 2) where (x,y) are the positions of the centroids in pixels. The centroid of KY TrA measured in Hα is clearly shifted with respect to its position in the R and I images. The top panel in Figure [\ref=figure:centroids] shows a zoom of the Hα image centered on our target, with the white cross marking its centroid and the black cross the centroid measured in the I-band image. This indicates that the XT is the component of the blend located at the NW. Assuming that the Hα centroid is the actual position of the target, we derived an improved source position of α=15:28:16.97 and δ=-61:52:57.8 with an uncertainty of [formula]0 [formula]3 in both RA and Dec.

Photometry

The colours of KY TrA

The colours of KY TrA in quiescence were obtained on UT 2007 June 17. We calculated I=20.88±  0.01, R=21.75±  0.01 and V=22.83±  0.12. Photometric error estimates on the magnitudes are based on a combination of Poisson statistics and the error contribution of the stars used for calibration. These magnitudes, however, correspond to the transient blended with the interloper (see section [\ref=astrometry]) so they need to be corrected taking this into account. To do so, we cleaned the contribution of the contaminant component by subtracting its best PSF fit. The initial centers for fitting the profiles of the components were determined by visual inspection of the I image, where they are more clear. The two components of the blend have approximately equal brightness: we calculated I=21.47±  0.09, R=22.3±  0.1 and V= 23.6±  0.1 for the top component, which is the XT counterpart as suggested by the Hα image. The (V - R) and (V - I) colours are typical of a M0 star, although note that this is not corrected for interstellar reddening. [\citet=murdin77] report a reddening E(B-V)≥  0.5. An estimation of the interstellar reddening for any sky region can be obtained from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/. The reddening quoted for the field of KY TrA, E(B-V)=0.7, implies a corrected (V - R)0=0.77 and (V - I)0=1.15 consistent with a ~  K0-2V companion. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this is likely an upper limit to the true spectral type of the donor star because we have neglected any contribution from a residual accretion disc into the observed colour.

Searching for variability

The limited seeing conditions prevents us from deblending the flux of the two stars in every single image. Therefore, we studied the variability of KY TrA by integrating the total flux of the blend from the series of images in the I-band in the two different epochs: in 2004 May with less than one hour of observations and in 2007 June 16 and 17 with about 6 hours coverage. The 2004 images were obtained during twilight so photometry accuracy was dominated by a bright sky level. Unfortunately on 2007 June 16 we were affected by poor weather conditions with variable transparency caused by clouds. On 2007 June 17 no clouds were present although sky transparency was not ideal. In this night we get ~  7% photometry for a 21.5 magnitude star. In summary, we found that the target is not variable above the error levels in any of our nights (i.e., σ=0.07, 0.14 and 0.07 mags for 2004 May and 2007 June 16 and 17 respectively). This is clearly seen in Fig.[\ref=figure:variability] where we plot the scatter in the observed magnitudes. The scatter around the mean magnitude of KY TrA (marked with a circle in Fig.[\ref=figure:variability]) is consistent with that displayed by the field stars of similar mean brightness. Note that the presence of the interloper dilutes the orbital modulation of KY TrA, which would explain the lack of photometric variability on our images. Because the interloper contributes around half of the total flux, we can only conclude that the target is not variable by >  0.15 mags.

After re-scaling the zero-point of each night we found that the total flux remains stable at I=20.88±  0.01 (I=21.47±  0.09 for KY TrA, i.e. the top component of the blend) in our entire dataset, from 2004 until 2007.

Spectroscopy

Although very noisy, our spectrum shows the Hα emission line characteristic of X-ray transients in quiescence. We obtained its full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) from a Gaussian fit of the continuum rectified spectrum within the range ±  10000 km/s, centered on the Hα line. This is shown in Fig. [\ref=figure:Ha_gaussian]. After subtracting quadratically the instrumental resolution we find FWHM=2700±  280 km/s where the error is the formal 1-σ on the fitted parameter as derived through χ2 minimization. We note that the quoted error is within the typical 10% standard deviation caused by intrinsic line variability and therefore we take this as realistic [\citep=casares15]. We also extracted the equivalent width (EW) by integrating the Hα flux after continuum normalization and find [formula]Å. Note, however, that this value is diluted by the extra continuum of the interloper and hence the true EW of KY TrA is underestimated by a factor  2.

Discussion

Although KY TrA is a very promising black hole candidate, it had not been studied in the optical band since its discovery in 1974. We have observed KY TrA in quiescence and confirmed its identification. The finding chart we present will certainly be helpful in performing observations with eELT-class telescopes in order to obtain dynamical information on the mass of the compact object.

A rough estimate of the period can be made by combining the [\citet=paczynski71] expression for the averaged radius of a Roche lobe with Kepler's Third Law to get the well-known relationship between the secondary's mean density and the orbital period: ρ = (110 / P2h) g cm- 3, where ρ is the mean density and Ph the orbital period in hours. Under the hypothesis that the light of KY TrA is contaminated by the interloper, we calculate an orbital period of about 8 h assuming a K0V star. It should be noted that this is likely an upper limit since, as we pointed out in Sect. 4.1, we have neglected any residual contribution from an accretion disc to the colour of KY TrA. An independent estimation can be made using the empirical relation Δ  V = 14.36 - 7.63   log   Ph which predicts the orbital period of XTs with orbital periods less than 1 day given only its visual outburst amplitude Δ  V [\citep=shahbaz98]. During outburst, optical emission is dominated by the reprocessing of the X-rays in the accretion disc where most of the reprocessed energy is radiated in the ultraviolet. According to the irradiated model predictions (B - V)disc  ~  0 [\citep=vanparadijs95] resulting in V  ~  17.5 at the outburst peak [\citep=murdin77]. Taking V=23.6 in quiescence, the total outburst amplitude is ~  6.1 mag so this would lead to an orbital period of about 12 hours. We can place a robust upper limit for the period of about 15 h corresponding to a minimum outburst amplitude if the source were not contaminated by any interloper.

After analyzing the Hα emission profiles of 12 dynamically confirmed black holes and 2 neutron star X-ray transients (XTs) in quiescence, [\citet=casares15] has found a tight correlation between the FWHM of the Hα line and the velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star, where K2=0.233(13)×  FWHM. We have applied this relation to KY TrA and predict K2=630±  74 km/s. This can be combined with our rough estimates of the orbital period to infer the mass function f(M) of the binary. Our upper limit P < 15 h implies f(M) < 16 M[formula] while [formula] h would lead to [formula] M[formula]. More accurate constraints require an accurate determination of the orbital period.

Despite the foregoing, no variability has been found above the error levels, i.e. ~  0.07 mags, indicating that we may be looking at the binary at very low inclination. However, given the contaminating flux from an interloper, the variability would be diluted to the extent that any intrinsic variability above ~  0.15 mag would not be detectable given our error levels, and so the inclination might not be as low. Interestingly, KY TrA has one of the broadest Hα lines among SXTs (a summary of the parameters of the XTs can be found in [\citet=casares15] Table 3), suggesting that, if KY TrA is viewed at low inclination, it must have a very short orbital period. Some clues about the inclination are provided by the EW of the Hα line, since it depends on the binary geometry. The EW tends to increase with inclination because, when the disc is seen at large inclinations, its continuum brightness decreases. An interesting exercise is to locate KY TrA in the EW-FWHM diagram shown in figure 5 of [\citet=casares15]. Regions of constant inclination and M1 / P, where M1 is the mass of the compact object and P is the orbital period, are defined in the diagram. Both the relatively large EW and the high M1 / P factor are reminiscent of XTE J1118+480 and suggest that KY TrA also hosts a black hole seen at moderately high inclination. Furthermore, we point out that given the contaminating flux from an interloper, the observed EW would just be a lower limit to the true EW since the latter would be diluted by the excess continuum. Clearly, more higher quality photometry is necessary to resolve these issues and draw further firm conclusions.
