Quasi-normality and Shared Functions

1114

Introduction

Inspired by the heuristic principle, attributed to Bloch, Schwick [\cite=Sch_92] discovered a connection between normality and shared values. Since then many researchers have given various sufficient conditions of normality using shared values. But a less number of articles are there in support of quasi-normal family. In our best knowledge there are a few results connecting quasi-normality and shared values. In this article we prove a quasi-normality criterion concerning shared functions. In 1975, Zalcman [\cite=Zalc_1] proved a remarkable result, now known as Zalcman's Lemma, for families of meromorphic functions which are not normal in a domain. Roughly speaking, it says that a non-normal family can be rescaled at small scale to obtain a non-constant meromorphic function in the limit. This result of Zalcman gave birth to many new normality criteria.

Recently, Datt and Kumar proved a normality criterion for a family of holomorphic functions in a domain concerning shared holomorphic functions.

Let F be a family of holomorphic functions on a domain D such that all zeros of f∈F are of multiplicity at least k, where k is a positive integer. Let a,b be holomorphic functions in D. If for each f∈F,

[formula]

a(z)  ≠  b(z),

[formula]

[formula],

where [formula]. Then F is normal in D.

We prove a quasi-normality criterion related to the theorem of Datt and Kumar (cf. Theorem [\ref=qthm]).

Basic Notions and Main Results

The notion of quasi-normal families was introduced by Montel in 1922 [\cite=Montel_22]. The concept of quasi-normality is not studied as much as the concept of normal families. Let us recall the definition of quasi-normal family.

A family F of meromorphic (analytic) functions on a domain D is called quasi-normal on D if every sequence {fn} of functions in F has a subsequence which converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula] with respect to the spherical (Euclidean) metric, where the set E has no accumulation points in D. If the set [formula] we say F is normal on D.

If the set E can always be taken to satisfy |E|  ≤  q then we say F is quasi-normal of order q in D. F fails to be quasi-normal of order q in D when there exists a set E such that |E|  ≥  q + 1. Thus a family F is normal in D if and only if it is quasi-normal of order 0 in D.

Let [formula]. This family is not normal in any domain of [formula] which contains 0. Also, for each domain in [formula] this family is normal.Therefore, F is a quasi-normal family of order 1 in any domain which contains 0.

This notion was further extended by Chuang in an inductive fashion as Qm  -  normality [\cite=Chuang_93]. He used the concept of m - th order derived set to define Qm  -  normality.

Let D be a plane domain and E  ⊂  D. Then the set of all accumulation points of F in D is called the derived set of order 1 in D and denoted by E(1)D. For every m  ≥  2, the m - th order derived set E(m)D is defined by [formula].

A family F of meromorphic (holomorphic) functions on a domain D is Qm  -  normal ([formula]) if each sequence {fn} of functions in F has a subsequence which converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula] with respect to the spherical (Euclidean) metric, where the set E satisfies [formula]

It follows from the definition that a Q0  -  normal family is a normal family and a Q1  -  normal family is a quasi-normal family. If the set E can always be taken to satisfy |E(m)D|  ≤  q then we say F is Qm  -  normal of order q in D. This notion of Qm  -  normality was further studied by Nevo [\cite=Nevo_01] [\cite=Nevo_05].

The theory of normal families is much studied by shared values and functions. This is not the case with quasi-normlaity. To the best of our knowledge there is only one result on quasi-normality and shared values due to Nevo [\cite=Nevo_05], which is as follows.

Let F be a family of functions meromorphic on a domain D. Let q  ≥  1 be an integer and a, b be two distinct complex numbers. Assume that for any f∈F there exist points [formula] belonging to D such that f and f' share a and b in [formula]. Then F is a quasi-normal family of order at most q in D.

It is natural to ask whether we can give a quasi-normality criterion concerning shared functions. Here we propose a quasi-normality criterion for a family of holomorphic functions which extends Theorem [\ref=Nevo_05] in some extent. We replace values a,b by holomorphic functions a(z),b(z) respectively and f' by a linear differential polynomial [formula], where [formula] are holomorphic functions, with [formula]. We define

[formula]

We propose the following result:

Let F be a family of holomorphic functions on a domain D such that all zeros of f∈F are of multiplicity at least k, where k is a positive integer. Let a, b be holomorphic functions in D such that

[formula]

a(z)  ≠  b(z)

If for each f∈F there exist points [formula] in D such that for all [formula]

[formula]

[formula].

Then F is a quasi-normal family of order at most q in D.

Let {fn} be a sequence in F. Without loss of generality we assume that Nfn = N, 0  ≤  N  ≤  q. If N = 0, then F is normal and hence quasi-normal of order 0, by Theorem [\ref=Ind_J_PAM_1]. For N  ≥  1, we have for each n, fn and Lk(fn) share a(z) and [formula] in the domain [formula] We also assume that as k  →    ∞  , [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  N.

Now, we claim that {fn} converges compactly on [formula] Take a point [formula] and r > 0 such that [formula] For large values of n we have [formula] for 1  ≤  j  ≤  N. Hence {fn} converges compactly on D(ζ0,r), by Theorem [\ref=Ind_J_PAM_1]. Thus we deduce that F is normal in D*. Since the set of irregular points is of cardinality at most q therefore by the definition, F is a quasi-normal family of order at most q in D.

The following example illustrates Theorem [\ref=qthm].

Let k = 1 and D = {z:|z| < 1}. Let a(z) = z2, b(z) = z + 2 be holomorphic functions such that a(z)  ≠  b(z), b(z)  ≠  0 in D. Define D1(f) = f'(z), then b(z)  ≠  D1(a) in D. Consider the family F of holomorphic function in D given by [formula] For each function fn∈F, there is a point [formula] so that fn satisfies condition (i) and (ii) of the theorem in [formula]. And F is a quasi-normal family of order 1.

If we replace D by [formula] in Example [\ref=3.3], then F satisfies all the conditions and F is a normal family in [formula], which means F is a quasi-normal family of order 0 in [formula].

In 1999, Fang and Hong extended Montel's normality test using the concept of shared set [\cite=Fang_Hong_99]. They proposed the following Theorem.

Let F be a family of functions meromorphic on a domain D. If each pair f and g in F shares the set S = {0,1,  ∞  } then F is normal on D.

It is a natural question to ask whether one can replace values by holomorphic functions on S. The following example confirms that the normality will no longer be assured if we replace values by holomorphic functions on S.

Let D = {z:|z| < 1} and [formula], clearly each pair f and g of F shares a1(z) = z, a2(z) = 2z and a3(z) = 3z but F is not normal in D.

Here we extend Theorem [\ref=Fang_Hong_99] using techniques of shared functions.

Let F be a family of functions meromorphic in a domain [formula]. Let a1,a2 and a3 be three distinct holomorphic functions. If each pair f and g of F shares a1,a2 and a3, then F is quasi-normal in D.

The following example elucidates Theorem [\ref=Main2_AnnPolo].

Let D = {z:|z| < 1} and [formula], clearly each pair f and g of F shares a1(z) = z / 2, a2(z) = z and a3(z) = 2z and F is quasi-normal in D.

We use the following results in order to prove Theorem [\ref=Main2_AnnPolo].

Let F be a family of meromorphic functions on a plane domain D and let α1, α2 and α3 be distinct meromorphic functions on D, one of which may be ∞   identically. If for each f∈F and z∈D, f(z)  ≠  αi(z), for all i = 1,2,3, then F is normal on D.

Let F be a family of meromorphic functions on Δ and let α1, α2 be distinct holomorphic functions on Δ. Suppose that for each f∈F and z∈D, f(z)  ≠  αi(z), for all i = 1,2. If F is normal in Δ' = {z:0 < |z| < 1}, then F is normal in D.

Since normality is a local property without loss of generality we may choose D: = Δ. By the assumption, for each j∈{1,2,3}, the set [formula] does not depend on the mapping f∈F.

Clearly, X is an isolated set in D otherwise [formula] for one of the j∈{1,2,3}. Also, for any fixed point [formula], there exists an open neighborhood Nε(z0) in [formula] such that for all [formula]

[formula]

We now prove that [formula] is a normal family on Nε(z0).

Assume that [formula] is not normal in Nε(z0), then by Zalcman's lemma, there exist a subsequence [formula] (after renumbering), a sequence of points {zn}  ⊂  Nε(z0) such that {zn}  →  z0 and a sequence of positive real numbers [formula] such that the sequence converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula] to a non-constant meromorphic function [formula].

Now, since fn(zn  +  ρnξ) - aj(zn  +  ρnξ)  ≠  0, thus by Hurwitz's theorem, for each j∈{1,2,3} we have either g(ξ)  ≠  aj(z0), for all [formula] or [formula] for all [formula]. If [formula] for one of the j∈{1,2,3}. Then g is constant. Otherwise gj(ξ)  ≠  aj(z0) for all j∈{1,2,3}. If all aj(z0),j = 1,2,3 are distinct by Picard's theorem g is constant. Otherwise we have two cases to consider

When two of aj(z0), j = 1,2,3 are equal. Without any loss of generality we may assume that a1(z0) = a2(z0) and a3(z0) is distinct from aj(z0) for j = 1,2. Since for all f∈F, z∈B(z0,ε) and j∈{1,2,3}, f(z)  ≠  aj(z). Also aj are holomorphic in D, we get that ai(z)  ≠  aj(z), 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3 in the deleted neighborhood N'ε(z0) of z0. Hence F is normal in N'ε(z0). Then by Lemma [\ref=ChangL_09] F is normal in Nε(z0). The last case is when a1(z0) = a2(z0) = a3(z0). Using Lemma [\ref=ChangT_09], in this case F is normal in Nε(z0).

Thus by the usual diagonal argument we can find a subsequence (again denoted by {fn}) which converges uniformly on compact subsets of [formula] to a meromorphic function f of [formula]. Hence {fn} is quasi-normal in D.
