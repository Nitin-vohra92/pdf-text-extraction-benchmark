Standard candles are one of the most important tools to study the universe. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are currently the maturest standard candles on cosmological scales, studies on which lead to the discovery of cosmic acceleration [\cite=Riess:1998cb] [\cite=Perlmutter:1998np]. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have also attracted much attention as standard candles (see e.g. [\cite=Qi:2011tr] and references therein). GRBs cover much wider redshift range than SNe Ia, but, on the other hand, have larger intrinsic scatters in their luminosity relations, which makes them less ideal as standard candles than SNe Ia. In this paper, the constraints of standards candles on the cosmological parameters are estimated for different cases. The dependence of the constraints on the intrinsic scatter of the luminosity relation and the redshift distribution of the standard candles is specifically investigated. The investigation is done by keeping in mind the current development of the GRBs as standard candles (see e.g. [\cite=Qi:2011tr]).

In [\cite=Qi:2015uxa], a general procedure for estimating constraints of standard candles on cosmological parameters using mock data was discussed and, as a result, analytical formulae for the marginal likelihood of the cosmological parameters were derived. Consider a general luminosity relation of the form

[formula]

where xis are some luminosity indicators which can be directly measured from observation, ε is a random variable accounting for the intrinsic scatter [formula] of the relation, and y has the form of

[formula]

where dL is the luminosity distance and F may be any physical quantity that can be directly measured from observation. Define

[formula]

and use li as the abbreviation for l(zi,θ,θ0). Ignoring the measurement uncertainties, we have the marginal likelihood of the cosmological parameters θ

[formula]

where p is the number of the calibration parameters which include the coefficients c and the intrinsic scatter [formula]. See [\cite=Qi:2015uxa] for more details.

From Eqs. ([\ref=eq:lztheta_dl]) and ([\ref=eq:Ltheta]), we can see that, to estimate the constraining capability of a sample of standard candles on the cosmological parameters (without considering the measurement uncertainties), we only need to input the information

about the luminosity relation: its intrinsic scatter and the number of luminosity indicators involved;

about the sample: the number of the standard candles and their redshifts.

No further detailed information is needed. This much simplifies the procedure and makes things transparent and clear. For example, one can immediately tell from Eq. ([\ref=eq:Ltheta]) that the smaller the intrinsic scatter [formula] is and/or the larger the sample size N is, the more sensitive the marginal likelihood L(θ) is to the variation of the cosmological parameters θ, which means that the constraint is tighter. The Hubble constant only contributes to l(z,θ,θ0) a constant that is same for all the standard candles and has no effect on σl, so L(θ) is independent of the Hubble constant and we cannot directly constrain it in this way.

Here, utilizing Eqs. ([\ref=eq:lztheta_dl]) and ([\ref=eq:Ltheta]), the constraining capability of standard candles on cosmological parameters was estimated using mock data. The flat ΛCDM with Ωm  =  0.3 was used as the fiducial model and p  =  3 was assumed. The constraints on (Ωm,ΩΛ) for the ΛCDM model and on (Ωm,w) for the flat wCDM model were studied. The dependence of the constraints on the intrinsic scatter of the luminosity relation and the redshift distribution of the standard candles was specifically investigated. For the intrinsic scatter of the luminosity relation, [formula], 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 were considered. For the redshift distribution of the standard candles, five cases were considered, i.e., 500 standard candles uniformly distributing in the redshift range
