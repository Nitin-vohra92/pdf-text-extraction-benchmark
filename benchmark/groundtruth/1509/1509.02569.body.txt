Refinement of the right-hand side of Hermite-Hadamard inequality for simplices

Introduction

The classical Hermite-Hadamard inequality [\cite=Had] states that for a convex function [formula]

[formula]

There are many generalizations. One of them ([\cite=Bes]) says that if [formula] is a simplex with barycenter [formula] and vertices [formula] and [formula] is convex, then

[formula]

In this paper we aim to improve the right-hand side of the last inequality.

Definitions and lemmas

For a fixed natural number n  ≥  1 let [formula]. Suppose [formula] are such that the vectors [formula] are linearly independent. Suppose K is a nonempty subset of N with k + 1 elements (0  ≤  k  ≤  n) and denote the elements of [formula] by [formula]. The set [formula] is called a simplex (or a k-simplex if we want to emphasize its dimension). The n-simplex ΔN will be denoted by Δ.

Given two sets K  ⊂  L  ⊂  N the simplex ΔK is called a face (or k-face) of ΔL.

The points in ΔK admit unique representation of the form

[formula]

The k + 1-tuple [formula] is called barycentric coordinates. The point is called the barycenter of ΔK.

If Σ is a k-dimensional simplex and [formula] is an integrable function, the we shall denote its average value over the simplex by [formula], i.e.

[formula]

The integration here is with respect to the k-dimensional Lebesgue measure denoted by [formula] and [formula] denotes the k-dimensional volume.

With this notation we can write the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:HH-Bess] as

[formula]

The set [formula] is called a standard simplex.

For every k-simplex ΔK we define a one-to-one mapping φK:Ek  →  ΔK given by the formula Note that [formula], so the absolute value of its Jacobian equals [formula]. This means, that for an integrable function [formula] the identity

[formula]

holds. In particular [formula].

A partition of N is a set

[formula]

We say that L refines K (and write [formula]) if every element of L is a subset of an element of K.

Faces based refinemets

The right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:HH-Bess] shows that the average of a convex function over a simplex can be bounded by the convex combination of its average values over its 0-faces. Our main result - Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and its corollaries show how to generalize this fact.

Let [formula] be a partition of N and [formula] be a convex function. Define

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

To prove this theorem we shall need Lemma [\ref=lem:main].

Let K,L  ⊂  N be two disjoint, nonempty sets with [formula] and [formula]. Further, let [formula] be a convex function. Then

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the vertices of ΔK and by [formula] its barycentric coordinates. Similarly, let [formula] be the vertices of ΔL and by [formula] its barycentric coordinates. Every point [formula] can be represented as Let [formula] and αi  =  αi' / s, βj  =  βj' / (1 - s) (if division by zero occurs we assume the result is zero). Then Let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

Its Jacobian equals

[formula]

Changing variable in the integral yields

[formula]

Using convexity of f and the formula [\eqref=eq:integral] we obtain

[formula]

Lemma follows from [\eqref=Jacobian_Phi], [\eqref=eq:changing_variable] and [\eqref=eq:calculating_integral].

Now we can prove our main result.

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:main] that the function

[formula]

is subadditive on disjoint sets, so [\eqref=eq:thmmain2] follows by mathematical induction on the cardinality of partition.

Since [formula] for any partition K we obtain the refinements of the Hermite-Hadamard inequality.

For any partition K the inequalities

[formula]

hold.

Applying Corollary [\ref=coro:main] to all possible pairs consisting of a vertex and its opposite face one obtains the following result.

Let [formula] be a convex function. Then the inequality

[formula]

holds.

If N can be divided into disjoint subsets of the same cardinality, then applying Corollary [\ref=coro:main] to all possible partitions and summing the obtained inequalities one gets the following corollary.

Let [formula] be a convex function and d be a divisor of [formula]. Then

[formula]

It is known (see e.g. [\cite=Som]) that the volume of a regular simplex [formula] with unit edges equals [formula]. In this case Corollary [\ref=coro:main1] yields

Let f be a convex function defined on a regular simplex Δ with unit edges. Let d be a divisor of [formula]. Then

[formula]

Barycentric refinements

In case of one dimension the right-hand side of [\eqref=eq:HH-dim1] can be refined as follows ([\cite=Ham] [\cite=WW]):

[formula]

Given the fact that both f(a) and f(b) are the barycenters of 0-faces, we see that in this case the average value of f over a simplex is bounded by a convex combination of its values on barycenters of all faces. We shall generalize this result to simplices.

Let us begin with lemma.

Let [formula] be the barycenter of Δ and let [formula]. If [formula] is convex, then

[formula]

Note that we can identify the partitions of N with partitions of the set of vertices of a simplex. The barycenter divides Δ into n + 1 simplices

[formula]

For each of them we split its vertices into two groups: [formula] and [formula] and apply Lemma [\ref=lem:main] to these partitions. Taking into account that [formula] for every i, we get

[formula]

Summing these inequalities completes the proof.

Applying [\eqref=eq:HH-Bess] to the right-hand side of [\eqref=neq:xyz1] we generalize the inequality [\eqref=eq:HH-lepsza].

Let [formula] be an arbitrary simplex with vertices [formula] and let [formula] be the barycenter of Δ. Then for every convex function [formula] we have the estimate

[formula]

But we can do much better: instead of [\eqref=eq:HH-Bess] we can use inductively Lemma [\ref=lem:barycenter] to (n - 1)-faces etc. and continue this process until we reach 0-faces. Thus we obtain

[formula]

Combining the results of Corollary [\ref=coro:main] and Theorem [\ref=thm:th2] one can produce various new upper bounds for the average value of f over the simplex. Below we show one of them.

Splitting the vertices of Δ into the maximum number of groups of k elements and one group of l elements, where l < k, and taking the average over all such splits one gets.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary simplex and let [formula] be its vertices.

[formula]

where [formula].

In particular we obtain.

Let [formula] be an arbitrary simplex with vertices [formula]. Then for every convex function [formula] we have

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula].
