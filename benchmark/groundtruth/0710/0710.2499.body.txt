Dynamical instability of the XY spiral state of ferromagnetic condensates

Spinor condensates of ultracold atoms [\cite=sengstock-05] [\cite=chapman-05] [\cite=bloch-06] [\cite=dsk-06] [\cite=bloch-07] [\cite=pfau-05] [\cite=ho-98] [\cite=machida-98] [\cite=yip-00] are the latest addition to the class of many-body systems with multicomponent order parameters. One of the most intriguing manifestations of the high symmetry of such systems is the possibility of a large variety of spin textures and topological defects. While earlier studies of liquid crystal nematics and superfluid 3He demonstrated the existence of spin textures, experiments with spinor condensates provide a unique opportunity to investigate their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Understanding dynamical properties of spin textures will provide valuable insight into many open problems of quantum magnets and spinful superfluids, from analysis of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism of nucleating topological defects when crossing a quantum phase transition [\cite=zurek-99] to finding the fundamental limits of spinor BEC magnetometers [\cite=higbie-07].

In this paper we investigate theoretically the stability of the spin spirals in ferromagnetic S=1 condensates (see Fig. 1.) Such states represent the simplest type of spin structures and can be prepared experimentally by applying a gradient of the magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the magnetization axis [\cite=higbie-05]. Our main result is the prediction of dynamical instabilities for spiral states, which we summarize Fig. 2. We find that rotation of the magnetization vector from the XY plane to the z direction drives the instability at small quadratic Zeeman energy while rotations within the XY plane are responsible at large magnetic fields. Surprisingly we observe that the unstable modes are characterized by wavevectors that can be considerably larger than the wavevector of the initial spiral state. Other instabilities in spinor condensates discussed previously include Castaing instabilities [\cite=castaing-84] in incoherent non-condensed two component 87Rb [\cite=kuklov-02] and the modulational instability of a uniform spinor condensate [\cite=robins-01] [\cite=ueda-05] [\cite=lamacraft-07a].

Our starting point is the microscopic Hamiltonian

[formula]

where [formula] with α = x,y,z are annhilation operators for F = 1 bosons with mass m and (Fα)βγ are angular momentum operators. We use a matrix notation with suppressed indices where *  , T, and [formula] denote the complex conjugate, transpose, and the conjugate transpose, respectively. For example, [formula] ([formula]) is a column (row) vector while Fz is a matrix

Interaction strengths are given by g0 = 4π2a0 / m, gs = 4π2(a0 - a2) / 3m [\cite=ho-98] in terms of the s-wave scattering lengths aF for two atoms colliding with total angular momentum F and : : denotes normal ordering. For 87Rb, a0 = 101.8aB and a2 = 100.4aB where aB is the Bohr radius [\cite=verhaar-02] giving positive gs and ferromagnetic interactions.

This Hamiltonian has a [formula] symmetry of global phase rotations and spin rotations about the z axis. The chemical potential μ and linear Zeeman energy p are Lagrange multipliers controlling the corresponding conserved quantities

[formula]

where n is the total particle density and fz is the z component of the magnetization per particle.

Due to conservation of Fz, static magnetic fields enter through the quadratic Zeeman energy q instead of the linear Zeeman energy p. Moreover, q can be further manipulated through the AC Stark shifts. From here on, we take representative values q = 70 Hz G- 2 B2 where B is the magnetic field and n = 2.2  ×  1014 cm- 3 [\cite=dsk-06]. We neglect here magnetic dipole interactions [\cite=pu-04] [\cite=saito-07].

The XY spiral state is prepared from an initial cigar shaped condensate with uniform XY magnetization by applying a magnetic field gradient along the axial or z axis. After switching off the gradient, imaging of the transverse magnetization can be used to study the stability of the XY spiral state. As illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:spiral], the transverse magnetization winds along the z axis. The transverse magnetization is fully polarized for q = fz = 0 and is suppressed due to population of the mz = 0 component of [formula] when q  ≠  0 or fz  ≠  0. In the presence of an instability, the system fragments into domains carrying different magnetization vectors.

Analyzing the generation of the XY spiral state requires understanding of the complicated non-equilibrium dynamics. We focus on studying the resulting non-equilibrium stationary state which we assume is well-described as a coherent condensate. Such states are given by mean-field solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations implied by Eq. [\ref=eq:hamiltonian] which carry XY spiral order. Compared to stable ground states, these non-equilibrium stationary states are in general metastable and decay via linear and non-linear processes. We consider the linear stability of such states with respect to small fluctuations by analyzing the spectrum of collective modes. The distinction between stable and metastable stationary states also arises for spinless bosons in a moving optical lattice [\cite=wu-01] [\cite=smerzi-02] and in optics in the context of the four-wave mixing instabilities (like the superradiance instability), in which a mean-field treatment may yield a stationary situation only because it neglects the spontaneous scattering into initially unoccupied modes of the system [\cite=fwm].

To perform the stability analysis, it will be useful to consider a frame comoving with the XY spiral order. We thus introduce the substitution

[formula]

where κ is the spiral wavevector. The comoving frame Hamiltonian is then given by Eq. [\ref=eq:hamiltonian] with the subsitution

[formula]

We use this spin-dependent effective Hamiltonian to study the stability of the non-equilibrium XY spiral state. However, we note that it may be possible to explicitly engineer a physical Hamiltonian of this form through continuous Raman excitation similar to that described in Ref. [\cite=higbie-02].

In the adiabatic limit which we describe first, the components of [formula] are able to adjust their populations in order to accomodate the XY spiral order. The interaction terms of Eq. [\ref=eq:hamiltonian] describe spin flip processes that mix the components of [formula] but still conserve the overall magnetization. The components of [formula] in the resulting XY spiral state then describes a compromise between the kinetic energy cost of the winding spiral and gain in interaction energy.

We begin by looking for mean-field solutions of the GP equations in the comoving frame of the form [formula] where we use the following parametrization

[formula]

which automatically gives the correct conserved quantities of Eq. [\ref=eq:conserved] by construction.

The parameter η describes a global phase that spontaneously breaks U(1) phase rotation symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Similarly, φ gives the orientation of the magnetization vector and breaks SO(2) spin rotation symmetry. Here [formula] gives a relative phase between the z and transverse components of [formula]. Solutions of the GP equations for [formula] distinguish between gs > 0 ferromagnetic and gs < 0 antiferromagnetic interactions where [formula] and [formula], respectively. Recall we focus on the gs > 0 case. Finally, χ controls the relative magnitude between the z and transverse components of [formula]. After introducing the dimensionless quantities τ  =   tanh (χ) and Q = q / 2gsn we find the GP equations give the condition

[formula]

As in Ref. [\cite=ueda-07], we find three classes of mean-field solutions: polar, ferromagnet, and XY spiral state. The polar state occurs for fz = 0 and Q > 1 while the ferromagnet occurs for fz  =    ±  1. Both of these states occur only on isolated lines in the mean-field phase diagram and do not support XY spiral order.

We now analyze the stability of the XY spiral state by studying the spectrum of collective fluctuations [formula] about the mean-field solution [formula]. We take [formula]. and focus first on the fz = 0 case. Using the standard Bogoliubov analysis, we find the excitation energies ωk satisfies the eigenvalue equation

[formula]

where Mk and N are given by

[formula]

Recall we use a matrix notation so that [formula] ([formula]) is a scalar (matrix). We consider the one-dimensional case relevant for cigar shaped condensates where we can take kz = k.

The XY spiral state spontaneously breaks [formula] symmetry of global phase and spin rotations and we find both a gapless charge and spin mode (as required by the Goldstone theorem) with linear dispersions. However, the spin mode can develop imaginary frequencies which indicate the presence of a dynamical instability.

We find there are several distinct types of behavior for the spin mode exhibiting a dynamical instability. The first possibility is a branch of unstable modes starting at k = 0 which we denote as DI1 as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:dispersion]. The second is a branch of unstable modes starting modes starting at k > 0 which we denote as DI1'. The third possibility is two distinct branches of unstable modes starting at k = 0 and k > 0 as illustrated in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:dispersion].

We construct the phase diagrams illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:critq] by characterizing the behavior of the spin mode as a function of the spiral wavevector κ and quadratic Zeeman energy q. We first consider the adiabatic limit characterized by an interpolation between long-wavelength instabilities in the limit of large and small q. Both instabilities can be throught of as unwinding of the spiral order through rotations of the magnetization vector, but they arise from qualitatively distinct physics.

When q is zero, the system is rotationally symmetric. In this limit, the XY spiral state is potentially unstable towards unwinding through arbitrary SO(3) rotations of the magnetization vector from the XY plane to the z axis. However, small but finite q provides a potential energy barrier to such a process. When the kinetic energy stored in the non-uniform winding is sufficiently large, small fluctuations corresponding to such rotations can overcome this energetic barrier and grow exponentially giving rise to a dynamical instability. In particular, the instability in this regime is due to fluctuations in the direction of the magnetization vector.

In contrast, large q explictly breaks rotational symmetry. The magnetization vector is essentially confined to the XY plane and the unwinding of the XY spiral state can then only proceed via SO(2) rotations within that plane. Such rotations proliferate near the quantum phase transition to the polar state when fluctuations in the magnitude of the magnetization vector are large.

This large q instability can be mapped to the instability of current carrying states for spinless bosons [\cite=altman-05]. Here the effective SO(2) magnetization order parameter maps to the U(1) order parameter of spinless bosons. In addition, the critical fluctuations near the transition to the polar state driving the instability map to those of bosons near the Mott transition.

From the physical arguments above, we expect the XY spiral state to be stable for wavevectors less than κ2 / 2m  ~  q for small q when kinetic energy is insufficient to overcome the potential energy barrier. Similarly, the XY spiral should be stable for wavevectors less than κ2 / 2m  ~  (q - qc) near the quantum phase transition to the polar state at qc. The boundaries in Fig. [\ref=fig:critq] can be obtained explicitly [\cite=cherng-07] as

[formula]

which gives κ2 / 2m  ≤  q and κ2 / 2m = (qc - q) / 3 for for small and large q, respectively, in agreement with the physical arguments.

Also notice in Fig. [\ref=fig:critq] an isolated line on which the XY spiral state is stable at small B and intermediate κ. In fact, the dynamical instability in the DI1' surrounding this line is weak in the sense that the imaginary part of ωk is comparatively small. The energetic arguments given earlier for the small B limit seem to suggest increasing κ makes the XY spiral state more unstable. However, as κ increases further, the populations in the components of [formula] change appreciably.

In this limit, the XY spiral state can thought of as having a significant polar component. It has been shown previously that the polar state has a dynamical instability with a characteristic wavevector [formula] [\cite=robins-01]. When the spiral wavevector is on the order of this characteristic wavevector, the XY spiral state becomes less unstable. Physically, the spiral order tends to suppress the instability of the polar component.

After analyzing the fz = 0 case in detail, we now briefly discuss the fz  ≠  0 case. The collective mode phase diagrams for the adiabatic limit are shown in the top of Fig. [\ref=fig:critq_multi] with fz = 0.05 to the left and fz = 0.5 to the right. The small fz phase diagrams are qualitatively similar to the fz = 0 case. However, there is no polar state which only occurs for fz = 0 but there is an additional region which exhibits a spin mode exhibiting a dispersion with negative frequencies. corresponding to a Landau instability. For large fz, the phase diagrams no longer exhibit a characteristic peak for the stable region as a function of q.

So far the results have been focused on the adiabatic limit where the components of [formula] can adjust due to magnetization spin flip processes. In practice, the preparation of the XY spiral state can also occur on a timescale shorter than that of spin flips. We thus briefly comment on qualitatively similar results in the sudden limit where the populations of each component cannot change from their initial values. To take this effect into account, we consider mean-field solutions of the GP equation of the form [formula] with ωx  =  ωy  ≠  ωz and [formula] is as in Eq. [\ref=eq:mf]. Notice the components of [formula] evolve at different frequencies which allows for solutions with the necessary populations for each component.

We then perform the same analysis of the collective modes as in the adiabatic limit. This gives for fz = 0 in the sudden limit the phase diagrams in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:critq]. As in the adiabatic limit, the sudden limit is characterized by an interpolation between long-wavelength instabilities in the small and large B limits arising from the same physical origins. The region where the XY spiral state is stable is given by

[formula]

which gives κ2 / 2m = q / 2 and κ2 / 2m = (qc - q) / 2 for the small q and large q limits, respectively. Up to coefficients, this is of the same form as the adiabatic limit. The fz = 0.05 and fz = 0.5 phase diagrams for the sudden limit are shown in the bottom of Fig. [\ref=fig:critq_multi] and exhibit the same structure as the adiabatic limit.

In this paper we have focused on the one-dimensional limit relevant for cigar shaped condensates. However, the formalism we used can be readily adapted for the three-dimensional case. In particular, one just needs to take kz = k cos θ where θ is the angle between the mode wavevector and spiral wavevector in Eq. [\ref=eq:omegakaux].

In summary, we studied a possible mechanism for the instability of the XY spiral state. Focusing on the limits where the XY spiral is prepared adiabatically or suddenly, we demonstrated that when the spiral wavevector exceeds a critical value spin wave energies become imaginary. This indicates the presence of a dynamical instability and exponential growth of fluctuations. We traced the physical origin of these instabilities to unwinding of the magnetization vector through rotations from the XY plane to the z axis for small quadratic Zeeman energy q and within the XY plane for large q.
