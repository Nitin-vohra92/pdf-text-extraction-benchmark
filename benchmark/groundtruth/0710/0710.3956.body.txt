The solution of a memorable problem by a special artifice of calculation

1. The problem which I take up for solving here can be thus enunciated: To find a curved line AM (Fig. 1), with coordinates CP = x,PM = y, the arc AM = s and chord [formula], so that the integral formula [formula] obtains a maximum or a minimum value, with v any fixed function of z.

2. In general, if a relation is sought between two variables x and y, and it is put dy = pdx, and V is any function of these x,y and p, so that its differential has this form: dV = Mdx + Ndy + Pdp, then the integral formula [formula] will have a maximum or a minimum value when it happens that Ndx = dP, so that this equation would express the sought relation between x and y.

3. While the entire problem is reduced to this equation, it will however be useful to further consider another equation which is equivalent to the first. For when Ndx = dP, which multiplied by p becomes Ndy = pdP, substituting in this value will produce

[formula]

It therefore follows that Mdx = d  ·  (V - Pp). This equation is the most accommodating for use in our analysis.

4. Let us now transfer these general precepts to the proposed problem. And first putting dy = pdx we will have [formula]. Next, since it is [formula], it will be [formula]. Then indeed, as v is a function of z, let us put dv = qdz and it will then be [formula]. Now therefore for the formula of the maximum or the minimum we will have [formula]. By differentiating this we will get

[formula]

and with the differential compared to the general form it will be [formula], [formula] and [formula].

5. Therefore, the equation comprising the total solution of our problem, which was Ndx = dP, now assumes this form: [formula]. As well, the other equation which will be used, since [formula], may be expressed thus:

[formula]

Hence, since the first equation is

[formula]

we will be led to this:

[formula]

and hence it will be

[formula]

and this is the equation which we employ for getting the solution of our problem.

6. Let us divide this equation by zz = xx + yy, so that we will obtain this form:

[formula]

where it is clear that the integral of the first side is [formula]. In truth it seems here that little gain be obtained, since the latter part of the equation is completely intractable. In the meanwhile however let us put φ to be the angle whose tangent is [formula], so that our equation would be [formula].

7. With this angle φ introduced, we will be able to render the coordinates x and y susceptible to calculation. For since it is [formula], it will be x = z sin φ and y = z cos φ, by means of whose values the letter p can also be extracted. Indeed because [formula], it will be

[formula]

Now let us put dz = tzdφ, so that it becomes

[formula]

This expression clearly expresses the tangent of the difference of two angles, the tangent of the first of which is = t, while the latter angle is =  φ.

8. Thus for p equal to the tangent of any angle whatsoever, let us put [formula], and ω will be the difference of these angles, namely [formula], whence [formula]. Also indeed, because [formula] and so [formula], it will further be [formula]. Hence our equation to be resolved will be [formula]. Moreover from the preceding, since the form was [formula], hence

[formula]

9. Also, because we have put dz = tzdφ, it will be [formula], and having substituted in this value our equation takes the form:

[formula]

Then, since qdz = dv, the integration can be done most conveniently by logarithms; for it will be

[formula]

and consequently we will obtain this integrated formula: [formula].

10. Now let us investigate the value of t from this equation, in which it will be [formula]. For since [formula], we gather from this equation that

[formula]

which is a differential equation of the first degree between the angle φ and the distance CM = z, if indeed v is a function of z itself. Indeed for the angle it is noted that [formula] and hence x = z sin φ and y = z cos φ, so that now the two coordinates x and y can by expressed by the same variable z, which is the most complete solution of our problem.

11. Here I am compelled however to admit that I would perhaps not have obtained this solution if it had not already been noted by me elsewhere; and for this reason, the artifice which I used in this calculation seems worthy of more attention, for it is not completely obvious and without doubt will be able to be used in many other cases.

12. Thus I will treat here another solution of the same problem, which I have employed to get the same final solution found above without any detours. Namely, I recast the entire question into two other coordinates, suited for defining a curve. The first is the distance CM (Fig. 2), which I shall call here = x, and the other is the angle BCM, designated by the letter y. Then an element of the curve will be [formula], which by putting dy = pdx turns into [formula], whence the integral formula for maximization or minimization will be [formula].

13. We then compare this formula with the general formula [formula], and we will have [formula]. Therefore this quantity, because v is a function of x only, involves only the variable quantities x and p, with the third p completely excluded; whence, since we have put dV = Mdx + Ndy + Pdp, it will be

[formula]

Hence the equation containing the solution, Ndx = dP, turns into this: dP = 0, whence [formula], so that [formula] and hence it at once follows that

[formula]

and thus now we have arrived at this equation:

[formula]

14. We may now transfer this very simple solution gained for the denominator in the above solution, namely if we write z in place of the letter x and the element dφ in place of dy, and in this way the solution of our problem will be contained in this equation:

[formula]

which, since v is a function of z itself, completely agrees with that which we deduced in the prior solution by many detours. In particular it should be observed here that this solution is always valid, whatever function of z is taken for v. In particular as well, this is noteworthy because if v is taken to be a power of z, the satisfying curve will develop algebraically.

15. For let us put v = zλ, and we will have this equation for the sought curve:

[formula]

For expanding this, let us set [formula], so that it becomes [formula]. Then indeed it will be

[formula]

and by taking the logarithmic differentials

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

so that we will now have [formula], and then by integrating

[formula]

But if then we take ψ as the angle whose tangent is [formula], it will be (λ + 1)φ  =  ψ and hence [formula]; whence, providing λ is a rational number, the angle φ will always be able to be determined algebraically from the angle ψ, and consequently, since from the assumed angle φ it will be [formula], everything will be able to be determined by this angle ψ, because we will have

[formula]

and hence [formula]; then indeed, since [formula], the coordinates will be [formula] and [formula]; all these values will thus be able to be exhibited algebraically.
