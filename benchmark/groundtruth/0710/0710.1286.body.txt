Introduction

Conventional x-ray radiography is based on the detection of differences in x-ray attenuation by different details in an object (sample). Thus, details with similar attenuation coefficient gives low contrast images. Enhanced contrast x-ray imaging can be achieved by using attenuation contrast agents. Alternatively, it can be achieved by exploiting the real part of the refraction index, which is responsible for the phase shifts, in addition to the imaginary part, which is responsible for the absorption. Such exploitation is done by the well-established x-ray phase-contrast imaging techniques. Several ways are reported in the literature to acquire phase-contrast images: a) propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging (PBI), that uses a monochromatic [\cite=rf1] [\cite=rf2] or polychromatic [\cite=rf3] partially coherent x-ray source; b) x-ray phase-contrast imaging based on x-ray interferometry [\cite=rf4] [\cite=rf5] and; c) analyzer-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging (ABI) [\cite=rf6] [\cite=rf7] [\cite=rf8] [\cite=rf9] [\cite=rf10], that uses diffraction by perfect single crystals. PBI is well known by its simplicity, once that, it does not require any sophisticated optics. The unique requirement is a high quality small source with high brilliance provided by micro focus x-ray sources [\cite=rf3] [\cite=rf11] [\cite=rf12] or, by the high brilliance and low emittance third generation synchrotron radiation sources [\cite=rf1] [\cite=rf2]. This technique can be developed in the edge detection geometry or in the holographic geometry [\cite=rf2], depending on the quality of the source and the distance from the sample to the detector. Such technique has been successfully applied severally in biology [\cite=rf13], medicine [\cite=rf14] [\cite=rf15] material sciences [\cite=rf2] [\cite=rf16] and archeology [\cite=rf17]. In the present work, a PBI setup using normal focus conventional x-ray source is proposed and realized. The idea is to get a reasonably transverse coherence length by creating a virtual micro source and by placing the sample far away from the source. To characterize such a setup attenuation contrast images (conventional radiography, CR) and propagation-based (PB) x-ray phase-contrast images of a polypropylene tube (low density material) were acquired. The images were also analyzed in terms of exposure time, contrast and signal to noise ratio. A description of the experiment followed by quantitative results and conclusions will be presented.

Experiment

The experimental setup (fig. 1) was mounted using a normal focus conventional x-ray source (Cu LFF target) set in the line focus geometry with a take off angle of 6o. Such take-off angle provides a virtual horizontal x-ray source size of 40 μm. To have an x-ray source with similar vertical dimension, a 50 μm slit was set horizontally, just after the beryllium window of the x-ray tube resulting in a virtual source size of 40 x 50 μm2. A vacuum path, 12 m long, was used along the x-rays path until the sample. Such vacuum path was made employing PVC tubes with 25 μm thick kapton windows and a pressure of 1 mbar. The field of view at the sample position was 75 x 75 mm2. The measured divergence of the beam on the sample was 6.10- 3 rad in the horizontal and vertical scattering planes. The x-ray generator was set at 25 kV in order to have lower energy photons therefore, large transverse coherence length, once that, the transverse coherence length (lt) is:

where λ is the wavelength of the incoming x-ray beam, D is the distance from the source to the sample and σx is the source size. The images were acquired using low-resolution commercial x-ray films (Kodak INSIGHT dental film). The PB images were obtained with the x-ray film set 2 m from the sample. Another vacuum path was also employed between the sample and the film. The CR was acquired with the x-ray film in contact with the sample to avoid phase effects.

Results

To characterize the present PBI setup, a polypropylene tube, with an external diameter of 6 mm and internal diameter of 3.8 mm (tube wall 1.1 mm thick) was used as sample. This tube was fixed on an one-layer paper (about 50 μm thick). The CR and PB images of the polypropylene tube are shown in figs. 2a and 3a, respectively. The cross-sections are shown in figs. 2b and 3b, respectively. The cross-sections simulations were done considering an incoming x-rays monochromatic (14.4 keV) plane wave beam being attenuated by the sample. A theoretical pixel size of 25 x 25 μm2 was considered. This is far of the real experiment, however it worked fairly well for the CR, as can be seen in fig. 2b. This means that, even using a white beam, the energies around 14 keV are the major contributors for the contrast in CR. This is reasonable, once that the simulation for a conventional x-ray Cu target at 25 kV shows a maximum of the Bremmstrahlung spectra at 15.5 keV [\cite=rf18].

A disagreement between the measured and simulated cross section profile can be seen for the PB image because the phase effects and the divergence of the beam were not considered in the simulations. However, it is worth noticing that phase effects could be seen in the measured cross-section profiles (indicated by arrows, in fig. 3b). Moreover, the edges and details of the tube are better defined in the PB image (fig. 3a) than in the CR (fig. 2a): for instance, a crack, not visible in the CR, is clearly seen in the PB image. Also, a background structure can be noted in the fig. 3a. Such structures can be attributed to the phase-contrast effects due to the one layer paper behind the tube. The edge enhanced effect can be attributed to the rapid variations in the refractive index (boundary effect) that produces strong phase-contrast, even using a polychromatic beam, as previously described by Wilkins [\cite=rf3]. For quantitative reasons the images, shown in figs. 2a and 3a, were compared with each other by measuring the area contrast (C), the signal to noise ratio in the area case (SNRarea), the visibility of the object edges (V) and the signal-to noise ratio for the edge case (SNRedge). These quantities are defined according to Pagot [\cite=rf19] and references therein in the following way:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where < Iobj  >   and < Ibackg  >   are the mean intensity values of a given area in the object and in the background, respectively; σobj and σbackg are the standard deviations of the distributions of Iobj and Ibackg; and finally, Imax and Imin are the maximum and minimum of the mean intensity profile across the edge. In general, the different PB and CR images were acquired with different beam intensities, but the exposure time for the object and for the background were the same.

The results are shown in tab. 1. The contrast (C) and the visibility of the object edges (V) for PB images are really higher than for CR. However, the good values of V show that the ABI is highly sensitive to the sample borders (jump of the phase in these regions). The low values for the signal to noise ratio are mainly due to the low intensity found in our measurements. This means, in equations (3) and (5), high values of σobj and σbackg. Such values could be improved by increasing the exposure times (typically 30 minutes, in our experiment). Also, SNRarea and SNRedge have worse (small) values for the PB images than for the CRs. A reason for that is because the background was taken with the paper, which produces phase effects. Therefore, higher values for σobj and σbackg are found. The present results show that such setup can be used for phase-contrast x-ray imaging and can be applied for studies of different kind of samples with large field of view (in the present work, 75 x 75 mm2). However, this setup can be improved by using a rotating anode tube (in order to get, at least, 10 times more intensity), increasing the distance from the source to the sample and employing a tomography stage with a high spatial resolution CCD detector.

Table 1: Contrast (C), signal-to-noise ratio in the area case (SNRarea), visibility of the object edges (V) and signal to noise ratio for the edge case (SNRedge) for PB image and CR. The visibility (V) and the SNRedge were obtained at the top edges of the tube (across the tube wall).

Conclusions

A propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging setup (PBI) was mounted using a conventional x-ray source. A virtual micro focus source was demonstrated by using a 6o take-off angle and a horizontal slit (50 μm). The sample was set 12 m from the source. The propagation-based (PB) x-ray phase-contrast images were acquired with the film and the sample set 2 m apart. Edge detection effects (that improve the contrast in the images) and details, such as a crack, not detected in the attenuation radiography (conventional radiography, CR) show that a PBI setup with a normal focus conventional x-ray source, as shown here, can be used as standard x-ray phase-contrast imaging setup for studying different kind of samples, with large field of view.
