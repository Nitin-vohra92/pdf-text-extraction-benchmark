Inflated planets and their low-mass companions

Introduction

Of the fourteen transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which radii have been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical estimates suggest. It has been proposed by [\citet=b4] that undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5 ms- 1 level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis as well as a direct transit search have further constrained the existence of very short-period companions, especially in resonant orbits. Whether or not a companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to nonzero values. This paper is a summary of [\citet=m1] which is dedicated to quantifying this effect.

The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its (non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. In fact, [\citet=m1] shows that the latter decays on a timescale which depends on the structure of the interior planet, a timescale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system. This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. On the other hand, there exist parameter combinations (Q-value of the innermost planet, companion mass and semimajor axis) for which significant eccentricity in the short-period planet can be sustained for at least the age of the system, and these include systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass.

Inflated planets

The three largest planets discovered to date are HD 209458b [\citep=c2] [\citep=h1], HAT P1b [\citep=b1] and WASP-1b [\citep=c1]. Table [\ref=planetdata] lists the measured attributes of these planets together with the estimated age and circularization timescales, the latter assuming a Q-value Qp = 3  ×  105. It is clear from this data that if the eccentricities are real, some mechanism operates to maintain them since τcirc  ≪  age in each case.

[\citet=b3] and [\cite=b2] calculated the rate at which energy needs to be deposited into a gas giant with a specified mass and age (and with and without a core) to maintain the observed radii of these planets. However, they assumed that the energy is distributed uniformly throughout the planet's envelope and dissipated locally; if the energy is instead transported and dissipated close (but not too close) to the surface, a smaller deposition rate may be adequate. Consequently, [\citet=b3] found that an eccentricity larger than that observed for HD 209458b is necessary to maintain the planet's radius, at least for reasonable Q-values.

Here we assume Qp = 3  ×  105, a value consistent with the analysis of [\citet=w3] for all short-period gas giants discovered at that time, and assume that the estimated eccentricities of the planets in Table [\ref=planetdata] are accurate. We will demonstrate that it is possible for extremely low-mass planets to maintain such eccentricities for at least the lifetime of the system.

Long-term eccentricity evolution

Figure [\ref=secular](a) shows three-body secular evolution for an HD 209458b-like system with a companion planet of mass 0.1MJ at 0.4 AU. The eccentricity of both planets varies periodically with the period reducing when the post-Newtonian potential of the star is included. Figure [\ref=secular](b) shows the evolution of the eccentricity of HD 209458b with the same companion but with tidal damping included. Here an artificially low value of Qp = 100 was chosen to clearly illustrate the behavior. This time the eccentricity appears to evolve to a fixed value on a timescale of around 1.4  ×  105 yr, which for Qp = 3  ×  105 corresponds to 0.42 Gyr (3τcirc; see [\citet=m1] for details). The "equilibrium" or "fixed-point" eccentricity is given by

[formula]

where ap and mp are the semimajor axis and mass of the observed planet, ac and mc are those of the hypothetical companion, ec is its eccentricity, [formula] and γ = 4(npap / c)2(m* / mc)(ac / ap)3. Here np is the observed planet's mean motion, m* is the star's mass and c is the speed of light. Capture by the fixed point is also accompanied by a transition from circulation to libration of the angle between the lines of apsides of the orbits.

While the system evolves to a (psuedo)-fixed point on the timescale 3τcirc (with very little change in ec), in the long run the true equilibrium or fixed-point state of the system is two circular orbits. This occurs on a timescale which is given approximately by

[formula]

where e*c is the value of ec when the system first finds e(eq)p, and F(ec) = ε3c(1 - αε- 1c  +  γ  ε3c)2 with [formula]. In fact, in general ([\ref=tauc]) tends to underestimate the true circularization time of the system, and a much more precise estimate is available [\citep=m1]. The analysis leading to this also reveals that a different type of solution exists for very low-mass companions. Such a solution does not involve slow exponential decay of the eccentricities, but rather a slow increase of the observed planet's eccentricity to a maximum value before rapid decay to zero. Figure [\ref=earth] demonstrates this behavior for a system with a companion mass of [formula], ac = 0.3 AU and ec(0) = 0.7. Such solutions have parameters which make e(eq)p (equation ([\ref=equilGR])) near singular. Also shown is an analytical solution [\citep=m1] and the approximate exponential solution with timescale ([\ref=tauc]). Clearly the latter now overestimates the timescale, however, for realistic values of Qp this is still much longer than a Hubble time.

Figure [\ref=conearth] demonstrates that these "pathological" solutions are not actually rare, existing for a significant range of values of the companion mass and semimajor axis. Notice the extremely low-masses associated with some non-zero values of the observed planet's current eccentricity (assuming a system age of 5.5 Gyr). "Normal" (exponentially decaying) systems exist for larger companion masses and semimajor axes. Such low-mass solutions are consistent with the planet migration studies of [\citet=r1] and [\citet=f1].
