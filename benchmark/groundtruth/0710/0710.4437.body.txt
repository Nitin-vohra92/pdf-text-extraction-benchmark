Introduction

Let M be a compact surface, P be either the real line [formula] or the circle S1. Then the group D(M) of C∞ diffeomorphisms of M acts on the space C∞(M,P) by the following formula:

[formula]

for h∈D(M) and f∈C∞(M,P).

We say that a smooth (C∞) map [formula] is Morse if

critical points of f are non-degenerate and belong to the interior of M;

f is constant on every connected component of [formula].

Let f∈C∞(M,P), [formula] be the set of critical points of f, and [formula] be the subgroup of D(M) consisting of diffeomorphisms h such that [formula].

Then we can define the stabilizers S(f) and [formula], and orbits O(f) and [formula] with respect to the actions of the groups D(M) and [formula]. Thus

[formula]

[formula]

We endow the spaces D(M) and C∞(M,P) with the corresponding C∞ Whitney topologies. They induce certain topologies on the stabilizers and orbits.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the identity path components of the groups D(M) and [formula], [formula] and [formula] be the identity path components of the corresponding stabilizers, and Of(f) and [formula] be the path-components of f in the corresponding orbits with respect to the induced topologies.

If [formula] is discrete set, e.g. when f is Morse, then [formula].

Since [formula], we have that [formula]. Conversely, let [formula] be an isotopy such that [formula] and ht∈S(f) for all t∈I., i.e. [formula]. We have to show that [formula] for all t∈I. Notice that [formula], whence [formula]. Since [formula] is discrete and [formula] fixes [formula], we see that so does every ht, i.e. [formula].

Let [formula] be a Morse map. Denote by ci, (i = 0,1,2), the total numbers of critical points of f of index i and let n = c0 + c1 + c2 be the total number of critical points of f.

Notice that for every Morse map f its orbits O(f) and [formula] are Fréchet submanifolds of C∞(M,P) of finite codimension, see [\cite=Poenaru] [\cite=Sergeraert]. Therefore, e.g. [\cite=Palais], these orbits have the homotopy types of CW-complexes. But in general these complexes may have infinite dimensions.

Let X be a topological space which is homotopy equivalent to some CW-complex. Then a homotopy dimension [formula] of X is the minimal dimension of a CW-complex homotopy equivalent to X. In particular [formula] can be equal to ∞  . It is also evident that if [formula], then (co-)homology of X vanish in dimensions greater that [formula].

If π is a finitely presented group π, then the geometric dimension of π, denoted [formula], is the homotopy dimension of its Eilenberg-Mac Lane space K(π,1):

[formula]

In [\cite=Maks:AGAG:2006] the author described the homotopy types of [formula], Of(f), and [formula]. It follows from these results that

[formula]

In fact, [formula] is contractible provided either f has at least one critical point of index 1, i.e., [formula] or M is non-orientable. Otherwise [formula].

Also, Of(f)≃S1 for Morse mappings T2  →  S1 and K2  →  S1 without critical points, and Of(f) is contractible in all other cases, where K stands for the Klein bottle.

For Of(f) the description is not so complete. But if f is generic, i.e., it takes distinct values at distinct critical points, then

[formula]

Actually, in this case Of(f) is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to Tk or to [formula] for some [formula], where Tk is a k-dimensional torus.

Thus the upper bound for [formula] (at least in generic case) depends only on the number of critical points of f at each index.

In this note we will show that [formula] for arbitrary Morse mapping [formula] having exactly [formula] critical points. Notice that if n = 0, then f is generic, and in fact [formula], see [\cite=Maks:AGAG:2006].

Let [formula] be a Morse map and n be the total number of critical points of f. Assume that [formula]. Denote by [formula] the configuration space of n points of the interior [formula] of M. Then Of(f) is homotopy equivalent to a certain covering space F(f) of [formula].

[formula], whence (co-)homology of Of(f) vanish in dimensions ≥  2n.

Since [formula] and its connected covering spaces are open manifolds of dimension 2n, they are homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes of dimensions not greater than 2n - 1.

For simplicity denote π  =  π1Of(f). Since the covering map [formula] yields a monomorphisms of fundamental groups, we obtain the following:

The fundamental group π of Of(f) is a subgroup of the n-th braid group [formula] of M.

Suppose that M is aspherical, i.e., [formula]. Then Of(f) is aspherical as well, i.e., K(π,1)-space, whence  [formula]

Actually the aspherity of Of(f) for the case [formula] is proved in [\cite=Maks:AGAG:2006].

But it can be shown by another arguments. It is well known and can easily be deduced from [\cite=FadellNeuwirth] that for an aspherical surface M every of its configuration spaces [formula] and thus every covering space of [formula] are aspherical as well. Hence so is F(f) and thus Of(f) itself.

A presentation for π will be given in another paper.

Orbits of the actions of [formula] and [formula]

Let [formula] be a Morse map and

[formula]

be the natural projection. Then Of(f) is the orbit of f with respect to [formula] and [formula] is the orbit of f with respect to [formula]. In other words,

[formula]

The proof is based on the following general statement. Let G be a topological group transitively acting on a topological space O and f∈O. Denote by Ge the path-component of the unit e in G and let Of be the path-component of f in O.

Suppose that the mapping p:G  →  O defined by

[formula]

satisfies a covering path axiom (in particular, this holds when p is a locally trivial fibration). Then Of is the orbit of f with respect to the induced action of Ge on O, i.e., p(Ge) = Of.

Evidently, p(Ge)  ⊂  Of. Conversely, let g∈Of. Then there exists a path ω:I  →  Of between f and g, i.e., ω(0) = f and ω(1) = g. Since p satisfies the covering path axiom, ω lifts to the path :I  →  G such that (0) = e and [formula]. Then [formula]. Thus p(Ge) = Of. It remains to note that the mapping [\eqref=equ:p-d2o] is a locally trivial fibration, see e.g. [\cite=Poenaru] [\cite=Sergeraert], and D(M) (resp. [formula]) transitively acts on the orbit O(f) (resp. [formula]). Therefore the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lm:p_Ge_Xf] are satisfied.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=th:hom-type-Orbits]

Let [formula] be the configuration space of n points of the interior [formula] of M. Thus

[formula]

where

[formula]

is called the pure n-th configuration space of [formula], and [formula] is the symmetric group of n symbols freely acting on [formula] by permutations of coordinates.

We can regard [formula] as the space of n-tuples of mutually distinct points of [formula].

Denote by [formula] the set of critical points of f. Then for every g∈Of(f) the set Σg of its critical points is a point in [formula]. Hence the correspondence g  ↦  Σg is a well-defined mapping

[formula]

(i) The mapping k is a locally trivial fibration. The connected component of the fiber containing f is homeomorphic to [formula].

(ii) Let [formula], [formula], be the corresponding homomorphism of homotopy groups induced by k. Then k1 is a monomorphism and all other ki for [formula] are isomorphisms.

Assuming that Lemma [\ref=lm:prop_of_k] is proved we will now complete our theorem. Let F(f) be the covering space of [formula] corresponding to the subgroup

[formula]

Then k lifts to the mapping :Of(f)  →  F(f) which induces isomorphism of all homotopy groups. Since Of(f) and F(f) are connected, we obtain from (2) that [formula] is a desired homotopy equivalence. Theorem [\ref=th:hom-type-Orbits] is proved modulo Lemma [\ref=lm:prop_of_k].

(i) Recall, [\cite=FadellNeuwirth], that the following evaluation map

[formula]

is a locally trivial principal fibration with fiber

[formula]

Let [formula] be the projection defined by [formula]. Then the set of critical points of the function [formula] is [formula]. Therefore e coincides with the following composition:

[formula]

Since e and (by Proposition [\ref=pr:Orbff_is_orbit_for_DiffIdM]) the mapping p are principal locally trivial fibrations, we obtain that k is also a locally trivial fibration with fiber (f) being the orbit of f with respect to the group (f).

It is easy to see that the identity component of the group (f) coincides with [formula], whence by Proposition [\ref=pr:Orbff_is_orbit_for_DiffIdM], the connected component of (f) containing f is [formula].

(ii) As noted above since [formula], it follows from [\cite=Maks:AGAG:2006] that [formula] is contractible. Then from the exact sequence of homotopy groups of the fibration k we obtain that for i  ≥  2 every ki is an isomorphism, and k1 is a monomorphism. Lemma [\ref=lm:prop_of_k] is proved.

In general the covering map [formula] is not regular, i.e., π1Of(f)  ≈  π1F(f) is not a normal subgroup of [formula].

Theorem [\ref=th:hom-type-Orbits] does not answer the question whether Of(f) has the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex. Indeed, since M is compact, it follows from [\eqref=equ:conf_sp] that Bn(M) can be regarded as an open cellular (i.e. consisting of full cells) subset of a finite CW-complex [formula]. Therefore if the covering map [formula] is an infinite sheet covering, i.e., π1Of(f) has an infinite index in Bn(M), then we obtain a priori an infinite cellular subdivision of F(f). On the other hand, as noted above, for a generic Morse map [formula] a finiteness of the homotopy type of Of(f) follows from [\cite=Maks:AGAG:2006].
