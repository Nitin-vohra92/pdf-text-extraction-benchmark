Pioneer Anomaly: An Interesting Numerical Coincidence

Introduction

It is a pleasure and a priviledge to be a physicist nowadays. We are living an era of new and interesting observations which will be likely to boost a profound change in our physical world view. Quite a few of these new observations are related to gravitation and astrophysics. In short, the new observational results suggest that our current theories of gravitation may need a considerable revision, especially as it comes to the properties of very weak gravitational fields. So far it has been generally believed that the good old Newtonian theory of gravity would provide an adequate description of the properties of gravity, when the gravitational interaction is very weak, and the speeds of the gravitating bodies very low. After all, Newton's theory of gravitation is the weak field limit of Einstein's general theory of relativity. According to some current observations, however, this may not be the case. Bodies in very weak gravitational fields seem to behave in a way different from the one predicted by Newton's universal law of gravitation.

One of the most interesting new observations is the so called Pioneer anomaly [\cite=yksi] [\cite=kaksi]. The spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 were launched in the years 1972 and 1973, respectively, to probe the outer reaches of our solar system. Ever since their trajectories have been tracked with a very great precision. Improved observational techniques, together with a detailed analysis of the observational data, revealed during the 90's that, in addition to the gravitational acceleration predicted by Newton's universal law of gravitation, those spacecrafts possess a certain unexplained, anomalous acceleration towards the Sun. Nowadays there is a general agreement that the magnitude of this anomalous acceleration is [\cite=yksi]

[formula]

Although this acceleration is very small -it is about the same as is the gravitational acceleration caused by a 10 kg mass at the 1 meter distance- there is no doubt that the Pioneer anomaly is real. So far the Pioneer anomaly has escaped all attempted explanations based on the known physics. The most plausible explanation offered so far has been an asymmetric leakage of heat from the spacecraft [\cite=kolme]. Other attempted explanations include, among other things, the drag of interplanetary dust [\cite=nelja], and the gravitational attraction of the objects of the Kuiper belt [\cite=viisi]. All these explanations, except the asymmetric leakage of heat, which is still under scrutiny, however, have failed in the close examination. Even the attempts to explain the Pioneer anomaly by means of modifications of the current theories of gravity meet with a considerable difficulty: Observations made on the motions of the outer planets strongly suggest that the planets do not possess any anomalous accelerations but they move strictly according to the laws of classical physics [\cite=kuusi]. So if we want to explain the Pioneer anomaly by means of a new theory of gravity, that theory should predict new effects for the motions of objects whose masses are of the order of 100 kg, which is the order of magnitude of the masses of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11, and leave intact the predictions of the Newtonian theory of gravity as it comes to the motions of the planetary objects. A very great challenge, indeed!

The purpose of this paper is to sketch a new type of explanation for the Pioneer anomaly. Our starting point is a certain curious numerical coincidence: If we construct from the anomalous acceleration aP of Eq.(1.1), Newton's gravitational constant G  ≈  6.673  ×  10- 11Nm2 / kg2, and the proton rest mass mp  ≈  1.6725  ×  10- 27kg a quantity

[formula]

which has the same dimension as length, we get:

[formula]

Curiously, this quantity, which we shall christen as the "Pioneer length" is roughly of the same order of magnitude as is the Compton wave length of the proton:

[formula]

Indeed, the quantities [formula] and λC differ from each other only by a factor of nine.

The fact that the quantities [formula] and λC are so surprisingly close to each other naturally begs for an explanation, especially since the mass of a spacecraft consists, almost exclusively, of the masses of its protons and neutrons, which are about the same. One may view the relationship between [formula] and λC as a relationship between the anomalous acceleration aP and the proton mass mp. It is extremely exciting that this relationship between aP and mp involves the Planck constant h. An unexpected appearance of h in this relationship makes an idea that quantum effects may play some role in the Pioneer anomaly almost impossible to resist. Indeed, if the Pioneer anomaly does not find a more mundane explanation within the context of classical physics during the next few years, one might almost begin to feel tempted to suspect, whether the Pioneer anomaly might be a consequence of some subtle quantum effect of gravity.

The basic idea of this paper is to approach the Pioneer anomaly by means of a concept which we shall call, for the sake of brevity and simplicity, an acceleration surface. Loosely speaking, acceleration surface may be defined as a spacelike two-surface of spacetime accelerating uniformly to the direction of its normal. The simplest possible example of an acceleration surface is a flat spacelike two-plane in flat Minkowski spacetime accelerating to the direction of its normal. Other examples include, among other things, a spherical two-surface with a constant Schwarzschild coordinate r in Schwarzschild spacetime.

When matter flows through an acceleration surface, it interacts with the geometry of the surface. As a result, the area of the acceleration surface will change in a certain manner. The area change as a function of the proper time τ measured by an observer at rest with respect to the acceleration surface depends on the energy momentum stress tensor Tμν of the matter, and may be calculated by using Einstein's field equation. Quite recently, it has been shown that the converse is also true: If one assumes that the area of an acceleration surface depends, as a function of the proper time τ, on the tensor Tμν in a a certain manner, one may derive Einstein's field equation [\cite=seitseman] [\cite=kahdeksan]. In other words, one may reduce Einstein's general relativity with all of its consequences to the properties of acceleration surfaces. The idea that one could reduce classical general relativity to the behavior of certain spacelike two-surfaces when matter flows through those surfaces is far from new: It was shown already in 1995 by Jacobson that one may obtain Einstein's field equation by assuming that when matter flows through a finite part of a local Rindler horizon of an accelerating observer, then that part shrinks such that the amount of entropy carried by matter through that part is, in natural units, exactly one-quarter of the decrease in its area [\cite=yhdeksan]. In a sense, the result that one may obtain classical general relativity from the assumed properties of acceleration surfaces is just an outgrowth and a generalization of Jacobson's results.

The fact that classical general relativity may be reduced to the properties of acceleration surfaces gives a rise to an idea to use those properties as a new, fresh starting point for the attempts to quantize gravity. In these attempts the Pioneer anomaly might provide useful observational guidance. The acceleration surfaces presumably have some quantum mechanical properties, and these properties should explain, among other things, the Pioneer anomaly.

In this paper we formulate a certain general hypothesis concerning the quantum mechanical properties of acceleration surfaces. Our hypothesis implies, among other things, that protons and neutrons gain, outside of the influence of the heavy planets, towards the Sun an anomalous acceleration, which is about the same as is the acceleration aP of Eq.(1.1). Since the masses of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 consist almost exclusively of the masses of their protons and neutrons, our hypothesis provides an explanation to the Pioneer anomaly: The quantum mechanical properties of acceleration surfaces give a certain acceleration for protons and neutrons, and since spacecrafts are made of protons and neutrons, they get that same acceleration.

We begin our discussion in Section 2 by defining properly the concept of acceleration surface, and we consider its properties. Among other things, we shall show that for an acceleration surface it is possible to define, from the point of view of an observer at rest with respect to the surface, a quantity which we shall call as the heat change of the surface, and which is proportional to the change in its area. It turns out that this quantity has an interesting property that if the matter initially at rest with respect to an acceleration surface in its immediate vicinity flows through the surface from its one to its other side, then the energy transported by the matter through the surface is always, at least under certain fairly general conditions posed for the matter fields, of the same order of magnitude as is the negative of the corresponding heat change of the surface. In other words, some amount of the thermal energy of the acceleration surface has been converted to the energy of the matter flowing through the surface. We may use this result when we estimate the area change of an acceleration surface when particles of matter (protons, for example) are carried through the surface.

In Section 3 we formulate in details our hypothesis concerning the quantum mechanical properties of acceleration surfaces. To put it simply, our hypothesis states that certain acceleration surfaces may absorb elementary particles by means of quantum mechanical processes such that when an acceleration surface absorbs a particle, the resulting increase in the area of the surface is about the same as is the area occupied by the particle on that surface. Since the quantum mechanical "size" of an elementary particle is, in a certain sense, given by its Compton wave length λC, we may approximate the area occupied by an elementary particle on an acceleration surface by the surface area of a sphere having the Compton wave length λC of the particle as its radius. Our hypothesis immediately implies, together with the results obtained in Section 2, that the "Pioneer length" [formula] of Eq.(1.2) is about the same as is the Compton wave length λC of the proton. Our hypothesis also tells the direction of the anomalous acceleration gained by elementary particles in a gravitational field.

We close our discussion in Section 4 with some concluding remarks.

Acceleration Surfaces and Their Properties

Quite recently it has been found that Einstein's field equation, and thereby the whole classical gravity, may be obtained from the properties of the so called acceleration surfaces [\cite=seitseman] [\cite=kahdeksan]. To put it simply, acceleration surface is a spacelike two-surface of spacetime, which is in a uniformly accelerating motion to the direction of its normal. More precisely, an acceleration surface is defined as a smooth, orientable, spacelike two-surface of spacetime such that the proper acceleration vector field aμ of the congruence of the timelike world lines of its points has the property

[formula]

and there exists a spacelike unit normal vector field nμ for the surface such that

[formula]

In other words, the absolute value a of the proper acceleration is identically constant everywhere and all the time on an acceleration surface. The world lines of the points of an acceleration surface are parametrized by the proper time τ measured along these world lines, and this proper time gives the same time coordinate for every point on the surface, i.e. acceleration surfaces are specific τ = constant two-surfaces of spacetime.

The simplest possible example of an acceleration surface is a flat, spacelike two-plane in flat, four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with a constant proper acceleration a to the direction of its spacelike unit normal. As another example we may consider a spacelike two-sphere r = constant in Schwarzschild spacetime equipped with a Schwarzschild metric

[formula]

The only non-zero component of the future directed unit tangent vector field uμ of the world lines of the two-sphere under consideration is

[formula]

and the two-sphere has a spacelike unit normal vector field nμ, whose only non-zero component is

[formula]

Hence the only non-zero component of the proper acceleration vector field aμ: = uαuμ;α is

[formula]

which means that all points of the two-sphere have all the time the same constant proper acceleration

[formula]

to the direction of the vector nμ. In other words, the two-sphere r = constant indeed is an acceleration surface.

The main motivation for defining the concept of acceleration surface is that acceleration surfaces are very similar to the event horizons of black holes: According to the zeroth law of black hole mechanics the surface gravity κ is constant everywhere and all the time on a black hole event horizon, whereas on an acceleration surface the proper acceleration a is constant. Moreover, black hole event horizon may always be regarded as as an asymptotic limit of a certain acceleration surface, when the proper acceleration a on that acceleration surface goes to infinity. For example, one may observe from Eq.(2.7) that in the limit, where a  →    ∞   on the two- sphere r = constant, r must approach 2M, the Schwarzschild radius of the Schwarzschild black hole. In other words, the acceleration surface r = constant becomes to the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole in the limit, where a  →    ∞  .

Acceleration surfaces have certain very interesting thermodynamical properties, which are very similar to those of black hole event horizons. For instance, according to a distant observer a black hole event horizon with a surface gravity κ has the Hawking temperature [\cite=kymmenen]

[formula]

whereas an observer at rest with respect to an acceleration surface observes thermal radiation, whose temperature is the so called Unruh temperature [\cite=yksitoista]

[formula]

even when, according to all inertial observers, all matter fields are in vacuum. We may regard the Unruh temperature TU as the temperature of an acceleration surface in the same sense as the Hawking temperature TH may be regarded as the temperature of a black hole event horizon.

If we accept the view that acceleration surfaces, in the same way as black hole event horizons, have a certain temperature, we are forced to conclude that an acceleration surface possesses, from the point of view of an observer at rest with respect to the surface, a certain amount of heat. As it is well known, variations of the surface gravity κ and the area A of a black hole event horizon have the following property [\cite=kaksitoista]:

[formula]

Since 1 / 4δA is the change in the entropy of the horizon, and κ / (2π) is its Hawking temperature, the thermodynamical relation δQ  =  T  dS implies that the heat change of a black hole event horizon is

[formula]

Analogies between acceleration surfaces and black hole event horizons therefore suggest that if the area A of an acceleration surface experiences a change ΔA, then the corresponding change in the heat content of the acceleration surface is:

[formula]

or, in SI units:

[formula]

The last equality in Eq.(2.12) follows from the assumption that a is kept constant during the process, where the area A changes. When we calculate the change ΔA in the area A of an acceleration surface, we follow the world lines of the points of the surface, and we parametrize the world lines by the proper time τ measured along those world lines. By the change ΔA of the area A we mean the change in the area of the surface τ = constant, when τ is changed.

There are good grounds to believe that the quantity ΔQas of Eq.(2.13) really describes the change in the heat content of an acceleration surface. For instance, it may be shown that Einstein's field equation with a vanishing cosmological constant may be obtained for general matter fields from an equation [\cite=seitseman]

[formula]

provided that

[formula]

In Eq.(2.14) [formula] means the flow of heat (heat flown during a unit proper time) carried by massless, noninteracting radiation through an acceleration surface of spacetime, and [formula] denotes the rate of change in this heat flow. Since Eq.(2.14) implies Einstein's field equation, and therefore the whole classical general relativity with all of its consequences, we may view Eq.(2.14) as a fundamental equation in the thermodynamics of spacetime. Although Eq.(2.14) has been written for massless, noninteracting radiation only, it may be used for general matter fields: If the acceleration surface is assumed to move, when τ = 0, with a velocity very close to that of light with respect to the matter fields, the kinetic energies of the particles of the fields vastly exceed the other forms of energies, and we may consider matter, from the point of view of an observer at rest with respect to the acceleration surface, in effect, as a gas of non-interacting massless particles [\cite=kahdeksan].

It is interesting to consider the special case, where an acceleration surface is at rest with respect to the radiation, when τ = 0. This means that

[formula]

and therefore we may write ΔQrad, the amount of heat carried by radiation through the acceleration surface during a proper time interval

[formula]

A Hypothesis

So far we have learned that with acceleration surfaces, which are somewhat analogous to the event horizons of black holes, it is possible to associate the concept of heat change. Classical gravity as a whole may be formulated in terms of the heat exchange between an acceleration surface, and the matter which flows through that surface. When an acceleration surface is originally at rest with respect to the matter fields, and then begins to move with respect to the matter, the energy carried by the matter through the acceleration surface during a very short proper time interval is, at least under certain conditions, of the same order of magnitude as is the heat lost by the acceleration surface. When matter consists of massless, non-interacting radiation, the amount of energy carried by the matter, and the heat lost by the acceleration surface, are exactly the same.

Since acceleration surfaces seem to play so central role in classical gravity, one is prompted to consider their possible role in quantum gravity. Could acceleration surfaces provide a new, fresh starting point for the attempts to quantize gravity? In particular, is it possible to explain, by means of acceleration surfaces and their possible quantum mechanical properties, the curious numerical coincidence of Eqs.(1.3) and (1.4) between the anomalous acceleration aP of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 towards the Sun, and the Compton wavelength λC of the proton?

To approach this question, consider a particle (proton, for example) lying on an acceleration surface, originally at rest with respect to that surface. After a very short elapsed proper time measured by an observer moving along with the acceleration surface the particle has entered through the surface. According to the results of the previous Section our acceleration surface shrinks in this process such that the resulting decrease in the heat content of the surface is about the same as is the energy of the particle. In other words, it appears for an observer at rest with respect to the acceleration surface as if the acceleration surface had emitted a particle with a certain energy such that some amount of the energy of the acceleration surface is converted to the energy of the particle. If we consider acceleration surfaces as quantum mechanical objects, an emission of a particle by an acceleration surface must correspond to a certain transition from a one to another quantum state of the acceleration surface. The results obtained from loop quantum gravity [\cite=kolmetoista], as well as from the investigations concerning the quantum mechanical properties of the event horizons of black holes [\cite=neljatoista], suggest that for an acceleration surface it is possible to define an area operator, which has a discrete spectrum. Since acceleration surfaces shrink during emissions of particles, it is natural to think that an emission of a particle by an acceleration surface corresponds to a quantum mechanical transition performed by the acceleration surface from a one to another area eigenstate.

Now, if we really consider the processes, where a particle comes through an acceleration surface as quantum mechanical emission processes of particles by the acceleration surface, we are faced with a possibility that an acceleration surface may, in addition of emitting, also absorb particles as well. In other words, it may be possible that an acceleration surface "catches" a particle originally moving along a geodesic of spacetime and, as a result, the particle begins to move along with the acceleration surface with a proper acceleration equal to that of the surface. This means that a particle originally in a free fall may suddenly gain a certain non-zero proper acceleration, even when it has no interactions, except gravity, with the other particles of spacetime. Classically, such a process is impossible, and if the process described above really exists, it must be of a quantum mechanical origin. An absorption of a particle by an acceleration surface is a process inverse to that of emission, and therefore an acceleration surface performs, during an absorption of a particle, a quantum mechanical transition from a lower to a higher area eigenstate.

The absorption process of a particle by an acceleration surface may provide a possible explanation to the Pioneer anomaly: The protons and the neutrons of a spacecraft are absorbed by an acceleration surface possessing a proper acceleration aP towards the Sun, and therefore the spacecraft gains an anomalous additional acceleration aP. This kind of an explanation to the Pioneer anomaly, however, gives a rise to several questions: Why are the protons and the neutrons of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 absorbed by an acceleration surface, which is accelerating towards the Sun? Why are they not absorbed by acceleration surfaces, which are in accelerating motions in other directions? For instance, why are they not absorbed by an acceleration surface, which is accelerating outwards from the Sun? Moreover, why is the proper acceleration aP of the acceleration surface which captures the protons and the neutrons of the Pioneer spacecrafts, about 8.7  ×  10- 10m / s2? Why is it not, say, 9.8m / s2? Is there any physical principle which would determine both the directions and the magnitudes of the proper accelerations of those acceleration surfaces, which absorb the given types of particles?

We first consider the question of the direction of the proper acceleration. To this end, we first define the concepts of negative, positive and zero acceleration surfaces. By zero acceleration surface Σ0 we mean an acceleration surface, where the proper acceleration is zero. In other words, all points of a zero acceleration surface are in a free fall, and thereby they move along timelike geodesics of spacetime.

It should be clear that for any acceleration surface Σ there exists, in an arbitrary moment τ0 of the proper time τ measured along the world lines of the points of the surface, a zero acceleration surface Σ0 such that the points of the acceleration surface Σ, as well as the four-velocities uμ of those points, coincide with those of the zero acceleration surface Σ0: At the moment τ  =  τ0 one just releases all points of the acceleration surface Σ into a free fall, and so one gets the zero acceleration surface Σ0. For the sake of brevity and simplicity we say that the zero acceleration surface Σ0 matches with the acceleration surface Σ, when τ  =  τ0.

We are now prepared to define the concepts of negative and positive acceleration surfaces: An acceleration surface Σ- (Σ+) is a negative (positive) acceleration surface, if at any moment τ  =  τ0 the surface Σ- (Σ+) and the zero acceleration surface Σ0 matching with Σ- (Σ+) have the following properties:

(i) The world lines of the points of the surface Σ- (Σ+) never intersect the world lines of the points of the surface Σ0 for any τ  >  τ0.

(ii) There exists a proper time interval Δτ > 0 such that if we pick up any open subset S- (S+), which becomes an open subset S0 of Σ0 when τ  =  τ0, then the area A- (A+) of S- (S+) is smaller (greater) than the area A0 of S0 for all τ∈(τ0,τ0  +  Δτ).

It should be noted that the proper time τ on the zero acceleration surface Σ0 as well as on the surface Σ- (Σ+) has been measured along the world lines of the points of the surfaces such that when the surface Σ0 matches with the surface Σ- (Σ+), the proper time τ  =  τ0 on the both surfaces. In essence, our definition of negative and positive acceleration surfaces just says that if we pick up, in any moment τ0 of the proper time τ, any part of a negative (positive) acceleration surface, then immediately after the moment τ0 the area of that part is smaller (greater) than it would have been, if the points of that part would have been released in a free fall.

It is very easy to give examples of negative, positive and zero acceleration surfaces. For instance, it is straightforward to show that in Schwarzschild spacetime those spacelike two-spheres, where the radial coordinate r obeys for all r an equation

[formula]

where the dot means proper time derivative, are in a free fall, and therefore they are zero acceleration surfaces. A two-sphere, whose points are in a uniformly accelerating motion with a constant proper acceleration in the direction of the spacelike normal of the sphere such that [formula] for all r, are negative acceleration surfaces, whereas those two-spheres, where [formula] for all r, are positive acceleration surfaces. Indeed, if we pick up any part of a two-sphere, where [formula] ([formula]) for all r, then the area of that part is, immediately after any instant τ0 of the proper time τ, smaller (greater) than it would have been, if the points of that part would have been released in a free fall, when τ  =  τ0.

The spacetime geometry, where the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 move is, at least as an excellent approximation, a Schwarzschild geometry created by the mass of the Sun. Since the spacecrafts seem to have a certain constant, anomalous acceleration aP towards the Sun, it appears that they move along with certain negative acceleration surfaces with a proper acceleration aP. In other words, it seems as if the protons and the neutrons of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 had undergone a quantum mechanical absorption process performed by a certain negative acceleration surface. It is tempting to speculate on the possibility that this is a general feature of negative acceleration surfaces: Negative acceleration surfaces tend to absorb elementary particles. At least such a hypothesis would explain the direction of the anomalous acceleration experienced by the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11.

Although our hypothesis seems to explain the direction of the anomalous acceleration aP, it does not, however, explain its magnitude. It is natural to think that those quantum-mechanical absorption processes performed by negative acceleration surfaces would be favored, where the corresponding increase in the area of the acceleration surface is roughly of the same order of magnitude as is the "surface area" of the particle which is being absorbed. The order of magnitude in the increase in the area of an acceleration surface may be calculated by means of Eqs. (2.13) and (2.20) such that we substitute for ΔE the mass energy mc2 of the particle with mass m. The "radius" of the particle, in turn, may be described, in a quantum mechanical sense, by its Compton wave length [formula]. If we know the "radius" of the particle, we may estimate its effective "surface area".

We now condense all of the speculations we have expressed so far on the possible quantum mechanical properties of acceleration surfaces into the following hypothesis, which at the very least seems to explain the Pioneer anomaly:

Negative acceleration surfaces of spacetime tend to absorb those elementary particles which have the property that the surface area of a sphere with a radius equal to the Compton wave length of the particle is of the same order of magnitude as is the area increase caused by the absorption of the particle by the acceleration surface.

We have already seen, how this hypothesis explains the direction of the anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer spacecrafts. To see how it explains its magnitude as well, consider Eq.(2.20). If we take ΔE to be the mass energy mc2 of a particle with mass m we find, using Eq.(2.13), that the increase in the area A of a negative acceleration surface during an absorption of the particle is:

[formula]

According to our hypothesis ΔA is of the same order of magnitude as is the surface area of a sphere with a radius equal to the Compton wave length of the particle. This implies:

[formula]

Comparing Eqs.(3.2) and (3.3) we therefore find:

[formula]

In other words, we have found that the curious numerical relationship, which was discovered in the Introduction between the Compton wave length of the proton, the proton mass, and the anomalous acceleration of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11, is of general validity, provided that our hypothesis is true: Our hypothesis implies that elementary particles with mass m receive in a gravitational field an anomalous acceleration a to the direction of a spacelike normal of a negative acceleration surface of spacetime such that Eq.(3.4) holds. According to our hypothesis this effect is of a purely quantum mechanical origin, and it cannot be explained by means of classical physics.

Using Eq.(3.4) we may obtain a very rough order-of-magnitude estimate for the anomalous acceleration a received by an elementary particle with mass m:

[formula]

If our hypothesis is true, this expression should give, up to a numerical coefficient of the order of unity, the correct value for the anomalous acceleration a. To find the precise value of that numerical coefficient, we should carry out a detailed quantum mechanical calculation which, unfortunately, is out of reach at the moment. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that if we define a quantity

[formula]

we get, if we substitute for m the proton mass mp  ≈  1.6725  ×  10- 27kg:

[formula]

which is well within the error bars of the observed anomalous acceleration aP of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have found that the Pioneer anomaly may be explained by means of a very simple quantum mechanical hypothesis concerning the properties of the so called acceleration surfaces of spacetime. Loosely speaking, acceleration surface may be defined as a spacelike two-surface of spacetime accelerating uniformly to the direction of its spacelike normal. According to our hypothesis certain acceleration surfaces, which we called negative acceleration surfaces, absorb elementary particles by means of a still unknown quantum mechanical process such that when a negative acceleration surface absorbs an elementary particle, the resulting increase in the area of the surface is about the same as is the area occupied by the absorbed particle on the surface. The area occupied by an elementary particle on an acceleration surface, in turn, may be estimated, at least as far as we are interested in mere order-of-magnitude approximations, by the surface area of a sphere having the Compton wave length of the particle as its radius. Our hypothesis implied, among other things, that elementary particles with mass m gain towards the Sun a certain anomalous acceleration, which depends on the mass m. Using our hypothesis we managed to find, up to a still unknown numerical factor of order unity, an explicit expression for that acceleration. If the numerical factor in question is chosen to be [formula], and we substitute for the mass m the proton mass mp, we get for the anomalous acceleration a value, which is well within the error bars of the observed anomalous acceleration aP of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 towards the Sun. Since the masses of those spacecrafts consist mainly of the masses of their protons and neutrons, our hypothesis seems to be capable to explain the Pioneer anomaly: The protons and the neutrons of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 are absorbed by a certain acceleration surface, and therefore the spacecrafts get a certain anomalous acceleration towards the Sun.

The observational data gained so far provides some reasons to believe that, in contrast to the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11, the outer planets of our solar system do not possess any anomalous acceleration towards the Sun, but they do move according to the well established laws of classical gravity. If this conclusion drawn from the observational data is correct, it may also be explained by our hypothesis based on the concept of acceleration surface: The outer planets are very heavy objects. Their masses are more than 1025kg, whereas the masses of the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 are less than 103kg. Beacuse of that, the gravitational field created by an outer planet dominates over the gravitational field created by the Sun very far away from the planet. A simple calculation based on Newton's universal law of gravitation reveals that the gravitational field of a planet with mass 1025kg at the distance 10 AU from the Sun dominates over the gravitational field created by the Sun up to the distances of several million kilometers from the planet, whereas the gravitational fields created by the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11 are, when compared to the gravitational field created by the Sun, almost negligible even in their immediate vicinities. So it appears that the negative acceleration surface which accelerates towards the Sun with the proper acceleration aP lies very far away from a planet, whereas it lies in an immediate vicinity of a spacecraft. As a consequence, the protons and the neutrons of the spacecraft are absorbed by that acceleration surface, whereas those of a planet are not, and so the planet moves according to the laws of classical gravity. In a sense, the huge gravitational field created by the planet protects its protons and neutrons from the quantum effects occuring in the gravitational field created by the Sun.

Even though our hypothesis seems to be capable to explain the magnitude of the anomalous acceleration experienced by the spacecrafts Pioneer 10 and 11, together with the absence of any observed anomalous acceleration of the outer planets, it may also have some problems of its own. These potential problems are related to the direction of the anomalous acceleration. The key problem is, whether the requirement that elementary particles are absorbed by negative acceleration surfaces only, is enough to specify that direction. In flat Minkowski spacetime, for instance, one may construct in a neighbourhood of any point a negative acceleration surface, where the proper acceleration vector field aμ points to an arbitrary spacelike direction of spacetime: One just associates shrinking spheres with the given point. What determines which negative acceleration surface the elementary particle begins to follow? If our hypothesis is correct, elementary particles may gain a certain anomalous acceleration in any direction in flat spacetime. Why do we not observe in flat spacetime bodies made of protons and neutrons mysteriously accelerating in arbitrary directions?

The answer to this problem lies in the symmetries of flat spacetime. Flat spacetime looks exactly the same in all spatial directions, and therefore the elementary particles in flat spacetime are absorbed by negative acceleration surfaces accelerating in different directions with equal probabilities. Since the probability of being accelerated to the given direction is the same for all directions, there is, as a net effect, no acceleration at all in any direction. Hence we do not observe anomalous accelerations for bodies in flat spacetime. If spacetime is curved, however, the spatial symmetries of flat spacetime are broken. For instance, if we look at Schwarzschild spacetime from a point different from the origin, we may observe that spacetime looks different in different directions. As a result, absorption of an elementary particle by a negative acceleration surface accelerating in a certain direction becomes more probable than being absorbed by surfaces accelerating in other directions. As a net effect we may observe particles and bodies propagating in curved spacetime with certain anomalous accelerations. It will be an interesting research project of the future to investigate how the probability distribution associated with the directions of anomalous accelerations depends on the large scale geometry of spacetime. The final aim of such a project is to find out, whether anomalous accelerations for bodies in an free fall could be observed even in laboratory conditions, provided that the spacetime geometry is sufficiently asymmetric. If our hypothesis is correct, one expects to be able to observe for bodies in a free fall in a laboratory, in addition to the ordinary gravitational acceleration caused by Earth's gravity, an anomalous acceleration, which is of the order of 10- 9m / s2, and is caused by the quantum effects of gravity.

Boost Energy Flow and Heat Change

In this Appendix we shall show that Eq.(2.20) holds at least when spacetime geomerty and the matter distribution are homegenous and isotropic in a (small) region of spacetime under consideration, there are no negative pressures, and the matter satisfies the dominant energy condition.

Our starting point is an equation

It has been pointed out by Baez that this equation summarizes the geometric content of Einstein's field equation [\cite=viisitoista]. In this equation V denotes the three-volume of a very small three-dimensional spatial region of spacetime. The dot denotes the proper time derivative from the point of view of an observer in a free fall, and we have assumed that

where k = 1,2,3, are the pressure components. Hence we may write Eq.(A.1) as:

[formula]

Since the matter distribution is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, we have

[formula]

and the dominant energy condition, together with the non-negativity of the pressure, implies [\cite=kaksitoista]:

[formula]

So we find that Eq.(A.1) takes finally the form:

[formula]

We may assume that matter is at rest with respect to our system of coordinates.

At this point we note that since, in addition to the matter fields, the spacetime geometry is also assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, the spatial region of spacetime under consideration expands and contracts in the same ways in all spatial directions. So we find that if we pick up from spacetime an acceleration surface at rest with respect to our system of coordinates, when τ = 0, Eq.(A.2) implies:

[formula]

where A is the area of the acceleration surface. Because the area A scales as the power 2/3 of the volume V, we observe:

[formula]

and so Eq.(A.8) implies that

[formula]

when τ = 0. After a very short proper time interval τ we therefore find that the area of the acceleration surface has experienced the change

[formula]

and the heat content of the surface the change

[formula]

where a is the proper acceleration of our acceleration surface.

Consider now the flow of energy through the acceleration surface. In general, the boost energy flow (boost energy flown during a unit time) through a very small spacelike two-surface with area A is

[formula]

where uμ is the future directed unit tangent vector of the world line of the surface, and nμ is a spacelike unit normal vector of the surface. If the surface is in a uniformly accelerating motion to the direction of the vector nμ with a proper acceleration a, the vectors uμ and nμ transform to the vectors during a short proper time interval τ. In Eq.(A.15) we have assumed that aτ  ≪  1, and therefore we have neglected the terms non-linear in τ. If we replace the vectors uμ and nμ in Eq.(A.14) by the vectors u'μ and n'μ of Eq.(A.15), we find that if Tμν is a very slowly varying function of the proper time τ, the rate of change of the boost energy through the surface is, when τ = 0:

[formula]

For instance, if our surface is a very small acceleration surface, which is originally at rest with respect to our orthonormal geodesic system of coordinates, and is then accelerated to the direction of the z-axis, the only non-vanishing component of the vector uμ is

[formula]

and the only non-vanishing component of the vector nμ is

[formula]

at the moment, when τ = 0. So we observe from Eq.(A.16) that the rate of change of the boost energy flow to the direction of the negative z-axis is

[formula]

which, by means of Eqs.(A.3) and (A.4), implies:

[formula]

Since our matter distribution is assumed to be isotropic, we finally get:

[formula]

At this point we employ the crucial assumption that our accleration surface is at rest with respect to our system of coordinates, and therefore also with respect to the matter, when τ = 0. This means that when τ = 0, the boost energy flow through the surface vanishes. In other words, we have:

[formula]

Hence we may write the boost energy flown during a very small proper time interval τ through our acceleration surface as a Taylor expansion:

[formula]

and Eq.(A.21) implies:

[formula]

We may now compare the quantity ΔEmatter of Eq.(A.24), which tells the amount of boost energy flown through our acceleration surface during a very short proper time interval τ, to the quantity ΔQas of Eq.(A.13), which tells the heat change of our accleration surface during that proper time interval. We get, for very small τ:

[formula]

Since the pressure p is assumed to be non-negative, and to satisfy Eq.(A.7), the dominant energy condition, we may write ΔEmatter in the form:

[formula]

where the number α has the property:

[formula]

So we find that, indeed, ΔEmatter is of the same order of magnitude as -  ΔQas, or:

[formula]

at least under the assumptions made at the beginning of this Appendix. In other words, we have obtained Eq.(2.20).

Of particular interest is the special case, where the spacetime region under consideration is filled with non-interacting, homogeneous dust. In that case Eq.(A.25) implies:

[formula]

which is Eq.(2.21). Another interesting special case is the one, where matter consists of massless, non-interacting radiation. In that case it turns out that the boost energy flow is exactly the heat flow carried by the radiation, and

[formula]

Eq.(A.25) implies:

[formula]

In other words, the heat of the acceleration surface is exactly converted to the boost energy, or heat, of the radiation.
