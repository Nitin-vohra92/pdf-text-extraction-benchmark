On a problem of Juhász and van Mill

Introduction

Every compact Hausdorff dense in itself topological space contains a countable subset which is dense in itself [\cite=JvM]. A space is countably compact if each countably infinite subset of that space has a cluster point. Tkaenko [\cite=Tka] asked whether every regular countably compact dense in itself topological space contains a countable subset which is dense in itself. This was answered in the negative by Juhász and van Mill [\cite=JvM], who concluded their paper with the following.

Does there exist a cardinal κ such that every regular dense in itself countably compact topological space has a dense in itself subset of cardinality at most κ?

Despite several efforts made in the past, the problem is still open. We will prove the following. A topological space is scattered if each of its nonempty subsets has an isolated point.

Assume that [formula]. There exists a Hausdorff space S such that:

|S| = λ;

S is dense in itself;

Each subspace of S of cardinality less than the cofinality of λ is scattered; and

S is sequentially compact.

The cardinals satisfying the assumption of the theorem are those of the form [formula]. Note that in this case, [formula]. By the Hausdorff Formula, if [formula], then we have that

[formula]

so for each cardinal κ we can take [formula] (which is regular and greater than κ) to obtain a negative answer to Problem [\ref=jvm] when stated for Hausdorff spaces.

Of course, the original Problem [\ref=jvm] is still interesting. We hope that this paper will revive the interest in this problem.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

For a cardinal λ, let λ* denote the collection of finite sequences of elements of λ, and define a topology on λ* with subbase consisting of the ε-neighborhoods

[formula]

of each η∈λ*, where ε  <  λ.

|λ*| = λ;

λ* is dense in itself;

For each Y  ⊆  λ* with [formula]:

There exists ε  <  λ such that the ε-neighborhoods ε, η∈Y, are pairwise disjoint.

Y is closed and discrete.

Every two disjoint subsets of λ* of cardinality smaller than [formula] can be separated by disjoint open subsets of λ*.

(1) is immediate. To prove (2), note that each η∈λ* is the accumulation point of [formula].

(3a) We claim that for all distinct ν,η∈λ*, there exists εν,η  <  λ such that [formula]. Indeed, if ν and η are incomparable with regards to ⊆  , then we can take εν,η = 0. Otherwise assume that ν  ⊂  η. Then we can take εν,η  =  η(|ν|) + 1.

Assume that [formula]. Define ε  =   sup {εν,η:ν,η∈Y}. As [formula], ε  <  λ and is as required.

(3b) Assume that [formula]. By (3a), Y is discrete. To see that Y is closed, assume that y is in the closure of Y, and apply (3a) to [formula] to see that y∈Y.

(4) follow from (3a), either.

The proof of the forthcoming Proposition [\ref=mainlem] uses weak bases. A weak base of a topological space X is a family of the form [formula] such that:

For each x∈X:

x∈B for all B∈B(x);

For all B1,B2∈B(x), [formula] contains an element of B(x);

For each U  ⊆  X, U is open in X if, and only if, for each x∈U, U contains an element of B(x).

A space X with a weak base [formula] is weakly locally-countable/Hausdorff/regular if, respectively:

For each x∈X, there is a countable element in B(x);

For all x,y∈X, there are disjoint Bx∈B(x),By∈B(y);

X is weakly Hausdorff and all elements of [formula] are closed.

For each weakly locally-countable space X:

X is locally countable; and

If X is weakly regular, then it is Hausdorff.

For the reader's convenience, we reproduce the proofs.

(1) Let x∈X. Set U0  =  {x} and inductively, for each y∈Un choose a countable Dy∈B(y), and set [formula]. Then [formula] is a countable open neighborhood of x.

(2) Let x,y∈X be distinct. By (1), there is a countable open neighborhood U of x,y. Enumerate [formula]. Let U0  =  {x},V0  =  {y}. By induction on n, assume that Un,Vn are disjoint and closed. If xn∈Un, pick B∈B(xn) such that [formula] and let [formula]. Otherwise, pick B∈B(xn) such that [formula] and let [formula].

The sets [formula] are disjoint open neighborhoods of x,y, respectively.

Assume that [formula]. There exists a Hausdorff space X such that:

|X| = λ;

X is locally countable;

X is scattered;

There are λ isolated points in X; and

X is sequentially compact.

This is proved as in Nyikos and Vaughan's "Construction of Xu" [\cite=NyikosVaughan92]. In our case, we should replace [formula] with λ (and use the premise [formula]), need not worry about the ultrafilter u, and verify that there are λ isolated points in X. We give a full direct proof.

The topology is constructed on the space X = λ.

Enumerate [formula], such that Dα  ⊆  α for each α. We construct, inductively on α with ω  ≤  α  ≤  λ, topologies τα on α, starting with α  =  ω and taking the discrete topology τω on ω. (For each n, we set B(n) = {n}.)

When α is a limit ordinal:

Let τα be the topology having [formula] as a base.

When α  =  β + 1 is a successor ordinal:

If Dβ has a cluster point in (β,τβ), set B(β) = {{β}}, and let τα be the topology having [formula] as a base.

If Dβ has no cluster point in (β,τβ), then it is closed and discrete in (β,τβ). Let B(β) be the family of all sets [formula] such that C is a cofinite subset of Dβ. Let τα be the topology on α with weak base given by the families B(γ), γ  <  α. In other words, τα is the topology having as a base the sets U∈τβ as well as the sets U such that: β∈U, [formula], and U contains some member of B(β).

This completes the inductive construction. We take X = λ, with the topology τλ.

For each α, consider the space (α,τα) with the weak base given by the families B(β), β  <  α, defined in the construction. By definition, it is weakly locally countable. We prove that (α,τα) is weakly regular.

The construction is such that open sets remain open in all extensions, and no new relative open sets are added to the already constructed spaces. Thus, sets which are compact at some stage remain compact. At each step, the added weak base elements are either singletons or convergent sequences, and consequently are compact. It thus remains to prove that the spaces are Hausdorff, and this is done by induction. (By Lemma [\ref=alephesH], for spaces with a weak base consisting of countable compact sets, being Hausdorff is equivalent to being weakly regular.)

α  =  ω:

this is evident.

α is a limit ordinal:

If β  <  γ  <  α are distinct, by the induction hypothesis they are separated by disjoint open sets from τγ + 1.

α  =  β + 1 is a successor ordinal:

If Dβ has a cluster point in (β,τβ), then B(β) = {{β}}. For each γ  <  β, the open sets β and {β} are disjoint and contain the points γ and β, respectively. By the induction hypothesis, any two points in β are separated by disjoint open sets. Thus, (α,τα) is Hausdorff.

In the remaining case, where Dβ is closed discrete in (β,τβ), we prove that (α,τα) is weakly regular. Let γ∈β. Then [formula] is discrete in (β,τβ). Take U∈τβ such that γ∈U and [formula]. Let V∈B(γ) be a subset of U. Then V is disjoint from [formula]. Thus, (β,τβ) is weakly Hausdorff.

It remains to show that the elements of the weak base of (α,τα) are closed. Let B∈B(β). [formula] is a cofinite subset of Dβ, and thus [formula]. For γ  <  β, let B∈B(γ). As B is compact and Dβ is closed and discrete in (β,τβ), [formula] is finite. By the induction hypothesis, B is closed in (β,τβ), and therefore [formula], and contains a cofinite subset of Dβ. Thus, [formula].

This completes the proof that X is Hausdorff.

Each nonempty subset A of X has an isolated point: Take α  =   min A. Then α∈α + 1∈τα + 1  ⊆  τλ, and α + 1 is disjoint from [formula].

X has λ many isolated points: Let β  <  λ be such that Dβ  =  ω. For each α  >  β, [formula] is a countable subset of λ which is not a subset of β. Thus, these sets are considered in (successor) stages later than β + 1, where they already have a cluster point. Consequently, in each of these λ many stages, a new isolated point is added.

X is countably compact: Let A be a countable subset of λ. Let β be such that Dβ = A. Then either A has a cluster point in (β,τβ) and thus in X (since β is open in X), or else A converges to β (in (β + 1,τβ + 1) and therefore in X).

X is sequentially compact: This can be proved by quoting basic facts. Indeed, X is countably compact and has a countable weak base at each point. Thus, X is sequential, and therefore sequentially compact.

Alternatively, we can argue directly. Let A be a countable subset of λ. Let β be the minimal cluster point of A. As β is not isolated in X, Dβ converges to β. In (τβ,β), [formula] is closed, and therefore [formula] is open in X. If [formula] is finite, then [formula] is an open neighborhood of β, and [formula], in contradiction to β being a cluster point of A. Thus, [formula] is infinite, and is therefore a subsequence of A converging to β.

Assume that [formula], and let X be as in Lemma [\ref=mainlem]. We may assume that [formula]. We will define the required topology on [formula].

Let I be the set of isolated points of X, and let {Ax:x∈I} be maximal almost disjoint in [formula]. The open sets in the topology of S are those of the form

[formula]

where U is open in X, V is open in λ*, and for each [formula], [formula] is finite. (Note that for [formula], we get that each open set in λ* is also open in S.)

Clearly, |S| = λ.

S is Hausdorff: Consider any distinct x0,x1∈X and any distinct y0,y1∈λ*. We will find disjoint open sets G0,G1 such that xi,yi∈Gi, i = 0,1. X is Hausdorff and locally countable. Take disjoint countable open subsets U0,U1 of X containing x0,x1, respectively. Enumerate [formula]. For each n, define [formula]. Note that Ãxn is a cofinite subset of Axn. By Lemma [\ref=lambda*], there are disjoint open sets V0,V1 in λ* such that

[formula]

i = 0,1. The sets [formula], i = 0,1, are as required.

S is dense in itself: λ* is dense in itself, hence (by the definition of open sets in S) each y∈λ* is an accumulation point in S. Let x∈X. If x is an accumulation point in X, then x is an accumulation point in S. Otherwise, x is in the closure of Ax: Indeed, the sets [formula] where V is open in λ* and [formula] is finite form a neighborhood base at x, and therefore the elements of Ax converge to x.

Each Z  ⊆  S with [formula] is scattered:

Case 1: Z  ⊆  X. As X is scattered, we can find x∈Z isolated in X. Then [formula] is a neighborhood of x in S and is disjoint from [formula].

Case 2: [formula]. [formula]. Thus, [formula] is discrete in λ*. As each open set in λ* is also open in S, we are done.

S is sequentially compact: Assume that [formula]. If [formula] is infinite, then there are x∈X and a subsequence of [formula] converging to x. It is clear that the same subsequence will also converge to x in the topology of S. And if not, then [formula] is infinite. As {Ax:x∈I} is maximal almost disjoint in [formula], there is x∈I such that [formula] is infinite. Being a subsequence of Ax, it converges to x.

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].
