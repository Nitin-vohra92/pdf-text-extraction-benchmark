In some theories the Lagrangians containing higher time derivatives appear naturally. This concerns effective low energy theories, modified theories of gravity or noncommutative field theories. A standard framework for dealing with such theories on hamiltonian level is provided by Ostrogradski formalism [\cite=b1], [\cite=b2], [\cite=b3]. The main disadvantage of the latter is that the Hamiltonian, being linear function of some momenta, is unbounded from below. In general, this cannot be cured by trying to devise an alternative cannonical formalism. In fact, any Hamiltonian is an integral of motion while it is by far not obvious that a generic system described by a higher-derivative Lagrangian posses globally defined integrals of motion except the one related to time translation invariance.

Ostrogradski approach has also some technical disadvantages. There is no straightforward transition from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formalism. On the contrary, one has to introduce first the Lagrange multipliers enforcing the proper relations between some coordinates and the time derivatives of other coordinates; then the Dirac formalism of constrained dynamics is used to construct the Hamiltonian [\cite=b2], [\cite=b3], [\cite=b4].

Ostrogradski approach is based on the idea that the consecutive time derivatives of the initial coordinate form new coordinates, qi  ~  q(i - 1). However, it has been suggested [\cite=b5], [\cite=b6], [\cite=b7] that one can use every second derivative as a new variable, qi  ~  q(2i - 2). In the present note we study this idea in some detail. Following Ref. [\cite=b5] we modify the initial Lagrangian by adding a term which on-shell becomes a total time derivative. It appears that part of new coordinates can be identified with even time derivatives of the initial one. The resulting Lagrangian is nonsingular and the Legendre transformation can be easily performed. The Hamiltonian coincides with the Ostrogradski one while the canonical variables are related to the standard ones by a canonical transformation. The generating function for this transformation is given explicitly.

We start with the Lagrangian depending on time derivatives up to some even order

[formula]

Define new variables

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Let further F be any (at least twice differentiable) function of the following variables

[formula]

obeying

[formula]

and

[formula]

(for n = 1 only (i) remains).

Finally, we define a new Lagrangian

[formula]

Let us have a look on Lagrange equations

[formula]

Using ([\ref=w3]), ([\ref=w4]), ([\ref=w7]) and ([\ref=w8]) one finds

[formula]

However, eqs. ([\ref=w3]), ([\ref=w4]) and ([\ref=w5]) imply that [formula] only for i = n + 1. Therefore, ([\ref=w6]) and ([\ref=w9]) give

[formula]

Let us now consider ([\ref=w8]) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. We find

[formula]

where, by definition [formula]. By combining these equations and using ([\ref=w5]) and ([\ref=w10]) we arrive finally at the initial Lagrange equation

[formula]

Let us now consider the Hamiltonian formalism. Contrary to the Ostrogradski approach the Legendre transformation can be immediately performed; neither additional Lagrange multipliers nor constraints analysis are necessary. In fact, let us define the canonical momenta in a standard way

[formula]

so that

[formula]

By virtue of eqs.([\ref=w5]) and ([\ref=w6]) eqs.([\ref=w14]) can be solved for [formula]

[formula]

Using again eqs.([\ref=w5]) and ([\ref=w6]) we can now solve ([\ref=w15]) for [formula]. Finally, the Hamiltonian is calculated according to the standard prescription.

In order to compare the present formalism with the Ostrogradski approach let us note that they must be related by a canonical transformation. To see this we define new (Ostrogradski) variables k,p̃k,  1  ≤  k  ≤  2n:

[formula]

It is easily seen that the above transformation is a canonical one, i.e. the Poisson brackets are invariant. It is not hard to find the relevant generating function

[formula]

It is also straightforward to check that both Hamiltonians coincide. Moreover, the definitions ()  ÷  () reduce on-shell to the Ostrogradski ones.

Let us now consider the case of Lagrangian depending on time derivatives up to some odd order

[formula]

Again, we define

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Now, let us select a function F,

[formula]

subject to the single condition

[formula]

and define the Lagrangian

[formula]

Consider the Lagrange equations ([\ref=w8]). First, we have

[formula]

and, by virtue of ([\ref=w27])

[formula]

The remaining equations read

[formula]

with [formula]. Combining ([\ref=w30]) and ([\ref=w31]) one gets

[formula]

Let us note that no condition of the form ([\ref=w5]) is here necessary.

Also in the odd case the present formalism is related to that of Ostrogradski by a canonical transformation. Indeed, the canonical momenta read

[formula]

and, as previously, these equations can be solved in terms of velocities, in particular

[formula]

Now, one can define the canonical transformation to Ostrogradski variables

[formula]

The relevant generating function reads

[formula]

Sumarizing, we have found a modified Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of higher-derivative theories. They are equivalent to the Ostrogradski formalism in the sense that on the Hamiltonian level they are related by a canonical transformation. However, the advantage of the approach presented is that the Lagrangian is nonsingular and the Legendre transformation can be performed in a straightforward way.

Let us conclude with the simple example. Consider the Lagrangian [\cite=b6], [\cite=b8], [\cite=b9]

[formula]

and define

[formula]

with F obeying

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=w42]) implies

[formula]

By neglecting total time derivative one obtains by virtue of eqs.([\ref=w41]), ([\ref=w43])

[formula]

It is now straightforward to construct the relevant Hamiltonian

[formula]

and one easily checks that the corresponding canonical equations yield the initial equation for [formula].

The generating function for canonical transformation to Ostrogradski variables reads

[formula]

and gives

[formula]

In terms of new variables the Hamiltonian ([\ref=w45]) reads

[formula]

and coincides with the Ostrogradski Hamiltonian.

Let us note that both Hamiltonians ([\ref=w45]) and ([\ref=w48]) are singular for g = 0 and q1( = 1) = 0. This is due to the fact that in this case the Lagrangian ([\ref=w40]) reduces from second to first order in time derivatives.
