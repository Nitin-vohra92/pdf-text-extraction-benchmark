The 0-  + and 0+  + glueballs and the multiplets including them

Introduction

The existence of glueballs is predicted by QCD, but to day none is definitively established. The main problem is their identification.

There are predictions of lattice QCD simulation [\cite=Lat] for the lowest mass glueball of given signature JPC. For the 0+  + and 0-  + glueballs they are: [formula]   and   [formula].

There are also experimental statements. At present, the f0(1500) and η(1405) mesons are allowed as glueball dominated mixtures with isoscalar q states [\cite=PDG]. The data confirm lattice prediction for the 0+  +, but they drastically disagree with the prediction for the 0-  + glueball. This makes a trouble as people trust the lattice predictions.

Of course, we may look for another field theoretical approach to describe the data. Such description already exists. Faddeev, Niemi and Widner proposed recently a topological model of the glueball as closed flux tube [\cite=Fad]. The model predicts degeneracy of the 0+  + and 0-  + glueball masses and admits the region [formula]GeV, where they are really observed.

However, there is also a problem of exploiting data. Both the f0(1500) and η(1405) have been chosen as glueball candidates from among a few isoscalar mesons on a basis of qualitative information about their production and decay (e.g., "gluon rich environment", or "flavor independence"). Although the predictive and verification power of such procedure is not high, it is the only generally accepted method of the glueball identification. However, such a procedure exploits only part of the accessible data which can be used.

Overpopulation of a nonet is an important signal of the glueball. The glueball should mix with the isoscalar nonet states. All properties of the decuplet which arises this way, including mixing between three isoscalar states, can be described entirely by the masses. Hence, the data on the masses can be used to determine parameters of the glueball.

Exotic commutators and master equations

We assume that the following set of exotic commutators vanishes [\cite=MT]: where Ts are SU(3)F generators, t is time and (α,β) is an exotic combination of indices; that means that Tα, Tβ are chosen such that operator

Spectra of multiplets

The independence of the definition of the multiplet on the widths proves very important for the question of nature of the 0+  + mesons in the 1GeV region. The width argument against their q structure is not valid and there is no need for introducing the four quark states for them [\cite=enc]. Strong suppression of the f0(980) decay is just the manifestation of some ("kinematical") suppression mechanism. Hence, the scalar mesons from the 1GeV region belong to the common q nonet, but the energy dependence of the phases δI = 0J = 0 and δI = 1J = 0 does not reflect the properties of the flavor interaction.

The 0+  + nonet includes [\cite=enc] (f0(1710) is pointed out by the S mass formula): a0(980),  K0(1460),  f0(980),  f0(1710);   (the MOR is:  x1 < a < x2 < b) Other 0+  + mesons (not included into the nonet) constitute the decuplet: a0(1460),  K0(1950),  f0(1370),  f0(1500),  f0(2200) / f0(2330), where f0(1500) is the glueball candidate [\cite=Ams1]. The mass domains of these multiplets overlap, but there is no mixing between their states.

There exists one more meson observed below the mass scales of these two multiplets - the σ(600) one. This meson cannot join the nonet to form a decuplet (compare MORs of the nonet and decuplet).

Also the 0-  + mesons form a nonet and decuplet. Observe, that the old nonet π,  K,  η,   η'   is the only known GMO one. The decuplet comprises [\cite=GMM]:   π(1300),  K(1450),  η(1295),   η(1405),   η(1475), where η(1405) is recognized as glueball candidate [\cite=PDG], [\cite=Ams2].

Hence, both the 0+  + and the 0-  + mesons form the same sequences of multiplets. Some of the masses are not exactly known, but this does not disturb the general picture. Notice, that not only the sequences of the multiplets are similar - also the inner structures of the decuplets are: - the physical mesons f0(1500) and η(1405) which are dominated by glueball states are settled down just between the remaining isoscalar mesons dominated by N and S quark states, - both decuplets are built up of the excited q states, hence both glueballs mix with the excited (q)isoscalar states.

The latter property suggests affinity of the glueball with the excited states. This is suggested especially by the mixing of the 0+  + glueball; its mass belongs to the region where the nonet ground states and the decuplet excited states are overlapping, but the glueball prefers mixing just with the excited q states.

The lack of data does not allow us to extend this comparison to higher masses.

The 0-  + and 0+  + mesons form the parity related multiplets (nonets and decuplets). The sequences of these multiplets differ only due to existence of the scalar meson σ(600) which has no pseudoscalar counterpart. But the nature of this meson is a matter of discussion. Several authors suggest that its nature is different from the nature of other mesons. By abandoning the σ(600) we find that 0-  + and 0+  + mesons form parity related spectra of flavor multiplets.

Glueballs

The masses of the glueballs are:  mG-  + = 1.369GeV and   mG+  + = 1.497GeV. Approximately mG+  + - mG-  + = mπ; in any case [\cite=GMM] they satisfy mG-  + < mG+  +. Clearly, the value of   mG-  +   supports the prediction of the closed flux-tube model [\cite=Fad] and is far from the lattice QCD prediction [\cite=Lat].

Conclusions

1. The mesons f0(1500) and η(1405) can be understood as glueball dominated. 2. The nonet and decuplet states with the same JPC do not mix. 3. The glueballs have affinity to the excited q states. 4. The mesons 0+  + and 0-  + form parallel (parity related) spectra of multiplets. 5. Perhaps the σ(600) meson does not belong to the flavor spectrum of 0+  + multiplets.
