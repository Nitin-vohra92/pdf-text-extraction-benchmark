Introduction

If radiation carries away the energy-momentum from a point like source at the rate Wμ, then the radiation friction force Fμ should appear at the r.h.s. of source's equation of motion,

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] is relativistic velocity of the source, dot denotes derivative w.r.t. the particle self-time τ and fμ is the relativistic force, which causes source's acceleration.

Energy-momentum conservation implies that the work of the radiation friction force should compensate the energy-momentum outflow

[formula]

where the last term at the r.h.s. takes into account the change of the energy-momentum of electromagnetic field in the "near domain" around the source, which is not carried away to infinity, and is a total τ-derivative of an expression ξμ, made from velocity u and its τ-derivatives.

Since

[formula]

the l.h.s. of eq.([\ref=eqm]) is orthogonal to u,

[formula]

and so are relativistic forces at the r.h.s., uμfμ  =  0 and

[formula]

Evaluation of the radiation friction is a tricky task, far more sophisticated than that of Wμ, because it requires separation between the fields in the "near" and "far" (wave) domains and also involves discussion of interaction between the charge and its own field, related to celebrated problems like electromagnetic mass and Poincare tension. Still the force itself is a well defined - and even experimentally measurable - quantity, and one can be interested in knowing the answer for it irrespective of the details of the deep theory. Thus it is natural to search for short-cut ways to calculate radiation friction.

Note that our discussion of the radiation friction is formally applicable equally well for radiation of any spin s. However, for s > 1, the energy-momentum tensor for the point-like source is not conserved. This usually means that one cannot neglect contributions to radiation from tensions of the forces that cause acceleration of the source. Ultimately, it leads to additional contributions into the radiation friction.

Kosyakov's trick

The simplest and the most elegant option [\cite=Kos] is to take the well-known expression for Wμ [\cite=grarad] and to construct an expression for [formula], which satisfies orthogonality condition ([\ref=ortho]), i.e. adjust ξμ to satisfy

[formula]

Unfortunately, as explained below in this section, this trick, while effective in 4 and even in 6 dimensions, appears non-applicable in general, for d  ≥  8.

Let ukl  =  ∂kτuμ∂lτuμ denote scalar bilinears in τ-derivatives of u. Because of ([\ref=u2]) they are not all independent: u0m can be expressed through uk,m - k with 1  ≤  k  ≤  l - 1:

[formula]

The last term in the last formula is present only for even m, square brackets in the upper summation limit in the previous term denote integer part of [formula]. Note in passing that the total number of items in the relation for u0m is 2m - 1; this is because they all arise as multiple derivatives of ([\ref=u2]).

Expression for the radiated energy-momentum in d space-time dimensions (d even) looks as follows [\cite=MM2]:

[formula]

where w(d)m is a polynomial in ukl, a linear combination of Nd - 2 - m monomials [formula] with any r (actually, [formula]) and parameters [formula] constrained by the conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

On dimensional grounds also a term with ∂d - 2τuμ is allowed, but actually it does not contribute to W(d)μ: the coefficient

[formula]

There is no such a restriction in the case of ξ(d)μ, instead it has one dimension less, and

[formula]

with polynomials κ are similar to w, only this time [formula]. It follows that the scalars uμWμ and [formula] are polynomials in ukl with the total number [formula].

In order to check applicability of Kosyakov's trick we need to compare the two numbers:

[formula]

and Nd - 2: the first one counts the total number of monomials, that can  contribute to ξ(d)μ, and the second one counts the number of monomials that can appear in uμWμ and which ξμ is supposed to compensate for according to ([\ref=ortho2]). The trick works if Ñd - 2  =  Nd - 2: then the condition ([\ref=ortho2]) allows one to unambiguously  extract all the coefficients in ([\ref=xiexpan]) from ([\ref=ortho2]) - and this is indeed the case for d = 4 and d = 6. Unfortunately, for higher dimensions the matching breaks down: Ñd - 2  >  Nd - 2 for d  ≥  8, and ξμ is only constrained by ([\ref=ortho2]), some Ñd - 2  -  Nd - 2 coefficients in ξ(d)μ remain undefined, and other methods should be used in order to fix them unambiguously.

The numbers Nk are close relatives of the numbers nk which count natural partitions of k,

[formula]

however, nk would take only ([\ref=sum]) into account, while in the case of Nk an additional constraint ([\ref=consneq]) is imposed and members of every partition should be grouped in pairs:

[formula]

Underlined and under-braced are partitions, contributing to Nk, under-braced are partitions which contribute several  times to Nk.

Generating function of numbers Nk is given by

[formula]

where Nr(q) counts the numbers of polynomials of degree r in ukl. We have:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

and so on. Collecting all terms, we obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

The product [formula] is familiar from the theory of 3d partitions (McMahon), it plays the same role as [formula] from ([\ref=eta]) for ordinary partitions. According to ([\ref=tildeNvsN]) the generating function for the numbers Ñq is equal to

[formula]

The first few numbers Nk are given in the following table, where also the relevant monomials are explicitly listed:

[formula]

It is now easy to find Ñd - 2 and compare them with Nd - 2:

[formula]

For d = 4 we have the exact matching, Ñ2  =  N2  =  1, in more details [\cite=grarad] [\cite=MM2] (here s is the spin of radiation)

[formula]

In the non-relativistic limit, the first term dominates and

[formula]

Similarly, for d = 6 we also have the exact matching, Ñ4  =  N4  =  3, in more details [\cite=Kos] [\cite=MM2]

[formula]

The coefficients here are equal to

[formula]

In the non-relativistic limit, the first term dominates (this is the case in all dimensions!), and

[formula]

In fact, in the expressions above the sign of Wμ was chosen so that it describes correctly all s but s = 0 (scalar). In the latter case, one should reverse the sign. This is because in all but the scalar cases only the spatial components of all non-zero spin fields have any physical meaning (e.g. survive in physical gauges), thus giving rise to the overall minus sign of the kinetic part of the energy-momentum tensor as compared with the scalar case. This means that one should also reverse the sign of ξμ and [formula]. Let us stress again that the results for only s = 0,1 (scalar and electromagnetic radiations) have practical applicability (see the Introduction).

Unfortunately, already for d = 8 the matching fails, Ñ6  =  9   >   N6  =  7. Mismatch does not allow one to define the coefficients in front of 2  =  Ñ6  -  N6 structures, which can potentially contribute to ξ(8)μ, but remain unconstrained by ([\ref=ortho2]). These two structures are:

[formula]

and

[formula]

- it is easy to check that the τ-derivative of any of the two is orthogonal to uμ:

[formula]

Circular motion

The above calculus becomes somewhat different in the special when the source moves along a circular orbit with constant value of velocity, namely when [formula] and thus u0  =  γ do not change with time. The spatial vector [formula] changes direction, but the acceleration is orthogonal to the velocity, [formula], and, as a corollary, all

[formula]

Taking time-derivative of these relations, we obtain

[formula]

for example, [formula]. In addition,

[formula]

for example, [formula]. An immediate corollary of relations ([\ref=ukloddcirc])-([\ref=ukul]) is that both ζ(8,1)μ  =  ζ(8,2)μ  =  0. This means that for circular motion there is no uncertainty and Kosyakov's trick is sufficient to determine the radiation friction unambiguously, at least, for d = 8.

In fact, this is true also for d = 10 and, moreover, for all even dimensions d. In general, we have for circular motion with constant velocity:

[formula]

Numbers Ncirck differ from Nk in the previous tables, because of relations ([\ref=ukloddcirc]) and ([\ref=uklevcirc]). Only bilinear combinations of the last relations ([\ref=ukul]) affect Ncirck, and this happens for the first time for k = 8, i.e. d = 10. Then the square of ([\ref=ukul]) with k,l  =  1,3 implies an additional relation between monomials, which is denoted by

[formula]

Conclusion

Thus, we conclude that the elegant method, successfully used by B.Kosyakov to evaluate the radiation friction force in 4 and 6 space-time dimensions, can not be directly used in general situation in higher dimensions (though it still works nicely for the circular motion with constant angular velocity). Therefore, it seems unavoidable to make full-scale calculations with explicit regularization and counter-terms in the action, as it has been done in 6d in [\cite=regcal]. For first results in this direction beyond 6 dimensions, see [\cite=Gala]. Among interesting questions, appearing on this way, is the counterterms dependence on the choice of regularization (if all counterterms can be varied independently) and physical interpretation of emerging corrections to the naive action of relativistic particle [\cite=DBS].
