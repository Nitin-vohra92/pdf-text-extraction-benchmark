On geometry of gonometric family of cycles

Gonometric family of cycles

Two parametrical family of cycles on the plane is determined by the equation

[formula]

The angle metric in a given family of cycles is defined by the expression [\cite=sur]

[formula]

The expression for the curvature of the metric ([\ref=dr:eq1]) has the form

[formula]

The congruence of cycles of constant curvature

The congruence of cycles of constant curvature K(x,y) = K are defined by the Monge-Ampere equation [\cite=sur]

[formula]

Method of solution

For solutions of the Monge-Ampere equation

[formula]

we use the method of solution of the p.d.e.'s described first in [\cite=heav] and developed later in [\cite=dual] .

This method allow us to construct particular solutions of the partial nonlinear differential equation

[formula]

with the help of transformation of the function and corresponding variables.

Essence of the method consists in a following presentation of the functions and variables

[formula]

where variable t is considered as parameter.

Remark that conditions of the type

[formula]

are fulfilled at the such type of presentation.

In result instead of equation ([\ref=Dr10]) one get the relation between the new variables u(x,t,z),  v(x,t,z) and their partial derivatives

[formula]

This relation coincides with initial p.d.e at the condition v(x,t,z) = t and lead to the new p.d.e

[formula]

when the functions u(x,t,s) = F(ω(x,t,z),ωt...) and v(x,t,s) = Φ(ω(x,t,z),ωt...) are expressed through the auxiliary function ω(x,t,s).

Remark that there are a various means to reduce the relation ([\ref=Dr12]) into the partial differential equation.

In a some cases the solution of equation ([\ref=Dr13]) is a more simple problem than solution of equation ([\ref=Dr10]).

As the example we consider the Monge-Ampere equation

[formula]

After the (u,v)-transformation

[formula]

[formula]

it takes the form of linear equation

[formula]

with general solution

[formula]

depending from two arbitrary functions.

Choice of the functions _Fi and elimination of the parameter t from corresponding relations lead to the function f(x,y) satisfying the Monge-Ampere equation.

Congruence of cycles of zero curvature

In the case K = 0 we get the equation

[formula]

After applying of the (u,v)-transformation at this equation is reduced to the relation

From here after the choice of the functions u and v in the form

[formula]

we find the equation

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

having the particular solution

[formula]

where

[formula]

General solution of this equation is

[formula]

Now elimination of the variable t from the relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

give us the function φ(x,y) defined from the equation

[formula]

satisfying the equation ([\ref=Dr14]).

Congruence of positive constant curvature

In the case K = 1 from ([\ref=dr:eq3]) we get the equation

[formula]

The (u,v)-transformation with condition

[formula]

lead to the equation

[formula]

This equation admits particular solution in the form

[formula]

where the function A(t) is solution of equation

[formula]

So we get

[formula]

Now after elimination of the parameter t from the relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

we obtain the simplest solution of the equation ([\ref=Dr15]).

[formula]

Moore complicated solutions of the equation ([\ref=Dr16]) in the form

[formula]

lead to the conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

is arbitrary function.

In result elimination of the parameter t from the relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

with a given function A(t) we get the solution of the equation ([\ref=Dr15]) dependent from choice of arbitrary function.

As example in the case

[formula]

we find the solution of the equation ([\ref=Dr15]) in the form

[formula]

[formula]

Congruence of negative constant curvature

In the case K =  - 1 from ([\ref=dr:eq3]) we get the equation

[formula]

The (u,v)-transformation with condition

[formula]

lead to the equation

[formula]

This equation admits the particular solution

[formula]

with arbitrary function A(t).

In particular case after elimination of the parameter t from the relations

[formula]

and

[formula]

we find the solution of the equation ([\ref=Dr17]) in the form

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Geodesic equations

The geodesic of the metric ([\ref=dr:eq1]) are equivalent to the equation

[formula]

where

The four-dimensional Riemann extension

The metric ([\ref=dr:eq1]) has a following coefficients of connection

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using given expressions for the connections coefficients we introduce a 4-dimensional Riemann space with the metric

[formula]

where z and t are an additional coordinates.

The Riemann space constructed on such a way is called the Riemann extension of the base space equipped with connection [\cite=weyl].

In explicit form the non zero components of the metric ([\ref=Dr18]) looks as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Remark that two dimensional metric ([\ref=dr:eq1]) at this condition is a flat.

It is important to note that the space with the metric ([\ref=Dr18]) with condition ([\ref=Dr19]) does not a flat, the component R1212 of its Riemann tensor [formula].

So in result of the Riemann extension of the metric ([\ref=dr:eq1]) we have got the Einstein space.

Finally we demonstrate some additional solutions of the equation ([\ref=Dr19]).

The substitution

[formula]

into the equation ([\ref=Dr19]) lead to the condition on the function H(x + y) = H(z)

[formula]

From here we find the function H(z) in non explicit form

[formula]

The substitution

[formula]

lead to the complex solutions.

In additive to the part (2.2) we show the solutions of the the equation ([\ref=Dr19]) (or) which is connected with the function ω(x,t) in form

[formula]

where A(t) is arbitrary function.

In particular case A(t) = t2 from here is followed that the function φ(x,y) defined from the equation

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

is the solution of the equation ([\ref=Dr19]).
