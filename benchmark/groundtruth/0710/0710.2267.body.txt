A Note on the Effective Non-vanishing Conjecture

Lemma Theorem Corollary Conjecture Problem Assumption

Definition

Remark Example

In this note we consider the following so-called effective non-vanishing conjecture, which has been put forward by Ambro and Kawamata [\cite=am] [\cite=ka00].

Let X be a proper normal variety of dimension n, B an effective [formula]-divisor on X such that the pair (X,B) is Kawamata log terminal, and D a Cartier divisor on X. Assume that D is nef and that D - (KX + B) is nef and big. Then H0(X,D)  ≠  0.

This conjecture is closely related to the minimal model program and plays an important role in the classification theory of Fano varieties. For a detailed introduction to this conjecture, we refer the reader to [\cite=xie06].

By the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, we have Hi(X,D) = 0 for any positive integer i. Thus H0(X,D)  ≠  0 is equivalent to χ(X,D)  ≠  0. Under the same assumptions as in Conjecture [\ref=1], the Kawamata-Shokurov non-vanishing theorem says that H0(X,mD)  ≠  0 for all m  ≫  0. Thus the effective non-vanishing conjecture is an improvement of the non-vanishing theorem in some sense.

Note that EN1 is trivial by the Riemann-Roch theorem, and that EN2 was settled by Kawamata [\cite=ka00] by virtue of the logarithmic semipositivity theorem. For n  ≥  3, only a few results are known. For instance, ENn holds trivially for toric varieties [\cite=mus], EN3(X,0) holds for all canonical projective minimal threefolds X [\cite=ka00], and EN3(X,0) also holds for almost all of canonical projective threefolds X with - KX nef [\cite=xie].

In this note, we shall prove that, in the irregular case, the effective non-vanishing conjecture can be reduced to lower-dimensional cases by means of the Fourier-Mukai transform. As consequences, EN2 is reproved after Kawamata, and ENn holds for all varieties of maximal Albanese dimension.

Throughout this note, we work over the complex number field [formula]. For the definition of Kawamata log terminal (KLT, for short) and the other notions, we refer the reader to [\cite=kmm] [\cite=km].

For irregular varieties, the study of the Albanese map provides enough information to understand their birational structure. Therefore, through the Albanese map, we can utilize the Fourier-Mukai transform to give a reduction of the effective non-vanishing conjecture for irregular varieties. This idea was first used in [\cite=ch]. First of all, we need the following lemma which follows easily from [\cite=mu].

Let A be an abelian variety, F a coherent sheaf on A. Assume that [formula] for all [formula] and all i. Then F = 0.

Let Â be the dual abelian variety of A. The assumption implies that the Fourier-Mukai transform Φ(F) of F is the zero sheaf on Â. Since the Fourier-Mukai transform Φ:D(A)  →  D(Â) induces an equivalence of derived categories [\cite=mu], we have F = 0.

If ENk holds for any k < n, then ENn(X,B) holds for any X with irregularity q(X): =  dim H1(X,OX) > 0.

By Kodaira's lemma, we may assume that H = D - (KX + B) is ample and B is a [formula]-divisor. Let [formula] be a resolution of X, and [formula] the Albanese morphism of [formula]. Since (X,B) is KLT, X has only rational singularities by [\cite=km], hence [formula]. Since there are no rational curves on A, we have a non-trivial proper morphism α:X  →  A.

Let [formula], P' = α*P and F  =  α*OX(D). By the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem, we have Hi(X,D + P') = 0 for any i > 0. By the relative Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem [\cite=kmm], we have Riα*OX(D + P') = 0 for any i > 0. It follows from the Leray spectral sequence that [formula] for any i > 0. If H0(A,F) = 0, then [formula], i.e. [formula] for all [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=2], we have F = 0.

Next we prove that F  ≠  0, which implies H0(X,D) = H0(A,F)  ≠  0. Let a(X) =  dim α(X) > 0. If a(X) = n, then α:X  →  α(X) is generically finite, and it is easy to see that F  ≠  0. Assume that a(X) < n. Let f:X  →  Y be the Stein factorization of α, F a general fiber of f and G = f*OX(D). Then F is a normal proper variety of dimension less than n. Note that D|F is nef Cartier, (F,B|F) is KLT and D|F - (KF + B|F) = H|F is ample. By assumption, we have [formula], hence G  ≠  0 as well as F  ≠  0.

EN2 holds, and EN3 holds for any X with q(X) > 0.

For EN2, by the Riemann-Roch theorem, one has only to deal with the case where X is a ruled surface over a smooth projective curve C with q(X) = g(C)  ≥  2. Since EN1 holds, EN2 also holds by Theorem [\ref=3]. The second conclusion is obvious.

ENn(X,B) holds for any X of maximal Albanese dimension.

By assumption, X is of maximal Albanese dimension, i.e.  the Albanese morphism α:X  →  A satisfies that dim α(X) =  dim X = n. So we can repeat the same argument as in Theorem [\ref=3] to complete the proof by noting that α is generically finite.

Note that Corollary [\ref=5] has already appeared in [\cite=pp03] and [\cite=pp05]. Note also that the assumption that D is nef in Conjecture [\ref=1] is not needed in the proof of Corollary [\ref=5], however [\cite=pp05] proved that if D - (KX + B) is nef and big, then D must be nef on the variety X of maximal Albanese dimension. Furthermore, when the assumption that D - (KX + B) is nef and big in Conjecture [\ref=1] is replaced with the weaker assumption that D - (KX + B) is either nef or of non-negative Iitaka dimension, H0(X,D)  ≠  0 also holds for any X of maximal Albanese dimension [\cite=pp06]. Finally, we should mention that Theorem [\ref=3] and [\cite=pp05] use a similar idea in proof.
