Introduction

We shall refer to the real Banach space [formula] of bounded Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space [formula], organized in the usual way into a partially ordered real vector space, as the Hermitian algebra of [formula]. We call [formula] an "algebra" because it is, in fact, a JW-algebra in the sense of [\cite=Top], and we use the nonstandard notation [formula] because, at least at first, we shall be focusing on its structure as an partially ordered additive abelian group [\cite=Good].

Our purpose in this article is to introduce and launch a study of a generalization of [formula] which we call an abstract Hermitian algebra, or an AH-algebra for short. We derive the basic properties of an AH-algebra, including the existence polar decompositions and of spectral resolutions for each of its elements. In subsequent articles, we shall show that, by analogy with AW[formula]-algebras and JW-algebras, AH-algebras admit a classification into types I, II, and III, and that an appropriate theory of dimension and symmetries exists for such an algebra. AH-algebras may be regarded as a class of quantum structures in the sense of [\cite=DvPu].

In the sequel, [formula] denotes the ordered field of real numbers and [formula] is the set of positive integers. Also, [formula] is a Hilbert space with inner product 〈 ·   |   · 〉, [formula] is the Banach [formula]-algebra with the uniform operator norm [formula] of all bounded linear operators on [formula], and as mentioned above, [formula] is the real Banach space under [formula] of all Hermitian operators in [formula]. As usual, [formula] is organized into a partially ordered real linear space by defining A  ≤  B for [formula] iff 〈Aψ|ψ〉  ≤  〈Bψ|ψ〉 for all [formula]. The zero and identity operators on [formula] are denoted by [formula], and we denote the "unit interval" in [formula] by [formula]. Following G. Ludwig [\cite=Lud], operators [formula] are called effect operators on [formula]. The complete atomic orthomodular lattice (OML) [\cite=Kalm] of all (orthogonal) projection operators on [formula] is denoted by [formula]. We note that

[formula]

As we proceed, we shall use [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] to motivate and illustrate various concepts.

e-Rings

The following notion of an e-ring was introduced in [\cite=FRwE] and further studied in [\cite=FSRI] [\cite=FoPuPD] as a generalization of the pair [formula].

An e-ring is a pair (R,E) consisting of an associative ring R with unity 1 and a subset E  ⊆  R of elements called effects such that 0,1∈E; [formula]; and the set [formula] consisting of all finite sums [formula] with [formula] satisfies the following conditions: For all [formula],

If (R,E) is an e-ring, then the subgroup

[formula]

of the additive group of the ring R is called the directed group of (R,E), and [formula] is called the set of projections in G. The group G is organized into a partially ordered abelian group with positive cone [formula] by defining, for all g,h∈G, [formula].

It is not difficult to check that [formula] is an e-ring, the partially ordered additive abelian group [formula] is its directed group, and [formula] is its set of projections. Fundamental properties of e-rings are developed in [\cite=FRwE]. Further examples of e-rings, in addition to the prototype [formula], as well as motivation for the developments that follow can be found in [\cite=FRwE] [\cite=FSRI] [\cite=FoPuPD].

We note that G is in fact a directed group in the technical sense that it is generated by its own positive cone [formula] [\cite=Good], and the set E is the unit interval in G, i.e., E = {e∈G:0  ≤  e  ≤  1}. Also, 1 is an order unit in G [\cite=Good], i.e., if g∈G, there exists [formula] such that g  ≤  n  ·  1. Evidently,

[formula]

We understand that [formula], E, and P are partially ordered by the restrictions of the partial order ≤   on G. By [\cite=FRwE], P is an orthomodular poset (OMP) with p  ↦  1 - p as the orthocomplementation. Since the mappings g  ↦   - g, e  ↦  1 - e, and p  ↦  1 - p are order-reversing and of period 2 on G, E, and P, respectively, there is a duality principle whereby properties of existing suprema in G, E, or P are converted to properties of infima and vice versa.

In what follows, we focus attention on the directed group G, the unit interval E  ⊆  G, and the OMP P  ⊆  E of projections--the enveloping ring R is just a convenient mathematical environment in which to study the triple P  ⊆  E  ⊆  G, and the detailed structure of R will not concern us here.

Let g,h∈G. We define gCh to mean that g commutes with h, i.e., that gh = hg. If A  ⊆  G, we also define C(A), called the commutant of A in G by [formula]. The set CC(A): = C(C(A)) is called the bicommutant of A in G, and if g∈CC(h): = CC({h}), we say that g double commutes with h. We also define [formula], so that h∈CPC(g) iff h commutes with every projection that commutes with g.

In contrast to more common usage, e.g. in operator theory, we use the notation C(A) and CC(A) only in relation to elements of the directed group G rather than to arbitrary elements in the enveloping ring R. By Definition [\ref=df:e-ring] (iii), if 0  ≤  g,h∈G, then gCh  ⇒  gh = hg∈G ; however, unless 0  ≤  g,h, we do not assume a priori that gCh  ⇒  gh∈G. By the spectral theorem, if [formula], then CPC(A) = CC(A) ; in general however, even the condition CPC(g)  ⊆  C(g) may fail.

Let e,f∈E, let p∈P, and let g,h∈G. Then:

If eCf, then 0  ≤  ef  ≤  e,f  ≤  1 and [formula].

e  ≤  p  ⇔  e = ep  ⇔  e = pe and p  ≤  e  ⇔  p = pe  ⇔  p = ep.

pgp,  php∈G, and if g  ≤  h, then pgp  ≤  php.

For (i) and (ii), see [\cite=FRwE]. By [\cite=FRwE], pgp,  php∈G, and if g  ≤  h, then 0  ≤  h - g, so 0  ≤  p(h - g)p = php - pgp by [\cite=FRwE], and (iii) follows.

Parts (ii) and (iii) of the following theorem are of interest because they provide conditions not directly involving multiplication for an effect to be a projection. See [\cite=FSRI] for a proof of the theorem.

If p∈E, then the following conditions are mutually equivalent: (i) p∈P. (ii) If e,f,e + f∈E, then e,f  ≤  p  ⇒  e + f  ≤  p. (iii) If e∈E with e  ≤  p,1 - p, then e = 0. (iv) [formula].

Suppose that [formula] and that Q has a supremum (respectively, an infimum ) p in G. Then p∈P and p is the supremum (respectively, the infimum ) of Q in P.

By duality it is sufficient to consider the case in which p is the infimum of Q in G. As 0  ≤  q for all q∈Q, we have 0  ≤  p. Choose any [formula]. Then [formula], so p∈E. To prove that p∈P, suppose that e,f,e + f∈E with e,f  ≤  p. Then, for all q∈Q, we have e,f  ≤  q, whereupon e + f  ≤  q by Theorem [\ref=th:proj] (ii), and it follows that e + f  ≤  p, whence p∈P by Theorem [\ref=th:proj] (ii) again. As p∈P, it is clear that p is the infimum of Q in P.

As we progress, we shall study conditions on G, E, and P that are suggested by properties of the prototypes [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Among these are the following.

If there is an effect h∈E such that 2h = 1, then h is unique, and we write [formula] [\cite=FSRI]. For reasons elucidated [\cite=FSRI], we call [formula], if it exists, the semitransparent effect.

G has the quadratic annihilation (QA) property iff, for all g,h∈G, [formula].

G is archimedean [\cite=Good] iff, whenever g,h∈G and ng  ≤  h for all [formula], it follows that g  ≤  0.

Of course, [formula] is the semitransparent effect operator in [formula]. If [formula], then the adjoint of BA is [formula], so [formula] implies that [formula] ; i.e., [formula] has QA. Clearly, [formula] is archimedean.

Suppose that [formula], let g,h,k∈G, and let [formula]. Then: (i) gCh  ⇒  gh = hg∈G. (ii) ghg∈G. (iii) [formula]. (iv) [formula]. (v) If G is archimedean, then [formula]. (vi) If [formula], then g  ≤  h  ⇒  gk  ≤  hk.

For (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), see [\cite=FSRI] ; for (v), see [\cite=FSRI].

(vi) Assume the hypotheses. Then 0  ≤  h - g,k and (h - g)Ck, so 0  ≤  (h - g)k = hk - gk by Definition [\ref=df:e-ring] (iii), and by part (i), hk,  gk∈G.

Suppose that G has QA and let g,h∈G. Then gh = 0  ⇒  hg = 0.

By QA, [formula].

AH-Algebras

We maintain Standing Assumptions [\ref=as:e-Ring].

G has the Vigier (V) property [\cite=FSRI] iff every ascending sequence [formula] in G that is bounded above in G has a supremum g in G, and [formula].

G has the complete Vigier (complete V) property iff every ascending net [formula] in G that is bounded above in G has a supremum g in G, and [formula]).

G has the commutative Vigier (CV) property iff every ascending sequence [formula] of pairwise commuting elements of G that is bounded above in G has a supremum g in G, and [formula].

A net [formula] in G is called a C-net iff for all α,β∈A, [formula]. We say that G has the complete commutative Vigier (complete CV) property iff every ascending C-net [formula] in G that is bounded above in G has a supremum g in G, and [formula].

An argument originally due to J. Vigier [\cite=Vigier] shows that [formula] has the V property [\cite=RNg]; in fact, by essentially the same argument, [formula] has the complete V property. Obviously, [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that [formula] and G has the CV property. Then:

If 0  ≤  a∈G, then 0 is the infimum in G of the sequence [formula].

G is archimedean.

(i) As 0  ≤  a, the sequence [formula] is descending, bounded below by 0, and its elements commute pairwise, so by CV and duality, it has an infimum c in G and 0  ≤  c. Also, [formula] for all [formula], whence [formula] for all [formula], so 2c  ≤  c, i.e., c  ≤  0, and it follows that c = 0.

(ii) Suppose g,h∈G and ng  ≤  h for all [formula]. As G is directed, there exist a,b∈G with 0  ≤  a,b and h = a - b  ≤  a, whence ng  ≤  a for all [formula]. In particular, [formula] for all [formula], and it follows that [formula] for all [formula]. Consequently, by part (i), g  ≤  0.

Evidently, our prototype [formula] is an AH-algebra as per the following definition.

The directed group G of the e-ring (R,E) is an abstract Hermitian (AH) algebra iff [formula], G has the quadratic annihilation (QA) property, and G has the commutative Vigier (CV) property.

Let e∈E, let d: = 1 - e, let [formula], and define the sequence [formula] recursively by [formula] for all [formula]. Then [formula] is an ascending sequence of pairwise commuting effects in [formula], so by CV it has a supremum s in G and [formula]. Then [formula] with 1 - s∈CC(e).

The proof is identical to the proof of [\cite=FSRI], which obviously requires only the CV property, not the full V property.

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lm:1/2Lemma] (v), Theorem [\ref=th:1/2+CV] (ii), and Theorem [\ref=th:SRE] together with [\cite=FSRI] we have the following.

If 0  ≤  g∈G, there exists a unique element in G, called the square root of g and denoted by [formula], such that [formula] and [formula]; moreover, [formula].

By Definition [\ref=df:e-ring] (vi), if [formula] for some h∈G, then 0  ≤  g. Conversely, by Theorem [\ref=th:SqRoot], if 0  ≤  g, then there exists h∈G, namely [formula], such that [formula]. Thus, the positive cone in G consists precisely of squares of elements of G.

As usual, we say that an element g∈G is invertible iff there is an element h∈G such that gh = hg = 1. If such an h exists, it is unique, it is called the inverse of g, and it is written as [formula].

Let g∈G with 0  ≤  g. Then g is invertible iff there exists [formula] such that 1  ≤  Mg. Moreover, if g is invertible, then [formula].

The proof of [\cite=FSRI] goes through as it obviously requires only the CV property rather than the stronger V property.

Equipped with the Jordan product [formula], our prototype [formula] is a Jordan algebra. More generally, we have the following result.

G can be organized into an archimedean partially ordered real vector space and, as such, it is a Jordan algebra with respect to the Jordan product [formula].

The full V property is not needed for the proof of [\cite=FSRI]--only CV is required. Thus, G can be organized into a partially ordered real vector space that is also a Jordan algebra with the indicated Jordan product, and G is archimedean by Theorem [\ref=th:1/2+CV] (ii).

In the sequel, we understand that G is organized into a partially ordered real vector space as per Theorem [\ref=th:Jordan]. Moreover, we make routine use of Theorems [\ref=th:SqRoot], [\ref=th:PosInverse]; Lemmas [\ref=lm:EProperties], [\ref=lm:1/2Lemma], [\ref=lm:QALemma]; and the following lemma.

If [formula] for i = 1,2,...,n, there exists [formula] such that [formula] for i = 1,2,...,n.

As 1 is an order unit in G, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. Let λ: = 1 / N.

Let g∈G be the supremum (respectively, the infimum ) in G of the ascending (respectively, descending ) sequence [formula] of pairwise commuting elements. Suppose 0  ≤  h∈G and [formula] for all [formula]. Then gh = hg is the supremum (respectively, the infimum ) in G of [formula].

We prove the lemma for an ascending sequence--the result for a descending sequence then follows by duality. By CV, we have gCh, so gh = hg∈G. As [formula] and 0  ≤  h, there exists [formula] such that [formula]. For all [formula], [formula], so [formula], whence [formula]. Also, [formula], whence by Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (i), [formula], i.e.,

[formula]

As [formula] and [formula], Lemma [\ref=lm:1/2Lemma] (vi) implies that [formula] for all [formula]. Suppose k∈G and [formula] for all [formula]. We have to show that gh  ≤  k. We have

[formula]

whence

[formula]

and it follows that g  ≤  g - λ(gh - k). Therefore, λ(gh - k)  ≤  0, so gh - k  ≤  0, i.e., gh  ≤  k.

Let g,h∈G with gCh and 0  ≤  g  ≤  h. Then: (i)  [formula] and (ii)  [formula].

(i) Follows from [\cite=FRwE].

(ii) Choose [formula] such that e: = λg∈E and f: = λh∈E. Then eCf, and e  ≤  f. As [formula] and [formula], it will be sufficient to prove that [formula]. Define

[formula]

and by recursion, for all [formula],

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=th:SRE], [formula] and [formula] have suprema s and t, respectively, in G; moreover, [formula] and [formula]. As e  ≤  f, we have c  ≤  d, [formula], and by part (i) and induction on n, [formula] for all [formula]. Therefore, t  ≤  s, so [formula].

Carrier Projections

We maintain Standing Assumption [\ref=as:AH-alg]

Let e∈E. Then [formula] is a descending sequence of pairwise commuting effects in E, whence by CV it has an infimum q in G and q∈CC(e). Moreover, [formula], and for all h∈G, eh = 0  ⇔  (1 - q)h = 0.

As 1 - e∈E, Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (i) implies that [formula] is a descending sequence in E, and it is obvious that the terms of this sequence commute pairwise; therefore, by CV, it has an infimum q in G and [formula]. Thus, 1 - q∈CC(e). Evidently, 0  ≤  q  ≤  1 - e  ≤  1, whence [formula] by Theorem [\ref=th:MonotonicitySR] (ii), i.e., [formula], and it follows from Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (i) that [formula]. For every [formula], we have [formula], so by Theorem [\ref=th:MonotonicitySR] (ii) again, [formula], and it follows that [formula]. Therefore, [formula], so [formula], whence [formula].

Suppose h∈G and eh = 0. Then [formula] and hCe, therefore [formula] for all [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lm:MonotoneSupInf], [formula] is the infimum in G of the sequence [formula]. But [formula], and by induction on n, [formula] for all [formula], so all terms in the sequence [formula] are equal to [formula], and it follows that [formula]. Therefore, [formula], so (1 - q)h = 0 by QA. Thus, eh = 0  ⇒  (1 - q)h = 0.

Conversely, suppose that (1 - q)h = 0. As q is the infimum in G of [formula], we have q  ≤  1 - e, so e  ≤  1 - q∈P, and it follows that e = e(1 - q). Therefore eh = e(1 - q)h = 0, and we have eh = 0  ⇔  (1 - q)h = 0.

For each g∈G there is a uniquely determined projection [formula] such that, for all h∈G, [formula]. Moreover, [formula].

Let g∈G. As [formula], there exists [formula] such that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lm:(1-e)^n], there is a projection [formula] such that, for all h∈G, [formula]. By QA, for all h∈G, we have [formula], so

[formula]

To prove uniqueness, suppose p∈P and gh = 0  ⇔  ph = 0 for all h∈G. Then [formula] for all h∈G. Putting h = 1 - p, we find that [formula], i.e., [formula], so [formula]. By symmetry, [formula], so [formula].

If g∈G, the uniquely determined projection [formula] in Theorem [\ref=th:CarrierProperty] is called the carrier projection of g.

As [formula] is an AH-algebra, it follows that each Hermitian operator [formula] has a carrier projection [formula]. In fact, as is easily seen, [formula] is just the projection onto the orthogonal complement of the null space of A.

In view of Lemma [\ref=lm:QALemma], the carrier projection [formula] of g∈G is characterized not only by the "right annihilation" condition [formula], but also by the corresponding "left annihilation" condition [formula]. Therefore, G has the so-called carrier property [\cite=FoPuPD], and the results of [\cite=FoPuPD] are at our disposal.

Let g,h∈G, p∈P, and e∈E. Then: (i) [formula]. (ii) [formula]. (iii) [formula]. (iv) [formula] is the smallest projection p∈P such that e  ≤  p. (v) [formula]. (vi) [formula].

(i)-(v) follow from [\cite=FoPuPD]. To prove (vi), we observe that [formula] and by the "left annihilation" condition [formula]. Moreover, as both [formula] and [formula] are projections, [formula].

P is a σ-complete orthomodular lattice (OML ). Moreover, if G has the complete CV property, then P is a complete OML.

That P is an OML follows from [\cite=FoPuPD]. Let [formula] be an ascending sequence in P. To prove that P is σ-complete, it will be sufficient to show that [formula] has a supremum in P. By Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (ii), the projections in the sequence [formula] commute pairwise, whence by CV, [formula] has a supremum p in G. By Corollary [\ref=co:Psup/infClosed], p∈P and p is the supremum of [formula] in P.

Suppose G has the complete CV-property, let Q  ⊆  P, let F be the directed set under inclusion of all finite subsets F of Q, and for F∈F, let [formula] be the supremum in P of F. Then [formula] is an ascending C-net in G bounded above by 1, and (arguing as above), one shows that its supremum in G belongs to P and is the supremum of Q in P.

If A  ⊆  G, then p∈P is a carrier projection for A iff, for all h∈G, the condition ah = 0 for all a∈A is equivalent to the condition ph = 0. Clearly, if A has a carrier projection p, then it is unique, and we shall denote it by [formula].

We omit the straightforward proof of the following.

Let A  ⊆  G. Then [formula] exists iff [formula] has a supremum p in P, in which case [formula]. Therefore, P is a complete OML iff every subset A  ⊆  G has a carrier projection [formula].

If p,q∈P, we denote the supremum and infimum of p and q in P by [formula] and [formula], respectively.

Let p,q∈P. Then: (i) p  ≤  q  ⇔  q - p∈P. (ii) If p  ≤  q, then [formula]. (iii) If p + q∈P, then pq = qp = 0 and [formula]. (iv) If pCq, then [formula], [formula], and [formula].

For (i) and (ii), see [\cite=FRwE]. For (iii), see [\cite=FRwE]. For (iv), see [\cite=FRwE].

Let g∈G. As [formula], we can and do define [formula]. Also, we define [formula] and [formula].

Let g∈G and let [formula]. Then:

(i)-(viii) are obvious. By Theorem [\ref=th:CarrierProperty] and (ii), we have [formula], proving (ix), and (x) follows from (ix) and (ii). We have [formula], and since [formula], we also have [formula]; hence (xi) and (xii) follow from [formula]. Likewise, [formula] and [formula] follow from [formula]. Since 0  ≤  |g|,  p,  1 - p, Definition [\ref=df:e-ring] (iii) implies that [formula] and [formula], proving (xiii) and (xiv).

If g∈G, then [formula] and [formula] are characterized by the properties [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Suppose a,b∈G, g = a - b, ab = 0, and 0  ≤  a + b. Then ab = ba = 0, whence [formula], and as 0  ≤  a + b, it follows that [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and [formula].

The Comparability and Polar Decomposition Properties

We maintain Standing Assumption [\ref=as:AH-alg].

Define [formula]. We say that G has the comparability property [\cite=FoPuPD] iff [formula] for all g∈G.

If g∈G, then [formula], hence G has the comparability property.

As CC(g)  ⊆  CPC(g), parts (ix) and (xi)-(xiv) of Lemma [\ref=lm:Prop_g+g-] imply that [formula].

In general, there may be more than one projection in [formula], but it can be shown that [formula] is the smallest such projection [\cite=FSR]. Moreover, no matter which projection [formula] is chosen, one always has [formula] and [formula] [\cite=FGCOMP].

By [\cite=FCPOAG], G is a so-called compressible group [\cite=FCG], and since it has the comparability property, it is a so-called comgroup [\cite=FSR]. Translating [\cite=FGCOMP] to our present context, we observe that G has the Rickart projection property iff, for each g∈G, there exists g  '∈G such that, for all p∈P, p  ≤  g  '  ⇔  pg = gp = 0. By Lemma [\ref=lm:CarrierLemma] (iii), G has the Rickart projection property with [formula] and [formula] for all g∈G. Therefore, G is a so-called Rickart comgroup [\cite=FSR], whence by changing notation from g  ' to [formula] and from g  '  ' to [formula], we can invoke all the results of [\cite=FSR] and [\cite=FGCOMP].

Let g,h∈G. Then: (i) If h∈CPC(g) and g  ≤  h, then [formula]. (ii) If 0  ≤  g  ≤  h, then [formula]. (iii) If h∈CPC(g) and g  ≤  h, then [formula]. (iv) If [formula], then 0  ≤  g. (v) [formula].

For (i), see [\cite=FGCOMP] and for (ii), see [\cite=FGCOMP]. Clearly, (iii) follows from (i) and (ii). For (iv), see [\cite=FGCOMP], and for (v), see [\cite=FGCOMP].

An element s∈G is called a signum of g iff: (i) [formula], (ii) 0  ≤  sg = gs∈G, (iii) [formula], and (iv) [formula], [formula]. We say that G has the polar decomposition (PD) property [\cite=FoPuPD] iff every g∈G has a signum s∈G.

Let g∈G. Then [formula] is the unique signum of g; hence G has the polar decomposition (PD ) property. Moreover: (i) s∈CC(g). (ii) [formula]. (iii) |g| = sg = gs. (iv) g has the "polar decomposition" g = s|g| = |g|s. (v) [formula].

As G has both the carrier and comparability properties, [\cite=FoPuPD] implies that the signum s of g exists, s is uniquely determined by g, and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lm:Prop_g+g-] (ix), [formula]. Likewise, by Lemma [\ref=lm:Prop_g+g-] [formula], and (i) follows. See [\cite=FoPuPD] for proofs of (ii), (iii), and (iv). To prove (v), we note that gh = 0  ⇒  sgh = 0  ⇒  |g|h = 0  ⇒  s|g|h = 0  ⇒  gh = 0, so gh = 0  ⇔  |g|h = 0.

Let g∈G. Then the following conditions are mutually equivalent: (i) g is invertible. (ii) |g| is invertible. (iii) There exists [formula] such that λ  ·  1  ≤  |g|. Moreover, if [formula] exists, then [formula] and the signum s of g satisfies [formula].

Let s be the signum of g. As s∈CC(g) and |g|∈CC(g), the desired equivalences follow from Theorem [\ref=th:PosInverse] and the obvious facts that if [formula] exists, then [formula], and if [formula] exists, then [formula]. Also, if [formula] exists, it is clear that if h∈G, then gh = 0  ⇔  h = 0, so [formula], and therefore [formula] by Theorem [\ref=th:PD] (ii).

States and the 1-Norm

We maintain Standing Assumption [\ref=as:AH-alg].

If we regard G and [formula] as a ordered additive abelian groups, then an order-preserving group homomorphism [formula] such that ω(1) = 1 is called a state for G [\cite=Good]. We denote the set of all states for G by Ω(G), or simply as Ω if G is understood.

Note that Ω is a convex subset of the locally convex real linear topological space [formula] of real-valued functions on G with the topology of pointwise convergence. Equipped with the relative topology inherited from [formula], Ω is a nonempty compact set [\cite=Good] called the state space of G. By [\cite=Good], every state ω∈Ω is a linear functional on the real linear space G.

Ω is "order determining" in the sense that, for g,h∈G, g  ≤  h  ⇔  ω(g)  ≤  ω(h) for all ω∈Ω.

As G is archimedean, [\cite=Good] implies that 0  ≤  h - g  ⇔  0  ≤  ω(h - g) = ω(h) - ω(g) for all ω∈Ω.

Define the 1-norm [formula] by

[formula]

for all g∈G.

The 1-norm [formula] is a norm on the real linear space G. Moreover, for all g,h∈G: (i) [formula]. (ii) [formula]. (iii) [formula]. (iv) [formula]. (v) If [formula], [formula], and [formula] for all i = 1,2,...,n, then [formula].

That [formula] is a norm on G as well as properties (i) and (ii) can be deduced from the results in [\cite=Good]. For (iii) and (iv), see [\cite=FSR]. Let [formula]. By the hypotheses of (v), [formula], whence (v) follows from (ii).

As is well-known, for the archimedean directed group [formula], the 1-norm coincides with the uniform operator norm.

Let g,h∈G. Then: (i) [formula]. (ii) [formula]. (iii) [formula]. (iv) [formula].

If - 1  ≤  g  ≤  1, then 0  ≤  1 - g,1 + g with (1 - g)C(1 + g), whence [formula], i.e., [formula]. Conversely, [formula] follows from [\cite=FSRI], proving (i). If [formula], then by replacing g by [formula] in (i), we deduce that [formula], from which (ii) follows. If h = |g|, then [formula], so [formula] by (ii), and (iii) follows. To prove (iv), suppose that gCh. Then |g|C|h|, so by (iii) we can assume without loss of generality that 0  ≤  g,h. Moreover, we can assume that [formula], so that [formula], and define [formula] and [formula]. Then e,f∈E with ef = fe, hence 0  ≤  ef  ≤  1 by Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (i), and it follows that [formula]. Therefore, [formula].

Recall that G is said to be monotone σ-complete iff every ascending sequence in G that is bounded above in G has a supremum in G [\cite=Good]. Thus, if G has property V, it is monotone σ-complete.

If G is monotone σ-complete, then it is a real Banach space under the 1-norm.

See [\cite=Hand].

Let [formula] be a sequence in G and let g∈G. Then:

If [formula] in the 1-norm, then for each ω∈Ω we have [formula] in [formula].

If [formula] and [formula] in [formula] for each ω∈Ω, then g is the supremum in G of [formula].

If [formula] is an ascending sequence of pairwise commuting elements in G, g∈G, and [formula] in the 1-norm, then g is the supremum in G of [formula] and [formula].

(i) Suppose that [formula] in the 1-norm and let ω∈Ω. Let [formula] with ε > 0 and choose [formula] such that, for all [formula], [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=th:Norm] (i), If n  ≥  N, then [formula], whence [formula].

(ii) Assume the hypotheses of (ii) and let ω∈Ω. Then [formula], and it follows that ω(g) is the supremum in [formula] of the sequence [formula]. In particular, for each [formula], [formula], and since ω∈Ω is arbitrary, it follows from Theorem [\ref=th:OrderDetermining] that [formula]. To prove that g is the supremum in G of [formula], suppose h∈G and [formula] for all [formula]. Then, for each ω∈Ω, we have [formula] for all [formula], whence, ω(g)  ≤  ω(h), and since ω∈Ω is arbitrary, it follows that g  ≤  h.

(iii) Follows from (i), (ii), and CV.

Spectral Resolution

We maintain Standing Assumption [\ref=as:AH-alg] and we denote the state space of G by Ω.

If g∈G, then the spectral lower and upper bounds for g are defined by [formula] and [formula], respectively.

If g∈G, then: (i) [formula]. (ii) {ω(g):ω∈Ω} is the closed interval [formula]. (iii) [formula]. (iv) [formula] and [formula].

Parts (i) and (ii) follow as in the proof of [\cite=Good], (iii) follows as in the proof of [\cite=Good], and (iv) is obvious.

In [\cite=FSR], we proved that each element g in a Rickart comgroup has a rational spectral resolution [formula]. Under our current stronger hypotheses, we can extend the rational spectral resolution as follows to obtain a real spectral resolution [formula] for each element g∈G.

Let g∈G and [formula]. We define

[formula]

The family of projections [formula] is called the spectral resolution for g, and for [formula], [formula] is called the λ-eigenprojection for g. If [formula], then λ is an eigenvalue of g. If g is understood, we write the spectral resolution for g as [formula] and we write the family of eigenprojections for g as [formula].

Let [formula] be the spectral resolution of - g and let [formula] be the family of eigenprojections for - g. Then, for all [formula], (i) [formula] and (ii) [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lm:Prop_g+g-] (vii), we have

[formula]

Thus, by Lemma [\ref=lm:LemmaA] (v),

[formula]

[formula]

whence, by Lemma [\ref=lm:p-q] [\ref=p+q] (iii), [formula], proving (i). Finally, it is clear that [formula] for all h∈G, so

[formula]

For all [formula]:

[formula] and [formula].

[formula].

[formula] and [formula].

[formula].

[formula], and [formula].

[formula], and [formula].

[formula], and [formula].

If λ  ≤  μ and q∈P with [formula], then λq  ≤  qgq  ≤  μq.

(i) Clearly, C(g - λ  ·  1) = C(g) and CC(g - λ  ·  1) = CC(g), whence [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lm:Prop_g+g-] (ix) and Theorem [\ref=th:CarrierProperty].

(ii) By Theorem [\ref=th:Comparability], [formula], and (ii) then follows from the definition of [formula]

(iii) Assume that λ  ≤  μ. Then [formula], and [formula]; hence [formula] follows from Lemma [\ref=lm:LemmaA] (iii). Thus, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lm:p-q] [\ref=p+q] (ii).

(iv) By Lemma [\ref=lm:LemmaA] (v), we have [formula], whence [formula]. Assume that λ  <  μ. By (i), [formula] and [formula], so [formula]. By (ii), [formula], and as the projection [formula] commutes with both g and [formula], Lemma [\ref=lm:1/2Lemma] (vi) implies that

[formula]

As [formula], we have [formula], i.e., [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

whence [formula], i.e., [formula]. But, μ  -  λ  >  0, so [formula], and it follows that [formula].

(v) If λ > U, there exists [formula] such that μ  <  λ and g  ≤  μ  ·  1  ≤  λ  ·  1, whereupon g - λ  ·  1  ≤  0, i.e., [formula], so [formula], and it follows that [formula]. Conversely, if [formula], then [formula], so [formula], whence g - λ  ·  1  ≤  0, and it follows that U  ≤  λ; consequently, [formula].

(vi) Suppose λ  <  L. Then there exists [formula] such that λ  <  μ and μ  ·  1  ≤  g. Therefore, [formula], and it follows from Lemma [\ref=lm:LemmaA] (ii) that [formula], whence [formula]. Conversely, if [formula], then [formula], whence 0  ≤  (g - λ  ·  1), i.e., λ  ·  1  ≤  g, by Lemma [\ref=lm:LemmaA] (iv), whereupon λ  ≤  L; consequently, [formula].

(vii) Follows directly from (v) and (vi).

(viii) Assume the hypotheses. By (iii), [formula] and [formula]; hence [formula] and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lm:p-q] [\ref=p+q] (i). Also, by (ii),

[formula]

hence, by Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (iii),

[formula]

[formula]

Consequently, λq  ≤  qgq  ≤  μq.

Suppose that [formula] with

[formula]

and let [formula] with [formula] for i = 1,2,...,n. Define [formula] for i = 1,2,...,n, and let [formula]. Then:

[formula]

In the proof, we understand that i = 1,2,...,n and that all sums are from i = 1 to i = n. By parts (i) and (iii) of Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps], we have [formula] with [formula], whence [formula]. That [formula] follows from parts (v) and (vi) of Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps]. Since [formula], Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (viii) implies that [formula] and, adding these inequalities, we find that [formula]. The latter inequalities together with [formula] and [formula] imply that

[formula]

[formula]

whence

[formula]

parts (ii) and (v) of Theorem [\ref=th:Norm] and part (iv) of Theorem [\ref=th:Norm] with p = 1.

If h∈G, then [formula] for all [formula].

If hCg and [formula], then [formula] by Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (i). Conversely, suppose that [formula] for all [formula]. Choose and fix [formula] with α < L and β > U. As usual, a partition of the closed interval [formula] is understood to be a finite sequence [formula] such that [formula]. The closed interval

[formula]

as follows: [formula] is the partition [formula] having only one subinterval, namely

[formula]

Let g,h∈G and let A  ⊆  G. Then: (i) gCh iff every projection in the spectral resolution of g commutes with every projection in the spectral resolution of h. (ii) [formula]. (iii) CPC(g) = CC(g).

(i) Follows from Theorem [\ref=th:SPComutativity]. As [formula], we have [formula]. Conversely, suppose [formula], h∈C(A), and [formula] is the spectral resolution of h. Then by Theorem [\ref=th:SPComutativity], [formula], so [formula] for every [formula], and therefore gCh. Consequently, [formula], and (ii) holds. Putting A: = {g} in (ii), we obtain (iii).

The following theorem indicates the sense in which the spectral resolution of g is "continuous from the right."

If [formula], then [formula] is the infimum in the OML P of [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (iii), [formula] is a lower bound for A. Suppose that r∈P is another lower bound for A. We have to prove that [formula]. Evidently, [formula] is a lower bound for A. Define [formula] (Lemma [\ref=lm:p-q] [\ref=p+q] (ii)). It will be sufficient to prove that q = 0. Let [formula]. If λ  ≤  α, then [formula], so [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lm:EProperties] (ii). If α  <  λ, then [formula], so [formula], and again [formula]; hence gCq by Theorem [\ref=th:SPComutativity].

Now suppose that [formula]. Then [formula], so [formula] and [formula], so [formula], and it follows from Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (viii) that αq  ≤  qgq = gq = qg  ≤  μq. Let ω∈Ω. As ω is a linear functional on G, we have

[formula]

and since μ  >  α is arbitrary, it follows that ω(αq)  =  ω(qg). By Theorem [\ref=th:OrderDetermining], we conclude that αq = qg = gq. Therefore, q(g - α  ·  1) = 0, whence [formula] by Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (iv). But [formula], so q = 0.

In view of Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (v), Theorem [\ref=th:RightContinuity] has the following corollary.

[formula]

In the same sense as Theorem [\ref=th:RightContinuity], the eigenprojection [formula] may be interpreted as the "jump" that occurs as λ approaches α from the left.

If [formula], then [formula] is the supremum in the OML P of [formula].

By Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps] (iv), [formula], so [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lm:p-q] [\ref=p+q] (ii). Let [formula] be the spectral resolution of - g. By Theorem [\ref=th:RightContinuity] and Lemma [\ref=lm:SRminusg], [formula] is the infimum in P of

[formula]

hence by duality in P (in this case, the De Morgan law), [formula] is the supremum in P of

[formula]

We have to show that [formula] is also the supremum in P of B. If μ  <  α, then by parts (iii) and (iv) of Theorem [\ref=th:SpecProps], [formula], i.e., [formula] is an upper bound for B. Suppose that r∈P is another upper bound for B. Then, if μ  <  α, we have [formula], i.e., r is an upper bound for C; hence [formula], so [formula] is the supremum of B.

Blocks and C-blocks

According to Theorem [\ref=th:SigmaOML], P is a σ-complete orthomodular lattice. Recall that elements p,q∈P are called (Mackey) compatible iff there are pairwise orthogonal elements p1,q1,r∈P such that [formula], [formula].

Two elements p,q∈P are compatible iff they commute.

Let pq = qp and put r = pq. By Lemma 4.8 (iv), [formula]. Then p = (p - r) + r,q = (q - r) + r, and r,p - r,q - r are pairwise orthogonal.

Conversely, let p = p1 + r,q = q1 + r with p1,q1,r pairwise orthogonal. Then pq = qp = r.

A subset B of P is called a block of P if B is a maximal set of pairwise compatible elements [\cite=Kalm]. In view of Lemma [\ref=lm:compcom], it is clear that B  ⊆  P is a block of P iff [formula]. It is well known that every block in P is a maximal Boolean σ-subalgebra of P. Following [\cite=FoPu1], a subgroup of G having the form C(B), where B is a block in P, will be called a C-block in G.

A subset H of G is a C-block of G iff H is a maximal set of pairwise commuting elements of G.

If H  ⊆  G, it is clear that H is a maximal set of pairwise commuting elements of G iff H = C(H). Suppose H = C(B) for some block [formula] of P. Then by Corollary [\ref=co:SPCommutativity] (ii), [formula]. Conversely, suppose H = C(H) and put [formula]. Then CC(H) = C(H) = H and, again by Corollary [\ref=co:SPCommutativity] (ii), [formula].

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=th:maxcom], G is covered by its own C-blocks. Moreover, as we proceed to show, each C-block H in G is itself an AH-algebra that has the structure of an archimedean lattice-ordered commutative real Banach algebra.

Let H be a C-block in G. Then [formula] is an e-ring with directed group H, the e-ring partial order on H is the partial order induced from G, the set of projections in H is a block B in P, H = C(B), and H is an AH-algebra with the Vigier property. Moreover, under the 1-norm [formula], H is a commutative and associative real Banach algebra with unity element 1 and with the property that [formula].

By definition of a C-block, there exists a block B in P such that H = C(B). We omit the straightforward verification that [formula] satisfies the conditions in Definition [\ref=df:e-ring], that H is the directed group of [formula], that B is the set of projections in H, and that the e-ring partial order on H is the restriction to H of the partial order on G. Obviously, [formula] and H inherits the QA property from G.

To prove that H = C(B) has the V property, suppose [formula] is an ascending sequence in H that is bounded above in H. Then the sequence is bounded above in G, and by Theorem [\ref=th:maxcom], the elements of the sequence commute pairwise, hence by CV it has a supremum h in G and [formula]. If p∈B, then [formula] for all [formula], and therefore hCp. Consequently, h∈C(B) = H, so h is the supremum of the sequence [formula] in H, and h double commutes in H with the set [formula]. Thus, H has the V property, hence it has the CV property, and therefore H is an AH-algebra.

Obviously, H = C(B) is closed under multiplication by real numbers, and if g,h∈H, then gh = hg∈G by Theorem [\ref=th:maxcom] and Lemma [\ref=lm:1/2Lemma] (i), whence gh∈H. Therefore, H is a commutative and associative real linear algebra with unity element 1. By Theorem [\ref=th:NormofProduct] (iv), H is a normed linear algebra under the 1-norm. As H has the V property, it is monotone σ-complete, whence it is a Banach algebra under the 1-norm by Theorem [\ref=th:Banach]. By Theorem [\ref=th:NormofProduct] (ii), [formula] for all h∈H.

Let A be a linear algebra over [formula]. We say that A is a partially ordered linear algebra iff the additive group of A is a partially ordered abelian group, and whenever 0  ≤  a,b∈A and [formula], we have 0  ≤  ab and 0  ≤  λa. If a partially ordered linear algebra A is a lattice, it is called an [formula]-algebra [\cite=Fuc].

Let H be a C-block in P. Then: (i) [formula]. (ii) H is an archimedean Dedekind σ-complete [formula]-algebra with order unit 1. (iii) If g,h∈H, then the infimum and supremum of g and h in H are given by [formula] and [formula]. (iv) If h∈H, then the spectral resolution and the family of eigenprojections of h are the same whether calculated in G or in H.

There is a block B in P such that H = C(B).

(i) If h∈H = C(B), then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lm:Prop_g+g-] (ii), and [formula] by Theorem [\ref=th:CarrierProperty].

(ii) Obviously, H = C(B) is an archimedean partially ordered algebra over [formula] and 1 is an order unit in H. To prove that H is a lattice, let g,h∈H and put [formula]. Then by (i), [formula], and by Theorem [\ref=th:Comparability], p∈P±(g - h), so (1 - p)(g - h)  ≤  0  ≤  p(g - h) with (1 - p)(g - h),p(g - h)∈H. Put a: = ph + (1 - p)g. Then a∈H and a  ≤  g,h. Suppose b∈H and b  ≤  g,h. Then pb  ≤  ph and (1 - p)b  ≤  (1 - p)g, so b  ≤  pb + (1 - p)b  ≤  a. Thus a is the infimum of g and h in H. The existence of the supremum of g and h in H is shown dually, hence H is a lattice. By Theorem [\ref=th:CBlockAHAlg], H has the V property, therefore it is monotone σ-complete, and consequently it is Dedekind σ-complete by [\cite=Good].

(iii) Let g,h∈H. Recall that in a comparability group, the pseudo-meet [formula] and pseudo-join [formula] are defined by [formula], [formula] [\cite=FGCOMP]. By (i), [formula], and by [\cite=FGCOMP] [formula] and [formula].

(iv) Follows directly from (i) and Definition [\ref=df:SpecRes].

In view of Theorem [\ref=th:CBlockLattice] (iii), we have the following.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula] are C-blocks in G and that [formula]. Then the infimum and supremum of g and h as calculated in [formula] are the same as the infimum and supremum of g and h as calculated in [formula].
