Introduction

We consider undirected graphs with no loops and no parallel edges unless stated explicitly. All notions and facts on graphs, that are used but not described here, can be found in [\cite=BM] [\cite=D] [\cite=Wst].

Given a graph G and a family F of non-isomorphic graphs, an F- packing of G is a subgraph of G whose every component is isomorphic to a member of F. An F-packing P of G is called an F- factor if V(P)  =  V(G). The F- packing problem is the problem of finding in G an F-packing having the maximum number of vertices.

If F consists of one graph F, then an F-packing and an F-factor are called simply an F- packing and an F- factor, respectively. Accordingly, the F- packing problem is the problem of finding in G an F-packing having the maximum number of vertices or, equivalently, the maximum number of components.

If F is a 2-vertex connected graph, then the F packing problem is the classical matching problem and a very beautiful and deep theory has been developed about this problem and its generalizations (see, for example, [\cite=LP] as well as [\cite=Kaneko], [\cite=Kstars], and [\cite=LoPo]). In particular, it is known that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum matching. It turns out that if F is a connected graph with at least three vertices, then the F-packing problem is already NP-hard [\cite=HK]. Moreover, if Pk is the k-vertex path, then for every k  ≥  3 the Pk-packing problem turns out to be also NP-hard for cubic graphs [\cite=K1].

Let Λ denote a 3-vertex path. We will consider mainly the Λ-packing problem. This problem is interesting for various reasons. Here are some of them. (R1) Path Λ is the smallest graph F, for which the F-packing problem is NP-hard (even in the class of cubic graphs). Although the Λ-packing problem is NP-hard, i.e. possibly intractable in general, it would be interesting to find some natural and non-trivial classes of graphs, for which the problem is tractable, i.e. solvable in polynomial time (e.g. [\ref=r-regukargraphs], [\ref=r-regukargraphsTreePack], [\ref=2conclfr], and [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks] below). It is also interesting to find polynomial-time algorithms that provide a good approximation solution for the problem (e.g. [\ref=km] - [\ref=r-regukargraphsTreePack] and [\ref=eb(G)clfr] below). (R2) Probably, one of the first non-trivial results in matching theory is Petersen's theorem (1891) stating that every cubic connected graph with at most two bridges has a perfect matching (see [\cite=LP]). There are indications that a result of similar nature may also be true for the Λ-packing problem in the class of 3-connected graphs (see Problem [\ref=Pr3con] and theorems [\ref=cubic3-conZTF] - [\ref=cubic3-conF] below). (R3) It is known [\cite=Kaneko] that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for the {P3,P4,P5}-packing problem. It can also be shown that a cubic 3-connected graph has a {P3,P4,P5}-factor. This fact for {P3,P4,P5}-factors is analogous to Petersen's theorem for matchings mentioned above. However, the complexity status of an {A,B}-packing problem for A,B∈{P3,P4,P5} and A  ≠  B is not known. Some results in [\cite=K3con-cub] (see also [\ref=cubic3-conZTF] - [\ref=cubic3-conF] below)) show that the Λ-packing problem for cubic 3-connected graphs is related to an {A,B}-packing problem with A  =  P3  =  Λ and B∈{P4,P5}. (R4) The Λ-packing problem is also related to the minimum domination problem in a graph (which is known to be NP-hard). Namely, the size of a maximum Λ-packing in a graph G can be used to give an upper bound for its domination number (see Section [\ref=domination]). (R5) The Λ-packing problem is also related to the various problems on whether a graph G has a spanning subgraph H of special type. In the graph hamiltonicity theory H is usually a Hamiltonian cycle or a Hamiltonian path. Obviously, the existence of such a subgraph H in a graph G implies the existence of a Λ-packing with ⌊v(G) / 3⌋ components. For that reason, various Hamiltonicity conjectures give rise to the corresponding Λ-factor problems or conjectures. (This was the original motivation to consider Problem [\ref=Pr3con] below.) For example, in 1984 M. M. Mathews and D. P. Summer [\cite=MS] conjectured that every 4-connected claw-free graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. Some results in the paper support this conjecture. (R6) Let L(G) denote the line graph of G. Then a vertex disjoint packing in L(G) corresponds to an edge disjoint packing in G and a vertex disjoint packing in G corresponds to an induced vertex disjoint packing in L(G). Since L(G) is a claw-free graph, the study of the Λ-packing problem for claw-free graphs may allow to solve some problems on vertex and/or edge disjoint packings in graphs (see Section [\ref=related-results]). (R7) The problem of packing induced 3-vertex paths in a claw-free graph is also related to the Hadwiger conjecture (see Section [\ref=related-results]). In Section [\ref=notions] we give main notions and notation we use. In Section [\ref=preliminaries] we describe some known results and open questions and outline main results of the paper. The formulations and proofs of the main results on packings in claw-free graphs are given in Section [\ref=clfree]. In Section [\ref=domination] we discuss the relation between Λ-packing and domination problems and provide some bounds on the graph domination numbers based on some Λ-packing results. Finally, in Section [\ref=related-results] we explore the relation between packing problems of a graph and its line graph to obtain some results on different types of packings. We also discuss the induced Λ-packing problem and its relation with the Hadwiger conjecture.

Main notions, notation, and simple observations

As usual, V(G) and E(G) denote the set of vertices and edges of G, respectively, and v(G)  =  |V(G)|, e(G)  =  |E(G)|. If P is a path with the end-vertices x and y, we put End(P)  =  {x,y}. Given X  ⊆  E(G), let [formula] denote the subgraph of G induced by X. Given x∈V(G), let N(x,G)  =  N(x) denote the set of vertices in G adjacent to x. Let Cmp(G) denote the set of components of G and cmp(G)  =  |Cmp(G)|. Let λ(G) denote the maximum number of disjoint 3-vertex paths in G. A vertex subset X of G is called a domination set in G, if every vertex in [formula] is adjacent to a vertex in X. Let γ(G) denote the size of a minimum domination set in G; γ(G) is called the domination number of G. A leaf in a graph is a vertex of degree one. Let Lv(G) denote the set of leaves in G and lv(G)  =  |Lv(G)|.

A claw is a graph isomorphic to K1,3, i.e. the graph with four vertices and three edges having a common end-vertex. A graph is called claw-free if it contains no induced claw. A net is a graph obtained from a triangle with three vertices x1, x2, and x3 by adding three new vertices z1, z2, and z3 and three new edges x1z1, x2z2, and x3z3. A graph with one edge and two vertices is called a match.

A graph G is minimal 2-connected if G is 2-connected but G  -  e is not 2-connected for every e∈E(G). A 2-frame (or simply, a frame) of G is a minimal 2-connected spanning subgraph of G.

Given a subgraph S of a graph G, a vertex x∈V(S) is a boundary vertex of S if x is adjacent to a vertex in G  -  S and an inner vertex of S, otherwise.

A block of a connected graph G is a maximal connected subgraph H of G such that H  -  v is connected for every vertex v of H, and so H is either 2-connected or a match. If B has at most one boundary vertex, then B is called an end-block of G. Let eb(G) denote the number of end-blocks of connected graph G, and so if eb(G)  =  1, then G is either 2-connected or a match.

We call a graph H a chain if H is connected and has at most two end-blocks. An end-chain of G is a maximal proper subgraph H of G such that H is a chain, every block of H is a block of G with at most two boundary vertices in G, and H contains an end-block of G. Obviously, a connected graph G has an end-chain if and only if G has at least three end-blocks. Also if G has end-chains, then every end-block of G is a subgraph (moreover, an end-block) of exactly one end-chain of G and every end-chain of G contains exactly one end-block of G.

We call a graph G a Δ-graph if G is cubic and every vertex of G belongs to exactly one triangle, and so a Δ-graph is a claw-free graph.

We call a graph G a cactus if G is connected, G has at least three end-blocks, and each end-chain of G is a match.

Given a graph G, we write G  =  AxB if A and B are graphs, [formula], and [formula], and so if A and B are connected graphs with at least two vertices, then G is connected and x is a cut-vertex of G.

We recall that a Λ-packing in a graph G is a subgraph of G whose every component is a 3-vertex graph and a Λ-factor in G is a spanning Λ-packing of G. In addition, a Λ-packing P in G is called a Λ-quasi-factor of G if v(G)  -  v(P)  ≤  2. We will use the following simple facts.

Preliminaries and an outline of new results

In [\cite=K] [\cite=KM] we gave an answer to the following natural question: How many disjoint 3-vertex paths must a cubic n-vertex graph have? Obviously, λ(G)  ≤  ⌊v(G) / 3⌋.

Obviously, if every component of G is K4, then λ(G)  =  v(G) / 4. Therefore the bound in [\ref=km] is sharp. Let G32 denote the set of graphs with each vertex of degree 2 or 3. In [\cite=K] we gave (among other things) an answer to the following question: How many disjoint 3-vertex paths must an n-vertex graph from G32 have?

From [\ref=2] [\ref=3-graphs] it follows that every cubic graph G has at least v(G) / 4 disjoint 3-vertex paths [\cite=KM] because if G is a cubic graph, then G∈G32 and G has no 5-vertex components. In [\cite=K] we also gave a construction that allowed to prove the following:

Here are some packing results on regular graphs.

There are infinitely many 2-connected cubic graphs G having no Λ-quasi-factors. Some of such graphs were constructed in [\cite=Kcntrex] to provide 2-connected counterexamples to Reed's domination conjecture (see Section [\ref=domination]). In particular, a graph sequence (Rk:k  ≥  3) in [\cite=Kcntrex] is such that each Rk is a cubic graph of connectivity two, v(Rk)  =  20k, and [formula]. Obviously, γ(G)  ≤  v(G)  -  2λ(G). Therefore [formula]. Questions arise whether there are 2-connected cubic graphs with some additional properties and without Λ-quasi-factors. For example,

In [\cite=K2con-cbp] we answered the question in [\ref=Pr2con] [\ref=cub] [\ref=bip] [\ref=pl] by giving a construction that provides infinitely many 2-connected, cubic, bipartite, and planar graphs without Λ-quasi-factors. As to cubic 3-connected graphs, an old open question here is:

In [\cite=K3con-cub] we discuss Problem [\ref=Pr3con] and show, in particular, that claim [formula] in [\ref=Pr3con] is equivalent to some seemingly much stronger claims. Here are some results of this kind.

There are some interesting results on the Λ-packing problem for claw-free graphs. Recall that a graph is called claw-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to a claw.

From [\ref=eb(G)clfr] we have, in particular:

As we have mentioned in Section [\ref=Introduction], the Λ-packing problem remains NP-hard in the class of all graphs and even in the class of cubic graphs [\cite=HK] [\cite=K1]. It would be interesting to answer the following question.

In this paper (see Section [\ref=clfree]) we give some more results on the Λ-packings in claw-free graphs showing, in particular, to what extent the claims in [\ref=cubic3-conZTF] - [\ref=cubic3-conF] are true for claw-free graphs. Here are some of these results. (c1) If G is a 2-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then for every edge e in G there exists a Λ-factor of G avoiding e, i.e. G  -  e has a Λ-factor (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conZ] (z1) and [\ref=2conclfr] (a1)). (c2) If G is a 3-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then for every edge e in G there exists a Λ-factor of G containing e (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=einL] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conZ] (z2) and [\ref=2conclfr] (a1)). (c3) If G is a cubic 2-connected claw-free graph with every vertex belonging to exactly one triangle and E is a set of two edges in G, then G  -  E has a Λ-factor (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid(a] [\ref=b)] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conZ] (z3)). (c4) If G is a cubic 3-connected claw-free graph with v(G)  ≥  6 and E is a set of three edges in G, then G  -  E has a Λ-factor if and only if the subgraph induced by E in G is not a claw and not a triangle (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid(a] [\ref=b] [\ref=c)]). (c5) If G is a cubic 3-connected claw-free graph or a 4-connected claw-free graph with [formula], then for every 3-vertex path L in G there exists a Λ-factor containing L, i.e. G  -  L has a Λ-factor (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=4con] [\ref=deg3cntrL-] and [\ref=2con] [\ref=cubic] [\ref=tr] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conZ] (z4)). (c6) If G is a 2-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then for every vertex x in G there exist two edge xy and xz in G such that G  -  {x,y} and G  -  {x,z} have Λ-factors (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] and [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con] [\ref=(x] [\ref=y)-] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conT] (t1) and [\ref=2conclfr] (a3)). (c7) If G is a 3-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then G  -  {x,y} has a Λ-factor for every edge xy in G (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=(x] [\ref=y)-] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conT] (t2) and [\ref=2conclfr] (a3)). (c8) If G is a 3-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then G has a 5-vertex path W such that G  -  W has a Λ-factor, and so G has a {P3,P5}-factor (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] (a2) and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conT] (t3)). (c9) If G is a 2-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then G  -  x has a Λ-factor for every vertex x in G (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con] [\ref=x-] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conF] (f1) and [\ref=2conclfr] (a2)). (c10) If G is a 3-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then G  -  {x,e} has a Λ-factor for every vertex x and every edge e in G (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=(x] [\ref=e)-] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conF] (f2)). (c11) If G is a 2-connected claw-free graph and [formula], then there exist a 4-vertex path Π and a claw Y in G such that G  -  Π and G  -  Y have Λ-factors, and so G has a {P3,P4}-factor and {P3,Y}-factor (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] (a2) and [\ref=G-Y] and compare with [\ref=cubic3-conF] (f3) and [\ref=Ham]). (c12) We show that the Λ-packing problem for a claw-free graph G can be reduced in polynomial time to that for a special claw-free graph K (called a cactus) with v(K)  ≤  v(G) (see [\ref=reduction] and [\ref=lambda(G)=]). (c13) If G is a 2-connected claw-free graph, then γ(G)  ≤  ⌈v(G) / 3⌉ and if in addition G is not a cycle and [formula], then γ(G)  ≤  ⌊v(G) / 3⌋ (see [\ref=gamma]).

Main results on claw-free graphs

We will often use the following combination of [\ref=2conclfr] and [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks].

Recall that G  =  AxB is the union of graphs A and B with [formula]. We need the following bounds on λ(AxB).

Proof. Let S be a maximum Λ-packing in G. [formula] Suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] and S2  =  S  -  S1. Then λ(S1)  ≤  v(A) / 3.

Suppose that x∈V(S1). Then λ(S2)  =  λ(B  -  x), and so λ(S)  =  λ(S1)  +  λ(S2)  ≤  v(A) / 3  +  λ(B  -  x).

Now suppose that [formula]. Then λ(S1)  ≤  v(A) / 3  -  1. Let [formula] and S''2  =  S2  -  S'2. Then λ(S'2)  ≤  λ(B  -  x). If L is a 3-vertex path in S''2, then x∈V(L). Hence λ(S''2)  ≤  1. Therefore λ(S2)  =  λ(S'2)  +  λ(S''2)  ≤  λ(B  -  x)  +  1. Thus, λ(S)  =  λ(S1)  +  λ(S2)  ≤  (v(A) / 3  -  1)  +  λ(B  -  x)  +  1  =  v(A) / 3  +  λ(B  -  x). [formula] Suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] and S2  =  S  -  S'.

Suppose that λ(S1)  =  v(A  -  x) / 3. Then λ(S2)  =  λ(B), and so λ(S)  =  λ(S1)  +  λ(S2)  =  v(A) / 3  +  λ(B  -  x).

Now suppose that λ(S1)  ≤  v(A  -  x) / 3  -  1. Let [formula] and S''2  =  S2  -  S'2. Then λ(S'2)  ≤  λ(B). If L is a 3-vertex path in S''2, then x∈V(L). Hence λ(S''2)  ≤  1. Therefore λ(S2)  =  λ(S'2)  +  λ(S''2)  ≤  λ(B)  +  1. Thus, λ(S)  =  λ(S1)  +  λ(S2)  ≤  (v(A) / 3  -  1)  +  λ(B)  +  1  =  v(A) / 3  +  λ(B). [formula] Finally, suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] for some xy∈E(A) and S2  =  S  -  S1. Let [formula] and S''2  =  S2  -  S'2. Then [formula]. Suppose that λ(S1)  =  v(A  -  {x,y}) / 3. Then [formula], and so λ(S)  =  λ(S1)  +  λ(S2)  =  v(A  -  {x,y}) / 3  +  λ(B). Suppose that λ(S1)  =  v(A  -  {x,y}) / 3  -  1. If L is a 3-vertex path in S''2, then V(L)  ⊂  V(A  -  S1). Since λ(S1)  =  v(A  -  {x,y}) / 3  -  1, we have: |V(A  -  S1)|  =  5. Hence λ(S''2)  ≤  1. Therefore λ(S2)  =  λ(S'2)  +  λ(S''2)  ≤  λ(B)  +  1. Thus, [formula]. Now suppose that λ(S1)  =  v(A  -  {x,y}) / 3  -  2. If L is a 3-vertex path in S''2, then [formula]. Hence λ(S''2)  ≤  2. Therefore λ(S2)  =  λ(S'2)  +  λ(S''2)  ≤  λ(B)  +  2. Thus, we have: [formula]. [formula] It turns out that the end-chains of a claw-free graph have some special Λ-packing properties.

Proof (uses [\ref=eb<3]). Let bx∈E(C). Since G is claw-free, C  -  {b,x} is also claw-free. If there exists an edge bb' in C such that eb(C  -  {b,b'})  ≤  2, then we are done by [\ref=eb<3].

Let B be the end-block of C containing b, and so b is a boundary vertex of B. Since G is claw-free, B and B  -  {b,x} are also claw-free for bx∈E(B) and N(x,B) induces a complete subgraph K in B. [formula] Suppose that B has exactly one edge bb'. Since v(C)  ≥  3, there is a (unique) block B' in C such that b' is a boundary vertex of B'. If e(B')  =  1, then eb(C  -  {b,b'})  ≤  2 and we are done. If e(B')  ≥  2, then B' is 2-connected. Since N(b',B') induces a complete subgraph in B', clearly B'  -  b' is either 2-connected or a match. Therefore again eb(C  -  {b,b'})  ≤  2 and we are done. [formula] Now suppose that B has at least two edges, and so B is 2-connected. Then eb(B  -  {b,x})  ≤  2 for every edge bx in B. Therefore if B  =  C, then we are done. So we assume that B  ≠  C, and so C has the end-block D distinct from B. If there is an edge bb' in B such that eb(B  -  {b,b'}) = 1, then eb(C  -  {b,b'})  ≤  2 and we are done. So we assume that eb(B  -  {b,x}) = 2 for every vertex x in K. Then v(K)  ≥  2. Let B1(x) and B2(x) be the two end-blocks of B  -  {b,x}, where B1(x) has no vertex adjacent to b. Since eb(B  -  {b,x}) = 2, clearly B1(x) and B2(x) are 2-connected for every edge bx in B. Since B  ≠  D, clearly eb(C  -  {b,x})  =  3. Since G is claw-free, Cx  =  C  -  (K  -  x) is also claw-free. Since bx is an end-block of Cx, clearly N(x,Cx  -  b) induces in Cx  -  b a complete subgraph Kx. Now since B1(x) has a vertex adjacent to x, clearly Kx  ⊆  B1(x). Since B2(x) is 2-connected, K  -  x has an inner vertex z of B2(x). Since K  -  x is a complete graph and B2(x) is 2-connected, we have: K  -  x  ⊆  B2(x).

First we assume that v(K)  ≥  3, and so there is vertex y in K  -  {x,z}. Then y∈B2(x), and so in B  -  {b,z}, vertex x is adjacent to B1(x) and B2(x)  -  z. Therefore B  -  {b,z} is 2-connected, and so eb(B  -  {b,z}) = 1, a contradiction.

Now we assume that v(K)  =  2, say, V(K)  =  {b1  =  x,b2  =  y}. Let B1 be the subgraph of B induced by [formula] and B2  =  B2(x). Then N(b1,C  -  b  -  b2)  =  N(b1,B1), N(b2,C  -  b  -  b1) = N(b2,B2), and each N(bi,Bi) induces in Bi a complete subgraph. Let B'i  =  Bi  -  bi. Clearly, B'1  =  B1(b1)  =  B1(x). Since B1(x) is 2-connected, B'1 is 2-connected. Since B2  =  B2(x) is 2-connected, B'i is either 2-connected or a match. Obviously, B'1, B'2, and D are the three end-blocks of C  -  {b,b1,b2}. Let Ci be the end-chain in C  -  {b,b1,b2} containing B'i and ci be the boundary vertex of Ci. Let Ci  =  C  -  {b,bi} and B'i be the subgraph of C induces by [formula]. [formula] Suppose that [formula] for some i∈{1,2}, say, for i  =  1. Obviously, C1  -  (C1  -  c1) has exactly two end-blocks (namely, B'2 and D).

Since c1 is a vertex in C1  -  (C1  -  c1) and the boundary vertex of Ci, the neighborhood of c1 in C1  -  (C1  -  c1) induces a complete subgraph in C1  -  (C1  -  c1). Therefore C1  -  C1 has also two end-blocks (namely, B'2 and D). By [\ref=eb<3], λ(C1  -  C1)  =  ⌊v(C1  -  C1) / 3⌋. Since C1 is a chain and [formula], by [\ref=eb<3], λ(C1)  =  v(C1) / 3. Thus, λ(C1)  =  λ(C1  -  C1)  +  v(C1) / 3  =  ⌊v(C1) / 3⌋. [formula] Suppose that [formula] for some i∈{1,2}, say i  =  1. Since c1 is the boundary vertex of end-chain C1 in C1, the neighborhood of c1 in C1 induces a complete subgraph in C1. Therefore C1  -  c1 is a chain. Since [formula], clearly [formula]. Therefore by [\ref=eb<3], λ(C1  -  c1)  =  v(C1  -  c1) / 3. Obviously, C1  -  (C1  -  c1) is a chain. By [\ref=eb<3], λ(C1  -  (C1  -  c1))  =  ⌊v(C1  -  (C1  -  c1)) / 3⌋. Thus, λ(C1)  =  λ(C1  -  C1)  +  v(C1  -  c1) / 3  =  ⌊v(C1) / 3⌋. [formula] Finally, suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Let C'1 denote the end-chain in C2 containing B'1. Then C1  ⊂  C'1 and v(C'1)  =  v(C1)  +  1  =  0 mod 3. Now the arguments similar to those in [formula] shows that our claim is true. [formula] Now we can improve bounds on λ(G) in [\ref=lambda(AxB)<] when G  =  AxB is claw-free and A is an end-chain of G.

Proof (uses [\ref=eb<3], [\ref=lambda(AxB)<], and [\ref=chain2mod3]). Suppose that [formula]. Then by [\ref=eb<3], A has a Λ-factor P. Let Q be a maximum Λ-packing in B  -  x. Then [formula] is a Λ-packing in G and [formula]. Therefore by [\ref=lambda(AxB)<] (a0), λ(G) = v(A) / 3  +  λ(B  -  x).

Suppose that [formula]. Then by [\ref=eb<3], A - x has a Λ-factor P. Let Q be a maximum Λ-packing in B. Then [formula] is a Λ-packing in G and [formula]. Therefore by [\ref=lambda(AxB)<] (a1), λ(G) = (v(A) - 1) / 3  +  λ(B).

Finally, suppose that [formula]. Then by [\ref=chain2mod3], there exists an edge xy in A such that A - {x,y} has a Λ-factor P. Let Q be a maximum Λ-packing in B. Then [formula] is a Λ-packing in G and [formula]. Therefore by [\ref=lambda(AxB)<] (a2), [formula]. [formula] Theorem [\ref=lambda(AxB)=] suggests the following reduction procedure for claw-free graphs. Let G be a connected claw-free graph, C an end-chain of G, and c the boundary vertex of C. Let us define a graph ⌊C⌋ as follows: if [formula] and v(C)  ≥  3, then ⌊C⌋  =  C, if [formula] and v(C)  ≥  4, then ⌊C⌋  =  C  -  c, and if [formula] and v(C)  ≥  5, then ⌊C⌋  =  C  -  {c,c'}, where cc' is an edge in C such that λ(C  -  {c,c'})  =  ⌊v(C  -  {c,c'} / 3)⌋ (see [\ref=chain2mod3]).

Obviously, v(⌊C⌋) / 3  =  ⌊v(C) / 3⌋. Recall that a graph G is called a cactus if G is connected and has at least three end-chains and each end-chain has exactly two vertices. The following procedure for claw-free graphs allows to either find a Λ-factor in a graph G or to reduce the Λ-packing problem for G to that for a cactus K with v(K)  ≤  v(G).

Obviously, Reduction [\ref=reduction] is a polynomial-time procedure.

Let [formula]. Clearly all Di's are disjoint, and so [formula].

It follows that Gk in Reduction [\ref=reduction] is either a claw-free chain or a claw-free cactus. It is easy to show that if Gk is a cactus, then Dk and Gk are uniquely defined; in this case let us denote Dk by D(G) and Gk by R(G).

Proof   (uses [\ref=eb(G)clfr], [\ref=eb<3], [\ref=chain2mod3], and [\ref=reduction]). We prove (a1) and (a2). By Reduction [\ref=reduction], each Di has at most two end-blocks and [formula]. Since G is claw-free, each Di is also claw-free. By [\ref=eb<3], each Di has a Λ-factor Pi, and so λ(Pi)  =  λ(Di)  =  v(Di) / 3. Therefore (a1) holds. If Gk is a chain, then by the same reason, Q is a Λ-factor of Gk. Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of G, and so (a2) holds. Now (a3) follows from [\ref=lambda(AxB)=] and (a4) follows from (a3) and [\ref=eb(G)clfr]. [formula] From [\ref=reduction] and [\ref=lambda(G)=] it follows that Problem [\ref=claw-freeLpacNPhard] is equivalent to

Now we describe an infinite class of sub-cubic claw-free graphs with no Λ factors. This class includes infinitely many cacti. We will use this description to establish some Λ-packing properties of Δ-graphs (see [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid(a] [\ref=b] [\ref=c)]). Let S denote the set of graphs S with the following properties: (α1) S is connected, (α2) every vertex in S has degree at most 3, (α3) every vertex in S of degree 2 or 3 belongs to exactly one triangle, and (α4) S has at least three leaves.

Proof     Let S∈S. If [formula], then our claim is obviously true. So we assume that [formula]. By (α3), [formula], and so [formula]. Obviously, it is sufficient to prove our claim for S∈S with property (α'4): lv(A)  =  3. We prove our claim by induction on v(G). The smallest graph in S is a net N with v(N)  =  6 and our claim is obviously true for N. So let v(S)  ≥  9. Suppose, on the contrary, that S has a Λ-factor P. Let v be a leaf of S and vx the edge incident to v. Since P is a Λ-factor in S, it has a component L  =  vxy, and so P  -  L is a Λ-factor in S  -  L and d(x,S)  ≥  2. By property (c3), x belongs to a unique triangle xyz in A and d(x,a)  =  3. If d(z,S)  =  2, then z is an isolated vertex in S  -  L, and so P is not a Λ-factor in S, a contradiction. Therefore by (c2), d(z,S)  =  3. Hence z is a leaf in S  -  L, and so lv(S  -  L)  =  3. Therefore S  -  L satisfies (α2), (α3), and (α'4).

Suppose that G  -  L is not connected and that the three leaves do not belong to a common component. Then S  -  L has a component C with [formula], and so S  -  L has no Λ-factor, a contradiction.

Finally, suppose that S  -  L has a component C containing all three leaves of S  -  L. Then C∈S and v(C)  <  v(S). By the induction hypothesis, C has no Λ-factor. Therefore S  -  L also has no Λ-factor, a contradiction. [formula] Recall that a frame of G is a minimal 2-connected spanning subgraph of G. We need the following procedure from [\cite=KKN] that provides a frame of a 2-connected graph. This procedure was used in [\cite=KKN] to prove [\ref=2conclfr].

If G is a 2-connected graph, then we put F(G)  =  Gr, A(G)  =  Ar, and A(G)  =  A in Procedure E. Clearly, every 2-connected graph has a frame. It is easy to see the following.

We will also need the following modification of Procedure E. Recall that an edge e  =  xy is a chord of a cycle C in G if [formula] and x,y∈V(C).

Since G is 2-connected, G has a cycle containing e. Therefore a cycle A'0 exists. It turns out [\cite=KKN] that applied to a 2-connected claw-free graph G, Procedure E provides a frame F(G)  =  Gr of G and its ear-assembly with very useful properties.

Recall that a claw-free frame of G is a minimal 2-connected claw-free spanning subgraph of G. Clearly, every 2-connected claw-free graph has a claw-free frame.

Obviously, even the first steps in Procedures E and E' are NP-hard. However, there are modifications of these procedures which find F(G), Fc(G), A(G), and A(G) with properties in [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free] in polynomial time for every 2-connected claw-free graph G.

Proof  (uses [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free]). We prove (a1) by induction on v(G). If G is a cycle, then our claim is obviously true. Otherwise, consider A  =  A(G) provided by Procedure E'. Then [formula]. Let P be a maximum Λ-packing in A(G). Since e(A)  ≥  2, clearly v(P)  =  3s for some s  ≥  1. Therefore [formula] and by [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free], G  -  P is also a 2-connected claw-free graph. Since [formula], clearly [formula]. Obviously, v(G  -  P)  <  v(G). By the induction hypothesis, G  -  P has a Λ-factor Q avoiding e. Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of G avoiding edge e. The proof of (a2) is similar to that above. [formula] It turns out that an analogue of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] (a2) when a 4-vertex path is replaced by a claw is also true provided a graph has a claw.

Proof (uses [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks] and [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free]). Let H  =  Fc(G) and A  =  A(G) (see [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free]), and so A  ⊂  H. Suppose first that A is a cycle. Then A is a Hamiltonian cycle of H. Since G is not a cycle, we have by [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free] (f2): [formula] and every edge in [formula] belongs to a unique triangle in H. Then H has at least two claws and H  -  Y has a Λ-factor for every claw in H. Since H is a spanning subgraph of G, every Λ-factor of H  -  Y is also a Λ-factor of G  -  Y.

Now suppose that A is a path. Let x and y be the end-vertices of A. Since H is a spanning subgraph of G, it suffices to prove the following Claim. For every vertex v∈{x,y} there exist two claws Yv an Zv in H such that either G  -  Yv or G  -  Zv has a Λ-factor. Proof. By [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free], every end-vertex of A has degree three and belongs to a unique triangle of H. By symmetry, we can assume that v  =  y. Let Δ be the triangle containing y and V(Δ)  =  {s,y,z}. Let Y and Z be the claws in H centered at y and z, respectively. Then Y contains the end-edge yy' of L and Z contains the edge zz', where [formula]. Let H'  =  H  -  A. By [\ref=frame] [\ref=claw-free] (f3), H' is a 2-connected claw-free spanning subgraph of G  -  A. [formula] Suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] and H0  =  H  -  R0. Then A'  =  R0  -  Y  =  A  -  {x,y,y'} is the subpath of R0. Since [formula], also [formula]. Then A' has a unique Λ-factor P. Let H''  =  H  -  (A  -  x). Obviously, H0  =  H''  -  {s,z}. Since H' is 2-connected, H'' is also 2-connected. Since s and z have degree three in H, they both have degree two in H''. Therefore H0  =  H''  -  {s,z} has exactly two end-blocks. Since H is claw-free, H0 is also claw-free. By [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks], H0 has a Λ-factor Q. Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of [formula]. [formula] Suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] and H0  =  H  -  R0. Then L'  =  R0  -  Z  =  L  -  y is the subpath of R0. Since [formula], clearly [formula]. Then A' has a unique Λ-factor P. Since s and z have degree three in H, they both have degree two in H'. Now since H' is 2-connected, H0  =  H'  -  {s,z,z'} has exactly two end-blocks. Since H is claw-free, H0 is also claw-free. By [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks], H0 has a Λ-factor Q. Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of [formula]. [formula] Suppose that [formula]. Let [formula] and H0  =  H  -  R0. Then A'  =  R0  -  Y  =  A  -  {y,y'} is the subpath of R0. Since [formula], clearly [formula]. Then A' has a unique Λ-factor P. Since s and z have degree three in H, they both have degree two in H'. Now since H' is 2-connected, H0  =  H'  -  {s,z} has exactly two end-blocks. Since H is claw-free, H0 is also claw-free. By [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks], H0 has a Λ-factor Q. Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of [formula]. [formula] By [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] (a2), every 2-connected claw-free graph with [formula] has an edge xy such that G  -  {x,y} has a Λ-factor. It turns that the following stronger result is true.

Proof     (uses [\ref=eb<3], [\ref=reduction], and [\ref=lambda(G)=]). Since G is 2-connected, there exists an edge xy in G such that G  -  {x,y} is connected. Suppose that G  -  {x,y} has no Λ - factor. Then by [\ref=eb<3], G  -  {x,y} has at least three end-blocks Bi, [formula], k  ≥  3. Let b'i be the boundary vertex of block Bi in G  -  {x,y}. Let Vi be the set of vertices in {x,y} adjacent to a vertex in Bi  -  b'i and Bv be the set of the end-blocks in G  -  {x,y} having an inner vertex adjacent to v∈{x,y}. Since G is 2-connected, each |Vi|  ≥  1. Since G is claw-free, each |Bv|  ≤  2. Since k  ≥  3, |Bz|  =  2 for some z∈{x,y}, say Bz  =  {B1,B2}. Let zbi∈E(G), where bi∈V(Bi  -  b'i) for i∈{1,2}. Since G is claw-free, {x,y,b1,b2} does not induce a claw in G. Therefore sbj∈E(G) for {s,z}  =  {x,y} and some j∈{1,2}, say, for j  =  2. Then Bs  =  {Bi:i  ≥  2}. Since Bs  =  2, we have: k  =  3 and Bs  =  {B2,B3}. Now we can assume that z  =  x and s  =  y. Obviously, G  -  {x,b1} is claw-free, connected, and has exactly two end-blocks. By [\ref=eb<3], G  -  {x,b1} has a Λ-factor.

We want to prove that G  -  {x,b2} also has a Λ-factor. Let Ci be the end-chain of G  -  {x,y} containing Bi, i∈{1,2,3}. Graph G  -  {x,y} is claw-free and has exactly three end-blocks. Since G  -  {x,y} has no Λ-factor, by [\ref=lambda(G)=] (a3), a graph Gk obtained from G by Reduction [\ref=reduction] has exactly three end-chains and each of them has one edge. Therefore each [formula]. Graph G  -  {x,b2} is claw-free, connected, and has a leaf y and two or three end-chains. If G  -  {x,b2} has two end-chains, then by [\ref=eb<3], G  -  {x,b2} has a Λ-factor. So we assume that G  -  {x,b2} has three end-chains C'1, C'1, and C'1, where b'1∈V(C'1) and b'3∈V(C'3). Then C'1  =  C1, C'2  =  C2  -  b'2, and C'3 is obtained from C3 by adding edge yb3. Since [formula], clearly [formula]. Then a graph Gk obtained from G by Reduction [\ref=reduction] has two end-blocks. Therefore by [\ref=lambda(G)=] (a3), G  -  {x,b2} has a Λ-factor. [formula] From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con] [\ref=(x] [\ref=y)-] we have for 3-connected claw-free graphs the following stronger result (with a simpler proof).

Proof     (uses [\ref=eb<3]). Let G'  =  G  -  {x,y}. Since G is 3-connected, G' is connected. By [\ref=eb<3], it suffices to prove that G' has at most two end-blocks. Suppose, on the contrary, that G' has at least three end-blocks. Let Bi, i∈{1,2,3}, be some three blocks of G'. Since G is 3-connected, for every block Bi and every vertex v∈{x,y} there is an edge vbi, where bi is an inner vertex of Bi. Then {v,b1,b2,b3} induces a claw in G, a contradiction. [formula] As we have seen in the proof of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con] [\ref=(x] [\ref=y)-], the claim of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=(x] [\ref=y)-] is not true for claw-free graphs of connectivity two.

Proof     (uses [\ref=eb<3]). We need the following simple fact. Claim. Let G be a 3-connected graph. Then for every vertex x and every edge xy in G there exist two 3-vertex paths Λ1 and Λ2 in G centered at y, containing xy, and such that each G  -  Λi is connected. By the above Claim, G has a 3-vertex path L  =  xyz such that G  -  L is connected. If every such 3-vertex path belongs to a Λ-factor of G, then we are done. Therefore we assume that G  -  L is connected but has no Λ-factor. Obviously, G  -  L is claw-free. Therefore by [\ref=eb<3], G  -  L has at least three end-blocks Bi, [formula], k  ≥  3. Let b'i be the boundary vertex of Bi. Let Vi be the set of vertices in L adjacent to inner vertices G  -  L having an inner vertex adjacent to v in V(L). Since G is 3-connected, each |Vi|  ≥  2. Since G is claw-free, each |Bv|  ≤  2. It follows that k  =  3, each |Vi|  =  2, each |Bv|  =  2, as well as all Vi's are different and all Bv's are different. Let s1  =  z, s2  =  x, s3  =  y, and S  =  {s1,s2,s3}. We can assume that Vi  =  S  -  si, i∈{1,2,3}. Then for every vertex sj∈Vi there is a vertex bji in Bi  -  b'i adjacent to sj, where {bji:sj∈Vi} has exactly one vertex if and only if Bi  -  b'i has exactly one vertex. Let Li  =  s2s3bi, where bi  =  b3i. By [\ref=eb<3], it suffices to show that each G  -  Li is connected and has at most two end-blocks.

Let i  =  1. If B1  -  b1 is 2-connected, then B1  -  b1 and G  -  L1  -  (B1  -  b'1) are the two end-blocks of G  -  L1 and we are done. If B1  -  b1 is empty, then G  -  L1 is 2-connected. So we assume that B1  -  b1 is not empty and not 2-connected. Then B1  -  b1 is connected and has exactly two end-blocks, say C1 and C2. Let c'i be the boundary vertex of Ci in B1  -  b1. Since G is 3-connected, each Ci - c'i has a vertex adjacent to {s2,s3}. We can assume that a vertex c1 in C1  -  c'1 is adjacent to s2. If there exists a vertex c2 in C2  -  c'2 adjacent to s2, then {s2,b23,c1,c2} induces a claw in G, a contradiction. So we assume that no vertex in C2  -  c'2 is adjacent to s2. Then there is a vertex c2 in C2  -  c'2 adjacent to s3. Then {s2,s3,b32,c2} induces a claw in G, a contradiction.

Finally, let i  =  2. If B2  -  b2 is 2-connected, then B1 and G  -  L2  -  (B1  -  b'1) are the two end-blocks of G  -  L2 and we are done. If B1  -  b1 is empty, then G  -  L2 has two end-blocks, namely, B1 and the subgraph of G induced by [formula]. So we assume that B2  -  b2 is not empty and not 2-connected. Then B2  -  b2 is connected and has exactly two end-blocks, say D1 and D2. Let d'i be the boundary vertex of Di in B2  -  b2. Since G is 3-connected, each Di - d'i has a vertex adjacent to {s1,s3}. We can assume that a vertex d1 in D1  -  d'1 is adjacent to s3. If there exists a vertex d2 in D2  -  d'2 adjacent to s3, then {s3,d1,d2,b31} induces a claw in G, a contradiction. So suppose that no vertex in D2  -  d'2 is adjacent to s3. Then there is a vertex d2 in D2  -  d'2 adjacent to s1. Then {s1,s3,b13,d2} induces a claw in G, a contradiction. [formula] From the proof of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=L-] we have, in particular:

From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=deg3cntrL-] and the proof of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=L-] we have:

The claim of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=4con] [\ref=deg3cntrL-] may not be true for a claw-free graph of connectivity 3 if they are not cubic. Recall that a net is a graph obtained from a claw by replacing its vertex of degree 3 by a triangle. Let N be a net with the three leaves v1, v2, and v3, T a triangle with V(T)  =  {t1,t2,t3}, and let N and T be disjoint. Let [formula]. Then H is a 3-connected claw-free graph, v(H)  =  9, each d(ti,H)  =  4, d(x,H)  =  3 for every x∈V(H  -  T), and H  -  T  =  N has no Λ-factor. If L is a 3-vertex path in T, then H  -  L  =  H  -  T, and so H  -  L has no Λ-factor. There are infinitely many pairs (G,L) such that G is a 3-connected, claw-free, and non-cubic graph, [formula], L is a 3-vertex path in G, and G  -  L has no Λ-factor.

By [\ref=A], such a pair can be obtained from the above pair (H,L) by replacing N by any graph A with exactly three leaves satisfying the assumptions of [\ref=A]. From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=L-] we have, in particular:

The following examples show that assumption " G is a 3-connected graph" in [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=einL] is essential. Let R be the graph obtained from two disjoint cycles A and B by adding a new vertex z, and the set of four new edges {aiz,biz:i∈{1,2}}, where a  =  a1a2∈E(A) and b  =  b1b2∈E(B). It is easy to see that R is a claw-free graph of connectivity one. Furthermore, if [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and R has no Λ-factor containing edge e∈{a,b}. Similarly, let Q be the graph obtained from two disjoint cycles A and B by adding two new vertices z1 and z2, a new edge e  =  z1z2, and the set of eight new edges {aizj,bizj:i,j∈{1,2}}, where a1a2∈E(A) and b1b2∈E(B). It is easy to see that Q is a claw-free graph of connectivity two. Furthermore, if [formula] and [formula], then [formula] and Q has no Λ-factor containing edge e. Let F be a graph, x∈V(F), and X  =  {x1,x2,x3} be the set of vertices in F adjacent to x. Let T be a triangle, V(T)  =  {t1,t2,t3}, and [formula]. Let [formula]. We say that G is obtained from F by replacing a vertex x by a triangle.

Given a cubic graph F with possible parallel edges, let FΔ denote the graph obtained from F by replacing each vertex of F by a triangle. Clearly, FΔ is cubic and claw-free, every vertex belongs to exactly one triangle, every edge belongs to at most one triangle in FΔ, and [formula]. Obviously, FΔ is k-connected if and only if F is k-connected, k∈{1,2,3}. We call FΔ a Δ-graph.

Proof     Since G is a 2-connected Δ-graph, G can be obtained from a 2-connected cubic graph G' (with possible parallel edges) by replacing each vertex of G' by a triangle. Obviously, there is a natural bijection α:E(G')  →  E'. Let E' be the set of edges in G that belong to no triangle. Let L  =  xzz1. Since each vertex of G belongs to exactly one triangle, we can assume that xz belongs to a triangle T  =  xzs. [formula] Suppose that L induces a triangle in G, and so s  =  z1. Obviously the union of all triangles in G contains a Λ-factor, say P, of G and L  ⊂  P. Therefore claim (a1) is true. [formula] Now suppose that L does not induce a triangle in G, and so s  ≠  z1. Let s̄  =  ss1 and   =  zz1 be the edges of G not belonging to T, and therefore belonging to no triangles in G. Hence s̄  =  α(s̄') and   =  α('), where s̄'  =  s's'1 and '  =  z'z'1 are edges in G', and s'  =  z'. Since every vertex in G belongs to exactly one triangle, clearly s1  ≠  z1. [formula] We prove (a2). By using Tutte's criterion for a graph to have a perfect matching (see [\cite=LP]), it is easy to prove the following Claim. If A is a cubic 2-connected graph, then for every 3-vertex path J of A there exists a 2-factor of A containing J. By the above Claim, G' has a 2-factor F' containing 3-vertex path S'  =  s'1s'z'1. Let C' be the (cycle) component of F' containing S'. If Q' is a (cycle) component of F', then let Q be the subgraph of G, induced by the edge subset [formula]. Obviously [formula] and Q has a (unique) Hamiltonian cycle H(Q). Also the union F of all Q's is a spanning subgraph of G and each Q is a component of F. Moreover, if C is the component in F, corresponding to C', then L  ⊂  H(C). Therefore each H(Q) has a Λ-factor P(Q), such that no component of P(Q) induces a triangle, and H(C) has a (unique) Λ-factor P(C), such that L  ⊂  P(C) and no component of P(C) induces a triangle. The union of all these Λ-factors is a Λ-factor P of G containing L and such that no component of P induces a triangle. Therefore (a2) holds. [formula] Finally, we prove (a3). Since G' is 2-connected and cubic, there is a cycle C' in G' such that V(C')  ≠  V(G') and C' contains S'  =  s'1s'z'1. Let, as above, C be the subgraph of G, induced by the edge subset [formula]. Obviously, [formula], C has a (unique) Hamiltonian cycle H, and L  ⊂  H. Therefore H has a (unique) Λ-factor P(C) containing L. Since V(C')  ≠  V(G'), we have [formula]. Therefore G  -  C has a triangle. Moreover, every vertex v in G  -  C belongs to a unique triangle Δv, and therefore as in [formula], G  -  C has a Λ-factor Q whose every component induces a triangle in G  -  C. Then [formula] is a required a Λ-factor in G. [formula] Obviously, [\ref=2con] [\ref=cubic] [\ref=tr] (a) also follows from [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=deg3cntrL-].

Theorem [\ref=2con] [\ref=cubic] [\ref=tr] is not true for a cubic 2-connected claw-free graph F with an edge xy belonging to two triangles Ti with V(Ti)  =  {x,y,zi}, i∈{1,2}, because L  =  z1xz2 is a 3-vertex path in F and y is an isolated vertex in F  -  L. Now we can give polynomial-time characterization of pairs (G,E) such that G is a 2-connected Δ-graph, E  ⊂  E(G), |E|  =  3, and G  -  E has no Λ-factor. Recall that if E  ⊆  E(G), then [formula] denotes the subgraph of G induced by E.

Proof     (uses [\ref=eb<3], [\ref=A], and [\ref=2con] [\ref=cubic] [\ref=tr](a)). Let E  =  {a,b,c}, where c  =  c1c2. [formula] We prove (e)  ⇒  (g).

Suppose that [formula] satisfies (e1), i.e. [formula] is a claw. Then G  -  E has an isolated vertex and therefore has no Λ-factor.

Suppose that [formula] satisfies (e2), i.e. [formula] is a triangle. Then by [\ref=A], G  -  E has no Λ-factor.

Now we assume (as in (e3) and (e4)) that [formula] has exactly two components [formula] and [formula], the 2-edge component [formula] belongs to a triangle T in G, E2  =  {a,b}, and E1  =  {c}, t  =  t1t2 is an edge in G  -  E, where t1 is an isolated vertex in T  -  E2, and so t1 is a (unique) leaf in G  -  E. Let u be the edge in T distinct from a and b.

Suppose that [formula] satisfies (e3), and so [formula] belongs to no triangle in G and G  -  E is not connected. Obviously, G  -  E has exactly two components. Let S the component in G  -  E containing edge t. Then edge u is not in S. Therefore every vertex in S distinct from the leaf t1 belongs to exactly one triangle. Hence [formula] implying that G  -  E has no Λ-factor.

Finally, suppose that [formula] satisfies (e4), and so edge c  =  c1c2 belongs to a triangle D in G, G  -  {d,t} is not connected, and E1, E2 belong to different components of G  -  {d,t}, where d is the edge in G  -  E(D) incident to the single vertex in D  -  {c1,c2}. Suppose, on the contrary, that G  -  E has a Λ-factor P. Since G is 2-connected and claw-free, G  -  {d,t} has exactly two components. Therefore G  -  {a,b}  -  (E(D)  -  c) has also two components. Let C' be the component of G  -  {a,b}  -  (E(D)  -  c) containing c. Since G is a Δ-graph, G  =  FΔ for some cubic 2-connected graph F (with possible parallel edges). Let d' and t' be the edges in F corresponding to edges d and t of G, respectively. Since F is 2-connected, F  -  {d',t'} has at most two components. Since G  -  {d,t} is not connected, F  -  {d',t'} has exactly two components. It follows that H  =  G  -  {a,b}  -  E(D))  =  G  -  E  -  E(D) has also exactly two components. Therefore C  =  C'  -  c is connected, and so C is a component of H containing the end-vertices c1 and c2 of edge c.

Let Cu and Ct be the components of H containing u and t, respectively. Then Cu  ≠  Ct. Now [formula] is the component in G  -  {d,t} containing E2. By (e4), [formula]. Therefore c is an edge of [formula]. Thus Ct  =  C. Clearly, C has exactly three leaves c1, c2, and t1 (the leaf incident to t) and every other vertex of C belongs to a unique triangle in C, and so [formula]. By [\ref=A], C has no Λ-factor. Therefore P has a 3-vertex path L which contains at least one edge in D  -  c. Since t is a dangling edge in G  -  E, clearly P also has a 3-vertex path Lt containing t and Lt  ⊂  C. Therefore P has to contain a Λ-factor of C  -  L  -  Lt. However, [formula], a contradiction. [formula] Finally, we prove (g)  ⇒  (e). Namely, we assume that [formula] does not satisfy (e) and we want to show that in this case G  -  E has a Λ-factor.

Let X,Y  ⊂  E(G) be such that X meets no triangle in G, each edge in Y belongs to a triangle in G, and no triangle in G has more than one edge from Y, and so [formula]. We will use the following simple observation. Claim. G  -  X  -  Y has a Λ-factor P such that every component of P induces a triangle in G and if an edge y from Y is in a triangle T, then T  -  y is a component of P. By the above Claim, we can assume that the two edges of E2 belong to the same triangle T.

Suppose that [formula] is connected. Since [formula] does not satisfy (e), [formula] is not a claw and not a triangle. Then [formula] is a 3-edge path and [formula]. Let V be a 3-vertex path in G containing u and avoiding E. Then G  -  V has no edges from E, and so G  -  V  =  G  -  E - V. By [\ref=2con] [\ref=cubic] [\ref=tr](a), G  -  V has a Λ-factor.

Finally, suppose that [formula] is not connected, and so [formula] has exactly two components [formula] and [formula]. As in [formula], let E2  =  {a,b} and E1  =  {c}, and let u be the edge of T distinct from a and b. [formula] Suppose that c belongs to no triangle in G. Since [formula] does not satisfy (e) (namely, (e3)), G  -  E is connected. Clearly, G  -  E is claw-free. Also G  -  E has exactly two end-blocks and the block of one edge t is one of them. By [\ref=eb<3], G  -  E has a Λ-factor. [formula] Finally, suppose that c belongs to a triangle D in G. Then D  ≠  T. Since [formula] does not satisfy (e) (namely, (e4)), [formula] and [formula] belong to the same component of G  -  {d,t}. Let V(D)  =  {c1,c2,d1} and as above c  =  c1c2. Let d  =  d1d2 and t  =  t1t2, where t1∈V(T), and so t1 is an isolated vertex in T  -  {a,b}.

Let G'  =  G  -  {c,d}. Then G' and G'  -  E2 are claw-free and [formula] for every block B in G'. Obviously, G'  -  E2  =  G  -  E  -  d. Since G is 2-connected, G  -  c is also 2-connected. Therefore eb(G')  ≤  2 and if eb(G')  =  2, then the end-vertices d1 and d2 of edge d belong to different end-blocks B1 and B2 of G', respectively. If eb(G')  =  1, then G' is 2-connected. Therefore G'  -  E2 has at most two end-blocks. By [\ref=eb<3], G'  -  E2  =  G  -  E  -  d has a Λ-factor P, which is also a Λ-factor of G  -  E. So we assume that eb(G')  =  2. Since E1 and E2 belong to the same component of G  -  {d,t}, clearly d1, and E2 belong to the same component of G'  -  t.

Suppose that t is a cut-edge of G'. Then G'  -  t has exactly two components C1 and C2 containing {d1,t1} and d2, respectively, and each [formula]. Let L be a 3-vertex path c1d1d2 in G  -  c. Then C'1  =  C1  -  {c1,d1,t1} and [formula] are the two components of G  -  E  -  L containing d1 and d2, respectively. Also each, [formula] and C'i is claw-free and has exactly two end-blocks. By [\ref=2conclfr] and [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks], C'i has a Λ-factor Pi, i∈{1,2}. Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of G  -  E.

Finally, suppose that t is not a cut-edge of G'. Then {a,b,t} belongs to a 2-connected block R of G'. Then R  -  E2 has at most two end-blocks. By [\ref=2conclfr] and [\ref=Conclfr2endbplocks], R  -  E2 has a Λ-factor Q. Let B denote the set of all 2-connected blocks of G' distinct from R. Since [formula] for every B∈B, each B in B has a Λ-factor P(B). Then [formula] is a Λ-factor of G', which is also a Λ-factor of G  -  E. [formula] From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid(a] [\ref=b] [\ref=c)] we have, in particular:

From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid(a] [\ref=b] [\ref=c)] we also have:

It turns out that condition " G is claw-free" in [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid(a] [\ref=b] [\ref=c)] and in [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con-avoid(a] [\ref=b] [\ref=c)] is essential. Namely, we have a construction showing that for every 3-edge graph Y with no isolated vertices there are infinitely many pairs (G,E) such that G is a cubic 3-connected graph, [formula], E  ⊂  E(G), the subgraph [formula] induced by E in G is isomorphic to Y (and so |E|  =  3), and G  -  E has no Λ-factor.

Proof     (uses [\ref=eb<3]). Let x∈V(G). Since [formula], clearly [formula]. Since G is 2-connected, G  -  x is connected. Since G is claw-free, G  -  x is claw-free and has at most two end-blocks. By [\ref=eb<3], G  -  x has a Λ-factor. [formula] If on step (s1) of Procedure E we find a longest cycle in G containing a given vertex x, then this modification of Procedure E can also be used to prove [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con] [\ref=x-]. Moreover, the following strengthening of [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con] [\ref=x-] holds for 3-connected claw-free graphs.

Proof     (uses [\ref=2conclfr] and [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e]). Since G is 3-connected, G  -  x is a 2-connected claw-free graph. Since [formula], we have [formula]. By [\ref=2conclfr], G  -  x has a Λ-factor P. If [formula], then P is a Λ-factor of G  -  {x,e}. If e∈E(G  -  x), then by [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e], G  -  {x,e} has a Λ-factor. [formula]

Packings and domination in graphs

Recall that X  ⊆  V(G) is called a domination set in graph G, if every vertex in [formula] is adjacent to a vertex in X and that the domination number γ(G) is the size of a minimum domination set in G. We call a subgraph P in G a star-packing if every component of P is isomorphic to K1,s for some integer s  ≥  0.

Obviously, X is a domination set in G if and only if there exists a star-factor P  =  P(X) such that Cmp(P)  =  {Px:x∈X}, where x∈V(Px) and x is a (unique) vertex of degree at least two if v(Px)  ≥  3, and so |Cmp(P)|  =  |X|. Thus X is a minimum domination set in G if and only if P(X) is a star-factor in G having the minimum number of components and γ(G)  =  cmp(P(X)).

It is easy to show that every connected graph G with no isolated vertices has a star-factor with no isolated vertices, and so γ(G)  ≤  v(G) / 2.

Clearly, every Λ-packing P is a star-packing in G and P can be extended to a star-factor P' in G. Then γ(G)  ≤  cmp(P'). For that reason, results on the maximum Λ-packings in graphs may be useful in the study of some graph domination problems. Here is an example of such correlation.

In [\cite=R] B. Reed conjectured that if G is a connected cubic graph, then γ(G)  ≤  ⌈v(G) / 3⌉. It turns out that Reed's conjecture is not true for connected and even for 2-connected cubic graphs [\cite=Kcntrex] [\cite=KS]. Obviously, (d1) if a graph G has a Λ-factor (and so [formula]), then γ(G)  ≤  v(G) / 3, (d2) if [formula] and G  -  x has a Λ-factor for some vertex x of G, then γ(G)  ≤  ⌈v(G) / 3⌉, and (d3) if [formula] and G  -  {x,y} has a Λ-factor for some edge xy of G, then again γ(G)  ≤  ⌈v(G) / 3⌉. Now if claim (P) in Problem [\ref=Pr3con] is true, then from [\ref=cubic3-conZTF] and [\ref=cubic3-conT] it follows, in particular, that (d1), (d2), and (d3) above are true, and so Reed's conjecture is true for 3-connected cubic graphs. The following packing result is also related with Reed's domination conjecture.

It follows that if G is a cubic Hamiltonian graph with [formula], then γ(G)  ≤  ⌊v(G) / 3⌋ which is stronger than Reed's conjecture suggests. The following natural question arises:

In [\cite=Kcntrex] we gave a construction providing infinitely many cubic cyclically 4-connected graphs G with v(G)∈{0,2} mod 3 for which γ(G)  =  ⌈v(G) / 3⌉, and so Reed's suggested bound is tight even in the class of cyclically 4-connected graphs. From this construction it also follows that the claim similar to [\ref=Ham] for graphs G with [formula] is not true, namely, the graphs provided by the construction have no {Λ,Y}-factor.

No bipartite counterexamples to Reed's conjecture have been found. We can show that if claim (P) in Problem [\ref=Pr3con] is true for bipartite graphs, then Reed's conjecture is also true for bipartite 3-connected cubic graphs. Let γi(G) denote the size of a minimum independent domination set, and so γi(G)  ≥  γ(G). It is easy to see that if G is a claw-free graph, then γi(G)  =  γ(G). From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] and [\ref=G-Y] we have the following upper bounds on the domination number of claw-free graphs:

Further related results and questions

Given a family F of non-isomorphic graphs, an edge disjoint F-packing Q of G is a set [formula] such that each Qi  ⊆  E(G), every two members of Q are disjoint, and the subgraph [formula] induced by Qi in G is isomorphic to a member of F. Let [formula] and k(Q)  =  k. An edge disjoint F-packing Q in G is called an edge disjoint F-factor of G if E(P)  =  E(G). The edge disjoint F-packing problem is the problem of finding in G an edge F-packing Q having the maximum number of edges |E(Q)|. If F consists of one graph F, then an edge disjoint F-packing and an edge disjoint F-factor are called simply an edge disjoint F-packing and an edge disjoint F-factor, respectively. Accordingly, the edge disjoint F-packing problem is the problem of finding in G an edge disjoint F-packing Q having the maximum number of edges |E(Q)| or, equivalently, the maximum number of parts k(Q). Let λe(G) denote the number k(Q) of parts in a maximum edge disjoint Λ-packing of G.

A graph D is called the line graph of a simple graph G if V(D)  =  E(G) and ab∈E(D) if and only if edges a and b in G have a common end-vertex. Let L(G) denote the line graph of a graph G. A graph G is called a line graph if there exists a graph F such that G  =  L(F). It is known (and easy to show) that if two non-isomorphic graphs A and B are such that L(A) and L(B) are isomorphic, then {A,B}  =  {Y,Δ}, where Y is a claw and Δ is a triangle and both L(A) and L(B) are triangles. Therefore if [formula] and H is a line graph, then there is a unique graph F such that H  =  L(F). A packing P in a graph G is called an induced packing in G if P is an induced subgraph of G. We need the following simple observations. Let F a family of non-isomorphic graphs and L(F)  =  {L(F):F∈F}.

These observations allow to deduce various byproducts from the packing results described before and obtain some facts on edge disjoint packings in a graph. Here are some of these results. From [\ref=inducedpacking] we have, in particular:

Since the Λ-packing problem is NP-hard even for cubic graphs, we have:

Using a procedure for connected graphs similar to Procedure E' for 2-connected graphs, it is easy to show the following:

Since L(G) is a claw-free graph, we have from [\ref=EdgePackingLineGraph] and [\ref=MatchingInClawfreeGraphs]:

An edge disjoint factor Q of G is said to be an edge k-factor if every member of Q induces in G a connected graph having k edges.

Proof (uses [\ref=eb<3] and [\ref=EdgePackingLineGraph]). Since V(L(G))  =  E(G), we have: [formula]. Since L(G) is claw-free, by [\ref=eb<3], L(G) has a Λ-factor. Therefore we are done by [\ref=EdgePackingLineGraph]. [formula] We call a graph G an edge-chain if [formula], where each Bi is an edge 2-connected graph, all Bi' are disjoint, and each ei is an edge with one end-vertex in Bi and the other end-vertex in Bi + 1. It is easy to see the following.

From [\ref=clfree] [\ref=2con-avoid-e] (a1), [\ref=clfree] [\ref=3con] [\ref=einL], [\ref=edge3packing], and [\ref=edge-chain] we have:

In [\cite=KKN] we put forward the following conjecture.

By [\ref=inducedpacking], Conjecture [\ref=3conclawfreePi] is equivalent to the following conjecture on induced Λ-packings.

As we mentioned in the introduction, the problem of packing induced 3-vertex paths in a claw-free graph, interesting in itself, is also related to the Hadwiger conjecture.

Let h(G) be the maximum integer r such that G has Kr as a minor. In 1943 Hadwiger conjectured that if a graph G has no proper vertex coloring with s - 1 colors, then h(G)  ≥  s (see [\cite=D]). Now consider a graph F with α(F)  =  2, where α(F) in the size of a maximum vertex subset in F with no two adjacent vertices, and so F is claw-free. Then obviously the vertices of F cannot be colored properly with s - 1 colors, where s  =  ⌈v(G) / 2⌉. Thus, a natural (open) question is whether h(F)  ≥  s as the Hadwiger conjecture claims. If P is a Λ-packing in F such that every component (3-vertex path) of P is an induced subgraph in F, then every two components of P are connected by an edge in G. Therefore contracting each component L of P to a new vertex c(L) results in a graph G' having the complete subgraph K with V(K)  =  {c(L):L∈Cmp(P)}, and so v(K)  =  λ(P). Thus, the maximum packing of induced 3-vertex paths in F provides a maximum complete minor K of F in which every vertex corresponds to an induced 3-vertex path in F.

Let h'(F) be the maximum integer r such that F has a minor Kr in which every vertex corresponds to either a vertex or an edge in F. Obviously, h(F)  ≥  h'(F). In 1999 [\cite=K-Hadw] we proved that if F is not s-connected, then the Hadwiger conjecture is true, moreover, h'(F)  ≥  s. From [\ref=EdgePackingLineGraph] we have in particular:

It is known [\cite=DT] that the maximum edge disjoint Π-packing problem is NP-hard. Therefore by [\ref=inducedLpack], the maximum packing of induced 3-vertex paths is also NP-hard. However, probably the following is true.
