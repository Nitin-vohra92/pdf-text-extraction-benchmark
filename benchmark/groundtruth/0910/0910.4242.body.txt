Supernova SN 2008ax was discovered independently by Mostardi et al. (2008) and Itagaki (Nakano and Itagaki, 2008) on March 3.45 UT and March 4.62 UT, respectively. The magnitude of SN at discovery, estimated on unfiltered CCD frames, was about 16. The first detection was only 6 hours after the image with limiting magnitude about 18.5 and showing no sign of the SN was obtained by Arbour (2008). The offsets from the nucleus of the host galaxy NGC 4490 are 53[formula].1E, 25[formula].8S. The projected distance from the center is 2.8 kpc, while the radius of the galaxy is about 9 kpc. NGC 4490 is a barred spiral galaxy of type SBcd. SN II-P 1982F was discovered earlier in this galaxy (Tsvetkov, 1984). The positions of two SNe are quite close, SN 1982F occurred 19[formula] (0.9 kpc) closer to the nucleus at about the same positional angle (116deg  for SN 2008ax, 120deg  for SN 1982F).

Crockett et al. (2008) identified a source coincident with the position of SN 2008ax in pre-explosion HST observations in three optical filters. The possible progenitor may be a single massive star (initial mass [formula]), which loses most of its H-rich envelope and explodes as an 11-12 M[formula] helium-rich Wolf-Rayet star, or an interacting binary producing a stripped progenitor.

Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2008ax covering first 2 months past discovery were reported by Pastorello et al. (2008) (hereafter P08). The object displayed typical spectral and photometric evolution of a type IIb supernova, consistent with the explosion of a young Wolf-Rayet star.

Roming et al. (2009) (hereafter R09) presented UV, optical, X-ray and radio properties of SN 2008ax. They detected initial fading in UV light curves followed by a rise, reminiscent to the dip seen in type IIb SN 1993J.

We started photometric monitoring of SN 2008ax 4 days after the discovery and continued observations until 2009 January 23. CCD images in UBVRI filters were obtained with the following instruments: the 50-cm reflector of Astronomical Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences at Tatranska Lomnica with SBIG ST-10XME CCD camera (hereafter S50); the 50-cm meniscus telescope and the 60-cm reflector of Crimean Observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute equipped respectively with Meade Pictor 416XT and Apogee AP-47 cameras (C50, C60); the 70-cm reflector of Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow with Apogee AP-7 CCD camera (M70); the 1-m reflector of Simeiz Observatory with AP-47 camera (C100). The images on 2009 January 23 were obtained at the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North (F200).

The standard image reductions and photometry were made using IRAF.

The galaxy background around SN 2008ax is strong and non-uniform, and we applied image subtraction for most of the frames. Our observations did not allow to construct good template frames, and we used for subtraction the images of NGC 4490 downloaded from the ING archive.

After subtraction, the magnitudes of the SN were derived by PSF-fitting relative to a sequence of local standard stars. The comparison stars are shown on Fig. 1, and their magnitudes are reported in Table 1.

Stars 1-4 were measured photoelectrically in the B,V filters by Tsvetkov (1984), the comparison with the new CCD data reveals good agreement, the mean differences are ΔB  =   - 0.02;ΔV  =  0.04 mag. We may conclude that both calibrations are sufficiently correct.

The results of observations of the SN are presented in Table 2.

The light curves of SN 2008ax are shown in Fig. 2. The premaximum rise and the peak have good coverage by observations, and we can determine the dates and magnitudes of maximum light in different bands: Umax = 14.06;tUmax  =  JD2454546.9;Bmax = 14.09;tBmax  =  JD2454548.2;Vmax = 13.40;tVmax  =  JD2454550.3;Rmax = 13.06;tRmax  =  JD2454552.4;Imax = 12.73;tImax  =  JD2454552.5. The dates of maximum in UBVRI bands are in good agreement with the results by P08 and R09, while for the peak magnitudes the agreement is slightly worse. The maximum magnitudes from R09 in b,v bands are about 0.2 mag fainter than our data, but their u peak magnitude is practically equal to our estimate. The peak BV magnitudes derived by P08 are slightly fainter than our data.

After the maximum the brightness of SN declined very fast. At the phase 15 days past maximum the B magnitude declined by 1.67 mag. The fast drop continued for about 25 days, and at about JD 2454580 the onset of the linear decline is observed. The rates of decline in the period JD 2454580-680 are (in mag/day): 0.022 in V, 0.021 in R, 0.020 in I. After JD 2454680 the rate slightly decreased, the values for the period JD 2454680-850 are: 0.018 in V, 0.016 in R, 0.017 in I. In the B band the decline rate is constant for the period JD 2454580-850 and equals 0.016.

Fig. 3 presents the comparison of our data with the results by P08 and R09. The photometry by P08 in Sloan u',r',i' filters is transformed to U,R,I bands by the relations derived by Chonis and Gaskell (2008). The agreement between our magnitudes and the data from P08 is quite good, some differences are observed near maximum in the U,R,I bands. They may result from errors of transformation from Sloan to Johnson-Cousins photometric systems. The b,v magnitudes from R09 are significantly fainter than our results, while their u magnitudes agree well with our U data. We also plot in Fig. 3 the V-band light curves of SN IIb 1993J and SN Ic 2002ap (Richmond et al, 1996; Foley et al., 2003), aligned to match the peaks of the curves. The shape of the light curve of SN 2002ap is different from that of SN 2008ax: the rise to the maximum is faster, and the decline is slower. The second peak on the light curve of SN 1993J matches closely the light curve of SN 2008ax.

The absolute V-magnitude light curves of SN 2008ax and several SNe of types IIb, Ib and Ic are compared in Fig. 4. For SN 2008ax we adopted distance modulus μ  =  29.92 and extinction E(B - V) = 0.3 as in P08. The light curves of other SNe are taken from Richmond et al. (1996), Qiu et al. (1999), Stritzinger et al. (2002), Foley et al. (2003). With absolute peak V magnitude of - 17.45 mag SN 2008ax appears to be quite typical among SNe of similar classes. It is little fainter than SN IIb 1993J and SN Ib 1999ex, have nearly the same luminosity as SN Ic 2002ap and is significantly brighter than SN IIb 1996cb.

The color curves are shown in Fig. 5. The evolution of colors B - V and V - R is similar. Before maximum SN 2008ax becomes bluer, then quickly redden, and finally the colors remain nearly constant. U - B color probably evolves in the same way, but our data spans only the period of fast reddening. The R - I color curve is different, the color before maximum is nearly constant, and then only a slight reddening is observed.

We compute the light curves in UBVRI bands using our code STELLA, which incorporates implicit hydrodynamics coupled to a time-dependent multi-group non-equilibrium radiative transfer (Blinnikov et al., 1998). The specific model employed here was Model 13C of Woosley et al. (1994). This model was derived from a 13 M[formula] main sequence star that lost most of its hydrogen envelope to a nearby companion. The main parameters of the model are: total mass 3.8 M[formula], radius 600 R[formula], mass of 56Ni 0.11 M[formula], explosion energy 1.5  ×  1051 erg. The chemical composition is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 gives the resulting light curves, and Fig. 8 presents the light curves for the first 50 days past explosion.

The model light curves give a very good fit to the observed maximum, concerning both the luminosity and the shape. The differences are on the rising branch, where the computed early-time peak is brighter than observed, and on the tail, especially for the U and B bands. We consider the agreement to be quite satisfactory, but we continue the search for models which will give better fits. The results and more detailed discussion of the properties of the models and their impact on the possible evolution of the progenitor will be published in a subsequent paper.
