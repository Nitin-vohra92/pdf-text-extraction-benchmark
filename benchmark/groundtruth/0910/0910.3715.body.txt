TRANSCENDENCE MEASURES FOR SOME Um-NUMBERS RELATED TO LIOUVILLE CONSTANT

Introduction

A real number ξ is called a Liouville number, if for any positive real number w there exist infinitely many rational numbers p / q, with q  ≥  1, such that

[formula].

Transcendental number theory began in 1844 when Liouville [\cite=lio] showed that all Liouville numbers are transcendental establishing thus the first examples of such numbers. For instance, the number

[formula],

which is known as Liouville's constant, is a Liouville number and therefore transcendental. In 1962, Erd[formula]s [\cite=erdos] proved that every nonzero real number can be written as the sum and the product of two Liouville numbers.

In 1932, Mahler [\cite=mah] splited the set of the transcendental numbers in three disjoint sets named S-, T- and U-numbers. Particularly, the U-numbers generalizes the concept of Liouville numbers. We denote by w*n(ξ) as the supremum of the real numbers w* for which there exist infinitely many real algebraic numbers α of degree n satisfying

0 < |ξ  -  α|  <  H(α)- w* - 1,

where H(α) (so-called the height of α) is the maximum of absolute value of coefficients of the minimal polynomial of α (over [formula]). The number ξ is said to be a U*m-number (according to LeVeque [\cite=le]) if w*m(ξ) =   ∞   and w*n(ξ) <   ∞   for 1  ≤  n < m (m is called the type of the U-number). We point out that we actually have defined a Koksma U*m-number instead of a Mahler Um-number. However, it is well-known that they are the same [\cite=bugeaud] and [\cite=al2]. We observe that the set of U1-numbers is precisely the set of Liouville numbers.

The existence of Um-numbers, for all m  ≥  1, was proved by LeVeque [\cite=le]. In 1993, Pollington [\cite=pol] showed that for any positive integer m, every real number can be expressed as a sum of two Um-numbers.

Since two algebraically dependent numbers must belong to the same Mahler's class [\cite=bugeaud], then αL and α + L are U-numbers, for any nonzero algebraic number α. But what are their types?

In this note, we use G[formula]tting's method [\cite=gut] for proving that the sum and the product of every m-degree algebraic number α by L is a Um-number. Moreover, we obtain an upper bound for [formula].

Let α be an algebraic number of degree m and let L be the Liouville's constant. Then αL and α + L are Um-numbers, with

[formula]

Auxiliary Results

Before the proof of the main result, we need two technical results. The first one follows as an easy consequence of the triangular inequality and binomial identities.

Given [formula] with degree m and [formula]. If [formula] and [formula], then

H(Q1)  ≤   max {|a|,|b|}mH(P);

H(Q2)  ≤  2m + 1 max {|a|,|b|}mH(P).

(i) If [formula], then [formula]. Supposing, without loss of generality, that |a|  ≥  |b|, we have |a|m|aj|  ≥  |a|m - j|aj||b|j for 0  ≤  j  ≤  m. Hence, we are done. For (ii), write [formula], where

[formula]

Therefore

[formula].

Since [formula], we finally have

|ci|  ≤  2m + 1 max {|a|,|b|}mH(P),

which completes our proof.

In addition to Lemma 1, we use the fact that algebraic numbers are not well aproximable by algebraic numbers.

Let α and β be two distinct nonzero algebraic numbers of degree n and m, respectively. Then we have

|α  -  β|  ≥  (n + 1)- m / 2(m + 1)- n / 2 max {2- n(n + 1)- (m - 1) / 2,2- m(m + 1)- (n - 1) / 2} ×  H(α)- mH(β)- n.

A sketch of the proof can be found in the Appendix A of [\cite=bugeaud].

Proof of the Theorem

For k  ≥  1, set

[formula], qk = 10k! and [formula].

We observe that H(αk - 1) < H(αk) = 10k! = H(αk - 1)k and

[formula]

Thus, setting γk  =  ααk, we obtain of ([\ref=lp])

[formula]

where c = 10|α| / 9. It follows by the Lemma [\ref=1] (i) that H(αk)m  ≥  H(α)- 1H(γk) and thus we conclude that

[formula]

Consequently, αβ is a U-number with type at most m (since γk has degree m).

Again, we use Lemma [\ref=1] (i) for obtaining

[formula]

Now, let γ be an n-degree real algebraic number, with n < m and H(γ)  ≥  H(γ1). Thus, one may ensure the existence of a sufficient large k such that

[formula]

So, by Lemma [\ref=2], it follows that

[formula]

where f(m,n) is a positive number which does not depend on k and γ. Therefore by ([\ref=key])

[formula]

By taking H(γ) large enough, the index k satisfies

[formula]

Thus, it follows from ([\ref=opo]), ([\ref=22]) and ([\ref=33]) that |γk  -  γ|  ≥  2|αL  -  γk|. Therefore, except for finitely many algebraic numbers γ of degree n strictly less than m, we have

[formula]

where we use the left-hand side of ([\ref=key]). It follows that w*n(αL)  ≤  2m2n + m - 1 which finishes our proof.

The case α + L follows the same outline, where we use Lemma [\ref=1] (ii) rather than (i).

The general case and further comments

Let β be a Liouville number. Since that a U-number keeps its type when multiplied by any nonzero rational number, we can consider 0 < β  <  1. Set

[formula].

By the assumption on β, we may suppose 1  ≤  pk  ≤  qk and then H(pk / qk) = qk, for all k. Note that Sβ is an infinite set.

As is customary, the symbols ≪  , ≫   mean that there is an implied constant in the inequalities ≤  , ≥  , respectively. In our process for proving the Theorem 1, the key step happens when holds an inequality like in ([\ref=key]). Thus it follows that

Let α be an m-degree algebraic number and let β be a Liouville number. If there exists a sequence (pk / qk)k  ≥  1∈Sβ such that qk  ≪  qk + 1  ≪  qk + 1k for all k  ≫  1, then the numbers αβ and α  +  β are Um-numbers and

[formula]

For any m  ≥  1, there exists an uncountable collection of Liouville numbers that are expressible as sum of two algebraically dependent Um-numbers.

Set [formula], where aj∈{1,2}. The result follows immediately of Theorem 2 and of writing [formula].

There exist several lower estimates for the distance between two distinct algebraic numbers, e.g., Liouville's inequality and Lemma [\ref=2]. A too-good-to-be-true Conjecture due to Schmidt [\cite=sch] states that

For any number field [formula] and any positive real number ε, we have

[formula],

for any distinct [formula], where [formula] is some constant depending only on [formula] and on ε.

We conclude by pointing that if the Schmidt's conjecture is true, then the sum and the product of any m-degree algebraic number α by any Liouville number β is a Um-number and the inequality ([\ref=in2]) can be considerable improved for

[formula].
