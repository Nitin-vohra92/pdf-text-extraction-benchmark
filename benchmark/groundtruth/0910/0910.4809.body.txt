Introduction

The notion of pure pointedness appears in the theory of aperiodic systems in two different forms: pure point dynamical spectrum and pure point diffraction spectrum. The objective of this paper is to show that these two widely used notions are equivalent under a type of statistical condition known as the existence of uniform cluster frequencies.

The basic objects of study here are Delone point sets of [formula]. The points of these sets are permitted to be multi-colored, the colors coming from a finite set of colors. We also assume that our point sets [formula] have the property of finite local complexity (FLC), which informally means that there are only finitely many translational classes of clusters of [formula] with any given size. Under these circumstances, the orbit of [formula] under translation gives rise, via completion in the standard Radin-Wolff type topology, to a compact space [formula]. With the obvious action of [formula], we obtain a dynamical system [formula].

The dynamical spectrum refers to the spectrum of this dynamical system, that is to say, the spectrum of the unitary operators Ux arising from the translational action on the space of L2-functions on [formula].

On the other hand, the diffraction spectrum (which is the idealized mathematical interpretation of the diffraction pattern of a physical experiment) is obtained by first assigning weights to the various colors of the multiset and then determining the autocorrelation, if it exists, of this weighted multiset. The Fourier transform of the autocorrelation is the diffraction measure whose pure pointedness is the question.

There is a well known argument of S. Dworkin ([\cite=Dwor], [\cite=Hof]) that shows how to deduce pure pointedness of the diffractive spectrum from pure pointedness of the dynamical system. Our main result (Theorem [\ref=thm-equiv]) shows that, under the additional assumption that [formula] has uniform cluster frequencies (or equivalently, that the dynamical system [formula] is uniquely ergodic), the process can be reversed, so in fact the two notions of pure pointedness are equivalent.

The present understanding of diffractive point sets is very limited. One of the important consequences of this result is that it allows the introduction of powerful spectral theorems in the study of such sets. Our forthcoming paper [\cite=LMS] on diffractive substitution systems makes extensive use of this connection.

In the last section we discuss what can be salvaged when there are no uniform cluster frequencies. Then the equivalence of pure point dynamical and pure point diffraction spectra still holds -- perhaps, not for the original Delone set [formula], but for almost every Delone set in [formula], with respect to an ergodic invariant measure.

The prototype of the dynamical system [formula] is a symbolic dynamical system, that is, the [formula]-action by shifts on a space of bi-infinite sequences. In the symbolic setting, the equivalence of pure point dynamical and diffraction spectra has been established by Queffelec [\cite=Queff], and our proof is largely a generalization of her argument.

When the dynamical spectrum is not pure point, its relation to the diffraction spectrum is not completely understood. It follows from [\cite=Dwor] that the latter is essentially a "part" of the former. So, for instance, if the dynamical spectrum is pure singular/absolutely continuous, then the diffraction spectrum is pure singular/absolutely continuous (apart from the trivial constant eigenfunction which corresponds to a delta function at 0). However, the other direction is more delicate: Van Enter and Mikisz [\cite=VEM] have pointed out that, in the case of mixed spectrum, the non-trivial pure point component may be "lost" when passing from dynamical spectrum to diffraction spectrum.

The presentation below contains a number of results that are essentially well-known, though not always quite in the form needed here. For the convenience of the reader we have attempted to make the paper largely self-contained.

Multisets, dynamical systems, and uniform cluster frequencies

A multiset or m-multiset in [formula] is a subset [formula]   (m copies) where [formula]. We also write [formula]. We say that  = (Λi)i  ≤  m is a Delone multiset in [formula] if each Λi is Delone and [formula] is Delone.

Although [formula] is a product of sets, it is convenient to think of it as a set with types or colors, i being the color of points in Λi. A cluster of [formula] is, by definition, a family   =  (Pi)i  ≤  m where Pi  ⊂  Λi is finite for all i  ≤  m. Many of the clusters that we consider have the form [formula], for a bounded set [formula]. There is a natural translation [formula]-action on the set of Delone multisets and their clusters in [formula]. The translate of a cluster [formula] by [formula] is x  +    =  (x  +  Pi)i  ≤  m. We say that two clusters [formula] and ' are translationally equivalent if  = x + ' for some [formula].

We write BR(y) for the closed ball of radius R centered at y and use also BR for BR(0).

In this paper we will usually assume that our Delone multisets have FLC.

Let [formula] be a Delone multiset and X be the collection of all Delone multisets each of whose clusters is a translate of a [formula]-cluster. We introduce a metric on Delone multisets in a simple variation of the standard way : for Delone multisets 1, 2∈X,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us indicate why this is a metric. Clearly, the only issue is the triangle inequality. Suppose that d(1,2)  ≤  ε1, d(2,3)  ≤  ε2; we want to show that d(1,3)  ≤  ε1  +  ε2. We can assume that ε1,ε2  <  2- 1 / 2, otherwise the claim is obvious. Then

[formula]

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Since B1 / ε1( - x2')  ⊃  B(1 / ε1) - ε2(0), this implies

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

A simple computation shows that [formula] and [formula] when ε1,ε2  <  2- 1 / 2, so by ([\ref=metric1]) and ([\ref=metric2]),

[formula]

hence d(1,3)  ≤  ε1  +  ε2.

We define [formula] with the metric d. In spite of the special role played by 0 in the definition of d, any other point of [formula] may be used as a reference point, leading to an equivalent metric and more importantly the same topology on [formula]. The following lemma is standard.

If [formula] has FLC, then the metric space [formula] is compact.

The group [formula] acts on [formula] by translations which are obviously homeomorphisms, and we get a topological dynamical system [formula].

Let η()  >  0 be chosen so that every ball of radius [formula] contains at most one point of (), and let b() > 0 be such that every ball of radius [formula] contains at least a point in (). These exist by the Delone set property.

The following technical result will be quite useful.

Let [formula] be a Delone multiset with FLC. For any [formula] and 0  <  δ  <  η(), there exist Delone multisets [formula] and Borel sets Vj with (Vj)  <  δ, (∂Vj)  =  0, 1  ≤  j  ≤  N, such that

[formula]

is a disjoint union, where [formula].

Proof. For any [formula] consider the clusters [formula]. They are non-empty, by the definition of b(). By FLC, there are finitely many such clusters up to translations. This means that there exist [formula] such that for any [formula] there are unique n = n()  ≤  K and [formula] satisfying

[formula]

For [formula] let

[formula]

By construction, [formula], and this is a disjoint union.

Next we show that the sets Wj are sufficiently "nice," so that they can be obtained from a finite number of closed balls using operations of complementation, intersection, and union.

Let b = b() and fix j. Since every ball of radius b / 2 contains a point in (), we have that Wj  ⊂  Bb(0). Indeed, shifting a cluster of points in BR(0) by more than b would move at least one point out of BR(0). Let [formula]. The set Wj consists of vectors u such that - u  +  j is a BR(0)-cluster for some Delone multiset in [formula]. Thus u∈Wj if and only if the following two conditions are met. The first condition is that for each x∈(j), we have - u  +  x∈BR(0). The second condition is that no points of j outside of BR(0) move inside after the translation by - u. Since Wj  ⊂  Bb(0), only the points in BR + b(0) have a chance of moving into BR(0). Thus we need to consider the BR + b(0) extensions of j. By FLC, in the space [formula] there are finitely many BR + b(0)-clusters that extend the cluster j. Denote these clusters by [formula]. Summarizing this discussion we obtain

[formula]

This implies that Wj is a Borel set, with (∂Wj) = 0.

It remains to partition each Wj such that [formula], where (Vjk)  ≤  δ, 0  <  δ  <  η(). To this end, consider, for example, a decomposition of the cube d into a disjoint union of (half-open and closed) grid boxes of diameter less than δ  <  η(). Let Q denote the (finite) collection of all these grid boxes. Then

[formula]

where Vjk's are disjoint and (∂Vjk)  =  0. Note that the union [formula] is disjoint, from the definition of Wj and (Vjk)  <  η() for all k  ≤  nj. So the lemma is proved. [formula]

For a cluster [formula] and a bounded set [formula] denote

[formula]

where [formula] means the cardinality. In plain language, [formula] is the number of translates of [formula] contained in A, which is clearly finite.

For a bounded set [formula] and r  >  0, let

[formula]

A van Hove sequence for [formula] is a sequence F  =  {Fn}n  ≥  1 of bounded measurable subsets of [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Recall that a topological dynamical system is uniquely ergodic if there is a unique invariant probability measure.

Let [formula] be a Delone multiset with FLC and {Fn}n  ≥  1 be a van Hove sequence. The system [formula] is uniquely ergodic if and only if for all continuous functions [formula],

[formula]

uniformly in [formula], with the constant depending on f.

This is a standard fact (both directions, see e.g. [\cite=Wal], [\cite=DGS], or [\cite=Queff] for the case of [formula]-actions); we include a (well-known) elementary proof of the needed direction for the reader's convenience.

Proof of sufficiency in Theorem [\ref=thm-erg1]. For any invariant measure μ, exchanging the order of integration yields

[formula]

so by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the constant in ([\ref=eq-erg1]) is [formula]. If there is another invariant measure ν, then [formula] for all [formula], hence μ  =  ν. [formula]

Now we prove that FLC and UCF imply unique ergodicity of the system [formula]. This is also a standard fact, see e.g. [\cite=Queff] for the case of [formula]-actions.

Let [formula] be a Delone multiset with FLC. Then the dynamical system [formula] is uniquely ergodic if and only if [formula] has UCF.

Proof. Let X,V be a cylinder set with (V)  ≤   η() and f be the characteristic function of X,V. Then we have by the definition of the cylinder set:

[formula]

where xν are all the vectors such that xν  +    ⊂  . It is clear that the distance between any two vectors xν is at least η(), so the sets xν + V are disjoint. Let

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

So

[formula]

If [formula] is uniquely ergodic,

[formula]

for continuous functions f' approximating the characteristic function f of the cylinder set. Thus for any cluster [formula],

[formula]

i.e. [formula] has UCF.

On the other hand, we assume that [formula] has UCF. By Lemma [\ref=lem-tech], [formula] can be approximated in the supremum norm by linear combinations of characteristic functions of cylinder sets X,V. Thus, it is enough to check ([\ref=eq-erg1]) for f the characteristic function of X,V with (V) < η(). We can see in the above ([\ref=uni-ucf]) that ([\ref=eq-erg1]) holds for all - h +  uniformly in [formula] under the assumption that [formula] has UCF. Then we can approximate the orbit of [formula] on Fn by - hn  +   as close as we want, since the orbit [formula] is dense in [formula] by the definition of [formula]. So we compute all those integrals ([\ref=eq-erg1]) of - hn  +   over Fn and use the fact that independent of hn they are going to a constant. Since each of these is uniformly close to (In)(,f) in ([\ref=eq-erg1]), we get that (In)(,f) too goes to a constant. Therefore [formula] is uniquely ergodic. [formula]

Denote by μ the unique invariant probability measure on [formula]. As already mentioned, the constant in ([\ref=eq-erg1]) must be [formula]. Thus, the proof of unique ergodicity yields the following result.

Let [formula] be a Delone multiset with FLC and UCF. Then for any [formula]-cluster [formula] and any Borel set V with (V)  <  η(), we have

[formula]

Pure-pointedness and Diffraction

Dynamical spectrum and diffraction spectrum

Suppose that   =  (Λi)i  ≤  m is a Delone multiset with FLC and UCF. There are two notions of pure pointedness that appear in this context. Although they are defined very differently, they are in fact equivalent. Given a translation-bounded measure ν on [formula], let γ(ν) denote its autocorrelation (assuming it is unique), that is, the vague limit

[formula]

where {Fn}n  ≥  1 is a van Hove sequence . In particular, for the Delone multiset [formula] we see that the autocorrelation is unique for any measure of the form

[formula]

Indeed, a simple computation shows

[formula]

Here (y,z) stands for a cluster consisting of two points y∈Λi,z∈Λj. The measure γ(ν) is positive definite, so by Bochner's Theorem the Fourier transform [formula] is a positive measure on [formula], called the diffraction measure for ν. We say that the measure ν has pure point diffraction spectrum if [formula] is a pure point or discrete measure .

On the other hand, we also have the measure-preserving system [formula] associated with [formula]. Consider the associated group of unitary operators [formula] on [formula]:

[formula]

Every [formula] defines a function on [formula] by x  ↦  (Uxf,f). This function is positive definite on [formula], so its Fourier transform is a positive measure σf on [formula] called the spectral measure corresponding to f. We say that the Delone multiset [formula] has pure point dynamical spectrum if σf is pure point for every [formula]. We recall that [formula] is an eigenfunction for the [formula]-action if for some [formula],

[formula]

where ·   is the standard inner product on [formula].

σf is pure point for every [formula] if and only if the eigenfunctions for the [formula]-action span a dense subspace of [formula].

This is a straightforward consequence of the Spectral Theorem, see e.g. Theorem 7.27 and § 7.6 in [\cite=Weidmann] for the case d = 1. The Spectral Theorem for unitary representations of arbitrary locally compact Abelian groups, including [formula], is discussed in [\cite=Mackey].

An equivalence theorem for pure pointedness

In this section we prove the following theorem.

Suppose that a Delone multiset [formula] has FLC and UCF. Then the following are equivalent:

[formula] has pure point dynamical spectrum;

The measure [formula] has pure point diffraction spectrum, for any choice of complex numbers (ai)i  ≤  m;

The measures δΛi have pure point diffraction spectrum, for i  ≤  m.

The theorem is proved after a sequence of auxiliary lemmas. Fix complex numbers (ai)i  ≤  m and let [formula]. For [formula] let

[formula]

so that [formula]. To relate the autocorrelation of ν to spectral measures we need to do some "smoothing." Let [formula] (that is, ω is continuous and has compact support). Denote

[formula]

and let

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. We have

[formula]

The continuity of [formula] follows from the continuity of ω and the definition of topology on [formula]. [formula]

Denote by [formula] the autocorrelation of [formula]. Since under our assumptions there is a unique autocorrelation measure γ  =  γ(ν), see ([\ref=eq-auto1]) and ([\ref=eq-auto2]), we have

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. We provide a proof for completeness, following [\cite=Hof]. By definition,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

where {Fn}n  ≥  1 is a van Hove sequence. Here the third equality is the main step; it follows from unique ergodicity and the continuity of [formula], see Theorem [\ref=thm-erg1]. Thus,

[formula]

and the proof is finished. [formula]

The introduction of the function fω and the series of equations ([\ref=Dwor-argu]) is often called Dworkin's argument.

Fix ε with [formula]. Consider all the clusters of diameter ≤  1 / ε in [formula]. There are finitely many such clusters up to translation, by FLC. Thus, there exists 0  <  θ1  =  θ1(ε) < 1 such that if ,' are two such clusters, then

[formula]

Here

[formula]

where

[formula]

with  = (Pi)i  ≤  m and '  =  (P'i)i  ≤  m .

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Denote by [formula] the cluster consisting of a single point of type i at the origin; formally,

[formula]

Let [formula] be the characteristic function for the cylinder set [formula].

Let [formula] be a bounded set with (V)  <  θ, where θ is defined by ([\ref=def-theta]), and 0  <  ζ  <  θ / 2. Let [formula] be such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Proof. We have by the definition of [formula] and Definition [\ref=def-cyl]:

[formula]

On the other hand, since ω is supported in V and there is at most one point of Λi' in V,

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

as desired. [formula]

Let [formula] with [formula], and (V)  <  θ, where θ is defined by ([\ref=def-theta]). We have

[formula]

Proof. We just have to prove that

[formula]

A Delone multiset [formula] is in the left-hand side whenever - v +   ⊂   for some v∈V. A Delone multiset [formula] is in the right-hand side whenever for each i  ≤  m and each x∈Pi there is a vector [formula] such that [formula], where [formula] stands for a single element cluster. Thus, "⊂  " is trivial. The inclusion "⊃  " follows from the fact that (V)  <  θ, see ([\ref=def-theta]) and ([\ref=eq-trans]). [formula]

Denote by Hpp the closed linear span in [formula] of the eigenfunctions for the dynamical system [formula]. The following lemma is certainly standard, but since we do not know a ready reference, a short proof is provided.

If φ and ψ are both in [formula], then their product φψ is in [formula] as well.

Proof. Fix arbitrary ε > 0. Since φ∈Hpp, we can find a finite linear combination of eigenfunctions [formula] such that

[formula]

Since the dynamical system is ergodic, the eigenfunctions have constant modulus, hence [formula]. Thus, we can find another finite linear combination of eigenfunctions [formula] such that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

It remains to note that [formula] since the product of eigenfunctions for a dynamical system is an eigenfunction. Since ε is arbitrarily small, φψ∈Hpp, and the lemma is proved. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-equiv]. (i) ⇒   (ii) This is essentially proved by Dworkin in [\cite=Dwor], see also [\cite=Hof] and [\cite=BM]. By Lemma [\ref=lem-spectr], pure point dynamical spectrum implies that [formula] is pure point for any [formula]. Note that

[formula]

Choosing a sequence [formula] converging to the delta measure δ0 in the vague topology, we can conclude that [formula] is pure point as well, as desired. (This approximation step requires some care; it is explained in detail in [\cite=BM].)

(ii) ⇒   (iii) obvious.

(iii) ⇒   (i) This is relatively new, although it is largely a generalization of Queffelec [\cite=Queff].

We are given that δΛi has pure point diffraction spectrum, that is, : =  is pure point, for all i  ≤  m. In view of ([\ref=eq-auto3]) and Lemma [\ref=lem-spectr], we obtain that σfi,ω is pure point for all i  ≤  m and all [formula]. So fi,ω∈Hpp for all i  ≤  m and all [formula]. Fix ε  >  0 and let V be a bounded set with (V)  <  θ  =  θ(ε), where θ is defined by ([\ref=def-theta]), and (∂V)  =  0. Find [formula] as in Lemma [\ref=lem-vspom]. Since ((∂V)+  ζ)  →  (∂V)  =  0 in Lemma [\ref=lem-vspom], as ζ  →  0, we obtain that [formula]. Therefore, also [formula]. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lem-prod] and Lemma [\ref=lem-prod2] that [formula] where [formula] for any [formula], (V)  <  θ, and (∂V)  =  0.

Our goal is to show that [formula]. Since [formula] is a regular measure space, [formula] is dense in [formula]. Thus, it is enough to show that all continuous functions on [formula] belong to Hpp. Fix [formula]. Using the decomposition [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem-tech] we can approximate f by linear combinations of characteristic functions of cylinder sets Xj,Vj. So it suffices to show that these characteristic functions are in Hpp, which was proved above. This concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-equiv]. [formula]

Concluding remarks: what if the UCF fails?

Here we present a version of the main theorem for Delone sets which do not necessarily have uniform cluster frequencies. For this we must assume that in addition to the van Hove property ([\ref=Hove]) our averaging sequence {Fn} is a sequence of compact neighbourhoods of 0 with the following properties:

[formula]

Let [formula] be a Delone set with FLC. Consider the topological dynamical system [formula] and an ergodic invariant Borel probability measure μ (such measures always exist). The ergodic measure μ will be fixed throughout the section.

Suppose that a Delone multiset [formula] has FLC. Then the following are equivalent:

The measure-preserving dynamical system [formula] has pure point spectrum;

For μ-a.e. [formula], the measure [formula] has pure point diffraction spectrum, for any choice of complex numbers (ai)i  ≤  m;

For μ-a.e. [formula], the measures δΓi have pure point diffraction spectrum, for i  ≤  m.

In fact, this formulation is closer to the work of Dworkin [\cite=Dwor] who did not assume unique ergodicity. The proof is similar to that of Theorem [\ref=thm-equiv], except that we have to use the Pointwise Ergodic Theorem instead of the uniform convergence of averages in the uniquely ergodic case ([\ref=eq-erg1]).

(Pointwise Ergodic Theorem for [formula]-actions (see, e.g. [\cite=Cha])) For any [formula],

[formula]

for μ-a.e. [formula].

For a cluster   ⊂  , a bounded set [formula], and a Delone set [formula], denote

[formula]

For μ-a.e. [formula] and for any cluster   ⊂  ,

[formula]

exists for μ-a.e. [formula]. Moreover, if (V)  <  η(), then the cylinder set X,V satisfies, for μ-a.e. [formula]:

[formula]

Note that we no longer can claim uniformity of the convergence with respect to translation of [formula].

Sketch of the proof. Fix a cluster   ⊂   and let X,V be a cylinder set, with (V)  <  η(). Applying ([\ref=th-pet]) to the characteristic function of X,V and arguing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-unerg] (with - h  +   replaced by [formula]), we obtain ([\ref=N1]) and ([\ref=N2]) for μ-a.e. [formula]. Since there are countably many clusters   ⊂  , we can find a set of full μ-measure on which ([\ref=N1]) and ([\ref=N2]) hold for all [formula]. [formula]

For a Delone set  = (Γi)i  ≤  m, let [formula]. Then, for μ-a.e. [formula], the autocorrelation γ(ν) exists as the vague limit of measures [formula], and

[formula]

for μ-a.e. [formula], which is the analogue of ([\ref=eq-autocorr]). Again, [formula] is a positive measure, called the diffraction measure, giving the meaning to the words "pure point diffraction spectrum" in Theorem [\ref=th-noucf].

Sketch of the proof of Theorem [\ref=th-noucf]. For μ-a.e. [formula], the Pointwise Ergodic Theorem [\ref=thm-pet] holds for all functions [formula] (since the space of continuous functions on [formula] is separable).

The ν',ρω,', and [formula] are defined the same way as in Section 3. Lemma [\ref=lem-cont] applies to our situation. Next we can show that

[formula]

for μ-a.e. [formula]. This is proved by the same chain of equalities as in ([\ref=Dwor-argu]), except that we average over Fn defined in ([\ref=add-van_Hove]) and use Theorem [\ref=thm-pet] instead of Theorem [\ref=thm-unerg]. Lemma [\ref=lem-vspom] goes through, after we replace [formula] by [formula], for μ-a.e. [formula]. There are no changes in Lemmas [\ref=lem-prod] and [\ref=lem-prod2], since we did not use UCF or unique ergodicity in them. The proof of Theorem [\ref=th-noucf] now follows the scheme of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-equiv]. We only need to replace [formula] by μ-a.e.  [formula], for which hold all the "typical" properties discussed above. [formula]
