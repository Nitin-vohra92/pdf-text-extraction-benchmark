On the influence of resonance photon scattering on atom interference

Introduction

With the rise and advancement of neutron [\cite=ref1] and atom interferometry [\cite=ref2] [\cite=ref3], it has become feasible the realization of the well-known gedanken experiments devised by Einstein during his famous discussions with Bohr [\cite=ref4], later also considered by Feynman [\cite=ref5]. These discussions were focused on the understanding and interpretation of the wave-particle duality and, therefore, the completeness of Quantum Mechanics. In particular, Bohr [\cite=ref4] and Feynman [\cite=ref5] argued that wave and particle properties were complementary, i.e. they could not be simultaneously observed experimentally. On the other hand, aimed to disprove the concept of complementarity, Einstein devised double-slit type experiments [\cite=ref4] where it should be possible to obtain "which-way" information without influencing the interference pattern. Einstein's viewpoint based on the compatibility of the wave and particle properties, i.e. that both are present simultaneously and, therefore, can be observed in quantum interference experiments, was supported by De Broglie [\cite=ref6] and Bohm [\cite=ref7]. For these authors, the quantum system comprises both a wave and a particle, the former guiding the motion (evolution) of the latter, which leads to a hydrodynamic-like view of Quantum Mechanics [\cite=ref8] [\cite=ref9].

More recently, Rauch and Vigier have pointed out [\cite=ref10] that de Broglie's and Bohm's arguments were based on the so-called einweg experiments, which should explicitly show that individual particles go along one trajectory, but without evidencing which particular trajectory. Of course, the "which-way" argument implies the einweg one, but not vice versa. The difference between these two types of argument arises from the different signatures of wave and particle properties invoked in them. More specifically, for Bohr and Feynman the particle signature is the "which-way" information, while the wave signature is the visibility or relative contrast of the interference pattern. On the contrary, for de Broglie [\cite=ref6], Bohm [\cite=ref7], Philippidis et al [\cite=ref11] or Sanz et al [\cite=ref12] [\cite=ref13] [\cite=ref14], the particle signature is the arrival of individual quantum particles to a screen (array of detectors) and the time evolution of the distribution of these arrivals [\cite=ref15]; the wave signature associated with each quantum particle is the visibility of the interference pattern together with the fact that it comes from the accumulation of arrivals of a large number (theoretically, an infinite number) of atoms, photons, electrons, etc.

To perform experimentally Feynman's gedanken experiment, Chapman et al [\cite=ref16] scattered single photons from Na atoms within a three-grating Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer. By measuring the transmission of atoms through the third grating, the influence of photon scattering processes (which take place at a distance y'12 from the first grating) on the visibility of the atom interference pattern was investigated. These results have intensified a controversial discussion on the wave-particle duality issue. At the time when the experiment was carried out, this controversy evolved towards a discussion around the question: Is complementarity more fundamental than the uncertainty principle? [\cite=ref17] [\cite=ref18] [\cite=ref19] [\cite=ref20] This discussion continued [\cite=ref21] [\cite=ref22] [\cite=ref23] [\cite=ref24] [\cite=ref25] with the aim to determine the cause of the visibility decrease: Does the visibility decrease arise (a) from a random momentum transfer between the atom and the photon or (b) from the correlations between the "which-way" detector and the atomic motion? More recently, the statement (b) has been reformulated as [\cite=ref3]: Is the visibility decrease (decoherence) the result of entanglement between a quantum system (the atom) and an environment (the emitted photon, which carries information about the atom's path).

Previously, we explained [\cite=ref26] the experiment carried out by Chapman et al using the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for an atom interacting with a photon and the gratings in a three-grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In our explanation, wave and particle properties were compatible, since in our opinion both are present and play a role. We derived an analytic expression for the visibility dependence on the ratio dp  /  λi  =  y'12(2π / kdλi), where k is the wave number of the atomic center-of-mass motion, d is the grating constant and λi is the photon wavelength. This theoretical result was in fairly good agreement with the visibility measured in the experiment [\cite=ref16]. The distribution of transferred momentum during the photon scattering process leads to the visibility decrease as dp  /  λi approaches 0.5 as well as several subsequent revivals with decreasing maxima. Here, we provide additional arguments which support our conclusions of reference [\cite=ref26]. In particular, we study the visibility dependence on the features of the atom selection at the exit of the interferometer, before the detection takes place. We also show that in the experiment the photon-atom interaction takes place within the Fresnel region, i.e. the near field region, associated with the first grating, something that has to be taken into account within any dynamical (i.e. time-dependent) description of the experiment.

Wave function of an atom after interacting with a grating and a photon

Consider an initial stationary atomic monochromatic wave, which spreads along the y-axis and is incident to a one-dimensional grating parallel to the x-axis at y = 0,

[formula]

with Bi being a constant. After interacting with the grating (i.e. after getting diffracted), this incident wave transforms into

[formula]

where

[formula]

satisfies the Helmholtz equation [\cite=ref27]. If the grating is completely transparent inside the slits (the union of slit areas is denoted by A) and completely absorbing outside them, c(kx) can be expressed [\cite=ref27] as

[formula]

where ψi(x',0-) and ψ(x',0+) denote the wave function just before and just after the first grating, respectively. The solution of the Helmholtz equation, ψ(x,y), given by ([\ref=eq3]), is equivalent to the Fresnel-Kirchhoff solution

[formula]

The photon-atom scattering event induced by the laser light at a distance y'12 from the first grating leads to a change of the atomic transverse momentum, Δkx, and, therefore, to a shift of the wave function in the momentum representation. Hence, after an atom absorbs and re-emits again a photon somewhere along the x axis at a time t'12 and a distance y'12  =  vt'12  =  (t'12 from the first grating, the atomic wave function takes the form [\cite=ref26]

[formula]

where

[formula]

The wave function ([\ref=eq6]), evaluated at the distance y12, which separates the second from the first grating, was used [\cite=ref26] as a wave incident onto the second grating. Then, the wave function propagating towards the third grating was determined using ([\ref=eq5]), where ψ(x',0+) consists of the parts of the incident wave which are transmitted through the slits of the second grating.

This is the way how the evolution of the initial plane wave ([\ref=eq1]) was determined. After interacting with the first grating, a photon at the distance y'12 from this slit, and a second grating, the resulting wave function evolves freely again up to the third grating. In order to illustrate this evolution, in figure [\ref=fig1] we have plotted the atom probability density within the interferometer at several distances from the first grating. Two values for the transferred momentum are considered: Δkx = 0 (blue) and Δkx = 1.5ki (red). Far from a grating, the straight lines represent the paths along which the maxima of the probability density move; near the grating, these straight lines would just be the prolongation of the paths. Note that in the near field associated with a grating, the wave function has a very complex form and the lines do not exactly represent the paths of the atoms. Within this region, according to a Bohmian picture [\cite=ref13] [\cite=ref14], there are many paths which, as the distance from a grating increases, converge towards three main paths (only two are plotted in figure [\ref=fig1]). The extension of the near field is of the order of 10LT, where Lt  =  2d2  /  λ is the so-called Talbot distance [\cite=ref14].

Dependence of visibility on the distribution of transferred momentum

In the experiment [\cite=ref16], the number of Na atoms transmitted through the third grating is counted for the laser off and laser on varying the distance y'12 as well as considering different values of the shift Δx3 of the third grating along the x-axis. In a first round of measurements, all transmitted atoms were collected (counted) without carrying out any selection. Thus, the resulting interference curve can be directly associated with the distribution of transferred momentum, which is given by the Mandel-Wolf expression [\cite=ref28] [\cite=ref29]

[formula]

Then, in subsequent measurements, specific subsets of transmitted atoms were counted after being selected using certain slits positioned after the third grating. As explained in [\cite=ref16], each selection is equivalent to a particular distribution of transferred momentum during the photon-atom scattering process. The experimental data show that the interference pattern visibility strongly depends on the ratio dp  /  λi as well as on the probability distribution for the transferred momentum, P(Δkx).

In order to explain and interpret these experimental data within our approach [\cite=ref26], it is necessary to study the function

[formula]

where

[formula]

The latter function is proportional to the number of atoms transmitted through the third grating that undergone a change of momentum Δkx during the photon-atom scattering process behind the first grating. By numerical integration, it was shown [\cite=ref26] that ([\ref=eq10]) has the general form

[formula]

where a and b are constants, and

[formula]

For y'12 far from a grating, dp denotes the separation between two paths associated with the zeroth and first order interference maxima; near the grating, it refers to the distance between the prolongations of these paths. Based on these results, we may assume that for certain classes of distribution functions P(Δkx), T(y'12,Δx3) has the general form

[formula]

where the visibility V and phase-shift φ are both functions of the ratio dp  /  λi, and their particular form is determined by P(Δkx), which is assumed to be normalized on the interval

[formula]

Conclusions

To explain atom interference experiments with presence of photon-atom scattering processes, in our opinion it is necessary to use the atom wave function as well as to take into account its particle properties (i.e. the change of momentum during photon-atom scattering events). The experimentally established visibility dependence on dp  /  λi was previously explained [\cite=ref26] by considering a random change of the atomic transverse momentum induced by the scattering with photons.

The experimental regain of visibility induced by selecting a subset of atoms from the set of all those transmitted through the third grating is explained by studying the visibility dependence on the probability distribution of transferred momenta. This atom selection does not provide any information about the place along the x-axis where the photon scatters from the atom. Consequently, it is not necessary to attribute the decrease and disappearance of visibility as dp  /  λi increases to an increase of an observer's (potential) knowledge about the atomic path behind the first grating.

From our description, we also find that photon-atom scattering processes happen within the Fresnel region, where the atomic wave function has a very complex form (see figure [\ref=fig1]). But, as has been shown within the context of the Talbot effect [\cite=ref14], the topology of the trajectories also becomes very complex within this region. Therefore, not two but many atomic paths exist near the grating, where the photon hits the atom. As one moves further away from the grating (towards the Fraunhofer region), those numerous trajectories basically group along three main paths. Here, we have considered two of them for a chosen value of the transferred momentum to explain the experiment.

The agreement between our theoretical expressions for the visibility and the experimental curves thus supports, in our opinion, the views of Einstein, de Broglie, Bohm and others, i.e. that individual micro-objects can be simultaneously described by a wave and a particle. In particular, here we have stressed that such an agreement has been obtained by using both the space and momentum atom distributions as quantum objects. In this way, our results also agree with and support the more general conclusions due to Ballentine [\cite=Ballentine] and Khrennikov [\cite=Khrennikov1] [\cite=Khrennikov2]. According to these authors, the question of complementarity versus compatibility of wave and particle properties is tightly connected to the problem of the existence of a joint distribution of two dynamical variables associated with two non-commutative operators, as well as to the question of whether simultaneous measurements of two non-commutative operators is possible. In our theoretical approach, we have not considered a joint distribution of coordinates and momenta, but we used both distributions to explain the experimental results.

To recapitulate, our results show that different outcomes of the experiment should not be associated with the presence of an external observer, but with the sensitivity of the experiment which is being carried out or, in other words, the particular measurement performed. More specifically, with our analysis we have shown here that the visibility depends on the experiment itself and can be nicely explained taking into account all the elements present in such an experiment.

The importance of context, i.e. the concrete specification of the experimental setup in the analysis of interference phenomena is reconsidered by Ballentine [\cite=Ballentine] and Khrennikov [\cite=Khrennikov1] [\cite=Khrennikov2] from a general point of view. According to the latter author, the main structures of the Quantum Theory are already present in a latent form within the classical Kolmogorov probability model. In this regard, a very interesting question arises, namely to compare our findings and method with such an approach. At present, this idea is being considered as a direction for future research.
