Introduction

The problem

Suppose that M is a manifold and that G / H is a homogeneous space. A G / H-structure on M is a maximal choice of coordinates on M valued in G / H, with transition maps given by action of elements of G. A G / H-structure is also called a locally homogeneous structure modelled on G / H.

There is a great deal known about G / H-structures on compact complex surfaces, as long as H is compact; see Wall [\cite=Wall:1985] [\cite=Wall:1986]. We will suppose instead that G / H is a complex homogeneous space (i.e. that G is a complex Lie group and H  ⊂  G is a closed complex Lie subgroup), and that the G / H-structure is holomorphic (i.e. the coordinates valued in G / H are all holomorphic maps). A homogeneous space G / H is primitive if G does not preserve a foliation on G / H. A locally homogeneous structure is called primitive if its model is. The primitive holomorphic locally homogeneous structures on compact complex surfaces are classified; see Klingler [\cite=Klingler:1998]. The imprimitive are a mystery, although the foliations are roughly classified; see Brunella [\cite=Brunella:1997]. This paper will classify explicitly a particular family of imprimitive holomorphic locally homogeneous structures (the [formula]-structures) on a particular family of compact complex surfaces (the primary Hopf surfaces). The technique consists largely of elementary power series calculations using Weierstrass polynomials in different coordinate charts. Along the way we develop a systematic machinery for computations on Hopf surfaces. Our aim in this paper is to develop the tools needed to eventually classify all holomorphic locally homogeneous structures on all compact complex surfaces. Although the arguments of this paper are disappointingly complicated, the results are simple and surprising. The authors believe that uncovering these results is an essential step in the large and important programme of understanding geometry of locally homogeneous structures on low dimensional manifolds.

Organization of this paper

Before we can study geometric structures on Hopf surfaces, we will need to review the known results on cohomology of line bundles on Hopf surfaces, and also classify the flat [formula]-bundles on Hopf surfaces. We complete this in sections [\ref=sec:Survey] and [\ref=sec:VectorBundles].

In section [\ref=sec:GeometricStructures], we define the concept of locally homogeneous geometric structure, and we explain the simplifications to the general theory that occur on Hopf surfaces.

The geometric structures in this paper are modelled on the total space [formula] of the usual holomorphic line bundle [formula]. We write [formula] as G / H for suitable groups G and H. We explain how [formula]-structures can be encoded as ordinary differential equations in section [\ref=sec:GeometricStructures]. The group G acting on [formula] is complicated, and we need to unravel its conjugacy classes in some detail in section [\ref=section:TheModel].

In section [\ref=section:Examples], we write out explicit expressions in coordinates for each of the [formula]-structures on each Hopf surface. Unfortunately for our study, certain Hopf surfaces (known as hyperresonant Hopf surfaces) have large and complicated families of [formula]-structures, depending on arbitrarily large families of parameters, which are responsible for the length and complexity of this paper. The hyperresonant structures are the only surprise in this paper, having no apparent geometric description. Section [\ref=section:Classification] proves that the various [formula]-structures that we have explicitly written out are the only ones that any Hopf surface can bear. Section [\ref=section:Inducement] presents some preliminary results on locally homogeneous geometric structures inducing these [formula]-structures.

Definition and survey of Hopf surfaces

The Poincaré domain

Suppose that [formula] is a biholomorphism fixing the origin. Suppose moreover that all eigenvalues λ of F'(0) satisfy |λ| < 1; F is said to lie in the Poincaré domain. By the Poincaré-Dulac theorem (see [\cite=Arnold:1988] p. 192), F is conjugate by a biholomorphism of [formula] to a map of precisely one of the two forms In the first case, F is called diagonal. In the second case, F is called exceptional and m is an integer which we will call the degree of F. We will not quite follow [\cite=Mall:1998] in describing a diagonal map as:

In this article (breaking from tradition) we will consider homotheties to be special cases of hyperresonant maps, rather than requiring that a hyperresonant map have m1,m2  ≥  2. If a map F is hyperresonant, then we will refer to the pair m1,m2 of integers for which λm11  =  λm22 and for which m1 (and hence m2) has the smallest possible positive value, as the hyperresonance of F.

Hopf surfaces

A Hopf surface is a compact complex surface covered by [formula]. For example, for any F in the Poincaré domain, let SF be the quotient [formula]. Hopf surfaces of the form SF are called primary. Every Hopf surface admits a finite covering by a primary Hopf surface (see [\cite=Kodaira:1966] p. 696). From now on, when we refer to a Hopf surface, we will always assume that it is primary. Two Hopf surfaces are biholomorphic just when the associated biholomorphisms of [formula] are conjugate by a biholomorphism. Any term used to describe the map F will also be used to describe SF; for example a Hopf surface is called linear or diagonal or resonant, etc. if the map F is.

An example: if [formula], then clearly SF is diffeomorphic to S3  ×  S1. Every Hopf surface can be smoothly deformed into this one, through a family of Hopf surfaces, so all Hopf surfaces are diffeomorphic to S3  ×  S1.

Biholomorphism groups of Hopf surfaces

The biholomorphism groups of Hopf surfaces are well known [\cite=Namba:1974] [\cite=Wehler:1982]:

with a  ≠  0 and b arbitrary complex constants.

Meromorphic functions

A Weierstrass polynomial [formula] is a polynomial in z1, with coefficients holomorphic functions of z2, so that there is some point of the complex line z1 = 0 at which [formula].

Suppose that [formula] is an open neighborhood of the origin, and that f is a meromorphic function on [formula]. Then there is an open neighborhood [formula] of the origin, with U'  ⊂  U, an integer k, relatively prime Weierstrass polynomials W1 and W2 on U', and a function h holomorphic on U', so that

[formula]

in [formula]. The neighborhood U' is not uniquely determined, but once U' is chosen then the rest is uniquely determined, i.e. any two such representations must agree on U'.

By Levi's theorem (see [\cite=Taylor:1939]) any meromorphic function on [formula] extends uniquely to a meromorphic function U. We can then find a possibly smaller neighborhood U' of 0 on which f = h1 / h2 is a ratio of holomorphic functions. Write out Weierstrass polynomial factorizations of h1 and h2; these exist by the Weierstrass preparation theorem [\cite=Hormander:1990] p. 157. The functions involved are all uniquely determined by uniqueness of Weierstrass polynomial factorization of holomorphic functions.

The meromorphic functions on Hopf surfaces are well known [\cite=Mall:1998]:

An simpler but incorrect proof of this lemma has been given in the literature; [\cite=Kodaira:1966] p. 697 and [\cite=Barth/Peters/VanDenVen:1984] p. 226. For F exceptional or generic, the arguments work perfectly well, and yield the indicated meromorphic sections. For F hyperresonant, it turns out that we will need a little more work, as will be clarified below. These authors each claim that if f is a meromorphic function on a Hopf surface, then zN1f is holomorphic on [formula], for large enough N, which is not true for

[formula]

even though this function f is meromorphic on the Hopf surface S1 / 2.

Suppose that f is a meromorphic function on a Hopf surface SF. Treat f as an F-invariant meromorphic function on [formula]. By lemma , near the origin [formula], with W1 and W2 uniquely determined Weierstrass polynomials in z1, and h nowhere vanishing and holomorphic. Under action of F, these Weierstrass polynomials get transformed into new Weierstrass polynomials in z1, up to scaling. By uniqueness of Weierstrass polynomials for the numerator and denominator of f, F must just scale each Weierstrass polynomial. But then h must also only get rescaled. Hence h,W1 and W2 are themselves sections of various line bundles on the Hopf surface. The value of [formula] at the origin is the same nonzero value as that of [formula] at the origin. So h must scale by 1, i.e. h must in fact be a holomorphic function on the Hopf surface, and so h is a constant. So f = cW1 / W2 is rational in z1. Swapping the roles of z1 and z2 in this argument, f must also be rational in z2, so a rational function.

Expanding out W1 and W2 in Taylor series, the terms zk11zk22 in their Taylor series must all scale in the same way: by a factor of λk11λk22. If there are no hyperresonances, then there can only be one such term, and it must be the same term in W1 and W2, so f is constant. If there is a hyperresonance, we can multiply numerator and denominator Weierstrass polynomials each by a factor of zk11zk22 for some integers k1 and k2 to arrange that they are both rational functions of u.

Bundles on Hopf surfaces

Meromorphic sections of line bundles

If g is any invertible matrix, say N  ×  N, then we can construct a vector bundle [formula] over each Hopf surface SF by the equivalence (z,v)  ~  (F(z),gv). Conjugate linear maps yield isomorphic vector bundles, and splitting g into Jordan blocks yields a sum of vector bundles, so let's assume that g is a single Jordan block. The invariant subspaces of g determine a flag of invariant vector subbundles on the Hopf surface. The meromorphic sections are the solutions of

[formula]

From the exponential sheaf sequence, every line bundle on every Hopf surface has the form [formula] for a unique nonzero complex number a (see [\cite=Barth/Peters/VanDenVen:1984] p. 226 or [\cite=Mall:1991]).

Take [formula] in the Poincaré domain, and a  ≠  0 a complex number. The meromorphic sections of the line bundle [formula] are, up to isomorphism (with c an arbitrary complex number, u = zm11 / zm22, and P(u) and Q(u) arbitrary polynomials):

[formula]

If F is hyperresonant with hyperresonance [formula], and a = λk11λk22, then draw a dot at [formula] and at every point given by shifting [formula] over by integer multiples of [formula]: In particular, the line through these points has negative slope. The Laurent series terms in each meromorphic section f of [formula] have exponents [formula] lying on these points, so each dot represents a meromorphic section, up to scaling. The holomorphic sections of the line bundle arise from the points in the nonnegative quadrant. The tensor product of line bundles is just addition of the points lying on the associated lines.

Take a meromorphic section, say f. Replacing f with zk11zk22f for various integers k1 and k2 gives a meromorphic section of the line bundle with a replaced by λk11λk22a. Moreover, f  ↦  zk11zk22f is an isomorphism of meromorphic sections of these line bundles. So we can arrange that f doesn't vanish or have poles at generic points of both axes. But then on each axis, f transforms like [formula]. Clearly f is meromorphic on both coordinate axes. Taking a Laurent expansion in some annulus around the origin, we find that [formula] for an appropriate choice of integer [formula], and [formula] for some integer [formula]. So once again replacing f by some [formula], we can arrange that f is a nonzero constant on the z1 axis, and that a = 1: f is a meromorphic function on the Hopf surface. Applying our classification of meromorphic functions from lemma , finally every meromorphic section of every line bundle [formula] has the form

[formula]

By cancelling common factors, we can arrange that P and Q have no common zeros and that neither P(u) nor Q(u) have zeros at u = 0.

Flat bundles of projective lines

We can similarly consider a bundle of projective spaces [formula], with [formula]. Such bundles are precisely the flat bundles with projective space fibers over Hopf surfaces. We can assume that g is in Jordan normal form. We will refer to any meromorphic map f on [formula] valued in [formula] satisfying f(F(z)) = g  f(z) as a meromorphic section of the bundle. For example, if g fixes infinity, we will also equally well allow f to be everywhere infinite rather than being meromorphic, and then also call such a map f a meromorphic section. Obviously the constant maps f valued in the locus of fixed points of g will provide meromorphic sections. We will only need to consider flat bundles of projective lines. We will write elements of [formula] as matrices in square brackets.

Suppose that [formula] belongs to the Poincaré domain and [formula]. The meromorphic sections of the flat projective line bundle [formula] are given in table  (after a suitable isomorphism to put F and g into one of the indicated forms). Every meromorphic section is a holomorphic section.

The proof is split up into several lemmas.

Take any diagonal linear map [formula], say

[formula]

in the Poincaré domain and any nondiagonalizable linear fractional transformation [formula]. Then a meromorphic section of [formula] is precisely a constant mapping to the fixed point of g on [formula].

We can assume that

[formula]

with a  ≠  0. Suppose that f is a meromorphic section, which we identify with a meromorphic function on [formula]. The poles of [formula] can't accumulate to 0, unless f is infinite at the generic point of z1 = 0. So either f =   ∞   on z1 = 0 or else we can take a Laurent series expansion of [formula] around z2 = 0. Plug in z1 = 0 to see that

[formula]

The Laurent expansion has inconsistent constant term, unless f is infinite on the line z1 = 0. The same argument swapping the roles of z1 and z2 ensures that f is infinite on the line z2 = 0. Therefore f must be infinite at all points of both coordinate axes. Suppose that f is not infinite everywhere. So we can write

[formula]

with [formula], where W is a Weierstrass polynomial (for one or the other of the axes) and h is holomorphic, and h and W have no common factors among holomorphic functions. We will pick [formula] and [formula] as large as possible to keep W holomorphic, so W will be finite and nonzero at the generic point of both axes. To be a meromorphic section, we need

[formula]

In terms of the Weierstrass polynomial,

[formula]

Clearly [formula] is a Weierstrass polynomial (up to a constant factor) for the denominator of the left hand side, while [formula] is a Weierstrass polynomial for the denominator of the right hand side. By the uniqueness of Weierstrass polynomials, W transforms by scaling, so as a holomorphic section of a holomorphic line bundle, i.e. [formula] for some integers k1 and k2. By remark [\ref=remark:lineOfResonances], because W is holomorphic, neither k1 nor k2 can be negative. Moreover, h must transform according to

[formula]

By proposition , W can be written as

[formula]

for some complex numbers [formula].

In order that W not vanish on either axis, we must have

[formula]

with b0  ≠  0 and bN  ≠  0. In particular, we can take [formula]. Expanding h into a Taylor series

[formula]

and plugging in [formula], we see that the term [formula] satisfies

[formula]

This forces b0 = 0, a contradiction. Therefore there are no meromorphic sections of such bundles except for f =   ∞  .

Take any diagonal linear map [formula], say

[formula]

in the Poincaré domain and any linear fractional transformation [formula]. If

[formula]

then the flat projective line bundle [formula] has meromorphic sections either the constant map [formula] or

[formula]

where

[formula]

and m1 and m2 are from the hyperresonance λm11  =  λm22. (We take P(u) / Q(u) constant if there is no hyperresonance.) If g is not conjugate in [formula] to a matrix of the required form above, then a meromorphic section is precisely a constant mapping to one of the fixed points of g on [formula].

If g is not diagonalizable, then the result is proven in lemma . So assume that g is diagonal, say

[formula]

and the contraction F is diagonal linear. Then a meromorphic section is a meromorphic function [formula] for which [formula]. Again, such a function f has the form

[formula]

and a1 / a2 must have the form λk11λk22 or else f is constant and equal to 0 or ∞  . Therefore

[formula]

up to rescaling, or else there are no meromorphic sections other than f = 0 and f =   ∞  .

Every meromorphic section of a flat projective line bundle on any Hopf surface is a holomorphic section.

In general, a meromorphic function f on a complex surface need not be a holomorphic map to [formula]. It will be a holomorphic map to [formula] just when, near each point, it can be made a holomorphic function by a linear fractional transformation. Equivalently, either f or 1 / f is a holomorphic function at each point. Equivalently, either f is finite, or 1 / f is finite near each point. Equivalently, the zero locus of f does not cross the poles of f. Every meromorphic section of any flat bundle of projective lines over a diagonal Hopf surface is holomorphic, as the zeroes and poles occur only along the curves z1 = 0, z2 = 0 and [formula].

Consider an exceptional map F in the Poincaré domain. We can assume that [formula]. Take a linear fractional transformation g fixing a single point of [formula]. We can assume that

[formula]

Then the meromorphic sections of the [formula]-bundle [formula] are precisely the functions

[formula]

for any constant b. All meromorphic sections are holomorphic.

Suppose that f is a meromorphic section, which we identify with a meromorphic function on [formula]. The poles of [formula] can't accumulate to 0, unless f is infinite at the generic point of z1 = 0. So either f =   ∞   on z1 = 0 or else we can take a Laurent series expansion of [formula] around z2 = 0. Plug in z1 = 0 to see that

[formula]

The Laurent expansion has inconsistent constant term, unless f is infinite on the line z1 = 0. We can therefore write

[formula]

for some [formula], with h(z) holomorphic and W(z) a Weierstrass polynomial in z1 not dividing into h(z). Then

[formula]

Clearly (up to scaling by a constant) W(z) is a Weierstrass polynomial for the denominator of [formula], as is W(F(z)), along the line z1 = 0. By uniqueness of Weierstrass polynomials, W(F(z)) = c  W(z) for some constant c. But then W must be a holomorphic section of a line bundle on the associated Hopf surface. By proposition , [formula] for some integer k  ≥  0. So we can assume that

[formula]

with [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

Again restrict to z1 = 0 to see that

[formula]

Expand h in a Taylor series to see that [formula] for some integer k  ≥  0 and [formula] So we see that

[formula]

Following Kodaira [\cite=Kodaira:1966] p. 697 equation 100, we let [formula]. Then we calculate that

[formula]

Therefore h1 is a holomorphic section of a line bundle, and by proposition ,

[formula]

so that

[formula]

for some complex numbers as, and we plug in to find

[formula]

Looking at the zkm1 coefficient yields c = λm / a. Plugging in s  ≠  km yields as = 0. Therefore

[formula]

Finally

[formula]

Geometric structures on Hopf surfaces

Geometric structures

If G / H is any homogeneous space, a G / H-structure is a maximal atlas of charts valued in G / H, with transition maps in G. The identity map of a homogeneous space G / H is contained in a unique G / H-structure, and is called the model G / H-structure. If G / H is affine (projective) space and G is the group of affine (projective) transformations, then G / H-structures are called affine (projective) structures. Clearly any linear Hopf surface SF bears an affine structure, since the transition map F is linear.

For example, let [formula] and H the subgroup fixing the point [formula]. So [formula]. Every linear Hopf surface has an obvious G / H-structure, since its universal covering space is G / H and its covering group acts by an element of G.

If [formula] and H is the stabilizer of a point of [formula], then a G / H-structure is called a projective connection.

Developing maps and holonomy

Every G / H-structure on any manifold M is obtained from a local diffeomorphism [formula] of the universal covering space of M (called the developing map), equivariant for a homomorphism [formula] (called the holonomy): to recover the G / H-structure, compose [formula] with a local inverse of   →  M to give an atlas of local coordinates valued in G / H.

The pair [formula] are only defined up to the G-action [formula]. Conversely, the G-orbit of this pair under this action determines the G / H-structure. Moreover, any choice of two maps [formula] and [formula] with [formula] a group morphism and [formula] a [formula]-equivariant local diffeomorphism determines a unique G / H-structure on M.

See Thurston [\cite=Thurston:1997] p. 140.

Therefore we will classify G / H-structures on Hopf surfaces by writing out their developing maps and holonomies.

If M is a complex manifold and G is a complex Lie group with H a closed complex subgroup, then a G / H-structure is called holomorphic if its developing map is holomorphic, or equivalently if all of the charts of the structure are holomorphic maps. From now on all locally homogeneous structures will be assumed holomorphic.

A structure is called complete if the developing map is onto.

A structure is called essential if the developing map is injective.

Essential structures are precisely the induced structures on manifolds covered by open sets of the model. For example, a Riemann surface of any genus has the obvious holomorphic projective connection given by the inclusion [formula].

On a Hopf surface SF, the fundamental group has the distinguished generator F, so the holonomy map [formula] is determined by the element [formula]; refer to this element as the holonomy generator of the G / H-structure.

A branched G / H-structure on a manifold M is a choice of map   →  G / H (again called the developing map), equivariant for a homomorphism π1(M)  →  G (again called the holonomy), determined up to the same G-action.

The developing map of a branched structure might not be a local biholomorphism. The basic difficulty we encounter in this paper is that of distinguishing branched from unbranched structures. Obstructions to structures are usually also obstructions to branched structures, so if there is a branched structure, then most of the obstructions we can come up with will not help us to rule out the possibility of an unbranched structure.

Induction of structures

Suppose that G0 / H0 and G / H are homogeneous spaces. A morphism of homogeneous spaces Φ:G0 / H0  →  G / H means a morphism Φ:G0  →  G of Lie groups so that [formula]. We will also denote the induced map G0 / H0  →  G / H by the letter Φ. A morphism of homogeneous spaces is called an avatar if the induced smooth map G0 / H0  →  G / H is a local diffeomorphism.

If Φ:G0 / H0  →  G / H is an avatar, and we have a G0 / H0-structure on a manifold M, with developing map [formula] and holonomy [formula], then the induced G / H-structure is the one given by [formula] and [formula].

The model

Definition

As usual, we treat points of [formula] as lines through 0 in [formula], and we write [formula] for the bundle over [formula] whose fiber over a point [formula] is the n-fold symmetric product [formula], if n > 0, and [formula] if n < 0, and [formula] if n = 0. We will denote the total space of the bundle [formula] also as [formula]. Clearly [formula] is a complex surface. For now, let's assume that n > 0 and write the points of [formula] as pairs (L,q) with [formula]. Thus the global sections of [formula] are the homogeneous polynomials of degree n, [formula]. Let

[formula]

act on [formula] by [formula]. The multiplication in G is [formula] and the inverse operation is [formula]. Let H be the stabilizer of [formula], where L0 is the line z2 = 0 in [formula]; i.e.

[formula]

Clearly [formula]. Moreover, G acts freely on [formula]. The action of G preserves the fiber bundle map [formula], and preserves the affine structure on each fiber. It also acts transitively on the global sections of [formula], a family of curves transverse to the fibers. Moreover it acts on [formula] via a surjection to the group of linear fractional transformations.

Every surface with [formula]-structure inherits a foliation, corresponding to the fiber bundle map, and inherits a family of curves which locally are identified with the global sections. Locally, on open sets on which the foliation is a fibration, the base space of the fibration is a Riemann surface with projective structure; in this sense the foliation has a transverse projective structure.

Ordinary differential equations and geometric structures

It is well known (see Lagrange [\cite=Lagrange:1957a] [\cite=Lagrange:1957b], Fels [\cite=Fels:1993] [\cite=Fels:1995], Dunajski and Tod [\cite=Dunajski/Tod:2006], Godliski and Nurowski [\cite=Godlinski/Nurowski:2007], Doubrov [\cite=Doubrov:2008]) that every (real or holomorphic) scalar ordinary differential equation of order n + 1  ≥  3 has a symmetry Lie algebra of point transformations of dimension at most n + 5, and this dimension is acheived just precisely for the ordinary differential equations which are locally identified by point transformation with the equation [formula]. Moreover, every holomorphic scalar ordinary differential equation locally point equivalent to [formula] is locally determined by, and locally determines, an [formula]-structure. Each solution of the differential equation is identified by the developing map with a global section of [formula].

Conjugacy classes in the symmetry group

Recall that

[formula]

In this section we show that every element (g,p)∈G is conjugate to one of a certain normal form defined in definition .

The conjugates of an element (g,p)∈G are the elements of the form

[formula]

Pick a matrix [formula]. There are no nonzero g-invariant homogeneous polynomials of degree n just when, for all homogeneous polynomials p of degree n, (g,p) is conjugate to (g,0).

We can take g0 = I, and then we have to solve p0g- 1  -  p0  =  p. The kernel of the map p0  ↦  p0g- 1  -  p0 is precisely the g invariant homogeneous polynomials of degree n. Therefore the linear map p0  ↦  p0g- 1  -  p0 is onto just when there are no g-invariant polynomials.

If [formula] lies in the Poincaré domain, or if g- 1 does, then, for any homogeneous polynomial p of any positive degree, (g,p) is conjugate to (g,0)

If g is not diagonalizable, then, for any homogeneous polynomial p of any positive degree, either (1) (g,p) is conjugate to (g,0) or (2) (g,p) is conjugate to

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

and that (g,p) is not conjugate to (g,0). By lemma , we can take a nonzero g-invariant polynomial p0 of degree n. Factor out as many factors of z2 from [formula] as possible, say

[formula]

Then q0 must scale under g-action by [formula]. Suppose that q0 has degree m. Write out coefficients

[formula]

The highest order term in z1 must be bnzm1  ≠  0, since otherwise we could factor out more factors of z2 from q0. Compute out

[formula]

In order that q0 scale by [formula], we must have

[formula]

Since bm  ≠  0, we must have am + k = 1, a root of unity. But then the second equation becomes mbm  =  0. Since bm  ≠  0, we must have m = 0, so q0 is constant and p0 = c  zn2.

Because p0 is g-invariant, we must have an = 1. Since (g,p)∈G has matrix part g defined only up to multiplication by n-th roots of 1, we can arrange a = 1. The polynomials that we can arrive at in the form p0  -  p0g- 1 are clearly precisely those of the form

[formula]

Looking at the leading terms in z1, we see that we can successively pick [formula] to kill off the [formula] terms in p by conjugation by [formula], until we kill off all terms except the zn1 term. Then we rescale by conjugation by [formula] to rescale p as needed to arrange p = zn1.

A matrix [formula] is called hyperresonant if it is diagonalizable with eigenvalues λ1,λ2 satisfying λm11  =  λm22 for some pair of integers [formula]. Such a pair of integers [formula] will be called a hyperresonance pair of g, and the collection of hyperresonance pairs (an abelian subgroup of [formula]) will be called the hyperresonance group Λg of g. If the hyperresonance group is of rank 1, we take the element [formula] with smallest positive m1 (or [formula] with smallest positive m2), and call it the hyperresonance of g.

The hyperresonance group of a diagonalizable matrix g with eigenvalues λ1,λ2 has rank 0 just when g is not hyperresonant, rank 2 just when λ1  =  e2πip1 / q1 and λ2  =  e2πip2 / q2 where [formula] and [formula] are rational numbers, and rank 1 otherwise.

Suppose that λ1  =  e2πip1 / q1 and λ2  =  e2πip2 / q2 where [formula] and [formula] are rational numbers. Clearly [formula] and [formula] lie in Λg, so Λg has rank 2.

Conversely, suppose that the rank of Λg is 2. Suppose that λm11  =  λm22 with [formula]. Let [formula]. Then m1r1  =  m2r2. So the hyperresonance group lies on a line through 0 in [formula], unless r1 = r2 = 0. If r1  ≠  0 or r2  ≠  0, then there is an integer point on that line with smallest nonzero distance from the origin, and Λg is of rank 1.

So we can suppose that r1 = r2 = 0, i.e. λ1  =  e2πia1 λ2  =  e2πia2 for some real numbers 0  ≤  a1,a2  <  1. The hyperresonance pairs are just the pairs of integers [formula] for which m1a1  +  m1a2 is an integer. The hyperresonance group spans [formula], since it doesn't lie on a line. Take two linearly independent hyperresonances [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

where b1,b2 are integers. Therefore

[formula]

are rational numbers, say aj = pj / qj with pj,qj integers, j = 1,2.

Suppose that (g,p)∈G and that g is diagonalizable. The resonant degrees of p are the integers k with 0  ≤  k  ≤  n for which the eigenvalues λ1,λ2 of g satisfy λk1λn - k2 = 1. If we write

[formula]

the resonant terms of p are the terms akZk1Zn - k2 for which k is a resonant degree. The leading resonant term is the term akzk1zn - k2 with smallest resonant degree k for which ak  ≠  0. The trailing resonant term is the term akzk1zn - k2 with largest resonant degree k for which ak  ≠  0.

Suppose that (g,p)∈G and that g is not diagonalizable. We will declare that n is a resonant degree of p if g has eigenvalue λ an n-th root of 1, and declare that there are no resonant terms otherwise. Once again, the resonant terms are the nonzero terms of resonant degree.

We will say that an element (g,p)∈G is in normal form if either

[formula]

and p = 0 or

[formula]

and [formula] or

[formula]

is diagonal and

[formula]

with all nonresonant terms vanishing, and ak = 1 for both the leading and trailing resonant terms.

Every element (g,p)∈G is conjugate to an element in normal form. Either (1) the normal form is unique up to possibly permuting coordinates z1 and z2 or (2) g = I and all terms of p are resonant.

Suppose that there are at least two distinct resonant terms. Then (1) g is diagonalizable with eigenvalues λ1 = e2πip1 / q1 and λ2 = e2πip2 / q2 with [formula] rational numbers and (2) for each resonant degree k,

[formula]

is an integer.

By lemma , we can assume that

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

Then pick any element [formula] of the form

[formula]

and say

[formula]

Define a polynomial p1 by

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

Therefore the coefficients of p1 are

[formula]

So we can conjugate (g,p) to arrange ak = 0 by choice of bk unless k is a resonance degree. So we can and will assume that p has only resonant terms. If there is exactly one resonant term, say degree k, then we can arrange by choice of the coefficients μ1 and μ2 that [formula].

If p has two or more resonant terms, then we can find two corresponding resonant degrees, say k1 and k2. The hyperresonant pairs [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent elements of the hyperresonance group, which must therefore have rank 2. By lemma , g has eigenvalues λ1 = e2πip1 / q1 and λ2 = e2πip2 / q2 with [formula] rational numbers, and

[formula]

is an integer for each resonant degree k.

Next we can pick μ1 and μ2 to arrange that the leading and trailing resonant coefficients are 1. So we have acheived normal form. If the eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 are not equal, then the only choices of g0 which will preserve the diagonalization of g are diagonal themselves, and we immediately see that there is a unique normal form up to swapping the coordinates Z1 and Z2.

If the normal form is not unique, then g = λI, for some constant [formula]. If λ is not an [formula] root of 1, then there are no g invariant homogeneous polynomials, so we can arrange after conjugation [formula], arriving at normal form. Suppose that λ is an [formula] root of 1. But (λI,p) = (I,p)∈G, since we mod out by [formula] roots of 1. So we can assume that λ = 1, i.e. g = I. Under conjugation, p is acted on by g0. The roots of p, with multiplicities, are transformed by linear fractional transformation. Since g0 can rescale p, the conjugacy classes of elements of G of the form (I,p) are precisely identified with choices of n unordered points on [formula], not necessarily distinct, modulo linear fractional transformations of [formula]. For more on these conjugacy classes, see Popov and Vinberg [\cite=Shafarevich:1994] p. 140 or Howard et. al. [\cite=Howard/Millson/Snowden/Vakil:2009].

We will say that an element (g,p)∈G is generic if it is conjugate to an element of the form (g',0) where

[formula]

is diagonal (with the same eigenvalues as g).

Generic elements form a dense open subset of G. An element (g,p) is not generic just when (1) g is not diagonalizable or (2) g is hyperresonant and p has at least one resonant degree.

Affine coordinates

We want to cover [formula] in coordinate charts, which we will refer to as affine coordinates on [formula]. Take a line L0 in [formula], which we will also think of as a point of [formula]. Consider the open subset of [formula] which lies over [formula]. This open subset of [formula] is preserved by all of the elements (g,p)∈G for which g fixes the line L0. Let's use linear coordinates Z1,Z2 on [formula]. Take L0 to be the line Z2 = 0. We will now produce coordinates t1,t2 on the corresponding open subset of [formula]. Map [formula] where L is the line Z1  =  t1Z2, and [formula]. Clearly t1 = Z1 / Z2 is an affine chart on [formula]. In these coordinates, if we let

[formula]

then the element (g,0)∈G acts by

[formula]

If [formula], then the element (I,p)∈G acts by

[formula]

We cover [formula] in two coordinate charts: [formula] and

[formula]

where

[formula]

The global sections [formula] of [formula], i.e. homogeneous polynomials of degree n, when written in these coordinates become [formula]. In particular, they satisfy

[formula]

Examples

Our examples are summarized in tables  and . We will now explain them in detail.

The radial structures on linear Hopf surfaces

We can map [formula] by [formula] for any integer k > 0. Similarly, we can map [formula] for all integer values of k: if k < 0 then take any element (L,q) with q  ≠  0 to the pair (L,r|k|) where r is dual to q in [formula]. These maps are local biholomorphisms away from the 0-sections. Moreover, these maps are equivariant under [formula]. In particular, [formula] maps by local biholomorphism to [formula] for every n  ≠  0. The [formula]-structures induced by this map on [formula] are invariant under linear isomorphisms of [formula]. Therefore they quotient to every linear Hopf surface. We will refer to these [formula]-structures as the radial [formula]-structures on Hopf surfaces. In affine coordinates, each radial structure has developing map

[formula]

defined where z2  ≠  0. Where z2 = 0, we can just swap indices of z1 and z2 to get another affine chart, so we can see that the structure is holomorphic. The image of the developing map is the complement of the 0-section in [formula], so the structure is incomplete. The developing map is an n-fold covering of its image, so is inessential. The holonomy generator is (g,p) = (F,0). More generally, swapping indices of z1 and z2 is an involution on the space of [formula]-structures on diagonal Hopf surfaces.

The eigenstructures on linear Hopf surfaces

A related example: consider [formula] foliated by vertical lines, i.e. the lines [formula]. The affine transformations of [formula] which preserve this foliation are precisely the maps of the form

[formula]

with [formula]. Let G1 be the group of all such affine transformations, and H1 the subgroup fixing the origin, i.e. with b1 = b2 = 0. Clearly the graph of any polynomial function [formula] of degree n is carried to the graph of another polynomial of the same degree by any element of G1. It follows (as we will shortly see) that there is an invariant [formula]-structure for which these graphs correspond to the global sections of [formula], and the vertical lines to the fibers.

Consider the subgroup G0  ⊂  G consisting of elements (g,p)∈G of the form

[formula]

Of course, g is defined as a matrix only up to scaling by n-th roots of 1. Consider the complex Lie group isomorphism

[formula]

given by

[formula]

This isomorphism identifies G1 with the subgroup G0  ⊂  G, and H1 with H0  ⊂  H. Therefore a G / H-structure is induced by a G1 / H1-structure, i.e. an affine structure foliated by parallel complex geodesics, if and only if the holonomy of the G / H-structure lies in the subgroup G1 and the developing map has image in [formula] lying inside the open orbit of G0.

Another related example: suppose that S is a complex surface with a complex affine structure, foliated by parallel geodesics. Locally we can construct coordinates [formula] on S which identify open sets of S with open sets of [formula], and identify the parallel geodesic foliation with the foliation of [formula] by vertical lines. Moreover, the transition maps will now preserve the vertical direction, and therefore are compositions of (1) translations, (2) rescalings of horizontal and vertical axes, and (3) addition of a linear function of t1 to t2. In particular, any graph of a polynomial function [formula] will remain a graph of a polynomial of the same degree. In the standard flat affine structure on the torus, there is a foliation by parallel geodesics in each direction, and associated to each such foliation is a translation invariant [formula]-structure for every n.

Let's return now to Hopf surfaces. Pick an eigenline of a linear Poincaré domain map F. The affine lines parallel to that line form an F-invariant foliation of [formula]. The associated [formula]-structure descends to the associated Hopf surface. Let's call this the [formula]-eigenstructure; there are two such for F with two distinct eigenvalues, one for F not diagonalizable, and infinitely many for F a homothety. Up to isomorphism of the Hopf surface and perhaps a permutation of indices, the eigenline can be arranged to be the vertical axis, with contraction map of the form [formula]. Then the developing map of the eigenstructure is given by [formula], and the holonomy generator is (g,0) where

[formula]

The image misses precisely the fiber of [formula] over the point [formula], and the origin of the fiber of [formula] over the point [formula]. The structure is incomplete but is essential.

Another example: take any compact curve C of genus g  ≥  0, and equip C with a projective structure. (Every curve admits a projective structure; see [\cite=Gunning:1978].) The holonomy morphism [formula] lifts to a morphism [formula] (see Gallo, Kapovich and Marden [\cite=Gallo/Kapovich/Marden:2000]). The developing map [formula] of the projective structure pulls back the [formula]-bundle to a line bundle over C. Cut out the zero section of this line bundle and quotient the fibers by any homothety w  →  aw with a  ≠  0. The result is an [formula]-structure on a principal fibration by elliptic curves over the curve of genus g. The developing maps of projective structures of curves of large genus can be very complicated (see Gallo, Kapovitch and Marden [\cite=Gallo/Kapovich/Marden:2000]), so the developing map of the [formula]-structure cannot be made explicit. The holonomy morphism [formula] takes the generator of [formula] to the homothety, and [formula] is the lift of the holonomy morphism of the projective structure on C. The structure is incomplete, but is essential.

The eigenstructures on exceptional Hopf surfaces

Pick any integers 0  <  m  ≤  n. Let (g,p)∈G be the element

[formula]

where ε is any solution of εn  =  λm. (We obtain the same element (g,p)∈G for any choice of ε.) This element (g,p) acts on [formula] via

[formula]

In particular, every exceptional Hopf surface of degree m has an [formula]-structure, for all n  ≥  m, which we call the eigenstructure on the exceptional Hopf surface. The holonomy generator is (g,p), and the developing map is [formula]. The image misses precisely the fiber of [formula] over the point [formula], and the origin of the fiber of [formula] over the point [formula]. In particular, the structure is incomplete, but is essential.

The hyperresonant structures on hyperresonant Hopf surfaces

A hyperresonant Hopf surface with hyperresonance λm11  =  λm22 may have additional [formula]-structures, which we will call hyperresonant structures. It has such structures just when it satisfies the conditions given in table , as we will see in section .

None of these are complete or essential structures, as the reader can easily check. The images in [formula] of the developing maps are complicated. The developing maps cover their images as finite unramified covering maps, with more than one sheet.

Classification on Hopf surfaces

Up to isomorphism, the [formula]-structures on Hopf surfaces are precisely those given in table , i.e. precisely the examples given in tables  and .

The proof of this theorem will occupy the remainder of this section. Note that every Hopf surface admits an [formula]-structure for some value of n. Every linear Hopf surface admits an [formula]-structure for all n  ≥  1. Every nonlinear Hopf surface only admits [formula]-structures for n  ≥  m where m is the degree of the Hopf surface.

Roughly speaking, even among hyperresonant Hopf surfaces, hyperresonant structures are somewhat rare. To be precise: a hyperresonant Hopf surface admits a hyperresonant [formula]-structure if and only if its hyperresonance [formula] has m2  =  n  m1 for some integer n, and then either (1) only admits hyperresonant [formula]-structures for that integer n or (2) if m1 = m2, admits hyperresonant [formula]-structures for all n  ≥  1.

Diagonal Hopf surfaces

Let's suppose that SF is a Hopf surface and F is diagonal linear, say

[formula]

Each [formula]-structure on SF has developing map a local biholomorphism [formula]. There is a holonomy generator [formula] so that [formula]. In the coordinates [formula] we constructed above on [formula], the developing map is a pair of meromorphic functions [formula]. In particular, [formula], where g acts here by linear fractional transformation. So t1 is a meromorphic section of a [formula]-bundle over our Hopf surface. By proposition , t1 must have the form

[formula]

and either (1) P1 and Q1 are constants or (2) λm11  =  λm22 is a hyperresonance. At the expense of changing the values of k1 and k2, we can assume that P1(u) and Q1(u) each have no zeroes at u = 0, and that they have no zeroes in common. The map t1 is the composition [formula], a composition of holomorphic submersions, so a holomorphic submersion. Therefore k1 =  - 1,0 or 1, and P1 and Q1 can't have multiple zeroes. The map t1 as written is not defined at z2 = 0, and we have to rewrite it in order to examine its behaviour near z2 = 0. It is convenient to rewrite the map as

[formula]

and the roots of P̃1 and 1 are the reciprocals of those of P1 and Q1. Then 2 must also be among - 1,0, or 1. These conditions together ensure that [formula] is a holomorphic submersion, and satisfies t1(F(z)) = g  t1(z). Moreover, they force g to have the form

[formula]

with k1 =  - 1,0 or 1 and 2 =  - 1,0 or 1 and c  ≠  0.

Generic holonomy on diagonal Hopf surfaces

Consider a diagonal Hopf surface with [formula]-structure. Assume that the holonomy generator (g,p) is generic, i.e. has the form (g,0), and the surface is diagonal.

A semiadmissible map for a diagonal Hopf surface SF with

[formula]

and with hyperresonance λm11  =  λm22 is a map [formula] of the form

[formula]

so that

the expressions P1(u),Q1(u),P2(u) are polynomials, where u = zm11 / zm22 and

none of these polynomials have any double roots, or roots at u = 0, and

no two of them have any common roots and

k1 and [formula] belong to the following list: and

the numbers 2,2 belong to this same list, where [formula] and [formula].

(We will discuss semiadmissible maps in this section only.)

Suppose that [formula] is a diagonal linear map in the Poincaré domain. A map [formula] is semiadmissible for the Hopf surface SF if and only if it is the developing map of a branched [formula]-structure on SF. The holonomy of the branched [formula]-structure is (g,0) where

[formula]

A semiadmissible map is equivariant under the action of F, so provides a branched [formula]-structure.

Clearly [formula]. So t2 is also a meromorphic section of a [formula]-bundle on the Hopf surface. Therefore [formula] for some integers [formula] and [formula], and

[formula]

Again, we can assume that P2 and Q2 have no roots at 0 and no roots in common. To have [formula] a local biholomorphism, P2 can't have any double roots, and [formula]. One of the two mappings

[formula]

must be defined at each point [formula]. It is not possible for t1 and t2 to have a common polynomial factor, because where this polynomial vanishes, the developing map will not be a local biholomorphism. When we look at the line z1 = 0, we see that this constrains us to the table of [formula] values above, and exactly the same is true of [formula] by the same reasoning. Clearly P2 cannot have any double zeroes, or else [formula] won't be a local biholomorphism. The functions t1,t2 cannot be defined where Q1 = 0 or where Q2 = 0, so [formula] must be defined. Therefore each zero of Q2 must cancel a zero of Qn1. But then the leftover zeroes of Qn1 cannot be double zeroes, so each zero of Q2 must occur with multiplicity precisely n - 1 or n. We can write Q2  =  RQn - 11, with R dividing Q1 and having no double roots. So we can write Q1  =  RS, with R and S having no common roots. It then follows that S is a factor of s1 and s2, so s1 and s2 have linearly dependent differentials at points where S = 0. These are points at which both s1 and s2 are holomorphic. Therefore S must be constant. Absorbing the constant, we have Q2 = Qn1.

Calculation on any semiadmissible map yields

[formula]

and so

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can see that semiadmissible maps are local biholomorphisms near z1 = 0 and near z2 = 0. They determine branched [formula]-structures. However, in order that the branched structure of a semiadmissible map be an unbranched structure, det t' must have no zeroes except at points where [formula] are not defined. Recall that if

[formula]

then

[formula]

The function R(u) has simple poles at the zeroes of P1(u) if A  ≠  0, at the zeroes of P2(u) if B  ≠  0, and at the zeroes of Q1(u) if C  ≠  0. If R(u) has any zeroes at finite values of u, then in order to keep det t'  ≠  0, we would need to have those zeroes occur somewhere where they can cancel out with poles from [formula]. So the finite zeroes of R(u) only occur at zeroes of Q1(u).

If C  ≠  0, then R(u) has poles at all of the zeroes of Q1(u), so no cancellations take place. But then R(u) must have at least deg Q1 zeroes (counting with multiplicity), so these must lie at infinity. If Q1(u) is constant, then no cancellations can take place, so R(u) can't have any zeroes at finite values of u, so again all zeroes of R(u) are at infinity. Therefore Q1(u) is constant or C = 0 or all zeroes of R(u) are at infinity.

A semiadmissible map is admissible if (in the above notation from this section)

either A = 0 or P1(u) is constant and

either B = 0 or P2(u) is constant and

either C = 0 or Q1(u) is constant and

R(u) = D is constant, not zero and

k1  ≠  0 or [formula].

(We will discuss admissible maps in this section only.)

A semiadmissible map which is local biholomorphism at every point of [formula] (i.e. not branched) is admissible.

Suppose that A  ≠  0. Let's pick one of the zeroes of P1(u), say a1, and write R(u) as

[formula]

Now solve R(u) = 0 for a1:

[formula]

Imagine varying the choice of P1, by varying a1 and leaving the other linear factors of P1 intact. We thereby vary the choice of t and so of R. We see that in order to force R(u) = 0 at a given value of u, we only have to set a1 as above. For generic choice of u, there is therefore a unique choice of a1 which will ensure R(u) = 0. So if we P1(u) is not constant, we can slightly alter P1(u) to ensure that R(u) has all its zeroes at finite locations away from the zeroes of Q1(u). Therefore generic choice of P1(u) will lead to a branched [formula]-structure, which has a nontrivial branch locus. The limit of the branch locus is still a compact curve in the Hopf surface, since the space of curves is compact. Therefore if A  ≠  0 and P1(u) is not constant, then the branched structure has nonempty branch locus. The same proof works for P2(u).

By the same argument, if Q1(u) is not constant, and C  ≠  0, then we can perturb to a branched structure, which has finite roots for R(u). Therefore this perturbed structure must have nonempty branch locus, and so our original branched structure had nonempty branch locus.

A semiadmissible map is admissible if and only if its branch locus is empty, i.e. it is the developing map of an [formula]-structure.

If we have an admissible map then our branched structure has no branch locus in the region in which the [formula] functions in equation [\ref=eqn:ts] are defined. Therefore we only need to then check the branch locus in all four coordinate charts: the [formula] and [formula] charts on [formula], and the expressions in z1,z2 with and without [formula] symbols on them, the charts on the Hopf surface. It is easy to check that when we change to the [formula] symbol coordinates, the corresponding quantities, in the obvious notation, are

[formula]

We can easily see that [formula] is constant just when P1(u) is constant and Ã = 0 just when A = 0, etc. Therefore admissibility is unchanged by such a coordinate transformation.

Let's write out our map in [formula] coordinates, say

[formula]

Then we find the dictionary

[formula]

Again, the admissibility of a semiadmissible map is unchanged by this coordinate transformation.

By semiadmissibility, we need D  ≠  0, so [formula]. By admissibility, we will also need D̃  ≠  0 so [formula]. We now have a tedious computation: for each of the 3 possible values of [formula] and the 3 possible values of [formula] from table  (except for (0,0)), we calculate A,B,C,D,Ã,,,D̃. In order that P1,Q1 and P2 not be all constant, we will need one of deg P1, deg Q1, deg P2 to be nonzero. If P1 is not constant, then A = 0, etc. To keep the branched [formula]-structure from branching, we will need D  ≠  0,D̃  ≠  0, and   ≠  0. The full story of manipulating these inequalities is totally elementary, so we will only explain fully one of the nine cases, and then leave all others to the reader, to avoid many pages of elementary arguments with inequalities.

Consider the case of an admissible map with [formula]. We find

[formula]

In particular, B = m1D and m1  ≠  0 because the hyperresonance has m1,m2  ≥  1. Moreover D  ≠  0, since the structure is not branched. Therefore B  ≠  0. By admissibility, P2 is a constant. We compute that   =   - 1 - m1 deg P2  +  m1n deg P1. Therefore C  =  m2. We can therefore say that C  ≠  0 and so Q1 is constant by admissibility. Assume that not all of P1,P2,Q1 are constant. Clearly now A = m1  n  -  m2, and so m2  =  m1n. Plugging this in gives 0  ≠  D =  - 1  +  m1n deg P1, so m1n deg P1  ≠  1, and so m1n deg P1  >  1 since m1,n, deg P1  ≥  1. Therefore m1  >  1 or n  >  1 or deg P1  >  1. All eight other cases follow essentially the same reasoning.

Tedious computation of all nine cases yields the conditions of table  in order that the structure is unbranched and P1(u),P2(u) and Q1(u) are not all forced to be constant. The impossible cases come from inconsistency of the degrees of the polynomials P1,Q1, and P2.

On the other hand, if P1,Q1 and P2 are all assumed to be constants, and the structure is unbranched (i.e. D  ≠  0) then we can arrange that k1  ≥  0 by replacing [formula] coordinates by [formula] coordinates, and then we see that the possible values of [formula] and [formula] are given in table .

Note that with P1,Q1 and P2 constants, we can rescale z1 and z2 independently, since these rescalings commute with our linear map F, and thereby absorb constants as needed. After such absorptions, we find the developing maps in table . It is easy to see that the first line of this table is isomorphic to the second via the isomorphism (g,p) = (g,0) with

[formula]

Clearly the second and fourth lines of table  are eigenstructures, while the third is a radial structure.

On any generic Hopf surface, the [formula]-structures with generic holonomy, up to isomorphism, are the radial structures and eigenstructures.

Just plug in the values in table  into the general expression of a semiadmissible map, with the added information that all of the polynomials in u must be constants, to find that up to isomorphism:

On any hyperresonant Hopf surface, with hyperresonance λm11  =  λm22, the [formula]-structures with generic holonomy, up to isomorphism, are precisely

the radial structures,

the eigenstructures, and

the hyperresonant structures.

Just plug in the values from table  and you find table .

Nongeneric holonomy on diagonal Hopf surfaces

Suppose that [formula] is the holonomy of an [formula]-structure on a Hopf surface. Then g has infinite order, i.e. gN  ≠  I for any integer N  ≠  0.

Suppose that g has finite order, say gN = I, N  ≥  1. By lemma , we can assume that (g,p) is in normal form. In particular we can assume that g is diagonal. Suppose that [formula] is the holonomy of an [formula]-structure on a Hopf surface SF. Let FN be the N-fold composition [formula]. Then [formula] is the holonomy of the pullback [formula]-structure on the Hopf surface SFN via the obvious covering map SFN  →  SF. Therefore, by possibly replacing SF with SFN, we can assume that g = I.

Suppose that the developing map of the [formula]-structure, in affine coordinates, is [formula]. Because g = I, t1 must be F-invariant, i.e. [formula] is a nonconstant rational function. Therefore F must be a hyperresonant map, say

[formula]

for some complex numbers λ1,λ2 with [formula], with hyperresonance λm11  =  λm22. Moreover, t1 = P(u) / Q(u) for some polynomials P and Q, where u = zm11 / zm22. The function t2 must then satisfy

[formula]

The developing map is a local biholomorphism, so [formula] is a submersion to [formula]. We can factor t1 into [formula], and so [formula] must be a local biholomorphism, and so a linear fractional transformation. After replacing our developing map and holonomy by [formula], using an element (g,0)∈G, we can arrange that P(u) / Q(u) = u, i.e. [formula]. Clearly [formula] must be a submersion, and so m1 = m2 = 1, i.e. the hyperresonance is λ1  =  λ2, and we can write [formula] for some [formula] with [formula].

If we pick any point where [formula] are not defined as complex valued functions, then at that point [formula] must be defined. So

[formula]

must be defined. In particular, zn2s2 must be defined at such a point. So the function T = zn2s2 is defined and holomorphic at every point of [formula] and so at every point of [formula]. Since we know how t2 behaves under holonomy action, we find

[formula]

Expanding T into a power series, we find that p = 0.

So now (g,p) = (I,0), and t1 and t2 are both F-invariant meromorphic functions on [formula], i.e. meromorphic functions on SF, i.e. rational functions of u = zm11 / zm22, so [formula]. But then [formula] is not a local biholomorphism.

The holonomy generator (g,p) of any [formula]-structure on any diagonalizable Hopf surface, up to conjugation, has p = 0 or p a monic monomial.

By lemma , either p = 0 or p is monomial or g has finite order. Finite order g is impossible by lemma .

The holonomy of any [formula]-structure on any diagonalizable Hopf surface is generic.

We can assume that the map F determining our Hopf surface is linear, diagonal,

[formula]

and hyperresonant, with hyperresonance [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is a diagonal linear map in the Poincaré domain, [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is the developing map of an [formula]-structure on the associated Hopf surface SF, with holonomy generator [formula]. Then in affine coordinates, this developing map has the form [formula], where t1 must be a section of a flat projective line bundle associated to (F,g). By proposition ,

[formula]

for some nonzero complex number c, and

[formula]

for u = zm11 / zm22. (If g is not hyperresonant, we take P1(u) and Q1(u) to be constants.) We can assume that neither of P1 and Q1 have any double roots, or roots at u = 0, and that neither of them have any common roots, and that k1 =  - 1,0,1 and k2 =  - 1,0,1 as before since [formula] is a submersion.

By lemma , if the holonomy (g,p) is not generic, then we arrange that p is a monic monomial, say

[formula]

for some nonzero complex number c, and

[formula]

and

[formula]

for u = zm11 / zm22. We can assume that neither of these polynomials have any double roots, or roots at u = 0, and that neither of them have any common roots, and that k1 =  - 1,0,1 and k2 =  - 1,0,1. In order that p be resonant, we will need

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

Next consider t2. At this stage, we can see that

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then compute out

[formula]

so that f is a meromorphic section of a flat projective line bundle,

[formula]

where

[formula]

By proposition , the only meromorphic section of this line bundle is f =   ∞  , a contradiction.

Summing up:

The only [formula]-structures on diagonalizable Hopf surfaces are

the radial structures,

the eigenstructures and

the hyperresonant structures in table .

Exceptional Hopf surfaces

Diagonalizable holonomy on exceptional Hopf surfaces

Up to isomorphism, the only [formula]-structure on an exceptional Hopf surface which has diagonalizable holonomy is the eigenstructure.

Suppose that [formula] is the developing map of an [formula]-structure on an exceptional Hopf surface SF, where [formula]. Suppose that the holonomy is (g,p), and that g is diagonalizable, say

[formula]

By proposition , up to isomorphism we must have

[formula]

some integer k, and a1 / a2  =  λk. But then either t1 is branched, along z1 = 0, if k > 1, or else

[formula]

is branched if k < 1. Up to isomorphism, we can therefore ensure that k = 1, and that

[formula]

and a1 / a2  =  λ and

[formula]

By the usual trick of writing t2 in terms of Weierstrass polynomials,

[formula]

with W1(z) and W2(z) polynomial in the variable z2, we see that W2(z) must transform under composition with F by scaling, so

[formula]

for some constant c  ≠  0 and integer k  ≥  0. We can write

[formula]

for some holomorphic function T(z) defined near the origin. Calculate that

[formula]

Differentiate both sides with respect to z2 to find

[formula]

so that [formula] is a section of a line bundle over an exceptional Hopf surface, so

[formula]

for some [formula] and constant c and

[formula]

So

[formula]

for some holomorphic function [formula], which is then forced to satisfy

[formula]

Expand out p as

[formula]

and

[formula]

(with the understanding that Cj = 0 when j < 0 or j > n and that bj = 0 when j < 0) to see that

[formula]

If we plug in [formula], we find

[formula]

and [formula] is arbitrary. For all other values of [formula],

[formula]

We now see that a1  =  λa2 and that [formula], giving the eigenvalues of g. Therefore (g,p) is generic as long as either [formula] (g contracting) or [formula] (g expanding). So we can assume that p = 0 or else that [formula]. If ai1an - i2 = 1, then plugging in a1 and then an2, we find that [formula], and 0  ≤  i  ≤  n. By lemma  there is only this one possible value of i giving a coefficient Ci of p which we can't assume is 0 without loss of generality. Therefore we can arrange

[formula]

and

[formula]

for some complex constant [formula].

To see if this structure is branched, compute

[formula]

So the structure is unbranched except possibly at z1 = 0. Since [formula], s1 is not defined at z1 = 0, and therefore we cannot use the coordinates s1,s2 to fix up the branch locus at z1 = 0. Therefore t1 and t2 must be defined at z1 = 0, so that [formula]. Moreover [formula] can't vanish at z1 = 0, so [formula], yielding

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can conjugate by a suitable isomorphism to arrange that Cm = 1 and that b = 0, so that our [formula]-structure is the eigenstructure on the exceptional Hopf surface.

Nondiagonalizable holonomy on exceptional Hopf surfaces

The only exceptional Hopf surfaces which admit [formula]-structures with holonomy (g,p) with g nondiagonalizable are the linear nondiagonalizable Hopf surfaces. Up to isomorphism, the only such [formula]-structures they admit are the radial ones.

Suppose that [formula] is the developing map of an [formula]-structure on an exceptional Hopf surface SF, where [formula]. Suppose that the holonomy is (g,p), and that g is not diagonalizable, say

[formula]

By lemma , we can assume either (1) (g,p) = (g,0) or else (2)

[formula]

In either case, t1 is a meromorphic section of the obvious flat projective line bundle. Let's consider case (2). By proposition ,

[formula]

for some constant c. In particular, t1  =    ∞   at z1 = 0. Therefore at z1 = 0, s1 and s2 must be holomorphic. Clearly

[formula]

Therefore s1 branches along z1 = 0 unless m = 1. We can check that

[formula]

In particular, along the line z1 = 0, we find that s1 = 0 and so

[formula]

Since s2 is holomorphic on the entire line z1 = 0, except perhaps at z2 = 0, we can compute a Laurent series expansion for s2 and see that the constant term is inconsistent.

Therefore we can assume that we are in case (1): p = 0. By proposition , up to isomorphism we must have

[formula]

But then

[formula]

is branched unless m = 1. So now let's assume that m = 1. Our Hopf surface is linear but not diagonalizable, and

[formula]

and

[formula]

By proposition , this ensures that t2 = c  zk1 for some integer k, and that

[formula]

On the line z1 = 0, t1 is infinite, so s1 and s2 must be finite. Similarly, on z2 = 0, s1 is infinite, so t1 and t2 must be finite, and have linearly independent differentials. Note that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Along z1 = 0, s2 must be finite and [formula]. In particular t2 has a pole of order no more than n along z1 = 0. Compute

[formula]

The only possible zero of this holomorphic 2-form occurs along the line z1 = 0, but t1 and t2 are not defined there, so we turn to s1 and s2 to see what happens near z1 = 0. Compute

[formula]

To get this to give a finite nonzero value along z1 = 0, we need k =  - n. Finally, composing with [formula] where λn0 = c gives a developing map which is identical to the developing map of the radial structure, and gives the same holonomy.

Summing up:

Up to isomorphism, the only [formula]-structures on any exceptional Hopf surface are

the eigenstructure and

on a linear exceptional Hopf surface, the radial structure.

This completes the proof of theorem .

Locally homogeneous geometric structures inducing these structures

The Zariski closure of the subgroup of [formula] generated by a matrix

[formula]

with neither a1 nor a2 on the unit circle is

[formula]

Suppose that [formula] is a complex polynomial vanishing on all of the points [formula] for all integers k. From among all monomials Zj11Zj22 which occur in p with nonzero coefficient, pick one for which aj11aj22 is largest in absolute value. Let

[formula]

Then [formula] for all integers k. Consider how each monomial in p contributes to fn. A monomial [formula] yields a term

[formula]

Write aj = rjeiθj. At [formula], this term yields

[formula]

This term goes to 0 as n  →    ∞   unless [formula] and [formula] is a multiple of 2π, i.e. vanishes. In particular, the term coming from the monomial Zj11Zj22 yields a nonzero contribution in the limit. But in the limit [formula], so some other monomial must cancel Zj11Zj22. Therefore there must be some pairs [formula] and [formula] for which [formula]. So g is hyperresonant. The terms in fn which don't vanish in the limit as n  →    ∞   must all have powers of Z1 and Z2 differing from [formula] by integer multiples of the hyperresonance of g.

We can grade each monomial Zk11Zk22, by sliding [formula] over by integer multiples of the hyperresonance until we make k1 as small as possible, and using the resulting k1 value as the grading. We can write each polynomial [formula] as a sum of graded pieces. Suppose [formula] vanishes on all of the points [formula]. Let's write [formula] as a sum of graded pieces. Consider again these functions [formula]. Taking the limit

[formula]

only the terms from the highest graded piece enter into the limit. If

[formula]

is the highest graded piece, then

[formula]

Modulo the hyperresonance relation Zn11 - Zn22, each term in [formula] can be shifted over to become a multiple of one single term:

[formula]

Let [formula] be the subgroup fixing a point of [formula]. There is an obvious Lie group morphism [formula] where as above

[formula]

Every [formula]-structure on any linear Hopf surface is induced by its [formula]-structure.

We map [formula] by the identity map in affine coordinates, and then map [formula] by the embedding g  ↦  (g,0).

The holonomy group of any [formula]-structure on any Hopf surface SF is contained in [formula], precisely if the [formula]-structures is the eigenstructure of

a hyperresonant linear map F with eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 and hyperresonance either

λn1  =  λ22 or

λn / 21  =  λ2,

or

a nondiagonalizable linear map F when n = 2, i.e. an [formula]-structure.

Just take determinants of the holonomy generators. Note that there are two distinct eigenstructures for a diagonalizable linear map F, corresponding to the two distinct eigenspaces.

Suppose that some G' / H'-structure induces the [formula]-structure on some linear Hopf surface. Then [formula] is onto or else [formula] is onto.

There are no other subgroups of [formula] which act transitively on [formula]; see Huckleberry and Livorno [\cite=Huckleberry/Livorno:1981].

The eigenstructure on a linear Hopf surface SF is induced, as we have already proven, by the G0 / H0-structure, where G0 is the group of linear transformations of [formula] preserving an eigenspace of the linear map F.

The radial structure on the generic Hopf surface is induced by the [formula]-structure on [formula] and by no proper subgroup of [formula].

For a generic Hopf surface, the radial and eigen structures will have holonomy generator Zariski dense in the diagonal matrices. That ensures that for any holomorphic reduction, say to a G' / H'-structure, G' will have to map onto a subgroup of G containing the diagonal matrices. Moreover, G' will have an open orbit in [formula], containing at least the open orbit of the diagonal matrices, which is everything except the fibers over 0 and ∞   and the 0-section. However, the radial structure has everything but the 0-section in its image, so we will need G' to have as image a larger group than just the diagonal subgroup. Indeed our group G' will need to act transitively on [formula], so must map onto [formula] by the classification of homogeneous surfaces (see Huckleberry and Livorno [\cite=Huckleberry/Livorno:1981]). Any subgroup of [formula] mapping onto [formula] will have to contain [formula] and therefore the image of G' must contain all of [formula].

Conclusions

We have found all of the [formula]-structures on all Hopf surfaces explicitly, by computed their developing maps and holonomy groups explicitly. This makes it possible to determine which of these structures are induced from other locally homogeneous geometric structures on Hopf surfaces. The one surprising result of the classification is the appearance of the hyperresonant [formula]-structures (on the hyperresonant Hopf surfaces). The hyperresonant [formula]-structures have no apparent geometric or intuitive description. They depend on the prescence of complicated meromorphic functions (rational functions in the canonical affine structure), and so disappear on the Hopf surfaces with trivial function fields.

The relation of these results to Wall's results [\cite=Wall:1985] [\cite=Wall:1986] deserves some clarification. The full picture, of all holomorphic locally homogeneous geometric structures on compact complex surfaces, and which are induced from which, is still hidden. It seems likely that this picture will soon become clear. The classification of holomorphic Cartan geometries on compact complex surfaces would then appear to be within reach. We have to keep in mind that the explicit classification of holonomy morphisms and developing maps for holomorphic projective connections on complex algebraic curves is still unknown, and perhaps too complicated to be classifiable (see [\cite=Gallo/Kapovich/Marden:2000]). Therefore we would only hope to classify holomorphic Cartan geometries on compact complex surfaces modulo the classification on curves. It seems likely that holomorphic Cartan geometries can be classified on linear Hopf manifolds in all dimensions.
