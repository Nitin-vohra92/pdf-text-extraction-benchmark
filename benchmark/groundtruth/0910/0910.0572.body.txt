Nonrigidity of a class of two dimensional surfaces with positive curvature and planar points

Introduction

The problem considered here deals with the bendings of an orientable, embedded surface S in [formula]. We assume that S has a vanishing first homology group, that [formula] is a C∞ compact surface with boundary, that it has positive curvature except at finitely many planar points in S. The main result states that for any [formula], S has nontrivial infinitesimal bendings of class Ck. That is, there is a Ck function [formula] such that the first fundamental form of the deformation surface Sσ  =  {p + σU(p), p∈S} satisfies dS2σ = dS2 + O(σ2) as σ  →  0, where σ is a real parameter. Furthermore, Sσ is not obtained from S through a rigid motion of [formula]. A consequence of this result is the nonrigidity of S in the following sense. Any given ε-neighborhood of S (for the Ck topology) contains isometric surfaces that are not congruent.

The study of bendings of surfaces in [formula] has a rich history and many physical applications. In particular, it is used in the theory of elastic shells. We refer to the survey article of Sabitov ([\cite=SABITOV1]) and the references therein. The results of this paper are also related to those contained in the following papers [\cite=BLEE], [\cite=EFIMOV], [\cite=GREENE], [\cite=KANN], [\cite=KARATO], [\cite=MEZCAG], [\cite=MEZJDE], [\cite=POGO1], [\cite=USMANOV1], [\cite=SABITOV2]

Our approach is through the study of the associated (complex) field of asymptotic directions on S. We prove that such a vector field generates an integrable structure on [formula]. We reformulate the equations for the bending field U in terms of a Bers-Vekua type equation (with singularities). Then use recent results about the solvability of such equations to construct the bending fields.

Integrability of the field of asymptotic directions

For the surfaces considered here, we show that the field of asymptotic directions on S has a global first integral.

Let [formula] be an orientable C∞ surface with a C∞ boundary. We assume that H1(S) = 0. The surface S is diffeomorphic to a relatively compact domain [formula] with a C∞ boundary. Hence,

[formula]

where the position vector [formula] is a C∞ parametrization of [formula]. Let E, F, G and e, f, g be the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms of S. Thus,

[formula]

where [formula] is the unit normal of S. The Gaussian curvature of S is [formula]. We assume that [formula] has positive curvature except at a finite number of planar points in S. That is, there exist [formula] such that

[formula]

The (complex) asymptotic directions on S are given by the quadratic equation

[formula]

Thus [formula] except at the planar points [formula] where λ = 0.

Consider the structure on [formula] generated by the [formula]-valued vector field

[formula]

This structure is elliptic on [formula]. That is, L and [formula] are independent outside the planar points. The next proposition shows that L has a global first integral on [formula].

Proof.Since L is C∞ and elliptic on [formula], then it follows from the uniformization of complex structures on planar domains (see[\cite=SPRINGER]) that there exists a C∞ diffeomorphism

[formula]

such that LZ = 0. It remains to show that Z has the form (1.5) in a neighborhood of a planar point.

Let pj be a planar point of S. We can assume that S is given in a neighborhood of pj as the graph of a function z = z(x,y) with pj = (0,0), z(0,0) = 0, and zx(0,0) = zy(0,0) = 0. The assumption on the curvature implies that

[formula]

where zm(x,y) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree m > 2, satisfying zxxzyy - z2xy > 0 for (x,y)  ≠  0. We can also assume that z(x,y) > 0 for (x,y)  ≠  0. The complex structure generated by the asymptotic directions is given by the vector field

[formula]

With respect to the polar coordinates x = ρ cos φ, y = ρ sin φ, we get

[formula]

where P(φ) is a trigonometric polynomial of degree m satisfying P(φ) > 0 and (curvature)

[formula]

With respect to the coordinates (ρ,φ), the vector field L becomes

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

We know (see[\cite=MEZJFA]) that such a vector field L0 is integrable in a neighborhood of the circle ρ = 0. Moreover, we can find coordinates (r,θ) in which L0 is C1-conjugate to the model vector field

[formula]

where μj > 0 is given by

[formula]

The function [formula] is a first integral of T in r > 0.

Now we prove that the function Z which is defined in [formula] extends to pj with the desired form given by (1.5). Let Oj be a disc centered at pj where L is conjugate to a multiple of T in the (r,θ) coordinates. Since uj and Z are both first integrals of L in the punctured disc [formula], then there exists a holomorphic function hj defined on the image [formula] such that Z(r,t) = hj(uj(r,t)). Since both Z and uj are homeomorphisms onto their images, then hj is one to one in a neighborhood of [formula] and since hj is bounded, then

[formula]

with C1  ≠  0. This means that after a linear change of the coordinates (r,θ) (to remove the constant C1) , the function Z has the form (1.5) [formula]

Equations of the bending fields in terms of L

Let S be a surface given by (1.1). An infinitesimal bending of class Ck of S is a deformation surface [formula], with [formula] a parameter, given by the position vector

[formula]

whose first fundamental form satisfies

[formula]

This means that the bending field [formula] is of class Ck and satisfies

[formula]

The trivial bendings of S are those induced by the rigid motions of [formula]. They are given by U(s,t) = A  ×  R(s,t) + B, where A and B are constants in [formula], and where ×   denotes the vector product in [formula].

Let L be the field of asymptotic directions defined by (1.4). For each function [formula], we associate the [formula]-valued function w defined by

[formula]

where u = Rs  ·  U and v = Rt  ·  U. The following theorem proved in [\cite=MEZCONT] will be used in the next section.

If [formula] satisfies (2.2), then the function w given by (2.3) satisfies the equation

[formula]

where

[formula]

Remark 2.1 If w solves equation (2.4). The function w' = aw, where a is a nonvanishing function solves the same equation with the vector field L replaced by L' = aL

Main Results

Let S be a surface given by (1.1) and such that its curvature K satisfies (1.2). Then for every [formula], the surface S has a nontrivial infinitesimal bending [formula] of class Ck.

Remark 3.1 It should be mentioned that without the assumption that K > 0 up to the boundary ∂S, the surface could be rigid under infinitesimal bendings. Indeed, let T2 be a standard torus in [formula], it is known (see[\cite=AUDOLY] or [\cite=POGO2]) that if S consists of the portion of T2 with positive curvature, then S is rigid under infinitesimal bendings. Here the curvature vanishes on ∂S.

Before we proceed with the proof, we give a consequence of Theorem 3.1.

Let S be as in Theorem 3.1. Then for every ε > 0 and for every [formula], there exist surfaces Σ+ and Σ- of class Ck in the ε-neighborhood of S (for the Ck-topology) such that Σ+ and Σ- are isometric but not congruent.

Proof.Let [formula] be a nontrivial infinitesimal bending of S of class Ck. Consider the surfaces Σσ and Σ-  σ defined the position vectors

[formula]

Since dR  ·  dU = 0, then dR2±  σ = dR2  +  σ2dU2. Hence Σσ and Σ-  σ are isometric. Furthermore, since U is nontrivial, then Σσ and Σ-  σ are not congruent (see [\cite=SPIVAK]). For a given ε > 0, the surfaces Σ±  σ are contained in the ε-neighborhood of S if σ is small enough [formula]

Proof of Theorem 3.1. First we construct non trivial solutions w of equation (2.4) and then deduce the infinitesimal bending fields U. For this, we use the first integral Z of L to transform equation (2.4) into a Bers-Vekua type equation with singularities. Let [formula] be the images of the planar points by the function Z. The pushforward of equation (2.4) via Z gives rise to an equation of the form

[formula]

where w(s,t) = W(Z(s,t)) and [formula] The local study of the solutions of such equations near a singularity is considered in [\cite=MEZCVEE], [\cite=TUNG], [\cite=USMANOV2]. To construct a global solution of (3.1) with the desired properties, we proceed as follows. We seek a solution W in the form W(Z) = H(Z)W1(Z), where

[formula]

where M is a (large) positive integer to be chosen. In order for W = HW1 to solve (3.1), the function W1 needs to solve the modified equation

[formula]

Since A and [formula] are bounded functions on [formula], then a result of [\cite=TUNG] gives a continuous solution W1 of (3.2) on [formula]. Furthermore, such a solutions is C∞ on [formula] since the equation is elliptic and the coefficients are C∞ outside the Zj's.

The function W(Z) = H(Z)W1(Z) is therefore a solution of (3.1). It is C∞ on [formula] and vanishes to order M at each point Zj. Consequently, the function w(s,t) = W(Z(s,t)) is C∞ on [formula] and vanishes to order Mμj at each planar point (μj is the positive number appearing in Proposition 1.1).

Now we recover the bending field U from the solution w of (2.4) and the relation w = LR  ·  U. Set w = gu + λv, where λ is the asymptotic direction given in (1.3). The functions u and v are uniquely determined by

[formula]

provided that the function w vanishes to a high order at the planar points (order of vanishing of W at pj larger than that of the curvature). These functions are C∞ outside the planar points. At each planar point pj, it mj is the order of vanishing of K, then the functions v and u vanish to order Mμj - mj. It follows from LR  ·  U = w that Rs  ·  U = u and Rt  ·  U = v. The condition dR  ·  dU = 0 implies that

[formula]

In terms of the components (x,y,z) of R and (ξ,η,ζ) of U, we have

[formula]

(equation (2.4) guarantees the compatibility of this system). Note that at each point [formula] where K > 0, the functions ξ, η, and ζ are uniquely determined by u, v, and us (or vt). Indeed, at such a point the determinant of the first three equations of (3.4) is

[formula]

With our choice that w (and so u and v) vanishing to an order larger than that of the curvature at each planar point, the functions ξ, η, and ζ are also uniquely determined to be 0 at each planar point. To see why, assume that at pj, we have xsyt - xtys  ≠  0, then after solving the first two equations for ξ and η in terms of ζ, u, and v, the third equations becomes,

[formula]

Since the zeros pj of Rss  ·  (Rs  ×  Rt) is isolated and since u and v vanish to a high order at pj, the function ζ is well defined by (3.5). Consequently, for any given [formula], a nonzero solution w of (2.4) which vanishes at high orders (M large), gives rise to a unique field of infinitesimal bending U of S, so that it is C∞ on [formula] and vanishes to an order k at each pj. Such a field is therefore of class Ck at each planar point. It remains to verify that U is not trivial. If such a field were trivial (U = A  ×  R + B), then the vanishing of dU = A  ×  dR at pj together with dR  ·  dU = 0 gives A = 0 and so U = B = 0 since U = 0 at pj. This would give [formula] which is a contradiction [formula]
