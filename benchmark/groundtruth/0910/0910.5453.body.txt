Introduction

A Coxeter group is a group W of linear transformations of a Euclidean space generated by reflections. Irreducible finite Coxeter groups are labelled by Al, Bl, Dl, E6, E7, E8, F4, G2, H3, H4 and I2(p) [\cite=Cox1]. The orbit space of such groups can be endowed with a structure of Frobenius manifold, due to B.Dubrovin [\cite=Du96] and to the previous work by K.Saito, T.Yano and J.Sekiguchi [\cite=Sa79] [\cite=Sa93] [\cite=SYS]. Flat coordinates, a key ingredient for the structure, correspond to a particular choice of generators of the ring of W-invariant polynomials. They have been calculated explicitely by Saito et al. for all irreducible finite Coxeter groups but E7 and E8. In the framework of singularity theory, flat coordinates on the base space of universal unfoldings of isolated hypersurface singularities have been calculated also for E7 and E8 type [\cite=Ya] [\cite=Kat]. The potentials for E7 and E8 type Coxeter groups have been calculated in [\cite=DLZ], but without relating them to an explicit construction of the flat generators. In this note, after briefly recalling the main ingredients of Frobenius manifold structures on the orbit space of finite Coxeter groups, I consider the two cases not treated in [\cite=SYS], deriving explicit expressions for the Saito flat coordinates via generators of the ring of E7- and E8-invariant polynomials proposed by M.Mehta [\cite=Meh]. I am very grateful to my supervisor, Prof. B.Dubrovin, for pointing out to me this problem, for fruitful discussions about the subject and for his continuous encouragement and support.

Frobenius manifolds and Coxeter groups

A Frobenius algebra [formula] over a ring R is an associative R-algebra with a unity and a symmetric non-degenerate R-bilinear inner product (,) such that, for any a,b,c∈A:

[formula]

A (complex) Frobenius manifold M is a [formula]-manifold with a commutative Frobenius algebra structure over each tangent plane, analytically depending on the coordinates of the point and satisfying a few integrability conditions:

The metric ηαβ on M defined by the inner product (,) is flat;

The unity vector field e defined by the algebras is covariantly constant with respect to the Levi-Civita connection defined by ηαβ [formula];

The tensor [formula] is totally symmetric for any vector fields u,v,w,z.

The metric ηαβ also defines a contravariant metric ηαβ on the cotangent bundle T*M, where another flat metric gαβ can be constructed [\cite=Du96], giving rise to a flat pencil of metrics gαβ  +  ληαβ, [formula]. Locally a Frobenius structure can be described, in a suitable set of coordinates [formula], named flat, by the third derivatives of a function on the manifold F(t) called Frobenius potential. In such coordinates the metric ηαβ is constant and is given by: where t1 is such that [formula], while the structure constants of the Frobenius algebras on TtM are given by: A Coxeter group W is a group of linear transformations on a Euclidean space V generated by reflections. The space of orbits V / W of a finite Coxeter group is an affine variety; its coordinate ring coincides with the ring of W-invariant polynomials on V [\cite=Che]. The generators of such a ring are not uniquely specified, but their degrees [formula] are invariants of the group; the highest degree h is called Coxeter number. The complexification of the orbit space [formula] can be endowed with a structure of Frobenius manifold. The two marked flat metrics have been worked out by K.Saito et al.[\cite=Sa79] [\cite=Sa93] [\cite=SYS], while the full construction is due to B.Dubrovin [\cite=Du96]. We refer to his article for proofs of the following statements. Let x = (x1,..,xn) be coordinates on V and [formula] be local coordinates on M, where pdi = pdi(x) are homogeneous generators of the ring of W-invariant polynomials. The second order generator p2 fixes a W-invariant Euclidean metric Gij on V via [formula]. This induces a contravariant flat metric on T*M [\cite=Sa79] [\cite=Du96] by:

[formula]

where (Gij) = (Gij)- 1. On the other hand, ηαβ is defined by:

[formula]

The matrix of ηαβ becomes constant once we calculate (Saito) flat coordinates [formula]. Dubrovin showed the existence of a relation between gαβ(t) and the Frobenius potential [\cite=Du96], given by:

[formula]

This formula will allow us to reconstruct the potential (and hence the full Frobenius structure) from the knowledge of flat coordinates.

Generators of W-invariant polynomials

Systems of generators of W-invariant polynomials are well known for all irreducible finite Coxeter groups but the exceptional ones, labelled by E6, E7, E8, for which very few and often cumbersome examples exist in the literature. In this note we use a construction due to M.Mehta [\cite=Meh], that has the advantage of being very natural to work out. For any W, we find a set of linear forms that is W-invariant, in the sense that, under the action of the group on the algebra of polynomials, the elements of the set transform into each other, leaving unchanged the whole set. Then we consider symmetric functions on these forms in the required degrees.

Basic polynomials for E6

The action of the group E6 on [formula] is generated by reflections in the six hyperplanes x1 = x2, x2 = x3,,x5 = x6 and x1 + x2 + x3 + x7 = x4 + x5 + x6 + x8, all operating on the six dimensional subspace [formula], x7 + x8 = 0. We first look for a set of polynomials in 8 variables, symmetric in [formula] and in x7,x8 and invariant under reflection in the hyperplane x1 + x2 + x3 + x7 = x4 + x5 + x6 + x8. Apart from the obvious choices of S6 and x7 + x8, the following linear forms satisfy the above requirements:

[formula]

[formula]

So the polynomials of the form:

[formula]

are manifestly invariant for any m. Restricting these polynomials to S6 = 0, x7 + x8 = 0 yields the standard realization of E6 [\cite=Meh]. We recall that the E6-invariant degrees are 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 12 [\cite=Cox1]. It turns out [\cite=Cox2] that u2, u5, u6, u8, u9 and u12 are algebraically independent and form a system of generators for the ring of invariant polynomials of the E6 type. We normalize the second order polynomial as u2 / 12 (we will continue to call it u2 for convenience), in such a way that it has as small as possible integer coefficients.

Basic polynomials for E7

The action of the group E7 on [formula] is generated by reflections in the seven hyperplanes x1 = x2, x2 = x3,,x6 = x7 and x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 + x7 + x8, all operating on the seven dimensional subspace [formula]. We first look for a set of polynomials in 8 variables, symmetric in [formula] and invariant under reflection in the hyperplane x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 + x7 + x8. Apart from the obvious choice of S7, the following linear forms satisfy the above requirements:

[formula]

So the polynomials of the form: are manifestly invariant for any m. Restricting the action of the group on S7 = 0 yields the standard realization of E7 [\cite=Meh]. We recall that the E7-invariant degrees are 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 18 [\cite=Cox1]. It turns out [\cite=Meh] that v2, v6, v8, v10, v12, v14 and v18 are algebraically independent and form a system of generators for the ring of invariant polynomials of the E7 type. We normalize the second order polynomial as v2 / 60 (we will continue to call it v2 for convenience), in such a way that it has as small as possible integer coefficients.

Basic polynomials for E8

The action of the group E8 on [formula] is generated by reflections in the eight hyperplanes x1 = x2, x2 = x3,,x7 = x8 and [formula], all operating on the eight dimensional subspace [formula]. We first look for a set of polynomials in 9 variables, symmetric in [formula] and invariant under reflection in the hyperplane [formula]. Apart from the obvious choice of S8, the following linear forms satisfy the above requirements:

[formula]

[formula]

So the polynomials of the form: are manifestly invariant for any even m. Restricting the action of the group on S8 = 0 yields the standard realization of E8 [\cite=Meh]. We recall that the E8-invariant degrees are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24 and 30 [\cite=Cox1]. It turns out [\cite=Meh] that w2, w8, w12, w14, w18, w20, w24 and w30 are algebraically independent and form a system of generators for ring of invariant polynomials of the E8 type. We normalize the second order polynomial as w2 / 30 (we will continue to call it w2 for convenience), in such a way that it has as small as possible integer coefficients.

Flat coordinates

We present the explicit calculations needed to find the Frobenius structure for E6. Analogous procedures will allow us to obtain the structures for E7 and E8. We first need to write the metric ([\ref=met]) with respect to the generators proposed by Mehta. For each matrix element <  dudα,dudβ   > *, we start finding all possible monic monomials in [formula] in the needed degree. Any such monomial b must be written in the form: where [formula] and [formula]. The next step consists in finding the (rational) coefficients a(c,i)'s of the linear combination:

[formula]

where the sum is over all allowed sets of parameters (c,i). This calculation is crucial from a computational point of view in our work; in fact, due to the high degrees of the polynomials and to the number of variables involved, standard computational software programs do not seem to be able to manage easily such an amount of information, that increases in complexity much more than linearly with the degree of the involved polynomials. For this reason, we evaluate the expressions ([\ref=go]) at points [formula] such that [formula]. It turns out that, for k generic choices of the n-tuple [formula], this procedure gives a - much easier to manage - determined linear system of equations in the a(c,i)'s. In Appendix A we present the matrix elements of the metric gαβ with respect to the Mehta generators for E6, from which we can calculate the elements of the matrix ηαβ different from zero:

[formula]

To find a flat basis, we now write the general homogeneous polynomials of degrees 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 12 belonging to our coordinate ring:

[formula]

where ki are free coefficients. Calculating the matrix elements of ηαβ with respect to these new coordinates and asking for all the terms but the antidiagonal ones to be zero, we find an overdetermined system of equations that provides the coefficients needed to construct the Saito coordinates. We prefer to normalize some of the flat polynomials in such a way that all the elements in the antidiagonal are equal, as usual in the literature.

[formula]

This result is already available in [\cite=SYS] with different coefficients, because of a different choice of coordinates on V done by the authors. At this point we can calculate the matrix elements of gαβ(t) and, using [\eqref=sec], the Frobenius potential:

The resulting Frobenius potential is:
