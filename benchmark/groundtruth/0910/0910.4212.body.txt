Introduction

The main objective of this paper is to give a type B analogue of an elegant property of set partitions discovered by Bernhart [\cite=Ber99], that is, the number sn of partitions of [formula] without singletons is equal to the number an of partitions of

[formula]

. As noted by Bernhart, there may be no simple way to bring the set of partitions of

[formula]

without adjacencies into a one-to-one correspondence.

From a different perspective, Callan [\cite=Cal05] found a bijection in terms of an algorithm that interchanges singletons and adjacencies. In fact, Callan has established a stronger statement that the joint distribution of the number of singletons and the number of adjacencies is symmetric over the set of partitions of

[formula]

without singletons equals the number of noncrossing partitions of

[formula]

without visible singletons and showed that such partitions are enumerated by the Fine number. Here a visible singleton of a partition means a singleton not covered by any arc in the linear representation. Canfield [\cite=Can95] has shown that the average number of singletons in a partition of

[formula]

containing a given number of blocks but no singletons. Knuth [\cite=Knu05] proposed the problem of finding the generating function for the number of partitions of

The peeling and patching algorithm

In this section, we give a type B analogue of Callan's symmetric distribution of singletons and adjacencies. Moreover, the algorithm of Callan can be extended to the type B case. This type B algorithm will be called the peeling and patching algorithm.

A partition of type Bn is a partition π of the set [formula] such that for any block B of π, - B is also a block of π, and there is at most one block B, called zero-block, satisfying B =  - B, see Reiner [\cite=Rei97]. We call ±  i a singleton pair of π if π contains a block {i}, and call ±  (j,  j + 1) an adjacency pair of π if j and j + 1 (modulo n) lie in the same block of π. Denote the number of singleton pairs (resp. adjacency pairs) of π by sπ (resp. aπ). For example, let

[formula]

Then have sπ = 2 and aπ = 3.

Denote by Vn the set of Bn-partitions without zero-block. The following is the main result of this paper.

The joint distribution of the number of singleton pairs and the number of adjacency pairs is symmetric over Bn-partitions without zero-block. In other words, let

[formula]

we have Pn(x,y) = Pn(y,x).

For example, there are three B2-partitions without zero-block:

[formula]

So P2(x,y) = x2 + y2 + 1. Moreover,

[formula]

It should be noted that Theorem [\ref=thm_Callan_B] cannot be deduced from Callan's result for ordinary partitions. The following consequence is immediate, which is a type B analogue of Bernhart's observation.

The number of Bn-partitions without zero-block and singleton pairs equals the number of Bn-partitions without zero-block and adjacency pairs.

To prove Theorem [\ref=thm_Callan_B], we shall provide an algorithm [formula], called the peeling and patching algorithm, such that for any Bn-partition π without zero-block, sπ = aψ(π) and aπ = sψ(π).

In fact, we need a more general setting to describe the algorithm. Let [formula] be a subset of

[formula]

From bijection to involution

The bijection given in the previous section is not an involution although it interchanges the number of singleton pairs and the number of adjacency pairs. In this section, we show that the peeling and patching algorithm can be turned into an involution. Such an involution for ordinary partitions has been given by Callan [\cite=Cal05].

For any i∈[n], we define the complement of i to be n + 1 - i, and the complement of - i as - (n + 1 - i). This notion can be extended naturally to any symmetric partition π of
