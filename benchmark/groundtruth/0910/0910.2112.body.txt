Key Words: Heavy baryons; Light-cone QCD sum rules

Introduction

The charm and bottom baryons which contain a heavy quark and two light quarks are particularly interesting for studying dynamics of the light quarks in the presence of a heavy quark. They serve as an excellent ground for testing predictions of the quark models and heavy quark symmetry [\cite=ReviewH1] [\cite=ReviewH2]. The three light quarks form an SU(3) flavor triplet [formula], two light quarks can form diquarks of a symmetric sextet and an antisymmetric antitriplet, i.e. [formula]. For the S-wave charm baryons, the [formula] antitriplet states (Λ+c, Ξ+c,Ξ0c), and the [formula] and [formula] sextet states (Ωc,Σc,Ξ'c) and (Ω*c,Σ*c,Ξ*c) have been well established; while the corresponding bottom baryons are far from complete, only the Λb, Σb, Σ*b, Ξb, Ωb have been observed [\cite=PDG]. Furthermore, several new excited charm baryon states have been observed by the BaBar, Belle and CLEO Collaborations, such as Λc(2765)+, Λ+c(2880), Λ+c(2940), Σ+c(2800), Ξ+c(2980), Ξ+c(3077), Ξ0c(2980) , Ξ0c(3077) [\cite=ShortRV1] [\cite=ShortRV2] [\cite=ShortRV3].

In Ref.[\cite=WangVMD], we assume the charm mesons Ds0(2317) and Ds1(2460) with the spin-parity 0+ and 1+ respectively are the conventional cs̄ states, and calculate the strong coupling constants 〈D*sφ|Ds0〉 and〈Dsφ|Ds1〉 with the light-cone QCD sum rules, then take the vector meson dominance of the intermediate φ(1020), study the radiative decays Ds0  →  D*sγ and Ds1  →  Dsγ. In Refs.[\cite=Wang0809Omega] [\cite=Wang0704], we calculate the masses and the pole residues of the [formula] heavy baryons ΩQ and the [formula] heavy baryons Ω*Q with the QCD sum rules. Moreover, we study the vertexes Ω*QΩQφ with the light-cone QCD sum rules, then assume the vector meson dominance of the intermediate φ(1020), and calculate the radiative decays Ω*Q  →  ΩQγ [\cite=Wang0909].

In this article, we extend our previous works to study the vertexes Ξ*QΞ'QV and Σ*QΣQV with the light-cone QCD sum rules , then assume the vector meson dominance of the intermediate φ(1020), ρ(770) and ω(782), and calculate the radiative decays Ξ*Q  →  Ξ'Qγ and Σ*Q  →  ΣQγ to complete our works on radiative decays among the [formula] and [formula] sextet states (ΩQ,ΣQ,Ξ'Q) and (Ω*Q,Σ*Q,Ξ*Q). In Ref.[\cite=Aliev0901], Aliev et al study the radiative decays Σ*Q  →  ΣQγ, Ξ*Q  →  ΞQγ and Σ*Q  →  ΛQγ with the light-cone QCD sum rules, where the light-cone distribution amplitudes of the photon are used.

The light-cone QCD sum rules carry out the operator product expansion near the light-cone x2  ≈  0 instead of the short distance x  ≈  0, while the nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements are parameterized by the light-cone distribution amplitudes instead of the vacuum condensates [\cite=LCSR89] [\cite=LCSR] [\cite=LCSRreview]. The nonperturbative parameters in the light-cone distribution amplitudes are calculated with the conventional QCD sum rules and the values are universal. Based on the quark-hadron duality, we can obtain copious information about the hadronic parameters at the phenomenological side [\cite=LCSRreview] [\cite=SVZ79] [\cite=PRT85]. The ρNN, ρΣΣ, ρΞΞ and other strong coupling constants of the nonet vector mesons with the octet baryons have been calculated using the light-cone QCD sum rules [\cite=Zhu99] [\cite=Wang0701] [\cite=Aliev0905]. In Refs.[\cite=Aliev2006] [\cite=Aliev0908], Aliev et al study the strong coupling constants of the pseudoscalar octet mesons with the octet (decuplet) baryons comprehensively. In Refs.[\cite=Wang0707] [\cite=Wang0809], we study the strong decays Δ+  +  →  pπ, Σ*  →  Σπ and Σ*  →  Λπ using the light-cone QCD sum rules. Moreover, the coupling constants of the vector mesons ρ and ω with the baryons are studied with the external field QCD sum rules [\cite=Erkol2006]. Recently, the strong coupling constants among the light vector mesons and the heavy baryons are calculated with the light-cone QCD sum rule in the leading order of heavy quark effective theory [\cite=Zhu0909].

The article is arranged as follows: we derive the strong coupling constants g1, g2 and g3 of the vertexes B*QBQV with the light-cone QCD sum rules in Sect.2; in Sect.3, we present the numerical results and discussions; and Sect.4 is reserved for our conclusions.

The vertexes B*QBQV with light-cone QCD sum rules

We parameterize the vertexes B*QBQφ, B*QBQρ and B*QBQω with three tensor structures due to Lorentz invariance and introduce three strong coupling constants g1, g2 and g3 [\cite=ANN1973],

[formula]

where the U(p) and Uμ(p) are the Dirac spinors of the heavy baryon states BQ (Ξ'Q, ΣQ) and B*Q (Ξ*Q, Σ*Q) respectively, the εμ is the polarization vector of the mesons φ(1020), ρ(770) and ω(782), and [formula].

In the following, we write down the two-point correlation functions Πμ(p,q),

[formula]

where Q = c,b and q,q' = u,d, the i,j,k are color indexes, the Ioffe type heavy baryon currents J(x) (JΞ(x), JΣ(x)) and Jμ(x) (JΞμ(x), JΣμ(x)) interpolate the [formula] baryon states Ξ'Q, ΣQ and the [formula] baryon states Ξ*Q, Σ*Q, respectively, the external vector states φ(1020) and ρ(770) have the four momentum qμ with q2 = M2φ  /  ρ. The quark constituents of the vector mesons ρ0 and ω are [formula] and [formula] respectively, the isospin triplet meson ρ0 and isospin singlet meson ω have approximately degenerate masses. We assume that the vector mesons ρ0 and ω have similar light-cone distribution amplitudes, and obtain the corresponding strong coupling constants by symmetry considerations, as the ω-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes have not been explored yet, see Appendix A for detailed discussions.

Basing on the quark-hadron duality [\cite=SVZ79] [\cite=PRT85], we can insert a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators J(x) and Jμ(x) into the correlation functions Πμ(p,q) to obtain the hadronic representation. After isolating the ground state contributions from the pole terms of the heavy baryons Ξ'Q, ΣQ and Ξ*Q, Σ*Q, we get the following results,

[formula]

where the following definitions have been used,

[formula]

the factors 1 and [formula] correspond to the correlation functions Πφμ(p,q) and Πρ0μ(p,q) respectively. The current Jμ(x) couples not only to the spin-parity [formula] states, but also to the spin-parity [formula] states. For a generic [formula] resonance [formula], [formula], where λ* is the pole residue, M* is the mass, and the spinor U*(p,s) satisfies the usual Dirac equation [formula]. In this article, we choose the tensor structures [formula], [formula] and [formula], the baryon state [formula] has no contamination, for example, we can study the contribution of the [formula] baryon state [formula] to the correlation functions Πφμ(p,q),

[formula]

where we introduce the strong coupling constants gV and gT to parameterize the vertexes [formula], the notations f1 and f2 are functions of γα, γ5, εα, pα and qα, here we order the Dirac matrixes as [formula].

In the following, we briefly outline the operator product expansion for the correlation functions Πμ(p,q) in perturbative QCD. The calculations are performed at the large space-like momentum regions (q + p)2  ≪  0 and p2  ≪  0, which correspond to the small light-cone distance x2  ≈  0 required by the validity of the operator product expansion approach. We write down the "full" propagator of a massive quark in the presence of the quark and gluon condensates firstly [\cite=LCSR89] [\cite=PRT85],

[formula]

where 〈s̄gsσGs〉  =  〈s̄gsσαβGαβs〉 and [formula] (the corresponding full propagators Uij(x) and Dij(x) of the quarks u and d respectively can be obtained with a simple replacement), then contract the quark fields in the correlation functions Πμ(p,q) with Wick theorem, and obtain the following results:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

here we take isospin limit for the quarks u and d, the symmetry factor A = 1, ϖ =  - 1 for the channels Σ*(Qud)Σ(Qud)ρ, and [formula] and ϖ = 1 for the channels Σ*(Quu)Σ(Quu)ρ and Σ*(Qdd)Σ(Qdd)ρ respectively.

Performing the Fierz re-ordering to extract the contributions from the two-particle and three-particle vector meson light-cone distribution amplitudes respectively, then substituting the full q and Q quark propagators into the correlation functions in Eqs.(9-11) and completing the integral in the coordinate space, finally integrating over the variable k, we can obtain the correlation functions Πμ(p,q) at the level of quark-gluon degree of freedom. In calculation, the two-particle and three-particle vector meson light-cone distribution amplitudes have been used [\cite=VMLC981] [\cite=VMLC982] [\cite=VMLC2003] [\cite=VMLC2007]. The parameters in the light-cone distribution amplitudes are scale dependent and are estimated with the QCD sum rules [\cite=VMLC2003] [\cite=VMLC2007]. In this article, the energy scale μ is chosen to be μ = 1  .

Taking double Borel transform with respect to the variables Q21 =  - p2 and Q22 =  - (p + q)2 respectively, then subtracting the contributions from the high resonances and continuum states by introducing the threshold parameter s0 (i.e. [formula]), finally we can obtain 30 sum rules for the strong coupling constants g1, g2 and [formula] respectively, the explicit expressions are presented in the appendix A.

Numerical result and discussion

The masses of the established hadrons are taken from the Particle Data Group Mφ = 1.019455  , Mρ = 0.77549  , Mω = 0.78265  , MΞ*c = 2.6459  , MΣ*  +  +c = 2.5184  , MΣ*  +c = 2.5175  , MΣ* 0c = 2.5180  , MΣ*  +b = 5.8290  , MΣ*  -b = 5.8364  , MΞ'+c = 2.5756  , MΞ'0c = 2.5779  , MΣ+  +c = 2.45402  , MΣ+c = 2.4529  , MΣ0c = 2.45376  , MΣ+b = 5.8078  , and MΣ-b = 5.8152   [\cite=PDG]. In calculation, we take the average values of the masses in each isospin multiplet and neglect the small isospin splitting in the heavy baryon multiplet.

The parameters which determine the vector meson light-cone distribution amplitudes are [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] for the φ-meson; and [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] for the ρ-meson at the energy scale μ = 1   [\cite=VMLC2003] [\cite=VMLC2007].

The QCD input parameters are taken to be the standard values ms = (140  ±  10)  , mc = (1.35  ±  0.10)  , mb = (4.7  ±  0.1)  , 〈q〉 =  - (0.24  ±  0.01  )3, 〈s̄s〉 = (0.8  ±  0.2)〈q〉, 〈s̄gsσGs〉 = m20〈s̄s〉, 〈gsσGq〉 = m20〈q〉, m20 = (0.8  ±  0.2)  2, and [formula] at the energy scale μ = 1   [\cite=SVZ79] [\cite=PRT85] [\cite=Ioffe2005].

The bottom baryon states Ξ*b and Ξ'b have not been observed yet, we study their masses with the conventional QCD sum rules. The masses MBQ and MB*Q and pole residues λBQ and λB*Q are determined by the following correlation functions,

[formula]

In Refs.[\cite=Huang08] [\cite=Narison09], the masses of the heavy baryon states containing one heavy quark are studied using the QCD sum rules, the pole residues are not calculated. In this article, we take the simple Ioffe type interpolating currents, which are constructed by considering the diquark theory and the heavy quark symmetry [\cite=Jaffe2003] [\cite=Jaffe2004]. We insert a complete set of intermediate baryon states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators J(x) and Jμ into the correlation functions Π(p) and Πμν(p) to obtain the hadronic representation [\cite=SVZ79] [\cite=PRT85]. After isolating the pole terms of the lowest states Ξ*Q, Ξ'Q, Σ*Q and ΣQ, we obtain the following results:

[formula]

we choose the tensor structures gμν, [formula], 1 and [formula] for analysis. After performing the standard procedure of the QCD sum rules, we obtain sixteen sum rules for the heavy baryons states B*Q and BQ,

[formula]

where the i denote the channels Ξ*Q, Ξ'Q, Σ*Q and ΣQ respectively; the s0i are the corresponding continuum threshold parameters and the M2 is the Borel parameter. The thresholds Δi can be sorted into two sets, we introduce the q, qs̄ to denote the light quark constituents in the heavy baryon states to simplify the notations, Δq = m2Q, Δqs̄ = (mQ + ms)2. The explicit expressions of the spectral densities ρAi(s) and ρBi(s) are given in the appendix B.

Differentiate the Eq.(16) with respect to [formula], then eliminate the pole residues λi, we can obtain the sixteen sum rules for the masses of the heavy baryon states B*Q and BQ,

[formula]

In the conventional QCD sum rules [\cite=SVZ79] [\cite=PRT85], there are two criteria (pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion) for choosing the Borel parameter M2 and threshold parameter s0. We impose the two criteria on the heavy baryon states to choose the Borel parameter M2 and threshold parameter s0, the values are shown in Table 1. Finally we obtain the values of the masses and pole resides of the heavy baryon states B*Q and BQ, which are shown in Table 2.

From Table 2, we can see that the average values of the masses with the tensor structures [formula] ([formula]) and gμν (1) can reproduce the experimental data approximately for the established heavy baryon states. So it is reasonable to take the average values MΞ*b = 5.98   and MΞ'b = 5.95   for the un-established bottom baryon states Ξ*b and Ξ'b in numerical analysis. The values of the pole residues from different tensor structures differ greatly from each other in some channels, for example, Ξb', Σb, Ξc', Σc. In this article, we take the average values and assume uniform uncertainties (about 20%) for the pole residues in all channels, the uncertainties originate from the parameters other than the Borel parameter M2 are about 20%, we subtract the uncertainties originate from the Borel parameter from the total uncertainties to avoid double counting. The values of the pole residues are [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. The threshold parameters are taken as [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] in the channels Ξ*c(Ξ'c), Σ*c(Σc), Ξ*b(Ξ'b) and Σ*b(Σb) respectively; the Borel parameters are taken as M2 = (2.0 - 3.0)   and (5.0 - 6.0)   in the charm and bottom channels respectively. Those parameters are determined by the two-point QCD sum rules to avoid possible contaminations from the high resonances and continuum states. In calculation, we observe that the values of the strong coupling constants g1, g2 and G3 are insensitive to threshold parameters s0.

The main uncertainties originate from the parameters λBQ, λB*Q (as the strong coupling constants g1, g2 and G3 [formula]) and mQ, the variations of those parameters can lead to relatively large changes for the numerical values, and almost saturate the total uncertainties, i.e. the variations of the two hadronic parameters λBQ and λB*Q lead to an uncertainty about [formula], and the variations of the mQ lead to an uncertainty about (10 - 20)%, refining those parameters is of great importance. In the case of the sum rules for the strong coupling constants g2, the values are not stable enough with variations of the Borel parameter, additional uncertainties are introduced, the total uncertainties are very large, see Table 3. The contributions from the strong coupling constants g2 to the radiative decay widths are very small comparing with the corresponding ones from the g1, the predictions are insensitive to the Borel parameter. Although there are many parameters in the light-cone distributions amplitudes [\cite=VMLC2003] [\cite=VMLC2007], the uncertainties originate from those parameters are rather small. In calculation, we neglect the contributions from the high dimension vacuum condensates, such as 〈fabcGaGbGc〉, [formula], [formula], etc. They are greatly suppressed by the large numerical denominators and additional inverse powers of the Borel parameter [formula], and would not play any significant roles. Furthermore, we neglect some terms involving the light-cone distributions amplitudes [formula] and [formula] in case of the contributions from the terms f(ū0) are small, as

[formula]

Taking into account all the uncertainties of the revelent parameters, finally we obtain the numerical results of the strong coupling constants g1, g2 and 3, which are shown in the Table 3. We estimate the uncertainties δ with the formula [formula], where the f denote strong coupling constants g1, g2 and 3, the xi denote the revelent parameters mQ, 〈q〉, 〈s̄s〉, [formula]. In the numerical calculations, we take the approximation [formula] for simplicity. For the central values of the strong coupling constants, [formula], [formula], the heavy quark symmetry works rather well. Those strong coupling constants in the vertexes B*QVQV are basic parameters in describing the interactions among the heavy baryon states, once reasonable values are obtained, we can use them to perform phenomenological analysis.

The radiative decays B*Q  →  BQγ can be described by the following electromagnetic lagrangian L,

[formula]

where the Aμ is the electromagnetic field. From the lagrangian L, we can obtain the decay amplitudes with the assumption of the vector meson dominance, eT = 〈BQ(p)γ(q)|L|B*Q(p + q)〉,

[formula]

where the ημ is the polarization vector of the photon. In the heavy quark limit, the matrix elements [formula], and can be neglected, so we consider only the contributions from the intermediate vector mesons φ(1020), ρ0(770) and ω(782). The photon can be viewed as emitted from the light diquark system while the heavy quark is unaffected by the emission process.

From the strong coupling constants g1 and g2, we can obtain the decay widths ΓB*Q  →  BQγ,

[formula]

the numerical values are shown in Table 4.

There have been many works focusing on the radiative decays of the [formula] and [formula] heavy baryon sextets B*6 and B6 to the [formula] heavy baryon antitriplet [formula], [formula] and [formula], such as the light-cone QCD sum rules [\cite=Aliev0901], the heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory [\cite=HHCPT-1] [\cite=HHCPT-2], the combination of the heavy quark symmetry and the light diquark SU(2Nf)  ×  O(3) symmetry [\cite=Heavy-Light], the relativistic three-quark model [\cite=R3QM-1] [\cite=R3QM-2], etc. The works on the radiative decays B*6  →  B6  γ are very few, some decay channels are studied in the constituent quark model [\cite=CQMwidth] and the non-relativistic potential model [\cite=Dey1994]. Combining with our previous work on the radiative decays Ω*Q  →  ΩQ  γ [\cite=Wang0909], we perform systematic studies for the radiative decays B*6  →  B6  γ with the light-cone QCD sum rules. The strong decays B*6  →  B6  π are forbidden due to the unavailable phase space, while the radiative channels are not phase space suppressed and become relevant, although the electromagnetic strength is weaker than that of the strong interaction. The properties of the charm baryon states would be studied at the BESIII and [formula] [\cite=BESIII] [\cite=PANDA], where the charm baryon states are copiously produced at the e+e- and p collisions. The LHCb is a dedicated b and c-physics precision experiment at the LHC (large hadron collider). The LHC will be the world's most copious source of the b hadrons, and a complete spectrum of the b hadrons will be available through gluon fusion. In proton-proton collisions at [formula], the b cross section is expected to be ~  500μb producing 1012 b pairs in a standard year of running at the LHCb operational luminosity of [formula] [\cite=LHC]. The present predictions for the radiative decays can be tested at the BESIII, [formula] and LHCb.

Conclusion

In this article, we parameterize the vertexes B*QBQV with three tensor structures due to Lorentz invariance, study the corresponding three strong coupling constants with the light-cone QCD sum rules, then assume the vector meson dominance of the intermediate φ(1020), ρ0(770) and ω(782) as the contributions from the J / ψ and Υ are negligible in the heavy quark limit, and calculate the radiative decay widths ΓB*Q  →  BQγ. The predictions can be tested by the experimental data at the BESIII, [formula] and LHCb in the future. Although the values of the strong coupling constants g2 are not stable enough with variations of the Borel parameter, the Borel parameter dependence of the radiative decay widths is very weak, as the main contributions come from the strong coupling constants g1. The heavy quark symmetry works rather well for the strong coupling constants g1 and [formula]. The strong coupling constants in the vertexes B*QBQV are basic parameters in describing the interactions among the heavy baryon states, once reasonable values are obtained, we can use them to perform phenomenological analysis.

The strong coupling constants g1, g2 and G3 in the vertexes Σ*  +cΣ+cρ0 and Σ* 0bΣ0bρ0 vanish in the isospin symmetry limit. For some technical details involving the three particle vector-mesons (φ and ρ0) light-cone distribution amplitudes, one can consult Ref.[\cite=WangJPG].

The quark constituents of the vector mesons ρ0 and ω are [formula] and [formula] respectively. For example, the correlation functions ΠΞ+  *cΞ'+cρ  /  ωμ(p,q) and ΠΞ0 *cΞ'0cρ  /  ωμ(p,q) can be decomposed as

Such an approximation is not crude, for example, if we study the masses and decay constants of the vector mesons ρ0 and ω using the interpolating currents [formula] and [formula] respectively with the QCD sum rules, the resulting values are almost degenerate.
