Suppression of electron correlations in the superconducting alloys of Rh17 - xIrxS15

Introduction

Superconductivity in the mineral (Miassite) Rh17S15 (cubic, Pm3m) was shown to arise due to strong electron correlations (presumably due to the high density of Rh-4d states at the Fermi level) from magnetic, thermal and transport studies in a well characterized polycrystalline sample (with Tc  ≈   5.4 K) by some of us recently [\cite=r1]. This is now confirmed by the single crystal studies of Settai et al [\cite=r2]. A vortex phase diagram in the same sample has also been established [\cite=r3] via exploration of the anomalous variations in critical current density (Jc(H,T)) extracted from ac and dc magnetization measurements. The dc magnetization hysteresis loops show the presence of a very broad fishtail with unresolved structure commencing deep inside the mixed state and lasting upto the upper critical field Hc2. Similar behavior is also observed in a high quality single crystal grown by us. The observation of T2 dependence of resistivity, enhanced susceptibility, moderate Sommerfeld coefficient (γ), large value of the upper critical field and large heat capacity jump (ΔC /γTC  =  2) suggest that Rh17S15 is a strongly correlated system. This conjecture is further substantiated by the estimated value of 2 for Wilson's coefficient (π2 ~ k2B  ~  χ(0) / 3μ2B  ~  γ) and 5 x 10- 5 for the Kadawaki-Woods ratio (A/γ2). One way to achieve a moderate density of low-energy fermionic excitations (as seen by the appreciable value of γ) is from the large density of states of the narrow 4d band of Rh at the Fermi level [\cite=r4]. This is supported by the structure since some of the Rh-Rh distances are smaller than those that exist in the pure Rh metal. In order to understand the strongly correlated superconductivity in Rh17S15, we have studied the effect of Ir substitution for Rh in this compound.

The Samples

The samples were prepared by reacting Rh powder (99.9% pure) and Ir powder (99.9% pure) with Sulphur powder (99.999% pure) by the same method as described in [\cite=r1]. Powder X-ray diffraction confirmed the cubic structure. The lattice constant of pure Rh17S15 was found to be 0.99093(2) nm [\cite=r1] while for Ir substituted samples, the lattice constants are estimated to be 0.99144(3) nm and 0.99183(3) nm from a Rietveld analysis. Clearly, Ir substitution leads to the expansion of the lattice of Rh17S15. The EPMA measurements indicate that the doped samples had a small distribution of dopant concentrations. On an average Ir1Rh16S15 contains around 3 atomic percent of Ir and Ir2 Rh15S15 around 6 atomic percent of Ir which are about the values we expect from our mixture stoichiometry. Since Rh exists in four different crystallographic sites in Rh17S15 [\cite=r1] we cannot find out, from these preliminary measurements, which Rh atom is being substituted by Ir.

Results and Discussion

Fig. [\ref=rho] shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for pure Rh17S15 and those of Ir substituted samples measured in a home made dc resistivity setup at zero field. Unlike the monotonically decreasing resistivity (ρ(T)) with the decrease in temperature in pure Rh17S15, the ρ(T) of Ir substituted samples shows a well resolved shallow minimum before the superconducting transition. The position of the minimum is at around 35 K for both the doped samples. There is no appreciable change in the temperature of the minima upto magnetic fields of 5 T. The origin of the minima is not understood at the moment. However, it could be related to the weak localization effects which could arise due to the presence of disorder in the doped samples as evidenced by the increase in their resistivity values. In fact, the ratio of resistivities of doped to undoped increases from around 1.6 at room temperature to around 8 at 10 K. Fig. [\ref=shc] shows a plot of Cp/T versus T2 for the undoped and doped samples at zero field from 2K to 10K. These measurements were done on a commercial Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design, USA). Fits to the equation Cp/T = γ + βT2 are also shown in the same figures where γ is the electronic contribution and β is the lattice contribution. Thus estimated γ values in IrxRh17 - xS15 show a decrease with increase in x from around 105 mJ/mol-K2 for x = 0 to around 80 mJ/mol-K2 for x = 2 (actual values are tabulated later). This clearly indicates a substantial reduction of density of states at Fermi level and hence of electron correlations with increase in doping. From the β values one can estimate the Debye temperature θD from

[formula]

where N is the Avogadro Number, r is the number of atoms per formula unit and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The Debye temperature decreases from 424K to 327K as x increases from 0 to 2 indicating a softening of the lattice with doping. The temperature dependence of the susceptibility (χ(T)) in a field of 3 T, as measured by a commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design, USA) of Ir doped samples is shown in Fig. [\ref=sus1] as contrasted with that of pure Rh17S15. Since none of Rh, S or Ir carry a magnetic moment we expect to see a temperature independent susceptibility (essentially Pauli susceptibility) in our samples. However, although the values of χ(T) are small, the data display a distinct temperature dependence similar to that seen in pure Rh17S15 [\cite=r1]. There is a gradual increase in susceptibility as one goes to lower temperatures until the superconducting transition. The weak temperature dependence of χ(T) could arise due to a sharp density of states at the Fermi level and we speculate that the mechanism is similar to that in V3Si [\cite=r5]. This conjecture is recently supported by the observation of temperature dependent Knight shift from the 103Rh-NMR experiment [\cite=r6]. In fact, the values of susceptibility per Rhodium atom in pure Rh17S15 are of the same order as that of susceptibility per Vanadium atom in V3Si [\cite=r5] near the transition. The inset shows the variation of χ(300 K) as a function of x in Rh17 - xIrxS15. The susceptibility values at room temperature reduce by more than an order of magnitude from undoped sample to Ir2Rh15S15 (actual values are tabulated later). This can be attributed to a reduced density of states at the Fermi level and supports our deduction from the Cp data discussed earlier.

Fig. [\ref=fish] displays what is termed as the "fishtail effect" in the isothermal scan of magnetization as a function of field for Rh17 - xIrxS15 samples. It refers to a non-monotonic dependence of the width of the magnetic hysteresis loop on the magnitude of the external magnetic field. The fishtail effect (FE) or ��second magnetization peak anomaly�� found in magnetization loops is one of the still puzzling properties observed only in bulk samples, either homogeneous or granular, of single or polycrystals of high-Tc as well as low-Tc superconductors. Although this phenomenon has been studied intensively in recent years (see, for example, Refs. [\cite=r7]-[\cite=r11] and references cited therein), there is still no general agreement about its origin. Mainly two approaches are used to explain this phenomenon. In the first one, the fishtail effect is regarded as a manifestation of a non-monotonic dependence of Jc on B, where Jc is the critical current density, determined in neglect of relaxation processes, and B is the magnetic induction. This approach has been used to discuss different mechanisms that could result in such a dependence Jc on B (see, for example, Refs. [\cite=r7]-[\cite=r11]). In another approach, magnetic relaxation, which causes the currents circulating in the sample to decrease below their critical value, plays the main role in explaining the unusual form of the magnetic hysteresis loop. In this case the fishtail effect is attributed to the non-monotonic H dependence of the rate of magnetic relaxation. From Fig. [\ref=fish] one can see that the width of the fishtail decreases as a function of x suggesting that the increased disorder due to Ir substitution leads to this suppression.

Finally, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (Hc2) is shown in the Fig. [\ref=hc2]. These Hc2 values were estimated from susceptibility and magnetisation measurements. It is interesting to note that the value of Hc2 decreases rapidly with the substitution of Ir for Rh in Rh17 - xIrxS15. The reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level (as supported by other bulk measurements) seems to reduce the upper critical field values when Rh is substituted by Ir.

Conclusion

Table 1 shows the values of various estimated parameters in the doped and undoped samples. Earlier, [\cite=r1], we have conjectured that the electron correlations in Rh17S15 could be due to a high density of states of Rh-4d band at Fermi level arising due to strong Rh-Rh interactions. After Ir doping there is a lattice expansion as revealed by the X-ray data and hence an increase of Rh-Rh distances in the compound which could affect the interaction between Rh atoms. This seems to lead to a decrease of density of states at Fermi level as supported by the reduction in the susceptibility and the γ values. The drastic decrease in Hc2 could also be due to the same reason. Increase in Ir substitution also increases the level of disorder in the system and this seems to strongly increase the pinning in the system as revealed by the strong suppression of fishtail.
