Inversion of series and the cohomology of the moduli spaces Mδ0,n.

Introduction

For n  ≥  3, let M0,n be the moduli space, defined over [formula], of smooth n-pointed curves of genus zero, and let [formula] denote its smooth compactification, due to Deligne-Mumford and Knudsen. In [\cite=Br], an intermediary space Mδ0,n, which satisfies

[formula]

was defined in terms of explicit polynomial equations. It is a smooth affine scheme over [formula]. The automorphism group of M0,n is the symmetric group [formula] permuting the n marked points, and this gives rise to a decomposition (see [\cite=Br]),

[formula]

Thus Mδ0,n defines a symmetric set of canonical affine charts for [formula].

In this note, we compute the dimensions

[formula]

of the de Rham cohomology of Mδ0,n for all i and n. Our main result can be expressed in terms of generating series, as follows. If X is a smooth scheme over [formula] of dimension d, we will denote its Euler characteristic (or rather, Poincaré polynomial) by:

[formula]

Consider the exponential generating series:

[formula]

The following formula is due to Ginzburg-Kapranov ([\cite=GK], theorem 3.3.2) and Getzler ([\cite=Ge], .8)

[formula]

In this paper, we will consider the ordinary generating series:

[formula]

The following inversion formula holds:

[formula]

Using the well-known formula

[formula]

and the purity of Mδ0,n  +  1, we deduce a recurrence relation for e(Mδ0,n  +  1) from (), and hence also for the Betti numbers an,i. The proof of equation () uses the fact that the coefficients in the Lagrange inversion formula are precisely given by the combinatorics of Stasheff polytopes, which in turn determine the structure of the mixed Tate motive underlying Mδ0,n.

In the special case q = 0, the series f(x) reduces to [formula], which is essentially the generating series for the operad [formula]. Comparing equation [\eqref=mainid] to Lemma 8 in [\cite=ST] we find that the dimensions [formula] are precisely the numbers of prime generators for [formula]. We expect that there should be an explicit bijection between [formula] and the set of prime generators described in the proof of Proposition 6 in [\cite=ST], and, more generally, an operad-theoretic interpretation of equation [\eqref=mainid] for all q.

This work was begun at Institut Mittag-Leffler, Sweden, during the year 2006-2007 on moduli spaces. We thank the institute for the hospitality.

Geometry of Mδ0,n

We recall some geometric properties of Mδ0,n from [\cite=Br]. The set of real points [formula] is not connected but has n! / 2n components, and they can be indexed by the set of dihedral structures δ on the set [formula]. Let Xδ denote one such connected component. Its closure in the real moduli space

[formula]

is a compact manifold with corners. The variety [formula] is then defined to be the complement [formula], where Aδ is the set of all irreducible divisors [formula] which do not meet the closed cell [formula]. Conversely, every irreducible divisor [formula] which does meet the closed cell [formula], defines an irreducible divisor [formula]. In the case n = 4, we have:

[formula]

where Xδ is the open interval (0,1) and [formula] is the closed interval

Purity

Since Mδ0,n is stratified by products of varieties M0,r, which are isomorphic to an affine complement of hyperplanes and therefore of Tate type, it follows that Hi(Mδ0,n) defines an element in the category of mixed Tate motives over [formula]. In fact, it was proved in [\cite=Br] that Mδ0,n is smooth and affine, so it follows by a theorem due to Grothendieck that its cohomology is generated by global regular forms. Using the well-known fact that Hi(M0,n) is pure [\cite=Ge], it follows that the subspace Hi(Mδ0,n) is also pure. We can therefore work inside the semisimple subcategory (or Grothendieck group) generated by pure Tate motives. We have that,

[formula]

The purity of the spaces Mδ0,n has the important consequence that we have an equality of Poincaré polynomials (i.e. not only of Euler characteristics),

[formula]

Decompositions of regular n-gons

If λ is a partition of a number, we define λi to be the number of times i appears in this partition. For each partition λ of n - 2, we then define P(λ) to be the number of choices of [formula] non-intersecting chords of an n-regular polygon that gives rise, for each i, to λi subpolygons with i + 2 sides. Thus, P(λ) counts the number of decompositions of an n-gon of given combinatorial type. This number is found to be equal to (see Ex. 2.7.14 on p. 127 in [\cite=GJ]):

[formula]

Combining this result and [\eqref=EulerC] we find that,

[formula]

Using equation [\eqref=eulopen] we can now compute the an,i's for any i and n,

From Example (), we have

[formula]

which reduces to q3 + 5q - 4. In particular, [formula].

Clearly an,0 = 1 for all n, and it is also easy to see that an,1 = 0 for all n. In the following table we present the results for n from five to eleven.

There are no entries above the diagonal, because Mδ0,n is affine. For small i, one can use () to write down explicit formulae for an,i as a function of n, e.g.,

[formula]

Finally, setting q = 0 in () gives the following closed formula for the dimension an,l of the middle-dimensional de Rham cohomology of Mδ0,n, where l: = n - 3,

[formula]

An inversion formula

The proof is immediate on comparing equation [\eqref=count] with the combinatorial interpretation of Lagrange's formula for the inversion of series in one variable (see [\cite=MF], equation (4.5.12), p. 412). More precisely, consider the formal power series:

[formula]

Lagrange's formula states that the formal solution to v(u(x)) = x is given by

[formula]

where v2  =  u2, v3  =  2u22 + u3, v4 = 5u32 + 5u2u3 + u4, and in general:

[formula]

The theorem follows from () on setting ui = e(M0,i  +  1).

In the special case when q = 0, we deduce the following corollary.

The generating series for the dimensions [formula] is obtained by inverting the series

[formula]

A recurrence relation

Let us alter our series slightly and put F(x): =  - f( - x) and Fδ(x): =  - fδ( - x). By theorem [\ref=invthm] we find that Fδ(F(x)) = F(Fδ(x)) = x. The series F(x) is easily seen to satisfy the differential equation:

[formula]

By differentiating Fδ(F(x)) = x, we have Fδ'(F(x))F'(x) = 1. Substituting the previous expression for F'(x) gives:

[formula]

By changing variables y = F(x), where Fδ(y) = Fδ(F(x)) = x, we obtain:

[formula]

Expanding out gives:

[formula]

If we write

[formula]

then the coefficient of yn is exactly:

[formula]

Decomposing the first sum [formula], and using the fact that a1 = 1, gives the recurrence relation:

[formula]

The recurrence relation

[formula]

with initial conditions a0 = 0, a1 = 1, has a unique solution given by

[formula]

In the special case q = 0, we have the following corollary. Note that in theorem 9 of [\cite=ST] there is an equivalent presentation of this recurrence relation.

The dimensions [formula] are the unique solutions to the recurrence relation:

[formula]

with initial conditions b0 = 0,b1 =  - 1.

Set bn =  - an|q = 0 in the previous theorem.
