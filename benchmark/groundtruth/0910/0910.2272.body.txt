In going to the pump-probe limit of a nl-WPI experiment, the interpulse delays for pulses within a phase-related pair are set to zero. The treatment described in Paper 1 (see Eq. (13)) properly accounts for the non-negligible effects of pulse overlap that enter in this limit. We construct second-order pulse propagators for ground-state bleach (GSB), stimulated emission (SE), or excited-state absorption (ESA) depending on the particular action of the pulse (0  →  ε  →  0 , ε  →  0  →  ε , or ε  →  2  →  ε respectively).

Propagators for GSB take the form

[formula]

To calculate the matrix elements for this operator in the eigenbasis of H0, we introduce completeness relations in the eigenbasis of H1,

[formula]

A closed-form expression can be derived for nested time integrals of the form appearing in Eq. (B.2), due to the Gaussian nature of the integrand. The first step is to change the order of integration,

[formula]

We now make a change of variables, letting τ  =  τ2  -  τ1

[formula]

and then change integration order again to obtain

[formula]

The inner integral is solved in the usual way, giving

[formula]

which can be written in terms of the error function,

[formula]

We can now return to the vibronic matrix element for the GSB propagator, which by Eq. (B.7) can be written as

[formula]

Matrix elements of the operator p(01')I(  ∞  ;  t2)p(1'0)I(t2;  t1) follow analogously. A GSB propagator also describes the action of the pre-resonant control pulse, whose effect on the system is primarily the creation of a ground-state wave packet, and Eq. (15) of the main text is equivalent to Eq. (B.8).

The ESA propagators are obtained in a similar fashion,

[formula]

and the corresponding elements of p(1'2)I(  ∞  ;  t2)p(21')I(t2;  t1) follow by direct analogy. Unlike in the case of GSB, we now have the possibility that the final and initial electronic states will be different. We then need matrix elements of the form

[formula]

Finally, the SE propagators are written

[formula]

and

[formula]

For the pump-probe signal, the anisotropy is defined by

[formula]

Using well-known orientational factors1, we can write the stimulated emission component to the numerator above (assuming the monomers have orthogonal transition dipole moments) as

[formula]

In the second equality, use has been made of the fact that for equal-energy homodimers the overlaps retain their value when the labels 1 and 1' are interchanged. The denominator is

[formula]

When the interpulse delay tCA is zero, overlaps like [formula] vanish, as there is no interval of free evolution during which energy transfer can take place. This simplification gives a compact expression for the initial anisotropy

[formula]

which reduces to 0.4 or 0.7 when the ratio of wave-packet overlaps in the second term is 0 or 1, respectively. This ratio is essentially zero under the conditions of our simulations (which use a red-shifted probe pulse) due to the fact that the spatial region in which the probe pulse is resonant with the 1  →  0 transition (near qa  =  2d ) overlaps the region in which it is resonant with the 1'←0 transition (qb  =  2d ) far from the location of the wave packet created by the pump pulse. Were the pump and probe to have the same center frequency, or were the probe pulse sufficiently short that its center frequency became irrelevant, the value of rPP(0)  =  0.7 would be obtained (see Figure panel A).

The anisotropy for the pump-probe difference signal, in which the system first interacts with a vertically polarized control pulse, is given by

[formula]

Omitting those overlaps that depend on energy transfer between pulses, and again making use of the symmetry with respect to interchange of 1 and 1', we find

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the case that all of the overlaps listed in Eqs. (C.6) and (C.7) are equal in value (which happens when the pump and probe are arbitrarily short), the initial anisotropy is 0.7. Numerically, we find an initial anisotropy of 0.69 when σA and σC are set equal to one hundredth of the vibrational period for the equal-energy dimer used in Section 2A of the main text (see Figure panels B and C).

When the overlaps containing c(1'0)c(01) do not contribute, for the same reason as described above, we have

[formula]

In general, this expression gives an initial anisotropy that changes with pulse and molecular parameters, in contrast with the initial value of 0.4 often found in pump-probe experiments. Were the control pulse arbitrarily short, it would be ineffective in driving nuclear motion in the electronic ground state, and [formula] would be identical to[formula]. In this limit, Eq. (C.8) reduces to a value of [formula] for non-impulsive pump and probe pulses (see Figure panel B). That this value for an impulsive control pulse is different from 0.4 is not unexpected. The control pulse creates a copy of the ground-state nuclear wave packet only in those molecules in which one of the monomers has a nonzero transition dipole component along the V axis. It is this subset of the total isotropic population upon which a pump-probe experiment is conducted. In the situation of interest - where the control pulse does generate motion on the electronic ground state - we find no single limiting value for Eq. (C.8) (see Figure panel C).

It should be recalled that our numerical simulations explicitly ignore overlap between the pump and probe pulses, and our results are therefore only strictly valid for interpulse delays longer than the pulse lengths. Numerical calculations that rigorously include overlap between the pump and probe (not included here) show that neglecting this overlap tends to result in an overestimation of the initial anisotropy for the pump-probe difference. For example, using the same pulse and molecular parameters as in Fig. 4 of the main body of the paper and neglecting pulse overlap gives an initial anisotropy of 0.25 (which is largely unaffected by inhomogeneous broadening), whereas properly treating the effects of pulse overlap reduces this value to 0.14. Thus the "initial anisotropies" plotted as a function of pump and probe pulse duration do not strictly depict the true initial anisotropy. Nonetheless, due to the presence of a single vibrational period in our two-mode model system, they do hold significance as the anisotropy when the interpulse delay is equal to the vibrational period, if energy transfer is neglected on this time scale.
