The polynomial property (V)

Given two Banach spaces E and F, we denote by P(k E,F) the space of all k-homogeneous (continuous) polynomials from E into F, and by [formula] the subspace of polynomials which are weak-to-norm continuous on bounded sets. This subspace has been studied by many authors: see, for instance, [\cite=AHV] [\cite=AP] [\cite=FGL] [\cite=GGwb]. Clearly, every polynomial in [formula] takes bounded sets into relatively compact sets. Observe that P(1 E,F) = L(E,F), the space of (linear bounded) operators from E into F, and that [formula], the space of compact operators. The spaces P(0 E,F) and [formula] may be identified with F.

Kalton studied in [\cite=K] the structure of the space K(E,F). In the present paper, we obtain versions of his results for the space [formula], showing that [formula] contains a copy of [formula] if and only if either E contains a complemented copy of [formula] or F contains a copy of [formula]. We also prove that, for E having an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity, the following assertions are equivalent: (a) [formula]; (b) [formula] contains no copy of c0; (c) P(k E,F) contains no copy of [formula]; (d) [formula] is complemented in P(k E,F).

As an application, we prove that, if E has property (V) (the definitions are given below) and [formula], then every k-homogeneous unconditionally converging polynomial on E is weakly compact. If E has an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity, then the converse is also true.

Throughout, E and F will denote Banach spaces, BE is the closed unit ball of E and SE is the unit sphere of E; E* will be the dual of E. The set of natural numbers is denoted by . As usual, (en) stands for the unit vector basis of c0.

A formal series [formula] in E is weakly unconditionally Cauchy (w.u.C., for short) if, for every φ∈E*, we have [formula]. Equivalent definitions may be seen in [\cite=Di]. The series is unconditionally convergent if every subseries converges. Equivalent definitions may be seen in [\cite=DJT].

A polynomial P∈P(k E,F) is unconditionally converging [\cite=FU] [\cite=FUExt] if, for each w.u.C. series [formula] in E, the sequence [formula] is convergent in F. The space of all unconditionally converging polynomials is denoted by [formula]. This class has been very useful for obtaining polynomial characterizations of Banach space properties (see [\cite=GV]). We say that P∈P(k E,F) is (weakly) compact if P(BE) is relatively (weakly) compact in F. Every weakly compact polynomial is unconditionally converging. For the general theory of polynomials on Banach spaces, we refer to [\cite=Din] [\cite=Mu].

To each polynomial P∈P(k E,F) we can associate a unique symmetric k-linear mapping [formula] so that [formula] and an operator TP:E  →  P(k - 1 E,F) given by [formula]. It is well known that [formula] if and only if TP is compact [\cite=AHV].

Denote by [formula] the space of all operators C:E  →  P(k - 1 E,F) such that

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the symmetric (k - 1)-linear mapping associated to C(x).

Proof. Clearly, T is well defined, linear and injective. Since

[formula]

[\cite=Mu], we have that T is continuous. To see that it is surjective, take [formula], and define [formula] by [formula], and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Hence, TP = C. [formula]

The subspace of all operators in [formula] which are compact (resp. weakly compact) will be denoted by [formula] (resp. [formula]). Given [formula], the symmetry of C easily implies that [formula].

The proof of [\cite=AS] gives:

Proof. If [formula] contains a copy of [formula], a fortiori the space [formula] contains it. Therefore [\cite=K], either E contains a complemented copy of [formula] or [formula] contains a copy of [formula]. Repeating the process, we conclude that either E contains a complemented copy of [formula] or [formula] contains a copy of [formula].

Conversely, if F contains a copy of [formula], since [formula] is isomorphic to a subspace of [formula] (Proposition [\ref=compl]), we obtain that [formula] contains a copy of [formula]. If E contains a complemented copy of [formula], then E* contains a copy of [formula]; since [formula] is isomorphic to a subspace of [formula], which is in turn isomorphic to a subspace of [formula], we obtain that the latter contains a copy of [formula]. [formula]

The proof of [\cite=K] yields:

Assume E is separable, [formula] is complemented in P(k E,F), and an operator [formula] is given with the following properties:

(a) [formula] for all n;

(b) the subset [formula] is separable.

Then, for every infinite subset [formula], there exists an infinite subset M0  ⊆  M with [formula] for all [formula].

Suppose E contains a complemented copy of [formula]. Then [formula] is uncomplemented in P(k E,F) for every F and [formula] (k > 1).

Proof. As in [\cite=K], we can reduce the problem to the case [formula].

Fix v∈SF and define the operator

[formula]

by

[formula]

Since

[formula]

Φ is continuous (easily, it is even an isometric embedding).

We claim that [formula] if and only if ξ∈c0. Indeed, let

[formula]

be the associated operator given by

[formula]

Since, for n  ≠  m,

[formula]

we have

[formula]

it follows that TΦ(ξ) is compact if and only if ξ∈c0 (see [\cite=Di]).

By Lemma [\ref=op2linf], there is an infinite [formula] such that [formula] for all [formula], which contradicts the above claim. [formula]

In the linear case (k = 1), Kalton needs to assume that F is infinite dimensional for the validity of Lemma [\ref=uncompl] [\cite=K]. Taking k > 1, we can drop this condition. Observe that, if k = 1 and dim (F) <   ∞  , we have

[formula]

so the conclusion of the Lemma is not true.

An finite dimensional expansion of the identity for a Banach space E is a sequence of finite dimensional operators An:E  →  E such that for each x∈E,

[formula]

unconditionally. This condition is a bit more general than having an unconditional basis [\cite=JLS].

Suppose E has an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity and let P∈P(k E,F). Then there is a w.u.C. series [formula] in [formula] such that, for all x∈E, [formula] unconditionally.

Proof. There is a sequence (Ai)  ⊂  K(E,E) such that, for every x∈E, we have [formula] unconditionally. Then,

[formula]

where [formula].

Choosing finite subsets [formula] of integers, we have

[formula]

Hence, the series

[formula]

is unconditionally convergent for all x∈E [\cite=DJT]. Therefore, [formula] unconditionally.

Moreover, by the uniform boundedness principle [\cite=Mu], we have

[formula]

So [formula] is w.u.C. in [formula] [\cite=Di]. [formula]

Proof. (a) ⇒   (c): Assume [formula] contains a copy of [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=copylinf], either E contains a complemented copy of [formula] or F contains a copy of [formula]. Lemma [\ref=uncompl] implies that E contains no complemented copy of [formula], so F contains a copy of [formula]. Take a normalized basic sequence (xi)  ⊂  E and a bounded sequence of coefficient functionals (φn)  ⊂  E* (φi(xj) = δij). Define [formula] by [formula]. Then, for i  ≠  j, we have [formula]. Hence, denoting by [formula] an isomorphism, we get [formula], a contradiction.

(c) ⇒   (b): The proof is the same of the linear case [\cite=K] with slight modifications.

(b) ⇒   (a): Take P∈P(k E,F). Consider the w.u.C. series [formula] given by Lemma [\ref=sumpol] with [formula]. Since this space contains no copy of c0, the series is unconditionally convergent [\cite=Di]. Clearly, its sum must be P. Since the space [formula] is closed, we conclude that [formula].

(a) ⇒   (d) is trivial.

(d) ⇒   (a): If [formula] is complemented in P(k E,F), Lemma [\ref=uncompl] implies that E contains no complemented copy of [formula]. Suppose there is [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=sumpol], we can find a sequence [formula] so that [formula] unconditionally for each x∈E, and [formula] is w.u.C. but is not unconditionally convergent since [formula]. Hence, we can find ε > 0, and an increasing sequence (mj) of integers such that, for each j, the polynomial

[formula]

satisfies [formula].

Define now [formula] by [formula] for [formula] and x∈E. Since the series [formula] is unconditionally convergent, so is the series [formula]. The set [formula] is contained in the closed linear span of [formula] which is separable by the compactness of Cj. On the other hand, [formula] for all j. By Lemma [\ref=op2linf], there is an infinite subset [formula] such that [formula] for each [formula].

Therefore, for each [formula], the series [formula] is weak subseries convergent. The Orlicz-Pettis theorem then implies that it is unconditionally convergent. In particular,

[formula]

a contradiction. [formula]

Observe that the unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity is used only in (b) ⇒   (a) and (d) ⇒   (a).

In the linear case (k = 1), the restriction dim (F) =   ∞   is required for the validity of Theorem [\ref=Kalton] [\cite=K].

Every polynomial P∈P(k E,F) has an extension, called the Aron-Berner extension, to a polynomial [formula] (see [\cite=AB] [\cite=GGMM] [\cite=GV]). If [formula], then [formula] is weak-star continuous on bounded sets [\cite=Mo].

Recall that a Banach space has property (V), introduced in [\cite=Pe], if every unconditionally converging operator on E is weakly compact. Every C(K) space has property (V) [\cite=Pe].

We shall need the following result:

Easily, if a polynomial is weakly compact, then its Aron-Berner extension is F-valued [\cite=C].

Proof. (a) ⇒   (b): Given [formula], by Theorem [\ref=propv], the range of its Aron-Berner extension [formula] is contained in F. Take a net (xα)  ⊂  BE. We can assume that (xα) is weak Cauchy and so it converges in the weak-star topology to some z∈E*  *.

Let ψ∈F*. Then [formula] and so,

[formula]

Therefore, the net (P(xα)) is weakly convergent to [formula]. So, P(BE) is relatively weakly compact.

(b) ⇒   (a): By the comment preceding this Theorem, and by Theorem [\ref=propv], (b) implies that E has property (V). Also, every polynomial in [formula] is compact. From this, we obtain that P(k E) contains no copy of c0 [\cite=DL]. A fortiori, [formula] contains no copy of c0. Since E has an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity, we conclude from Theorem [\ref=Kalton] that [formula]. [formula]

We do not know if the condition on the existence of an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity may be removed from Theorem [\ref=polpropv]. In fact, if (b) is satisfied, since P(k - 1 E) contains no copy of c0 and E has property (V), we have

[formula]

So, we only have to show that [formula]. There are many conditions on E (apart from the existence of an unconditional finite dimensional expansion of the identity) that imply this equality [\cite=EJ] [\cite=F], and it is not known if there are Banach spaces X, Y such that K(X,Y)  ≠  W(X,Y) while K(X,Y) contains no copy of c0 [\cite=E].

Recall that the condition [formula] implies that E contains no copy of [formula] [\cite=G].

It is proved in [\cite=FU] that if [formula] and E has property (u) then, for all F, every [formula] is weakly compact. Part (a) ⇒   (b) of Theorem [\ref=polpropv] is stronger than the result of [\cite=FU]. The latter cannot be applied, for instance, to the space c0πc0 which fails property (u) [\cite=L] while it does have property (V) [\cite=EH]. For the definition of property (u) and its relationship to property (V), see [\cite=Pe]. Recall in particular that, if E has property (u) and contains no copy of [formula], then E has property (V) [\cite=Pe].
