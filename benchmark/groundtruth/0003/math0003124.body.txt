Surjective factorization of holomorphic mappings

Introduction and preliminary results

In recent years many authors [\cite=AG] [\cite=AS] [\cite=Ge] [\cite=GG] [\cite=GGiny] [\cite=Li] [\cite=Ro] [\cite=RyWCo] have studied conditions on a holomorphic mapping f between complex Banach spaces so that it may be written in the form either [formula] or [formula], where g is another holomorphic mapping and T a (linear bounded) operator belonging to certain classes of operators.

A rather thorough study of the factorization of the form [formula], where T is in a closed injective operator ideal, was carried out by the authors in [\cite=GGiny]. In the present paper we analyze the case [formula].

If [formula], with T in the ideal of compact operators, and g is holomorphic on a Banach space E then, since g is locally bounded, f will be "locally compact" in the sense that every x∈E has a neighbourhood Vx such that f(Vx) is relatively compact. It is proved in [\cite=AS] that the converse also holds: every locally compact holomorphic mapping f can be written in the form [formula], with T a compact operator. Similar results were given in [\cite=RyWCo] for the ideal of weakly compact operators, in [\cite=Li] for the Rosenthal operators, and in [\cite=Ro] for the Asplund operators. We extend this type of factorization to every closed surjective operator ideal.

Throughout, E, F and G will denote complex Banach spaces, and  will be the set of natural numbers. We use BE for the closed unit ball of E, and B(x,r) for the open ball of radius r centered at x. If A  ⊂  E, then (A) denotes the absolutely convex, closed hull of A, and if f is a mapping on E, then

[formula]

We denote by L(E,F) the space of all operators from E into F, endowed with the usual operator norm. A mapping P:E  →  F is a k-homogeneous (continuous) polynomial if there is a k-linear continuous mapping [formula] such that [formula] for all x∈E. The space of all such polynomials is denoted by P(k E,F). A mapping f:E  →  F is holomorphic if, for each x∈E, there are r > 0 and a sequence (Pk) with Pk∈P(k E,F) such that

[formula]

uniformly for [formula]. We use the notation

[formula]

while H(E,F) stands for the space of all holomorphic mappings from E into F.

We say that a subset A  ⊂  E is circled if for every x∈A and complex λ with |λ| = 1, we have λx∈A.

For a general introduction to polynomials and holomorphic mappings, the reader is referred to [\cite=Di] [\cite=Mu] [\cite=Na]. The definition and general properties of operator ideals may be seen in [\cite=Pi].

An operator ideal U is said to be injective [\cite=Pi] if, given an operator T∈L(E,F) and an injective isomorphism i:F  →  G, we have that T∈U whenever iT∈U. The ideal U is surjective [\cite=Pi] if, given T∈L(E,F) and a surjective operator q:G  →  E, we have that T∈U whenever Tq∈U. We say that U is closed [\cite=Pi] if for all E and F, the space U(E,F): = {T∈L(E,F):T∈U} is closed in L(E,F).

Given an operator T∈L(E,F), a procedure is described in [\cite=DFJP] to construct a Banach space Y and operators k∈L(E,Y) and j∈L(Y,F) so that T = jk. We shall refer to this construction as the DFJP factorization. It is shown in [\cite=H] (see also [\cite=Go] for simple statement and proof) that given an operator T∈L(E,F) and a closed operator ideal U,

(a) if U is injective and T∈U, then k∈U;

(b) if U is surjective and T∈U, then j∈U. We say that U is factorizable if, for every T∈U(E,F), there are a Banach space Y and operators k∈L(E,Y) and j∈L(Y,F) so that T = jk and the identity IY of the space Y belongs to U.

We now give a list of closed operator ideals which are injective, surjective or factorizable. We recall the definition of the most commonly used, and give a reference for the others.

An operator T∈L(E,F) is (weakly) compact if T(BE) is a relatively (weakly) compact subset of F; T is (weakly) completely continuous if it takes weak Cauchy sequences in E into (weakly) convergent sequences in F; T is Rosenthal if every sequence in T(BE) has a weak Cauchy subsequence; T is unconditionally converging if it takes weakly unconditionally Cauchy series in E into unconditionally convergent series in F.

The results on this list may be found in [\cite=Pi] and the other references given, for the injective and surjective case. The factorizable case may be seen in [\cite=H].

If U is an operator ideal, the dual ideal Ud is the ideal of all operators T such that the adjoint T* belongs to U. Easily, we have:

[formula]

The list above might therefore be completed with some more dual ideals.

Moreover, to each T∈L(E,F) we can associate an operator Tq:E*  * / E  →  F*  * / F given by Tq(x*  * + E) = T*  *(x*  *) + F. Let Uq: = {T∈L(E,F):Tq∈U}. Then, if U is injective (resp. surjective, closed), so is Uq [\cite=Go].

Surjective factorization

In this Section, we study the factorizations in the form [formula], with T∈U, where U is a closed surjective operator ideal.

[\cite=JaWCO] Given a closed surjective operator ideal U, let S∈L(E,F) and suppose that for every ε > 0 there are a Banach space [formula] and an operator [formula] such that

[formula]

Then, S∈U.

We denote by CU(E) the collection of all A  ⊂  E so that A  ⊆  T(BZ) for some Banach space Z and some operator T∈U(Z,E) (see [\cite=S]).

The following probably well-known properties of CU will be needed:

Proof. (a) is trivial and (b) is easy. Both are true without any assumption on the operator ideal U.

(c) For A  ⊂  E bounded, consider the operator

[formula]

Given ε > 0, there is [formula] such that [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Clearly, [formula]. Hence, T∈U (by Lemma [\ref=surjid]), and A∈CU(E).

(d) If A∈CU(E), there is a space Z and T∈U(Z,E) such that A  ⊆  T(BZ). Therefore, for all ε > 0,

[formula]

Now, it is enough to apply part (c). [formula]

We shall denote by HU(E,F) the space of all f∈H(E,F) such that each x∈E has a neighbourhood Vx with f(Vx)∈CU(F). Easily, a polynomial P∈P(k E,F) belongs to HU(E,F) if and only if P(BE)∈CU(F). The set of all such polynomials will be denoted by PU(k E,F).

The following result is an easy consequence of the Hahn-Banach theorem and the Cauchy inequality

[\cite=RyWCo] Given f∈H(E,F), a circled subset U  ⊂  E, and x∈E, we have

[formula]

for every [formula].

Proof. (a) ⇒   (c) and (b) ⇒   (d) follow from Lemma [\ref=Cauchy].

(d) ⇒   (a) Let x∈E. There is ε > 0 such that

[formula]

uniformly for y∈B(x,ε) [\cite=Na]. By Proposition [\ref=propCU](b), for each [formula], we have

[formula]

Using the uniform convergence on B(x,ε), and Proposition [\ref=propCU](c), we conclude that f(B(x,ε))∈CU(F).

(a) ⇒   (b) and (c) ⇒   (d) are trivial. [formula]

If A is a closed convex balanced, bounded subset of F, FA will denote the Banach space obtained by taking the linear span of A with the norm given by its Minkowski functional.

Proof. (a) ⇒   (b) follows the ideas in the proof of [\cite=AS] and [\cite=RyWCo].

For each [formula] and x∈E, define

[formula]

and

[formula]

For each x∈E there is a neighbourhood of the compact set {λx:|λ|  ≤  1} on which f is bounded. Hence, there is [formula] so that [formula], which shows that [formula].

Let Wm be the balanced hull of Um. Since the sets Am(x) are balanced, we have |f(x)|  ≤  m for all x∈Wm. Let Vm: = 2- 1Wm. We have [formula] and hence

[formula]

For each [formula], define

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=propCU], we obtain that the set

[formula]

belongs to CU(F). Easily, f(Vm)  ⊆  Km. Hence f(Vm)∈CU(F) for all [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=propCU], we can select numbers βm > 0 with [formula] so that

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=fE]) that f maps E into FK.

It remains to show that f∈H(E,FK). Let x∈E. Easily, there are ε > 0 and [formula] such that f(B(x,2ε))  ⊆  rK. By Lemma [\ref=Cauchy],

[formula]

for all [formula]. Now, for each [formula] and a∈B(0,ε), we have

[formula]

Since K is convex and closed, we get from ([\ref=contmK]) that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

and so, the FK-norm of the left hand side is less than or equal to 2- nr, for all a∈B(0,ε). Thus, f is holomorphic.

(b) ⇒   (c). It is enough to note that, by Lemma [\ref=surjid], the natural inclusion FK  →  F belongs to U.

(c) ⇒   (a). Each x∈E has a neighbourhood Vx such that g(Vx) is bounded in G. Hence, f(Vx) = T(g(Vx))∈CU(F).
