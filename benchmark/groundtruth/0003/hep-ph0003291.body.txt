Fig.1 The Feynman diagrams of the subprocess gg  →  0i0j.

Fig.2 Dependence of the cross sections for the productions of 0102 and 0202 pairs on the factorization scale Q with the mSUGRA parameters m0 = 100 ~ GeV, m1 / 2 = 150 ~ GeV, A = 300 ~ GeV, tan β = 4 and μ > 0. The masses of 01 02 are 51.4 ~ GeV and 98 ~ GeV.

Fig.3 The cross sections for the neutralino pair production at the gaugino-like neutralino case and higgsino-like neutralino case at the LHC. For the gaugino-like neutralino case , the parameters are chosen in mSUGRA scenario with m0 = 100 ~ GeV, m1 / 2 = 150 ~ GeV, A = 300 ~ GeV, tan β = 4 and μ > 0. For the higgsino-like neutralino case, we choose M1 = 150 ~ GeV, M2 = 210 ~ GeV, μ = 90 ~ GeV and the other parameters the same as those in the gaugino-like neutralino case.

Fig.4 Total cross sections of the process pp  →  gg + X  →  0i0j + X as function of m02 at the LHC. The solid curve is for 0102 pair production and the dashed curve is for 0202 pair production.

Fig.5 Total cross sections of the process pp  →  gg + X  →  0i0j + X as function of tan β at the LHC. The solid curve is for 0102 pair production and the dashed curve is for 0202 pair production.
