Remarks on plane maximal curves

Introduction

A [formula]-maximal curve of genus g is a projective, geometrically irreducible, non-singular, algebraic curve defined over a finite field [formula] of order q2 such that the number of its [formula]-rational points attains the Hasse-Weil upper bound

[formula]

Maximal curves, especially those having large genus with respect to q, are known to be very useful in Coding theory [\cite=goppa]. Also, there are various ways of employing them in Cryptography, and it is expected that this interesting connection will be be explored more fully, see [\cite=shpar]. Other motivation for the study of maximal curves comes from Correlations of Shift Register Sequences [\cite=L-N], Exponentials Sums over Finite Fields [\cite=moreno], and Finite Geometry [\cite=hirschfeld]. Recent papers on maximal curves which also contain background and expository accounts are [\cite=r-sti], [\cite=sti-x], [\cite=ft], [\cite=fgt], [\cite=geer-vl], [\cite=ft1], [\cite=ckt1], [\cite=gt], [\cite=chkt], [\cite=at], [\cite=ckt2], and [\cite=kt].

A relevant result on [formula]-maximal curves X with genus g states that either g = q(q - 1) / 2 and X is [formula]-isomorphic to the Hermitian curve H of equation

[formula]

or g  ≤  (q - 1)2 / 4; see [\cite=ihara], [\cite=sti-x], and [\cite=ft]. One expects that the bound (q - 1)2 / 4 can be substantially lowered apart from a certain number of exceptional values of g. Finding such values is one of the problems of current interest in the study of maximal curves; see [\cite=fgt], [\cite=ft1], [\cite=ckt1], and [\cite=at].

In this paper we investigate plane maximal curves. In Section [\ref=s2] we prove the non-existence of a plane [formula]-maximal curve whose genus belongs to the interval (q(q - 2) / 8,q(q - 2) / 4], for q even, and ((q - 1)(q - 3) / 8,(q - 1)2 / 4] for q odd; see Corollary [\ref=cor2.1]. The curves studied in Section [\ref=s3] show that these bounds are sharp in some cases. In contrast, a few examples of (non planar) [formula]-maximal curves with genera in these intervals are known to exist; see [\cite=fgt], [\cite=ckt1], [\cite=at], [\cite=g-sti-x], and [\cite=ckt2].

In the course of our investigation we point out that the Hermitian curve H is the unique [formula]-maximal curve (up to [formula]-isomorphism) which is [formula]-Frobenius non-classical with respect to the linear series Σ1 cut out by lines; see Proposition [\ref=prop2.1]. Also, the order of contact ε2 of a non-classical (with respect to Σ1) [formula]-maximal curve with the tangent at a general point satisfies ε22  ≤  q / p, where [formula]; see Corollary [\ref=cor2.2]. In particular, plane [formula]-maximal curves with q = p and q = p2 are classical with respect to Σ1.

According to [\cite=lachaud], every curve which is [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve is [formula]-maximal. An open problem of considerable interest is to decide whether the converse of this statement also holds. In Section [\ref=s3] we solve this problem for the family of the so-called Hurwitz curves. Recall that a Hurwitz curve of degree n + 1 is defined as a non-singular plane curve of equation

[formula]

where [formula] does not divide n2 - n + 1. Theorem [\ref=thm3.1] together with Corollary [\ref=cor3.1] states indeed that the Hurwitz curve is [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve if and only if

[formula]

It should be noted on the other hand that for certain n and p, the Hurwitz curve is not [formula]-maximal for any power q of p; this occurs, for instance, for n = 3 and [formula]. One can then ask for conditions in terms of n and p which assure that the Hurwitz curve is [formula]-maximal for some power q of p. Our results in this direction are given in Remarks [\ref=rem3.0] and [\ref=rem3.01], and Corollaries [\ref=cor3.3], [\ref=cor3.4]. They generalise some previous results obtained in [\cite=carbonne-henocq]. Another feature of the Hurwitz curve is that it is non-classical provided that pe divides n with pe  ≥  3; see Remark [\ref=rem3.1]. So if both ([\ref=eq1.2]) and pe|n hold then the Hurwitz curve turns out to be a non-classical plane [formula]-maximal curve. As far as we know, these Hurwitz curves together with the Hermitian curves and the Fermat curves of degree n2 - n + 1 (see Corollary [\ref=cor3.1]), are the only known examples of non-classical plane [formula]-maximal curves. As mentioned before, these curves show the sharpness of some of the results obtained in Section [\ref=s2].

Hurwitz curves as well as their generalizations have been investigated for several reasons by many authors; see [\cite=bennama-carbonne] and [\cite=pellikaan]. This gives a motivation to the final Section [\ref=s4] where we show that the main results of Section [\ref=s3] extend to (the non-singular model of) the curve with equation

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] does not divide [formula].

Our investigation uses some concepts, such as non-classicity, from Stöhr-Voloch's paper [\cite=sv] where an alternative proof to the Hasse-Weil bound was given among other things. We also refer to that paper for terminology and background results on orders and Frobenius orders of linear series on curves.

The degree of a plane maximal curve

Let X be a plane [formula]-maximal curve of degree d  ≥  2. Since the genus of X is equal to (d - 1)(d - 2) / 2, the upper bound for g quoted in Sec. [\ref=s1] can be rephrased in terms of d:

[formula]

The main result in this section is the improvement of ([\ref=eq1.1]) given in Theorem [\ref=thm2.1]: Apart from small q's, either d = q + 1, or d = ⌊(q + 2) / 2⌋, or d is upper bounded by a certain function d5(q) such that d5(q) / q  ≈  2 / 5. Our first step consists in lowering d1(q) to d2(q) with d2(q) / q  ≈  1 / 2.

Let Σ1 be the linear series cut out by lines of [formula] on X. For P∈X, let j0(P) = 0 < j1(P) = 1 < j2(P) be the (Σ1,P)-orders, and ε0 = 0 < ε1 = 1 < ε2 (resp. ν0 = 0 < ν1) the orders (resp. [formula]-Frobenius orders) of Σ1. We let p be the characteristic of [formula].

ν1∈{1,ε2};

ε2  ≤  q;

ε2 is a power of p whenever ε2 > 2.

For (1), see [\cite=sv]. For (2), suppose that ε2 > q, then ε2 = q + 1 as ε2  ≤  d and d  ≤  q + 1 by ([\ref=eq1.1]). Then, by the p-adic criterion [\cite=sv], q would be a Σ1-order, a contradiction. For (3), see [\cite=garcia-voloch].

The following result is a complement to [\cite=pardini], [\cite=homma], and [\cite=hefez-voloch].

For a plane [formula]-maximal curve X of degree d  ≥  3, the following conditions are equivalent:

d = q + 1;

X is [formula]-isomorphic to the Hermitian of equation ([\ref=hermitian]);

ε2 = q;

ν1 = q;

j2(P) = q + 1 for each [formula]

ν1 > 1; i.e, Σ1 is [formula]-Frobenius non-classical.

[formula] Since the genus of a non-singular plane curve of degree d is q(q - 1) / 2, part (2) follows from [\cite=r-sti].

[formula] This is well known property of the Hermitian curve; see e.g. [\cite=ft] or [\cite=garcia-viana].

[formula] If q = 2, then from d  ≥  ε2 = q and ([\ref=eq1.1]), either d = 2 or d = 3. By hypothesis, d = 3 can only occur, and so, by parts (1) and (2), X is [formula]-isomorphic to the Hermitian curve X3 + Y3 + Z3 = 0. Then ν1  =  ε2 = 2; see loc. cit.

Let q  ≥  3. By Lemma [\ref=lemma2.1](1), ν1∈{1,q}. Suppose that ν1 = 1 and let S1 be the [formula]-Frobenius divisor associated to Σ1. Then [\cite=sv]

[formula]

so that ((2q - 1)d - (q2 + 2q + 1))(d - 2)  ≤  0, and hence

[formula]

Thus, as d  ≥  ε2 = q, we would have q2 - 3q - 1  ≤  0 and hence q  ≤  3. If q = 3, from ([\ref=eq2.1]) we have that d = 3; this contradicts [\cite=pardini] (cf. Remark [\ref=rem2.2](ii)).

[formula] By [\cite=sv], ν1  ≤  j2(P) - 1 for any [formula]. Then part (5) follows as j2(P)  ≤  d and d  ≤  q + 1 by ([\ref=eq1.1]).

[formula] Suppose that ν1 = 1. Then, by [\cite=sv], vP(S1)  ≥  q + 1 for any [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

a contradiction as 3  ≤  d  ≤  q + 1.

[formula] From [\cite=hefez-voloch] and the [formula]-maximality of X we have

[formula]

Since 2g - 2 = d(d - 3) and d > 1, part (1) follows.

Let d  ≥  3 be the degree of a plane [formula]-maximal curve. Then either d = q + 1 or In particular, for q  ≠  3,5, a [formula]-maximal curve has no non-singular plane model if its genus is assumed to belong to the interval (q(q - 2) / 8,q(q - 2) / 4], for q even, and ((q - 1)(q - 3) / 8,(q - 1)2 / 4], for q odd.

The statement on the genus follows immediately from the upper bound on d. By ([\ref=eq1.1]) we have that d  ≤  q + 1. If d < q + 1, then q  ≥  3 and from Proposition [\ref=prop2.1] Σ1 is [formula]-Frobenius classical. In particular, ([\ref=eq2.1]) holds true; i.e., we have d  ≤  F(q). It is easy to see that F(q) < (q + 3) / 2 for q > 5 and that F(4) = 25 / 7. Moreover, F(3) = 16 / 5 and F(5) = 4, and the result follows.

Let d be the degree of a plane [formula]-maximal curve of degree d and assume that 3  ≤  d  ≤  d2(q).

(i) If q is odd, then the [formula]-maximal curve of equation

[formula]

shows that the upper bound d2(q) = (q + 1) / 2 in Corollary [\ref=cor2.1] is the best possible as far as q  ≠  3,5. We notice that this curve is the unique [formula]-maximal plane curve (up to [formula]-isomorphism) of degree (q + 1) / 2 provided that q  ≥  11; see [\cite=chkt].

(ii) From results of Deuring, Tate and Watherhouse (see e.g. [\cite=ughi]), there exist elliptic [formula]-maximal curves for any q. In particular, d2(q) = 3 is sharp for q = 3.

(iii) From [\cite=serre], there exists a plane quartic [formula]-maximal; so d2(q) = 4 is sharp for q = 5.

(iv) By part (ii), d2(q) = 3 is sharp for q = 4. For q  ≥  8, q even, no information is currently available to asses how good the bound d2(q) = (q + 2) / 2 is.

We go on to look for an upper bound for the degree d of a [formula]-maximal curve satisfying the condition d < ⌊(q + 2) / 2⌋. Our approach is inspired on [\cite=chkt] where the [formula]-Frobenius divisor S2 associated with the linear series Σ2 cut out on X by conics was employed to obtain upper bounds for the number of [formula]-rational points of plane curves. In fact, if we use Σ2 instead of Σ1, we can get better results for values of d ranging in certain intervals depending on q. This was pointed out at the first time in [\cite=garcia-voloch1]. In order to compute the Σ2-orders of a plane [formula]-maximal curve X, one needs to know whether X is classical or not with respect to Σ1. This gives the motivation to Proposition [\ref=prop2.2]. The following remark will be useful in the proof.

(i) If a projective, geometrically irreducible, non-singular, algebraic curve defined over a field of characteristic p > 0 admits a linear series Σ of degree D, then Σ is classical provided that p > D; see [\cite=sv].

(ii) If a non-singular plane curve of degree D defined over a field of characteristic p >  is non-classical with respect to the linear series cut out by lines, then [formula]; see [\cite=pardini], and [\cite=homma1].

Let X be a plane [formula]-maximal curve of degree d such that 3  ≤  d  ≤  d2(q), where d2(q) is as in Corollary [\ref=cor2.1]. Then the linear series Σ1 on X is classical provided that one of the following conditions holds:

p  ≥  d or [formula]

q = 4,8,16,32;

p  ≥  3 and either q = p or q = p2;

p = 2, q  ≥  64, and either d  ≤  4, or d  ≥  d3(q): = q / 4 - 1 for q = 64,128,256, or d  ≥  d3(q): = q / 4 for q  ≥  512;

p  ≥  3, q = pv with v  ≥  3, and d  ≥  d3(q): = q / p - p + 2.

If (i) holds, then Σ1 is classical by Remark [\ref=rem2.2]. For q = p, the hypothesis on d yields p  ≥  3 and hence d  ≤  (p + 1) / 2 < p. Thus Σ1 is classical by Remark [\ref=rem2.2](i). Note that the following computations will provide another proof of this fact. For the rest of the proof we assume Σ1 to be non-classical, and we show that no one of the conditions (i),,(v) holds. From Lemma [\ref=lemma2.1](3), ε2  ≥  M, where M = 4 for p = 2, and M = p for p  ≥  3. Also, ν1 = 1 by Proposition [\ref=prop2.1]. Therefore, as j2(P)  ≥  ε2 for each P∈X [\cite=sv]. From [\cite=sv] we have that vP(S1)  ≥  M for each [formula], where as before S1 denotes the [formula]-Frobenius divisor associated to Σ1. Thus,

[formula]

or, equivalently,

[formula]

On the other hand, the discriminant of the above quadratic polynomial in d is

[formula]

and hence ΔM(q) < 0 if and only if either q = 4,8,16,32 and M = 4, or q = p,p2 and M = p  ≥  3. For these q's, the above inequality cannot actually hold, and hence Σ1 must be classical. Furthermore, if ΔM(q)  ≥  0, then

[formula]

It is easy to check that F'(4,q) > 4, F(4,q) < q / 4 - 1 for q = 64,128,256, and that F(4,q) < q / 4 for q  ≥  512; hence if (iv) holds, then Σ1 must be classical. Let p  ≥  3. If q / p - p + 2  ≤  d  ≤  q / p, then Σ1 must be classical by (i). So we can suppose that d  ≥  q / p + 1. It turns out that F(p,q) < q / p + 1 and hence the result follows when (v) is assumed to be true.

For q = p3, p  ≥  3, the bound d3(q) in Proposition [\ref=prop2.2] is sharp. Indeed, there exists a plane [formula]-maximal curve of degree p2 - p + 1 which is non-classical for Σ1; see Corollary [\ref=cor3.1] and Remark [\ref=rem3.1].

Let X be a plane [formula]-maximal curve of degree d as in Proposition [\ref=prop2.2]. Assume that X is non-classical for Σ1 and let ε2 be the order of contact of X with the tangent at a general point. Then

q  ≥  64 if p = 2, and q  ≥  p3 for p  ≥  3;

ε22  ≤  q / p.

Part (1) follows from Proposition [\ref=prop2.2](ii)(iii). To prove (2), we first note that ε2 < q (cf. Proposition [\ref=prop2.1]), and that ε2 is a power of p (see Lemma [\ref=lemma2.1](3)). Now, with the same notation as in the proof of the previous proposition, we get d  ≤  F(M,q) with M = ε2. So d  ≤  q / ε2. Furthermore, d  ≥  ε2 and so d  ≥  ε2 + 1 by Remark [\ref=rem2.2](ii). Hence ε2 + 1  ≤  q / ε2 and part (2) follows.

The example in Remark [\ref=rem2.3] shows that Corollary [\ref=cor2.2](1) is sharp for p  ≥  3.

Our next step is to show that every plane [formula]-maximal curve which is classical for Σ1 contains an [formula]-rational point different from its inflexions.

Let X be a [formula]-maximal curve of degree d  ≥  3 which is classical with respect to Σ1. Then there exists [formula] whose (Σ1,P0)-orders are 0,1,2.

Let R1 be the ramification divisor associated to Σ1 and suppose that j2(P)  ≥  3 for each [formula]. Then from [\cite=sv],

[formula]

which is a contradiction as g  ≥  1 and 3  ≤  d < q + 1.

It should be noticed that Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2] improves a previous result, see [\cite=chkt].

We are in a position to establish some useful properties of the linear series Σ2 cut out by conics of [formula] on plane [formula]-maximal curve X of degree d  ≥  3. Since X is non-singular, Σ2 = 2Σ1. Taking into account d  ≥  3, we see that Σ2 is a 5-dimensional linear series of degree 2d.

Let d be the degree of a plane [formula]-maximal curve X. Let q = 8 or q  ≥  11, and suppose that

[formula]

where d2(q) is as in Corollary [\ref=cor2.1]. Then the orders (resp. [formula]-Frobenius orders) of Σ2 are 0,1,2,3,4,ε (resp. 0,1,2,3,ε) with 5  ≤  ε  ≤  q. Furthermore, p divides ε.

By some computations we obtain that d4(q) is bigger than d3(q) in Proposition [\ref=prop2.2]. So the curve X is classical for Σ1. Let [formula] be as in Lemma [\ref=lemma2.2]. Then the (Σ2,P0)-orders are 0,1,2,3,4 and j0 with 5  ≤  j0  ≤  2d (cf. [\cite=garcia-voloch]). Therefore, the Σ2-orders are 0,1,2,3,4 and ε with 5  ≤  ε  ≤  j0. Since j0  ≤  2d, from Corollary [\ref=cor2.1], ε  ≤  q + 2, and hence ε  ≤  q by the p-adic criterion [\cite=sv]. Also, the [formula]-Frobenius orders of Σ2 are 0,1,2,3 and ν with ν∈{4,ε}; see [\cite=sv]. Suppose that ν = 4 and keep up S2 to denote the [formula]-Frobenius divisor associated to Σ2. Then [\cite=sv]

[formula]

or equivalently

[formula]

The discriminant of this equation is 4q2 - 40q3 + 145q2 - 300q + 600 and it is positive for any q. Since d4(q) is the biggest root of the quadratic polynomial in d above, d  ≤  d4(q), a contradiction. Finally, p divides ε by [\cite=garcia-homma].

Let d4(q) be as in Lemma [\ref=lemma2.3] and for q = pv, v  ≥  2, let d4(p,q) denote the function

[formula]

Let d be the degree of a plane [formula]-maximal curve X. Suppose that 3  ≤  d < q + 1 and that q = 8 or q  ≥  11. Then

Suppose that d > d5(q). By means of some computations, d5(p,q) > d4(q) and hence Lemma [\ref=lemma2.3] holds true. With the same notation as in the proof of that lemma, we can then use the following two facts: ε  =  ν  ≤  q, and p|ε. Actually, we will improve the latter one.

ε is a power of p.

Indeed, by p|ε and the p-adic criterion [\cite=sv], a necessary and sufficient condition for ε not to be a power of p is that p∈{2,3} and ε = 6. If this occurs, one can argue as in the previous proof and obtain the following result:

[formula]

From this,

[formula]

which is a contradiction as G(q) < d5(q).

ε = q.

The claim is certainly true for q = p. So, q = pv, with v  ≥  2. If ε < q, by Claim [\ref=claim2.1] we have ε  ≤  q / p. Thus, this fact together with

[formula]

would yield

[formula]

and hence d  ≤  d4(p,q), a contradiction.

Now from Claim [\ref=claim2.2] and [\cite=sv], we have

[formula]

and Theorem [\ref=thm2.1] follows from Corollary [\ref=cor2.1].

Maximal Hurwitz's curves

In this section we give a necessary and sufficient condition for q in order that the Hurwitz curve Xn defined by Eq. ([\ref=hurwitz]) be [formula]-maximal.

The curve Xn is [formula]-maximal if and only if ([\ref=eq1.2]) holds.

We first prove two lemmas.

The Hurwitz curve Xn is [formula]-covered by the Fermat curve Fn2 - n + 1

[formula]

Let u = U / W and v: = V / W. Then the image of the morphism (u:v:1)  →  (x:y:1) = (unv- 1:uvn - 1:1) is the curve defined by xny + yn + x = 0. This proves the lemma.

Suppose that ([\ref=eq1.2]) holds. Then both curves Xn and Fn2 - n + 1 are [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve of equation ([\ref=hermitian]). In particular, both are [formula]-maximal.

If ([\ref=eq1.2]) holds, it is clear that Fn2 - n + 1 is [formula]-covered by the Hermitian curve. This property extends to Xn via the previous lemma. For both curves, the [formula]-maximality now follows from [\cite=lachaud].

The Weierstrass semigroup of Xn at the point (0:1:0) is generated by the set [formula].

Let P0: = (1:0:0), P1 = (0:1:0), and P2 = (0:0:1). Then div(x) = nP2 - (n - 1)P1 - P0 and div(y) = (n - 1)P0 + P2 - nP1 so that

[formula]

This shows that S is contained in the Weierstrass semigroup H(P1) at P1. In particular, H(P1)  ⊇  〈S〉. Since [formula] (see [\cite=grant]), the result follows.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm3.1]. If ([\ref=eq1.2]) holds, then Xn is [formula]-maximal by Corollary [\ref=cor3.1]. Conversely, assume that Xn is [formula]-maximal. Then (q + 1)P1  ~  (q + 1)P2 [\cite=r-sti], and the case s = n in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2] gives (n2 - n + 1)P1  ~  (n2 - n + 1)P2. Therefore d: =  gcd(n2 - n + 1,q + 1) belongs to H(P1). According to Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2] we have that d = A(n - 1) + B with A  ≥  B  ≥  1. Now, there exists C  ≥  1 such that (A(n - 1) + B)C = n2 - n + 1 and so BC = D(n - 1) + 1 for some D  ≥  0. Therefore, AD(n - 1) + A + BD = Bn. We claim that D = 0, otherwise the left side of the last equality would be bigger than Bn. Then B = C = 1 and so A = n; i.e., d = n2 - n + 1 and the proof is complete.

The curve Fn2 - n + 1 in Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1] is [formula]-maximal if and only if ([\ref=eq1.2]) holds.

If ([\ref=eq1.2]) is satisfied, the result follows from Corollary [\ref=cor3.1]. Now if Fn2 - n + 1 is [formula]-maximal, then Xn is also [formula]-maximal by Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1] and [\cite=lachaud]. Then the corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=thm3.1].

For a given positive integer n, we are led to look for a power q of a prime p such that [formula] with m = n2 - n + 1. Since [formula], and [formula], a necessary and sufficient condition for q to have the requested property ([\ref=eq1.2]) is [formula], where x is a solution of the congruence [formula], and w is defined by q = pφ(m)v + w, [formula]; here φ denotes the Euler function.

Regarding specific examples, we notice that Carbonne and Henocq [\cite=carbonne-henocq] pointed out that Xn is [formula]-maximal in the following cases:

n = 3, q = p6v + 3 and [formula];

n = 4, q = p12v + 6 and [formula].

By using Theorem [\ref=thm3.1] and Remark [\ref=rem3.0] we have the following result.

The curve X2 is [formula]-maximal if and only if q = p2v + 1 and [formula]

The curve X3 is [formula]-maximal if and only if either q = p6v + 1 and [formula], or q = p6v + 3 and [formula], or q = p6v + 5 and [formula]

The curve X4 is [formula]-maximal if and only if either q = p12v + 1 and [formula], or q = p12v + 2 and [formula], or q = p12v + 3 and [formula], or q = p12v + 5 and [formula], or q = p12v + 6 and [formula], or q = p12v + 7 and [formula], or q = p12v + 9 and [formula], or q = p12v + 11 and [formula]

Let n be a positive integer, m: = n2 - n + 1 and p a prime.

If n = pe with e  ≥  1, then the curve Xn is [formula]-maximal with q = pφ(m)v + 3e.

Let [formula] and [formula] such that m is prime and that [formula]. Then Xn is [formula]-maximal with q = p(m - 1)v + (m - 1) / 2.

Part (1) follows from the identity p3e + 1 = (pe + 1)(p2e - pe + 1) and Theorem [\ref=thm3.1].

To show (2), it is enough to check that [formula]. Recall that the Legendre symbol (a / p) is defined by: In our case, since [formula], (m / p) = 1. By the quadratic reciprocity low

[formula]

from (m / p) = 1 and [formula] we get (p / m) = ( - 1)(p - 1) / 2. Now, as [formula], we have that (p / m) =  - 1. In other words, p viewed as an element in [formula] is a non-square in [formula]. Since - 1 is as well a non-square in [formula], it follows then that [formula] with [formula] such that [formula]. Hence [formula] as, in particular, m is odd and as [formula].

The hypothesis [formula] in the above corollary cannot be relaxed. In fact, for n = 4 we have m = 13 but, according with Corollary [\ref=cor3.3], X4 is no [formula]-maximal.

Let us assume the hypothesis in Corollary [\ref=cor3.4](2) with m not necessarily prime. In this case, to study the congruence in ([\ref=eq1.2]) we have to consider the multiplicative group Φm of the units in [formula]. This group has order φ(m), and p∈Φm since [formula]. Now suppose that p, as an element of Φm, has even order 2i. Then [formula] and hence [formula]. Since p has order greater than i, we have that [formula] unless both pi + 1 and pi - 1 are zero divisors in [formula]. If we assume that this does not happen, then equivalence ([\ref=eq1.2]) follows for q = pφ(m)v + i.

Let p be a prime, n: = peu with e  ≥  1 and  gcd(p,u) = 1. Assume e  ≥  2 if p = 2. Then the Hurwitz curve Xn as well as the curve Fn2 - n + 1 are non-classical with respect to Σ1. It is easy to see that 0,1 and pe are their Σ1-orders.

On the maximality of generalized Hurwitz curves

In this section we investigate the [formula]-maximality of the non-singular model of the so-called generalized Hurwitz curve [formula] of equation

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] does not divide [formula]. The singular points of [formula] are P0: = (1:0:0), P1 = (0:1:0), and P2 = (0:0:1); each of them is unibranched with δ-invariant equal to [formula]. Therefore its genus g (cf. [\cite=bennama-carbonne] and [\cite=beelen-pellikaan]) is equal to

[formula]

First we generalize Lemma [\ref=lemma3.1].

The curve [formula] is [formula]-covered by the Fermat curve [formula]

[formula]

The curve [formula] is [formula]-covered by [formula] via the morphism (u:v:1)  →  (x:y:1): = (unv- m:umvn - m:1), where u: = U / W and v: = V / W.

From this lemma and [\cite=lachaud] we have the following.

The curve [formula] in the above lemma and the [formula]-non-singular model of [formula] are [formula]-maximal provided that

[formula]

Now, we generalize Lemma [\ref=lemma3.2] for any two coprime n and [formula]. For 0  ≤  i  ≤  2, let Qi be the unique point in the non-singular model of [formula] lying over Pi.

Suppose that [formula]. Then the Weierstrass semigroup H(Q1) at Q1 is given by

[formula]

Let x: = X / Z,y: = Y / Z. It is not difficult to see that [formula] and [formula]. Hence, for [formula],

[formula]

and hence [formula] provided that [formula] and [formula]. Let H denote the set introduced in ([\ref=eq4.2]). Then H  ⊆  H(Q1), and it is easily checked that H is a semigroup. By means of some computations we see that [formula], whence H = H(Q1) follows.

The above Weierstrass semigroup H(Q1) was computed for [formula], and [formula] in [\cite=bennama-carbonne].

We are able to generalize Theorem [\ref=thm3.1] for certain curves [formula].

Assume that [formula] and that [formula] is prime. Then [formula] is [formula]-maximal if and only if () holds.

The "if" part follows from Corollary [\ref=cor4.1] and here we do not use the hypothesis that Q is prime. For the "only if" part, we first notice that each Qi is [formula]-rational. Now the case s = n - m and t = m in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma4.2] gives QQ2  ~  QQ1. Therefore d =  gcd(Q,q + 1)∈H(Q1) because (q + 1)Q1  ~  (q + 1)Q2 [\cite=r-sti]. As [formula] and Q is prime, the result follows.

Let n, [formula] and Q be as in Theorem [\ref=thm4.1]. Then the curve [formula] in Lemma [\ref=lemma4.1] is [formula]-maximal if and only if ([\ref=eq4.1]) holds.

Similar to the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor3.2].

There are infinitely many [formula] with [formula] such that [formula] is prime. In fact, for a prime p' such that [formula], there exists such n and [formula] so that [formula]; see [\cite=bennama-carbonne].
