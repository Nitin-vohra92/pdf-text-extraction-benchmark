The volume and lengths on a three sphere

Introduction

In this paper we consider the volume, Vol(g), of a Riemannian metric g on the three sphere. We let L(g) represent the length of the shortest nontrivial closed geodesic in (S3,g). By an "antipodal map", A, on an n-sphere we will mean an order 2, fixed point free diffeomorphism. We will let D(g,A) =  inf x∈S3d(x,Ax), and D(g)  =   sup AD(g,A). The main result of this paper is:

For any Riemannian metric on S3 we have:

[formula]

where C1 is a universal constant (which can be taken to be [formula])

This theorem is an example of a "universal" inequality. This is a term introduced by Berger to describe inequalities on a Riemannian manifold (M,g) (usually between minimizing objects in some topological class) which hold for all metrics g on M. With the glaring exception of Gromov's work [\cite=Gr] (which we discuss below) most such inequalities are known in 2 dimensions only. Many of these inequalities involve the systole, sys(g), which is the length of the shortest closed noncontractible curve in M. Estimates of the form [formula], Where A(g) represents the area, have been proved for all surfaces M. The first of these was proved by Loewner (unpublished) where he finds the sharp value of c(T2) (sharp for the flat regular hexagonal torus). The sharp values of c(RP2) and c(K2) for the projective plane (the round one is best) and Klein bottle (the best one is singular and not flat!) were proven by Pu [\cite=Pu] and Bavard [\cite=Ba] respectively. For surfaces of genus γ, nonsharp constants c(γ) (which unfortunately went to 0 as γ grew) were first proved independently by Accola [\cite=Ac] and Blatter [\cite=Bl]. Gromov greatly improve these constants in [\cite=Gr] so that they grow correctly with γ. However, the best constants are still unknown. Finding them is likely to be an extremely hard problem.

None of the above says anything about S2 since it is simply connected. However there are two inequalities of this type on S2. The first, due to Berger [\cite=Be] says that there is a universal constant c2 such that for any antipodal map A:S2  →  S2:

[formula]

The sharp constant is not known, but is conjectured to be that of the round sphere. The other result (see [\cite=Cr2]) is that

[formula]

Also in this case the sharp constant is not known. It is conjectured to be that for the singular metric one gets by gluing two flat equilateral triangles along their boundaries.

We now turn to higher dimensions. The most important results in the area are in Gromov's paper "Filling Riemannian Manifolds" [\cite=Gr]. Gromov shows that for essential manifolds (which includes Tn, RPn, and all compact K(π,1) spaces) we have [formula]. However, this says nothing directly about Sn (or any compact simply connected manifold). For example the natural generalizations of 1.1 and 1.2 above for S2 are open questions for Sn, n  ≥  3. Note that for any Riemannian manifold (M,g) of injectivity radius inj(M) and any [formula] the metric spheres S(x,r) with their induced Riemannian metrics [formula] satisfy D(,A)  ≥  2r, so an estimate [formula] which was sharp for the round spheres would give sharp estimates for the volume of small metric spheres. See [\cite=Cr1] for nonsharp estimates for the volume of such metric spheres.

In the other direction, Ivanov (see [\cite=I1] or [\cite=I2]) has given examples of a sequence of metrics on S3 that Gromov-Housdorff converge to the standard metric but whose volumes go to zero.

Although Theorem [\ref=main] does not yield either 1.1. or 1.2 for S3 it does show that for any given metric one or the other inequality must hold.

For A:S3  →  S3 an antipodal map we let L(g,A) be the infimum of the lengths of curves, γ such that γ links A(γ). Here we will say γ links τ if either γ intersects τ or the linking number of γ and τ is nonzero. We consider two cases. If there is no closed curve γ that links A(γ) of length less than 2D(g,A) then L(g,A) = 2D(g,A) and the minimum length γ is the union of two minimizing geodesics between x and A(x) for some x. Otherwise there is such a closed curve γ. In this case we can apply curve shortening to γ to get a continuous family γt each of which is shorter than γ and hence does not intersect A(γt). Thus we see that γt links with A(γt) and hence has length bounded below by L(g,A). By looking at limits of such γt we find nontrivial closed geodesics of length less than the length of γ. Since this is true for all such γ we find that there is a closed geodesic of length L(g,A). Thus the invariants L(g) and D(g,A) are thus related to L(g,A) via:

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=main] thus will follow from:

For any Riemannian metric on S3 and any antipodal map A, we have:

[formula]

where C1 is a universal constant (which can be taken to be [formula])

The fundamental result in the proof of Gromov's isosystolic inequality is his filling radius theorem: [formula], which holds for all Riemannian n-manifolds (here c3 < 265). We define the filling radius, Fillrad(g), in the next section. We also make fundamental use of it since Theorem [\ref=main2] will thus follow from

For any Riemannian metric on S3 and any antipodal map A, we have:

[formula]

Where C4 is a universal constant (which can be taken to be [formula])

The proof of this theorem is a generalization of an argument that works on S2 to yield:

For any Riemannian metric on S2 we and any antipodal map A we have:

[formula]

This theorem along with the Filling radius theorem recovers Berger's estimate equation 1.1 (although with a worse constant). We present the argument in section [\ref=secfill2].

Notation/Preliminaries

The main purpose of this section is to set up notation and remind the reader about the Filling radius (for details see [\cite=Gr]):

In [\cite=Gr] Gromov introduced the notion of the filling radius (we use integer coefficients) Fillrad(M) of a closed n-dimensional manifold M with a metric d (not necessarily Riemannian). We will only consider the case where M is homeomorphic to S2 or S3 and the metric is Riemannian. There is a natural isometric embedding (in the metric space sense!) i:M  →  L∞(M) defined by i(x)(  ·  ) = dM(x,  ·  ). The filling radius is the infimum of r such that i(M) bounds in the tubular neighborhood Tr(i(M)) in the sense that [formula] vanishes in [formula]. We will represent a filling as continuous map σ:Σ  →  Tr(i(M)) from an n + 1-dimensional simplicial complex Σ such that σ|∂Σ:∂Σ  →  i(M) represents a generator in [formula].

We note that for any fixed ε > 0 by taking Barycentric subdivisions as needed we may assume that the σ-image of any simplex has diameter less than ε in L∞(X).

We note that there can be no continuous map f:Σ  →  i(X) which agrees with σ on ∂Σ since σ|∂Σ represents a generator of the top homology (so is not a boundary). Our proof of Theorem [\ref=fill2] will be by contradiction. We assume that Fillrad(g) is small, take a filling σ:Σ  →  L∞(M) as above, and show that σ:∂Σ  →  i(M) extends to a continuous f:Σ  →  i(M) giving the desired contradiction. Our proof of Theorem [\ref=fill3] uses a similar contradiction.

We use the notation Si(Σ) to denote the i-skeleton of a simplicial complex Σ. For each i = 0,1,2,...,n + 1 We will let {Δij} denote the set of i simplices in the n + 1 dimensional simplicial complex Σ. For each i-simplex Δij we let Gij be the connected graph (i.e. 1-complex) [formula] is a face of Δn + 1k}. By taking Barycentric subdivisions if needed we can assume that any two simplices intersect in a single (possibly empty) common face. Then we see that H1(Gij) is generated by the boundaries of the 2-simplices that are faces of the n + 1 simplices in the above union, since Van Kampen's theorem implies that the two complex [formula] is a face of Δn + 1k} is simply connected.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=fill2]

(of Theorem [\ref=fill2]) Let ε > 0 and choose a filling σ:Σ  →  L∞(S2,g) of (S2,g) in the Fillrad(g) + ε tubular neighborhood of S2  ⊂  L∞(S2,g) (we will confuse S2 with i(S2) since i is an isometric embedding). By taking subdivisions we can assume that diam(σ(Δ3k)) < ε for each Δ3k∈Σ. We will prove the theorem as suggested in the previous section by showing that if [formula] then we can find a continuous map f:Σ  →  S2 extending the map σ|∂Σ. We choose ε so small that [formula]

Step1: The 0 and 1 Skeletons

We define f on the 0-skeleton, S0(Σ), of Σ by mapping each 0 simplex v to a point f(v) on i(S2) closest to σ(v), hence

[formula]

In particular, f takes 0-simplices in the boundary to the same point as σ does. We note that if two vertices v1 and v2 are the endpoints of an edge then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We define f to map each nonboundary Δ1i∈S1(Σ) to a minimizing geodesic between the f image of the endpoints, hence the length L(Δ1i) satisfies [formula]. For Δ1i on the boundary, we let f|Δ1i  =  σ|Δ1i and hence Diam(f(Δ1i)) < ε.

Step 2: The 2 skeleton

We now extend f to S2(Σ). We note that [formula], for otherwise there would be a point x∈f(G2j) such that A(x)∈f(G2j) but this cannot happen since step 1 guarantees that the diameter of G2j is less than D(g,A).

We can thus extend f to S2(Σ) in such a way that we have

[formula]

Note that for boundary simplices, Δ2j, this will hold when we take f|Δ2j  =  σ|Δ2j by the triangle inequality.

Step 3: The 3 skeleton

Now for every Δ3k in Σ the previous step guarantees that

[formula]

Hence, since f|∂Δ3k misses a point, we can extend f to Δ3k.

This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=fill3]

Throughout this section S3 will be endowed with a fixed Riemannian metric g and an antipodal map A:S3  →  S3.

We will proceed analogously to the proof of Theorem [\ref=fill2]. However, in this case we will get our contradiction by finding a singular chain in S3 whose boundary is σ restricted to ∂Σ. We will do this one skeleton at a time, associating to each simplex Δji a singular simplicial chain cji whose boundary ∂cji corresponds to the already defined chain associated to ∂Δji (i.e. if ∂Δji  =  Σk( - 1)α(i,k)Δj - 1k then ∂cji  =  Σk( - 1)α(i,k)cj - 1k). We do this while associating simplices Δji of ∂Σ to the chain consisting only of σ applied to Δji.

Let ε > 0 and choose a filling σ of (S3,g) in the Fillrad(g) + ε tubular neighborhood of S3  ⊂  L∞(S3,g). By taking subdivisions we can assume that diam(F(Δ4l)) < ε for each Δ4l∈Σ. We will prove the theorem by showing that if [formula] then we find a chain as above extending σ|∂Σ. We choose ε so small that [formula]. During the rest of the argument we will associate boundary simplices to themselves without explicitly mentioning this special case. The arguments for these simplices will always follow from the other arguments along with the fact that the diameters are bounded by ε.

Step1: The 0 and 1 Skeletons

We define the 0-chains and 1-chains, c0i and c1i, associated to the 0-skeleton, S0(Σ), and the 1-skeleton, S1(Σ) of Σ just as before; i.e. by mapping each 0 simplex to a closest point on S3, and mapping each edge in the one skeleton to a minimizing geodesic between the endpoints. Hence the length of the image of a 1 simplex is less than [formula]. We can assume (by small moves) that 0-chains of distinct vertices of Σ are distinct and that the geodesic segments only intersect each other at endpoints.

Step 2: The 2 skeleton

Now consider a two simplex Δ2j of Σ. Let 2j be the embedded geodesic graph in S3 which is the union of the geodesic segments that correspond to the edges of G2j. We know that the support of ∂c2j (i.e. a geodesic triangle) does not intersect A((2j)) since in fact 2j does not intersect A((2j)), for if so there would be an x∈2j such that A(x) is also in 2j. But this can't happen because the diameter of 2j is [formula]

We claim that ∂c2j represents zero in H1(S3 - A(2k)). Alexander duality along with the fact that H1(2j) is generated by {∂c2k|Δ2k and Δ2j lie in a common 4-simplex} says that we need only show that L(∂c2j,A(∂c2k)) = 0 for each such c2k. So assume that [formula]. Since Δ2k and Δ2j lie in a common 4-simplex they share at least one vertex and hence we let γ be the closed simplicial curve (of combinatorial length 6) which is just ∂Δ21 followed by Δ2k. We let [formula] be the corresponding closed piecewise geodesic curve in 2j of length [formula] (which of course does not intersect A()). By the definition of L(g,A) we see that L(,A()) is zero as are L(∂c2j,A(∂c2j)) and L(∂c2k,A(∂c2k)). On the other hand

[formula]

and hence L(∂c2j,A(∂c2k)) =  - L(∂c2k,A(∂c2j)). But since A2 = id and A preserves orientation (since it is fixed point free) we have

[formula]

and the claim follows.

Thus we can define a 2-chain c2j whose boundary is ∂c2j and whose support is contained in S3 - A(2j).

Step 3: the 3 and 4 skeleta

Let Δ3i be a 3-simplex in Σ. For each 2-face Δ2k the support of c2k lies in S3 - A(2k)  ⊂  S3 - A(3i) (since 3i  ⊂  2k). Thus we have already defined the cycle ∂c3i in such a way that its support is in S3 - A(3i) and since by Alexander duality H3(S3 - A(3i)) = 0 we can find a chain c3i with boundary ∂c3i whose support also lies in S3 - A(3i). Thus we can extend to the 3 skeleton.

Now for Δ4i a 4-simplex of Σ we have now defined the cycle ∂c4i in such a way that its support is in S3 - A(4i). Since the support of ∂c4i misses a point of S3 there is a c4i whose boundary is ∂c4i.
