Duality Invariant Born-Infeld Lagrangians

In this note we prove the conjecture made in [\cite=BMZ] [\cite=ABMZ] regarding the form of [formula] or U(n,n) duality invariant Born-Infeld Lagrangians. See [\cite=ABMZ] for a more extensive list of references regarding the duality invariance of Born-Infeld theory. In [\cite=BMZ] [\cite=ABMZ], inspired by [\cite=RT], we exploited the fact that the square root in the U(1) gauge group Born-Infeld Lagrangian can be eliminated using auxiliary fields. In the auxiliary field formulation one can generalize the theory to a higher rank abelian gauge group U(1)2n such that the duality group becomes U(n,n). One complication discussed in [\cite=BMZ] [\cite=ABMZ] is that one has to introduce complex gauge fields. However in [\cite=ABMZ] we also showed that after the elimination of the auxiliary fields one can impose a reality condition which preserves an [formula] subgroup of the duality group. For higher order matrices the elimination of the auxiliary fields is more complicated since the algebraic second order equation for the auxiliary field becomes a matrix second order equation.

The Born-Infeld Lagrangian introduced in [\cite=BMZ] [\cite=ABMZ] with auxiliary fields is given by

[formula]

where α and β are given by the following Lorentz invariant hermitian matrices

[formula]

Here [formula] is the Hodge dual of F and a bar denotes complex conjugation. The auxiliary fields χ and λ are n dimensional complex matrices. For simplicity we have set the field S to the constant value i since as discussed in [\cite=ABMZ] it can be easily reintroduced. With this choice the duality group reduces to the maximal compact subgroup U(n)  ×  U(n) of U(n,n).

The equation of motion obtained by varying λ gives an equation for χ

[formula]

and after solving this equation the Lagrangian reduces to

[formula]

Let χ  =  χ1 + iχ2 where χ1 and χ2 are hermitian. The anti-hermitian part of ([\ref=EQ]) implies χ2  =  β , thus [formula]. This can be used to eliminate χ from ([\ref=EQ]) and obtain a quadratic equation for [formula]. Following [\cite=ABMZ], it is convenient to define [formula] which then satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

The Lagrangian is then

[formula]

If the degree of the matrices is one, we can solve for Q in the quadratic equation ([\ref=Qeq]) and then ([\ref=Lag]) reduces to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian.

For matrices of higher degree, equation ([\ref=Qeq]) can be solved perturbatively and by analyzing the first few terms in the expansion we conjectured in [\cite=BMZ] [\cite=ABMZ] that the trace of Q can be obtained as follows. First, find the perturbative solution of equation ([\ref=Qeq]) assuming p and q commute. Then the trace of Q is the trace of the symmetrized expansion

[formula]

where the symmetrization operator S will be discussed in the next section. In the appendix of [\cite=ABMZ] we have also guessed an explicit formula for the coefficients of the expansion of the trace of Q

[formula]

In the next section we will prove that for a unilateral matrix equation of order N, the perturbative solution is a sum of terms which are symmetrized in all the matrix coefficients and of terms which are commutators. Since equation ([\ref=Qeq]) is a unilateral matrix equation the trace of Q will be symmetrized in the matrix coefficients q and p - q. Since this is equivalent to symmetrization in q and p our conjecture ([\ref=CONJ]) follows.

Unilateral Matrix Equations

In this section we prove a theorem regarding certain solutions of unilateral matrix equations. These are Nth order matrix equations for the variable φ with matrix coefficients Ai which are all on one side, e.g. on the left

[formula]

The matrices are all square and of arbitrary degree. We may equally consider the Ai's as generators of an associative algebra, and φ an element of this algebra which satisfies the above equation. We will prove that the formal perturbative solution of ([\ref=eqphi]) around zero is a sum of symmetrized polynomials in the Ai and of terms which are commutators. The same is true for all the positive powers of the solution.

By repeatedly inserting φ from the left hand side of ([\ref=eqphi]) into the right hand side we obtain the perturbative expansion of φ as a sum

[formula]

where each DM is a product of the Ai matrices. Any ordered product of these matrices will be referred to as a word. However not every word appears in the perturbative expansion of φ. We reserve the letter D for words that do appear.

Next we obtain the condition that a word must satisfy in order to be in the expansion. First note that because of ([\ref=eqphi]) any word DM can be written as the following product

[formula]

for some value of s, where the DMi's are also words in the expansion. Conversely, if all the DMi's are words in the expansion, DM defined in equation ([\ref=DM]) is also a word in the expansion. By iterating ([\ref=DM]) we obtain the following equivalent statement: for every splitting of DM into two words DM = W1W2 the second word can be written as a product of terms in the expansion of φ

[formula]

It is convenient to assign to every matrix a dimension d such that d(φ) =  - 1. Using ([\ref=eqphi]), the dimension of the matrix Ai is given by d(Ai) = i - 1 and d(DM) =  - 1. Then we obtain the following intrinsic characterization of a word in the expansion of φ. It is a word D such that for every splitting into two words D = W1W2, where W2 has at least one letter, we have

[formula]

Note that ([\ref=Dcond]) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a word to be in the expansion of φ .

Suppose that W is an arbitrary word such that d(W) =  - 1. Then, as we will show, there is a unique cyclic permutation D of W such that D is a term in the expansion of φ. Let us write [formula], where DN1 is the shortest word starting from the first letter such that d(DN1) =  - 1. DNi is defined in the same way, except we start from the first letter after the word DNi - 1. Finally W1 is whatever is left over. We use the notation DNi since they correspond to terms in the φ expansion. To see this, note that the total dimension of a word can increase or decrease when a letter is added on the right, but if it decreases it can only do so by one unit. This is when the letter added is A0. Combining this with the fact that DNi is the shortest word which satisfies d(DNi) =  - 1 then implies that if DNi is a product of two words the dimension of the first word is greater than or equal to zero. This is just the condition ([\ref=Dcond]). Then using the fact that d(W1) = k - 1 one can check that the cyclic permutation of W defined as [formula] satisfies ([\ref=Dcond]), thus it belongs to the expansion of φ. Note that all the other cyclic permutations lead to words that are not in the expansion. Assuming the converse implies that two distinct terms in the expansion can be related by a cyclic permutation. But this is impossible: if we write D = W1W2, then d(W1)  ≥  0 and thus d(W2)  ≤   - 1, so that its cyclic permutation W2W1 does not satisfy ([\ref=Dcond]). A similar argument can be used to show that all different cyclic permutations of a term in the expansion of φ lead to distinct words.

Consider the trace of the sum of all distinct words of dimension d =  - 1 and of order ai in Ai. We can group together all words that are cyclic permutations of each other, and replace each group by a single word with coefficient [formula]. Using the result of the previous paragraph, we can choose this word to satisfy ([\ref=Dcond]). Thus we have

[formula]

where the sum in the right hand side is over all distinct words of some fixed order {ai} and of dimension d(W) =  - 1.

We define the symmetrization operator S as a linear operator acting on monomials as

[formula]

where the sum is over distinct words of fixed order {ai}. Equivalently, a word can be symmetrized by averaging over all permutations of its letters. Not all permutations give distinct words and this accounts for the numerator on the right side of equation ([\ref=Sym]). The normalization of S is such that on commutative Ai's S acts as the identity.

Combining ([\ref=Distinct]) and ([\ref=Sym]), we can obtain the solution for the trace of φ to all orders

[formula]

where the sum is over all sets {ai} restricted to words of dimension d =  - 1 . More generally, if the Ai's are considered to be the generators of an associative algebra, we can replace the trace in ([\ref=trphi]) with the cyclic average operator which was defined in [\cite=ABMZ]. This is true since in the proof we only used the cyclic property of the trace which also holds for the cyclic average operator. Therefore, the solution φ can be written as a sum of symmetric polynomials and terms which are commutators. This is the statement we set out to prove. Notice that our derivation implies that the coefficients in ([\ref=trphi]) are all integers.

Using the same kind of arguments we used to derive equation ([\ref=trphi]), we can also prove that the trace of positive powers of φ is given by

[formula]

Furthermore we can write a generating function for ([\ref=trphir])

[formula]

On the right hand side of ([\ref=genr]) one must expand the logarithm and restrict the sum to words of negative dimension. Since d(φr) =  - r  we can obtain ([\ref=trphir]) by extracting the dimension d =  - r terms from the right hand side of ([\ref=genr]). Note that all the terms in the expansion of [formula] are automatically symmetrized.

It is possible to give a simple proof of ([\ref=genr]) without going through the combinatoric arguments above, which however give a construction of the solution and its powers themselves, not only their trace. First note that we can rewrite equation ([\ref=eqphi]) as

[formula]

The right hand side factorizes

[formula]

Under the trace we can use the fundamental property of the logarithm, even for noncommutative objects, and obtain

[formula]

Using d(Ak) = k - 1 and d(φ) =  - 1 we have d(Akφm) = k - m - 1 and we see that all the words in the argument of the first logarithm on the right hand side have semi-positive dimension. Since all the words in the expansion of the second term have negative dimension we obtain ([\ref=genr]).

If the coefficient AN is unity, we have the following identity for the symmetrization operator

[formula]

This is obviously true up to normalization; the normalization can be checked in the commutative case.

The trace of the solution of ([\ref=Qeq]) can now be obtained from ([\ref=trphi]) by taking N = 2 and setting A2 to unity. The restriction on the sum of ([\ref=trphi]) in this case reads a0  -  a2  =  1. The sum can then be rewritten

[formula]

Using φ  =  Q, A0  =  q, A1 = p - q, the combinatoric identity

[formula]

and the resummation identities

[formula]

one can show that ([\ref=Trphi]) reduces to ([\ref=pqLag]).

Discussion

After completing the first version of this paper [\cite=ABMZv1], where we only proved the symmetrization theorem for the trace of φ, we learned through private communications that A. Schwarz was developing another method [\cite=AS] of proving the theorem (for a slightly different, but related equation). Using his method he was able to show that the theorem is true for arbitrary powers of the solution. Inspired by this, we also extended the theorem, using our method, to positive powers of φ, see ([\ref=trphir]). In the process we discovered the simpler proof using the generating function ([\ref=genr]).
