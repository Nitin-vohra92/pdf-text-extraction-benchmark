Let us briefly describe the setting in which we are working. D denotes the set of all dyadic intervals contained in the unit interval. π:D  →  D denotes a permutation of the dyadic intervals. The operator induced by π is determined by the equation where hI denotes the L∞-normalised Haar function supported on the dyadic intervall I. The main result of this paper treats general permutations on BMO and on Lipschitz spaces. The condition on π which controlles the boundedness of Tπ is given in termes of the Carleson constant of collections of dyadic intervals. The proof of the general result given below is quite complicated. We start therefore by considering first a special class of permutation operators. To study these operators on Lp E.M. Semyonov introduced the parameter, where for example B* denotes the pointset coverd by the collection B

E.M Semyonov and B.Stöckert proved the following result.

If for every I∈D we have |π(I)| = |I| and K <   ∞   then for 2  ≤  p <   ∞   the operator Tπ is bounded on Lp

We will obtain this result from

If for every I∈D we have |π(I)| = |I| and K <   ∞   then the operator Tπ is bounded on dyadic-BMO

Proof: Recall that for formal series [formula] the dyadic - BMO norm is given by where the supremum is extended over all collections of dyadic intervals B. We fix now [formula] and obtain [formula]. Then choose B  ⊆  D such that By hypothesis this expression equals with Which equals trivially with The last expression is of course bounded by K||x||2BMO. This finishes the proof of Theorem2.

Remark: 1) For every permutation which satisfies |π(I)| = |(I)| there exist E  ⊆  D and x∈BMO for which the above chain of inequalities can be reversed. Hence for such permutations the condition K <   ∞   is implied by the boundedness of Tπ.

2) As Tπ is bounded on L2 we obtain from [\cite=JJ] Corollary2 p60 that Tπ is bounded on Lp for 2 < p <   ∞  . We thus obtained Theorem 1 from Theorem 2 by interpolation.

Up to this point we considered permutations which act on one level of the Haar system only. We now turn to arbitrary permutations.

To do this we need a scale invariant measure for the size of collections of dyadic Intervals B : the so called Carleson condition. This notion was studied and carefully analyzed by P.W. Jones in his work on the uniform approximation property of BMO.

B is said to satisfy the K-Carleson condition if

The infimum over all such K is called the Carleson constant of B and will be denoted CC(B)

max B denotes those intervals in B which are not contained in other intervals of B. As dyadic intervals are nested, the collection max B contains only pairwise disjoint dyadic intervals.

Let π:D  →  D be any permutation. The operator Tπ is an isomorphism on BMO if and only if there exists [formula] such that for all B  ⊂  D

[formula]

We will prove Theorem 3 by decomposing D so as to control the norm of Tπ on smaller parts. During the decomposition process we will collect additional information concerning the interaction of the small pieces. Each iteration step is based on

Let π:D  →  D be a permutation which satisfies the condition of Theorem 3 Then for any D(I)  ⊂  D with D(I)*  ⊂  I ,[formula], and x∈ BMO we obtain a decomposition [formula]

where G(I) satisfies

[formula]

and S(I) satisfies

[formula]

Consequently for N(I)  =  π- 1(maxπ(D(I)) and [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Proof: We define

[formula]

and let [formula] The defining inequality for J∈G(I) implies that This expression has ||x||2BMOK|π(D(I))*| as upper bound. It remains to analyze S(I): by definition of S(I) we get The sum on the right hand side is dominated by the Carleson constant of π(maxS(I)), which by assumtion is bounded by M times the Carleson constant of maxS(I) . However maxS(I) beeing a collection of pairwise satisfies the 1 Carleson condition. Summing up we obtain The collection max π(D(I)) like any other collection of disjoint dyadic intervals has Carleson constant equal to one. Hence π- 1(maxπ(D(I))) satisfies the M Carleson condition. In particular for L∈maxS(I) Let us combine this estimate with the previous analysis of S(I) to describe the size of O(I). The generations of the index set O(I) are used to form a stopping time decomposition of S(I).

We first recall how generations are formed: let G0(O(I)) be max O(I). Having defined [formula] we put

[formula]

We now form the crucial decomposition of S(I):

For [formula] and L∈Gk(O(I)) we define [formula]

Comment 1) Consider the following identity

[formula]

In view of Lemma1 the sum indexed by G(I) admits a good upper bound. We shifted the bad behavior of the permutation into the sum indexed by O(I) However we used the hypothesis to show that this index set is geometrically small compared to I. This remark indicates that Lemma1 permits us to show that a repeated application of the identity defines a converging algorithm.

2) One's first idea might be to choose maxS(I) as index set O(I). However when one tries to prove convergence for the associated decomposition procedure one meets serious technical difficulties. The way to get around these complications is to choose an index set which contains information about maxS(I) and π- 1(maxπ(D(I)).

The necessity of our condition is implied by the following relation between the Carleson condition and BMO : [formula]. The rest of the paper is used to show that the condition of Theorem3 is also sufficient. We first choose J0∈D such that [formula] is bounded by We now let B  =  π- 1({J:π(J)  ⊂  π(J0)}) and O0  =   max B For I∈O0 we put D(I)  =  {J∈B:J  ⊂  I} having produced [formula] and [formula] we choose I∈Ol and D(I)∈Dl. Lemma1 is now applied to D(I) and we obtain G(I), S(I), N(I) , and O(I). Finally S(I) is decomposed according to the Definition2 . This gives us {D(L)  ⊂  S(I):L∈O(I)}. Doing this for each I∈Ol allowes us to define We thereby completed the induction step. The next two claims describe the behaviour of our construction. From now on, K denotes any number bigger than 4M2

[formula] satisfies the 2 Carleson condition

Proof: Fix I∈Ok0. If J∈Ok, and J  ⊂  I then by construction we obtain k  ≥  k0. Applying the estimates of Lemma1 we obtain for k  ≥  k0 For I∈Ok0 Invoking the observation above we obtain for this sum the following majorization:

[formula] satisfies the (3M) Carleson condition.

Proof: When we look back at the construction we see that each dyadic interval lies in at most one of the collections N(J). Fix now I∈N. Hence I∈Nk0 for some k0 , and there exists exactly one dyadic interval P such that I∈N(P). This remark gives the representation We thus obtain the following identity: The first summand is simply estimated by CC(N(P)) which in turn is less than M.The second term is majorized by Having proved claim2,we resume the proof of Theorem3.

We know now that N satisfies the 3M Carleson condition. Observe that [formula] Therefore By hypothesis on π we get CC(π(N))  ≤  MCC(N). Recall next that {G(I):I∈O} is a decomposition of B. We thus obtain the following final estimates.

[formula]

[formula]

As we observed above this sum is bounded from above by 3M2||x||2BM

This proves that Tπ is a bounded operator on BMO. As the hypothesis of the theorem is symmetric in π and π- 1 we conclude that Tπ-1 = T- 1π is bounded as well.

The dyadic BMO condition appears as a natural limit of some Lipschitz condition for martingales. We describe subsequenty an extension of our main result to Lipschitz spaces. l For φ∈L2 say and 0 < p  ≤  1 the Lipschitz condition assumes the form where φI denotes the meanvalue of φ over I. The particular interest in these class of functions stems from a duality relation due to C. Herz,[\cite=HE], which generalizes C.Feffermans duality theorem. Herz's theorem identifies [formula] with the dual space of dyadic Hp(0 < p  ≤  1).

We shall now discuss permutations of Haar functions which are normalised in [formula]. The norm of the L∞ normalised functions hI in [formula] equals [formula]. Hence the operator induced by the permutation π:D  →  D is given by the relation It is useful to observe that the [formula] norm of [formula] can be expressed in terms of the coefficients aI. In fact we obtain This formula suggests how to extend properly the notion of Carleson - constant.

For a collection B of dyadic intervals, the Carleson p-constant is given by It will be denoted by CCp(B)

Our extension of Theorem 3 reads now as follows

Let π:D  →  D be a permutation. Let 0 < p  ≤  1. The operator Tp,π is an isomorphism on [formula] if and only if there exists M∈  +   such that for every B  ⊆  D

The proof of theorem4 follows the pattern explained above. The first step is again given by the following

Let π:D  →  D be a permutation which satisfies the condition of Theorem 4 Then for any D(I)  ⊂  D with D(I)*  ⊂  I ,[formula], and [formula] we obtain a decomposition [formula]

where G(I) satisfies

[formula]

and S(I) satisfies

[formula]

Consequently for N(I)  =  π- 1(maxπ(D(I)) and [formula] we obtain

[formula]

Proof: We define

[formula]

and let [formula] The defining inequality for J∈G(I) implies that This expression has

[formula]

as upper bound. It remains to analyze S(I): by definition of S(I) we get The sum on the right hand side is dominated by the Carleson p constant of π(maxS(I)), which by assumtion is bounded by M times the Carleson p constant of maxS(I) . This in turn is bounded by one. We obtained: The collection max π(D(I)) has Carleson p constant equal to one.

Hence π- 1(maxπ(D(I))) satisfies the M Carleson p condition. In particular for L∈maxS(I) This estimate and the previous analysis of S(I) gives an upper bound for the size of O(I).

Proof of Theorem 4 The necessity of our condition is implied by the following fact

[formula]

We show now that the condition of Theorem4 is also sufficient. We first choose J0∈D such that [formula] is bounded by We now let B  =  π- 1({J:π(J)  ⊂  π(J0)}). Using Lemma2 we form as in the proof of Theorem3 the collections O,N, {G(I):I∈O} and {D(I):I∈O} such that :

CCp(N)  ≤  3M

{G(I):I∈O} is a decomposition of B

[formula]

As [formula] we obtain By hypothesis on π we get CCp(π(N))  ≤  MCCp(N). Moreover {G(I):I∈O} is a decomposition of B. We thus obtain

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We observed already that this sum is bounded by [formula]

This proves that Tp,π is a bounded operator on [formula]. Repeating this procedure with π replaced by π- 1 wwe are able to conclude that Tp,π-1 = T- 1p,π is bounded as well.

In view of the above mentioned duality results due to C. Herz and C. Fefferman the transposed operator of Tp,π, (0 < p  ≤  1) is given by the operator Sp,π defined by π- 1 acting on Hp normalised Haar functions. More precisely Sp,π:Hp  →  Hp is given by the relation.

[formula]

An equivalent formulation of Theorem 4 is thus given by

Let π:D  →  D be a permutation. Let 0 < p  ≤  1. The operator Sp,π is an isomorphism on dyadic Hp if and only if there exists M∈  +   such that for every B  ⊆  D
