Number of Least Area Planes in Gromov Hyperbolic 3-Spaces

Introduction

Let X be a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric, and S2∞(X) be the sphere at infinity of X. Let Γ be a given simple closed curve in S2∞(X). The asymptotic Plateau problem asks the existence of a least area plane Σ in X with asymptotic boundary Γ, i.e. ∂∞Σ  =  Γ. The author gave a positive answer to this question, and showed the existence of such least area plane asymptotic to given curve in S2∞(X) in [\cite=Co1].

For the analogous problem for [formula], Michael Anderson showed the existence of a least area plane [formula] asymptotic to given simple closed curve [formula] in [\cite=A1], [\cite=A2]. Later, by using topological techniques instead of geometric measure theory, Gabai got a similar result for hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric in [\cite=Ga].

On the other hand, on the number of the least area planes for a given simple closed curve in the asymptotic sphere, there are a few results so far. In [\cite=A1], Anderson showed that if the given asymptotic boundary [formula] bounds a convex domain in [formula], then there exists a unique least area plane in [formula] . Then, Hardt and Lin generalized this result to the simple closed curves bounding star shaped domains in [formula] in [\cite=HL]. Recently, the author showed that a generic simple closed curve in [formula] bounds a unique least area plane in [formula] in [\cite=Co2], [\cite=Co4].

For the number of least area planes in a Gromov hyperbolic spaces spanning a given curve in the asymptotic boundary, there is no result so far. In this paper, we will generalize the results in [\cite=Co4] to Gromov hyperbolic 3-spaces with cocompact metric. We will use similar techniques, but there are more technicalities to overcome because of Gromov hyperbolic space [\cite=Co3]. Our main result is as follows:

Theorem 3.3. Let X be a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric. Let A be the space of simple closed curves in S2∞(X) and A'  ⊂  A be the subspace containing the simple closed curves in S2∞(X) bounding a unique least area plane in X. Then, A' is generic in A, i.e. A - A' is a set of first category.

This is the first result in this direction for Gromov hyperbolic spaces. The techniques are very general, and they can be applied to many similar settings. Furthermore, there are interesting applications of this result. Namely, for a generic curve as above, the following conjecture is true.

Disjoint Planes Conjecture: Let Γ1,Γ2 be simple closed curves in S2∞(X). If Γ1 and Γ2 do not cross each other (i.e. They are the boundaries of disjoint open regions in S2∞(X) ), then any distinct least area planes Σ1,Σ2 in X with asymptotic boundary Γ1,Γ2 are disjoint.

With this conjecture, it can be showed that for a genuine lamination Λ in M, If [formula] has continuous extension property, then by replacing the leaves if [formula] with least area planes [formula], we get a genuine lamination Δ in M with minimal leaves. Hence, if the induced curves in S2∞(X) are generic, with the main result, it is possible to modify a given genuine Λ to the one with minimal leaves Δ in M. Of course, it is possible to do same for any essential 2-dimensional object in a Gromov hyperbolic 3-manifold.

The organization of the paper is as follows: In the next section we will cover some basic results which will be used in the following sections. In section 3, we will prove the main result of the paper. Then in section 4, we will show some applications of the main result. Finally in section 5, we will have some final remarks.

Preliminaries

A 3-manifold M is called Gromov hyperbolic manifold if its fundamental group π1(M) is a word hyperbolic (or Gromov hyperbolic) group [\cite=Gr]. We call X as Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric if X is the universal cover of a Riemannian closed orientable irreducible Gromov hyperbolic 3-manifold M where the metric on X is induced by M. By [\cite=BM], X is homeomorphic to an open ball in [formula]. Since X is Gromov hyperbolic 3-space, it has a natural compactification [formula] where [formula]. Here, ∂∞X is the sphere at infinity S2∞(X), and a point on S2∞(X) corresponds to an equivalence class of infinite rays in X where two rays are equivalent if they are asymptotic.

We call a disk D as a least area disk if D has the smallest area among the disks with the same boundary ∂D. A plane is a subset of X with the topological type of a disk, and complete with the induced path metric from X. We call a plane P as a least area plane if any subdisk in the plane P is a least area disk.

A codimension-1 lamination σ in X is a foliation of a closed subset of X with 2-manifolds (leaves) such that X is covered by charts of the form I2  ×  I where a leave passes through a chart in a slice of the form I2  ×  {p} for p∈I. Here and later, we abuse notation by letting σ also denote the underlying space of its lamination.

The sequence {Di} of embedded disks in a Riemannian manifold X converges to the lamination σ if

i) For any convergent sequence {xni} in X with xni∈Dni where ni is a strictly increasing sequence, lim xni∈σ.

ii) For any x∈σ, there exists a sequence {xi} with xi∈Di and lim xi  =  x such that there exist embeddings fi:D2  →  Di which converge in the C∞  -topology to a smooth embedding f:D2  →  Lx, where xi∈fi(Int(D2)), and Lx is the leaf of σ through x, and x∈f(Int(D2)).

We call such a lamination σ as D2-limit lamination.

[\cite=Co1] Let Γ be a simple closed curve in S2∞(X) where X is a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric. Then there exists a D2-limit lamination σ  ⊂  X by least area planes spanning Γ.

The following lemma is often called Meeks-Yau exchange roundoff trick.

[\cite=MY] If D1 and D2 are least area disks in a manifold M such that [formula] and [formula], then [formula].

Generic Uniqueness of Least Area Planes

In this section, we will prove that the space of simple closed curves in S2∞(X) bounding a unique least area plane in X is generic in the space of simple closed curves in S2∞(X).

The short outline of the technique is the following: Let Γ0 be a simple closed curve in S2∞(X). First, we will show that either there exists a unique least area plane Σ0 in X with ∂∞Σ0  =  Γ0, or there exist two disjoint least area planes Σ+0,Σ-0 in X with ∂∞Σ±0  =  Γ0.

Now, take a small neighborhood N(Γ0)  ⊂  S2∞(X) which is an annulus. Then foliate N(Γ0) by simple closed curves {Γt} where t∈( - ε,ε), i.e. N(Γ0)≃Γ  ×  ( - ε,ε). By the above fact, for any Γt either there exist a unique least area plane Σt, or there are two least area planes Σ±t disjoint from each other. Also, since these are least area planes, if they have disjoint asymptotic boundary, then they are disjoint by Meeks-Yau exchange roundoff trick. This means, if t1 < t2, then Σt1 is disjoint and below from Σt2 in X. Consider this collection of least area planes. Note that for curves Γt bounding more than one least area plane, we have a canonical region Nt in X between the disjoint least area planes Σ±t.

Now, N(Γ) separates S2∞(X) into two parts, and take a proper line β  ⊂  X which is asymptotic to two points belongs to these two different parts. This line is transverse to the collection of these least area planes asymptotic to the curves in {Γt}. Also, a finite segment of this line intersects the entire collection. Let the length of this finite segment be C.

Now, the idea is to consider the thickness of the neighborhoods Nt assigned to the asymptotic curves {Γt}. Let st be the length of the segment It of β between Σ+t and Σ-t, which is the width of Nt assigned to Γt. Then, the curves Γt bounding more than one least area planes have positive width, and contributes to total thickness of the collection, and the curves bounding unique least area plane has 0 width and do not contribute to the total thickness. Since [formula], the total thickness is finite. This implies for only countably many t∈( - ε,ε), st > 0, i.e. Γt bounds more than one least area plane. For the remaining uncountably many t∈( - ε,ε), st = 0, and there exist a unique least area plane for those t. This proves the space of Jordan curves of uniqueness is dense in the space of Jordan curves in S2∞(X). Then, by using similar arguments, we will show this space is not only dense, but also generic.

First, we will show that if two least area planes have disjoint asymptotic boundaries, then they are disjoint.

Let Γ1 and Γ2 be two disjoint simple closed curves in S2∞(X). If Σ1 and Σ2 are least area planes in X with ∂∞Σi  =  Γi, then Σ1 and Σ2 are disjoint, too.

The following lemma is very essential for our technique. Mainly, the lemma says that for any given simple closed curve Γ in S2∞(X), either there exists a unique least area plane Σ in X asymptotic to Γ, or there exist two least area planes Σ± in X which are asymptotic to Γ and disjoint from each other.

Let X be a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric, and let Γ be a simple closed curve in S2∞(X). Then either there exists a unique least area plane Σ in X with ∂∞Σ  =  Γ, or there are two canonical disjoint extremal least area planes Σ+ and Σ- in X with ∂∞Σ±  =  Γ. Moreover, any least area plane Σ' with ∂∞Σ' = Γ is disjoint from Σ±, and it is captured in the region bounded by Σ+ and Σ- in X.

Now, we are going to prove the main theorem of the paper. This theorem says that for a generic simple closed curve in the asymptotic sphere of a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space, there exists a unique least area plane.

Let X be a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric, and let A be the space of simple closed curves in S2∞(X). Let A'  ⊂  A be the subspace containing the simple closed curves in S2∞(X) bounding a unique least area plane in X. Then, A' is generic in A, i.e. A - A' is a set of first category.

Claim 2: A' is generic in A, i.e. A - A' is a set of first category.

Hence, this proves that for a generic simple closed curve in the asymptotic sphere of a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric, there exist a unique least area plane spanning the curve. In the next section, we will give some applications of this result.

Applications

In this section, we will show that, if a simple closed curve Γ in S2∞(X), bounds a unique least area plane ΣΓ in X, where X is a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric, then for any other simple closed curve α not crossing Γ in SX, then any least area planes Σα is disjoint from ΣΓ. In other words, the following Disjoint Planes Conjecture is true if one of the curves bounds a unique least area plane.

Disjoint Planes Conjecture: Let Γ1,Γ2 be simple closed curves in S2∞(X), where X is a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric. If Γ1 and Γ2 do not cross each other (i.e. They are the boundaries of disjoint open regions in S2∞(X) ), then any distinct least area planes Σ1,Σ2 in X with asymptotic boundary Γ1,Γ2 are disjoint.

Now, we will prove that if one of the curves in the conjecture bounds a unique least area plane, then the conjecture is true.

Let Γ1,Γ2 be as in the Disjoint Planes Conjecture. Let Γ1 bounds a unique least area plane in X. Then, the Disjoint Planes Conjecture is true for Γ1 and Γ2.

By combining the above result with Theorem 3.3, we get the following corollary.

The Disjoint Planes Conjecture is generically true.

Now, by using the techniques in [\cite=Co1], as described in Remark 4.1, for a genuine lamination Λ in a 3-manifold M, with the corollary above, it is generically possible to modify it without changing the metric of M so that the leaves of the new lamination Λ' are minimal. Similar, construction works for incompressible surfaces in Gromov hyperbolic 3-manifolds, to. Basically, this corollary implies that it is generically possible to construct least area representative of any essential 2-dimensional object in a Gromov hyperbolic 3-manifold.

Final Remarks

In this paper, we showed that for a generic simple closed curve in the asymptotic sphere of a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric, there is a unique least area plane spanning the curve in the space. This is the first result in this setting, while for the analogous question in [formula], there are many significant results like [\cite=A2], [\cite=HL], [\cite=Co2], [\cite=Co4].

The next question is whether there exist simple closed curves in S2∞(X) which bound more than one least area planes in X, where X is a Gromov hyperbolic 3-space with cocompact metric. In the special case, when [formula], we showed the existence of such curves in [formula] bounding more than one least area plane in [formula] in [\cite=Co5]. By using the techniques in [\cite=Co5], one can easily show that if there exist a complete minimal surface S with some genus in X asymptotic to a simple closed curve γ0 in S2∞(X), then there is a curve γt0 in S2∞(X) bounding more than one least area plane in X where {γt} is a foliation of S2∞(X) with simple closed curves, i.e. [formula] (γ- 1,γ1 are singular leaves). The idea is by assuming the uniqueness for all curves, one can foliate X with {Σt} where Σt is a least area plane with ∂∞Σt  =  Γt by using the Lemma 3.1, i.e. [formula]. Now, S is a minimal surface with ∂∞S = γ0. Since S has some genus, it cannot be a leave in the foliation {Σt}. So, there must be a tangential intersection with a leaf Σt1. This is a contradiction by maximum principle for minimal surfaces [\cite=HS].

On the other hand, in section 4, we gave an application of this generic uniqueness result by applying it to the Disjoint Planes Conjecture. As described in Remark 4.1, this conjecture has many important applications in 3-manifold topology by combining it with the techniques developed in [\cite=Co1]. As Theorem 4.1 shows, to finish this conjecture, the only case needs to be ruled out is when Γ1,Γ2 are not crossing each other and they both bounds more than one least area planes, i.e. ∂∞Σ±i  =  Γi. One idea to rule out this case is to "foliate" the region between Γ1 and Γ2 in S2∞(X), by simple closed curves Γt where 1  ≤  t  ≤  2, such that [formula] for any 1  ≤  t,s  ≤  2. Hence, one get the two families of the least area planes {Σ+t} and {Σ-t} where ∂∞Σ±t  =  Γt (Otherwise, if one curve in the "foliation" Γt0 bounds a unique least area plane, then this plane will be a barrier between Σ±1 and Σ±2 ). Then the idea is to analyze the intersections of these families of least area planes in order to get a contradiction by using the maximum principle for minimal surfaces.
