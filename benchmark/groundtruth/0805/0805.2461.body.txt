hook lengths and 3-cores

Introduction and statement of results

In their work on random partitions and Seiberg-Witten theory, Nekrasov and Okounkov [\cite=NO] proved the following striking formula:

[formula]

Here the sum is over integer partitions λ, |λ| denotes the integer partitioned by λ, and H(λ) denotes the multiset of classical hooklengths associated to a partition λ. In a recent preprint, the first author [\cite=Han1] has obtained an extension of ([\ref=NOformula]), one which has a specialization which gives the classical generating function

[formula]

for the number of t-core partitions of n. Recall that a partition is a t-core if none of its hook lengths are multiples of t.

In the course of his work, the first author [\cite=Han2] formulated a number of conjectures concerning hook lengths of partitions. One of these conjectures is related to classical identities of Jacobi. For positive integers t, he compared the functions Ft2(x) and Ct(x). If t = 1, we obviously have that

[formula]

For t = 2, by two famous identities of Jacobi, we have In both pairs of power series one sees that the non-zero coefficients are supported on the same terms. For t = 3, we then have

[formula]

and

[formula]

It is clear that b(n) = c3(n).

In accordance with the elementary observations when t = 1 and 2, one notices that the non-zero coefficients of F9(x) and C3(x) appear to be supported on the same terms. Based on substantial numerical evidence, the first author made the following conjecture.

Conjecture 4.6. (Conjecture 4.6 of [\cite=Han2])    Assuming the notation above, we have that a(n) = 0 if and only if b(n) = 0.

The obvious generalization of Conjecture 4.6 and the examples above is not true for t = 4. In particular, one easily finds that The coefficient of x53 vanishes in F16(x) and is non-zero in C4(x).

Here we prove that Conjecture 4.6 is true. We have the following theorem.

Assuming the notation above, we have that a(n) = 0 if and only if b(n) = 0. Moreover, we have that a(n) = b(n) = 0 precisely for those non-negative n for which [formula] is odd for some prime [formula].

As usual, [formula] denotes the power of a prime p dividing an integer N.

Theorem [\ref=hanconjecture] shows that a(n) = b(n) = 0 in a systematic way. The vanishing coefficients are associated to primes [formula]. If [formula] has the property that [formula] is odd, then we have For example, since [formula], we have that a(3) = b(3) = 0.

As an immediate corollary, we have the following.

For positive integers N, we have that if and only if there are no 3-core partitions of N.

Theorem [\ref=hanconjecture] implies that "almost all" of the a(n) and b(n) are 0. More precisely, we have the following.

Assuming the notation above, we have that

Proofs

It is convenient to renormalize the functions a(n) and b(n) using the series

[formula]

and

[formula]

Here we have that [formula], the upper-half of the complex plane, and we let q: = e2πiz. We make these changes since A(z) and B(z) are examples of two special types of modular forms (for background on modular forms, see [\cite=Bump] [\cite=Iwaniec] [\cite=Miyake] [\cite=OnoCBMS]). The modularity of these two series follows easily from the properties of Dedekind's eta-function

[formula]

The proofs of Theorem [\ref=hanconjecture] and Corollary [\ref=lacunarity] shall rely on exact formulas we derive for the numbers a*(n) and b*(n).

Exact formulas for a*(n)

The modular form A(z) given by is in S4(Γ0(9)), the space of weight 4 cusp forms on Γ0(9). This space is one dimensional (see Section 1.2.3 in [\cite=OnoCBMS]). Therefore, every cusp form in the space is a multiple of A(z). It turns out that A(z) is a form with complex multiplication.

We now briefly recall the notion of a newform with complex multiplication (for example, see Chapter 12 of [\cite=Iwaniec] or Section 1.2 of [\cite=OnoCBMS], [\cite=Ribet]). Let D < 0 be the fundamental discriminant of an imaginary quadratic field [formula]. Let OK be the ring of integers of K, and let [formula] be the usual Kronecker character associated to K. Let k  ≥  2, and let c be a Hecke character of K with exponent k - 1 and conductor [formula], a non-zero ideal of OK. By definition, this means that is a homomorphism, where [formula] denotes the group of fractional ideals of K prime to [formula]. In particular, this means that for α∈K× for which [formula]. To c we naturally associate a Dirichlet character ωc defined, for every integer n coprime to [formula], by Given this data, we let

[formula]

where [formula] varies over the ideals of OK prime to [formula], and where [formula] is the usual ideal norm. It is known that [formula] is a normalized newform.

Using this theory, we obtain the following theorem.

Assume the notation above. Then the following are true:

If p = 3 or [formula] is prime, then a*(p) = 0.

If [formula] is prime, then

[formula]

where x and y are integers for which p = x2 + 3y2 with [formula].

It is a classical fact that every prime [formula] is of the form x2 + 3y2. Moreover, there is a unique pair of positive integers x and y for which x2 + 3y2 = p. Therefore, the formula for a*(p) is well defined.

There is a form with complex multiplication in S4(Γ0(9)). Following the recipe above, it is obtained by letting k = 4, [formula] and [formula]. For primes p, the coefficients of qp in this form agree with the claimed formulas. Since S4(Γ0(9)) is one dimensional, this form must be A(z).

Using this theorem, we obtain the following immediate corollary.

The following are true about a*(n).

If m and n are coprime positive integers, then

[formula]

For every positive integer s, we have that a*(3s) = 0.

If [formula] is prime and s is a positive integer, then

[formula]

If [formula] is prime and s is a positive integer, then a*(ps)  ≠  0. Moreover, we have that

[formula]

where p = x2 + 3y2 with [formula].

Since S4(Γ0(9)) is one dimensional and since a*(1) = 1, it follows that A(z) is a normalized Hecke eigenform. Claim (1) is well known to hold for all normalized Hecke eigenforms.

Claim (2) follows by inspection since a*(n) = 0 if [formula].

To prove claims (3) and (4), we note that since A(z) is a normalized Hecke eigenform on Γ0(9), it follows, for every prime p  ≠  3, that

[formula]

If [formula] is prime, then Theorem [\ref=astar] implies that

[formula]

Claim (3) now follows by induction since a*(1) = 1 and a*(p) = 0.

Suppose that [formula] is prime. By Theorem [\ref=astar], we know that a*(p)  ≠  0. More importantly, we have that where p = x2 + 3y2 with [formula]. To see this, one merely observes that

[formula]

Since [formula] and is non-zero, it follows that [formula]. By ([\ref=powerrecursion]), we then have that

[formula]

By induction, it follows that [formula], which is non-zero modulo p. This proves claim (4).

Here we give some numerical examples of the formulas for a*(n).

1) One easily finds that a*(13) =  - 70. The prime p = 13 is of the form x2 + 3y2 where x = 1 and y = 2. Obviously, [formula], and so Theorem [\ref=astar] asserts that a*(13) = 2  ·  13 - 18  ·  1  ·  22 =  - 70.

2) We have that a*(13) =  - 70 and a*(16) = 64. One easily checks that a*(13  ·  16) = a*(208) =  - 70  ·  64 =  - 4408. This is an example of Corollary [\ref=aprimepower] (1).

3) If p = 5 and s = 3, then Corollary [\ref=aprimepower] (3) asserts that a*(53) = 0. If p = 5 and s = 4, then it asserts that a*(54) = 56 = 15625. One easily checks both evaluations numerically.

4) Now we consider the prime [formula]. Since x = 1 and y = 2 for p = 13, Corollary [\ref=aprimepower] (4) asserts that [formula]. One easily checks that

Proof of Theorem [\ref=hanconjecture] and Corollary [\ref=lacunarity]

Before we prove Theorem [\ref=hanconjecture], we recall a known formula for b(n) (also see Section 3 of [\cite=GranvilleOno]), the number of 3-core partitions of n.

Assuming the notation above, we have that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the usual Legendre symbol modulo 3.

We have that B(z) = η(9z)3  /  η(3z) is in M1(Γ0(9),χ), where [formula]. The lemma follows easily from this fact. One may implement the theory of weight 1 Eisenstein series to obtain the desired formulas.

Alternatively, one may use the weight 1 form

[formula]

Using the theory of twists, we find that By dimensionality (see Section 1.2.3 of [\cite=OnoCBMS]) we have that [formula]. The claimed formulas for the coefficients follows easily from the fact that x2 + xy + y2 corresponds to the norm form on the ring of integers of [formula].

The only divisors of primes [formula] are 1 and p, and so we have that [formula].

The theorem follows immediately from Theorems [\ref=astar], [\ref=aprimepower] and Lemma [\ref=3core]. One sees that the only [formula] for which a*(n) = 0 are those n for which [formula] is odd for some prime [formula]. The same conclusion holds for b*(n). Using the fact that

[formula]

the theorem follows.

In a famous paper [\cite=Serrelacunarity], Serre proved that "almost all" of the coefficients of a modular form with complex multiplication are zero. This implies that almost all of the a*(n) are zero. The result now follows thanks to Theorem [\ref=hanconjecture].
