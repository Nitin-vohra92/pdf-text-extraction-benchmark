[formula]

, S. Nanda, introduced the concept of fuzzy field. Using this concept of fuzzy field, we have considered the fuzzy field of real and complex numbers and thereafter we have established a few standard results of real and complex numbers with respect to a membership function. In particular, if we consider the characteristic function instead of membership function, our results will coincide with the usual results of real and complex numbers. In the first section, we have introduced the fuzzy field of real numbers   [formula] , modulus of a member of   [formula] , supremum , infimum of a subset of   [formula] and a few properties depending on these concepts. In section two, we have introduced the concepts of sequence in   [formula] , convergence and divergence of a sequence in   [formula]. In section three , we have introduced the concept of fuzzy field of complex numbers   [formula] , complex conjugate, modulus, argument of a member of   [formula] , exponential function, logarithm function in   [formula] and a few properties depending on these concepts. Lastly we have given a conclusion, where we have described our future research.

[formula] Let   X   be a field and   F   a fuzzy set in   X   with membership function   μ  F.   Then   F   is a fuzzy field in   X   iff. the following conditions are satisfied :

Throughout our discussion , we will consider the field   X   as the field of real numbers   [formula]   or as the field of complex numbers   [formula] . Also, we consider   [formula]   as a fuzzy field of real numbers and   [formula]   as a fuzzy field of complex numbers and the members are respectively called   μ  -   fuzzy real numbers and μ  -   fuzzy complex numbers.

For   [formula] ,   x  1      ≤    μ    x  2   if and only if   x  1  μ  (  x  1  )      ≤      x  2  μ  (  x  2  ) .   Similarly , we can define   x  1      <    μ    x  2 ,   x  2      ≥    μ    x  1 ,   x  2      >    μ    x  1 .

Let   [formula] . Then the modulus of   a   in   [formula]   is denoted by   |  a  |  μ   and defined as   |  a  |  μ      =      |  a  |  μ  (  a  ) ,   where   |  a  |   denotes the usual modulus of   [formula] .

Let   [formula].   A is said to be μ    -   bounded above in [formula] if the set   {  x  μ(  x  )    :    x    ε    A}   is bounded above in   [formula]. The   μ    -   supremum of A is denoted by sup   μ  A and defined by   sup   μ  A      =       sup   {  x  μ(  x  )    :    x    ε    A  } . Similarly , A is said to be μ    -   bounded below in [formula] if the set   {  x  μ(  x  )    :    x    ε    A}   is bounded below in   [formula]. The   μ    -   infimum of A is denoted by inf   μ  A and defined by   inf   μ  A      =       inf   {  x  μ(  x  )    :    x    ε    A  } . A set [formula] is said to be μ    -   bounded if it is both μ    -   bounded above and μ    -   bounded below.

If [formula] is bounded then it is μ    -   bounded.

Obvious.

Completeness property of [formula] Statement I : Every non - empty   μ    -   bounded above subset of   [formula] has a   μ    -   supremum. Statement II : Every non - empty   μ    -   bounded below subset of   [formula] has a   μ    -   infimum.

Suppose the Statement I holds and A is a non -   empty subset of [formula], which is bounded below in [formula]. Then A has an μ    -   infimum .

Let A be a non -   empty subset of [formula] and μ    -   bounded above in [formula]. An μ    -   upper bounded M of A is μ    -   supremum of A if and only if for each   ε      >      0 there exists an element   x  1    ε    A such that   M    -    ε      <      x  1  μ(  x  1  )      ≤      M.

§   2. Sequence in [formula]   :

Let   {  x  n  }  n be a sequence in [formula]. Then   {  x  n  }  n is said to converge to x  0 in [formula] if for every   ε      >      0, there exists a natural number k such that |  x  n    -    x  0  |  μ      <      ε    for all   n      ≥      k. If {  x  n  }  n converges to x  0 in [formula] then we express it by [formula]   as   n      →        ∞   , x  0 is called μ    -   limit of the sequence {  x  n  }  n in [formula] and {  x  n  }  n is called μ    -   convergent in [formula].

If {  x  n  }  n converges to l in [formula] then {  x  n  }  n converges to l in [formula].

Obvious

The converse of the above theorem is not necessarily true. In fact, μ    -   limit of {  x  n  }  n is not necessarily unique. For example , let   x  n    =     log n    +    1   and   [formula]   for all   n    ≥    1 ,   [formula], μ(  x  n    +    x  m  )      =      μ(  x  n    -    x  m  )      =      μ(  x  n  x  m  )      =      μ(  x  n  x    -    1  m  )      =      1, μ(  y  n    +    y  m  )      =      μ(  y  n    -    y  m  )      =      μ(  y  n  y  m  )      =      μ(  y  n  y    -    1  m  )      =      1 , μ(  x  n    +    y  m  )      =      μ(  x  n    -    y  m  )      =      μ(  x  n  y    -    1  m  )      =      μ(  x    -    1  n  y    -    1  m  )      =      1, μ(  x  )    =    0   for all other   [formula].   Here we see that [formula]   as   n      →        ∞   but {  x  n  }  n is not convergent in [formula]. We also see that [formula]   as   n      →        ∞   .

If [formula]   =      a      >      0 then {  x  n  }  n converges to l in [formula] if and only if {  x  n  }  n converges to l in [formula].

If [formula]   =      a      >      0   and   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞     then   l is unique .

If [formula]   =      a      >      0   and   {  x  n  }  n   is μ    -   convergent in [formula] then   {  x  n  }  n   is μ    -   bounded in [formula].

Let   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .   [formula]   For   ε    =    1, there exists   [formula]   such that |  x  n    -    l  |  μ      <      1    for all   n      ≥      k   [formula]   l  μ(  x  n    -    l  )    -    1      <      x  n  μ(  x  n    -    l  )      <      l  μ(  x  n    -    l  )    +    1    for all   n      ≥      k   [formula]   [formula]    for all   n      ≥      k   [formula]   [formula]   is bounded in [formula]   [formula]   {  x  n  }  n   is μ    -   bounded in [formula].

If we drop the condition   [formula]   =      a      >      0   from the above theorem , the theorem may fails to hold. For example , consider   x  n    =    e  n    +    2 and define   [formula]    for all   n      ≥      1  ,  μ(  x  n    +    x  m  )      =      μ(  x  n    -    x  m  )      =      μ(  x  n  x  m  )      =      μ(  x  n  x    -    1  m  )      =      1  ,  μ(  x  )    =    0   for all other   [formula].   Here ,   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞     but {  x  n  }  n   is not   μ    -   bounded in [formula].

Let x  n      →      l   and   y  n      →      m   as   n      →        ∞  . Then   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞

Obvious

[formula] , [formula]   as   n      →        ∞     do not always imply   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  . For example, let   [formula] ,   [formula],   [formula] ,   μ(  t  n    +    t  m  )      =      μ(  t  n    -    t  m  )      =      μ(  t  n  t  m  )      =      μ(  t  n  t    -    1  m  )      =      1 ,   where   t  n    =    x  n    -    1 , m    ≠    n ,   μ(  x  )    =    0   for all other   [formula].   Here we see that   [formula] ,   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .   But   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .

If [formula]   =      a      >      0 ,   [formula] , [formula]   as   n      →        ∞     then   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .

Let x  n      →      l   and   y  n      →      m   as   n      →        ∞  . Then   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞

[formula] , [formula]   as   n      →        ∞     do not always imply   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  . For example, let   [formula]  and  [formula]   [formula]  and  [formula]   [formula]  and define μ suitably at all other points of [formula] such that all the conditions of the definition(  1  ) are being satisfied. Here we see that   [formula] ,   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .   But   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .

If [formula]   =      a      >      0 ,   [formula] , [formula]   as   n      →        ∞     then   [formula]   as   n      →        ∞  .

A sequence   {  x  n  }  n   in [formula]   is said to be μ    -   increasing if   [formula]

If   {  x  n  }  n   is   μ    -   increasing and μ    -   bounded above then   {  x  n  μ(  x  n  )  }  n converges to its supremum .

§   3 μ    -   Fuzzy Complex Numbers [formula]

Let   [formula] . μ    -   conjugate of z is denoted by   [formula] and defined by   [formula] ,   where   [formula]   is the usual complex conjugate of z .

Let   [formula] . μ    -   modulus of z is denoted by   |  z  |  μ and defined by   |  z  |  μ    =    |  z  |  μ(  z  ) ,   where   |  z  |   is the usual modulus of z.

Let   [formula] . μ    -   argument of z is denoted by   arg   μ(  z  )   and defined by   arg   μ(  z  )      =       arg (  z  )  μ(  z  ) ,   -    π    <     arg (  z  )    ≤    π .

Let   [formula] . Then   exp   μ(  z  )      =       exp (  z  )  μ(  z  ) , where   exp (  z  )   denotes the usual exponential function in   [formula] .

exp   μ(  0  )      =       exp (  0  )  μ(  0  )      =      1

[formula] ,   μ  (  z  )  ,  μ  (  n  z  )    ≠    0

Let   [formula]   and   z    ≠    0. μ    -   logarithm of z is denoted by   Log  μ(  z  )   and defined by   Log  μ(  z  )      =      Log  (  z  )  μ(  z  ) .

Let   [formula]  ,  a    ≠    0   and   [formula]. We now define   a  z  μ   by   a  z  μ      =      a  z  μ  (  z  )      =       exp   μ  (  z  Log  a  )   and   p.v.(  a  z  μ  )      =      p.v.(  a  z  )  μ  (  z  )

Conclusion   :   In next research, we are trying to established the concepts of a function in   [formula]   or   [formula] , limit , continuity , differentiability etc. of such function .
