Key words: Poisson cohomology, truncated polynomial algebra, quantum complete intersections.

Introduction

Given a Poisson algebra, its Poisson cohomology-as introduced by Lichnerowicz in [\cite=Lichn]-provides important informations about the Poisson structure (the Casimir elements are reflected by the degree zero cohomology, Poisson derivations modulo Hamiltonian derivations by the degree one,...). It also plays a crucial role in the study of deformations of the Poisson structure. A classical problem in algebraic deformation is to compare the Poisson (co)homology of a Poisson algebra with the Hochschild (co)homology of its deformation. Although these homologies are known to behave similarly in smooth cases (see e.g. [\cite=brylinski] [\cite=K] [\cite=Kont] [\cite=LMP]), the singular case seems more complicated to deal with. There are many examples in which the trace groups already do not match in [\cite=AF]. Even though the dimension of the homology spaces in degree zero match, as for Kleinian singularities in [\cite=AL98], it might not be the case in higher degree (see [\cite=AFLS] and [\cite=Pichereau]).

Our aim in this paper is to provide an example of a singular Poisson algebra such that its Poisson cohomology ring is isomorphic as a graded commutative algebra to the Hochschild cohomology ring of a natural deformation. Namely for two integers a,b  ≥  2 we consider the truncated polynomial algebra [formula] with the Poisson bracket given by {X,Y} = XY. This algebra is the semi-classical limit of the quantum complete intersection Λq(a,b) studied by Bergh and Erdmann in [\cite=BE]. The homological properties of this class of noncommutative finite-dimensional algebras have been extensively studied recently (see for instance [\cite=BGMS] [\cite=Bergh] [\cite=BE] [\cite=BO]). In particular it is proved in [\cite=BGMS] that the generic quantum exterior algebra (corresponding to the case a = b = 2) provides a counter-example to Happel's question. That is, the global dimension of Λq(2,2) is infinite whereas its Hochschild cohomology groups vanish in degree greater than 2. Recently the Hochschild cohomology ring of Λq(a,b) has been described in [\cite=BE] when q is not a root of unity. It is a five-dimensional graded algebra isomorphic to the fibre product [formula], with U in degree zero and V and W in degree one. In this paper we obtain the same description for the Poisson cohomology ring of Λ(a,b), giving rise to

Note that Λ(a,b) is not unimodular (see for instance [\cite=Kosmann] for a recent survey on the modular class of a Poisson manifold). Indeed, there is no Poincaré duality between H Pk(Λ(a,b)) and H P2 - k(Λ(a,b)). For instance H P2(Λ(a,b)) has dimension 1 whereas H P0(Λ(a,b)) has dimension a + b - 1. One cannot even expect a twisted Poincaré duality as in [\cite=LMP] (see the paragraph below Lemma [\ref=lem:trace]). However, the Nakayama automorphism ν coming from the Frobenius structure of the quantum complete intersection Λq(a,b) (see [\cite=BE]) allows us to construct a Poisson module Mν such that

Poisson cohomology of truncated polynomials

The algebra Λ(a,b) has dimension ab, with basis {eij: = XiYj | 0  ≤  i  ≤  a - 1, 0  ≤  j  ≤  b - 1}. One easily checks that the following formulas hold in Λ(a,b) for all i,j:

[formula]

Recall that the complex computing the Poisson cohomology is (χk,δk), with χk the space of skew-symmetric k-derivations of Λ(a,b). Interestingly, these spaces vanish for k  ≥  3, since Λ(a,b) is 2-generated. The Poisson coboundary operator δk:χk  →  χk + 1 is defined by

[formula]

for all P∈χk and [formula]. It is easy to check that δk(P) belongs indeed to χk + 1 and that [formula]. The [formula] Poisson cohomology space of Λ(a,b), denoted by H Pk(Λ(a,b)), is the [formula] cohomology space of this complex. The Poisson cohomology ring is the space [formula]. Endowed with the cup product induced by the exterior product on [formula] it becomes a graded commutative algebra. We start by describing the spaces H Pk(Λ(a,b)) for k = 0,1,2 as it is clear that H Pk(Λ(a,b)) = 0 for k  ≥  3.

Let [formula], and assume it satisfies {λ,X}  =  {λ,Y} = 0. Then equations ([\ref=bracket]) lead successively to λij = 0 for all i  ≠  a - 1 and all j  ≠  0, and then to λij = 0 for all i  ≠  0 and j  ≠  b - 1. Hence

The Poisson centre H P0(Λ(a,b)) is equal to [formula].

Any derivation d∈χ1 is uniquely determined by the values of [formula] and [formula]. Moreover, d must satisfy the relations d(Xa) = d(Yb) = 0, that is Xa - 1d(X) = Yb - 1d(Y) = 0, since d is a derivation. From that one easily deduces that λ0j  =  λ'i0 = 0 for all i,j. Hence the space χ1  =  Der(A,A) has basis [formula], where:

for 1  ≤  i < a and 0  ≤  j < b, the derivation dij is defined by dij(X) = XiYj and dij(Y) = 0;

for 0  ≤  i < a and 1  ≤  j < b, the derivation d'ij is defined by d'ij(X) = 0 and d'ij(Y) = XiYj.

In particular,  dim(χ1) = b(a - 1) + a(b - 1). Let [formula]. Then d∈Kerδ1 if and only if it satisfies [formula], that is:

[formula]

Identifying the coefficients in front of XiYj leads to

[formula]

[formula].

The complex computing the Poisson cohomology is vanishing after χ2, so we use the Euler-Poincaré principle to compute the dimension of H P2(Λ(a,b)). First note that a skew-symmetric derivation f∈χ2 is determined by [formula], with [formula], so that c0j = ci0 = 0 for all i,j. Thus χ2 has dimension (a - 1)(b - 1).

[formula], with [formula].

Note that the basis (e0,0,ea - 1,b - 1,d1,0,d'0,1,f1,1) of H P*(Λ(a,b)) corresponds to the basis (1,yb - 1xa - 1,g,h,hg) considered in the proof of [\cite=BE].

(Twisted) Poisson homology

Let M be a right Poisson module over Λ(a,b) (the reader is referred to [\cite=LMP] for the definition of a Poisson module). We denote by [formula] its external bracket. Then one defines a chain complex on the Λ(a,b)-modules [formula], where Ωk denotes the so-called Kähler differential k-forms of Λ(a,b), as follows. The boundary operator [formula] is defined by

[formula]

where we have removed the expressions under the hats in the previous sums and d denotes the exterior differential. The homology of this complex is denoted by H P*(Λ(a,b),M) and called the Poisson homology of the Poisson algebra Λ(a,b) with values in the Poisson module M. Before computing the Poisson homology spaces for a specific module, we describe the spaces Ωk. By definition Ωk is a Λ(a,b)-module generated by the wedge products of length k of the 1-differential forms dX,dY. In particular Ωk = 0 for k  ≥  3. In the remaining cases the torsion coming from the relations Xa = Yb = 0 leads to the following spaces:

[formula]

and

[formula]

Their dimensions are respectively ab, (a - 1)b + b(a - 1), and (a - 1)(b - 1). As the bracket {λ,μ} belongs to the ideal generated by XY for any λ,μ∈Λ(a,b), one easily checks that:

H P0(Λ(a,b)) has dimension a + b - 1.

As a + b - 1  ≥  3 for any a,b  ≥  2, and H P2(Λ(a,b)) has dimension 1, this lemma shows that there is no Poincaré duality between H Pk(Λ(a,b)) and H P2 - k(Λ(a,b)).

We may ask now if there is a twisted duality similar to the one obtained in [\cite=LMP]. The Poisson algebra Λ(a,b) is the semi-classical limit of the quantum complete intersection Λq(a,b) which is the [formula]-algebra generated by x,y with relations xy = qyx, xa = 0, yb = 0 (see [\cite=BE]). Any diagonal automorphism σ of Λq(a,b) defined by σ(x) = qαx and σ(y) = qβy gives rise to a Poisson module Mσ of Λ(a,b) via a semi-classical limit process (see [\cite=LMP] for details). As a vector space Mσ is equal to Λ(a,b), and the external Poisson bracket is defined by:

[formula]

From these formulas one easily deduces that if α <  - b + 1 and β > a - 1, then [formula]. So one might be tempted to use such a Poisson module to restore a twisted Poincaré duality between H Pk(Λ(a,b)) and H P2 - k(Λ(a,b),Mσ) as in [\cite=LMP]. Unfortunately, these hypotheses on α and β also lead to H P2(Λ(a,b),Mσ) = 0, so that H P2(Λ(a,b),Mσ) is not isomorphic to H P0(Λ(a,b)).

The Nakayama automorphism ν of Λq(a,b) coming from the Frobenius algebra structure of Λq(a,b) is defined by ν(x) = q1 - bx and ν(y) = qa - 1y. This automorphism was used in [\cite=BE] to link the twisted Hochschild homology and the Hochschild cohomology of Λq(a,b) in each degree. We end this paper by computing the dimensions of the Poisson homology spaces of Λ(a,b) with value in the Poisson module Mν corresponding to the Nakayama automorphism ν.

The twisted Poisson homology spaces H Pk(Λ(a,b),Mν) have dimension 2,2,1 for k = 0,1,2 respectively, and are null if k  ≥  3.

We deduce from Proposition [\ref=prop:naka] and Theorem [\ref=thm:coh] a duality similar to the one appearing in [\cite=BE], that is H Pk(Λ(a,b))≃H Pk(Λ(a,b),Mν) for all nonnegative integer k as claimed in Theorem [\ref=thm:dual].
