THE ROLE OF THE EXCHANGE INTERACTION IN THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL n-COMPONENT HUBBARD MODEL

Recent experimental results in ultracold gases in optical lattices may be simulated by multi-component fermionic systems in which spins can take more than two degrees of freedom [\cite=honer]. A natural candidate for the description of such systems from the theoretical point of view is the SU(n)-symmetric generalization of the standard SU(2) Hubbard model [\cite=Hubb1-4] which has been investigated intensively in the past by both analytic and numerical approaches [\cite=honer] [\cite=marston] [\cite=assaraf] [\cite=assaad] [\cite=szirmai01] [\cite=LSS] [\cite=BLSS] [\cite=rapp] [\cite=zhao]. In fact this model may mimic strongly correlated electron systems where the orbital degrees of freedom of d and f electrons play important role and these extra degrees of freedom are taken into account by considering n-component fermions.

The Hamiltonian of the model is usually written in the form

[formula]

where N is the number of sites in the chain. The operator [formula] ([formula]) creates (annihilates) an electron at site i with spin σ, where the spin index is allowed to take n different values. ni,σ is the particle-number operator, t is the hopping integral between nearest-neighbor sites, and U is the strength of the on-site Coulomb repulsion. In what follows t will be taken as the unit of energy.

It is well known that in the weak-coupling regime the half-filled n-component Hubbard model is an insulator with gapped charge and spin modes (for n > 2), while in the large U limit the system can be described -- at least for even n -- by an effective Heisenberg model [\cite=marston] [\cite=szirmai01]. Away from half filling, based on leading-order renormalization group analysis, where the higher-order umklapp processes do not give contribution, one can find Luttinger liquid behavior with gapless bosonic charge and spin modes. However, one can expect that these higher order processes become relevant for commensurate fillings and cannot be neglected. To see their effect, first we analyze how the spectrum of a Luttinger liquid is modified by these processes and then we study the occurrence of phases with spatial inhomogeneity for special fillings.

In order to describe the low temperature physics of the system, one can consider only that part of the Hilbert space which contains states close to the Fermi surface. Therefore, in one dimension the dispersion relation can be linearized around the Fermi points [formula]. With this approximation the properties of the fermion problem can be calculated by using the renormalization group method and bosonization [\cite=S-GNT]. One finds that for generic fillings, the n-component Hubbard model -- as well as the usual n = 2 component model -- is an n-component Luttinger liquid. The well-known one-particle and particle-hole excitation spectrum of the two-component Luttinger liquid [\cite=H] can be easily generalized for fermions with n internal degrees of freedom:

[formula]

where the momentum is quantized in units of 2π / L, and nj± are integers describing the particle-hole type bosonic excitations: the term [formula] describes the excitations of the charge mode which is the symmetric combination of the bosonic phase fields φσ(x) of the corresponding fermion fields, [formula]. The terms [formula] describe the excitations of the n - 1 spin modes which are independent antisymmetric combinations of the appropriate boson fields, [formula]. In Eq. ([\ref=eq:Lutt-Ham-1]) Δj± corresponds to the one-particle excitations: [formula], where δNj is the change in the number of particles, and Jj describes the current in the jth channel generated by processes which break the chiral particle-number or spin conservation. Since the total momentum is given by

[formula]

and the charge current [formula] is an even number due to the total particle-number conservation, in the termodymanic limit soft modes appear not only at zero momentum but also at even integer multiples of [formula] for filling f.

For commensurate filling the higher-order umklapp processes are not irrelevant anymore, and they modify the Luttinger liquid spectrum. In the considered restricted Hilbert space (with low energy states), the higher-order umklapp processes can be described only by multiparticle scatterings in fermion representation, and in these processes the number of scattered particles depends on the filling factor f. Namely, for f = p / q filling, exacly q particles take part in the leading-order multiparticle umklapp processes. Therefore, due to the Pauli principle these processes are forbidden for local interaction, if q > n, and the system remains Luttinger liquid. If, on the other hand, q  ≤  n, at least for strong interactions these processes are relevant, and their contribution has to be taken into account. The q-particle umklapp processes can be described in the terms of the bosonic fields as

[formula]

Here g3 is the coupling of q-particle umklapp processes and prime indicates that the summation over the spin indices gives contribution only for terms which contains phase fields with different spins. The other terms are forbidden by the Pauli principle. One can easily see from Eq. ([\ref=eq:umkl]) that for q = n the leading-order umklapp processes modify only the spectrum of the symmetric combination of the boson fields, which means, that the excitation of the charge mode needs a finite energy of order g3, while the spin modes remain gapless. It is more interesting, as we will see, that if q < n, the leading-order umklapp scatterings couple the spin and charge modes, and due to this coupling the whole spectrum becomes gapped -- not only at zero momentum, but at [formula], and integer multiples of k*, too.

Considering the analytical predictions it is expected that the behavior of the system should be determined by the [formula] modes. We have, therefore, studied the model numerically using the high-precision density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method [\cite=white-dmrg] for several system sizes and values of q and n as a function of U. We have detected and located quantum phase transition points (QPTs) and determined the spatial characteristics of the ground state using various quantum information entropies [\cite=vidal-qpt] [\cite=legeza-qpt] [\cite=legeza-incomm]

[formula]

where a finite block of length l of a long chain of N sites is considered with the corresponding reduced subsystem density matrix ρN(l). As has been shown before [\cite=vidal-qpt] [\cite=legeza-qpt], anomalies in the entropy functions or in their derivate signal QPTs, and peaks in the Fourier spectrum of sN(l) carry information about the position of soft modes (for critical models) or the spatial inhomogeneity of the ground state (for gapped systems) [\cite=legeza-incomm]. In the latter case the spatial modulation of the ground state can be a site- or a bond-centered density wave. A site-centered density wave would manifest itself in an oscillation of the entropy of single sites or in the local electron density. The existence of a bond-centered density wave can be demonstrated by studying the variation of the bond energy or the two-site entropy along the chain [\cite=legeza-qpt].

We have found that for models with q  ≥  n, for finite systems, the block entropy oscillates with a period determined by the filling, but all Fourier components except for q = 0 disappear in the N  →    ∞   limit. Therefore, the ground state of the system is spatially uniform. Using the analytic form of the block entropy known for critical models [\cite=cardy],

[formula]

where g is a shift due to the open boundary, we have also determined the value of the central charge c. For q > n the model remains critical with c = n for finite U as well [\cite=LSS], while when q = n, a charge gap opens for finite U > 0, whereas the spin modes remain gapless, c = n - 1 [\cite=BLSS], in agreement with the theoretical expectation. This means that the ground state for p / n-filling is a critical SDW phase without true long-range order.

A significantly different behavior has been found for systems with q < n. The block entropy function saturates beyond some system size [\cite=LSS] for finite U values, indicating that the corresponding models are fully gapped [\cite=vidal-size]. In fact, gap opens in the spectrum of all modes for U > 0 [\cite=BLSS]. Even more interestingly, the translational symmetry of the Hamiltonian is broken and a spatially nonuniform ground state emerges whose periodicity depends on the filling. Since all Fourier components of the site entropy and local charge density have been found to vanish for long chains, the ground state is a bond-centered density wave. Therefore, we have identified bond-ordered dimerized, trimerized or tetramerized phases depending on the filling.

The occurrence of this spatially nonuniform phase was further investigated analytically on mean-field level in the large n limit, for one-third-filled system, with n an integer multiple of 3. It was mentioned above that the change of the periodicity of the translational invariance can be realized by site- or bond-centered density waves, however, bond ordering cannot be taken into account within the applied method [\cite=LSS] if there is no nearest-neighbour interaction in the system. In order to analyse the possibility of bond ordering, too, we have considered a more general model, the Hubbard-Heisenberg model [\cite=marston], which contains antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour spin-exchange J, in addition to the on-site Coulomb repulsion U. The Hubbard-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where we use the same notations as in Eq. ([\ref=eq:ham]), and [formula] is the SU(n) spin operator.

We have found that the periodicity of the translational invariance changes for arbitrary small positive value of J: it seems that the Hubbard model is unstable against the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg exchange, independently of the value of the on-site Coulomb interaction. Considering this instability and the well-known behaviour of the Hubbard model in the strong-coupling limit -- where it is equivalent to the Heisenberg model with an effective antiferromagnetic exchange -- one can conclude, that in the Hubbard model the Heisenberg interaction becomes relevant in the intermediate regime, too, not only in the strong-coupling limit.

The above analysis for the role of the Heisenberg exchange was done only for f = 1 / 3 filling and special values of n, therefore the question of the relevant exchange interaction and its role in the occurrence of the symmetry broken phase needs further investigation, e.g., it would be interesting to analyse the phase diagram of the n-component t-U-J model for different commensurate fillings, and for different values of the couplings.
