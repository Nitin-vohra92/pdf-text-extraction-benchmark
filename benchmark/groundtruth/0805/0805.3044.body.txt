Asymptotics of Characteristic Polynomials of Wigner Matrices at the Edge of the Spectrum

Introduction and Statement of the Main Results

Let Q be a fixed probability distribution on the real line such that

[formula]

and for any [formula] let [formula] denote the associated Hermitian Wigner matrix of size N. This means that

[formula]

where [formula] is a collection of i.i.d. real random variables with distribution Q. The second-order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of the random matrix XN is defined by

[formula]

where DN(λ): =  det (XN  -  λ). We are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of fN(μN,νN) as N  →    ∞  , for certain sequences (μN), (νN) which will be specified below. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of the random matrix XN is defined by

[formula]

In the special case where Q is the Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance [formula], the distribution of the random matrix XN is the so-called Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) (see e.g. Forrester [\cite=Fo] or Mehta [\cite=Me] but note that we work with a different variance). In this case, it is well-known that

[formula]

where

[formula]

and the pk are the monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function e- x2 / 2 (see e.g. Chapter 4.1 in Forrester [\cite=Fo]). Thus, up to scaling, the pk coincide with the Hermite polynomials (as defined in Szegö [\cite=Sz]), and it is possible to derive the asymptotics of the second-order correlation function fN from the well-known asymptotics of the Hermite polynomials (see e.g. Theorem 8.22.9 in Szegö [\cite=Sz]). More precisely, one obtains the following (well-known) results (see also Chapter 4.2 in Forrester [\cite=Fo]): For ξ∈( - 2, + 2) and any [formula],

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], and

[formula]

For ξ  =   + 2 and any [formula],

[formula]

where [formula],

[formula]

and [formula] denotes the Airy function (see e.g. Abramowitz and Stegun [\cite=AS]). By symmetry, a similar result holds for ξ  =   - 2. The functions in ([\ref=sine-kernel]) and ([\ref=airy-kernel]) are also called the sine kernel and the Airy kernel, respectively. Furthermore, it is well-known that the eigenvalues of a random matrix XN from the GUE are distributed roughly over the interval

Outline of the Proofs

To prove Theorems [\ref=theorem-hermitian] and [\ref=theorem-symmetric], we will start from the fact that for fixed [formula], the exponential generating functions of the sequences fN(μ,ν) and [formula] are given explicitly by

[formula]

(see Lemma 2.3 in Götze and Kösters [\cite=GK]) and

[formula]

(see Lemma 2.3 in Kösters [\cite=Ko]), respectively. This fact opens up the possibility to study the asymptotic behaviour of the second-order correlation functions by evaluating appropriate contour integrals of their exponential generating functions. In fact, this strategy was already used by Götze and Kösters [\cite=GK] and Kösters [\cite=Ko] to obtain the above-mentioned results for the bulk of the spectrum. Here we carry out a similar analysis for the edge of the spectrum.

Since it does not require any additional efforts, it seems convenient to evaluate the values

[formula]

for arbitrary α  >  0 and [formula], where γ denotes a contour around the origin. By the foregoing, the case α  =  1 corresponds to the Hermitian case and the case α  =  2 corresponds to the real-symmetric case.

We remark in passing that for a general parameter α  >  0, it is not hard to see that the exponential generating function under consideration can be interpreted as that of the second-order correlation function of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix from (a rescaled version of) the tridiagonal beta ensemble introduced by Dumitriu and Edelman [\cite=DE1] with α  =  2 / β. For this interpretation, one should set b*: = 0.

For α  >  0 and [formula], put

[formula]

In the next section, we will prove the following results:

For any α  >  0, [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

For any [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

where (    ·    )(α) denotes the α-fold application of the given differential operator. (For μ  =  ν, consider the continuous extension of the right-hand side.)

It is straightforward to check that

[formula]

and

[formula]

(For the second identity, use the fact that the Airy function [formula] satisfies the differential equation [formula].) Thus, in view of the preceding comments, it is immediate that Theorems [\ref=theorem-hermitian] and [\ref=theorem-symmetric], which correspond to the special cases α  =  1 and α  =  2, follow from Propositions [\ref=theproposition2] and [\ref=theproposition3].

To prove Corollaries [\ref=corollary-hermitian] and [\ref=corollary-symmetric], observe that

[formula]

in the Hermitian case and

[formula]

in the real-symmetric case. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that

[formula]

where HN(x) is the Nth Hermite polynomial (see e.g. Section 5.5 in Szegö [\cite=Sz]). Thus, in both cases, the expectation of the characteristic polynomial is given by the same function gN(λ). Therefore, to deduce Corollaries [\ref=corollary-hermitian] and [\ref=corollary-symmetric] from Theorems [\ref=theorem-hermitian] and [\ref=theorem-symmetric], respectively, it will be sufficient to show that gN(μ)  gN(ν) is asymptotically negligible in comparison to fN(μ,ν) and [formula].

Slightly more generally, we will consider the case of an arbitrary parameter α  >  0 and investigate the asymptotic behaviour of

[formula]

for any [formula]. In the next section, we will show that Proposition [\ref=theproposition2] entails the following result:

For any α  >  0, [formula] and [formula] such that I(α)(μ,μ)  >  0, I(α)(ν,ν)  >  0, we have

[formula]

Furthermore, we will prove the following:

For any [formula], we have I(α)(x,x)  >  0 for all [formula].

In view of the preceding comments, it is obvious that Corollaries [\ref=corollary-hermitian] and [\ref=corollary-symmetric], which correspond to the special cases α  =  1 and α  =  2, follow from Propositions [\ref=theproposition5] and [\ref=theproposition6].

We remark in passing that for a general parameter α  >  0, σ(α)N(μ,ν) can be interpreted as the correlation coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix from (the rescaled version of) the tridiagonal beta ensemble (with α  =  2 / β), since in this setting, the average of the characteristic polynomial is also given by the Hermite polynomial (see Theorem 4.1 in Dumitriu and Edelman [\cite=DE1]).

The Proofs

Fix [formula]. We have to evaluate

[formula]

where μN: = 2N1 / 2  +  μN- 1 / 6, νN: = 2N1 / 2  +  νN- 1 / 6, and γ denotes a contour around the origin (which will be chosen further below).

Setting ξN: = (μN  +  νN) / 2 and ηN: = (μN  -  νN) / 2, ([\ref=intrep1]) may be written as

[formula]

with

[formula]

In particular, the leading exponential factor in ([\ref=intrep2]) is asymptotically the same as that in Proposition [\ref=theproposition2].

Thus, to complete the proof of Proposition [\ref=theproposition2], it suffices to show that

[formula]

where

[formula]

Similarly as in the proof of the main theorem in [\cite=GK], the basic idea is that the main contribution to the integral in ([\ref=intrep3]) comes from a small neighborhood of the point z = 1. Let

[formula]

(where log  denotes the principal branch of the logarithm) and

[formula]

Then the left-hand side in ([\ref=intrep3]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Put IN,1(a): = ( - aN- 1 / 3; + aN- 1 / 3) and [formula], where a  >  0. We shall prove the following:

Claim 1: For any fixed a  >  0,

[formula]

Claim 2: For any δ  >  0, there exists a constant a0  >  0 such that for all a  ≥  a0,

[formula]

for all [formula] sufficiently large.

Before turning to the proofs, let us show that Claims 1 and 2 imply ([\ref=intrep3]). Observe that

[formula]

Thus, for a  >  0 sufficiently large, we have not only the conclusion of Claim 2, but also the inequality

[formula]

Hence, in combination with Claim 1, it follows that

[formula]

for all [formula] sufficiently large. Since δ  >  0 is arbitrary, this proves ([\ref=intrep3]).

Proof of Claim 1: First of all, substituting t  =  uN- 1 / 3, we have

[formula]

We will determine the asymptotics of hN(γN(uN- 1 / 3)) as N  →    ∞  , for u∈[ -  a,  +  a]. The O-bounds occurring in the sequel hold uniformly in this region. To begin with, note that

[formula]

Therefore, for N sufficiently large, we have the following approximations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Putting these approximations together, the terms of highest order cancel out, and we end up with

[formula]

Hence, by an application of the dominated convergence theorem, it follows that

[formula]

and Claim 1 is proved.

Proof of Claim 2: By symmetry, it suffices to consider the interval (aN- 1 / 3,π). Write the integral as

[formula]

Since ξN and ηN are real and |γN(t)|  ≤  1, this is clearly bounded by

[formula]

In the following, let K,K1,K2  >  0 denote constants which depend only on α,b*,μ,ν (which are regarded as fixed) but which may change from occurrence to occurrence. Then we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

(as follows from a straightforward calculation) and therefore

[formula]

Since

[formula]

it follows that

[formula]

for some constant K*  >  0, say. Now let ε  >  0 denote a constant such that [formula] for all t∈[0,π]. Then, for [formula], N1 / 3  ≥   max {ε- 2,aπ- 1} and t∈[aN -  1  /  3,π], we have

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

Thus, since |1  ±  γN(t)|  ≥  N- 1 / 3, the integral under consideration is bounded by

[formula]

Obviously, this upper bound can be made arbitrarily small by picking a and N large enough. This proves Claim 2.

The proof of Proposition [\ref=theproposition2] is complete now.

The basic ingredient for the proof of Proposition [\ref=theproposition3] will be the following integral representation for the product of two Airy functions:

For any [formula],

[formula]

where L denotes some (unbounded) contour from ∞  e-  πi / 3 to ∞  e+  πi / 3.

In the special case where y  =    ±  x, this result can already be found in Reid [\cite=Re]. For the convenience of the reader, we give a detailed proof of Lemma [\ref=airyproduct]:

We start from the following well-known integral representation of the Airy function:

[formula]

A standard application of Cauchy's theorem shows that the contour L can be deformed into the contour t  ↦  1  +  it, [formula]. Thus, we obtain

[formula]

Observe that the resulting integral exists in the Lebesgue sense, since we have

[formula]

for any [formula].

It follows from ([\ref=ai-int]) that

[formula]

Substituting [formula] and doing a small calculation, we find that

[formula]

Using the well-known relation

[formula]

(where [formula]), it follows that

[formula]

or

[formula]

By another application of Cauchy's theorem, the contour v  ↦  2  +  iv, [formula], may be deformed back into the contour L.

Replacing the contour L in Lemma [\ref=airyproduct] by the contour t  ↦  1  +  it and substituting t  =   - u, we have

[formula]

By means of abbreviation, write E(x,y,u) for the numerator inside the integral. Then, for any α  >  0, we have

[formula]

[formula]

and therefore

[formula]

The assertion of Proposition [\ref=theproposition3] now follows by induction.

Fix [formula], and put μN: = 2N1 / 2  +  μN- 1 / 6, νN: = 2N1 / 2  +  νN- 1 / 6. Using well-known results about the asymptotic properties of the Hermite polynomials (see e.g. Theorem 8.22.9 (c) in Szegö [\cite=Sz]), we find that the function gN(λ) given by [formula] ([formula]) satisfies

[formula]

for any α  >  0. Setting [formula], we therefore obtain

[formula]

where we have used Proposition [\ref=theproposition2] as well as the assumptions I(α)(μ,μ)  >  0, I(α)(ν,ν) > 0. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=theproposition5].

First of all, note that the definition ([\ref=idefinition]) may be extended to the case α  =  0 and that [formula] for any [formula] by Lemma [\ref=airyproduct]. Thus, I(0)(x,x)  ≥  0 for any [formula], with strict inequality for x  >  0 (since it is well-known that the Airy function does not have any zeroes on the positive half-axis). Moreover, note that for any α  >  0,

[formula]

for any [formula]. Since lim x  →    ∞I(α)(x,x)  =  0, this implies that for any α  >  0,

[formula]

for any [formula]. Proposition [\ref=theproposition6] now follows by a straightforward induction on α.
