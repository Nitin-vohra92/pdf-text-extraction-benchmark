Generalizations of the Lax-Milgram theorem

Introduction

The following generalization of the Lax-Milgram Theorem was proved recently by An, Du, Duc and Tuoc in [\cite=An].

Let X be a reflexive Banach space over [formula], [formula] be an increasing sequence of closed subspaces of X and [formula]. Suppose that is a real-valued function on X  ×  V for which the following hold:

[formula] is a bounded bilinear form, for all [formula].

A(  ·  ,v) is a bounded linear functional on X, for all v∈V.

A is coercive on V, i.e. there exists c > 0 such that for all v∈V.

Then, for each bounded linear functional v* on V, there exists x∈X such that

[formula]

for all v∈V.

In this paper our aim is to prove a linear and a nonlinear extension of Theorem [\ref=theorem1]. In the linear case we use a variant of a theorem due to Hayden [\cite=Hayden1] [\cite=Hayden2] and thus manage to substitute the coercivity condition in (c) of the previous theorem with a more general [formula] condition. In the nonlinear case we appropriately modify the notion of type M operator and use a surjectivity result for monotone, hemicontinuous, coercive operators. We also present two examples to illustrate the applicability of our results.

All Banach spaces considered are over [formula]. Given a Banach space X, X* will denote its dual and 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 their duality product. Moreover if M is a subset of X, then [formula] will denote its annihilator in [formula] and if N is a subset of [formula], then [formula] will denote its preannihilator in X.

The linear case

To prove our main result for the linear case we need the following lemma which is a variant of [\cite=Hayden1] and [\cite=Hayden2]:

Let X be a reflexive Banach space, Y be a Banach space and be a bounded, bilinear form satisfying the following two conditions:

A is non-degenerate with respect to the second variable, i.e., for each [formula], there exists x∈X with A(x,y)  ≠  0.

There exists c > 0 such that for all x∈X.

Then, for every y*∈Y*, there exists a unique x∈X with for all y∈Y.

Let T:X  →  Y* with 〈Tx,y〉 = A(x,y), for all x∈X and all y∈Y. Obviously T is a bounded, linear map. Since, by (b), [formula], for all x∈X, T is one-to-one. To complete the proof we need to show that T is onto.

Since A is non-degenerate with respect to the second variable, we have that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

and so, by [\cite=Meg],

[formula]

Thus to show that T maps X onto Y* we need to prove that T(X) is w*-closed in Y*. To see that let {Txλ}λ∈Λ be a net in T(X) and y* be an element of Y* such that Without loss of generality we may assume, using the special case of the Krein-mulian Theorem on w*-closed linear subspaces (see [\cite=Meg]), the proof of which is originally due to Banach [\cite=Banach] for the separable case and to Dieudonné [\cite=Dieudonne] for the general case, that {Txλ}λ∈Λ is bounded. Thus, since [formula], for all x∈X, the net {xλ}λ∈Λ is also bounded. Hence, since X is reflexive, there exist a subnet {xλμ}μ∈M and an element x of X such that {xλμ}μ∈M converges weakly to x. Since T is w - w* continuous [formula]. Hence Tx = y* and so T(X) is w*-closed.

An alternative proof of the previous lemma can be obtained using the Closed Range Theorem.

We are now in a position to prove our main result for the linear case.

Let X be a reflexive Banach space, Y be a Banach space, Λ be a directed set, {Xλ}λ∈Λ be a family of closed subspaces of X, {Yλ}λ∈Λ be an upwards directed family of closed subspaces of Y and [formula]. Suppose that is a function for which the following hold:

[formula] is a bounded bilinear form, for all λ∈Λ.

A(  ·  ,v) is a bounded linear functional on X, for all v∈V.

Aλ is non-degenerate with respect to the second variable, for all λ∈Λ.

There exists c > 0 such that, for all λ∈Λ, for all x∈Xλ.

Then, for each bounded linear functional v* on V, there exists x∈X such that for all v∈V.

Let v*∈V* and, for each λ∈Λ, let [formula]. For all λ∈Λ, v*λ is a bounded linear functional on Yλ. By hypothesis, for all λ∈Λ, Aλ is a bounded bilinear form on Xλ  ×  Yλ satisfying the two conditions of Lemma [\ref=lemma1]. Since, for all λ∈Λ, Xλ is a reflexive Banach space, we get that for each λ∈Λ there exists a unique xλ such that Aλ(xλ,y) = 〈v*λ,y〉, for all y∈Yλ. Since A satisfies condition (d), we get that, for all λ∈Λ, So {xλ}λ∈Λ is a bounded net in X. Since X is reflexive, there exist a subnet {xλμ}μ∈M of {xλ}λ∈Λ and x in X such that {xλμ}μ∈M converges weakly to x.

We are going to prove that A(x,v) = 〈v*,v〉, for all v∈V. Take v∈V. Then there exists some λ0∈Λ with v∈Yλ0. Since {xλμ}μ∈M is a subnet of {xλ}λ∈Λ, there exists some μ0∈M with λμ0  ≥  λ0. Hence, since the family {Yλ}λ∈Λ is upwards directed, for all μ  ≥  μ0. Thus, for all μ  ≥  μ0, Therefore Since A(  ·  ,v) is a bounded linear functional on X Hence A(x,v) = 〈v*,v〉.

The following example illustrates the possible applicability of Theorem [\ref=theorem3].

Let a∈C1(0,1) be a decreasing function with [formula] and a(t)  ≥  0, for all t∈(0,1). We will establish the existence of a solution for the following Cauchy problem:

[formula]

where f∈L2(0,1).

Let X = {u∈H1(0,1)|u(0) = 0} equipped with the norm [formula], which is equivalent to the original Sobolev norm, and Y = L2(0,1). Note that X is a reflexive Banach space, being a closed subspace of H1(0,1). Let [formula] be a decreasing sequence in (0,1) with [formula]. Define (we can consider Xn and Yn as closed subspaces of X and Y respectively, by extending their elements by zero outside (αn,1)). Also let [formula].

Let [formula] be the bilinear map defined by A is well-defined and A(  ·  ,v) is a bounded linear functional on X for any v∈V.

Let An = A|Xn  ×  Yn. An is a bounded, bilinear form since where Mn is the bound of a on

[formula]

The nonlinear case

We start by recalling some well-known definitions:

Let T:X  →  X* be an operator. We say that T is:

monotone if 〈Tx - Ty,x - y〉  ≥  0, for all x,  y∈X.

hemicontinuous if, for all x,  y∈X, [formula] as t  →  0+.

coercive if

We also need the following generalization of the notion of type M operator (for the classical definition see [\cite=Brezis] or [\cite=Zeidler]).

Let X be a Banach space, V be a linear subspace of X and be a function. We say that A is of type M with respect to V if, for any net {vλ}λ∈Λ in V, x∈X and v*∈V*,

[formula]

A(vλ,v)  →  〈v*,v〉, for all v∈V

A(vλ,vλ)  →  〈*,x〉, where * is the extension of v* on the closure of V

imply that A(x,v) = 〈v*,v〉, for all v∈V.

Our result is the following:

Let X be a reflexive Banach space, Λ be a directed set, {Xλ}λ∈Λ be an upwards directed family of closed subspaces of X and [formula]. Suppose that is a function for which the following hold:

A is of type M with respect to V.

[formula].

Aλ(x,  ·  )∈X*λ, for all λ∈Λ and all x∈Xλ, where Aλ is the restriction of A on Xλ  ×  Xλ.

The operator Tλ:Xλ  →  X*λ, defined by 〈Tλx,y〉 = Aλ(x,y), for all x,y∈Xλ, is monotone and hemicontinuous, for all λ∈Λ.

Then for each v*∈V* there exists x∈X such that for all v∈V.

As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem3], for each λ∈Λ, let [formula]. By the Browder-Minty Theorem (see [\cite=Zeidler]), a monotone, coercive and hemicontinuous operator, from a real reflexive Banach space into its dual, is onto. Thus, by (b) and (d), for each λ∈Λ, the operator Tλ is onto and so there exists xλ∈Xλ such that for all y∈Xλ. In particular Aλ(xλ,xλ) = 〈v*λ,xλ〉 and hence, by (b), we get that the net {xλ}λ∈Λ is bounded. Continuing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem3] and applying the fact that A is of type M with respect to V we get the required result.

It should be noted that, since a crucial point in the above proof is the existence and boundedness of the net {xλ}λ∈Λ, variants of the previous theorem could be obtained using in (b) and (d) alternative conditions corresponding to other surjectivity results.

We now apply Theorem [\ref=theorem4] to a singular Dirichlet problem.

Let Ω be a bounded domain in [formula]. We consider the Dirichlet problem

[formula]

where a∈L∞loc(Ω) and there exists c1 > 0 such that a(x)  ≥  c1 a.e. on Ω and [formula] is a monotone increasing (with respect to its second variable for each fixed x∈Ω), Carathéodory function, for which there exist h∈L2(Ω) and c2 > 0 such that

[formula]

We will show that if the above hypotheses on a and f hold, then problem ([\ref=equation2]) has a weak solution, i.e. that there exists a function u∈H10(Ω) with

[formula]

To this end let X = H10(Ω), [formula] be an increasing sequence of open subsets of Ω such that [formula] and

[formula]

and Xn = H10(Ωn), for each [formula]. Observe that we can consider each Xn as a closed subspace of X by extending its elements by zero outside Ωn and let

[formula]

Finally let be the function defined by

By a(x)  ≥  c1 a.e. on Ω, the monotonicity of f and the growth condition ([\ref=growth]), we have

[formula]

Since by the Poincaré inequality [formula] is equivalent to the norm of X it follows that A is coercive.

Let An = A|Xn  ×  Xn. Then, since a∈L∞loc(Ω) it follows that a∈L∞(Ωn), for all [formula]. Combining this with ([\ref=growth]), we have that

[formula]

where c(u,n) is a positive constant depending on n and u. So the operator

[formula]

with 〈Tnu,v〉Xn = An(u,v) is well-defined, for all [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the operators defined by

[formula]

Then T1,n is a monotone bounded linear operator. Using the monotonicity of f, it is easy to see that T2,n is monotone. Finally, recalling that the Nemytskii operator corresponding to f is continuous (see for example [\cite=Zeidler]) and that the embedding of Xn into L2(Ωn) is compact we have that T2,n is hemicontinuous. Thus Tn = T1,n + T2,n is monotone and hemicontinuous, for all [formula].

To finish the proof let [formula] in X. Then since, for all v∈V,

[formula]

is a bounded linear functional and, by the continuity of the Nemytskii operator and the compactness of the embedding of X into L2(Ω),

[formula]

for all v∈V, we get that

[formula]

Thus A is of type M with respect to V. Applying now Theorem [\ref=theorem4] we get that there exists u∈X such that A(u,v) = 0, for all v∈V. Observing that C∞0(Ω) is contained in V we get that u is the required weak solution of ([\ref=equation2]).
