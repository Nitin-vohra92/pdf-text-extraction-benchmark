The antipode of a dual quasi-Hopf algebra with nonzero integrals is bijective

Introduction

The definition of quasi-Hopf algebras and the dual notion of dual quasi-Hopf algebras is motivated by quantum physics and dates back to work of Drinfel'd [\cite=D]. The theory of integrals for quasi-Hopf algebras was studied in [\cite=pvo] [\cite=hn] [\cite=bc]. In [\cite=bc], Bulacu and Caenepeel showed that a dual quasi-Hopf algebra is co-Frobenius as a coalgebra if and only if it has a nonzero integral. In this case, the space of integrals is one-dimensional and the antipode is injective, so that for finite dimensional dual quasi-Hopf algebras the antipode is bijective. In this note, we use the ideas from a new short proof of the bijectivity of the antipode for Hopf algebras by the second author [\cite=i] to show that the antipode of a dual quasi-Hopf algebra with integrals is bijective, thus extending the classical result of Radford [\cite=R] for Hopf algebras.

In this paper we prove

Let H be a co-Frobenius dual quasi-Hopf algebra, equivalently, a dual quasi-Hopf algebra having nonzero integrals. Then the antipode of H is bijective.

Preliminaries

In this section we briefly review the definition of a dual quasi-Hopf algebra over a field K. We refer the reader to [\cite=abe] [\cite=dnr] [\cite=sw] for the basic definitions and properties of coalgebras and their comodules and of Hopf algebras. For the definition of dual quasi-Hopf algebra we follow [\cite=M].

Here we use Sweedler's sigma notation with the summation symbol omitted.

Let H be a dual quasi-Hopf algebra. As in the Hopf algebra case, a left integral on H is an element T∈H* such that h*T = h*(1)T for all h*∈H*; the space of left integrals is denoted by [formula] and by [\cite=bc] has dimension 0 or 1. Right integrals are defined analogously with space of right integrals denoted by [formula]. Suppose [formula]. It is easily seen that [formula] is a two sided ideal of the algebra H*, and KT  ⊆  Rat(H*) with right comultiplication given by [formula]. Since for co-Frobenius coalgebras [formula], KT must have left comultiplication [formula]. By coassociativity, a is a grouplike element, called the distinguished grouplike of H. Then, for all h*∈H*,

[formula]

From [\cite=bc], the function [formula]

[formula]

is an isomorphism of right H-comodules, where [formula] is defined by [formula], σ- 1 is the convolution inverse of σ, and, as usual, [formula].

Proof of the theorem

Let H be a quasi-Hopf algebra with [formula]. As in [\cite=i], for each right H-comodule (M,ρ), we denote by [formula] the left H-comodule structure on M defined by [formula], where [formula]. Denote the induced right H*-module structure on [formula] by m  ·  ah* = h*(ma- 1)ma0  =  h*(aS(m1))m0. By [\cite=bc] the antipode S of H is injective, and therefore has a left inverse Sl. Then, for σ as above, we have the following analogue of [\cite=i]:

The map p:aH  →  Rat(H*) defined by

[formula]

is a surjective morphism of left H-comodules.

Let [formula]. Then for c*∈H* and g∈H:

[formula]

Thus p is left H-colinear. Finally, we note that [formula] where θ* is the isomorphism from ([\ref=e7]) so that p is surjective.

Let c be a grouplike element of H. From [\cite=bc], c is invertible with inverse S(c). We will show that left multiplication by c has an inverse too.

Let θc∈End(H) be defined by θc(h) = ch and define the coinner automorphisms qc and rc  =  q- 1c∈End(H) by:

[formula]

For any grouplike element c and θc,rc,qc as above, [formula] and thus θc is bijective with inverse [formula].

Using ([\ref=e1]) and the fact that c- 1 = S(c), we see that

[formula]

The same formula for c- 1 = S(c) yields [formula] and the statement then follows directly.

We can now prove our main result. Proof of Theorem [\ref=TH]. We only need to prove the surjectivity. The proof goes along the lines of the proof of [\cite=i], but with the difference that here the antipode is not necessarily an anti-morphism of algebras.

Let π be the composition map [formula], where the last two isomorphisms follow by left-right symmetry of the results of [\cite=bc]. Since H is a co-Frobenius coalgebra, H H is projective by [\cite=GTN] or [\cite=bc], and as π is surjective, there is a morphism of left H-comodules [formula] such that πλ  =  IdH. We then have

[formula]

Applying [formula], we get aS(επ(λ(h)1)λ(h)2) = h for any h∈H. Thus [formula] is surjective and since θa is bijective by Lemma [\ref=theta], S is surjective also. [formula]
