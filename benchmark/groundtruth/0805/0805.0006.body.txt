Campedelli surfaces with fundamental group of order 8

Rita Pardini*   Miles Reid

Introduction

Let Y be a minimal surface of general type with K2Y = 16 and pg = 7, q = 0, having a free action by a group G of order 8. Write [formula] for the 1-canonical map, with image [formula]. We prove the following:

The surface [formula] is the complete intersection of 4 quadrics. It is isomorphic to the canonical model of Y.

Theorem [\ref=main] is known if [formula] by Miyaoka [\cite=miyaoka], Theorem B; in this case there are four linearly independent diagonal quadrics through [formula], which necessarily form a regular sequence defining [formula]. We thus assume throughout that G is a group of order 8 and contains an element of order 4.

Let S be a Campedelli surface and π:Y  →  S an etale cover of degree 8. Then Y is the universal cover of S and the covering group [formula] is the topological fundamental group π1S.

The dihedral group D4 of order 8 is not the fundamental group of a Campedelli surface.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main] consists of two parts, the first of which is now quite standard (compare Reid [\cite=Re2], Naie [\cite=Na], Konno [\cite=Ko]):

The canonical linear system |KY| on Y is free and defines a morphism [formula] that is birational to its image.

If [formula] is not a complete intersection of four quadrics, its quadric hull (the intersection of all quadrics containing [formula]) is a 3-fold X of degree 4, 5 or 6.

Moreover, in these three cases, [formula] is contained in a hypersurface Fd of [formula] not containing X, of degree d = 6,4,3 respectively.

The second part analyses the possible cases [formula], with ad hoc arguments involving the G-action to rule out each case; see Section [\ref=s!allX].

The background

A Campedelli surface is a surface S of general type with pg = 0, K2 = 2. The algebraic fundamental group [formula] classifies finite etale covers Y  →  S, and is the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group π1S. Results of Beauville [\cite=Be] and Reid [\cite=Re1], [\cite=Re2] (see also Mendes Lopes and Pardini [\cite=3chi]) guarantee that S has no irregular covers, and that an etale cover Y  →  S has degree [formula]. The reasons underlying [\cite=Re1], Theorem [\ref=main] and all related results are as follows:

It seems most likely that all groups of order [formula] except the dihedral groups of order 8 and 6 occur as π1S. The case |π1S| = 9 was treated in detail in Mendes Lopes and Pardini [\cite=MP3]. Here we treat |π1S| = 8, patching up the incomplete manuscript [\cite=Re2]. Naie [\cite=Na] obtained similar results for |π1S| = 6 using similar methods. Campedelli surfaces with [formula] and [formula] are contained in passing in Barlow [\cite=Ba]. Beauville [\cite=Be2] constructs a family of Calabi-Yau 3-folds with π1 the quaternion group H8, and Campedelli surfaces with the same π1 are obtained by taking the unique invariant section X1 = 0 of this.

Representations of G and proof of Corollary [\ref=dihedral]

Let Y  →  S be the universal cover of a Campedelli surface with group G. Then G acts naturally on H0(KY) and H0(2KY). Since the G-action is free, H0(KY) is the regular representation of G minus the trivial rank 1 representation, and H0(2KY) is three times the regular representation (for example, by [\cite=ypg]). Finally, the G-equivariant multiplication map

[formula]

is surjective by Theorem [\ref=main].

These remarks allow one to show that the group G is not the dihedral group, and to describe explicitly Y and the G-action for all the remaining groups of order 8.

Let G = D4 be the dihedral group of order 8. Write 1 for the trivial rank 1 representation, and ρ for the sole irreducible rank 2 representation; let [formula], χ2 and χ3 be the remaining rank 1 representations. Then

[formula]

Using the decomposition of H0(KY), one computes:

[formula]

Clearly the equivariant map [\eqref=eq!mult] cannot be surjective. This contradicts Theorem [\ref=main] and proves Corollary [\ref=dihedral].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop!1]

The canonical map [formula] is a morphism by Ciliberto, Mendes Lopes and Pardini [\cite=cmp] and is birational to its image [formula] by [\cite=cmp]. Thus [formula] is an irreducible surface of degree 16. Since

[formula]

the multiplication map S2H0(Y,KY)  →  H0(Y,2KY) has kernel of dimension [formula]; that is, [formula] is contained in at least 4 linearly independent quadrics.

Let Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 be four linearly independent quadrics through [formula]. We are home if [formula] is an irreducible component of [formula]. For in turn, if any of Q1 or [formula] or [formula] or [formula] is reducible, then [formula]. This is impossible, so [formula] is a complete intersection of 4 quadrics. Then [formula] is Gorenstein with [formula] and [formula]. Therefore it has canonical singularities and is the canonical model of Y.

Write [formula] for the quadric hull of [formula], the intersection of all the quadrics through [formula], following [\cite=Re3] and Konno [\cite=Ko]. The alternative to [formula] a complete intersection of four quadrics is that [formula] has a component X strictly containing [formula]. Then X is a 3-fold of degree 4, 5 or 6 and is the unique component of [formula] containing [formula].

Indeed, by elementary inequalities due to Castelnuovo, an irreducible m-fold X spanning [formula] is contained in at most

[formula]

linearly independent quadrics. See for example the discussion in [\cite=Re3] or [\cite=Ko]. The equality [formula] follows by [\cite=Ko]. The estimate on d follows from ([\ref=eq!ineq]) or by [\cite=Ko].

Finally, in the three cases for d, crude estimates give that the restriction map

[formula]

has rank

[formula]

(compare [\cite=Re3] and [\cite=Ko]). This proves Proposition [\ref=prop!1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

We exclude the cases of Proposition [\ref=prop!1], (ii) by studying the G-action on [formula], treating separately the cases deg X = 4, 5 or 6. In any case, X is linearly normal, since [formula] is given by the complete canonical system, and is regular, since Y is.

G-invariant linear systems on Y

The following lemmas group together a number of restrictions on G-invariant linear systems on Y, that we use several times in what follows. Their proofs are applications of Principle [\ref=princ!16].

A G-invariant linear system |D| on Y with D2 = 2 has a fixed part.

Let |F| be a G-invariant pencil on Y with KYF  ≤  8. Then |F| is free and KYF = 8.

Let D  ⊂  |KY| be a G-invariant subsystem of projective dimension [formula]. Then one of the following holds:

D is free; or

D has base locus consisting of 8 transversal base points.

In particular, D is not composed with a pencil.

The case deg X = 4

In this case, by Fujita [\cite=Fuj1], X is either a quartic scroll [formula] with a + b + c = 4, or the cone over the Veronese surface [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop!1], (iii), there is a sextic hypersurface containing [formula] and not containing X.

If X is a scroll, the birational transform of its unique ruling by planes is a G-invariant pencil |F| on Y with KYF  ≤  6, contradicting Lemma [\ref=pencil].

If X is the cone over V4, the linear subsystem D  ⊂  |KY| formed by hyperplanes through its vertex define a G-equivariant map ψ:Y  →  V4. By Proposition [\ref=system], D is either free or has 8 simple base points. In the latter case, deg ψ = 2 contradicts [\cite=Be], as in Lemma [\ref=involution]. So D is free, and [formula] is a morphism of degree 4. The G-action on [formula] fixes some point [formula] by Lemma [\ref=l!fPP2] below, whereas [formula] consists of [formula] points or trees of - 2-curves, on which G cannot act freely. This is a contradiction.

Let G be a group of order 2r acting on [formula]. Then there is a point [formula] fixed by the whole of G.

The case deg X = 5

This is the hard case of the proof, and we break it into several steps.

Recall from the start of the proof that we assume that X is linearly normal and regular. By [\cite=Fuj3] (or [\cite=Fuj2] in the nonsingular case) X is either a normal del Pezzo variety of index 2 or a cone from a point vertex over a (weak) del Pezzo surface [formula]. If X is a cone, the subsystem D  ⊂  |KY| given by hyperplanes through its vertex defines a G-equivariant map ψ:Y  →  V5. By Proposition [\ref=system], ψ is onto the surface V5, and

[formula]

provides a contradiction.

If [formula] is positive dimensional, it contains a single line L ([\cite=Fuj3]). Apply Proposition [\ref=system] to the subsystem D  ⊂  |KY| given by hyperplanes of [formula] through L; then D has no fixed part, so L is not contained in [formula].

Let Σ be a general hyperplane section of X and set [formula]. The surface Σ is a (possibly singular) del Pezzo surface of degree 5, nonsingular along C by Step 2, so that C is a Cartier divisor on Σ. Write [formula] for the restriction of a hyperplane to Σ. Since AC =  - KΣC = 16, the index theorem gives [formula], so C2  ≤  51. The curve C is the birational image of a general canonical curve of Y, so has geometric genus 17. On the other hand, the arithmetic genus of C  ⊂  Σ is given by [formula]. There are thus two possibilities:

C2 = 48 and C is nonsingular, or

C2 = 50 and C has a single node or cusp.

If case (b) holds for the general hyperplane section of [formula], the codimension 1 part of the singular locus of [formula] is a line L, necessarily invariant under the action of G. The system of hyperplanes through L then give the same contradiction to Proposition [\ref=system] as in Step 2.

We continue to use the notation of Step 3. The canonical class of C calculated on Y is KC = (KY + C)|C  =  OC(2A). Calculated on Σ, it is [formula]. Therefore the Cartier divisor D = C - 3A on Σ restricted to C is linearly equivalent to zero. Consider the exact sequence of sheaves on Σ:

[formula]

Since H1(Σ, - 3A) = 0 by Kodaira vanishing, or by well known results on del Pezzo surfaces, it follows that [formula], so D is a Cartier divisor linearly equivalent to an effective divisor.

Now [formula], and D2 = 48 - 96 + 45 =  - 3. This is a contradiction. Indeed, AD = 1 and A very ample implies that D is a line on Σ. But then D is nonsingular, and because it is a Cartier divisor, Σ is nonsingular near D, so D2 =  - 1.

The case deg X = 6

Assume deg X = 6. By Proposition [\ref=prop!1] and its proof, the linear system of cubics of [formula] containing [formula] restricts on X to a positive dimensional linear system |N| of surfaces of degree 2. Now X is not ruled by planes (because it is linearly normal of degree 6 and regular), so that the moving part of |N| must be a pencil of quadrics.

The birational transform of |N| on Y is then a G invariant pencil |F| with KYF  ≤  6 and contradicts Lemma [\ref=pencil].
