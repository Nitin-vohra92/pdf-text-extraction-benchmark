Natural equivariant Dirac operators

Introduction

The representation-valued equivariant index of a transversally elliptic operator is an important invariant in K-theory (see [\cite=A]). There are few known nontrivial examples in the literature where this invariant is explicitly computed. Part of the motivation of this paper is to provide an interesting and sufficiently general class of examples of transversally elliptic differential operators for which such computations are possible.

It is well-known that each compactly supported K-theory class of the cotangent bundle over an even-dimensional spinc manifold is represented by the symbol of a Dirac-type operator. This implies that Dirac-type symbols map onto the image of the K-theory index homomorphism. In this paper, we will generalize the second fact to the case of transversally elliptic operators over a compact manifold endowed with a compact Lie group action. The role of the Dirac-type operators will be played by a new class of transversally elliptic differential operators introduced in this paper. To construct these operators, we lift the group action to a principal bundle so that all orbits in the principal bundle have the same dimension. There is a natural transversal Dirac operator associated to this action. This operator induces a transversally elliptic differential operator on the base manifold with the desired properties. In the case when all orbits have the same dimension, the orbits on the base manifold form a Riemannian foliation, and our construction produces a transversal Dirac operator as studied by [\cite=GlK], [\cite=Hab], [\cite=BrKRi], [\cite=DouglasGlK], [\cite=Jung1], [\cite=Jung2], and others. This new operator will generate all possible values of the representation-valued equivariant index. Further, we show that the decomposition of this equivariant index representation into irreducible components may be computed by means of equivariant indices of elliptic operators. Thus, the techniques of Atiyah and Segal [\cite=ASe] for elliptic operators become applicable to transversally elliptic operators as well.

Now we describe the content of the paper. Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold. Let Q  ⊂  TM be a smooth distribution over M; we do not assume that Q or its normal bundle are involutive. Section [\ref=RestrCliffBundlesSection] contains preliminary results about connections associated to restrictions of Clifford structures. In Section [\ref=transverseDiracDistributions], we assume only that E  →  M is a [formula]-bundle with corresponding compatible Clifford connection. Such a connection always exists if E is in addition a [formula]-bundle; see Section [\ref=RestrCliffBundlesSection]. Using this [formula] connection, we construct an operator DQ whose principal symbol [formula] is invertible for all [formula] and prove that it is essentially self-adjoint. In the case of a Riemannian foliation with normal bundle Q, this construction produces the well-known self-adjoint version of the transversal Dirac operator (see [\cite=GlK], [\cite=Jung1], etc.).

In Section [\ref=EquivariantOpsFrameBndleSection], we assume that there is an isometric action of a compact Lie group G on M. The action of G lifts to the orthonormal frame bundle FO of M. Given an equivariant transversal Dirac operator on FO and irreducible representation of the orthogonal group, we show how to construct a transversally elliptic operator on M. Similarly, using the transversal Dirac operator and an irreducible representation of G, we construct an elliptic operator on [formula]. The precise relationship between the eigenspaces of these two operators is stated in Proposition [\ref=SpectraSame].

In Section [\ref=topPropertiesSection], we study the equivariant index of the K-theory class of operators constructed in Section [\ref=EquivariantOpsFrameBndleSection]. To do this, we first derive a multiplicative property of the equivariant index on associated fiber bundles with compact fibers. This property, stated in Theorem [\ref=EquivariantMultiplicativeTheorem], is a generalization of the multiplicative property of the index for sphere bundles shown by Atiyah and Singer in [\cite=ASi1]. The main result of Section [\ref=topPropertiesSection] is Theorem [\ref=indexClassGivenByTransvDiracThm], in which we show that the symbols of the lifted transversal Dirac operators generate all the possible equivariant indices, if the FO is G-transversally spinc.

In Section [\ref=ExampleSection], we demonstrate our constructions of the lifted transversal Dirac operator and verify our results by explicit calculations on the two-sphere.

The reader may consult [\cite=A] for the basic properties of transversally elliptic equivariant operators and their equivariant indices. Interesting and relevant results also appear in [\cite=ASe], [\cite=B-G-V], [\cite=Be-V1], [\cite=Be-V2], [\cite=Bra3], [\cite=BrKRi], and [\cite=Paradan].

Restrictions of Clifford structures

Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold with metric [formula], and let E be a Clifford bundle over M. Recall that a Clifford bundle E is a complex Hermitian vector bundle endowed with a Clifford action [formula] and a connection [formula] compatible with this action and the metric. Let Q be a subbundle of TM, and let L be the orthogonal complement of Q in TM. The Levi-Civita connection [formula] induces a connection [formula] on Q by the following formula. Given any section Y∈ΓQ and any vector field [formula], define

[formula]

where π:TM  →  Q is the orthogonal bundle projection. It is elementary to check that Formula ([\ref=Qconnection]) yields a metric connection on Q (with the restricted metric).

Note that this connection is not generally Q-torsion-free, because the torsion-free property is equivalent to the integrability of Q (i.e. [formula]).

We now modify the connection [formula] so that it has the desired compatibility with [formula]. Every metric connection [formula] on E satisfieswhere BX is a skew-Hermitian endomorphism of E that is [formula]-linear in X. In order that [formula] is a [formula]-connection compatible with [formula], we must have that if [formula], Y∈ΓQ, s∈ΓE,By ([\ref=Qconnection]) we see thator

[formula]

Computing with a local orthonormal frame [formula] for L, we have

[formula]

Then ([\ref=cliffordRequirement]) implies thatorWe conclude that the requirement that [formula] is a [formula]-connection defines BX (and thus [formula] ) up to a skew-adjoint endomorphism of E that commutes with Clifford multiplication by vectors in Q. We may always takeThis choice of BX (and thus [formula] ) is well-defined and canonical, since the formula is independent of the local orthonormal frame for L.

We now show how to express BX in terms of any local orthonormal frame f1,...,fq for Q.

[formula]

Observe that this expression for BX is the same as the original expression for BX with Q replaced by L. We have shown the following.

Let M be a closed Riemannian manifold, and let [formula] be a Hermitian Clifford bundle over M. Let Q be a subbundle of TM, and let [formula] denote the metric connection on Q defined by [formula], where π:TM  →  Q is the orthogonal bundle projection. Then the connection [formula] defined byfor all [formula] is a well-defined [formula]-connection and a metric connection on E with respect to the connection [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is a [formula]-connection and a metric connection on E with respect to the connection [formula].

Transverse Dirac Operators for Distributions

We showed in Section [\ref=RestrCliffBundlesSection] that, for a given distribution Q  ⊂  TM, it is always possible to obtain a bundle of [formula]-modules with Clifford connection from a bundle of [formula]-Clifford modules. In this section, we will assume more generally that a [formula]-module structure on a complex Hermitian vector bundle E is given and will define transverse Dirac operators on sections of E. As in Section [\ref=RestrCliffBundlesSection], M is a closed Riemannian manifold with metric [formula], [formula] is the Clifford multiplication on E, and [formula] is a [formula] connection that is compatible with the metric on M; that is, Clifford multiplication by each vector is skew-Hermitian, and we requirefor all [formula], V∈ΓQ, and s∈ΓE. Note that the connection [formula] from Section [\ref=RestrCliffBundlesSection] is an example of such a connection, but not all such [formula] connections are of that type. Let [formula], let [formula] be a local orthonormal frame for Q, and let π:TM  →  Q be the orthogonal projection. We define the Dirac operator AQ corresponding to the distribution Q as

[formula]

This definition is independent of the choices made; in fact it is the composition of the maps We calculate the formal adjoint. Letting [formula] denote the pointwise inner product of sections of E, we have that

[formula]

where ω is the one-form defined by [formula] for X∈ΓQ and is zero for X∈ΓL. Continuing,

[formula]

where the orthogonal projection [formula] is denoted by π as well. In what follows, let [formula] be an orthonormal frame of L, and let [formula] [formula] on forms. The divergence of a general one-form β that is zero on L is

[formula]

Letting [formula] then

[formula]

where HL is the mean curvature vector field of L. Thus, for every one-form β that is zero on L , Applying this result to the form ω defined above, we have

[formula]

Thus, the formal adjoint [formula] of AQ isand the operator

[formula]

is formally self-adjoint.

A quick look at [\cite=C] yields the following.

For each distribution Q  ⊂  TM and every bundle E of [formula]-modules, the transversally elliptic operator DQ defined by ([\ref=AQdef]) and ([\ref=DQdef]) is essentially self-adjoint.

It is not necessarily the case that the spectrum of DQ is discrete, as the following example shows.

We consider the torus [formula] with the metric [formula] for some 2π-periodic smooth function g. Consider the orthogonal distributions [formula] and [formula]. Let E be the trivial complex line bundle over M, and let [formula] and [formula] both act on E via [formula]. The connections [formula] and [formula] satisfy

[formula]

The trivial connection [formula] is a [formula] connection with respect to [formula] and is also a [formula] connection with respect to [formula]. Observe that the mean curvatures of these distributions are

[formula]

From formulas ([\ref=AQdef]) and ([\ref=DQdef]),

[formula]

The spectrum [formula] is a set consisting of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity, and thus [formula] consists entirely of pure point spectrum. The eigenspace En corresponding to the eigenvalue n is and [formula] is dense in [formula].

On the other hand, the operatorhas only one eigenvalue, 0, corresponding to the eigenspace [formula]. Next, note that [formula] is an invariant subspace for DQ . The spectrum of the restriction of DQ to Fn is [formula], where [formula] is the range of [formula]. Thus, the spectrum [formula] isand the pure point spectrum of DQ is [formula].

Suppose a closed manifold M is endowed with a Riemannian foliation F such that the metric is bundlelike, meaning that the leaves are locally equidistant. If the orbits of a G-manifold have the same dimension, then they form a Riemannian foliation. In such foliations, there is a natural construction of transversal Dirac operators (see [\cite=BrKRi] , [\cite=GlK] , [\cite=La]), which is a special case of the construction in this section. Choose a local adapted frame field [formula] for the tangent bundle of M , such that [formula] is a local basis of the normal bundle NF for the foliation and such that each ej is a basic vector field for 1  ≤  j  ≤  q. The word basic means that the flows of those vector fields map leaves to leaves, and such a basis can be chosen near every point if and only if the foliation is Riemannian. Next, assume that we have a complex Hermitian vector bundle E  →  M that is a bundle of [formula] modules that is equivariant with respect to the G action, and let [formula] be the corresponding equivariant, metric, Clifford connection. We define the transversal Dirac operator by as in the notation of this section. As before, the operator is an essentially self-adjoint operator, where H is the mean curvature vector field of the orbits.

Equivariant operators on the frame bundle

Equivariant structure of the orthonormal frame bundle

Given a complete, connected G-manifold, the action of g∈G on M induces an action of dg on TM, which in turn induces an action of G on the principal [formula]-bundle [formula] of orthonormal frames over M.

The action of G on FO is regular, i.e. the isotropy subgroups corresponding to any two points of M are conjugate.

Let H be the isotropy subgroup of a frame f∈FO. Then H also fixes [formula], and since H fixes the frame, its differentials fix the entire tangent space at [formula]. Since it fixes the tangent space, every element of H also fixes every frame in [formula]; thus every frame in a given fiber must have the same isotropy subgroup. Since the elements of H map geodesics to geodesics and preserve distance, a neighborhood of [formula] is fixed by H. Thus, H is a subgroup of the isotropy subgroup at each point of that neighborhood. Conversely, if an element of G fixes a neighborhood of a point x in M, then it fixes all frames in [formula], and thus all frames in the fibers above that neighborhood. Since M is connected, we may conclude that every point of FO has the same isotropy subgroup H, and H is the subgroup of G that fixes every point of M.

Since this subgroup H is normal, we often reduce the group G to the group G / H so that our action is effective, in which case the isotropy subgroups on FO are all trivial.

In any case, the G orbits on FO are diffeomorphic and form a Riemannian fiber bundle, in the natural metric on FO defined as follows. The Levi-Civita connection on M determines the horizontal subbundle H of TFO. We construct the local product metric on FO using a biinvariant fiber metric and the pullback of the metric on M to H; with this metric, FO is a compact Riemannian [formula]-manifold. The lifted G-action commutes with the [formula]-action. Let F denote the foliation of G-orbits on FO, and observe that [formula] is a Riemannian submersion of compact [formula]-manifolds.

Let E  →  FO be a Hermitian vector bundle that is equivariant with respect to the [formula] action. Let [formula] and [formula] be irreducible unitary representations. We define the bundle Eσ  →  M by where the superscript σ is defined for a [formula]-module Z bywhere [formula] is the evaluation map [formula]. The space Zσ is the vector subspace of Z on which [formula] acts as a direct sum of representations of type σ. The bundle Eσ is a Hermitian G-vector bundle of finite rank over M. The metric on Eσ is chosen as follows. For any vx,wx∈Eσx, we definewhere dμx is the measure on [formula] induced from the metric on FO. See [\cite=BrKRi] for a similar construction.

Similarly, we define the bundle [formula] byand [formula] is a Hermitian [formula]-equivariant bundle of finite rank. The metric on Tρ iswhere dmz is the measure on [formula] induced from the metric on FO.

The vector spaces of sections [formula] and [formula] can be identified via the isomorphismwhere for any section [formula], [formula] for each x∈M, and we letfor every [formula]. Then [formula] is given byObserve that [formula] extends to an L2 isometry. Given u,v∈ [formula],

[formula]

where dx is the Riemannian measure on M; we have used the fact that p is a Riemannian submersion. Similarly, we letbe the natural identification, which extends to an L2 isometry.

LetSimilarly, let

For any irreducible representations [formula] and [formula], the map [formula] is an isomorphism (with inverse [formula]) that extends to an L2-isometry.

Observe that iσ implements the isomorphism

[formula]

to the space of sections of E of [formula] representation type σ. Its restriction to [formula] is

[formula]

where the superscript σ,ρ denotes restriction first to sections of [formula]-representation type [formula] and then to the subspace of sections of G-representation type [formula]. Since the [formula] and G actions commute, we may do this in the other order, so that

[formula]

where the isomorphism is the inverse of the restriction of jρ to [formula]. Since iσ and jρ are L2 isometries, the result follows.

Dirac-type operators on the frame bundle

Let E  →  FO be a Hermitian vector bundle of [formula] modules that is equivariant with respect to the [formula] action. With notation as in Example [\ref=RiemFoliationTrDiracExample], we have the transversal Dirac operator ANF defined by the composition As explained previously, the operator is a essentially self-adjoint [formula]-equivariant operator, where H is the mean curvature vector field of the G-orbits in FO.

From DNF we now construct equivariant differential operators on M and [formula], as follows. We define the operatorsandFor an irreducible representation [formula], let be the restriction of DσM to sections of G-representation type [formula]. Similarly, for an irreducible representation [formula], let be the restriction of [formula] to sections of [formula]-representation type [formula]. The proposition below follows from Theorem [\ref=IsomorphismsOfSectionsTheorem].

The operator DσM is transversally elliptic and G-equivariant, and [formula] is elliptic and [formula]-equivariant, and the closures of these operators are self-adjoint. The operators [formula] and [formula] have identical discrete spectrum, and the corresponding eigenspaces are conjugate via Hilbert space isomorphisms.

Thus, questions about the transversally elliptic operator DσM can be reduced to questions about the elliptic operators [formula] for each irreducible [formula].

Topological properties of the lifted Dirac operators

In this section, we will prove that if FO is G-transversally spinc, then the symbols of the lifted transversal Dirac operators generate all the possible equivariant indices. To show this, we generalize the standard multiplicative property of K-theory to the equivariant setting of our paper.

Equivariant Multiplicative Properties of K-theory

Let H be a compact Lie group. Suppose that P is a principal H-bundle over a compact manifold M. Suppose that the compact Lie group G acts on M and lifts to P, such that the G-action on P commutes with the H-action. Let [formula] be a fiber bundle associated to P with H-fiber Y; that is,Then G acts on Z via [formula].

For any v in the Lie algebra [formula] of G, let [formula] denote the fundamental vector field on M associated to v. As in [\cite=A], let and let [formula] be defined similarly. Let [formula] denote the G-equivariant, compactly supported K-group of [formula], which is isomorphic to the group of stable G-equivariant homotopy classes of transversally elliptic first-order symbols under direct sum. Likewise, [formula] is isomorphic to the group of the stable H-equivariant homotopy classes of first order elliptic symbols over Y.

We define a multiplicationas follows. Let u be a transversally elliptic, G-equivariant symbol over M taking values in [formula], and let v be a H-equivariant elliptic symbol over Y taking values in [formula]. First, we lift the symbol u to the H  ×  G-equivariant symbol û on P. Let [formula] be the standard K-theory multiplication (similar to [\cite=A]) An element [formula] acts on [formula] by

[formula]

Since the action of [formula] is free, we haveFinally we define to be the image of [formula] in [formula] under the isomorphism above.

Given any finite-dimensional unitary virtual H-representation τ on V, we may form the associated G-virtual bundle [formula] over M, defining a class in [formula]. The tensor product makes [formula] naturally into a [formula]-module; for each [formula], the symbol [formula] defines an element of [formula].

We let [formula] denote the virtual representation-valued index as explained in [\cite=A]; note that the result is a finite-dimensional virtual representation if the input is a symbol of an elliptic operator.

Let Z = P  ×  HY as above, with P a H-bundle over M. Let u be a transversally elliptic, G-equivariant symbol over M taking values in [formula], and let v be a H-equivariant elliptic symbol over Y taking values in [formula], so that u and v define classes [formula] and [formula] in [formula] and [formula], respectively. Then u  ·  v defines an element of [formula], and

We adopt the argument in [\cite=L-M] to our situation. Let L be a transversally elliptic, G-equivariant first order operator representing u, and let Q be an elliptic, H-equivariant first-order operator representing v. Let û be the lift of u to a H  ×  G-transversely elliptic symbol over P, and let L̂ be a transversally elliptic, H  ×  G-equivariant first order operator representing û. Next, consider operator product [formula] over P  ×  Y, which represents [formula]. This operator is H  ×  G equivariant with respect to the action ([\ref=HxGaction]). ThenandLet [formula] and [formula] be the restrictions of the operators D and [formula] to sections that are pullbacks of sections over the base Z = P  ×  HY, i.e. those that are H-invariant. Let τ+ denote the H-representation ker  Q, and let τ- be the representation ker  [formula]. By the definition of the H-action in ([\ref=HxGaction]), the decomposition yields the associated kernels

[formula]

We next decompose the above as G-representations, and we obtainThe result follows, since [formula] is stably homotopic to the principal symbol of [formula].

Index of Lifted Dirac operators

Suppose that [formula] is any transversally elliptic, G-equivariant operator with transversally elliptic symbol [formula], so that [formula]. If [formula] denotes the trivial [formula] representation over the identity, then let  v be any element of the class [formula] induced from the inclusion of the identity in [formula] via an extension of the Thom isomorphism (see [\cite=ASi1]). Observe that the equivariant index [formula] of the elliptic symbol v is equal to one copy of the trivial representation (see axioms of the equivariant index in [\cite=ASi1]). By Theorem [\ref=EquivariantMultiplicativeTheorem], G-equivariant transversally elliptic symbol u  ·  v defines an element of [formula] such that

[formula]

Suppose further that FO is G-transversally spinc. Then the class [formula] may be represented by the symbol of a transversally-elliptic, G-equivariant operator DNF of Dirac type.

Thus, the operator [formula] satisfies

[formula]

The result below follows.

Suppose that FO is G-transversally spinc. Then for every transversally elliptic symbol class [formula], there exists an operator of type [formula] such that [formula].

Example

A transversal Dirac operator on the sphere

Let G = S1 act on [formula] by rotations about the z-axis. Let p:FO  →  S2 be the oriented orthonormal frame bundle. We will identify FO with [formula] by letting the first row denote the point on S2 and the last two rows denote the framing of the tangent space. We choose the metric on FO to be The action of S1 lifted to FO is given by multiplication on the right: Tangent vectors to FO are elements of the Lie algebra and the tangent space to the S1 action is the span of the left-invariant vector field T induced by [formula] at the identity. Thus, the normal bundle of the corresponding foliation on FO is trivial. It is the subbundle NS1 of TFO that is given at A∈FO by The vectors [formula], [formula] and the orbit direction [formula] are mutually orthogonal. Let [formula] be the trivial bundle. The action of [formula] on fibers of E is defined by [formula] [formula]. We identify the vectors [formula] and [formula] with the left-invariant fields V1 and V2 in [formula]. We assume that the S1-action on E is trivial. As in Example [\ref=RiemFoliationTrDiracExample], the transversal Dirac operator is where [formula] is the directional derivative in the direction Vj. Since the length of each orbit of the S1 action is constant, the mean curvature vector is zero.

The bundle FO  →  S2 is an [formula] principal bundle and comes equipped with an action of [formula] on the frames over a point. The left action ofon a frame [formula] is given byAgain, we extend this action trivially to the [formula] bundle. Note that DNF is equivariant with respect to both the above left [formula] action and the right S1 action.

We choose the standard spherical coordinates [formula]. Let Pθ,φ denote parallel transport in the tangent bundle from the north pole along the minimal geodesic connected to [formula]. ThenWe parallel transport the standard frame [formula] at the north pole to get Xθ,φ = Pθ,φe1, Yθ,φ = Pθ,φe2, and the we rotate by α to get all possible frames. The result is a coordinate chart [formula] defined by

A section u is defined to be of irreducible representation type [formula] if it satisfies [formula]. Since the action of [formula] on the fibers of E is trivial, we have

[formula]

Thus, it suffices to calculate [formula] at [formula].

The lower hemisphere coordinates of the point and vectors would have the opposite third coordinate, and the sign of Xθ,φ is reversed in addition to ensure that the frame is oriented. Note that the φ in the lower hemisphere is [formula] in the upper hemisphere. Thus the second chart is [formula]One can check that Thus, the clutching function for the frame bundle is multiplication on the left by e2θi.

Next, suppose that u is a section such that [formula]. This means in fact that [formula] in both charts. Thus we may trivialize the bundle by restricting to [formula] in each chart. We observe

and thus the clutching function for [formula] is e2nθi.

One may express the vector fields V1, V2 in terms of the coordinate vector fields ∂α,∂θ, ∂φ. In the upper hemisphere,

[formula]

Now we wish to consider the operatorwhere [formula]. We have

[formula]

There is a similar formula for [formula] in the lower hemisphere chart. Observe that

We easily check that right multiplication by [formula] on [formula] satisfies

If [formula] is a section of [formula] of type σn (with respect to the fiberwise action of [formula]) over the upper hemisphere, then

[formula]

using the upper hemisphere trivialization [formula] and equation ([\ref=leftMultiplicationFormula]).

If we assume that ψ:FO  →  Eσn is a section of type ρm with respect to the lifted S1 action, then [formula]. Thus, which impliesThe analogous calculation in the lower hemisphere chart yields

Calculation of ker  [formula]

Since [formula], we seek solutions to the equationin the upper hemisphere chart. From the equations [formula], ∂αψ1 =  - niψ1 (since [formula] ), and [formula] (since [formula]), we have

[formula]

Solving this equation, we obtainThis implies that ψ1 is

[formula]

in the complex coordinates of the projection of the upper hemisphere to the xy plane. Thus, ψ1 is smooth in the upper hemisphere only if n  ≥  m. Similarly, [formula], ∂αψ2 =  - niψ2, and [formula] implies

[formula]

Hence, ψ2 is smooth in the upper hemisphere only if m  ≥  n.

We need to see if the solutions ψ1 and ψ2 extend to solutions over the entire sphere. In the lower hemisphere, we have the equationSimilar computations show that

[formula]

in the complex coordinates of the projection of the lower hemisphere to the xy plane. Thus, ψ1 is smooth in the lower hemisphere only if n + m  ≤  0, and ψ2 is smooth in the lower hemisphere only if m + n  ≥  0.

In summary, we seek solutions to [formula] restricted to sections of Eσn of type ρm. The clutching function of Eσn is multiplication by e2nθi (i.e. z2n or [formula]), so that [formula].

The function ψ1 is continuous if and only if [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, ψ2 is continuous if and only if [formula] and [formula].

From the equations in the previous section, the index of DσnS2 restricted to sections of type ρm is

[formula]

Note that the kernel of DσnS2 is infinite-dimensional. The operator DσnS2 fails to be elliptic precisely at the points where cot φ = 0; that is, at the equator.

The operator on [formula]

We now construct the operator [formula]. First, observe that [formula] is again the sphere S2. The orbits of the action of G on FO are of the form [formula], with M∈FO. The map Rt rotates the first and second columns of the matrix, so that the map FO  →  S2 is the map to the third column. Thus, the projection of the vector V1 to TS2 is

Similarly,

A section of type ρm of [formula] is one for which the partial derivative in direction is multiplication by im. In the U1 coordinate chart (corresponding to [formula], 0  ≤  θ  ≤  2π, 0  ≤  α  ≤  2π), the quotient to [formula] goes to [formula], mapping to the entire upper hemisphere x  ≥  0, with fibers of the form [formula]. Thus, we may fix α = 0 for the sake of argument and allow θ  =  θ  -  α and φ to vary. The group S1 acts as before by [formula]. In particular, if ψ is a section of type ρm, [formula]. Thus, setting α = 0, we haveThus,

[formula]

So all sections of type ρm satisfy [formula] or ∂α =  - ∂θ - im.

Restricted to this space of sections, we haveThe interested reader may check that this operator is elliptic at all points of the hemisphere x  ≥  0. A similar statement is true in the other hemisphere. Thus, [formula] is elliptic, as expected.

The kernel of [formula] restricted to [formula] has dimension

[formula]

using the results preceding formula ([\ref=indexFormula]). As expected, for a given bundle Tρm, only a finite number of the representation types σn occur, and the kernel of [formula] on the space of all sections is finite-dimensional.
