FKWC-bases and geometrical identities for classical and quantum field theories in curved spacetime

Calculations which must be carried out in the context of field theories defined on curved spacetimes are non-trivial due to the systematic occurrence, in the expressions involved, of Riemann polynomials. These polynomials are formed from the Riemann tensor by covariant differentiation, multiplication and contraction and their complexity, degree and number rapidly increase with the precision of the approximations needed or with the dimension of the gravitational background considered. Furthermore, the results of these calculations may be darkened because of the non-uniqueness of their final forms. Indeed, the symmetries of the Riemann tensor as well as Bianchi identities can not be used in a uniform manner and monomials formed from the Riemann tensor may be linearly dependent in non-trivial ways. In Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992], Fulling, King, Wybourne and Cummings (FKWC) have proposed to cure these problems by expanding systematically the Riemann polynomials encountered in calculations on standard bases constructed from group theoretical considerations. They have also displayed such bases for scalar Riemann polynomials of order eight or less in the derivatives of the metric tensor and for tensorial Riemann polynomials of order six or less.

The FKWC-paper has been mainly used in supergravity and string theory but, unfortunately, it has been rather ignored by people working in the context of field theories in curved spacetime. This is a pity because it could be very helpful in order to simplify considerably a lot of calculations. In the present paper, we shall provide a slightly modified version of the FKWC-bases as well as a list of geometrical relations we have used in recent articles [\cite=DecaniniFolacci2005b] [\cite=DecaniniFolacci2007] dealing with renormalization of the stress-energy tensor or which, in our opinion, are important bearing in mind many other aspects of classical and quantum field theories in curved spacetime. The results displayed here are independent of the dimension of spacetime and they have permitted us to achieve rather quickly and easily, by hand, very tedious calculations as well as to provide irreducible expressions for all our results. The slight modification of the FKWC-bases has been mainly done in order to accelerate these calculations and more particularly the steps involving covariant differentiation and contraction of Riemann polynomials. We do not intend to publish our results in a regular scientific journal but we have decided to distribute them through the arXiv because we are confident they could be very helpful for other people working in gravitational physics and more particularly (i) to treat some aspects of the classical theory of gravitational waves such as the radiation reaction problem and (ii) to deal with regularization and renormalization of quantum field theories, of stochastic semiclassical gravity and of higher-order theories of gravity.

In this paper, we shall use the FKWC-notations Rrs,q and [formula] to denote respectively the space of Riemann polynomials of rank r (number of free indices), order s (number of differentiations of the metric tensor) and degree q (number of factors [formula]) and the space of Riemann polynomials of rank r spanned by contractions of products of the type [formula]. We refer to the FKWC-article [\cite=FKWC1992] for more precisions on these notations and rigor on the subject. Furthermore, we shall use the geometrical conventions of Hawking and Ellis [\cite=HawkingEllis] concerning the definitions of the scalar curvature R, the Ricci tensor Rμν and the Riemann tensor Rμνρσ. The geometrical identities we shall display below and which could be helpful in order to eliminate "spurious" Riemann monomials of order up to six by expressing them in terms of elements of FKWC-bases have been derived (i) from the commutation of covariant derivatives in the form

[formula]

and (ii) from the "symmetry" properties of the Ricci and the Riemann tensors (pair symmetry, antisymmetry, cyclic symmetry) as well as (iii) from the Bianchi identity and its consequences obtained by contraction of index pairs

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 0 (scalars) and orders up to six

The most general expression for a scalar of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 0 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of the 22 following elements or scalar Riemann monomials [\cite=FKWC1992]:

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 0 and order 2 (1 element).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 0 and order 4 (4 elements).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 0 and order 6 (17 elements).

[formula]

This basis is a natural one and is often used in this form in literature. However, it should be noted that certain authors prefer to use the scalar monomial [formula] instead of the scalar monomial Rpq;rsRprqs. This is the case of Gilkey in Refs. [\cite=Gilkey75] [\cite=Gilkey84]. This choice is only a matter of taste because these two terms appear equally in the calculations carried out in field theory and the elimination of one of them can be achieved by using the identity

[formula]

In the context of field theories in curved spacetime, other Riemann monomials of rank 0 and orders 4 or 6 such as RpqrsRrqps, [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula] can be encountered. They are not in the FKWC-basis ([\ref=FKWC_R0_O2])-([\ref=FKWC_R0_O6]) and they can be eliminated (i.e., expanded on the FKWC-basis) from the geometrical identities

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 1 (vectors) and orders up to 6

The most general expression for a covariant vector of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 1 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of the 8 following elements or vector Riemann monomials [\cite=FKWC1992]:

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 1 and order 3 (1 element).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 1 and order 5 (7 elements).

[formula]

Here, it should be noted that we have slightly modified the FKWC-basis of Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992]. Indeed, we have replaced the term Rpq;rRprqa proposed in Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by its opposite given by Rpq;rRrqpa for obvious mnemotechnic reasons.

In the context of field theories in curved spacetime, other Riemann monomials of rank 1 and order 5 such as [formula], [formula] and RpqrsRpqra;s can be encountered. They are not in the FKWC-basis ([\ref=FKWC_R1_O3])-([\ref=FKWC_R1_O5]) and they can be eliminated (i.e., expanded on the FKWC-basis) from the geometrical identities

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 2 and orders up to 6

The most general expression for a tensor of rank 2 (more precisely of type (0,2)) and of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 2 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of the 29 following elements [\cite=FKWC1992]:

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 2 and order 2 (1 element).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 2 and order 4 (6 elements).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 2 and order 6 (22 elements).

[formula]

Here again, we have slightly modified the FKWC-basis of Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992]:

i) In R2{2,0} we have replaced the term RpqRpa;qb proposed in Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by the term RpqRpa;bq. We think it is more interesting to work with the latter which directly reduces to an element of the scalar basis ([\ref=FKWC_R0_O2])-([\ref=FKWC_R0_O6]) by contraction on the free indices a and b. In fact, these two terms are linked by the geometrical identity

[formula]

so it is easy to return to the original FKWC-basis.

ii) We have replaced the term [formula] of R2{2,0}, the term Rpq;rRprqa;b of R2{1,1} and the term [formula] of R26,3 proposed in Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by their opposites respectively given by [formula], Rpq;rRrqpa;b and [formula]. This choice has been done for obvious mnemotechnic reasons.

In the context of field theories in curved spacetime, other Riemann monomials of rank 2 and orders 4 or 6 which are not in the FKWC-basis ([\ref=FKWC_R2_O2])-([\ref=FKWC_R2_O6]) are systematically encountered. They can be eliminated (i.e., expanded on the FKWC-basis) more or less trivially by using more particularly the 15 following geometrical identities:

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 3 and orders up to 6

The most general expression for a tensor of rank 3 (more precisely of type (0,3)) and of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 3 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of the 12 following elements [\cite=FKWC1992]:

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 3 and order 3 (1 element).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 3 and order 5 (11 elements).

[formula]

Here, we have modified the FKWC-basis of Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by choosing to omit their [formula] term which is explicitly antisymmetric on b and c and which vanishes by contraction on these indices because it can be expanded as

[formula]

In Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992], Fulling, King, Wybourne and Cummings have kept such a term because they have chosen to consider that [formula] does not generate any contribution antisymmetric in b and c.

In the context of field theories in curved spacetime, other Riemann monomials of rank 3 and order 5 such as [formula], [formula] and [formula] can be encountered. They are not in the FKWC-basis ([\ref=FKWC_R3_O3])-([\ref=FKWC_R3_O5]) and they can be eliminated (i.e., expanded on the FKWC-basis) from the geometrical identities

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 4 and orders up to 6

The most general expression for a tensor of rank 4 (more precisely of type (0,4)) and of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 4 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of the 48 following elements [\cite=FKWC1992]:

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 4 and order 2 (1 element).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 4 and order 4 (5 elements).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 4 and order 6 (42 elements).

It should be noted that we have modified the FKWC-basis of Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992]:

i) In R4{2,0} we have replaced the term [formula] proposed in Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by the term [formula] because it is more interesting to work with the latter which directly reduces to an element of the basis ([\ref=FKWC_R2_O2])-([\ref=FKWC_R2_O6]) by contraction on the free indices c and D. In fact, it is easy to return to the original FKWC-basis by using the geometrical identity

[formula]

which links these two Riemann monomials.

It is easy to return to the original FKWC-basis by using the geometrical identity

which links these two Riemann monomials.

iii) We have furthermore replaced the terms [formula] and [formula] of R46,3 which have been proposed in Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by their opposites [formula], [formula] for obvious mnemotechnic reasons.

iv) We have finally omitted in the original FKWC-basis of Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] the term [formula] in R44,2, the term [formula] in R4{1,1} and the terms [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], RpqrsRpqabRrscd, [formula] and [formula] in R46,3 because we prefer to expand them on the remaining terms as

They can be eliminated (i.e., expanded on the FKWC-basis) more or less trivially by using the "symmetry" properties of the Ricci and the Riemann tensors ([\ref=SymRicci])-([\ref=SymRiemann_Cycl]), the Bianchi identity and its consequences ([\ref=AppBianchi_1])-([\ref=AppBianchi_2b]) as well as from the commutation of covariant derivatives in the form ([\ref=CD_NabNabTensor]).

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 5 and orders up to 6

The most general expression for a tensor of rank 5 (more precisely of type (0,5)) and of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 5 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of the 9 following elements [\cite=FKWC1992]:

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 5 and order 3 (1 element).

[formula]

- Sub-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 5 and order 5 (8 elements).

[formula]

Here, we have modified the FKWC-basis of Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992] by choosing to omit their term [formula] explicitly antisymmetric in b and c and which vanishes by contraction on these indices because it can be expanded as

[formula]

Among the multitude of geometrical identities which can be obtained for the Riemann monomials of rank 5 and order 5 we only retain

[formula]

Furthermore, it should be noted that in field theory calculations at two-loop order in a four dimensional gravitational background or at one-loop order in higher dimensional background, only three of these Riemann monomials of rank 5 are used (Rab;cde, RabRcd;e and [formula]) because there is no other Riemann monomial of rank 5 present in the covariant Taylor series expansion of the Van Vleck-Morette determinant Δ1 / 2 (see Ref. [\cite=DecaniniFolacci2005a]).

FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 6 and orders up to 6

The most general expression for a tensor of rank 6 (more precisely of type (0,6)) and of order six or less in derivatives of the metric tensor is obtained by expanding it on the FKWC-basis for Riemann polynomials of rank 6 and order 6 or less. This basis is composed of 37 elements: 1 element in R64,1, 2 elements in R64,2, 1 element in R66,1, 9 elements in R6{2,0}, 6 elements in R6{1,1} and 18 elements in R66,3. This basis is fully described in Ref. [\cite=FKWC1992]. In field theory calculations at two-loop order in a four dimensional gravitational background or at one-loop order in higher dimensional background), we only need the 8 elements of this basis which are present in the covariant Taylor series expansion of the Van Vleck-Morette determinant Δ1 / 2 namely (see Ref. [\cite=DecaniniFolacci2005a]):
