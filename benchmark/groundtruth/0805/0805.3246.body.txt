On a Monge-Ampère type equation in the Cegrell class Eχ

Introduction

It is a classical problem in analysis to find, for given function F, solutions u to the equation:

[formula]

where (ddcu)n is the complex Monge-Ampère operator. Equations of the type ([\ref=intr]) has played a significant not only within the fields of fully nonlinear second order elliptic equations and pluripotential theory, but also in applications. We refer to [\cite=bt] [\cite=bt2] [\cite=ckns] [\cite=c] [\cite=cegrell_kolodziej] [\cite=kolweak] [\cite=krylov] and the reference therein for further information about equations of Monge-Ampère type.

In the last decade the so called Cegrell classes has played a prominent role in working with the complex Monge-Ampère operator. For further information about the Cegrell classes see e.g. [\cite=ahag_thesis] [\cite=ahag_Ff] [\cite=czyz_compl] [\cite=czyz_cegrell] [\cite=czyz_energy] [\cite=cegrell_energy] [\cite=cegrell_gdm] [\cite=cegrell_bdd]. Let [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] be as in [\cite=cegrell_energy] [\cite=cegrell_gdm] [\cite=cegrell_bdd].

In [\cite=bgz], Benelkourchi, Guedj, and Zeriahi introduced the following notation of the Cegrell classes. Let χ:( -   ∞  ,0]  →  ( -   ∞  ,0] be a continuous and nondecreasing function and let [formula] contain those plurisubharmonic functions u for which there exists a decreasing sequence uj∈, which converges pointwise to u on Ω, as j tends to +    ∞  , and

[formula]

Note that if χ =  - ( - t)p, then   =  , and if χ =  - 1, then   =  .

The measure [formula] might have infinite total mass, i.e. (ddcu)n(Ω) =  +   ∞  . On the other hand, if u∈(Ω), then under certain assumption on the function χ, the measure (ddcu)n vanishes on all pluripolar sets in Ω and the following integral is always finite

[formula]

which means that -  χ(u)(ddcu)n is a positive and finite measure on Ω. For this reason it is natural to consider the following Monge-Ampère type equation:

[formula]

where μ is a given positive and finite measure on Ω, which vanishes on pluripolar sets in Ω. We prove the following theorem.

Main Theorem. Assume that Ω is a bounded hyperconvex domain in [formula], n  ≥  1, and let χ:( -   ∞  ,0]  →  ( -   ∞  ,0] be a continuous increasing function such that χ(0) = 0 and lim t  →    -    ∞χ(t) =  -   ∞  , such that   ⊂  . If μ is a positive and finite measure in Ω, such that μ(P) = 0, for all pluripolar sets P  ⊂  Ω, then there exists a function u∈ such that

[formula]

Furthermore, if   ⊂  , then the solution of above equation is uniquely determined.

[formula] denotes the Cegrell class of all negative plurisubharmonic functions on which the complex Monge-Ampère operator (ddc  ·  )n is well defined and   ⊂   denotes the Cegrell class for which the smallest maximal plurisubharmonic majorant is identically equal to 0. It follows from [\cite=cegrell_energy], [\cite=cegrell_gdm], [\cite=cegrell_bdd] that ,  ⊆  .

It was proved in [\cite=b] that if χ:( -   ∞  ,0]  →  ( -   ∞  ,0] is a continuous increasing, convex or concave function such that χ(0) = 0 and lim t  →    -    ∞χ(t) =  -   ∞  , then   ⊂  .

It should be noted that uniqueness part is an immediate consequence of Cegrell's work in [\cite=cegrell_bdd] and the fact that [formula] is properly contained in [formula]. Let χ(t) =  - ( - t)p, (p > 0), in the Main Theorem, then it follows that: If μ is a positive and finite measure in Ω, such that μ(P) = 0, for all pluripolar sets P  ⊂  Ω, then there exists a unique function u∈ such that

[formula]

If χ:( -   ∞  ,0]  →  ( -   ∞  ,0] is a continuous function such that χ(0) < 0 and lim t  →    -    ∞χ(t) =  -   ∞  , then the existence of solution to the Monge-Ampère type equation given by

[formula]

is a consequence of [\cite=cegrell_kolodziej] with the assumption that -  χ(t)- 1 is bounded.

Proof of the Main Theorem

Let Ω be a bounded hyperconvex domain in [formula]. If a sequence uj∈ satisfies the condition

[formula]

and if there exists u∈PSH(Ω) such that uj  →  u weakly, then u∈.

From [\cite=cegrell_gdm] there exists [formula] such that [formula], j  →    ∞  . Note that since uj  →  u weakly, then u =  lim j  →    ∞vj, where

[formula]

Observe that vj is a decreasing sequence, vj  ≥  uj, so vj∈ and from [\cite=cegrell_gdm] we have

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Then φj∈, φj is a decreasing sequence [formula] and again from [\cite=cegrell_gdm] we get

[formula]

which means that u∈.

First we prove our Main Theorem in the case of compactly supported measures.

Let Ω be a bounded hyperconvex domain in [formula], and let χ:( -   ∞  ,0]  →  ( -   ∞  ,0] be a continuous increasing function such that χ(0) = 0 and lim t  →    -    ∞χ(t) =  -   ∞  . If μ is a positive, finite, and compactly supported measure in Ω, such that μ(P) = 0 for all pluripolar sets P  ⊂  Ω, then there exists a unique function [formula] such that

[formula]

If [formula], then it is clear that u = 0 is a solution of ([\ref=mat]). Assume now that [formula]. For [formula] consider the following equations

[formula]

The function defined by

[formula]

is bounded and continuous. Therefore it follows from [\cite=cegrell_kolodziej] that there exists uk∈, which satisfies ([\ref=ck]). We also have that

[formula]

so

[formula]

We shall next prove that there exist α∈,β∈ such that

[formula]

almost everywhere

[formula]

. Since u  ≠  0 then

[formula]

By Hartog's lemma, functions

[formula]

are uniformly bounded on   μ and therefore

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lep] yields that u∈.

The stability theorem proved in [\cite=cegrell_kolodziej] implies that the weak convergence, uk  →  u, is equivalent to convergence in capacity. Using Xing's theorem in [\cite=xing] we get that (ddcuk)n  →  (ddcu)n weakly. Therefore using the dominated convergence theorem we get that

[formula]

So we have proved that there exists a solution u∈ to ([\ref=mat]). Then we have that

[formula]

and therefore it follows from [\cite=bgz] that u∈.

It will be proved in the proof of the Main Theorem that if u,v∈ are solutions of ([\ref=mat]) then (ddcu)n = (ddcv)n and therefore u = v (see [\cite=cegrell_gdm]).

Assume that μ is a positive and finite measure in Ω such that μ(P) = 0 for all pluripolar sets P  ⊂  Ω. Let Ωj be a fundamental sequence of strictly pseudoconvex domains, i.e. [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=cegrell_bdd]). Let us define [formula], where [formula] is a characteristic function for Ωj. By Lemma [\ref=lemma] there exists a sequence [formula] such that

[formula]

We now shall prove that uj is a decreasing sequence. Let A = {z∈Ω:uj(z) < uj + 1(z)}. On the set A, we have that

[formula]

and by the comparison principle (see [\cite=bt2]) we get that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

on A. Similarly on the set [formula] we obtain that

[formula]

From the equalities ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]) we get that (ddcuj)n  ≥  (ddcuj + 1)n on Ωj. This implies that -  χ(uj)- 1dμj  ≥    -  χ(uj + 1)- 1dμj and then χ(uj)  ≥  χ(uj + 1) a.e.

[formula]

. Hence μj({uj < uj + 1}) = 0 and (ddcuj)n = 0 on [formula]. Since (ddcuj)n = dμj = 0 on [formula] we finally obtain that (ddcuj)n = 0 on A = {uj < uj + 1}.

Now take ψ∈ such that (ddcψ)n = dλ, where dλ is the Lebesgue measure, and consider [formula]. Observe that [formula] and Ak  ⊂  A. By the comparison principle (see [\cite=bt2]) we obtain that

[formula]

and then

[formula]

which means that λ(Ak) = 0. Hence λ(A) = 0, since [formula]. We have proved that uj  ≥  uj + 1 a.e
