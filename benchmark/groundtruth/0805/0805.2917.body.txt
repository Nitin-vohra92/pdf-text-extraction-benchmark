Introduction

Signal transmission through a noisy channel, such as digital media through the Internet, typically uses the following strategy: a generic signal is decomposed (encoded) into a sequence of coefficients which are then grouped into a number of packets of the same size. These packets are then sent through the noisy channel. For practical purposes, we shall assume that the noise in the channel cannot affect the integrity of the data in each packet; we can think that these small pieces of data are protected by an efficient error-correcting algorithm. Still, the noise of the channel may cause such a delay in the transmission or even the loss of some packets that the reconstruction of the signal is done possibly without the whole set of packets. At this point there are at least two different procedures to follow: we can attempt to reconstruct the signal by altering the decoding algorithm (taking into account the fact that there are some lost packets) or we can apply the decoding process to the received packets and accept that we obtain only an approximation of the original signal.

In the present paper we will adopt the second alternative for the reconstruction of the signal. Hence we search for encoding-decoding schemes that minimize, with respect to some measure, the worst case error between (a normalization of) the original signal and the reconstructed signal for a fixed number of packet losses, under certain hierarchies (see the beginning of Section [\ref=sec_4] for a description of these hierarchies). This and similar problems have been considered recently by Casazza and Kovacevic [\cite=Cas], Heath and Stromer [\cite=Stro], Holmes and Paulsen [\cite=HolPau], Bodmann and Paulsen [\cite=BodPau] and Bodmann [\cite=Bod] (and on the related work of Bodmann, Paulsen and Kribs [\cite=Pau]) where they describe the structure of optimal encoding-decoding schemes based on a particular choice to measure the worst case reconstruction error. Some of the results in the present paper can then be described as generalizations of some of the results obtained in those works, as we show that the previously mentioned optimal schemes are actually optimal with respect to a continuous family of measures (that includes most of the typical choices) of the worst case reconstruction error in the more general setting of block-(encoding-decoding) introduced in [\cite=Bod]. Our approach and techniques related with these problems are derived here as a generalization of those in [\cite=Bod].

The optimal schemes found in the frame-based transmission model (under suitable restrictions) are related with the so-called Parseval (or more generally tight) frames. These frames are also important for applications since they allow for representations of signals that are formally the same as those given by an orthonormal basis, but with the additional property of redundancy. There is a natural generalization of Parseval frames introduced by Bodmann in [\cite=Bod], the so-called protocols, which is the starting point for the development of the theory of optimal protocols under packet-erasures in that paper. In this setting, the optimal protocols correspond to some projective protocols, which were originally introduced by Casazza and Kutyniok [\cite=Caspalo] under the name of (Parseval) frames of subspaces, and recently have also been called fusion frames [\cite=Cas2]. But there are more general reconstruction systems (see Definition [\ref=defi_recons]) than protocols, just as there are more general frames than Parseval frames.

In order to investigate possible advantages of general protocols in the class of reconstruction systems we introduce what we called the q-potential, which is a generalization of the frame potential defined by Benedetto and Fickus in [\cite=BF] and further considered in [\cite=FJKO] and [\cite=casazza2]. In our case the q-potential of a reconstruction system takes values in the cone of positive matrices, rather than numerical values, a fact that makes it difficult to compare q-potentials of different systems. Still, we show that under suitable conditions, protocols are the minimizers of the q-potential within reconstruction systems with respect to (sub)majorization and thus we obtain lower bounds and minimizers of a family of (anti)entropic measures of the q-potential. These results indicate that protocols are indeed a good stating point for the theory of block-erasures.

Although there are interesting techniques to construct 2-uniform protocols i.e. protocols that are optimal for two packet losses (see [\cite=Bod], [\cite=BodPau], [\cite=HolPau]), the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of protocols that are optimal for one packet loss has been considered open (see the discussion in [\cite=Pau]). We relate this problem to a problem solved by Klyachko [\cite=Klya] and Fulton [\cite=Ful] related with Horn's conjecture on the sums of hermitian matrices and hence we obtain a characterization of the existence of such optimal protocols. This result can be regarded as an extension of the equivalence of the Schur-Horn problem on the main diagonal of an hermitian operator with prescribed spectrum and the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a frame for a finite dimensional Hilbert space with prescribed norms and frame operator as described in [\cite=JDM] (see also [\cite=casazza3] [\cite={Lar}] [\cite={Tropp}]), using the notion of extended majorization as described in [\cite=Mas]. We then derive derive the q-fundamental inequality (see Corollary [\ref=q_fund_ineq]), that is a generalization of the fundamental inequality found in [\cite=casazza2].

The paper is organized as follows. In section [\ref=spreliminares], after introducing some notation, we recall the notion of majorization and some of its properties. Then we distinguish a class of unitarily invariant norms (that we call compatible) that plays a key role here. We end the preliminaries by briefly describing the basic elements of Klyachko's theory on the sums of hermitian operators. We begin section [\ref=sec_3] by introducing the q-potential defined in the class of reconstruction systems and show that the protocols are the minimizers of this positive operator function with respect to submajorization. Thus, it is natural to restrict the analysis of optimal reconstruction systems for erasures to protocols. In subsection [\ref=subsec_4.1] we give a complete description of optimal protocols for one packet loss, when we base the measure of the worst case reconstruction error on a compatible unitarily invariant norm. In subsection [\ref=subsec_4.2] we deal with the case of two lost packets where we show explicitly a family of optimal protocols, when restricted to a certain family of optimal protocols for one loss packet. We then show that this restriction is automatically satisfied by optimal frames for one coefficient loss and obtain a generalization of previous results on the structure of optimal frames for two lost packets. Finally, in section [\ref=sec_5] we consider the problem of designing protocols with prescribed additional properties. In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal protocols for one packet loss, in terms of a finite set of linear inequalities.

Preliminaries

In this note we shall denote by [formula] and [formula], where [formula] stands for [formula] or [formula] and l  ≤  d. Hence, if l < d there is a natural injection ι:K  →  H such that ι(x) = (x,0d - l), where 0d - l denotes the zero vector in [formula]. Moreover, [formula] under the identification given by ι, with [formula]. Given [formula] we denote by [formula] the [formula]-algebra of all r  ×  t matrices with entries in [formula]. For simplicity we note [formula] instead of [formula]. We further consider [formula], [formula] and U(r) that are the real space of self-adjoint matrices, the cone of positive semi-definite matrices and the group of unitary matrices over [formula], respectively. If [formula] then we denote by [formula] the vector of eigenvalues of A (counting multiplicities) with its entries arranged in decreasing order. By fixing the canonical basis in H and K respectively, we shall identify L(H), L(K) and L(H,K) with [formula], [formula] and [formula] respectively. The vector [formula] is the vector with all its entries equal to 1. Finally, if X is a finite set then |X| denotes its cardinal.

Submajorization in [formula]

Given [formula] we denote by [formula] the vector obtained by re-arrangement of the coordinates of x in non-increasing order. Given [formula] we say that x is submajorized by y, and write [formula] if

[formula]

If we further have that [formula] then we say that x is majorized by y, and write [formula].

As an elementary example, that we shall use repeatedly, let [formula] and [formula]: then the reader can easily verify that

[formula]

The following result, that we shall need in the sequel, is an slight strengthening of the previous example.

Since [formula] then by Example [\ref=ejem], [formula]. Hence, if 1  ≤  k  ≤  l then [formula]. If [formula] then define [formula] and note that [formula]. Since [formula] then we conclude again that [formula]. If 1  ≤  k  ≤  l then [formula] and the lemma follows from this last fact.

(Sub)majorization between vectors is extended by T. Ando in [\cite=Ando] to (sub)majorization between self-adjoint matrices as follows : given [formula] then we say that A is submajorized by B, and write [formula], if [formula]. If we further have that [formula] then we say that A is majorized by B and write [formula].

Although simple, submajorization plays a central role in optimization problems with respect to convex functionals and unitarily invariant norms, as the following result shows (for a detailed account in majorization see Bhatia's book [\cite=Ba]).

Recall that given a unitarily invariant norm (henceforth abbreviated u.i.n.) [formula] in [formula] there exists an associated symmetric gauge function [formula] such that [formula], where [formula] is the vector of singular values of A. Next we describe a particular class of u.i.n's that we shall consider in the sequel.

Let V:H  →  K be a linear operator and assume that dimH = d > l = dimK. Then, it is well known that there exists a unitary operator U∈U(d) such that where the above block matrix representation is with respect to the decomposition [formula] as described in the preliminaries. Hence, if [formula] is a compatible u.i.n. in the sense of definition [\ref=defi_de_uin_comp] we have that [formula]. This last equality is our main motivation to consider these norms.

We shall use systematically the following facts, which are an elementary consequence of the previous results: if [formula] is an arbitrary u.i.n. in [formula] with associated symmetric gauge function ψ then for every [formula] (resp. [formula]) we have where [formula], since [formula] and [formula] respectively.

Klyachko's and Fulton's spectral theory on sums of hermitian matrices

In what follows we describe the basic facts about the spectral characterization of the sums of hermitian matrices obtained by Klyachko [\cite=Klya] and Fulton [\cite=Ful].

Let [formula]. For [formula], define the associated partition

[formula]

Denote by LR  dr(m) the set of (m + 1)-tuples [formula], such that the Littlewood-Richardson coefficient of the associated partitions [formula] is positive, i.e. one can generate the Young diagram of λ(J0) from those of [formula] λ(Jm) according to the Littlewood-Richardson rule (see [\cite=Ful0]). With these notations and terminologies we have We shall refer to the inequalities in [\eqref=comp_ec] as Klyachko's compatibility inequalities.

For comments on further developments related with the previous theorem see Remark [\ref=comentarios_LiPoon]

Optimality of [formula]-protocols for the q-potential

In what follows we consider (m,l,d)-reconstruction systems, which are more general system of operators than those considered in [\cite=BF], [\cite=Bod], [\cite=Pau], [\cite=BodPau], [\cite=HolPau] and [\cite=MR], that also have an associated reconstruction algorithm. In what follows H and K denote (real or complex) Hilbert spaces of dimensions d and l respectively, with l < d.

Notice that an (m,1,d)-reconstruction system is a frame [\cite=casart] in the usual sense.

Recall that an (m,l,d)-protocol on the Hilbert space H [\cite=Bod] is a family {Vi}mi = 1 such that Vi:H  →  K for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and [formula] (see also [\cite=Pau], where protocols are related to C*-encodings with noiseless subsystems). Clearly, (m,l,d)-protocols are (m,l,d)-reconstruction systems in the sense of definition [\ref=defi_recons].

If {Vi}mi = 1 is an (m,l,d)-reconstruction system then we consider its analysis operator [formula] given by [formula] ; similarly, we consider its synthesis operators given by V* i.e. [formula]. For a general (m,l,d)-reconstruction system {Vi}i such that [formula] we have and thus, we obtain the reconstruction formula In this context S = V*V is called the reconstruction system operator of {Vi}i while G = VV* is called the Grammian operator of for {Vi}i. It is easy to see that in this case {S- 1Vi} is also an (m,l,d)-reconstruction system, that we call the dual reconstruction system associated to {Vi}i. For practical purposes, an encoding-decoding scheme based on the (m,l,d)-reconstruction system above involves the problem of inverting the reconstruction system operator S. One of the advantages of considering (m,l,d)-protocols for applications is that the reconstruction system operator in this case is Id. As we shall see (m,l,d)-protocols are optimal in other senses, too.

In the seminal work [\cite=BF] Benedetto and Fickus introduced the so-called frame potential, as a potential function for the frame force. The structure of minimizers of the frame potential under several restrictions [\cite=BF], [\cite=FJKO], [\cite=casazza2] and [\cite=MR] have been obtained, since these are considered as stable configurations with respect to the frame force. This has motivated possible physical interpretations of families of frames, such as (uniform) tight frames [\cite=casazza2]. Moreover, in [\cite=MR] it is shown that the minimizers of the frame potential (under suitable restrictions) have structural properties implying their stability with respect to a more general family of convex functionals that contains the frame potential of Benedetto and Fickus.

In what follows we introduce the q-potential of a reconstruction system (regardless of an underlying force inducing this potential), which is a positive semi-definite matrix. Then, we consider two optimization problems associated with this potential (see Theorems [\ref=propopot] and [\ref=infi] below).

It is straightforward that the q-potential above is the value [formula] i.e. the partial trace of the square of the Grammian operator VV* with respect to the decomposition [formula]. Note that the q-potential coincides with the Benedetto-Fickus potential in the case l = 1. In contrast to the Benedetto-Fickus potential, there is no natural way a priori to compare the q-potential of two (m,l,d)-reconstruction systems when l > 1.

In order to state the following result we recall some distinguished classes of protocols. We say that an (m,l,d)-protocol {Vi}i is projective if for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  m then V*iVi = wi  Pi, where Pi is an orthogonal projection in [formula] and wi > 0 are called the associated weights. If the weights of a projective (m,l,d)-protocol are equal then we say that it is uniformly weighted (and we abbreviate this by u.w.p). Finally, we say that an (m,l,d)-protocol is rank-l, if rank(V*i) = l for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Notice that if {Vi}i is a rank-l projective (m,l,d)-protocol then ViV*i = wi  Il with wi > 0, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

Since [formula] then it follows that [formula] and thus [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Notice that [\eqref=desiuin] and [\eqref=ultimomomento] are consequences of this last fact (see the comments after Example [\ref=comments_before]).

Assume that majorization holds in [\eqref=hora_de_comer], so then we have

[formula]

Since [formula] and the function f(x) = x2 is strictly convex, by Theorem [\ref=props_submayo] we conclude that there exists a unitary U∈U(d) such that

[formula]

On the other hand, if there exists an u.i.n. [formula] such that equality holds in [\eqref=desiuin] then using the left-hand side of [\eqref=tempranillo] we get

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. As before, we conclude that V*V = Id. Finally, it is clear that in case {Vi}i is a projective rank-l (m,l,d)-protocol then [formula]. The last part of the theorem follows from this fact.

Let {Vi}i be an (m,l,d)-reconstruction system such that, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m and thus [formula]. Hence, [formula] and [\eqref=horas] and [\eqref=desiuin2] are consequences of Theorem [\ref=propopot]. If majorization holds in [\eqref=horas] or there exists u.i.n. [formula] such that equality holds in [\eqref=desiuin2] or there exists an increasing strictly convex function [formula] with f(0) = 0 such that equality holds in [\eqref=ultimomomento2] then again by Theorem [\ref=propopot], we conclude that {Vi} is an (m,l,d)-protocol. Thus, [formula] with [formula]. Therefore, [formula] and since [formula] (recall that f(x) = x2 is an strictly convex function) we conclude as before that [formula] for some rank-l orthogonal projection Pi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m.

There are other issues regarding this potential, such as the structure of local minimizers where we consider the relativization of the product topology in [formula], to the sets of reconstruction systems considered in the previous theorems. We shall consider these and related problems elsewhere.

Optimal protocols for erasures and strict compatible u.i.n.

Following [\cite=Bod](see also [\cite=BodPau], [\cite=HolPau]) we begin by modeling the situation in which in an encoding-decoding scheme based on an (m,l,d)-protocol some fixed number of packets (Vix) are lost, corrupted or just delayed for such a long time the we decide to reconstruct x without these packets.

In order to model the previous situation we consider a signal as a vector in the d-dimensional (real or complex) vector space H, which is transmitted in the form of m packets of l linear coefficients. Hence, each packet is a vector the l-dimensional (real or complex) Hilbert space K. We shall assume that d < ml to allow for redundancy of the information sent through the channel and thus for the possibility of a reasonable reconstruction even when some packets are lost in the transmission. On the other hand, we shall also assume that l < d i.e. the dimension (complexity) of the data is strictly bigger that the dimension of the noiseless sub-channel (sub-system) which constitute the packets (otherwise there are trivial optimal schemes).

Given [formula] a subset of size [formula] we consider the associated packet-lost operator [formula] on [formula] given by [formula], where [formula] denotes the characteristic function of the set [formula]. We denote [formula]. In order to simplify the notation we write Ej (respectively Dj) in case [formula].

In our present situation, we shall consider a "blind reconstruction" strategy for (m,l,d)-protocols for H. In case some packets are lost, i.e. assuming that the encoded information [formula] (for some x∈H) is altered according to the packet-lost operator [formula], our reconstructed vector will be [formula], where V denotes the analysis operator of the (m,l,d)-protocol {Vi}mi = 1.

As a measure of performance of an (m,l,d)-protocol in this setting we introduce the worst-case reconstruction error when p packets are lost with respect to an arbitrary compatible unitarily invariant norm:where [formula] is a compatible u.i.n. with associated symmetric gauge function ψ (see Definition [\ref=defi_de_uin_comp]) and V denotes the analysis operator of the (m,l,d)-protocol {Vi}mi = 1. Since the set V(m,l,d) of all (m,l,d)-protocols is compact then the value is attained and we define the set of 1-loss optimal protocols for [formula] to be the nonempty compact set Vψ1(m,l,d) where this infimum is attained, i.e. Proceeding inductively, we now set for 1  ≤  p  ≤  m and define the optimal p-protocols for [formula] to be the non-empty compact subset of Vψp - 1(m,l,d) where this infimum is attained.

[formula] optimality for one package lost

Following [\cite=Bod] we consider

[formula]

Recall that in this case [formula] and hence

[formula]

Using the fact that [formula], [\eqref=desienun1] now follows from [\eqref=desi1] and [\eqref=desi2].

Assume further that [formula] is strict and the equality holds in [\eqref=desienun1]. Then, equality also hold in [\eqref=desi1] and [\eqref=desi2], too. Since [formula] is strict we conclude that [formula] and hence V*jVj is a multiple (independent of j) of a rank-l projection. The lemma easily follows from these facts.

For fixed 1  ≤  j  ≤  m note that V*V - V*EjV = V*Dj  V and

[formula]

Therefore, the quantity to be minimized is [formula]. The result now follows from the previous lemma.

The previous theorem completely characterizes the structure of the 1-loss optimal (m,l,d)-protocols in case [formula] is an strict compatible u.i.n. Since the operator norm is a compatible strict u.i.n. we derive in particular [\cite=Bod] (note that for the operator norm [formula] we have [formula]). In section [\ref=sec_5] we shall be concerned with the existence of protocols with prescribed properties (such as u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols).

The case of two lost packages

Consider the quantity defined in [\cite=Bod]

[formula]

In what follows we consider the class

In order to compute the worst case reconstruction error for two lost packages we note that if [formula] is a compatible u.i.n. then (see the comments after Definition [\ref=defi_de_uin_comp] in the Preliminaries)

[formula]

where the last equality above follows from [\cite=HoJo] and [formula] is the vector of singular values of [formula]. Notice that for i  ≠  j

[formula]

and since {Vi}i∈C(m,l,d) then for some fixed i0  ≠  j0 we should have

[formula]

Now, [\eqref=igualtr], [\eqref=cotatr] and Lemma [\ref=lemmayo] imply that in this case Therefore, Finally, is clear that in case that {Vi}i is such that for i  ≠  j, ViV*j = c  m,  l,d  Qi,j for unitary operators on K, then {Vi}i∈C(m,l,d) and it attains the bound of eψ2 in [\eqref=ecteo22].

It would be interesting to characterize the structure of all u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols that attain the lower bound in [\eqref=ecteo22] in the general context of compatible u.i.n. On the other hand, it is not clear at this point whether the condition in the definition of the class C(m,l,d) is not trivial, i.e. it holds for every u.w.p. protocol (see also Lemma [\ref=truch] and Corollary [\ref=coroa]).

The following facts are known for l = 1 (see [\cite=HolPau]).

Since VV* = (VV*)2 then for fixed 1  ≤  i  ≤  m

[formula]

Now [\eqref=iguanorcuad] follows by taking traces in [\eqref=yoto]. Using again [\eqref=yoto] and the concavity of the square root function [\cite=Rot] we get which is [\eqref=desicota]. Now, from [\eqref=iguanorcuad] we get [\eqref=ecanexa]. Using [\eqref=ecanexa] we get that, for fixed 1  ≤  i  ≤  m

[formula]

Finally, from [\eqref=desicota] and using [\eqref=uf] we get [\eqref=otro_truch].

Given a compatible strict u.i.n. [formula] we say that it is k-strongly strict if for every [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] then A = U*BU for some U∈U(k). For example, the p-norms are k-strongly strict for k  ≥  1 (see Example [\ref=comments_before]). On the other hand, it is easy to see that the operator norm is 2-strongly strict.

By setting respectively l = 1, respectively m = 2, in [\eqref=otro_truch] we see that in these cases C(m,l,d) coincides with the class of all u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols (i.e. the condition in the definition of C(m,l,d) becomes trivial in these cases) so the first part of item (i) and item (ii) follow from Theorem [\ref=elteo].

In order to prove the second assertion in item (i) assume that [formula] is a 2-strongly strict compatible u.i.n. Note that if [formula] are such that [formula] then these vectors are comparable with respect to majorization; indeed [formula] if and only if max {α1,α2}  ≤   max {β1,β2}. Assume now that [formula] is a 2-strongly strict norm and that {Vi}i is an u.w.p. (m,1,d)-protocol in which the lower bound in [\eqref=operadora] is attained. Hence, by inspection of the proof of Theorem [\ref=elteo] (note that [formula] for l = 1) we see that if i  ≠  j then

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we conclude that equality holds in the right hand side of [\eqref=implicado] and the theorem follows from this last fact.

Existence of optimal protocols for one package lost and the q-fundamental inequality

In [\cite=Bod], [\cite=BodPau], [\cite=HolPau], [\cite=Pau] and [\cite=Tropp], several examples of 2-loss optimal protocols, i.e u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols {Vi} for which ViV*j = cm,l,d  Qij with Qij∈U(l), are constructed based on different techniques. Still, the problem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of 1-loss optimal protocols, i.e. u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols, has been considered open (see the discussion in [\cite=Pau] about this topic).

In the case l = 1 (i.e. the classical case of frames), the existence of tight normalized frames with given norms of the frame vectors (and hence of 1-loss optimal protocols) is characterized completely by the so-called fundamental frame inequality discovered in [\cite=casazza2]. Moreover it is now known ([\cite=JDM], [\cite=casazza3], [\cite=Lar], [\cite=MR]) that the fundamental frame inequality is a particular case of a majorization relation (via the Schur-Horn theorem) that constitutes a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a frame with prescribed norms of the frame vectors and frame operator.

In what follows we exhibit necessary and sufficient (spectral) conditions for the existence of (m,l,d)-protocols {Vi}i with prescribed eigenvalue vectors [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. As in the classical case l = 1 there exists a relation between these conditions and an extended notion of (block) majorization as introduced in [\cite=Mas].

Clearly, ([\ref=item_1]) implies ([\ref=item_2]) by considering Ai = V*iVi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Assume then item ([\ref=item_2]). In this case note that rank(Ai)  ≤  l and hence there exist linear operators Vi:H  →  K such that V*iVi = Ai for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. It is clear that {Vi}mi = 1 is an (m,l,d)-protocol as in ([\ref=item_1]). Therefore, ([\ref=item_1]) and ([\ref=item_2]) are equivalent.

The equivalence of items ([\ref=item_2]) and ([\ref=item_3]) is Theorem [\ref=teoK].

Assume again ([\ref=item_1]) holds and let [formula] be the analysis operator of the protocol {Vi}i. Since [formula] then we get that the block matrix [formula] (i.e. the Grammian of {Vi}i) is an orthogonal projection; moreover, note that [formula] and that the diagonal blocks of the Grammian satisfy (λ(ViV*i),0d - l) = λ(V*iVi) = (λi,0d - l), for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m (see the comments after Definition [\ref=defi_de_uin_comp]). Conversely, assume that item ([\ref=item_4]) holds and let [formula] be an isometry such that VV* = P (such an isometry exists since rank(P) = d by assumption). Let Vi:H  →  K for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m be such that [formula] and note that then P = VV* = (ViV*j)ij and that [formula] that is, {Vi}i is an (m,l,d)-protocol as in ([\ref=item_1]). Thus, items ([\ref=item_1]) and ([\ref=item_4]) are equivalent.

As an immediate consequence of the q-f.p.p.i. we conclude that u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols exist if and only if for every 1  ≤  r  ≤  d and every [formula] it holds that

[formula]

Next, we show explicitly how to construct a projection [formula] such that [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m, when d = k  ·  l for some [formula]. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=con_suf_y_nec], we show the existence of u.w.p. rank-l (m,l,d)-protocols in this case. This construction is a particular case of that appearing in the proof of [\cite=Mas]: consider first [formula] an m-th primitive root of unity and let [formula] be the matrix with j-th row given by

[formula]

It is then straightforward to show that the rows of Ũ form an orthonormal basis for [formula] and hence Ũ∈U(m) is a unitary matrix. Let U∈U(d  ·  m) be the block matrix U = (Ũij  ·  1d)mi,j = 1. Then, consider the matrix [formula] and note that

[formula]

where the last equality follows from the diagonal block structure of A and by construction of U. Now, recall that [formula] and we are done.
