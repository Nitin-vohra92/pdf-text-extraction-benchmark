1. Introduction

Consider the binary decomposition of a positive integer n:

[formula]

where εk = 0,1 and [formula]

We split the set of positive integers into two nonintersecting classes as follows:

[formula]

In 1968, A.O. Gel'fond [\cite=G] obtained the following theorem: for the number of integers n, n  ≤  X, satisfying the conditions [formula], [formula] (j = 0,1), the following asymptotic formula is valid:

[formula]

where m, l are any naturals and [formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

The proof of formula ([\ref=AOG]) is based on the estimate

[formula]

of the trigonometrical sum

[formula]

which is valid for any real values of α.

In 1996, author [\cite=E1] proved the following theorem: Let Fi,k be the number of solutions of the equation n - m = 1, where n  ≤  X, [formula], [formula], i,k = 0,1. Then the asymptotic formulas hold:

[formula]

[formula]

It follows from this theorem that the orders of Fi,k(X) strongly depend on the values of i and k.

In present paper we consider two problems in which the indicated effect vanishes.

Our main results are the following theorems.

Let h be any integer such that 0  ≤  h  ≤  2. Let Ii,k(X,h) be the number of solutions of the equation n - 3m = h, where m  ≤  X, [formula], [formula], i,k = 0,1. Then the asymptotic formulas hold:

[formula]

Let l be any integer such that 0  ≤  h  ≤  4. Let Ji,k(X,l) be the number of solutions of the equation n - 5m = l, where m  ≤  X, [formula], [formula], i,k = 0,1. Then the asymptotic formulas hold:

[formula]

Let us introduce two sums:

[formula]

where h and l are nonnegative integers.

Proofs of the theorems 1 and 2 are based on lemmas 1 and 2 consequently (see below), and also on Gel'fond's estimate ([\ref=AOG1]).

2. Lemmas

Suppose that h is an integer such that 0  ≤  h  ≤  2. The following estimate holds:

[formula]

Grouping summands over even and over odd n and using obvious formulae ε(2n) = ε(n), ε(2n + 1) =  - ε(n) we have the following equalities

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Consider the linear combination

[formula]

where α0, β0, γ0 are constants. By ([\ref=f1])-([\ref=f3]) we have

[formula]

[formula]

where

Repeating this reasoning we arrive to the equality

[formula]

[formula]

where j is any integer such that 0  ≤  j  ≤   log 2X - 10, Xj = X2- j, and the sequences αj, βj, γj satisfy to the system of recurrent equations

[formula]

Let us write ([\ref=f4]) in matrix form

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

One can easily see that A = CBC- 1, where

[formula]

here 1, [formula], [formula] are eigenvalues of A.

Thus we have

[formula]

Note that [formula]. It follows from ([\ref=f5]) that if [formula], or [formula], or [formula] then

[formula]

Let J be the largest natural number such that J  ≤   log 2X - 10, [formula].

It follows from ([\ref=f6]) that

The estimates [formula], [formula] we obtain in a similar way.

Suppose that l is an integer such that 0  ≤  l  ≤  4. The following estimate holds:

[formula]

where [formula]

Consider the linear combination

[formula]

where α0, β0, γ0, σ0 and τ0 are constants.

Repeating the reasoning of the proof of lemma 1 we arrive to the equality

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where J is the largest natural number such that J  ≤   log 2X - 10, XJ = X2- J and vector [formula] is defined with equation

[formula]

Let us write out the eigenvalues of the matrix A1:

[formula]

[formula]

Note that eigenvalues λ2, λ3, λ4 are simple and λ1 has multiplicity 2.

It is a well known fact of Linea Algebra that there exists a nonsingular matrix C1 such that A1 = C1B1C- 11, where

[formula]

Thus we have the equality

[formula]

Since [formula] it follows from ([\ref=f9]) that the inequalities

[formula]

hold and so for any l, 0  ≤  l  ≤  4 we have the estimate

[formula]

where [formula]

3. Proofs of Theorems 1 and 2

Let us prove theorem 1. For any integer h, 0  ≤  h  ≤  2, and for any i,j = 0,1 we have

Now theorem 1 follows immediately from obvious inequality [formula], Gel'fond's estimate ([\ref=AOG1]) and lemma 1.

Proof of theorem 2 essentially coincides with proof of theorem 1. The only distinction is use lemma 2 instead of lemma 1.
