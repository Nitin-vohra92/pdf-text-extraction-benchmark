A uniformly spread measure criterion

Let [formula] be a discrete sequence in [formula], i.e., a map [formula] such that its image [formula] has no limit point in [formula] and each [formula] has at most a finite multiplicity. Following Laczkovich [\cite=L1], [\cite=L2], we say that the sequence is uniformly spread over [formula], if there is α > 0 such that

[formula]

where the infimum is taken over all bijections [formula].

Using the idea of the mass transfer (see, for example, [\cite=KA]), M. Sodin, B. Tsirelson extended the above definition to measures in [formula]. In [\cite=ST] they introduce a transportation distance between arbitrary locally finite positive measures ν1 and ν2

[formula]

Here the infimum is taken over all transportation measures γ between measures ν1 and ν2, where the latter means

[formula]

[formula]

for all continuous functions [formula] with a compact support.

The degree of concentration of γ near diagonal of [formula] shows the closeness of ν1 and ν2 to each other.

A continuous analogue of definition of uniformly spreading ([\ref=d0]) (actually belonging to M. Sodin, B. Tsirelson [\cite=ST]) has the form

A locally finite positive measure ν on [formula] is uniformly spread over [formula], if there is β > 0 such that

[formula]

where ω is the Lebesgue measure on [formula].

In what follows we denote by νx the shift of the measure ν along [formula], and for any [formula] put

[formula]

Also, we denote by [formula], the indicator of the cube Q(m,  1).

For a discrete sequence [formula] we set

[formula]

where δ is a unit mass sitting in the origin. Then

[formula]

As above, the infimum is taken over all bijections [formula], and the constants C1 and C2 depend only on the dimension d.

In fact, if the sequence satisfies ([\ref=d0]), then the measure [formula] is a transportation measure between ν and α- dω, and the first inequality in ([\ref=i2]) follows easily. The second inequality in ([\ref=i2]) is nontrivial. Its proof in [\cite=L2] is based on the Rado Lemma from the graph theory.

The main result of our article is the following theorem. Proof of the Theorem [\ref=0]. By [\cite=ST], we have

[formula]

Hence, ([\ref=d1]) and the equality [formula] imply ([\ref=c]).

Next, suppose that the measure ν satisfies ([\ref=c]). We decompose [formula] into the cubes [formula]. Let γm be a transportation measure between ν and νm. For fixed [formula] set

[formula]

It follows from definition of a transportation measure ([\ref=t1]) and ([\ref=t2]) that λk,n is a transportation measure between ν and

[formula]

Note that we can replace in ([\ref=t1]) and ([\ref=t2]) the function φ by the indicator function of any bounded Borel subset of [formula]. Therefore, by ([\ref=c]), we get for any [formula]

[formula]

Hence the measures μk,n are uniformly bounded on every compact subset of [formula], and the measures λk,n are uniformly bounded on every compact subset of [formula]. By ([\ref=c]),

[formula]

Take a subsequence n'  →    ∞   such that for each [formula] the measures λk,n weakly converge to some measure λk, and the measures μk,n weakly converge to some measure μk. Note that for any [formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

as n  →    ∞  . Hence, for each [formula] the variations of measures μk,n  -  μk',n on every compact subset tend to zero as n  →    ∞   . The same assertion is valid for the differences λk,n  -  λk',n. Therefore, for all [formula] we have [formula] and [formula] for some measures λ and μ. Moreover,

[formula]

It can easily be checked that the measure λ is a transportation measure between ν and μ. By ([\ref=t]), we get

[formula]

Hence, [formula]. Let ρm be the restriction of the measure μ to Q(m,1). We obtain that the measure

[formula]

is a transportation measure between μ and βω with β  =  μ(Q(0,1)). Finally,

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=0] is proved.

For discrete sequences in [formula] we obtain the following result.

Proof. Clearly, ([\ref=d0]) yields ([\ref=s]). On the other hand, if ([\ref=s]) holds and ν is the measure defined in ([\ref=a]), then the measure

[formula]

is a transportation measure between νz and ν. Condition ([\ref=s]) implies Tra(νz,ν) <   ∞  . By Theorem [\ref=0], for some α > 0 we have Tra(ν,α- dω) <   ∞  . Using ([\ref=i2]), we obtain ([\ref=d0]).
