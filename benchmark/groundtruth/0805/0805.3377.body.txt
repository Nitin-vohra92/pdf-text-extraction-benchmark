Suzaku Observations of Tycho's Supernova Remnant

Introduction

Extensive studies at X-ray and TeV energies have been carried out in recent years to reveal the origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). Diffusive shock acceleration at the blast waves of supernova remnants (SNRs) is widely believed to be a prime source for producing CRs up to energies of the so-called "knee" in the CR spectrum around 1000 TeV. The ASCA observation of SN 1006 [\citep=koyama1995] revealed a featureless power-law component, interpreted as originating from synchrotron emission near the outer shell and appearing well separated from a thermal component filling the projected interior. Such a clear situation is, however, not usually the case with the other youngest SNRs, in which any nonthermal synchrotron X-ray emission from the blast wave is difficult to separate from the relatively more dominant thermal X-ray components. To more readily achieve this separation, we focus on the higher energy X-ray band where the thermal contribution is low.

One of the brightest remnants among the Galactic historical supernovae is Tycho's SNR (observed by Tycho Brahe in AD 1572). Synchrotron emission, like that from SN 1006, has been expected from this remnant based on shock acceleration models (see, for example, [\cite=ammosov1994]), at high enough X-ray brightness levels to offer the possibility of observationally separating the nonthermal from thermal emission. The first evidence for hard X-ray emission in Tycho's SNR was provided by the A-2 experiment on HEAO 1 [\citep=pravdo1979] which measured the integrated spectrum of the entire remnant up to 25 keV. Using the 4.5-20 keV Ginga spectrum of the SNR, [\citet=fink1994] detected a power-law component with photon index αp = 2.72, in combination with a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and an Fe Kα emission line. The RXTE satellite detected the hard continuum spectrum up to 20 keV and measured a photon index αp  ~  3 [\citep=petre1999].

Recent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of Tycho's SNR have provided spatially resolved spectra up to photon energies around 10 keV. One remarkable feature of the high angular resolution data was the discovery of spectrally-featureless, geometrically-thin filaments encircling nearly the entire outer rim of the SNR [\citep=hwang2002]. Although the featureless nature of the spectra from the outer rim can be accommodated by the either power-law or thermal bremsstrahlung models, various lines of evidence favor a nontherml synchrotron origin for the emission [\citep=warren2005]. Detailed models for the X-ray spectra and morphology of these filaments [\citep=cassam2007] strongly indicate that the outer rim X-ray emission of this SNR comes via synchrotron radiation from electrons shock-accelerated up to energies of a few 10 TeV. Similar features have now been seen in other young remnants of historical supernovae [\citep=bamba2005].

Tycho's SNR also shows intense atomic emission lines which were studied in detail with Tenma by [\citet=tsunemi1986], who showed for the first time that the Kα line energies of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe were significantly lower than those expected under ionization equilibrium conditions, requiring that the X-ray emitting plasma be in a strongly under-ionized and therefore nonequilibrium condition. Investigations of Tycho's thermal emission, especially its spatial variation, were also carried out by ASCA [\citep=hwang1997], Chandra [\citep=hwang2002], and XMM-Newton [\citep=decourchelle2001]. The most recent detailed results on the ejecta properties of the Tycho's SNR come from [\citet=badenes2006], who compared the integrated X-ray spectrum to theoretical models for the ejecta X-ray emission of thermonuclear (i.e., Type Ia) supernovae.

In the present paper, we study the recent broad-band X-ray observation of Tycho's SNR by the Suzaku satellite. Utilizing the long exposure duration and the excellent CCD spectral resolution we conduct a sensitive search for faint emission lines. We also use the broad spectral coverage of Suzaku (the remnant is detected from photon energies of 0.5 keV up to a few tens of keV) to separate the nonthermal component from the dominant thermal X-ray component.

Observations and Data Reduction

Observations

Launched on 2005 July 10 as a joint Japan-US mission [\citep=mitsuda2007], Suzaku carries four X-ray telescopes (XRT; [\cite=serlemitsos2007]) each of which illuminates an X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS; [\cite=koyama2007]) with ×   field of view. The payload includes a co-aligned non-imaging hard X-ray detector (HXD; [\cite=takahashi2007]) as well. While the entire HXD and the high energy portion of the XIS spectra play a major role in studying the nonthermal emission, the lower energy part of the XIS data a also useful for accurately constraining the thermal component.

Tycho's SNR was observed by Suzaku on 2006 June 26 through June 29 as part of the mission's Science Working Group program. The observation was carried out with the remnant's center placed at the center of the XIS CCD chip; the pointing coordinates were (α, δ)=(, ) (equinox J2000.0). A nearby sky region, at coordinates (α, δ)=(, ), offset from the SNR along the Galactic plane, was observed on 2006 June 29 in order to acquire background data. There are no known bright X-ray sources in the HXD field-of-view at the offset observation.

During these observations, 16 out of 64 silicon PIN diodes of the HXD were operated at a lower bias voltage (400 V) to avoid unexpected breakdown of the sensors. The other PIN diodes were operated at the nominal bias voltage of 500 V. The four XIS sensors, three front illuminated CCD chips (XIS 0, XIS 2 and XIS 3) and a back illuminated one (XIS 1), were operated in the standard mode.

HXD-PIN Data Reduction

In the analysis, we excluded the data from the 16 PIN diodes operated at the lower bias voltage, because it is difficult at the present time to estimate their energy response and background accurately enough. We used cleaned events from the revision 1.2 data processing of the HXD data reduction software. Data were excluded if acquired during potential high background parts of the orbit (where the cutoff rigidity less than 8 GeV/c or for 500 s after passage through the South Atlantic Anomaly), or when the target elevation was less than 5[formula] above the horizon. The data selection was done using the XSELECT package of HEASOFT version 6.2. The net exposure after data selection was 92.0 ks and 45.8 ks for the Tycho and offset observations, respectively.

Although a generic non-X-ray background model is provided by the detector team, we used the offset observation data to estimate the total instrument and sky background of HXD-PIN. This is because we expect to achieve higher accuracy for the HXD-PIN background subtraction when using the offset observation, which was carried out for a relatively long time just after the on-source observation, under nearly the same conditions for the non-X-ray background. We superposed orbital phases of the on-source and offset observations, and extracted the events from exactly the same orbital phase regions. The net on-source and off-source exposures used for making spectra are 74.5 ks and 37.3 ks, respectively.

Figure [\ref=fig:onset_offset] shows the on-source, offset and background subtracted HXD-PIN spectra from 10 through 50 keV. We estimated the systematic error in the background spectra from Earth occultation data, which gives a measure of the non-X-ray background. We selected data with elevation from the Earth rim [formula] for both the on-source and offset observations, retaining identical values for the other selection criteria. We compared the occultation events between the two observations, and found that they agree with each other to within 5% accuracy. In the following we adopt a value of 5% for the systematic error in the spectrum. To evaluate the background-subtraction accuracy in greater detail, we made a background subtracted 12-30 keV light curve and fitted it with a constant. The fit yielded a mean count rate and the associated 90% confidence-level error of (5.66±  0.31)×  10- 2 cts s- 1, with χ2/dof=1691/1547. The light curve is thus consistent with a constant source (as expected for the SNR) thereby validating the background subtraction technique. In figure [\ref=fig:onset_offset], the level of background systematic error (calculated as 5% of the offset spectrum) is shown. We have thus securely detected the hard X-ray emission from Tycho's SNR up to 30 keV. The lowest end of the PIN spectrum extends to ~  12 keV, as determined by thermal noise in the diodes [\citep=kokubun2007].

For an extended source like Tycho's SNR, an additional correction factor must be applied to the HXD-PIN effective area when trying to estimate the source flux. The remnant is about in diameter, and the XIS pointed right at the center of the remnant ("XIS nominal position"). Although this correction factor should be included in the ancially response files (ARFs) based on the specific morphology of the source, the current software tool hxdarfgen can calculate the response only for point sources. Therefore, to mimic a ring-like morphology (i.e., a rim-brightened structure as expected for Tycho's SNR), we assumed 8 point sources placed uniformly around a circle of radius centered on the pointing direction. Then, we calculated an ARF for each of them, taking into account the offset between the XIS and HXD optical axes. The final ARF was obtained by just averaging the eight ARFs. To evaluate systematic errors associated with this ARF, we also generated a disk-like ARF with the same radius. The difference between the annular and disk-like ARFs was confirmed to be less than 1% in the 12-30 keV band.

XIS Data Reduction

For the XIS data reduction, we used cleaned events (revision 1.2) of the three front-illuminated CCDs (XIS 0, XIS 2 and XIS 3). The left panel of figure [\ref=fig:xis0_image] shows the XIS image at energies between 7 and 12 keV. The region we employed to extract the on-source spectrum is shown in the figure. The right panel of figure [\ref=fig:xis0_image] shows the image of the offset observation, where an ellipse on the image indicates the region from which we extracted the background spectrum. Note that this region excluded an unknown diffuse, faint object visible in the XIS image of the offset observation. To evaluate the XIS background systematic error, we made another background file from the Lockman Hole observation (80 ks exposure). The difference between the offset and Lockman Hole background spectra is 1% in the integrated 5-12 keV count rate and the spectral shape is identical within statistical errors, we have decided to use the offset background in the analysis.

ARF files describing the XIS effective area, combined with the X-ray mirror response, were generated by xissimarfgen [\citep=ishisaki2007]. To make the XIS ARF consistent with that of PIN, we generated the XIS ARFs assuming an annular source with a radius of . Since we interested mainly in the hard X-ray emission, this assumption is justified by the XIS image above 7 keV which reveals a clear ring-line source morphology.

Analysis and Results

Characterization of HXD-PIN spectrum

Figure [\ref=fig:pin_spec] shows the background subtracted PIN spectrum of Tycho's SNR in the 12-30 keV band. We fitted the data successfully with a power-law model, and obtained a photon index of αp = 2.83+ 0.56- 0.53(stat)+ 0.56- 0.03(syst) with χ2/dof=25.5/21. The statistical error is shown at a confidence level of 90%, while the systematic error refers to the 5% uncertainty in estimating the background using the offset data. The residuals from the fit are also given in figure [\ref=fig:pin_spec]. If we assume the source of the emission to have an annular shape with a radius of , the 12-30 keV model flux is (1.90+ 0.13- 1.28  + 0.48- 0.30)×  10- 11 ergs cm- 2 s- 1. Alternatively, we fitted the PIN data with a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum, and obtained a temperature of kT = 12.4+ 8.2- 3.9  + 0.9- 2.1 keV with χ2/dof=27.1/21. The 12-30 keV model flux is (1.88+ 0.13- 0.89  + 0.52- 0.62)×  10- 11 ergs cm- 2 s- 1. Thus, the two fits are both acceptable, although the power-law model is statistically somewhat favored.

Emission lines above 4 keV

The atomic emission lines below 4 keV have been well studied by previous missions, including ASCA [\citep=hwang1997], Chandra, and XMM-Newton [\citep=decourchelle2001] [\citep=badenes2006]. Here we focus on the spectra above 4 keV, where Suzaku has a larger effective area and a lower background level than other missions. Figure [\ref=fig:lines]a shows the XIS spectrum in the 4.1-8.5 keV energy range, where we observe an intense Fe Kα emission line. We fitted the spectrum with a composite model consisting of a power-law and several Gaussians. The best fit parameters were αp = 2.7 and the Fe Kα line center energy was 6.445 keV. The measured line center energy is in an approximate agreement with that obtained with Tenma, 6.40  ±  0.03 keV [\citep=tsunemi1986]. This fit was not statistically acceptable (χ2/dof=447.6/180), and there were clear residuals around 4.5, 5.5, 5.9 and 7.1 keV. The fit was significantly improved (χ2/dof=209.1/170) by the addition of four more Gaussian lines. The best fit model is also shown in figure [\ref=fig:lines]a, and the residuals are shown in figure [\ref=fig:lines]b. Figure [\ref=fig:lines]d shows a magnified view of the spectrum around the faint lines. The best fit parameters of the four Gaussians, including the central energy, flux and equivalent width, are summarized in the Table [\ref=table:lines]. The background spectrum subtracted from the source spectrum is shown in figure [\ref=fig:lines]c. The weak line at ~  5.90 keV is leakage from the on-board 55Fe calibration source and only appears in sensor XIS 0. The line at ~  7.47 keV is nickel fluorescence from the nearby structure of the XIS camera.

The lines at 4.56, 5.48, 5.95, and 7.11 keV have not been reported previously. Given the significant flux from He-like Ca Kα [\citep=badenes2006], the simplest explanation for the 4.56 keV line is He-like Ca Kβ. (Furthermore, the expected He-like Ca Kβ energy centroid of 4.58 keV is consistent with our line measurements.) The next two lines, 5.48 and 5.95 keV, are probably Kα lines from elements near Fe on the periodic table. They exhibit slightly higher energies than the Kα lines of neutral Cr and Mn, which are centered at 5.41, and 5.90 keV, respectively. To evaluate their nature, we plotted their energy Ei as a function of atomic number, Zi, and fitted to Moseley's law [\citep=moseley1913];

[formula]

It is known that the normalization factor is [formula] keV with Rydberg energy (Ry) and the screening factor is [formula] for Kα lines of neutral atoms. Figure [\ref=fig:moseley2] shows the line energies determined in this analysis and Kα lines from neutral atoms of Z=24-26, together with results obtained by fitting equation ([\ref=eq:moseley]). In the fits, we fixed a to that of neutral species, and allowed b to vary. The best fit value obtained was [formula], and the new Kα lines fell on Moseley's law within uncertainties. We thus conclude that the lines are from similarly ionized states of Cr, Mn, and Fe. We note that there is a weak contamination line at 5.90 keV (figure [\ref=fig:lines]c) but this appears only in XIS 0, while the 5.95 keV line was detected in all XIS instruments.

If we extrapolate our best fit to Moseley's law, we estimate the centroid energy of the Co (Z = 27) and Ni (Z = 28) Kα lines to be 6.97 and 7.51 keV. Neither value matches the line centroid of the 7.11 keV feature, from which we conclude that the line at 7.11 keV is probably the Fe Kβ blend. The low central energies of both the Fe Kα and Fe Kβ line blends indicate that the emitting iron is in an extremely low ionization condition. The central energies of Kα and Kβ are consistent with those of Fe XV or XVI as calculated by [\citet=mendoza2004]. Assuming these ionization states, the Fe Kβ to Kα flux ratio, f(Kβ)/f(Kα)=0.04±  0.01, is consistent with [\citet=mendoza2004] who calculated this flux ratio for K-vacancy configurations of iron atoms.

Although there was no significant excess emission at energies corresponding to the Ni Kα in the XIS spectrum (figure [\ref=fig:lines]a), we estimated the upper limit of the Ni Kα flux by adding a Gaussian with its centroid energy fixed at 7.51 keV. The fits yielded a 90%-confidence upper limit flux and equivalent width of [formula] ph cm- 2 s- 1 and 25.1 eV, respectively.

PIN and XIS joint fitting with conventional models

To characterize the continuum spectrum of Tycho's SNR, we fitted the XIS spectra above 5 keV simultaneously with the 12-30 keV PIN spectrum. Since the lines from Cr and Mn introduced above are not taken into account in current nonequilibulium ionization models, we fitted the data with conventional (power-law or thermal bremsstrahlung) models plus four Gaussians. In the fitting, the low energy absorption was fixed to [formula] cm- 2 as obtained by [\citet=cassam2007], while the other parameters were left free. As calibrated by [\citet=kokubun2007] using the Crab Nebula, the model normalization to fit the PIN data was set 13% higher than that of the XIS data.

First, we fitted the spectra with a thermal bremsstrahlung model plus Gaussians. Figure [\ref=fig:xis_pin_fit]a shows the fit result and residuals. The best-fit parameter value was kT = 5.14+ 0.14- 0.12 keV. The fit yielded a relatively large χ2/dof=253.8/175, and there was clear excess above 10 keV. In an attempt to reduce the χ2 value, we next added another bremsstrahlung component to the model. Figure [\ref=fig:xis_pin_fit]b shows the best fit spectrum and residuals. The best fit value was kTlow = 3.48+ 0.59- 1.19 keV and kThigh = 22.9+    ∞- 12.9 keV with χ2/dof=185.9/173. These values are similar to those from the Ginga spectral analysis, in which the temperatures were kTlow = 2.71 keV and kThigh = 11.6 keV [\citep=fink1994]. Although the two thermal bremsstrahlung model is statistically acceptable, the temperature of the hotter component, kThigh, is probably too high to reflect thermal emission from the remnant. At face value, it suggests a shock speed of a few thousand km s- 1, but recent work indicates that very little electron heating occurs in such high speed shocks, since the level of electron heating is observed to decrease strongly with increasing shock speed [\citep=rakowski2003]. The actual shock velocity corresponding to a 22.9 keV electron temperature in Tycho's SNR would have to be so high as to be unreasonable. Moreover, the upper limit on the higher temperature component is not constrained as shown in figure [\ref=fig:xispin_brbr_cont]. This strongly suggests that the harder spectral component is of nonthermal origin, rather than thermal.

In our ultimate model, we fitted the spectrum with a thermal bremsstrahlung component and a power-law. Figure [\ref=fig:xis_pin_fit]c shows the model spectra and residuals. The best fit parameters were kT = 4.71+ 0.66- 1.02 keV and αp = 2.69+ 0.23- 1.27 with χ2/dof=185.9/173. The power-law model flux at 1 keV is 7.3×  10- 2 ph cm- 2 s- 1 keV- 1, which corresponds to the 10-20 keV band model flux of 1.3×  10- 11 ergs cm- 2 s- 1. From these results, we conclude that the power-law component with αp = 2.69 extends beyond 20 keV, which is the uppermost energy of the Ginga observations [\citep=fink1994], up to at least 30 keV.

Discussion

Origin of the hard X-ray emission

We have found that the hard power-law tail of Tycho's SNR's spectrum extends up to energies of at least 30 keV with a photon index of ~  2.69. The photon index is consistent with those observed by Chandra from the rim regions of the SNR in 0.5-10 keV low energy band [\citep=hwang2002] [\citep=warren2005] [\citep=cassam2007]. We further verified that the overall normalization of the power-law component in the integrated Chandra spectrum is consistent with the power-law normalization we found here. Thus, we conclude that the featureless power-law spectra observed in the Chandra energy region naturally extends to the Suzaku HXD-PIN energy region up to at least 30 keV.

Roll-off frequency of the synchrotron spectrum

The steep slope of the power-law model (αp = 2.69) indicates that the synchrotron emission we observe in the Suzaku energy region is above the roll-off frequency of the spectrum extrapolated from the radio regime. Assuming a power-law electron number spectrum N(E) with an exponential cutoff energy of

[formula]

where E max is the maximum electron energy, we can estimate the synchrotron roll-off frequency. Using the electron spectrum, we can simply derive the photon spectrum from radio to X-ray by superposing the single particle synchrotron emissivities assuming a constant magnetic field. This spectral model is implemented in the XSPEC package as an srcut model [\citep=reynolds1999]. We fitted the XIS and PIN spectra with a thermal bremsstrahlung, an srcut model, and Gaussian lines correspond to Cr, Mn, Fe Kα, and Fe Kβ. In the fits, we fixed the Gaussian parameters and the temperature to kT = 4.71 keV which were derived in §[\ref=subsect:broadband_spectra], while the parameters of the srcut model were left free. As shown in figure [\ref=fig:xispin_brsr]a, the fit was successfull with χ2/dof=187.4/173. Although the parameters were rather unconstrained as shown in figure [\ref=fig:xispin_brsr]b, the obtained radio spectral index, α = 0.66, is in a good agreement with the measured value of α = 0.65 [\citep=kothes2006], and the implied radio flux density at 1 GHz, 45 Jy, is not far from the actual measurement (60 Jy; [\cite=kothes2006]). Therefore, our srcut fit to be physically appropriate. Then, adopting α = 0.65, we obtain a roll-off frequency of [formula] keV, which is slightly higher than that derived by Chandra ([formula] keV; [\cite=cassam2007]).

The roll-off frequency νrolloff is related to the maximum electron energy E max as

[formula]

where B represents the magnetic field strength. [\citet=warren2005] present a summary of magnetic field values and find values in the range 100 to 400 μG. Then, equation ([\ref=eq:rolloff]) yields E max  =  23 TeV with 100 μG, or 12 TeV for 400 μ G. Even if we use the fiducial magnetic field in our Galaxy, 10 μG, the maximum electron energy is only 72 TeV.

These maximum electron energies are two to three orders of magnitudes below the break energy ("knee") of the cosmic-ray spectrum around 1000 TeV. [\citet=reynolds1999] pointed out that the E max values of all Galactic supernova remnants they studied with ASCA data were well below the knee energy. To evaluate the role of radiative cooling on the electron energy spectrum, we approximate the synchrotron radiation loss timescale τloss as

[formula]

With our estimate of E max  =  23 TeV and magnetic field strength of 100 μG, τloss is 52 years. Since the time scale is smaller than the age of Tycho's SNR (435 years), the electron spectrum should suffer strongly from synchrotron cooling. This has been directly detected in the Chandra data of Tycho's SNR as spectral steepening in the nonthermal emission across the featureless, thin filaments at the rim [\citet=cassam2007].

Abundance of Cr, Mn, and Fe

We discovered He-like Ca Kβ, and underionized states of Cr Kα, Mn Kα, and Fe Kβ lines from Tycho's SNR for the first time. The ionization degrees of Cr and Mn were estimated to be similar to that of Fe Kα (Ne-like or there-abouts). To convert the measured line fluxes or equivalent widths (table [\ref=table:lines]) into elemental abundances, a detailed emissivity calculation is needed. However, this is beyond the scope of the present paper, since the current models that calculate X-ray emission under the nonequilibrium ionization conditions do not include the species Cr and Mn.

The relative abundances of trace elements such as Cr and Mn are sensitive to the Type Ia supernova explosion mechanism [\citep=iwamoto1999], and therefore should provide an important diagnostic for these explosions. However, the compositionally stratified nature of the supernova ejecta coupled with the inward progression of the reverse shock, means that great care needs to be taken when comparing observed line fluxes and yields from model calculations. In particular, a good fraction of the Fe produced in the explosion that Tycho Brahe observed in 1572 still sits unshocked and cold in the center of the remnant [\citep=badenes2006]. To fully interpret the results presented here will require accounting for the ejecta structure and its subsequent hydrodynamical evolution to the remnant phase. Cr and Mn Kα lines were detected previously only from W49B (in which the X-ray emitting gas is nearly in collisional ionization equilibrium), where the abundances were found to be consistent with solar values [\citep=hwang2000] [\citep=miceli2006]. Detailed emissivity calculations for trace species in nonequilibrium hot plasmas are strongly encouraged to open this new method for supernova nucleosynthesis diagnostics.

Conclusions

We report the first observation of Tycho's SNR by the Suzaku satellite. We focused on the X-ray spectra above 4 keV and obtained the following results.

X-ray emission is securely detected up to at least 30 keV with a power-law index of 2.69. When combined with the Chandra spectra at Tycho's rim regions, it is natural to interpret that the emission comes from synchrotron radiation.

We discovered four emission lines. The line central energies are 4.56, 5.48, 5.95 and 7.11 keV, corresponding to He-like Ca Kβ, and low ionized Cr Kα, Mn Kα, and Fe Kβ blends, respectively. When combined with detailed emissivity calculations and evolutionary models for the remnant X-ray emission, these new lines should provide important new diagnostics to constrain the nature of thermonuclear supernovae.
