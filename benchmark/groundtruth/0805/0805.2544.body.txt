Rotational mixing in close binaries

Introduction

Rotation plays an important role in the evolution of massive stars: it causes deformation of the star due to the centrifugal force, it interplays with stellar mass loss, and it can induce instabilities leading to internal mixing of the star. Mixing induced by rotation has been successful in explaining the ratio of red to blue super giants and it has been invoked to explain the helium and nitrogen enhancements observed in OB stars [\citep=Heger+Langer00] [\citep=Maeder+Meynet00].

Although extensive literature exists on the subject, the efficiency of rotationally induced mixing is still very uncertain. The VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars [\citep=Evans+05], which resulted in rotational velocities and surface abundances of about one thousand O and early B stars provided a major step forward. However it raised more questions than it answered regarding rotational mixing [\citep=Hunter+07]. This motivated us to formulate potential observational tests to constrain the corresponding uncertain physical parameters. For this purpose we focus on tidally locked binaries.

The advantage of using binaries is that the major stellar parameters, such as the masses, radii and effective temperatures, can be accurately determined [\citep=hilditch+05] and also, if high resolution spectra are available, the surface abundances. This enables us to test our stellar models directly against well understood systems [\citep=demink+07]. A second advantage of using close binaries is that the tidal forces synchronize the spin period of the stars with the orbital period, such that Pspin  =  Porbit. This enables us to determine the rotation rate of the stars much more accurately than in the case of single stars, where it can only be estimated from v sin i, derived from spectral fitting. The inclination i of th rotation axis is generally not known for a particular single star.

In this contribution we use of rotating single stellar models (as published by [\citet=Yoon+06], to which we refer for details) to demonstrate two predictions for detached tidally locked binaries. In Section [\ref=sec:surf] we discuss the surface enhancement which can be expected in close binaries. In Section [\ref=sec:caseM] we discuss a new evolutionary binary scenario for the most massive close binaries, case M, in which rotational mixing is so efficient that the stars stay compact and avoid any Roche lobe overflow.

Surface abundances

The faster the initial rotation of a star of a given mass, the more efficient is rotational mixing. For example a 20 solar mass single star rotating with an initial equatorial rotational velocity of 180 km/s (corresponding to a spin period of about 1.5 days) enhances its surface nitrogen abundance by about 0.5 dex over the course of its main sequence evolution.

Figure [\ref=fig:N] shows the surface N abundance at the end of core H burning for the grid of single stellar models published by [\citet=Yoon+06]. In a tidally locked binary the spin period corresponds to the orbital period. The figure therefore shows the maximum surface abundances which we can expect for close detached binaries. For example the sample of OB type binaries with orbital periods ranging from 1-5 days by [\citet=hilditch+05] should show enhanced N abundances by up to 0.4 dex. Currently no spectra are available of these systems with high enough resolution to determine the surface abundances. In more massive systems the enhancements will be even larger. In principle even one well-determined binary systems could serve as a strong test case for rotational mixing. In fact, even if in close binaries mixing is enhanced by processes such as tides or irradiation, these observations can be used to set an upper limit to the efficiency of rotational mixing.

Chemically homogeneous evolution in binaries

In rapidly rotating stars mixing can be so efficient that the stars fail to form the usual core/envelope structure. These stars stay compact during core H burning and gradually become WR stars [\citep=Maeder87] [\citep=Yoon+Langer05], illustrated by the cartoon in Figure [\ref=fig:cartoon1]. This type of evolution has been suggested to lead to the formation of long GRB progenitors [\citep=Yoon+Langer05] [\citep=Cantiello+07].

Figure [\ref=fig:bin] shows that for tidally locked binary systems there is a small range in the parameter space where chemically homogeneous evolution can occur in synchronously rotating binaries. This implies that in such close massive binaries the stars will stay compact and avoid Roche-lobe overflow completely (see the cartoon in Figure [\ref=fig:cartoon2]).

To demonstrate that this situation, predicted on the basis of single stellar models, can actually occur in binary evolution models we performed some preliminary calculations. Figure [\ref=fig:hrd] shows the evolutionary track of a non-rotating 100 [formula] star at a metallicity of Z  =  10- 5 together with four tracks corresponding to the evolution of a 100 [formula] star in a close binary with an equal mass companion, in orbits with initial periods of 1.7, 1.4, 1.2 and 1.15 days, respectively.

According to non-rotating models such close systems would fill their Roche lobe during their core hydrogen burning and start so called Case A mass transfer [\citep=Kippenhahn+Weigert67]. The stars in the 1.7 day and the 1.4 day systems stay more compact than the corresponding non-rotating star, due to efficient rotational mixing. However, they cannot avoid Roche lobe overflow before the end of their main sequence evolution.

Although one may intuitively expect that an even closer system would fill its Roche lobe earlier, the primary in the 1.2 day orbit system stays compact enough to avoid mass transfer during the main sequence. It becomes brighter at almost constant radius until central hydrogen exhaustion. Then it contracts until the small amount of H that is still left in the outer layers ignites. The star expands during H shell burning and fills its Roche lobe. In the slightly more compact system with an initial orbital period of 1.15 days, mixing is so efficient that at the end of hydrogen burning both stars are basically pure helium stars, and Roche lobe overflow is completely avoided.

Conclusion

Close detached binaries are potentially strong test cases to constrain the uncertain physics of rotational mixing. Furthermore, we show that, contrary to expectation, the very closest massive binaries could avoid mass transfer altogether. In addition to the classic binary cases A, B and C [\citep=Kippenhahn+Weigert67] [\citep=Lauterborn70], we find a new evolutionary scenario for very close massive binaries, which we named Case M, where the letter M refers to the importance of mixing. In this case both stars are so efficiently mixed, that they remain compact and avoid Roche-lobe overflow during the main sequence, and probably beyond.

According to this evolutionary scenario, double helium star systems in very close orbits can be made. Perhaps WR20a, a binary consisting of two detached core hydrogen burning stars of about 80 solar masses in a 3.6 day orbit [\citep=Bonanos+04], is an example of this type of evolution. It remains to be investigated whether this evolutionary scenario can lead to the formation of two long GRB progenitors.
