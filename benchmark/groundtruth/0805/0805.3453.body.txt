Pseudogap Value in the Energy Spectrum of LaOFeAs: Fixed Spin Moment Treatment

Stimulated by the discovery of a new class of high-Tc superconductors on the base of LaOFeAs compound [\cite=Kamihara-08], a lot of investigations of the electronic and magnetic structure of this nonsuperconducting parent compound in frames of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) were performed [\cite=Singh-08] [\cite=Cao-08] [\cite=Mazin-08] [\cite=Xu-08] [\cite=Ma-08]. These calculations were successful in prediction of not only magnetic instability [\cite=Singh-08] [\cite=Xu-08], but even an exact type of magnetic structure of LaOFeAs [\cite=Mazin-08] [\cite=Dong-08].

Calculated iron magnetic moment is close to 2 μB [\cite=Ma-08] [\cite=Pickett-08]. However, experiments indicate much smaller value. Powder neutron diffraction measurements [\cite=Cruz-08] give 0.36(5) μB. Local probe measurements of magnetic properties of LaOFeAs such as 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy [\cite=Kitao-08] together with muon spin relaxation [\cite=Klauss-08] indicate the values of ~  0.35 μB and 0.25(5) μB, correspondingly.

The situation when DFT calculations predict larger spin magnetic moment in comparison with experimental one is rare and known only for few systems (e.g. MnSi, ZrZn2 etc.). The inconsistency between experimental and calculated magnetic moments in these materials may be ascribed to spin fluctuations which lead to the suppression of magnetic moment [\cite=Mazin-03]. Nevertheless, LaOFeAs is an outstanding compound even among these systems because the ratio μcalc  /  μexp is extraordinary large, ~  6, and more importantly since Fe ions in simple atomic picture is expected to have S = 2 which cannot be easily suppressed by any quantum fluctuations.

The other known experimental parameters which can be compared with their theoretical values are specific heat coefficient γ related to the density of states (DOS) on the Fermi level N(EF) as [formula] and Pauli susceptibility χ  =  μ2BN(EF). Specific heat coefficient can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of the heat capacity. Unfortunately, this parameter is ill defined experimentally, i.e. strongly depends on the temperature range used in the fitting procedure. It was estimated by different groups to be 3.7 mJ/(mol·  K2) [\cite=Dong-08], 0.9 mJ/(mol·  K2) [\cite=McGuire-08] and 0.69 mJ/(mol·  K2) [\cite=Mu-08]. However, γ obtained in nonmagnetic DFT calculations [\cite=Singh-08] [\cite=Xu-08] overestimates the largest experimental value almost in two times. The results of magnetic calculations for the real striped antiferromagnetic structure [\cite=Pickett-08] improve the situation. They are close to the intermediate experimental γ value. However, one could consider this coincidence as accidental since the electronic structure of this antiferromagnetic solution corresponds to the large iron magnetic moment. Susceptibility calculated in frames of nonmagnetic DFT is 8.5×  10- 5 emu/mol [\cite=Singh-08]. At the same time the flat region of experimental susceptibility curve has the value of ~  50×  10- 5 emu/mol [\cite=Kamihara-08] [\cite=Nomura-08] - 6 times larger than calculated one.

There is an experimental indication of the formation of partial energy gap (or pseudogap) around the Fermi level which removes parts of the DOS or few bands from the Fermi energy at the phase transition from paramagnetic to spin density wave (SDW) state. Direct experimental estimations of pseudogap Epg is based on the results of reflectivity measurements [\cite=Dong-08]. The pseudogap where the decrease of optical absorption spectra is observed at different temperatures corresponding to paramagnetic and SDW states is in the range of 150~  350 cm- 1 (19~  43 meV). The value of the pseudogap due to SDW formation evaluated from thermal transport experiments equals to 210 K [\cite=McGuire-08] which corresponds to 18 meV. Results of temperature-dependent angle-integrated laser photoemission study for fluorine doped compound indicate ~  100 meV pseudogap [\cite=Ishida-08], whereas high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy [\cite=Sato-08] gives the pseudogap value above Tc of 15-20 meV.

The evaluation of the relative reduction of the DOS in the vicinity of the Fermi energy due to formation of such pseudogap is more indirect procedure. Based on the results of susceptibility measurements [\cite=Nomura-08] one can deduce from the values of Pauli-like susceptibility curves at high and low temperatures that the change in the N(EF) does not exceed 20%. The same value of ~  20% one could extract from the conductivity curves of Ref. [\cite=Dong-08] keeping in mind that conductivity is proportional to N2(E) in the proximity of EF. Analysis of the specific heat at various temperatures [\cite=McGuire-08] suggests 70% reduction of N(E) around EF at paramagnetic - SDW transition.

Thus for LaOFeAs, one can assume that there is a decrease in DOS near the Fermi energy of tens percent with paramagnetic - SDW transition which corresponds to pseudogap formation of 20~  100 meV. SDW state is characterized by iron spin magnetic moment of 0.2~  0.4 μB, specific heat coefficient of 1~  4 mJ/(mol·  K2) and susceptibility coefficient of ~  50×  10- 5 emu/mol. Conventional DFT calculations (both nonmagnetic and antiferromagnetic) fail in the correct description of these quantities.

In the present paper we show that fixed spin moment DFT calculations with the magnetic moment fixed at experimental value can significantly improve an agreement with the experiments with regard to the values of specific heat, pseudogap and relative decrease of the N(EF) value.

The calculations were performed within the framework of the Tight-Binding Linear Muffin-Tin Orbitals (TB LMTO) method [\cite=Andersen-84] using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), where exchange potential was taken in Perdew-Wang form [\cite=Perdew-Wang]. Experimentally determined [\cite=Cruz-08] structure parameters and atomic positions for tetragonal phase and collinear striped antiferromagnetic order of Fe ions in layer were used. We assumed ferromagnetic interlayer interaction due to negligible influence of the antiparallel alignment of spins between different FeAs layers and for the simplicity of discussion. The La(6s,6p,5d,4f), Fe(4s,4p,3d), O(3s,2p,3d) and As(4s,4p,4d) orbitals were included into the basis set. The integration in the course of the self-consistency iterations was performed over a mesh of 18  ×  18  ×  12 k-points in the irreducible part of Brillouin zone. We checked that such amount of k-points is enough for the precise calculation of the Fermi level position EF and value of the density of states at the Fermi level N(EF). Fine mesh is important due to the nesting bands near EF. Calculations were performed in [formula] (four formula units) unit cell appropriate for description of striped antiferromagnetic state. Crystallographic x and y axes were directed from iron to its nearest iron neighbors and ferromagnetic chains were running along x direction.

Fig. [\ref=NM] demonstrates the results of nonmagnetic calculations. The band structure agrees with that obtained previously [\cite=Pickett-08]. The Fe bands mainly of t2g origin cross the Fermi level. One may notice two-dimensional character of the band structure and clear signs of Fermi surface nesting in Γ - X and Y - Γ directions.

The nesting effect is usually illustrated in the figure of Fermi surface. In order to reveal nesting in the simple band structure graph one may plot it along S - Γ line for conventional a  ×  a  ×  c unit cell; the result is given in the insert of Fig. [\ref=NM]. This S - Γ direction corresponds to Y - Γ (or X - Γ) line for enlarged [formula] unit cell. When the unit cell is doubled, left half of grey region folds to the right half. The cross of the folded bands happens just on the Fermi level.

The specific heat and susceptibility coefficients recalculated from N(EF) obtained in nonmagnetic DFT approach are γNM  =  5.3 mJ/(mol·  K2) and χNM=7.2×  10- 5 emu/mol. That agrees with values calculated before.

The total energy difference between nonmagnetic and antiferromagnetic (which is energetically more favored) states is 116 meV/(atom Fe) which is in a good agreement with the result of Ref. [\cite=Pickett-08]. Substantial energy gap between different magnetic solutions together with the large magnetic moment (see below) shifts the system away from the quantum critical point, where spin fluctuations may play an important role. Band structure for striped antiferromagnetic state is shown in Fig. [\ref=AFM] It differs essentially from the nonmagnetic picture. In particular, in the vicinity of the Fermi level in Γ  -  X direction there is only one band of [formula] character. The other 4 bands are moved away from the Fermi level due to the Stoner splitting. In Y  -  Γ direction three bands remain. Two of them (dxy and dyz) have the same origin like as in nonmagnetic state. And third band originated from [formula] and [formula] orbitals which were completely occupied in nonmagnetic case has been appeared around EF.

One can define the pseudogap as an energy region around the Fermi level where number of bands in Fig. [\ref=AFM] is essentially decreased in comparison with that in Fig. [\ref=NM]. It is natural to define it between maximum of parabola at X k-point and minimum of high-lying parabola in Γ  -  X direction (see grey stripe in Fig. [\ref=AFM]). The pseudogap defined in such a way is estimated to be 380 meV which is much larger than experimental expectations.

Calculated iron magnetic moment equals to 1.77 μB and specific heat coefficient γMAG  =  0.99 mJ/(mol·  K2). This agrees with the experimental estimations of γ [\cite=McGuire-08]. However, going from nonmagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase the calculated value of N(EF) changes by factor of 6 (600% instead of tens percent).

This inconsistency in the values of magnetic moment, width of the pseudogap and too drastic change in N(EF) going from paramagnetic to magnetic state demands the explanation. Below by the use of fixed spin moment procedure we simulate experimental value of the magnetic moment and investigate how N(EF) and the width of the pseudogap is changing upon decrease of the spin moment value.

Band structure corresponding to the fixed spin moment value 0.36 μB is presented in Fig. [\ref=FSM-0.365]. Now it looks very similar to nonmagnetic picture. The remarkable difference occurs along Γ  -  X direction: dxy and dzx bands are spin-splitted and first of them is removed from the vicinity of the Fermi level whereas [formula] is still crossing EF. There is no dramatic reconstruction of bands along Y  -  Γ direction. One can conclude that upon transition from nonmagnetic to magnetic state the first changes of band structure occur along Γ  -  X line; then the bands along Y  -  Γ are involving to the formation of magnetic moment.

Fixed spin moment calculation results in a significant growth of the specific heat coefficient, which equals to γFSM  =  2.0 mJ/(mol·  K2) in this case in a good agreement with experiment. The pseudogap which now could be defined as it's indicated by grey stripe in Fig. [\ref=FSM-0.365] decreases down to 180 meV, which is still larger than experimental one.

It is interesting to note that further decrease of the magnetic moment in the fixed spin moment calculation (Fig. [\ref=FSM-0.255]) leads to even better agreement with experiment with respect to the value of the pseudogap. For one of the reported values of μ = 0.25 μB it decreases down to 130 meV. The specific heat parameter is calculated to be 2.4 mJ/(mol·  K2), and then the change in N(EF) in nonmagnetic and magnetic states is only 55% in reasonable agreement with experimental estimations.

Semi-empirical fixed spin moment approach demonstrates that the correspondence of experimentally known parameters of electronic structure of LaOFeAs is essentially improved in comparison with conventional magnetic calculations, if the magnetic moment is kept at low value ~  0.3 μB found in the experiment. However, even with reduced spin moment value the calculated pseudogap (130 meV) remains larger than the experimental one (20-40 meV).

In our opinion, an account for dynamical correlations which no doubts exist for d shell of iron may lead both to essential reduction of spin moment value and renormalization of energy spectrum in the vicinity of the Fermi level for decreasing of pseudogap.
