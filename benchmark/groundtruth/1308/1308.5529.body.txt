Introduction

We consider the spatial lunar three-body problem, in which two bodies form a binary system (the inner pair) which is slightly perturbed by the third far-away body. By considering two relative positions, the study of the three-body problem is reduced to the study of the motions of these relative positions. The relative position of the inner pair and the relative position of the third body with respect to the mass center of the inner pair thus describe almost Keplerian orbits that we suppose to be elliptic, with instantaneous semi major axes a1 <  < a2. We decompose the Hamiltonian F as

[formula]

in which FKep describes two uncoupled elliptic Keplerian motions, and Fpert (which causes the secular evolutions of the elliptic orbits) is small provide that a1 is sufficiently small compared to a2.

Due to the proper-degeneracy of the Kepler problem (all of its bounded orbits are closed), to study the dynamics of F by a perturbative study of FKep, it is important to study the higher order effect of the (slow) secular evolution of the Keplerian orbits given by the perturbation. In the lunar three-body problem, the smallness of a1 with respect to a2 implies the lack of all lower-order resonances of the two Keplerian frequencies. As a result, the corresponding elimination procedure does not require any arithmetic conditions on the two Keplerian frequencies, and the secular evolution of the Keplerian orbits is approximately given by the secular systems, which are the successive averaged systems of Fpert over the two fast Keplerian angles.

In the planar case, the 4-degree-of-freedom secular systems are invariant under the Keplerian [formula]-action and the [formula]-action of rotations, and are thus integrable, which allows J. F�joz to carry out a global study of their dynamics and establish families of quasi-periodic orbits of the planar three-body problem in [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar]. The integrability of the secular systems is no longer guaranteed in the spatial case, which has 6 degrees of freedom with (only) a [formula]-symmetry. Nevertheless, if we expand the secular systems in powers of the semi major axis ratio [formula] (the natural small parameter of the lunar problem), then the first non-trivial coefficient Fquad, i.e. the quadrupolar system, is noticed by Harrington [\cite=Harrington1968] to have an additional [formula]-symmetry giving rise to an additional first integral G2 (the norm of the outer angular momentum), and is thus integrable. Integrable approximating systems can thus be obtained by a further single-frequency averaging procedure over the conjugate angle of G2.

Aside from the degenerate inner ellipses, the dynamics of the quadrupolar system is studied globally by Lidov-Ziglin [\cite=LidovZiglin] (see also [\cite=FerrerOsacar], [\cite=FaragoLaskar]). By verifying of the required non-degeneracy conditions and applying a sophisticated iso-chronous version of the KAM theorem, we confirm that almost every invariant Lagrangian tori and some normally elliptic invariant isotropic tori of the quadrupolar system give rise to irrational invariant tori of the spatial lunar three-body problem after being reduced by the [formula]-symmetry (Theorems [\ref=FarFromCollisionMotions] and [\ref=elliptictori]). These results extend some former results of Jefferys-Moser [\cite=JefferysMoser] of the spatial lunar three-body problem concerning normally hyperbolic invariant isotropic tori to the normally elliptic tori and the Lagrangian tori. A theorem of J. Pöschel confirms that each of these Lagrangian tori is accumulated by periodic orbits in this reduced system (Theorem [\ref=AccumulatingPeriodicOrbits]).

By application of KAM theorems, the existence of various families of quasi-periodic solutions of the Newtonian N-body problem, planar or spatial, was shown in e.g. [\cite=Arnold1963], [\cite=JefferysMoser], [\cite=Lieberman], [\cite=Robutel1995], [\cite=BiascoChierchiaValdinoci], [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar], [\cite=FejozStability], [\cite=ChierchiaPinzariPlanetary], [\cite=MeyerPalacianYanguas2011]. Due to the frequent non-integrability of the approximating systems, most of these work are local studies in some neighborhoods of the phase space, with the only exception of [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar]. Based on a global study of the secular dynamics of the lunar case, our results also extend F�joz's families of quasi-periodic solutions of the planar secular systems to the spatial lunar case.

Hamiltonian Formalism of the Three-body Problem

The Hamiltonian System

We study the Hamiltonian system with phase space

[formula]

(standard) symplectic form

[formula]

and the Hamiltonian function

[formula]

in which q0,q1,q2 denote the positions of the three particles, and p0,p1,p2 denote their conjugate momenta respectively. The Euclidean norm of a vector in [formula] is denoted by [formula]. The gravitational constant has been set to 1.

Jacobi Decomposition

The Hamiltonian F is invariant under translations in positions. To symplectically reduce the system by this symmetry, we switch to the Jacobi coordinates (Pi,Qi),i = 0,1,2, with in which

[formula]

The Hamiltonian F is thus independent of Q0 due to the symmetry. We fix P0 = 0 and reduce the translation symmetry by eliminating Q0. In the (reduced) coordinates (Pi,Qi),i = 1,2, the function F = F(P1,Q1,P2,Q2) describes the motions of two fictitious particles.

We further decompose the Hamiltonian F(P1,Q1,P2,Q2) into two parts F = FKep + Fpert, where the Keplerian part FKep and the perturbing part Fpert are respectively

[formula]

with (as in [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar])

[formula]

We shall only be interested in the region of the phase space where F = FKep + Fpert is a small perturbation of a pair of Keplerian elliptic motions. Let a1,a2 be the semi major axes of the (instanteneous) inner and outer ellipses respectively. We shall further restrict us to the lunar three-body problem, characterized by the fact that the ratio of the semi major axes by [formula] is sufficiently small.

Delaunay Coordinates

The Delaunay coordinates

[formula]

for both elliptic motions are defined as the following:

in which e1, e2 are the eccentricities and i1,i2 are the inclinations of the two ellipses respectively. From their definitions, we see that these coordinates are well-defined only when neither of the ellipses is circular, horizontal or rectilinear. We refer to [\cite=Lecons], [\cite=DelaunayPoincare] or [\cite=FejozHabilitation] for more detailed discussions of Delaunay coordinates.

In these coordinates, the Keplerian part FKep is in the action-angle form

[formula]

The proper degeneracy of the Kepler problem can be seen by the fact that FKep depends only on 2 of the action variables out of 6. As a result, in order to study the dynamics of F, it is crucial to look at higher order effects arising from Fpert.

Reduction of the SO(3)-Symmetry: Jacobi's Elimination of the Nodes

The group SO(3) acts on Π by simultaneously rotating the positions Q1,Q2 and the momenta P1,P2 around the origin. This action is Hamiltonian for the standard symplectic form on Π and it leaves the Hamiltonian F invariant. Its moment map is the total angular momentum [formula], in which [formula] and [formula]. To reduce F by this SO(3)-symmetry, we fix [formula] to a regular value (i.e. [formula]) and then reduce the system from the SO(2)-symmetry around [formula]. Finally, we obtain from F a Hamiltonian system with 4 degrees of freedom.

Jacobi's elimination of the nodes

The plane perpendicular to [formula] is invariant. It is called the Laplace plane. We choose it to be the reference plane.

Since the angular momenta [formula], [formula] of the two Keplerian motions and the total angular momentum [formula] must lie in the same plane, the node lines of the orbital planes of the two ellipses in the Laplace plane must coincide (i.e. h1 = h2  +  π). Therefore, by fixing the Laplace plane as the reference plane, we can express H1,H2 as functions of G1, G2 and [formula]:

[formula]

since [formula] is vertical, [formula].

We can then reduce the system by the SO(2)-symmetry around the direction of [formula]. The number of degrees of freedom of the system is then reduced from 6 to 4.

The Averaging Procedure

In the lunar case, the two Keplerian frequencies do not appear at the same magnitude of the small parameter α, which enables us to build normal forms up to any order, without necessarily considering the interaction between the two Keplerian frequencies by an asynchronous elimination procedure that we are going to describe, which was carried out by Jefferys and Moser in [\cite=JefferysMoser], with an alternative presented in [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar] in which the terminology asynchronous region is coined. In order to build integrable approximating systems, we shall further average over g2 to obtain the secular-integrable systems by an additional single frequency averaging.

Asynchronous Region

We fix the masses m0,m1,m2 arbitrarily, and suppose that the eccentricities e1 and e2 are bounded away from 0,1, so there exist positive real numbers [formula], such that

[formula]

Recall that the small parameter [formula] is the ratio of the semi major axes. We suppose that

[formula]

in which [formula] (see Appendix [\ref=section:estimates] for the choice of [formula]). In particular,

[formula]

i.e., the two ellipses are always bounded away from each other for all the time.

Without loss of generality, we fix two real numbers [formula], such that the relation [formula] holds for all time.

The subset of the phase space Π in which Delaunay coordinates for both ellipses are regular coordinates, and satisfy these restrictions is denoted by P* (what could be called the asynchronous region): it can thus be regarded (by Delaunay coordinates) as a subset of [formula]. The function Fpert can thus be regarded as an analytic function on [formula].

Let ν1,ν2 denote the two Keplerian frequencies: [formula].

Let [formula] and Ts be the s-neighborhood of [formula] in [formula]. Let T,s be the s-neighborhood of a set [formula] in Ts. The complex modulus of a transformation is the maximum of the complex moduli of its components. We use |  ·  | to denote the modulus of either a function or a transformation.

Lemma [\ref=Appendix_A:_lem_3_ddd] states that there exists some small real number s > 0, such that in TP*,s, [formula], in which the constant [formula] is independent of α.

Asynchronous Elimination of the Fast Angles

For any (fixed) [formula] , there exist an analytic Hamiltonian [formula] independent of the fast angles l1,l2, and an analytic symplectomorphism φn:P*  ⊃    →  φn(), [formula]-close to the identity, such that

[formula]

on T,s'' for some open set   ⊂  P*, and some real number s'' with 0 < s''  <  s. Moreover, the relative measure of [formula] in P* tends to 1 when α tends to 0.

The strategy is to first eliminate l1 up to sufficiently large order, and then eliminate l2 to the desired order. We describe the first step of eliminating l1.

To eliminate the angle l1 in the perturbing function Fpert, we look for an auxiliary analytic Hamiltonian Ĥ. We denote its Hamiltonian vector field by XĤ and its flow by φt. The symplectic coordinate transformation that we are looking for is given by the time-1 map φ1(: = φt|t = 1) of XĤ.

Define the first order complementary part F1comp,1 by the equation

[formula]

in which XĤ is seen as a derivation operator. Let

[formula]

be the average of Fpert over l1, and [formula] be its zero-average part.

As the two Keplerian frequencies do not appear at the same magnitude of α, we do not need to ask Ĥ to solve the (standard) cohomological equation:

[formula]

instead, we just need Ĥ to solve the perturbed cohomological equation

[formula]

We thus set

[formula]

as long as ν1  ≠  0, which is indeed satisfied for any Keplerian frequency (of an elliptic motion). This amounts to proceed with a single frequency elimination for l1. We have

[formula]

We obtain by Cauchy inequality that in TP*,s - s0, [formula] for some 0 < s0 < s / 2. Shrinking from TP*,s - s0 to TP*  *,s - s0 - s1, where P*  * is an open subset of P*, so that φ1(TP*  *,s - s0 - s1)  ⊂  TP*,s - s0, with s - s0 - s1 > 0. The time-1 map φ1 of XH thus satisfies [formula] in TP*  *,s - s0  -  s1. The function φ*1F is analytic in TP*  *,s - s0 - s1.

Now F is conjugate to

[formula]

and |F1comp,1| is of order [formula]: indeed, analogous to [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar], the complementary part

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

The first order averaging with respect to l1 is then accomplished.

One proceeds analogously and eliminates the dependence of the Hamiltonian of l1 up to order [formula] for any chosen [formula]. The Hamiltonian F is then analytically conjugate to

[formula]

in which the expression [formula] is independent of l1, and F1comp,n is of order [formula].

After this, we proceed by eliminating l2 from

[formula]

which is again a single frequency averaging and it can be carried out as long as ν2  ≠  0, which is always true under our hypothesis.

The Hamiltonian generating the transformation for the first step of averaging over l2 is

[formula]

The other steps are similar to the first step of eliminating l1. By eliminating l2, the Hamiltonian F is conjugate to

[formula]

in which the (first order) secular system

[formula]

and the n-th order secular system

[formula]

is independent of l1,l2, with

[formula]

in T,s'' for some open subset   ⊂  P* and some 0 < s'' < s both of which are obtained by finite steps of constructions analogously to that we have described for the first step elimination of l1. In particular, the set [formula] is obtained by shrinking P* from its boundary by a distance of [formula]. We may thus set

[formula]

The function Fnsec is defined on a subset of the phase space Π and does not depend on the fast Keplerian angles. After fixing L1 and L2 and reducing by the Keplerian [formula]-symmetry, the reduced function is defined on a subset of the secular space, or the space of pairs of ellipses. By the construction presented in [\cite=Albouy], the secular space is seen to be homeomorphic to (S2  ×  S2)2. We keep the same notation Fnsec for the resulting function.

Secular-integrable Systems

Unlike the integrable planar secular systems, the spatial secular systems Fnsec remains to have 2 degrees of freedom after being reduced by the SO(3)-symmetry, and therefore they are a priori not integrable. As a result, in contrast to the planar case, they cannot directly serve as an "integrable approximating system" for our study.

In P*, the function F1sec is of order O(α3), and the functions Fcomp,n,n  ≥  2 are of order [formula]. We express Fnsec as

[formula]

and expand it in powers of α:

[formula]

As a consequence of Lemma [\ref=Legendre_Expansion], we see that

[formula]

Moreover, since Fncomp,n  ≥  1 is of order [formula], we have

[formula]

in particular

[formula]

As noticed by Harrington in [\cite=Harrington1968], the term F1,2sec is independent of g2, thus G2 is an additional first integral of the system F1,2sec. The system F1,2sec can then be reduced to one degree of freedom after reduction of the symmetries, hence it is integrable. We call Fquad: = F1,2sec the quadrupolar system.

The integrability of the quadrupolar Hamiltonian is, in Lidov and Ziglin's words, a "happy coincidence": it is due to the particular form of Fpert. Indeed, if one goes to even higher order expansions in powers of α, then in general the truncated Hamiltonian will no longer be independent of g2 (c.f. [\cite=LaskarBoue]).

To have better control of the perturbation so as to apply KAM theorems, we need to build higher order integrable approximations by eliminating g2 in the secular systems Fnsec. This is a single frequency elimination procedure and can be carried out everywhere as long as the frequency νquad,2 of g2 in Fquad is not zero.

Since the analytic function Fquad depends non trivially on G2 (See Section [\ref=QuadrupolarDynamics]), for any ε small enough, we have |νquad,2|  >  ε on an open subset [formula] of P* and locally relative measure of [formula] in P* tends to 1 when ε tends to 0. For any fixed ε, analogous to Subsection [\ref=Subsection:_Elimination_of_the_Fast_Angles], for small enough α, there exists an open subset [formula] in [formula] with local relative measure in [formula] tending to 1 when α tends to 0, such that on [formula] we can conjugate our system up to small terms of higher orders to the normal form that one gets by the standard elimination procedure (c.f. [\cite=ArnoldGeometrical]) to eliminate g2.

More precisely, after fixing the Laplace plane as the reference plane, as the elimination of l2 in the proof of Proposition [\ref=averaging], for the first step of elimination, we eliminate the angle g2 in FKep  +  α3(Fquad  +  αF1,3sec) by a symplectic transformation ψ3 close to identity, which is the time-1 map of the Hamiltonian

[formula]

We proceed analogously for higher order eliminations. We denote by ψn':  →  ψn'() the corresponding symplectic transformation, so that

[formula]

in which Fn' + 1secpert  =  O(αn' + 2) and [formula] are independent of g2.

Let

[formula]

we call it the (n,n')-th order secular-integrable system. We have

[formula]

For α small enough, the last two terms can be made arbitrarily small by choosing n,n' large enough.

The Quadrupolar Dynamics

The secular-integrable systems [formula] are O(α4) perturbations of α3Fquad, therefore for α small, the key to understand the dynamics of [formula] is to understand the dynamics of Fquad (seen as a function defined on a subset of the secular space). In this section, we shall reproduce some of the study of Lidov-Ziglin in [\cite=LidovZiglin].

After Jacobi's elimination of the nodes, the quadrupolar Hamiltonian takes the form

[formula]

in which [formula].

Notations: We separate the variables of the system and the parameters by a semicolon so as to make the difference between different reduced systems more apparent: The functions L1, L2, C and G2 are first integrals of Fquad(G1,g1,C,G2,L1,L2). If we fix these first integrals and reduce the system by the conjugate [formula]-symmetry, then C and G2 becomes parameters of the reduced system as well. The resulting system is thus written as Fquad(G1,g1;C,G2,L1,L2).

By applying the triangular inequality to the vectors [formula], [formula], [formula], we see that the parameters L1, C and G2 must satisfy the condition

[formula]

which defines the region of admissible parameters in the (C,G2)-parameter space for fixed L1. By triangular inequality and definition of G1, when C and G2 are fixed, the quantity |G1| belongs to the interval

G ≤ G ≤ G.

The KAM Theorem and Applications

In this section, we first give an analytic version of a powerful "hypothetical conjugacy" theorem (c.f. [\cite=FejozStability]), which does not depend on any non-degeneracy condition. We then discuss the classical (strong) iso-chronous non-degeneracy condition which guarantees the existence of KAM tori. Finally, a theorem of J.Pöschel is presented, which shows the existence of families of periodic solutions accumulating KAM tori.

Hypothetical Conjugacy Theorem

For p  ≥  1 and q  ≥  0, consider the phase space [formula] endowed with the standard symplectic form [formula]. All mappings are assumed to be analytic except when explicitly mentioned otherwise.

Let δ  >  0, q'∈{0,...,q}, q'' = q - q', [formula], and [formula]. Let Bp + 2qδ be the (p + 2q)-dimensional closed ball with radius δ centered at the origin in [formula], and Nϖ,β  =  Nϖ,β(δ,q') be the space of Hamiltonians [formula] of the form

[formula]

with [formula], [formula] and Z  =  (x,y). The isotropic torus [formula] is an invariant ϖ-quasi-periodic torus of N, and its normal dynamics is elliptic, hyperbolic, or a mixture of both types, with Floquet exponents β. The definitions of tensor operations can be found in e.g. [\cite=FejozStability].

Let   >  0 and   >  p - 1, |  ·  | be the [formula]-norm on [formula]. Let HD, = HD,(p,q',q'') be the set of vectors (ϖ,β) satisfying the following homogeneous Diophantine conditions:

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula] with [formula]. We have denoted (β1,...,βq') by β'. Let [formula] be the s-analytic norm of an analytic function, i.e., the supremum norm of its analytic extension to the s-neighborhood of its (real) domain in the complexified space [formula].

This theorem is an analytic version of the C∞ "hypothetical conjugacy theorem" of [\cite=FejozStability]. Its complete proof will appear in the article [\cite=FejozMoser] of J. F�joz. Actually, since analytic functions are C∞, except for the analyticity of the conjugation, other statements of the theorem directly follow from the "hypothetical conjugacy theorem" of [\cite=FejozStability].

An Iso-chronic KAM Theorem

We now assume that the Hamiltonians No = Noι and N'  =  N'ι depend analytically (actually C1-smoothly would suffice) on some parameter ι∈Bp + q1. Recall that, for each ι, Noι is of the form

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=KAM] can be applied to Noι and N'ι for each ι. We will now add some classical non-degeneracy condition to the hypotheses of the theorem, which ensure that the condition "(ϖι,βι)∈HD," actually occurs often in the set of parameters.

Call

[formula]

the set of "accessible" (,)-Diophantine unperturbed frequencies. The parameter is restricted to a smaller ball in order to avoid boundary problems.

Assume the map

[formula]

is a diffeomorphism onto its image. If ε is small enough and if [formula] for each ι, the following holds:

For every (ϖ,β)∈HDo there exists a unique ι∈Bp + q1 such that N'ι is symplectically conjugate to some N∈Nϖ,β. Moreover, there exists  > 0, > p - 1, such that the set

[formula]

has positive Lebesgue measure.

If ε is small, the map ι  ↦  (ϖι,βι) is C1-close to the map ι  ↦  (ϖoι,βoι) and is thus a diffeomorphism over Bp + q2 / 3 onto its image, which contains the positive measure set HDo for some  > 0,  ≥  p - 1. The first assertion then follows from Theorem [\ref=KAM]. Since the inverse map (ϖ,β)  ↦  ι is smooth, it sends sets of positive measure onto sets of positive measure.

Periodic Solutions Accumulating KAM Tori

A theorem of J. Pöschel (the last statement of [\cite=Poeschel]; see also [\cite=ChierchiaPeriodic]) permits us to show that there are families of periodic solutions accumulating the KAM Lagrangian tori. In our settings, this theorem can be stated in the following way:

Far from Collision Quasi-periodic Orbits of the Spatial Lunar Three-Body problem

Now let us consider the Hamiltonian [formula], seen as a system reduced by the SO(3)-symmetry. We now consider [formula] as defined on a subset of the (SO(3)-reduced) phase space instead of the secular space, which has 4 degrees of freedom.

To apply Corollary [\ref=cor:_isochron_nondeg], we start by verifying the non-degeneracy conditions in the system [formula]. As noted in Condition-Example [\ref=isochron_nondeg], due to the proper degeneracy of the system, we just have to verify the non-degeneracy conditions in different scales.

Let us first consider the Kepler part:

[formula]

Considered only as a function of L1 and L2, it is iso-chronically non-degenerate.

To obtain the secular non-degeneracies of the system [formula], let us first consider the quadrupolar system Fquad. From Figure [\ref=Fig:_quadrupolar_Phase_LZ], we see that for C  ≠  G2, in the (G1,g1)-space, three types of regions are foliated by four kinds of closed curves of Fquad(G1,g1;C,G2,L1,L2). They are regions around the elliptical singularities B inside the separatrix of A or A', and the regions from {G1 = G1,max} and {G1 = G1,min} up to the nearest separatrix. These regions in turn correspond to three types of regions in the (G1,g1,G2,g2)-space, foliated by invariant two-tori of the system Fquad(G1,g1,G2;C,L1,L2). We build action-angle coordinates, and let [formula] be an action variable in any one of these corresponding regions in the (G1,g1)-space. In Appendix [\ref=non-degeneracySecularFrequencyMap], we show that the quadrupolar frequency map is non-degenerate in a dense open set for almost all [formula] and [formula].

Finally, for any fixed C  ≠  0, the frequency map

[formula]

of FKep  +  α3Fquad is a local diffeomorphism in a dense open set Ω of the phase space Π symplectically reduced from the [formula]-symmetry, in which νquad,i,i = 1,2 are the two frequencies of the quadrupolar system Fquad(G1,g1,G2;C,L1,L2) in the (Gi,gi)-plans respectively, which are independent of α.

For any (n,n'), the Lagrangian tori of the system [formula] are O(α)-deformations of Lagrangian tori of α3Fquad. The frequency map of [formula] are of the form

[formula]

which is thus non-degenerate in a open subset Ω' of Π symplectically reduced from the [formula]-symmetry for any choice of n,n', with the relative measure of Ω' in Ω tends to 1 when α  →  0, in which [formula] is defined analogously in the system [formula] as [formula] in Fquad. At the expense of restricting Ω' a little bit, we may further suppose that the transformation φnψn' is well-defined. We fix α such that the set Ω' has sufficiently large measure in Ω.

In Ω', there exist  > 0,  ≥  3, such that the set of (α3,)-Diophantine invariant Lagrangian tori of [formula] form a positive measure set whose measure is uniformly bounded for small α (Example-Condition [\ref=isochron_nondeg]). By definition of Ω', near such a torus with action variables [formula], there exists a λ-neighborhood for some λ  >  0, such that the torsions of the Lagrangian tori of [formula] do not vanish in this neighborhood. Let

[formula]

Thus for any [formula], and for any choice of n,n', the frequency map of the Lagrangian torus of [formula] corresponding to [formula] is non-degenerate. The existence of λ follows from the definition of Ω'.

We may now apply Corollary [\ref=cor:_isochron_nondeg] for Lagrangian tori (i.e. p = 4,q = 0) near the torus of [formula] with action variables [formula]. We take [formula] (See Section [\ref=SecularAndSecularIntegrableSystems] for definition of ψn and φn'), [formula], with parameter [formula] and perturbation [formula], whose order of smallness with respect to α can be made arbitrarily high by choosing large enough integers n and n'. In particular, we may choose large enough n and n' so that Corollary [\ref=cor:_isochron_nondeg] is applicable.

The existence of an invariant Lagrangian torus of [formula] (and thus of F) close to the Lagrangian torus of [formula] with action variables [formula] thus follows. We apply Corollary [\ref=cor:_isochron_nondeg] near other (α3,)-Diophantine invariant Lagrangian tori of [formula] in Ω' analogously.

In such a way, we get a set of positive measure of Lagrangian tori in the perturbed system [formula] (and thus of F) for any fixed C  >  0. It remains to show that most of these Lagrangian tori stay away from the collisions. The transformations we have used to build the secular and secular-integrable systems are of order O(α), which shall bring an O(α)-deformation to the collision set. Therefore, for fixed C and G2 (independent of α), most of these invariant Lagrangian tori stay away from the collision set, provided α is small enough.

By rotation around [formula], we obtain a positive measure of 5-dimensional invariant tori in the lunar spatial three-body problem.

We establish the following types of quasi-periodic motions in the spatial lunar three-body problem (the required non-degeneracy conditions are collected in Appendix [\ref=non-degeneracySecularFrequencyMap]):

Motions along which g1 librate around [formula], corresponds to the phase portraits around the elliptical singularity B;

Motions along which G1 remains large (eventually near {G1 = G1, max}) while g1 decreases;

Motions along which G1 remains large (eventually near {G1 = G1, max}) while g1 increases;

Motions along which G1 remains small but bounded from zero, while g1 increases.

From Theorem [\ref=Poeschel], we get

Let us now consider the elliptic isotropic tori corresponding to the elliptic singularity B. Set p = 3,q = 1. The frequency of an elliptical isotropic torus with parameters (L1,L2,G2,C) corresponding to the only elliptic quadrupolar singularity B in Figure [\ref=Fig:_quadrupolar_Phase_LZ] is of the form

[formula]

in which νquadn,G2 denotes the quadrupolar normal frequency of the elliptical isotropic torus. We show in Appendix [\ref=non-degeneracySecularFrequencyMap] that the quadrupolar frequency map

[formula]

is non-degenerate for almost all [formula]. Set C = C0  +  λCλ. We may now apply Corollary [\ref=cor:_isochron_nondeg] in the same way as for Lagrangian tori, with parameters Lλ1,Lλ2,Gλ2,Cλ to obtain a positive 4-dimensional Lebesgue measure set of 3-dimensional isotropic elliptic tori in the direct product of the phase space of the reduced system of the spatial three-body problem (by the SO(3)-symmetry) with the space of parameters C. Let us call this 4-dimensional Lebesgue measure a "product measure".

Estimates of the Perturbing Functions

We first recall some hypothesis and notations from the beginning of Section [\ref=SecularAndSecularIntegrableSystems]:

the masses m0,m1,m2 are fixed arbitrarily;

Let [formula] be positive numbers. We assume that

[formula]

Let [formula] be two positive real numbers. We assume that

[formula]

[formula]

From the relations

[formula]

we obtain in particular that [formula] for σ̂  =   max {σ0,σ1}.

(Lemma 1.1 in [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar]) The expansion

[formula]

is convergent in [formula] (and therefore when [formula]) where Pn is the n-th Legendre polynomial, ζ is the angle between the two vectors Q1 and Q2, σ̂  =   max {σ0,σ1} and σn  =  σn - 10 + ( - 1)nσn - 11.

As in [\cite=QuasiMotionPlanar], we have:

[formula]

for some constant Cst only depending on [formula].

Since ([\cite=Kellogg])

[formula]

and

[formula]

we have

[formula]

The conclusion thus follows when [formula]. In particular, the constant Cst is uniform in the region of the phase space given by the hypothesis in the beginning of this appendix.

In the following lemma, we regard Fpert as a function of Delaunay variables

[formula]

in which P* is defined, with the hypothesis of this appendix, by further asking that all the Delaunay variables are well defined. All variables are considered as complex, thus P* is a subset of [formula]. The modulus of a complex number is denoted by |  ·  | .

There exists a positive number s > 0, such that [formula] in the s-neighborhood TP*,s of P* for some constant Cst independent of α.

By continuity, there exists a positive number s, such that in TP*,s, we have uniformly

[formula]

in which cos ζ, [formula] and [formula] are considered as the corresponding analytically extensions of the original functions.

Using Bonnet's recursion formula of Legendre polynomials

[formula]

by induction on n, we obtain |Pn( cos ζ)|  ≤  5n.

Thus

[formula]

It is then sufficient to impose [formula] and s small enough to ensure that [formula].

Singularities in the Quadrupolar System

In this appendix, we show that, for a dense open set of values of parameters (G2,C,L1,L2), the singularities A,B,A',E of Fquad(G1,g1;G2,C,L1,L2) are of Morse type in the (G1,g1)-space.

Following [\cite=LidovZiglin], we define the normalized variables

[formula]

From section [\ref=QuadrupolarDynamics], we deduce

[formula]

in which

[formula]

The coefficient k is independent of [formula] and [formula] and [formula]. We shall work with W from now on.

For a dense open set of values of the parameters [formula] with [formula], all the singularities of the 1-degree of freedom Hamiltonian W (seen as a function of [formula]) are of Morse type.

A singularity is of Morse type if, by definition, the Hessian of W at this point is non-degenerate. By evaluating the determinant of the Hessian of W with respect to [formula] at the corresponding singularity, we get an analytic function of [formula], hence we only need to show that this function is not identically zero. Some of the following results were assisted by Maple 16.

Singularity A: The determinant of the Hessian of W at this point is

[formula]

Singularities B and A': The squares [formula] of the ordinates [formula] of B and A' are both determined by the same cubic equation

[formula]

In order to make the analysis simple, we set the ordinate of B to [formula] and the ordinate of A' to [formula]. This leads to

[formula]

which are in the allowable range of values (see Condition (3), Section [\ref=QuadrupolarDynamics]).

The determinants of the Hessian of W at [formula] and [formula] are respectively [formula] and [formula].

Singularity E([formula]): at [formula], the determinant of the Hessian of W at this point is [formula].

Singularity E([formula]): the determinant of the Hessian of W at this point is

[formula]

In coordinates (G1,g1), the circle {G1 = G1, min} corresponds to coplanar motions, and is therefore invariant under any system [formula]. There are no other singularities near {G1 = G1, min}. Therefore, locally near {G1 = G1, min} in the 2-dimensional reduced secular space, the flow of [formula] is orbitally conjugate to Fquad.

Non-degeneracy of the Quadrupolar Frequency Maps

In this appendix, we verify the non-degeneracy of the frequency maps for the quadrupolar system Fquad(G1,g1,G2;C,L1,L2) reduced by the [formula]-symmetry (but keep the [formula]-symmetry conjugate to G2 unreduced). The calculations is assisted by Maple 16.

We continue to work in the normalized coordinates of [\cite=LidovZiglin], described at the beginning of Appendix [\ref=MorseSingularities], i.e.

[formula]

In these coordinates, we have [formula], and

[formula]

Let [formula]. This function is now considered as a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian defined on the 4-dimensional phase space, whose coordinates are [formula], depending on the parameter [formula]. We shall formulate our results in terms of [formula], from which the corresponding results for Fquad follow directly.

The main idea in the forthcoming proofs is to deduce the existence of torsion of [formula] from a local approximation system [formula] whose flow, for fixed [formula], is linear in the [formula]-plane. By analyticity, the torsion of [formula] is then non-zero almost everywhere in the corresponding region of the phase space foliated by the continuous family of the Lagrangian tori.

To obtain the approximating system [formula], we consider the reduced system [formula] of [formula] by fixing [formula] and reduced by the [formula]-action conjugate to [formula]. We either develop [formula] into Taylor series of [formula] at an elliptic singularity and truncate at the second order, or develop [formula] into Taylor series of [formula] at [formula] and truncate at the first order. In both cases, the torsion of the truncated system amounts to the non-trivial dependence of a certain function of the coefficients of the truncation with respect to [formula].

For a dense open set of values of [formula], the frequency mapping of the Lagrangian tori of [formula] is non-degenerate on a dense open subset of the phase space of [formula].

By analyticity of the system, we just have to verify the non-degeneracy in small neighborhoods of the singularity B and [formula] or [formula] for the system [formula].

In a small neighborhood of B (whose [formula]-coordinate is denoted by [formula]), let [formula], [formula]. We develop [formula] into Taylor series of [formula] and [formula]:

[formula]

In which

[formula]

From Equation [\ref=Eq:_cubic_B], we see that [formula]. To show that [formula], we just need to use the identity (deduced from Equation [\ref=Eq:_cubic_B])

[formula]

to write [formula] into the form

[formula]

Since the singularity B is elliptic, we have [formula] for a dense open set of [formula]. For f close to [formula] when Ξ > 0 (resp. Ξ  <  0), the equation [formula] defines an ellipse in the [formula]-plane which bounds an area [formula], thus we may set [formula], which is an action variable for the truncating system of [formula] up to second order of [formula] and [formula]. Therefore [formula], where [formula] is a certain function of [formula] and [formula], which goes to zero not slower than [formula].

We denote by [formula] the torsion of [formula] i.e. the absolute value of the determinant of the Hessian matrix of a function [formula], i.e.

[formula]

It is direct to verify that

[formula]

which is of at least the same order of smallness comparing to the quantity f - Φ, which can be made arbitrarily small when restricted to small enough neighborhood of B, and

[formula]

This is exactly the torsion of the system [formula] considered as a system of two degrees of freedom with coordinates [formula].

Therefore in order to prove the statement, it is enough to show that [formula] for some [formula] and [formula].

Suppose on the contrary that the function [formula] is independent of [formula], then the function ΞΥ is also independent of [formula]. In view of the expressions of Ξ and Υ, this can happen only if one of the following expressions is a non-zero multiple of [formula] for some integer [formula]:

[formula]

Since [formula] solves Equation [\ref=Eq:_cubic_B], we substitute the particular form of [formula] obtained in each case in Equation [\ref=Eq:_cubic_B], thus exclude the first two by comparing the constant term, exclude the third by comparing the lowest order term of [formula], and exclude the last two by comparing the terms that only depends on [formula]. As a result, [formula] is non-zero for a dense open set of values of (α,β).

We now consider the torsion of the tori near the lower boundary [formula].

Recall that the function [formula] and the coordinates [formula] extend analytically to [formula]. This enables us to develop [formula] into Taylor series with respect to [formula] at [formula]: set [formula], we obtain

[formula]

in which

[formula]

We eliminate the dependence of [formula] in the linearized Hamiltonian [formula] by computing action-angle coordinates. The value of the action variable [formula] on the level curve

[formula]

is computed from the area between this curve and [formula], that is

[formula]

We have then

[formula]

As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=Appendix_C] [\ref=lem_1], for [formula] small enough, the torsion of [formula] is dominated by the torsion of the term linear in [formula], which is

[formula]

Using the formula

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

which depends non-trivially on [formula]. Therefore the torsion of the system

[formula]

which is considered as a function of [formula], is not identically zero.

In the case [formula], since [formula] is an odd function of [formula], we may simply replace [formula] by [formula] in the formula for tori near [formula] presented above. The required non-degeneracy follows directly.

In the case [formula], by the same method, we only have to notice that the function

[formula]

depends non-trivially on [formula].

The frequency map of the elliptic isotropic tori corresponding to the secular singularity B is non-degenerate for a dense open set of values of [formula].

Following from the previous proof, we only need to note in addition that the secular frequency map of the elliptic isotopic tori corresponding to the secular singularity B is the limit of the secular frequency map of the Lagrangian tori around B: At the limit, the frequency of these tori with respect to [formula] becomes the normal frequency of the lower dimensional secular tori corresponds to B, and the frequency with respect to G2 becomes the tangential frequency of the lower dimensional tori. We see that the frequency of the approximating Hamiltonian [formula] is independent of [formula], hence its frequency map for Lagrangian tori near the lower dimensional tori gives in the same time the frequency map for the lower dimensional tori. By the same reasoning and calculations as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=Appendix_C] [\ref=lem_1], the non-degeneracy condition of the secular frequency holds for a dense open set in the [formula]-space.
