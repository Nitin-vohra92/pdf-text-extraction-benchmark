A Note on Sparsification by Frames

Let [formula] and [formula] be a signal such that

[formula]

with [formula]. In compressed sensing, one can find a good stable approximation (in terms of ε and the tail of β consisting of p - k smallest entries) of β from the measurement matrix Φ and the measurement y through solving an [formula]-minimization, provided that Φ belongs to a family of well behaved matrices. A subclass of this family of matrices can be characterized by the well known restrictive isometry property (RIP) of Candès, Romberg, and Tao, [\cite=CRT] [\cite=CanTao05]. This property requires the following relation for Φ

[formula]

for every k-sparse vector c (namely, c has at most k nonzero components), for some small constant δk. Some bounds on δ have been determined, e.g., [\cite=CRT] [\cite=CanTao05] [\cite=CWX] [\cite=Candes]. Cai and Zhang recently have established several sharp RIP bounds that cover the most interesting cases of δk and δ2k [\cite=CZ] [\cite=CZ1], showing [formula].

The requirement of a signal being sparse or approximately sparse is a key in this setting. Many families of integrating signals indeed have sparse representations under suitable bases. Recently an interesting sparsifying scheme was proposed by Candes, Eldar, Needel, and Randall [\cite=CanDRIP]. In their scheme, instead of bases, tight frames are used to sparsify signals.

Let [formula] (d  ≥  p) be a tight frame and k  ≤  d. [\cite=CanDRIP] suggests that one use the following optimization to approximate the signal β:

[formula]

The traditional RIP is no longer effective in the generalized setting. Candes, Eldar, Needel, and Randall defined the D-restricted isometry property which extends RIP [\cite=CanDRIP]. Here we shall use the formulation of D-RIP in [\cite=LLY]

The measurement matrix Φ obeys the D-RIP with constant δk if

[formula]

holds for all k-sparse vector [formula].

[\cite=CanDRIP] [\cite=LLY] have determined some bound for the D-RIP constant δ2k. The purpose of this note is to remark, using the clever ideas of Cai and Zhang [\cite=CZ1], that one can get an improved bound for D-RIP constant δ2k without much difficulty.

Let D be an arbitrary tight frame and let Φ be a measurement matrix satisfying D-RIP with [formula]. Then the solution [formula] to ([\ref=eq:1.1]) satisfies

[formula]

where C0,C1 are constants that depend on δ2k, (D*β)max (k) is the vector D*β with all but the k largest components (in magnitude) set to zero.

Before proving this theorem, let us make some remarks. Firstly, Cai and Zhang have obtained a sharp bound [formula] for the case D = I in [\cite=CZ1], it is interesting to know whether the bound of this note can be further improved. Secondly, following the ideas of [\cite=CZ] [\cite=CZ1], more general results (other D-RIP bounds) can be obtained in parallel.

We need the following [formula]-norm invariant convex k-sparse decomposition of Xu and Xu [\cite=XuXu], and Cai and Zhang [\cite=CZ1] in our proof of theorem [\ref=thm:1.1]. We shall take the description from [\cite=XuXu].

For positive integers k  ≤  n, and positive constant C, let [formula] be a vector with [formula] and [formula]. Then there are k-sparse vectors [formula] with

[formula]

such that

[formula]

for some nonnegative real numbers [formula] with [formula].

Now let us proceed to the proof of theorem [\ref=thm:1.1].

In this proof we follow the ideas in the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 2.1 of [\cite=CZ1], incorporating some more simplified steps. We also use some strategies from [\cite=CWX] [\cite=CXZ]. We only deal with the δ2k case so that the key ideas can be conveyed clearly.

Let h =   -  β.

For a subset [formula], we will denote by DS the matrix D restricted to the columns indexed by S (and replacing other columns by zero vectors). Let Ω denote the index set of the largest k components of D*β (in magnitude), i.e., (D*β)max (k) = D*Ωβ. With this notation we have D*ΩCβ  =  D*β - (D*β)max (k). As in [\cite=CanDRIP], one can easily verify

[formula];

[formula].

Denote vi  =  〈Di,h〉 for [formula], where Di is the i-th column of D, then

[formula]

By rearranging the columns of D if necessary, we may assume [formula]. Let [formula]. In this case, we have

[formula]

We assume that the tight frame D is normalized, i.e., DD*  =  I and [formula] for all [formula]. Thus we have the following useful relation:

[formula]

From the facts [formula] and [formula], the relation [formula] yields

[formula]

Since [formula], we can use lemma [\ref=lem:1.1] to get the following [formula]-invariant convex k-sparse decomposition of D*TCh which is the key ingredient of the proof:

[formula]

with each [formula] being k-sparse, [formula] and [formula]. From this and the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we have immediately

[formula]

By triangle inequality, [formula] holds and ([\ref=eq:1.7]) implies

[formula]

Note that [formula] and D*β - (D*β)max (k) = D*ΩCβ. In order to prove the theorem, it suffices to show that there are constants C0',C1' such that

[formula]

In fact, assuming ([\ref=eq:1.9]) we get

[formula]

Now let us prove ([\ref=eq:1.9]). Denote

[formula]

First, as D*Th is k-sparse, hence 2k-sparse. we have and δk  ≤  δ2k, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, as each D*Th + wt is 2k-sparse, by following an approach similar to that in [\cite=CZ1] [\cite=XuXu] we have Combining this with ([\ref=eq:1.10]) we see that

[formula]

By making perfect square, we have which implies that Finally we get ([\ref=eq:1.9]):

[formula]
