An Example of a Right Loop Admitting Only Discrete Topolization

Key words: Right loop, Normalized Right Transversal.

Introduction

A groupoid [formula] is called a right loop (resp. left loop) if

for all x,y∈S, the equation [formula] (resp. [formula]) , where X is unknown in the equation, has a unique solution in S. In notation we write it as X = y / x (resp. [formula])

if there exists 1∈S such that [formula] for all x∈S.

Let [formula] be a right loop (resp. left loop). For u∈S the map [formula] (resp. [formula]) defined by [formula] (resp. [formula]) is a bijection on S. We will drop the superscript, if the binary operation is clear.

A groupoid [formula] is called a loop if it is right loop as well as left loop. A loop S is said to be commutative if [formula] for all x,y∈S.

A loop S is said to be inverse property loop (I.P. loop) if for each x∈S there exists x- 1∈S such that [formula] and [formula] for all y∈S.

Let G be a group and H be a subgroup of G. A normalized right transversal (NRT) S of H in G is a subset of G obtained by choosing one and only one element from each right coset of H in G and 1∈S. Then S has a induced binary operation [formula] given by [formula], with respect to which S is a right loop with identity 1, (see [\cite=smth],[\cite=rltr]). Conversely, every right loop can be embedded as an NRT in a group with some universal property (see [\cite=rltr]).

Let T(G,H) denote the set of all NRTs of H in G. Let S∈T(G,H) and [formula] be the induced binary operation on S. Let x,y∈S and h∈H. Then [formula] for some f(x,y)∈H and [formula]. Also x.h = σx(h)xθh for some σx(h)∈H and xθh∈S. This gives us a map f:S  ×  S  →  H and a map σ:S  →  HH defined by f((x,y)) = f(x,y) and σ(x)(h) = σx(h). Also θ is a right action of H on S. The quadruple (S,H,σ,f) is a c-groupoid (see [\cite=rltr]). Infact, every c-groupoid comes in this way (see [\cite=rltr]). The same is observed in [\cite=km] but with different notations (see [\cite=km]).

A right loop [formula] is said to be topological right loop if S is a topological space and the operations [formula] and /   are continuous.

Let x,y∈S. Then the map [formula] from S to S takes x to y.

Let [formula] be a topological right loop. Then

the topological right loop S is homogeneous. For any x,y∈S, the map [formula] is a homeomorphism sending x to y.

every T1 topological right loop is Hausdorff Note that the map f:S  ×  S  →  S defined by f(x,y) = x / y is countinuous, where x,y∈S. Then Δ  =  {(x,x)|x∈S} = f- 1(1) is a closed subset of S  ×  S.

From now onwards, we will assume that our topological right loop is T1.

An Example of a Right Loop Admitting Only Discrete Topolization

Let [formula] be a loop. Let e denote the identity of the loop U. Let [formula] and η∈Sym(U) such that η(e) = e. Define an operation [formula] on the set U as

[formula]

It can be checked that [formula] is a right loop. Let us denote this right loop as UBη. If [formula], then UBη is the loop U itself. If η is fixed, then we will drop the subscript η. It can be checked that if y∉B, then [formula] and if y∈B, then [formula].

In following example, we will observe that right loop structure on each NRTs in infinite dihedral group of non-normal subgroup of order 2 can be obtained in the manner defined in the equation ([\ref=ex1]).

Let [formula], the infinite cyclic group. Define a map [formula] by η(i) =  - i, where [formula]. Note that η is a bijection on [formula]. Let [formula]. We denote [formula] by [formula].

Let G = D∞  =  〈x,y|x2 = 1,xyx = y- 1〉 and H = {1,x}. Let N = 〈y〉. Let ε:N  →  H be a function with ε(1) = 1. Then Tε  =  {ε(yi)yi|1  ≤  i  ≤  n}∈T(G,H) and all NRTs T∈T(G,H) are of this form. Let [formula]. Since ε is completely determined by the subset B, we shall denote Tε by TB. Clearly, the map ε(yi)yi  ↦  i from Tε to [formula] is an isomorphism of right loops. So we may identify the right loop TB with the right loop [formula] by means of the above isomorphism. We observe that [formula].

Let G be a group and H a subgroup of G. Let S∈T(G,H) such that S is an I.P. loop with respect to the induced binary operation on it. Then L- 11 / a = La.

By [\cite=km], [formula], where [formula] denote the left inverse of u∈S. Let x∈S and [formula] [formula] [formula].

By [\cite=km], [formula]. Also, since S is I.P. loop, [formula]. Then above equation becomes [formula]. This shows that L- 11 / a = La.

Following, we will give an example of a right loop where only discrete topolization is possible:

Let G1 be a countable group with relation x2 = e, where e is the identity of G1 and G2 be a finite group with identity 1 on which two distinct involutive automorphism φ and ψ exists. Fix two distinct elements a,b∈G1. Let [formula] be commutative I.P. loop as in [\cite=nms].

Let B = {(e,1) / (a,1),(b,1)}. Let η∈Sym(L) such that η(e,1) = (e,1). Define a binary operation [formula] on L as defined in the equation ([\ref=ex1]). Consider a topology on L so that L is a topological right loop. Then the map [formula] is a homeomorphism. One can note that [formula] (by Lemma [\ref=l1]).

Also note that α is same as given in [\cite=nms]. This α moves only finitely many points. Therefore, the right loop [formula] can not be topolized in non-discrete manner.

Let S be a right loop. Then the group generated by Ra for all a∈S is called as the right multiplication group of S. At the end, we ask following question:

Question: Let S be a right loop admitting only discrete topology. What topology can the right multiplication group of S can have?
