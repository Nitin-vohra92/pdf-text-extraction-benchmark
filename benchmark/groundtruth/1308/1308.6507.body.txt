Riesz transforms on compact Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank one

Introduction

Let M be a Riemannian symmetric space of rank one and compact type. The Laplace-Beltrami operator M on M is given by [formula], where [formula] and [formula] are the Riemannian gradient and divergence, respectively. Suppose now that u is a solution to the nonlocal problem

[formula]

where ( - ΔM)1 / 2 is the square root of -  ΔM =  - M  +  λM, and λM is a positive constant depending on M (see [\eqref=lambdas] below). The operator ( - ΔM)1 / 2 can be thought as a first order (nonlocal) differential operator. Thus, when f is in some functional space X we may expect the gradient of u to be in the same space X, that is,

[formula]

The operator

[formula]

is the Riesz transform on M. The consideration above would say that the Riesz transform is a bounded operator from X to X. In this paper we choose as X the mixed norm spaces Lp(L2(M)) that are defined in terms of polar coordinates on M. Here is our main result.

Let M be a compact Riemannian symmetric space of rank one. Then the Riesz transform RM is a bounded operator from Lp(L2(M)) into itself, for all 1 < p <   ∞  .

It is known that the Riesz transforms based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator [formula] are bounded in Lp(M), 1 < p <   ∞  , even if M is of non-compact type, see [\cite=Strichartz]. Nothing had been done so far for singular integrals in the mixed norm context. In this regard, Theorem [\ref=Thm:Riesz_Riemannian] is completely original. Moreover, the ideas and techniques developed here open the way to the study of many important singular integral operators related to the Laplace-Beltrami operator in mixed norm spaces, like maximal operators, higher order Riesz transforms and Littlewood-Paley square functions. Applications to Sobolev spaces on M and further development of the theory will appear elsewhere.

H.-C. Wang showed in [\cite=Wang] that there are just five examples of M: the sphere, the real, complex and quaternionic projective spaces and the Cayley plane. Each of these manifolds admit appropriate polar coordinates [formula], where [formula] is a unit sphere whose dimension depends on M. This allows us to define the mixed norm spaces Lp(L2(M)), see [\cite=Ciaurri-Roncal-Stinga]. It turns out that in these coordinates,

[formula]

where, for given parameters α,β >  - 1 that depend on M, Jα,β is the trigonometric Jacobi polynomials differential operator (see [\eqref=eq:ecDiferencial_Jacobi]) and ρM(θ) is an explicit nonnegative function of θ. Thus the eigenspaces Hn(M) of -  ΔM can eventually be written in terms of products of spherical harmonics and trigonometric Jacobi polynomials whose type parameters depend on j, where j varies in a range depending on n and the dimension of M. Moreover, because of such an underlying structure, the Riesz transform on M in the spaces Lp(L2(M)) is related to the Jacobi-Riesz transform

[formula]

and an operator given by a negative power of the Jacobi operator [formula], see Section [\ref=Section:Riemannian] for more details. Now the key point of the paper is to exploit these connections. Roughly speaking, because of the structure of the operators and the estimates we are looking for, we need suitable weighted vector-valued extensions for the operators Rα,β and Tα,βM. These are contained in Theorems [\ref=Cor:Lp] and [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular]. We achieve both extensions with a clever use of a suitable adaptation of the extrapolation theorem by Rubio de Francia, see Theorem [\ref=th:extra-RF]. In order to apply such an extrapolation result, we need to prove that Rα,β and Tα,βM are Calderón-Zygmund operators in the sense of suitable spaces of homogeneous type, and show appropriate estimates for the corresponding kernels, see Theorems [\ref=Thm:Jacobi-Riesz_kernel] and [\ref=Angular_Riesz_kernel]. In this way, by the general theory, they will satisfy weighted inequalities. But we have to be careful in the estimates for the kernels, since they need to be uniform on the parameters α,β. These estimates are sharper than previous ones already obtained in the Jacobi context (see [\cite=Ciaurri-Roncal-Stinga] [\cite=Nowak-Sjogren_Calderon]) and of independent interest.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=Section:Riemannian] we present the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:Riesz_Riemannian] under the assumption that Theorems [\ref=Cor:Lp] and [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular] are true. Then the rest of the paper is devoted to complete the proof of the vector-valued extensions. Section [\ref=proofs_vector-valued] contains the adaptation of Rubio de Francia's extrapolation theorem and also shows how to use it to derive Theorems [\ref=Cor:Lp] and [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular]. In Section [\ref=Section:Kernels] we prove the kernel estimates for Rα,β and Tα,βM. Since in this last section we must get uniform estimates on α and β, the computations become rather cumbersome, so we will try to keep them to a minimum.

The Riesz transform on M

In this section we give the precise definitions of the mixed norm spaces Lp(L2(M)) and the Riesz transform RM. We will also prove Theorem [\ref=Thm:Riesz_Riemannian] (case by case) by using Theorems [\ref=Cor:Lp] and [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular].

As we said above, the manifolds M we are considering here are completely classified as

the sphere [formula], [formula];

the real projective space [formula], [formula];

the complex projective space [formula], [formula];

the quaternionic projective space [formula], [formula];

the Cayley plane [formula].

We take (see [\cite=Ciaurri-Roncal-Stinga] [\cite=Sherman])

[formula]

Here d = 2,4,8, m = l - 2,2l - 3,3, for [formula], [formula] and [formula], respectively. Besides, we will assume that [formula] in the case of [formula].

Preliminaries on Jacobi expansions

In this subsection we quickly introduce some necessary facts about Jacobi expansions and the definitions of the related operators that will arise in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:Riesz_Riemannian].

The standard Jacobi polynomials of degree [formula] and type α,β >  - 1 are given by

[formula]

see [\cite=Szego]. These form an orthogonal basis of [formula]. After making the change of variable x =  cos θ, we obtain the normalized Jacobi trigonometric polynomials

[formula]

where the normalizing factor is

[formula]

The trigonometric polynomials P(α,β)n are eigenfunctions of the Jacobi differential operator

[formula]

Indeed, we have Jα,βP(α,β)n  =  λα,βnP(α,β)n, with eigenvalue [formula]. Moreover, the system [formula] forms a complete orthonormal basis of L2(dμα,β): = L2((0,π),dμα,β(θ)), with

[formula]

For further information about Jacobi polynomials see [\cite=Szego].

Jacobi-Riesz transforms

We have the decomposition

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] is its formal adjoint in L2(dμα,β), that is, [formula]. The Jacobi-Riesz transform is formally defined as Rα,β: = δ(Jα,β)- 1 / 2. For a function f∈L2(dμα,β) we can write [formula] in L2(dμα,β). Then

[formula]

The operator Tα,βM

Here we define Tα,βM as in the introduction by taking

[formula]

For f∈L2(dμα,β),

[formula]

The case of the unit sphere [formula]

Let [formula] be the unit sphere in [formula], [formula]. We set [formula], see [\eqref=lambdas]. It is well-known that [formula], where [formula] is the set of spherical harmonics of degree n in d + 1 variables, see [\cite=BGM]. Each [formula] is an eigenspace of [formula] with eigenvalue - n(n + d - 1). Hence, [formula].

We introduce the following coordinates on [formula], known as geodesic polar coordinates. Each point on the sphere can be written as

[formula]

for θ∈[0,π] and [formula] (see [\cite=Chavel], also [\cite=Sherman] after the change t =  cos θ). For a function f on [formula] let us write [formula]. We have, see [\cite=BGM],

[formula]

By using the coordinates in [\eqref=geodesicas], we can see that

[formula]

where [formula] is the spherical part of the Laplacian on [formula], acting on functions on [formula] by holding the first coordinate fixed and differentiating with respect to the remaining variables, see [\cite=Chavel_Eigenvalues]. In [\eqref=laplaciano_polares] we have chosen [formula] for the operator Jα,α of [\eqref=eq:ecDiferencial_Jacobi].

By using the description of [formula] via spherical harmonics and the coordinates in [\eqref=geodesicas], it is an exercise to see that an orthonormal basis associated to [\eqref=laplaciano_polares] is given by

[formula]

See also [\cite=Sherman]. Here, for [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

where is an ultraspherical polynomial, see [\cite=Szego], and an,j is the normalizing constant

[formula]

with dα,βn as in [\eqref=que]. The functions Ydj,k, [formula], where [formula], form an orthonormal basis of spherical harmonics on [formula] of degree [formula]. The orthogonal projections of f onto the spaces [formula] can be written in coordinates as

[formula]

We define the mixed norm space [formula], 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , as the set of functions f on [formula] such that

[formula]

The spaces [formula] are Banach spaces under this norm.

The Riesz transform on the mixed norm space [formula] are defined in the following way. Let

[formula]

(note the abuse of notation in [\eqref=definicion_integral_fraccionaria]) for [formula]. Next, notice that [formula], with

[formula]

and

[formula]

the formal adjoint of [formula] in [formula]. Observe now that, since [formula] is compact, by [\cite=BGM], and [\eqref=psi],

[formula]

with [formula] as above, where in the last equality we used the orthogonality property [formula]. Hence, in the coordinates, [formula]. Therefore, by [\eqref=definicion_integral_fraccionaria], in the coordinates we have

[formula]

By projecting F on the space of spherical harmonics, we can write

[formula]

where

[formula]

With this,

[formula]

By applying [\eqref=geografia] and the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics Ydj,k, we can write

[formula]

By using [\eqref=definicion_integral_fraccionaria], [\eqref=proyecciones], [\eqref=coeficientes_radiales_theta],

[formula]

Therefore, by [\eqref=Riesz_separada], the Riesz transform can be written as

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and [formula], we have

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=Cor:Lp] and Theorem [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular] with a = b = 1 and w = 1, from [\eqref=norma], we get

[formula]

The case of the real projective space [formula]

To deal with the real projective space we just have to consider even functions on the sphere (as done at the end of Section 2 of [\cite=Sherman] or in [\cite=Ciaurri-Roncal-Stinga], see also [\cite=BGM] or [\cite=Chavel_Eigenvalues]). More precisely, a function defined on [formula] can be identified with an even function on [formula]. Indeed, the antipodal map s  ↦    ±  s from [formula] to [formula] is a Riemannian covering. The spherical harmonics in [formula] satisfy Yd + 1n,j( - x) = ( - 1)nYd + 1n,j(x). Then the space [formula] of even functions in [formula] can be decomposed as [formula]. Hence, a function on [formula] is written as

[formula]

Thus, Theorem [\ref=Thm:Riesz_Riemannian] for [formula] is then established as a particular case of the result for the sphere applied to even functions.

The case of the projective spaces [formula], [formula] and [formula]

In this subsection we use the tools developed in [\cite=Sherman]. Let M be any of the projective spaces [formula], [formula] or [formula] and take -  ΔM as in the introduction, with λM as in [\eqref=lambdas]. We have the orthogonal direct sum decomposition [formula]. Each space Hn(M) is finite-dimensional and corresponds to the eigenspace of M with respect to the eigenvalue - n(n + m + d). From here it is readily seen that [formula].

Now we introduce appropriate polar coordinates on M by following [\cite=Sherman]. Let [formula] be the unit ball in [formula] and ω(r): = cωr- 1(1 - r)m, for 0 < r < 1, with [formula]. According to [\cite=Sherman] there is a bounded linear map [formula] such that for every f∈L1(M),

[formula]

where dμM is the Riemannian measure on M. Each [formula], [formula], can be written in polar coordinates as x = rx', where 0 < r = |x| < 1 and [formula]. Then, if we write [formula] for 0 < θ  <  π and F(θ,x') = E(f)(rx') we have that integration over M reduces to

[formula]

Let [formula] be the space of functions on [formula] which are polynomials of degree less than or equal to n in the variables x and r = |x|. Define the set [formula] as the orthocompliment of the space [formula] in [formula] with respect to the inner product on [formula]. It is shown in [\cite=Sherman] that [formula]. With polar coordinates and the trigonometric change as above, the eigenspaces [formula]. These spaces are eigenspaces of the differential operator

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula], see [\cite=Sherman]. The corresponding eigenvalues are [formula], see [\cite=Sherman]. In this way it is possible to write [formula]. A basis of the latter spaces is

[formula]

where, for P(α,β)n as in [\eqref=eq1],

[formula]

and the set {Yd + 1j,k}1  ≤  k  ≤  d(j) is an orthonormal basis of the space of spherical harmonics of degree j, and [formula]. By virtue of [\eqref=trig_pol] and [\eqref=que] the normalizing constant is

[formula]

Thus, the projections can be written in these coordinates as

[formula]

The mixed norm spaces Lp(L2(M)), 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , are defined as the set of functions f on M for which the norm

[formula]

is finite. The spaces Lp(L2(M)) are Banach spaces.

Now we pass to the definition of the Riesz transform on the mixed norm space Lp(L2(M)). By [\eqref=eq44], in the coordinates we let

[formula]

We have -  ΔM  =  δ*MδM  +  λM, with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Analogously to the case of the sphere [formula] in Subsection [\ref=subsection:redonda], we have

[formula]

Therefore, in the coordinates, [formula]. In this way, by [\eqref=int_frac],

[formula]

Parallel to the case of the sphere, we can write

[formula]

with

[formula]

Proceeding as in [\eqref=coeficientes_radiales_theta],

[formula]

Hence, by [\eqref=eq44] and [\eqref=int_frac],

[formula]

From here and [\eqref=Riesz_separada_M], we can write

[formula]

Recall that we are taking α = d - 1,β = m, so we obtain

[formula]

Hence, analogously to the case of the sphere,

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=Cor:Lp] and Theorem [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular] with a = 2, b = 0 and w = 1, by using [\eqref=norma_M],

[formula]

The extrapolation theorem and the vector-valued extensions

In this section we show the adaptation of Rubio de Francia's extrapolation theorem in Theorem [\ref=th:extra-RF] and the weighted vector-valued extensions for the Jacobi-Riesz transforms and the auxiliary operator Tα,βM, collected in Theorems [\ref=Cor:Lp] and [\ref=Thm:Lp_angular].

For 1 < p <   ∞  , we denote by Aα,βp the class of Ap weights on the space of homogeneous type ((0,π),dμα,β(θ),|  ·  |), see [\cite=Calderon]. Namely, Aα,βp is the class of nonnegative functions [formula] for which [formula] and

[formula]

The Jacobi-Hardy-Littlewood maximal function is given by

[formula]

where |I| denotes the length of the interval I  ⊂  (0,π). As a particular case of [\cite=Calderon], we have that Mα,β is bounded in Lp(w  dμα,β) for w∈Aα,βp, 1 < p <   ∞  , and it satisfies a weighted weak-(1,1) estimate (we say that w∈Aα,β1 whenever Mα,βw(θ)  ≤  Cw(θ), dμα,β-a.e.).

Assume that for some family of pairs of nonnegative functions (f,g), for some fixed 1 < r <   ∞   and for all w∈Aα,βr we have

[formula]

with C non depending on the pair (f,g). Then, for all 1 < p <   ∞   and all w∈Aα,βp we have

[formula]

We follow the proof given by J. Duoandikoetxea in [\cite=Duo_Extrapolation]. The main ingredients are the factorization theorem (see [\cite=Duo_Extrapolation]) and the construction of the Rubio de Francia weights Rf and RH (see [\cite=Duo_Extrapolation]) in our context. The first ingredient is available here because of the general factorization theorem proved by Rubio de Francia [\cite=Rubio2]. For the second ingredient we use the operator Mα,β to construct the weights Rf and RH as in Lemma 2.1 of [\cite=Duo_Extrapolation]. Then the proof follows the same lines as in [\cite=Duo_Extrapolation].

Let

[formula]

Let α,β >  - 1 / 2, [formula], b = 0 or [formula], 1 < p,r <   ∞  . Let uj be as in [\eqref=ujs]. Then there is a constant C such that

[formula]

for all fj,k∈Lp(w  dμα,β): = Lp((0,π),w(θ)  dμα,β(θ)) and w∈Aα,βp.

Let α,β >  - 1 / 2, a = 1 or [formula], b = 0 or [formula] and 1 < p,r <   ∞  . Let uj be as in [\eqref=ujs]. When [formula], we also assume that β > 0 and [formula]. Then there exists a constant C such that

[formula]

for all fj,k∈Lp(w  dμα,β) and all w∈Aα,βp.

It will be shown in Section [\ref=Section:Kernels] that the operators above are Calderón-Zygmund operators with associated kernels uj(θ)uj(φ)Kα + aj,β + bj(θ,φ) and juj(θ)uj(φ)Tα + aj,β + bjM(θ,φ). See Section [\ref=Section:Kernels] for the precise definition of both kernels. For them we have the following Calderón-Zygmund estimates, whose proofs can be found in Subsections [\ref=Section:KernelRiesz] and [\ref=Sec:angular].

Let α,β >  - 1 / 2, [formula], b = 0 or [formula], and [formula]. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

with C1 and C2 independent of j, where μα,β(B(θ,|θ  -  φ|)) is the dμα,β-measure of the interval with center θ and radius |θ  -  φ|.

Let α,β >  - 1 / 2, a = 1 or [formula], b = 0 or [formula], [formula] and uj be as in [\eqref=ujs]. Then

[formula]

[formula]

with C1 and C2 independent of j.

Let Sj, [formula], be either the operator ujRα + aj,β + bj(u- 1j  ·  ), or the operator jujTα + aj,β + bjM(u- 1j  ·  ), for α,β >  - 1 / 2. By Theorems [\ref=Thm:Jacobi-Riesz_kernel] and [\ref=Angular_Riesz_kernel] and the Calderón-Zygmund theory for spaces of homogeneous type (see [\cite=Calderon] and [\cite=RT], also [\cite=RRT]), we see that Sj is bounded in Lr(w  dμα,β), for 1 < r <   ∞   and all w∈Aα,βr, uniformly in [formula]. That is, there exists a constant C independent of j such that

[formula]

In particular, for any sequence of functions fj,k in Lr(w  dμα,β), we have

[formula]

for all w∈Aα,βr. Now, in the extrapolation theorem above we make the following choices:

[formula]

With this pair (f,g), the inequality [\eqref=eq:inequality_con_sumas] is just the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=th:extra-RF]. Therefore, for any 1 < p <   ∞   and all w∈Aα,βp,

[formula]

Kernel estimates

Let us consider the Poisson semigroup Pα,βt related to Jα,β. This operator is initially defined in L2(dμα,β) as

[formula]

The operator semigroup {Pα,βt}t > 0 can be written as an integral operator

[formula]

where the Jacobi-Poisson kernel is given by

[formula]

We need a more explicit expression of this kernel when α,β >  - 1 / 2. Let

[formula]

Consider on

[formula]

Kernel estimates for Rα,β

Recall the definition of Jacobi-Riesz transform Rα,β given in Subsection [\ref=definicion_jacobiana] above. Now, see [\cite=Nowak-Sjogren_Calderon], for a compactly supported smooth function f, we have

[formula]

for θ outside the support of f. The kernel is given by

[formula]

Also, Kα,β(θ,φ) satisfies standard Calderón-Zygmund estimates on the space of homogeneous type ((0,π),|  ·  |,dμα,β). Then we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the same way, the operator ujRα + aj,β + bj(u- 1jf)(θ), with uj as in [\eqref=ujs], can be defined by using [\eqref=definicion_obvia] and it can be expressed as an integral operator in the Calderón-Zygmund sense, with associated kernel uj(θ)uj(φ)Kα + aj,β + bj(θ,φ). Let us establish this as a lemma.

Let α,β >  - 1 / 2, [formula] and uj be as in [\eqref=ujs]. Take f,g∈C∞c(0,π) having disjoint supports. Then,

[formula]

The proof of Lemma [\ref=CZ_kernel_associated] follows in a standard way just by writing the left hand side as a Fourier series and checking that it coincides, after changing the order of summation and integration (which can be done because f and g have disjoint supports), with the right hand side.

Now that everything is defined, we are almost ready to prove the sharp growth and smoothness estimates for the kernel uj(θ)uj(φ)Kα + aj,β + bj(θ,φ) stated in Theorem [\ref=Thm:Jacobi-Riesz_kernel].

We will use the following lemma, whose proof can be found, for example, in [\cite=Ciaurri-Roncal].

Let c >  - 1 / 2, 0 < B < A, λ > 0 and [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula]

For α,β >  - 1 / 2 we can readily check that

[formula]

We will often use the following well known fact [\cite=Abra]

[formula]

The next estimate is easy to see. For η > 0 and [formula], we have

[formula]

Finally, we collect several trigonometric identities that will be used throughout the proofs:

[formula]

We have to prove [\eqref=eq:cresimiento] and [\eqref=eq:suavidad] for [formula].

Growth estimates: proof of [\eqref=eq:cresimiento]. By taking into account [\eqref=kernel] and [\eqref=deriv_z], where

Let us proceed with the estimates of each term.

Estimate for J1. Observe that

[formula]

We apply twice Lemma [\ref=lem:0], first in the integral in u, taking [formula] and [formula], and then in the integral in v, taking [formula] and [formula]. We get

[formula]

This and [\eqref=gambas] give [\eqref=eq:cresimiento] for J1.

Estimate for J2. As in the first step to estimate J1, one passes the integration in v from ( - 1,1) to (0,1) and uses that 1 - v2  ≤  2(1 - v) in the numerator. Observe that [formula]. Then, by applying Lemma [\ref=lem:0] to the remaining integral in v with [formula] and [formula] we have that J2 is bounded by

[formula]

Now we make the change of variable 1 + u = 2w, use [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 / 2 and γ  =  α + aj, and apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] taking [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, for [formula], we get

[formula]

The latter estimate and [\eqref=gambas] give [\eqref=eq:cresimiento].

Estimate for J3 when [formula]. Note that [formula]. We follow the same procedure as for J2, but exchanging the role of u and v and the corresponding values for the parameters. Let us explain this. First, by applying Lemma [\ref=lem:0] to the integral in u with [formula] and [formula], J3 is bounded by

[formula]

Next, we make the change of variable 1 + v = 2w, use [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 / 2 and γ  =  β + bj, and apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] taking [formula] and [formula]. We get the estimate, which is similar to that for J2, by exchanging the parameters α and β.

Estimate for J3 when b = 0. Here we proceed with the integral in u as in the previous case, and then observe that the integral appearing in [\eqref=follon] is bounded by the sum of two terms J3, - and J3, +, given by

[formula]

For J3, +, (1 - v)β + 1 / 2  ≤  (1 - v)β, and we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] with [formula] and [formula]. Concerning J3, -, using that [formula], since β - 1 / 2 >  - 1,

[formula]

By plugging the estimates obtained for J1,J2 and J3, and taking into account [\eqref=lem:medida_bolas], we get [\eqref=eq:cresimiento].

Smoothness estimates: proof of [\eqref=eq:suavidad]. Derivative in θ. We have

[formula]

where, for J1,J2 and J3 as above,

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Estimate for K1. We estimate each term K1,i, [formula] separately. The treatment may be tedious and long, but it is systematic. The ideas are the same as in the growth estimates, so we only sketch the hints to follow the proofs.

Indeed, the estimate for K1,1 follows by using first Lemma [\ref=lem:0] to the integral against v with [formula] and [formula]. From here, we proceed with the change 1 + u = 2w, use [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 / 2 and γ  =  α + aj and apply again Lemma [\ref=lem:0] with [formula] and [formula]. We see that the case K1,4 for b  ≥  1 follows analogously as K1,1, but exchanging the roles of u and v, in the same way as it was done with J3. Observe that if b = 0, then K1,4 = 0.

Similarly, for K1,2 we use the same procedure as in K1,1, but using [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 and γ  =  α + aj, and Lemma [\ref=lem:0] with λ = 1 in the second application of the lemma. Again, the case of K1,6 for [formula] is analogous to K1,2, but exchanging the role of the variables u and v.

For K1,5 and [formula] we can follow parallel arguments to the ones for K1,3 in the case [formula] below, by interchanging the roles of u and v.

As for K1,3, we distinguish the two cases.

Estimate for K1,3 when [formula]. For the K1,3 term, we use Lemma [\ref=lem:0] in the integral against u with [formula] and [formula]. Then, we make the change of variable 1 + v = 2w in the integral against v, and use [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 and γ  =  β + bj. Finally, we apply again Lemma [\ref=lem:0] taking [formula] and [formula].

Estimate for K1,3 when b = 0. First, notice that (1 - u2)α + aj - 1 / 2  ≤  (1 - u2)α + aj - 3 / 2 for u∈( - 1,1). Then, we use Lemma [\ref=lem:0] in the integral against u with [formula] and [formula]. After that, the integral arising in v is

[formula]

Proceeding as in the case of J3 above, this integral is bounded by the sum of two terms K1,3, + and K1,3, -, given by

[formula]

For K1,3, +, we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] with [formula] and [formula]. Concerning K1,3, -, by using that [formula], since β - 1 / 2 >  - 1,

[formula]

Estimate for K2. Observe that ∂2θ(1 - z) = z / 4. Then,

[formula]

From here and [\eqref=kernel], we have that

[formula]

where

[formula]

We sketch the proof for each integral containing the term K2,i, [formula].

For the integral with K2,1 we observe that z < 1 and the estimate follows in the same way as for J1 above.

Concerning the integral with K2,2, the proof is analogous to the one for J2, but we take λ  =  β + bj + 5 / 2 in the first application of Lemma [\ref=lem:0] and λ = 2 in the second application.

We pass to K2,3. We apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] in the integral in v with [formula] and [formula], and we make the change of variable 1 + u = 2w in the integral in u. Then, we use [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 and γ  =  α + aj and apply again Lemma [\ref=lem:0] taking [formula] and [formula].

The treatment of K2,4 with [formula] is identical to K2,3, but exchanging the roles of u and v.

Next we estimate K2,4 when b = 0. We use Lemma [\ref=lem:0] in the integral against u with [formula] and [formula]. Observe that the integral arising in v is the same as in [\eqref=int] but with (1 - v)2 in place of (1 - v) in the numerator. This integral is then bounded by K1,3,1 and K1,3,2 above.

The proof of the estimate involving K2,5 is also analogous to the one for J2, but taking λ  =  α + aj + 5 / 2 in the first application of Lemma [\ref=lem:0] and λ = 3 / 2 the second time.

Concerning the integral involving K2,6, the case [formula] works in the same way as K2,5, but exchanging the roles of u and v. For the case b = 0 one uses the procedure given for K2,4, but for the corresponding integral K1,3,2, one needs the estimate

[formula]

For the integral term with K2,7, we first make the change 1 + u = 2w and use [\eqref=function_h] with η = 1 / 2 and γ  =  α + aj. Then, apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] taking [formula] and [formula]. Later on, we distinguish two cases. If [formula] we proceed in the same way with the integral in v, that is, first make the change 1 + v = 2w, then use [\eqref=function_h] and finally apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] with [formula] and [formula]. If b = 0, the integral arising in v is bounded by the sum of the following two integrals:

[formula]

For the integral K2,7, +, observe that (1 - v)β + 1 / 2  ≤  (1 - v)β, and we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] with [formula] and [formula]. For K2,7, - we have

[formula]

By pasting together all the estimates and taking into account [\eqref=lem:medida_bolas], we get [\eqref=eq:suavidad].

Smoothness estimates: proof of [\eqref=eq:suavidad]. Derivative in φ. We have

[formula]

where with J1,J2 and J3 as above, and

[formula]

In order to treat L1, we use the symmetry of the expressions on u and v and θ and φ, and the estimate [\eqref=eq:suavidad] follows with analogous reasonings as for K1 above. Concerning L2, we have to take into account that [formula] and, on the other hand, that [formula]. Then, with the same ideas as in K2, the proof of the estimate [\eqref=eq:suavidad] follows. We leave details to the interested reader.

Kernel estimates for Tα,βM

Let us define the operator Tα,βM in L2(dμα,β) as in Subsection [\ref=operador_auxiliar]. By using the Poisson semigroup Pt in [\eqref=serie] we can see that

[formula]

where

[formula]

We will prove in this subsection that jujTα + aj,β + bjM can be seen as a Calderón-Zygmund operator with the kernel juj(θ)uj(φ)Tα + aj,β + bjM(θ,φ), and we will deliver the proof of Theorem [\ref=Angular_Riesz_kernel].

Let α,β >  - 1 / 2, [formula], b = 0 or [formula], and let uj be as in [\eqref=ujs], [formula]. When [formula] we also assume that β > 0 and [formula]. Then, the operator jujTα + aj,β + bjM(u- 1j  ·  ) is bounded from L2(dμα,β) into itself.

Before starting with the estimate, we need an identity for the Jacobi polynomials. By using the identities

[formula]

see [\cite=Abra] with n replaced by n - 1, and

[formula]

which follows from [\cite=Abra], we have

[formula]

With the relations dα - 1,βn = Andα,βn and dα + 1,βn - 1 = Bndα,βn, where dα,βn is as in [\eqref=que] and

[formula]

and the substitution x =  cos θ, we conclude from [\eqref=eq:Jacobi-Id] that

[formula]

Let us start with the estimate in the case [formula]. The required L2 estimate can be deduced from the inequality

[formula]

with C a constant independent of α and β. By [\eqref=eq:L2-1], the left-hand side in [\eqref=eq:L2-2] is bounded by the sum of

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now, by taking into account that the sequences [formula] and [formula] are bounded by a constant independent of α and β and the orthogonality, for α > 0, of the systems [formula] and [formula], both summands are controlled by [formula].

For the case [formula], we split

[formula]

,

[formula]

, we can easily check that

[formula]

with g(w) = f(π - w), [formula]. Now, the operators appearing in the right hand side above contain the factor [formula] instead of 1 /  sin θ. So, enlarging the intervals of integration, the boundedness of both integrals is reduced to the previous case.

Proceeding as in Lemma [\ref=CZ_kernel_associated], it is easily seen that jujTα + aj,β + bjM(u- 1jf) are Calderón-Zygmund operators with kernel juj(θ)uj(φ)Tα + aj,β + bjM(θ,φ).

We only need to consider the case [formula], that is, [formula]. If [formula] we observe that [formula], which introduces a singularity in θ = 0 and θ  =  π. In fact, when θ∈(0,π / 2), [formula] behaves as [formula], and the operator [formula] is treated exactly in the same way as Tα,βMf, [formula]. If θ∈(π / 2,π), [formula] behaves as [formula], and the proofs are easily adapted in order to cancel this singularity.

Then, taking into account the expression for the kernel [\eqref=kernel_T] and the identity [\eqref=springer], we have

[formula]

The ideas to get the estimates [\eqref=eq:cresimiento_angular] and [\eqref=eq:suavidad_angular] are completely analogous to the ones used for the Jacobi-Riesz transform estimates in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Thm:Jacobi-Riesz_kernel]. In this way, we apply Lemma [\ref=lem:0] and [\eqref=function_h] with suitable choices in every single case that arises. Further details are omitted.
