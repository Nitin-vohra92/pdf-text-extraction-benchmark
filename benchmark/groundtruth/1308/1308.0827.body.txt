Introduction

Let G,H be graphs. (All graphs in this paper are finite, possibly with loops or parallel edges.) An immersion of H in G is a map η, with domain [formula], mapping each vertex of H to a vertex of G, and each edge of H to a path or cycle of G, satisfying the following:

η(u)  ≠  η(v) for all distinct u,v∈V(H)

for each e∈E(H) with distinct ends u and v, η(e) is a path of G with ends η(u),η(v)

for each loop in H with end v, η(e) is a cycle of G passing through η(v)

for v∈V(H) and e∈E(H), if e is not incident with v in H then η(v)∉V(η(e))

for all distinct e,f∈E(H), [formula].

(Note in particular the fourth condition above; this relation is normally called "strong immersion", but we omit "strong" since we do not need weak immersion in this paper.) If there is an immersion of H in G, we say that "H can be immersed in G" and "G contains H as an immersion" (or just "G immerses H"). If in addition, for all distinct e,f∈E(H), every vertex of [formula] is equal to η(v) for some v∈V(H) incident in H with both e and f, then η is called a subdivision map of H in G.

If g > 1 is an integer, the g  ×  g grid is a graph with vertex set {vij  :1  ≤  i,j  ≤  g}, where vij is adjacent to vi'j' if |i - i'| + |j - j'|  =  1. We denote this graph by Jg. Evidently any graph of maximum degree at most four can be immersed in Jg, if g is sufficiently large (map the vertices far apart, and then route the edges so that no three pass through the same vertex, and any two that share a vertex cross there).

A tree-decomposition of a graph G is a pair (T,(Wt  :t∈V(T))), such that

T is a tree

Wt  ⊆  V(G) for each t∈V(T)

[formula]

for every edge uv of G, there exists t∈V(T) with u,v∈Wt

for t,t',t''∈V(T), if t' belongs to the path of T between t and t'', then [formula].

We call max (|Wt| - 1  :t∈V(T)) the width of the tree-decomposition, and say that G has tree-width k if k is minimum such that G admits a tree-decomposition of width k.

We say that H is a minor of G if a graph isomorphic to H can be obtained from a subgraph of G by contracting edges. The following is well-known [\cite=GM5]:

For all g > 1 there exists k such that every graph with tree-width at least k contains Jg as a minor.

(Note that this is sharp in the sense that for all k there exists g such that no graph of tree-width less than k contains Jg as a minor.) In this paper we prove a similar result for immersion, the following. (Two versions of this result were found independently by two subsets of the authors, and one of these versions appears in [\cite=klimosova].)

For all g > 1 there exists k  ≥  0 such that every four-edge-connected graph with tree-width at least k contains Jg as an immersion.

This is not exactly an analogue of [\ref=gridminor], because it is not sharp in the same sense. It is not true that for all k there exists g such that no four-edge-connected graph of tree-width less than k contains Jg as a minor. To see this, let G be obtained from a star with g2 + 1 vertices by replacing each edge by four parallel edges. Then G has tree-width one, and yet immerses Jg. Thus large tree-width is too strong a requirement. One might think that we should measure the width by decomposing the graph with a tree-structure of edge-cutsets of bounded size, instead of vertex-cutsets (which is essentially what tree-width does); but this is now too weak; a two-vertex graph with many parallel edges has large width under this measure, and yet does not immerse J2. So the correct concept is somewhere between the two, and getting it right is beyond the scope of this paper (see [\cite=wollan]). (Note that these problems arise since there is no bound on the maximum degree of G; if we bound the maximum degree, then the vertex-cut and edge-cut versions of tree-width become equivalent, and [\ref=main1] becomes sharp in the desired sense.)

Let h  ≥  2 be even. An elementary wall of height h is a graph whose vertex set can be labeled

[formula]

where distinct vertices vij,vi'j' are adjacent if either

i  =  i' and |j' - j|  =  1, or

j  =  j' and |i' - i|  =  1 and min (i,i') + j is even.

A wall of height h is a subdivision of an elementary wall of height h, and a wall contained in a graph G (or just a "wall in G") means a subgraph of G that is a wall.

The advantage of walls is that they permit us to state a version of [\ref=gridminor] using subgraphs instead of minors, the following (this is easy to see):

For all even h  ≥  2 there exists k such that every graph with tree-width at least k contains a wall of height h.

Thus the following is equivalent to [\ref=main1]:

For all g > 1 there exists h  ≥  2, even, such that every four-edge-connected graph containing a wall of height h contains Jg as an immersion.

This admits two strengthenings, which we need to describe next. First, with the usual labelling of the vertex set of a wall, the vertices vi,2i  (2  ≤  i  ≤  h) are called its diagonal vertices. We will be able to replace the "four-edge-connected" hypothesis with a weaker hypothesis that a large number of the diagonal vertices are pairwise four-edge-connected. Second we want to show that if we start with a large wall, we get a large grid immersion that is in some sense "close" to the wall. More precisely, we insist that the immersion map each vertex of the grid to one of the diagonal vertices in our 4-edge-connected set. If S  ⊆  V(G), and η is an immersion of H in G, we say η is S-rooted if η(v)∈S for each v∈V(H). The following version of [\ref=main2] incorporates both the strengthenings just discussed, and is the main result of the paper.

For all g > 1 there exists b  ≥  0, with the following property. Let W be a wall contained in a graph G, and let S be a set of diagonal vertices of W, pairwise 4-edge-connected in G, and with |S|  ≥  b. Then there is an S-rooted immersion of Jg in G.

Applying lemmas from graph minors

Let W be a wall of height h, and let W0 be the elementary wall of which W is a subdivision. Label the vertices of W0 as in the definition. Each edge of W0 corresponds to a path of W, and we call such a path a branch of W. Choose h' even with 2  ≤  h'  ≤  h, and choose four integers i1,i2,j1,j2, satisfying

i1,j1 are odd

1  ≤  i1  ≤  i2  ≤  h + 1 and 1  ≤  j1  ≤  j2  ≤  2h

i2 - i1  =  h' and j2 - j1  =  2h' - 1.

Then the subgraph of W0 induced on the vertex set

[formula]

is an elementary wall of height h', and we call such a wall an elementary subwall of W0. The corresponding subgraph of W is called a subwall of W.

Let W be a wall, in a graph G, and let v be a diagonal vertex of W. The surround of v means the set of vertices u of W such that either u  =  v, or there is a path of W between u,v in which every vertex different from v has degree two in W. A fin for W means a triple (s,F,t) such that

s is a diagonal vertex of W,

t∈V(W) does not belong to the surround of s, and

F is a path in G with ends s,t, edge-disjoint from W.

We also call this a fin at s. We say that (W,(si,Fi,ti)1  ≤  i  ≤  b) is a fin system in G if

W is a wall in G

[formula] are diagonal vertices of W, all different

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  b, (si,Fi,ti) is a fin for W, and

for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  b, if i  ≠  j then si∉V(Fj).

In this section we prove the following.

For all g > 1 there exists an integer b  ≥  0, with the following property. Let

[formula]

be a fin system in G. Then there is an [formula]-rooted immersion of Jg in G.

The proof is in several steps. Some of the proofs of the steps are merely sketches, because they are standard applications of methods of the graph minors papers (rather straightforward, since the underlying graph is a wall), and to import all the definitions and theorems of the corresponding graph minors papers and to apply them precisely would take a considerable amount of space (and we suspect would not improve clarity).

Let W be an elementary wall of height h; then there is a drawing of W in the plane so that all finite regions have boundary of length six (and such a drawing is unique up to homeomorphisms of the plane). We call this the standard drawing. A standard drawing of a wall is obtained by subdividing edges of the standard drawing of the corresponding elementary wall, and we call the finite regions bricks.

Let W be a wall with its standard drawing. If s,t are points of the plane, we define their distance d(s,t) to be zero if s  =  t, and otherwise to be the minimum of the number of points of F in the drawing, taken over all subsets F in the plane homeomorphic to

Four-edge-connectivity

In this section we use [\ref=fins] to prove [\ref=main3]. We begin with a lemma.

For all g > 1 let b be as in [\ref=fins]. Let G be a graph, and let η0 be an immersion in G of an elementary wall W0, and let S0 be a set of diagonal vertices of W0, such that

if e,f are distinct edges of W0 and some internal vertex of η0(e) equals some internal vertex of η0(f), then there exists s∈S0 incident with both e,f

|S0| = b

for each s∈S0 there is a path F of G with distinct ends η0(s),t, where t is a vertex of [formula] and no edge of F belongs to E(η0(W0))).

Then there is an η0(S0)-rooted immersion of Jg in G.

Proof.   Let [formula], say, and for 1  ≤  i  ≤  b let Fi be a path from η0(si) to some vertex ti of [formula] as in the theorem. We proceed by induction on the sum, over all pairs of distinct edges e,f of W0, of the number of vertices in [formula]. For this quantity fixed, we proceed by induction on the sum of the lengths of [formula]. We may therefore assume that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  b, ti is the only vertex of Fi that belongs to [formula]. If there do not exist distinct edges e,f of W0 such that some internal vertex of η0(e) equals some internal vertex of η0(f), then η0(W0) is a wall and the result follows from [\ref=fins]. Thus we assume that some v is an internal vertex of [formula] say, where [formula] are distinct edges of W0 and k  ≥  2. From the hypothesis, every two of [formula] have a common end in S0, and since every edge has at most one end in S0, it follows that [formula] are all incident with some member of S0, say s1. It follows that [formula], and so v  ≠  t1.

Let d1,d2 be the two edges of η0(e1) incident with v, with ends u1,v and u2,v respectively. Let G' be obtained from G by deleting d1,d2 and adding a new edge d0  =  u1u2. Let η0'(w)  =  η(w) for all w∈V(W0), and η0'(d)  =  η(d) for all d∈E(W0) with d  ≠  e1; let η0'(e1) be a path joining the ends of η0(e1) with edge set in [formula]. Then η0' is an immersion of W0 in G'. Moreover, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  b, if ti  =  v then e2 is not incident with si (because e2 is incident with none of [formula], and t1  ≠  v). Consequently, [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  b. Thus from the inductive hypothesis, the theorem holds for G', and hence it also holds for G. This proves [\ref=immfin].

Proof of [\ref=main3].   Let b be as in [\ref=fins] (we may assume that b  ≥  2). Let W be a wall in G, and let S be a set of diagonal vertices with |S| = b, pairwise four-edge-connected in G. Let W0 be an elementary wall of the same height, and let S0 be the set of diagonal vertices of W0 mapped to S under the corresponding subdivision map. Choose an immersion η0 of W0 in G and a subset D of S0, with the following properties:

if e,f are distinct edges of W0 and some internal vertex of η0(e) equals some internal vertex of η0(f), then there exists s∈S0 incident with both e,f

η0(s)∈S for each s∈S0

for each s∈D there is a path F of G with distinct ends η0(s),t, where t is a vertex of [formula] and no edge of F belongs to E(η0(W0))

subject to all these conditions, |D| is maximum.

(Satisfying the first three conditions is trivially possible, taking [formula] and η0 the subdivision map to W.)

Suppose that there exists [formula]. Let the three neighbours of s' in W0 be x1,x2,x3, and let B1,B2,B3 be the images under η0 of the edges s'x1,s'x2,s'x3. Now since |S|  ≥  2 and η0(s') is four-edge-connected to the other members of S, it follows that there are four edge-disjoint paths [formula] of G from η0(s') to [formula], each with no internal vertex in [formula]; and since the three branches of η0(W0) incident with η0(s') provide three such paths, it follows from the theory of augmenting paths that [formula] can be chosen such that P1,P2,P3 have final vertices η0(x1),η0(x2),η0(x3) respectively. Let P4 have final vertex t' say. Now let η0'(v)  =  η0(v) for each v∈V(W0), and η0'(e)  =  η0(e) for every edge e of W0 not incident with s'; let η0'(s'xi)  =  Pi for i  =  1,2,3. It follows that η0' is an immersion of W0 in G, satisfying the second condition above. Moreover, the first condition above is satisfied; for if e,f are distinct edges of W0 and some internal vertex of η0'(e) equals some internal vertex of η0'(f), we may assume that e is incident with s' and f is not; but then some internal vertex of one of P1,P2,P3 belongs to [formula], a contradiction. Let [formula]; we claim that the third condition is satisfied. Certainly, the new member s' of D' satisfies the condition, since P4 is a path of G with distinct ends η0'(s'),t', and t' is a vertex of [formula] and no edge of P4 belongs to E(η0'(W0))); but we must check that the other members of D' still satisfy the condition. Thus, let s∈D. There is a path F of G with distinct ends η0(s),t, where t is a vertex of [formula] and no edge of F belongs to E(η0(W0)). The same path F also works for η0' unless either

t is not a vertex of [formula]; this implies that t is an internal vertex of one of B1,B2,B3, and then we can augment F to a path with the desired properties; or

some edge or internal vertex of F belongs to E(η0'(W0))); but this implies that some edge or internal vertex of F belongs to one of P1,P2,P3, and then a subpath of F has the desired properties, since s  ≠  s'.

Thus the three conditions are still satisfied, contrary to the maximality of |D|. Thus there is no such s', and so D  =  S0, and the result follows from [\ref=immfin]. This completes the proof of [\ref=main3].
