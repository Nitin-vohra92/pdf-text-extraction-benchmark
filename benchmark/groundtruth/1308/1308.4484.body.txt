Introduction

We begin by describing the Bruck-Bose representation of a translation plane of order q2 with kernel containing [formula] in [formula], proved independently by André [\cite=andr54] and Bruck and Bose [\cite=bruc64] [\cite=bruc66]. Let Σ ∞  be a hyperplane of [formula] and let S be a spread of Σ ∞ . Consider the incidence structure whose points are the points of [formula], whose lines are the planes of PG(4,q) which do not lie in Σ∞ but which meet Σ∞ in a line of S and where incidence is inclusion. This incidence structure is an affine translation plane and can be uniquely completed to a projective translation plane P(S) of order q2 by adjoining the line at infinity [formula] whose points are the elements of the spread S. The line [formula] is a translation line for P(S). The translation plane P(S) is Desarguesian if and only if the spread S is regular ([\cite=bruc64]). For more details on the Bruck-Bose representation, see [\cite=barw08], in particular, note that Baer subplanes of [formula] secant to [formula] are in one to one correspondence with affine planes of [formula] that do not contain a line of the regular spread S.

In [formula], with Σ ∞  being the hyperplane at infinity, we call the points of [formula] affine points and the points in Σ ∞  infinite points. The lines and planes of [formula] that are not contained in Σ ∞  are called affine lines and affine planes respectively.

Now consider a non-degenerate conic [formula] in [formula] that is tangent to [formula] in the point P∞. In the Bruck-Bose representation of [formula] in [formula], the affine points [formula] correspond to a set of q2 affine points in [formula] also denoted by C. These points satisfy a variety of properties. In [\cite=barwcaps], algebraic properties of these points were determined, and it was shown they were caps. In this article we are interested in combinatorial properties the points satisfy, in particular, combinatorial properties relating to the planes of [formula]. Our aim was to find the smallest set of these properties that would allow us to reconstruct the projective plane and the conic [formula]. The properties of the conic in [formula] that we are interested in are given in the next lemma, which is proved in Section [\ref=section:lemma-proof].

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate conic of [formula], q odd, that is tangent to [formula] in a point P∞. Define a C-plane to be a Baer subplane of [formula] that is secant to [formula] and meets [formula] in q points. Then

Each C-plane meets C in a q-arc. Further, if a Baer subplane secant to [formula] meets C in more than four points, it is a C-plane.

Every pair of points of C lie in exactly one C-plane.

The affine points of [formula] are of three types: points of C; points on no C-plane (the interior points of [formula]); and points on exactly two C-planes (the exterior points of [formula]).

We now consider what these properties correspond to in the Bruck-Bose representation in [formula]. The points of C correspond to affine points of [formula], and the C-plane s correspond to affine planes of [formula] that contain q points of C. We suppose that we have a set of affine points and C-planes satisfying the [formula] equivalence of the combinatorial properties of Lemma [\ref=conic-satisfies-props], and show that we can reconstruct the conic in the Bruck-Bose plane. The main result of this paper is the characterisation given in the next theorem.

Let Σ ∞  be the hyperplane at infinity in [formula], [formula], q odd. Let C be a set of q2 affine points, called C-points, and suppose there exists a set of affine planes called C-plane s satisfying the following properties:

Each C-plane meets C in a q-arc. Further, if a plane meets C in more than four points, it is a C-plane.

Every pair of points of C lie in exactly one C-plane.

The affine points of [formula] are of three types: points of C, points on no C-plane, and points on exactly two C-plane s.

Then there exists a unique spread S in Σ ∞  so that the C-point s in the Bruck-Bose plane P(S) form a q2-arc of P(S). Moreover, the spread S is regular, and so [formula], and the q2-arc can be completed to a conic of [formula].

We note that a similar characterisation when q is even is given in [\cite=conicqeven].

The rest of this paper is devoted to proving this theorem. The main structure of the proof is as follows. We need a number of preliminary results, leading to Theorem [\ref=lines-form-a-spread] where we show how to construct a spread S of Σ ∞  from C. In Corollary [\ref=cor:regular-spread], we show that S is a regular spread. In Theorem [\ref=thm:isanarc], we show that the set C corresponds to a q2-arc in the Bruck-Bose plane [formula], and hence as q is odd, C is contained in a unique conic. In Theorem [\ref=thm:diffspread], we show that if S' is any other spread of Σ ∞ , then the points of C will not correspond to an arc in the associated Bruck-Bose plane P(S').

Proof of Lemma [\ref=conic-satisfies-props]

In this section we prove that a conic in [formula] satisfies the combinatorial properties stated in Lemma [\ref=conic-satisfies-props].

Let [formula] be a non-degenerate conic in [formula] tangent to [formula] in the point P∞, and let [formula]. We begin with a note about subconics of [formula] in Baer subplanes. Suppose π is a Baer subplane that meets [formula] in a subconic O. Note that for each point P in [formula], the tangent line of [formula] at P is a line of π. Conversely, if a line [formula] of π is a tangent line of [formula], then the point of contact [formula] lies in π.

We now prove part 1. The q points of C in a C-plane lie on the conic [formula], so are clearly a q-arc. Suppose π is a Baer subplane secant to [formula] which meets C in five points, then those five points define a unique conic in [formula], namely [formula]. Further, the five points define a unique conic O in π, which is necessarily a subconic of [formula]. As π is secant to [formula], it contains the tangent [formula] to [formula], hence by the above note, it contains the point P∞ of contact of the tangent [formula] to [formula]. Hence π meets C in q points, and so is a C-plane.

For part 2, let P,Q be two points of C with tangents to [formula] labeled tP, tQ respectively. Suppose π is any Baer subplane secant to [formula] containing P,Q. As π contains [formula], it contains P∞ by the above note. Further, as π contains P,Q, we have that tP,tQ are lines of π. Thus π contains the quadrangle [formula] and hence there is exactly one such subplane. However, the quadrangle [formula] defines a unique Baer subplane which contains five elements from the conic [formula]: namely the points P,Q,P∞ and the tangents [formula], and thus contains a subconic of [formula] containing P∞. Thus every pair of points of C lie on exactly one C-plane.

Note that this allows us to count the number of C-planes. Let A be the incidence structure with points the points of C; lines the C-planes; and inherited incidence. Then A is a 2-(q2,q,1) design, and so is an affine plane of order q. Hence there are q2 + q C-planes.

To prove part 3, let π be a C-plane, and let X be an affine point of π that is not in C. Then X lies on two tangents of [formula], which lie either in π or in [formula], depending on whether X is an exterior point or an interior point of the conic [formula]. In either case, X lies on two tangents of [formula] in [formula], and so is an exterior point of [formula]. Hence the affine points in a C-plane either lie in C, or are exterior points of [formula]. That is, the interior points of [formula] lie on zero C-planes. It is straightforward to show that the group of homographies of [formula] fixing [formula] and [formula] is transitive on the affine exterior points of [formula]. Hence all the affine exterior points of [formula] lie on a common number x of C-planes. We now count incident pairs (X,π) where X is an affine exterior point of [formula] that lies on a C-plane π. We have q2(q2 - 1) / 2  ×  x = (q2 + q)(q2 - q), hence x = 2 as required.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]

Properties of C-planes

Let C be a set of q2 affine points in [formula], [formula], q odd, satisfying assumptions (A1), (A2) and (A3) of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. We begin by noting that the C-points and C-plane s form an affine plane. This gives us a natural set of parallel classes which will be useful in our proof.

Let A be the incidence structure with points the points of C ; lines the C-plane s; and inherited incidence. Then A is an affine plane of order q, and so there are q2 + q C-plane s. Hence there are q + 1 parallel classes of C-planes, each containing q parallel C-plane s.

By (A1) and (A2), A is a 2-(q2,q,1) design and so is an affine plane of order q.

Note that in [formula], two C-planes π,α meet in a point or a line. The parallel classes of the affine plane A tell us whether the intersection [formula] contains a C-point. So we have: if π and α belong to the same parallel class, then they have no common C-point; whereas if π and α belong to different parallel classes, then they share exactly one C-point.

Let π be a C-plane. By (A1), π contains q C-point s that form a q-arc. As q is odd, this arc uniquely completes to a conic by the addition of a point which we denote π∞ (see [\cite=hirs98]). We call π∞ the ∞  -point of π since we will show in Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem] that π∞ is on the line [formula], and so is an infinite point of [formula]. That is:

Let π be a C-plane, then the ∞  -point π∞ of π is the point that uniquely completes the q-arc [formula] to a conic.

To study the intersection of C-planes in more detail, we will need the next lemma involving three C-planes that all contain a fixed ∞  -point.

Let π be a C-plane with ∞  -point π∞. Suppose two C-plane s α,β both meet π in distinct lines through π∞. Then α and β share no point other than π∞.

Let π,α,β be C-planes such that [formula], [formula] are distinct lines through π∞. Note that if [formula], then π∞ is on three C-plane s, namely π, α and β, contradicting (A3). So we have π∞∈Σ∞. Suppose α and β meet in a line [formula] (so [formula] contains π∞). The line [formula] contains at most one C-point by (A2). Note that the q + 1 lines of π through π∞ consist of q 1-secants to C, and one 0-secant to C. Hence at least one of the lines [formula], [formula] is a 1-secant of C. Without loss of generality, suppose [formula] meets C in the point B. As C meets π in a q-arc, there are two 1-secants to C through B in π, one is Bπ∞, let the other meet [formula] in the point R. In the plane β, there are two 1-secants to C through B, one is Bπ∞, let the other meet [formula] in the point S.

We now show that there exists a 2-secant m of [formula] which does not contain the points S,R or π∞, and which does not meet [formula] or [formula] in a C-point. As [formula], the q-arc [formula] has at least five points X,Y,Z,V,W which do not lie on [formula] or on [formula] (each of which contain at most one C-point). A 2-secant through two of these points will meet [formula] and [formula] in points that are not in C. First consider the three 2-secants XY,XZ,YZ. If none of these is suitable, then each contains one of R, S, π∞. So next consider the three 2-secants XW,YW,ZW. If none of these is suitable, then each contains one of R,S,π∞. Without loss of generality suppose R∈XW, S∈YW and π∞∈ZW. Hence we also have R∈YZ, S∈XZ, and π∞∈XY. Now consider the 2-secant VX. If S∈VX, then X,Z,V would be collinear, contradicting [formula] being an arc. So S∉VX. Similarly [formula] and [formula]. So m = VX is a 2-secant of C not containing R,S or π∞, and meeting [formula] and [formula] in points not in C.

So there exists a line m in α that contains two C-points, but does not contain the points S,R or π∞, and does not meet [formula] or [formula] in a C-point. Consider the plane τ  =  〈m,B〉. Now, τ meets β in a line through B that is not a 1-secant of C as π∞,S∉τ. Hence τ contains two points of [formula] (one of which is B). Similarly, τ meets π in two points of [formula], one of which is B. Hence τ contains five distinct points of C, and so is a C-plane by (A1). Hence m contains two C-points which lie on two C-plane s, namely α and τ, contradicting (A2). Hence α and β cannot meet in a line [formula], so they share no point other than π∞.

The next lemma is key to our proof. We first show that for each C-plane π, the ∞  -point π∞ of the q-arc [formula] lies in Σ ∞ . Then we study how C-plane s can meet, and investigate properties of the parallel classes of the affine plane A defined in Lemma [\ref=affine-plane]. We use the following definition.

If π is a C-plane, then we call the line [formula] a C-line.

If π is a C-plane, then its ∞  -point π∞ lies in Σ ∞ .

Let π,α be distinct C-planes.

If π,α lie in the same parallel class, then they meet in exactly one point π∞ (which is equal to α∞).

If π,α lie in different parallel classes, then they either meet in exactly one point of C, or they meet in an affine line through π∞ (which is equal to α∞) that contains one point of C.

The C-plane s which are in a common parallel class all share the same ∞  -point, and they pairwise intersect in only this ∞  -point. Moreover, every ∞  -point defines exactly two parallel classes.

Let π be a fixed C-plane and let [formula]. We say a C-plane α (distinct from π) covers an affine point P of [formula] if it contains P. Further an affine line of π is called a cover line of π if it is contained in a C-plane distinct from π.

We work with the parallel classes of the affine plane A defined in Lemma [\ref=affine-plane]. The q points of [formula] each lie on q further C-planes (one in each of the parallel classes not containing π). The q2 - q affine points of [formula] each lie in exactly one further C-plane by (A3). That is, each of the q2 - q affine points of [formula] is covered by exactly one C-plane. We will investigate how the C-planes cover these points. First we look at how another C-plane α meets π. Now [formula] is either a point or a line of [formula]. If α,π are in different parallel classes, then α,π contain exactly one common C-point, so [formula] is either a C-point, or an affine 1-secant of C. If α,π are in the same parallel class, then α,π contain no common C-point. Let

[formula]

be the C-planes in the same parallel class as π. Then we have:

If [formula], then α meets π in either a point of [formula] (possibly in Σ ∞ ); or an affine 0-secant of [formula]; or an infinite line.

If [formula], then α meets π in either exactly one C-point, or in an affine 1-secant of [formula].

We now focus on I(a) and show that no C-plane in [formula] meets π in an affine line. Suppose there is one such plane [formula] meeting π in the affine line b, so b is a 0-secant of [formula] (we work towards a contradiction to show that b cannot exist). No other cover line in π can meet b in an affine point, otherwise that point would be on three C-plane s, contradicting (A3). Hence every other cover line of π (if any) meets b in the point [formula].

Let L be the set of q affine lines of π through X. There are four possibilities for these lines, depending on the location of the ∞  -point π∞. Firstly, suppose π∞∈Σ ∞ . Note that π∞ lies on exactly one 0-secant of [formula], which in this case is [formula]. Hence π∞  ≠  X, as otherwise X lies on two 0-secants of [formula], namely [formula] and b. Thus the q lines of L consist of one 1-secant, [formula] 2-secants, and [formula] 0-secants of [formula]. Secondly, if [formula] and Xπ∞ is a 0-secant of [formula], then L contains one 1-secant, [formula] 2-secants and [formula] 0-secants of [formula]. Thirdly, if [formula] and Xπ∞ is a 1-secant of [formula], then either L contains three 1-secants, [formula] 2-secants and [formula] 0-secants of [formula], or L contains one 1-secant, [formula] 2-secants and [formula] 0-secants of [formula].

Let L'  ⊂  L be the set of 2-secants of [formula] through X. In each of the four cases, L' contains either [formula] or [formula] lines. As [formula], L' contains at least two lines [formula]. By I, the affine cover lines of π are either 0-secants or 1-secants of [formula], so [formula] and m are not cover lines. Further, we noted above that all cover lines must contain X. Hence the affine points of [formula] not in C are not contained in any cover lines. Thus by I, the affine points of [formula] not in C must be covered by planes in [formula], with each plane covering at most one affine point. However, there are 2(q - 2) such affine points and only q - 2 C-plane s in [formula], a contradiction. Hence the line b does not exist, so no C-plane in [formula] meets π in an affine line. Hence the following modification of I(a) holds:

If [formula], then α meets π in either a point of [formula], or in an infinite line.

We now show that π∞∈Σ ∞ . By I(a)', C-plane s in [formula] meet π in either 0 or 1 affine points. Hence the C-plane s in [formula] cover at most q - 1 of the q2 - q affine points of [formula]. Recall that each of these affine points is covered by exactly one C-plane. By I(b), C-plane s not in [formula] either meet π in exactly a C-point or in a 1-secant of [formula]. So there are at least ((q2 - q) - (q - 1)) / (q - 1) = q - 1 C-plane s not in [formula] that meet π in a cover line, denote them by

[formula]

For each i, αi and π have exactly one common C-point, denoted Ai. As the cover line [formula] is a 1-secant of the q-arc [formula] in π, it is either the line Aiπ∞, or it is the unique tangent line at Ai to the conic [formula], denote this tangent line by [formula]. Suppose one of the cover lines [formula] is the unique tangent line [formula] (we work towards a contradiction to show this cannot happen). Note that two cover lines cannot meet in an affine point of [formula] by (A3). As the cover lines [formula] are all 1-secants, they either meet [formula] in A1 (there is at most one other such 1-secant, namely A1π∞) or in a 1-secant through [formula] (there are at most two other such 1-secants through [formula]). This gives at most three other possibilities for cover lines, contradicting [formula]. Thus no tangent line [formula] is a cover line, so Aiπ∞ is a cover line for [formula]. That is, π∞ lies on q C-planes, so by (A3), π∞ lies in [formula]. This completes part 1.

We now further improve I(a)' and show that the C-planes in [formula] either meet π in the infinite point π∞, or in an infinite line. First note that we have shown that the q - 1 C-plane s in [formula] all contain π∞. Hence by Lemma [\ref=one-parallel-class], these planes pairwise meet only in π∞. In particular, they pairwise have no common C-point. Hence the planes in [formula] all belong to the same parallel class, of which there is one more member, αq say. Denote by [formula] the set of q - 1 affine points of [formula] that are not covered by the C-plane s in [formula]. The points of [formula] lie on a line through π∞. We will show that αq meets π in this line.

Consider a plane [formula]. A similar argument to that of part 1 shows that the ∞  -point [formula]. If α1 and π share C-line s, that is [formula], then α1,π must coincide since they share two lines, namely their C-line and an affine line. Hence their C-line s are distinct, and a similar argument to that of part 1 shows that π meets α1 in a line through (α1)∞, hence (α1)∞  =  π∞. Next, similar to the set [formula] related to the C-plane π, consider the set [formula] of at least q - 1 C-plane s that each meet α1 in a line through (α1)∞. By the above argument, they lie in a common parallel class. As [formula], it follows that the parallel class containing [formula] is the parallel class [formula] (since every C-plane belongs to exactly one parallel class). Hence the (at least) q - 2 planes [formula] satisfy (βi)∞ = (α1)∞  =  π∞. Thus at least q - 2 of the C-plane s in [formula] meet π exactly in the point π∞. In particular, at least q - 2 of the βi contain no affine points of π. Hence there are at least q - 2 affine points in the set [formula] that are not covered by planes in [formula]. Hence by I, there is a C-plane α not in [formula] that meets π in a 1-secant of [formula] through π∞. This line covers q - 1 affine points, so covers all the points of [formula]. Note that by Lemma [\ref=one-parallel-class], α belongs to the parallel class containing [formula], so α  =  αq. In summary, we have:

C-planes in the parallel class [formula] all contain π∞, and pairwise contain no common affine point;

Each C-plane in the parallel class [formula] meets π in a 1-secant through π∞;

the remaining C-planes each meet π in exactly one C-point.

To complete the proof of part 2, we need to show that C-planes in [formula] meet π in exactly π∞. Suppose not, that is, by II, suppose that there is a C-plane β1 in [formula] that meets π in an infinite line, so [formula]. Let [formula], so α meets π in a 1-secant through π∞. As π,β1 are in the same parallel class, β1 and α lie in different parallel classes, so have a common C-point, A say. Then the line Aπ∞ lies in both β and α, contradicting Lemma [\ref=one-parallel-class]. Hence C-planes in the parallel class [formula] pairwise meet in exactly the point π∞.

Hence we have shown that C-plane s in the same parallel class have the same ∞  -point, and pairwise meet in exactly this point. To prove the second statement of part 3, we note that by II, the C-planes in the parallel classes [formula] and [formula] all contain the point π∞. Further, the remaining C-planes do not contain π∞. So π∞ lies on the C-planes of precisely two parallel classes.

This lemma shows that two C-planes cannot meet in a C-line, so we have:

Each C-plane has a unique C-line, so there are q2 + q distinct C-lines in Σ ∞ .

We now characterise the points of Σ∞ in relation to the C-line s.

A point of Σ∞ that lies on no C-line is called a 0-point.

There are three types of points in Σ∞: [formula] ∞  -point s, [formula] 0-points, and q3 + q2 points which lie on exactly one C-line each.

Let [formula] be two C-lines in Σ ∞ , and let α,β be the unique C-planes with C-lines [formula] respectively. By Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2), [formula] meet in a exactly one point (namely α∞  =  β∞), or not at all. So each point of Σ ∞  is either a 0-point, an ∞  -point, or lies on exactly one C-line. By Corollary [\ref=count-cline], the number of points on exactly one C-line is (q2 + q)q = q3 + q2. By Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](3), each ∞  -point lies in exactly two parallel classes, hence there are [formula] ∞  -point s. Thus the number of 0-points is [formula].

As a direct consequence of this proof, we have the following corollary which tells us how C-lines are positioned in Σ ∞ .

If two C-lines meet, then they do so in an ∞  -point. Further, each ∞  -point lies on exactly 2q C-lines.

Defining a spread in Σ ∞

In this section we show how we can use the points of C to construct a spread in Σ ∞ . We show that each C-point A defines a unique line tA in Σ ∞ . These resulting q2 lines are mutually skew. The remaining q + 1 points in Σ ∞  are the 0-points and ∞  -point s, we show they lie on a line t∞, and that the lines tA and t∞ form a spread in Σ ∞ . We begin by defining for each C-point A, a set of q + 1 points tA in Σ ∞ .

Let A be C-point and let π be a C-plane through A. The unique tangent to the conic [formula] at the point A meets Σ ∞  in a point which we denote Aπ. Note that Aπ is on the C-line of π. There are q + 1 C-plane s πi, [formula], through A. Define tA to be the set of q + 1 points Aπi, [formula].

We show in Theorem [\ref=cline-cover] that the set tA is a line in Σ ∞ . First we show that the ∞  -points and the 0-points lie on a line of Σ ∞ , denoted t∞.

The set of ∞  -point s and 0-points lie on a line t∞.

Let [formula] denote the set of ∞  -point s and 0-points, so by Lemma [\ref=lem:pttype], [formula]. Let α be any plane of Σ ∞ . If α contains a C-line, then it contains an ∞  -point and so meets [formula]. If α does not contain a C-line, then α contains at most one point of each of the q2 + q C-line s of Σ ∞ . As α has q2 + q + 1 points, it follows that α meets [formula] in at least one point. Hence every plane of Σ ∞  meets [formula], and so by [\cite=hirs98], [formula] is a line.

The next two lemmas investigate the 3-space spanned by two C-planes.

A 3-space contains at most two C-plane s.

Let α, β be two C-planes that span a 3-space, so by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2), they are in different parallel classes, and α∞  =  β∞. Thus, for a 3-space to contain three C-plane s, they would have a common ∞  -point, and the planes would be pairwise in different parallel class. This cannot occur as through any ∞  -point there are at most two parallel classes by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](3).

Let Σ be a 3-space containing two distinct C-plane s α and β. Then the C-points in Σ are exactly the C-points in α and β.

If two C-plane s α and β generate a 3-space Σ, then they meet in a line [formula], which by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2) contains a unique C-point A. Further, α,β are in different parallel classes. Suppose Σ contains a further C-point B not in α or β. Of the q + 1 C-plane s through B, one is parallel to α, one is parallel to β and one contains A. Let π be any of the q - 2  ≥  1 remaining C-plane s through B. Then π meets α in a C-point  C and β in a C-point D. As B,C,D are C-points, they are not collinear, so π  =  〈B,C,D〉. Hence π,α,β are three C-plane s contained in a 3-space Σ, contradicting Lemma [\ref=cor:old4].

We now show that the set of points tA defined in [\ref=def:tA] form a line of Σ ∞ .

For each C-point A, the set tA is a line of Σ ∞ .

By Lemma [\ref=lem:pttype], there are (q + 1) / 2 ∞  -points, label these [formula]. Let A be a C-point, each of the q + 1 C-planes through A contains exactly one ∞  -point. If three C-planes α,β,γ through A contained the same ∞  -point T1 say, then by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2), they are all in different parallel classes. However, this contradicts Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](3) as T1 defines exactly two parallel classes. Hence each of these q + 1 ∞  -points lies in exactly two C-planes that contain A. Hence the q + 1 C-planes [formula] through A can be ordered so that the pair (π1,π2) both contain T1, the pair (π3,π4) both contain T2, and so on.

For each C-plane πi, [formula], through A, define the point Aπi as in Definition [\ref=def:tA], and let [formula]. Now π1,π2 both contain the line AT1, so Σ  =  〈π1,π2〉 is a 3-space. Consider the plane [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=cor:old4], π1 and π2 are the only C-planes contained in Σ, so the remaining q2 + q - 2 C-planes each meet Σ in a line. We now show that each of these q2 + q - 2 lines meet the plane σ∞ in exactly one point. Suppose not, that is, suppose that some C-plane π meets σ∞ in a line [formula], so [formula] is the C-line of π. Let m,n be the C-lines of π1,π2 respectively. So the plane σ∞ contains three C-lines [formula] which pairwise meet. By Corollary [\ref=cline-infty], these C-lines contain a common ∞  -point, namely T1. As π1,π2 meet in a line, by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2), π1,π2 are in different parallel classes, and π is in same parallel class as one of π1,π2. Suppose π is in the same parallel class as π1, then by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem], π meets π2 in a line. So as [formula] is also in σ∞, we conclude that π lies in Σ, contradicting Lemma [\ref=cor:old4]. Thus each of the q2 + q - 1 C-plane s distinct from π1,π2 contain exactly one point of σ∞.

In particular, as the C-plane s [formula] all contain A∈Σ, they meet Σ in affine lines labelled [formula] respectively, so each line [formula] meets Σ ∞  in a point. As [formula] all contain the point A, they contain no further C-point s of π1 and π2. In particular, [formula], [formula] does not contain any C-point s that lie in π1 or π2 (other than A). By Lemma [\ref=two-cplanes-3-sp], the only C-points in Σ are those in π1 and π2. Hence each [formula] contains exactly one C-point, namely A. Recall that π1 and π2 have a common ∞  -point T1, and that [formula] do not contain T1. Thus in πi, [formula] contains exactly one C-point A, but does not meet t∞. Hence the line [formula] is the required tangent line to A in πi, and hence meets σ∞ in the point Aπi.

From this we conclude that if σ∞ is the plane defined by the C-line s of π1 and π2, then σ∞ contains all the points Aπi for [formula]. Next we repeat the argument with the pair (π3,π4) and define σ'∞ to be the plane defined by the C-line s of π3 and π4. A similar argument shows that σ'∞ contains all the points Aπi for [formula]. As σ∞ and σ'∞ meet t∞ in distinct points, it follows that they meet in a line (disjoint from t∞), and this line tA contains the q + 1 points Aπi for [formula].

The next two corollaries follow from the definition of tA, and this result that tA is a line.

Any C-plane containing the point A∈C meets the line tA, and conversely, any C-plane that meets tA contains the point A.

Let A be a C-point, then the affine plane 〈tA,A〉 contains exactly one C-point.

We now show that we can use these lines to construct a spread in Σ ∞ .

The lines tA, A∈C, together with t∞ form a spread S of Σ∞.

Let π be a C-plane with C-line [formula], and consider the conic [formula] in π. The line [formula] is a tangent to D, hence every point of [formula] lies on one further tangent of D. That is, each point of [formula] lies in exactly one line tA. By Lemma [\ref=lem:pttype], each point of [formula] lies in exactly one C-line, hence each point of [formula] lies in exactly one of the tA. Further, the number of points in [formula] equals the number of points on the q2 lines tA. Hence the lines tA, A∈C and t∞ are mutually disjoint, and form a spread of Σ ∞ .

The spread S is regular

In this section we will show that the spread [formula] is regular. We begin with two lemmas showing how certain affine planes meet C.

Let [formula] be a line of Σ ∞  that meets t∞, but is not a C-line. Then

Every affine plane containing [formula] meets C in at most two points.

If [formula] meets a spread line tA (with corresponding C-point A), then the plane [formula] contains exactly one C-point, namely A.

Let [formula] be a line of Σ ∞  that meets t∞ in a point, but is not a C-line. Suppose π is an affine plane through [formula] that contains three C-points P,Q,R. By (A2), the points P,Q lie on a unique C-plane, denoted πPQ. Similarly we have C-plane s πPR,πQR. As [formula] is not a C-line, π is not a C-plane, hence the three C-plane s πPQ,πPR,πQR are distinct. Consider the 3-space Σ  =  〈t∞,π〉. Now [formula] are three non-collinear points in πPQ and in Σ, hence πPQ  ⊂  Σ. Similarly πPR,πQR  ⊂  Σ. This contradicts Lemma [\ref=cor:old4]. Hence every affine plane through [formula] meets C in at most two points, proving part 1.

The line [formula] meets t∞ and q other lines of the spread, let tA be one such line, and let A be the C-point corresponding to tA. Consider the plane [formula], and suppose it contains a second point R of C. By (A2), there is a unique C-plane πAR through A,R. The line AR meets [formula] in a point X. By Corollary [\ref=cor:tA2], X∉tA, and the line through A and [formula] is a 1-secant of C, so X lies on a unique spread line tB, B  ≠  A. Hence the C-plane πAR meets [formula] in this point X, that is, the C-line [formula] meets [formula] in the point X of tB. Further [formula] as m is a C-line but [formula] is not, so [formula] and m meet t∞ in distinct points. Also note that as A∈πAR, we have by Corollary [\ref=cor:tA] that πAR meets tA, that is, m meets tA. Hence [formula] is a plane that contains the spread lines t∞,tA, a contradiction as t∞,tA are skew by Theorem [\ref=lines-form-a-spread]. Hence we have shown that [formula] contains only one C-point, namely A.

The next two lemmas examine planes that contain t∞.

Each affine plane through t∞ meets C in exactly one point.

Suppose α is a plane through t∞ that meets C in two points A,B. By (A2), there is a unique C-plane πAB containing A and B. Let [formula], then Y is the ∞  -point of πAB, and so Y can be added to [formula] to form a conic. This is a contradiction as the line AB meets this conic in three points, namely A,B,Y. Hence each affine plane through t∞ meets C in at most one point. As there are q2 affine planes through t∞ and q2 points of C, we have exactly one C-point in each affine plane about t∞.

Every plane in Σ ∞  containing t∞ contains q C-line s through a common ∞  -point, and the corresponding q C-plane s are in one parallel class.

Consider the q + 1 planes of Σ ∞  through t∞. By Corollary [\ref=cline-infty], each plane about t∞ contains at most q C-line s through a common ∞  -point. There are q2 + q C-line s, hence each of the q + 1 planes about t∞ contains exactly q C-line s through a common ∞  -point.

Let [formula] be two C-lines in the same plane of Σ ∞  about t∞. Let α,β be the two C-plane s with C-line s [formula] respectively. Suppose α,β are in different parallel classes, then by Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2) they meet in a line containing a C-point A, and span a 3-space. Consider any other C-line n in the plane [formula]. Now if δ is the C-plane with C-line n, then δ cannot be parallel to both α and β as α and β are not in the same parallel class. So without loss of generality say δ meets α in the C-point B. Consider the 3-space 〈α,β〉. It contains [formula] and m, and so contains n. Further, it contains B, so δ  ⊂  〈α,β〉. This contradicts Lemma [\ref=cor:old4]. Hence α and β are not in different parallel classes, that is, the C-line s in a plane of Σ ∞  through t∞ pass through a common ∞  -point, and are contained in C-plane s that belong to a common parallel class.

We now consider a line of Σ ∞  meeting t∞ and q other spread lines, and show that the corresponding C-points lie in a common C-plane.

If [formula] is a line of Σ ∞  meeting spread lines [formula], then the corresponding C-points [formula] lie on a common C-plane.

Let [formula] be a line meeting spread lines [formula]. Let [formula]. Let π be a C-plane not through V, let A be a C-point not in π and let Σ  =  〈A,π〉. We first show that V∉Σ. By Lemma [\ref=lemma-plane-thru-tinfty], the plane 〈t∞,A〉 contains exactly C-point, namely A. As each affine line of π through [formula] meets C in a point, 〈t∞,A〉 meets the plane π in exactly the point π∞. Hence 〈t∞,A〉 is not a plane of Σ, and so t∞ is not contained in Σ, thus V∉Σ. Hence we can project the points of C from V onto Σ to obtain a set C'. By Lemma [\ref=lemma-plane-thru-tinfty], no line through V can contain 2 points of C, hence C' contains q2 distinct points. We consider this projection in the two cases: when V is a 0-point, and when V is an ∞  -point.

Case 1: Suppose V is a 0-point, we will show that the set [formula] is an elliptic quadric in Σ. Further, each C-plane projects to a unique affine plane of Σ through π∞, and conversely, each affine plane of Σ through π∞ is the image of a unique C-plane.

We first show that [formula] is a cap of Σ. By Lemma [\ref=l-meets-Pinfty], a plane meeting t∞ in the 0-point V meets C in at most 2 points. Hence no three points of C' are collinear (otherwise their preimages would be coplanar with V). Further, if the point π∞ were collinear with two points B',C' of C', then their preimages B,C∈C would lie in a plane about t∞, which is not possible by Lemma [\ref=lemma-plane-thru-tinfty]. So [formula] is a set of q2 + 1 points, no three collinear in a 3-space of order q, q odd. Hence E is an elliptic quadric, see [\cite=barl55] or [\cite=pane55]. Now let α be a C-plane. As V is a 0-point, α meets t∞ in a point distinct from V, and so α projects to an affine plane α' through π∞. Let α,β be two distinct C-planes with images α',β' respectively. If α' = β', then as α,β together contain at least 2q - 1 C-points, the plane α' contains 2q - 1 points of the elliptic quadric E, a contradiction. As there are q2 + q C-plane s and q2 + q affine planes in Σ through π∞ (that is, planes not contained in Σ ∞ ), each C-plane projects to a unique affine plane of Σ through π∞, and conversely. This completes the proof of the statement at Case 1.

Recall that [formula] meets the spread lines [formula], we now consider the corresponding C-points Ai, and their images Ai' under the projection from V. By Lemma [\ref=l-meets-Pinfty], the plane [formula] contains exactly one C-point, namely Ai. Let [formula], so L∈Σ ∞  as [formula]. The plane [formula] projects to the line LAi' which contains exactly one point of C', namely Ai', hence these lines are distinct for distinct i. As Σ ∞  contains no C-point s, the projection [formula] of Σ ∞  from V onto Σ is a tangent plane to E, so Lπ∞ is a tangent line to E. Thus from a point L∈Σ we have a set [formula] of q + 1 tangent lines of E. As E is an elliptic quadric, the points [formula] all lie on a plane β', namely the polar plane of L, see [\cite=hirs85]. Hence by the above argument, β' is the image of a C-plane β, and hence the points Ai lie on a common C-plane, namely β. So the lemma holds in the case [formula] is a 0-point.

Case 2: Suppose V is an ∞  -point. We will show that the set C' can be completed to a hyperbolic quadric H with the addition of two lines through π∞ in [formula]. Further, the C-plane s are of two types: the C-plane s through V project to the generator lines of H not through π∞; and the C-plane s not through V project to planes through π∞ which meet H in a conic.

A C-plane through V is projected onto a line of Σ not through π∞. By Lemma [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](2), there are two parallel classes [formula] of C-plane s through V, and C-plane s in the same parallel class pairwise meet in exactly V. Hence one parallel class [formula] through V is mapped to a set T1 of q mutually skew lines (each line containing q points of C'), and the other parallel class [formula] through V is mapped to a set T2 of q mutually skew lines (each line containing q points of C'), with each line from T1 meeting every line from T2 in a point of C'. We complete these line sets into a regulus and its opposite regulus as follows. Consider the parallel class [formula] of C-plane s through V. By Lemma [\ref=cplane-parallel-classes], the C-line s of these C-plane s lie in a common plane of Σ ∞  through t∞. Hence they all meet [formula] in collinear points on a line [formula] through π∞. The line [formula] meets every C-plane in [formula], and so meets every line in T1. Similarly we have a line [formula] through π∞ corresponding to the parallel class [formula], and [formula] meets every line in T2. Thus the lines [formula] form a regulus with opposite regulus [formula]. Hence [formula] is a hyperbolic quadric in Σ. So we have shown that the 2q C-plane s through V project to 2q lines of the hyperbolic quadric H. The remaining q2 - q C-plane s not through V project to planes through π∞ that contain q points of C', hence meet H in a conic. Note that the remaining 2q + 1 planes through π∞ meet H in two lines of H, with one of the lines necessarily a line through π∞. This proves the statement for Case 2.

Recall that [formula] meets the spread lines [formula], we now consider the corresponding C-points Ai, and their images Ai' under the projection from V. If [formula] is a C-line, then the C-points [formula] lie on a common C-plane by Corollary [\ref=cor:tA]. So suppose [formula] is not a C-line. By Lemma [\ref=l-meets-Pinfty], the plane [formula] contains exactly one C-point, namely Ai. So πi is mapped to a line through the points Ai' and [formula]. Note that LAi' meets C' in exactly one point, namely Ai'. The lines [formula] are distinct tangent lines to H. Further, Lπ∞ is a tangent line to H. Thus from a point [formula] we have a set of q + 1 tangent lines of H. Hence the points [formula] all lie on a plane through π∞ which meets H in a conic, namely the polar plane of L, see [\cite=hirs85]. Hence by the above argument, this plane is the image of a C-plane, and hence the points Ai lie on a common C-plane. That is, the lemma also holds in the case when V is an ∞  -point.

We now show that any regulus containing t∞ and two other lines of the spread S is contained in S. Next we will use the Klein quadric to show that a spread with this property is regular.

Let tA,tB be two elements of the spread S. Then the unique regulus determined by the three lines t∞,tA,tB is contained in S.

Let tA,tB be two elements of the spread S. Through each point Vi∈t∞, [formula], there is a unique line [formula] that meets both tA and tB. Further, the lines [formula] form a regulus R'. The opposite regulus R is the unique regulus containing t∞,tA,tB. We want to show that R  ⊂  S.

Consider the C-points A,B corresponding to tA,tB respectively. By (A2), they lie in a unique C-plane π. Now π meets Σ ∞  in a C-line  [formula], and [formula] meets t∞ by Lemmas [\ref=cplane-meet-theorem](1) and [\ref=thm-tinfty]. Further [formula] meets tA and tB by Corollary [\ref=cor:tA]. Hence [formula] is one of the lines [formula]. Now [formula] meets q + 1 lines of the spread S, denote them [formula]. We want to show that these are the lines of R. Note that the corresponding C-points [formula] lie on the C-plane π by Corollary [\ref=cor:tA].

Now consider the line [formula], [formula], it meets q + 1 lines of the spread S, denote these by [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=proj-result], the corresponding C-points [formula] lie on a common C-plane, α say. As there is a unique C-plane containing A,B, we have α  =  π, and so [formula]. Hence each line [formula] in the regulus R' meets the spread lines [formula], and so [formula], and so R  ⊂  S. That is, the unique regulus containing t∞,tA,tB is contained in S.

To prove that S is a regular spread we now show that a spread satisfying the conditions of Lemma [\ref=partial-spread] is regular. We will use the Klein correspondence from the set of lines in [formula] to the set of points of the Klein quadric H5, a hyperbolic quadric in [formula]. For details of this correspondence, see [\cite=hirs85]. We note that a regular spread of [formula] corresponds under the Klein correspondence to a 3-dimensional elliptic quadric contained in H5, that is, the intersection of H5 and a 3-space that forms an elliptic quadric. Further, a regulus of [formula] corresponds to a conic in H5.

Let S be a spread of [formula] with a special line t∞ with the property that the regulus containing t∞ and any further two lines of S is contained in S. Then S is a regular spread.

We begin with some notation. Let S' be the points on the Klein quadric H5 corresponding to the lines of the spread S. For each line tA of S, let tA' denote the corresponding point of H5. Similarly, if R is a regulus of [formula], let R' denote the set of points of H5 corresponding to the lines of R, and note that the points in R' lie on a conic. For three mutually skew lines [formula] in [formula], let [formula] denote the unique regulus containing them.

We first show that all the points of S' are contained in a common 3-space. We will repeatedly use the assumption that the regulus determined by t∞ and two other lines of S is contained in S.

Fix a spread element tA  ≠  t∞ and consider any two distinct reguli R1,R2 of S containing t∞ and tA. Suppose that

[formula]

Two distinct reguli have at most two common lines, so R1 and R2 intersect in exactly t∞,tA. Hence in the Klein quadric, we have two conics R1',R2', they lie in two distinct planes which meet in the line t∞'tA' and hence span a 3-space denoted Σ. Now consider the regulus T of S determined by t∞,tB1,tC1:

[formula]

Note that the lines tBi,tCj,tDk are all distinct. In [formula], T' is a conic that contains three points t∞',tB1',tC1' of Σ, hence T'  ⊂  Σ.

We now use the lines [formula] of T to construct q - 3 + 1 more reguli of S through t∞,tA:

[formula]

We have a set [formula] of q reguli of S that pairwise intersect in exactly the lines t∞,tA, so they cover 2 + q(q - 1) = q2 - q + 2 elements of S. The remaining q - 1 spread elements [formula] of S lie on a common regulus U through t∞,tA (as every three elements determine a unique regulus), that is,

[formula]

Now each reguli Ri, [formula], is mapped to a conic Ri' of H5. Further each conic Ri', [formula] contains three points t∞',tA',tDi' of Σ. Hence Ri'  ⊂  Σ, [formula]. To show that S'  ⊂  Σ, it remains to show that [formula].

Now consider the two reguli R1, U of S. They map to two conics R1',U' of H5 that span a 3-space denoted by Σ'. Consider another regulus of S:

[formula]

Then V' is a conic of H5 with three points t∞',tB1',tE1' in Σ', and so V' is contained in Σ'. As U,V meet exactly in t∞,tE1, the lines tFi, [formula] are distinct from the lines tEi, [formula] and so belong to the q2 - q + 2 elements of S in Σ. Hence we have tFi  ⊆  Σ and so [formula], [formula]. Thus [formula] contains R1' and V' which is more than a plane, and so Σ  =  Σ'. That is, [formula]. Thus the lines of S are mapped into points of H5 that lie in a 3-space Σ.

The intersection Q of the 3-space Σ with H5 is a quadric of Σ, hence is either an elliptic, hyperbolic or a degenerate quadric. Note that in all cases other than the elliptic quadric, Q does not correspond to a spread (or a set containing a spread) of [formula]. Hence Q is an elliptic quadric, and so S is a regular spread.

As an immediate consequence of Lemma [\ref=partial-spread] and Theorem [\ref=Sisregular], we have that the spread S constructed in Theorem [\ref=lines-form-a-spread] is regular.

The spread [formula] is regular.

C gives rise to an arc in [formula]

By Corollary [\ref=cor:regular-spread], we have a regular spread [formula] in Σ ∞  from which we can construct a Desarguesian plane [formula] via the Bruck-Bose correspondence. Let O be the set of points in P(S) corresponding to the affine points of C together with the point T∞ on [formula] corresponding to the spread line t∞.

O is a conic in [formula].

We show that [formula] is a (q2 + 1)-arc in [formula], and hence a conic. A line through T∞ in [formula] corresponds to an affine plane of [formula] that contains the spread line t∞. By Lemma [\ref=lemma-plane-thru-tinfty], the affine planes of [formula] through t∞ meet C in exactly one point. Hence in [formula], a line through T∞ meets O in at exactly one further point.

Let tA be a line of the spread S in [formula] with corresponding C-point A. Let α be an affine plane of [formula] through the spread line tA that contains three C-points P,Q,R. We obtain a contradiction to show that this is not possible. Note that α  ≠  〈A,tA〉 since by Corollary [\ref=cor:tA2], the plane 〈A,tA〉 contains exactly one C-point. By (A2), P,Q lie in a unique C-plane πPQ which meets tA in the point [formula]. Hence by Corollary [\ref=cor:tA], πPQ contains the point A. Similarly, P,R lie on a unique C-plane πPR that contains A. Hence we have two distinct C-plane s πPQ,πPR that both contain the two distinct points A,P of C, contradicting (A2). Hence any affine plane that contains a spread line tA contains at most two points of C. Thus in the Bruck-Bose plane [formula], a line through a point of [formula] meets O in at most two points. Further, [formula] meets O in one point, so we have shown that O is a (q2 + 1)-arc in [formula]. As q is odd, by Segre [\cite=segr55], O is a conic in [formula].

This almost completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm]. It remains to show that the spread S is unique, which we do in the next section.

The spread S is unique

We now show that the spread [formula] constructed in Theorem [\ref=lines-form-a-spread] is the only spread in Σ ∞  for which the C-points give rise to an arc in the Bruck-Bose plane P(S).

Let S' be a spread of Σ ∞  distinct from the spread [formula]. Then in the associated Bruck-Bose plane P(S'), the set of points corresponding to C do not form an arc.

Let [formula] be a line in Σ ∞  disjoint from t∞ and assume that all the affine planes through [formula] meet C in at most two points. We will show that [formula] must be one of the spread lines tA for some point A∈C. Let X1 be a point on [formula], by Lemma [\ref=lem:pttype] and  [\ref=thm-tinfty], there exists a unique C-line [formula] through X1. By Corollary [\ref=count-cline], [formula] is contained in a unique C-plane π1. Let E1 be the conic in π1, that is, [formula]. Now X1 is on one tangent to E1, namely [formula], hence X1 is on a second tangent m1 to E1. There are (q - 1) / 2 2-secants to E1 through X1, each together with the line [formula] determines an affine plane, we label these planes [formula]. As each plane contains a 2-secant to E1 through X1, each contains at least two C-point s, and hence by our assumption about [formula], contains exactly two C-point s.

Similarly, let X2 be a point on [formula], lying on a unique C-line [formula], defining the unique C-plane π2, and construct planes [formula] which contain [formula] and exactly two C-point s. Suppose α  =  αi  =  βj for some i,j. Then α contains at least three C-points (as αi contains a 2-secant of C through X1, βj contains a 2-secant of C through X2, and X1  ≠  X2). This contradicts our assumption that planes about [formula] contain at most two C-points. Hence the planes [formula] are distinct, and cover (q - 1)  ×  2 distinct C-points.

Repeating this for the remaining points [formula] of [formula], we obtain a set K of distinct planes about [formula] (including the αi,βj) of size (q + 1)  ×  (q - 1) / 2. Each plane in K contains exactly two C-point s, accounting for q2 - 1 points of C that lie on planes through [formula].

Now for each i, consider the unique affine tangent line mi through Xi (distinct from [formula]) to the conic Ei, in the plane πi. We have a set of q + 1 planes [formula], not necessarily distinct, but distinct from the planes of K, each meeting C in at least one point. However, there is only one C-point unaccounted for by the planes of K, so the planes [formula] are all the same plane α which contains exactly one point Z of C. The q + 1 lines [formula] through Z in α are respectively the tangents [formula] to the conic [formula] in [formula] at Z. Further, the tangents [formula] meet Σ∞ at points [formula] of [formula], so by Definition [\ref=def:tA], [formula]. That is, [formula] is one of the spread lines of S. We conclude that every line in Σ ∞  which is disjoint from t∞ and not in S lies on an affine plane that contains at least three C-point s.

Suppose S' is a spread of Σ ∞  distinct from S such that in the Bruck-Bose plane P(S') the C-points form an arc. Let [formula] denote the set of lines in S' that are not in S. If [formula] contains a line [formula] disjoint from t∞, then by the above argument, [formula] lies on some affine plane α that contains at least three C-points. In the Bruck-Bose plane P(S'), α corresponds to a line that contains three C-points, so C is not an arc, contradicting our assumption. Hence [formula] cannot contain a line [formula] disjoint from t∞, thus the lines in [formula] must meet t∞. So if S'  ≠  S, then [formula] contains q + 1 lines that meet t∞ in a point. Let [formula], so [formula] meets t∞ and another q spread lines [formula] of S. Let [formula], then the lines of [formula] cover the same points as the lines of R do. Let [formula], then each line [formula] meets each line in R.

Let tA, tB be any two lines of R distinct from t∞. There are exactly q + 1 lines meeting t∞,tA,tB, and since [formula] meet each of t∞,tA,tB, they form a regulus R'. A similar argument with three elements of R' shows that R is the opposite regulus of R'. By Corollary [\ref=cor:tA], there exists a unique C-line m meeting t∞,tA,tB, namely the C-line  corresponding to the unique C-plane πAB through A and B. The line m meets three lines of R and hence it is a line of R'. That is, m is a line of S'. However, the C-plane πAB through m corresponds to a line of P(S') that contains q points of C. Hence C is not an arc of P(S'). Thus the only spread which gives rise to an arc in the corresponding Bruck-Bose plane is the regular spread S constructed in Theorem [\ref=lines-form-a-spread].

This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm].

Conclusion

In this paper we characterised sets in [formula], q odd, q  ≥  7 satisfying the combinatorial properties given in Theorem [\ref=mainthm] as corresponding via the Bruck-Bose correspondence to conics in [formula]. We note that a similar characterisation when q is even is given in [\cite=conicqeven]. The cases when q = 3 or 5 are still open.

An interesting geometric question arises from the properties of a conic given in Lemma [\ref=conic-satisfies-props]. Let C be a conic in [formula], q odd, tangent to [formula], and let π be a C-plane. By property 3 of Lemma [\ref=conic-satisfies-props], the points of π that are not in C lie on exactly one more C-plane. Let P be a point of [formula]. If P is an interior point of the subconic [formula], then we can use the polarity of [formula] to construct the second C-plane containing P. If P is an exterior point of [formula], then it would be interesting to have a geometric construction of the second C-plane containing P.
