Rapid Decay of Color Gauge Fields by Production of Magnetic Monopoles

introduction

One of the most significant unsolved puzzles in the dynamics of quarks and gluons in high energy heavy ion collisions is how coherent color gauge fields[\cite=cgc] ( here we call them glasma ) generated immediately after the collisions decay into quark gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, the fields rapidly decay and produce thermalized QGP within a time less than 1fm/c[\cite=hirano]. The puzzle is what kind of mechanism causes such a rapid decay of the glasma.

The presence of such coherent gauge fields has been shown using a model of color glass condensate[\cite=cgc]. They are color electric and magnetic fields pointed in longitudinal direction. They are uniform in the longitudinal direction, while they vary in transverse directions. Thus, we may think that they have the form of flux tubes with various widths. The typical width is given by Q- 1s; Qs is saturation momentum in the collisions. Similarly, the typical values of the gauge field strength are given by Q2s.

Instabilities of such gauge fields have been shown in numerical simulations[\cite=berges] [\cite=berges1] [\cite=kunihiro] [\cite=ven] [\cite=fuku]. It has been found that small fluctuations added to the gauge fields grow exponentially. Consequently, the longitudinal pressure of gauge fields or the distance between classical trajectories in space of gauge fields grow exponentially. The presence of the instabilities implies that the gauge fields decay with entropy production[\cite=kunihiro] and indicates that they eventually produce QGP. However, the life time of the gauge field caused by the instabilities is much longer than 1fm/c.

The instabilities have been shown to be Nielsen-Olesen instability[\cite=nielsen] [\cite=instability]. Actually, the authors of the paper[\cite=berges2] has demonstrated numerically in detail that they are Nielsen-Olesen instabilities, not Weibel instabilities. Nielsen and Olesen have shown in their original paper[\cite=nielsen] that there exist unstable modes growing exponentially with time ~   exp (γt) under homogeneous color magnetic field B. Their growth rate γ is given by [formula]; g    ( > 0) is a gauge coupling constant. Since the magnetic fields in the glasma are inhomogeneous, unstable modes grow more slowly than in the case of the homogeneous magnetic field. Indeed, γ is given by not square root [formula] of magnetic fields, but square root [formula] of effective magnetic field [formula], which is much smaller than Q2s, e.g. [formula]. That is, because gB varies spatially and temporally, the average growth rate of the unstable modes is much small compared with that in the case of homogeneous magnetic fields. Furthermore, the growth rates[\cite=ven] [\cite=fuku] [\cite=berges1] in expanding glasma are much smaller than those in non-expanding glasma, because background magnetic fields become weak with the expansion[\cite=lap]. Therefore, the life time of the glasma caused by the instabilities is longer than 1fm/c. This contradicts the phenomenological analysis, which shows that thermalized QGP is realized within a time less than 1fm/c.

Magnetic monopoles[\cite=coleman] are essential ingredients for quark confinement. Their condensation realizes a confining vacuum of dual superconductor[\cite=dual]. They have "imaginary mass" so that the fields representing monopoles exponentially increase just like Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. The mass is homogeneous and its absolute value is of the order of 1GeV[\cite=dual] [\cite=koma]. Furthermore, magnetic charge gm = 2π / g is large for small gauge coupling [formula] in high energy heavy ion collisions. Hence, we may expect that the monopoles are enormously produced in the collisions and their production causes a rapid decay of the glasma.

In this paper we show that the glasma rapidly decays by the production of the magnetic monopoles. The production arises by the Schwinger mechanism and its back reaction to background color magnetic fields causes the fields decay. The calculation is performed by using classical statistical field theory[\cite=csft] [\cite=csft1] [\cite=csft2]. Thus, we take into account one loop quantum effects of monopole fields in the calculation. We find that the life time of the color magnetic fields is much shorter than 1fm/c. For comparison, we also calculate the back reaction of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes by using classical statistical field theory. We find that the glasma decays ten times faster by the production of the monopoles than by the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. Although we only treat non-expanding glasma, our result does hold even in expanding glasma.

In next section [\ref=2], we explain the presence of Nielsen-Olesen instabilities under inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In section [\ref=3], after discussing monopole production by dual Schwinger mechanism, we show that magnetic fields rapidly decay by the monopole production. Discussions and conclusions follow in section [\ref=4]

Nielsen-Olesen instability in inhomogeneous magnetic fields

First, we briefly review the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes found in the previous numerical simulations. In particular, we show that they are present in any inhomogeneous background magnetic fields and argue why the growth rates of the unstable modes are much smaller in inhomogeneous magnetic fields than those in homogeneous magnetic fields. Although the glasma involves the inhomogeneous magnetic fields, we can describe the properties of the instabilities by using effective homogeneous magnetic fields.

We consider SU(2) gauge theory with the background color electric and magnetic fields given by [formula] and [formula]. Here we assume for simplicity that these fields are pointed into 3 direction of color space. The fields are represented by the gauge potential [formula]. Under the background fields, the gauge potentials [formula] perpendicular to A3μ behave as charged vector fields. When we represent SU(2) gauge potentials Aaμ using the variables Aμ and Φμ, Lagrangian of SU(2) gauge potentials is written in the following,

[formula]

with Fμ,ν  =  ∂μAν  -  ∂νAμ and Dμ  =  ∂μ + igAμ. We may understand that the fields Φμ represent charged vector fields with the anomalous magnetic moment described by the term [formula]. This term gives rise to the instability of the background magnetic field.

For example, when a homogeneous background magnetic field is given by B = ∂1A2  -  ∂2A1, but E = 0, the particles represented by the fields Φi occupy the Landau levels denoted by integer N  ≥  0. Their energies are given by [formula], where ±   denotes magnetic moment parallel ( -   ) or anti-parallel ( +   ) to [formula] and p3 denotes a momentum component parallel to [formula]. Among them the energies of the states in the lowest Landau level ( N = 0 ) with the magnetic moment parallel to [formula] can be imaginary; [formula] with p23 < gB. Thus, the modes with the imaginary energies exponentially increase or decrease with time; [formula]. The modes are called as Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. In particular, the mode with p3 = 0 increases most rapidly with the growth rate [formula].

The "kinetic energy" ( the second term of the Lagrangian ) of the states in the lowest Landau level is given by + gB as usual, while the "potential energy" given by the anomalous magnetic moment ( the third term ) is negative, that is given by - 2gB. Thus, the "total energy" E2 is given such that gB - 2gB =  - gB < 0. This leads to the imaginary energy [formula].

The case of the homogeneous magnetic field is not realistic. Magnetic fields in the glasma have the form of flux tubes and oscillate according to the Maxwell equations. Then, the "potential energy" ( - 2gB ) varies spatially and oscillates, in other words, the potential can be negative or positive. Although their typical energy scale is given by the saturation momentum Qs, the average depth of the potential is not of the order of Q2s, but much less than Q2s. Hence we may ask whether or not states with negative "total energies" are present even in such cases. That is, we ask whether or not the instabilities caused by the "potential" are still present. We should remember that the numerical simulations have shown the presence of the instabilities.

We can analytically show the presence of the instability even in the inhomogeneous magnetic fields. In order to see it we write down the Hamiltonian of the field Φi,

[formula]

where we neglected the interaction terms ~  g2Φ4i and used a gauge Φ0 = 0. The third term represents the anomalous magnetic moment of the field Φi. Obviously, the equations of motion of Φi, is given such that [formula]. We can show that for arbitrarily given [formula], there are field configurations Φi such that [formula]. The fact implies that negative eigenvalues E2 < 0 ( [formula] ) are present for arbitrarily given [formula].

In order to find such field configurations, we put Φi = DiΦ and rewrite

[formula]

with [formula], where we assumed that the field Φ vanishes at spatial infinity and used the identity DiDj - DjDi = igFi,j.

In the last equation, we can take an appropriate continuous function θ such that the function [formula] is negative at a point P. Then, from the continuity of the fields there is a region involving the point P in which [formula] is still negative. We can take a field configuration |Φ| such that |Φ| is sufficiently small outside the region for the integral [formula] to be negative. Therefore, we find such field configurations Φi that the integral [formula] is negative. In this way we can see that there are negative eigenvalues E2 for arbitrarily given B. This is the reason why instabilities have been found in the previous numerical simulations.

We should note that the integral cannot take arbitrarily large negative values because we should take sufficiently small Φi for the quartic interactions g2Φ4i to be neglected. Thus, our arguments do not show the presence of arbitrarily large negative eigenvalues E2.

Rigorously speaking, in order for the eigenvalues to exist, the Hamiltonian has to be static. But, because the background magnetic field B varies with time, H depends on time. What we have shown above is that there exist such eigenstates Φi that [formula] with E(t)2 < 0. This implies that the instability is present: From the equation of motion -  ∂2tΦi = E(t)2Φi with E(t)2 < 0, we can see that the field Φi increases endlessly because a particle with its coordinate Φi rolls down the slope given by E(t)2|Φi|2 < 0.

We have found that even if gB varies spatially or temporally, the instability arises owing to the potential term ( - 2gB ). The growth rate of the unstable modes is, however, much smaller than that in the case of homogeneous gB. The small growth rate can be represented by using effective homogeneous magnetic field [formula]; [formula]. This effective gauge field gives rise to the imaginary "mass" [formula] of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes so that the modes increase exponentially. The fact can be described by the following effective Lagrangian of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes [formula],

[formula]

where homogeneous background magnetic field is described by [formula]. The numerical simulations of non-expanding glasma show that [formula] is about (1  ~  2)  ×  10- 1Qs. Furthermore, we assumed that the effect of the inhomogeneous electric field is also described by using the effective homogeneous electric field, [formula].

monopole production and rapid decay of glasma

It is generally believed that magnetic monopoles in QCD play the role in confining quarks. They condense in vacuum and form dual superconductors in which color electric flux is squeezed. In lattice gauge theories, we can see such a role of the magnetic monopoles with the use of maximal Abelian gauge. Furthermore, effective theories of dual superconductors have been explored[\cite=koma] in which magnetic monopoles are described by a complex scalar field. In the theories we have dual gauge fields Adi which couple minimally with the monopole field. Electric and magnetic fields are described such that Ei  =  εi,j,k∂jAdk and Bi =  - ∂0Adi  -  ∂iAd0, respectively. We assume an effective model of the dual superconductor used to see the effects of the monopoles in high energy heavy ion collisions. ( The roles of their effects in thermalized QGP have also been discussed; for instance, small viscosity of QGP would be caused by the monopoles[\cite=vis]. )

Now, we consider the production of magnetic monopoles and their back reaction to the background magnetic field by using classical statistical field theory. These monopoles are produced by the color magnetic fields owing to Schwinger mechanism[\cite=sch].

Effective Lagrangian of the monopole field φ are given by

[formula]

with [formula], where [formula] denotes magnetic charge ( = 2π / g ) of the monopoles. Phenomenologically the parameter m approximately takes a value of the order of 1GeV�� [\cite=koma]. Obviously, the mass is homogeneous ( independent of space-time ). In this section we consider the effective homogeneous background gauge fields [formula] and [formula] mentioned above.

Here, we note a similarity between the monopoles in eq([\ref=MO]) and the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes in eq({[\ref=NO]). They occupy the Landau levels under the electric ( magnetic ) field. The monopoles possess the imaginary mass [formula], while the unstable modes possess the imaginary "mass" [formula]. They are produced by Schwinger mechanism; monopoles ( Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes ) under magnetic ( electric ) field. Both of them are described by the scalar fields; more precisely, scalar field in the monopoles and scalar-like field in the unstable modes ( only the component of the vector field with the magnetic moment parallel to [formula] ).

First, by using the standard formulae[\cite=tanji] [\cite=ita] of the Schwinger mechanism, we compare the production rate of the monopoles with that of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. The production rate is proportional to the number of the particles produced in unit volume. The production rate of the monopole under the magnetic field [formula] is given by [formula], where we assumed that the monopoles occupy the lowest Landau level. On the other hand, the production rate[\cite=ita] of Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes is given by [formula]. ( The energy of the lowest Landau level is given by [formula] for the monopoles, while [formula] for the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. Hence the production rate of the monopoles can be obtained in the similar way to the one[\cite=ita] in Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes.)

Hereafter, for definiteness, we use the parameters m = 0.7 GeV, Qs = 2 GeV, αs(Qs) = 1 / 3 and [formula] ( the value [formula] has been estimated using the results in the numerical simulation[\cite=berges4] ). Then, [formula] with [formula].

We assume that [formula] which holds just after the heavy ion collisions. Then, we find that the production rate [formula] of the monopoles is about 10 times larger than the rate [formula] of Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes; r(m) / r(N) =  exp (0.8π)≃12. This means that the number of the monopoles produced is 10 times larger than the number of Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. In the estimation, the back reaction of the particle production to the background gauge fields is not taken into account.

Now, we consider the back reaction of the monopole production by using classical statistical field theory[\cite=csft2]. We assume homogeneous color magnetic [formula] and electric fields [formula]. Under the background electric field, the states of the magnetic monopoles are characterized by Landau levels. Among them, we only consider the production of the monopoles in the lowest Landau level whose wavefunctions are given by

[formula]

with [formula] and integer n  ≥  0 where we used a gauge potential [formula]. The states are localized in transverse space. But, by taking the appropriate linear combination of the wavefunctions we can form almost homogeneous field configurations in the transverse plane. Then, their magnetic currents Jm(φ) are also almost homogeneous so that the effects of the back reaction ( [formula] ) to the monopole production is homogeneous. Such field configurations are given by,

[formula]

where c(p3) is a dimensionless function of the longitudinal momentum p3 and [formula]. Each component ψl satisfies the condition, ψlψl'≃δl,l'ψ2l because we impose that [formula]. Namely, a configuration ψl is separated with the nearest neighbors approximately by the distance larger than lE. Furthermore, we assume that the area L2 of the transverse plane is given by L2 = k  Nl2E where k represents how dense the transverse plane is occupied by the field ψl. ( Their number density is given by [formula]. ) In order for our approximation to hold, we should take k such that k is not too small ( k < 1 ) to avoid over dense configuration and not too large ( k > 100 ) to avoid inhomogeneity in the transverse plane. For definiteness, we assume k = 10 so that each field configuration ψl is separated from each others by the distance equal to or larger than ≃3lE. Then, the field configuration φ is approximately homogeneous. This kind of the field configuration was analyzed[\cite=ninomiya] to discuss so called "spaghetti vacuum".

Using the field configuration, we write down the energies of the monopoles and the magnetic field,

[formula]

with [formula], where

[formula]

The color magnetic field is given by [formula] with the homogeneous dual gauge potential [formula]. Here, we assumed that the gauge potential Ad is homogeneous both in the transverse and longitudinal directions. That is, we wish to study how the homogeneous component of the magnetic field produced just after heavy ion collisions decreases by the monopole production. Furthermore, we assume that the quartic term |φ|4 is negligibly small.

Using the Hamiltonian, we can derive the equation of motions of the fields Cp(t),

[formula]

with k = 10, where we have written down a dual Maxwell equation of the gauge field ∂tB = ∂20Ad =  - Jm with the magnetic current [formula]. It describes how the magnetic field decreases by the effect of the magnetic current Jm, which is induced by the monopole production.

To solve the equation, we need to impose initial conditions of Ad and Cp. The initial condition of Ad is given by Ad(t = 0) = 0 and [formula] where B0 is the initial value of the magnetic field; [formula]. On the other hand, we take initial conditions of the monopole field, following the discussion by Dusling et al.[\cite=csft]. By using the initial conditions, we can take into account one loop quantum effects of the monopoles in our classical calculation. The use of the initial conditions is the essence of the classical statistical field theory.

The initial conditions are given in the following,

[formula]

with parabolic cylinder function Dν(z) and [formula], where dp and fp denote Gaussian random variables satisfying

[formula]

The average 〈    〉 over the Gaussian random variables is taken after solving the equations ([\ref=eqm]). We should note that the average 〈|Cp|2〉 is proportional to [formula]. Hence, the factor L in the denominator of Jm is cancelled with that of 〈|Cp|2〉 so that the factor L disappears in eq([\ref=eqm]).

By solving these equations with the initial conditions and [formula], we can find how fast the magnetic field [formula] decays. The decay is caused by the production of the magnetic monopoles.

For comparison, we write down the corresponding equations for Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes, which describe the decay of electric field caused by the production of the unstable modes. The equations are in the following,

[formula]

with [formula] and the initial conditions,

[formula]

with A(t = 0) = 0 and [formula], where dp and fp are the random variables satisfying the above equations ([\ref=random]). ( In the previous paper[\cite=iwazaki] we have used initial conditions for Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes different from the ones used in the present paper. Using the initial conditions in the present paper, we can appropriately take into account of quantum effects of the unstable modes on the background electric field. )

Before solving the above equations, we note that the average 〈  |Cp|2〉 is given such that

[formula]

Then, instead of taking the average over the random variables dp and fp after solving the equations, for simplicity, we use an initial condition,

[formula]

where we have rewritten Cp such that [formula].

In Fig.1 we show how the background color electric field decays by the production of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. Similarly, in Fig.2 we show how the background color magnetic field decays by the production of the magnetic monopoles. We can see that the decay of the magnetic field proceeds very rapidly, about 10 times more rapidly than the decay of the electric field. The difference in the life times of the gauge fields comes from the difference in the initial conditions. Namely, the initial amplitude Cp(t = 0) of the monopole field is much larger than that of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes CNp(t = 0) ( Fig.3 ). Physically, it means that the number of the monopoles produced spontaneously at t = 0 is very large compared with the number of the Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. The difference is consistent with the difference in the production rate of the monopoles and Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes by Schwinger mechanism; the production rate of the monopoles is 10 times larger than that of Nielsen-Olesen unstable modes. Although the field amplitude Cp = 0(t) begins to grow such as [formula] for t > m- 1≃0.3, the magnetic field decays before the start of the growth. Thus, the exponential growth of the amplitude does not contribute to the decay of the magnetic field. It decays mainly due to the large amount of the spontaneous monopole production.

Here we make a comment on the magnetic current Jm in eq([\ref=eqm]). It vanishes at t = 0 because the integrand is antisymmetric in the variable p; Cp(t = 0) = C- p(t = 0). That is, the monopole current is absent at t = 0. Then, the current begins to flow after the spontaneous production of the magnetic monopoles. The strength of the current is determined by the amplitude of the monopoles Cp. This initial large amount of the monopole production causes the magnetic field decay rapidly.

discussions and conclusions

Classical solutions of color magnetic monopoles are unstable unless their stability is guaranteed topologically. Indeed, there are no solutions of stable magnetic monopoles in real QCD. It has been shown[\cite=coleman] that growth rates of unstable modes around classical monopoles can be infinitely large; the rates are proportional to the logarithm of the volume in the system. The fact indicates that the monopoles rapidly decay into gluons after their production. Furthermore, they couple strongly with gluons because the smaller the g, the larger the coupling gm = 2π / g. Therefore, thermalized QGP would be generated immediately after the decay of the background gauge fields.

Background gauge fields used in previous numerical simulations does not involve such classical monopoles, because the background gauge fields are homogeneous in the longitudinal direction. ( The gauge fields produced by monopoles are not homogeneous. ) Thus, only unstable modes with finite growth rates arise in the simulations. If the monopoles are appropriately taken into account in numerical simulations, unstable modes with infinitely large growth rates would be found.

In our calculation background electric fields have been supposed to be static. But, real background electric fields oscillate with time so that magnetic fields are newly generated. Such magnetic fields would rapidly decay by the production of the monopoles. Therefore, the electric fields also decay. That is, the gauge fields in the glasma decays by the monopole production.

We have shown by using classical statistical field theory that the background color magnetic fields of glasma rapidly decay by the production of the color magnetic monopoles. The life time tc is sufficiently short so that the phenomenological constraint ( tc  <  1fm/c ) is satisfied. Although there are several ambiguous numerical factors in our calculation, it shows that the monopoles play important roles in the rapid decay of the glasma.
