Nonnegative rank of a matrix with one negative eigenvalue

The concept of nonnegative rank, equal to the smallest integer r for which a given nonnegative matrix can be written as a product of an m-by-r and an r-by-n nonnegative matrices, provides a useful tool for data analysis, statistics, complexity theory and other applications. Problems related to upper and lower bounds for the nonnegative rank take an important place, and we solve one of those problems posed by Beasley and Laffey in [\cite=BL] by proving the result mentioned in the abstract.

Fix an integer [formula] and take [formula], for i  ≤  k and a small real h1 > 0. Define the 3-by-3 matrix Λ by taking Λrs =  - 1 if {r,s}  =  {2,3} and Λrs = 1 otherwise; the 2k-by-3 matrix B by B2i - 1,1 = B2i,1 = 1, B2i,2 = 14  +  hi, B2i - 1,3 = 6  +  hi, [formula] and [formula]. Then the matrix [formula] is symmetric and has rank 3, and every principal 3-by-3 minor of A is negative as det Λ < 0. So the characteristic polynomial det (A - λI) has either one or three negative roots. The latter is impossible due to the Perron-Frobenius theorem as we have Apq = 0 if {p,q}  =  {2i - 1,2i} for some i and Apq > 0 otherwise. The nonnegative rank of A exceeds log 2k by Proposition 1.3 from [\cite=BL].
