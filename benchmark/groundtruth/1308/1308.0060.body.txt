Integral points on quadratic twists and linear growth for certain elliptic fibrations

Introduction

Rational points on elliptic fibrations

The main goal of this article is to establish sharp bounds for the number of rational points of bounded height on certain del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 defined over [formula]. In their anticanonical embedding, these surfaces are defined by sextic forms in [formula]. More precisely, they are isomorphic to a surface V given by an equation of the shape

[formula]

where the coordinates in [formula] are denoted by (y:x:u:v) to highlight the elliptic fibration and where [formula] are respectively a quartic and a sextic form such that 4F34  +  27F26 is not identically 0.

For [formula], we can choose coordinates [formula] such that for every prime p, either [formula] or [formula] or [formula] or [formula]. Then we can define an exponential height function [formula] by setting For any Zariski open subset U of V, we can introduce the number of rational points of bounded height on U, that is A conjecture of Manin (see [\cite=MR974910]) predicts the asymptotic behaviour of NV,H(B) as B tends to +    ∞  , but the current technology is very far from allowing us to approach it for any surface V. A weaker version states that V has linear growth, by which we mean that there should exist an open subset U of V such that, for any fixed ε  >  0,

[formula]

The only authors who have addressed this problem seem to be Munshi (see [\cite=MR2326487] and [\cite=MR2429642]) and Mendes da Costa (see [\cite=MdC]).

More precisely, Mendes da Costa established that for any surface V given by an equation of the shape [\eqref=equation_dP1], there exists δ  >  0 such that NV,H(B)  ≪  B3  -  δ, where the constant involved in the notation ≪   is independent of the forms F4 and F6. This bound is far from the expectation [\eqref=Manin] but is not at all trivial, which illustrates the difficulty of this problem in general.

As already remarked by Munshi, it is easier to deal with certain specific examples of singular surfaces. The most striking result in Munshi's works is the following (see [\cite=MR2429642]). Let [formula] be the surface defined by

[formula]

where [formula], λ is a generator of the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field, and [formula] is a positive definite quadratic form. Then we have

[formula]

where [formula] is defined by removing from [formula] the subset defined by y  =  0. Although impressive, this result is still far from the conjectured upper bound [\eqref=Manin].

Let [formula] be three distinct integers and set [formula]. We also let [formula] be a non-degenerate quadratic form. In this article, we are interested in the surfaces [formula] defined by

[formula]

We let [formula] be the open subset defined by removing from [formula] the two subsets given by y  =  0 and Q(u,v)  =  0. It is straightforward to check that all the surfaces defined by the equations [\eqref=equation_Munshi] or [\eqref=equation_surface] have two singularities of type [formula] over [formula].

Let us note that, all along this article, the constants involved in the notations ≪   and ≫   may depend on ε, [formula] and Q.

The main result of this article is the following.

Let ε  >  0 be fixed. We have the upper bound

As in the works of Munshi, the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper] makes use of the natural elliptic fibration to parametrize the rational points on [formula]. This leads us to investigate the average number of integral points of small naive height on quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic curve with full rational 2-torsion. This is the purpose of section [\ref=Integral_section].

It is worth mentioning that the analysis of the parametrization of the rational points given by Munshi in [\cite=MR2429642] shows that it should be easy to adapt lemma [\ref=geometry_lemma] (see section [\ref=Geometry_section]) to prove that the surfaces defined by [\eqref=equation_Munshi] and considered by Munshi also have linear growth.

Another interesting problem is to prove sharp lower bounds for [formula]. A simpler way to state this is to ask what can be said about the quantity

[formula]

In the following, we choose to take Q(u,v)  =  uv, even though similar results could be proved for other choices of Q. We respectively call [formula] and [formula] the surface and the open subset corresponding to this choice. We establish the following result.

The limit of [formula] as B tends to +    ∞   exists and equals 1. More precisely, we have

[formula]

To prove the lower bound [formula], which is conjecturally best possible, a natural idea is to make use of universal torsors above [formula]. Indeed, this strategy has been successful to establish Manin's conjecture for several examples of singular del Pezzo surfaces of low degree (see [\cite=dP2E7] and [\cite=D4] for the most striking results). Hausen and Süss [\cite=MR2671185] have computed the equations of such a torsor and it turns out that proving this lower bound does not seem to be immediate. It would be interesting to solve this problem.

Integral points of small height on quadratic twists

Given a family of non-rational curves, which is reasonable in some sense, a loose general expectation is that most curves do not have any integral point. Proving results of this flavour is expected to be very hard, even in some simple cases. Another expectation is that the smallest (rational point and a fortiori) integral point on the curves having at least one, is most likely not small. This second statement is easier to approach and the aim of this section is to investigate the case of a family of quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic curve with full rational 2-torsion.

For n  ≥  1, we introduce the elliptic curve [formula] defined by the equation We instantly check that the curves [formula] and [formula] are isomorphic over [formula]. Our interest lies in the set of integral points on [formula], so we set and also The elements of [formula] will be referred to as the non-trivial integral points on [formula].

As already explained, a difficult problem is to obtain upper bounds for the number of n  ≤  N such that [formula] has at least one non-trivial integral point. Following the philosophy described above, it is reasonable to expect that this set has density 0 but the proof of this statement seems to be out of reach.

An easier problem is to investigate properties of integral points of bounded height on the curves [formula] on average over n. Given [formula] with coordinates [formula], we define its exponential naive height H(P) by setting

The following theorem will be the key result in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper]. It gives lower and upper bounds for the number of non-trivial integral points of bounded height on the curves [formula] on average over n.

We have the bounds where [formula] if e1e2e3  ≠  0 and [formula] otherwise.

Note that the interest of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral] mainly lies in the upper bound, and the lower bound implies that it is sharp up to the factor [formula]. Let us note here that with more work, the lower bound could be improved by a factor ( log B)4 but this would not change anything in our other results.

It is not hard to check that there exists an integer n  ≫  B2 for which the set [formula] is not empty. Therefore, the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral] states that most quadratic twists of [formula] do not have a non-trivial integral point of small height.

To be more specific, the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral] allows us to establish the following density statement.

Let A  >  6 be fixed. The set of n  ≥  1 such that every [formula] satisfies has density 1 in the set of n  ≥  1 such that [formula].

It is worth pointing out that it is easy to check that if e1e2e3  ≠  0 then any [formula] has to satisfy H(P)  ≫  n1 / 2, so Corollary [\ref=Corollary_integral] actually holds for any A > 0 in this case.

Outline of the article

We start by establishing Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral]. The proof of this result goes in two steps. The first step consists in using the fact that [formula] has full rational 2-torsion to parametrize the integral points on [formula] using a complete 2-descent. This is achieved in section [\ref=Descent_section]. In the second step, we bound the number of non-trivial integral points of bounded height on the curves [formula] on average over n. To achieve this, we appeal to the recent result of the author [\cite=Bihomogeneous]. This lemma is stated in section [\ref=Geometry_section].

Corollary [\ref=Corollary_integral] straightforwardly follows from the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral] after noticing that the number of n  ≤  N for which the set [formula] is not empty is ≫  N1 / 2.

Finally, we prove Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper] using the natural elliptic fibration and the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral]. Corollary [\ref=Corollary_beta] also follows from this upper bound, together with the lower bound [formula].

Preliminaries

Descent argument

In this section, we derive a convenient parametrization of the integral points on [formula] using the fact that [formula] has full rational 2-torsion. We start by proving the following elementary lemma.

Let [formula] be such that y2  =  x1x2x3. There exists a unique way to write for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3} and where [formula] is subject to the conditions |μ(ai)|  =  1 and gcd (diajbj,djaibi)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j, and d1d2d3  >  0.

Let us set x  =   gcd (x1,x2,x3) and let us write xi  =  xxi' for i∈{1,2,3}, where gcd (x1',x2',x3')  =  1. We see that x|y and we can thus write y  =  xy'. We obtain Let us now set [formula] for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}. Let us note that we have d1d2d3  >  0. We can write xi'  =  djdkξi with ξi  >  0 for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, where gcd (diξj,djξi)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j. Since d1d2d3|y', we can write y'  =  d1d2d3z. We thus get There is a unique way to write ξi  =  aib2i with ai,bi  >  0 and |μ(ai)|  =  1 for i∈{1,2,3}. We see that b1b2b3|z so we can write z  =  b1b2b3z'. We finally obtain Since a1, a2 and a3 are squarefree and pairwise coprime, this implies that we can write x  =  w2a1a2a3 and z'  =  wa1a2a3, which completes the proof.

Lemma [\ref=descent_lemma] immediately implies the following result, which provides us with the desired parametrization of the non-trivial integral points on [formula].

There is a bijection between the set of non-trivial integral points on [formula] and the set of [formula] satisfying, for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, the equations and the conditions |μ(ai)|  =  1 and gcd (diajbj,djaibi)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j, and d1d2d3  >  0. This bijection is given, for [formula] with coordinates [formula], by

[formula]

for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}.

Geometry of numbers

The following lemma follows from the recent work of the author [\cite=Bihomogeneous]. It draws upon both geometry of numbers and analytic number theory tools, and will be the key result in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral].

Let [formula] be a vector satisfying the conditions gcd (fi,fj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j, and let Ui,Vi  ≥  1 for i∈{1,2,3}. Let also [formula] be the number of vectors [formula] and [formula] satisfying |ui|  ≤  Ui, |vi|  ≤  Vi for i∈{1,2,3}, and the equation and such that gcd (uivi,ujvj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j. Let ε  >  0 be fixed. We have the bound where

Integral points of small height on quadratic twists

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral]

Let us first prove the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral]. Lemma [\ref=parametrization] asserts that [formula] satisfies the equation

[formula]

if and only if x and y can be written, for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, as

[formula]

where [formula] satisfies, for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, the equations

[formula]

and the conditions |μ(ai)|  =  1 and gcd (diajbj,djaibi)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j, and d1d2d3  >  0. The equations [\eqref=equations_n] can have a solution [formula] only if Moreover, since e1, e2 and e3 are distinct, there is at most one such solution [formula]. The conditions gcd (di,djaibi)  =  1 imply that di|ej  -  ek for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3} so we can write e2  -  e3  =  d1c1, e3  -  e1  =  d2c2 and e1  -  e2  =  d3c3. We obtain the equation Let us call h  =   gcd (c1,c2,c3) and let us write ci  =  hfi for i∈{1,2,3}. We thus have gcd (f1,f2,f3)  =  1. From the two relations d1f1  +  d2f2  +  d3f3  =  0 and

[formula]

we deduce that gcd (fi,fj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j.

From now on, we use the notation [formula]. We let [formula] be the number of [formula] satisfying the equation [\eqref=equation_final], the inequality and the conditions gcd (aibi,ajbj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j. The investigation above shows that where the maximum is taken over [formula] satisfying fi|ej  -  ek for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3} and gcd (fi,fj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j.

We have thus proved that it is sufficient for our purpose to bound the quantity [formula]. To achieve this, for i∈{1,2,3}, we let W,Ai,Bi  ≥  1 run over the set of powers of 2 and we define [formula] as the number of [formula] satisfying the equation [\eqref=equation_final], the conditions W  <  |w|  ≤  2W, Ai  <  ai  ≤  2Ai and Bi  <  bi  ≤  2Bi, and gcd (aibi,ajbj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j. We have where the sum is over W,Ai,Bi  ≥  1, i∈{1,2,3}, satisfying the inequality

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=geometry_lemma] gives the upper bound where Mε(A1,A2,A3) is defined in lemma [\ref=geometry_lemma]. Choosing for instance ε  =  1 / 4 and summing over W using the condition [\eqref=height_1], we finally obtain

[formula]

which completes the first part of the proof of the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral].

Now let us assume that e1e2e3  ≠  0 and let us prove that we can take [formula] in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral]. If n  >  2B2 then, since x  =  ein  +  djdkw2a2iajakb2i for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, |x|  ≤  B2 and e1e2e3  ≠  0, we have |djdk|w2a2iajakb2i  >  B2 for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, but this is in contradiction with |y|  ≤  B3. This implies that [formula] is empty provided that n  >  2B2 so we can assume that n  ≤  2B2. Therefore, for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, we get the conditions

[formula]

We now proceed similarly as in the first case. We let [formula] be the number of [formula] satisfying the equation [\eqref=equation_final], the inequalities [\eqref=3_conditions] and the conditions gcd (aibi,ajbj)  =  1 for i,j∈{1,2,3}, i  ≠  j. Once again, it is sufficient for our purpose to bound [formula], and we have where the sum is over W,Ai,Bi  ≥  1, i∈{1,2,3}, running over the set of powers of 2 and satisfying, for {i,j,k}  =  {1,2,3}, the inequalities

[formula]

Summing over Bi, i∈{1,2,3}, using the conditions [\eqref=height_2], we get

[formula]

as claimed.

Let us now prove the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral]. We can assume by symmetry that e3  >   max {e1,e2}. Let us denote by [formula] the number of [formula] such that

[formula]

We remark that [formula] counts one non-trivial integral point on the curves [formula] for which n can be written as n  =  2(2e3  -  e1  -  e2)w2. Note that 2e3  -  e1  -  e2  >  0 since e3  >   max {e1,e2}. Therefore, we have It is obvious that [formula], which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=Corollary_integral]

We start by proving the following lemma, which gives a lower bound for the number of n  ≤  N such that the curve [formula] has at least one non-trivial integral point.

We have the lower bound

As in the proof of the lower bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral], we can assume that e3  >   max {e1,e2} and thus, if n can be written as n  =  2(2e3  -  e1  -  e2)w2 for some [formula], then the equalities

[formula]

define a non-trivial integral point on [formula]. Noticing that there are ≫  N1 / 2 such integers n  ≤  N completes the proof of the lemma.

It seems likely that the lower bound in lemma [\ref=lemma_lower_bound] could be improved by a few log N factors, but since this slight improvement would not essentially change the statement of Corollary [\ref=Corollary_integral], we have decided not to explore this any further.

Let A  >  6 be fixed. Let NA(N) be the number of n  ≤  N such that there exists [formula] satisfying We have The upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral] implies so lemma [\ref=lemma_lower_bound] shows that [formula], which concludes the proof of Corollary [\ref=Corollary_integral].

Rational points on elliptic fibrations

Proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper]

Recall that [formula] is defined by the equation

[formula]

Thus, we have

[formula]

Since Q is non-degenerate, we have As a result, we get We note that the sum in the right-hand side can be rewritten as Therefore, using twice the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral], we obtain which ends the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper].

Proof of Corollary [\ref=Corollary_beta]

We proceed exactly as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper]. We have Then, if n  ≤  B2, we have

[formula]

and this upper bound also holds if n  >  B2. This shows that As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Theorem_upper], using twice the upper bound in Theorem [\ref=Theorem_Integral], we obtain

[formula]

Now let us prove a lower bound for [formula]. Let us assume by symmetry that e3  >   max {e1,e2} so that 2e3  -  e1  -  e2  >  0, and let us denote by v2(m) the 2-adic valuation of an integer m  ≥  1. Let [formula] be the number of [formula] such that max {|y|1 / 3,|x|1 / 2,|u|,|v|}  ≤  B and which can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] satisfies gcd (w1,(2e3  -  e1  -  e2)w2)  =   gcd (w2,2)  =  1. Since gcd (u,v) = 1 in the parametrization above, it is immediate to check that Since we clearly have [formula], we have obtained the lower bound

[formula]

Let us note that improving this lower bound by a few log B factors would not be hard. However, as already explained in the introduction, proving the lower bound of the expected order of magnitude for [formula] does not seem to be immediate.

Recalling the definition [\eqref=definition_beta] of [formula], we see that the two bounds [\eqref=upper] and [\eqref=lower] complete the proof of Corollary [\ref=Corollary_beta].
