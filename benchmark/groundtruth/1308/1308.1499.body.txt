Ultracompanions of subsets of a group

Introduction

Given a discrete space X, we take the points of βX, the Stone-[formula]ech compactification of X, to be the ultrafilters on X, with the points of X identified with the principal ultrafilters, so [formula] is the set of all free ultrafilters on X. The topology on βX can be defined by stating that the sets of the form [formula], where A is a subset of X, are base for the open sets. We note the sets of this form are clopen and that for any p∈βX and A  ⊆  X, A∈p if and only if [formula]. For any A  ⊆  X, we denote [formula]. The universal property of βX states that every mapping f:X  →  Y, where Y is a compact Hausdorff space, can be extended to the continuous mapping fβ:βX  →  Y.

Now let G be a discrete group. Using the universal property of βG, we can extend the group multiplication from G to βG in two steps. Given g∈G, the mapping

[formula]

extends to the continuous mapping

[formula]

Then, for each q∈βG, we extend the mapping g  ↦  gq defined from G into βG to the continuous mapping

[formula]

The product pq of the ultrafilters p, q can also be defined by the rule: given a subset A  ⊆  G,

[formula]

To describe a base for pq, we take any element P∈p and, for every x∈P, choose some element Qx∈q. Then [formula], and the family of subsets of this form is a base for the ultrafilter pq.

By the construction, the binary operation (p,q)  ↦  pq is associative, so βG is a semigroup, and G* is a subsemigroup of βG. For each q∈βG, the right shift x  ↦  xq is continuous, and the left shift x  →  gx is continuous for each g∈G.

For the structure of a compact right topological semigroup βG and plenty of its applications to combinatorics, topological algebra and functional analysis see  [\cite=b2],  [\cite=b4],  [\cite=b5],  [\cite=b18],  [\cite=b21].

Given a subset A of a group G and an ultrafilter p∈G* we define a p-companion of A by

[formula]

and say that a subset S of G* is an ultracompanion of A if [formula] for some p∈G*.

Clearly,A is finite if and only if [formula] for every p∈G*, and [formula] for each p∈G*.

We say that a subsetA of a group G is [formula] sparse if each ultracompanion of A is finite; [formula] disparse if each ultracompanion of A is discrete.

In fact, the sparse subsets were introduced in  [\cite=b3] with rather technical definition (see Proposition 5) in order to characterize strongly prime ultrafilters in G*, the ultrafilters from [formula].

In this paper we study the families of sparse and disparse subsets of a group, and characterize in terms of ultracompanions the subsets from the following basic classification.

A subset A of G is called [formula] large if G = FA for some finite subset F of G; [formula] thick if, for every finite subset F of G, there exists a∈A such that Fa  ⊆  A; [formula] prethick if FA is thick for some finite subset F of G; [formula] small if [formula] is large for every large subset L; [formula] thin if [formula] is finite for each [formula], e is the identity of G.

In the dynamical terminology  [\cite=b5], the large and prethick subsets are called syndetic and piecewise syndetic respectively. For references on the subset combinatorics of groups see the survey  [\cite=b12].

We conclude the paper with discussions of some modifications of sparse subsets and a couple of open questions.

Characterizations

The implications (i)  ⇒  (ii)  ⇒  (iii) are evident. To prove (iii)  ⇒  (i), we note that the family {(FpA)*:p∈G} is a covering of G*, choose a finite subcovering (Fp1A)*,...,(FpnA)* and put [formula]. Then G* = (FA)* so [formula] is finite and G = HFA for some finite subset H of G. Hence, A is large.

(i) Assume that A is thick. For each finite subset F of G, we put PF  =  {x∈A:Fx  ⊂  A} and form a family [formula]G}. Since A is thick, each subset PF is infinite. Clearly, [formula]. Therefore, P is contained in some ultrafilter p∈G*. By the choice of P, we have, [formula].

On the other hand, let [formula]. We take an arbitrary finite subset F of G. Then [formula] so [formula] for some P∈p. Hence, P  ⊆  A and Fx  ⊂  A for each x∈P.

(ii) follows from (i).

(iii) We note that A is small if and only if A is not prethick and apply (ii).

(iv) follows directly from the definitions of thin subsets and [formula].

For [formula], a subset A of a group G is called n-thin if, for every finite subset F of G, there is a finite subset H of G such that [formula] for every [formula].

We note that [formula] is infinite if and only if there exists p∈G* such that x- 11p,...,x- 1n + 1p∈A*. This observation prove the equivalence (i)  ⇔  (ii).

(ii)  ⇒  (iii) Assume that A is not thin. Then there are a finite subset F of G and an injective sequence (gm)m < ω in G such that [formula]. Passing to subsequences of (gm)m < ω, we may suppose that there exist distinct x1,...,xn + 1∈F such that {x1,...,xn + 1}gm  ⊆  A so [formula] is infinite.

(iii)  ⇒  (i) Assume that [formula] is infinite for some distinct x1,...,xn + 1∈G. Then there is an injective sequence (gm)m < ω in [formula] such that {x- 11,...,x- 1n + 1}gm  ⊂  A so A is not n-thin.

By  [\cite=b7], a subset A of a countable group G is n-thin if and only if A can be partitioned into ≤  n thin subsets. The following statements are from  [\cite=b15]. Every n-thin subset of an Abelian group of cardinality [formula] can be partitioned into ≤  nm + 1 thin subsets. For each [formula] there exist a group G of cardinality [formula], [formula] and a 2-thin subset A of Gwhich cannot be partitioned into m thin subsets. Moreover, there is a group G of cardinality [formula] and a 2-thin subset A of G which cannot be finitely partitioned into thin subsets.

Remind that an ultrafilter p∈G* is strongly prime if [formula].

The equivalence (ii)  ⇔  (iii) was proved in  [\cite=b3].

To prove (i)  ⇔  (ii), it suffices to note that [formula] is infinite if and only if [formula] has a limit point qp, q∈G* in A*.

Assume that A is not sparse. By Proposition [\ref=p5] (iii), there is a countable subset X = {xn:n < ω} of G such that for any n < ω [formula] is infinite. For any n < ω, we pick [formula], put S = {x- 10an,...,x- 1nan:n < ω} and denote by H the subgroup of G generated by [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=p5](iii), [formula] is not sparse in H.

A family I of subsets of a group G is called an ideal in the Boollean algebra PG of all subsets of G if A,B∈I implies [formula], and A∈I, A'  ⊂  A implies A'∈I. An ideal I is left (right) translation invariant if gA∈I (Ag∈I) for each A∈I.

Apply Proposition [\ref=p1].

Recall that an element s of a semigroup S is right cancelable if, for any x,y∈S, xs = ys implies x = y.

By  [\cite=b5], for a countable group G, an ultrafilter p∈G* is right cancelable in βG if and only if p∉G*p. Apply Proposition [\ref=p8]

Assume that [formula] is not disparse and pick p∈G* such that [formula] has a non-isolated point gq. Then either gp∈A* or gp∈B* so gp is non-isolated either in [formula] or in [formula].

To see that dSpG is translation invariant, we apply Proposition [\ref=p1].

For an injective sequence (an)n < ω in a group G, we denote

[formula]

The equivalence (i)  ⇔  (ii) follows from two well-known facts. By  [\cite=b5], for every idempotent q∈G* and every Q∈q, there is an injective sequence (an)n < ω in Q such that FP(an)n < ω  ⊆  Q. By  [\cite=b5], for every injective sequence (an)n < ω in G, there is an idempotent q∈G* such that FP(an)n < ω∈q.

Assume that qg∈A*. Then q(qg) = qg so qg∈G*qg and, by Proposition [\ref=p8], A is not disparse.

Clearly, SpG  ⊆  dSpG. To verify dSpG  ⊆  SmG, we assume that a subset A of G is not small. Then A is prethick and, by Proposition [\ref=p3](ii), there exist p∈G* and a finite subset F of G such that [formula]. Hence, G*p  ⊆  (FA)*. We takean arbitrary idempotent q∈G* and choose g∈F such that qp∈(gA)*. Since q(qp) = qp so q∈G*qp and, by Proposition [\ref=p8](ii), gA is not disparse. By Proposition [\ref=p10] A is not disparse.

To prove that [formula] and [formula], we may suppose that G is countable. We put F0  =  {e} and write G as an union of an increasing chain {Fn:n < ω} of finite subsets.

1. To find a subset [formula], we choose inductively two sequences (an)n < ω, (bn)n < ω in G such that

(1) [formula];

(2) [formula], 0  ≤  i  ≤  j < ω, 0  ≤  k  ≤  m < ω, (i,j)  ≠  (k,m). We put a0 = b0 = e and assume that a0,...,an, b0,...,bn have been chosen. We choose bn + 1 to satisfy [formula], i  ≤  n and

[formula]

Then we pick an + 1 so that

[formula]

After ω steps, we put A = {aibj:0  ≤  i  ≤  j < ω}, choose two free ultrafilters p,q such that {ai:i < ω}∈p, {bi:i < ω}∈q and note that A∈pq. By Proposition [\ref=p5](ii), A∉SpG.

To prove that A∈dSpG, we fix p∈G* and take an arbitrary [formula]. For n < ω, let An  =  {aibj:0  ≤  i  ≤  n,i  ≤  j < ω}. By (1), the set {bj:j < ω} is thin. Applying Proposition [\ref=p3] and Proposition [\ref=p1], we see that An is sparse. Therefore, if An∈q for some n < ω then q is isolated in [formula]. Assume that An∉q for each n < ω. We take an arbitrary [formula] and choose m < ω such that g∈Fm. By (2), [formula] so gq∉A*. Hence, [formula].

2. To find a subset [formula], we choose inductively two sequences (an)n < ω, (bn)n < ω in G such that, for each m < ω, the following statement hold

(3) [formula] We put a0 = e and take an arbitrary [formula]. Suppose that a0,...,am and b0,...,bm have been chosen. We pick bm + 1 so that

[formula]

and choose an + 1 such that

[formula]

[formula]

After ω steps, we put A = FP(an)n < ω. By Proposition [\ref=p11], A∉dSpG. To see that A∈SmG, we use (3) and the following observation. A subset S of a group G is small if and only if [formula] is large for each finite subset F of G.

For each α  <  κ, we fix some bijection [formula], where eα is the identity of Gα. Each element [formula] has the unique representation

[formula]

We put suptg = {α1,...,αn} and let [formula] denotes the set of all finite sequence in [formula]. We define a mapping [formula] by

[formula]

and put Ds = f- 1(s), [formula].

We fix some [formula] and take an arbitrary p∈G* such that p∈D*s. Let s = {n,m1,...,mn}, g∈Ds and i∈suptg. It follows that, for each i < κ, there exists xi∈Gi such that xiHi∈p, where [formula]. We choose i1,...,ik, k < n such that

[formula]

put [formula] and assume that gp∈P* for some [formula]. Then [formula]. Let suptg = {j1,...,jt}, [formula]. Then H∈p but [formula] because |suptgx| > n for each [formula]. In particular, gp∉P*. Hence, p is isolated in [formula].

By Proposition [\ref=p13], every infinite group embeddable in a direct product of countable groups (in particular, every Abelian group) can be partitioned into [formula] disparse subsets.

By [\cite=b9], every infinite group can be partitioned into [formula] small subsets. For an infinite group G, η(G) denotes the minimal cardinality κ such that G can be partitioned into η(G) sparse subsets. By [\cite=b11], if [formula] then η(G) > κ, so Proposition [\ref=p12] does not hold for partition of G into sparse subsets. For partitions of groups into thin subsets see [\cite=b10].

Comments

1. A subset A of an amenable group G is called absolute null if μ(A) = 0 for each Banach measure μ on G, i.e. finitely additive left invariant function μ:PG  →  [0,1]. By [\cite=b6] Proposition [\ref=p5], every sparse subset of an amenable group G is absolute null.

To answer this question in affirmative, in view of Proposition [\ref=p8], it would be enough to show that each ultrafilter p∈G* such that p∉G*p has an absolute null member P∈p. But that is not true. We sketch corresponding counterexample.

We put [formula] and choose inductively an injective sequence (an)n < ω in [formula] such that, for each m < ω and i∈{ - (m + 1),..., - 1,1,...,m + 1}, the following statements hold

[formula]

Then we fix an arbitrary Banach measure μ on [formula] and choose an ultrafilter [formula] such that [formula], [formula] and μ(Q) > 0 for each Q∈q. Let p∈G* be a limit point of the set {an + q:n < ω}. Clearly, μ(P) > 0 for each P∈p. On the other hand, by [formula], the set [formula] is discrete so [formula].

In [\cite=b17] S. Solecki, for a group G, defined two functions σR,σL:PG  →  [0,1] by the formulas

[formula]

where inf  is taken over all finite subsets ofG.

By [\cite=b1] and [\cite=b20], a subset A of an amenable group is absolute null if and only if σR(A) = 0. To answer this question positively it suffices to prove that if σR(A) > 0 then there is [formula] such that [formula]

2. The origin of the following definition is in asymptology (see [\cite=b16], [\cite=b19]). A subset A of a group G is called asymptotically scattered if, for any infinite subset X of A, there is a finite subset H of G such that, for any finite subset F of G satisfying [formula], we can find a point x∈X such that [formula]. By [\cite=b13] and Propositions [\ref=p5] and [\ref=p6], a subset A is sparse if and only if A is asymptotically scattered.

We say that a subset A of G is ultrascattered if, for any p∈G*, the space [formula] is scattered, i.e. each subset of [formula] has an isolated point. Clearly, each disparse subset is ultrascattered. We say that a subset A of G is weakly asymptotically scattered if, for any subset X of A, there is a finite subset H of G such that, for any finite subset F of G satisfying [formula], we can find a point x∈Xsuch that [formula].

3. Let A be a subset of a group G such that each ultracompanion [formula] is compact. We show that A is sparse. In view of Proposition [\ref=p6], we may suppose that G is countable. Assume the contrary: [formula] is infinite for some p∈G*. On one hand, the countable compact space [formula] has an injective convergent sequence. On the other hand, G* has no such a sequence.

4. Let X be a subset of a group G, p∈G*. We say that the set Xp is uniformly discrete if there is P∈p such that [formula] for all distinct x,y∈X.

5. Let F be a family of subsets of a group G, A be a subset of G. We denote [formula]. If F is the family of all infinite subsets of G, δF(A) were introduced in [\cite=b14] under name combinatorial derivation of A. Now suppose that [formula], pick [formula] and note that δp(A) = δq(A). Then δq(A) = (δq(A))- 1q.
