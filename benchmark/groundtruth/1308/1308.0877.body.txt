Rotation number of primitive vector sequences

Introduction

Let [formula] be a sequence of primitive vectors such that εi  =   det(vi,vi + 1)  ≠  0 for all [formula], and let ai  =  ε- 1i - 1ε- 1i det(vi + 1,vi - 1), where v0 = vd and vd + 1 = v1. The rotation number of the sequence [formula] around the origin is defined by where Li is the line segment from vi to vi + 1. The sequence is called unimodular if |εi| = 1 for all [formula]. Recently A. Higashitani and M. Masuda [\cite=Higashitani_and_Masuda] proved the following:

The rotation number of a unimodular sequence [formula] around the origin is given by

When εi = 1 for all i and the rotation number is one, Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] is well known and formulated as [formula]. It can be proved in an elementary way, but interestingly it can also be proved using toric geometry, to be more precise, by applying Nöther's formula to complete non-singular toric varieties of complex dimension two, see [\cite=Fulton]. When εi = 1 for all i but the rotation number is not necessarily one, Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] was proved in [\cite=Masuda] using toric topology. The proof is a generalization of the proof above using toric geometry. The original proof of Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] by Higashitani and Masuda was a slight modification of the proof in [\cite=Masuda] but then they found an elementary proof. Another elementary proof of Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] is given by R. T. Zivaljevic [\cite=Zivaljevic].

Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] does not hold when the unimodularity condition is dropped. In this paper, we give a formula on the rotation number of a (not necessarily unimodular) sequence of primitive vectors [formula] with εi  ≠  0 for all i, see Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. The proof is done by adding primitive vectors in an appropriate way to the given sequence so that the enlarged sequence is unimodular and then by applying Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] to the enlarged unimodular sequence. This combinatorial process, that is, making the given sequence to a unimodular sequence by adding primitive vectors corresponds to resolution of singularity by blow-up in geometry, see [\cite=Fulton].

The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, we state the main theorem and give an example. In Section 3, we discuss Hirzebruch-Jung continued fractions used in our proof of the main theorem. In Section 4, we give a proof of the main theorem.

The main theorem

Let [formula] be a sequence of vectors such that εi  =   det(vi,vi + 1)  ≠  0 for all [formula]. We define v0 = vd and vd + 1 = v1. We assume that each vector is primitive, i.e. its components are relatively prime.

For each [formula], there exists a unique non-negative integer xi < |εi| such that xi and |εi| are relatively prime and is a unimodular matrix.

Let [formula] and [formula]. We assume that εi > 0. Since vi is primitive, there exist [formula] such that ap + bq = 1. Then we have There exists a unique [formula] satisfying - |εi| < cp + dq + n|εi|  ≤  0. So we put xi =  - (cp + dq + n|εi|). Then we have Hence is a unimodular matrix. When εi < 0, we can show that the assertion holds by a similar argument. Since [formula] is primitive, xi and |εi| are relatively prime.

Note that [formula]. Similarly, there exists a unique non-negative integer yi < |εi| such that

[formula]

is a unimodular matrix.

Since xi and |εi| are relatively prime, xi > 0 when |εi|  ≥  2 and xi = 0 when |εi| = 1. For i such that |εi|  ≥  2, let

[formula]

be the Hirzebruch-Jung continued fraction expansion. This continued fraction expansion is unique. We define li = 0 when |εi| = 1.

Let ai  =  ε- 1i - 1ε- 1i det(vi + 1,vi - 1). Then ai satisfies

[formula]

It is easy to check that Dividing both sides by εi - 1εi  =   det(vi - 1,vi) det(vi,vi + 1), we obtain ([\ref=a_i_2]).

The following is our main theorem:

Let [formula] be a sequence of primitive vectors and εi  =   det(vi,vi + 1), ai  =  ε- 1i - 1ε- 1i det(vi + 1,vi - 1). Let xi,yi,li, and n(i)j be the integers defined in Lemma [\ref=x_i], ([\ref=y_i]), and ([\ref=l_i]). Then the rotation number of the sequence [formula] around the origin is given by

[formula]

Let d = 5 and Then we have the following:

So we have

[formula]

Therefore the value ([\ref=formula]) is [formula], while the rotation number of the sequence [formula] in Figure [\ref=fig:one] is clearly one.

Continued fractions

Let m  ≥  2 and x( < m) be a positive integer prime to m, and let be the continued fraction expansion. This continued fraction expansion is unique, and is called a Hirzebruch-Jung continued fraction.

Let m  ≥  2 and x( < m) be a positive integer prime to m, and let be the continued fraction expansion. Let y( < m) be a unique positive integer such that [formula]. Then the following identity holds:

We prove this by induction on l.

If l = 1, then we must have x = 1,n1 = m and y = 1. So the lemma holds when l = 1.

Suppose that l  ≥  2 and the lemma holds for l - 1. We have Since l  ≥  2, we have x  ≥  2. Since the right hand side in the identity above is greater than 1, we have 0 < n1x - m < x. Since m and x are relatively prime, x and n1x - m are relatively prime. Moreover [formula] is a positive integer less than x and [formula]. Hence by the hypothesis of induction, we obtain

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

proving the lemma for l.

The following identity holds:

Let [formula] be the antihomomorphism defined by By Lemma [\ref=continued_fraction_1], we have

[formula]

proving the proposition.

A similar assertion holds for regular continued fractions. Let be a continued fraction expansion, and let y( < m) be a unique positive integer such that [formula]. Then the following identity holds: The proof is similar to Lemma [\ref=continued_fraction_1]. The following identity can be deduced by taking transpose at the identity above:

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]

In this section, we give a proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. We will use the notation in Section 2 freely. We need the following lemma.

For each [formula], the following identity holds:

If |εi| = 1, then xi = yi = li = 0 and the left hand side above is understood to be the identity matrix. Assume |εi|  ≥  2. By Lemma [\ref=x_i], xi and |εi| are relatively prime. Since

[formula]

is a unimodular matrix, xiyi is congruent to 1 modulo |εi|. Therefore the lemma follows from Lemma [\ref=continued_fraction_1].

For [formula], we define

[formula]

Note that both expressions at the right hand side of ([\ref=w]) are equal if 1  ≤  j  ≤  li. By the definition of w(i)j, it follows that

[formula]

for any [formula]. So the sequence

[formula]

is unimodular.

Hence by Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda], the rotation number of [formula] is given by

[formula]

As for the first summand in ([\ref=rotation]), it follows from ([\ref=epsilon]) that

As for the second summand in ([\ref=rotation]), we first observe that it follows from Lemma [\ref=a_i] that

[formula]

So it follows from ([\ref=unimodular]), ([\ref=w]), ([\ref=epsilon]), and Lemma [\ref=xy] that

[formula]

As for the last summand in ([\ref=rotation]), it follows from ([\ref=w]) and ([\ref=epsilon]) that

[formula]

Therefore ([\ref=rotation]) reduces to

[formula]

proving the theorem.

It sometimes happens that a sequence of primitive vectors [formula] is not unimodular but is unimodular with respect to the sublattice of [formula] generated by vectors [formula]. Such a sequence is called an l-reflexive loop and studied in [\cite=Kasprzyk_and_Nill]. Theorem [\ref=Higashitani-Masuda] can be applied to an l-reflexive loop with respect to the sublattice generated by the vectors in the l-reflexive loop, but it is unclear whether the resulting formula can be obtained from Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].
