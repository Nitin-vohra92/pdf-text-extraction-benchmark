Constraints on Hyperluminous QSO Lifetimes via Fluorescent Lyα Emitters at [formula]

Introduction

The extreme luminosities of QSOs make them effective tracers of black hole growth over most of the Universe's history ([formula]) and likewise illuminate the evolution of galaxies and large-scale structure over these cosmological epochs and volumes. In particular, the mass of supermassive black holes is tightly correlated with properties of their host galaxies (e.g. [\citealt=mag98] [\citealt=geb00] [\citealt=fer00]), while QSO clustering properties are well-matched to the expected distribution of dark matter in and out of halos (e.g. [\citealt=sel00] [\citealt=ber02] [\citealt=zeh04]) according to the cosmological standard model.

However, the manner in which QSOs populate and interact with galaxies and dark-matter halos is obscured by the unknown timescales and geometries over which black holes accrete mass and produce substantial radiation. Specifically, the fraction of black holes that can be observed as QSOs depends sensitively on the length of their active phases and whether their emission is isotropic or confined to a narrow solid angle. A short QSO lifetime ([formula]) and/or a small opening angle ([formula]) would indicate that observed QSOs comprise a small fraction of the total population of black holes (and therefore galaxies and dark-matter halos) that will pass through a QSO phase. Furthermore, both the comparison of [formula] to a typical star-formation timescale [formula] Myr and the value of [formula] have deep implications for the mechanisms by which the QSO couples to the ISM in galaxies and produces feedback.

Current estimates of [formula] utilize numerous methods, many of which are described in detail in a review by [\citet=mar04], and in general allow for QSO lifetimes in the range 106 yr [formula] yr. In the last decade, measurements of the QSO luminosity function and clustering have provided particularly powerful constraints on a globally-averaged [formula] (e.g. [\citealt=kel10]), but they also rely on the poorly-constrained black hole mass function or assume that the most luminous QSOs populate the most massive halos, contrary to some observations and physically-motivated models (e.g. [\citealt=tra12] [\citealt=ade05e] [\citealt=con13]). These global measures of [formula] are also degenerate between single-phase QSO accretion (in which the bulk of activity occurs in a single event) and multi-burst models (in which the same total time in a QSO phase is distributed over many short accretion events).

More direct measurements of [formula] may be obtained from the effect of QSO radiation on their local enviroments. Measures of the transverse proximity effect use the volumes (and associated light-travel times) over which bright QSOs ionize their nearby gas and have yielded estimates or lower limits in the range [formula] Myr by tracing (e.g. [\citealt=jak03] [\citealt=wor07]) and metal-line [\citep=gon08] absorption systems.

The detection of fluorescent Lyα emission provides another direct measurement of [formula]. Fluorescent Lyα arises from the reprocessing of ionizing photons (either from the metagalactic UV background or a local QSO) at the surfaces of dense, neutral clouds of . This effect has been modeled with increasing complexity over the last few decades [\citep=hog87] [\citep=gou96] [\citep=can05] [\citep=kol10] and has now been observed around bright QSOs ([\citealt=ade06] [\citealt=can07] [\citealt=can12]; Trainor et al. 2013, in prep.). These detections have verified the feasibility of identifying fluorescent emission from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and suggested a wide opening angle [formula] of QSO emission (but see also [\citealt=hen13]). They are consistent with other constraints on [formula], but have been limited by small sample sizes and/or a lack of the 3D spatial information necessary to probe the spatial variation of the QSO radiation field in detail.

This paper presents results from a large survey of Lyα emitters (LAEs) in fields surrounding hyperluminous ([formula] L) QSOs at redshifts 2.5  <  z  <  2.9. The full results of this survey, including a detailed analysis of the Lyα emission mechanisms and physical properties of the LAEs, will be presented in Trainor et al. (2013, in prep.; hereafter Paper II). This paper focuses on the implications of these data for [formula] and [formula]. Observations and the data are briefly discussed in §[\ref=sec:obs]; identification of fluorescent sources is discussed in §[\ref=subsec:fluor]; constraints on [formula] and [formula] appear in §[\ref=subsec:tdelay]-  §[\ref=subsec:theta]; and conclusions are given in §[\ref=sec:conclusions]. A standard cosmology with H0 = 70 km s- 1 and [formula] is assumed throughout, and distances are given in physical units (e.g. pMpc).

Observations

We conducted deep imaging in each survey field using custom narrow-band filters and corresponding broad-band filters sampling the continuum near Lyα with Keck 1/LRIS-B over several years; these data are described in Paper II. All 8 fields are part of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS; [\citealt=rud12a]; Steidel et al. 2013, in prep.)

We used 1 of 4 narrow-band filters to image each of the 8 QSO fields (centered on or near the QSO); a brief description of the fields and corresponding filters is given in Table [\ref=table:fields]. Each filter has a FWHM [formula]Å and a central wavelength tuned to Lyα at the redshift of one or more of the hyperluminous QSOs. The QSOs span a redshift range 2.573  ≤  z  ≤  2.843, and the filter width corresponds to Δz  ≈  0.066 or Δv  ≈  5400 km s- 1 at their median redshift. The narrow-band images have total integration times of 5-7 hours and reach a depth for point sources of [formula]; the continuum images are typically deeper by ~  1.5 mag.

Object identification and narrow-band and continuum magnitude measurements were performed with SExtractor. The success rate of our initial follow-up spectroscopy dropped sharply above [formula], so our LAEs are selected to have [formula] and [formula] (corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent width in Lyα [formula]Å). These criteria define a set of 841 LAEs. The LAEs range from unresolved/compact to extremely extended (FWHM [formula]) sources. The extended objects require large photometric apertures that may enclose unassociated continuum sources; in order to avoid the complication of determining the true continuum counterparts of these sources, LAEs with FWHM > 3 arcsec  were removed from our sample for this analysis, leaving a final photometric sample of 816 LAEs.

Spectra were obtained with Keck 1/LRIS-B in the multislit mode using the 600/4000 grism; the spectral resolution near Lyα for these spectra is R  ~  1100. Redshifts were measured via an automated algorithm described in Paper II; the detected Lyα lines have a minimum SNR ~   3.5 and a median SNR ~   15. Detected lines were required to lie at a wavelength where the transmission exceeds 10% for the narrow-band filter used to select their associated candidates (typically a ~  110Å range), but no other prior was used to constrain the automatic line detection. Redshifts were measured for 260 of the LAEs meeting our final photometric criteria; these comprise the spectroscopic sample used in this paper. QSO redshifts were determined as described in [\citet=tra12] and have estimated uncertainties [formula] km s- 1.

Results

Detection of Fluorescent Emission

Lyα emission is subject to complex radiative-transfer effects and is ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies, so accurate discrimination between fluorescence and other Lyα emission mechanisms is key to its use as a QSO probe (see [\citealt=can05] [\citealt=kol10]). A powerful tool in this regard is the rest-frame equivalent width of Lyα (W0), which has a natural maximum in star-forming sources because the same massive stars produce the UV continuum and the ionizing photons that are reprocessed as Lyα emission. Empirically, UV-continuum-selected galaxies at [formula] almost never exhibit W0 > 100Å [\citep=kor10], which is also the maximum value expected for continuous star-formation lasting [formula] yr or longer [\citep=ste11]. This threshold may demarcate the realm of fluorescence from that of typical star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, models of star-formation in the extreme limits of metallicity and short bursts predict a stringent limit of W0 < 240 Å (see [\citealt=sch02] and discussion in [\citealt=can12]) for even the most atypical star-forming galaxies.

The distribution of W0 and [formula] for the LAEs are displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:nbma]. Observed-frame equivalent widths (W) were measured from the narrow-band color excess while accounting for the presence of Lyα within the continuum filter bandpass; details of this procedure are given in Paper II. W0 is estimated from W by [formula], where [formula] is the redshift of the associated hyperluminous QSO.

Fig. [\ref=fig:nbma] demonstrates that many of our LAEs exceed both the model and empirical thresholds for the maximum W0 consistent with pure star formation: of the 816 LAEs, 116 exceed W0 > 100Å and 32 exceed W0 > 240Å. We consider these high-W0 sources as excellent candidates to be fluorescence-dominated, with minimal stellar contribution to their Lyα flux.

Time delay of fluorescent emission

The presence of a fluorescent emitter indicates that its local volume element was illuminated by ionizing QSO radiation at the lookback time [formula] when the observed Lyα photon was emitted. Depending on whether the fluorescent source lies in the foreground or background of the QSO, [formula] may be greater or less than [formula], the lookback time to the QSO itself.

However, this fluorescent Lyα photon was generated by the reprocessing of an ionizing QSO photon emitted a time [formula] before [formula], where [formula] is the light-travel time from the QSO to the emitter. It is geometrically trivial to show that [formula], and we can define the delay time for an emitter at a vector position [formula]:

[formula]

It can likewise be shown that the locus of points for which [formula] is constant forms a paraboloid pointed toward the observer with the QSO at the focal point (see Fig. [\ref=fig:zcombo], top, for a pictorial representation at varying values of [formula]).

The significance of such a delay surface can be seen by considering a simple, step-function model of QSO emission in which the ionizing emission was zero a time [formula] before we observe the QSO and has been constant since that time. Under such a model, the ionizing field is zero for [formula], and the spatial distribution of fluorescent emitters must be restricted to the interior of the paraboloid defined by [formula].

Since the high-W0 LAEs described in §[\ref=subsec:fluor] are highly likely to be dominated by fluorescence, they represent the best tracers of the QSO ionizing field. Below, we use the distribution of these sources to set limits on [formula].

Constraints on [formula] from the redshift distribution

The geometry of our survey volume is such that we can probe long timescales (107 yr [formula] yr) via the line-of-sight distribution of sources (see red box in Fig. [\ref=fig:zcombo], top). The distribution of W0 vs. [formula] for the 260 LAEs with measured redshifts is displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:zcombo] (middle), where [formula] is the Hubble distance of each emitter from its associated hyperluminous QSO determined from the difference of emitter and QSO redshifts.

Due to the effects of redshifts errors and peculiar velocities among the LAEs and QSOs, our foreground/background discrimination breaks down at Δv  ≈  700 km s- 1, corresponding to [formula] pMpc and [formula] Myr; we are therefore unable to constrain [formula] lower than 20 Myr based on the redshift distribution of sources. At [formula] Myr, however, there is a significant paucity of high-W0 sources: only four sources with W0 > 100Å lie in this range, and there are none at [formula] Myr. This suggests [formula] Myr for these fields; we evaluate the significance of this result via numerical tests below.

The non-uniform redshift coverage of our QSO fields complicates the analysis of [formula]; the observed redshift distribution is modulated by the narrow-band filter bandpass and the distribution of large-scale structure along the QSO line of sight. In addition, the QSO redshifts are not perfectly centered in their filter bandpasses, which contributes part of the observed asymmetry. Fortunately, the distribution of star-forming galaxies presumably represented by our W0 < 100Å LAEs trace all of these effects, and we can use their redshift distribution to determine the expected distribution of emitters in the absence of fluorescence. We use the entire sample of emitters with spectroscopic redshifts and W0 < 100Å for this comparison.

Firstly, we utilize the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, a measure of the probability that two samples of observations are drawn from the same parent distribution. Evaluating the test on the distributions of [formula]Å) and [formula]Å) yields a KS statistic [formula], corresponding to p < 4  ×  10- 3. There are insufficient emitters with redshift measurements to perform the test on the higher-threshold (W0 > 240Å) sample with significance.

A disadvantage of the two-sample KS test is that it is most sensitive to differences that occur near the center of two distributions, whereas we expect the strongest deviation in these distributions at large [formula], where no fluorescent emitters would appear if [formula] Myr. For this reason, we conducted a Monte-Carlo test in which subsamples of the W0 < 100Å LAEs were randomly selected (with replacement), where each subsample has 67 objects, the number of W0 > 100Å emitters with spectroscopic redshifts in our actual sample. For each subsample, the number of sources with [formula] pMpc (corresponding to [formula] Myr) was counted.

As noted above, only four sources with W0 > 100Å exceed [formula] pMpc. In 105 simulated subsamples, 40 had three or fewer objects with [formula] pMpc, yielding a significance p < 4  ×  10- 4. We therefore conclude that the 7 QSOs with spectroscopic follow-up (ie. all except Q2343+12) are consistent with [formula] Myr (approximately the lowest it can be measured unambiguously from our redshift measurements).

Constraints on [formula] from the projected distribution

While the redshift distribution is not sensitive for probing shorter QSO lifetimes, sufficiently small values of [formula] will affect the projected distribution of sources in the survey volume. In particular, the constant-[formula] paraboloids for [formula] Myr are well matched to the geometry of our survey volume (see curves on the left side of Fig. [\ref=fig:zcombo], top).

Fig. [\ref=fig:rcombo] shows the correspondence of these surfaces (shown for 104 yr [formula] yr) to the radial distribution of W0 for the entire photometric sample (note that the survey geometry is not to scale, unlike in Fig. [\ref=fig:zcombo]). As above, a QSO with [formula] will produce fluorescent emission only within the corresponding paraboloid. For [formula] Myr, this would produce a maximum projected distance ([formula]) at which a fluorescent emitter could appear in our survey volume. For 0.3 Myr [formula] Myr, the fractional volume of the survey within the time-delay surface decreases with increasing [formula], predicting that the probability of a given emitter exhibiting fluorescence will likewise decrease with [formula].

Notably, the projected distribution of LAEs is well-populated by objects with W0 > 100Å and those with W0 > 240Å out to the largest values of [formula] probed by our survey, thus firmly ruling out lifetimes [formula] Myr. Furthermore, the radial distributions of sources with W0 > 100Å and W0  ≤  100Å are entirely consistent when subjected to a two sample KS test ([formula]; p < 0.24); the null result is similar using the W0 = 240Å threshold. Given the large number of objects in our photometric sample ([formula]), these data provide strong evidence that [formula] Myr for the QSOs in our sample.

Constraints on [formula]

For [formula], a substantial fraction of the survey volume at large [formula] will be inaccessible to the ionizing emission of the QSO, which will affect the distribution of [formula] for fluorescent sources similarly to [formula] Myr. We can probe [formula] in detail through the 2D spatial distribution of those high-W0 LAEs with spectroscopic redshifts. It is easily seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:rcombo] (top) that the high-W0 LAEs (red and orange points) extend to large projected radii at or near the QSO redshift, suggesting that ionizing emission is emanating from the QSO nearly perpindicularly to the line of sight (ie. with [formula]). In reality, redshift errors and peculiar velocities prohibit us from establishing the line-of-sight distance of an LAE from the QSO to be less than 3 pMpc (see §[\ref=subsec:zdist]), so these data (with a 2 pMpc projected range) provide the constraint [formula].

Conclusions

We have presented constraints on the lifetime and opening angle of ionizing QSO emission based on a large photometric/spectroscopic survey of LAEs in the regions around hyperluminous QSOs (described in detail in Paper II), finding 1 Myr [formula] 20 Myr and [formula].

These results are consistent with the most of the literature discussed in §[\ref=sec:intro]; in particular, our estimate of [formula] falls at the short end of the broad range allowed by the measurements reviewed in [\citet=mar04] and is similar to the transverse proximity effect measurements of [\citet=gon08], which included a QSO of comparable luminosity to those in this sample. Perhaps most significantly, [formula] measured here is short compared to the e-folding timescale of [\citet=sal64]: [formula] Myr for a QSO with [formula] and a radiative efficiency [formula]. Unless these QSOs have [formula] or are accreting with a low radiative efficiency (neither of which is expected for luminous QSOs), then these observed hyperluminous accretion events do not dominate the accretion history of their central black holes.
