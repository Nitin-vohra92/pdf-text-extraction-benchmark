Introduction and definitions

Let X and Y be two finite abstract simplicial complexes. An isomorphism from X to Y is a bijection φ:V(X)  →  V(Y) such that for σ  ⊆  V(X), σ is a simplex of X if and only if φ(σ) is a simplex of Y. Two simplicial complexes X, Y are called (simplicially) isomorphic when such an isomorphism exists. An isomorphism from a simplicial complex X to itself is called an automorphism of X. All the automorphisms of X form a group, which is denoted by Aut(X). A simplicial complex M is said to be a triangulated d-manifold if it's geometric carrier |M| is a topological d-manifold. When d = 2, a connected combinatorial 2-manifold X is said to be vertex-transitive if the automorphism group of X acts transitively on V(X).

Let G1(V1,E1) and G2(V2,E2) be two simple graphs on the torus. Then [formula] is a graph G(V,E) where [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, [formula] is a graph G(V,E) where [formula] and [formula]. A map M is an embedding of a graph G on a surface S such that the closure of components of [formula], called the faces of M, are closed 2-cells i.e. each homeomorphic to 2-disk. A map M is said to be a polyhedral map if the intersection of any two distinct faces is either empty, a common vertex, or a common edge. The following definitions are given more clearly in [\cite=upadhyay1]. A a-cycle Ca is a finite connected 2-regular graph with p vertices and the face sequence of a vertex v in a map is a finite sequence [formula] of powers of positive integers [formula] and [formula] such that through the vertex v, p number of Ca (Ca denote the a - cycle), q number of Cb, , r number of Cm are incident. A map K is said to be semi-equivelar if face sequence of each vertex is same. Let K be a map of type [formula] on n vertices on the torus. By Euler's formula, [formula], that is, [formula], that is, [formula], where d denote the degree of a vertex and dt denote the number of adjacent faces of length t at a vertex for [formula]. Now for fixed d, we check all possible values of dt for [formula] such that [formula]. This gives eight semi-equivelar maps of types {33,42}, {32,4,3,4}, {6,3,6,3}, {34,6}, {4,82}, {3,122}, {4,6,12}, {6,4,3,4}. These maps are vertex-transitive by the result of [\cite=such]. This imply, the edge graph of each semi-equivelar map on the torus is vertex-transitive. The connectivity number k(G) of a graph G is defined as the minimum number of vertices whose removal from G results in a disconnected graph or in the trivial graph. A graph G is said to be k-connected if k(G) ≥   k. Now, we introduce the result given in [\cite=godsil_royle], a vertex-transitive graph with degree k has connectivity at least [formula]. This gives the maps of types {4,82}, {3,122}, {4,6,12} are 3-connected, {6,3,6,3}, {6,4,3,4} are 4-connected and {33,42}, {32,4,3,4}, {34,6} are at least 4-connected. Therefore the maps of types {33,42}, {32,4,3,4}, {6,3,6,3}, {6,4,3,4}, {34,6} are 4-connected. Gr[formula]nbaum [\cite=grunbaum] and Nash-Williams [\cite=nash_williams] conjectured the following:

Every 4-connected graph on the torus has a Hamiltonian cycle.

We summarize the known existence results about existence of Hamiltonian cycles in graphs on torus and Klein bottle these are the some partial results of the conjecture [\ref=conj1]. Altshuler [\cite=a1] has shown that every 6 and 4-connected equivelar maps of type {3,6} and {4,4} respectively on torus have Hamiltonian cycles. Burnet and Richter[\cite=brunet_richter] have shown that every 5-connected triangulations on torus is Hamiltonian and Thomas and Yu[\cite=thomas_yu] have improved this result for any 5-connected graphs. Brunet, Nakamoto and Negami [\cite=brunet_nakamoto_negami] have shown every 5-connected triangulated Klein bottle is Hamiltonian. Kawarabayashi and Ozeki[\cite=kawarabayashi_ozeki] showed every 4-connected triangulated torus is Hamiltonian. In this article, we give partial solution of the conjecture as follows,

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm1]: Proof of the theorem[\ref=thm1] follows from theorem [\ref=thm1.3], [\ref=thm2.1], [\ref=thm3.2], [\ref=thm4.1], [\ref=df8.1]. [formula]

Main result of this article is the following theorem.

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm2]: Proof of the theorem [\ref=thm2] follows from theorem [\ref=thm1], [\ref=df5.1], [\ref=thm7.1]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm3]: Proof of the theorem [\ref=thm3] follows from theorem [\ref=thm6.1]. [formula]

Let C, D be two cycles. We define a cylinder SC,D be a set of complex with two boundary components C, D. This notion has been introduced in [\cite=upadhyay1]. Let C, D be two cycles of same type in a map on the torus. The type of the cycles has been defined clearly in each section. The cycle C is said to be homologous to D if there exist a cylinder which is bounded by C and D. We denote a cycle [formula] by [formula] in this article. Let [formula] and [formula] be two cycles. Let uiui + 1  =  vkvk + 1. We define a cycle C(u1, [formula] ui, vk - 1, vk - 2, [formula] v1, vt, vt - 1, [formula] vk + 1, ui + 2, [formula] ur). If C1 and C2 both bounds 2-disk then C bounds a 2-disk. The cycle C is called concatenation of C1 and C2. Let Q1(u1  →  uk) be a path. We call a path Q2(v1  →  vr) is extended from Q1 if V(Q1)  ⊂  V(Q2), E(Q1)  ⊂  E(Q2) and [formula]. We call Q2 is extended path. A notion of a normal path and normal cycle are defined in [\cite=a1] to show the existence of Hamiltonian cycle in 4 and 6-regular maps on the torus. We have used the analogous definitions of normal path and normal cycle in this article. We define paths and cycles to discuss the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in each map of types {33,42}, {32,4,3,4}, {6,3,6,3}, {34,6}, {4,82}, {3,122}, {4,6,12}, {6,4,3,4} on the torus. The basic idea introduced as follows :

Let M be a semi-equivelar map on the torus. We cut the torus along meridian and longitude, we get a planar representation. We define cycles in M at a vertex locally such that each divides the degree of the vertex into a fixed ratio and maintains this ratio along the sequence of vertices throughout the cycle. We cut M along any two non homologous cycles at a vertex to get a planer representation of M. We denote this representation by (r,s,k)-representation. In this article we use T(r,s,k) to represent (r,s,k)-representation of a map. This representation has been defined more clearly in each section. This representation is called a planar representation of the map M on the torus. This (r,s,k)-representation always exist for a semi-equivelar map. This idea also has been used in [\cite=maity_upadhyay1]. A cycle which contains all the vertices of the map and bounds a 2-disk is called contractible Hamiltonian cycle. If it does not bounds any 2-disk then we call non-contractible. We show the existence of contractible and non-contractible Hamiltonian cycles using T(r,s,k) of M. The concept of contractible Hamiltonian cycles also has been studied in [\cite=maity_upadhyay0] [\cite=upadhyay0]. We use this contractible Hamiltonian cycle to show the existence of Hamiltonian cycle in M.

Map of type {33,42}

Let M be a map of type {33,42} on the torus. We define paths as follows :

Let [formula] be a path in M. The path P is said to be well defined at an inner vertex ui if adjacent all the triangles on one side and all quadrangles on the other side of ui - 1  →  ui  →  ui + 1 at ui. If ut is a boundary vertex of P then there is a well defined extended path of P where ut is an inner vertex. We denote this path by A1.

We define link of a vertex w and denote it by lk(w). If lk(w) contains any bold vertex then it indicates the non adjacent vertex to w. In this section, we consider a vertex w with link lk(w) = C(2,v3,4,v5,v6,v7,v1). In this link 2 and 4 are non adjacent vertices. We consider the permutation of vertices in the link lk(w) counter clockwise locally at w. We use the notation throughout this article.

Let [formula] be a path in M. Let ui,ui + 1 be two inner vertices of P or an extended path of P. Then P is said to be well defined at vertex ui if

the link lk(ui) = C(, ui - 1, , c, ui + 1, d, e) gives the link lk(ui + 1) = C(', ui + 2, ', d, ui, c, p) and

the link lk(ui) = C(,ui + 1,,l,ui - 1,k,m) gives the link lk(ui + 1) = C(',ui, ', k, ui + 2, l, p).

We called ui + 1, ui - 1 are successor and predecessor of ui respectively in P. We denote this path by A2.

Let [formula] be a path in M. Let ui,ui + 1 be two inner vertices of P or an extended path of P. Then P is said to be well defined at vertex ui if

the link lk(ui) = C(, ui - 1, , c, d, ui + 1, e) gives the link lk(ui + 1) = C(', ui + 2, ', p, e, ui, d) and

the link lk(ui) = C(', ui + 1, ', p, e, ui - 1, d) gives the link lk(ui + 1) = C(, ui, , c, d, ui + 2, e).

We denote this path by A3.

In each section, we have defined paths in map of fixed type. We have used the different notation for different path at each definition. In this section, we have consider the paths of type At for t∈{1,2,3}. Now we consider maximal path of type At for t∈{1,2,3}. We show that they are cycles. More precisely, let Q(v1  →  vr) be a maximal path. Then, by the property of maximality, there is an edge vrv1 in the map. This gives the cycle [formula]. Therefore we claim that,  Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm1.1] Let P(u1  →  u2  →  ...  →  ur) be a maximal path of type A1. We consider the vertex ur and link lk(ur) = C(,y,,w,v,u,ur - 1). If w  =  u1 then [formula] is a cycle. If w  ≠  u1 then by the definition [\ref=def1.1] ur is an inner vertex in the extended path of P. This gives a path, say Q, which is extended from P and length(P)  <  length(Q). Which is a contradiction as P is maximal path. Therefore w  =  u1 and the path P gives the cycle [formula]. We use similar argument to show every maximal path of types A2 and A3 is cycle. [formula]

In each section, we use the terminology cycle in place of maximal path which is cycle. In this section it is cycle by theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. Now, we show that if any two cycles of type At intersect then they are identical for t∈{1,2,3}. Therefore we claim that,

Let C1,C2 be two cycles of type At for t∈{1,2,3}. Then, C1  =  C2 if [formula].

Proof of Lemma[\ref=lem1.1] Let [formula] and [formula] be two cycles of type A1. If [formula] then there is a vertex [formula]. The cycles C1 and C2 both are well defined at w. We consider the link lk(w)  =  C(1,w2,3,w4,w5,w6,w7). By definition [\ref=def1.1], w4,w7∈Ct for t∈{1,2}. This gives w4  →  w  →  w7 is part of Ct for t∈{1,2}. If w  =  u1t1  =  u2t2 then w4  =  u1t1 - 1  =  u2t2 - 1 and w7  =  u1t1 + 1  =  u2t2 + 1 for some [formula] and [formula]. Now, we have u1t1 - 1  =  u2t2 - 1. We continue with this argument. We stop after finite steps as r,s both finite. If r  <  s then we get [formula] and u11  =  u2I + r + 1 for some [formula]. This imply that I + 1  =  I + r + 1 and the cycle C2 which contains a cycle of length r. This gives r  =  s. Hence C1  =  C2. We use similar argument for the cycles of type At for t∈{2,3}. [formula]

We choose a cycle C of type At for t∈{1,2,3} in M. We define a cylinder SC as follows. Let u be a vertex in C. We collect all adjacent faces of u in a set, say S. We do it for each vertex of C. We consider geometric carrier of S which is a cylinder and denote it by SC. It has two boundary cycles either disjoint or identical by lemma [\ref=lem1.1]. Let ∂SC  =  {C1,C2}. We claim that length(C)  =  length(C1)  =  length(C2), that is,

Let SC be a cylinder where C is a cycle of type At for t∈{1,2,3}. Also, let ∂SC  =  {C1,C2}. Then length(C)  =  length(C1)  =  length(C2).

Proof of Lemma[\ref=lem1.2] Let SC be a cylinder of type A1. Let [formula] be a sequence of adjacent faces in one side of C. The same sequence [formula] of faces is also adjacent to Ct on one side of Ct for t  =  1 or 2. Therefore the sequence of types of faces in the other side of C will follow on the other side of Ct for t  =  1 or 2. This gives the cycle Ct is of type A1 for t∈{1,2}. It can be seen clearly from Figure 1 by considering the cycle [formula]. Here [formula]. Similar argument we use for the cycle of type Aj for j∈{2,3}.

Let length(C)  ≠  length(C1)  ≠  length(C2). Also, let [formula], C1(v1, v2, [formula] and [formula] be three cycles of type A1. This gives [formula]. Without loss of generality we assume r  <  s and [formula]. Now there is a shortest path, say v1  →  u1  →  w1 of type A2 or A3 between v1 and w1 via u1. This gives a path vi  →  ui  →  wi of type A2 or A3 between vi and wi via ui. Hence by the assumption r  <  s, there does not exist any path of length two between vr + j and wr via ur for some j( > 0). This gives the link of ur is different from link of ur - 1. Which is a contradiction as the map M of type {33,42}. Hence r  =  s  =  t, that is, length(C)  =  length(C1)  =  length(C2). Similar argument we use for the cycle of type Aj for j∈{2,3}. [formula]

The cycles C and Ct for t∈{1,2} are homologous. Let [formula] be the possible list of homologous cycles of C. We claim that all of them have same length, that is,

Let [formula] be the possible list of homologous cycles of type At for t∈{1,2,3}. Then length(Ci) = length(Cj) [formula] [formula].

Proof of Lemma[\ref=lem1.3] We consider a cylinder SCi of Ci of type A1. Then we get a sub sequence [formula] of [formula] such that if we take any consecutive three cycles then they form a cylinder. Therefore, by the lemma [\ref=lem1.2], [formula]. This is true for any sub sequence of [formula]. Therefore, length(Ci)  =  length(Cj) [formula] i,j∈{1,2,...,m}. Similar argument we use for the cycle of type Aj for j∈{2,3}. [formula]

We define a (r,s,k)-representation of a map M of type {33,42} on the torus. We consider a vertex v. By definition [\ref=def1.1], [\ref=def1.2] and [\ref=def1.3], we have three cycles at v, say L1(v),L2(v),L3(v), of types A1, A2 and A3 at v respectively. We cut M along the cycle L1, see Figure 1, [formula]. Then starting at v make another cut along L3 until reaching L1 again for the first time where the starting adjacent face to the horizontal base cycle L1 is 4-gon. In Figure 1, v  =  v1. Let it crosses, say s, number of cycles homologous to L1. In this section, the number s of cycles which are homologous to L1 is equal to the length of the path. In Figure 1, we took second cut along the path v1  →  w1  →  x1  →  z1  →  vk + 1 which is part of L3 and s  =  4. Let length(L1)  =  r. We start from v and denote the sequence of vertices along L1 by [formula]. Hence we get a representation of M and denoted it by (r,s)-representation. In the representation, we get identification of vertical sides in the natural manner but the identification of the horizontal sides needs some shifting in (r,s)-representation so that a vertex in the lower(base) side is identified with a vertex in the upper side. Let vk + 1 be the starting vertex of the upper horizontal cycle. Then k denote the length of vk + 1 from v1 in lower horizontal cycle L1. Therefore we represent the (r,s)-representation by (r,s,k)-representation. In Figure 1, the vertex vk + 1 is the starting vertex of the upper horizontal cycle [formula] and [formula]. By this construction we can show that every map of type {33,42} has a (r,s,k)-representation, that is, T(r,s,k) . Therefore we claim it as a theorem,

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm1.2] Proof of the theorem [\ref=thm1.2] follows from the following argument. [formula]

Now we show the main result of this section that every map of type {33,42} on the torus has a contractible Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore we claim that,

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm1.3] By theorem [\ref=thm1.2], the map M on the torus has a representation T(r,s,k). The T(r,s,k) has a rectangular planar shape with identical horizontal cycles and vertical paths on the boundary. Let C1,C2,...,Cs be the list of horizontal cycles of type A1 (by the theorem [\ref=thm1.1]) of length, say r (by the lemma [\ref=lem1.3]). Now, at each vertex we have only one cycle of type A1. Therefore the cycles C1,C2,...,Cs will cover all the vertices of M, that is, [formula]. We define cycles as follows, [formula], [formula], [formula], , [formula] in order, that is, if we consider any consecutive three cycles Ck, Ck + 1, Ck + 2 then ∂SCk + 1  =  {Ck,Ck + 2}. In Figure 1, we have four cycles [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We consider a cylinder which is bounded by Ci - 1 and Ci where i is even integer and contains all quadrangles. For an even integer i, we define a new cycle Ci - 1,i: = C(ui - 11, ui - 12, [formula] uir, [formula] ui1). It is contractible as it bounds a 2-disk which contains only quadrangles. In Figure 1, for i = 2 the cycle is C(v1, v2, [formula] vr, wr, wr - 1, [formula] w1) which is defined by C1 and C2. Therefore, for each pair of cycles {Ci - 1,Ci} where [formula], we have a contractible cycle Ci - 1,i. We consider two cycles Ci - 1,i, Ci + 1,i + 2 and adjacent two 3-gons [formula] and [formula]. For an even integer i, we define a cycle [formula] ui - 11,, ui - 12, ui - 1r, uir, uir - 1, ui2, ui + 12,, ui + 13, , ui + 1r, ui + 2r, ui + 2r - 1, , ui + 21, ui + 11, ui1) which is concatenation of Ci - 1,i and Ci + 1,i + 2. Therefore we define cycle [formula]. The cycle C is contractible as each Ci - 1,i is contractible. Also the cycle C is Hamiltonian as it contains all the vertices of Ci for [formula]. Therefore the map M is Hamiltonian and contains contractible Hamiltonian cycle. [formula]

Map of type {32,4,3,4}

We consider a map M of type {32,4,3,4}. We define a path in M as follows :

Let [formula] be a path in M. The path P is said to be well defined at a vertex ui if we denote ui + 1, ui - 1 be the successor and predecessor of ui respectively in P or in the extended path of P then,

the link of ui, lk(ui) = C(, ui + 1,b, c,,ui - 1,e) gives lk(ui - 1) = C(,g, e,ui,, d,ui - 2) and lk(ui + 1) = C(, a,k,ui + 2,, b,ui) and

the link of ui, lk(ui) = C(, h,k,ui + 1,, b,ui - 1) gives lk(ui - 1) = C(,ui, b,c,, ui - 2,e) and lk(ui + 1) = C(, ui + 2,t,l,b,ui,k).

We denote this path by B1.

We consider a maximal path P of type B1. The path P is cycle by the similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. We consider two cycles C1 and C2 of type B1. We claim the next lemma ,

Let C1 and C2 be two cycles of type B1. Then C1  =  C2 if [formula].

Proof of Lemma[\ref=lem2.1] Let [formula] and [formula] be two cycles. Let [formula] then there is a [formula] where e  =  yx. The cycles C1,C2 both are well defined at y, x. We consider the link of x. If lk(x)  =  C(,b,c,w,,e,y) then w∈V(Ci) for i∈{1,2} by the definition [\ref=df2.1]. This gives, the path y  →  x  →  w is part of both C1 and C2, that is, y  =  u1t1 - 1  =  u2t2 - 1, x  =  u1t1  =  u2t2 and w  =  u1t1 + 1  =  u2t2 + 1 for some [formula] and [formula]. Again, we consider the edge xw and continue. We stop after r steps. Let t2 - t1  =  m for some m. Hence we get [formula] and u11  =  u2m + r + 1. This imply that m + 1  =  m + r + 1 and r  =  s as u1m + r + 1  =  u2m + 1 and C2 is cycle. This gives the cycles are identical. If lk(x)  =  C(,b,c,w,,y,e) then b∈V(Ci) for i∈{1,2}. By the similar argument, the cycles C1 and C2 are identical. Therefore, [formula] gives C1  =  C2. [formula]

We choose a vertex u in C of type B1. We collect all adjacent faces of u in a set, say S. We do it for all of V(C). We consider geometric carrier of S which is a cylinder as the boundaries of the cylinder are either two disjoint cycles or an identical cycle. We denote it by SC. Let ∂SC  =  {C1,C2}. Now we claim the next lemma,

Let C be a cycle of type B1 and ∂SC  =  {C1,C2}. Then C1  =  C2 if [formula].

Proof of Lemma[\ref=lem3.2] Suppose [formula] is non empty then [formula] is a set of vertices or contains an edge. Now we have the following cases,

Let [formula] be a set of vertices and does not contain edge. Let [formula]. We consider adjacent edges of u where u∈V(Ci) for i∈{1,2}. Now by definition [\ref=df2.1], the number of adjacent edges on one side of the cycle Ci is two and on the other side one at each vertex. Therefore, the [formula] or 4 in the cylinder for u∈V(Ci). If we assume [formula] for u∈V(C1) then, for u∈V(C2) [formula] in cylinder. This gives [formula]. Hence the degree of u is at least seven which is a contradiction as the degree of u is five. Therefore [formula] contains an edge. Now, by the lemma [\ref=lem2.1], C1  =  C2.

If [formula] contains an edge then by lemma [\ref=lem2.1], C1  =  C2. [formula]

Therefore the boundaries of a cylinder SC are either two disjoint cycles or an identical cycle. Hence SC is a cylinder with two boundaries C1 and C2 of type B1. We consider a cylinder SCi which is bounded by two cycles, say Cl,Ck. Then they are of same length by the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.2]. If we consider any two homologous cycles C1,C2 of type B1 then length(C1)  =  length(C2) by the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.3]. By the definition [\ref=df2.1] we have two cycles of type B1 at a vertex v, say L1(v),L2(v). We define T(r,s,k) of M by the construction of (r,s,k)-representation done in Section 2. Here, we take the second cut along the cycle L2(v) where the starting adjacent face to the base horizontal cycle is 4-gon. Hence we get T(r,s,k) of the map M of type {32,4,3,4}. This T(r,s,k) exists for any map of type {32,4,3,4} on the torus. See Figure 2, it is T(r,4,2k). Here [formula] and the path v1  →  w1  →  x1  →  z1  →  v2k + 1 which is part of the cycle L2. Along this path we took the second cut. We consider [formula] be the sequence of all possible homologous horizontal cycles of length, say r ( by the lemma [\ref=lem2.1]) of type B1 in T(r,s,k). We use similar argument like done in theorem [\ref=thm1.3]. Hence we get a cycle C which is contractible and Hamiltonian. Therefore the map of type {32,4,3,4} on the torus is Hamiltonian.

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm2.1] The proof of the theorem [\ref=thm2.1] follows from the result of this section. [formula]

Map of type {6,3,6,3}

We consider a map M of type {6,3,6,3}. We define a path as follows :

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path in M. We denote Av be a set of edges which are adjacent at a vertex v in M. The path P is said to be well defined at an inner vertex ui if,

two edges of M emerge from ui which are not in [formula],

one of them on one side of ui - 1  →  ui  →  ui + 1and remaining one on the other side.

The boundary vertex of P also well defined in the extended path of P, that is, there is a path which contains the path P and satisfy (1) and (2) and both the boundary vertices of P are inner vertices.

We denote this path by X1.

We consider a maximal path of type X1 which is cycle by the similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. By definition [\ref=df3.1], we can define two cycles of type X1 at each vertex. We consider two cycles of type X1 at a vertex v, say L1(v),L2(v). We define (r,s,k)-representation of a map M by the similar argument given in Section 2. Hence we get T(r,s,k) of M. Figure 3 is a T(8,2,6) of a map of type {6,3,6,3} on 24 vertices. In Figure 3, L1  =  C(v1, v2, v3, [formula] v8) and the path v1  →  v9  →  v13  →  v21  →  v7 which is part of L2. In the process we take second cut along the cycle L2 where the starting adjacent face to the base horizontal cycle L1 is 3-gon. Now we claim the following theorem,

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm3.2] We denote C1 be horizontal base cycle of T(r,s,k). We consider all horizontal cycles which are homologous to C1, say [formula] of length, say r (by the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.2]). Let C1(u1,1, u1,2, [formula] u1,r), C2(u2,1, u2,2, [formula] u2,r),[formula], Ct(ut,1, ut,2, [formula] ut,r) be the cycles. In Figure 3, C1  =  C(v1, [formula] v8) and C2  =  C(v13, [formula] v20). We denote a vertex u(ik - 1,ik),(i + 1k - 2,i + 1k - 1) which does not belongs to any one of the cycles [formula]. Let u(ik - 1,ik),(i + 1k - 2,i + 1k - 1) adjacent to the vertices uik - 1, uik of Ci and ui + 1k - 2, ui + 1k - 1 of Ci + 1. Also there are two 3-gons [formula] →   uik →   u(ik - 1,ik),(i + 1k - 2,i + 1k - 1) →   uik - 1) and [formula] →   ui + 1k - 1 →   u(ik - 1,ik),(i + 1k - 2,i + 1k - 1) →   ui + 1k - 2) which are adjacent to the vertex u(ik - 1,ik),(i + 1k - 2,i + 1k - 1). In Figure 3, t  =  2 and v(15,16),(216,217)  =  v11. When t  =  1, we use u(ik - 1,ik) in place of u(ik - 1,ik),(i + 1k - 2,i + 1k - 1) as upper and base horizontal cycles are same in T(r,s,k). Now we follow one of the following cases:

Let t  =  1. We consider [formula]. Also we consider adjacent 3-gons to C1. We concatenate the cycle C1 and 3-gons which are adjacent to the cycle C1 and contains a new vertex. Hence we get a cycle C(u1,1,u(11,12), u1,2, u1,3, u(13,14), u1,4, [formula] u1,r - 1, u(1r - 1,1r),u1,r). This cycle contains all the vertices of M.

Let t  =  2. We denote a set [formula]. We consider all adjacent 6-gons to the cycle C1 in S except last one. In Figure 3, last 6-gon is F6(v1,v9,v20,v19,v12,v8). Also we consider all adjacent 3-gons to C1 in S. The geometric carrier |S| is a 2-disk. If there is a vertex which is not on the boundary of 2-disk |S| then there is a 3-gon adjacent along an edge to 2-disk and contains the vertex. We put this 3-gon in S. Hence we get S where the geometric carrier |S| is 2-disk. The boundary ∂|S| is a cycle which contains all the vertices of M. Therefore, we get a cycle which contains all the vertices of M. In Figure 3, the cycle ∂|S| is C(v1, v9, v20, v13, v21, v14, v10, v15, v22, v16, v11, v17, v23, v18, v19, v12, v8, v7, v6, v5, v24, v4, v3, v2).

Let t  >  2 and t is an even integer. We consider the cycles Ci and Ci + 1 where i is an odd integer. Now we use similar idea of (2). Hence we get a 2-disk, say Di. We do it for all odd integer i where [formula]. Hence we get 2-disks D1, D3, , Dt - 1. Let Di and Di + 2 be two 2-disks where i is an odd integer. Let F1,F2 be two faces. We denote |{F1,F2}| is geometric carrier of the set {F1,F2}. Now there are two faces 6-gon, say Fi,6 and 3-gon, say Fi,3 between Di and Di + 2 such that [formula] is an edge for t∈{i,i + 2}. The geometric carrier of {Fi,3,Fi,6,Di,Di + 2} is a 2-disk, say Di,i + 2. Also [formula]. We do it for any two consecutive 2-disks Di, Di + 2 for [formula]. Hence we get a 2-disk, say [formula]. Which is contractible and contains all the vertices of M.

Let t  >  2 and t is an odd integer. We follow (3) for [formula]. We get a 2-disk, say D. Next we follow (1) with the cycle Ct in place of C1. Hence we get a cycle C which contains all the vertices of Ct and the vertices other than V(D) which are belongs to 3-gons and adjacent to Ct. Now there are two faces 6-gon, say f6, and 3-gon, say f3, between C and D such that [formula] and [formula] are two edges. This gives a cycle which is concatenation of ∂D and C by ∂|{f3,f6}|. Hence we get a cycle which contains all the vertices of M.

Therefore, the map of type {6,3,6,3} is Hamiltonian [formula]

Map of type {34,6}

Let M be a map of type {34,6}. We define paths as follows :

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path in M. We denote three paths Q1(wi  →  wi + 1  →  wi + 2  →  wi + 3) (see Figure 4), Q2(vi  →  vi + 1  →  vi + 2  →  vi + 3) (see Figure 5) and Q3(zi  →  zi + 1  →  zi + 2  →  zi + 3) where link(wi) = C(wi - 1, x2,wi + 1, i + 2, 3, 4, x5, x6), link(wi + 1) = C(wi, x2, x7, x9, wi + 2, 3, 4, 5), link(wi + 2) = C(wi + 1, x8, x9, wi + 3, x3, 4, 5, i,), link(wi + 3) = C(wi + 2, x9, wi + 4, i + 5, 10, 11, x12,x3), link(vi) = C(vi - 1, y1,y2, y3, vi + 1, 4, 5, 6), link(vi + 1) = C(vi, y3, y7, vi + 2, y4, 5, 6, i - 1), link(vi + 2) = C(vi + 1, v7, vi + 3, i + 4, 11, 12, y8, w4,), link(vi + 3) = C(vi + 2, y7, y9, y10, vi + 4, 11, 12,8), link(zi) = C(zi - 1, r3,r4, zi + 1, r12, 13, 14,i - 2), link(zi + 1) = C(zi, r4, zi + 2, i + 3, 9, 10, 11, r12), link(zi + 2) = C(zi + 1, r4, r5, r6, zi + 3, 9, 10, 11,) and link(zi + 3) = C(zi + 2, r6, r7, zi + 4, r9, 10, 11,i + 1). A path P is said to be well defined if we consider a path of length three, say L(ut  →  ut + 1  →  ut + 2  →  ut + 3) in P or in the extended path of P then either L  ↦  Q1 by uj  ↦  wj or L  ↦  Q2 by uj  ↦  vj or L  ↦  Q3 by uj  ↦  zj for j∈{t,t + 1,t + 2,t + 3}. In Figure 6, [formula]. We denote this path by Y1.

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path in M. We denote three paths Q1(wi  →  wi + 1  →  wi + 2  →  wi + 3), Q2(vi  →  vi + 1  →  vi + 2  →  vi + 3) and Q3(zi  →  zi + 1  →  zi + 2  →  zi + 3) where link(wi) = C(wi - 1, x2,wi + 1, i + 2, 3, 4, x5, x6), link(wi + 1) = C(wi, x2, x7, x9, wi + 2, 3, 4, 5), link(wi + 2) = C(wi + 1, x8, x9, wi + 3, x3, 4, 5, i,), link(wi + 3) = C(wi + 2, x9, wi + 4, i + 5, 10, 11, x12,x3), link(vi) = C(vi - 1, y1,y2, y3, vi + 1, 4, 5, 6), link(vi + 1) = C(vi, y3, y7, vi + 2, y4, 5, 6, i - 1), link(vi + 2) = C(vi + 1, v7, vi + 3, i + 4, 11, 12, y8, w4,), link(vi + 3) = C(vi + 2, y7, y9, y10, vi + 4, 11, 12,8), link(zi) = C(zi - 1, r3,r4, zi + 1, r12, 13, 14,i - 2), link(zi + 1) = C(zi, r4, zi + 2, i + 3, 9, 10, 11, r12), link(zi + 2) = C(zi + 1, r4, r5, r6, zi + 3, 9, 10, 11,) and link(zi + 3) = C(zi + 2, r6, r7, zi + 4, r9, 10, 11,i + 1). A path P is said to be well defined if we consider a path of length three, say L(ut  →  ut + 1  →  ut + 2  →  ut + 3) in P or in the extended path of P then either L  ↦  Q1 by uj  ↦  w2t + 3 - j or L  ↦  Q2 by uj  ↦  v2t + 3 - j or L  ↦  Q3 by uj  ↦  z2t + 3 - j for j∈{t,t + 1,t + 2,t + 3}. In Figure 6, [formula]. We denote this path by Y2.

We consider maximal path of type Yi for i∈{1,2}. It is cycle by the similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. Let [formula] of type Y1 and [formula] of type Y2 be two cycles of same length r. Let ui - 1  →  ui  →  ui + 1 be a sub path of C1 where adjacent 6-gon is on one side and all four 3-gons are on the other side at ui. Similarly, we consider a sub path vj - 1  →  vj  →  vj + 1 of C2 where adjacent 6-gon is on one side and all four 3-gons are on the other side at vj. We define a map which maps ui to vj. Then, by definition [\ref=df4.1], [\ref=df4.2], the vertex ui + 1 maps vj - 1 and ui - 1 maps vj + 1. We extend it to hole cycles. Hence we get ui + t  ↦  vj - t for 0  ≤  t  ≤  r - 1. This map gives the cycles C1 and C2 are of type D1(  =  D2). Therefore, the definition [\ref=df4.1] and [\ref=df4.2] defined same cycle.

Let M be a map. We construct a cylinder using a cycle of type Y1 like done in Section 2. We get a cylinder SCi by a cycle Ci. It's boundary cycles are, say Cl,Ck. By the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.2], length(Ci)  =  length(Cl)  =  length(Ck). Also, by the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.3], the cycles of type Y1 which are homologous to C1 have same length. Its clear from the definition and representation that there are three cycles at each vertex, say v, of type Y1. Let L1(v),L2(v),L3(v) be three cycles at v. We define T(r,s,k) of M by the similar argument of Section 2. In this process, we take second cut along L2 in place of L3 where the starting adjacent face to horizontal base cycle L1 is 3-gon. Hence we get a (r,s,k)-representation of M. The Figure 7 is an example of T(9,6,3) of a map of type {34,6} on 54 vertices. In Figure 7, [formula] and the path v1  →  v10  →  v27  →  v19  →  v28  →  v45  →  v37  →  v46  →  v3 is part of the cycle L2. This T(r,s,k) exists for every M of type {34,6}. Now, we show the map M contains contractible Hamiltonian by theorem [\ref=thm4.1]. Therefore the map of type {34,6} on the torus is Hamiltonian.

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm4.1] Let M be a map of type {34,6} on the torus. We consider a vertex, say v. Its clear from type of M that the vertex v belongs to exactly one 6-gon, say Fv,6. In Figure 7, if we take any Fi and Fj for [formula] then Fi, Fi are disjoint. We choose any two 6-gons, say Fu,6, Fv,6 in M. The faces Fu,6 and Fv,6 are disjoint. We consider all 6-gons of M, say [formula] where [formula] for [formula]. That is, [formula]. Let [formula] be a list of homologous horizontal cycles of type Y1 in T(r,s,k). In Figure 7, s  =  6 and C1  =  C(v1, v2, [formula] v9), C2  =  C(v10, v11, [formula] v18), C3  =  C(v19, v20, [formula] v27), C4  =  C(v28, v29, [formula] v36), C5  =  C(v37, v38, [formula] v45), C6  =  C(v46, v47, [formula] v54). For [formula] and [formula], we consider two cycles Ci,Cj. We denote WC,6 be a set of adjacent 6-gons to C. In Figure 7, WC2,6  =  {F1,F2,F3}. Then its clear from the representation, [formula]. We define a set SCi:  =  {φ}. We choose Ci and consider all adjacent 6-gons in SCi. Let Fu,6, Fv,6 be two consecutive 6-gons adjacent to Ci. Its clear from the representation T(r,s,k), there are two 3-gons, say [formula] such that geometric carrier of [formula] is 2-disk, [formula] is an edge, [formula] is an edge and [formula] for all [formula]. In Figure 7, if we consider F1 and F2 then triangles are [formula], [formula]. We put these two triangles [formula] in Sci. We do it for any two consecutive 6-gons which are adjacent to Ci except first and last one. In Figure 7, if we consider C2 then first and last faces are F1 and F3 respectively. Hence we get a set SCi of 6-gons and 3-gons where the geometric carrier is a 2-disk and bounded by a cycle. Therefore we get a set SCi for cycle Ci where i is even and [formula]. We consider the set [formula]. The set S contains all 6-gons of M. Now, we choose a vertex of Ci0 for a fixed i0 where 1  ≤  i0  ≤  t. We consider a path, say Q of type Y1 vertically which is not homologous to Ci0. Similarly, we choose two adjacent 3-gons on one side of Q, say [formula], between any two consecutive 6-gons adjacent to Ci and Ci + 2 along Q. In Figure 7, Q  =  path(v1  →  v10  →  v27  →  v19  →  v28  →  v45  →  v37  →  v46  →  v3). So, we get [formula] which is 2-disk. We collect all triangle between any two consecutive 6-gons along Q in S. Hence the geometric carrier |S| which is a 2-disk and bounded by a cycle. The set S contains [formula] and |S| is 2-disk. Therefore ∂|S| is a cycle and contains all the vertices of M. Hence the map M contains contractible Hamiltonian cycle. [formula]

Map of type {4,8,8}

Let M be a map of type {4,8,8}. We denote CFl to be a cycle of length l which is boundary of a face Fl. We use this notation in the definition [\ref=df5.1], [\ref=df6.1], [\ref=df7.1] and [\ref=df8.1]. We define a path in M as follows :

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path in M. The path P is said to well defined if it satisfy the following properties :

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length one,

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length three.

For the boundary vertices, we consider the extended path of P.

We denote this path by Z1.

We consider a maximal path of type Z1 which is cycle by the similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. We define a cylinder with two boundaries where boundaries are cycles of type Z1 by the construction done in Section 5. Let Ci be a cycle. Let SCi be a cylinder by Ci. We consider the boundaries of SCi, say Cl,Ck. By the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.2], length(Ci)  =  length(Cl)  =  length(Ck). Let C be a cycle of type Z1 which is homologous to C1. Then, by the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.3], length(C)  =  length(C1). Its clear from the definition [\ref=df5.1] that there are two cycles of type Z1 at a vertex. Therefore, we consider two cycles of type Z1 at a vertex v, say L1(v),L2(v). We define a (r,s,k)-representation of M by similar idea of Section 3. Here we take second cut along cycle L2 where the starting adjacent face to the base horizontal cycle L1 is 4-gon. Hence we get a (r,s,k)-representation of M. Therefore, every map of type {4,8,8} on the torus has T(r,s,k). Now the map M has contractible Hamiltonian cycle by theorem [\ref=thm5.1]. Therefore any map of type {4,8,8} on the torus is Hamiltonian.

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm5.1] Let M be a map. Let [formula] be the list of all homologous horizontal cycles of type Z1 in T(r,s,k) of length, say r. Let [formula], C2(u21, u22, [formula], C3(u31, u32, [formula], , [formula] be the cycles in order, that is, if we consider any consecutive three cycles Ck,Ck + 1 and Ck + 2 then SCk + 1 is a cylinder with ∂SCk + 1  =  {Ck,Ck + 2}. We define a cycle Ci - 1,i:  =  C(ui - 12, [formula] ui - 1r, ui - 11, ui1, uir, uir - 1, [formula] ui2) by Ci - 1 and Ci. The cycle Ci - 1,i is contractible as it bounds a 2-disk which consists of 4-gons and 8-gons. We follow one of the following cases :

Let s be an even integer and the cycle Ci - 1,i for [formula]. We consider two cycles Ci - 1,i, Ci + 1,i + 2 where i is even and adjacent 4-gon CF4(ui3,ui4,ui + 14,ui + 13). Here [formula] and [formula] are two edges. Therefore we define a cycle [formula] [formula] ui - 1r, ui - 11, ui1, uir, uir - 1, [formula] ui + 14, ui + 15, [formula] ui + 1r, ui + 11, ui + 21, ui + 2r, ui + 2r - 1, [formula], ui + 22, ui + 12, ui + 13, ui3, ui2). By this definition we define cycle [formula] which is contractible. It contains all the vertices of [formula]. Therefore M contains a contractible Hamiltonian cycle.

Let s be an odd integer. When s = 1 we define C: = C1. When s  >  1, we have a contractible cycle Ci - 1,i for [formula]. Next we use the idea (1). We define a cycle [formula]. Let F4 be a 4-gon adjacent along an edge with Cs and Cs - 1. We concatenate the cycle C with CF4. We do it for all adjacent 4-gons those are adjacent with Cs and Cs - 1. This gives a cycle which is contractible and contains all the vertices of M. Therefore the map M contains a contractible Hamiltonian cycle. [formula]

Map of type {3,12,12}

Let M be a map of type {3,12,12}. We define a path as follows :

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path. The path P is said to well defined if it follow the following properties :

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length one,

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length three.

For the boundary vertices, we consider extended path of P.

We denote this path by G1.

We consider a maximal path of type G1 which is cycle by similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. Therefore any maximal path of type G1 is cycle. Its clear from the definition [\ref=df6.1] that there are two cycles of type G1 at a vertex. Let L1(v),L2(w),L3(v) be three cycles at v, w where vw is an edge of L1 and belongs to a 3-gon. We define a (r,s,k)-representation of M by similar idea of Section 4. Here we take second cut along a cycle of type G1 where the starting adjacent face to horizontal base cycle L1 is 12-gon. Therefore we get (r,s,k)-representation of M. We give an example [\ref=example2] which is not Hamiltonian by showing that it does not contain any maximal contractible or non-contractible cycle which contains all the vertices of the map M. Therefore the map of type {3,12,12} on the torus is not Hamiltonian.

Example of a map of type {3,12,12} on the torus which is non-Hamiltonian.

Let M be a map which has a representation T(24,2,9). We consider a maximal non contractible cycle of type G1 in T(24,2,9). It contains maximal cycle of length 24 among all possible cycles of type G1. Let [formula] be a cycle of length 24. Now we extend C by concatenate a cycle of length l which bounds a l-gon. The representation T(24,2,9) contains only 12-gons and 3-gons. Therefore we can extend C to a cycle of length 24  +  6  =  30 for a 12-gon. Similarly, we can extend it to a cycle of length 24  +  1  =  25 for a 3-gon. Therefore, the length of the extended cycle of C is, say 24  +  6m1  +  m2 where m1 denotes the number of 12-gons and m2 denotes the number of 3-gons. In Figure 8, we use the notation Fi,12 to denote ith 12-gon. Its clear from Figure 8, we can concatenate the cycles ∂F1,12, ∂F3,12 and ∂F5,12 with C. If we consider any other Fi,12 for [formula] then there will be a vertex which is repetition in the extended cycle. Therefore m1  =  3. Similarly, we have m2  =  15 for 3-gons. Hence the value of 24 + 6m1 + m2 is at most 57 as (24 + 6.3 + 15)  =  (24  +  18  +  15) = 57  <  72. Similarly, if we consider only 3-gons or 12-gons then also we get a cycle of length less than 72.

Next, we consider a non contractible cycle which does not follow the definition {[\ref=df6.1]. We extend this cycle to a cycle of maximal length by concatenating its boundary cycles of adjacent faces. We consider longest cycle among these maximal cycles. We denote it by C. In Figure 8, C: = C(1, 24, 25, 31, 37, 38, 39, 40, 62, 68, 15, 14, 13, 12, 28, 34, 50, 49, 48, 47, 64, 70, 23, 22, 21, 20, 30, 36, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 67, 11, 10, 9, 27, 8, 7, 72, 6, 5, 4, 26, 32, 41, 42, 43, 44, 63, 69, 19, 18, 17, 416, 29, 35, 54, 53, 52, 51, 65, 71, 3, 2) of length 66(  <  72). Therefore T(24,2,9) does not have non contractible Hamiltonian cycle.

We choose a largest contractible cycle in T(24,2,9). We denote DC to be a 2-disk which is bounded by C. Let 2-disk DC1 contains m1 number of 12-gons and m2 number of 3-gons. Then the length of the cycle C1 is 12  +  10(m1 - 1)  +  m2  =  10m1  +  m2  +  2. Now the number of 12-gons can be at most 5, that is, m1  ≤  5 otherwise we get a repetition of vertex in C1. Similarly, the number of 3-gons can be at most 14, that is, m2  ≤  14 as we have at most 14 adjacent 3-gons to any 2-disk which contains five 12-gons. If we consider m1  >  5 or m2  >  14 then we get some vertex which are either inside the 2-disk or repetition in C1. Therefore, the value of 10m1 + m2 + 2 is at most 66 as (10m1 + m2 + 2)  ≤  (50  +  14  +  2)  =  66  <  72. Hence T(24,2,9) does not contain any contractible cycle which is Hamiltonian. Therefore the map T(24,2,9) is not Hamiltonian.

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm6.1] The proof of the theorem [\ref=thm6.1] follows from the example [\ref=example2]. [formula]

Map of type {4,6,12}

Let M be a map of type {4,6,12}. We define a path as follows :

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path in M. The path P is said to be well defined if it follow the following properties :

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length one,

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length three,

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length five.

the boundary vertex of P also well defined in extended path of P.

We denote this path by H1.

We consider a maximal path of type H1. The path is cycle by similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. We define a cylinder with two boundaries where boundaries are cycles of type H1 by the construction done in Section 7. We denote it by SCi for a cycle Ci. Let ∂SCi  =  {Cl,Ck} where Cl,Ck are of type H1. By the lemma [\ref=lem1.2], length(Ci)  =  length(Cl)  =  length(Ck). Now we consider all possible horizontal homologous cycles [formula] of type H1 in M. By the similar argument of lemma [\ref=lem1.3], [formula]. Its clear from the definition [\ref=df7.1] that there are three cycles of type H1 at a vertex. Let L1(v),L2(v),L3(v) be three cycles at v. We define (r,s,k)-representation of M by the similar idea done in Section 2. Here we take second cut along the cycle L3 where the starting adjacent face to base horizontal cycle L1 is 6-gon. Hence we get a (r,s,k)-representation of M. Next we use the similar argument of theorem [\ref=thm4.1]. Here we use the cycle of type H1 and 12-gon and 4-gon in place of 6-gon and 3-gon respectively in the theorem [\ref=thm4.1]. Hence we get a set, say S, of 12-gons and 4-gons. The geometric carrier |S| is a 2-disk which is bounded by Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore the map of type {4,6,12} on the torus is Hamiltonian. [formula]

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm7.1] The proof of the theorem [\ref=thm7.1] follows from the result of this section. [formula]

Map of type {6,4,3,4}

Let M be a map of type {6,4,3,4}. We define a path as follows :

Let P(u1  →  ur) be a path. The P is said to be well defined if it follow the following properties :

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length one,

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length one,

if [formula] then [formula] is a path of length two.

The boundary vertex of P also well defined in extended path of P.

We denote this path by W1.

We define (r,s,k)-representation like done in Section 8 of M. Here we take second cut along L3 where the starting adjacent face to base horizontal cycle L1 is 4-gon. Now we follow the theorem [\ref=thm4.1]. Here we consider the cycles of type W1 and also 4-gon in place of 3-gon. Hence we get a set of 6-gons and 4-gons such that the geometric carrier is bounded by a Hamiltonian cycle. Therefore, the map of type {6,4,3,4} on the torus is Hamiltonian.

Proof of Theorem[\ref=thm8.1] The proof of the theorem [\ref=thm8.1] follows from the result of this section. [formula]
