Introduction

The most known property of a pair of finitely generated subgroups A and B in a free group F is the theorem of Howson ([\cite=Ho], [\cite=LS], I.3.13) saying that the intersection [formula] is also finitely generated. The sharp estimate of the free rank of [formula] in terms of (free) ranks of A and B was recently published by Mineyev [\cite=M]. It confirms the old conjecture of Hanna Neumann [\cite=N].

On the contrary, the subgroup 〈A,B〉 generated by [formula] has finite rank for the obvious reason, and certainly this subgroup can have finite index in F or can just coincide with F when both A and B are "small", that is, have infinite index in F. However we prove in this paper that 〈A,H〉 is still "small" for some subgroup H which is virtually equal to B. More precise formulation is given by

Let A and B be finitely generated subgroups of infinite index in a free group F. Then there is a subgroup H  ≤  B with finite index in B such that the subgroup 〈A,H〉 has infinite index in F.

In addition, for every finite subset [formula], the subgroup H can be chosen so that [formula]

A particular case of Theorem [\ref=2subgr] with a cyclic subgroup B is contained in the theorem 5 of the paper [\cite=BO]. Theorem [\ref=2subgr] is proved in Section [\ref=main]; and in Section [\ref=next], we formulate some corollaries obtained by the iterrated applications of this theorem. The main corollary is

Recall that an action of a group G is faithful if its kernel is trivial. It is called highly transitive if it is k-transitive for every integer k  ≥  1. We call an action locally finite if all the orbits of this action are finite.

Thus we have antipodal properties (1) and (2) of the action [formula] of F. On the one hand, an easy observation shows that the restriction of an infinite transitive action with the property(2) to a subgroup of finite index or to a nontrivial normal subgroup of F cannot be locally finite (see Remark [\ref=Rek]). On the other hand the free group F is saturated by finitely generated subgroups of infinite index. The (r - 1)-generated subgroups, where r is the free rank of F, constitute a minor part of this enormous family.

Preliminaries: coset graphs, cores, and coverings

Let F  =  F(X) be a free group with free basis X. If H is a subgroup of F, then the vertices of the coset graph Γ  =  Γ(H,X) are the right cosets Hg of the subgroup H in F, and for every coset Hg and x∈X±  1, we have an edge e = e(Hg,x) with the initial vertex e-  =  Hg and the terminal vertex e+ = Hgx. The edge e is labeled by Lab(e) = x, while the inverse edge e- 1 is labeled by x- 1, and e- 1- = Hgx, e- 1+ = Hg.

Recall that if ei and ei + 1 are two consecutive edges in a path [formula] of (combinatorial) length n, then (ei + 1)-  =  (ei)+ for [formula]. The path p of Γ is reduced if ei + 1  ≠  e- 1i for [formula]. This is equivalent to saying that the word [formula] is reduced. One defines the initial and the terminal vertices of p by the rules p- = (e1)- and p+ = (en)+. A path p is closed if p- = p+. By the definition of inverse path, we have [formula] For every vertex v, there is a path q of length 0 with q- = q+ = v.

Further, speaking on graphs labeled over some alphabet X, we always imply that for every edge e we have a unique inverse e- 1 with (e- 1)- 1 = e. We see from the definition of the coset graph that it is connected, it has a base point corresponding to the subgroup H, and every vertex v of Γ has a standard star star(v) = starΓ(v), i.e., the set of edges with the initial vertex v has exactly one x-edge (=   the edge labeled by x) for every x∈X±  1. The following converse statement is known.

Let F = F(X) be a free group with free basis X. Then every connected labeled graph Γ with a basepoint, where each vertex v is standard, is the coset graph of a subgroup H  ≤  F, and the base point corresponds to the coset H.

Since every vertex v is standard, for every x∈X, we have a bijection fx on the set of all vertices V: it maps each v to the terminal vertex of the x-edge e∈star(v). Since F is free, the collection of all bijections fx extends to an action [formula] of the entire F on V.

The (right) action [formula] is transitive since Γ is a connected graph. Let H be the stabilizer of the base point o∈Γ. Since for g,g'∈F and for any action [formula], one has [formula] if and only if Hg = Hg', we have obtained the bijection [formula], and the action fx of a free generator x corresponds to the right multiplication by x.

If H  ≤  H1  ≤  F, then for g,g'∈F, the equality Hg = Hg' implies H1g = H1g', and therefore the mapping Hg  ↦  H1g induces a label-preserving surjective graph morphism φH1H:Γ  →  Γ1 of the corresponding coset graphs, preserving the base point. The restriction of the mapping φH1H to every star is bijective because all the labeled stars are standard over the alphabet X±  1. In other words, φH1H is a covering of labeled graphs. Obviously, the multiplicity of this covering (or its index =   the number of preimages of any vertex or edge of Γ1 in Γ) is equal to the number of cosets of H in any coset of H1, i.e., it is equal to the index

[formula]

as this was remarked before the lemma.

Thus we see that a reduced word over the alphabet X±  1 represents an element of H if and only if w is the label of a reduced closed path of the coset graph Γ with origin at the base point o. So one can consider the smallest subgraph C of Γ containing o and containing all the reduced closed paths of Γ originated at o. This labeled graph C = core(H,X) = core(H) with the base point o is called the core of Γ.

It follows from the definition that no vertex of the connected graph C, except for the base point o, has degree ≤  1 in C. (Recall that the degree of a vertex v in a graph C is the number of edges in starC(v).) If the degree of o is 1, then there is a unique maximal path p in C such that p- = o and the degree of every its vertex in C, except for the terminal vertex p+, does not exceed 2. Let us call this path the handle of C. We will suppose that the handle of the core is of length 0 if C has no vertices of degree 1.

So the handle p is attached at p+, to the part [formula] of the core having no vertices of degree 1. Removing the handle from C one obtains the core [formula] with base point p+ for a conjugate subgroup H' = Lab(p)- 1H(Lab(p)).

Note that the notion of core of a graph was introduced by J.Stallings [\cite=S], but our definition is slightly different: Stallings' did not include the handle in the core and considered only the subgraph [formula] but we cannot do this since we may not replace the subgroup by a conjugate one in the next section. Besides, we work only with labeled graphs.

Every reduced word representing an element of H can be read on a unique closed path starting at the base point. This path belongs to the minimal subgraph containing all the closed paths labeled by the reduced words generating H. It follows that the core C is a finite graph if the subgroup H is finitely generated.

A star starC(v) can be smaller than the star starΓ(v) in a bigger graph. However if all the stars of Γ are standard over some labeling alphabet X, then every subgraph E of Γ is regular, i.e. every starE(v) contains at most one x-edge for every x∈X±  1.

Since all the edges of reduced closed paths of the coset graph Γ with origin o belong to the core C and Γ is a connected graph, one obtains Γ by attaching infinite labeled trees T1, [formula] ("hairs" in terminology of [\cite=S]) to different vertices [formula] of C in such a way that exactly one vertex of each tree Ti is identified with a vertex vi of C. One attaches such a tree to vi only if vi is a deficit vertex in the core, i.e. starC(vi) does not contain an x-edge for some x∈X±  1.

In each of the attached trees, all stars starTi(v) of its vertices v are standard, except for the root vertex o(Ti), that coincides with the vertex vi of C. Still the star star(o(Ti)) must be standard in the whole coset graph Γ; so the labeling of the edges of starTi(o(Ti)) must compliment the labeling of the star starC(vi) of the deficit vertex vi in the core. Hence the regular graph core(H) completely determines the coset graph Γ of H up to isomorphism. Furthermore, Lemma [\ref=cogr] and the above reconstruction of Γ from the core by attaching of labeled trees at deficit vertices, prove the following

Let C be a connected regular graph with a base point o, labeled over an alphabet X. If every vertex of C, except for o, has degree at least 2 in C, then C is equal to core(H) with base point o for a subgroup H  ≤  F(X).

[formula]

Now let H be a finitely generated subgroup of F. Since core(H) is a finite graph, the coset graph Γ  =  Γ(H) is finite if and only if it has no trees attached to the core. In other words, the index of a finitely generated subgroup H  ≤  F is finite in F if and only if core(H) has no deficit vertices.

If a connected regular graph Δ labeled over an alphabet X has a deficit vertex, then every its nonempty subgraph E has its own deficit vertex. Moreover if the subgraph E is finite, then either it has at least two distinct deficit vertices or it has a deficit vertex v with deficit > 1, i.e. there are two different letters x,x'∈X±  1 such that starE(v) has neither x- nor x'-edge.

If E is a proper subgraph with standard stars starE(v), then there remain no edges connecting E with the compliment [formula] contrary the connectedness of Δ. This proves the first assertion.

Assume that the subgraph E is finite and has only one deficit vertex v, and the deficit of v in E is 1. Since every standard star has even number of edges, we conclude that the sum of degrees of the vertices of E is odd. This contradicts the fact that the total number of edges in E is even since for every edge e of E, the edge e- 1 also belongs to E. The obtained contradiction proves the lemma.

Main lemmas and proof of Theorem [\ref=2subgr]

Let H be a subgroup of a free group F = F(X) with a free base X, and Γ be the coset graph of H with respect to X. For a subset Y  ⊂  X, let F(Y) denote the subgroup of F generated by Y. A vertex v of a subgraph E  ⊂  Γ will be called a Y-deficit vertex in E if there is y∈Y±  1 such that starE(v) has no edge labeled by y.

We define the Y-frame frame(H,Y) as the maximal connected subgraph of core(H) containing the base point and having all edge labels in Y±  1.

If the subgroup H is finitely generated, has infinite index in F, and it is not contained in F(Y), then H contains a subgroup K of finite index in H such that core(K) has a deficit vertex which does not belong to frame(K,Y).

Assume first that the graph C = core(H) has an edge e such that

(1) the removal of e±  1 from core(H) makes the remaining part C' of C disconnected (let us call such an edge a bridge in C) and

(2) [formula].

Then the graph C' has two connected components D and E, where D contains the base point o of C, and so it contains the whole frame(H,Y) since Lab(e)∉Y±  1. By Lemma [\ref=def], the graph E must have a deficit vertex v which remains to be deficit when one gets the edges e±  1 back, i.e., v is deficit in C. It follows that in core(H), the deficit vertex v is separated from frame(H,Y) by the edges e±  1, and so one may choose K = H.

Thus we may further assume that every bridge of C is labeled by a letter from Y±  1.

Now we can find K as a subgroup of H with arbitrarily prescribed index j  ≥  2. To define K we will construct a coverings f:Δ  →  Γ of index j.

Let [formula] be copies of the coset graph Γ  =  Γ(H) and Ci be the core of Γi for [formula]. Note that C0 has an edge e0 labeled by a letter [formula] because H is not a subgroup of F(Y). The edge e0 is not a bridge in C0 by the above conjecture. Hence one obtains connected graphs after removal of e0 from C0 or from Γ0.

Let e0 connect some vertices u0 and v0 of the graph C0. By ei, ui, and vi we denote the copies of e0, u0, and v0, respectively, in Ci ([formula]).

To define Δ we modify the disjoint union [formula] as follows. Preserving all the vertices and all the edges except for [formula], we redirect each ei. To be exact, we replace it by a new edge e'i with the same label x, but e'i connects ui with vi + 1 (indices are taken modulo j). The edge (e'i)- 1 is redirected respectively.

The obtained graph Δ is connected because for every i, the removal of the edges e±  1i does not break the connectedness of Γi.

By definition, the function f maps every vertex and every non-modified edge of each Γi to its copy in Γ, and f(e'i) is the copy of ei in Γ. Clearly, f is a covering of Γ of index j, and so by lemmas [\ref=cogr] and [\ref=cov], Δ is the coset graph for a subgroup K having index j in H. (In fact K is normal in H with cyclic quotients H / K.)

We choose the vertex oΔ such that f(oΔ) = oΓ and oΔ belongs to C0, as the base point of Δ. Let [formula] ([formula]). Each graph C'i is connected and contains the handle pi of Ci since ei is not a bridge in Ci. Hence the subgraph CΔ of Δ formed by the edges (e'i)±  1 ([formula]) and by the graphs C'0, [formula] without j - 1 handles [formula] is also connected. The graph CΔ has at most one vertex of degree ≤  1 (must be equal to (p0)- = oΔ if any exists), and CΔ contains all reduced closed paths of Δ originated at oΔ because every edge in [formula] belongs to some attached infinite tree. Hence CΔ is equal to core(K).

The degrees of the vertices from C'i in core(K) do not exceed their degrees in Γi. Now recall that H is finitely generated and has infinite index in F; therefore core(H) has a deficit vertex. So every Ci has a deficit vertex which remains to be deficit not only in C'i but also in Δ by Lemma [\ref=def]. So each of the parts [formula] of Δ has a deficit vertex in Δ.

On the other hand, the subgraph frame(K,Y) is contained in C'0 since C'0 is connected with the parts C'1 and C'j - 1 by x-edges (e'0)±  1 and (e'j - 1)±  1 only, where x∉Y±  1. Thus the deficit vertex of Δ belonging to C'1 is the desired one.

Let A and B be finitely generated subgroups of infinite index in a free group F. Then there exist two subgroups A1 and B1 in F such that

(a) A1 is a subgroup of finite index in A;

(b) B1 contains a subgroup B0 having finite index in B;

(c) B1 is finitely generated and contains A1;

(d) the subgroup B1 is of infinite index in F.

Since A is finitely generated, it is a free factor in a subgroup E having finite index in F by the theorem of M.Hall (see [\cite=H], [\cite=LS], I.3.10). Then [formula] has finite index in B, and therefore it suffices to prove the lemma for the pair of subgroup [formula] in the free group E rather than for the pair (A,B) in F. (Now and subsequently we use that a subgroup of a free group is free and a subgroup of finite index in a finitely generated group is finitely generated itself, see [\cite=LS], II,4.2.) So one may assume from the very beginning that A is a free factor of F. In other words, F has a free basis X such that A is freely generated by a finite subset Y  ⊂  X. This subset is proper since the subgroup A is of infinite index in F.

If B  ≤  A = F(Y), then obviously one can put A1 = B1 = A and B0 = B, which proves the lemma. So we will assume that B is not contained in F(Y). By Lemma [\ref=one], B has a subgroup K of finite index such that the subgraph frame(K,Y)) does not contain at least one deficit vertex from core(K). Again one may replace B by K and prove the lemma constructing the pair (A1,B1) for the pair (A,K) rather than for (A,B) since K has finite index in B. Therefore without change of our notation, we may just assume further that frame(B,Y) does not contain at least one deficit vertex from core(B).

Now we are going to embed the graph core(B) in the core of the coset graph of a bigger finitely generated subgroup B1. We will add edges to core(B) as follows. Assume that v is a Y-deficit vertex in frame(B,Y). It is also Y-deficit in core(B) by the definition of Y-frame. Then for some y∈Y±  1, core(B) has no edge terminating at v and labeled by y. It follows that there exists a maximal path q in the subgraph frame(B,Y) (and in core(B)) such that Lab(q) = yn for some n  ≥  0 and q- = v. Then we add a new edge going from q+ to q- and labeled by y. The maximality of q implies that the extended graph is still regular.

By Lemma [\ref=core], after each step of this procedure, we have a core for some subgroup of F. We will keep doing such extensions until the Y-frame has no Y-deficit vertices. There appear only finitely many new edges since we do not add new vertices. Therefore the subgroup B1 given by the extended core is finitely generated, core(B1) contains core(B), and so B1  ≥  B . Since the subgraph frame(B1,Y) has no Y-deficit vertices, it is equal to the core of the subgroup [formula], having finite index in A. (In fact, this argument also proves M.Hall's theorem: [formula] is a free factor of a subgroup A1 having finite index in A.)

Finally, B1 has infinite index in F since our extensions do not touch the deficit vertex of core(B) lying outside of frame(B,Y). Hence the properties (a) - (d) are obtained.

For the next step, we need the following weaker form of Theorem [\ref=2subgr].

Let [formula] be a finite collection of finitely generated subgroups of infinite index in a free group F. Then there exist subgroups [formula] of finite indices in [formula], respectively, such that the subgroup [formula] has infinite index in F.

It follows from the properties (a) - (d) of Lemma [\ref=two] that one can put A' = A1, B' = B0 and obtain the subgroup 〈A',B'〉  ≤  B1 of infinite index in F with A' and B' having finite indices in A and B, respectively. Therefore the subgroups A', B', and 〈A',B'〉 are finitely generated. In turn, there are a subgroup H of finite index in 〈A',B'〉 and a subgroup C' of finite index in C such that 〈H,C'〉 is of infinite index in F. But H contains some subgroups A'' and B'' of finite indices in A' and B', respectively, and so in A and in B. Therefore the subgroup 〈A'',B'',C'〉 also has infinite index in F. Arguing in this way we complete the proof by induction on the number of the subgroups in the finite set [formula]

Let A and B be finitely generated subgroups of infinite index in a free group F. Then there is a subgroup B2 of F such that

(a) B2 is finitely generated;

(b) B2 has infinite index in F;

(c) B2 contains a subgroup H of B having finite index in B;

(d) the normalizer of B2 in F contains A.

Let A1 and B1 be the subgroups of F given by Lemma [\ref=two]. We choose some (finite) left transversal [formula] of A1 in A and define Li = aiB1a- 1i (i = 1,...,m). By Corollary [\ref=cor], there are subgroups [formula] with finite indices

Corollaries for the actions of free groups

(a) Let [formula] be an enumeration of all finitely generated subgroups having infinite index in F. Let us put R1 = L1. For i > 1, by induction, we define Ri  =  〈Ri - 1,Hi〉, where Hi is a subgroup of finite index in Li such thar Ri is a finitely generated subgroup of infinite index in F. Such a choice of Hi is possible by Theorem [\ref=2subgr] since by the inductive hypothesis, Ri - 1 is a finitely generated subgroup of infinite index in F.

Now we define [formula]. We see that R is a union of the members of the increasing series of the subgroups Ri-s having infinite index in F. Hence the subgroup R has infinite index in F itself because F is finitely generated, and so is every subgroup of finite index in F. Since for every i, the subgroup R contains a subgroup Hi of finite index in Li, the statement (a) is proved.

(b) To prove the second statement we need one more lemma.

For every nontrivial normal subgroup N of a free group [formula] of finite rank r  ≥  2, there exists an r-generated subgroup H of infinite index in F such that F = HN.

We will apply a small cancellation argument. Let w be a non-trivial reduced word representing an element of N. Its length is denoted by |w|. There exist 2r positive words [formula] in the alphabet X such that each of them has length at least 10|w|, and arbitrary subword of length ≥  |ui| / 10 of any ui does not occur as a subword in uj for j  ≠  i and has a unique occurrence in ui (see the examples in [\cite=LS], V.10).

Let vi be the reduced form of the product u2i - 1wu- 12i - 1xiu2iwu- 12i ([formula]). Clearly, [formula] modulo N, and so F = NH for the subgroup [formula] It easily follows from the choice of the words uj-s that the reduced form of the product u- 12i - 1xiu2i starts (respectively, ends) with a prefix of u- 12i - 1 (with a suffix of u2i) of length at least [formula] (at least [formula] Similarly, vi starts (ends) with a prefix of u2i - 1 (with a suffix of u- 12i) of length at least [formula] (at least [formula] Therefore if two words v±  1i and v±  1j are not mutually inverse, then the cancellations in their products affect less than 1 / 4 of the letters of each of them. Hence the subgroup H is freely generated by the words v1,...,vr.

The same small cancellation argument shows that no product of the generators of H is equal to one of the free generators x1,...,xr of F, that is H is a proper subgroup of H. Since by Schreier's formula (see [\cite=LS],I.3.9), the free rank of every proper subgroup of finite index in F is strictly greater than r, the subgroup H must have infinite index in F, and the lemma is proved.

To finish the proof of the statement (b) we may assume that the free rank r of F is at least 2. Assume that the subgroup R contains a nontrivial subgroup N normal in F. Let H be the finitely generated subgroup of infinite index in F provided by Lemma [\ref=H]. Since R contains N and, by (a), it contains a subgroup of finite index from H, we conclude that R has finite index in F because F = HN. The obtained contradiction with the property (a) completes the proof of (b).

The following reformulation of Corollary [\ref=R] in terms of the actions of F answers the question raised in Open Problem 3 of [\cite=BO].

(a) Let F act by right translations on the set S of right cosets of the subgroup R provided by Corollary [\ref=R]. Then S is infinite and the action on F is transitive. An L-orbit (Rg)L of a point Rg with respect to the action of a finitely generated subgroup L with infinite

, which is finite by Corollary [\ref=R]. The local finiteness is proved.

(b) The stabilizer R of any point v must have infinite index in F since F transitively acts on an infinite set. Since the restriction of the action [formula] to every finitely generated subgroup H of infinite index is locally finite, the H-orbit [formula] is finite. Since the size of this orbit is equal to
