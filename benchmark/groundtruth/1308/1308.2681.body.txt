Introduction

Ultraviolet absorption lines in the spectra of background sources represent the most sensitive available means of observing the diffuse gas that permeates the universe. The O VI λλ1031, 1037 doublet in particular has received attention as a tracer of: the warm-hot phase of the intergalactic medium [\citep=Cen:1999], the galaxy outflows thought to be responsible for the chemical enrichment of the IGM [\citep=Oppenheimer:2006], and the intra-group medium [\citep=Mulchaey:1996]. While independent surveys of O VI absorbers in the spectra of distant quasars have uncovered a large number of these systems supporting the notion of O VI doublets being a sensitive tracer of warm-hot gas, the reported number density of O VI absorbers from different surveys shows a scatter much beyond the individual measurement errors [\citep=Burles:1996] [\citep=Tripp:2000] [\citep=TrippSavage:2000] [\citep=Prochaska:2004] [\citep=Richter:2004] [\citep=Tripp:2008] [\citep=Thom:2008a] [\citep=Danforth:2008] [\citep=Tilton:2012]. At the same time, cosmological simulations incorporating momentum-driven winds have been able to reproduce the observed O VI absorption column density distribution function, but ambiguity remains in attributing the majority of low-redshift O VI absorbers to either cool, photoionized gas [\citep=Kang:2005] [\citep=Oppenheimer:2009] [\citep=Oppenheimer:2012] or the warm-hot phase of the IGM [\citep=Smith:2011] [\citep=Tepper:2011] [\citep=Cen:2012] [\citep=Stinson:2012].

Key insights into the physical origin of O VI absorbers can be gained from a detailed examination of their galactic environments. Observations designed to constrain the properties of gaseous halos of known galaxies have shown that emission-line galaxies exhibit near unity O VI covering fractions (κO  VI) at projected distances [formula] kpc and κO  VI  ≈  64% at ρ  <  350 kpc, while absorption-line galaxies exhibit [formula]% on similar scales [\citep=Chen:2009] [\citep=Tumlinson:2011]. The large incidence of O VI absorbers around star-forming galaxies may be explained by a causal connection between star formation and the production of O VI absorbing gas, but the non-negligible covering fraction of such gas around an evolved galaxy population becomes difficult to explain under the same scenario.

While surveys of galaxies associated with known O VI absorbers have revealed a correlation between the presence of star-forming galaxies and O VI absorbers at modest projected separations [formula] kpc [\citep=Stocke:2006] [\citep=Prochaska:2006] [\citep=Chen:2009] [\citep=Mulchaey:2009] [\citep=Wakker:2009] [\citep=Stocke:2013], the galaxy survey data are not sufficiently deep and complete for a detailed examination of the galactic environment immediate to the absorbers. Dedicated surveys around UV bright quasar sightlines are typically limited to bright galaxies with R-band magnitudes brighter than AB(R)  ≈  19.5 limiting sensitivity to L  ≈  0.1  L* galaxies at [formula] [\citep=Prochaska:2011survey]. Although the study of [\cite=Wakker:2009] includes galaxies fainter than L = 0.1  L* at z < 0.02, the incompleteness of their galaxy catalog is unknown. Survey incompleteness complicates the interpretation of the galaxy-absorber studies [\citep=Stocke:2006] [\citep=Stocke:2013]. To date, a high completeness level (>  95%) for galaxies of [formula] and [formula] from the quasar sightline has been reached in only one quasar field (HE 0226-  4110 in Chen & Mulchaey 2009). To improve the statistics, our group is continuing the effort to collect high-completeness galaxy survey data in multiple quasar fields.

In this paper, we present new galaxy survey data obtained for the field around PKS 0405-  123 at zQSO = 0.57. Our galaxy survey in this field has reached 100% completeness within ρ = 200 kpc of the quasar sightline for galaxies as faint as 0.1  L* (0.2  L*) out to redshifts of [formula] (z  ≈  0.5). PKS 0405-  123 is among the brightest quasars on the sky, for which high-quality UV echelle data have been obtained using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph [\citep=Woodgate:1998] and extremely high-quality UV spectra have been obtained using the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph [\citep=Green:2012] on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The intermediate redshift of the quasar provides a long redshift path length for probing intervening absorption systems. Previous systematic searches in the STIS and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer [\citep=Moos:2000] spectra have uncovered six O VI absorption systems at zO  VI = 0.09 - 0.5 [\citep=Prochaska:2004] [\citep=Howk:2009] and 11 additional strong Lyα absorbers of neutral hydrogen column density log   N(H  I)  ≥  13.6 at zH  I = 0.03 - 0.5 [\citep=Williger:2006] [\citep=Lehner:2007]. Recent targeted searches in the new COS spectra have further uncovered a Ne VIII absorber associated with the strong O VI absorber at z = 0.495 [\citep=Narayanan:2011] and a new component associated with the previously known O VI absorber at z = 0.167 [\citep=Savage:2010].

To complement the available highly complete galaxy survey data, we have carried out a new systematic search of absorption features in the new COS spectra. Here we discuss new insights into the origin of O VI absorbing gas that we have learned from combining the improved absorption-line measurements and highly complete galaxy survey data. The paper proceeds as follows: In Section [\ref=section:data] we present the full archival COS spectrum of PKS 0405-  123 and new galaxy redshifts in our survey. In Section [\ref=section:new_abs] we review measurements of the absorbers enabled by the COS spectrum including (1) a tentative detection of an O VI absorber at z = 0.2977, (2) a new O VI absorber at z = 0.3615, and (3) N V associated with a known O VI absorber at z = 0.3633. In Section [\ref=section:environments] we discuss the galaxy environments of all seven O VI absorbers along this sightline and compare them to the galaxy environments of strong Lyα  absorbers with no detected O VI. Finally, in Section [\ref=section:discussion], we briefly discuss the implications of our findings.

Throughout the paper, we adopt a Λ cosmology with Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and H0  =  70 km  s- 1  Mpc- 1. We also adopt a non-evolving, rest-frame absolute R-band magnitude (AB) of MR *  =   - 21.17 for L* galaxies based on [\cite=Blanton:2003]. Unless otherwise stated, we perform k-corrections using the Scd galaxy template from [\cite=Coleman:1980].

Data

PKS 0405-  123 is a well-studied sightline with available imaging and UV spectroscopic data in the FUSE and HST archives [\citep=Chen:2000] [\citep=Prochaska:2004] [\citep=Williger:2006] [\citep=Lehner:2007]. Different galaxy surveys have been carried out in this field identifying galaxies associated with absorption-line systems uncovered in the UV spectra [\citep=Spinrad:1993] [\citep=Ellingson:1994] [\citep=Chen:2005] [\citep=Prochaska:2006] [\citep=Chen:2009]. Recently, PKS 0405-  123 was targeted for HST/COS UV spectroscopy at significantly higher S / N than the archival STIS spectra. This new data set led to the discovery of an interesting O VI absorber with no detectable H I at Δv  ≈   - 300 km  s- 1  from a previously detected O VI absorber in a partial Lyman-limit system at z  =  0.1671 [\citep=Savage:2010]. We have analyzed the full COS spectrum of PKS 0405-  123 (Figure [\ref=figure:COS]) together with new and existing galaxy survey data for a comprehensive study of the galactic environments of absorbing clouds uncovered along this quasar sightline.

COS spectroscopy

PKS 0405-  123 was targeted for COS observations by two separate HST programmes (PI: Keith Noll, PID=  11508 and PI: James Green, PID=  11541). The two programs together acquired 17 exposures, totaling 22.2 ks with the G130M grating (covering the spectral range 1150 - 1450 Å  and with full width at half-maximum spectral resolution of FWHM = 16 km  s- 1), and 4 exposures, totaling 11.1 ks with the G160M grating (1400 - 1800 Å, FWHM = 16 km  s- 1). The exposures were acquired at different central wavelengths in order to provide contiguous wavelength coverage despite the gap between COS detectors. We retrieved the 1-D individual calibrated spectra from the HST archive and combined them using a custom suite of software (see [\citealt=Yoon:2012] for details). Specifically, individual spectra from the two detector segments were aligned and co-added using a common Milky Way absorption line as a reference (e.g., Si III 1206) and then combined into a single one-dimensional spectrum. These co-addition routines work with photon counts rather than flux calibrated data to allow for an accurate error estimate in the low-count regime [\citep=Gehrels:1986]. A well-known issue with far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra obtained using COS is the presence of fixed-pattern noise due to the grid-wire in the COS FUV detectors. Such pattern noise can be reduced by the use of multiple FP-POS settings (see the COS Instrument Handbook). As described above, PKS 0405-  123 was observed by two different programs and in many exposures of different FP-POS settings. The effect of such fixed-pattern noise is therefore minimal in the final stack. To ensure consistency with previous results, we set a common zero-point by aligning the co-added COS spectrum with the archival FUSE and STIS spectra prior to combination of the G130M and G160M data. This alignment led to minor (≪  FWHM) higher-order corrections to the COS wavelength calibration. By comparing the COS spectrum with the archival STIS spectrum, we estimate that errors in the wavelength calibration limit the accuracy of line-centroids to ≈  4 km  s- 1.

The resulting high resolution spectrum (see Figure [\ref=figure:COS]) enabled the new detections of O VI systems in addition to a number of other lines and significantly stronger upper limits on key ions. The new detections are discussed in detail in Section [\ref=section:new_abs].

Galaxy Survey

Previous spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in the PKS 0405-  123 field reached ≈  80% completeness within a 3' radius of the quasar sightline for galaxies brighter than R = 21 and ≈  50% for galaxies between R = 21 and 22 (e.g. [\citealt=Chen:2009]). These surveys identified galaxies associated with half of the known O VI absorbers along this quasar sightline; however, a detailed study of the galaxy environments that includes sub-L* galaxies requires a higher survey completeness at fainter magnitudes. To improve the survey depth, we acquired new galaxy spectra with the Magellan telescopes using the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera & Spectrograph [\citep=Dressler:2011] and the Low Dispersion Survey Spectrograph 3 (LDSS3) (see Table [\ref=table:observations] for a summary of the observations). In addition, we confirmed a number of photometric stars using the Dual Imaging spectrograph (DIS) on the Apache Point 3.5-m. The IMACS and LDSS3 data were reduced using the Carnegie Observatories System for MultiObject Spectroscopy (COSMOS) as described in [\cite=Chen:2009]. The APO DIS spectra were reduced using a slightly modified version of the Low-REDUX pipeline written by J. Hennawi, S. Burles, and J. X. Prochaska. Galaxy redshifts were determined both by cross-correlation with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [\citep=York:2000] templates and by fitting of galaxy eigenspectra as in [\cite=Chen:2009]. In nearly all cases, the two independently determined redshifts were in good agreement (|Δz|  ≤  0.0003), but in the small number of cases for which they were not, SDJ and HWC determined the best redshift by refitting and visual inspection. All assigned redshifts were visually inspected to determine their reliability and galaxy spectra were further classified as either absorption-line dominated or emission-line dominated. The final object catalog is presented in Table [\ref=table:galaxies].

The new IMACS/LDSS3 observations include 225 new galaxies without previously known redshifts, providing an unprecedented level of completeness in the field when combined with previous surveys. Specifically, the survey is 100% ([formula]%) complete for galaxies brighter than R = 22 (R = 23) within 1' of the quasar sightline. The relevant figure-of-merit, however, is the completeness as a function of galaxy luminosity, physical impact parameter, and redshift which is shown in Figure [\ref=figure:completeness] along with a galaxy-redshift histogram. The survey is 100% complete for L > 0.1  L* galaxies at impact parameters less than ρ = 100 kpc and > 90% complete at ρ < 200 kpc at all redshifts z < zQSO. The completeness level decreases somewhat at larger impact parameters due to our targeting priority, but even at ρ < 500 kpc, the survey is [formula]% complete for L > 0.1  L* galaxies at z < zQSO. The high level of completeness is visually captured by the HST image of the field labelled with galaxy redshifts (Figure [\ref=figure:hst]).

We note that in addition to the many foreground galaxies spectroscopically identified near the quasar line-of-sight, there exists a clear overdensity of galaxies at the redshift of the quasar. The galaxy catalog is therefore also valuable for studying AGN fueling (e.g. Ellingson & Yee 1994).

New measurements of absorption-line systems

The higher S / N of the new COS data ensured both improved measurements of previously known transitions and new detections along the sightline. We conducted a systematic search of new absorption features in the COS spectra of PKS 0405-  123 and identified three features that were previously unknown. These include: (1) a tentative detection of a new O VI absorber at z = 0.2977, (2) a new O VI component at Δ  v =  + 170 km  s- 1 from a previously known metal-line absorber at z = 0.3608, and (3) N V absorption associated with a known O VI system at z  =  0.3633. Combining previous results with the new findings yielded a sample of seven O VI absorbers and 12 individual components found at z = 0.0918 - 0.495 along the sightline toward PKS 0405-  123.

We measured the line profiles of both new and known O VI absorbers, as well as their associated H I and other metal transitions based on a Voigt profile analysis using the VPFIT package [\citep=Carswell:1987] and the empirical COS line spread function (LSF). The COS LSF exhibits broad wings which contain up to 40% of the flux [\citep=Ghavamian:2009]. The use of the empirical LSF in the Voigt profile fitting is therefore necessary in order to properly account for the absorption that falls in the wings of the LSF. In cases of line blending, we employed a simultaneous fit of a minimum number of separate components that are necessary to produce a reasonable χ2 value. For non-detections, we calculated the 3-σ rest-frame equivalent width limit over a 300 km  s- 1 spectral window (significantly broader than the wings of the COS LSF) and converted this to the corresponding 3-σ limit in column density assuming that the gas is optically thin. The results are summarized in Table [\ref=table:oviabsorbers], where we list for each species the velocity offset Δ  v relative to the systemic redshift of each absorber zsys as defined by the dominant H I component, the Doppler parameter b, and the best-fit column density. We also include in Table [\ref=table:oviabsorbers] measurements from the literature for completeness. Here we briefly describe the properties of newly detected absorption features.

At z = 0.1826 and 0.1829, two O VI components were found in previous searches [\citep=Prochaska:2004] [\citep=Thom:2008a]. We confirm both detections and remeasure the absorber properties with a simultaneous fit of both components in the COS data. The lower-redshift O VI component is characterized by an O VI column density log   N(O  VI) = 13.75  ±  0.02 and Doppler width b  =  32  ±  3 km  s- 1, and is merely ≈  9 km  s- 1 offset from a previously identified H I absorption component with log   N(H  I) = 14.69  ±  0.01 and b  =  33  ±  1 km  s- 1. The higher-redshift O VI component is characterized by log   N(O  VI)  =  13.88  ±  0.02 and b = 21  ±  1 km  s- 1. No other ions have been detected with a 3-σ upper limit of log   N < 12.8 for both N V and Si IV absorption. [\cite=Prochaska:2004] reported an upper limit of log   N < 12.4 for C III absorption. The best-fit Voigt profiles of the O VI doublet along with those of Lyα and Lyβ absorption are presented in the left column of Figure [\ref=figure:newAbsorbers]).

At z = 0.2977, we report a tentative detection of an O VI absorber at Δ  v  ≈  8 km  s- 1 from a previously identified Lyα absorber. The O VI absorption profile is relatively broad with log   N(O  VI)  =  13.61  ±  0.02 and b  ≈  60 km  s- 1. The λ  1037 member is detected at a ≈  7-σ level of significance, but the model slightly over-predicts the absorption strength of this weaker member which appears to be contaminated by other absorption features. No other metal absorption is detected in the COS spectrum. Our Voigt profile analysis shows that the Lyα transition is best described by two components separated by Δ  v = 65 km  s- 1, with one component containing log   N(H  I) = 13.89  ±  0.05 at z = 0.2976 and the other containing log   N(H  I) = 13.34  ±  0.2 at z = 0.2979. The best-fit Voigt profiles of the O VI doublet along with those of Lyα and Lyβ absorption are presented in the middle-left column of Figure [\ref=figure:newAbsorbers]).

At z  =  0.3615, we also report the detection of a new O VI component with log   N(O  VI)  =  13.80  ±  0.01 and b = 30  ±  1 km  s- 1 at Δ  v  =   + 170 km  s- 1 from a previously known absorption complex at z  =  0.3608 (e.g. Prochaska et al. 2004). Similar to the O VI absorber at z = 0.1829, we do not detect additional metal-line systems associated with this new O VI component. There is possible O VI absorption at [formula] with [formula] detected in the COS spectrum, but it cannot be confirmed due to contaminating features at the location of the second doublet member. The best-fit Voigt profiles of the O VI doublet along with those of Lyα and Lyβ absorption are presented in the middle-right column of Figure [\ref=figure:newAbsorbers]).

Finally, the O VI absorption system previously identified at z = 0.3633 with [formula] and b = 10  ±  1 km  s- 1 displays possible presence of associated N V doublet in the new COS spectrum. Prochaska et al. (2004) identified H I, O IV, N IV, and C III absorption associated with this O VI absorber, although the H I absorbing component is Δ  v =  + 20 km  s- 1 away from the O VI absorber. We confirm the presence of C III absorption with [formula] and detect N V with N(N  V)  =  13.01  ±  0.08 at the redshift of the O VI absorber. The measurements were obtained based on a simultaneous fit of Voigt profiles to all three transitions, assuming that these ions originate in the same gas. Allowing independent fits to the line centroids of N V and C III does not improve the model-fit. The best-fit Voigt profiles of Lyα , C III λ  977, O VI λ  1031 and N V λ  1238 are presented in the right column of Figure [\ref=figure:newAbsorbers]). Both O5 + and N4 + are highly ionized species, whereas C2 + is at a much lower ionization state. The presence of these ions together strongly support a photo-ionization scenario for the absorbing gas (see [\citealt=Prochaska:2004]). Based on the observed relative abundance of C2 + and O5 +, [\citealt=Prochaska:2004] derived an ionization parameter of log   U =  - 1.4  ±  0.2 and a minimum metallicity of solar for the absorbing gas assuming that all of the observed N(H  I) is associated with the O VI absorbing gas. Including the tentative detection of an O VI absorber at z = 0.2977, we have a total of seven O VI absorbers along the sightline toward PKS 0405-  123. In addition, this sightline contains additional 11 strong Lyα absorption systems of log   N(H  I) > 13.6 [\citep=Williger:2006] [\citep=Lehner:2007] with no detectable absorption from heavy ions. The high S / N of the COS spectrum enables stronger limits [\citep=Prochaska:2004] on the associated O VI column densities. We define a subsample of "Lyα-only" absorbers of these strong Lyα absorbers with no associated O VI absorption to a sensitive upper limit. The properties of these Lyα-only systems are summarized in Table [\ref=table:hiabsorbers].

The galaxy environments of O VI and Lyα-only Absorber

The highly complete survey data of faint galaxies in the field around PKS 0405-  123 offer a new opportunity to re-examine the galaxy environments of O VI absorbers. In particular, we compare our findings with previous results from a shallower survey which concluded that O VI absorbers trace a diverse set of environments including: the halos of individual galaxies, galaxy groups, filamentary-like structures, and galaxy voids [\citep=Prochaska:2006]. In addition, we compare the galaxy environments of the O VI absorbers with those of Lyα-only absorbers which constitutes a control sample in seeking the discriminating galactic features that result in the observed O VI absorbing gas at large galactic radii. Throughout, we associate galaxies with absorbers provided the projected line-of-sight velocity between the absorber and the galaxy is |Δv|  <  300 km  s- 1. All galaxies spectroscopically identified at impact parameter ρ < 1 Mpc and velocity offset |Δv|  <  300 km  s- 1   of the O VI and Lyα-only systems are presented in Tables [\ref=table:galaxies_OVI] and [\ref=table:galaxies_HI], respectively.

The galactic environments of O VI absorbers uncovered in our survey are presented in Figure [\ref=figure:environments]. We find that O VI primarily traces over-dense galaxy environments with at least one emission-line galaxy found within ρ  ≈  300 kpc. Specifically, the O VI absorber at z = 0.0918 was originally attributed to filamentary structure connecting three galaxy groups at ρ = 1 - 3 Mpc (Prochaska et al. 2006). However, we have uncovered four dwarf, emission-line galaxies at ρ  ≤  300 kpc, the closest of which is at ρ = 70 kpc and Δv  =   + 140 km  s- 1. Similarly, the absorbers at z  ≈  0.3608 had been attributed to the intragroup medium of a group of passive galaxies found at ρ = 1 - 3 Mpc. Our survey has revealed a dwarf emission-line galaxy (L = 0.08  L* at ρ = 320 kpc and Δv  ≈  0 km  s- 1) in addition to the known massive absorption-line galaxy previously found at ρ = 230 kpc. The only intriguing exception is the O VI absorption system at [formula], which exhibits two strong components separated by 70 km  s- 1. This O VI absorber does not have an associated galaxy at ρ < 300 kpc. Our galaxy survey rules out the presence of any galaxies of L > 0.04  L* at ρ < 250 kpc and the presence of any galaxies of L > 0.3  L* at ρ < 1 Mpc. The lack of galaxies found in the vicinity suggests that this metal-enriched absorber resides in an apparent void. Finally, the O VI absorber at z = 0.495 with associated Ne VIII doublet (Narayanan et al. 2011) is found to be associated with an emission-line galaxy at ρ = 110 kpc (Chen & Mulchaey 2009). Our new survey has not uncovered any additional galaxies in the vicinity of the absorber. We are able to rule out the presence of any galaxies with L > 0.1  L* at ρ < 200 kpc.

We also present in Figure [\ref=figure:environments] the galaxy environments of O VI and Lyα-only absorbers. Considering the increasing survey incompleteness of faint (< 0.1  L*) galaxies with increasing redshift, we separate the galaxy-absorber sample into four redshift bins. For each redshift bin, we show the spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies around O VI absorbers in the left column and Lyα-only absorbers in the right column. Each panel is centered at the quasar, while galaxy positions are marked with circles for emission-line galaxies and triangles for absorption-line galaxies. The symbols are color-coded to indicate the line-of-sight velocity between each galaxy and the absorber. The symbol size specifies galaxy luminosity as shown in the figure legend. To help visualize the surface density of surrounding galaxies, we also introduce a gray-scale showing luminosity-weighted galaxy surface density where each galaxy is represented by a Gaussian with FWHM = 300 kpc.

A qualitative finding based on Figure [\ref=figure:environments] is that a larger fraction of Lyα-only absorbers appear in underdense or relatively isolated galaxy environments in comparison to those of O VI absorbers. Considering all the absorbers together, six of the seven O VI absorption systems at z < 0.5 along the sightline are associated with at least one galaxy with [formula] kpc. Four of the six O VI absorption systems at z < 0.4 are found in a group of multiple galaxies with [formula] kpc. In contrast, of the 11 additional Lyα-only absorbers, only three have associated galaxies found at ρ < 300 kpc.

To quantify the potential difference in the observed galactic environments between O VI and Lyα-only absorbers, we perform two separate tests in the following discussion. First, we examine the mean radial profiles of galaxy properties averaged over all systems in each subsample. Second, we examine the distribution of galaxy properties within each subsample. In both tests, the comparisons are based on both the surface density of the galaxies and the surface brightness of star light.

Do O VI and Lyα-only absorbers share similar azimuthally averaged galaxy distributions out to 1 Mpc?

To determine whether or not O VI and Lyα-only absorbers occur in similar galaxy environments, we measure the mean radial profile of the galaxy distribution around these absorbers by first stacking the observed 2D distribution of galaxies around individual absorbers shown in Figure [\ref=figure:environment] and then computing an azimuthal average in annuli with increasing radius. The left panel of Figure [\ref=figure:average] displays the mean galaxy surface density profiles around O VI absorbers (dashed line) and Lyα-only absorbers (solid line). Error-bars show our estimate of uncertainties due to counting statistics [\citep=Gehrels:1986]. It is clear that there exists an overdensity of galaxies within a ρ  ≈  500 kpc radius of O VI absorbers, which is not seen around Lyα-only absorbers.

Such distinction between O VI and Lyα-only absorbers is also seen in the observed mean surface brightness profiles around these absorbers (the right panel of Figure [\ref=figure:average]). In this case, error-bars are computed using a jackknife resampling technique to estimate uncertainties due to sample variance. While the mean galaxy surface brightness profile around O VI absorbers exhibits a steep rise of ΔμR  ≈   + 5  mag  Mpc -  2 toward the inner regions at [formula] kpc, only a mild increase of ΔμR  ≈   + 2  mag  Mpc -  2 is seen in the galaxy surface brightness profile around Lyα-only absorbers.

Do O VI and Lyα-only absorbers share similar galaxy distribution functions in the inner 500 kpc?

The exercise presented in § [\ref=section:radial] shows that the ensemble average of the radial profiles of galaxy surface density and surface brightness exhibit different characteristics at [formula] kpc between O VI and Lyα-only absorbers. Here we focus on the inner regions of ρ = 500 kpc radius around individual absorbers and examine whether there is a difference in the variation of galaxy properties within each subsample. This exercise provides further insights into the immediate galactic environments of individual absorbers.

The left panel of Figure [\ref=figure:ensemble] shows the cumulative fraction of absorbers originating in environments of no more than Ngal galaxies. It shows that while 16% of O VI absorbers occur in environments where no galaxies are found within a radius of ρ = 500 kpc, more than 50% of Lyα-only absorbers occur in such "voids". However, the samples are small and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test shows that the probability that both types of absorbers are drawn from a similar underlying environment distribution is 20%.

Next, we examine the mean surface density of star light averaged over the area within 500 kpc radius in units of rest-frame R-band magnitude per square Mpc. This quantity allows us to account for missing galaxies that are too faint to be detected in our survey by including the survey limit in our analysis. Including non-detections, the right panel of Figure [\ref=figure:ensemble] shows the maximum possible cumulative fraction of absorbers arising in environments with mean galaxy surface brightness fainter than the designated value μR. Similar to the surface density plot in the left panel, we find that as much as 60% of Lyα-only absorbers originate in environments with galaxy surface brightness fainter than than μR  ≈   - 19  mag  Mpc -  2, while no more than 35% of O VI absorbers are found in such low surface brightness environments. A KS test shows that there is at most 8% probability that O VI and Lyα-only absorbers trace the same underlying galaxy population.

Discussion and Conclusions

The high level of completeness achieved at faint magnitudes by our survey has allowed us to probe the galaxy populations to low luminosities and obtain better understanding of the nature of the absorbing systems. We have shown that O VI absorbers previously attributed to a gaseous medium connecting massive galaxy groups are, in fact, more closely associated with less massive groups containing at least one dwarf, emission-line galaxy. In total, four of seven known O VI absorbers along the PKS 0405-  123 sightline reside in galaxy "groups" that contain at least one star-forming member. Two of the seven are found nearby to an emission-line galaxy and only one O VI absorber is found in a galaxy void. Therefore, we conclude that O VI absorbers primarily trace gas-rich environments as indicated by the presence of at least one low-mass, emission-line galaxy seen in our survey. However, the presence of O5 + ions could either be the result of starburst driven outflows or due to stripped material from galaxy interactions that also trigger star formation.

This is in stark contrast to lower ionization transitions such as Mg II that are found to reside primarily in the halos of isolated galaxies both with and without star formation [\citep=Steidel:1997]. One exception is those ultra-strong Mg II absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent width Wr(2796) > 3 Å. Three of these ultra-strong Mg II systems have been targeted for follow-up galaxy surveys and all three are found in groups containing multiple super-L* galaxies [\citep=Whiting:2006] [\citep=Nestor:2011] [\citep=Gauthier:2013], with an inferred group halo mass of [formula]. The galaxy "groups" found around O VI absorbers in our survey contain primarily low-luminosity (and presumably low-mass) galaxies [\citep=Mulchaey:2009], and are therefore not as massive as those found near ultra-strong Mg II absorbers. A detailed comparison of the dynamics between galaxies and absorbing gas may lead to further insights into the physical origin of these O VI absorbers.

In addition, our analysis reveals a clear distinction in the radial profiles of mean galaxy surface density and surface brightness around different absorbers. Specifically, O VI absorbers are found to reside in galaxy overdensities with significantly higher mean galaxy surface density and surface brightness at [formula] kpc, while only a mild increase in galaxy surface brightness is seen at small ρ around strong Lyα-only absorbers.

On the other hand, [\cite=Chen:2009] showed that both strong Lyα absorbers of log   N(H  I)  ≥  14 and O VI absorbers exhibit a comparable clustering amplitude as emission-line dominated galaxies. The apparent discrepancy between the finding of this paper and those of [\cite=Chen:2009] may be explained by the intrinsic difference in the sample definition. Our current study is based on galaxies and absorbers found in a single field, and therefore limited by the small sample size. In particular, we have defined a controlled Lyα-only sample that includes Lyα absorbers that are as weak as [formula] in order to have a sufficiently large sample for a statistical analysis. In contrast, the O VI absorbers in the comparison sample all have associated Lyα with log   N(H  I) > 14. It is therefore unclear whether the observed distinction between the galactic environments of O VI and Lyα-only absorbers represents a fundamental difference between metal and H I absorbers, or between high and low H I column density clouds. We expect that such uncertainty in the interpretation of the observations will be resolved with a larger sample of galaxy and absorber data from different fields complemented by multi-band imaging data. Together, these data will help constrain galaxy star-formation rates and reveal the presence of any faint tidal features [\citep=Chen:2009].

Lastly, an intriguing outcome of our deep galaxy survey is the discovery of an O VI absorber that is likely to reside in a "void". This O VI absorption system at [formula], which exhibits two strong components separated by 70 km  s- 1, does not have other ionic transitions detected to sensitive limits (Table 3; see also Prochaska et al. 2004). Our galaxy survey data rule out the presence of any galaxies of L > 0.04  L* at ρ < 250 kpc or the presence of any galaxies of L > 0.3  L* at ρ < 1 Mpc. The lack of additional ionic transitions associated with this absorber suggests that the gas may be hot and collisionally ionized. Also, the lack of galaxies found in the vicinity suggests that this absorber resides in an apparent void, similar to an O VI absorber at z=0.06807 for which [\cite=Tripp:2006] ruled out the presence of galaxies of L  >  0.04  L* at ρ  <  200 kpc. While a likely explanation for the origin of the gas is the warm-hot intergalactic medium, it is unclear whether the relatively narrow line width is consistent with a diffuse intergalactic origin.
