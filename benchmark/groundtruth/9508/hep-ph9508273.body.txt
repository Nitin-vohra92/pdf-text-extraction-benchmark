Abstract

The neutrino mass problem in SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R SUSY GUT obtained from the compactification of E8  ×  E8 heterotic string is analyzed. The estimated values of the neutrino masses and mixing angles can explain the experimental data on solar neutrino flux.

Recent solar neutrino experiments give an evidence for nonzero neutrino masses. The solar neutrino deficit can be explained in terms of the neutrino resonant oscillations if the neutrino mass difference is of order: [formula] or vacuum oscillations if [formula] [\cite=mikh] [\cite=pont] [\cite=blud].

It is well-known, that in SO(10) GUT small neutrino masses can be obtained via seesaw mechanism [\cite=gell]. The neutrino mass matrix for three left νe, νμ, ντ and three right νce, νcμ, νcτ neutrinos has the following form:

[formula]

In (1) M is a Dirac type 3  ×  3 mass matrix (usually it is equal to mass matrix of u, c, t, quarks), R- is the right neutrino 3  ×  3 mass matrix with entries much greater than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. After the diagonalization of (1) one obtains three heavy Majorana states (their masses practically coincide with the eigenvalues of matrix R) and three light Majorana states with the mass matrix:

[formula]

The scale of matrix R entries can be of order of the SO(10) subgroup G  =  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R breaking scale, if G is broken by the vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) of Higgs field in the [formula] representation of SO(10). For the superstring inspired models, however, G can be broken only by the v.e.v. of Higgs field in [formula] representation of SO(10). In this case the masses of right neutrinos can arise only due to the radiative corrections [\cite=witt80]. For the SUSY GUT, however, this mechanism does not work [\cite=ranpap] and the right neutrinos can obtain masses only due to the nonrenormalizable interactions which can arise in the superstring models [\cite=papran].

Our aim is consider the problem of the neutrino masses for the supersymmetric model G  =  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R, which may (or may not) be considered as a subgroup of SO(10). The particle content of the model is the following [\cite=antleo]: the sixteen fermions for each generation (including the right neutrino) belong to the representations F and [formula], where

[formula]

and the Higgs fields- to the representations: [formula] and  = (,1,2), [formula], [formula]. The vacuum expectation values (v.e.v.) of the fields H and [formula] are connected with the breaking of the group G and the v.e.v. of the field h -with the breaking of the group Gew = SU(2)L  ×  U(1)Y . In addition, there is a set of the G singlet scalar fields φm (m=1,2...). For the supersymmetric models, derived from the E8  ×  E8 heterotic string compactification over Calabi-Yau manifolds with SU(3) holonomy, the maximal gauge group in the four dimension is E8  ×  E6 (by embedding the spin connection of the manifold in the gauge group, E8  ×  E8 can be broken to E8  ×  E6 ) and chiral superfields belong to the [formula] representations of E6 [\cite=witt85].In this case, the minimal set would consist of ng + 1 SO(10) (or G) singlets, where ng is the number of fermion generations. One of the singlets develops the v.e.v. at the electroweak scale and generates the masses of the singlet fields [\cite=antleo].

Then most general superpotential for the supersymmetric G  =  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R model has the form [\cite=papran] [\cite=antleo] :

[formula]

The 9  ×  9 mass matrix of the three left, three right neutrinos and three singlets has the following form

[formula]

where MG is 3  ×  3 matrix of right neutrino-singlets mixing, Mφ is 3  ×  3 mass matrix of singlets. As a result one obtains that (in the case of absence of mixing) the light neutrino masses are proportional to m2qmφ / m2G, where m2q for q = u,c,t are the masses of u, c, t -quarks, mφ is the typical singlet mass ~  MW (electroweak breaking scale), mG is of order of G breaking scale ~  1016GeV [\cite=papran] . This gives the ultralight neutrino masses: mν1  ~  10- 16eV, mν2  ~  10- 12eV, mν3  ~  10- 8eV. The similar problems exist in SU(5) -flipped model. The various possibilities to obtain more acceptable neutrino masses are considered in [\cite=ranpap] [\cite=papran] [\cite=leonver]. Here we want to consider the problem of the neutrino masses for the superstring derived models proposed by Witten [\cite=witt86]. Witten [\cite=witt86] has shown that it is possible to construct stable, irreducible and holomorphic SU(4) or SU(5) vector bundles over Calabi-Yau manifolds. This means that one can obtain an SO(10) or SU(5) supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimension by the embedding the structure group of the bundle in E8. For the SU(4) vector bundle, when the maximal gauge group in the four dimension is SO(10), the content of the chiral superfields is the following [\cite=witt86] [\cite=mur] [\cite=asmur] [\cite=asion]:

[formula]

where ng is the number of generations (ng=3), δ, ε, η are the integer numbers δ,ε,η  ≥  1. As for ordinary case of tangent bundle with the E6 as a maximal gauge group, in this case also it is possible to obtain models with the gauge symmetries which are subgroups of SO(10) via Hosotani mechanism [\cite=witt86] [\cite=asmur] [\cite=hos]. Let us consider the neutrino mass problem in such a model with gauge symmetry G  =  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R. For the simplest case ε  =  δ = 1 and η = 2 one has only two SO(10) singlets. One of these singlets developed the v.e.v. of order of electroweak symmetry breaking scale. The second singlet is mixed with the neutrinos. The 7  ×  7 mass matrix for three left, three right neutrinos and this singlet has the following form:

[formula]

where ML, MD , R are 3  ×  3 matrices, V-is a three dimensional column. The elements of the left neutrino mass matrix ML can arise due to the nonrenormalizable interactions which are allowed in the string models [\cite=akhm] : where M is the typical scale connected with nonrenormalizable interactions, it must be of order of Plank scale or string unification scale, λ -some constant. Then the matrix elements of ML are of order [formula]. The 3x3 matrix R also arises due to the nonrenormalizable interactions [\cite=ranpap] [\cite=papran]: The matrix elements of R are of order [formula]. The 3x3 neutrino Dirac mass matrix MD (which we assume to be equal to the up quark mass matrix), Vi (i=1,2,3)- the mixing between singlet and right neutrinos and the mass mφ of the singlet arise from the usual interaction terms (3).

To obtain the estimates for the neutrino masses one must determine G breaking scale mG. We will consider two cases: the symmetry G  =  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R with and without the left-right discrete symmetry. The renormalization group equations for one loop gives the following solutions for the coupling constants α1,α2,α3 [\cite=asmur]:

[formula]

where MS is the supersymmetry breaking scale (we assume that it is between 100GeV and 10000GeV), the values of bi,b-is,is (i=1,2,3) are given in [\cite=asmur]. The more precise results can be obtained in two loop approximation. The renormalization group equations analysis in two loop approximation gives the following results for mG

[formula]

for the case of the presence of the discrete left-right symmetry and

[formula]

for the case of absence of such a symmetry. The results of (8) and (9) are obtained for the initial values of the electroweak coupling constants

[formula]

Let as consider now the mass matrix (6). After the diagonalization of the matrix (6) we obtain 7 Majorana neutrinos (three of which are light). One can estimate the light neutrino mass values without specifying the exact form of matrix (6). The only assumption we made, is the following: all the matrix elements of the matrix ML are of the same order of magnitude [formula]. The same statement must be valid for the 3  ×  3 matrix R and three dimensional column V separately: the elements of R are of order [formula] and the elements of V are of order of mG. Then, it is easy to estimate the value of the determinant of the matrix (6) and the sums of its diagonal minors of 6x6, 5x5, 4x4 order:

[formula]

Two eigenvalues of the matrix (6) are of order mR and the other two- of order mG. One can obtain a simple formulae for the masses of three light neutrinos for the case mν3  ≫  mν2  ≫  mν1 :

[formula]

In (11), (12) rc,rt -are the factors connected with the quark mass renormalization from the unification scale to ordinary energies. These factors depend on the ratio of vacuum expectation values of scalar doublets connected with the electroweak symmetry breaking (tgθ) and the t-quark mass. For the t-quark mass mt = (175  ±  15)GeV and 0.1 < tgθ < 10 one obtains:

[formula]

In (13) the larger smaller of rc,rt correspond to the larger values of mt .

What about the mixing angles? To obtain the estimates for the mixing angles between the left νe,νμ,ντ neutrinos one has to specify the form of Dirac -type mass matrix MD . Let us consider the case when the mass matrix of u, c, t- quarks (which we consider to be equal to MD) has a form, proposed by Fritzsch [\cite=fri]:

[formula]

where [formula]. We must made some assumptions for the matrix R and ML also: let us consider the case when they have a diagonal form:

[formula]

It is possible to estimate the mixing angles for three light neutrino states ν1,ν2,ν3 by solving the equation for eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix M for the case mν3  ≫  mν1,mν2. Using the following formulae for the light neutrino masses:

[formula]

and calculating the determinant of matrix M and sums of its main minors of 6, 5, and 4 order

[formula]

(where M1,M2,M3 are the elements in M connected with the mixing of right neutrinos and singlet: VT  =  (M1,M2,M3)) one can obtain the estimates for the light neutrino masses. In (17) we omit the terms not relevant for our consideration. We will consider two alternatives for the ν1,ν2:

[formula]

The conditions (18), (19) are equivalent to the conditions

[formula]

For the first case (18), (20) one obtains the same formulae for neutrino masses as previously

[formula]

where we assume that R  ~  R1  ~  R2  ~  R3 and m1  ~  m2  ~  m3. The three eigenstates νi, i=1,2,3 of matrix (6) with three lightest masses one can express via weak eigenstates να, α = e,μ,τ by means of unitary transformation: νi  =  aiανα, where aiα is the unitary matrix. For the mixing angles between νe and νμ (θ) and νe and ντ (θ') one obtains:

[formula]

Taking into account the results (8), (9) for the G symmetry breaking scale one obtains the following estimates for the three light neutrino masses:

[formula]

for case of the presence of discrete left-right (case (a)) symmetry and

[formula]

for the case of the absence of left-right discrete symmetry (case (b)). In (24), (25) [formula] is the Plank mass. Of course, all the estimates (24), (25) are correct with accuracy of order of magnitude.

To explain the solar neutrino deficit via resonant oscillations the neutrino mass difference and mixing angles must be of order

[formula]

Then for the case (a) it is possible to obtain such a mass difference between third and second and first neutrinos if the fraction [formula] is of order ~  (1  -  0.01) which is reasonable value [\cite=asmur]. The problem arises with mixing angle: the formula (23) gives small value for sin 22θ  ~  10- 4.

For the case (b) such a mass difference it is possible to obtain between the second and the first neutrinos if the fraction [formula] is order of unity. In this case the condition (20) is valid. The mixing angle is of order sin 2θ  ~  1.3  ·  10- 2 which is a reasonable value. Thus, in this case obtained values for the mixing angles and neutrino mass difference allow one to explain the solar neutrino deficit via resonant oscillations in the sun.

To explain the solar neutrino deficit via longwave vacuum oscillations the neutrino mass difference and the mixing angles must be of order

[formula]

It is clear that it is impossible for the considering case as our mixing angles are too small.

Let as proceed to the case (19), (21). For the case (a) the condition (21) gives for M:

[formula]

For such a values of M the light neutrino masses are of order

[formula]

It is clear that the mass difference of second and first family is too small. The mass difference between third and first family can achieve acceptable value but the mixing angle as in previous case will be small sin 22θ  ~    ·  10- 4. Let us consider the case (b). From (21) one obtains for M

[formula]

For such a values of M the light neutrino masses are of order

[formula]

The value (0.5 - 1.1)10- 5eV which is necessary to explain the solar neutrino deficit via longwave vacuum oscillations is achieved for the mass difference of first two neutrinos for the following values of M:

[formula]

What about the mixing angles for the considering case? As the masses of two lightest neutrinos are close to each other, the mixing angle between them can be relatively large.

The angle relevant for the neutrino oscillations is given by (if we neglect the mixing with third light neutrino):

[formula]

where

[formula]

To explain the solar neutrino deficit via vacuum longwave oscillations tan θ must satisfy the condition

[formula]

(as it follows from (27)). This gives :

[formula]

or, with the same accuracy:

[formula]

Thus, it is possible to obtain large (35) mixing angles in this case if the condition (36) takes place. This means that the masses of first two light neutrinos must be very close to each other: the difference of masses must be ~   100 times smaller than the masses.

Thus, our analyze shows that it is possible to explain the solar neutrino deficit for the considering theory for the case of a unification group G  =  SU(4)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  SU(2)R without the left-right discrete symmetry can be explained in two ways. 1)Via resonant oscillations in the sun if the value of which is characteristic scale of nonrenormalizable interactions is of order of Plank mass MPl = 1.2  ·  1019GeV. Generally speaking, it is more natural, that such a interactions arises in string scale [formula] [\cite=wain] [\cite=kapl] however the difference of ~  7 can be explained by means of coupling constants λ, λ' in nonrenormalizable terms: The mixing angle in this case ~  0.06 which is the value we need. 2)Via longwave vacuum oscillations: in this case the masses of two light neutrinos are very close to each other and the mixing angle is large as needed.
