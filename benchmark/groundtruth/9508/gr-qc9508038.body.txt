On the quantum stability of the time machine

Introduction

Since the wormhole-based time machine was proposed [\cite=Tho] much efforts have been directed towards finding a mechanism that could "protect causality" and destroy such a time machine. One of the most popular ideas is that the creation of the time machine might be prevented by quantum effects since as it is claimed in [\cite=KimT] "at any event in spacetime, which can be joined to itself by a closed null geodesic, the vacuum fluctuations of a massless scalar field should produce a divergent renormalized stress-energy tensor". The considerations leading to such a claim I shall call hereafter "FKT approach".

In essence, the FKT approach amounts to the following [\cite=Fro] [\cite=KimT] (see also [\cite=Kli]). The vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor 〈Tμν〉 of the field φ in the (multiply connected) spacetime M containing a time machine is found by applying some differential operator Dμν to the Hadamard function

[formula]

To find G(1) it is proposed to use the formula

[formula]

Here [formula] is the Hadamard function of φ in the spacetime [formula], which is the universal covering space for M, and [formula] is the n-th inverse image of X∈M (γ0X is identified in ([\ref=Cov]) with X). The advantage of the use of ([\ref=Cov]) is that [formula] is supposed to have the Hadamard form:

[formula]

where σ is half the square of the geodesic distance between X and X', and ũ, ṽ are some smooth functions. We might think thus that

[formula]

Here [formula] and the subscript "ren" (renormalized) has appeared because renormalization of [formula] and of [formula] requires substraction of the same terms. The last series in ([\ref=Tren]) diverges (since [formula], when X approaches the horizon), so the conclusion is made that the appearance of a closed timelike curve must be prevented (unless some effects of quantum gravity remedy the situation) by the infinite increase of the energy density.

The goal of this paper is to state that there is actually no reasons to expect that the energy density diverges at the Cauchy horizon in the general case. In particular, we cite a few examples in which the stress-energy tensor of the massless scalar field (as found in the usual way -- through quantization directly in M) remains bounded as the horizon is approached. These examples are not of course anywhere near an adequate model of the time machine (for example, the wave equation on the two-dimensional cylinder has no solutions, except for constant, continuous at the Cauchy horizon). However, they can well serve as counterexamples to statements like that cited above. So it seems important to find out whether they indicate only some loop-holes in the FKT approach, which can then be used in the general case, or whether this approach must be fully revised. Our analysis in Section 2 shows that the latter is true -- by several independent reasons one cannot extract any information from expression ([\ref=Tren]). In Section 3 some special cases are considered necessary to support statements from Section 2.

Analysis

Going to the universal covering

Formula ([\ref=Cov]), combined with some implicit assumptions serves as a basis for the overall FKT approach since one cannot use ([\ref=Had]) in multiply connected spacetimes, where σ is not defined. To discuss its validity and to reveal these assumptions let us first state the simple fact that most properties of the Hadamard function, including the validity of ([\ref=Had]), depends on the choice of the vacuum appearing in definition ([\ref=DefG]). So, formulas like ([\ref=Cov]) are meaningless until we specify the vacuua |0〉 and |〉 in M and [formula] respectively. We come thus to the problem of great importance in our consideration -- how, given |0〉, one could determine corresponding |〉? The above-mentioned assumptions concern just this problem. They must be something like the following:

For any vacuum on M there exists a vacuum |〉 on [formula] such that ([\ref=Cov]) holds.

The function [formula] corresponding to |〉 has the "Hadamard form" ([\ref=Had]).

G(1) determines [formula] uniquely.

The validity of Assumption 1 is almost obvious in the simplest cases (see below), but it was not proven in the general case. (One can meet the references to [\cite=Ban] in this connection. Note, however, that the functions KC which stand there in the analog of our formula ([\ref=Cov]), are actually not defined in our case, i. e. when |Γ| =   ∞  .)

Assumption 2 seems still more arbitrary. The validity of ([\ref=Had]) was proven not for any state, but only for some specific class of states (see [\cite=Ful]) and there is no reason to believe that our [formula] belongs just to this class.

Assumption 3 is definitely untrue. In the following section we construct as an example a class of vacuua [formula] such that ([\ref=Cov]) is satisfied for any f while [formula] differ for different f. This nonuniqueness is far from harmless. As we argue below it makes, in fact, expression ([\ref=Tren]) meaningless.

The expression for the stress-energy tensor

Expression ([\ref=Tren]) is the main result of the FKT approach and ([\ref=Cov]) is needed only to justify it. So let us state first that

([\ref=Tren]) does not follow (or, at least, does not follow immediately) from ([\ref=Cov]), since

To write [formula] without a special proof one must be sure that the series [formula] and [formula] converge uniformly, while it is clear that they do not (at least as long as ([\ref=Had]) holds). This nonuniformity manifests itself, in particular, in the fact that, in general, one cannot drop the nonsingular terms in [formula]. In Subsection 3.2 we shall show that the last series in ([\ref=Tren]) can diverge off the Cauchy horizon though ([\ref=Had],[\ref=Cov]) hold and G(1)ren (and [formula]) are smooth there.

Even when |〉 belongs to the above-mentioned class, ([\ref=Had]) is proven not for any [formula], but only for [formula] lying in the "sufficiently small" neighborhood of X. It is necessary, in particular, that [formula] would be defined uniquely. To provide this in Ref. [\cite=Ful], for example, X and [formula] are required not to lie respectively near points , connected by a null geodesic with a point conjugate to [formula] before [formula]. To violate this condition for the points X' and γX' it suffices to separate the mouths of the wormhole widely enough and to fill the space between them with the conventional matter [\cite=HawEl].

Like the Hadamard function, [formula] depends on which vacuum we choose, while from the FKT standpoint all vacuua [formula] satisfying ([\ref=Cov]) are equivalent. This equivalence is of a fundamental nature -- the only physical object is the spacetime M, while [formula] and [formula] are some auxiliary matters and as long as ([\ref=Cov]) holds we cannot apply any extraneous criteria to distinguish among them. So, we have no way of determining what to substitute in ([\ref=Tren]) as [formula]. In Subsection 3.2 we shall see that choosing different [formula] (even when [formula] is a part of the Minkowski plane) one can make [formula] finite or infinite at the horizon at will.

Let me note in passing that there is no point in using ([\ref=Tren]) unless we decide that [formula] is among the very "good" and convenient vacuua. For an arbitrary [formula], it is not a bit easier to find [formula] than [formula].

Interpretation

Suppose that [formula] for some |Ψ〉 does diverge at the Cauchy horizon. Suppose further that it is [formula] that stands in the right side of the Einstein equations (though it is not obvious, see [\cite=Bir] for the literature and discussion). Does this really mean that owing to the quantum effects the time machine M cannot be created? I think that the answer is negative. It well may be that [formula] does not diverge for some other state |Φ〉 (example see in Subsection 3.3). Why must we restrict ourselves to the state |Ψ〉? To prove that the Einstein equations and QFT are incompatible in M one must have proven that the expected stress-energy tensor tends to infinity for any quantum state, or at least for any state satisfying some reasonable physical conditions (say, stability).

Examples

Let us find the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in a few specific cases. We restrict our consideration to the two-dimensional cylinder M obtained from the plane (τ,χ) by identifying [formula] and endowed with the metric

[formula]

Here [formula]; C is a smooth function on M. To find in the ordinary way [formula] for the free real scalar field φ

[formula]

we must first of all specify the vacuum we consider. That is we must choose a linear space of solutions of ([\ref=Weq]) and an "orthonormal" basis [\cite=Bir] U = {un} in it. In particular, this will define the Hadamard function:

[formula]

A possible choice of U for the non-twisted field is

[formula]

The vacuum |0〉C defined by ([\ref=ConVac]) (the "conformal" vacuum) is especially attractive as the expressions for the Hadamard function G(1)C and for the stress-energy tensor [formula] are already obtained (see [\cite=Bir]):

[formula]

Here ε =  - 1 / 2 or 1 depending on whether φ is twisted or untwisted and R is the curvature of M. Though the absence of a solution corresponding to n = 0 in ([\ref=ConVac]) may seem artificial, it is, in fact, an inherent feature of |0〉C, which is to describe the vacuum of φ as a massless limit of the "natural" vacuum of a massive field (cf [\cite=Bir]). One could start, however, from another vacuum for the massive field and arrive at another theory (see below) with the basis [formula]

[formula]

Where the real constant F is a free parameter. Choosing different [formula] we obtain different vacuua |0〉F and Hadamard functions G(1)F. It is easy to see that

[formula]

Two-dimensional time machines in the conformal vacuum state

As a first example let us consider the Misner spacetime, which is the quadrant α < 0, β > 0 of the Minkowski plane ds2 = dαdβ with points identified by the rule (α0,β0)  ↦  (Aα0,β0 / A). The coordinate transformation

[formula]

delivers the isometry between Misner space and M with

[formula]

W here is an arbitrary parameter with dimension of mass. Substituting this in ([\ref=Tcon]) we immediately find

[formula]

The metric in coordinates α,β is "good" (smooth, nondegenerate) near the Cauchy horizons α = 0 or β = 0. So, the proper basis of an observer approaching to one of them with a finite acceleration is related to the basis [formula] by a finite Lorentz transformation. Thus the quantities we are to examine are, in fact, the components of [formula] in the basis D, which are

[formula]

Now let us use the above simple method to find [formula] for two time machines more (see also [\cite=Yur]). Consider first the cylinder S obtained from the strip

[formula]

by gluing points η  =  η0, ξ = 1 with the points η = Aη0, ξ = A. This spacetime was considered in detail in [\cite=Fro] where it was called the "standard model". A simple investigation shows that the Cauchy horizons α = 0 and β = 0 divide S into three regions. Causality holds in the "inner" region [formula] and violates in [formula]. Introducing new coordinates u,  v:

[formula]

we find that [formula] like the Misner space is isometric to M. This time

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

Consider lastly the spacetime obtained by changing ξ- 2  →  η- 2 in ([\ref=StMod]). This spacetime is similar to the standard model, but has a somewhat more curios causal structure -- there are two causally nonconnected regions separated by the time machine. [formula] differs from that in ([\ref=TFro]) by the off-diagonal (bounded) terms

[formula]

So, we see that in all three cases the vacuum energy density (associated with some vacuum states) does grow infinitely as one approaches to the Cauchy horizon. A few comments are necessary, however:

The divergence in discussion is not at all something peculiar to the time machine: the passage to the limit A  →    ∞   shows that precisely the same divergence (with T =  - 1 / (48π)) takes place in [formula] though (in the case of Misner space) [formula] is merely a part of the Minkowski plane. This suggests that for the time machine too, the divergence of the stress-energy tensor is a consequence not of its causal or topological structure but rather of the unfortunate choice of the quantum state.

The twisted field at [formula] has the bounded [formula] (cf. [\cite=Sush]).

Let us consider nonvacuum states now (see Subsection 2.3). The first example is a two-particle state |1n1- n〉 with the particles corresponding to the n-th and - n-th modes of ([\ref=ConVac]). [formula] is readily found using [\cite=Bir]:

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula]. Thus we see that there are states with the bounded energy density of the untwisted field.

Another yet example is the equilibrium state at a nonzero temperature |t〉. Expression (4.27) of [\cite=Bir] gives

[formula]

So, for any H there exists such temperature t that 〈t|Tγγ|t〉ren does not diverge at the horizon.

Another vacuum

The conformal vanuum is not suited for verifying or exemplifying most of statements made in Section 2., since the Hadamard function does not exist in this state. So consider now the new vacuum |0〉f on the plane (τ,χ) defined by the modes

[formula]

where [formula], δ is an arbitrary positive constant: δ < 1 and f is an arbitrary smooth positive function: [formula]. The modes ([\ref=AnVac]) are obtained >from that defining the conformal vacuum on the plane by a Bogolubov transformation of the low-frequency modes so as to avoid the infrared divergence without affecting the ultraviolet behavior of [formula]. The asymptotic form of [formula] does not depend on f:

[formula]

If we retain only the first term, we obtain (in the flat case)

[formula]

So, the last series in ([\ref=Tren]) diverges not only at the horizon, but everywhere on M (cf. Subsection 2.2).

[formula] can be found from ([\ref=GF]) (see [\cite=Bir]). For any C we have:

[formula]

Having taken an appropriate f(ω) one can make 〈Tαα〉renf infinite or zero at the horizon, as we have stated in Subsection 2.2.

To illustrate some more statements from Section 2. let us first find GΣ. To this end note that it has the form

[formula]

with

[formula]

The function h(p) can be written as a sum: h = (h - h0) + h0, where

[formula]

The first summand is a smooth function falling off at infinity like p- 2 and the second summand (h0) is a holomorphic (but for p =   ±  i) function admitting the following estimate:

[formula]

Hence [\cite=Fed] we can apply the Poisson formula to ([\ref=GSum]) and obtain:

[formula]

We see thus that GΣ is indeed the Hadamard function and it corresponds to the vacuum |0〉F with F = f(0).

Remark 1. This does not mean, however, that GΣ will be a Hadamard function of some reasonable state for any [formula]. One can easily construct, for example, such a vacuum that [formula] will not be invariant under translations  χ,χ'  ↦  χ + H,χ' + H and GΣ(χ,χ'), as a consequence, will not even be symmetric.

Remark 2. For all G(1)f with the same f(0) the Hadamard functions GΣ are the same. This proves our statement from Subsection 2.1.

To find [formula] note that it differs from [formula] only by the term arising from the second summand in ([\ref=GF]) (cf. [\cite=Bir]):

[formula]

That is

[formula]

So, for all three time machines considered here there exists a vacuum, such that the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is bounded in the causal region.

Conclusion

Thus, we have seen that one cannot obtain any information about the energy density near the Cauchy horizon employing the FKT approach. In the absence of any other general approach this means that all we have is a few simple examples. In some of them the energy density diverges there and in some do not. So, the time machine perhaps is stable and perhaps is not. This seems to be the most strong assertion we can make.
