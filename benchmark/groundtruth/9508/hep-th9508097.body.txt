Abstract

Owing to its lack of derivability, the dissipative anomaly operator appearing in the theory of turbulence without pressure recently proposed by Polyakov appears to be quite elusive. In particular, we give arguments that seem to lead to the conclusion that an anomaly in the first equation of the sequence of conservation laws cannot be a priori excluded.

In a recent paper [\cite=1] (see also [\cite=2]) Polyakov has put forward a method to treat turbulence with exact field theoretical methods, in the case when the effect of pressure is negligible. The work has been inspired in a paper by Chekhlov and Yakhot [\cite=3], where new results concerning Burgers' turbulence have been given. The starting point for this one-dimensional case is Burgers equation

[formula]

where κ is a function that defines the spatial correlation of the random forces. For the generating functional

[formula]

one obtains

[formula]

and further [\cite=1]

[formula]

where D is the dissipation term

[formula]

If the viscosity ν were zero one would have a closed differential equation for Z. To reach the inertial range one must, however, keep ν infinitesimal but non-zero. The anomaly mechanism mentioned above implies that infinitesimal viscosity produces a finite effect, whose computation is one of the main objectives in [\cite=1]. In a first stage, the inviscid equations (5) have been considered (ν = 0). Then, modulo the stirring force and the viscosity, one has the following sequence of conservation laws for Eq. (1)

[formula]

the sign ≈   meaning precisely that the viscosity and the stirring force terms are dropped out [\cite=1].

As discussed by Polyakov in detail, Eq. (5) can be interpreted as a relation for the generating functionals [formula], involving both the stirring force and the viscosity. The latter presents a problem. The rule is that in any equation involving space points separated by a distance larger than a, the viscosity can be put equal to zero.

And here comes the specific situation we want to deal with. In principle, it seems legitimated to use the inviscid limit for the first equation, n = 1, of ([\ref=13p]), because in this case one can make use of the steady state condition

[formula]

The problems seems to start with the case n = 2, because then one has to take a time derivative of the product of two (or more) u's at the same point. This problem has been solved, in the case n = 2, by making the replacement

[formula]

and by leting y  →  0 only after the viscosity is taken to zero. Using then the inviscid equations for n = 1 one can write

[formula]

By employing simple algebraic identities, and the following expression

[formula]

one gets

[formula]

where a0(x) is a dissipative anomaly operator, given by [\cite=1]

[formula]

It is here crucial to observe that the anomaly would be zero if u(x) were differentiable. However, as remarked in [\cite=1], the steady state condition clearly prevents this from being true. Indeed, one of the consequences of Eq. (5) is that in the steady-state situation one has

[formula]

and the celebrated Kolmogorov relation holds

[formula]

The value of the anomaly defines the limiting contribution of the viscous term in the steady state

[formula]

Notice, again, that the fact that the anomaly a0(x) is non vanishing (together with its important consequences, as the Kolmogorov relation) depends solely on the non-differentiability of the function u(x). Simple considerations --the first of which could be pure symmetry-- can lead us easily to the conclusion that an anomaly of the same type can be also present in the first of the equations. In fact, its absence has not been proven in [\cite=1], but just the compatibility of the general argument with the fact that it can be zero (the whole argument has been qualified by Polyakov himself as a consistent conjecture [\cite=1]).

Crude symmetry considerations would yield

[formula]

where, again the non-differentiability of the function u(x) permits the anomaly term (the second one on the rhs) to be non-zero. It is easy to see that if one exactly parallels the derivation leading to the presence of a0, this term does not appear [\cite=5]. However, the main argument that leads to the possibility of an anomaly in the first equation is actually of the same kind, namely that owing to the non-differentiability of u(x), pretended identities as the last step in Eq. ([\ref=ex1]) might acquire an additional contribution. One should observe that by using the Burgers equation any discontinuity in the time derivative of u and its powers can be traced back to a corresponding discontinuity in the spatial derivative. But then, point-splitting the x - derivative of u2(x) (what is not trivial matter, given the non-differentiability of u(x)), in the form

[formula]

and using the same kind of manipulations as in [\cite=1], we are led to the possible presence of an anomaly which is not exactly given by the immediate guess ([\ref=n1]) but by a very similar expression:

[formula]

Using the same labeling of Polyakov, we will call it a- 1(x),

[formula]

It is seen to be non-vanishing in general. This is realized by direct calculation of the derivative as a quotient of differences and by considering several possible ways of taking the two limits involved, namely the one of the derivative itself and the limit y  →  0. Notice that this non-vanishing is, naively, even more strong than in the cases n = 2 and further, because differentiability would here yield an infintesimum of first order only, while in the case n = k it would be of the corresponding order k.

It seems difficult to give an immediate physical meaning to this possible anomaly. In the case of the anomalies [formula], Polyakov has produced a beautiful interpretation, as limiting contributions of the viscous term in the steady-state situation [formula]:

[formula]

and similarly for the others. As observed by Falkovich [\cite=4], due to the fact that [formula] is an integral of motion of the complete Burgers equation, we do not get a steady-state condition for the case n = 1. This means in some way that the corresponding equality for a- 1,

[formula]

should be a universal one but, on the other hand, 〈a- 1(x)〉 = 0. This trivial situation obviously ceases to be so if one allows the viscosity ν not to be strictly constant.

As is plain, such possibility would bear with it important consequences, as a corresponding Kolmogorov relation (with power 2 instead of power 3), and it would even modify the Kolmogorov relation itself and all the subsequent anomalies (starting from a0(x)), since it would contribute a term in the derivation of the relations for u2 and all the subsequent un. To finish, let us stress again that the existence of a- 1 and of all these additional terms is, in principle, just a possibility, brought about in a natural way by the same mathematical argument that leads to the introduction of the anomalies an, n  ≥  0, consistently.
