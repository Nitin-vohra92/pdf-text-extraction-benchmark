Introduction

Physics of quark-gluon plasma is one of the most important problems in high energy physics. Quark-gluon plasma state is expected to be produced in extremely high temperature, which will be realized in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. To obtain the higher temperature, experimental setting has been growing in three directions: the higher incident energy par nucleon, the heavier incident nucleus, and the heavier target nucleus. In any case, colliding energy is getting larger, but the larger energy does not directly mean the higher temperature. It is not obvious, whether large fraction of colliding energy will be transferred into thermal energy (temperature) or kinetic energy (systematic flow). Especially, the heavier target does not correspond to the larger colliding velocity in the center of mass system. Hence, if we stand on the Landau-type "simple stopping" picture, achieved energy density must become lower for larger target mass. In this paper, we will analyze the recent experimental data for various target nuclei and discuss systematic change of initial parameters in hydrodynamical model.

In a previous paper[\cite=mmn] we formulated a semi-phenomenological quantum transport theory for a quark-gluon plasma fluid based on an operator valued Langevin equation. Putting a mode spectrum and a damping into this formula, we can easily evaluate thermodynamical quantities and transport coefficients. Introducing a simple model spectrum to this formula, we have already discussed the space-time evolution of (1+1)-dimensional viscous quark-gluon plasma fluid [\cite=date] and (3+1)-dimensional perfect fluid quark-gluon plasma with phase-transition [\cite=akase]. We have also discussed the case of baryon-rich quark-gluon plasma with phase-transition [\cite=ishii], in which one of the conclusions was that the baryon-number effect was not so much large. Hence, although the existing experiments do not seem to be baryon-free, we apply a simple baryon-free quark-gluon plasma model to analyses of available experiments.

Hydrodynamical model with phase-transition

Following [\cite=date], we here introduce a simple model mode spectrum,

[formula]

where A is a parameter that adjusts the degrees of modes and TC is the critical temperature responsible for the reliant phase transition. Supposing that the high temperature phase is dominated by massless u-, d- , s-quarks and gluons and the hadronic phase is dominated by pions and kaons, we can put A  =  1.89, M = 200 MeV, d = 2 MeV, and TC = 160 MeV. With these parameters, we can easily obtain an equation of state with phase transition-like behavior (fig.1), which seems to reproduce the Lattice QCD result [\cite=akase].

The hydrodynamical equation is given by,

[formula]

for perfect fluid. Here E,P and Uμ are, respectively, energy density, pressure and local four velocity. For cylindrically symmetric expansion along the collision axis, it is convenient to introduce new variables, τ, η, r and φ defined by

[formula]

instead of ordinary coordinate t, x, y and z. As for the local four velocity, we represent it by four components, Uτ, Uη,  Ur and Uφ associated with the new variables,

[formula]

Because of UμUμ = 1 and the cylindrical symmetry, the four components can be reduced to two variables YT and YL[\cite=akase],

[formula]

Taking account of the formation time, let us put the temperature distribution on η and r at τ  =  τ0,

[formula]

assuming that the hydrodynamical expansion starts at τ  =  τ0  =  1 fm later than the collision instance at τ = 0 fm. T0 represents the initial temperature, η0 and r0 are measures of the longitudinal and transverse spreads in η and r, respectively. T0, η0, r0,ση and σr are input parameters to characterize our model on which we should impose a constraint given by a fixed value of the initial fluid energy Eini  =  χEtot (Etot standing for the total collision energy and χ for the inelasticity). As for the initial condition of the local velocity, we use Bjorken's scaling solution, YL  =  η, in the longitudinal direction, by which we can take the initial longitudinal flow into account. Initial values of these parameters should be determined on the basis of an appropriate physical discussion, but details of these parameters are deeply connected to the interaction mechanism and the thermalization process. In this paper, standing on phenomenological point of view, we try to choose these parameters so as to reproduce experimental results of both momentum spectrums.

Particle Distributions

The numerical solution of the hydrodynamical equation gives us the momentum distribution of hadrons, coming out from a local system with volume dσμ in local equilibrium with freeze-out temperature Tf, through the formula

[formula]

where [formula] with hadron mass m (see ref.[\cite=akase]). Integrating eq.([\ref=5.3]) on the hypersurface with Tf, we obtain

[formula]

for the Y-distribution,

[formula]

for η'-distribution, where [formula] stands for the pseudorapidity distribution, and

[formula]

for the PT-distribution.

Our numerical results given by eq.([\ref=5.5]) is shown in fig.2. As is well known, the freeze-out temperature Tf is directly connected with the PT slope and we should determine it from the experimental PT-spectrum. However, throughout this paper, we fix it equal to Tf = 140MeV because of the lack of sufficient experimental data.

Our numerical solution of hydrodynamical model is so designed as to describe the head-on collision of the same kind of nuclei in the center of mass system. In order to apply the solution to the asymmetric collision, such as WA80 and NA35, we estimated effective participants in large target nucleus as,

[formula]

Atar and Aproj being target mass and projectile mass, respectively.

Numerical results

Our hydrodynamical model contains many parameters to be adjusted. We have already fixed freeze-out temperature as Tf = 140MeV from fig.2 in the previous section. We may put formation time equal to τ0  =  1 fm and initial transverse size equal to the size of smaller nucleus,

[formula]

where σr  =  1. As for the local velocity, we use Bjorken's scaling solution, YL  =  η, neglecting initial transverse flow. Therefore, the residual parameters to be adjusted are only initial temperature T0 at central point , and longitudinal size at initial time, η0 and ση. We try to adjust these parameters so as to reproduce existing experiments. Our results for sulphur beam experiments are shown in fig.3, and the values of parameters for sulphur and for oxygen beam are summarized in table 1. In any case, our model seems to reproduce the experimental results well with plausible values of the parameters. Table 2 stands for the results given by a equation of state in the limit TC  →    ∞  , which corresponds to a hot hadron-gas model. In this case, χ became an unphysical value, larger than unity. It means that we failed to reproduce experimental results with the hot hadron-gas model.

These results tell us that larger nuclei are more effective to make a high temperature fluid than smaller nuclei can do even in target experiment. For larger targets, the initial temperature must become higher, the longitudinal size smaller, and the inelasticity larger. This kind of tendency is just desired for the experimental quark-gluon plasma production.

Sometimes, it has been pointed out that the present CERN energy is not high enough to make the Bjorken's scaling quark-gluon plasma, and the stopping picture of Landau type is then realized. However, the simple stopping picture is not in agreement with our results. In the simple stopping picture, the only collision parameter is the colliding relative velocity γ, and the longitudinal size contracts with 1 / γ and the energy density increases with γ2. In target experiments, the larger target mass means the higher collision energy, but does not means the higher collision velocity. Table 3 shows the our results and relative velocities. The tendency is opposite to the simple Landau picture. Of course, it only means the failure of the simple stopping picture and we may describe the phenomena which require to introduce additional phenomenological parameters, such as energy dependent inelasticity [\cite=weiner].

In this paper, we have fitted hydrodynamical parameters in a purely phenomenological manner without resorting to any dynamical model for initial collision process. Although we need a dynamical model for the quark-gluon plasma formation to understand the results in the table 1, we may extrapolate our phenomenological results in order to obtain the rough sketch of coming experiments. Figure 4 indicates us that parameters in Pb + Pb 150 GeV/A collision are T0  =  250MeV and η0  +  ση  =  0.8. The possible psuedorapidity-distribution of hadrons is shown in fig. 5 and the total charged hadronic multiplicity (pions and kaons) reaches 2095.

Concluding Remarks

We have applied our (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamical model with phase-transition to the recent heavy-ion experiments. Our results show that the inelasticity increases with target mass, the longitudinal size is getting smaller with target mass, and the initial temperature becomes higher. Such a tendency is very promising for our aim of producing quark-gluon plasma experimentally and also for understanding the future experimental results at CERN and RHIC.
