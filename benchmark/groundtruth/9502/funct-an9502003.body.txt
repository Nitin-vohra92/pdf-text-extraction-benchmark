Uniqueness theorem for unbounded domain

Introduction

Let D be a simply connected unbounded domain in [formula] lying inside a band of minimal width defined by conditions 0  ≤  y2  ≤  h, [formula], ρ > 0, y = (y1,y2). We assume that [formula], where γi are smooth curves given by formulas y2 = fi(y1), i = 1,2 with

[formula]

Let Aρ(D) be a space of harmonic functions in D which are continuous with their partial derivatives of the first order up to the ending points of ∂D and satisfying the following condition:

[formula]

The purpose of this paper is to prove the following

Theorem. If function U∈Aρ(D) satisfies the two following conditions

[formula]

[formula]

(where [formula] is the exterior normal vector for the boundary ∂D) then [formula] in D.

In the case when the condition ([\ref=2]) is changed by [formula] with c1  =  Const, y∈∂D, and k being an non-negative integer this theorem has been proved by Z. R. Ashurova in [\cite=1]. The proof of this theorem is based on integral representation of harmonic functions in unbounded domain with non-compact boundary [\cite=3] and on the theorem 6.1 by E. M. Landis [\cite=2].

Crucial inequality

Let y = (y1,y2), x = (x1,x2), [formula], 0 < x2,y2 < h, [formula] with ρ > 0. For [formula] we can define a function Φ(y,x) by formula

[formula]

where η2 = u2  +  α2, α2 = (y1 - x1)2,

[formula]

a, ρ1 are positive numbers and 0 < ρ1  <  ρ. Then for the function Φ(y,x) the estimate

[formula]

is valid (here β2 = (y2 - x2)2 and C0  =  Const). The aim of this section is to prove the inequality ([\ref=5]).

If ω = x2 then by ([\ref=4]) we have

[formula]

As we have [formula], so [formula], henceforth

[formula]

Put β1 = y2 - x2 + 3h, r21  =  α2  +  β21, r2  =  α2  +  β2. It can be easily seen that

[formula]

As we have α  ≤  η, so

[formula]

Since

[formula]

there exists such ε > 0 that for |η|  <  ε the function

[formula]

is bounded. If |η|  ≥  ε then we have the inequality

[formula]

Moreover, we have [formula]. Thus we obtain

[formula]

where C1 is some constant. (Further by Ci we shall denote conctants) It is not difficult to obtain the following estimate:

[formula]

Estimate fromabove the function Φ(y,x). By ([\ref=6]) - ([\ref=9]) we obtain

[formula]

As

[formula]

the integral

[formula]

is convergent and as

[formula]

so

[formula]

Thus ([\ref=5]) is proved.

Proof of theorem

Provided that the conditions of the theorem are valid we have [\cite=3]

[formula]

Using ([\ref=1]) this formula can be written in the form

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Since γ1 is given by the equation y2 = f1(y1) where f1 is a bounded function with abounded derivative, by ([\ref=2]) and ([\ref=5]) we obtain

[formula]

where we denote by I11 (resp. by I12) the integral on the interval ( -   ∞  ,0) (resp. (0,  ∞  )). Estimate at first I12. We can write it in the form

[formula]

As [formula] wheny1∈(0, +   ∞  ), so

[formula]

By change of variables t = y1 - x1 we can write the last integral in the form

[formula]

because the integral

[formula]

is convergent. One can show that for the second integral a similar estimate is valid

[formula]

In the way similar to I12 we have

[formula]

By inequalities ([\ref=12]) - ([\ref=14]) we have

[formula]

The estimate of our integral on the path γ2 can be made in a similar way. Thus by ([\ref=10]) and ([\ref=15]) we have

[formula]

As [formula], so

[formula]

Hence using the theorem 6.1 of [\cite=2] we obtain that U(x)  ≤  0. Applying the above arguments for the function - U(x) we obtain that - U(x)  ≤  0. Thus [formula], x∈D. We are done.
