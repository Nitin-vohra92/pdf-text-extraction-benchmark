It is widely believed that the only plausible solution to the gauge hierarchy problem is N=1 local Supersymmetry [\cite=susy]. The gauge hierarchy problem arises from quadratically divergent one-loop corrections to the effective potential, those being of the form (Λ2StrM2 / (32π2)), where Λ is the momentum cut-off, while

[formula]

The sum is over all particles with field-dependent masses squared m2n and spin sn. Since M2 contains also the Higgs mass-squared, this term induces a divergent contribution destabilising the hierarchy MW <  < MPl, where MPl is the Planck mass.

In the spontaneously broken N=1 local Supersymmetry the StrM2, which appears as a coefficient of the one-loop quadratically divergent contributions, is given in terms of the field dependent gravitino mass m3 / 2 by the formula [\cite=FKZ]

[formula]

where the dimensionless function Q(z,) depends on the fields z and [formula] through the Rii tensor of the Kähler manifold and the function fab(z,) which determines the kinetic terms of the vector supermultiplets as well as the gauge coupling constants.

In the fundamental theory of quantum gravity the non-vanishing of Q(z,) would imply corrections to the effective potential of the order O(m23 / 2M2Pl) which cannot be cancelled by any contribution of low energy physics. The gravitino mass is given by

[formula]

where W(z) is the superpotential. The value of m3 / 2 is related to the scale of supersymmetry breaking which should not be much larger than the electroweak breaking scale. Since m23 / 2(z,) is field dependent, its vacuum expectation value (vev) should arise from the minimization of the potential. Then, quadratically divergent loop corrections proportional to StrM2 will induce either m3 / 2  →  0 (unbroken supersymmetry) or m3 / 2  →  MPl, therefore destabilizing again the hierarchy.

A possible solution to the hierarchy problem requires the vanishing of Q(z,) which motivated the no-scale supergravity models[\cite=noscale]. A further step towards this problem has been taken the last few years by going beyond the N=1 local Supersymmetry, the Superstring theory. In the context of the latter, and in particular of their four-dimensional version [\cite=4dstring], the effective supergravity theory is strongly restricted. It has been shown [\cite=FKZ] that there exist examples in supergravity theories preserving the general features of the superstring underlying theory which predicts a vanishing O(m23 / 2M2Pl) contribution. Such theories, however, will still leave a non vanishing contribution to the vacuum of the order O(m43 / 2) , which can be interpreted as a contribution to the cosmological constant

[formula]

The energy scale dependent coefficient η(Q) has a certain boundary condition on the unification scale. Its value there is dictated by the structure of the 'hidden' sector in the specific string model that has been chosen.

In reference [\cite=kpz], the gravitino mass has been treated as a dynamical variable. This would in turn imply that the low energy effective potential should be minimized not only with respect to the vev's of the Higgs fields but also with respect to m3 / 2. It has been stressed that this term cannot be absent in low energies as far as the gravitino mass is not taken as an external parameter. On the contrary, its contribution is determined by the evolution of the coefficient η(Q) from the GUT scale down to the low energies on the one hand, and the dynamical determination of m3 / 2 on the other hand.

In what follows we wish to analyse the above procedure in a realistic low energy supersymmetric theory. We take as an example the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which is endowed with all the salient features of an effective supergravity theory. We will show that under the very general characteristics of the above theories, the η(Q) is non-zero and negative at Q  ~  MZ, as long as m3 / 2 lies in the desirable range of 100 GeV to 1 TeV. Moreover the dynamical determination of the m3 / 2 scale through the minimization of the effective potential puts constraints of the scalar mass spectrum of the theory.

We consider therefore the MSSM. Following the discussion above, the only terms relevant to the potential (including quantum corrections) are the following

[formula]

V0(Q) is the (R.G.E. improved) tree-level potential while the appearance of the last term is due to the radiative corrections (at one-loop level) and its inclusion is necessary in order to stabilize the minimization procedure of the potential against Q [\cite=fabio].

The evolution of the parameter η(Q) is determined by a R.G.E. which can be derived by demanding that the potential V1(Q) is scale independent to the one-loop order, i.e.

[formula]

Since the above relation should hold for all values of the fields, in the case where v1 = v2 = 0, we have [\cite=kpz] [\cite=klnz] V0|vi = 0 = dV0 / dt|vi = 0 = 0, thus

[formula]

The above differential equation determines the value of η(t) in terms of StrM4 and the gravitino mass, once the initial values of η and of the mass parameters entering StrM4, at the unification scale, are known.

The initial value ηG, for example, is related in some specific models to the difference nB - nF where nB(F) are the bosonic (fermionic) degrees of freedom after supersymmetry breaking. An explicit derivation of the cosmological term, which can be identified with the contribution η(Q)m43 / 2 of (Eq.[\ref=v1]), is given in ref.[\cite=Ignatios]. In this treatment, the supersymmetry breaking scale is related to the size of a large internal dimension R. It was found that after the SUSY breaking, the one-loop contribution to cosmological constant is of the order of (αString / 4πR4)(ηB  -  ηF). For Z2  ×  Z2 orbifolds, the gravitino mass is [formula] , thus for broken SUSY one estimate that ηG  ≤  0.

The initial values of the scalar masses 2i, the gaugino mass m1 / 2 and of the μ parameter at the unification scale MG, can be parametrized in terms of m3 / 2

[formula]

where the ξ-coefficients are of O(1) (calculable in specific models). Therefore, the value of η(Q) at any scale Q < MG is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and fi(ξi,Q) can be calculated from the RGE running of the masses. Therefore, the parametrization of (Eq.[\ref=ksi's]) renders the value of η(Q), obtained from (Eq.[\ref=eta(Q)]), independent of m3 / 2.

For a given set of (ξα,ηG), the m3 / 2 value will be given by the minimization condition of the low energy potential with respect to m3 / 2 . This condition results to the equation [\cite=kpz]

[formula]

The latter has been interpreted as defining an infrared fixed point of the cosmological term, as it corresponds to the vanishing of the associated β-function. It is a significant constraint that should be satisfied by the m3 / 2 and ξα parameteres and the low energy values of the gauge couplings involved in V0(v1,v2).

In order to exploit the constraint of (Eq.[\ref=etamincond]), in the case where the complete spectrum of the MSSM is taken into account, we need the detailed Q-dependence of all the relevant parameters. We start with the classical tree-level potential which is given by

[formula]

[formula]

The minimization of the V0 potential with respect to v1,2 leads to the well known conditions

[formula]

[formula]

The conditions of (Eq.[\ref=mincond]) allow us to write the tree level potential in a simple form, exhibiting its dependence on the MZ mass. Substituting (Eq.[\ref=mincond]) into (Eq.[\ref=V0]) we get

[formula]

where v = 246GeV. We can use the minimization condition (Eq.[\ref=etamincond]) to determine the required low energy value of η(Q) as a function only of the parameters ξα and ξZ = (MZ / m3 / 2)2 and tan β, i.e. for Q  ~  MZ we get

[formula]

The above relation enables us to calculate the required low energy value of the cosmological coefficient η(Q) for any set of the parameters ξα choosing a phenomenologically acceptable m3 / 2 range. By solving then the corresponding RGE for η(Q), (Eq.[\ref=deta/dt]), we can determine a consistent range of values of η at the unification scale. Some general remarks concerning (Eq.[\ref=etamz]) are worth noting here.

First there is a positive contribution from the tree level potential which depends on ξZ and the angle β . For very large tan β, this term becomes almost independent of β as | cos 2β|  →  1. As m3 / 2 shifts to values much larger than MZ, then ξ2Z  ≪  1 and the positive contibution becomes negligible. There is a negative contribution, on the other hand, from the supertrace dependence which finally leads η(MZ) to negative values at mZ. Scalar mass and gaugino contibutions in the supertrace scaled by m3 / 2 are independent of the latter, being functions only of the ξα parameters and the scale dependent gauge functions. Therefore, the main m3 / 2 dependence enters through the logarithmic terms of the form [formula]. Therefore, the m3 / 2 value at which the minimum of the potential occurs, is intimately related to these terms.

The calculation of Str4 requires the knowledge of the boundary conditions (b.c.) for the scalars at the GUT scale, i.e. the knowledge of the ξα parameters. In the case of universal b.c., for example, one has ξi  =  ξ0 = m0 / m3 / 2 and ξ1 / 2 = m1 / 2 / m3 / 2, i.e. only two parameters in addition to ξZ. However, in the general case of supergravity theories ξi are in general different (non-universality) and the parameter space becomes more complicated. In addition, the RGEs for the scalars should also contain the contribution of the U(1)-D terms which plays a significant role for large deviations from the universality condition ξi  =  ξ0.

The important fact of the above described approach is that, for a specific supergravity or superstring model, up to an overall constant which can be identified with the gravitino mass, all the ξα's are known. If in addition the initial value of η(Q) at MG is known, equations (Eqs.[\ref=deta/dt],[\ref=etamincond]) can determine exactly the gravitino mass.

In practice, it is not trivial to write down, at least for the moment, a detailed spectrum of a realistic string model. Therefore, in the present analysis we prefer to follow the above described procedure using the general features of a supergravity theory. In this procedure, we treat as free parameters the coefficients ξα, varying them in a range close to unity, and use the complete spectrum of the MSSM to predict a consistent range of η(Q) at the unification scale. This bottom-up approach has as a prerequisite the knowledge of the gravitino mass whose value is supposed to be determined dynamically. We know however that, since supersymmetry breaking is related closely to the m3 / 2-scale, its value should be necessarily of the order of the electroweak scale. Our purpose is then to show that under realistic conditions and for a wide choice of the parameter space [formula] there are some stable and well defined predictions of the input value η(MG) which can be hopefully determined independently in specific string models. To put it in another way, using all the possible information of low energy physics, one can certainly support, or rule out, possible string constructions.

In the present work we stick in the low tan β regime and prefer to use semianalytic formulae to calculate the Str-contributions. To start with, in the case of non-universal conditions at the GUT scale for the soft terms, we generalize our previous formulae[\cite=leo] for the third generation of Squarks which are the only one affected by the heavy top contribution.

As in ref [\cite=kpz], we prefer to restrict our analysis in the case of the universal condition in the Higgs sector, although it seems interesting to consider the more general case. However, working in the low tan β regime, the non universality in the Higgs sector, m0H1 = m0H2, is not expected to play a significant role, contrary to the case of large tan β scenario. In the latter case, departure from universality[\cite=nonuni] is sometimes necessary to avoid instabilities in the low energy effective potential due to large negative corrections to both Higgs mass parameters. We give now the specific formulae which we are going to use.

The RGEs for the scalars receiving large ht Yukawa contribution are

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where S, in the case of MSSM, is given by

[formula]

The solution of the above system can be easily found through the solution of the differential equation obeyed by the sum of the three masses [formula], (where we have assigned 1  →  2Q, 2  →  2U and 3  →  m2H2),

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is worth noticing here that the (Eq.[\ref=dudt]) is independent of the S contribution, since the sum of the U(1) charges should be zero in the term QUH2 ( invariance of the Yukawa Lagrangian under U(1)). Of course, each individual mass gets a contribution from the S term. The solution of the differential equation is given by [\cite=leo]

[formula]

Following closely the formalism of ref.[\cite=leo] and taking into account that the At contributions are small, we can write the solution of the (Eq.[\ref=dmqdt]-[\ref=dmhdt]) in the form

[formula]

where the coefficients Cin(t) are defined in ref.[\cite=leo] and

[formula]

[formula]

where the differential equation obeyed by S, namely dS / dt = α1b1S / (2π), has been used. In the following we will stick in the case ξ3  =  ξH1 (universality in the Higgs sector) and that all three ξ1 / 2 are the same (universality in the gaugino sector).

The Str-term contibutions can be calculated now easily. We should point out that this calculation involves the μ parameter of the superpotential, which is unknown at the MG scale. However, in the bottom-up approach we are using here, the minimazation conditions at Q  ~  MZ determine the value μ at this scale. Its value at any scale can be obtained by generalizing (Eq.26) of ref.[\cite=leo] for the case for non-universal b.c., and evolve it using the relevant renormalisation group equation.

A final issue we should discuss before we present our numerical results, is the scale at which the required parameters should be calculated. Indeed, as we shall show soon, η(Q) varies substantialy as the scale approaches MZ and its value in very sensitive to the chosen scale. For a gravitino mass close to the value MZ it seems sensible to calculate all the relevant parameters at Q  ~  MZ. If we seek however solutions for m3 / 2  ≫  MZ, it would be appropriate to calculate the relevant quantities at a scale close to this value of m3 / 2. Then, according to our program we define as low energy value of η(Q) that one obtained from the minimization condition at Q  =  m3 / 2 and calculate the required initial condition ηG at MG.

We start our numerical investigations with the renormalisation group of the coefficient η(Q). Using Eq.([\ref=eta(Q)]), in Fig.1a we plot the coefficient η(Q) using as initial value ηG = 0, for three characteristic choices of the coefficients ξα, [formula]. By varying them in a reasonable range, we find that a crusial role is played by the choice of the coefficient ξ1 / 2. For each particlular choice of ξi's, we choose the value of ξμ so as to ensure radiative breaking of the SU(2)  ×  U(1) symmetry at the low energy scale. From the three curves shown in Fig.1a, the upper one corresponds to the choice [formula], the middle to the case to ξ1 / 2  =  1.8, while the lower to the value ξ1 / 2  =  5. We observe that the bigger the coefficient ξ1 / 2, the lower the value of η(QZ) obtained for the same initial condition ηG. This is of cource expected since larger contibutions in the StrM4, result also to a bigger value of η(Q) through (Eq.[\ref=eta(Q)]). It is clear from (Eq.[\ref=eta(Q)]) that a different initial condition ηG will result to a parallel shift of the obtained curves by the same amount. In Fig.1b we examine the sensitivity of the η(Q) with respect to the ξi parameters for given ξ1 / 2 = 1.8. We present three cases where the parameter S0 takes the values 3.6,3.3, - 1.6. Although we observe a significant variation of the η(QZ) value for the above choices, this is smaller than the one obtained by varying ξ1 / 2. On the other hand, there is no obvious interrelation between η(Q) and S0 values. The final η(MZ)'s depent solely on the specific choice of ξi's. On the contrary, we find a rather interesting correlation between η(Q) curves and the top Yukawa coupling. In Fig.1c we plot curves for htG = 1.8,2.6 and 3.0, while fixing all ξi's with ξ1 / 2 = 1.8. As can be read from the the curves, the higher the top coupling the lower the η(MZ) value.

In Figs.2-4 we present our results from the minimization procedure with respect to m3 / 2, varying the value of η(Q  ~  MZ) to a range close to the one obtained by the minimization condition of (Eq.[\ref=etamincond]). In our calculations we use MG  ≈  1.3  ×  1016GeV, αG  ≈  1 / 24.6 and a SUSY scale close to mtop. The obtained top mass is mtop  ≈  175GeV while we take tan β  ≈  1.8.

In Fig.2 we plot the low energy effective potential V1(MZ)vs m3 / 2 for a selected case where

[formula]

and three choices of ηZ =  - 4, - 2, - 1. The electroweak breaking occurs at Q  ~  450GeV. We notice in the graph that in the specific case mentioned above, for ηZ in the range ( - 1, - 3), the minimum of m3 / 2 is in the range (150,550)GeV. Of course, such a low ξ1 / 2 will result low masses for the gauginos, in particular for the larger ηZ values of the above range which give the lower m3 / 2 minimum. In Table I we give the masses of the SUSY particles scaled with the m3 / 2 mass.

Table I

The masses of the three gauginos and the other SUSY particles, scaled with the m3 / 2 mass, for the choices ξ1 / 2 = .25, ξQ  =  ξU = 2.5 and S0 =  - 3.5

In Figs.3a-b we present the case where ξ1 / 2 = 1.8 while all other ξ's are as before, for two different scales namely Q  ≈  MZ and Q  ≈  250GeV. The parameter η takes the values ( - 20, - 30, - 40, - 50). Table II shows the obtained supersymmetric spectrum scaled again with the m3 / 2. The scale of electroweak breaking is Q  ~  280GeV. Since now ξ1 / 2 is higher we expect the SUSY masses to be heavier than before.

Table II

The same as in Table I, for the choices ξ1 / 2 = 1.8, ξQ  =  ξU = 2.5 and S0 =  - 3.5

In Fig.3a, V(Q,m3 / 2) develops a minimum for n(MZ)  ≈  ( - 30, - 50) with a corresponding range of m3 / 2  ≈  (120 - 550)GeV. In Fig.3b, the minimum is obtained for larger η(Q) values being now in the range η(MZ)  ≈  ( - 25, - 35). The minimum at m3 / 2  =  300GeV corresponds to η(MZ)  ≈   - 40 in the first case (Fig.3a) and to η(250GeV)  ≈   - 31 for the second (Fig.3b). Again as η shifts to lower values, the minimum of m3 / 2  →    ∞  . Notice that within the above range, V1(Q) is stable with respect to the scale Q as expected.

Fig.4 represents a case with relatively large value of ξ1 / 2 = 5.0 and ξQ  =  ξD = 0.8 and S0 =  - 0.3. All the relevant parameters are calculated at Q = MZ, while the curves correspond to η = ( - 200, - 250, - 300, - 350). Finally we wish to point out that the cosmological coefficient receives naturally small values close to zero only in the first case, namely when m1 / 2  ≤  m3 / 2. From this point of view, a vanishing cosmological constant at Q  ~  MZ would require a considerabe fine tuning of the various parameters.

The three cases chosen above are in correspondence with the curves obtained from the renormalisation group running of the η-coefficient. Comparing the results with Fig.1, it can be seen that large positive ηG  ≥  O(100) values are required in order for the η(Q) value obtained from the RGE running to match with the low energy η's consistent with the minimization condition. The larger the value of ξ1 / 2, the higher the nG value required to obtain resonable m3 / 2 values dynamically.

In conclusion, we have discussed in detail the implications of the minimization of the vacuum energy with respect to the gravitivo mass. We have shown that the requirement of determining a hierarchically consistent gravitino mass dynamically, leads to useful constraints in low energy and Unification scale physics. In particular, we have seen that the existence of a V-minimum with respect to m3 / 2 necessitates the inclusion of the one loop corrections and of the cosmological term η(Q)m43 / 2, remnant from the underlying supergravity or string theory. Furthermore the minimization of the vacuum energy can naturally lead to m3 / 2 values at the order of the elecroweak scale m3 / 2  ~  (100 - 500)GeV and acceptable supersymmetric mass spectrum, in particular if m1 / 2  >  m3 / 2. Further constraints are also put on the ηZ parameter which can be easily converted to constraints for the initial value of the cosmological coefficient [formula]. In particular, small ηG values as required by specific string models are compatible with m1 / 2  ≤  m3 / 2 and small deviations from the universality condition for the scalars. In this case a sparticle spectrum compatible with the experimental bounds, requires m3 / 2  ≥  (3 - 4)  ×  MZ.

It is interesting that the above minimization procedure may also apply to other undetermined parameters of the standard model, i.e. Yukawa couplings and fermion masses [\cite=kpz] [\cite=kprz] [\cite=bd].
