ABSTRACT

plus 0.1pt minus 0.1pt Based on the recent CDF report on the top-quark, we have carried out an analysis on the Higgs mass within the minimal standard electroweak theory using the latest data on the W-mass. Although this theory is in quite a happy situation now, we wish to point out that more precise measurements of MW and mt in the future are crucial and they could come to require some new physics beyond it.

plus 0.2pt minus 0.1pt

Recently, CDF collaboration at Fermilab Tevatron collider has reported evidence of top-quark pair productions [\cite=Top]. There its mass has been estimated to be mexpt = 174  ±  16 GeV. Its final establishment must come after D0 collaboration confirms their results, but this observation will surely work as a new strong experimental support to the minimal standard electroweak theory with three fermion generations (the electroweak theory, hereafter). It is also noteworthy that very heavy top (~   160-180 GeV) has already been anticipated through analyses of low- and high-energy precision electroweak data [\cite=Pretop] before the above CDF report.

It seems that the electroweak theory is in a very happy situation. This is true at present, but one might feel that the above mexpt is a little too heavy. In this short note, we have studied this problem briefly. As a result, we wish to point out that more precise determinations of mt and MW might bring us into another very stimulating situation. The important point is the mφ(the Higgs-boson mass)-dependence of the MW-MZ relation derived from the μ-decay in the electroweak theory. We use here the MW-MZ formula given in [\cite=Hio], which has already been confirmed to be consistent with other calculations [\cite=Sir].

We start our discussion with summarizing phenomenological analyses on the Higgs mass. Ellis et al. obtained mφ  <   250 GeV at 95 % C.L. independently of mt [\cite=EFL]. The results by Novikov et al. in [\cite=Pretop] and by Jacobsen [\cite=Jac] are both not so drastic, but still low mφ is favored and 1σ region gives an upper bound [formula] 200-300 GeV. (In the latter analyses, the recent SLD measurement of sin 2θeffW [\cite=SLD] is also used.)

However, this does not mean that all the electroweak quantities used there demand low-mass Higgs boson. Indeed, the central value of MexpW (MexpW = 80.21  ±  0.18 GeV by UA2+CDF+D0 [\cite=Sal]) and that of mexpt(=174 GeV) require very heavy Higgs (~   1.7 TeV) via the well-known relation

[formula]

where α = 1 / 137.036, GF = 1.16639  ×  10- 5 GeV- 2, MZ = 91.1899  ±  0.0044 GeV [\cite=Cla], and [formula] is the one-loop corrections to the μ-decay amplitude. At present, it does not cause any serious trouble since mφ as low as 80 GeV is also allowed if we take into account [formula] GeV and [formula] GeV. That is, the mφ-dependence of the MW-MZ relation is not strong. That is why χ2 takes its minimum at low mφ even when MexpW is taken into account in an analysis.

When LEP II starts, the W-mass is expected to be determined very precisely: [formula] GeV [\cite=Kaw]. We may also expect that mt will eventually be measured with better precision. We assume here tentatively that [formula] GeV will be possible in the near future. In this case, a constraint from the W-mass becomes much stronger. Concretely, [formula] GeV produces an error of ±  0.03 GeV in the W-mass calculation. Combining this with [formula] GeV and a theoretical ambiguity [formula] GeV (which has been a bit overestimated for safety), we can compute MW - MexpW with an error of about ±  0.07 GeV. As an example, let us assume that the central values of MexpW and mexpt do not change. Then, MW - MexpW becomes 0.13  ±  0.07 GeV for mφ = 300 GeV. It means that mφ = 300 GeV is ruled out at 1.9σ level within the minimal standard electroweak theory. Similarly, even mφ = 600 GeV is not allowed though at 1.1σ level (MW - MexpW = 0.08  ±  0.07 GeV). To be consistent with the data at 1σ level, mφ has to be at least 650 GeV.

On the other hand, it is obvious that the upper bound on mφ derived in analyses without MW becomes lower than the one in those with MW since MexpW itself favors high mass Higgs. This means that we are led to another very exciting situation: MexpW demands heavy Higgs: [formula] 650 GeV, while the others need [formula] 200-300 GeV. As already mentioned, the central values of MexpW and mexpt demand mφ  ~   1.7 TeV. Even if we limit discussions to perturbation calculations, such extremely heavy Higgs will cause serious problems [\cite=DM] (see also [\cite=Ghi] and references cited therein).

It will be difficult to present this conclusion more strongly, e.g., at 3σ due to the well-known fact that low energy quantities do not have m2φ terms at one-loop order [\cite=Vel]. Nevertheless, if a situation like that comes to be real, it must be quite interesting, and we may need to consider some new physics beyond the standard electroweak theory which makes opposite contribution to MW and the other quantities. Precise measurements of MW and mt are therefore considerably significant.
