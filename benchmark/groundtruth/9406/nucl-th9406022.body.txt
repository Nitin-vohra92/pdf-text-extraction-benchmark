Partial Wave Analyses of the pp data alone and of the np data alone

Introduction

The last 15 years the Nijmegen group has been working on partial-wave analyses (PWA) of the N N-scattering data for energies below   =  350 MeV. In these analyses, the pp data furnish the I  =  1 phase shifts [\cite=Ber90] in the lower partial waves with J  ≤  4. It has been customary to do these low energy PWA up to   =  350 MeV, despite of the fact that the inelasticities set in at ≃280 MeV. It can be shown, however, that up to   =  350 MeV the inclusion of inelasticities in pp scattering improves the total [formula] with only about 1, so neglecting the inelasticities is totally warranted.

In the PWA of all the np data below   =  350 MeV, it has always been impossible to determine all important phase shifts, when only the np data were used. The standard procedure has therefore been to take the I  =  1 phases (except the 1S0) over from the pp analyses, with or without corrections for Coulomb, and np and π0π± mass difference effects. The 1S0 np phase shift was always searched for. It was found that there is a definite charge independence breaking in these 1S0 phases. An attempt by us, to extract all the lower I  =  0 and I  =  1 phase shifts in an analysis of all np data below   =  350 MeV failed. However, it was possible to determine the np 3P waves, when the higher partial waves were taken over from the pp analysis.

Recently, the Nijmegen group extended the pp PWA to energies so far above the pion production thresholds, that the inclusion of inelasticities was necessary. A preliminary version of such a PWA for all pp data with energies below   =  500 MeV has already been presented [\cite=Kok93].

When the np PWA was extended to energies up to   =  500 MeV, it turned out to be possible to determine uniquely all the important partial waves. Comparing then with the analogous pp analysis gives indications for possible charge independence breaking effects in other waves besides the 1S0 waves.

The method of analysis

In the np as well as in the pp partial wave analyses, the various phases are obtained by solving the relativistic Schrödinger equation with a well-known long-range potential   =    +   for r  ≥  b  =  1.4 fm. This [formula] contains the electromagnetic interaction (such as Coulomb, magnetic moment, and vacuum polarization), the OPEP tail, and the rest of the long range N N interaction as given by the Nijmegen potential [\cite=Nag78].

For r  <  b the short-range interaction is described by an energy-dependent, square-well potential

For [formula] we follow the same procedure as in the Nijmegen PWA and write

Results

The results of our PWA can be summarized as follows. The phase parameters were parametrized with 36 parameters in the pp analysis and 38 parameters in the np analysis. We allowed for up to four parameters in the real part of the potential in each partial wave, which was found to be enough. The actual number of parameters per partial wave varies from four in the 1S0 to one or none in the higher G waves. An imaginary part of the potential was only used in the 1D2  and 3F3 partial waves and in the pp PWA also in the coupled 3P2-3F2 partial waves. As an example, Fig. [\ref=dwave] shows preliminary results for the 1D2 partial wave. We reach   =  3555.4 for 3455 pp scattering data and   =  4142.0 for 3968 np scattering data.
