Abstract

In a previous paper, we have shown that a double phi peak structure appears in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum if a first order QCD phase transition occurs in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Furthermore, the transition temperature can be determined from the transverse momentum distribution of the low mass phi peak. In this work, we extend the study to the case that a smooth crossover occurs in the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic matter transition. We find that the double phi peak structure still exists in the dilepton spectrum and thus remains a viable signal for the formation of the quark-gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.

In a previous paper [\cite=ak94], we have proposed that a double phi peak structure in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to confirm the phase transition from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic matter. Furthermore, the transverse momentum distribution of the low mass phi peak allows us to determine the transition temperature.

The low mass phi peak results from the decay of phi mesons with reduced in-medium mass during the transition. The reduction of the phi meson mass in hot hadronic matter is a result of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry [\cite=pi82] [\cite=ha85] [\cite=ha92]. In normal effective field theory, hadron masses do not decrease at finite temperature and/or density [\cite=song] [\cite=hermann]. This result is, however, incomplete, because it neglects the modification of the vacuum due to medium effects. In QCD, the vacuum can be described in terms of expectation values of quark and gluon operators, i.e., condensates. The correlation function for current operators defined by quark fields can be calculated as a sum of condensates in the deep Euclidean region and can be identified as hadron spectrum function in timelike region. Values of the correlation function in these two regions are related to each other through the dispersion relation. The behavior of condensates at finite temperature and/or density can be calculated with appropriate approximation. Using these condensates on one side of the dispersion relation and the hadron spectrum function from an effective theory on the other side, it has been shown that hadron masses should decrease in the medium in order to satisfy the dispersion relation [\cite=akprr]. In the effective field theory, the vacuum effect can be also included via the nucleon antinucleon polarization. Recent studies show that this indeed leads to a reduction of meson masses at finite temperature and/or density [\cite=gao] [\cite=jpw93] [\cite=sh94] [\cite=sxk94].

If a first order phase transition occurs between the quark-gluon plasma and the hadronic matter in heavy ion collisions as assumed in Ref. [\cite=ak94], the system spends a relatively long time in the mixed phase (about 10-15 fm) during which the phi meson mass stays almost constant at a value different from that in free space. Since the duration of the mixed phase is not negligible compared to the lifetime of the phi meson in vacuum (~  45 fm), a low mass phi peak besides the normal one thus appears in the dilepton spectrum. As the transverse flow during the mixed phase is not appreciable, the transverse momentum distribution of the low mass phi meson is largely determined by the temperature of the mixed phase and provides thus the information on the transition temperature.

In the scenario described in Ref. [\cite=ak94], we have ignored the following effects: (i) the collisional broadening of the phi meson width due to its interaction with hadrons; (ii) the increase of the phi meson width in the mixed phase due to its interaction with partons in the quark-gluon phase; and (iii) the possibility of a smooth transition from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic matter instead of the mixed phase. If these effects are large, then the secondary phi peak proposed in Ref. [\cite=ak94] may not appear. Effects (i) and (ii) have recently been studied in Refs. [\cite=sk93] and [\cite=sk94], respectively. It has been found that the collision of the phi meson with hadrons increases its width to about 10 MeV while its interaction with partons adds another few MeV in the width. The resulting phi meson width remains small enough to make the secondary phi peak visible. In this paper, we shall study if the double phi peak structure is still present in the dilepton spectrum in the case of a smooth transition from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic matter.

According to recent lattice calculations [\cite=co90], the QCD phase transition is a crossover but very close to the first order one. There exists a sudden change in the entropy density within a temperature interval of less than ~   10 MeV [\cite=cr92]. To incorporate these features of the QCD phase transition, we parametrize the temperature dependence of the entropy density s of the hot matter as follows:

[formula]

where sh(T)  =  12aT3 and sq(T)  =  148aT3 with a = π2  /  90 are the bag model entropy density with two flavors in the hadron and the quark phase, respectively; Tc is the critical temperature; m, ~ n and Γ are constants. The typical width of the phase transition is given by 2Γ with [formula] MeV according to lattice calculations. For temperatures that satisfy |T - Tc|  ≫  Γ, the entropy density given by Eq. ([\ref=sdens]) approaches asymptotically to sh(T) and sq(T), respectively, for T below and above Tc. We have introduced m and n to include the possibility of an asymmetric phase transition. The case m / n =  1 corresponds to a symmetric phase transition. For m / n > 1, the transition is asymmetric, and the entropy density changes more in the quark phase than in the hadron phase.

The pressure P and the energy density e can be straightforwardly evaluated from the entropy density. In this paper, we take the chemical potential to be zero, as we are interested in the central region of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, where the baryon density is expected to almost vanish. Then, the pressure and the energy density are given by

[formula]

We note that only one of the three quantities s, P, and e is independent at fixed temperature T and chemical potential. In Figs. 1-3, we show s, P, and e by solid lines as functions of temperature. The parameters used in evaluating these quantities are Tc  =  180 MeV, Γ  =  5 MeV, and m / n = 1. The dashed lines show the equation of state obtained from the standard bag model.

In the following calculations, we use the same temperature dependence of the phi meson mass as in Ref. [\cite=ak94]. This is shown in Fig. 4. The decrease of the phi meson mass is mainly due to the presence of a considerable number of strange particles at high temperatures. The details can be found in Refs. [\cite=ak94] [\cite=ak92]. As in Ref. [\cite=ak94], the rho meson mass is taken to have the following temperature dependence

[formula]

and the omega meson mass is independent of temperature. The difference in the temperature dependence of vector meson masses is due to the difference in their isospin [\cite=hkl92]. We would like to point out that the double phi peak structure in the dilepton spectrum depends more on the existence of the shift of the phi meson mass at finite temperature than the magnitude of the shift.

We assume that in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions the system has a cylindrical symmetry and is in thermal equilibrium. All formulas used in the following calculation are given in Ref. [\cite=ak94]. In particular, we include a normalized smearing function of Gaussian form for the phi meson mass in order to take into account the experimental mass resolution:

[formula]

where σ is a constant and is taken to be 10 MeV [\cite=ph92].

Assuming boost invariance, we have carried out a hydrodynamical calculation with transverse flow for a central collision of 197 Au   +    197 Au. We have modified the code of Ref. [\cite=lm91] to include the smooth quark-gluon plasma to hadronic transition. We have used the following values for the parameters [\cite=ak94] [\cite=ak93]: the initial proper time, τ0  =   1 fm, and the initial radial velocity at the surface of the cylinder, v0  =   0; the initial temperature, T0  =   250 MeV, the critical temperature, Tc  =   180 MeV, and the freeze out temperature, Tf  =   120 MeV; one half of the typical width of the crossover transition, Γ  =   5 MeV and the asymmetry factor of the crossover, m / n =  1. Unless specified otherwise, we use these default values in the calculation. In addition, we have assumed that the volume fraction of the hadron phase is 1 and 0 at T < Tc and T  ≥  Tc, respectively.

In Fig. 5, we show by the solid line the invariant mass distribution of lepton pairs dN / dMdy. We see that the second phi peak between the omega meson and the normal phi meson is still visible as in the case of a first order phase transition [\cite=ak94]. The low mass phi peak is, however, somewhat broadened as the temperature in the present case does not stay exactly at the same value during the transition. For comparison, we have also plotted in Fig. 5 the result for an asymmetric case by the dashed line. The asymmetric factor is chosen to be m / n  =  3. In this case, the entropy density drops much more in the quark-gluon phase than in the hadron phase. This makes, however, practically no difference in the dilepton spectrum as the temperature stays near the critical temperature Tc = 180 MeV (doted line in Fig. 6) for a relatively long time in both the symmetric and the asymmetric case which are shown in Fig. 6 by the solid and the dashed line, respectively. To understand this, we take the Bjorken scaling solution without transverse expansion and denote the critical entropy density as sc, which is given by

[formula]

The duration [formula] for which the temperature remains near constant is then approximately given by

[formula]

Since sq(Tc)  /  sh(Tc) is very large (= 37 / 3), [formula] is barely affected by any reasonable change of the asymmetry factor.

In Ref. [\cite=ak94], we have pointed out that for a first order phase transition the second phi peak does not appear if the initial temperature is less than the critical temperature. This is not the case for a smooth crossover as shown Fig. 7, in which the initial temperature is taken to be 175 MeV and is less than the critical temperature. The reason for this is that for the crossover transition the temperature does not stay exactly at Tc but around Tc, so the second phi peak is expected to be visible if Tc - T0 Γ is satisfied even if T0  <  Tc. The result of our numerical calculation supports this.

If the critical temperature is small, it is possible that the second phi peak may not be observed due to the small separation from the normal phi meson peak. In Fig. 8, we show by the solid line the result from the calculation with a lower critical temperature, Tc  =  160 MeV. The second peak is still visible. However, if the width parameter Γ of the crossover transition is larger, the second phi peak becomes broader and merges to the normal one. This is shown by the dashed line in Fig. 8 for a larger width parameter, Γ  =  10 MeV, and the same critical temperature Tc  =  160 MeV. We note that as in a first order transition our results do not change qualitatively for higher initial temperatures [\cite=ge92] [\cite=sh92] [\cite=km92] as long as the critical temperature is kept the same [\cite=ak94].

In Ref. [\cite=ak94], we have also pointed out that the critical temperature for the QCD phase transition can be extracted reasonably accurately from the transverse momentum distribution of the low mass phi meson peak in the dilepton spectrum. A similar proposal to measure the phase transition temperature with the transverse momentum distribution of dileptons from rho mesons was proposed by Seibert [\cite=sei92]. The method with the phi meson, however, has several advantages over the latter one: (i) The second peak originates exclusively from the matter near the critical temperature, so the signal to noise ratio is large; (ii) The transverse flow is still small near the phase transition. Therefore, the transverse momentum distribution of the second peak reflects more faithfully the critical temperature; and (iii) The phi peak is narrower than the rho peak, which makes the subtraction of backgrounds easier. We have repeated the same procedure as we did in Ref. [\cite=ak94] and have confirmed that the transition temperature can also be extracted from the low mass phi meson peak in the case of the crossover transition. In Fig. 9, we show the slope parameter of the dilepton distribution at small transverse momenta as a function of the initial temperature. The solid curve is the slope parameter of the low mass peak at about 916 MeV. It changes only slightly as the initial temperature increases. On the other hand, the slope parameter of the normal phi meson peak at 1019 MeV changes significantly as the initial temperature increases due to the resultant development of an appreciable transverse flow in the hadron phase. We note especially the sudden increase of the slope parameter of the normal phi meson peak in the region, Tc  -  Γ T Tc  +  Γ, where the entropy density changes rapidly as the temperature increases.

In summary, due to the reduction of the phi meson mass in a hot matter and the sudden change of the entropy density at the phase transition, a distinct low mass peak besides the normal one appears in the dilepton spectrum even if the quark-gluon plasma to hadronic matter transition in heavy ion collisions is not first order. This concludes a series of investigations on the possibility of a double phi peak structure in the dilepton spectrum from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. With all factors which could potentially weaken the double phi peak structure ruled out, the low mass phi peak is thus a credible tool to verify the occurrence and to determine the critical temperature of QCD phase transition in future ultrarelativistic heavy ion experiments.
