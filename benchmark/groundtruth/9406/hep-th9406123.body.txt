A particular class of random walks with a spin factor on a three dimensional cubic lattice is studied. This three dimensional random walk model is a simple generalization of random walk for the two dimensional Ising model. All critical diffusion constants and associated critical exponents are calculated. Continuum field theories such as Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons theories are constructed near several critical points.

It is well-known that relativistic field theory of spinning particles in three dimensional Euclidian space can be described in a continuum random walk representation [\cite=P] - [\cite=T]. The free energy of spinning particles with spin J is represented as a particle path integral by using SU(2) coherent state [\cite=Ch], and eventually one obtains a geometric form

[formula]

where Jμ is a spin matrix with the magnitude J and exp [iJΦ] is the spin factor. Φ[null] is defined as the area enclosed by a path e(t) on a two dimensional unit sphere. In the right hand side of ([\ref=cr]), the value of Φ is a functional of the unit tangential vector on a path of the particle. This model shows some nontrivial critical behaviors involved in different universality class from Brownian motion. A typical path becomes much smoother than that in the Brownian motion because of the spin factor. Then, this model is sometimes called a rigid path model. This representation of spinning particles ([\ref=cr]) has been employed to argue the Bose-Fermi transmutation in three dimensional relativistic field theory [\cite=P] [\cite=IIM] [\cite=T]. However, the naive continuum theory yield some subtle problems. The point splitting regularization employed there neglects contributions of paths with intersection points, which may affect the critical behavior. Despite the fractal structure of paths in random walk, the topological formula used in the argument is verified by a differential geometry of the path. Although a typical path of spinning particles is much smoother than that of the Brownian motion, we can claim only its possibility. The reliability of this non-perturbative consequence derived by a continuuum theory remains unclear. Thus, more rigorous studies based on lattice regularization are desired.

In this letter, we construct continuum field theories of relativistic spinning particles in terms of random walks on a three dimensional lattice. Random walk with the spin factor is defined on lattice space instead of the naive continuum path integral ([\ref=cr]). Here, the continuum limit in this model is discussed more rigorously. This random walk model is a simple generalization of the diffusion process used for solving the two dimensional Ising model [\cite=V] to three dimensional models with other spins. We find all critical points and study their critical behaviors. Continuum field theories of Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons fields can be constructed at corresponding critical points. These results are consistent with the continuum path integral ([\ref=cr]).

We consider a Markovian diffusion process on a three dimensional cubic lattice with an amplitude depending on the preceding step. To obtain the free energy, we evaluate a sum over all paths leaving and returning to the origin. Let x and eα be a lattice site and a bond indices, respectively. The length of each bond is taken to be unity. We construct a diffusion process on lattice which corresponds to the naive continuum path integral for spinning particles. We define a probability amplitude Aαβt(x) of finding the particle after t steps at a site x coming from x  -  eβ. Here, Aαβt(x) satisfies a recursion relation

[formula]

where κ is a diffusion constant, J is a spin parameter and S(eα,eβ,eγ) is the area of a spherical triangle with vertices eα, eβ and eγ. The sum is taken over all nearest neighbor bonds eγ at the site x, where we denote e-  γ =  - eγ. In our model any back tracking process is forbidden, that is

[formula]

The initial condition is given by

[formula]

This model is expected to be a lattice version of the continuum random walk model ([\ref=cr]). Here, we consider only half integer J for simplicity. This diffusion process in two dimensions with [formula] is well-known as a convinient tool for calculating the partition function of the two dimensional Ising model. In this representation, Majorana spinor is obtained as a critical theory of the two dimensional Ising model. Our three dimensional diffusion model can be regarded as its generalization. As in the two dimensional Ising model, we define a free energy f(κ,J) per unit volume by

[formula]

In momentum space we obtain the Fourier transformed recursion relation as a block diagonal form

[formula]

where Bαβt(p) is the Fourier transform of the amplitude Aαβt(x). The matrix Q(p,J) has the form

[formula]

The solution of the recursion equation ([\ref=frc]) is

[formula]

The free energy can be written in terms of the matrix Q(p,J)

[formula]

This sumation is calculated at least formally.

[formula]

Physical quantities become nonanalytic at the critical point as a function of the diffusion constant κ. If the fundamental length scale diverges at the critical point, the critical behavior can be described by a continuum field theory. Our model at several critical points can be described by certain relativistic spinning fields whose mass matrices are determined by [formula]. A critical diffusion constant κc is determined by the eigenvalue equation of [formula]

[formula]

At κ  =  κc, the free energy becomes nonanalytic. Since S(eα,eβ,eγ) in ([\ref=rec]) is quantized by [formula] in our idenical cubic lattice, the eigenvalue equation possess the symmetry J  →  4 - J. If we consider half-integer J, then J takes [formula]. For each J, we find solutions of ([\ref=ee]) as follows:

One can see several degeneracies. At n-th degenerate critical point, the amplitude is expressed as a linear combination of n independent eigenvectors and can survive as an excitation with long range correlation. One can trust the formula ([\ref=fe2]) only for bigger |κ|- 1 than the maximal absolute value of eigenvalues |κc|- 1 because of the convergent radius of the infinite sum ([\ref=sum]). Thus we have to be concerned about only critical points [formula], (2, -3) and (2, 3). One can constructs relativistic field theories at critical points (J,κ- 1) = (0,5), [formula], (1,3) and (2, - 3), if one tunes the diffusion constant κ to these critical points κc. Those with single, double and triple degeneracies give us Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons fields, respectively. We do not find any other critical points that give continuum field theory.

First, we show the behavior of the free energy at critical points which give relativistic field theories. At (J,κ- 1) = (0,5) and (2, - 3), the critial behaviors belong to the same universality class. The free energy at (0,5(1 + s)) is given

[formula]

where we introduce small parameter s

[formula]

This critical behavior belongs to the same universality class of the Brownian motion. The correlation length diverges at the critical point as [formula], thus the critical exponent [formula]. This critical point gives the Klein-Gordon theory as the continuum limit. The free energy near these two critical points behave as

[formula]

This indicates that the order of the phase transition is second and the critical exponent [formula].

At [formula] , the free energy is

[formula]

The correlation length becomes s- 1, and then ν = 1 and α =  - 1. The two component Dirac field is obtained as the continuum limit at this critical point.

[formula]

where σ is the Pauli matrix used as the gamma matrix in three dimensions. Other four components correspond to heavy particles which does not affect critical phenomena.

At (J,κ- 1)  =   (1, 3), the nonanalytic part of the free energy at [formula] is evaluated as follows:

[formula]

The free energy can be written also in terms of the following masssive vector field

[formula]

where the matrix [formula] L is a spin matrix with the magnitude 1. One can take (Lμ)νλ  =  iεμνλ. Two critical exponents α =  - 1 and ν = 1 are same as those of the Dirac field. The continuum limit is taken practically by s  →  0 after the replacement p  →  sνp. The model has infinite ultraviolet cutoff by this procedure. The lagrangians of three types of relativistic field theories constructed above are given for the Klein-Gordon field

[formula]

the Dirac field

[formula]

and the massive U(1) Chern-Simons field

[formula]

Above these three types of critical theories agree with the result given by the naive continuum path integral ([\ref=cr]).

The order of phase transition at [formula], and (2,3) becomes higher than the second and then the continuum limit can exist at those critical points. One might expect spin [formula] relativistic field theory at these critical points. Nevertheless, these continuum theories possess no rotational symmetry, and thus these obtained continuuum theories cannot be relativistic. For example, the free energy at [formula] becomes

[formula]

This shows no rotational invariance, even though one takes the limit s  →  0. Even if one neglects the rotational non-invariant term of O(p4) in ([\ref=rs]), the result does not agree with that of the naive continuum path integral ([\ref=cr]). Fourth degenerate critical point is supposed to correspond to [formula] continuum path integral ([\ref=cr]) which gives

[formula]

This differs from ([\ref=rs]) even in the long wave approximation.

In this letter, we studied quantum diffusion process with a spin factor. Relativistic field theories of Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons fields have been constructed by taking continuum limit near critical points. On the other hand, however, field theory with a spin higher than 1 have not been obtained. It remains to check the universality of these obtained results in other lattice spacing. More detailed and subsequent works are going to be reported soon.
