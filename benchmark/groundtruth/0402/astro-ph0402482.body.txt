The cosmological evolution of the environments of powerful radio galaxies

Observations

To break the degeneracy effect found between radio-power and redshift in previous studies we defined 3 subsamples of sources chosen from the 3C and 6C/7C catalogues. For full details on the sample selection and the data reduction see Goodlet et al.[\cite=me], hereafter G04. Spectral index, rotation measure and depolarisation were derived from the observations and were averaged over individual lobes. We define the spectral index, α, by [formula]. The difference in α, DM and RM between the two lobes of an individual source is given by dα, dDM and dRM respectively. The rms variation of the rotation measure is defined by σRM.

Theoretical modelling

The large scale structure of FRII sources is formed from twin jets emerging from a central AGN buried inside the nucleus of the host galaxy. The jets propagate in opposite directions from the core of the source and end in strong shocks. The jet material inflates a lobe surrounding the jet, which drives a bow shock into the surrounding medium. Kaiser & Alexander[\cite=ka97] (KA) showed that in a purely dynamical model of FRII evolution, the bow shock and lobe grow self-similarly. The KA model assumes a power-law for the external density distribution, [formula] and a constant rate of energy injection into the lobe, Q[formula]. The length of the jet, Dlobe, grows with time proportional to [formula]. Kaiser et al.[\cite=kat97] (KDA) added synchrotron radio emission to the dynamical model of KA. The model self-consistently incorporates the effects of all relevant energy losses on the relativistic electrons giving rise to the synchrotron emission. This allows us to calculate the total radio luminosity Pν of the lobe. The density of the environment is parameterised by [formula] and is related to the Dlobe, Q[formula] and the age of the source. Using the flux measurements at our 3 observing frequencies and the model of KDA, we constrained the lobe pressure and external density of all sources in our samples. Q[formula] and the source age were then calculated from the best fit parameters.

Results

DM and σRM, which are indirect measurements of density, increase with redshift. Unfortunately this was not observed in the density parameter [formula]. DM and σRM may increase with redshift because the environments are more disturbed rather than denser. This may fit with observations indicating a higher degree of distortions of the large scale radio structure of objects at high redshift objects. Spectral index was found to be independent of all the other source properties. Larger sources are older, as expected for ram pressure confined jets. Sources with larger jet-powers are more luminous. Lobe pressure correlates strongly with lobe size and the radio luminosity of the source.
