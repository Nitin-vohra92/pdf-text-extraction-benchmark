Special Symplectic Subgroup over Integers Arising as a Factor of The Braid Group

Introduction

The braid group can be defined in many ways and since its introduction in [\cite=Art1] [\cite=Art2], one of them is a representation in the group of automorphisms of the free group. If the generators of the free group are [formula], the action of the braid group is given by

[formula]

Here σ1, , σn are the standard generators of the braid group Bn + 1 on n + 1 strands.

This action can be considered also over any ordered set of elements of a group. It appears when one considers a fiber bundle [formula] over the plane with n + 1 punctures. Let the bundle be equipped with a complete flat connection and Mt  =  π- 1(t) to be the fiber of M over t. For any loop γ based at t, we may integrate the connection on M along γ to obtain a homomorphism

[formula]

which, as the connection is flat, depends only on the homotopy class of γ. In this way a representation of the fundamental group is obtained

[formula]

called the monodromy representation. The braid group enters when one considers continuous deformation of the points [formula] and the connection, in a way preserving the monodromy. The possibility of such deformations for systems of Fuchsian differential equations is proved in [\cite=Sch] by constructing an integrable Pfaffian differential equation, which the coefficients must satisfy in order to preserve the monodromy. Solutions to these equations correspond to orbits of the braid group on tuples of linear transformations [formula], Ai∈GL(V), subject to the equivalence [formula], as the monodromy is fixed only up to simultaneous conjugation. Because of this, the braid

[formula]

where [formula], will act trivially. It is known [\cite=Bir] that the braid Δ2 generates the center of Bn + 1.

One class of linear transformations, on which the action of the braid group is particularly simple, is that of reflections. A reflection in a linear space V, equipped with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, can be written as [formula], where the vector v satisfy 〈v|v〉 = 2. The relative position of n + 1 reflections [formula], [formula] is be specified by their Gram matrix

[formula]

We arrive at an action of the braid group, factored over its center, on the Gram matrices. It has the following form

[formula]

The symmetric matrices Kσ(G) depend on the braid as well as on the Gram matrix, therefore the action is nonlinear on the entries of the Gram matrix.

In [\cite=DM] were found all finite orbits of the braid group action on triples of reflections, having nondegenerate Gram matrix. It was shown that these orbits correspond to pairs of reciprocal regular polyhedra or star-polyhedra, while the elements in the orbits correspond to the Schwarz triangles (see [\cite=Cox]). Motivated by this result, in the present article we study the orbits of the braid group on arbitrary number of reflections with Gram matrix of rank 2. This is the first nontrivial case with respect to the rank as the orbits on rank 1 matrices are trivial.

In the next section is introduced angular parametrization of the rank 2 Gram matrices. It is shown that the action of the braid group Bn + 1 is linear on these parameters yielding a representation into the group of integer valued matrices with determinant one

[formula]

This can be obtained from the Burau representation [\cite=Bur] by substituting t =  - 1. It has been considered in [\cite=Arn] for even n, while for odd n their representation differs from the one considered here.

Then it is shown that there is an antisymmetric form on the lattice [formula], preserved by the action of ρ(Bn + 1). This is a surprising result as we begin with the braid group action on orthogonal reflections and arrive at representation in the integer valued symplectic group [formula] for even n. For odd n the representation is reducible [formula].

In the last section are found the finite orbits of the braid group on the Gram matrices of rank 2 and the linear representations are characterized by showing that the image Gn  =  ρ(Bn + 1) of the braid group is a congruence subgroup of level 2 i.e. it contains the principal subgroup of level 2

[formula]

where it is meant the natural homomorphism by reducing the entries to modular arithmetics. For odd n, correspondingly, the principal congruence subgroup is

[formula]

However it is not modular reductive i.e. the matrices in Gn do not have the form

[formula]

in any basis, which is the best known example of congruence subgroups.

Linearization of the action of the braid group

Let there is a collection of n + 1 reflections, preserving a nondegenerate (not necessarily positive definite) symmetric bilinear form 〈  ·  |  ·  〉. In such case the reflections must have the form

[formula]

for some vectors [formula], such that 〈vi|vi〉 = 2. The relative position of these reflections is given by the Gram matrix Gij  =  〈vi|vj〉 = 2. Substituting [\eqref=refl] in [\eqref=braid] and calculating the Gram matrix of the transformed vectors we obtain

[formula]

where the symmetric matrix Kσ for the generators of the braid group is given by

[formula]

These transformations can be written compactly as [\eqref=sym].

Every symmetric matrix G of rank 2 for which Gii = 2 can be written

[formula]

for some complex [formula]

We let Gij = 2gij for ease of notation. Every [formula] submatrix of G must be degenerate therefore also every [formula] submatrix of g will be degenerate. Taking the 1-st, i-th and j-th row and column

[formula]

We write Gij = 2 cos φij. The above identity implies

[formula]

hence

[formula]

where φi  =  φ1i. Taking another submatrix of the rows numbered 1,i,k and the columns numbered 1,i,j

[formula]

The cosine is an even function so we may take ε1i =  - 1. The sign of εij does not matter if [formula] so we let εij =  - 1 in such case i.e. when sin φi sin φj = 0. We have [formula], [formula] for some [formula]. If εki = 1 for some i we change

[formula]

In this way we assure εki =  - 1 for every i. From [\eqref=det2] it follows that

[formula]

when [formula] but we have set εij =  - 1 in the other case too.

In our problem the matrix G defines the relative position of reflections. Each reflection given by a vector v can be given also by - v, so there is an equivalence between matrices G defining the same reflection arrangement

[formula]

In our parameterization this equivalence allows the change

[formula]

Another freedom in the parameterization by angles φi is due to the appearance of only cosine function of them which is an even function and allows the simultaneous inversion of their signs.

The action of standard generators of Bn + 1 on the angles φi is given by

[formula]

These transformations define a linear representation of Bn + 1 on [formula]. The angles φi parameterize matrices Bij = 2 cos (φi  -  φj) therefore we have the identification [formula]. Using [\eqref=lesspi] we further identify [formula]. In this context the action [\eqref=transfi] must be considered over [formula].

The action of Bn + 1 on the parameters [formula], [formula] defined by [\eqref=transfi] will have finite orbit if and only if [formula].

The matrices of the transformations [\eqref=transfi] are unipotent with a common eigenvector [formula] corresponding to a Gram matrix of rank 1. Apart from this case there exist some i such that [formula]. There must be a power σki, which acts trivially on [formula] in order to have a finite orbit.

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Parameters obeying the above condition on their differences, are written as [formula], where φ is a common phase, preserved by the transformations [\eqref=transfi]. Let [formula]. We write [formula], and we may always take 0  ≤  ri < m because of the identification [formula]. The transformations [\eqref=transfi] preserve φ,m and as there are finite number of values for [formula] the condition of the theorem is also sufficient.

Up to here we have not used the fact that in [\eqref=param] enter only the differences φi  -  φj. Calling [formula] we obtain that the Gram matrices of rank 2 belonging to finite orbits of the braid group are written as

[formula]

where [formula].

The generators of Bn + 1 transform the parameters [formula] in the following way

[formula]

where i > 1.

In order to classify the orbits of this image of the braid group on [formula] it is useful first to consider these transformations on [formula]. The action [\eqref=act] on [formula] can be interpreted by considering reflections about points on the real line with integer coordinates [formula]. Each reflection is determined by the coordinate ki of the point it stabilizes. The action [\eqref=braid] of the braid group on these reflections induce transformations on the coordinates of their stable points, and their differences transform according to [\eqref=act].

The obtained linear representation of the braid group factored over its center is not faithful - there are additional relations between generators which together with the standard relations ([\cite=Bir]) between the generators

[formula]

[formula]

determine it as an abstract group. Notice that one of the relations in [\eqref=genrel] is redundant as

[formula]

using [\eqref=genrel1].

Let us call this linear group Gn. Clearly the inverses of σi are also represented by matrices with integer entries hence [formula]. We are interested in the orbits of Gn on the lattice [formula]. If the number of reflections n + 1 is even, their product will be a translation, invariant under the action of Gn. It gives an invariant one-dimensional subspace in [formula]. We introduce new coordinates

[formula]

so that the last coordinate xn remains invariant under all σi if n + 1 is even.

The antisymmetric form

[formula]

is non-degenerate and invariant under the action of Gn

[formula]

if n is even. It is preserved by σi  ,  i > 1 and has one-dimensional kernel when n is odd.

The action of the generators σi of the group Gn in the coordinates xi is

[formula]

so

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] be the basis vectors in [formula], for the coordinates [formula].

[formula]

The vectors

[formula]

are linearly independent and satisfy

[formula]

hence they form a canonical basis for the form J. If n is odd Qn belongs to the kernel of J.

It follows that our group is contained in the symplectic group over integers [formula], if n = 2s. It is rather unexpected to appear symplectic group when we consider sets of orthogonal reflections. It demonstrates an interesting duality between ordered sets of reflections and ordered sets of transvections. The last are linear transformations with nontrivial Jordan form, fixing pointwise hyperplanes of codimension one. If there is a preserved alternating form, the relative position of n transvections [formula] is determined by the matrix

[formula]

Here 〈  ·  |  ·  〉 is the alternating form and 〈vi|vi〉 = 0. If we write the matrix H as the difference between an upper triangular matrix S with units on the diagonal and its transposed, we see that to any set of symplectic transvections there is a corresponding set of reflections whose Gram matrix is G = S + St. The orthogonal reflections with Gram matrix of rank 2 and finite orbit of the braid group action generate finite dihedral groups, as we have seen. The braid action on them linearizes and the images of canonical generators of the braid group are exactly the set of transvections, corresponding to the standard generators of the Coxeter group An.

The quantity δ defined by

[formula]

[formula]

is an invariant of the action of G2s.

First let us note that the greatest common divisor is an invariant for all invertible linear transformations with integer coefficients. We may assume γ = 1 so α is the number of odd ki-s. If we denote by β = 2s - α the number of even coordinates ki the action [\eqref=act] preserves α,β except for σ1 which for odd k1 converts

[formula]

This transformation has period 2 and preserves δ = |α  -  β - 1|.

It follows that G2s is a proper subgroup of [formula] as the last preserves only the greatest common divisor γ which follows from the determination of its generators in [\cite=Sieg] . We will prove that the pair δ,γ characterizes completely the orbits of G2s in [formula]. For this purpose we first introduce the natural coordinates qi,pj for the form J so that Qi,Pj be the basis vectors.

[formula]

In these coordinates the invariant form J is given by

[formula]

and the action of G2s by

There is one-to-one correspondence between the orbits of the action of G2s on [formula] and the pairs δ,γ. The values which these invariants may take are:

[formula]

As we already proved δ,γ are preserved by G2s. It remains to show that G2s acts transitively on the vectors in [formula] with equal quantities δ,γ. We will prove it by giving an algorithm transforming any vector in [formula] to a canonical representative in each orbit.

so that the new coordinates (i,p̃i) are again canonical for J, and the subspace [formula] coincides with [formula]. In these coordinates

As [formula], Zi transposes i and i + 1. The transformations V1,U1,Z1 generate the principal congruence subgroup of index 2 in [formula] with respect to the action on the coordinate pair 1,2. Using a modified Euclidean algorithm we may transform to [formula] or to 1  =  2 > 0 in the following way. Change the sign of 1 or 2 by V1 or Z1V1Z1 to make them both non-negative. Next apply Z1 if necessary to make 1  >  2; and V1U- 11:1  ↦  1 - 22 decreasing the absolute value of 1. Continue in the same fashion until either 1  =  2 or 2 = 0.

To assure that there are not distinct canonical representatives with equal quantities δ,γ we check

Next we consider the case of even number of reflections n = 2s + 1. In this case xn is an invariant, measuring the length of the translation [formula].

Although in this case the antisymmetric form J is not preserved by σ1 we will use its natural coordinates qi,pi introduced by [\eqref=kx1]-[\eqref=kx2].

The triple γ,δ,x2s + 1, defined by

[formula]

[formula]

remains invariant under the action of G2s + 1 on [formula].

The proof is the same as with the even-dimensional case. The invariance of x2s + 1 was mentioned when these coordinates were introduced [\eqref=kx1].

There is one-to-one correspondence between the orbits of G2s + 1 in [formula] and the triples γ,δ,x2s + 1. The values which these invariants may take are

[formula]

First let us note that we may invert the signs of all φi to assure x2s + 1  ≥  0. Again it remains to prove only the transitivity of the action of G2s + 1 on vectors with equal γ,δ,x2s + 1. We will use the same algorithm for transformation to a canonical representative in each orbit with the following changes:

In these coordinates

Using repeatedly the modified Euclidean algorithm we may transform each vector to [formula]. Notice that up to now, there were used only transformations not involving σ1, which are exactly those, preserving the form J.

By definition gcd (γ',qs + 1) = γ which implies gcd (γ' + qs + 1,qs + 1) = γ. If l < s the repeating of Step 5 will end the procedure. If l = n the application of Vr will transform γ'  ↦  γ' + rqs + 1. We may take the minimal non-negative value of γ' for the canonical representative in this orbit.

Expressing

[formula]

we check whether for different l1  ≠  l2 may correspond the same invariant δ:

[formula]

Not only δ but also α remains constant during Steps 1-5 i.e. when σ1 doesn't act. As l1,l2 correspond to α1,α2  =  β1 + 1 and the action of σ1 on the canonical element changes α1  ↦  α2, it is clear, that the vectors with l1  ≠  l2,  δ1  =  δ2 belong to the same orbit of G2s + 1.

We return to the modular case

[formula]

The invariant δ may be defined only if [formula]. It presented an obstruction in the algorithm for the canonical representative in each orbit at the fifth step, when we obtained a congruence subgroup of index 2 in [formula], generated by U1,V1,Z1, whose action on 1,2 is given by the matrices

[formula]

If m is odd certain power of the last matrix will be [formula] so we have the full [formula].

Every finite orbit of Bn + 1 on the rank 2, (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) Gram matrices [\eqref=mod] is in one-to-one correspondence with the following quantities

Now we are able to describe the nature of the group Gn. First let us note the well-known fact that the group of permutations of n + 1 elements Sn + 1 can be represented by n + 1  ×  n + 1 matrices

[formula]

If we consider binary matrices over the field [formula] the permutations of n + 1 elements can also be represented by n  ×  n matrices

[formula]

which are non-degenerate and closed under multiplication

[formula]

Matrices of the transformations [\eqref=act] acting on [formula], correspond to the generating transpositions [formula] in the above representation of Sn + 1. This demonstrates an isomorphism between the matrices of Gn over [formula] and the group Sn + 1. We have seen that [formula]. Moreover [formula] and [formula]. The transformation

[formula]

intermixes the orbits with different δ and belongs to [formula] therefore when added to G2s will generate the whole [formula] (see [\cite=Sieg]).

In order to find the number of co-classes of G2s in [formula] it is enough to divide the number of elements in the last group over the field [formula] by that of the first:

[formula]

The group G2s + 1 preserve the coordinate x2s + 1 and in the corresponding basis its elements have the form

[formula]

The index of G2s + 1 in [formula] is

[formula]
