Tight Contact Small Seifert Spaces with [formula]

Introduction and Statements of Results

A contact structure ξ on an oriented 3-manifold M is a nowhere integrable tangent plane distribution, i.e., near any point of M, ξ is defined locally by a 1-form α, s.t., [formula]. Note that the orientation of M given by [formula] depends only on ξ, not on the choice of α. ξ is said to be positive if this orientation agrees with the native orientation of M, and negative if not. A contact structure ξ is said to be co-orientable if ξ is defined globally by a 1-form α. Clearly, an co-orientable contact structure is orientable as a plane distribution, and a choice of α determines an orientation of ξ. Unless otherwise specified, all contact structures in this paper will be co-oriented and positive, i.e., with a prescribed defining form α such that [formula]. A curve in M is said to be Legendrian if it is tangent to ξ everywhere. ξ is said to be overtwisted if there is an embedded disk D in M such that ∂D is Legendrian, but D is transversal to ξ along ∂D. A contact structure that is not overtwisted is called tight. Overtwisted contact structures are classified up to isotopy by Eliashberg in [\cite=E1]. Classifying tight contact structures up to isotopy is much more difficult. Such classifications are only known for very limited classes of 3-manifolds. (See, e.g., [\cite=E2], [\cite=E3], [\cite=EH], [\cite=Gh], [\cite=GS], [\cite=H1], [\cite=H2], [\cite=K].)

For a small Seifert space M = M(r1,r2,r3), define e0(M)  =  ⌊r1⌋  +  ⌊r2⌋  +  ⌊r3⌋, where ⌊x⌋ is the greatest integer not greater than x. e0(M) is an invariant of M, i.e., it does not depend on the choice of the representatives (r1,r2,r3).

For a rational number r > 0, there is a unique way to expand - r into a continued fraction

[formula]

where all aj's are integers, a0 =  - (⌊r⌋ + 1)  ≤   - 1, and aj  ≤   - 2 for [formula]. We denote by [formula] the right hand side of equation [\eqref=expansion].

The following are our main results.

Let [formula] be a small Seifert space, where pi and qi are integers, s.t., [formula], [formula] and g.c.d.(pi,qi) = 1. Assume that, for i = 1,2,3, [formula], where all a(i)j's are integers, [formula], and a(i)j  ≤   - 2 for [formula]. Then, up to isotopy, there are exactly [formula] tight contact structures on M. All these tight contact structures are constructed by Legendrian surgeries of (S3,ξst), and are therefore holomorphically fillable.

Let [formula] be a small Seifert space, where pi, qi and e0 are positive integers, s.t., pi > qi and g.c.d.(pi,qi) = 1. Assume that, for i = 1,2,3, [formula], where all b(i)j's are integers less than or equal to - 2. Then, up to isotopy, there are exactly [formula] tight contact structures on M. All these tight contact structures are constructed by Legendrian surgeries of (S3,ξst), and are therefore holomorphically fillable.

Clearly, Theorems [\ref=class-3] and [\ref=class+1] give complete classifications of tight contact structures on small Seifert spaces with e0  ≠  0, - 1, - 2.

Continued Fractions

In this section, we establish some properties of continued fractions, which will be used in the proofs of Theorems [\ref=class-3] and [\ref=class+1].

Let [formula] be real numbers such that a0  ≤   - 1, and aj  ≤   - 2 for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. Define {pj} and {qj} by

[formula]

[formula]

Then, for 1  ≤  j  ≤  m, we have

[formula],

pj  ≥  pj - 1 > 0, qj  ≥  qj - 1 > 0,

pjqj - 1 - pj - 1qj = 1,

[formula].

By the definitions of {pj} and {qj}, we have p0 = 1, q0 =  - a0, p1 =  - a1, and q1 = a0a1 - 1. Then it's easy to check that the lemma is true for j = 1. Assume that the lemma is true for [formula]. Then,

[formula]

Also, since qj - 1  ≥  qj - 2 > 0 and [formula], we have [formula], and, similarly, pj  ≥  pj - 1 > 0.

Furthermore, by definitions of {pj} and {qj},

[formula]

Finally,

[formula]

This shows that the lemma is also true for j.

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=class-3] and [\ref=class+1], all the aj's will be integers, and so will the corresponding pj's and qj's be. Then, property (3) in Lemma [\ref=CF] implies that g.c.d.(pj,qj) = 1.

The e0  ≤   - 3 Case

In the rest of this paper, we let Σ be a three hole sphere, and -  ∂Σ  ×  S1 = T1 + T2 + T3, where the "-  " sign means reversing the orientation. We identify Ti to [formula] by identifying the corresponding component of [formula] to (1,0)T, and [formula] to (0,1)T. Also, for i = 1,2,3, let Vi = D2  ×  S1, and identify ∂Vi with [formula] by identifying a meridian [formula] with (1,0)T and a longitude [formula] with (0,1)T.

Following Honda, we call a convex torus minimal if it has only two dividing curves.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=class-3]. Define {p(i)j} and {q(i)j} by

[formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=CF] and Remark [\ref=integer], we have pi = p(i)mi and qi = q(i)mi. Let ui = p(i)mi - 1 and vi = q(i)mi - 1. Then pi  ≥  ui > 0, qi  ≥  vi > 0, and pivi - qiui = 1.

Define an orientation preserving diffeomorphism φi:∂Vi  →  Ti by

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Let ξ be a tight contact structure on M. We first isotope ξ to make each Vi a standard neighborhood of a Legendrian circle Li isotopic to the i-th singular fiber with twisting number ti <  - 2, i.e., ∂Vi is convex with two dividing curves each of which has slope [formula] when measured in the coordinates of ∂Vi given above. Let si be the slope of the dividing curves of Ti  =  ∂Vi measured in the coordinates of Ti. Then we have that

[formula]

The fact ti <  - 2 implies that [formula].

After a possible slight isotopy supported in a neighborhood of Ti  =  ∂Vi, we assume that Ti has Legendrian ruling of slope ∞   when measured in the coordinates of Ti. For each i, pick a Legendrian ruling Li on Ti. Choose a convex vertical annulus A  ⊂  Σ  ×  S1, such that [formula], and the interior of A is contained in the interior of Σ  ×  S1. By Theorem 1.4 of [\cite=Wu], ξ does not admit Legendrian vertical circles with twisting number 0. So there must be dividing curves of A that connect the two boundary components of A. We isotope T1 and T2 by adding to them the bypasses corresponding to the ∂-parallel dividing curves of A. Since bypass adding is done in a small neighborhood of the bypass and the original surface, we can keep Vi's disjoint during this process. Also Ti remains minimal after each bypass adding. After we depleted all the ∂-parallel dividing curves of A, each of the remaining dividing curves connects the two boundary components of A. So the slopes of the dividing curves of T1 and T2 after the isotopy are [formula] and [formula], where [formula] and g.c.d.(k,ki) = 1 for i = 1,2. Since [formula], We have that, for i = 1,2, [formula], and, hence [formula]. This is because that, by Lemma 3.15 of [\cite=H1], [formula] implies s'i  =    ∞   which contradicts Theorem 1.4 of [\cite=Wu]. Now, cut M open along [formula] and round the edges. We get a convex torus isotopic to T3 with two dividing curves of slope [formula] when measure in the coordinates of T3. When measured in the coordinates of ∂V3, these dividing curves have slope [formula]. It's easy to check that [formula]. So, by Theorem 4.16 of [\cite=H1], we can isotope ∂V3 so that it has two dividing curves of slope [formula]. Measured in the coordinates of T3, the slope is 0. This implies that the maximal twisting number of a Legendrian vertical circle is - 1.

After an isotopy of ξ, we can find a Legendrian vertical circle L in the interior of Σ  ×  S1 with twisting number - 1, and, again, make each Vi a standard neighborhood of a Legendrian circle Li isotopic to the i-th singular fiber with twisting number ti <  - 2. As before, we can assume that Ti has Legendrian ruling of slope ∞   when measured in the coordinates of Ti. Let Li be a Legendrian ruling of Ti. For each i, we choose a convex vertical annulus Ai  ⊂  Σ  ×  S1, s.t., [formula], the interior of Ai is contained in the interior of Σ  ×  S1, and [formula] when i  ≠  j. Ai has no ∂-parallel dividing curves on the L side since t(L) is maximal. So the dividing set of Ai consists of two curves connecting L to Li and possibly some ∂-parallel curves on the Li side. We now isotope Ti by adding to it the bypasses corresponding to these ∂-parallel dividing curves, and keep Vi's disjoint in this process. After this isotopy, we get a convex decomposition

[formula]

of M, where each Ti has two dividing curves of slope [formula] when measured in the coordinate of Ti. When measured in coordinates of ∂Vi, the slope of the dividing curves becomes [formula].

By part (4) of Lemma 5.1 of [\cite=H2], there are exactly [formula] tight contact structures on Σ  ×  S1 satisfying the boundary condition and admitting no Legendrian vertical circles with twisting number 0. By Theorem 2.3 of [\cite=H1] and part (4) of Lemma [\ref=CF], there are exactly [formula] tight contact structures on Vi satisfying the boundary condition. Thus, up to isotopy, there are at most [formula] tight contact structures on M.

It remains to construct [formula] tight contact structures on M by Legendrian surgeries of (S3,ξst). We begin with the standard surgery diagram of [formula]. Then, for each i, perform an a(i)0-Rolfsen twist on the [formula]-component. Since a(1)0 + a(2)0 + a(3)0 = e0(M) and [formula], the new surgery coefficients of the four components are e0(M), [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Now, we perform (inverses of) the slam-dunks corresponding to the three continued fractions here, which lead us to the diagram at the bottom of Figure [\ref=surgery]. Since the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of an unknot in (S3,ξst) is - 1, there are [formula] ways to realize this diagram by Legendrian surgeries. According to Proposition 2.3 of [\cite=Go] and Theorem 1.2 of [\cite=LM], each of these Legendrian surgeries gives a non-isotopic tight contact structure on M. Thus, up to isotopy, there are exactly [formula] tight contact structures on M. [formula]

The [formula] Case

Following [\cite=Wu], we call a tight contact structure on Σ  ×  S1 appropriate is there are no embedded thickened tori in Σ  ×  S1 with I-twisting ≥  π and parallel to one of the boundary components.

The following lemma is a reformulation of parts (1), (2) and (3) of Lemma 5.1 of [\cite=H2].

Let ξ be an appropriate contact structure on Σ  ×  S1 with minimal convex boundary that admits a vertical Legendrian circle with twisting number 0. Assume that dividing curves of T1, T2 and T3 are of slopes - 1, - 1, - n, respectively, where n is an integer greater than 1. Then there is a factorization [formula], where Li's are embedded thickened tori with minimal twisting and minimal convex boundary ∂Li = T'i - Ti, s.t., dividing curves of T'i have slope ∞  . The appropriate contact structure ξ is uniquely determined by the signs of the basic slices L1, L2 and L3. The sign convention here is given by associating (0,1)T to T'i.

We only prove the last sentence. The rest is just part (1) of Lemma 5.1 of [\cite=H2]. Let Σ0 be a properly embedded three hole sphere in Σ  ×  S1 isotopic to Σ  ×  {pt}, and [formula]. We isotope Σ0 so that Σ0 and Σ'0 are convex with Legendrian boundaries that intersect the dividing curves of ∂Σ  ×  S1 and ∂Σ'  ×  S1 efficiently. Then each component of ∂Σ'0 intersects the dividing curves of Σ'0 twice. Since ξ is appropriate, Σ'0 has no ∂-parallel dividing curves. This implies that, up to isotopy relative to boundary and Dehn twists parallel to boundary components, there are only two configurations of dividing curves on Σ'0. (See Figure [\ref=inner].) Thus, there are only two tight contact structure on Σ'  ×  S1, up to isotopy relative to boundary and full horizontal rotations of each boundary component.

Let [formula]. Then the dividing set of each of A1 and A2 consists of two arcs connecting the two boundary components. And the dividing set of A3 consists of two arcs connecting the two boundary components and n - 1 ∂-parallel arcs on the T3 side. From the relative Euler class of ξ|L3, one can see that the half discs bounded by these ∂-parallel arcs must be pairwise disjoint and of the sign opposite to that of L3. By isotoping Σ0 relative to Σ'0, we can freely choose the holonomy of the non-∂-parallel dividing curves of each Ai. This implies that, up to isotopy relative to boundary, there are only two possible configurations of dividing curves on Σ0 when the signs of Li's are given. (See Figure [\ref=middle].)

When the signs of Li's are mixed, we can extend (∂Σ  ×  S1,ξ) to a universally tight contact manifold (∂Σ''  ×  S1,ξ'') by gluing to Ti a basic slice L''i of the same sign as Li for each i, where L''i has minimal convex boundary ∂L''i = Ti - T''i, and the dividing curves of T''i are vertical. Extend Σ0 across L''i to Σ''0 so that Σ''0 is convex with Legendrian boundary intersecting the dividing curves of T''i efficiently. For i = 1,2, the dividing set of [formula] consists of 1 ∂-parallel arcs on each boundary component. From the relative Euler class of ξ''|L''i, we can see that the half discs on [formula] bounded by these ∂-parallel arcs are of the same sign as the basic slice Li. The dividing set of [formula] consists of n ∂-parallel arcs on the T3 side and 1 ∂-parallel arcs on the T''3 side. From the relative Euler class of ξ''|L''3, we can see that the half discs on [formula] bounded by these ∂-parallel arcs are pairwise disjoint and of the same sign as the basic slice L3.

Now, one can see that, after the extension, the two possible configurations of dividing curves on Σ0 become the same minimal configuration of dividing curves on Σ''0. (See Figure [\ref=outer].) By Lemma 5.1 of [\cite=H2], the two configurations correspond to the same universally tight contact structure on Σ  ×  S1. This shows that, when the signs of Li's are mixed, ξ is uniquely determined by the signs of Li's. When all the Li's have the same sign, ξ is virtually overtwisted, and the isotopy type relative to boundary of such a contact structure is determined by the action of the relative Euler class on Σ0, which is, in turn, determined by the sign of L3. Thus, when all the Li's have the same sign, this common sign determines ξ.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=class+1]. Define {p(i)j} and {q(i)j} by

[formula]

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=CF] and Remark [\ref=integer], we have pi = p(i)li and qi = q(i)li. Let ui =  - p(i)li - 1 and vi =  - q(i)li - 1. Then pivi - qiui = 1.

Define an orientation preserving diffeomorphism φi:∂Vi  →  Ti by

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Let ξ be a tight contact structure on M. By Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=Wu], ξ admits a vertical Legendrian circle L with twisting number 0. We first isotope ξ so that there is a vertical Legendrian circle with twisting number 0 in the interior of Σ  ×  S1, and each Vi is a standard neighborhood of a Legendrian circle Li isotopic to the i-th singular fiber with twisting number ti < 0, i.e., ∂Vi is convex with two dividing curves each of which has slope [formula] when measured in the coordinates of ∂Vi given above. Let si be the slope of the dividing curves of Ti  =  ∂Vi measured in the coordinates of Ti. Then we have that

[formula]

We choose ti <  <  - 1 so that [formula] for i = 1,2, and [formula]. Using the vertical Legendrian circle L, we can thicken Vi to V'i, s.t., V'i's are pairwise disjoint, and T'i  =  ∂V'i is a minimal convex torus with vertical dividing curves when measured in coordinates of Ti. By Proposition 4.16 of [\cite=H1], there exits a minimal convex torus T''i in the interior of [formula] isotopic to Ti that has dividing curves of slope [formula] for i = 1,2, and [formula] for = 3. Let V''i be the solid torus bounded by T''i, and [formula].

Now we count the tight contact structures on Σ''  ×  S1 and V''i that satisfy the given boundary condition. First, we look at V''i. In the coordinates in ∂Vi, the dividing curves of T''i  =  ∂V''i have slope [formula]. By part (4) of Lemma [\ref=CF] and the definitions of ui, vi, we have that [formula]. Thus, on each V''i, there are [formula] tight contact structures that satisfy the given boundary condition. Then we look at Σ''  ×  S1. The thickened torus Li bounded by T'i - T''i is a continued fraction block consisting of |b(i)0 + 1| basic slices. Let L'i be the basic slice in Li closest to T'i, and ∂L'i = T'i - T'''i. Note that T'''i is a minimal convex torus with dividing curves of slope - 1 for i = 1,2, and - e0 - 1 for i = 3. Let [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=center], the tight contact structure on [formula] is uniquely determined by the signs of the basic slices L'i. But we can shuffle the signs of the basic slices within a continued fraction block. Let's shuffle all the positive signs in Li to the basic slices closest to T'i. Then the sign of L'i is uniquely determined by the number of positive slices in Li, and so is the number of positive slices in [formula]. Thus, the tight contact structures on [formula] and [formula] are uniquely determined by these three numbers. But there are only |b(1)0b(2)0b(3)0| ways to choose these three numbers. So there are at most |b(1)0b(2)0b(3)0| on Σ''  ×  S1 that satisfy the given boundary condition. Altogether, there are at most [formula] tight contact structures on M.

It remains to construct [formula] tight contact structures on M by Legendrian surgeries of (S3,ξst). We begin with the standard surgery diagram of [formula]. Then, perform a slum-dunk between the 0-component and the [formula]-component, after which the [formula]-component disappears and the original 0-component becomes a [formula]-component. Next we perform a ( - 1)-Rolfson twist on the [formula]-component, after which the three components remain trivial and have coefficients [formula], [formula] and [formula]. But we have

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where, on the right hand side of the last equation, there are e0 - 1 many - 2's in front of b(3)0 - 1. Now, we perform (inverses of) the slam-dunks corresponding to these three continued fractions here, which lead us to the diagram at the bottom of Figure [\ref=surgery2]. Note that all components in this diagram are trivial. Since the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of an unknot in (S3,ξst) is - 1, it's easy to see that there are [formula] ways to realize this diagram by Legendrian surgeries. According to Proposition 2.3 of [\cite=Go] and Theorem 1.2 of [\cite=LM], each of these Legendrian surgeries gives a non-isotopic tight contact structure on M. Thus, up to isotopy, there are exactly [formula] tight contact structures on M. [formula]
