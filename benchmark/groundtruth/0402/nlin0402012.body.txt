Introduction

Complex systems we meet in economics and finances are usually described by huge amounts of data, parameters and often have a non-predictable and chaotic behavior. To reveal interrelations among these parameters and data new methods of computer analysis have to be developed. These problems are of exceptional interest now when computer technologies provide enormous possibilities for collecting, storing and processing of information obtained by tracing system behavior. It is believed that this information is particularly important for the prediction of the system behavior. In this case researchers dealing with such types of systems often try to apply statistical [\cite=princ] [\cite=cox] or neurons methods [\cite=ref] [\cite=koh] for the discovery of new knowledge about the system. In framework of this approach self-adjustable methods known as self-organization methods [\cite=ref] [\cite=koh] [\cite=4] [\cite=1] [\cite=3] are especially interesting because they could be applied in autonomous regime without external setting for every particular case. In this article we use two types of self-organization methods for investigation of financial market behavior by analyzing data series of Dow Jones index. The study of the financial markets behavior is a very important and actual question because financial markets are described by inadequate prior information; they include many variables and are characterized by fuzzy elements. Therefore, market structures are extremely difficult for analytical description, and their dynamics is hard to predict.

Processing data by self-organizing methods

We investigate data time-series of Dow Jones index for the years 2002-2003. These data are presented in a table, each column of which contains information about corresponding stock price during each working day for the years 2002 and 2003 separately. Each line contains information about every day state of all indices. We use time-series of the prices for 27 companies drawing up Dow Jones index, which are calculated at the end of each working day.

For finding relationships in collective dynamics of prices we have normalized the input data

[formula]

where x'ji is non-normalized elements of input Table 1, xmaxi and xmini are maximal and minimal non-normalized elements of i-column, respectively. In order to reveal some structures in stock market behavior for the companies under consideration we apply SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) [\cite=4] [\cite=5] and GMDH (Group Method of Data Handling) algorithms [\cite=1] [\cite=7] and compare these results.

The SOM is an unsupervised-learning neural-network method that provides a similarity graph of input data. It represents obtained results in a very convenient way. A typical simplified version of the SOM algorithm consists of two steps iterated for every sample [\cite=4]: a) finding the best matching units; b) adaptation of the weights. Initially all neuron weights are initialized by uniform distribution on the interval

[formula]

The GMDH analysis

Dynamics of collective stock market behavior can be analyzed by methods of multiple regression [\cite=2]. But these methods take into account the whole set of input data and overload the final model (equation of regression). Self-organizing algorithms do not have this disadvantage. Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) creates the model that includes only the most influential variables [\cite=3] [\cite=7]. The GMDH algorithms are based on a sorting-out procedure of model simulation and provide the best model according to the criterion given by the researcher. This model describes relations between their elements and the state of the whole system. Most of GMDH algorithms use polynomial referenced functions. General connections between input and output variables can be shown by Volterra functional series. A discrete analogue of Volterra series is Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial

[formula]

where y - output variable vector, (x1,x2,...,xN) - input data, (a1,...,aN,...,aij,...,aijk,...) - vector of coefficients or weights. Input data might consist of independent variables, functional expressions or finite residues. The key feature of GMDH algorithms is a partition of input data into two subsets. The first one is used to compute coefficients of the polynomial using the list square technique and to evaluate internal error by some criterion. The second one is used to calculate external error using information, which is not applied for the coefficients computations. Principles of self-organization manifest themselves in rationalization of optimal polynomial search. Internal criterion monotonously decreases when complexity of polynomials increases, simultaneously external criterion passes its minimum. Then it is possible to choose polynomial of optimal complexity, which is unique for this criterion. In other words, we provide sorting-out procedure for partial polynomials to find polynomial of optimal complexity (optimal model). It shows the dependence of the output variable on the most influential variables, which are chosen from all input variables. External criterion reaches its minimum on optimal model. Interpretation of the results is similar to multiple regression logic: the bigger is the coefficient - the more influential is the variable near it.

The combinatorial algorithm was used for providing complete search between all possible polynomials of the first order [\cite=7]. The peculiarity of this algorithm comprises gradual change of candidate polynomials. In this case the number of variables gradually increases from 1 to N. For our investigation we use unbiased criterion and variation criterion [\cite=1].

The complete set of polynomials includes k = 227 - 1 models and the computations require a lot of time. Thus, we take into account the elements of the certain cluster and its neighbors created by SOM algorithm (Fig.1). Therefore, it makes it possible to analyze bigger set of elements relationships and obtain certain hierarchy, to find the most influential variables in each cluster.

We estimated that for each cluster fewer a 15 vectors might play a role in stock behavior. As a rule, the obtained polynomials of different complexity correspond to the results presented by SOM. The number of the dependent variables in the models varies from 3 to 8. In some cases GMDH models describe relationships among elements of one cluster. For example, relationships among companies S, MCD and MO are not evident beforehand. Analytical expression for such relationships is

[formula]

Considering relationships between elements of the cluster I, which was described above, one obtains the following model

[formula]

It is easy to see that the model includes only three elements of the cluster. It was not evident that relationships between these three companies don't depend on the stock behavior of the other companies drawing up Dow Jones index. In the most cases the relationships we obtain have bigger numbers of elements, some of which have large coefficients.

It should be noted that the relationships between companies obtained by this method are not reciprocal. Being bounded by the equation some companies more sufficiently influence the stock price dynamics of others than those of their own. For example, we consider cluster III, which includes UN, MMM and PG (Fig.2). The obtained models are

[formula]

and

[formula]

These equations show that relationships between elements of cluster III are essential. In particular, the dynamics of YPG depends on the dynamics of XMMM and vice versa. In the same time YPG also depends on the dynamics of XAXP and XT, but YMMM depends on the dynamics of other indices, such as XKO,  XMO.

We found that the relationships between prices dynamics of the companies are very robust. Let us consider an example describing dynamics of cluster I.

[formula]

Easy to see that XGT is the most influential element for YAA. The price XCAT has less weight than other prices. Eliminating from consideration XGT and leaving other elements we obtain a new model, which has a new set of elements. But XCAT belongs to both models and has the biggest weight in a new expression.

[formula]

The same procedure could be applied to the data for the year 2003 and makes it possible to find analytical expressions for the stock market behavior of any company drawing up Dow Jones index. We do not display these results in order to restrict the volume of the paper. In addition, this investigation has a particular interest for people dealing with specific finance investigation.

Conclusions

The results obtained by SOM algorithm are sufficiently demonstrative and make it possible to understand deep relationships inherent to such a complex system like stock market. The GMDH algorithm, in its turn, makes it possible to establish analytical dependence of the stock prices of the companies, which have correlated behavior. The introduced self-organizing methods complement each other. The obtained results are self-consistent and allow to find an optimal non-overloaded model, which is easy for economic interpretation. Using the combination of such methods promises to be very perspective.
