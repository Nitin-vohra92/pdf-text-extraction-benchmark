The Instanton Molecule Liquid and "Sticky Molasses" Above TC

The concept that hadronic states may survive in the high temperature phase of QCD, the quark-gluon plasma [\cite=BLRS], has been known for some time. In particular, it was explored by Brown et al.[\cite=BBP91] [\cite=BJBP93]. The properties of (degenerate) π and σ resonances above Tc in the context of the NJL model was discussed earlier by Hatsuda and Kunihiro[\cite=Hatsuda_sigma], and in the instanton liquid model by Schafer and Shuryak [\cite=SS_survive]. Recently, lattice calculations [\cite=datta02] [\cite=hatsuda2003] have shown that, contrary to the original suggestion by Matsui and Satz [\cite=MS], the lowest charmonium states J / ψ,ηc remain bound well above Tc. The estimates of the zero binding temperature for charmonium TJ / ψ is now limited to the interval 2Tc  >  TJ / ψ  >  1.6Tc, where Tc  ≈  270  MeV is that for quenched QCD. Similar results for light quark mesons exist but are less quantitative at the moment. However since the "quasiparticle" masses close to Tc are large, they must be similar to those for charmonium states.

In the chiral limit all states above the chiral restoration go into chiral multiplets. For quark quasiparticles this is also true, but although the chirality is conserved during their propagation, they are not massless and move slowly near Tc where their "chiral mass" m = E(p  →  0) is large (~  1 GeV).

RHIC experiments have found that hot/dense matter at temperatures above the critical value Tc  ≈  170  MeV is not a weakly interacting gas of quasiparticles, as was widely expected. Instead, RHIC data have demonstrated the existence of very robust collective flow phenomena, well described by ideal hydrodynamics. Most decisive in reaching this conclusion was the early measurement of the elliptic flow which showed that equilibration in the new state of matter above Tc set in in a time <  1 fm/c [\cite=hydro2001] [\cite=kolb]. Furthermore, the first viscosity estimates [\cite=Teaney2003] show surprisingly low values, suggesting that this matter is the most perfect liquid known. Indeed, the ratio of shear viscosity coefficient to the entropy is only η / s  ~  0.1, two orders of magnitude less than for water. Furthermore, it is comparable to predictions in the infinite coupling limit (for N=4 SUSY YM theory) η / s  =  1 / 4π [\cite=PSS], perhaps the lowest value possible.

Shuryak and Zahed[\cite=shuryak2003] have recently connected these two issues together. They have suggested that large rescattering cross sections apparently present in hot matter at RHIC are generated by resonances near the zero-binding lines. Indeed, at the point of zero binding the scattering length a of the two constituents goes to ∞   and this provides low viscosity. This phenomenon is analogous to the elliptic flow observed in the expansion of trapped 6Li atoms rendered possible by tuning the scattering length to very large values via a Feshbach resonance [\cite=Li6] [\cite=Bourel].

Near the zero-binding points, to be denoted by Tzb, introduced by Shuryak and Zahed[\cite=shuryak2003] the binding is small and thus the description of the system can be simple and nonrelativistic. The binding comes about chiefly from the attractive Coulomb color electric field, as evidenced in lattice gauge calculation of Karsch and collaborators[\cite=datta02] [\cite=petreczky02], and Asakawa and Hatsuda[\cite=hatsuda2003]. The instanton molecule interactions are less important at these high temperatures (T  ~  400 MeV).

In this work we wish to construct the link between the chirally broken state of hadronic matter below Tc and the chirally restored mesonic, glueball state above Tc. Our objective is to understand and to work out in detail what exactly happens with hadronic states at temperatures between Tc and Tzb. One important new point is that these chirally restored hadrons are so small that the color charges are locked into the hadrons at such short distances (<  0.5 fm) that the Debye screening is unimportant. This is strictly true at [formula], where there is very little free charge. In this temperature range the nonrelativistic treatment of Shuryak and Zahed[\cite=shuryak2003] should be changed to a relativistic one.

The relativistic current-current interaction, ultimately related with the classical Ampere law, is about as important as the Coulomb one, effectively doubling the attraction. We also found that the spin-spin forces [\cite=BLRS] are truly negligible. In effect, with the help of the instanton molecule interaction, one can get the bound quark-antiquark states down in energy, reaching the massless σ and π at Tc, so that a smooth transition can be made with the chiral breaking at T < Tc.

The non-pertubative interaction from the instanton molecules becomes very important. Let us remind the reader of the history of the issue. The nonperturbative gluon condensate, contributing to the dilatational charge or trace of the stress tensor Tμμ  =  ε - 3p, is not melted at Tc. In fact more than half of the vacuum gluon condensate value remains at T right above Tc. the hard glue or epoxy which explicitly breaks scale invariance but is unconnected with hadronic masses. The rate at which the epoxy is melted can be measured by lattice gauge simulations, and this tells us the rate at which the instanton molecules are broken up with increasing temperature.

As argued by Ilgenfritz and Shuryak [\cite=IS], this phenomenon can be explained by breaking of the instanton ensemble into instanton molecules with zero topological charge. Such molecules generate a new form of effective multi-fermion effective interaction similar to the orignal NJL model[\cite=BLRS]. Brown et al.[\cite=bglr2003] obtained the interaction induced by the instanton molecules above Tc by continuing the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description from below Tc upwards.

Our present discussion of mesonic bound states should not be confused with quasi-hadronic states found in early lattice calculations[\cite=detar85] for quarks and antiquarks propagating in the space-like direction. Their spectrum, known as "screening masses" is generated mostly by "dynamical confinement" of the spatial Wilson loop which is a nonperturbative phenomenon seen via the lattice calculations. Similar effects will be given here by the instanton molecule interaction.

In this work we are able to construct a smooth transition from the chirally broken to the chirally restored sector in terms of continuity in the masses of the σ and π mesons, vanishing at T  →  Tc. The crucial part of strong binding in our picture of q mesons (or molecules) is the quasi-local interaction due to instanton molecules (the "hard glue"). We found that the tight binding of these mesons near Tc enhences the wave function at the origin, and gives us additional understanding of the nonperturbative hard glue (epoxy) which is preserved at T > Tc.

In our Nambu-Jona Lasinio formalism we construct giant collective vibrations with an essentially SU(4) structure. There giant vibrations were found in lattice calculations by by Asakawa et al.[\cite=asakawa03] at two temperatures. The lower temperature was in the region of the Shuryak-Zahed Tzb, and confirmed that the binding energy was very small. The higher temperature was at ~  500 MeV, above those reached by RHIC, and the lattice calculations suggested perturbative quasiparticles, indicating production of the QGP at this temperature.
