Electronic Detection of Gravitational Disturbances and Collective Coulomb Interactions

Introduction

Resonant acoustic modes in massive metallic bars have long been used as a probe for detecting possible gravitational wave sources. The interaction of gravitational waves with such antennae was thought by many to be dominated by the heavy nuclear masses within the metal. The interaction with the lighter electron masses was considered to be negligible. This view is valid only for static Newtonian gravity, which couples to the mass density . We have recently shown[\cite=us] that gravitational waves couple into the pressure tensor , and the pressure is dominated by electronic motions. Thus, the electronic coupling to the gravitational wave cannot be ignored.

The condensed matter Hamiltonian required to understand the coupling of the electrons to the gravitational wave is the sum of kinetic energies of the electrons and the nuclei plus the Coulomb interactions between all of the charged particles. Some standard models of the solid state which employ free electron and free phonon gases together with a weak electron-phonon interaction are inadequate[\cite=them] for the description of electron-graviton interactions since terms leading to highly excited virtual electronic states have been incorrectly thrown away. For example, the electron-electron Coulomb interactions[\cite=elel] are not considered in the usual electron-phonon interaction model. Model Hamiltonians are considered in Sec.[\ref=CM]. From the Hamiltonian one can compute the pressure tensor which determines the interaction between the gravity wave and the antenna. The exact result is then the kinetic pressure plus the Maxwell field pressure. The Coulomb terms in the Maxwell stress tensor are crucially important for understanding the mutual interactions between electrons, phonons and gravitons as discussed in Sec.[\ref=GI]. In Sec.([\ref=absorb]) the rigorous expression for the single graviton absorption cross section is exhibited and shown to be expressed directly and rigorously in terms of the non-local viscosity of the crystal. Since the electrons dominate the viscosity, they also dominate the absorption cross section.

Condensed Matter

The metal bar may be described by a Hamiltonian which consists of the kinetic energy of the nuclei and the kinetic energy of the electrons all interacting with the Coulomb law ,

[formula]

The pressure implied by Eq.([\ref=CoulombUs]) is dominated by the electronic motions rather than the nuclear motions so that the electronic coupling to the gravitational wave becomes crucial for determining the detection efficiency. We have found that the efficiency induced by including the electronic coupling to gravity is considerably enhanced above the efficiency found by including only the nuclear coupling to gravity.

The considerations above have been recently criticized[\cite=them]. The microscopic Hamiltonian employed[\cite=them] for the crystal is a standard electron-phonon approximation[\cite=abgd] to our Hamiltonian Eq.([\ref=CoulombUs]) given (in first quantized notation) as

[formula]

or in second quantized notation

[formula]

Starting from the exact Coulomb Hamiltonian one may derive the low energy effective Hamiltonian only by employing a sequence of approximations[\cite=el_ph]: (i) The electron-electron Coulomb interactions are ignored. (ii) Phonon modes are derived in the adiabatic approximation. (iii) The non-adiabatic excitation interaction matrix Hamiltonian is replaced by a local electron deformation potential . These three approximations make the effective Hamiltonian inadequate for discussing the gravitational wave interaction. In our work[\cite=us] we avoided these three approximations by employing rigorously exact sum rules. Any other work[\cite=them] which starts from the antenna Hamiltonian is bound to miss the electronic-gravitational enhanced efficiency because of an inadequate approximation in the Hamiltonian from which the computation begins.

Pressure and Gravitational Interactions

For a small gravitational wave strain described by the space-time metric

[formula]

the interaction between the gravitational wave and condensed matter is described by

[formula]

wherein is the pressure tensor of the condensed matter. For the exact Coulomb Hamiltonian the pressure tensor is given by the sum of the kinetic pressure and the Maxwell field pressure[\cite=Pauli]

[formula]

The electron and nuclear momenta will be denoted, respectively by and . Spatial indices will be denoted by which may be . The kinetic pressure tensor

[formula]

and the Maxwell field pressure

[formula]

wherein the electric fields due to an electron or a nucleus are given, respectively, by

[formula]

Employing the approximate Hamiltonian in Eq.([\ref=ApproxThem]), Branchina et. al.[\cite=them] imply a pressure (via the linear Hamiltonian coupling in ) which is much simpler than the rigorous Eqs.([\ref=pressure1]), ([\ref=pressure2]) and ([\ref=pressure3]) of our work; i.e.

[formula]

The simplicity of the above approximate compared with the exact arises because so very many of the terms in the Maxwell pressure tensor Eq.([\ref=pressure3]) have been simply thrown away. For example, all Coulomb electric field interactions between electrons have been ignored.

To see what is involved, consider a process in which a graviton with energy is absorbed by an antenna producing a phonon with energy ; i.e.

[formula]

With the exact Coulomb Pressure of Eqs.([\ref=pressure1])-([\ref=pressure3]), but not with the approximate pressure of Eq.([\ref=pressure4]), an electronic process can occur with an intermediate electron-hole pair state

[formula]

as shown in Fig.([\ref=FIG1]).

For example, with the help of the full Maxwell stress tensor one computes the pressure matrix elements including highly excited virtual non-adiabatic excited states,

[formula]

in which the electron pressure included in () also has a similar structure for the intermediate states.

Viscosity

In an infinite medium, the linear approximation to the Einstein field equation is

[formula]

The transverse traceless part of the pressure is related to the strain by the constitutive relation

[formula]

wherein is a Lam√© elastic constant and is the crystal viscosity. The gravitational wave then travels through the elastic media as described by the wave equation

[formula]

The energy in the wave attenuates at rate (per unit time) as determined by Eq.([\ref=absorb3]). The absorption rate is completely determined by the viscosity via

[formula]

as has been proved in previous work[\cite=viscosity].

For a finite size medium, such as a gravitational wave antenna, the rigorously exact result for a graviton to be absorbed at temperature is determined by the non-local viscosity. With , the microscopic Green-Kubo formula for viscosity is

[formula]

Theorem:

There can be no difference of opinion as to whether the quantum pressure fluctuations producing the viscosity in Eq.([\ref=absorb5]) determines the total graviton cross section as in Eq.([\ref=absorb6]). That the electrons dominate the viscosity in low temperature metals has been experimentally well established[\cite=el_vis1]. Since the cross section for the absorption of gravity waves is rigorously determined by the viscosity response function, it is then evident that electrons dominate over the nuclear motions with regard to gravity wave absorption.

Conclusion

The gravitational wave is absorbed by an antenna via the quantum fluctuations in the pressure, which describe the viscous response function. In a metallic antenna, the electronic motions control the pressure and thereby control the viscosity. The electronic nature of viscous electronic damping of sound has been experimentally verified. Since viscosity also damps gravitational waves, it seem natural that electronic motions should play a key role for gravitational wave detection.

To understand the importance of electronic-gravitational wave interactions from a microscopic viewpoint, one must keep the correct virial theorem pressure contributions for both the Coulomb energy and kinetic energy. These contributions have been correctly computed in previously discussed viscosity sum rules[\cite=us]. The sum rules dictate that the full inclusion of the Coulomb interactions be present in an adequate microscopic theory. An inadequate model of pressure matrix elements consists of electrons and phonons as two ideal gas components weakly interacting with one another. In such weakly coupled electron-phonon models, the electronic Coulomb interactions are ignored, removing the strongly non-adiabatic matrix elements required for proper strength of electron-hole virtual excitations.

Finally, if the Coulomb interactions are properly included, then the electronic enhancement of the gravitational wave detection efficiency is theoretically substantial.
