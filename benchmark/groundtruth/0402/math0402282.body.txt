Complete curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds

Introduction

Consider a triple U: = (V,g,A) where g is a non-degenerate inner product of signature (p,q) on an m-dimensional real vector space V with m = p + q and where [formula] is an algebraic curvature tensor - i.e. a 4-tensor satisfying the usual symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor:

[formula]

We also consider a pair M: = (M,gM) where gM is a pseudo-Riemannian metric of signature (p,q) on a manifold M of dimension m = p + q. One says M is Riemannian if p = 0 and Lorentzian if p = 1. Let RM be the associated Riemann curvature tensor. We say that U is a 0-model for M if for every point P∈M, there exists an isomorphism ΦP:TPM  →  V so that

[formula]

One says that M is curvature homogeneous if M admits a 0-model, in other words, the metric and curvature tensor "look the same at each point". If N: = (N,gN) is a homogeneous space, we say that M is modelled on N if (TQN,hN|TQN,RN|TQN) is a 0-model for (M,gM,RM); the precise Q∈N being immaterial since N is assumed to be homogeneous. We refer to [\cite=KTV92] [\cite=T88] [\cite=Va91] for further details.

We say that [formula] is an algebraic covariant derivative curvature tensor if A1 has the curvature symmetries of the covariant derivative of the Riemann curvature tensor, i.e. we have the relations:

[formula]

We say that a quadruple U1: = (V,g,A,A1) is a 1-model for M if for every point P∈M, there exists an isomorphism ΦP:TPM  →  V so that

[formula]

In this setting, M is said to be 1-curvature homogeneous. The notion of k-curvature homogeneous for [formula] is defined similarly. These notions were first introduced by Singer who showed:

(Singer [\cite=S60]) There exists an universal bound km such that a Riemannian manifold M of dimension m is locally homogeneous if and only if M is (km + 1)-curvature homogeneous. Furthermore, km is smaller than m(m - 1) / 2.

One has the following important results in the context of models based on the curvature tensors of irreducible symmetric spaces in the Riemannian and Lorentzian setting:

(Tricerri and Vanhecke [\cite=TV]) A Riemannian curvature homogeneous manifold modelled on an irreducible symmetric space is locally symmetric.

(Cahen, Leroy, Parker, Tricerri, and Vanhecke [\cite=CLPT90]) A Lorentzian curvature homogeneous manifold modelled on an irreducible symmetric space has constant sectional curvature.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.2] (1) uses properties of the scalar curvature invariants of Riemannian manifolds which do not hold for indefinite metrics; the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.2] (2) uses the remark, which is based on M. Berger's classification, that any irreducible Lorentzian symmetric space of dimension greater than or equal to 3 has constant sectional curvature. In this brief note, we will present several examples illustrating that Theorem [\ref=thm-1.2] fails in the higher signature setting by constructing complete curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds which are modelled on irreducible symmetric spaces and which are not locally homogeneous.

Throughout this paper, we will be introducing metrics, curvature tensors, and covariant derivative curvature tensors. In the interests of brevity, we shall often only give the non-zero components of these tensors up to the usual [formula] symmetries.

Signature (p,p)

There are curvature homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of balanced (or neutral) signature (p,p) which are complete but not locally homogeneous (and hence not locally symmetric), but which nevertheless are modeled on a complete irreducible symmetric space.

Let [formula]. Let [formula] for [formula] and [formula] be coordinates on [formula]. Let [formula] be a smooth function on [formula]. Let [formula] where

[formula]

the other components being zero. Let [formula]. Let [formula] where

[formula]

The metric g1,p,f and the inner product g1,p have signature (p,p).

Let Hf = (Hf,ij), where Hf,ij: = (∂xi∂xjf), be the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives. Assume Hf > 0. Let Hijf be the inverse matrix. Let R1,p,f be the curvature tensor of the metric g1,p,f and let [formula] be the associated covariant derivative. Set

[formula]

Let [formula] and let Hf > 0. Then:

All geodesics in M1,p,f extend for infinite time.

If [formula], then [formula] is a diffeomorphism.

The non-zero components of R1,p,f and of [formula] are given by:

R1,p,f(∂xi,∂xj,∂xk,∂xl) = Hf,ilHf,jk - Hf,ikHf,jl,

[formula].

U1,p is an irreducible 0-model for M1,p,f.

If f = x21 + ... + x2p, then M1,p,f is an irreducible symmetric space.

If [formula] and if α1 is not constant, M1,p,f is not curvature 1-homogeneous.

The pseudo-Riemannian manifold M1,p,f can be realized as a hypersurface in a flat space of signature (p,p + 1); the Hessian Hf then gives the second fundamental form. We refer to [\cite=refDG] [\cite=GIZ02] [\cite=GIZ03] for further details concerning this family of manifolds.

Signature (2s,s)

For [formula], let [formula] give coordinates on [formula] where we have [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Let [formula] be smooth functions. Set

[formula]

Let [formula] where

[formula]

Manifolds of this type were first introduced in [\cite=GN03x]; see also [\cite=GN03] [\cite=GNV03].

Let [formula]. Let [formula] for

[formula]

The metric g2,s,F and the inner product g2,s have signature (2s,s). Set

[formula]

Let [formula]. Then:

All geodesics in M2,s,F extend for infinite time.

If [formula], then [formula] is a diffeomorphism.

The non-zero components of R2,s,F and of [formula] are given by:

R2,s,F(∂ui,∂uj,∂uj,∂ui) = (∂ui)2fi + (∂uj)2fj + |u|2,

R2,s,F(∂ui,∂uj,∂uj,∂ti) = 1,

[formula].

U2,s is an irreducible 0-model for M2,s,F.

If [formula], then M2,s,F is an irreducible symmetric space.

If [formula] and if α2 is not constant, M2,s,F is not curvature 1-homogeneous.

Assertion (6) in Theorem [\ref=thm-1.4] was discussed previously in [\cite=GN03]; C. Dunn pointed out that the argument given there contained a mistake. In this paper, we shall give a slightly different argument which avoids that mistake.

Manifolds which are 1-curvature homogeneous

The previous two families of examples were curvature homogeneous but not 1-curvature homogeneous for generic members of the families. Let [formula]. Introduce coordinates [formula] on [formula] where we have [formula] and [formula]. Let [formula]. Let [formula] where

[formula]

These manifolds are closely related to examples of Fiedler et al [\cite=refFeGi03].

Let [formula]. Let [formula] for

[formula]

The metric g3,r,ψ and the inner product g3,r have signature (r + 1,r + 1). We also define a 1-model space [formula] where

[formula]

Let [formula]. Assume that [formula]. Then:

All geodesics in M3,r,ψ extend for infinite time.

[formula] is a diffeomorphism for all P in [formula].

The non-zero components of R3,r,ψ and of [formula] are given by:

[formula],

R3,r,ψ(∂x,∂ui,∂vi + 1,∂x) = 1 for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1,

[formula].

U3,r is an irreducible 0-model for M3,r,ψ.

If ψ(ur) = u2r, then M3,r,ψ is an irreducible symmetric space.

If [formula], then:

U13,r is a 1-model for M3,r,ψ,

M3,r,ψ is not 2-curvature homogeneous.

Theorem [\ref=thm-1.3] (6) (resp. Theorem [\ref=thm-1.4] (6)) requires that [formula] (resp. [formula]). This result is sharp; for suitably chosen f (resp. F), M1,2,f (resp. M2,2,F) is curvature 1-homogeneous but not curvature 2-homogeneous; we omit details in the interests of brevity.

Osserman manifolds

If x is a tangent vector at a point P∈M, then the Jacobi operator JM(x) is characterized by the identity

[formula]

If ρM is the associated Ricci tensor, then [formula]. One says that M is spacelike (resp. timelike) Osserman if the eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator are constant on the pseudo-sphere bundle S+(M) of spacelike (resp. S-(M) of timelike) unit vectors. One says that M is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Osserman if the Jordan normal form of the Jacobi operator is constant on S+(M) (resp. S-(M)). We shall say that M is Osserman nilpotent of order n if JM(x)n = 0 for every x∈TM and if there exists a point P0∈M and a tangent vector x0∈TP0M so that [formula]. Such manifolds are necessarily Osserman since 0 is the only eigenvalue of JM. And consequently such manifolds are Ricci flat since [formula]. We refer to [\cite=GKV02] [\cite=refGi02] for further details concerning Osserman manifolds.

Let [formula]. If Hf > 0, then M1,p,f is spacelike and timelike Jordan Osserman.

Let [formula]. Then M2,s,F is spacelike Jordan Osserman. However M2,s,F is not timelike Jordan Osserman.

Let [formula]. If [formula], then M3,r,ψ is 2r-Osserman nilpotent.

The three families Mi,k first arose in the study of Osserman manifolds. We refer to [\cite=BBGR97] [\cite=BV03] [\cite=GKV02] [\cite=GVV98] for other examples of non-homogeneous Osserman manifolds.

Ivanov-Petrova manifolds

Let {e1,e2} be an oriented orthonormal basis for an oriented spacelike (resp. timelike) 2-plane π. The skew-symmetric curvature operator RM(π) is characterized by the identity

[formula]

This operator is independent of the particular oriented orthonormal basis chosen for π. One says that M is spacelike (resp. timelike) Jordan Ivanov-Petrova if the Jordan normal form of RM is constant on the Grassmannian of oriented spacelike (resp. timelike) 2-planes; one lets the Rank be the common value of [formula] in this setting.

Let [formula]. If Hf > 0, then M1,p,f is spacelike and timelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova of rank 2.

Let [formula]. Then M2,s,F is spacelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova of rank 4; M2,s,F is not timelike Jordan Ivanov-Petrova.

The geodesic involution

The following observation is a special case which follows from work of E. Cartan; we present it for the sake of completeness in light of the examples given above.

Let M be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p,q). Suppose that [formula] and that exp P:TPM  →  M is a diffeomorphism for every P∈M. Then the geodesic symmetry SP:Q  →   exp P{  -   exp - 1PQ} is an isometry. Furthermore, M is a homogeneous space.

Here is a brief guide to this paper. In Section [\ref=sect-2], we prove Assertions (1)-(3) of Theorems [\ref=thm-1.3]-[\ref=thm-1.5]. In Section [\ref=sect-3], we show Ui,k is a 0-model for Mi,k and in Section [\ref=sect-4], we show these models are irreducible. This establishes Assertion (4) of Theorems [\ref=thm-1.3]-[\ref=thm-1.5]. Assertion (5) of these three Theorems then follows as a scholium to the previous assertions. In Section [\ref=sect-5], we establish Assertion (6) of Theorems [\ref=thm-1.3]-[\ref=thm-1.5]. We refer to [\cite=GIZ03] for the proof of Assertion (1) of Theorems [\ref=thm-1.6] and [\ref=thm-1.7] and to [\cite=GN03] [\cite=GNV03] for the proof of Assertion (2) of Theorems [\ref=thm-1.6] and [\ref=thm-1.7]. Assertion (3) of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.6] is proved in Section [\ref=sect-4]. In Section [\ref=sect-6], we complete our discussion by proving Theorem [\ref=thm-1.8].

It is a pleasant task to thank Professors E. García-Río, O. Kowalski, and L. Vanhecke for useful conversations on this subject.

Complete manifolds

We shall need the following technical fact.

Let (z1,...,zn) be coordinates on [formula]. Let g be a pseudo-Riemannian metric on [formula] so that [formula]. Then:

[formula] is a complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

[formula] is a diffeomorphism for all P in [formula].

Let γ(t) = (z1(t),...,zn(t)) be a curve in [formula]; γ is a geodesic if and only

[formula]

We solve this system of equations recursively. Let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

Then [formula] while [formula]. Thus every geodesic arises in this way so all geodesics extend for infinite time. Furthermore, given [formula], there is a unique geodesic γ  =  γP,Q so that γ(0) = P and γ(1) = Q where

[formula]

This shows that exp P is a diffeomorphism from [formula] to [formula].

Adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.1]. Let

[formula]

The non-zero Christoffel symbols are

[formula]

We verify that the hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=lem-2.1] is satisfied and thereby prove Assertions (1) and (2) by setting:

[formula]

Furthermore, by Equation ([\ref=eqn-2.a]),

[formula]

while R1,p,f(  ·  ,  ·  ,  ·  ,  ·  ) = 0 if any of the entries is ∂yi. Assertion (3a) now follows. Furthermore, by Equation ([\ref=eqn-2.a]),

[formula]

while [formula] if any of the entries is ∂yi. This proves Assertion (3b) of Theorem [\ref=thm-1.3].

Adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.2]. Let i  ≠  j and let g = g2,s,F. The non-zero Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:

[formula]

We may then raise indices to see the non-zero covariant derivatives are given by:

[formula]

We derive Assertions (1) and (2) from Lemma [\ref=lem-2.1] by setting:

[formula]

We have [formula]. Thus if at least one zμ∈{∂vi}, then R2,s,F(z1,z2,z3,z4) = 0. Similarly, if at least two of the zμ belong to {∂ti}, then R2,s,F(z1,z2,z3,z4) = 0. Finally, as ∂ui∂ujF = 0 for i  ≠  j, [formula] if the indices {i,j,k} are distinct. Furthermore

[formula]

Assertions (3a) and (3b) now follow.

We have similarly that [formula] if at least one of the ξi belongs to [formula]. Furthermore, the only non-zero component of [formula] is given by:

[formula]

Assertion (3c) now follows.

Adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.3]. Let 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1 and let g = g3,r,ψ. We compute that the non-zero Christoffel symbols of the second kind are

[formula]

Consequently the non-zero Christoffel symbols of the first kind are

[formula]

To apply Lemma [\ref=lem-2.1], we set

[formula]

Assertions (1) and (2) follow. We have

[formula]

Assertions (3a) and (3b) follow. Assertion (3c) follows from these calculations and from Equation ([\ref=eqn-2.b]).

Model Spaces

Throughout this section, we shall only list (possibly) non-zero entries of g, Rg, and of [formula] up to the usual [formula] symmetries. We show U is a 0-model for M by exhibiting a basis for TPM with the required normalizations for any P∈M.

A 0-model for M1,p,f

Choose a basis {X1,...,Xp} for [formula] in TPM so that Hf(Xi,Xj) = δij. Expand [formula] and let ξij be the inverse matrix. Set [formula]. Then

[formula]

where cij = cji. Set [formula] and i: = Yi. We may then conclude U1,p is a 0-model for M1,p,f since

[formula]

A 0-model for M2,s,F

Fix [formula]. Define a new basis for TPM by setting:

[formula]

where the constants εi and ϱi will be specified below. Let i  ≠  j. Then:

[formula]

We set

[formula]

As g2,s,F(Ui,Ui) = R2,s,F(Ui,Uj,Uj,Ui) = 0, U2,s is a 0-model for M2,s,F.

A 0-model for M3,r,ψ

Let εi be real parameters to be specified below. Define a new basis {X,Y,U1,...,Ur,V1,...,Vr} for [formula] by setting:

[formula]

The non-zero entries in g3,r,ψ are given by g3,r,ψ(X,Y) = 1 and g3,r,ψ(Ui,Vi) = 1. We apply Theorem [\ref=thm-1.5] (3) to see the non-zero entries in R3,r,ψ and [formula] are

[formula]

Assume [formula]. We can show that U3,r is a 0-model for M3,r,ψ by setting:

[formula]

If in addition we suppose that [formula], then more is true. We show U13,ris a 1-model for M3,r,ψ by setting:

[formula]

Irreducibility

The model M1,p,f

We adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.2]. Let B1,p be the algebraic curvature tensor on [formula] defined by

[formula]

Let [formula]. If B1,p(ξ1,ξ2,η1,η2) = 0 [formula] [formula], then ξ2  =  λξ1.

[formula] is irreducible.

Let g0 be the usual Euclidean inner product; g0(Xi,Xj): = δij. Then:

[formula]

Let O(p) be the usual Euclidean orthogonal group. If θ∈O(p), then θ*B1,p = B1,p. By applying a suitable element of θ∈O(p) and rescaling if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality ξ1 = X1 in proving Assertion (1). We expand [formula]. For i > 1, ai = R(ξ1,ξ2,Xi,X1) = 0. Assertion (1) follows.

Suppose that we have a non-trivial decomposition [formula] which induces a decomposition [formula]. Let 0  ≠  ξi∈Wi. Then B1,p(ξ1,ξ2,  ·  ,  ·  ) = 0 so, by Assertion (1), ξ1  =  λξ2; this is false.

We showed in Section [\ref=sect-3.1] that U1,p is a 0-model for M1,p,f. Thus we must only show that U1,p is irreducible. Let

[formula]

Let π be the natural projection from [formula] to [formula]. We then have that A1,p  =  π*B1,p. Suppose there is a non-trivial decomposition:

[formula]

We argue for a contradiction. Since [formula], the metrics gi1,p are non-trivial on Vi. In particular, the subspaces Vi are not totally isotropic. Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.a]) induces a corresponding decomposition

[formula]

By Assertion (1), this decomposition of [formula] is trivial; we assume that the notation is chosen so [formula] and hence V2  ⊂  K so V2 is totally isotropic. This is a contradiction.

The model M2,s,F

We adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.2]. We define an algebraic curvature tensor B2,s on [formula] by setting:

[formula]

Let [formula]. If B2,s(ξ1,ξ2,η1,η2) = 0 and B2,s(ξ1,η1,η2,ξ2) = 0 for all [formula], then [formula].

[formula] is irreducible.

We extend θ∈O(s) to act diagonally on [formula]; we then have θ*B2,s = B2,s. Suppose that [formula]. By applying a suitably chosen element ξ∈O(s) and rescaling if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality

[formula]

for suitably chosen constants {b1,...,bs,c1,...,cs,d1,...,ds}. Let i > 1. We have

[formula]

This shows that c1 = 0 and ci = 0 so ξ2 = d1T1 + ... + dsTs. Furthermore,

[formula]

This implies ξ2 = 0 which is a contradiction. Thus [formula]. As the roles of ξ1 and ξ2 are symmetric, we conclude [formula] as well; Assertion (1) follows.

Suppose given a non-trivial decomposition [formula] which induces a decomposition [formula]. Choose 0  ≠  ξi∈Wi. By Assertion (2), ξ1,ξ2 belong to [formula]. Thus [formula] and [formula]. Thus [formula] is contained in [formula] which is false.

We showed in Section [\ref=sect-3.2] that U2,s is a 0-model for M2,s,F. Thus it suffices to show that U2,s is irreducible. Let

[formula]

Let π be the natural projection from [formula] to

[formula]

We have A2,s  =  π*B2,s. Suppose we have a non-trvial decomposition

[formula]

We argue for a contradiction. We argue as above to see V1 and V2 are not totally isotropic. Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.b]) induces a corresponding decomposition

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem-4.2], this decomposition must be trivial. We assume the notation chosen so that V2  ⊂  L. Thus V2 is totally isotropic. This is a contradiction.

The model U3,r

Adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.3]. Let 1  ≤  i < r. The non-zero entries in the curvature operator are, up to the usual [formula] symmetries,

[formula]

If [formula], then:

[formula]

Display ([\ref=eqn-4.c]) shows J(ξ)2r = 0. As J(X)2r - 1U1 = V1, U3,r is 2r-Osserman nilpotent; Theorem [\ref=thm-1.6] (3) follows.

We showed in Section [\ref=sect-3.3] that U3,r is a 0-model for M3,r,ψ. Thus it suffices to show U3,r is irreducible. We suppose the contrary and argue for a contradiction. Suppose there is a non-trivial decomposition

[formula]

As above, neither W1 nor W2 can be totally isotropic. Decompose X = X1 + X2. Then either J(X1) or J(X2) is nilpotent of order 2r; we may assume without loss of generality that the notation is chosen so that J(X1) is nilpotent of order 2r. Since J(X1)X1 = 0, this implies dim (W1)  ≥  2r + 1. Since the decomposition is assumed non-trivial, this implies dim (W2) = 1. Let ξ span W2; ξ can not be a null vector since W2 is not totally isotropic. On the other hand since dim (W2) = 1, A3,r(η1,η2)ξ = 0 for ηi∈W2. The decomposition of Equation ([\ref=eqn-4.d]) then shows A3,r(η1,η2)ξ = 0 for all [formula]. This implies [formula] which is a totally isotropic subspace; this is a contradiction.

Homogeneity

The manifolds M1,p,f

If φ is a symmetric bilinear form on V, then we may define an algebraic curvature tensor R(φ) on V by setting:

[formula]

One then has, see for example the discussion in [\cite=refDG],

Let φ1 and φ2 be symmetric positive definite bilinear forms on a vector space V of dimension at least 3. If R(φ1) = R(φ2), then φ1  =  φ2.

Adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.2]. Fix [formula] and let [formula]. We consider a 1-model

[formula]

Also consider the subspace

[formula]

Let π be the natural projection from VP to XP: = VP / YP. As

[formula]

if any ξi∈YP, there are structures HX,P, AX,P, and A1X,P on XP which are characterized by the identities:

[formula]

Assume M1,p,f is 1-curvature homogeneous. Let [formula]. Let Θ be an isomorphism from V1P to V1Q. It is immediate from the defining relation that Θ(YP)  ⊂  YQ; a dimension count then implies Θ(YP) = YQ. Consequently Θ induces a map :XP  →  XQ so

[formula]

We adopt the notation of Equation ([\ref=eqn-5.a]) and let R(φ) be the curvature tensor defined by a bilinear form φ. Since

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lem-5.1] implies that HX,P  =  *HX,Q. Let ||2φ denote the norm taken with respect to a positive definite bilinear form φ. We then have

[formula]

Consequently α1 is constant.

The manifolds M2,s,F

We begin by studying the Lie group associated to the model U2,s. We say that B  =  {u1,...,us,t1,...,ts,v1,...,vs} is a normalized basis for [formula] if the normalizations of Equation ([\ref=eqn-1.a]) hold, i.e.

[formula]

Let [formula] be the usual orthogonal group of s  ×  s matrices; κij∈O(s) if and only if [formula].

Let B and [formula] be two normalized bases for [formula]. If [formula], then there exists a matrix κ1∈O(s) and matrices [formula] so that:

[formula]

We note that

[formula]

Consequently we may express

[formula]

We verify that κ4∈O(s) by checking

[formula]

The orthogonal group acts diagonally on [formula] by

[formula]

This action preserves the structures involved. By making a suitable change of basis, therefore, we may suppose without loss of generality that [formula] in the proof of the Lemma, i.e. that we have:

[formula]

To show [formula], fix i  ≠  j. Since [formula], we can choose

[formula]

Expand [formula]. As [formula], we may compute

[formula]

This shows κ1,ik = 0 for i  ≠  k so κ1 is diagonal. Since

[formula]

and similarly 1 = κ1,jjκ1,iiκ1,ii, we have κ1,ii = 1 as desired. The identity g2s(ũi,ṽj) = δij then shows [formula] in this special situation.

Fix [formula] and let [formula]. Consider a 1-model

[formula]

Also consider the subspaces

[formula]

Let π be the natural projection from VP to XP: = VP / YP. There is a natural covariant derivative algebraic curvature tensor A1X,P on XP so [formula];

[formula]

The elements {Ũi: = π∂ui} are a basis for XP. Define a non-degenerate bilinear form LP on XP by requiring that

[formula]

If Θ is an isomorphism from V1P to V1Q, then clearly Θ(YP) = YQ. Consequently [formula] so Θ induces a map [formula] from XP to XQ.

To construct the normalized basis of Equation ([\ref=eqn-3.a]) we set:

[formula]

We apply Lemma [\ref=lem-5.2] to expand

[formula]

where κ1∈O(s). Since Ũi  =  πUi, [formula]. The following Lemma is now immediate:

If Θ is an isomorphism from V1P to V1Q, then *LQ = LP.

Assume M2,s,F is 1-curvature homogeneous. Let P and Q be points of [formula]. Let Θ be an isomorphism from V1P to V1Q. Since α2 = |A1X,P|2LP, Lemma [\ref=lem-5.3] implies α2 must be constant.

The manifolds M3,r,ψ

Adopt the notation of Section [\ref=sect-1.4]. Assume that [formula] and that [formula]. Set

[formula]

Assume that [formula] and [formula] for all points of [formula]. The possibly non-zero entries in [formula] are given by:

[formula]

We expand ξ  =  ξ0∂x  +  ξ1∂u1 + ... + ξr∂ur  +  ξr + 1∂vr + ... + ξ2r∂v1  +  ξ2r + 1∂y. Then

[formula]

Suppose that M3,r,ψ is curvature 2-homogeneous. Then KP is diffeomorphic to KQ for any two points P and Q of [formula]. Let P = (0,...,1,ur,0,....,0) and Q = (0,...,0,ur,0,...,0). Suppose [formula]. Then KP is connected and KQ is not connected; this is a contradiction. Suppose [formula]. Then KP is non-empty and KQ is empty; again, this is a contradiction.

Symmetric Spaces

We extend an argument of E. Cartan's from the Riemannian to the pseudo-Riemannian setting. Let {ei} be a parallel frame field along a geodesic σ. Then

[formula]

Thus [formula] for suitably chosen constants cij. Let Y(t) be a Jacobi vector field. Express Y(t) = ai(t)ei(t). Then:

[formula]

Since - aj(ξ; - t) still satisfies the Jacobi equation with the same initial condition, aj(ξ;t) =  - aj(ξ; - t) so aj is an odd function of t. Let gij: = g(ei,ej) be independent of t. Then

[formula]

is an even function of t. Since the geodesic involution takes Yξ(t) to - Yξ( - t), this shows the geodesic involution is an isometry and establishes the first assertion.

Let P,Q∈M. We suppose P  ≠  Q. Since exp P is a diffeomorphism from TPM to M, we can choose a geodesic σ so σ(0) = P and σ(1) = Q. Let [formula]. Then the geodesic involution centered at R interchanges P and Q and is an isometry. Thus M is a homogeneous space.
