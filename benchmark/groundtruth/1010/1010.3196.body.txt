Dynamics of Surfactants Spreading on Gel-like Materials: Cracking and Pattern Formation

Introduction

The deposition and spreading of drops of surfactant solutions on the surface of gels gives rise to the shaping of crack-like spreading "arms" in formations that resemble "starbursts". Marangoni stresses induced by surface tension gradients between the spreading surfactant and the uncontaminated gel layer are identified to be the main driving force behind the observed phenomena. Examples of these formations are shown in .

The morphology and spatio-temporal evolution of these "starburst" patterns is examined. We use drops laden with two types of surfactants: SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate), and Silwet L-77 (polyalkyleneoxide modified heptamethyltrisiloxane- a superspreader) in concentrations ranging from 0.3cmc to 100cmc. The underlying gel substrates are made of agar (a polysaccharide-based gel), and gelatine (a protein-based gels). Agar is used in concentrations from 0.04 wt% to 0.14 wt%, and gelatine is used in concentrations from 0.7 wt% to 0.17 wt%.
