Arithmetic properties of the first secant variety to a projective variety

Introduction

We work throughout over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Secant varieties are a classical subject, though the majority of work done involves determining the dimensions of secant varieties to well-known varieties. Perhaps the two most well-known results in this direction are the solution by Alexander and Hirschowitz (completed in [\cite=ah]) of the Waring problem for homogeneous polynomials and the classification of the Severi varieties by Zak [\cite=zak].

More recently there has been great interest, e.g. related to algebraic statistics and algebraic complexity, in determining the equations defining secant varieties (e.g. [\cite=ar], [\cite=bcg], [\cite=BGL], [\cite=CGG05a], [\cite=CGG05b], [\cite=CGG07], [\cite=CGG], [\cite=unex], [\cite=cs], [\cite=gss], [\cite=kanev], [\cite=Lan06], [\cite=Lan08], [\cite=LM08], [\cite=LW07], [\cite=LW08], [\cite=LO], [\cite=LO2], [\cite=OB], [\cite=sidsul], [\cite=ss]). In this work, we use the detailed geometric information concerning secant varieties developed by Bertram [\cite=bertram], Thaddeus [\cite=thaddeus], and the author [\cite=vermeireflip1] to study not just the equations defining secant varieties, but the syzygies among those equations as well. This program was carried out for smooth curves in [\cite=vermeirecurves].

Under an explicit positivity condition, we show that the first secant variety Σ to a smooth projective variety [formula] is projectively normal (Theorem [\ref=projnor]) and that IΣ is (2d + 3)-regular (Corollary [\ref=firstreg]), directly extending results of [\cite=vermeiresecreg] for smooth curves. We also obtain simple conditions on the intrinsic geometry of X which are equivalent to the condition that Σ is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (Theorem [\ref=acm]), extending results of [\cite=sidver] for curves. We then show (Theorem [\ref=forgeneral]) that if Xd satisfies Np + 2d, then Σ satisfies N3,p (see Corollares [\ref=list] and [\ref=list2] for a list of specific examples).

The positivity condition we will invoke is:

For p  ≥  0, we say [formula] satisfies NΣp if

the embedding of X is 3-very ample and satisfies N2,p; and

[formula] for [formula].

We devote the next section to the study of NΣp.

Note that in Notation and Terminology [\ref=maps], the morphism φ induced by |2H - E| embeds [formula]. Writing [formula], it will be shown in the proof of Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] that if [formula] for [formula], then the vanishing condition in Notation [\ref=starstar] is satisfied. Thus the vanishing condition is a reasonable positivity condition.

Condition NΣp

For curves, verification of NΣp is straightforward.

Let [formula] be a smooth curve satisfying Np, [formula], with L = OX(1) non-special. Then L satisfies NΣp.

We need to show [formula] for [formula].

Because X is projectively normal we have [formula] for [formula]. Thus [formula]. By [\cite=sidver], we know that [formula] (see also Lemma [\ref=change] where this is shown to be true in all dimensions).

Now, for [formula], the arguments in [\cite=vermeiresecreg] and in [\cite=sidver] go through under the stated hypotheses to give [formula] for [formula]. The extra hypothesis used in those papers (namely, that deg (L)  ≥  2g + 3) is needed only to show [formula] for [formula].

Verifying condition NΣp in the general case takes somewhat more work, but the end results are reasonable. We first need a computation which will be used in both Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] and in Theorem [\ref=forgeneral].

Let X be a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2. Then [formula].

Consider the sequence on [formula]:

[formula]

As [formula], pushing down to [formula] we have ([\cite=sidver])

[formula]

where d*M = OZ( - EΔ).

Thus [formula]. However, we know by [\cite=conrad] that

[formula]

where [formula] [\cite=hart]. Thus we have

[formula]

and so [formula]. Restricting (pulling back) this equality to Z and noting ([\cite=vermeireidealreg]) that [formula], we have [formula].

We now interpret the vanishing condition in the definition of NΣp in terms of X.

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2 such that [formula] for [formula], [formula], [formula]. Then [formula] for [formula].

Suppose b = 2r is even. We know by the proof of [\cite=vermeireidealreg] that [formula]; thus

[formula]

Because [formula], we know [formula] for some line bundle M, and hence we know that [formula], but this says that [formula]. From the sequences

[formula]

for k + 1  ≤  r we see that [formula], as the cohomology of the rightmost terms vanishes by hypothesis since [formula].

Now, suppose that b = 2r + 1 is odd. As in the previous paragraph, we have [formula], thus we see that [formula]. It is therefore enough to show that [formula], and then repeating the same argument as above gives [formula].

We have the sequence on Z

[formula]

where [formula] by Lemma [\ref=det]. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=det], we have [formula], thus

[formula]

Thus it suffices to show [formula]. However, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

and so the cohomology of each vanishes by hypothesis.

Fortunately, the vanishing in Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] is not too difficult to understand.

Let X be a smooth variety of dimension d, M a very ample line bundle. Choose k so that k  ≥  d + 3 and so that [formula] is big and nef. Letting L = Mk, we have

[formula]

for [formula], [formula], [formula].

Note as above that [formula], where EΔ  →  Δ is the exceptional divisor of the blow-up. Note further that [formula].

Assume first that [formula]. Then

[formula]

but this is KZ + B where

[formula]

Because Mk - KX is ample, [formula] is ample. We are thus left to show that

[formula]

is globally generated. However, as k  ≥  d + 3, we have k(r - 1)  ≥  d - 1 + 2r and so [formula] is globally generated by [\cite=bel]. Thus B is big and nef and so vanishing follows from Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing [\cite=kaw],[\cite=vie].

Now let r = 1. Then

[formula]

but this is KZ + B where

[formula]

As above, B is big and nef.

The following embedded varieties satisfy NΣp, [formula]:

X is a non-special smooth curve satisfying Np (Proposition [\ref=starstarforcurves]).

X is a smooth variety embedded by a sufficiently high power of an ample line bundle.

[formula] is a smooth variety embedded by [formula], k  ≥  p, where M is very ample and [formula] is ample.

[formula] is a smooth Fano variety embedded by L = ( - KX)r where r  ≥  d + p - 1.

Xd is an abelian variety embedded by Lk, where L is ample and [formula].

Xd is a smooth projective toric variety embedded by Lk, where L is ample, [formula] is ample, and k  ≥   max {d + 3,d + p - 1}.

X = G / P where [formula], P is a parabolic subgroup, and L = Mr where M is a very ample line bundle such that the embedding by L is 3-very ample and r  ≥  p.

[formula] where [formula].

For part (2), we note that a sufficiently high power of an ample line bundle satisfies Np by [\cite=mgreen],[\cite=inamdar]. Further, the vanishing in Proposition [\ref=vanishonsec] is easily seen to hold for sufficiently high powers as well.

For part (3), it is shown in [\cite=el] that [formula] satisfies Nk, [formula]. The result now follows from Remark [\ref=adjoint].

Part (4) follows as in part (3) together with Remark [\ref=fano].

For part (5), it is shown in [\cite=bs] that Lk is (k - 2)-very ample and it is shown in [\cite=par], [\cite=pp] that Lk satisfies Nk - 3. It is shown in [\cite=parwahl] that [formula] for [formula], [formula] and [formula].

For (6), it is shown in [\cite=hss] that X satisfies Np. The result now follows by Proposition [\ref=uniform].

For (7), it is shown in [\cite=man] that if X = G / P where [formula], P is a parabolic subgroup, and L is a very ample line bundle, then the embedding by Lp satisfies Np. By [\cite=kumar] and [\cite=wahl2] we know that [formula] for [formula], [formula] as long as L = Mk, [formula].

For (8), it is shown in [\cite=hss] that X satisfies Np, and again by [\cite=kumar] and [\cite=wahl2] we are done.

Projective Normality

If [formula] is smooth, projectively normal, and satisfies NΣ2d, then Σ is projectively normal.

By [\cite=vermeiresing] Σ is normal and by [\cite=vermeiresecreg] [formula] is linearly normal.

We use the fact that [formula] and the standard diagram

By induction on [formula], we see that if [formula] then [formula]. We will show below (Theorem [\ref=forgeneral]) that [formula] for [formula] as a consequence of a more general approach studying the syzygies of IΣ. It will thus be sufficient to show that [formula].

Consider the morphism [formula]; we write [formula]. Pushing the sequence

[formula]

down to [formula] yields

[formula]

From the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

and because the restriction of [formula] to a fiber of the [formula]-bundle [formula] is O( - 1), we immediately see that [formula] and [formula].

Putting these together, consider the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

Applying φ* yields

[formula]

and so [formula] splits as a direct sum; in particular,

[formula]

is an injection. However, by the Künneth formula [formula], but this is precisely [formula], hence [formula].

In all the examples of Remark [\ref=list], Σ is projectively normal for p  ≥  2d.

Regularity and Cohen-Macaulayness

Suppose [formula] is a 3-very ample embedding of a smooth projective variety satisfying N2,2. Then [formula].

Consider the sequence

[formula]

We know that Riπ*OE1(kH - E2) = 0 for i = 0,1, and that [formula] otherwise. From the sequence

[formula]

we see that [formula] for [formula]. Thus a local computation gives Riπ*OB2(kH - E1 - E2) = 0 for [formula], and so [formula].

Suppose [formula] is projectively normal and satisfies NΣ2d, and that Hi(X,OX(r)) = 0 for [formula]. Then [formula] for [formula].

We use the condition found in Lemma [\ref=change]. We already have this for i = 1. For k = 1, i > 1, consider the sequence

[formula]

As [formula], we have [formula] for [formula].

We now have our result for i = 1 and for k = 1. This gives Hi(Σ,OΣ(1)) = 0 for [formula]. Thus, by induction on k it suffices to show that [formula] for [formula] just as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=projnor]. Again, in Theorem [\ref=forgeneral] we show that [formula] for i  ≥  2 and [formula]. Thus we will be left to show [formula] for i  ≥  2. Equivalently, we may show Hi(Σ,OΣ(2)) = 0 for [formula]. From the sequence

[formula]

it suffices to show [formula] for [formula]. Consider the line bundle [formula] on Z. We know that [formula] for [formula] by hypothesis. However, [formula], hence [formula] for [formula].

Suppose [formula] is smooth, projectively normal, and satisfies NΣ2d, and that Hi(X,OX(r)) = 0 for [formula]. Then IΣ is (2d + 3)-regular.

If [formula] is amooth, projectively normal, and satisfies NΣ2, then [formula] for k < 0, 0  ≤  i  ≤  d + 2.

This is obvious for i = 0. For i > 0, we show Hi - 1(Σ,OΣ(k)) = 0. By Kawamata-Viehweg, we know [formula] for 1  ≤  i  ≤  2d + 1.

For [formula], we know that [formula] since k < 0. Thus for j = i - 1  ≤  d - 1, we have

[formula]

and hence [formula] for k < 0 and 0  ≤  i  ≤  d + 1.

To show Hd + 1(Σ,OΣ(k)) = 0 for k < 0, note that

[formula]

for j < d. Thus E0,d + 12 = E0,d + 1∞ = 0. Looking at the Ed + 1,0* terms, we have the complexes

[formula]

but we just proved that Ed + 1 - i,i - 1i = Ed + 1 - i,i - 12 = 0, and hence Ed + 1,02 = Ed + 1,0∞. Now by [\cite=sidver], we have Ed + 1,02 = 0.

Let [formula] be a smooth, non-special curve satisfying N2. Then Σ is ACM and IΣ is 5-regular.

Suppose [formula] is a smooth variety satisfying NΣ2. If [formula] and [formula] for some [formula], then Σ is not ACM.

Suppose [formula] and consider the spectral sequence with [formula] for k < 0. It is straightforward to check that Ed,ii + 2 = Ed,i∞ and that Ed + i + 1,0i + 2 = Ed + i + 1,0∞; from the fact that [formula] for j  ≤  2d, we know that Ed,i∞ = Ed + i + 1,0∞ = 0 for i  ≤  d - 1. Therefore, from the complex

[formula]

we see that the nontrivial map is actually an isomorphism, hence we have

[formula]

However, as k < 0 we know that [formula] for all k <  < 0, thus Σ is not ACM.

Suppose [formula] is a smooth variety satisfying NΣ2. If Hj(X,OX) = 0 for j > 0, then [formula] for k < 0, 0  ≤  i  ≤  2d + 1.

Suppose [formula] is a smooth variety of dimension [formula]. Suppose [formula] is projectively normal and satisfies NΣ2d, and that Hi(X,OX(r)) = 0 for [formula]. Then the following are equivalent:

Hj(X,OX) = 0 for j > 0.

Σ is ACM.

Σ has rational singularities.

Further, if one of these conditions is satisfied, then IΣ is (2d + 1)-regular.

Clearly, [formula] for [formula]. Thus we are left to show Hi(Σ,OΣ) = 0 for [formula]. By [\cite=sidver] we have [formula]. By hypothesis we have Hi(Z,OZ) = 0 for [formula], hence [formula] for [formula]. However, our hypothesis also implies that [formula] for [formula], hence [formula].

Macaulay 2 [\cite=M2] calculations performed by Jessica Sidman show that for [formula] and for [formula], Σ is 5-regular but not 4-regular.

Syzygies

Having established the basic normality and regularity results, following [\cite=mgreen] we turn our attention to defining equations and syzygies.

Our starting point is the familiar:

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L. Then Σ satisfies [formula] if [formula], 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, b  ≥  2.

Because L also induces an embedding [formula], we abuse notation and denote the associated vector bundle on Σ by ML. Letting [formula] and applying [\cite=eisenbud] to OΣ gives the exact sequence:

[formula]

The vanishing in the hypothesis implies that [formula] for d  ≥  k + 1, and hence that the first syzygies of OΣ, which are the generators of the ideal of Σ, are in degree ≤  k. The rest of the vanishings yield the analogous statements for higher syzygies.

[formula]

The remaining technical portion of the paper is devoted to reinterpreting the vanishings in Proposition [\ref=basic] in terms of vanishings on the Hilbert scheme [formula], and then finally on X itself.

If X is a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2, then Σ satisfies [formula] if

[formula]

is injective for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, b  ≥  2.

This follows immediately from the start of the 5-term sequence associated to the Leray-Serre spectral sequence:

[formula]

and Proposition [\ref=basic].

Let [formula] be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L satisfying NΣp with Hi(X,Lk) = 0 for [formula]. Then Σ satisfies [formula] if [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, [formula].

We use Proposition [\ref=prop:_wts_trans]. From the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

we know

[formula]

The first equality follows as the restriction of [formula] to Z is [formula], the second is standard, and for the third we use the Künneth formula together with the fact that [formula] as X satisfies N2,p.

Thus

[formula]

and so by Proposition [\ref=prop:_wts_trans] it is enough to show that [formula] for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, [formula].

From the sequence

[formula]

and the fact that [formula], we see that [formula] for [formula].

Let X be a smooth variety embedded by a 3-very ample line bundle L satisfying N2,2 and consider the morphism [formula] induced by the linear system |2H - E|. Then [formula], and hence [formula].

Consider the diagram on [formula]:

The vertical map in the middle is surjective as we have [formula]. Therefore, surjectivity of the lower right horizontal map and commutativity of the diagram show that the righthand vertical map is surjective. Note that [formula] by the projection formula and that the higher direct image sheaves [formula] vanish as [formula] is a [formula]-bundle over [formula] For the higher direct images, we have Riφ*π*L = 0 as the restriction of L to a fiber of φ is O(1) and hence the cohomology along the fibers vanishes. From the rightmost column, we see Riφ*K = 0. From the leftmost column, we have the sequence

[formula]

but as [formula], we have [formula].

Combining Proposition [\ref=prop:_wts_van] with Lemma [\ref=downtohilb] yields:

Let X be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L satisfying NΣp with Hi(X,Lk) = 0 for [formula]. Then Σ satisfies [formula] if

[formula]

for 2  ≤  a  ≤  p + 1, [formula].

Let Xd be a smooth variety embedded by a line bundle L satisfying NΣp + 2d with Hi(X,Lk) = 0 for [formula]. Then Σ satisfies [formula]

Pushing the sequence

[formula]

down to [formula] yields

[formula]

where the non-trivial part of the sequence comes from twisting the diagram in Lemma [\ref=downtohilb] by π*L and pushing down to [formula].

From the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

and noting that the restriction of [formula] to a fiber of the [formula]-bundle [formula] is O( - 1), we immediately see that:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

for [formula].

Putting these together, consider the sequence on [formula]

[formula]

Applying φ* yields

[formula]

By the assumption that X satisfies Np + 2d, we know that [formula] for 0  ≤  a  ≤  p + 2d + 1. However, for [formula] this is precisely [formula]. It is straightforward to check that E0,i2 = E0,i∞, and thus we have an injection of Hi into E0,i∞; however, E0,i∞ is a quotient of Hi, hence this is an isomorphism.

Thus we have [formula] for [formula] and 0  ≤  a  ≤  p + 2d + 1. In particular, we have [formula] for [formula] and 0  ≤  a  ≤  p + 2d + 1. Together with Corollary [\ref=onhilb] this completes the proof.

As above, we have:

In all the examples of Remark [\ref=list], Σ satisfies N3,p - 2d.

Let [formula], [formula]. We know by [\cite=birkenhake] that X2k satisfies N3k - 3, and hence by Corollary [\ref=list] we have Σ satisfies N3,3k - 7.

It has been shown [\cite=bcr] that Xdk satisfies Nk + 1 for all d, hence Σ at least satisfies N3,k - 2d. It is conjectured in [\cite=op] that for [formula], [formula] we have Xdk satisfies N3k - 3, which would imply that Σ satisfies N3,3k - 3 - 2d.

Macaulay 2 [\cite=M2] calculations performed by Jessica Sidman show that for [formula], Σ satisfies N3,4 and for [formula], Σ satisfies N3,7. Together with the known behavior for rational normal curves and the conjecture of [\cite=op] mentioned above, this suggests the following:

For [formula], [formula], the secant variety to [formula] satisfies N3,3k - 5.
