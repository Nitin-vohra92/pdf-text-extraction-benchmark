Corrections to "Unified Laguerre polynomial-series-based distribution of small-scale fading envelopes"

Two typographical errors in Chai and Tjhung's paper [\cite=Chai]

In an interesting paper, Chai and Tjhung [\cite=Chai] proposed new unified probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) formulas based on the generalized Laguerre polynomial series expansion that cover a wide range of small-scale fading distributions in wireless communications. Many known Laguerre polynomial-series-based small-scale fading distributions are special cases of their results, which include the multiple-waves-plus-diffuse-power (MWDP) fading, κ  -  μ (noncentral chi), Nakagami- m, Rician (Nakagami- n), Nakagami- q (Hoyt), Rayleigh, Weibull, and α  -  μ (Stacy) distributions.

First we present two typographical errors of [\cite=Chai]:

1. Chai and Tjhung stated that the orthogonality relation of generalized Laguerre polynomial is expressed as [\cite=Chai]

[formula]

where Lμn is the generalized Laguerre polynomial, defined as [\cite=Abramowitz]

[formula]

However, there is a typographical error in [\cite=Chai]. The correct formula is

[formula]

2. The Laguerre polynomial expansion coefficients Cn for the pdf fX(x) of random variable X was determined by [\cite=Chai]. The fading envelop random variable R is assumed to satisfy

[formula]

where α,b are parameters. Chai and Tjhung claimed that [\cite=Chai]

[formula]

which contains a small typographical error. The correct expression is given by

[formula]

Using this and [\cite=Chai], the coefficients Cn can be expressed by the αkth moment of the fading envelope R.

the correct unified cdf formula

Chai and Tjhung presented an unified cdf formula for the fading envelope R in [\cite=Chai], i.e.,

[formula]

where α,β,b are some parameters depending on the type of fading distribution and are presented in [\cite=Chai] for some special cases.

Unfortunately, the third line of the formula ([\ref=eq1]) is not valid, because [formula] is outside of the summation and the generalized Laguerre polynomial Lβ + 1n - 1 is not defined for n = 0. The correct formula of the unified cdf is

[formula]

where we used that Lμ0(x) = 1 and C0 = 1. Here γ(  ·  ,  ·  ) is the lower incomplete gamma function, defined by [\cite=Abramowitz]

[formula]

Therefore, the unified Laguerre polynomial-series-based cdf contains one term expressed with the aid of the lower incomplete gamma function.

One special case of the unified cdf formula Eq. ([\ref=eq6])

We now provide a Laguerre polynomial-series-based cdf formula for non-central chi-square distribution as a special case of Eq. ([\ref=eq6]). The pdf of non-central chi-square distribution χ2ν,λ with ν degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter λ is given by [\cite=Johnson]

[formula]

which is equivalent to the pdf of κ  -  μ power distribution defined by [\cite=Yacoub]. Tiku proposed the Laguerre polynomial expansion of fχ2ν,λ(r) in 1965 [\cite=Tiku], which is given by (see also [\cite=Johnson])

[formula]

Gideon and Gurland obtained a Laguerre polynomial expansion of the cdf of non-central chi-square distribution in 1977 [\cite=Gideon] (see also [\cite=Johnson] with the parameter set of L0), i.e.,

[formula]

Some other Laguerre polynomial expansions of Fχ2ν,λ(R) are available in [\cite=Gideon] and [\cite=Johnson]. We note that the pdf and cdf formulas in Eq. ([\ref=eq4]) and Eq. ([\ref=eq5]) can be derived by choosing α = 1, b = 2, β  =  ν / 2 - 1 and Cn = ( - λ / 2)n / n! in [\cite=Chai] and Eq. ([\ref=eq6]) in previous section.
