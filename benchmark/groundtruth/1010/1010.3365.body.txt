Nonamenable Liouville Graphs

Introduction

We describe an example of a bounded degree graph with a positive Cheeger constant (nonamenable) which is Liouville, that is admits no non constant bounded harmonic functions. A much more complicated example of bounded geometry simply connected Riemannian manifold with these properties was constructed in [\cite=BC]. Nonamenable Cayley graphs are not Liouville [\cite=KV], since the question "does nonamenability implies non Liouville for general bounded degree graphs?" keeps coming up and the example below is transparent (unlike [\cite=BC]) , we decided to write it down. The last section contains related conjectures.

Recall that a graph is nonamenable if there is C  >  0,

[formula]

for every finite nonempty set of vertices S, where ∂S denotes the neighbours of S, (vertices not in S with a neighbour in S).

The basic idea is to start with a binary tree and add edges to it, in order "to collapse the different directions simple random walk can escape to infinity". This will be done using expanders, which is a family of finite d-regular graphs, Gn, growing in size, for which the isoperimetric condition above holds for any set of at most half the size of Gn, for all n. For background on expanders see e.g. [\cite=HLW].

The example might be relevant to some modelling in genetics.

The example

Example: On the vertices of each level of a binary tree place a 3-regular expander.

Denote this graph by G. Since the binary tree is nonamenable G is too. For the Liouville property, examine Ln, the [formula] level of the tree. Consider it as a probability space (with the probability of each point 2- n). For x∈Ln and y∈Ln + 1 define p(x,y) be the probability that random walk starting from x will first hit Ln + 1 in y. The corresponding operator will be denoted by T = Tn i.e. for every [formula] let [formula] be defined by

[formula]

Next, denote by ||T||p  →  q the norm of T as an operator from Lp(Ln)  →  Lq(Ln + 1). We immediately get ||T||1  →  1  ≤  1 because T is linear and sends probability measures to probability measures (the 2 in the definition of T cancels out with the difference between the measures on Ln and Ln + 1).

Further, ||T||∞    →    ∞ is also ≤  1. To see this write

[formula]

so

[formula]

Now by time reversal, [formula] is the same as the expected number of times a random walk starting from y visits Ln before exiting the ball [formula] -- here we need to define the time the random walker exits Bn only after the first step. This expectation is easy to calculate. Denote the number of visits by V. There is probability [formula] that the first step of the walker goes to Bn, which is necessary for V  ≠  0. Afterwards each time our walker reaches Ln there is probability [formula] for it to exit Bn. Hence the number of visits after first entering Bn is a geometric variable with mean 3, and we get [formula] so ||T||∞    →    ∞  ≤  1. By the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem we get

[formula]

Let now u∈Lk be some vertex and denote μn the harmonic measure Ln starting at u (assume n  ≥  k). Let fn = 2nμn - 1. In fact, fn is simply applying T repeatedly to [formula] where [formula] is a Kronecker δ at u. Because T sends probability measures to probability measures we always get that [formula]. Because of the probabilistic interpretation of T we can examine the first step and only then apply T. For the first step there is probability [formula] to go to Ln + 1, probability [formula] to stay in Ln and probability [formula] to go back to Ln - 1. Denoting these operators (normalised to have norm 1) by S1, S2 and S3 we get

[formula]

The same reasoning as above shows that ||Si||2  →  2  ≤  1 and further, because S2 is the operator corresponding to a random walk on an expander, and because the average of f is zero we get ||S2f||2  ≤  (1 - λ)f where λ is the spectral gap of the expander we put on the levels. In fact, let's define λ as the infimum of these spectral gaps over all levels so we do not need to define λn etc. All in all we get

[formula]

so ||fn||2  →  0 as n  →    ∞  .

To finish the proof use that ||T||∞    →    ∞  ≤  1 so ||fn||∞  ≤  C. Hence we also get ||fn||1  →  0 as n  →    ∞  . To show that G is Liouville, use Poisson's formula for harmonic function h with respect to level n large.

[formula]

since h is bounded. Here again μun and μvn denote the harmonic measures on level n starting at u and v respectively.

Conjectures and Questions

What if we replace the binary tree by another nonamenable graph, on which we add expanders on all spheres around a fixed vertex? We were able to show that there is such graph which is not Liouville. The construction, very roughly, starts with an unbalanced tree (i.e. a binary tree where the father is connected to its left child by a regular edge, but to its right child with a double edge). We then utilised the fact that the harmonic measure is highly non-uniform on the levels and added a graph which is an expander with respect to the uniform measure but not with respect to the harmonic measure. We skip all details.

In the example balls around the root are uniform expanders, (when considering the induced finite graph on the vertices of the ball). An old conjecture of the first author is that there is no infinite Cayley graph with this property, moreover there is no infinite bounded degree connected graph in which all balls, centered at any vertex, are uniformly expanders. Verify this for the example above. Here is a heuristic. A Cayley graph in which all balls are expanders is non amenable and will admit non constant bounded harmonic functions yet is somewhat similar to the example above and thus should be Liouville, contradiction.

Maybe a stronger spectral requirement will imply existence of non constant bounded harmonic functions:

An infinite d-regular graph G is called Ramanujan, if the spectral radius of the Markov operator (acting on l2 of the vertices) equals [formula] which is what it is for the d-regular tree. When G is connected, this spectral radius can be expressed as the limiting exponent of the probabilities of return of a random walk, that is,  lim pn(v,v)1 / n.

Infinite Ramanujan graphs are not Liouville.

See [\cite=GKN] for partial affirmative answer.

For general graphs, Liouville property is unstable under quasi-isometries, [\cite=T]. For a very simple example see [\cite=BR], [\cite=BS]. It will be useful to have,

A graph G, which is quasi-isometric to a nonamenable Cayley graph, is not Liouville.

Conjecture 2 will be useful in pushing the heuristic regarding an attack on the old conjecture mentioned above for Cayley graphs by adding more edges in a quasi isometric manner to get a graph closely imitating the example above.

Assume [formula] acts on G by isometries and [formula] is Liouville. Moreover, assume that for some choice of fundamental domain F, simple random walk on G visits every translation of F infinitely often a.s.

Is G Liouville?

In his proof of Gromov's theorem, Kleiner proved that every Cayley graph admits a non-constant Lipschitz harmonic function, [\cite=Kl]. This cannot be true for a general graph because some graphs admits no non-constant harmonic functions at all. For example, the half-line, or consider a half ladder which admits an exponentially growing harmonic functions other then the constants. Uri Bader asked which general graphs admit a non-constant Lipschitz harmonic function? In particular does every transient graph or any graph with more than one end admit a non-constant Lipschitz harmonic function?
