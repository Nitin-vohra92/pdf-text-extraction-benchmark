Introduction

In 1988, Zhu obtained the conditions in order that a positive Toeplitz operator is bounded or compact on the Bergman space of a bounded symmetric domain in its Harish-Chandra realization [\cite=Zhu1]. In this paper, we extend this result for the case that the domain is a minimal bounded homogeneous domain.

Let D be a bounded homogeneous domain in [formula], dV(z) the Lebesgue measure, O(D) the space of all holomorphic functions on D, and L2a(D) the Bergman space [formula] of D. We denote by KD the Bergman kernel of D, that is, the reproducing kernel of L2a(D). It is known that U is a minimal domain with a center t if and only if KU(z,t)  =  KU(t,t) for any z∈U (see [\cite=MM]). For example, the open unit disk [formula], the open unit ball [formula] and the bidisk [formula] are minimal domains. It is known that every bounded homogeneous domain is biholomorphic to a minimal bounded homogeneous domain (see [\cite=I-Y]).

Let μ be a complex Borel measure on U. The Toeplitz operator Tμ with symbol μ is defined by

[formula]

If dμ(w)  =  u(w)dV(w) holds for some u∈L∞(U), we have Tμf = P(uf), where P is the orthogonal projection from L2(U) onto L2a(U). Therefore, Tμ is a bounded operator on L2a(U) with [formula]. We consider the condition of μ that Tμ is a bounded (or compact) operator on L2a(U).

A Toeplitz operator is called positive if its symbol is positive. A result on positive Toeplitz operator of a bounded symmetric domain was obtained in [\cite=Zhu1]. Zhu proved that the boundedness of the positive Toeplitz operator on L2a(Ω) is equivalent to the boundedness of the Berezin transform [formula] or the averaging function [formula] on Ω. The key lemma is [\cite=BCZ]. The proof of this lemma is based on some characteristic properties of a bounded symmetric domain in its Harish-Chandra realization. It is difficult to generalize directly their argument for a bounded homogeneous domain, which is not necessarily symmetric. However, the following theorem enables us to prove the same key estimate (Lemma [\ref=Lemma1]) for the Bergman kernel of a minimal bounded homogeneous domain.

Let [formula] be a minimal bounded homogeneous domain. Take any ρ > 0. Then, there exists Cρ > 0 such that

[formula]

for all z,a∈U with β(z,a)  ≤  ρ, where β denotes the Bergman distance on U.

Using Lemma [formula] and Zhu's method (see [\cite=Zhu1] or [\cite=Zhu3]), we deduce a certain relation of averaging functions to the Carleson measures (Theorem [\ref=thmCarleson]). Moreover, we obtain the following theorem.

Let [formula] be a minimal bounded homogeneous domain and μ a positive Borel measure on U. Then the following conditions are all equivalent. (a)  Tμ is a bounded operator on L2a(U). (b)  The Berezin transform [formula] is a bounded function on U. (c)  For all p  ≥  1, μ is a Carleson measure for Lpa(U). (d)  The averaging function (z) is bounded on U.

The representative domain of the tube domain over the Vinberg's cone is an example of nonsymmetric minimal bounded homogeneous domain. Theorem [\ref=Bddness*] generalizes Zhu's result ([\cite=Zhu1]) to such domain, for instance.

In the part [formula], we use the boundedness of the positive Bergman operator P+U on L2(U,dV). Using Schur's theorem (see [\cite=Zhu3]), it is sufficient to find a positive function h and a positive constant C such that

[formula]

holds for all z∈U. If U is a bounded symmetric domain in its Harish-Chandra realization, we can construct such h and C from the Forelli-Rudin inequalities (see [\cite=Zhu3], [\cite=Eng]). But it is difficult to do this on minimal bounded homogeneous domains. Instead, we make use of the boundedness of the positive Bergman operator P+D on L2(D,dV), where D is a homogeneous Siegel domain of type II ([\cite=B-K]). Since every bounded homogeneous domain is biholomorphic to some Siegel domain, we deduce the boundedness of P+U (see section 2.4).

To prove the compactness of Tμ, we consider a vanishing Carleson measure for L2a(U). We know that KU(a,a)  →    ∞   as a  →  ∂U (see [\cite=Koba]). Therefore, we can prove Theorem [formula] in the same way as in [\cite=Zhu3]. We obtain the condition of the compactness of the Toeplitz operator.

Let [formula] be a minimal bounded homogeneous domain and μ a finite positive Borel measure on U. Then the following conditions are all equivalent. (a)  Tμ is a compact operator on L2a(U). (b)  The Berezin transform [formula] tends to 0 as z  →  ∂U. (c)  μ is a vanishing Carleson measure for L2a(U). (d)  The averaging function (z) tends to 0 as z  →  ∂U.

Preliminaries

Minimal domain

Let D be a bounded domain in [formula]. We say that D is a minimal domain with a center t∈D if the following condition is satisfied: for every biholomorphism [formula] with det J(ψ,t) = 1, we have

[formula]

From [\cite=I-K] or [\cite=MM], we see that D is a minimal domain with a center t if and only if

[formula]

for any z∈D.

The representative bounded homogeneous domain is a generalization of the Harish-Chandra realization for a bounded symmetric domain. Indeed, every bounded homogeneous domain is biholomorphic to a representative bounded homogeneous domain. It is known that any representative bounded homogeneous domain is a minimal domain with a center 0 (see [\cite=I-K]). Therefore, every bounded homogeneous domain is biholomorphic to a minimal bounded homogeneous domain.

Berezin symbol

We fix a minimal bounded homogeneous domain U with a center t. For a bounded linear operator T on L2a(U), the Berezin symbol [formula] of T is defined by

[formula]

For a Borel measure μ on U, we define a function [formula] on U by

[formula]

which is called the Berezin symbol of the measure μ. Since [formula] is a bounded function on B(t,ρ)  ×  U (see [\cite=I-Y]), [formula] is a continuous function if μ is finite.

Suppose that the Toeplitz operator Tμ is a bounded operator on L2a(U). We have

[formula]

by the definition of the reproducing kernel. The right hand side equals

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Carleson measure and vanishing Carleson measure

Let μ be a positive Borel measure on U and p  ≥  1. We say that μ is a Carleson measure for Lpa(U) if there exists a constant M > 0 such that

[formula]

for all f∈Lpa(U). It is easy to see that μ is a Carleson measure for Lpa(U) if and only if Lpa(U)  ⊂  Lpa(U,dμ) and the inclusion map

[formula]

is bounded.

Suppose μ is a Carleson measure for L2a(U). We say that μ is a vanishing Carleson measure for L2a(U) if the inclusion map

[formula]

is compact.

Boundedness of the positive Bergman operator

In order to prove the part [formula] in Theorem [formula], we use the boundedness of the positive Bergman operator P+U on L2(U,dV) defined by

[formula]

for g∈L2(U,dV). We prove that P+U is a bounded operator on L2(U,dV).

It is known that every bounded homogeneous domain is holomorphically equivalent to a homogeneous Siegel domain [\cite=VGS]. Let Φ be a biholomorphic map from U to a Siegel domain D. We define a unitary map UΦ from L2(U,dV) to L2(D,dV) by

[formula]

Then, we have

[formula]

Therefore, the boundedness of P+U on L2(U,dV) is equivalent to the boundedness of P+D on L2(D,dV). On the other hand, Békollé-Kagou proved the boundedness of the positive Bergman operator P+D on L2(D,dV) ([\cite=B-K]). Therefore, we have the following lemma.

The operator P+U is bounded on L2(U,dV).

Some Lemmas

In this section, we show some lemmas for a minimal bounded homogeneous domain U with a center t∈U. Although the proofs of these lemmas are almost same as the ones for the case of symmetric domain ([\cite=BCZ],[\cite=ZhuBMO],[\cite=Zhu3]), we write them here for the sake of completeness. In this section, K(z,w) means KU(z,w). First, we present the following theorem, which plays fundamental roles in this work.

For any ρ > 0, there exists Cρ > 0 such that

[formula]

for all z,a∈U such that β(z,a)  ≤  ρ.

For a∈U, let φa be an automorphism of U such that φa(a) = t. Using Theorem [\ref=Ishi], we prove Theorem [formula]. First, we prove some lemmas.

One has

[formula]

where det J(φa,z) is the complex Jacobian of φa at z.

By the transformation formula of the Bergman kernel, we have

[formula]

Since K(φa(z),φa(a))  =  K(φa(z),t)  =  K(t,t), we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

This means

[formula]

From () and (), we obtain (). The equality () follows from

[formula]

For any z∈U and ρ > 0, let

[formula]

be the Bergman metric disk with center z and radius ρ.

There exists a constant Mρ such that

[formula]

for all a∈U and z∈B(a,ρ).

Thanks to the invariance of the Bergman distance under biholomorphic transformations, we have

[formula]

By Lemma [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Since u∈B(t,ρ) means β(t,u)  ≤  ρ, we have β(a,φ- 1a(u))  ≤  ρ, so that Theorem [formula] implies

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Multiplying () by (), we obtain

[formula]

By () and (), we complete the proof with Mρ  =  C2ρK(t,t)Vol  (B(t,ρ)).

Since one uses not the symmetry but the homogeneity of a complex domain in the proof of [\cite=ZhuBMO], the following lemma holds for the minimal bounded homogeneous domain U.

There exists a sequence {wj}  ⊂  U satisfying the following conditions. [formula] [formula] (S3) There exists a positive integer N such that each point z∈U belongs to at most N of the sets B(wj,2ρ).

There exists a constant C such that

[formula]

for all f∈O(U),  p  ≥  1 and a∈U.

First, we consider the case a = t. Since the Bergman metric induces the usual Euclidean topology on U, there exists a Euclidean ball E(t,R) with center t and the radius R such that E(t,R)  ⊂  B(t,ρ). Let f be a holomorphic function on U. Since f has a mean value property, we have

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

where q denotes the conjugate exponent of p. Since

[formula]

the last term of () is equal to

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

because [formula].

Now, put [formula]. Note that the constant CR is independent of p and f. Since E(t,R)  ⊂  B(t,ρ), we have

[formula]

Next, we prove the general case. Since [formula] is a holomorphic function on U, we have

[formula]

by (). Put w: = φ- 1a(z). Then the inequality () means

[formula]

By Lemma [formula], the right hand side is equal to

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

By Theorem [formula], we have

[formula]

on w∈B(a,ρ). Therefore we have

[formula]

by () and (). We see from () and Lemma [\ref=Lemma1] that

[formula]

Hence we obtain

[formula]

By () and (), we have

[formula]

with C  =  C4ρCRMρK(t,t)- 1.

There exists a constant C such that

[formula]

for all f∈O(U),p  ≥  1 and a∈U.

By Lemma [\ref=Lemma5], there exists a constant C such that

[formula]

for any f∈O(U),  p  ≥  1 and w∈U. Therefore we have

[formula]

where the last inequality holds because B(w,ρ) is a subset of B(a,2ρ) for all w∈B(a,ρ). Hence, it is sufficient to prove

[formula]

Take any w∈B(a,ρ) and let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

by Lemma [formula]. Therefore, we obtain

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

Since β(w,a),  β(w,b) and β(a,b) do not exceed ρ, we have

[formula]

by Theorem [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

by () and ().

By Lemmas [\ref=Lemma1], [\ref=Lemma4] and [\ref=PropCarl], we can prove the following theorem as in the same way of the proof of [\cite=Zhu1]. It follows from this theorem that the property of being a Carleson measure is independent of p.

Suppose μ is a positive Borel measure on U and p  ≥  1. Then μ is a Carleson measure for Lpa(U) if and only if

[formula]

It is known that H: = span〈KU(  ·  ,w)〉w∈U is dense in L2a(U). On the other hand, KU(  ·  ,w) is bounded for each w∈U (see [\cite=I-Y]). Therefore H  ⊂  H∞, so that H∞ is dense in L2a(U). Since K(a,a)  →    ∞   as a  →  ∂U (see [\cite=Koba]), we can prove the following lemmas in the same way as in [\cite=Eng].

A sequence {ka} converges to 0 weakly in L2a(U) as a  →  ∂U.

Let {fn} be a sequence of functions in L2a(U) which is weakly convergent to f. Then fn  →  f uniformly on compact subsets of U.

From Lemma [formula] and [formula], we can prove the following theorem.

Let μ be a finite positive Borel measure on U. Then μ is a vanishing Carleson measure for L2a(U) if and only if

[formula]

Boundedness of the Toeplitz operator

In this section, we prove the main theorem.

Let [formula] be a minimal bounded homogeneous domain and μ a positive Borel measure on U. Then the following conditions are all equivalent. (a)  Tμ is a bounded operator on L2a(U). (b)  [formula] is a bounded function on U. (c)  For all p  ≥  1, μ is a Carleson measure for Lpa(U). (d)  (z) is a bounded function on U.

We have already proved [formula] in Theorem [formula]. We will prove [formula] and [formula].

First, we prove [formula]. Since Tμ is a bounded operator, we have

[formula]

where the first equality follows from ().

Next, we prove [formula]. By Lemma [formula], we have

[formula]

We integrate this inequality on B(z,ρ) by μ. Then we have

[formula]

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Therefore we have [formula], so (z) is a bounded function on U.

Finally, we prove [formula]. For f∈L2a(U), we have

[formula]

where we put [formula]. Since [formula], we have Fz∈L1a(U). Moreover, μ is a Carleson measure. Hence, there exists a positive constant Mμ such that

[formula]

By the definition of the Carleson measure, Mμ is independent of z. Therefore, we have

[formula]

by () and (). Moreover, the right hand side is rewritten as [formula], where [formula]. Since P+U is a bounded operator by Theorem [formula], we have

[formula]

Next, we prove Tμf∈O(U). Since Tμf∈L2(U), it is enough to prove [formula] for any [formula]. We see that

[formula]

Note that since

[formula]

the second equality of () follows from Fubini's theorem.

Therefore, Tμ is a bounded operator on L2a(U).

Compactness of the Toeplitz operator

Suppose 1 < p <   ∞   and q is the conjugate exponent of p. It is known that [formula] with equivalent norms and under the integral pairing:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=Zhu3]). To prove this, we use the boundedness of the positive Bergman projection [formula] on [formula]. But, we do not know that P+U is a bounded operator on Lp(U,dV) for p  ≠  2, whereas the similar statement is shown for homogeneous Siegel domain by Békollé-Kagou. Therefore, we consider the case p = 2 in the present work.

Let U be a minimal bounded homogeneous domain and μ a finite positive Borel measure on U. Then the following conditions are all equivalent. (a)  Tμ is a compact operator on L2a(U). (b)  [formula] as z  →  ∂U. (c)  μ is a vanishing Carleson measure for L2a(U). (d)  (z)  →  0 as z  →  ∂U.

Theorem [formula] shows [formula]. We will prove [formula] and [formula].

First, we prove that [formula]. By Lemma [formula], we have kz  →  0 weakly in L2a(U) as z  →  ∂U. Since Tμ is a compact operator, we have Tμkz  →  0 in L2a(U). Therefore, we have

[formula]

Next, we prove [formula]. We have already shown that

[formula]

in the proof of Theorem [formula]. Therefore, we have (z)  →  0 as z  →  ∂U.

Finally, we prove [formula]. First, we prove that [formula] for any f∈L2a(U). Since μ is a Carleson measure, we have Tμf∈L2a(U) by Theorem [formula].

Take any g∈L2a(U). Then, we have

[formula]

Note that we can change the order of integral because () holds for the case g∈L2a(U). Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Next, we prove the compactness of Tμ. Take any sequence {fn} such that fn  →  0 weakly in L2a(U). Since μ is a vanishing Carleson measure for L2a(U), we have fn  →  0 in L2a(U,dμ). Therefore we have [formula] by (). It means that Tμ is a compact operator on L2a(U).
