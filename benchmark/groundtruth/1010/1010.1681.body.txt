Costruction of classic exact solutions for Tricomi equation

Abstract A formula to construct classic exact solutions to Tricomi partial differential equation. The steps to obtain this formula require only elementary resolution of a simple system of first order PDEs.

Keywords second order PDE, fluid dynamics, system of first order partial differential equations.

The (generalized) Tricomi equation is the second order partial differential equation

[formula]

where f(x,y) and a(x) are regular functions. In the case a(x) = x, ([\ref=tricomiPDE]) is the classic Tricomi equation, as described by Prof. Francesco in his work dated 1923 [\cite=tricomi]. The equation is an abstraction of the Euler equation on a 2D fluid motion in the case of a flow speed near the sonic condition. For Tricomi equation some exact solutions formulas exist ([\cite=polyanin] or [\cite=eqworld]), and solutions to some particular boundary values problems are known [\cite=cibrario]. Also, some results about weak solutions are found [\cite=yagdjian].

Let be u  =  ∂xf  =  fx, v  =  ∂yf  =  fy. Then Tricomi equation can be written as a system of two first order equations:

[formula]

We define, for convenience reasons, a function t  =  t(x,y)  =  v(x,y). From the first equation we can write

[formula]

where [formula] and g is an arbitrary function of real variable. Now we have to find the condition that g and t must satisfy to verify the second equation of the system ([\ref=systemTricomi]). This equation is now, from the usual rule of derivation of integrals depending on parameters,

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

with [formula]. But g must depend only on y: using the Fundamental Theorem of the Integral Calculus we have

[formula]

If t is a solution of Tricomi equation ([\ref=tricomiPDE]), previous condition is verified. Note that, integrating with respect to y in g(y) formula, the expression for u becomes

[formula]

So, we have found that if t is a solution of Tricomi equation, then a function f such that fx  =  u and fy  =  t, with u given by ([\ref=u_second]), is a solution too. Hence, from fy  =  t we can write

[formula]

where h is an arbitrary function of real variable. From fx  =  u follows

[formula]

so that

[formula]

We have so proven that if t = t(x,y) is a generic solution of Tricomi equation, then the following formula gives a solution of the same equation too:

[formula]

For a-posteriori verification, let be t such that txx + a(x)tyy = 0. We have

[formula]

so the solving formula ([\ref=formulaSolution]) is verified.

Example 1. Let be fxx  +  xfyy  =  0 the original Tricomi equation. Note that t(x,y)  =  y is a (trivial) solution. Then, from ([\ref=formulaSolution]) with a = b = 0, the function

[formula]

is a solution too.

Example 2. Let be [formula] a generalized Tricomi equation. Note that t(x,y)  =  y is a (trivial) solution. Then, from ([\ref=formulaSolution]) with a = b = 0, the function

[formula]

is a solution too.

Note that formula ([\ref=formulaSolution]) can be used as a solutions machine: starting from the most simple not null solution, that is from t(x,y)  =  1, it can be used for iterative construction of solutions.

Also, formula ([\ref=formulaSolution]) can be used to find solutions to some particular boundary values problems for Tricomi equation. For example, in the case a(x) = x and b = 0, if the function t(x,y) is such that ty(x,0) = 0 [formula] (condition satisfied e.g. by [formula]), then from ([\ref=formulaSolution]) follows

[formula]

so that f(x,0) = 0 [formula]. Hence, if ty(x,0) = 0 [formula], then [formula] is a solution of the boundary values differential problem

[formula]

If t is a solution of ([\ref=tricomiPDE]) satisfying the boundary conditions t(x,0) = g(x), with g a function of real variable, then from ([\ref=formulaSolution]) follows that fy(x,0) = g(x), that is f is a solution of the problem with Cauchy-Neumann condition
