Abstract

Introduction

The Andrica conjecture [\cite=Andrica] (see also [\cite=Guy] and [\cite=Ribenboim]) states that the inequality:

[formula]

where pn is the n-th prime number, holds for all n. Despite its simplicity it remains unproved. In the Table I we give a few first values of An and in Table II the values of An are sorted in descending order.

We have

[formula]

From this we see that the growth rate of the form dn  =  O(pθn) with θ < 1 / 2 will suffice for the proof of ([\ref=Andrica-ineq]). Unfortunately all values of θ proved in the past are larger than 1 / 2. A few results with θ closest to 1/2 are: M. Huxley: θ > 7 / 12 [\cite=Huxley], the result of C.J. Mozzochi [\cite=Mozzochi1986] [formula], S. Lou and Q. Yao obtained θ = 6 / 11 [\cite=Lou1992] and recently R.C. Baker G. Harman and J. Pintz [\cite=Baker-et-al] have improved it to θ = 21 / 40 what remains currently the best unconditional result. For a review of results on θ see [\cite=Pintz-Landau]. The best estimation for dn obtained by H. Cramer under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis [\cite=Cramer1920]

[formula]

also does not suffice to prove the Andrica conjecture.

TABLE I

For twins primes pn + 1 = pn + 2 there is no problem with ([\ref=Andrica-ineq]) and in general for short gaps dn = pn + 1  -  pn between consecutive primes the inequality ([\ref=Andrica-ineq]) will be satisfied. The Andrica conjecture can be violated only by extremely large gaps between consecutive primes. Let G(x) denote the largest gap between consecutive primes smaller than x:

[formula]

Let us denote the pair of primes < x comprising the largest gap G(x) by pL + 1(x) and pL(x), hence we have

[formula]

Thus we will concentrate on the values of the difference appearing in ([\ref=Andrica-ineq]) corresponding to the largest gaps and let us introduce the function:

[formula]

Then we have:

[formula]

The largest values of An will be reached at the largest gaps G(x) between consecutive primes below a given bound x. In [\cite=Borcherds-Krakow], [\cite=Wolf-conj] we have given the heuristic arguments that G(x) can be expressed directly by π(x) -- the number of primes < x:

[formula]

where c' is expressed by the twin constant C2:

[formula]

For the Gauss approximation π(x)  ~  x /  log (x) the following dependence follows:

[formula]

and for large x it passes into the Cramer [\cite=Cramer] conjecture:

[formula]

TABLE II

A. Granville argued [\cite=Granville] that the actual G(x) can be larger than that given by ([\ref=eCramer]), namely he claims that there are infinitely many pairs of primes pn,pn + 1 for which:

[formula]

For a given gap d the largest value of the difference [formula] will appear at the first appearance of this gap: each next pair (p',p' + d) of consecutive primes separated by d will produce smaller difference (see ([\ref=nierownosc])):

[formula]

Hence we have to focus our attention on the first occurrences of gaps. In [\cite=Wolf-first-d] we have given heuristic arguments that the gap d should appear for the first time after the prime pf(d) given by

[formula]

We calculate

[formula]

Substituting here for d the maximal gap G(x) given by ([\ref=G-max]) we obtain the approximate formula for R(x):

[formula]

The comparison with real data is given in Figure 1. The lists of known maximal gaps between consecutive primes can be found at http://www.trnicely.net and http://www.ieeta.pt/~  tos/gaps.html. The largest known gap 1476 between consecutive primes follows the prime [formula].

The maximum of the function [formula] is reached at x = 9 and has the value 0.579709161122. The maximal value of An is [formula] for d = 4 and second value is [formula] for d = 14. Let us remark that d = 9 is exactly in the middle between 4 and 14.

Because in ([\ref=main-formula]) R(x) contains exponential of [formula] it is very sensitive to the form of G(x). The substitution G(x) =  log 2(x) leads to the form:

[formula]

This form of R(x) is plotted in Fig.2 in red. In [\cite=Shanks1964] D. Shanks has given for pf(d) the expression

[formula]

This leads to the expression

[formula]

instead of ([\ref=wykladki]). Substitution here for d the form ([\ref=d_max2]) leads to the curve plotted in Fig.2 in green.

Finally let us remark, that from the above analysis it follows, that

[formula]

The above limit was mentioned on p. 61 in [\cite=Golomb1976] as a difficult problem (yet unsolved).
