The substellar mass function in the central region of the open cluster Praesepe from deep LBT observations

Introduction

The mass functions (MFs) of stellar and substellar populations have been determined from optical and near-infrared surveys for several open clusters at different ages, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster, σ Orionis, ρ Ophiuchi, Taurus, IC 348, IC 2391, M35, the Pleiades, and the Hyades. Studies of relatively old open clusters (age >   100 Myr) are important for the following two reasons in particular: first, they allow us to study the intrinsic evolution of basic properties of BDs, e.g. luminosity and effective temperature, and to compare the evolution with structural and atmospheric models; second, we may investigate how the BD and low-mass star populations as a whole evolve, e.g. the efficiency with which BDs and low-mass stars evaporate from clusters. Such an investigation has been carried out for the Hyades [\citep=bouvier2008] and for Praesepe [\citep=boudreault2010].

[\citet=boudreault2010] observed a significant difference between the MFs of Praesepe and Hyades: While the Hyades MF is observed to have a maximum at ~  0.6 M[formula] [\citep=bouvier2008], the MF of Praesepe continues to rise from 0.8 M[formula] down to 0.1 M[formula]. This is surprising, as both clusters share similar physical properties (ages, mass, metallicity, and tidal radii). Disagreement between the Praesepe and Hyades MFs could arise from variations in the clusters' initial MFs, or from differences in their dynamical evolution [\citep=bastian2010]. Although different binary fractions could cause the observed (system) MFs to differ, there is no clear evidence for varying binary fractions from measurements published in the literature (B2010).

Observations and analysis

The Large Binocular Cameras (LBCs) are two wide-field, high-throughput imaging cameras, namely Blue (LBCB) and Red (LBCR), located at the prime focus stations of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Each LBC has a wide field of view (23'×  23'), with four CCD detectors of 2048×  4608 pixels each, providing images with a sampling of 0.23arcsec/pixel. The optical design and detectors of the two cameras are optimized for different wavelength ranges: one for ultraviolet-blue wavelengths (including the Bessel U, B, V and Sloan g and r bands), and one for the red-infrared bands (including the Sloan i, z and Fan Y bands). In the full binocular configuration, both cameras are available simultaneously, and both point in the same direction of the sky, thus doubling the net efficiency of the LBT. The survey was carried out with the r filter using LBC-blue and the izY filters using LBC-red, covering the central 0.59 deg2 area of Praesepe.

The standard data reduction steps for the LBT data were performed using the IDL astronomy package and IRAF. An astrometric solution was achieved using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue as a reference. The root mean square accuracy of our astrometric solution is 0.10-0.15 arcsec. To correct for Earth atmospheric absorption on the photometry, we calibrated the infrared data using the r, i and z band values of SDSS objects which were observed in the science fields. In order to calibrate our Y band photometry, we used our LBT i and z photometry and the Y band photometry from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS).

Candidate Selection Procedure and mass determination

The candidate selection procedure and the mass determination introduced by [\citet=boudreault2009] and B2010 were adopted in the present work. We use the evolutionary tracks from [\citep=chabrier2000] and the atmosphere models from [\citep=allard01] assuming a dusty atmosphere (the AMES-Dusty model), to compute an isochrone for Praesepe using an age of 590+ 150- 120 Myr, a distance of 190+ 6.0- 5.8 pc, a solar metallicity and we neglecting the reddening.

Candidate Selection using colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams

Candidates were first selected from our CMD by keeping all objects which are no more than 0.28 mag redder or bluer than the isochrones in all CMDs. This number accommodates errors in the magnitudes and uncertainties in the model isochrones. We also include the errors from age and distance of Praesepe. We additionally include objects brighter than the isochrones by 0.753 mag in order to include unresolved binaries. In Figure [\ref=fig:cmd-iz] (left) we show the CMD where candidates were selected based on z vs. i-z.

The second stage of candidate selection involves retaining just those objects which lie within 0.28 mag of the isochrone in the colour-colour diagram. This value reflects the photometric errors and uncertainties in the model isochrones. In addition, we also include the uncertainty in the age estimation of Praesepe. The colour-colour diagram with the selection limits is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:cmd-iz] (right), with the theoretical colours for red giants using the atmosphere models of [\citet=hauschildt1999b] and theoretical colours of six galaxies with redshift from 0 to 2 from K. Meisenheimer et al. ( in prep. ) overplotted. Neither the red giants nor the galaxies are expected to be a significant source of contamination; most of the low redshift galaxies can be easily rejected through visual inspection. As these are the dominant potential contaminators, we conclude that there is no significant contamination of non-Praesepe members in our sample (Praesepe is at a Galactic latitude of [formula]).

Observed magnitude vs. predicted magnitude

Our determination of Teff is based on the spectral energy distribution of each object and is independent of the assumed distance. The membership status of an object can therefore be assessed by comparing its observed magnitude in a band with its magnitude predicted from its Teff and the Praesepe's isochrone (which assumes a distance and an age). This selection step is only a verification of the consistency between the physical parameters obtained of the photometric cluster candidates with the physical properties assume for the cluster itself when computing the isochrones. In order to avoid removing unresolved binaries that are real members of the cluster, we keep all objects with a computed magnitude of up to 0.753 mag brighter than the observed magnitude. This selection procedure is illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:mj_vs_mj].

Results

Selected photometric candidates

62 photometric candidates survive the selection procedures (based on isochrones assuming dusty atmospheres). This corresponds to ~   105 objects per square degree. Our survey saturation occurs at ~   18 mag in z band, corresponding to ~  100 MJup. Therefore, most of the low mass candidates discovered in previous surveys (e.g. [\citealt=pinfield97], [\citealt=hambly1995]) saturate in our LBT images. Only a few faint BDs classified by [\citet=pinfield97], [\citet=gonzalez-garcia2006] and by B2010 are rediscovered by the current survey.

There are also some targets which are previously identified as cluster members but rejected by our selection procedures or visual inspection. For example, ten candidates identified by B2010 are detected (not saturated) in our LBT survey, but six of them are rejected by the z vs. i-z CMD, because they are bluer than the isochrones area. Another one is obviously not a point-like source in the LBT image, and another is rejected because its observed J magnitude is not consistent with its model-predicted magnitude. Only the remaining two targets are confirmed to be cluster dwarf stars. As the current work employed more photometric bands than B2010 did, it is not surprising that we achieve a more conservative selection.

Most of our candidates are in the substellar regime, and other than these ten, no other accurate photometric observations are available from past epochs. This precludes using proper motions as a mean of cluster membership assessment at this time.

Contamination by non-members

As mentioned before, the two main sources of contamination are the background red giants and unresolved galaxies. Red giants occupy the high mass end of this study, as seen in the i - J vs. [formula] diagram. Although some types of galaxies share similar colours with Praesepe cluster members more massive than 60 MJup, such low-redshift galaxies are in general extended sources and therefore easily rejected by our visual inspection. Among the 74 candidates that passed our selection procedures, we identify four as galaxies through their LBT images. Other possible sources are field L dwarfs and high redshift quasars (for instance at z  ~  6; [\citealt=caballero2008]). However, as such quasars have spectral energy distributions similar to mid-T dwarfs whereas our faintest candidates have colours of early L dwarfs, and given that they are rare (0.25 quasars at 5.5 < z < 6.5 in a 0.59 deg2 survey, [\citealt=stern2007]), the MF should not be affected by quasar contamination.

The contamination by L dwarfs is also unimportant. [\citet=caballero2008] have collected possible field dwarf contaminants covering spectral type from M3 to T8 from the literature. From their Table 3, the spatial density for L dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood is [formula] pc- 3. Given that Praesepe has a Galactic latitude of + 32.5 deg and distance of 190 pc, the nearby spatial density of L dwarfs Praesepe should be [formula] pc- 3, assuming an exponential decrease for stellar density perpendicular to the Galactic disk and a scale height of 500 pc. If we define a volume corresponding the area of our survey, and use the distance uncertainties to the cluster as its depth, the total volume is [formula] pc3. Therefore, we estimate that we have ~  0.5 L dwarf contaminants near the cluster, which amounts to a negligible contamination of merely 0.7%. A similar calculation shows that we would have ~  4 M dwarf contaminants, about 6%.

We conclude that various contaminants are not important for this study and the MF we derive for Praesepe should be accurate.

Mass function of very low mass and substellar population of Praesepe

The mass function, ξ(log10M), we present here is the total number of objects per square degree in each logarithmic mass interval log10M to log10M + 0.1, Since we do not make any corrections for binaries, we compute here a system MF.

Our optical photometry reaches lower masses than the NIR photometry that we used. To compute the MF of Praesepe to the lowest mass bin, we first computed a MF using only the optical iz photometry. This MF is presented on Fig. [\ref=fig:mf-prae-us] as filled dots. We computed a second MF from the list of candidates that pass the three selections criteria which are also detected in the survey of B2010 in the NIR J and [formula] bands (presented on Fig. [\ref=fig:mf-prae-us] as filled triangles). For each mass bin, we computed the number of object removed because of adding the J and [formula] filters to our selection process and mass determination (plotted as a function of mass in Fig. [\ref=fig:mf-prae-us], top panel). We fitted a linear function to estimate the number of objects that would be removed if we had additional J and [formula] photometry down to 40-45 MJup. The corresponding extension of the MF with [formula] photometry is given as a large triangle on Fig. [\ref=fig:mf-prae-us].

Our derived MF of Praesepe (presented in Fig. 3) shows a rise from 105 MJup to 60 MJup and then a turn-over at ~  60 MJ. We note that in the second mass bin at [formula], the MF is very low. This is probably because at this mass we reach the 5σ detection limit of the J-band of our Ω2k photometry, so we suspect this is not a real feature. However, the turn-over at ~  60 MJup occurs well above the 5σ of either iz bands or [formula] bands (e.g., at ~  60 MJup, [formula], completenss[formula]%) and therefore should not be caused by incompleteness. This is the first time one observes a clear rise in the substellar MF in old open cluster.

We collected some results for other clusters for comparisons, as plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:all-mf]. This includes: IC 2391 by [\citep=boudreault2009], ONC by [\citep=hillenbrand2000], σ Orionis by [\citep=bihain2009] and the Hyades from [\citep=bouvier2008]. The MF of Praesepe is quite different from either IC 2391 ( age of [formula] Myr) or the Hyades (~  625 Myr). Either the 'dynamical evaporation' does not have the same effect on those three clusters, or they have a different initial mass function. Another alternative possibility is that Praesepe has a different binary fraction. Further studies would be necessary to clarify these points.

The continuing rise of the MF into the substellar regime which we observe has also been observed in young clusters (as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:all-mf]), specifically in σ Orionis [\citep=bihain2009], Trapezium [\citep=muench2002], ρ Oph [\citep=marsh2010] and in the very low luminosity young cluster in S106, where the MF increases or at least remains flat down to ~  10 MJup [\citep=oasa2006]. If we assumed a universal IMF, then it seems that the substellar MF of Praesepe has not evolve significantly since it the cluster formed.

Conclusions

We have carried out the deepest survey to date of the open cluster Praesepe, covering the central 0.59 deg2 in the rizY bands. The survey probed a mass range from ~  100 to 40MJup at 5σ detection limit. Our iz-bands data, combined with the Ω2k NIR (J & Ks) band observations from B2010, are compared with theoretical loci of cluster members based on a dusty atmosphere (the AMES-Dusty model), in order to clarify cluster member candidates. Our final sample comprises 62 photometric candidates. We estimate the contamination by field L dwarfs to be less than 1%, and that by galaxies and red giants also to be negligible. About two thirds of our candidates have theoretical masses below the Hydrogen-burning limit at 0.072 [formula], and are therefore BD candidates.

The mass function we have inferred for Praesepe is consistent with that inferred by B2010 at a mass just below the substellar boundary, but deviates by ~  0.4 dex in the next lowest mass bin, which may indicate either a significant number of objects missing in the Boudreault et al. 2010 survey, or a higher concentration of substellar objects in the centre of Praesepe (as the Boudreault et al. survey is at a larger cluster radius). The latter possibility suggests that the dynamical evolution of very low mass stars is not efficient in this cluster, as proposed by B2010, for explaining the discrepancy between the Praesepe MF and Hyades MF.

The steady rise of the Praesepe MF until ~  60 MJup was unexpected. Such a significant peak has never been observed in any other cluster older than 50 Myr, but has been observed in several very young open clusters such as σ Orionis or clusters in star forming regions (e.g. Trapezium). This suggests that the dynamical interactions in Praesepe have very little effect on MFs, if we assume there is a universal initial MF.

The results reported here will be presented with further details in an future publication submitted to A&A (Wang et al. 2010, submitted).
