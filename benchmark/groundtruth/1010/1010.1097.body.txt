The general behavior of NLO unintegrated parton distributions based on the single-scale evolution and the angular ordering constraint

INTRODUCTION

To understand the event structure observed in different laboratories i.e. SLAC, HERA, DESY etc, and especially the one would be expected in LHC (CERN), the theoretical formalisms which describe the small x (x is Bejorken variable) region are vital. The main unknown parameters in these models are the unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF) [\cite=3a] [\cite=3b] [\cite=3c] [\cite=3d]. The UPDF are two-scales dependent distributions which are functions of x (longitudinal momentum fraction of the parent hadron) and the scales k2t and μ2, the squared transverse momentum of the parton and the factorization scale, respectively. As we pointed out these distributions are the essential ingredients for the less exclusive phenomenological computations in the high energy collisions of particle physics.

It is well known that in the region of high energy and moderate momentum transfer i.e. small x, the collinear factorization theorem i.e. Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) [\cite=5a] [\cite=5b] [\cite=5c] [\cite=5d] evolution, breaks down. This happens because of the large increase of the phase space available for the gluon emissions (i.e. a rapid rise in the gluon density), which makes the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative expansions unjustified and one can not obtain the UPDF. On the other hand, at above high energy limit, the cross section can be predicted by using the kt factorization and the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Liptov (BFKL) [\cite=bfkl1] [\cite=bfkl2] [\cite=bfkl3] evolution. But the precision of kt factorization is not good e.g. the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to BFKL are very large [\cite=bfkl4] [\cite=bfkl5] [\cite=bfkl6] [\cite=bfkl7]. Another approach to derive the UPDF is the Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) equations [\cite=1a] [\cite=1b] [\cite=1c] [\cite=1d] [\cite=1e]. Although the CCFM equations describe the evolution of the UPDF correctly, but working in this framework is a complicated task, so practically they are used only in the Monte Carlo event generators [\cite=2b] [\cite=2c] [\cite=2d] [\cite=2e] [\cite=2f]. On the other hand, up to now, there is not a complete quark version for these kind of equations [\cite=1a] [\cite=1b] [\cite=1c] [\cite=1d] [\cite=1e] [\cite=webber], since the enhanced terms that are resumed by CCFM come from gluon evolution. However, to over come this problem, it has been shown that the CCFM equation can be reformulated (the linked dipole chain model) by reducing the division between the initial and the final state radiation diagrams using the colour dipole cascade model [\cite=LDCM1] [\cite=LDCM2] [\cite=Artem].

The Kimber, Martin and Ryskin (KMR) [\cite=4] approach is an alternative prescription for producing the UPDF which is based on the standard DGLAP equations [\cite=5a] [\cite=5b] [\cite=5c] [\cite=5d],

[formula]

where a(x,μ2) = xq(x,μ2) or xg(x,μ2) and Paa'(z) are the conventional (integrated) parton distribution functions (PDF) and the well known DGLAP splitting functions, respectively. In equation ([\ref=1]) the symbol [formula] denotes a convolution as,

[formula]

In this approach under the certain approximation the UPDF are obtained from the PDF by introducing the scale μ only in the last step of evolution with the inclusion of angular ordering constraint (AOC). It has been shown that the KMR prescription gives the same results both for the DGLAP and the unified BFKL-DGLAP equations [\cite=4p] and the AOC is applicable to all orders as in the CCFM formalism, i.e. all the loops contributions via the chain of evolution which are restricted by AOC, are resumed.

In this work, along the lines of our recent calculations [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b], we intend to use the KMR prescription with MSTW2008 [\cite=9] PDF to produce three dimensional plots of UPDF at different energies (μ) and discussed the various behavior of UPDF i.e. f(x,kt,μ) . So the paper is organized as follows: In section II we briefly introduce the KMR formalism and finally, section III is devoted to the results and the discussions concerning the three dimensional (3D) graphs of the UPDF produced via this approach.

The KMR formalism [\cite=4]

The KMR prescription [\cite=4] works as a machine that by taking a defined PDF as inputs, generates UPDF, as outputs. Using the leading order (LO) splitting functions, Paa', the DGLAP equations can be written in a modified form as [\cite=4],

[formula]

where Δ is a cutoff to prevent z = 1 singularities in the splitting functions arising from the soft gluon emission. In the conventional DGLAP formalism, Δ = 0 and the singularities are canceled by the virtual terms. The value of Δ can be determined by imposing an appropriate dynamical condition which is replaced by the angular ordering constraint arising from the coherency of the gluon emissions [\cite=6a] [\cite=6b],

[formula]

where θ's are the radiation angels. This condition, at the final step of evolution, leads to [\cite=1a] [\cite=1b] [\cite=1c] [\cite=1d] [\cite=4p],

[formula]

The first part of the equation ([\ref=3]), shows the contribution of real emissions, that can change the transverse momentum kt. The second term expresses the evolutions due to the virtual effects without changing the kt. The latter can be re-summed, to obtain a survival probability factor,

[formula]

Now, similar to the Sudakov form factor, the above survival probability, equation ({[\ref=6]), is imposed into the equation ([\ref=1]), and by using equation ([\ref=2]), we find the equation which describes the UPDF,

[formula]

More explicit forms of the above equation for the gluon g and the different quark flavors q = u,d,s,... are as follows,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The key observation here is the dependency on the scale μ2, which appears at the last step of the evolution. Another point is that, the Sudakov form factor which arises from the resumption of virtual effects, can be used at every order of approximation. Although the splitting functions must be used at the NLO level, but as it is shown in [\cite=37], the NLO corrections to the splitting functions, are relatively small in comparison to the LO contributions. However, as stated above, only the LO splitting functions are used. On the other hand, although the definition of Sudakov form factor (like the PDF themselves) has been started intuitively from a probabilistic interpretation, but its role in the mathematical description of the evolution remains in the equations.

The primary computations based on this kind of approach to evaluate the UPDF, show very good agreement with the experimental data for F2 [\cite=4]. Also, in recent years, the KMR prescription have been widely used for phenomenological calculations (see [\cite=8a] and the references therein). Recently the stability and the reliability of the KMR  UPDF have been investigated in [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b].

Finally, we should mention here that, the key property of the CCFM approach (as given in their publications [\cite=1a] [\cite=1b] [\cite=1c] [\cite=1d] [\cite=1e] [\cite=2b] [\cite=2c]) is the AOC, which in turn has root in the coherency of gluon radiation along the evolution chain, that is valid for whole range of x values. In the conventional DGLAP formalism, the strong ordering constraint on the transverse momenta, restricts the domain of study to the large and moderate values of x:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

So to obtain the DGLAP equations with [formula], x should not be very low. In the KMR prescription the AOC property of the CCFM formalism is applied to modified DGLAP evolution as a cut off on the integrals. Therefore, the results of these modifications show that the effect of application of AOC is even more important than the inclusion of the conventional low x effects in the BFKL approach [\cite=4].

Results and discussion

As we stated in the section II, by using the equations ([\ref=8]) and ([\ref=9]), the UPDF are generated via the KMR procedure. For the input PDF, the MSTW2008 [\cite=9] set of partons at the NLO level are used . Since the generated UPDF (fa(x,k2t,μ2)) are three variable functions, by fixing the scale μ2, their values versus x and k2t are plotted in the various panels of figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the gluons, the up, the strange and the bottom quarks, respectively. For the better comparison, the values of the μ2 are chosen in a wide range μ2 = 10,102,104,108 GeV2 which is up to the LHC working scales. The three typical quark flavors, the u quarks consists of the valence and the sea contributions u = uv + usea and the s and the b quarks which are completely sea distributions, are presented. The main feature of these figures is exhibiting the general behavior of the UPDF with respect to the coupled contributions of x and k2t. For example, the most probable value of k2t (x) at every x (k2t) for any kind of partons can be checked. As it can be seen, by increasing the scale μ2 the graphs are shifted to the higher k2t. This is expected, since the probability of finding partons with larger k2t is more probable at higher scales. The growth of the values of the distributions by increasing μ2 and decreasing x and also the phenomenon of converging the quark distributions to a unique value at small x are known characteristics of the parton distributions which are the heritage of their parent PDF. The different behaviors of up and strange quarks at large x have root in the valence contribution in the case of up quark. The pronounced peaks become wider with respect to k2t, and move to higher values of k2t. This behavior is much effective for the up, the strange and the bottom quarks. The peaks come from the concept of distributions and they are results of the dynamical evolution of partons. The figures show that at given values of hard scale and x, at which kt, it is more probable to detect the out going partons. So based on the final partons, we can predict the dynamical properties of the produced jets and their components, and on the other hand it can inform us about the precision of the current theoretical formalisms itself. The input PDF of MSTW2008 are also given in the figure 5, for comparison. With good approximation by integrating over UPDF, we can get the input MSTW2008 PDF ([formula]). For example for gluons, at x = 0.01 and μ2 = 100 we get 6.7 whereas MSTW2008 gives the value of 6.5 i.e. 3% off. Situations are the same for other points and parton distributions. It is worth to say that in the original KMR work, they get 25% discrepancies [\cite=4] for above comparison. This is also evident by comparison of figure 5 with those of 1 to 4 i.e. the UPDF are decreasing by increasing x. On the other hand, as have been discussed in the KMR and other related works, because of the imposition of angular ordering, the UPDF have values for k2t  ≥  μ2 as x decreases. But this will not affect the above integration too much. The figures 1 to 4 also show that, for low scales (μ2≃10 GeV2) the UPDF become negative when x becomes close to one. This reflects the negative values of MSTW2008 gluon distributions at the NLO level and beyond that. So the negative values of UPDF have root in the parent integrated gluon distributions which in turn are the result of MSTW2008 assumptions [\cite=9]. As it was pointed, in the MSTW2008 [\cite=9], for better data fitting it is allowed that, the gluon distribution takes negative values, because there is no theorem that imposes positivity condition on PDF beyond the LO approximation. So they become negative in order to fit the data (in other words they can be traced to the slow evolution of F2 at small x and Q2 i.e. a positive gluon would give too rapid evolution to fit the dF2 / d ln (Q2) data. Then in the KMR integrals, the evaluation of input g(x,k2t) at small x and kt (as a scale, instead of Q2 in g(x,Q2)) leads to the negative values for the output UPDF. Finally, (i) the comparison of UPDF produced from different PDF sets have been made in our former works [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b] . The different parameterizations procedures lead to different PDF, and a discussion about these procedures is presented in [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b] and references therein. (ii) The differences between the LO and the NLO PDF are parameterizations dependent. In the MSTW2008 this is noticeable, but in some other parameterizations sets based on different assumptions and procedures it can be less (e.g GRV sets [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b]), but as we have showed in [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b] (by investigating the ratios of KMR UPDF compared to the corresponding ratios of input PDF) the relative differences are less in the output UPDF and the KMR prescription suppresses these discrepancies. To show this point more transparently, in figure 6 we have plotted the gluon UPDF with three different input PDF, namely the original KMR [\cite=4] with MRST99 [\cite=99] PDF, our recent works [\cite=8a] [\cite=8b] with GJR08 PDF [\cite=GRV] and present calculation (MRST2008) at μ2 = 100 GeV2 and x = 0.1,0.01,0.001 and 0.0001 in terms of k2t. It is clearly seen that different input PDF give very similar UPDF. (iii) In fact a complete prescription for producing the NLO UPDF needs to include both the PDF and the splitting functions at the NLO level. This prescription is presented in [\cite=37], but as it is shown in this reference [\cite=37], inclusion of the NLO splitting functions have very low effect comparing to the contribution of the NLO PDF. Therefore, ignoring the corrections due to the NLO splitting functions do not affect our analysis of the general behavior of the NLO UPDF. (iv) There is no restriction on the kt dependency. As the orders of the approximation are in terms of orders of αs(k2t), the NLO accuracy is contained in the NLO PDF and splitting functions that discussed in the former comments. Hence at scales k2t  ≥  Q20 ,where Q20 is the scale that upper than it, the perturbative QCD is still applicable, these results are valid.
