Abstract. Bouvel and Pergola introduced the notion of minimal permutations in the study of the whole genome duplication-random loss model for genome rearrangements. Let Fd(n) denote the set of minimal permutations of length n with d descents, and let fd(n) = |Fd(n)|. They derived that fn - 2(n) = 2n - (n - 1)n - 2 and fn(2n) = Cn, where Cn is the n-th Catalan number. Mansour and Yan proved that fn + 1(2n + 1) = 2n - 2nCn + 1. In this paper, we consider the problem of counting minimal permutations in Fd(n) with a prescribed set of ascents. We show that such structures are in one-to-one correspondence with a class of skew Young tableaux, which we call 2-regular skew tableaux. Using the determinantal formula for the number of skew Young tableaux of a given shape, we find an explicit formula for fn - 3(n). Furthermore, by using the Knuth equivalence, we give a combinatorial interpretation of a formula for a refinement of the number fn + 1(2n + 1).

Introduction

The notion of minimal permutations was introduced by Bouvel and Pergola in the study of genome evolution, see [\cite=bou]. Such permutations are a basis of permutations that can be obtained from the identity permutation via a given number of steps in the duplication-random loss model. Let [formula] be a permutation. A duplication of π means the duplication of a fragment of consecutive elements of π in such a way that the duplicated fragment is put immediately after the original fragment. Suppose that [formula] is the fragment for duplication, then the duplicated sequence is

[formula]

A random loss means to randomly delete one occurrence of each repeated element πk for i  ≤  k  ≤  j, so that we get a permutation again. In the following example, the fragment 234 is duplicated, and the underlined elements are the occurrences of repeated elements that are supposed to be deleted,

[formula]

To describe the notation of minimal permutations, we give an overview of the descent set of a permutation and the patterns of subsequences of a permutation. Let Sn be the set of permutations on [formula], where n  ≥  1. In a permutation [formula], a descent is a position i such that i  ≤  n - 1 and πi  >  πi + 1, whereas an ascent is a position i with i  ≤  n - 1 and πi  <  πi + 1. For example, the permutation 3145726∈S7 has two descents 1 and 5 and has four ascents 2,3,4 and 6.

Let [formula] be a set of distinct integers listed in increasing order, namely, [formula]. The standardization of a permutation π on V is the permutation (π) on

[formula]

. Then π is a minimal permutation with d descents if and only if π is a permutation with d descents satisfying the following conditions:

It starts and ends with a descent;

If i is an ascent, that is, πi  <  πi + 1, then [formula] and πi - 1πiπi + 1πi + 2 is of type 2143 or 3142.

Denote by Fd(n) the set of minimal permutations of length n with d descents and fd(n) = |Fd(n)|. Clearly, fd(n) = 0 for all d  ≤  0 or d  ≥  n, and fd(d + 1) = 1 for all d  ≥  1. Bouvel and Pergola proved that fn(2n) equals the n-th Catalan number, that is,

[formula]

and fn - 2(n) is given by the formula

[formula]

Mansour and Yan [\cite=man] have shown that

[formula]

As mentioned by Bouvel and Pergola that it is an open problem to compute fd(n) for other cases of d. In this paper, we consider the enumeration of minimal permutations in Fd(n) with a prescribed set of ascents. We show that such minimal permutations are in one-to-one correspondence with a class of skew Young tableaux, which we call 2-regular skew tableaux. As a result, we may employ the determinant formula for the number of skew Young tableaux of a given shape to compute the number fd(n). With this method, we can unite the known results. Moreover, we derive an explicit formula for fn - 3(n).

For the number fn + 1(2n + 1), we obtain a refined formula from the determinant formula. Moreover, we give a combinatorial interpretation of this formula by using the Knuth equivalence of permutations.

2-Regular skew tableaux

In this section, we establish a connection between the minimal permutations and skew Young tableaux of certain shape. To describe our correspondence, let us give an overview of necessary terminology on Young tableaux as used in Stanley [\cite=sta].

A partition of a positive integer n is defined to be a sequence [formula] of positive integers such that [formula] and [formula]. If λ is a partition of n, we write [formula], or |λ| = n. The Ferrers diagram of a partition λ is a diagram with left-justified rows in which the i-th row consists of λi dots. The conjugate partition λ' of λ is obtained by transposing the Ferrers diagram of λ. The positive terms λi are called the parts of λ, and the number of parts is denoted by l(λ).

A standard Young tableau (SYT) on

[formula]

that is increasing in every row and every column. The number of boxes of the Young diagram of shape λ  /  μ is denoted by |λ  /  μ|. For example, below are an SYT of shape (4,3,3,1) and a skew Young tableau of shape (6,5,2,2) / (3,1):

[formula]

Recall that if |λ  /  μ| = n and l(λ) = r, then the number of skew Young tableaux of shape λ  /  μ is given by

[formula]

see, for example, [\cite=sta].

Let [formula] be a sequence of positive integers such that ai  ≥  2 for all i and [formula]. Let P be a skew Young tableau of size n with column lengths [formula]. We say that P is 2-regular if any two consecutive columns overlap exactly by two rows, namely, for any two consecutive columns there are exactly two rows containing elements in both columns. Denote by [formula] the set of 2-regular skew tableaux with column lengths [formula].

For example, the following skew Young tableau is 2-regular and it belongs to P4,2,5,3,2(16):

[formula]

For a permutation π of length n, a substring of π is a sequence of consecutive elements of π. A maximal decreasing substring of π is defined to be a decreasing substring that is not a substring of another decreasing substring. For example, the permutation 5  2  7  3  1  4  8  9  6 contains five maximal decreasing substrings, namely, 5  2,7  3  1,4,8 and 9  6.

It is clear that any permutation π with k - 1 ascents can be decomposed into k maximal decreasing substrings. To describe the ascent set, we find it convenient to use a sequence [formula] to denote the lengths of the maximal decreasing substrings, and this sequence is called the ascent sequence of π. Then the ascent set π is expressed as [formula].

Given a minimal permutation [formula]. Suppose [formula] is its ascent sequence, then ai  ≥  2 for all i.

Proof. By condition (i) of Theorem [\ref=con], π starts and ends with a descent, this implies that a1  ≥  2 and ak  ≥  2. For each ascent [formula] of π, where 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, the condition (ii) of Theorem [\ref=con] says that πj - 1πjπj + 1πj + 2 is of type 2143 or 3142, which means that both j - 1 and j + 1 are descents. Therefore, π contains no consecutive ascents, and the length of decreasing sequences containing πj - 1πj and πj + 1πj + 2 are least two. This completes the proof.

Let [formula] denote the set of minimal permutations of length n with the ascent sequence [formula], and let [formula]. The following theorem asserts that the number of minimal permutations with a prescribed ascent sequence is equal to the number of skew Young tableaux with fixed column lengths.

Let [formula] be a sequence of positive integers such that [formula] and ai  ≥  2 for all i. Then there exists a bijection between the set [formula] of minimal permutations with ascent sequence [formula] and the set [formula] of 2-regular skew tableaux with column lengths [formula].

Proof. Suppose [formula] is a minimal permutation in [formula]. Let [formula] (0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1 and set a0 = 0) be the k maximal decreasing substrings of π, then the elements in each pi are strictly decreasing. Furthermore, by Theorem [\ref=con], if [formula] is an ascent then πj - 1πjπj + 1πj + 2 is of type 2143 or 3142. Therefore, if we place these four elements into an array as follows,

[formula]

then both its rows and columns are strictly increasing. We next construct a tableau P corresponding to π as follows. Place the elements of each maximal decreasing substring pi in one single column, with the decreasing order from the bottom upward. This guarantees that each column of the tableau P is strictly increasing. Now, for every two adjacent maximal decreasing substrings pi and pi + 1, we assume that the last two elements in pi and the first two elements in pi + 1 are arranged into a 2  ×  2 square as exhibited in [\eqref=ii]. This ensures that each row of P is also strictly increasing. Therefore, P is indeed a 2-regular skew tableau. To be more precise, P has the following form,

[formula]

For example, π  =      4  1  7  3      9  5  2      6    8∈F11(16) contains 5 maximal decreasing substrings. The 2-regular skew tableau corresponding to π is given by the array in [\eqref=ol].

Conversely, given a 2-regular skew tableau P, we write down the elements of P from bottom up and from left to right. Then we obtain a minimal permutation π. Thus we get a bijection.

For example, all the minimal permutations in Fn(2n) have alternating isolated descents as well as alternating isolated ascents. Note that these minimal permutations start and end with descents, see [\cite=bou]. Therefore, the corresponding 2-regular skew tableaux always have straight shape (n,n),

[formula]

As a result, by formula [\eqref=formula], we obtain

[formula]

So far we have established a one-to-one correspondence between the set [formula] and the set of 2-regular skew tableaux in Theorem [\ref=f]. Hence the enumeration of the number of minimal permutations is equivalent to the enumeration of skew Young tableaux.

Given an ascent sequence [formula], where [formula] and ai  ≥  2, for 1  ≤  i  ≤  k, we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof. First of all we need to determine the shape of the 2-regular skew tableau P defined in [\eqref=aa]. Suppose the shape of P is λ  /  μ, by the correspondence described in Theorem [\ref=f], the number of elements in each column of P are [formula] and ak, respectively. In other words,

[formula]

Furthermore, the fact that the uppermost two elements in the ith column and the lowest two elements in the (i + 1)th column compose a 2  ×  2 square leads to

[formula]

Obviously λ'k = ak and μ'k = 0. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1, we have

[formula]

This yields that [formula]. So λ  /  μ is exactly the shape of P. As a consequence,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now we proceed to compute the number of 2-regular skew tableaux by using formula [\eqref=formula]. We consider the shape λ' / μ' of the 2-regular skew tableau P by dividing the relations between i and j into the following cases. From the equations [\eqref=1] and [\eqref=2], we obtain

If j < i - 2, [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. Since am  ≥  2(1  ≤  m  ≤  k), we see that λ'i  -  μj' - i + j < 0, which means Ai,j = 0.

If j = i - 2, λ'i  -  μi - 2' =  - ai - 1 + 4. Therefore, if ai - 1 = 2, then λ'i  -  μi - 2' - i + i  -  2 = 0 and Ai,i - 2 = 1 / 0! = 1. Otherwise, we have ai - 1 > 2, λ'i  -  μi - 2' - i + i  -  2 < 0, and Ai,i - 2 = 0.

If j = i - 1, λ'i  -  μi - 1' = 2. Consequently, λ'i  -  μi - 1' - i + (i - 1) = 1, and Ai,i - 1 = 1.

If j = i, then from the relation [\eqref=1], we have λ'i  -  μi' = ai, and so [formula].

If j  ≥  i - 1, then by [\eqref=2], [formula]. In this case,

[formula]

as desired. This completes the proof.

We remark that Corollary [\ref=g] can be viewed as a refinement of the number fd(n), that is the number of minimal permutations in Fn - k(n) with prescribed ascent set [formula].

We can now compute the number of minimal permutations in Fd(n). Note that such minimal permutations have n - d maximal decreasing substrings.

For d + 1  ≤  n  ≤  2d, we have

[formula]

As an application of the above formula [\eqref=fa] for d = n - 2, we immediately obtain the formula for fn - 2(n) due to Bouvel and Pergola [\cite=bou]. It is obvious that the minimal permutations in Fn - 2(n) have only one ascent, which implies that they have two maximal decreasing substrings. Suppose that the unique ascent is k, and the ascent sequence is (k,n - k) for 2  ≤  k  ≤  n - 2. By Corollary [\ref=g], it is easy to check

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=main2], we arrive at

[formula]

We now come to the computation of fn - 3(n).

The number of minimal permutations of length n with n - 3 descents equals

[formula]

Proof. The minimal permutations in Fn - 3(n) have three maximal decreasing substrings. Suppose the ascent sequence is (a,b,c) such that a + b + c = n and a,b,c  ≥  2. According to Corollary [\ref=g], let

[formula]

and let

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=main2], we obtain

[formula]

In order to simplify the computation, we reformulate the above equation into the following form,

[formula]

It is easy to check that

[formula]

The second sum of [\eqref=n-3] can be expressed as follows

[formula]

On the one hand, by the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have

[formula]

On the other hand, let f(x) denote the coefficient of xn in f(x), then we get

[formula]

Furthermore,

[formula]

It is easily seen that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we find

[formula]

By [\eqref=w], [\eqref=v1], [\eqref=v2] and [\eqref=v3], we finally obtain

[formula]

as claimed.

A refinement of fn + 1(2n + 1) via Knuth equivalence

In this section, we give a combinatorial proof of a refined formula for the number fn + 1(2n + 1). Given a minimal permutation [formula] of length 2n + 1 with n + 1 descents, there are only one occurrence of consecutive descents in π and the other descents are separated by ascents. We shall consider the set of minimal permutations for which the unique consecutive descents are 2i - 1 and 2i.

Let M2n + 1,2i be the subset of Fn + 1(2n + 1) whose unique consecutive descents are 2i - 1 and 2i, where 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. We have

[formula]

We shall give two proofs of this theorem.

It is easy to see that the 2-regular skew tableaux corresponding to minimal permutations π∈M2n + 1,2i are of the following form,

[formula]

The conjugate shape λ' / μ' is

[formula]

Notice that the skew shape λ  /  μ is (n,n,i) / (i - 1). In this context, we can obtain the number of skew Young tableaux directly from formula [\ref=formula],

[formula]

So we immediately get

[formula]

We next give a combinatorial interpretation of Theorem [\ref=mi]. We give an overview of the background on the RSK correspondence and the Knuth equivalence.

Suppose [formula], where P is called the insertion tableau while Q is called the recording tableau. Two permutations are Knuth-equivalent if and only if their insertion tableaux are the same.

The following properties of insertion paths will be useful. Denote by I(P←k) the insertion path of a positive integer k into an SYT (standard Young tableau) P = (Pij) by the RSK algorithm. Then

When we insert k into an SYT P, the insertion path moves to the left. More precisely, if (r,s),(r + 1,t)∈I(P←k) then t  ≤  s.

Let P be an SYT, and let j < k. Then I(P←j) lies strictly to the left of I((P←j)←k). More precisely, if (r,s)∈I(P←j), and (r,t)∈I((P←j)←k), then s < t. Moreover, I((P←j)←k) does not extend below the bottom of I(P←j). Equivalently,

[formula]

See [\cite=sta] for more details.

Now we begin the combinatorial proof by using the Knuth equivalence of permutations in connection with the RSK correspondence between permutations and standard Young tableaux, see Stanley [\cite=sta].

Let T2n + 1,k be the set of standard Young tableaux of size 2n + 1 with shape (n,n + 1 - k,k), where 1  ≤  k  ≤  [null], where
