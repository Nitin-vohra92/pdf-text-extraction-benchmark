Computing α-invariants of singular del Pezzo surfaces

We assume that all varieties are projective, normal, and defined over [formula].

Introduction

Let X be a Fano variety with at most quotient singularities (a Fano orbifold).

If [formula] and X is smooth, then

[formula]

An important role in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Tian] is played by several holomorphic invariants, which are now known as α-invariants. Let us describe their algebraic counterparts.

Let D be an effective [formula]-divisor on the variety X. Then the number

[formula]

is called the log canonical threshold of the divisor D (see [\cite=Ko97]). Put

[formula]

for every [formula]. For small n, the number [formula] is usually not very hard to compute.

If X is a smooth surface in [formula] of degree 3, then

[formula]

The number [formula] is denoted by αn(X) in [\cite=Ti90b].

It follows from [\cite=Mustata02] that the set

[formula]

is finite (cf. [\cite=Lyubeznik]). Thus, there exists a divisor B∈| - nKX| such that [formula].

If the variety X is smooth, then it is proved by Demailly (see [\cite=ChSh08c]) that

[formula]

where α(X) is the α-invariant introduced by Tian in [\cite=Ti87]. Put [formula].

There is an [formula] such that [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:Tian] uses (at least implicitly) the following result.

The Fano orbifold X is Kähler-Einstein if

[formula]

Note that there are many well-known obstructions to the existence of Kähler-Einstein metrics on smooth Fano manifolds and Fano orbifolds (see [\cite=Mat57], [\cite=Fu83], [\cite=GaMaSpaYau06], [\cite=RossThomas]).

If [formula], then X is not Kähler-Einstein (see [\cite=GaMaSpaYau06], [\cite=RossThomas]).

Let us describe one more α-invariant that took its origin in [\cite=Tian90].

Let M be a linear system on the variety X. Then the number

[formula]

is called the log canonical threshold of the linear system M (cf. [\cite=Ko97]). Put

[formula]

for every [formula]. The number [formula] is denoted by αn,2(X) in [\cite=ChenWang09B] and [\cite=Wang10]. Note that

[formula]

and it follows from [\cite=Ko97] that [formula] for every [formula].

It follows from [\cite=Mustata02] and [\cite=Ko97] that the set

[formula]

is finite. Thus, there is a pencil B in | - nKX| such that the equality [formula]. Then

[formula]

if there exists at most finitely many effective [formula]-divisors [formula] on the variety X such that

[formula]

and [formula].

The importance of the number [formula] is due to the following conjecture.

Suppose that

[formula]

for every [formula]. Then X is Kähler-Einstein.

Note that Conjecture [\ref=conjecture:KE-conjecture] is not much stronger than Theorem [\ref=theorem:KE] by ().

Suppose that X is a smooth hypersurface in [formula] of degree [formula]. Then

[formula]

for every [formula] by [\cite=Ch01]. The equality [formula] holds [formula] the hypersurface X contains a cone of dimension m - 2 (see [\cite=Ch01], [\cite=Ch01], [\cite=FEM]). Then

[formula]

by Remark [\ref=remark:lct-lct-n-2], [\cite=Ch01], [\cite=Ch01], [\cite=Ch01] and [\cite=FEM], because X contains at most finitely many cones by [\cite=CoolsCoppens]. If X is general, then

[formula]

by [\cite=Pu04d], [\cite=Ch07b], [\cite=CheltsovParkWon]. Thus, if X is general, then it is Kähler-Eisntein by Theorem [\ref=theorem:KE].

The assertion of Conjecture [\ref=conjecture:KE-conjecture] follows from [\cite=ChenWang09B] and [\cite=Wang10] under an additional assumption that the Kähler-Ricci flow on X is tamed (see [\cite=ChenWang09B] and [\cite=Wang10]).

If [formula], then the Kähler-Ricci flow on X is tamed.

Suppose that [formula] and

[formula]

for every [formula]. Then X is Kähler-Einstein.

Two-dimensional Fano orbifolds are called del Pezzo surfaces.

Del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities are not classified (cf. [\cite=KeelMcKernan]). But

del Pezzo surfaces with canonical singularities are classified (see [\cite=HidakaWatanabe]),

del Pezzo surfaces with 2-Gorenstein quotient singularities are classified (see [\cite=AlexeevNikulin]),

del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank 1 with T-singularities are classified (see [\cite=HackingProkhorov]).

Del Pezzo surfaces with canonical singularities form a very natural class of del Pezzo surfaces.

Describe all Kähler-Einstein del Pezzo surface with canonical singularities.

Recall that if X is a del Pezzo surface with canonical singularities, then

either the inequality [formula] holds,

or one of the following possible cases occurs:

the equality K2X = 1 holds and X is a sextic surface in [formula],

the equality K2X = 2 holds and X is a quartic surface in [formula],

the equality K2X = 3 holds and X is a cubic surface in [formula],

the equality K2X = 4 holds and X is a complete intersection in [formula] of two quadrics.

Let us consider few examples to illustrate the expected answer to Problem [\ref=problem:del-Pezzo].

Suppose that X is a sextic surface in [formula] such that its singular locus consists of singular points of type [formula] or [formula]. Arguing as in the proof of [\cite=Ch07b], we see that

[formula]

for every [formula]. Thus, the surface X is Kähler-Einstein by Corollary [\ref=corollary:Chen-Wang].

Suppose that X is a quartic surface in [formula] such that its singular locus consists of singular points of type [formula] or [formula]. Then X is Kähler-Einstein by [\cite=Kollar-Ghigi].

Suppose that X is a cubic surface in [formula] that is not a cone. Then

if X is smooth, then X is Kähler-Einstein by Theorem [\ref=theorem:Tian],

if [formula] consists of one point of type [formula], then it follows from [\cite=Shi09] that

[formula]

for every [formula], which implies that X is Kähler-Einstein by Corollary [\ref=corollary:Chen-Wang],

if the cubic surface X has a singular point that is not a singular point of type [formula] or [formula], then the surface X is not Kähler-Einstein by [\cite=Ding-Tian92].

Suppose that X is a complete intersection in [formula] of two quadrics. Then

if X is smooth, then X is Kähler-Einstein by Theorem [\ref=theorem:Tian],

if X is Kähler-Einstein, then X has at most singular points of type [formula] (see [\cite=Je97]),

it follows from [\cite=MaMu93] or [\cite=Kollar-Ghigi] that X is Kähler-Einstein if it is given by

[formula]

and X has at most singular points of type [formula], where [formula].

Keeping in mind Examples [\ref=example:degree-one], [\ref=example:degree-two], [\ref=example:Ding-Tian] and [\ref=example:degree-four], [\cite=Ch07c] and [\cite=MiyanishiZhang], it is very natural to expect that the following answer to Problem [\ref=problem:del-Pezzo] is true (cf. Example [\ref=example:P123]).

If the orbifold X is a del Pezzo surface with at most canonical singularities, then the surface X is Kähler-Enstein [formula] it satisfies one of the following conditions:

K2X = 1 and [formula] consists of points of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula],

K2X = 2 and [formula] consists of points of type [formula], [formula] or [formula],

K2X = 3 and [formula] consists of points of type [formula] or [formula],

K2X = 4 and [formula] consists of points of type [formula],

the surface X is smooth and [formula],

either [formula] or [formula].

In this paper, we prove the following result.

Suppose that X is a sextic surface in [formula]. Then

[formula]

for every [formula] if [formula] consists of points of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula].

Suppose that X is a sextic surface in [formula] such that its singular locus consists of singular points of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula]. Then X is Kähler-Enstein.

It should be pointed out that Corollary [\ref=corollary:main] and Examples [\ref=example:degree-one], [\ref=example:degree-two], [\ref=example:Ding-Tian], [\ref=example:degree-four] illustrate a general philosophy that the existence of Kähler-Enstein metrics on Fano orbifolds is related to an algebro-geometric notion of stability (see [\cite=Ding-Tian92], [\cite=Ti97], [\cite=Donaldson]).

If X is a sextic surface in [formula] with canonical singularities, then either

[formula]

or [formula] consists only of points of type [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=Urabe]).

What is known about α-invariants of del Pezzo surfaces with canonical singularities?

If X is a smooth del Pezzo surface, then [formula].

If X is a del Pezzo surface with canonical singularities, then

[formula]

in the case when [formula].

If X is a quartic surface in [formula] with canonical singularities, then

[formula]

In this paper, we prove the following result (cf. Example [\ref=example:degree-one]).

Suppose that X is a sextic surface in [formula] with canonical singularities, let [formula] be a natural double cover, and let R be its branch curve in [formula]. Then

[formula]

It should be pointed out that if X is a del Pezzo surface with at most canonical singularities, then all possible values of the number [formula] are computed in [\cite=Pa01], [\cite=Park2002], [\cite=Park-Won-PEMS].

If X is a sextic surface in [formula] with canonical singularities, then

[formula] [formula] the surface X has a singular point of type [formula],

[formula] [formula] the surface X has a singular point of type [formula],

[formula] [formula] the surface X has a singular point of type [formula],

[formula] [formula] the surface X has a singular point of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula],

[formula] [formula] the following two conditions are satisfied:

the surface X has no singular points of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula],

there is a curve in | - KX| that has a cusp at a point in [formula] of type [formula],

[formula] [formula] the following three conditions are satisfied:

the surface X has no singular points of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula],

there is no curve in | - KX| that has a cusp at a point in [formula] of type [formula],

there is a curve in | - KX| that has a cusp at a point in [formula] of type [formula],

[formula] [formula] the following three conditions are satisfied:

the surface X has no singular points of type [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] or [formula],

there is no curve in | - KX| that have a cusp at a point in [formula],

there is a curve in | - KX| that has a cusp,

[formula] [formula] there are no cuspidal curves in | - KX|.

A crucial role in the proofs of both Theorems [\ref=theorem:main] and [\ref=theorem:auxiliary] is played by a new local inequality that we discovered. This inequality is a technical tool, but let us describe it now.

Let S be a surface, let D be an arbitrary effective [formula]-divisor on the surface S, let O be a smooth point of the surface S, let Δ1 and Δ2 be reduced irreducible curves on S such that

[formula]

and the divisor Δ1  +  Δ2 has a simple normal crossing singularity at the smooth point [formula], let a1 and a2 be some non-negative rational numbers. Suppose that the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at O, but (S,D + a1Δ1 + a2Δ2) is Kawamata log terminal in a punctured neighborhood of the point O.

Let A,B,M,N,α,β be non-negative rational numbers. Then

[formula]

in the case when the following conditions are satisfied:

the inequality [formula] holds,

the inequalities [formula] hold,

the inequalities [formula] and [formula] hold,

either the inequality [formula] holds or

[formula]

Suppose that

[formula]

for some integer m such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

To prove the required assertion, let us put

[formula]

and let us check that all hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:I] are satisfied.

We have [formula] by assumption. We have

[formula]

since [formula]. We have

[formula]

since [formula]. We have [formula] and [formula].

Thus, we see that all hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=theorem:I] are satisfied. Then

[formula]

by Theorem [\ref=theorem:I].

For the convenience of a reader, we organize the paper in the following way:

in Section [\ref=section:preliminaries], we collect auxiliary results,

in Section [\ref=section:main-inequality], we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:I],

in Sections [\ref=section:cyclic-orbifolds], we prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-single-point],

in Sections [\ref=section:non-cyclic-orbifolds], we prove Theorems [\ref=theorem:main-single-point-non-cyclic],

in Sections [\ref=section:orbifolds-with-many-singular-points], we prove Theorems [\ref=theorem:main-many-points].

By Remark [\ref=remark:DP1-SING], both Theorems [\ref=theorem:auxiliary] and [\ref=theorem:main] follow from Theorems [\ref=theorem:main-single-point], [\ref=theorem:main-single-point-non-cyclic] and [\ref=theorem:main-many-points].

Preliminaries

Let S be a surface with canonical singularities, and let D be an effective [formula]-divisor on S. Put

[formula]

where Di is an irreducible curve, and [formula]. We assume that [formula].

Suppose that (S,D) is log canonical, but (S,D) is not Kawamata log terminal.

Let [formula] be an effective [formula]-divisor on the surface S such that

[formula]

and the log pair (S,) is log canonical, where āi is a non-negative rational number. Put

[formula]

where α is well defined and [formula]. Then [formula]. Suppose that D  ≠  . Put

[formula]

and choose [formula] such that α = ak  /  āk. Then [formula] and [formula], but the log pair [formula] is not Kawamata log terminal.

Let [formula] be the locus of log canonical singularities of the log pair (S,D) (see [\cite=ChSh08c]).

If - (KS + D) is nef and big, then [formula] is connected.

Take a point [formula]. Suppose that [formula] contains no curves that pass through P.

Suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

The log pair [formula] is not log canonical at P, since a1 < 1. Then

[formula]

by [\cite=Ko91].

Let π:S̄  →  S be a birational morphism, and [formula] is a proper transform of D via π. Then

[formula]

where Ei is an irreducible π-exceptional curve, and [formula]. We assume that [formula].

Suppose, in addition, that the birational morphism π induces an isomorphism

[formula]

The log pair [formula] is not Kawamata log terminal at a point in [formula].

Suppose that S is singular at P, and either P is a singular point of type [formula] for some [formula], or the point P is a singular point of type [formula] for some m∈{6,7,8}.

Suppose that [formula]. Then e1 = 1 if

[formula]

This follows from [\cite=Pr98plt], because (S∋P) is a weakly-exceptional singularity (see [\cite=Pr98plt], [\cite=ChSh09a], [\cite=ChSh09a]).

Suppose that S is a sextic surface in [formula] that has canonical singularities, and suppose that [formula]. Let μ be a positive rational number such that either

[formula]

or μ = 2 / 3 and D is not a curve in | - KX| with a cusp at a point in [formula] of type [formula]. Then

[formula]

the locus [formula] contains no points of type [formula] or [formula], and [formula].

This follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem:connectedness] and the proof of [\cite=Ch07b].

Most of the described results are valid in much more general settings (cf. [\cite=Ko91] and [\cite=Ko97]).

Local inequality

The purpose of this section is to prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:I].

Let S be a surface, let D be an arbitrary effective [formula]-divisor on the surface S, let O be a smooth point of the surface S, let Δ1 and Δ2 be reduced irreducible curves on S such that

[formula]

and the divisor Δ1  +  Δ2 has a simple normal crossing singularity at the smooth point [formula], let a1 and a2 be some non-negative rational numbers. Suppose that the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at O, but (S,D + a1Δ1 + a2Δ2) is Kawamata log terminal in a punctured neighborhood of the point O. In particular, we must have a1 < 1 and a2 < 1.

Let A,B,M,N,α,β be non-negative rational numbers such that

the inequality [formula] holds,

the inequalities [formula] hold,

the inequalities [formula] and [formula] holds,

either the inequality [formula] holds or

[formula]

The inequalities [formula] and B > 1 holds. The inequality

[formula]

holds. The inequality [formula] holds. The inequalities

[formula]

and [formula] hold.

The inequality B > 1 follows from the inequality [formula]. Then

[formula]

because [formula]. Similarly, we see that [formula], because

[formula]

and [formula]. The inequality [formula] follows from the inequalities

[formula]

because [formula].

Let us show that the inequality

[formula]

holds. Let L1 be the line in [formula] given by the  equation

[formula]

and let L2 be the line that is given by the equation

[formula]

where (x,y) are coordinates on [formula]. Then L1 intersects the line y = 0 at the point

[formula]

and L2 intersects the line y = 0 at the point (A / (1 - M),0). But

[formula]

which implies that [formula] if

[formula]

where (α0,β0) is the intersection point of the  lines L1 and L2. But

[formula]

where Δ = 2AB - ABM - A + AM - 1 + M + NA - NAM + N - NM. But

[formula]

because [formula], which implies that [formula].

Finally, let us show that the inequality

[formula]

holds. Let [formula] be the line in [formula] given by the equation

[formula]

where (x,y) are coordinates on [formula]. Then [formula] intersects the line y = 0 at the point

[formula]

and L2 intersects the line y = 0 at the point (A / (1 - M),0). But

[formula]

which implies that [formula] if

[formula]

where (α1,β1) is the intersection point of the  lines [formula] and L2. Note that

[formula]

where [formula].

To complete the proof, it is enough to show that the inequality

[formula]

holds. This inequality is equivalent to the inequality

[formula]

which is true, because [formula] and [formula].

Let us prove prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:I] by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that the inequalities

[formula]

hold. Let us show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

The inequalities a1 > (1 - M) / A and a2 > (1 - N) / B hold.

It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction] that

[formula]

which implies that a1 > (1 - M) / A. Similarly, we see that a2 > (1 - N) / B.

Put [formula]. Then m0 is a positive rational number.

The inequalities m0 < M + Aa1 - a2 and m0 < N + Ba2 - a1 hold.

The inequality m0 + a1 + a2 < 2 holds.

We know that m0 + a1 + a2 < M + (A + 1)a1 and m0 + a1 + a2 < N + (B + 1)a2. Then

[formula]

which implies that m0 + a1 + a2 < 2 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-0].

Let π1:S1  →  S be the blow up of the point O, and let F1 be the π1-exceptional curve. Then

[formula]

where D1, Δ11, Δ12 are proper transforms of the divisors D, Δ1, Δ2 via π1, respectively. Then

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at some point O1∈F1 (see Remark [\ref=remark:log-pull-back]), where [formula].

Either [formula] or [formula].

Suppose that [formula]. Then m0 = D1  ·  F1 > 1 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction]. But

[formula]

because m0 < M + Aa1 - a2 and m0 < N + Ba2 - a1. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

because [formula] and AB - 1 > 0. But we already proved that m0 > 1. Thus, we see that

[formula]

which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-0].

The inequality [formula] holds.

Suppose that [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction] that

[formula]

which implies that a1 > (2 - M) / (A + 1). Then

[formula]

because a2 > (1 - N) / B by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-1]. Thus, we see that

[formula]

which is impossible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-0].

Therefore, we see that [formula]. Then the  log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at the point O1. We know that [formula].

We have a blow up π1:S1  →  S. For any [formula], consider a sequence of blow ups

[formula]

such that πi + 1:Si + 1  →  Si is a blow up of the  point [formula] for every [formula], where

we denote by Fi the exceptional curve of the morphism πi,

we denote by Δi2 the proper transform of the curve Δ2 on the surface Si.

For every [formula] and for every [formula], let Dk, Δk1 and Fki be the proper transforms on the surface Sk of the divisors D, Δ1 and Fi, respectively. Then

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] for every [formula]. Then the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at some point of the set [formula] (see Remark [\ref=remark:log-pull-back]).

Put [formula] for every [formula].

For every [formula], we have

[formula]

and () is Kawamata log terminal at every point of the set [formula].

Since [formula] by assumption, it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-inductive] that

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. On the other hand, the assertion of Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-inductive] holds for arbitrary [formula]. So, taking any n > (N + Ba2) / (1 - a2), we obtain a contradiction.

We see that to prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:I], it is enough to prove Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-inductive].

Let us prove Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-inductive] by induction on [formula]. The case n = 1 is already done.

We may assume that [formula]. For every [formula], we may assume that

[formula]

the singularities of the log pair

[formula]

are Kawamata log terminal along [formula] and not Kawamata log terminal at Ok.

The inequality a2 > (n - N) / (B + n - 1) holds.

The singularities of the log pair

[formula]

are not Kawamata log terminal at the point On - 1. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction] that

[formula]

which implies that a2 > (n - N) / (B + n - 1).

The inequalities [formula] hold.

The inequality [formula] follows from the fact that the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at the point On - 1.

Suppose that [formula]. Let us derive a contradiction.

It follows from Remark [\ref=remark:2-21] that [formula]. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. But a2 > (n - N) / (B + n - 1) by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-6]. Then

[formula]

where [formula] by assumption. Therefore, we see that

[formula]

where [formula]. But A + M > 1 and B + N > 1 by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-1], since a1 < 1 and a2 < 1. Then

[formula]

but [formula] by assumption. Then

[formula]

which implies that βA(B + N - 1) > α(B - 1)(A + M - 1). Then

[formula]

because [formula] by assumption. Then we have α  ≠  0 and A(B - 1) < 1, which is impossible, because [formula] by assumption.

The log pair () is Kawamata log terminal at every point of the set

[formula]

Suppose that there is a point Q∈Fn such that

[formula]

but () is not Kawamata log terminal at the point Q. Then the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at the point Q as well. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction], because [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-7]. Then

[formula]

because m0 < M + Aa1 - a2 and m0 < N + Ba2 - a1 by Remark [\ref=remark:2-21]. We have

[formula]

because [formula] and AB - 1 > 0. But m0 > 1. Thus, we see that

[formula]

which contradicts our initial assumptions.

The log pair () is Kawamata log terminal at the point [formula].

Suppose that () is not Kawamata log terminal at [formula]. Then the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at the point [formula] as well. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction], because [formula]. Note that

[formula]

which implies that m0 + a2 < Aa1 + M. Then

[formula]

which gives a1 > (n + 1 - nM) / (An + 1).

Now arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-7], we obtain a contradiction.

The assertion of Lemma [\ref=lemma:2-inductive] is proved. The assertion of Theorem [\ref=theorem:I] is proved.

One cyclic singular point

Let X be a sextic surface in [formula] with canonical singularities such that [formula], let [formula] be the natural double cover, let R be its ramification curve in [formula], and suppose that [formula] consists of one singular point of type [formula], where [formula].

The following equality holds:

[formula]

and if [formula], then there is a unique effective [formula]-divisor D on X such that [formula] and

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=theorem:KE], Corollary [\ref=corollary:Chen-Wang] and Remark [\ref=remark:lct-lct-n-2], we obtain the following two corollaries.

If [formula], then [formula] for every [formula].

If [formula], then X is Kähler-Enstein.

In the rest of this section we will prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-single-point].

Let D be an arbitrary effective [formula]-divisor on the surface X such that

[formula]

and put [formula]. To prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-single-point], it is enough to show that

[formula]

and if [formula], then D is uniquely defined. Note that [formula] if [formula] (see [\cite=Park-Won-PEMS]).

Let us prove Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-single-point]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:smooth-points], we may assume that [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:smooth-points]. Put [formula].

Let π:X̄  →  X be a minimal resolution, let [formula] be π-exceptional curves such that

[formula]

let C be the curve in | - KX| such that P∈C, and let [formula] be it proper transform on X̄. Then

[formula]

and the curve C is irreducible. We may assume that D  ≠  C, because [formula] if D = C.

By Remark [\ref=remark:convexity], we may assume that [formula].

Let [formula] be the proper transform of the divisor D on the surface X̄. Then

[formula]

where ai is a non-negative rational number. Then the log pair

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal (by Remark [\ref=remark:log-pull-back]). On the other hand, we have

[formula]

where all intersections [formula] are non-negative. Moreover, we have

[formula]

where the intersection   ·   is non-negative, since [formula] by assumption. Hence, we have

[formula]

It should be pointed out that at least one inequality in () must be strict, since   ·  Ei > 0 for at least one [formula], because [formula]. Then ai > 0 for some [formula].

Note that [formula] by (). Similarly, it follows from () that

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. Arguing in the same way, we see that

[formula]

for every [formula] (use () and induction on k). Using symmetry, we see that

[formula]

for every [formula]. In particular, the inequality ak > 0 holds for every [formula], since we already know that ai > 0 for some [formula].

Suppose that μai < 1 for every [formula]. Then

there exists a point

[formula]

such that the log pair () is not Kawamata log terminal at Q,

the log pair () is Kawamata log terminal outside of the point Q,

if μ < (m + 1) / (2m - 2), then [formula] and [formula].

It follows from Remark [\ref=remark:log-pull-back] and Theorem [\ref=theorem:connectedness] that there is a point [formula] such that the log pair () is not Kawamata log terminal at Q and is Kawamata log terminal elsewhere.

Suppose that Q∈E1 and [formula]. Then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction]. Taking () into account, we get

[formula]

and adding all these inequalities together we get

[formula]

which implies that a1 + am > 1. However, the later is impossible, since [formula] by ().

We see that if Q∈E1, then [formula]. Similarly, we see that [formula] if Q∈Em.

Suppose that Q∈Ei and [formula] for every j  ≠  i. Then i  ≠  1 and i  ≠  m. We have

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction]. Taking () into account, we get

[formula]

and adding all these inequalities together we get

[formula]

which implies that a1 + am > 1. However, the later is impossible, since [formula] by ().

Thus, we see that there is [formula] such that [formula].

Suppose that μ < (m + 1) / (2m - 2). Let us show that k  ≠  1 and k  ≠  m - 1.

Due to symmetry, it is enough to show that k  ≠  1. Recall that [formula].

Suppose that k = 1. Then [formula]. Take [formula] such that (m + 1) / (2m - 2) > μ̄  >  μ and

[formula]

is not Kawamata log terminal at Q and is Kawamata log terminal outside of the point Q. Then

[formula]

by (), since a1  ≠  0 and a2  ≠  0. On the other hand, we have

[formula]

since μ  <  μ̄. Therefore, it follows from Corollary [\ref=corollary:Dimitra] that

[formula]

which implies that a2(m - 2) > a3(m - 1), since μ  <  μ̄. But we proved earlier that

[formula]

which is impossible, since a2(m - 2) > a3(m - 1). Thus, we see that k  ≠  1.

If m = 3, then it follows from () that [formula], [formula], [formula].

If m = 3, then [formula].

Suppose that m = 4. Then [formula].

There is a unique smooth irreducible curve   ⊂  X̄ such that

[formula]

and [formula] (cf. the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:many-points-A4]). Put Z = π(). Then

[formula]

To complete the proof, it is enough to show that [formula]. Suppose that μ < 4 / 5.

By Remark [\ref=remark:convexity], we may assume that [formula], because Z is irreducible.

It follows from () that [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

Put [formula]. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:cyclic-orbifolds-blow-up] that () is not Kawamata log terminal at the point Q and is Kawamata log terminal outside of the point Q. Then

[formula]

which implies that [formula]. If [formula], then

[formula]

by Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction]. Thus, we see that either [formula] or [formula].

Without loss of generality, we may assume that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction], one has

[formula]

since [formula] and a3 > 5 / 6. The obtained contradiction concludes the proof.

Let τ be a biregular involution of the surface X̄ that is induced by the double cover ω.

Let 3 be the proper transform of the curve [formula] on the surface X̄. Then 3  ·  3 =  - 1 and

[formula]

which implies that E1  ·  3 = E2  ·  3 = E4  ·  3 = E5  ·  3  =    ·  3 = 0.

If τ(3) = 3, then 2π(3)  ~   - 2KX, but π(3) is not a Cartier divisor.

Put Z = π(3  +  τ(3)). Then Z  ~   - 2KX and [formula]. We see that [formula].

Suppose that D  ≠  Z / 2. To complete the proof, it is enough to show that μ > 2 / 3.

Let 2 be the proper transform of the curve [formula] on the surface X̄. Then 2  ·  2 =  - 1 and

[formula]

which implies that E1  ·  2 = E3  ·  2 = E4  ·  2 = E5  ·  2 = E6  ·  2  =    ·  2 = 0.

Let [formula] be a contraction of the curves 2, [formula], E6, E5 and E4. Then

Put 4  =  τ(3), 5  =  τ(2), [formula]. Then [formula] and

[formula]

which implies that [formula] for every i  ≠  5 and j  ≠  4.

Put L3  =  π(3), L4  =  π(4), L2  =  π(2), [formula], L5  =  π(5), [formula]. Then

[formula]

and [formula], which implies that [formula].

Note that [formula].

Suppose that D  ≠  (L3 + L4) / 2. To complete the proof, it is enough to show that μ > 2 / 3.

Suppose that [formula]. Let us derive a contradiction.

It follows from () that [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula].

By Remark [\ref=remark:convexity], without loss of generality we may assume that [formula]. Then

[formula]

which gives us [formula]. Similarly, we may assume that either [formula] or [formula], which implies that either [formula] or [formula], respectively.

Let us show that [formula]. We can easily see that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which implies that [formula], since [formula] and

[formula]

but [formula] is a Cartier divisor, which implies that [formula].

Since [formula], we may assume that [formula] does not contain at least one curve among L2, [formula] and L3 by Remark [\ref=remark:convexity], which implies that either [formula] or [formula].

It follows from () and [formula] that μai < 1 for every i. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:cyclic-orbifolds-blow-up], there exists a point

[formula]

such that () is not Kawamata log terminal at the point Q∈X̄, but it is Kawamata log terminal elsewhere. Take k∈{2,3,4} such that [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction] that

[formula]

Suppose that m = 7. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

the curve R is irreducible,

the surface X̄ contains an irreducible curve 4 such that 4  ·  4 =  - 1 and 4  ·  E4 = 1.

the surface X̄ contains an irreducible curve 4 such that 4  ·  4 =  - 1, 4  ·  E4 = 1 and

[formula]

Suppose that X̄ has an irreducible curve 4 such that 4  ·  4 =  - 1 and 4  ·  E4 = 1. Then

[formula]

where L4  =  π(4). Then τ(4) = 4 and [formula], because

[formula]

Suppose now that the curve R is reducible. Let us show that the surface X̄ contains an irreducible curve 4 such that 4  ·  4 =  - 1 and 4  ·  E4 = 1.

Let [formula] be a contraction of the curve [formula]. Then there is a commutative diagram

[formula]

where [formula] is a minimal resolution, φ is an anticanonical embedding, ψ is a projection from [formula], and [formula] is a double cover branched at [formula]. Note that [formula] is a del Pezzo surface and [formula].

The morphism [formula] contracts the smooth curves η(E2), η(E3), η(E4), η(E5) and η(E6). But

[formula]

and [formula] has a singularity of type [formula] at the point η(E2). Put [formula].

Put [formula]. Then [formula] is reducible, since R is reducible.

Since [formula], one of the following cases hold:

either φ(R) is a union of a smooth conic and an irreducible quartic,

or the curve φ(R) is a union of three different smooth conics.

The case when the curve φ(R) consists of a union of three different smooth conics is impossible, since the surface [formula] has a singularity of type [formula] at the point [formula].

We see that the curve φ(R) is a union of a smooth conic and an irreducible quartic curve, which easily implies that [formula] is a union of a line L and an irreducible cubic curve Z. Then

[formula]

because [formula] has a singularity of type [formula] at the point [formula]. Then X̄ contains a curve 4 such that

[formula]

and 4 is irreducible. Then 4  ·  4 =  - 1 and 4  ·  E4 = 1.

The proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:single-point-A7-reducible] can be simplified using the results obtained in [\cite=Park-Won].

Suppose that m = 7 and R is irreducible. Then [formula].

Arguing as in the proofs of Lemmas [\ref=lemma:single-point-A5] and [\ref=lemma:single-point-A6], we see that there is an irreducible smooth rational curve 2 on the surface X̄ such that 2  ·  2 =  - 1 and

[formula]

which implies that E1  ·  2 = E3  ·  2 = E4  ·  2 = E5  ·  2 = E6  ·  2 = E7  ·  2  =    ·  2 = 0.

Put 5  =  τ(2). Then 5  ·  5 =  - 1 and - KX̄  ·  5 = E5  ·  5 = 1, which implies that

[formula]

Since the branch curve R is reducible by Lemma [\ref=lemma:single-point-A7-reducible], one can show that there exists an irreducible smooth rational curve 3 on the surface X̄ such that 3  ·  3 =  - 1 and

[formula]

which implies that E1  ·  3 = E2  ·  3 = E4  ·  3 = E5  ·  3 = E6  ·  3 = E7  ·  3  =    ·  3 = 0.

Put 6  =  τ(2), 5  =  τ(3), L2  =  π(2), L3  =  π(4), L5  =  π(5) and L6  =  π(6). Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

which implies that L2 + 2L3  ~   - 3KX. Indeed, we have [formula], since

[formula]

and [formula]. But L2 + 2L3 is a Cartier divisor, which implies that L2 + 2L3  ~   - 3KX.

We have [formula] and L2  +  2L3  ~   - 3KX, which implies that [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:cyclic-orbifolds-blow-up], there exists k∈{2,3,4,5} such that () is not Kawamata log terminal at the point [formula] and is Kawamata log terminal outside of [formula].

Put [formula]. Then it follows from Lemma [\ref=lemma:adjunction] that

which is impossible by (), since we assume that either [formula] or [formula] and [formula].

Suppose that m = 7 and R is reducible. Then [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=lemma:single-point-A7-reducible], the surface X contains an irreducible curve 4 such that

[formula]

and -  4  ·  4  =  4  ·  E4 = 1. Then - KX̄  ·  4 = 1, which implies that

[formula]

Put L4  =  π(4). Then 2L4  ~   - 2KX and

which together with () immediately leads to a contradiction.

Suppose that m = 8. Then [formula].

Arguing as in the proofs of Lemmas [\ref=lemma:single-point-A5] and [\ref=lemma:single-point-A6], we see that there is an irreducible smooth rational curve 3 on the surface X̄ such that 3  ·  3 =  - 1 and

[formula]

which implies that E1  ·  3 = E2  ·  3 = E4  ·  3 = E5  ·  3 = E6  ·  3 = E7  ·  3  =    ·  3 = 0.

Put 6  =  τ(3). Then 6  ·  6 =  - 1 and - KX̄  ·  6 = E6  ·  6 = 1, which implies that

[formula]

Put L3  =  π(3) and L6  =  π(6). Then 3L3  ~  3L6  ~   - 3KX. On the other hand, we have

Let [formula] be the natural double cover given by | - 2KX|, and let τ be a biregular involution of the surface X̄ that is induced by ω. Put 2  =  τ(1). If m = 7, then

[formula]

and 2  ·  2 =  - 1, which implies that   ·  2 = 0 and [formula].

Put L1  =  π(1) and L2  =  π(2). Then L1 + L2  ~   - 2KX. If m = 7, then

To complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem:main-single-point-non-cyclic], we may assume that P is a point of type [formula], [formula] or [formula].

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the diagram

[formula]

if m = 6, then   ·  E4 = 1, which implies that and [formula],

if m = 7, then   ·  E1 = 1, which implies that and [formula],

if m = 8, then   ·  E8 = 1, which implies that and [formula].

Put k = 4 if m = 6, put k = 1 if m = 7, put k = 8 if m = 8. Then

Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:single-point-A7-reducible], we see that [formula].

Arguing as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma:single-point-A7-reducible-2] and using (), we see that [formula].

Suppose that m = 6. Then [formula], and if μ = 2 / 3, then
