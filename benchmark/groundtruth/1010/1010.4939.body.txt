Chemical Variation in Molecular Cloud Cores in the Orion A Cloud

Introduction

Most of stars in the Galaxy form in giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Molecular cloud cores are known to be the sites of star formation (e.g., [\cite=bei86]). The evolution of molecular cloud cores in GMCs is less understood, compared with that of nearby dark cloud cores. In nearby dark clouds, molecules such as CCS, HC3N, NH3, and N2H+, and the neutral carbon atom C0 are known to be good tracers of chemical evolution (e.g., [\cite=hir92] [\cite=suz92] [\cite=ben98] [\cite=mae99] [\cite=hir02] [\cite=hir09]). The carbon-chain molecules, CCS and HC3N tend to trace the early chemical evolutionary stage, whereas N-bearing molecules, NH3 and N2H+ tend to trace the late stage. We wonder how different the chemical properties of molecular cloud cores in GMCs are, compared with those in nearby dark clouds.

The Orion A cloud is an archetypal GMC. This cloud has been extensively mapped in 12CO J = 1-  0 [\citep=hey92], in 13CO J = 1-  0 [\citep=bal87] [\citep=nag98], in CS J = 1-  0 [\citep=tat93], in CS J = 2-  1 [\citep=tat98], in NH3 [\citep=bat83] [\citep=ces94], in H13CO+ J = 1-  0 [\citep=ike07] and in N2H+ J = 1-  0 [\citep=tat08]. The dust continuum emission in the Orion A cloud was studied by [\citet=chi97], [\citet=lis98], and [\citet=joh99].

The chemical variation has been suggested in limited regions in the Orion A GMC. [\citet=ung97] studied the region near Orion KL in many molecular lines, and have shown difference in molecular abundance between the Orion KL region, the Orion Bar, and the molecular ridge. [\citet=tat93] studied the region covering Orion KL and OMC-2 (see their Figure 4), and found that NH3 tends to be stronger in the north (OMC-2 region) while CS tends to be stronger in the south. [\citet=tat08] showed that N2H+ is widely distributed over the [formula]-shaped filament of the Orion A GMC, and pointed out that NH3 and N2H+ is relatively strong toward OMC-2, compared with the H13CO+ and CS distribution. [\citet=joh03] astrochemically compared submillimeter dust continuum sources in the Orion A GMC.

In this study, we investigate the global chemical characteristics of molecular cloud cores in the Orion A GMC through new molecular-line observations. The purposes of this study are (1) to search for the CCS emission, which may represent the young molecular cloud material, (2) to study the chemical properties of the cloud cores through the line intensity variation and the column density ratio variation ALONG the Orion A GMC filament, and (3) to compare the chemical properties of Orion cores with those of dark cloud cores.

The distance to the Orion A cloud is estimated to be 418 pc [\citep=kim08]. At this distance, 1[formula] corresponds to 0.12 pc.

Observations

Observations were carried out by using the 45 m radio telescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory from 2009 April 3 to 6. The employed receiver front ends were the single-element SIS receivers, "T100V" and "S40". We observed HN13C J = 1-  0 at 87.090859 GHz and DNC J = 1-  0 at 76.305717 GHz by using the 2SB receiver "T100V", and CCS JN = 43 - 32 at 45.379033 GHz [\citep=yam90] and HC3N J = 5-  4 at 45.490316 GHz (the frequencies of the hyperfine-components are averaged with weighting) [\citep=lov04] by using the SSB receiver "S40". All the lines were observed simultaneously, by using two receivers with a polarization splitter. The half-power beamwidth of the telescope with the T100V and S40 receivers were 18[formula]4±  0[formula]1 and 38[formula]5±  0[formula]1 at 86 and 43 GHz, respectively. The receiver back end was acousto-optical spectrometers. The spectral resolution was 37 kHz (corresponding to ~   0.25 km s- 1 at 45 GHz, ~   0.15 km s- 1 at 76 GHz, and 0.13 km s- 1 at 87 GHz). Spectra were obtained in the position-switching mode. The employed off position was either (Δ R. A., Δ Dec.) = (-  30[formula], 5[formula]), (0[formula], -  100[formula]), or (107[formula], -  95[formula]) with respect to Orion KL. The intensity is reported in terms of the corrected antenna temperature T*A. The main-beam efficiency was 0.42±  0.02 for "T100V", and 0.73±  0.04 for "S40". The telescope pointing was established by observing Orion KL in the 43-GHz SiO maser line every 60-  80 min.

The positions for the observations were chosen from intensity peak positions of 125 CS cores in [\citet=tat93]. The core name used here is 'TUKH' followed by three digits of the core number of [\citet=tat93]. Note that the degrees of the declination were printed incorrectly for cores TUKH068 and TUKH070 in Table 1 of [\citet=tat93]: "-  5[formula]" should read "-  6[formula]." We selected 81 peak positions toward which both CS J = 1-  0 and CS J = 2-  1 were clearly and consistently detected without velocity-component confusion, on the basis of [\citet=tat98]. In the CCS and HC3N observations, we lost some data due to a mistake in the receiver set-up, and we do not use data with high noise levels . The final number of the cores successfully observed in CCS and HC3N is 62 (out of 81). The observed data were reduced by using the software package "NewStar" of Nobeyama Radio Observatory.

Results and Discussion

Line Intensities and Their Variations

Table 1 summarizes the observed line parameters: the peak intensity T*A, the LSR velocity ΔvLSR, and the linewidth of CCS, HC3N. HN13C, and DNC. The HC3N peak intensity in the table represents T*A of the observed spectrum rather than the hyperfine-component intensity. 'Three dots' in T*A means either 'not observed' or 'omitted because noise level is too high (the rms noise level is larger than 0.14 K).' Figures [\ref=fig:figure1] and [\ref=fig:figure2] show the CCS spectra obtained toward cores TUKH083 and TUKH122, respectively. To our knowledge, the detection of CCS has not been reported in Orion GMC cores previously, and our observations serve as the first CCS detection in this cloud. Because it is suggested that CCS traces young molecular gas (<   106 yr; e.g. [\cite=suz92]) in nearby dark clouds, it is very interesting that the Orion A GMC, whose age is at least of order 107 yr (e.g. Bally et al. 1987), harbors an early-type molecule CCS. Furthermore, the detection rate is high. We detected CCS in 20 core peaks out of 62, implying the detection rate is 32%. For HC3N, the detection rate is 53% (33 out of 62). The detection rates for DNC and HN13C are 32% (26 out of 81) and 37% (30 out of 81), respectively. [\citet=tat08] did not detected CCS anywhere in the OMC-2/3 region, but better rms noise levels in the present study allowed us to detect one core TUKH003 in CCS out of six observed cores in the OMC-2/3 region, resulting in a detection rate of 17% in this region. We compare our detection rates with previous studies. [\citet=hir09] observed CCS and HC3N toward nearby dark cloud cores and their detection rates were 42% and 42%, and [\citet=sak08] observed the same molecules toward infrared dark clouds and their detection rates were 0% and 78%, respectively. These studies including the present study used the same telescope. The rms noise level was ~  0.1 K (CCS) and ~  0.15 K (HC3N) in the present study, ~  0.05 K (CCS) and ~  0.1 K (HC3N) in [\cite=hir09], and ~  0.2 K in [\citet=sak08]. The non-detection of CCS in infrared dark clouds is in contrast with the detection rate of CCS in Orion A GMC cores and in nearby dark cloud cores. This can be partly due to somewhat higher rms noise level for observations toward infrared dark clouds. Infrared dark clouds are farther than Orion A GMC and nearby dark clouds, and smaller beam filling factor of CCS may explain difference. However, the HC3N detection rate is higher in infrared dark clouds, and it is impossible to explain difference between CCS and HC3N detection rates only in terms of sensitivity and beam dilution. It is most likely that different detection rates reflect difference in chemical properties between infrared dark clouds and the others. The detection rates of CCS and HC3N in Orion are not very different from those in nearby dark clouds. It seems that Orion GMC cores are more similar to nearby dark cloud cores than infrared dark clouds.

The observed lines are thought to be optically thin. We investigate the peak intensity variation along the Orion A GMC filament. Figure [\ref=fig:figure3] plots the CCS peak intensity T*A against the declination. Note that the Orion A GMC is roughly elongated in the NS direction (e.g., [\cite=bal87]). CCS-detected cores are not localized, but are distributed over the Orion A GMC. It seems that the CCS peak intensity is stronger in the south (Dec. <   -  6.5 deg). We wonder whether there is any relationship between the CS and CCS intensities, because these molecules are thought to be chemically related [\citep=suz92]. Figure [\ref=fig:figure4] compares the CCS peak intensity with the CS peak intensity of [\citet=tat93]. There is no positive correlation between these intensities. Most intense CCS cores are weak in CS. From the CS intensity, it is hard to predict the CCS detection. Figure [\ref=fig:figure5] compares the CCS peak intensity with the NH3 rotation temperature [\citep=wil99]. CCS was not detected toward Orion KL, which is warm (Trot >   50 K and kinetic temperature Tkin = 70-  150 K; [\cite=gen89]; [\cite=wil99]). See [\citet=dan88] for the Trot - Tkin relation.

Next, we show an observational result in HC3N. Figure [\ref=fig:figure6] plots the HC3N peak intensity against the declination. Again, HC3N-detected cores are not localized, but distributed over the Orion A GMC filament. There are two characteristics in the HC3N peak intensity distribution. First, the HC3N peak intensity tends to be stronger toward the south, as the CCS peak intensity distribution does. Because CCS and HC3N are known to be early-type molecules in nearby dark clouds, this similarity can be understood as they trace similar chemical evolutionary stages. Second, the HC3N intensity is very strong around Orion KL (Dec. = -  5.375 deg), which is not seen in the CCS intensity distribution. The HC3N linewidth toward Orion KL is broad (~   6 km s- 1), and it seems that the HC3N emission is also affected by star formation activities such as molecular outflows.

We investigate the variation also in the velocity-integrated intensity [formula]. Figures [\ref=fig:figure7] and [\ref=fig:figure8] show the integrated intensities of CCS and HC3N against the declination. The integrated intensity is calculated for the best-fit Gaussian to the observed spectrum. The CCS and HC3N linewidths are larger near the Orion Nebula region, and become smaller toward the south (not shown) as observed in other moleculs [\citep=tat93]. The integrated intensity does not tend to be high toward the south in CCS, and tends to be high only weakly toward the south in HC3N. It seems that the variation in the peak and integrated intensities are similar in CCS and HC3N except for the strong HC3N emission near Orion KL.

Column Densities

We investigate the chemical properties of the cloud cores by using the column density ratio of the molecules. The column density is calculated by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with two excitation temperatures: Tex = Trot and Tex = Trot/2. Trot is taken from NH3 observations of [\citet=wil99]. The NH3 rotation temperature is very close to the gas kinetic temperature Tk for Tk [formula] 30 K [\citep=dan88]. We use Tex = Trot as (almost) thermalized cases and Tex = Trot/2 as subthermal cases. When [\citet=wil99] lists an upper or lower limit to the rotation temperature, we employ the limit value as Trot. When [\citet=wil99] does not list a rotation temperature due to no detection, we assume Trot = 20 K, i.e., Tex = 20 and 10 K. The dipole moments of CCS, HC3N, DNC, and HN13C are 2.81 [\citep=mur90], and 3.724, 3.050, and 2.699 Debye (JPL Catalog), respectively. The upper limit to the column density is defined as 3σ for 1 km s- 1 velocity width.

To see the chemical properties, we compare the column density of the late-type molecule NH3 to the early-type molecule CCS. Figures [\ref=fig:figure9] and [\ref=fig:figure10] plot the N(NH3)/N(CCS) column density ratio against the declination, with CCS excitation temperatures of Trot and Trot/2, respectively. The ratio is not constant, is lowest in the middle, and becomes higher toward the north (Dec. [formula] -  5.5 deg) and south (Dec. <   -  7 deg). This suggests that the Orion A GMC filament has global chemical variation along the filament. We found that the CCS and HC3N peak intensities are stronger in the south region. However, this tendency is not seen (CCS) or not very prominent (HC3N) in the integrated intensity. Furthermore, the NH3 column density is also higher in the south. As a result, southern cores are found to have large N(NH3)/N(CCS). The logarithmic column density ratio of NH3 to CCS, log N(NH3)/N(CCS) ranges from 0.9 to 2.3. If CCS and NH3 represent early and late evolutionary stages, respectively, also in GMCs, the Orion A GMC is chemically younger in the middle and older in the north and south regions.

We plot starless cores and star-forming cores separately in Figures [\ref=fig:figure9] and [\ref=fig:figure10] (and hereafter). Here, the cores associated with molecular outflows and/or IRAS point sources are classifies as star-forming cores (Table 1 of [\cite=tat93]). Furthermore, we visually investigated the Spitzer 24 μm MIPS images. We found that observed cores TUKH008, TUKH056, TUKH079, TUKH087, TUKH092, TUKH097, TUKH111, and TUKH125 are associated with point sources. Cores TUKH092 and TUKH097 are associated with several and two point sources, respectively, while the other cores are associated with one point source each. These are also classified as star-forming cores. On the other hand, core TUKH89 associated with Morgan 18 does not accompany a Spitzer source. [\citet=mor91] identified a molecular outflow but its distribution is not well defined. We exclude this core as a star-forming core and classified as a starless core. Note that identification of the Spitzer MIPS images is difficult near the Orion Nebula due to intense diffuse infrared emission. We investigate the relationship between N(NH3)/N(CCS) and the association with young stellar objects. High N(NH3)/N(CCS) cores (N(NH3)/N(CCS) [formula] 30) are mostly starless cores, which is in contrast with results in dark cloud cores ([\cite=suz92]; [\cite=hir09]). The reason for this is not clear. The high N(NH3)/N(CCS) cores are located in outer regions w.r.t. the central part of the Orion Nebula, and therefore the poor MIPS identification near the Orion Nebula cannot be the cause of this.

Figures [\ref=fig:figure11] and [\ref=fig:figure12] show N(NH3)/N(CCS) against the core average density n, with different CCS excitation temperature assumptions. N(NH3)/N(CCS) and the average density n show no correlation or a positive, weak correlation. A weak positive correlation, if true, may mean that evolved cores tends to have high-density gas due to physical evolution and high N(NH3)/N(CCS) due to chemical evolution, or that cores having high-density gas intrinsically tends to have higher N(NH3)/N(CCS) due to faster chemical evolution, if we assume N(NH3)/N(CCS) represents the chemical evolution as in dark cloud cores.

[\citet=hir09] compared the N(NH3)/N(CCS) column density ratio among various star forming regions. Figures [\ref=fig:figure13] and [\ref=fig:figure14] show N(CCS) against N(NH3)/N(CCS) in the Orion A GMC to compare with diagrams in [\citet=hir09]. N(NH3)/N(CCS) ranges from ~  3 to ~  100 in Orion A GMC, from ~  10 to ~  1000 in Perseus, and from ~  20 to ~  1000 in Ophiuchus. On the other hand, it ranges from 2 to 400 in Taurus. Taurus have cores with very low N(NH3)/N(CCS) (~   2-  7), which corresponds to "Carbon-Chain-Producing Regions (CCPRs)" [\citep=hir09]. Cores in Perseus and Ophiuchus do not show very low N(NH3)/N(CCS). Figure [\ref=fig:figure14] does not show very low N(NH3)/N(CCS) in Orion, but Figure [\ref=fig:figure13] shows very low N(NH3)/N(CCS). Note that one star-forming core in Orion shows very low N(NH3)/N(CCS) in Figure [\ref=fig:figure13]. Orion GMC cores seem not to have high N(NH3)/N(CCS) ratios compared with Perseus and Ophiuchus. It is known that an N-bearing molecule emitting region is more compact than a CCS emitting region in L1544 in Taurus ([\cite=aik01] and references therein). A possibility is that NH3, which may have emitting reqions smaller than CCS also in Orion, will be beam diluted in Orion, which is three times more distant than other regions. The telescope beam size is ~   40arcsec  in both of the NH3 and CCS observations. We need to check this possibility with higher angular resolution observations. Regarding the N(NH3)/N(CCS)-  N(CCS) diagram, we should use N(CCS)/N(H2) instead of N(CCS) as the ordinate to compare with the theoretical calculations of [\citet=suz92], as explained in [\citet=hir09]. Orion GMC cores have higher column densities than Taurus cores. The average column density of cores derived from N2H+ is 6.7×  1022 cm- 2 [\citep=tat08] and 1.7×  1022 cm- 2 [\citep=tat04] in the Orion A GMC cores and Taurus cores, respectively. Here, for Taurus, we used the column density derived from the spatially-smoothed spectrum, which compensates for the difference in linear resolution due to a factor of 3 difference in distance. The difference in the average column density is a factor of 4, and we should take into account this "vertical shift" to compare the N(NH3)/N(CCS)-N(CCS) diagram. Next, we investigate the origin of CCS. [\citet=ike99] observed the coexistence of the neutral carbon atom and CO over the Orion A GMC, and suggested that the origin of the neutral carbon atom might be the photodissociation region due to the cloud clumpiness under UV irradiation. We wonder whether CCS in the Orion GMC is related with photodissociation. CCS was not detected toward cores TUKH034 and TUKH036 located along the Orion Bar, which is an archetypal photodissociation region (PDR). Then, it is not likely that photodissociation in a clumpy cloud explains CCS in the Orion A GMC. It is suggested that CCS exists also in evolved molecular gas as secondary late-stage peak due to CO depletion ([\cite=zli02] and references therein). On the other hand, CO depletion will be less effective in warm molecular gas in Orion. The gas kinetic temperature of Orion cores ranges from ~   10 K to >   50 K [\citep=wil99]. Figures [\ref=fig:figure15] shows N(NH3)/N(CCS) against Trot. Warmer Trot cores tend to have low N(NH3)/N(CCS). The variation of the NH3 rotation temperatrure Trot toward cores is shown in [\citet=wil99] (TUKH core number is in declination order). Very low N(NH3)/N(CCS) cores in Orion A GMC are warm, and it seems that they have physical properties very different from CCPRs in nearby dark cloud cores. It is not clear whether chemical models can explain CCS abundance at warm (Trot = 20-  35 K, Tkin = 20-  55 K) Orion cores qualitatively. We wonder why star-forming cores do not tend to have higher N(NH3)/N(CCS) clearly, as expected from chemical evolution in dark cloud cores. In Taurus the displacement of CCS and NH3 is clear because there are CCPRs. On the other hand, in Perseus, Ophiuchus, and Orion, the displacement is not very clear. This may be partly because the range of N(NH3)/N(CCS) is narrower than that in Taurus, partly because CCS may exist also in evolved cores and possibly because the observational errors are too large to see the separation even if it exists. Furthermore, we should point out that identification of young stellar objects in Orion are incomplete because of the diffuse infrared emission of the Orion Nebula on the Spitzer MIPS image and because of the limited spatial resolution of the CS observations of ~   40arcsec  [\citep=tat93].

We found two very interesting Orion cores. TUKH122, whose CCS spectrum is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:figure2], is the most intense core in CCS, which is strong also in NH3. This core has a substantial amount of both CCS and N-bearing molecule. TUKH083, whose CCS spectrum is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:figure1], is the core with the lowest N(NH3)/N(CCS) column density ratio. This core has a substantial amount of th early-type molecule CCS. These two cores look starless through the visual inspection of Spitzer 24 micron images. The core mass is 50-60 solar masses from the CS observations by [\citet=tat93], and these cores will be very good candidates for future cluster formation.

Deuterium Fractionation

We show the column density ratio of DNC to HN13C to see the deuterium fractionation. Figures [\ref=fig:figure16] plots N(DNC)/N(HN13C) column density ratio against the declination. Because the LTE column density ratio from molecular lines at similar frequencies depends on Tex only very weakly, we show the result only for Tex = Trot. Around Orion KL, the ratio has the minimum values. Figures [\ref=fig:figure17] plots N(DNC)/N(HN13C) against the NH3 rotation temperature [\citep=wil99]. The ratio is lower for warmer cores. This indicates that the deuterium enhancement is less efficient in warm cores. Similar results have been shown previously by, e.g., [\citet=sne79], [\citet=woo87], and [\citet=sch92]. We conclude that the tendency seen in N(DNC)/N(HN13C) is due to variation in the gas temperature: D/H decreases with increasing gas kinetic temperature. There are two possibilities for this: dependence of exchange reactions between HD and molecular ion on temperature [\citep=sne79] or dependence of CO depletion on temperature. At low temperatures, the depletion of molecules becomes efficient, the H2D+/H+3 abundance ratio increases, and then molecular D/H ratios increase [\citep=rob00]. It is found that the deuterium fractionation is a tracer of the chemical age of dark cloud cores [\citep=hir06]. However, the variation observed in the present study is due to variation of gas temperature rather than core evolution, because Orion cores do not have CCPRs. Figures [\ref=fig:figure18] plots N(DNC)/N(HN13C) against the core average density. It seems that high-density cores tend to show low N(DNC)/N(HN13C). Depletion will be more serious in high-density cores at cold temperatures, and therefore the above result cannot be explained in terms of different depletion degrees due to different density. We conclude that different N(DNC)/N(HN13C) is due to difference in gas temperature, not due to difference in density.

Summary

We have detected CCS in the Orion A GMC for the first time. CCS-detected cores are not localized in the Orion cloud and widely distributed. The CCS peak intensity tends to be high in southern cores. The HC3N peak intensity of cores tends to be high toward the south, while there are also HC3N intense cores near Orion KL. The core associated with Orion KL show intense wing emission, and star formation activity near Orion KL seems to enhance the HC3N intensity. The NH3/CCS column density ratio is higher in the north and south regions and lower in the middle region, suggesting the chemical variation along the Orion A GMC filament. This ratio is a good tracer of chemical evolution in nearby dark cloud cores, but seems to be affected by core gas temperature in the Orion A GMC. This ratio tends to be low for warmer cores. The DNC to HN13C column density ratio is generally similar to that observed in dark cloud cores, but becomes lower around Orion KL. Variation in the DNC to HN13C column density ratio seems to reflect the temperature variation among cores.
