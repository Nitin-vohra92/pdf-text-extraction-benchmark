Lengths matters, periodically. (The movie) Fluid Dynamics Video

The video shows the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability between two immiscible fluids for four distinct initial single-mode perturbations. To obtain such controlled initial conditions, a Magnetic Levitation technique is used (see [\cite=Ref1]). The principle is explained in the first part of the animation. A homogeneous magnetic force is produced in opposition to gravity and allows the stabilization of the dense fluid (paramagnetic aqueous mixture) above the less dense fluid (hexadecane). In addition, segments of magnetically permeable wires are placed on the outside of the cell in a precise configuration - predicted numerically - to achieve almost any desired initial condition (see [\cite=Ref2]). The initial interface thus is no longer flat and the experiment is started by turning off the magnetic field and allowing the denser fluid to fall under gravity. Here the wires are periodically aligned along a row, a few mm above the initial interface position, producing a small amplitude single mode perturbation of the same wavelength as the wires (but too small to image). The video presents the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability for four decreasing wavelengths (15 mm, 12.5, 10 mm and 7.5 mm). In each case, one observes the different stages of development of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability from the early time linear behavior to the late mixing flow. The second instability also can be observed. The link for the video is: .
