Abstract

We show that the N = 2 superstrings may be viewed as a special class of the N = 4 superstrings and demonstrate their equivalence. This allows us to realize all known string theories based on linear algebras and with N < 4 supersymmetries as special choices of the vacua in the N = 4 superstring.

One of the fascinating features of string theories is their high degree of uniqueness. The choice of their vacua seems to be the only freedom we have. It is therefore tempting to contemplate that there may be a universal theory from which all string theories are derived just by selecting different vacua. The present formulation of string theories, however, is too rigid to make the freedom of choosing a vacuum manifest.

A recent discovery by Berkovits and Vafa [\cite=BV] has opened a way to interpret all string theories as kinds of spontaneously broken phases of string theories with higher world-sheet symmetries. In particular, they have shown that the N = 0 ~ (N = 1) strings can be viewed as a special class of vacua for the N = 1 ~ (N = 2) superstrings. The equivalence of these [formula] and N = 0 ~ (N = 1) strings has been discussed in the original paper [\cite=BV], where it has been shown that the scattering amplitudes coincide, and this is further confirmed in refs. [\cite=FO] [\cite=IK] [\cite=FB] [\cite=OP]. Given these results, it is natural to speculate that N = 2 string theories can also be embedded into N = 4 string theories [\cite=N4S]. The main obstacle in this subject at the moment seems to be that nobody knows how to compute the scattering (loop) amplitudes for general N = 4 string theories. However, we can use the method in refs. [\cite=IK] [\cite=OP] which makes use of a similarity transformation to relate the two theories. This will enable us to show the equivalence for scattering amplitudes without going into the details of how to compute them, and will give an isomorphism between the operator algebras.

The purpose of this paper is to realize the N = 2 superstring as a special choice of the vacua in the N = 4 superstring, and to give a simple and explicit proof that our N = 4 formulation is equivalent to the N = 2 superstring. This completes the program of embedding string theories with N < 4 supersymmetries into a universal string theory, which turns out to be the so-called 'large' N = 4 superstring with O(4) symmetry [\cite=N4S] [\cite=STV].

In order to embed the N = 2 superstrings with matter central charge cm = 6 into N = 4, it might be natural to first try the 'small' N = 4 string with SU(2) symmetry [\cite=N4S]. Since the ghosts for this theory consist of one fermionic (b,c), four bosonic (β,γ) and three fermionic (b1,c1) systems with spins [formula] and (1,0), respectively, it would be necessary to introduce two fermionic (η,ξ) and two bosonic (β,γ) systems with spins [formula] and (1,0) as additional matter fields in order to cancel the extra ghosts compared with the N = 2 superstring. These additional matter fields carry the right central charge - 18, so that one will get a system with c =  - 12, appropriate for the matter system of the 'small' N = 4 superstring. From previous experiences in the case of lower supersymmetry [\cite=BV], one would then expect that one of the additional supersymmetry generators may be obtained just by improving the N = 2 BRST current by total derivative terms such that it becomes nilpotent. It turns out that one can indeed uniquely improve the BRST current this way. However, the whole algebra that is satisfied by all the generators is not the small one but the so-called large N = 4 superconformal algebra with zero central charge [\cite=GR].

We will use N = 2 superfields to describe the N = 4 superstring theory as in ref. [\cite=GR]. Let us take the N = 2 superstrings with matter super stress-energy tensor Tm with central charge cm  =  6, and add to the system two fermionic superfields (η,ξ), similar to the ghosts in the N = 2 string but with the spin shifted to the value [formula]. These additional fields contribute - 6 to the central charge, resulting in a total central charge c = 0.

The large N = 4 superconformal algebra consists of four N = 2 superfield generators [formula] and J, and their operator products (OPE) are given by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the super coordinates, [formula] and [formula] are the supercovariant derivatives in N = 2 superspace, [formula], and O stands for the generators [formula] and J with dimensions given by hO  =  1 / 2 for [formula] and hO = 0 for J. In general the large N = 4 superconformal algebra [\cite=STV] has more structure with two parameters k+ and k- characterizing the levels of the two SU(2) current algebras and with central charge c = 6k+k- / (k+ + k-). In eq. (1), we have given the algebra for the special case of k+ = k- and in the limit k+  →  0 which is the one realized in the N = 2 theory.

The matter generators for the N = 4 algebra turn out to be given by [\cite=GR]

[formula]

Using the OPE for Tm which is the same as that given in eq. (1) with c = 6 and the correlation

[formula]

it is easy to check that these indeed satisfy the OPE (1) with central charge c = 0.

The BRST operator for this N = 4 superstring takes the form

[formula]

where the four sets of fields [formula] and (Cj,Bj) with spins [formula] [formula] and (0,0) are the reparametrization, supersymmetry and current ghosts in N = 2 superfields for the large N = 4 superstrings with the correlations

[formula]

In eq. (4), the generators with subscript gh are those for ghosts:

[formula]

It is easy to check that these generators also satisfy the OPE in eq. (1) with c = 0.

Substituting (2) and (6) into (4), we find after partial integration

[formula]

It is straightforward but tedious to check the nilpotency of this BRST operator directly since the OPE of the BRST current with itself produces quite a large number of terms which add up to total derivatives. The equivalent result can be proved if the double commutators of the BRST charge with all the fundamental fields vanish since this means that the square of the charge vanishes in the Hilbert space of the theory. By this method as well as the direct method, we have checked that this BRST charge has the desired properties, and in particular that it is indeed nilpotent.

We would like to compare this BRST operator with that of the N = 2 superstring:

[formula]

Our first step to show the equivalence is to transform the BRST operator (7) into a direct sum of that for the N = 2 superstrings (8) with some additional terms and those for topological sectors by a similarity transformation

[formula]

where

[formula]

and where

[formula]

are the BRST operators for the topological sectors. It is easy to confirm that the operators on the right hand side of (9) all anticommute with one another and are nilpotent. From eq. (9), we see that the cohomology of the QN = 4 is a direct product of those of [formula] and QU(1).

The BRST operator Qtop imposes the condition that [formula] and ξ fall into the quartet representations of the BRST operator and all decouple from the physical subspace. Consequently the cohomology of the Qtop consists only of their vacuum.

The condition imposed by QU(1) tells us that the modes Bg,Cg,Bj and Cj also make quartets and decouple from the physical subspace except for the combinations CgBg and its arbitrary powers all of which have vanishing ghost number. However, those combinations with zero ghost number have zero norm because the OPE of the current CgBg with itself is non-singular. It follows that these modes also completely decouple from the physical subspace. This means that we can disregard the additional terms in [formula] which then reduces to the ordinary N = 2 BRST operator QN = 2.

Thus the cohomology of our theory is basically reduced to that of the N = 2 superstring and we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the cohomologies of QN = 4 and QN = 2. It is also clear that the transformation manifestly preserves the operator algebra. This establishes the equivalence of the N = 2 superstrings and the special classes of N = 4 superstrings described above.

We have thus succeeded in embedding the N = 2 superstring into the N = 4 superstring in such a way that it is completely equivalent to the N = 2 string. Combined with the existing embeddings of strings into those with higher symmetries, we now have a universal string theory realized as the N = 4 superstring, from which all the known string theories with N < 4 supersymmetries may be obtained by particular choices of vacua.

It remains to be seen if we can also get the small N = 4 superstring with SU(2) symmetry from this theory. This investigation also suggests that if one can find an improvement of the BRST current by total derivatives such that its square is zero, one can further extend the theory to higher string theory. Another line of investigation is to try to embed strings into W-strings. An embedding of the bosonic string into the W3 string has been found in ref. [\cite=BFW]. It would be interesting to examine these issues in the light of our approach.
