The Mass of the Dilaton Haim Goldberg Department of Physics Northeastern University Boston, MA 02115

Introduction

The dilaton is a spin-0 field which is associated with the graviton and with an axion as a massless excitation in string theory [\cite=witten]. In the field theoretic limit it persists as a massless spin-0 field in the no-scale supergravity theory. A truly massles dilaton is of course incompatible with the success of Newtonian gravity, since it couples as a full strength Brans-Dicke field. However, even if a dynamical mechanism were to be found to stabilize the dilaton potential [\cite=dilpot], perhaps generating a dilaton mass of the order of the the SUSY-breaking mSUSY  ~  1 , severe cosmological problems would still persist. Most notably, the late decay time would cause a substantial reheating well after the nucleosynthesis era [\cite=dilatondecay], vitiating a major success of the standard cosmological model. All of this could conceivably be modified if the dilaton were coupled to a field whose interactions are strong: assuming that the dilaton masslessness is not protected by a strict gauge principle, then mass growth could occur as a result of mixing with composite spin-0 objects in the strongly-interacting sector. This is the mechanism I will consider in this work.

Effective Potential

I begin by presenting the minimal components of the model necessary for this work. I assume that the dilaton field S is universally coupled to all (hidden and unhidden) gauge fields Fiμν, giving a contribution to the Lagrangian

[formula]

The dilaton field is assumed to develop a vev [formula] leaving an interaction with the remaining (quantum) field

[formula]

where [formula] and the gauge fields in Eq. ([\ref=eq:sigf]) are now normalized with canonical kinetic energy. I now assume that at some scale Λ the gauge coupling becomes strong. What I have mostly in mind, of course, is the hidden-gaugino condensate mechanism for generating SUSY-breaking [\cite=nillesetal]. In such models, one commonly obtains

[formula]

so that [formula]Λ[formula] In any case, the spectrum at scales below Λ will now contain glueballs, at least one of which will have spin-0, and which will be denoted by G. As a result of ([\ref=eq:sigf]), there will be σG mixing, which can be parametrized by a mixing term

[formula]

The coupling ([\ref=eq:sigf]) and dimensional considerations imply

[formula]

with κ  ~  O(1). To complete the effective potential for the σG system, I introduce glueball and dilaton mass terms, and some quartic terms to stabilize the potential:

[formula]

In Eq. ([\ref=eq:vsigg]), m2σ,λσ and λG are unknown. For the glueball mass, along with the estimates ([\ref=eq:msig]) and ([\ref=eq:mu]), we expect

[formula]

with α  ~  O(1). Although the parameters m2σ,λσ,λG have been introduced in complete ignorance of their origin and magnitude, it will turn out, very remarkably, that (a) only λσ will be required to be non-zero and (b) as long as λσ > O((Λ / mPl)4), the mass eigenvalues will be determined entirely by mG and μ, and will not depend on λσ to leading order in Λ / mPl.

Mass Spectrum: Simplified Case

I first note that, in the absence of the mixing term, the potential has a minimum at σ = G = 0. The mixing term shifts this minimum, as well as the mass eigenvalues. We can obtain a general idea of the result of this by considering a simplified situation, in which λG = m2σ = 0. The potential then becomes

[formula]

The stationary conditions are

[formula]

These are consistent with either σ = G = 0, or with

[formula]

It is simple to check that the zero-field point (0,0) is a saddle point of V(0), whereas (,) lies below that for the zero field values. Thus (,) is a true minimum, with energy

[formula]

It is important to note that as long as λσ  ≫  (Λ / mPl)4, the shift in S due to the new vacuum is δS =  / mPl  ≪  1 / g2.

One may wish to constrain the parameters so that the shift in vacuum value of energy be [formula] where the F is a SUSY-breaking F-term, of O(mPlmSUSY). From ([\ref=eq:msig]), this is equivalent to requiring

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=eq:evac]), combined with ([\ref=eq:mu]), ([\ref=eq:mg]), and ([\ref=eq:vbar]), implies [\cite=lsig]

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:barsigg]) and ([\ref=eq:vzero]) one may calculate the quadratic fluctuation matrix ( i.e, the σG (mass)2 matrix M2) about (,):

[formula]

There is a remarkable aspect about this result: although a non-zero value of λσ was required in order to establish the non-trivial vacuum, the fluctuations about this vacuum do not depend on the value of λσ. This parameter has acted as a regulator, disappearing in the physical masses (although not in the vacuum energy). The eigenvalues may be immediately calculated, and are most transparent in leading order in (|μ| / m2G)  ~  Λ / mPl:

[formula]

Mass Spectrum: General Case

The treatment of the more general case is slightly more complicated, but the result is the same. In what follows, it will be convenient to set mPl = 1 until the end, and to define

[formula]

In accordance with Eqs. ([\ref=eq:mu]) and ([\ref=eq:mg]),

[formula]

Typically, models of dilaton potentials prior to mixing with glueball give

[formula]

Beginning with the potential ([\ref=eq:vsigg]), it is apparent that a tachyonic instability develops in the quadratic sector if

[formula]

which will certainly be the case with the estimates in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:mepso]) and ([\ref=eq:mepst]). In such a case, we search for the displaced vacuum and spectrum for ([\ref=eq:vsigg]). The extremum conditions following from ([\ref=eq:vsigg]) are

[formula]

These allow the solution σ = G = 0, with V = 0; this is a saddle point if ([\ref=eq:tach]) is true. Alternately, there is a non-trivial solution which follows from ([\ref=eq:statt]). On eliminating G via

[formula]

in terms of a dimensionless variable x, one obtains from Eq. ([\ref=eq:statt]) the quartic equation

[formula]

The analysis of the solution spectrum of ([\ref=eq:x]) goes as follows:  We first note that, in terms of the small quantity ε (Eq. ([\ref=eq:eps])),

[formula]

It is then easy to show that (i) f(0) < 0, f(x  ≥  1) > 0; (ii) if λσ > O(ε10), then f(x) is a monotonically increasing function for x  ≥  0. In that case, there is one and only one root for positive x, and we can obtain it by expanding around x = 1. After some algebra, one finds that the stationary point occurs at

[formula]

After this, the analysis proceeds exactly as in the simplified case. Once more, the stationary point (,) in field space is given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:barsigg]) up to small corrections, and the energy density at the true vacuum (,) is given (up to corrections of O(ε4)) by ([\ref=eq:vbar]). Thus, in the general case, the energy density at (,) is lower than at σ = G = 0. The masses (to leading order in ε) are as before:

[formula]

The result of all this is a dilaton mass

[formula]

The Decay of the Dilaton

From the mass matrix ([\ref=eq:msq]) and the eigenvalues ([\ref=eq:masses]), it is seen that the dilaton eigenstate [formula] differs from the uncoupled σ by terms of O(ε):

[formula]

so that the coupling of the dilaton to standard model gauge fields can be obtained from ([\ref=eq:sigf]). This immediately yields a lifetime

[formula]

so that the decay of the dilaton precedes (or is coincident with) the electroweak era [\cite=glueball] .Thus, even if a large amount of energy resides in the oscillations of the dilaton field about its minimum, the reheating caused by its decay would not endanger nucleosynthesis [\cite=dilatondecay] or even anomalous baryosynthesis [\cite=kuzmin],[\cite=hg].

Conclusions

It has been shown that the mixing of a dilaton with a heavy scalar glueball, asdetermined by the canonical coupling of the dilaton, will result in a dilatonof mass ~  Λ2 / mPl, where Λ is the confinement scale of the gauge theory. The result is due to a specific interplay of the mass of the glueball and the size of the coupling. A quartic stabilization of the dilaton potential is necessary for the dynamics, but the magnitude of the coupling plays no role (to leading order in Λ / mPl) in determining the mass or the coupling of the physical dilaton. Finally, the large mass of the dilaton is shown to circumvent the usual cosmological problems associated with its existence.
