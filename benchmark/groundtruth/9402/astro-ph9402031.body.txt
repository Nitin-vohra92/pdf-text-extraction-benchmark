MONOPOLES AS BIG AS A UNIVERSE Andrei Linde, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-4060, USA

ABSTRACT

Introduction

1. One of the main purposes of inflationary cosmology was to solve the primordial monopole problem. The solution was very simple: inflation exponentially increases the distance between monopoles and makes their density negligibly small. It was assumed that inflation neither can change internal properties of monopoles nor can it lead to their copious production. For example, in the first version of the new inflation scenario based on the SU(5) Coleman-Weinberg theory [\cite=b16] the Hubble constant during inflation was of the order 1010 GeV, which is five orders of magnitude smaller than the mass of the X-boson MX  ~  1015 GeV. The size of a monopole given by ~  M- 1X is five orders of magnitude smaller than the curvature of the universe given by the size of the horizon H- 1. It seemed obvious that such monopoles simply could not know that the universe is curved.

This conclusion finds an independent confirmation in the calculation of the probability of spontaneous creation of monopoles during inflation. According to [\cite=GuthVil], this probability is suppressed by a factor of exp ( - 2πm / H), where m is the monopole mass. In the model discussed above this factor is given by ~  10- 106, which is negligibly small.

Despite all these considerations, in the present paper (see also [\cite=LL]) we will show that in many theories, including the SU(5) Coleman-Weinberg theory, monopoles, as well as other topological defects, do expand exponentially and can be copiously produced during inflation. The main reason is very simple. In the center of a monopole the scalar field φ always vanishes. This means that monopoles always stay on the top of the effective potential at φ  =  0. When inflation begins, it makes the field φ almost homogeneous and very close to zero near the center of the monopole. This provides excellent conditions for inflation inside the monopole. If inflation is supported by the vacuum energy V(0), the conditions for inflation remain satisfied inside the monopoles even after inflation finishes outside them. An outside observer will consider such monopoles as magnetically charged Reissner-Nordström black holes. A typical distance between such objects will be exponentially large, so they will not cause any cosmological problems. However, each such magnetically charged black hole will have an inflationary universe inside it. And, as we are going to argue, each such inflationary universe will contain many other inflating monopoles, which after inflation will look like black holes with inflationary heart. We will call such configurations fractal monopoles, or, more generally, fractal topological defects.

2. To explain the basic idea in a more detailed way, we will consider first the simple model with the Lagrangian

[formula]

where φ is a real scalar field. Symmetry breaking in this model leads to formation of domains with φ  =    ±  η, where [formula]. These domains are divided by domain walls (kinks) which interpolate between the two minima. Let us for a moment neglect gravitational effects. In this case one can easily obtain a solution for a static domain wall in the yz plane:

[formula]

Now let us see whether our neglect of gravitational effects is reasonable. The potential energy density in the center of the kink ([\ref=2]) at x  =  0 is equal to [formula], the gradient energy is also equal to [formula]. This energy density remains almost constant at [formula], and then it rapidly decreases. Gravitational effects can be neglected if the Schwarzschild radius [formula] corresponding to the distribution of matter with energy density [formula] and radius R  ~  m- 1 is much smaller than R. Here [formula]. This condition suggests that gravitational effects can be neglected for [formula]. In the opposite case,

[formula]

gravitational effects can be very important.

This result remains true for other topological defects as well. For example, recently it was shown that monopoles in the theory with the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking [formula] form Reissner-Nordström black holes [\cite=Lee]. It remained unnoticed, however, that the same condition, [formula], is simultaneously a condition of inflation at φ  ≪  η in the model ([\ref=1]).

Indeed, inflation occurs at φ  ≪  η in the model ([\ref=1]) if the curvature of the effective potential V(φ) at φ  ≪  η is much smaller than 3H2, where [formula] is the Hubble constant supported by the effective potential [\cite=MyBook]. This gives m2  ≪  2πλη4   /   M2P, which leads to the condition almost exactly coinciding with ([\ref=3]): [formula].

This coincidence by itself does not mean that domain walls and monopoles in the theories with [formula] will inflate. Indeed, inflation occurs only if the energy density is dominated by the vacuum energy. As we have seen, for the wall ([\ref=2]) this was not the case: gradient energy density for the solution ([\ref=2]) near x  =  0 is equal to the potential energy density. However, this is correct only after inflation and only if gravitational effects are not taken into account.

At the initial stages of inflation the field φ is equal to zero. Even if originally there were any gradients of this field, they rapidly become exponentially small. Each time Δt  =  H- 1 new perturbations with the amplitude [formula] and the wavelength ~  H- 1 are produced, but their gradient energy density ~  H4 is always much smaller than V(φ) for V(φ)  ≪  M4P [\cite=LLM].

Formation of domain walls in this scenario can be explained as follows. Assume that in the beginning the field φ inside some domain of initial size O(H- 1) was equal to zero. It did not move classically at that time, since V'(0)  =  0. However, within the time Δt  =  H- 1 fluctuations of the field φ were generated, which looked like sinusoidal waves with an amplitude [formula] and wavelength ~  H- 1. During this time the original domain grows in size e times, its volume grows e3  ~  20 times. Therefore it becomes divided into 20 domains of a size of the horizon H- 1. Evolution of the field inside each of them occurs independently of the processes in the other domains (no-hair theorem for de Sitter space). In a half of these domains scalar field will have average value φ  ≈    +  H  /  2π, in other domains it will have average value φ  ≈    -  H  /  2π. After that, the field φ begins its classical motion. In those domains where the resulting amplitude of the fluctuations is positive, the field φ moves towards the minimum of the effective potential at φ  =    +  η; in other domains it moves towards φ  =    -  η. These domains become separated by the domain walls with φ  =  0. However, as we already mentioned, at this stage the gradient energy near these walls is similar to H4  ~  V2(φ) / M4P, which is much smaller than V(φ) for V(φ)  ≪  M4P. Thus, domain walls continue expanding exponentially in all directions.

Domain wall formation is not completed at this point yet. Indeed, the field φ may jump back from the region with φ  >  0 to φ  <  0. However, the probability of such jumps is smaller than 1 / 2, and it becomes even much smaller with a further growth of |φ|. What is more important, the typical wavelength of new fluctuations remains H- 1, whereas the previously formed domains with φ  ~    ±  H  /  2π continue growing exponentially. Therefore the domains with negative φ produced by the jumps of the field φ will appear inside domains with positive φ, but they will look like small islands with φ  <  0 inside the sea with φ > 0. This means that the subsequent stages of inflation cannot destroy the originally produced domain walls; they can only produce new domain walls on a smaller length scale. These new walls will be formed only in those places where the scalar field is sufficiently small for the jumps with the change of the sign of the field φ to be possible. Therefore the new walls will be created predominantly near the old ones (where φ  =  0), thus forming a fractal domain wall structure.

3. Similar effects occur in more complicated models where instead of a discrete symmetry φ  →    -  φ we have a continuous symmetry. For example, instead of the model ([\ref=1]) one can consider a model

[formula]

where φ is a complex scalar field, [formula]. Spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry in this theory may produce global cosmic strings. Each string contains a line with φ  =  0. Outside this line the absolute value of the field φ increases and asymptotically approaches the limiting value [formula]. This string will be topologically stable if the isotopic vector (φ1(x),φ2(x)) rotates by 2nπ when the point x takes a closed path around the string.

The next step is to consider a theory with O(3) symmetry,

[formula]

where [formula] is a vector (φ1,φ2,φ3). This theory admits global monopole solutions. The simplest monopole configuration contains a point x  =  0 with φ(0)  =  0 surrounded by the scalar field [formula]. Asymptotically this field approaches regime with [formula].

The most important feature of strings and monopoles is the existence of the points where φ  =  0. Effective potential has an extremum at φ  =  0, and if the curvature of the effective potential is smaller than [formula], space around the points with φ  =  0 will expand exponentially, just as in the domain wall case considered above.

Now we will add gauge fields. We begin with the Higgs model, which is a direct generalization of the model ([\ref=5]):

[formula]

Here Dμ is a covariant derivative of the scalar field, which in this simple case (Abelian theory) is given by ∂μ  -  ieAμ. In this model strings of the scalar field contain magnetic flux Φ  =  2π / e. This flux is localized near the center of the string with φ(x)  =  0, for the reason that the vector field becomes heavy at large φ, see e.g. [\cite=Kirzhnits]. However, if inflation takes place inside the string, then the field φ becomes vanishingly small not only at the central line with φ(x)  =  0, but even exponentially far away from it. In such a situation the flux of magnetic field will not be confined near the center of the string. The thickness of the flux will grow together with the growth of the universe. Since the total flux of magnetic field inside the string is conserved, its strength will decrease exponentially, and very soon its effect on the string expansion will become negligibly small. A deep underlying reason for this behavior is the conformal invariance of massless vector fields. Energy density of such fields decreases as a(t)- 4, where a(t) is a scale factor of the universe. The final conclusion is that the vector fields do not prevent inflation of strings. The condition for inflation to occur inside the string remains the same as before: the curvature of the effective potential at φ  =  0 should be smaller than [formula].

The final step is to consider magnetic monopoles. A simplest example is given by the O(3) theory

[formula]

Global monopoles of the theory ([\ref=5]) become magnetic monopoles in the theory ([\ref=5a]). They also have φ  =  0 in the center. Vector fields in the center of the monopole are massless (gφ  =  0). During inflation these fields exponentially decrease, and therefore they do not affect inflation of the monopoles.

We should emphasize that even though the field φ around the monopole during inflation is very small, its topological charge is well defined, it cannot change and it cannot annihilate with the charge of other monopoles as soon as the radius of the monopole becomes greater than H- 1. However, an opposite process is possible. Just as domain walls can be easily produced by quantum fluctuations near other inflating domain walls, pairs of monopoles can be produced in the vicinity of an inflationary monopole. The distance between these monopoles grow exponentially, but the new monopoles will appear in the vicinity of each of them. This picture has been confirmed by the results of computer simulation of this process [\cite=LL].

Note that in the simple models discussed above inflation of monopoles occurs only if spontaneous symmetry breaking is extremely strong, [formula]. However, this is not a necessary condition. Our arguments remain valid for all models where the curvature of the effective potential near φ  =  0 is smaller than the Hubble constant supported by V(0). This condition is satisfied by all models which were originally proposed for the realization of the new inflationary universe scenario. In particular, the monopoles in the SU(5) Coleman-Weinberg theory also should expand exponentially. However, to make sure that we do not miss something important, we should resolve the paradox formulated in the very beginning of this paper: The Hubble constant H during inflation in the SU(5) Coleman-Weinberg theory is much smaller than the mass of the vector field MX, which is usually related to the size of the monopole. In such a situation inflation of the interior of the monopole does not seem possible.

This objection is very similar to the argument that the domain wall should not inflate since its gradient energy density is equal to its potential energy density. The resolution of the paradox is very similar. The effective mass of the vector field MX  ~  gη  ~  1015 GeV can determine an effective size of the monopole only after inflation. Effective mass of the vector field MX(φ)  ~  gφ is always equal to zero in the center of the monopole. Once inflation begins in a domain of a size O(H- 1) around the center of the monopole, it expels vectors fields away from the center and does not allow them to penetrate back as far as inflation continues.

4. It is well known that in many versions of inflationary theory some parts of the universe expand without end [\cite=b51]-[\cite=b19]. Our results reveal a very nontrivial role which topological defects may play in this process. For example, in the theory with breaking of a discrete symmetry φ  →    -  φ the universe in the source of its evolution becomes divided into many thermalized regions divided by exponentially expanding domain walls unceasingly producing new inflating walls. It is important that inflation never stops near the walls. Some of these walls could collapse, eating the island of thermalized phase inside them. However, it does not seem possible. Due to the no-hair theorem for de Sitter space, the part of the universe near the wall (i.e. near φ  =  0) lives by its own laws and continue expanding exponentially all the time. Thus, the walls become indestructible sources of eternal inflation, which produce new inflating walls, which produce new walls, etc. Far away from the walls, the field φ relaxes near φ  =    ±  η. However, due to the exponential expansion of space near the walls, they always remain exponentially thick and never approach the thin wall solution described by eq. ([\ref=2]).

The picture of eternally inflating universe consisting of islands of thermalized phase surrounded by inflating domain walls is very similar to a picture which appears in old inflation and in the versions of new inflation where the state φ  =  0 is sufficiently stable [\cite=b51]-[\cite=b62]. However, in our model the main reason for this behavior is purely topological [\cite=LL]. If inflation in this theory begins at large φ, as in the simplest models of chaotic inflation, then the universe will not consist of islands of thermalized phase surrounded by de Sitter space. On the contrary, it will consist of islands of inflationary universe surrounded by the thermalized phase [\cite=LLM]. Nevertheless, inflation in this case will go eternally due to the process of self-reproduction of inflationary domains with large φ [\cite=b19].

The results of computer simulations performed in [\cite=LL] suggest that in the theories with continuous symmetry breaking, which allow existence of inflating strings and monopoles, the global structure of the universe is similar to the structure of the universe in the simplest versions of chaotic inflation. The universe will consist of islands of inflationary phase associated with inflating monopoles (or of lines of inflationary phase associated with inflating strings) surrounded by thermalized phase. Since monopoles are topologically stable, and field φ is equal to zero in their centers, they form indestructible sources of inflation. The structure of space-time near each such monopole is very complicated; it should be studied by the methods developed in [\cite=Berezin] for description of a bubble of de Sitter space immersed into vacuum with vanishing energy density. Depending on initial conditions, many possible configurations may appear. The simplest one is the monopole which looks like a small magnetically charged black hole from the outside, but which contains a part of exponentially expanding space inside it. This is a wormhole configuration similar to those studied in [\cite=Markov]-[\cite=Tkachev]. The physical interpretation of this configuration can be given as follows [\cite=Berezin] [\cite=Tkachev]. An external observer will see a small magnetically charged Reissner-Nordström black hole. This part of the picture is consistent with the results obtained in [\cite=Lee]. On the other hand, an observer near the monopole will see himself inside an eternally inflating part of the universe. These two parts of the universe will be connected by a wormhole. Note that the wormhole connecting inflationary magnetic monopole to our space cannot evaporate unless the inflationary universe can loose its magnetic charge.

At the quantum level the situation becomes even more interesting. As we already mentioned, fluctuations of the field φ near the center of a monopole are strong enough to create new regions of space with φ  =  0, some of which will become monopoles. After a while, the distance between these monopoles becomes exponentially large, so that they cannot annihilate. This process of monopole-antimonopole pair creation produces a fractal structure consisting of monopoles created in the vicinity of other monopoles. Each of these monopoles in the process of its further evolution will evolve into a black hole containing inflationary universe containing many other monopoles, etc. That is why we call them fractal monopoles.

Note that one of the main motivations for the development of inflationary cosmology was a desire to get rid of primordial monopoles. However, the original version of the new inflationary universe scenario based on the theory of high temperature phase transitions did not work particularly well, since it required rather unnatural initial conditions [\cite=MyBook]. Fortunately, the same potentials which gave rise to new inflation can be used in the context of the chaotic inflation scenario, which does not require the whole universe being in a state of thermal equilibrium with φ  =  0. If these initial conditions can be realized at least in one domain of initial size O(H- 1), the universe enters the stage of eternal inflation. Of course, this possibility is still rather problematic since in the models used in the new inflationary universe scenario the size O(H- 1) is many orders of magnitude greater than the Planck length. For example, the probability of quantum creation of inflationary universe in the new inflationary universe scenario is suppressed by an infinitesimally small factor [formula] [\cite=Creation]. Therefore it is much easier for inflation to begin and continue eternally in the simplest chaotic inflation models where inflation is possible even at H  ~  MP, V(φ)  ~  M4P [\cite=LLM] [\cite=b19]. Still the problem of initial conditions in the models with the potentials used in the new inflationary scenario does not look that bad if one takes into account that inflation in these models also goes on without end [\cite=b52] [\cite=b62], and eventually we become generously rewarded for our initial problems by the infinite growth of the total volume of inflationary domains. Moreover, as it was shown in [\cite=LLM], the problem of initial conditions for the models with the potentials used in the new inflationary scenario can be easily solved by a preceding stage of chaotic inflation. Now we encounter a new amazing twist of this scenario. Eternal inflation begins if initially we have at least one inflating monopole. The possibility that monopoles by themselves solve the monopole problem is so simple that it certainly deserves further investigation.
