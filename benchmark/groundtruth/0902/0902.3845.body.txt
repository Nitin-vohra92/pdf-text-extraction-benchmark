A 2-basic set of the alternating group

Introduction

This note is concerned with the existence problem of basic sets for finite groups. Let G be a finite group and p be a prime. A p-basic set of G is a subset B of the set [formula] of irreducible complex characters of G, such that the restrictions Bp  =  {χp,  χ∈B} to p-regular elements (i.e., the elements of G with order prime to p) of the characters in B form a [formula]-basis of the ring of p-Brauer characters of G. Gerhard Hiss has conjectured that every finite group has a p-basic set. It is actually proved for some finite groups (see for example [\cite=GH], [\cite=GeckBS], [\cite=GeckBS3] and [\cite=Br1]), but it remains open and a difficult question in general.

Recently, the authors proved in [\cite=BrGr] that the alternating group [formula] has a p-basic set for any odd prime p. In this note, we complete this work by constructing a 2-basic set of [formula].

Recall that the irreducible characters of the symmetric group [formula] are naturally labelled by the partitions of n [\cite=James-Kerber]. We denote by P (respectively Pn) the set of all partitions of all integers (respectively of n). For any λ∈P, we write |λ| for the size of λ. For any partition λ of n (written [formula] in the following), we denote by χλ the corresponding irreducible character of [formula] and by λ* the conjugate partition of λ. Then χλ*  =  εχλ, where ε is the signature of [formula]. A partition λ is said to be self-conjugate if λ  =  λ*.

For any [formula], we call restriction of B to [formula] the subset [formula] of [formula] consisting of all the irreducible constituents of the restrictions to [formula] of the characters in B. To prove the existence of a p-basic set of [formula] for odd prime p, the approach in [\cite=BrGr] consists in constructing a p-basic set B of [formula] satisfying two additional properties which ensure that [formula] is a p-basic set of [formula] (cf. [\cite=BrGr]).

We will see that, when p = 2, we can use a similar strategy, by requiring the single additional property that B contains all characters labelled by self-conjugate partitions; namely, we will prove

If B is a 2-basic set of [formula] containing every [formula] with λ  =  λ*, then the restriction [formula] of B to [formula] is a 2-basic set of [formula].

The aim of this paper is to adapt the methods of [\cite=BrGr] (some of which heavily relie on p being odd) to the case p = 2, in order to construct a 2-basic set of [formula] satisfying Proposition [\ref=resAn].

Let [formula] be a partition of n. We denote by αλ = (λ(1),λ(2)) the 2-quotient of λ. Note that this is only defined up to a choice of convention. However, it is proved in [\cite=BrGr] (cf. the proof of Lemma 3.1) that, for a certain choice, we have that, for any n and any [formula], if αλ = (λ(1),λ(2)), then αλ* = (λ(2)*,λ(1)*). From now on, we always assume this to be the case. Then our main result is

For every integer m, we set

[formula]

Define

[formula]

Then the set BΛ of irreducible characters χλ of [formula] satisfying αλ∈Λ is a 2-basic set of [formula]. Moreover the restriction [formula] of BΛ to [formula] is a 2-basic set of [formula].

Throughout this article, we will use the following notations and conventions. For G a finite group, [formula] denotes the set of complex irreducible characters of G. For [formula], we denote by [formula] the character defined by [formula]. Let H and K be two finite groups. For [formula] and [formula], we define [formula] by

[formula]

For c a conjugacy class of G and χ a character of G, we sometimes will use the notation χ(c) for χ(g) for g∈c.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=part1], we prove Proposition [\ref=resAn]. In Section [\ref=part2], we construct, for each integer w, a [formula]-basis of the ring [formula] of virtual characters of [formula] that we will need in order to prove Theorem [\ref=main]. Finally, in Section [\ref=part3], we prove Theorem [\ref=main].

Restriction to [formula] of 2-basic sets of [formula]

We first prove the following lemma.

With the above notation, if [formula], then χ2λ  =  χ2λ*.

Let σ be an element of [formula] with odd order. Write [formula] as product of disjoint cycles. Since the order of σ is odd, each of the ci's must have odd length, so that ε(σ) = 1. Since χλ*  =  εχλ, this yields the claim.

Irreducible characters of [formula]

The construction and the values of the irreducible characters of [formula] are described in [\cite=James-Kerber]. For the convenience of the reader, we briefly recall how to parametrize them from those of [formula]. Take any [formula], and let

[formula]

If λ  ≠  λ*, then ρλ  =  ρλ* is irreducible, and [formula]. Otherwise, ρλ is the sum of two irreducible characters of [formula], written ρλ,  ±, and chosen as follows. If [formula], then we let [formula].The conjugacy class of [formula] of cycle type [formula] consists of elements of [formula], and splits into two classes [formula] of [formula]. Now, if [formula] doesn't have cycle type [formula], then ρλ, +(x) = ρλ, -(x). If [formula], then ρλ,  ±(x+) = sλ  ±  tλ and ρλ,  ±(x-) = sλ,  ∓  tλ, with sλ and tλ as described in [\cite=James-Kerber]. Furthermore, [formula].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=resAn]

The proof of Proposition [\ref=resAn] is based on the proof of [\cite=BrGr]. Suppose that B is a 2-basic set of [formula] as in Proposition [\ref=resAn] and consider its restriction [formula] to [formula]. To prove that [formula] is a 2-basic set of [formula] we have to show that [formula] is free and generates over [formula] the ring [formula].

We denote by S the set of self-conjugate partition of n and by T the set of partitions of n such that λ∈T if and only if χλ∈B. Put [formula]. With this notation, we have

[formula]

Suppose that there are integers aλ (λ∈S') and bλ,  ± (λ∈S) such that

[formula]

For λ∈S', we have λ*∉S'. Indeed, since χ2λ  =  χ2λ* (see Lemma [\ref=ressign]), we cannot have χλ∈B and χλ*∈B simultaneously because B2 is free. Hence, for λ∈S', there is no λ'∈S' satisfying

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] implies

[formula]

(Note that this holds because, for any class function α of [formula], we have [formula].) Therefore, inducing Relation ([\ref=eqlibre]) from [formula] to [formula] we deduce

[formula]

But B2 is free, implying aλ = 0 for λ∈S' and bλ, + + bλ, - = 0. Relation ([\ref=eqlibre]) gives

[formula]

Now, using the fact that ρλ, + and ρλ, - only differ on the conjugacy classes labelled by [formula] and [formula] we deduce that [formula] is free (we use here the same argument as in the proof of [\cite=BrGr]).

We now prove that [formula] generates [formula] over [formula]. Let ρ be a character of [formula] which does not belong to [formula]. The definition of [formula] implies that there is [formula] with λ  ≠  λ*, such that ρ  =  ρλ. In particular, as explained in §[\ref=charAn] we have

[formula]

Since B is a 2-basic set of [formula], there exist integers {aχ,  χ∈B} satisfying

[formula]

Restricting this last relation to [formula], we see that [formula] is a [formula]-linear combination of elements of [formula]. This yields the claim.

A 2-basic set of [formula]

A result on wreath products with cyclic kernel

Throughout this section, we fix [formula] and w positive integers and put

[formula]

where [formula] denotes a cyclic group of order [formula]. We denote by ω a generator of [formula] and set [formula] , with the convention that ψ1 is the trivial character of [formula]. In the following, we denote by [formula] the set of [formula]-tuples of partitions [formula] such that [formula].

We recall that the conjugacy classes of [formula] are parametrized by the elements of [formula] as follows. The elements of [formula] are of the form (h,σ) with [formula] and [formula]. For any k-cycle [formula] in σ, we define

[formula]

Let [formula] be the cycle structure of σ. We then form the corresponding [formula]-tuples of partitions [formula] by adding a k-cycle to μi whenever c∈s(σ) is a k-cycle satisfying g((h,σ),c) = ωi - 1. The resulting [formula]-tuple [formula] lies in [formula] and is the so-called cycle structure of (h,σ). Two elements of [formula] are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure.

We define

[formula]

Using σ  ↦  (1,σ), we can identify [formula] to a subgroup of [formula]. Note that [formula] is in the class of [formula] labelled by the partition [formula] if and only if (1,μ1) lies in the class of [formula] with cycle structure [formula].

We recall that the irreducible characters of [formula] are also labelled by the elements of [formula] as follows. Let [formula]. Consider the character

[formula]

If [formula] denotes the inertial subgroup of [formula] in [formula], then

[formula]

Moreover, [formula] can be extended to an irreducible character [formula] of [formula] by setting [formula] for [formula] and [formula]. The irreducible character [formula] corresponding to [formula] is then given by

[formula]

where χμi denotes the irreducible characters of [formula] corresponding to the partition μi of |μi|.

For [formula], write [formula] for the corresponding Young subgroup of [formula]. Define [formula] as in Formula ([\ref=eqtheta]) and put

[formula]

where χμi denotes the irreducible character of [formula] corresponding to [formula]. Then, for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Let [formula]. We fix [formula] in the conjugacy class of [formula] labelled by [formula]. Using [\cite=James-Kerber], we deduce

[formula]

where a1k(x) denotes the number of k-parts of the first partition of the cycle structure of x. Denote by ak(π) the number of k-parts of π. Then we have a1k(x) = ak(π) and [\cite=James-Kerber] implies

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Then, if we suppose that [formula], it follows that

[formula]

Furthermore, applying Formula ([\ref=eqcent]) with [formula], we deduce

[formula]

Therefore, the induction formula for characters gives

[formula]

where [formula] is defined in Equation ([\ref=eqphimu]) and {xi,  i∈I} is a system of representatives for the conjugacy classes of [formula] such that xi and x are conjugate in [formula]. However, as explained in Remark [\ref=rkinjection], the cycle structure of xi in [formula] lies in [formula]. Then, for each i∈I, there is [formula] such that the cycle structure of xi in [formula] is [formula]. Hence, we have

[formula]

because [formula]. Moreover, [\cite=BrGr] implies that the elements xi are conjugate in [formula] if and only if the elements ηi are conjugate in [formula]. We then deduce that the elements {ηi,i∈I} form a system of representatives for the conjugacy classes of [formula] such that π and ηi are conjugate in [formula]. It then follows that

[formula]

A [formula]-basis of the character ring of [formula]

Fix a positive integer w. In this section, we will construct a new [formula]-basis of the character ring of [formula].

For [formula], we define

[formula]

We put

[formula]

where P2w' is the set of partitions defined in Theorem [\ref=main].

The set Bw is a [formula]-basis of the ring [formula].

For [formula], we define

[formula]

Note that the map [formula] is a bijection between Pw and P2w'. It follows that [formula]. Then, to prove that Bw is a [formula]-basis of [formula], it is sufficient to prove that Bw is a generating family over [formula]. Let [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

where, for each [formula], cλμμ is the Littelwood-Richardson coefficient associated to the partitions μ, μ and λ. If we arrange the partitions of w in lexicographic order, then [\cite=GP] implies that the matrix

[formula]

is a lower triangular matrix with diagonal entries equal to 1. In particular, P is invertible over [formula]. Then, using P- 1 we can write the characters [formula] for [formula] as a linear combination of elements of Bw with coefficients in [formula]. This yields the claim.

A generalized perfect isometry

First, we will briefly present the notion of generalized perfect isometry, introduced in [\cite=KOR] by Külshammer, Olsson and Robinson. For a union C of conjugacy classes of a finite group G, we say that two irreducible characters α and β are orthogonal across C if

[formula]

Then, we define the C-blocks of G to be the minimal non-empty subsets of [formula] subject to being orthogonal across C. For [formula], we write (b,C) to indicate that b is a union of C-blocks. Then a bijection I:b  →  b' is a generalized perfect isometry (with respect to C and C' between two unions of blocks (b,C) and (b',C') of G and H, if there are signs {η(α)  |  α∈b} such that, for all α,  β∈b,

[formula]

Let w be a positive integer. In the following, we put

[formula]

Note that, with the notation of Section [\ref=sectionwr], we have Gw = G2,w. We can then apply the results of Section [\ref=sectionwr] to Gw. In particular, the irreducible characters of Gw are labelled by the set 2,w and the character corresponding to [formula] is denoted by [formula]. We also denote by [formula] the set of elements of Gw with cycle structure [formula] for some [formula].

In order to describe [\cite=BrGr] for p = 2, we introduce a bijection on 2,w (denoted by [formula]) defined by

[formula]

This definition comes from [\cite=JB], on which  [\cite=BrGr] is based, and counter-balances the appearance in the Murnaghan-Nakayama Formula for Gw of some negative signs, coming from the fact that ψ2( - 1) =  - 1.

In order to give the main result of this section, we have to recall some definitions. For [formula], we denote by γ(λ) the 2-core of λ ([\cite=James-Kerber]). Recall that two characters χλ1 and χλ2 are in the same 2-block of [formula] if and only if the partitions λ1 and λ2 have the same 2-core. Then the set of 2-blocks of [formula] can be labelled by the set of 2-cores of [formula]. For [formula], the integer [formula] is called the 2-weight of λ. Since irreducible characters of [formula] lying in the same 2-block have the same 2-core, it follows that the weight is an invariant of the block. We can thus define the weight of a block b as the weight of all characters in b. We now can state:

(cf. [\cite=BrGr]) Let n be a positive integer. Let b be a 2-block of [formula] of 2-weight w  ≠  0. For χλ∈b, write αλ∈2,w the 2-quotient of λ. We can associate to αλ the character θαλ defined in Formula ([\ref=eqphimu]). Then the map

[formula]

is a generalized perfect isometry between (b,2) and [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

We keep the notation of the above sections. Recall that, by [\cite=BrGr], it is possible to define 2-quotients of partitions in such a way that, for any n and any [formula], if αλ = (λ(1),λ(2)), then αλ* = (λ(2)*,λ(1)*). Moreover, note that if χλ lies in a 2-block of [formula] with 2-weight w, then |λ(1)| + |λ(2)| = w.

Let n be a positive integer and [formula]. Then λ is self-conjugate if and only if its 2-quotient has the form (μ,μ*). In particular, if w is the 2-weight of λ, then w has to be even.

Since αλ* = (λ(2)*,λ(1)*), it immediately follows that αλ = (λ(1),λ(1)*) whenever [formula] is a self-conjugate partition.

Using this, we can reduce Theorem [\ref=main] to the same question on 2-blocks of [formula] with even weight. More precisely, we have

The symmetric group [formula] has a 2-basic set containing every χλ with λ  =  λ* if and only if every 2-block b of [formula] with even weight w has a 2-basic set containing all χλ∈b with λ  =  λ*.

Using [\cite=BrGr], we can reduce the problem to the 2-blocks of [formula]. Let b be a 2-block of [formula] with odd weight. Lemma [\ref=2quotient] implies that if χλ∈b, then λ  ≠  λ*. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that b has a 2-basic set. For this, we use Theorem [\ref=perfectiso], which implies that [formula] is a generalized perfect isometry between (b,2) and [formula]. Moreover, if we denote by [formula] the set of irreducible characters of Gw labelled by elements of [formula], then Lemma [\cite=BrGr] implies [formula] is a [formula]-basic set of Gw. The result then follows from [\cite=BrGr].

The case of blocks of 2-weight 0 is easy to deal with. Such a block b consists of a unique irreducible character χλ of [formula], such that λ is a self-conjugate partition (since it is its own 2-core, and one shows easily that any 2-core must be self-conjugate). Hence {χλ} is a 2-basic set for b, which obviously satisfies the required property. We next solve the case of blocks with positive 2-weight.

Let b be a 2-block of [formula] with even weight 2w for some positive integer w. Then b has a 2-basic set containing all irreducible characters of b labelled by self-conjugate partitions.

Fix a 2-block b of [formula] with even 2-weight 2w. Theorem [\ref=perfectiso] implies that [formula] is a generalized perfect isometry between (b,2) and [formula]. We parametrize the irreducible characters of G2w by the elements of 2,2w as described above, and the character corresponding to [formula] will be denoted by [formula] as in Equation ([\ref=eqtheta]). Let χλ∈b with λ  =  λ*. Then, Lemma [\ref=2quotient] and the definition of J imply that

[formula]

Therefore, using [\cite=BrGr], we see that proving that b has a 2-basic set containing all irreducible characters of b labelled by self-conjugate partitions is equivalent to showing that the group G2w has a [formula]-basic set containing all irreducible characters of G2w labelled by bi-partitions of the form (μ,μ).

Let [formula] be the set of irreducible characters of G2w labelled by elements of [formula]. More precisely, the characters of [formula] are the characters of G2w with [formula] in their kernel. As we mentioned in Lemma [\ref=lemred], [formula] is a [formula]-basic set of G2w. Note that, for all [formula], we have

[formula]

However, [formula] doesn't have the required property. We will now construct from [formula] a [formula]-basic set containing the set of characters [formula]. Proposition [\ref=valind] implies that

[formula]

Note that Γ(μ,μ) is the character γμ defined in Formula ([\ref=definduit]). Furthermore, Formulae ([\ref=eqvalsym]) and ([\ref=eqvalinduit]) imply that, if we can find a [formula]-basis of [formula] containing the character γμ for every [formula] and the irreducible characters χλ for λ in some parametrizing set I, then the set of irreducible characters of Gw labelled by [formula] is a [formula]-basic set of G2w. We therefore get the desired result, with [formula], by Proposition [\ref=base].

Note that the generalized perfect isometry J of Theorem [\ref=perfectiso] is not one of the isometry described by Osima between b and [formula]. Indeed, Osima's isometry is a generalized perfect isometry between (b,2) and [formula] where [formula] is the set of elements of cycle structure (μ1,μ2)∈2,w with [formula]. It seems to be more difficult to prove a result similar to Proposition [\ref=basicset] for [formula].

We now can prove Theorem [\ref=main]. As explained in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemred], it is sufficient to construct a 2-basic set with the required property for all 2-blocks of [formula]. Let b be a 2-block of [formula] with weight w.

If w is odd, then we choose the 2-basic set Bb of b constructed in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemred]. In this case, Pw' is empty and the 2-quotients of the characters in Bb have the form [formula] with [formula].

If w is odd, then Proposition [\ref=basicset] implies that b has a 2-basic set Bb satisfying χλ∈Bb if and only if [formula] with [formula] or αλ = (μ,μ*) for [formula].

Thus, the set BΛ defined in Theorem [\ref=main] is a 2-basic set of [formula].
