The group [formula] is Roelcke precompact

Let (X,μ) be an atomless standard Borel probability space. We denote by [formula] the Polish group of measure preserving automorphisms of (X,μ) equipped with the weak topology. If for T∈G we let UT:L2(μ)  →  L2(μ) be the corresponding unitary operator (defined by UTf(x)  =  f(T- 1x)), then the map T  ↦  UT (the Koopman map) is a topological isomorphic embedding of the topological group G into the Polish topological group U(H) of unitary operators on the Hilbert space H  =  L2(μ) equipped with the strong operator topology. The image of G in U(H) under the Koopman map is characterized as the collection of unitary operators U∈U(H) for which [formula] and Uf  ≥  0 whenever f  ≥  0; see e.g. [\cite=G].

It is well known (and not hard to see) that the strong and weak operator topologies coincide on U(H) and that with respect to the weak operator topology, the group U(H) is dense in the unit ball Θ of the space B(H) of bounded linear operators on H. Now Θ is a compact space and as such it admits a unique uniform structure. The trace of the latter on U(H) defines a uniform structure on U(H). We denote by J the collection of Markov operators in Θ, where K∈Θ is Markov if [formula] and Kf  ≥  0 whenever f  ≥  0. It is easy to see that J is a closed subset of Θ. Clearly the image of G in U(H) is contained in J and it is well known that this image is actually dense in J (see e.g. [\cite=GK] or [\cite=GLW]). Thus, via the embedding of G into J we obtain also a uniform structure on G. We will denote this uniform space by (G,J).

On every topological group G there are two naturally defined uniform structures R(G) and L(G). The lower or the Roelcke uniform structure on G is defined as [formula]. If N is a base for the topology of G at the neutral element e, then with

[formula]

the collections {UR:U∈N} and {UL:U∈N} constitute bases for R(G) and L(G) respectively. A base for the Roelcke uniform structure is obtained by the collection {VU:U∈N} where

[formula]

In [\cite=U] Uspenskij shows that the uniform structure induced from Θ on U(H) coincides with the Roelcke structure of this group. In this note we show that the same is true for [formula] and then, as in [\cite=U], deduce that G is totally minimal (see the definition below).

The subject of Roelcke precompact (RPC) groups was thoroughly studied by Uspenskij. In addition to the paper [\cite=U] the interested reader can find more information about RPC groups in [\cite=U01], [\cite=U02] and [\cite=U08]. In [\cite=U01] the author shows that the group [formula] of self-homeomorphisms of the Cantor set C with the compact-open topology is RPC. See also [\cite=GM] where the Polish group [formula] of permutations of the natural numbers is shown to be RPC and where an alternative proof for the RPC property of [formula] is indicated.

[formula] is Roelcke precompact

The uniform structure induced from J on G coincides with the Roelcke uniform structure [formula]. Thus the Roelcke uniform structure on G is precompact and the natural embedding G  →  J is a realization of the Roelcke compactification of G.

Given ε > 0 and a finite measurable partition [formula] of X we set

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Note that sets of the form Wα,ε constitute a base for the uniform structure on G induced from J, while the W̃α,ε form a base for the Roelcke uniform structure on G.

If T  =  PSQ with P,Q∈Uα,ε then Thus W̃α,ε  ⊂  Wα,2ε. This means that the identity map [formula] is uniformly continuous.

For the other direction we start with a given W̃α,ε. Suppose (S,T)∈Wα,ε  /  n2. Set

[formula]

We have |μ(Aij)  -  μ(A'ij)|  <  ε  /  n2 for every i and j. Define a measure preserving R∈G as follows. For each pair i,j let Bij  ⊂  Aij with [formula] and μ(Bij)  ≤  μ(A'ij). Next choose a measure preserving isomorphism φij from Bij onto a subset B'ij  ⊂  A'ij and let [formula] be the map whose restriction to Bij is φij. Finally, extend φ to an element R∈G by defining R on [formula] to be any measure preserving isomorphism [formula].

It is easy to check that R is in Uα,ε, and for TR- 1S- 1 we have, up to sets of small measure,

[formula]

Thus also TR- 1S- 1 is in Uα,ε, whence the equation T  =  (TR- 1S- 1)SR implies (S,T)∈W̃α,ε. We have shown that Wα,ε  /  n2  ⊂  W̃α,ε and it follows that the identity map [formula] is also uniformly continuous.

The Roelcke and the WAP compactifications of G coincide. Moreover, every bounded right and left uniformly continuous function -- and hence also every WAP function -- on G can be uniformly approximated by linear combinations of positive definite functions. Or, in other words, every right and left uniformly continuous function arises from a Hilbert representation.

Let Ro(G), denote the algebra of bounded right and left uniformly continuous complex-valued functions on G. We write WAP(G) for the algebra of weakly-almost-periodic complex-valued functions on G and finally we let H(G) be the algebra of Hilbert complex-valued functions on G (i.e. the uniform closure of the algebra of all linear combinations of positive definite functions; the latter is also called the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra). We then have

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=main] these three algebras coincide for the topological group [formula]. In fact, the functions of the form Ff(T)  =  〈Tf,f〉 with f∈L2(μ) and T∈J, when restricted to G, are clearly positive definite. Since these functions generate the algebra C(J), which by Theorem [\ref=main] is canonically isomorphic to Ro(G), this shows that indeed Ro(G)  =  H(G).

[formula] is totally minimal

A topological group is called minimal if it does not admit a strictly coarser Hausdorff group topology. It is totally minimal if all its Hausdorff quotient groups are minimal. Stoyanov proved that the unitary group U(H) is totally minimal [\cite=S], [\cite=DPS], and Uspenskij provides in [\cite=U] an alternative proof based on his identification of Θ as the Roelcke compactification of this group. Using Theorem [\ref=main] we have the following.

The topological group [formula] is totally minimal.

For completeness we provide a proof of this theorem. It follows Uspenskij's proof with some simplifications. We will use though the next theorem of Uspenskij [\cite=U].

Let S be a compact Hausdorff semitopological semigroup which satisfies the following assumption:

For every pair of idempotents p,q∈S the conditions pq = p and qp = p are equivalent. (We write p  ≤  q when p,q∈S satisfy these conditions.)

Then every nonempty closed subsemigroup K of S contains a least idempotent; i.e. an idempotent p such that p  ≤  q for every idempotent q in K.

It is not hard to check that Θ (and therefore also J) satisfies the assumption of this theorem.

Let τ denote the topology of a Hausdorff topological group G and suppose that τ' is a coarser Hausdorff group topology. Then, the identity map (G,τ)  →  (G,τ') is continuous and τ  =  τ' iff this map is open. A moment's reflection now shows that in order to prove that G is totally minimal it suffices to check that every surjective homomorphism of Hausdorff topological groups f:G  →  G' is an open map.

So let f:G  →  G' be such a homomorphism and observe that then G' is Roelcke precompact and satisfies Ro(G')  =  WAP(G') as well. We denote by J' the corresponding (Roelcke and WAP) compactification of G' and observe that the dynamical systems (J,G) and (J',G') are their own enveloping semigroups (see e.g. [\cite=G]). Now, (J,G) and (J',G') being WAP systems, the latter are compact semitopological semigroups. Moreover, the map f:G  →  G' naturally extends to a continuous homomorphism F:J  →  J'. (This fact frees us from the need to use Proposition 2.1 from [\cite=U].)

Let K  =  F- 1(e'), where e' is the neutral element of G'. Clearly then K is a closed subsemigroup of J. Moreover, we have gK = Kg  =  F- 1(g') whenever g' = f(g)∈G'. In fact, clearly gK  ⊂  F- 1(g') and if F(q)  =  g' for some q∈J then F(g- 1q)  =  f(g- 1)F(q)  =  g'- 1g' = e', hence g- 1q∈K and q∈gK. Thus gK = F- 1(g') and symmetrically also Kg = F- 1(g').

Next observe that gKg- 1 = K for every g∈G. Thus if p is the least idempotent in K, provided by Theorem [\ref=idem], then gpg- 1 = p for all g∈G and we conclude (an easy exercise) that either p = I, the identity element of G, or p is the projection on the space of constant functions (i.e. the operator of integration on L2(X,μ)). In the second case we have e' = F(p) = F(gp)  =  f(g)F(p)  =  f(g)e' = f(g) for every g∈G and we conclude that G' = {e'}.

Suppose then that p  =  I. In that case we have qK  ⊂  K for every q∈K and qK being a closed subsemigroup, we conclude that I∈qK. Similarly we get I∈Kq. Whence q is an invertible element of J, i.e. an element of G. Thus when p = I we have K  ⊂  G.

Let now g be an arbitrary element of G and let g'  =  f(g)∈G'. Suppose G'∋f(gi)  =  g'i  →  g' is a convergent sequence in G'. With no loss in generality we assume that gi converges to an element q∈J and it then follows that F(q)  =  g'. As F- 1(g')  =  gK we conclude that q∈gK  ⊂  G. Now f(giq- 1g)  =  f(gi)  =  g'i and giq- 1g  →  g. This shows that f is an open map and the proof is complete.
