An algorithm to relate surface roughness with local geometry of protein exterior.

The concavity of the active sites of enzymes and the changes in their local geometry has long been recognized as key features to study their structure-function relationship (Lewis 1991; Pettit et al. 2007). Alongside this recognition, came the acceptance that change in surface roughness of patch of protein surface can serve as an equally useful marker, at least when attempting to find functional sites of that protein (Lewis and Rees 1985; Pettit and Bowie 1999). While there are works that successfully quantify important aspects of geometry of local shape of protein exterior (Laskowski et al. 1996; Peters et al. 1996; Liang et al. 1998; Brady and Stouten 2000); an algorithm that relates the local shape change to change of roughness of surface patch that holds this shape, is extremely difficult to find. The reason for this conspicuous absence can probably be attributed to the complex nature of functional dependencies that influence surface roughness of any given patch of protein surface. It is owing to these (seemingly innumerable) dependencies that the surface roughness appears to be an n - dimensional random variable. In this paper, we propose a simple yet rigorous algorithm that transforms the surface roughness description from that of a n - dimensional random variable to a system of simple algebraic equations. Further, we define a generalized index that captures the simultaneous changes in local geometry and the roughness of the patch of protein surface that engulfs it. It can immediately be recognized that the algebraic description of this complicated dependency problem is much easily implementable in computational form than the same in the realm of n - dimensional continuous random variables. Since the entire phenomenon of enzyme-inhibitor interaction (like most of the biological interactions) is time-dependent and context-dependent, the local shape of active site of enzyme is expected to undergo certain small yet significant change in its topography. Further, since any shape is necessarily coated with a surface, a minute change in the shape can account for a subtle change in the magnitude of surface roughness (at least potentially) too. Hence to describe the situation objectively, let

[formula]

be the corresponding vector of the state representing surface roughness (expressed with fractal dimensions) of the patch of the surface containing the aforementioned local shape. We define a function [formula], on which the functional [formula] attains a minimum. Since the magnitude of the functional [formula] has the capability to describe a change in either [formula] or s; the minimum magnitude of the functional will imply a state where the extent of change in [formula] follows the trend in extent of change in s, in the closest terms. Hence it is this minimum magnitude of the functional Z that we define as generalized index for studying the change in local shape of the enzyme active site, because only with this magnitude of functional Z, the change in both shape and surface roughness can be simultaneously described in the best objective manner. It is clear that the solution of the give problem is determined by the choice of the norm ||.||. To describe the situation from an unbiased perspective, we have considered F as an n - dimensional continuous random variable with correlation matrix C. We could then define [formula] as a predictor of a random variable s having a minimum mean square value. Thus the functional Z was re-written as :

where E represented the expectation operator and ps denoted the probability of occurrence of any arbitrarily chosen state of the shape, s. In the case where [formula] for all
