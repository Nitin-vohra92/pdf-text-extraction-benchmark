Killing fields of holomorphic Cartan geometries

Introduction

We study here holomorphic Cartan geometries on complex compact manifolds M.

Let G be a complex connected Lie group and P  ⊂  G a closed complex Lie subgroup. The Lie algebras of G and P will be denoted by [formula] and [formula].

If the image of P through the adjoint representation is an algebraic subgroup of [formula], the Cartan geometry is said to be of algebraic type.

Recall that a local Killing field of the Cartan geometry is a local holomorphic vector field on M which lifts to a vector field on B acting by bundle automorphisms and preserving ω. Denote by Killloc the Lie algebra of local Killing fields (recall that the sheaf of Killing fields on M is locally constant [\cite=Gro] (section 3.5)). If Killloc admits an open orbit U in M, we say that (B,ω) is locally homogeneous on U.

We show that, in many situations, a Cartan geometry of algebraic type admits a non trivial algebra Killloc of local Killing fields. This is inspired by the celebrated stratification theorem proved by Gromov in the context of rigid geometric structures of algebraic type [\cite=DG] [\cite=Gro] (see also the nice Cartan geometries-adapted proof given by Karin Melnick [\cite=Melnick]). Our result is:

Let M be a compact connected complex manifold of dimension n endowed with a holomorphic Cartan geometry (B,ω) of algebraic type. Then :

(i) There exists a compact analytic subset S of M, such that [formula] is Killloc-invariant and the orbits of Killloc in [formula] are the fibers of a holomorphic fibration of constant rank.

(ii) For any distinct fibers of the previous fibration there exists a fibration-invariant meromorphic function on M taking distinct values on them. Consequently, the dimension of the fibers is ≥  n - a(M), where a(M) is the algebraic dimension of M.

If a(M) = 0, then (B,ω) is locally homogeneous on an open dense set in M.

Let M be a compact simply connected complex manifold of positive dimension with trivial canonical bundle which doesn't admit nonconstant meromorphic functions. Then M doesn't admit holomorphic Cartan geometries of algebraic type.

This enables us to prove the following result which was our main motivation:

A compact Kähler Calabi-Yau manifold M bearing a holomorphic Cartan geometry of algebraic type admits a finite unramified cover which is a complex torus.

Benjamin McKay conjectured in [\cite=McKay] that compact Kähler Calabi-Yau manifolds bearing holomorphic Cartan geometries are holomorphically covered by complex tori. Theorem [\ref=on_Calabi-Yau] answers positively this conjecture in the case of Cartan geometries of algebraic type. In a recent paper [\cite=BM], Indranil Biswas and Benjamin McKay proved the conjecture in the case where M is a projective Calabi-Yau manifold.

Note that the particular case where P is the complex linear group [formula] sitting in the complex affine group [formula] corresponds to a holomorphic affine connexion on the holomorphic tangent bundle TM. This special case was proved in [\cite=IKO]. The conjecture was also solved in [\cite=McKay] for the particular case where P is parabolic or reductive.

A similar result was proved in [\cite=D1] for holomorphic rigid geometric structures of algebraic affine type in Gromov's sense [\cite=DG] [\cite=Gro], but the context here is different since the principal bundle B of a Cartan geometry is not supposed to be a frame bundle of the manifold M.

We give now the main steps in the proof of theorem [\ref=on_Calabi-Yau] in the case where M is a nonprojective Calabi-Yau manifold. If M is Kähler but nonprojective, a result of Moishezon [\cite=Moishezon] implies that the algebraic dimension of M is not maximal and theorem [\ref=result] implies that any Cartan geometry on M admits nontrivial local Killing fields. We use then a structure theorem which asserts that, up to a finite cover, M is biholomorphic to a direct product of a simply connected Calabi-Yau manifold with a complex torus [\cite=Beauville] and a result of Amores-Nomizu [\cite=Amores] [\cite=Nomizu] about the extendibility of local Killing fields on simply connected manifolds (see also [\cite=DG] [\cite=Gro] [\cite=Melnick]).

In the case where M is projective our proof works also for Cartan geometries which are not of algebraic type. It is a very simplified version of that given in [\cite=BM]. Actually, we obtain the more general:

Let N be a complex manifold.

(i) If M is a compact simply connected Kähler Calabi-Yau manifold of positive dimension, then M  ×  N doesn't admit holomorphic Cartan geometries of algebraic type.

(ii) If M is a compact simply connected projective Calabi-Yau manifold of positive dimension, then M  ×  N doesn't admit holomorphic Cartan geometries.

(iii) If M is a compact simply connected complex manifold of positive dimension with trivial canonical bundle KM (or such that K- 1M doesn't admit nontrivial holomorphic sections), then M  ×  N doesn't admit flat holomorphic Cartan geometries.

Moreover, the previous three points stand not only for M  ×  N, but also for complex manifolds W containing M as a submanifold such that there exists a holomorphic vector bundle morphism from TW|M onto TM.

After finishing this paper, we learnt from Benjamin McKay that himself and Indranil Biswas just succeeded to adapt the proof of [\cite=BM] for compact Kähler Calabi-Yau manifolds. Their new unpublished result uses Bogomolov's T-stability theory for coherent sheaves.

Killing fields of Cartan geometries

Let M be a complex manifold endowed with a Cartan geometry of algebraic type modeled on G / P.

We can assume without loss of generality that P contains no nontrivial normal subgroups of G. Indeed, if a nontrivial normal subgroup N of G lies in P, then M also admits a Cartan geometry (B / N,ω') locally modeled on G' / P', where G' = G / N and P' = P / N (see [\cite=Sharpe], chapter 4).

Remark that ω defines a holomorphic isomorphism [formula], where TB is the holomorphic tangent bundle to B.

The curvature of the Cartan geometry (B,ω) is a [formula]-valued (holomorphic) 2-form on B defined by Ω(X,Y) = dω(X,Y)  +  [ω(X),ω(Y)], for all tangent vector fields X,Y to B. It is well known that Ω(X,Y) vanishes if [formula] (see [\cite=Sharpe], chapter 5, corollary 3.10).

The Cartan geometry (B,ω) is said to be flat, if the curvature vanish to all of B.

Since [formula], the curvature Ω is completely determined by a P-equivariant function K:B  →  V, where [formula] and P acts linearly on V by

[formula]

for all p∈P, with [formula] being the induced P-action on [formula] coming from the adjoint action Ad(P) (see [\cite=Sharpe], chapter 5, lemma 3.23).

Following [\cite=Melnick] we define for all [formula], the m-jet of K with respect to ω:

[formula]

[formula]

where Xi∈TbB and i is the unique ω-constant (holomorphic) vector field on B which extends Xi.

The m-jet of K is P-equivariant:

[formula]

where Adm is the tensor representation [formula] of AdP (see proposition 3.1 in [\cite=Melnick]).

Conversely, a local bundle automorphism of B preserving ω is the lift of a unique local biholomorphism of M [\cite=Melnick] (proposition 3.6).

The pseudogroup of local automorphisms of a Cartan geometry is a Lie pseudogroup Isloc (of finite dimension) generated by the Killing Lie algebra of the Cartan geometry Killloc. We will say that m,n∈M are in the same Killloc-orbit if n can be reached from m by flowing along a finite sequence of local Killing fields. Locally the orbits of Isloc and the orbits of Killloc are the same.

The following well known lemma will be useful in the sequel (see also [\cite=Sharpe], Appendix A).

Let M be a complex manifold endowed with a holomorphic Cartan geometry (B,ω). The holomorphic [formula]-bundle [formula] over M corresponding to B by the adjoint action of the structure group P on [formula] admits a holomorphic affine connection.

It is enough to prove that the holomorphic principal G-bundle BG = B  ×  PG obtained by extending the structure group of B using the inclusion map of P in G admits a holomorphic connection [\cite=Kobayashi].

Consider [formula] be the [formula]-valued Maurer-Cartan one form on G constructed using the left invariant vector fields. Consider the [formula]-valued holomorphic one form

[formula]

on B  ×  G, where the πi are the canonical projections on the two factors. The one form [formula] descends on BG to a [formula]-valued holomorphic one form which defines a holomorphic connection.

(i) The proof of Lemma [\ref=connection] only requires points (ii) and (iii) in the definition of a Cartan geometry.

(ii) If the Cartan geometry (B,ω) is flat, then the holomorphic affine connection constructed in Lemma [\ref=connection] is easily seen to be flat.

Cartan geometries and algebraic dimension

The maximal number of algebraically independent meromorphic functions on a complex manifold M is called the algebraic dimension a(M) of M.

Recall that a theorem of Siegel proves that a complex n-manifold M admits at most n algebraically independent meromorphic functions [\cite=Ueno]. Then [formula] and for algebraic manifolds a(M) = n.

We will say that two points in M are in the same fiber of the algebraic reduction of M if any meromorphic function on M takes the same value at the two points. There exists some open dense set in M where the fibers of the algebraic reduction are the fibers of a holomorphic fibration on an algebraic manifold of dimension a(M) and any meromorphic function on M is the pull-back of a meromorphic function on the basis [\cite=Ueno].

Theorem [\ref=result] shows that the fibers of the algebraic reduction are in the same orbit of the pseudogroup of local isometries for any holomorphic Cartan geometry of algebraic type on M. Let's give the proof.

(i) For each positive integer m we consider the m-jet JmK of the curvature of (B,ω). This is a P-equivariant holomorphic map

[formula]

The proof of theorem 4.1 in [\cite=Melnick] shows that two points in M are in the same Killloc-orbit if and only if the corresponding fibers of B are sent on the same P-orbit in [formula], for a certain m large enough.

Since the Ad(P)-action on W is supposed to be algebraic, Rosenlicht's theorem (see [\cite=Ro]) shows that there exists a P-invariant stratification

[formula]

such that Zi + 1 is Zariski closed in Zi, the quotient of [formula] by P is a complex manifold and rational P-invariant functions on Zi separate orbits in [formula].

Consider the open dense Killloc-invariant subset U of M, where JmK is of constant rank and the image of B|U through JmK is contained in the maximal subset [formula] of the stratification which intersects the image of JmK. Then [formula], with S a compact analytic subset in M, and the orbits of Killloc in U are the fibers of a fibration of constant rank.

(ii) If n and n' are two points in U which are not in the same Killloc-orbit, then the corresponding fibers of B|U are sent by JmK on two distinct P-orbits in [formula]. By Rosenlicht's theorem there exists a P-invariant rational function [formula] which takes distincts values at these two orbits.

The meromorphic function [formula] is P-invariant and descends in a Killloc-invariant meromorphic function on M which takes distincts values at n and at n'.

Consequently, the complex codimension in U of the Killloc-orbits is ≤  a(M), which finishes the proof.

Cartan geometries and simply-connected manifolds

We prove first the corollary [\ref=corollaire].

Assume, by contradiction, that the complex manifold M bearing the Cartan geometry (B,ω) verifies the hypothesis. Since a(M) = 0, theorem [\ref=result] implies (B,ω) is locally homogeneous on an open dense set U in M. As M is simply connected, elements in the Killing Lie algebra G extend to all of M [\cite=Amores] [\cite=Gro] [\cite=Melnick] [\cite=Nomizu]: the unique connected simply connected complex Lie group G' associated to G acts isometrically on M with an open dense orbit. The open dense orbit U identifies with a homogeneous space G' / H, where H is a closed subgroup of G'.

Consider [formula] global Killing fields on M which are linearly independent at some point of the open orbit U. Consider the function [formula], where vol is the holomorphic volume form associated to a nontrivial section of the canonical bundle. Since [formula] is a holomorphic function on M, it is a nonzero constant (by maximum principle) and, consequently, [formula] are linearly independent on M. Hence Wang's theorem [\cite=Wang] implies that M is a quotient of a n-dimensional connected simply connected complex Lie group G1 by a discrete subgroup. Since M is simply connected, this discrete subgroup has to be trivial and M identifies with G1. But there is no compact simply connected complex Lie group: a contradiction.

Let M be a compact connected simply connected complex n-manifold without nonconstant meromorphic functions and admitting a holomorphic Cartan geometry (B,ω) of algebraic type. Then M is biholomorphic to an equivariant compactification of [formula], where Γ is a discrete noncocompact subgroup in a complex Lie group G'.

Since a(M) = 0, theorem [\ref=result] implies (B,ω) is locally homogeneous on an open dense set U. As before, the extension property of local Killing fields implies U is a complex homogeneous space G' / H, where G' is a connected simply connected complex Lie group and H is a closed subgroup in G'.

We show now that H is a discrete subgroup of G'. Assume by contradiction the Lie algebra of H is nontrivial. Take at any point u∈U, the isotropy subalgebra Hu (i.e. the Lie subalgebra of Killing fields vanishing at u). Remark that Hgu = Ad(g)Hu, for any g∈G' and u∈U, where Ad is the adjoint representation. Let d be the complex dimension of Hu.

The map u  →  Hu is a meromorphic map from M to the grassmanian of d-dimensional vector spaces in G. Since M doesn't admit nontrivial meromorphic function, this map has to be constant. It follows that Hu is Ad(G')-invariant and H is a normal subgroup of G': a contradiction, since the G'-action on M is faithful. Thus G' is of dimension n and H is a discrete subgroup Γ in G'.

As M is simply connected, U has to be strictly contained in M and M is an equivariant compactification of [formula].

We don't know if such compactifications of [formula] admit holomorphic Cartan geometries, but the previous result has the following application.

Recall that an open question asks whether the 6-dimensional real sphere S6 admits complex structures or no. In this context, we have the following:

If S6 admits a complex structure M, then M doesn't admit holomorphic Cartan geometries of algebraic type.

The starting point of the proof is a result of [\cite=CDP] where it is proved that M doesn't admit nonconstant meromorphic functions. If M admits a holomorphic Cartan geometry, then the previous proof shows that M supports a holomorphic action of a three-dimensional complex Lie group G' with an open orbit. This is in contradiction with the main theorem of [\cite=HKP].

Cartan geometries and Calabi-Yau manifolds

Recall that Kähler Calabi-Yau manifolds are Kähler manifolds with vanishing first (real) Chern class [\cite=Beauville].

The aim of this section is to prove theorem [\ref=on_Calabi-Yau]. We settle first the case where M is simply connected.

A simply connected Kähler Calabi-Yau manifold of positive dimension n doesn't admit holomorphic Cartan geometries of algebraic type.

Assume first M is nonprojective. A theorem of Moishezon [\cite=Moishezon] shows that the algebraic dimension of a Kähler nonprojective complex manifold of dimension n is ≤  n - 1. Theorem [\ref=result] implies then that the Killing Lie algebra of a Cartan geometry on M is nontrivial. Since M is simply-connected, a nontrivial element of the Killing Lie algebra extends to a global holomorphic (Killing) vector field on M [\cite=Amores] [\cite=Gro] [\cite=Melnick] [\cite=Nomizu].

But a simply connected compact Calabi-Yau manifold doesn't admit nontrivial holomorphic vector fields [\cite=Kobayashi-Horst]: a contradiction.

Consider now the case where M is projective. Assume by contradiction that M admits a Cartan geometry (B,ω) locally modelled on G / P.

Let [formula] (respectively [formula]) be the holomorphic vector bundle over M with fiber [formula] (respectively [formula]) associated to B and corresponding to the action of the structure group P on [formula] (respectively on [formula]) by the adjoint representation.

The point (i) in the definition of a Cartan geometry implies that the holomorphic tangent bundle TM is isomorphic to [formula] which is also the holomorphic vector bundle [formula] corresponding to the adjoint P-action on the quotient [formula].

Lemma [\ref=connection] shows that [formula] admits a holomorphic affine connection. By theorem A(1) in [\cite=Biswas], [formula] also admits a flat holomorphic affine connection. Since M is simply connected, [formula] is holomorphically trivial .

Let p be the canonical projection of [formula] onto TM. Choose [formula] global holomorphic sections of [formula] such that [formula] span TM at a chosen point in M. Then [formula] is a nontrivial holomorphic section of K- 1M, where KM is the canonical bundle of M. Since KM is trivial, the section [formula] doesn't vanish on M. Consequently, [formula] trivialize TM. Wang's theorem [\cite=Wang] implies that M is a complex torus: a contradiction (for M is supposed to be simply connected).

We give now the proof of theorem [\ref=on_Calabi-Yau].

Let M be a Kähler Calabi-Yau manifold bearing a holomorphic Cartan geometry (B,ω). It is known that, up to a finite unramified cover, M is biholomorphic to a product of nontrivial simply connected Kähler Calabi-Yau manifolds [formula] and a complex torus [formula], with Λ being a lattice in [formula] [\cite=Beauville].

Remark that the proof of lemma [\ref=CY] still works if at least one of the simply connected factors Mi is nonprojective. Indeed, in this case meromorphic functions on M don't separate points in the fibers [formula], with [formula], and the proof of theorem [\ref=result] shows that the foliation given by the Killloc-orbits intersects a generic fiber, say [formula], on a foliation with positive dimensional leaves. Hence we can choose a local Killing field X defined on a connected simply connected open set U in M which is tangent to [formula] at a given point [formula] and X(m)  ≠  0.

By Amores-Nomizu's extendibility result, X extends to a holomorphic Killing vector field [formula] on [formula], with U' being a simply connected open set in [formula] containing t. Consider the image of [formula] through the projection on the first factor of the canonical decomposition

[formula]

where the πi are the canonical projections on the simply connected factor and on the torus.

We constructed a holomorphic vector field on the simply connected Calabi-Yau manifold [formula]  which doesn't vanish at m. This is in contradiction with [\cite=Kobayashi-Horst] as before.

Consider now the remaining case where all simply connected factors Mi are projective. Assume, by contradiction, that [formula] is nontrivial.

Let [formula] (respectively [formula]) be the holomorphic vector bundle over M with fiber [formula] (respectively [formula]) associated to B and corresponding to the action of the structure group P on [formula] (respectively on [formula]) by the adjoint representation. As before TM is isomorphic to [formula]. Let p be the canonical projection of [formula] onto TM.

Let p1 (respectively p2) be the projections on the first factor (respectively second factor) of the decomposition

[formula]

Then [formula] is a surjective morphism of vector bundles. When restricted to a fiber [formula], this induces a surjective morphism [formula], where [formula] denotes the restriction of [formula] to [formula].

On the other hand, Lemma [\ref=connection] shows that [formula] admits a holomorphic affine connection. In particular, [formula] admits a holomorphic affine connection. By theorem A(1) in [\cite=Biswas], [formula] also admits a flat holomorphic affine connection. Since [formula] is simply connected, [formula] is holomorphically trivial. We obtained that [formula] is a quotient of a holomorphically trivial vector bundle. We conclude as in the proof of Lemma [\ref=CY].

Remark that, in the case where the simply connected factor [formula] is projective, the previous proof also works for Cartan geometries which are not necessarily of algebraic type.

Actually the previous proof doesn't use neither that the second factor of the holomorphic decomposition of a Calabi-Yau manifold as a product is a complex torus. In our proof this second factor might be any complex manifold N. This proves also points (i) and (ii) in theorem [\ref=produits]. Whereas for point (iii) of theorem [\ref=produits] we give the proof here:

Consider a flat Cartan geometry (B,ω) on M  ×  N and the associated vector bundle [formula] over M  ×  N. As before TM is a quotient of the vector bundle [formula], where [formula] denotes the restriction to the factor M of [formula].

Since the Cartan geometry (B,ω) is supposed to be flat, Lemma [\ref=connection] and Remark [\ref=hyp] (point (ii)) show that [formula] and hence also [formula] admit a flat holomorphic affine connection. As M is simply connected, the vector bundle [formula] over M is holomorphically trivial.

As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=CY], let p be the canonical projection of [formula] onto TM. Let n be the complex dimension of M and choose [formula] global holomorphic sections of [formula] such that [formula] span TM at a chosen point in M. Then [formula] is a nontrivial holomorphic section of K- 1M, where KM is the canonical bundle of M. We get a contradiction in the case where K- 1M doesn't admit nontrivial holomorphic sections.

Consider now the case where KM is trivial. Then the section [formula] doesn't vanish on M. Consequently, [formula] trivialize TM. Wang's theorem [\cite=Wang] implies that M is a quotient of a nontrivial connected simply connected complex Lie group G1 by a discrete subgroup. Since M is simply connected, this discrete subgroup has to be trivial and M identifies with G1. But there is no nontrivial compact simply connected complex Lie group: a contradiction.

Remark that all over the proof we didn't use the product structure of the manifold W = M  ×  N, but only the existence of a holomorphic vector bundle morphism from TW|M onto TM.
