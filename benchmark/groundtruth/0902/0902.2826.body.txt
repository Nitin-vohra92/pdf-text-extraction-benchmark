Coherent Manipulation of a 40Ca+ Spin Qubit in a Micro Ion Trap

Introduction

Our research is aimed at the realization of scalable quantum simulation and information processing  [\cite=CHUANG] [\cite=ROADMAPS]. Quantum computing with cold ions [\cite=ROOS1999] [\cite=ROOSPHD] [\cite=SCHMIDT2003] [\cite=SEIDELIN2006] has currently reached an experimental limit of scalability with up to eight ions if a conventional macroscopic trap is used [\cite=HAEFFNER2005]. This purely technical limitation is believed to be lifted using a segmented linear micro Paul trap, where only small groups of ions are to be kept in the quantum processing unit and multiple trap sites are used for the storage of large-scale entanglement  [\cite=KIELPINSKI2002]. Several different options for encoding a qubit with a trapped ion are possible and have been realized in various groups. One might either employ superpositions of a long lived electronic metastable state and the ground state, or alternatively use coherent superpositions of hyperfine or Zeeman ground states. In this paper we focus on 40Ca+ ions in a micro trap and qubits which are encoded in Zeeman sublevels of the S1 / 2 ground state. We will discuss in detail how these qubits are initialized, coherently manipulated and how finally the quantum information is read out with high fidelity. With the ion cooled close to its vibrational ground state we are well set for two-qubit quantum logic gate operations in a multi-segmented linear micro trap; a scalable approach to ion quantum processing.

The paper is organized as follows: First, we give a brief overview on the experimental apparatus used including the micro trap and the various laser sources. In Sect. [\ref=qubitvariations] we discuss the advantages of our choice of Zeeman ground state superpositions for the qubit encoding. Two basic steps for qubit utilization, namely state preparation and read-out are demonstrated in Sect. [\ref=qubitprepredout]. Finally, we explain in detail how Raman transitions for the spin qubit manipulations are characterized (Sect. [\ref=secraman]) and present results for sideband cooling and coherent qubit dynamics (Sect. [\ref=sidebandcooling]). We show how phonon number distributions can be extracted from the analysis of Rabi oscillations on the blue sideband of the Raman transition and investigate the dynamics of the phonon distribution in the micro trap. The outlook sketches the future perspectives of our experiment for multi qubit quantum logic.

Experimental Apparatus

Segmented Micro Ion Trap

We use a segmented linear micro ion trap. It is a sandwich structure of three alumina wafers, of which the top and bottom ones are gold coated and the middle one acts as a spacer. The trap structure is created by laser cutting with μm-scale resolution. Each trap layer consists of a RF electrode providing ponderomotive confinement in the radial plane and a set of DC electrodes for confinement in the axial direction. The RF electrodes extend along the whole length of the trap and have notches at the positions of the gaps between neighboring DC segments in order to suppress axial bumps in the RF field. They are supplied by up to [formula] at 24.8 ~ . The DC electrodes are supplied with voltages in [formula] range by a computer-controlled battery-powered supply which is designed to provide fast and accurate voltage waveforms to the electrodes at low noise and output impedance. The ionic motion exhibits one vibrational mode along the trap axis which is to be used as the 'bus' mode for entangling operations. Under typical trapping conditions, when a voltage of -6 V is applied to one pair of dc segments and all other dc electrodes are grounded, an axial frequency of ωax / 2π  =  1.35 ~  is measured. The radial confinement leads to two nondegenerate radial modes with typical frequencies of ωx,yrad / 2π  =  {2.0,3.5}  ~  . For further details we refer to the description in [\cite=SCHULZ2006] [\cite=SCHULZ2008].

Laser Sources and Ion Detection

A single ion is loaded by photoionization of a weak neutral calcium beam by resonant two-photon photoionization [\cite=GULDE2001]. Doppler cooling is achieved by means of a grating-stabilized diode laser at 397 ~ , slightly red detuned with respect to the S1 / 2 to P1 / 2 dipole transition, see Fig.[\ref=levelscheme](a). As the cooling cycle is not closed, a grating-stabilized diode laser at 866 ~  is used for repumping from the metastable D3 / 2 state. The light from both sources is switched by means of acousto-optical modulators (AOM). For Doppler cooling we irradiate 100μW and 500μW near 397 nm and 866 nm, respectively. The waist size of both beams is about 30μm at the ion's location. When necessary, population in the D5 / 2 state (1.2 ~  lifetime) can be pumped to the P3 / 2 by a grating stabilized laser diode near 854 nm, followed by a fast decay to the S1 / 2 ground state, which is referred to as quenching. Since the long lifetime of the D5 / 2 state is important for qubit measurement, no quench light must be present during readout. To ensure sufficient extinction of the quench laser, the light of about 10 ~ μ in a beam waist of about 50 ~ μ is switched by a double-pass AOM. All diode lasers are locked to Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) errors signals from stable Fabry-P�rot cavities which are tuned by a piezo driven mirror.

In order to drive the S1 / 2 to D5 / 2 quadrupole transition we use an amplified diode laser system. This laser source near 729 nm is PDH locked to an ultra-low expansion cavity in a UHV-vessel. We estimate the laser linewidth to be better than 5 kHz as determined from Ramsey contrast measurements on the quadrupole transition, where coherence decay times of up to 200 ~ μ were observed. The laser light near 729 nm is switched and modulated by a double-pass AOM controlled by a versatile function generator (VFG), a DDS/FPGA based RF-source [\cite=WUNDERLICH2007]. This allows for generation of laser pulses with almost arbitrary frequency, phase and amplitude profiles. The resulting laser beam has a power of up to 140 ~  and is focused down to roughly 10 ~ μ, allowing Rabi frequencies up to 1.5 ~  on the S1 / 2, mJ =  + 1 / 2 to D5 / 2, mJ =  + 5 / 2 transition. The polarization is chosen to be at an angle of 45[formula] to the quantizing magnetic field, whereas the propagation direction is orthogonal to it. This way, all allowed transitions between the Zeemann sublevels of the S1 / 2 and D5 / 2 states become accessible [\cite=ROOSPHD] (Fig. [\ref=levelscheme]). The beam enters at an angle of 45[formula] with respect to the trap axis, allowing for momentum transfer to the axial and the radial modes. We calculate the coupling to the ion's motion (Lamb-Dicke factors) of ηax  =  0.06 and ηx,yrad  =  {0.034,0.026}.

Raman transitions between the spin levels mJ = +1/2 and -1/2 of the S1 / 2 ground state are driven by two laser beams close to the strong S1 / 2 to P1 / 2 dipole transition. The beams are derived from a frequency doubled amplified laser diode system delivering up to 120 ~  of power at 397 ~ . The laser is divided into three different beams which are termed R1, R2 and CC. The Raman transitions are then driven either by the pair R1/R2 or the pair R1/CC, see Fig. [\ref=levelscheme](b). All Raman beams are switched and modulated by single-pass AOMs. The AOMs for R2 and CC are supplied by the same VFG source as the AOM for the 729 ~  laser. The AOM for R1 is supplied by an RF synthesizer, which also serves as a phase reference for the VFG, therefore the necessary phase stability between R1/CC and R1/R2 is guaranteed. The limit of accuracy for the relative frequency between VFG and synthesizer was measured to be 10 ~ , which has no adverse effect, because the timescale on which a single measurement cycle is carried out is much shorter (up to 20 ~ ).

The 397 nm fluorescence light emitted by the ion during Doppler cooling is detected by an electron multiplier CCD camera and a photomultiplier tube. With typical fluorescence rates of 50 counts in 3 ms from a single ion with a background of about 5 counts from scattered light, we can discriminate the state with a statistical error in the sub-per mil range [\cite=ROOSPHD].

All laser sources are controlled by a versatile computer control program and continuously monitored by a wavemeter with 5 MHz accuracy. A typical experimental sequence consists of four steps: (a) The ion is Doppler cooled for 3 ms, (b) then it is cooled close to the ground state of the axial vibrational mode by resolved sideband cooling (Sect. [\ref=sidebandcooling]). (c) The qubit is then initialized (Sect. [\ref=subsecpumping]) and (d) coherent manipulations are performed on the Raman transition (Sect. [\ref=sec:Raman1]). Finally, (e) the population in the mJ = +1/2 qubit level is shelved (Sect. [\ref=subsecreadout]) to the D5 / 2 level and (f) the state is read out by counting 397 nm laser induced fluorescence for 3 ms. After quenching the state by light near 854 nm the cycle (a) to (f) is repeated, typically for 100 times, giving the average transfer probability on the qubit transition.

Qubit Realizations with Ca+ Ions and Arguments for a Ground State Spin Qubit

The level scheme of Ca+ ions allows for at least three options to encode qubit information in a long lived superposition of two electronic quantum states. The optical qubit is encoded in a superposition of the ground state [formula] S1 / 2 and the metastable [formula] D5 / 2. Coherent manipulations are driven directly on this quadrupole transition by laser pulses near 729 nm, an approach has been realized with great success by the Innsbruck group [\cite=MONZ2009] [\cite=KIRCHMAIR2009]. Disadvantages to this approach are limitations to the coherence due to phase stability of the laser source at 729 nm and ambient magnetic field fluctuations, as well as the relatively small Lamb-Dicke factor which leads to a rather weak momentum kick of the laser excitation on the ion vibrational motion, affecting the two qubit gate speed. The optical qubit is read out efficiently and simply by state dependent fluorescence, as the ground state scatters photons while the D5 / 2 remains dark.

Another option is to use 43Ca+ with nuclear spin I=7/2 and to encode the qubit in hyperfine ground state levels |F = 4,mF = 0〉 and |F = 3,mF = 0〉. Coherent manipulations are achieved by employing a Raman transition, which means that an ultra-stable laser source is no longer required. It is straightforward to achieve excellent relative phase stability if the two Raman beams are derived from a single laser source. However, the large frequency gap of about 3.4 GHz must be bridged with high-bandwidth AOMs. Hyperfine clock states, insensitive to the linear Zeeman effect, can be used as computational basis states [\cite=BENHELM2008], which greatly increases the qubit phase coherence. The qubit readout is based on state dependent fluorescence.

For the measurements presented here we have chosen the option to encode the qubit in spin sublevels [formula] and [formula] of the ion's electronic ground state S1 / 2 mJ = ±   1/2 of 40Ca+ with I=0, Zeeman split by an applied magnetic field. Coherent manipulations are achieved by employing a Raman transition and the requirement of an ultra-stable laser source can then be dropped as in the case of hyperfine qubits, but the much smaller frequency splitting of about 20 MHz allows the use of simple and efficient AOMs. The high Lamb-Dicke factor of UV-Raman transitions ensures fast two qubit gate operations. As compared to ion species with hyperfine structure we work with a much simpler level structure reducing the experimental complications. Qubit readout, however, is more complicated since both the [formula] and [formula] states can scatter photons near 397 nm. In order to discriminate between the two qubit states, the population in [formula] must first be completely transferred to the metastable D5 / 2 state. A future possibility to avoid qubit dephasing due to its magnetic field sensitivity for the 40Ca+ spins will be using two physical qubits (ions), in a decoherence free subspace of Bell states to encode one logical qubit [\cite=DFSQUBIT] [\cite=HAEFFNER20052], in the spirit of designer atoms [\cite=ROOS2006].

Qubit Preparation and Readout

According to the DiVincenzo criteria [\cite=DIVICENZO2000], the initialization of qubits to a well defined state and the read-out of the full quantum state of the qubits are essential criteria for the realization of quantum information experiments. In our experiment, both steps are realized by using a narrow optical quadrupole transition at 729 ~ , and both are optimized to achieve high fidelities even under the presence of experimental imperfections and noise.

State Preparation via Optical Pumping

The common technique for preparing an initial quantum state via optical pumping employs a circularly polarized laser beam resonant with the S1 / 2 to P1 / 2 dipole transition at 397 ~ . In this case, both double-refraction by the vacuum windows and a small offset angle between the propagation direction [formula] and the quantizing magnetic field results in spurious polarization components. The improper polarization components deteriorate the initialization fidelity. Furthermore, as the target state is not completely dark anymore, this leads to a continuous photon scattering of Doppler cooling light, which counteracts the ground state sideband cooling (Sect. [\ref=sidebandcooling]). Therefore, we use the high spectral selectivity of the narrow quadrupole transition for optical pumping [\cite=ROOS2006]. If the ion is to be initialized in the [formula] level, the population from [formula] is transferred to the D5 / 2, mJ =  + 3 / 2 level by a pulse at 729 ~  and transferred back to the ground state by the quench laser via the P3 / 2 state. This cycle is repeated until the desired initialization is reached with high fidelity.

We compare two different schemes for this pumping: Either we use a pulsed scheme or we switch on both light fields continuously on (Fig. [\ref=pumping]). In the pulsed scheme, after about a π pulse on the quadrupole transition the quench beam at 854nm is briefly switched on. We find that a quench pulse of just 2~  μ is sufficient for complete quenching of the D5 / 2 state.

The 729 ~  π-pulse length of about 10 ~ μ determines the amount of off-resonant excitation and thus the fidelity of the scheme: The target transition [formula] to D5 / 2, mJ =  + 5 / 2 is separated from the parasitic transition [formula] to D5 / 2, mJ =  + 3 / 2 by ~  8 ~  for a magnetic field of 6.7 G. The frequency component of the Fourier transform of the effective square pulses (without any pulse shaping) already results in an expected pumping fidelity better than 99.6%, in agreement with the value for the combined pumping and readout fidelity (see below) in the experiment of 99.6% {Fig. [\ref=pumping]a). The cw scheme suffers from the fact that the presence of the quench beam hinders the coherent buildup of population in the D5 / 2 state

Spin readout

A simple readout of the spin state by fluorescence observation is impossible because the Zeeman splitting of the spin level [formula] and [formula] is smaller than the natural linewidth Γ / 2π  ≈  22 ~  of the corresponding dipole 397 nm transition. A scheme circumventing this by means of electromagnetically induced transparency has been proposed and experimentally realized [\cite=MCDONNELL2004], reaching a fidelity of 86%.

Our scheme reaches 99.6% fidelity and additionally shows a high robustness against imperfect laser settings or noise in the control parameters, still with a remarkably modest experimental effort. In a first step we apply a rapid adiabatic passage pulse (RAP) [\cite=WUNDERLICH2007] where the amplitude is adiabatically switched on and off and the frequency is chirped across resonance. Even for an ion after Doppler cooling, a single RAP pulse on the [formula] to D5 / 2, mJ =  + 5 / 2 transition yields a fidelity of 95%, the leftover population in the [formula] is then transferred by a second RAP to the D5 / 2, mJ =  + 3 / 2 state and we reach a 99.6% readout fidelity with a high resilience against drift of 729 nm laser frequency, see Fig. [\ref=readout].

Raman Transitions between the Spin Qubit Levels

Raman Spectroscopy and Characterization of the Transition

In our experiment we use Raman beams derived from one laser source (see Sect. [\ref=expapp]). The laser is detuned from the S1 / 2  →  P1 / 2 resonance frequency by Δ, referred to as the Raman detuning. It is up to several tens of GHz and can be chosen to be both positive (blue detuning) or negative (red detuning). As Δ is very large compared the Zeeman splittings within the S1 / 2 and P1 / 2 manifolds, which is on the order of 10 to 20 MHz, it can be considered constant for the different transitions between the Zeeman levels. The P1 / 2 state can be adiabatically eliminated from the dynamics, giving an effective two-level system. The Raman Rabi frequency now reads [formula], where Ωi are the resonant single dipole Rabi frequencies associated with the individual beams.

A great advantage of the utilization of Raman transitions for quantum logic is the better control over the Lamb-Dicke factor. The difference k-vector of the beams strongly depends on the chosen geometry, see Fig. [\ref=levelscheme](a). In our setup, two different beam geometries are employed. In the first of these, a pair of Raman beams, R1 and CC, propagate parallel to each other and orthogonal to the magnetic field. The difference k-vector of the two beams is effectively zero, so the Lamb-Dicke factor is extremely small and electronic excitation is insensitive to the ion's motion. One of the beams (referred to as 'R1') is π-polarized, driving the ΔmJ = 0 transition. The other beam (referred to as 'CC', cocarrier) is polarized orthogonal to the magnetic field. It therefore yields two circular components, one of which contributes to the coherent dynamics of the effective two-level system if the Raman resonance condition is fulfilled, i.e. if the relative detuning of the beams matches the Zeeman splitting between the qubit levels. The alternative geometry consists of R1 and a beam propagating along the magnetic field direction (referred to as 'R2') such that the k-vector of the beat pattern is aligned along the trap axis. With no component of the k-vector in the radial plane of the trap, this Raman light field interacts only with the axial vibrational mode, and avoids any phonon induced dephasing from the radial modes commonly called spectator modes. This fact is of tremendous importance for our microtrap with prospects to many ions, as we can drop the requirement of ground state cooling of all vibrational modes which would be experimentally undesirable.

From the beam geometry and the axial vibrational frequency we deduce a Lamb-Dicke factor of η  =  0.21, which is much larger than for the optical transition.

A Raman spectrum is shown in Fig. [\ref=spectrum], clearly displaying the axial sidebands of motion for a single ion after Doppler cooling with n̄  ~   15 quanta and an axial trap frequency of 1.35 MHz.

Raman Rabi Oscillations on the Carrier Transition

Rabi oscillations driven by the R1/CC beams pair are shown in Fig. [\ref=ccrabi]. Here, with η  =  0, no phonon-induced dephasing can occur. For the experiment, we follow the sequence in Sect. [\ref=expapp] without ground state cooling in step (b) and apply in step (c) both beams R1 and CC simultaneously for an interaction time t. The experiment is repeated 100 times and the average excitation probability is plotted.

Showing no influence of the phonon number distribution, this technique provides an excellent opportunity for studying other sources of decoherence. These are ambient magnetic field fluctuations, fluctuations of the relative phases of the beams due to air currents or mechanical vibrations, laser intensity fluctuations and spontaneous photon scattering. The latter two mechanisms scale with the total effective pulse area imparted to the ion on each of the dipole transitions pertaining to the Raman transition. Because of this, a Ramsey contrast measurement on a spin superposition created by R1/CC with fixed pulse areas and variable delay between the Ramsey pulses allows us to study the limits imposed by magnetic field noise and interferometric stability. Such a measurement has given a contrast of 90% after a delay time of 1.5 ms. As π-times of down to 2 ~ μ are routinely achieved, this separation of time scales appears sufficient for quantum logic experiments. We find in our setup that an air shield and the high passive mechanical interferometer stability of the optical setup are sufficient to avoid technically induced dephasing. The fundamental physical coherence limit of qubits is given by spontaneous photon scattering  [\cite=OZERI2005] [\cite=OZERI2007] .

During operations with the Raman beams, the small amount of population off-resonantly excited to the P1 / 2 state decays with a rate corresponding to the inverse lifetime of this state, which results in random repopulation of the qubit levels. This off-resonant excitation reads for each beam i as pP1 / 2  =  Ω2i / 2Δ2, decreasing with the ratio of Rabi frequency and Raman detuning. Similar to far detuned optical dipole traps [\cite=RUDI], the photon scattering rate can be reduced if a large Δ is chosen at a high laser intensity. We investigated the photon scattering experimentally: For a given Raman detuning and fixed beam powers, the Rabi frequency is measured from Rabi oscillations as in Fig. [\ref=ccrabi] along with the scattering rates caused by each of the Raman beams individually. For this, the ion is initialized in [formula] and one of the Raman beams is blocked. We apply the remaining Raman beam with a pulse of variable length. Finally, from the population in [formula] we infer the scattering rate of beam i.

For the analysis, we normalize the measured Rabi frequency by the geometric mean of both scattering rates, such that in the resulting quantity, the individual Raman beam dipole coupling strenghts Ωi are canceled.

A value of [formula] is expected when the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the transitions are taken into account. The result is shown in Fig. [\ref=scatter], where the vertical axis can be interpreted as the number of Rabi cycles that could be driven on average before a single spontaneous scattering event occurs, in the absence of any other decoherence sources. The results for the R1/CC pair match very well the theoretical expectation. The fact that the values for the R1/CC pair match the theoretical expectation was initially not taken for granted because of the type of laser source used: A tapered amplifier generates a background of amplified spontaneous emission whose width in the range of a few nm is given by the gain profile of the semiconductor laser medium. Through sum frequency generation, it is in principle possible that photons at frequencies ω0 + n  ωFSR are generated in the doubling stage, where ω0 is the laser mode frequency and ωFSR is the free spectral range of the doubling stage. If such a frequency matches the direct optical S1 / 2 to P1 / 2 transition, resonant photon scattering would occur.

The same experiment, but with the R1/R2 pair of Raman beams, yields lower values for the Raman Rabi frequency. As in this geometry the excitation is sensitive to the motional degree of freedom along the trap axis, we attribute the lower value to the decrease of the Raman Rabi frequency with increasing phonon number and axial micromotion components at the trap drive frequency of 24.8 ~ .

Another characterization of the Raman interaction is done by the determination of the AC-Stark shifts, given by ΔS  =  Ω2i / 4Δ for one beam i. The absolute AC Stark shift might be different for the two qubit levels [formula] and [formula], leading to a differential shift. Under these circumstances, the quantum phase of qubit superpositions, or of multi-ion entangled states evolves not only according to the desired gate operations, but shows an additional intensity dependent rapid phase evolution. If this is the case, intensity fluctuations of the Raman lasers lead to qubit phase fluctuations, which represents an additional strong decoherence source.

The absolute AC-Stark shifts for all beams and qubit states is measured with the following procedure: First, the qubit is prepared either in the [formula] or the [formula] level by optical pumping with circularly polarized 397 nm laser light. Then, a superposition on the quadrupole transition is created by means of a π / 2 pulse with the 729 nm laser, either with the D5 / 2,mJ =  + 5 / 2 level for the [formula] state or D5 / 2,mJ =  + 3 / 2 level for [formula]. A second π / 2 pulse after a delay time of 50 ~ μ concludes the Ramsey sequence. During this delay, a phase shift pulse from one of the Raman beams is irradiated on the ion, leading to a Ramsey fringe signal as the duration of the shift pulse is scanned. The absolute shift is then calculated from the fringe period tR according to ΔS = 2π / tR. For the R1 beam the [formula] level is shifted by 2π  ·  0.32(2)MHz, and the [formula] level is shifted by 2π  ·  0.33(2)MHz. Within the experimental errors, the differential shift from R1 vanishes. In contrast, we measured shifts from the R2 beam with 2π  ·  0.17(2)MHz for the [formula] level and 2π  ·  0.29(2)MHz for the [formula] level, resulting in a differential shift of about 2π  ·  120 kHz. Compensation of the differential shift is possible by proper adjustment of the polarization of the corresponding beam.

Resolved Sideband Cooling and Blue Sideband Rabi Oscillations

Cooling close to the ground state of at least one vibrational mode is an essential prerequisite for two-ions gates, as even gate schemes for 'hot' ions require operation in the Lamb-Dicke regime η  sqrtn  ≪  1 [\cite=LEIBFRIED2002]. For cooling close to the ground state one has to resort to a narrow transition with resolved motional sidebands [\cite=MARZOLI], such that transitions to states with one less phonon (red sideband, RSB) can be driven preferentially and the n = 0 state acts as a dark state in which the population is finally trapped. In our system, we have two options to spectroscopically resolve sidebands, either the R1/R2 Raman transition or the quadrupole transition.

As the cooling always competes with the heating rate from trap induced electric field noise, a high cooling rate is essential for a good cooling result. A priori, the Raman transition seems to be better suited for cooling because the higher ratio of RSB to carrier Rabi frequency, which is essentially given by η on the decisive 'bottleneck' step from n = 1 to n = 0. This is because ideally, the cooling rate is limited by off-resonant excitation of the carrier transition with subsequent spontaneous decay which can lead to the creation of one phonon. However, the problem arises in the dissipative step of cooling where the ion is repumped to the initial state to restart the red sideband excitation. In the case of the Raman cooling scheme, the repumping is accomplished by the circular 397 ~  beam which suffers from the spurious polarization error discussed in Sect. [\ref=optpump]. Therefore the dark state n = 0 is not completely dark anymore, leading to a competing Doppler re-heating process which limits the attainable temperature.

In contrast, the sideband cooling on the [formula] to D5 / 2,mJ =  + 5 / 2 quadrupole transition does not suffer from this because the repumping is achieved by the quench laser near 854 nm, which does not interact with the ion anymore once one photon is spontaneously scattered. The cooling cycle is almost closed, because the decay from the P3 / 2 state during the quench leads preferentially to the [formula] level due to the selection rules. Only unlikely decay events into one of the D-states can lead to population of the [formula] level. We utilize a pulsed sideband cooling scheme, since as for the qubit initialization, the power and frequency of the quench laser are no longer critical parameters then. The cooling pulse time is set such that an excitation maximum is reached on the RSB. This time ranges typically between 10 ~ μ and 20 ~ μ, and increases as lower phonon numbers are reached because the RSB Rabi frequency scales as [formula] with the phonon number n. After the RSB pulse, a quench pulse of typically 2 ~ μ completes the cooling cycle. After ten cooling cycles, about 10% of the population is accumulated in the wrong ground state spin level, such that a 397 ~  repump pulse has to be employed. After eight such sequences, we employ a second cooling stage where the RSB pulse duration is increased and the 729 ~  optical pumping procedure is used instead of the circular 397 ~  pulses. The longer time for repumping has no adverse effect on the cooling rate because it is used only every ten cycles.

Determination of the Phonon Number Distribution

We confirm the sideband cooling result by employing either the quadrupole transition or the R1/R2 Raman transition. The optimization of the cooling is performed by minimizing the peak excitation of the RSB of the quadrupole transition, which is essentially given by the probability of not finding the ion in the ground state. For more accurate determination of the phonon number distribution we employ Raman Rabi oscillations on the R1/R2 BSB, with the advantage that no contributions from the radial vibrational modes can influence the result, and on the other hand the larger Lamb-Dicke factor of the Raman transition leads to a better separation of the Rabi frequencies for the various n  →  n + 1 transitions. Excitation data are acquired until the oscillation contrast of the excitation signal has decreased beyond the projection noise limit for long pulse widths, see Fig. [\ref=coolstuff]. The recorded traces are analyzed by cosine transform to obtain the frequency components for the different contributing transitions, in full analogy to experiments on the cavity QED realization of the Jaynes-Cummings model [\cite=BRUNE1996] .

A resulting spectrum is shown in Fig. [\ref=fftbsb]. Upon proper normalization, the peak heights directly correspond to the occupation probabilities for the different phonon numbers. This data can then be used to reconstruct the coherent dynamics, allowing for the empirical inclusion of a coherence decay time [\cite=MEEKHOF1996]. This is done according to

[formula]

where [formula] is the probability for finding the ion in [formula], Pn is the phonon number distribution, Ωn,n + 1 is the Rabi frequency pertaining the specific BSB transition, A is the read-out contrast of 96% and γ is the coherence decay rate. The coherence time 1 / γ is found to be 280(20) ~  μ. As Ramsey contrast measurements on the R1/CC transition yielded a much longer coherence time, the additional decoherence either stems from pulse area fluctuations or a reduced interferometric stability in the R1/R2 beam setup with respect to the R1/CC geometry. The phonon distribution is reconstructed for various waiting times after sideband cooling in order to reveal the trap induced heating dynamics. The time dependent phonon number distribution is shown in Fig. [\ref=phonons], along with the resulting mean phonon number. This directly gives the heating rate to be 0.3(1) phonons/ms.

The corresponding Rabi oscillations on the carrier of the R1/R2 Raman transition are shown in Fig. [\ref=coolstuff2]. Taking the phonon number after sideband cooling from the BSB Rabi oscillations, we find excellent agreement with the measurements made on the carrier transition.

Outlook

In the future, the full control of a single spin qubit demonstrated here will be extended to two ion crystals. Then, a two-qubit quantum gate utilizing spin dependent light forces will be used for the deterministic generation of Bell states. Taking advantage of the multi-segmented micro ion trap we intend to split the entangled two-ion crystal and investigate the separation of entangled states over distances of a few mm. As the lifetime of entangled Bell states in the decoherence-free basis states is long [\cite=HAEFFNER20052], measured to be a few seconds in experiments using the Zeeman sublevels of 40Ca+, we expect to be able to generate many of these Bell states within their coherence time. Protocols such as entanglement purification [\cite=JWPAN2003], entanglement swapping [\cite=RIEBE2008], the generation of cluster states [\cite=BRIEGEL2001] will then be possible.
