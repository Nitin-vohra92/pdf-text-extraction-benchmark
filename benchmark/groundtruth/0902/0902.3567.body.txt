Lifting Frenet Formulas

1. Introduction

Let a unit speed curve β0(t) with constant κ > 0 on space [formula], and suppose that T,N,B be respectively tangent, normal, binormal vector on any point of β0(t). Then, we will call that the triple {T,N,B} is Frenet frame such that T.N = B.T = B.N = 0. In differentiable geometry, lift method plays an important role. Because, it is possible to generalize to differentiable structures on any space (resp. manifold) to extended spaces (resp. extended manifolds) using lift function [\cite=yano] [\cite=tekkoyun1] [\cite=tekkoyun2]. So, it may be extended the following theorem given on space [formula] to its tangent space [formula].

Theorem 1.1(The Frenet Formulas)[\cite=opera]. For a unit speed curve β0(t) with constant κ > 0 on [formula], the derivatives of Frenet frame {T,N,B} are given by

[formula]

where T,N,B,κ,τ0 is respectively tangent vector, normal vector, binormal vector, curvature, torsion of the curve β0(t).

The paper is structured as follows. In second 2, the vertical, complete and horizontal lifts of a vector field defined on any manifold M of dimension m and their lift properties will be extended to space [formula]. In second 3, vertical lift of the theorem above will be obtained. Then, similar to vertical lift, complete and horizontal lift analogues of the related theorem are given.

In this study, all geometric objects will be assumed to be of class C∞   and the sum is taken over repeated indices. Also, v,c, and H denote the vertical, complete and horizontal lifts of any differentiable geometric structures defined on [formula] to [formula] respectively.

2. Lift of Vector Field

The vertical lift of a vector field X on space [formula] to extended space [formula] is the vector field [formula] given as:

[formula]

The vector field [formula] defined by

[formula]

is called the complete lift of a vector field X on [formula] to its tangent space [formula].

The horizontal lift of a vector field X on a space [formula] to [formula] is the vector field [formula] determined by

[formula]

The general properties of vertical, complete and horizontal lifts of a vector field on [formula] are as follows:

Proposition 2.1: Let be functions all [formula]and vector fields all [formula]Then it is satisfied the following equalities.

[formula]

Where Γαβ are Christopher symbols, U and TU are respectively topological opens of [formula] and [formula] [formula] 1  ≤  α,β  ≤  3.

3. Lifting Frenet Formulas

In this section, we compute the vertical, complete and horizontal lifts of Frenet formulas given by means of T,N and B Frenet vectors on a unit speed curve β0(t) with constant κ > 0 defined on space [formula].

a) The vertical lifting Frenet Formulas

Let Tv be vertical lift of tangent vector T on a unit speed curve β0(t). Length of Tv is given as:

[formula]

With respect to the product rule, it follows

[formula]

Thus [formula] and [formula] is found orthonormal to Tv. Therefore it is said [formula] is normal to unit speed curve β1(t) = (β0(t))v. Similarly, we have

[formula]

In this case Tv,Nv and Bv are three orthonormal Frenet vectors on β1(t) in the 6-dimensional space [formula]

Theorem 3.1: For a unit speed curve β1(t) with constant (κ)v > 0 on [formula], the derivatives's vertical lifts of the Frenet vectors are given as:

[formula]

Where (κ)v [formula] and [formula] are respectively curvature and torsion of the curve β1(t).

Proof: Let [formula] be vertical lifts of [formula], [formula] which are derivatives of T,N,B, respectively. We already know

[formula]

by definition of Nv, where the curvature (κ)vdescribes variation in direction of Tv. Also, we shall find [formula] and [formula] In particular, Given [formula] If it can be identified a1,b1,c1,Tv,Nv and Bv then it will be known [formula] Firstly, we have

[formula]

Similarly, [formula] and Bv.[formula] So, it follows

[formula]

Now let's identify [formula] We know Tv.Bv = (T.B)v = 0, so that [formula] by vertical lift properties and the product rule. Then, using Nv.Bv = (N.B)v = 0, it is found

[formula]

We can also identify [formula] We have Bv.Bv = (B.B)v = 1, so [formula] Thus, [formula] Define [formula] be the torsion of the curve β1(t). From the above, [formula] is calculated as:

[formula]

Now it will be obtained [formula] Just as for [formula] it follows

[formula]

The same types of calculations give (T.N)v = Tv.Nv = 0, therefore [formula] and [formula] so it is obtained [formula] Also, Nv.Nv = 1, so [formula] and Bv.Nv = 0, in this case [formula] Thus, by definition it is found to be [formula]. Hence, [formula] is computed to be

[formula]

Therefore, proof finishes.[formula]

b) The complete and horizontal lifting Frenet formulas

One may easily show that it is the complete and horizontal lift analogues of Frenet formulas the following as:

Theorem 3.2: For a unit speed curve β2(t) = (β0(t))c with constant (κ)c > 0 on tangent space [formula], complete lifts of the derivatives of the Frenet frame are given by equations

[formula]

where (κ)c [formula]and [formula] are curvature and torsion of the curve β2(t), respectively.

Theorem 3.3: For a unit speed curve β3(t) = (β0(t))H with (κ)H > 0 on the tangent space [formula], the expression's horizontal lifts of derivatives of the Frenet frame are equalized expressions

[formula]

where the curvature and torsion of the curve β3(t)    are respectively given by (κ)H [formula]and [formula] .

Conclusion

In this study, using lifting methods, we see that it may be generalized the derivatives of Frenet frame elements given a unit speed curve on space [formula] to its extension [formula]
