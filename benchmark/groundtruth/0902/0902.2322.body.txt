Bounding the regularity of subschemes invariant under Pfaff fields on projective spaces

Introduction

In 1891, Poincaré [\cite=Po], p. 161, posed the problem of bounding a priori the degree of the first integral of a polynomial vector field on the complex plane, when the integral is algebraic. The importance of such a bound is that it allows us to decide whether the integral is algebraic or not by making purely algebraic computations.

Poincaré himself produced bounds in special cases. But no bounds have been found in general. Actually, many obstructions to finding such bounds have been discovered: For instance, Lins Neto [\cite=L] produced examples to show that a bound cannot depend only on the degree m of the vector field and on the analytic type of its singularities in the plane or at infinity.

The current interest in Poincaré's problem was revived exactly a hundred years later by Lins Neto and Cerveau [\cite=CeL], who showed that an algebraic curve invariant under the vector field has degree at most m + 2, if the singularities of the curve are ordinary double points, the bound achieved only if the curve is reducible; see loc. cit., Thm. 1, p. 891. Since then many papers have concentrated on this related problem, of bounding the degrees of algebraic curves invariant under the vector field. This has often been called the Poincaré problem. Works on this problem, allowing for more singular curves, are [\cite=CamCar], [\cite=Car], [\cite=EsK3], [\cite=dPW] and [\cite=Pe], to cite a few.

The problem has also been considered for higher dimensional spaces. One of the first to do so was Soares [\cite=S]. In today's language, and in great generality, let [formula] denote the n-dimensional projective space over an algebraically closed field k, and consider a Pfaff field, a map [formula] from the sheaf of s-forms [formula], for an integer s between 1 and n - 1 called the rank of η, to an invertible sheaf L. The unique numerical global invariant under deformations of η besides its rank is m: =  deg (L) + s, the degree of η. The singular locus of η is its degeneracy scheme S, supported on the set of points where η is not surjective. A closed subscheme [formula] is said to be invariant under η if η induces a Pfaff field ΩsX  →  L|X on X. The above terminology is taken from [\cite=EsK2], Section 3.

The Pfaff field η may arise from a Pfaff system, as defined by Jouanolou [\cite=J], pp. 136-138, which is essentially a "singular distribution," in particular giving rise to an actual distribution on [formula]. Then subschemes of pure dimension s that are invariant under η are solutions of the corresponding Pfaff systems; see [\cite=EsK2], Prop. 3.2, p. 3782 for a precise statement.

If s = 1 then η is the homogenization of a polynomial vector field on [formula]. If s = n - 1, through the perfect pairing [formula], we may view η as the homogenization of a polynomial differential 1-form on [formula]. In both cases, η arises from a distribution away from S.

Some of the statements in the literature, and all of the statements in the present article, work in positive characteristic, under suitable assumptions. However, to simplify the ongoing discussion, assume that k has characteristic zero.

For s = n - 1 one may search for bounds on the degrees of hypersurfaces invariant under η. For instance, under the harmless assumption that dim (S)  ≤  n - 2, Brunella and Mendes [\cite=BMe] showed that an invariant reduced hypersurface with at most normal-crossings singularities has degree at most m + 2, generalizing the theorem by Cerveau and Lins Neto mentioned above; see loc. cit., p. 594 for a more general statement.

For s = 1 many inequalities have been produced for the degree and the genus of (reduced, equidimensional) curves invariant under η, for instance in [\cite=CamCarG] and [\cite=EsK1]. However, in the spirit of Poincaré's original problem, one should look for bounds on global invariants that could reduce to purely algebraic computations the question of whether η has an invariant curve or not. The (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity is such an invariant, as it is well-known that a subscheme [formula] is cut out by hypersurfaces with degree at most its regularity, [formula].

In [\cite=Es] the second author shows that an invariant arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (a.C.M.) curve C, with at most ordinary double points for singularities, such that [formula] is finite has regularity at most m + 2, with equality only if the curve is reducible; see loc. cit., Thm. 1, p. 3. Since complete intersections are a.C.M., and since the regularity of a hypersurface is its degree, the statement is another generalization of Cerveau's and Lins Neto's result.

Later, the second author and Kleiman showed that the inequality [formula] for an invariant a.C.M. curve (for s = 1) or invariant reduced hypersurface [formula] (for s = n - 1) with normal-crossings singularities was a consequence of the fact that hs(ΩsX(1)) = 0, and that the same holds for intermediate s. More precisely, for any s, an invariant, reduced, a.C.M. subscheme [formula] of pure dimension s whose irreducible components are not contained in S has regularity bounded by m + 2 if hs(ΩsX(1)) = 0, and bounded by m + 1 if hs(ΩsX) = 1; see [\cite=EsK2], Cor. 4.5, p. 3790 and Rmks. 4.6 and 4.7, p. 3791, from which the assertion can be extracted.

However, no further conditions for when h1(Ω1X) = 1 or h1(Ω1X(1)) = 0 are given in [\cite=EsK2]. These appear later in [\cite=EsK3], by the same authors, but only for n = 2. There a (reduced) plane curve C of degree d is considered, and it is shown that if the singular locus of C has regularity σ bounded by d - 2 then h1(Ω1C) = 1; and hence d  ≤  m + 1 if C is invariant. The highly singular case is handled as well, being shown that if C is invariant and ρ: = σ - d + 2 is positive, then d  ≤  m + 1 + ρ, with equality if d  ≥  2m + 2 and S is finite; see loc. cit., Thm. 2.5, p. 61.

In the present article, we extend the results of [\cite=EsK3] for n > 2 and any s. More precisely, our Theorem [\ref=h11] states that a connected, reduced subscheme [formula] of pure dimension s > 0 satisfies hs(ΩsX) = 1 if X is a.C.M. and subcanonical, for instance a complete intersection, and if its singular locus has regularity σ bounded by r - 2, where r is the regularity of X. From it follows Theorem [\ref=principal0], stating that r  ≤  m + 1 if in addition X is invariant and [formula]. Furthermore, by our Theorem [\ref=principal1], if X is simply a.C.M., and is invariant with [formula], then r  ≤  m + 1 + ρ, where ρ: =  max (1,σ - r + 2). Finally, Theorem [\ref=igualdade1] says that r = m + 1 + ρ if all the following conditions hold: s = 1 and S is finite; X is a.C.M., subcanonical and invariant; r  ≥  5 if m = 1 or r  ≥  mn - n + 4 if m > 1.

Since complete intersections are a.C.M., subcanonical subschemes, we obtain as a corollary that, if [formula] is a reduced complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degrees [formula], and is invariant under η with [formula], then

[formula]

where [formula], with σ denoting the regularity of the singular locus of X; see Corollary [\ref=regfolcur].

The techniques we use are quite simple: basically, a detailed analysis of the long exact sequences in cohomology of several short exact sequences of sheaves associated to the problem.

The pervasive hypothesis of arithmetic Cohen-Macaulayness is necessary, as the example of a sequence of smooth curves in [formula] of increasing regularity but invariant under degree-1 rank-1 Pfaff fields, presented in [\cite=Es], Rmk. 21, p. 14, shows. What is not clearly necessary is the hypothesis of subcanonicalness.

The possibility that r = m + 1 + ρ is investigated only for s = 1, because then S is easier to understand. Then, if S has dimension 0, which is the expected dimension and the case when η is general, the regularity of S is 1 if m = 1 and mn - n + 2 if m > 1; see Proposition [\ref=regsing] and the remark thereafter. This regularity gives the bound above which r must be for the equality r = m + 1 + ρ to hold. On the other hand, for s  ≥  2, those η having an invariant reduced subscheme of pure dimension s have large singular locus; indeed, dim (S)  ≥  s - 1 by [\cite=EsK2], Cor. 4.5, p. 3790. In particular, S does no have the expected dimension.

Section 2 collects a few results on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and on arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subschemes. In Section 3 we give conditions for when a subscheme [formula] of pure dimension s satisfies hs(ΩsX) = 1. In Section 4 we prove our bounds on the regularity of closed subschemes invariant under Pfaff fields. Finally, in Section 5 we prove that these bounds are attained, if the regularity is large enough, in the case of rank-1 Pfaff fields.

Arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay subschemes

Let [formula] be a closed subscheme. If dim (X) = 0 then [formula] is the smallest nonnegative integer r such that H1(IX(r - 1)) = 0, where IX is the sheaf of ideals of X.

Clearly, Hi(IX(m)) = 0 for every i > n and every [formula]. Thus the assertion follows from the definition of regularity if n = 1.

Suppose now that n > 1. We need only show that Hi(IX(r - i)) = 0 for each [formula] and each r  ≥  0. Let [formula]. Since X has dimension zero, Hi(OX(m)) = 0 for every i  ≥  1. On the other hand, from Serre computation, [formula] for each [formula]. Twisting the natural exact sequence

[formula]

by m, and taking cohomology, we get, for each [formula], the exact sequence

[formula]

If [formula] then [formula], and hence Hi(IX(m)) = 0. If i = n, since Hn - 1(OX(m)) = Hn(OX(m)) = 0 because n  ≥  2, we have

[formula]

But, from Serre computation, [formula] if m  ≥   - n. Thus Hn(IX(r - n)) = 0 for each r  ≥  0.

Let [formula] be a closed subscheme of pure dimension s > 0. If X is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay then [formula] is the smallest nonnegative integer r such that Hs(OX(r - s - 1)) = 0.

Suppose first that s = n, that is, [formula]. By definition, the regularity of [formula] is 1. On the other hand, by Serre computation, [formula] if and only if r  ≥  1. So, the proposition holds for s = n.

Now, assume s < n. Let IX denote the sheaf of ideals of X. Since X is a.C.M., Hi(IX(r - i)) = 0 for every [formula] and each [formula]. On the other hand, twisting the natural short exact sequence

[formula]

by r - i, and taking cohomology, we get the following exact sequence, for each integer i > 0:

[formula]

For [formula], since

[formula]

we have that Hi(IX(r - i)) = 0 for every [formula]. Also, since [formula] for r  ≥  0, and Hn - 1(OX(r - n)) = 0 if s < n - 1, it follows that Hn(IX(r - n)) = 0 for every r  ≥  0, if s < n - 1.

So, [formula] is the smallest nonnegative integer r such that Hs + 1(IX(r - s - 1)) = 0. But, if r  ≥  0 then

[formula]

because 0 < s < n, by Serre computation. So, by the exactness of ([\ref=sqi]) for i = s + 1,

[formula]

for every integer r  ≥  0.

Let [formula] be an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay a-subcanonical subscheme of pure dimension s > 0. Then a  ≥   - s - 1 and [formula].

Observe first that H0(OX(i)) = 0 if and only if i < 0. Indeed, since OX(1) is very ample, h0(OX(i)) > 0 for i  ≥  0. On the other hand, if there were a nonzero global section of OX(i) for a certain i < 0, multiplying it by - iH, for a sufficiently general hyperplane section H  ⊂  X, we would obtain a nonzero global section of OX vanishing at H, an absurd.

By duality, since OX(a) is the dualizing sheaf of X,

[formula]

So, Hs(OX(r - s - 1)) = 0 if and only if a - r + s + 1 < 0, that is, if and only if r  ≥  a + s + 2. It follows now from Proposition [\ref=reginter1] that [formula]. However, since [formula], we have that a + s + 2 > 0 and [formula].

The singular locus

The assertion follows from Serre computation if s = n. Assume s < n. Consider the injection

[formula]

Since X is reduced, both the source and target of this injection are of rank 1. So the injection is generically an isomorphism. Since the torsion subsheaf T(ΩsX) is supported in dimension at most s - 1, it follows that

[formula]

Since [formula] by Proposition [\ref=regsub], we must show that

[formula]

Set a: = r - s - 2. Let IΣX and IX be the sheaves of ideals of ΣX and X in [formula]. We claim that

[formula]

Indeed, twisting the natural exact sequence

[formula]

by a and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequence

[formula]

The first and last groups above are zero because s < n and r > 0, respectively. Thus

[formula]

But [formula]. So, by Serre Duality,

[formula]

where the last isomorphism follows from the connectedness of X.

Now, twisting the natural exact sequence

[formula]

by a, and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequence:

[formula]

Since X is a.C.M. of dimension s, the first group is zero. The last group is also zero. Indeed, twisting the natural exact sequence

[formula]

by a and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequence

[formula]

The first and last groups above are zero because dim (ΣX) < s and r > 0, respectively. Thus Hs + 1(IΣX(a)) = 0.

So the boundary map in ([\ref=midmap]) is surjective. Furthermore, since ([\ref=s+1a]) holds, we have that [formula] if and only if the boundary map is injective, which is the case if and only if Hs(IΣX(a)) = 0. But, if σ = 0 then [formula], and hence [formula]; then Hs(IΣX(a)) = 0 because s < n. And if r - 2  ≥  σ, then a  ≥  σ - s, and thus Hs(IΣX(a)) = 0.

Pfaff fields

By Theorem [\ref=h11], we have hs(ΩsX) = 1. So, by [\cite=EsK2], Cor. 4.5, p. 3790, since X is a.C.M., r  ≤  s +  deg (L) + 1, as claimed.

Let H be the cokernel of γX and G that of γY. It is enough to observe that G is a subsheaf of a quotient of H|Y. If Y = X the assertion is trivial. So assume Y  ≠  X. Let [formula], again with the reduced induced subscheme structure. From the way γX is defined, we see that γX decomposes as

[formula]

where the first map is induced by restriction of forms, and the last map, λ, is induced from the natural restriction map [formula]. Let T(ωX|Y) be the torsion subsheaf of ωX|Y, and denote by ωX,Y the quotient. Restricting ([\ref=compog]) to Y and removing torsion, we get the following composition:

[formula]

where β is the restriction map of s-forms, and ι is the composition of the canonical injection [formula] with λ and the quotient map ωX  →  ωX,Y. Since λ is generically an isomorphism and ωY is torsion-free, ι is injective. Since β is surjective and ι is injective, we get an injective map from G to

[formula]

which is a quotient of H|Y.

Set a: = r - s - 2. Let [formula] be any integer such that [formula]. Since ρ  ≥  1, we have [formula]. Let [formula] be a general hyperplane. Multiplication by [formula] induces an injection [formula]. Since Hs(OX(r - s - 1)) = 0 by Proposition [\ref=reginter1], and since the cokernel of the injection is supported in dimension at most s - 1, it follows that

[formula]

Let IX and IΣX be the sheaves of ideals of X and ΣX in [formula]. Twisting the natural short exact sequence

[formula]

by [formula] and taking cohomology we get the exact sequence

[formula]

Since [formula], the last group is zero by Serre computation, and thus, using ([\ref=H1Yrho]), we get

[formula]

On the other hand, since [formula] and a + ρ  ≥  σ - s, we have

[formula]

If Y is a union of irreducible components of X, with its reduced induced subscheme structure, then, since IX  ⊂  IY with quotient supported in dimension at most s, Equation [\eqref=H2Y0] implies that

[formula]

Similarly, since IΣX  ⊂  IΣY by Lemma [\ref=sigmaXY], and the quotient is supported in dimension at most s - 1, Equation [\eqref=H2SY0] implies

[formula]

Twisting the short exact sequence

[formula]

by [formula], and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequence

[formula]

Using ([\ref=H2YY]) and ([\ref=H2SYY0]) we get that

[formula]

Now, it follows from Proposition [\ref=reginter1] that Hs(OX(a))  ≠  0. Thus, by Serre Duality, there is a nonzero map τ:OX(a)  →  ωX. If X is subcanonical, this map is an isomorphism. At any rate, since both OX(a) and ωX are torsion-free, there is a union Y of irreducible components of X, with its reduced induced subscheme structure, such that τ factors though an injection OY(a)  →  ωX. This map factors through the natural map ωY  →  ωX, yielding an injection OY(a)  →  ωY. Of course, this injection induces one from IΣY,Y(a) to IΣY,YωY, which can be composed with the injection [formula], where

[formula]

with T(ΩsY) denoting the torsion subsheaf of ΩsY. Since IΣY,Y(a) and [formula] are rank-1, the cokernel of the composition [formula] is supported in dimension at most s - 1. Thus, it follows from [\eqref=SXX] that

[formula]

Notice that [formula]. Since X is invariant under η, so is Y. So there is a Pfaff field φ:ΩsY  →  OY(m - s) making the following diagram commute:

[formula]

where the vertical maps are the natural restrictions. The image of η is by definition [formula], where S is the singular locus of η. So, since the vertical maps are surjective, the image of φ is [formula].

Now, since [formula], the map φ is generically surjective, and hence, since Y is generically smooth, generically injective. In this case, the kernel of φ is the torsion subsheaf T(Ω1Y). So [formula], and hence [\eqref=SYY] implies that

[formula]

Twisting the natural exact sequence

[formula]

by [formula] and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequence:

[formula]

Since [formula], the last group is zero. So, it follows from ([\ref=H1ISY]) that

[formula]

However, since there is an injection OY(a)  →  ωY, we have that Hs(OY(a))  ≠  0. Since [\eqref=ellrho] holds for each [formula], we have a  ≤  m - s + ρ - 1, from which follows the stated inequality.

Let [formula] be a reduced complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degrees [formula] for a certain positive integer s. Let ΣX be the singular locus of X. Set [formula] and put

[formula]

Assume the characteristic of k is 0 or does not divide any of the di. Assume X is invariant under a Pfaff field [formula] of rank s. Set m: =  deg (L) + s. If [formula], where S is the singular locus of η, then

[formula]

Since X is a complete intersection, and of positive dimension, X is a.C.M. and connected. Also, the conormal sheaf C of X satisfies

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Hence, by Proposition [\ref=regsub],

[formula]

Apply Theorems [\ref=principal0] and [\ref=principal1] now.

Rank-1 Pfaff fields

Let [formula] be a rank-1 Pfaff field on [formula], for n  ≥  2. If m  ≥  1 and the singular locus S of η is finite then

[formula]

Let I§ be the sheaf of ideals of S and η': = η(1 - m). Then [formula] has image I§, or degeneration scheme S. Consider the Koszul complex of η':

[formula]

where d1: = η'. Since S is finite, S is of the expected codimension. Since [formula] is Cohen-Macaulay, the dual to η' is a regular section, and hence the complex above is exact at positive level.

Let [formula] for [formula]. Then I1  =  I§ and [formula]. Also, we can break ([\ref=1]) in the following short exact sequences:

[formula]

Twisting these sequences by r - 1, and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequences:

[formula]

for [formula], where [formula].

Set b: = nm - n + 2. Notice that, since m  ≥  1,

[formula]

So, if r  ≥  b - 1 then [formula] for [formula], with equality only if r = b - 1. In particular, [formula] for r  ≥  b - 1, with equality only if r = b - 1. So, from [\cite=D], Thm. 1.1, p. 40, it follows that [formula] for r  ≥  b, while [formula] for r  ≥  b - 1, for [formula]. Then, from the exact sequences ([\ref=exatas1]) we get surjections

[formula]

for r  ≥  b - 1, which are all isomorphisms for r  ≥  b. Now, [formula]. So, again by [\cite=D], Thm. 1.1, p. 40, we have that hn(In(r - 1))  ≠  0 if r  ≤  b - 1, whereas hn(In(r - 1)) = 0 if r  ≥  b. Then [formula] by Proposition [\ref=regconjfin].

Since r  ≥  4, we have n  ≥  2. Then r  ≥  m + 4. Indeed,

[formula]

if m > 1. So ρ  ≥  3 and r  ≤  m + 1 + ρ by Theorem [\ref=principal1]. In particular, σ > 0. We need only prove that r  ≥  m + 1 + ρ.

Let S denote the singular locus of η. Let I§ and IC be the sheaves of ideals of S and C, and [formula] that of [formula] in [formula]. Set j: = m + ρ - 2. Twisting the natural short exact sequence

[formula]

by j, and taking cohomology, we obtain the exact sequence

[formula]

Since S is finite, the last group is zero. Furthermore, since r  ≤  m + 1 + ρ, we have

[formula]

Since [formula] by Proposition [\ref=regsing], also H1(I§(j)) = 0. Thus

[formula]

Now, twist the natural short exact sequence

[formula]

by j, and take cohomology to get the exact sequence

[formula]

Since [formula], if we show that [formula], then it follows from the exactness of [\eqref=eql1] that H2(IC(j))  ≠  0, and hence that r  ≥  j + 3.

Since j + 3 = m + ρ + 1, we need only show that [formula]. Since C is invariant under η, and S is finite, we have that [formula], where

[formula]

with T(Ω1C) denoting the torsion subsheaf of Ω1C. Since C is subcanonical, [formula] by Proposition [\ref=regsub]. Furthermore, C is Gorenstein, whence [formula]. So, since j = m + ρ - 2 and r + ρ - 2 = σ, it follows that [formula] is equivalent to

[formula]

Let IΣC be the sheaf of ideals of ΣC in [formula]. Twisting the natural exact sequence

[formula]

by σ - 2, and taking cohomology, we get the exact sequence

[formula]

Since r  ≥  m + 4, we have

[formula]

So, since [formula], we have

[formula]

On the other hand, since ΣC is finite and nonempty, H1(IΣC(σ - 2))  ≠  0 by Proposition [\ref=regconjfin]. So, from the exactness of ([\ref=cohCsigma]) we get [\eqref=final].
