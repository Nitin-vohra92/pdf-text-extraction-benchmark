Quasitoric Manifolds with Invariant Almost Complex Structure

Introduction

Let M2n be an oriented closed compact manifold. We say that M2n is quasitoric over simple polytope P ([\cite=davis],[\cite=buchpanov]) if:

there is locally standart action of torus Tn on M2n and

there exists a map π:M2n  →  Pn which is a superposition of projection M2n  →  M2n / Tn and diffeomorphism of manifolds with corners M2n / Tn  →  P.

Any smooth projective toric variety gives the example of quasitoric manifold, but not vice versa. Any quasitoric manifold admits a canonical smooth structure ([\cite=mmj]).

Submanifolds of the form [formula], where Fj is a codimension one facet, are called characteristic submanifolds. An omniorientation of M2n is the orientation of M2n and all of its characteristic submanifolds. Every omniorientation determines a canonical Tn-invariant weakly complex structure on M2n ([\cite=mmj]), which may also be constructed in terms of characteristic map [formula].

Every smooth projective toric variety admits canonical Tn-invariant complex structure. One may ask the following question ([\cite=davis], Prob. 7.6): find the criterion for existence of Tn-invariant almost complex structure on quasitoric manifold M2n in terms of λ. In this paper we present the solution of this problem.

Tn-invariant weakly complex structure on manifold M2n with torus action α is an isomorphism cτ of bundle [formula] with complex vector bundle ξ. The map

[formula]

is complex-linear for every t.

If v is a fixed point for α, then there is a map [formula] where i is an injection and π' is a projection map along fixed subspace [formula]. The sign of v is the sign of determinant of the map [formula].

An equivalent definition of sign is as follows: we set [formula], if the orientations of τ(M)v determined by orientation of M and orientations of characteristic submanifolds coincide, and [formula], if not.

We call omniorientation positive, if signs of all fixed points are positive.

One can describe notion sign of a fixed point in terms of characteristic function λ. Let ej be a normal vector to facet Fj directed to interior of P. Then [formula] is equal to det (ej)  ·   det λv, where λv is a matrix composed of columns of λ that correspond to codimension one facets meeting in v.

Theorem 1 Quasitoric manifold M2n admits a Tn-invariant almost complex structure if and only if it admits a positive omniorientation.

Moreover, the following holds.

Theorem 2 Any Tn-invariant almost complex structure on M is equivariantly equivalent to canonical equivariant weakly complex structure [\cite=mmj].

This paper only contains the proof of theorem 1; the proof of theorem 2 will be published later. (Up to date, the proof exists, but only in Russian).

Remarks and examples

As follows from [\cite=panov], quasitoric manifold M with positive omniorientation and corresponding weakly complex structure J satisfies cn(J) = χ(M). So by [\cite=thomas], the structure J is equivalent to some almost complex structure on M, not necessarily Tn-invariant.

Every smooth projective toric variety M admits canonical Tn-invariant complex structure and symplectic form. So by [\cite=atiyah], there's a moment map π:M  →  P, where P is a simple convex polytope. Since all characteristic submanifolds of M are complex subvarieties, M has positive omniorientation.

Note that in real dimension 6 there exist examples of non-projective smooth toric varieties (see [\cite=buchpanov]). Nevertheless, the quotient by the action of T3 is still isomorphic to simple convex polytope. Finding an example of non-projective non-quasitoric smooth toric variety still remains an open problem.

Now we turn to examples of non-algebraic quasitoric manifolds. Denote by [formula] a connected sum of k copies of [formula] with standart orientation and smooth structure. As follows from equivariant connected sum constuction ([\cite=mmj]), all [formula]'s are quasitoric. Also, if k is odd, then [formula] admits a positive omniorientation. If k is even, then [formula] doesn't admit an almost complex structure.

Theorem 2.1 ([\cite=wu]) Let M4 be an oriented smooth manifold with no boundary. Then M admits an almost complex structure if and only if the number [formula] is integer. Here [formula] is the signature of a cohomology intersection form on M.

We have [formula] and this implies non-existence of almost complex structure on [formula] for even k.

From Theorem 1 we obtain that the manifold [formula] admits T2-invariant almost complex structure, if k is odd. But if [formula], [formula] can't be a toric variety since all toric varieties are rational and their Todd genus is equal to 1.

As follows from [formula], the manifold [formula] doesn't admit T2-invariant symplectic structure, if [formula].

Theorem 2.2 ([\cite=feldman]) Let M be a manifold equipped with a symplectic circle action with only isolated fixed points. Then td(M) = 1 if the action is Hamiltonian, and td(M) = 0 if not.

The proof of following result is based on Seiberg-Witten theory of four-dimensional manifolds.

Theorem 2.3 ([\cite=taubes]) The manifold [formula] doesn't admit a symplectic structure, if [formula].

Hence, manifolds [formula] with [formula], k odd, are neither symplectic manifolds nor toric varieties - but they admit Tn-invariant almost complex structure by Theorem 1.

Proof of theorem 1

The "only if" part of Theorem 1 is obvious. If J is an invariant almost complex structure on M, then all characteristic submanifolds of M are J-invariant and all signs of fixed points are positive. Therefore, it remains to show that existence of positive omniorientation implies the existence of invariant almost complex structure.

Notations

Denote by ski(P) the set of all i-dimensional facets of P. Let ι:P  →  M be an embedding of P to M satisfying the following conditions:

[formula];

restriction of ι on Int  G is smooth for any facet G  ⊂  P.

An example of such ι is given by composition P  →  P  ×  Tn  →  M, where the last map is factorization map ([\cite=buchpanov]).

We assume that M admits Tn-invariant metric g (see [\cite=bredon]). Then our problem is equivalent to constructing an operator J on τ(M) with following properties:

J2 =  - 1;

J commutes with dα(t) for every t∈Tn;

J is orthogonal with respect to the metric g.

Recall that the space of orthogonal complex structures on oriented vector space [formula] is homeomorphic to SO(2i) / U(i).

The words "structure on X" will mean "Tn-invariant complex structure on vector bundle τ(M) restricted on X".

If MG  =  π- 1(G) is a 2i-dimensional quasitoric submanifold in M, then we denote by [formula] two-dimensional vector bundles over M corresponding to (n - i) one-dimensional stationary toric subgroups [formula] of MG. The fibers of [formula] over MG are J-invariant since J commutes with dα.

We'll say that structure J on π- 1(Int  G) respects omniorientation o if it agrees with orientations of [formula] determined by o.

Let V be a real oriented Euclidean vector space of even dimension. Denote by [formula] the space of all complex structures of V respecting orientation and metric. The case of V = τ(MG)|x, where G  ⊂  P is a face, x∈ι(G), will be the most important. Recall that choosing a basis in V identifies [formula] with SO(2i) / U(i), where i  =   dim V. In particular, [formula] is simply connected.

We'll denote by [formula] the bundle with fiber [formula] over ι(G), which is associated with τ(MG)|ι(G). Clearly, [formula] is trivial. Consider the space [formula] of homeomorphisms [formula] onto itself induced by change of basis in the space τ(MG)|x.

Let us fix an arbitrary trivialization of τ(MG) over ι(G). Then it determines also a trivialization of associated bundle [formula]. Any other trivialization of [formula] is then determined by an arbitrary continious map [formula], where x∈ι(G) is some fixed point. Since SO(2i) is connected, [formula] is also connected. We obtain that the space of trivializations of [formula] determined by trivialization of τ(MG) over ι(G) is also connected.

Positivity and one-dimensional facets

Lemma 3.1 If MG  ⊂  M is a quasitoric submanifold, then [formula] and [formula], if j  ≠  k.

[formula] Let v∈τ(MG),vj∈ξj and vk∈ξk be nonzero vectors in the point x∈MG, and tπ∈Tj be an element of toric subgroup Tj corresponding to multiplication by - 1. Since Tj acts trivially on ξk and τ(MG), we have g(v,vj)  =  g(v,tπvj)  =  g(v, - vj) = 0 and g(vj,vk)  =  g(tπvj,vk)  =  g( - vj,vk) = 0. [formula]

Let o be any omniorientation of M, not necessarily positive. Then o determines structure J on π- 1(sk0(P)) in the following way: J is rotation by angle π / 2 in the direction specified by o on every fiber [formula], where x∈π- 1(sk0(P)).

Proposition 3.2 Let J be a structure on π- 1(sk0(P)) determined by o. Then J may be extended over π- 1(sk1(P)) if and only if o is positive.

[formula] Let us prove the "if" part first. Consider I  ⊂  P - an edge connecting vertices x0 and x1, [formula] - toric subgroups corresponding to I. Then [formula] over π- 1(I). The orientation of bundles [formula] over π- 1(I) is determined by o.

Denote by W0 and W1 orthogonal complements to [formula] at the points π- 1(x0) and π- 1(x1) respectively. Since J was constructed by o, J is a rotation by π / 2 in spaces W0 and W1. Note that W0 and W1 are tangent spaces to π- 1(I) at π- 1(x0) and π- 1(x1). The positivity of o implies that orientations of W0 and W1 agree as orientations of τ(π- 1(I)) = τ(S2). So we can define J on τ(π- 1(I)) as rotation by π / 2 in the direction specified by orientations of W0 and W1. On the bundles [formula] structure J is defined as rotation by π / 2 in the direction specified by o.

The "only if" part of Prop.3.2 is proved in similar fashion. If J is defined on entire π- 1(I), then the orientations of M at π- 1(x0) and π- 1(x1) agree - and that holds for every pair of adjacent vertices (x0,x1). [formula]

Triviality of higher obstructions

Now we consider the case i > 1. Suppose that J is defined on π- 1(ski - 1(P)) and we're trying to extend it over π- 1(ski(P)).

Lemma 3.3 Let G  ⊂  P be an i-dimensional facet. The space of positive structures J over π- 1(Int  G) is homeomorphic to space of continious mappings [formula], where x∈ι(Int  G) is a fixed point.

[formula] The positivity of J implies that J is uniquely defined on bundle [formula]. So it suffices to define J on the tangent vector bundle τ(π- 1(Int  G))≃τ(MG)|Int  G.

Denote by Ti any i-dimensional toric subgroup complementary to Tn - i in Tn. Then Ti acts freely on π- 1(Int  G) and the quotient by the action is homeomorphic to Int  G itself. Since J is Tn-invariant structure, it suffices to define J only on ι(Int  G). The bundle τ(MG) is trivial oriented 2i-dimensional real vector bundle over ι(Int  G) - and so J may be chosen in an arbitrary way over it (the only condition is that J must be orthogonal with respect to the metric g). If we fix some trivialization of associated bundle [formula] over ι(Int  G), then J is determined by an arbitrary continious map [formula], where x∈ι(G) is a fixed point. [formula]

Note that the bundle τ(MG) over ι(G) is also trivial. This implies existence of a canonical isomorphism of homotopy groups [formula] and [formula] for any points x,y∈ι(G). Recall that the homotopy groups [formula] are independent of choice of starting point if [formula], since J(τ(MG)|x)) is simply connected.

Let us fix a point x∈ι(G) and trivialization of bundle τ(MG) over ι(G). Then the bundle [formula] is also trivialized. Since J is already defined over τ(M)|ι(∂G) and τ(MG)  ⊂  τ(M) is J-invariant subbundle, we obtain a continious map [formula]. Denote by CG the homotopy class of spheroid f in πi - 1(J(τ(MG)|x)).

Now we'll show that the class CG is well-defined. Clearly, CG is independent of the choice of x. Suppose that we have changed trivialization of τ(MG) over ι(G). Then new trivialization is given by a continious map [formula] (see subsection 3.1). The map f is changed to g:∂G  →  J(τ(MG)|x)), where [formula].

Let [formula] be a continious family of maps satisfying φ0 = id,  φ1  =  φ (recall that [formula] is connected). Then family of maps [formula] provides a homotopy between f and g. This completes the proof of that CG is well-defined.

Note that CG depends on the orientation of G.

We summarize all in the following statement.

Lemma 3.4 Let J be a structure on π- 1(ski - 1(P)) respecting o. Then J may be extended over [formula] if and only if CG = 0 in the group πi - 1(SO(2i) / U(i)).

Every polytope P has a canonical cellular decomposition, with facets playing the role of cells. We define cellular cochain σiJ∈Ci(P,πi - 1(SO(2i) / U(i)) by the rule σiJ(G) = CG. By definition, σiJ is zero if and only if J may be extended from π- 1(ski - 1(P)) to π- 1(ski(P)).

Strictly speaking, to call σiJ a cocycle we have to identify all homotopy groups [formula] for all i-dimensional facets G  ⊂  P.

Lemma 3.5 Let dim G = i, [formula], x∈ι(G), y∈ι(P). Then homotopy groups [formula] and [formula] are canonically isomorphic.

[formula] Note that lemma 3.5 implies that σiJ is a cochain, since [formula]. Since homotopy groups [formula] and [formula] are canonically isomorphic, one can assume that x = y.

Consider an arbitrary embedding of two facets H  ⊂  L such that [formula]. Let x∈ι(H). Then there is an embedding of spaces of complex structures

[formula]

defined by formula [formula]. Here tπ / 2 is a rotation by π / 2 in two-dimensional orthogonal complement [formula]. The direction of tπ / 2 is specified by coorientation of τ(MH)|x in τ(ML)|x.

IF we fix the basis in τ(MH)|x and then add two vectors to obtain a basis in τ(ML)|x, then c(H,L) turns into a canonical embedding of homogeneous spaces SO(2r) / U(r)  →  SO(2r + 2) / U(r + 1), where r =  dim H.

Lemma 3.6 The map

[formula]

is an isomorphism for every [formula].

[formula] The embedding c may be viewed as the composition

[formula]

where first map is an embedding of fiber to bundle space over SO(2i + 2) / SO(2i) and the second map is a projection map of bundle space with fiber S2i + 1. An exact homotopy sequence now implies that c induces isomorphism of corresponding homotopy groups up to dimension 2i - 2. [formula]

Now we consider an arbitrary chain of embeddings [formula], where dim Gs + 1  =   dim Gs + 1 for every s. Define an isomorphism [formula] by formula [formula]. Then c*(G,P) is just what we need; it suffices to prove following statement.

Lemma 3.7 Isomorphism c*(G,P) is independent on the chain [formula].

[formula] Consider an arbitrary subchain of the form Gs - 1  ⊂  Gs  ⊂  Gs + 1. Then there exists a unique facet Q such that Gs - 1  ⊂  Q  ⊂  Gs + 1 and Gs  ≠  Q. If x∈Gs - 1, then the following diagram of embeddings

[formula]

is commutative. So if we replace Gs with Q, the resulting isomorphism c*(G,P) won't change.

We'll call two chains connecting G and P equivalent, if one may be obtained from another by sequence of operations we've just described. Let us prove by induction on n - i that any two chains connecting G and P are equivalent. The base statement (n - i = 1) is obvious since the chain is unique. Now consider two different chains [formula] and [formula]. Let Q  ⊂  P be a facet satisfying dim Q = i + 2, G11  ⊂  Q and G21  ⊂  Q. Consider an arbitrary chain ζ connecting Q and P. By induction hypothesis, two chains [formula] and [formula], where Q is connected with P by ζ, are equivalent. This means [formula] is equivalent to the chain [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is equivalent to [formula], due to the choice of Q. Finally, applying the induction hypothesis once more, we obtain that [formula] and [formula] are equivalent. [formula]

This lemma completes the proof of that σiJ is well-defined. We summarize this in the following statement.

Lemma 3.8 Let J be a structure on π- 1(ski - 1) respecting o. Then one can define an obstruction cochain σiJ∈Ci(P,πi - 1(SO(2i) / U(i)) which is zero iff J may be extended to π- 1(ski(P)).

Our next aim is to prove that σiJ is a cocycle.

Lemma 3.9. Suppose that J is a structure that respects o and is defined on π- 1(ski - 1(P)), Q is an (i + 1)-dimensional facet of P. Then

[formula]

[formula] Lemma 3.5 guarantees that we can use a single notation c*(G,Q) for all isomorphisms [formula], x∈ι(G),  y∈ι(Q).

The structure J on the bundle τ(MG)|ι(G) automatically defines structure c(J) on τ(MQ)|ι(G) by the formula [formula]. The bundle τ(MQ) may be trivialized over ι(Q). Since ι(G)  ⊂  ι(Q) for every G, there is a well-defined continious map [formula], y∈ι(Q) a fixed point. By its construction, homotopy class of fJ|∂G is equal to c*σiJ.

Let Uε be closed i-dimensional tubilar neighbourhood of [formula] in ∂Q (such that [formula] for every G). The set [formula] is a deformational retract of Uε, and the retraction determines a map J:Uε  →  SO(2i + 2) / U(i + 1). The space Uε is homeomorphic to i-dimensional sphere with k holes; let [formula] be the boundary spheres of the these holes.

[formula]

Then any homotopy class J|Sj coincides with c*σiJ(G), if Sj  ⊂  G. Since the sum of spheroids J|Sj must be zero in πi - 1(SO(2i + 2) / U(i + 1)), this completes the proof. [formula]

Lemma 3.10 Suppose that J is a structure on π- 1(ski - 1(P)) that respects o and σiJ is a coboundary. Then one can change J on [formula] and obtain new structure J' on π- 1(ski - 1(P)) such that σiJ' = 0.

[formula] By Lemma 3.6 the map c:SO(2i - 2) / U(i - 1)  →  SO(2i) / U(i) induces an isomorphism of homotopy groups up to dimension 2i - 4. If i > 2, then [formula], and if i = 2, then SO(4) / U(2) and SO(2) / U(1) are simply connected - so the map c*:πi - 1(SO(2i - 2) / U(i - 1))  →  πi - 1(SO(2i) / U(i)) is an isomorphism for i > 1.

Let σiJ  =  δβ and H be some (i - 1)-dimensional facet. The proof of lemma 3.5 implies that we can use a single notation c* for every isomorphism of the form [formula], where x∈H, y∈Gi, dim Gi  =  i. Now apply lemma 3.3: the space of structures on π- 1(Int  H) respecting o is homeomorphic to space of continious maps [formula]. Let [formula] be the map corresponding to J.

Let us identify Int  H with open (i - 1)-dimensional ball in [formula] of radius 1. Consider the map [formula] satisfying following conditions:

H(x)  =  fH((2|x| - 1)  ·  x), if [formula];

the homotopy class of spheroid [formula] is ( - c- 1*β(H)):

[formula]

If we replace fH with H, we'll obtain new structure J' on π- 1(ski(P)). Then σiJ'(G)  =  σiJ(G)  -  β(H) for every i-dimensional facet G such that H  ⊂  G. So if we replace fH with H for every (i - 1)-dimensional facet H  ⊂  P, we'll have σiJ' = 0, since σiJ  =  δβ. [formula]

Proof of the main theorem

Now we can prove theorem 1. Recall that we construct J by induction on i, starting from π- 1(sk0(P)). Proposition 3.2 and the positivity of o guarantee that J may be extended from π- 1(sk0(P)) to π- 1(sk1(P)). Lemmas 3.8 and 3.9 imply that for i > 1 obstruction to extending J from π- 1(ski - 1(P)) to π- 1(ski(P)) is a cocycle σiJ∈Ci(P,πi - 1(SO(2i) / U(i))). Since P has trivial homology, σiJ is a coboundary, so by Lemma 3.10 there exists structure J' on π- 1(ski - 1(P)) that may be extended to π- 1(ski(P)).
