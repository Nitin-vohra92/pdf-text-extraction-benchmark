Abstract

Introduction

A finite probability space is an ordered pair (S,p) where S is a finite set and p:S  →  [0,1] is a function such that

[formula]

The set S is called a sample space and its subsets are called events; when A and B are events, AB denotes [formula]. The probability (A) of event A is defined by

[formula]

when A and B are events with (B) > 0, the conditional probability (A|B) of A given B is defined by

[formula]

Hans Reichenbach (1956, p. 190) defined an event B to be causally between events A and C if the following relations hold:

[formula]

and

[formula]

(The conditional probabilities in ([\ref=cb2]) - ([\ref=cb4]) are well-defined: ([\ref=cb1]) guarantees that (A) > 0, (C) > 0 and ([\ref=cb5]) guarantees that (B) > 0. In terms of Reichenbach (1956, p. 189, pp. 201 - 205) equation ([\ref=cb4]) means that B screens off A from C.) Following Reichenbach's work, causal betweenness was considered by von Bretzel (1977), Ellett and Ericson (1986), Dowe (1992), Weber (1997), Korb (1999), and others.

Given a set X of events in a finite probability space, we let CB(X) denote the set of all ordered triples (A,B,C) such that A,B,C are events in X with properties ([\ref=cb1]) - ([\ref=cb5]). We say that a ternary relation B on a finite ground set is an abstract causal betweenness if, and only if, there is a set X of events in a finite probability space such that CB(X) is isomorphic to B. Our Theorem [\ref=thm1] characterizes abstract causal betweennesses by easily verifiable properties.

We call a ternary relation B a betweenness if

[formula]

The familiar concept of betweenness in Euclidean geometry generalizes in diverse branches of mathematics to betweennesses B with the property

[formula]

These relations include metric betweennes, lattice betweenness in modular lattices, and algebraic betweenness (see, for instance, Pitcher and Smiley (1942), Smiley (1943), Hashimoto (1958), Bumcrot (1964)). Our Corollary [\ref=cor1] asserts that every betweenness B with property ([\ref=trans]) is an abstract causal betweenness.

In Reichenbach's investigations, events occur in time and time order is reduced to causal order (Reichenbach 1956, p. 24). An event that is causally between events A and C does not necessarily occur between A and C (after A and before C, or else after C and before A). To elaborate on this point, we say that a ternary relation B on a finite set is totally orderable if, and only if, there is a mapping t from the ground set of B to a set with a total order [formula] such that

[formula]

Reichenbach (1956, p. 192) pointed out that B is not totally orderable when it includes the ordered triples (A1,A2,A3), (A1,A2,A4), (A4,A2,A3); these three triples, along with their reversals (A3,A2,A1), (A4,A2,A1), (A3,A2,A4), constitute an abstract causal betweenness. Therefore not every abstract causal betweenness is totally orderable.

Opatrný (1979) proved that recognizing totally orderable ternary relations is hard: the problem is NP-complete. (Readers unfamiliar with the notion of NP-completeness are referred to the monograph of Garey & Johnson (1979).) The problem does not get any easier when its input is restricted to abstract causal betweennesses: our Corollary [\ref=cor2] asserts that every totally orderable betweenness is an abstract causal betweenness, and so testing an arbitrary ternary relation B for total orderability reduces to testing an abstract causal betweenness for total orderability. (We first test B for being an abstract causal betweenness; Theorem [\ref=thm1] shows how to carry out this test easily; if B fails it, then Corollary [\ref=cor2] guarantees that B is not totally orderable.)

Results

With each betweenness B on a ground set X, we associate a directed graph G(B). Its vertices are all two-point subsets of X; its edges are all ordered pairs ({A,B},{A,C}) such that (ABC)∈B. These graphs may contain directed cycles: if {(DAB),(DBC),(DCA)}  ⊆  B, then G(B) contains the directed cycle

[formula]

if {(CAB),(DBC),(ACD),(BDA)}  ⊆  B, then G(B) contains the directed cycle

[formula]

and so on.

A ternary relation B on a finite set is an abstract causal betweenness if and only if B is a betweenness and G(B) contains no directed cycle.

Every betweenness B with the property

[formula]

is an abstract causal betweenness.

Every totally orderable betweenness is an abstract causal betweenness.

Proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

The "if" part: Consider an arbitrary betweenness B on a ground set X such that the directed graph G(B) contains no directed cycle. Without loss of generality, [formula] for some positive integer m. We shall construct a finite probability space and events [formula] in this space in such a way that Ej is causally between Ei and Ek if and only if (i,j,k)∈B.

The construction proceeds in two stages. First, we choose an arbitrarily small positive ε and we construct functions

[formula]

such that (i,j,k)∈B if and only if

[formula]

Then we construct a finite probability space and events [formula] in this space in such a way that

[formula]

In the first stage, we choose ε and δ so that

[formula]

Since G(B) contains no directed cycle, there is a mapping

[formula]

such that

[formula]

We set

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j. For all (i,j,k) in B, we set

[formula]

if i,j,k are distinct subscripts such that none of (i,j,k), (j,k,i), (k,i,j) is in B, then we choose γ({i,j,k}) in the interval (0.125,  0.125 + ε) and distinct from all three of

[formula]

The upper bound on δ guarantees that

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j and that

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j,k.

In the second stage, we begin with sample space {0,1}m and we set

[formula]

For each subset W of X, let χW denote the vector in {0,1}m, whose i-th coordinate is 1 if and only if i∈W. We will complete the proof by exhibiting a function p:{0,1}m  →  (0,1) such that

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j,k,

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j,

[formula]

for all subscripts i, and

[formula]

For this purpose, we set first

[formula]

and

[formula]

to satisfy ([\ref=3]) for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j,k, then

[formula]

to satisfy ([\ref=2]) for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j, then

[formula]

to satisfy ([\ref=1]) for all subscripts i, and finally

[formula]

to satisfy ([\ref=0]). Now

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j,k,

[formula]

for all choices of distinct subscripts i,j,

[formula]

for all subscripts i, and so the upper bound on ε guarantees that all p(χW) are positive.

The "only if" part: Consider an arbitrary set X of events in a finite probability space. Reichenbach (1956, p. 191) proved that CB(X) is a betweenness. We shall reproduce his argument here and we shall show that G(CB(X)) contains no directed cycle.

To prove that CB(X) is a betweenness, consider a triple (A,B,C) of events that satify ([\ref=cb1]) - ([\ref=cb5]). Assumption ([\ref=cb5]) guarantees B  ≠  A and B  ≠  C; assumption ([\ref=cb2]) guarantees (C|A) < 1, which implies C  ≠  A; now A,B,C are all distinct. Since the set of assumptions ([\ref=cb1]) - ([\ref=cb5]) is invariant under the switch A  ↔  C, the triple (C,B,A) satisfies them in place of (A,B,C). Finally, the triple (C,A,B) fails to satisfy ([\ref=cb4]) in place of (A,B,C) since ([\ref=cb4]) and ([\ref=cb2]) imply

[formula]

To see that G(CB(X) contains no directed cycle, observe that ([\ref=cb3]) implies

[formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor1]. Writing σ(A,B) for the number of elements D such that (ADB)∈B, observe that ([\ref=trans]) implies

[formula]

and so G(B) contains no directed cycle.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=cor2]. Consider an arbitrary betweenness B on a finite set along with a mapping t from the ground set of B to the set of real numbers such that

[formula]

Writing τ(A,B) = |t(A) - t(B)|, observe that

[formula]

and so G(B) contains no directed cycle.
