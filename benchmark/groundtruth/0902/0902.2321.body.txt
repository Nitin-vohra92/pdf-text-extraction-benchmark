A spin-wave frequency doubler by domain wall oscillation

The dynamic properties of ferromagnetic thin films have attracted much attention recently. In particular, the possibility to create logic circuits harvesting magnetic features such as domain walls [\cite=Allwood2005_1] and spin waves [\cite=Schneider2008_1] [\cite=Schneider2008_2] [\cite=Choi2007_1] [\cite=Lee2008_1] is in the focus of research activities. Thus, the excitation and propagation of spin waves and their interaction with domain walls is relevant to this research interest.

In this letter a new mechanism for the excitation and manipulation of spin waves is presented. In case when a pinned domain wall is excited by an external field with its eigenfrequency, a "steady-state" oscillation forms with this eigenfrequency and a distinct amplitude which is determined by the balance between energy dissipation processes due to damping and the external triggering by the applied field. The energy pumped into the system by the external field leads not only to the compensation of the damped oscillation, but also to the radiation of spin waves. It will be shown that the domain wall itself oscillates with the frequency of the externally applied field whereas the spin waves of twice that frequency are allowed to propagate.

To demonstrate the principle of a spin-wave frequency doubler, micromagnetic simulations using the LLG-code [\cite=LLG] were performed. The used material is Ni81Fe19 and standard values for this material (saturation magnetization [formula]=800 G, exchange constant [formula]=1.05 μerg/cm3) were used. The sample geometry is presented in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](a). A thickness of 5 nm and cell sizes of 10 nm for the x- and y-direction and 5 nm for the z-direction, respectively, have been used. In this configuration the domain wall is pinned at the two sides of the cross section area and therefore cannot move freely. [\cite=Petit2008_2] The starting configuration of the structure exhibits a tail-to-tail domain wall and is presented in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](a).

The resonant excitation of the domain wall is one of the most efficient means for creating spin waves. To determine this resonance frequency, the complete structure has been excited by a weak magnetic field pulse in x-direction. After performing a fast Fourier transformation (hereafter referred to as FFT), the local resonance frequency for each point of the structure can be obtained. The resonance frequency for the domain wall has been found to be 5 GHz, and this frequency has been used as the excitation frequency for the investigations presented in the following. By exciting the structure with an external magnetic field in x-direction (frequency 5 GHz, amplitude of 10 Oe), the domain wall starts to oscillate and emits spin waves. The amplitude of the external field is much smaller than the depinning field necessary to drive the domain wall out of its original position.

For a consistent study of this motion, the end of the transient phenomenon, i.e. the steady state of motion has to be reached. The oscillating domain wall emits spin waves whose wavelength was determined to be approximately 130 nm. A detailed insight into the observed phenomenon is given in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y]. In this figure, the temporal evolution of all three magnetization components along the x-axis is shown for a fixed y-position in the middle of the structure. The first column shows the first few nanoseconds of the oscillation. The domain wall can be clearly identified in the center of each panel. The externally applied field needs some time to force the wall to oscillate. After this transition which lasts approximately 1.5 ns, a regular oscillation of the wall can clearly be observed. The second column of panels gives an enlarged view of the steady-state oscillation over a duration of 1 ns. It clearly shows that the wall oscillates with a frequency of 5 GHz.

The spin-wave emission in the wider arms can be observed best in the y- and z-component (as defined in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y]), because these directions are perpendicular to the equilibrium orientation of the magnetization, and are zero in the initial state. In Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](b) the emission starts with the first movement of the wall as can be seen from the z-component. The mz-component of the wall changes its sign during the oscillation, as can be seen from the bright and dark areas in the middle of the graph. As the amplitude of the spin waves is small in comparison with the oscillation of the domain wall itself, the spin waves are only weakly visible in Figs. [\ref=cut_at_y](b) and (c).

The velocity of the spin waves emitted from the wall can be calculated using the slope of the straight lines indicated in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](d), yielding a value of 1.25 μm/ns. The interference pattern visible in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](d) results from spin waves created by the oscillating domain wall that propagate along the arm until the end of the structure, where they are reflected and overlap with the incoming waves.

The frequency of the propagating spin waves can be obtained by a Fourier transform, which yields a value of 10 GHz. Spin waves with the excitation frequency of the external field of 5 GHz can not propagate since the corresponding wavevector is imaginary due to the confinement of the spin waves by the stripe boundaries.

As mentioned above, the spin-wave emission depends on the oscillation in the mz-component. This component shows two anti-nodes as can be seen in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](c). This slight tilting of the magnetization out of the plane has already been reported for transverse walls.[\cite=Thomas2006_1] As expected for a driven oscillation at the resonance frequency the mx- and my-components oscillate with a phase shift of nearly π / 2 with respect to the externally applied field (see Fig. [\ref=field_components](a)). Unlike these two components, the mz-component does not follow this phase relation and shows a tilted oscillation curve which is partially in phase with the external field. This behavior is expected as the domain wall has to be driven by the externally applied field and, therefore, its phase shift is fixed to nearly π / 2. The domain wall can be monitored best in the mx- and my-component as in these components it appears as the region with mx=0 and my=1, respectively. Since the total magnetization remains constant, the motion of the domain wall, i.e. a moving area with my=1, causes the other two components to be zero at this position. In particular, this means that the mz-component is zero (as the mx-component is zero by definition at the position of the domain wall) and explains why this component is in phase with the external field.

As can be seen from Fig. [\ref=field_components](b), the waveforms of the oscillations at the positions, where the anti-nodes of the oscillation occur (i.e. at a position of 460 nm and 520 nm, respectively), are asymmetric in deviation from the sinusoidal waveform of the exciting external field and cause second harmonics generation in the spin-wave excitation.

Fig. [\ref=SW_radiation] presents an enlarged view of Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y]. The characteristic triangular shape of the z-component as presented in Fig. [\ref=cut_at_y](c) can be identified, resulting from the different velocities of the switching of the mz-component from positive to negative and vice versa. The frequency of this oscillation is still 5 GHz, as one red and blue area represents half a period each. The frequency doubling is clearly visible by the four beams radiated to both sides within one period (i.e. two maxima (dashed) and two minima (dotted)) and shows that the oscillation of the mz-component is essential for the excitation of the spin waves. The origin of these spin waves are the two oscillating anti-nodes of the oscillation, as can be seen from Fig. [\ref=SW_radiation]. The emission of two maxima in the bottom part of the z-component and one maximum in the top part in the case of positive anti-nodes and one minimum in the bottom part and two maxima in the top part for negative anti-nodes within one period can be identified. The oscillation of both of these points excites a new spin wave wavefront when switching from the positive mz-component to the negative and vice versa.

Thus, all three components oscillate with the frequency of the external field. As a result of the two anti-nodes in the mz-component which excite the spin waves by their oscillation, this component oscillates effectively with twice the driving frequency and allows for the excitation and frequency doubling of the waves.

In summary, dynamic micromagnetic simulations reveal the possibility to create spin waves by the excitation of a pinned domain wall with an external magnetic field. The pinning is necessary to drive the excited domain wall back to its equilibrium position. The properties of the created propagating spin waves such as frequency, wavelength, and velocity can be determined from the simulation data. The frequency doubling of the excited spin waves with respect to the externally applied field can be understood by the oscillation of the mz-component. As this component shows two anti-nodes which are oscillating non-uniformly but each of them with the given frequency, spin-wave wavefronts are created by both of these oscillations and frequency-doubled as two oscillations contribute to it.
