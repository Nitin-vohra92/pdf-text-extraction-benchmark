Transport Properties of a non-relativistic Delta-Shell Gas with Long Scattering Lengths

Introduction

Recently, studies of transport properties, particularly viscosities of interacting particles in a many-body system, have attracted much attention as observed phenomena in diverse fields of physics (such as atomic physics and relativistic heavy ions physics) are greatly influenced by their effects [\cite=ST09]. In atomic physics, the relaxation of atomic clusters from an ordered state have been observed [\cite=Kinast05]. In relativistic heavy-ion physics, viscosities influence the observed elliptic flow versus transverse momentum of final state hadrons [\cite=HMS09]. In both of these fields, the challenge of determining the transport properties at varying temperatures and densities has been vigorously pursued [\cite=ST09].

In this paper, we wish to study a simple system in which the high temperature properties of a dilute gas are significantly affected by the nature of two-body interactions. The two-body interaction chosen for this study - the delta shell interaction - allows us study the roles of long scattering lengths, finite-range corrections, and resonances. Our study is mainly pedagogical, but several universal characteristics are revealed. Our results stress the need to perform analyses beyond what we offer here, particularly with regard to contributions from higher than two-body interactions.

Gottfried's treatment [\cite=Gottfried66] [\cite=Gottfried04] of the quantum mechanics of two particles interacting through a delta-shell potential V(r) =  - v  δ(r - R), where v is the strength and R is the range, forms the basis of this work in which the transport properties of a dilute gas of non-relativistic particles are calculated for densities n for which the average inter-particle distance d  ~  n- 1 / 3  ≫  R. The delta-shell potential is particularly intriguing as the scattering length asl and the effective range r0 can be tuned at will, including the interesting case of asl  →    ∞   that is accessible in current atomic physics experiments (see, for e.g., Ref. [\cite=Kinast05]). The delta-shell potential also allows us to understand the transport characteristics of nuclear systems in which the neutron-proton and neutron-neutron scattering lengths (asl≃ - 23.8 fm and - 18.5 fm, respectively [\cite=slengths]) are much longer than the few fm ranges of strong interactions. In addition, the delta-shell potential admits resonances.

For small departures of the distribution function from its equilibrium, the net flows of mass, energy and momentum are characterized by the coefficients of diffusion, thermal conductivity and shear viscosity, respectively. Here we calculate these coefficients in first and second order of deviations (from the equilibrium distribution function) using the Chapman-Enskog method [\cite=Chapman]. In particular, we examine these transport properties for varying physical situations including the case of an infinite scattering length, i.e., the unitary limit, and when resonances are present.

Two-body interaction

We begin by collecting the two-particle quantum mechanical inputs [\cite=Gottfried66] [\cite=Gottfried04] [\cite=Antoine] and cast them in forms suitable for the calculation of the transport coefficients. The Hamiltonian for two particles interacting via the delta-shell potential is

[formula]

where μ denotes the reduced mass, [formula] is the Laplacian in spherical coordinates (L̂ is the orbital angular momentum operator), r is the separation distance, v and R are the strength and range parameters of the potential, respectively. In terms of the dimensionless variable ρ = kr (k is the wave number), [formula], and l the orbital quantum number, the general solution of Shrödinger equation is given by the spherical Bessel functions jl(ρ) and nl(ρ):

[formula]

The phase shifts δl are obtained through [\cite=Gottfried66]

[formula]

where x = kR, and the single dimensionless parameter

[formula]

controls all physical outcomes. At low energies (l = 0), the scattering length asl, the effective range r0 and the shape parameter P, are defined through [\cite=Newton] :

[formula]

[formula]

Note that as g  →  1, asl  →    ∞  , but r0 / R  →  4 / 3 and P  →  3 / 80. For l  >  0, Newton's generalization of scattering lengths and effective range parameters reads as [\cite=Newton]

[formula]

For the delta-shell potential, the l  ≥  0 results are

[formula]

[formula]

The scattering lengths in Eq. ([\ref=asll]) become very large for values of g  →  2l  +  1. In Fig. [\ref=asl_r0], we show asl and r0 as functions of the strength parameter g for l = 0. The diverging tendencies of of |asl| as g  →  1 and |r0| as g  →  0 are clearly evident. The case of g  →    -    ∞   corresponds to the hard-sphere case.

Transport coefficients

We turn now to calculate the coefficients of diffusion, thermal conductivity and shear viscosity, based on the Chapman-Enskog approach [\cite=Chapman] [\cite=thickbook]. The central ingredient is the transport cross-section of order n:

[formula]

where the scattering angle θ and the collisional differential cross-section [formula] are calculated in the center of mass reference frame of the two colliding particles. For indistinguishable particles, an expansion of the cross-section in partial waves [formula] and the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials Pl renders the integral above to the infinite sums

[formula]

The prime on the summation sign indicates the use of even l for Bosons and odd l for Fermions. In Eqs.  ([\ref=tr_crosssec_sum2]), the low energy hard-sphere cross section (g  →    -    ∞  ) 4πR2 has been used to render the transport cross sections dimensionless. If the particles possess spin s, then the properly symmetrized forms are:

[formula]

Here, we will present results for the case of spin-1/2 particles only. The transport coefficients are given in terms of the transport integrals

[formula]

where [formula] with the thermal de-Broglie wavelength λ = (2π2 / m  kBT)1 / 2.

In what follows, the coefficients of self diffusion [formula], shear viscosity η, and thermal conductivity κ are normalized to the corresponding hard-sphere-like values

[formula]

In the first order of deviations from the equilibrium distribution function, the transport coefficients are

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=Diffvisq]) shows clearly that if ω(2,2)1 is T-independent (as for hard-spheres with a constant cross section), the shear viscosity exhibits a T1 / 2 dependence which arises solely from its inverse dependence with λ(T). For energy-dependent cross sections, however, the temperature dependence of the viscosity is sensitive also to the temperature dependence of the omega-integral.

The second order results can be cast as

[formula]

where [formula] is [formula] or η or κ, and the ±   refers to Bose (+  ) and Fermi (-  ) statistics. For example,

[formula]

Asymptotic behavior

It is useful to define a characteristic temperature

[formula]

in terms of which limiting forms of the transport coefficients can be studied. For spin 1 / 2 statistics, Fig. [\ref=logDlogT] shows [formula] from Eq. ([\ref=Diffvisq]) normalized to [formula] from Eq. ([\ref=chars]). As expected, the diffusion coefficient grows steadily with temperature. For g  ≠  1,3, and for T  ≪  T̃, we find the asymptotic behavior (the dashed lines in Fig. [\ref=logDlogT])

[formula]

The cases g  →  1,3 require special consideration. In these cases, the asymptotic behavior for T  ≪  T̃ is obtained from a series expansion in x = kR of the transport cross sections q(n)(x) in Eqs.  ([\ref=tr_crosssec_sum2]), and subsequent integrations of Eq. ([\ref=tr_ints]). We find the limiting forms:

[formula]

The asymptotic behavior (for T  ≪  T̃) of the shear viscosity [formula] is similar to that of the diffusion coefficient:

[formula]

It is interesting that even at the two-body level, the coefficients of diffusion, thermal conductivity and viscosity acquire a significantly larger temperature dependence as the scattering length asl  →    ∞   ~ (g  →  1).

Figure [\ref=Dislf] shows the normalized viscosity coefficient as a function of [formula] for T  <  T̃. Enhanced cross sections at resonances produce significant drops in the viscosity as g  →  2l + 1. The widths of the dips in viscosity decrease with increasing values of l. For T  ≤  T̃, the dips become less prominent and disappear for T  ≥  T̃. For the densities and temperatures considered, the contribution from the second approximation is small as |δη|  <  0.15.

In Fig. [\ref=D1E3], the ratio of the coefficients of diffusion (times mn) and viscosity are shown as functions of R / asl for T  ≤  T̃. As expected, the largest variations in this ratio occur as g  →  2l + 1, that is, as resonances are approached. For T  ≪  T̃, the ratio approaches the asymptotic value 6 / 5 away from resonances and 4 / 5 for the S-wave resonance (a point). With increasing T, resonances become progressively broader with diminishing strengths; for T  ≈  T̃ resonances disappear. For comparison, this figure also includes results for hard spheres.

The coefficient of viscosity (as also mn times the coefficient of diffusion) has the dimension of action ([formula]) per unit volume. The manner in which the effective physical volume V changes as the strength parameter g is varied is illuminating as our results for T  ≪  T̃ in Table I shows. In the unitary limit (g = 1), the relevant volume is [formula]. For g = 3, [formula] (independent of asl), and for g  ≠  1,3, [formula] (independent of R).

Ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density

Recently, a lower limit to the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is being sought [\cite=loweretas] with results even lower than (4π)- 1(B) first proposed in Ref. X[\cite=Kovtun05]. We therefore examine 1,2 / s using the entropy density

[formula]

which includes the second virial correction [\cite=thickbook] to the ideal gas entropy density. The second virial coefficient [\cite=thickbook]

[formula]

where the prime indicates summation over even l's for Bosons (-  ) and odd l's for Fermions (+  ), El is the energy of the bound state with angular momentum l and ξ(T)  =  (λ / R)2 / (2π). The insert in Fig. [\ref=etaOs] shows a characteristic minimum of η / s versus T for fixed dilution nR3 and strength g. Values of 1,2 / s at the minimum are also shown functions of R / asl for several nR3. The lower (upper) curve for each nR3 corresponds to the first (second) order calculations of η. The large role of improved estimates of η on the ratio η / s is noticeable. The case of nR3 = 1 possibly requires an adequate treatment of many-body effects not considered here. We can, however, conclude that in the dilute gas limit η / s for the delta-shell gas remains above (1 / 4π)B.

Our analysis here of the transport coefficients of particles subject to a delta-shell potential has been devoted to the dilute gas (non-degenerate) limit, in which two-particle interactions dominate, but with scattering lengths that can take various values including infinity. Even at the two-body level considered, a rich structure in the temperature dependence and the effective physical volume responsible for the overall behavior of the transport coefficients are evident. The role of resonances in reducing the transport coefficients are amply delineated. Matching our results to those of intermediate and extreme degeneracies [\cite=Massignan] [\cite=Rupak07] which highlight the additional roles of superfluidty and superconductivity reveals the extent to which many-body effects play a crucial role.

Personal Note (Madappa Prakash)

This contribution to Gerry's Festschrift is in collaboration with my former graduate student Sergey Postnikov, who obtained his Ph.D degree in 2009, and who would have impressed Gerry with his originality. For Gerry, it is important that researchers be passionate about physics. I know that Sergey is in the category of people of whom Gerry would have approved. Gerry is very fond of schematic models that captures the essential physics. Our study here is an offer to the spirit in which the famous and classic Brown and Bolsterli paper [\cite=BB59] on "Dipole State in Nuclei" was written. I always chide him with the remark "You should strive for that excellence". He always retorts "What do you mean? I always do".

Gerry cares a lot about both undergraduate and graduate students. During the years 1981-2005, I have known of many instances in which he helped students to achieve their career goals, helping them with guidance in science, as well as with financial support (from his own purse when funds could not be arranged officially) and with emotional backing when needed.

I first saw his uncanny abilities with students during a course he taught with Kevin Bedell in 1982-83 on the applications of Landau Fermi-liquid theory. Gerry gave out many ideas, as a result of which, even before the end of the course, there were three articles written for Physical Review Letters, which were quickly accepted for publication. I was impressed.

To this day, I wish I had Gerry's ways with students. Gerry and I taught many courses together at Stony Brook. When we got students' evaluations, I usually got a numerical score that was better than Gerry's. However, students invariably said "Gerry is a fun teacher", a compliment that I never got. When we talked about our teaching skills, he said "how come I don't get your scores?" My reply was "how come I don't get your compliments?"

As Gerry is recovering from his illness, I am now supervising graduate student Constantinos Constantinou, who began his research with Gerry. I hope I do as well for Constantinos as Gerry would have done.
