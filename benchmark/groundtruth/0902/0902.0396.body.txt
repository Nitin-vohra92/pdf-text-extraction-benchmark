Interior capacities of condensers in locally compact spaces Natalia Zorii

The study is motivated by the known fact that, in the noncompact case, the main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers in a locally compact space is in general unsolvable, and this occurs even under very natural assumptions (e. g., for the Newton, Green, or Riesz kernels in [formula] and closed condensers). Therefore it was particularly interesting to find statements of variational problems dual to the main minimum-problem (and hence providing some new equivalent definitions of the capacity), but always solvable (e. g., even for nonclosed condensers). For all positive definite kernels satisfying B. Fuglede's condition of consistency between the strong and vague topologies, problems with the desired properties are posed and solved. Their solutions provide a natural generalization of the well-known notion of interior capacitary distributions associated with a set. We give a description of those solutions, establish statements on their uniqueness and continuity, and point out their characteristic properties. A condenser is treated as a finite collection of arbitrary sets with sing + 1 or - 1 prescribed, such that the closures of opposite-signed sets are mutually disjoint.

1. Introduction

The present work is devoted to further development of the theory of interior capacities of arbitrary (noncompact or even nonclosed) condensers in a locally compact space, started by the author in [\cite=Z3] [\cite=Z4]. For a background of that theory in the compact case, see the study by M. Ohtsuka [\cite=O].

The reader is expected to be familiar with the principal notions and results of the theory of measures and integration on a locally compact space; its exposition can be found in [\cite=B2] [\cite=E2] (see also [\cite=F1] [\cite=Z3] for a brief survey).

The theory of interior capacities of condensers provides a natural extension of the well-known theory of interior capacities of sets, developed by H. Cartan [\cite=Car] and Vallée-Poussin [\cite=VP] for classical kernels in [formula] and later on generalized by B. Fuglede [\cite=F1] for general kernels in a locally compact space [formula]. However, those two theories -- for sets and, on the other hand, condensers -- are drastically different. To illustrate this, it is enough to note that, in the noncompact case, the main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers is in general unsolvable, and this phenomenon occurs even under very natural assumptions (e. g., for the Newton, Green, or Riesz kernels in [formula] and closed condensers); compare with [\cite=Car] [\cite=F1]. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem to be solvable were given in [\cite=Z4] [\cite=Z6]; see Sec. 4.5 below for a brief survey.

Therefore it was particularly interesting to find statements of variational problems dual to the main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers, but in contrast to the last one, always solvable -- e. g., even for nonclosed condensers. (When speaking on duality of variational problems, we always mean their extremal values to be equal.)

In all that follows, [formula] denotes a locally compact Hausdorff space, and [formula] the linear space of all real-valued Radon measures ν on [formula] equipped with the vague topology, i. e., the topology of pointwise convergence on the class [formula] of all real-valued continuous functions on [formula] with compact support.

A kernel κ on [formula] is meant to be a lower semicontinuous function [formula]. To avoid some difficulties when defining energies and potentials, we follow [\cite=F1] in assuming that [formula] unless the space [formula] is compact.

The energy and the potential of a measure [formula] with respect to a kernel κ are defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively, provided the corresponding integral above is well defined (as a finite number or ±    ∞  ). Let E denote the set of all [formula] with -    ∞    <  κ(ν,ν) <   ∞  .

In the present study we shall be concerned with minimal energy problems over certain subclasses of E, properly chosen. For all positive definite kernels satisfying B. Fuglede's condition of consistency between the strong and vague topologies on E (see Sec. 2 below), those variational problems are shown to be dual to the main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers (and hence providing some new equivalent definitions of the capacity), but always solvable. See Theorems 2 - 4 and Corollaries 6, 8.

Their solutions provide a natural generalization of the notion of interior capacitary distributions associated with a set, introduced in [\cite=F1]. We shall give a description of those solutions, establish statements on their uniqueness and continuity, and point out their characteristic properties (see Sec. 6 - 9).

Condensers and their capacities are treated in a fairly general sense; see Sec. 3 and 4 below for the corresponding definitions.

2. Preliminaries: topologies, consistent and perfect kernels

Recall that a measure [formula] is said to be concentrated on E, where E is a subset of [formula], if the complement [formula] is locally ν-negligible; or, equivalently, if E is ν-measurable and ν  =  νE, where νE denotes the trace of ν upon E.

We denote by [formula] the convex cone of all nonnegative measures concentrated on E, and write [formula]. To shorten notation, write [formula].

From now on, the kernel under consideration is always assumed to be positive definite, which means that it is symmetric (i. e., κ(x,y) = κ(y,x) for all [formula]) and the energy κ(ν,ν), [formula], is nonnegative whenever defined. Then E is known to be a pre-Hilbert space with the scalar product

[formula]

and the seminorm [formula]; see [\cite=F1]. A (positive definite) kernel is called strictly positive definite if the seminorm [formula] is a norm.

A measure ν∈E is said to be equivalent in E to a given ν0∈E if [formula]; the equivalence class, consisting of all those ν, will be denoted by [formula].

In addition to the strong topology on E, determined by the above seminorm [formula], it is often useful to consider the weak topology on E, defined by means of the seminorms ν  ↦  |κ(ν,μ)|, μ∈E (see [\cite=F1]). The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

[formula]

implies immediately that the strong topology on E is finer than the weak one.

In [\cite=F1], B. Fuglede introduced the following two properties of consistency between the induced strong, weak, and vague topologies on E+:

(C)  Every strong Cauchy net in E+ converges strongly to every its vague cluster point;

(CW)  Every strongly bounded and vaguely convergent net in E+ converges weakly to the vague limit;

in [\cite=F2], the properties (C) and (CW) were shown to be equivalent.

Definition 1. Following B. Fuglede, we call a kernel κ consistent if it satisfies either of the properties (C) and (CW), and perfect if, in addition, it is strictly positive definite.

Remark 1. One has to consider nets or filters in [formula] instead of sequences, because the vague topology in general does not satisfy the first axiom of countability. We follow Moore's and Smith's theory of convergence, based on the concept of nets (see [\cite=MS]; cf. also [\cite=E2] and [\cite=K]).

Theorem 1 [\cite=F1]. A kernel κ is perfect if and only if E+ is strongly complete and the strong topology on E+ is finer than the vague one.

Examples. In [formula], [formula], the Newton kernel |x - y|2 - n is perfect [\cite=Car]. So is the Riesz kernel |x - y|α - n, 0 < α < n, in [formula], [formula] (see [\cite=D1] [\cite=D2]). Furthermore, if D is an open set in [formula], [formula], and its generalized Green function gD exists (see, e. g., [\cite=HK]), then the Green kernel gD is perfect as well [\cite=E1].

Remark 2. As is seen from Theorem 1, the concept of consistent or perfect kernels is an efficient tool in minimal energy problems over classes of nonnegative measures with finite energy. Indeed, the theory of capacities of sets has been developed in [\cite=F1] exactly for those kernels. We shall show below that this concept is still efficient in minimal energy problems over classes of signed measures associated with a condenser. This is guaranteed by the theorem on the strong completeness of proper subspaces of E, to be stated in Sec. 10 below.

3. Condensers. Measures associated with a condenser; their energies and potentials

3.1. Fix natural numbers m and m + p, where [formula], and write

[formula]

Definition 2. An ordered collection A = (Ai)i∈I of nonempty sets [formula], i∈I, is called an (m,p)-condenser in [formula] (or simply a condenser) if

[formula]

The sets Ai, i∈I+, and Aj, j∈I-, are said to be the positive and, respectively, negative plates of an (m,p)-condenser A = (Ai)i∈I. Note that any two equal-signed plates of a condenser are allowed to intersect each other.

Let [formula] denote the collection of all (m,p)-condensers in [formula]. A condenser [formula] is called closed or compact if all the plates Ai, i∈I, are closed or, respectively, compact. Similarly, we shall call it universally measurable if all the plates are universally measurable -- that is, measurable with respect to every nonnegative Radon measure.

Given A = (Ai)i∈I, write [formula]. Then, due to ([\ref=non]), [formula] is a (closed) (m,p)-condenser. In the sequel, also the following notation will be required:

[formula]

3.2. With the preceding notation, write

[formula]

Given [formula], let [formula] consist of all linear combinations of the form

[formula]

Any two μ1 and μ2 in [formula],

[formula]

are regarded to be identical ([formula]) if and only if μi1  =  μi2 for all i∈I.

Note that, under the relation of identity in [formula] thus defined, the following correspondence is one-to-one:

[formula]

We shall call [formula] a measure associated with a condenser A, and the measure μi, i∈I, its i-coordinate.

For any [formula] and [formula], define q1μ1 + q2μ2 to be an element from [formula] uniquely determined by the relations

[formula]

Then the set [formula] becomes convex.

3.3. Given [formula], denote by Rμ the Radon measure uniquely determined by either of the two equivalent relations

[formula]

[formula]

Of course, the mapping [formula] thus defined is in general non-injective, i. e., one can choose [formula] so that [formula], while Rμ' = Rμ. (It would be injective if all Ai, i∈I, were mutually disjoint.) We shall call [formula] equivalent in [formula], and write [formula], whenever their R-images coincide.

It follows from ([\ref=R]) that, for given [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

each of the above identities being understood in the sense that any of its sides is well defined whenever so is the other, and then they coincide. We shall call

[formula]

the mutual energy of μ and μ1 -- of course, provided the right-hand side of the corresponding relation is well defined. For [formula] we get the energy κ(μ,μ) of μ.

Since we make no difference between [formula] and Rμ when dealing with their energies or potentials, we shall sometimes call a measure associated with a condenser simply a measure -- certainly, if this causes no confusion.

Let E(A) consist of all [formula] with finite energy [formula]. Then E(A) is convex and can be treated as a semimetric space with the semimetric

[formula]

the topology on E(A) defined by means of this semimetric will be called strong.

Two elements of E(A), μ1 and μ2, are called equivalent in E(A) if [formula]. If, in addition, κ is assumed to be strictly positive definite, then the equivalence in E(A) implies that in [formula], namely then [formula].

3.4. For measures associated with a condenser, it is also reasonable to introduce the following concept of convergence, actually corresponding to the vague convergence by coordinates. Let S denote a directed set of indices, and let μs, s∈S, and μ0 be given elements of the class [formula].

Definition 3. A net (μs)s∈S is said to converge to μ0 A-vaguely if

[formula]

Since [formula] is a Hausdorff space, an A-vague limit in [formula] is unique (if exists).

Remark 3. The A-vague convergence of (μs)s∈S to μ0 certainly implies the vague convergence of (Rμs)s∈S to Rμ0. By using the Tietze-Urysohn extension theorem (see, e. g., [\cite=E2]), one can see that, for the converse to be true, it is necessary and sufficient that all [formula], i∈I, be mutually disjoint.

4. Interior capacities of (m,p)-condensers

4.1. Let H be a set in the pre-Hilbert space E or in the semimetric space E(A), where A is a given (m,p)-condenser. In either case, let us introduce the quantity

[formula]

interpreted as +    ∞   if H is empty. If [formula], one can consider the variational problem on the existence of λ  =  λ(H)∈H with minimal energy

[formula]

such a problem will be referred to as the H-problem. The H-problem is said to be solvable if a minimizer λ(H) exists.

The following elementary lemma is a slight generalization of [\cite=F1].

Lemma 1. Suppose H is convex, and λ  =  λ(H) exists. Then for any ν∈H,

[formula]

Proof. Assume H  ⊂  E. For every t∈[0,  1], the measure μ: = (1 - t)λ + tν belongs to H, and therefore [formula]. Evaluating [formula] and then letting t tend to zero, we get [formula], and ([\ref=lemma1]) follows (see [\cite=F1]).

Suppose now H  ⊂  E(A). Then RH: = {Rν: ν∈H} is a convex subset of E, while Rλ is a minimizer in the RH-problem. What has been shown thus yields

[formula]

which gives ([\ref=lemma1]) when combined with ([\ref=seminorm]).

We shall be concerned with the H-problem for various specific H related to the notion of interior capacity of an (m,p)-condenser (in particular, of a set); see Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 6 below for their definitions.

4.2. Fix a continuous function [formula] and a numerical vector a = (ai)i∈I with ai > 0, i∈I. Given a kernel κ and an (m,p)-condenser A in [formula], write

[formula]

Definition 4. We shall call the value

[formula]

the (interior) capacity of an (m,p)-condenser A (with respect to κ, a, and g).

Here and in the sequel, we adopt the convention that 1 / 0 =  +   ∞  . It follows immediately from the positive definiteness of the kernel that

[formula]

Remark 4. If I is a singleton, any (m,p)-condenser consists of just one set, A1, positively signed. If moreover g = 1 and a1 = 1, then the notion of interior capacity of a condenser, defined above, certainly reduces to the notion of interior capacity of a set (see [\cite=F1]). We denote it by C(    ·    ) as well.

Remark 5. In the case of the Newton kernel in [formula], the notion of capacity of a condenser A has an evident electrostatic interpretation. In the framework of the corresponding electrostatics problem, the function g serves as a characteristic of nonhomogeneity of the conductors Ai, i∈I.

4.3. On [formula], it is natural to introduce the ordering relation [formula] by declaring [formula] to mean that Ai'  ⊂  Ai for all i∈I. Here, A' = (Ai')i∈I. Then cap  (    ·    ,a,g) is a nondecreasing function of a condenser, namely

[formula]

Given [formula], denote by {K}A the increasing ordered family of all compact condensers [formula] such that [formula].

Lemma 2. If K ranges over {K}A, then

[formula]

Proof. We can certainly assume cap  (A,a,g) to be nonzero, since otherwise the lemma follows at once from ([\ref=increas]). Then the set E(A,a,g) must be nonempty; fix μ, one of its elements. For any K∈{K}A and i∈I, let μiK denote the trace of μi upon Ki. Applying Lemma 1.2.2 from [\cite=F1], we get

[formula]

Thus for K∈{K}A large enough, [formula] for all i∈I, and consequently

[formula]

Together with ([\ref=mon]) and ([\ref=mon']), this yields

[formula]

and hence, in view of the arbitrary choice of μ∈E(A,a,g),

[formula]

Since the converse inequality is obvious from ([\ref=increas]), the proof is complete.

Let E0(A,a,g) denote the class of all μ∈E(A,a,g) such that, for every i∈I, the support S(μi) of μi is compact and contained in Ai.

Corollary 1. The capacity cap  (A,a,g) remains unchanged if the class E(A,a,g) in its definition is replaced by E0(A,a,g). In other words,

[formula]

Proof. We can certainly assume cap  A to be nonzero, since otherwise the corollary follows immediately from the inclusion E0(A,a,g)  ⊂  E(A,a,g). Then, by ([\ref=increas]) and ([\ref=contin']), for every ε > 0 there exists a compact condenser [formula] such that

[formula]

This leads to the claimed assertion when combined with the relation

[formula]

4.4. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, in all that follows it is assumed that

[formula]

Lemma 3. The assumption ([\ref=nonzero1]) is equivalent to the following one:

[formula]

Proof. Indeed, cap  (A,a,g) is nonzero if and only if E(A,a,g) is nonempty. As g is positive, for the latter to happen, it is necessary and sufficient that, for every i∈I, there exists a nonzero nonnegative measure of finite energy concentrated on Ai. Since this is equivalent to ([\ref=cap1]) by [\cite=F1], the proof is complete.

In the following assertion, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for cap  A to be finite, we assume g|A to have a strictly positive lower bound (say L).

Lemma 4. For cap  (A,a,g) to be finite, it is necessary that

[formula]

This condition is also sufficient if it is additionally assumed that A is closed, g|A bounded, and κ bounded from above on A+  ×  A- and perfect.

Proof. Let cap  A  <    ∞  , and assume, on the contrary, that

[formula]

Then, for every i, there exist probability measures νin∈E+(Ai), [formula], of compact support such that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

and

[formula]

we arrive at a contradiction by letting n tend to ∞  .

Assume now all the conditions of the remaining part of the lemma to be satisfied, and let ([\ref=j]) be true. Then, by [\cite=Z5], there exists ζ∈E(A) with the properties that [formula] (hence, [formula]) and

[formula]

Since κ is strictly positive definite, this yields cap  A  <    ∞  , as was to be proved.

4.5. Because of ([\ref=nonzero1]), we are naturally led to the E(A,a,g)-problem (cf. Sec. 4.1), i. e., the problem on the existence of λ∈E(A,a,g) with minimal energy

[formula]

the E(A,a,g)-problem might certainly be regarded as the main minimum-problem of the theory of interior capacities of condensers. The collection (possibly empty) of all minimizing measures λ in this problem will be denoted by S(A,a,g).

If moreover cap  (A,a,g) is finite, let us look, as well, at the E(A,a  cap  A,g)-problem. By reasons of homogeneity, both the E(A,a,g)- and the E(A,a  cap  A,g)-problems are simultaneously either solvable or unsolvable, and their extremal values are related to each other by the following law:

[formula]

Assume for a moment that A is compact. Since the mapping

[formula]

where [formula] is a compact set, is vaguely continuous, E(A,a,g) is compact in the A-vague topology. Therefore, if κ is additionally assumed to be continuous on A+  ×  A- (which, due to ([\ref=non]), is always the case for either of the classical kernels), then the energy [formula] is A-vaguely lower semicontinuous on E(A), and the solvability of both the problems immediately follows (cf. [\cite=O]).

But if A is noncompact, then the class E(A,a,g) is no longer A-vaguely compact and the problems become quite nontrivial. Moreover, it has recently been shown by the author that, in the noncompact case, the problems are in general unsolvable and this phenomenon occurs even under very natural assumptions (e. g., for the Newton, Green, or Riesz kernels in [formula], [formula], and closed condensers).

In particular, it was proved in [\cite=Z4] that, if A is closed, κ is perfect, and bounded and continuous on A+  ×  A-, and satisfies the generalized maximum principle (see, e. g., [\cite=L]), while g|A is bounded and has a strictly positive lower bound, then for either of the E(A,a,g)- and the E(A,a  cap  A,g)-problems to be solvable for any vector a, it is necessary and sufficient that

[formula]

If moreover there exists i0∈I such that

[formula]

then both the problems are unsolvable for all a = (ai)i∈I with ai0 large enough.

In [\cite=Z6], the last statement was sharpened. It was shown that if, in addition to all the preceding assumptions, for all i  ≠  i0,

[formula]

while [formula] (as y  →    ∞  ) uniformly on compact sets, then there exists a number Λi0∈[null] write

[formula]

Clearly,

[formula]

and consequently

[formula]

The coefficient of τ2 is bounded from above on T (say by M0), while by Lemma 5

[formula]

From ([\ref=2.1]) and ([\ref=3.4]) we therefore obtain

[formula]

By letting here τ tend to 0, we arrive at a contradiction to ([\ref=3.3]).

It has thus been proved that ηi, i∈I, defined by means of ([\ref=2.1]), satisfy ([\ref=1.1]). Note that κ(    ·    ,Rχ), being the potential of a measure of finite energy, is finite nearly everywhere in [formula] (see [\cite=F1]), and hence so is κ(    ·    ,χ). Since, by Lemma 3, C(Ai) > 0 for all i∈I, it follows from ([\ref=1.1]) that

[formula]

Hence, [formula] is well defined and, by ([\ref=2.1]),

[formula]

This means that ηi, i∈I, are finite and satisfy also ([\ref=1.2]) as required.

To prove the statement on uniqueness, consider some other η'i, i∈I, satisfying both ([\ref=1.1]) and ([\ref=1.2]). Then they are necessarily finite, and for every i,

[formula]

which follows from the property of subadditivity of C(    ·    ), mentioned in Sec. 6.1. Since μit is concentrated on Ai and has finite energy and compact support, application of [\cite=F1] shows that the inequality in ([\ref=4.1]) holds μit-almost everywhere in [formula]. Integrating it with respect to μit and then summing up over all i∈I, in view of [formula] we have

[formula]

Passing here to the limit as t ranges over T, we get

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

for the extreme left and right parts of the above chain of inequalities are equal. Applying the same arguments again, but with the roles of ηi and η'i reversed, we conclude that ηi  =  η'i for all i∈I, as claimed.

It remains to show that ηi, i∈I, can be written in the form ([\ref=1.3']) or ([\ref=1.3'']). To this end, fix [formula]. Then it follows at once from the above reasoning that, for every i∈I, any cluster point of the net κ(μis,μs), s∈S, coincides with ηi. Hence, there exists lim s∈S  κ(μis,μs) and it equals ηi.

Passing to a subnet if necessary, by Lemma 8 we can also assume (μs)s∈S to be A-vaguely convergent, say to ζ. The proof will be completed once we prove

[formula]

Since [formula] is bounded from above on S (say by M1), while μis  →  ζi vaguely, the property (CW) yields that μis approaches ζi also weakly. Hence, for every ε > 0,

[formula]

whenever s∈S is large enough. Furthermore, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,

[formula]

Since, by Lemma 5, μs  →  ζ strongly, the last two relations combined give ([\ref=proof]).

12.2. In what follows, ηi = :ηi(A,a,g), i∈I, will always denote the numbers appeared in Lemma 9. They are uniquely determined by relation ([\ref=1.1]), where χ∈M'(A,a,g) is arbitrarily chosen, taken together with ([\ref=1.2]). This statement on uniqueness can actually be strengthened as follows.

Lemma 9'. Given χ∈M'(A,a,g), choose η'i, i∈I, so that

[formula]

If there holds ([\ref=1.1]) for η'i in place of ηi, then η'i  =  ηi for all i∈I.

Proof. This follows in the same manner as the uniqueness statement in Lemma 9.

12.3. The following assertion is specifying Lemma 9 for a compact condenser K.

Corollary 11. Let A  =  K be compact. Given λK∈S(K,a,g), then for every i,

[formula]

Proof. In view of ([\ref=S]) and ([\ref=1.3']), ηi(K,a,g), i∈I, can be written in the form

[formula]

which leads to ([\ref=hh]) when substituted into ([\ref=1.1]). Since λiK has finite energy and is supported by Ki, the inequality in ([\ref=hh]) holds λiK-almost everywhere in [formula]. Hence, ([\ref=1.1'']) must be true, for if not, we would arrive at a contradiction by integrating the inequality in ([\ref=hh]) with respect to λiK.

13. Potentials of A-vague cluster points of minimizing nets

In this section we shall restrict ourselves to measures ξ of the class M0(A,a,g). It is clear from Corollary 3 that their potentials have all the properties described in Lemmas 9 and 9'. Our purpose is to show that, under proper additional restrictions on the kernel, that description can be sharpened as follows.

Lemma 10. In the case where [formula], assume moreover that κ(x,y) is continuous for x  ≠  y, while [formula] (as y  →    ∞  ) uniformly on compact sets. Given ξ∈M0(A,a,g), then for all i∈I,

[formula]

Proof. Choose λK∈S(K,a,g) such that ξ is an A-vague cluster point of the net (λK)K∈{K}A. Since this net belongs to [formula], from ([\ref=1.3']) and ([\ref=1.3'']) we get

[formula]

Substituting this into ([\ref=1.1]) with ξ in place of χ gives ([\ref=1.11]) as required.

We next proceed to prove ([\ref=desc4']). To this end, fix i (say i∈I+) and x0∈S(ξi). Without loss of generality it can certainly be assumed that

[formula]

since otherwise we shall pass to a subnet and change the notation. Then, due to ([\ref=1.1'']) and ([\ref=l11]), there exist xK∈S(λiK) with the following properties:

[formula]

[formula]

Taking into account that, by [\cite=F1], the map

[formula]

is lower semicontinuous on [formula] in the topology of a Cartesian product (where [formula] is equipped with the vague topology), we conclude from what has already been shown that the desired relation ([\ref=desc4']) will follow once we prove

[formula]

where j∈I- is arbitrarily chosen.

The case we are thus left with is [formula]. Then, according to our standing assumptions, gmin > 0, and therefore there exists q∈(0,  ∞  ) such that

[formula]

Hence, by ([\ref=l11]),

[formula]

Fix ε > 0. Under the assumptions of the lemma, one can choose a compact neighborhood Wx0 of the point x0 and a compact neighborhood F of the set Wx0 so that

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the remainder, [formula] and ∂j denote respectively the complement and the boundary of a set relative to [formula], where [formula] is treated as a topological subspace of [formula].

Having observed that [formula]  is continuous, we proceed to construct a function

[formula]

with the following properties:

[formula]

[formula]

To this end, consider a compact neighborhood Vj of Fj in [formula], and write

[formula]

Note that [formula] is a compact subset of the Hausdorff and compact, hence normal, space Wx0  ×  Vj, and f is continuous on E. By using the Tietze-Urysohn extension theorem (see, e. g., [\cite=E2]), we deduce from ([\ref=115]) that there exists a continuous function : Wx0  ×  Vj  →  [ -   εq -  1,εq -  1] such that |E = f|E. Thus, the function in question can be defined as follows:

[formula]

Furthermore, since the function φ is continuous on [formula] and has compact support, there exists a compact neighborhood Ux0 of x0 such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Given an arbitrary measure [formula] with the property that [formula], we conclude from ([\ref=115]) - ([\ref=119]) that, for all x∈Ux0,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Finally, choose K0∈{K}A so that, for all [formula], there hold xK∈Ux0 and

[formula]

such a K0 exists in view of ([\ref=l11]) and ([\ref=l112]). Applying now ([\ref=121]) - ([\ref=124]) to each of λjK and ξj, which is possible due to ([\ref=qq]) and ([\ref=xi]), for all [formula] we therefore get and ([\ref=hr]) follows by letting ε tend to 0. The proof is complete.

14. Proof of Theorems 2 and 3

We begin by showing that

[formula]

To this end, [formula] can certainly be assumed to be finite. Then there are ν∈(A,a,g) and μ∈E0(A,a,g), the existence of μ being clear from ([\ref=nonzero1]) and Corollary 1. By [\cite=F1], the inequality in ([\ref=adm1]) holds μi-almost everywhere. Integrating it with respect to μi and then summing up over all i∈I, in view of [formula] we get

[formula]

hence [formula] by ([\ref=adm2]), and finally

[formula]

by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The last relation, being valid for arbitrary ν∈(A,a,g) and μ∈E0(A,a,g), forces ([\ref=1]).

The inequality ([\ref=1]) establishes Theorem 2 in the case where cap  A  =    ∞  .

We are thus left with proving both Theorems 2 and 3 for the case cap  A  <    ∞  . Then the E(A,a  cap  A,g)-problem can be considered as well.

Taking ([\ref=def]) and ([\ref=iden]) into account, we deduce from Lemmas 5 and 9 with a replaced by a  cap  A that, for every χ∈M'(A,a  cap  A,g),

[formula]

and there exist unique [formula], i∈I, such that

[formula]

[formula]

Actually,

[formula]

where ηi(A,a  cap  A,g), i∈I, are the numbers uniquely determined in Sec. 12.

Using the property of subadditivity of C(    ·    ), mentioned in Sec. 6.1, and the fact that the potentials of equivalent in E measures coincide nearly everywhere in [formula], we conclude from ([\ref=tilde1]) and ([\ref=tilde2]) that

[formula]

Together with ([\ref=1]) and ([\ref=2]), this implies that, for every σ∈M'E(A,a  cap  A,g),

[formula]

which completes the proof of Theorem 2. The last two relations also yield

[formula]

As both the sides of this inclusion are equivalence classes in E (see Lemmas 5 and 6), they must actually be equal, and ([\ref=desc]) follows.

Applying Lemma 9' for a  cap  A in place of a, we deduce from ([\ref=desc]) that ci(), i∈I, satisfying ([\ref=adm1]) and ([\ref=adm2]) for ν  =  ∈(A,a,g), are determined uniquely, do not depend on the choice of [formula], and are actually equal to [formula]. Therefore, substituting ([\ref=1.3']) and, subsequently, ([\ref=1.3'']) for a  cap  A in place of a into ([\ref=tilde3]), we get ([\ref=snt1]) and ([\ref=cnt]). This proves Theorem 3.

15. Proof of Theorem 5

We start by observing that D(A,a,g) is nonempty, contained in an equivalence class in [formula], and satisfies the inclusions

[formula]

Indeed, this follows from ([\ref=D]), Corollary 3, and Lemma 5, the last two being taken for a  cap  A in place of a. Substituting ([\ref=desc2]) into ([\ref=DD]) gives ([\ref=gammain]) as required.

Since, by ([\ref=gammain]), every γ∈D(A,a,g) is a minimizer in the Γ(A,a,g)-problem, the claimed relations ([\ref=5.1]) and ([\ref=5.3]) are obtained directly from Theorem 3 and 4 in view of Definition 5. To show that Ci(A,a,g), i∈I, can actually be given by means of ([\ref=5.2]), one only needs to substitute γ instead of ζ into ([\ref=snt1]) -- which is possible due to ([\ref=DD]) -- and use Corollary 4.

Assume for a moment that, if [formula], then κ(x,y) is continuous for x  ≠  y, while [formula] (as y  →    ∞  ) uniformly on compact sets. In order to establish ([\ref=5.4]), it suffices to apply Lemma 10 (with a  cap  A in place of a) to γ, which can be done because of ([\ref=D]), and then substitute ([\ref=5.2]) into the result obtained.

To prove that D(A,a,g) is A-vaguely compact, fix (γs)s∈S  ⊂  D(A,a,g). Then the inclusion ([\ref=gammain]) and Lemma 7 yield that this net is A-vaguely bounded, and hence A-vaguely relatively compact. Let γ0 denote one of its A-vague cluster points, and let (γt)t∈T be a subnet of (γs)s∈S that converges A-vaguely to γ0. In view of ([\ref=D]), the proof will be completed once we show that

[formula]

By ([\ref=D]), for every t∈T there exist a subnet (Kst)st∈St of the net (K)K∈{K}A and

[formula]

such that λst approaches γt A-vaguely as st ranges over St. Consider the Cartesian product [formula] -- that is, the collection of all functions ψ on T with ψ(t)∈St, and let D denote the directed product [formula] (see, e. g., [\cite=K]). Given (t,ψ)∈D, write

[formula]

Then application of Theorem 4 from [\cite=K] yields that (λ(t,ψ))(t,ψ)∈D converges A-vaguely to γ0. Since, as can be seen from the above construction, (K(t,ψ))(t,ψ)∈D forms a subnet of (K)K∈{K}A, this proves ([\ref=GG]) as required.

16. Proof of Proposition 2

Consider [formula] and [formula], i∈I, satisfying both the assumptions ([\ref=desc3']) and ([\ref=adm2'']), and fix arbitrarily γA∈D(A,a,g) and [formula]. Since μit is concentrated on Ai and has finite energy and compact support, the inequality in ([\ref=desc3']) holds μit-almost everywhere. Integrating it with respect to μit and then summing up over all i∈I, in view of ([\ref=5.1]) and ([\ref=adm2'']) we obtain

[formula]

But (μt)t∈T converges to γA in the strong topology of the semimetric space [formula], which is clear from ([\ref=DD]) and Lemma 5 with a  cap  A instead of a. Therefore, passing in the preceding relation to the limit as t ranges over T, we get

[formula]

which is a part of the conclusion of the proposition. In turn, the preceding relation implies that, actually, the right-hand side in ([\ref=adm2'']) is equal to 1, and that ν∈M'(A,a  cap  A,g). Since, in view of Theorem 3, the latter means that

[formula]

the claimed relation ([\ref=un]) follows.

17. Proof of Theorem 6

To establish ([\ref=6.1]), fix μ∈E(A,a,g). Under the assumptions of the theorem, either gmin > 0, and consequently [formula] for all i∈I, or [formula] is countable at infinity; in any case, every Ai, i∈I, is contained in a countable union of μi-integrable sets. Therefore, by [\cite=B2] [\cite=E2] (cf. the appendix below),

[formula]

where μiAn denotes the trace of μi upon Ain. Now, applying the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 2, but with the preceding two relations instead of ([\ref=mon]) and ([\ref=mon']), we arrive at ([\ref=6.1]) as required.

By ([\ref=nonzero1]) and ([\ref=6.1]), for every [formula], cap  (An,a,g) can certainly be assumed to be nonzero. Suppose moreover that cap  (A,a,g) is finite; then, by ([\ref=increas]), so is cap  (An,a,g). Hence, according to Theorem 5, there exists

[formula]

Observe that Rγn is a minimizer in the (An,a,g)-problem, which is clear from ([\ref=desc]), ([\ref=desc2]), and ([\ref=gammain]). Since, furthemore,

[formula]

application of Lemma 1 to H  =  (An,a,g), ν = Rγn + 1, and λ = Rγn gives

[formula]

Also note that [formula], [formula], is a Cauchy sequence in [formula], because, by ([\ref=6.1]), its limit exists and, being equal to cap  A, is finite. The preceding inequality therefore yields that [formula] is a strong Cauchy sequence in the semimetric space [formula].

Besides, since [formula], we derive from ([\ref=gammain]) that

[formula]

Hence, by Theorem 7, there exists an A-vague cluster point γ of [formula], and

[formula]

Let (γt)t∈T denote a subnet of the sequence [formula] that converges A-vaguely and strongly to γ. We next proceed to show that

[formula]

For every t∈T, consider the ordered family {Kt}At of all compact condensers [formula]. By ([\ref=17.1]), there exist a subnet (Kst)st∈St of (Kt)Kt∈{Kt}At and

[formula]

such that (λst)st∈St converges both strongly and A-vaguely to γt. Consider the Cartesian product [formula], that is, the collection of all functions ψ on T with ψ(t)∈St, and let D denote the directed product [formula]. Given (t,ψ)∈D, write

[formula]

Then application of Theorem 4 from [\cite=K] yields that (λ(t,ψ))(t,ψ)∈D converges both strongly and A-vaguely to γ. Since (K(t,ψ))(t,ψ)∈D is easily checked to form a subnet of (K)K∈{K}A, this proves ([\ref=theta]) as required.

What is finally left is to prove ([\ref=6.3]). By Corollary 9, for every [formula] one can choose a compact condenser [formula] so that

[formula]

This K0n can certainly be chosen so large that the sequence obtained, [formula], forms a subnet of (K)K∈{K}A; therefore, repeated application of Corollary 9 yields

[formula]

This leads to ([\ref=6.3]) when combined with the preceding relation.

19. Appendix

Let [formula] be given. As in [\cite=E2], a set [formula] is called ν-σ-finite if it can be written as a countable union of ν-integrable sets.

The following assertion, related to the theory of measures and integration, has been used in Sec. 17. Although it is not difficult to deduce it from [\cite=B2] [\cite=E2], we could not find there a proper reference.

Lemma 11. Consider a lower semicontinuous function ψ on [formula] such that [formula] unless the space [formula] is compact, and let E be the union of an increasing sequence of ν-measurable sets En, [formula]. If moreover E is ν-σ-finite, then

[formula]

Proof. We can certainly assume ψ to be nonnegative, for if not, we replace ψ by a function ψ' obtained by adding to ψ a suitable constant c > 0:

[formula]

which is always possible since a lower semicontinuous function is bounded from below on a compact space. Then, for every ν-measurable and ν-σ-finite set Q,

[formula]

where φQ(x) equals 1 if x∈Q, and 0 otherwise. Indeed, this can be concluded from [\cite=E2] (see Propositions 4.14.1 and 4.14.6).

On the other hand, since ψφEn, [formula], are nonnegative and form an increasing sequence with the upper envelope ψφE, [\cite=E2] gives

[formula]

Applying ([\ref=Q]) to both the sides of this equality, we obtain the lemma.
