Quadrics via Semigroups

This is the story of the rediscovery of classical three-dimensional geometry, especially the geometry of quadric surfaces, while studying the semigroup [formula] of linear endomorphisms of a real plane. One of the surfaces that appears prominently in this context is the hyperboloid of one sheet, referred to as spaghetti bundle in [\cite=Samu:88]. In this story the spaghetti presents itself as the set of idempotents in [formula], the cone emerges as the set of nilpotent elements and the hyperbolic paraboloid as the set of semigroup-theoretic inverses of a singular element.

This rediscovery was briefly announced in [\cite=Kris:00]. Generalizations of some of the ideas presented here to semigroups of linear endomorphisms of higher dimensional vector spaces are discussed in [\cite=Kris:03]. The little bit of semigroup theory quoted below is based on [\cite=Clif+:61].

The Semigroup [formula]

A set S together with an associative binary operation in S is called a semigroup. An element e in S is called an idempotent if e2 = e. If X  ⊆  S, the set of idempotents in X is denoted by E(X). In any semigroup S we can define certain equivalence relations, denoted by [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], and called Green's relations. Let S1 denote S if S has an identity element. Otherwise, let it denote S with an identity element 1 adjoined. For a,b∈S the first three are defined by and the remaining ones by [formula], [formula].

If a∈S, the set of all elements in S which are [formula]-equivalent to a is denoted by La and is called the [formula]-class containing a. The notations Ra,Ja,Da,Ha have similar meanings. These are the Green classes in S. Two elements a,a' in a semigroup S are called inverse elements if aa'a = a, a'aa' = a'. A semigroup in which every element has an inverse is called a regular semigroup.

A well-known example of a regular semigroup is [formula] (where [formula], or [formula]) of linear endomorphisms of an n-dimensional vector space V over [formula] under composition of mappings. The set  of singular elements in [formula] is a regular subsemigroup of [formula]. Treating functions as right operators we see that, for [formula], [formula] if and only if a and b have the same range, and, [formula] if and only if a and b have the same null space. Further, [formula] if and only if a and b have the same rank, and, [formula] is equivalent to [formula].

As already indicated, the semigroup having special interest to us is [formula], denoted by M2 in the sequel. We shall represent elements of M2 as square matrices of order 2 relative to some fixed ordered orthonormal basis for V. Listing out the entries in the elements of M2 row-wise we get vectors in [formula]. In this way we may identify M2 with [formula]. The usual inner product in [formula] can be represented using the trace function, defined by [formula]. If [formula] and [formula] then

[formula]

where x* is the transpose of x.

Geometry of the Green Classes in M2

M2 has three [formula]-classes, namely, D0, D1 and D2, where Dk is the set of endomorphisms of rank k. Obviously we have D0  =  {0} which is simply a point. From the well-known fact (p.168 [\cite=Bori:85]) that the space M(m,n,k) of m  ×  n matrices of rank k is a manifold of dimension k(m + n - k) we immediately deduce that D1 is a three-dimensional submanifold of [formula]. What this means is that sufficiently small neighborhoods of every point in D1 'looks like' a three-dimensional euclidean space. Lastly D2 is the set [formula] of all invertible elements in M2. It is well known that [formula] is a four-dimensional submanifold of [formula].

To describe the [formula]- and [formula]-classes in M2, we require some geometric terminology. A line in a linear space U is an affine subspace of U generated by two distinct points (that is, vectors) in U and a plane P in U is an affine subspace generated by three non-collinear points in U. If P passes through the origin in U then the set [formula] is called a punctured plane in U. In a similar way we may define a punctured line in U.

If 0 = a∈M2, then La = Ra  =  {0}. Also, if [formula] then [formula]. The classes La and Ra, when a  ≠  0 and [formula], are the nontrivial [formula]- and [formula]-classes in M2. If [formula], a simple argument involving range and null space shows that

[formula]

These are obviously punctured planes. That this is true for any [formula] can be easily verified.

If [formula], then La and Ra are punctured planes lying in [formula].

Surprisingly, the converse of Proposition [\ref=Prop.ii.2.2] is also true, that is, every punctured plane in [formula] is a nontrivial [formula]-class or [formula]-class in [formula]. A nontrivial [formula]-class, being the intersection of a nontrivial [formula]-class and a nontrivial [formula]-class, is a punctured line in [formula].

Intersection of [formula] with x1 + x4  =  λ

We have seen that D1 is a three-dimensional manifold sitting in [formula]. To know more about this manifold we consider intersections of [formula] with hyperplanes in M2. A hyperplane in M2 is the set of all [formula] satisfying an equation of the form

[formula]

where [formula]. This equation can be expressed in the form [formula] We denote this hyperplane by P(a;λ) and its intersection with   by SP(a;λ). We first consider the special case SP(I;λ) where [formula].

If λ  ≠  0 then SP(I;λ) is a hyperboloid of one sheet. Also, SP(I;0) is a right circular cone with vertex at the origin in M2.

Consider the following points in P(I;λ):

[formula]

Using the inner product and the induced norm in [formula], we can see that the vectors [formula], [formula], [formula] form an orthonormal system in P(I;λ). We choose O' as the origin and the directed lines joining O' to the points A,B,C as the coordinate axes. We shall refer to the coordinates of a point in P(I;λ) relative to this axes as the Bell-coordinates of the point.

Let the Bell-coordinates of any point Q(x1,x2,x3,x4) in P(I;λ) be (X,Y,Z) so that we have

[formula]

Since [formula], etc., we must have

[formula]

If we substitute the above expressions in the equation defining the space , namely, x1x4 - x2x3 = 0, we get

[formula]

If we consider any set of numbers (X,Y,Z) satisfying Eq.[\eqref=Eq.ii.4.2], then using the relations in Eq.[\eqref=Eq.ii.4.1], we can see that (X,Y,Z) are the Bell-coordinates of a point on SP(I;λ). Therefore Eq.[\eqref=Eq.ii.4.2] is the equation of SP(I;λ) relative to the Bell-axes. When λ  ≠  0, this equation represents a hyperboloid of one sheet (§ 64 [\cite=Bell:60]).

When λ = 0, Eq.[\eqref=Eq.ii.4.2] reduces to X2 + Y2 - Z2 = 0, which represents a right circular cone with vertex at the origin and semi-vertical angle [formula]. Note that this cone lies in the hyperplane P(I;0).

By direct computation or otherwise one can easily see that SP(I;0) is the set of nilpotent elements in M2.

We now explore the relations between the geometrical properties of SP(I;λ) and the algebraic properties of M2. Obviously the center of SP(I;λ) is O' which is a point on the line joining [formula] and [formula]. Since this line is independent of the choice of λ, the centers of the hyperboloids SP(I;λ), for various values of λ, all lie on a fixed line. The axis of rotation of the hyperboloid is given by X = 0, Y = 0. These equations produce a matrix of the form The set of all such elements form a line through the center of the hyperboloid parallel to the line formed by the set of skew-symmetric elements in M2. The asymptotic cone of SP(I;λ) from its center (§ 78[\cite=Bell:60]) is X2 + Y2 - Z2 = 0, which is independent of λ.

From the above discussion we can construct an image of [formula]. If we imagine λ as 'time', [formula] can be thought of as a space generated by the 'moving' hyperboloid SP(I;λ). Initially, that is when λ = 0, we have a degenerate hyperboloid, namely, the right circular cone SP(I;0) with vertex at O and axis the line [formula]. As time advances numerically, the center of the hyperboloid moves along the line [formula]. The axis of rotation of the moving hyperboloid is a line through the center parallel to the axis of the 'initial' hyperboloid. Further, at time λ, the radius of the principal circular section of the hyperboloid is [formula]. Clearly, this increases as λ increases numerically. Thus, the hyperboloid SP(I;λ) expands simultaneously as it moves away from the origin.

The Space of Idempotents

Let E(k) be the set of idempotents of rank k. Obviously, E(0) = {0} and E(2) = {I}. Also, it is easy to see that E(1) = SP(I;1). The next result follows from this.

The space E(1) of idempotents of rank 1 in M2 is a hyperboloid of one sheet.

The generators of E(1) through e turn out to be the sets E(Le) and E(Re). To see this it is enough to show that these sets are lines through e, for if a line lies wholly on a conicoid it must belong to a system of generating lines of the conicoid (§  97 [\cite=Bell:60]). That E(Le) and E(Re) are lines follows from

[formula]

which can be verified by direct computation.

Having found the generating lines on E(1), we next determine how these are organized into two systems of generators as in [\cite=Bell:60]. Let [formula] be the family of all lines of the form E(Le) and [formula], the family of all lines of the form E(Re). Since V is 2-dimensional, no two distinct members of [formula] (or, of [formula]) intersect. Also, every member of [formula] intersects every member (except one) of [formula], and vice versa. Thus [formula] and [formula] are the two families of generating lines of E(1). Though it is not an intrinsic property of E(1), it is interesting to see that members of [formula] are members of the λ-system and those of [formula] are members of the μ-system of generators of E(1) (in the terminology of [\cite=Bell:60]).

The equation of the plane of the principal circular section of SP(I;1) is Z = 0, which is equivalent to x2 = x3, which, in turn, is equivalent to the statement that the element x∈M2 is symmetric. Thus the principal circular section of E(1) consists of the symmetric elements in E(1).

Intersections of [formula] with Arbitrary Hyperplanes

The first thing we notice is that the coordinates (X,Y,Z) of any point on SP(a;λ) relative to some rectangular Cartesian axes in P(a;λ) satisfy a second degree equation. Hence SP(a;λ) is a quadric surface in P(a;λ). The nature of this surface depends, naturally, on a and λ. If λ  ≠  0, then dividing the equation of the plane P(a;λ) by λ, we see that the planes P(a;λ) and [formula] coincide. Hence we need consider only the special surface SP(a;1).

Let a be nonsinguar. If x∈SP(a;1) then [formula] and so ax∈E(1). Hence x∈a- 1E(1). The converse is obvious and so SP(a;1) = a- 1E(1). Since E(1) is a hyperboloid of one sheet and since the map x  ↦  a- 1x is an affine map of P(I;1) onto P(a;1), SP(a;1) must be a hyperboloid of one sheet.

If a is nonsingular SP(a;1) is a hyperboloid of one sheet.

Any regular semigroup S is equipped with a natural partial order [\cite=Namb:80] defined by

[formula]

If a∈M2 is nonsingular then, it can be shown that SP(a;1) is the set of nonzero elements in [formula] which are less than a under the natural partial order in M2.

Let [formula]. If [formula] is an inverse of a then we have axa = a and so ax∈E(1) which implies that x∈SP(a;1). The converse also holds. Thus, if [formula], then SP(a;1) is the set of inverses of a. To understand the geometry of SP(a;1), we consider the special case [formula]. Clearly, x∈P(e;1) if and only if x1 = 1. Let O', A, B, C denote (1,0,0,0), (1,1,0,0), (1,0,1,0) and (1,0,0,1) respectively. Then the vectors [formula], [formula], [formula] form an orthonormal basis in P(e;1). If Q denotes (1,x2,x3,x4) then

[formula]

so that the coordinates (X,Y,Z) of Q relative to this system of axes are X  =  x2, Y = x3, Z = x4. Now x is in SP(e;1) if and only if x1 = 1 and x4 = x2x3 and so SP(e;1) is determined by the cartesian equation XY = Z which is the equation of a hyperbolic paraboloid. This argument can be modified for arbitrary [formula] to yield the following result.

Let a be singular. Then SP(a;1) is the set of inverses of a and is a hyperbolic paraboloid.

We next consider intersections of [formula] with hyperplanes passing through the origin. These are sets of the form SP(a;0). If a is nonsingular then SP(a;0) = a- 1SP(I;0). Since SP(I;0) is a cone with vertex at the origin, SP(a;0) is also a cone. If a is singular and nonzero then using some technical arguments, we can show that [formula] is the union of an [formula]-class and an [formula]-class in , that is, a union of two punctured planes.
