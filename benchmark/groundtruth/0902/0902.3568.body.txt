Introduction

Let A and B be selfadjoint operators in a Hilbert space [formula] and assume that the difference of the resolvents

[formula]

is a trace class operator. Then it is well known that the wave operators W±(B,A) exist; they are isometries mapping the absolutely continuous subspace of A onto that of B. The scattering operator SAB: = W+(B,A)*W-(B,A) of the scattering system {A,B} commutes with A and is unitary on the absolutely continuous subspace of A. Therefore SAB is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator induced by a family of unitary operators [formula] in the spectral representation of the absolutely continuous part of A. The family [formula] is called the scattering matrix of {A,B}.

One of the main objectives of this paper is to represent the scattering matrix of the scattering system {A,B} with the help of an associated Nevanlinna function M(  ·  ). We restrict ourselves to the special case of finite rank perturbations in resolvent sense, i.e., it is assumed that the difference of the resolvents in [\eqref=intdiff] is a rank n operator, where n <   ∞  . In this case the Nevanlinna function M(  ·  ) will be an n  ×  n-matrix function and it will be shown in Theorem [\ref=scattering] that the scattering matrix [formula] is given by

[formula]

for a.e. [formula]. This representation is a generalization of a recent result of the authors from [\cite=BMN06a] and an earlier different (unitarily equivalent) expression found by V.M. Adamyan and B.S. Pavlov in [\cite=AdamP86]. The formula [\eqref=scatint] is obtained by embedding the scattering problem into an extension theoretic framework. More precisely, we consider the (in general nondensely defined) closed symmetric operator [formula] which has finite equal deficiency indices (n,n). The adjoint S* is defined in the sense of linear relations and a so-called boundary triplet [formula] for S* is chosen in such a way that the selfadjoint extensions of S corresponding to the boundary mappings Γ0 and Γ1 coincide with A and B, respectively. The function M(  ·  ) in [\eqref=scatint] is the Weyl function associated to this boundary triplet - an abstract analogon of the classical Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function from singular Sturm-Liouville theory - and contains the spectral information of the operator A.

Besides selfadjoint scattering systems we also consider so-called maximal dissipative scattering systems {A,B}, that is, A is still a selfadjoint operator in [formula] but B is only assumed to be maximal dissipative, i.e., [formula] and the spectrum of B is contained in [formula]. As above we treat only the case of finite rank perturbations in resolvent sense. Following [\cite=BMN06b] [\cite=Pav76] [\cite=Pav96] [\cite=FoiasN70] a minimal selfadjoint dilation L of B in the direct sum [formula] is constructed and a natural larger selfadjoint scattering system {K,L} in [formula] is considered. From Theorem [\ref=scattering] and Theorem [\ref=III.2] we obtain a representation of the scattering matrix [formula] which is closely related to the representations found earlier in [\cite=BMN06b]. We emphasize that the lower right corner of [formula] in Proposition [\ref=sklprop] can be interpreted as the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix [formula] of the Lax-Phillips scattering system {L,D-,D+}, where the incoming and outcoming subspaces D- and D+ are [formula] and [formula], respectively. This also implies the well known relation SLP(λ) = ΘB(λ - i0)* between the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix and the characteristic function ΘB(  ·  ) of the maximal dissipative operator B found by V.M. Adamyan and D.Z. Arov in [\cite=AA65a] [\cite=AA65b] [\cite=AA66a] [\cite=AA66b].

As an application of our approach on finite rank perturbations and maximal dissipative scattering systems we prove an inverse result in Section [\ref=invsec]. Let W(  ·  ) be a purely contractive analytic matrix function on [formula]. Under some mild additional assumptions it is shown in Theorem [\ref=invthm] that the limit [formula] can be regarded as the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix of a suitable chosen Lax-Phillips scattering system. We point out that this statement can be obtained immediately in a more abstract and general form by combining the results of B. Sz.-Nagy and C. Foia= in [\cite=FoiasN70] with the results of V.M. Adamyan and D.Z. Arov in [\cite=AA65a] [\cite=AA65b] [\cite=AA66a] [\cite=AA66b]. However, our approach leads to a more explicit solution of the inverse problem, in particular, we find a maximal dissipative multiplication operator B in an L2-space and a minimal selfadjoint dilation L of B such that the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix of {L,D-,D+} coincides with the limit of the given purely contractive analytic matrix function W(  ·  ); cf. Corollary [\ref=invcor].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=twosec] we give a brief introduction in the theory of boundary triplets for (in general nondensely defined) closed symmetric operators. In particular, we show how a boundary triplet for the intersection [formula] of two selfadjoint operators A and B with a finite dimensional resolvent difference can be chosen. Section [\ref=threesec] is devoted to the representation of the scattering matrix for a scattering system {A,B} with finite rank resolvent difference and in Section [\ref=sec4] the results are extended to the case where the operator B is only maximal dissipative. With the help of these results we propose a solution for the inverse scattering problem in Section [\ref=invsec]. For the convenience of the reader we add an Appendix on direct integrals, spectral representations and scattering matrices.

Notation. The Hilbert spaces in this paper are usually denoted by [formula], [formula] and H; they are all assumed to be separable. The symbols [formula] and [formula] are used for the linear span and closed linear span, respectively, of a set. The algebra of everywhere defined bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space [formula] with values in a Hilbert space [formula] is denoted by

[formula]

if [formula]. By [formula] we denote the subset of

[formula]

Selfadjoint and maximal dissipative extensions of nondensely defined symmetric operators

Linear relations

Let [formula] be a separable Hilbert space. A (closed) linear relation T in [formula] is a (closed) linear subspace of the Cartesian product space [formula]. The set of closed linear relations in [formula] is denoted by [formula]. Linear operators in [formula] will always be identified with linear relations via their graphs. The elements of a linear relation T are pairs denoted by [formula], [formula], and the domain, kernel, range, and the multi-valued part of T are defined as respectively. Note that T is an operator if and only if [formula]. A point λ belongs to the resolvent set ρ(T) of a closed linear relation T if (T - λ)- 1 is an everywhere defined bounded operator in [formula]. The spectrum σ(T) of T is the complement of ρ(T) in [formula].

A linear relation T in [formula] is called dissipative if [formula] holds for all [formula]. A dissipative relation T is said to be maximal dissipative if there exists no proper dissipative extension of T in [formula]. It can be shown that a dissipative relation T is maximal dissipative if and only if [formula] holds.

The adjoint T* of a linear relation T in [formula] is a closed linear relation in [formula] defined by

[formula]

Observe that this definition extends the usual definition of the adjoint operator and that [formula] holds. In particular, T* is an operator if and only if T is densely defined. A linear relation T in [formula] is called symmetric (selfadjoint) if T  ⊂  T* (T = T*, respectively). It follows from the polarization identity that T is symmetric if and only if [formula] for all [formula].

A (possibly nondensely defined) symmetric operator S in [formula] is said to be simple if there is no nontrivial subspace in [formula] which reduces S to a selfadjoint operator. It is well known that every symmetric operator S can be written as the direct orthogonal sum [formula] of a simple symmetric operator Ŝ in the Hilbert space

[formula]

and a selfadjoint operator Ss in [formula].

Boundary triplets for nondensely defined symmetric operators

Let in the following S be a (not necessarily densely defined) closed symmetric operator in the separable Hilbert space [formula] with equal deficiency indices If [formula] is not dense in [formula] the adjoint S* exists only in the sense of linear relations and is defined as in [\eqref=adjrel]. Therefore, if S is not densely defined the closed extensions [formula] of S in [formula] may have nontrivial multi-valued parts. However, the operator S admits also closed extensions in [formula] which are operators. We will use the concept of boundary triplets for the description of the closed extensions [formula] of S in [formula]; see, e.g., [\cite=BGP08] [\cite=DM87a] [\cite=DM91] [\cite=DM95] [\cite=GG91] [\cite=Mal92]. This concept also provides a convenient criterion to check whether [formula] is an operator or not; cf. [\eqref=check].

A triplet Π  =  {H,Γ0,Γ1} is called a boundary triplet for S* if H is a Hilbert space and Γ0,Γ1:S*  →  H are linear mappings such that the abstract Green's identity holds for all [formula], [formula] and the mapping [formula] is surjective.

We refer to [\cite=DM91] [\cite=DM95] [\cite=GG91] [\cite=Mal92] for a detailed study of boundary triplets and recall only some important facts. First of all a boundary triplet Π  =  {H,Γ0,Γ1} for S* exists (but is not unique) since the deficiency indices n±(S) of S are assumed to be equal. Then n±(S)  =   dim H holds. A standard construction of a boundary triplet will be given in the proof of Proposition [\ref=pertupropd].

Let Π  =  {H,Γ0,Γ1} be a boundary triplet for S* and let Ext(S) be the set of all closed extensions [formula] of S. Then S =  ker (Γ) and the mapping

[formula]

establishes a bijective correspondence between the set [formula] of closed linear relations in [formula] and the set of closed extensions SΘ∈Ext(S) of S. We note that the right-hand side of [\eqref=bij] can also be written as ker (Γ1  -  ΘΓ0) where the sum and product is interpreted in the sense of linear relations. Since (SΘ)*  =  SΘ* holds for every [formula] it follows that SΘ is symmetric (selfadjoint) if and only if Θ is symmetric (selfadjoint, respectively). In particular, the extensions A0: =  ker (Γ0) and A1: =  ker (Γ1) are selfadjoint. The selfadjoint operator or relation A0 will often play the role of a fixed selfadjoint extension of S in [formula]. Furthermore, an extension SΘ∈Ext(S) is dissipative (maximal dissipative) if and only if Θ is dissipative (maximal dissipative, respectively). We note that SΘ in [\eqref=bij] is an operator if and only if

[formula]

The following proposition is a consequence of the basic properties of boundary triplets and results from [\cite=DM91] [\cite=DM95] [\cite=Mal92]. Since it plays an important role in this paper we give a complete proof for the convenience of the reader. We also note that the statement remains true if A and B are linear relations instead of operators. Recall that [formula], [formula], is the set of finite dimensional operators in [formula] with ranges of dimension n, i.e.,

Let A be a selfadjoint operator and let B be a maximal dissipative operator in [formula]. Assume that holds for some (and hence for all) [formula]. Then the closed symmetric operator [formula] has finite deficiency indices (n,n) in [formula] and there exists a boundary triplet [formula] for S* and a dissipative n  ×  n-matrix D such that A =  ker (Γ0) and B =  ker (Γ1 - DΓ0) holds.

Let [formula] and let [formula], [formula] and [formula] be linearly independent vectors such that

[formula]

The operator [formula], that is, is a (in general non-densely defined) symmetric operator in [formula] and it is easy to check that

[formula]

holds. The intersection in [\eqref=ressab] is understood in the sense of linear relations. Hence [\eqref=pertu] and [\eqref=ressab] imply [formula]. Therefore dim (A / S) = n and S has deficiency indices (n,n). Note that (S - λ0)- 1 is defined on the subspace [formula] which has codimension n in [formula].

It is not difficult to verify that S* coincides with the direct sum of the subspaces A and Let us decompose the elements ∈S* accordingly, i.e.,

[formula]

and denote by P0 the orthogonal projection onto the closed subspace Nλ0. Then Π  =  {Nλ0,Γ0,Γ1}, where ∈S*, is a boundary triplet with A = A0: =  ker (Γ0). In fact, for [formula] as in [\eqref=decfhat] and [formula] we obtain from (AfA,gA) = (fA,AgA) that holds. The surjectivity of the mapping [formula] follows from λ̄0∈ρ(A) since for [formula] we can choose [formula] such that [formula] holds. Then obviously : = {fA + x,AfA  +  λ0x} satisfies [formula]. Moreover, from the definition of Γ0 we immediately obtain that the extension A0  =   ker (Γ0) coincides with the operator A. As the deficiency indices of S are (n,n) we can identify Nλ0 with [formula].

Since B is a maximal dissipative extension of the symmetric operator S, B∈Ext(S). Hence [formula] and the linear relation is maximal dissipative in [formula] and B coincides with the maximal dissipative extension SD via [\eqref=bij]. We claim that D is a matrix, i.e., [formula]. In fact, assume that D is multi-valued, that is, there exists   =  {f,Bf}∈B such that {0,Γ1}∈D with [formula]. In particular, Γ0 = 0, i.e., ∈A0 = A and therefore [formula], however, this is a contradiction. Thus D is a dissipative n  ×  n-matrix and it follows from [\eqref=bij] that B =  ker (Γ1 - DΓ0) holds.

Weyl functions and Krein's formula

Again let S be a (in general nondensely defined) closed symmetric operator in [formula] with equal deficiency indices as in the previous section. If [formula] is a point of regular type of S, i.e., (S - λ)- 1 is a bounded operator, we denote the defect subspace of S at λ by [formula] and we agree to write Let Π  =  {H,Γ0,Γ1} be a boundary triplet for S* and let A0  =   ker (Γ0) be the fixed selfadjoint extension of S. Recall that for every λ∈ρ(A0) the relation S* is the direct sum of the selfadjoint relation A0 and λ and denote by π1 the orthogonal projection onto the first component of [formula]. The operator valued functions and are called the γ-field and the Weyl function, respectively, corresponding to the boundary triplet Π  =  {H,Γ0,Γ1}; see, e.g., [\cite=DM87a] [\cite=DM91] [\cite=DM95] [\cite=Mal92]. It can be shown that both γ(  ·  ) and M(  ·  ) are holomorphic on ρ(A0) and that the identities

[formula]

and

[formula]

are valid; see [\cite=DM91] [\cite=Mal92]. The identity [\eqref=mlambda] yields that M(  ·  ) is a

[formula]

A representation of the scattering matrix

In this section we consider scattering systems {A,B} consisting of two selfadjoint operators A and B in a separable Hilbert space [formula] and we assume that the difference of the resolvents of A and B is a finite rank operator, that is, for some [formula] we have

[formula]

for one (and hence for all) [formula]. Then the wave operators exist and are complete, where Pac(A) denotes the orthogonal projection onto the absolutely continuous subspace [formula] of A. Completeness means that the ranges of W±(B,A) coincide with the absolutely continuous subspace [formula] of B; cf. [\cite=BW83] [\cite=Ka76] [\cite=Wei03] [\cite=Yaf92]. The scattering operator SAB of the scattering system {A,B} is defined by Since the scattering operator commutes with A it follows that SAB is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator induced by a family [formula] of unitary operators in a spectral representation of [formula]. The aim of this section is to generalize a representation result of this so-called scattering matrix [formula] from [\cite=BMN06a].

According to [\eqref=finite] and Corollary [\ref=pertuprop] the (possibly nondensely defined) closed symmetric operator [formula] has deficiency indices (n,n) and there exists a boundary triplet [formula] for S* such that A  =   ker (Γ0) and B  =   ker (Γ1). The Weyl function M(  ·  ) corresponding to the boundary triplet Π is a

[formula]

-valued Nevanlinna function. Hence it follows that the limit lim ε  →  0 +M(λ + iε)- 1 exists for a.e. [formula] and coincides with the inverse of M(λ) in [\eqref=mlim] for a.e. [formula].

In the following theorem we find a representation of the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {A,B} in the direct integral [formula], where

[formula]

cf. Appendix A. We will formulate and prove our result first for the case of a simple symmetric operator [formula] and discuss the general case afterwards in Theorem [\ref=III.2]. For the special case that the simple symmetric operator [formula] is densely defined Theorem [\ref=scattering] reduces to [\cite=BMN06a]. We remark that the proof of Theorem [\ref=scattering] differs from the proof of [\cite=BMN06a]. Here we make use of the abstract representation result Theorem [\ref=A.II].

Let A and B be selfadjoint operators in [formula] such that [\eqref=finite] is satisfied, suppose that the symmetric operator [formula] is simple and let [formula] be a boundary triplet for S* such that A =  ker (Γ0) and B =  ker (Γ1); cf. Corollary [\ref=pertuprop]. Let M(  ·  ) be the corresponding Weyl function and define the spaces [formula] for a.e. [formula] as in [\eqref=hlambda].

Then [formula] performs a spectral representation of Aac such that the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {A,B} admits the representation

[formula]

for a.e. [formula], where M(λ) = M(λ  +  i0).

In order to verify the representation [\eqref=scatformula] of the scattering matrix [formula] we will make use of Theorem [\ref=A.II]. For this let us first rewrite the difference of the resolvents (B - i)- 1 and (A  -  i)- 1 as in [\eqref=A.5]. According to Corollary [\ref=pertuprop] we have

[formula]

Using [\eqref=gammamu] we find and hence the representation [\eqref=A.5] follows if we set

[formula]

Moreover, since S is simple it follows from [\eqref=simpl] that holds. As [formula] one concludes in the same way as in the proof of [\cite=BMN06a] that the condition is satisfied.

Next we express the

[formula]

In general it may happen that the operator [formula] is not simple, that is, there is a nontrivial decomposition of the Hilbert space [formula] such that

[formula]

where [formula] is simple symmetric operator in [formula] and H is a selfadjoint operator in [formula], cf. Section [\ref=linrel]. Then there exist selfadjoint extensions Â and B̂ of Ŝ in [formula] such that

[formula]

The next result extends the representation of the scattering matrix in Theorem [\ref=scattering] to the case of a non-simple S.

Let A and B be selfadjoint operators in [formula] such that [\eqref=finite] is satisfied, let [formula] be decomposed as in [\eqref=simsim] and let [formula] be a boundary triplet for S* such that A =  ker (Γ0) and B =  ker (Γ1); cf. Corollary [\ref=pertuprop]. Furthermore, let [formula] be a spectral representation of the absolutely continuous part Hac of the selfadjoint operator H in the Hilbert space [formula].

Then [formula] is a spectral representation of Aac and the scattering matrix [formula] is given by for a.e. [formula], where [formula], M(  ·  ) is the Weyl function corresponding to the boundary triplet Π and is the scattering matrix of the scattering system {Â,B̂} from [\eqref=abdeco].

It follows from the decomposition [\eqref=abdeco] that the absolutely continuous subspaces [formula] and [formula] can be written as the orthogonal sums of the absolutely continuous subspaces of Â and B̂, and the absolutely continuous subspace [formula] of the selfadjoint operator H in [formula]. Therefore the wave operators of W±(B,A) of the scattering system {A,B} can be written with the wave operators [formula] of the scattering system [formula] in the form This implies the corresponding decomposition of the scattering operator SAB in [formula] and hence the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {A,B} coincides with the orthogonal sum of the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {Â,B̂} and the identity operator in the spectral representation [formula] of Hac.

It is not difficult to see that [formula], where 0 and 1 denote the restrictions of the boundary mappings Γ0 and Γ1 from [formula] onto (Ŝ)*, is a boundary triplet for (Ŝ)* such that Â  =   ker (0) and B̂  =   ker (1). Moreover, the Weyl function corresponding to Π̂ coincides with the Weyl function M(  ·  ) corresponding to Π. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=scattering] the scattering matrix [formula] is given by [\eqref=scatformula].

Dissipative and Lax-Phillips scattering systems

In this section we consider a scattering systems {A,B} consisting of a selfadjoint operator A and a maximal dissipative operator B in the Hilbert space [formula]. As above it is assumed that

[formula]

holds for some [formula]. Then the closed symmetric operator [formula] is in general not densely defined and its deficiency indices are (n,n). By Corollary [\ref=pertupropcor] there exists a boundary triplet [formula] for S* and a dissipative n  ×  n-matrix D such that A =  ker (Γ0), B =  ker (Γ1 - DΓ0) and holds. For our later purposes in Section [\ref=invsec] it is sufficient to investigate the special case [formula], the general case can be treated in the same way as in [\cite=BMN06b] [\cite=BMN08a].

For the investigation of the dissipative scattering system {A,B} it is useful to construct a so-called minimal selfadjoint dilation L of the maximal dissipative operator B. For the explicit construction of L we will use the following lemma which also shows how the constant function [formula], [formula], can be realized as a Weyl function. A detailed proof of Lemma [\ref=glem] can be found in [\cite=BMN06b].

Let T be the first order differential operator in the Hilbert space [formula] defined by Then the following holds.

T is a densely defined closed simple symmetric operator with deficiency indices (n,n).

The adjoint operator is

The triplet [formula], where is a boundary triplet for T* and T0  =   ker (Υ0) is the selfadjoint first order differential operator in [formula] defined on [formula].

The Weyl function τ(  ·  ) corresponding to the boundary triplet [formula] is given by

Let [formula] and let T be the first order differential operator from Lemma [\ref=glem]. It is clear that

[formula]

is a closed symmetric operator in the Hilbert space [formula] with deficiency indices (2n,2n) and the adjoint of [\eqref=ortsum] is the orthogonal sum of the relation S* and the operator T* from Lemma [\ref=glem]. The next theorem, which is a variant of [\cite=BMN06b], shows how a minimal selfadjoint dilation of the dissipative operator B =  ker (Γ1 - DΓ0) can be constructed. For the particular case of Sturm-Liouville operators with dissipative boundary conditions this construction goes back to B.S. Pavlov; cf. [\cite=Pav76] [\cite=Pav96].

Let A be a selfadjoint operator and let B be a maximal dissipative operator in [formula] such that [\eqref=4.1] holds. Let [formula] be a boundary triplet for S*, [formula], and let D be a dissipative n  ×  n-matrix with [formula] such that A =  ker (Γ0) and B =  ker (Γ1 - DΓ0); cf. Proposition [\ref=pertupropd]. If [formula] is the boundary triplet of T* introduced in Lemma [\ref=glem], then the operator with domain is a minimal selfadjoint dilation of the maximal dissipative operator B, that is, for all [formula] holds and the condition [formula] is satisfied.

Besides the assertion that L is an operator the proof of Theorem [\ref=dilthm] is essentially the same as the proof of [\cite=BMN06b]. The fact that the restriction L of the relation [formula] is an operator can be seen as follows: Suppose that [formula], where [formula], [formula]. Since T* is an operator we have [formula] and this implies ĝ = 0. Therefore we obtain from the boundary conditions in [formula] that holds. Hence [formula] belongs to A =  ker (Γ0) which is an operator. Therefore [formula] and L is an operator.

Let L be the minimal selfadjoint dilation of the maximal dissipative operator B from Theorem [\ref=dilthm] and define a selfadjoint operator K in [formula] by

[formula]

where T0  =   ker (Υ0) is the selfadjoint first order differential operator from Lemma [\ref=glem]. In the following theorem we consider the scattering system {K,L} in the Hilbert space [formula]. The operator [formula] is symmetric and may have a nontrivial selfadjoint part H which acts in the Hilbert space Hence the operators K and L admit the decompositions with selfadjoint operators [formula] and [formula] in [formula] and we have [formula], where [formula]. In particular, [formula] and [formula] are both selfadjoint extensions of the closed simple symmetric operator [formula]. We remark that the symmetric operator R is an n-dimensional extension of the orthogonal sum in [\eqref=ortsum]; this follows easily from the next theorem. In the following we assume that [formula] is a spectral representation of the absolutely continuous part Hac of H.

Let A be a selfadjoint operator and let B be a maximal dissipative operator in [formula] such that [\eqref=4.1] holds. Let [formula] be a boundary triplet for S*, [formula], and let D be a dissipative n  ×  n-matrix with [formula] such that A =  ker (Γ0) and B =  ker (Γ1 - DΓ0); cf. Proposition [\ref=pertupropd]. If L is the minimal self-adjoint dilation of B in Theorem [\ref=dilthm] and K is given by [\eqref=l], then

[formula]

Moreover, if [formula] is a spectral representation of Hac, where H is the maximal self-adjoint part of [formula], then [formula] is a spectral representation of K and the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {K,L} admits the representation for a.e. [formula], where is the scattering matrix of the scattering system {,L̂}, M(  ·  ) is the Weyl function of the boundary triplet Π and M(λ) = M(λ + i0).

We are going to apply Theorem [\ref=III.2] to the scattering system {K,L}. For this we consider the symmetric operator [formula] and note that the operator K is given by [formula]. Hence the boundary condition Γ0  -  Υ0ĝ = 0 in [formula] is automatically fulfilled and this implies that the intersection [formula] given by where   =  {f,Af} and ĝ  =  {g,T0g}. It is not difficult to verify that the adjoint operator R* has the form and [formula], where is a boundary triplet for R*. Observe that [formula] and [formula]. This also implies that the difference of the resolvents of K and L in [\eqref=klresdiff] is a rank n operator; cf. Corollary [\ref=pertuprop].

Let us compute the Weyl function [formula] corresponding to the boundary triplet [formula]. For [formula] and [formula] we have ∈λ,S*, ĝ∈λ,T* and Γ0  =  Υ0ĝ. Hence the definition of the Weyl function and Lemma [\ref=glem] imply and therefore [formula] for [formula]. As D is a dissipative matrix and [formula] by assumption it follows that

[formula]

is uniformly positive and hence [formula]. Now Theorem [\ref=III.2] applied to the boundary triplet [formula] and the corresponding Weyl function [formula] yields the statement of Theorem [\ref=couplescat].

For our later purposes it is useful to express the scattering matrix [formula] in Theorem [\ref=couplescat] in a slightly different form. The following proposition extends [\cite=BMN06b] to the case where [formula] is not necessarily densely defined. The proof is almost the same and will not be repeated.

Let the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=couplescat] be satisfied, assume, in addition, that [formula] is simple and let [formula], [formula], M(λ): = M(λ + i0), be a spectral representation of Aac.

Then [formula] is a spectral representation of [formula] such that the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {K,L} can be expressed by for a.e. [formula], where

If [formula] is simple we find by combining Theorem [\ref=couplescat] with Proposition [\ref=sklprop] that [formula] holds for a.e. [formula], i.e., the spectral multiplicity of Hac, where H is the maximal self-adjoint part of [formula] is equal to the spectral multiplicity of Aac.

In the following we are going to interpret the right lower corner I + 2iS22 of the scattering matrix [formula] in Proposition [\ref=sklprop] as the scattering matrix corresponding to a Lax-Phillips scattering system; see, e.g., [\cite=BW83] [\cite=LP67] for further details. For this purpose we decompose [formula] into the orthogonal sum of the subspaces and denote the natural embeddings of D± into [formula] by J±. The subspaces D+ and D- are called outgoing and incoming subspaces, respectively, for the selfadjoint dilation L in [formula], i.e. hold. The system {L,D-,D+} is called Lax-Phillips scattering system and the corresponding Lax-Phillips wave operators are defined by cf. [\cite=BW83]. Since [formula] the restrictions of the wave operators W±(L,K) of the scattering system {K,L} onto [formula] coincide with the Lax-Phillips wave operators Ω± and hence the Lax-Phillips scattering operator SLP: = Ω*+Ω- is given by SLP  =  PL2SKL  ιL2, where SKL is the scattering operator of the scattering system {K,L}, PL2 is the orthogonal projection from [formula] onto [formula] and ιL2 denotes the canonical embedding. Hence the Lax-Phillips scattering operator SLP is a contraction in [formula] and commutes with the selfadjoint differential operator T0. Therefore SLP is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator induced by a family [formula] of contractive operators in [formula]; this family is called the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix.

The above considerations together with Proposition [\ref=sklprop] immediately imply the following corollary on the representation of the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix; cf. [\cite=BMN06b].

Let the assumptions of Proposition [\ref=sklprop] be satisfied. If {L,D-,D+} is the Lax-Phillips scattering system from above, then the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix [formula] admits the representation for a.e. [formula], where M(λ) = M(λ + i0).

We mention that Corollary [\ref=lax1] also implies a well-known result of Adamyan and Arov in [\cite=AA65a] [\cite=AA65b] [\cite=AA66a] [\cite=AA66b] on the relation of the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix with the characteristic function of the maximal dissipative operator B; see [\cite=BMN06b] for further details.

An inverse scattering problem

Let [formula] be a contractive analytic matrix function defined on the upper half-plane [formula]. Then the limit exists for a.e. [formula]. In the following theorem we show that under some mild additional conditions the limit of the function W can be regarded as the scattering matrix of a Lax-Phillips scattering system {L,D-,D+}, where L is the minimal selfadjoint dilation of some maximal dissipative operator in a Hilbert space [formula] as in the previous section.

Let [formula] be a contractive analytic function such that the conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

are satisfied. Then the following holds:

There exists a separable Hilbert space [formula], a (in general nondensely defined) simple symmetric operator S with deficiency indices (n,n) in [formula], a boundary triplet [formula] for S* with Weyl function M(  ·  ) and a dissipative matrix D∈[null] with [formula] such that W(  ·  ) admits the representation

[formula]

for all [formula] and a.e. [formula], where W(μ) = W(μ + i0) and M(μ) = M(μ + i0).

The function [formula] is the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix of the Lax-Phillips scattering system {L,D-,D+}, where L is the minimal selfadjoint dilation of the maximal dissipative extension B  =   ker (Γ1  -  DΓ0) of S in Theorem [\ref=dilthm] and the incoming and outgoing subspaces are [formula].

If, in addition, the condition

[formula]

holds for all h∈H, [formula], then the symmetric operator S is densely defined.

If W(  ·  ) is an inner function, i.e. W(μ  +  i0) is unitary for a.e. [formula], then the spectrum of the selfadjoint operator A  =   ker (Γ0) is purely singular and the absolutely continuous part Aac of A is trivial.

(i) Observe that condition [\eqref=5.2] together with ||W(η)||  ≤  1 implies that ker (I - W(η)) = {0} holds for all [formula]. Indeed, for x∈ ker (I - W(η)) we have ||W(η)x||  =  ||x|| and hence which yields x  =  0. We define a function [formula] by

[formula]

and we extend M to the lower half-plane by [formula]. Then M is analytic and a straightforward computation shows

[formula]

for [formula]. Hence M is a Nevanlinna function and condition [\eqref=5.2] implies [formula]. From condition [\eqref=5.3] we obtain By Theorem [\ref=nevweyl] there exists a separable Hilbert space [formula], a (in general nondensely defined) simple symmetric operator S with deficiency indices (n,n) and a boundary triplet [formula] for S* such that M is the corresponding Weyl function. For [formula] we have

[formula]

Setting D: =  - iI we have [formula] and hence the representation [\eqref=repw] follows from [\eqref=5.7]. (ii) From Corollary [\ref=lax1] one immediately gets that W can be regarded as the Lax-Phillips scattering matrix of the Lax-Phillips scattering system {L,D-,D+}. (iii) Making use of [\eqref=5.5a] one easily verifies that the condition [\eqref=5.5] yields Hence the operator S is densely defined by Theorem [\ref=nevweyl]. (iv) We consider the analytic function w(η): =  det (I  -  W(η)), [formula]. Since the limit W(λ  +  i0): =  lim y  →   + 0W(λ  +  iy) exists for a.e. [formula] the limit w(λ  +  i0): =  lim y  →   + 0w(λ  +  iy) exist for a.e. [formula], too. If the Lebesgue measure of the set [formula] is different from zero, then [formula] for all [formula] by the Lusin-Privalov theorem [\cite=Koo80] but this is impossible by assumption [\eqref=5.2], cf. proof of (i). Hence, the set [formula] has Lebesgue measure zero. Therefore, the operator (I  -  W(λ  +  i0))- 1 exist for a.e. [formula]. Using [\eqref=5.5a] we find that [formula] for a.e. [formula]. By [\cite=BMN02] we get that the selfadjoint operator A  =   ker (Γ0) has no absolutely continuous spectrum, i.e., the absolutely continuous part of A is trivial.

We remark, that the representation [\eqref=repw] can also be obtained from [\cite=DM95]. In fact, in the special case considered here some parts of the proof of Theorem [\ref=invthm] (i) coincide with the proof of [\cite=DM95].

The Lax-Phillips scattering system and the selfadjoint dilation L in Theorem [\ref=invthm] can be made more explicit. Let [formula] be as in the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=invthm] and define the function M by and M(η) = M()* as in [\eqref=mfct]. Then M is

[formula]

-valued nondecreasing symmetric matrix function on [formula] such that [formula]. We note that due to condition (ii) in Theorem [\ref=invthm] the linear term in the integral representation [\eqref=intrep] is absent. Let [formula] be the Hilbert space of [formula]-valued functions as in [\cite=Berez68] [\cite=GG91] [\cite=Mal-Mal03]. It was shown in [\cite=Mal-Mal03] that the mapping

[formula]

defined originally on the space [formula] of (strongly) continuous functions with compact support admits a continuous extension to an operator from [formula] into [formula]. According to [\cite=DM95] [\cite=Mal-Mal03] the adjoint of the (in general nondensely defined) closed symmetric operator is given by the linear relation and that [formula], where   =  {f(t) + t(1 + t2)- 1h,tf(t) - (1 + t2)- 1h}∈S*, is a boundary triplet for S* with corresponding Weyl function M(  ·  ). Note that here A0  =   ker (Γ0) is the usual maximal multiplication operator in [formula].

Let [formula] be a contractive analytic function which satisfies the conditions [\eqref=5.2] and [\eqref=5.3] in Theorem [\ref=invthm]. Then there exists a symmetric matrix α∈[null] and a

[formula]

Spectral representations and scattering matrix

Let A be a selfadjoint operator in the separable Hilbert space [formula] and let E(  ·  ) be the corresponding spectral measure defined on the σ-algebra [formula] of Borel subsets of [formula]. The absolutely continuous and singular part of the measure E(  ·  ) is denoted by Eac(  ·  ) and Es(  ·  ), respectively. If C∈[null] is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator, then by [\cite=BW83] is a trace class valued measure on [formula] of finite variation. This measure admits a unique decomposition into a singular measure Σs(  ·  )  =  C*Es(  ·  )C and an absolutely continuous measure Σac(  ·  )  =  C*Eac(  ·  )C. According to [\cite=BW83] the trace class valued function λ  ↦  Σ(λ): = C*E(( -   ∞  ,λ))C admits a derivative [formula] in the trace class norm for a.e. [formula] with respect to the Lebesgue measure dλ and holds. By [formula] we define a measurable family of subspaces in H. Let P(λ) be the orthogonal projection from H onto [formula] and define a measurable family of projections by Then P is an orthogonal projection in [formula] and we denote the range of P by [formula]. In the following we regard [formula] as the direct integral of the measurable family of subspaces [formula].

Let A, E, C and K(λ) be as above and assume that the absolutely continuous subspace [formula] satisfies the condition

[formula]

Then the linear extension of the mapping

[formula]

onto the dense subspace [formula] of [formula] admits a unique continuation to an isometric isomorphism from [formula] such that

[formula]

holds for any [formula].

For f∈H and [formula] we have and hence the extension of the mapping [\eqref=specmap] onto the subspace [formula] is an isometry into [formula]. Then the unique extension [formula] is isometric and it remains to show that Φ is onto. Suppose that there exists [formula] such that holds for all [formula] and f∈H. This implies [formula] for a.e. [formula] and hence [formula] for a.e. [formula], thus h(λ)  =  0 for a.e. [formula]. Hence Φ is surjective. The relation [\eqref=A.1] for Φ follows from [\eqref=specmap].

From [\eqref=A.1] we immediately get that the maximal multiplication operator Q in [formula],

[formula]

satisfies QΦ  =  ΦAac and φ(Q)Φ  =  Φφ(Aac) for any bounded Borel measurable function [formula]. In other words, the direct integral [formula] performs a spectral representation of the absolutely continuous part Aac of the selfadjoint operator A.

Suppose now that B is also a selfadjoint operator in [formula] and assume that the difference of the resolvents is a trace class operator. Then the wave operators exists and are complete; cf., e.g., [\cite=BW83]. The scattering operator SAB: = W+(B,A)*W-(B,A) regarded as an operator in [formula] is unitary and commutes with A. Therefore there is a measurable family [formula] of unitary operators SAB(λ)∈[null] such that SAB is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operator SAB induced by [formula] in [formula], that is, SAB  =  ΦSABΦ- 1. The measurable family [formula] is called the scattering matrix of the scattering system {A,B}.

The following theorem on the representation of the scattering matrix is an important ingredient in the proof of Theorem [\ref=scattering]. A detailed proof of Theorem [\ref=A.II] will appear in a forthcoming paper.

Let A and B be selfadjoint operators in the separable Hilbert space [formula] and suppose that the resolvent difference admits the factorization where C∈[null] is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator, G∈[null], [formula] is a bounded continuous function and Q  =  φ(A)CG. Assume that the condition

[formula]

is satisfied and let [formula] and [formula] for a.e. [formula].

Then [formula] is a spectral representation of Aac and the scattering matrix [formula] of the scattering system {A,B} has the representation

[formula]

for a.e. [formula], where

[formula]

and the limit QB(λ + i0): =  lim ε  →   + 0Q*(B - λ - iε)- 1Q is taken in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm.
