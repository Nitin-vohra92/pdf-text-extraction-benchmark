Cyclicity of Lusztig's stratification of Grassmannians and Poisson geometry

Introduction

For the purpose of the study of canonical bases, Lusztig defined [\cite=L] the totally nonnegative part (G / P)≥  0 of an arbitrary complex flag variety G / P. He also constructed an algebro-geometric stratification of G / P and conjectured that intersecting this stratification with (G / P)≥  0 is producing a cell decomposition of (G / P)≥  0. This was latter proved by Rietsch in [\cite=R]. Both the non-negative part (G / P)≥  0 and the Lusztig stratification of a flag variety were studied in recent years from many different combinatorial and Lie theoretic points of view.

In a recent work Knutson, Lam, and Speyer proved that the Lusztig stratification of the Grassmannian [formula] has a remarkable cyclicity property. If c denotes the Coxeter element [formula] of Sn and the permutation matrix in [formula] which represents it, then c permutes the strata of the Lusztig stratification of [formula].

In this note we give a Poisson geometric proof of this fact. We also prove a stronger invariance property of a Poisson structure on [formula]. In [\cite=GY], jointly with Goodearl, we found a Poisson geometric interpretation of the Lusztig stratification of any flag variety G / P. For a choice of opposite Borel subgroups B and B- of G such that B  ⊂  P one defines the standard Poisson structure πG / P on G / P which is invariant under the action of the maximal torus [formula], see [\cite=GY] for details. According to [\cite=GY] the T-orbits of symplectic leaves of πG / P are exactly the Lusztig strata.

In the case of the complex Grassmannian [formula] the standard Poisson structure is given by

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the induced infinitesimal action from the left action of [formula] on [formula] and Eij denote the elementary matrices. This Poisson structure is invariant under the action of the maximal torus Tn of diagonal matrices in [formula]. For each w∈Sn denote by the same letter the corresponding permutation matrix in [formula]. As before c denotes the permutation matrix corresponding to the Coxeter element [formula]. The main result of this paper is:

Multiplication by c is a Poisson automorphism of [formula] πk,n).

It is well known that the action of the permutation matrix [formula] corresponding to the longest element of Sn is an anti-Poisson automorphism, see Section 2 for details. Thus Theorem [\ref=tinv] implies:

The actions of [formula], c, and Tn generate an action of [formula] by Poisson and anti-Poisson automorphisms of [formula] where I2(n) denotes the dihedral group of order 2n.

The Lusztig stratification of the Grassmannian [formula] is defined as follows, see [\cite=L] for details. Let B and B- be the standard Borel subgroups of [formula] consisting of upper and lower triangular matrices. Denote the maximal parabolic subgroup

[formula]

of [formula] and the induced map

[formula]

The strata in the Lusztig stratification of [formula] are given by

[formula]

Here ≤   refers to the Bruhat order. We denote by Sk  ×  Sn - k the subgroup of Sn consisting of of those u∈Sn such that u(i)  ≤  k for i  ≤  k and u(i)  ≥  k + 1 for i  ≥  k + 1. Finally, [formula] denotes the set of maximal length representatives for the cosets Sn / (Sk  ×  Sn - k)

The symplectic foliation of a Poisson structure is uniquely determined by it. Thus the Tn-orbits of leaves of πk,n (which are exactly the Lusztig strata) are an invariant of the pair (πk,n, Tn-action). Therefore Theorem [\ref=tinv] gives a second proof of the result of Knutson, Lam, and Speyer that the action of the Coxeter element c on [formula] interchanges the Lusztig strata. In fact Theorem [\ref=tinv] is equivalent to the stronger statement:

Finally we trace the roots of this phenomenon from a Poisson geometric point of view. It is well known that on any flag variety G / P the standard Poisson structure πG / P is anti-invariant under the action of any representative [formula] of the longest element of the Weyl group W of G. If, in addition, P is cominuscule, then [\cite=GY] implies that the standard Poisson structure on G / P is anti-invariant under the action of any representative [formula] of the longest element of the corresponding parabolic subgroup of W. In the special case of the Grassmannian the specific Coxeter element c happens to be a k-th root of [formula]. Thus Theorem [\ref=tinv] claiming that the standard Poisson structure on [formula] is invariant under c is a strengthening of [\cite=GY]. See Section 2 for more details. We do not know of good Poisson properties of roots of [formula] for any other cominuscule flag varieties. Acknowledgements.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=tinv]

The statement is equivalent to showing that

[formula]

that is

[formula]

We will check this on the open Schubert cell B-  ·  Pk,n  ⊂  Gr(k,n). Since V is an algebraic bivector field, this will establish [\eqref=eq]. Identify

[formula]

where Mn - k,k denotes the space of (n - k)  ×  k complex matrices. Applying [\cite=BGY] we get that under [\eqref=ident]

[formula]

It is obvious that

[formula]

Let 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k. Then

[formula]

which implies that under [\eqref=ident]

[formula]

The summation in [\eqref=eq] can be taken from i = 1 since [formula]. Applying [\eqref=eq1], [\eqref=eq2], and [\eqref=eq3] we obtain that under the identification [\eqref=ident]

[formula]

This implies [\eqref=eq] and the statement of the Theorem.

For an arbitrary complex simple group G and a maximal parabolic subgroup P, one defines the standard Poisson structure

[formula]

on the flag variety G / P induced from a compatible triangular decomposition of G (a pair of Borel subgroups B and B-, such that [formula] is a maximal torus of G and B  ⊂  P), see e.g. [\cite=GY]. Here [formula] denotes the induced action from the infinitesimal action of [formula]. The standard r-matrix [formula] obtained from the triangular decomposition of G is given by:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are appropriately normalized root vectors of [formula] and Δ+ is the set of positive roots of G, cf. [\cite=GY]. It is obvious that the action of any representative [formula] of the longest element of the Weyl group W of G on (G / P,πG / P) is anti-Poisson, since [formula] interchanges [formula] and [formula].

Denote the Levi factor of P containing T by L, and the longest element of the subgroup of W corresponding to L by [formula]. Let [formula] be any representative of [formula] in the normalizer of T.

Recall that among several equivalent definitions/characterizations of cominuscule parabolic subgroups: a parabolic subgroup P of G is cominuscule if and only if its unipotent radical is abelian. According to [\cite=GY], if P cominuscule, then πG / P is also given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the standard r-matrix of L. Thus the action of [formula] on (G / P,πG / P) is anti-Poisson as well. So:

For any cominuscule parabolic subgroup P of a complex simple Lie group G, the action of [formula] on (G / P,πG / P) is Poisson.

In the special case of the Grassmannian [formula]

[formula]

for the particular Coxeter element c. Taking powers of this product, we see that the action of cgcd(k,n) on [formula] is Poisson. In the case when k and n are relatively prime this gives yet another proof of Theorem [\ref=tinv]. One could argue that Theorem [\ref=tinv] holds because it is true for relatively prime k and n, and its statement (cf. also its proof) is independent of the numerical properties of k and n.

Conceptually the invariance of πk,n under c is the result of a two step process:

1. From Proposition [\ref=p1] one has the invariance of πG / P under the product [formula] of the longest elements of the Weyl groups of G and the Levi subgroup L, for arbitrary cominuscule flag variety G / P.

2. In the case of the Grassmannian the Coxeter element c which is a k-th root of [formula] acts by Poisson automorphisms of [formula] as well.

The special property of the Coxeter element [formula] is that the other Coxeter elements of Sn are not roots of [formula].

The symplectic foliation of a Poisson manifold (M,π) is an invariant of it. Similarly if a group H act on (M,π) by Poisson automorphisms the partition of M into H-orbits of symplectic leaves is an invariant of (M,π) considered as a Poisson H-space. Since the partition of [formula] into Tn-orbits of symplectic leaves of [formula] is exactly the Lusztig stratification of [formula] due to [\cite=GY] and c normalizes Tn, Theorem [\ref=tinv] implies the following Theorem of Knutson, Lam, and Speyer:

The action of the permutation matrix corresponding to the Coxeter element [formula] on [formula] permutes the strata [formula] of the Lusztig stratification.

As we pointed out, in addition, when c maps one Lusztig stratum Rv1,w1 to another Rv2,w2, it matches the regular Poisson structures πk,n|Rv1,w1 and πk,n|Rv2,w2.

Finally let us point out that all constructions and invariance properties are valid over the reals since all constructions are derived from the real split form [formula].
