Broken Defects

ABSTRACT. Recent indications of a neutrino mass raise the possibility that the dark matter may be hot, which would be a severe challenge for structure formation theory. We argue that generic defect theories fare very well in hot dark matter cosmologies, and also work in the presence of curvature or a cosmological constant. If this model is correct, then the MAP and PLANCK missions will not measure what people expect them to (oscillations); rather, they will measure a broad hump.

The traditional class of scale invariant defect models has severe problems[\cite=watson97] [\cite=pst97]. They do not explain the rise in fluctuation amplitude at scales of a few degrees, and the slope of the perturbations is at conflict with the observed matter power spectrum. We show here that global topological defects generically change behaviour at the matter-radiation transition at a cosmic age of 100000 years. In this case, instead of being at great discrepancy with the cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuations, this model in fact correctly explains several hitherto mysterious phenomena. Recent measurements have indicated that neutrinos have mass, and have opened up that the dark matter may be massive neutrinos. If we accept that neutrinos have mass, we have the potential consequence that neutrinos account for all the dark mass in the universe. This simple scenario is consistent with the simplest massive neutrino extensions of the standard particle physics models[\cite=georgi], and challenges cosmologists to contemplate its implications for structure formation. The scale invariant adiabatic model predicted by inflation is not consistent if massive neutrinos account for the bulk of gravitating matter. We will show that generic defect models would now become the best physically based model of structure formation. The most recent supernovae search[\cite=science] [\cite=perlmutter], concordance arguments[\cite=oststei] and direct angular diameter distance measurements[\cite=danos] have suggested that the universe is filled with a cosmological constant. This further challenges hot dark matter (HDM) structure formation models, but will turn out to be simple to reconcile in defect models.

Let us now address the dynamics of global defects at matter-radiation equality. In modern particle physics, all interactions which are not forbidden actually occur. On this ground, one generically expects couplings between gravity and other quantum fields which are stronger than just minimal coupling to the space time curvature. Global fields experience couplings of the form [formula], where ε is a dimensionless coupling constant of order unity, and R is the scalar curvature. Einstein equations relate R = T = ρ - 3p. In the radiation epoch of the universe, R = 0, so the coupling has no dynamical effect. But when the universe enters matter domination, this coupling will generally modify the symmetry which gave rise to the defects, and they can change their dynamics. During the onset of change, the vacuum energy contributed by the new coupling will boost the power on the largest scales, making the power spectrum consistent with the observed excess of large scale power.

These defect models have two free parameters. One is the symmetry breaking scale φ0, and the second is its coupling to the Riemann scalar ε. From the velocity dispersion in clusters of galaxies we expect φ0 / mplanck  ~  v2 / c2  ~  10- 5, which would also be related to the COBE fluctuations. This energy scale suggests that the defect would be relicts of the breaking of the Grand-Unified-Theory in the early universe. A predictive property of this model is the non-Gaussianity of fluctuations. The strongest constraints arises from the statistics of rich clusters[\cite=chiu97]. Several clusters with temperatures above 12 keV have been found[\cite=donahue], and a recent cluster with a temperature of 17 keV[\cite=tucker97] has been discovered. The existence of these very hot clusters is becoming an enigma for any Gaussian cosmological model. In non-Gaussian defect models, one would expect a larger proportion of high temperature clusters relative to low temperature ones. The recent Las Campanas galaxy survey discovered features in the two dimensional galaxy power spectrum which is inconsistent with Gaussianity[\cite=landy]. Such signs of non-Gaussianity are generically predicted in these defect models.

Several qualititive phenomena may happen due to the non-minimal coupling. Because the field interactions are different in the radiation and matter epochs, the defect energy density could be larger in the radiation epoch, which would solve the large scale structure problems of scaling defects. The hot dark matter experiences some damping out of small scale power, thus relieving the problem of excess fluctuations on small scales. Unlike the adiabatic case, the perturbations on small scales do not all free stream and damp expontially, but rather the power spectrum of the source perturbations at matter-radiation equality will be imprinted on the matter power spectrum. In simulations we have observed that the onset of the phase transition at matter radiation equality furthermore injects power at the horizon scale at that time, or about 100 Mpc scales[\cite=pt99].

In the defect scenario, the small scale CMB experiments MAP and Planck will not measure the multiple oscillations expected from adiabatic perturbations imprinted before the big bang, as predicted by inflation. Instead, the degree scale anisotropies are caused by the incoherent properties of global defects[\cite=pst97]. Without the oscillations, it will be very difficult to reconstruct cosmological parameters accurately. On the other hand, this would be an exciting measurement of fundamental physics and the history of symmetry breaking.
