Recent results from the Super-Kamiokande (S-K) detector give evidence for neutrino oscillations [\cite=1] - [\cite=4].  One of the favourable interpretations of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly suggested by the S-K collaboration is related to the existence of νμ  →  ντ neutrino oscillations. This implies that tau neutrinos have non-zero masses and therefore may also have a non-zero diagonal magnetic moment ( see e.g. ref. [\cite=5]).  As a consequence, massive tau neutrinos could manifest themselves in terrestrial experiments through the effect of νμ  →  ντ neutrino oscillations, and, if the magnetic moment value is large enough, through tau neutrino electromagnetic interactions.

In ref.[\cite=6] (see also [\cite=7]), it was shown that the combined existence of νμ  →  ντ (and/or νe  →  ντ) oscillations and non-zero magnetic moment of the tau neutrino would increase the total rate of events in νμ(νe) neutrino- electron scattering experiments. It was used to constrain the mixing angles of the tau neutrino with neutrinos of another flavour. In this Letter it is shown that this effect can also be used to constrain the magnetic moment of the tau neutrino from the S-K atmospheric neutrino data.

Assuming that a muon neutrino beam has a component of tau neutrinos due to νμ  →  ντ oscillations, in the case of two-neutrino mixing, neutrino states evolve with time t as

[formula]

where |νμ  >   and |ντ  >   denote weak eigenstates of νμ and ντ neutrinos, and a2(t), ~ b2(t) are the probabilities of finding νμ or ντ in the beam at a given moment t, respectively. It is assumed that a2(0) = 1 at t = 0.  The probability b2(t) depends on the parameters of νμ  -  ντ oscillations as [\cite=8]:

[formula]

or

[formula]

where sin 22θμτ is the mixing angle, [formula] is the difference of the squares of the mass eigenstates in eV2, Eν is the neutrino energy in GeV, and L is the mean distance between the neutrino source and the detector in km.  In the above formula it is also assumed that magnetic field B is weak enough not to affect the probability of oscillations P(νμ  →  ντ), i.e. [\cite=9]:

[formula]

Then if the magnetic moment of the ντ exists, it will contribute to a non-coherent part of the ντe- scattering cross section via the reaction that changes the helicity of the tau neutrino (hence right-handed neutrino states should exist).  This might result in a contribution to the observed deviations from unity of the flavour ratio of the atmospheric neutrino flux, [formula], in the S-K detector for both data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.  Here, [formula] and [formula] are the number of muon -like (μ-like) and electron-like (e-like) fully-contained events in the S-K detector [\cite=1].

Indeed, since the electromagnetic cross section is orders of magnitude larger than the weak cross section, even a small fraction of tau neutrinos with non-zero magnetic moment in the atmospheric neutrino flux could lead to an observable excess of isolated electrons in atmospheric neutrino interactions in the S-K detector whose signature is identical to that of e-like events. Note that the magnetic moments of muon or electron neutrino are experimentally proved to be too small to give a noticeable contribution to the neutrino interaction rate.  The production rate of isolated electrons via ντe- scattering in the detector depends on the probability P(νμ  →  ντ) of finding ντ neutrinos in the atmospheric neutrino flux. This probability can be calculated from the neutrino survival and transition probabilities using Eq.(2).  The neutrino-electron scattering process via magnetic moment has a cross section [\cite=10]:

[formula]

where Ee is the electron energy, μν is the neutrino magnetic moment and μB  =  e / 2me is Bohr magneton. For the case of constant Eν the integral cross section is

[formula]

where Emaxe, ~ Emine are the high and low electron energy cuts, respectively.  Note that the integral cross- section σμ depends very weakly on the neutrino energy. It rises only logarithmically with the neutrino energy, while the total neutrino cross section rises linearly with Eν. Thus, it is advantageous to search for a tau neutrino magnetic moment using the low energy (sub-GeV, Evisible  <  1.33 GeV) S-K data [\cite=1].

Approximately, all atmospheric neutrino giving rise to the fully contained μ-like events in the S-K detector have energy above 400 MeV, see e.g. Ref. [\cite=11] (MC studies showed the mean neutrino energy for CC interactions to be about 800 MeV for μ-like events [\cite=1]).  Thus, for the lowest electron energies analysed in the S-K, from Emine  =   100 MeV to Emaxe  =   200 MeV (first bin of the histogram in Fig.4(a) corresponding to e-like events, ref. [\cite=1]), the cross section of ντ  -  e scattering due to non-zero magnetic moment is

[formula]

Here, we assume the tau neutrino energy Eν = 400 MeV, thus the integral cross section is underestimated.

The total number ΔNe of e-like events from ντ - e scattering in the first energy of Fig.4(a) in [\cite=1] can be written in the form

[formula]

where k0 is a factor related to the ν-target mass, fν is tau neutrino flux, the cross section σμ is constant, ε is detection efficiency which is practically independent of energy for Ee  >  100 MeV [\cite=1], k1 is a factor corresponding to the convolution of detector acceptance, detection efficiency and ν-target mass and Nντ is the total number of tau-neutrinos crossing fiducial volume of the S-K detector.

The number of tau-neutrinos is estimated using the number of the initially produced muon atmospheric neutrino:

[formula]

The observation of the small value of R  =  0.61  ±  0.03(stat.)  ±  0.05(syst.) [\cite=1] and zenith angle dependent deficit of μ-like events suggests, that in the case of two -neutrino oscillation scenario of νμ  →  ντ more than 30%  ~  (90%C.L.) of the initially produced muon neutrinos arrive at the S-K detector as tau neutrinos [\cite=2] [\cite=3]. We assume that the average probability of oscillations [formula].  Muon-neutrino quasi-elastic events detected in the S-K detector were used to estimate the expected total number of muon neutrino. Similarly to Eq.(8) one can write

[formula]

where k2 has the same meaning as k1 in Eq.(8), and σνq.e.,[formula] are the cross-sections of quasi-elastic scattering of muon neutrino on (bounded) neutrons and anti-muon neutrino on protons in the H20-target, respectively, which were taken to be constant and to be equal to its maximal values of σνq.e.  =  1.0  ×  10- 38 ~ cm2 and [formula] in the energy region Eν  <  1.33 GeV, see e.g. [\cite=11].  The average cross section [formula] = ([formula]/2, since according to MC simulation used in the experiment the ratio [formula] = 1 within a few percent for the neutrino energy range considered [\cite=12]. Thus, the total muon neutrino flux is underestimated.  The number of detected quasi-elastic muon-neutrino events can be extracted from the number of μ-like events in Table 1 of ref.[\cite=1]. Under the νμ  →  ντ oscillation hypothesis used the fractions of νeCC, ~ νμCC and NC events in a detected sample of μ-like events calculated for [formula] should be 0.7%, ~ 94% and 5.3%, respectively, instead of 0.5%, ~ 95.8% and 3.7% given in Table 1 of ref.[\cite=1].  Thus, Nq.e.μ = 900  ×  .94  ×  916.9 / 1166.5  =  665 events.  We also assume that the final state signature in water Cherenkov detectors are practically the same for quasi-elastic νe and ντ - e elastic scattering processes, so detection efficiencies for these processes are the same. The efficiencies for identifying quasi-elastic νe and νμ events were 93% and 95%, respectively [\cite=1]. Finally, since detection efficiences for fully-contained e-like (Pe  >  100 MeV/c) and μ-like (Pμ  >   200 MeV/c) events are practically energy independent we neglect this small difference in efficiencies and assume that k1  =  k2.  Using the above value for Nq.e.μ, Eqs.(7-10) and μντ = 5.4  ×  10- 7μB, which corresponds to the BEBC experiment upper limit on diagonal tau neutrino magnetic moment [\cite=13], it is found that in the first bin of histogram in Fig.4(a) [\cite=1] the S-K experiment should detect:

[formula]

This number is much greater than the number of observed events, N1e,data  =  160 events, or the number of events predicted by MC simulation, N1e,MC  =  125 events in this energy bin.

The bound for the tau neutrino magnetic moment can be calculated by using the following relation :

[formula]

where (ΔN1e)90 = (N1e,data  -  N1e,MC)90 (≃ 80 events) is the 90% ~ C.L. upper limit for the expected number of e-like events from ντ  -  e scattering in the first energy bin of Fig.4(a) (ref.[\cite=1]), calculated taken into account the systematic uncertainty in the absolute normalisation of the MC events of 25% [\cite=1] by added the errors in quadrature to the statistical error.

This results in a conservative bound

[formula]

The bound is a factor 4 better than the previously published bound obtained by the BEBC experiment [\cite=13] and is obtained on the assumption that νμ  →  ντ oscillations are the origin of the anomaly in atmospheric neutrino data observed by the S-K experiment. It can be improved by a more detailed analysis of the S-K data. Note that Eq.(4) and limit of Eq.(13) are consistent for the region of Δm2  ~  (10- 3 - 10- 2) eV2 suggested by the S-K analysis [\cite=4], Eν≃O(1 GeV) and for B equal to the average magnetic field of the earth (B[formula]1 Gauss).

In the S-K detector, the oscillation scenario was checked by using π0 events [\cite=1]. For νμ  →  ντ oscillations the number of neutral -current (NC) events should be unchanged by neutrino oscillations. For νμ  →  ντ oscillations the number of νeCC events ( e-like events) should also be unchanged by neutrino oscillations. Therefore, the (π0 / e) ratio of the data should agree with the same ratio of the Monte Carlo without oscillations for νμ  →  ντ case [\cite=4]. It was obtained (π0 / e)data/(π0 / e)MC = [formula] ( preliminary). The result is consistent with the νμ  →  ντ interpretation of the S-K data, however it cannot exclude νμ  →  νs oscillation hypothesis completely.

In a recent publication [\cite=14], it was pointed out that a large diagonal and/or transition magnetic moment of neutrino can contribute to the neutral current effects ( by a single π0 production) used to distinguish the mechanisms of muon neutrino oscillation to tau neutrino or to a sterile neutrino. The effect discussed in the present Letter, as well as the effect discussed in ref. [\cite=14], definitely can affect the interpretation of atmospheric neutrino data.

Finally note that helicity flipped states of neutrinos with the large magnetic moment would be trapped in the SN1987a core, so there is no limit on the neutrino magnetic moment form SN1987a [\cite=15]. Others astrophysical constraints on μντ are also model dependent and have considerable theoretical and experimental uncertainties.
