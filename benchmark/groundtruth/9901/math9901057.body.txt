Multiplicities of Points on Schubert Varieties in Grassmannians

Main result

An important invariant of a singular point on an algebraic variety X is its multiplicity: the normalized leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of the local ring. The main result of the present note is an explicit determinantal formula for the multiplicities of points on Schubert varieties in Grassmannians. This is a simplification of a formula obtained in [\cite=ro86]. More recently, the recurrence relations for multiplicities of points on more general (partial) flag varieties were obtained in [\cite=la95a] [\cite=la90a]. However, to the best of our knowledge the case of Grassmannians remains the only case for which an explicit formula for multiplicities is available.

Fix positive integers d and n with 0  ≤  d  ≤  n, and consider the Grassmannian Grd(V) of d-dimensional subspaces in a n-dimensional vector space V (over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic). Recall that Schubert varieties in Grd(V) are parameterized by the set Id,n of integer vectors [formula] such that [formula]. For a given complete flag [formula], the Schubert variety Xı is defined as follows:

[formula]

The Schubert cell X0ı is an open subset in Xı given by

[formula]

It is well known that the Schubert variety Xı is the disjoint union of Schubert cells X0ȷ for all [formula] in the componentwise partial order on Id,n. The multiplicity of a point x in Xı is constant on each Schubert cell X0ȷ  ⊂  Xı, and we denote this multiplicity by [formula].

Our main result is the following explicit formula for [formula] (where the binomial coefficients [formula] are subject to the condition that [formula] for b  <  0):

The multiplicity [formula] of a point x∈X0ȷ  ⊂  Xı is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main] will be given in the next section. Although determinants of matrices formed by binomial coefficients were extensively studied by combinatorialists (see, e.g., [\cite=GV]), the experts whom we consulted did not recognize the determinant in ([\ref=main-form]).

We conclude this section by an example illustrating Theorem [\ref=main].

Assume the indices [formula] satisfy jd  ≤  i1. In this situation the numbers [formula] attain the smallest possible value: [formula]. Then the (p,q)-entry of the determinant in ([\ref=main-form]) has the form Pp(iq), where Pp(t) is a polynomial with the leading term tp - 1 / (p - 1)!. It follows that

[formula]

where [formula] is the Vandermonde determinant det ((ip - 1q)).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

Fix two vectors [formula] from Id,n, and let For a nonnegative integer vector [formula], we set As shown in [\cite=ro86] and [\cite=la90a], the multiplicity [formula] satisfies the initial condition [formula] and the partial difference equation

[formula]

where the sum is over all [formula] such that [formula], and [formula].

To prove ( [\ref=main-form]), we proceed by induction on [formula]. The initial step is to verify ( [\ref=main-form]) for [formula]. In this case the numbers [formula] attain their maximum possible value: sq = d - q. It follows that

[formula]

as required.

For the inductive step, we introduce some notation. To any nonnegative integer vector [formula] we associate a polynomial [formula] defined by

[formula]

here [formula] is the polynomial [formula] for s  ≥  0, and [formula] for s  <  0. Thus our goal is to show that [formula] with [formula] given by ([\ref=sij]).

For [formula], let [formula] denote the partial difference operator [formula], where [formula] are the unit vectors in [formula]. Here is the key lemma.

For any nonnegative integer vector [formula], the corresponding polynomial [formula] satisfies the partial difference equation

[formula]

First notice that the Vandermonde determinant [formula] satisfies ([\ref=dif_eqn]) since it is a non-zero skew-symmetric polynomial of minimal possible degree, and the operator [formula] preserves the space of skew-symmetric polynomials. The vector space of solutions of ([\ref=dif_eqn]) is also invariant under translations [formula] so it is enough to show that each [formula] is a linear combination of polynomials [formula]. Here is the desired expression:

[formula]

Let us prove ([\ref=main-form2]). The same argument as in Example [\ref=separated_ij] above shows that

[formula]

Substituting this expression into ([\ref=main-form2]) and performing the multiple summation, we see that the right hand side becomes the determinant of the d  ×  d matrix whose (p,q)-entry is (the last equality is a standard binomial identity). This completes the proof of ([\ref=main-form2]) and Lemma [\ref=dif_Euler].

One last piece of preparation before performing the inductive step: the Pascal binomial identity [formula] implies that

[formula]

for any nonnegative integer vector [formula] and any [formula].

To conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], suppose that [formula] and assume by induction that [formula] is given by ( [\ref=main-form]) for any [formula] such that [formula]. Let [formula] be the vector given by ([\ref=sij]). In view of  ( [\ref=recu]), the desired equality [formula] is a consequence of the following:

[formula]

where the sum is over all [formula] such that [formula], and [formula].

We shall deduce  ( [\ref=induction]) from the equality

[formula]

provided by Lemma [\ref=dif_Euler]. To do this, we compute [formula] in each of the following mutually exclusive cases (we use the conventions i0  =  0 and s0  =  d):

Case 1: [formula], iq  -  1  >  iq - 1. Then [formula] belongs to Id,n, and we have [formula]. Replacing [formula] by [formula] in ([\ref=sij]) does not change the vector [formula]. By our inductive assumption, [formula], and so [formula].

Case 2: [formula], iq  -  1  =  iq - 1. For such q, we have [formula] since the corresponding determinant has the (q - 1)th and qth columns equal to each other. Thus [formula].

Case 3: [formula], iq  -  1  >  iq - 1. As in Case 1, we have [formula], and [formula]. However now replacing [formula] by [formula] in ([\ref=sij]) changes [formula] to [formula]. Combining the inductive assumption with ([\ref=delta_P]), we conclude that [formula].

Case 4: [formula], iq  -  1  =  iq - 1. In this case, the d  ×  d matrix whose determinant is [formula] has the (q - 1)th and qth columns equal to each other, hence [formula].

Case 5: iq  =  jq. Then we have

[formula]

and so the d  ×  d matrix whose determinant is [formula] has a zero (d + 1 - q)  ×  q submatrix. As in Case 4, this implies [formula].

Adding up the contributions [formula] from all these cases, we obtain  ( [\ref=induction]); this completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=main].

In [\cite=ro86], the multiplicity [formula] was expressed as a multiple sum given by ( [\ref=main-form2]).

The multiplicity [formula] is by definition a positive integer. The partial difference equation  ( [\ref=recu]) (combined with the initial condition [formula]) makes the positivity of [formula] obvious but the fact that [formula] is an integer becomes rather mysterious. On the other hand, Theorem [\ref=main] makes it clear that [formula] is an integer but not that [formula]. It would be interesting to find an expression for [formula] that makes obvious both properties.

The space of all polynomial solutions of the partial difference equation ( [\ref=dif_eqn]) can be described as follows. Let [formula] be an auxiliary set of variables, and let [formula] be the isomorphism of vectors spaces that sends each monomial [formula] to [formula]. The map φ intertwines each Δq with the partial derivative [formula]. It follows that the space of solutions of ( [\ref=dif_eqn]) is the image under φ of the [formula]-subalgebra in [formula] generated by all differences yp  -  yq.

Jerzy Weyman informed us about the following determinantal formula (unpublished) for the multiplicity [formula] in the special case when [formula]. Let λ be the partition [formula], and let [formula] be the Frobenius notation of λ (see [\cite=mac]). According to J. Weyman, [formula] is equal to the determinant of the r  ×  r matrix whose (p,q)-entry is [formula]. It is not immediately clear why this determinantal expression agrees with the one given by ( [\ref=main-form]).
