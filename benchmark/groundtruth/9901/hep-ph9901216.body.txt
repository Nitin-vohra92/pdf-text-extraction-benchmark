ON THE T-ODD QUARK FRAGMENTATION FUNCTION AND ON TRANSVERSAL HANDEDNESS

Supported by RFBR under the Grants 96-02-17631 and 98-02-16508.

Introduction

My talk concerns the so-called single spin asymmetries in high energy physics. These are hyperons transverse polarization - observed for several hyperons produced in the scattering of unpolarized nucleons - or left-right asymmetry of pions produced from transversely polarized proton beams on unpolarized nucleon target [\cite=polar]. These phenomena have not yet a satisfactory commonly accepted explanation, in spite of many years past since their first discovery and the abundance of experimental information; all single spin asymmetries are vanishing for quark and gluons interactions in perturbative QCD and the large experimental values observed for hadrons must originate from basic non perturbative properties of nucleon structure and quark hadronization processes.

Important progresses towards their understanding have recently been made and a dedicated effort should bring much more valuable understanding. One of the hypotheses is a non-zero T-odd quark distribution [\cite=ans1] [\cite=ans2] or/and quark fragmentation functions [\cite=muldt] [\cite=muldz] [\cite=mulddis] responsible for left-right quark asymmetry inside a transversely polarized nucleon or left-right asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark. The existence of the above functions would result in peculiar asymmetries for final hadronic states, like handedness [\cite=hand] or the so-called Collins asymmetry [\cite=collins].

Some new experimental indication for the existence of these asymmetries has been recently obtained [\cite=todd] [\cite=prev] and several experimental tests have been proposed [\cite=ans2]. This indications are considered below in more detail.

T-odd quark fragmentation function

The transfer of nucleon polarization to quarks is investigated in deep-inelastic polarized lepton - polarized nucleon scattering experiments [\cite=rep]. The corresponding nucleon spin structure functions for the longitudinal spin distribution g1 and transversal spin distribution h1 for proton are well known. The opposite process, the spin transfer from partons to a final hadron, is also of fundamental interest. Analogies of f1, g1 and h1 are functions D1, G1 and H1, which describe the fragmentation of a non-polarized quark into a non-polarized hadron and a longitudinally or transversely polarized quark into a longitudinally or transversely polarized hadron, respectively .

These fragmentation functions are integrated over the transverse momentum [formula] of a quark with respect to a hadron. With [formula] taken into account, new possibilities arise. Using the Lorentz- and P-invariance one can write in the leading twist approximation 8 independent spin structures [\cite=muldt] [\cite=muldz]. Most spectacularly it is seen in the helicity basis where one can build 8 twist-2 combinations, linear in spin matrices of the quark and hadron σ, [formula] with momenta [formula], [formula]. Especially interesting is a new T-odd and helicity even structure that describes a left-right asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark: [formula] where the coefficient [formula] is a functions of the longitudinal momentum fraction z, quark transversal momentum k2T and 〈kT〉 is an average transverse momentum.

In the case of fragmentation to a non-polarized or a zero spin hadron, not only D1 but also the [formula] term will survive. Together with its analogies in distribution functions f1 and [formula], this opens a unique chance of doing spin physics with non-polarized or zero spin hadrons! In particular, since the [formula] term is helicity-odd, it makes possible to measure the proton transversity distribution h1 in semi-inclusive DIS from a transversely polarized target by measuring the left-right asymmetry of forward produced pions (see [\cite=mulddis] [\cite=kotz] and references therein).

The problem is that, first, this function is completely unknown both theoretically and experimentally and should be measured independently. Second, that the function [formula] is the so-called T-odd fragmentation function: under the naive time reversal [formula] and σ change sign, which demands a purely imaginary (or zero) [formula] in the contradiction with hermiticity. This, however, does not mean the break of T-invariance but rather the presence of an interference term of different channels in forming the final state with different phase shifts, like in the case of the single spin asymmetry phenomena [\cite=gasior]. A simple model for this function could be found in [\cite=collins]. It was also conjectured [\cite=jjt] that the final state phase shift can average to zero for a single hadron fragmentation upon summing over unobserved states X. Thus, the situation here is far from being clear.

Meanwhile, the data collected by DELPHI (and other LEP experiments) give a unique possibility to measure the function [formula]. The point is that despite the fact that the transverse polarization of a quark ( an antiquark) in Z0 decay is very small (O(mq / MZ)), there is a non-trivial correlation between transverse polarizations of a quark and an antiquark in the Standard Model: CqTT  =  (v2q  -  a2q)  /  (v2q  +  a2q), which reaches rather high values at Z0 peak: Cu,cTT  ≈   - 0.74 and Cd,s,bTT  ≈   - 0.35. With the production cross section ratio σu  /  σd = 0.78 this gives the value [formula] for the average over flavors.

The spin correlation results in a peculiar azimuthal angle dependence of produced hadrons (the so-called "one-particle Collins asymmetry"), if the T-odd fragmentation function [formula] does exist [\cite=collins] [\cite=colpsu]. The first probe of it was done three years ago [\cite=delnote95] by using a limited DELPHI statistics with the result [formula], as averaged over quark flavors.

A simpler method has been proposed recently by an Amsterdam group [\cite=muldz]. They predict a specific azimuthal asymmetry of a hadron in a jet around the axis in direction of the second hadron in the opposite jet :

[formula]

where θ2 is the polar angle of the electron and the second hadron momenta [formula], and φ1 is the azimuthal angle counted off the [formula]-plane. This looks simpler since there is no need to determine the q direction.

Event selection and measurements

This analysis covered the DELPHI data collected from 1991 through 1995. All particles were generically assumed to be pions. Only charged particles were analyzed. About 3.5 millions of [formula] hadronic decays were selected by using the standard selection criteria [\cite=DELPHI-90].

Jets were reconstructed by the JADE algorithm with varying the parameter Ycut  =  0.08, 0.05, 0.03 or 0.01. Only 2-jet events were retained for the analysis with additional thrust value selection requirement either T  ≥  0 or T  ≥  0.95. To get rid of low efficiency of the end-caps of the detector, events with the polar angle of the sphericity axis | cos θsp|  ≥  0.90 were cut off and tracks with | cos θtr|  ≥  0.98 were rejected, too. In addition, the acollinearity of the two jets Δθmaxjj was required to be [formula]. A leading particle in each jet was selected both positive and negative.

To study the detector response, a sample of Monte-Carlo events, generated with JETSET and passed through the same analysis chain as the data, was used. With these events, the correction factor

[formula]

was built for each bin in the azimuthal angle of the first leading particle φ1 and in the polar angle of the leading particle from the opposite jet θ2 (see Expr. ([\ref=mulders])).

The true distribution was defined as Ntrue  =  fcorrNraw and histograms in φ1 for each bin of θ2 were fitted by the expression

[formula]

Results and discussion

For raw data Praw2 is positive (≈  0.02) for θ2 close to [formula] but it becomes negative (up to - 0.09) for θ2 close to [formula] and [formula]. The same property but with a larger value of Psim2 (≈  0.03 in the vicinity of [formula]) is shown by MC-simulated events too. This feature is clearly interpreted as a consequence of low efficiency of the DELPHI detector in the end-cups region and of the polar angle cut-offs.

Indeed, track 1 is more close to the cone of the "dead zone" when the angle φ1 is close to [formula] (for [formula]) or to [formula] (for [formula]), which decreases the number of events at the ends of φ1-histogram and produces a negative value of P2. In contrast to this, the low efficiency between TPC-segments of the detector decreases in the number of events in the center of the φ1-histogram (near [formula]) and produces a positive values of P2.

The positivity area increases for stronger jet selection criteria (smaller ycut and larger T-cut) with more narrow jets, but the value of P2 decreases.

The Pgen2 for pure JETSET shows a weaker dependence on θ2 and is much smaller in magnitude. In the region [formula] this parameter is zero within the error bars. Therefore this region was considered as the most reliable for the determination of Ptrue2.

The best result for corrected data was obtained for ycut = 0.03 and T  ≥  0.95 selections. The value of Ptrue2 averaged over the region [formula] and over quarks flavors with [formula] was found to be

[formula]

The corresponding analyzing power according to Exp. ([\ref=mulders]) is

[formula]

Regretfully, a rather small value of Ptrue2 and, especially, the fact that it was obtained effectively as a result of subtraction of much larger values of Praw2 and Psim2 do not allow us to consider the θ2-dependence of Ptrue2 seriously. Nevertheless, we risk to present this dependence in the whole interval of θ2 in Fig.1 with corresponding fit

[formula]

which increases the value of analyzing power ([\ref=apower]) up to [formula]. The distinction with ([\ref=apower]) demonstrates, however, that systematic errors are by all means larger than the statistical ones and need further investigation.

To study this dependence in more detail, one has to increase the statistics. It could be gained by inclusion not only the leading but also next-to-leading particles into study. Also, the classical "Collins effect" should be investigated and confronted with the effect obtained.

The transverse handedness

The concept of jet handedness was introduced as a measure of polarization of parent partons (or hadrons) [\cite=hand]. For a strong interaction process, parity conservation requires that at least three particles (either spinless or spin-averaged) in a final state or a pair of particles and jet direction were measured in order to build a correlation of final momenta in the fragmentation (or decay) with initial polarization. Namely, from three particle momenta one can construct a pseudovector [formula] ([formula]) which gives, when contracted with the initial polarization pseudovector, a scalar component in the strong process. Thus, measuring the handedness - the asymmetry in relative number of events N with respect to some projection of [formula] to a direction [formula] in the rest frame of the triple - can give an information on the initial polarization Pi in this direction (at least for spin 1/2 and 1)

[formula]

provided the analyzing power αi is large enough. The direction [formula] could be chosen as longitudinal (L) with respect to the triple momentum [formula] and as transversal ones (T1 or T2) perpendicular to [formula] .

In the previous publication [\cite=prev] the attention was drawn to the fact that in diffractive production of pion triples [\cite=mis]

[formula]

by π- beam 40 GeV / c from a nucleus A, a noticeable asymmetry with respect to the triple production plane (transversal handedness HT1) was observed. Here I will talk about further experimental investigation of this phenomenon [\cite=yaf99]. It includes a new information on the dependence of the transversal handedness on the variables:

Atomic number of the target,

Transversal momenta of the pion triple,

Feynmann variable XF of the leading π-,

Invariant mass of the triple,

Invariant mass of neutral pairs π+π-.

Also the statistics was considerably increased.

Definitions and notation

For reaction ([\ref=react]), let us define the normal to the plane of production of a secondary pion triple (π-fπ+π-s)

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are velocities of the initial π- beam and the center of mass of the triple in Lab. r.f. and indices f and s label fast and slow π-'s. The normal to the "decay plane" of the triple in its center of mass is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] or [formula] are velocities of the fast (slow) π- or π+.

The transversal handedness according to ([\ref=hand]) is

[formula]

Two other components of the handedness connected with [formula] and [formula] are forbidden by the parity conservation in the strong interaction .

Experimental results and discussion

The transversal handedness ([\ref=trahand]) was measured for a wide sample of nuclear targets: Be, 12C, 28Si, 48Ti, 63Cu, 107Ag, 181Ta and 207Pb. The total number of selected events of pion triples with leading π- was about 250,000.

The dependence of HT1 on the atomic number A is presented in Fig.2. One can see that the handedness systematically decreases with increasing A, which resembles a depolarization effect in multiple scattering. An argument in this favor is the decrease of the effect as, approximately, inverse nuclei radius.

The value of the asymmetry ([\ref=trahand]), averaged over all nuclei is

[formula]

Statistically, this is highly reliable verification of the existence of correlation of the triple production and decay planes in process ([\ref=react]).

The values of two other asymmetries with respect to correlations [formula] and [formula] was found to be comparable to zero from the same statistical material: [formula] and [formula] respectively. This is by no means surprising, since they are forbidden by the parity conservation.

A natural question is to what extent the effect observed is due to the kinematics or apparatus influence, in particular, due to acceptance of the experimental setup where the events have been registered. For this aim the Monte-Carlo events of reaction ([\ref=react]) were generated with a constant mass spectrum of the 3π-system in the interval 0.6-2.5 GeV / c2 and with the exponential decrease of the cross section in t' = t - tmin with the slope (for beryllium) 40  (GeV / c)- 2, found experimentally. This events were traced through the apparatus simulation and the same selection of events shows no transversal handedness HT1

[formula]

For two other asymmetries, forbidden by the parity conservation, the result was [formula] and [formula], respectively. Thus, the effect ([\ref=result]) cannot be explained by the kinematics or apparatus influence.

To understand the nature of the effect observed, the dependence of the handedness ([\ref=trahand]) on the Feynmann variable XF of the leading π-, on the invariant mass of the triple m3π and its neutral subsystem mπ+π- and on the triple transversal momentum kT was studied. From Fig.3 one can see that the handedness ([\ref=trahand]) increases with XF, which resembles the behavior of the single spin asymmetry (e.g. the pion asymmetry or the Λ-polarization [\cite=polar]).

The dependence of HT1 on the triple invariant mass (Fig.4a) is especially interesting. It clearly indicates two different sources of HT1 with comparable contributions: a resonant and a non-resonant one. The resonance contribution is clearly seen at the mass of a1(1260) and π2(1670) region and by no means is due to a non-zero polarization of the resonances. The non-resonant background could also be polarized, provided that the 3π system is predominantly in a state with the total angular momentum [formula], e.g. if a neutral pair mπ+π- was predominantly produced from ρ-decay. Some indication of this can be seen from Fig.4b. In this context, the growth of HT1 in the region of small m3π, i.e. in the region of small relative momenta of pions, looks quite intriguing.

A complicated picture of the kT-dependence with a sharp deep at kT = 0.05 - 0.07  GeV / c (Fig.5) reflects by all means the fact of interference of the resonant and non-resonant processes in the triple production. With further increase of kT the handedness increases which resembles the single spin asymmetry behavior too.

To check this assumption the events with invariant mass m3π in the a1 and π2 resonance region 1.05-1.80  GeV were excluded from further analysis. This however does not lead us to a definite conclusion since for Be and C the deep disappears while conserves for Si with some change of its form and width. The average value of the handedness stays at the same level 5-11% with high statistical significance.

Notice also that in earlier study of reaction ([\ref=react]) at 4.5  GeV for the proton target at the hydrogen bubble chamber no angular dependence of the normal [formula] ([\ref=norm]) was found just as in the Regge pole exchange model, which provides a reasonable description of that experiment [\cite=rpem].

Conclusions

In conclusion, we present some arguments in favor of a non-zero T-odd transversely polarized quark fragmentation function and the transverse handedness. The corresponding analyzing power could reach an order of 10 per cent, which makes us hope to use this effects for measuring of the transverse quark polarization in other hard processes. In particular, it can be used in the deep inelastic scattering for measurement of nucleon transversity distribution, since helicity evenness of [formula]. Further increase of the accuracy and the investigation of systematic errors are required.

The transverse handedness has a clear dynamical origin and in some features resembles the single spin asymmetry behavior. For a more detailed study of the phenomenon, a partial wave analysis of reaction ([\ref=react]) seems necessary.
