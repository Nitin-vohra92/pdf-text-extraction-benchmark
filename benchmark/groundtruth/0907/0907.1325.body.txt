Introduction

In the paper [\cite=szi], Sziklai posed a conjecture on the number of points of a plane curve over a finite field. Let C be a plane curve of degree d over [formula] without an [formula]-linear component. Then he conjectured that the number of [formula]-points Nq(C) of C would be at most (d - 1)q  +  1. But he had overlooked the known example of a curve of degree 4 over [formula] with 14 points ([\cite=ser], [\cite=gee-vlu]). So we must modify this conjecture.

Unless C is a curve defined over [formula] which is projectively equivalent to

[formula]

over [formula], we might have

[formula]

Here we make two parenthetical remarks on this conjecture. Since C is defined by a homogeneous equation F(X,Y,Z)  =  0, we understand the set of [formula]-points [formula] of C to be the set of [formula]-points [formula] such that F(α,β,γ)  =  0, that is to say, it is no matter whether each of those points is nonsingular or not. The second remark is that the conjecture makes sense only if 2  ≤  d  ≤  q + 1 because the conjectural bound exceeds the obvious bound [formula] if d  ≥  q + 2.

In the previous paper [\cite=hom-kim2], we proved the inequality

[formula]

which guarantees the inequality ([\ref=guess]) for d = q + 1, and presented an example of a curve of degree q + 1 having q2 + 1 [formula]-points. Moreover, we observed that if a curve of degree 4 over [formula] has more than 13 rational points, then this curve is projectively equivalent to the curve ([\ref=counterexample]) over [formula].

The main purpose of this paper is to show the following. Note that the truth of the inequality ([\ref=guess]) for d = q = 3 is classical [\cite=seg], and it is well known for d = q = 2. Additionally, we show that ([\ref=guess]) holds if the curve C is nonsingular of degree d  ≤  q - 1. Therefore, together with our previous results, the following theorem is established.

Simplification of the problem

To settle the modified Sziklai's conjecture affirmatively, we may suppose the curve C to be absolutely irreducible without an [formula]-rational singular point. Actually the following three facts hold. Throughout this section, we assume that the degree of C is at most q + 1.

If C is reducible over [formula], then Nq(C)  <  (d - 1)q.

If C has an irreducible component which is not defined over [formula], then Nq(C)  ≤  (d - 1)q.

If C has a singular point which is an [formula]-point, then Nq(C)  ≤  (d - 1)q.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=irredfq]. Let [formula], where each curve Ci is of degree di, and defined over [formula] without an [formula]-linear component. By a theorem of Segre [\cite=seg]

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the integer part of [formula]. Hence Nq(C)  ≤  Nq(C1)  +  Nq(C2)  ≤  (d - 1)q because d1  +  d2  =  d  ≤  q + 1. [formula] Proof of Proposition [\ref=noirredcompnotfq]. Let C1 be an irreducible component of C which is not defined over [formula], and [formula] the minimum extension of [formula] over which C1 is defined. Since the t conjugates [formula] of C1 over [formula] are components of C, [formula], where C' is a curve defined over [formula] or [formula]. Let e  =   deg C1, so [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] by Bézout's theorem.

First we consider the case [formula]. In this case, d'  =   deg C'  ≥  2 and d = d'  +  te. By ([\ref=previousbound]), Nq(C')  ≤  d'(q - 1) + 2, so Nq(C)  ≤  d'(q - 1) + 2 + e2. Since q + 1  ≥  d > e,

[formula]

Next we consider the case [formula]. Then d  =  te and Nq(C)  ≤  e2. Since

[formula]

we have e2  ≤  (d - 1)q. [formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=nofqsing]. Let P0 be a singular and [formula]-rational point of C. Then for each [formula]-line l passing through P0, [formula]. So Nq(C)  ≤  (d - 2)(q + 1) + 1  ≤  (d - 1)q because d  ≤  q + 1. [formula]

The proof for the case d = q > 4

Throughout this section, we fix a plane curve C over [formula] of degree q without an [formula]-linear component. Suppose that [formula].

Fix an [formula]-point P0∈C, and an [formula]-line [formula] with [formula]. Suppose there are [formula]-lines [formula] with q  ≥  t  ≥  3 passing through P0 such that the q [formula]-points of [formula] are contained in C. For an [formula]-line l∋P0 other than these t lines, if [formula], then all the q [formula]-points of [formula] are contained in C.

Proof. Choose coordinates X,Y,Z of [formula] as l1 is defined by X = 0, l2 by Y = 0, and l∞ by Z = 0. So P0 = (0,0,1). Let

[formula]

be an affine equation over [formula] defining C on the affine plane [formula] with affine coordinates [formula], [formula]. Since [formula], f(0,β) = 0 for any [formula]. Hence f(0,y)  =  a0q(yq - y) because the degree of f(0,y) is at most q. Similarly, f(x,0)  =  aq0(xq - x). Hence

[formula]

where [formula]. Let y  =  uμx ([formula]) be an affine equation of the line lμ for [formula]. Here [formula] denotes the multiplicative group [formula] Since f(α,uμα) = 0 for any [formula] by the assumption on lμ, we have

[formula]

Since [formula],

[formula]

Hence each equation gν(1,y) = 0 has at least t - 2 zeros, which implies [formula] as polynomials. So

[formula]

Let y = vx ([formula]) be an equation of l. By the assumption on l, there are at least q - t + 1 elements [formula] so that f(αi,vαi)  =  0 for each [formula]. Hence

[formula]

Since [formula], we have [formula], and get f(1,v) = 0. [formula]

Fix an [formula]-point [formula] Suppose there are [formula]-lines [formula] with q - 1  ≥  t  ≥  2 passing through Q0 such that [formula]. If an [formula]-line l∋Q0 other than these t lines has at least q - t + 1 [formula]-points of C, then [formula]

Proof. First choose q - t + 1 points in [formula], and then choose an [formula]-point P' of [formula] other than these q - t + 1 points. Fix an [formula]-line, say l∞, such that l∞∋P' but [formula]. Choose coordinates X,Y,Z of [formula] so that l1 is defined by X = 0, l2 by Y = 0, and l∞ by Z = 0. Then Q0 = (0,0,1). Let

[formula]

be a homogeneous equation over [formula] defining C. Since [formula] [formula] for any [formula]. So F(0,1,Z)  =  a00(Zq - Z), and hence F(0,Y,Z)  =  a00(Zq - Yq - 1Z). Similarly F(X,0,Z)  =  a00(Zq - Xq - 1Z). Therefore

[formula]

where [formula]

In general, any line L over [formula] which contains Q0 but is not l1 nor l2 is defined by an equation of the form Y = uX for some [formula]. So [formula]. Note that

[formula]

because βq  -  β  -  uq - 1β  =    -  β. Let Y = uμX be an equation of l2  +  μ ([formula]). Note that these uμ's are not 0. Then

[formula]

Since [formula] we have, in particular, [formula] Hence if ν  <  t - 2, then gν(1,y) = 0 as a polynomial in y, because gν(1,y) = 0 has t - 2 roots [formula] but its degree is less than t - 2. Therefore

[formula]

Let Y = vX be an equation of l, and {(1,v,βi)|1  ≤  i  ≤  q - t + 1} a set of chosen points of [formula] Then

[formula]

Hence [formula] and then F(1,v,β) = 0 for any [formula], which means that [formula]. [formula]

Now we prove the following theorem by a reduction to absurdity.

Let C be a plane curve over [formula] of degree q without an [formula]-linear component. If q > 4, then Nq(C)  ≤  (q - 1)q + 1.

By the previous result ([\ref=previousbound]), Nq(C)  ≤  (q - 1)q + 2. We prove the absurdity of the equality Nq(C)  =  (q - 1)q + 2. Moreover, by the arguments in Section [\ref=Sec_sim], we may assume that C is irreducible and each [formula]-rational point of C is nonsingular.

Until the end of this section, we suppose that C is an irreducible plane curve of degree q over [formula] with Nq(C) = (q - 1)q + 2 and no point of [formula] is singular.

Some symbols should be introduced here. [formula] is the projective plane of lines in the original plane [formula]. So [formula] means the set of [formula]-lines of [formula]. Let

[formula]

and [formula]

Under Setup  [\ref=setup_q], we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. (1) is obvious. For (2), consider the point-line correspondence

[formula]

with two projections [formula] and [formula]. Counting the number [formula] by using π1, we have (q + 1)(q2 - q + 2), and by π2, [formula]

For (3), consider the correspondence

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the symmetric product of two copies of [formula] and Δ the diagonal subset of [formula]. Counting [formula] by using the first projection [formula] and the second projection [formula], we have the desired formula.

For (4), consider the correspondence

[formula]

where i(l.C;P) denotes the intersection multiplicity of l and C at P. Note that for each point [formula], there is a unique [formula]-line l such that i(l.C;P)  ≥  2 because C is nonsingular at P. So [formula] Let [formula] be the second projection. For a line l∈Ai, let [formula] For each point P of these sl points on l, i(l.C;P)  ≥  2 by definition. Hence we have 2sl  +  i - sl  ≤  (l.C)  =  q by Bézout's theorem. So sl  ≤   min {i,q - i}. Hence [formula] [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=theorem_q]. Step I. We prove that a0  =  a1  =  0.

By (1), (2) and (4) of Lemma [\ref=numberofpointonl],

[formula]

Hence a0  =  a1  =  0.

Step II. We prove that a2 = 0.

Suppose a2  >  0. Choose a line l0∈A2. Two of the q + 1 [formula]-points of l0 are on C, say P0 and P1, and the other q - 1 are not on C, say [formula] Let [formula] be the set of [formula]-lines passing through P0. For each line li with 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, there is an [formula]-point Qi of li not lying on C because [formula]. Note that [formula] because Nq(C)  =  (q - 1)q + 2. So Qi is the unique [formula]-point of li which does not lie on C. If one considers the all lines passing through P1, say [formula], each line li' (1  ≤  i  ≤  q) has a unique [formula]-point not lying on C. So we may assume li'∋Qi for [formula]. Hence the line QiQj never meets with P0 nor P1. In particular, P0,Qi,Qj are not collinear for any 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  q with i  ≠  j, and neither are P1,Qi,Qj. If three of [formula] are collinear, so are [formula] by Proposition [\ref=blackpoint], which is a contradiction by Step I. Therefore [formula] forms a (q + 2)-arc. Hence q must be a power of 2 [\cite=hir]. So q  ≥  8 because q > 4 a priori.

Next let us consider the q [formula]-lines passing through P2' other than l0, say [formula]. It is easy to see that a (q + 2)-arc has no unisecant. So half of [formula] do not meet K, and each line of the other half meets K at two points. Since q  ≥  8, we may assume that [formula] (i = 1,2,3) and [formula] Applying Proposition [\ref=whitepoint] to P2',m1,m2,m3 and m4 as l, we have m4 is also an external line to K, which is a contradiction.

Step III. Let [formula]. We prove that 3  ≤  k  ≤  q - 3.

We already saw k  ≥  3. Suppose that k  ≥  q - 2, namely, [formula] Hence, by Lemma [\ref=numberofpointonl], we have

[formula]

Making - q(q - 2) times Eq. ([\ref=III1]) plus 2q - 3 times Eq. ([\ref=III2]) minus 2 times Eq. ([\ref=III3]), we know aq - 1  =  (q - 2)(4 - q), which is impossible because q > 4.

Step IV. Fix a line l0∈Ak, where k is the number explained in the previous step. Let [formula] be the k [formula]-points of l0 that lie on C, and [formula] the remaining [formula]-points of l0. Let [formula]. Since [formula], [formula]. In this step, we show that there is a point Q∈S so that [formula]

Consider the correspondence

[formula]

with projections π1:A'  →  S and [formula] Our claim is that there is a point Q∈S so that [formula]. For each line l∋Pi except l0, [formula] because deg C  =  q, and these q lines ∋Pi cover S. Hence we may suppose that [formula] and those q lines are [formula]. Under this notation, PiQj∈Aq if and only if [formula]. So we have [formula], and then [formula]. If [formula] for any Q∈S, we have [formula]. So 2(q + k - 2)  -  k(q - k + 2) must be nonnegative. But this number is equal to (k - 2)(k  -  (q - 2)), which is a contradiction because 3  ≤  k  ≤  q - 3 by Step III.

Step V. Choose a point Q∈S having the property described in the previous step. We may suppose that PiQ∈Aq for [formula] with 3  ≤  s  ≤  k, and other q + 1 - s lines [formula] passing through Q do not belong to Aq. Let m be one of these q + 1 - s lines. Then [formula], otherwise m∈Aq by Proposition [\ref=whitepoint]. Hence

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

On the other hand, since [formula],

[formula]

which is a contradiction. This completes the proof. [formula]

Nonsingular plane curves of degree at most q - 1

In this section, we consider a nonsingular plane curve C over [formula] of degree d with 1  <  d  ≤  q - 1.

Under the above setting, we have Nq(C)  ≤  (d - 1)q + 1.

Proof. To show this bound, we need some results by the Brazilian school of curve theory. We explain those briefly only for plane nonsingular curves. A nonsingular plane curve C defined over [formula] is said to be q-Frobenius nonclassical if Fq(P)∈TP(C) for a general [formula]-point P, where Fq is the q-th power Frobenius map and TP(C) is the embedded tangent line at P to C. Needless to say, a q-Frobenius classical curve is a curve which is not q-Frobenius nonclassical. Stöhr and Voloch [\cite=sto-vol] showed that if C is q-Frobenius classical of degree d, then

[formula]

and Hefez and Voloch [\cite=hef-vol] proved that if C is q-Frobenius nonclassical of degree d, then [formula] and

[formula]

Each of these two estimates for Nq(C) is stronger than the expected bound if 2  ≤  d  ≤  q - 1 for ([\ref=classical]) or [formula] for ([\ref=nonclassical]). In fact,

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

The Stöhr-Voloch bound ([\ref=classical]) is effective even if an irreducible q-Frobenius classical curve C has singularities. By tracing the proof of [\cite=hef-vol] carefully, we know that if each singular point of an irreducible q-Frobenius nonclassical curve C is not a cusp, then the Hefez-Voloch bound Nq(C)  ≤  d(q - d  +  2) is valid for C. With those bounds, taking into account the fact that Weil's bound holds for any irreducible plane curve C of degree d as [formula] [\cite=hir-kor-tor], we can weaken the assumption on C of Theorem [\ref=the_d<q] as C is an irreducible curve without cusp singularities.

Examples

The proof of Theorem [\ref=the_d<q], together with Theorem [\ref=theorem_q] and the previous result [\cite=hom-kim2], shows the following fact also.

The possible degrees d of a nonsingular curve C over [formula] with (d - 1)q  +  1 rational points are

[formula]

For each d above, we give curves with concrete equation that attain the bound ([\ref=guess]).

Let d  =  q + 2. In this case, the bound is q2  +  q + 1 which is the number of [formula]. We know all irreducible or nonsingular curves of degree q + 2 over [formula] that passing through all of the points of [formula]. For details, see Tallini [\cite=tal] and Homma-Kim [\cite=hom-kim].

Let d = q + 1. In the previous paper [\cite=hom-kim2], we presented the curve

[formula]

has q2  +  1 [formula]-rational points.

Let d = q. Consider a curve C defined by

[formula]

Then it is easy to see that C is nonsingular and

[formula]

Hence Nq(C)  =  q2 + q + 1  -  2q  =  (q - 1)q + 1.

Let d = q - 1. As was mentioned by Sziklai [\cite=szi], the curve αXq - 1  +  βYq - 1  -  (α  +  β)Zq - 1 = 0 with αβ(α  +  β)  ≠  0 has (q - 2)q  +  1 rational points. This curve is nonsingular and the set of rational points is

[formula]

Let q be a square. Then a Hermitian curve C of degree [formula] over [formula] attains this bound. Actually, [formula].

Let d = 3. For a fixed field [formula], there is a nonsingular curve over [formula] with 2q + 1 rational points if and only if q = 2 or 3 or 4. For details, see Schoof [\cite=sch].

Let d = 2. It is well-known that any nonsingular quadratic over [formula] has rational points.
