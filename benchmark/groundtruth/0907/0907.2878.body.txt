Quantum measurement theory for particle oscillations

The two-slit and related experiments demonstrate a striking feature of quantum mechanics: for any two alternatives that cannot be distinguished by a measurement scheme, their joint probability is obtained by summing their contributions at the level of probability amplitudes; therefore interference terms appear. If, however, a macroscopic distinction of these alternatives is possible, the interference terms are suppressed and the joint probability is the sum of the individual probabilities.

Let us examine the importance of the above elementary point for the correct quantum treatment of particle oscillations [\cite=osc]. The detection time of the oscillating particles is not directly measured. Instead, we measure the number of detection events, at distance L from the source. The question then arises: how, starting from the probability amplitude Aα(t,x)--for the detection of a flavor α, at a point x, at sharply defined moment of time t--, we can obtain the probability pα(L) that a particle of flavor α will be detected at distance L from the source.

A common approach is to substitute in Aα(t,x) the time t with the classical time of arrival at L, namely L / c for neutrinos, and to write the corresponding probability as pα(L)  ~  |Aα(L,L)|2. The usual setting for this approach is the textbook plane-wave treatment of neutrino oscillations, where

[formula]

Here, i labels the mass eigenstates of neutrinos, Uiα is the mixing matrix, β is the initial flavor, pi are the momenta in the different mass-eigenspaces and the corresponding energies [formula]. The substitution t  =  L in Eq. ([\ref=ampl00]) and the evaluation of the detection probability yields the standard expression for the oscillation wavenumber kij  =  (m2i  -  m2j) / (2p), for pi  =  p + O(mi).

This method involves an unsatisfactory mixing of classical and quantum concepts and this problem persists if we consider realistic wave packets rather than plane waves. More importantly, the method is ambiguous in the following way: different mass eigenstates correspond to different velocities vi  =  pi / Ei; if we evaluate each mass-component at the corresponding arrival times ti  =  L / vi, then we obtain an oscillation wave-number kij  =  (m2i  -  m2j) / p for pi  =  p + O(mi), which is twice the standard result .

Furthermore, the standard method assumes that the detection time should be computed in terms of an 'average' velocity for all components of the wave packet--see, for example, Refs. [\cite=Giu03] [\cite=Lip]. This assumption involves the substitution of a coherent superposition by an altogether different state that cannot be done in an invariant way in quantum mechanics. Any choice of an 'average velocity' for a wave packet is arbitrary and unjustified at a fundamental level.

An improved derivation of the standard expression for the oscillation wavelength proceeds by calculating the time average of probabilities over detection time, i.e., defining [formula], where T is the integration time for the experiment. However, a summation of probabilities over detection time is not justified by the rules of quantum theory. As the two-slit experiment indicates, alternatives that cannot be distinguished by measurement--in this case, detections of a flavor α at different moments of time--are to be summed over at the level of amplitudes.

The summation over amplitudes, defined at different moments of time, is rather intricate because there is no time operator in quantum theory. Hence the methods that apply to other observables are not directly applicable here. The method we present in this letter has the following advantages: (i) it fully implements the basic principle, that alternatives that are not distinguished by measurement are to be summed at the level of amplitudes; (ii) it incorporates a genuinely quantum treatment of detection time, according to the quantum theory of measurement [\cite=QMT]; (iii) it employs a general formula, Eq. ([\ref=prob]), that is derived using only the rules of quantum theory. Eq. ([\ref=prob]) is valid for any setup in which the detection time is not measurable, not only to particle oscillations. The end result is an expression for the detection probability as a function of distance; it leads to the non-standard formula for the oscillation wave-number kij  =  (m2i  -  m2j) / p that was mentioned previously.

In what follows, we describe in more detail our approach and the derivation of the results above. We employ a method developed in [\cite=AS], for the construction of probabilities from amplitudes that are defined at different moments of time. It has been applied to various problems, such as probabilities for time-of-arrival, tunneling-time and for non-exponential decays. This method contains ideas from the decoherent histories approach to quantum mechanics [\cite=scg] and it has many similarities to the Srinivas-Davies photo-detection theory [\cite=SD81].

The first step in our study is the derivation for a general formula for the probability of detection outcomes, when the time of detection is not observable. (The presentation here is simplified: for elaboration on the finer points, see Ref. [\cite=AS].) Let H be the Hilbert space of a quantum system, and Ĥ the Hamiltonian operator. In order to describe an event--such as a particle detection--we introduce a projection operator P̂ that corresponds to states accessible only if the event has taken place. For example, if we detect a particle by monitoring a specific decay process, then P̂ is a projector onto the states of all product particles.

The Hilbert space H splits into two subspaces corresponding to the projectors P̂ and   =  1  -  P̂. Let P̂λ be the projection operators corresponding to different values λ of an observable that can be measured only if a detection event has occurred. For example, P̂λ may correspond to a coarse-grained position variable for a product particle. The set of projectors P̂λ is exclusive (P̂λP̂λ'  =  0, if λ  ≠  λ') and exhaustive, provided a detection has occurred; i.e., [formula].

Starting from the initial state of a quantum system |ψ0〉, we construct the amplitude |ψ;t,λ〉, at a final time T, that arises if a detection event took place within the interval   ⊂  [0,T] and the outcome of the measurement was λ. By assumption, no detection took place before time t. Hence, we evolve |ψ0〉 with Ŝt  =   lim N  →    ∞(e- iĤt / N)N, i.e., with the restricted propagator in the eigenspace of the projector [formula] to no-detection states. In the interval

[formula]

is

[formula]

where 0  =  |ψ0〉〈ψ0|. The probability measure Eq. ([\ref=prob]) is positive, linear, and normalized when the probability of no-detection [formula] is included.

If the Hamiltonian is of the form Ĥ  =  Ĥ0  +  ĤI, where   =  0 and ĤI a small perturbation, then, to leading order in the perturbation,

[formula]

where Ût  =  e-  iĤ0t.

Eqs. ([\ref=prob]-[\ref=prob2]) are general operator expressions valid for any system. Next we apply them to the case of particle oscillations. Since the oscillating particles are detected by means of their decay products, the precise treatment of the detection process involves the use of quantum field theory. We will not specify the type of oscillating particles so that our results will be valid for both neutrino and neutral boson oscillations.

To this end, let us denote the oscillating particles as A and consider that their detection involves the process A  +  Bm  →  Dn, where Bm and Dn are particles labeled by indices m and n. The Hilbert space H of the total system is a tensor product [formula], where HA is the (bosonic or fermionic) Fock space F(H1A). The single-particle Hilbert space H1A is a direct sum [formula] of mass eigenspaces Hi. Hr is the Hilbert space for the degrees of freedom corresponding to the Bm and Dn particles. It is decomposed as [formula]: H0 is the subspace of states prior to the decay A  +  Bm  →  Dn and Hprod is the subspace corresponding to states of the decay products . Since we assume that the measurements are carried out to the product particles, then the projection operators P̂λ in Eq. ([\ref=prob]) are of the form [formula], where Π̂λ projects into a subspace of Hprod.

We assume a Hamiltonian of the form [formula], where ĤA is the Hamiltonian for the A particles, Ĥr is the Hamiltonian for the Bm and Dn particles, and ĤI is the interaction Hamiltonian. For simplicity, we assume that any particles Bm that are present prior to detection are stationary. Hence, the restriction of Ĥr to H0 is a constant, which can be taken equal to zero. The restriction of Ĥr on Hprod equals [formula], where [formula] is the threshold energy of the A particles for the process A  +  Bm  →  Dn. In the above, MBm and MDn are the masses of the particles Bm and Dn respectively and n are the momentum operators for the Dn particles.

We consider an effective interaction Hamiltonian

[formula]

where [formula] are annihilation and creator operators on HA, i labels mass eigenstates, [formula] are current operators of flavor α defined on Hr, and Uiα is the mixing matrix. The current operator Ĵ±α involves products of annihilation operators for the B particles and creation operators for the D particles. Since no A particles are created during the detection process, the initial state |φ0〉 in Hr must satisfy [formula]. Note that if the detection involves a scattering process rather than a decay, an interaction Hamiltonian quadratic to the field of the A particles should be used, instead of ([\ref=hi]).

Let the initial state on HA be a single-particle state [formula], where |0〉A is the vacuum of HA. Since   =  0, Eq. ([\ref=prob2]) applies. Hence, the probability that a decay through flavor α has happened at some time in
