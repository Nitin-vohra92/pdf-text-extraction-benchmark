Attraction and repulsion in spacetimeof an electrically charged mass-point

PACS 04.20 - General relativity.

1. - The metric. - If [formula], we have (see [\cite=1]÷  [\cite=7]):

[formula]

where: [formula]; [formula]; and 4πε is the electric charge of the gravitating point-mass m; γ(r = 0)  =    +    ∞  ; γ(r =   ∞  )  =  1.

Two cases: m2  <  q2, in particular m = 0; and m2  ≥  q2. (For the electron we have m2  <  q2).

If m2  <  q2, γ(r) is everywhere positive, with a minimal value at r = q2 / m: [formula]; if m = 0, [formula].

If m2  =  q2, [formula]; [formula]; [formula].

If m2  >  q2, we can write:

[formula]

let us put: [formula] and [formula]. On the spherical surfaces r = r1 and r = r2, we have γ(r1,2) = 0. It is easy to see that when r2 < r < r1, γ(r) < 0, but γ(r < r2) > 0.

2. - Radial geodesics of light-rays. - If s2 = 0 = ω2, we have γ  t2  =  γ- 1r2, from which:

[formula]

[formula]; [formula]. For m2 > q2, we have [formula]; and for m2 = q2, [formula].

The integration of [\cite=3] gives:

[formula]

thus, when m2 > q2:

[formula]

this means that a light-ray which starts from an r > r1, arrives at r = r1 after an infinite time interval (and with a velocity equal to zero): we have a Hilbertian gravitational repulsion.

When m2 = q2:

[formula]

for r = m, ±    (t  +  )  =    ∞  : Hilbertian repulsion, as far m2 > q2 (and a velocity [formula]).

When m2 < q2, we have:

[formula]

a light-ray arrives at r = 0 in a finite time: gravitational attraction.

When m = 0:

[formula]

attraction, as for m2 < q2.

Let us compute the acceleration [formula]:

[formula]

of course, [formula]. We have:

for m2 > q2: [formula] at r = r1, repulsion; [formula] at r = 0);   for m2 = q2: [formula] at r = m, repulsion; [formula] at r = 0);   for m2 < q2: [formula] at r = 0, attraction; [formula] at r = q2 / m;   for m = 0: [formula] at r = 0, attraction.

When m2  ≥  q2 a light-ray which arrives at r = r1 starting from an r > r1 cannot overcome the barrier r = r1: indeed, velocity [formula] and acceleration [formula] are zero at r = r1. (On the contrary, gravitational attraction predominates in the interval 0  ≤  r  <  r2).

3. - Radial geodesics in general. - We have the following first integral:

[formula]

where A < 0 for test-particles, and A = 0 for light-rays. We get from eq. ([\ref=eq:ten]) that

[formula]

The case m2  ≥  q2 for [formula] is interesting. When [formula], attraction and repulsion balance each other. Putting [formula] in eq. ([\ref=eq:eleven]), we obtain

[formula]

and substituting eq. ([\ref=eq:twelve]) in eq. ([\ref=eq:ten]):

[formula]

a motion described by the balance velocity [formula] has a zero acceleration. Where [formula], there is attraction; where [formula] there is repulsion.

At r = r1, velocity [formula] and acceleration [formula] are equal to zero: no particle, no light-ray can overcome this barrier. Remark that for the light-rays there is repulsion on the whole trajectory (m2  ≥  q2).

The study of the circular geodesics confirms the existence of the Hilbertian repulsion: as for the Schwarzschild manifold (see [\cite=8]), there is a minimal value for the radial coordinate r of the test-.particles, and a unique value for the r of light-rays (m2  ≥  q2).

When q2 > m2, there is no gravitational repulsion.

A remark. If the term q2 / r2 of γ(r), which is originated by the mass-energy of the electrostatic field ε / r2, were endowed with a Newtonian nature, it would have a repulsive action. On the contrary, it has in GR an attractive effect, as it is particularly evidenced by the case q2 > m2.

4. - A coordinate choice à la Brillouin(-Schwarzschild). - For m2  ≥  q2, a reasonable choice of a new radial coordinate removes the singularity at r = 0 of eq. ([\ref=eq:one]); indeed, let us perform the following substitution:

[formula]

at r = 0, the new γ is zero, which is its minimal value. Our manifold is maximally extended and geodesically complete. This form of the metric is diffeomorphic to the exterior part r  ≥  r1 of the form ([\ref=eq:one]). The known generalization à la Kruskal-Szekeres of the s2 of eq. ([\ref=eq:one]) is quite superfluous, and misrepresents the permanent gravitational field created by m and q.

For q = 0, substitution ([\ref=eq:fourteen]) becomes r  →  r + 2m, i.e., that substitution of the coordinate r of the standard metric of Schwarzschild manifold, which gives the Brillouin(-Schwarzschild) s2 , see [\cite=9].

In a reasonable treatment there is no room for a real existence of black holes. The consideration of the Brillouin(-Schwarzschild) metric reinforces the conclusion of sects. 2 and 3.

A last remark. We think that the choice of the global time t = x0 (Weyl's "kosmische Zeit" [\cite=2]) as dynamical evolution parameter for the radial geodesics of Schwarzschild, Kerr and Reiß ner-Weyl-Nordström manifolds is the most appropriate one from the physical point of view [\cite=8]. In particular, it allows a unique treatment of the trajectories of test-particles and light-rays, while the employment of the proper time (which is influenced by particle motion) is limited to the geodesics of the test particles.

APPENDIX

With the metric of eq. ([\ref=eq:one]) the electrostatic field F01(r) created by the charged gravitating mass m is simply equal to ε / r2 ("merit" of the term r2  ω2 in eq. ([\ref=eq:one])). As it was remarked by von Laue [\cite=6], this is an expression "die sich von der entsprechenden der Elektrostatik im Euklidischen dadurch unterscheidet, daß r nicht den natürlich gemessenen Abstand vom Ladungsträger bedeutet."

With a different form of the metric we have a more complicated expression of the e.s. field. For instance, in Bergmann's metric [\cite=7] the e.m. potential Φ is not given by -  ε / r, but by the following formulae (where ε is equal to -  ε of eq. ([\ref=eq:one])):

[formula]

if [formula]; and by

[formula]

if m2 > q2. When m2 = q2, we have

[formula]

For Φ  /  r there is a unique formula:

[formula]

It is interesting that at r = m  ±  (m2 - q2)1 / 2 the field Φ  /  r and the potential Φ have infinite values.

Bergmann's formulae make particularly evident that in GR e.m. field and gravitational field influence each other in a significant way.
