Nonlocal symmetries of evolution equations.

Introduction

Classical Lie symmetries has become an inseparable part of the modern mathematical physics toolkit for analysis of linear and nonlinear differential equations [\cite=lie1]-[\cite=zhd0]. However, with all its power, versatility and universality the Lie symmetry approach has its limits, which prompted numerous researchers to look for possible generalizations of the concept of classical symmetry in order to be able to handle differential equations that do not possess Lie symmetries.

One of the promising generalizations of the concept of the classical symmetry is allowing for a generalized symmetry to depend on integrals of dependent variables, in contrast to Lie symmetry which can only involve independent, dependent variables and their derivatives. In this way nonlocal symmetries have been introduced into the modern mathematical physics.

There was significant progress in studying nonlocal symmetries of linear differential equations (see, e.g., [\cite=fus1] and the references therein). Much less is known about nonlocal symmetries of nonlinear differential equations.

A possible way to approach the problem of constructing nonlocal symmetries of partial differential equations is utilization of the concept of quasi-local symmetry introduced in [\cite=ibr0] [\cite=puk]. Quasi-local symmetry is the one obtained from a classical Lie symmetry through nonlocal transformation. Another approach is based on the concept of potential symmetry [\cite=blu1]-[\cite=blu3]. However, as we established recently, potential symmetries of evolution type equations are quasi-local ones in a sense that there is a nonlocal transformation reducing those to point or contact symmetries [\cite=zhd1].

The principal motivation for this paper was a need for a more systematic approach to classification of partial differential equations admitting quasi-local symmetries. It is natural to expect that such an approach should rely on Lie symmetries of equations under study. We demonstrate in the paper that it is indeed possible to develop the regular and systematic classification scheme using the results of group classification of nonlinear second-order equations [\cite=zhd2] [\cite=zhd3] and the ideas suggested in [\cite=zhd1] [\cite=sok1].

We utilize the results of group classification of the general second-order evolution equation in one spatial variable

[formula]

to construct nonlocal symmetries of the associated evolution equations. In a what follows, we denote the class of partial differential equations ([\ref=0.1]) as [formula].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give the necessary definitions and present the detailed description of our approach to classifying nonlocal symmetries of ([\ref=0.1]). Section 3 is devoted to application of the approach to equations from [formula] invariant under the Lie algebras of the dimension s  ≤  3. The last section contains brief discussion of the obtained results.

Description of the method

We begin by introducing the differential transformation which plays a key role in our subsequent considerations

[formula]

Note that the inverse of differential transformation ([\ref=1.1]) reads as

[formula]

Hereafter ∂- 1x is the inverse of the differentiation operator ∂x, i.e., [formula].

Consider a subclass of evolution equations of the form ([\ref=0.1])

[formula]

admitting the group of translations by u.

Differentiating ([\ref=1.3]) with respect to x and applying [formula] yields

[formula]

Consequently, [formula] maps a subclass of equations ([\ref=1.3]) from [formula] into another subclass of equations ([\ref=1.4]) from [formula]. Remarkably, this very transformation is responsible for all potential symmetries of equations ([\ref=0.1]) [\cite=zhd1].

Indeed, suppose that ([\ref=1.3]) admits Lie transformation group

[formula]

where θ is the group parameter. Note that ([\ref=1.5]) is the most general one-parameter Lie group that can be admitted by an equation from the class [formula] (see, e.g., [\cite=zhd4]). Computing the first prolongation of formulas ([\ref=1.5]) we derive the transformation rule for the first derivative of u

[formula]

Now the image of transformation group ([\ref=1.4]) under the action of [formula] takes the form

[formula]

with u = ∂- 1x̄ū and U = U(,x̄,u,θ). Consequently, if the right-hand sides of ([\ref=1.6]) contain nonlocal variable u, then ([\ref=1.6]) is nonlocal symmetry of ([\ref=1.3]). According to [\cite=zhd1], transformations ([\ref=1.6]) include the variable u if and only if [formula] or [formula].

Summing up we conclude that provided symmetry group ([\ref=1.5]) of equation ([\ref=1.3]) obeys one of the constraints

[formula]

then [formula] maps this symmetry into nonlocal symmetry ([\ref=1.6]) of equation ([\ref=1.4]). This nonlocal symmetry is called the potential symmetry of ([\ref=1.4]).

Constraints ([\ref=1.7.1]) can be written in terms of the coefficients of the infinitesimal operator of group ([\ref=1.5])

[formula]

If

[formula]

then symmetry S is mapped by [formula] into nonlocal symmetry [\cite=zhd1].

Despite the fact that equation ([\ref=1.3]) is rather particular case of the general evolution equation ([\ref=0.1]), the scheme outlined above provides a very general framework for group classification of nonlocal symmetries.

Let the symbol S stand for the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of differential operators ([\ref=1.8]) and the symbol I stand for the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by the operators of the form

[formula]

As direct computations shows, ⊂  I and ⊂  I, which means that I is the ideal in the Lie algebra S.

If an equation of the form ([\ref=0.1]) possesses Lie symmetry from I, then it can always be reduced to the form ([\ref=1.3]) by a suitable local transformation of variables [\cite=ovs1]. Consequently, the procedure for classification of nonlocal symmetries described above is applicable to any equation from the class [formula] admitting at least one symmetry from I.

In the paper [\cite=zhd1] we suggest a generalization of the potential symmetry approach which allows for the use of more general differential transformations to construct nonlocal symmetries. Our generalization is based on the idea put forward by Sokolov [\cite=sok1]. He suggests that a differential transformation is to be looked for in the form

[formula]

ω1 and ω2 being differential invariants of the symmetry group of the evolution equation under study. For the case when [formula], we have ω1 = x and ω2 = ux, x and ux being the simplest differential invariants of the group of displacements by u generated by the infinitesimal operator ∂u. Evidently, evolution equation ([\ref=1.3]) admits symmetry ∂u. Sokolov proves in [\cite=sok1] that for any contact symmetry of evolution equation of the form ([\ref=0.1]) preserving the temporal variable t the corresponding differential transformation maps equation in question into [formula].

Now we are ready to formulate the group approach to classifying nonlocal symmetries of equations from the class [formula].

Let equation ([\ref=0.1]) be invariant under the r-dimensional Lie algebra [formula]. Next, suppose that Lr contains a subalgebra Is =   [formula], s < r such that Is ⊂   I. Saying it another way, the basis elements of the algebra Is have the form ([\ref=1.9]). Let t,ω1,ω2 be functionally independent differential invariants of Is.

Making differential transformation ([\ref=1.10]) with so chosen ω1,ω2 we map the invariant equation ([\ref=0.1]) into another equation from [formula]. If the transformation group generated by the operators [formula] obeys one of the inequalities ([\ref=1.10]), then its image under the differential transformation [formula] is a nonlocal symmetry of the transformed equation.

Direct application of the transformation of the form ([\ref=0.1]), especially for the case when ω1,ω2 depend on higher derivatives, may become quite challenging computational problem by itself. That is why we suggest a modification of the approach above, which is to represent [formula] as a superposition of elementary differential transformations. These elementary transformations are obtained as a superposition of a local transformation reducing the individual basis operators of the Lie algebra Is to the form ∂u and of the differential transformation [formula].

We begin with the local change of variables, [formula], reducing the first basis operator e1 to the form ∂u and after that we apply the transformation [formula]. Next, we recompute the remaining basis operators in the new variables t,x,ux.

To construct the image of infinitesimal operator ([\ref=1.9]) under the transformation [formula] we compute the coefficient of ∂ux in its first prolongation

[formula]

Next, we replace u with ∂- 1xu and ux with u so that the transformed infinitesimal operator, [formula], takes the form

[formula]

If there is a basis element, ei, which does not depend on the nonlocal variable ∂- 1xu, then we can repeat the procedure and reduce ei to the form ∂u and then apply [formula] and so on.

The above described procedure has two possible outcomes. The first one is when we are able to perform all s steps and get an evolution equation which is the image of the initial Is-invariant equation under transformation ([\ref=1.10]). The resulting differential transformation takes the form

[formula]

Applying [formula] to ([\ref=0.1]) yields the sequence of s evolution equations from the class [formula] together with the sequence of their symmetries, some of which might be nonlocal.

The second outcome is when at some step p  <  s all the remaining basis operators contain the nonlocal variable ∂- 1xu and we cannot proceed any further. In this case we obtain the sequence of transformations

[formula]

that maps the initial Is-invariant evolution equation into equation, which admits at least s - p nonlocal symmetries of the form ([\ref=1.11]).

We summarize the above speculations in the form of the algorithm of classification of evolution equations possessing nonlocal symmetries.

The starting point of our classification algorithm is evolution equation ([\ref=0.1]) invariant under r-dimensional Lie algebra Lr  ⊂  S. Suppose also that the algebra Lr contains a subalgebra Is  ⊂  I of the dimension 1  ≤  s  ≤  r. Now to classify evolution equations admitting nonlocal symmetries one needs to

classify Is-inequivalent subalgebras [formula] of the algebra Is,

compute the sequence of transformations ([\ref=1.12]) mapping the initial invariant equation into [formula] for each subalgebra [formula] and generate the corresponding sequence of evolution equations and their invariance algebras,

verify for each invariance algebra whether its basis elements satisfy one of the inequalities ([\ref=1.7.2]). If this the case, then the remaining elements of the sequence of evolution equations possess nonlocal symmetry.

Upon completing the three steps of the algorithm above ones obtains the set of evolution equations ([\ref=0.1]) that admit nonlocal symmetries.

Applications

In [\cite=zhd2] [\cite=zhd3] [\cite=zhd4] we obtain exhaustive description of inequivalent Lie algebras, which are symmetry algebras of equations of the form ([\ref=0.1]). This fact facilitates application of the algorithm presented in the previous section in its full generality. However, in this paper we restrict our considerations to subalgebras of the symmetry algebra of ([\ref=0.1]) of the dimension s  ≤  3.

The list of inequivalent realizations of one-dimensional symmetry algebras of equation ([\ref=0.1]) consists of one representative

[formula]

This case has already been considered in the previous section, the algebra A1 giving rise to the transformation [formula].

According to [\cite=zhd4] the class of operators, I, contains four inequivalent realizations of two-dimensional symmetry algebras of ([\ref=0.1]). These realizations are listed below together with the corresponding invariant equations

[formula]

We start by analyzing differential transformations associated with the algebra A12. Applying the transformation [formula] to the equation ut  =  f(t,ux,uxx) we get

[formula]

where f = f(t,u,ux). Note that we dropped the bars.

The second basis operator of A12 reads now as ∂x. To reduce it to the the form ∂u we apply the hodograph transformation

[formula]

The transformed equations has the form

[formula]

where [formula]. Applying the transformation [formula], yields the final form of the transformed evolution equation

[formula]

Here [formula].

Turn now to the algebra A22. Applying the transformation [formula] to the invariant equation ut  =  f(t,x,uxx) yields

[formula]

with f = f(t,x,ux). As usual we drop the bars. The second basis element of A22 takes the form ∂u and we can directly apply the transformation [formula] thus getting

[formula]

Consider next the algebra A32. Applying the transformation [formula] to the equation ut  =  xf(t,ux,xuxx) we have

[formula]

with [formula]. The second basis operator of the algebra A32 reads now as x∂x. Applying the hodograph type local transformation

[formula]

we reduce it to the form ∂u. Transforming equation ([\ref=3.2]) accordingly we get

[formula]

where [formula]. Now we can apply the transformation [formula] thus getting

[formula]

with [formula].

Finally, we turn to the algebra A42. Applying the transformation [formula] to the invariant equation ut  =  uxf(t,x,u- 1xuxx) yields

[formula]

where [formula]. The second basis element of the algebra A42 is still of the form u∂u, so we need to reduce it to the form ∂u. To this end, we perform the local transformation

[formula]

As a result, ([\ref=3.4]) takes the form

[formula]

with [formula]. Applying the transformation [formula] finally yields

[formula]

where f = f(t,x,u).

Summing up we present the four sequences of differential transformations that map four subclasses of the class of second-order evolution equations [formula] into [formula].

Differential transformation [formula] maps equation

[formula]

into

[formula]

with [formula].

Differential transformation [formula] maps equation

[formula]

into

[formula]

with f  =  f(t,x,u).

Differential transformation [formula] maps equation

[formula]

into

[formula]

with f  =  f(t,z1,z2)  =  f(t,x,u- 1).

Differential transformation [formula] maps equation

[formula]

into

[formula]

In the above formulas the transformations [formula] are given by ([\ref=3.1]), ([\ref=3.2]) and ([\ref=3.5]), respectively.

The class of first-order differential operators I contains twenty two inequivalent realizations of three-dimensional symmetry algebras of ([\ref=0.1]) [\cite=zhd4]. These realizations are listed below together with the corresponding invariant equations.

[formula]

Analysis of the sequences of differential transformations associated with the above algebras is similar to the case of two-dimensional algebras. We skip the derivation details and give the final result, the differential transformations ([\ref=1.12]), ([\ref=1.13]).

For the algebras A13 - A63, A103 - A143 The sequence of transformations [formula] reads as

[formula]

where

[formula]

Now if an equation invariant under one of the algebras from the list A13 - A63, A103 - A143 admits additional Lie symmetry satisfying ([\ref=1.7.2]), then every member of the sequence of equations obtained by successive application of transformations [formula] possesses nonlocal symmetry. Moreover, if we are able to construct an exact solution of some equation from the sequence, we can map this solution into solutions of the remaining equations from the sequence.

For the algebras A73 - A93, A153 - A183, and A203 - A223 the algorithm stops after the second iteration, since the third symmetry operator turns into a nonlocal one. Below we give the corresponding sequences of transformations.

[formula]

where

[formula]

Applying the above sequences of transformations to the corresponding invariant equations yield evolution equations of the form ([\ref=0.1]) that admit nonlocal symmetries. The explicit form of those symmetries is very cumbersome, therefore we present the nonlocal symmetries obtained through the action of [formula] only. In addition, we give the corresponding transformed equations.

[formula]

Here v  =  ∂- 1xu is the nonlocal variable.

Finally, when computing transformations associated with the algebra A193 we have to stop after the first iteration, since the second and third basis operators are mapped by [formula] into nonlocal symmetries

[formula]

where v  =  ∂- 1xu. So that the sequence of differential transformations boils down to a single transformation [formula]. And what is more, the evolution equation invariant under the nonlocal symmetries e2 and e3 reads as

[formula]

with

[formula]

Let us emphasize that symmetries ([\ref=3.7]), ([\ref=3.8]) contain nonlocal variable and, consequently, cannot be obtained within the framework of the traditional infinitesimal Lie method.

Concluding Remarks

We develop the regular method for group classification of evolution equations admitting nonlocal symmetries. The starting point of the method is an evolution equation that possesses nontrivial Lie symmetry. The source of nonlocal symmetries are classical symmetries subjected to nonlocal transformations.

One of the by-products of our approach are the sequences of evolution equations related to the initial invariant equation. So that if we succeed in constructing a (general or particular) solution of the sequence member then it is possible to map this solution into solutions of the remaining equations from the sequence.

Of special interest is the case when one of the members of the sequence is the linear evolution equation, since this means that the remaining equations are linearizable. Moreover, a direct application of the method to linear evolution equations admitting nontrivial Lie symmetries is also of importance, since it yields sequences of linearizable evolution equations.

These and related problems are under study now and will be reported elsewhere.
