A new look at Condition A

Introduction

An isoparametric hypersurface M in the sphere Sn is one whose principal curvatures and their multiplicities are fixed. We shall not dwell on the history and development of the beautiful isoparametric story, and shall leave it to, e.g., [\cite=CCJ], and the references therein. Through Münzner's work [\cite=M] one knows that such a hypersurface can be characterized by a homogeneous polynomial [formula] of degree g = 1,2,3,4 or 6, satisfying

[formula]

for two natural numbers m1 and m2. The interpretation of m1 and m2 is that if we arrange the principal curvatures [formula] with multiplicities [formula], respectively, then mi = mi + 2 with index mod (g); therefore, which one is m1 or m2 is only a matter of convention, by changing F to - F if necessary. F is called the Cartan-Münzner polynomial, whose restriction f to Sn has values in the interval

[formula]

The octonian algebra and Clifford representations

Let [formula] be the quaternion algebra with the standard basis 1,i,j,k. The octonian algebra [formula] is [formula] with the multiplication

[formula]

where overline denotes quaternionic conjugation. For [formula], the conjugate of x is [formula], and the real and imaginary parts of x are [formula], respectively. The inner product

[formula]

satisfies

[formula]

In particular, first of all, the above formulae are the rules to follow when we interchange two objects in the octonian multiplication. Secondly, when x and y are perpendicular and purely imaginary in [formula], they satisfy

[formula]

for all [formula]. As a consequence of [\eqref=eq0], if we let [formula] the standard orthonormal basis

[formula]

gives rise to orthogonal matrices [formula] over [formula], where Ji(z) = eiz,1  ≤  i  ≤  7, such that

[formula]

Similarly, the orthogonal matrices [formula], where Ji'(z) = zei, satisfies

[formula]

Recall [\cite=H] that the Clifford algebra Cn (respectively, Cn') is the algebra over [formula] generated by [formula] subject to only the conditions that (Ei)2 =  - 1 (respectively, (Ei)2 = 1) and EiEj =  - EjEi for i  ≠  j. The structure of Cn (respectively, Cn', to be displayed later) is well known [\cite=H],

subject to the periodicity condition [formula], of which the most important ones for our purposes are [formula] the matrix ring of size 8-by-8 over [formula], and [formula]. The generators [formula] projected to each irreducible summand of Cn,n = 2,3,6,7, give rise to n matrices [formula] in [formula] for C2 and C3, and in [formula] for C6 and C7, satisfying (Ti)2 =  - Id and TiTj =  - TjTi for i  ≠  j. These Ti make [formula] and [formula] into irreducible Cn-modules. For n = 2,6, there is only one such irreducible module as the number of irreducible summands of Cn is one, whereas for n = 3,7, there are two inequivalent such irreducible modules as the number of irreducible summands of Cn is two. [formula] are called representations of Cn on the appropriate Euclidean spaces.

The upshot is that the octonian (respectively, quaternionic) left and right multiplications generated above, i.e., [formula] vs. [formula] (respectively, J1,J2,J3 vs. J1',J2',J3') are precisely the inequivalent representations of C7 on [formula] (respectively, C3 on [formula]). These two representations are inequivalent as [formula] whereas [formula] (respectively, J1J2J3 =  - Id whereas J1'J2'J3' = Id).

Now the subalgebra of C7 linearly spanned by the even products of the Clifford generators is isomorphic to [formula] having a single irreducible summand. We see [formula] and [formula] are equivalent representations of C6. That is, there is an orthogonal matrix U over [formula] such that U- 1JiJ7U = Ji'J7' for 1  ≤  i  ≤  6. A similar discussion also holds true for [formula] by forgetting [formula], since [formula]. As an application, we prove the following to be employed later.

Let m = 3,7. Let Aa,1  ≤  a  ≤  m, be (m + 1)-by-(m + 1) matrices satisfying

[formula]

Then there are two orthogonal matrices P,Q∈O(m + 1) for which Ea: = P- 1AaQ satisfy Em = Id, and for 1  ≤  a,b  ≤  m - 1,

[formula]

Clearly we can find two orthogonal matrices P and Q such that P- 1AmQ = Id. (Take, e.g., P = Id and Q = (Am)- 1.) Set a = m. Then [\eqref=eq'] reduces to

[formula]

for 1  ≤  b  ≤  m - 1. This says exactly that Eb,1  ≤  b  ≤  m - 1, are orthogonal matrices satisfying (Eb)2 =  - Id and EbEc =  - EcEb for 1  ≤  b  ≠  c  ≤  m - 1.

Conditions and notations as in Lemma [\ref=lm], then we may pick orthogonal P and Q so that Aa = PJaQ- 1,1  ≤  a  ≤  m.

As mentioned earlier C6 is generated by [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], we know all the Clifford representations are equivalent. Thus, there is an O∈O(m + 1) such that Ea = OJaJmO- 1 for 1  ≤  a  ≤  m - 1. Changing the P and Q in the above lemma to PO and QO, we may assume now that Ea = JaJm,1  ≤  a  ≤  m - 1. But then changing the (new) P to PJ- 1m, we see that we may assume Eb = Jb for 1  ≤  b  ≤  m.

Recall [\cite=H] that a binary operation [formula] defined on [formula] is called an orthogonal multiplication if [formula] for all [formula]. Let [formula] be the standard basis of [formula]. We say [formula] is normalized if [formula] for all [formula]; we call [formula] a normed algebra. It is well known that if [formula] is normalized, then the orthogonal maps [formula] satisfy UiUj + UjUi =  - 2δijId for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  m. In particular, [formula] is a Cm-module, which is the case only when m = 1,3,7. Conversely, if we have such Ui,1  ≤  i  ≤  m, we let U0 = Id, then [formula], extended by linearity, gives a normalized orthogonal multiplication with [formula] for all x. We identify [formula] with [formula] or [formula] respectively, for m = 1,3,7.

Notation as above, for all z, then there is an orthogonal transformation T such that

[formula]

for 1  ≤  a  ≤  m and for all z in the normed algebra; moreover, there is a unit vector α such that T(z) = zα in the former case, or T(z) = αz in the latter. It follows that

[formula]

in the former case, or

[formula]

in the latter. In particular, [\eqref=eq-2] and [\eqref=eq-1] remain true for [formula].

Let [formula]. There is an orthogonal matrix T such that either Ua = TJaT- 1, or Ua = TJa'T- 1,1  ≤  a  ≤  m. The first statement follows.

To prove the second statement, we may assume [formula] without loss of generality. Then by the first statement just estblished, we obtain

[formula]

so that

[formula]

In particular, setting α: = T(e0) we derive

[formula]

But then the identity [formula] implies

[formula]

so that when we set [formula] we dedece

[formula]

for all u,w. That is, T(w) = wα.

In particular, in the former case without loss of generality, we obtain

[formula]

It follows by the associativity of [formula] that [formula] or = yx for all [formula].

Now decompose α as

[formula]

for some θ and some purely imaginary unit e.

We assume [formula]. When orthonormal [formula] are such that (ab)e =   ±  e0, then [formula]. On the other hand, when a,b and ab are all perpendicular to e, we have

[formula]

We assume ab = e without loss of generality. Then [formula], so that

[formula]

When a,b, and ab are all perpendicular to e, we observe first that

[formula]

so that

[formula]

In passing, let us briefly remark that the table for Cn',

subject to the periodicity condition [formula], gives that the dimension of an irreducible module of the Clifford algebra C'm + 1,m  ≥  1, is 2δ(m), where δ(m) is the dimension of an irreducible module of Cm - 1. We have δ(m + 8) = 16δ(m) and δ(m) = 1,2,4,4,8,8,8,8 for [formula], respectively.

The expansion formula of Ozeki and Takeuchi

Let M be an isoparametric hypersurface with four principal curvatures in the sphere. To fix our notation, we let V+,V- and V0 be the eigenspaces of the shape operator of M+ in the normal direction [formula] associated with the eigenvalues 1, - 1 and 0, of dimension m2,m2,m1, respectively. Let us agree that objects of these eigenspaces are indexed by α,μ and p, respectively, so that, typical vectors (coordinates) of V+,V- and V0 are denoted by eα,eμ,ep (xα,yμ,zp), respectively, etc.

With this understood, the 2nd fundamental matrices Sa of M+ in the normal direction [formula], upon fixing orthonormal bases eα,eμ,ep, are

[formula]

where Aa:V-  →  V+, Ba:V0  →  V+ and Ca:V0  →  V-.

Ozeki and Takeuchi [\cite=OT] obtained the expansion formula for the Cartan-Münzner polynomial F of M as follows.

[formula]

Here, x is a point on M+, y is tangent to M+ at x, and w is normal to M+ with coordinates wi with respect to the chosen orthonormal normal basis [formula] at x. Moreover, pa(y) (respectively, qa(y)) is the ath component of the 2nd (respectively, 3rd) fundamental form of M+ at x. Furthermore, pa and qa are subject to ten equations [\cite=OT], of which the first three assert that, since [formula], the 2nd fundamental matrix of M+ in any unit normal direction [formula], has eigenvalues 1, - 1,0 with fixed multiplicities, it must be that [formula]. From this we can derive [\cite=OT]

[formula]

for a  ≠  b.

A point x∈M+ is said to be of Condition A [\cite=OT] if the kernel of [formula] is V0 for all [formula], which amounts to the same as saying the matrices Ba = Ca = 0 for all 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1 in [\eqref=2nd], so that [\eqref=eq0.6] now reads

[formula]

for 1  ≤  a  ≠  b  ≤  m1. It follows that the symmetric 2nd fundamental matrices Sa,0  ≤  a  ≤  m1, satisfy

[formula]

when they are restricted to [formula]. In other words, [\eqref=eq0.8] asserts that [formula] is a C'm1 + 1-module. Hence, by the passing remark at the end of the preceding section, we see m2 = kδ(m1) for some k; thus among (m1,m2) = (2,2),(4,5),(5,4), only the first is possible. (In fact, Ozeki and Takeuchi established, in their outline [\cite=OT] of the classification of the (2,2) case that had been indicated by Cartan without proof [\cite=C], that Condition A holds on one of the focal submanifolds.) But then the multiplicity formula m1 + m2 + 1 = sδ(m1) for some s, with (m1,m2)  ≠  (2,2),(4,5),(5,4), implies m1 + 1 = (s - k)δ(m1), so that m1 = 1,3 or 7. In particular, for m1 = 3 or 7 we always have m2  ≥  2(m1 + 1) when m2  ≠  m1 + 1, whereas clearly m2  ≥  2m1 - 1 for m1 = 1; therefore, by the result in [\cite=CCJ] M is of the type of multiplicity (m1,m2) constructed by Ozeki and Takeuchi [\cite=OT] when either m1 = 1 or m2  ≠  m1 + 1.

Thus from now on, we assume m2 = m1 + 1 with m1 = 3,7. Then [\eqref=eq0.7] and Corollary [\ref=cor] give the following.

At a point x∈M+ of Condition A we may assume, by picking appropriate bases for V+ and V-, that Aa = Ja,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1.

The matrices P and Q are for the basis changes in V+ and V-.

Mirror points on M+ and M-

Assume Condition A at x∈M+ when (m1,m2) = (3,4) or (7,8). As above, let [formula] be an orthonormal normal basis at x. We decompose the tangent space to M+ at x into the eigenspaces V+,V-,V0, with coordinates xα,yμ,zp as aforementioned, of the shape operator [formula]. Traversing along the great circle spanned by x and [formula] by length π / 2, we end up again on M+ at [formula] with x as a normal vector. Accordingly, set [formula] and [formula] normal to M+ at x#. Then the eigenspaces V#+,V#-,V#0 of [formula] with eigenvalues 1, - 1,0 are [\cite=CCJ], respectively, [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is the normal space to M+ at x#.

x#∈M+ is also of condition A.

Although a straightforward proof can be given by the formulae on page 15 of [\cite=CCJ], we choose to give one based on the expansion formula [\eqref=eq0.0]. Since x is of Condition A, we know pa,0  ≤  a  ≤  m1, are quadratic forms in xα and yμ only. If we denote, at x#, all the involved quantities in [\eqref=eq0.0] with an additional #, then [formula]. The 3rd term of [\eqref=eq0.0] at x#, which is

[formula]

is what determines the 2nd fundamental form at x#.

One obtains p#0 = p0 by the fact that p0w0t = p0w#0t#, which is part of the 3rd term of [\eqref=eq0.0] at x, and no other terms contribute w0t of the 1st degree. Furthermore, expanding 8q0w0 in [formula], we have

[formula]

where [formula] are quadratic forms only in xα and yμ, because q0 is homogeneous of degree 1 in all xα,yμ,zp [\cite=OT]. No other terms of [\eqref=eq0.0] contribute [formula] of the 1st degree. It follows that [formula]. Hence, x# is of condition A as well.

In [\eqref=2nd], we use an additional # to indicate the corresponding quantities in the 2nd fundamental matrices at x#.

Actually, Lemma  [\ref=mirror] proves more. It shows that in fact q0 determines A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, whose entries are the coefficients of Ha / 2,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1.

Next, let

[formula]

Then x*∈M-. We decompose the tangent space to M- at x* into the eigenspaces V*+,V*-,V*0, of the shape operator [formula] with eigenvalues 1, - 1,0, respectively. Again, we use an additional * to denote all involved quantities at x*.

We have

where 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1 + 1,m1 = 3,7, and B*a (respectively,  C*a) is the m1-by-(m1 + 1) matrix formed by stacking together, in order, the ath row of each of the m1 matrices [formula] [formula] at x (respectively,  at  x#).

Again we explore [\eqref=eq0.0] with a slight modification. Namely, since [\eqref=eq0.0] is with respect to M+ while x*∈M-, we must consider the expansion of - F at x* in order to apply [\eqref=eq0.0]. From the definition of x* and [formula], we see [formula] and [formula].

The collection of (t*)2 terms for - F will reveal the tangent and normal space at x*. But these terms come from the first two terms, 8p0w0t, - 6|y|2(w0)2,|w|4 and [formula] in the expansion of F. As a result, the 2nd term in the expansion of - F at x* is

[formula]

where as before xα,yμ,zp,wa parametrize V+,V-,V0 and the normal space to M+ at x. On the other hand, the collection of w*0t*, which comes from the same terms, gives p*0 so that we end up with

[formula]

Hence, the first statement follows.

The collection of the terms [formula], with coefficients being quadratic forms in yμ,zp,wa,a  ≥  1, gives rise to the 2nd fundamental form of M- at x*. But these terms come only from [formula] obtained by the third term of [\eqref=eq0.0], and from [formula] obtained by the eighth term in [\eqref=eq0.0]. Combining them yields, by [\eqref=eq000],

[formula]

where [formula] This is the 2nd statement, where the negative sign accounts for considering - F at x*.

Recall by Corollary [\ref=cor1] we may assume Aa = Ja,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, at a point x of Condition A. We now understand the structure of A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1.

Let [formula] be the standard basis of [formula] or [formula]. Then < A#a(e0),e0 >  = 0 for all 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1. In particular, we may assume A#a(e0) = ea for all 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1; as a result, (A#a)tr(e0) =  - ea. It follows that we may further assume that A#a are skew-symmetric, i.e., that A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, form a Clifford system.

Since Aa = Ja,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, the second item in Lemma [\ref=lemma1] says that the ath column of B*a is zero, 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1. Now, the third equation of [\eqref=eq0.6] applied to the point x*∈M- says

[formula]

which implies that the ath column of C*a is also zero, 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, when we set a = b in the equation. Equivalently, this means the diagonal of A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, is zero. So,

[formula]

Since va: = A#a(e0),1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, are perpendicular to each other by the third equation of [\eqref=eq0.7] and Lemma [\ref=mirror], we deduce therefore that va,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, span [formula]. Thus, there is an orthogonal matrix [formula] of size m1-by-m1 such that [formula] The matrices [formula], which are the A-blocks of the 2nd fundamental matrices corresponding to the new normal basis [formula] at x#∈M+, will serve as the new A#a mapping e0 to ea. Thus without loss of generality we may now assume A#a(e0) = ea,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1.

In coordinates, [\eqref=needed] assumes the form

[formula]

Hence, if we pick α  =  μ = 0 and β  =  ν = a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, we see by the fact that Aa = Ja,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, that the product of the (a,0)-entry and the (0,a)-entry of A#a is - 1, so that the latter is - 1 since the former is 1. This forces all other entries of the first row of A#a to be zero as A#a is orthogonal. In conclusion, (A#a)tr(e0) =  - ea. That is, A#a is skew-symmetric in the first row and column, 1  ≤  a  ≤  m1.

Since A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, leave [formula] invariant and since the group of automorphism of [formula] and [formula], which are SO(3) and G2, respectively, are transitive on the unit sphere of [formula], we see that any purely imaginary unit vector e can serve as e1. Therefore, < A#a(e),e >  = 0 by [\eqref=AS]. It follows that A#a restricted on [formula] is also skew-symmetric. In particular, [\eqref=eq0.7] says that A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, form a Clifford system.

For notational ease, we let A#0 = Id. We define a normalized orthogonal multiplication [formula] on [formula] by [formula] for 0  ≤  a,b  ≤  m1, and extend it by linearity.

We can now determine the 2nd fundamental form at x*∈M-.

For (m1,m2) = (7,8), the 2nd fundamental form [formula] at x*∈M- is given by

[formula]

for a tangent vector [formula] at x*, where [formula]), the purely imaginary part of [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] lives in the normal space to M-, which is [formula].

For (m1,m2) = (3,4), one has the same formula by forgetting the orthogonal complement of [formula] in [formula].

It is an immediate consequence of < B*a(ep),eα >  =  < eαep,ea  >   and [formula].

Henceforth, we will mainly study the structure of isoparametric hypersurfaces in the case when (m1,m2) = (7,8).

Octonian realization of the isoparametric hypersurfaces of OT-FKM type

Isoparametric hypersurfaces constructed by Ferus Karcher and Münzner

Let [formula] be the direct sum of four copies of [formula]. We identify (0,0, - e0,0) with x∈M+; [formula] with V0 = V*-; (0,e0,0,0) with [formula]; and [formula] with V*+. We identify V- = V*0 with [formula] and identify V+, which is the normal subspace perpendicular to [formula] at x*, with (W,0,0, - W). The notation here is in accordance with Lemma [\ref=lemma1] and Proposition [\ref=ppp2].

Consider the orthogonal transformations

[formula]

for 0  ≤  a  ≤  7. It is immediate that PiPj + PjPi = 2δijId, - 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  7. Therefore, the symmetric Clifford system [formula] over M- generates an isoparametric hypersurface M constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner [\cite=DN2], [\cite=FKM].

It is readily checked that

[formula]

and < P- 1((Z,X,Y,Z)),(Z,X,Y,Z) >  =  - |X|2 + |Y|2. That is, rescaling Z, - Pi, - 1  ≤  i  ≤  7, restricted to the tangent space to M- at x* give exactly the 2nd fundamental form by Proposition [\ref=ppp2].

Recall M- is said to be of Condition B [\cite=OT] at x* if

[formula]

where rab =  - rba, - 1  ≤  a,b  ≤  m1; here, we set q*- 1 = 0 and p*- 1 = |X|2 - |Y|2. An isoparametric hypersurface of OT-FKM type satisfies Condition B; it is well known [\cite=FKM] that

[formula]

where v is tangent to the focal submanifold, which is M- in our case, defined by the symmetric Clifford matrices Pa as the zero locus of < Pa(x),x >  = 0, - 1  ≤  a  ≤  7, and na are the normal basis elements. With [formula] and v = X + Y + Z, it is straightforward to find [formula] and so

[formula]

for a tangent vector [formula] at x*, in the case of isoparametric hypersurfaces constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner.

Perturbing the mirror point x*

There is a point x* on M- of the isoparametric hypersurfaces constructed by Ferus Karcher and Münzner at which either [formula] or [formula] for all [formula], up to an isometry of the ambient Euclidean space.

Similar to Lemma [\ref=QS] we can apply an orthogonal transformation U such that

[formula]

for all a,z. With x# = (0,e0,0,0) and [formula] for n =  - U(e0), the normal space to M- at [formula] is spanned by

[formula]

whereas the tangent vectors, being perpendicular to [formula] and the normal vectors, are thus of the form (Z,X,U(Y),U(Z)); therefore,

[formula]

for 0  ≤  a  ≤  7, give that the 2nd fundamental form at [formula] is [formula], or [formula] after rescaling Z.

Isoparametric hypersurfaces of the type constructed by Ozeki and Takeuchi

Let [formula] be identified as the direct sum of four copies of [formula]. Let x = (0,0,e0,0) and at x identify V+ as the first copy, V- as the second copy and the normal space as the fourth copy of [formula] in [formula]. Lastly, identify the imaginary part of the third copy of [formula] as V0 at x. Define

[formula]

for 1  ≤  a  ≤  7. A calculation similar to the above one gives that the symmetric Clifford system [formula] over M+ defines an isoparametric hypersurface M, where x∈M+ is of Condition A whose 2nd fundamental form is

[formula]

In particular, the orthogonal multiplication [formula] at x# coincides with the octonian multiplication. By [\cite=OT], [\cite=FKM], we know x is also of Condition B. Indeed, with the normal basis nb = (0,0,0,eb) and a tangent vector x = (u,v,z,0), where [formula] and [formula], we calculate by [\eqref=CondB] to deduce r0b =  < z,eb > ,1  ≤  b  ≤  7 and rab =  -  < eaz,eb > ,0  ≤  a  ≠  b  ≤  7. From this we obatin by [\eqref=B]

[formula]

for 1  ≤  a  ≤  7 [\cite=OT].

Since q0 gives A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  7, by Remark [\ref=rmk], we see Aa = A#a = Ja,1  ≤  a  ≤  7. On the other hand, Remark [\ref=quote], to be given later, gives that

[formula]

with [formula]. The identification [formula], and W = u in the normal space to x*∈M- derives that, for a tangent vector [formula] and a normal vector W at x*,

[formula]

We thus arrive at

[formula]

for a tangent vector [formula] at x*. The fact that the 3rd fundamental form at x of Condition A in the example of Ozeki and Takeuchi is not linear in all variables whereas the 3rd fundamental form is linear at x*, in the cases of both Ozeki-Takeuchi and Ferus-Karcher-Münzner, in all variables points to that it will be simpler to look at the mirror point x* instead.

The 3rd fundamental form at a mirror point on M-

Henceforth, we concentrate on x*∈M-. It is understood (m1,m2) = (7,8). In coordinate calculations we use x*α,y*μ,z*p to denote coordinates of V*+,V*-,V*0, respectively, so that [formula], [formula], and [formula]. We identify a normal vector perpendicular to [formula] with [formula].

At x*∈M-, we have q*0 = 0.

This follows from Remark [\ref=rmk]. There, we see that q0 at x∈M+ determines A#a,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, and vice versa. Hence, if Aa = 0,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, then [\eqref=eq0.9] derives that A#a = 0,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1, so that q0 = 0. Now replace F by - F and x# by x* and observe that A*a = 0,1  ≤  a  ≤  m1 by the second item of Lemma [\ref=lemma1].

Now that q*0 = 0, there will be no confusion for us to change our notation from now on to rename [formula], where m2 = m1 + 1, at x* to be [formula], so that the 3rd fundamental form can be written as [formula] in accordance with the standard octonian basis [formula].

At x*∈M-, the 3rd fundamental form [formula] satisfies

[formula]

for a tangent vector [formula] at x*.

Recall the identity for an isoparametric hypersurface [\cite=OT]

[formula]

where [formula], that an isoparametric hypersurface must satisfy. It is understood that p*- 1 = |X|2 - |Y|2.

For the isoparametric hypersurfaces of the type constructed by Ferus Karcher and Münzner, we know the left hand side of [\eqref=Defining] is [formula] by [\eqref=3rdf] . On the other hand, the right hand side of [\eqref=Defining] depends only on the 2nd fundamental form, which is exactly [formula] for the type constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner by [\eqref=2ndfund] and in general by Proposition [\ref=ppp2].

When m1 = 1, the underlying normed algebra is [formula]. Therefore, Lemma  [\ref=sub] implies [formula].

When m1 = 2, Ozeki and Takeuchi established [\cite=OT] that one can choose appropriate coordinates so that [formula] is identical with that of the homogeneous example. The same argument as in Lemma  [\ref=sub] then implies that [formula] as it is so for the homogeneous example [\cite=OT], so that the isoparamentric hypersurface is exactly the homogeneous one.

For 0  ≤  a  ≤  m1 at x*, we have [formula] for some coefficients qαμpa. That is, [formula] is homogeneous of degree 1 in X,Y,Z.

We record the equation from Ozeki and Takeuchi [\cite=OT], with respect to - F, that

[formula]

for all - 1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  m1. Picking i =  - 1 and j = a, we get

[formula]

since q*- 1 = 0 by Lemma [\ref=lemma2]. Note that [formula]

For the component [formula] of q*a, where α,β are in the same index range over V*+, the left hand side of [\eqref=eq2] gives [formula] (Euler's identity for homogeneous polynomials). Similarly for the component [formula] where p,q are in the same index range over V*0, the left hand side of [\eqref=eq2] derives [formula] etc. The vanishing of the right hand side of [\eqref=eq2] therefore shows that all those components, exactly two of whose coordinates are in the same index range, are zero. The same reasoning gives zero to the components whose coordinates are either all in the α-range, or all in the μ-range (over V*-). The only component of repeated ranges not accounted for by this procedure is thus of the form [formula] with p,q,r in the same index range. However, Lemma 15 (i) of [\cite=OT] asserts that such components cannot exist.

[formula] at x*∈M- is determined by collecting the part of [formula] at x∈M+ linear in all variables. Explicitly, since [formula] is of degree 1 in X,Y,Z, the term [formula] is of the form [formula], which is also linear in xα,yμ,zp,wa. This is because by our convention, xα,yμ,zp,wa parametrize, respectively, V+,V-,V0 and the normal space to x∈M+; we know by the first item of Lemma  [\ref=lemma1] that x*α = wα,y*μ = zμ,1  ≤  α,μ  ≤  m1, and z*p = xp,w*a = xa,0  ≤  a,p  ≤  m1. However, a glance at [\eqref=eq0.0] shows that the only term of F that contributes to items linear in xα,yμ,zp,wa comes from [formula].

We denote [formula] by [formula], where X∈V*+,Y∈V*- and Z∈V*0; thanks to Proposition [\ref=3.4-5] we see that [formula] is a multilinear form in X,Y,Z. We extend [formula] by requiring that [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. This is well-defined as the right hand side of [\eqref=sub'] is 0 if either X = e0 or Y = e0. With this extension [\eqref=sub'] continues to hold.

For 0  ≤  a,p  ≤  m1 and [formula], we have

[formula]

Setting i = a,j = b in [\eqref=defining'] and considering the homogeneous part in Y and Z only, we obtain

[formula]

Equivalently, it is

[formula]

Setting q = a = b in [\eqref=identity4], we see the first and the third sums on the left are 0, since they are simplified to < q*(e0,Y,ep),ea  >  . Hence we obtain [formula] where eα is parallel to [formula] for any p. Since [formula] runs through [formula] when we vary p, we see [formula] for all α. That is,

[formula]

for all X,Y,ea. In particular, the first identity of [\eqref=identity1] is true.

On the other hand, setting a = b and p = q = 0 we deduce the identity [formula] for all a, which implies that

[formula]

for all [formula], because any unit imaginary X can serve as ea, for some a  ≠  0, since the group of automorphism of the normed algebra is transitive on the unit imaginary sphere. It follows from [\eqref=identity2], [\eqref=identity5] for a = 0, and [formula] that [formula] for all [formula]. Hence, the second identity of [\eqref=identity1] is true.

The third identity of [\eqref=identity1] follows from setting a = b and q = 0.

The fifth identity comes from setting p = b and q = 0 and employing [\eqref=identity5].

The fourth and sixth identities are derived from an equation similar to [\eqref=identity4] when, in [\eqref=defining'], we look at the homogeneous part in X and Z only.

For [formula],

[formula]

It follows from the identities, in order, of Lemma [\ref=imp] and the transitivity of the automorphism group of [formula] on its imaginary unit sphere.

In fact, we can strengthen the first identity of Corollary [\ref=class] as follows.

[formula]

where [formula] and V is either e0 or purely imaginary. In particular, [formula] is skew-symmetric for Z and W in [formula]. Moreover, [formula] is skew-symmetric in all [formula].

Setting p = q in [\eqref=identity4], we obtain

[formula]

The first statement follows.

Setting U = e0 and [formula] for a purely imaginary V, we obtain

[formula]

where the last equality follows from the fifth identity of Corollary [\ref=class].

The second statement is a consequence of [\eqref=import'] and the first identity of Corollary [\ref=class], which says that [formula] is skew-symmetric in Z and W when Z and W are purely imaginary.

The third statement follows from anti-symmetrizing the X and Y slots of the two equations, respectively, of the second identity of Corollary [\ref=class].

For [formula], we have

[formula]

so that anti-symmetrizing we get

[formula]

for [formula].

Setting U = XW for [formula], we derive from [\eqref=import]

[formula]

We next calculate [formula] for a purely imaginary W. By the skew symmetry of [formula] for all [formula],

[formula]

which cancels [formula] for an imaginary W. Putting all these together, it follows that

[formula]

for all [formula].

Likewise, [formula] for all [formula] by a similar argument.

In fact, the first two identities of Corollary  [\ref=anti] establish that [formula] by [\eqref=2fndtl]. This is the seventh of the ten equations of Ozeki and Takeuchi [\cite=OT] defining an isoparametric hypersurface.

We now come to a crucial observation. Recall the angle θ given before Lemma [\ref=comparison].

Assume θ  ≠  0 and π. Let [formula]. Then

[formula]

if e is perpendicular to X,Y and XY, while

[formula]

if XY is parallel to e.

By Lemma [\ref=sub] we see [formula], so that R(Z,W) is skew-symmetric in Z and W.

We may assume [formula] are orthonormal vectors such that X,Y and XY are all perpendicular to e, where e is given before Lemma [\ref=comparison]. Then e0,X,Y,XY,e,Xe,Ye,(XY)e form an octonian basis of [formula]. It follows that R(X,Y) is a linear combination of the above basis elements. We know

[formula]

by the first two identities of Corollary [\ref=class]. Therefore, we conclude

[formula]

for some functions a,b,c,d,f on M.

Let X = g- 1(X'),Y = g- 1(Y') and e = g- 1(e') for any automorphism g of [formula]. Then

[formula]

The interpretation is that (g  ·  R)(X',Y') is R(X,Y) relative to the new octonian basis [formula] with coordinates X',Y' and e'. Since any such (X,Y,e) can be (g- 1(X'),g- 1(Y'),g- 1(e')) for a fixed (X',Y',e') (think of it as (e1,e2,e4)) as we vary g, we see that a,b,c,d,f are all constant. But then homogenizing X and Y in [\eqref=inv] shows that c = d = 0 for (polynomial) degree reason, and, moreover, that f = 0 since R(X,Y) is skew-symmetric. So now

[formula]

To determine a and b, we note that by Lemma [\ref=AI]

[formula]

is skew-symmetric in all variables. Hence the 3rd identity of Corollary [\ref=class] gives

[formula]

while the 4th identity of Corollary [\ref=class] gives

[formula]

Adding these two equations, incorporating Lemma [\ref=comparison] and bearing in mind that a =  < R(X,Y),XY >  and b =  < R(X,Y),(XY)e > , we obtain

[formula]

But then

[formula]

results in

[formula]

(The signs for a and b agree.) By changing e to - e, we may assume the sign is positive. It follows that

[formula]

In the case when the orthonormal imaginary X and Y are such that XY = e, we form an octonian basis e0,X,Y,e,W,WX,WY,We. We have, since [formula] by Lemma [\ref=comparison] and since R(X,Y) is skew-symmetric, that

[formula]

by the previous case. In other words, R(X,Y) is in the span of e0 and e since < R(X,Y),X >  =  < R(X,Y),Y >  = 0. Write

[formula]

Now, b =  < R(X,Y),e0 >  = 0 by skew symmetry. Moreover, since [formula], we see a =   ±  2 and

[formula]

R(X,Y) = XY - YX if θ = 0 and R(X,Y) = 0 if θ  =  π.

e is arbitrary in [\eqref=great] when θ = 0 or π. Hence the real number b = 0, so that R(X,Y) = aXY. In the case when θ  =  π we have [formula] for all a,b and [formula]. So a = 0. For θ = 0, i.e., when [formula] for all a,b, |R(X,Y)| = 2|X||Y|. So, a =   ±  2. Since changing X,Y,Z to - X, - Y, - Z leaves the 2nd fundamental form fixed and changes the 3rd fundamental form by a sign, we may choose the positive sign.

Classification of [formula]

We have seen in Lemma [\ref=sub] that the 3rd fundamental form [formula] satisfies

[formula]

We now prove that there are only three possibilities for [formula].

Up to isometry, the possible [formula] are either

[formula]

constructed by Ozeki and Takeuchi, where [formula] coincides with the octonian multiplication, or

[formula]

constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner, where either [formula] or [formula] for all [formula].

The proof of Theorem [\ref=Th] consists of a series of lemmas and corollaries in the following subsections.

The case when θ  ≠  0 and π

Suppose θ  ≠  0 and π. Let X and Y be purely imaginary and perpendicular vectors in [formula] and let W be in the orthogonal complement of the quaternion algebra A generated by X and Y. Then

[formula]

if e is perpendicular to A, while

[formula]

if XY is parallel to e; here, the sign agrees with that of R(X,Y).

We may assume X,Y are unit vectors. Suppose X,Y and XY are all perpendicular to e. Complete it to an octonian basis e0,X,Y,XY,e,Xe,Ye,(XY)e of [formula]. The third identity in Corollary [\ref=class] and Proposition [\ref=CRUCIAL] imply that

[formula]

Likewise, the fourth identity in Corollary [\ref=class] and Proposition [\ref=CRUCIAL] imply

[formula]

Meanwhile,

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]

by the first two identities of Corollary [\ref=anti]. Lastly, [formula] by the first identity of Corollary [\ref=class]. In conclusion,

[formula]

To determine a and b, setting U = e and V = Y in the 3rd equation in Corollary [\ref=anti], we deduce

[formula]

In the same vein,

[formula]

while its left hand side simplifies to

[formula]

by [\eqref=span]. So, when θ  ≠  π / 2, we end up with

[formula]

which is exactly

[formula]

We then use the third identity of Corollary [\ref=anti] to see that

[formula]

for W = Xe,Ye,(XY)e, and hence for all W perpendicular to A.

When θ  =  π / 2, a straightforward calculation gives

[formula]

so that once more

[formula]

In the case when XY = e, we know R(X,Y) =   ±  (XY - YX) =   ±  2e. We form an octonian basis e0,X,Y,e,W,WX,WY,We. Then

[formula]

where the last identity follows from Corollary [\ref=anti]. It follows that

[formula]

for some [formula]. But then for (polynomial) degree reason a = 0. Since

[formula]

we see by [\eqref=sub'] that

[formula]

Suppose θ  ≠  0 and π. Let X and Y be purely imaginary and perpendicular vectors in [formula] and let W be in the quaternion algebra A generated by X and Y. Then

[formula]

if e is perpendicular to A, while

[formula]

if XY is parallel to e; here, the sign agrees with that of R(X,Y).

The proof follows the same line of thoughts as in the preceding lemma. Thus we shall only indicate the essential point.

We first assume that e is perpendicular to A so that by the preceding lemma

[formula]

for Z perpendicular to A. Then as before we construct an octonian basis e0,X,Y,XY,e,Xe,Ye,(XY)e. We know [formula] and [formula]. By the 5th identity of Corollary [\ref=class],

[formula]

For Z perpendicular to A, we use [\eqref=following] to see

[formula]

so that we derive

[formula]

while

[formula]

Therefore, we conclude

[formula]

(Note that [formula] if θ  =  π / 2.) When XY = e, we from the octonian basis e0,X,Y,e,W,XW,YW,(XY)W and we have R(X,Y) =   ±  2XY and [formula] for Z perpendicular to A. We see [formula] and [formula] for all Z perpendicular to A. Hence

[formula]

Suppose θ  ≠  0 and π. For all [formula] and all [formula] we have

[formula]

Thus the hypersurfaces are of the type constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner.

Lemma [\ref=sub5] and Corollary [\ref=C] only deal with the case when the imaginary X and Y are perpendicular in [formula], which leaves an undetermined sign. We now remove the sign by considering the case when X = Y.

Let [formula] be orthonormal such that e is perpendicular to X,Y and XY. Then the circles X(t): =  cos (t)X +  sin (t)Y and Y(t): =  -  sin (t)X +  cos (t)Y satisfy that X(t),Y(t),X(t)Y(t) are perpendicular to e. Differentiating [\eqref=Hee] at t = 0, we obtain

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

unless θ  =  π / 2. Homogenizing and comparing polynomial types, we get

[formula]

when θ  ≠  π / 2. On the other hand, when θ  ≠  π / 2, we fix the same X and choose a Y such that XY = e, differentiating [\eqref=Haa] gives

[formula]

Therefore, the sign must be positive when θ  ≠  π / 2.

When θ  =  π / 2, the formula [\eqref=Good] implies [formula] for all [formula], and so [formula] is skew-symmetric in X and Y. So, a priori the sign is undetermined. However, by [\eqref=ind] and [\eqref=Umm] we have seen [formula] for all Z when e is perpendicular to X,Y and XY. The sign is ambiguous only in the case when XY = e. Now, set e = e4. Then since any two different imaginary basis elements ea,eb  ≠  e4 satisfy either eaeb = e4, or ea,eb and eaeb are all perpendicular to e4, the analysis in Lemma [\ref=sub5] and Corollary [\ref=C] provides a recipe for writing down [formula] explicitly as follows.

[formula]

where i,j  ≥  1 run over the indexes where eieje4  =    ±  e0.

Since changing X,Y,Z to - X, - Y, - Z retains the 2nd fundamental form and changes the 3rd fundamental form by a sign, we might as well choose the positive sign.

Therefore, in any event, the 3rd fundamental form is the desired form given by [\eqref=hot].

Proposition [\ref=deform] implies that we can always perturb to find a mirror point x*∈M- at which θ = 0 or π, even when initailly the choice of x* produces an angle θ different from 0 and π. Therefore, the classification is reduced to the case when θ = 0 or π.

The case when θ = 0 or π

By Corollary [\ref=cute], we know R(X,Y) = XY - YX for θ = 0 and [formula] for θ  =  π.

Suppose [formula] For [formula], we have

[formula]

This follows from R(X,Y) = XY - YX and Corollary [\ref=class].

If the normed algebra is [formula], then Theorem [\ref=Th] is true.

By Remark [\ref=Q], either [formula] or = ba for all [formula].

Case 1. [formula]

Then by [\eqref=identity], [formula] by the associativity of [formula]. So,

[formula]

The hypersurface is of the type constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner by Section [\ref=sec5].

Case 2. [formula]

Let X,Y be mutually orthogonal and purely imaginary. We set Z = XY. Then the first, third and fourth identities of Corollary [\ref=class1] imply [formula] is perpendicular to X,Y,Z; therefore, [formula] is parallel to e0. Let [formula] for some constant c. By identity [\eqref=identity] we obtain the identity [formula]; we see therefore c =   ±  1. Thus,

[formula]

Meanwhile,

[formula]

Corollary [\ref=class1] also yields

[formula]

Putting all these together, we arrive at

[formula]

where c = 1 for the first equation and c =  - 1 for the second. Although we have derived the formulae assuming that X and Y are perpendicular, the same formulae remain true for any two imaginary X and Y since [formula] is skew-symmetric in U,V.

If c = 1, then

[formula]

So the hypersurface is of the type constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner by Section [\ref=sec5]. It satisfies [\eqref=goot]

[formula]

We show c =  - 1 is impossible. Assume otherwise. Then since such an isoparametric hypersurface must also satisfy [\eqref=goot], we would conclude

[formula]

by [\eqref=bridging]. This is a contradiction.

To finish Theorem [\ref=Th] in the octonian case, we break it into two cases.

Case 1. [formula]

Identity [\eqref=identity] shows that [formula] so that [formula] is skew-symmetric in [formula]

Let X,Y  ≠  0 be perpendicular and purely imaginary and W be in the orthogonal complement of A, the quaternion algebra generated by X and Y. We know by [\eqref=QQ] and [\eqref=span] that [formula], if X,Y and XY are all perpendicular to e, and the same formula holds if XY = e, where the signs might not be related a priori in the two cases. We assume first that the signs are identical. Namely,

[formula]

where c = 1 or c =  - 1 for all W perpendicular to A. If c = 1, then

[formula]

which remains true for any two purely imaginary X and Y not necessarily perpendicular to each other, as [formula] is skew-symmetric in X,Y. It follows that

[formula]

for any [formula], as it is also true for Z∈A by Corollary [\ref=quaternion], where we use [\eqref=E] and [\eqref=EE] to see that [formula] for Z∈A. This is the isoparametric hypersurface constructed by Ozeki and Takeuchi.

If c =  - 1, then

[formula]

so that there holds

[formula]

for any [formula], as it is true for Z∈A by Corollary [\ref=quaternion]. These are the isoparametric hypersurfaces constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner.

We need to remove the case when [formula] if X,Y, and XY are all perpendicular to e, whereas [formula] when XY = e. Assuming this is the case. Then Corollary [\ref=quaternion] implies

[formula]

where [formula] if XY = e. As seen in Corollary [\ref=quaternion], the existence of an isoparametric hypersurface with such a [formula] would imply

[formula]

But then if we pick XY = e and W = e0 + Xe, we get

[formula]

This is a contradiction.

Case 2. [formula]

Note that again [formula] so that [formula] is skew-symmetric in the first two slots.

If c = 1, then

[formula]

so that

[formula]

for any [formula], as [formula] on A.

If c =  - 1, then [formula] only differs from the previous case by a negative sign. Changing X,Y,Z to - X, - Y, - Z converts it to the previous case.

This completes the classification of Theorem [\ref=Th].

In the octonian case, the two isoparametric hypersurfaces with [formula] constructed by Ferus, Karcher and Münzner are of Condition B at x*∈M-. In contrast, the hypersurface with [formula] is not of Condition B at x*; however, it is of both Condition A and B at x∈M+ constructed by Ozeki and Takeuchi.

In the quaternionic case, however, (XY - YX)Z = X(YZ) - Y(XZ), so that we have only two different such isoparametric hypersurfaces, where the example of Ozeki and Takeuchi of multiplicities (3,4) of Conditions A and B at x∈M+ is also of Condition B at x*∈M-. The other isoparametric hypersurface is of Condition B at x*∈M- with q* = X(ZY) - (XZ)Y = 0; it is the homogeneous example of multiplicities (4,3).
