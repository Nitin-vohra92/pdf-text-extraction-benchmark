Special functions associated to a certain fourth order differential equation

Introduction

Special functions have been a powerful analytic tool in various areas of mathematics. One reason for their usefulness is the fact that there are a number of different aspects under which special functions simultaneously have good properties and admit explicit formulas (e.g. differential equations, orthonormal bases, recurrence relations, integral representations, etc.). Many of the classical special functions of this kind are associated to specific second order differential equations. In contrast, in this article we initiate the study of special functions associated to the following fourth order differential operator

[formula]

with two parameters μ,ν. Here [formula] denotes the one-dimensional Euler operator.

The differential operator Dμ,ν is symmetric with respect to the parameters μ and ν, i.e. Dμ,ν  =  Dν,μ (see Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (1)). Further, if μ,ν  ≥   - 1 are integers of the same parity, then the operator Dμ,ν extends to a self-adjoint operator on [formula] with discrete spectrum (see Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (4)). We then ask

What are the eigenfunctions of Dμ,ν?

The starting point for our search for eigenfunctions of Dμ,ν is the fact that the principal part of Dμ,ν is a product of second order operators in the Weyl algebra. We will construct generating functions for eigenfunctions of Dμ,ν as modifications of products of generating functions for eigenfunctions of second order operators. More precisely, we introduce four generating functions Gμ,νi(t,x) (i = 1,2,3,4). Of particular importance for the L2-theory will be where [formula] and [formula] denote the normalized I- and K-Bessel functions. Gμ,ν2(t,x) is real analytic at t = 0 and we can define a family of real analytic functions Λμ,ν2,j(x) on [formula] ([formula]) as the coefficients of the Taylor expansion In the L2-theory for the operator Dμ,ν we have to assume the following integrality condition

[formula]

Then we obtain the following result (for a proof see Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (4), Corollary [\ref=cor:Nonzeroness] and Theorem [\ref=thm:EigFct]):

Thus [\eqref=IntCond] implies that the functions Λμ,ν2,j(x) ([formula]) are orthogonal to each other. It is also possible to show completeness and to give explicit formulas for the L2-norms. In fact, Corollaries [\ref=cor:completeness] and [\ref=cor:Norms] yield

We now drop the L2-condition and consider general eigenfunctions of Dμ,ν. The other three generating functions Gμ,νi(t,x) (i = 1,3,4) are defined by similar formulas as Gμ,ν2(t,x) (see [\eqref=eq:G1] - [\eqref=eq:G4]), but we have to impose an additional condition for i = 3,4:

[formula]

Then again we can define a families of real analytic functions Λμ,νi,j(x) on [formula] ([formula]) via the Taylor (i = 1,2), respectively Laurent (i = 3,4) expansions of Gμ,νi(t,x). (It is convenient to set [formula] for i = 1,2 and j < 0, and for i = 3,4 and j <  - μ.)

The differential equation Dμ,νu = λu has a regular singularity at x = 0 with characteristic exponents {0, - ν, - μ, - μ  -  ν}. This allows us to prove the following theorem (cf. Theorems [\ref=lem:Asymptotics] and [\ref=thm:EigFct]):

The differential operator Dμ,ν has an irregular singularity at x =   ∞  . In Theorem [\ref=lem:Asymptotics] we also describe the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions Λμ,νi,j(x) as x  →    ∞  . In view of Remark [\ref=rem:asym-infty] this also provides the asymptotics for x  →    -    ∞  .

The functions Λμ,νi,j have various other remarkable properties. First we mention the integral representations in terms of Laguerre polynomials Lαn, which can be used to find the special values of Λμ,νi,j(x) (i = 1,2) at [formula] in terms of Laguerre polynomials (see Theorem [\ref=prop:IntFormulae], Corollary [\ref=cor:SpecialValue], and Remark [\ref=rem:SpecialValue2]).

Another property of the functions Λμ,ν2,j is that they are eigenfunctions of Meijer's G-transform Tμ,ν. Here Tμ,ν is the integral operator given by where denotes Meijer's G-function (see [\cite=Fox61]). It is proved in [\cite=Fox61] that, if μ,ν  ≥   - 1 are not both equal to - 1, Tμ,ν is a unitary operator on [formula] and T2μ,ν  =  . In particular, we have the following orthogonal decomposition into + 1 and - 1 eigenspaces of Tμ,ν: In Section [\ref=sec:GTrafo] we prove:

Finally, the functions Λμ,νi,j are subject to the following three recurrence relations (see Propositions [\ref=prop:RecRelH], [\ref=prop:RecRelxSq], [\ref=prop:Formula1] for more details):

Since the generating functions Gμ,νi(t,x) are given in terms of Bessel functions, Theorems B and E give rise to identities for the I- and K-Bessel functions and Meijer's G-function, some of which we could not trace in the literature (see Corollaries [\ref=cor:BesselCompleteness], [\ref=cor:BesselIntFormula] and [\ref=cor:BesselIntFormula2]).

Most of our proofs are of a purely analytic nature. A special role is played by generating functions. The approach to use the factorization of the principal part of the differential operator to construct generating functions might be useful also for other differential operators of a similar type.

Our proofs for Theorems A, B and E, however, partly rely on representation theory, and for this reason we had to assume the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond]. In fact, our operator Dμ,ν is induced from the Casimir action in the Schrödinger model for the minimal representation of the semisimple Lie group G = O(p,q) where p = μ + 3 and q = ν + 3 when (IC1) is satisfied. This representation is realized on the Hilbert space L2(C), where C is an isotropic cone in [formula] and is parameterized by bipolar coordinates where [formula] denotes the unit sphere in [formula]. Hence μ + 1 and ν + 1 play the role of dimensions of certain spheres if the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond] is satisfied. In this case the functions Λμ,ν2,j are K-finite vectors of the representation and the recurrence relations in Theorem E can be explained by the Lie algebra action. The connection to Meijer's G-transform also arises from representation theory. In fact, the unitary integral transform Tμ,ν is the radial part of the unitary inversion operator FC on L2(C) defined by the special value of the minimal representation at the longest Weyl group element. This operator plays the role of a Fourier transform on C.

The special values of our parameters at [formula] are of particular interest. In this case, the functions Λμ,ν2,j(x) reduce essentially to Laguerre polynomials Lμj(x) (see Corollary [\ref=cor:SpecialValue] and Remark [\ref=rem:SpecialValue2]) and the fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν is of the form where [formula] is basically the standard second order Laguerre operator of having [formula] as eigenfunctions (see Remark [\ref=rem:DiffEqSpecialCase]).

In the case ν =  - 1 the isotropic cone is the light cone in the Minkowski space which splits into the forward and backward cone. Correspondingly, the minimal representation of O(p,2) splits into a highest weight and a lowest weight representation which have been well-studied also in physics. For example, it may be interpreted as the bound states of the hydrogen atom when (μ,ν) = (1, - 1), so that G = O(4,2).

On the other hand, in the case ν = 1, it is noteworthy that Laguerre polynomials again occur as K-finite vectors of the minimal representations of the groups G = O(p,4) with even integers [formula]. In this case, the minimal representation was discovered not so long ago (see [\cite=Kos90] for SO(4,4)), and it is known to admit neither highest nor lowest weight vectors.

Notation: [formula], [formula], [formula].

The fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν

In this section we collect basic properties on the fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν with two parameters [formula] which was introduced in [\eqref=eq:DiffOp1].

Dμ,ν  =  Dν,μ.

Dμ,νu = λu is a differential equation with regular singularity at x = 0. The characteristic exponents are 0, - μ, - ν, - μ  -  ν.

If μ,ν  ≥   - 1, then Dμ,ν is a symmetric unbounded operator on the Hilbert space [formula]. If, in addition, μ  ≥  ν  ≥   - 1 are not both equal to - 1, the strictly increasing sequence [formula] defined in [\eqref=eq:EigValues] belongs to the L2-spectrum of Dμ,ν.

If μ and ν satisfy the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond], then Dμ,ν extends to a self-adjoint operator on [formula]. It has discrete spectrum given precisely by [formula]. Furthermore, every L2-eigenspace is one-dimensional.

In the special cases where [formula] the differential operator Dμ,ν collapses to where

[formula]

It is likely that Dμ,ν is still (essentially) self-adjoint without assuming the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond]. For example, for [formula] and arbitrary μ >  - 1 we will construct L2-eigenfunctions [formula] of [formula] which are basically Laguerre polynomials (see Corollary [\ref=cor:SpecialValue] and Remark [\ref=rem:SpecialValue2]). Hence, they form a basis of the corresponding L2-space and it follows that [formula] is self-adjoint with discrete spectrum. However, our proof for [formula] uses representation theory of the semisimple Lie group O(μ + 3,ν + 3) and hence uses condition [\eqref=IntCond] in a crucial way.

The generating functions Gμ,νi(t,x)

To to determine eigenfunctions of the Dμ,ν we define the following generating functions Gμ,νi(t,x) i = 1,2,3,4

[formula]

Here

[formula]

denote the normalized I- and K-Bessel functions.

Let us state the differential equations for the generating functions which we will make use of later.

The functions Gμ,νi(t,x), i = 1,2,3,4, satisfy the following three differential equations:

The fourth order partial differential equation

The second order partial differential equation

[formula]

The fifth order ordinary differential equation in t

[formula]

where we set

[formula]

We will also need three recurrence relations for the functions Gμ,νi(t,x). To state the formulas in a uniform way we put

[formula]

The functions Gμ,νi(t,x), i = 1,2,3,4, satisfy the following three recurrence relations:

The recurrence relation in μ

The recurrence relation in ν

The recurrence relation in μ and ν

Suppose [formula]. Then we have the following parity formula for the functions [formula] (i = 1,2,3,4): where

[formula]

It is also easy to see that the generating functions satisfy the following algebraic symmetries

[formula]

The eigenfunctions Λμ,νi,j(x)

The function [formula] is meromorphic near t = 0 for a fixed x > 0 if and only if μ is an odd integer. This explains the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond2], which we will henceforth assume. Then the generating functions Gμ,νi are meromorphic near t = 0 and give rise to sequences [formula] of functions on [formula] as coefficients of the Laurent expansions

[formula]

Since [formula] is an entire function and [formula] has a pole of order μ at z = 0 if [formula] is an odd integer we immediately obtain

[formula]

This allows us to calculate the functions Λμ,νi,j as follows:

[formula]

The L2-solutions Λμ,ν2,j(x) (i.e. the i = 2 case) will be of special interest. Here are its first three functions.

[formula]

To formulate the asymptotic behavior of the functions Λμ,νi,j(x) we use the Landau symbols O and o.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Assume further that [formula] if i = 1,2 and j  ≥    -  μ if i = 3,4.

The asymptotic behavior of the functions Λμ,νi,j as [formula] is given by

[formula]

where [formula] is the Pochhammer symbol.

As x  →    ∞   we have

[formula]

with constants [formula].

As an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=lem:Asymptotics] we obtain

If μ  ≥  ν are not both equal to - 1, we have [formula].

From the explicit formulas for the leading terms of the functions Λμ,νi,j at x = 0 we can draw two more important corollaries.

The function Λμ,νi,j is non-zero if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

i = 1 and μ,ν  ≥   - 1.

i = 2 and μ  ≥  ν  ≥   - 1.

i = 3,4, μ is a positive odd integer and ν >  - 1 such that [formula].

Suppose μ is a positive odd integer and ν > 0 such that [formula], then for fixed [formula] the four functions Λμ,νi,j, i = 1,2,3,4, are linearly independent.

Now we can prove the main theorem of this section.

For i = 1,2,3,4, [formula], the function Λμ,νi,j is an eigenfunction of the fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν for the eigenvalue λμ,νj (see equation [\eqref=eq:EigValues]). If, in addition, μ is a positive odd integer and ν > 0 such that [formula], then for fixed [formula] the four functions Λμ,νi,j, i = 1,2,3,4, form a fundamental system of the fourth order differential equation

Since Dμ,ν  =  Dν,μ by Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (1) and Theorem [\ref=thm:EigFct] implies that for [formula] also [formula] is an eigenfunction of Dμ,ν for the eigenvalue λμ,νj.

If μ and ν satisfy the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond], the system [formula] forms an orthogonal basis of [formula].

Corollary [\ref=cor:completeness] provides a completeness statement for Bessel functions we could not trace in the literature:

Fix an odd integer [formula]. Then for any integer [formula] the sequence [formula] (resp. [formula]) is a basis for [formula]. The Gram-Schmidt process applied to this sequence yields the orthogonal basis [formula] (up to scalar factors).

We end this section with a parity formula for the functions Λμ,νi,j(x) which can be used to determine also the asymptotic behavior of as x  →    -    ∞  . The parity formula itself is an immediate consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem:GenFctParity]:

Suppose [formula]. Then we have the following parity formula for the functions [formula] (i = 1,2,3,4, [formula]): with non-zero coefficients aα,bα as in Lemma [\ref=lem:GenFctParity].

If ν is an odd integer, the functions Λμ,νi,j(x) extend holomorphically to [formula], not only to its universal covering. In this case, Proposition [\ref=prop:ParityLambda] expresses Λμ,νi,j( - x) as linear combination of the functions Λμ,νk,j(x) (k = 1,2,3,4). The coefficients only contain aα and bα with α = 2n + 1 an odd integer (we assumed [\eqref=IntCond2]) and simplify significantly:

[formula]

Integral representations

In this section we show that for i = 1,2 the functions Λμ,νi,j(x) have integral representations in terms of Laguerre polynomials. Recall that for [formula] and [formula] the Laguerre polynomial Lαn(x) is defined by (cf. [\cite=AAR99])

[formula]

For [formula], μ,ν >  - 1 we have the following double integral representations

[formula]

with constants cμ,ν1,j and cμ,ν2,j given by

[formula]

For ν =  - 1 and μ >  - 1 we have

[formula]

with constants cμ, - 11,j and cμ, - 12,j given by

[formula]

The integral representations in Theorem [\ref=prop:IntFormulae] (2) for the special case ν =  - 1 can also be obtained from the integral representations in part (1) for ν >  - 1 by taking the limit ν  →   - 1. For example, to obtain the integral representation for Λμ, - 12,j we have to verify the limit formula

[formula]

for 0  ≤  k  ≤  j. For k = 0 the identity [\eqref=eq:IntFormulaKBessel] turns the left hand side into The map [formula] is continuous so [\eqref=eq:IntLimit] follows from [\eqref=eq:SpecialCaseBesselFcts]. For k > 0 and [formula] we have

[formula]

with some polynomial p. Then one has to show that for [formula]. But this is easily seen using the integral representation [\eqref=eq:IntFormulaKBessel] and the continuity of the map [formula].

As an easy application of the integral representations we give explicit expressions for the functions Λμ,νi,j, i = 1,2, in the case where ν =  - 1.

For ν =  - 1 and [formula] arbitrary we have the following identity of meromorphic functions

[formula]

The symmetry property K-  α = Kα for the K-Bessel functions implies that [formula] and hence Corollary [\ref=cor:SpecialValue] also allows us to compute Λμ,12,j explicitly:

[formula]

In [\cite=HKMM09b] we show that the functions Λμ,ν2,j always degenerate to polynomials if ν is an odd integer. For [formula] these special polynomials do not appear in the standard literature. Properties for these polynomials such as differential equations, orthogonality relations, completeness, recurrence relations and integral representations will be studied thoroughly in [\cite=HKMM09b].

Corollary [\ref=cor:SpecialValue] and Remark [\ref=rem:SpecialValue2] suggest a relation between the fourth order differential equation Dμ,νu = λμ,νju in the cases where [formula] and the second order differential equation (see [\cite=AAR99])

[formula]

for the Laguerre polynomials Lαn(x). In fact, by Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (5) the fourth order differential operator [formula] collapses to the simpler form

[formula]

with second order differential operators [formula] and constants [formula] defined in Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (5).

For μ >  - 1 the operator Sμ, - 1 itself is self-adjoint on [formula]. It has discrete spectrum given by [formula] and an easy calculation involving [\eqref=eq:LagDiffEq] shows that Λμ, - 12,j is an eigenfunction of Sμ, - 1 for the eigenvalue - (2j + μ + 1). Applying Sμ, - 1 twice yields the fourth order differential equation of Theorem [\ref=thm:EigFct] for Λμ, - 12,j.

The same considerations apply for Sμ, + 1 and Λμ, + 12,j(x) since we have the relations [\eqref=eq:RelLambdapm1] and

[formula]

Similarly to the calculations in [\cite=HKMM09b], where we derive explicit formulas for the functions Λμ,ν2,j if ν is an odd integer, one can find the following expression for Λμ,ν3,j:

[formula]

where 2F2(a1,a2;b1,b2;z) is the hypergeometric function. Using this one can sharpen the estimates for Λμ,ν3,j(x) given in Theorem [\ref=lem:Asymptotics].

Recurrence relations

In this section we will give three types of recurrence relations for the functions Λμ,νi,j. Our first recurrence relation involves the first order differential operator Hα ([formula]) on [formula], given by If [formula], then Hα is a skewsymmetric operator on [formula] since θ* =  - θ - (α + 2) on [formula]. This will allow us to compute the L2-norms for Λμ,ν2,j explicitly if μ and ν satisfy [\eqref=IntCond].

For [formula], i = 1,2,3,4 we have the following recurrence relation in [formula]

[formula]

If μ and ν satisfy [\eqref=IntCond], then

[formula]

An easy calculation involving the recurrence relation [\eqref=eq:RecRelH] shows that the explicit expression [\eqref=eq:Norms] for the norms of the functions Λμ,ν2,j is equivalent to orthogonality of the sequence [formula] in [formula]. It seems likely that this remains true for arbitrary μ  ≥  ν  ≥   - 1 (if not both are equal to - 1) without the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond], but we do not have a proof.

Formula [\eqref=eq:Norms] implies an integral formula for the I- and K-Bessel functions which we did not find in the literature:

Let [formula] and μ,ν satisfy condition [\eqref=IntCond]. Then

[formula]

The second type of recurrence relations expresses x2Λμ,νi,j as linear combination in Λμ,νi,k for [formula]. These recurrence relations are an immediate consequence of the fifth order differential equation for the generating function Gμ,νi given in Lemma [\ref=lem:GenFctPDEs] (3).

For [formula] we have

[formula]

with a,b,c,d,e as in Lemma [\ref=lem:GenFctPDEs] (3).

For [formula] the recurrence relation of Proposition [\ref=prop:RecRelxSq] can be rewritten as with constants aμ,νi,j(k).

The last set of recurrence relations in the parameters μ and ν are again immediate with the corresponding differential equations for the generating functions which have already been stated in Lemma [\ref=lem:GenFctRecRels]:

Let [formula]. With δ(i), ε(i) as in [\eqref=eq:DelEps] we have

The recurrence relation in μ

The recurrence relation in ν

The recurrence relation in μ and ν

Meijer's G-transform

The main result of this section is that the functions Λμ,ν2,j are eigenfunctions of a special type of Meijer's G-transform Tμ,ν if μ and ν satisfy [\eqref=IntCond]. Our proof of this result is based on representation theory and will be given in Section [\ref=sec:RepTh]. We do not know whether the statement also holds for general μ  ≥  ν  ≥   - 1.

For [formula] the integral transform Tμ,ν it is defined by Here denotes Meijer's G-function, which was first systematically investigated by Fox in [\cite=Fox61]. Gμ,ν satisfies the fourth order differential equation (see [\cite=EMOT81])

[formula]

For ν =  - 1 the G-function reduces to a J-Bessel function and the operator Tμ, - 1 becomes a Hankel transform.

The following statement can also be obtained from representation theory in the case that μ and ν satisfy [\eqref=IntCond] (see Section [\ref=sec:RepTh] for a proof).

Suppose μ,ν  ≥   - 1 are not both equal to - 1.

Tμ,ν extends to a unitary involutive operator on [formula].

The G-transform Tμ,ν commutes with the fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν.

Suppose that μ and ν satisfy [\eqref=IntCond]. Then for each [formula] the function Λμ,ν2,j is an eigenfunction of Meijer's G-transform Tμ,ν with eigenvalue ( - 1)j.

In Remark [\ref=rem:DiffEqSpecialCase] we noted that for ν =  - 1 the functions Λμ, - 12,j are eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint second order differential operator Sμ, - 1 on [formula]. In [\cite=KM07a] Kobayashi and Mano proved that, if μ is an integer, the operator [formula], defined via spectral theory, is given as

One can use Theorem [\ref=thm:EigFctGTrafo] to obtain an integral formula for the generating function Gμ,ν2 and hence for the Bessel functions involved similar to the one in Corollary [\ref=cor:BesselIntFormula]:

Let [formula], [formula] and assume that μ and ν satisfy condition [\eqref=IntCond]. Then for x > 0

[formula]

Applications of minimal representations

In this section we complete the proofs of Proposition [\ref=prop:DiffOpProperties] (4) and Theorem [\ref=thm:EigFctGTrafo] using representation theory.

There is a long history of research on the interactions of the theory of special functions and representation theory, in particular, related to the analysis on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups. Our fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν is also motivated by group representations. The general features in our setting, however, are quite different from the traditional analysis on homogeneous spaces.

In fact, we are dealing with an extremely small infinite dimensional representation, sometimes referred to as the minimal representation, for which the whole group cannot act on the geometry of the L2-model (the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of the minimal representation is too small for that). Hence Lie algebra action here is not just given by vector fields, but involves higher order differential operators. (In our particular example second order suffices.) We shall prove in Theorem [\ref=lem:CasimirAction] that the fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν comes from the Casimir operator when both μ and ν are integers ≥   - 1. We shall also discuss the underlying algebraic structure of various formulas on (Λμ,ν2,j)j such as recurrence relations (Theorem E) and Meijer's G-transforms (Theorem D) in connection with representation theory.

In the converse direction, the theory of special functions developed in this paper allows us to interpret the functions Λμ,ν2,j as a basis for the space [formula] of K'-spherical vectors (see [\eqref=eq:IsoL2rad]) and hence contributes to representation theory.

We adopt the notation of [\cite=KM07b]. In particular, we assume that [formula] are integers of the same parity and [formula]. With μ = p - 3, ν = q - 3 this is equivalent to μ  ≥  ν  ≥   - 1 being integers with the same parity not both equal to - 1, i.e. to the integrality condition [\eqref=IntCond].

Consider the indefinite orthogonal group of signature (p,q), where Then G is a semisimple non-compact Lie group. In [\cite=KO03] Kobayashi and Ø rsted construct an L2-model of the minimal representation π of G, which is an analogon of the classical Schrödinger model of the Shale-Segal-Weil representation of the metaplectic group. More precisely, it is an irreducible unitary representation on the Hilbert space [formula], where is an isotropic cone in [formula] and [formula] an O(p - 1,q - 1)-invariant measure on C. Let w0: = Ip,q. The unitary operator FC: = π(w0) plays a role of the Fourier transform on the isotropic cone C. We call FC the unitary inversion operator.

On the isotropic cone C, we set Then the pull-back of the projection [formula] induces an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the closed subspace of L2(C) consisting of radial functions, or equivalently, functions that are invariant by K': = O(p - 1)  ×  O(q - 1). Elements of [formula] are called K'-spherical vectors. To justify this name consider the bipolar coordinates which parameterize the cone C: where [formula] denotes the unit sphere in [formula]. Then the action of K' = O(p - 1)  ×  O(q - 1) is given by rotation in the spherical variables ω and η. Hence, K'-spherical functions are those depending only on the radial part r.

We take a negative definite bilinear form B on [formula] which is invariant under the adjoint action and turns (Ei,j - Ej,i)1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n into an orthonormal basis with respect to - B. Restriction to the Lie algebra [formula] of the maximal compact subgroup K: = O(p)  ×  O(q) of G yields the Casimir element The fourth order differential operator Dμ,ν with integral μ and ν arises from the Casimir action on the minimal representation as follows.

Suppose [formula]. Under the coordinate change x: = 2r the operator [formula] acts on [formula] as the differential operator Dp - 3,q - 3.

The reason why the Casimir operator [formula] is a differential operator of fourth order rather than of second order is the fact that the group K = O(p)  ×  O(q) cannot act continuously in a non-trivial fashion on the cone C, whereas the smaller group K'  ⊆  K does.

If one restricts the representation to the maximal compact subgroup K = O(p)  ×  O(q)  ⊆  G one has the following multiplicity-free decomposition of π into K-irreducible representations

[formula]

with Here [formula] is the space of spherical harmonics on [formula] of degree j, on which the orthogonal group O(n) acts irreducibly. The branching laws for [formula] ([formula]) show that the O(n - 1)-fixed vectors in [formula] form a one-dimensional subspace. Hence, if one restricts to the smaller subgroup K' = O(p - 1)  ×  O(q - 1)  ⊆  K, then the K'-spherical vectors in each K-type Va form a one-dimensional subspace [formula]. Considering only the radial functions in [\eqref=eq:KtypeDecomp] we obtain

[formula]

because the property of being radial is determined by the subgroup K' of K. We will show that each subspace [formula] is spanned by Λp - 3,q - 32,a(2r).

In order to do so we observe that by Schur's Lemma the Casimir element Ω acts as a scalar on each K-type Va, because Ω is central in the universal enveloping algebra [formula]. In fact, representation theory of the compact group K = O(p)  ×  O(q) shows that Ω acts on Va by

[formula]

Now we are ready to prove that the differential operator Dμ,ν is self-adjoint.

By [\cite=War72] the Casimir element Ω defines a self-adjoint operator on the representation space L2(C). On the other hand, the element - 2Ω acts on [formula] as Dμ,ν by Theorem [\ref=lem:CasimirAction]. Hence Dμ,ν extends to a self-adjoint operator on the space [formula] of radial functions. The decomposition [\eqref=eq:KtypeDecompRad] is discrete, so the spectrum of Dμ,ν is discrete and given by twice the eigenvalues [\eqref=eq:CasimirEigVal] of the Casimir element which in view of j = a,μ = p - 3, and ν = q - 3 are given by Since the spaces [formula] in [\eqref=eq:KtypeDecompRad] are one-dimensional and the [formula] is strictly increasing, the L2-eigenspaces of Dμ,ν are also one-dimensional.

For the L2-model of the minimal representation, it is in general a difficult problem to find explicit K-finite vectors (see [\cite=KM07a]). Theorem [\ref=lem:CasimirAction] implies that the functions Λμ,ν2,j ([formula]) for integers μ  ≥  ν of the same parity are indeed K-finite vectors of the minimal representation π. More precisely, we have:

For every [formula], the space [formula] is one-dimensional. It is spanned by Λp - 3,q - 32,j(2r).

For q = 2 (p and j arbitrary), we saw in Corollary [\ref=cor:SpecialValue] that In this special case Corollary [\ref=cor:Kfin] was already proved in [\cite=KM07a].

For j = 0 (p and q arbitrary) Example [\ref=ex:3Fcts] gives This bottom case of Corollary [\ref=cor:Kfin] was already found in [\cite=KO03] by taking theFourier transform of the conformal model of the minimal representation.

The relation of the G-transform considered in Section [\ref=sec:GTrafo] to representation theory was found by Kobayashi and Mano in [\cite=KM07b].

Under the coordinate change x = 2r the unitary involution operator FC acts on [formula] as the G-transform [formula].

In the case that μ = p - 3 and ν = q - 3 satisfy [\eqref=IntCond] we can now give an alternative proof of the results of Proposition [\ref=prop:GTrafoProperties] using representation theory. By Theorem [\ref=thm:WeilInv] the operator Tp - 3,q - 3 is given as the restriction of the unitary inversion operator FC  =  π(w0) to [formula]. This shows that Tp - 3,q - 3 defines a unitary operator on [formula]. Furthermore, since w0 normalizes (actually, centralizes) the Lie algebra [formula], w0 commutes with the Casimir operator Ω. Therefore, in view of Theorems [\ref=lem:CasimirAction] and [\ref=thm:WeilInv], also Dp - 3,q - 3 and Tp - 3,q - 3 commute.

Theorem [\ref=thm:WeilInv] also allows us to give the announced proof of the fact that the functions Λp - 3,q - 32,j are eigenfunctions of Meijer's G-transform.

It is observed in [\cite=KM07b] that w0 acts on each K-type Va as [formula]. Since Λp - 3,q - 32,a(2r) is a K-finite vector in the K-type Va by Corollary [\ref=cor:Kfin], the statement follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:WeilInv].

Finally, we can also give a representation theoretic explanation for the recurrence relations in Propositions [\ref=prop:RecRelH] and [\ref=prop:RecRelxSq]. Using the notation of [\cite=KM07b] we consider the Langlands decomposition of the maximal parabolic subalgebra [formula] of [formula]: [formula] is the Lie algebra of O(p - 1,q - 1) which acts on the geometry C. The abelian part [formula] is one-dimensional and spanned by [formula] which acts on L2(C) as the first order differential operator where E is again the Euler operator. Hence H acts on radial functions as the differential operator -  Hp + q - 6 (see Section [\ref=sec:RecRel]). Finally [formula] is spanned by [formula] whose action is given by the multiplication operators In particular, the sum of squares [formula] leaves the space of radial functions [formula] invariant.

The key to an understanding of the underlying algebraic structure of the recurrence relations in Propositions [\ref=prop:RecRelH] and [\ref=prop:RecRelxSq] is the action of H and [formula] on the K-types Va. For convenience put V- 1: = 0.

The Lie algebra action [formula] ([formula]) induces the following linear maps for each [formula]:

[formula]

Note that both [formula] and [formula] leave [formula] invariant. Since [formula] is one-dimensional and spanned by Λp - 3,q - 32,a(2r) for every [formula], we obtain

[formula]

which can be viewed as qualitative versions of Propositions [\ref=prop:RecRelH] and [\ref=prop:RecRelxSq].
