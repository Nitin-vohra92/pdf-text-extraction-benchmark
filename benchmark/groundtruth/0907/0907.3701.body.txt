Presentations of matrix rings

Recently, there has been a significant interest in the combinatorial properties the ring of n  ×  n matrices. The aim of this note is to describe a short (may be the shortest possible) presentation of the matrix ring [formula]. This presentation is significantly shorter than the previously known ones, see [\cite=SP]. We hope that this presentation will have applications in computational ring theory and might also be used to build crypto-systems based on combinatorial problems in rings.

Surprisingly, the number of relations in the presentation does not depend on the size of the matrices and all relations have relatively simple form. In contrast, the similar statement for the groups [formula] is significantly more difficult to prove and the presentations have more relations, see [\cite=GKKL1] [\cite=GKKL3].

The ring of n  ×  n matrices over [formula], for n  ≥  2, has a presentation with 2 generators and 3 relations

[formula]

Let R denote the ring defined by the above presentation. A homomorphism from the free associative ring to [formula] given by

[formula]

factors through the ring R. The first two relations are satisfied because both X and Y are nilpotent matrices and the third follows form a direct computation. shows that they satisfy the relation

[formula]

Moreover, this homomorphism is surjective because the matrices X and Y generate [formula] as a ring.

Thus, it remains to prove that the ring R is not too big. Our first step is to find other relations, which are satisfied in the ring R.

For any non-negative integers k,l,m  ≥  0, such that m  ≥  l, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

The proof uses induction on l. The base case l = 0 is trivial. If k = 0 again there is noting to prove. Thus, without loss of generality we can assume that k,l  ≥  1.

[formula]

[formula]

By the induction assumption the part of the second term in the brackets is equal to xn + m - l = 0, since m  ≥  l. Thus, the second term vanishes. Another application of the induction assumption shows that

[formula]

and completes the proof of the first part of the lemma.

The proof of the second part uses similar induction. Alternatively, one can use that the transformation x  →  y and y  →  x extends to an anti-automorphism σ of R and apply σ to the identities from the first part.

The ring R is generated, as an additive group, by the elements yixj for 0  ≤  i,j < n.

Let T denote the additive subgroup of R generated by the elements yixj. It suffices to show that T is closed under, both left and right, multiplication by x and y, because 1 = x0y0∈T. The two relations xn = yn = 0 imply that T is closed under left multiplication by y and right multiplication by x. Thus, it remains to show that xT,Ty  ⊆  T. The element x.yixj is clearly in T if i = 0. If i  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

[formula]

where the last equality uses Lemma [\ref=lem1].

Similarly, yixj.y is in T if j = 0 and if j  ≥  1 we have

[formula]

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lem2] together with the surjection for R to [formula] is sufficient to show to R is isomorphic to the matrix ring, but one can build the isomorphism directly:

We have that

[formula]

Here, we assume that ai,j  =  0 if either i or j is outside the interval

[formula]

Two of the identities follow directly from the definition of the elements ai,j. The only non-trivial ones are ai,jy  =  ai,j - 1 and xai,j  =  ai - 1,j. By the definition of the element ai,j we have

[formula]

If j = 0 the right side is equal to yi + 1  -  yi + 1xy  =  yi + 1yn - 1xn - 1  =  0. Otherwise, we can use the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem2]:

[formula]

[formula]

The proof of the second relation xai,j  =  ai - 1,j is similar.

The product ai,jap,q is equal to 0 if [formula] and is equal to ai,q if j = p. Moreover we have

[formula]

These equalities follows directly from Lemma [\ref=lem3] and the definition of the elements aij.

Thus, the map ai,j  →  ei,j extends to an isomorphism between the ring R and [formula], which completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1].

From the isomorphism between R and [formula] it follows that the elements x and y also satisfy the relation

[formula]

i.e., the map x  →  y and y  →  x can be extended to an automorphism of R.

The following variation of Theorem [\ref=th1] gives presentation of the ring of matrices over [formula]:

For any integer N the matrix ring [formula] has presentation

[formula]

The argument is a slight modification of the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1]. The map x  →  X and y  →  Y is a homomorphism onto [formula]. The proof of injectivity follows the same outline -- Lemmas [\ref=lem1], [\ref=lem2], [\ref=lem3] and [\ref=lem4] still hold. Finally one observes that an - 1,n - 1  =  yn - 1xn - 1 and [formula]. Thus the last relation in the presentation is equivalent to

[formula]

[formula]

therefore Nan - 1,n - 1 = 0, which implies that Nai,j = 0 for all i,j, i.e., the additive group of R has exponent N.

In the case N = p is a prime number, one can use that the matrix algebra [formula] is a cyclic algebra, thus it is possible to obtain a presentation (as an algebra over [formula]) with 2 generators and 3 relations. This leads to a presentation of the ring [formula] with 2 generators and 4 relations. The presentation obtained using this approach uses a presentation of the finite field [formula], which involves an irreducible polynomial of degree n over [formula]. Thus, the relations in this presentation will be more "complicated" than the ones Theorem [\ref=th2]. In some cases, one can modify the presentation of the cyclic algebra and save one relation:

[formula]

In some sense the presentation in Theorem [\ref=th1] is a variant of the presentation of cyclic algebra, where one uses the nilpotent ring [formula] instead of the maximal subfield, however it is not completely clear what is the analog of the "field" automorphism in this picture.

One would like to say that the presentations in Theorems [\ref=th1] and [\ref=th2] are the simplest possible. Unfortunately, we were not able to prove that presentations of the matrix rings with 2 generators and only 2 relations do not exist. The following result shows that there isn't any presentation of the matrix ring [formula] with a single relation:

The number of relations in any presentation of the matrix ring [formula] is at least equal to the number of generators.

The main idea of the proof is to "translate" the notion of the "relation module" from groups rings and use it to obtain a lower bound for the number of relations in a presentation of ring, see [\cite=I].

Let [formula] be a presentation of the ring R. The quotient I / I2 is called relation module associated to this presentation and is naturally a R bi-module. It is clear that the projection of any generating set of the ideal I to I / I2 is a generating set of this bi-module. Thus, the minimal number of generators of relation module gives a lower bound for the number of generators of the ideal I and the number of relations in a presentation of the ring R.

One way to construct a big quotient of the relation module is the following: Let d be the size of the generating set S̄ and let M be the free R bi-module on d generators mi, i.e., [formula]. We can define a ring structure on the abelian group [formula], where the multiplication between elements of R and M is defined using left and right actions of R on M and the product of any two elements in M is equal to zero.

For any generating set S̄ of R with d elements one can define a subring [formula] of [formula] generated by "extensions" of the generators in S̄ by generators of the module M, i.e., s̃i  =  s̄i + mi. It is easy to see that the relation module corresponding to this presentation maps surjectively onto the intersection of [formula] with M.

In the special case of the matrix ring [formula], we have the module isomorphism [formula], where L is free abelian group on n2d generators (this follows form the isomorphism of the bi-modules [formula]). A long computation shows that the intersection of [formula] with M is isomorphic to [formula], where   ⊂  L is a subgroup of rank at least n2(d - 1)  +  n  >  n2(d - 1) -- this bound does not depend on the images of the generators S in [formula]. This completes the proof of the Theorem, since the relation module can not be generated by than d - 1 elements.

A more carefully computation shows that the relation module, corresponding to the map [formula] given by x  →  X and y  →  Y, can be generated by only two elements as an bi-module (for example the elements xy + yn - 1xn - 1 - 1 and xyn  +  yxn generate the relation module). This suggests that it might be possible to "combine" the two relations xn = yn = 0 into a single one and obtain a presentation of [formula] with 2 generators and only 2 relations. Unfortunately, the usual trick of combining such relations -- replacing them with xn = yn does not work, because the presentation

[formula]

defines a ring which surjects onto [formula].

One can view the proof of Theprem [\ref=th3] as an analog of Gaschütz' result [\cite=G] [\cite=Gru], which says that the tensor product of the relation module for a finite group G with [formula] is isomorphic as G-module to [formula], therefore the relation module can not be generated by less than d elements.
