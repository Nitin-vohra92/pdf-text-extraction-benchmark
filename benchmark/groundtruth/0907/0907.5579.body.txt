Introduction

Let (A,a0) be a pointed path-metric space. Let [formula] and B(n) (respectively [formula]) be the open (resp. closed) ball of radius n about a0. We say A is n-almost convex if there are pairs of points (ai,bi)∈A2 such that d(ai,bi)  ≤  n but [formula], where by [formula] we mean the path metric induced from paths restricted to [formula]. The depth of a point a∈A is the distance from a to the complement of [formula]. We say (A,a0) has deep pockets if it has points of arbitrarily large depth. (This concept is clearly of interest primarily for unbounded metric spaces.) Neither of these concepts is a quasi-isometry invariant, but both are coarse invariants.

If G is a group and S a generating set for G, the word metric (denoted by [formula]) gives G the structure of a pointed metric space. It is, admittedly, not a path-metric space, being discrete, but its Cayley graph is. In practice, we ignore the edges of the Cayley graph and simply pretend that sequences of group elements at distance 1 apart are paths. When this is done, it was shown by Cannon in [\cite=C] that the concept of n-almost convexity does not depend on n, provided it is ≥  2. Therefore, we may simply refer to a group's being almost convex with respect to some generating set.

Many groups are already known either not to be almost convex or to have deep pockets. Thus, lamplighter groups are not almost convex with respect to any generating set and have deep pockets with respect to their standard generating set (see [\cite=CT]). A similar but more complicated and delicate argument (in [\cite=W2]) shows the same thing for [formula], where K is a finite-rank abelian group and t acts on K by a hyperbolic automorphism which is an endomorphism of some lattice. Examples include lattices in Sol and the soluble Baumslag-Solitar groups. (Non-almost convexity was already shown for these examples in [\cite=CFGT] and [\cite=MS] respectively; deep pockets were also shown for lattices in Sol in [\cite=W1].)

In this paper, we give a simpler and more general context in which to view these results. In particular, we will be able to prove that [formula] is not almost convex with respect to any generating set and has deep pockets with respect to some generating set.

Not almost convexity

For K any [formula]-module, we denote elements of

[formula]

by ordered pairs (m,k) with [formula] and k∈K. Multiplication is given by (m1,k1)(m2,k2) = (m1 + m2,tm2k1 + k2), where by tm2 we mean [formula] and by m2,i we mean the ith component of m2.

Let K be a [formula]-module and (I1,I2) be a pair of valuations for K with C, b1, , bl as in the definition of a pair of valuations. Let A be a finite subset of K and let [formula]. For [formula], let [formula]. Then there is [formula] with the following property. For 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, let [formula] be such that ai > 0 and

[formula]

Let [formula] for ki∈A. Then there is [formula] such that more than 2p of the B(ai) are ≥   max (I1(k) - D - p,1).

Similarly, if we instead assume all ai < 0, there is [formula] such that more than 2p of the - B(ai) are ≥   max (I2(k) - D - p,1).

We prove the first paragraph; the proof of the second paragraph is analogous.

We choose v1, v2, ∈K inductively as follows. Let V1 be a subset of [formula] formed by choosing 2C integers i with B(ai) greatest (where C is as in the definition of a pair of valuations) and let [formula]. Then let V2 similarly contain the 2C integers with B(ai) next greatest and [formula], and so on. This process must terminate since n is finite; suppose Vq is the last nonempty subset. (It is possible that [formula].) Then [formula].

Let [formula] be such that, for all [formula], at most 2p of the ai are

[formula]

where

[formula]

Then every vi, by construction, is the sum of 2C terms k' with

[formula]

so I1(vi) < M - Ci.

Under these conditions, I claim that, for all [formula], [formula]. The proof is by induction on q - i. For i = q this is weaker than what we already know. For i < q it follows easily from writing

[formula]

where the strict inequality is by induction. The claim is proven.

It follows, setting i = 1, that I1(k) < M. This proves the lemma, letting D = I + C +  log 2C + 2.

Let K be a [formula]-module and (I1,I2) be a pair of valuations for K with b1, , bl as in the definition of a pair of valuations. For [formula], let [formula]. Let [formula]. Let S be any finite generating set for G. Let [formula]. Then there is [formula] such that, for every g = (0,k)∈K  ⊂  G, either I1(g) or [formula]. (These make sense since g∈K.)

Let K be a [formula]-module and (I1,I2) be a pair of valuations for K with b1, , bl as in the definition of a pair of valuations. For [formula], let [formula]. Let [formula]. Let S be any finite generating set for G. Let [formula]. Then there is [formula] such that, for every g = (a,k)∈G with [formula], either I1(k) or [formula].

Note that the result is easy if the coefficient of [formula] is changed from z / 4 to z / 2 or, for that matter, to Az for any A > 1 / 4. For the sequel, however, we will need z / 4.

Let [formula], (m1,k1), , [formula]. We will show either I1(g) or I2(g)  ≤  nz / 4 + F'. Let [formula], so that [formula]; note that all [formula] and a0 = an = 0 (since [formula]). Either at most n / 2 of the B(ai) are positive or at most n / 2 are negative. Assume without loss of generality that at most n / 2 are positive. But

[formula]

It follows that, for each [formula], at most n / 2 - 2j of the B(ai) are > jz. Let [formula], where j is as in the preceding sentence. Then, for each [formula], at most 2p of the B(ai) are >   max (nz / 4 + z - pz,0).

Decompose k = v+ + v-, where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Let

[formula]

Then I1(v-)  ≤  I + C( log 2n + 1), where C is as in the definition of a pair of valuations.

By Lemma [\ref=triangle], there are [formula] and [formula], with D independent of g and n, such that more than 2p of the B(ai) are ≥   max (I1(v+) - D - p,1)  ≥   max (I1(v+) - D - pz,1). It will follow, by the first paragraph, that

[formula]

that is that I1(v+) < nz / 4 + D + z.

But, by the definition of a pair of valuations,

[formula]

where C is again as in the definition of a pair of valuations and F' is a constant depending only, via z, I, D and C, on K and S (not on n or g), so we are done.

Let K be a [formula]-module which has a pair of valuations. Let [formula] and let S be a finite generating set for G. Then G is not almost convex with respect to S.

Let (I1,I2) be the pair of valuations with b1, , bl as in the definition of a pair of valuations. For [formula], let

[formula]

For g = (m,k)∈G, let β(g) = k, I1(g) = I1(k) and I2(g) = I2(k).

Let [formula] and let [formula] be chosen such that B(z')  ≥  B(m') for all [formula]. Let z = B(z'). Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then, for all g∈G,

[formula]

and

[formula]

where C is as in the definition of a pair of valuations. For [formula] and [formula], let gn(i) = sn + ias- 2nasn = si - nas2nas- n. Then, for [formula], [formula].

For [formula], define h+n = gn(J) and h-n = gn( - J), where [formula] is a constant to be chosen later. Let n  ≥  J. By the formula at the end of the preceding paragraph,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Since h+n(h-n)- 1 = s2J, we have

[formula]

Note that this depends only on our choice of J. Also,

[formula]

for n large enough. But similarly

[formula]

so [formula] for n large enough. Similarly, [formula]. Also, the same results hold by analogous arguments when h+n is replaced by h-n.

Every edge of the (left) Cayley graph of G with respect to S connects some (m1,k1) and (m2,k2)∈G with [formula]. Thus any path in the (left) Cayley graph of G with respect to S connecting h-n and h+n must contain some g = (m,k)∈G with [formula]. Suppose

[formula]

Then Corollary [\ref=fourth] says that either

[formula]

or the same for I2(g), where F is as in that proposition. Without loss of generality, we assume the former.

We have

[formula]

We want to choose J so that

[formula]

Since [formula], it will suffice to take

[formula]

that is [formula]. Note that this is independent of n. Then we will have [formula], as desired. It will follow that [formula], so

[formula]

that is I1(h+ng- 1)  ≥  nz - B(m) + I1(a) - 3C > nz - z + I1(a) - 3C. But

[formula]

so [formula] goes to infinity as n does, completing the proof.

Let G be either

a lamplighter group,

[formula] or

[formula], where K is a finite-rank abelian group and t acts by a hyperbolic automorphism which is an endomorphism of some lattice.

Then G is not almost convex with respect to any finite generating set.

The first two cases are easy; the third follows from Section 6 of [\cite=W2].

Let K be an indecomposable [formula]-module such that the actions of t and t- 1 each have at least one (complex) eigenvalue of absolute value > 1. Then [formula] is not almost convex with respect to any generating set.

Let K+ and [formula] be the eigenspaces corresponding to the indicated eigenvalues λ+ and λ-. Let φ+ and φ- be the projections to K+ and K- that come from sending all other eigenspaces to 0. Then, for k∈K, we define [formula] and [formula], where [formula] refers to any norm. These are well-defined since K is indecomposable, so that φ+(k) and φ-(k) are 0 only when k = 0. It is then clear (I1,I2) satisfies the conditions,

Deep pockets

For every b and C there is F with the following property. Let K be a [formula]-module and let (I1,I2) and (I1',I2') be two pairs of valuations for K with C as given and the same b = b1. Let A  ⊆  K be a finite good generating set for K with fuzziness (F,F') for some F'. Then [formula] has deep pockets with respect to [formula].

Let [formula]. Let

[formula]

Let a∈A. Let [formula]. Then I1(ki), I2(ki)  ≥  i - C - M, so, by Proposition [\ref=fourthp], [formula], where H is the quantity referred to as F' in the statement of that proposition. (In particular, H is independent of i.) Let l∈G be such that [formula]. Then lk- 1i = tnk' for some [formula] and k'∈K. Furthermore, [formula] and I1(k'), I1'(k'), I2(k') and [formula]. It follows that l = tnk'' with

[formula],

I1(k''), I2(k'')  ≤  i + M + 2C and

I1'(k''), I2'(k'')  ≥  i - M - 2C

so long as [formula].

Then the definition of a good generating set (with F = 2M + 4C) gives ai∈A for all [formula] and [formula], aj∈A for 1  ≤  i  ≤  F' such that

ai = 0 except for min ( - i - M - 2C,0) - F'  ≤  bi  ≤   max (i + M + 2C,0) + F',

[formula] and

min ( - i - M - 2C,0) - F'  ≤  bij  ≤   max (i + M + 2C,0) + F' for all j.

Thus [formula]. We are done by the Fuzz Lemma from [\cite=W1], since the upper bound on ji goes to infinity as i does.

Let G be a lamplighter group or [formula], where K is a finite-rank abelian group and t acts by a hyperbolic automorphism which is an endomorphism of some lattice. Then G has deep pockets with respect to some generating set.

The first case is easy; the second again requires Section 6 of [\cite=W2].

Let [formula], P, [formula] such that

[formula] and [formula] are coprime,

PQL = QPL,

[formula],

[formula] and

all eigenvalues of QP- 1 have absolute value > 1.

Let t act by QP- 1. Then [formula] has deep pockets with respect to some generating set.

In particular, [formula] has deep pockets with respect to some generating set.

Let B be the symmetrized closed unit cube in K with respect to an n-element generating set for QL. (In what follows, we will use [formula] to denote L1 norm with respect to this generating set.) Let [formula]. If [formula] then let I1(k) = I1'(k). Let

[formula]

if [formula] and

[formula]

(We have [formula] by the last condition on P and Q.) Clearly, (I1,I2) and (I1',I2') are pairs of valuations with b = 1 and [formula], where λ is the least absolute value of any eigenvalue of QP- 1.

Let [formula]. I claim that A is a fuzzy good generating set for K. The first three conditions are clearly satisfied. Let k∈K be such that [formula]. Let N = QI1(k) - I2(k)(PQ- 1)I1(k). Then N(k)∈L (it is here that we use that the determinants are coprime) and

[formula]

where F'' = (QP- 1)F depends only on F.

It remains to show there are ai and aj∈A and [formula] such that

ai = 0 except for min ( - I2(k),0) - F'  ≤  i  ≤   max (I1(k),0) + F',

min ( - 2I2(k),0) - F'  ≤  ij  ≤   max (I1(k) - I2(k),0) + F' for all j and

[formula]

But clearly there are ai∈A such that

[formula]

and k' is the difference of two terms ∈F'''QI1(k) - I2(k)B, where [formula] depends only on F (via F''). Thus for any F there is F' such that A is a finite good generating set with fuzziness (F,F'), so we are done.

The last sentence follows trivially.
