On some operator identities and representations of algebras

1. The following operator identity holds

[formula]

The proof is straightforward:

the operator (J + n)n + 1 annihilates the space of all polynomials of degree not higher than n, Pn(x) = Span{xi:0  ≤  i  ≤  n};

in general, an (n + 1) - th order linear differential operator annihilating Pn(x) must have the form B(x)∂n + 1x, where B(x) is an arbitrary function and

since (J + n)n + 1 is a graded operator, deg(J+n) =  + 1, /footnoteso J+n maps xk to a multiple of xk + 1 deg(J + nn + 1) = n + 1, hence B(x) = bx2n + 2 while clearly the constant b = 1.

It is worth noting that taking the degree in (1) different from (n + 1), the l.h.s. in (1) will contain all derivative terms from zero up to (n + 1)-th order.

The identity has a Lie-algebraic interpretation. The operator (J+n) is the positive-root generator of the algebra sl2 of first-order differential operators (the other sl2-generators are J0n  =  x∂x  -  n / 2 ,J-n  =  ∂x). Correspondingly, the space Pn(x) is nothing but the (n + 1)-dimensional irreducible representation of sl2. The identity (1) is a consequence of the fact that (J + n)n + 1 = 0 in this representation.

There exist other algebras of differential or finite-difference operators (in more than one variable), which admit a finite-dimensional representation. This leads to more general and remarkable operator identities. In the present Note, we show that (1) is one representative of infinite family of identities for differential and finite-difference operators.

2. The Lie-algebraic interpretation presented above allows us to generalize (1) for the case of differential operators of several variables, taking appropriate degrees of the highest-positive-root generators of (super) Lie algebras of first-order differential operators, possessing a finite-dimensional invariant sub-space (see e.g.[\cite=t1]). First we consider the case of sl3. There exists a representation of [formula] as differential operators on [formula]. One of the generators is

[formula]

The space Pn(x,y) = Span{xiyj:0  ≤  i + j  ≤  n} is a finite-dimensional representation for sl3, and due to the fact (J12(n))n + 1 = 0 on the space Pn(x,y), hence we have

[formula]

This identity is valid for [formula] (as described above), but also if y is a Grassmann variable, i.e. y2 = 0 . In the last case, J12(n) is a generator of osp(2,2), see [\cite=t1].

More general (using slk instead of sl3), the following operator identity holds

[formula]

where [formula] are the generalized binomial (multinomial) coefficients. If [formula], then Jk - 2k - 1(n) is a generator of the algebra [formula] [\cite=t1], while some of the variables x's are Grassmann ones, the operator Jk - 2k - 1(n) is a generator of a certain super Lie algebra of first-order differential operators. The operator in l.h.s. of (3) annihilates the linear space of polynomials [formula].

3. The above-described family of operator identities can be generalized for the case of finite-difference operators with the Jackson symbol, Dx (see e.g. [\cite=e])

[formula]

instead of the ordinary derivative. Here, q is an arbitrary complex number. The following operator identity holds

[formula]

(cf.(1)), where [formula] is so-called q-number. The operator in the r.h.s. annihilates the space Pn(x). The proof is similar to the proof of the identity (1).

From algebraic point of view the operator +n is the generator of a q-deformed algebra [formula] of first-order finite-difference operators on the line: 0n  =   xD  -  n̂, -n  =   D, where [formula] (see [\cite=ot] and also [\cite=t1]), obeying the commutation relations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

([formula]'s are related with [formula]'s through some multiplicative factors). The algebra (5) has the linear space Pn(x) as a finite-dimensional representation.

An attempt to generalize (2) replacing continuous derivatives by Jackson symbols immediately leads to requirement tp introduce the quantum plane and q-differential calculus [\cite=wz]

The formulae analogous to (2) have the form

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

are q-binomial coefficient and q-factorial, respectively. Like all previous cases, if [formula], the operator 12(n) is one of generators of q-deformed algebra [formula] of finite-difference operators, acting on the quantum plane and having the linear space Pn(x,y) = Span{xiyj:0  ≤  i + j  ≤  n} as a finite-dimensional representation; the l.h.s. of (7) annihilates Pn(x,y). If y is Grassmann variable, 12(n) is a generator of the q-deformed superalgebra osp(2,2)q possessing finite-dimensional representation.

Introducing a quantum hyperplane [\cite=wz], one can generalize the whole family of the operator identities (3) replacing continuous derivatives by finite-difference operators.
