Abstract

In the low energy domain, Chiral Perturbation Theory parametrizes the small chiral symmetry breaking effects, produced by the quark masses mu, md and ms, in terms of order parameters of massless QCD. The latter can then, in principle, be measured in high precision, low energy experiments. We discuss several relevant processes and possible improvements at future high luminosity tau/charm or K factories.

The [formula] chiral symmetry of QCD with three massless flavours is spontaneously broken, producing an octet of massless pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons. The observed masses MP of the light pseudoscalars then result from the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry through the quark masses mu, md, ms. The latter have values that are sufficiently small as compared to the scale ΛH  ~  1 GeV, where typical hadronic bound states appear, so that their effects can be treated as perturbations around the massless limit mu  =  md  =  ms  =  0.

The masses of the pseudoscalars, for instance, have an expansion

[formula]

where the dots stand for higher order terms and non-analytic terms. The constants [formula] and [formula] are not constrained by chiral symmetry, but their actual values convey informations about the ground state of QCD in the chiral limit. As is well known, [formula] is related to the bilinear quark condensate,

[formula]

where [formula] and |0 >  denote the pion decay constant and the vacuum state, respectively, in the chiral limit. The constant [formula] also corresponds to an order parameter of chiral symmetry, namely to a two point function of scalar and pseudo-scalar quark densities at vanishing momentum transfer, with the infrared singularities arising from one and two Goldstone boson intermediate states subtracted,

[formula]

This two point function satisfies a superconvergent dispersion relation, whose saturation with non-Goldstone hadronic states leads to an estimate [formula]. Since colour degrees of freedom are confined, an estimation of the value of [formula] along the same lines is not possible, while a direct computation of [formula] from QCD has not been achieved so far. [formula] could be of the same order as ΛH [\cite=GOR], or as small as [formula] MeV [\cite=FSS2]. Both scales appear as natural, and our present theoretical understanding of QCD is consistent with both possibilities. However, the two alternatives can, in principle, be distinguished experimentally, as we shall discuss later.

For [formula], the first contribution dominates in Eq.(1), i.e. the ratio

[formula]

is of the order of unity, and the subsequent terms in Eq.(1) only give small corrections to this value [\cite=GL1]. For the same reason, the quark mass ratio r  =  2ms  /  (mu  +  md) is close to its leading order value,

[formula]

In the second alternative where [formula], the two terms in Eq. (1) are comparable, unless the quark masses would be much smaller than usually believed [\cite=GL2]: η may differ appreciably from unity for mu, md in the range 10 - 50 MeV, while the quark mass ratio r is no longer fixed by the lowest order mass formula, Eq.(1), and can be considerably smaller than 25. An analysis [\cite=FSS1] of the Dashen-Weinstein sum rule for the deviations from the Goldberger-Treiman relation shows that, unless the pion-nucleon coupling constant were to differ by several standard deviations [\cite=Arn] from the Koch-Pietarinen value [\cite=Koch] gπNN  =  13.40  ±  0.08, the data indeed seem to favour a value of r in the range 10 - 15. If confirmed, such a small value of r would mean that the standard Chiral Perturbation theory converges very slowly.

In order to dispense with any a-priori idea concerning the value of [formula] , a mathematically consistent rearrangement of the Chiral Perturbation Theory effective Lagrangian has been proposed [\cite=FSS2], [\cite=FSS3], in which r (or η) appears as a free parameter. Roughly speaking, it amounts to count a quark mass insertion as one power of external pseudoscalar momenta, whereas in the standard case [\cite=GL1], the quark masses are counted like two powers of momenta. For r very different from 25, one would then obtain a better convergence rate, while for r  ~   25, this improved Chiral Perturbation Theory reduces to the standard one. It becomes then possible to show that the low-energy pseudoscalar meson scattering amplitude is rather sensitive to the value of r. For instance, the leading order π  -  π scattering amplitude reads [\cite=FSS2]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and r2 denotes the quantity appearing in Eq.(5). In the standard case [formula], r  =  r2 at leading order and one recovers Weinberg's theorem [\cite=W]. The extreme case [formula] gives αππ  =  4, while for r  ~  10, one obtains αππ  ~  2. Hence, the value of r can, in principle, be obtained from π  -  π scattering data. The authors of Ref. [\cite=FSS3] have considered the possibility to extract the value of αππ   /   βππ from existing data. The lack of sufficiently precise experimental information concerning, for instance, the I=0 s-wave scattering length, a00 = 0.26  ±  0.05 (see e.g. Ref. [\cite=N] ), allows the ratio αππ   /   βππ to vary within a rather large range ~  1.5  -  4, which could accomodate any value of [formula] in the range between [formula] and 1 GeV. To settle the fundamental question of the value of [formula], more precise data on the π  -  π phase shifts are needed. At the same time, one should explore other experimental situations where informations on r could be obtained.

The above discussion reflects a rather general situation: no accurate (at a precision level of a few percents) experimental informations on chiral symmetry breaking effects are available at present. This is quite understandable, since usually they only represent an almost negligible fraction of the total observed effect. In this respect, future high-luminosity K factories and/or tau/charm factories offer some interesting opportunities to improve the experimental situation.

The next generation of Ke4 experiments at DAΦNE will increase the number of events by a factor of ten within one year of data taking, and thus improve the precision on the π  -  π phase shifts (for a discussion of semi-leptonic K decays, see Ref. [\cite=BEG] ). A determination of a00 within, say, 5% would rule out the scenario [formula] if the present central value of 0.26 would be confirmed.

An interesting possibility to pin down the value of r directly in Kμ4 decays has also been suggested [\cite=FKSS]. It relies on the observation that the axial vector form factor R (in the notations of Ref. [\cite=BEG] ), whose contributions to the amplitude appear with a suppression factor m2e in the case of Ke4 decays, contributes substancially in the case of Kμ4 decays, and exhihits an observable dependence with respect to r at leading order.

The analysis of Dl4 decays (e.g D+  →  K-  π+  e+  νe) at a tau/charm factory could similarly lead to precise determinations of the phase shifts for K - π scattering, which has also been discussed within Chiral Perturbation Theory [\cite=B], [\cite=BKM].

Quite generally, a tau/charm factory would be welcome as a source of light flavours, through the hadronic decays τ  →  nπ ντ, or τ  →  nπ K ντ. The extraction of the chiral symmetry breaking scalar form factor in e.g. τ  →  3π ντ is kinematically possible [\cite=KM], even with non polarized τ's, but whether it can be done in practice with sufficient accuracy remains unclear. It is also interesting to note that a precise normalization of the divergence of the axial vector in this process would allow for a determination of the quark masses themselves, through the evaluation of the QCD spectral sum rules [\cite=DeR].

Finally, the possibility to obtain the value of the combination a00  -  a20 of π  -  π scattering lengths from the measure of the lifetime of π+  -  π- atoms [\cite=Nem] should also be mentioned. A letter of intent [\cite=Cz] for such an experiment at CERN has recently been approved [\cite=Mon].
