In Ref. [\cite=Shebalin] the following k- space Lagrangian for electromagnetic field, interacting with the   current   [formula] and with the charge density ρ, has been obtained:

[formula]

The approach was used, in which [formula], the vector potential, and [formula] are supposed to be independent to each other. The author of cited paper considers ([\ref=eq:LagSheb]) as the Lagrangian with the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking terms (fourth and fifth in the above formula).

Let us mark, the approach using the additional vector variable (it is designated as [formula] in Ref. [\cite=Shebalin]), which is different from field variables and is considered as independent, is not an innovation. This is just the well-known Hamiltonian canonical formalism (see e.g. [\cite=Visconti]-[\cite=Kallen]). In Ref. [\cite=Sokolov] the canonical-conjugated variable to Aμ is defined identically with the quantity [formula] in [\cite=Shebalin], if we don't take into account the inessential coefficient [formula]:

[formula]

This canonical-conjugated quantities is appeared as a result of using the following Lagrangian:

[formula]

But, in the case of the x- space Lagrangian

[formula]

the quantities [formula] and [formula] are not the canonical-conjugated quantities, as opposed to the case of classical mechanics where [formula], the coordinate, and [formula], the velocity, are, in fact, the canonical quantities. It is not clear, what quantzation procedure are implied by the author of Ref [\cite=Shebalin]. In the case of canonical quantization the Lagrangian FμνFμν does not give us π0, which is equal to zero. In the case of Lagrange quantization it is not clear, what commutation rules should be implemented e.g. for
