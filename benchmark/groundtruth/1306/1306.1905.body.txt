Diffuse planar phase boundaries in a two-phase fluid with one incompressible phase

In this note, we consider the Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system of evolutionary partial differential equations that model the spatiotemporal behaviour of a compressible viscous or inviscid fluid. The fluid is assumed to have a constant temperature θ > 0 and to be a locally homogeneous mixture of two components such that its local state is completely described by the mass fraction c of one of the components and the mass, per volume, of the mixture, ρ. This density ρ is the reciprocal value,

[formula]

of the fluid's specific volume τ. The behaviour of the fluid is described by a thermodynamic potential

[formula]

in which W(c,θ) is the mixing energy and δ a positive constant. The pressure p and the transformation rate q derive from the potential as

System (1) was derived by Blesgen [\cite=Ble] and has recently been shown by Kotschote to possess strong solutions [\cite=MK3].

The following two theorems have been proven in [\cite=F3] under certain assumptions on Û and W.

(Maxwell states and no-flux phase boundaries.) With   <  θ* sufficiently close to a critical temperature θ*, the following holds for every θ∈(,θ*]. There are locally uniquely determined fluid states [formula] depending continuously on θ, such that (i)

[formula]

with

[formula]

and (ii) if θ  <  θ*, then

[formula]

and system [\eqref=NSAC] admits a no-flux (m = 0) phase boundary

[formula]

and (equivalently via x  ↦   - x) a no-flux phase boundary

[formula]

For sufficiently small mass flux m  ≠  0,

(i) the (left endstate, profile, right endstate) triple

[formula]

perturbs regularly to a (left endstate, profile, right endstate) triple

[formula]

corresponding to a traveling-wave phase boundary that is densifying if m > 0 and rarefying if m < 0;

(ii) the (left endstate, profile, right endstate, profile) triple

[formula]

perturbs regularly to a (left endstate, profile, right endstate) triple

[formula]

corresponding to a traveling-wave phase boundary that is rarifying if m > 0 and densifying if m < 0.

The present note serves to point out that Theorems 1 and 2 also hold under the following

Modelling Assumptions. (i) Û is of the form

[formula]

where τ1 is a fixed value with

[formula]

and τ and c range as

[formula]

(ii) With certain critical parameter values [formula],

[formula]

undergoes a generic transition from convex for θ  >  θ* to convex-concave-convex ("double-well") for θ  <  θ*, at c = c*.

To justify assumption (i), consider first a general mixture of two non-interpenetrating phases 1 and 2 of varying mass fractions c,1 - c and possibly varying specific volumes τ1 and τ2, for which

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then restrict attention to the case that phase 1 is perfectly incompressible and thus does not store mechanical energy,

[formula]

Supposing further that phase 2 is lighter than phase 1,

[formula]

and that, as a simple prototypical example, its energy has the form

[formula]

leads to the stated form of Û as a function of τ and c.

Noticing that ÛττÛcc  -  Û2cτ = 0 and thus, in the terminology of [\cite=F3],

[formula]

one readily sees that Theorem 1 follows exactly as in [\cite=F3]. We illustrate this by pointing out that by Lemma 1 of [\cite=F3], the proof amounts to studying the level sets of

[formula]

where y corresponds to c',

[formula]

is the Gibbs potential associated with Û and Pπ(c,y) the unique positive root p of

[formula]

(The latter equation is Eq. (9) in [\cite=F3].) The critical pressure is p = p*, the unique solution < 1 of

[formula]

For (θ,π) near (θ*,p*), the level landscape of Γθ,π undergoes a transition from one saddle (for θ  >  θ*) to a saddle-maximum-saddle configuration (for θ  <  θ* and certain π). In the latter case, the two saddles are at the same level and thus connected by two heteroclinic orbits (that together surround the maximum point) if π assumes a unique value π*(θ). As in [\cite=F3], Theorem 2 then follows from the transversality of the saddle-saddle connections with respect to the parameter π.
