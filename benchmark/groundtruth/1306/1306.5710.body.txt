Cyclically presented modules, projective covers and factorizations

Introduction

An R-module MR is said to be cyclically presented if [formula] for some a∈R. In this paper, we study some natural connections between cyclically presented R-modules, their submodules, their projective covers and factorizations of elements in the ring R. That is, we find some results on projective covers of cyclically presented modules and apply them to the study of factorizations of elements in a ring. In this way, we are naturally led to the class of 2-firs. Recall that a ring R is a 2-fir if every right ideal of R generated by at most 2 elements is free of unique rank. This condition is right/left symmetric, and a ring R is a 2-fir if and only if it is a domain and the sum of any two principal right ideals with non-zero intersection is again a principal right ideal [\cite=Cohn_'85]. P. M. Cohn investigated factorization of elements in 2-firs, applying the Artin-Schreier Theorem and the Jordan-Hölder-Theorem to the corresponding cyclically presented modules [\cite=Cohn_'85]. One of the main ideas developed in this paper is to characterize the submodules of a cyclically presented module MR that, under a suitable cyclic presentation πM:RR  →  MR, lift to principal right ideals of R that are generated by a left cancellative element (Lemmas [\ref=square], [\ref=piexact] and [\ref=cuo]). The key role is played by a class of cyclically presented submodules of a cyclically presented module MR, which we call πM-exact submodules of MR. We show (Theorem [\ref=3.8]) that, for every cyclically presented right R-module MR and every cyclic presentation πM:RR  →  MR with non-zero kernel, the set of all cyclically presented πM-exact submodules is closed under finite sums if and only if R is a 2-fir. As we have said above, when sums and intersections of exact submodules are again exact submodules, we can use the Artin-Schreier and the Jordan-Hölder Theorems to study factorizations of elements.

We also study the rings over which every cyclically presented module has a projective cover. We characterize these rings as the rings R that are Von Neumann regular modulo their Jacobson radical J(R) and in which idempotents can be lifted modulo J(R) (Theorem [\ref=VNR]). Finally, in the last Section, we consider the modules MR whose endomorphism rings E are Von Neumann regular modulo the Jacobson radical J(E) and in which idempotents can be lifted modulo J(E). In particular, this applies to the case in which the module MR in question is quasi-projective (Lemma [\ref=lemma:endo] and Proposition [\ref=vhlpp]).

Throughout the paper, R will be an associative ring with identity 1R  ≠  0R and we will denote by U(R) its group of invertible elements. By an R-module, we always mean a unitary right R-module.

Generalities

Let R be a ring. An element a∈R is left cancellative if, for all b,c∈R, ab  =  ac implies b = c. Equivalently, a∈R is left cancellative if it is non-zero and is not a left zero-divisor. A (non-necessarily commutative) ring R is a domain if every non-zero element is left cancellative (equivalently, if every non-zero element is right cancellative). If a∈R, the right R-module homomorphism λa:RR  →  aR,x  ↦  ax, is an isomorphism if and only if a is left cancellative. More precisely, [formula] if and only if there exists a left cancellative element a'∈R with a'R = aR. If a,a'∈R are two left cancellative elements, then aR  =  a'R if and only if a  =  a'ε for some ε∈U(R).

Let [formula] be n + 1 left cancellative elements and assume that [formula]. If [formula], then obviously also [formula]. This gives an equivalence relation on finite ordered sequences of left cancellative elements whose product is a. More precisely, if [formula] is left cancellative for every [formula] and [formula], then the equivalence relation ~   on Fa is defined by [formula] if n = m and there exist [formula] such that x'1 = x1ε1, x'i  =  ε- 1i - 1xiεi for all [formula] and x'n  =  ε- 1n - 1xn. In this paper, we call an equivalence class of Fa modulo ~   a factorization of a up to insertion of units. Notice that the factors need not be irreducible. When this causes no confusion, we will simply call a representative of such an equivalence class a factorization.

A factorization [formula] gives rise to an ascending chain of principal right ideals, generated by left cancellative elements and containing aR:

[formula]

hence to an ascending chain of cyclically presented submodules

[formula]

of the cyclically presented R-module R / aR. Notice that [formula] is cyclically presented because the elements xi are left cancellative.

The next lemma shows that, conversely, every chain of principal right ideals generated by left cancellative elements in aR  ⊂  R, determines a factorization of a into left cancellative elements, which is unique up to insertion of units.

Let a∈R be a left cancellative element, [formula] be an ascending chain of principal right ideals of R, where [formula] are left cancellative elements, y0 = 1 and yn = a. For every [formula] let xi∈R be such that yi - 1xi  =  yi. Then [formula] are left cancellative elements and [formula].

Moreover, if [formula] are also left cancellative elements with yi'R  =  yiR, y0' = 1 and yn' = a, and we similarly define xi' by y'i - 1xi'  =  yi' for every [formula], then there exist [formula] such that x'1 = x1ε1, x'i  =  ε- 1i - 1xiεi for all [formula] and x'n  =  ε- 1n - 1xn.

Assume that xi is not left cancellative for some [formula]. Then there exists b  ≠  0 such that xib = 0. Therefore yib = yi - 1xib = 0. This is a contradiction because yi is left cancellative. Notice that [formula].

Now if y'iR = yiR for every [formula], then there exists [formula] such that y'i = yiεi. Therefore y'i - 1x'i = yi - 1xiεi = y'i - 1ε- 1i - 1xiεi. But y'i - 1 is left cancellative, so that x'i  =  ε- 1i - 1xiεi for every [formula].

Moreover, y1 = y0x1 = x1 and, similarly, y1' = x1', so that y'1 = y1ε1 implies x'1 = x1ε1. Finally, yn - 1xn  =  yn = a = yn' = yn - 1'xn' = yn - 1εn - 1xn'. Thus xn  =  εn - 1xn' and xn' = ε- 1n - 1xn.

As we have already said in the introduction, we will characterize, in Lemmas [\ref=piexact] and [\ref=cuo], the submodules of cyclically presented modules MR that, under a suitable cyclic presentation π:RR  →  MR, that is, a suitable epimorphism π:RR  →  MR, lift to principal right ideals of R generated by a left cancellative element. The following lemma will prove to be helpful to this end.

Let AR,BR,MR,NR be modules over a ring R, πM:AR  →  MR and πN:BR  →  NR be epimorphisms, λ:BR  →  AR be a homomorphism and ε:NR  →  MR be a monomorphism such that πMλ  =  επN, so that there is a commutative diagram

[formula]

Then the following three conditions are equivalent:

π- 1M(ε(NR))  =  λ(BR).

λ( ker (πN))  =   ker (πM).

πM induces an isomorphism (λ)  →  (ε).

If, moreover, AR',BR' are right R-modules such that there exist isomorphisms φA:AR'  →  AR and φB:BR'  →  BR, and one defines πN': = πNφB, πM': = πMφA and λ': = φ- 1AλφB, then the three conditions (a), (b) and (c) are equivalent also to the the three conditions

(π'M)- 1(ε(NR))  =  λ'(B'R).

λ'( ker (π'N))  =   ker (π'M).

π'M induces an isomorphism (λ')  →  (ε).

(a)[formula](b): We have πMλ(BR) = επN(BR) = ε(NR). It follows that π- 1M(ε(NR))  =  λ(BR) +  ker πM. Thus (a) is equivalent to ker πM  ⊆  λ(BR). The inclusion λ( ker (πN))  ⊆   ker (πM) always holds by the commmutativity of the diagram, so that b is equivalent to ker (πM)  ⊆  λ( ker (πN)). Thus (b)[formula](a) is trivial. Conversely, if (a) holds, and a∈ ker (πM), then a = λ(b) for some b∈BR, so that 0 = πM(a) = πMλ(b) = επN(b). But ε is mono, so πN(b) = 0, and a = λ(b)∈λ( ker (πN)).

(b)[formula](c) Apply the Snake Lemma to the diagram

[formula]

obtaining a short exact sequence

[formula]

Therefore λ( ker (πN)) =  ker (πM) if and only if λ|ker is surjective, if and only if (λ|ker) = 0, if and only if the epimorphism (λ)  →  (ε) is injective, if and only if it is an isomorphism.

Now assume that there exist isomorphisms φA:AR'  →  AR and φB:BR'  →  BR and set πN': = πNφB, πM': = πMφA and λ': = φ- 1AλφB. To conclude the proof, it suffices to show that λ( ker (πN))  =   ker (πM) if and only if λ'( ker (πN'))  =   ker (πM'). This is true, since ker (πM')  =  φ- 1A( ker (πM)) and

[formula]

π-exactness

Let MR be a cyclically presented right R-module and πM:RR  →  MR a cyclic presentation. We introduce the notion of πM-exactness to characterize those submodules of MR that lift, via πM, to principal right ideals of R, generated by a left cancellative element of R. We give sufficient conditions on R for this notion to be independent from the chosen presentation πM.

[formula]. By , there exists an isomorphism λ0:RR  →  π- 1M(NR). Let λ be the composite mapping [formula] and ε- 1:ε(NR)  →  NR be the inverse of the corestriction of ε to ε(NR). Noticing that πMλ(RR) = ε(NR), one gets an onto mapping πN: = ε- 1πMλ:RR  →  NR. Then diagram [\eqref=eq:piexact-1] clearly commutes and λ(RR)  =  π- 1M(NR). The statement now follows from Lemma .

[formula] and [formula]. By Lemma .

Let [formula] and let πM:FR  →  MR be an epimorphism. If φ:F'R  →  FR is an isomorphism and NR  ≤  MR, then NR is a πM-exact submodule of MR if and only if it is a πMφ-exact submodule of MR.

Let NR be a πM-exact submodule of MR and let λ:RR  →  FR be a monomorphism satisfying condition [\ref=piexact:b] of Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact]. Apply Lemma to BR  =  BR'  =  RR, AR  =  FR, AR'  =  FR', φB  =  1R and φA  =  φ. Setting λ': = φ- 1λ, it follows that λ'( ker (πN))  =   ker (πMφ) and hence NR is a πMφ-exact submodule of MR. The converse follows applying what we have just shown to φ- 1.

Let NR  ≤  MR be cyclic R-modules, πM:RR  →  MR be an epimorphism and NR  ≤  MR be a πM-exact submodule. Then MR / NR is cyclically presented with presentation induced by πM.

Let λ:RR  →  RR be as in condition (c) of Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact]. Then [formula], from which the conclusion follows immediately.

Let NR  ≤  MR  ≤  PR be cyclic R-modules and let πP:FR  →  PR be an epimorphism, where [formula]. If MR  ≤  PR is πP-exact and NR  ≤  MR is πP|π- 1P(MR)-exact, then NR  ≤  PR is πP-exact.

Set F'R: = π- 1P(MR). By condition [\ref=piexact:a] of Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact], [formula]. Therefore the notion of πP|F'R-exactness of NR in MR is indeed defined. Since [formula], the claim follows.

Let c∈R be left cancellative and denote by [formula] the set of all right ideals aR with a∈R left cancellative and cR  ⊂  aR  ⊂  R. It is partially ordered by set inclusion. Let π:R  →  R / cR be an epimorphism. Denote by [formula] the set of all π-exact submodules of R / cR. This set is also partially ordered by set inclusion.

Let c∈R be left cancellative and let π:RR  →  R / cR be the canonical epimorphism. Then π induces an isomorphism of partially ordered sets [formula].

It suffices to show that NR  ⊂  R / cR is π-exact if and only if there exists a left cancellative a∈R with π- 1(NR)  =  aR. But this is equivalent to [formula]. The statement now follows from condition Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact:a] of [\ref=piexact].

The following example shows that, in general, the condition of π-exactness indeed depends on the particular choice of the epimorphism π:RR  →  MR. We refer the reader to any of [\cite=Maclachlan-Reid_'03], [\cite=Reiner_'75] or [\cite=Vigneras_'80] for the necessary background on quaternion algebras.

However, under an additional assumption on RR, which holds, for instance, whenever R is a semilocal ring, the notion is independent of the choice of π.

Suppose that [formula] implies [formula] for all right ideals KR of R.

If [formula] with a∈R left cancellative and πM:RR  →  MR is an epimorphism, then there exists a left cancellative a'∈R such that ker (πM)  =  a'R.

If MR is a cyclic R-module, πM:RR  →  MR and πM':RR  →  MR are epimorphisms and NR  ≤  MR, then NR is a πM-exact submodule of MR if and only if it is a πM'-exact submodule of MR.

(1) Let πaR:RR  →  R / aR,1  ↦  1  +  aR be the canonical epimorphism. Since a is left cancellative, [formula]. Consider the exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

By Schanuel's Lemma, [formula], and hence by assumption [formula]. Thus there exists a left cancellative a'∈R with ker (πM)  =  a'R.

(2) Let πM / N:MR  →  MR / NR be the canonical quotient module epimorphism. There are exact sequences

[formula]

and

[formula]

and by Schanuel's Lemma therefore [formula]. If NR is a πM-exact submodule of MR, then [formula] and hence [formula] by our assumption on R, showing that NR is a πM'-exact submodule. The converse follows by symmetry.

Suppose that R has invariant basis number (for all [formula], [formula] implies m  =  n). Then the condition of the previous lemma is satisfied if every stably free R-module of rank 1 is free [\cite=McConnell-Robson_'01]. This is true if R is commutative [\cite=McConnell-Robson_'01]. The condition is also true if R is semilocal [\cite=Facchini_'98] or R is a 2-fir (by [\cite=Cohn_'85]).

Let MR be a right R-module with an epimorphism πM:RR  →  MR with ker (πM)  =  aR and a∈R left cancellative. We say that a finite series

[formula]

of submodules is πM-exact, if every Mi is an πM|π- 1M(Mi + 1)-exact submodule of Mi + 1. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:bij-posets] the πM-exact series of submodules of R are in bijection with series of principal right ideals in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:fact-chain] they are therefore in bijection with factorizations of a into left cancellative elements, up to insertion of units.

Recall that a ring R is a 2-fir if and only if it is a domain and the sum of any two principal right ideals with non-zero intersection is again a principal right ideal [\cite=Cohn_'85]. In the next theorem, we will consider, for a cyclically presented right R-module MR and a cyclic presentation πM:RR  →  MR with non-zero kernel, the set of all submodules of cyclically presented πM-exact submodules. We say it is closed under finite sums if for every two cyclically presented πM-exact submodules M1 and M2 of MR, the sum M1  +  M2 also is cyclically presented and a πM-exact submodule of MR.

Let R be a domain. The following are equivalent.

For every cyclically presented right R-module MR and every cyclic presentation πM:RR  →  MR with non-zero kernel, the set of all cyclically presented πM-exact submodules is closed under finite sums.

R is a 2-fir.

(1) ⇒   (2): Let [formula] be such that [formula]. We have to show that aR  +  bR is right principal. Let MR  =  R / cR, πM:RR  →  R / cR be the canonical epimorphism, M1  =  aR  /  cR and M2  =  bR  /  cR. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:bij-posets], M1  =  πM(aR) and M2  =  πM(bR) are πM-exact submodules of MR. By assumption M1  +  M2 is a πM-exact submodule of MR. Again by Lemma [\ref=lemma:bij-posets], aR  +  bR  =  π- 1M(M1  +  M2) is a principal right ideal of R, generated by a left cancellative element.

(2) ⇒   (1): We may assume M1,M2  ≠  0, as the statement is trivial otherwise. Let πM:RR  →  MR be an epimorphism with non-zero kernel. Since M1 and M2 are πM-exact submodules of MR, there exist [formula] such that π- 1(M1)  =  aR and π- 1(M2)  =  bR. Because ker (π)  ≠  0, we have [formula]. Since R is a 2-fir, there exists [formula] such that aR  +  bR  =  π- 1M(M1  +  M2)  =  cR. Therefore M1  +  M2 is cyclically presented and a πM-exact submodule of MR.

Notice that if we assume that sums and intersections of exact submodules are again exact submodules, one may use the Artin-Schreier and Jordan-Hölder-Theorems to study factorizations of elements. As we have just seen, such an assumption leads to the 2-firs investigated by Cohn in [\cite=Cohn_'85].

Projective covers of cyclically presented modules

Let R be a ring and R / xR a cyclically presented right R-module, x∈R. The module R / xR does not have a projective cover in general, but if it has one, it has one of the form π|eR:eR  →  R / xR, where e∈R is an idempotent that depends on x and π|eR is the restriction to eR of the canonical projection π:RR  →  R / xR [\cite=AF2]. More precisely, given any projective cover p:PR  →  R / xR, there is an isomorphism f:eR  →  PR such that pf = π|eR. The kernel of the projective cover π|eR:eR  →  R / xR is [formula] and is contained in eJ(R) because the kernel of π|eR is a superfluous submodule of eR and eJ(R) is the largest superfluous submodule of eR. Considering the exact sequences 0  →  xR  →  RR  →  R / xR  →  0 and [formula], one sees that [formula] (Schanuel's Lemma), so that [formula] can be generated with at most two elements.

Recall that every right R-module has a projective cover if and only if the ring R is perfect, and that every finitely generated right R-module has a projective cover if and only every simple right R-module has a projective cover, if and only if the ring R is semiperfect. Denoting by J(R) the Jacobson radical of R, R is semiperfect if and only if R / J(R) is semisimple and idempotents can be lifted modulo J(R) [\cite=AF2]. The next result gives a similar characterization for the rings R over which every cyclically presented right module has a projective cover.

The following conditions are equivalent for a ring R with Jacobson radical J(R):

(1) Every cyclically presented right R-module has a projective cover.

(2) The ring R / J(R) is Von Neumann regular and idempotents can be lifted modulo J(R).

Set J: = J(R).

(1)[formula](2) Assume that every cyclically presented right R-module has a projective cover. In order to show that R / J is Von Neumann regular, it suffices to prove that every principal right ideal of R / J is a direct summand of the right R / J-module R / J [\cite=Goodearl_'91]. Let x be an element of R. We will show that (xR + J) / J is a direct summand of R / J as a right R / J-module. By (1), the cyclically presented right R-module R / xR has a projective cover. As we have seen above, the projective cover is of the form π|eR:eR  →  R / xR for some idempotent e of R, where π:RR  →  R / xR is the canonical projection.

Applying the right exact functor [formula] to the short exact sequence [formula], we get an exact sequence [formula], which can be rewritten as [formula]. It follows that there is a short exact sequence [formula]. Now the kernel [formula] of the projective cover π|eR is superfluous in eR and eJ is the largest superfluous submodule of eR, hence [formula] and [formula].

Now [formula], so that [formula] is a projective right R / J-module. Thus the short exact sequence 0  →  (x + J)(R / J) = (xR + J) / J  →  R / J  →  R / (xR + J)  →  0 splits, and the principal right ideal of R / J generated by x + J is a direct summand of the right R / J-module R / J.

We must now prove that idempotents of R / J lift modulo J. By [\cite=AF2], this is equivalent to showing that every direct summand of the R-module R / J has a projective cover. Let MR be a direct summand of (R / J)R. Then it is also a direct summand of (R / J)R / J and hence is generated by an idempotent of R / J. Let g∈R be such that g + J∈R / J is idempotent and MR / J  =  (g  +  J)(R / J). Then [formula] as R / J-modules, and hence also as R-modules. The canonical projection πg:R / J  →  MR has kernel ker (πg)  =  (1 - g  +  J)(R / J). Let π:RR  →  R / J,r  ↦  r + J be the canonical epimorphism. Set f:  =  πgπ. Then ker (f)  =  (1 - g)R  +  J and so f factors through an epimorphism [formula] with [formula]. In particular, [formula] is the image of the superfluous submodule J of RR via the canonical projection RR  →  R / (1 - g)R. It follows that [formula] is superfluous in R / (1 - g)R, i.e., [formula] is a superfluous epimorphism.

By hypothesis, there is a projective cover p:PR  →  R / (1 - g)R. Since the composite mapping of two superfluous epimorphisms is a superfluous epimorphism (this follows easily from [\cite=AF2]), [formula] is a superfluous epimorphism and hence a projective cover of M.

(2)[formula](1) Assume that (2) holds. Let R / xR be a cyclically presented right R-module, where x∈R. The principal right ideal (x + J)(R / J) of the Von Neumann regular ring R / J is generated by an idempotent and idempotents can be lifted modulo J. Hence there exists an idempotent element e∈R such that (x + J)(R / J) = (e + J)(R / J). Let π|(1 - e)R be the restriction to (1 - e)R of the canonical epimorphism π:RR  →  R / xR. We claim that π|(1 - e)R:(1 - e)R  →  R / xR is onto. To prove the claim, notice that xR + J = eR + J, so that (1 - e)R + xR + J = R. As J is superfluous in RR, it follows that (1 - e)R + xR = R and so π|(1 - e)R is onto. This proves our claim. Finally, [formula], so that [formula] is superfluous in (1 - e)R. Thus π|(1 - e)R is the required projective cover of the cyclically presented R-module R / xR.

If R is a domain and every cyclically presented right R-module has a projective cover, then R is local.

By the previous Theorem, R / J(R) is Von Neumann regular. Since idempotents lift modulo J(R), the only idempotents of R / J(R) are 0 and 1. Therefore R / J(R) is a division ring and so R is local

Notice that, conversely, if R is a local ring and MR is any non-zero cyclic module, then every epimorphism π:RR  →  MR is a projective cover.

Let R be an arbitrary ring, let NR  ≤  MR be cyclic right R-modules with a projective cover and let ε:NR  →  MR be the embedding. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:

There exist a projective cover πN:PR  →  NR of NR, a projective cover πM:QR  →  MR of MR and a commutative diagram of right R-module morphisms

[formula]

such that the following equivalent conditions hold:

λ(PR)  =  π- 1M(ε(NR));

λ( ker (πN)) =  ker (πM);

πM induces an isomorphism (λ)  →  (ε).

For every pair of projective covers πN:PR  →  NR of NR and πM:QR  →  MR of MR and every commutative diagram [\eqref=1'] of right R-module morphisms, the following equivalent conditions hold:

λ(PR)  =  π- 1M(ε(NR));

λ( ker (πN)) =  ker (πM);

πM induces an isomorphism (λ)  →  (ε).

The equivalences (a)[formula](b)[formula](c) and (a')[formula](b')[formula](c') have been proved in Lemma .

(b)[formula](b'): Assume that πN:PR  →  NR, πM:QR  →  MR and λ:PR  →  QR satisfy condition (b), that is, make diagram ([\ref=1']) commute and λ( ker (πN)) =  ker (πM). Let π'N:P'R  →  NR and π'M:Q'R  →  MR be projective covers and λ':P'R  →  Q'R be a morphism that make the diagram corresponding to diagram ([\ref=1']) commute, that is, such that π'Mλ' = επ'N. Projective covers are unique up to isomorphism and, by Lemma , we may therefore assume P'R  =  PR, Q'R  =  QR and πM'  =  πM, πN'  =  πN.

Then πM(λ  -  λ') = πMλ  -  επN  =  επN  -  επN = 0, so that (λ  -  λ')(PR)  ⊆   ker πM. Let ι: ker πM  →  QR denote the inclusion. Then there exists a morphism ψ:PR  →   ker πM such that λ  -  λ' = ιψ. As images via module morphisms of superfluous submodules are superfluous submodules and ker πN is a superfluous submodule of PR, it follows that ψ( ker πN) is a superfluous submodule of ker πM. Now ker πM  =  λ( ker πN) = (λ' + ιψ)( ker πN)  ⊆  λ'( ker πN) + ιψ( ker πN) = λ'( ker πN) + ψ( ker πN)  ⊆   ker πM. Thus ker πM  =  λ'( ker πN) + ψ( ker πN). But ψ( ker πN) is superfluous in ker πM, hence ker πM  =  λ'( ker πN), which proves (b').

(b')[formula](b): Let πN:PR  →  NR and πM:QR  →  MR be projective covers of NR, respectively MR. Since PR is projective and πM:QR  →  M is an epimorphism, there exists a λ:PR  →  QR such that πMλ  =  επN. By (b'), then λ( ker (πN))  =   ker (πM).

If NR  ≤  MR are cyclic right R-modules and the equivalent conditions of Theorem [\ref=cuo] are satisfied, we say that NR is an exact submodule of MR.

If LR  ≤  MR  ≤  NR are cyclic right R-modules, MR is exact in NR and LR is exact in MR, then LR is exact in NR.

Since LR is exact in MR and MR is exact in NR, there exist projective covers πL:PR  →  LR, πM:QR  →  MR, πM':QR'  →  MR and πN:UR  →  NR and homomorphisms λ:PR  →  QR and μ:QR'  →  UR such that πMλ  =  πL, πNμ  =  πM', λ( ker (πL))  =   ker (πM) and μ( ker (πM'))  =   ker (πN).

Since the projective cover of MR is unique up to isomorphism, we may assume by Lemma that QR  =  QR' and πM' = πM (replacing λ accordingly). Then πNμλ  =  πMλ  =  πL and ker (πN)  =  μ( ker (πM))  =  μ(λ( ker (πL))  =  (μλ)( ker (πL)). Therefore NR is an exact submodule of MR.

If a cyclic module NR is an exact submodule of a cyclic module MR and MR has a projective cover isomorphic to RR, then MR / NR is cyclically presented.

Since NR is an exact submodule of MR, there exists a commutative diagram where πN:PR  →  NR and πM:QR  →  MR are projective covers of NR and MR and [formula]. By assumption, there exists an idempotent e∈R such that [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma , we may therefore assume PR  =  eR and QR  =  RR (replacing πM, πN and λ accordingly). Therefore [formula]. Hence MR / NR is cyclically presented.

The following example shows that if R is not a domain, then even if a non-unit x∈R is not a zero-divisor, the projective cover of R / xR need not be isomorphic to RR.

The next example shows that the condition for the projective cover of MR to be isomorphic to RR is necessary in Corollary [\ref=cor:cp].

Let R be a local domain. Let NR,MR  ≠  0 be cyclically presented right R-modules and let πM:RR  →  MR be an epimorphism. Then NR  ⊂  MR is exact if and only if it is πM-exact in the sense of Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact].

Suppose first NR  ⊂  MR exact. Let πN:RR  →  NR be any epimorphism. Then πM and πN are necessarily projective covers, because ker (πM) and ker (πN) are superfluous. Let ε:NR  →  MR denote the inclusion. By projectivity of RR, there exists a λ:RR  →  RR such that πMλ  =  επN. By condition (a) in Lemma [\ref=cuo], λ(RR)  =  π- 1M(NR). Since π- 1M(NR)  ≠  0, it follows that [formula] and hence condition (a) in Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact] is satisfied.

Suppose now that NR  ⊂  MR is πM-exact. Let πN:RR  →  NR be an epimorphism and λ:RR  →  RR a monomorphism satisfying condition (b) of Definition and Lemma [\ref=piexact]. Then πN is a projective cover of NR, and condition (b) of Lemma [\ref=cuo] is satisfied, implying that NR  ⊂  MR is exact.

The previous proposition, together with the results from the previous section, shows that in the special case of R a local domain and x∈R a non-unit, series of exact submodules of R / xR may be used to study factorizations of x∈R up to insertion of units.

Cokernels of endomorphisms

Let MR be a right module over a ring R and let E: = (MR) be its endomorphism ring. Let s be a fixed element of E. In this section, we investigate the relation between projective covers eE  →  E / sE for an idempotent e, induced by the canonical epimorphism EE  →  E / sE, and properties of the module e(MR). This is of particular interest if we assume that E / J(E) is Von Neumann regular and idempotents can be lifted modulo J(E), as in this case for every non-zero s∈E the module E / sE has a projective cover. For instance, every continuous module MR has this property [\cite=SM], in particular every quasi-injective module has this property, and every module of Goldie dimension one and dual Goldie dimension one has this property [\cite=SM].

Let s:MR  →  MR be an endomorphism of MR. We can consider the direct summands M1 of MR such that there exists a direct sum decomposition [formula] of MR for some complement M2 of M1 with the property that π2s:MR  →  M2 is a split epimorphism. Here π2:MR  →  M2 is the canonical projection with kernel M1. Let [formula] be the set of all such direct summands, that is,

[formula]

The set [formula] can be partially ordered by set inclusion.

It is well known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all pairs (M1,M2) of R-submodules of MR such that [formula] and the set of all idempotents e∈E. If e∈E is an idempotent, the corresponding pair is the pair (M1: = e(MR),M2: = (1 - e)(MR)). If s∈(MR), we always denote by φ:EE  →  E / sE the canonical epimorphism φ(f)  =  f  +  sE.

Let [formula], let π2:MR  →  M2 be the projection with kernel M1, and let e∈(MR) be the endomorphism corresponding to the pair (M1,M2). If s:MR  →  MR is an endomorphism, then π2s is a split epimorphism if and only if φ|eE:eE  →  E / sE is surjective.

We have to show that π2s:MR  →  M2 is a split epimorphism if and only if eE + sE = E. In order to prove the claim, assume that π2s:MR  →  M2 is a split epimorphism, so that there is an R-module morphism f:M2  →  MR with π2sf = 1M2. Let ε2:M2  →  MR be the embedding. Then the right ideal eE + sE of E contains the endomorphism

[formula]

so that eE + sE = E. Conversely, let e∈E be an idempotent with eE + sE = E, so that there exist g,h∈E with 1 = eg + sh. Then (1 - e) = (1 - e)sh, so that (1 - e) = (1 - e)sh(1 - e), that is, ε2π2  =  ε2π2shε2π2. Since ε2 is injective and π2 is surjective, they can be canceled, so that 1M2  =  π2shε2. Hence π2s is a split epimorphism, which proves our claim.

Let MR be a right module, and let E: = (MR) be its endomorphism ring. Let s∈E and suppose that E / sE has a projective cover. Then

[formula]

has minimal elements, and all minimal elements of [formula] are isomorphic R-submodules of MR.

From the previous lemma, it follows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set [formula] of all pairs (M1,M2) of R-submodules of MR such that [formula] and π2s:MR  →  M2 is a split epimorphism and the set of all idempotents e∈E for which the canonical mapping eE  →  EE / sE, x∈eE  ↦  x + sE, is surjective. In order to prove that [formula] has minimal elements, it suffices to show that if the canonical mapping eE  →  EE / sE is a projective cover, then e(MR) is a minimal element of [formula]. Let e∈E be such that eE  →  EE / sE is a projective cover, and let [formula] be such that M'1  ⊆  e(MR). Let e'∈E be an idempotent such that M'1 = e'(MR) and π'2s:MR  →  (1 - e')(MR) is a split epimorphism. Then M'1 = e'(MR)  ⊆  e(MR), so that ee' = e'. Thus e'E = ee'E  ⊆  eE. If φ|eE:eE  →  E / sE is the projective cover, φ|e'E:e'E  →  E / sE denotes the canonical epimorphism and ε:e'E  →  eE is the embedding, it follows that φ|eEε  =  φ|e'E. Now φ|eE is a superfluous epimorphism and φ|eEε  =  φ|e'E is onto, so that ε is onto, that is, e'E = eE. Thus e = e'f for some f∈E, so that e(MR)  ⊆  e'(MR) = M'1 and M'1 = e(MR). It follows that e(MR) is a minimal element of [formula].

Now let M''1 be any other minimal element of [formula], and let e'' be an idempotent element of E with π''2s:MR  →  (1 - e'')(MR) a split epimorphism. Then the canonical projection e''E  →  E / sE is an epimorphism. As the canonical projection φ|eE:eE  →  E / sE is the projective cover, there is a direct sum decomposition [formula] with the canonical projection P'E  →  E / sE a projective cover. Thus P'E = p'E for some idempotent p' of E with p'E + sE = E, so that [formula]. Now e''E  ⊇  P'E = p'E implies that p' = e''g for some g∈E, so that p'(MR)  ⊆  e''(MR) = M''1. By the minimality of M''1 in [formula], it follows that p'(MR) = e''(MR), so that [formula]. Thus every minimal element of [formula] is isomorphic to e(MR).

We conclude the paper by considering quasi-projective modules. Let MR and NR be right R-modules. Recall that MR is NR-projective if for every epimorphism f:NR  →  LR and every homomorphism g:MR  →  LR there exists a homomorphism h:MR  →  NR such that g = fh. Equivalently, for every epimorphism f:NR  →  LR, the induced homomorphism f*:R(MR,NR)  →  R(MR,LR) is surjective. If MR is NR-projective and KR  ≤  NR, then MR is also KR-projective [\cite=AF2]. A right R-module MR is quasi-projective if it is MR-projective. Trivially, projective modules and semisimple modules are quasi-projective.

Let MR be quasi-projective, E: = R(MR) and suppose s∈E. In the following, we relate projective covers of the R-module MR / s(MR) and the cyclically presented E-module E / sE.

Let MR be a quasi-projective right R-module, E the endomorphism ring of MR and let s∈E. Let π be the canonical epimorphism of MR onto MR / s(MR) and φ the canonical epimorphism of EE onto E / sE.

For every g∈E, π|g(MR) is surjective if and only if φ|gE is surjective.

For every g∈E, gE is a direct summand of EE if and only if g(MR) is a direct summand of MR.

Let e,e' be idempotents in E. Then [formula] if and only if [formula].

Let e∈E be idempotent. Then ker (π|e(MR)) is superfluous if and only if ker (φ|eE) is superfluous.

(1) ([formula]) Since φ|gE is surjective, there exists h in E such that gh + sE = 1M + sE. Hence there exists h' in E such that gh = 1M + sh'. For all m∈MR we have π(m)  =  π(1M(m))  =  π(g(h(m)), whence π|g(MR) is surjective.

([formula]) Since MR is quasi-projective and πg:MR  →  MR is an epimorphism, there exists h:MR  →  MR such that πgh = π. Therefore (gh - 1M)(MR)  ⊂  s(MR). Since s:MR  →  s(MR) is an epimorphism, quasi-projectivity of MR implies that there exists h'∈E such that gh - 1M = sh'. This implies that φ(gh) = 1M + sE. Therefore φ|gE is surjective.

(2) ([formula]) If gE is a direct summand of E, there exists an idempotent e in E such that gE = eE. Hence there exist h,h' in E such that g = eh and e = gh'. This implies that g(MR) = e(MR). On the other hand, e(MR) is a direct summand of MR since e is an idempotent of E. Therefore g(MR) is a direct summand of MR.

([formula]) If g(MR) is a direct summand of E, there exists an idempotent e in E such that g(MR) = e(MR). Hence eg = g. Therefore gE  ⊂  eE. Since g:MR  →  e(MR) is an epimorphism and MR is quasi-projective, there exists h:MR  →  MR such that e = gh. This implies that eE  ⊂  gE. Hence eE = gE.

(3) ([formula]) Since [formula], there exists an isomorphism Γ:eE  →  e'E. Consider the two following homomorphisms f:e(MR)  →  e'(MR) defined via f(m) = e'x(m) where e'x = Γ(e) and g:e'(MR)  →  e(MR) defined via g(m) = ey(m) where ey = Γ- 1(e'). It suffices to show that fg = 1e'(MR) and gf = 1e(MR). For m∈e'(MR), fg(m) = f(ey(m)) = e'xey(m) = e'xy(m) = Γ(e)y(m) = Γ(ey)(m) = Γ(Γ- 1(e'))(m) = e'(m) = m, it follows that fg = 1e'(MR). By an argument analogous to the previous one, we get gf = 1e(MR).

([formula]) Since [formula], there exists an isomorphism h:e(MR)  →  e'(MR). Consider the two following homomorphisms θ:eE  →  e'E defined via θ(ex) = e'hex, and θ':e'E  →  eE defined via θ'(e'x) = eh- 1e'x. It suffices to show that θθ' = 1e'E and θ'θ = 1eE. Since θθ'(e'x)(m) = θ(eh- 1e'x)(m) = e'heh- 1e'x(m) = e'he(h- 1(e'x(m))) = e'h(h- 1(e'x(m))) = e'e'(x(m)) = e'(x(m)), it follows that θθ'(e'x) = e'x. Hence θθ' = 1e'E. By an argument analogous to the previous one, we get θ'θ = 1eE.

(4) ([formula]) Let KE be a submodule of eE such that KE  +   ker (φ|eE) = eE. It suffices to show that KE = eE. There exists [formula] and k∈KE such that e = k + h. Hence e(MR) = k(MR) + h(MR). This implies that [formula]. Since [formula] is superfluous in e(MR), then e(MR) = k(MR). Since k:MR  →  e(MR) is an epimorphism and MR is quasi-projective, there exists h' in E such that e = kh'. This implies that e∈KE. Therefore KE = eE.

([formula]) Let NR be a submodule of MR such that NR  +   ker (π|e(MR)) = MR. Hence π|NR is surjective. It suffices to show that NR = MR. Since MR is quasi-projective and NR is a submodule of MR, it follows that MR is also NR-projective. Therefore the induced homomorphism (π|NR)*:(MR,NR)  →  (MR,MR / s(MR)) is surjective and hence there exists g:MR  →  NR such that πg = πe. Again by quasi-projectivity of MR, there exists h:MR  →  MR such that g - e = sh. Since g(MR)  ⊂  NR  ⊂  e(MR), for every x∈MR there exists y∈MR such that g(x) = e(y). We have eg(x) = e(e(y)) = e(y) = g(x). Thus eg = g. Since g - e = eg - e = sh, eg - e∈eE and sh∈sE, it follows that [formula]. From e = g - (g - e), we have eE = gE + (g - e)E. Hence [formula]. Since [formula] is superfluous, eE = gE. Therefore e(MR) = g(MR)  ⊂  NR. Thus NR = e(MR).

Let MR be a projective right R-module and E the endomorphism ring of MR. Let s∈E and let π be the canonical epimorphism from MR to MR / s(MR) and φ the canonical epimorphism from E to E / sE. Then π|e(MR) is a projective cover of MR / s(MR) if and only if φ|eE is a projective cover of E / sE.

Since MR is projective, so is e(MR). Hence π|e(MR) is a projective cover if and only if ker (π|e(MR)) is superfluous. Therefore the corollary follows from the previous lemma.

Let MR be a quasi-projective right R-module, let s∈E = (MR) and let π:MR  →  MR / s(MR) be the canonical epimorphism. Suppose that E / sE has a projective cover.

Consider [formula] and [formula], both partially ordered by set inclusion. Then [formula] has minimal elements, any two minimal elements of [formula] are isomorphic as right R-modules and any minimal element of [formula] is minimal in E.

Let NR  ≤  MR be a direct summand of MR, let e∈E be an idempotent with e(MR) = NR and let π2:MR  →   ker (e) be the canonical projection corresponding to the direct sum decomposition [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lemma:endo](1) implies that π|NR:NR  →  MR / s(MR) is surjective if and only if φ|eE:eE  →  E / sE is surjective. By Lemma [\ref=lemma:surj-equi] this is the case if and only if π2s is a split epimorphism. This shows that [formula], where the latter is defined as in Proposition [\ref=prop:min-splitepi]. The claims about [formula] therefore follow from the proposition.

It remains to show that the minimal elements of [formula] are minimal in E. Let [formula] be minimal, and let e:MR  →  NR be an idempotent with e(MR)  =  NR. From the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:min-splitepi], we see that eE  →  E / sE is a projective cover. Therefore Lemma [\ref=lemma:endo](4) implies that ker (π|NR) is superfluous. Therefore, if LR  ≤  NR and π|LR is surjective, we have LR  +   ker (π|NR)  =  NR and hence LR  =  NR, showing that NR is minimal in E.
