Introduction

The (naï ve) height H(P) of an integer polynomial P(x) is the maximum of the absolute values of its coefficients. For a separable integer polynomial P(x) of degree d  ≥  2 and with distinct roots [formula], we set

[formula]

and define the quantity e(P) by

[formula]

Following the notation introduced in [\cite=BM2], for d  ≥  2, we set

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the latter limsup is taken over the irreducible integer polynomials P(x) of degree d. We further define e*(d) and e*irr(d) by restricting to monic, respectively, monic irreducible integer polynomials, of degree d. Obviously, we have

[formula]

A classical result of Mahler [\cite=Mah64] asserts that e(d)  ≤  d - 1 for every d  ≥  2 and it is easy to check that eirr(2) = e(2) = 1 and e*(2) = e*irr(2)  =  0.

The determination of the exact values of e(d),e*(d),eirr(d) and e*irr(d) has been investigated by several authors over the past ten years. Evertse [\cite=Ev] and Schönhage [\cite=Sch] proved, independently, that eirr(3) = e(3) = 2. Rather surprisingly, no other known value of e(d) is known. The following inequalities gather the lower bounds obtained by Beresnevich, Bernik, Bugeaud, Dujella, Götze, and Mignotte in the four papers [\cite=BM1] [\cite=BM2] [\cite=BBG] [\cite=BD]:

and

[formula]

See also [\cite=DP] for a constructive proof that e*(4)  ≥  2 and [\cite=Dub] for the study of analogous quantities defined in terms of the Remak height (instead of the naï ve height).

The aim of the present paper is to improve all known lower bounds for e(d), e*(d) and e*irr(d) for d sufficiently large.

For any integer d  ≥  4, we have

[formula]

We obtain a slightly weaker lower bound when we restrict our attention to monic polynomials.

For any even positive integer d  ≥  6, we have

[formula]

For any odd positive integer d  ≥  7, we have

[formula]

Roughly speaking, all the previously known lower bounds were of order d / 2. There are many other questions on integer polynomials of degree d, or on algebraic numbers of degree d, for which the answer is known to lie somewhere between d / 2 and d. The most celebrated one is the problem of Wirsing on the approximation to transcendental real numbers by algebraic numbers of degree at most d; see Chapter 3 of [\cite=BuLiv]. We stress that the lower bounds in Theorems [\ref=tm1] and [\ref=tm2] are of the order 2d / 3. As far as we are aware, this is the first time where an estimate of order θd with θ  >  1 / 2 is obtained for such kind of questions.

As pointed out in [\cite=Bu1], irreducible polynomials with close roots are useful to investigate the difference between Mahler's and Koksma's classifications of real numbers. However, it does not seem to us that Theorem [\ref=tm1] could be applied to this question to improve Corollary 1 of [\cite=BD].

To prove Theorems 1 and 2 we construct parametric families of integer polynomials. For an integer d  ≥  4, the reducible polynomials arising in the proof of Theorem 1 are products of a linear polynomial Ln(x)  =  (n2  +  3n + 1)x  -  (n + 2) with an irreducible polynomial pd - 1,n(x) of degree d - 1 and height of order n. We then show that pd - 1,n(x) has a root yd,n very close to the root xn  =  (n + 2) / (n2  +  3n  +  1) of Ln(x). Say differently, we construct a parametric family (yd,n)n  ≥  1 of algebraic numbers of degree d - 1 which are very well approximated by a rational number with large height (in comparison to the height of yd,n). This means that it is then possible to apply Bombieri's version of the Thue-Siegel principle [\cite=Bom] to the anchor pair (yd,n,xn) to derive a rather good effective irrationality measure for yd,n when n is sufficiently large in comparison to d. In his paper, Bombieri used the polynomials xd  -  nx  +  1, which have a root very close to the rational number 1 / n.

In our last result, we improve the known lower bound for e*irr(d) when d is large enough.

For any positive integer d  ≥  4, we have

[formula]

Throughout the next sections, the constants implied by the symbols O, ≪   and ≫   can be explicitly computed, are independent of the parameter n, and depend at most on the degree d.

Reducible polynomials: Proof of Theorem [\ref=tm1]

We want to construct a one-parametric sequence of integer polynomials pd,n(x) of degree d having a root very close to the rational number xn = (n + 2) / (n2 + 3n + 1). Then the polynomials

[formula]

will have two roots very close to each other. We define the sequence pd,n(x) recursively by

[formula]

We claim that

[formula]

Indeed, (2) is clearly true for d = 0 and d = 1. Assume now that d  ≥  1 is an integer for which (2) holds for pd - 1,n(x) and pd,n(x). Then we deduce from the recursion (1) that

[formula]

as claimed.

We now show that for sufficiently large n the polynomial pd,n(x) has a root between xn and

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

By Rolle's theorem, there exists z'd,n between xn and zd,n such that

[formula]

It follows easily by induction that

[formula]

Since xn = 1 / n + O(1 / n2), we have p'd,n(z'd,n)  =  n  +  d  +  O(1 / n). Thus, for sufficiently large n, we get p'd,n(z'd,n)  >  n. This implies that

[formula]

Therefore, the polynomial Pd,n(x) = ((n2 + 3n + 1)x - (n + 2))pd - 1,n(x) has two close roots: xn and yd,n, which is between xn and zd - 1,n. This yields

[formula]

when n is large enough. Since the height of Pd,n(x) is bounded from above by n3 times a number depending only on d, this gives

[formula]

by letting n tend to infinity. The proof of Theorem [\ref=tm1] is complete.

By Gelfond's inequality (see e.g. [\cite=BuLiv]), the height of yd,n is ≪  n. Liouville's inequality (see e.g. [\cite=BuLiv]) then implies that

[formula]

where δ denotes the degree of yd,n. Combined with (3), this gives δ  =  d - 1 and establishes that the polynomial pd - 1,n(x) must be irreducible. Also, (3) shows that Liouville's inequality

[formula]

is sharp in terms of n.

Reducible monic polynomials: Proof of Theorem [\ref=tm2]

In order to get a family of monic polynomials with similar separation properties as the family Pd,n(x), we replace the linear non-monic polynomial Ln(x) = (n2 + 3n + 1)x - (n + 2) by the monic quadratic polynomial

[formula]

Thus, we want to construct a one-parametric sequence of integer polynomials qd,n(x) of degree d having a root very close to the root yn = 1 / n + O(1 / n2) of Kn(x). Then the polynomials

[formula]

will have two roots very close to each other.

For d  ≥  0 even, we define the sequence qd,n(x) recursively by

[formula]

We claim that qd,n(x) - qd - 2,n(x)q2,n(x) is divisible by Kn(x). This is easy to check for d = 2 and d = 4, and then the claim follows by induction using the recursion (4). This yields that

[formula]

for d  ≥  2 even. From

[formula]

we get q2,n(yn) = 1 / n4  +  O(1 / n5) and hence

[formula]

We now show that for sufficiently large n the polynomial qd,n(x) has a root between yn and [formula]. We have

[formula]

By Rolle's theorem, there exists w'd,n between yn and wd,n such that

[formula]

It follows easily by induction that

[formula]

Since yn = 1 / n + O(1 / n2), we have q'd,n(w'd,n)  =   - n  -  d / 2  +  O(1 / n). Thus, for sufficiently large n, we get q'd,n(w'd,n)  <   - n. This implies

[formula]

Thus, the polynomial Qd,n(x) = (x2  -  (n2 + 3n + 1)x + (n + 2))qd - 2,n(x) has two close roots: yn and vd,n, which is between yn and wd - 2,n. This yields

[formula]

when n is large enough. Since H(Qd,n) = O(n3), this gives

[formula]

by letting n tend to infinity.

Let now d be odd. Then we define

[formula]

This polynomial has two close roots: yn and a root lying between yn and wd - 3,n. Thus we get

[formula]

for n large enough, and

[formula]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=tm2] is complete.

Irreducible monic polynomials: Proof of Theorem [\ref=tm3]

In this section, we use the polynomials pd,n(x) to construct irreducible monic polynomials having two very close roots. Let Fk denote the kth Fibonacci number defined by the recursion F0 = 0, F1 = 1 and Fk = Fk - 1 + Fk - 2 for k  ≥  2. Note that Fibonacci numbers appear in the asymptotic expansion of xn  =  (n + 2)  /  (n2  +  3n  +  1), namely

[formula]

For d  ≥  0, we first define monic polynomials sd,n(x) with a root close to xn by

[formula]

and then monic polynomials with two close roots by

[formula]

We claim that these polynomials are monic. It suffices to show that this is true for sd,n(x). Since the leading coefficient of pd,n(x) is Fdn  +  Fd - 2, we deduce that the leading coefficient of sd,n(x) is equal to

[formula]

From (2) we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

Observe that the degree of the polynomial rd,n(x) is d. We claim that rd,n(x) has two complex conjugate roots vd,n and [formula] close to xn, more precisely they are equal to

[formula]

Indeed, the polynomials F2dp2d,n(x) and F2d - 1xp2d - 1,n(x) have double roots yd + 1,n and yd,n, resp., in the disc |x - xn|  ≤  1 / n2d + 1, resp. |x - xn|  ≤  1 / n2d - 1. Moreover, we have F2dp2d,n(x)  <  xs2d,n(x) when |x - xn|  =  1 / n2d + 1 and F2d - 1xp2d - 1,n(x)  <  s2d,n(x) when |x - xn|  =  1 / n2d - 1. Hence, by Rouché's theorem, the polynomial rd,n(x) has two roots v satisfying |v - xn| < 1 / nd - 1. Using a complex version of Taylor's theorem, by writing the roots v of rd,n(x) close to xn as v = xn  +  β  +  γi with γ  >  0, we get

[formula]

Note that we have

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

By considering imaginary parts in the above Taylor's formula we get

[formula]

Since the distance between the roots xn  +  β  +  γi and xn  +  β  -  γi of rd,n(x) is equal to 2γ and H(rd,n) = O(n2), it follows from Mahler's theorem [\cite=Mah64] quoted in the introduction that γ  ≫  1 / n2d - 2. Thus, β  =  O(1 / nd - 1). Moreover, β  =  O(1 / nd), unless γ  ≪  1 / n2d - 3. Looking at real parts leads to

[formula]

The assumption that γ  ≪  1 / n2d - 3 leads to a contradiction, by considering (7) as a quadratic equation in β. Hence, we have β  =  O(1 / nd). Now (7) gives γ2  =  1 / n2d - 1  +  O(1 / n2d), i.e., γ  =  1 / n(2d - 1) / 2  +  O(1 / nd), as claimed in (6). Let Rd,n(x) be the irreducible factor of rd,n(x) having roots vd,n and [formula]. Denote by δ its degree. Note that, since H(rd,n) = O(n2), Gelfond's inequality implies that

[formula]

Denote by Resd,n the resultant of the polynomials Rd,n(x) and Ln(x). Since Resd,n is a rational integer and xn is not a root of Rd,n(x), we have

[formula]

Furthermore, the definition of the resultant of two polynomials (see e.g. [\cite=BuLiv]) implies that (recall that Rd,n(x) is monic)

[formula]

Since the product of the absolute values of all the roots of Rd,n(x) different from vd,n and [formula] is bounded from above by [formula] times the height of Rd,n(x) (see [\cite=BuLiv]), we deduce from (6) and (8) that

[formula]

Combined with (9), this gives 2δ  ≥  2d  -  3, thus

[formula]

This implies that either rd,n(x) is irreducible, or it has an integer root (recall that any rational root of a monic polynomial must be a rational integer).

Assume that rd,n(x) is reducible, i.e., that it has an integer root. This integer must divide rd,n(0) = F2⌊(d - 1) / 2⌋, and, by (5), it is of the form -  α2 for an integer α dividing F⌊(d - 1) / 2⌋. So, for any given degree d, there are only finitely many possibilities for the integer root of rd,n(x).

Write rd,n(x) as

[formula]

By the definition of rd,n(x) and (1), it follows easily by induction that the discriminant Bd(x)2  -  4Ad(x)Cd(x) of rd,n(x) with respect to n is equal to - 4F4⌊(d - 1) / 2⌋x2d - 1. In particular, this discriminant is nonzero at x =  - α2, and thus at least one of the numbers Ad( - α2), Bd( - α2), Cd( - α2) is nonzero. This shows that rd,n(x) is irreducible over [formula].

Furthermore, for given α there are exactly two (rational) values of n such that -  α2 is a root of rd,n(x). Hence, for sufficiently large positive integer n, the polynomial rd,n(x) has no integer roots, and therefore it is irreducible over [formula].

Since

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

which proves Theorem [\ref=tm3].

Clusters of roots

Let d  ≥  2 be an integer. Mahler's upper bound e(d)  ≤  d - 1 quoted in the Introduction is a particular case of the lower bound

[formula]

valid for any integer polynomial P(x) of degree d having at least k  ≥  2 distinct roots [formula], established in [\cite=Mah64].

In [\cite=BM2] the authors extended the definition of e(d) to clusters of at least 3 roots. Let k and d be integers with 2  ≤  k  ≤  d. We denote by E(d,k), respectively Eirr(d,k), the infimum of the real numbers δ for which

[formula]

holds for every integer polynomial P(x), respectively, irreducible integer polynomial P(x), of degree d and sufficiently large height, with distinct roots [formula]. We further use the notation E*(d,k), respectively E*irr(d,k), when we restrict our attention to monic integer polynomials, respectively monic integer irreducible polynomials.

We deduce from (10) that the quantities E(d,k) and E*(d,k) are all bounded from above by d - 1. Regarding lower bounds, it is proved in [\cite=BM1] [\cite=BM2] that, for any integer d  ≥  4 and any integer k  ≥  2 that divides d, we have

[formula]

In fact, the results from [\cite=BM1] [\cite=BM2] show that these bounds are valid also for Eirr(d,k) and E*irr(d,k), respectively. The constructions presented in the Sections 2 and 3 allow us to strengthen the estimates (11).

For every integer k  ≥  3, there exist rational numbers c1(k) and c2(k) such that, for every integer d  ≥  k, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

In particular, the exponent - d + 1 in (10) cannot be replaced by -  αkd, for a real number αk less than k / (k + 1), even if the polynomial P(x) in (10) is assumed to be monic.

Proof. Let δ  ≥  2 and h  ≥  0 be integers. The polynomial

[formula]

has degree (h + 2)δ  +  h(h + 1) / 2, height ≪  nh + 4, and it has a cluster of h + 3 roots close to each other. Setting k  =  h + 3, a short calculation gives (12), since one can multiply P̃δ,h,n(x) by a suitable power of the monomial x. To get (13), it suffices, for δ even, to consider the polynomial

[formula]

multiplied by a suitable power of the monomial x. We omit the details.
