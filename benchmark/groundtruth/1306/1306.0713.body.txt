Effect of charge doping on the electronic structure, orbital polarization, and structural distortion in nickelate superlattice

Introduction

Recent technical advances in the atomic-scale growth of transition metal oxide (TMO) heterostructures have created considerable research interest [\cite=MRS] [\cite=Hwang_review]. In TMO heterostructures, multiple degrees of freedom (i.e., charge, spin, orbital, lattice) are coupled to each other, often creating novel material characteristics such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magneto resistence [\cite=MIT-RMP]. Using atomic-scale techniques to fabricate artificial TMO heterostructures makes it possible to control those degrees of freedom and band structures, and therefore to create or design new 'correlated electron' properties. Previous TMO superlattice studies [\cite=Ohtomo-1] [\cite=Okamoto] [\cite=Ohtomo-2] [\cite=Nakagawa] [\cite=OrbReconst] have shown that many unexpected material phenomena can be realized at the TMO heterointerface, such as magnetism and superconductivity [\cite=mag-2007] [\cite=mag-LAOSTO-1] [\cite=mag-LAOSTO-2] [\cite=Reyren] [\cite=Gibert].

When combined with other degrees of freedom, charge doping can play a significant role in determining material properties of TMO heterostructures. Sometimes extra charges are introduced in an unexpected and uncontrolled way. For example, oxygen vacancies often drives a TMO system to exhibit fairly different material characteristics (e.g., driving an insulating material to be metallic) [\cite=O-vac1] [\cite=O-vac2] [\cite=O-vac3]. Cation inter-mixing can also be important, as it introduces a different local ionic potential to the nearby atoms (e.g., the inter-mixing of Sr2 + and La3 +). It is also possible to control the amount of extra charges by chemical doping or electric field, for example. Considering all these possibilities, it is important to understand the effect of charge doping in TMO heterostructures. In particular, the relation between the rotation of metal-oxygen octahedra and charge doping has never been investigated in a systematic way.

Among the various TMOs, rare-earth nickelate compounds RNiO3, where R denotes rare-earth elements, show interesting properties. The RNiO3 series exhibit a range of transitions, from the "correlated metal" phase of LaNiO3 to charge-ordered insulating states as the ionic R becomes smaller and more octahedral distortion is introduced[\cite=RNO_review]. In such systems, the systematic dependence of the transition temperature TMI with respect to the ionic size of R implies strong coupling between the structural and electronic degrees of freedom. In this regard, introducing reduced dimensionality through the synthesis of nickelate compound heterostructures can be another promising way to control the material properties and realize emergent physics in this system[\cite=Chaloupka] [\cite=Hansmann] [\cite=LNOLAO-NatMatt]. Indeed, it has recently been reported that LaNiO3, which is a paramagnetic metal in the bulk phase, shows insulating behavior with magnetic order in a superlattice[\cite=Boris-Science] [\cite=Frano]. There have been a number of subsequent studies about nickelate heterostructures[\cite=Kaiser-PRL] [\cite=Chakhalian] [\cite=May] [\cite=NNO-PRL] [\cite=Stemmer-new] [\cite=Frano] [\cite=Pentcheva] [\cite=SIC] [\cite=MJHan-DMFT] [\cite=MJHan-opol] [\cite=MJHan-LDAU] [\cite=MJHan-LNOSTO], which show a potential for rich physics, but there has not been systematic studies about the effect of doping in these systems yet.

In this paper, we examine the effect of doping on the nickelate superlattice by taking (LaNiO3)1/(SrTiO3)1 as a prototype example [\cite=Kaiser-PRL] [\cite=Son] [\cite=Stemmer-new] [\cite=MJHan-LNOSTO]. We employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations augmented with mean-field treatment of on-site Coulomb interaction, the so-called DFT+U methodology, to consider the role of electron correlations inherent in the Ni eg orbitals. The behavior of the electronic structure, orbital polarization, magnetism, and structural distortion with respect to the amount of charge doping is examined, and the effect of Coulomb interaction is also discussed. We pay our special attention to the orbital order within the Ni eg states and the structural responses to it. Two different structural settings have been considered: (i) the calculations in which only tetragonal distortions of NiO6 octahedra (elongation or contration of Ni-O bond length along the normal direction to the superlattice plane) are allowed and (ii) the full NiO6 octahedral distorion including rotation and Jahn-Teller distortion. In the first set, we investigate how the doping-induced change of orbital polarization affects the NiO6 octahedra. The relation between the octahedral rotation pattern and the local distortion is examined with the second sets. Hereafter we call the first and the second sets as the 'tetragonally-distorted' and 'fully-distorted' cells, respectively. Systematic changes are found: As electrons are introduced, the orbital polarization (i.e., the relative occupation of dx2 - y2 to d3z2 - r2) is reduced, and the Ni to apical oxygen distance is enhanced. The evolution of the octahedral rotation angles also exhibits a systematic tendency on charge doping. Our results suggest a possibility to control the structural property as well as the electronic structure by doping, and provides useful information to understand the experiments under the various types of doping situations.

After presenting the computational details in Sec. [\ref=sec2], we present and discuss the calculated phase diagrams in Sec. [\ref=sec-PD]. We further elaborate our results of the tetragonally (Sec. [\ref=sec3]) and fully distorted (Sec.[\ref=sec4]) calculations in the following sections. In consideration of recent theoretical and experimental results on the relevant systems, we discuss the implications and limitations of our results. Further issues are discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec5], and we summarize our results in Sec. [\ref=sec6].

Computation Details

For the electronic structure calculations, we used DFT within local spin density approximation (LSDA)[\cite=CA] and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method [\cite=PAW] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package [\cite=VASP]. We adopted a plane-wave energy cutoff of 400 eV with a 6  ×  6  ×  4 k-point sampling on the Monkhorst-Pack grid. To incorporate the effect of electron correlations within the Ni d orbital, the so-called simplified version of rotationally invariant DFT+U as suggested by Dudarev et al. [\cite=Dudarev] was used with the effective [formula] varying from 0 to 5 eV. In the previous literature, the relatively small value of U  ~  3 eV has been taken as a reasonable value [\cite=Chakhalian] [\cite=Gibert] [\cite=ATLee] for a nickelate superlattice although it can be regarded as too small. Since the value of Ueff can be an important issue, we scanned the range of Ueff and discuss its effect on the electronic and magnetic structure. For each doping and Ueff value, the structural optimization was performed with a force criterion of 1 meV/Å . During this process, a ferromagnetic (FM) and a checkerboard-type antiferromagnetic (AF) order were set as the initial magnetic configurations.

Fig. [\ref=fig:struct] shows the unit cell structure of the (LaNiO3)1/(SrTiO3)1 superlattice used in this study. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:struct](a) and (b), we chose a [formula] supercell with La-Sr intersite mixing to avoid the internal electric fields. For the in-plane lattice constant we used 3.905[formula] Å, corresponding to the SrTiO3 value. The out-of-plane lattice constant is optimized for each doping level and Ueff value. For a subset of doping and Ueff values (Ueff = 0, 3, and 5 eV; ±  0.5 and 0 electrons per Ni) we performed the 2  ×  2 supercell calculations (four Ni atoms per unit cell) and obtained consistent results with the [formula] unit cell.

To investigate the influence of charge doping we mainly used the rigid band shift method, in which the doped charges are compensated by the uniform background of the opposite sign. Seven different charge dopings have been considered: ±  0.50, ±  0.25, ±  0.125, and 0.00 electrons per Ni atom (hereafter denoted as ±  0.50e, ±  0.25e, ±  0.125e, and the undoped cell, respectively). A different type of doping was also considered by changing the Sr/La ratio. Since our unit cells contain four A-site cations, ±  0.50e of doping can be simulated with the case of (La0.5NiO3)1/(Sr1.5TiO3)1, and (La1.5NiO3)1/(Sr0.5TiO3)1 as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:struct](c) and (d) respectively. These two will be hearafter denoted as LaSr3- and La3Sr-cell, respectively.

The orbital polarization, representing the relative occupations in the two Ni-eg orbitals, can be defined as[\cite=MJHan-opol]:

[formula]

where we choose εb  =   - 3.5 eV (with the Fermi energy εF  =  0) to capture the occupations on the valence d-orbital-like states. We found that our conclusions were unchanged even when we used the values of εb down to - 10 eV.

Overall phase diagram

Let us first take an overall view of our results in the parameter space spanned by charge doping and Ueff. Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](a) and (b) show the results from the tetragonally and fully distorted calculations, respectively. The shape and the color of the symbols denote the type of the magnetic order and the orbital polarization, respectively. Comparing Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](a) to (b), one can notice the following points. i) Due to the confinement effect, dx2 - y2 is preferred over the d3z2 - r2 orbital in the majority region of the parameter space, while in the electron-doped and the large Ueff regions, the d3z2 - r2 orbital is favored and Peg becomes negative. The area of the negative Peg region is significantly enlarged as the NiO6 octahedra distortion is fully allowed (Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](b)), which is indicative of the cooperation between the orbital and the structural degrees of freedom in these compounds. ii) In the small-Ueff ([formula] 2 eV) regime the paramagnetic or weak ferromagnetic metal phase is stable, while the 'half-metallic' ferromagnetic phase with gapless majority and gapped minority spin channel is stabilized when Ueff is large ([formula] 4 eV). The preference for the ferromagnetic phase is consistent with a previous DFT+U study in these regimes [\cite=Pentcheva] [\cite=May] [\cite=MJHan-LDAU], although these results are not well compared with the recent experimental observations that report the insulating phase with no magnetization in ultrathin LaNiO3 heterostructures[\cite=Boris-Science] [\cite=Frano]. iii) In between the weak and strong Ueff regime (Ueff≃ 3 eV), the metallic phase with antiferromagnetic order (ferrimagnetic order in the fully distorted calculations) is preferred over the ferromagnetic states. The antiferromagnetic phases in the tetrogonally distorted cells were not captured by the previous DFT+U study, in which sparse sets of Ueff values were used[\cite=Pentcheva] [\cite=MJHan-LDAU]. The antiferromagnetic phase turns into ferrimagnetic phases in the fully distorted calculations. This type of spin order was also not observed in previous studies since these phases become favorable only in the narrow area in the parameter space as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](b) [\cite=Pentcheva] [\cite=May]. Since it is argued that DFT+U is inconsistent with experiments in terms of FM spin ground state[\cite=SIC] it is important to note this point. iv) In the fully distorted cells, a strong Jahn-Teller distortion exists near the undoped regime with Ueff larger than 4 eV. On the other hand, the NiO6 breathing mode having two inequivalent Ni sites, reported in other DFT+U studies [\cite=Pentcheva] [\cite=Chakhalian], was not observed in our undoped cells partly due to the difference in the cation ordering. Instead, we found the breathing mode in the electron-doped regime with Ueff larger than 2 eV.

Results with tetragonal distortion

In this section we present the calculation results of the tetragonally distorted cells. The results are meaningful for understanding the system in further details and may be relevant to experimental situations in which the rotational distortion modes are suppressed for some reason, although a recent study of LNO/STO indicates the possible rotations [\cite=Stemmer-new]. For simplicity, we focus on the shaded regions of the phase diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](a).

Structural changes

The most significant structural parameter changed by doping is the Ni to apical oxygen distance (dNi - Oap). Figure [\ref=fig:atomdisp] shows the ratio between dNi - Oap and the Ni to planar oxygen distance (dNi - Opl), which is fixed in the tetragonally distorted cells. Increasing trends with respect to electron doping is clearly seen. The result of the LaSr3/La3Sr-cell calculations (empty symbols) is consistent with the rigid band shift calculations (filled symbols).

In most cases, the dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl is below the unity due to the tensile strain. Increasing Ueff, however, enhances dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl in the electron-doped regime, as can be seen in the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:atomdisp]. The abrupt change of dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl can likely be attributted to the Ueff-dependence of dx2 - y2/d3z2 - r2-orbital occupations which will be discussed further in the following subsection.

Electronic structure, orbital polarization, and magnetism

The doped charges reside mostly in the Ni eg bands, since the Ti-t2g states are well separated from the Fermi level and the Ni-t2g are fully filled, in all configurations except the tetragonally distorted cells with Ueff  =   0 eV. In the case of La3Sr- or the LaSr3-cells, a small fraction of Ti-t2g bands touches the Fermi level at Ueff=0, and they are pushed away from the Fermi level as Ueff is included. We also note that all of the results remain metallic regardless of the value of Ueff, doping, and the presence of octahedral rotation or distortion.

From the shape of Ni eg-projected density of states (PDOS), schematically shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:orbitpol](a), it is expected that the major portion of the doped charges fill up the d3z2 - r2 orbitals and Peg changes accordingly (See Fig. [\ref=figA:pdos_d] and [\ref=figA:pdos_eg] in the Appendix for the full details of PDOS). Fig. [\ref=fig:orbitpol](b) shows that while the orbital polarization decreases as the more electrons are doped over the entire range of Ueff, the detailed behavior is different, and depends on the Ueff value. In the region of Ueff  ≤   3 eV, the Peg decreases gradually as electrons are doped. For Ueff  ≥   5 eV, Peg is reduced significantly and changes sign when more than +0.25e of electons per Ni are doped. The results of Ueff  =   4 eV is in between the two, and exhibits the behaviors of both regimes. These features are consistent with the behavior of dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl under electron doping; more occupations in d3z2 - r2 (i.e., the smaller Peg) should favor longer dNi - Oap owing to the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons occupying the Ni d3z2 - r2 orbital and the pz orbital in the apical oxygen. Accordingly, NiO6 octahedra are elongated along the interface-normal direction as electrons are introduced. Note that the La3Sr- or the LaSr3-cell calculations (open symbols in Fig. [\ref=fig:orbitpol](b)) shows results consistent with the rigid band shift calculations.

Figure [\ref=fig:mag](a) shows the size of the Ni magnetic moment as a function of doping at Ueff  =   0, 3, and 5 eV. When Ueff is less than 3 eV, the hole doping induces ferromagnetic moments. The schematic shape of PDOS suggests that, in this range of Ueff, the Stoner mechanism may be responsible for it in hole-doped systems. On the other hands, the antiferromagnetic phase is stabilized in 3  ≤  Ueff  ≤  4.5 eV (see Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](a)). In between the ferro- and the antiferromagnetic phases, a ferrimagnetic order is induced in the electron doped regime at Ueff  =   3 eV. The relative energy between the converged ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases at Ueff  =   4 eV, as well as the size of the moments, are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:mag](b). One can notice two crossovers as the system evolves from the hole-doped to the electron-doped regime; the crossover from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic phase around -  0.25e doping, and from the antiferromagnetic to a half-metallic phase after +0.25e doping. The half-metallic phase, which exibits a small value of Peg as depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:orbitpol](b), extends to the entire range of doping above Ueff  =   5 eV.

The type of magnetism and the size of orbital polarization shows an interesting relation. The weakly correlated ferromangetic and the antiferromagnetic phase exibit a larger value of Peg, while the half-metallic phase favors a small and even negative Peg. The situation is schematically depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:mag](c); In the weakly correlated ferromagnetic phase the confinement effect favors the dx2 - y2 orbital rather than d3z2 - r2, and at Ueff  =   4 eV the orbital polarization increases and antiferromangetic phase originating from the dx2 - y2-like states occurs. Such tendency can be seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:orbitpol](b), where Peg is enhanced as Ueff becomes larger up to 4 eV near the undoped regime. On the contrary, as Ueff goes beyond that (Ueff=5 eV), driving the system half-metallic becomes more favorable owing to the large Ni eg bandwidth, and the Peg drops significantly. One can speculate that, up to a moderate strength, Ueff tries to lower the energy by enhancing the orbital polarization and driving the system antiferromagnetic. Beyond that, a half-metallic system with less orbital polarization is energetically favorable (see Fig. [\ref=fig:mag](c)).

It should be noted that the origin of the spurious half-metallic ferromagnetic phase is the energy shift of the Ni eg bands induced by electron correlations, which was the only way that DFT+U methodology could reduce the Coulomb energy in this system as depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:mag](c). More elaborate treatment of electron correlations, however, can take the bandwidth renormalization effect into account[\cite=HPark] [\cite=MJ-GW], which can facilitate the orbital ordering scenario (compare the center and right figures of Fig. [\ref=fig:mag](c)). Also, although the presence of a half-metallic ferromagnetic phase seems robust in the strong Ueff regime, it suffers from a large amount of ferromagnetic moments which is inconsistent with experimental observations of no net magnetic moments in nickelate superlattices[\cite=Boris-Science] [\cite=Frano]. In this regard, we speculate that the half-metallic ferromagnetic phase can be considered as an artifact of an inappropriately large value of Ueff for Ni eg orbital in the DFT+U formalism.

Results with octahedral rotation

In this section, the full octahedral distortions are taken into account in combination with the effect of doping. As a starting configuration for the structural optimization, we considered four different cases of (a0a0c-)-, (a-a-c0)-, and (a-a-c±)-type rotations (following the Glazer notation as defined in Ref. [\cite=Glazer] [\cite=May] [\cite=Rondinelli-Spaldin-2], where the positive and negative signs refer to the ferro- and antiferro-distortive rotation, respectively) and performed the structure relaxations with the symmetry enforced. The structures obtained by this process were further optimized with the symmetry constraint turned off. Without the constraint, the oxygen cage shape can deviate from the ideal one. Therefore, we present the averaged values of the bond lengths and the rotation angles. Also, with the removal of the structural constraints, the Jahn-Teller- or breathing type distortion of NiO6 octahedra is obtained in some cases. For simplicity, we focus on the shaded regions of the phase diagram in Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](a).

Structural changes

The evolution of the Ni-O bond length ratio dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl in the fully distorted calculations are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_local](a) as a function of doping. An increasing trend of dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl is obtained, which is mainly attributed to the enlarged dNi - Oap. Even in the presence of the octahedral rotation the dNi - Opl is not significantly changed unless any additional distortion is introduced (as will be discussed further below). Due to the breathing-type distortion of the two inequivalent NiO6 octahedra, the ratio of dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl is branched into two parts in the electron-doped regime at Ueff  =  3 and 5 eV. The dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl is significantly larger than the values for the tetragonally distorted case in Fig. [\ref=fig:atomdisp], because the octahedral rotation creates more room for the bond length elongation. This observation indicates the stronger preference to d3z2 - r2 orbital occupation (negative Peg) in the electron-doped regime, compared to the case of the tetragonally distorted cells. Due to the released symmetry constraint, the doped electrons can preferentially occupy the Ni(1) sites and reduce the energy cost. The smaller dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl for Ni(1) (or increased dNi - Opl) indicates that additional electrons occupy the dx2 - y2 orbital. The Jahn-Teller type NiO6 octahedral distortion is observed in the undoped regime Ueff  ≤   4 eV. This type of distortion has not been reported in previous first-principles calculation studies in which the smaller value of Ueff  ≈   3 eV was used [\cite=Chakhalian] [\cite=Pentcheva]. Since the Ni-eg orbital is mainly occupied by one electron in the undoped regime, the Jahn-Teller distortion can be a plausible way to lower the electron correlation energy when Ueff is strong, while it has not been reported in experimental studies[\cite=Tung]. The degree of Jahn-Teller distortion at Ueff  =   5 eV is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_local](d) as a function of doping.

The rotation of NiO6 and TiO6 octahedra also exhibits an interesting pattern in response to the charge doping. Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_ang] shows the calculated NiO6 rotation angles as a function of electron doping. At Ueff  =   0 eV, the antiferro-distortive angle γ (see the inset of Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_ang](a)) is gradually increased from [formula] to [formula], while the angle α and β are decreased from [formula] to [formula]. Interestingly, this behavior is similar to the structural change caused by biaxial compressive strain in LaAlO3, in which the lattice constant change is attributed solely to the strain (without doping) while the size of the AlO6 octahedra remains basically unchanged[\cite=Hatt]. In our system, the dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl ratio increases as electrons are doped to the system, so the system should feel an 'effective' decrease of the c-axis constant, or equivalently, the biaxial tensile strain if the c-axis constant had been fixed. Instead, the c-axis lattice constant is increased under the electron doping, enough to overcompensate the elongation of the NiO6 octahedral. So the system feels an effective in-plane compressive strain and the angle γ increases slightly while α and β reduce. Another point to mention is that the rotation angle of the LaSr3- and La3Sr-cell show the same (a-b0c0) type pattern, which might be due to the arrangement of La3 + and Sr2 + cations and the resulting internal electric field along the c-direction. Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_ang](b) presents the results for Ueff  =   3 eV. In the hole-doped and undoped regime the results are similar with those at Ueff  =   0 eV, except for the case of -  0.25e doping where (a-b0c0)-like rotation is stabilized. In the electron-doped regime, on the other hand, the system changes from the ferrimagnetic to the half-metallic phase and the rotation pattern also changes drastically to an (a-a-c+)-like phase as the electron doping increases to +0.50e/Ni. Such behavior is also observed in the electron-doped regime at Ueff  =   5 eV, indicating that the large dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl ratio as well as the presence of the breathing distortion might result in the significant change of the rotation angle in these regimes. The rotation pattern in the undoped and weakly hole-doped regime at Ueff  =   5 eV is similar to those at Ueff  =   0 and 3 eV, but with enhanced (a-a-c0)-like character. The La3Sr-cell calculation gives the qualitatively same rotation pattern with the +0.50e-cells at Ueff  =   3 and 5 eV, since the rotation angle is large enough to overcome the effect of local ionic configurations in this regime.

Electronic structure, orbital polarization, and magnetism

The calculated Peg as a function of doping in the fully distorted calculations is summarized in Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_magnother](a), in which the decreasing tendency is clearly observed. While this feature is similar to that in Sec. [\ref=sec3], the graph branches into two in the electron-doped regime for Ueff  =   3 and 5 eV. In addition, Peg becomes smaller in the entire doping range because the released structural constraint allows dNi - Oap to be increased by adopting octahedral rotation and tilting. The d3z2 - r2 orbital occupation is favored accordingly. The calculated PDOS provides additional information about the behavior of the doped charge; as more electrons are introduced, an empty peak of Ni(2) dx2 - y2 character emerges above the Fermi level while the two eg orbitals of Ni(1) are equally occupied (see Appendix, Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_eg]). This feature can also be seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_local] where dNi - Oap  /  dNi - Opl of Ni(1) reaches to unity in the electron-doped regime due to the equal occupation of dx2 - y2 and d3z2 - r2 orbitals (i.e. the vanishing Peg of Ni(1) in the electron-doped regime at Ueff  =   5 eV, see Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_magnother].(a)).

The behavior of the Ni magnetic moment is also similar to that in the tetragonally distorted cases (Fig. [\ref=fig:mag](a)) for Ueff  =   0 and 3 eV. However in this case, the half-metallic phase is obtained in the calculation of +0.50e-cell with Ueff  =   3 eV. The antiferromagnetic phase disappears as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:PD](b) due to the reduction of Peg in the fully distorted cells. The reduction of Peg also enlarges the area of the half-metallic phase in Ueff  ≥   4 eV. In the electron-doped regime of the half-metallic phase, the magnetic moments on the two inequivalent Ni atoms reflect the charge disproportionation on the Ni sites.

Discussion

The doping simulated by the rigid band shift cannot be the same as what happens in real experimental situations, such an oxygen vacancies. For example, oxygen vacancies not only introduces effective electron doping, but also distorts the local structure by disconnecting the metal-oxygen-metal network. However, we note that the two different approaches, which incorporate the charge doping in our calculations, produce consistent results regarding the change of the electronic structure, orbital polarization and structural property. Also, the orbital polarization is insensitive to some degrees of structural difference. These findings strongly suggest that the overall conclusions presented in this study are quite relevant to various doping situations in experiments, in spite of the limitation of the simulation methods.

We emphasize that our results can provide useful information for understanding texperiments. For example, the further distortion of rotated oxygen octahedra caused by doping implies that additional oxygen vacancies do not necessarily lead the system to be more metallic, because further rotation can simultaneously make the system be less metallic due to the enlarged effective U / t parameter. Also, our prediction of polarization dependence as a function of electron doping can be tested in experiments, for example by changing the oxygen partial pressure in the pulsed laser deposition process. Similar doping-induced structural changes may happen in other oxide superlattices with d-orbital degrees of freedom, such as the LaTiO3/LaAlO3 system. One may also speculate the possibility of rich phases from the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 superlattices, where the two independent orbital degrees of freedom from the Ti-t2g and Ni-eg can interact through corner-sharing coupling of the NiO6 and TiO6 octahedra. Such materials as well as other relevant systems may have substantial importance and deserve further theoretical investigation.

Summary

The effect of charge doping on the electronic, orbital and structural properties in LaNiO3/SrTiO3 has been investigated using first-principles density functional theory calculation, in which doping was simulated with two different methods, namely, rigid band shift and the cation-substituted calculation. The results clearly show the systematic dependence of these physical properties on doping. As more electrons are introduced, the orbital polarization is reduced and the Ni to apical oxygen distance significantly increases. These features are found in both tetragonally distorted and the fully distorted results. Remarkably, the rotation angles of the NiO6/TiO6 octahedra are also found to strongly depend on doping. Our results suggest a possible way to control orbital and structural property by means of charge doping, and provide useful information to understand the experimental results under various doping situations, such as oxygen vacancies.

Projected density of states (PDOS)

In this Appendix, we present the electronic structure change as a function of doping, which provides further information for understanding the doping dependence of our system, which is closely related to the other physical quantities discussed above.

Figure [\ref=figA:pdos_d] and [\ref=figA:pdos_eg] shows the PDOS in the tetragonally distorted cells. First of all, we note that the electronic structure difference between rigid band shift and LaSr3/La3Sr-cell calculation is not significant. This point also holds for the results of the fully distorted cells, as shown in Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_d] and Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_eg]. It is therefore consistent with our finding that two different approaches predict the same features regarding the orbital occupation and structural properties as discussed above. The overall shape of the Ni-eg PDOS in the weakly correlated regime is actually consistent with the schematic picture in Fig. [\ref=fig:atomdisp](a), vindicating our discussion in Sec. [\ref=sec3].B based on this picture.

Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_d] and [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_eg] show the PDOS from the structures with octahedral rotations in which the Jahn-Teller or breathing type distortion is incorporated (main results discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec4]). Compared to the rotation-free results, due to the rotations, additional splittings are introduced in the Ni-eg states as clearly shown in Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_eg]. Also, in the presence of Ueff, electron doping induces charge disproportionation (see the fourth and fifth rows of Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_eg](b)-(e)). From the PDOS results and the data in Fig. [\ref=fig:rot_magnother], one can consider that Ni(1) and Ni(2) (Fig. [\ref=figA:rot_pdos_eg](b), (d) and (c), (e)) behave like as the d8- and d7-configuration in the electron-doped regime, respectively.
