Discriminating quantum field theories in curved spacetime

-Introduction. The Unruh effect [\cite=Unruh1976] as it is often understood is the prediction that accelerated bodies in empty space experience a temperature proportional to their acceleration. Despite several experimental proposals being put forth [\cite=ExpProp], verification of the Unruh effect remains an open research program. In particular, several experiments are currently underway [\cite=Retzker2008] to test analogues of this effect in more accessible regimes.

The thermal appearance of the vacuum isn't the only effect of passing from inertial to non-inertial coordinates. More broadly, the field state is acted on by a linear quantum channel which takes every state in the inertial frame to a corresponding state in the accelerated frame [\cite=Birrell1982]. This opens up the possibility of testing quantum field theory in curved spacetimes using states other than the vacuum.

While nearly all modern research discussions of uniformly accelerated motion adopt the Unruh theory [\cite=Doukas2012] [\cite=Downes2013] [\cite=Bruschi2010] [\cite=Alsing2003] [\cite=Doukas2009] [\cite=Dragan2012] [\cite=Crispino], a lesser known alternative theory has been suggested [\cite=Narozhny], see also [\cite=Comment]. The authors argue the Hamiltonian in the Unruh theory does not correspond to that of a free field in Minkowski space but rather to one satisfying an additional boundary condition. Instead they propose quantizing the field in the accelerated frame with respect to the eigenmodes of the Boost operator. This leads to a non-inertial vacuum that is equivalent to the inertial one, and therefore makes the distinctly different prediction that there is no universally thermal behavior in the accelerated frame. We consider this theory here as an alternative against which the Unruh effect can be tested; one way of obtaining evidence in favor of a physical theory is by observing that it prevails over alternatives. Quantum state discrimination has been developed to perform quantum statistical hypothesis testing [\cite=QSD]. For a given input state, the problem of quantum state discrimination is equivalent to quantum channel discrimination: Alice sends a known state to Bob down one of two channels. Bob's task is to identify which of the two channels acted on the received state. The probability of Bob misidentifying the channel can be minimized provided that he performs optimal measurements. By varying the input state one can search for an optimal strategy, i.e., the initial state and measurement observables which minimize the probability of misidentification.

This approach was used for the purpose of detecting lossy channels [\cite=invernizzi], improving target detection [\cite=Tan2008] and boosting the readout of digital memories [\cite=Pirandola2011]. Here we show, using the Unruh theory as a specific example, that quantum channel discrimination can also be applied to test physical theories. Since the Unruh theory and the alternative theory can be thought of as two different quantum channels, deciding which theory is correct then maps to the problem of discriminating which of these two channels operate when changing from an inertial to an accelerated frame. Our objective is to determine which initial states should be sent down this unidentified channel and which observables should be measured such that the actual channel can most clearly be revealed.

Ordinarily one attempts to verify the Unruh effect by measuring particles in the vacuum from an accelerated frame. The detection of any number of particles would be evidence in its favor. However, such a test is not perfect. Even excluding the possibility of dark counts, a thermal state is not orthogonal to the vacuum state. Therefore in such experiments there is always some probability of making an error. The question then is, do other strategies exist which reduce these identification errors?

In this letter we answer this question in the affirmative and report on feasible strategies that can be used to discriminate the Unruh theory that outperform this simple vacuum particle counting approach. These results are expected to be useful in tests of the Unruh theory in analogue experiments that are due to come online in the near future. This provides a proof of principle that these tools can also be used, for example, in testing of Hawking radiation in analogue systems [\cite=Analogue] and other such tests of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.

-Two quantum channels of non-inertial motion. Our analysis is presented for a real massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions (c = 1), but it can be generalized to any specific experimental setup. We consider an inertial source that emits radiation that is incident on an accelerating particle detector. Particular frequencies can be selected by the detector by placing in front a tunable linear filter, such as a Fabry-Perot interferometer, or by "homodyning" with a specific local oscillator mode [\cite=Downes2013]. Since the detector is accelerated, the frequencies selected are defined with respect to the proper time (Rindler time). Two hypotheses are considered arising from different definitions of the modes corresponding to such frequencies: H1 (The Unruh theory): The normal modes are hypothesized to be Rindler modes, with support on x > |t|. They are superpositions of positive and negative frequency Minkowski plane-waves. Particles in these modes, first discussed by Fulling [\cite=Fulling1972], are called Rindler-Fulling particles. We denote the Rindler detection mode by ψ1. H0 (The alternative theory): The normal modes are hypothesized to be eigenvectors of the Boost operator, [formula] [\cite=Narozhny], a.k.a, "Unruh modes". They are superpositions of positive frequency Minkowski plane-waves and are supported everywhere. We denote the Unruh detection mode by ψ0.

The H0 channel, E0, is simply a change of basis into Unruh modes described by a passive Bogoliubov transformation, see for example [\cite=Bruschi2010], followed by a trace over all modes orthogonal to ψ0. The H1 channel, E1, can be decomposed into an E0 map followed by a Bosonic amplification channel, [formula] [\cite=Aspachs], which brings the state into the Rindler mode basis, i.e., [formula].

In principle the experimentalist is at liberty to tailor the mode transmitted by the source to suit the experimental purpose. Simplification occurs when the source mode is an Unruh mode, i.e., [formula]. The Unruh effect can then be tested by discriminating between an amplification channel and a trivial channel. However it is currently unknown how to engineer a Hamiltonian that produces such modes. To make closer connection to settings that are likely to be experimentally feasible, we also consider source modes that are peaked in ordinary Minkowski frequencies by taking narrow spectrally-uniform wave-packets [\cite=Hawking1975] [\cite=Takagi]. In this case, the [formula] channel is no longer trivial.

-Quantum channel discrimination. We trial several different input states, ρ, and assume that M identical copies of each of them are available for collective measurement. Quantum state discrimination is then performed on the two output states E0(ρ) and E1(ρ) corresponding to each of the hypotheses. A two-outcome positive operator valued measurement with operators E0 and E1, satisfying E0  +  E1 = 1 and [formula], is used to discriminate between H0 and H1 respectively. The probability of misidentification of a given strategy is [formula], where [formula] is the Helstrom matrix, and the a priori probabilities for each of the hypotheses have been assumed to be equal to one-half. Optimizing over all positive operator valued measurements one obtains the Helstrom bound:

[formula]

When the initial state is the vacuum, so too is the H0 state, E0(ρ) = |0〉〈0|. On the other hand, the H1 state is a thermal state with mean particle number n, where n is equal to the average number of particles in the detection mode (i.e., the Unruh thermal state):

[formula]

Since the Helstrom matrix is diagonal and only the first eigenvalue is negative, we immediately deduce that the optimal measurement is E0 = |0〉〈0| and [formula], which is simply a test of the existence of particles. In this strategy the probability of misidentification is:

[formula]

One recognizes this as the strategy to observe the Unruh effect described in the introduction. Our objective is to find alternative strategies that reduce this probability of error thereby enhancing discrimination of the theories.

It is not always possible to calculate the Helstrom bound exactly. A more readily computable upper bound is the Quantum Chernoff Bound (QCB), [formula], [\cite=Pirandola2008] [\cite=Audenaert2007]:

[formula]

where M is the number of independent copies of the state and [formula] is the quantum Chernoff information giving the exponent for which the probability of misidentification most quickly decreases with increasing M. In practice multiple independent copies of the state would be used to discriminate the theories. In the limit that M  →    ∞   the inequality in ([\ref=helQCBbound]) becomes tight. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit finding the state which minimizes the QCB is equivalent to optimizing the strategy. Since minimization of the QCB over the single copy state implies minimization over the multiple copy state [\cite=invernizzi] (constrained by mean energy per copy), we only need to perform the analysis of the single copy state. It should be clear that by optimal state we mean the state which minimizes the QCB and therefore provides the minimum error probability in the asymptotic limit of many copies. For calculating the QCB we use the tools and conventions of [\cite=Pirandola2008] [\cite=Weedbrook2012]. -Single mode displaced vacuum states. We first consider probing the channels with a coherent source, |α〉, with mean particle number n0 = |α|2. Since the initial state is Gaussian and both E0 and E1 are Gaussian channels, the output states are fully described by their first and second statistical moments. Let the source mode be φ. Using the technique described in [\cite=Dragan2012] we find that E1(ρ) is a displaced thermal state, with thermal number n, and displacement [formula] where (  ·  ,  ·  ) is the Klein-Gordon scalar product. Similarly, E0(ρ) is found to be a coherent state, with displacement [formula]. Since E0(ρ) is pure the QCB reduces to the Fidelity, F, [\cite=Spedalieri], and the probability of error is:

[formula]

Therefore, coherent probes enhance the discrimination of the Unruh effect in a fashion which scales exponentially with the energy. The strategy which achieves this probability of error, corresponds to the measurement observables E0 = |α0〉〈α0| and [formula], which is in practice performable with a Kennedy receiver [\cite=Weedbrook2012]. -Optimized discrimination with Gaussian states. One naturally wonders how close the strategy presented in the previous section comes to being optimal. To find the optimal state, one must perform an exhaustive search over all initial states at fixed energy. Since this is not practical in full generality, we first focus on special classes of Gaussian states. General non-unitary Gaussian transformations can be written as a transformation of the first and second moments, [formula], and [formula] respectively [\cite=Serafini2005] [\cite=Aspachs]. For single-mode Gaussian states the Unruh channel is completely described by:

[formula]

Similarly, the H0 transformations {X0,Y0} are obtained by replacing ψ1  →  ψ0 and n  →  0 in ([\ref=H0GausTransfs]). Note that (ψ0,φ*) is zero in this case.

We first focus on the special case when the source prepares the state in an Unruh mode. Then [formula], (ψ1,φ*) = 0 and (ψ0,φ*) = 1, where the Unruh source mode is tuned to the same frequency as the Rindler detection mode. Equation ([\ref=H0GausTransfs]) then reduces to [formula] and [formula] as in [\cite=Aspachs]. For the coherent state of the previous section the exponential factor becomes: [formula]. For a Single-Mode Squeezed vacuum state (SMS) with n0  =   sinh 2s0, we find:

[formula]

which is proportional to the inverse square root of n0 as n0  →    ∞  . Therefore, at large energies the coherent state beats the SMS. Nevertheless, at low energies the SMS provides an enhanced sensitivity particularly in the low temperature (i.e., low n) regime, see Fig. [\ref=fig:Unruhplots] (Top).

The Optimal Single Mode Gaussian state (OSMG) is found by considering a displaced squeezed thermal state of fixed energy, n0  =   sinh 2s0 + m0 cosh 2s0  +  |α|2, where m0 is the thermal number of the initial state, and the state is displaced and squeezed in the p-quadrature direction [\cite=QCBdirectionopt]. The energy budget for the squeezing energy, thermal energy and displacement energy is given by the ratios κ1  =   sinh 2s0 / n0, κ2 = m0 cosh 2s0 / n0 and κ3 = |α|2 / n0 respectively, where κ1  +  κ2  +  κ3 = 1, [formula]. We find the optimal value κ2 = 0 for all values of the parameter space considered. Therefore, pure states are better probes of the E1 channel than mixed (thermal) states. The QCB error probabilities for the OSMG, coherent state and SMS are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Unruhplots] (Top).

To investigate the usefulness of entanglement, we also considered a two-mode one-party accelerated strategy, whereby an ancillary mode is entangled with the first but is measured in the inertial frame rather than the accelerated frame. The transformation matrices in this case are: [formula], [formula]. The quantum correlations of a Two-Mode Squeezed vacuum state (TMS) under the one-party accelerated motion setting have previously been investigated in [\cite=Doukas2012] [\cite=Dragan2012] [\cite=AdessoTMS]. Here we consider an initial two-mode squeezed state that is also displaced in the x-quadrature [\cite=QCBdirectionopt]. The QCB optimized over displacement and squeezing is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Unruhplots]. In the low energy regime entanglement helps to reveal the channels. In particular, the two-mode Gaussian state that we have considered (optimized over displacement and squeezing) can beat the OSMG, implying that entanglement can be a useful resource in the discrimination. However, the OSMG is still better for sufficiently large n0. -Fock states. Finally we consider the effects of non-Gaussianity by probing the channel with an n0 particle Fock state, ρ = |n0〉〈n0|, we find:

[formula]

where [formula]. These states generalize the ones found for Unruh modes in [\cite=Aspachs]. Consider the strategy of counting particles, choosing H1 when the number is larger than n0 and H0 otherwise. This corresponds to the measurement observables [formula] and [formula]. This strategy is not optimal for general initial modes, however it does attain the Helstrom bound when the source mode is Unruh with the probability of error:

[formula]

When in Unruh modes Fock states beat the optimized single-mode and two-mode strategies providing the best discrimination of the theories, see Fig. [\ref=fig:Unruhplots] (Bottom).

-A realistic example At low energies and Unruh temperatures Fock states and squeezed states clearly beat the coherent states in the Unruh mode setup. Since these states are readily producible in ordinary Minkowski frequency modes, could they be used to reveal the Unruh effect at low temperatures and low source energy?

To answer this question, let us investigate the following experimental arrangement. Consider a detector moving with uniform acceleration, a, and irradiate it with a quasi-monochromatic mode with a flat spectrum having a central frequency ω = a / 10 and spectral width δω  =  ω / 10. Further assume that the detector response is flat and operates at the Rindler frequency ωR = a / 10 with an equally narrow spectral range δωR  =  ωR / 10. We calculate: (ψ0,φ)  ≈  (ψ1,φ*) = 0.002 + 0.013i, (ψ1,φ) = 0.003 + 0.017i  and an expected vacuum particle number n = 1.07.

A comparison of the QCB for coherent, SMS, TMS, and Fock states is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:realistic]. In these modes, Fock states and SMS states perform worse than the vacuum strategy. Rather it is the coherent state which best discriminates the channels [\cite=optimal]. The non-trivial E0 channel therefore results in a different ordering of the strategies. The behavior of the SMS state, [formula], is consistent with our earlier analysis: [formula] is a squeezed thermal state whose thermal component worsens the discrimination between I and [formula]. In contrast coherent states remain pure under E0. While Fock states also get mixed under E0 precisely what role purity plays in the discrimination in this non-Gaussian case remains unknown. Interestingly, the TMS provides near-optimal discrimination implying that entanglement is still a useful resource.

-Discussion. Our analysis indicates that the Unruh theory can be tested using a coherent source at large energies. It appears to be the most practical strategy with arbitrarily low identification errors (exponentially decreasing with energy). Importantly, these results even apply when the source modes are quasi-monochromatic with respect to Minkowski time. This is because coherent states remain coherent under the E0 transformation. While coherent probes behave similarly in both Minkowski and Unruh settings, in the Minkowski case larger initial intensities are required. This is because Minkowski modes and Unruh modes are poorly matched resulting in an attenuated signal in the detection mode. One would best be able to discriminate the theories if it were possible to engineer initial modes in the Unruh basis.

It is interesting to compare our results to [\cite=Aspachs] where parameter estimation was used to optimally estimate the temperature felt by a uniformly accelerated detector, see also [\cite=Downes]. In parameter estimation strategies which best distinguish evolutions a and a + δa for some channel parameter a are sought. This differs to channel discrimination, which can be applied (as we have) to discriminate between two independent channels E0 and E1. In the case of Unruh modes, we found that Fock states, which were the best states to estimate the temperature in [\cite=Aspachs], also give the best discrimination of the theories. Nevertheless, if one uses realistic modes Fock states are not useful in the discrimination. It would be interesting to know if the same holds true in the problem of the parameter estimation of temperature [\cite=Aspachs].

Our analysis can be generalized to any theory with horizons, where the Rindler modes are replaced with modes localized inside or outside of the horizon. Furthermore, the tools of state and channel discrimination are also likely to be of use in other tests of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes especially in analogue experiments [\cite=Analogue] where Bogoliubov transformations act.
