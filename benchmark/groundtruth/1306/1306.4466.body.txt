New upper bound on block sensitivity and certificate complexity in terms of sensitivity

Introduction

Sensitivity  [\cite=CD82] [\cite=CDR86] and block sensitivity  [\cite=Nisan91] are two important complexity measures in decision tree complexity. It has been proven that block sensitivity is polynomially related to a number of other complexity measures: certificate complexity, polynomial degree, approximate degree, deterministic/randomized/quantum query complexity, etc. [\cite=BW02]. However, it is not known whether the simpler-to-define sensitivity has a similar property. The sensitivity-block sensitivity conjecture proposed by Nisan and Szegedy [\cite=Nisan94] suggests that for any total Boolean function f, the block sensitivity complexity and sensitivity complexity are polynomially related, i.e. bs(f) = O(s(f)O(1)).

The best known lower bound on bs(f) in terms of s(f) is quadratic and upper bound is exponential. Rubinstein [\cite=Rubinstein95] gave the first quadratic separation for block sensitivity and sensitivity by constructing a Boolean function f with [formula]. Virza [\cite=Virza10] improved the separation to [formula]. Ambainis and Sun [\cite=AS11] further improved the gap to [formula]. However, the best known upper bound on block sensitivity is

[formula]

given by Kenyon and Kutin [\cite=KK]. More information about sensitivity-block sensitivity conjecture can be found in a survey paper by Hatami et al. [\cite=HKP11] and in Scott Aaronson's blog post [\cite=Aaronson10].

In this paper, we give a new upper bound on certificate complexity (which is related to block sensitivity).

For any Boolean function f,

[formula]

This implies

We also introduce a new complexity measure called consistent block sensitivity, see section [\ref=sec:thm2] for the definition. Using it we prove another upper bound for block sensitivity.

For any Boolean function f,

[formula]

One consequence of this result is that,

If min {s0(f), s1(f)} = O(1), then bs(f) = O(s(f)).

This result suggests a stronger version of sensitivity-block sensitivity conjecture:

[formula]

The rest part of the paper is organized as follows: in Section [\ref=sec:preliminary] we give some basic definitions. We prove Theorem [\ref=thm:C(f)] in Section [\ref=sec:thm1] and Theorem [\ref=thm:bs(f)] in section [\ref=sec:thm2]. We conclude the paper in Section [\ref=sec:con].

Preliminaries

In this section, we give the basic definitions we use in this paper. See [\cite=BW02] for a survey on more complexity measures for decision trees and the relationships between them. Let f:{0,1}n  →  {0,1} be a total Boolean function.

The sensitivity complexity s(f,x) of f on input x is defined as the number of bits on which the function is sensitive, i.e. [formula], where x(i) is obtained by flipping the i-th bit of x. Define the sensitivity of f as [formula] and the 0-sensitivity and 1-sensitivity of f as [formula], [formula].

The block sensitivity complexity bs(f,x) of f on input x is defined as maximum number of pairwise disjoint subsets B1,...,Bk of

[formula]

The certificate complexity C(f,x) of f on input x is defined as the minimum length of a partial assignment of x such that f is constant on this restriction. Define the certificate complexity of f as [formula] and the 0-certificate and 1-certificate of f as [formula], [formula].

We introduce a new notation called consistent block sensitivity here.

The consistent block sensitivity of f on an input x (denoted cbs(f,x)) is equal to the maximum number k of blocks [formula] such that f(x)  ≠  f(x(Bi)) and [formula] have certificates [formula] such that there is an input y that satisfies all of Ci simultaneously. The consistent block sensitivity of f (denoted cbs(f)) is equal to the maximum of cbs(f,x) over all inputs x. The c- consistent block sensitivity of f (denoted cbsc(f)) is equal to the maximum of cbs(f,x) over all inputs x such that f(x) = c.

Upper bound for certificate complexity in terms of sensitivity

In this section we prove theorem [\ref=thm:C(f)]. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result.

Let f:{0,1}n  →  {0,1} be a Boolean function, then

[formula]

Proof  By symmetry we only need to prove C1(f)  ≤  2s0(f)  -  1s1(f)  -  (s0(f)  -  1). Without the loss of generality, we assume C1(f) = C(f,0n), i.e. the 1-certificate complexity is achieved on the input 0n. We have f(0n) = 1. We assume that the minimal certificate of 0n consists of [formula], where m = C(f,0n) = C1(f).

Let Q0 be the set of inputs x that satisfies [formula]. Since [formula] is a 1-certificate, we have [formula], f(x) = 1.

For each i∈[m], let Qi be the set of inputs x with [formula] and xi  =  1. Let S be the total sensitivity of all inputs [formula]. It consists of three parts: sensitivity between Qi and Q0 (denoted by S1), sensitivity inside Qi (denoted by S2) and sensitivity between Qi and other input (denoted by S3), i.e.

[formula]

In the following we estimate S1,S2 and S3 separately. We use [formula] to denote the set of 0-inputs in [formula], respectively, i.e. Ai  =  {x∈Qi|f(x) = 0} (i∈[m]). Since [formula] is the minimal certificate, i.e. Q0 is maximal, thus [formula] are all nonempty.

We will use the following isoperimetric inequality for the Boolean hypercube.

[\cite=Bol] For any A  ⊆  {0,1}n, the edges between A and [formula] is lower bounded by

[formula]

We also need the following lemma which follows from Lemma [\ref=lem:iso] but can be also proven without using it [\cite=Sim]:

[\cite=Sim] For any i∈[m],

[formula]

The sensitivity between Qi and Q0 is |Ai|. By summing over all possible i we get:

[formula]

Sensitivity inside [formula]: By Lemma [\ref=lem:iso], for each i∈[m], the number of edges between Ai and [formula] is bounded by:

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Sensitivity between Qi and other inputs: For each 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  m, let Qi,j be the set of inputs that are adjacent to both Qi and Qj, i.e. Qi,j is the set of inputs x that satisfy [formula] and xi  =  xj  =  1. The sensitivity between Qi,Qj and Qi,j is lower bounded by

[formula]

where ei is the unit vector with the i-th coordinate equal to 1 and all other coordinates equal to 0. Then, x + ei, x + ej are the neighbors of x in Qi and Qj, respectively. Summing over all possible pairs of (i,j) we get

[formula]

If we combine inequalities ([\ref=eq5.3])-([\ref=eq5.5]), we get

[formula]

Since s(f,x) is upper bounded by s0(f) or s1(f) (depending on whether f(x) = 0 or f(x) = 1), we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

We use w to denote the total number of 0-inputs in [formula]. Then,

[formula]

The inequality ([\ref=eq7]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

Also, s(f,x)  ≤  s1(f) for each x∈Q0. Thus, the right-hand side of inequality ([\ref=eq5.6]) is

[formula]

By combining inequalities ([\ref=eq5.6])-([\ref=eq5.8]) we get

[formula]

By rearranging the inequality we get

[formula]

Since the function g(x) = x log 2x is convex, we know that |Ai|  ≤  |Qi| = 2n - m. From Lemma [\ref=lem:Ai] |Ai|  ≥  2n - m - s0(f) + 1. Therefore,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

By combining inequalities ([\ref=eq8]) and ([\ref=eq9]), we get

[formula]

It implies that

[formula]

Substituting [formula], we get

[formula]

i.e.

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Upper bound for block sensitivity in terms of sensitivity

First we show that the consistent block sensitivity is no more than sensitivity.

sb(f)  ≥  cbsb(f) for any b∈{0,1}.

Proof  We prove s0(f)  ≥  cbs0(f) here. Without the loss of generality assume that the maximum cbs0(f) = k is achieved on the input 0n. Let |Bi| = bi. We denote the variables in the block Bi as xi,1,xi,2, [formula], xi,bi. We further assume that blocks Bi are minimal.

Since Ci is a certificate for x(Bi), it must include conditions xi,1 = 1, xi,2 = 1, [formula], xi,bi = 1 and no other conditions xj = 1. (If Ci included some other xj = 1, it would not be satisfied by x(Bi). If Ci did not include xi,j = 1, it would also be satisfied by x(Bi  -  (i,j)) - contradicting the assumption that Bi is minimal.)

Moreover, Ci must not include a condition xi',j = 0 for i'  ≠  i. (Otherwise, it would be impossible to satisfy Ci and Ci' simultaneously.) Hence, Ci consists of xi,1 = 1, xi,2 = 1, [formula], xi,bi = 1 and, possibly, xj = 0 for some variables j that do not belong to any of Bi.

We say that an input y has a type [formula] if yi = 0 for all [formula] and, for every [formula], the number of yi,j = 1 is equal to ti.

Assume that s0(f) < k. Then, for every input y of type [formula], t1 < b1, [formula], tk < bk, f(y) = 1.

Substituting [formula] leads to the conclusion f(0n) = 1 which is in a contradiction with our initial assumption f(0n) = 0. Hence, the assumption s0(f) < k is wrong and we must have s0(f)  ≥  k  =  cbs0(f).

Proof  (of Claim [\ref=cl:contra]) By induction on [formula].

The smallest possible value is B = k (if ti = bi - 1 for all i). This is our base case. In this case, there is one variable yi,j = 0 for each i. Then y(i,j) satisfies the certificate Ci. Hence, f(y(i,j)) = 1. This means that, if f(y) = 0, then y is sensitive to k variables yi,j - one for each [formula]. Thus, s0(f) < k implies f(y) = 1.

For the inductive case, we assume that Claim is true for B = B0 - 1 and prove that this implies Claim being true for B = B0. Let y be an input for which B = B0. We choose yi,j = 0 for each [formula]. (Such yi,j always exists, since ti < bi.) We claim that f(y(i,j)) = 1. (If ti = bi - 1, then, with yi,j = 1 we have [formula] and the certificate Ci is satisfied. Hence, f(y(i,j)) = 1. If ti < bi - 1, then y(i,j) is an input of type [formula] and f(y(i,j)) = 1 follows from the inductive assumption.) By the same argument as in the previous case, this implies f(y) = 1.

Next we upper bound block sensitivity by certificate complexity and consistent block sensitivity.

[formula].

Together with Theorem [\ref=thm:cbs1], this implies

[formula].

Proof  (of Theorem [\ref=thm:cbs2]) We use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:cbs1]. Also, we again assume that the maximum bs0(f) is achieved on the input x = 0n and the sensitive blocks Bi are minimal.

We consider a graph G with m = bs0(f) vertices v1, [formula], vbs0(f), with an edge (vi,vj) if the certificates Ci and Cj are consistent. The size of the largest clique in this graph is at most cbs0(f). By Turan's theorem, a graph not containing a clique of size k + 1, k  =  cbs0(f) has at most [formula] edges.

Therefore [formula] (the complement of graph G) has at least

[formula]

edges. Each of those edges corresponds to a pair of certificates Ci, Cj that are not consistent.

Since Ci is a certificate for x(Bi) and Bi is minimal, Ci must consist of conditions xi,1 = 1, [formula], xi,bi = 1 and xj = 0 for some j∉Bi. (This follows in the same way as the similar statement in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:cbs1].)

If Ci and Cj are inconsistent, then either Ci contains a condition xj,l = 0 (which is not consistent with xj,l = 1 in Cj) or Cj contains a condition xi,l = 0 (which is not consistent with xi,l = 1 in Ci). Since |Ci|  ≤  C1(f), Ci may contain conditions xj,l = 0 for at most C1(f) - 1 different j. This means that the number of edges in [formula] is at most m(C1(f) - 1). Together with ([\ref=eq:turan]), this implies

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=thm:bs(f)].

Proof  (of Theorem [\ref=thm:bs(f)]) From Theorem [\ref=thm:C(f)] C0(f)  ≤  2s1(f) - 1s0(f), hence

[formula]

From Corollary [\ref=cor:cbs2] we have [formula], together with Theorem [\ref=thm:C(f)] we get

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Similarly we can show that

[formula]

Conclusions

In this paper we proved an upper bound for certificate complexity in terms of sensitivity, which also implies upper bound on block sensitivity in terms of sensitivity. We also introduce the concept of consistent block sensitivity. We then use it to prove that block sensitivity and sensitivity are linear related if min {s0(f),s1(f)} = O(1). This suggests a refined version of the sensitivity-block sensitivity question: is it true that
