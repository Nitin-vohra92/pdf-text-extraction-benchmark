A short note on Jacobsthal's function

Introduction

Jacobsthal's function g(n) represents the smallest number Q such that every sequence of Q consecutive integers contains an integer coprime to n. This function has been studied by a number of different authors, and is central to results on the maximal gaps between consecutive primes [\cite=MaierPomerance] [\cite=Pintz] and on the least prime in arithmetic progressions [\cite=Pomerance]. Taking k to represent ω(n), the number of distinct prime factors of n, Iwaniec's proof [\cite=Iwaniec] that for some unknown constant X gives the best asymptotic upper bound on g(n). The best known explicit upper bounds, of

[formula]

are due to Kanold [\cite=Kanold] and Stevens [\cite=Stevens] respectively, with the second bound being stronger for k  ≥  260. In this short note we describe improvements on Stevens' method that give a better bound of

[formula]

for k > 120, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

We take p to represent some prime and pi to represent the [formula] prime. Because [formula], we may assume that n is squarefree. For computational reasons, we assume k  >  61. Define

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where s  ≥  1. Given these definitions Stevens proves that if an odd value of s is chosen such that P > T's, then g(n)  ≤  Q when

[formula]

To determine suitable values of s, Stevens first notes that From [\cite=RosserSchoenfeld] we have for k  >  61 where

[formula]

and B = 0.261498, and so for all r  ≤  k. We thus have with the last inequality arising from the remainder term in the Taylor expansion of elog (Ck log pk). Since from Stirling's approximation (s + 1)!  >  ((s + 1) / e)s + 1 and since from [\cite=RosserSchoenfeld] we have

[formula]

for k > 61, where

[formula]

we have

[formula]

We now wish to find s such that

[formula]

Changing variables to

[formula]

we can rewrite [\eqref=PminusTBound] as

[formula]

and so [\eqref=PminusTBound] will hold if

[formula]

holds. Taking logs on both sides and rearranging [\eqref=inequality2] holds if

[formula]

holds. The right-hand side of this inequality is a monotonically decreasing function of k with the limit 2 / e, and so [\eqref=PminusTBound] holds if we define

[formula]

where Z = 2.159569 is a solution to

[formula]

We thus see that [\eqref=PminusTBound] holds when s is an odd integer such that

[formula]

This holds if s is either

[formula]

or

[formula]

(one of which is odd) and so from [\eqref=stevens], [\eqref=PminusT] and [\eqref=PminusTBound] we see that

[formula]

Simplifying and using the fact that

[formula]

we get

[formula]

Finally we note that all terms of this exponent except 2Z log  log pk are either constant or monotonically decreasing with k, so if we calculate their values for some fixed k0 and substitute, the bound will hold for all k  ≥  k0. We select k0 = 82 we get

[formula]

for k  ≥  82. Since Kanold's bound is better for k < 82, this result is valid for all k  >  0.

Since it is more useful to represent g(n) in terms of k rather than pk, and in terms of integers, we note that for k  >  384 we have log pk  <  ( log k)1.1576 and that 2  ×  Z  ×  1.1576  <  5, and so we have

[formula]

for all k  >  384. By explicit calculation of the bound in [\eqref=fullBound] we find that [\eqref=simpleBound] also holds for k in the range [formula], giving our required result.
