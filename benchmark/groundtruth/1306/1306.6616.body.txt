Differential rapidity cross sections for heavy quark state production at ALICE

This brief report is a continuation of our work on Υ(nS) production which was published recently[\cite=kd13]. It is in anticipation of the publication of new ALICE experimental results[\cite=hxlalice13] on J / Ψ(1S),Ψ(2S), and Υ(nS) production in the rapidity range 2.5  ≤  y  ≤  4.0.

The differential rapidity cross section for λ = 0 (dominant for Υ(nS),Ψ(nS) production) is given by [\cite=kmm11]

[formula]

with a = 4m2 / s, s = E2, E = 7.0 TeV, m =  5.0 GeV for Upsilon and 1.5 GeV for Charmonium states, fg the gluonic distribution function, and [formula] given in Refs[\cite=kmm11],[\cite=kd13]. For Upsilon, Charmonium a = 2.04  ×  10- 6,1.8  ×  10- 7. Φ in Eq([\ref=dsig]) is either Ψ or Υ, with AΥ = 1.74  ×  10- 8 and AΨ = 6.46  ×  10- 7.

The gluonic distribution fg(x(y),2m) for the range of x needed for E = 7.0 TeV is[\cite=kmm11]

[formula]

The calculation of the production of Υ(3S) and Ψ(2S) states is done with the usual quark-antiquark model, and with the mixed heavy hybrid theory[\cite=lsk09]. With these parameters we find for the differential rapidity cross sections for Υ(1S) and Υ(2S) production as shown in the figures below.

The differential rapidity cross sections for Υ(3S) production with the hybrid and standard theories are shown in the figure below.

The differential rapidity cross section for J / Ψ(1S) is shown in the figures below.

The differential rapidity cross sections for Ψ(2S) production with the hybrid and standard theories are shown in the figure below.

For Υ(3S) and Ψ(2S) the standard q prediction is shown by dashed curves, while the prediction using the mixed hybrid theory[\cite=lsk09] is shown with solid curves, with the difference explained in Ref[\cite=kmm11].

Conclusions

We expect that our results for the rapidity dependence of dσ/dy shown in the figures can be useful for experimentalists studing heavy quark production in p-p collisions at the LHC. It is also a test of the validity of the mixed heavy quark hybrid theory, which we are using to test the creation of the Quark Gluon Plasma via relativistic heavy ion collisions.
