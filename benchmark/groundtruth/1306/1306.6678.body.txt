Invertible extensions of symmetric operators and the corresponding generalized resolvents.

S.M. Zagorodnyuk

Introduction.

Let A be a closed symmetric invertible operator in a Hilbert space H. The domain of A is not supposed to be necessarily dense in H. Let [formula] be a self-adjoint extension of A, acting in a Hilbert space [formula]. Recall that an operator-valued function [formula], given by the following relation:

[formula]

is said to be a generalized resolvent of the symmetric operator A (corresponding to the extension [formula]). Fix an arbitrary point [formula]. An arbitrary generalized resolvent [formula] of the operator A is given by Shtraus's formula:

[formula]

where F(λ) is a function from [formula]. Conversely, an arbitrary function [formula] defines by relation ([\ref=f11_3_p2_1]) a generalized resolvent [formula] of the operator A. Moreover, for different functions from [formula] there correspond different generalized resolvents of the operator A. By [formula] we denote a set of all operator-valued functions [formula], which are λ0-admissible with respect to the operator A. Throughout this paper we shall use the notations from the survey paper [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk].

Our main aim here is to characterize those generalized resolvents [formula], which are generated by an (at least one) invertible self-adjoint extension. Such generalized resolvents we shall call generalized I-resolvents. A generalized I-resolvent will be described by Shtraus's formula ([\ref=f11_3_p2_1]), where the parameter F(λ) satisfies a boundary condition at 0. As a by-product, using the generalized Neumann's formulas we describe all invertible extensions of a symmetric operator inside H.

Notations. As it was already mentioned, in this paper we use notations from [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk].

Invertible extensions.

Let A be a closed symmetric invertible operator in a Hilbert space H. Let z from [formula] ([formula]) be a fixed number. Recall that the following formulas (see [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk])

[formula]

[formula]

establish a one-to-one correspondence between all admissible with respect to A isometric operators T, D(T)  ⊆  Nz(A), [formula], and all symmetric extensions B of the operator A. We have

[formula]

[formula]

Formulas ([\ref=f4_1_p2_1]),([\ref=f4_2_p2_1]) define a one-to-one correspondence between all admissible with respect to A non-expanding operators T, D(T)  ⊆  Nz(A), [formula], and all dissipative (respectively accumulative) extensions B of the operator A. Relations ([\ref=f4_3_p2_1]),([\ref=f4_4_p2_1]) hold in this case, as well.

Consider the Cayley transformation of the operator A:

[formula]

The operator B may be also determined by the following relations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

It is readily checked that

[formula]

[formula]

Let A be a closed symmetric invertible operator in a Hilbert space H, and [formula] be a fixed point. Let T be an admissible with respect to A non-expanding operator with D(T)  ⊆  Nz(A), [formula]. The following two conditions are equivalent:

The operator B, defined by ([\ref=f4_1_p2_1]) and ([\ref=f4_2_p2_1]), is invertible;

The operator [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1.

Proof. From relation ([\ref=f2_0_1_p2_1]) it follows that B is invertible if and only if the operator [formula] has no non-zero fixed elements. By ([\ref=f2_0_2_p2_1]),([\ref=k1_2]) we see that

[formula]

It remains to apply Theorem 3.6 from [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]. [formula]

Let A be a closed symmetric invertible operator in a Hilbert space H. Suppose that A has finite defect numbers. Then there exists an invertible self-adjoint operator [formula] in a Hilbert space [formula].

Proof. Let the operator A from the formulation of the theorem have the deficiency index (n,m), [formula], [formula]. Set [formula] and [formula]. The closed symmetric operator A has equal defect numbers. Fix an arbitrary number [formula]. Let {fk}n + mk = 1 be an orthonormal basis in Nz(A). Set

[formula]

where [formula] is an arbitrary element such that [formula], and [formula] if [formula]; [formula] if f1∈D(Xz(A)). The operator T with the domain [formula] is z-admissible with respect to A and condition (iii) holds for A. By Theorem [\ref=tk1_1] the symmetric extension B, corresponding to T, is invertible. The defect numbers of B are equal to n + m - 1. If B is not self-adjoint, we can take B instead of A in the above construction to obtain a closed symmetric extension with the deficiency index (n + m - 2,n + m - 2). Repeating this procedure we shall construct a self-adjoint invertible extension of A. [formula]

Generalized resolvents.

Consider a closed symmetric invertible operator A in a Hilbert space H. Choose and fix an arbitrary point [formula]. A function [formula] is said to be λ0-I-admissible with respect to the operator A, if the validity of

[formula]

[formula]

for some ε: [formula], implies ψ  =  0.

A set of all operator-valued functions [formula] which are λ0-I-admissible with respect to the operator A, we shall denote by

[formula]

In the case [formula], we have [formula] and therefore [formula].

Let A be a closed symmetric invertible operator in a Hilbert space H, and [formula] be an arbitrary point. An arbitrary generalized I-resolvent [formula] of the operator A has the following form:

[formula]

where F(λ) is a function from [formula]. Conversely, an arbitrary function [formula] defines by relation ([\ref=k2_3]) a generalized I-resolvent [formula] of the operator A. Moreover, for different functions from [formula] there correspond different generalized I-resolvents of the operator A.

Proof. Let A be a closed symmetric invertible operator in a Hilbert space H, [formula].

Let us prove the first statement of the theorem. Let [formula] be an arbitrary generalized I-resolvent of the operator A. The generalized I-resolvent [formula] is generated by a self-adjoint invertible operator [formula] in a Hilbert space [formula]. Repeating the arguments from the proof of Theorem 3.34 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] we obtain a representation ([\ref=k2_3]), where F(λ) is a function from [formula]. It remains to check that [formula].

The self-adjoint extension [formula] of the operator A- 1 in a Hilbert space [formula] generates the following objects, see Subsection 3.6 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]: the operator-valued function [formula], [formula]; the operator [formula]; the operator-valued function [formula], [formula]; the operator [formula].

On the other hand, the operator A can be identified with the operator

[formula]

with Ae  =  oH, in the Hilbert space

[formula]

where [formula], see Subsection 3.5 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]. Then

[formula]

By the generalized Neumann's formulas, for [formula] there corresponds an isometric operator T, D(T)  =  Nλ0(A), [formula], which is λ0-admissible with respect to A. Moreover, since the operator [formula] is invertible, then by Theorem [\ref=tk1_1] we conclude that the operator [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1.

Applying Theorem 3.16 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] for the operator A- 1, with [formula], we obtain that the operator [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1.

By the generalized Neumann's formulas, for [formula] there corresponds an isometric operator V, [formula], [formula], which is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1. Consider the following operator [formula], see (3.38) in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]:

[formula]

Comparing this definition with the definition of the operator [formula] we conclude that

[formula]

Applying Theorem 3.20 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] for the operator [formula], with [formula], we get:

[formula]

On the other hand, by the definition of [formula] we have:

[formula]

Then

[formula]

By the generalized Neumann's formulas ([\ref=f4_3_p2_1]),([\ref=f4_4_p2_1]) we get:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

By ([\ref=k2_8]) we get:

[formula]

Therefore the operator [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1.

The self-adjoint operator [formula] in a Hilbert space [formula] generates the operator-valued function [formula], [formula], and the operator-valued function [formula], λ∈Πλ0 (see [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]). Denote (see [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk])

[formula]

[formula]

We shall also need sets [formula], [formula], [formula], constructed by ([\ref=f6_3_p2_1]) with the operators A- 1,[formula] instead of A,[formula].

Choose an arbitrary element [formula], [formula]. Then [formula], and

[formula]

Therefore [formula], and

[formula]

In order to obtain the equality:

[formula]

it remains to apply the proved inclusion for the operators A- 1, [formula] instead of A, [formula], and with [formula] instead of λ.

The operator [formula], [formula], is invertible, see considerations below (3.48) in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]. By the definition of [formula] we may write:

[formula]

Applying this representation for the operators A- 1, [formula] instead of A, [formula], and with [formula] instead of λ we get:

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

By the definition of the operator-valued function [formula] and by ([\ref=k2_12]) we may write:

[formula]

and, also for λ∈Πλ0, we have:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore

[formula]

Suppose that relations ([\ref=k2_1]),([\ref=k2_2]) with [formula] hold for some ε: [formula]. Then using the change of a variable [formula] we get:

[formula]

[formula]

By ([\ref=k2_13]) we obtain that

[formula]

Substituting this expression in relations ([\ref=k2_14]),([\ref=k2_15]) we get:

[formula]

[formula]

By Theorem 3.32 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] we conclude that [formula], and

[formula]

Since [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1, we obtain that ψ  =  0. Consequently, [formula].

Let us check the second statement of the theorem. Let F(λ) be an arbitrary function from [formula]. We shall use the following lemma.

Let [formula]: [formula]. There exists a closed symmetric invertible operator A in a Hilbert space H, [formula], [formula], which has the deficiency index (n,m).

Proof. Let H0 be an arbitrary Hilbert space, and [formula] be an orthonormal basis in H0. Consider the following operator (unilateral shift):

[formula]

with D(V0)  =  H0. The operator V0 is closed, isometric, and its deficiency index is (0,1). The condition V0g  =    ±  g, for an element g∈H0, implies g = 0. Consequently, the inverse Cayley transformation:

[formula]

is a closed symmetric invertible operator in H0, with the deficiency index (0,1). If h∈H0 and [formula], then V*0h  =    ∓  h. The condition V*0h  =  V- 10PH0R(V0)h  =    ∓  h, for an element h∈H0, implies h = 0. Therefore, [formula], [formula]. Set

[formula]

Wl is a closed isometric operator in Hl. The deficiency index of Wl is equal to (0,l + 1). If Wlh  =    ±  h, or W*lh  =    ±  h, then h = 0. Then

[formula]

is a closed symmetric invertible operator in Hl, with the deficiency index (0,l + 1), [formula]. Moreover, we have [formula], [formula]. Observe that the operator - Al has the deficiency index (l + 1,0), [formula]. If m > 0,n > 0, we set

[formula]

[formula]

Let us return to the proof of the theorem. If the operator A is self-adjoint, then the set [formula] consists of a unique function F(λ) = oH. Of course, this function generates the resolvent of A by ([\ref=k2_3]). Thus, we can assume that A is not self-adjoint.

We shall use the scheme of the proof of the corresponding statement in Theorem 3.34 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]. By Lemma [\ref=lk2_1] there exists a closed symmetric invertible operator A1 in a Hilbert space H1, [formula], [formula], which has the same defect numbers as A. Let U and W be arbitrary isometric operators, which map respectively Nλ0(A1) on Nλ0(A), and [formula] on [formula]. Set F1(λ)  =  W- 1F(λ)U, λ∈Πλ0. Since F1(λ) belongs to [formula], by Shtraus's formula it generates a generalized resolvent [formula] of A1.

Let us check that [formula] is generated by a self-adjoint invertible operator [formula] in a Hilbert space [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is generated by a self-adjoint operator Â1  ⊇  A1 in a Hilbert space Ĥ1  ⊇  H1. Suppose that Ui(Â1)h  =   - h, for an element h∈Ĥ1. Then

[formula]

[formula]

In particular, h is orthogonal to (Ui(A1)  +  EH1)D(Ui(A1))  =  R(A1). Then [formula]. Set

[formula]

Observe that Ĥ0 is a subspace of [formula]. Then

[formula]

where [formula].

Notice that Ui(Â1)Ĥ0  =  Ĥ0 and [formula]. Set [formula]. There are no non-zero elements [formula] such that W1g  =    -  g. Then the inverse Cayley transformation

[formula]

is invertible. Since [formula], then

[formula]

Therefore [formula] generates [formula].

Set

[formula]

Starting from the same formula, we repeat the rest of the arguments in the proof of Theorem 3.34 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk]. In what follows, we shall use notations and constructions from this proof without additional references. We shall obtain a self-adjoint operator [formula] in a Hilbert space [formula], which generates a generalized resolvent [formula] of A. This generalized resolvent is related to F(λ) by ([\ref=k2_3]). It remains to check that the operator [formula] is invertible.

Since the operator [formula] is invertible, then by Theorem [\ref=tk1_1] we obtain that the operator [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 11. By Theorem 3.16 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] we conclude that the operators [formula] and [formula] are [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 11 and A- 1e = Ae, respectively.

Comparing the domains of [formula] and [formula] we conclude that

[formula]

Using Remark 3.15 and formula (3.28) in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] for [formula] and [formula], we get:

[formula]

We can apply the arguments in the proof of the already proved first statement of the theorem for the operator A: = A1; the point λ0; the generalized I-resolvent [formula] of A1, which is generated by the self-adjoint invertible operator [formula] in [formula].

[formula]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

By Theorem 3.32 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] we have:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula].

Using ([\ref=k2_17_1]),([\ref=k2_20]),([\ref=k2_21]),([\ref=k2_22]),([\ref=k2_22_1]) and the change of a variable: [formula], we obtain that

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Suppose that there exists an element [formula] such that the following equality holds:

[formula]

By ([\ref=k2_23]),([\ref=k2_24]) this means that ψ∈Nλ0(A) and

[formula]

[formula]

Since F(λ) is λ0-I-admissible with respect to the operator A, we get ψ  =  0.

This means that [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1. Since [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to Ae, then by Theorem 3.16 in [\cite=cit_1000_Zagorodnyuk] we obtain that the operator [formula] is [formula]-admissible with respect to A- 1. By Theorem [\ref=tk1_1] we conclude that the operator [formula] is invertible.

The last statement of the theorem follows directly from Shtraus's formula. [formula]

Invertible extensions of symmetric operators and the corresponding generalized resolvents.

S.M. Zagorodnyuk

In this paper we study invertible extensions of a symmetric operator in a Hilbert space H. All such extensions are characterized by a parameter in the generalized Neumann's formulas. Generalized resolvents, which are generated by the invertible extensions, are extracted by a boundary condition among all generalized resolvents in the Shtraus formula.
