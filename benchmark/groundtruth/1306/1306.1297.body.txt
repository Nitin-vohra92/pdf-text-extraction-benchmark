On the distribution of local times and integral functionals of a homogeneous diffusion process

Introduction

We consider a family [formula] of one-dimensional homogeneous diffusion processes defined on a complete filtered probability space [formula] by a stochastic differential equation with the initial condition [formula]; here [formula] is a standard Ft-Wiener process. If the initial condition is not important, we will denote the process in question by X. Let the coefficients a,b of equation ([\ref=f1]) be continuous and satisfy any conditions of the existence of a non-explosive weak solution on [formula]. Assume also [formula] for [formula]. Let also [formula] [formula]. Below we introduce several objects related to the family [formula].

The generator of diffusion process X is defined for [formula] as

[formula]

Define the functions

[formula]

It is easy to see that for a fixed [formula] the function Φ(x0,  ·  ) solves a second order homogeneous differential equation LΦ(x0,  ·  ) = 0.

For [formula], let τxy  =   inf {t  ≥  0,Xxt = y} be the first moment of hitting point y. For any [formula] and x∈(a,b), let [formula] be the first moment of exiting interval (a,b). (We use the convention [formula].)

For any t > 0 and [formula], define a local time of process Xx at the point y on the interval

[formula]

. It is evident from ([\ref=f4]) that yλ,  +(x) is increasing in λ for x > 0. It is also increasing in x, therefore, 0  ≤  yλ,  +(s)  ≤  (E0e-  τ0x)- 1. Consequently,

[formula]

The same conclusion holds for x < 0. In this case we change the sign of Φ(s,x) and note that 0  ≤  yλ,  +(s)  ≤  1 for s < 0. Now we can find [formula]. Note at first that it follows from the representations ([\ref=f4]) that yλ,  +(x) and yλ,  -(x) are continuous in λ for any [formula]. Therefore the left-hand side of ([\ref=f10]) and the integral in its right-hand side are continuous in λ. It means that yλ,  +'(0) and (yλ,  -)'(0) are continuous in λ as well. So, the limits [formula] are equal to the values of the corresponding derivatives at zero:

[formula]

Further, for any λ > 0 we have the equalities [formula], therefore, [formula]. We can conclude that similarly, From [\eqref=Ptaux<y]-[\eqref=Ptaux>y] we have that for x < 0, and for x > 0. Note that

[formula]

Hence, we obtain Substitute these limits into ([\ref=f10])-([\ref=f11]), we obtain from the properties of the functions Φ and φ that Now the proof follows from [\eqref=f2].

1. In each of the cases: x = y; x < y and -  Φ(0, -   ∞  )  =    +    ∞  ; x > y and Φ(0, +   ∞  )  =    +    ∞  , the local time Lx∞(y) is exponentially distributed with parameter ψy(0) given by [\eqref=psix].

2. If x < y and -  Φ(0, -   ∞  )  <    +    ∞  , then the local time Lx∞(y) is distributed as κξ, where ξ is exponentially distributed with parameter ψy(0), κ is an independent of ξ Bernoulli random variable with

[formula]

3. If x > y and Φ(0, +   ∞  )  <    +    ∞  , then the local time Lx∞(y) is distributed as κξ, where ξ is exponentially distributed with parameter ψy(0), κ is an independent of ξ Bernoulli random variable with

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be constant. Then φ(x,y)  =  e- 2b(y - x) / a2, [formula] for b  ≠  0 and Φ(x,y)  =  y - x for b = 0. In this case diffusion process X is transient if and only if b  ≠  0, moreover, -  Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  +   ∞     and Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <  +   ∞   for b > 0, and -  Φ(0, -   ∞  ) <  +   ∞  , Φ(0, +   ∞  ) =  +   ∞   for b < 0. The cases are symmetric, therefore we will consider only the case b > 0.

Equation [\eqref=f3] is a linear equation with constant coefficients, so its general solution has a form [formula]. The increasing and decreasing solutions are [formula] and [formula], respectively. Therefore,

[formula]

Hence, [formula] which coincides with the result of Theorem [\ref=thm:psix], since in this case

[formula]

Thus, for x  ≤  y the local time Lx∞(y) is exponentially distributed with a parameter [formula]. For x > y the local time is distributed as κξ, where ξ has an exponential distribution with a parameter [formula] and κ is Bernoulli random variable independent of ξ and distributed as [formula] Using the properties of exponential distribution, we see that these cases can be combined: [formula], where [formula].

Let [formula] and b(x) = x. Then [formula] and Φ(x,y)  =  (1 + x2)( arctan y  -   arctan x). We see that the process is transient and [formula].

Due to Corollary [\ref=cor1], the local time Lx∞(y) is distributed as κξ, where ξ has an exponential distribution with a parameter and κ is Bernoulli random variable, which is independent of ξ and distributed as

[formula]

Integral functionals of a transient diffusion processes

For a measurable function [formula] such that f and f  /  a2 are locally integrable, define the integral functional

[formula]

We will study the questions of finiteness and existence of moments of Jx∞(f). We start with the well-known occupation density formula (see e.g. [\cite=b3] [\cite=b1]):

[formula]

If the process Xx is recurrent, then Lx∞(y) =   ∞   a.s. for all [formula], so Jx∞(f) is undefined unless f is identically zero. Therefore, we will require that the process X is transient. We remind that this holds iff Φ(0, +   ∞  ) of Φ(0, -   ∞  ) is finite. Moreover, if Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞  , then Xxs  →    +    ∞   a.s.; if Φ(0, +   ∞  ) =   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) >  -   ∞   then Xxs  →    -    ∞   a.s.; if Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) >  -   ∞   then Xxs  →    +    ∞   on a set A+ of positive probability, and Xxs  →    -    ∞   on a set [formula] of positive probability.

We start with a criterion of almost sure finiteness of Jx∞(f). It was obtained in [\cite=salmyourkhosh] in the case where only one of the integrals Φ(0, +   ∞  ) of Φ(0, -   ∞  ) is finite; the complete analysis was made in [\cite=mijauru]. Define

[formula]

For arbitrary [formula], the following statements hold.

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞  .

If I1(f) <  +   ∞  , then [formula] a.s.

If I1(f)  =    ∞   then Jx∞(f) =   ∞   a.s.

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) =   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) >  -   ∞  .

If I2(f) <  +   ∞  , then [formula] a.s.

If I2(f) =  -   ∞   then Jx∞(f) =   ∞   a.s.

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) >  -   ∞  .

If I1(f) <  +   ∞  , then [formula] a.s. on A+.

If I1(f)  =    ∞   then Jx∞(f) =   ∞   a.s. on A+.

If I2(f) <  +   ∞  , then [formula] a.s. on A-.

If I2(f) =  +   ∞   then Jx∞(f) =   ∞   a.s. on A-.

In what follows consider the case when Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞  , other cases being similar. Next result is a direct consequence of Corollary [\ref=cor1].

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞  . Then for any k  ≥  1

[formula]

and

[formula]

for x > y.

Let a = 1, b = μ > 0 with some constant μ, so that X is a Brownian motion with a constant positive drift. Furthermore, in this case Φ(y, +   ∞  ) = 1 / 2μ, φ(y,x) =  exp { - 2μ(x - y)}, Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞  . Therefore, the criterion for J∞(f) to be finite is [formula], which coincides with that of [\cite=SalmYor]. As to the moments of local times, in this case [formula] for x  ≤  y and [formula] for x > y.

Further we derive conditions for [formula] to be finite.

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞   and I1(f) <  +   ∞  . Assume additionally that

[formula]

Then

[formula]

The statement immediately follows from Lemma [\ref=lem1] and the Fubini theorem.

For a Brownian motion with a positive drift μ, a sufficient condition for [formula] to be finite is

[formula]

and in that case the equality

[formula]

holds. Obviously, the requirement [formula] is also sufficient, which is stated in [\cite=SalmYor].

Consider the class of locally integrable functions

[formula]

It follows from Theorems [\ref=miur] and [\ref=theo3] that for any function f from this class the integral Jx∞(f) exists, and its expectation is finite.

Now we continue with the moments of J∞(f) of higher order.

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞  . The moments of higher order admit the following bound: for any k > 1

[formula]

We use representation [\eqref=eq1.17] and the generalized Minkowski inequality to get the following equalities and bounds:

[formula]

Now [\eqref=eq1.19] follows immediately from [\eqref=equ1.20] and Lemma [\ref=lem1].

We conclude with the existence of potential and exponential moments. Some related results were obtained in [\cite=salmyorkhosh].

The integral functional J∞(f) has a bounded potential P if

[formula]

The following result is an immediate corollary of Theorem [\ref=theo3].

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞   and

[formula]

Then the integral functional J∞(f) has a bounded potential P  ≤  P0.

Let Φ(0, +   ∞  ) <   +    ∞  ,Φ(0, -   ∞  ) =  -   ∞   and P0  <    ∞  . Then

[formula]

for λ  <  P0.

We apply the following result of Dellacherie and Meyer [\cite=deme], see also [\cite=SalmYor]. Let A be a continuous adapted non-decreasing process starting at zero such that there exists a constant C > 0 satisfying [formula] for any t  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

for λ  <  C- 1.

Set [formula]. Then it follows from Markov property of X and Theorems [\ref=theo3] and [\ref=theorem4] that [formula] for any t  ≥  0 whence the proof follows.
