Unbounded Order Convergence and Application to Martingales without Probability

Introduction

Recall that a net (xα)α∈Γ in a vector lattice X is order convergent (or, o-convergent for short) to x∈X if there exists another net (zβ)β∈Λ satisfying: (1) [formula]; (2) for any β∈Λ, there exists α0∈Γ such that [formula] for all α  ≥  α0. In this case, we write [formula]. In [\cite=dem64] [\cite=kap] [\cite=nak], the following notion was introduced and studied. In a vector lattice X, a net (xα) is unbounded order convergent (or, uo-convergent for short) to x∈X if [formula] for all y∈X+. In this case, we write [formula]. This is an analogue of pointwise convergence in function spaces. Indeed, it is easily seen that, in c0 or [formula], uo-convergence of nets is the same as coordinate-wise convergence, and that, in Lp(μ)(1  ≤  p <   ∞  ), uo-convergence of sequences is the same as almost everywhere convergence.

Of particular interest is to study geometric properties of Banach lattices by means of uo-convergence. In [\cite=wi77], Wickstead characterized the spaces in which weak convergence of nets implies uo-convergence and vice versa. Motivated by this, we study nets which have weak and uo-convergence properties simultaneously. In Section 3, we prove that, in an order continuous Banach lattice, a relatively weakly compact uo-convergent net is absolutely weakly convergent (Proposition [\ref=abs-con]). We also characterize the spaces in which every relatively weakly compact uo-convergent net is norm convergent to be the Banach lattices with the positive Schur property (Theorem  [\ref=psp]). Moreover, we use uo-convergence as a tool to give an alternative proof of the known result that, for an order continuous Banach lattice, the Dunford-Pettis theorem holds (i.e.  every relatively weakly compact subset is almost order bounded) iff the space has the positive Schur property (Theorem  [\ref=spsp]). In Section 4, we introduce the notion of uo-Cauchy nets which arises naturally from the study of martingales without probability in Section 5. An important question is to search for conditions under which a uo-Cauchy net is uo-convergent. We prove that, in an order continuous Banach lattice, every relative weakly compact uo-Cauchy net is uo-convergent (Theorem [\ref=wcuc]). We also prove that, in KB-spaces, every norm bounded uo-Cauchy net is uo-convergent. This property actually characterizes KB-spaces among order continuous Banach lattices (Theorem  [\ref=cha]).

The second part of our study, Section 5, is devoted to an application of uo-convergence to the theory of martingales without probability. In this theory, martingales are defined in vector and Banach lattices, with respect to a sequence of positive projections that play the role of filtration. To our knowledge, this theory was initiated by DeMarr [\cite=dem66], in which it is proved that, under certain natural conditions on the filtration, order bounded submartingales are order convergent. However, as stated in [\cite=dem66], their main theorem does not include Doob's almost sure convergence theorem as a special case. Since then, other efforts have been made to this problem. See, for example, [\cite=tro11] [\cite=koro08] [\cite=kuo04] [\cite=kuo05] [\cite=kuo06] [\cite=sto] [\cite=tro05] [\cite=uhl71]. In particular, in [\cite=kuo05] a new type of natural conditions on the filtration was introduced. It is under these conditions that we establish a version of Doob's almost sure convergence theorem for vector lattices in terms of uo-Cauchy sequences (Theorem  [\ref=pcon1]). In particular, we prove that, if the space is a KB-space then every normed bounded submartingale is uo-convergent (Proposition  [\ref=nconf]). These results include the classical Doob's theorem as a special case. In addition, we establish some results on norm convergence of submartingales in Banach lattices (Theorems [\ref=partial] and [\ref=acon1]). It deserves mentioning that our results apply to Banach lattice valued submartingales. Precisely, we prove that every norm bounded submartingale in L1(Ω;F) with respect to classical filtrations is almost surely uo-Cauchy in F, where F is an order continuous Banach lattice with a weak unit (Corollary  [\ref=vmart]) .

Preliminaries

Some basic definitions

We adopt [\cite=abr] [\cite=ali] [\cite=mn1991] as standard references for basic notions on Banach spaces, Banach lattices and vector lattices. Recall that a vector lattice is said to be order complete (respectively, σ-order complete) if every order bounded above subset (respectively, countable subset) has a supremum. It is easily seen that an order bounded net (xα) in an order complete vector lattice X order converges to x∈X if and only if [formula]. Recall also that in a vector lattice, a positive vector x0 > 0 is called a weak unit if [formula] for all x  ≥  0, and that in a normed lattice, a positive vector x0 > 0 is called a quasi-interior point if [formula] in norm for all x  ≥  0. Quasi-interior points are weak units. A positive functional on a vector lattice is said to be strictly positive if it does not vanish on non-zero positive vectors, and is said to be order continuous if it maps order null nets to order null nets.

A Banach lattice is said to be order continuous or have order continuous norm if every order null net is norm null, is said to be a KB-space if every norm bounded increasing sequence converges in norm, and is said to be an AL-space if [formula] for all [formula]. It is well-known that KB-spaces are order continuous and that AL-spaces are KB-spaces. We also need the following facts. In order continuous spaces, weak units are quasi-interior points. In KB-spaces, norm bounded increasing nets are norm convergent. Moreover, a Banach lattice is a KB-space iff it contains no lattice copies of c0 iff it is a band of its second dual (cf. [\cite=ali]). Kakutani's representation theorem (cf. [\cite=ali]) says that every AL-space is lattice isometric to L1(μ) for some measure μ. If, in addition, the AL-space has a weak unit x0, then μ can be chosen finite with x0 corresponding to the constant one function (cf. the proof of [\cite=ali]).

In a Banach lattice X, a subset A is said to be almost order bounded if for any ε > 0 there exists u∈X+ such that A  ⊂  [ -  u,u]  +  εBX. One should observe the following useful fact, which can be easily verified using Riesz decomposition theorem, that A  ⊂  [ -  u,u]  +  εBX iff [formula]. Relatively compact subsets (in particular, norm convergent sequences) are easily seen to be almost order bounded. Almost order bounded subsets in order continuous Banach lattices are relatively weakly compact (cf. [\cite=ali]). The classical Dunford-Pettis theorem asserts that in L1(μ), a subset is relatively weakly compact iff it is almost order bounded (apply e.g. [\cite=ali] with the functional being integration), iff it is norm bounded and uniformly integrable when μ is finite (cf. [\cite=kalton]).

A representation theorem

A fundamental tool used in this paper is the following standard representation theorem of vector lattices. We refer the reader to [\cite=mn1991] for specific details.

Throughout this subsection, let X stand for an order complete vector lattice with a strictly positive order continuous functional x*0 > 0. It is clear that the norm completion [formula] of X with respect to the norm

[formula]

is an AL-space. By [\cite=mn1991], X is an ideal of [formula]. It is easily seen that X is norm dense, and thus is order dense, in [formula].

Let x0 be a weak unit of X. Then [formula] is lattice isometric to L1(μ) for some finite measure μ with x0 corresponding to the constant 1 function.

In view of Kakutani's representation theorem, it suffices to show that x0 is also a weak unit of [formula]. Indeed, the band generated by x0 in [formula] clearly contains X, and hence is equal to [formula].

It is critical for us to know how uo-convergence in X passes to [formula] and also how weak convergence passes when X is a normed lattice. The following is immediate by Lemma [\ref=uo-ideal] (see below).

For (xα)  ⊂  X and x∈X, [formula] in X iff [formula] in [formula].

It follows that, for a sequence (xn)  ⊂  X and x∈X, [formula] in X iff [formula] in [formula] iff xn  →  x almost everywhere in [formula].

If X is normed and x*0 is norm continuous then X embeds continuously into [formula]. Thus, the following is immediate.

Let X be a normed lattice and x*0 be norm continuous.

For (xα)  ⊂  X and x∈X, if [formula] in X, then [formula] in [formula].

If A  ⊂  X is weakly compact in X, then A is also weakly compact in [formula].

We end this section with a simple result on extensions of positive operators.

For any positive operator T on X, if T*x*0 = x*0, then T extends uniquely to a contractive positive operator on [formula].

Indeed, for any x∈X, [formula]. Hence, T extends uniquely to a contractive positive operator [formula].

Unbounded Order Convergence

Some basic properties

Note that the uo-limit is unique whenever it exists. Note also that, for order bounded nets, uo-convergence is equivalent to o-convergence. We now provide some basic properties of uo-convergent nets that will be used in the sequel. We include the proofs of the first two lemmas for the sake of completeness.

Suppose [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula] for any [formula].

[formula] iff [formula]. In this case, [formula].

Suppose [formula] and [formula]. Then 0  ≤  x  ≤  y.

[\eqref=comp0] is trivial. [\eqref=comp1] follows from [formula] and [formula]. For [\eqref=comp2], note that [formula] by [\eqref=comp1]. Thus, [formula], by uniqueness of uo-limits. Since [formula], we have y  ≥  x.

Let X be an order complete vector lattice with a weak unit x0. Then [formula] iff [formula].

The "only if" part is obvious. We prove the "if" part. Pick any y  ≥  0. Since X is order complete, we have that

[formula]

Thus, x0 being a weak unit implies [formula], and [formula].

For the next two lemmas, observe the following fact. Let X be a vector lattice, I an ideal of X and (xα)  ⊂  I. If [formula] in I, then [formula] in X. Conversely, if (xα) is order bounded in I and [formula] in X, then [formula] in I.

Let B be a projection band and P the corresponding band projection. If [formula] in X then [formula] in both X and B.

Note that P is a lattice homomorphism and 0  ≤  P  ≤  I. Since [formula], it is easily seen that [formula] in X. In particular, for any y∈B+, [formula] in X, and thus in B, by the preceding remark. Hence, [formula] in B.

Let X be an order complete vector lattice and I an ideal of X. For (xα)  ⊂  I, [formula] in I iff [formula] in X.

The "if" part. Suppose [formula] in X. Then for any y∈I+, [formula] in X. The preceding remark implies [formula] in I. Therefore, [formula] in I.

The "only if" part. Suppose [formula] in I. Pick any y∈I+. Then [formula] in I, and thus in X, by the preceding remark again. It follows that, for any y∈I+ and any 0  ≤  z∈Id, [formula] in X.

Now for any w∈X+ and any [formula], we have [formula]. Thus by the preceding paragraph, [formula] in X, or equivalently,

[formula]

Observe that [formula] by [\cite=ali]. Therefore, we have, due to arbitrariness of u,

[formula]

It follows that [formula] in X. Hence, [formula] in X.

In Lemmas [\ref=uoc] and [\ref=uo-ideal], it suffices to assume X is σ-order complete if we only consider nets with countable index sets (in particular, sequences).

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice. Suppose [formula]. Then [formula].

Clearly, [formula]. Thus [formula]. It follows that [formula].

Norm convergence of uo-convergent nets

Recall that a subset in L1(μ) is relatively weakly compact iff it is almost order bounded (the classical Dunford-Pettis theorem), and iff it is norm bounded and uniformly integrable when μ is finite. Recall also that, when μ is finite, a uniformly integrable, almost everywhere convergent sequence in L1(μ) converge in norm. In view of this, the following results may be viewed as Abstract Dominated Theorem.

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice. If (xα) is almost order bounded and uo-converges to x, then xα converges to x in norm.

Note that the net [formula] is also almost order bounded. Fix any ε > 0. Then there exists u > 0 such that, for all α,

[formula]

Since [formula] converges to 0 in order of X, we know

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=ineq1] and [\eqref=ineq2], we have xα  →  x in norm.

We need the following lemma, which is a special case of [\cite=ali]. For the convenience of the reader, we provide a short proof of it based on the classical Dunford-Pettis Theorem; it also illustrates the power of the representation technique from Subsection 2.2.

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice. Let A be a relatively weakly compact subset of X. Then for any ε > 0 and x*∈X*+, there exists u∈X+ such that [formula].

Assume first that x* is strictly positive. Since X is order continuous, X is order complete and x* is order continuous. Let [formula] be the AL-space constructed for the pair (X,x*) as in Subsection [\ref=AL-rep]. By Lemma [\ref=al-wcon], A is relatively weakly compact in the AL-space [formula], and thus is almost order bounded in [formula] by Dunford-Pettis theorem. Therefore, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Since X is dense in [formula], there exists u∈X such that

[formula]

It follows from [formula] that [formula].

The general case. Put [formula] and Cx* = Ndx*. Then they are both bands of X and are order continuous Banach lattices in their own right. Note that [formula]. Let P be the band projection onto Cx*. Clearly, P(A) is relatively weakly compact in Cx* and x* is strictly positive on Cx*. Thus, by the preceding case, there exists u∈Cx* such that [formula]. It follows from [formula] and [formula] that [formula].

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice. If (xα) is relatively weakly compact and uo-converges to x, then xα converges to x in [formula].

Pick any x*∈X*+ and ε > 0. By Lemma [\ref=aobgeneral], there exists u∈X+ such that, for all α,

[formula]

Since [formula] and x* is order continuous, we have

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=ineq3] and [\eqref=ineq4], we have [formula].

Note that, in general, we cannot replace almost order boundedness by weak compactness in Proposition [\ref=ncon], or equivalently, we can not expect norm convergence in Proposition [\ref=abs-con]. Indeed, let (en) be the standard basis of [formula] or c0, then en weakly and uo-converges to 0, but [formula] for all n.

We now characterize the spaces where we can expect norm convergence. Recall that a Banach lattice X is said to have the positive Schur property if [formula] whenever [formula] in X. It is easily seen that the standard basis of c0 is positive, weakly null, but not norm null. Thus, any Banach lattice with the positive Schur property cannot contain lattice copies of c0, and therefore, is a KB-space. In particular, it is order continuous.

Let X be a σ-order complete Banach lattice. The following are equivalent:

X has the positive Schur property;

for every relatively weakly compact net (xα)  ⊂  X, [formula] implies [formula];

for any sequence (xn)  ⊂  X and x∈X, [formula] implies [formula];

for any relatively weakly compact net (xα)  ⊂  X and x∈X, [formula] implies [formula];

for any sequence (xn)  ⊂  X, [formula] implies [formula];

for any relatively weakly compact net (xα), [formula] implies [formula];

We first establish the equivalence of [\eqref=psp1], [\eqref=psp3] and [\eqref=psp5]. The implications [\eqref=psp1]⇒  [\eqref=psp5] and [\eqref=psp3]⇒  [\eqref=psp5] are obvious.

Suppose [\eqref=psp5] holds. We first show that X is an order continuous Banach lattice. Indeed, take any disjoint order bounded sequence (xn). Suppose [formula] for all n. For any x*∈X*+, we have [formula] for all n. Thus [formula] converges. In particular, [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Now we claim [formula]. Since X is σ-order complete, it suffices to prove [formula]. Suppose 0  ≤  u  ≤  yn for all n. Then [formula] for all n  ≥  2. It follows that [formula]. This proves the claim. Therefore, [formula] by the assumption [\eqref=psp5]. Hence, X is order continuous (cf. [\cite=ali]).

[\eqref=psp5]⇒  [\eqref=psp1] Suppose [formula] but [formula]. By passing to a subsequence, we may assume [formula]. Let B be the band generated by (xn). Since X is order continuous, so is B. Thus, B having a weak unit implies that it has a strictly positive functional x*0 > 0 (cf. [\cite=ali]). Let [formula] be the AL-space constructed for the pair (B,x*0) as in Subsection [\ref=AL-rep]. Then [formula]. Therefore, (xn) has a subsequence (xnk) which converges in order to 0 in [formula]. In particular, [formula] in [formula], hence in B by Lemma [\ref=uo-equiv], and in X by Lemma [\ref=uo-ideal]. By the assumption [\eqref=psp5], we have [formula], a contradiction.

[\eqref=psp5]⇒  [\eqref=psp3] Note that X is order continuous. Take any [formula]. Since (xn) is relatively weakly compact, we have [formula] by Proposition [\ref=abs-con]. Thus it follows from [formula] and the assumption [\eqref=psp5] that [formula].

[\eqref=psp1]⇒  [\eqref=psp2] Suppose (xα) is relatively weakly compact and [formula]. Suppose also xα does not converge to 0 in norm. Then there exists ε > 0 such that for any α, there exists β(α)  ≥  α satisfying [formula]. Thus, by passing to the subnet (xβ(α)), we may assume [formula]. Since [formula], there exists a sequence (yn)∞1  ⊂  {xα:α} such that [formula], by [\cite=fab2001]. The positive Schur property now implies [formula], a contradiction.

[\eqref=psp2]⇒  [\eqref=psp4] The assumption [\eqref=psp2] clearly implies X has the Schur property, hence X is a KB-space. Now suppose (xα) is relatively weakly compact and [formula]. Then [formula] by Proposition [\ref=abs-con]. By [\cite=ali], [formula] is also relatively weakly compact. Therefore, it follows from the assumption [\eqref=psp2] that [formula].

The implications [\eqref=psp4]⇒  [\eqref=psp6]⇒  [\eqref=psp5] are obvious.

Dunford-Pettis theorem in Banach lattices

We end this section with a known characterization of order continuous Banach lattices in which the Dunford-Pettis theorem holds, namely, every relatively weakly compact subset is almost order bounded. It follows from [\cite=wnuk] (cf. [\cite=chen]) and [\cite=mn1991]. We give an alternative proof using uo-convergence.

Let X be a Banach lattice with the positive Schur property. Suppose that X has a weak unit x0. Then every relatively weakly compact subset of X is almost order bounded.

Let A  ⊂  X be relatively weakly compact. We claim that, [formula],

[formula]

Indeed, since X has the positive Schur property, it is order continuous. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=aobgeneral], for any x* > 0 and any ε > 0, there exists u∈X+ such that [formula]. Since x0 is a weak unit of X, there exists n0 such that [formula] for all n  ≥  n0. It follows that [formula] for all n  ≥  n0. Hence, [formula] for all n  ≥  n0. Therefore, [formula].

We now show that, for any ε > 0, there exists n such that [formula]. Suppose not. Then there exists ε > 0 such that for any n  ≥  1 there exists xn∈A with [formula]. But we have, by [\eqref=unif], [formula]. Thus, [formula] by the positive Schur property, a contradiction.

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice. The following are equivalent:

X has the positive Schur property;

every relatively weakly compact countable subset of X is almost order bounded;

every relatively weakly compact subset of X is almost order bounded.

[\eqref=spsp1]⇒  [\eqref=spsp3] Let {yγ:γ∈Γ} be a maximal collection of pairwise disjoint elements of X. Let Δ be the collection of all finite subsets of Γ directed by inclusion. For each [formula], the band Bδ generated by {yγi}n1 is an order continuous Banach lattice with the positive Schur property and has a weak unit [formula]. Let Pδ be the band projection onto Bδ. Observe that [formula] for all x∈X+. Indeed, for any x∈X+, (Pδx) is increasing and norm bounded. Since X is a KB-space, (Pδx) is norm convergent. Thus, for each γ∈Γ, we have [formula]. Now maximality of [formula] implies x =  lim Pδx. This proves the observation.

Let A be relatively weakly compact. We first show that

[formula]

Suppose, otherwise, [formula]. Then for each δ, there exists xδ∈A such that [formula]. Consider the net [formula]. We claim that [formula]. Indeed, for any y∈X+, we have [formula]. This proves the claim. Note also that, as a subset of the solid hull of A, [formula] is also relatively weakly compact by [\cite=ali]. Therefore, [formula] by Theorem [\ref=psp][\eqref=psp6], a contradiction. This completes the proof of [\eqref=dont].

Therefore, for any ε > 0, we can find δ such that

[formula]

By [\cite=ali] again, [formula] is relatively weakly compact in X, and hence in Bδ. Since Bδ has the positive Schur property and a weak unit, by Lemma [\ref=wc-aob], there exists 0 < u∈Bδ such that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=nnnn1] and [\eqref=nnnn2], one gets [formula]. Hence, A is almost order bounded.

The implication [\eqref=spsp3]⇒  [\eqref=spsp2] is obvious. We now prove [\eqref=spsp2]⇒  [\eqref=spsp1]. Take any sequence (xn) with [formula]. Then (xn) is relatively weakly compact, and therefore, almost order bounded by assumption. Proposition [\ref=ncon] implies [formula]. Hence, X has the positive Schur property by Theorem [\ref=psp][\eqref=psp5].

Unbounded Order Cauchy

In view of the fact that the almost everywhere limit of a sequence in L1 may not belong to L1, we introduce the following notion. In a vector lattice X, a net (xα) is said to be unbounded order Cauchy (or, uo-Cauchy for short), if the net (xα - xα')(α,α') uo-converges to 0.

It is easily seen that, for order bounded nets, uo-Cauchy is equivalent to o-Cauchy, and therefore, in order complete lattices, is equivalent to o-convergence.

One can also easily see that, in c0 or [formula], uo-Cauchy of nets is the same as coordinate-wise Cauchy, and that, in Lp(μ)(1  ≤  p <   ∞  ), uo-Cauchy of sequences is the same as almost everywhere Cauchy.

Note that every uo-convergent net is uo-Cauchy. In the rest of this subsection, we provide some sufficient conditions to yield uo-convergence of uo-Cauchy nets. The following are two obvious cases.

If a uo-Cauchy net (xα) has a uo-convergent subnet whose uo-limit is x, then [formula]. The proof is straightforward verification.

A norm convergent uo-Cauchy net uo-converges to its norm limit. One can easily show this by using the continuity of lattice operations with respect to norm.

The following are consequences of Propositions [\ref=ncon] and [\ref=abs-con].

In an order continuous Banach lattice, every almost order bounded uo-Cauchy net converges uo- and in norm to the same limit.

Suppose (xα) is almost order bounded and uo-Cauchy. Then the net (xα - xα') is almost order bounded and is uo-convergent to 0. Thus, it converges to 0 in norm by Proposition [\ref=ncon]. It follows that the net (xα) is norm-Cauchy, and thus norm-convergent. Now apply Remark [\ref=trivial][\eqref=trivial2].

Let X be order continuous. Then every relatively weakly compact uo-Cauchy net converges uo- and [formula] to the same limit.

Suppose (xα) is relatively weakly compact and uo-Cauchy. Then it has a subnet (xβ) weakly convergent to some x∈X. In view of Proposition [\ref=abs-con], it suffices to prove [formula].

Assume first that X has a weak unit. Then X* has a strictly positive functional x*0 (cf. [\cite=ali]). Let [formula] be the AL-space constructed for the pair (X,x*0) as in Subsection [\ref=AL-rep]. By Lemma [\ref=al-wcon], (xα) is relatively weakly compact and thus almost order bounded in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=uo-equiv], (xα) is also uo-Cauchy in [formula]. Therefore, [formula] for some [formula] by Proposition [\ref=aobuc]. By Lemma [\ref=al-wcon] we have that [formula] in [formula], hence y = x. It follows that [formula] in [formula], and therefore, in X, by Lemma [\ref=uo-equiv] again.

The general case. Fix any y > 0. Let B be the band generated by y in X and P the band projection onto B. Then B is an order continuous Banach lattice with a weak unit. Clearly, (Pxα) is relatively weakly compact in B and [formula] in B. By Lemma [\ref=band-proj], (Pxα) is uo-Cauchy in B. Thus the preceding case implies [formula] in B. In particular, [formula] in B, and therefore, in X by the remark preceding Lemma [\ref=band-proj].

As in Remark [\ref=follow-ncon], we can not expect norm convergence in this theorem.

Note that, in general, we can not replace weak compactness with norm boundedness to obtain uo-convergence in this theorem. Indeed, let X = c0, and put [formula], where (en) is the standard basis. Then (xn) is uo-Cauchy and norm bounded, but it is not uo-convergent in c0.

In fact, the following theorem shows that c0 is the only case that we need to avoid. We need the following sublattice version of Lemma [\ref=uo-ideal].

Let X be an order complete Banach lattice and Y a closed sublattice of X. Suppose Y is order continuous in its own right.

For every order bounded above subset of Y, its supremum in Y equals its supremum in X.

For an order bounded net (xα)  ⊂  Y, [formula] in Y iff [formula] in X.

For any net (xα)  ⊂  Y, [formula] in Y iff [formula] in X.

For [\eqref=c0-case1], without loss of generality, assume A = (xα)  ⊂  Y with [formula]. Let x be its supremum in Y. Then by order continuity of Y, xα  →  x in norm of Y, and thus in norm of X. Since xα is increasing, x is its supremum in X.

[\eqref=c0-case2] Suppose [formula] in Y. Since Y is order complete, the net (yα)  ⊂  Y, where [formula], is well defined and decreases to 0 in Y. By [\eqref=c0-case1], [formula] in X. Since [formula], we have [formula] in X. Conversely, suppose [formula] in X. Since X is order complete, the net [formula] is well defined and decreases to 0 in X. By [\eqref=c0-case1], yα∈Y. It is clear that [formula] in Y, thus [formula] in Y.

[\eqref=c0-case3] Suppose [formula] in X. Then for any 0 < y∈Y, [formula] in X, and thus in Y, by [\eqref=c0-case2]. It follows that [formula] in Y. Conversely, suppose now [formula] in Y. Let I be the ideal generated by Y in X. Take any x∈I+. Then x  ≤  y for some y∈Y+. Note that [formula] in Y, and thus in X by [\eqref=c0-case2], and in I by the remark preceding Lemma [\ref=band-proj]. Therefore, [formula] in I, and thus in X by Lemma [\ref=uo-ideal].

It is enough to assume X is σ-order complete in Lemma [\ref=c0-case], if we only consider countable sets and nets with countable index sets.

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice. The following are equivalent:

X is a KB-space;

every norm bounded uo-Cauchy net in X is uo-convergent;

every norm bounded uo-Cauchy sequence in X is uo-convergent.

[\eqref=cha2]⇒  [\eqref=cha3] is obvious. We now prove [\eqref=cha3]⇒  [\eqref=cha1]. Assume [\eqref=cha3] holds but X is not a KB-space. Then X contains a lattice copy of c0. Without loss of generality, we assume c0  ⊂  X. Recall from Remark [\ref=c0exa] that [formula] is uo-Cauchy in c0 but not uo-convergent in c0 and it satisfies [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=c0-case][\eqref=c0-case3], (xn) is also uo-Cauchy in X, and thus uo-converges to some x∈X+ by assumption [\eqref=cha3]. Let u be a weak unit of c0, B the band generated by u in X and PB the corresponding band projection. Then by Lemma  [\ref=band-proj], we have that [formula] in X, thus x = PBx. Moreover, we have, for all k  ≥  1, [formula] in order of X, hence [formula] converges to [formula] in norm of X by order continuity of X. Since [formula], we have [formula] for all k  ≥  1, and therefore, [formula] by order continuity of X again. Hence, by Lemma [\ref=c0-case][\eqref=c0-case3], we have that xn uo-converges in c0 to x∈c0, a contradiction.

[\eqref=cha1]⇒  [\eqref=cha2]. Suppose that (xα) is uo-Cauchy and norm bounded. From [formula], we know that (x±α) are both uo-Cauchy. Thus, without loss of generality, we assume that the net (xα) consists of positive elements (cf. Lemma [\ref=comparison]).

Assume first that X has a weak unit x0. Fix [formula]. Note that [formula]. Hence, [formula] is order Cauchy. Since it is order bounded, it converges in order (and thus in norm) to some yk∈X. It is clear that [formula]. Note also that {yk}k is increasing. Thus yk converges to some y∈X.

It remains to prove [formula], or equivalently, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=uoc]. Put [formula]. Then by assumption, [formula]. Now for any k  ≥  1, we have

[formula]

Taking limit in β', we have, by the continuity of lattice operations with respect to norm, for any β  ≥  α,

[formula]

Now letting k  →    ∞   and using continuity of lattice operations again, we have

[formula]

from which it follows that [formula].

The general case. Let Bδ and Pδ be as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=spsp]. Then each Bδ is a KB-space with a weak unit. Since X is order continuous, we have that, for each x∈X, Pδx  →  x in norm. By Lemma [\ref=band-proj], (Pδxα) is uo-Cauchy in Bδ. The preceding case implies that there exists 0  ≤  zδ∈Bδ such that [formula] in Bδ, and hence in X, by Lemma [\ref=uo-ideal]. Note that the net (zδ) is increasing by Lemma [\ref=comparison] and [formula] by Lemma [\ref=norm]. Thus it converges to some 0  ≤  x∈X.

It remains to show that [formula]. Pick any y∈X+. Let Py be the band projection onto By. Then a similar argument as before shows that Pyxα uo-converges to some 0  ≤  y0∈By in X. We have

[formula]

Thus for any δ, [formula] in X. Recall that [formula] in X. Thus, [formula] in X. We have

[formula]

Since lim Pδy0 = y0 and lim zδ = x, taking limit in δ in [\eqref=mid-cite], we have [formula]. It follows that y0 = Pyx and [formula] in X by ([\ref=eq00]).

In the classical L1 case, Fatou's lemma says that, if fn converges almost everywhere to a measurable function f, then [formula]. In particular, if {fn} is bounded, then f∈L1. In view of this, the preceding theorem may be viewed as Abstract Fatou Lemma (cf. Lemma [\ref=norm]).

We can not replace order continuity of X with order completeness in the assumption of this theorem. Indeed, it is easily seen that in [formula], every norm bounded uo-Cauchy net is also order Cauchy, and thus is order convergent, since [formula] is order complete. Nevertheless, [formula] is not a KB-space.

Suppose that X is an order continuous Banach lattice which is realized as a Köthe space within some L1(μ) space. Theorem [\ref=cha] says, in particular, that X is a KB-space iff given any bounded sequence (xn) in X which converges a.e. to some measurable function x, then x∈X. This gives a nice characterization of KB-spaces among order continuous Köthe spaces in terms of almost everywhere convergence.

We mention here that many results in this section and the previous one can be easily extended to unbounded norm convergence. We say that a net (xα) is unbounded norm convergent to x if [formula] for all y∈X+. This type of convergence is introduced in [\cite=tro04] and is an analogue of convergence in measure in L1(μ) spaces.

Convergence of Submartingales

The classical Doob's (sub-)martingale convergence theorem in a probability L1(μ)-space is as follows (cf. [\cite=chu74]).

Every norm bounded submartingale in L1(μ) converges almost surely.

In this section, we extend it to a measure-free setting. We refer the reader to [\cite=chu74] [\cite=meyer] for Doob's classical theorems and to [\cite=dem66] [\cite=tro11] [\cite=koro08] [\cite=kuo04] [\cite=kuo05] [\cite=kuo06] [\cite=sto] [\cite=tro05] [\cite=uhl71] for various efforts of measure-free extensions in the history.

Let's recall some basic definitions. Let X be a vector lattice. A filtration (En) on X is a sequence of positive projections on X such that [formula] for all m,n  ≥  1. We say that the filtration (En) is bounded if X is a Banach lattice and [formula]. Recall also that a sequence (xn)  ⊂  X is called a martingale relative to the filtration (En) if Enxm = xn for all m  ≥  n, and a sequence (zn)  ⊂  X is called a submartingale relative to (En) if [formula] and Enzm  ≥  zn for all m  ≥  n.

Abstract bistochastic filtrations

In view of [\cite=abr], we say that a filtration (En) on a vector lattice X is abstract bistochastic if there exist a weak unit x0 > 0 in X and a strictly positive order continuous functional x*0 > 0 on X such that the following double condition is satisfied by E1 (and hence by all En's):

[formula]

To our knowledge, these conditions were first considered in the setting of abstract martingales by [\cite=kuo05] under the terminology of expectation operators (see [\cite=kuo05]).

Note that the classical filtrations on Banach lattice valued L1(Ω;F)-spaces are abstract bistochastic. Details are as follows. We refer the reader to [\cite=DU77] [\cite=Egg84] for unexplained terminology.

Let [formula] be a probability space and F a Banach lattice. Then X: = L1(Ω,F) is a Banach lattice. Moreover, X is an order continuous Banach lattice (respectively, a KB-space) if so is F. For our purpose, we always assume F is order continuous and has a weak unit x0. Then F has a strictly positive functional x*0 > 0. Define the constant function f0(ω) = x0 and the constant functional g0(w) = x*0 for each ω∈Ω. It is straightforward to verify that f0 is a weak unit in X and g0 is a strictly positive functional on X.

Let [formula] be a sub-σ-field of [formula] and [formula] the classical conditional expectation defined on X relative to [formula]. Then E is a positive projection on X. Since E preserves the constant functions(cf. [\cite=Egg84]), we have Ef0 = f0. Moreover, for each x∈X, we have

[formula]

It follows that E*g0 = g0.

Let's also observe the following well-known simple facts concerning the condition [formula]. We provide the proofs for the sake of completeness.

Let X be a vector lattice with a strictly positive order continuous functional x*0 > 0 and E a positive projection on X. The following are equivalent:

E*x* = x* for some strictly positive order continuous functional x* > 0;

E is strictly positive and order continuous.

[\eqref=double11]⇒  [\eqref=double12] Suppose Ex = 0 for x  ≥  0. Then x*(x) = (E*x*)(x) = x*(Ex) = 0. Thus, x = 0 due to strict positivity of x*. This proves E is strictly positive. Now suppose [formula] and Exα  ≥  z  ≥  0 for all α. Then [formula] by order continuity of x*. It follows that x*(z) = 0, and thus z = 0. Hence, [formula], and E is order continuous.

[\eqref=double12]⇒  [\eqref=double11] Simply put x* = E*x*0. It is straightforward to verify that x* is strictly positive and order continuous and E*x* = x*.

Let X be a normed lattice with a quasi-interior point x0 > 0 and E a positive projection on X. The following are equivalent:

Ex = x for some quasi-interior point x > 0;

E* is strictly positive.

[\eqref=double21]⇒  [\eqref=double22] Suppose E*x* = 0 for some x*  ≥  0. Then x*(x) = x*(Ex) = (E*x*)(x) = 0. Since x is a quasi-interior point, x* = 0. Thus, E* is strictly positive. [\eqref=double22]⇒  [\eqref=double21] Put x = Ex0. Clearly, Ex = x. It remains to prove x is a quasi-interior point. Indeed, take x* > 0, then E*x* > 0. Thus x*(x) = x*(Ex0) = E*x*(x0) > 0. It follows that x is a quasi-interior point by [\cite=ali].

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice with a weak unit and (En) a filtration on X. Then (En) is abstract bistochastic iff E1 and E*1 are both strictly positive iff En and E*n are both strictly positive for every n.

Observe that weak units in X are quasi-interior points, that X has a strictly positive functional (cf. [\cite=ali]), and that all positive operators on X are order continuous. Apply Lemmas [\ref=double1] and [\ref=double2].

Uo-convergence of submartingales

The following is a version of Doob's almost sure convergence theorem in vector lattices.

Let X be an order complete vector lattice and (En) an abstract bistochastic filtration on X. Let (zn) be a submartingale relative to (En). If sup nx*0(z+n) <   ∞   where x*0 is as in the double condition [formula], then (zn) is uo-Cauchy. In particular, if (zn) is order bounded, then (zn) is order convergent.

Let x0 be also as in the double condition [formula]. Without loss of generality, assume x*0(x0) = 1. Let [formula] be the AL-space constructed for the pair (X,x*0) as in Subsection [\ref=AL-rep]. Then by Lemma [\ref=representation], [formula] for some probability P with x0 corresponding to the constant 1 function.

By Lemma [\ref=ope], each En extends to a contractive positive operator [formula] on [formula]. Clearly, each [formula] is still a projection. Since [formula], we know, by Douglas' representation theorem([\cite=abr]), that each [formula] is a conditional expectation on L1(P). It follows that [formula] is a classical filtration on L1(P).

For any n  ≤  m, we have x*0(zn)  ≤  x*0(Enzm) = x*0(zm)  ≤  x*0(z+m). Hence, for all k, we have x*0(z1)  ≤  x*0(zk)  ≤   sup nx*0(z+n). It follows that [formula], and therefore, [formula], i.e. [formula]. We know, by Doob's Theorem [\ref=doob], that (zn) converges almost everywhere (to a function in [formula]). Therefore, (zn) is uo-Cauchy in [formula], and hence in X by Lemma [\ref=uo-equiv].

According to [\cite=cha64], every norm bounded martingale in L1(Ω;F) with respect to classical filtrations converges strongly almost surely for every probability space Ω iff F has the Radon-Nikodym property. Below we prove that even when F lacks the Radon-Nikodym property, norm bounded submartingales in L1(Ω;F) still have certain convergence property.

Let F be an order continuous Banach lattice with a weak unit. Then every norm bounded submartingale (zn) in L1(Ω;F) with respect to a classical filtration is almost surely uo-Cauchy in F (i.e. outside a subset of measure 0, zn(ω) is uo-Cauchy in F).

Let x0 and f0 be as in Remark [\ref=martin99]. By Remark [\ref=martin99] and Theorem [\ref=pcon1], we know that (zn) is uo-Cauchy in L1(Ω;F). Now observe that (zn) is uo-Cauchy in L1(Ω;F) iff (by Lemma [\ref=uoc]) [formula] in L1(Ω;F), iff [formula] in L1(Ω;F), iff outside a subset of measure 0, [formula] in F, iff outside a subset of measure 0, (zn(ω)) is uo-Cauchy in F.

Note that, in general, we can not expect uo-convergence in Theorem [\ref=pcon1].

Let X = c0 and put E1 to be the projection on c0 consisting of 2  ×  2 diagonal blocks . Define En by replacing the first (n - 1) diagonal blocks in E1 with the identity matrix. Then (En) is a (bounded) filtration on c0. Since both E1 and E*1 are strictly positive, (En) is abstract bistochastic, by Corollary [\ref=ocdouble]. For each n  ≥  1, put

[formula]

Then (xn) is a norm bounded martingale relative to (En). It is clear that (xn) is uo-Cauchy but not uo-convergent in c0.

The following Proposition [\ref=nconf] establishes uo-convergence of submartingales. For the proof of the proposition, we need the following critical observation which has appeared in [\cite=uhl71] and [\cite=tro05].

Let (En) be a filtration on a Banach lattice.

If (xn) is a martingale such that a subsequence (xnk) weakly converges to x, then xn = Enx for all n.

If (zn) is a submartingale such that a subsequence (znk) weakly converges to x, then zn  ≤  Enx for all n.

We prove [\eqref=weaksub2] only. Fix n. Then for sufficiently large k, we have zn  ≤  Enznk. Since [formula], the desired result follows.

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice and (En) an abstract bistochastic filtration on X. Let (zn) be a submartigale relative to (En).

If X is a KB-space and [formula], then (zn) is uo-convergent.

If a subsequence of (zn) converges weakly to x, then [formula].

[\eqref=nconf1] follows from Theorem [\ref=pcon1] and Theorem [\ref=cha]. For [\eqref=nconf2], suppose [formula]. Let x*0 be as in the double condition [formula]. Since zn  ≤  Enx by Lemma [\ref=weaksub], z+n  ≤  Enx+. Thus sup nx*0(z+n)  ≤   sup nx*0(Enx+) = x*0(x+) <   ∞  . It follows from Theorem [\ref=pcon1] that (zn) is uo-Cauchy. In particular, (znk) is also uo-Cauchy. Since (znk) is also relatively weakly compact, it uo-converges to x by Theorem [\ref=wcuc]. Therefore, (zn) uo-converges to x, by Remark [\ref=trivial][\eqref=trivial1].

Norm convergence of submartingales

In the classical case, we have the following norm convergence theorems for (sub-)martingales(cf.  [\cite=chu74], [\cite=meyer]).

In L1(μ), if (zn) is a relatively weakly compact submartingale then (zn) converges in norm.

In Lp(μ)(1  ≤  p  <    ∞  ), every relatively weakly compact martingale converges in norm.

In Lp(μ)(1  <  p  <    ∞  ), if (zn) is a norm bounded submartingale then (z+n) converges in norm.

We now extend these results to abstract (sub-)martingales. The following is immediate by Proposition [\ref=aobuc], Theorems [\ref=wcuc] and [\ref=pcon1], and extends Theorem [\ref=n-con][\eqref=n-con1].

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice and (En) an abstract bistochastic filtration on X. Let (zn) be a submartigale relative to (En).

If (zn) is almost order bounded, then (zn) converges uo- and in norm to the same limit.

If (zn) is relatively weakly compact, then (zn) converges uo- and [formula] to the same limit.

The next result extends Theorem [\ref=n-con][\eqref=n-con2] and [\eqref=n-con3].

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice and (En) a bounded abstract bistochastic filtration on X.

For any martingale (xn) relative to (En), if a subsequence (xnk) weakly converges to x, then (xn) converges uo- and in norm to x;

For any submartingale (zn) relative to (En), if a subsequence (znk) weakly converges to x, then (z+n) converges uo- and in norm to x+.

For [\eqref=partial1], suppose [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=nconf], we know xn uo-converges to x. By Lemma [\ref=weaksub], we have xn = Enx for n  ≥  1. Put [formula]. Then [formula], and thus xn = Enx  →  x (this is true for all y∈M, and thus is also true for [formula] due to the boundedness of (En)).

For [\eqref=partial2], we apply Proposition [\ref=helpful]. Let [formula], then [formula]. Since the range of each En is a sublattice of X ([\cite=abr]), so is [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Thus (Enx+) is norm convergent, and in particular, is almost order bounded. Since zn  ≤  Enx by Lemma [\ref=weaksub], we have z+n  ≤  Enx+ for all n, implying that (z+n) is also almost order bounded. Moreover, it is straightforward to verify that (z+n) is a submartingale relative to (En). Therefore, (z+n) converges uo- and in norm to the same limit, by Proposition [\ref=helpful]. By Proposition [\ref=nconf], zn uo-converges to x. Hence, the uo-limit of z+n is x+.

The norm convergence in Theorem [\ref=partial][\eqref=partial1] and its proof are due to Uhl [\cite=uhl71] and [\cite=tro05]. We give here a direct proof of the norm convergence in Theorem [\ref=partial][\eqref=partial2]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=weaksub] that zn  ≤  Enx for each [formula]. Thus [formula], since [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Since [formula] by Proposition [\ref=nconf] , we have that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. It follows that

[formula]

Combining the above, we get [formula].

We have used the fact that if [formula] then (Enx) converges in norm. This is actually true for arbitrary x∈X if the filtration is bounded and abstract bistochastic; see [\cite=meyer] for the classical case.

Let X be an order continuous Banach lattice and (En) a bounded abstract bistochastic filtration. Then for any x∈X, (Enx) converges uo- and in norm to the same limit.

Let x0 be as in the double condition [formula]. Put [formula]. Without loss of generality, assume x > 0. For any ε > 0, take k0 such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

Since [formula], we have {Enx}  ⊂  [0,k0x0] + CεBX. It follows that (Enx) is almost order bounded. Thus it converges uo- and in norm to the same limit by Proposition [\ref=helpful].
