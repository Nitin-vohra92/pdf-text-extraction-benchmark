Volatility in options formulae for general stochastic dynamics

Introduction

The goal of the paper is to examine the compatibility between the Black-Scholes formula and stock price models with non-constant volatility. Our investigation has a much more general setup than that of the Black-Scholes model encompassing a class of diffusion models for stock prices.

The Black-Scholes option pricing formula (published 40 years ago) is based on the Black-Scholes stock price model,

[formula]

where Wt is a Brownian motion and σ, known as the spot volatility, is assumed constant. Here by the price of an option at time t with strike K under the model Zt, 0  ≤  t  ≤  T, we understand the expression

[formula]

where r is the riskless interest rate and T is the option maturity, t  ≤  T.

The Black-Scholes implied volatility is defined as such value of the volatility parameter σ that, when plugged into the Black-Scholes formula C(T,t,K,σ,z), gives the observed market price, i.e. that value of σ that makes the observed and the theoretical option price (or model price) coincide.

Empirical studies have shown that the Black-Scholes implied volatility varies with both strike prices K and maturities T. This is called the smile effect, and contradicts the constant volatility assumption. This fact, however, has not diminished the popularity of the Black-Scholes formula. Option prices are often quoted in terms of the Black-Scholes implied volatilities, making the Black-Scholes formula, a convenient communication tool in the industry.

Finding a stock price model which is compatible with the Black-Scholes formula is of tremendous interest to the finance industry and has become the impetus for the development of the modeling of the Black-Scholes implied volatility.

In this paper our approach differs from that of other implied volatility modeling work in one significant way: we do not place any assumptions on the general dynamics of the stock price process, spot volatility process or how they are related.

Our research builds upon the work of Hamza and Klebaner [\cite=HK2006], where it was shown that if option prices of an arbitrary stock price model are given by the Black-Scholes formula for a continuum of strike prices K (and three maturities), then the implied volatility must be constant. Under the additional assumption that the filtration of the price model is that of a Brownian motion, then the model must be the Black-Scholes model (see [\cite=HK2007]). In [\cite=HK2008] this conclusion was extended to the case when the implied volatility is also assumed to depend on the maturity date T.

Here we extend this non-existence result in two directions. Firstly, we consider a class of diffusion models much more general than the Black-Scholes model considered in [\cite=HK2006] and reach the same non-existence conclusion found therein. Secondly, and for the sake of practicality, we adopt the more realistic assumption that the option price formula (Black-Scholes or otherwise) only holds for finitely many strikes. In this case we arrive at the result that the implied volatility is not necessarily constant, but approaches a constant as the number of strike prices increases. More importantly, we show that the variation of the implied volatility process is bounded by a value that depends only on the strike prices and not on any of the model parameters. Our main result takes the form of a uniform bound on the variation of the implied volatility process, or rather on a large family of proxies thereof, and also provides us with a set of constraints limiting the acceptable (i.e. compatible with the option pricing formula) values of the stock price and implied volatility parameters; the more maturity times we have, the more refined this set of constraints would be.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the basic setup of the paper. In the following sections we state our results, first under the continuum of strikes assumption, then under the finitely many strikes assumption.

General setup

Throughout this paper, Z(σ)t will denote a reference process (eg the Black-Scholes model), or rather a family of processes indexed by a parameter σ (we call the volatility parameter), while St will stand for an unspecified process whose option price formula mimics those of Z(σ)t (a precise meaning is given later). The two processes may live on separate spaces and we let [formula] be the filtered probability space that supports St. As Z(σ)t will be assumed Markovian, any conditioning on the past reduces to a conditioning on the present, and therefore no reference will be made to the filtration (or for that matter the probability space) of Z(σ)t.

For simplicity, we assume that the riskless interest rate r = 0. Therefore, according to the First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing, a stock price model does not have arbitrage opportunities if and only if there exists an equivalent probability measure, known as a no-arbitrage measure, under which the stock price is a martingale. The price of an option is then simply the expectation, under the no-arbitrage measure, of the payoff function conditional on the past

[formula]

Throughout this paper we will invariably write [formula] for the expectations in the "Z-space" or the "S-space"; the precise meaning of the expectation being obvious from the context. For ease of exposition, we shall also often write Zt for Z(σ)t, occasionally reverting to the original notation to highlight the dependence on σ.

As eluded earlier, the process Z(σ)t will be assumed to be a diffusion whose diffusion coefficient contains the volatility parameter σ as a multiplicative factor:

[formula]

where B is a Brownian motion, h and β are deterministic functions such that [formula] and for any t, [formula].

We later comment on the reason for choosing a volatility function of the form h(t)β(z) rather than a more general b(t,z).

Throughout this paper we make the following two assumptions.

Diffusion Assumption (D): Stochastic differential equation [\eqref=sde] has a unique weak solution that takes values in in an open interval in

[formula]

C(T,t,K,σ,z) = = zΦ(η)-KΦ(η-σ),

[formula]

φ(z) = 2K(2),

[formula]

Pφ(z) = eφ(z),

[formula]

φ(t,z) = 0 and (t,z)φ(t,z) = h(t)φ(t,z).

[formula]

The case of a continuum of strikes

Here we consider the case of a continuum of strikes and show that non-constant volatility parameter models are not compatible with the option price formula [\eqref=maineq0]. More specifically, when the option price formula holds for a continuum of strikes (i.e. for any [formula]) and three maturity times, then the process θt must be constant (i.e. non-random and not dependent on t). The following theorem is a generalization to diffusion models of the main result in [\cite=HK2006].

Let St and θt be adapted processes such that θ0  =  σ and S0 = z0. Assume that St is non-negative and that there exist three terminal times, T1 < T2 < T3 such that, for all [formula] and all t  ≤  Ti, i = 1,2,3

[formula]

Then θ2t  =  σ2 for all t  ≤  T1.

Furthermore, if [formula] is the natural filtration of some Brownian motion, then [formula]. In other words Z is the only model on a Brownian filtration that is compatible with [\eqref=maineq].

The proof follows [\cite=HK2006] and is adapted to the general diffusion setup of Assumption (D) through the use of the function φ.

First we show that since Zt is a martingale so is St (at least up to T3). Indeed,

[formula]

Because

[formula]

we deduce that (recall that φ is convex and [formula])

[formula]

where the last equality follows from Assumption (M2). Thus for each i, [formula] is a true martingale (up to Ti). In other words, with

[formula]

the assumptions of the theorem imply the existence of three martingales of the form Mt, MtXt and MtXαt, where Xt is a semimartingale and

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=specmartg] below it follows that Xt = X0, which in turn proves that θ2t  =  θ20  =  σ2.

Now if [formula] is a Brownian filtration, then all martingales are continuous and, in view of [\eqref=ode] and the fact that θ2t  =  σ2,

[formula]

where t is a (continuous) local martingale. As all local martingales of finite variation must be constant, it follows that

[formula]

Let Mt and Xt be two semimartingales, Mt is positive. Assume that there exists α > 1 such that Mt, MtXt and MtXαt are local martingales. Then [formula].

The proof of Proposition [\ref=specmartg] is given in [\cite=HK2006] and is based on a convexity argument.

At this point, we stress that no assumptions are made on the dynamics of St or on the relationship between St and θt.

The case of finitely many strikes

We now only assume that [\eqref=maineq] holds true for a finite sequence of strike prices, [formula]. With this reduced assumption, it is no longer possible to conclude that θ2t is constant. We shall see that we can however obtain universal bounds on the amount of variation θt is allowed to have. These bounds are universal in the sense that they do not depend on St or θt, but only on Zt or more specifically on the function φ.

The practical implication of these bounds, as given in Theorem [\ref=mainth] and more specifically inequality [\eqref=bound], is a set of constraints limiting the range of possible values of the parameters that define St and θt. Indeed, for a given parametric model, the left-hand side of [\eqref=bound] can in principle be expressed as a function of those parameters, while the right-hand side only depends on φ. Inequality [\eqref=bound] can therefore be used as a tool in calibrating the model parameters.

Similar to the case of continuum of strikes we extract information about the implied volatility process θt through the process [formula]. In the former case we have shown that Xt = X0, implying that θt  =  θ0, but in the present case we only manage a bound on the variation of θ. The way we shall measure such a variation is via a function Q (a polynomial with possibly non-integer powers) associated with a sequence of terminal times, [formula] (q  ≥  3). Let

[formula]

Observe that α1 = 0, α2 = 1 and the sequence αk is increasing. Now, for any non-zero sequence [formula] of non-negative numbers, let

[formula]

Such a function is clearly convex on (0,  ∞  ) and, nil and minimum at x = X0. In particular [formula].

In the particular time-homogeneous ([formula]) unweighted ([formula]) case of equidistant times (Tk + 1 - Tk = T2 - T1), this function reduces to Q(x)  =  (x - X0)2P(x), for some polynomial P with positive coefficients.

Let, for a terminal time T and t  ≤  T,

[formula]

In the case of a continuum of strikes, we saw that the martingale Mt,T coincides with Nt,T. This fact plays a key role in establishing the non-existence result in continuum of strikes case. This non-existence result is no longer true in the case of finitely many strikes. Therefore our initial aim is precisely to compute the difference

[formula]

Let St be a non-negative adapted process. Assume that there exist a finite sequence of strike prices, [formula] such that, for all t  ≤  T,

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where [formula].

Since [formula],

[formula]

Therefore, using the identity

[formula]

we get

[formula]

that is,

[formula]

which completes the proof.

We are now ready to state the main result of this section. We shall rely on two facts:

Nt,T  +  Dt,T is a true martingale;

for a sequence of maturity times Ti, Nt,Tk = Nt,T1Xαkt, for some αk, and where as before

[formula]

Let St and θt be adapted processes such that θ0  =  σ and S0 = z0. Assume that St is non-negative and that there exist a sequence of terminal times, [formula] and a finite sequence of strike prices, [formula] such that, for all t  ≤  Ti,

[formula]

Then for any non-zero sequence [formula] of non-negative numbers, or equivalently for any function Q as defined in [\eqref=poly], and assuming that [formula],

[formula]

where Xt is given in [\eqref=Xt] and

[formula]

Since Nt,Tk = Nt,T1Xαkt and Nt,T  +  Dt,T  =  Mt,T,

[formula]

Further, labeling the various terms in [\eqref=DtT],

[formula]

so that Dt,T  =  Ht,T  -  Lt,T  -  Gt,T, and noting that Q(X0) = 0 and that both Mt,T and Ht,T are martingales (see [\cite=HJK2005] for a proof of the latter), we get,

[formula]

from which it follows that

[formula]

Now, noting that, for K∈(Kj,Kj + 1),

[formula]

we get that

[formula]

Recall that since φ is convex, [formula]. The result follows immediately.

We note that, since [formula] converges to 0 as Km  →    ∞  , by taking a large enough Km, we can make the term [formula] arbitrarily small so that the left-hand side of [\eqref=bound] essentially reduces to [formula], which in the time-homogeneous ([formula]) unweighted ([formula]) case of three equidistant times (T3 - T2 = T2 - T1), further reduces to [formula].

We stress here that we have complete freedom as to the choice of the non-zero sequence of non-negative numbers [formula], thus providing us with an infinite set of constraints.

Next we show that if the number of strike prices increases in the sense of [\eqref=strikes], then the bound in [\eqref=bound] vanishes. In other words, the implied volatility approaches a constant when the number of strike prices increases. The notations introduced in Theorem [\ref=mainth] will now carry an index n.

Let [formula] be a sequence of terminal times. Let, for each n, S(n)t and θ(n)t be adapted processes such that θ(n)0  =  σ and S(n)0 = z0. Assume that S(n)t is non-negative and that there exist a finite sequence of strike prices, [formula] such that, lim n  →    ∞K(n)m(n) =  +   ∞  ,

[formula]

and [\eqref=maineqfinite] holds true for all n, all j  ≤  m(n) and all t  ≤  Ti, then for all t  ≤  T1,

[formula]

First we observe that for any z and n large enough, (K(n)m(n),z) = 0 and that (K(n)m(n),ZT) is dominated by the integrable random variable φ(ZT). It follows, by dominated convergence, that [formula] approaches 0. Since the right-hand side of [\eqref=bound] clearly approaches 0, we immediately get that

[formula]

Since [formula], we deduce by Fatou's Lemma that lim inf nQ(X(n)t) = 0. We complete the proof by recalling that Q is convex and nil at X0.

Here a superscript (n) has been added whenever (St,θt) is replaced with (S(n)t,θ(n)t).

Let [formula] be a sequence of terminal times. Let, for each n, S(n)t and θ(n)t be adapted processes such that θ(n)0  =  σ and S(n)0 = z0. Assume that S(n)t is non-negative and that the sequence of processes θ(n)t is tight. Further assume that there exist a finite sequence of strike prices, [formula] such that, lim n  →    ∞K(n)m(n) =  +   ∞  ,

[formula]

and [\eqref=maineqfinite] holds true for all n, all j  ≤  m(n) and all t  ≤  Ti. Then for all t  ≤  T1,

[formula]

The result follows from Corollary [\ref=corconv] above. By Prohorov's Theorem, the sequence of processes θ(n)t is sequentially compact. As a result, applying Corollary [\ref=corconv] to any convergent subsequence yields

[formula]

As the limit is the same for all subsequences, the sequence itself must converge, to σ.

In particular, if θ(n)t  =  θt (does not depend on n), then Theorem [\ref=thconv] states that θt is the constant σ. Finally, the tightness assumption on the sequence of processes θ(n)t can be verified by checking Aldous' condition (see [\cite=Aldous1978]).
