Introduction and preliminaries

Throughout this paper we will assume q to be a fixed number between 0 and 1. We denote by Dq the q-derivative of a function

[formula]

The Jackson definite q-integral of the function f is defined by

[formula]

From ([\ref=eq:1]) and ([\ref=eq:2]), we note that In this paper, we use the following notations:

[formula]

and

[formula]

The q-analogue of exponential function is defined by

[formula]

In [10], the q-analogues of Bernoulli polynomials are defined by the generating function to be

[formula]

In the special case, x = 0, Bn,q(0) = Bn,q is called the n-th q-Bernoulli number. From ([\ref=eq:6]), we can derive the following equation:

[formula]

where [formula] Let [formula] be the complex number field and let F be the set of all formal power series in variable t over [formula] with

[formula]

Let [formula] and let [formula] be the vector space of all linear functionals on [formula]. Now we denote by [formula] the action of the linear functional L on the polynomial p(x). We remind that the vector space operations on [formula] are defined by where c is any constant in [formula] (see [15,16]). For [formula], we define the linear functional on [formula] by setting

[formula]

Thus, by ([\ref=eq:8]) and ([\ref=eq:9]), we note that

[formula]

where δn,k is the Kronecker's symbol. Let [formula]. Then, by ([\ref=eq:8]) and ([\ref=eq:9]), we see that [formula] and so as linear functionals L = fL(t). It is easy to show that the map L  ↦  fL(t) is a vector space isomorphism from [formula] onto F. Henceforth, F denotes both the algebra of formal power series in t and the vector space of all linear functionals on [formula], and so an element f(t) of F is thought of as both a formal power series and a linear functional. We call F the q-umbral algebra. The q-umbral calculus is the study of q-umbral algebra. By ([\ref=eq:5]) and ([\ref=eq:10]), we easily see that [formula] and so [formula]. Notice that for all f(t) in F

For [formula], we have

[formula]

Let f(t),g(t)∈F with [formula] and [formula]. Then there exists a unique sequence sn(x) [formula] of polynomials such that [formula], (n,k  ≥  0), which is denoted by [formula]. The sequence sn(x) is called the q-Sheffer sequence for [formula]. For h(t),f(t),g(t)∈F and [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

where (t) is the compositional inverse of f(t), (see [15,16]). Recently, several authors have studied q-Bernoulli and Euler polynomials (see [1 - 17]). In this paper, we investigate some properties of q-Bernoulli polynomials arising from q-umbral calculus. Finally, we derive some interesting identities of q-Bernoulli polynomials from our results.
