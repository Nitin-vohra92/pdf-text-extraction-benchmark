BLOW UP OF SOLUTIONS OF SEMILINEAR HEAT EQUATIONS IN GENERAL DOMAINS

Introduction

We consider a nonlinear heat equation of the type

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], is a bounded domain, p > 1, T∈(0, +   ∞  ] and It is well known that the initial value problem ([\ref=eq:probl_parabolico]) is locally well posed in C0(Ω). Denoting with Tv0 the maximal existence time of the solution of ([\ref=eq:probl_parabolico]) with initial datum v0, we consider the set of the initial data for which the corresponding solution is global, namely:

[formula]

It is interesting to understand the geometrical properties of the set G. If we consider v0  =  ϑw, with w∈C0(Ω) and [formula], it is well known that if |ϑ| is small enough the solution of () with initial datum ϑw, exists globally. Moreover, if |ϑ| is sufficiently large, it is easy to see that the solution blows up in finite time as a consequence of the fact that it has negative energy (see [\cite=Levine] and [\cite=Ball]). It is interesting to understand what happens for intermediate values of ϑ. The case when w is positive is completely clear, as a matter of fact from the maximum principle for the heat equation it follows that there exists [formula] such that if [formula] then the solution with initial value ϑ  w is globally defined, while if [formula] it blows up in finite time. In the borderline case both global existence or blow up in finite time can occur.

Thus, if we define G+  =  {v0∈G,v0  ≥  0}, we can assert that G+ is star-shaped with respect to 0 (indeed it is a convex set). When the initial value changes sign the situation is different and, in general, the set G may be not star-shaped. In fact, if we define by up a radial sign changing solution of the stationary problem

[formula]

where Ω is the unit ball in [formula], with n > 2 and p > 1, it has been shown in [\cite=C-D-W] that there exists p* < pS, with [formula] and there exists ε > 0 such that if p* < p < pS and 0 < |1 - ϑ| < ε then [formula] i.e. the solution of ([\ref=eq:probl_parabolico]), with initial datum ϑup, blows up in finite time both for ϑ slightly greater and slightly smaller than 1. Hence G is not star-shaped since up∈G. Recently a similar result has been proved in [\cite=D-P-S] in the case when the dimension is two and the exponent p is sufficiently large.

Such a result does not hold in the case n = 1 (always considering p > 1). As a matter of fact in the one-dimensional case we have that for |ϑ| < 1, vϑ,p (the solution with initial value ϑ  up) is global and converges uniformly to zero, while it blows up in finite time if |ϑ| > 1.

The proofs of the results of [\cite=C-D-W] and [\cite=D-P-S] exploit strongly the radial symmetry of the stationary solutions. Hence it is natural to ask whether a similar result holds also in general domains and what kind of sign changing stationary solutions give rise to this phenomenon. Note that this cannot be true for any sign changing stationary solution as it is easy to see considering, for example, a nodal solution in the ball which is odd with respect to a symmetry hyperplane and has only two nodal domains. Here we show that, in the case when n > 2 and for exponents close to the critical one, the same blow up phenomenon occurs in any bounded domain considering a suitable class of sign changing solutions up of [\eqref=eq:probl]. More precisely we deal with solutions up of ([\ref=eq:probl]) with the following properties:

[formula] as [formula],

[formula] as [formula],

where S is the best Sobolev constant for the embedding of H10(Ω) into L2*(Ω). It has been proved in [\cite=P-W] that such solutions exist, assuming that Ω is a bounded smooth domain in [formula] with n > 2, symmetric with respect to the xi-coordinates ([formula]). Later in [\cite=M-P] the authors extend the same result to any general bounded and smooth domain in [formula], with n > 2. Moreover in [\cite=B-E-P_2007] it has been proved that condition (a) implies that [formula] has exactly two connected components while, when n  ≥  4, (b) implies that the nodal surface of up does not intersect the boundary ∂Ω and the positive part u+p and the negative part u-p concentrate at at the same point. One could easily verify that (a) is equivalent to We refer to [\cite=B-E-P_2007] for further properties of such solutions.

Our goal is to prove the following theorem.

Given problem ([\ref=eq:probl_parabolico]) with n > 2, [formula], and Ω a bounded smooth domain in [formula], there exists p* < pS with the following property: if p* < p < pS and up is a sign changing solution of the stationary problem ([\ref=eq:probl]) satisfying (a) and (b) then there exist [formula] such that if [formula] and ϑ  ≠  1 then vϑ,p, solution of ([\ref=eq:probl_parabolico]) with initial value ϑup, blows up in finite time.

To prove Theorem [\ref=teorema1] we use the following result which has been proved in [\cite=C-D-W] for general domains.

Let up be a sign changing solution of [\eqref=eq:probl] and let φ1,p be a first eigenfunction of the linearized operator Lp at up. Assume that

[formula]

Then there exists ε > 0 such that if 0 < |1 - ϑ| < ε, then vϑ,p, solution of ([\ref=eq:probl_parabolico]) with initial value ϑup, blows up in finite time.

Thus Theorem [\ref=teorema1] will be a consequence of the following

Let n > 2, 1 < p < pS, [formula] a bounded smooth domain and up a sign changing solution of ([\ref=eq:probl]) satisfying conditions (a) and (b). Then there exists p* < pS such that for p* < p < pS

[formula]

where φ1,p is the first positive eigenfunction of the linearized operator Lp at up.

Let us point out that for the proof of Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale] the property (b) of our stationary solutions is crucial. Note that both properties (a) and (b) are actually satisfied in the special case of radial sign changing solutions of ([\ref=eq:probl]) (in the ball) with two nodal regions. So this clarifies that it is neither the symmetry nor the one-dimensional character of the solution which leads to the blow up result obtained in [\cite=C-D-W] but rather these properties of the stationary solution that can hold in any bounded domain. Therefore we believe that also for other semilinear problems where such solutions exist, the same blow up result should be true.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale] is based on a rescaling argument about the maximum point of up. Indeed, analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the rescaled solutions and of the rescaled first eigenfunctions, we are able to prove [\eqref=jkgkdfhgl] by using the properties of the solutions of the limit problem. The same result of Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale] can be easily extended to the case when the initial datum is a nodal solution up,K of [\eqref=eq:probl] with a fixed number K > 2 of nodal regions satisfying:

[formula],

[formula] a nodal region Ω1p such that, setting

u1p,K  : =   up,K  ·  χΩ1p   and [formula]

then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Solutions of this type have been found in [\cite=M-P] [\cite=P-W] but other kind of solutions could be considered.

The outline of the proof is the following. In Section [\ref=kdjfkldksf] we prove some preliminary results, while in Section [\ref=kdhfsklhfbvcbxvbxvcbx] we study the asymptotic behavior of the first eigenvalue and of the first eigenfunction of the linearized operator at up. Finally in Section [\ref=kfkhfkshfkshfhsfhsfhksasasa] we prove Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale].

Preliminaries

Let us start by recalling some properties of our solutions. Lemma

Let (up) be a family of sign-changing solutions of ([\ref=eq:probl]) satisfying (a). Then

[formula]

with u+p  =   max Ω(up,0) and u-p  =   max Ω( - up,0).

We refer the reader to [\cite=B-E-P_2006]. We now describe the rescaled problem. Let us define

[formula]

where ap and Mp are such that [formula]. Without loss of generality, we can assume that up(ap) > 0.

Let us consider the limit problem in [formula], that is

[formula]

It is well known that the unique regular positive solution is radial and is given by Moreover any sign changing solution of [\eqref=eq:critico] has energy larger than [formula]. We have

For [formula]

[formula]

The proof is the same (with obvious changes) as the one of the similar statement in Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=B-E-P_2006] (see page 777).

Now we study the linearization of the limit problem ([\ref=eq:critico]), so we define the operator

[formula]

where U is the solution of ([\ref=eq:critico]). The Rayleigh functional associated to L* is

[formula]

and we define

[formula]

We observe that λ*1 >  -   ∞  , since U is bounded.

It can be shown, with standard arguments, that there exists a unique positive minimizer φ*1 to ([\ref=eq:inf]) which is radial and radially nonincreasing; moreover λ*1 is an eigenvalue of L* and φ*1 is an eigenvector associated to λ*1. For further details see [\cite=L-L].

We have the following.

λ*1 < 0,

every minimizing sequence of ([\ref=eq:inf]) has a subsequence which strongly converges in [formula].

Let us compute R on [formula], solution of the limit problem ([\ref=eq:critico]). We have

[formula]

since pS > 1. By definition ([\ref=eq:inf]) this implies that λ*1 < 0. To prove (ii) let us consider a sequence [formula], with [formula], which minimizes ([\ref=eq:inf]). It is easy to see that wn is bounded in [formula]; therefore, up to a subsequence, it converges weakly to some [formula] and strongly in L2({|x|  ≤  R}) for every R > 0. By the lower semicontinuity of the norm we have

[formula]

Moreover, for every ε > 0, we have

[formula]

where the last estimate is possible if we fix R large enough and then we take n sufficiently large. Thus and so

[formula]

This implies that [formula] and we can define: If we assume now by contradiction that [formula], it follows that

[formula]

since λ*1 < 0. By ([\ref=eq:28]) we deduce therefore that [formula] and so w is a minimizer. This also allows us to deduce that wn strongly converges to w in [formula], and this concludes the proof of (ii).

Asymptotic spectral analysis

We consider the linearized operator at up, that is:

[formula]

We denote by λ1,p the first eigenvalue of Lp in Ω and by φ1,p the corresponding positive eigenfunction such that φ1,p > 0 and [formula]. We have

[formula]

Let us define [formula] by

[formula]

and [formula] outside [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] and [formula] satisfies

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

This means that [formula] is a first eigenfunction of the operator

[formula]

and [formula] is the corresponding first eigenvalue.

The set [formula] is bounded in [formula].

As we have already remarked [formula]. Moreover, since λ1,p < 0 and and p < pS, we get

[formula]

i.e. the assertion.

We have

[formula]

We divide the proof in two steps:

By ([\ref=eq:inf]), we have [formula]. Thus

where R > 0. Let us first consider the last integral. We want to show that it can be made arbitrarily small. We have

for some constant C1 > 0. Therefore we can choose R so large that

To estimate the term note that we can split the integral on [formula] in the integral on

and the one on

Therefore we get

As for the first term of ([\ref=eq:33]) we have

where we have used Hölder's inequality (with exponents [formula] and [formula]) for the first estimate and the fact that, as a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lemma:bounded], [formula] is bounded in [formula] to obtain the last inequality. In order to estimate the last term in ([\ref=eq:7]), we use (ii) of Lemma [\ref=lemma:hp] to get

As [formula] in [formula], we have and so

but, as [formula], the term on the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:4]) can be made as small as we like, choosing R sufficiently large. Thus we have that, chosen R large enough, we can take p sufficiently close to pS so that

Let us now estimate the second term of ([\ref=eq:33])

where we used the fact that [formula] and condition (b) satisfied by our solutions. Recalling that [formula] in [formula], for R fixed as above and p sufficiently close to pS, we have

Thus ([\ref=eq:step1]) follows from ([\ref=eq:15])-([\ref=eq:2]).

Let us consider a regular cut-off function ψR(x) = ψR(r), for R > 0, such that

0  ≤  ψR  ≤  1 and ψR(r) = 1 for r  ≤  R, ψR(r) = 0 for r  ≥  2R,

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] in [formula] as [formula]. Therefore, by ([\ref=eq:inf]), we have that given ε > 0 we can fix R > 0 such that

For such a fixed value of R, arguing as in Step 1, we obtain that

for p close enough to pS. Then ([\ref=eq:step2]) follows from ([\ref=eq:11])-([\ref=eq:10]). By [\eqref=eq:step1] and [\eqref=eq:step2] we deduce [\eqref=gfgfgbvbvbncncnmxmx].

[formula] strongly converges to φ*1 in [formula].

By the definition of [formula], and what is stated in Theorem [\ref=teo:lambda], we have

[formula]

This implies that [formula] is a minimizing sequence for ([\ref=eq:inf]), and so the assertion follows by Proposition [\ref=prop:spectral] (see also Remark [\ref=kdhfsfhkdhkdhgkdhg]).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale]

We now proceed proving Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale].

Using φ1,p∈H10(Ω) as a test function in ([\ref=eq:probl]) we have

[formula]

while using up as a test function in ([\ref=eq:varphi]) we obtain

[formula]

Subtracting ([\ref=eq:12]) from ([\ref=eq:13]) we get Taking into account that λ1,p is negative, we have that, to determine the sign of [formula], we can study the sign of

[formula]

For convenience we consider which has the same sign of ([\ref=eq:21]). Now we prove that

[formula]

Since the term on the right hand side of ([\ref=eq:limite]) is positive, this will leads to the assertion of Theorem [\ref=teo:integrale]. By a simple change of variables it follows that:

[formula]

We take ε > 0 and choose R > 0 such that

[formula]

this is possible arguing as we did in the proof of ([\ref=eq:15]). We rewrite ([\ref=eq:16]) in the following way

[formula]

Now we analyze each term in the previous inequality. Splitting the integral on [formula] and on [formula] (see ([\ref=eq:omega+]) and ([\ref=eq:omega-]) for the definitions of such sets) we have

[formula]

As for the first term of ([\ref=eq:35]) we have

[formula]

where we have used Hölder's inequality (with exponents [formula] and [formula]) for the first estimate and the fact that, as a consequence of Lemma [\ref=lemma:bounded], [formula] is bounded in [formula]. Thus, with the same argument used to obtain ([\ref=eq:8]), we can state that, for every ε > 0, having chosen R large enough and taking p close enough to pS, we have

[formula]

Next we estimate the second term of ([\ref=eq:35]). We have

[formula]

where we have used Hölder's inequality (with exponent 2) for the first estimate, the fact that [formula] for the second and condition (b) satisfied by our solution. Note in particular that, for p close to pS, we may and do assume that [formula].

Moreover, recalling once again that [formula] in [formula], we deduce that:

[formula]

for R fixed as above and p sufficiently close to pS.

Finally, for R sufficiently large, the term

[formula]

can be made arbitrary small since [formula] and φ*1 is bounded.

Thus ([\ref=eq:16])-([\ref=eq:24]) and the arbitrary choice of ε imply ([\ref=eq:limite]) concluding the proof.
