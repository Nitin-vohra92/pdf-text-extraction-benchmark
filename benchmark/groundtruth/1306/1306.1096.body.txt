Symplectic Geography Problem in Dimension Six

Introduction

An almost complex structure J on an even dimensional smooth manifold X2n is a map from the tangent space TM to itself such that restriction to each fiber has the property J2 is negative of the identity map. If a manifold X has an almost complex structure J then the couple (X,J) is called an almost complex manifold. We are going to drop J and write X for such an almost complex manifold (X,J). Complex manifolds are examples of almost complex manifolds and not all almost complex manifolds are complex. An almost complex manifold X has special characteristic classes, namely the Chern classes ci(X), which are elements in the even cohomology group [formula]. The zeroth Chern class of X is [formula]. The total Chern class of X is [formula]. If X and Y are almost complex manifolds then c(X  ×  Y) is c(X)c(Y). Here product of individual Chern classes is the cup product of cohomology classes.

If n is equal to the sum of integers [formula], then the corresponding Chern number of X is evaluation [formula] on the fundamental class [formula]. The Chern numbers are integers. The top Chern number cn is equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold. In dimension four there are only two Chern numbers which are c21 and c2. The geography problem in dimension four has two parts. First, it is the search of smooth (or symplectic) 4-manifolds which admit a given couple (a,b) of integers as the Chern numbers. The second aim is to find the number of manifolds which admit the couple (a,b) as the Chern numbers. The latter is also known as the Botany problem ([\cite=Fintushel2009]).

For an almost complex 4-manifold X we have the equalities c21(X) = 3σ(X) + 2e(X) and c2(X) = e(X) where σ(X) is the signature of X and e(X) is the Euler characteristic of X. An almost complex 4-manifold has another invariant which is called the holomorphic Euler characteristic χh(X). It turns out that χh(X) is equal to (σ(X) + e(X)) / 4 which is completely topological. So the invariant χh(X) is extended to the smooth category by this equality.

Figure 1 is outlining the geography of smooth (or symplectic) 4-manifolds which is filled by manifolds which are constructed using some state of the art techniques. More information can be found in [\cite=Fintushel2009].

The Chern numbers of an almost complex 6-manifold M are c3, c31 and c1c2. Note that c3(M) is equal to the Euler characteristic e(M) of M. The complex geography problem in dimension six (complex dimension three) is explored by Hunt in [\cite=Hunt1989]. There are some studies on almost complex geography like [\cite=Okonek1995] and [\cite=Lebrun1999]. We are going to focus on symplectic geography, i. e. distribution of the Chern numbers of an compatible almost complex structure on a symplectic 6-manifold. Next theorem by Halic shows that the restrictions on the Chern numbers of symplectic 6-manifolds are mild.

(Halic [\cite=Halic1999]) The Chern numbers of a symplectic 6-manifold M satisfy the conditions given as:

[formula]

Conversely, for a triple (2r,2s,24t), where r, s and t are integers, there is a simply connected symplectic 6-manifold M with property (c3(M),c21(M),c1c2(M) is equal to (2r,2s,24t).

Halic constructed the manifolds for the second part of the theorem by using an operation which is called generalized symplectic fiber sum. This operation was first introduced by Gompf ([\cite=Gompf1995]). In six dimensional case let M1 and M2 be symplectic 6-manifolds. If X1 and X2 are codimension two symplectic submanifolds of M1 and M2 with trivial normal bundles, respectively, then the result of the fiber summing M1 and M2 through X1 and X2 is a symplectic 6-manifold M. The operation is done by removing a neighborhood of Xi in Mi, which is symplectomorphic to Xi  ×  D2 ([\cite=Weinstein1971]). Then M1 - nbd(X1) and M2 - nbd(X2) with a symplectomorphism of X1  ×  (D2 - 0) and X2  ×  (D2 - 0) turning D2 - 0 inside out. Details can be found in [\cite=Gompf1995].

In this note we are going to apply this construction as did Halic and get some manifolds on the geography picture. Our manifolds are do not add anything new to filling the geography picture since it is already filled, but their smooth types are potentially different from those constructed by Halic. Some of these manifolds symplectic Calabi-Yau manifolds (See Remark [\ref=CY]). Recently, similar manifolds are constructed by Akhmedov in [\cite=Akhmedov2011].

Construction and Chern Numbers

Let X1 and X2 be closed, simply connected, smooth 4-manifolds with Lefschetz fibration structures on them. The base manifolds of the Lefschetz fibrations are S2. Further information on Lefschetz fibrations may be found in [\cite=Gompf1999]. Let us assume that the generic fiber of the Lefschetz fibration on the respective Xi is an embedded surface Σi which has genus gi. Assume that each singular fiber has a unique double point (fishtail) singularity. Let ni be the number of singular fibers on each Lefschetz fibration. The Euler characteristic e(Xi) of such a 4-manifold is 2(2 - 2gi) + ni. In particular e(Xi) is equal to c2(Xi). Xi is simply connected means that ni is greater than 2gi.

Consider the product 6-manifolds X1  ×  Σ2 and X2  ×  Σ1 with the product symplectic structures on them. Let us apply the symplectic fiber sum operation ([\cite=Gompf1995], [\cite=Halic1999]) to these 6-manifolds over Σ1  ×  Σ2. As a result we get a closed, symplectic 6-manifold which we are going to denote by M.

As a symplectic manifold, M has a contractible family of almost complex structures which are compatible with the symplectic structure on it. With the formula of the Chern numbers for symplectic fiber sum ([\cite=Halic1999]), calculations for the Chern numbers c31, c1c2 and c3 of a generic almost complex structure on the product manifold M are given as follows:

Considering c2(Xi) = e(Xi) = 12χh(Xi) - c21(Xi), we can write c3 in terms of χh and c21.

Calculation of c31:

Calculation of c1c2:

If we summarize, the Chern numbers of M are as follows.

The Chern numbers of the symplectic 6-manifold M constructed by fiber summing X1  ×  Σ2 and X2  ×  Σ1 along Σ1  ×  Σ2 are:

where χh(Xi) is the holomorphic Euler characteristic of Xi.

Examples

In this section we give two families of symplectic 6-manifolds which are constructed using the fiber summing as above.

Let X1 be the elliptic surface E(m) with the Lefschetz fibration structure whose generic fibers are tori. χh(X1) is m and c21(X1) is 0. Let X2 be the ruled surface S2  ×  S2 and consider the sphere fibration structure on it with sphere sections of self-intersection zero. We may think of it as a Lefschetz fibration with no singular fibers. Genus g2 is zero. χh(X2) is 1 and c21(X2) is 8. Apply the construction explained in Section [\ref=construction] to manifolds X1, X2. Then the Chern numbers of the constructed symplectic manifold M are c3(M) = c1c2(M) = 24m and c31(M) = 0.

Let Y1 be the elliptic surface E(m) (m  ≥  1). Let Y2 be the manifold E(k)K (k  ≥  1) which is obtained by applying the knot surgery of Fintushel-Stern ([\cite=Fintushel1998a]) to the elliptic surface E(k) over the fibered knot K. For a fixed k, E(k) and E(k)K are homeomorphic to each other which means that χh(Y2) is k and c21(Y2) is zero. Y2 has an Lefschetz fibration with generic fiber genus 2g + k - 1, where g  ≥  0 is the genus of the knot ([\cite=Fintushel2004c]). If we apply the construction to manifolds Y1, Y2, then the Chern numbers of the constructed symplectic manifold M are c3(M) = c1c2(M) = 24m(2 - 2g - k) and c31(M) = 0.

All examples given above are simply connected. Throughout these families, although c31 is zero, the only manifold with c1 equal to zero is when we choose m = k = 2 and g = 0 in Example [\ref=example2]. See [\cite=Akhmedov2011] for further discussion on the symplectic Calabi-Yau manifolds.

Many similar examples may be produced by applying the procedure above. Still there will be triples (2r,2s,24t) which we can not realize as Chern numbers due to the fact that c31 is divisible by six for the product manifold of this operation. This is behind the result of Halic in [\cite=Halic1999]. However, potentially all of manifolds constructed in Example [\ref=example2] are diffeomorphic for a fixed k. It may be interesting to see if they are diffeomorphic.
