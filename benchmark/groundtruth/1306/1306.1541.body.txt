The Grunewald-O'Halloran conjecture for nilpotent Lie algebras of rank ≥  1

Introduction

The study of the algebraic varieties of Lie algebras, solvable, and nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension n turned out to be a very hard subject. The theory of deformations of algebras started with a series of papers by Gerstenhaber, the first being [\cite=G]. Since then a lot of efforts has been done (see for instance [\cite=NR1] [\cite=R] [\cite=NR2] [\cite=V] [\cite=C1] [\cite=K]), however many natural questions remain unsolved. For example, the determination of the irreducible components of the variety of nilpotent Lie algebras seems today out of reach.

Among the open questions there are two conjectures about nilpotent Lie algebras. One, due to Grunewald and O'Halloran [\cite=GO2], states that every complex nilpotent Lie algebra is the degeneration of another, non isomorphic, Lie algebra. The other one, known as Vergne's conjecture, states that there are no rigid complex nilpotent Lie algebras in the algebraic variety Ln of complex Lie algebras of dimension n. Meaning that there are no nilpotent Lie algebras with open orbit in Ln, that is such that their isomorphisms classes are open in Ln. The first conjecture is a priori stronger than the second one. In this short paper we address the Grunewald-O'Halloran conjecture.

It is well known that, over fields of characteristic zero, geometric rigidity is equivalent to formal rigidity, the latest meaning that all formal deformations are trivial [\cite=GS]. However, this does not imply that the Grunewald-O'Halloran conjecture and Vergne's conjecture are equivalent. If so, it would also imply that every non geometrically rigid Lie algebra is the degeneration of another non isomorphic Lie algebra, which is not true already in dimension n = 3. In fact the only complex rigid Lie algebra of dimension 3 is the simple Lie algebra [formula] and, for instance, the solvable (non nilpotent) Lie algebra [formula], where [formula] is the 2-dimensional solvable Lie algebra, is on top of the Hasse diagram of degenerations, and in particular it is not the degeneration of any other Lie algebra (see [\cite=CD] and [\cite=BSt]).

Complex Lie algebras and nilpotent Lie algebras of small dimension are classified and in this cases all the degenerations among them and also which are rigid is known. All degenerations that occur among complex Lie algebras of dimension ≤  4 are given in [\cite=St] and [\cite=BSt]. In [\cite=GO1] and [\cite=Se] all degenerations for complex nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 5 and 6 are given and more recently, in [\cite=B], some degenerations for some 5-step and 6-step complex nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7 are given. Results on the different varieties and on rigidity in low dimensions may be found in [\cite=CD] [\cite=C2]. In [\cite=AG] and [\cite=AGGV] the components of the varieties of nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7 and 8 are given.

Carles [\cite=C1] investigated the structure of rigid Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. In particular he proved that nilpotent Lie algebras of rank ≥  1 are never rigid and moreover nilpotent Lie algebras with a codimension 1 ideal of rank ≥  1 are also never rigid. That is, Vergne's conjecture holds for this class, remaining open for characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras for which all its ideals of codimension 1 are also characteristically nilpotent.

In the paper [\cite=GO2], the authors constructed nontrivial linear deformations for large classes of nilpotent Lie algebras and left open the question of which of those deformations correspond to degenerations. Their construction of linear deformations of a given Lie algebra [formula], relies on the existence of a codimension 1 ideal [formula] of [formula] with a semisimple derivation [formula], and applies not only to nilpotent Lie algebras. In general, the deformations constructed do not correspond to a degeneration. A fixed ideal [formula] may produce many non equivalent deformations, some of which may correspond to a degeneration and some may not.

We prove two things. On the one hand we prove that the Grunewald-O'Halloran conjecture holds for nilpotent Lie algebras of rank ≥  1, leaving it open for characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras. On the other hand, we prove that the conjecture holds for 7-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras and moreover and interesting for us we exhibit explicit degenerations to each 7-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra.

More precisely, we show that if the semisimple derivation D of [formula] is the restriction to [formula] of a semisimple derivation of [formula], then the associated deformation does correspond to a degeneration. Then we are able to prove the following.

If [formula] is a complex nilpotent Lie algebra with a nontrivial semisimple derivation, then [formula] is the degeneration of another, non isomorphic, Lie algebra.

The first characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras appear in dimension 7. Hence, by Theorem [\ref=thm:1], the Grunewald-O'Halloran conjecture holds in dimension < 7. Complex nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7 are classified: there are infinitely many isomorphism classes and infinitely many of them are characteristically nilpotent. We shall refer to the classification by Magnin [\cite=M]. We work out this family on a case by case basis, by considering linear deformations constructed after choosing suitable codimension 1 ideals and particular derivations of them, proving the following result.

Every complex nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension ≤  7, is the degeneration of another, non isomorphic, Lie algebra.

We note that the variety of complex nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7 has two components, each of which is the closure of the orbit of a family of Lie algebras [\cite=AG]. Being degeneration transitive, to proof Theorem [\ref=thm:2] it is enough to find nontrivial degenerations to these two families. In the case of dimensions < 7 this argument reduces the proof to finding a nontrivial degeneration to a single algebra. This is easy to do and for completeness we do it in dimension 6.

In this paper all Lie algebras will be over the complex numbers.

Linear deformations and degenerations

Let Ln be the algebraic variety of complex Lie algebras of dimension n, that is the algebraic variety of Lie brackets μ on [formula] ([formula]). Given a complex Lie algebra [formula], we shall refer to it indistinctly by [formula], [formula] or μ. The group [formula] acts on Ln by 'change of basis':

[formula]

Thus the orbit O(μ) of μ in Ln, is the isomorphism class of μ.

A Lie algebra μ is said to degenerate to a Lie algebra λ, denoted by [formula], if [formula], the Zariski closure of O(μ). If [formula], then λ is in the boundary of the orbit O(μ) but outside it. Since the Zariski closure of O(μ) coincides with its closure in the relative topology of [formula], if [formula], t  ↦  gt, is continuous and lim t  ↦  0gt  ·  μ  =  λ, then [formula]. The degeneration [formula] is said to be realized by a 1-PSG, if gt is a 1-parameter subgroup as a morphism of algebraic groups. Recall that if gt is a 1-PSG, then gt is diagonalizable with eigenvalues tmi for some integers mi.

A linear deformation of a Lie algebra μ is, for the aim of this paper, a family μt, [formula], of Lie algebras such that

[formula]

where φ is a skew-symmetric bilinear form on [formula]. It turns out that μt is a linear deformation of μ if and only if φ is a Lie algebra bracket which in addition is a 2-cocycle of μ.

If a given a linear deformation μt of μ is such that μt∈O(μ1) for all [formula], then [formula]. In fact, for each [formula] there exist gt∈GLn such that g- 1t  ·  μ1  =  μt, then lim t  ↦  0g- 1t  ·  μ1  =   lim t  ↦  0μt  =  μ. Hence, in order to show that [formula], one only needs to prove that for each [formula] there exist gt∈GLn such that

[formula]

Construction of linear deformations

We recall now the construction of linear deformations in [\cite=GO2].

Let [formula] be a given Lie algebra of dimension n and let [formula] be a codimension 1 ideal of [formula] with a semisimple derivation D. For any element X of [formula] outside [formula], [formula]. The bilinear form μD on [formula] defined by μD(X,z) = D(z) and μD(y,z) = 0, for [formula], is a 2-cocycle for μ and a Lie bracket. Hence,

[formula]

is a linear deformation of μ. If [formula] is nilpotent, then μt is always solvable but not nilpotent. In particular, μt is not isomorphic to μ for all [formula]. The construction described above can be carried out also for any derivation D, not necessarily semisimple. However, one can not assure that μt is not isomorphic to μ in this case.

Degenerations from deformations

Under certain hypothesis on the derivation D, the deformation constructed above does correspond to a degeneration.

Let [formula] be a nilpotent Lie algebra with an ideal [formula] of codimension 1 admitting a nontrivial semisimple derivation D. If D is the restriction of a semisimple derivation D̃ of [formula] such that it is nontrivial on a direct invariant complement of [formula], then [formula] is the degeneration of another, non isomorphic, Lie algebra. Moreover, the degeneration can be realized by a 1-PSG.

Let [formula]. Let X be an eigenvector of D̃ complementary to [formula] and let λ0  ≠  0 be its eigenvalue. We may assume that λ0 = 1 (by considering D̃  /  λ0 and D / λ0 instead of D̃ and D).

Let [formula] be the different eigenvalues of D and let [formula] be the corresponding graded decomposition of [formula], that is [formula].

Hence,

[formula]

where both summands of [formula] are D̃-invariant and [formula].

Let μt  =  μ + tμD be the linear deformation constructed as in [\eqref=eqn:linear-def], which is given by

[formula]

Let gt∈GLn, where [formula], be defined by

[formula]

It is not difficult to check that [\eqref=eqn:degeneration] is satisfied. In fact, if [formula] and [formula] for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  k, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Therefore, being μ1 solvable, μ is the degeneration of another, non isomorphic, Lie algebra.

In the above proposition the ideal [formula] is given, but clearly any such ideal will work. Hence, if D̃ is a derivation of [formula] that preserves an ideal [formula] and such that its restriction to [formula] is semisimple, we get for [formula] the same conclusion of Proposition [\ref=prop:restriction]. This is the statement in Theorem [\ref=thm:1].

The semisimple derivation D of [formula] preserves the (characteristic) ideal

[formula]

and let [formula] be a basis of V formed by eigenvectors of D. Since V generates [formula] as a Lie algebra (see for instance [\cite=J], page 29) and D is nontrivial, D is nontrivial on V and we may assume that X1 is an eigenvector with nonzero eigenvalue. Now let [formula]. Clearly [formula] is an ideal of [formula] of codimension 1, D preserves [formula], [formula] is semisimple and D is nontrivial on X1. Therefore, by Proposition [\ref=prop:restriction], [formula] is the degeneration of a Lie algebra non isomorphic to [formula].

The conjecture in dimension 7

All nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension < 7 have semisimple derivations. Therefore the Grunewald-O'Halloran conjecture holds in this case.

Moreover, in dimensions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 all nilpotent Lie algebras (finite number of isomorphism classes) are the degeneration of a single one [\cite=GO1] [\cite=Se]. Hence, an algebra degenerating to it degenerates to all the others as well.

By considering different linear deformations, we found that each nilpotent Lie algebra of dimension < 7 is the degeneration of many others, non isomorphic, Lie algebras. Many of those degenerations can be realized by a 1-PSG, but others can not.

The 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra 12346E in [\cite=Se], that we rename μ, defined by

[formula]

degenerates to all other nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 6 [\cite=Se].

We now construct a solvable linear deformation of μ that degenerates to it, and therefore to all other 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras. To this end consider the ideal [formula] and the derivation D of [formula] defined by

[formula]

This produces the 2-cocycle μD, defined by

[formula]

The corresponding deformation of μ, μt  =  μ + tμD, is then given by

[formula]

and in particular μ1 is given by

[formula]

Let gt∈GL6 be the 1-PSG given by

[formula]

It is easy to verify that, for all t  ≠  0, g- 1t  ·  μ1  =  μt and thus [formula].

The variety of nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 7 has two irreducible components, each of which is the closure of the orbits of two families μ1α and μ2α, with [formula] [\cite=AG]. The first family is made of nilpotent Lie algebras of rank ≥  1, while the second family is made entirely of characteristically nilpotent algebras.

By Theorem [\ref=thm:1] and being degeneration transitive, to prove Theorem [\ref=thm:2] it suffices to find for each algebra in the second family another non isomorphic Lie algebra degenerating to it. All algebras μ2α are indecomposable, because in dimension 7 all the decomposables are of rank ≥  1. In what follows we refer to the classification by Magnin [\cite=M]. Here the (indecomposable) characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras are given as a continuous family and seven isolated algebras:

[formula]

Without identifying the algebras μ2α within this classification, Theorem [\ref=thm:2] follows if we are able to construct for each of these another Lie algebra degenerating to it. Notice that by doing this, we are exhibiting for each 7-dimensional characteristically nilpotent Lie algebra, another one degenerating non-trivially to it, something that we find interesting in itself.

We start by considering the family [formula], which is defined by

[formula]

Take the ideal [formula] and [formula] defined by

[formula]

The corresponding 2-cocycle μD is given by

[formula]

and the corresponding deformation μt  =  μ  +  tμD of μ is given by

[formula]

Consider now gt = gt(λ)∈GL7 given by

[formula]

The calculations below show that g- 1t  ·  μ1  =  μt and thus μ1  →  degμ.

For the remaining seven algebras μ we give, in the table below, the ideal [formula] of codimension 1, the semisimple derivation [formula] that we choose to construct the linear deformation μt, and the family gt∈GL7 satisfying g- 1t  ·  μ1  =  μt, which is not difficult to check by hand. Therefore [formula] and the proof is complete.
