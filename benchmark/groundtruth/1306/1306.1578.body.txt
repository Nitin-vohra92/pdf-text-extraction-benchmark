Emitters of N-photon bundles

Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) allows to control the interaction of light with matter at the ultimate quantum limit [\cite=haroche_book06a] with prospects for engineering new generations of light sources [\cite=walther06a] [\cite=obrien09a]. In this Letter, we propose a family of N -photon emitters, i.e., sources that release their energy exclusively in bundles of N photons (for integer N). The statistics of emission of the bundles can be varied with system parameters from antibunching to poissonian, thereby realizing N-photon guns and N-photon lasers. Such non-classical emitters are highly sought for robust quantum information processing, generating NOON states [\cite=afek10a], quantum lithography and metrology [\cite=giovannetti04a], but also for medical applications, allowing for higher penetration lengths and increased resolution with minimum harm to the tissues [\cite=denk90a] [\cite=horton13a]. The recent demonstration that biological photoreceptors are sensitive to photon statistics [\cite=sim12a] may also render such sources highly relevant for studies of biological photosystems and, potentially, of quantum biology.

Our scheme relies on the paradigm of cQED: one two-level system in a cavity. This is realized in a wealth of physical systems, ranging from atoms in optical cavities [\cite=brune96a] to superconducting qubits in microwave resonators [\cite=fink08a] and quantum dots in microcavities [\cite=kasprzak10a]. The dynamics is well described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian [formula] with a and σ the second quantization annihilation operators of the light field (boson statistics) and the Quantum Emitter (QE, two-level system), respectively, with corresponding free energies ωa and ωσ and coupling strength g [\cite=jaynes63a]. The configuration under study is the resonant excitation by an external laser of the QE [\cite=nguyen11a] [\cite=matthiesen12a] [\cite=jayakumar13a] far in the dispersive regime with the cavity ([formula]) [\cite=majumdar10a] [\cite=hughes11a] [\cite=laussy12e] (Fig. [\ref=fig:1](a)). The energy structure of H0 is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:1](b) with the QE at Δ / g =  - 60 (Δ  =  ωa  -  ωσ), in which case the states are essentially the bare ones. The laser of frequency [formula] and pumping intensity Ω is included by adding [formula] to H0. At pumping low enough not to distort the level structure, one can excite selectively a state with N photon(s) in the cavity at the (N + 1)th rung by adjusting the laser frequency to satisfy

[formula]

with [formula] [\cite=chough00a]. This is shown in the figure [\ref=fig:1](b) for the case N = 2, with a photon-blockade [\cite=birnbaum05a] [\cite=faraon08a] at all other rungs (above and below) [\cite=schuster08a] [\cite=bishop09a]. The positions of the resonances in the case Δ / g =  - 60 are shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](b). Rightmost is the resonant excitation of the QE while other resonances pile up towards the cavity frequency, showing a transition from the quantized features of the QE towards the classical continuum of the cavity. In the absence of dissipation, this leads to the generation of an exotic brand of maximally entangled polaritons, of the type [formula] rather than the usual case [formula]. The dynamics of the system driven upon exciting the case N = 2, corresponding to the excitation of the third rung, is presented in Fig. [\ref=fig:1](c), both in linear and log-scales. Full amplitude Rabi oscilations between the [formula] and [formula] states are observed.

When increasing pumping, resonances in the amplitude of the Rabi oscillations persist but are blueshifted due to the dressing of the Jaynes-Cummings states by the laser. The level structure becomes that of a dressed atom [\cite=cohentannoudji77a] strongly detuned from a cavity mode [\cite=zakrzewski91a], leading to resonances at:

[formula]

realized when the energy of N cavity-photons match the N-photon transition between the |  -  〉 and |  +  〉 levels of the dressed atom, as sketched in Fig. [\ref=fig:1](c) for the case N = 2. In the indeterminate case N = 1, Eq. [\eqref=eq:juesep5201806CEST2013] should be taken in the limit N  →  1, yielding ωL  =  ωa - (2Ω2  +  Δ2 / 2) / Δ (in the dispersive regime, Δ  ≠  0). All the dynamics discussed so far correspond to systems that are Hamiltonian in nature, such as atomic cQED realizations [\cite=gleyzes07a].

Strong dissipation, e.g., in semiconductor cQED, is not detrimental to quantum effects [\cite=volz12a] [\cite=majumdar12a]. On the contrary, Purcell enhancement of such Hamiltonian resonances may give rise to giant photon correlations in the statistics of the field detected outside the cavity instead of Rabi oscillations [\cite=delvalle11d] [\cite=zubairy80a]. The corresponding zero-delay photon correlations g(n) [\cite=glauber63b] are shown in the limit of vanishing pumping in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](a). An antibunching dip is observed for each g(n) when exciting resonantly the emitter, followed by a series of N - 1 huge bunching peaks that match precisely the resonances Eq. ([\ref=eq:juesep5202411CEST2013]), plotted in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](b). In these calculations, as for all the following results, the Hamiltonian has been supplemented with superoperators in the Lindblad form to describe dissipation of the cavity (resp. QE) at a rate γa (resp. γσ) [\cite=kavokin_book11a]. Parameters used for the examples shown here are γa / g = 0.1 and γσ / g = 0.01. As pumping is increased, resonances in g(n) shift, as expected, along curves CN in the [formula] space defined by Eq. ([\ref=eq:juesep5201806CEST2013]). This is shown for g(2) in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](c) for three values of pumping, starting with Ω0 = 10- 1g, close to the vanishing pumping case shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](b). Following g(2) along the C2 resonance shows that a new peak emerges out of a uniform background, reaching a maximum [formula] at the pumping [formula] (middle trace) before a depletion of the resonance forms for higher pumping, reaching its minimum along C2 of g(2)  ≈  17 at [formula] (background trace).

Such resonances are indicative of strong correlations but not in an intuitive way nor in a particularly useful one for applications, since g(2) is unbounded and cannot be interpreted in terms of probability of two-photon emission. Other quantities to measure correlations, such as the differential correlation function [\cite=kubanek08a] or the surge [\cite=hong10a], present the same problem. To gain insights into the dissipative context, we turn to a quantum Monte Carlo approach [\cite=plenio98a], where one can follow individual trajectories of the system and record photon clicks whenever the system undergoes a quantum jump. A tiny fraction of such a trajectory when the third rung is excited is presented in Figs. [\ref=fig:3](a-c), showing the probabilities of the system to be in the states [formula] for n up to 2 (probabilities in higher rungs are included in the numerical simulation but do not play a role in the dynamics). Until time [formula] (in units of 1 / γa), the QE essentially undergoes fast Rabi flopping (in an empty cavity) under the action of the laser, corresponding to the Mollow regime. At the same time, the driving of the third rung makes the probability to have two photons in the cavity sizable, as can be seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:3](c) where the combined probability reaches over 1%, while the probability to have one photon is more than two orders of magnitude smaller. The high probability of the two-photon state eventually results in the emission of a first cavity photon indicated by a red triangle at the top of the figure, that collapses the wavefunction into the one-photon state, that is now the state with almost unit probability. While only the continued Rabi flopping of the QE was extremely likely at any moment of time before the first photon emission, the system is now expected to emit a second photon within the cavity lifetime of the first one. This corresponds to the second red triangle in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](a) denoting the second photon emission within 0.2 / γa of its precursor. There is a jitter in the emission of the two-photon state due to the cavity, but this does not destroy their correlation. Phrased equivalently, the two-photon picture holds outside of a small time window constrained by the cavity decay rate. After the two-photon emission, the system is left in a vacuum state but without Rabi flopping, that is restored after a direct emission from the QE (black triangle) and a two-photon state is again constructed, preparing for the next emission of a correlated photon pair. The system is brought back to its starting point, conserving total energy over a cycle, by direct emission from the QE. Although one QE photon is emitted per two-photon emission cycle, it is at another frequency and in a different solid angle. The two-photon emission is through the cavity mode, being therefore strongly focused.

It must be stressed that such quantum dynamics producing cavity photons in pairs does not correspond to the huge bunching resonances in g(2) in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](c). Here, the system indeed emits more frequently two photons as compared to a random source with the same intensity, but with an overwhelming predominance of single photons, as is observed when considering the actual emission of the system. Figures [\ref=fig:3](d-e) present a series of detection events such as they would be recorded by a streak camera photodetector [\cite=wiersig09a], calculated by the quantum Monte Carlo method for the pumping values Ω1 and Ω2 of Fig. [\ref=fig:2](c) at C2. The horizontal axis represents time and each row of points denotes a detection event as the detection spot is raster scanned accross the image. The red points correspond to one photon detection events and blue points to correlated two-photon emissions. Indeed, while the strong bunching in Fig. [\ref=fig:2](c) at Ω1 only conveys that the number of correlated two-photon events (blue points) in Fig. [\ref=fig:3](d) is much larger than would be expected for a coherent source, the emission remains predominantly in terms of single photons. Whilst the resonances in statistics are strong, they are therefore not meaningful for applications. On the other hand, at Ω2, when the g(2) resonance is depleted, the emission now consists almost exclusively of correlated photon pairs, as can be seen by the dominance of blue points in Fig. [\ref=fig:3](e). The standard correlation functions g(n) are therefore not suitable to describe the physics of N-photon emission. Photon-counting [\cite=srinivas81a] [\cite=zoller86a] [\cite=osadko09a] is a convenient way to quantify the amount of N-photon emission in practical terms, since an ideal N-photon emitter never produces a number of photons which is not a multiple of N [\cite=carmichael93a]. We observe that for time windows T much larger than the coherence time, counting of the photon bundles becomes poisson distributed, as short time correlations are lost [\cite=loudon_book00a]. In that limit, the random variable XN that counts bundles of N photons in a time window T is P(XN = k) =  exp ( - λNT)(λNT)k / N / (k / N)! if k is a multiple of N, and is zero otherwise, with a generating function ΠXN(s) = 〈sXN〉 = e-  λN(1 - sN). This distribution is shown in Fig. {[\ref=fig:3](f) for the cases of ideal two-photon (2PE) and three-photon (3PE) emission. The latter is shown for a larger counting time window to shift the distribution sidewise. A non-ideal N-photon emitter occasionally emit single photons that spoil these distributions. Photon counting then results from the sum of two random variables X1 + XN where X1 is a conventional Poisson process. The generating function of the imperfect N-photon emitter is ΠX1 + X2  =  ΠX1ΠX2 with distribution to count n photons in the time window T:

[formula]

When the suppression of photon emission that is not a multiple of N is efficient, we find these parameters to be related to the cavity population through λN  =  γana / N. The λ parameters being independent of the time window T, are suited to characterize N-photon emission. Therefore, we define the purity of N-photon emission, πN, as:

[formula]

This ratio represents the percentage of N-photon bundles, that can now be contrasted with g(N), as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:3](g) for N = 2. Here we find the remarkable result that g(2), often described as the probability for two-photon emission, is in fact anticorrelated with π2, the actual such probability: when g(2) reaches its maximum, π2 is starting to grow and when π2 is maximum, g(2) is locally minimum, although still larger than 1.

We characterize the efficiency of N-photon emission by plotting the purity and emission together, in Fig. [\ref=fig:4] for π2 and π3, in the case γσ / g = 0.01. Since N-photon emission is a (N + 1)th order process, it is more easily overcome by dissipation as N increases. However, almost pure two-photon and three-photon emission is already feasible with state of the art cavity QED systems: ≈  85% of two-photon emission can be obtained in semiconductor samples (γa / g  ≈  0.5, g  ≈  12 GHz) [\cite=ota11a] [\cite=laucht09a] with a rate over 107 counts per second (cps), while circuit QED systems (γa / g  ≈  0.01, g  ≈  50 MHz) [\cite=nissen13a] can even reach ≈  90% of three-photon emission with a rate of 103 cps.

Various regimes of N-photon emission can be characterized by studying the statistics of the bundles when considered as single entities. To do so we introduce the generalized correlation functions g(n)N as:

[formula]

with T± the time ordering operators. This upgrades the concept of the nth order correlation function for isolated photons to bundles of N photons. The case N = 1 recovers the definition of the standard g(n) [\cite=loudon_book00a], but for [formula], the normalization to the bundle density makes Eq. ([\ref=eq:mieoct9203726CEST2013]) essentially different from the standard correlation functions g(n  ×  N). Similarly to the single-photon case, the two-bundle statistics [formula] is the most important one. The validity of this definition for g(2)2 is confirmed in Figs. [\ref=fig:3](h-i), where it is plotted (smooth curve) along with direct coincidences between clicks from the Monte Carlo simulation (data). Such g(2)2 correlations can be measured thanks to recent developments in two-photon detection [\cite=boitier09a]. For the computation from the Monte Carlo clicks, all events are considered as single photons for the standard g(2) calculation (red curve in Fig. [\ref=fig:3](h-i)), and only two-photon events are considered as the basic unit of emission for g(2)2 (blue curve). Except in the small jitter window of width 1 / γa, photon pairs exhibit antibunching for long-lived QE while they are Poisson distributed for short-lived QE. In the latter case, one can also check that g(3)2(τ1,τ2)  =  1 except from the aforementioned jitter window. The emitter therefore behaves respectively as a two-photon gun, and--according to Glauber [\cite=glauber63b]--as a laser (in the sense of a coherent source), but at the two-photon level. At the single-photon level, the standard g(2)(τ) fails to capture this fundamental dynamics of emission. The same behaviour holds for higher N.

In conclusion, we have shown how to exploit cQED resonances in a dissipative context to realize non-classical quantum sources that emit most of the light in bundles of N photons. We introduced new quantities to characterize such kind of systems, namely, the percentage πN of the total emission that comes as N-photon bundles, and generalized correlation functions g(n)N that overtake the standard definition in the regime of N-photon emission. This allowed us to propose a whole class of versatile N-photon emitters, ranging from quantum guns to lasers.
