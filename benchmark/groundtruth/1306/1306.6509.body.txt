78 pairs of possible PSR-SNR associations

Criteria for Association

Position

The associated PSR/SNR should roughly be in the same direction and at the same distance, i.e. the same position. SNRs have extended structures, so associated PSRs are usually inside SNRs. To determine distances of both PSRs and SNRs are challenge jobs. Sometimes a pair of association listed in our table may have different distance values. The difference might be caused by distance estimate methods and could be reduced by future measurement.

PSR��s age

The measured ages of both the PSRs and SNRs should be the same within the error ranges. The characteristic age of a PSR can be easily got. We compare the real age and the characteristic age of three well-known PSRs. The large age discrepancy between real and characteristic value of three PSRs suggests that pulsar characteristic age is poor age estimator for young pulsars.

PWN

Pulsars steadily dissipate their rotational energy via relativistic winds. Confinement of these outflows generates luminous pulsar wind nebulae, seen across the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton emission and in optical emission lines when they shock the surrounding medium. PSR��s relativistic particle winds make SNR brighter. So the PWN can be seen as a strong evidence of interaction between a PSR and a SNR which also becomes a reliable sign of association.
