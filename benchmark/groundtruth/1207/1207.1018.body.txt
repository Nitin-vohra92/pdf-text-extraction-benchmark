Critical behavior of the Ising model with long range interactions

While the Ising model long range interactions (LRI) has been studied for a long time as a generalization of the Ising model with short range interactions, very few results have been obtained for the case of weak interactions decaying faster than the dimension d since the first works in the 70's [\cite=mukamel]. We will recall some of these results after defining the model that we will consider in this letter. The Ising model with LRI is defined by the Hamiltonian:

[formula]

with spins taking values Si  =    ±  1 on the sites i of a regular lattice and rij the distance between the spins on the sites i and j. The sum < ij >  is over all the pair of spins and we will consider only a ferromagnetic interaction J > 0.

In 1972, Fisher and al. [\cite=fisher] performed a renormalization group (RG) study for the O(n) model with LRI (the Ising model corresponding to n = 1). They identified three regimes (for d  >  1) : i) the classical regime with σ  ≤  d / 2 which is believed to be with a mean-field behavior, ii) an intermediate regime for d / 2  <  σ  <  2, iii) the short range regime for σ  ≥  2. The value σ = d / 2 marks the border of the mean field regime, meaning that the ordinary perturbation parameter ε  =  4 - d is replaced by 2σ - d. In [\cite=fisher] the relation η = 2  -  σ was also conjectured in the intermediate regime. This result was questioned since for σ  =  2, the exponent η vanish while for σ  >  2 its value has to be the one of the short range model ηsr which is positive for d  <  4. Then it would imply a jump of the exponent η from 0 up to ηsr at σ = 2. This point was first considered by Sak [\cite=sak], who, by taking in account higher order terms in the RG calculations, predicted that the change of behavior from the intermediate to the short range regime takes place at σ  =  2 - ηsr. Many other studies have considered also this problem with various conclusions. In particular, van Enter [\cite=van] obtained that for n  ≥  2, long range perturbations are relevant in the regime 2  -  ηsr  ≤  σ  ≤  2 in contradiction with Sak results. Gusmão and Theumann [\cite=gusthe], by considering a development in terms of ε' = 2σ  -  d in place of ε  =  2  -  σ, obtained a similar result, namely the stability of the long range perturbation for σ  ≤  2.

Note that all these studies are using a renormalisation group approach with an ε expansion of a Landau-Ginzburg effective Hamiltonian such that the propagator contains a pσ term in addition to the ordinary p2 term. While it is know that this approach gives accurate results for two and three dimensions for the short range model (with just the p2 term) [\cite=jlgjzj], it is only after comparing these predictions with other methods, numerical, high temperature expansions, (and the exact result in two dimensions),  that we can believe in these predictions. Similar comparisons need also to be done when considering the case with LRI and this is the main purpose of the study presented in this letter.

A first numerical study of the exponent η for d = 2 as a function of σ has already been done by Luijten and Blöte [\cite=lb]. In particular, they obtained in the intermediate regime a result well described by the exponent η  =  2 - σ up to 2  -  σ  =  ηsr and η  =  ηsr  =  1 / 4 for larger σ. Thus their measured exponent is in agreement with η ~  =  ~ (2 - σ,1 / 4) which corresponds to the RG predictions of [\cite=sak].

In the present study, we improve Luijten and Blöte study. In particular, we repeat the measurement of η close to the region where its behavior is changing, i.e. for σ≃2  -  ηsr. We confirm their result that there is no discontinuity but we measure a clear deviation from the behavior predicted by Sak [\cite=sak].

In order to be able to consider large lattices, we need to employ an efficient algorithm. Since the model is ferromagnetic, we can employ a cluster algorithm which will reduce the auto correlation time, that is the number of upgrades between two successive independent configurations. For the short range Ising model, Wolff algorithm, which builds a single cluster per update, is the most efficient one [\cite=wolff]. We will adapt this algorithm to the case with LRI. The algorithm can be summarized by the following steps. We start from a spin Si at some randomly selected position i. Next, we add to this spin any other spin Sj with a probability

[formula]

with β the inverse temperature. We repeat the same operation with all the added spins. In order to build a cluster containing M spins on a lattice of N sites, we have to compute the probability ([\ref=prob]) for ≃N  ×  M bonds, then the number of operations is O(N  ×  M). This number of operations will be drastically reduced by our algorithm that we will describe now. We will present here only the main steps of this algorithm, a more complete version will be presented elsewhere [\cite=mp].

The main idea is that since p(rij) is very small for large rij, then it is much faster to compute the probability that one (or more than one spin) among all the spins at this distance are connected to the original spin Si. In practice, to build this cluster we proceed as follow. First, starting from some arbitrary position i, we order in some pile [formula] of length N - 1 all the other positions on the lattice, ordered in function of the distance. To be more precise, the pile will contain the difference of positions between the point i and j. The pile P1 will be the same for any i, so this operation is done only once. Next we consider all n(r) spins at a distance r. This is a very fast operation if we build a second pile P2(r) containing the position of the first spin in P1 at a distance r. Then n(r)  =  P2(r')  -  P2(r), with r' the smallest distance on the lattice such that r'  >  r. For a given configuration of spins and a given starting point i, we need only to consider the spins with the same value as Si and which are not already part of the cluster under construction. We denote by n'(r)  ≤  n(r) the number of such spins. Then the decomposition

[formula]

will contain the probability of having zero spins connected p(r)n'(r), of having one spin connected n'(r)p(r)n'(r) - 1(1 - p(r)), two spins connected n'(r)(n'(r) - 1)p(r)n'(r) - 2(1 - p(r))2 / 2,   Next we randomly generate a number ε in the interval
