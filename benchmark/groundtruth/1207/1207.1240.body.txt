Scaling properties of correlated random walks

The dimensionless CDTRW

Originally, a CDTRW does not have any physical scales δx or δt attached to its steps, but uses dimensionless integers k and n to count the discrete units of space and time. The trajectory of the fictuous random walker (the sequence of integer 'positions' Xn) is determined by the initial position X0 (usually unimportant) and the sequence of steps, or differences νn = Xn - Xn - 1. These steps νn only take two possible values - 1 and + 1 and can thus be called sign factors. Since the probabilty of each sign depends only on the directly preceeding one, a discrete correlated random walk is a Markov chain. It is therefore easy to show that for a given persistence probability q, the autocorrelation function of νn is given by

[formula]

Since the resulting statistical properties of the CDTRW model have been derived analytically in Ref.[\cite=hanneken98], we just repeat the main results here. The displacement distribution for a DTCRW with persistence parameter q is given by

[formula]

where n and k must either both be even or both be odd. It has additionally been assumed that initially (at time step t   =   0) the probablity for the particle to go left or right are equal. Note that P(k,n) = 0 for |k| > n. The corresponding mean squared displacement, defined as the second moment of P(k,n  |  q), is given by

[formula]

The CDTRW with physical dimensions

In order to relate the CDTRW model to an actual measured time series, it is neccessary to associate the integers k and n with physical quantities (having dimensions) by defining xk = k  δx and tn = n  δt. Then, the 'physical' displacement distribution is given by

[formula]

Displacement probabilities for Δx and Δt that are not integer multiples of δx and δt can be obtained by interpolation (compare Fig.[\ref=fig:swdQ09]).

The physical mean squared is given by

[formula]

Again, function values for non-integer multiples of δt can be interpolated.

Scaling of the persistence probability

Consider a correlated random walk A with a persistence parameter [formula]. We seek to construct another walk B that after s  ·  n steps has the same correlations as A after n steps. We therefore require

[formula]

Inserting Eq.([\ref=css]) and solving for the unknown persistence parameter [formula] of walk B yields [formula]. In the case of persistence parameters [formula] we can write (2q - 1)n as ( - 1)n|2q - 1|n and perform an analogous calculation. As a result, we obtain a scaling rule for the persistence parameter:

[formula]

where the sign +   (-  ) has to be used if q > 1 / 2 (q < 1 / 2). This transformation has no effect on uncorrelated walks with q = 0.5. Persistent walks with q > 0.5 become even more persistent. Anti-persistent walks with q < 0.5 become even more anti-persistent (compare Fig.[\ref=fig:flux]).

Scaling of the step length

While the above transformation of the persistence probability ensures that the orignal walk A and the rescaled walk B have equivalent autocorrelation functions, this does not automatically guarantee equivalence of the mean squared displacements. In order to achive the latter point, the step length has to be rescaled as well. For this purpose, note that for lagtimes Δt much longer than the correlation time, the mean squared displacement behaves like that of a diffusive process and is given by [formula]. To match the assymptotic values of the two walks, we therefore require

[formula]

As a result, we obtain an additional scaling law for the step length:

[formula]

Summary and Examples

We thereby have obtained two coupled scaling relations for the persistent probability and the step length: When the time step of a CDTRW is changed from δt to δt / s, the new walk will have equivalent statistical properties if its parameter pair (q,δx) is changed to [formula], with the scaling functions [formula] and g(q,s) as defined above (For an example, see Fig.[\ref=fig:flux2d]).

We have tested the scaling relations by directly comparing the displacement distributions and the mean squared displacements for an original walk with sampling time δt = 1 and a properly scaled walk with δt = 1 / 10. The results are shown in Fig.[\ref=fig:swdAB].
