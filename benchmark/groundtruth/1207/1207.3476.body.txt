Conductance for the two dimensional discrete random Schrödinger operator with small disorder

Introduction

In 1958 P.W. Anderson [\cite=And1958] suggested that sufficiently large impurities in a semi-conductor could lead to spatial localization of electrons, called Anderson localization. The field has grown into a rich theory and is studied by both, the physics and the mathematics community.

We consider the discrete random Schrödinger operator on the integer lattice of dimension two [formula] and assume that the random variables ωi are independent identically distributed with uniform distribution in

[formula]

Key steps of the new approach

Connection with the scaling parameter and existence of extended states

We explain how the delocalization result described in Section [\ref=s-setup] implies the existence of extended states in the sense of the Thouless criterion.

The numerator < mk,δ11  >   in formula [\eqref=e-dinfty] is precisely the (1,1) - entry of the vector mk, while the denominator is the total energy of Hkωδ00 after successive orthogonalization (we only consider the new information of each state).

Roughly speaking, the numerator is small often precisely if the Heisenberg time is large, i.e. it takes a long time to return to the same finite region. And if much of the energy of the state mk is located away from the origin, then the Thouless time is small.

In the case of small c, Figure [\ref=f-energy2] (see [\cite=Exp]) shows that most of the energy of mk is located 'away' from the origin almost surely. In particular, < mk,δ11  >   is small often and mk is relatively large for all k. Indeed, a large part of the energy is almost surely located on the outermost diamond which the orthogonalization process leaves unchanged. In particular, the norm [formula] remains comparably large. This implies that the Heisenberg time is large and the Thouless time is small, yielding a scaling parameter > 1 and the existence of extended states (in the physicists' sense), i.e. conductance of electrons. As was mentioned above, our method of computing a lower estimate of Dω,c also indicates dynamical delocalization and hence the existence of extended states (in the mathematical sense meaning states that do not decay exponentially, and even absolutely continuous spectrum).

As the disorder increases, Figure [\ref=f-energy2] shows that a larger part of the energy remains near the origin, so that < mk,δ11  >   is away from zero more often and the ratio [formula] is generally larger than for small c. However, in this case a large part of the energy remains near the origin. The Euclidean norm [formula] in the denominator of [\eqref=e-dinfty] has little to do with the Thouless time. Therefore, the relationship between the ratio in formula [\eqref=e-dinfty] and the scaling parameter is not directly obvious. This is in agreement with the fact that our new method cannot be used to show localization.
