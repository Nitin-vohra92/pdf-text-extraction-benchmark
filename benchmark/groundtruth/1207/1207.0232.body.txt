The Median Largest Prime Factor

Introduction

The median largest prime factor of the integers in the interval [formula], which we denote by M(x), has size

[formula]

This result first appeared in 1974 in a paper by Selfridge and Wunderlich [\cite=WunderlichSelfridgeMedian]. Martin asked [\cite=MartinPrimeQuestion] how the median prime factor compares to [formula], and whether we have

For sufficiently large x, [formula].

Each inequality [formula] and [formula] holds for arbitrarily large x,y.

For sufficiently large x, [formula].

In this paper we prove that

[formula]

where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. As [formula], it follows that option 1 holds. Our main theorem is stronger than this with an error term like that of the prime number theorem, from which we may obtain an asymptotic expansion for M(x).

For every ε > 0,

[formula]

where [formula], and Oε means the constant is allowed to depend on ε.

The function [formula] admits an asymptotic expansion with coefficients expressible as sums of the Stieltjes constants.

For any integer k, we have the asymptotic expansion

[formula]

where [formula], and γk denotes the kth Stieltjes.

Using the Taylor expansion for ez around z = 0 along with the above proposition, it follows that

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we are able to deduce equation [\ref=eq:M(x)_asymptotic] as a corollary of theorem [\ref=thm:_Median_prime_factor_precise]. Applying the same approach with more terms, it follows that M(x) has an asymptotic expansion of the form

[formula]

where the di are computable constants.

Our proof of theorem [\ref=thm:_Median_prime_factor_precise] is elementary, and uses an application of the hyperbola method. In section [\ref=sec:The-Mean-of-Omega], we use theorem [\ref=thm:_Median_prime_factor_precise] to strengthen a result of Diaconis [\cite=Diaconis1976], and prove that

[formula]

From this, we can recover Diaconis' asymptotic expansion of [formula] by applying proposition [\ref=prop:_li_f_expansion]. In section [\ref=sec:Integers-Without-Large-Prime-Factors], we use the work of DeBruijn [\cite=DeBruijn1951] and Saias [\cite=Saias1989] on integers without large prime factors to give an alternate derivation of theorem [\ref=thm:_Median_prime_factor_precise].

The Main Theorem

For each prime p greater than [formula], there is at most one integer n  ≤  x such that p|n. By the definition of the median largest prime factor, exactly half of the integers in the interval [formula] will be divisible by a prime p > M(x), and since [formula] there will be no double counting. It then follows that

[formula]

where the O(1) term arises since x may not be an even integer. We may split up this sum by writing the floor function as [formula], where [formula] denotes the fractional part of x. Using Mertens formula

[formula]

where [formula], we see that

[formula]

To understand the left hand side of the equation, we need to find a precise asymptotic for the sum of the fractional parts [formula]. The following proposition strengthens a result of De La Vallée Poussin's [\cite=DeLaValleePoussinFractional] where he gave the asymptotic [formula].

We have that

[formula]

Let 1 < B  ≤  x be some integer, and fix ε > 0. Splitting into intervals and rearranging we have that

[formula]

By the prime number theorem this is

[formula]

Using the fact that [formula], the main term is

[formula]

and hence since [formula] by [\ref=eq:Mertens_Formula], we have that

[formula]

The proposition follows by choosing [formula] and noting that we can extend the sum and integral to start at 2 as [formula] and [formula]

Combining proposition [\ref=prop:frac(x/p)_proposition] with equation [\ref=eq:M(x)_functional_equation], we have

[formula]

since

[formula]

Rearranging the equation, we find that

[formula]

and we are able to turn the error term into an additive factor since

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

and by using [\ref=eq:error_multiplicative_to_additive] again, we obtain equation [\ref=eq:M(x)_full_asymptotic], proving theorem [\ref=thm:_Median_prime_factor_precise].

The Function [formula]

To prove proposition [\ref=eq:li_f_expansion], we begin by truncating the interval of integration to obtain

[formula]

Substituting u = x / t, we may write

[formula]

Expanding the geometric series

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

The last term contributes an error of the form [formula], and since we may bound the integral

[formula]

it follows that by [\ref=eq:li_f_giant_equation] and [\ref=eq:li_f_proof_equation] we have

[formula]

To evaluate the constants explicitly, we will make use of the Laurent expansion of ζ(s) which is given by

[formula]

where the γn are the Stieltjes Constants, and γ0 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. We will also make use of the identity

[formula]

which holds for for [formula], [formula] [\cite=MontVaughn2007]. Letting

[formula]

we have the following lemma:

For any integer [formula],

[formula]

Consider the generating series

[formula]

By [\ref=eq:zeta_for_s>0], this equals [formula], and so from equation [\ref=eq:laurent_expansion] we have

[formula]

and the result follows upon comparing coefficients.

The Mean of ω(n) and Ω(n)

Using proposition [\ref=prop:frac(x/p)_proposition], we are able to provide a short proof of the asymptotic expansion of [formula] given in [\cite=Diaconis1976], where ω(n) is the number of distinct prime divisors function. Since [formula], rearranging the orders of summation implies that

[formula]

By [\ref=eq:Mertens_Formula] and proposition [\ref=prop:frac(x/p)_proposition], we deduce equation [\ref=eq:sum_of_omega(n)_diaconis] which states that

[formula]

Combining the previous equation with proposition [\ref=prop:_li_f_expansion] yields Diaconis' [\cite=Diaconis1976] expansion

[formula]

with cn given explicitely as [formula]. We may derive a similar expansion for Ω(n), the number of distinct prime factors counted with multiplicity. Taking into account the higher prime powers, we see that

[formula]

and so

[formula]

where [formula]

Integers Without Large Prime Factors

In this section, we deduce the main result in a different way using the work of DeBruijn [\cite=DeBruijn1951] and Saias [\cite=Saias1989] on integers without large prime factors. Let ψ(x,y) denote the number of integers n with 1  ≤  n  ≤  x, all of whose prime factors are ≤  y. Then the median largest prime factor, M(x), of the integers in the interval
