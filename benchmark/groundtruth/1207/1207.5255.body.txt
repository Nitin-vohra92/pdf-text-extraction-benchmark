Complete metric on mixing actions of general groups

The work was completed in the framework of the Program for Support of Leading Scientific Schools of the Russian Federation (grant no. NS-3038.2008.1)

Introduction

Let A be the group of invertible measure preserving transformations of Lebesgue space [formula], endowed with weak topology(see below). Continuous homomorphism of a topological group G into A is called G-action(or simply, action).

Measure preserving action T of a locally compact group is mixing if for arbitrary measurable sets A and B  ⊂  X

[formula]

if G is finitely generated then one can say about length of its elements, denoted by [formula], and g  →    ∞   iff [formula].

The aim of the paper is to elaborate certain machinery for study of mixing G-actions from the point of view going back to the well-known theorem due to Halmos and Rokhlin about conjugacy class of aperiodic transformation.

This question for [formula]-actions was considered in [\cite=TikhonovMSB2].

Here the general case of countable infinite groups and their actions is considered:

-- the metric on the set of mixing G-actions is introduced so that the corresponding space MG is complete and separable,

-- it is shown that for generic action its conjugates are everywhere dense in this space.

Moreover, if G is finitely generated infinite monotilable amenable group then conjugates to Cartesian product of two free mixing actions are everywhere dense in MG.

The metric

Let [formula] be separable Lebesgue space and [formula] be a countable collection of sets generating the σ-algebra Σ. Measure μ is supposed to be normalized and continuous. All the spaces with these properties are isomorphic to each other; in particular such a space is isomorphic to its Cartesian square. The set A of invertible measure preserving transformations X is separable with respect to weak topology defined by the base of neighbourhoods

[formula]

(here and below q stand for finite subset of [formula]). Moreover A is a topological group (i.e. multiplication and inversion are continuous). The weak topology is generated by any of the metrics

[formula]

and

[formula]

Metric d is more preferable in the sense that the space A is complete with respect to d; it is called metric of weak topology. This metric can be naturally generalized to the case of group actions. Let G be countable group; the set AG of G-actions by measure preserving transformations is a complete separable metric space with respect to metric

[formula]

where [formula] is collection of positive numbers satisfying the condition [formula].

Action T of a group G is called mixing, if for each pair A,B∈Σ, one has

[formula]

as [formula].

The set [formula] of mixing actions of G is endowed by lead metric

[formula]

If [formula] the metric m coincides with complete separable metric introduced in [\cite=TikhonovMSB2]. Metric [formula] can be considered on the set AG, however it is not separable (even in the case [formula]).

Metrics m and [formula] generate in [formula] the same topology with the base of neighbourhoods

[formula]

where T∈, [formula] is finite and [formula].

Coincidence of topologies follows from the fact that metrics d and a generate the same topology (see [\cite=TikhonovMSB2]). Now we show that sets [formula] form a base of topology generated by w.

1. In every [formula]-neighbourhood of the action T there is a neighbourhood [formula], where q is such that [formula]. In fact, one has

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Since this is true for any g,

[formula]

2. In every set [formula] there is [formula]-neighbourhood of T, where l is the maximal number of elements from q. Then for Ai,Aj∈q, one has

[formula]

[formula]

Hence for each S such that [formula], every pair A,B∈q and every g∈G the inequality

[formula]

holds and therefore [formula].

The space [formula] is separable.

It is sufficient to show that for each finite [formula] and arbitrary ε > 0 one can choose the countable sets of actions [formula] such that the space [formula] has a covering by the sets [formula].

For every mixing G-action T there is a finite collection of parameters defined as follows:

n is a positive integer such that

[formula]

[formula] is the collection of positive integers such that

[formula]

The set of these parameters is countable. If actions T and S have the same parameter collections then for each pair A,B∈q, one has

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Hence [formula] and the required countable set of actions can be formed by choosing one action for each of the constructed parameter collections.

[formula] is a complete separable metric space.

By virtue of the previous lemma it remains to check completeness. Let [formula] be a Cauchy sequence with respect to m. Then it is also Cauchy in the space [formula] and converges in [formula] to some G-action T. In addition Tgi  →  Tg for every g∈G. Since [formula] it is sufficient to check that T is mixing and

[formula]

Let [formula] be such that for any l,m > i and every g∈G one has [formula] Now Tgl converges weakly to Tg, so there exists [formula] such that [formula].

It follows that for m > i,

[formula]

Next, for m chosen above and given sets Ai,Aj there is a number k0 such that

[formula]

if [formula].

Now, using the inequality

[formula]

[formula]

one has

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

whence in view of arbitrariness of ε,i and j it follows that T is mixing.

Dense subsets

We call the family of actions

[formula]

conjugacy class of G-action T. The closure of this class in [formula] is denoted by [formula].

For each U∈A the mapping [formula] is continuous.

Consider neighbourhoods [formula] and [formula] of the actions U- 1TU and T respectively.

Then

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The G-action S is a factor of G-action T, if there exists measure preserving mapping v of the space [formula] into itself such that [formula] mod0 for every g∈G.

If S is a factor of T then [formula].

It suffices to check that [formula]. Let v be so that [formula] mod0. Consider a neighbourhood [formula] of the action S and show that in this neighbourhood there is an action of the form U- 1TU for certain U∈A. We take as U any invertible measure preserving transformation of the space [formula] transferring A to v- 1A for each A∈q.

Then for all g∈G, A,B∈q, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The last equality follows from the inclusion v- 1vTgv- 1A  ⊃  Tgv- 1A and the fact that measures of these sets coincide, hence they are equal mod 0 (it is used here that [formula]).

Actions T and S can be approximated arbitrarily well by actions conjugate to T  ×  S.

Subset of metric space has type Gδ if it is countable intersection of open sets. Everywhere dense subset in a complete metric space is called generic. The expression "typical mixing possesses the property P" means that this P hold for generic set of mixing actions.

The set

[formula]

is generic.

Let [formula] be a countable dense subset in [formula]. The set W consists of those mixing actions that can be transferred by conjugation into each of the sets

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Note that all the sets right to the intersection symbol are open. Indeed, [formula] is continuous mapping, hence [formula] -- inverse image of a neighbourhood of the action U- 1SU contains some neighbourhood of S.

It remains to note that conjugacy class for Cartesian product of all Ti's is dense in [formula], since it approaches arbitrarily close to each of Ti's(cor [\ref=cor1]).

Everywhere dense sets of actions for monotilable amenable groups

In the section we consider finitely generated infinite monotilable amenable groups.

Group G is called monotilable amenable, if there exists a sequence [formula] of finite subsets in G, satisfying the following conditions:

1. For every g∈G, one has [formula] as i  →    ∞   (here and then symbol "#  " denotes the number of element in the set);

2. For each [formula], the set Fi is a tile in the sense that there exists a collection [formula] such that [formula].

We recall that an action T is free if the set

[formula]

has measure zero.

The following proposition [\cite=OrnsteinWeiss87] is a group analog of Rokhlin-Halmos lemma.

For arbitrary ε > 0, free G-action Q and a tile G  ⊂  G, there exists a set E such that QgE,g∈G are disjoint and their total measure in not less 1 - ε.

A collection of sets [formula] with E as in lemma [\ref=lem:Alpern] is called Rokhlin tower. To mark that its remainder [formula] has measure at most ε we write [formula].

It follows from lemma [\ref=lem:Alpern] that conjugacy class of any free G-action is everywhere dense in AG.

For any set C  ⊂  G, free G-action Q:Y  →  Y, ε > 0 and a tile F there exist sets G  ⊂  G and E∈Σ such that

1. [formula] for some finite collection [formula],

2. [formula] for g∈C,

3. [formula],

4. [formula] is a tower.

From lemma [\ref=lem:Alpern] and the properties of monotilable amenable groups it follows that there exist tile [formula] and set E such that [formula], [formula] for [formula] and [formula] is a tower.

Consider now an infinite sequence [formula] with the property [formula] and take as [formula] the set [formula]. The set [formula] possesses properties 1-4 above.

Property 1 holds by construction of G.

Further,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

whence

[formula]

This estimate gives properties 3 and 4.

For g∈C one has

[formula]

[formula]

For arbitrary finite subsets I,H  ⊂  G there exists an infinite collection [formula] such that for every i

[formula]

if g∈I.

Let H1  ⊂  G be an infinite subset. If there are no g∈I such that [formula] for infinitely many h∈H1 then the collection

[formula]

is a required one. Otherwise there exist g1∈I with infinitely many inclusions [formula], h∈H1, and an infinite subset F1  ⊂  H1 such that

[formula]

for all f1,i,f1,j∈F1. Hence every h∈H2: = F1F- 11 commutes with g1 and thus

[formula]

If for every [formula] inclusion [formula] does not hold for infinitely many h∈H2, then

[formula]

is the required collection. In the case there exists [formula] with infinitely many inclusions [formula], h∈H2, one can choose an infinite subset F2  ⊂  H2 such that

[formula]

for all pairs f2,i,f2,j∈F2. Hence every h∈H3: = F2F- 12 commutes with g1 and g2.

Doing so we either obtain the required collection or some infinite set Hn in the centralizer of [formula]. If the set

[formula]

is finite then [formula] is a required collection. Otherwise there exist [formula] with infinitely many inclusions [formula], h∈Hn and an infinite subset Fn  ⊂  Hn such that

[formula]

for all pairs fn,i,fn,j∈Fn. Hence every h∈Hn + 1: = FnF- 1ncommutes with [formula].

Either this inductive procedure stops (whence the lemma is already proved) or infinite set H#  I + 1 (obtained as the result of the procedure) is in the centralizer of I whence H#  I + 1 is a required collection.

Let [formula] be an increasing sequence of finite subsets in G, satisfying conditions:

[formula]

for all i and

[formula]

for [formula].

Then for arbitrary collection [formula] and fixed g∈G, there are at most 2 solutions of the inclusion

[formula]

Assume that

[formula]

Let l be the maximal of the indices i,j,k,l (other variants are considered similarly).

One has inclusions

[formula]

and glg- 1i∈C0gkg- 1gg- 1jC0 = C0gkg- 1jC0 whence gl∈C0gkg- 1jC0gi. If [formula], then [formula] in contradiction with the choice of gl.

Hence either l = i or l = j. If l = i, one has gj∈C- 10gig, and on the other hand gk∈C- 10gig, it follows, that gjg- 1k∈C- 10C0, whence k = j in view of the choice of a sequence [formula]. The case l = j is considered similarly and in this case k = i. Thus besides [formula] another solution of inclusion gigg- 1j∈C0 may be [formula].

Now for convenience reasons we introduce some notations. Inequality [formula] will be written as proximity [formula].

If an action S is fixed, A,B∈Σ, f,g,h∈G we write

[formula]

For ε > 0,mixing G-action S, finite F  ⊂  G and finite r  ⊂  Σ there exists an infinite subset [formula] such that given h,f∈F, arbitrary A,B∈r and g∈G, the proximity

[formula]

holds for all pairs [formula], i  ≠  j, except at most two.

Moreover there is finite C  ⊂  G such that given h,f∈F arbitrary A,B∈r and [formula], the proximity

[formula]

holds for all i, except at most one.

Let N be such that

[formula]

for any A,B∈r. Take [formula] as C and set [formula]. One has that g∉H implies the proximities

[formula]

and moreover C = C- 1.

The required sequence [formula] and auxiliary sequence of subsets Ci  ⊂  G, gi∈Ci, will be constructed inductively.

We set C0 = H and let g1 be an arbitrary element outside C50. As C1 may be taken finite set, containing g1, C50 and invariant with respect to inversion g  →  g- 1.

Let [formula] and Cn - 1 are already chosen. Applying lemma [\ref=lem:knmn] to the sets H and [formula] choose elements [formula]. Next as gn take a arbitrary element of set [formula], and then as Cn take arbitrary finite set, containing gn, C5n - 1 and invariant with respect to inversion.

This inductive procedure results in the increasing sequence of finite sets [formula] and infinite sequence of elements [formula].

According to lemma [\ref=lem:gi] given k one has g- 1jkgi∉C0 = H for all (except at most 2) pairs [formula]. Hence proximity ([\ref=eq:4]) follows from ([\ref=eq:1234]) and the first conclusion of the claim is checked.

As regards the second conclusions of the claim we show that [formula]. In fact, if g- 1ikgi∈H then for every n > i one has k∈In according to the choice of In. Since [formula] it follows (from lemma [\ref=lem:knmn]) that [formula]. Finally, k∉H⇐g∉C.

Now application of proximity in ([\ref=eq:1234]) finishes the proof.

Construction of the special G-action

Fix two free mixing G-actions S:X  →  X and Q:Y  →  Y, collection of sets r  ⊂  Σ, Rokhlin tower [formula], finite subsets [formula] in G, such, that [formula]. Take an invertible measure-preserving mapping V:X  ↦  X  ×  Y so that A  ×  Y for every A∈r. Set [formula] where the transformation J is given by the formulas

[formula]

and

[formula]

for all ci and all f∈F (recall that O denotes the remainder of the tower [formula]).

Z is called a special action.

Remark that for arbitrary A,B∈r, g∈G and an action T one has

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Using notations ([\ref=eq:obozn]), this inequality can be written in the form

[formula]

The formula enables one to estimate the distance between G-action T and special action Z.

Let G be finitely generated monotilable amenable group. For any free mixing G-actions S and Q one has [formula].

Given G-action T and positive number Δ, we show that in [formula]-neighbourhood of T there is an action conjugate to S  ×  Q.

First choose collection of measurable sets r and ε > 0 so that

[formula]

Next fix a finite set H  ⊂  G satisfying proximity

[formula]

for all A,B∈r, g∉H and choose a tile F so that [formula] for g∈H.

Passing to conjugate action one can assume that

[formula]

for every g∈F (see remark after lemma [\ref=lem:Alpern]).

Using the previous claim choose corresponding elements [formula] and set C. Next by Q,F,C and ε choose sets G  ⊂  G,E  ⊂  Y and sequence [formula] as in lemma [\ref=lemm:alpern2].

Let Z be the special action corresponding to the parameters obtained above. To show that [formula] we use inequality ([\ref=eq:Glavn]).

Given A,B∈r and g∈G let a quadruple [formula] be called 'bad' if

[formula]

(remember notations k,,f). The points of [formula] are called 'bad' if the corresponding quadruple [formula] is 'bad'.

We now estimates the measure of 'bad' points in the cases: [formula].

1. Let g∈H. If in the first case h,gh∈F then the set Qghci is of the form Qfcj hence i = j, f = gh. Since k = e one has

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, only the points of those [formula] may be 'bad' for which gh∉F. Measure of corresponding set does not exceed the ratio [formula] which is less than ε by the choice of F.

2. Let [formula]. If a quadruple [formula] is such that h,gh∈F then all the points of [formula] are not 'bad' (as above). Given a quadruple [formula] such that h∈F, [formula] one has i  ≠  j and according to claim [\ref=utv1] given f, h and all pairs [formula], except at most 2

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, only the points of those [formula] may be 'bad' for which either ghci∉G or the pairs [formula] are exceptional. In the first case measure of corresponding set does not exceed the ratio [formula] which is less than ε according to conclusion 2 of lemma [\ref=lemm:alpern2]. In the second case measure of the set of 'bad' points does not exceed

[formula]

where J = J(f,h) is the set of exceptional pairs [formula]. Since [formula] this measure can be estimated as follows

[formula]

3. Assume that g∉C. According to claim for fixed f,h and all pairs [formula], except at most 3 one has

[formula]

[formula]

Hence the points of [formula] are not 'bad'.

Measure of the set of 'bad' points in this case does not exceed

[formula]

where J = J(f,h) is the set of exceptional pairs. Since [formula], for the total measure of 'bad' points can be estimated by

[formula]

So the right hand side in ([\ref=eq:Glavn]) does not exceed the total measure of 'bad' points plus 2ε one has that for all g

[formula]

does not exceed 6ε.

Let G be finitely generated infinite monotilable group. Then for every Bernoulli action of this group conjugates are everywhere dense in MG.

In fact theorem [\ref=thm:Decart_ploten] can be applied since Bernoulli G-action are Cartesian squares (see [\cite=OrnsteinWeiss87]).

Let G be finitely generated infinite monotilable group. For every free mixing G-action of positive entropy its conjugates are everywhere dense in MG.

It follows from lemma [\ref=lem:factorDence] and the fact that free G-action of positive entropy possesses a Bernoulli factor [\cite=OrnsteinWeiss87].

Concluding remark

1. Resides weak and lead metrics in the set of G-actions one can introduce mixed metrics. For example, metrics

[formula]

is complete and separable when considered in the set of G-actions T with mixing Tg. Such a metric was used in [\cite=TSVMSB2011] for constructing of mixing transformations of homogeneous spectral multiplicity n > 2.

2. The lead metrics may be introduced for actions of locally compact groups. In the case

[formula]

where [formula] is a increasing to G sequence of compact sets.
