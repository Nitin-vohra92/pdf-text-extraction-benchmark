Nilpotency of Elementary Operators on B(E)

Introduction

Let B(E) be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Banach space E, and let [formula] and [formula] be two n-tuples of operators in B(E). The elementary operator RA,B associated with A and B is the operator on B(E) into itself defined by

[formula]

for all X∈B(E) (see [\cite=FIAL]).

For A and B in B(E), by MA,B we denote elementary multiplication operator defined by MA,B(X)  =  AXB for all X∈B(E). This can also be seen as elementary operator of length one. For A,B∈B(E), inner derivation δA on B(E) into itself is defined by δA(X)  =  AX  -  XA and generalized derivation δA,B on B(E) into itself is defined by δA,B(X)  =  AX  -  XB for all X∈B(E). It is easy to see that generalized derivation and inner derivation are particular cases of elementary operators.

In 1979, Fong and Sourour [\cite=FS] investigated the compactness of elementary operators. By using that result they gave the following characterization of nilpotency of generalized derivations.

[\cite=FS] Let X be an infinite dimensional Banach space and S,T∈B(X), then the following are equivalent:

δS,T is nilpotent.

There exist a positive integer n such that δnS,T is a compact operator.

There exist a scaler λ such that S - λI and T - λI are nilpotent.

Results

In this section,we shall give a necessary and sufficient condition for nilpotency of elementary operators and give some sufficient conditions for elementary operators to be nilpotent.

The elementary multiplication operator MA,B(X)  =  AXB for all X∈B(E), is nilpotent if and only if either A or B is nilpotent.

We have MA,B(X)  =  AXB for all X∈B(E) so MnA,B(X)  =  AnXBn. It is easy to see that MA,B is nilpotent if either A or B is nilpotent.

Conversely, let MnA,B  =  0. Now MnA,B(X)  =  AnXBn  =  0 for all X∈B(E). If B is nilpotent then theorem is done otherwise Bnz  ≠  0 for some z∈E. By consequence of Hahn - Banach theorem there exist a linear functional f such that f(Bnz)  ≠  0. Let [formula] be rank one operator on E defined by ([formula], where x is a nonzero vector in E (see [\cite=MUR]).

Now

[formula]

If we vary x throughout E, then Anx  =  0 for all x∈E. Hence A is nilpotent.

Let RA,B be an elementary operator on B(E), where [formula] and [formula] are n-tuples of commuting families in B(E). Then RA,B is nilpotent if either Ai or Bi is nilpotent for each 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

We denote [formula] for all X∈B(E).

For n = 1, RA,B is an elementary multiplication operator. Therefore statement is true by Theorem 2.1

Suppose statement is true for n  =  m.

Now we show that statement is true for n  =  m  +  1 also.

Let

[formula]

Suppose [formula] and MAm + 1,Bm  +  1(X)  =  Am  +  1XBm  +  1. It follows that RA,B  =  RA,B'  +   MAm  +  1,Bm  +  1. Since Ai  's and Bi  's are commuting, it is easy to see that RA,B'MAm  +  1,Bm  +  1  =  MAm  +  1,Bm  +  1RA,B'. But RA,B' and MAm  +  1,Bm  +  1 are nilpotent. Therefore [formula] is nilpotent.

Let VA,B(X)  =  AXB  -  BXA be an elementary operator on B(H) into itself, where AB  =  BA. If there exist [formula], such that A  -  λI and B  -  μI are nilpotent then VA,B is nilpotent.

We have VA,B(X)  =  AXB  -  BXA. It is easy to see that

[formula]

Since A - λI and B - μI are nilpotent, δA and δB are nilpotent follows by Theorem 1.1. Further δAδB  =  δBδA. Therefore λδB  -  μδA is nilpotent. Note that VA  -  λI,B  -  μI is nilpotent by Theorem 2.2. Since AB  =  BA, it is easy to see that

VA  -  λI,B  -  μI(μδA  -  λδB)  =  (μδA  -  λδB)VA  -  λI,B  -  μI. Therefore from equation ([\ref=eq:one]) VA,B  =  VA  -  λI,B  -  μI  +  μδA  -  λδB is nilpotent.

examples

Let [formula] be the complex algebra of all 2  ×  2 matrices and let

[formula], [formula].

Note that AB  ≠  BA, A2  =  B2  =  0, ABA  =  A and BAB  =  B. Consider VA,B(X)  =  AXB  -  BXA, we get V3A,B  =    -  VA,B.But [formula] is a diagonal operator for every [formula], where [formula]. Therefore V3A,B  =    -  VA,B  ≠  0. Hence VA,B is not nilpotent.

Above example shows that commutativity of A and B cannot be relaxed in Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3.

Let [formula] be the complex algebra of all 3  ×  3 matrices. Suppose [formula] and [formula] such that a  +  b  =  c  +  d  =  k  ≠  0,b  +  c  ≠  0.

Note that AB  =  BA and N  =  A - B is nilpotent. Consider VA,B(X)  =  AXB  -  BXA, we have VA,B(X)  =  NXB  -  BXN. Thus VA,B is nilpotent by Theorem 2.2 but none of A or B is nilpotent. This shows that condition of Theorem 2.1 cannot be extended to elementary operators of length 2. This example also shows that converse of Theorem 2.2 is not true. Further note that A  -  λI and B  -  μI are not nilpotent for any λ,μ∈C. This shows that converse of Theorem 2.3 is not true.
