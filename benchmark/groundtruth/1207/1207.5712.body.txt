Finding msr of a given graph of at most seven vertices by giving vector representations

{

Introduction

Given a connected graph G with n vertices, we associate to G a set H(G) of Hermitian n  ×  n matrices by the following way,

[formula]

where [formula] is the complex conjugate of A and aij is the ij-entry of A. We define P(G) be the subset of H(G) whose members are positive semidefinite matrices. For a given graph G, P(G) is non-empty because laplacian matrix L(G)∈P(G). Define

[formula]

To introduce the result of this paper, we need the following preparation.

An induced subgraph H of a graph G is obtained by deleting all vertices except for the vertices in a subset S. For a graph G, we consider its �tree size,� denoted ts(G), which is the number of vertices in a maximum induced tree.

[\cite=BH] If H is an induced subgraph of a connected graph G, then msr(H)  ≤  msr(G).

Given a simple connected graph G, we can define the tree size ts(G) of G. It is known that for a tree T, msr(T) = ts(T) - 1. Hence by Lemma [\ref=lemma21],we get ts(G) - 1  ≤  msr(G).

[\cite=BH] If a simple connected graph G has a pendant vertex v, which is simply vertex of degree 1, then msr(G) = msr(G - v) + 1.

Finding msr by giving vector representations

Suppose G is a connected graph with vertex set [formula] We call a set of vectors [formula] in [formula] a vector representation (or orthogonal representation) of G if for [formula] [formula] whenever i and j are adjacent in G and [formula] whenever i and j are not adjacent in G. For any matrix B, [formula] is a semi-definite positive matrix and [formula]. For any semi-definite positive matrix A, there exists a matrix B such that [formula] and [formula]

For a large family of graphs, [\cite=BH] has given a good way to get msr. But [\cite=BH] did not give the msr problem completely. In this section we solve the msr for graphs with at most seven vertices but does not satisfies the conditions of graphs in [\cite=BH]. For the readers convenience, we list all these graphs here: G706, G710, G817, G836, G864, G867, G870, G872, G876, G877, G946, G954, G955, G979, G982, G992, G997 - G1000, G1003 - G1007, G1053, G1056, G1060, G1065, G1069, G1084, G1089 - G1097, G1100, G1101, 1104, G1105, G1123, G1125, G1135, G1145, G1146, G1148, G1149, G1152 - G1157, G1159, G1160, G1165, G1167, G1168, G1170, G1176, G1179, G1189, G1191, G1194 - G1197 G1199, G1200, G1202, G1205, G1207 - G1212, G1222, G1224, G1228, G1230, G1231, G1233, G1241, G1242, G1248, G1250. We give the msr of all those graphs by finding the vector representations.

In the following examples, for vectors vi and vj, by abusing notations, we write 〈vi,vj〉 = vi  ·  vj. If vi  ·  vj = 0, then we write [formula]

The tree size of G706 is 5. First let's show msr(G706) > 4. Let {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7} be a vector representation of G706. It follows that [formula] [formula] [formula] and [formula] Hence [formula] Otherwise v6  ·  v7 = 0. Similarly, [formula] Otherwise v2  ·  v4 = 0. Similarly,[formula] Otherwise v3 = 0. If the msr(G706) is 4 , we get [formula] It follows that v1 = 0. This is a contradiction.

If v4,v5,v6 are linearly independent, then [formula] Hence v2  ·  v3 = 0. This is a contradiction. Hence v4,v5,v6 are linearly dependent. We know v4 and v5 are linearly independent because [formula] and v3  ·  v5 = 0. It follows that [formula] It follows that v6  ·  v7 = 0. This is a contradiction.

Let v = {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7} be a representation of G1233. It follows that [formula] [formula] If msr(G1233) = 2, then [formula] We know that v4  ·  v6  =  0. This leads a contradiction.
