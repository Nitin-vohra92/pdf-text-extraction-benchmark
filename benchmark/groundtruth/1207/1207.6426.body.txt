Abstract

The Kompaneets theory of photon kinetic evolution due to the Compton effect is extended to the case of the Vlasov plasma wave oscillations. Taking into account Zel'dovich-Levich's approximation we study interaction of accumulating photons with plasma in the long wavelength limit.

Introduction

To consider the role of the Compton scattering of quanta on non-relativistic electrons, Kompaneets proposed [\cite=KO] the following kinetic equation for the photon-number distribution function [formula] in a unit volume:

[formula]

where [formula], and the integrand is the photon density for a given energy ω and time t. Here f0(ε) is the Maxwell distribution function for temperature Te of free electrons, ε = p2 / (2m); dW is the differential photon transition probability from one state into another due to scattering with electrons. In this equation, emission and absorption processes have not been taken into account, so that the transitions are produced exclusively by Compton scattering processes. It is easy to check that in stationary case [formula] the solution is the Planck distribution: [formula]. Kompaneets considered the non relativistic case, i.e., it was assumed that the inequality kT  ≪  mc2 holds. Introducing a new variable ω / kT = x and notation [formula] he got from ([\ref=a1]) in approximation [formula]:

[formula]

After introduction of dimensionless time parameter t1 = (mc2 / kT)(l / c)t, where l is the Compton range determined by the total cross section 8πe2 / (3mc2), and calculation of integrals in ([\ref=a11]), Kompaneets obtained the following equation:

[formula]

Later Zel'dovich and Levich [\cite=ZL] found solution of Eq. ([\ref=kz1]) in the limit [formula] (high-temperature regime) and [formula], since in this regime Eq. ([\ref=kz1]) reduces to the inviscid Burgers' equation:

[formula]

They showed that in the absence of absorption the photons undergo a kind of Bose condensation in the energy space in the vicinity of zero. This kinetic condensation depends essentially on the form of the initial photon distribution. For a certain form of initial distribution, a shock-wave as a function of photon energy occurs in the course of its dynamics. The process is extremely non-uniform across the frequency spectrum and substantially affected by absorption. Using the method of characteristics Zel'dovich and Levich have found solution of Eq. ([\ref=z1]) in the following form:

[formula]

Here F is determined by the initial condition for Eq. ([\ref=z1]). According to Eqs. ([\ref=z1])-([\ref=z2]) all points on the initial curve [formula] move along characteristic straight lines parallel to the x-axis in the direction of decreasing x with velocity proportional to [formula]. The time at which a given point reaches dimensionless energy x = 0 is determined by the expression [formula]. Considering a special case of initial condition, which corresponds to the Planck distribution [formula] with Tph > Te, one obtains for solution ([\ref=z2]):

[formula]

in the frequency region which corresponds to large occupation number, i.e., for x <  < 1.

Vlasov plasma oscillations After this preliminaries we consider plasma consisting of charged particles with positions [formula] and momenta [formula] moving in [formula]. The Vlasov equation [\cite=AAVl] for the particle distribution function (plasma density) [formula] is

[formula]

Here U is an external potential and [formula] is an electrostatic self-consistent plasma potential which is defined by [formula], where [formula]. Let us present the eventual solution of ([\ref=a2]) in the following perturbational form

[formula]

where [formula] is the space homogeneous Maxwell distribution for electrons. Then the fluctuating electrostatic field can be written as

[formula]

From Eq. ([\ref=a4]) we see that [formula] and f* are of the same order. In what follows, we use the velocities [formula] instead of the momenta. Then using the form of Eq. ([\ref=a3]) we get the linearized Vlasov equation of the order O(μ)

[formula]

Here

[formula]

To be specific consider plasma oscillations propagating in [formula]-direction:

[formula]

In particular we are interested the case of the long wave-length limit for λ = 2π / k. Then following Kvasnikov [\cite=Vl], we get from Eqs. ([\ref=a6]) in this limit (k  →  0):

[formula]

Here ω0 is Langmuir frequency. For the photon density we look for the representation which is a perturbation of the Kompaneets solution by the Vlasov oscillations:

[formula]

Here [formula] is the solution of Kompaneets equation ([\ref=kz1]). To proceed further we return to Eq. ([\ref=a1]) for the distribution function of photons, but instead of the Maxwell function distribution for the electrons, we consider the perturbed solution ([\ref=a3]), where f* is the solution of Vlasov equation ([\ref=a5]). Then we obtain for unknown function n*(x,t1), the following linearized equation:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=b2]) is a linear parabolic equation with non-constant coefficients. Nevertheless, one can find solutions in some special cases. Consider them only for some partial case when the "shift" term ∂n *   /  ∂x and the "force" which proportional to n* are much smaller than the diffusion term. Then

[formula]

In the framework of the Zel'dovich - Levich approximation [formula] and [formula], it is straightforward to find that [formula], where [formula] has the form ([\ref=z3]). To find solution of Eq. ([\ref=b6]), let us change variables: z =  -  ln x, τ = t1, and [formula]. Then the equation for [formula] takes the form

[formula]

After the second change of variables: [formula], we get for ν(z,τ) diffusion equation:

[formula]

The solution of Eq. ([\ref=d2]) is

[formula]

where A = el / (ω0kTc). To calculate integral ([\ref=d3]) we consider [formula] in the following two limit cases (0 < x < 1):

The first one is the case of small times t1 < 1 / 2 + x / 4. Then it is straightforward to show that [formula], and [formula]. For simplicity let us consider the Zel'dovoch-Levich approximation, when [formula]. Then one obtains [formula]. Remark: In this approximation the last formula for [formula] manifest a singularity at t1 = 1 / 2. Zel'dovich and Levich have mentioned that a kind of photon Bose condensation is occurring just at this moment, see also [\cite=YP], [\cite=gruz]. They have found that it is a minimal critical time in which the photon state with x = 0 starts filling up. For time t1 < 1 / 2 one obtains from ([\ref=d3]) the solution of Eq. ([\ref=b6]):

[formula]

For the second limit case, t  ≫  1, one gets [formula] with Φ(v1,x,t1) = 4A sin ω0t1. Then

[formula]

We notice that, in contrast to the first case, the behavior the photon distribution when x goes to zero is different from the Planck distribution. It is in fact a dominant contribution as x approaches zero.

Conclusion

We found the photon function distribution perturbed by the Compton scattering in plasma is:

[formula]

We have shown that the solution exhibited by Zel'dovitch-Levich might be unstable at sufficiently large times around x = 0 where photon Bose condensation occurs. This instability is generated by the diffusion term in the equation for the perturbation of the photon density by plasma wave oscillations.
