Conclusion and future directions

In overall, as it was expected, shadowing is a property that allows us to go further than weak shadowing. However, surprisingly, does not take us as far as we would expect when compared to weak shadowing. In fact, in low dimensions, the C1-stability of the shadowing property implies global hyperbolicity exactly as the C1-stability of the weak shadowing property. Moreover, even in the multidimensional case, both properties share several properties, because both avoid the presence of singularities (for flows), both display a dominated splitting in the whole manifold and both have a hyperbolic behavior; the shadowing have hyperbolicity and the weak shadowing volume-hyperbolicity.

We believe that the techniques developed in the present paper should be useful to prove that volume-preserving dynamical systems which exhibits C1-shadowing-like properties display a weak form of hyperbolicity. Actually, it is our guess that the results in [\cite=AR] can be generalized not only for our class but also for dissipative flows in higher dimensions. Thus, systems with C1-stability of the average shadowing property and also the asymptotic average shadowing property should also have a dominated splitting. Furthermore, the C1-stability of weak shadowing for dissipative flows is not studied yet, and our results should enlighten the solution for that problem.
