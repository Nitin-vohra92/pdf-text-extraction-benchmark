Cuspidal representations of GL(n,F) distinguished by a maximal Levi subgroup, with F a non-archimedean local field

Preliminaries

Let F be nonarchimedean local field. We denote GL(n,F) by Gn for n  ≥  1, and by Nn the unipotent radical of the Borel subgroup of Gn given by upper triangular matrices. For [formula] we denote by Un the group of matrices [formula] for x in Fn - 1.

For n > 1, the map [formula] is an embedding of the group Gn - 1 in Gn, we denote by Pn the subgroup Gn - 1Un of Gn. We fix a nontrivial character θ of (F, + ), and denote by θ again the character [formula] of Nn. The normaliser of θ|Un is then Pn - 1.

When G is an l-group (locally compact totally disconnected group), we denote by Alg(G) the category of smooth complex G-modules. If (π,V) belongs to Alg(G), H is a closed subgroup of G, and χ is a character of H, we denote by δH the positive character of NG(H) such that if μ is a right Haar measure on H, and int is the action given by (int(n)f)(h) = f(n- 1hn), of NG(H) smooth functions f with compact support on H, then [formula] for n in NG(H). If H is a closed subgroup of an l-group G, and (ρ,W) belongs to Alg(H), we define the object (indGH(ρ),Vc = indGH(W)) as follows. The space Vc is the space of smooth functions from G to W, fixed under right translation by the elements of a compact open subgroup Uf of G, satisfying f(hg) = ρ(h)f(g) for all h in H and g in G, and with support compact mod H. The action of G is by right translation on the functions. If f is a function from G to another set, and g belongs to G, we will denote L(g)f:x  ↦  f(g- 1x) and R(g)f:x  ↦  f(xg).

We say that a representation π of G is H-distinguished, if the complex vector space HomH(π,1) is nonzero.

We will use the following functors following [\cite=BZ2]:

The functor Φ+ from Alg(Pk - 1) to Alg(Pk) such that, for π in Alg(Pk - 1), one has [formula].

The functor Ψ+ from Alg(Gk - 1) to Alg(Pk), such that for π in Alg(Gk - 1), one has [formula].

We recall the following proposition, which is a consequence of theorem 4.4 of [\cite=BZ2].

Let π be a cuspidal representation of Gn, then the restriction π|Pn is isomorphic to (Φ+)n - 1Ψ+(1).

The result

Suppose n = p + q, with p  ≥  q  ≥  1, we denote by M(p,q) the standard Levi of Gn given by matrices [formula] with hp∈Gp and hq∈Gq, and by M(p,q - 1) the standard Levi of Gn - 1 given by matrices [formula] with hp∈Gp and hq - 1∈Gq - 1. We denote by M(p - 1,q - 1) the standard Levi of Gn - 2 given by matrices [formula] with hp - 1∈Gp - 1 and hq - 1∈Gq - 1. Let wp,q be the permutation matrix of Gn corresponding to the permutation

[formula]

Let wp,q - 1 be the permutation matrix of Gn - 1 corresponding to the permutation wp,q restricted to [formula]:

[formula]

Let wp - 1,q - 1 be the permutation matrix of Gn - 2 corresponding to the permutation

[formula]

We denote by Hp,q the subgroup wp,qM(p,q)w- 1p,q of Gn, by Hp,q - 1 the subgroup wp,q - 1M(p,q - 1)w- 1p,q - 1 of Gn - 1, and by Hp - 1,q - 1 the subgroup wp - 1,q - 1M(p - 1,q - 1)w- 1p - 1,q - 1 of Gn - 2.

The two following lemmas and propositions are a straightforward adaptation of Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 of [\cite=K].

Denoting by Ln - 1(g) the bottom row of g, one has θ(gu(x)g- 1) = θ(Ln - 1(g).x) for u(x) in Un. Hence θ(gug- 1) = 1 for all u in [formula] if and only if gn - 1,j = 0 for [formula]. It is equivalent to say that g belongs to Pn - 1Hp,q - 1.

Denoting by Ln - 2(g) the bottom row of g, and by u(x) the matrix [formula], sothat θ(gug- 1) = θ(Ln - 2(g).x). Hence θ(gug- 1) = 1 for all u in [formula] if and only if gn - 2,j = 0 for [formula] and [formula]. It is equivalent to say that g belongs to Pn - 2Hp - 1,q - 1.

Let σ belong to Alg(Pn - 1), and χ be a positive character of [formula], then there is a positive character χ' of [formula], such that

[formula]

Let V be the space on which σ acts, and W = φ+V. Let A the projection from C∞c(Pn,V) onto W, defined by [formula]. Lifting through A gives a vector space injection of [formula] into the space of V-distributions T on Pn satisfying relations

[formula]

[formula]

for h0 in [formula] and y0∈Pn - 1Un. We introduce Θ the map on Pn defined by Θ(ug) = θ(u) for u in Un and g in Gn - 1. Then the V-distribution Θ.T is Un-invariant, hence there is a V-distribution S with support in Gn - 1 such that [formula] (where du denotes a Haar measure on Un), and thus [formula] has support [formula]. It is easely verified that [formula] is invariant-Un, but because of relation ([\ref=eq1]), T is invariant-[formula]. We deduce from these two facts that for g in [formula], Θ(gu) must be equal to Θ(g) for any u in [formula]. This means that [formula], and Sp,q = Pn - 1Hp,q - 1 according to Lemma [\ref=lm1], hence T has support in Pn - 1UnHp,q - 1. Now consider the projection [formula], defined by [formula] (which is well defined because of the equality [formula]), and φ  ↦  φ̃ the isomorphism of C∞c(Pn - 1Un  ×  Hp,q - 1,V) defined by φ̃(y,h) = χ(h)δUn(y)3 / 2σ(y)φ(y,h). If one sets D(φ) = T(B(φ̃)), then D is a V-distribution on Pn - 1Un  ×  Hp,q - 1 which is invariant-Pn - 1Un  ×  Hp,q - 1. This implies that there exists a unique linear form λ on V, such that for all [formula]. Now for b in [formula], on has from the integral expression of D, the relation [formula] for some positive modulus character δ. On the other hand, writing D as φ  ↦  T(B(φ̃)), one has [formula] and [formula] for a positive modulus character δ1, sothat [formula]. Comparing the two expressions for [formula], we get the relation [formula], with χ' being the positive character δ- 1δ1χδ3 / 2Un of [formula]. This in turn implies that the linear form λ on V satisfies the same relation, i.e. belongs to [formula], and T  ↦  λ gives a linear injection of [formula] into [formula], and this proves the proposition.

Using Lemma [\ref=lm2] instead of Lemma [\ref=lm1] in the previous proof, one obtains the following statement.

Let σ' belong to Alg(Pn - 2), and χ' be a positive character of [formula], then there is a positive character χ'' of [formula], such that

[formula]

A consequence of these two propositions is the following.

Let n  ≥  3, and p and q two integers with p + q = n and p - 1  ≥  q  ≥  0, then one has [formula].

Using repeatedly the last two propositions, we get the existence of a positive character χ of Pp - q + 1 such that [formula], and this last space is 0 because (Φ+)p - qΨ+(1) and χ are two non isomorphic irreducible representations of Pp - q + 1, according to corollary 3.5 of [\cite=BZ2].

This implies the following theorem about cuspidal representations.

Let π be a cuspidal representation of Gn, which is distinguished by a maximal Levi subgroup M, then n is even and M≃Mn / 2,n / 2.

Let M be the maximal Levi subgroup such that π is M-distinguished. Then M is conjugate to a standard Levi subgroup Mp,q with p  ≥  q and p + q = n. Suppose p  ≥  q + 1, Mp,q is conjugate to Hp,q, sothat π is Hp,q-distinguished, and π|Pn is thus [formula]-distinguished. But by Proposition [\ref=kir], the restriction π|Pn is isomorphic to (Φ+)n - 1Ψ+(1), and this contradicts Proposition [\ref=homzero]. Hence one must have p = q, and this proves the theorem.
