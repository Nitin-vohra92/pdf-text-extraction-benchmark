Split-gate quantum point contacts with tunable channel length

Introduction

A quantum point contact (QPC) is the simplest mesoscopic device that directly shows quantum mechanical properties. It is a short ballistic transport channel between two electron reservoirs, which shows quantized conductance as a function of the width of the channel [\cite=5Wees] [\cite=5Wharam]. A widely applied approach for implementing QPCs is using a split-gate structure on the surface of a heterostructure with a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at about 100 nm beneath its surface. The conventional design of such a split-gate QPC has two metallic gate fingers (Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]a). Operating this device with a negative gate voltage Vg results in the formation of a barrier with a small tunable opening between two 2DEG reservoirs, because the 2DEG below the gate fingers gets depleted over a range that depends on Vg. For electrons in the 2DEG, this appears as an electrostatic potential U that is a large barrier with a small opening in the form of a saddle-point potential (Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]). The saddle-point potential gives transverse confinement in the channel that is roughly parabolic, which results for this transverse direction in a discrete set of electronic energy levels. For electron transport along the channel this gives a discrete set of subbands with one-dimensional character. Quantized conductance appears because each subband contributes G0  =  2e2 / h to the channel's conductance [\cite=5Wees] [\cite=5Wharam], where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant.

We present here the design and experimental characterization of QPCs which offer additional control over the shape of the saddle-point potential. We focused on developing devices for which the effective length of the saddle-point potential (along the transport direction) can be tuned in situ. The additional control is implemented with a symmetric split-gate design based on 6 gate fingers (Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]b). Such devices will be denoted as QPC6F, and conventional devices with 2 gate fingers (Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]a) as QPC2F. These QPC6F are operated with the gate voltage on the outer fingers (Vg2) less negative than the gate voltage on the central fingers (Vg1) to avoid quantum dot formation. Sweeping Vg1 from more to less negative values opens the QPC6F. By co-sweeping Vg2 at fixed ratio Vg2 / Vg1 it behaves as a QPC with a certain length for the saddle-point potential, and this length can be chosen by setting Vg2 / Vg1: It is shortest for Vg2 / Vg1  ≈  0 and longest for [formula]. For our design the effective length could be tuned from about 200 nm to 600 nm.

The motivation for developing these length-tunable QPCs comes from studies of electron many-body effects in QPCs. A well-known manifestation of these many-body effects is the so-called 0.7 anomaly [\cite=5Thomas1996], which is an additional shoulder at 0.7 ~ G0 in quantized conductance traces. These many-body effects are, despite many experimental and theoretical studies since 1996 [\cite=5Review0.7], not yet fully understood. Recent theoretical work [\cite=5Meir] suggested that many-body effects cause the formation of one or more self-consistent localized states in the QPC channel, and that these effects result in the 0.7 anomaly and the other signatures of many-body physics. This theoretical work predicted a clear dependence on the length of the QPC channel, and testing this directly requires experiments where this length is varied.

The work by Koop et al. [\cite=5Koop] already explored the relation between the device geometry and parameters that describe the many-body effects in a large set of QPC2F devices. This work compared nominally identical devices, and devices for which the lithographic length Llitho (see Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]a) and width of the channel in the split-gate structure was varied. These results were, however, not conclusive. The parameters that describe the many-body effects showed large, seemingly random variation, not correlated with the device geometry. At the same time, the devices showed (besides the 0.7 anomaly) clean quantized conductance traces, and the parameters that reflect the non-interacting electron physics did show the variation that one expects when changing the geometry (for example, the channel pinch-off gate voltage Vpo and subband spacing ω12). This confirms that these QPCs had saddle-point potentials that were smooth enough for showing quantized conductance, while it also shows that the many-body effects are very sensitive to small static fluctuations on these saddle-point potentials or to nanoscale device-to-device variations in the dimensions of the potentials. This picture was confirmed by shifting the channel position inside a particular QPC2F device. This can be implemented by operating a QPC2F with a difference ΔVg between the values of Vg on the two gate fingers in Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]a. Such a channel shift did not change the quantized conductance significantly, but did cause strong variation in the signatures of many-body physics. Earlier work had established that such device-to-device fluctuations can be due to remote defects or impurities, a slight variation in electron density, or due to the nanoscale variation in devices that is inherent to the nanofabrication process [\cite=5Koop] [\cite=5DefectsInteractions] [\cite=5JohnAltDavies]. Consequently, studying how the many-body effects depend on the length of the QPC channel requires QPCs for which the channel length can be tuned continuously in situ, and where this can be operated without a transverse displacement of the QPC channel in the semiconductor material. The work that we report here aimed at realizing such devices.

This article is organized as follows: Section [\ref=5sec:designConsids] starts with a short overview of the options and the choices we made for realizing the QPC6F devices. Next, in Section [\ref=5sec:Simulations], we present the results of electrostatic simulations. In Section [\ref=5sec:sampleFabAndTech], we describe the sample fabrication and measurement techniques. This is followed by comparing results from simulations and experiments for QPC6F devices in Section [\ref=5sec:ExperimentalRelization], and Section [\ref=5sec:Conclusion] summarizes our conclusions.

Design considerations

We designed our QPC6F devices with 6 rectangular gate fingers, in a symmetric layout with two sets of 3 parallel gate fingers (Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]b and Fig. [\ref=fig2DesignQPC6F]a). SEM inspection of fabricated devices yields that the central gate finger is 200 nm wide (as measured along the direction of channel length Leff). The outer gate fingers are 160 nm wide, and the narrow gaps between gate fingers are 44 nm wide. This yields (200  +  2  ·  160  +  2  ·  44) ~ nm  =  608 ~ nm for the total distance between the outer sides of the 3 parallel gate fingers. The lithographic width of the QPC channel (distance between the two sets of 3 gate fingers) is 350 nm.

An example of alternative designs for the gate geometries that we considered is in Fig. [\ref=fig2DesignQPC6F]b. This design has a two-sided funnel shape for the channel and this could result in length-tunable QPC operation that better maintains a regular shape for the saddle-point potential. However, the electrostatic simulations in Section [\ref=5sec:Simulations] show that the rectangular gate fingers as in Fig. [\ref=fig2DesignQPC6F]a also give a length-tunable saddle-point potential that maintains a regular shape while tuning the length. This observation holds for a range of device dimensions similar to our design. For our particular design, the lithographic length and width (350 nm) of the channel are comparable, and the 2DEG is as far as 110 nm distance below the surface (and the part in the center of the channel that actually contains electrons is very narrow, about 20 nm). In this regime, the saddle-point potential is strongly rounded with respect to the lithographic shapes of the gates (see for example Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]c,d). An important advantage of the rectangular design is that it provides two clear points for calibrating the effective channel length Leff: Operating at Vg2 / Vg1  =  0 gives Leff = Llitho for the central gate finger alone (200 nm, see Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]b), while operating at Vg2 / Vg1  =  1 gives Leff equal to the lithographic distance between the outer sides of the 3 parallel gate fingers (608 nm).

A point of concern for this design that deserves attention is whether the narrow gaps between the 3 parallel gate fingers induce significant structure on the saddle-point potential. The electrostatic simulations show that this is not the case (see again the examples in Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]c,d). The part of the channel that contains electrons is relatively far away from the gate electrodes, and the potential U at this location is strongly rounded. Notably, the full height of the potentials in Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential] is about 1 eV, while the occupied subbands are at a height of only about 10 meV above the stationary point of the saddle-point potential (in the center of the channel). Such gaps between parallel gate electrodes can be much narrower when depositing a wider gate on top of the central gate, with an insulating layer between them. We chose against applying this idea since we also aimed to have devices with a very low level of noise and instabilities from charge fluctuations at defect and impurity sites in the device materials. In this respect, we expect better behavior when all gate fingers are deposited in a single fabrication cycle, and when deposition of an insulating oxide or polymer layer can be omitted.

Electrostatic simulations

This section presents results of electrostatic simulations of the saddle-point potentials that define the QPC channel. The focus is on the design with 6 rectangular gate fingers (Fig. [\ref=fig2DesignQPC6F]a), with gate dimensions as mentioned in the beginning of Section [\ref=5sec:designConsids]. The simulations are based on the modeling approach that was introduced by Davies et al. [\cite=5Davies].

Davies' method for simulating 2DEG electrostatics

Davies et al. [\cite=5Davies] introduced a method for modeling the electrostatics of gated 2DEG. It calculates the electrostatic potential U for electrons in the 2DEG regions around the gates (the approach only applies to the situation where the 2DEG underneath the gates is depleted due to a negative voltage on gate electrodes). There are other models and approaches [\cite=5JohnAltDavies] [\cite=5SniderAltDavies] [\cite=5MinhanAltDavies] [\cite=5LauxAltDavies] [\cite=5John1AlteDavies] for calculating such potential landscapes, but these are all more complicated and computationally more demanding. The approach by Davies et al. is relatively simple. It does not account for electrostatic screening effects, and, notably, it does not account for the electron many-body interactions that were mentioned earlier. Still, it was shown that it is well suited for calculating a valid picture of a QPC saddle-point potential near the channel pinch-off situation [\cite=5Koop].

The negative voltage on a gate that is needed to exactly deplete 2DEG underneath a large gate is called the threshold voltage Vt, and it is to a good approximation given by

[formula]

Here n2D is the electron density in the 2DEG (at zero gate voltage), d is the depth of the 2DEG, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the material below the gate, and ε0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum (for details see Ref. [\cite=5Koop] [\cite=5Davies]). The value of Vt for a certain 2DEG material defines the value U0 where the electrostatic potential U for electrons in the 2DEG becomes higher than the chemical potential of the 2DEG. In turn, this can be used to define in an arbitrary potential landscape U (for arbitrary gates shapes and for arbitrary gate voltages) the positions where U = U0. That is, one can calculate the positions in a gated device structure where there is a boundary between depleted and non-depleted 2DEG, and also calculate the electrostatic potential U around such points. When the center of the QPC has U = U0, the channel is at pinch-off and no electrons can pass through the QPC. The gate voltage at which this happens is called the pinch-off voltage Vpo. Notably, the calculated value of U at a certain position is simply the superposition of all the contributions to U from different gate electrodes, and it is linear in the gate voltage on each of these electrodes [\cite=5Davies].

Figure [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential] presents examples of saddle-point potentials U that are calculated with Davies' method, both for QPC2F and QPC6F devices. The calculations are for material parameters and geometries of measured devices (as described in detail in the next sections). Figures [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]c,d show that the length of the transport channel depends on the applied ratio Vg2 / Vg1, and that the narrow gaps between 3 parallel electrodes in QPC6F devices do not give significant structure on the saddle-point potential in the operation regime that we consider.

Definition and tuning of the effective length Leff

The focus of this work is on realizing QPC channels with a tunable length. The channels are in fact saddle-point potentials (see Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]), and it is for such a smooth shape not obvious what the value is of the channel length. We therefore characterize this channel length with the parameter Leff, which corresponds to the value of the lithographic length Llitho of a QPC2F type device (with rectangular gate electrodes, see Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]a) that gives effectively the same saddle-point potential.

We implemented this as follows. We calculated the saddle-point potential U(x,y) for the pinch-off situation (see Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]b and Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]a for how the x- and y-directions are defined). The transverse confinement in the middle of the QPC (defined as x = 0, y = 0) is parabolic to a very good approximation. When moving out of the channel along the x-direction, the transverse confinement becomes weaker, but remains at first parabolic. Notably, the energy eigenstates for confinement in such a parabolic potential, described as

[formula]

have a width that is (for all levels) proportional to ω- 1 / 20. In this expression m* is the effective mass of the electron and ω0 is the angular frequency of natural oscillations in this potential. The parameter ω0 defines here the steepness of U(y), and we obtain ω0(x) values from fitting Eq. [\ref=5equ:parabollaUy] to potentials U(x,y) obtained with Davies's method. We use this and investigate the width Δy(x) in y-direction for the lowest energy eigenstate, at all positions x along the channel (see Fig. [\ref=5fig:Lalpha]a). For parabolic confinement this wavefunction in y-direction has a Gaussian shape and has a width

[formula]

With this approach we analyzed that the distance from x = 0 to the x-position xα where the value Δy(x) increased by a factor α  ≈  1.1 defines a suitable point for defining the value of Leff. That is, we define

[formula]

and find xα by solving

[formula]

for a certain α. Subsequently, Leff is defined by using the suitable α value,

[formula]

We came to this parameterization as follows. We used this ansatz first in simulations of QPC2F devices. Here, we explored for different values of α the relation between Llitho and Lα. Results of this for α  =  1.05, 1.1 and 1.2 are presented in Fig. [\ref=5fig:Lalpha]b. For the range of Llitho values that is of interest to our study (~  100 nm to ~  500 nm), we find the most reasonable overall agreement between the actual value for Llitho (input to the simulation) and the value Lα (derived from the simulation) for α = 1.1. The agreement is not perfect, but we analyzed that the deviation is within an uncertainty that we need to assume because the exact shapes of saddle-point potentials in different device geometries do show some variation, and because the limited validity of Davies' method. Nevertheless, it provides a reasonable recipe for assigning a value Leff to any saddle-point potential, with at most 20% error.

Fig. [\ref=5fig:Lalpha]c presents results of calculating Lα = Leff for α = 1.1 from simulations of a QPC6F device, operated at different values for Vg2 / Vg1. The results show a clear monotonic trend, with Leff = 210 ~ nm for Vg2 / Vg1 = 0 to Leff = 525 ~ nm for Vg2 / Vg1 = 1. This is for a QPC6F device for which we expect Leff = 200 ~ nm for Vg2 / Vg1 = 0 and Leff = 608 ~ nm for Vg2 / Vg1 = 1 (see Section [\ref=5sec:designConsids]). In Section [\ref=5sec:ExperimentalRelization] we discuss how this latter point is used for applying a small correction to the simulated values for Leff. These simulations show that the QPC6F that we consider allows for tuning Leff by about a factor 3.

It is worthwhile to note that our current design showed optimal behavior in the sense that it can tune Leff from about 200 nm to 600 nm, while the dependence of Leff on Vg2 / Vg1 is close to linear. We also simulated QPC6F devices with wider gate electrodes for the outer gates, and (as mentioned in Section [\ref=5sec:designConsids]) devices with gate geometries as in Fig. [\ref=fig2DesignQPC6F]b. These devices showed a steeper slope for part of the relation between Vg2 / Vg1 and Leff, which is not desirable.

Sample fabrication and measurement techniques

We fabricated QPC devices with a GaAs/Al0.35Ga0.65As MBE-grown heterostructure, which has a 2DEG at 110 nm depth below its surface from modulation doping. The layer sequence and thickness of the materials from top to bottom (i.e. going into the material) starts with a 5 nm GaAs capping layer, then a 60 nm Al0.35Ga0.65As layer with Si doping at about [formula], which is followed by an undoped spacer layer of 45 nm. The 2DEG is located in a heterojunction quantum well at the interface with the next layer, which is a 650 nm undoped GaAs layer. This heterostructure was grown on a commercial semi-insulating GaAs wafer, after first growing a sequence of 10 GaAs/AlAs layers for smoothing the surface and trapping impurities. The 2DEG had an electron density n2D = 1.6  ·  1015  ~  m -  2 and a mobility μ  =  118 ~ m2V -  1s -  1. We fabricated both conventional QPC2F devices and QPC6F devices by standard electron-beam lithography and clean-room techniques. The gate fingers were deposited using 15 nm Au on top of a 5 nm Ti sticking layer. For measuring transport through the QPCs we realized ohmic contacts to the 2DEG reservoirs by annealing of a AuGe/Ni/Au stack that was deposited on the wafer surface [\cite=5OhmicKoopIqbal]. The geometries of the fabricated devices were already described in the beginning of Section [\ref=5sec:designConsids].

The measurements were performed in a He-bath cryostat and in a dilution refrigerator, thus getting access to effective electron temperatures from 80 mK to 4.2 K. We used standard lock-in techniques with an a.c. excitation voltage Vbias = 10 ~ μV RMS at 387 Hz. Fig. [\ref=fig1SEMpic]a shows the 4-probe voltage-biased measurement scheme, where both the current and the actual voltage drop Vsd across the QPC channel are measured such that any influence of series resistances could be removed unambiguously. The gate voltages are applied with respect to a single grounded point in the loop that carries the QPC current.

Experimental realization of length-tunable QPCs

This section presents an experimental characterization of the QPC6F devices that we designed (Fig [\ref=fig1SEMpic]b) and we compare the results to our simulations. Figure [\ref=5fig:Isoconductance2D] presents measurements of the conductance G as a function of Vg1 and Vg2. Several labels in the plot illustrate relevant concepts, which were partly discussed before. For the area in this plot with Vg2 more negative than Vg1 we expect some quantum-dot like localization in the middle of the channel and this regime should therefore be avoided in studies of QPC behavior. Further, the plot illustrates that operation for a particular value of Leff requires co-sweeping of Vg1 and Vg2 from a particular point below pinch-off in a straight line to the pivot point. This corresponds to opening the QPC at a fixed ratio for Vg2 / Vg1. The pivot point is the point where the gate voltages do not alter the original electron density of the 2DEG. For this measurement this is for Vg1 = Vg2  =  0 ~ V, but this is different for the case of biased cool downs. We carried out biased cool downs for suppressing noise from charge instabilities in the donor layer [\cite=5PRBBCool] [\cite=5PRLBCool]. For such experiments the QPCs were cooled down with a positive voltage on the gates. We typically used +0.3 V, and observed indeed better stability with respect to charge noise. The effect of such a cool down can be described as a contribution to the gate voltage of -0.3 V that is frozen into the material [\cite=5PRBBCool] [\cite=5PRLBCool]. Consequently, co-sweeping of Vg1 and Vg2 for maintaining a fixed channel length must now be carried out with respect to the pivot point Vg1 = Vg2  =    +  0.3 ~ V instead of Vg1 = Vg2  =  0 ~ V.

The theory behind the Davies method illustrates why operation at fixed effective lenght requires a fixed ratio Vg2 / Vg1. All points in the potentials landscapes U for QPC2F devices as in Fig. [\ref=fig3SaddlePotential]a,b have a height that scales linear with the gate voltage Vg. Thus, when opening the QPC the full saddle-point potential changes height at a fixed shape. Mimicking this situation with QPC6F devices requires a fixed ratio Vg2 / Vg1, again because Vg1 and Vg2 influence U in a linear manner. The plot also illustrates the two special operation lines where the effective length of the channel is unambiguous, and we used these points to better calibrate the relation between Vg2 / Vg1 and Leff. The first case is the line at Vg2 = 0, which yields Leff = 200 ~ nm, as defined by the central gates alone. The second case is the line Vg1 = Vg2. Here Leff is 608 nm, as defined by the full lithographic length of the 3 gate fingers.

We improved and further checked our calibration of the relation between Vg2 / Vg1 and Leff as follows. We used the trend that came out of the simulations (Fig. [\ref=5fig:Lalpha]c), but pinned the curve at 200 nm for Vg2 / Vg1 = 0 and at 608 nm for Vg2 / Vg1 = 1 (black line in Fig. [\ref=5fig:LalphaVsmeasured]b). This trace shows good agreement with results from an independent check (dashed line) that used the pinch-off gate voltage Vpo as an identifier for the effective length. This independent check used data from a set of QPC2F devices for calibrating the relation between Llitho and Vpo (Fig. [\ref=5fig:LalphaVsmeasured]a). This shows the trend that shorter QPC2F devices require a more negative gate voltage to reach pinch-off [\cite=5VpvsL]. We related this to the pinch-off values in QPC6F devices. In particular, we analyzed the pinch-off points on the Vg1 axis, and its dependence on Vg2 / Vg1 (see also Fig. [\ref=5fig:LinearG]). The results of using this for assigning a certain Leff to each Vg2 / Vg1 is the dashed line in Fig. [\ref=5fig:LalphaVsmeasured]b, and shows good agreement with the values that were obtained from simulations. We can thus assign a value to Leff for each Vg2 / Vg1 with an absolute error that is at most 50 nm. Notably, the relative error when describing the increase in Leff upon increasing Vg2 / Vg1 is much smaller.

The results in Fig. [\ref=5fig:LinearG] provide an example of linear conductance measurements on a QPC6F device at 80 mK. The traces show clear quantized conductance plateaus for all settings of Leff. Several of these linear conductance traces also show the 0.7 anomaly, and the strength of its (here rather weak) expression shows a modulation as a function of Leff over about 3 periods. A detailed study of this type of periodicity can be found in Ref. [\cite=5IqbalPerio]. This example illustrates the validity and importance of our type of QPCs in studies of length-dependent transport properties.

Conclusions

We have developed and characterized length-tunable QPCs that are based on a symmetric split-gate geometry with 6 gate fingers. Gate structures with different shapes and dimensions can be designed depending upon the required range for length tuning and for optimizing the tuning curve. For our purpose (QPCs with an effective channel length between about 200 nm and 600 nm, and 350 nm channel width) we found that simple rectangular gate fingers are an attractive choice. Our simulations and experimental results are in close agreement. We were able to tune the effective length by about a factor 3, from 200 nm to 608 nm. QPCs are the simplest devices that show clear signatures of many-body physics, as for example the 0.7 anomaly and the Zero-Bias Anomaly (ZBA) [\cite=Cronenwett2002]. Our length-tunable QPCs provide an interesting platform for systematically investigating these many-body effects. In particular, these QPCs provide a method for studying the influence of the QPC geometry without suffering from device-to-device fluctuations that hamper such studies in conventional QPCs with 2 gate fingers. Studies in this direction are presented in Ref. [\cite=5IqbalPerio].
