On the spherical derivative of a rational function

A rational function is a holomorphic map from the Riemann sphere into itself. We equip the Riemann sphere with the usual spherical metric whose length and area elements are

[formula]

So the norm of the derivative with respect to the spherical metric is

[formula]

In this paper we study the quantity [formula]. d'Ambra and Gromov [\cite=d'ambra] proposed to study the rate of growth of [formula] as n  →    ∞   for the iterates fn of smooth maps of Riemannian manifolds, especially those maps in a given class for which this growth rate is the smallest possible. Such maps are called "slow". Slow maps of an interval and slow Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a 2-torus have been investigated in [\cite=borichev2] [\cite=PS] and [\cite=borichev1].

Let f be a rational function of degree d. As the map [formula] is d-to 1, we conclude that

[formula]

This implies that

[formula]

We ask how small can K(f) be for a function of given degree.

1. It is known that K(f)  ≥  2 for all rational functions of degree at least 2. In fact this holds for all smooth maps of the sphere into itself which satisfy [formula] [\cite=Gromov]. It is not known whether K(f) = 2 can hold for rational functions of degrees 3 or 4.

2. An interesting question is whether ([\ref=1]) is best possible in certain sense. We have

Theorem 1. There exists an absolute constant C with the following property. For every d  ≥  2 there exists a rational function of degree exactly d such that

[formula]

An analogous result was obtained by Gromov [\cite=Gromov] for smooth maps of spheres of arbitrary dimension.

Littlewood [\cite=L] and Hayman [\cite=Hayman] studied the quantity

[formula]

where the sup is taken over all rational functions of degree d. For polynomials φ(d) was also studied in [\cite=ES] [\cite=E] [\cite=LW]. It is easy to see that [formula] and Hayman obtained [formula] using a rational approximation of elliptic functions. Our Theorem 1 implies this with a more elementary proof. Indeed, by a change of the independent variable,

[formula]

Denote

[formula]

Let f be the function from Theorem 1. By rotating the sphere of the independent variable we may achieve that

[formula]

because the spherical area of the image sphere is π and it is covered d times. Let M =  max |z|  ≤  1f#. Theorem 1 implies that [formula], so

[formula]

Proof of Theorem 1. For every positive integer n, consider the function

[formula]

We first show that

[formula]

where C is independent of n. We have

[formula]

Now fix [formula] and let m be an integer such that [formula]. For |w - z|  ≤  1 / 2 put

[formula]

Then evidently

[formula]

We write fn = gh, [formula], and estimate h using ([\ref=raz1]):

[formula]

Now h is holomorphic in |w - z|  ≤  1 / 2, so by Cauchy's theorem,

[formula]

Next we estimate h(z) from below using ([\ref=raz1]) again:

[formula]

Combining all these estimates we obtain

[formula]

This proves ([\ref=f])

When [formula], we will obtain better estimates. Using

[formula]

we obtain for z > 2n and [formula]:

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

if |x|  ≥  n + 2. Combining this with ([\ref=f]) we obtain

[formula]

for all z. As fn has period π, there exists a rational function Rn such that fn(nz) = Rn(e2z). This rational function has degree 2n2 and the derivative satisfies [formula] This completes the proof of Theorem 1.

Theorem 2. There exists an absolute constant c > 1 with the property that

[formula]

for all rational functions of degree d  ≥  2.

This can be considered as an analog of a result of Tsukamoto [\cite=Tsukamoto]. He studied spherical derivatives ([\ref=spherd]) of meromorphic functions [formula], where Δ is the unit disc with the Euclidean metric and proved that there exists an absolute constant c1 < 1 with the property that ω(F(Δ))  ≤  c1π for all meromorphic functions F satisfying F#  ≤  1, where

[formula]

We derive Theorem 2 from this result. In fact we show that Theorem 2 holds with [formula].

Proof of Theorem 2. Proving by contradiction, we suppose that there exists a sequence fm of rational functions of degrees m, such that

[formula]

Let ω be the spherical area measure, so that

[formula]

and ωm = f*mω the pull back of ω by fm. Then

[formula]

It is easy to see that we can find discs [formula] (with respect to the spherical metric) of radii rm such that

[formula]

To show this, choose rm so that the first equation is satisfied and then integrate

[formula]

with respect to a. Evidently [formula].

Let [formula] be the point diametrically opposite to am, and let [formula] be the conformal map (inverse to a stereographic projection) such that φm(0) = a,φm(Δ) = Dm, then

[formula]

uniformly with respect to z. Then [formula] is a normal family. Let F =  lim Fm. From ([\ref=10]), ([\ref=11]) follows that then F#  ≤  1, but the area of F(Δ)  ≥  π / b2 in view of ([\ref=13]), contradicting the result of Tsukamoto.

Theorems 1 and 2 have analogs for maps [formula] which are stated and proved in the same way as for n = 1, using he Fubini-Study metric for the norm of the derivative. Constants C and c will of course depend on n.

Now we consider dynamical questions. By fn we denote the n-th iterate, and our standing assumption is that d(f)  ≥  2. We define

[formula]

The limit always exists because the sequence an  =   log K(fn) is subadditive, am + n  ≤  am + an and for every such positive sequence the limit lim n  →    ∞an / n exists and is equal to inf nan / n (see, for example, Lemma 1.16 in [\cite=Bowen]).

It follows that k∞(fm) = mk∞(f).

Notice that k∞ is independent of the choice of a smooth Riemannian metric on the sphere, and is invariant under conjugation by conformal automorphisms. Obviously, k∞(f)  ≤   log K(f).

3. What is the smallest value of k∞(f) for rational functions of given degree?

The trivial lower estimate of K(f) gives

[formula]

We will see that equality never happens, and that the Lattés functions are not extremal for minimizing k∞. For functions fd of degree d from Theorem 1 we have

[formula]

so the (1 / 2) in ([\ref=4]) cannot be replaced with a larger constant.

In [\cite=EL] these quantities were studied for polynomials, in particular, the inequality k∞(f)  ≥   log d(f) was established for polynomials, with equality only if f is conjugate to zd.

Let us consider a slightly different quantity, the maximum characteristic exponent

[formula]

The difference in the definitions of k∞ and χm is in the order of max z and lim n  →    ∞. Przytycki proved in 1998 (reproduced in [\cite=Pr]) that the same quantity χm(f) can be obtained by taking the sup over periodic pints z of f, in which case the lim sup  in ([\ref=chim]) can be of course replaced by the ordinary limit. Moreover, he proved the following:

Theorem P. For every ε > 0 there exists a periodic point z such that

[formula]

where m is a period of z.

In particular, k∞  =  χm, and one can replace [formula] in ([\ref=chim]) by sup  over all periodic points.

4. Let χa(f) be the average value of

[formula]

over the measure μ of maximal entropy. According to the multiplicative ergodic theorem, we have

[formula]

almost everywhere with respect to μ.

Theorem 4. χa(f)  ≥  (1 / 2) log d, this is best possible and equality holds only for Lattés examples.

Proof. The estimate follows from the formula

[formula]

where h(f) =  log d is the topological entropy, and dim μ is the Hausdorff dimension of the maximal measure, see, for example [\cite=ELy] and references therein. Obviously dim μ  ≤  2 so we obtain our inequality. On the other hand, a theorem of A. Zdunik [\cite=Zdunik] says that dim μ = 2 can happen only for Lattés examples. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Now we consider the Lattés functions [\cite=Milnor].

Proposition 1. If L is a Lattés function then χm(L)  ≥   log d(L).

Proof. A Lattés function can be defined by a functional equation

[formula]

where F is an elliptic function with a critical point at 0. Assuming without loss of generality that F(0) = 0 we conclude that 0 is a fixed point of L. Now the derivative at this fixed point is

[formula]

from which follows that χm(L)  ≥  d(L).

To summarize, we have 4 quantities satisfying inequalities

[formula]

For Latteés functions we have

[formula]

In the first inequality equality holds only for Lattés functions. For functions fd constructed in Theorem 1, we have log K(fd)  ≤  (1 / 2) log d + O(1).

Which of the rest of these inequalities ([\ref=5]) are strict and what are the conditions of equality? According to a private communication of Przytycki, the method of Zdunik can be used to show that χa(f) = χm(f) is only possible when f is conjugate to z±  d in which case both quantities are equal to log d.

Proposition. Let [formula]. Then k∞  =   log K(f) if and only if M contains a cycle.

Proof. If z is a point whose trajectory is in M, then [formula] so k∞(f) =  log K(f).

Suppose now that k∞  =   log K(f). We claim that

[formula]

Indeed, otherwise for some m we have

[formula]

and if this holds, then

[formula]

contrary to our assumption. This proves the claim.

The set M∞ is forward invariant. All sets

[formula]

are real algebraic subsets of [formula], and thus the set M∞ is also real algebraic. If M∞ is finite it must contain a cycle.

Suppose that M is infinite. Let M1,...Mq be the list of connected components of M. Then there must be a cycle of components. Let [formula] be this cycle, so that f(Mj)  ⊂  Mj + 1, f(Mk) = M1. If any of these components contains singular points, then all singular points in these components form a finite invariant set, and this set must contain a cycle. If all Mj, 1  ≤  j  ≤  k are smooth, then fk:M1  →  M1 is an expanding map of a circle, so it must have a fixed point. Again we obtain a cycle in M. This completes the proof.
