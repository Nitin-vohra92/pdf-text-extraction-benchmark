Pressure effects on the superconducting thin film Ba1 - xKxFe2As2

Since the report of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO1 - xFx [\cite=hosono08], Fe-based superconductors have attracted strong interest because of their high superconducting transition temperature (high-Tc) and the size of the materials space where superconductivity is discovered [\cite=stewart11]. Similarity to the cuprate superconductors has been pointed out in that superconductivity is introduced when carriers are induced by hole/electron doping the antiferromagnetic parent compounds and FeAs or FeSe layers are deeply involved in the superconductivity as the CuO layers are in the high-Tc cuprates. It has been recently suggested that the anion height measured from the Fe plane is an important parameter that controls the Fermi surface topology and consequentially the superconductivity [\cite=clee08] [\cite=kuroki11]. There exists an optimal height (hm) where the superconducting transition temperature is a maximum and Tc decreases as the height departs from hm.

Thin films grown on different types of single crystal substrates may manifest uniaxial pressure effects because a lattice mismatch relative to the substrate leads to either contraction or expansion of the film and a change in the anion height [\cite=hiramatsu12]. Iida et al. reported that Tc of a Ba(Fe,Co)2As2 (Co-Ba122) thin film changes from 16.2 to 24.5 K with increasing c / a, where the out-of-plane lattice parameter c decreases with an increase of the in-plane lattice constant a for different types of substrates [\cite=Iida09]. Bellingeri et al. found that the Tc of 21 K for a FeSe0.5Te0.5 thin film is significantly higher than 16.2 K for a bulk crystal, suggesting that strain effects in thin films may provide a way to raise Tc [\cite=bellingeri10].

Despite the ever growing interest in thin film studies, however, the high volatility of the doping elements often makes it difficult to fabricate thin films of the iron-pnictide superconductors. An electron-doped BaFe2 - xCoxAs2 thin film with Tc  ≈  20 K has been synthesized with relative ease because cobalt atoms have a lower vapor pressure, while a hole-doped Ba1 - xKxFe2As2 thin film has been fabricated only recently by overcoming the technical difficulty of a large difference in the vapor pressures of constituent elements [\cite=slee09] [\cite=slee10] [\cite=Iida10] [\cite=katase10] [\cite=takeda10] [\cite=nlee10]. Lee et al. recently reported successful synthesis of a thin film of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, where Tc is as high as 40 K [\cite=nlee10]. Here we report for the first time the dependence of superconducting properties on externally applied pressure for a Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 thin film. Unlike single crystalline compounds, Tc of the optimally doped thin film does not decrease monotonically with pressure but rather shows a dome centered around 11.8 kbar (=Pc). The electrical resistivity of the film in the normal state shows an anomalous power-law temperature dependence under pressure. The local temperature exponent of the resistivity shows a funnel shape above the optimal pressure Pc, suggesting that fluctuations relevant to anomalous normal state properties are responsible for high-Tc superconductivity in the Fe-pnictides superconductors.

Optimally doped thin films of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 were grown on LaAlO3 (001) substrates by a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, and X-ray diffraction measurements showed that films with a tetragonal structure grow preferentially along the crystalline c-axis [\cite=nlee10]. The lattice parameters determined from a least-squares refinement of the x-ray pattern are a = 3.9068 Å and c = 13.4037 Å, where c / a = 3.4308 is slightly larger than that of optimally doped bulk crystals (=3.40) [\cite=rotter08]. Electrical resistivity of the K-doped BaFe2As2 thin film was measured by a standard four-probe technique in a closed cycle refrigerator (CCR). A clamp-type Be/Cu hybrid cell with a NiCrAl alloy insert was used for resistivity measurements up to 28.2 kbar, and a change in the resistivity of an annealed manganin wire was used as a pressure monitor at room temperature [\cite=dmowski99].

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity ρ of a thin film of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 under pressure. As shown in the inset, the onset temperature of a superconducting (SC) phase transition (Tonsetc), which is defined as the deviation point from a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in the normal state (dotted line), is 39.95 K at ambient pressure, the highest for optimally doped films on a LaAlO3 (LAO) substrate. The SC transition width, the difference between a 10 % to 90 % drop of the normal state resistivity at Tonsetc, is 1.30 K and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) [formula] at 1 bar is 38, indicating the high quality of this thin film. Here, [formula]cm is an extrapolated value from the [formula] dependence in the normal state. Externally applied pressure monotonically reduces the resistivity in the normal state because of an increased overlap among adjacent ligand orbitals under pressure: ρ at 41 K and 300 K decreases at a rate of -0.6 and -1.1 ×  10- 3 ~ mΩcm/kbar, respectively.

The pressure evolution of superconducting transition temperatures is plotted in Fig. 2, where Tonsetc, Tmidc, and Tzeroc represents the onset, midpoint and zero-resistance transition temperatures, respectively (see the inset of Fig. 1). Tonsetc gradually increases from 39.95 K at 1 bar to 40.8 K at 11.80 kbar and then decreases with further increasing pressure, showing a dome-shaped superconducting phase centered on the optimal pressure Pc(=11.80 kbar). Such pressure effects on the thin film are unexpected because Tc of single crystals with similar stoichiometry is continuously suppressed with pressure [\cite=yamazaki10] [\cite=torikachvili08]. For Ba1 - xKxFe2As2 bulk crystals, the c / a ratio almost linearly increases with potassium concentration x and is approximately 3.410 for an optimally K-doped compound (x = 0.4) [\cite=rotter08]. The ratio c / a = 3.4308 observed in our thin film corresponds to an overdoped concentration x = 0.46 for a bulk crystal, ruling out the possibility that the thin film on LAO is underdoped. In addition, the Tc of 39.95 K is too high for any underdoped compound. For comparison, Tc of an optimally doped bulk crystal is 38 K [\cite=rotter08] [\cite=luo08].

The unusual pressure dependence of the optimally doped thin film may be ascribed to a high c / a ratio that arises from a lattice mismatch between the film and LAO substrate. It has been reported that the c / a ratio of a Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 thin film deposited on Al2O3 (AO)and LaAlO3 (LAO) substrates is 3.4028 and 3.4308, respectively [\cite=nlee10]. The superconducting transition temperature of a film on a AO substrate is almost 1 K higher than that on a LAO substrate, indicating that the anion height of a AO-film is close to the optimal height hm, while the anion height of a film on LAO is slightly larger than hm. Lattice constants of the LAO substrate are almost independent of hydrostatic pressure and isotropic among crystalline axes: the relative change in lattice constants being only 0.55% at 32.1 kbar [\cite=zhao04]. In contrast, the lattice constants of a tetragonal BaFe2As2 single crystal are compressed significantly both along the crystalline a- and c-axes with pressure: at 32.1 kbar, the lattice constant a and c decreases by 1.03 and 2.02%, respectively [\cite=kimber09]. When the thin film of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 is under hydrostatic pressure, it effectively experiences a uniaxial pressure along the c-axis because the change in the lattice constant a is almost negligible because it is pinned to the substrate lattice, while the lattice constant along the c-axis is compressed as easily as in a single crystal. Consequently, hydrostatic pressure acts as an effective uniaxial pressure along the c-axis and controls the anion height of the film to the optimal hm at 11.8 kbar, therefore making the dome-shaped SC phase under pressure.

Figure 3(a) displays the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 thin film on the LAO substrate for several pressures. Regardless of the applied pressure, a power-law form of ρ  =  ρ0 + ATn best describes the normal state resistivity over an extended temperature range above Tc, where the exponent n of the resistivity changes between 1.1 and 1.25 under pressure (see Fig. 3(b)). The anomalous temperature exponent n is consistent with previous work on single crystals that reported a gradual change of n from 2 (undoped) to 1 (at optimal potassium doping) [\cite=shen11].

Figure 4 plots the local temperature exponent of the resistivity ([formula]) in T - P phase space, where Δρ  =  ρ(T) - ρ(T = 0K). The local exponent n is less than 1.25 below 100 K in the measured pressure range, which is comparable to the results via a global fit of the resistivity (see Fig. 3(a)). The local analysis, however, reveals a delicate topology in the resistivity exponent, showing a funnel shape with n = 1.1 above the optimal pressure. Even though the optimally doped Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 thin film at 1 bar is probably in the vicinity of a quantum critical point (QCP), external pressure sensitively tunes the film right to the QCP where the associated quantum fluctuations diverge. A similar analysis based on the local resistivity exponent has been performed to show evidence for quantum critical behavior in other iron-pnictides superconductors as a function of chemical doping [\cite=kasahara10], which inherently incur disorder whose effects on the electron scattering may change with doping concentration. In this work, the K-doped Ba122 thin film with x = 0.4 was sensitively tuned to a critical point via pressure, thus allowing us to study the quantum critical behavior without incurring additional disorder. A funnel shaped resistivity exponent above an optimal pressure has been also reported in the pressure-induced heavy fermion superconductor CeRhIn5 [\cite=park08]. Future characterization of the spectra of quantum fluctuations that are pertinent to the high SC transition temperature in iron-pnictides superconductors requires simultaneous tuning of such external parameters as pressure, magnetic field, and low temperatures.

We fabricated Ba1 - xKxFe2As2 (x = 0.4) thin films on a LaAlO3 substrate, where Tc is 39.95 K. The sharp superconducting phase transition (ΔTc = 1.30 K) and large residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 38) indicate high quality of the film. Unlike single crystals with similar stoichiometry, Tc of the thin film with optimal potassium concentration gradually increases to 40.8 K at 11.8 kbar (Pc) and decreases with further increasing pressure, showing a dome shape. The unusual pressure dependence of Tc is ascribed to a lattice mismatch between the LAO substrate and thin film, where applied hydrostatic pressure effectively acts as uniaxial pressure along the crystalline c-axis of the film. The local temperature exponent of the resistivity reveals a funnel-shaped topology surrounding the optimal pressure Pc, indicating the presence of a quantum critical point where the normal-state properties are dominated by the associated quantum fluctuations.
