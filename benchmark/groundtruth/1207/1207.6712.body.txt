Introduction

This paper is a complement to the author earlier paper [\cite=F]. We consider a billiard table rectangle with perimeter of length 1. If a billiard ball is sent out from position F(1) at the angle of π / 4, then the ball will rebound against the sides of the rectangle consecutively in points F(2), F(3), . Let [formula] and Φ  =  {F(j):1  ≤  j  ≤  n} be the set of different points. An open connected subset of the perimeter of the billiard rectangle with different endpoints from the set Φ is called segment. A segment with endpoints F(k), F(l), 1  ≤  k,l  ≤  n, is called even (or odd), and has weight |k - l| (or k + l) if k, l are of the same (or different) parity. Length of a segment is a distance along the perimeter between its endpoints. A segment with the length less than [formula] is called short. A segment is called elementary if there are no points of the set Φ between its endpoints. Suppose [formula]. A segment I is associated with V if I is an elementary segment incident with an element of V or [formula] is nonempty set contained in V. Since [formula], any segment associated with {F(1),F(n)} is determined by its endpoints uniquely. By (F(k),F(l)) (respectively (F(k),F(l))e) we denote the short segment (respectively the elementary segment) incident with F(k) and F(l). Note that (F(k),F(l)) and (F(l),F(k)) are the same segments.

Let ω1  <  ω2 be odd weights and ω0 be an even weight of segments associated with {F(1)}, and let ω3  <  ω4 be other odd weights of segments associated with {F(1),F(n)} (see Corollary [\ref=corr2.1]). Let ai be the length of the segment with the weight ωi, and suppose that Ai is the set of all elementary segments with weight ωi, [formula]. The author [\cite=F] have proved that the weights of elementary segments have at most five different values [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

If a2  -  εa1  =  a3  -  δa4 = a0, for some ε, δ∈{ - 1,1}, then the following equations are satisfied

[formula]

Moreover, elementary segments with equal weights have equal lengths. In this paper we prove the following equalities (see Theorem [\ref=theo2.2]):

[formula]

Notice that we can consider a general case, when the initial angle of the ball's motion is not π / 4. By a linear transformation we can change the billiard table rectangle, so that the general case is transformed to the π / 4 case (except the result that elementary segments with equal weights have equal lengths).

The main result

Recall the following results of the paper [\cite=F].

[\cite=F] An odd elementary segment which is not short is of the form (F(1),F(2))e or (F(n - 1),F(n))e.

[\cite=F] If (F(k),F(1))e, (F(1),F(n))e, 1 < k < n, are elementary segments incident with F(1), then k is even.

[\cite=F] If (F(1),F(n))e, (F(n),F(l))e, 1 < l < n are elementary segments incident with F(n), then l,n are of different parity.

[\cite=F] Let k + 1 < l and k, l be of different parity. Then we have: a short segment (F(k),F(l)) is elementary, or is associated with {F(1),F(n)} if and only if the short segment (F(k + 1),F(l - 1)) is elementary.

[\cite=F] There exist exactly two odd segments and one even segment associated with {F(1)}, and exactly four odd segments associated with {F(1),F(n)}. The weights of these four odd segments are different.

Now we present the main result of this paper.

Let ω1  <  ω2 be odd weights and ω0 be an even weight of segments associated with {F(1)}, and let ω3  <  ω4 be other odd weights of segments associated with {F(1),F(n)}. If A1 (A4) is the set of all elementary segments with weight ω1 (ω4, respectively), then

[formula]

Proof. Suppose (F(k),F(1))e, (F(1),F(l))e, k < l, are elementary segments incident with F(1), and (F(r),F(n))e, (F(n),F(t))e, r < t, are elementary segments incident with F(n). By Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.1 k is even and t, n are of different parity. Hence, segments (F(k),F(1))e, (F(n),F(t))e are odd. If (F(k),F(1))e (or (F(n),F(t))e) is short, then by Lemma 2.1,
