Forward dihadron correlations in the Gaussian approximation of JIMWLK

Introduction

At high energy or, equivalently, small x, the interactions of hadrons are expected to be dominated by nonlinear strong color fields. A convenient effective theory approach to studying these color fields is provided by the Color Glass Condensate (for a review see e.g. [\cite=Lappi:2010ek]).

Measurements of correlations between two forward hadrons in dAu collisions at RHIC [\cite=Braidot:2011zj] [\cite=Adare:2011sc] seem to show indications of "initial state" or "cold nuclear matter" effects that are significantly stronger than in pp collisions or at central rapidities. The upcoming LHC proton-lead collisions will provide more opportunities to study these phenomena in a wider kinematical range.

These observations have provided an impetus for renewed interest in the gluonic correlations included in the JIMWLK evolution, see e.g. [\cite=Dumitru:2011vk]. In particular it was argued that the result of a full JIMWLK evolution, at finite [formula], can quite accurately be captured by the so called Gaussian approximation, relating higher point Wilson line correlators to the two-point function. These recent theoretical developments were not fully reflected in the pioneering calculations of dihadron correlations in [\cite=Marquet:2007vb] [\cite=Albacete:2010pg] where a factorized approximation is derived in a certain kinematical limit. The main purpose of this work (see Ref.  [\cite=Lappi:2012nh]) is to implement the Gaussian approximation, which so far has only been tested for particular coordinate space configurations, in a full calculation of the dihadron correlation.

Single inclusive baseline

We shall here use the dipole operator obtained from solving numerically the BK evolution equation using the Balitsky running coupling prescription [\cite=Balitsky:2006wa]. The BK equation requires an initial condition, for which we take the McLerran-Venugopalan model [\cite=McLerran:1994ni]

[formula]

with Q2s = 0.2   2 for the proton at x0 = 0.007 similarly as in Ref.  [\cite=Albacete:2010bs] . Following Ref.  [\cite=Dumitru:2005gt] we can then calculate single inclusive hadron production in forward rapidities. The comparison with STAR π0 and BRAHMS charged hadron data is shown in Fig.  [\ref=fig:pp-yield]. This parametrization overestimates the pion yield by a factor ~  3, but describes the charged hadron yield correctly. We prefer to use the same parameters as Ref.  [\cite=Albacete:2010bs] to see clearly the effects of including the Gaussian quadrupole. We expect most of the overall normalization error to cancel in the per trigger correlation and not affect the systematics of the away side peak.

For a nuclear target we use larger initial saturation scale, and we set [formula] to 0.72 2 at same x0 = 0.007 which fits the most central PHENIX [formula] data shown in Fig.  [\ref=fig:rdau]. However it seems quite impossible to simultaneously describe STAR minimum bias data. We consider the normalization issue of the single inclusive baseline as the largest uncertainty in our calculation.

Dihadron correlations

Consider a large x quark with momentum p+ from the probe deuteron or proton, propagating eikonally through the target nucleus or proton. It can radiate a gluon with momentum k+ = zp+ and is left with longitudinal momentum q+  =  (1 - z)p+. In the high energy limit the scattering of both the quark and the gluon can be described by the eikonal approximation, where they pick up a phase given by a Wilson line in the color field of the target. The detailed derivation of the double inclusive cross section is performed in Ref. [\cite=Marquet:2007vb] and results in the following expression for the qA  →  qgX cross section:

[formula]

with [formula] and likewise, [formula]. The momenta of the produced gluon and quark are [formula] and [formula] respectively. Likewise, [formula] should be interpreted as the transverse position of the gluon and [formula] of the quark, in the amplitude and the complex conjugate respectively. Here S(n) are operators constructed from Wilson lines whose expressions can be found e.g. from Ref.  [\cite=Marquet:2007vb], and φ is the q  →  qg splitting function. We set the scale at which the parton distribution functions, fragmentation functions and coupling constant are evaluated, to be equal to the transverse momenta of the trigger hadron.

In Fig.  [\ref=fig:finite-vs-large] we show the parton level dihadron production cross section obtained using different approximations for the quadrupole when evaluating S(4). We notice that the width and especially the height of the away side peak are modified when replacing the naive approximation, used e.g. in [\cite=Albacete:2010pg], by the Gaussian approximation [\cite=Dominguez:2011wm]. The comparison with experimental data is shown in Fig.  [\ref=fig:cp], where we compute the coincidence probability measured by the PHENIX collaboration [\cite=Adare:2011sc]. Once we have adjusted the Δφ independent pedestal contribution we obtain a good description of the Δφ dependent part of the data.

Double parton scattering

The Δφ independent pedestal in the experimentally measured coincidence probability is mostly due to the double parton scattering contribution where two hadrons are produced independently of each other. In previous works [\cite=Albacete:2010pg] [\cite=Stasto:2011ru] this process has been considered to be completely separated from the correlated dihadron production. However, when one uses the Gaussian approximation for the quadrupole function one can show that Eq.  [\eqref=eq:dihadron-xs] actually contains part of this DPS (Double Parton Scattering) contribution.

The DPS contribution is obtained when gluon is emitted far away from the quark: [formula] [formula]. In this limit the only surviving correlation in S(4) is the product of an adjoint representation dipole at the location of the gluon and a fundamental representation one at the location of the quark. We call this kinematical regime the "DPS" limit. In this limit the Wilson lines of the quark and the gluon are uncorrelated and we have, using the fact that the expectation values must be color singlets,

[formula]

where [formula] is a correlator of two Wilson lines (two point function) in the fundamental representation, and the expectation value of [formula] can be identified as the two point function in the adjoint representation.

For massless quarks the four-point function S(4) causes the integral ([\ref=eq:dihadron-xs]) to diverge logarithmically in the DPS limit. Physically this means that the quark emits a very small transverse momentum gluon. The quark and gluon subsequently scatter independently off the target. The DPS limit corresponds to a splitting happening a long time before the interaction with the target. This logarithmically divergent contribution must be regulated by confinement scale physics in the wavefunction of the projectile. It is in fact exactly the kind of contribution that is represented by double parton scattering, discussed in this context e.g. in Ref. [\cite=Strikman:2010bg].

We add to the dihadron production cross section the DPS contribution. In order to avoid double counting the logarithmically divergent DPS part is subtracted from Eq.  [\eqref=eq:dihadron-xs]. This forces us to introduce an arbitrary (soft) cutoff scale [formula]. The DPS contribution is then divided into two separate parts. The first one corresponds to taking two partons from the same nucleon in the deuteron, described by a single-nucleon double parton distribution function, which we model by implementing a kinematical constraint xi  +  xj  <  1 following Ref.  [\cite=Strikman:2010bg]. The second contribution involves taking one parton from the neutron and the other one from the proton, which is not bound by the same kinematical constraint. Once we have obtained the corresponding parton distribution functions, the DPS yield is essentially the single inclusive yield squared.

As a result we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate for the Δφ independent pedestal. When comparing with PHENIX data, we obtain for the trigger transverse momentum range [formula] a pedestal 0.11 - 1, whereas the experimental value is 0.176 - 1. Similarly for the trigger transverse momentum [formula] we obtain 0.08 - 1, and the experimental value reads 0.163 - 1 [\cite=Adare:2011sc].

Conclusions

We have shown that the previously used "naive large-[formula]" approximation for the quadrupole is not accurate, and the width and especially the height of the back-to-back peak is modified when more accurate Gaussian approximation is used. In addition, the naive approximation misses an important logarithmically divergent DPS contribution, which is included consistently in our work.

We obtain a relatively good estimate for the Δφ independent pedestal background, and a good description of the Δφ dependent part of the PHENIX data. We also point out that the "naive large-[formula]" approximation clearly underestimates the height of the away side peak.
