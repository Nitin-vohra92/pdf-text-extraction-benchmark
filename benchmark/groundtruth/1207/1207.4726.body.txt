Introduction

A natural question in finite geometry is the following.

Let G1 and G2 be two geometries embedded in a projective space. Is every isomorphism between G1 and G2 induced by a collineation of the ambient projective space?

Of course, the answer to this question will strongly depend on the properties of the geometries G1 and G2. In this paper, we study this problem for particular geometries, namely linear representations.

Let K be a point set in [formula] and embed H∞ in [formula]. The linear representation T*n(K) of K is a point-line incidence structure with natural incidence, point set P and line set L as follows:

affine points of [formula] (i.e. the points of [formula]),

lines of [formula] through a point of K, but not lying in H∞.

We see that a linear representation T*n(K) in [formula] is entirely defined by the point set K at infinity.

If the answer to (Q) is affirmative, then it follows that two linear representations T*n(K) and T*n(K') are isomorphic if and only if the point sets K and K' are [formula]-equivalent, which we denote by [formula]. In Section [\ref=sec3], we provide certain (weak) conditions on the point sets K and K' such that the answer to question (Q) is affirmative for T*n(K) and T*n(K'). This leads to the following theorem (Corollary [\ref=hoofd]).

For such K, the automorphism group of T*n(K) is studied in Section [\ref=sec5], where an explicit description is given. In Section [\ref=sec4], we investigate what happens when the conditions on K, found in Section [\ref=sec3], are not fulfilled.

Linear representations are mostly studied for point sets K that possess a lot of symmetry. For example, in the case n = 2 and K a hyperoval, T*2(K) is a generalised quadrangle of order (q - 1,q + 1). Bichara, Mazzocca and Somma showed in [\cite=bichara] that for K,K' hyperovals, [formula] if and only if [formula]. The answer to (Q) is proven positive when K is a regular hyperoval in [formula] in [\cite=Grund]. When K is a Buekenhout-Metz unital, question (Q) is answered by De Winter in [\cite=stefaan]; in this case, the linear representation T*2(K) is a semipartial geometry. It is worth noticing that our result includes these cases.

A further generalisation of the concept of semipartial geometries is that of (α,β)-geometries. Also these geometries can be constructed using linear representations. For more information, we refer to [\cite=declerck].

We will also deal with a slight variation of the question (Q), namely, we will consider isomorphisms between the incidence graphs of linear representations.

We denote the point-line incidence graph of T*n(K) by Γn,q(K), i.e. the bipartite graph with classes P and L and adjacency corresponding to the natural incidence of the geometry.

Whenever we consider the incidence graph Γn,q(K) of some linear representation T*n(K) of K, we still regard the set of vertices as a set of points and lines in [formula]. In this way we can use the inherited properties of this space and borrow expressions such as the span of points, a subspace, incidence, and others.

It is easy to see that dealing with question (Q) for Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') is essentially the same as dealing with the question for T*n(K) and T*n(K') when there is no isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') mapping a vertex of Γn,q(K) corresponding to a point onto a vertex of Γn,q(K') corresponding to a line. In Section [\ref=sec2], we give a condition on K,K' to ensure that every isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') preserves the set P.

One of the reasons to generalise the answer to (Q) for incidence graphs of linear representations is the paper [\cite=wij], where we use them to construct new mutually non-isomorphic infinite families of semisymmetric graphs, i.e. regular edge-transitive, but not vertex-transitive graphs.

Also from a computational point of view, this generalisation is worthwhile: it follows from our main theorem that, under certain conditions, [formula] if and only if [formula]. By computer, checking whether two graphs are isomorphic often can be done a lot faster than checking whether two point sets in a projective space are [formula]-equivalent.

A property of Γn,q(K)

Note that an automorphism of T*n(K) as an incidence structure maps always points onto points and lines onto lines, whereas an automorphism of Γn,q(K) might map vertices corresponding to points onto vertices corresponding to lines. Of course, in this latter case, the sets P and L have equal size, hence |K| = q.

Consider two linear representations T*n(K) and T*n(K'). We may assume that both geometries are embedded in the same (n + 1)-dimensional projective space, and that K and K' are embedded in the same hyperplane H∞. This implies that, for both bipartite graphs Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') we can denote the set of vertices of the first type (the points) by P. We denote the set of vertices of the second type (the lines) in Γn,q(K) by L and in Γn,q(K') by L'. For a vertex v in a graph Γ and a positive integer i we write Γi(v) for the set of vertices at distance i from v.

The following lemma provides a condition which forces the neighbourhood of a vertex in the set P and of a vertex in the set L to be essentially different.

Let K be a set of points of H∞ such that every point of [formula] lies on at least one tangent line to K, then [formula].

We will prove that, for every line L∈L, the set of vertices Γn,q(K)4(L) contains at least one vertex that has all its neighbours in Γn,q(K)3(L), while for every point P∈P, a vertex in the set Γn,q(K)4(P) cannot have all its neighbours in Γn,q(K)3(P).

To prove the first claim, consider a line L∈L with [formula]. Choose an affine point Q on L and a point P2∈K different from P1. Take a point R on QP2, not equal to Q or P2, then clearly the line RP1∈Γn,q(K)4(L). We will show that RP1 has all its neighbours in Γn,q(K)3(L). Consider a neighbour S of RP1, i.e [formula]. The line SP2 meets L in a point T. Since T∈Γn,q(K)1(L) and TP2∈Γn,q(K)2(L), it follows that S∈Γn,q(K)3(L).

Consider now a point P∈P and a point T∈Γn,q(K)4(P). Consider the following minimal path of length 4 from T to P: the point T, a line Q1P1∈Γn,q(K)3(P) containing T for some P1∈K and affine point Q1∈Γn,q(K)2(P), the line PP2∈Γn,q(K)1(P) containing Q1, for some P2∈K different from P1, and finally the point P. Consider the point [formula], then it follows from our construction that R lies on the line P1P2. Moreover R is different from P1,P2, and hence, since PR∉Γn,q(K)1(P), we have R not in K. By assumption, there is a tangent line of K through R, say RP3, with P3∈K. The line TP3 is a neighbour of T. Suppose that TP3 belongs to Γn,q(K)3(P), then there exists a line PT' through a point P4∈K, with T' on TP3, which implies that RP3 contains the point P4∈K, a contradiction.

Let |K|  ≠  q or let K be a set of points of H∞ such that every point of [formula] lies on at least one tangent line to K. Suppose α is an isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K'), for some set K' in H∞, then α stabilises P.

Since any graph isomorphism preserves distance and hence neighbourhoods, no isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') maps a vertex in P to a vertex in L'.

If K does not satisfy the conditions of Corollary [\ref=cor22], then there exist counterexamples to the corollary. Let K be the q-arc [formula], q even, embedded in the plane H∞ of [formula] with equation X0 = 0. Consider the mapping φ from the affine point (1,a,b,c) to the line 〈(0,1,a,a2),(1,0,c,b2)〉, this map preserves the edges of the graph Γ2,q(K) but switches the sets P and L.

The isomorphism problem for linear representations

In this section, we will deal with question (Q) for (the incidence graphs of) linear representations. An isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') (or T*n(K) and T*n(K')) that is induced by a collineation of the ambient projective space [formula] is called geometric.

As said before, we will provide certain conditions on K, to ensure that every isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') (or T*n(K) and T*n(K')) is geometric. One of these conditions is related to the closure of K, which we will now define.

If a point set S contains a frame of [formula], then its closure [formula] consists of the points of the smallest n-dimensional subgeometry of [formula] containing all points of S.

The closure [formula] of a point set S can be constructed recursively as follows:

determine the set A of all subspaces of [formula] spanned by an arbitrary number of points of S;

determine the set [formula] of points that occur as the exact intersection of two subspaces in A, if [formula] replace S by [formula] and go to (i), otherwise stop.

For n = 2, this recursive construction coincides with the definition of the closure of a set of points in a plane containing a quadrangle, given in [\cite=Hughes].

We will also introduce the notion of rigid subspaces:

Let α be an isomorphism between the graphs Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') (or between T*n(K) and T*n(K')) that preserves the set P. We will say that a k-subspace π∞ of H∞ is α-rigid if for every (k + 1)-subspace π through π∞, not contained in H∞, the point set {α(P)|P∈π,P∉H∞} spans a (k + 1)-subspace.

We see that the definition of rigid is well-defined for the graph Γn,q(K), since, as said before, we consider this graph to be embedded in [formula].

From now on, we fix an isomorphism α between the graphs Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') that preserves P, and if a subspace is called rigid, we mean α-rigid. It follows from the definition of the graph Γn,q(K) that every point of [formula] is rigid.

It is clear that if an isomorphism β between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') (or T*n(K) and T*n(K')) is induced by a collineation, necessarily, every point of H∞ is β-rigid. Our way of approaching question (Q) is to find conditions on the point sets K, K' that force every point of H∞ to be rigid (for all isomorphisms between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K')). Finally, these conditions will enable us to prove that every isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') (or T*n(K) and T*n(K')) is induced by a collineation.

We start of with an easy lemma on rigid subspaces.

If π1 and π2 are rigid subspaces meeting in at least one point, then [formula] is a rigid subspace.

Let R be an affine point, let dim (πi) = ki and [formula]. Since πi is rigid, the affine points of 〈R,πi〉 are mapped onto the affine points of a (ki + 1)-dimensional space μi. As μ1 and μ2 are subspaces of [formula], they intersect in a subspace of [formula]. Moreover, as this subspace contains exactly the images under α of the points that are contained in [formula], it has dimension m + 1. This implies that [formula] is rigid.

In the previous lemma, we proved that the intersection of rigid subspaces is a rigid space. The next step towards the proof of our main theorem is to show that the span of rigid subspaces is again a rigid subspace. Unfortunately, we need to impose certain restrictions to be able to show this result.

Recall that the points of K are rigid. In the next lemma, we will give a condition that ensures that the span of two points of K is a rigid line. This result will be generalised in Lemma [\ref=opspanning] to arbitrary rigid points and spaces of arbitrary dimension.

For a line L of [formula] not in H∞, we define ∞  (L) to be the point [formula].

Let q > 2. Suppose that no plane of H∞ intersects K or K' in two intersecting lines or in two intersecting lines minus their intersection point. Let P1 and P2 be two points of K, then P1P2 is rigid.

Both α as α- 1 define an isomorphism. From our proof it will follow that if K has the property that no plane of H∞ intersects it in two intersecting lines or in two intersecting lines minus their intersection point, the set K' has this property as well, and conversely. Hence it does not matter whether K or K' has the property; we assume that no plane of H∞ intersects K' in two intersecting lines or in two intersecting lines minus their intersection point.

First, suppose the line N of H∞ containing the points P1,P2 of K, contains an extra point P3∈K. Let π be a plane through P1P2, not in H∞, let Li, [formula], be the q lines in π through P1, different from P1P2, and let Mj, [formula], be the q lines through P2 in π, different from P1P2. It is clear that the distance between L1 and Li, [formula] in Γn,q(K) is 4.

Suppose that ∞  (α(L1)) is different from ∞  (α(Li)) for some 2  ≤  i  ≤  q. If for some j  ≠  k, α(Mj) and α(Mk) meet H∞ in the same point, then α(L1) and α(Li) are lines in the same plane, hence, meeting in an affine point. This would mean that α(L1) and α(Li) are at distance 2 in Γn,q(K'); a contradiction since α is an isomorphism.

This implies that if ∞  (α(L1)) is different from ∞  (α(Li)) for some i, then the points ∞  (α(Mj)), 1  ≤  j  ≤  q, are distinct and hence all the points ∞  (α(Li)), 1  ≤  i  ≤  q, are also mutually different. Moreover, it is impossible that ∞  (α(Li)) =   ∞  (α(Mj)) for some 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  q, since Li and Mj are at distance 2 in Γn,q(K) and α is an isomorphism. Using that α(Li) meets α(Mj) in a point for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  q, we see that the sets [formula] and [formula] are each contained in a regulus of a hyperbolic quadric Q+(3,q). However, a line through P3 is mapped to a line that contains q points of this quadric, but is not contained in a regulus of this quadric, a contradiction, hence P1P2 is rigid.

Now suppose that the line N does not contain an extra point of K, then we now know that either P1P2 is rigid, or the lines [formula] and [formula] are each contained in a regulus of a hyperbolic quadric Q+(3,q). This quadric meets H∞ in a plane π containing two lines N1,N2 (the remaining lines in each of these reguli) and the 2q points of N1 and N2, different from their intersection point, are necessarily points of K'.

By our assumption, this is either not possible or there exists a point P∈K' on π, not on the lines N1 and N2. Consider a line T through P intersecting N1 in a point S1 and intersecting the line N2 in a point S2, for which S1  ≠  S2. Consider the plane η through T, different from π, intersecting the quadric Q+(3,q) in two lines, one line through S1 and the other through S2. By the first part, T is rigid for any isomorphism from T*n(K') to T*n(K), hence the plane η is mapped by α- 1 to the plane π, so the lines through S1, S2 respectively, are mapped to the lines through P1, P2 respectively. This is a contradiction since the lines of the reguli of the quadric are already mapped by α- 1 to the lines through P1 and P2 in π. It follows that P1P2 is rigid.

For q = 2, an element of L contains only two points of P. If K = H∞, clearly a permutation of P will always induce an automorphism of T*n(K). Moreover, consider the linear representation T*2(K) where q = 2; we checked by computer that whatever point set K you take in [formula], the full automorphism group of T*2(K) will always be larger than the automorphism group induced by collineations of [formula].

From now on, in the remaining of this section, we assume that for all point sets K of H∞ there is no plane of H∞ intersecting K only in two intersecting lines, or in two intersecting lines minus their intersection point. Sometimes we will explicitly refer to this as the set K having Property (*). We also assume that the point set K spans H∞.

We can define a mapping α̃ on the set of rigid points by putting α̃(Q) =   ∞  (α(L)) where Q is a rigid point and L is any line for which ∞  (L) = Q.

We have to show that this mapping is well-defined, hence, if Q is a rigid point and L1 and L2 are two lines through Q, not contained in H∞, then we will show that ∞  (α(L1)) =   ∞  (α(L2)).

We first show that the mapping is well-defined for points of K. Consider a line L1 through P1 contained in a k-space through a (k - 1)-space [formula], for points Pi∈K. Consider the case k = 2, then by Lemma [\ref=help], we know that P1P2 is rigid. Let π be the plane 〈L1,P2〉, this plane intersects H∞ in the line P1P2. The lines of π through P1 partition the affine points of π, and α is an isomorphism mapping lines of π through P1 onto lines, hence ∞  (α(L)) =   ∞  (α(L1)) is the same point for all lines L in π through the point P1, different from P1P2.

Now we proceed by induction. Suppose that for every line L∈L through P1, contained in a k-space through a (k - 1)-space [formula], Pi∈K, k  ≤  n, we have ∞  (α(L)) =   ∞  (α(L1)). Consider a point Pk + 1∈K not in [formula], and let M∈L be any line through P1, contained in a (k + 1)-space through the k-space [formula]. The plane 〈M,Pk + 1〉 meets the (k - 1)-space [formula] in a line N for which ∞  (N) = P1. By the induction hypothesis, ∞  (α(N))  =    ∞  (α(L1)). Moreover, from the case k = 2, we know that for the line M, it holds that ∞  (α(M)) =   ∞  (α(N)). Hence, using that the points of K span H∞, we have shown that the theorem is valid for all points of K.

Now suppose that Q is a rigid point not contained in K. Let L be a line through Q. Consider a point Pi∈K and the plane π  =  〈L,Pi〉; let M be a line through Q in π different from L. Let Nj, j = 1,2, be two lines in π, going through the point Pi. We have shown in the previous part that ∞  (α(N1)) =   ∞  (α(N2)). It follows that α(L) and α(M) lie in a plane, hence, they meet in a point. Since α is an automorphism and L and M only meet in a point at infinity, α(L) and α(M) cannot meet in an affine point, hence ∞  (α(L)) =   ∞  (α(M)). The lemma now follows by induction with the same argument as used above for points of K.

The previous lemma shows that, an isomorphism α between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') preserving points can be extended to the rigid points Q∈H∞ by putting α(Q): = α̃(Q).

If [formula] are rigid points, then [formula] is a rigid space.

We proceed by induction on the dimension k of the rigid space. Let k = 1, and let π be a plane meeting H∞ in the line P1P2, and let R be an affine point of π. By Lemma [\ref=crucial], since P1 and P2 are rigid, the points on the line RPi, i = 1,2, are mapped by α to the points on the line 〈α(R),α(Pi)〉. Let S  ≠  R be a point of π, not on P1P2, RP1 or RP2 and let T1 (resp. T2) be the intersection point of the line SP1 (resp. SP2) with RP2 (resp. RP1), then α(T1) lies on 〈α(R),α(P2)〉 and α(T2) lies on 〈α(R),α(P1)〉. It follows from Lemma [\ref=crucial] that α(S) lies on 〈α(T1),α(P1)〉 and 〈α(T2),α(P2)〉, hence, α(S) is contained in the plane 〈α(R),α(P1),α(P2)〉. It follows that P1P2 is rigid.

Now suppose that [formula], with all Pi rigid, is a rigid space of dimension k  ≤  n - 1. Let Pt be a rigid point, different from [formula]. If Pt∈π, the space π  =  〈π,Pt〉 is rigid. Suppose Pt∉π, then μ: = 〈π,Pt〉 is a space of dimension k + 1. Let R be an affine point of [formula], then, since π is rigid and by Lemma [\ref=crucial], we have that every affine point of 〈R,π〉 is mapped by α to an affine point of [formula]. Let S be a point of 〈R,μ〉, not in 〈R,π〉. If S lies on RPt, then α(S) is certainly contained in [formula], hence, we may suppose that S does not lie on RPt. The line SPt meets 〈R,π〉 in a point T. As α(T) lies in [formula] and α(S) lies on the line through α(Pt) and α(T) by Lemma [\ref=crucial], α(S) lies in [formula]. This proves our lemma.

Let q > 2. Let K and K' denote point sets having Property (*) in [formula] such that the closure [formula] is equal to H∞, and such that, if |K| = q every point of H∞ lies on at least one tangent line to K. Let α be an isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K'). Then α is induced by an element of stabiliser [formula] mapping K onto K'.

By Corollary [\ref=cor22], every isomorphism between Γn,q(K) and Γn,q(K') maps points onto points. Hence, the concept 'rigid' is well-defined. It follows from the construction of the closure of a set and from Lemmas [\ref=intersectie] and [\ref=opspanning], that all points in [formula] are rigid. Hence α maps collinear points of a line, not in H∞, onto collinear points.

As announced before, we abuse notation and use α for the extension of α to all points of [formula]. Let P,Q,R be three points on a line L contained in H∞ and let S be a point, not contained in H∞. Since L is a rigid line, α maps the points of 〈S,L〉 onto points of a plane containing α(P),α(Q), and α(R) at infinity. This implies that α also maps collinear points of H∞ to collinear points of H∞, hence, is a collineation that stabilises H ∞ .

If [formula] is H∞, clearly K spans H∞ and hence, [formula]. Taking this into account, the previous theorem has the following corollary.

Let q > 2. Let K denote a point set having Property (*) in [formula] such that the closure [formula] is equal to H∞, and such that if |K| = q, every point of H∞ lies on at least one tangent line to K. Then [formula].

Since an isomorphism between incidence structures T*n(K) and T*n(K') by definition maps points to points, the assumption that every point of H∞ lies on a tangent line to K and K' (showing that points and lines cannot be mapped onto each other) can be dropped, and we have the following corollary.

Let q > 2. Let K and K' denote point sets having Property (*) in [formula] such that the closure [formula] is equal to H∞ and let α be an isomorphism between T*n(K) and T*n(K'). Then α is induced by an element of [formula] mapping K to K'.

In the next section, we will give some examples of non-geometric automorphisms of T*n(K) for point sets K not satisfying the conditions of Corollary [\ref=hoofd].

Non-geometric automorphisms

In Corollary [\ref=hoofd], it is assumed that K satisfies Property (*) and that the closure of K is H∞. It turns out that, if one of these conditions is not satisfied, there exist counterexamples to this corollary. We give explicit constructions of such counterexamples and provide computer results that give more information on [formula] for small n and q. All the mentioned computer results were obtained with GAP [\cite=GAP].

Point sets not satisfying Property (*)

Recall that Property (*) states that K is a point set such that there is no plane of H∞ intersecting K only in two intersecting lines, or in two intersecting lines minus their intersection point. Let K be the point set of two intersecting lines in [formula], we will show that there exist non-geometric automorphisms of T*2(K), and construct the automorphism group [formula].

From the findings in the proof of Lemma [\ref=help] and the following lemmas in Section [\ref=sec3] we deduce that an automorphism φ of T*2(K) in this case is either geometric, and thus induced by an element of [formula], or is some non-geometric mapping of T*2(K). The lines of L in planes intersecting K in exactly two points are either mapped to lines in planes or to lines of hyperbolic quadrics Q+(3,q). It is easy to see that, if the lines of L in some plane that intersects K in exactly two points are mapped to the lines of a hyperbolic quadric Q+(3,q), then this is true for all planes that intersect K in exactly two points, just by looking at the intersection of two planes and the intersection of a plane and a hyperbolic quadric. We will construct such a mapping and show that if ψ and ψ' are non-geometric, then ψ'  =  χ1ψχ2 with [formula].

Without loss of generality, let H∞ be the plane of [formula] with equation X0 = 0, and let the set K consist of the points of two intersecting lines L1:X0 = X1 = 0 and L2:X0 = X2 = 0.

For the set of affine points P of T*2(K), the mapping

[formula]

induces a non-geometric automorphism of T*2(K).

The map φ is clearly a bijection.

We will describe the action of φ on all lines not in H∞. Lines through (0,0,0,1) not in H∞ are stabilised by φ. A line M of T*2(K) through (0,1,0,u), [formula], such that 〈M,L2〉 is the plane with equation yX0 - X2 = 0, with [formula], is mapped by φ to a line of T*2(K) through (0,1,0,u + y). A line N of T*2(K) through (0,0,1,u'), [formula], such that 〈N,L1〉 is the plane with equation xX0 - X1 = 0, with [formula], is mapped by φ to a line of T*2(K) through (0,0,1,u' + x). The affine points of a line through (0,1,v,w), [formula], v  ≠  0, not in H∞, are mapped by φ to the affine points of an irreducible conic containing the point (0,0,0,1). More specifically, the affine points of the line 〈(1,x,y,z),(0,1,v,w)〉, v  ≠  0, are mapped to the points of the conic with equation (z - wx)X20 + vX21 + (w + y - vx)X0X1 - X0X3 = 0, different from (0,0,0,1). This conic is contained in the plane X2  =  (y - vx)X0 + vX1. The mapping φ induces an automorphism of T*2(K), but is clearly not induced by a collineation.

If a group G has a normal subgroup N and the quotient G / N is isomorphic to some group H, we say that G is an extension of N by H. This is written as G  =  N.H.

An extension G  =  N.H which is a semidirect product is also called a split extension and is denoted by [formula]. This means that one can find a subgroup [formula] in G such that [formula] and [formula].

Consider the group S of non-geometric automorphisms of T*2(K) induced by [formula]. It is clear that S is isomorphic to [formula].

The group [formula] is the full automorphism group of T*2(K) and is q times larger than the geometric automorphism group [formula].

Consider a non-geometric automorphism ψ of T*2(K). We look at its action on the planes through the line N with equation X0 = X3 = 0. One can check that the pencil of planes [formula] is mapped by ψ to the pencil of hyperbolic quadrics [formula] for some non-zero [formula]. By multiplying with a well-chosen element of [formula], we may say that the pencil of planes [formula] is mapped by ψ to the pencil of hyperbolic quadrics [formula]. Also, by using a well-chosen collineation of [formula] which switches the lines L1 and L2 if necessary, the pencils of planes [formula] and [formula] are both fixed by ψ.

The mapping φ maps every plane aX0 + X3 = 0 to the hyperbolic quadric X0(aX0 + X3) + X1X2 = 0 and fixes all the planes of the form bX0 + X1 = 0 and cX0 + X1 = 0. We now consider the mapping φ- 1ψ, this map sends planes through N to planes through a line of H∞, hence, as seen before, sends all planes to planes. Thus, φ- 1ψ is induced by some collineation of [formula]. We see that ψ  =  χ1φχ2 with [formula] and hence [formula] is the full automorphism group of T*2(K).

Since the group S has order q and is a normal subgroup of [formula] such that [formula] is trivial, the theorem follows.

For q = 3,4, we take K to be the point set of two intersecting planes in [formula]. We see that the group [formula] is q2 times larger than [formula]. Hence, also in this case there exist automorphisms of T*3(K) which are not induced by a collineation of the ambient projective space.

There are point sets K that do not satisfy Property (*) but do have the property that [formula] consists entirely of geometric automorphisms. E.g. let K be the point set of three lines L1,L2,L3 in [formula] such that [formula] and L3 intersects L1 and L2, then, by going through the details of the proofs in the previous section, it is not too hard to check that [formula].

Point sets K with closure different from H∞

The span of K is a proper subspace of H∞

In this case, it is fairly easy to construct non-geometric automorphisms, as seen in the following theorem.

Let K be a set of points in [formula], q  ≥  4, such that dim 〈K〉  ≤  n - 1, then there exist non-geometric automorphisms of T*n(K).

Let π be the subspace of dimension d, spanned by K in H∞ and let μ1 and μ2 be (d + 1)-dimensional spaces in [formula], meeting H∞ exactly in π. Let Q be a point of H∞, not contained in π. Let φ be the mapping from points P in P to P defined as follows. When P∈μ1, then [formula], when P∈μ2, then [formula], in all other cases φ(P) = P. It is clear that φ is a bijection and that a line through a point R of π is mapped onto a line through R, thus φ is an automorphism of T*n(K). Let M be a line through a point S  ≠  Q of [formula], then we see that q - 2 points of M are fixed, but the intersection points of M with μ1 and μ2 are mapped onto points that are not on M. Hence, φ is not induced by a collineation of [formula].

The span of K is H∞ but the closure of K is not

We will construct a non-geometric automorphism of T*2(K), where K is a Baer subplane of [formula]. It is worth noticing that in this case, T*2(K) is a semipartial geometry, and that the general belief was that for every T*m(K) that is a semipartial geometry, every automorphism is geometric (see e.g. [\cite=stefaan2]).

In this construction, we use the representation of [formula] in [formula] of Barlotti-Cofman [\cite=Barlotti]. The points of the hyperplane H∞ in [formula] are represented as lines of a Desarguesian spread D in [formula]. The affine points of [formula] with respect to H∞ can be identified with the affine points of a projective space [formula], with respect to the hyperplane J∞. The lines of [formula] not in H∞ correspond to the planes of [formula], meeting J∞ in a line of D.

We start with a lemma.

For q > 2, let D be a Desarguesian spread in [formula] representing [formula] and let B be the set of lines of D corresponding to a Baer subplane of [formula]. Then there exist an element ψ of [formula] and a line L of D such that ψ stabilises B setwise and such that ψ(L) is a line meeting L in a point.

Let R be a regulus contained in B and let D' be the Desarguesian spread consisting of elements of D in the 3-space Π spanned by the elements of R. The stabiliser of R acts transitively on the lines of Π that do not intersect a line of R: the orbits of the stabiliser of R on lines of Π not intersecting R are in one-to-one correspondence with isotopy classes of semifields of order q2 with center containing q (see [\cite=cardinali]). By a classical result of Dickson, every such semifield is a field [\cite=Dickson]. This implies that there is only one such isotopy class, so for q > 2, if L is a line of D', not in R, then there exists an element φ of [formula] stabilizing R and mapping L to a line L' intersecting L in a point. If q = 2, there are only two lines disjoint from R and they both belong to D', so such line L' does not exist. Every collineation of [formula] induces a collineation of [formula] stabilising the spread D', hence, as there exists a collineation of [formula] stabilising the subline corresponding to R and fixing one point of this subline, this implies that there is a collineation φ of Π stabilising R, fixing one element R1 of R elementwise and mapping an element M of D' onto a line meeting M in a point.

Let L1 and L2 be two skew lines in B, such that 〈L1,L2〉 meets Π exactly in the line R1. The set [formula] extends to a unique Desarguesian spread of [formula], which is necessarily equal to D.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that R1 is the line through the points (1,0,0,0,0,0) and (0,1,0,0,0,0), while L1 is the line 〈(0,0,0,0,1,0),(0,0,0,0,0,1)〉 and L2 is the line 〈(1,0,0,0,1,0),(0,1,0,0,0,1)〉. If the collineation φ is given by the matrix A = (aij), 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  3, then let C = (cij), 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  5, be the matrix with cij = aij for 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  3, c44 = a00, c45 = a01, c54 = a10, c55 = a11 and 0 elsewhere. Now C, together with [formula] corresponding to φ, defines an element ψ of [formula], which stabilises R and fixes R1,L1 and L2; these elements of D define a unique Baer subplane of [formula].

Let L3 be a line of B, not contained in Π or 〈L1,L2〉, then [formula] for some R2,R3 in R. It follows that [formula] =[formula] for some R4,R5 in R, which is clearly contained in the set B. A line L4, contained in 〈L1,L2〉 can now, in the same way, be written as the intersection of 3-spaces spanned by elements of B, which are in the previous part showed to be mapped by ψ onto elements of B. Hence, also the line L4 is mapped onto a line of B by ψ and the statement follows.

In the following theorem, we will show that the collineation constructed in the previous lemma corresponds to a permutation of the affine points of [formula] that is not a collineation.

For q > 2, let K be a Baer subplane in [formula], then there exist non-geometric automorphisms of the semipartial geometry T*2(K).

Let ψ be the collineation of [formula] stabilising the line set B of [formula] setwise and such that [formula] for some L∈D, as found in Lemma [\ref=hulp]. The element ψ extends to a collineation φ of [formula] preserving affine points (with respect to J∞). Let χ be the permutation of affine points of [formula], corresponding to φ and let P,Q,R be three collinear affine points, lying on a line M of [formula], such that M meets H∞ in a point of K. The points P,Q,R correspond to 3 affine points of [formula], contained in a plane μ through a line of B. Now φ maps μ onto a plane through an element of B, which corresponds to a line N of [formula] through a point of K. It follows that χ(P),χ(Q),χ(R) belong to N, and hence, that χ defines an automorphism of T*2(K).

Let S be the point of H∞ corresponding to L and let M' be a line in [formula] meeting H∞ in S. The affine points of M' correspond to the affine points of a plane μ' through L. These are mapped by φ onto the affine points of a plane ν, where ν meets q + 1 different lines of the spread D. Hence, the affine points of M' are mapped by χ onto the points of a Baer subplane. This shows that χ is not induced by a collineation of [formula].

It follows from the proof of the previous theorem that [formula], where K is a Baer subplane in [formula] and B denotes the set of lines corresponding to K of the Desarguesian spread D, corresponding to [formula]. It is not hard to calculate that [formula] is q(q - 1) / 2 times larger than the group of geometric automorphisms [formula]. It would be interesting to know whether [formula] is the full automorphism group of [formula] when K is a Baer subplane. Unfortunately, with the methods developed in Section [\ref=sec3] we cannot prove this result. For q = 2,3,4, we were able to confirm this result by computer (by comparing orders).

Finally, if we consider the point set [formula] embedded in [formula], then the group [formula] turns out to be eight times larger than [formula]. If [formula] in [formula], then we see that the group [formula] is three times larger than the group of geometric automorphisms.

The description of the automorphism group

Since an element of [formula] induces a geometric automorphism, it defines an element of [formula] (or [formula]). In the previous section, we have shown that, under certain conditions, [formula] is the full automorphism group of Γn,q(K) (or T*n(K)). It is our goal to provide a more explicit description of [formula] in this section.

If the set of elements of [formula] fixing all points of the hyperplane H∞ is written as [formula], then [formula] consists of all elations and homologies with axis H∞.

The group [formula] is an extension of [formula] by [formula] and [formula] is an extension of [formula] by [formula].

The kernel of the action of [formula], [formula] respectively, on H∞ is clearly [formula]. The image of the action is isomorphic to [formula], [formula] respectively, showing that [formula], [formula] respectively, is an extension of [formula] by [formula], [formula] respectively.

In general, [formula] is an extension of [formula] by [formula]. However, this extension does not necessarily split since [formula] is not necessarily embeddable in [formula]. For example, [formula] has no subgroup isomorphic to [formula]. Depending on the choice of K, we can investigate whether [formula] does split over [formula]. To show that this extension splits, we need to embed the group [formula] in [formula], and different groups [formula] may require a different proof. In the next theorem, we give a general condition on K that is sufficient to show that the extension splits. The condition is not necessary: in [\cite=wij], the theorem is shown to hold when K is a basis or frame in H∞, and in [\cite=stefaan], it is shown that the same holds for Buekenhout-Metz unitals. However, our theorem proves the theorem for a lot of different point sets K at the same time.

We start with an easy lemma.

If there is an element of [formula] mapping K to a point set K' that is stabilised under the Frobenius automorphism, then [formula].

Since all automorphisms of [formula] are generated by the Frobenius automorphism, every automorphism of [formula] stabilises K'. From this, if there is an element of [formula] mapping K to K', we can also find an element of [formula] mapping K to K'. Since K' is contained in the orbit of K under [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] stabilises K', we can restrict the well-known isomorphism [formula] to elements of [formula], and the lemma follows.

If the setwise stabiliser [formula], respectively [formula], of a point set K spanning [formula], q = ph, fixes a point of H∞, then [formula], respectively [formula].

Since K spans H∞, [formula] is contained in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=ext], we see that [formula] is an extension of [formula] by [formula]. This extension splits if and only if [formula] can be embedded in [formula] in such a way that it intersects trivially with [formula]. By assumption, [formula] fixes a point P∈H∞. Suppose that P has coordinates [formula], where the first non-zero coordinate equals one. This implies that for each [formula], there exists a unique (n + 1)  ×  (n + 1) matrix B = (bij), 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n + 1, and an element [formula] corresponding to β, such that [formula]. Moreover, the obtained semi-linear maps (B,θ) form a subgroup G of [formula]. Let Aβ = (aij), 0  ≤  i,j  ≤  n + 1, be the (n + 2)  ×  (n + 2) matrix with a00 = 1, ai0 = a0j = 0 for i,j  ≥  1 and aij = bij for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n + 1. It is clear that (Aβ,θ) defines an element of [formula], corresponding to a collineation α acting in the same way as β on H∞. If [formula], then α is not a perspectivity. If [formula], then α fixes every point on the line through P and [formula], thus fixes at least two affine points, and hence is not a perspectivity. This implies that we have found a subgroup of [formula] isomorphic to [formula] and intersecting [formula] trivially.

The second claim can be proved in the same way.

If the setwise stabiliser [formula] of a point set K spanning [formula] fixes a point of H∞, and [formula], for q0 = ph0, h0|h or [formula], then [formula].

It is clear that [formula] can be embedded in [formula] by mapping [formula] to the semi-linear map [formula] where I is the (n + 2)  ×  (n + 2) identity matrix. Since [formula] intersects [formula] trivially, the corollary follows.

Examples of point sets satisfying the conditions of Theorem [\ref=isom] are ubiquitous; the case that K is a q-arc in H∞ is studied in detail in [\cite=wij].
