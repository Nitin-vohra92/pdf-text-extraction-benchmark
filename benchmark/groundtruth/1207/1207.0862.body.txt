Time Evolution within a Comoving Window: Scaling of signal fronts and magnetization plateaus after a local quench in quantum spin chains

Propagation of signals in one-dimensional (1D) strongly interacting systems has been of longstanding general interest in both condensed matter and quantum-computational physics. The phenomenon provides a basis for coherent information transfer via quantum wires. A signal can be created, e.g., as a local excitation from a stationary state, or as a domain wall or a topological excitation [\cite=Cheneau12] [\cite=d_wall]. In recent years, the nonequilibrium time evolution of such signals after global [\cite=Calabrese11] [\cite=Rossini09] [\cite=Rossini11] [\cite=Schuricht12] [\cite=Foini11] [\cite=Barmettler09] [\cite=Barmettler10] [\cite=Lancaster10] [\cite=Foster11] and local [\cite=Calabrese07] [\cite=Divakaran11] [\cite=Ganahl12] [\cite=Pereira08] [\cite=Langer11] [\cite=Langer09] [\cite=Hunyadi04] [\cite=Antal99] [\cite=Antal08] quantum quenches has been the subject of intense theoretical interest. Often hard to pursue by analytical methods, many studies have become feasible in 1D by numerical methods [\cite=tdmrg] [\cite=tebd] based on Matrix Product State (MPS) [\cite=MPS] [\cite=RO], and also by tensor network approaches [\cite=tns].

If the initial state is prepared within a finite system, boundary effects such as Friedel oscillations interfere with a passing signal. System boundaries also limit the time span for tracing the signal, before it is reflected at the boundaries in a non-trivial manner. The maximum time is even more severely restricted by entanglement which develops across the system and which requires a computational effort that can drastically increase with time [\cite=blowS]. This has greatly hampered the analysis of large time asymptotic behavior [\cite=Barmettler09] [\cite=Barmettler10] [\cite=Jesenko11] [\cite=Gobert05]. Boundary effects do not appear in infinite systems, for which the ground state and its time evolution can be calculated with MPS methods [\cite=iTEBD] [\cite=idmrg1] [\cite=idmrg2] [\cite=ipeps]. However, these methods require complete translational invariance and can therefore not be applied to study signal propagation.

In this letter we present a method to simulate the propagation of local signals on an infinite chain using MPS time evolution, without any finite size effects distorting the signal front. We study the time evolution of the Transverse Field Ising (TFI) model [\cite=Calabrese11] [\cite=Calabrese07] [\cite=Dutta10] [\cite=IgloiRieger00] [\cite=Rieger11] [\cite=Divakaran11] [\cite=Platini05] [\cite=Platini07] [\cite=Karevski02] [\cite=Rossini09] [\cite=Rossini11] [\cite=Schuricht12] [\cite=Foini11] and of the XXZ spin [formula] chain [\cite=Barmettler09] [\cite=Barmettler10] [\cite=Ganahl12] [\cite=Langer09] [\cite=Langer11] [\cite=Lancaster10] [\cite=Foster11] [\cite=Pereira08] [\cite=Gobert05] after a local quantum quench up to large times. We find distinct magnetization plateaus [\cite=Hunyadi04] [\cite=Gobert05], reminiscent of the plateaus observed in equilibrium frustrated spin chains as a function of magnetic field [\cite=Hardy04] [\cite=Heidr07] [\cite=Michaud10] [\cite=Strecka03] [\cite=Okunishi03] [\cite=Schmidt06] [\cite=Gazza06] [\cite=Vekua06]. In our case the plateaus develop over time in the longitudinal magnetization close to the signal front. Their heights and positions scale algebraically with time in the TFI model to high precision.

For our method we consider a general spin chain of infinite size, with finite range interactions, initially prepared in a state, such as the ground state, which is translationally invariant for sites x > x0 to the right of some site x0. At time zero, the system is excited by a quantum quench like one or more spin flips at sites x  ≤  x0 or a modification of the Hamiltonian at x  ≤  x0. For finite range interactions it is known from the Lieb-Robinson bound [\cite=lieb-rob] that wave fronts generated by such quenches can only propagate with a characteristic maximum velocity [formula], i.e. within a "light cone" even in a non-relativistic system, as recently also seen experimentally [\cite=Cheneau12]. Any correlations beyond the light cone are exponentially suppressed at increasing distance with a length scale of at most the correlation length [\cite=lieb-rob].

We divide the system into three parts, namely the comoving window (CMW) which moves towards the right with the wave front, and two half-infinite regions, a uniform one in front (i.e. to the right) of the window, and an arbitrary one to the rear. The window is chosen wide enough to contain the complete signal front, including the exponentially damped part to the right of the main front, to high precision. The signal will therefore not affect the system to the right of the window. Likewise, when the window moves with vmax, modifications in the rear part will not affect the CMW and need not be calculated. Since bipartite entanglement [\cite=Amico08] [\cite=Eisler08] [\cite=Eisler09] spreads at most with vmax, the bipartite entanglement entropy is significantly lower around the wave front than in the bulk, allowing for low computational effort when using the CMW.

We label the sites according to the division we have introduced: left side [formula], CMW [formula], and right side j  ≥  r + 1. We consider a Hamiltonian with nearest neighbor couplings [formula], which subdivides correspondingly into

[formula]

The wave function in the sz basis becomes

[formula]

where sj labels the spin at site j. It can be approximated very closely in the form of an infinite matrix product [\cite=MPS]

[formula]

where [formula] are left-orthogonal matrices in the left part, [formula] and [formula] are left- and right-orthogonal matrices inside the CMW, respectively, Rsr + 1  ≤  j are right-orthogonal matrices in the right part and [formula] are diagonal matrices containing the Schmidt values of a bipartition at bond (k,k + 1). For a finite system, the left and right ends of [\eqref=eq:CMW_MPS] are terminated by contractions with boundary vectors; we however consider the infinite size limit. In standard TEBD notation [\cite=tebd], Lsj  =  λj - 1Γsj,Asj  =  λj - 1Γsj,Bsj  =  Γsjλj, and Rsj  =  Γsjλj. The matrices Rsj are obtained as the stationary state of iTEBD[\cite=iTEBD], thus there are only two independent matrices, and Rsj + 2  =  Rsj.

Let us consider one step of the time evolution. Using Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [\cite=TrotterSuzuki], we apply adaptive time evolution with respect to [formula] inside and to the right of the CMW, and, e.g., non-adaptive time evolution with respect to [formula] to the left of the CMW.

Adaptive time evolution inside the CMW can be performed either by tDMRG [\cite=tdmrg] or TEBD [\cite=tebd], using local operators [formula] with finite time steps τ. To the right side of the CMW, the evolution of [formula] is performed by iTEBD  [\cite=iTEBD] [\cite=HastingsiTEBD].

Special attention has to be paid to the operation of û~r,r + 1(τ) at the junction between the CMW and the right side. We explain our procedure in terms of tDMRG representations. After a sweeping process [\cite=tdmrg] to the right boundary of the CMW (j  =  r), and the first iTEBD half-step (on Γsr + 1λr + 1Γsr + 2), we face the following matrix product

[formula]

We then operate with û~r,r + 1(τ) on ψsrsr + 1~ = Asrλr~Rsr + 1~ and apply singular value decomposition (SVD including truncation) on the result, which yields

[formula]

with ωr containing the updated Schmidt values.

After the second iTEBD half-step (on Γsr + 2λr + 2Γsr + 1), the matrix Vsr + 1~ will differ from the new matrix Rsr + 1~ by some unitary MPS gauge transformation x, such that Vsr + 1~  =  x  Rsr + 1, since there is negligible influence of the signal around the right boundary by construction (see also results below). Using right orthogonality [\cite=MPS] [formula], x is obtained as [formula]. We arrive at

[formula]

where the right side is again purely represented by matrices Rsj. Regular tDMRG can now be continued by forming ψsr - 1sr = Asr - 1Usrωrx and sweeping back to the left of the CMW, which completes one time step of the adaptive update. Note that this protocol can also be performed using TEBD.

Non-adaptive time evolution to the left of the CMW can be performed similar to ref. [\cite=non_adapt]. Consider ĤL initially in a renormalized form ĤeffL with respect to the MPS matrices Lsj, obtained, e.g., from an initial DMRG calculation [\cite=idmrg1] [\cite=idmrg2]. The matrix HeffL is thus defined in a basis [formula] of the auxiliary space connecting [formula] and [formula]. We include [formula] in DMRG fashion to form [formula] in the block spin basis [formula]. [formula] is now updated by [formula] to get

[formula]

This update is non-adaptive because possible changes of the matrices Lsj are compressed to [formula]. The CMW however, when moving with vmax, will not be affected. The non-adaptive update can also be done by means of the renormalized imaginary-time transfer matrix, as in finite-temperature DMRG [\cite=XiangWangShibata]. An adaptive update with gauge transformation could be used as well, when the initial state is translationally invariant to the left. An even simpler alternative is to set l,l + 1 = 0, disconnecting the left part, with similar results.

The window is moved by vmax when known beforehand, or the movement is triggered by the change of some local observable or the bipartite entanglement at a sufficient distance from the right boundary. A shift of the CMW is done by including Rsr + 1 as a new rightmost matrix into the CMW, and by absorbing the leftmost matrix [formula] into the left side by using it to renormalize [formula]. Similar operations apply for an alternative shift by a whole iTEBD unit cell.

Results.

The spin-[formula] Transverse Field Ising model [\cite=Dutta10] [\cite=IgloiRieger00] [\cite=Rieger11] [\cite=Divakaran11] [\cite=Platini05] [\cite=Platini07] [\cite=Karevski02] [\cite=Rossini09] [\cite=Rossini11] [\cite=Foini11] on an infinite chain defined by [formula] can be diagonalized exactly [\cite=lsm] [\cite=amico] by means of a Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation [\cite=jw], but the time evolution of observables is in general very expensive to calculate [\cite=IgloiRieger00]. At h < hc = 0.5 there is long range order in Ŝx. We prepared the system in the symmetry broken ground state |0〉 with 〈Ŝxj〉 > 0 using iDMRG [\cite=idmrg1] [\cite=idmrg2]. As a local quantum quench we employed an initial JW excitation [formula] at site x0 inside the window, where [formula] are JW fermion creation and annihilation operators [\cite=jw]. It corresponds to a spin flip in z-direction at site x0 and a domain wall in x-direction between sites x0 - 1 and x0. We present data at h = 0.45, using τ = 0.002 and maximum matrix size 26.

The time evolution inside the CMW (Fig. [\ref=TFI_plot]) shows that boundary effects are indeed removed at both ends of the CMW. Window movement was triggered by entanglement, resulting in a window velocity of 0.455(4), equal to the maxmimum group velocity vmax = h of the TFI [\cite=Calabrese11]. When the window is not moved (Fig. [\ref=TFI_plot], inset), an impinging signal is absorbed by both boundaries temporarily, though reflections occur eventually. The entanglement entropy (not displayed) shows reflections at about t = 70 at both boundaries.

The agreement of the transverse magnetization in Fig. [\ref=TFI_plateaus](inset) with exact results which we calculated for the JW excitation is excellent, even at very large times, with relative deviations of less than O(10- 4) beyond the rear boundary. The transverse magnetization develops two shallow domain walls after the quench, with an overall scaling 〈Ŝz∞  -  Ŝzj(t)〉  ~  1 / t away from the signal front, as expected [\cite=IgloiRieger00] [\cite=Abraham70]. Close to the front, there are oscillations. The difference of the ground state magnetization and the first minimum numerically fits a power law ~  t- 1.127(8)≃t- 9 / 8.

For the longitudinal magnetization 〈Ŝxx(t)〉, analytical calculations are much more difficult, and results have been available in the literature only very recently[\cite=Calabrese11]. We find that shoulders appear during the time evolution, which develop into distinct magnetization plateaus, with a relative variation in 〈Ŝxx(t)〉 of less than 0.1% over 4 sites for the rightmost plateau in Fig. [\ref=TFI_plateaus]. The plateaus slowly widen over time. Analoguous steps have previously been observed in the XX chain [\cite=Hunyadi04], and with 〈Ŝz〉 in the paramagnetic phase of the TFI at h = 5 [\cite=Platini05]. Fig. [\ref=TFI_scaling] shows that the magnetizations at different times can be scaled to a single function 〈Ŝxx(t)〉  =  f((x - x0) / t) away from the front, similar to the behavior of 〈Ŝzx(t)〉 in Ref. [\cite=Platini05]. The plateaus close to the signal front are excellently described by a power law 〈Ŝx(t)〉  =  m  +  atb, where m = 0.4026(2),  b =  - 0.3497(6) for the first plateau and m = 0.3982(4),  b =  - 0.362(1) for the second one, with m = 0.406269 for the ground state. Their positions p obey (p - x0) / t  =  v  -  ctd with v = 0.4500(3),  c = 1.52(2),  d =  - 0.675(4), resp.  v = 0.4503(4),  c = 2.51(3),  d =  - 0.666(4). The exponents d are very close to - 2 / 3. We note that the velocities (p - j) / t converge to v = h = vmax to high precision making the slope in Fig. [\ref=TFI_scaling](left inset) sharper for larger times. The line of crossing points visible in the figure at large [formula] thus also converges to v = h. However, since d >  - 1, the positions of the plateaus move away from the signal front with a power law ~  td + 1  ≈  t1 / 3. The exponents are virtually unchanged within error bars for different fields h = 0.2,0.3,0.4 < hc (see also [\cite=IgloiRieger00]) and for a different quench without the local Ŝz flip.

Finally, we investigated the XXZ antiferromagnet [\cite=Barmettler09] [\cite=Barmettler10] [\cite=Langer09] [\cite=Langer11] [\cite=Lancaster10] [\cite=Pereira08] [\cite=Gobert05], [formula] using τ = 0.01 and matrix dimension 100. We prepared the system in the symmetry broken infinite size ground state at Jxy = 1,Jz =  - 3, with [formula]. At time 0 we flipped a spin at site x0, thereby producing two domain walls (spinons). During the time evolution, these domain walls spread in opposite directions (Fig. [\ref=XXZ]), forming a widening region with negative [formula] in between. We find vmax = 1.945(2) from the evolution of [formula]. Close to the initial excitation, the bipartite entanglement starts to grow considerably but within the CMW it stays small at later times. At large times t, distinct magnetization plateaus develop again, as shown in Fig. [\ref=XXZ_plateaus], with a relative variation of less than 0.1% over 6 sites for the rightmost plateau in the figure. Over time, they widen and move away slowly from the signal front (Fig. [\ref=XXZ_plateaus], inset). The plateaus do not follow power laws similar to the TFI. The scaling behavior in the XXZ model [\cite=Barmettler09] [\cite=Barmettler10] is currently under investigation.

Conclusions.

We have introduced a comoving window, employing an easy-to-implement gauge transformation in order to connect the CMW to its surroundings. We have shown that the CMW can follow the propagation of a signal front on an infinite size system unimpeded for very long simulation times. We note that even when the window is not moved, local signals can be simulated on the background of an infinite system, without perturbations which would otherwise emanate from the boundary. In this case the signal is temporarily absorbed by the boundary, though simulation times are eventually limited by the size of the window.

The CMW method is not restricted to evolution of excitations under uniform Hamiltonians. For example, the AKLT model [\cite=AKLT] with inhomogeneous bond interactions or 1D quantum systems under exponential or hyperbolic deformation [\cite=exp] [\cite=cosh] have uniform ground states, whereas the Hamiltonian is not uniform.

The CMW enabled us to calculate the relaxation after local quantum quenches in the Transverse Field Ising (TFI) model and in the XXZ antiferromagnet with low computational cost up to very large times. We have found distinct dynamical magnetization plateaus close to the signal front in both models. Their scaling is algebraic and well described in the TFI, whereas in the XXZ model it is more complicated and under current investigation.

Note added. During the preparation of this letter we learned that work on related approaches was being completed by two other groups [\cite=Ho] [\cite=Osborne].
