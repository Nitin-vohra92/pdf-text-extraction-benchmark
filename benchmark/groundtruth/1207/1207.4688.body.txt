Relativistic Orbits and the Zeros of [formula]

Introduction

For elliptic functions, Weierstrass' function [formula] is a very important tool. It appears in countless applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. There is some interest to determine its zeros. This problem is considered as being difficult. A formula can be found in [\cite=Eichler:Zagier], see also [\cite=McKean:Moll]. However, to quote ([\cite=McKean:Moll], p.105): "There seems to be no simple way to express the roots".

In this contribution a simple expression is given for the roots of [formula]. The formula follows from a formula for relativistic orbits (see [\cite=Huber2010Zarm] and [\cite=Huber2011mm]), which in turn originated from research in the field of Cauer filters [\cite=Huber2011]. We assume that the reader is familiar with elliptic function theory. We use the notation employed by Lawden [\cite=Lawden].

Relativistic Orbits

In Lawden's book ([\cite=Lawden], pp.126-129), it has been shown, that the generalisation of the Kepler ellipse to the relativistic orbit leads to the polar equation

[formula]

where r gives the distance of two bodies and Θ the angle in the plane of motion with suitable reference. As Lawden was mainly interested in deriving the perihel shift of the planet Mercury, he only determined approximations of the constants A, B, and C.

In [\cite=Huber2010Zarm] and [\cite=Huber2011] these constants have been determined exactly by explicitly solving the orbit differential equation for u = 1 / r given by

[formula]

The dash denotes derivation with respect to the angle Θ. The constants α and β depend on the motion to be considered (e.g. planetary motion, photonic motion, motion of elementary particles, etc.). This led to

[formula]

Note that the constant C is invariant to the transformation k2  →  k'2 = 1 - k2.

The shape for the relativistic motion (and for the magnitude of Cauerfilters) has two relevant constants, the value of k and the value of the product αβ. These two parameters essentially determine the trajectories (up to scaling).

Simple Expression for Zeros of [formula]

The orbit equation can be easily solved for the angle [formula]. We now show the relation of the orbit equation to the Weierstrass function [formula]. To this end we use the relation of [formula] to the sn2-function (see [\cite=Smirnow], p. 553)

[formula]

or

[formula]

i.e. [formula] and [formula]. The value C is given by equation ([\ref=eq:C]). The angle Θ then can be expressed by the integral

[formula]

where g2 and g3 are the Weierstrass invariants which follow from the differential equation

[formula]

and can be expressed as sum over all non-zero reciprocal 4-th and 6-th powers respectively of the lattice points of the adjoint parallelograms. The polynomial 4y3  -  g2  y  -  g3 factors as

[formula]

Thus with [formula], [formula], and e1 + e2 + e3 = 0 we get

[formula]

which leads to

[formula]

Using equation ([\ref=eq:C]) we obtain the remarkably simple result

[formula]

and

[formula]

To obtain a compact description of all cases we compute the discriminant of the polynomial 4y3 - g2y - g3 which is given by g32 - 27g23  =  16  (e1 - e2)2(e1 - e3)2(e2 - e3)2, thus g32 - 27g23  =  24(1 - k2)2k4C12 which leads to

[formula]

If the discriminant is greater than zero we have three real roots, if it is zero we have three real roots which are not all distinct and for negative discriminant we have one real and two complex zeros. The absolute invariant g32 / (27g23) follows as

[formula]

The absolute invariant transforms the three cases of the discriminant to the cases that g32 / (27g23) is greater, equal or smaller than 1. The absolute invariant is an extremely useful tool for characterizing the ratio of the two periods of the corresponding elliptic function. It is immediately seen that the absolute invariant is left unchanged by the transformations k2  →  k'2  =  1  -  k2 (like C) and k2  →  1 / k2.

The zeros of [formula] now follow from equation ([\ref=eq:Smirnow])

[formula]

hence the zeros of the Weierstrass function are given by the simple expression

[formula]

We give some examples.

Computing the length of the famous Lemniscate, one encounters the integral [formula] which can be transformed to the integral [formula]. Hence g2 = 4 and g3 = 0. The values of k2 follow from equation ([\ref=eq:absinv]). The possible values are k2 =  - 1, k2 = 1 / 2, and k2 = 2. We select the value of k2 in the interval

[formula]

In table I data for some values of k used in the following examples are collected. All numeric values for Θ0 given in the examples are for the parallelogram around zero.

Let g2 = 7, g3 = 3, and [formula] (see table I). This leads to

[formula]

Let g2 = 11, g3 = 7, and [formula]. This leads to

[formula]

Let g2 = 15, [formula], and [formula]. This leads to

[formula]

We may also use the property

[formula]

to obtain additional solutions from known values of g2 and g3 for any λ  ≠  0.

Using λ = 21 / 12, we get the zeros of the Weierstrass function for the case g2 = 15  /  21 / 3 and g3 = 7 from the previous example as

[formula]

In general for given g2 and g3 we can easily compute k from equation ([\ref=eq:absinv]). Using the substitution ξ = k2 + 1 / k2 - 1 we get a polynomial of degree three in ξ which can be solved for ξ from which k2 and k follows. Namely we get the polynomial

[formula]

where  [formula], which solved for ξ yields

[formula]

with ρ∈{1,ei2π  /  3,ei4π  /  3}. Then all values of k2 follow:

[formula]

If a real solution for k2 in the interval

[formula]

Conclusion

The simple and easy to compute expression

[formula]

for the zeros of the Weierstrass elliptic function [formula] has been derived, where k is given in closed form as function of g2 and g3.
