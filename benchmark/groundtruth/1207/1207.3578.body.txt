Equitable chromatic threshold of complete multipartite graphs

Introduction

All graphs considered in this paper are finite, undirected and without loops or multiple edges. For a positive integer k, let [formula]. A proper k-coloring of a graph G is a mapping f:V(G)  →  [k] such that f(x)  ≠  f(y) whenever xy∈E(G). We call the set f- 1(i) = {x∈V(G):f(x)  =  i} a color class for each i∈[k]. A graph is k-colorable if it has a k-coloring. The chromatic number of G, denoted by χ(G), is equal to min{k : G is k-colorable}. An equitable k-coloring of G is a k-coloring for which any two color classes differ in size by at most one, or equivalently, each color class is of size ⌊|V(G)| / k⌋ or ⌈|V(G)| / k⌉. If G has n vertices, we write n  =  kq  +  r with 0  ≤  r  <  k, then we can rewrite n  =  (k - r)q  +  r(q  +  1), or equivalently, exactly r (respectively, k  -  r) color classes have size q  +  1 (respectively, q). The equitable chromatic number of G, denoted by χ=(G), is equal to min{k : G is equitably k-colorable }, and the equitable chromatic threshold of a graph G, denoted by χ*=(G), is equal to min {t : G is equitably k-colorable for k  ≥  t}.

The concept of equitable colorability was first introduced by Meyer [\cite=W._Meyer1973]. The definitive survey of the subject is by Lih [\cite=K.-W._Lih1998]. Many application such as scheduling and constructing timetables, please see [\cite=B.Baker1996] [\cite=S._Irani1996] [\cite=S._Janson2002] [\cite=F._Kitagawa1988] [\cite=M.J._Pelsmajer2004] [\cite=B.F._Smith1996] [\cite=A._Tucker1973].

In 1964, Erds [\cite=P._Erdos1964] conjectured that any graph G with maximum degree Δ(G)  ≤  k has an equitable (k  +  1)-coloring, or equivalently, χ*=(G)  ≤  Δ(G)  +  1. This conjecture was proved in 1970 by Hajnal and Szemerédi [\cite=A._Hajnal1970] with a long and complicated proof, a polynomial algorithm for such a coloring was found by Mydlarz and Szemerédi [\cite=M._MydlarzManuscript]. Kierstead and Kostochka [\cite=H.A._Kierstead2008] gave a short proof of the theorem, and presented another polynomial algorithm for such a coloring. Brooks' type results are conjectured: Equitable Coloring Conjecture [\cite=W._Meyer1973] χ=(G)  ≤  Δ(G), and Equitable Δ-Coloring Conjecture [\cite=B.-L._Chen1994b] χ*=(G)  ≤  Δ(G) for G∉{Kn,C2n + 1,K2n + 1,2n + 1}. Exact values of equitable chromatic numbers of trees [\cite=B.-L._Chen1994a] and complete multipartite graphs [\cite=D.Blum2003], [\cite=P.C.B._Lam2001] were determined. Our article determines the exact value of equitable chromatic threshold of complete multipartite graphs.

The formula which is different from ours was established independently in a manuscript by Chen and Wu, and was reported in [\cite=K.-W._Lih1998]. However, Chen and Wu never published their proof. To our knowledge, this article contains the only published proof.

The results

Before stating our main result, we need several preliminary results on integer partitions. Recall that a partition of an integer n is a sum of the form [formula], where 0  ≤  mi  ≤  n for each 0  ≤  i  ≤  k. We call such a partition a q-partition if each mi is in the set {q,q + 1}. A q-partition of n is typically denoted as n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1), where n is the sum of a q's and b q  +  1's. A q-partition of n is called a minimal q-partition if the number of its addends, a  +  b, is as small as possible. A q-partition of n is called a maximal q-partition if the number of its addends, a  +  b, is as large as possible. For example, 2  +  2  +  2  +  2 is a maximal 2-partition of 8, and 2  +  3  +  3 is a minimal 2-partition of 8. If q|n, or equivalently, n  =  kq, with k  ≥  1, thus we write n  =  0(q - 1)  +  kq (respectively, n  =  kq  +  0(q  +  1)), then there are both (q  -  1)-partition and q-partition of n. For example, since 2|8, we write 8  =  0  ×  1  +  4  ×  2 (respectively, 8  =  4  ×  2  +  0  ×  3), then there are both 1-partition and 2-partition of 8.

Our first lemma is from [\cite=D.Blum2003], which study the condition of which a q-partition of n exists. For the sake of completeness, here we restate their proof. In what follows, all variables are nonegative integers.

[\cite=D.Blum2003] If 0  <  q  ≤  n, and n = kq + r with 0  ≤  r  <  q, then there is a q-partition of n if and only if r  ≤  k.

If r  ≤  k, then n  =  (k  -  r)q  +  r(q  +  1) is a q-partition of n. Conversely, given a q-partition n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) of n, we have n  =  (a  +  b)q  +  b, so (a  +  b)  ≤  k and r  ≤  b. Consequently, r  ≤  b  ≤  (a  +  b)  ≤  k.

There is no q-partition of n if and only if n / (q  +  1) > ⌊n / q⌋.

Using the division algorithm, write n  =  kq  +  r, with 0  ≤  r  <  q. Then k  =  ⌊n / q⌋, and r  =  n  -  ⌊n / q⌋q. Lemma [\ref=basic] implies that there is no q-partition of n if and only if r > k, hence n  -  ⌊n / q⌋q  >  ⌊n / q⌋, we can rewrite n  >  ⌊n / q⌋(q  +  1). The Corollary [\ref=noq-partion] follows immediately.

The next two lemmas give conditions under which a q-partition of n is maximal (respectively, minimal).

A q-partition n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) of n is maximal if and only if b  <  q. Moreover a maximal q-partition is unique.

Regard a and b as variables, and q as fixed. Solving the linear relation n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) for a yields a  +  b = (n  -  b) / q. Thus a  +  b is a strictly decreasing function of b, and moreover a  +  b decreases as b increases. Therefore, the q-partition n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) will be maximal exactly when b is the smallest non-negative integer for which (n  -  b) / q is an integer. Once b is fixed, a is determined by the equation n = aq  +  b(q  +  1). Uniqueness of maximal q-partition follows.

Now suppose n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) is a q-partition, and b  <  q. By what was said in the previous paragraph, m  =  (n  -  b) / q is an integer. If the partition is not maximal, then there are integers [formula] and [formula], with [formula] and [formula], for which [formula]. Subtracting [formula] from n  =  mq  +  b gives [formula], so [formula].

Conversely, if n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) is a maximal q-partition of n, it is impossible for b  ≥  q, for otherwise n  =  (a  +  q  +  1)q  +  (b  -  q)(q  +  1) is a q-partition of n with a  +  q  +  1  +  b  -  q  =  a  +  b  +  1 addends, contradicting maximality. Thus, b  <  q.

[\cite=D.Blum2003] A q-partition n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) of n is minimal if and only if a  <  q  +  1. Moreover a minimal q-partition is unique.

Now it is possible to describe exactly the number of addends in a maximal (respectively, minimal) q-partition.

If n = aq  +  b(q  +  1) is a minimal q-partition, then a  +  b  =  ⌈n / (q  +  1)⌉. If [formula] is a maximal q-partition, then [formula]. Moreover, when ⌈n / (q  +  1)⌉  =  ⌊n / q⌋, there is only one q-partition of n.

If n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) is a minimal q-partition, then a  +  b  =  (n  +  a) / (q  +  1), with a  <  q  +  1 by Lemma [\ref=minimal1], and so a  +  b  =  ⌈n / (q  +  1)⌉. If [formula] is a maximal q-partition, then [formula], with [formula] by Lemma[\ref=maximal1], and so [formula]. Now, if ⌈n / (q  +  1)⌉  =  ⌊n / q⌋, then [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=minimal1] and Lemma [\ref=maximal1], we know that the minimal (respectively, maximal) q-partition is unique. Consequently, if ⌈n / (q  +  1)⌉  =  ⌊n / q⌋, then there is only one q-partition of n.

Let n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) be the maximal q-partition, and [formula] be the minimal (q  -  1)-partition. If q|n then [formula], otherwise, [formula].

By Lemma [\ref=minandmax1], if n  =  aq  +  b(q  +  1) is the maximal q-partition, then a  +  b  =  ⌊n / q⌋. If [formula] is the minimal (q  -  1)-partition, Lemma [\ref=minandmax1] implies that [formula]. Consequently, if q|n then [formula], otherwise, [formula].

If n1  =  a1q  +  b1(q  +  1), and n2  =  a2q  +  b2(q  +  1) are maximal q-partition of n1 and n2, respectively. If [formula], and [formula] are minimal (q  -  1)-partition of n1 and n2, respectively. Lemma [\ref=minandmax2] implies that

[formula]

These results now combine to give a construction of a minimal equitable coloring of [formula] and a method to change the color classes step by step, so that we can increase the equitable colors one by one. In words, we must give the computation of the minimum t, when [formula] can be equitably k-colorable for k  ≥  t.

Denote the partite sets of the graph [formula] as [formula], with |Ni| = ni. Any given color class of an equitable coloring must lie entirely in some Ni, for otherwise two of its vertices are nonadjacent. Thus, any equitable coloring partitions each Ni into color classes [formula], no two of which differ in size by more than one. If the sizes of the color classes are in the set {q,q + 1}, then these sizes induce q-partitions of each ni. Conversely, given a number q, and q-partitions ni  =  aiq  +  bi(q  +  1), of each ni, there is an equitable coloring of [formula] with color sizes q and q + 1; just partition each Ni into ai sets of size q, and bi sets of q + 1. It follows, then, that finding an equitable coloring of [formula] amounts to finding a number q, and simultaneous q-partitions of each of numbers ni. By Corollary [\ref=noq-partion], a necessary condition for q is that ni / (q  +  1)  ≤  ⌊ni / q⌋ for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. If we want increase colors one by one, q must be chosen with the additional property that the total number of color classes is as small as possible. By Lemmas [\ref=basic], [\ref=minandmax1] and [\ref=minandmax2], it suffices to choose the minimum q for which there is i such that ni / (q  +  1)  >  ⌊ni / q⌋ or there are ni and nj , such that q divides neither ni nor nj . Equivalently, it suffices to choose the maximum q  -  1 for which there is i such that ni / q  ≤  ⌊ni / (q  -  1)⌋, and (q  -  1)|nj , for j  ≠  i. Moreover we can partition each ni into ai  =  q⌈ni / q⌉  -  ni of sizes q  -  1, and bi  =  ni  -  ⌈ni / q⌉(q  -  1) of sizes q.

[formula], where h = min{q : there is i such that ni / (q  +  1)  >  ⌊ni / q⌋ or there are ni and nj, i  ≠  j, such that q divides neither ni nor nj}.

We prove that [formula] is equitably k-colorable for any [formula] by induction on k.

First, we prove that [formula] is equitably [formula]-colorable. Set [formula], by the definition of h, [formula], for 1  ≤  i  ≤  l. Corollary [\ref=noq-partion] implies that each ni has an [formula]-partition. Let [formula] be the minimal [formula]-partition of each ni. By Lemma [\ref=minandmax1], [formula], and hence we get an equitable [formula]-coloring of [formula]. It is straightforward to check that [formula] is equitably [formula]-colorable.

Now, we assume that [formula] is equitably k-colorable for some [formula]. It suffices to prove [formula] is equitably (k  +  1)-colorable.

By the assumption, each ni has a q-partition ni  =  aiq  +  bi(q + 1) such that [formula].

Claim 1 0  ≤  q  ≤  h  -  1  <  h.

Suppose to the contrary that q  ≥  h. By Lemma [\ref=minandmax1], ai + bi  ≤  ⌊ni / q⌋, and hence [formula]. By the definition of h, there are ni and nj, i  ≠  j, such that h divides neither ni nor nj, or there is some ni such that ni / (h  +  1)  >  ⌊ni / h⌋. Either case implies that [formula] for some ni. Hence [formula]. This is a contradiction to [formula]. The claim follows.

To prove [formula] is equitably (k + 1)-colorable, we consider two cases.

Case 1: There is some ni such that whose q-partition ni  =  aiq  +  bi(q + 1) is not maximal. By Lemma [\ref=maximal1], bi  ≥  q, so we can rewrite ni  =  (ai  +  q  +  1)q  +  (bi  -  q)(q + 1). Thus there is a q-partition of ni with ai  +  q  +  1  +  bi  -  q  =  ai  +  1  +  bi addends. Hence, we get an equitable (k  +  1)-coloring of [formula].

Case 2: Each q-partition ni  =  aiq  +  bi(q + 1) is maximal. By Claim 1, 0  ≤  q  ≤  h  -  1  <  h, the definition of h implies that q divides ni for all i with at most one exception.

Subcase 2.1: There is no i such that [formula], in other words, q|ni for all i. By Lemma [\ref=minandmax2], each maximal q-partition is the minimal (q - 1)-partition of ni. Since 0  ≤  q  -  1  ≤  h  -  2  <  h, it implies that q  -  1 divides ni for all i with at most one exception. Consequently, there is some nj such that (q  -  1)|nj and q|nj, and the number of addends of minimal (respectively, maximal) (q - 1)-partition is equal to ⌈nj / q⌉  =  nj / q (respectively, ⌊nj / (q - 1)⌋  =  nj / (q  -  1)) by Lemma [\ref=minandmax1]. Since nj / (q - 1)  >  nj / q, the minimal (q - 1)-partition is not the maximal (q - 1)-partition of nj. Thus, the minimal (q - 1)-partition of nj is just not maximal. So it turn into case 1. So we can obtain an equitable (k  +  1)-coloring of [formula].

Subcase 2.2: There is exactly an i such that [formula], and at the same time, q|nj for j  ≠  i, with 1  ≤  j  ≤  l. By Lemma [\ref=minandmax2], each maximal q-partition of nj is the minimal (q - 1)-partition of nj. Since [formula], and q  <  h, by the definition of h, ni / q  ≤  ⌊ni / (q  -  1)⌋. Corollary [\ref=noq-partion] implies that ni has a (q  -  1)-partition. Let the partition ni  =  aiq  +  bi(q + 1) (respectively, the partition [formula]) be the maximal q-partition (respectively, the minimal (q  -  1)-partition) of ni, the number of addends [formula] is equal to ai  +  bi  +  1 by Lemma [\ref=minandmax1]. So we obtain an equitable k + 1-coloring of [formula].

In a word ,we has proved that [formula].

Next we prove that [formula] is not equitably ([formula]-colorable.

Suppose to the contrary that [formula] is equitably ([formula]-colorable. Then, each ni has a q-partition ni  =  aiq  +  bi(q + 1) such that [formula].

Claim 2 q  =  h

First, we prove that q  ≥  h. Suppose to the contrary that q  ≤  h - 1  <  h. By Lemma [\ref=minandmax1], (ai  +  bi)  ≥  ⌈ni / (q + 1)⌉, thus [formula]. This is a contradiction to [formula]. Second, we prove that q  ≤  h. Suppose to the contrary that q  >  h. Lemma [\ref=minandmax1] implies that (ai  +  bi)  ≤  ⌊ni / q⌋  <  ⌊ni / h⌋. By the definition of h, there is some ni such that [formula], clearly, ⌈ni / h⌉  -  1  =  ⌊ni / h⌋. Thus, [formula]. This is a contradiction to [formula]. The claim follows.

Now, we consider two cases of h.

case 1: h = min{q : there is i such that ni / (q  +  1)  >  ⌊ni / q⌋ }. By Corollary [\ref=noq-partion], there is no h-partition of ni. It is contrary to that each ni is partitioned into sets of the sizes h or h + 1.

case 2: h = min{q : there are ni and nj, i  ≠  j, such that q divides neither ni nor nj}. Let [formula], [formula] be the minimal (h  -  1)-partition of ni and nj, respectively. Let ni  =  aih  +  bi(h  +  1), nj  =  ajh  +  bj(h  +  1) be the maximal h-partition of ni and nj, respectively. Lemma[\ref=minandmax2] implies that [formula]. And hence, [formula]. Consequently ,we can not obtain an equitable ([formula])-coloring of [formula].

Therefore, [formula], and so [formula].

Theorem [\ref=theorem1] leads immediately to an algorithm which finds the minimal equitable coloring of [formula] such that we can increase the colors one by one, through we adjust the partition of ni step by step.

Equitable Chromatic threshold algorithm

Let [formula] be a complete multipartite graph, where the partite sets of the graph [formula] are denoted as [formula], with |Ni| = ni. Let s* = min{s*i, where s*i is the minimum positive integer such that [formula]}.

(0) Set h  =  s*.

(1) If there are ni and nj, such that h divides neither ni nor nj, with i  ≠  j, stop. Otherwise, go to (2).

(2) There is i such that [formula], and h|nj with i  ≠  j. If ni / (h  +  1)  >  ⌊ni / h⌋ , stop. Otherwise, go to (3).

(3) Let h  =  h  +  1, go to (1).

The equitable Chromatic threshold of [formula] is [formula]. Notice that the complexity of the algorithm is linear in [formula].

According Theorem [\ref=theorem1], we have the following corollary which is a W.-H. Lin's[\cite=W.-H._Lin2010] result.

[\cite=W.-H._Lin2010] If integers n  ≥  1 and r  ≥  2, then [formula], where s* is the minimum positive integer such that [formula].
