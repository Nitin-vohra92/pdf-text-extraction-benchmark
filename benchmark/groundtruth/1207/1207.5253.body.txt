Symplectic mean curvature flows in Kähler surfaces with positive holomorphic sectional curvatures

Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study the mean curvature flow in Kähler surfaces with positive holomorphic sectional curvatures. We prove that if the ratio of the maximum and the minimum of the holomorphic sectional curvatures is less than 2, then there exists a positive constant δ depending on the ratio such that cos α  ≥  δ is preserved along the flow.

Introduction

Mean curvature flows were studied by many authors, for example Huisken ([\cite=H1], [\cite=H2]), Ecker-Huisken ([\cite=EH]), Huisken-Sinestrari [\cite=HS], Carlo Ilmanen [\cite=I], Neves [\cite=N], Smoczyk ([\cite=Sm1]), Wang ([\cite=W]), White [\cite=Wa], etc.

In this paper we mainly concentrated on the symplectic mean curvature flows, which were studied by Chen -Tian [\cite=CT], Chen-Li [\cite=CL1], Chen-Li-Tian [\cite=CLT], Wang [\cite=W], Han-Li [\cite=HL], [\cite=HL3], [\cite=HL2], Han-Sun [\cite=HS], Han-Li-Sun [\cite=HLS], and Han-Li-Yang [\cite=HLY]. The basic fact is that the symplectic property is preserved by the mean curvature flow if the ambient space M is Kähler-Einstein, or if the ambient Kähler surface evolves along the Kähler-Ricci flow [\cite=HL2].

Let [formula] be a Kähler surface. For a compact oriented real surface Σ which is smoothly immersed in M, the Kähler angle [\cite=CW] α of Σ in M was defined by

[formula]

where dμΣ is the area element of Σ in the induced metric from [formula]. We say that Σ is a symplectic surface if cos α  >  0; Σ is a holomorphic curve if [formula].

Given an immersed F0:Σ  →  M, we consider a one-parameter family of smooth maps Ft = F(  ·  ,t):Σ  →  M with corresponding images Σt = Ft(Σ) immersed in M and F satisfies the mean curvature flow equation:

[formula]

where H(x,t) is the mean curvature vector of Σt at F(x,t) in M.

Choose an orthonormal basis {e1,e2,e3,e4} on (M,[formula]) along Σt such that {e1,e2} is the basis of Σt and the symplectic form ωt takes the form

[formula]

where {u1,u2,u3,u4} is the dual basis of {e1,e2,e3,e4}. Then along the surface Σt the complex structure on M takes the form ([\cite=CL1])

[formula]

Recall the evolution equation of the Kähler angle along the mean curvature flow deduced in [\cite=HL2],

The evolution equation for cos α along Σt is

[formula]

Here

[formula]

We want to see whether the symplectic property is preserved along the mean curvature flow. In the case that M is a Kähler-Einstein surface, we have Ric(Je1,e2) =  cos α, where [formula] is the scalar curvature of M, so the symplectic property is preserved. If the ambient Kähler surface evolves along the Kähler-Ricci flow, Han-Li [\cite=HL2] derived the evolution equation for cos α and consequently they showed that the symplectic property is also preserved. In this paper, we find another condition to assure that along the flow, at each time the surface is symplectic. Note that we don't require M to be Einstein. Denote the minimum and maximum of holomorphic sectional curvatures of M by k1 and k2. We state our main theorem as follows:

Main Theorem Suppose M is a Kähler surface with positive holomorphic sectional curvatures. Set [formula]. If the flow satisfies either

I. [formula] and [formula],

or

II. [formula] and [formula],

then along the flow

[formula]

where C is a positive constant depending only on k1, k2 and δ. As a corollary, min Σt cos α is increasing with respect to t. In particular, at each time t, Σt is symplectic. Therefore, we call this flow the symplectic mean curvature flow.

Since we obtain ([\ref=my_alpha]), many theorems in "symplectic mean curvature flows in Kähler-Einstein surfaces" still hold in our case. For example,

Arguing as in [\cite=CW] by strong maximum principle, we have

I. Suppose M is a Kähler surface with positive holomorphic sectional curvatures and [formula], then every symplectic minimal surface satisfying

[formula]

in M is a holomorphic curve.

II. Suppose M is a Kähler surface with positive holomorphic sectional curvatures and [formula], then every symplectic minimal surface satisfying

[formula]

in M is a holomorphic curve.

Arguing exactly in the same way as in [\cite=CL1] or [\cite=W], we have

Under the same condition of the Main Theorem, the symplectic mean curvature flow has no type I singularity at any T > 0.

Curvature Tensor, Sectional Curvature and Holomorphic Sectional Curvature

Denote the curvature tensor of M by K. Set K(X) = K(X,JX,X,JX) and K(X,Y) = K(X,Y,X,Y), where X,Y are arbitrary vector fields on M. It is known that (c.f. [\cite=BGG], [\cite=V]) we can express the sectional curvatures by holomorphic sectional curvatures.

The sectional curvatures of M can be determined by the holomorphic sectional curvatures by

[formula]

Using ([\ref=sectional]), it is easy to check that,

For any vector fields X, Y and Z on M,

[formula]

Denote the minimum and the maximum of sectional curvatures by Kmin and Kmax respectively, we have the following estimates.

Kmin and Kmax satisfy

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof. Given any point p∈M and any two unit orthogonal vectors X and Y at p, we can find two vectors Z and W such that {X,Y,Z,W} form an orthonormal basis of TpM. Suppose JX = yY + zZ + wW, then

[formula]

and

[formula]

Assume the Kähler form is anti-self-dual, it was shown in [\cite=HLY] that, y2 + z2 + w2 = 1 and J has the form

[formula]

Combining ([\ref=sectional]) with ([\ref=X+JY]) and ([\ref=X-JY]), we get

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

This proves the theorem. Q.E.D.

Proof of the Main Theorem

In this section, we will prove the Main Theorem of this paper.

Proof of the Main Theorem. In order to prove this theorem, we need to estimate Ric(Je1,e2). Using two different methods, we get two available estimates. We now deduce the first one.

[formula]

where

[formula]

By ([\ref=sectional]), we have

[formula]

By our choice of the complex structure ([\ref=J]), we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Hence K2121 can be estimated by k1 and k2,

[formula]

Similarly, we get

[formula]

and

[formula]

Putting ([\ref=2121]), ([\ref=2323]) and ([\ref=2424]) into ([\ref=22]), we obtain that

[formula]

Using ([\ref=xyxz]) and ([\ref=J]), we can also estimate K3121 and K3424. We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Adding ([\ref=3121]) and ([\ref=3424]) yields

[formula]

By a similar computation in the opposite direction, we get

[formula]

Therefore by ([\ref=Ric]), ([\ref=R22]), ([\ref=31213424]) and short time existence of the mean curvature flow, we have

[formula]

If 1  ≤  λ < 2 and [formula], then the RHS of ([\ref=positive]) is positive.

Another estimate follows directly from Theorem [\ref=K] and Berger��s inequality (c.f. [\cite=G]) that

[formula]

Putting the above estimate into () yields

[formula]

It follows that if 1  ≤  λ < 2 and [formula], then the RHS of ([\ref=positive]) is positive. Note that

[formula]

for [formula], and

[formula]

for [formula], we get the conclusion. Q.E.D.
