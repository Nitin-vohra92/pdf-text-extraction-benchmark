An expansion formula for the inversions and excedances in the symmetric group

Introduction

Let [formula] be the set of permutations on [formula]. For [formula], the entry i∈[n] is called an excedance (resp. drop) of σ if i  <  σ(i) (resp. i  >  σ(i)); the entry i∈[n] is called a descent of σ if i < n and σ(i) > σ(i + 1). Denote the number of descents, excedances and drops in σ by [formula], [formula] and [formula], respectively. It is well known [\cite=FS70] that the statistics [formula], [formula] and [formula] have the same distribution on [formula], their common enumerative polynomial is called the Eulerian polynomial:

[formula]

and there are nonnegative integers γn,j such that

[formula]

In the last years several q-analogues of [\eqref=eq:peaka] were established in [\cite=SW10] [\cite=HJZ12] [\cite=SZ12] by combining one of the Eulerian statistics in [\eqref=eq:eulerian] and the Major index. Let [formula] be the number of inversions in [formula]. The following q-Eulerian polynomial

[formula]

was first studied in [\cite=CSZ97]. Recently, Blanco and Petersen [\cite=BP12] has conjectured that Sn(q,t) would display a nice q-version of [\eqref=eq:peaka].

There exist polynomials γn,k(q) with nonegative integer coefficients such that:

[formula]

The aim of this paper is to show that a stronger version of the above conjecture was implicitly given in [\cite=SZ10] [\cite=SZ12].

Prelimaries

For [formula], the statistic [formula] (resp. [formula] ) is the number of pairs (i,j) such that 2  ≤  i < j  ≤  n and σ(i - 1) > σ(j) > σ(i) (resp. σ(i - 1) < σ(j) < σ(i)). Similarly, the statistic [formula] (resp. [formula]) is the number of pairs (i,j) such that 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n - 1 and σ(j + 1) > σ(i) > σ(j) (resp. σ(j + 1) < σ(i) < σ(j)). Define the generalized Eulerian polynomial by

[formula]

For [formula], the value σ(i), for i∈[n], is called

a valley if σ(i - 1)  >  σ(i) and σ(i)  <  σ(i + 1);

a double descent if σ(i - 1)  >  σ(i) and σ(i)  >  σ(i + 1).

where σ(0) = σ(n + 1) = 0 by convention. Let [formula] be the subset of permutations [formula] with exactly k valleys and without double descents. Define the polynomial

[formula]

The following lemma is a special case of Theorem 2 in [\cite=SZ12].

We have the expansion formula

[formula]

Moreover, for all [formula], the following divisibility holds

[formula]

For a permutation [formula] the crossing and nesting numbers are defined by

[formula]

For example, if the permutation is [formula], there are three crossings (1 < 2 < σ(1) < σ(2)), (1 < 3  ≤  σ(1) < σ(3)), (7 > 4 > σ(7) > σ(4)) and three nestings (2 < 3 < σ(3) < σ(2)), (5 > 4 > σ(4) > σ(5)), (7 > 6 > σ(6) > σ(7)), thus [formula].

The following lemma is a special case of Theorem 5 in [\cite=SZ12].

There is a bijection Φ on [formula] such that for all [formula] we have

[formula]

The following lemma is proved in [\cite=SZ12] using continued fractions of their generating functions.

The triple statistics [formula] and [formula] are equidistributed on [formula].

Proof of the conjecture

We first state a more precise version of Conjecture 1.

The Conjecture 1 holds true. Moreover, for 0  ≤  k  ≤  (n - 1) / 2,

[formula]

and γn,k(q) is divisible by qk(1 + q)k.

Since [formula] and [formula] for any [formula], we have

[formula]

Combining Lemmas 3 and 4 yields

[formula]

Therefore, as [formula] (see [\cite=SZ10]), we deduce

[formula]

The desired result follows then from Lemma 2.
