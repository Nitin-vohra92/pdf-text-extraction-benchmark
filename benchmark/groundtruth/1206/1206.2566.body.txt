The Boson-Hubbard Model on a Kagome Lattice with Sextic Ring-Exchange Terms

=10000 =10000

Interest in ring-exchange interactions in quantum many-body systems has a long history originating from the study of quantum solids, a typical example being solid Helium-3  [\cite=Thouless] [\cite=Herring]. Recently the study of ring-exchange interactions has resurged with boson and spin models [\cite=Balents] [\cite=Paramekanti] [\cite=Sandvik] [\cite=Rousseau1] [\cite=Melko] [\cite=Rousseau2]. In particular, multiple particle exchange has been suggested as a possible candidate to induce a normal "Bose metal" or "Bose liquid" phase at zero temperature, in which there are no broken symmetries associated with superfluidity or charge density wave phases [\cite=Paramekanti] [\cite=Hermele] [\cite=Nikolic] [\cite=Nikolic-2005]. Studies on a square lattice with four-site ring-exchange plaquettes suggest that ordered phases always dominate [\cite=Sandvik] [\cite=Melko] [\cite=Rousseau1] [\cite=Rousseau2]. However, these results still leave the possibility that a Bose liquid or spin liquid phase may exist in certain frustrated lattices [\cite=Balents] [\cite=Dang].

Here we explore a frustrated kagome lattice built from corner sharing triangles in two dimensions. The most important characteristic of highly frustrated quantum systems is their ground state degeneracy in the classical limit [\cite=Villain-1979] [\cite=Diep]. In such systems the classical ground state manifold, which is given by the least frustrated Ising spin configurations, results in local constraints in each unit. One of the prominent problems in frustrated quantum magnetism is whether quantum fluctuations partially alleviate the classical ground state degeneracy via the order-by-disorder mechanism or by forming a quantum spin liquid driven by quantum fluctuations [\cite=Villain-1980] [\cite=Shender] [\cite=Diep]. A natural route to study this problem is to construct an effective theory for the low energy quantum fluctuations which is confined to the Hilbert space of the degenerate classical ground state manifold. From the strong coupling perturbation theory, the leading term for the quantum fluctuations involves multiple-spin loop flips which form the ring-exchange term. For kagome and pyrochlore lattices, the smallest ring-exchange term appears at the sixth order [\cite=Nikolic-2005] [\cite=Hermele] [\cite=Shannon]. Therefore, the study of quantum fluctuations on some of the most important highly frustrated lattices naturally involves effective models with multiple-spin ring-exchange.

Recently those ring-exchange models have been formulated in terms of gauge theories [\cite=Hermele] [\cite=Nikolic] [\cite=Neto]. The gauge theory formulation is essentially the manifestation of the constraint for the projected Hilbert space within the classical degenerate manifold, and the effective gauge theory is, in turn, studied by a duality mapping. Various phases have been proposed for different models based on this type of calculations.

It is extremely important to have a systematic unbiased numerical method to test the various proposals for exotic ordered valence bond and disordered spin liquid phases. However, numerical studies on those models have proved to be rather difficult. There are some recent studies using the World-line and the Stochastic Series Expansion algorithms with loop update schemes on four-site ring-exchange models [\cite=Rousseau1] [\cite=Sandvik] [\cite=Melko] [\cite=Rousseau2]. For these models, ring-exchange interactions are described by a term that performs a correlated hopping of two particles in opposite directions, with no contribution to the winding. Thus one can expect the superfluidity to be destroyed when this term is dominant. However, instead of the proposed Bose liquid phase, these exact studies have found charge density waves, valence bond solids, or phase separation.

The model we consider in this work consists of hard-core bosons on a two-dimensional kagome lattice (Fig. [\ref=KagomeLattice]). The underlying Bravais lattice is spanned by the basis vectors [formula] with lengths chosen as unity, and the kagome lattice is obtained by duplicating a set of three sites [formula], [formula], [formula] (gray symbols). The reciprocal lattice is spanned by the vectors [formula], each with length [formula].

The Hamiltonian takes the form (we use periodic boundary conditions)

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the creation and annihilation operators of a hard-core boson on site i. These operators satisfy fermionic anti-commutation rules when acting on the same site, a2i = 0, [formula], [formula], and bosonic commutation rules when acting on different sites, [formula], [formula], [formula]. The usual kinetic term allows the particles to hop between near-neighboring sites i and j. A sextic ring-exchange term allows three particles to perform a correlated hopping within the same hexagon, with the [formula] over all hexagons. We study the model as a function of filling factor and K / t.

This model can be mapped to the U(1) lattice gauge theory with a softened hard-core constraint, which plays a crucial role in the study of quantum fluctuations in some highly frustrated models [\cite=Hermele] [\cite=Nikolic-2005]. Notably, similar models can possibly be realized in optical lattices with dipolar bosons [\cite=Tewari]. Since the sextic ring-exchange term couples six different sites at a time, an analytical treatment of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Hamiltonian]) is rather complicated [\cite=Nikolic-2005] [\cite=Hermele]. On the other hand, most current quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods used on a square lattice [\cite=Rousseau1] [\cite=Sandvik] [\cite=Melko] [\cite=Rousseau2] need to decompose the Hamiltonian as a sum of two-site coupling terms, which is not possible in our case. These methods need such a decomposition because they use a loop update that consists of building a closed path in space and imaginary time, and raising or lowering the occupation number of the sites that are visited. By construction, these loops can update only one or two sites at a time, and are therefore suitable only for one-site or two-site coupling terms. In brief, the treatment of fourth order ring-exchange terms in previous studies required some special developments [\cite=Sandvik] [\cite=Rousseau2] that are not easy to generalize to sixth or higher order.

However, the Stochastic Green Function (SGF) algorithm [\cite=SGF] [\cite=DirectedUpdate] with global space-time update [\cite=GlobalSpaceTimeUpdate] does not make use of such loop updates, instead, it performs a direct sampling of the partition function by distributing Hamiltonian terms randomly in space and imaginary time. No particular decomposition of the Hamiltonian is required. Therefore the update procedure is totally independent of the structure of the Hamiltonian, and can be applied to any n-site coupling term with efficiency. In this work, we use the SGF algorithm and perform simulations of systems with sizes up to [formula] hexagons (972 sites).

While the SGF algorithm is designed to work in the canonical ensemble (CE), an extension [\cite=GlobalSpaceTimeUpdate] allows us to simulate the grand-canonical ensemble (GCE). In the following we take advantage of this flexibility. We find convenient to use the GCE for studying the stability of the system. However, it is much easier to use the CE on parameter regions where the system is stable only at specific densities. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that an unbiased QMC method allows the simulation of sixth order coupling terms in both the CE and GCE at both finite and essentially zero temperature. For the GCE we add the usual term -  μN to the Hamiltonian ([\ref=Hamiltonian]), where μ is the chemical potential and N is the total particle number operator. In the CE μ is not a control parameter, but it is measured at zero temperature as μ(N) = E(N + 1) - E(N), where [formula] and N is the controlled number of particles.

In the following, we show that the model contains valence bond solids at densities [formula] and [formula] when the ring-exchange term is dominant. For our study, we will consider the superfluid density

[formula]

where β is the inverse temperature and Ŵ1 and Ŵ2 are the winding numbers measured in the two directions [formula] and [formula]. We also consider the structure factor [formula], with

[formula]

where L is the linear system size (counting hexagons), ρ is the density, [formula] is the number operator on site p, and [formula] is the position of site p. Note that the subtraction of ρ in ([\ref=FourierTransform]) is meant to get rid of the lattice Bragg peaks. In order to study the ground state properties, we systematically use the inverse temperature β = 2L / t.

We start by illustrating in Fig. [\ref=ExactDiagonalization] the exactness of the SGF results, by comparing them with an exact diagonalization on a lattice with 2  ×  2 hexagons (12 sites) and six particles. The figure shows an excellent agreement for the energy E and the superfluid density ρs.

It is useful to analyze first the stability of the system. This is easily done by looking at the total density ρ as a function of the chemical potential μ. The slope of this function is proportional to the compressibility of the system, so an instability of the system results either in a negative slope in the CE, or a discontinuity of the total density in the GCE. We first discuss the small K region, and search for any phase transition as we increase the value of K. Figure [\ref=RhoVsMuK05] shows results for K = 5t and a system with [formula] hexagons (48 sites) in the CE and [formula] hexagons (432 sites) in the GCE. The agreement between the two curves reveals that finite size effects are sufficiently small to ensure the equivalence of the two ensembles. For this strength of the ring-exchange interactions the slope of the curve remains positive and finite at all fillings, so there is no instability.

The situation changes as K increases. Fig. [\ref=RhoVsMuK10K25] shows the total energy E as a function of the density ρ in the CE for K / t = 10 and K / t = 25. We show only data for [formula], since the data for [formula] can be deducted by particle-hole symmetry. The cyan dotted line serves as a guide to indicate that the curvature of the K / t = 10 curve is positive for [formula], while the orange dotted lines emphasize regions with negative curvatures. Systems for which the energy has a negative second derivative with respect to the density are thermodynamically unstable and undergo a phase separation. We also note the presence of a kink at [formula] for both curves, which indicates a gapped phase. We conclude that for K / t = 10 the system is compressible for [formula] and in a solid phase for [formula] and [formula], while it is unstable for all other densities. For K / t = 25 the system is unstable for all densities, except for [formula] and [formula] for which the phase is solid. The insets correspond to GCE results that are in agreement and which, in addition to showing "jumps" over the "forbidden" densities, show the existence of a "numerical hysteresis", depending on if the initial state is empty (ascendant hysteresis) or full (descendant hysteresis). This phenomenon is observed in many Monte Carlo studies [\cite=Beach] [\cite=Hebert], including the four-site ring-exchange model [\cite=Melko]. For these parameters the grand-canonical algorithm is no longer able to sample all contributing states, which is an indication that the system undergoes a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit. This also supports the importance of the ability of the SGF algorithm to work in the canonical ensemble.

Since only the fillings [formula] and [formula] are stable in the large K limit, it is convenient to analyze how the superfluid density ρs is destroyed as a function of K / t by working in the CE. We show in Fig. [\ref=RhosVsK] results for [formula] only, the case with [formula] being identical because of the particle-hole symmetry. There exists a critical value of the ring-exchange interaction, Kc  ≈  9t where the superfluid density vanishes. We show results for [formula] hexagons (108 sites) and [formula] hexagons (432 sites) to illustrate that finite size effects are small.

For t  ≫  K, the model is in the free hard-core limit, thus the superfluid phase prevails against solid or valence bond ordering. In the opposite t  ≪  K limit, we expect the ground state to be formed by configurations that maximize the number of resonating hexagons. Because a resonance can occur only if the hexagon contains exactly three non-first-neighboring particles, it is not possible to have two resonating neighboring hexagons at first order in K. This suggests that a phase with a maximum number of resonating hexagons can be formed at [formula] by having all resonating hexagons surrounded by empty hexagons (Fig. [\ref=VBS] left), or at [formula] by having all resonating hexagons surrounded by hexagons that contain three localized particles on the vertices of the triangles that are not shared with the resonating hexagons. (Fig. [\ref=VBS] right). These phases can be understood as a form of valence bond solid in which each valence bond now involves six sites, in contrast with the usual two-site singlets. We note that the phase has been suggested in Kagome lattice on other models, such as the transverse field Ising model [\cite=Nikolic-2005] [\cite=Blote].

This scenario is confirmed by looking at the structure factor. Figure [\ref=StructureFactor] shows [formula] for [formula] hexagons (972 sites) with [formula], K = 0, K = 5t, and K = 15t. For K = 0 (left panel), only lattice Bragg peaks arise and correspond to the minima of the intensity (black and blue). For K = 5t (middle panel), high intensity regions (red and yellow) appear in the center of triangles formed by the Bragg peaks. In the insulating phase, K = 15t (right panel), the high intensity regions become localized at [formula] in the [formula] basis (and symmetry related momenta), and form a honeycomb lattice. Since [formula] is parallel to [formula] and [formula], the insulating phase has features that appear with a spatial frequency of [formula] in the [formula] direction, in agreement with Fig. [\ref=VBS].

To conclude, we study hard-core bosons on a kagome lattice with a sextic ring-exchange term using the Stochastic Green Function algorithm [\cite=SGF] [\cite=DirectedUpdate] [\cite=GlobalSpaceTimeUpdate]. We find that the system becomes unstable towards phase separation as the ring-exchange interaction increases, except for densities [formula] and [formula] where the superfluid is destroyed. Here we observe an unusual valence bond solid phase with resonances involving six sites simultaneously. The hysteresis obtained in the quantum Monte Carlo indicates that the phase transition between the superfluid and the valence bond solid at [formula] and [formula] is first order. Models with higher order ring-exchange played an important role in the search of spin liquid phases due to their relation with the gauge theory deconfined phase. This work showcases the power of the Stochastic Green Function algorithm to study models with higher order ring-exchange interactions which have hitherto been very challenging for other Monte Carlo methods.
