The annihilation cross section of dark matter which is driven by scalar unparticle

Physics Department, Middle East Technical University Ankara, Turkey

The visible matter is considerably less than the amount of matter required in the universe and 23% of present Universe [\cite=JungmanG] [\cite=JungmanG2] [\cite=Clowe] [\cite=KomatsuE] [\cite=KomatsuE2] is contributed by the dark matter (DM) that is not detectable by the radiation emitted. Although the nature of DM is not known at present, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [\cite=JungmanG] are among the promising candidates of DM and they are expected in the mass range 10 GeV- a few TeV. WIMPs do not decay in to standard model (SM) particles since they are stable, however they disappear by pair annihilation (see for example [\cite=DEramoF] [\cite=WanLeiGuo]). One needs a theoretical framework beyond the SM in order to explain the nature of DM and its stability that can be ensured by an appropriate discrete symmetry in various models (for details see for example [\cite=ChuanRenChen] and references therein). From the experimental point of view the indirect detection of the DM candidate is based on the current relic density which can be explained by thermal freeze-out of their pair annihilation. By using the current DM abundance by the WMAP collaboration [\cite=KomatsuE2] one gets the appropriate range for the annihilation cross section and obtains a valuable information about the nature of DM. In the present work we take an additional scalar SM singlet DM field φS (see [\cite=SilveiraV]-[\cite=HeXG]) and assume that it interacts with the SM sector over the scalar unparticle propagator. Unparticles [\cite=Georgi1] [\cite=Georgi2] arise from the interaction of the SM and the ultraviolet sector with non-trivial infrared fixed point at high energy level. They are massless and they have non integral scaling dimension dU. The unparticle sector weakly interacts with the SM one and the interactions of unparticles with the SM fields in the low energy level is defined by the effective lagrangian

[formula]

with the unparticle operator OU, the energy scale ΛU, the space-time dimension n and the parameter η which carries information about the energy scale of ultraviolet sector, the low energy sector and the matching coefficient [\cite=Georgi1] [\cite=Georgi2] [\cite=Zwicky]. In order to formulate the DM annihilation we start with the effective lagrangian which obeys the Z2 symmetry φS  →    -  φS

[formula]

where λ0 is the effective coupling which leads to tree level DM-DM-scalar unparticle interaction. Here the DM scalar φS has no vacuum expectation value and the Z2 symmetry guarantees the stability of φS which appears as pairs and it can not decay into the SM particles. On the other hand they are expected to annihilate into SM particles with the annihilating cross section which obeys the observed DM abundance. The annihilation process is driven by the exchange particle(s) and, here, we assume that the scalar unparticle propagator is responsible for this annihilation. The scalar unparticle propagator is obtained by using the scale invariance [\cite=Georgi2] [\cite=Cheung1]:

where [formula] and the function [formula] becomes [formula] for p2 > 0 with a non-trivial phase which appears as a result of non-integral scaling dimension.

The total averaging annihilation rate of DM can obtained by the process φS  φS  →  U  →  XSM,

where [formula] with virtual unparticle Ũ having mass mU = 2  mS (see [\cite=BirdC] [\cite=BirdC2]) and [formula] is the average relative speed of two DM scalars (see for example [\cite=HeXG]). At this stage we present the functions Γ(Ũ  →  Xi  SM) which appear in the annihilation cross section arising from possible annihilations that are valid for the DM mass range we choose (see Discussion section): In this range the annihilations to the fermion-antifermion pairs, photon pair, gluon pair and WW*, ZZ* can exist. For the fermion-antifermion output we have

where Nf = 1  (3) for leptons (quarks) and [formula]. The one for the photon-photon (gluon-gluon) pair reads

[formula]

where [formula] and β = 1  (2) for V = γ  (g). Finally for WW* and ZZ* output we get

where pi  (pj,  p3) is the outgoing charged lepton or down quark (incoming neutrino or up quark, outgoing W boson) four momentum for Γij(Ũ  →  WW*), the outgoing lepton or quark (antilepton or antiquark, outgoing Z boson) four momentum for Γij(Ũ  →  ZZ*). In eq.([\ref=DWij]) |MWij|2 reads

Here [formula], Vij is the CKM matrix element for up-down quark pairs and Vij = 1 for neutrino-charged lepton. Finally |MZij|2 is

Now we are ready to analyze annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   and, by using the expression for the relic abundance,

[formula]

with xf  ~  25 [\cite=HeXG], [\cite=ServantG]-[\cite=Gopalakrishna2], we get the range [formula]. Here we respect the upper and the lower bounds of the present relic abundance [\cite=KomatsuE2]

Discussion In the present work we analyze the annihilation cross section of DM which interacts with the SM sector over the scalar unparticle propagator. The DM-DM-unparticle coupling λ0 plays an important role in the annihilation process and we study its numerical value by respecting the estimated upper and lower bounds of the annihilation cross section of the DM, namely, 2.21  ×  10- 9  GeV- 2  ≤        <  σ  vr  >          ≤  2.44  ×  10- 9  GeV- 2. Furthermore, the scaling dimension of scalar unparticle, the energy scale ΛU and the DM mass mS are among the free parameters of this scenario. For the the scaling dimension dU we choose the well known range 1 < du < 2 (see [\cite=Georgi2] [\cite=Liao1]). We consider the DM mass mS in the interval 10  GeV  ≤  mS  ≤  70  GeV and we take the the energy scale ΛU = 10  TeV.

In Fig.[\ref=sigmS] we plot the DM mass mS dependence of the coupling λ0 for the annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   and different values of dU. Here the lower-intermediate-upper solid (long dashed; dashed) line represents λ0 for dU = 1.1 - 1.3 - 1.5 and <  σ  vr  >  AV (<  σ  vr  >  Max; <  σ  vr  >  Min). We observe that the coupling λ0 is sensitive to mS and this sensitivity increases with the increasing values of the scaling dimension dU. For small values of dU and mS λ0 is more restricted and their increasing values result in that λ0 lies in a broader range. In order to get the present experimental result of <  σ  vr  >  , λ0 must be at the order of the magnitude of 0.01 for 1.1 < du  <  1.3 and it must reach to 0.1 for dU = 1.5 for the DM mass values mS > 40  GeV. For completeness we present the scaling dimension dU dependence of the coupling λ0 for the annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   and different values of mS in Fig.[\ref=sigdu]. Here the lower-intermediate-upper solid (long dashed; dashed) line represents λ0 for mS = 30 - 50 - 70  GeV and <  σ  vr  >  AV (<  σ  vr  >  Max; <  σ  vr  >  Min). This figure also show the strong sensitivity of the coupling λ0 to the scaling dimension dU. The coupling reaches to the numerical values of the order of 1.0 for the upper bounds of dU, namely for dU  ~  1.9.

Figs.[\ref=crosslam01mS] and [\ref=crosslam01du] represent mS and dU dependence of the annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   and, in both figures, the straight solid lines show the estimated upper and lower bounds.

Fig.[\ref=crosslam01mS] is devoted to the annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   with respect to mS for different values of dU and λ0. Here the solid (long dashed; dashed) line represents <  σ  vr  >   for dU = 1.1 and λ0 = 0.01 (dU = 1.2 and λ0 = 0.01; dU = 1.5 and λ0 = 0.1). We observe that the <  σ  vr  >   is obtained in the estimated range for dU = 1.1 and λ0 = 0.01 in the case of mS  ~  60  GeV. For dU = 1.2 and λ0 = 0.01 the DM mass should be light, namely mS  ~  25  GeV, to get <  σ  vr  >   in the estimated range. For dU = 1.5 and λ0 = 0.1, <  σ  vr  >   lies in the estimated range for mS  ~  40  GeV. We see that, for a fixed coupling λ0 (for λ0 = 0.01 see this figure), the increase in the scaling dimension dU results in the decrease in the mass mS so that <  σ  vr  >   lies in the estimated range.

Fig.[\ref=crosslam01du] represents the annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   with respect to dU for λ0 = 0.1 and different values of mS. Here the solid (long dashed; dashed; dotted; dot-dashed) line represents <  σ  vr  >   for mS = 30  (40;50;60;70)  GeV. This figure shows that <  σ  vr  >   lies in the estimated range when mS respects 30  GeV  <  mS  <  70  GeV and dU  ~  1.5.

As a summary, the annihilation cross section <  σ  vr  >   is sensitive to the DM-DM-unparticle coupling λ0, the DM mass mS and the scaling dimension dU. We observe that the coupling λ0 is strongly restricted for the small values of dU and mS. The experimental result of <  σ  vr  >   is obtained if λ0 is at the order of the magnitude of 0.01 (0.1) for 1.1 < du  <  1.3 (dU  ~  1.5) in the case of mS > 40  GeV. For dU  ~  1.9, λ0 reaches to the numerical values of the order of 1.0.

With the forthcoming more accurate experimental measurements one will provide a considerable information about the mechanism driving the possible annihilation process of DM and the role of unparticle physics on this process.
