Introduction

Magnetic fields in white dwarfs show great diversity in strength and structure. Field strengths from a few kilogauss [\citep=fab2000] [\citep=azn2004] to nearly 109 G [\citep=bar1995] [\citep=fer1997] delineate the current range of detection, although higher and lower fields cannot, in principle, be ruled out. Low-dispersion spectropolarimetric surveys successfully achieved detection limits below a kilogauss [\citep=azn2004] or of the order of a few kG [\citep=sch1994] [\citep=kaw2007], while echelle spectroscopy achieved limits of several kilogauss with Zeeman splitting measurements in line cores [\citep=koe1998]. The spectra of high-field white dwarfs are very complex and detailed modelling requires application of model atoms in high-fields [\citep=mar1984] [\citep=jor1992]. Hydrogen and helium atomic data are available for such studies [\citep=kem1974] [\citep=gar1974].

Stellar rotation, by exposing a variable line-of-sight projection of the field vector, often reveals a more complex field structure than a simple dipole [\citep=mar1984] as found in the cases of the fast-rotating ([formula] min) white dwarf J0317-  855 [\citep=bur1999] [\citep=ven2003x] or the "spotted" magnetic white dwarf WD 1953-  011 with a rotation period of 1.4 day [\citep=max2000] [\citep=bri2005] [\citep=val2008]. Apart from the common hypothesis of a fossil origin, magnetic fields may be generated in later stages as first proposed by [\citet=tou2008], first, during a common-envelope (CE) phase of binary evolution [\citep=pot2010] [\citep=nor2011] or in a double degenerate merger [\citep=gar2012].

[\citet=kaw2004x] examined the distribution of field strength in the Ap star population and concluded that a direct link between Ap stars and high field magnetic white dwarfs ([formula] G) may exist assuming magnetic flux conservation, but that low-field white dwarfs are without known progenitors. However, [\citet=wic2005] found a progenitor deficit for high-field white dwarfs and postulated that a large fraction of massive main-sequence stars ([formula]) may harbour weak fields (10-100 G).

We present a survey of 58 high proper-motion white dwarfs conducted with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS) at the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The observations, presented in Section 2, provided us with intensity and circular polarization spectra enabling high-sensitivity measurements of the surface-averaged (BS) and longitudinal (Bl) magnetic fields (Section 3). In particular, we examine the sample properties (Section 3.1), our new low-field detections (Section 3.2) and instances of variable high-fields (Section 3.3), and the sample kinematical properties (Section 3.4) as well as other interesting aspects of this survey (Section 3.5). We summarize and discuss some implications of our results in Section 4.

Observations

We obtained two sets of observations using the FORS spectrograph attached to the 8m telescopes at Paranal Observatory. The first data set was obtained with the FORS1 attached to UT2. We used the 600 lines per mm grism centred at 4650 Å (Grism 600B). The slit width was set to 1.0 arcsec to obtain a spectral dispersion of 1.51Å per pixel and a resolution of ~  6Å. The second set of observations was obtained with the FORS2 attached to UT1. For these observations we used the 1200 lines per mm grism centred at 6500 Å (Grism 1200R+93) providing a spectral dispersion of 0.73 Å per pixel. The slit width was set to 1.0 arcsec to obtain a spectral resolution of 3.0 Å. Both sets of spectra were obtained in the spectropolarimetric mode where the observing sequence consisted of an exposure with the Wollaston prism rotated to [formula] immediately followed by an exposure with the Wollaston prism rotated to [formula].

Additional spectra of the programme stars were obtained at ESO using the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). We also collected spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8, and recycled our published spectra [\citep=kaw2006]. The complete data set will be described in a forthcoming publication and, here, we employ key results of the spectroscopic analysis of these complementary spectra. In summary, the spectra obtained with the NTT have a resolution of ~  14 Å and a spectral range of 3700 - 7400 Å, the spectra obtained with the CTIO 4m telescope have a resolution of ~  8 Å with a spectral range of 3700 - 7480 Å, and the spectra obtained with the KPNO 4m telescope have a resolution of ~  5.5 Å and a spectral range of 3660 - 6790 Å. The SDSS spectra cover a range from 3800 to 9200 Å and have a resolution of ~  3 Å.

The data were reduced using standard IRAF procedures. The stars observed during P80 (FORS1) were flux calibrated using the standard stars Feige 110, EG 21 and EG 274.

Table [\ref=tbl_obs] lists the selected targets. Figure [\ref=fig_DA] shows the intensity spectra obtained during the two FORS programmes. Some of the blue spectra showed heavy element lines (Ca H&K) characteristic of polluted DA white dwarfs (DAZ), while the red spectra only showed Hα with the exception of the spectrum of NLTT 11748: the strong, saturated Na D doublet ([formula]mÅ, [formula]mÅ) at a heliocentric velocity of [formula] km s- 1 revealed a high neutral gas (Na i) column density in the interstellar medium (ISM) toward the star. The Na D doublet was not detected toward any other objects from our sample. The star NLTT 11748 is located toward a known high-density line-of-sight [\citep=ver2001] [\citep=wel2010] and the scaled ISM H i column density (1021 cm- 2) correlates well with the relatively large extinction coefficient EB - V = 0.1 measured by [\citet=kaw2009].

Observations of the DC white dwarfs NLTT 8525, NLTT 8904, NLTT 11051, NLTT 20389, and PM J04356-  6105, of the DZ white dwarfs NLTT 57760 and PM J08186-  3110, and of the DQ white dwarfs NLTT 8733 and NLTT 14553 will be presented in a forthcoming publication. Two targets that were subsequently reclassified are not listed: NLTT 18393 (M3.5) and NLTT 40020 (G5V). Finally, we also excluded one observation of NLTT 17486 obtained on UT 2007 October 31 and all observations of NLTT 40636 because of pointing errors. The coordinates and proper-motion measurements are from [\citet=sal2003].

The circular polarization spectra were obtained using two successive exposures obtained with the Wollaston prism rotated to the angle [formula] and [formula] and were calculated following:

[formula]

where fo and fe are the fluxes from the ordinary and extra-ordinary beams, respectively. The direction of polarization of these beams are perpendicular to each other. This method is used to eliminate possible biases to first order [\citep=bag2002].

Imaging and photometry

We calibrated the acquisition images and converted the count rates into broad-band magnitudes. The procedure is described in Appendix A and the magnitudes are listed in Table [\ref=tbl_mag] along with published V magnitudes and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) J magnitudes. A close examination of the acquisition images of NLTT 17662 revealed the the presence of a close (sep.≈  1.6 arcsecond, [formula]) companion to the white dwarf approximately 1 mag fainter. A comparison with the first-epoch Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) image proves that the faint companion is in common proper-motion with the bright star. Fortunately, both stars were acquired during the spectroscopic observations and we were able to analyse both FORS spectra. Similarly, our acquisition image of NLTT 56045 also reveal the presence of a close common proper-motion companion 1.1 mag fainter in white light (sep.≈  2.2 arcsecond, [formula]). The faint component was also acquired during spectroscopic observations but no spectra were extracted.

Finally, we cross-correlated our sample of stars with the SDSS Data Release 8 and obtained ugriz photometry for 18 objects. Only one of these had a SDSS spectrum. Table [\ref=tbl_sdss] lists the available ugriz photometry. A correction of - 0.04 mag was applied to the tabulated u magnitude prior to our analysis [\citep=kle2004].

Analysis

The hydrogen-rich white dwarfs were analysed for their effective temperature and surface gravity using a grid of pure-hydrogen LTE plane-parallel models. The grid of models extends from Teff   = 4900 K to 8000 K (in steps of 100 K), from 8200 to 10000 K (in steps of 200 K) and from 10500 to 20000 K (in steps of 500 K) at log g  =  5.5 to 9.5 (in steps of 0.25 dex). The models are described in [\citet=kaw2006] and [\citet=kaw2007] with some upgrades described in [\citet=kaw2012]. The observed Balmer line profiles were fitted with model spectra using χ2 minimization techniques. The quoted uncertainties are only statistical (1σ) and do not take into account possible systematic effects in model calculations, data acquisition or reduction procedures.

We used the evolutionary mass-radius relations of [\citet=ben1999] to convert the measured effective temperature and surface gravity measurements into white dwarf ages and masses. For hydrogen-rich white dwarfs we used the models with MH / M*  =  10- 4 and a metallicity of Z=0. For helium rich white dwarfs, we used the models of [\citet=ben1999] without a hydrogen envelope. The evolutionary tracks of [\citet=ser2002] were employed to interpret the parameters of the extremely low-mass white dwarf NLTT 11748.

The longitudinal magnetic field was determined by first fitting the Balmer line profiles with a model profile. We then used this best-fitting model profile to calculate the V / I spectra at various magnetic field strengths (Bl in Gauss):

[formula]

in first order, where λ is the wavelength in Å and F is the spectral flux. This grid of synthetic circular polarization spectra are then fitted to the observed circular polarization spectra using χ2 minimization techniques.

The procedure applied to our flux calibration standards EG 21 (WD 0310-  688) and EG 274 (WD 1620-  391) provided field measurements of [formula] and [formula] kG, respectively, using the Hβ, γ, and δ lines. The errors are comparable to other measurements from this programme owing to the relatively short exposure times employed when observing standards. The present results confirm the null results obtained by [\cite=kaw2007] who measured [formula] (EG 21) and [formula] kG (EG 274) using the Hα, β, and γ lines.

Sample properties

Teff and log g measurements

Table [\ref=tbl_atm] lists the measured atmospheric parameters of the sample stars. Using Balmer lines alone, the errors in surface gravity measurements increase considerably at low temperatures Teff [formula] K. Figure [\ref=fig_tg] (left panels) shows the gravity versus temperature measurements based on fitting of the Balmer lines. The data set, which excludes the high-field DAP white dwarfs NLTT 12758 and 13015, comprises 83 individual measurements obtained using different instruments described in Section 2. The surface gravity distribution, excluding NLTT 11748, is consistent with a sample average <   log g >  = 7.92 and an intrinsic width σ = 0.36 dex (χ2 = 1) corresponding to an average mass of [formula]. The average mass is lower than determined for younger white dwarf samples such as the SDSS white dwarf sample for which mean masses of [formula] [\citep=kep2007] and [formula] [\citep=tre2011] were determined. [\citet=gia2011] determined a mean mass of [formula] from their spectroscopic analysis of white dwarfs selected from the McCook & Sion catalogue [\citep=mcc1999]. Recently, [\citet=gia2012] reanalysed the local sample of white dwarfs and determined a mean mass of [formula].

Figure [\ref=fig_umg_gmr] shows photometric data of a sub-sample of 18 of these objects and synthetic colours computed using our model atmosphere grid. The observed colours clearly show the effect of extended Lyα absorption described by [\citet=kow2006].

Several measurements based on Balmer lines, particularly those excluding Hα, are unsatisfactory below ~  6500 K. In such cases where the error on the surface gravity exceeded 0.5 dex, we adopted the average and dispersion of gravity measurements for stars with temperatures above ~  6500 K, i.e,, <   log g >  = 8.0 and σg = 0.24, and we fitted the Balmer lines within this constraint to determine the temperature. Next, we compared the adopted effective temperatures to measurements based on SDSS ugriz photometry and on the V - J and R - J indices: Figure  [\ref=fig_tg] (right panel) show the measurements obtained using the various methods. The results based on Balmer lines and the V - J index differ by 16 K only with a dispersion of 412 K. Those based on the R - J index differ from the Balmer line results by 72 K with a dispersion of 552 K. The temperatures measured using the SDSS ugriz data differ by - 117 K on average but with a lower dispersion of 189 K. The latter also suggest that the effective temperature of cool white dwarfs ([formula] K) obtained by fitting Balmer lines assuming log g = 8 may be overestimated by a few 100 K.

Table [\ref=tbl_atm] also lists the absolute magnitude, age, mass, and distance estimates. The distances were obtained by calculating the distance modulus m - M from the absolute and apparent magnitudes (Appendix A). The DA white dwarfs NLTT 3080, NLTT 13532, NLTT 56805, and PM J11480-  4523 probably reside within 25 pc from the Sun.

Magnetic field measurements

Probable or definite non-zero field measurements are reported in Table [\ref=tbl_mag_meas] where bold-faced entries are weighted averages, and Table [\ref=tbl_nonmag_meas] lists average field measurements that are statistically consistent with the null hypothesis. The uncertainties vary and are lower when measuring strong, narrow lines. For example, the error obtained in measuring the Ca H&K lines in NLTT 7547 is a factor of four lower than obtained in measuring the shallow Balmer lines.

Figure [\ref=fig_stat_error] shows the error distributions obtained using the Hα or the upper-Balmer set-ups. The sample depicted in the diagram excludes the strong-field objects NLTT 12758 and NLTT 13015. The errors are typically of the order of 2-3 kG when measuring Hα, and the errors increase to 5-10 kG when measuring the upper Balmer lines. The field distribution obtained using the upper Balmer lines also shows a systematic offset of 4 kG. The significance of the measurements, B / σB, closely follows a normalized Gaussian distribution when measuring Hα, but the distribution obtained when measuring the less significant upper Balmer lines departs somewhat from expectations indicating that the errors were overestimated by [formula]%. Two outliers stood out, NLTT 2219 in the upper-Balmer distribution and NLTT 347 in the Hα distribution.

New low-field magnetic white dwarfs

NLTT 347 is most likely a new weak-field magnetic white dwarf. We measured a longitudinal field of [formula] kG field in the co-added spectrum, which is a 2.4σ detection. Figure [\ref=fig_nltt347_2219] (left) shows the combined flux and circular polarization spectra of Hα compared to the best fit models. For individual measurements we obtained a similar field-strength although at a lower significance.

NLTT 2219 is a cool magnetic white dwarf. Figure [\ref=fig_nltt347_2219] (right) shows the flux and polarization spectra. The flux spectrum shows a rounded core due to the weak magnetic field, and the circular polarization spectrum clearly shows the effect of a weak magnetic field.

We reported previously on NLTT 10480 as a new magnetic ([formula] kG) DAZ white dwarf [\citep=kaw2011]. The polarization and flux spectra of Ca H&K constrained [formula] kG [\citep=kaw2012] suggesting a field inclination of [formula]. This object is one of the coolest white dwarfs showing heavy element lines.

New, variable, high-field white dwarfs

NLTT 12758 is a new magnetic white dwarf (Fig. [\ref=fig_nltt12758_13015]). We estimated a temperature of [formula] K using the V - J index assuming a gravity log g = 8. The Zeeman splitting corresponds to a surface magnetic field of [formula] MG. Available photometry (V  =  15.46, U - B  =   - 0.71, B - V  =   + 0.31) from [\citet=egg1968] suggests an effective temperature of ≈  7700 K, which is in agreement with our determination. The structure of the Hα profile of NLTT 12758 appears to be similar to that of the magnetic white dwarf NLTT 48454 (WD 1953-  011). [\citet=max2000] found that the magnetic field strength of NLTT 48454 varied as shown by variable Zeeman line splitting in the Hα core. They proposed a two-component model for the magnetic field structure of the white dwarf, whereby the star has a weak dipolar magnetic field of ~  70 kG with a much stronger spot-like field of ~  500 kG. Moreover, as in the case of NLTT 48454, the π component is too strong for the σ components suggesting the simultaneous presence of high- and low- field structures, or that NLTT 12758 is in fact a double degenerate star. Variations in the radial velocity measured using the π component also suggest the presence of a close companion (see Section 3.4). A few resolved magnetic plus non-magnetic double degenerates are known [\citep=gir2010] [\citep=dob2012], while some are, to date, unresolved [\citep=ven1999] [\citep=sch2003]. NLTT 12758 may be the first known close double degenerate with a magnetic component.

NLTT 13015 is also a new magnetic DA white dwarf (Fig. [\ref=fig_nltt12758_13015]) with a temperature of [formula] (assuming log g = 8) determined using the V - J and R - J indices. We measured a spread in surface magnetic field strength ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 MG. The field is possibly time variable and quadratic Zeeman effects are apparent in π and σ components.

Radial velocities and kinematics

The Hα intensity spectra were well suited for a survey of radial velocity (vr) variability, and all FORS spectra were used in a detailed kinematical study of this sample of high proper-motion white dwarfs. We measured vr by fitting a Gaussian function to the narrow Hα or Hβ line cores, or, when available, the Ca H&K lines. The errors were estimated by varying the flux continuum placement. The average and dispersion of the Hα velocity measurements are  = 59.3 and σv = 35.3 km s- 1, while for the Hβ/Ca H&K lines they are  = 50.1 and σv = 43.6 km s- 1. Individual Hα velocity measurements are listed in Appendix B. Radial velocities for NLTT 11748 are listed in [\citet=kaw2010].

We tested the null hypothesis, i.e., a constant velocity, by plotting the distribution of velocity measurements relative to the mean for each star, (vi  -  ) / σv, where [formula] is the weighted average of the individual measurements vi. The distribution is then compared to a normalized Gaussian function and outliers are identified. First, we noted that the distribution was too broad and that systematic errors, i.e., instrumental artefacts, probably dominated statistical errors when measuring Hα velocities and to a lesser extent when measuring the less-accurate upper Balmer lines. Therefore, we added a 5 km s- 1 systematic error in quadrature, σ2v  +  (5  km  s- 1)2, and recovered a normal distribution. Similarly, a normal distribution is recovered for the Hβ/Ca H&K measurements by adding 10 km s- 1 in quadrature. Apart from the close double degenerate NLTT 11748 [\citep=kaw2010] and the peculiar DAP NLTT 12758 mentioned above (Section 3.3), two other objects stood out (χ2  >  3) in this survey as possible close binaries, NLTT 6559 and NLTT 31473. However, many sequences cover only a short time interval ([formula] hr) and other likely candidates may emerge (e.g., NLTT 21813, see below).

A comparison with published velocity measurements demonstrates the reliability of the Hα velocity scale. [\citet=zuc2003] listed a velocity of 27.9 km s- 1 for NLTT 3080 close to our own measurement of 28.6 km s- 1. The standard deviation of the six measurements (5.1 km s- 1), is larger than individual errors (~  1 km s- 1), and is probably typical of the limited stability of the FORS velocity scale. [\citet=sal2004] measured a radial velocity [formula] km s- 1  for the candidate halo star NLTT 9940 in agreement with our velocity of [formula] km s- 1 (standard deviation 7.6 km s- 1). [\citet=max1999] measured a radial velocity [formula] km s- 1 for NLTT 33503 with a low probability of being variable. We measured [formula] km s- 1 (measurement and systematic errors added as above) revealing only a small systematic difference. Finally, [\cite=kaw2012] measured the radial velocity of NLTT 23966 with the X-shooter spectrograph and obtained [formula] km s- 1 in agreement with the present FORS measurement of [formula] km s- 1 (standard deviation 7.1 km s- 1). On average, our measurements differ by only ~  4 km s- 1 from published measurements. The differences are comparable to systematic errors of ~  5 km s- 1.

Similarly, [\citet=sal2004] measured [formula] km s- 1 for NLTT 5543 while we measured [formula] km s- 1 using the Hβ line showing similar accuracy.

Figure [\ref=fig_kinematics] shows the kinematical properties of our sample in the U versus V Galactic velocity components. We calculated the velocities following [\citet=joh1987]. The effect of the gravitational redshift was removed from the radial velocity measurements. The UVW velocity distributions excluding five peculiar objects (see Fig. [\ref=fig_kinematics]) follow expected averages and standard deviations of an old population: (Ū,,) = ( - 7.8, - 40.1, - 5.9) km s- 1, and (σU,σV,σW) = (42.8,31.9,27.4) km s- 1. The average V velocity of the present sample is characteristic of the lag-velocity of thick-disc white dwarfs [\citep=pau2006], but it is larger than estimated by [\citet=chi2000] for thick-disc stars. On the other hand, the velocity dispersions are intermediate to those of thin- and thick-disc white dwarfs [\citep=pau2006]. The present NLTT sample is possibly a mix of old thin- and thick-disc populations. Three objects clearly belong to the halo: NLTT 11748, NLTT 31473, and NLTT 33503. NLTT 33503 is a newly identified, young halo white dwarf (τcool  =  170 Myr). We calculated a mass of [formula] and, following the low-metallicity (Z = 0.0004) evolutionary models of [\citet=gir2000], the likely progenitor is a low-mass star ([formula]) with a total lifespan of 11 Gyr. NLTT 31473 is an older halo white dwarf (τcool  =  2.9 Myr) with a more massive progenitor with a lifespan of 8 Gyr ([formula]). Two other objects show extreme kinematical properties: the high-field magnetic white dwarf NLTT 13015 and the visual double-degenerate NLTT 17486. Both objects are beyond the 2σ locus of the thick-disc but they are clearly not associated to the halo.

Comments on selected objects

Overlap with other catalogues or surveys

Our selection is based primarily on the catalogue of [\citet=sal2003] but some of the targets may also be found in the Liverpool-Edinburgh high proper-motion survey [\citep=pok2003]. Most objects may be found in Luyten's White Dwarf Catalogues [\citep=luy1970] [\citep=luy1977]; these objects were considered probable white dwarfs based on their reduced proper-motion but, in most cases, they were awaiting spectroscopic confirmation. Only ten objects were not listed in Luyten's White Dwarf Catalogues.

A few objects from our sample have been studied previously. [\citet=koe2009] obtained VLT/UVES spectra of NLTT 3080 and measured (Teff, [formula]. However, by combining V = 15.26 from [\citet=egg1965a] and the 2MASS J, i.e., [formula], we obtain a temperature of [formula] K in agreement with our spectroscopic determinations (Table [\ref=tbl_atm]).

[\citet=lam2000] listed NLTT 5814 as a DA3.5 white dwarf (MCT 0142-  3026).

[\citet=lim2010] measured (Teff,[formula] for NLTT 6559 (KUV01552-  0703). We obtained a significantly lower surface gravity measurement.

[\citet=sub2008] listed NLTT 13532 as a DC white dwarf. However, assuming a hydrogen-rich composition they estimated [formula] based on optical VRI and 2MASS photometric measurements. We classified NLTT 13532 as a DA white dwarf based on the detection of Hα in FORS spectra.

[\citet=rei2005] classified the object NLTT 14558 as a DC white dwarf, although a weak Hα line is apparent in their spectrum. Based on a photometric temperature estimate, [\citet=kaw2004] estimated a relatively high tangential velocity. We classified NLTT 14558 as a DA white dwarf based on the detection of Hβ in FORS spectra. The Galactic velocity vectors of NLTT 14558 are typical of the present sample.

[\citet=hin1974] classified NLTT 15957 as a DA "weak" owing to the weak Balmer lines.

[\citet=rei2005] classified NLTT 17486 as a DA7 white dwarf. Based on photometric measurements, [\citet=sub2008] estimated an effective temperature of [formula] K. Also, [\citet=kaw2004] estimated a high tangential velocity, and, as noted above (Section 3.4), this object has peculiar kinematics.

NLTT 28493 was classified as a cool DA white dwarf by [\citet=kil2006]. They estimated an effective temperature of Teff    =  6516 K using SDSS photometry. [\citet=car2006] also showed this star to be a cool DA white dwarf.

For NLTT 33503, [\citet=koe2009] measured [formula].

[\citet=sub2007] classified NLTT 33669 as a DA white dwarf and estimated [formula] based on photometry.

[\citet=gre1984] classified NLTT 51252 as a DA white dwarf.

NLTT 56805 was classified as a cool DA white dwarf by [\citet=ven2003]. They estimated an effective temperature of [formula] K, and showed that it has a low surface gravity (log g  ≈  7). Our new spectrum along with the SDSS ugriz photometry confirm the low temperature. The recent trigonometric parallax measurement of [formula] mas (or [formula] pc) from [\citet=lep2009] confirms the low surface gravity of the object: assuming Teff  =  5000 K and an absolute magnitude of [formula], we obtain a low surface gravity of [formula].

PM J11480-  4523 was selected from the sample of high proper-motion stars of [\citet=lep2005].

DAZ white dwarfs

Six objects are classified as DAZ white dwarfs. [\citet=kaw2011] [\citet=kaw2012] already discussed the cases of NLTT 6390, 10480, and 11393. Briefly, they measured calcium abundances ranging from log Ca  /  H  ≈   - 10.0 to - 10.5, and, as mentioned above, measured an averaged surface field of [formula] kG in NLTT 10480. The spectrum of NLTT 6390 also showed iron and magnesium lines. Our survey uncovered two new DAZ white dwarfs, NLTT 888 and 7547, and new spectra of NLTT 25792 helped reclassify this object as a DAZ white dwarf. [\citet=kil1997] had originally classified NLTT 25792 (EC 10542-  2236) as a sdB+, that is a hot sdB star which shows the Ca K line. [\citet=kaw2011x] and [\citet=gia2011] independently identified the star as a cool DAZ white dwarf. [\citet=gia2011] also measured a calcium abundance log Ca  /  H =  - 8.3 at Teff   = 7910 K. Their abundance is somewhat lower than estimated in the present work, and both measurements are lower than estimated by [\citet=kaw2011x] because of their higher temperature estimate. Our new measurement of the calcium abundance and effective temperature, [formula] and Teff   = 7921, as well as the measurements of [\citet=gia2011] place NLTT 25792 above the observed calcium abundance trend [\citep=kaw2011x].

The calcium abundances in the atmospheres of NLTT 888 and 7547 are [formula] and [formula], respectively.

Double degenerates and common proper-motion binaries

Several objects are paired with main-sequence or degenerate companions.

The white dwarf NLTT 4615 is in a common proper-motion binary with the dM star NLTT 4616 [\citep=sil2001]. They estimated for the white dwarf Teff   = 6037 K based on the V - I index. [\citet=sch2012] list NLTT 4615 as a "former" Hyades DC white dwarf. [\citet=gar2011] correctly identified it as a DA white dwarf and measured Teff   = 5950 K based on VJHK colours, or ~  170 K hotter than our spectroscopic measurement.

[\citet=sil2001] listed NLTT 7051 as a DA white dwarf and estimated Teff   = 5709 K. The white dwarf is in a common proper-motion binary with the dM3 star NLTT 7055.

[\citet=gia2011] independently identified NLTT 21913 as an unresolved DA+DC pair. They found that the binary is composed of a massive DA component with (Teff,   log g)  =  (10000  K,  8.91) and a cool DC white dwarf with (Teff,   log g)  =  (5600  K,  8.00). The average of two radial velocity measurements obtained with FORS ([formula] km s- 1) differs significantly from the velocity measured by [\citet=zuc2003] with the Keck HIRES, vr = 130.2 km s- 1, from which we conclude that NLTT 21913 is a close DA+DC binary. Additional velocity measurements should help constrain the period and DC mass function. We fitted the observed Balmer lines with two sets of model spectra using χ2 minimization techniques. In each fitting procedure, we varied Teff and log g for the H-rich white dwarf and only the Teff for the He-rich white dwarf at a given mass. We calculated a set of He-rich spectra at different masses (0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 [formula]) and the fitting procedure was repeated for each given mass. We took note of the best χ2 for each fit and calculated the best mass and temperature for the DC with the corresponding Teff and log g for the DA white dwarf. Figure [\ref=fig_21913] (left panel) shows the best fitting model spectra (DA: [formula], DC: [formula]) compared to the observed Balmer lines of NLTT 21913. Similarly, we fitted the spectral energy distribution of NLTT 21913 using the two sets of model spectra. First, we calculated synthetic magnitudes (GALEX FUV, NUV, UBV, and 2MASS JHK) using our spectra. We then fitted the measured magnitudes GALEX NUV, UBV and 2MASS J magnitudes with the synthetic magnitudes assuming a mass of [formula] for the DC white dwarf and varying both effective temperatures and the surface gravity of the DA white dwarf. Figure [\ref=fig_21913] (right panel) shows the measured magnitudes of NLTT 21913 compared to the best fitting combined spectrum and the DA and DC component spectra. Both methods uncovered a massive DA component.

[\citet=egg1965b] classified NLTT 17662 (EGGR 171) as a DA white dwarf. As discussed earlier (Section 2) we uncovered in the FORS acquisition image a close companion to this object. Both stars were acquired during spectroscopic observations with the bright component (A) centred on the slit and the fainter component (B) off-centre. We measured Teff and log g of component A using the EFOSC spectrum obtained as part of the P82 programme; component B was left out of the slit. Next, we calculated the absolute R magnitude (MR) of component A, and, using apparent magnitudes (Table [\ref=tbl_mag]) we calculated [formula] mag for component B. Finally, we fitted the Hα line profile in the Teff and log g plane and constrained the range of solutions using the calculated MR. The resulting parameters are listed in Table [\ref=tbl_atm]. The surface gravity or mass measurements are strongly correlated because of the requirement of a constant flux ratio. Component A is hotter and younger than component B. Using the evolutionary models of [\citet=sch1992] at Z = 0.019 and keeping the total age within 10 Gyr, the cooling age differential (Δτage  ≈  1.4 - 2.3 Gyr) implies an initial mass range [formula] for component A while the cooling age of component B limits the initial mass to [formula]. Incidentally, the surface gravity measurements suggest that the white dwarf NLTT 17662B is only [formula] more massive than its companion NLTT 17662A, in agreement with the small gravitational redshift offset between the two stars (γB  -  γA  ≈  6 km s- 1). Applying additional constraints stemming from the initial-to-final mass relations of [\citet=kal2008], the final mass differential implies an initial mass differential of [formula]. Hence, the initial, correlated mass ranges are [formula] and [formula]. Further spectroscopic observations, such as a complete Balmer line spectrum of component B, should help refine these estimates.

The white dwarf NLTT 29967 is in a common proper-motion binary with the K-type dwarf HIP 59519 [\citep=gou2004]. The Hipparcos parallax, [formula] mas, corresponds to a distance of d  =  45.1+ 3.2- 2.8 pc [\citep=van2007] in agreement with our distance estimate of [formula] pc that was obtained using the calculated distance modulus m - M. Conversely, by constraining the distance to 45.1+ 3.2- 2.8 pc and applying the mass-radius relation we constrain the surface gravity to log g  =  7.92+ 0.14- 0.17 and the mass to [formula]. [\citet=gar2011] measured [formula] using Balmer line profiles, but [formula] using photometric measurements alone. Our spectroscopic results confirm the higher temperature estimate.

Halo white dwarfs

Our kinematical study offered clues to the origin (total age) of some of the objects.

[\citet=opp2001] listed NLTT 5543 as a candidate halo white dwarf and their spectroscopy revealed the presence of the Hα line (DA class). [\citet=ber2005] estimated an effective temperature of [formula] K using optical and infrared photometry. We measured [formula] by fitting the Balmer lines with the surface gravity set to [formula]. The effective temperature corresponding to the colour index [formula] is Teff    =  6640+ 390- 340 K. The DA NLTT 9940 is the second halo white dwarf candidate proposed by [\citet=opp2001] that is covered in our sample. [\citet=ber2005] estimated [formula] K based on photometry alone. We measured [formula] by fitting the Balmer lines, and again setting the surface gravity at [formula]. The temperature obtained by fitting the SDSS ugriz colours is [formula] K in agreement with the spectroscopic temperature. Both optical-infrared indices (V - J and R - J) indicate a lower temperature of 5000 K possibly revealing an error in the 2MASS J band measurement: [\citet=kil2010] measured J = 16.20 and the optical-infrared index V - J = 1.13 corresponds to a temperature of ≈  5800 K in agreement with optical temperatures. We confirm that neither object, NLTT 5543 or NLTT 9940, is a genuine halo white dwarf but, instead, they are likely members of the thick-disc [\citep=sal2004].

We originally presented evidence of the peculiar Galactic velocity components of NLTT 11748 [\citep=kaw2009] [\citep=kaw2010]. Its halo membership also allowed [\citet=kaw2009] to constrain the mass of the progenitor ([formula]). The DA white dwarfs NLTT 31473 and NLTT 33503 are two new candidates for the halo membership based on their Galactic velocity components (Fig. [\ref=fig_kinematics]).

Summary and Discussion

We have conducted a spectropolarimetric survey of 58 DA white dwarfs. We report the discovery of the low-field magnetic white dwarf NLTT 2219 (Bl =  - 97 kG) and of the likely extremely low-field white dwarf NLTT 347. Our survey also led to the identification of the magnetic DAZ white dwarf NLTT 10480 [\citep=kaw2011]. Spectropolarimetric series of the high-field white dwarf NLTT 12758 revealed short-period ([formula] hr) polarity variations characteristic of a rotating dipole. We also noted radial velocity variations and a strong contrast in the strengths of the π and σ components suggesting that NLTT 12758 is a spectroscopic binary. Further work on this object is awaiting detailed Zeeman modelling and additional spectroscopic data to establish the periodicity of the radial velocity and field variations. The time series of NLTT 13015 also showed possible variations and the surface-averaged field spread from 6 to 7.5 MG. The precision of Hα velocity measurements also allowed us to identify potential close double degenerate stars such as the DA+DC NLTT 21913 and the single-lined DA white dwarfs NLTT 6559 and NLTT 31473. Incidentally, NLTT 31473 is also a member of the Galactic halo. [\citet=max1999] used their radial velocity survey to determine the fraction of double degenerate systems among white dwarfs to be between ~  2% and 19%. Including the likely double-degenerate NLTT 12758, we estimate the fraction of close double degenerates at [formula]%.

We exploited the present data to infer stellar (mass, age) and kinematical properties of this sample of relatively old high-proper motion white dwarfs. For instance, we identified two new halo white dwarf candidates (NLTT 31473 and NLTT 33503) among a sample of thin- or thick-disc white dwarfs.

The atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) obtained using spectroscopic and photometric data are in good agreement. The SDSS ugriz photometry allowed us for the first time to assess the effect of Lyα extended-wing opacities [\citep=kow2006] on the SDSS u - g colour index of cool DA white dwarfs.

The incidence of magnetism in white dwarfs has been reported to be as low as 4% [\citep=sch1995] when taking into account all magnetic field strengths, or ~  1% per decade interval. However, it was reported to be as high as 25% when considering only the very low-field white dwarfs [\citep=azn2004]. [\citet=azn2004] detected kG fields in three white dwarfs out of total 12, and when they extended their survey to an additional 10 objects they only reported one possible candidate [\citep=jor2007]. The combined survey hence reduced the incidence of kG fields in white dwarfs to 11 - 15%. [\citet=kaw2007] studied the incidence of magnetism in the Solar neighbourhood and found that [formula] of white dwarfs are magnetic. In the present survey of nearly 60 objects we uncovered three new low-field white dwarfs with strengths of the order of [formula] to [formula] kG implying a field incidence of [formula]%, or ~  1 - 2% per decade interval. The incidence observed in the present sample is similar to that observed by [\citet=sch1995].

The exact fraction remains uncertain because of inhomogeneous sampling and methodology. Figure [\ref=fig_cum] shows the cumulative distribution of low-field white dwarfs as a function of the field logarithm. The linear relation corresponds to a nearly flat distribution and is evidence that fields are distributed randomly rather than following a distribution pattern as found in Ap stars [\citep=aur2007]. Fields generated by a dynamo involving a common-envelope phase [\citep=tou2008] [\citep=pot2010] [\citep=nor2011] with a body varying in size, hence disposable energy, such as an asteroid, a planet, a brown dwarf, or a low-mass star are likely to vary in intensity as well. The random nature of the size of the body involved in the common-envelope phase should also result in random field intensity. Once the field is frozen into the stellar body, the decay time-scale is of the order of 109  -  1010 years [\citep=mus1995], i.e., comparable to the white dwarf cooling age. On the other hand, the Ap stars are still likely progenitors of high-field ([formula] G) white dwarfs.

Are two independent formation channels possible? [\citet=tou2008] argues that the absence of magnetic white dwarfs in non-interacting pairs implies that all magnetic white dwarfs are the products of interaction or merger. This syllogism does not exclude other possible channels if it can be shown that the failure to identify magnetic white dwarfs in non-interacting binaries is the result of a selection effect for this particular channel. For example, [\citet=car2002] found that ~  40% of Ap stars are in binaries. The inferred distribution of mass ratios implies that close to half of the progeny of Ap stars, i.e., the high-field magnetic white dwarfs, would be paired with luminous companions (G- to A-type) hence escaping detection, although the remainder would be paired with M- to K-type stars and should be detectable, at least during the early cooling stages. As noted by [\citet=tou2008], late-type companions remain elusive, but it remains to be shown that early-type companions are missing as well.

The stellar ages in this sample vary from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. The distribution of field strengths as a function of temperatures possibly reveals strong selections effects in the sample. Figure [\ref=fig_mag_age] shows that all stars from Table [\ref=tbl_low] and with a field ≤  50 kG are relatively young stars with cooling ages [formula] years. Conversely, all stars save two with a field stronger than 50 kG are older stars with cooling ages in excess of ~  109 years. Deep, narrow spectral lines are reliable field tracers but are also lacking in cool white dwarfs unless heavy element lines are present such as in the magnetic DAZ NLTT 43806 [\citep=zuc2011] or NLTT 10480 [\citep=kaw2011]. On the other hand, an explanation for the paucity of intermediate fields (100 kG-  1 MG) in younger white dwarfs is not readily available. Although these are the field and temperature ranges targeted in most spectropolarimetric surveys [\citep=azn2004], a larger survey may yet uncover the missing objects.

Photometric data

Images obtained during our P82 and P83 EFOSC programmes were obtained with either the V filter or the R filter. We employed a subset of stars also listed in the SDSS photometric survey to calibrate the EFOSC images. First, we computed synthetic relations between the SDSS g and r and the Johnson V and R magnitudes. Using a sequence of models at 0.6 [formula] and Teff = 5 to [formula] K we obtained and converted the set of SDSS gr magnitudes from Table [\ref=tbl_sdss] into Johnson V and R magnitudes. Next, we measured the count rates c from the acquisition images and calculated the instrumental magnitudes: Finally, simple linear relations were found between V (R) and V (R)acq. using the SDSS sample: with standard deviations ≈  0.01 mag for V and 0.03 mag for R. Having estimated the constants CV and CR, the calibration was applied to the whole EFOSC sample to measure V and R magnitudes. The uncertainty on the R magnitude of the faint companion to NLTT 17662 is larger at 0.05 mag. We employed airmass coefficients averaged over the V and R bands, kV  ≈  0.13 and kR  ≈  0.10 [\citep=pat2011]. The new magnitudes are listed in Table [\ref=tbl_obs] along with published V magnitudes and 2MASS J magnitudes [\citep=skr2006].

The images obtained during our P80 and P84 FORS programmes were obtained in white light. The CCD employed for the P80 observations was more sensitive in the blue and appropriate to estimate V magnitudes, while the CCD employed for the P84 observations was appropriate to estimate R magnitudes. We followed the procedure outlined above to calibrate the FORS images. The standard deviations were 0.04 and 0.03 mag for the V and R calibration stars, respectively.

Figure [\ref=figvpv] shows photographic [\citep=sal2003] and CCD photometric measurements (V) from our sample of stars. The photographic measurements are on average 0.1 mag brighter than the CCD measurements with a standard deviation of 0.29 mag.

Figure [\ref=fig_VRJ] shows the measured and synthetic V - J and R - J indices as a function of temperature. The blended 2MASS J measurements of the resolved binaries NLTT 17662 and NLTT 56045, and the composite colours of the close binary NLTT 21913 were excluded from the diagrams. The adopted effective temperature measurements are from Table [\ref=tbl_atm]. Excluding NLTT 11748 , the average deviation between predicted and measured V - J is + 0.046 mag with a standard deviation of 0.096 mag, while the average deviation for the R - J index is + 0.007 with a standard deviation of 0.119 mag. Applying the synthetic relations to the data, again excluding NLTT 11748, we calculated a reduced χ2 of ~  1.2 in the R - J diagram and ~  1.3 in the V - J diagram. The effect of crowded companions or dust is likely to affect the colours of a few of the outliers found in these diagrams. We noted a discrepancy of [formula] mag between the 2MASS J magnitude of NLTT 9940 and the [formula] measurement of [\citet=kil2010]. Opting for the latter, the revised V - J and R - J indices are in excellent agreement with the optical temperatures (see Section 3.5.4). We conclude that errors in optical and infrared magnitudes account for the dispersion. However, the R - J index of NLTT 56493 reveals an object markedly redder than expected suggesting a possible contamination of the 2MASS J measurement.

Radial velocity measurements

Table [\ref=tbl_rad_vel] list individual heliocentric velocity measurements using the Hα line. Quoted errors are statistical only, i.e., follow from the line core fit. We recommend to add 5 km s- 1 in quadrature to account for accidental shifts in the wavelength scale from night-to-night. The velocities are measured relative to Hα (λ0 = 6562.80Å) in non-magnetic stars and relative to the shifted π component of Hα computed at the appropriate field strength in NLTT 13015 (λπ = 6560.43Å). The velocity measurements of NLTT 17662B were corrected by adjusting the telluric lines of the B component with that of the A component because the spectra were obtained with the A component centred on the slit and the B component significantly off-centre. We calculated and applied a correction of + 34.4 km s- 1 to the spectra of NLTT 17662B.
