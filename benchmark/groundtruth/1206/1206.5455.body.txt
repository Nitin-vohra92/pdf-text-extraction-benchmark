Abstract

Entropy change in the Carnot cycle is discussed. In particular, the isentropic change in the adiabatic expansion (or compression) is reinvestigated.

Key Words: Carnot Cycle/ Adiabatic Process/ Entropy Change/

Introduction

Consider a heat engine filled with ideal gas molecules. Let the engine follow the Carnot cycle which is constructed from the known four processes:

[formula]

(see Fig. [\ref=CarnotCycle]). It is assumed that these processes are carried out under the reversible (quasi-static) conditions. Then the entropy S is defined by the differential form dS = dQ / T. So the entropy was originally introduced on the basis of the premise of the reversible (quasi-static) change.

It has been well established that S is a state function, and for this reason, ΔS is invariable, whether a path that links given two states is reversible or irreversible, if the initial and the final states are in equilibrium. Hence, for any cyclic process we must have

[formula]

In particular, for the Carnot cycle under discussion, we have

[formula]

The question is the first equality:

[formula]

The equality ([\ref=1-4]) is based on the general acceptance that ΔSB  →  C  =  ΔSD  →  A = 0, which is justified by the fact that no heat exchange occurs in the adiabatic process. This is logically true; in this sense there is no room to doubt eq. ([\ref=1-4]). However we note that the entropy is a state function and there is a change of state in the adiabatic process for instance, such that B(P2,V2,T1)  →  C(P3,V3,T2)  , so that it seems natural to consider that some change of the entropy may occur during the process, and hence to require a more rigorous proof for ΔSadiabatic = 0. Unfortunately, no inquiry into this problem has so far been made in the text books[\cite=Clausius] [\cite=Guggenheim] [\cite=Planck] [\cite=Sommerfeld] [\cite=Glasstone] [\cite=Moor] [\cite=Kittel] [\cite=Denbigh] [\cite=Callen] [\cite=Reif] [\cite=Gibbs] [\cite=Atkins] [\cite=Prigogine] [\cite=Schroeder]. This is the reason the author submitted this short article.

Thermodynamics is a deep physics. Through the analysis of the Carnot cycle, an idealized model of the steam engine, the amazing theorem in theoretical physics, the second law (ΔS  ≥  0), was deduced, having laid the foundation of chemical thermodynamics. Because of the depth and the vastness, for its full comprehension we must study repeatedly the series of basics from the classical to the statistical thermodynamics. In such circumstances, it seems essential to discuss more rigorously the validity of eq. ([\ref=1-4]).

Entropy Change in Adiabatic Process

To examine whether the change of the entropy occurs in the adiabatic process, let us consider the change of state of B(P2,V2,T1)  →  C(P3,V3,T2). Since S is a state function, the path B  →  C is separable, and we may construct an alternative route to the state C, for instance

[formula]

(a) Let the path B  →  X be an expansion process with no work and no heat exchange. The free expansion of gas molecules into the vacuum will correspond to this case. In that case the volume change occurs, but ΔQ = 0, ΔW = 0 and ΔU = 0 (PX, of course, satisfies the equality: PX = (V2 / V3)P2). (b) Let the path X  →  C be a process, during which the system releases ΔQ, but has no volume change.

For the path B  →  X, according to the Boltzmann formula, there is the entropy change of the form:

[formula]

while for the path X  →  C, there is the temperature drop T1  →  T2 of the system through the release of ΔQ to the heat reserver, which leads to the decrease of entropy.

Since U is a state function, we have

[formula]

Comparing the two routes, B  →  X  →  C and B  →  C , it must be that

[formula]

We may express eq. ([\ref=1-7]) in the differential form: dQ =  - PdV (equivalent heat). And we have

[formula]

The total entropy change throughout the adiabatic process thus becomes

[formula]

Applying the equation of state, PV = nRT, we arrive at the known result for the adiabatic process:

[formula]

As we can see, the increase of the entropy due to the volume expansion during the adiabatic process is exactly canceled out by the decrease of the entropy due to the release of the equivalent heat.

It is of interest to have the above discussion in the reverse order. We note that the entropy can be linked with the volume by the equation: [formula]. In the classic-thermodynamic point of view, V is a measure of the total number of cells (hence the number of states) which can be occupied by the molecules. There is a basis of the Boltzmann formula, S = k log W, in the Carnot cycle.
