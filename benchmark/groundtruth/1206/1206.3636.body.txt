Degenerations of Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds

Introduction

A Calabi-Yau manifold M is a projective manifold with trivial canonical bundle [formula]. Yau's theorem for Calabi conjecture (cf. [\cite=Ya1]) asserts that, for any Kähler class [formula], there exists a unique Ricci-flat Kähler metric g on M whose Kähler form ω represents α. The metric behavior of Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds is studied by various authors from many perspectives (cf. [\cite=An0], [\cite=CT], [\cite=GTZ], [\cite=GW2], [\cite=Kob1], [\cite=Lu1], [\cite=RoZ], [\cite=RZ], [\cite=Ti], [\cite=To], [\cite=To2], [\cite=Song], [\cite=Wi]). The present paper is a sequel to [\cite=RoZ], and we further investigate the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of Ricci-flat Kähler metrics under degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds.

The moduli space [formula] of a polarized Calabi-Yau manifold (M,L), i.e. a Calabi-Yau manifold M with an ample line bundle L, exists, and is a quai-projective variety (cf. [\cite=Vie]). Yau's theorem can be viewed as a map

[formula]

where gL is a Ricci-flat Kähler metric on M whose Kähler class represents c1(L), and X denotes the space of isometric classes of compact metric spaces with Gromov-Hausdorff topology. An interesting question is to understand the relationship between the closure of [formula] in X and the natural algebro-geometric compactification of [formula].

Assume that M is an (n + 1)-dimensional variety, π:M  →  Δ is a proper flat morphism from M to a disc [formula], M0  =  π- 1(0) is a singular projective variety, Mt  =  π- 1(t) is a smooth projective n-dimensional manifold for any [formula], and the relative canonical bundle KM  /  Δ is trivial on [formula]. Then for any [formula] Mt  =  π- 1(t) is a Calabi-Yau n-manifold, and (M,π) is called a degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds over the disc Δ. If L is an ample line bundle on M whose differential type is independent of t, then there is a map from [formula] to the moduli space [formula] of (Mt,L|Mt), and 0∈Δ corresponds to a point in the algebro-geometric compactification of [formula]. A Calabi-Yau variety is a projective Gorenstein normal variety M0 with trivial canonical sheaf [formula] and only canonical singularities.

In this paper we study the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of ((Mt,L|Mt)) when 0∈Δ represents a Calabi-Yau variety. The main result is:

Let (M,π) be a degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds over a disc [formula], and let L be an ample line bundle on M. Assume that M0 is a Calabi-Yau n-variety ([formula]) with singular set S, and the relative canonical bundle KM  /  Δ of (M,π) is trivial, i.e., [formula]. If t denotes the unique Ricci-flat Kähler metric with Kähler form [formula], [formula], then

[formula]

when t  →  0, in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, where (X,dX) denotes the metric completion of [formula], g is a Ricci-flat Kähler metric on [formula], and dg is the Riemannian distance function of g. Furthermore, [formula] is a closed subset of Hausdorff dimension less or qual to 2n - 4, and any tangent cone TxX, [formula], is not [formula].

In [\cite=RoZ], Theorem 1.1 is proved under an additional assumption that M0 admits a crepant resolution, i.e. a resolution :  →  M0 with [formula]. However, many Calabi-Yau varieties do not admit any crepant resolution, e.g. Calabi-Yau varieties of dimension 4 with only finite ordinary double points as singularities.

In [\cite=RoZ], it is proved under the hypothesis of Theorem [\ref=t1.1] that there is a uniform upper bound D > 0 for the diameter of (Mt,t), i.e.

[formula]

and furthermore, F*tt converges to a Ricci-flat Kähler metric g in the local C∞-sense on [formula], when t  →  0, where [formula] is a smooth family of embeddings with F0  =  id. However, very little is known about the metric behavior near singularities, and the global convergence. The Gromov pre-compactness theorem (cf. [\cite=G1]) asserts that, for any sequence tk  →  0, there is a subsequence (Mtk,tk) converging to a compact length metric space (X,dX) in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Moreover, the structure of the limit metric space X is studied by Cheeger Colding and Tian (cf. [\cite=CC1] [\cite=CC2] [\cite=CT]), and it is shown that there is a closed subset SX  ⊂  X of Hausdorff dimension less or equal to 2n - 4 such that any tangent cone TxX, x∈SX, is not [formula] and [formula] is a smooth manifold admitting a Ricci-flat Kähler metric g∞. These results will play a role in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

In Theorem [\ref=t1.1], we obtain that (X,dX) is isometric to the metric completion of [formula], and the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence takes place for the whole continuous parameter [formula], i.e. the Gromov-Hausdorff limit X is unique and thus is independent of the choice of subsequences of t. Furthermore, [formula] is isometric to [formula].

Finally, we remark that after this paper is completed, we notice that Theorem 1.2 in a preprint [\cite=DS] posted a few days ago (see also [\cite=Ti1]) implies that X is homeomorphic to M0. We also mention that the homeomorphism property was proved earlier for K3 surfaces in [\cite=Kob1], and for Calabi-Yau threefolds with only finite ordinary double points as singularities in [\cite=Song] by assuming the existence of crepant resolutions.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=t1.1]

Let (M,π) be a degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds with trivial relative canonical bundle KM  /  Δ, and let L be an ample line bundle on M. Then there is an embedding [formula] such that Lm  =  OΔ(1)|M for some [formula], π is a proper surjection given by the restriction of the projection from [formula] to Δ, and the rank of π* is 1 on [formula]. Denote

[formula]

where ωFS is the standard Fubini-Study metric on [formula], and gt is the corresponding Kähler metric of ωt. Let Ωt be a relative holomorphic volume form, i.e., a nowhere vanishing section of KM  /  Δ. Yau's theorem of Calabi's conjecture ([\cite=Ya1]) asserts that there is a unique Ricci-flat Kähler metric t with Kähler form [formula] for [formula], i.e., there is a unique function φt on Mt satisfying that [formula], and

[formula]

where σt is a constant depending only on t. By Lemma 3.1 in [\cite=RoZ],

[formula]

for a constant [formula] independent of t, and by Lemma 3.2 in [\cite=RoZ],

[formula]

for a constant C > 0 independent of t.

Denote [formula] the inclusion map induced by [formula]. Note that ft is holomorphic, i.e. [formula], [formula] and

[formula]

on Mt. Here the last inequality of ([\ref=eq2]) follows from ([\ref=eq1]). So ft is a family of Lipschitz maps with a uniform Lipschitz constant independent of t.

By Theorem 1.4 in [\cite=RoZ], the diameter of (Mt,t) is uniformly bounded, i.e.

[formula]

for a constant D indpendent of [formula]. Furthermore, for any smooth family of embeddings [formula] with F0  =  id,

[formula]

[formula] in the C∞-sense on any compact subset [formula], where φ0 is a smooth function, ω is a Ricci-flat Kähler form on [formula] obtained in [\cite=EGZ], and g is the corresponding Kähler metric of ω, i.e. [formula] and

[formula]

on [formula]. By [\cite=ZZ2], φ0 extends to a continuous function on M0, still denoted by φ0.

By Gromov compactness theorem (cf. [\cite=G1]), there is a subsequence (Mtk,tk) converging to a compact length metric space (X,dX) in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, i.e. there exists a ε(k)-approximation φk:Mtk  →  X where ε(k)  →  0 when k  →    ∞  .

Recall that the convergence for Riemannian manifolds with Ricci-curvature bounded from below was intensively studied by Cheeger and Colding (cf. [\cite=CC1] [\cite=CC2] etc.). Applying Section 6 and 7 of [\cite=CC1] to our circumstances, we conclude that there is a closed subset SX  ⊂  X of Hausdorff dimension [formula] such that, for any x∈SX, the tangent cone TxX is not isometric to [formula]. Furthermore, [formula] is a smooth open complex manifold, and [formula] is induced by a Ricci-flat Kähler metric g∞ on [formula]. By Section 7 of [\cite=CC1], tk smoothly converges to g∞ on [formula] under the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of (Mtk,tk) to (X,dX), i.e., there are compact subsets [formula] such that [formula], φk|φ- 1k(Kk):φ- 1k(Kk)  →  Kk can be chosen as diffeomorphisms and

[formula]

on any compact subset [formula] in the C∞-sense, where Jtk (resp. J∞) denotes the complex structure of Mtk (resp. [formula]).

The same argument as in the proof of Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=RZ] implies that, by passing to a subsequence, [formula] converges to a local isometric embedding [formula], i.e. for a [formula], there is a ρy > 0 such that dX(Ψ(y1),Ψ(y2)) = dg(y1,y2) for any y1,y2∈Bg(y,ρy). Moreover, for any [formula], Ftk(y)∈Mtk converges to a point x∈X under the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of (Mtk,tk) to (X,dX), and Ψ(y) = x.

A subsequence of [formula] converges to a continuous map [formula] which satisfies that f∞(X) = M0, [formula], and [formula] is holomorphic. Furthermore,

[formula]

in the C∞-sense on any compact subset [formula].

By ([\ref=eq2]), ftk are Lipschitz maps with a uniform Lipschitz constant independent of k. Hence, passing to a subsequence, [formula] converges to a continuous map [formula] when tk  →  0 (cf. [\cite=Rong]), i.e. for any sequence pk∈Mtk which converges to x∈X under the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of (Mtk,tk) to (X,dX), we have that ftk(pk) converges to f∞(x) in [formula]. From that [formula], we see that [formula]. Note that for any [formula], Ftk(y)∈Mtk converges to a point x∈X under the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of (Mtk,tk) to (X,dX), and Ftk(y) converges to y in [formula]. By the convergence of ftk, ftk(Ftk(y)) = Ftk(y) and F0  =  id, we have that f∞(x) = y. Thus [formula].

We claim that [formula] is holomorphic. Note that [formula] is holomorphic, i.e.

[formula]

where J denotes the complex structure of [formula]. Then [formula] is a harmonic map, and by ([\ref=eq2])

[formula]

for a constant C > 0 independent of k. In local coordinates on Mtk and [formula] we have

[formula]

where Γijl denotes the Christoffel symbols of gFS (cf. [\cite=Sc]). On any compact subset [formula], [formula] for a constant CK > 0 independent of k by the standard Schauder estimates (cf [\cite=GT]), since φ- 1k|*Kktk converges to g∞ in the C∞-sense, and [formula]. Here we identify K and φ- 1k(K) for k  ≫  1. The elliptic bootstrap estimates show that [formula] for any [formula] on K. Hence, passing a subsequence, ftk converges to f∞ smoothly on K, and, by the convergence of Jtk to J∞, f∞ is holomorphic, i.e.

[formula]

By the standard diagonal argument, f∞ is holomorphic on [formula].

[formula].

For any [formula], the tangent cone [formula] since Ψ is a local isometry. Thus [formula]. If we denote [formula], then f∞(E)  ⊂  S by [formula] and f∞(X) = M0. It suffices to show that E is empty.

Assume that E is not empty. Since [formula] is holomorphic, [formula] is a complex subvariety of [formula], and [formula] is bi-holomorphic. For any [formula], [formula]. Since M0 is normal, by Zariski's main theorem (cf [\cite=Ha]) Ey is a connected subvariety. If [formula], for all [formula], then Ey is a point, and the Hartogs' theorem shows that Ψ can extend to a holomorphic map from [formula] to [formula]. Hence [formula] is bi-holomorphic, which contradicts to y∈S is a singular point. Now we can assume that [formula] for a [formula].

Since f∞ is holomorphic on [formula], [formula] is a smooth (1,1)-form on [formula]. Since Ψ is local isometric embedding and [formula], f∞  =  Ψ- 1 and f*∞ω  =  ω∞ on [formula] respectively. By Lemma [\ref=c1], [formula] converges smoothly to [formula] on any compact subset [formula]. Note that [formula] with [formula] for a constant [formula] independent of k (See ([\ref=eq01])). Then

[formula]

As seen in the proof of Lemma 2.1, φ- 1, *ktk smoothly converges to ω∞ on any compact subset [formula]. By standard elliptic estimates, we have

[formula]

for any [formula] and a constant Cl,K > 0 independent of k. Hence there is a smooth function φ∞ on [formula] such that, passing to a subsequence [formula] converges smoothly to φ∞ on K, and

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=c1], for any [formula], [formula] converges to f∞(x) in [formula], and [formula]. Since Ftk(f∞(x)) converges to f∞(x) in [formula], and [formula] converges to φ0 on [formula] in the C∞-sense, we have

[formula]

Thus [formula] on [formula]. Note that φ0 is a continuous function on M0, and, hence, [formula] is a continuous function on [formula]. We obtain that [formula] on [formula], and φ∞|Ey  =  φ0(y) is a constant function, which implies [formula]. It is a contradiction, and thus E is empty.

Finally, we finish the proof. By Section 3 of [\cite=CC2], we obtain that for any [formula] and any δ > 0, there is a curve γδ connecting x1 and x2 in [formula] such that

[formula]

Thus (X,dX) is isometric to the metric completion of [formula]. By [\cite=CT], the Hausdorff dimension [formula].
