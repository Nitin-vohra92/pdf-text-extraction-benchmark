Introduction

The "minor" relation for graphs is well-established, but how it should be extended to digraphs is not clear. In this paper we discuss one such extension. To obtain a minor, we contract strongly-connected subdigraphs rather than edges. (A digraph G is strongly-connected if G is non-null and there exists a directed path from u to v for every u,v∈V(G).)

In digraphs, contracting an edge may yield a directed cycle, even starting from an acyclic digraph, and this seems undesirable for a theory of excluded minors. One way to avoid this is to only permit the contraction of certain edges. For example, if an edge uv is the only edge with tail u or the only edge with head v, then contracting uv does not yield a new directed cycle (see for instance [\cite=DTree]). Another way is to define a minor relation using minor mapping with certain conditions. See for instance [\cite=Nowhere].

A third way to extend minors of graphs to digraphs is as follows. For graphs, one can define contraction in terms of contracting edges, or in terms of contracting connected subgraphs, and it comes to the same thing. But for digraphs, the analogous two concepts are different. For digraphs, let us define contraction in terms of contracting strongly-connected subgraphs. More precisely, we say a digraph H is a minor of a digraph G if H can be obtained from a subdigraph of G by repeatedly contracting a strongly-connected subdigraph to a vertex. (Note that we do not create "new" directed cycles after contracting a strongly-connected subdigraph.) Equivalently, we can define this minor relation via minor mapping in the following way. A digraph H is a minor of a digraph G if there exists a mapping φ defined on V(H) such that:

for every v∈V(H), φ(v) is a non-null strongly-connected subdigraph of G,

if u,v∈V(H) and u  ≠  v, then φ(u) and φ(v) are vertex-disjoint,

for every u,v∈V(H) (not necessarily distinct), if there are k edges in H with tail u and head v, then there are at least k edges in G with head in V(φ(u)) and tail in V(φ(v)), and not contained in E(φ(x)) for any x∈V(H).

We call such a map φ a minor mapping from H to G.

We first give some definitions. Every digraph in this paper is finite. We say a digraph G is simple if it is loopless and there is at most one edge uv∈E(G) for every distinct u,v∈V(G). A simple digraph G is called semi-complete if either uv∈E(G) or vu∈E(G) for every distinct u,v∈V(G). A semi-complete digraph G is called a tournament if exactly one of uv and vu is an edge of G for every distinct u,v∈V(G).

An important property of minors for graphs is that they define a "well-quasi-order" [\cite=GM20]. A quasi-order Q  =  (E(Q),  ≤  Q) consists of a class E(Q) and a reflexive transitive relation ≤  Q on E(Q). A quasi-order Q is called a well-quasi-order or wqo if for every infinite sequence [formula] of elements of E(Q), there exist j > i  ≥  1 such that qi  ≤  Qqj. Neil Robertson and the second author proved that the class of all graphs is a wqo under the minor relation in [\cite=GM20]. Unfortunately, the analogous statement is not true for directed minors. For example, a small directed cycle is not a minor of a big directed cycle. However, what if we consider some subclass, say the class of all tournaments? (The subgraph relation does not define a wqo even for the class of all tournaments. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to find a counterexample.)

In this paper, we prove that minor containment defines a wqo for the class of all semi-complete digraphs. Therefore the same is true for the class of all tournaments. We also give counter-examples for some other classes containing all semi-complete digraphs.

The class of all semi-complete digraphs is a wqo under minor containment.

In [\cite=WQO], Maria Chudnovsky and the second author proved that the class of all semi-complete digraphs is a wqo under "immersion", by using a digraph parameter called "cut-width". Here, we prove the analogous statement for minors by using another parameter called path-width. Path-width for undirected graphs was introduced in [\cite=GM1], and it has a natural extension to digraphs, discussed for instance in [\cite=pathwidth].

For a digraph G, we say [formula] is a path-decomposition of G if:

r  ≥  1 ~  and [formula],

(betweenness condition) for 1  ≤  h  <  i  <  j  ≤  r, [formula], and

(cut condition) if uv∈E(G), then there exist i,j with 1  ≤  i  ≤  j  ≤  r such that u∈Wj and v∈Wi.

The betweenness condition implies that {i  :v∈Wi} is an integer interval for each v∈V(G), and the cut condition implies that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r there are no edges from [formula] to [formula] in [formula].

We define the width of a path-decomposition P as max 1  ≤  i  ≤  r|Wi|  -  1 and denote it by pw(P). We say G has path-width at most k if there exists some path-decomposition P of G with pw(P)  ≤  k and we denote the path-width of G by pw(G). For example, a non-null loopless digraph G is acyclic if and only if pw(G) = 0.

For a path-decomposition [formula], we denote min 1  ≤  i  ≤  r|Wi|, max 1  ≤  i  ≤  r|Wi|, W1, and Wr by m(P), M(P), F(P), and L(P), respectively. We first prove that having bounded path-width is a minor-closed property.

If a digraph has path-width at most k, then so do all its minors.

Proof.   Let [formula] be a path-decomposition of a digraph G. Then P is a path-decomposition of [formula] for each edge e∈E(G), and [formula] is a path-decomposition of [formula] for each vertex v∈V(G). Therefore the path-width of a digraph G does not increase by deleting an edge or a vertex.

Thus, it remains to show that if G has path-width at most k, then so does G / H where H is a strongly-connected subdigraph of G. (G / H is the digraph obtained from G by contracting H to a single vertex w). Let P = (W1,...,Wr) be a path-decomposition of G, and let [formula]. (1) IH is an integer interval. Suppose IH is not an integer interval. Take indices h < i < j such that h,j∈IH and i∉IH. Let [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula] and [formula], two sets {t  :u∈Wt} and {t  :v∈Wt} do not intersect. Since H is strongly-connected and [formula], there is a directed path from u to v in [formula]. However, this contradicts the cut condition since there are no edges from [formula] to [formula] in [formula]. This proves (1).

Let [formula] be a path-decomposition of G with pw(P)  ≤  k. Define Wi' by

[formula]

We claim that [formula] is a path-decomposition of G / H with pw(P')  ≤  k. The betweenness condition follows from (1). For the cut condition, we only need to consider edges incident with w in G / H. For an edge uw∈E(G / H), consider the corresponding edge uv∈E(G). By the cut condition for P, there exist i  ≤  j such that Wj∋u and Wi∋v. Therefore Wj'∋u and Wi'∋w. The same argument applies for edges with tail w. Finally, pw(P')  ≤  pw(P)  ≤  k from the definition of P'. This proves [\ref=closed].

We introduce a notion and a theorem from [\cite=pathwidth]. For a digraph G, let A,B and C be mutually disjoint subsets of V(G). We say (A,B,C) is a k-triple if

|A|  =  |B|  =  |C|  =  k,

ab∈E(G) for every a∈A and b∈B,

bc∈E(G) for every b∈B and c∈C, and

A,C can be numbered as [formula] and [formula] respectively such that ciai∈E(G) for [formula].

Let (A,B,C) be a k-triple of a digraph G. Then G contains every semi-complete digraph with k vertices as a minor.

Proof.   Let [formula] and [formula] be numberings of A and C such that ciai∈E(G) for [formula]. Take an ordering [formula] of B. Then G|{ai,bi,ci} is strongly-connected for each i. Let G' be the digraph obtained from [formula] by contracting G|{ai,bi,ci} to a single vertex for each i. Then |V(G')|  =  k and uv∈E(G') for every distinct u,v∈V(G'). Therefore every semi-complete digraph with k vertices is a subgraph of G' and hence, a minor of G. This proves [\ref=triple].

The following theorem says a semi-complete digraph has large path-width if and only if it has a large k-triple.

For every set S of semi-complete digraphs, the following are equivalent:

There exists k such that every member of S has path-width at most k.

There is a digraph H such that no subdivision of H is a subdigraph of any member of S.

There exists k such that for each G∈S, there is no k-triple in G.

There exists k such that for each G∈S, there do not exist k vertices of G that are pairwise k-connected.

There is a digraph H such that for each G∈S, G does not contain H as a minor.

Proof.   The equivalence of the first four statements was proved by Alexandra Fradkin and the second author in [\cite=pathwidth]. Here, we prove 1 ⇒   5 ⇒   3 to extend the theorem.

Suppose 1 holds for k and S and let H be a digraph with pw(H)  >  k. Then 5 holds by [\ref=closed]. Now, suppose 5 holds for H and S. Let H' be a simple digraph containing H as a minor. Then 5 holds for H' and S as well. By [\ref=triple], G has no |V(H')|-triple for each G∈S. Therefore 3 holds. This proves [\ref=path1].

Thanks to [\ref=path1], it is enough to show the following statement to prove [\ref=main1].

For all k  ≥  0, the class of all semi-complete digraphs with path-width ≤  k is a wqo under minor containment.

Proof of [\ref=main1], assuming [\ref=main2].   Let [formula] be an infinite sequence of semi-complete digraphs. We may assume Gi does not contain G1 as a minor for each i  ≥  2. From [\ref=path1], there exists k such that every member of [formula] has path-width at most k. From [\ref=main2], there exist j > i  ≥  2 such that Gi is a minor of Gj. This proves [\ref=main1].

Most of the remainder of this paper is devoted to proving [\ref=main2]. In section 2, we show the existence of a "linked" path-decomposition; and use it in sections 3 and 4 to prove a slightly more general version of [formula]. In section 5, we give counter-examples to the analogue of [\ref=main1] for some super-classes of the class of all semi-complete digraphs.

Linked path-decompositions

In this section, we make a particular choice of path-decomposition, which will be used in subsequent sections. Roughly speaking, we will break this path-decomposition into a sequence of small path-decompositions in the natural way, so that we can apply Higman's sequence theorem to this sequence.

We first give some definitions. A directed path P in a semi-complete digraph G is induced if vivj∉E(G) for j - i  ≥  2 where [formula] are the vertices of P in order. Note that G|V(P) is strongly-connected unless it is a one-edge directed path. For two sets A and B, denote by AΔB the symmetric difference [formula]. For a digraph G, we say (C,D) is a separation of G of order s if:

[formula],

[formula], and

there are no edges uv∈E(G) such that [formula] and [formula].

If A,B  ⊆  V(G), a separation (C,D) of G separates A,B if A  ⊆  C and B  ⊆  D. A path-decomposition [formula] of a digraph G is called a linked path-decomposition if:

(increment condition) |Wi  ~  Δ  ~  Wi + 1|  =  1 for [formula],

(cardinality condition) |W1|  =  |Wr|  =  m(P), and

(linked condition) if |Wi|  ≥  t for every i with h  ≤  i  ≤  j, then there exist t vertex-disjoint directed paths from Wh to Wj.

Observe that for every v∉W1, there exists a unique i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1 such that [formula], and for every v∉Wr, there exists a unique j with 1  ≤  j  ≤  r - 1 such that [formula]. Therefore the increment condition implies that [formula]. In particular, r is bounded above by 2|V(G)| + 1. We now prove the existence of a linked path-decomposition in a semi-complete digraph.

Let G be a semi-complete digraph and A,B  ⊆  V(G) with |A|  =  |B|  =  m  ≥  0. Suppose there exist m vertex-disjoint directed paths from A to B in G, and there exists a path-decomposition (not necessarily linked) P of G such that F(P)  =  A, L(P)  =  B, and M(P)  ≤  k for some k. Then there exists a linked path-decomposition P' such that F(P')  =  A, L(P')  =  B, and M(P')  ≤  k.

In particular, every semi-complete digraph G with pw(G)  ≤  k has a linked path-decomposition P with pw(P)  ≤  k and m(P)  =  0.

Proof.   Observe that we can obtain a path-decomposition P' with F(P')  =  A, L(P') = B and M(P')  ≤  k satisfying the increment condition, by modifying P as follows: we remove (one of) any two consecutive sets that are equal, and insert appropriate sets between sets that differ by more than one vertex. The cardinality condition for P' is guaranteed by the existence of m vertex-disjoint paths from A to B.

Now, among all the path-decompositions [formula] of G with F(P)  =  A, L(P)  =  B, and M(P)  ≤  k satisfying the increment condition and the cardinality condition, we take one with [formula] "lexicographically maximal", where nj  =  |{i:|Wi|  =  j}| for [formula]. (More precisely, take one with n0 as large as possible; subject to that, take n1 as large as possible; and so on.) We can take such a path-decomposition since r is bounded above by 2|V(G)| + 1. Let P' be the path-decomposition we choose. We show P' satisfies the linked condition.

Let [formula]. Suppose that |Wi|  ≥  t for every i with h  ≤  i  ≤  j and there do not exist t vertex-disjoint directed paths from Wh to Wj. Then from Menger's theorem, there is a separation (C,D) of order less than t that separates [formula], [formula]. Take such a separation (C,D) with minimum order s. We claim that there exist two path-decompositions

[formula]

of G|C with WCi  =  Wi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  h, [formula], and M(PC)  ≤  k, and

[formula]

of G|D with [formula], WDi  =  Wi for j  ≤  i  ≤  r, and M(PD)  ≤  k. Then we will show that the "concatenation" of the two path-decompositions yields a path-decomposition lexicographically better than P', which contradicts our choice of P'.

We construct PC as follows. Note that there exist s vertex-disjoint paths from Wh to Wj by the minimality of s. Take s vertex-disjoint directed paths [formula] from [formula] to [formula] with minimal union. For 1  ≤  l  ≤  s, the minimality of the union of [formula] implies that Pl is induced and no vertex of Pl belongs to [formula] except its first vertex. Since there is no edge from [formula] to [formula] in [formula], it follows that the first vertex of Pl belongs to Wh. Similarly, the last vertex of Pl belongs to Wj, and no other vertex of Pl belongs to [formula]. Let [formula]. (1) For 1  ≤  l  ≤  s, [formula] is an integer interval containing j. If [formula] is strongly-connected, then (1) holds by the same argument as (1) in the proof of [\ref=closed]. Therefore we may assume [formula] has exactly two vertices u,v with one edge uv, since Pl is induced. By the cut condition for the edge uv, there exist a,b with 1  ≤  a  ≤  b  ≤  r such that u∈Wb and v∈Wa. Since no vertex of Pl except its last is in [formula], it follows that b < j. Since [formula] and a  ≤  b  ≤  j, it follows that v∈Wb. In summary, there exists b with 1  ≤  b < j such that u,v∈Wb.

On the other hand, [formula] and [formula] are both integer intervals by the betweenness condition. Since they intersect, the set in question is also an integer interval since it is the union of the two intersecting intervals. This proves (1).

For each i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  j, define

[formula]

Let [formula]. (2) PC is a path-decomposition of G|C with WCi  =  Wi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  h, [formula], and M(PC)  ≤  k. It is easy to check that [formula], and the betweenness condition follows from (1). For the cut condition, we only need to consider edges incident with pl in G|C and this is trivial since

[formula]

Therefore PC is a path-decomposition of G|C.

For 1  ≤  i  ≤  h, WCi  =  Wi since Wi  ⊆  C. And [formula] since Wj  ⊆  D. Finally, M(PC)  ≤  M(P)  ≤  k since |WCi|  ≤  |Wi| for every i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  j. This proves (2).

Similarly, let [formula], where

[formula]

for each i with h  ≤  i  ≤  r, then it is a path-decomposition of G|D with [formula], WDi  =  Wi for j  ≤  i  ≤  r, and M(PD)  ≤  k.

Let P* be the path-decomposition of G obtained by concatenating PC and PD and refining it to satisfy the increment condition. Then P* is "lexicographically better" than P' since every Wa with |Wa|  ≤  s is a term in the sequence P* (because WCi  =  Wi for 1  ≤  i  ≤  h and WDi  =  Wi for j  ≤  i  ≤  r, and |Wi| > s for h  ≤  i  ≤  j), and there exists at least one more set of size s, namely [formula]. This proves [\ref=linked].

Labeled minors

In this section, for a wqo Q and a semi-complete digraph G, we assign an element of E(Q) to each vertex of G, and we fix a linked path-decomposition P of G together with m(P) vertex-disjoint directed paths from F(P) to L(P). We define a minor relation for these slightly more general objects and prove a well-quasi-order theorem for them. Then [\ref=main2] will follow as an corollary. Roughly speaking, we need this "Q-labeling" in order to handle the case when one of the induced directed paths has length one so that we may not contract it.

For integers m,k with k  ≥  m  ≥  0 and a well-quasi-order Q, we say D  =  (G,P,R,l) is a (Q,m,k)-digraph if:

G is a semi-complete digraph,

P is a linked path-decomposition of G with m(P)  =  m and M(P)  ≤  k,

[formula] is a sequence of m vertex-disjoint induced directed paths from F(P) to L(P) in G, and

l is a mapping from V(G) to E(Q).

Note that [formula] for each [formula]. We say the vertex in [formula] is the i-th source root of D and the vertex in [formula] is the i-th terminal root of D. We denote the collection of all (Q,m,k)-digraphs by Gkm(Q). We say D is trivial if r = 1 where [formula]. Note that |V(G)|  =  m if D is trivial.

Now we define a minor relation on Gkm(Q). Let D  =  (G,P,R,l) , D'  =  (G',P',R',l') ∈Gkm(Q). Let ai and ai' be the i-th source roots of D and D', respectively, and similarly let bi and bi' be the i-th terminal roots of D and D', respectively. We say D is a minor of D' if there exists a minor mapping φ from G to G' such that:

ai'∈V(φ(ai)) and bi'∈V(φ(bi)) for [formula], and

for every v∈V(G), l(v)  ≤  Ql'(u) for some u∈V(φ(v)).

Again, we call φ a minor mapping from D to D'.

Next, we define a "decomposition" of a (Q,m,k)-digraph. Let D = (G,P,R,l) be a (Q,m,k)-digraph with [formula], [formula] and suppose |Ws|  =  m for some s with 1  <  s  <  r. Let [formula] and define D|A  =  (GA,PA,RA,lA) by:

GA  =  G|A,

[formula],

[formula], and

lA  =  l|A.

Then D|A is a (Q,m,k)-digraph and similarly, D|B is a (Q,m,k)-digraph where [formula]. We write [formula] and say D is decomposable. We denote the class of all non-trivial non-decomposable (Q,m,k)-digraphs by km(Q). More precisely, we say D = (G,P,R,l)∈Gkm(Q) is in km(Q) if:

r  ≥  3, and |Wi|  >  m for every i with 2  ≤  i  ≤  r - 1 where [formula].

Note that [formula] is a linked path-decomposition of G with m(P')  =  m + 1, F(P')  =  W2  ⊇  W1, and L(P')  =  Wr - 1  ⊇  Wr. Let R' be a sequence of m + 1 vertex-disjoint induced directed paths from W2 to Wr - 1. Then we see that each D = (G,P,R,l)∈km(Q) yields at least one member D' = (G,P',R',l)∈Gkm + 1. (Notice that it could be the case that some path in R' joins the i-th source root of D to the j-th terminal root of D for some j  ≠  i.)

Let m,k be integers with k  >  m  ≥  0. Suppose Gkm + 1(Q) is a wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q. Then km(Q) is a wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q as well.

Proof.   Let Q be a wqo and [formula] be an infinite sequence in km(Q). For each Di  =  (Gi,Pi,Ri,li), let Di' = (Gi,Pi',Ri',li)∈Gkm + 1(Q) as described earlier. Recall that every source root of Di is also a source root of Di', and every terminal root of Di is also a terminal root of Di'.

For each i  ≥  1, let [formula] be injections defined by

the t-th source root of Di equals the σi(t)-th source root of Di'.

the t-th terminal root of Di equals the τi(t)-th terminal root of Di'.

Since there are only finitely many pairs (σi,τi), there exists some (σ,τ) such that (σi,τi)  =  (σ,τ) for infinitely many i. Therefore we may assume σi  =  σ and τi  =  τ for every i  ≥  1.

Since Gkm + 1(Q) is a wqo under minor containment, Di' is a minor of Dj' for some i < j with some minor mapping φ. Then φ is also a minor mapping from Di to Dj. This proves [\ref=extendable].

We say D  =  (G,P,R,l)∈Gkm(Q) is contractible if

G|V(Rj) is strongly-connected for every [formula] where [formula].

We denote the set of all non-contractible (Q,m,k)-digraphs by km(Q).

Suppose G∈km(Q). In other words, G|V(Rj) is not strongly-connected for some j. Then G|V(Rj) must be a digraph with two vertices, namely the j-th source root u and the j-th terminal root v, and one edge uv. Note that every Wi contains either u or v where [formula]. Let [formula], [formula] for [formula], and [formula]. Then P̂ is a path-decomposition (not necessarily linked) of G' with M(P̂)  ≤  k - 1. Note that we still have m - 1 vertex-disjoint paths from [formula] to [formula]. From [\ref=linked], there exists a linked path-decomposition P' of G' with [formula], [formula], m(P')  =  m - 1, and M(P')  ≤  k - 1. Also, the sequence R' obtained from R by omitting Rj is a sequence of m - 1 vertex-disjoint induced directed paths from F(P') to L(P'). For labels, let Q' be a well-quasi-order defined by

E(Q')  =  E(Q)  ×  {0,1,2}  ×  {0,1,2}, and

(q,x,y)  ≤  Q'(q',x',y') if and only if q  ≤  Qq' and x  =  x' and y  =  y'.

For each [formula], let

[formula]

[formula]

Let l' be a mapping from V(G') to E(Q') defined by

l'(w)  =  (l(w),x(w),y(w)) for each [formula].

Then D'  =  (G',P',R',l')∈Gk - 1m - 1(Q') and we see that each D∈km(Q) yields at least one member D' in Gk - 1m - 1(Q').

Let m,k be integers with k  ≥  m  ≥  1. Suppose Gk - 1m - 1(Q) is a wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q. Then km(Q) is a wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q as well.

Proof.   Let Q be a wqo and [formula] be an infinite sequence in km(Q). For each Di  =  (Gi,Pi,Ri,li), let Di'  =  (Gi',Pi',Ri',li')∈Gk - 1m - 1(Q') as described earlier and let ui and vi be the source root and the terminal root of (Gi,Pi,Ri,li) such that [formula]. Since Q is a wqo, we may assume

li(ui)  ≤  Qlj(uj), and li(vi)  ≤  Qlj(vj) for every i < j.

Since Gk - 1m - 1(Q') is a wqo under minor containment, there exist i,j with 1  ≤  i  <  j such that Di' is a minor of Dj' with a minor mapping φ'. Define φ from Di to Dj as

[formula]

Then it is easy to check that φ is a minor mapping from Di to Dj, by the definition of Q'-labels. This proves [\ref=almost].

For two subclasses A,B of Gkm(Q), denote by [formula] the class of all (Q,m,k)-digraphs D which are decomposable as [formula] where DA∈A and DB∈B.

If A,B  ⊆  Gkm(Q) are both wqo under minor containment, then [formula] and [formula] are both wqo under minor containment.

Proof.   [formula] is a wqo under minor containment because every infinite sequence in [formula] contains either an infinite subsequence in A or an infinite subsequence in B.

For [formula], let [formula] be an infinite sequence in [formula]. Let [formula] where Dai  =  (Gai,Pai,Rai,lai)∈A and Dbi  =  (Gbi,Pbi,Rbi,lbi)∈B for each i  ≥  1. Then there exist i < j such that:

Dai is a minor of Daj with minor mapping φa, and

Dbi is a minor of Dbj with minor mapping φb.

Define a mapping φ from Di to Dj by

[formula]

Since the union of two strongly-connected subdigraphs with non-empty intersection is also strongly-connected, [formula] is strongly-connected in Gj for each [formula]. Then it is easy to check that φ is a minor mapping from Di to Dj. This proves [\ref=union].

Links, and the main proof

We say a contractible (Q,m,k)-digraph D (∉km(Q)) is a link if:

[formula].

We denote the collection of all links in Gkm(Q) by Lkm(Q). The following is an easy corollary of [\ref=union].

Suppose km(Q) and km(Q) are wqo under minor containment for some wqo Q. Then Lkm(Q) is a wqo under minor containment as well.

Now, we decompose D∈Gkm(Q) into links (possibly except the last term) to apply Higman's sequence theorem.

Let D = (G,P,R,l) be a non-trivial (Q,m,k)-digraph. Then [formula] (perhaps with t  =  1) such that:

Di∈Lkm(Q) for [formula], and

[formula].

Proof.   We may assume D is contractible since otherwise D∈km(Q) and the result holds with t  =  1. Let [formula]. We proceed by induction on r. For the base case r = 3, D belongs to km(Q) and hence, D itself is a link.

Let [formula] be the indices such that

[formula]

Let j  >  1 be the smallest index such that the initial segment [formula] is contractible (such j exists since D is contractible).

If j  =  2, then the initial segment [formula] belongs to km(Q), and hence it is a link. If j  >  2, then

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, in either case, [formula] is a link. If j  =  s, then D is a link, and we are done. Otherwise, [formula] is non-trivial and satisfies the statement by the induction hypothesis. Therefore

[formula]

satisfies the statement as well. This proves [\ref=concatenation].

Let Q be a quasi-order. We define a quasi-order Q<  ω on the set of all finite sequences of elements of E(Q). Let [formula] and [formula] be sequences of elements of E(Q). Then p  ≤  Q<  ωq if and only if:

a  ≤  b, and

there exist [formula] such that pi  ≤  Qqαi for every [formula].

It is proved in [\cite=Higman] that

If Q is a wqo, then so is Q<  ω.

The following is an easy corollary of [\ref=Higman1].

Suppose Q1,Q2 and Q3 are wqo. Let Q be a quasi-order with E(Q) the set of all finite sequences [formula] with a  ≥  2 such that p1∈E(Q1), [formula] and pa∈E(Q3). For [formula] and [formula], let p  ≤  Qq if and only if:

a  ≤  b, and

there exist [formula] such that p1  ≤  Q1q1, pa  ≤  Q3qb, and pi  ≤  Q2qαi for every [formula].

Then Q is a wqo.

Next, we prove a key lemma for [\ref=main2].

Let m,k be integers with k  >  m  ≥  1. Suppose Gk - 1m - 1(Q) and Gkm + 1(Q) are both wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q. Then Gkm(Q) is a wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q.

Proof.   Let [formula] be an infinite sequence of Gkm(Q). We may assume Di is non-trivial for every i  ≥  1 because every trivial Di has m vertices. Decompose each Di as

[formula]

as in [\ref=concatenation]. By [\ref=extendable], [\ref=almost], and [\ref=link], Lkm(Q) and km(Q) are both well-quasi-ordered under minor containment. Therefore we may assume ti  ≥  3 for every i  ≥  1. We apply [\ref=Higman2] for Q1  =  Q2  =  Lkm(Q), [formula]. Then there exist i < j with ti  ≤  tj and [formula] such that:

Dpi is a minor of Dαpj with a minor mapping φp for every 1  ≤  p  ≤  ti .

For each w∈V(Gi), let wl  ≤  wr be the indices such that wl  =   min {l:w∈V(Gli)}, and wr  =   max {r:w∈V(Gri)}. If wl  <  wr, then w must be on one of the m vertex-disjoint induced directed paths of Di, and let Rw be the path.

Now, define φ from Di to Dj by

[formula]

Note that Gαj|V(Rw) is strongly-connected since Dαj is a link. Then φ is a minor mapping from Di to Dj. This proves [\ref=mainlemma].

Let m,k be integers with k  ≥  m  ≥  0. Then Gkm(Q) is a wqo under minor containment for every wqo Q.

Proof.   We proceed by induction on k. For fixed k, we use induction on k - m. For the base case k  =  m, every member D∈Gkm(Q) is trivial and hence the statement holds. For the inductive step, since Gk - 1m - 1(Q) and Gkm + 1(Q) are wqo by the inductive hypotheses, the statement follows from [\ref=mainlemma]. This proves [\ref=maintheorem].

Proof of [\ref=main2].   Let [formula] be an infinite sequence of semi-complete digraphs with path-width at most k. Let Q be a wqo with E(Q)  =  {0}. For each i  ≥  1, let Pi be a linked path-decomposition of Gi with m(Pi)  =  0 and pw(Pi)  ≤  k. Let Ri  =  () be the empty sequence, let li be the constant mapping from V(Gi) to {0}, and let Di  =  (Gi,Pi,Ri,li). Since Di∈Gk + 10(Q) for each i  ≥  1, there exist j  >  i  ≥  1 such that Di is a minor of Dj by [\ref=maintheorem]. Therefore Gi is a minor of Gj. This proves [\ref=main2].

Counter-examples

In this section, we give some counter-examples for some classes of digraphs containing all semi-complete digraphs.

A digraph G is a super-tournament if either uv∈E(G) or vu∈E(G) for every distinct u,v∈V(G). In particular, a simple super-tournament is a semi-complete digraph. We give a counter-example to show that the class of all super-tournaments is not a wqo under minor containment; and indeed, the subclass of all super-tournaments with no three edges mutually parallel is not a wqo.

For i  ≥  3, let Ti be a transitive tournament with i vertices [formula] such that vavb∈E(Ti) if and only if a  <  b. Let Gi be a super-tournament obtained from Ti by doubling the following i edges:

[formula]

("Doubling" means adding a new edge with the same head and tail as the given edge.) We claim that Gi is not a minor of Gj for j > i  ≥  3. First, we cannot contract anything from Gj because Gj has no directed cycles. Therefore Gj must have Gi as a subdigraph in order to contain it as a minor. However, note that the underlying undirected graph of Gi has a cycle of length i with all edges doubled, while Gj does not. Therefore Gi is not a subdigraph of Gj and hence, not a minor of Gj.

The stability number for a digraph G is the maximum size of an independent set in the underlying undirected graph of G. For example, a non-null semi-complete digraph has stability number one. We give a counter-example for the class of simple digraphs with stability number at most two.

For i  ≥  2, let Ai  =  {a1,a2,a3}, Bi  =  {b1,b2,b3}, [formula], and [formula]. Let Gi be a simple digraph with stability number two defined as follows. (See figure 1.)

V(Gi) is the disjoint union of Ai,Bi,Ci and Di,

Gi|Ai, Gi|Bi are directed triangles,

Gi|Ci, Gi|Di are transitive tournaments,

Ai is complete to Ci,

Di is complete to Bi,

b1a1 is the only edge between Ai and Bi.

Each edge between Ci and Di goes from Ci to Di, and the bipartite graph underlying [formula] is a Hamiltonian cycle.

There are no other edges between [formula] and [formula].

We claim that there do not exist j > i  ≥  2 such that Gi is a minor of Gj. For suppose Gi is a minor of Gj with minor mapping φ. First, observe the following fact.

If H is a strongly-connected subdigraph of Gj with |V(H)|  ≥  2, then either Aj  ⊆  V(H) or Bj  ⊆  V(H) or b1a1∈E(H).

Therefore once we contract a non-trivial strongly-connected subdigraph H of Gj, there do not exist two disjoint directed cycles. That means we cannot contract anything in Gj if we hope to obtain Gi as a minor. Therefore φ must be a subdigraph mapping and φ(Ai)  =  Gj|Aj and φ(Bi) = Gj|Bj in order to preserve the existence of two disjoint directed cycles with an edge between them. Then φ(Ci) and φ(Di) are subdigraphs of Gj|Cj and Gj|Dj, respectively. However, the underlying bipartite graph of [formula] is a cycle of length 2j, and hence does not contain a cycle of length 2i as a subgraph, a contradiction. This proves our claim.
