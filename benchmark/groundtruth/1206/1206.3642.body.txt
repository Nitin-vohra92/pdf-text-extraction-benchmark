Consider a countable set P, whose elements will be called polymers. Let I be a subset of P2(P), the set of all subsets of P with two elements. We say that two polymers γ and γ' are incompatible if {γ,γ'}∈I or if γ  =  γ', and we will also write [formula]. If [formula] we say that the two polymers are compatible and we write γ  ~  γ'.

Assume that a complex valued function φ(γ), γ∈P, is given. We call φ(γ) the weight, or the activity, of the polymer γ. For any finite subset Λ  ⊂  P, the partition function Z(Λ) of the polymer system is defined by

[formula]

The sum runs over all subsets X of Λ such that γ  ~  γ' for any two distinct elements of X. If X contains only one element, X is considered a compatible subset, and if [formula], the product is interpreted as the number 1.

We introduce the following function on P  ×  P

[formula]

Let Gn, [formula] be the set of connected graphs with n vertices, [formula]. We consider undirected graphs without multiple edges, equivalently defined by a subset of [formula] which determines the edges. Given g∈Gn we define the value of g on a sequence [formula] as

[formula]

where (i,j)∈g means that the graph g has an edge connecting i with j. We also define G1 as the set containing only one graph g having only one vertex (and no edges) and write

[formula]

Proof. The partition function can be written as

[formula]

and developing the second product

[formula]

The theorem is proved.

With any finite sequence [formula] we associate the graph θ(Γ) with vertices [formula] obtained by drawing an edge between the vertices i and j if [formula] and also if γi  =  γj. We observe that [formula] only if θ(Γ) is a connected graph (i.e., if θ(Γ)∈Gn) and g∈Gn is a subgraph of θ(Γ). Then

[formula]

where |g| is the number of edges of the graph g. In other words, aT(Γ) is equal to the number of connected subgraphs of θ(Γ) with an even number of edges minus the number of connected subgraphs with an odd number of edges. If the graph θ(Γ) is not connected, aT(Γ) = 0.

We observe that the [formula], [formula], are symmetric functions. Thus, we can write the considered expansions also in terms of multi-indices instead of finite sequences. A multi-index X on a set P is a function X(γ), γ∈P, taking non-negative integer values and such that [formula] is a finite set or, equivalently, such that [formula] is a finite number. We denote by M(Λ) the set of multi-indices defined on Λ.

If X is a given multi-index and [formula], n = |X|, one of the sequences corresponding to X, we define aT(X) = aT(Γ), and a new function

[formula]

Taking into account that the number of different sequences Γ associated to X is [formula], the statement in theorem [\ref=T1] can be written as

[formula]

The multi-indices such that [formula] (i.e., whose associated graph θ(Γ) is connected) will be called clusters.

We first prove the following lemma.

Proof of lemma [\ref=L1]. We introduce the partition function

[formula]

for which

[formula]

If inequality ([\ref=i4]) is satisfied, we have

[formula]

showing that lemma [\ref=L1] is equivalent to the fact that all terms in the expansion of -   ln Z*(Λ) are positive. This fact will be proved by an induction argument on the subsets Λ. It certainly holds when Λ contains only one polymer. Assume that it holds for a given Λ and let [formula]. From the definition of Z* we see that

[formula]

with Λ0  =  {γ∈Λ:γ  ~  γ0}, and

[formula]

On the other hand, we have

[formula]

This shows the positivity of all the terms in the expansion of the second term in the right hand side of equation ([\ref=18]) (remark that the series expansions of the functions exp x and -   ln (1 - x) have only positive terms for [formula]). Since, by assumption, this is also the case for the first term, it follows that also [formula] satisfies the induction hypothesis. The lemma is proved.

Proof of theorem [\ref=T2]. We use again an induction argument on the subsets Λ. Assume that, for a given Λ and any γ∈Λ, the following estimate holds

[formula]

This inequality can also be written as

[formula]

and, for all Λ'  ⊂  Λ, it implies

[formula]

and, in particular,

[formula]

because [formula]. Since Λ does not contain γ0, we get

[formula]

and, taking the assumption ([\ref=i1]) of the theorem into account,

[formula]

Then, using ([\ref=18]) and the fact that -   ln (1 - x) is an increasing function of x, for any real x in the interval - 1 < x < 1, we obtain

[formula]

This proves the induction hypothesis ([\ref=20]) for [formula], and therefore for all Λ (being valid when Λ contains only one element). Statement ([\ref=i2]) of the theorem is proved.

Finally, if γ0∈Λ and Λ0 is defined as above, we have

[formula]

Then, the statement ([\ref=i3]) follows from hypothesis ([\ref=i1]), taking into account inequality ([\ref=22]) and that now Λ contains γ0. This ends the proof of the theorem.

The following consequences of the theorem concern the correlation functions and the truncated correlation functions. Notice that, for Λ finite and [formula], these functions can be written as

[formula]

with Λi  =  {γ∈Λ:γ  ~  γi}.

Proof. Expressions ([\ref=30]), ([\ref=31]) and ([\ref=32]) show that the corresponding expansions in terms of the φT(X) are

[formula]

where [formula] is the set of X whose support contains a γ incompatible with one of the γi, [formula]. The corollary follows from the convergence of these expansions stated in theorem [\ref=T2]. A simple extension of the argument leading to inequality ([\ref=i4]) proves the inequality stated in the corollary.

Proof. Theorem [\ref=T2] and assumption ([\ref=36]) imply the bound

[formula]

Taking into account equation ([\ref=32]) and that

[formula]

we obtain the stated estimate ([\ref=37]) from this bound.

Bibliographical note

The rigorous study of perturbation series in statistical mechanics has quite a long history since the times when Lebowitz and Penrose proved the convergence of the virial expansion [\cite=1], or the earlier result by Groeneveld [\cite=0] in the case of repulsive potentials (using an alternating sign property similar to that of Lemma 1). Other related early works are described in [\cite=2],[\cite=3]. In this context, polymer systems and the corresponding expansions, also called cluster expansions, have a particular interest as they permitted to analyze, among other questions, high and low temperature properties in the case of lattice systems (see, for instance, [\cite=4] chapter V). There are several approaches to the proof of the convergence of cluster expansions: one is based on the use of Kirkwood-Salsburg type of equations [\cite=5],[\cite=6], others in bounding each term of the series by some combinatorics of trees on a graph [\cite=7],[\cite=8], [\cite=4] (chapter V). In [\cite=9] such bounds were obtained from a recurrence relation similar to the one used here in the first part of the proof, and in [\cite=10] the Möbius inversion formula was used. In a recent work [\cite=11], Dobrushin used an induction argument to obtain uniform bounds on the partition functions and, as a consequence, analyticity properties of the system.

The proof of the convergence of cluster expansions presented in this note, and in ref. [\cite=12], is based in part on the last mentioned work. This proof is in our view rather simple and direct. The result, stated in Theorem 2, is expressed in the "classical" form, useful in the applications, that is as a bound on a sum of an absolutely convergent series. The hypothesis, the same that in [\cite=11], is slightly weaker than the hypothesis used in the mentioned previous works. We use, as in [\cite=10] and [\cite=11], the formalism of an abstract polymer system. Some recent developments of this approach can be found in ref. [\cite=13].

In the present note we follow refs.  [\cite=6] and [\cite=12]. The proofs, however, have been improved and simplified.
