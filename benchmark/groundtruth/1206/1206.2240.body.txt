Direct Detection of Dark Matter particles with Long Range Interaction

Generalization of the pointlike cross section to long-range interactions

A specific realization of long-range interactions between DM particles χ and target nuclei N is provided by models in which ordinary photons possess a kinetic mixing ε with light dark photons φ (see e.g. [\cite=FPR] [\cite=Holdom] [\cite=Foot]). In non relativistic limit this interaction is governed by a Yukawa potential V(r)  =  ε / (4π)(Ze  Zχeχ)  /  r  e- mφr, whose scale is determined by the mass of the mediator mφ.

In order to have a rough comparison with the "standard" picture (spin independent contact interaction), the differential cross section derived from the Yukawa potential above can be cast in the following form

[formula]

where σpφγ  =  μ2χp  /  π  ·  (e  ε  Zχeχ)2 / m4p is a normalized total cross section, FSI(ER) denotes the nuclear form factor and μχp is the DM-proton reduced mass. The function

[formula]

measures the deviations of the allowed regions and constraints respect to the "standard" picture. Here the factor (Z / A)2 is due to the fact that the DM only couples with protons, while the factor in the square brackets accounts for the energy dependence of the differential cross section and exhibits two limits:

Point-like limit (q  ≪  mφ): In this regime G is independent on ER, and therefore the interaction is of contact type.

Long-range limit (q  ≫  mφ); In this regime one has a E- 2R drop-off of the cross section (Rurtherford scattering). Experiments with low energy thresholds and light target mass (e.g. DAMA) are more sensitive than the ones with high threshold and heavy targets (e.g. XENON100). The compatibility among the experiments could therefore be improved.

Considering typical nuclei (mN  ~  100 GeV) and recoil energies (few keV) in the range of interest of the experiments, the transition between the two limits is obtained for mφ  ~  O(10) MeV.

Results

In the left-panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:1] we show the allowed regions and constraints coming from direct dark matter experiments, considering a dark photon mass of 30 MeV which falls in the transition between point-like and long-range interactions. One can see that:

[formula] A large overlapping between DAMA, CoGeNT and CRESST is observed at mχ  ~  10 GeV, especially in the long-range scenario (mφ  →  0). For a conservative choice of the XENON100 constraints, the overlapping regions are allowed by all the experiments.

[formula] Heavy targets (I for DAMA, W for CRESST), which account for the fit at large mχ  >  30 GeV, reach the long-range limit earlier respect to the light ones (Na for DAMA, O and Ca for CRESST). The function G gets therefore suppressed and, to yield the measured event rate, an increase in σpφγ at high mχ occurs. For this reason, the CRESST favorite region flattens respect to the point-like scenario. This also happens in DAMA, but the large 1 / E2R enhancement of the cross section close to the low energy threshold rapidly overshoots the total rate, that is treated as a constraint; therefore, getting closer to the long-range limit, the DAMA-I region disappears.

[formula] Approaching the long-range limit, the agreement among the various experiments increases, but the significance of the DAMA fit gets lower for the reason outlined in the previous item, this time applied to scattering on Na.

Constraints

In the central-panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:1] we show a first class of constraints in the (mφ,mχ) plane, coming from the fact that long-range forces rapidly overshoots the total rate being the cross section strongly enhanced. We adopt the DAMA dataset and we find that long-range forces are only viable for light DM. Nevertheless, the best agreement is obtained for mediator masses larger than 20 MeV. A 99% C.L. lower bound on mφ is about 10 MeV.

In the right-panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:1] we show instead a second class of bounds in the (ε,mφ) plane. One can see that in the "totally symmetric" case (k  =  Zχeχ  /  e  =  1), light mediators are excluded and only dark photons with mφ  >  100 MeV can satisfy the constraints and provide a suitable interpretation for DAMA and CoGeNT data. However, for k > 10 ("composite" DM models), the whole range of light-mediator masses is allowed.

Another complementary class of bounds which are dependent on Zχeχ and mφ, while independent on ε, arises from DM self-interaction. The most famous of them comes from the Bullet Cluster [\cite=Clowe], which points towards collisionless DM (σ / mχ  ≤  1.25 cm2/g). Considering mχ  ~  10 GeV (to fit direct detection observations) and again two values of the parameter k  =  1  (10), we get that the bound on the self-interaction is exceeded for mφ  <  1  (20) MeV.
