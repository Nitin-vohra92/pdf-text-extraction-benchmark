Detection Performance in Balanced Binary Relay Trees with Node and Link Failures

Introduction

Consider a distributed detection system consisting of sensors, relay nodes, and a fusion center, networked as a directed tree with sensors as leaves and fusion center as the root. The objective of the system is to jointly make a decision between two given hypotheses. Each sensor sends a message to its parent node, which could be a relay node or the fusion center. Each relay node fuses all the messages received into a new message, and then sends the new message to its parent node, which again could be a relay node or the fusion center. Ultimately, the fusion center makes an overall decision about the true hypothesis. The goal is to analyze the detection performance by investigating the scaling law of the total error probability at the fusion center, as the number N of sensors goes to infinity. This problem has been studied in the context of various architectures. What distinguishes different architectures is the configuration of relay nodes between the sensors and the fusion center, which affects the performance.

In the extensively studied parallel architecture [\cite=Tenney]-[\cite=BOOK], every sensor sends a message directly to the fusion center without any relay nodes. In this case the detection performance is the best among all architectures, and the error probability at the fusion center decays to 0 exponentially fast with respect to the number N of sensors. However, this configuration is not energy-efficient in a large-scale sensor network because sensors located far away from the fusion center have to spend more power to communicate reliably to the fusion center. The energy consumption can be largely reduced by setting up a tree architecture with intermediate relay nodes, although the detection performance in a tree architecture cannot be better than that in a parallel architecture.

The bounded-height tree architecture has been considered in [\cite=BOOK]-[\cite=BSC]. Under the Neyman-Pearson criterion, the error probability at the fusion center decays exponentially fast to 0 with the same exponent as that of a parallel architecture [\cite=tree1]. Under the Bayesian criterion, the total error probability PN at the fusion center still decays exponentially fast with respect to the number N of sensors, i.e., log P- 1N  =  Θ(N), but with an exponent that is smaller than that of the parallel configuration [\cite=tree3]. In either case, the bounded-height tree architecture does not significantly compromise the detection performance relative to the parallel configuration in terms of the exponential decay of the total error probability. Note that log  stands for binary logarithm throughout this paper.

Tree architectures with unbounded height have been considered in [\cite=Gubner]-[\cite=yash]. In particular, Gubner et al. [\cite=Gubner] consider a balanced binary relay tree of the form shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:tree]. In this configuration, the leaf nodes depicted as circles are identical sensors, which send binary messages to their parent nodes at the next level. Each node depicted as diamond is a relay node which fuses the two binary messages received from its child nodes into a new binary message and sends it upward. Ultimately, the fusion center at the root makes an overall decision. If the number of arcs in the path from a node to the nearest sensor is k, then this node is said to be at level k.

The balanced binary relay tree architecture is of interest because it is the worst-case scenario in the sense that the minimum distance from the sensors to the fusion center is the largest (the fusion center is maximally far away from the sensors). Tree networks with unbounded heights arise in a number of practical situations. Consider a wireless sensor network consisting of a large number of spatially distributed sensors. Due to limited sensing ability, we wish to aggregate the distributed information into a fusion center to jointly solve a hypothesis testing problem. Typically, each sensor has also a limited power for processing and transmitting information. As mentioned before, the energy consumption for transmitting information can be significantly reduced by setting up a tree architecture. Moreover, the assumption of unbounded heights and moderate degrees is natural for interference-limited wireless networks. In particular, systems in which a nonleaf node communicates with a significant fraction of nodes are likely to scale poorly because of interference. Another application is in social learning in multi-agent social networks, where each node represents an agent. Each agent interacts and exchanges information with its neighboring agents, and makes a decision about the underlying state of the world. Hierarchical tree architectures are common in enterprises, military hierarchies, political structures, and even online social networks. Also, it is well known that many real-life social networks are scale-free: The degree of each node is bounded with high probability. Therefore, it is of interest to consider the distributed decision making problem in tree architectures with bounded degree and hence unbound height.

We assume that the sensors are conditionally independent in this configuration, and that all nonleaf nodes use the same fusion rule: the unit-threshold likelihood-ratio test [\cite=scharf]. Under these assumptions, Gubner et al. [\cite=Gubner] show the convergence of the total error probability to 0 using Lyapunov methods. Under the same assumptions, in [\cite=Zhang] we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the total error probability at the fusion center as functions of N. These bounds reveal that the convergence of the total error probability at the fusion center is sub-exponential with exponent [formula], i.e., [formula].

The assumption in [\cite=Gubner]-[\cite=yash] is that all messages are transmitted reliably in perfect channels. However, in practical scenarios, the nodes are failure-prone and the communication channels are not perfect, wherein messages are subject to random erasures. The literature on distributed detection problem in tree networks with node and link failures is quite limited. Tay et al. [\cite=BSC] provide an asymptotic analysis of the impact of imperfect nodes and links modeled as binary symmetric channels in trees with bounded height using branching process and Chernoff bounds. However, the detection performance for unbounded-height trees with failure-prone nodes and links is still open.

In this paper, we investigate the distributed detection problem in the context of balanced binary relay trees where nodes and links fail with certain probabilities. This is the first paper on performance analysis of unbounded-height trees with imperfect nodes and links. We derive non-asymptotic bounds for the total error probability PN as functions of N. These bounds in turn characterize the asymptotic decay rate of the total error probability. Naturally, one would expect that the detection performance in the failure case cannot be better than that in the non-failure case studied in [\cite=Zhang]. But are there conditions on the failure probabilities under which the total error probability for a tree with failures decays as fast as that for the tree with no failures? We answer this question affirmatively and derive an explicit necessary and sufficient condition on the decay rate of the local failure probabilities pk (combination of node and link failure probabilities at level k) for this to happen. More specifically, the decay rate of the total error probability is still sub-exponential with the exponent [formula] in the asymptotic regime, i.e., [formula], if and only if the local failure probabilities pk satisfies log p- 1k  =  Ω(2k / 2).

Problem Formulation

We consider the problem of binary hypothesis testing between H0 and H1 in a balanced binary relay tree with failure-prone nodes and links, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:treef] (the notation there will be defined below). Each sensor (circle) sends a binary message upward to its parent node. Each relay node (diamond) fuses two binary messages from its child nodes into a new binary message, which is then sent to the node at the next level. This process is repeated culminating at the fusion center, where an overall binary decision is made. We assume that all sensors are conditionally independent given each hypothesis, and that all sensor messages have identical Type I error probability α0 (also known as probability of false alarm) and identical Type II error probability β0 (also known as probability of missed detection). Moreover, we assume that each node at level k fails with identical node failure probability nk (a failed node cannot transmit any message upward). We model each link as a binary erasure channel [\cite=TC] as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:bec]. With a certain probability, the input message X (either 0 or 1) gets erased and the receiver does not get any data. We assume that the links between nodes at height k and height k + 1 have identical probability of erasure [formula].

Suppose that a node N or a link L in the balanced binary relay tree fails. Then equivalently, we can remove the substructure below that node or link. Therefore, with a distribution given by the node and link failure probabilities, the system reduces to a random subtree of the balanced binary relay tree, which is unbalanced in general. Note that performance analysis of balanced binary relay trees with node and link failures essentially gives the expected performance for a family of random trees constructed by pruning a balanced binary relay tree.

Consider a node Nk at level k connected to its parent node Nk + 1 at level k + 1. We define several events as follows:

E(1)k: the event that the node Nk does not have a message to transmit, i.e., Nk does not receive any messages from both its child nodes. We denote the probability of this event by Pk and we call it the starvation probability.

E(2)k: the event that either the node Nk fails or the link from Nk to Nk + 1 fails. We call the occurrence of E(2)k a local failure and we denote by pk the local failure probability.

E(3)k: the event that Nk + 1 does not receive a message from Nk. We denote the probability of this event by qk and we call it the silence probability.

Note that E(3)k occurs if and only if either (i) the node Nk does not have a message to transmit (event E(1)k), or (ii) the node Nk does have a message to transmit but a local failure occurs (event E(2)k). The probability of case (i) is simply Pk. The probability of case (ii) is pk, which equals the conditional probability of E(3)k given Ē(1)k (the complement of the event E(1)k, which means that Nk has a message to transmit). Thus,

[formula]

By the law of total probability, we have

[formula]

Consider the parent node Nk + 1. This node does not have a message to transmit (event E(1)k + 1) if and only if it does not receive messages from both its two child nodes. The probability Pk + 1 of this event is

[formula]

Recursively, we can show that the probability of the event that the parent node of Nk + 1 does not receive messages from Nk + 1 is

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the local failure probability for level k + 1.

Denote the Type I and Type II error probabilities for the nodes at level k by [formula], respectively. Consider node Nk + 1 at level k + 1, which possibly receives messages from its two child nodes. We have three possible outcomes:

Nk + 1 does not receive any message from each of the two child nodes.

Nk + 1 receives a message from only one of the two child nodes.

Nk + 1 receives messages from both the two child nodes.

In case i, if Nk + 1 does not receive any message from each of the two child nodes, then Nk + 1 does not have any information for fusion. Therefore, we cannot define the Type I and II error probabilities associated with Nk + 1 in this situation. The probability of this event is q2k.

In case ii, if the parent node Nk + 1 receives data from only one of the child nodes, then the Type I and Type II error probabilities do not change since the parent node receives only one binary message and directly sends this message without fusion. The probability of this event is 2qk(1 - qk), in which case we have

[formula]

In case iii, if the parent node receives messages from both child nodes, then the scenario is the same as that in [\cite=Gubner] and [\cite=Zhang]. The probability of this event is (1 - qk)2, in which case we have

[formula]

Consider the expected Type I and Type II error probabilities conditioned on the event that the parent node receives at least one message from its child nodes (cases ii and iii), that is, given that the parent node has data. If αk  ≤  βk, then by [\eqref=eqn:1] and [\eqref=eqn:2], given that the parent node at level k + 1 has data, the expected Type I error probability after fusion is given by

[formula]

The expected Type II error probability after fusion is given by By symmetry, we can calculate the Type I and II error probabilities in the case where αk  >  βk. Note that the recursion for (αk,βk) depends on the sequence {qk}, which is given by [\eqref=eq:qq].

We can summarize the above discussion with the following recursion:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Recall that all sensors have the same error probability triplet (α0,β0,q0), where [formula]. Therefore, by the above recursion [\eqref=eqn:long], all relay nodes at level 1 will have the same error probability triplet (α1,β1,q1) = f(α0,β0,q0) (where α1 and β1 are the expected error probabilities). Similarly we can calculate error probability triplets for nodes at all other levels. We have

[formula]

where (αk,βk,qk) is the error probability triplet of nodes at the kth level of the tree.

Consider (αk,βk,qk) as a discrete dynamic system governed by [\eqref=equ:rel] with pk as its input. Notice that the dynamic system depends on the exogenous parameters nk and [formula] only through pk. An example trajectory of this dynamic system is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:plane](a), with the local failure probabilities given by pk + 1 = p2k. We observe that qk decreases very quickly to 0 in this case. In addition, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:plane](b), the trajectory approaches β  =  α at the beginning. When (αk,βk) approaches sufficiently close to the line β  =  α, the next pair (αk + 1,βk + 1) is flipped to the other side of the line β  =  α. This behavior is similar to the non-failure scenario, in which case there exists an invariant region in the sense that once the system enters the invariant region it stays in there [\cite=Zhang]. Is there an invariant region in the failure case where [formula]? We answer this question affirmatively by precisely describing this invariant region in [formula].

Our analysis builds on and further develops the method in [\cite=Zhang]. We view the local failure probability pk as an exogenous input to the dynamic system [\eqref=equ:rel]. In this case, the evolution of the dynamic system also depends on the exogenous input. In Section III, we show that the dynamic system enters and stays in an invariant region in [formula] given that pk is a non-increasing sequence. Then in Section IV, under certain conditions on the exogenous input, we derive upper and lower bounds for the ratio of the total error probabilities associated with two steps of the dynamic system, from which we derive upper and lower bounds for the total error probability at the fusion center as functions of N. These bounds in turn characterize the asymptotic decay rate of the total error probability. Last, we discuss the relationship between the decay of the exogenous input pk and the decay rate of the total error probability.

Evolution of Type I, Type II, and Silence Probabilities

Notice that the recursion ([\ref=eqn:long]) is symmetric about the hyperplanes α  +  β  =  1 and β  =  α. Thus, it suffices to study the evolution of the dynamic system only in the region bounded by α  +  β  <  1, β  ≥  α, and 0  ≤  q  ≤  1. Let

[formula]

be this triangular prism. Similarly, define the complementary triangular prism

[formula]

First, we introduce the following region:

[formula]

It is easy to show that if (αk,βk,qk)∈B, then the next triplet (αk + 1,βk + 1,qk + 1) jumps across the plane β  =  α away from (αk,βk,qk). This process is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:plane](b) from 0 to 1. More precisely, if (αk,βk,qk)∈U, then (αk,βk,qk)∈B if and only if (αk + 1,βk + 1,qk + 1)∈L. In other words, B is the inverse image of L in U under mapping f.

Note that if the initial error probability triplet is outside B, i.e., [formula], then before the system enters B, we have αk + 1  >  αk and βk + 1  <  βk. Thus, the dynamic system moves toward the β  =  α plane, which means that if the number N of sensors is sufficiently large, then the dynamic system is guaranteed to enter B.

Next we consider the behavior of the system after it enters B. If (αk,βk,qk)∈B, we consider the position of the next pair (αk + 1,βk + 1,qk + 1), i.e., we consider the image of B under f, which we denote by RL. Similarly we denote by RU the reflection of RL with respect to β  =  α. This region is shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:ru] in the (α,β,q) coordinates. We find that

[formula]

The sets RU and B have some interesting properties. We denote the projection of the upper boundary of RU and B onto the (α,β) plane for a fixed q by RqU and Bq, respectively. It is easy to see that if q1  ≤  q2, then Rq1U lies above Rq2U in the (α,β) plane. Similarly, if q1  ≤  q2, then Bq1 lies above Bq2 in the (α,β) plane. Moreover, we have the following proposition.

B  ⊂  RU.

The proof is given in Appendix A. Note that B and RU share the same lower boundary β  =  α. Thus, it suffices to prove that the upper boundary of B lies below that of RU for a fixed q, i.e., Bq lies above RqU in the (α,β) plane. The reader can refer to Figs. [\ref=fig:RU](a) and [\ref=fig:RU](b) for plots of the upper boundaries of RU and B projected onto the (α,β) plane for two fixed values of q.

Let us denote by R the region [formula]. Then, so far we have shown that if the tree height is sufficiently large the system enters R. Next we show below that R is an invariant region in the sense that once the system enters R, it stays there.

Suppose that (αk0,βk0,qk0)∈R for some k0 and the sequence {qk} is non-increasing for k  ≥  k0. Then, (αk,βk,qk)∈R for all k  ≥  k0.

To study the asymptotic detection performance, we can simply analyze the case where the system lies inside the invariant region and stays inside it. We assume that {qk} is a non-increasing sequence. We will show in the next section that without this assumption, the decay rate is strictly more slowly than that of the non-failure case. Note that {qk} is a sequence depending on the input pk, which in turn depends on the exogenous parameters nk and [formula]. Next we provide a sufficient condition for {qk} to be non-increasing.

Suppose that pk + 1  ≤  pk for all k and q1  ≤  q0. Then, {qk} is a non-increasing sequence.

Henceforth, we assume that pk is non-increasing and therefore qk is monotone non-increasing as well. Based on the above propositions, in the next section we study the reduction of the total error probability when the system lies in R to determine the asymptotic decay rate.

Error Probability Bounds and Asymptotic Decay Rates

In this section, we first compare the step-wise reduction of the total error probability between the failure case and non-failure case. Then, we show that the decay of the failure case cannot be faster than that of the non-failure case. However, we provide a sufficient condition such that the scaling law of the decay rate in the failure case remains the same as that of the non-failure case and we discuss how this sufficient condition is satisfied in terms of the input parameter pk.

Step-wise Reduction and Asymptotic Decay Rate

We will first consider the case where the prior probabilities are equal, i.e., P(H0) = P(H1) = 1 / 2. We define Lk  =  αk  +  βk to be (twice) the total error probability for nodes at level k.

Step-wise Reduction

In this part, we show that in the failure case, the decay of the total error probability for a single step cannot be faster than that of the non-failure case.

Let L(q)k + 1  =  α(q)k + 1  +  β(q)k + 1 be (twice) the total error probability at the next level from the current state (αk,βk,q). Suppose that [formula]. If q1  <  q2, then

[formula]

with equality if and only if αk  =  βk.

From Proposition [\ref=step], we immediately deduce that if q > 0, then L(0)k + 1  ≤  L(q)k + 1. This means that the decay of the total error probability for a single step is fastest if the silence probability is 0 (non-failure case). In other words, for the failure case, the step-wise shrinkage of the total error probability cannot be faster than that of the non-failure case, where the total error probability decays to 0 with exponent [formula] [\cite=Zhang]. In addition, we show in this section that the asymptotic decay rate for the failure case cannot be faster than that of the non-failure case.

Asymptotic Decay Rate

With the assumption of equally likely hypotheses, we denote (twice) the total error probability for nodes at the fusion center by PN: = Llog N. Using Proposition [\ref=step], we provide an upper bound for log P- 1N, which in turn provides an upper bound for the decay rate.

Suppose that (α0,β0,q0)∈R. Then,

[formula]

The proof is given in Appendix B. Theorem [\ref=thm:1] provides an upper bound for log P- 1N. From this upper bound, it is easy to get an upper bound for the asymptotic decay rate.

Suppose that (α0,β0,q0)∈R. Then, [formula]

Compared with the decay rate for the non-failure case, the rate in Corollary [\ref=cor:1] is not faster than [formula] (note that the scaling law for decay rate for the non-failure case is exactly [formula]). This observation is unsurprising because the case where nodes and links are perfect has the best detection performance. But is it possible that the decay rate for the failure case remains [formula]? In the next section, we show that this is possible if the silence probabilities decay to 0 sufficiently fast. We also characterize how fast the local failure probabilities need to decay to 0 such that the decay rate for the total error probability remains [formula].

Error Probability Bounds and Decay Rates

In this section, we first give a sufficient condition for the ratio Lk + 2 / L2k to be bounded. Then, we derive upper and lower bounds for the total error probability at the fusion center for trees with even and odd heights, in the equal prior scenario. Under the sufficient condition, we show that the decay rate of the total error probability remains the same as that of the non-failure case. We will also discuss the non-equal prior scenario.

Suppose that (αk,βk,qk)∈R and qk is monotone non-increasing. If there exists C  ≥  0 such that qk  ≤  CLk, then the ratio Lk + 2 / L2k is bounded as

[formula]

The proof is provided in Appendix C. The constant C in Proposition [\ref=ratio1] gives the scale relation between the silence probabilities qk and the total error probabilities Lk. Note that the upper bound of Lk + 2 / L2k in Proposition [\ref=ratio1] depends linearly on C. Therefore, the tightness of the upper and lower bounds for Lk + 2 / L2k depends on the constant C. If C = 0, then qk = 0 for all k and the problem reduces to the non-failure case, where the ratio Lk + 2 / L2k is bounded above by 2 (see [\cite=Zhang]). This represents the case where the bounds are the tightest. Figs. [\ref=fig:ratio](a) and (b) show the behavior of Lk + 2 / L2k in the regions B and [formula] for the case where C = 1, i.e., qk  ≤  Lk. This example provides a visualization of the two-step reduction of the total error probability.

Proposition [\ref=ratio1] establishes bounds on the reduction in the total error probability for every two steps. From these, we can derive bounds for log P- 1N for even-height trees, i.e., log N is even.

Suppose that (α0,β0,q0)∈R and qk is monotone non-increasing. If there exists C  ≥  0 such that qk  ≤  CLk for [formula], then for the case where log N is even,

[formula]

Again note that the tightness of the bounds in Theorem [\ref=thm:2] depends on the constant C. For example, if the silence probability qk is much smaller than Lk for all k, then C is small and the bounds are very tight.

For odd-height trees, we need to calculate the reduction in the total error probability associated with a single step. For this, we have the following proposition.

If (αk,βk,qk)∈U, then we have

[formula]

The proof is given in Appendix D. From Propositions [\ref=ratio1] and [\ref=ratio2], we give bounds for the total error probability at the fusion center for trees with odd height.

Suppose that (α0,β0,q0)∈R and qk is monotone non-increasing. If there exists C  ≥  0 such that qk  ≤  CLk for [formula], then for the case where log N is odd,

[formula]

The proof is similar to that of Theorem [\ref=thm:2] and it is provided in Appendix E.

Theorems [\ref=thm:2] and [\ref=thm:3], respectively, establish upper and lower bounds for log P- 1N for trees with even and odd heights, for the case where hypotheses H0 and H1 are equally likely. For the case where the prior probabilities are not equal, i.e., P(H0)  ≠  P(H1), we can derive bounds for the total error probability in a similar fashion. Suppose that the fusion rule is as before, i.e., the likelihood-ratio test with unit-threshold. The total error probability at the fusion center is P̂N = P(H0)αlog N + P(H1)βlog N. Without loss of generality, we assume that P(H0)  ≤  P(H1). We are interested in bounds for log P̂- 1N.

Suppose that (α0,β0,q0)∈R and qk is monotone non-increasing. If there exists C  ≥  0 such that qk  ≤  CLk for [formula], then for the case where log N is even, we have

[formula]

For the case where log N is odd, we have

[formula]

These non-asymptotic results are useful. For example, given ε∈(0,1), if we want to know how many sensors are required such that PN  ≤  ε, we can simply find the smallest N that satisfies the inequality in Theorem [\ref=thm:2], i.e.,

[formula]

Hence we have

[formula]

The growth rate for the number of sensors is Θ(( log 1  /  ε)2).

We now discuss the asymptotic decay rates. The system enters the invariant region R eventually if the height of the tree is sufficiently large. Therefore to consider the asymptotic decay rate, it suffices just to consider the decay rate when the system lies in R. In addition, the bounds in Theorems [\ref=thm:2]-[\ref=thm:4] only differ by constant terms, and so it suffices to consider only the asymptotic decay rate for trees with even height in the equal prior probability case. Moreover, when we consider the asymptotic regime, that is, N  →    ∞  , the sufficient condition in Theorems [\ref=thm:2]-[\ref=thm:4], i.e., qk  ≤  CLk, can be written as qk = O(Lk). We have the following result.

Suppose that (α0,β0,q0)∈R and qk is monotone non-increasing. If qk = O(Lk), then the asymptotic decay rate is [formula]

This implies that the decay of the total error probability is sub-exponential with exponent [formula]. Thus, compared to the non-failure case, the scaling law of the asymptotic decay rate does not change when we have node and link failures in the tree, provided that the probabilities of silence qk decay to 0 sufficiently fast such that it is dominated by Lk in the asymptotic regime.

Discussion on the Sufficient Condition

We have shown that if qk = O(Lk), then the scaling law for the asymptotic decay rate remains the same as that of the non-failure case discussed in [\cite=Zhang]. Notice that the silence probability sequence {qk} depends on the local failure probabilities {pk}, which we regard as an exogenous input. Next we consider how the decay rate of pk determines the decay rate of qk. Recall that the recursion of qk is

[formula]

Since qk is non-increasing, the first term q2k decays at least quadratically fast to 0 and [formula] in the second term. Therefore, if pk decays more slowly than quadratically, then the value of qk linearly depends on pk.

Suppose that the local failure probability sequence {pk} is non-increasing. Then, the decay rate of the total error probability remains [formula], i.e., [formula] if and only if the decay rate of pk is not smaller than 2k / 2, i.e., log p- 1k  =  Ω(2k / 2).

The above proposition tells us that the decay exponent of the total error probability remains [formula] if and only if the local failure probability decays to 0 sufficiently fast. For illustration purposes, in Figs. [\ref=fig:decay](a) and (b) we plot the total error probability PN versus the number N of sensors and log  log P- 1N versus log N, respectively. We set the prior probability P(H0) = 0.4 and the local failure probability p0 = 0.1. As shown in Figs. [\ref=fig:decay](a) and (b), the solid (black) lines represent the total error probability curves in the non-failure case. The dashed (red) lines represent the total error probability curves in the failure case where the local failure probabilities decay quadratically, i.e., pk + 1 = p2k. This corresponds to a special case where qk < Lk for sufficiently large k, for which the decay rate remains [formula]. The dotted (blue) lines represent the total error probability curves in the failure case where the local failure probabilities are identical, i.e., pk + 1 = pk. This corresponds to a case where qk  ≥  0.05 for all k, for which the decay rate is strictly smaller than [formula]. The plots are illustrative of the differences in decay rates as reflected by our analytical results.

In the non-failure case and the quadratically decaying case described above, we have [formula], which means that there exist positive constants c1 and c2 such that [formula]. Therefore, we have

[formula]

Notice that in Fig. [\ref=fig:decay](b) for sufficiently large log N (> 8), the slopes for the non-failure case and the quadratically decaying case are approximately 1/2, consistent with the bounds above.

Concluding Remarks

We have studied the detection performance of balanced binary relay trees with node and link failures. We have shown that the decay rate of the total error probability is [formula], which cannot be faster than that of the non-failure case. We have also derived upper and lower bounds for the total error probability at the fusion center as functions of N in the case where the silence probabilities decay to 0 sufficiently fast. These bounds imply that the total error probability converges to 0 sub-exponentially with exponent [formula]. Compared to balanced binary relay trees with no failures, the step-wise shrinkage of the total error probability in the failure case is slower, but the scaling law of the asymptotic decay rate remains the same. By contrast, if the silence probabilities do not decay to 0 sufficiently fast, then the decay rate in the failure case is strictly smaller than that in the non-failure case.

Future work includes a number of topics. One of them is to understand the detection performance for other architectures with node and link failures, including M-ary relay trees [\cite=Zhang4] and tandem networks [\cite=Tang]-[\cite=venu]. For example, in general tree structures, if each node has degree more than 2, then the system is more robust to node and link failures than binary trees. Moreover, we expect that our techniques can be used to characterize the relationship between the decay rate of the local failure probability and the decay rate of the total error probability.

Our assumption that the sensors make (conditionally) independent observations is restrictive and will often be violated. The correlated sensor scenario has been investigated in the parallel configuration [\cite=Ve]-[\cite=Hao1]. The case of correlated sensor observations in tree networks is still open. In this paper, we have modeled the failure-prone links by binary erasure channels. Some other interesting models considered only in the parallel configuration include binary symmetric channels, Rayleigh fading channels [\cite=Fade], and fading multiple-access channels [\cite=Fadi1],[\cite=Fadi]. Other than the node and link failures considered in this paper, it would be of interest to characterize the impact of malicious byzantine nodes [\cite=tong], which intentionally report false information upward in the tree network.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:1]

B and RU share the same lower boundary β  =  α. Thus, it suffices to prove that the upper boundary of B lies below that of RU for a fixed q, i.e., Bq lies above RqU in the (α,β) plane.

The upper boundary of B is given by

The upper boundary of RU is given by

We need to prove the following:

which can be simplified as follows:

Fortuitously, the left-hand side turns out to be identically 0. Thus, the inequality holds.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]

From the assumptions that qk is monotone non-increasing and (α0,β0,q0)∈R, we shall see that the dynamic system stays inside R. First we show the following inequality:

[formula]

The evolution of the system is

[formula]

From Proposition [\ref=step], we have L(0)k + 2  ≤  Lk + 2, where L(0)k + 2 = 2αk + 1  -  α2k + 1  +  β2k + 1 as defined before. To prove Lk + 2 / L2k  ≥  1 / 2, it suffices to show that L(0)k + 2 / L2k  ≥  1 / 2. We divide our proof into two cases: [formula] and (αk,βk,qk)∈B.

Case I. If [formula], then

[formula]

From the recursion [\eqref=eqn:long], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, it suffices to show that

[formula]

It is easy to see that 2(2αk  -  α2k)  ≥  1 - (1 - αk)4. Hence, it suffices to show that

[formula]

which has been proved in [\cite=Zhang].

Case II. If (αk,βk,qk)∈B, then it suffices to show that

[formula]

Again from [\eqref=eqn:long], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Thus, it suffices to prove that

[formula]

which is obvious. This proves [\eqref=b1]. We now prove the claim of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]. From [\eqref=b1], we have Lk + 2 = akL2k for [formula] and some ak  ≥  1 / 2. Therefore, for [formula], we have

[formula]

where ai  ≥  1 / 2, [formula]. Taking log s and using k =  log N, we have

[formula]

Notice that log L- 10 > 0 and log ai  ≥   - 1 for all i. Thus,

[formula]

Proof of Proposition [\ref=ratio1]

The lower bound of Lk + 2 / L2k has been proved in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:1]. Here we derive the upper bound for Lk + 2 / L2k. Again we divide our proof into two cases: [formula] and (αk,βk,qk)∈B.

Case I. If [formula], then

[formula]

Since qk  ≤  CLk, the second term on the right-hand side of [\eqref=eqn:thm2] is upper bounded as

[formula]

We now show the other term is bounded above, namely,

[formula]

Let φ(αk,βk): = 2αk - (4C + 3)α2k - (4C + 1)β2k - 2(4C + 2)αkβk  ≤  0. We have

[formula]

Thus, the maximum of φ is on the line αk  +  βk = qk / C and the upper boundary of B. If αk  +  βk = qk / C, then we have

[formula]

The partial derivative of the above term with respect to βk is non-positive. Therefore, the maximum lies on the intersection of αk  +  βk = qk / C and the upper boundary of B. Hence, it suffices to show [\eqref=c2] on the upper boundary of B, which is given by

[formula]

Let [formula]. We have

[formula]

Since qk  ≤  C(αk  +  βk) and φ(αk,βk) is non-positive. This proves [\eqref=c2]. Moreover, we have (1 - qk) / (1 + qk)  ≤  1, which combined with [\eqref=c2], gives

[formula]

Thus, we have Lk + 2  /  L2k  ≤  6C + 2.

Case II. We now show that Lk + 2 / L2k  ≤  6C + 2 for the case where (αk,βk,qk)∈B, From Proposition [\ref=step] we have L(qk)k + 2  ≥  Lk + 2, where L(qk)k + 2 denotes the total error probability if we use qk to calculate Lk + 2 from Lk + 1. Therefore, it suffices to prove that

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Since qk  ≤  CLk, we have βk  ≥  qk / (2C) and

[formula]

From recursion [\eqref=eqn:long], we have

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

We can consider the line αk  +  βk = qk / C and the lower boundary of B, which is given by βk  =  αk. With a similar argument, the maximum can be shown to lies on the intersection of αk  +  βk = qk / C and the lower boundary of B. Moreover, we know that if βk  =  αk, then Lk + 1 = Lk and (αk + 1,βk + 1) lies on the lower boundary of RL. Following a similar argument to Case I, we arrive at Lk + 2 / L2k = Lk + 2 / L2k + 1  ≤  6C + 2.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=ratio2]

To prove [formula], it suffices to show that

[formula]

Note that the second term on the right-hand side of [\eqref=eqn:prf] is non-negative. The first term can be written as

[formula]

which is also positive.

To prove [formula], it suffices to show that

[formula]

which is easy to see because the first term is non-positive.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:3]

From Proposition [\ref=ratio2], we have [formula] for some [formula]. And, by Proposition [\ref=ratio1], the following identity holds: Lk + 2 = akL2k for [formula] and some ak∈[1  /  2,6C  +  2]. Hence, we can write

[formula]

where ai∈[1  /  2,6C  +  2] for each [formula], and [formula]. Taking log s and using k =  log N, we have

[formula]

Notice that log L- 10 > 0 and log ai  ≥   - 1 for all i. Moreover, [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

We now establish the lower bound. It follows from Proposition [\ref=ratio2] that [formula] for some [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=ratio1], we have Lk + 2 = akL2k for [formula] and some ak∈[1  /  2,6C  +  2]. Thus,

[formula]

where ai∈[1  /  2,6C  +  2] for each [formula], and [formula]. Hence,

[formula]

Notice that log L- 10 > 0 and - 1  ≤   log ai  ≤   log (6C + 2) for all i, and [formula]. Thus,

[formula]
