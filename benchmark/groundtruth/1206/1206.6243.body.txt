Primitive disk complexes for lens spaces

Introduction

Every closed orientable 3-manifold can be decomposed into two handlebodies of the same genus, which is called a Heegaard splitting of the manifold. The genus of the handlebodies is called the genus of the splitting. The 3-sphere admits a Heegaard splitting of each genus g  ≥  0, and a lens space a Heegaard splitting of each genus g  ≥  1. Furthermore, they are known to have a unique Heegaard splitting up to isotopy for each genus.

There is a well known simplicial complex, called the disk complex, for a handlebody, in general for an arbitrary irreducible 3-manifold with compressible boundary. The disk complex is not only a powerful tool when we study the mapping class group of a manifold, but already an interesting topological object by itself. For a Heegaard splitting of a manifold, one can define a special subcomplex of the disk complex for one of the handlebodies in the splitting, which is invariant under any automorphism of the manifold preserving the given splitting. In particular, when a given splitting is stabilized, we define a natural subcomplex of the disk complex for one of the handlebodies, which is called the primitive disk complex. The primitive disk complex is the full subcomplex spanned by special kind of vertices, the vertices of primitive disks in the handlebody.

The group of automorphisms preserving a given splitting of genus g is called the genus g Goeritz group of the splitting. Investigating the action of the Goeritz group on an appropriate subcomplex, one might have a useful information on this group. For example, in [\cite=C] and [\cite=C2], the primitive disk complex for the genus two Heegaard splitting for each of the 3-sphere and the lens spaces L(p,1) is studied to obtain a finite presentation of the genus two Goeritz group of the splitting. The study of the primitive disk complexes was motivated by Scharlemann's work [\cite=Sc] on the complex of reducing spheres for the genus two splitting of the 3-sphere, which was analyzed further by Akbas [\cite=Ak]. A generalized version of a primitive disk complex is also studied in [\cite=Kod] for the group of automorphisms of the 3-sphere preserving a genus two handlebody knot embedded in the 3-sphere.

In this work, we are interested in the primitive disk complex for the genus two Heegaard splitting of each lens space L(p,q). The main results are Theorems [\ref=thm:contractible] and [\ref=thm:structure]. In Theorem [\ref=thm:contractible], we find all lens spaces whose primitive disk complexes for their genus two splittings are contractible. It states that, for a lens space L(p,q) with 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, the primitive disk complex for the genus two splitting of L(p,q) is contractible if and only if [formula]. In Theorem [\ref=thm:structure], we give a complete combinatorial structure of the primitive disk complex for each lens space, and describe how each of the complexes sits in the ambient disk complex for the genus two handlebody. In particular, a contractible primitive disk complex is two dimensional if and only if q = 2 or p = 2q + 1, and otherwise it is a tree. Any non-contractible primitive disk complex turns out to be not connected and consists of infinitely but countably many tree components.

In the follow-up work [\cite=CKod], the results on the primitive disk complexes we obtained here will be fully used to find a presentation of the genus two Goeritz group of each lens space L(p,q), including the special case of L(p,1) done in [\cite=C2].

We use the standard notation L  =  L(p,q) for a lens space in standard textbooks. For example, we refer [\cite=Ro] to the reader. That is, there is a genus one Heegaard splitting of L such that an oriented meridian circle of a solid torus of the splitting is identified with a (p,q)-curve on the boundary torus of the other solid torus (fixing oriented longitude and meridian circles of the torus), where π1(L(p,q)) is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order |p|. The integer p can be assumed to be positive, and it is well known that two lens spaces L(p,q) and L(p',q') are homeomorphic if and only if p  =  p' and [formula]. Thus we will assume that 0  <  q  <  p for a given L(p,q), or even that 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2 sometimes. Further, there is a unique integer q' satisfying 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2 and [formula], and so, for any other genus one Heegaard splitting of L(p,q), we may assume that an oriented meridian circle of a solid torus of the splitting is identified with a (p,)-curve on the boundary torus of the other solid torus for some ∈{q,q',p - q',p - q}.

Throughout the paper, (V,W;Σ) will denote a genus two Heegaard splitting of a lens space L  =  L(p,q). That is, V and W are genus two handlebodies such that [formula] and [formula], a genus two closed orientable surface in L. Any disks in a handlebody are always assumed to be properly embedded, and their intersection is transverse and minimal up to isotopy. In particular, if a disk D intersects a disk E, then [formula] is a collection of pairwise disjoint arcs that are properly embedded in both D and E. Finally, [formula] will denote a regular neighborhood of X and [formula] the closure of X for a subspace X of a polyhedral space, where the ambient space will always be clear from the context.

Primitive elements of the free group of rank two

The fundamental group of the genus two handlebody is the free group [formula] of rank two. We call an element of [formula] primitive if it is a member of a generating pair of [formula]. Primitive elements of [formula] have been well understood. For example, given a generating pair {y,z} of [formula], a cyclically reduced form of any primitive element w can be written as a product of terms each of the form yεzn or yεzn + 1, or else a product of terms each of the form zεyn or zεyn + 1, for some ε∈{1, - 1} and some [formula]. Consequently, no cyclically reduced form of w in terms of y and z can contain y and y- 1 (and z and z- 1) simultaneously. Furthermore, we have the explicit characterization of primitive elements containing only positive powers of y and z as follows, which is given in [\cite=OZ].

Suppose that w consists of exactly m z's and n y's where 1  ≤  m  ≤  n. Then w is primitive if and only if (m,n)  =  1 and w has the following cyclically reduced form

[formula]

where the function [formula] is defined by

[formula]

For example, w(3,5)  =  zy2zy2zy and w(3,10)  =  zy4zy3zy3. One can write the word w(m,n) quickly using consecutive m black points for z's and n white points for y's on a circle. Starting at the first black one, move to the m-th point in the clockwise direction and so on. And then after m + n - 1 moves, we have w(m,n) (see Figure [\ref=primitive] (a)).

Let {z,y} be a generating pair of the free group of rank two. Given relatively prime integers p and q with 0  <  q < p, we define a sequence of (p + 1) elements [formula] in term of z and w as follows.

Define first w0 to be yp. For each [formula], let [formula] be the function given by

[formula]

and then define [formula]. Each of wj has length p and consists of j z's and (p - j) y's. In particular, w1  =  zyp - 1, wp - 1  =  zp - qyzq - 1 and wp  =  zp. We call the sequence [formula] the (p,q)-sequence of the pair (z,y). An easy way to write down the word wj is to put p white points on a circle, and then change one to a black point, and change the q-th white one to black in clockwise direction and so one. Each black is z and white y, and after j changes, we have wj (see Figure [\ref=primitive] (b), w3 in (8,3)-sequence). For example, the (8,3)-sequence is given by Observe that wp - j is a cyclic permutation of [formula] for each j, where ψ is the automorphism exchanging z and y, and [formula] is the reverse of w. Thus wj is primitive if and only if wp - j is primitive. We can find all primitive elements in the sequence as follows.

Let [formula] be the (p,q)-sequence of the generating pair {z,y} with 0 < q  <  p. Let q' be the unique integer satisfying 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2 with [formula]. Then wj is primitive if and only if j∈{1,q',p - q',p - 1}.

It is clear that w1 and wp - 1 are primitive while w0 and wp are not.

Claim 1. wq' is primitive. Proof of Claim 1. We write [formula], and [formula] where g  =  gq',p - q' in the notation in Lemma [\ref=lem:primitive]. Since f(i)  =  z if and only if [formula] for some [formula], it can be directly verified that

[formula]

Thus wq' is w(q',p - q') itself if [formula] or is a cyclic permutation of it if [formula]. In either cases, wq' is primitive.

Claim 2. If 1  <  j  ≤  p / 2 and j  ≠  q', then wj is not primitive. Proof of Claim 2. From the assumption, there is a unique integer r satisfying 2  ≤  r  ≤  p - 2 and [formula]. Suppose, for contradiction, that wj is primitive. Then, by Lemma [\ref=lem:primitive], (p,j)  =  1 and wj is a cyclic permutation of w(j,p - j). We write [formula] and [formula] where g  =  gj,p - j as in Lemma [\ref=lem:primitive]. Then there is a constant k such that fj(i)  =  g(1 + (i - 1 + k)j) for all [formula]. In particular, fj(1  +  nq)  =  z  =  g(1 + (nq  +  k)j) for each [formula].

From the definition of g  =  gj,p - j and the choice of the integer r, we have [formula]. Let an be the unique integer satisfying [formula] with [formula] for each [formula]. Observe that [formula] for each [formula], and in particular, [formula]. Since 1  ≤  a0  ≤  j  <  p and 2  ≤  r  ≤  p - 2  <  p, we have only two possibilities: either a0  +  r  =  a1 or a0  +  r  =  a1  +  p.

First consider the case a0  +  r  =  a1. Then r  ≤  j - 1 and an  <  an + 1, consequently [formula], which implies r = 1, a contradiction. Next, if a0  +  r  =  a1  +  p, then p + 1 - j  ≤  r and an  >  an + 1, thus we have [formula], and consequently r  =  p - 1, a contradiction again.

By the claims, if 1  ≤  j  ≤  p / 2, then wj is primitive only when j = 1 or j = q'. If p / 2  ≤  j  ≤  p, due to the fact that wp - j is a cyclic permutation of [formula], the only primitive elements are wp - q' and wp - 1, which completes the proof.

A simple closed curve in the boundary of a genus two handlebody W represents elements of [formula]. We call a pair of essential disks in W a complete meridian system for W if the union of the two disks cuts off W into a 3-ball. Given a complete meridian system {D,E}, assign symbols x and y to the circles ∂D and ∂E respectively. Suppose that an oriented simple closed curve l on ∂W that meets [formula] transversely and minimally. Then l determines a word in terms of x and y which can be read off from the the intersections of l with ∂D and ∂E (after a choice of orientations of ∂D and ∂E), and hence l represents an element of the free group [formula].

In this set up, the following is a simple criterion for the primitiveness of the elements represented by such simple closed curves.

With a suitable choice of orientations of ∂D and ∂E, if a word corresponding to a simple closed curve l contains one of the pairs of terms: (1) both of xy and xy- 1 or (2) both of xynx and yn + 2 for n  ≥  0, then the element of π1(W) represented by l cannot be (a positive power of ) a primitive element.

Let Σ' be the 4-holed sphere cut off from ∂W along [formula]. Denote by d+ and d- (by e+ and e- respectively) the boundary circles of Σ' that came from ∂D (from ∂E respectively).

Suppose first that l represents an element of a form containing both xy and xy- 1. Then we may assume that there are two subarcs l+ and l- of [formula] such that l+ connects d+ and e+, and l- connects d+ and e- as in Figure [\ref=not_primitive]. Since [formula] and [formula], we must have two other arcs m+ and m- of [formula] such that m+ connects d- and e+, and m- connects d- and e-.

Consequently, there exists no arc component of [formula] that meets only one of d+, d-, e+ and e-. That is, any word corresponding to l contains neither [formula] nor [formula], and hence it is cyclically reduced. Considering all possible directions of the arcs l+, l-, m+ and m-, each word represented by l must contain both x and x- 1 (or both y and y - 1), which means that l cannot represent (a positive power of) a primitive element of π1(W).

Next, suppose that a word corresponding to l contains x2 and y2, which is the case of n = 0 in the second condition. Then there are two arcs l+ and l- of [formula] such that l+ connects d+ and d-, and l- connects e+ and e-. By a similar argument to the above, we see again that any word corresponding to l is cyclically reduced, but contains both of x2 and y2. Thus l cannot represent (a positive power of) a primitive element.

Suppose that a word corresponding to l contains xynx and yn + 2 for n  ≥  1. Then there are two subarcs α and β of l which correspond to xynx and yn + 2 respectively. In particular, we may assume that α starts at d+, intersects ∂E in n points, and ends in d-, while β starts at e+, intersects ∂E in its interior in n points, and ends in e-.

Let m be the subarc of α corresponding to xy. Then m connects two circles d+ and one of e±, say e+. Choose a disk [formula] properly embedded in the 3-ball W cut off by [formula] such that the boundary circle [formula] is the frontier of a regular neighborhood of [formula] in Σ'. Then [formula] is a non-separating disk in W and forms a complete meridian system with D. Assigning the same symbol y to [formula], the arc α determines xyn - 1x while β determines yn + 1. Thus the conclusion follows by induction.

Primitive disks in a handlebody

Recall that (V,W;Σ) denotes a genus two Heegaard splitting of a lens space L  =  L(p,q) with 0  <  q  <  p. An essential disk E in V is called primitive if there exists an essential disk E' in W such that ∂E intersects ∂E' transversely in a single point. Such a disk E' is called a dual disk of E, which is also primitive in W having a dual disk E. Note that both [formula] and [formula] are solid tori. Primitive disks are necessarily non-separating. We call a pair of disjoint, non-isotopic primitive disks in V a primitive pair in V. Similarly, a triple of pairwise disjoint, non-isotopic primitive disks is a primitive triple.

A non-separating disk E0 properly embedded in V is called semiprimitive if there is a primitive disk E' in W disjoint from E0. The boundary circle ∂E0 can be considered as a (p,)-curve on the boundary of the solid torus W cut off by E' for some integer [formula] satisfying the relation [formula].

Any simple closed curve on the boundary of the solid torus W represents an element of π1(W) which is the free group of rank two. We interpret primitive disks algebraically as follows, which is a direct consequence of [\cite=Go].

Let D be a non-separating disk in V. Then D is primitive if and only if ∂D represents a primitive element of π1(W).

Note that no disk can be both primitive and semiprimitive since the boundary circle of a semiprimitive disk in V represents the p-th power of a primitive element of π1(W).

Let D and E be essential disks in V, and suppose that D intersects E transversely and minimally. Let C  ⊂  D be a disk cut off from D by an outermost arc α of [formula] in D such that [formula]. We call such a C an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula]. The arc α cuts E into two disks, say G and H. Then we have two disjoint disks E1 and E2 which are isotopic to disks [formula] and [formula] respectively. We call E1 and E2 the disks from surgery on E along the outermost subdisk C of D.

Since E and D are assumed to intersect minimally, E1 (and E2) is isotopic to neither E nor D. Also both of E1 and E2 are non-separating if D is non-separating. Observe that each of E1 and E2 has fewer arcs of intersection with D than E had since at least the arc α no longer counts.

For an essential disk D in V intersecting transversely and minimally the union of two disjoint essential disks E and F, we define similarly the disks from surgery on [formula] along an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula]. In this case, if D is non-separating and {E,F} is a complete meridian system of V, then one of the two disks is isotopic to E or F and the other one to neither of E and F.

Let {D,E} be a primitive pair of V. Then D and E have a common dual disk if and only if there is a semiprimitive disk E0 in V disjoint from D and E.

The necessity is clear. For sufficiency, let E' be a primitive disk in W disjoint from the semiprimitive disk E0 in V. It is enough to show that E' is a dual disk of every primitive disk in V disjoint from E0, since then E' would be a common dual disk of D and E.

Claim: If E is a primitive disk in V dual to E', then E is disjoint from E0.

Proof of claim. Denote by E+0 and E-0 the two disks on the boundary of the solid torus V cut off by E0 that came from E0. Suppose that E intersects E0. Then an outermost subdisk C of E cut off by [formula] must intersect ∂E' since ∂E' is a longitude of the solid torus V cut off by E0. We may assume that C is incident to E+0. Considering [formula], there is a subarc of ∂E whose two endpoints lie in ∂E-0, which also intersects ∂E', and hence ∂E intersects ∂E' at least in two points, a contradiction.

Let D be a primitive disk in V disjoint from E0. Among all the primitive disks in V dual to E', choose one, denoted by E again, such that [formula] is minimal. By the claim, E is disjoint from E0. Let E'0 be the unique semiprimitive disk in W disjoint from [formula]. Since {E',E'0} forms a complete meridian system of W, by assigning symbols x and y to oriented ∂E' and ∂E'0 respectively, any oriented simple closed curve on ∂W represents an element of the free group π1(W)  =  〈x,y〉 as in the previous section. In particular, we may assume that ∂E and ∂E0 represents elements of the form x and yp respectively.

Denote by Σ0 the 4-holed sphere ∂V cut off by [formula]. Consider Σ0 as a 2-holed annulus with two boundary circles ∂E±0 came from ∂E0 and with two holes ∂E± came from ∂E. Then ∂E'0 is the union of p spanning arcs in Σ0 which divides Σ0 into p rectangles, and the two holes ∂E± is contained in a single rectangle. Notice that ∂E' is an arc in the rectangle connecting the two holes. See Figure [\ref=Sigma_0] (a).

Suppose that D is disjoint from E. Then D is a non-separating disk in V disjoint from [formula], and hence the boundary circle ∂D can be considered as the frontier of a regular neighborhood in Σ0 of the union of one of the two boundary circles, one of the two holes of Σ0, and an arc α connecting them. The arc α cannot intersect ∂E'0 in Σ0, otherwise an element represented by ∂D must contain both of xy and xy- 1 (after changing orientations if necessary), which contradicts that D is primitive by Lemma [\ref=lem:key] (see Figure [\ref=Sigma_0] (b)). Thus α is disjoint from ∂E'0, and consequently D intersects ∂E' in a single point. That is, E' is a dual disk of D (see Figure [\ref=Sigma_0] (a)).

Suppose next that D intersects E. Let C be an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula]. Then one of the resulting disks from surgery on E along C is E0 and the other one, say E', is isotopic to none of E and E0. The arc [formula] can be considered as the frontier of a regular neighborhood of the union of a boundary circle of Σ0 came from ∂E0 and an arc, denoted by α0, connecting this circle and a hole came from ∂E. By a similar argument to the above, one can show that α0 is disjoint from ∂E'0, otherwise D would not be primitive. Consequently, the boundary circle of the resulting disk E1 from the surgery intersects ∂E' in a single point, which means E1 is primitive with the dual disk E'. But we have [formula] from the surgery construction, which contradicts the minimality of [formula].

In the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:common_dual], if we assume that the primitive disk D also intersects E0, then the subdisk C of D cut off by [formula] would be incident to one of E and E0. The argument to show that the resulting disk E1 from the surgery is primitive with the dual disk E' still holds when C is incident to E0 and even when D is semiprimitive. This observation suggests the following lemma.

Let E0 be a semiprimitive disk in V and let E be a primitive disk in V disjoint from E0. If a primitive or semiprimitive disk D in V intersects [formula], then one of the disks from surgery on [formula] along an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula] is either E or E0, and the other one, say E1, is a primitive disk, which has a common dual disk with E.

A sequence of disks generated by a dual pair

In this section, we introduce a special sequence of disks in the handlebody V, which will play a key role in the following sections. Again, we have a genus two Heegaard splitting (V,W;Σ) of a lens space L  =  L(p,q) with 0  <  q  <  p. Let E be a primitive disk in V with a dual disk E', and let E0 and E'0 be the unique semiprimitive disks in V and W respectively which are disjoint from [formula]. We will assume that ∂E'0 is a (p,q)-curve on the boundary of the solid torus [formula] with 0  <  q  <  p.

Assigning symbols x and y to oriented ∂E' and ∂E'0 respectively as in the previous sections, any oriented simple closed curve on ∂W represents an element of the free group π1(W)  =  〈x,y〉. We simply denote the circles ∂E' and ∂E'0 by x and y respectively. The circle y is disjoint from ∂E and intersects ∂E0 in p points, and x is disjoint from ∂E0 and intersects ∂E in a single point. Thus we may assume that ∂E0 and ∂E determine the elements of the form yp and x respectively.

Let Σ0 be the 4-holed sphere ∂V cut off by [formula]. Denote by e± the boundary circles of Σ0 came from ∂E and similarly e±0 came from ∂E0. The 4-holed sphere Σ0 can be regarded as a 2-holed annulus where the two boundary circles are e±0 and the two holes e±. Then the circle y in Σ0 is the union of p spanning arcs which cuts the annulus into p rectangles, and x is a single arc connecting two holes e±, where [formula] is contained in a single rectangle (see the surface Σ0 in Figure [\ref=sequence]).

Any non-separating disk in V disjoint from [formula] and not isotopic to either of E and E0 is determined by an arc properly embedded in Σ0 connecting one of e± and one of e±0. That is, the boundary circle of such a disk is the frontier of a regular neighborhood of the union of the arc and the two circles connected by the arc in Σ0. Choose such an arc α0 so that α0 is disjoint from y, and denote by E1 the non-separating disk determined by α0. Observe that there are infinitely many choices of such arcs up to isotopy, and so are the disks E1, but the element represented by ∂E1 has one of the forms x±  1y±  p, so we may assume that ∂E1 represents xyp by changing the orientations if necessary.

Next, let Σ1 be the 4-holed sphere ∂V cut off by [formula]. As in the case of Σ0, consider Σ1 as a 2-holed annulus with boundaries e±1 and with two holes e± where e±1 came from ∂E1. Then the circle y cuts off Σ1 into p rectangles as in the case of Σ0, but two holes e+ and e- are now contained in different rectangles. In particular, we can give labels [formula] to the rectangles consecutively so that e+ lies in the rectangle labeled by 0 while e- in that by q. The circle x in Σ1 is the union of two arcs connecting e±1 and e± contained in the rectangles labeled by 0 and p respectively.

Now consider a properly embedded arc in Σ1 connecting one of e± and one of e±1. Choose such an arc α1 so that α1 is disjoint from y and parallel to none of the two arcs of [formula]. Then α1 determines a non-separating disk, denoted by E2, whose boundary circle is the frontier of a regular neighborhood of the union of α1 and the two circles connected by α1. (If α1 is isotopic to one of the two arcs [formula], then the resulting disk is E0.) Observe that ∂E2 represents an element of the form xyqxyp - q (see the surface Σ1 in Figure [\ref=sequence]).

We continue this process in the same way. Then Σ2 is the 4-holed sphere ∂V cut off by [formula], and we choose an arc α2 in Σ2 disjoint from y and parallel to none of the arcs [formula], which determines the disk E3. The boundary circle ∂E3 represents an element of the form xyqxyqxyp - 2q if 0  <  q  ≤  p / 2 or xy2q - pxyp - qxyp - q if p / 2 < q < p. In general, we have a non-separating disk Ej whose boundary circle lies in the 4-holed sphere Σj - 1.

We finish the process in the p-th step to have the disk Ep whose boundary circle lies in Σp - 1. The disk Ep - 1 and Ep represent elements of the form (xy)p - qy(xy)q - 1 and (xy)p respectively. Observe that there are infinitely many choices of the arc α0, and so choices of the disk E1 as we have seen, but once E1 have been chosen, the next disks Ej for each [formula] are uniquely determined. We call the sequence of the disks [formula] in V a sequence of disks generated by the dual pair {E,E'}.

Note that Ej is disjoint from Ej + 1, and intersects Ej + 2 in a single arc for each [formula]. For example, see ∂E0, ∂E2 and ∂E1 (=  e±1) in Σ1 in Figure [\ref=sequence]. In general, we have [formula] for 0  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  p. This is obvious from the construction. Figure [\ref=intersection] illustrates intersections of Ej with Ej + 2, Ej + 3 and Ej + 4 in the 3-balls V cut off by [formula], [formula] and [formula] respectively.

Let [formula] be a sequence of disks in V generated by a dual pair {E,E'}. Then we have

E0 and Ep are semiprimitive.

Ej is primitive if and only if j∈{1,q',p - q',p - 1} where q' is the unique integer satisfying [formula] and 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2.

(1) E0 is a semiprimitive disk disjoint from E' from the construction. For the disk Ep, it is easy to find a circle e'' in Σ such that [formula] is an arc which connects the two holes e+ and e- and is disjoint from [formula] (see the arc e'' in the surface Σ5 in Figure [\ref=sequence]). Cutting W along [formula], we have a 3-ball B, and the circle e'' lies in ∂B. Thus e'' bounds a disk E'' in W which is primitive since e'' intersects ∂E in a single point. The disk Ep is disjoint from E'' and so is semiprimitive.

(2) From the construction, each circle ∂Ej represents the element wj in the (p,q)-sequence in section [\ref=sec:free_group], by the substitution of z for xy. Thus the conclusion follows by Lemma [\ref=lem:four_primitives] with Lemma [\ref=lem:primitive_element].

The following is a kind of generalization of Lemma [\ref=lem:first_surgery] into the case of the sequence of disks generated by a dual pair.

Let [formula] be a sequence of disks in V generated by a dual pair {E,E'} where E is in V, and let D be a primitive or semiprimitive disk in V. For [formula],

if D is disjoint from [formula] and is isotopic to none of E and Ej, then D is isotopic to either Ej - 1 or Ej + 1, and

if D intersects [formula], then one of the disks from surgery on [formula] along an outermost subdisk C of D cut off by [formula] is either E or Ej, and the other one is either Ej - 1 or Ej + 1.

Suppose that D is disjoint from [formula]. The boundary circle ∂D lies in the 2-holed annulus Σj. Thus ∂D can be considered as the frontier of the union of one hole and one boundary circle of Σj, and an arc αj connecting them. By the same argument for the proof of Lemmas [\ref=lem:common_dual] and [\ref=lem:first_surgery], the arc αj cannot intersect the arcs of [formula] otherwise D would not be (semi)primitive. Thus the disk D must be either Ej - 1 or Ej + 1. (Note that if both of Ej - 1 and Ej + 1 are not primitive, then we can say that such a primitive disk D does not exist.) The second statement can be proved in the same manner by considering the arc [formula] for the outermost subdisk C of D.

Disks obtained from surgery on a primitive disk

In this section, we develop several properties of primitive disks, pairs and triples. Here we will assume that 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2 for a given lens space L(p,q) with a genus two Heegaard splitting (V,W;Σ).

Given a lens space L(p,q) with 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, suppose that [formula]. Let D and E be primitive disks in V which intersect each other transversely and minimally. Then at least one of the two disks from surgery on E along an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula] is primitive.

Let C be an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula]. The choice of a dual disk E' of E determines a unique semiprimitive disk E0 in V which is disjoint from [formula]. Among all the dual disks of E, choose one, denoted by E' again, so that the resulting semiprimitive disk E0 intersects C minimally. If C is disjoint from E0, then, by Lemma [\ref=lem:first_surgery], the disk from surgery on E along C other than E0 is primitive, having the common dual disk E' with E, and so we are done.

From now on, we assume that C intersects E0. Then one of the disks from surgery on E0 along an outermost subdisk C0 of C cut off by [formula] is E, and the other one, say E1, is primitive having the common dual disk E' with E, by Lemma [\ref=lem:first_surgery] again. Then we have the sequence [formula] of disks generated by the dual pair {E,E'} starting with the disks E0 and E1. Let E'0 be the unique semiprimitive disk in W disjoint from [formula]. The circle ∂E'0 would be a (p,)-curve on the boundary of the solid torus [formula] for some ∈{q,q',p - q',p - q}, where q' satisfies 0  <  q'  <  p and [formula]. We will consider only the case of   =  q, and so ∂E'0 is a (p,q)-curve again. The proof is easily adapted for the other cases.

If C intersects E1, then one of the disks from surgery on E1 along an outermost subdisk C1 of C cut off by [formula] is E, and the other one is either E0 or E2 by Lemma [\ref=lem:surgery_on_primitive], but it is actually E2 since we have [formula] from the surgery construction. In general, if C intersects each of [formula], for [formula], the disk from surgery on Ej by an outermost subdisk Cj of C cut off by [formula], other than E, is Ej + 1, and we have [formula]. Consequently, we see that [formula], but it contradicts the minimality of [formula] since Ep is also a semiprimitive disk disjoint from E. Thus, there is a disk Ej for some [formula] which is disjoint from C.

Now, denote by Ej again the first disk in the sequence that is disjoint from C. Then the two disks from surgery on E along C are Ej and Ej + 1, hence C is also disjoint from Ej + 1. Actually they are the only disks in the sequence disjoint from C. For other disks in the sequence, it is easy to see that [formula] (by a similar observation to the fact that [formula] for 0  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  p in the sequence of disks). If j  ≥  p / 2, then we have [formula], a contradiction for the minimality condition again. Thus, Ej is one of the disks in the first half of the sequence, that is, 1  ≤  j  <  p / 2.

Claim. The disk Ej is one of E1, Eq' - 1 or Eq', where q' is the unique integer satisfying 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2 and [formula].

Proof of Claim. We have assumed that [formula] with 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, and so q'  =  1 if q  =  1, and p = qq'  +  1 if q = 2, and p  =  qq'  ±  1 if q  ≥  3. Assigning symbols x and y to oriented ∂E' and ∂E0' respectively, ∂Eq' may represent the primitive element of the form [formula] if q  ≥  2 or xyp if q  =  1. In general, ∂Ek represents an element of the form [formula] for some positive integers [formula] with [formula] for each [formula]. Furthermore, since C is disjoint from Ej and Ej + 1, the word determined by the arc [formula] is of the form [formula] (or its reverse) when ∂Ej + 1 represents an element of the form [formula].

If 2  ≤  j  ≤  q' - 2, then an element represented by ∂Ej + 1 has the form [formula], and so an element represented by ∂D contains xyqx and yp - jq, which lies in the part [formula] of ∂D. We have q'  ≥  4 in this case, and so q  ≥  2. Thus p - jq  =  qq'  ±  1  -  jq  ≥  q + 2. By Lemma [\ref=lem:key], the disk D cannot be primitive, a contradiction.

Suppose that q'  <  j < p / 2. First, observe that ∂Eq' + 1 represents an element of the form [formula] if p  =  qq' + 1 or [formula] if p = qq' - 1. Also a word represented by ∂Ej + 1 is obtained by changing one xyq of a word represented by ∂Ej into xyq - 1xy or xyxyq - 1. Thus, when we write [formula] a word represented by ∂Ej + 1, at least one of [formula] must be 1, and one of [formula] is greater than 2. Since C is disjoint from Ej and Ej + 1, the word corresponding to [formula] is of the form [formula], which contains both of xyx and yn for some n  >  2. Consequently, by Lemma [\ref=lem:key], the disk D cannot be primitive, a contradiction again.

From the claim, at least one of the disks from surgery on E along C is either E1 or Eq'. The disk E1 is primitive, and since we assumed that the circle ∂E'0 is a (p,q)-curve on the boundary of the solid torus [formula], the disk Eq' is also primitive by Lemma [\ref=lem:sequence], which completes the proof.

In the proof of the above theorem, we assumed   =  q, which implied that a resulting disk from surgery is E1 or Eq'. The same result holds when   =  p - q. But if we assume   =  {q',p - q'}, then the resulting disk will be E1 or Eq which turn out to be primitive in the corresponding sequence of disks. Together with this observation, assuming that D is disjoint from E, and so taking the disk D instead of an outermost subdisk C, we have the following result.

Let {D,E} be a primitive pair of V. Then there is a sequence of disks [formula] generated by a dual pair {E,E'} for some dual disk E' of E, such that D is one of the disks E1, Eq or Eq' in the sequence, where q' is the unique integer satisfying [formula] with 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2.

We say simply that a primitive pair has a common dual disk if the two disks of the pair have a common dual disk.

Given a lens space L(p,q) with 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, each primitive pair has a common dual disk if and only if q  =  1. In this case, it has a unique common dual disk if p  ≥  3, and has exactly two disjoint common dual disks if p  =  2.

Suppose that q  =  1, and let {D,E} be any primitive pair of V. By Lemma [\ref=lem:primitive_pair], there is a sequence of disks [formula] generated by a dual pair {E,E'}, in which D is E1 (here we have q'  =  q  =  1). By Lemma [\ref=lem:common_dual], D and E have a common dual disk.

Now, let E' be a common dual disk of D and E. Let E'0 be the unique semiprimitive disk in W disjoint from [formula]. We recall that E0' is the meridian disk of the solid torus [formula]. Then ∂E'0 intersects ∂D in p points. Cut the surface ∂W along the boundary circles ∂E' and ∂E'0 to obtain the 4-holed sphere Σ'. In Σ', the boundary circle ∂E is a single arc connecting two boundary circles of Σ' that came from ∂E'. But the boundary circle ∂D in Σ' consists of (p - 1) arcs connecting two boundary circles that came from ∂E'0 together with two arcs connecting ∂E' and ∂E'0 as in Figure [\ref=common_dual] (a). Observe that if there is a common dual disk of D and E other than E', then it cannot intersect [formula] otherwise it intersects ∂D or ∂E in more than one points. Thus the boundary of any common dual disk E'' of D and E other than E' is a circle inside Σ', and hence, from the figure, it is obvious that one more common dual disk E'' other than E' exists if and only if p  =  2, and such an E'' is unique in this case. See Figure [\ref=common_dual] (b).

Conversely, suppose that every primitive pair has a common dual disk. Choose any sequence of disks [formula] in V generated by some dual pair {E,E'}. Then one of the disks Eq' and Eq in the sequence is primitive, where q' satisfies 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2 and qq'  =    ±  1 mod p, which forms a primitive pair with E. If {E,Eq'} is a primitive pair, then it has a common dual disk, and so, by Lemma [\ref=lem:common_dual], there is a semiprimitive disk in V disjoint from E and Eq'. The only possible semiprimitive disk disjoint from E and Eq' is Eq' - 1 or Eq' + 1 by Lemma [\ref=lem:surgery_on_primitive], that is, Eq'  -  1 is E0 or Eq' + 1  =  Ep. In any cases, we have q  =  1 (the latter case implies (p,q)  =  (2,1)). The same conclusion holds in the case where {E,Eq} is a primitive pair.

It is clear that any primitive disk is a member of infinitely many primitive pairs. But a primitive pair can be contained at most two primitive triples, which is shown as follows.

Given a lens space L(p,q), for 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, with a genus two Heegaard splitting (V,W;Σ) of L(p,q), there is a primitive triple in V if and only if q  =  2 or p = 2q + 1. In this case, we have the following refinements.

If p  =  3, then each primitive pair is contained in a unique primitive triple. Further, each of the three primitive pairs in any primitive triple have unique common dual disks, which form a primitive triple of W.

If p  =  5, then each primitive pair having a common dual disk is contained in a unique primitive triple, and each having no common dual disk is contained in exactly two primitive triples.

If p  ≥  7, then each primitive pair having a common dual disk is contained either in a unique or in no primitive triple, and each having no common dual disk is contained in a unique primitive triple.

If p  ≥  5, then exactly one of the three primitive pairs in any primitive triple has a common dual disk.

Note that L(2q  +  1,q) is homeomorphic to L(2q + 1,2). We prove first the necessity together with the refinements. Suppose that q = 2 or p = 2q + 1, and let {D,E} be any primitive pair of V. By Lemma [\ref=lem:primitive_pair], there is a sequence of disks [formula] generated by a dual pair {E,E'}, in which D is one of E1, E2 or Eq.

If p = 3, the disk D is E1, and so E2 is the unique primitive disk disjoint from [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:surgery_on_primitive]. Thus {D,E} is contained in the unique primitive triple {D,E,E2}. The primitive pairs {E,D}  =  {E,E1} and {E,E2} in the triple have unique common dual disks by Lemma [\ref=lem:common_dual] and Theorem [\ref=thm:common_dual]. Figure [\ref=triple] (a) illustrates the boundary circles of the common dual disks E' and E'' of {E,E1} and {E,E2} respectively. In the figure, ∂E' is the union of two arcs connecting the points a and b, and ∂E'' is the union of three arcs connecting c, d and e. The circle ∂E'' really bounds a disk in W since it lies in the boundary of the 3-ball W cut off by [formula], where ∂E'0 is the union of the dotted arcs in the figure. Observe that E' and E'' are disjoint from and are not isotopic to each other.

Furthermore, exchanging the roles of D and E, we have the sequence of disks D0,D1,D2,D3 generated by {D,E'} where D0  =  E0, D1  =  E and D2  =  E2. By the same argument to the above, there exists the unique common dual disk E''' of {D,D2}  =  {D,E2} which is disjoint from and is not isotopic to the common dual disk E' of {D,D1}  =  {D,E}. Considering one more sequence of disks, that is, generated by {E2,E''}, whose first two disks are E3 and E, we see that E''' is disjoint from and is not isotopic to E'', and hence {E',E'',E'''} is a primitive triple in W.

If p = 5, then the disk D is either E1 or E2. If {D,E} has a common dual disk, then D is E1, and they are contained in the unique primitive triple {D,E,E2}. If {D,E} has no common dual disk, then D is E2, and they are contained in exactly two primitive triples {D,E,E1} and {D,E,E3}.

If p  ≥  7, then D is either E1, E2 or Eq. Observe that if one of E2 and Eq are primitive in the sequence, then the other one is not, while E1 is always primitive. If {D,E} has no common dual disk, then D is E2 or Eq. In this case, {D,E} is contained in the unique primitive triple {D,E,E1} if D is E2, or in the unique triple {D,E,Eq + 1} if D is Eq. Suppose next that {D,E} has a common dual disk. Then D is E1, and hence {D,E} is either contained in a unique primitive triple or contained in no primitive triple, according as E2 is primitive or not.

Now suppose that p  ≥  5, and let {D,E,F} be any primitive triple of V. Consider again the sequence of disks [formula] generated by a dual pair {E,E'} in the above, where D is one of E1, E2 or Eq. We have only two possibilities, the triple {D,E,F} is {E,E1,E2} or {E,Eq,Eq + 1}. In case of {D,E,F}  =  {E,E1,E2}, the pair {E,E1} has a unique common dual disk, say E', while {E,E2} has not. For the pair {E1,E2}, exchanging the roles of E1 and E, we have the sequence of disks [formula] generated by the dual pair {E1,E'}, where D0  =  E0, D1  =  E and D2  =  E2. Thus {E1,E2}  =  {E1,D2} has no common dual disk.

In case of {D,E,F}  =  {E,Eq,Eq + 1}, it is obvious that each of {E,Eq} and {E,Eq + 1} has no common dual disks while {Eq,Eq + 1} has one. The Figure [\ref=triple] (b) illustrates the case of L(5,2), and so {Eq,Eq + 1}  =  {E2,E3}. In the figure, the union of three arcs p, q and r is a circle, say l, which intersects each of ∂E2 and ∂E3 in a single point. To see that l bounds a disk in W, consider first the circle m that is the union of three arcs connecting d,e,f and g. The circle m bounds a disk in W since it lies in the boundary of the 3-ball W cut off by [formula], where ∂E' is the union of three arcs connecting a,b and c, and ∂E'0 is the union of the five dotted arcs in the figure. Consequently, we see that l also bounds a disk in W, that is the common dual disk of {E2,E3}, since l lies in the boundary of the 3-ball W cut off by E' and the disk bounded be m. Note that Figure [\ref=triple] (b) can be adapted easily for the pair {Eq,Eq + 1} in any L(p,2) with p  ≥  5 to show that the pair has a common dual disk.

Conversely, suppose that there is a primitive triple {D,E,F} of V. Choose a dual disk E' of E so that the resulting semiprimitive disk E0 intersects D minimally. If D is disjoint from E0, take E1  =  D, and if D intersects E0, take E1 the disk obtained from surgery on E0 along an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula] other than E. Then we have the sequence of disks [formula] generated by the dual pair {E,E'} starting with E0 and E1. The boundary circle of the meridian disk of the solid torus [formula] is a (p,)-curve for some ∈{q,q',p - q',p - q} on the boundary of [formula], where q' is the unique integer satisfying [formula] (mod p) and 1  ≤  q'  ≤  p / 2. Considering all the possible (p,)-curves, the disk D must be one of E1, Eq' and Eq. In each case, the primitive disk F is a disk in the sequence which is adjacent to D. Thus {D,F} is one of {E1,E2}, {Eq,Eq + 1} and {Eq',Eq' + 1}, which implies q = 2 or p = 2q + 1.

The disk complexes

Let M be an irreducible 3-manifold with compressible boundary. The disk complex of M is a simplicial complex defined as follows. The vertices are the isotopy classes of essential disks in M, and a collection of k + 1 vertices spans a k-simplex if and only if it admits a collection of representative disks which are pairwise disjoint. In particular, if M is a handlebody of genus g  ≥  2, then the disk complex is (3g  -  4)-dimensional and is not locally finite. The following is a key property of a disk complex.

If K is a full subcomplex of the disk complex satisfying the following condition, then K is contractible.

Let E and D be disks in M representing vertices of K. If they intersect each other transversely and minimally, then at least one of the disks from surgery on E along an outermost subdisk of D cut off by [formula] represents a vertex of K.

In [\cite=C], the above theorem is proved in the case where M is a handlebody, but the proof is still valid for an arbitrary irreducible manifold with compressible boundary. From the theorem, we see that the disk complex itself is contractible, and the non-separating disk complex is also contractible, which is the full subcomplex spanned by the vertices of non-separating disks. We denote by D(M) the non-separating disk complex of M.

Consider the case that M is a genus two handlebody V. Then the complex D(V) is 2-dimensional, and every edge of D(V) is contained in infinitely but countably many 2-simplices. For any two non-separating disks in V which intersect each other transversely and minimally, it is easy to see that "both" of the two disks obtained from surgery on one along an outermost subdisk of another cut off by their intersection are non-separating. This implies, from Theorem [\ref=thm:surgery], that D(V) and the link of any vertex of D(V) are all contractible. Thus we see that D(V) deformation retracts to a tree in the barycentric subdivision of it. Actually, this tree is a dual complex of D(V). A portion of the non-separating disk complex of V together with its dual tree is described in Figure [\ref=disk_complex].

The primitive disk complexes

Now we return to the genus two Heegaard splitting (V,W;Σ) of a lens space L  =  L(p,q). Again we will assume that 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2. The primitive disk complex P(V) for L(p,q) is defined to be the full subcomplex of D(V) spanned by the vertices of primitive disks in V. From the structure of D(V), we see that every connected component of any full subcomplex of D(V) is contractible. Thus P(V) is either contractible by itself or each of its connected components is contractible. In this section, we describe the complete combinatorial structure of the primitive disk complex P(V) for each lens space. In particular, we find all lens spaces whose primitive disk complexes are contractible.

As in the previous sections, let E be a primitive disk in V with a dual disk E'. The disk E' forms a complete meridian system of W together with the semiprimitive disk E'0 in w disjoint from [formula]. Assigning the symbols x and y to the oriented circles ∂E' and ∂E'0 respectively, any oriented simple closed curve, especially the boundary circle of any essential disk in V, represents an element of the free group π1(W)  =  〈x,y〉 in terms of x and y.

Let D be a non-separating disk in V. A simple closed curve l on ∂V intersecting ∂D transversely in a single point is called a dual circle of D.

Let {D1,D2} be a complete meridian system of V. Suppose that the non-separating disks D1 and D2 satisfy the following conditions:

for each i∈{1,2}, all intersections of ∂Di and [formula] have the same sign;

for each i∈{1,2}, the circle ∂Di represents an element wi of the form (xyq)mixyni, where [formula] and n1  ≠  n2;

any subarc of [formula] with both endpoints on ∂D1 intersects ∂D2; and

there exists a dual circle of D1 disjoint from [formula].

Then there exists a non-separating disk D* in V disjoint from [formula] satisfying the following:

all intersections of ∂D* and [formula] have the same sign;

∂D* represents an element of the form (xyq)m1  +  m2  +  1xyn1  +  n2  -  q;

for each i∈{1,2}, any subarc of [formula] with both endpoints on ∂Di intersects ∂D*; and

for each i∈{1,2}, there exists a dual circle of Di disjoint from [formula].

For i∈{1,2}, let νi be a connected subarc of ∂Di that determines the subword yni of wi. Cutting off ∂V by [formula], we obtain the 4-holed sphere [formula]. We denote by d±i the boundary circles of [formula] coming from ∂Di, and by ν±i the subarc of d±i coming from νi. By the assumption (2), we may assume without loss of generality that each oriented arc component [formula] directs from d+i1 to d-i2 for certain i1,i2∈{1,2}. By the assumptions (3) and (4), the 4-holed sphere [formula] and the arcs [formula] on [formula] can be drawn as in one of the two diagrams of Figure [\ref=fig:L_or_R-replacement]. In the figure the arcs ν±i in d±i are drawn in bold.

Let D* be the horizontal disk in each of the diagrams. It is clear that D* satisfies conditions (1) and (3). Also, the simple closed curve on ∂V obtained from the two arcs l1 and l2 depicted in the figure by gluing back along d±1 and d±2 is a dual circle of Di disjoint from [formula], and so the condition (4) holds for D*. Moreover, it is easily seen that all but one component ν* of ∂D* cut off by [formula], shown in Figure [\ref=fig:L_or_R-replacement], determine a word of the form yq. Hence it suffices to show that the arc ν* determines a word of the form yn1  +  n2  -  q. From the arcs [formula], algebraically n1  +  n2 arcs of [formula] come down and all of them pass trough [formula] from above, where the arc [formula] is shown in Figure [\ref=fig:L_or_R-replacement]. Since the arc [formula] determines a word of the form yq, the arc ν* determines a word of the form yn1  +  n2  -  q.

Let (D1,D2) be an ordered pair of disjoint non-separating disks in V such that the (unordered) pair {D1,D2} satisfies the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem:key_lemma_for_non-connectivity]. Then there exists a disk D* as in the lemma and we again obtain new ordered pairs (D1,D*) and (D*,D2) such that both {D1,D*} and {D*,D2} satisty the conditions of the lemma. We call these new pairs (D1,D*) and (D*,D2) the pairs obtained by R-replacement and L-replacement, respectively, of (D1,D2).

For a lens space L(p,q) with 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, the primitive disk complex P(V) for L(p,q) is contractible if and only if [formula].

The sufficiency follows directly from Theorem [\ref=thm:primitive] and Theorem [\ref=thm:surgery]. For the necessity, we will show that P(V) is not connected. Suppose that p and q do not satisfy the condition [formula]. Then there exist unique relatively prime integers m and r such that p = qm  +  r with 2  ≤  r  ≤  q - 2, and hence there exist natural numbers s and t with sr  -  tq  =  q  +  1. Consider the unique continued fraction expansion

[formula]

where pi  ≥  1 for [formula] and pk  ≥  2.

Let E be any primitive disk in V and let E' be a dual disk of E. The boundary circle of the semiprimitive disk in W disjoint from [formula] is a (p,)-curve on the boundary of the solid torus [formula] for some ∈{q,q',p - q',p - q}, where q' satisfies 0  <  q'  <  p and [formula]. We will consider only the case of   =  q, that is, the boundary circle is a (p,q)-curve. The following argument can be easily adapted for the other cases.

Consider any sequence of disks [formula] in V generated by a dual pair {E,E'}. Note that the disks Em and Em + 1 in the sequence are not primitive since ∂Em and ∂Em + 1 represent elements of the form (xyq)m - 1xyq  +  r and (xyq)mxyr respectively. Set D0  =  Em and D- 1  =  E. Since D0 and D- 1 satisfy the conditions of Lemma [\ref=lem:key_lemma_for_non-connectivity], we obtain a new ordered pair (D0,D1) by an R-replacement of (D0,D- 1). The disk D1 is not primitive since ∂D1 represents an element of the form (xyq)mxyr. (Actually, D1 can be chosen to be the disk Em + 1 in the sequence.) Applying R-replacements (p0  -  1) times more, starting at (D0,D1), as

[formula]

we obtain the pair (D0,Dp0). Next we apply L-replacements p1 times starting at (D0,Dp0) as

[formula]

to obtain the pair (Dp0  +  p1,Dp0). Continuing this process, we finally obtain either the pair [formula] if k is odd, or [formula] if k is even, of pairwise disjoint non-separating disks. See Figure [\ref=fig:sequence_of_triangles].

We assign D0 and D- 1 the rational numbers 1 / 0 and 0 / 1, respectively. We inductively assign rational numbers to the disks appearing in the above process as follows. Let (D*,D*  *) be an ordered pair of non-separating disks appearing in the process. Assume that we have already assigned D* and D*  * rational numbers a1  /  b1 and a2  /  b2, respectively. Then we assign the next disk obtained by L or R-replacement of (D*,D*  *) the rational number (a1  +  a2)  /  (b1  +  b2).

Claim. If a disk Dj, for [formula], appearing in the above process is assigned a rational number a  /  b, then ∂Dj represents an element of the form (xyq)dxyar  -  (b - 1)q for some non-negative integer d.

Proof of Claim. If j  =   - 1, then a  /  b  =  0  /  1 and ∂D- 1  =  ∂E represents x and we have ar  -  (b  -  1)q  =  0. If j  =  0, then a  /  b  =  1  /  0 and ∂D0  =  ∂Em represents an element of the form (xyq)m  -  1xyq + r and we have ar  -  (b  -  1)q  =  q  +  r.

Assume that the claim is true for any Di with i less than j and that Dj is obtained from (D*,D*  *). If D* and D*  * are assigned rational numbers a1  /  b1 and a2  /  b2, respectively, then Dj is assigned (a1  +  a2)  /  (b1  +  b2) by definition. By the assumption, ∂D* and ∂D*  * determine elements of the forms (xyq)d1xya1r  -  (b1 - 1)q and (xyq)d2xya2r  -  (b2 - 1)q respectively, for some non-negative integers d1 and d2. By Lemma [\ref=lem:key_lemma_for_non-connectivity], the circle ∂Dj determines an element of the form (xyq)d1  +  d2  +  1xy(a1 + a2)r  -  (b1 + b2 - 1)q, and hence the induction completes the proof.

Due to well-known properties of the Farey graph, see e.g. [\cite=HT85], [formula] is assigned s  /  (t + 1). Therefore, by the claim, [formula] determines an element of the form (xyq)dxysr  -  tq, hence (xyq)dxyq + 1. This implies that [formula] is primitive.

Now, we focus on the four disks D- 1, D0, D1 and [formula]. Since the dual complex of the disk complex D(V) is a tree, and the disks D0 and D1 are not primitive, the primitive disks D- 1 and [formula] belong to different components of P(V). This implies that P(V) is not connected.

Now we are ready to give a precise description of the primitive disk complex P(V) of each lens space. For convenience, we classify all the edges and 2-simplices of P(V) as follows.

An edge of P(V) is called an edge of type-0 (type-1, type-2, respectively) if a primitive pair representing the end vertices of the edge has no common dual disk (has a unique common dual disk, has exactly two common dual disks which form a primitive pair in W, respectively).

A 2-simplex of P(V) is called a 2-simplex of type-1 (of type-3, respectively) if exactly one of the three primitive pairs in the primitive triple representing the three edges of the 2-simplex has a unique common dual disk (if all the three pairs have unique common dual disks which form a primitive triple in W, respectively).

By Theorems [\ref=thm:common_dual] and [\ref=thm:triple], we see that each of the edges and 2-simplices of P(V) is one of those types in the above. Consider first the case where P(V) is not contractible, that is, non-connected. In this case, P(V) is 1-dimensional by Theorem [\ref=thm:triple]. Given a primitive disk E in V, we can choose infinitely many non-isotopic dual disks E' of E. Considering the sequences of disks generated by the dual pair {E,E'} for each choice of E', in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:contractible], we can find infinitely many connected components of P(V) which do not contain the vertex represented by E. Thus P(V) has infinitely many connected components, which are all trees isomorphic to each other. Any vertex of P(V) has infinite valency, and further, infinitely many edges of type-0 and of type-1 meet in each vertex. The contractible case can be summarized as follows, which is a direct consequence of Theorems [\ref=thm:contractible], [\ref=thm:common_dual] and [\ref=thm:triple].

Given any lens space L(p,q) with 1  ≤  q  ≤  p / 2, if the primitive disk complex P(V) of L(p,q) is contractible, then [formula] and P(V) is contained in one of the following cases.

If q  ≠  2 and p  ≠  2q  +  1, then P(V) is a tree, and every vertex has infinite valency. In this case,

if p = 2 and q = 1, then every edge is of type-2.

if p  ≥  4 and q = 1, then every edge is of type-1.

if q  ≠  1, then every edge is of either type-0 or type-1, and infinitely many edges of type-0 and of type-1 meet in each vertex.

If q  =  2 or p = 2q + 1, then P(V) is 2-dimensional, and every vertex meets infinitely many 2-simplices. In this case,

if p  =  3, then every edge is of type-1, every 2-simplex is of type-3, and every edge is contained in a unique 2-simplex.

if p  =  5, then every edge is of either type-0 or type-1, and every 2-simplex is of type-1. Every edge of type-0 is contained in exactly two 2-simplices, while every edge of type-1 in a unique 2-simplex.

if p  ≥  7, then every edge is of either type-0 or type-1, and every 2-simplex is of type-1. Every edge of type-0 is contained in a unique 2-simplex. Every edge of type-1 is contained in a unique 2-simplex or in no 2-simplex.

Figure [\ref=shape] illustrates a portion of each of the contractible primitive disk complexes P(V) classified in the above, together with its surroundings in D(V). We label simply E or Ej for the vertices represented by disks E or Ej. In the case (2)-(b), the complex P(V) for L(5,2), every edge is contained a unique "band". The edges in the boundary of a band are of type-1, while the edges inside a band are of type-0. The whole figure of P(V) for L(5,2) can be imagined as the union of infinitely many bands such that any of two bands are disjoint from each other or intersects in a single vertex. In the case (2)-(c), there are two kind of sequences of disks [formula] generated by a dual pair {E,E'}. The first one has primitive disks E1,Eq,Ep - q and Ep - 1, while the second one has E1,E2,Ep - 2 and Ep - 1. Figure [\ref=shape] (2)-(c) illustrates an example of the first one.
