Deduction of an upper bound on the success probability of port-based teleportation from the no-cloning theorem and the no-signaling principle

Quantum teleportation [\cite=teleportation] is a fundamental protocol of quantum information theory in which an unknown quantum state [formula] is destroyed at its original location by Alice and reconstructed at another location by Bob. The protocol works as follows: Alice and Bob must initially share a maximally entangled state, Alice applies a Bell measurement to her systems, she communicates her measurement outcome to Bob, who then applies a unitary correction operation according to Alice's message.

Here, we consider a different type of teleportation protocol, which we refer to as port-based teleportation (PBT). PBT was devised by Ishizaka and Hiroshima [\cite=IH08] [\cite=IH09] with the purpose of implementing a universal programmable quantum processor that succeeds with probability arbitrarily close to unity; this task can be achieved using standard teleportation, too, but with a very small success probability for input states of big dimension [\cite=NC97].

In this paper we consider general PBT protocols, which allow Alice to teleport an unknown quantum state [formula] to one of N ports at Bob's site. PBT requires that Alice and Bob share quantum entanglement and consists of the following steps. Alice applies a measurement with outcome [formula]; if k = 0, teleportation fails, otherwise [formula] is teleported to the kth port. Alice communicates k to Bob, who then discards the states at ports with indexes distinct from k. No further correction operations are required; this advantage over standard teleportation makes PBT useful in various quantum information tasks. In the probabilistic version of PBT, [formula] is teleported perfectly but with a success probability p < 1; in the deterministic version, outcome k = 0 never occurs but the fidelity of the teleported state is smaller than unity [\cite=IH08] [\cite=IH09].

Besides its use as a universal programmable quantum processor, PBT can be used to implement instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation (INLC), reducing exponentially the amount of needed entanglement compared to schemes based on standard teleportation [\cite=BK11]. INLC is the application of a nonlocal unitary operation U on a state [formula] shared by two or more distant parties with a single round of classical communication (CC). If two rounds of CC are allowed, U can be implemented trivially as follows: Alice teleports her part of [formula] to Bob, who then applies U to [formula], now in his location, and then teleports Alice's share of the state back to her. However, it is not trivial to complete this task with only one round of CC. It was Vaidman [\cite=V03] who first showed how to implement this task using a recursive scheme based on standard teleportation, which consumes an amount of entanglement growing double exponentially with the number of qubits n of the input state [formula]. However, a scheme by Beigi and König [\cite=BK11] based on PBT allows the implementation of INLC with an amount of entanglement growing only exponentially with n.

INLC has application to other distributed quantum tasks: it allows the implementation of instantaneous nonlocal measurements (INLM) and also breaks the security of position-based quantum cryptography (PBQC) and some quantum tagging schemes [\cite=KBMS06] [\cite=M10.1] [\cite=*M10.2] [\cite=KMS11] [\cite=LL11] [\cite=pbqc] [\cite=BFSS11]. INLM is the measurement of a nonlocal observable in a distributed quantum state with a single round of CC [\cite=GR02] [\cite=V03] [\cite=GRV03] [\cite=CCJP10]. Quantum tagging [\cite=KBMS06] [\cite=M10.1] [\cite=*M10.2] [\cite=KMS11] [\cite=K11.1] and PBQC [\cite=pbqc] [\cite=BFSS11] are cryptographic tasks that rely on quantum information processing and relativistic constraints with the goals of verifying the location of an object and providing secure communication with a party at a given location, respectively.

It is interesting to investigate the limitations and possibilities on quantum information processing tasks that can be derived directly from no-signaling (NS) and other fundamental principles of quantum theory. Some important results obtained with this approach are the following: the maximum fidelity achieved by quantum cloning machines can be deduced from NS [\cite=G98], security of quantum key distribution can be guaranteed as long as NS is satisfied [\cite=BHK05], and the recently discovered information causality principle [\cite=ic] implies Tsirelson's bound on the amount of nonlocality for quantum correlations.

In this paper, we show an upper bound on the success probability of probabilistic PBT of a n-qubit state from the no-cloning theorem and the no-signaling principle:

[formula]

Our bound agrees with the maximum success probability obtained in [\cite=IH09] for the particular case n = 1:

[formula]

Thus, we confirm the hypothesis presented in [\cite=IH09] that Eq. ([\ref=eq:1]) can be derived from fundamental laws of physics. It is an interesting open problem to find a probabilistic PBT protocol for the case n > 1 and to see whether our bound is achievable.

Comparing Eqs. ([\ref=eq:2]) and ([\ref=eq:1]), we see that (pmax)n can be bigger than the upper bound on p, which means that applying PBT individually to each qubit of [formula] can give a higher success probability than applying PBT globally to [formula]. However, we justify the restriction that [formula] must be localized to a single port by noting that the advantage of PBT as described here, at least for implementing a universal programmable quantum processor and INLC, is that, before receiving Alice's message, Bob can apply the desired quantum operation to the state at every port, after which, [formula] is transformed as desired. Clearly, this advantage is lost if the qubits of [formula] spread among different ports.

Before summarizing our proof of Eq. ([\ref=eq:2]), it will be useful to give a general description of the PBT protocol. For simplicity of the exposition we consider a pure input state [formula]. Due to the linearity of quantum theory, the protocol works for mixed states too. Alice and Bob share a fixed entangled state [formula], which is independent of [formula] because this is arbitrary and unknown. Bob has N ports {Bj}Nj = 1, hence [formula], where [formula]. System A includes any ancilla held by Alice and so has an arbitrarily big dimension. However, in [\cite=IH08] [\cite=IH09], [formula] and [formula]. We follow a notation in which subindex a is written in [formula] only when we wish to emphasize that the system a is in state [formula], similarly for other states and systems. The initial global state is

[formula]

Alice applies a generalized measurement, which in general can be decomposed into a unitary operation U acting jointly on a and A, followed by a projective measurement. Alice obtains outcome [formula] with probability qk > 0 and k = 0 with probability [formula]. If [formula], the global state is transformed into

[formula]

where [formula], so state [formula] is teleported to port Bk. However, if k = 0, PBT fails; in this case we denote the final state as

[formula]

The total success probability is

[formula]

Now we are able to summarize the proof. First, we present a version of the no-cloning theorem, which allows us to show that the probabilities qk and states [formula] cannot depend on [formula], while the state [formula] must do, as the notation suggests. Second, we use the no-signaling principle to show that the state j of port Bj before implementing PBT must be of the form

[formula]

where j,i and (ψ)j are the states to which Bj transforms into after outcomes k = i∉{0,j} and k = 0 are obtained, respectively. Since j, j,i and (ψ)j are reduced states of [formula], [formula] and [formula], respectively, j and j,i do not depend on [formula], while (ψ)j does. Third, we use the independence of these states from [formula] and Eq. ([\ref=eq:3]) to show that if there exists a protocol that achieves success probability qj for some states j and j,i then there exists a protocol satisfying

[formula]

which achieves the same success probability. Fourth, we assume Eq. ([\ref=eq:5]) and present a protocol in which Alice tries to send Bob a random message of 2n bits. This protocol combines the superdense coding protocol [\cite=sdc] and a modified PBT protocol in which Alice holds every port except for Bj, which is held by Bob, but does not allow communication. We show that this protocol succeeds with probability

[formula]

for some probability rj. Since there is not communication in such a protocol, the no-signaling principle implies that Bob cannot obtain any information about Alice's message. This means that Bob can only obtain the correct message with the probability of making a random guess: pj' = 4- n . Thus, we have

[formula]

Summing over [formula] and using Eq. ([\ref=eq:4]), we obtain that p = fn,N(R), where [formula] and [formula]. It is straightforward to obtain that the condition 0  ≤  p  ≤  1 is satisfied only if R  ≤  4- nN . Since the function fn,N(R) decreases monotonically with R in the range

[formula]

Proof of the theorem

In general, the physical operation O can be decomposed into a unitary operation U acting on the input system and an ancilla of sufficiently big dimension, followed by a projective measurement. Without loss of generality we can consider that the measurement is made on a pointer system π of dimension N + 1, with the outcome indicating the induced transformation. Let [formula] be a fixed initial state of π and [formula] be an orthonormal basis of Hπ. U must be such that

[formula]

where [formula]. Let Ha have dimension d, [formula] be an orthonormal basis of Ha and the expansion of [formula] in this basis be

[formula]

Applying Eq. ([\ref=eq:a1]) to state [formula] we have

[formula]

On the one hand, Eqs. ([\ref=eq:a2]), ([\ref=eq:a3]) and the linearity of unitary evolution imply that

[formula]

On the other hand, Eqs. ([\ref=eq:a1]) and ([\ref=eq:a2]) imply

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula] are orthonormal bases, it is straightforward to see that both Eqs. ([\ref=eq:a4]) and ([\ref=eq:a5]) can be valid only if

[formula]

for all [formula] and all [formula]. Since this result is independent of the input state [formula] and of its orthogonal decomposition, it must be that q(ψ)k and [formula] do not depend on [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

for all [formula] and [formula].

Moreover, applying Eq. ([\ref=eq:a1]) to [formula], taking the inner product of [formula] and [formula], and using Eq. ([\ref=eq:a7]) we obtain

[formula]

Details about the primed PBT protocol

In this section we provide specific details about the primed PBT protocol described in the main text, which achieves success probability qj and satisfies Eq. ([\ref=eq:5]) of the main text for the corresponding primed states,

[formula]

We will use the identity given in the main text, which is satisfied for any quantum state [formula] of dimension 2n:

[formula]

where we define the set of unitary operations [formula], σ0 is the identity acting on [formula] and {σi}3i = 1 are the Pauli matrices.

The following, primed, PBT protocol achieves success probability qj and satisfies Eq. ([\ref=eq:b1]).

Firstly, consider the stage previous to the implementation of PBT in which the resource state is prepared and distributed to Alice and Bob. An ancilla a' with Hilbert space Ha' of dimension 4n is prepared in the state [formula], where [formula] is an orthonormal basis of Ha'. Consider the resource state [formula] for the PBT protocol defined by Eqs. ([\ref=eq:7])-([\ref=eq:8.5]) of the main text. In the primed protocol, the controlled unitary [formula] is applied on [formula] in order to prepare the new resource state

[formula]

where (Vl)Bi acts on HBi only. The system a'A is sent to Alice and the system B is sent to Bob. The initial state of system Bj in this protocol is [formula]. From the definitions of j', [formula] and j (Eq. ([\ref=eq:8.6]) of the main text), Eq. ([\ref=eq:b2]), and the fact that j is independent of [formula], it is straightforward to obtain that

[formula]

as claimed.

Now consider the implementation of the primed PBT protocol. Alice applies the unitary operation [formula] on the system aa', as the notation suggests. The global state transforms into

[formula]

Then, Alice applies her operations corresponding to the PBT protocol defined by Eqs. ([\ref=eq:7])-([\ref=eq:8.5]) of the main text on the system aA only. With probability qj, Alice obtains outcome k = j  ≠  0. Due to the linearity of unitary evolution, it is not difficult to obtain that, in this case, the global state transforms into

[formula]

Thus, we see that the state [formula] is teleported to port Bj, as required. This protocol works because, as we can see from Eq. ([\ref=eq:b5]), the operations on system B commute with the operations performed by Alice on aA, which is necessary for satisfaction of the no-signaling principle. Therefore, this protocol is equivalent to the following: conditioned on a' being in the state [formula], if an outcome k = j  ≠  0 is obtained, the state [formula] is teleported to port Bj; then, Bob applies [formula], after which, the state of system Bj transforms into [formula], as desired.

The state of system Bj, after an outcome k = i∉{0,j} is obtained, is [formula]. From the definitions of j,i' and j,i (Eq. ([\ref=eq:8.8]) of the main text), Eq. ([\ref=eq:b2]), and the fact that j,i is independent of [formula], it can easily be obtained that

[formula]

as claimed.

If Alice obtains the outcome k = 0, the final global state is

[formula]

where ψl refers to dependence on the state [formula]. The final state of system Bj in this case is [formula]. From the previous definition of j'(ψ) and that one of (ψ)j, given by Eq. ([\ref=eq:8.9]) of the main text, it is straightforward to obtain that

[formula]

as given in the main text.
