Let G be a simple graph with a countable set P of vertices, also called polymers. If {γ,γ'}  ⊂  G is an edge of the graph we say that the two polymers are incompatible and write [formula]. Otherwise they are compatible and write γ  ~  γ'. A complex valued function φ(γ), γ∈P, is given. We call φ(γ) the weight, or the activity, of the polymer γ. For any finite subset Λ  ⊂  P, the partition function Z(Λ) is defined by

[formula]

The sum runs over all subsets S of Λ such that γ  ~  γ' for any two distinct elements of S. If S contains only one element it is considered as a compatible subset, and if [formula], the product is interpreted as the number 1.

A multi-index X on the set P is a function X(γ), γ∈P, taking non-negative integer values and such that [formula] is a finite non empty set. Then

[formula]

where the coefficients aT(X) depend only on X (not on Λ), and [formula] only if X is a cluster, i.e., only if the restriction of G to the vertices in sup X is a connected graph.

Theorem: Assume that there is a positive function μ(γ), γ∈P, such that, for all γ0∈P,

[formula]

Then, for all γ1∈P, we have

[formula]

The theorem is proved by an induction argument using the following relation: If [formula], then

[formula]

with Λ0  =  {γ∈Λ:γ  ~  γ0}.

Note: To any multi-index X we associate a graph g(X) with [formula] vertices: X(γi) distinct vertices are associated to γi, for each [formula]. We draw an edge between the vertices associated to γi and γj if [formula], and also if γi  =  γj. We denote by G(X) the set of all connected subgraphs of g(X) whose vertices coincide with those of g(X). The number of edges of a graph g is denoted by |g|. If |X| = 1 we interpret G(X) as having one subgraph with |g| = 0. Then aT(X) = 0 if g(X) is not connected, otherwise:

[formula]

This formula, and the expansion of ln Z(Λ), was proved by G. Gallavotti, A. Martin-Lof and S. Miracle-Sole in: "Mathematical Methods in Statistical Mechanics", A. Lenard, ed., pp. 162-202, Springer, Berlin, 1973.
