Complete Residue Systems: A Primer and an Application

Introduction

Complete residue systems play an integral role in abstract algebra and number theory, and a description is typically found in any number theory textbook (see, for instance, [\cite=MR1382656] [\cite=MR2445243] [\cite=MR0092794]). In Section 1, we provide a concise overview of complete residue systems, including a robust definition, several well-known results, and a proof to the converse of a well-known theorem. In Section 2, we derive ancillary results pertaining to an application arising from the study of the roots of nonnegative matrices, which extend, to a certain extent, Theorems 65 and 66 in [\cite=MR2445243].

Complete Residue Systems

Our discussion of complete residue systems begins with the following definition.

With the aforementioned definition, we readily glean the following equivalent properties if R is a CRS(h):

if i  ≠  j, then qi  ≠  qj;

if i  ≠  j, then [formula]; and

for [formula], if [formula], then [formula] for all j  ≠  i.

The next two results are well-known number-theoretic results (see, for instance, [\cite=MR1382656], [\cite=MR1008474] or [\cite=MR2445243]).

If gcd (k,m)  =  d, then [formula] if and only if [formula].

In particular is the following useful case.

If gcd (k,m)  =  1, then [formula] if and only if [formula]

If [formula] is a complete residue system [formula] and [formula], then [formula] is a complete residue system [formula] if and only if gcd (p,h)  =  1.

Quite frequently in the literature (see [\cite=MR2445243], [\cite=MR1382656], [\cite=MR1008474], [\cite=MR0201369], or [\cite=MR0092794]), one finds only sufficiency, however, as the following proof shows, necessity holds as well.

If gcd (p,h)  =  1, then, following , [formula] if and only if [formula], which holds if and only if i = j.

Conversely, if gcd (p,h) = d  >  1, then [formula] is not a CRS(h / d). Thus, there exist distinct integers i and j such that [formula], which holds, by , if and only if [formula], i.e., [formula] is not a CRS(h).

The Application

For h  >  1, let [formula] and [formula], i.e., [formula].

If [formula] is a set of integers, then [formula] if and only if [formula] is a complete residue system [formula].

If [formula] is a CRS(h), then, for each [formula], there exists one (and only one) [formula] such that [formula], i.e., there exists an integer lk such that ak  =  hlk  +  qk. For each such k,

[formula]

so that [formula].

Conversely, suppose [formula] is not a CRS(h), and for every k, let [formula]. Then [formula] so that [formula].

For p  >  1, let [formula]. Then Ωph  =  Ωh if and only if gcd (p,h)  =  1.

If a, b, c, and [formula], then [formula] if and only if [formula].

Note that

[formula]

If [formula] is a complete residue system [formula] and l is any integer, then [formula] is a complete residue system [formula] if and only if gcd (p,h) = 1.

If a, b, c d and [formula], then [formula] if and only if [formula].

Note that

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula] are sets of integers, then [formula] is a complete residue system [formula] if and only if [formula] is a complete residue system [formula].

If [formula] is not a CRS(h), then there exist distinct integers i, [formula] such that [formula]. Following , [formula] if and only if [formula]; i.e., if and only if [formula] is not a CRS(h).

If [formula], and [formula], then there exists l∈L such that [formula] if and only if gcd (h,p)  =  1.

For any [formula], note that

[formula]

so that [formula].

If gcd (p,h)  =  1, then, following , for each k, the set [formula] is a CRS(p); in particular, there exists [formula] such that [formula], i.e., k + hlk is divisible by p. Moreover, the set

[formula]

is a CRS(h); indeed, following ,

[formula]

if and only if [formula], which holds, following , if and only if [formula]. Since [formula] is a CRS(h), it follows that i = j, and the claim is established.

Conversely, suppose gcd (p,h)  =  d  >  1. We claim that for at least one k, there does not exist [formula] such that [formula]; suppose the assertion is false so that for each k, there exists lk such that [formula], i.e., there exists an integer qk such that k + hlk  =  pqk, or hlk  =  pqk  -  k so that [formula]. Since [formula], the set [formula] is a CRS(h), establishing a contradiction since gcd (p,h)  ≠  1. Following , at least one exponent in the set [formula] is not an integer so that [formula].

If [formula], and [formula] or [formula], then there exists l∈L such that [formula] if and only if gcd (h,p)  =   gcd (h,q)  =  1.
