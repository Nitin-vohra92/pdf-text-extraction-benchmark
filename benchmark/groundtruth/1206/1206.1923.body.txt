A proton-pentaquark mixing and the intrinsic charm model

Today there are many articles [\cite=Lykasov:2012hf] [\cite=Freeman:2012ry] related to intrinsic charm concept, which was introduced by Brodsky et al. [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb]. In the present article we want to discuss a new interpretation of this phenomenon. As will be shown below, the intrinsic charm problem is closely related to the pentaquark [formula] existence and mixing of that state with the proton.

Authors of ref. [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb] made the assumption that Fock state decomposition of the proton wave-function contains a non-negligible [formula] component, which results in the specific distribution of c-quark in proton. According to [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb], the probability to find [formula] configuration, in classical perturbation theory, is given by the expression

[formula]

where qi is the momentum of i-th quark, A is an initial state, M is a transition matrix element, Ei is the energy of i-th quark.

Transforming the above expression and integrating over all quark's contributions except of one c-quark, the authors of [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb], derive the expression the distribution of c-quark:

[formula]

where N is determined by normalization condition for one c-quark [formula].

The distribution P(x) is shown in fig. 1 by solid line. From eq.[\eqref=eq:brodsky] and Fig.1 we can see that average momentum fraction of c-quark is equal to 2 / 7. As a result, noticeable contribution of intrinsic charm into inclusive production of D-, J / ψ or χc-mesons should be seen at 〈x〉  ≈  2 / 7 [\cite=Gershtein:1980jb] [\cite=Litvine:1999sv].

It is necessary to notice that the probability to find [formula] configuration [\eqref=eq:pert] was constructed under inherently perturbative assumption, since the factor 1 / (E - E') is used. Let us consider alternative, essentially nonperturbative, model [\cite=Kuti:1971ph]. We construct structure function for c-quark in the pentaquark [formula], which has quantum numbers like a proton. The probability to find i-th quark with momentum fraction xi in proton for small xi can be obtained from Regge asymptotic:

[formula]

where αi is the intercept of corresponding leading Regge trajectory. For sea quarks this parameter is equal to 1, in the case of light valence quarks we have α1,2,3  =  αu,d(0)  ≈  0.5 from leading Regge f, A2 trajectories, while for c-quark the intercept of leading J / ψ-trajectory is equal to α4,5  =  αc(0)  ≈   - 2.2 [\cite=Kartvelishvili:1977pi] [\cite=Gershtein:2006ng]. Thus, the structure function of the n-particle state has the form

[formula]

Integrating this expression in the case of |uudc〉 pentaquark over [formula] we can calculate the structure function of c-quark:

[formula]

where M is a parameter, which stands normalization: [formula].

In original Kuti-Weisskopf model [\cite=Kuti:1971ph] the unknown parameter γA ~  =  ~ 3 determining the sea normalization can be obtain using Drell-Yan-West relation [\cite=Drell:1969km]. Using this value we get

[formula]

The structure function of the c-quark for the pentaquark [formula] [\eqref=eq:kuti] is shown in Fig. 1 by dotted line in comparison with the formula [\eqref=eq:brodsky].

As we can see in Fig. [\ref=fig:str] the probability distributions [\eqref=eq:brodsky] and [\eqref=eq:kuti] are almost the same, under parameters we chose. The result is amazing -- perturbative model [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb] and our non-perturbative model, based on Regge trajectories of c-quarks give the same probability distribution. The question is appeared, how it could happen. We have one solution only: the presented in ref. [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb] probability distribution refers to the c-quark distribution in the pentaquark [formula] and has nothing to do with sea c-quarks.

We have one more argument in favor of the hypothesis. It is well known that the quark distribution functions in K-mesons and π-mesons are different. The difference can be explained by the model [\eqref=eq:nonpert] (see [\cite=Chliapnikov:1977fc]) on the one hand and by [\eqref=eq:pert] model on the other hand. It convinces us that the probability distributions [\eqref=eq:brodsky] and [\eqref=eq:kuti] refer to the valence c-quark momentum distribution in the pentaquark [formula].

The next problem appeared is the proton-pentaquark mixing which determines absolute normalization. Let matrix element for [formula] be equal to V, then admixture of the pentaquark in a proton is given by factor V / (E1  -  E2), where E1, E2 are energies of the pentaquark and the nucleon respectively. The matrix element can be evaluated as ΛQCD and the energy difference can be estimated as the difference of masses. In that way the probability to find the pentaquark in a proton is less than:

[formula]

In fact we should expect the mixing to be much smaller. Most likely it is due to different color state of quarks in the pentaquark and in a proton. There are also experimental constraints on this parameter:

In the original work [\cite=Brodsky:1980pb], based on assumption that most of the charm cross-section comes from diffraction in pp-interaction, the mixing was evaluated by 1%.

In the later work [\cite=Hoffmann:1983ah] the restriction 0.59% was given, based on data of European Muon Collaboration (EMC) in hadronic scattering. The best fit to data gave 0.31%.

Differential spectrum of D-mesons in photo-production processes [\cite=Gershtein:1980jb] contradicts the intrinsic charm hypothesis and set the contribution restriction in the range of ~  0.1 - 0.2%.

The most severe restriction on the mixing hypothesis can be obtained by hidden charm particles production. Such analysis was performed in ref. [\cite=Litvine:1999sv]. According to this paper the upper bound in the [formula] probability is ~  10- 7.

The discussed model, based on the assumption about the pentaquark-proton mixing, gives a consistent interpretation of the intrinsic charm phenomenon, which is used for the hadron physics application [\cite=Lykasov:2012hf]. It is worth emphasizing that the observation of the intrinsic charm phenomenon can be result of existence of the stable pentaquark [formula]. A discovery of pentaquark [formula] or getting more stringent restriction is a task of future experiments.
