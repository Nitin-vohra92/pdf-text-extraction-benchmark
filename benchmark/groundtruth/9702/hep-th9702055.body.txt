The Lorentz group serves useful purposes in many branches of physics. In this note, we would like to show that the bilinear representation of the six-parameter Lorentz group [\cite=barg47] is the natural language for polarization of light waves. In studying polarized light propagating along the z direction, the traditional approach is to consider the x and y components of the electric fields. Their amplitude ratio and the phase difference determine the degree of polarization. Thus, we can change the polarization either by adjusting the amplitudes, by changing the relative phase shift, or both. For convenience, we call the optical device which changes amplitudes an "attenuator," and the device which changes the relative phase a "phase shifter."

Let us write the electric field vector as

[formula]

where A and B are the amplitudes which are real and positive numbers, and φ1 and φ2 are the phases of the x and y components respectively. This column matrix is called the Jones vector [\cite=jones41] [\cite=swind75]. The content of polarization is determined by the ratio:

[formula]

which can be written as one complex number:

[formula]

with

[formula]

The degree of polarization is measured by these two real numbers, which are the amplitude ratio and the phase difference respectively.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the transformation properties of this complex number w. The transformation takes place when the light beam goes through an optical filter whose transmission properties are not isotropic. There are two transverse directions which are perpendicular to each other. The absorption coefficient in one transverse direction could be different from the coefficient along the other direction. Thus, there is the "polarization" coordinate in which the absorption can be described by

[formula]

with η  =  η2  -  η1 . This attenuation matrix tells us that the electric fields are attenuated at two different rates. The exponential factor e- (η1  +  η2) / 2 reduces both components at the same rate and does not affect the degree of polarization. The effect of polarization is solely determined by the squeeze matrix

[formula]

This type of mathematical operation is quite familiar to us from squeezed states of light, if not from Lorentz boosts of spinors. For convenience, we call the above matrix an attenuator.

If the polarization coordinate is the same as the xy coordinate where the electric field components take the form of Eq.([\ref=expo1]), the above attenuator is directly applicable to the column matrix of Eq.([\ref=expo1]). If the polarization coordinate is rotated by an angle θ / 2, or by the matrix

[formula]

then the squeeze matrix becomes

[formula]

Another basic element is the optical filter with two different values of the index of refraction along the two orthogonal directions. The effect of this filter can be written as

[formula]

with λ  =  λ2  -  λ1 . In measurement processes, the overall phase factor e- i(λ1  +  λ2) / 2 cannot be detected, and can therefore be deleted. The polarization effect of the filter is solely determined by the matrix

[formula]

This phase-shifter matrix appears like a rotation matrix around the z axis in the theory of rotation groups, but it plays a different role in this paper. We shall hereafter call this matrix a phase shifter.

Here also, if the polarization coordinate makes an angle θ with the xy coordinate system, the phase shifter takes the form

[formula]

Since we are interested in repeated applications of these two different kinds of matrices with different parameters, we shall work with the generators of these transformations. Let us introduce the Pauli spin matrices of the form

[formula]

These matrices are written in a different convention. Here σ3 is imaginary, while σ2 is imaginary in the traditional notation. Also in this convention, we can construct three rotation generators

[formula]

which satisfy the closed set of commutation relations

[formula]

We can also construct three boost generators

[formula]

which satisfy the commutation relations

[formula]

The Ki matrices alone do not form a closed set of commutation relations, and the rotation generators Ji are needed to form a closed set:

[formula]

The six matrices Ji and Ki form a closed set of commutation relations, and they are like the generators of the Lorentz group applicable to the (3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space. The group generated by the above six matrices is called SL(2,c) consisting of all two-by-two complex matrices with unit determinant.

If we consider only the phase shifters, the mathematics is basically repeated applications of J1 and J2, resulting in applications also of J3. Thus, the phase-shift filters form an SU(2) or O(3)-like subgroup of the group SL(2,c). On the other hand, if we consider only the attenuators, the mathematics consists of repeated applications of K1 and J3, resulting in applications also of K2. This is evident from the commutation relation

[formula]

Indeed, J3,K1 and K2 form a closed set of commutation relations for the Sp(2) or O(2,1)-like subgroup of SL(2,c) [\cite=kitano89]. This three-parameter subgroup has been extensively discussed in connection with squeezed states of light [\cite=knp91].

If we use both the attenuators and phase shifters, the result is the full SL(2,c) group with six parameters. The transformation matrix is usually written as

[formula]

with the condition that its determinant be one: αδ  -  γβ = 1. The repeated application of two matrices of this kind results in

[formula]

The most general form of the polarization transformation is the application of this algebra to the column matrix of Eq.([\ref=expo1]).

We can obtain the same algebraic result by using the bilinear transformation:

[formula]

The repeated applications of these two transformations can be achieved from

[formula]

Then, it is possible to write w2 as a function of w, and the result is

[formula]

This is a reproduction of the algebra given in the matrix multiplication of Eq.([\ref=abgd2]). The form given in Eq.([\ref=bilin1]) is the bilinear representation of the Lorentz group [\cite=barg47].

Let us go back to physics. If we apply the matrix L of Eq.([\ref=abgd1]) to the column vector of Eq.([\ref=expo1]), then

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

In term of the physical quantity w defined in Eq.([\ref=ratio]), this formula becomes

[formula]

This equation is identical to the bilinear form given in Eq.([\ref=bilin1]), and the ratio w can now be identified with the w variable defined as the parameter of the bilinear representation of the Lorentz group in the same equation. As we stated before, the purpose of this paper was to derive the transformation property of this complex number, and the purpose has now been achieved. The bilinear representation of the Lorentz group is clearly the language of optical filters and resulting polarizations.

This report is largely based on our recent paper on the bilinear represention of the Lorentz group [\cite=hkn96].
