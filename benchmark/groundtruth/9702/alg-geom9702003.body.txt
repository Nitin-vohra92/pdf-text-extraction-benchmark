Dual varieties and the duality of the second fundamental form

Spherical case

In this article I would like to explain main ideas in my recent results on duality of the second fundamental form. (Urabe[\cite={urabe;dual}].)

Theory of dual varieties in the complex algebraic geometry is very interesting. (Griffiths and Harris [\cite=griffiths-harris;geo], Kleiman [\cite=kleiman;enume], Piene [\cite=piene;polar], Urabe [\cite=urabe;polar], Wallace [\cite=wallace;tangency].) Let [formula] be a complex projective space of dimension N, and [formula] be a complex algebraic subvariety. The set of all hyperplanes in [formula] forms another projective space [formula] of dimension N, which is called the dual projective space of [formula]. The dual projective space [formula] of [formula] is identified with [formula]. The closure in [formula] of the set of tangent hyperplanes to X is called the dual variety of X, and is denoted by [formula]. We say that a hyperplane H in [formula] is tangent to X, if we have a smooth point p∈X such that H contains the embedded tangent space of X at p. It is known that the dual variety [formula] is again a complex algebraic variety, and the dual variety [formula] of [formula] coincides with X.

We would like to develop similar theory in the real-analytic category. (Obata [\cite=obata;gauss].)

First, we fix the notations. Let N be a positive integer, and L be a vector space of dimension N + 1 over the real field [formula]. A fixed positive-definite inner product on L is denoted by (  ,   ). By S = {a∈L|(a,a) = 1} we denote the unit sphere in L. The sphere S has dimension N.

We consider a compact real-analytic irreducible subvariety M in S. We assume moreover that M has only ordinary singularities as singularities.

We have to explain the phrase of "ordinary singularity" here. Let X  ⊂  L be a real-analytic subset. For every point p∈X we can consider the germ (X,p) of X around p. The germ (X,p) is decomposed into into irreducible components. By dim (X,p) we denote the dimension of the germ (X,p). The germ (X,p) is said to be smooth, if (X,p) is real-analytically isomorphic to [formula] where n =  dim (X,p) and 0 is a point of [formula]. A point p of X is said to be smooth, if the germ (X,p) is smooth. We say that X has an ordinary singularity at p∈X, if every irreducible component of (X,p) is smooth.

Let Msmooth  ⊂  M be the set of smooth points p∈M with dim (M,p) =  dim M. Under our assumption Msmooth is dense in M.

For every point p∈Msmooth the tangent space Tp(M) of M at p is defined. Note in particular that Tp(M) is not an affine subspace but a vector subspace in L passing through the origin. The tangent space Tp(M) has dimension equal to dim M. A point q∈S is a normal vector of M in S at a point p∈M, if q is orthogonal to p and Tp(M). We say that a point q∈S is a normal vector of M in S, if q is a normal vector of M in S at some point p∈M. By [formula] we denote the closure in S of the set of normal vectors a of M in S with (a,a) = 1, and we call [formula] the dual variety of M  ⊂  S. The dual variety [formula] has a lot of interesting properties. However, [formula] is not a real-analytic subset in general.

Under our assumption the dual variety [formula] contains a dense smooth real-analytic subset whose connected components have the same dimension.

Let X  ⊂  S be a subset containing a dense smooth real-analytic subset whose connected components have the same dimension. Obviously we can define the dual variety [formula] of X by the essentially same definition as above.

Under our assumption [formula], where τ:S  →  S denotes the antipodal map τ(q) =  - q.

Note that [formula] is a compact real-analytic subset only with ordinary singularities as singularities. For any compact real-analytic subset in L only with ordinary singularities as singularities, the irreducible decomposition is possible. Therefore, M is an irreducible component of [formula], and we can recover M from [formula].

There exists an open dense smooth real-analytic subset V of [formula] such that for every point q∈V there exists a point p∈M such that

q is a normal vector of M in S at p, and

p is a normal vector of [formula] in S at q.

Moreover, there exists an open dense smooth real-analytic subset U of M such that for every point p∈U there exists a point q∈V satisfying the same conditions 1 and 2 above.

Choose arbitrarily a pair (q,p) of a smooth point [formula] and a smooth point p∈M satisfying conditions 1 and 2, and fix it.

The second fundamental form of M at p in the normal direction q

[formula]

and the second fundamental form of [formula] at q in the normal direction p

[formula]

are defined. We set

[formula]

[formula] (orthogonal direct sum)

[formula] (orthogonal direct sum)

[formula] (orthogonal direct sum)

Let [formula] be an orthogonal normal basis of [formula]. The matrix [formula] is the inverse matrix of [formula].

Proposition [\ref=dense] is the most difficult part to show in our theory. Once we obtain Proposition [\ref=dense], it is not difficult to deduce Theorem [\ref=duality] applying analogous arguments in complex projective algebraic geometry. Theorem [\ref=duality] and Theorem [\ref=second] can be shown through computation on Maurer-Cartan forms. Theorem [\ref=second] seems to have a lot of applications in theory of subvarieties in a sphere.

Hyperbolic case

We can consider similar situations in hyperbolic case. (Obata [\cite=obata;gauss].)

Let L be a vector space of dimension N + 1 over the real field [formula] as in Section [\ref=sphere]. Now, we consider a non-degenerate inner product (  ,   ) on L with signarutre (N,1). By S we denote one of the two connected components of the set {a∈L|(a,a) =  - 1} in L. The hyperbolic space S has dimension N.

Also in this case we consider a compact real-analytic irreducible subvariety M in S only with ordinary singularities as singularities.

Let [formula]. Note that also [formula] is a smooth real-analytic connected variety with dimension N. However, [formula], and the metric on [formula] is not definite. We can define the dual variety [formula] of M as a subset of [formula] by the essentially same definition as above. The dual variety [formula] of [formula] can be defined as a subset of S.

Proposition [\ref=dense] and Theorem [\ref=second] hold also in this case without any modification. Theorem [\ref=duality] is replaced by the following brief theorem:

In hyperbolic case under our assumption [formula].
