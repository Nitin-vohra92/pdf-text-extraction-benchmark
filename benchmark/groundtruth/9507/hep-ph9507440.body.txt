The standard model with three families of quarks and leptons has eighteen independent parameters of which ten describe the quark sector. The ten parameters are are the six quark masses, the three mixing angles and the phase angle responsible for CP violation. Eight of the ten parameters are fairly well known. These are the six quark masses and the two mixing angles Sinθ12 and Sinθ23 . The two remaining parameters, Sinθ13, and the CP violating phase, δ, are only poorly determined. It is a challenge to construct a fundamental theory of quark masses and their mixings. In the absence of such a theory, specific form of mass matrices have been put forward in the literature. The specific form of quark mass matrices with less than ten parameters are by now all have been ruled out by the recent CDF bound on the mass of the top quark, mt  =  174   ±   17 GeV. We present a specific form of quark mass matrices(1) in which em there are only two non-vanishing elements along the diagonal and the other non-vanishing elements are those due to nearest neighbour interactions. In order to limit the number of free parameters, each mass matrix has is taken to be hermitian. This implies that each matrix is thus described by four real elements and two complex phases. Further, since the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is a product of two unitary transformations, it is only the relative phases that are important. This limits the overall number of parameters to just ten. Explicitly, the mass matrices are

The matrices Mu and Md can be expressed in the generic form [formula] where

[formula]

The eigenvalues (m1, - m2,m3) of [formula] are related to the mass parameters of [formula], i.e., m1 - m2 + m3 = C + D , m1m2m3 = A2C and m1m2 - m1m3 - m2m3 = CD - A2 - B2.

The orthogonal matrix [formula] that diagonalises [formula] is determined to be The matrices u and d that diagonalise the up-type and the down-type quark mass matrices Mu and Md are are gotten by substituting (m1 = mu,m2 = mc,m3 = mt) and (m1 = md,m2 = ms,m3 = mb) in [formula]. The Cabibbo-Kobayashy-Maskawa matrix VCKM is constructed out of the [formula]'s and the phase matrices P's in the usual way, i.e ., VCKM  =  uTPudd , [formula] = diag(1,e- iδ1,e- iδ2), δ1  =  αu  -  αd and δ2  =  αu  -  αd  +  βu  -  βd . Note that the phase combination [formula] involves only the relative phase difference . Hence there are only two fundamental observable phases in the scheme.

The only free parameters in VCKM of our model are Du, Dd, δ1, δ2 as the six quark masses are now known. We require that the matrix elements of VCKM of our model lie within one standard deviation of those determined in the standard model. This requires that Du = 1524  ±  225 MeV, [formula]MeV, δ1  =  π / 2 or 3π / 2 while δ2 is not constrained. The phase angles are constrained further by comparing the CP violating invariant measure J of our model with that of the standard model. The invariant measure J in the standard model has the constraints, 5.0 X 10- 5  ≤   J ≤   1.1 X 10- 4 for mt around 180 GeV. For these values of J, the phase angle δ of the standard model is constrained to lie between 500 ≤   δ ≤   1500. We used four different combinations of the matrix elements of VCKM of our model to construct J, i.e, J=ImV*udVusVcdV*cs, J=ImV*cdVcsVtdV*ts, J=ImV*udVubVtdV*tb, J=ImV*usVubVcsV*cb and explicitly verified the invariance of J. We also found that agreement between the predictions of our model to lie within one standard deviation of the experimentally determined central values constrain the phases δ1 and δ2 to lie close to 3π / 2, a situation that corresponds to maximal CP violation. Thus our final constraints on the four parameters of our model are Du = 1524  ±  225 MeV, [formula]MeV, δ1  ≈  3π / 2 and δ2  ≈  3π / 2. It is to be noted that δ1  =  δ2 = 3π / 2 correspond to an infinite number of solutions for the phase angles αu,αd,βu,βd.
