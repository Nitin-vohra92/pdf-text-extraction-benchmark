Calculation of the Density of States Using Discrete Variable Representation and Toeplitz Matrices

The evaluation of the density of states has been widely discussed for various physical systems in condensed matter and chemical physics [\cite=burke] [\cite=rt] [\cite=ho]. In particular, one is interested in the exsistence of resonances, and their position and width. In the field of chemical physics, resonances play a role in electron-atom, and atom-molecule scattering processes, autoionization, associative detachment, dissociative atachment, and similar molecular resonant reactions [\cite=burke] [\cite=tay1]. Recently, the subject of resonant tunneling in semiconductors double-barrier structures has also been the subject of a feverish activity [\cite=rt], due to the technological interest of the properties of such structures, e.g., negative differential resistance and bistability in current-voltage response.

The common methods for finding the position of resonances are the complex scaling method [\cite=ho] and the stabilization method [\cite=tay1] [\cite=tay2]. The complex scaling method, pioneered by the works of Aguilar, Balsve and Combes [\cite=abc], and Simon [\cite=bs] involves the analytic continuation of the energy into the complex plane using the transformation r  →  reiθ, through diagonalization of the scaled (non-Hermitian) Hamiltonian. The following complex eigenvalues correspond to the resonant states, where the real part is the resonance energy, and the imaginary part is the life-time. The method was modified and extensively used by Certain, Moiseyev and co-workers [\cite=cer], and has been recently applied to three body problems [\cite=lip]. However, this method does not give the full density of states as a function of energy. Only an approximated form can be obtained through the sum of the Breit-Wigner functions of each resonance.

The stabilization method was developed in quantum chemistry for problems involving electron-atom and electron-molecule scattering. The basic idea is to repeatedly diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the basis sets of ever larger extension L, from what is believed to be the region where the resonance wave-function is localized. The result is a stabilization diagram of the eigenenergies Ej(L) vs. L (See an example on Figure 1). The characteristic plateaus which contain the pattern of avoided crossings between stable (with respect to L) and unstable eigenvalues, where the former correspond to the eigenvalues representing resonances, and the latter to discretized continuum states. Briefly, the explanation of this method is the folowing [\cite=mr]. The wavefunctions for energies near the resonant energy are highly localized, and thus are very well described by the finite L2 states. Therefore, they are stable with respect to changes in the range of the basis functions. In contrast, eigenvalues far from resonance correspond to extended states, and feel the modifications of the basis set. Thus, they will vary as L changes.

Some methods have been suggested to derive the resonance parameters from the stabilization method [\cite=sim] [\cite=bsd] [\cite=mr2]. More recently, Mandelshtam et al [\cite=mand1] have shown how the full density of states can be obtained using some kind of averaging over the parameter L. This method has been used for dissociative photoabsorbsion problems [\cite=mand2], for the calculation of microcanonical and canonical rate constants for one-dimensional [\cite=mand3] and three-body collinear problems [\cite=hel], and for resonant tunneling-times calculations [\cite=porto]. A comparison of the above two methods is given in Ref. [\cite=ryb]

However, one would like to have a more direct way to calculate the density of states, without applying analytic continuation methods, or (somewhat artificial) averaging processes. For instance, the textbook definition of the density of states is

[formula]

where H is the Hamiltonian, and G is the (full) outgoing Green's function defined via G(E) = (E + iε  -  H)- 1. A clear and simple derivation would be the evaluation of the Green's function through the inversion of the matrix representing the operator E - H in some L2 basis set. Unfortunately, this naive approach is not directly applicable, since the physical systems in which resonant states occur are, in nature, of infinite extent, and accordingly, the matrices involved are infinite. A solution for this problem was given by Seideman and Miller [\cite=sm] who applied the method of negative imaginary potentials as absorbing boundary conditions [\cite=nip] to deal with the infinite asymptotes.

In this Letter, we present an alternative approach for the above problem. We manage to invert the infinite matrix E - H without applying to any truncations (as done in the stabilization method) or imposing unphysical boundary condintions. This is accomplished using the discrete variable representation (DVR) [\cite=olddvr] [\cite=dvr] [\cite=cm] in which the asyptotic parts are well separated from the interaction region. It has been already recognized [\cite=jcp] that the asymptotic part of this matrix has a Toeplitz structure [\cite=toep]. This structure is here used to reduce the problem into the inversion of a finite matrix whose dimesion is proportional to the width of the interaction region. The only parameter in this method is the spacing σ between successive grid points of the DVR. We apply the method to two double barrier problem, with parameters set corresponding to typical mesoscopic resonant tunneling and chemical reaction problems respectively.

The essence of our method is employing the finite range of the potential through the separation between the asymptotic regions and the interaction region. In order to keep this separation, a localized basis set is desirable. Apparantly, The most appropriate representation from this point of view is the DVR, in which the potential operator is diagonal. The representation of the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian is calculated through the infinite order grid point representation of the second derivative, and is (for equally spaced grid) of the form [\cite=cm]

[formula]

where m is the mass. The corresponding Green's function is thus given through

[formula]

where the points xn = nσ are the basis grid points. We use in the following only the outgoing Green's function, and thus E has to be understood as E + iε.

We now look at the perturbative representation of G

[formula]

where

[formula]

In the following, we use a block-form in which the vectors (which correspond to wave-functions) are represented by 3-dimensional super-vectors whose first (third) component correspond to the left (right) asymptotic part of the vector (and is therefore an infinite-dimensional vector), and its second component correspond to the interaction region (and is thus finite-dimensional). Accordingly, the matrices are represented by 3  ×  3 super-matrices. In this notation, the potential- matrix can be written as (we use bold letters for super-matrices elements, to stress that these are matrices themselves)

[formula]

Similarily, one can write the operator G0V as

[formula]

Since this matrix has a zero (first and third) coloumns, so does all its powers. One thus may write

[formula]

where the [formula] operators are the identity operators of the appropriate order for each block.

It is easy to see from the definition of S, that it satisfies the equation

[formula]

Explicit multiplication, and comparing term by term, gives the following relations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The solution of these relations is given by

[formula]

and consequently [formula] are given by Eqs. ([\ref=sola]),([\ref=solc]). Note that the matrix [formula] is finite and thus its inversion is a simple numerical problem.

Using ([\ref=dyson]), the trace of G is easily obtained. One has

[formula]

The evaluation of the second trace involves simply a finite summation; however, the two other traces are infinite sums. We will show now that using the explicit form of G0 these sums can be reduced to finite ones.

For this purpose we now calculate the DVR form of G0. By definition,

[formula]

where T stands for the kinetic energy operator. Using DVR, the matrix E - T has the structure of a Toeplitz matrix, i.e., (E - T)ij  =  ti - j, where

[formula]

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are thus given by

[formula]

[formula]

where q is a continuous index in the region -  π < q < π [\cite=cac]. The inverse matrix is thus given by

[formula]

where α2  =   - (σk)2 - iε, and k is the wave number corresponding to the energy E. The integrand is highly peaked around q = |α|, and therefore, whenever |α| < π and this peak is inside the integration region, one can extend the integration region to infinity, and obtain

[formula]

where θ  =  σk. The condition θ  <  π means that the number of grid points per (free) wavelength is >  2. This is a relatively sparse grid with respect to those which are used in usual DVR applications.

The free particle density of states per unit length is obtained from ([\ref=g0]),

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=g0]) in ([\ref=g]), the infinite sums reduce to geometric serieses, and one obtains the formula

[formula]

where n0 (n1) is the first point of the left (right) asymptotic region. Thus, after inverting the matrix [formula], all that one has to do is to sum according to Eq. ([\ref=final]).

As an example, we consider here a (symmetric) double barrier structure, typical to the problems treated in mesoscopic resonant tunneling problems [\cite=porto]. The potential is of the form

[formula]

The parameters used are V0  =  0.5eV, x0  =  50A and α  =  4  ×  10- 3A- 2 (corresponding to a quantum well of width ~  60A, with barriers of width ~  40A). The mass is m*  =  0.041me, corresponding to the Ga0.47In0.53As well. Figure 1 shows the full density of states, as calculated form Eq. ([\ref=final]). The resulting lineshape is a Lorenzian centered at E0  =  0.101180eV whose half-width is Γ / 2 = 1.77127  ×  10- 3eV. Figure 2 presents the same graph for the same potential with set of parameters suitable for a chemical physics problem, i.e., V0 = 0.5eV, x0  =  0.2A, α  =  50A- 2 and m = mp. The resulting lineshape is a Lorenzian centered at E0  =  0.3059235eV whose half-width is Γ / 2 = 3.99496  ×  10- 3eV.

In conclusion, a direct and exact method for the calculation of the density of states for localized-potential systems was derived. The method evaluates the inverse of the matrix representing the operator E - H in the DVR, employing its asymptotic Toeplitz structure. As usual in DVR treatments, no integration is needed in constructing the matrix elements. The numerical effort needed involves only the inversion of one matrix (for each energy) whose dimensionality is proportional to the range of the interaction region. We have considered an explicit example of a one-dimensional double barrier structure, typical to those considered in the field of resonant tunneling. However, the derivation is completely general and can be applied also to more complicated (e.g.,three-body, three dimensional) problems.
