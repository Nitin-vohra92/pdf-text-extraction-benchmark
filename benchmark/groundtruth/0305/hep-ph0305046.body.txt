Introduction

The KamLAND experiment [\cite=kamland] has confirmed that the solar neutrino deficit--for a recent review see Ref. [\cite=goswami]--is explained by neutrino oscillations [\cite=pontecorvo], with matter effects [\cite=MSW] playing a decisive role. Whereas the solution of the solar neutrino problem, the large mixing angle MSW solution, displays a large but non-maximal mixing angle θ12 [\cite=goswami], the atmospheric neutrino problem with mixing angle θ23 requires sin 22θ23  >  0.92 at 90% CL, with a best-fit value sin 22θ23  =  1 [\cite=SK].

There are many models and textures in the literature which attempt to explain large (not necessarily maximal) atmospheric neutrino mixing--for reviews see Ref. [\cite=reviews]. However, the closer the experimental lower bound on sin 22θ23 comes to 1, the more urgent it becomes to find a rationale for maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing. Arguments have been given [\cite=nussinov] [\cite=wetterich] [\cite=king] that in this case a non-abelian symmetry is required--for models along this line see, for instance, Refs. [\cite=GL01] [\cite=ohlsson] [\cite=ma] [\cite=kitabayashi].

In this letter we propose a model which employs a discrete non-abelian symmetry group G with eight elements. The essential ingredients of this model are the seesaw mechanism [\cite=seesaw] and a pair of scalar gauge singlets χ1,2 in a two-dimensional irreducible representation of G. Neutrino mixing stems solely from the Majorana mass matrix MR of the right-handed neutrino singlets νR. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of χ1,2 generate off-diagonal elements of MR, and atmospheric mixing turns out maximal. It is essential for our model that the VEVs of the scalar singlets be at the (large) seesaw scale. The present model has some similarities with the model of Ref. [\cite=GL01], where part of the symmetry group is given by the non-abelian group O(2) [\cite=GLsu5].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=particle] we introduce the multiplets of the model and in Section [\ref=group] we discuss the horizontal symmetry group G. The Yukawa sector, the VEVs of the scalar singlets, and the neutrino masses and mixings are presented in Sections [\ref=yukawa], [\ref=vev], and [\ref=massmatrix], respectively; in Section [\ref=mutau] we digress to explain how mμ  ≪  mτ may be achieved in a technically natural way in the context of our model. After discussing some of the predictions of the model in Section [\ref=phen], we come to the conclusions in Section [\ref=concl].

Particle content and symmetries

Our model has three lepton families, including three right-handed neutrinos. We generically denote e, μ, and τ by α. Thus, we have three left-handed lepton doublets Dα, three right-handed charged-lepton singlets αR, and three right-handed neutrino singlets ναR.

In the scalar sector, we employ three Higgs doublets φ1, φ2, and φ3, together with two neutral singlets χ1 and χ2. For the sake of simplicity we shall assume the singlets to be real.

We introduce three symmetries of the [formula] type:

[formula]

[formula] flips the signs of all multiplets of the τ family and [formula] makes a transposition of the multiplets of the μ and τ families. The auxiliary symmetry [formula] serves the purpose of allowing for mμ  ≠  mτ while preserving the appropriate form of the neutrino mass matrix Mν, as we shall see soon. The auxiliary [formula] is equivalent to the one employed in the model of Ref. [\cite=GL01], whose charged-lepton mass generation is identical with the present one.

The group

The symmetries [formula] and [formula] do not commute, and together they generate a non-abelian group G with eight elements:

[formula]

where e is the identity element, and g and h satisfy

[formula]

The group G has five inequivalent irreducible representations:

[formula]

The [formula] is the only faithful irreducible representation. It is obvious that [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula] transform as [formula], while φ3 is a +  -.

The irreducible representations of the group G have a single non-trivial tensor product:

[formula]

From the [formula] we read off that G can be thought of as a group of symmetry operations in the plane comprising rotations with multiples of [formula] and reflections at the x and y axes and at the axes obtained by rotating the coordinate axes by an angle of [formula]. This group is isomorphic to the crystallographic point group D4 [\cite=cornwell].

Yukawa couplings

The Yukawa Lagrangian determined by the multiplets and symmetries defined in Section [\ref=particle] is given by

[formula]

where [formula]. With VEVs [formula] (j  =  1,2,3), one obtains [formula] and

[formula]

Also, the neutrino Dirac mass matrix is

[formula]

The smallness of the electron mass me is correlated with the smallness of the neutrino masses, since me is proportional to [formula] while the neutrino masses are, through the seesaw mechanism, proportional to [formula].

Note that [formula] represents the electroweak scale.

There is also a Majorana mass term

[formula]

Since in our model the charged-lepton mass matrix and MD are both diagonal, the lepton mixing matrix has to result exclusively from MR. Indeed, non-zero VEVs of χ1,2 will render MR non-diagonal. Furthermore, examining the Lagrangians of Eqs. ([\ref=Y]) and ([\ref=majorana]), we find accidental [formula] symmetries [formula] and [formula], defined in analogy to [formula], cf. Eq. ([\ref=symm]):

[formula]

The properties mentioned in this paragraph are reminiscent of the maximal-atmospheric-mixing model of Ref. [\cite=GL01]. The [formula] symmetries of the present model correspond to the U(1)Lα lepton-number symmetries of Ref. [\cite=GL01]; in the neutrino sector, the former symmetries are spontaneously broken by the VEVs of χ1,2 leading to non-diagonal contributions to MR, as we shall see in the next sections, whereas the lepton-number symmetries of Ref. [\cite=GL01] are softly broken by the matrix elements of MR. We further remark that, through a change in the basis used for the representation [formula] of the group G, one can construct a model completely equivalent to the present one, where atmospheric mixing originates in the charged-lepton sector and solar mixing originates in the neutrino sector.

The VEVs of the scalar gauge singlets

We write these VEVs as

[formula]

with W  >  0. In the scalar potential V the χ-dependent terms compatible with the symmetries of Eq. ([\ref=symm]) are

[formula]

where μ, ρj (j  =  1,2,3), η, λ, and [formula] are constants. This potential is similar to the ones used in Ref. [\cite=babu]. Note that a term [formula] is implicitly contained in V. Thus, γ is determined by the minimization of

[formula]

Provided [formula] and the coefficient of cos 2γ is smaller than the coefficient of cos 22γ by, at least, a factor of 2, the minimum of f is at

[formula]

According to the seesaw mechanism [\cite=seesaw], we assume that [formula]. Then, [formula] is very small. From now on we shall make the simplifying assumption that

[formula]

Corrections to this relation are of order [formula], i.e. they are suppressed by the square of the ratio of electroweak over seesaw scale.

The potential in Eq. ([\ref=pot]) is invariant not only under the [formula] symmetries of Eq. ([\ref=symm]), but also under the accidental symmetries of Eq. ([\ref=acc]).

A possible mechanism for mμ / mτ  ≪  1

The muon and tau masses are given by Eq. ([\ref=masses]). We find nothing wrong with the finetuning needed for obtaining mμ  ≪  mτ, since an analogous finetuning is also needed in other models, in particular in the Standard Model. Yet, one could argue that in this case we do not simply have to choose one parameter to be small, rather we have to choose two products of unrelated quantities such that in mμ those two products nearly cancel.

In order to give a natural reason why mμ  ≪  mτ, we may add to our model the following additional symmetry:

[formula]

This symmetry yields

[formula]

In this way the finetuning is confined to the VEVs:

[formula]

One may show that a potential V which is invariant under T, in addition to the symmetries of Eq. ([\ref=symm]), will in general allow for vacua which do not break T spontaneously, i.e. in which the VEVs of φ02 and φ03 are identical. Indeed, if we write

[formula]

with u1 and u real and non-negative (u21  +  u2  =  v2 / 2), and σ belonging to the first quadrant without loss of generality, we find that there is a range of the constants in the scalar potential for which α  =  β and σ  =  π  /  4, i.e. v2  =  v3. Thus, it is possible to obtain mμ  =  0 by imposing the symmetry T and by not allowing it to be spontaneously broken.

Now, in order to obtain mμ  ≠  0 but small compared to mτ, it is enough to introduce a soft breaking of T in the scalar potential. It is easy to see that the only possible term breaking T softly--but keeping intact the other symmetries of the theory, in particular the ones in Eq. ([\ref=symm])--is

[formula]

in which [formula] is a real coupling constant with dimensions of squared mass, which may naturally be assumed to be much smaller than v2. It is then easy to show that in the vacuum one gets [formula], i.e. [formula], hence 0  ≠  mμ  ≪  mτ.

Thus, in the context of our model, and contrary to what happens in many other models, in particular in the Standard Model, it is possible to introduce a natural mechanism, operating through a softly broken discrete symmetry, for mμ  ≪  mτ.

The neutrino mass matrix

With Eqs. ([\ref=Y]), ([\ref=majorana]), and ([\ref=VEVchi]) it is straightforward to write down the Majorana mass matrix of the right-handed neutrino singlets:

[formula]

Using the seesaw formula [\cite=seesaw]

[formula]

for the Majorana mass matrix of the light neutrinos, it follows readily from the [formula] invariance of MD and MR--see Eqs. ([\ref=MD]) and ([\ref=MR]), respectively--that Mν has the structure [\cite=GL01]

[formula]

Maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and θ13  =  0 immediately follow from this structure of Mν--see, for instance, Ref. [\cite=lam]--since that matrix has an eigenvector (0,1, - 1)T. In our model, the form of Mν is a consequence of the non-abelian symmetry group G. The solar mixing angle is not fixed by the mass matrix of Eq. ([\ref=Mnu]), but without finetuning it will be large and non-maximal [\cite=GL01].

More specifically, the symmetric matrix of Eq. ([\ref=Mnu]) is diagonalized by a unitary matrix V as

[formula]

where the light-neutrino masses m1, m2, and m3 are real and non-negative by definition. The matrix V is decomposed as

[formula]

where [formula] is the solar mixing angle and [formula], [formula] are diagonal phase matrices. The above-mentioned eigenvector of Mν appears as the third column of U. We assume, without loss of generality, that θ belongs to the first quadrant while m2  >  m1. The solar mass-squared difference is [formula]. The physical Majorana phases are [formula] and [formula]; the other phases in V, notably the phases in the matrix [formula], are unphysical.

Phenomenological consequences of the model

Our model does not allow for a fully general matrix MR, since it requires [formula], cf. Eq. ([\ref=MR]). A short calculation shows that this condition is rewritten as

[formula]

This relation allows one to express

[formula]

the effective mass probed in neutrinoless ββ decay, in terms of the neutrino masses:

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=cond]) also states that, in the complex plane, it is possible to draw a triangle with sides of length sin 2θ  /  m1, cos 2θ  /  m2, and 1  /  m3. Therefore, the sum of any two of these numbers must be larger than, or equal to, the third one. One such inequality is

[formula]

Since we have chosen the convention m2  >  m1, it follows from Eq. ([\ref=ineq1]) that m3  ≥  m1. Thus, our model requires a neutrino mass spectrum with m1  <  m2  <  m3. The remaining two triangle inequalities are summarized as

[formula]

We can rewrite Eq. ([\ref=ineq2]) in the form

[formula]

where we have identified Δm231  =  m23  -  m21 with the atmospheric mass-squared difference [formula].

Since θ is large and [formula], it is clear that Eq. ([\ref=ineq3]) always holds for [formula]. Thus, our model allows for a quasi-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum. As a matter of fact, Eq. ([\ref=ineq3]) is satisfied either when m1 is larger than a certain value of order [formula], or when m1 is in the vicinity of a certain value of order [formula] for which the right-hand side of that inequality vanishes. For the sake of concreteness, let us take the best-fit values [formula] [\cite=SK] and [formula], tan 2θ  =  0.44 [\cite=goswami]. Then, we obtain from Eq. ([\ref=ineq3]) that either

[formula]

or

[formula]

The value of [formula] increases monotonically with increasing m1. For the lowest m1 in the range of Eq. ([\ref=iutyp]) one obtains [formula]. This value is too low to be within the range of sensitivity of the forthcoming experiments on neutrinoless ββ decay--for a review see Ref. [\cite=vogel]. However, for the range of m1 in Eq. ([\ref=r2]), we have the lower bound [formula], which is not far from future experimental sensitivity.

In our model all the Yukawa-coupling matrices are diagonal. In the low-energy sector, where the effects of χ1,2 are given solely by their VEVs and their respective contributions to MR, the only source of lepton-flavor violation is neutrino mixing. Denoting the scale of the right-handed neutrino masses, i.e. the seesaw scale, by mR, it has been shown in Ref. [\cite=GL02] that in such a theory, in the limit mR  →    ∞   and in the case of two or more Higgs doublets, the lepton-flavor-changing neutral-scalar vertices do not vanish, i.e., there is no decoupling in the Yukawa sector in that limit; the non-vanishing one-loop corrections are generated by charged-scalar exchange and by the mixing of the heavy neutrinos. On the other hand, all the lepton-flavor-changing processes which have either photon or Z exchange, or proceed via a box diagram, are completely negligible, since their amplitudes are suppressed by 1 / m2R, and thus decouple in the above limit. Processes which are mediated by neutral-scalar exchange and remain unsuppressed by inverse powers of mR are τ±  →  μ±μ+μ-, τ±  →  μ±e+e-, τ±  →  e±e+e-, and μ±  →  e±e+e-. Their branching ratios have been estimated [\cite=GL02] to be of order [formula], where Y is a typical Yukawa coupling, GF is the Fermi constant, and M0 is a typical mass of the five "light" physical neutral scalars in our model. Using the reasonable values 16π2GFM20  ~  10 and Y  ~  10- 2, such branching ratios are of order 10- 18 [\cite=GL02]. However, due to the proportionality to Y8, a slight increase in Y could easily bring the branching ratio for μ±  →  e±e+e- close to the sensitivity range of future experiments.

Conclusions

In this letter we have discussed an extension of the Standard Model in the lepton sector which employs a horizontal non-abelian discrete symmetry group G. With respect to the Standard Model, the new multiplets are three right-handed neutrino singlets, which allow the use of the seesaw mechanism, two additional Higgs doublets, and two real scalar gauge singlets χ1,2. The G-multiplets are such that all the Yukawa-coupling matrices of the Higgs doublets are diagonal. Before χ1,2 acquire VEVs, the mass matrix MR of the right-handed neutrino singlets is diagonal as well. Thus, non-trivial lepton mixing originates in [formula]. Maximal atmospheric mixing and the vanishing of the mixing angle θ13 are linked to [formula]. We have shown that the scalar potential following from G-invariance allows such a relation among the VEVs of the scalar gauge singlets, apart from corrections suppressed by (v / W)2, where v≃ 246 GeV. If W is of the order of the seesaw scale, then these corrections are completely negligible. It is, consequently, also natural that the physical scalars associated with χ1,2 have masses of similar order of magnitude. Due to the form of the neutrino mass matrix in Eq. ([\ref=Mnu]), the solar mixing angle is free, but large and non-maximal if we do no employ finetuning.

Since there are two scales in the scalar potential of our model, the electroweak scale and mR, the scale of the right-handed-neutrino Majorana masses, the model suffers from the naturalness problem associated with radiative corrections to the masses of the light scalars. Those masses receive radiative corrections of order m2R. A high level of finetuning is required in order to eliminate those large radiative corrections through renormalization. A possible solution to this problem, without destroying the nice features of the model, might be supersymmetrization.

Our model requires a neutrino mass spectrum with m1  <  m2  <  m3. In addition, there is a lower bound on m1 of about [formula], if we use the best-fit values for the solar mixing angle and for the mass-squared differences [formula] and [formula]. Neutrinoless ββ decay is not necessarily within the sensitivity range of future experiments, but it may well be, cf. Eq. ([\ref=r2]). Among lepton-flavor-violating processes, the same applies to the decay μ±  →  e±e+e-, while μ±  →  e±γ is strongly suppressed; lepton-flavor violation is just the same as in the model with soft lepton-flavor breaking of Refs. [\cite=GL01] [\cite=GL02].
