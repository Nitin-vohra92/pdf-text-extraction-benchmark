n-point Gravitational Lenses with 5(n - 1) Images

An n-point gravitational lens is an algebraic extension of the systems of masses whose gravitational effect is linear such that its lensing effect is given by the following lens equation here written in terms of complex variables.

[formula]

where ω is the position of the light source and the total mass is normalized to 1 so that εj is the fractional mass of the point lens located at xj. The number of images is the number of solutions for z. Since the number of solutions of the equation changes where the Jacobian determinant of the equation vanishes, the so-called critical curve where the Jacobian determinant vanishes (J(z,) = 0) consist of closed curves and the images are referred to as positive or negative images depending on the sign of the J value. Since the lens equation is "almost analytic" (the derivatives are analytic), it is easier to handle the following κ function. The critical condition is given by |κ|  =  1.

[formula]

It is worth emphasizing that the Jacobian determinant is bounded by 1. One immediate implication is that positive images (J  >  0) are never demagnified (|J|- 1  ≥  1). Where J = 1 is where the family of J =  constant contours contract to points, and the limit points can be found by solving κ = 0. Since [formula] is an 2(n - 1)-order analytic equation, there are always 2(n - 1) (finite) limit points but they can be degenerate. If we let zj  =  rj exp iθj and rewrite the equation 0  =  κ,

[formula]

it is clear that the limit points are where the Newtonian forces (1 / r2) due to the lens masses balance out and it corroborates why the images at the limit points are neither magnified nor demagnified (|J| = 1). It also makes it easy to guess the rough positions of the limit points in relation to the positions of the lenses. (The limit points can be considered 2-d Lagrange points.) For two masses, imagine the line that connects them, and the limit points are on both sides of the line closer to the smaller mass. For three masses, consider pairwise and their interactions, etc.

It has been known in the cases of n = 2 and n = 3 that the discrete limit points can be the positive image positions of a source and in fact the source generates the maximal number of images 5 and 10. It has been also found that the (n + 1) limit points of a set of n equal masses equally spaced on a circle can be the positive image positions of a source at the center of the circle when the radius of the circle is properly chosen. If the radius of the circle is a and one mass is on the positive side of the real axis, the lens equation is given by z  =  n where

[formula]

One limit point of degeneracy (n - 2) is at the center and is an image. The other limit points are on a circle of radius [formula] and are images when [formula]. Let's note that the limit points configuration is azimuthally shifted by π / n in comparison to the configuration of the lens positions while both the angular distances between two neighboring lens masses and two neighboring limit points are 2π / n.

[formula]

If we consider lines that go through the center, limit points and the lens positions define n lines separated by π / n. If n is odd, then on each line lie one lens mass and two limit points one of which is at the center. On the real line, in the order of increasing coordinate values, they may be represented as {  *    *  X} where *   and X denote limit points and lens positions respectively. If n is even, we need to consider two neighboring lines. For example, the real line contains two lens positions and one limit point: {X  *  X} and the neighboring line rotated by π / n from the real line contains two limit points: {  *    *  }. The limit points are image positions if

[formula]

In order to find negative images, we need to solve the lens equation [formula].

For odd n ~ (  ≥  3), it suffices to consider the equation on the real line: z  =  Fn. There is always one solution at z = 0 and that is the positive image at the limit point. The other solutions satisfy the following.

[formula]

This equation has three solutions: one on the positive real axis and two on the negative real axis. That is because h(z+)h(z-)  <  0 where z± are the two solutions to[formula].

[formula]

The factor in the last parenthesis monotonically decreases with n but remains positive. It is 2 for n = 2 and converges to (3 - e)  ≈  0.28 as n  →    ∞  . One of the solutions on the negative real axis is the limit point [formula] and so a positive image. The sequence of images and lens positions in the increasing order of the coordinate values is [formula] where [formula] denotes the positions of negative images. In the case of n = 3, the negative image solutions are at [formula]. Their J values are ( - 2) and the well-known sum rule works out: [formula]. The inverse Jacobian of the two negative images and the limit point at [formula] cancel out, and the total is given by the value of the limit point at the center. That is not the case for n  >  3.

For even n ~ (  ≥  4), the real line has only two (negative) images because h(z+) = h(z-) and so h(z+)h(z-)  >  0. The sequence of images and lens positions is given by [formula]. On a neighboring line, we set [formula] and find two solutions: [formula].

Now we add a small mass nε at the center. The thought is that dropping in a lensing mass that defines the position of a pole (J  =    -    ∞  ) at the current limit point that defines a zero (κ = 0 or J = 1) should alter the "topographic structure" of the image plane defined by the function J drastically enough to change the number of images but should be perturbatively traceable by keeping the mass small.

[formula]

If z is an image of the ring lens configuration, [formula], then we look for solutions z + η that are images of the new configuration with an extra mass in the lowest but sufficient order in η: [formula].

The limit point equation near the center shows n limit points near the center.

[formula]

The radius |η| depends on one n-th power of the small mass [formula] and one can say that the original limit point is split into n new limit points. The total number of limit points increases by (n - 1) to (2n) as expected for non-degenerate limit points of a (n + 1)-point lens.

In order to investigate the positions of the images, let's consider the real line first. Near the center, the lens equation becomes [formula] and two new images are formed.

[formula]

If n is odd, the image on the positive real axis (in the direction of the lens position with respect to the center) is a negative image and the image on the negative real axis is a positive image. The new positive image is in fact facilitated by the new limit point on the negative real axis found in equation ([\ref=eqNewlimit]). We should note that the new positive image is not at the position of the new limit point but in the "positive domain" newly defined by the new limit point. If n is even, the both are negative images, which is to be expected because the lens masses (where J =  -   ∞  ) are along the real line.

When n is even, lens axes (lines through lens positions and the center) and "limit point axes" (lines through limit points and the center) are separate as we discussed. The set of "limit point axes" is rotated by π / n from the set of lens axis. It is simple to find that there are two positive images along each "limit point axis".

[formula]

The images and limit points away from the center shift their positions slightly but their counts and parities remain the same. The positive images depart from the limit point positions. Off-center limit points move toward the center with increasing [formula]. Images move away from the center. Thus, the effect of the small (n + 1)-th mass [formula] added to the center is to increase the number of the limit points from (n + 1) to (2n) and to increase the number of images by (2n - 1) from (3n + 1) to (5n).

In conclusion, we have shown via explicit constructions that the maximum number of images of the n-point gravitational lens is no less than 5(n - 1). It has been suspected that 5(n - 1) is in fact the maximum based on the maximum number of discrete limit points 2(n - 1). We mentioned above an evident correlation between new positive images and new limit points. If the number of positive images is bounded by the number of (finite) limit points ([formula]) as we conjectured, then the total number of images can not exceed 5(n - 1) because of the relation between the numbers of positive and negative images. It still remains to find an abstract analysis to confirm that the maximum number of positive image domains of a caustic domain is bounded by the maximum number of the limit points. Of course, refutation has not been ruled out, but we recommend not to bet on it.
