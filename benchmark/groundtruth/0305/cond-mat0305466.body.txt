Disorder induced collapse of the electron phonon coupling in MgB2 observed by Raman Spectroscopy

Since the discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 in January 2001 [\cite=Nagamatsu] a large volume of work has been directed towards developing and improving the quality of MgB2 thin films [\cite=Uedarev]. The temperature of the onset of superconductivity (Tc) in these films has varied considerably, although there is no consensus on the mechanism behind the Tc suppression. Nonetheless, theoretical models suggest that a two band superconductivity model is needed to explain the high Tc in MgB2 [\cite=Kortus] [\cite=Mazin] [\cite=Liu] [\cite=Brinkman]. As inter-band scattering increases due to impurities in the boron layer, so the two gaps in MgB2 are predicted to converge into one gap with Δσ  =  Δπ = 4.1 meV [\cite=Brinkman]; this transition is predicted to occur as the Tc is suppressed below 25 K [\cite=Brinkman]. Measurements of the phonon energies in YBa2Cu3O7 - δ helped the understanding of the relation between the crystal structure and the Tc in this material [\cite=Gibson]. Therefore, similar measurements made on MgB2 films with different Tcs may help to elucidate the mechanisms behind the suppression of the critical temperatures in MgB2, while casting light on the nature of the two band superconductivity.

Numerical calculations indicate that in MgB2 there are two phonon modes involving vibrations along the c-axis (A2u and B1g) and two doubly degenerate modes with vibrations only in the ab plane (E1u and E2g) [\cite=Yildirim]; for the P6mmm space group to which MgB2 belongs, only the E2g mode is Raman active [\cite=Kunc]. Predictions for the frequency of the E2g mode vary between 515 cm- 1 (64 meV) [\cite=Kortus] and 665 cm- 1 (82 meV) [\cite=Satta], while experimental studies have shown a broad Raman mode between 600 cm- 1 and 630 cm- 1 [\cite=Kunc] [\cite=Postorino] [\cite=Goncharov] [\cite=Bohnen] [\cite=Chen] [\cite=Hlinka] [\cite=Meletov] [\cite=Quilty2] [\cite=Rafailov]. The consensus is that this mode is the E2g mode, however, there remains controversy about this assignment [\cite=Kunc] [\cite=Chen], with Kunc et al. [\cite=Kunc] concluding that this mode was due to a "contaminant phase at the sample surface". In this letter Raman spectroscopy has been used to characterise the quality of MgB2 films both in terms of impurity phases and disorder. The effects of a suppressed Tc on the phonon mode at ~  600 cm- 1 were studied. Both magnesium stoichiometry and oxygen contamination may play a role in determining the Tc [\cite=Eom] [\cite=Serquis]. It has been shown previously that as-grown films of MgB2 can have significant magnesium concentration gradients through the thickness of the film [\cite=Jo]. This effect is equally likely where a precursor boron film has been annealed in magnesium vapor. Therefore, measurement of the superconducting properties of a post-annealed boron film through the thickness of the film would give an indication as to the effect of magnesium stoichiometry on the Tc.

The films used in this study were prepared by two different techniques to produce films with different Tcs. The samples were either grown by DC magnetron sputtering from separate Mg and B targets onto c-sapphire substrates at room temperature, followed by an anneal at varying temperatures and times with the substrates face down on the heater [\cite=Nadia], or they were produced by ex-situ annealing of evaporated boron films in magnesium vapor [\cite=Koreans]. X-ray analysis showed that the ex-situ annealed films had c-axis orientation [\cite=Koreans] however, no evidence of any orientation was found in the sputtered films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated that over the sputtered films there was little change in crystallite size with the average crystallite measuring ~   100 nm. In comparison, the ex-situ films had an average crystal size less than 100 nm. An ex-situ annealed boron film of nominal thickness 500 nm and Tc of ~  39 K was then formed into a staircase structure with step heights of ~  30 nm by a standard lithography technique followed by broad-beam Ar ion milling (500 V, 1 mA cm- 2 beam), shown schematically in the inset to Fig. [\ref=Armill]. Raman spectra taken before and after the first milling process did not show any appreciable effect due to the milling process or the aqueous photoresist developer used and so the effects of the patterning process were taken to be negligible.

Raman spectra were taken using a Renishaw Ramascope 1000 with an Ar ion laser at 514nm at room temperature. The laser spot size was 3μm x 3μm. In order for the background removal to be systemmatic across the series, the background removal method of Postorino et al, was used [\cite=Postorino] which is fully described in [\cite=Postorino] and references therein. Error bars on the phonon frequency were estimated from fitting several spectra from different parts of the same film and calculating the standard deviation. Resistance data were taken by a normal four point contact technique. The Raman spectra of films with Tc  ~  38 K could be fitted well by a broad (FWHM ≃180 cm- 1) Lorentzian curve centred at 611 cm- 1, with some evidence of secondary peaks at 400 cm- 1 and ~   700 cm- 1, previously associated with disorder in the structure of the MgB2, [\cite=Postorino] [\cite=Rafailov], see Fig. [\ref=spec]. Figure [\ref=spec]b shows the Raman spectrum of a film with a Tc of 12.5K, where the frequency of the main mode has decreased to ≃535 cm- 1. There is also evidence of additional, higher frequency contributions, the origins of which are unknown but may include contributions from B2O3 and will be discussed in a future publication.

The main panel of Fig. [\ref=Tcplot] shows the frequency of the E2g mode as a function of Tc. As the Tc of the films decreases from 38 K to 22 K, the frequency of the E2g mode decreases from 615 cm- 1 to ~  600 cm- 1, values similar to the range reported in [\cite=Kunc] [\cite=Postorino] [\cite=Goncharov] [\cite=Bohnen]. As the Tc of the films is suppressed below 20 K, there is a sudden large drop in the frequency of this mode from 600 cm- 1 to 540 cm- 1 (7 meV) over an 8 K drop in Tc. The inset to Fig. [\ref=Tcplot] shows the resistivity as a function of temperature in two films of very different onset Tc.

Figure [\ref=Armill] shows the frequency of the E2g mode through the thickness of the film L1. The frequency of this mode drops in the first 150 nm of the surface of the film from 611 cm- 1 to ~  600 cm- 1 whereupon it stays approximately constant throughout the film thickness. The dependence of the E2g mode on the Tc indicated in Fig. [\ref=Tcplot] is again seen in the staircase film. RT data was taken on the staircase film by means of wire bonding contacts to each individual step and measuring the voltage drop across each step individually, in sequence, as a function of temperature. Resistance vs temperature measurements indicated a region of activated transport immediately above the superconducting transition temperature across the second and third thinnest steps, reminiscent of some of the films with depressed Tcs both in Fig. [\ref=Tcplot] and in the literature, see for example [\cite=Eom].

The strong dependence of the frequency of the mode detected at around 600 cm- 1 on the Tc of the film suggests that an internal mechanism is at work for the suppression of Tc in these films and would appear to rule out this mode being a surface contaminant. In order to understand the relationship between the phonon frequency and the Tc, the McMillan formula [\cite=McMillan] may be used:

[formula]

where, following the method of ref. [\cite=Kortus] we have taken [formula] with 717 and 435 being the phonon frequencies of other modes in the MgB2 system taken from ref. [\cite=Osborn]. μ* is the Coulomb pseudopotential, taken as equal to 0.13 [\cite=Brinkman], and λ is the electron phonon coupling constant. For single crystal (Tc = 38K) MgB2, λσσ=1.29 [\cite=Cooper]. Taking these values and ωE2g = 620 cm- 1 gives Tc = 43 K. For the films of lower Tc a lower value of λ must be used if the Tc found from Eq. 1 is to agree with that found experimentally. In films of high Tc with little interband scattering, the effective coupling parameter is given by the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix given by the interaction parameters multiplied by the density of states in that band [\cite=Liu]. For MgB2 this is closer to λσσ than to λππ [\cite=Liu]. However, in the limit of strong interband scattering, so the effective coupling parameter becomes a weighted average over all of the bands [\cite=Golubov2] and is therefore reduced. Although the use of the McMillan formula using an average value of λ has been questioned [\cite=Choi], it has been used successfully in other studies where a higher value of λ is used [\cite=Kortus] [\cite=Loa]. A simple average gives λ = 0.458, which leads to a Tc (ωE2g = 540 cm- 1) of 1.6 K. If, instead, a value of λ = 0.80 is taken a much better fit is obtained to the data, see Fig. [\ref=ther]. The data may be fitted very well assuming λ is 1.22 for the high Tc films and 0.80 for the films with lower Tc. Although the model used is simple and hence accurate determination of the electron phonon coupling cannot be assumed, the results roughly correspond with those obtained via the de Haas van Alphen effect [\cite=Cooper]. Particularly important though is that the electron phonon coupling must drop substantially at ≃ 19 K, indicating that a fundamental change to the nature of the superconducting state is occuring. Such a shift in the value of the electron-phonon coupling would be expected if the superconducting state became isotropic and the two gaps merged into one superconducting gap. The point at which this occurs may be estimated from the point at which the data can be fitted by a lower range of λ. Comparing Fig. [\ref=ther] with Fig. [\ref=Tcplot] indicates that this occurs at Tc = 19±  1 K, in satisfactory agreement with the predicted value of 25 K [\cite=Brinkman] and excellent agreement with the 19 K value given by Choi et al. [\cite=Choi] and Mazin et al, [\cite=MazinPhysC].

The Tc data from the thick film made into a staircase structure indicate that the physical mechanism behind the Tc suppression may be in part attributable to magnesium stoichiometry. An additional factor that may arise particularly in the lower Tc films is that of oxygen alloying into the MgB2 film [\cite=Eom]. As well as changing the lattice parameters and, therefore, the phonon frequencies, an additional effect of oxygen alloying into the boron plane would be to introduce defects into the boron layer thereby causing the increase in interband scattering which leads to the collapse of the two gaps into one [\cite=Kortus] [\cite=Liu] [\cite=Mazin] [\cite=Brinkman]. It is therefore possible that the reduction of Tc in this region is caused by such a mechanism with the frequency of the E2g mode reflecting the presence of the oxide impurities within the boron layers. Although the Raman spectrum of an MgxByOz compound is unknown, a symptom of such alloying may be the presence of B2O3 in the grain boundary regions [\cite=Klie]. Taking the ratio of the intensity of the 808 cm- 1 B2O3 mode [\cite=RamanB2O3] to the ≃600 cm- 1 mode of MgB2 gives an indication as to the relative abundance of the two compounds. As the Tc drops, the ratio of oxide to MgB2 content increases, however, such analysis needs very careful consideration as no work has yet been done on the intensity of the 600 cm- 1 mode as a function of structure and it is not unfeasible that it is varying independently of the amount of oxide in the film.

In conclusion, we have shown that the mode at ~  600 cm- 1 in MgB2 is strongly correlated with the Tc which would support the hypothesis that this mode is the sought after E2g mode in MgB2. Raman spectra taken as a function of thickness through a thin film allowed a prediction of a Tc drop between the surface layer and the substrate layer which was later observed by transport data taken across the film. The reduction in Tc observed in MgB2 was attributed to a mixture of magnesium off-stoichiometry and oxygen alloying into the boron layers. However, on its own, the drop in frequency of the phonon mode is not enough to explain the drop in Tc that is observed. Such a decrease may only be explained if the electron phonon coupling constant changed abruptly between 19 and 25 K from λ ≃ 1.22 for films with Tc  >   19K to λ ≃ 0.8 for Tc  ≤   19K, consistent with the expected transition from a two gap superconductivity in MgB2 samples with high values of Tc to one in which there is only one, isotropic, superconducting gap for samples that have high interband scattering and a reduced value of Tc.
