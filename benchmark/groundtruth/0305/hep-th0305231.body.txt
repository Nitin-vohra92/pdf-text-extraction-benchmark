Introduction

Compact Einstein spaces with positive-definite metrics have been studied extensively: first, the spaces are considered as candidates of compact internal spaces which are admitted in higher-dimensional gravitational theories[\cite=Duff]; and secondly, the spaces are expected that they may dominate the path integrals of quantum gravity[\cite=EQG].

There are many examples of homogeneous Einstein metrics to be found in a lot of literature, but they are very exceptional among general Einstein spaces. In contrast, the inhomogeneous Einstein metrics would cover wide range, but our knowledge for them seems to be largely limited. The first example of inhomogeneous compact Einstein space which is a solution to the Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant,

[formula]

was constructed by Page[\cite=rotating] by taking a limit of the Euclidean Kerr-de Sitter solution, and it was generalized by Bérard-Bergery[\cite=BB].

In the absence of any general understanding of the solution to the Einstein equation [\eqref=Einstein_eq], one of the standard strategies for constructing inhomogeneous examples is to study the space with cohomogeneity one metric: the space admits a Lie group action by isometries whose orbits span the space with codimension one. It is considered that the space which foliates into a sequence of homogeneous subspaces of codimension one. The Einstein equation for such metric reduces to a set of non-linear second order ordinary differential equations[\cite=W].

It is possible to replace the homogeneous subspaces by spaces with bundle structure. This idea originates from the Kaluza-Klein construction. The Einstein equation translates into a coupled system of equations involving the Ricci curvatures of the fibers and base space, as well as the curvature of the connection. When we have a suitable choice for the bundle space and connection, the Einstein equation also reduces to a set of the ordinary differential equations.

In this paper, we construct compact inhomogeneous examples of the Einstein metric with a positive cosmological constant in 4n+4 dimensions on the spaces with bundle structure. More precisely we consider the union of principal SO(3)-bundles P over Quaternionic Kähler manifolds, so our spaces may be identified locally with I  ×  P for some interval I of the real line. This geometrical setting was studied in [\cite=PP1] and they constructed a family of inhomogeneous compact Einstein spaces. Our construction is a generalization of their system[\cite=PP1] [\cite=PP2] [\cite=GPP].

In this framework, it is possible to take three types of boundary conditions at two endpoints of I for completeness, i.e., two types of bolt singularities associated with the Quaternionic Kähler manifold and with its twistor space respectively, and the nut singularity describing S4n + 3-collapsing. We find new compact Einstein spaces which have the two types of bolts, numerically. The new solutions together with the known solutions give a unified description of compact Einstein spaces with a positive cosmological constant.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains our Kaluza-Klein metric ansatz and calculations of the Riemannian curvature. In section 3 we derive the Einstein equation after a short review of Quaternionic Kähler manifolds. We also prove the diagonalizability of the metric using the technique for the 4-dimensional Bianchi IX metric. In section 4, we discuss the boundary conditions and give asymptotic solutions near the boundaries. In section 5, known exact solutions are listed. In section 6 we present new solutions obtained by numerical integrations. Section 7 is devoted to summary and discussion.

Metric Ansatz and Curvature Calculation

In this section, we shall consider metrics on (m + 4)-dimensional manifolds [formula]. To make the analysis manageable, we assume the following geometrical condition for [formula]. Let π:P  →  M be a principal SO(3)-bundle over an m-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M,gM) and φ be an SO(3)-connection on P. The connection φ locally takes the form

[formula]

Here, A is an so(3)-valued local 1-form on M and s- 1ds is considered as the Maurer-Cartan form. Let φi be the components of φ for the standard basis {Ei} of so(3) which satisfies the Lie bracket relations [formula]. By using the left-invariant 1-forms σi defined by [formula], the equation [\eqref=eq:connection] can be also written as

[formula]

with the adjoint representation

[formula]

In this setting we consider metrics on [formula] which is locally the product space I  ×  P, where I denotes some interval of R. Given a metric bij on SO(3), the Kaluza-Klein metric takes the form

[formula]

We can show that the matrix bij(t) is diagonalizable for all t under a certain condition of the base space M  (see a proposition in section 3). Thus we write the metric as

[formula]

If we impose the condition a = b = c, then the metric [\eqref=eq:metric] has an isometry SO(3). Otherwise it has no such symmetry because of the explicit dependence on the group element Oij.

Now, we choose an orthonormal basis êa  =  {ê0,  êi,  êα  ;  i = 1  ~  3,  α = 1  ~  m} for [\eqref=eq:metric],

[formula]

where (ai) = (a, ~ b, ~ c) and eα is an orthonormal basis for gM. Then, the spin connection ab defined by [formula] is calculated as

[formula]

where [formula] is the curvature 2-form of A and ωαβ is the spin connection on M. The curvature 2-form [formula] is given by the following equations:

[formula]

where Ωαβ is the curvature on M and DγFkαβ is the gauge covariant derivative of F,

[formula]

The remaining components ij (i,j = 1  ~  3) are

[formula]

and 23,  31 are given by cyclic permutations 1  →  2  →  3  →  1. The non-zero components of Ricci tensor R̂ab become

[formula]

Here Rαβ denotes the Ricci tensor on M and RSO(3)ij the Ricci tensor on SO(3). Explicitly the non-zero components of RSO(3)ij are given by

[formula]

Einstein equation based on Quaternionic Kähler Manifold

In order to solve the Einstein equation, we need a further assumption on the base space M of the principal bundle P. Then we will obtain a generalization of the ordinary differential equations studied in [\cite=PP1] [\cite=PP2] [\cite=GPP].

Let (M,gM) be a 4n-dimensional Quaternionic Kähler manifold (QK manifold). It has a set of three almost complex structures Ja(a = 1  ~  3) which satisfy the quaternion algebra

[formula]

and one can find local 1-forms Ai such that

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the Levi-Civita connection[\cite=ishihara]. According to [\cite=GP], we introduce an orthonormal basis with 2-indices {eμi};

[formula]

Then the 2-forms Ja are given by

[formula]

Furthermore, the SO(3)-connection [formula] is c1-self-dual in the sense of [\cite=GP], i.e., the Yang-Mills curvature [formula] satisfies the following self-dual equation

[formula]

with c1 = 6n / (2n + 1)! . We note that the connection A automatically satisfies the Yang-Mills equation like a 4-dimenional ordinary instanton. In fact

[formula]

where we have used dΩ = 0 by [\eqref=eq:qk2] and the Bianchi identity DF = 0. It is known that any QK manifold is Einstein and F simply takes the form[\cite=ishihara][\cite=Salamon]

[formula]

where λ is the Einstein constant for the metric gM.

Now let us turn to the evaluation of the Ricci tensor [\eqref=eq:ric]. From QK geometry, we saw that the SO(3)-connection A is c1-self-dual and its curvature satisfies the quaternionic relations. Thus, when we take a 4n-dimensional QK manifold as the base space with self-dual connection, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

These equations finally lead us to the (4n+4)-dimensional Einstein equation with a cosmological constant Λ:

[formula]

Here, if we impose the conditions a = b = c  ≠  f and a  ≠  b = c = f ~ , then [\eqref=eq:ein] yields the equation studied in [\cite=PP1] and [\cite=PP2], respectively (see section 5). Also the singular reduction [formula] and b = c gives the (4n + 3)-dimensional Einstein equation discussed in [\cite=GPP]. In case of the trivial bundle P = M  ×  SO(3), i.e., A = 0, the Ricci tensor [\eqref=eq:ric] directly yields the Einstein equation without the assumption of QK manifolds. This equation is simply given by dropping the f- 4 terms and replacing the dimension 4n by arbitrary one in [\eqref=eq:ein].

It is worth noting that the 8-dimensional Einstein equation with vanishing Λ is special in the sense that the Spin(7) holonomy condition leads to the following first-order equations[\cite=Hitchin] [\cite=CGLP5];

[formula]

We can verify by substituting [\eqref=eq:spin7] into [\eqref=eq:ein] with n = 1 that the metric is indeed Ricci-flat, and the explicit solutions were constructed in [\cite=GPP] [\cite=CGLP5] [\cite=BS] [\cite=CGLP3].

Finally we prove the following as mentioned in section 2 :

Proposition   Let (M, ~ gM) be a 4n-dimensional QK manifold with c1-self-dual connection. Then the Kaluza-Klein metric [\eqref=eq:ometric] for the Einstein space can be put in the diagonal form [\eqref=eq:metric] for all t.

Proof.   We calculate the Ricci tensor for the metric [\eqref=eq:ometric], and the result is given in Appendix A. Note that the off-diagonal component R0i takes the same form as the 4-dimensional Bianchi IX type cosmological model. So this enables us in the usual way (see [\cite=Bogo], for example) to diagonalize the metric for all t . The argument is based on an important property of the Einstein equation, namely invariance under the right action of SO(3). Indeed, using the corresponding transformation of the connection

[formula]

we can diagonalize the fiber metric bij at an initial time t = t0. Then the Einstein equation R0i = 0 leads to [formula] for i  ≠  j at t = t0, which implies the diagonality of the solution for all time.

Boundary Condition

In this section, we discuss boundary conditions for the Einstein equation [\eqref=eq:ein]. Let us assume the following compact conditions of ≃I  ×  P :

I is the closed interval

[formula]

Furthermore we require that the singularities at the boundaries t1 and t2 are resolved by bolts or nuts; there are three types of resolutions, nut ↔   nut,  bolt ↔   nut and bolt ↔   bolt (see Fig.1). This means that near the boundary P is locally of the form

[formula]

where the radius of round k-sphere Sk tends to zero at the boundary and the [formula]-dimensional manifold [formula] remains non-vanishing. We find there are three choices of the manifold [formula] consistent with the Einstein equation: (B1) QK manifold M ([formula]=4n), (B2) twistor space Z of the QK manifold ([formula]=4n+2), (B3) empty. In the case of (B1) or (B2) the singularity can be resolved by bolt, we call these singularities QK-bolt and T-bolt, and the case (B3) by nut. We summarize these boundary conditions as follows :

QK-bolt

[formula]

gM denotes a metric on a QK manifold M.

T-bolt

[formula]

gZ denotes a metric on a twistor space Z ,

[formula]

which shows Z is an S2-bundle over M, and the metric is Kähler-Einstein for α = 1.

nut

[formula]

Here we have translated the boundary t = t1 or t2 to the origin t = 0, and α  ~  , β and k are free parameters. In the case (B3) the QK manifold is required to be HP(n), otherwise it yields the curvature singularity at the boundary t = 0 ~  since it does not describe the S4n + 3-collapsing (nut singularity). On the other hand, in the cases (B1) and (B2) the manifold [formula] would have an orbifold singularity at t = 0 ~  though arbitrary QK manifolds are allowed. Indeed, [formula] represents the metric on SO(3)≃S3 / Z2  ~   rather than SU(2)≃S3 , and the range of the angle Θ = kψ (φ1 = dψ for the fixed twistor space coordinate) does not mean 0  ≤  Θ  <  2π generally. For the case (B1), if we choose the QK manifold HP(n) , then the orbifold singularity disappears by lifting to an SU(2)-bundle (see section 5) .

Using the Einstein equation we find the following asymptotic behavior of the metric near the boundary:

QK-bolt

[formula]

Here three of f0 ~ , ~ a3 ~ , ~ b3 and c3 are free parameters which satisfy the relation

[formula]

and the remaining coefficients are determined by them.

T-bolt

[formula]

where k  ,  b0  ,  f0 are free parameters and the remaining coefficients are determined by them. The cases k = 2 and 1 / N for a positive integer N are exceptional and the expansion above must be modified by the following equations :

1.  k = 2

[formula]

where b0  ,  b1  ,  f0 are free parameters and remaining coefficients are determined by these.

2.  k = 1 / N

[formula]

where b0  ,  f0  ,  δN = b2N - c2N are free parameters and remaining coefficients are determined by these. Derivation of [\eqref=ex3] is viewed in Appendix B.

nut

[formula]

where a3, ~ b3, ~ c3 and f3 are parameters satisfying a3 + b3 + c3 + 4nf3  +  Λ / 2 = 0 ~ .

Example

The quaternionic projective space HP(n) is a typical example of QK manifolds. The Hopf fibration [formula] is a principal SU(2)-bundle over HP(n). It has a natural connection such that its horizontal space is the orthogonal complement to the fiber with respect to the standard metric on S4n + 3. This connection is c1-self-dual[\cite=Naga] and in case of n = 1 the connection is the well-known BPS instanton.

We explicitly calculate the Kaluza-Klein metric based on [formula] according to sections [\ref=ch:2] and [\ref=ch:3]. For the base space M=HP(n), the standard metric is written as

[formula]

where xA = xA0 + xA1i + xA2j + xA3k ~  ~ (A = 1  ~  n) are quaternionic coordinates and x̄A are their conjugates. Then the c1-self-dual connection takes the form

[formula]

Thus we have a Kaluza-Klein metric [\eqref=eq:metric] on I  ×  P explicitly, and the Einstein equation is given by [\eqref=eq:ein].

By the construction P is an SO(3)-bundle over HP(n). In general, there is an obstruction to lifting an SO(3)-bundle over QK manifold to an SU(2)-bundle, i.e., the Marchiafava-Romani class ε. A result of [\cite=Salamon] says that ε = 0 if and only if the QK manifold is HP(n), and so in this case the total space P lifts to the covering space P̃ as an SU(2)-bundle. Actually P̃ is the total space of the Hopf fibration, S4n + 3≃Sp(n + 1) / Sp(n).

For completeness we present a summary of the known compact complete metrics based on the Hopf fibration. All these metrics are given as solutions to appropriate reductions of our equation.

reduction to one variable ; a = b = c = f

[formula]

with Λ = 4n + 3 ~ . This solution, which obeys the boundary condition [\eqref=eq:b3] at t =   ±  π / 2 ~ , represents the standard metric on  = S4n + 4  ~  .

reduction to two variables ; a = b = c and f An explicit solution is given by

[formula]

with Λ = 4n + 12 ~ . This solution, which obeys [\eqref=eq:b1], [\eqref=eq:b3] at t = 0,  ~  π / 2, respectively, gives the standard metric on [formula]. Another solution satisfying [\eqref=eq:b1] at the both endpoints was constructed numerically. It gives a metric on an S4-bundle over [formula], i.e., [formula][\cite=PP1]. The case n = 1 has been analytically established by B[formula]hm[\cite=bohm].

reduction to two variables ; a and b = c = f The situation is very parallel to (R2), but the topology is different as we will see shortly. The Fubini-Study metric on CP(2n + 2) belongs to this class. Explicitly, the metric is written as

[formula]

with Λ = 4n + 6 ~ . This solution obeys the boundary conditions [\eqref=eq:b2], [\eqref=eq:b3] at t = 0 ~ ,π / 2 ~ , respectively. In this case the general solution was constructed by Page-Pope[\cite=PP2] as

[formula]

where

[formula]

with integration constants mi (i=1,2). Its special case satisfying [\eqref=eq:b2] at the both endpoints gives a metric on an S2-bundle over the twistor space Z, i.e., [formula] .

New Solutions

The solutions listed in the previous section have two of three possible boundaries at the endpoints: (B1) QK-bolt, (B2) T-bolt and (B3) nut. Correspondence between the solutions and boundaries is schematically shown in Fig.2. No solution is found which connects QK-bolt and T-bolt though the existence is naturally expected from the Fig. 2. The solutions with QK-bolt are found in the ansatz (R2), and the solutions with T-bolt are in the other ansatz ([formula]), then we search new solutions which connect QK-bolt and T-bolt under a generalized ansatz in which the metric has three unknown variables.

We assume b = c, hereafter, and treat a,b,f as unknown metric functions of t. From [\eqref=eq:ein] we obtain the evolution equations

[formula]

Taking a combination of [\eqref=eq:ein] we also get the Hamiltonian constraint

[formula]

We should integrate the equations [\eqref=dyn-eq] from QK-bolt at t = t1 = 0 as an initial value problem in t. Since a and b are zero at t = 0, the set of ordinary differential equations [\eqref=dyn-eq] is singular there. To deal with the singularity, we use the asymptotic form of the solutions [\eqref=asympt-QK] near the singularity, and start numerical integrations at an initial time t = ti = 0 + ε, where ε is a small amount of time duration.

Equation [\eqref=asympt-QK] gives the asymptotic behavior of a,b and f near QK-bolt:

[formula]

where f0, ~ a3 and b3 satisfy

[formula]

and f2 is given by

[formula]

Introducing a parameter g0 by

[formula]

we can solve ([\ref=const-cond-B1]) as

[formula]

Therefore, the initial condition at t = ti is given by [\eqref=asympt-B1] [\eqref=f2] and [\eqref=param-B1] with t = ε. We have two free parameters f0 and g0 to specify the initial condition near QK-bolt.

We are interested in finding solutions for which b and f stay positive and finite, and a returns to zero at some moment t = t2. At this point the set of equations [\eqref=dyn-eq] becomes singular again. We assume that this singularity is resolved by T-bolt [\eqref=eq:b2]. If k  ≠  1 the cone-type singularity appears at t = t2 so we set k = 1 for regularity. Then the condition [\eqref=ex3] with b = c (δ1 = 0) shows that the asymptotic behavior of a,b and f near t = t2 should be

[formula]

where 0 and 0 are free constants and ā3,2 and 2 are described by them as

[formula]

We stop numerical integrations at tf = t2  -   ([formula] is a small constant) and check whether the values of a,b,f and [formula] agree with [\eqref=b2-a]-[\eqref=b2-f].

Here, we define

[formula]

where

[formula]

A solution for [\eqref=dyn-eq] defined on the region

[formula]

Summary and Discussion

In the present work, we have made an investigation of higher dimensional compact Einstein manifolds. We can view such manifolds as the union of principal SO(3)-bundles over Quaternionic Kähler manifolds. Globally, our compact manifold [formula] is considered as a fiber bundle associated with a principal G-bundle P, i.e.,  = P  ×  GF  (G = SO(3) or SU(2)) . The fiber F is a 4-dimensional manifold (orbifold) with the Bianchi IX metric on which G acts with cohomogeneity one, and the base space M is the Quaternionic Kähler manifold.

Total space [formula] can be regarded as an evolution of P over a finite time segment

[formula]

Appendix A

In this appendix we calculate the Ricci tensor of the off-diagonal metric [\eqref=eq:ometric] . When we use the basis φi  (i = 1  ~  3) for the fiber metric and the orthonormal basis ê0  ,êα    (α = 1  ~  m) defined by [\eqref=eq:o.n.b] , the non-zero components are

[formula]

Here [formula] and RSO(3)ij denotes the Ricci tensor on SO(3) ;

[formula]

When we impose the assumption of 4n-dimensional QK manifolds (see section 3) , then R̂iα = 0 and the explicit dependence of the group element Oij disappears from the equations,

[formula]

which yields the SO(3) invariance of the Einstein equation.

Appendix B

Putting y = b - c, and then using the Einstein equation [\eqref=eq:ein] we obtain

[formula]

where the coefficients p and q are given by

[formula]

Taking account of the expansion [\eqref=ex1], we approximate the equation [\eqref=asymp] in the limit t  →  0,

[formula]

which has the regular solution y = t2N for a positive integer N. Thus we conclude that the expansion takes the form of [\eqref=ex3].

Appendix C

Let us consider [formula] case, where cone-like singularity appears at T-bolt. The angle around T-bolt is 2πk then the singularity is angular deficit for k < 1 and angular excess for k > 1. In this case, solutions make a family parameterized by k. A curve on the (f0,g0)-plane depicted in Fig. 5 shows a family of solutions.
