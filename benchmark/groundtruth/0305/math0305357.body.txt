A note on the ampleness of numerically positive log canonical and anti-log canonical divisors

Shigetaka Fukuda

Every variety is defined over the field of complex numbers throughout the paper. Let X be an n-dimensional nonsingular projective algebraic variety and [formula] a reduced simply normal crossing divisor on X (where Δi is a prime divisor). We denote the canonical divisor of X by KX. Thus KX  +  Δ denotes the log canonical divisor on the pair (X,Δ).

By the symbol κ(X,L), we mean the Iitaka dimension of a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor L.

A [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor L on X is numerically positive (nup ([\cite=LaRo]), for short) if (L,C)  >  0 for every curve C on X.

In the case where dim X  =  1, the nupness means the ampleness.

In this paper we deal with the following four conjectures, which are well known to the specialists of higher dimensional algebraic varieties.

Conjectures [\ref=C1] and [\ref=C2] are theorems in dimension n  ≤  3, by virtue of the abundance and the log abundance theorems (due to Kawamata [\cite=Ka87] and [\cite=Ka92], Miyaoka [\cite=Mi] and Keel-Matsuki-McKernan [\cite=KeMaMc]). Conjecture [\ref=C3] was proved by Hidetoshi Maeda [\cite=MaHd] in dimension n = 2 and by Serrano [\cite=Se] in dimension n = 3.

Hironobu Maeda [\cite=MaHr] proved Conjecture [\ref=C4] in the case where Δ  ≠  0 and n = 2, as follows: Assume that n=2, the anti-log canonical divisor - (KX  +  Δ) is nup and Δ  ≠  0. First we shall show that ( - (KX  +  Δ))2  >  0. Let us derive a contradiction, assuming that ( - (KX  +  Δ))2  =  0. From the nupness of - (KX  +  Δ), we have - (KX  +  Δ)Δ  >  0. Thus - (KX  +  Δ)KX  <  0. Then κ(X, - (KX  +  Δ))  =  1 by virtue of Sakai [\cite=Sa], Theorem 2. Hence the nupness of - (KX  +  Δ) implies that ( - (KX  +  Δ))( - (KX  +  Δ))  >  0, because a high multiple of - (KX  +  Δ) becomes linearly equivalent to some nonzero effective divisor. This is a contradiction! Consequently we have ( - (KX  +  Δ))2  >  0. Next we apply the Nakai criterion to the divisor - (KX  +  Δ) and obtain that it is ample.

By using Wilson's technique [\cite=Wi], Hironobu Maeda [\cite=MaHr] proved Conjecture [\ref=C4] also in dimension n = 3 under the extra condition κ(X, - (KX  +  Δ))  ≥  1. (This result was reviewed by Matsuki [\cite=Ma87].)

Here we remark that Serrano [\cite=Se] has implicitly proved Conjecture [\ref=C4] in dimension n = 3 under the weaker condition that κ(X, - (KX  +  Δ))  ≥  0, as follows: Assume that n = 3, that the anti-log canonical divisor - (KX  +  Δ) is nup and that κ(X, - (KX  +  Δ))  ≥  0. Then κ(X,( - 1)KX + 1( - (KX  +  Δ)))  =  κ(X, - 2(KX  +  Δ)  +  Δ)  ≥  κ(X, - 2(KX  +  Δ))  =  κ(X, - (KX  +  Δ))  ≥  0. Thus Serrano [\cite=Se], Proposition 3.1 implies that - (KX  +  Δ)  +  εKX is ample for a sufficiently small positive rational number ε. Therefore - (KX  +  Δ)  =  (1 / (1 - ε))(( - (KX  +  Δ)  +  εKX) + εΔ) is big. This satisfies the extra condition stated in the preceding paragraph.

Now we state our main theorem

Proof of Theorem [\ref=MT]

We define [formula] and [formula]. We remark that (KX  +  Δ)|Γ  =  KΓ for every [formula].

Let L be a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor on X.

L is said to be nef and log big on (X,Δ), if L is nef, Ln  >  0 and (L|Γ)dim Γ  >  0 for any [formula].

Assume that L is nef.

If bL - (KX  +  Δ) is nef for some b  ≥  0, then so is aL - (KX  +  Δ) for a  ≫  0.

If bL - (KX  +  Δ) is nup for some b  ≥  0, then so is aL - (KX  +  Δ) for a  ≫  0.

If bL - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and big for some b  ≥  0, then so is aL - (KX  +  Δ) for a  ≫  0.

If bL - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and log big on (X,Δ) for some b  ≥  0, then so is aL - (KX  +  Δ) for a  ≫  0.

We cite two lemmas:

We prove this proposition by induction on n. If n = 1, the statement is trivial. Thus we may assume that n  ≥  2.

We note that (aL - (KX  +  Δ))|Δi  =  aL|Δi - (KΔi  +  (Δ  -  Δi)|Δi).

First we shall show that ((aL - (KX  +  Δ))|Γ)dim Γ  >  0 for any [formula]. If (Δ  -  Δi)|Δi  ≠  0, then the induction hypothesis implies that ((aL - (KX  +  Δ))|Γ)dim Γ  >  0 for any Γ  ⊆  Δi. Thus we may assume that (Δ  -  Δi)|Δi  =  0. Then [formula]. Therefore ((aL - (KX  +  Δ))|Δi)dim Δi  >  0.

Next we shall show that (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n  >  0. Assuming that (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n  =  0 for any a  ≫  0, we will derive the contradiction. Then we have Li(KX  +  Δ)n - i  =  0 for [formula], by regarding (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n as a polynomial in the variable a. Thus - KX  ·  (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n - 1  =  ( - aL  +  Δ)  ·  (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n - 1  =  Δ  ·  (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n - 1  ≥  (aL - (KX  +  Δ))n - 1Δi  =  ((aL - (KX  +  Δ))|Δi)dim Δi  >  0. Consequently Lemma [\ref=L1] derives the contradiction.

The assertion follows from Lemma [\ref=L2], because aL - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and log big on (X,Δ) for a  ≫  0 by Proposition [\ref=P].

(1) Put L  =  KX  +  Δ in the statement of Theorem [\ref=STH]. (2) Put L  =   - (KX  +  Δ) in the statement of Theorem [\ref=STH].

(1): Conjecture [\ref=C1] is true in the case n  ≤  3 (Miyaoka [\cite=Mi], Kawamata [\cite=Ka92]). Thus Proposition [\ref=P2] implies the assertion.

(2): Conjecture [\ref=C3] is true in the case n  ≤  3 (Hidetoshi Maeda [\cite=MaHd], Serrano [\cite=Se]). Thus Proposition [\ref=P2] implies the assertion.
