On a sequence related to the Josephus problem Ralf Stephan

In this short note, we show that an integer sequence defined on the minimum of differences between divisor complements of its partial products is connected with the Josephus problem (q=3).

We prove the following theorem and, finally, state the relatedness of two constants.

Let an and bn be recursively defined as

[formula]

The first terms of an and bn are [\cite=S][\cite=Z]

[formula]

We need two lemmata.

For k > 0,

[formula]

This is true for k = 1, and the set of divisors of [formula] is the set of divisors of [formula] plus 2k + 1 and [formula] itself.

Let δ(m) denote the smallest absolute value of the differences between complementary divisors of m > 1:

[formula]

Let us sort the divisors of [formula] by size and call these Dj:

[formula]

Any smallest complementary divisor difference must be the one where the divisors are in the exact middle of the sorted list, which, using ([\ref=p-l1]), is k + 1. And so, [formula].

Now, the proposition ([\ref=p-l2]) is true for k = 1. For every increase of k by one, σ(m) increases by two, and the index of the wanted pair of divisors increases by one, so Dk + 2 - Dk + 1 goes through the values

[formula]

so it doubles every second step which is just the meaning of ([\ref=p-l2]).

Fixing the induction base at δ(p3 = 48) = 21 = 2b3 to make sure that Dk + 2 - Dk + 1 > 1, the main proposition ([\ref=p-t]) is now obvious, since the powers of two in an behave the same way under multiplication as unity does in bn under addition.

Because the asymptotics of bn are known[\cite=C], with the investigation of [formula] is settled, except for the closed form for c. Reble already proved[\cite=R] that bn is connected to the Josephus problem. Independently, our numerics show that

[formula]

with K(3) the universal constant in the same problem with q = 3, a constant already discussed ([\cite=OW][\cite=HH]), and whose closed form is still unknown.
