Abstract: An entirely quantum mechanical approach to diagonalize hermitean matrices has been presented recently. Here, the genuinely quantum mechanical approach is considered in detail for [formula] matrices. The method is based on the measurement of quantum mechanical observables which provides the computational resource. In brief, quantum mechanics is able to directly address and output eigenvalues of hermitean matrices. The simple low-dimensional case allows one to illustrate the conceptual features of the general method which applies to (N  ×  N) hermitean matrices. (Fortschr.

Introduction

A new attitude towards quantum theory has emerged in recent years. The focus is no longer on attempts to come to terms with counter-intuitive quantum features but to capitalize on them. In this way, surprising methods have been uncovered to solve specific problems by means which have no classical equivalent: quantum cryptography, for example, allows one to establish secure keys for secret transmission of information [\cite=bennet+84]; entanglement [\cite=schroedinger35/2] is used as a tool to set up powerful quantum algorithms which do factor large integers much more efficiently than any presently known classical algorithm [\cite=shor95]. Throughout, these techniques make use of the measurement of quantum mechanical observables as an unquestioned tool. This is also true for many (but not all [\cite=aharonov+99]) proposals of quantum error correction schemes [\cite=shor95] [\cite=steane96], required to let a potential algorithm run.

The purpose of the present contribution is to study the simplest situation in which a quantum mechanical measurement, i.e. the bare 'projection' [\cite=schroedinger35/2], "does" the computation. The computational task is to determine the eigenvalues of hermitean (2  ×  2) matrices by quantum means alone. Although the answer to this problem can be given analytically, it is useful to discuss this particular case since there is no conceptual difference between diagonalizing (2  ×  2) or (N  ×  N) hermitean matrices along these lines [\cite=weigert01].

Before turning to the explicit example, consider briefly the traditional view on quantum mechanical measurements: a measurement is thought to confirm or reveal some information about the state of the system. The measured observable Â is assumed to be known entirely, including in-principle-knowledge of its eigenstates and eigenvalues. Further, the observable also defines the scope of the possible results of a measurement since both the only allowed outcomes are its eigenvalues and, directly after the measurement, the system necessarily resides in the corresponding eigenstate.

In the context of quantum diagonalization, however, the crucial idea is to learn something about the measured observable--not about the state of the system. Why is there scope for information gain at all? What can one learn from a quantum mechanical experiment if both the measured observable and the state are known?

It is essential to realize that the input required to measure an observable Â and the output of an experiment, in which Â is actually measured, are not identical. In fact, it is possible to construct an apparatus which measures an observable Â without explicitly knowing its eigenvalues. Then, a measurement provides partial--but explicit--information about the spectral properties of the observable Â: it delivers one of its eigenvalues. As the eigenvalues of Â are not known explicitly before the measurement, information is indeed gained by measuring Â. This is the idea which underlies quantum diagonalization.

The quantum diagonalization of a hermitean matrix is achieved in five steps: (1) express the matrix in a standard form; (2) associate a quantum mechanical observable with it; (3) identify an apparatus capable of measuring the observable; (4) measure the observable--this provides the eigenvalues of the matrix; (5) determine its eigenstates. The next section gives the details for (2  ×  2) matrices. Then, the generalization to (N  ×  N) matrices is briefly summarized.

Quantum diagonalization of hermitean (2  ×  2) matrices

Suppose you want to determine the eigenvalues A± (and, subsequently, the eigenvectors |A±〉) of the general hermitean (2  ×  2) matrix

[formula]

Obviously, this problem is easily solved analytically. The eigenvalues read

[formula]

and one can also give explicit expressions for the eigenvectors of the matrix [formula]. The five-step procedure of quantum diagonalization is now applied to [formula]; it will, of course, reproduce the result ([\ref=twoeigenvalues]). However, all conceptual points, which also apply to the technically more cumbersome case of (N  ×  N) matrices are conveniently illustrated by this simple example.

Standard form of [formula]: Any hermitean (2  ×  2) matrix [formula] can be written as a unique linear combination of the three Pauli matrices [formula] , and the unit matrix [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

From a general point of view, this corresponds to an expansion of [formula] in multipole operators (cf. below).

Identification of an observable: The most general Hamiltonian of a spin-1 / 2 in a homogeneous magnetic field [formula] is linear in the components of the spin [formula]. Therefore, any matrix [formula] has an interpretation as a Hamiltonian operator of a quantum spin subjected to an appropriately chosen magnetic field,

[formula]

The part [formula] shifts the energy globally by a fixed amount. Let E± denote the eigenvalues of the second part of this expression, [formula]; then, the eigenvalues A± of the matrix [formula] are given by

[formula]

Consequently, the door is now open to determine the eigenvalues of [formula] experimentally, i.e. through measuring the eigenvalues E± of the Hamiltonian [formula]. In the next step it is shown how to devise an apparatus which measures this operator.

Setting up a measuring device: The apparatus is required to measure the eigenvalues of the operator [formula]. In the case of a (2  ×  2) matrix this is just a familiar Stern-Gerlach apparatus, appropriately oriented in space. However, as the method will be applied to (N  ×  N) hermitean matrices later on, it is important to go through the construction of the measuring device in detail.

Consider the spatially varying Hamiltonian

[formula]

which describes the interaction of a spin with an inhomogeneous magnetic field [formula]. In order that [formula] measure the observable [formula], the field needs to satisfy the conditions

[formula]

Then, at the centre of the apparatus, the operator [formula] coincides with the observable to be measured, [formula], and the magnetic field is consistent with Maxwell's equations. Consider the field [\cite=swift+80]

[formula]

which is consistent with Eqs. ([\ref=1/2field]) if the vector [formula] is perpendicular to [formula]. Diagonalize the operator [formula] to first order of [formula]. This leads to [formula]-dependent eigenvalues

[formula]

which imply the existence of a state-dependent force

[formula]

Consequently, particles on their way through the apparatus will be deflected deterministically from a straight line once the projection to an eigenstate |E±〉 has occurred. In this way, the eigenvalues of the observable can be accessed experimentally.

Determination of the eigenvalues: If a measurement of the operator [formula] is performed on the state [formula], then it is thrown with probability 1 / 2 into one of the eigenstates |E±〉 with density matrix [formula],

[formula]

Repeating the measurement a few times, both eigenvalues will have been found soon. The probability not to obtain one of the two values after N0 identical runs of the experiment equals 1 / 2N0, and hence goes to zero exponentially with the number of runs. Subsequently, the sought-after eigenvalues A± of the matrix [formula] are known due to the relation ([\ref=evrel]), and the major step in the diagonalization of the matrix has been achieved in a quantum way.

Determination of the eigenstates: Once both eigenvalues A± are known, it is straightforward to to determine the associated eigenstates by a simple calculation. Optionally, one continues along an experimental line. One exploits the fact that the apparatus app([formula]) prepares an ensemble of eigenstates of [formula] with density matrix [formula] if the other subbeam (containing [formula]) is blocked--and vice versa. The Bloch representation of the density matrix [formula], say, can be parameterized by expectation values,

[formula]

Hence, the components of the vector [formula] (and therefore [formula]) are easily obtained by means of a second, appropriately oriented Stern-Gerlach apparatus, which amounts to a reconstruction of the density matrix [formula].

Quantum diagonalization of hermitean (N  ×  N) matrices

Five steps are necessary to diagonalize a hermitean (N  ×  N) matrix [formula] by quantum means.

Standard form of [formula]: Write the hermitean (N  ×  N) matrix [formula] as a combination of linearly independent hermitean multipole operators [formula]

[formula]

Multipole operators [formula] act in a Hilbert space Hs of dimension N = 2s + 1 which carries an irreducible representation of the group SU(2) with the spin components [formula] as generators. They are defined as the symmetrized products [formula] and [formula] after subtracting off the trace, except for [formula], the (N  ×  N) unit matrix. The index a labels (2s + 1) classes with (2a + 1) elements each, transforming among themselves under rotations. Explicitly, the lowest multipoles read

[formula]

For the sake of brevity, a collective index [formula] has been used in ([\ref=expandgen]), taking on the values [formula]. The N2 self-adjoint multipole operators [formula] form a basis in the space of hermitean operators acting on the N-dimensional Hilbert space Hs [\cite=swift+80]. Two multipoles are orthogonal with respect to a scalar product defined as the trace of their product: [formula]

Identification of an observable: Interpret the matrix [formula] as an observable [formula] for a single quantum spin [formula] with quantum number s = (N - 1) / 2,

[formula]

using the expression of the multipoles [formula] in terms of the components of a spin. Since the multipoles are expressed explicitly as a function of the spin components not exceeding the power 2s, it is justified to consider them and, a fortiori, the quantity [formula] as an observable for a spin s.

Setting up a measuring device: Swift and Wright [\cite=swift+80] have shown how to devise, in principle, a generalized Stern-Gerlach apparatus which measures any observable [formula]--just as a traditional Stern-Gerlach apparatus measures the spin component [formula] along the direction [formula]. The construction requires that arbitrary static electric and magnetic fields, consistent with Maxwell's equations, can be created in the laboratory. To construct an apparatus app[formula] means to identify a spin Hamiltonian [formula] which splits an incoming beam of particles with spin s into subbeams corresponding to the eigenvalues An. The most general Hamiltonian acting on the Hilbert space Hs of a spin s reads

[formula]

with traceless multipoles (except for ν = 0), and totally symmetric expansion coefficients [formula]. These functions, which vary in space, generalize the magnetic field [formula] in ([\ref=genhamiltonian]). Tune the corresponding electric and magnetic fields in such a way that the coefficients [formula] and their first derivatives with respect to some spatial direction, r1, say, satisfy

[formula]

As shown explicitly in [\cite=swift+80], this is always possible with realistic fields satisfying Maxwell's equations. Then, the Hamiltonian in ([\ref=genhamiltonian]) has two important properties:

At the origin, [formula], it coincides with the matrix [formula].

Suppose that a beam of particles with spin s enters the generalized Stern-Gerlach apparatus app([formula]) just described. At its center, particles in an eigenstate |An〉, say, will experience a force in the r1 direction given (up to second order in distance from the center) by

[formula]

Consequently, particles with a spin residing in different eigenstates |An〉 of the operator [formula] will be separated spatially by this apparatus. From a conceptual point of view, the procedure is equivalent to the method outlined above for a spin 1 / 2.

Determination of the eigenvalues: Once the apparatus app[formula] has been set up, one needs to carry out measurements on (particles carrying) a spin s prepared in the homogeneous mixture [formula]. The output of each individual measurement will be one of the eigenvalues An of the matrix [formula], according to the 'projection postulate:'

[formula]

In words, the action of the apparatus is, with probability pn = 1 / N, to throw the system prepared in state [formula] into an eigenstate [formula] of the observable Â; the outcome of the measurement is given by the associated eigenvalue An.

After sufficiently many repetitions, all eigenvalues will be known, although the outcome of an individual measurement cannot be predicted due to the probabilistic character of quantum mechanics. It is necessary to repeat the experiment a number of times until all values An have been obtained. Since the spin s has been prepared initially in a homogeneous mixture, [formula], the (2s + 1) possible outcomes occur with equal probability. The probability not to have obtained one specific value An after N0  ≫  N measurements equals (2s / (2s + 1))N0≃ exp [ -  N0  /  2s], decreasing exponentially with N0.

Determination of the eigenstates: As before it is possible to either calculate the eigenstates |An〉 of the matrix [formula] on the basis of the known eigenvalues, or to determine them experimentally by methods of state reconstruction (see [\cite=weigert99/1] for details).

Summary and Outlook

As a result of the five steps just described, a hermitean (N  ×  N) matrix [formula] has been diagonalized without calculating the zeroes of its characteristic polynomial by traditional means. The fourth step solves the hard part of the eigenvalue problem since it provides the eigenvalues An of the matrix [formula]--information which cannot be obtained in closed form if N  ≥  5. One might best describe the measuring device app([formula]) as a 'special purpose machine' which is based on the 'collapse of the wave function' as computational resource. However, one could avoid to use the notion of 'collapse' or 'projection' by characterizing the process indirectly using the concept of 'repeatable measurements' described in [\cite=peres95].

By construction, the quantum mechanical diagonalization is not based on the representation of a mathematical equation in terms of a physical system which then would 'simulate' it. Similarly, no 'software program' runs which would implement an diagonalization algorithm. Therefore, the method resembles neither an analog nor a digital calculation.

t is worthwhile to point out that the quantum mechanical approach to the diagonalization of hermitean matrices is based on the assumption that the behaviour of a spin s is described correctly by non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Note, finally, that quantum diagonalization does not depend on a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics.
