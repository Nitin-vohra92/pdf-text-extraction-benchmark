Pathways to non-sequential multiple ionization in strong laser fields

PACS 32.80.Rm, 32.80.Fb

Introduction

Laser pulses with peak intensities of the order of 1014 W/cm2 and wavelengths in the infrared can ionize several electrons simultaneously [\cite=luk83] [\cite=huillier83] [\cite=boyer84]. Growing experimental evidence [\cite=walker94] [\cite=moshammer00] [\cite=weber00prl] [\cite=weber00jpb] [\cite=weber00n] [\cite=wechenbrock01] [\cite=feuerstein01] [\cite=moshammer02] supports a rescattering process [\cite=corkum93] [\cite=kulander93] as the most likely mechanism for the rapid transfer of a sufficient amount of energy to the electrons. The interaction between the rescattered electron and the others takes place close to the nucleus, leading to the formation of a short lived, highly excited compound state with electrons near to the nucleus. This compound state will decay by emitting a single electron (the most likely decay mode) or several electrons. The highly excited electrons move so quickly that the changes in the field can be neglected: the electrons see an essentially static electric field. Experimental studies of the final momentum distribution for double ionization show that the electron momenta parallel to the field are strongly correlated [\cite=weber00n] [\cite=wechenbrock01] [\cite=feuerstein01] [\cite=moshammer02]. Building on the picture of an intermediate compound state we have proposed a classical origin for the electron correlations [\cite=eckhardt01] [\cite=eckhardt01pra1] [\cite=eckhardt01silap] [\cite=eckhardt01pra2] [\cite=eckhardt01epl]. If the energy of the compound state is above the zero field threshold energy no constraints on the outgoing dynamics are imposed. If the energy is below double ionization can occur only if the field is still present. Then the electrons will aim for the Stark saddle, but the electron repulsion will prevent them from crossing the saddle in the same place at the same time. Furthermore, if one electron is ahead it will push the others back, thus preventing multiple ionization. Therefore, the electrons have to escape in a configuration that balances the mutual repulsion. For two electrons this means that the electrons move side by side with respect to the field axis. Within this symmetric subspace it is easy to identify a saddle which the electrons have to cross on their way to double ionization: it is a stationary configuration of two electrons side by side close to the Stark saddle for a single electron (assuming, as mentioned before, that the field is stationary). The number of saddle configurations increases with the number of electrons: there are two configurations for three electrons, with different energies and different threshold exponents [\cite=eckhardt01pra2].

We here extend our earlier study of such saddle configurations for two and three electrons to four or more. The aim is to identify the possible saddles, their critical energies and their threshold exponents. The number of configurations increases rapidly with the number of electrons. Beginning with five electrons also several nearby almost degenerate saddles appear. Most interestingly, for four and fewer electrons all electrons are equivalent in the dominant mode, but this is no longer true for six or more.

We conclude this introduction with notation and the formulation of the Hamiltonian. Since the electrons escape from the highly excited compound state so quickly, we may assume that the field is constant during the escape. Let the electric field point in the z-direction and let the electrons be labeled [formula] with positions [formula]. Then the Hamiltonian is, in atomic units,

[formula]

Simple scaling shows that the field strength F can be absorbed, so that without loss of generality we can take F = 1 [\cite=eckhardt01pra1] [\cite=eckhardt01pra2].

The aim now is to determine the stationary points of this Hamiltonian, where the derivatives with respect to momenta and positions vanish. For the most part this is not possible analytically. The numerical method of choice is the Newton-Raphson iteration [\cite=numericalrecipes]. The required calculation of the matrix of second derivatives can be turned to an advantage since it allows for an immediate determination of the stability properties of configuration. The main disadvantage of the method, but also of all other numerical methods, is that they do not provide any measure by which to judge whether all solutions have been found. On the practical side we can make sure that we have hit at least all the configurations with large domains of attraction in the Newton-Raphson method by starting with a sufficiently large number of randomly selected initial conditions. We used up to 106 initial conditions. The fact that fairly similar but definitely different configurations could be detected may be interpreted as strong evidence that all configurations have indeed been found.

The stability analysis of the stationary point in the full phase space allows us to determine the behavior of the cross-section for non-sequential escape close to the threshold [\cite=eckhardt01epl]. Among all Lyapunov exponents of the saddle there is one, λr, whose eigenvector components point in the same direction along the field axis: it corresponds to a simultaneous motion of all electrons in the same direction away from the saddle. Borrowing terminology from chemical reactions, we call this subspace the reaction coordinate. Because of the repulsion between electrons all configurations have additional unstable eigenspaces, which enter in the threshold exponent. If the initial energy of the system equals the saddle energy only a trajectory living in the symmetric subspace can lead to a simultaneous escape of all electrons. This reduces the dimensionality of the problem and the cross-section vanishes. For higher energy some deviations from the symmetric motion are possible, giving a finite volume of initial conditions and a non-vanishing cross-section. The dependence of the cross-section on energy σ(E) close to the saddle energy EN can be obtained in the spirit of the Wannier analysis [\cite=wannier53] [\cite=rau84] [\cite=rost98] [\cite=rost01phe], resulting in

[formula]

with an exponent

[formula]

The λi's are the positive Lyapunov exponents of the saddle except for the reaction coordinate exponent λr. The cross section is large if the exponent is small, i.e. if the saddle is crossed quickly (large λr) or if the differences from the symmetric motion grow slowly (small λi). These cross section exponents are an additional characteristic of the multiple ionization process.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section we discuss a few obvious, and highly symmetric configurations. This is followed by our numerical results for up to eight electrons in section [\ref=sec3]. We conclude with a few remarks in section [\ref=sec4].

Symmetric configurations

All electrons on a ring

We assume that all electrons are situated in a plane perpendicular to the field and that they obey a CNv symmetry. The reflection symmetry limits the momenta to be parallel to the symmetry planes and thus confines the motion to a dynamically allowed subspace in the high-dimensional N-body phase space. That is, if in the full phase space of the N-body problem initial conditions are prepared in this subspace they will never leave it. In the symmetry subspace we can use cylindrical coordinates for the electrons, zi = z, ρi  =  ρ and φi = 2πi / N. Then, for zero total angular momentum along the field axis and in the scaled variables where F = 1, the Hamiltonian ([\ref=ham]) can be reduced to

[formula]

with

[formula]

The Hamiltonian ([\ref=hcNv]) possesses a stationary point at pρ = 0, pz = 0, ρ  =  ρN and z = zN where

and

[formula]

The first few saddles with electrons on a ring are shown in Fig. [\ref=symmetric_figure].

For k  ≪  N the repulsion energy W behaves like [formula]. This suggests that W increases like N2 ln N, and indeed numerical evidence supports

[formula]

Since W increases faster than quadratically, the configurations exist for finite N only. Specifically, we find that the energy of the configuration first decreases but then increases again, and that there is no configuration for N = 473 or more particles . The properties of the configurations, including stability and cross section exponents, are listed in table [\ref=symmetric].

One electron in the center

The simplest extension from the symmetric ring is to place one electron on the field axis and the others on a ring as shown in Fig. [\ref=symmetric_w_center_figure]. Such configurations have three characteristic lengths, the radius of the ring ρN - 1, the position of the ring zN - 1 and the position of the electron on the axis zc. No analytical solutions have been found. The numerically determined characteristics are collected in table [\ref=symmetric_w_center].

All electrons on a line

A third class of configurations has all electrons in a plane through the field axis. The electrons are placed like beads on a string. With the confinement of electrons to an almost linear arrangement the saddle energies are higher than in the previous cases and the cross section exponents are also much larger. The properties of the saddles are listed in table [\ref=lineup], and their positions are shown in Fig. [\ref=lineup_figure].

All configurations

A summary of the symmetric configurations discussed in the previous section is provided in Fig. [\ref=summary], which shows the saddle energies for different N. For the range of N included in the figure the saddle energies for all configurations decrease, but as the example of the ring configurations shows, they can be expected to increase for sufficiently large N. There is a crossover in the configuration that gives the minimum, from the ones with all particles on a ring for N < 5 to the ones with a one electron in the center for N > 5. The case N = 5 is marginal (see below). In order to see what other configurations one has to consider, we turn to a discussion of configurations found with the Newton-Raphson method for electron numbers between four and eight. The cases of two and three electrons have been analyzed previously [\cite=eckhardt01] [\cite=eckhardt01pra1] [\cite=eckhardt01silap] [\cite=eckhardt01pra2] [\cite=eckhardt01epl].

Four electrons

For four electrons there are 4 configurations, shown in Fig. [\ref=all_four_fig]. Their properties are listed in table [\ref=all_four]. The dominant non-sequential ionization takes place in the vicinity of the saddle corresponding to all electrons on a ring in a plane perpendicular to the field axis, as in the cases for two and three electrons. This saddle possesses both the lowest energy and the smallest critical exponent and thus the most favorable dependence of the cross-section on energy.

The next two configurations are almost degenerate in energy and have similar critical exponents. They form a triangle with an additional electron placed in the center. The saddle ν = 2 possesses a C3v symmetry, but the state ν = 3 has a Cv symmetry only. The last ν = 4 configuration, with all electrons in a plane, has significantly higher energy and larger critical exponent compared to the previous states.

Five electrons

For five electrons we find 5 configurations shown in Fig. [\ref=all_five_fig], with properties given in table [\ref=all_five]. The five electron problem constitutes actually a marginal case where the configuration of all electrons on a ring starts loosing its dominance. The energy of this configuration is only slightly lower than the energy of the state ν = 2 with one electron in the center and the others on a ring. The state ν = 2 possesses, however, a smaller critical exponent than the ν = 1 configuration. Therefore, unless there is a wide disparity in prefactors in the cross section law or residual correlations in the compound state that prefer one state over the other, we expect that both will contribute significantly to the process of non-sequential five electron escape.

The configurations ν = 3 and ν = 4 have the Cv symmetry and reveal higher energy and larger critical exponents than the previous ones. The last ν = 5 configuration with all electrons on a line is the least significant because of its high energy and its high critical exponent.

Six electrons

For six electrons we find 11 saddles, with properties listed in table [\ref=all_six]. The first five configurations are shown in Fig. [\ref=six_select_fig]. The state with all particles on a ring is no longer dominant, it appears in the middle of table [\ref=all_six]. The saddle with an electron in the center and the others on a ring dominates the non-sequential ionization process. It has both the lowest energy and the smallest critical exponent. The states ν = 2 and ν = 3 look similar, but differ in their symmetries: state ν = 2 has a Cv symmetry, state ν = 3 has a C3v symmetry.

Seven electrons

For seven electrons we have 14 states, with the properties listed in table [\ref=all_seven]. In Fig. [\ref=seven_select_fig] the first five states are shown. The configuration with one electron in the center and the others on a ring dominates the simultaneous electron escape, just as for the six electron problem.

Eight electrons

For eight electrons we have 26 configurations, listed in table [\ref=all_eight]. The dominant configuration has two electrons in the center and the other six around it, see Fig. [\ref=eight_select_fig]. The ν = 2 saddle also has two electrons in the center, but different arrangements of the outer electrons.

The state with one electron in the center and the others on a symmetric ring is the fifth configuration, the one with all electrons on a ring the 17th configuration. The saddles ν = 3 and ν = 4 are similar to the ν = 5 one but they only have a Cv symmetry, not the C7v one as for state ν = 5. All of these configurations possess similar characteristics, see table [\ref=all_eight].

The state with all particles on a line has the highest energy and the largest critical exponent. This is the case not only for the eight electron problem but for all N values analyzed here.

Concluding remarks

The analysis presented here confirms a trend anticipated from our analysis of triple ionization: that with an increasing number of electrons more and more saddle configurations and thus channels for non-sequential multiple ionization have to be considered. But the analysis also shows that, except for the somewhat marginal case of fivefold ionization, there is a well separated lowest lying saddle that dominates non-sequential multiple ionization. Table [\ref=summary_tab] collects the symmetries and the threshold exponents of this lowest lying state.

A few experiments with multiple ionization of atoms have already been performed. However, momenta of the ionization products have been measured for double and triple ionizations only. Currently, measurements of momenta of more than two electrons are not available, not even of a single component, say the one along the field axis. But already the measurement of parallel momenta for just two electrons would suffice for a preliminary test of the ionization pathways considered here. In particular, the breaking of symmetry between the outgoing electrons should be accessible. As long as the electrons are interchangeable, the distribution of parallel electron momenta should be like that for double ionization, with a clear preference for similar momenta. For N = 5 and more escaping electrons additional structures in the momentum distribution should appear, since the lowest lying saddle has non-equivalent electrons, see Figs. [\ref=all_four_fig] to [\ref=eight_select_fig]. The momentum distributions for the two N = 3 saddles are discussed in [\cite=eckhardt01pra2], and similar modifications in shape can be expected for more electrons.

The analysis presented here assumes simultaneous escape of all electrons in a multiple ionization event. It is of course also possible that first one or a few electrons escape, then the next batch of electrons leaves and so on, before one arrives at the final multiply charge ion. Sequential ionization becomes significant when the field intensity is high enough to ionize electrons from a highly excited state of the ion left behind when the first electrons are gone. Nevertheless, close to the threshold for non-sequential multiple ionization the characteristics of the non-sequential process as described here should be identifiable.
