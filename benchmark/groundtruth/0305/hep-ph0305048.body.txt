STRONG ANOMALIES IN KAON DECAYS

Introduction

In addition to the well-known anomaly in the global U(1) axial symmetry, massless QCD also exhibits a breaking of the invariance under dilatations at the quantum level. This is known as the trace anomaly. While the axial anomaly is related to a pseudoscalar combination of two gluon fields, the trace anomaly is associated with a scalar combination of two such fields.

Their implications in the hadronic world are numerous. For example, in the quarkonium transitions Ψ'  →  J / Ψη and Ψ'  →  J / Ψππ, it has been shown [\cite=Voloshin80] that the gluon conversions into η and ππ are governed by the axial and trace anomalies respectively.

Similarly, the possibility of trace anomaly dominance has been investigated in weak K decays. [\cite=Gerard01] In this talk, we show how an enhancement of the isoscalar pion pair production due to trace anomaly effects may be induced by strong interaction corrections to the ΔS = 1 Fermi Hamiltonian.

A trace anomaly contribution to the ΔI = 1 / 2 rule in Kaon decays

The lowest order ΔS = 1 quark-gluon (qG) effective Hamiltonian that contains the trace anomaly (TA) operator reads:

[formula]

where Gaμν denotes the gluon field strenght tensor and the subscript L(R) refers to left(right)-handed spinors.

This 7-dimensional operator is generated by leading order short-distance (SD) QCD corrections to the ΔS = 1 Fermi Hamiltonian, at next-to-leading order in the momentum expansion. [\cite=Penin93] Yet the bulk of its contribution is expected to come from long-distance (LD) physics, as the anomaly is a non-perturbative phenomenon. Its effects on the ΔI = 1 / 2 amplitudes could thus be larger than first expected from power counting arguments.

The LD evolution is computed in a truncated non-linear sigma model approach. The initial operator ([\ref=eq:QGTA]) is bosonized into Uds at the confining scale. The unitary matrix U is related to the octet of light pseudoscalar fields πa through [formula] Fπ is the neutral pion decay constant and λa are the Gell-Mann matrices with normalization trλaλb = 2δab. Strong interaction corrections are modelled by the usual O(p2) non-linear Lagrangian [formula], where M is the real, diagonal, light quark mass matrix.

Using the background field method with a cut-off regularization, we obtain the following result at the one-loop level:

[formula]

with a  =   - 3Λ2  /  (4πFπ)2, b  =   ln (Λ2 / m2π)  /  32π2 and Λ is the ultra-violet cut-off.

We see that the lowest order non-linear realization of the TA operator, obtained by factorizing the quark from the gluon fields in ([\ref=eq:QGTA]), does indeed show up in the second line of Eq. ([\ref=eq:LDevol]).

Conclusion

We have indicated how a potentially important contribution of the QCD trace anomaly to the ΔI = 1 / 2 Kaon decay amplitudes can arise from strong interaction corrections to the ΔS = 1 Fermi Hamiltonian. A more quantitative analysis will require the investigation of the matching between the SD and LD evolutions. A previous study [\cite=Penin94] of K  →  ππ decay amplitudes with gluons in the intermediate state (but without any reference to the trace anomaly) predicts an enhancement of 14  ±  6% using QCD sum rules. The consistency between the two methods would be worth checking.
