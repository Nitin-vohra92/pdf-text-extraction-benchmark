On the questions P [formula] NP [formula] co-NP and NP [formula] co-NP for infinite time Turing machines

Introduction

The fundamental open problems in complexity theory for Turing machines running in finite time are whether P [formula] NP, whether P [formula] NP [formula] co-NP and whether NP [formula] co-NP.

After Hamkins and Lewis [\cite=HamLew] formalized the notion of a Turing machine running in transfinite ordinal time, the corresponding questions about infinite time Turing machines were posed. Schindler recently defined two versions of the classes P and NP in a Turing machine running in transfinite ordinal time. He labelled them P, NP and P+,NP+ and showed that P ≠   NP and P+  ≠  NP+. The proofs used a classical theorem from descriptive set theory stating that not all analytic sets are Borel. Analogies between the classes P and NP, and the classes of Borel and analytic sets respectively, had earlier been drawn by Sipser and others (cf. [\cite=Sip1] and the references therein).

We address the problems of whether P [formula] NP [formula] co-NP (resp. [formula] co-NP+) and whether NP [formula] co-NP (resp. [formula] co-NP+). We use a classical result by Suslin which characterizes analytic sets that are Borel as those whose complements are also analytic. Using Suslin's theorem, we prove that P =   NP [formula] co-NP. We then show that P+ is a strict subset of [formula] co-NP+ using properties of projections of hyperarithmetical sets.

We also observe that NP ≠   co-NP and NP+  ≠   co-NP+.

Preliminaries

This section will provide some notions from descriptive set theory needed in order to state our results. For details, the reader is referred to [\cite=Mos] [\cite=Kec].

We first fix our notation. The first infinite ordinal is denoted by ω, the first uncountable ordinal by ω1, the first non-recursive ordinal (i.e. the Church-Kleene ordinal) by ωCK1, and the ordinal of Gödel's constructible universe L by ωL1. A Polish space, i.e. a space that is separable and completely metrizable, is denoted by X. In this paper, we are particularly interested in Cantor space ω2 and Baire space ωω.

The class of Borel sets in X are denoted by [formula]. This class ramifies in an infinite Borel Hierarchy whose classes are denoted by Σ0ξ and Π0ξ. The projective sets obtained from Borel sets by the operations of projection and complementation ramify into a projective hierarchy of length ω whose classes are denoted by Σ1n and Π1n. The ambiguous classes are denoted by [formula]. Members of the class Σ11 are called analytic, members of Π11 are called co-analytic and members of Δ11 are called bi-analytic. The effective analogues of the Borel classes are denoted by lightface Σ0ξ and Π0ξ. Similarly the effective analogues of the projective classes are denoted by Σ1n, Π1n and Δ1n.

We need the following two central results in descriptive set theory.

If X is a standard Borel space, and A,B  ⊆  X are two disjoint analytic sets, then there is a Borel set C  ⊆  X such that A  ⊆  C and [formula].

For a Polish space X, B(X) = Δ11(X).

The Effros Borel space of the set of closed subsets of a Polish space is standard so the Lusin separation theorem can be applied. The proof of Suslin's theorem is immediate by letting B be the complement of A in the Lusin separation theorem.

Let α be a countable ordinal. We say that A  ⊂  ω2 is Δ11(α) in α if it is uniformly Δ11 in any real x coding a well-order of order type α.

Let A be Δ11(α) in a countable ordinal α as defined above. Let B be its projection. If B is a Borel set, then there exists a countable ordinal β such that B is Δ11(β).

Let WO be the set of codes of countable ordinals, and WO(α) be the set of codes of the ordinal α. Let Bc be the complement of B. Since B is Σ11 in α, it follows that there is a Π11 set D such that

[formula]

Let f be a recursive function such that

[formula]

Then Bc  ×  WO(α) is Borel and contained in D, therefore its image under f is analytic and contained in WO. By the Boundedness theorem, there is an ordinal δ, such that if |w| denotes the ordinal coded by w, we have

[formula]

for any code w of α and any code v of δ. It immediately follows that B is Δ11(β), for some β.

The countable ordinal β is possibly much larger than α. We have the following result from [\cite=KMS].

There exist Δ11 sets with projections that are Δ11(ωL1), but not Δ11(α) for any α  <  ωL1.

There exist hyperarithmetical sets whose projections are Borel but not hyperarithmetical.

Immediate from the Lemma [\ref=lemma:notless] by letting α be recursive and observing that ωL1  >  ωCK1.

Infinite time Turing machines

Infinite time Turing machines were introduced in [\cite=HamLew]. There has been growing research interest in these machines especially after Schindler [\cite=Sch] showed that P ≠   NP in this transfinite setting. We recall the following definitions from [\cite=Sch].

Let A  ⊂    ω2 and let α  ≤  ω1  +  1. Then A is in Pα if there exists a Turing machine T and some β  <  α such that (a) T decides A (b) T halts on all inputs after <  β many steps.

Let A  ⊂    ω2 and let α  ≤  ω1  +  1. Then A is in NPα if there exists a Turing machine T and some β  <  α such that (a) x∈A if and only if [formula] such that T accepts [formula] (b) T halts on all inputs after <  β many steps.

The classes P and NP in infinite time Turing machines

If we let all inputs x∈  ω2 as having the same length ω, then we have the following characterization of the classes P and NP.

P =  Pωω and NP =  NPωω.

The following description of the class P is given in [\cite=Sch].

Let A  ⊂    ω2. Then A∈PωCK1 if and only if A is a hyperarithmetic set. Furthermore, A∈Pω1 if and only if A is Δ11(α) in a countable ordinal α.

In particular, for a Borel set to be outside of Pω1, it must be Δ11 in a real x that does not code any countable well-order.

Now we state our main theorem.

P = NP [formula] co-NP.

Since P ⊂   NP and P =   co-P, it follows that P ⊂   co-NP and therefore P ⊆   NP [formula] co-NP. Let B  ⊂    ω2 satisfy B∈ NP [formula] co-NP. Since B∈ NP, it is the projection of a set in P. However, P ⊂  Δ11, which implies that B∈Σ11. Let Bc be the complement of B. Since B∈ co-NP, it follows that Bc∈NP. Thus Bc∈Σ11, which implies that B∈Π11. Therefore [formula]. From Suslin's theorem, it follows that B must be Borel.

We cannot immediately infer that B is in P because not all Borel sets are in P. Those in P are precisely those that are Δ11(α) in a countable ordinal α (note the use of lightface font as opposed to the boldface in the previous paragraph). We need to show that B is actually a Borel set in a countable ordinal. Now B is a projection of a set in P, which means it is the projection of a set that is Δ11(α) in a countable ordinal α. Further, we have shown that B is Borel. Thus B satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma [\ref=lemma:proj_is_countable]. It follows that B itself is Δ11(β) in a countable ordinal β. In other words, B is in P. Since this argument holds for any element of NP [formula] co-NP, this completes the proof.

NP ≠   co-NP.

This follows immediately from P ≠   NP and P = NP [formula] co-NP. An alternative proof is obtained by observing that in [\cite=Sch] and using the notation there, the lightface analytic set Δ which is the projection of a lightface Gδ set G is in NP but not in co-NP.

There is an interesting interplay between the answers to the questions P [formula] NP, P [formula] NP [formula] co-NP, and NP [formula] co-NP. Without the result P = NP [formula] co-NP, NP ≠   co-NP is a stronger statement than P ≠   NP because it implies P ≠   NP, however the converse is not true. On the other hand, if P = NP [formula] co-NP, then NP ≠   co-NP if and only if P ≠   NP.

The classes P+ and NP+ in infinite time Turing machines

If we regard an input x∈  ω2 as having length ωx1, which is the least x-admissible ordinal greater than ω, then the versions of the classes P and NP obtained are labelled P+ and NP+. We recall the following definitions from [\cite=Sch]

Let A  ⊂    ω2. We say that A is in P+ if there exists a Turing machine T such that (a) x∈A if and only if T accepts x (b) T halts on all inputs after <  ωx1 many steps.

Let A  ⊂    ω2. We say that A is in NP+ if there exists a Turing machine T such that (a) x∈A if and only if [formula] such that T accepts [formula] (b) T halts on all inputs [formula] after <  ωx1 many steps.

P+  =  PωCK1  =  Δ11

P+  ≠  NP+.

We now show that the class P+ is a strict subset of [formula].
