Holonomicity of relative characters and applications to multiplicity bounds for spherical pairs

Introduction

The relative character

In this paper, we prove that a relative character (a.k.a. spherical character) of a smooth admissible Fréchet   representation of moderate growth of a real reductive group is holonomic. The relative character is a basic notion of relative representation theory that generalizes the notion of a character of a representation. By a real reductive group we mean a connected algebraic reductive group defined over [formula]. Unless confusion is possible, we will not distinguish between such a group and the group of its real points. Let us now recall the notions of spherical pair, relative character and holonomic distribution. For the notion of smooth admissible Fréchet   representation of moderate growth we refer the reader to [\cite=CasGlob] or [\cite=Wal].

Let G be a real reductive group and let H  ⊂  G be its (algebraic) subgroup. Let P denote a minimal parabolic subgroup of G and B denote a Borel subgroup of the complexification [formula]. The subgroup H is called real spherical if it has finitely many orbits on G / P and spherical if its complexification has finitely many orbits on [formula].

It is known that a pair (G,H) is spherical if and only if [formula] has an open orbit on [formula] and real spherical if and only if H has an open orbit on G / P, see [\cite=KSGeo].

Let G be a real reductive group and let H1,H2  ⊂  G be its (algebraic) spherical subgroups and let [formula] be the Lie algebras of Hi. Let χi be characters of [formula]. Let π be a smooth admissible Fréchet   representation of moderate growth of G and π̂ be its smooth contragredient. Let [formula] and [formula] be equivariant functionals. Fix a Haar measure on G. It gives rise to an action of the space of Schwartz functions S(G) on π* and π̂*, and this action maps elements of π* and π̂* to elements of π̂ and   =  π respectively. For the definition of the space of Schwartz functions S(G) see, e.g., [\cite=CasGlob] [\cite=Wal] [\cite=AGSc].

The relative character ξφ1,φ2 of π, with respect to φ1 and φ2, is the tempered distribution on G (i.e. a continuous functional on S(G)) defined by 〈ξφ1,φ2,f〉  =  〈φ1,π(f)  ·  φ2〉.

The singular support [formula] of a distribution ξ on a real algebraic manifold X is the joint zero set in T*X of all the symbols of (algebraic) differential operators that annihilate ξ. The distribution ξ is called holonomic if [formula].

In this paper we prove the following theorem.

We prove using the following well-known statement.

Let [formula] be the Lie algebras of G and Hi, i = 1,2. Identify T*G with [formula] and let

[formula]

Then [formula].

Note that the Bernstein inequality states that the dimension of the singular support of any non-zero distribution is at least the dimension of the underlying manifold. Thus Theorem [\ref=thm:main] follows from the following more precise version, which is the core of this paper.

Let [formula] Note that U is Zariski open since S is conic and closed. It is easy to see that implies the following corollary. This corollary is useful in view of the next proposition, which follows from below.

The restriction ξφ1,φ2|U is an analytic function.

Bounds on the dimension of the space of solutions

Next we apply our results to representation theory. For this, we use the following theorem.

Let X be a real algebraic manifold. Let

[formula]

be a system of linear PDE on X with algebraic coefficients. Suppose that the joint zero set of the symbols of Di is dim X-dimensional. Then the space of solutions of this system in S*(X) is finite-dimensional.

It seems that this theorem is not found in the literature in this formulation, however it has two proofs, one due to Kashiwara (see [\cite=Kas] [\cite=KK] for similar statements) and another due to Bernstein (unpublished).

In order to make our applications in representation theory more precise, we need an effective version of this theorem. We prove such a version (see Theorem [\ref=thm:FinSol] below) following Bernstein's approach, as it is more appropriate for effective bounds. We use this effective version to derive a relative version. Namely, we show that if the system depends on a parameter in an algebraic way, then the dimension of the space of solutions is bounded (see § [\ref=subsec:DimSolRel] below).

This relative version allows us to deduce the following theorem.

Applications to representation theory

Using § [\ref=sec:DimSol], we give a short proof of some results from [\cite=KO] [\cite=KS]. Namely, we prove:

This corollary follows from Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult] since [formula] lies in the space of [formula]-invariant functionals on the completed tensor product [formula] (see [\cite=AMOT]). All symmetric pairs satisfying the conditions of the corollary were classified in [\cite=KM].

The inverse implications for Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult] and Corollary [\ref=cor:strong] are proven in [\cite=KO].

An advantage of Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult][\eqref=it:Fin] over [\cite=KO] [\cite=KS] is that Cn does not depend on τ. On the other hand, the results on multiplicities in [\cite=KO] [\cite=KS] are slightly stronger than Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult] since they allow H to be any closed Lie subgroup and consider maps from the Harish-Chandra space of π to τ. In addition, [\cite=KO] implies that if H  ⊂  G is an algebraic spherical subgroup there exists [formula] such that [formula] for every [formula] and every finite-dimensional continuous representation τ of H. It is easy to modify our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult][\eqref=it:Bound] to show the boundedness of multiplicities for any [formula] and any τ of a fixed dimension, but the proof that the bound depends linearly on this dimension would require more work.

Our methods are different from the methods of [\cite=KO], which in turn differ from the ones of [\cite=KS], and the bounds given in the three works are probably very different.

The non-Archimedean case

Theorem [\ref=thm:geo] and Corollary [\ref=cor:geo] hold over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero. They are useful also for p-adic local fields F, since the analogs of hold in this case, see [\cite=AGS]. Namely, we have the following theorem.

Let G be a reductive group defined over a non-Archimedean field F of characteristic 0 and let ξ be a relative character of a smooth admissible representation with respect to two spherical subgroups H1,H2  ⊂  G. Let S and U be the sets defined in . Then

The wave front set of ξ lies in S.

The restriction of ξ to U is given by a locally constant function.

Related results

In the group case, i.e. the case when G = H  ×  H and H1 = H2  =  ΔH  ⊂  H  ×  H, Theorem [\ref=thm:main] essentially becomes the well-known fact that characters of admissible representations are holonomic distributions.

As we mentioned above, Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult] was proven earlier in [\cite=KO] [\cite=KS] using different methods. An analog of Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult][\eqref=it:Fin] over non-Archimedean fields is proven in [\cite=Del] and [\cite=SV] for many spherical pairs, including arbitrary symmetric pairs.

The group case of , , and [\eqref=thm:AGS:U] is (the easy part of) the Harish-Chandra regularity theorem (see [\cite=HCBul] [\cite=HCReg]). Another known special case of these results is the regularity of Bessel functions, see [\cite=LM] [\cite=AGK] [\cite=AG].

Future applications

Our proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult][\eqref=it:Bound] does not use the Casselman embedding theorem (Theorem [\ref=thm:CasSubRep]). This gives us hope that it can be extended to the non-Archimedean case. The main difficulty is the fact that our proof heavily relies on the theory of modules over the ring of differential operators, which does not act on distributions in the non-Archimedean case. However, in view of we believe that this difficulty can be overcome. Namely, one can deduce an analog of Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult][\eqref=it:Bound] for many spherical pairs from the following conjecture .

Let G be a reductive group defined over a non-Archimedean field F of characteristic 0 and let H1,H2  ⊂  G be its (algebraic) spherical subgroups. Let χi be characters of Hi. Fix a character λ of the Bernstein center [formula].

Then the space of distributions which are:

left (H1,χ1)-equivariant,

right (H2,χ2)-equivariant,

[formula]-eigen,

is finite-dimensional. Moreover, this dimension is uniformly bounded when λ varies.

Note that and [\eqref=thm:AGS:S] imply that the dimension of (the Zariski closure of) the wave front set of a distribution that satisfies (1-3) does not exceed dim G. In many ways the wave front set replaces the singular support, in absence of the theory of differential operators (see, e.g., [\cite=Aiz] [\cite=AD] [\cite=AGS] [\cite=AGK]). Thus, in order to prove , it is left to prove analogs of for the integral system of equations (1-3).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:geo]

It is enough to prove the theorem for a reductive group G defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Since S includes the zero section of [formula], we have dim S  ≥   dim G. Thus, it is enough to prove that dim S  ≤   dim G. Let B denote the flag variety of G and [formula] denote the nilpotent cone. Since G is reductive, we can identify

[formula]

Recall the Springer resolution μ:T*B  →  N defined by μ(B,X) = X and consider the following diagram.

[formula]

Here, α is defined by [formula], and res is the restriction. Passing to the fiber of [formula], we obtain the following diagram.

[formula]

Here, [formula] and [formula].We need to estimate dim S. We do it using the following lemma.

Let φi:Xi  →  Y, i = 1,2, be morphisms of algebraic varieties. Suppose that φ2 is surjective. Then there exists y∈Y such that

[formula]

By this lemma, applied to φ1  =  α' and φ2  =  μ', it is enough to estimate the dimensions of Li and of the fibers of μ' and α'.

We have dim L1  =   dim L2  =   dim B.

Since Hi has finitely many orbits in B, it is enough to show that Li is the union of the conormal bundles to the orbits of Hi in B. Let B∈B, and [formula], and identify [formula]. Then [formula] and the conormal space at B to the Hi-orbit of B is identified with [formula].

Let [formula]. The fiber [formula] is isomorphic to the stabilizer Gη, and the dimension of the fiber [formula] is twice the dimension of the Springer fiber μ- 1(η). Recall the following theorem of Steinberg (conjectured by Grothendieck):

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:tech], we obtain for some (η,ad*(g)η):

[formula]

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:tech]

Recall that, for a dominant morphism φ:X  →  Y of irreducible varieties, there exists an open dense U  ⊂  Y such that dim X =  dim Y +  dim φ- 1(y) for all y∈U (see, e. g., [\cite=RedBook]). Let Z be an irreducible component of X1 of maximal dimension and W  ⊂  Y be the Zariski closure of φ1(Z). Since W is irreducuble, there exists an open dense U  ⊂  W such that

[formula]

for all y∈U. Let V  ⊂  U be an open dense subset such that φ- 12(V) intersects those and only those irreducible components [formula] of φ- 12(W) that map dominantly to W. Note that j > 0 since φ2 is surjective. Moreover, without loss of generality, we may assume that, for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  j, all fibers over V of the restriction of φ2 to Ci are of the same dimension. Since one of these dimensions has to be equal to dim φ- 12(V) -  dim V, we have, that there is an 1  ≤  i  ≤  j such that, for all y∈V,

[formula]

Thanks to dim V =  dim W, taking any y∈V, formulas [\eqref=eq:dim1] and [\eqref=eq:dim2] imply the statement.

Dimension of the space of solutions of a holonomic system

In this section, we prove an effective version of Theorem [\ref=thm:DimSol], and then adapt it to algebraic families. We also derive Theorem [\ref=thm:FinOrb].

Preliminaries

D-modules

In this section, we will use the theory of D-modules on algebraic varieties over an arbitrary field k of characteristic zero. We will now recall some facts and notions that we will use. For a good introduction to the algebraic theory of D-modules, we refer the reader to [\cite=Ber] and [\cite=Bor]. For a short overview, see [\cite=AMOT].

By a D-module on a smooth algebraic variety X we mean a coherent sheaf of right modules over the sheaf DX of algebras of algebraic differential operators. Denote the category of DX-modules by M(DX).

For a smooth affine variety V, we denote D(V): = DV(V). Note that the category M(DV) of D-modules V is equivalent to the category of D(V)-modules. We will thus identify these categories.

The algebra D(V) is equipped with a filtration which is called the geometric filtration and defined by the degree of differential operators. The associated graded algebra with respect to this fitration is the algebra O(T*V) of regular functions on the total space of the cotangent bundle of V. This allows us to define the singular support of a D-module M on V in the following way. Choose a good filtration on M, i.e. a filtration such that the associated graded module is a finitely-generated module over O(T*V), and define the singular support SS(M) to be the support of this module. One can show that the singular support does not depend on the choice of a good filtration on M.

This definition easily extends to the non-affine case. A D-module M on X is called smooth if SS(M) is the zero section of T*X. This is equivalent to being coherent over OX and to be coherent and locally free over OX. The Bernstein inequality states that, for any non-zero M, we have dim SS(M)  ≥   dim X. If the equality holds then M is called holonomic.

For a closed embedding i:X  →  Y of smooth affine algebraic varieties, define the functor i!:M(DY)  →  M(DX) by i!(M): = {m∈M  |  IXm = 0}, where IX  ⊂  O(Y) is the ideal of all functions that vanish on X. It has a left adjoint functor i*:M(DX)  →  M(DY), given by tensor product with i!(DY). The functor i* is an equivalence of categories between M(DX) and the category of DY-modules supported in X. Both i* and i! map holonomic modules to holonomic ones.

If V is an affine space then the algebra D(V) has an additional filtration, called the Bernstein filtration. It is defined by deg (∂  /  ∂xi) =  deg (xi) = 1, where xi are the coordinates in V. This gives rise to the notion of Bernstein's singular support, that we will denote [formula]. It is known that dim SS(M) =  dim SSb(M).

We will also use the theory of analytic D-modules. By an analytic D-module on a smooth complex analytic manifold X we mean a coherent sheaf of right modules over the sheaf DAnX of algebras of differential operators with analytic coefficients. All of the above notions and statements, except those concerning the Bernstein filtration, have analytic counterparts. In addition, all smooth analytic D-modules of the same rank are isomorphic.

Distributions

We will use the theory of distributions on differentiable manifolds and the theory of tempered distributions on real algebraic manifolds, see e.g. [\cite=Hor] [\cite=AGSc]. For a real algebraic manifold X, we denote the space of distributions on X by D'(X): = (C∞c(X))* and the space of tempered distributions (a.k.a. Schwartz distributions) by S*(X): = (S(X))*. Similarly, for an algebraic bundle E over X we denote D'(X,E): = (C∞c(X,E))* and S*(X,E): = (S(X,E))*. The spaces D'(X) and S*(X) form (right) D-modules over X. The space D'(X) is also an analytic D-module. We define the singular support of a distribution to be the singular support of the D-module it generates. It is well-known that this definition is equivalent to Definition [\ref=def:SISDist]. We say that a distribution is holonomic if it generates a holonomic D-module.

Let i:X  →  Y be a closed embedding of smooth affine real algebraic varieties. Then

[formula]

Let M be a smooth [formula]-module of rank r. Embed the space [formula] of analytic functions on [formula] into [formula] using the Lebesgue measure. Then [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula] be the analytizations of M and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Since MAn is also smooth, [formula]. Thus it is left to prove that

[formula]

and the latter space is one-dimensional. This follows from the fact that a distribution with vanishing partial derivatives is a multiple of the Lebesgue measure.

If a distribution generates a smooth D-module, then it is analytic.

Lie algebra actions

Let X be an algebraic manifold over a field k and [formula] be a Lie algebra over k.

An action of [formula] on X is a Lie algebra map from [formula] to the algebra of algebraic vector fields on X.

Assume that X is affine, fix an action of [formula] on X and let E be an algebraic vector bundle on X. Let M be the space of global regular (algebraic) sections of E. An action of [formula] on E is a linear map [formula] such that, for any [formula], we have

[formula]

The definition above extends to non-affine X in a straightforward way.

Weil representation

Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space. Let ω be the standard symplectic form on [formula]. Denote by [formula] and [formula] the natural projections. Define an action of the symplectic group [formula] on the algebra D(V) by

[formula]

where v∈V,  w∈V*,  ∂v denotes the derivative in the direction of v, and elements of V* are viewed as linear polynomials and thus differential operators of order zero. For a D(V)-module M and an element [formula], we will denote by Mg the D(V)-module obtained by twisting the action of D(V) by π(g).

Since the above action of [formula] preserves the Bernstein filtration on D(V), the following lemma holds.

For a D(V)-module M and [formula] we have SSb(Mg) = gSSb(M).

There exists a two-folded cover [formula] and a representation Π of [formula] on the space S*(V) of tempered distributions on V such that, for any α∈D(V), [formula], ξ∈S*(V), we have

[formula]

We have an isomorphism of D(V)-modules [formula] for any [formula].

In fact, this corollary can be derived directly from the Stone-von-Neumann theorem.

Flat morphisms

Let φ:X  →  Y be a proper morphism of algebraic varieties over a field k and M be a coherent sheaf on X. Then there exists an open dense U  ⊂  Y such that M|φ- 1(U) is flat over U.

By [\cite=EGA4.3], the set V of scheme-theoretic points x∈X for which M is φ-flat at x is open in X. Since φ is proper, the set [formula] is closed in Y. Note that M is flat over [formula], since φ- 1(U)  ⊂  V. Moreover, U contains the generic points of the irreducible components of Y. Hence, U  ⊂  Y is dense.

Let φ:X  →  Y be a proper morphism of algebraic varieties and M be a coherent sheaf on X that is flat over Y. For a point y∈Y, let My denote the pullback of M to φ- 1(y). Then the function

[formula]

is locally constant.

Let Y be an algebraic variety and M be a coherent sheaf on [formula]. Then there exists an open dense U  ⊂  Y such that the Hilbert polynomial of My does not depend on y as long as y∈U.

Dimension of the space of solutions of a holonomic system

Let M be a D-module over an affine space [formula]. Let Fi be a good filtration on M with respect to the Bernstein filtration on the ring [formula]. Let p be the corresponding Hilbert polynomial of M, i.e. p(i) =  dim Fi for large enough i. Let k be the degree of p and ak be the leading coefficient of p. Define the Bernstein degree of M to be deg b(M): = k!ak. It is well-known that k and ak do not depend on the choice of good filtration Fi.

Let M be a D-module over a smooth algebraic variety X. Let [formula] be an open affine cover of X and let [formula] be closed embeddings. Denote

[formula]

Define the global degree of M by deg (M): =  min  deg {(Ui,φi)}(M), where the minimum is taken over the set of all possible affine covers and embeddings.

In this subsection, we prove

Let X be a real algebraic manifold. Let M be a holonomic right D-module. Then [formula].

We will need the following geometric lemmas

Let V be a vector space, L  ⊂  V be a subspace and C  ⊂  V be a closed conic algebraic subvariety such that [formula]. Then the projection p:C  →  V / L is a finite map.

By induction, it is enough to prove the case dim L = 1. Choose coordinates [formula] on V such that the coordinates [formula] vanish on L. Let p be a homogeneous polynomial that vanishes on C but not on L. Write [formula], where each gi is a homogeneous polynomial of degree k - i in [formula]. Then xn|C satisfies a monic polynomial equation with coefficients in O(V / L).

Let W be a 2n-dimensional symplectic vector space, and C  ⊂  W be a closed conic subvariety of dimension n. Then there exists a Lagrangian subspace L  ⊂  W such that [formula].

Let L denote the variety of all Lagrangian subspaces of W. Note that dim L  =  n(n + 1) / 2. Let [formula] be the projectivizations of C and W. Consider the configuration space

[formula]

We have to show that p(X)  ≠  L where p:X  →  L is the projection. Let q:X  →  P(C) be the other projection. Note that dim q- 1(x) = n(n - 1) / 2 for any x∈P(C). Thus

[formula]

and thus p:X  →  L cannot be onto.

Let V be a vector space of dimension n. Consider the standard symplectic form on [formula]. Let [formula] be a closed conic subvariety of dimension n. Let [formula] denote the projection. Then there exists a linear symplectic automorphism [formula] such that p|gC is a finite map.

By there exists a Lagrangian subspace [formula] such that [formula]. Since the action of [formula] on Lagrangian subspaces is transitive, there exists [formula] such that V* = gL and thus [formula]. From we get that p|gC is a finite map.

Let [formula] be an open affine cover of X and let [formula] be closed embeddings. Clearly

[formula]

By

[formula]

Thus it is enough to show that for any holonomic D-module N on an affine space [formula] we have [formula].

Let [formula] be the singular support of N with respect to the Bernstein filtration. By , there exists [formula] such that p|gC is a finite map, where [formula] is the projection on the first n coordinates. By Corollary [\ref=cor:Weil] we have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:SympSupp] we have SSb(Ng) = gC. Let F be a good filtration on Ng (with respect to the Bernstein filtration on [formula]). We see that [formula] is finitely generated over [formula], and thus so is Ng. Thus Ng is a smooth D-module. Note that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:Free] [formula].

Families of D-modules

In this section we discuss families of D-modules on algebraic varieties over an arbitrary field k of zero characteristic.

Let X,Y be smooth algebraic varieties.

If X and Y are affine we define the algebra D(X,Y) to be [formula].

Extending this definition we obtain a sheaf of algebras DX,Y on X  ×  Y.

By a family of DX-modules parameterized by Y, we mean a sheaf of rightmodules over the sheaf of algebras DX,Y on X  ×  Y which is quasicoherent as a sheaf of OX  ×  Y-modules.

We call a family of DX-modules parameterized by Y coherent if it is locally finitely generated as a DX,Y-module.

For a family M of DX-modules parameterized by Y and a point y∈Y, we call My the specialization of M at y and consider it with the natural structure of a DX-module.

We say that a coherent family M is holonomic if every specialization is holonomic.

Let X,Y be smooth algebraic varieties and M be a family of DX-modules parametrized by Y. Then deg My is bounded when y ranges over the k-points of Y.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that [formula] and Y is an affine variety, and prove that deg b(My) is bounded. We will prove this by induction on dim Y.

The Bernstein filtration on [formula] gives rise to a filtration on [formula]. Choose a filtration F on M which is good with respect to this filtration and let [formula], considered as a graded [formula]-module. Associate to N a coherent sheaf N on [formula]. Let Ny be the pullback of N under the embedding of [formula] into [formula] given by x  ↦  (x,y). By definition, the Hilbert polynomial of My with respect to the filtration induced by F is the Hilbert polynomial of Ny. By Corollary [\ref=cor:loc_const], there exists an open dense subset U  ⊂  Y such that the Hilbert polynomial of Ny does not depend on y as long as y∈U. By the induction hypothesis, deg b(My) is bounded on [formula], and thus bounded on Y.

For an application of this theorem we will need the following lemma.

Let a real Lie algebra [formula] act on a real algebraic manifold X and on an algebraic vector bundle E on X. Fix a natural number n and let Y be the variety of all representations of [formula] on [formula]. Then there exists a coherent family M of DX-modules parameterized by Y such that, for any τ∈Y, we have

[formula]

The singular support of Mτ (with respect to the geometric filtration) is included in

[formula]

It is enough to prove the lemma for affine X. Let N be the coherent sheaf of the regular (algebraic) sections of E (considered as a sheaf of OX-modules). Let N be the pullback of N to X  ×  Y. Let [formula], and N''  ⊂  N' be the DX,Y-submodule generated by elements of the form

[formula]

where [formula], ξα is the vector field on X corresponding to α, and [formula] is the [formula]-valued regular function on X  ×  Y given by fα(v)(x,τ) = τ(α)v. Then M: = N' / N'' satisfies the requirements.

Proof of

In this section, we derive from Theorem [\ref=thm:geo] and § [\ref=sec:DimSol]. We do that by embedding the multiplicity space into a certain space of relative characters.

Preliminaries

For a real reductive group G, we denote by Irr(G) the collection of irreducible admissible smooth Fréchet   representation of G of moderate growth. We refer to [\cite=CasGlob] [\cite=Wal] for the background on these representations.

The center [formula] of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of G acts finitely on every admissible smooth Fréchet   representation π of G of moderate growth. This means that there exists an ideal in [formula] of finite codimension that annihilates π.

For any real reductive group G, there exists an involution θ of G such that, for any [formula], we have [formula].

Let G be a real reductive group and P be a minimal parabolic subgroup of G. Let π∈Irr(G). Then there exists a finite-dimensional representation σ of P and an epimorphism [formula].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main] and Proposition [\ref=prop:S]

Theorem [\ref=thm:main] follows from and Proposition [\ref=prop:S].

Let ξ be a relative character of a smooth admissible Fréchet   representation π of G of moderate growth with respect to a pair of subgroups (H1,H2) and their characters χ1,χ2. By , there exists an ideal [formula] of finite codimension that annihilates π and thus annihilates ξ. For any element [formula], there exists a polynomial p such that p(z)∈I and thus p(z)ξ = 0. This implies that the symbol of any [formula] of positive degree vanishes on the singular support of ξ. It is well-known that the joint zero-set of these symbols over each point g∈G is the nilpotent cone [formula]. Since ξ is [formula]-equivariant, this implies that the singular support of ξ lies in S.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:IntroMult]

Part [\eqref=it:Fin] follows immediately from and the Casselman embedding theorem. If G is quasi-split then so does part [\eqref=it:Bound]. For the proof of part [\eqref=it:Bound] in the general case, we will need the following lemma.

Let G be a real reductive group and H1,H2 be spherical subgroups. Let [formula], where Yi is the variety of characters of [formula]. For any [formula], define [formula] to be the space of tempered distributions on G that are left χ1-equivariant with respect to [formula], right χ2-equivariant with respect to [formula] and are eigendistributions with respect to the action of [formula] with eigencharacter λ. Then dim Uλ,χ1,χ2 is bounded over [formula].

Let us construct a family of D(G)-modules M parameterized by Y. For any [formula], let rα and lα be the corresponding right and left invariant vector fields on G considered as elements in D(G,Y). For any [formula], [formula], let fβ,giαi be the functions on Y that send (μ,γ1,γ2)∈Y to μ(β),γi(αi) respectively. Let also dβ be the differential operator on G corresponding to β, such that dβξ  =  βξ for any distribution ξ on G. We consider dβ,rα1,lα2,fβ,giαi as elements of D(G,Y). Let I  ⊂  D(G,Y) be the ideal generated by rα1 -   g1α1, lα2 -   g2α2 and fβ  -dβ where [formula] and [formula]. Define M: = D(G,Y) / I.

It is easy to see that [formula]. As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop:S], the singular support of M(λ,χ1,χ2) lies in S, for any λ,χ1,χ2. By Theorem [\ref=thm:geo], M(λ,χ1,χ2) is holonomic and, therefore, M is holonomic. By Theorem [\ref=thm:FinSol], we have dim Uλ,χ1,χ2  ≤   deg M(λ,χ1,χ2). By , deg M(λ,χ1,χ2) are bounded.

We choose an involution θ as in , let H1: = H,  H2: = θ(H), and define the spaces Uλ as in .

Now let [formula] and let χ be a character of [formula] such that [formula]. Let λ stand for the infinitesimal character of π. By , [formula]. Fix a non-zero [formula]. Then φ defines an embedding [formula] by ψ  ↦  ξψ,φ, where ξψ,φ is the relative character, which is defined by ξψ,φ(f): = 〈ψ,π(f)φ〉. Thus, [formula], which is bounded by .

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:PullDist]

For the proof, we will need the following standard lemmas. Let M be a smooth manifold and N  ⊂  M be a closed smooth submanifold.

Denote [formula]. Let J  ⊂  IN be an ideal in [formula] such that

For any x∈N, the space {dxf  |  f∈J} is the conormal space to N in M at the point x.

For any [formula], there exists f∈J such that f(x)  ≠  0.

Then J = IN.

Using partition of unity, it is enough to show that, for any f∈IN and x∈M, there exists f'∈J such that f coincides with f' in a neighborhood of x. For x∉N this is obvious, so we assume that x∈N. We prove the statement by induction on the codimension d of N in M. The base case d = 1 follows, using the implicit function theorem, from the case [formula], which is obvious.

For the induction step, take an element g∈J such that dxg  ≠  0. Let

[formula]

By the implicit function theorem, [formula] is a closed submanifold of U. Choose [formula] such that ρ = 1 in a neighborhood of x and [formula]. Let [formula]. Let

[formula]

By the induction hypothesis, ∈. Thus, there exists f''∈J such that f - f'' vanishes in a neighborhood of x in Z. Now, the case d = 1 implies that there exists [formula] such that f - f'' coincides with αg in a neighborhood of x.

The restriction [formula] is an open map.

Let K  ⊂  M be a compact subset. It is easy to see that there exists a compact K'  ⊃  K such that the restriction map [formula] is onto, using the partition of unity. By the Banach open map theorem this map is open. Thus, the restriction [formula] is an open map.

Let Y be a real algebraic manifold and X be a closed algebraic submanifold. Let i:X  →  Y denote the embedding.

Let ξ be a distribution on X such that i*ξ is a tempered distribution. Then ξ is a tempered distribution.

The map i* is dual to the pullback map C∞c(Y)  →  C∞c(X). This can be extended to a continuous map i*:S(Y)  →  S(X) which is onto by [\cite=AGSc]. The Banach open map theorem implies that i* is an open map. It is easy to see that [formula] vanishes on Ker(i*), and thus it gives rise to a continuous map [formula], which extends ξ.

Let ξ be a distribution on Y such that pξ = 0 for any polynomial p on Y that vanishes on X. Then ξ is a pushforward of a distribution on X.

Let J(X) be the ideal of all polynomials on Y that vanish on X. Let [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:id] we have J = IX. Thus, ξ vanishes on IX and thus, by Lemma [\ref=lem:OpenMap], ξ is a pushforward of a distribution on X.

Lemma [\ref=lem:PullDist] follows from and the definition of i! for closed embedding of smooth affine varieties.
