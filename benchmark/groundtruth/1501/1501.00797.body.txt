Transmission eigenvalues for strictly concave domains

Abstract. We show that for strictly concave domains there are no interior transmission eigenvalues in a region of the form [formula], Cε > 0, for every 0 < ε  ≪  1. As a consequence, we obtain Weyl asymptotics for the number of the transmission eigenvalues with an almost optimal remainder term.

Introduction and statement of results

Let [formula], d  ≥  2, be a bounded, connected domain with a C∞ smooth boundary Γ  =  ∂Ω. A complex number [formula], λ  ≠  0, will be said to be a transmission eigenvalue if the following problem has a non-trivial solution:

[formula]

where ν denotes the exterior Euclidean unit normal to Γ, [formula], j = 1,2 are strictly positive real-valued functions. Let [formula] be such that f < 0 in Ω, f > 0 in [formula], df  ≠  0 on Γ. Given an Hamiltonian g∈C∞(T*Ω) of the form

[formula]

the boundary Γ will be said to be g -  strictly concave (viewed from the interior) iff for any (x,ξ) satisfying

[formula]

we have

[formula]

where {  ·  ,  ·  } denotes the Poisson brackets. Set [formula]. Our main result is the following

Let Γ be gj  -   strictly concave, j = 1,2, and assume either the condition

[formula]

or the condition

[formula]

Then, for every 0 < ε  ≪  1 there exists a constant Cε > 0 such that there are no transmission eigenvalues in the region

[formula]

Remark 1. It has been proved in [\cite=kn:V] that, under the conditions (1.2) and (1.3), for arbitrary domains there are no transmission eigenvalues in

[formula]

for every 0 < ε  ≪  1.

Remark 2. The assumption that Γ is strictly concave does not improve the eigenvalue-free regions in Re  λ < 0. Note that it is proved in [\cite=kn:V] that for arbitrary domains there are no transmission eigenvalues in Re  λ  ≤   - C for some constant C > 0 under the assumption (1.2), and in

[formula]

for any N > 1 under the assumption (1.3).

Remark 3. When the function in the left-hand side of (1.3) is strictly positive, large eigenvalue-free regions have been proved in [\cite=kn:V] for arbitrary domains, which however are worse than the eigenvalue-free regions in the cases considered in the present paper. It seems that in this case no improvement is possible even if the domain is supposed strictly concave.

Remark 4. It has been proved recently in [\cite=kn:PV] that the total counting function N(r) =   #  {λ  -  trans.  eig.:  |λ|  ≤  r2}, r > 1, satisfies the asymptotics

[formula]

where 0 < κ  ≤  1 is such that there are no transmission eigenvalues in the region

[formula]

and

[formula]

ωd being the volume of the unit ball in [formula].

Theorem 1.1 and Remark 4 imply the following

Under the conditions of Theorem 1.1, the counting function of the transmission eigenvalues satisfies the asymptotics

[formula]

To prove Theorem 1.1 we follow the same strategy as in [\cite=kn:V]. We first reduce our problem to a semi-classical one by putting h = (Re  λ)- 1 / 2, z = h2λ = 1 + ih2Im  λ. Thus we have to show that the operator T(h,z) = c1N1(h,z) - c2N2(h,z) is invertible for |Im  z|  ≥  h1 - ε, 0 < h  ≪  1, [formula] (see Theorem 7.1), where Nj is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map associated to the operator [formula] (see Section 2 for the precise definition and the main properties). It is shown in [\cite=kn:V] that the operator T(h,z) is invertible in the region |Im  z|  ≥  h1 / 2 - ε for an arbitrary domain Ω. In the present paper we show that this region can be extended to |Im  z|  ≥  h1 - ε if Γ is strictly concave with respect to both g1 and g2. To do so, we have to study more carefully the DN map Nj near the glancing manifold Σj  =  {(x,ξ)∈T*Γ:r0(x,ξ) = mj(x)}, where mj denotes the restriction on Γ of the function nj / cj, while r0 > 0 is the principal symbol of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Γ with Riemannian metric induced by the Euclidean metric in [formula]. We show that Nj(h,z) = O(hε / 4):L2(Γ)  →  L2(Γ) in an O(hε) neighbourhood of Σj as long as h1 - ε  ≤  |Im  z|  ≤  hε (see Theorem 2.2). With this property in hands, the invertibility of T near Σj is almost immediate since the conditions (1.2) and (1.3) guarantee that N3 - j is elliptic on Σj, j = 1,2. The invertibility of T outside an O(hε) neighbourhood of [formula] for |Im  z|  ≥  h1 - ε is much easier and can be done in precisely the same way as in [\cite=kn:V] for an arbitrary domain. Indeed, the conditions (1.2) and (1.3) imply that in this region T(h,z) is an elliptic h - ΨDO, and hence easy to invert.

Thus the main (and the most difficult) point in our proof is the estimate (2.7) of Theorem 2.2 concerning the behavior of the DN map near the glancing manifold. Therefore the present paper is almost entirely devoted to the proof of Theorem 2.2. To do so, we make use of the global symplectic normal form proved in [\cite=kn:PoV] in order to transform our boundary-value problem in an O(hε) neighbourhood of the glancing manifold to a much simpler one in which we have complete separation of the normal and tangential variables (see the model equation in Section 5). The advantage is that we can build a relatively simple parametrix in terms of the Airy function and its derivatives (see Section 5). Note that our parametrix is much simpler than the parametrix of Melrose-Taylor [\cite=kn:MT] and therefore easier to work with. In particular, it is easier to control it as |Im  z|  →  0. Using the properties of the Airy function (see Section 3) we show in Section 5 that our parametrix is valid in an O(h1 + ε / |Im  z|) neighbourhood of the glancing manifold as long as h1 - 2ε  ≤  |Im  z|  ≤  hε. To cover the entire O(hε) neighbourhood of the glancing manifold we have to build another parametrix in Section 6 following the parametrix construction in [\cite=kn:V] and showing that it can be improved in the case of our model equation. When |Im  z|  ~  h2 / 3 a different parametrix, without using the Airy function, is constructed by Sjöstrand (see Section 11 of [\cite=kn:Sj]). In this case, it provides another proof of the estimate (2.7). Note finally that in Section 3 we prove some properties of the Airy function which play a crucial role in the parametrix construction in Section 5. They are more or less well-known and most of them can be found in [\cite=kn:O] and in the appendix of [\cite=kn:MT].

The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map

Let (X,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension n =  dim  X  ≥  2 with a non-empty smooth boundary ∂X. Then [formula] is a Riemannian manifold without boundary of dimension n - 1, where [formula] is the Riemannian metric on ∂X induced by the metric g. Denote by ΔX and Δ∂X the (negative) Laplace-Beltrami operators on (X,g) and [formula], respectively. The boundary ∂X is said to be strictly concave if the second fundamental form of ∂X is strictly positive. In the case when [formula] this definition coincides with that one given in the previous section. Given a function f∈H1(∂X), let u solve the equation

[formula]

where 0 < h  ≪  1 is a semi-classical parameter and [formula], 0 < |μ|  ≤  1. Then the semi-classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map

[formula]

is defined by

[formula]

where Dν =  - ih∂ν, ν being the unit normal to ∂X. It is well-known that for arbitrary manifolds one has the bound

[formula]

with a constant C > 0 independent of h and μ, where H1h(∂X) denotes the Sobolev space H1(∂X) equipped with the semi-classical norm [formula]. It has been proved recently that better bounds are possible if μ is not too close to zero. Indeed, it follows from Theorem 3.2 of [\cite=kn:V], still for arbitrary manifolds, that for every ε > 0 there is a constant 0 < h0(ε)  ≪  1 such that for all 0 < h  ≤  h0, [formula] we have the bound

[formula]

with a constant C > 0 independent of h, μ and ε. Note that (2.3) does not follow from (2.2). In [\cite=kn:V] semi-classical parametrices of the operator N(h,μ) are constructed in the hyperbolic zone H  =  {(x',ξ')∈T*∂X:r0(x',ξ') < 1}, in the glancing zone G  =  {(x',ξ')∈T*∂X:r0(x',ξ') = 1} and in the elliptic zone E  =  {(x',ξ')∈T*∂X:r0(x',ξ') > 1}. Hereafter, r0(x',ξ') denotes the principal symbol of the operator -  Δ∂X written in the coordinates (x',ξ'). To be more precise, introduce the set Skδ, [formula], [formula], of all functions a∈C∞(T*∂X) satisfying

[formula]

for all multi-indices α,β with constants Cα,β > 0 independent of h. We will denote by OPSkδ the set of the h-pseudo-differential operators (h-ΨDOs) with symbols in Skδ defined as follows

[formula]

Let χ-,χ0,χ+∈C∞(T*∂X) be independent of h and such that [formula], supp  χ-  ⊂  H, supp  χ+  ⊂  E, χ0 is supported in a small h-independent neighbourhood of G, χ0 = 1 in a smaller h-independent neighbourhood of G. Set [formula] with Im  ρ > 0. It was shown in [\cite=kn:V] that, mod O(h∞), the operator N(h,μ)Oph(χ-) belongs to OPS00 for |μ|  ≥  h1 - ε, 0 < ε  ≪  1, with a principal symbol ρχ-, the operator N(h,μ)Oph(χ0) belongs to OPS01 / 2 - ε for |μ|  ≥  h1 / 2 - ε with a principal symbol ρχ0, and N(h,μ)Oph(χ+) belongs to OPS10 with a principal symbol ρχ+. Summing up, we conclude that, mod O(h∞), the operator N(h,μ) belongs to OPS11 / 2 - ε for |μ|  ≥  h1 / 2 - ε with a principal symbol ρ. Therefore, in this case the bound (2.3) is a consequence of well-known properties of the h-ΨDOs. In fact, a more detailed anaysis of the operator N(h,μ) can be carried out allowing the functions χ+, χ- and χ0 to depend on h. More generally, it follows from the analysis in [\cite=kn:V] that given any function χ∈C∞0(T*∂X), for arbitrary ∂X, one can construct a parametrix for the operator N(h,μ)Oph(χ) as long as

[formula]

It is easy to see that given a parameter 0 < δ  ≪  1, there are functions χ-δ,χ0δ,χ+δ∈S0δ such that [formula], supp  χ-δ  ⊂  {r0 - 1  ≤   - hδ}, supp  χ+δ  ⊂  {r0 - 1  ≥  hδ}, supp  χ0δ  ⊂  {|r0 - 1|  ≤  2hδ}, χ0δ = 1 on {|r0 - 1|  ≤  hδ}. As in [\cite=kn:V] one can prove the following

For every 0 < ε  ≪  1 there is h0(ε) > 0 such that for 0 < h  ≤  h0, h1 - ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, we have the bound

[formula]

For |μ|  ≤  hε we also have the bound

[formula]

For h1 / 2 - ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, we have the bound

[formula]

When ∂X is strictly concave, Sjöstrand showed (see Section 11 of [\cite=kn:Sj]) that (2.3) still holds for C1h2 / 3  ≤  |μ|  ≤  C2h2 / 3, C2 > C1 > 0 being arbitrary, independent of h and μ. We will show in the present paper that for strictly concave ∂X the bound (2.3) holds true for h1 - ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, [formula]. To this end, we need to improve only the bound (2.6). We have the following

If ∂X is strictly concave, for every 0 < ε  ≪  1 there is h0(ε) > 0 such that for 0 < h  ≤  h0, h1 - ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, we have the bound

[formula]

Proof. We will make use of the symplectic normal form obtained in [\cite=kn:PoV] to reduce our problem to a simpler one for which it is easier to construct a parametrix. This model problem will be studied in the next sections. Let y = (y1,y')∈Xδ: = ( - δ,δ)  ×  ∂X, 0 < δ  ≪  1, be the normal geodesic coordinates with respect to the Riemannian metric g. Here we identify the points in (0,δ)  ×  ∂X with {x∈X:dist(x,∂X) < δ}. Then in these coordinates we can write

[formula]

where Dy1 =  - ih∂y1, Dy' =  - ih∂y', [formula]. Moreover q0(y',η'): = q(0,y',η') is the principal symbol of -  Δ∂X written in the coordinates (y',η'), while

[formula]

is the second fundamental form of ∂X supposed to be strictly positive (which is nothing else but the definition of g -  strictly concavity). Then the principal symbol p of the operator P(h,μ) =  - h2ΔX - 1 - iμ can be written in the coordinates (y,η)∈T*Xδ as follows

[formula]

Denote by R the set of all functions a∈C∞(T*Xδ) satisfying (with all derivatives)

[formula]

in a neighbourhood of K  =  {x1  =  ξ1 = 1 - q0 = 0}. We will also denote by OPR the h - ΨDOs on Xδ with symbols of the form [formula], where aj∈R do not depend on h. Let [formula], φ(σ) = 1 for |σ|  ≤  1 / 2, φ(σ) = 0 for |σ|  ≥  1. Given any 0 < ε  ≪  1, denote by Aε the h - ΨDO on Xδ with symbol φ(x1 / hε)φ((1 - q0) / hε). Clearly, if R∈OPR, we have

[formula]

It is shown in [\cite=kn:PoV] (see Theorem 3.1) that there exists an exact symplectic map χ:T*Xδ  →  T*Xδ such that χ(x,ξ) = (y(x,ξ),η(x,ξ)) satisfies

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

in a neighbourhood of K, where

[formula]

Thus, if U  ⊂  T*Xδ is a small neighbourhood of K, then χ sends U into itself. Using h -  Fourier integral operators on Xδ (h -  FIOs) associated to the canonical relation

[formula]

one can transform the operator P into a simpler one, P'0, which can be written in the coordinates (x,ξ) as follows

[formula]

where [formula], j = 1,2, with

[formula]

[formula]

More precisely, there exist zero-order elliptic (in U) h - ΨDOs on Xδ, A, A', and a zero-order elliptic h -  FIO on Xδ, U, associated to Λ, such that if we set T = UA, T' = UA', we have the relations (see Theorem 4.2 of [\cite=kn:PoV]):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where ι* deontes the restriction on x1 = 0, Qj, [formula], j = 1,2, are zero-order h - ΨDOs on ∂X, Q1 and [formula] being elliptic in a neighbourhood of {q0 = 1}, V and [formula] are zero-order h - ΨDOs on Xδ, and [formula]. One can further simplify the operator P'0 by making a new symplectic change of the tangential variables [formula] such that

[formula]

Then, in these coordinates the glancing manifold {q0 = 1} is defined by [formula]. Conjugating with a zero-order elliptic (in a neighbourhood of the glancing manifold) h - FIO operator on ∂X we get (2.8), (2.9) and (2.10) with new operators of the same type (which we will denote in the same way below) and P'0 replaced by

[formula]

where [formula] in a neighbourhood of [formula], and

[formula]

Thus we get the model operator studied in Sections 5 and 6. Indeed, given a function [formula], it is constructed a parametrix [formula] supported in 0  ≤  x1  ≤  hε such that

[formula]

[formula]

for every s  ≥  0, where M  ≫  1 is an arbitrary integer independent of h. Hereafter, the Sobolev spaces Hs will be equipped with the semi-classical norm. Moreover, by Theorem 6.6 the operator defined by

[formula]

satisfies the bound

[formula]

By (2.8), (2.9) and (2.10) (with P'0 replaced by P0) combined with (2.11) and (2.12) we obtain that the function [formula] satisfies the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Given any function f∈L2(∂X), let v solve the equation

[formula]

where the function φ is as above. Let [formula] be such that φ1 = 1 on supp  φ. Since Q1 is a zero-order h - ΨDO on ∂X, elliptic in a neighbourhood of {q0 = 1}, thete exists a zero-order h - ΨDO, [formula], elliptic on T*∂X, such that [formula] and [formula] as operators on Hs(∂X), s  ≥  0. Set

[formula]

Then, for h small enough the operator [formula] is invertible on Hs(∂X) and

[formula]

Denote by u the parametrix above with

[formula]

We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

where we have put

[formula]

We need now the following

For small h we have Z1  =  O(h∞):L2(Y)  →  L2(Y).

Proof. Given any integer m  ≥  1 we can write

[formula]

[formula]

where I denotes the identity. Hence, to prove the lemma it suffices to show that

[formula]

[formula]

for every integer k  ≥  0, and all functions φ, [formula] independent of h and such that φ1 = 1 on supp  φ. For k = 0, (2.17) follows from well-known properties of the h - ΨDOs. It is easy also to see that (2.17) with k = 1 implies (2.17) for every k  ≥  1. On the other hand, to prove (2.17) with k = 1 it suffices to prove it with [formula] in place of [formula]. This property of the operator [formula], however, follows from Theorem 6.6.   [formula]

By (2.13), (2.14) and Lemma 2.3, we get

[formula]

[formula]

while (2.15) implies

[formula]

Let us see that (2.18),(2.19) and (2.20) imply

[formula]

Denote by GD the self-adjoint Dirichlet realization of the operator -  ΔX on L2(X). We have

[formula]

[formula]

where E = O(h1 / 2):Hs(∂X)  →  Hs + 1 / 2(X), s  ≥  0, is the extension map, (Ef)|∂X = f,

[formula]

By (2.18), (2.19), with Dν =  - ih∂ν, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

provided h1 - ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, where we have used the coercivity (ellipticity) of the operator GD. Taking M big enough we deduce (2.21) from (2.20) and (2.22). Clearly, (2.21) implies (2.7).

Some properties of the Airy function

It is well-known that the Airy function Ai(z) is an entire function of order [formula] with simple zeros {νj}  ⊂  ( -   ∞  ,0), -  νj  ~  (3π / 2)2 / 3j2 / 3, and satisfying the equation

[formula]

Differentiating (3.1) k times leads to the following equation for the derivatives of the Airy function, [formula],

[formula]

It is also known that the Airy function satisfies the identities

[formula]

[formula]

where c±j are some constants and we have put

[formula]

[formula]

The functions Ai and Ai± satisfy

[formula]

In particular, this imples |Ai+(z)| = |Ai-(z)| for real z. For | arg z| < π we also have the formula

[formula]

[formula]

where z1 / 2 is taken so that Re  z1 / 2 > 0, that is,

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

The function B satisfies the asymptotic expansion

[formula]

for |z|  ≫  1, | arg z|  ≤  π  -  δ, 0 < δ  ≪  1, where [formula] and [formula] are strictly positive real numbers, [formula]. In view of (3.6), (3.7) provides an asymptotic expansion for the Airy function Ai(z). Moreover (3.7) can be differentiated a finite number of times thus getting an asymptotic expansion for Ai(k)(z). In particular, we get that for | arg z|  ≤  π  -  δ the function F(z) has the expansion

[formula]

where [formula]. Moreover, the function [formula] has the expansion obtained by differentiating (3.8) k times. The behaviour of the functions Ai(z) and F(z) for [formula] is more complicated.

For Im  z  ≠  0 and every integer k  ≥  0, we have the bound

[formula]

Proof. Given any [formula] with Im  z  ≠  0, denote [formula]. Since the function F is analytic on B(z), by the Cauchy theorem we have

[formula]

It follows from (3.10) that if (3.9) holds with k = 0, it holds for all k.

Since the function F(z) is analytic at z = 0, there exists a constant z0 > 0 such that the bound (3.9) holds trivially for |z|  ≤  z0. For | arg z|  ≤  π  -  δ, |z|  ≫  1, it follows easily from (3.8). Therefore, we may suppose that z0  ≤  |z|  ≤  z1, z1 > z0 > 0 being constants, or z∈Λδ, |z|  ≫  1. To deal with the first case we will use the Hadamard factorization theorem. Since the zeros of the Airy function are simple, we can write

[formula]

Hence we can write the function F in the form

[formula]

Since νj is real; we have

[formula]

while for |νj|  ≥  2|z| we have

[formula]

Thus we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

which gives the desired bound for |F(z)| in this case.

In the second case we will use (3.3). Let - z∈Λδ, |z|  ≫  1. Then | arg z|  ≤  δ and if [formula], we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

It suffices to consider the case Im  z > 0 since the case Im  z < 0 is similar. Then we have Im  ξ > 0. In view of (3.7), the functions B±(z) = z1 / 4e∓  iπ / 12B(e±  iπ / 3z) satisfy the asymptotics

[formula]

where b0,b1 > 0 are constants. In particular, we have

[formula]

Let us see that (3.12) implies the inequality

[formula]

To this end, observe that the first derivative of the function

[formula]

is given by

[formula]

By (3.12) we get f'(τ) > 0 as long as 0  ≤  τ  ≤  δRe  z and Re  z  ≫  1. On the other hand, in view of (3.5) we have f(0) = 0. Hence f(τ)  ≥  0 for τ  ≥  0, which proves (3.13).

By (3.6) and (3.13) we have

[formula]

It is easy to see that the above asymptotics also lead to the bounds

[formula]

with some constant C > 0. By (3.11), (3.14) and (3.15),

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Given any integer k  ≥  0, set

[formula]

where Φ- 1 = 0. Clearly, Φ0 = 1 and Φ1 =  - F.

For Im  z  ≠  0 and all integers k  ≥  1, [formula], we have the bound

[formula]

Proof. Differentiating the identity (3.16) [formula] times we get

[formula]

It is easy to see by induction in k that (3.17) follows from (3.9).   [formula]

For t  ≥  0 and [formula], | arg   z| < π, set

[formula]

For Im  z  ≠  0 and all integers k  ≥  0, [formula], we have the bound

[formula]

For t > 0, Im  z  ≠  0 and all integers k  ≥  0, [formula], we have the bound

[formula]

while for t  ≥  |z| we have

[formula]

Proof. In view of (3.10) with Ψk in place of F, it suffices to prove these bounds with [formula]. Furthermore, using (3.2) it is easy to see by induction in k that (3.9) implies the estimate

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

In particular, (3.23) implies that (3.19) and (3.21) with [formula], k  ≥  1, follows from (3.19) and (3.21) with [formula], k = 0. The same conclusion is still valid concerning the bound (3.20) as long as t  ≤  2|z|. For t  ≥  2|z|, (3.20) follows from (3.21) in view of the inequality

[formula]

Therefore, to prove the lemma we have to bound |Ψ0|. Clearly, Ψ0(0,z) = 1 which proves (3.19). To bound |Ψ0(t,z)| for t > 0, let us see that the Airy function satisfies the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

Indeed, for | arg z|  ≤  π  -  δ, (3.24) and (3.25) follow from (3.6) and (3.7), while for z∈Λδ they follow from (3.3) and (3.4) combined with Lemma 3.1. By (3.24) and (3.25),

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Hence φ  ≥  0 for t  ≥  0, while for t  ≥  |z| we have [formula]. Therefore, the desired bounds for |Ψ0| follow from (3.26).   [formula]

Some properties of the h - Ψ DOs

Let Y be an n - 1 dimensional compact manifold without boundary or an open neighbourhood in [formula]. In this section we will recall some useful criteria on a symbol a'y,η)∈T*Y for the h - Ψ DO, Oph(a), to be bounded on L2(Y). We will make use of the analysis developed in Section 7 of [\cite=kn:DS] (see also Section 2 of [\cite=kn:V]). We first have the following

Let a∈T*Y satisfy the bounds

[formula]

for |α|  ≤  n, where a0 > 0 is a parameter. Then there is a constant C > 0 independent of h such that

[formula]

This proposition follows for example from Proposition 2.1 of [\cite=kn:V]. The next proposition can be derived from the analysis in Section 7 of [\cite=kn:DS].

Let a,b∈T*Y satisfy the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

where 0  ≤  δ < 1, for all multi-indices α and β with constants Cα,Cα,β > 0 independent of h, and M0 > 0 independent of h and α. Then for every integer M  ≫  M0 there is a constant CM > 0 independent of h such that

[formula]

Proof. In view of formula (7.15) of [\cite=kn:DS] the operator in the left-hand side of (4.5) whose norm we would like to bound is an h-psdo with symbol c(x,ξ,x,ξ), where the function c is given by

[formula]

where we have put D =  - i∂. The inequality (7.17) of [\cite=kn:DS] together with (4.3) and (4.4) yield the estimate

[formula]

[formula]

for s > (n - 1) / 2. Similarly, for all multi-indices α and β, we have

[formula]

By (4.7) we get

[formula]

By Proposition 4.1 and (4.8), with some [formula] depending only on the dimension, we conclude

[formula]

if M is taken large enough.   [formula]

Parametrix construction for the model equation

Let the parameters h and μ be as in Section 2, h1 - 2ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, 0 < ε  ≪  1. Let also Y be as in Section 4. Consider the operator

[formula]

where Dt =  - ih∂t, Dy =  - ih∂y, y∈Y, the function q∈C∞(T*Y), q∈S00, is real-valued and does not depend on t, h and μ, satisfying 0 < C1  ≤  q  ≤  C2, C1 and C2 being constants, [formula] uniformly in h and μ. Let η = (η1,η') be the dual variables of y = (y1,y'). Let also the function φ be as in Section 2. We are going to build a parametrix, [formula], for the solution u of the equation

[formula]

where f1 is microlocally suppoted in the region [formula]. We will first construct a parametrix in the region

[formula]

More precisely, in this section we will construct a parametrix, [formula], of the solution of the equation (5.1) with [formula], f∈L2(Y) being arbitrary. The construction in the region [formula] will be carried out in the next section.

We will be looking for [formula] in the form

[formula]

where g∈L2(Y) will be determined later on such that [formula], and

[formula]

[formula]

Ψk being the functions introduced in Section 3, M is an arbitrary integer, a0  =  φ1(η1|μ| / h1 + ε), [formula] being such that φ1 = 1 on supp  φ, while ak, k  ≥  1, do not depend on the variable t and will be determined later on. Observe first that we have

[formula]

[formula]

It is easy to see that (3.2) implies the identity

[formula]

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

Using the identity

[formula]

we can also write

[formula]

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

[formula]

where a- 1 = 0 and we have put

[formula]

Set

[formula]

For t = 0, all k  ≥  0 and multi-indices α, we have the bound

[formula]

For all t > 0, k  ≥  0 and multi-indices α, we have the bound

[formula]

Moreover, there exists a constant C > 0 such that for C(|μ| + |η1|)  ≤  t  ≤  1 we have the bound

[formula]

We also have the bound

[formula]

Proof. It is easy to see by induction that

[formula]

[formula]

with some function cα,j independent of t, h and μ, cα,0 = 0 for |α|  ≥  1. Recall that q  ≥  C1 > 0. Now (5.6)-(5.8) follow from Lemma 3.3 and (5.10). The bound (5.9) follows from (3.9) and (5.10) applied with [formula] in place of Ψk.   [formula]

Set

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We have the identities

[formula]

where the functions [formula] do not depend on aν, ψν, and satisfy the bounds [formula] for all multi-indices β uniformly in μ and h.

Proof. Using the identity

[formula]

[formula]

together with (5.10), we get the identity,

[formula]

where we have put

[formula]

As in the proof of Lemma 5.1, one can deduce from Lemma 3.2 that [formula]. Therefore, using (5.12) we can write

[formula]

[formula]

with functions [formula] independent of ak, ψk, and satisfying the bounds [formula]. Moreover, when |α|  ≥  1 we have [formula] for j = 0 in (5.12), and hence in this case [formula]. Since (5.2) implies |μ|2  ≤  h, it is easy to see that (5.13) implies (5.11).   [formula]

We let now the functions ak satisfy the equations

[formula]

[formula]

Set

[formula]

For all integers k  ≥  0 and all multi-indices α, we have the bound

[formula]

Proof. In view of Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, differentiating (5.14) we get

[formula]

Since (5.15) is trivially fulfilled for k = 0, it is easy to see by induction in k that (5.16) implies (5.15) for all k.   [formula]

With this choice of the functions ak the identity (5.3) becomes

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

Combining Lemmas 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 leads to the following

For t = 0, all k  ≥  0 and multi-indices α, we have the bound

[formula]

For all t  ≥  0, k  ≥  0 and multi-indices α, we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, there exists a constant C > 0 such that for C(|μ| + |η1|)  ≤  t  ≤  1 we have the bound

[formula]

Observe now that the condition (5.2) implies

[formula]

[formula]

Using Lemma 5.4 together with (5.22) we will prove the following

For all s  ≥  0, we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. In view of (5.17) we can write

[formula]

By (5.19) we have [formula], [formula], and hence by Proposition 4.2 we get the bound

[formula]

By (5.20) and (5.22) we have [formula], [formula], and hence by Proposition 4.1 we get the bound

[formula]

On the other hand, since (5.2) implies |μ| + |η1|  ≤  h2ε, taking h small enough we can arrange that t  ≥  C(|μ| + |η1|) as long as [formula]. Therefore, we can use (5.21) to conclude that for t  ~  hε we have the bounds [formula], [formula], with some constant c > 0. Thus, Proposition 4.1 yields the bound

[formula]

Now (5.23) follows from (5.26)-(5.29) by taking M big enough, depending on ε. Since ψ0 = 1 for t = 0, the bound (5.24) follows from (5.18), (5.22) and Proposition 4.1. The proof of (5.25) is similar, in view of the identity

[formula]

Indeed, by (5.6), (5.15), (5.22) and (5.30), we have [formula], [formula]. Therefore, since ρ1  =  O(hε), we get (5.25) by Proposition 4.1.   [formula]

Set Z = Oph(A(0) - a0). Since the estimate (5.24) holds for every g∈L2(Y), we have Z = O(hε / 2):L2(Y)  →  L2(Y). Hence the operator I + Z is invertible on L2(Y) for small h. Given any f∈L2(Y), take now

[formula]

With this choice of g we have

[formula]

where we have put

[formula]

Thus, to complete the parametrix construction in this case we have to prove the following

For small h we have Z1  =  O(h∞):L2(Y)  →  L2(Y).

Proof. Given any integer m  ≥  1 we can write

[formula]

Hence, to prove the lemma it suffices to show that

[formula]

for every integer k  ≥  0. Clearly, (5.31) holds trivially for k = 0. It is easy also to see that (5.31) with k = 1 implies (5.31) for every k  ≥  1. On the other hand, since

[formula]

and φ1 = 1 on supp  φ, (5.31) with k = 1 follows from Proposition 4.2.   [formula]

Thus, by Proposition 5.5 we get that the parametrix [formula] has the following properties.

For all s  ≥  0, we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Parametrix construction in the region G2(ε)

In this section we will construct a parametrix, [formula], of the solution of the equation (5.1) with f1  =  Oph(φ2(η1))f, where [formula] is such that on supp  φ2 we have

[formula]

[formula]

Let ρ be the solution to the equation

[formula]

with Im  ρ > 0. We will be looking for [formula] in the form

[formula]

[formula]

where φ is the same function as in the previous section, δ1 > 0 is a small constant to be fixed later on, a = φ2(η1), φ = 0 for t = 0. The phase φ is independent of h and is of the form

[formula]

where φk do not depend on t, M  ≫  1 being an arbitrary but fixed integer. The amplitude a is of the form

[formula]

where the functions ak,ν do not depend on t. Note that the identity (5.3) still holds with the new function A = φ(t / |ρ|2δ1)eiφ / ha. Moreover, we have the identity

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Let Ej(t), Ej(t), j = 1,2 be defined as in the previous section with the new A. Given a multi-index α = (α1,...,αn - 1), set

[formula]

The phase satisfies the eikonal equation

[formula]

where RM(t) = O(tM + 1) as t  →  0. It is easy to see that we have the identities

[formula]

[formula]

where γα1,...,αj,k1,...,kj are constants. Thus, if we choose φk satisfying the equations

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where ε1 = 1, εK = 0 for K  ≥  2, then φ satisfies the equation (6.4) with

[formula]

[formula]

Clearly, φ1  =  ρ is a solution of (6.5). Then, given φ1, ..., φK, K  ≥  1, we can determine φK + 1 uniquely from (6.6).

For all integers k  ≥  2 and all multi-indices α we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

We also have the bound

[formula]

Moreover, if 0 < t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2 with a constant δ1 > 0 small enough, we have

[formula]

Proof. The bound (6.7) with k = 1 follows easily by induction in |α| from the identity

[formula]

for |α|  ≥  1, γα1,α2  ≠  0 being some constants, together with the fact that μ  =  O(|ρ|2). The proof of (6.9) is similar, using that

[formula]

together with the identity

[formula]

for |α|  ≥  1. To prove (6.7) for all k  ≥  2 and all multi-indices α we will proceed by induction in k + |α|. Suppose first that (6.7) holds for all k  ≤  K. Then the right-hand side of (6.6) is [formula]. Thus by (6.6) we get that ρφK + 1  =  O(|ρ|2 - 2K), which is the desired bound for φK + 1. To bound ∂αyφK + 1 we apply the operator ∂αy to the equation (6.6) and proceed in the same way. The proof of (6.8) is similar, using that |μ|  ≤  C|ρ|Im  ρ together with the inequality

[formula]

To prove (6.10) we use (6.8) to obtain, for 0 < t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2,

[formula]

[formula]

provided δ1 is taken small enough.   [formula]

Set

[formula]

[formula]

We have the identities

[formula]

where the functions [formula] do not depend on t, h and the functions ak,ν, and satisfy the bounds

[formula]

for every multi-index β.

Proof. We will first prove by induction in |α| the identity

[formula]

with functions cα,k,ν independent of t, h and satisfying the bounds

[formula]

for every multi-index β. Let α  =  α1  +  α2 with |α1| = 1 and suppose (6.13) fulfilled with α2. Then we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Hence (6.13) holds for α1  +  α2 with

[formula]

It follows from (6.7) and (6.15) that if (6.14) holds with α2, it holds with α1  +  α2, which proves the assertion.

Using (6.13) we can write

[formula]

[formula]

It follows from this identity and (6.14) that the functions [formula] are of the form

[formula]

with functions [formula] independent of t, h and a, and satisfying the bounds [formula], [formula]. Now (6.11) follows from (6.16) with

[formula]

[formula]

We let now the functions ak,ν satisfy the equations

[formula]

[formula]

a0,0  =  φ2(η1), ak,0 = 0 for k  ≥  1, a- 1,ν = 0, ν  ≥  0. Let K,J  ≥  0 be any integers. Now it is clear that, given ak,ν for k  ≤  K, [formula], and aK + 1,ν for ν  ≤  J, we can determine aK + 1,J + 1 from (6.17). Therefore, by (6.17) we can find all ak,ν. Moreover, using (6.7) and (6.12) one can easily prove the following

For all integers k,ν  ≥  0 and all multi-indices α we have the bounds

[formula]

In view of (6.3) and (6.11), in this case we still have the identity (5.17) with a function B of the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Lemmas 6.1 and 6.3 imply the following

For all multi-indices α we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. Note first that the condition (6.1) implies

[formula]

with some constants C1,C2 > 0. By (6.7), (6.18) and (6.21) we have, for 0  ≤  t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2,

[formula]

[formula]

where we have used that |ρ|Im  ρ  ≥  C|μ| with some constant C > 0. In the same way, since e- iφ / h(h∂y)α(eiφ / h) = Oα(1) for 0  ≤  t  ≤  1, one can get that for any multi-index α and for 0  ≤  t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2,

[formula]

It follows easily from (6.23) that, for 0  ≤  t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2,

[formula]

On the other hand, for [formula], we have

[formula]

with some constants c1,c2 > 0. In view of (6.9) we have ∂αyφ(t / |ρ|2δ1) = Oα(1), [formula], and [formula], [formula]. Therefore, by (6.23) and (6.25) we obtain

[formula]

with some constant c > 0. Thus (6.19) follows from (6.24) and (6.26).

To prove (6.20) we need to improve the estimate (6.23) when |α|  ≥  1. To this end, observe that by Lemma 6.1 we have ∂αyφ  =  Oα(t|ρ|) = Oα(|ρ|3), [formula], for 0  ≤  t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2. Therefore, by induction in |α| one easily gets

[formula]

By (6.2), (6.10) and (6.27), for 0  ≤  t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2,

[formula]

On the other hand, by (6.18) we have ∂αya = Oα(1) for 0  ≤  t  ≤  δ1|ρ|2. Therefore, (6.20) follows from (6.28).   [formula]

Lemma 6.4 implies the following

For all s  ≥  0, we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

Proof. By Proposition 4.1 and (6.19), there is [formula] dpending only on the dimension such that [formula], [formula], while by Proposition 4.2 and (6.20) we have [formula], [formula]. This implies (6.29) in view of the identity (5.17).

To prove (6.30), observe that

[formula]

In view of (6.2) and (6.7), we have ∂αyρ  =  Oα(|ρ|) = Oα(hε), and hence by Proposition 4.1 we get Oph(ρ) = Oα(hε):L2(Y)  →  L2(Y). Furthermore, by (6.18) we also have hk + 1∂αyak,1  =  Oα(|ρ|) = Oα(hε), and we apply once again Proposition 4.1 to get (6.30).   [formula]

To complete the construction of our parametrix [formula] we will consider two cases.

Case 1. h(1 + ε) / 2  ≤  |μ|  ≤  hε, 0 < ε  ≪  1. Then the condition (6.1) is fulfilled for all η1. We take [formula], where [formula] is the parametrix constructed above with φ2(η1) = φ(η1 / hε). Clearly the condition (6.2) is fullfiled as long as η1∈supp  φ2.

Case 2. h1 - 2ε  ≤  |μ|  ≤  h(1 + ε) / 2. Then (μ,η1)∈G1(ε) as long as η1∈supp  φ(η1|μ| / h1 + ε). We take [formula], where [formula] is the parametrix constructed in Section 5 and [formula] is the parametrix constructed in Section 6 with φ2(η1) = φ(η1 / hε) - φ(η1|μ| / h1 + ε). Clearly η1  =  O(hε) on supp  φ2, and hence the condition (6.2) is fulfilled in this case. Moreover, if (μ,η1)∈G2(ε), then

[formula]

Hence, with this choice of the function φ2, the condition (6.1) is satisfied (with ε / 2 in place of ε) as long as η1∈supp  φ2.

In both cases the operator [formula] defined by [formula] provides a parametrix for the DN map f  →  Dtu|t = 0, where u is the solution to the equation (5.1) with u|t = 0  =  Oph(φ(η1 / hε))f. It follows from Theorem 5.7 and Proposition 6.5 that [formula] and [formula] have the following properties.

For all s  ≥  0, we have the bounds

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] is independent of h and μ, and φ1 = 1 on supp  φ.

Note that the estimate (6.34) follows from Proposition 4.2 in the same way as in the proof of Lemma 5.6.

Eigenvalue-free regions

In this section we will study the problem

[formula]

where 0 < h  ≪  1, z = 1 + i  Im  z, 0 < |Im  z|  ≤  1. Denote by Nj(h,z), j = 1,2, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map corresponding to the Laplacian [formula] introduced in Section 2 (with μ  =  Im  z). In this section we will prove the following

Under the conditions of Theorem 1.1, given any 0 < ε  ≪  1 there is h0(ε) > 0 so that the operator

[formula]

is invertible for 0 < h  ≤  h0, |Im  z|  ≥  h1 - ε.

Proof. We may suppose that |Im  z|  ≤  hε since for hε  ≤  |Im  z|  ≤  1 the theorem is proved in [\cite=kn:V]. Let ΔΓ be the negative Laplace-Beltrami operator on Γ with the Riemannian metric induced by the Euclidean one in [formula]. Denote by r0(x',ξ') the principal symbol of -  ΔΓ written in the coordinates (x',ξ')∈T*Γ. Set [formula], where mj denotes the restriction on Γ of the function nj / cj. It is easy to see that the conditions (1.2) and (1.3) imply [formula], provided h is taken small enough. Throughout this section, ρj, j = 1,2, will denote the solution to the equation

[formula]

with Im  ρ > 0. Observe that

[formula]

where [formula] and c0 are the restrictions on Γ of the functions

[formula]

respectively. Clearly, under the conditions of Theorem 1.1, we have [formula], [formula]. Moreover, (1.2) implies [formula], while (1.3) implies c0(x') < 0, [formula]. Hence, under the conditions of Theorem 1.1, we have c21ρ21  ≠  c22ρ22 on Γ as |Im  z|  →  0. It is easy to see that |ρj|  ≥  Const > 0 on Σ3 - j(ε), j = 1,2. Let [formula], χ(j)ε = 1 on Σj(ε), χ(j)ε = 0 outside a larger O(hε / 2) neighbourhood of {r0 = mj}. Then we have [formula].

By (7.2) we also have

[formula]

where k =  - 1 if (1.2) holds, k = 1 if (1.3) holds. Since χ(j)ερj  =  O(hε / 4), (7.3) remains valid with [formula] in place of ρj. Using this we will prove the following

Under the conditions of Theorem 1.1, we have the estimate

[formula]

for 0 < h  ≤  h0, |Im  z|  ≥  h1 - ε.

Proof. Let χ∈C∞0(T*Γ), χ = 1 on {r0  ≤  R0} with some constant R0  ≫  1. The estimate (7.4) with f replaced by Oph(1 - χ)f is proved, under the conditions (1.2) and (1.3), in Section 5 of [\cite=kn:V] (see also [\cite=kn:PV]). Therefore, to prove (7.4) it suffices to show that

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula] on Σj(ε), be such that [formula]. Then (7.5) with [formula] in place of χ follows from the estimate (2.7) of Theorem 2.2, while (7.5) with [formula] in place of χ follows from the estimates (2.4) and (2.5) of Theorem 2.1.   [formula]

Thus we have reduced the problem to that one of inverting the operator [formula]. This, however, is much easier since the symbol [formula] is elliptic in view of (7.3). Hence [formula] and there exists an inverse [formula]. Then (7.4) yields

[formula]

which after taking h small enough becomes

[formula]

Clearly, (7.6) implies the invertibility of the operator T in the desired region.   [formula]
