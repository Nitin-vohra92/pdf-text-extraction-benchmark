Finitely balanced sequences and plasticity of 1-dimensional tilings

Introduction and statement of result

Spaces of bi-infinite sequences are closely related to spaces of 1-dimensional tilings. Given a tiling, one can construct a sequence by looking at the labels of the tiles. Given a sequence, one can construct a tiling by associating a tile of length [formula] to each letter of type ai, and by concatenating these tiles in the order given by the sequence.

More precisely, let Ξ be a space of bi-infinite sequences on a finite alphabet [formula], and let [formula] be a vector of positive lengths. We then construct a space [formula] of tilings obtained by associating each letter ai with a tile of label i and length [formula]. [formula] admits a natural [formula] action from translation, while Ξ only admits a natural [formula] action obtained from powers of the shift map.

A natural question is how mixing or spectral properties of the [formula] action on Ξ are related to analogous properties of the [formula] action on [formula]. When [formula], this is a simple question, since the spectrum of translations on [formula] is simply ([formula] times) the log of the spectrum of the shift operator on Ξ. However, in some tiling spaces changing [formula] can qualitatively change the dynamics, while in others it cannot.

Part of this question was studied in [\cite=CS1] [\cite=CS2], and is related to the ( Cech) cohomology of [formula]. Changes in the lengths of the tiles are associated with elements of [formula]. There is a subgroup [formula] of asymptotically negligible length changes, i.e., changes that yield tiling spaces (and [formula] actions) that are topologically conjugate to the original action on [formula]. Furthermore, a uniform rescaling of all the tiles, while not a topological conjugacy, does not change the qualitative mixing and spectral properties. If [formula] is a large enough subspace of [formula], then all length changes are a combination of a uniform rescaling and a topological conjugacy. This happens, for instance, for holomogical Pisot substitutions [\cite=HPC].

We call a 1-dimensional tiling space (or the corresponding space of sequences) plastic if all changes to lengths of the n basic tiles result in topological conjugacies, up to an overall scale. We call it totally plastic if this remains true for all finite recodings of the tiles. (E.g. collaring, or dividing a tile into multiple pieces, or amalgamating tiles.) Plasticity may be a property of how we label our tiles, but total plasticity is topological. A tiling space is totally plastic if and only if [formula].

The space of Fibonacci sequences is generated by the substitution σ(a) = ab, σ(b) = a. The corresponding space of tilings was shown in [\cite=RS] to be plastic. To see this, suppose that [formula] and [formula] are Fibonacci tiling spaces corresponding to length vectors [formula] and [formula]. By rescaling [formula] or [formula], we can suppose that [formula], where [formula] is the golden mean. This implies that [formula] is a left-eigenvector of the substitution matrix [formula] with eigenvalue 1 - φ, and hence that the difference in length between n-th order supertiles σn(a) in [formula] and [formula] goes to zero as n  →    ∞  , and likewise for σn(b). Let [formula] be a map the preserves the underlying sequence, and such that if the origin lies a fraction f across an n-th order supertile in a tiling T, then the origin lies the same fraction f across the corresponding supertile in ψn(T). The tilings ψn(T) all agree up to translation, and the limiting tiling ψ(T): =  lim n  →    ∞ψn(T) is well-defined. Then ψ is a topological conjugacy. (For a more complete description of this conjugacy, see [\cite=RS] or [\cite=TilingsBook].)

Finitely balanced words

Let Ξ be a space of sequences. The set of all finite words that appear within the sequences of Ξ is called the language of Ξ, and is denoted L.

For each letter ai and each integer n > 0, let mi(n) be the minimum number of times that ai can appear in a word of length n in L, and let Mi(n) be the maximum number of times that ai can appear. If there is a constant C such that Mi(n) - mi(n)  <  C for all i and all n, then we say that the language L is finitely balanced.

In a Sturmian sequence, the alphabet A consists of two letters a1 = a and a2 = b, and bb is not in the language. We then have m1(2) = 1 and M1(2) = 2, since any word of length 2 contains either one or two a's. In fact, Sturmian sequences have Mi(n) - mi(n) = 1 for all i and n.

We can look for variations in the appearance not only of letters, but of words. Let w∈L, and let mw(n) (resp. Mw(n)) be the minimum (resp. maximum) number of times that w can appear in a word of length n. If for each word w there is a constant Cw such that Mw(n) - mw(n) < Cw for all n, then we say that L is totally finitely balanced.

The space of Thue-Morse sequences, coming from the substitution φ(a) = ab, φ(b)  =  ba, is finitely balanced but not totally finitely balanced. We have M1(n) - m1(n)  ≤  2 for all n, and likewise M2(n) - m2(n)  ≤  2, since all letters of a word (excepting possibly the first and/or last letter) pair into sub-words ab or ba. However, for words w of length 2, Mw(n) - mw(n) is unbounded. On average, 2/3 of the 2-letter words in a Thue-Morse sequence are ab or ba, while 1/3 are aa or bb, but the language admits words of the form [formula], of length [formula], that have m / 3 too many ab's and ba's and m / 3 too few aa's and bb's.

Plasticity can allow us to combine insights from sequences and tilings to understand the dynamics of both. To date, this has mostly applied to substitution sequences (see e.g., [\cite=Que] [\cite=Fogg]) and substitution tilings. Substitution tilings have a natural set of lengths that make the tilings self-similar, and a great deal of work, beginning with [\cite=Sol], has been done on the dynamics of self-similar tilings. Some substitution sequences (especially those coming from Pisot substitutions) are known to be plastic, but others are not. Recently, there has been interesting work (see [\cite=Berthe] and references therein) on S-adic sequence spaces. This paper arose from an observation that the balancing conditions used in [\cite=Berthe] are exactly the conditions needed for plasticity.

A space Ξ of bi-infinite sequences is plastic if and only if its language L is finitely balanced. Furthermore, Ξ is totally plastic if and only if L is totally finitely balanced.

Subshifts and Tilings

In this section we review the formalism of 1 dimensional subshifts and tilings, in preparation for the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainthm] in Section 3. All of the material of this section is standard, and details may be found in reference books such as [\cite=Lind] [\cite=Fogg] [\cite=TilingsBook].

Let A be a finite set of symbols, called an alphabet, and let A* be the set of finite words constructed from the letters of A. Then [formula] is the set of bi-infinite sequences [formula], with each ui∈A. There is a natural shift action on [formula], denoted σ:

[formula]

We give [formula] a metric where two sequences are ε-close if they agree on

[formula]

together with the label i. Translating a tile means translating the interval (say, to

[formula]

, up to translations of each tiling by up to ε. A tiling space is a non-empty set of tilings that is closed in this topology and invariant under translation. As with subshifts, the simplest examples of tiling spaces are closures of translational orbits of individual tilings, and we denote the orbit closure of T by ΩT.

Suspensions

Let Ξ be a subshift with alphabet A. The suspension of Ξ is the mapping cylinder of σ, namely:

[formula]

This can be viewed as a tiling space where the set of labels is precisely A, and where each tile has length 1. The point (u,t) consists of a tiling where a tile of label um occupies the interval

[formula]

, a tile of type u1 occupies the interval

[formula]

Pattern-Equivariant Cohomology

Let T be a 1-dimensional tiling. We can view this as a decomposition of [formula] into 1-cells (tiles) and 0-cells (vertices). A real-valued 0-cochain is an assignment of a real number to each vertex, and a real-valued 1-cochain is an assignment of a real number to each tile. If α is a 0-cochain, then δα is the coboundary of α. That is, if t is a tile occupying the interval

[formula]

δ α(t) := α (∂ t) = α(b)-α(a).

[formula]

, then α(c1) = α(c2).

The first (strongly) PE cohomology of T, with real coefficients, is

[formula]

The following theorem, originally proved by [\cite=KP] for real coefficients and extended to arbitrary coefficients in [\cite=integer], relates PE cohomology to Cech cohomology.

The PE cohomology of T is naturally isomorphic to the Cech cohomology of ΩT.

In particular, if a tiling space is minimal, then the PE cohomology is the same for all tilings in that space. We then speak of the PE cohomology of the space, rather than the PE cohomology of any specific tiling.

A cochain is called weakly pattern equivariant (wPE) if it is the uniform limit of sPE cochains. That is, α is wPE if for each ε > 0 there exists a radius R such that the value of α on a cell is determined, to within ε, by the pattern of the tiling within distance R of that cell.

There is a canonical 1-cochain that associates each tile to its length. Changes to the lengths of tiles are associated with changes to this 1-cochain, and hence to an element of H1PE. Conversely, elements of H1PE can be represented by sPE 1-cochains. After relabeling tiles according to the patterns around them (a process called "collaring", which expands the alphabet but does not change the tiling space as a dynamical system), every sufficiently small element of H1PE can be associated with a length change. In fact,

Sufficiently small length changes, up to local equivalence ('MLD'), are parametrized by H1PE.

Some of these length changes induce topological conjugacies. The subgroup of H1PE that does so is denoted H1an (for asymptotically negligible), and is neatly described by a theorem of Kellendonk [\cite=Kel2]:

H1an consists of the classes of sPE 1-cochains that can be written as the coboundaries of wPE 0-cochains.

The Gottschalk-Heldlund Theorem [\cite=GH] relates bounded integrals to continuity in an abstract setting. The following theorem was proved for tilings in all dimensions in [\cite=KS], but in one dimension is in fact an immediate corollary of the Gottschalk-Hedlund Theorem.

Let β be a sPE 1-cochain. An integral α of β is wPE if and only if α is bounded.

Proof of Main Theorem

We first prove the part of the theorem concerning finitely balanced sequences, and then prove the analogous statements for totally finitely balanced sequences.

Suppose that we have a subshift Ξ whose language is finitely balanced. Then each letter ai has a well-defined frequency fi, and there is a constant C such that

[formula]

Now consider a 1-cochain βi on a corresponding tiling (with lengths [formula] that evaluates to 1 - fi on each tile of type i and to - fi on each tile that is not of type i. Note that βi is sPE. Pick an integral αi of βi that equals 0 at a vertex. Equation [\ref=lowhi] implies that αi takes values between - C and C, and hence by Theorem [\ref=thm24] that αi is wPE. Thus, by Theorem [\ref=thm23], changing the lengths of the tiles by a multiple of βi induces a topological conjugacy of tiling spaces.

Let [formula] be any vector of positive lengths for the alphabet. We can write [formula] as a positive multiple c of [formula] plus a linear combination of the βi's. The length change from [formula] to [formula] can then be expressed as an overall scaling by c followed by a sequence of topological conjugacies, implying that Ξ is plastic.

Conversely, suppose that there is a letter ai for which equation ([\ref=lowhi]) does not apply for any choice of C and fi. An arbitrary rescaling, followed by changing the length [formula], cannot yield a 1-cochain whose integral is bounded. Thus changing the length of the i-th tile type cannot be written as a combination of a topological conjugacy and an overall rescaling.

Next suppose that Ξ is totally finitely balanced. For a given word w, let αw be an indicator 1-cochain on a corresponding tiling, taking the value 1 on a particular tile of each occurrence of w and taking the value 0 on all other tiles. An equation analogous to ([\ref=lowhi]) then applies, with fi replaced by the density of the word w and C replaced by Cw. Since every sPE 1-cochain is a finite linear combination of indicator cochains, any sPE 1-cochain whose average value is 0 must have a bounded integral, and so must have a wPE integral, and so must describe a length change that is a topological conjugacy. Thus any length change, after arbitrary collaring, can be written as a combination of an overall rescaling and a topological conjugacy.

Finally, suppose that Ξ is not totally finitely balanced, and that w is a word for which the analogue to ([\ref=lowhi]) does not apply. Collar the tiles so that their labels contain information of a region of size at least the length of w. Consider a length change wherein the first tile of each occurrence of w is lengthened and all other tiles are unchanged. That is, the change in [formula] is described by an indicator cochain of w. By the failure of ([\ref=lowhi]), this cochain is not a linear combination of the constant cochain 1 and a cochain whose integral is wPE (hence bounded), and so the length change is not a combination of a rescaling and a topological conjugacy.
