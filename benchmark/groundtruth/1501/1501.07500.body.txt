On The Langlands parameter of a Simple Supercuspidal Representation: Odd Orthogonal Groups

Introduction

Let [formula] be a connected reductive group defined over a p-adic field F. Recently, Gross, Reeder, and Yu [\cite=GR10] [\cite=RY13] have constructed a class of supercuspidal representations of [formula], called simple supercuspidal representations. These are the supercuspidal representations of G of minimal positive depth.

Of interest is the Langlands correspondence for simple supercuspidal representations of G. Recall that the Langlands correspondence (or LLC) is a certain conjectural finite-to-one map

[formula]

from equivalence classes of irreducible admissible representations of G to equivalence classes of Langlands parameters of G. In the past several years there has been much activity on the Langlands correspondence. DeBacker and Reeder [\cite=DR09] have constructed a correspondence for depth zero supercuspidal representations of unramified p-adic groups, and Reeder [\cite=R08] extended this construction to certain positive depth supercuspidal representations of unramified groups. Recently, under a mild assumption on the residual characteristic, Kaletha [\cite=K13] has constructed a correspondence for simple supercuspidal representations of p-adic groups, and has verified that his correspondence satisfies many of the expected properties of the Langlands correspondence. Kaletha has subsequently [\cite=K15] extended these results to epipelagic supercuspidal representations of p-adic groups.

Our present work is the first in a series of papers dedicated to explicitly determining the Langlands parameter φπ of a simple supercuspidal representation π of a classical group G, using the theory of gamma factors. Let π and τ be a pair of irreducible representations of G and GLn, where G is either [formula], [formula] or [formula]. Here, we assume that [formula] is split and [formula] is quasi-split. Fix a nontrivial character ψ of F. The Rankin-Selberg integral for G  ×  GLn was constructed, in different settings, in a series of works including [\cite=GPSR87] [\cite=G90] [\cite=GPSR97] [\cite=GRS98] [\cite=Sou93]. If G is orthogonal, we denote this Rankin-Selberg integral by Φ(W,fs), and Φ(W,φ,fs) otherwise. Here, W is a Whittaker function for π, fs is a certain holomorphic section of a principal series (induced from τ) depending on the complex parameter s, and φ is a Schwartz function. Applying a standard normalized intertwining operator M*(τ,s) to fs, one obtains a similar integral Φ*(W,fs)  =  Φ(W,M*(τ,s)fs) if G is orthogonal (and Φ*(W,φ,fs)  =  Φ(W,φ,M*(τ,s)fs) otherwise) related to Φ(W,fs) (or Φ(W,φ,fs)) by a functional equation

[formula]

For an accessible paper discussing all of these functional equations, we refer the reader to the recent work of Kaplan [\cite=K14ii].

The term γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ) is known as the gamma factor of π  ×  τ, and is the key ingredient in determining φπ in this paper. To determine φπ, one must locate the poles of the gamma factors γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ) where τ ranges over the supercuspidal representations of various general linear groups. The location of poles will determine the isobaric constituents of a specific functorial lift Π to a general linear group GL, the lift corresponding to the standard L-homomorphism [formula] (see [\cite=ACS14]). In the case of simple supercuspidal representations π of a classical group G, it is expected that the isobaric constituents of Π are either tamely ramified characters of GL1, or simple supercuspidal representations (for p large, this can be seen from the so-called "depth-preserving conjecture"; see §[\ref=depthpreservation]). We can then use the explicit local Langlands correspondence for simple supercuspidal representations of general linear groups (see [\cite=AL14] [\cite=BH10] [\cite=BH13]) to determine φπ.

While describing the Langlands correspondence explicitly is in general a difficult task, in the simple supercuspidal setting it turns out to be tractable. To explain our approach, we first make some observations. If π is a simple supercuspidal representation of a classical group, it is expected (as remarked earlier) that its Langlands parameter φπ decomposes as an irreducible subrepresentation φπ,1 (that corresponds to a simple supercuspidal representation of a general linear group under LLC) and a (possibly empty) direct sum φπ,2 of tamely ramified one-dimensional subrepresentations. Using this prediction as our guide, we can describe our method to fully determine φπ in two steps. The first is to compute the gamma factor γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ), where τ is any tamely ramified character of GL1. This computation will determine φπ,2. By multiplicativity of gamma factors, it will also yield a prediction for a specific simple supercuspidal representation σ (whose associated Langlands parameter is φπ,1) that is an isobaric constituent of Π, leading to step two. In step two, one computes γ(s,π  ×  σ,ψ) in order to prove that σ is indeed such a constituent. We can then use LLC for simple supercuspidal representations of general linear groups to determine φπ,1.

We now give more details on these steps in the case of [formula], which is the central concern of this paper. The simple supercuspidal representations of G are parameterized by two pieces of data: a choice of a uniformizer ϖ in F, and a sign. More explicitly (see §[\ref=simplesupercuspidalsoddorthogonal]), let χ be an affine generic character of the pro-unipotent radical I+ of an Iwahori I. The choice of a uniformizer ϖ in F determines an element gχ in G which normalizes I and stabilizes χ. We can extend χ to K  =  〈gχ〉I+ in two different ways, since g2χ  =  1, and [formula] is simple supercuspidal.

Let τ be a tamely ramified character of GL1. Our main result (Theorem [\ref=gammafactor]) is

[formula]

In particular, since there are no poles in γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ), there can be no tamely ramified character of the Weil group WF appearing as a summand of φπ. In particular, it is therefore expected that φπ is irreducible. Therefore, on the one hand, the computation of γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ) determines no part of φπ. On the other hand, it does tell us precisely what the Langlands parameter should be, as follows.

By the results of [\cite=AL14] [\cite=BH13] (see in particular [\cite=AL14]), there exists a unique irreducible [formula]-dimensional representation [formula] with trivial determinant, whose gamma factor γ(s,φ  ×  τ,ψ) equals χ(gχ)τ( - ϖ)q1 / 2  -  s for every tamely ramified character τ (we give more details on this in §[\ref=whittakersection]). The Langlands parameter φ has been explicitly described in [\cite=AL14] [\cite=BH10] [\cite=BH13]. In the case that [formula], let us briefly recall this description (here we follow [\cite=AL14]).

Let ϖ be a uniformizer of F, let ϖE be a [formula] root of ϖ, and set E  =  F(ϖE). Relative to the basis

[formula]

of E / F, we have an embedding

[formula]

Define a character ξ of E× by setting [formula], where [formula], for [formula]. Moreover, we define [formula], where [formula], 1E denotes the trivial character of WE, and kF is the residue field of F. Finally, we set

[formula]

where λE / F(ψ) is the Langlands constant (see [\cite=BH06]). Then [formula]. The proof that φπ  =  φ boils down to the computation of γ(s,π  ×  Π,ψ), where Π is the simple supercuspidal representation of [formula] corresponding to φ under LLC, and will be carried out in future work. This is our "step two" described above. On the other hand, if we assume the "depth-preserving conjecture", we can easily prove (see Corollary [\ref=functoriallift]) that φπ  =  φ for p sufficiently large.

The cases of [formula] and [formula] are in some sense similar. For example, suppose that [formula]. Let π be a simple supercuspidal representation of G, and let φπ be its Langlands parameter. Again, it is expected that φπ decomposes as an irreducible subrepresentation φπ,1 (that corresponds to a simple supercuspidal representation under LLC) and a (possibly empty) direct sum φπ,2 of tamely ramified one-dimensional subrepresentations (again, for p large, this can be seen from the "depth-preserving conjecture"). It is known that all summands must be self-dual. Therefore the computation of γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ), where τ is a quadratic and tamely ramified character of GL1 will determine φπ,2. The computation of γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ), where τ is tamely ramified and not quadratic, will give a specific prediction (as in the case of [formula]) for φπ,1. Then one must perform "step two" by calculating γ(s,π  ×  Π,ψ), where Π is the unique simple supercuspidal representation (with trivial central character) of a certain general linear group such that γ(s,Π  ×  τ,ψ)  =  γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ) for all tamely ramified characters τ of GL1.

We now summarize the contents of the sections of this paper. In §[\ref=preliminaries], we recall the functional equation for odd orthogonal groups as in [\cite=Sou93]. In §[\ref=whittakersection], we recall a construction of simple supercuspidal representations of GLn as well as their tamely ramified GL1-twisted gamma factors. In §[\ref=simplesupercuspidalsoddorthogonal], we give a construction of simple supercuspidal representations of odd orthogonal groups that may be used in computing the Rankin-Selberg integrals from §[\ref=preliminaries]. In §[\ref=easyside] and §[\ref=hardside], we compute a family of Rankin-Selberg integrals that allow us to explicitly compute the tamely ramified GL1-twisted gamma factors of a simple supercuspidal representation of [formula]. The main result on the values of these gamma factors is Theorem [\ref=gammafactor], which allows us to predict the Langlands parameter of a simple supercuspidal representation of an odd orthogonal group. Finally, in §[\ref=depthpreservation], we show that if we assume a conjecture on depth preservation, then our prediction for the Langlands parameter is indeed the correct Langlands parameter.

The local functional equation for odd orthogonal groups

In this section we recall the functional equation for odd orthogonal groups, as in [\cite=Sou93].

Let [formula] denote the [formula] matrix [formula]. We define

[formula]

[formula]

Let [formula] be the split maximal torus of [formula]. Let [formula] be the standard set of simple roots of [formula], so that [formula], where εi(t)  =  ti is the i-th coordinate function of [formula]. Let [formula] be the standard maximal parabolic subgroup of [formula] corresponding to [formula]. The Levi part of [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], and we denote its unipotent radical by [formula].

Let [formula] be the split maximal torus of [formula]. let [formula] be the standard set of simple roots of [formula], so that [formula]. The highest root is ε1  +  ε2. Let [formula] denote the subgroup of upper triangular unipotent matrices.

Let ψ be a nontrivial additive character of F. We let [formula] denote the maximal unipotent subgroup of [formula] consisting of upper triangular matrices. We also denote by ψ the standard nondegenerate Whittaker character of

[formula]

for [formula].

Let τ be a generic representation of [formula]. We denote by W(τ,ψ) the Whittaker model of τ with respect to ψ.

For [formula], define

[formula]

Thus, a function fs in [formula] is a smooth function on [formula], where for any [formula], [formula], and u in the unipotent radical [formula], we have

[formula]

and the mapping a  ↦  fs(g,a) belongs to W(τ,ψ).

We now let [formula] such that [formula]. Let [formula] denote the subgroup of upper triangular unipotent matrices in [formula]. We use the notation ψ again to define a non-degenerate character on [formula] by

[formula]

Let π be a generic representation of [formula] with respect to ψ. We shall denote by W(π,ψ) the Whittaker model of π with respect to ψ. Let τ be a generic representation of GLn with respect to ψ.

In computing γ-factors, we will be interested in the following local integrals (see [\cite=Sou93]):

[formula]

where W∈W(π,ψ), fs∈VSO2nQn(W(τ,ψ- 1),s), and where dh is a fixed right-invariant Haar measure on the quotient space [formula], and [formula] is the product measure inherited from dv.

Here, [formula] is the map

[formula]

[formula]

Note that [formula] is a column vector, and [formula] is a row vector. Moreover, the notation y' means that these coordinates are determined by the coordinates of y, according to the matrix defining [formula].

Now let n be odd. We define an intertwining operator by

[formula]

where

[formula]

and where [formula] is the opposite unipotent radical to Un.

Then we will also be interested in the integrals (see [\cite=Sou93]) Φ*(W,fs), where

[formula]

Here, if g∈GLn, then [formula]. Moreover,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We then have the functional equation for odd orthogonal groups.

[formula]

The simple supercuspidal representations of GLn

In this section we review the definition of a simple supercuspidal representation of GLn, as in [\cite=AL14] (see also [\cite=KL15]). We then recall the values of a family of its twisted gamma factors, in order to predict the Langlands parameter of a simple supercuspidal of [formula].

Let [formula], Z the center of G, [formula] the standard maximal compact subgroup, I the standard Iwahori subgroup, and I+ its pro-unipotent radical. Fix a nontrivial additive character ψ of F that is trivial on [formula] and nontrivial on [formula]. Fix a uniformizer ϖ in F. Let U denote the unipotent radical of the standard upper triangular Borel subgroup of GLn. For any u∈U, we recall from §[\ref=preliminaries] the standard nondegenerate Whittaker character ψ of U:

[formula]

Set H  =  ZI+, and fix a character ω of [formula], trivial on [formula]. For [formula], we define a character [formula] by χ(zk)  =  ω(z)ψ(r1  +  r2...  +  rn - 1  +  rn) for

[formula]

The compactly induced representation [formula] is then a direct sum of n distinct irreducible supercuspidal representations of GLn. They are parameterized by ζ, where ζ is a complex [formula] root of ω(ϖ), as follows. Set

[formula]

and set H'  =  〈gχ〉H. Then the summands of πχ are

[formula]

where χζ(gjχh)  =  ζjχ(h), as ζ runs over the complex [formula] roots of ω(ϖ). The σζχ are called the simple supercuspidal representations of GLn.

Finally, for the simple supercuspidal representation σζχ, we may define a Whittaker function on GLn by setting

This function is well-defined, by definition of ψ and χζ. Using this Whittaker function, it turns out to be not so difficult to compute the Rankin-Selberg integrals that arise in the definition of the twisted gamma factors γ(s,σζχ  ×  τ,ψ), where τ is a tamely ramified character of F×. In §[\ref=simplesupercuspidalsoddorthogonal], we will define an analogous Whittaker function for a simple supercuspidal representation π of [formula], which will allow us to compute the relevant Rankin-Selberg integrals for π.

In [\cite=AL14], we explicitly computed γ(s,σζχ  ×  τ,ψ):

[\cite=AL14] Let τ be a tamely ramified character of GL1. Then

[formula]

This result allows us to conclude (see [\cite=AL14]) that a simple supercuspidal of GLn, up to central character, can be distinguished from any other supercuspidal of GLn by the above twisted γ-factors.

The simple supercuspidal representations of [formula]

In this section we construct the simple supercuspidal representations of [formula], and define an explicit Whittaker function for each simple supercuspidal.

Let [formula] denote the split maximal torus of [formula]. Associated to T we have the set of affine roots Ψ. Let X*(T) denote the character lattice of T, let T0 be the maximal compact subgroup of T0, and set

[formula]

To each α∈Ψ we have an associated affine root group Uα in G. Associated to the standard set of simple roots [formula] we have a set of simple affine Π and positive affine roots Ψ+. Set

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

In terms of the Moy-Prasad filtration, if x denotes the barycenter of the fundamental alcove, then [formula], and [formula].

For [formula], we define a character

[formula]

[formula]

for h  =  (h)ij∈I+. These χ's are called the affine generic characters of I+ (see [\cite=GR10] [\cite=RY13]). The orbits of affine generic characters are parameterized by the set of elements in [formula], as follows. [formula] normalizes I+, so acts on the set of affine generic characters by conjugation. Every orbit of affine generic characters contains one of the form (1,1,...,1,t), for [formula]. Specifically, the orbit of [formula] contains (1,1,...,1,t), where [formula].

Instead of viewing the affine generic characters as parameterized by [formula], we will set t  =  1 and let the affine generic characters be parameterized by the various choices of uniformizer in F. Since we have already fixed an (arbitrary) uniformizer ahead of time in §[\ref=notation], we have therefore fixed an affine generic character χ. The compactly induced representation [formula] is a direct sum of 2 distinct irreducible supercuspidal representations of [formula]. They are parameterized ζ∈{ - 1,1}, as follows. Set

[formula]

One can compute that gχ normalizes I+, and that [formula]. Set H'  =  〈gχ〉I+. Since g2χ  =  1, we may extend χ to a character of H' in two different ways by mapping gχ to ζ∈{ - 1,1}. Then the summands of πχ are the compactly induced representations

[formula]

where χζ(gχh)  =  ζ  ·  χ(h), where ζ∈{ - 1,1} and h∈I+. The πζχ's are the simple supercuspidal representations of [formula].

To compute the Rankin-Selberg integrals, we need a Whittaker function for πζχ. We note that [formula] for [formula], so the function

[formula]

lives in IndGUψ, and is therefore a Whittaker function for πζχ with respect to ψ.

The computation of Φ(W,fs)

In this section, we compute one side of the functional equation [\eqref=functionalequation] that defines γ(s,π  ×  τ,ψ), where π is a simple supercuspidal representation of [formula], and τ is a tamely ramified character of GL1.

We first note that since τ is a character of GL1, Φ(W,fs) simplifies to

[formula]

Moreover, note that by [\eqref=SOevendefinition],

[formula]

We will pass between SO2 and GL1 when convenient.

We now define fs∈VSO2Q1(W(τ,ψ- 1),s) (see [\eqref=sectiondefinition]) by

[formula]

where τ(h) and [formula], mean τ and [formula], applied to the upper left entry of h. The map a  ↦  f(g,a) is easily seen to be in the Whittaker model W(τ,ψ- 1) of τ.

Recall the Whittaker function W that we defined earlier (see [\eqref=whittakerfunction]) for [formula].

If [formula], then [formula] and [formula].

Let h  =  diag(a,a- 1)∈SO2. Note that [formula] embeds in [formula] as

[formula]

By comparing lower left matrix entries, one can see that [formula]. Moreover, by comparing upper left matrix entries, one can see that if [formula], we must have that [formula]. This implies immediately, by comparing first columns, that every entry in the column vector y is contained in [formula].

Since τ is tamely ramified, we obtain

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=supportofW] and since USO2  =  1, we obtain

[formula]

[formula]

Since τ is tamely ramified, [formula]. Applying Lemma [\ref=supportofW] again, we have that

[formula]

[formula]

Since [formula], this last double integral equals [formula], as claimed.

The computation of Φ*(W,fs)

In this section, we compute Φ*(W,fs), for the same choice of W and fs as in §[\ref=easyside]. Since τ is a character of GL1, Φ*(W,fs) simplifies to

[formula]

We note in particular that

[formula]

In order that [formula], it must be that [formula], and that [formula].

We first note that if

[formula]

then

[formula]

Here (as in §[\ref=easyside]), [formula] is a column vector, and [formula] is a row vector.

We now perform some matrix computations. If [formula] and k  =  (k)ij∈I+, we get that

[formula]

In order that [formula], we must have that [formula], by definition of W.

We first consider the double coset [formula]. Let us compare the last row of [formula] to the last row of ugχk. In particular, since [formula], we must have that [formula]. Since [formula] for j  ≥  2, we moreover require that every entry of y' (hence y) is in [formula].

A similar type of computation shows that [formula].

We now have our main result.

[formula]

We first note that since τ is a character of GL1, we have that [formula].

Now let h  =  diag(a,a- 1)∈SO2, and suppose that [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=whittakersupport], we have that [formula] and [formula]. In particular, we can write a  =  ϖ- 1v, for some [formula].

We now decompose [formula] in the double coset [formula] as

[formula]

[formula]

This decomposition implies by Lemma [\ref=whittakersupport] that [formula]. Finally, one can see that M(τ,s)fs(h- 1,1)  =  fs(h- 1,1). Since the support of W forced [formula], we have that fs(h- 1,1)  =  1. Therefore,

[formula]

since τ is tamely ramified. Combining this computation with Corollary [\ref=easysidecomputation] and [\eqref=functionalequation], we have our result.

We now compare the γ(s,πζχ  ×  τ,ψ) with the gamma factors of simple supercuspidal representations of [formula].

The representations πζχ of [formula] and σζχ of [formula] (that has trivial central character) share the same twisted gamma factors, where the twisting is over all tamely ramified characters τ of GL1. That is,

[formula]

for all tamely ramified characters τ of GL1.

This is just a matching of the gamma factors from Theorem [\ref=gammafactor] and Lemma [\ref=simplesupercuspidalgammagln].

Depth-preservation

In this section, we briefly recall a conjecture about preservation of depth in the local Langlands correpsondence. We then show that if one assumes the conjecture, the representation IndWFWEξ of WF that we constructed in §[\ref=introduction] is in fact the Langlands parameter of πζχ.

We recall that the depth of a representation [formula] of the Weil-Deligne group is defined as [formula], where [formula], is the filtration of the inertia subgroup I of WF.

Suppose that [formula] is a tamely ramified p-adic group, and let [formula] be the Langlands parameter of a representation π of [formula]. It is conjectured that if p is sufficiently large, then depth(π)  =  depth(φ).

Assume that the depth perservation conjecture holds. Then, for p sufficiently large, the Langlands parameter of π  =  πζχ is IndWFWEξ.

Suppose, to the contrary, that the Langlands parameter [formula] is reducible. Write [formula], with [formula]. Since [formula], and since [formula] by assumption, we see immediately that m  =  1.

We therefore conclude, in particular, that the functorial lift of π to [formula] (under the embedding [formula]) is supercuspidal and has depth [formula], so in fact is simple supercuspidal. We also note that this lift must have trivial central character since it is a lift from [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=funclift] and by [\cite=AL14], this lift must be σζχ (with trivial central character). The main result of [\cite=AL14] says that the Langlands parameter of σζχ is IndWFWEξ.
