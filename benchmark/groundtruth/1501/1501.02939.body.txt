Squaring operator Pólya-Szegö and Diaz-Metcalf type inequalities

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the C*-algebra of all bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space [formula]. Throughout the paper, a capital letter means an operator in [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] can be identified with the space [formula] of all n  ×  n complex matrices. We identify a scalar with the identity operator I multiplied by this scalar. An operator A is called positive if [formula] for all [formula], and we then write [formula]. An operator A is said to be strictly positive (denoted by A > 0) if it is a positive invertible operator. For self-adjoint operators [formula], we say B  ≥  A if [formula]. For strictly positive operators, A2  ≤  k2B2 for some constant k if and only if (AB- 1)*(AB- 1)  ≤  k2 and this occurs if and only if [formula]. A linear map [formula] is called positive if A  ≥  0 implies Φ(A)  ≥  0. If this implication holds for >   instead of ≥  , we say that Φ is strictly positive. It is said to be unital if Φ preserves the identity operator. The operator norm is denoted by [formula]. For A,B > 0, the operator geometric mean [formula] is defined by [formula]. Using a standard limit argument, this notion can be extended for positive operators A,B. The geometric mean operation is monotone, in the sense that C1  ≤  D1 and C2  ≤  D2 imply that [formula].

Moslehian et al. [\cite=BZ02] gave operator Pólya-Szegö inequality (see also [\cite=LEE] for an interesting proof for matrices) and Diaz-Metcalf type inequality as follows:

Let Φ be a positive linear map. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and m2  ≤  M2,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let Φ be a positive linear map. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and 0 < m2  ≤  M2, then the following inequality holds:

[formula]

It is well known that ts    (0  ≤  s  ≤  1) is an operator monotone function and not so is t2; see [\cite=abc]. However, Fujii et al. [\cite=FUJ] use the Kantrovich inequality to show that t2 is order preserving in a certain sense as follows:

Let 0  <  m  ≤  A  ≤  M and A  ≤  B. Then

[formula]

Other similar results for the power p instead of 2 was given by Furuta in [\cite=FUR]. Lin [\cite=LIN1] nicely reduced the study of squared operator inequalities to that of some norm inequalities, see also [\cite=LIN2]. This paper intends to square the operator Pólya-Szegö inequality ([\ref=amm]) and the Diaz-Metcalf type inequality ([\ref=ak]) in different ways based on the above considerations.

Results

We start our work with the following known result.

[\cite=AND] Let Φ be any positive linear map and A,B  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

Our first main result reads as follows.

Let Φ be a unital positive linear map. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and m2  ≤  M2, then the following inequality holds:

[formula]

where

[formula]

and α is the number given in Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Put

[formula]

and

[formula]

It follows from the monotone property of the operator geometric mean and

[formula]

that

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=thm1] and inequality [\eqref=e3] yield that

[formula]

From [\eqref=(2)] we have (M  -  C)(C  -  m)  ≥  0 and (M  -  D)(D  -  m)  ≥  0. Hence

[formula]

Employing [\eqref=(3)] and [\eqref=(4)] we have

[formula]

Consider the real function f(t) on (0,  ∞  ) defined as

[formula]

Then we can conclude from [\eqref=(2)], [\eqref=(5)] and [\eqref=(6)] that

[formula]

Notice that

[formula]

and

[formula]

The function f(t) has only one stationary (= maximum) point at

[formula]

with the maximum value (by [\eqref=(1)])

[formula]

Therefore we can conclude that

[formula]

It is immediate to see from [\eqref=(1)] and [\eqref=(9)] that m  ≤  t0 is equivalent to [formula] Finally we have again by [\eqref=(1)]

[formula]

This completes the proof of Theorem

The axiomatic theory for operator means of positive invertible operators have been developed by Kubo and Ando [\cite=ando]. There exists an affine order isomorphism between the class of operator means σ and the class of positive operator monotone functions f defined on (0,  ∞  ) via f(t)I = Iσ(tI)    (t > 0) and [formula]. The function [formula] on (0,  ∞  ) for μ∈(0,1) gives the operator weighted geometric mean [formula]. The case μ = 1 / 2 gives rise to the geometric mean [formula]. It should be noted that

[formula]

is known as an Ando type inequality in the literature, see [\cite=AND]. We need the next result appeared in [\cite=abc] in some general forms.

Let Φ be a unital positive linear map and σ be an operator mean with the representing function f. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and m2  ≤  M2, then

[formula]

with

[formula]

where

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

see [\cite=SEO1]. In particular, for [formula] we get the operator Pólya-Szegö inequality. It is easy to see that, by utilizing the same argument as in Theorem [\ref=thm3], the following general but complicated form of Theorem [\ref=thm3] holds:

Under the same conditions as in Theorem [\ref=thm3]

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us return to the case of usual operator geometric mean [formula]. An immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm3] reads as follows. It can be also deduced from Theorems [\ref=thm1] and [\ref=fuj].

Under the same conditions as in Theorem [\ref=thm3],

[formula]

It is easy to see that the coefficient α2 from ([\ref=amm]) is smaller than β in [\eqref=af], but we obtained the relation between [formula] and [formula].

The following consequence may be regarded as a Grüss type inequality, see [\cite=MOS] and references therein.

Let Φ be a unital positive linear map. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and m2  ≤  M2, then the following inequality holds:

[formula]

where β is defined by [\eqref=beta].

It follows from [\eqref=af] that

[formula]

It follows from [\eqref=order] that

[formula]

Employing [\eqref=001] and [\eqref=002] we infer [\eqref=gruss].

To achieve our next result we need some auxiliary lemmas. The first Lemma is a consequence of the Jensen inequality and the operator convexity of f(t) = 1 / t.

[\cite=CHO] Let Φ be a unital strictly positive linear map and A > 0. Then

[formula]

The next lemma is proved for matrices but a careful investigation shows that it is true for operators on an arbitrary Hilbert space.

[\cite=BZ03] Let A,B  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=lem2] is due to Bhatia and Kittaneh in [\cite=BZ03]. They proved the result for the finite dimensional case. However, for infinite dimensional case, the result for operator norm is also true . Also, we notice that if A,B are compact operators, then a stronger result can be found in [\cite=BZ05].

The following lemma includes the well-known operator geometric-arithmetic mean inequality.

[\cite=abc] Let A,B  ≥  0. Then

[formula]

The definition of operator geometric mean easily yields the next lemma.

Let A,B > 0. Then

[formula]

We now present our next main result.

Let Φ be a unital positive linear map. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and m2  ≤  M2, then the following inequality holds:

[formula]

It is easy to see that ([\ref=aa]) is equivalent to

[formula]

Evidently

[formula]

and hence

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

In the same way, we have

[formula]

Inequalities [\eqref=ff] and [\eqref=gg] yield that

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

Now we have

[formula]

which is equivalent to

[formula]

It is easy to obtain that

[formula]

in ([\ref=ak]) is smaller than

[formula]

in ([\ref=aa]), but we obtain the relation between [formula] and [formula].

Let Φ be a unital positive linear map. If 0 < m21  ≤  A  ≤  M21 and 0 < m22  ≤  B  ≤  M22 for some positive real numbers m1  ≤  M1 and m2  ≤  M2, then the following inequality hold:

[formula]

and
