PSR B0329+54: Scattering Structures on Two Scales Observed with RadioAstron on Baselines of up to 235,000 km

Introduction

All radio signals from cosmic sources are distorted by the plasma turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM). Understanding of this turbulence is therefore essential for the proper interpretation of astronomical radio observations. The properties and characteristics of this turbulence can best be studied by observing point-like radio sources, where the results are not influenced by the extended structure of the source, but instead are directly attributable to the effect of the ISM itself. Pulsars are such sources. Dispersion and scattering affect radio emission from pulsars. Whereas dispersion in the plasma column introduces delays in arrival time that depend upon frequency and results in smearing of the pulse, scattering by density inhomogeneities causes angular broadening, pulse broadening, intensity modulation or scintillation, and distortion of radio spectra in the form of diffraction patterns. The scattering effects have already been studied extensively theoretically [\citep=prokhorov1975] [\citep=rickett1977] [\citep=goodman1989] [\citep=narayan1989] [\citep=shishov2003] and observationally with ground VLBI of Sgr A* [\citep=gwinn2014] and pulsars [\citep=bartel1985] [\citep=desai1992] [\citep=kondratiev2007], and with ground-space VLBI of PSR B0329+54  [\citep=yangalov2001]. Whereas the latter observations were done at a relatively high frequency of 1.7 GHz and with baselines of ≈  25,000 km and less, ground-space VLBI with RadioAstron  allowed observations at one-fifth the frequency where propagation effects are expected to be much stronger, and with baselines ~  10 times longer [\citep=kardashev2013]. Such observations can resolve the scatter-broadened image of a pulsar and reveal new information about the scattering medium [\citep=smirnova2014]. In this paper, we study the scattered image of the pulsar B0329+54 with RadioAstron.

Theoretical Background

Our fundamental observable is the interferometric visibility V. In the domain of frequency ν, this is the product of electric fields at two antennas A and B:

[formula]

This representation of the visibility is known as the cross spectrum, or cross-power spectrum. Because electric fields at the antennas are complex, and different, it is complex. Usually the visibility is averaged over multiple accumulations of the spectrum, to reduce noise from the noiselike electric field of the source. The second argument t allows for the possibility that the visibility changes in time, as it does for a scintillating source, over times longer than the time to accumulate a single spectrum. Such a spectrum that changes in time is known as a "dynamic spectrum" [\citep=bracewell2000]. The correlator used to analyze our data, as discussed in Sections [\ref=sec:obs] and [\ref=sec:red], calculates ṽAB(ν,t) [\citep=RACorrelator]. Hereafter, we omit the baseline subscript indicating baseline AB in this paper, except in sections of the Appendix where the baseline is important.

We derive a number of representations of the visibility and quantities derived from it, and show that these provide straightforward means to extract the impulse-response function. These functions are summarized in Figure [\ref=fig:FTCircle], and discussed briefly here, and in detail in Section [\ref=sec:impulse-response_visibility] of the Appendix. In particular, visibility in the domain of delay τ and time t is V(τ,t). This is the correlation function of electric field at the two antennas A and B (Equation [\ref=eq:Vtau_def]), and is the Fourier transform of ṽ(ν,t) from ν to τ. We further calculate C(τ,t), the square modulus of V(τ,t).

Under the assumptions that the source is pointlike, and that we can ignore background and source noise, the impulse-response function of interstellar scattering of electric field g determines the visibility of the source. We denote the typical dimension of g as τsc, the broadening time for a sharp pulse. Within this time span, g has a complicated amplitude and phase. The function g changes with time, as the line of sight shifts with motions of source, observer, and medium. This change takes place on a timescale tsc, and a spatial scale Ssc. If the scattering material remains nearly at rest while the line of sight travels through it at velocity [formula], then one spatial dimension in the observer plane maps into time, and

[formula]

The averaged square modulus of g is the pulse-broadening function G. This function is the average observed intensity for a single sharp pulse emitted at the source. An average over time is usually assumed to approximate the desired average over an ensemble of statistically-identical of realizations of scattering.

In this paper, we are primarily concerned with V(τ,t), the visibility in the domain of delay τ and time t. This is the cross correlation function of electric field at the two antennas A and B (Equation [\ref=eq:Vtau_def]), and also the Fourier transform of ṽ(ν,t) from ν to τ. We are also concerned with the square modulus of V(τ,t) (see Section [\ref=sec:acf_visibility]):

[formula]

We calculate C for right- and left-circular polarizations separately, and then correlate them in delay τ to form KRL:

[formula]

Here, the subscripted angular brackets 〈...〉τ denote an average over the delay τ, thus forming the cross-correlation between polarizations.

When averaged over many realizations of the scattering material KRL is related to the statistics of the pulse-broadening function G. For a baseline that extends much further than the scale of scattering Ssc, (see Equation [\ref=eq:K_result]):

[formula]

Here, the subscripted angular brackets 〈...〉S denote the average over many realizations of the scattering. This average is most often approximated by averaging over a time much longer than tsc; for this reason we omit the time argument for KRL(Δτ). Equivalently, evaluation of KRL(Δτ,f)  =  〈CR(τ,f)CL(τ  +  Δτ,f)〉τ at the fringe rate fmax of the maximum magnitude of KRL yields the same time average. For this theoretical discussion, fmax = 0; for practical observations, instrumental factors can offset the fringe rate from zero, so that fmax provides the most reliable time average.

Our analysis method differs somewhat from [\citet=smirnova2014], who used structure functions of intensity, visibility, and visibility squared to study scattering of pulsar B0950+08 on an extremely long baseline to RadioAstron. The two methods are closely related theoretically. Structure functions are particularly valuable when the characteristic bandwidth approaches the instrumental bandwidth, and can be extended to cases where signal-to-noise ratio is low, as they discuss.

Observations

The observations were made in two sessions: the first for one hour each on the four successive days November 26 to 29, 2012, and the second for a total of 12 hours on the two days January 1 and 2, 2014. The first session used the 10-m RadioAstron  Space Radio Telescope (SRT) together with the 110-m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The second session used the SRT together with the [formula]-m Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), and the 64-m Kalyazin Radio Telescopes (KL). Both right (RCP) and left circular polarizations (LCP) were recorded in November 2012, and only one polarization channel (RCP) was recorded in January 2014. Because of an SRT peculiarity at 324 MHz, the 316-332 MHz observing band was recorded as a single upper sideband, with one-bit digitization at the SRT and with two-bit digitization at the GBT, WSRT, and KL. Science data from the SRT were transmitted in real time to the telemetry station in Pushchino [\citep=kardashev2013] and then recorded with the RadioAstron  data recorder (RDR). This type of recorder was also used at the KL, while the Mk5B recording system was used at the GBT and WSRT. Table [\ref=tab:diary] summarizes the observations.

The data were transferred via internet to the Astro Space Center (ASC) in Moscow and then processed with the ASC correlator with gating and dedispersion applied [\citep=RACorrelator]. To determine the phase of the gate in the pulsar period, the average pulse profile was computed for every station by integrating the autocorrelation spectra (auto-spectra) obtained from the ASC correlator.

In November 2012 the projected baselines to the space radio telescope were about 60, 90, 175, and 235 thousand kilometers for the four consecutive days, respectively. Data were recorded in 570-second scans, with 30-second gaps between scans. In January 2014 the projected baselines were about 20, 70, and 90 thousand kilometers during the 12-hour session. Data were recorded in 1170-second scans. The SRT operated only during three sets of scans of 60, 100 and 120 min each, with large gaps in between caused by thermal constraints on the spacecraft. The auto-level (AGC), phase cal, and noise diode were turned off during our observations to avoid interference with pulses from the pulsar. Table [\ref=tab:baselines] gives parameters of the Earth-space baselines observed.

Data Reduction

Correlation

All of the recorded data were correlated with the ASC correlator using 4096 channels for the November 2012 session and 2048 channels for the January 2014 session, with gating and dedispersion activated. The ON-pulse window was centered on the main component of the average profile, with a width of 5 ms in the November 2012 session and 8 ms in the January 2014 session. These compare with a 7-ms pulse width at 50% of the peak flux density [\citep=Lorimer1995]. The OFF-pulse window was offset from the main pulse by half a period and had the same width as the ON-pulse window. The correlator output was always sampled synchronously with the pulsar period of 0.714 s (single pulse mode). We used ephemerides computed with the program TEMPO for the Earth center [\citep=TEMPO]. The results of the correlation were tabulated as cross power spectra (cross-spectra), ṽ(ν,t), written in standard FITS format.

Single-Dish Data Reduction

Using autocorrelation spectra at GBT, KL, and WB, we measured the scintillation time and bandwidth. The results are given in Table [\ref=tab:scatt_params]. We found two different scales of scattering, as we did for the more extensive analysis discussed below; because the larger-delay scale is quite weak, the analysis using interferometric data, for which the noise baseline is absent and the spectral resolution was higher, is more accurate.

VLBI Data Reduction

The ASC correlator calculates the cross-power spectrum, ṽ(ν,t), as discussed in Sections [\ref=sec:Theory_Intro] and [\ref=sec:visibility]. The resolution of the resulting cross-power spectra is 3.906 kHz for the 2012 observations and 7.812 kHz for the 2014 observations. Because the scintillation bandwidth was comparable to the channel bandwidth for the 2014 observations, as shown in Table [\ref=tab:scatt_params], and because the single recorded polarization in them prevented us from correlating polarizations, as discussed in Section [\ref=sec:two_scales], we focus our analysis and interpretation on the 2012 observations.

Analysis of Interferometric Visibility

We studied the statistics of visibility V(τ,f) as a function of delay, fringe rate, and baseline length. If there were no scattering material between the pulsar and the observer, we would expect for |V(τ,f)| one spike at zero delay and fringe rate with magnitude that is constant as a function of baseline length, and with width equal to the inverse of the observed bandwidth in delay, and the inverse of the scan length in fringe rate. Scattering material in between changes this picture. First we expect the spike at zero delay and fringe rate to decrease in magnitude with increasing baseline length, perhaps to a point where it would not be visible anymore. Second, we expect spikes to appear around the spike at zero delay and fringe rate. The distribution of these spikes give us invaluable information about the statistics of the scattering material.

As we discuss in this section, we fitted models to the distribution of the magnitudes of the visibility, |V(τ,f)|, and thus derived scintillation parameters that describe the impulse-response function for propagation along the line of sight from the pulsar. We also computed the maximum visibility as a function of projected baseline length, as we discuss in detail in a separate paper.

For strong single pulses the visibility in the cross spectra, ṽ(ν,t), had signal-to-noise ratios sufficiently large for a useful analysis. However, we decided to analyze the data from the time series of multiple pulses. Fourier transform of the cross spectrum, ṽ(ν,t), to the delay/fringe-rate domain yields V(ν,f) and concentrates the signal into a central region, and thus provides a high signal-to-noise ratio. The sampling rate of individual cross spectra in the time series was the pulse period of 0.714 s, as noted above. The time span of cross spectra used to form V(τ,f) varied, ranging from 71.4 s to 570 s, depending upon the application.

Distribution of visibility

In Figure [\ref=fig:frrt_delay] we display the magnitude of the visibility in the delay/fringe-rate domain, |V(τ,f)|, for a 500-s time span. The data were obtained on 29 November 2012 in the RCP channel for a projected 200Mλ GBT-SRT baseline. The cross spectra, ṽ(ν,t), from which we obtained |V(τ,f)| were sampled with 4096 spectral channels across the 16-MHz band, at the pulsar period of 0.714 s; consequently, the resolution was 0.03125 μs in delay, and 2 mHz in fringe rate. As Figure [\ref=fig:frrt_delay] shows, there is no dominant central spike at zero delay and fringe rate visible as would be expected for an unresolved source. Our long baseline interferometer completely resolves the scattering disk. Instead we see a distribution of spikes around zero delay and fringe rate that is concentrated in a relatively limited region of the delay-fringe rate domain. The locations of the various spikes appear to be random. Because the scattering disk is completely resolved by our long baseline, we conclude that the spikes are a consequence of random reinforcement or cancellation of paths to the different locations of the two telescopes, and hence interferometer phase.

In the figure, the distribution of the magnitude of visibility is relatively broad along the delay axis and relatively narrow along the fringe rate axis. The extent is limited in delay to about the inverse of the scintillation bandwidth, τsc = 1 / 2πΔνsc; and in fringe rate to about the inverse of the diffractive timescale [formula]. Within this region, the visibility shows many narrow, discrete spikes. If statistics of the random phase and amplitude of scintillation are Gaussian, and the phases of the Fourier transform randomize the different sums that comprise the visibility in the delay-fringe rate domain, then the square modulus of V(τ,f) should be drawn from an exponential distribution, multiplied by the envelope defined by the deterministic part of the impulse-response function, as discussed in the Appendix.

The distribution of the magnitude of the visibility in delay/fringe-rate domain changes with baseline length. Figure [\ref=fig:delay_fine_structure] displays cross-sections through the maximum of the distribution of magnitude for a range of baseline lengths, as a function of delay. The maxima lie near zero fringe rate, as expected. Under the plausible and usual assumption that the correct fringe rate lies at the fringe rate, f max, where the distribution peaks, the cross-section represents the visibility averaged over the time span of the sample:

[formula]

The top panel of Figure [\ref=fig:delay_fine_structure] shows this cross-section through Figure [\ref=fig:frrt_delay]. The next lower panel shows the cross-section for the slightly shorter SRT-KL baseline. The three lower plots give the equivalent cross-sections for 10 times and 100 times shorter projected baselines. These three short-baseline cross-sections are qualitatively different from the long baseline cross sections: the visibility has a central spike resulting from the component of the cross-spectrum that has a constant phase over time, as well as the broad distribution from the component that has a varying phase over time. The central spike is strongest for the shortest baseline and weaker for the next longer baselines, as expected based on the results of Sections [\ref=sec:visibility] and [\ref=sec:acf_visibility]. At very long baselines the central spike is absent even after averaging the visibility over the whole observing period, and only the broad component is present. As expected from Figure [\ref=fig:frrt_delay], in the delay/time domain the broad component appears as spikes distributed over a range of about 10 ~ μs in delay. These spikes keep their position in delay for the scintillation time of about 100 to 115 s, as listed in Table [\ref=tab:scatt_params].

Observed Correlation Functions

We investigated the scattering of the pulsar from the visibility in the delay-fringe-rate domain, V(τ,f). Along the delay axis, |V(τ,f)| takes the general form suggested by Figures [\ref=fig:frrt_delay] and [\ref=fig:delay_fine_structure]: a narrow spike surrounded by a broad distribution. We found that the central spike takes the form of a sinc function in both delay and fringe rate coordinates, as expected for uniform visibility across a square passband [\citep=TMS2007]. The widths are somewhat larger than values expected from observing bandwidth of 16 MHz and time span of 71.4 s, of wnτ = 31.25 ns and wnf = 14 mHz respectively, probably because of the non-uniformity of receiver bandpasses and pulse-to-pulse intensity variations, respectively. The broader part of the distribution takes an exponential form along the fringe-rate axis. Traveling ionospheric disturbances may affect the time behavior of our 92-cm observations, particularly over times longer than 600 s. We do not analyze the broader distribution in fringe rate further in this paper; we will discuss this distribution, and the influence of traveling ionospheric disturbances, in a separate publication. Because of the relatively small optical path length of the ionosphere, even at λ = 92 cm, they cannot affect the cross spectrum [\citep=Hagfors1976].

Figure [\ref=fig:Cross-section_FR-DL] shows an example of the broad component of |V(τ,f)| along the delay coordinate, after selecting the peak fringe rate fmax and averaging over 16 lags of delay. Selection of the fringe-rate peak is equivalent to an average over the span of the observation, after correlation for an instrumental fringe rate. The broad distribution samples the properties of the fine structure seen in Figures [\ref=fig:frrt_delay] and [\ref=fig:delay_fine_structure]; averaging in delay reduces the fine structure. Along the delay axis, the distribution followed an approximately exponential distribution in |τ|, with best-fitting scale τsc = 7.3μs. The fit also included parameters for an offset, as for a background noise level [\citep=0834noise2011] [\citep=velanoise2012].

Correlation Function: Two Exponential Scales

To obtain information about the broad component of correlation function we computed KRL(Δτ), the averaged cross-correlation function between the square modulus of right-circular polarized (RCP) and of left-circular polarized (LCP) of visibility in the delay domain (see Equation [\ref=eq:KRLdef]). The squared modulus of visibility was calculated as the squared sum of components (real and imaginary) of V(τ,t), the inverse Fourier transform of the cross-power spectrum. We formed these for each strong pulse. We then averaged KRL over 570-sec scans to form 〈KRL(Δτ)〉t. Averaging in the time domain approximated an average over realizations of the impulse-response function for the scattering medium. Each such scan included 100 to 250 strong pulses. The correlation 〈KRL(Δτ)〉t has no contribution of noise to the spike at the origin. That spike must arise from the scattered pulsar signal. Thus, we obtained an averaged sample of 〈KRL(Δτ)〉t for every 570-sec scan. We obtained 22 measurements in total, with 6 samples of 〈KRL(Δτ)〉t for November 26 , 28, 29 observing sessions. We obtained only 4 such samples for November 27 because of no significant detections of V for two scans on that date.

Careful examination of the cross correlation function, KRL(Δτ), revealed two exponential scales for the broad component, a large one and a small one. Figure [\ref=fig:TwoScaleExamples] shows an example. We see these two scales even for single pulses, which are strong enough to show the two-scale structure. We did not observe these scales without doubt in spectra from single-dish observations since they are more subject to noise, gain fluctuations, and interference.

We formalized these results with a model fit. The model assumed a pulse-broadening function with two exponential scales. A single emitted pulse appears at the observer with average shape:

[formula]

The pulse rises very rapidly, and falls as the sum of the two exponentials. The scales and the magnitudes of their contributions varied from scan to scan, but in a manner that was consistent with our finite sample of the scintillation pattern, and the inhomogeneous averaging of pulses with different intensities. We show a histogram of the results of our fits to 570-sec intervals in Figure [\ref=fig:ScaleDistributions]. On 26 to 29 November 2012, the shorter scale was [formula], and the longer scale was τ2  =  22.5  ±  2.9 μs. The scales had relative power of about A2 / A1  =  0.38.

Discussion

On a long baseline that we believe fully resolves the scattering disk, we observe multiple sharp spikes in the visibility V(τ,f) is a consequence of the variation of the amplitude and phase of visibility. The characteristic region of that variation, Δτ  ×  Δf, reflects the inverses of the scintillation bandwidth Δτ  ≈  1 / 2πΔνsc and the scintillation timescale Δf  ≈  1 / 2πtsc. These quantities reflect the time span of the impulse-response function, and the time for the impulse-response function to change as the line of sight to the observer moves through the scattering material.

Detailed examination of the correlation function of visibility KRL(Δτ,t) reveals the presence of two characteristic, exponential scales. Both scales are visible in single-pulse correlation functions of right and left circular polarization, as well as in the correlation function 〈KRL(Δτ)〉t averaged over 570 s shown in Figure [\ref=fig:TwoScaleExamples]. For an assumed screen distance of half the pulsar distance of D = 1.03+ 0.13- 0.12 kpc [\citep=brisken2002], the two scales correspond to lateral scales of

[formula]

In contrast, [\citet=britton1998] measured angular broadening for PSR B0329+54  of θH  <  3.4 mas at ν = 325 MHz, where θH is the full width of the scattered image at half the maxium intensity. The corresponds to a lateral scale of [formula]. This is marginally consistent with scales inferred from the present observations, if one takes into account the facts that the larger scale contains 0.38 of the power of the shorter one, and that the scattering material may be somewhat closer to the pulsar. Investigation of the actual scattered image in a forthcoming paper will help to clarify these issues.

Previous Observations

[\citet=shishov2003] studied the scattering properties of PSR B0329+54  in detail, using single-antenna observations at 102 MHz, 610 MHz, 5 GHz, and 10.6 GHz to form structure functions of the scintillation in time and frequency on a wide range of scales. They concluded that the scattering material has a power-law spatial spectrum with index α + 2 = 3.50  ±  0.05, marginally consistent with the value of 11 / 3 expected for a Kolmogorov spectrum, with an outer scale of 2  ×  1011 m  <  L0  <  1017 m. Using VLBI, [\citet=bartel1985] observed PSR B0329+54  at 2.3 GHz and set limits on any shift of the centroid of the emission over the course of a pulse. [\citet=yangalov2001] observed PSR B0329+54  at 1.650 GHz with Earth-space baselines to HALCA, and found that the source varied strongly with time. They ascribed this variation to scintillation, with the scintillation bandwidth comparable to the observing bandwidth at their observing frequency. Self-calibration with timespans less than the scintillation time returned a pointlike image, as expected. [\citep=semenkov2004] analyzed these data, including Earth-Earth baselines. They studied both single-antenna autocorrelation functions VAA(Δτ) and cross-correlation functions V(Δτ). They detected two timescales for the scintillation pattern, of 20 min and 1 min. They found that the properties of scattering could not be explained by a single, thin screen, and further that velocities indicated relative motions within the scattering medium.

[\citet=popov1984] had previously observed two coexisting scales of scattering for PSR B0329+54 . They found scintillation bandwidths of Δν1  =  115 Hz and Δν2  =  750 Hz, measured as the 1 / e point of the correlation function of intensity at an observing frequency of 102 MHz, using the Large Cophase Array of Puschino Observatory. The ratio of these scales, Δν2  /  Δν1 = 6.5 is larger than the ratio of 5.5 that we observe. Scaled to our observing frequency of 324 MHz, using the [formula] scaling appropriate for a Kolmogorov spectrum, and converting from Δν to τ using the uncertainty relation τ  =  1 / 2πΔν, we find that these values correspond to 1.3 and 8 μs, respectively, about a factor of 3 smaller that the scales we observe. Of course, interpolation over a factor of 3 in observing frequency and the different observing techniques may introduce biases, and scattering parameters likely vary over the years between the two measurements. Two scales of scattering have also been observed for other pulsars [\citep=gwinn2006] [\citep=smirnova2014].

Origin of Two Scales

Two scales of scattering may be a consequence of a variety of factors. Non-Gaussian statistics of scattering can produce multiple scales, although this usually appears as a continuum of scales rather than two different individual scales, as in a power-law distribution or a Levy flight [\citep=boldyrev2003]. A model with two discrete scales appears to fit our data better.

One explanation is anisotropic scattering. This can produce two scales, corresponding to the major and minor axes of the scattering disk, as discussed in Section [\ref=sec:anisotropic] of the Appendix. The ratio of the scales of k2 / k1  =  5.46 corresponds to the parameter α2 = 56.5, and an axial ratio of [formula]. In a simple model for anisotropic scattering in a thin screen, we expect the ratio of power in the scales to be approximately [formula], as shown in Section [\ref=sec:anisotropic] of the Appendix. This compares well with our observed ratio of A1 / A2 = 0.38.

A second explanation is the complicated structure observed within dynamic spectra: most commonly observed as "scintillation arcs" [\citep=stinebring2001]. Recently, it has been suggested that this structure arises from interference among subimages, resulting from refraction by interstellar reconnection sheets [\citep=PenLevin2014]. This complicated structure produces time and frequency variations on a wide range of scales. Of course, we are considering very long baselines, where the scintillation-arc patterns should be completely uncorrelated between antennas. This may lead to blurring, resulting in a 2-scale correlation function without particularly strong structure corresponding to the discrete arcs seen on shorter baselines [\citep=brisken2010]. We do not see any direct evidence of parabolic arcs, as such. The magnitude of the visibility shows a featureless decline with increase of either of the 2 dimensions |τ| and |f|. The GBT autocorrelation functions do not show parabolic arcs either, for our observations.

Summary

We made VLBI observations of PSR B0329+54  with RadioAstron  at 324 MHz on projected baselines of up to 235,000 km. Our goal was to investigate scattering properties of the ISM. These properties affect radio observations of all celestial sources. While the results of such observations are in general influenced by the convolution of source structure with the scattering processes, pulsars are virtually point-like sources and signatures in the observational results can be directly related to the ISM scattering properties.

On long baselines, in the domain of delay τ and fringe-rate f, the correlation function of visibility V(τ,f) is a collection of narrow spikes, located within a region defined by the inverses of the scintillation bandwidth Δτ  ≈  1 / 2πΔνsc and the scintillation timescale Δf  ≈  1 / 2πtsc. For shorter baselines, a sharp spike at the center of this region represents the average visibility; on long baselines where the average visibility drops to near zero, this spike is absent.

The autocorrelation function of the visibility, |V(τ,f)|, corresponds to a simple smooth model, indicating that the visibility spikes are the result of random interference of many scattered rays. The correlation function KRL of the square modulus of left- and right-polarized visibility |V(τ,fmax)|2, at the fringe rate of the peak f max, shows two exponentials with different characteristic timescales. This is equivalent to the time average of KRL. On 2012 Nov 26 to 29, the shorter timescale was 4.1  ±  0.3 μs, and the longer timescale was 22.5  ±  2.9 μs, with the longer-scale exponential containing approximately 0.38 times the power of the shorter-scale exponential. This double exponential may arise from anisotropic scattering; or from scattered radiation at large angle, perhaps corresponding to the subimages seen in single-dish and shorter-baseline observations. Further investigation of the properties of the image of the scattered pulsar on long and short baselines, using these data, will help to clarify the origin of the two scales.

Impulse-Response Function and Visibility

Impulse-Response Function

Under general assumptions about scattering and source emission, the observed electric field of a pulsar Eobs(to) is the convolution of the electric field emitted at the source with a kernel g that depends on scattering:

[formula]

where we introduce the symbol [formula] for convolution. The kernel g is the impulse-response function; in other words, if the pulsar emits a sharp spike, then the observed electric field of the pulse is simply a copy of g. Because of this convolution, g is also known as the propagation kernel; it is also known as the Green's function and the S matrix [\citep=GwinnJohnson2011]. Both Esrc and g vary at the Nyquist rate: the inverse of the total observed bandwidth. Usually, we assume that the intrinsic electric field of the source is white noise at the Nyquist rate: it is drawn from a Gaussian distribution in the complex plane at each instant [\citep=rickett1975]. The impulse-response function extends over a time span τsc, representing the time over which a sharp pulse at the source would be received.

If the statistics of the scattering material are stationary, the characteristic shape and scales of g will remain fixed, while details of amplitude and phase vary on the timescale tsc (Equation [\ref=eq:t_sc]). An average of the squared electric field over many pulses will reveal that characteristic form. A model form for g that includes deterministic and random parts is the product of a non-varying envelope, and a random function that of te that changes over time tsc:

[formula]

The intensity received by the observer for an electric-field impulse at the source, averaged over many such impulses with different realizations of the scattering material, is the square modulus of the deterministic part of g, which we call G:

[formula]

Here, the subscripted angular brackets 〈...〉S indicate a statistical average over realizations of the scattering medium, for example as approximated by an average over pulses spanning a time greater than tsc. Often, G is called the pulse-broadening function. For convenience, we normalize G to unit area:

[formula]

For strong scattering, as is observed for most pulsars at most wavelengths, we expect that many different paths, with random amplitude and phase, will contribute to the received pulse at each instant te. Therefore, we expect that the random part gR will have the statistics of a random walk at each instant: the observed electric field will be drawn from a circularly Gaussian distribution in the complex plane, with zero mean. On the other hand, the deterministic part gD sets the standard deviation of g; it reflects how many paths, and with what strength, contribute at each delay. This model for scintillation is closely related to the amplitude-modulated-noise (AMN) model for pulsar emission [\citep=rickett1975]. In this model, the electric field emitted by the pulsar is the product of noise, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution in the complex plane, with a more-slowly varying envelope that determines the standard deviation of the noise at each instant.

We suppose that the random part is completely uncorrelated in time, over times Δte. Then, at a location "A,"

[formula]

The question of how the variation of gR with time depends upon baseline length is much more complicated, and we discuss it briefly below. However, if the lateral separation two stations A and B is much greater than the scale of the scattering pattern, then the random parts of g for the two stations, gRA and gRB, are completely uncorrelated.

Visibility: Dynamic Cross-Power Spectrum

As the previous discussion shows, the impulse-response function involves three timescales: gR changes at the Nyquist rate; gD varies over the typical span of the impulse-response function τsc; and the time for the random variations of gR to change is tsc. The dynamic cross-power spectrum provides a useful description for these different variations [\citep=bracewell2000]. A single sample of the cross-power spectrum, when averaged over time less than tsc, has the characteristic scale Δνsc  ≈  1 / 2πτsc, resulting from the finite span of the impulse-response function and the uncertainty principle. The time variation of the cross-power spectrum over times t  ≥  tsc captures the changes of gR.

Visibility ṽ in the domain of frequency ν and time t is the product of the Fourier transforms of electric fields at stations A and B:

[formula]

We suppose that each sample of the cross-spectrum is averaged over many realizations of the source electric field Esrc, but over time short compared with tsc. This reduces noise from the source and backgrounds.

One may represent the visibility in four domains, as Figure [\ref=fig:FTCircle] illustrates. In this paper we are particularly concerned with VAB(τ,t), visibility in the domain of delay τ and time t. This is the Fourier transform of ṽAB(ν,t). The convolution theorem for Fourier transforms shows that V(τ,t) is the cross-correlation function of electric fields in the time domain:

[formula]

Here, te indexes individual samples of electric field, within a short interval near the time of measurement of the cross-power spectrum, t.

Notation

As conventions, we accent symbols with tilde " " to denote quantities that depend on observing frequency ν, and the same symbols without accent for the Fourier-conjugate domain of delay τ or time te. We assume that the variables (describing time and frequency) te,ν,τ,t,f, are discrete. They range from - N / 2 to N / 2 - 1, where N is the number of samples in the time or frequency span. We usually omit the subscripts indicating baseline AB on V, unless they are important for the immediate argument.

We denote the Fourier transform by [formula], and its inverse by [formula]. Our convention for normalization of the Fourier transform is that a function h normalized to unit area in the delay domain has value unity at zero frequency: h̃(ν = 0) = 1. Consequently, if h̃(ν) is normalized to unit area in the frequency domain, h(τ = 0) = 1 / N. This is the "{1, - 1}" convention of Wolfram Mathematica [\citep=FTConvention].

Visibility and Impulse-Response Function

From Equation [\ref=eq:tildeV_def] and the Fourier transform of Equation [\ref=eq:g_conv], the relation of the visibility and the impulse-response function is:

[formula]

Averaging the visibility over many scintillations yields the average visibility, ρ:

[formula]

Visibility depends on the separation [formula] of stations A and B, as well as on time and frequency. Equations [\ref=eq:normalize_gRA] and [\ref=eq:normalize_gD] show that ρAB = 1 for gRA = gRB = 0, and ρ  →  0 for uncorrelated gRA and gRB.

On intermediate baselines, the time structure of the correlation of g is more complicated, in a way that depends on the geometrical distribution of the paths that contribute to g, as seen at the observer plane. The shortest-length paths lie at small angles, and the longest at larger angles; so correlation between antennas should decrease at later time lags Δte within g. Moreover, in the frequency domain, dynamic single-dish spectra can show slants and complicated patterns [\citep=hewish1980] [\citep=stinebring2001], suggesting complicated correlations in the observer plane, under the assumption that time maps into space as noted above. Analysis of the visibility is thus easiest on very short baselines and very long ones.

Autocorrelation of Visibility

Visibility in the delay-rate domain, Fourier conjugate to the frequency-time domain, takes the form:

[formula]

Searches for interference fringes are often conducted in this domain: because absolute calibration of delay and fringe rate are usually impossible for very-long baseline interferometry, the peak of |V(τ,f)| can be used to determine them [\citep=TMS2007].

The secondary spectrum C(τ,f) may be defined as the square modulus of V(τ,f) :

[formula]

This function provides information similar to |V(τ,f)|, shown in Figure [\ref=fig:frrt_delay], but is easier to deal with statistically. Our long baselines fully resolve the scattered image. The phases of scintillation elements in ṽ(ν,t) appear to be random, and the phases of C(τ,f) show no discernible patterns. An inverse Fourier transform from fringe rate f to time t leads to C(τ,t):

[formula]

Evaluated at the fringe rate fmax of its peak magnitude, the secondary spectrum C(τ,fmax) approximates an average over realizations of the scintillation pattern of C(τ,t):

[formula]

On a baseline long enough that the scintillation pattern is completely uncorrelated between stations, this average is the autocorrelation of the pulse-broadening function G [\citep=GwinnJohnson2011]:

[formula]

We can extract the properties of the deterministic part of g from K, the autocorrelation function of C. On a baseline long enough that the scintillation pattern is completely uncorrelated between stations:

[formula]

On a long baseline, so that

[formula]

Here, [formula]. Conveniently, 〈K(0)〉S  =  2C(0)2, so this delta-function simply doubles the value of the smooth part of K at Δτ = 0. We expect that G will be real and non-negative, so that K will be as well. Conveniently, the correlation KRL(Δτ,t) between the secondary spectra C in the two circular polarizations eliminates some effects of noise, as noted in Section [\ref=sec:two_scales].

Two Exponentials

We consider a situation where the impulse-response function is the sum of two exponentials with different time constants k1 and k2, with a rapid rise from G = 0 at t = 0. As we discuss below, this may result in a variety of circumstances. We parametrize the impulse-response function:

[formula]

In the text, we also make use of the inverse scales τ1 = 1 / k1 and τ2 = 1 / k2; these can provide better physical insight. The autocorrelation of G provides the form for 〈C(τ)〉S, the mean square visibility in the delay-time domain, as given by Equation [\ref=eq:C_result]. For this impulse-response function, this takes the form:

[formula]

The autocorrelation function of C for this impulse-response function then takes the form:

[formula]

where:

[formula]

Thus, the two exponential scales 1 / k1,1 / k2 appear again, in K, as do the weights A1, A2.

Anisotropic Scattering in a Thin Screen

An observer sees an anisotropic distribution of radiation from a screen at distance D. The probability of receiving radiation from the screen at position (θx,θy) is:

[formula]

We suppose without loss of generality that σy  >  σx. If the source is at infinite distance beyond the screen, the delay τ along this path (ignoring any contribution from the screen) is:

[formula]

where c is the speed of light. If the source is at distance R beyond the screen, then D is replaced by RD / (R + D) in this and subsequent equations. We convert the distribution of angles in Equation [\ref=eq:anis_angle_dist] to coordinates (τ,φ), where φ  =   arctan (θy  /  θx). The resulting distribution of (τ,φ) is:

[formula]

where α2  =  σ2y  /  σ2x - 1 parametrizes the anisotropy. We integrate over φ to find the pulse-broadening function:

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Here, I0 is the regular modified Bessel function of order 0, and cτ2 = 2Dσ2y. Note that for α  →  0, this distribution becomes the familiar exponential distribution, with scale τ2, as expected for σx  =  σy.

In the case of α > 0, at small τ the distribution has the limit:

[formula]

At large values,

[formula]

so that

[formula]

At a particular scale τ, the logarithmic derivative of G(τ) is 1 / τ2, although the coefficient depends weakly on τ. Thus, G(τ) exhibits two exponential scales: τ2 at large τ, and τ1  =  τ2 / (1 + α2 / 2) at small τ. The relative strength of the scales is about

[formula]

near the larger scale τ2, with the larger scale being the weaker.
