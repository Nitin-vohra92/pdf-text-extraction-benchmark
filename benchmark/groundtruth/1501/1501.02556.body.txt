On two moduli spaces of sheaves supported on quadric surfaces

Let [formula] be the moduli space of Gieseker semi-stable sheaves F on [formula] having Hilbert polynomial PF(m)  =  4m  +  2, relative to the polarization O(1,1), and first Chern class c1(F)  =  (2,2). Let [formula] be the moduli space of Gieseker semi-stable sheaves F on [formula] having Hilbert polynomial PF(m)  =  m2  +  3m  +  2. Such sheaves are supported on quadric surfaces. The purpose of this note is to show that [formula] is isomorphic to a certain hypersurface in a weighted projective space (see Proposition [\ref=hypersurface]) and to give an elementary proof of a result of Chung and Moon [\cite=chung_moon] stating that [formula] is the blow-up of [formula] at two regular points.

Let l, m, n be positive integers. Let V be a vector space over [formula] of dimension l. The reductive group [formula] acts by conjugation on the vector space [formula] of m  ×  n-matrices with entries in V. The resulting good quotient

[formula]

is called a Kronecker moduli space. Kronecker moduli spaces arise from the study of moduli spaces of torsion-free sheaves, as in [\cite=drezet_reine]. According to [\cite=asterisque] and [\cite=chung_moon], the map

[formula]

is a good quotient modulo [formula]. Thus, the above moduli space is isomorphic to [formula]. According to [\cite=asterisque], [formula] is rational; this result was reproved in [\cite=chung_moon] using the wall-crossing method.

Assume that [formula] contains stable points. Then the same is true of [formula] for all integers k  >  l, and, moreover, [formula] is birational to [formula].

Let U, V be vector spaces over [formula] of dimension k  -  l, respectively, l, and put [formula]. The projection of W onto the second factor induces a G-equivariant projection

[formula]

From King's criterion of semi-stability [\cite=king] we see that

[formula]

The left-hand-side, denoted by E, is a trivial G-linearized vector bundle over [formula] with fiber [formula]. The geometric quotient map

[formula]

is a principal G-bundle, so we can apply [\cite=huybrechts_lehn] to deduce that E descends to a vector bundle F over [formula]. Clearly, F is the geometric quotient of E by G, hence F is isomorphic to an open subset of [formula]. We conclude that [formula] is birational to [formula].

For l  ≥  3, [formula] is rational.

For l  ≥  3 and n  ≥  1, [formula] is rational.

According to [\cite=drezet_reine], [formula] is isomorphic to [formula]. Identifying [formula] with the space of conic curves in [formula], the stable points correspond to irreducible conics. Applying Lemma [\ref=projection], yields (i).

According to [\cite=modules_alternatives], the subset of [formula] of matrices whose maximal minors have no common factor is isomorphic to the subset of [formula] of schemes that are not contained in any curve of degree n - 1. Thus, [formula] is birational to [formula], so it is rational. Moreover, [formula] consists only of stable points. Applying Lemma [\ref=projection], yields (ii).

For l  ≥  3 and n  ≥  1, [formula] is a rational variety.

The argument is inspired by [\cite=asterisque]. In view of [\cite=drezet_reine], [formula] contains stable points. This is due to the fact that we have the inequality x  <  n / n  <  1 / x, where x is the smaller solution to the equation x2  -  3x + 1  =  0. Thus, we are in the context of Lemma [\ref=projection], which asserts that [formula] is rational for l  ≥  3 if [formula] is rational. We may, therefore, restrict to the case when l  =  3. Let V be a vector space over [formula] with basis {x,y,z}. An element [formula] can be written uniquely in the form φ  =  φ1x  +  φ2y  +  φ3z, where [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the open invariant subset given by the condition that φ1 be invertible. Let [formula] be the closed subset given by the condition φ1  =  I. The group [formula] acts on X by conjugation. The composite map

[formula]

is surjective and its fibers are precisely the [formula]-orbits. Thus, it factors through a bijective morphism

[formula]

In characteristic zero, bijective morphisms of irreducible varieties are birational. We have reduced to the following problem. Let U be a complex vector space of dimension 2 and let [formula] act on [formula] by conjugation. Then the resulting good quotient is rational.

Choose a basis {y,z} of U. An element [formula] can be uniquely written in the form ψ  =  yψ1  +  zψ2, where [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the open invariant subset given by the conditions that ψ have trivial stabilizer and that ψ1 be invertible and have distinct eigenvalues. Let [formula] be the closed subset given by the condition that ψ1 be a diagonal matrix. Let [formula] be the image of the canonical embedding of the group of permutations of n elements, respectively, the subgroup of diagonal matrices. Then H  =  ST is a closed subgroup of [formula] leaving Y invariant. The composite map

[formula]

is surjective and its fibers are precisely the H-orbits. Thus, it factors through a bijective morphism

[formula]

that must be birational. We have reduced the problem to showing that Y / H is rational.

Let Y0  ⊂  Y be the open H-invariant subset given by the condition that all entries of ψ2 be non-zero. Concretely, Y0  =  D  ×  E, where [formula] are the subset of invertible diagonal matrices with distinct entries on the diagonal, respectively, the subset of matrices without zero entries. The normal subgroup T  ≤  H acts trivially on D, hence (D  ×  E) / T is a trivial bundle over D with fiber E / T. The induced action of S  =  H / T is compatible with the bundle structure. The stabilizer in S of any ψ1∈D acts trivially on the fiber over ψ1, because it is trivial. It follows that (D  ×  E) / T descents to a fiber bundle F over D / S. Clearly, F is isomorphic to (D  ×  E) / H, hence (D  ×  E) / H is birational to D / S  ×  E / T. Both D / S and E / T are rational, namely D / S is isomorphic to an open subset of [formula], while [formula]. In conclusion, Y / H is rational.

Let r  >  0 and χ be integers. Let [formula] denote the moduli space of Gieseker semi-stable sheaves on [formula] having Hilbert polynomial P(m)  =  rm + χ. It is well known that [formula] is birational to [formula] and, if r is even, [formula] is birational to [formula]. We obtain the following.

The moduli spaces [formula] and, if r is even, [formula], are rational.

The rationality of [formula] and [formula] is already known from [\cite=lepotier_revue].

The maps

[formula]

and

[formula]

are semi-invariant in the sense that for any (g,h)∈G and [formula],

[formula]

Using King's criterion of semi-stability [\cite=king], it is easy to see that φ is semi-stable if and only if det (φ)  ≠  0 and is stable if and only if det (φ) is irreducible in [formula]. In the case when dim (V)  =  3, the isomorphism [formula] of [\cite=drezet_reine] is given by 〈φ〉  ↦  〈 det (φ)〉.

In the sequel we will assume that dim (V)  =  4 and that m  =  2, n  =  2. Choose bases {x,y,z,w} of V and {v1,v2,v3,v4} of V*. Consider the semi-invariant functions

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula] denotes the internal product with a vector v∈V*.

We have the relation ε2  =  ρ.

Let {v1',v2',v3',v4'} be another basis of V* and let [formula] be the change-of-basis matrix. With respect to this basis we define the functions ρ' and ε' as above. Then ε'(φ)  =   det (υ)ε(φ) and ρ'(φ)  =   det (υ)2ρ(φ), hence ε(φ)2  =  ρ(φ) if and only if ε'(φ)2  =  ρ'(φ). Put [formula] and let

[formula]

be the morphism induced by the projection of [formula] onto the first factor. It is enough to verify the relation on the Zariski open subset given by the condition that det (π(φ)) be irreducible. Changing, possibly, the basis of U, we may assume that det (π(φ))  =  x2  -  yz. Since π(φ) is stable, and since [formula] is isomorphic to [formula], we have

[formula]

We have

[formula]

[formula]

Since we are free to choose the basis of V*, we choose {v1,v2,v3,v4} to be the dual of {x,y,z,w}. We have

[formula]

[formula]

In conclusion, ε(φ)2  =  (d  -  a)2  =  ρ(φ).

Consider the action of [formula] on [formula] given by t(q,p)  =  (tq,t2p) and let [formula] denote the weighted projective space [formula]. Consider the map

[formula]

Choose coordinates on [formula] given by the choice of basis {x,y,z,w} of V. In view of Proposition [\ref=functional_relation], the image of η is contained in the hypersurface [formula] given by the equation [formula], where [formula] denotes the resultant of the quadratic form q.

Assume that dim (V)  =  4. Then the map [formula] is an isomorphism.

The singular points of the cone [formula] over H are of the form (q,0), where [formula] is a singular point of the vanishing locus of the resultant. It follows that Ĥ is regular in codimension 1. From Serre's criterion of normality we deduce that H is normal (condition S2 is satisfied because Ĥ is a hypersurface in a smooth variety). Normality is inherited by a good quotient, hence [formula] is normal, too. In view of the Main Theorem of Zariski, it is enough to show that η is bijective. Since [formula] is complete, and since [formula] and H are irreducible of the same dimension, it is enough to show that η is injective.

Assume that η(〈φ1〉)  =  η(〈φ2〉). Varying φ1 and φ2 in their respective orbits, we may assume that det (φ1)  =   det (φ2) and [formula]. If det (φ1) is reducible, say det (φ1)  =  uu' for some u,u'∈V, then it is easy to see that

[formula]

for some u1,u2∈V. But then [formula]. Assume now that det (φ1) is irreducible. There exists a vector w∈V and a subspace U  ⊂  V such that [formula] and det (π(φ1)) is irreducible (notations as at Proposition [\ref=functional_relation]). As mentioned at Proposition [\ref=functional_relation], we may choose a basis {x,y,z} of U such that det (π(φ1)) = x2  -  yz, forcing

[formula]

Thus, we may write

[formula]

The relation det (φ1)  =   det (φ2) yields the relations b1  =  b2, c1  =  c2, a1  +  d1  =  a2  +  d2. The relation [formula] yields the relation a1  -  d1  =  a2  -  d2. We conclude that φ1  =  φ2, hence 〈φ1〉  =  〈φ2〉.

It was already known to Le Potier [\cite=asterisque] that the map

[formula]

is a double cover branched over the locus of singular quadratic surfaces.

In the sequel, we will use the abbreviations [formula], [formula], and [formula] for a sheaf F on [formula] of dimension 1. We quote below [\cite=chung_moon].

The sheaves F giving points in [formula] are precisely the sheaves having one of the following three types of resolution:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

This proposition was proved in [\cite=chung_moon] by the wall-crossing method, however, it was also nearly obtained in [\cite=ballico_huh]. At [\cite=ballico_huh] it is mistakenly claimed that all sheaves in [formula] have resolution ([\ref=type_0]). At a closer inspection, the argument of [\cite=ballico_huh] shows that the sheaves in [formula] satisfying the conditions [formula] and [formula] are precisely the sheaves given by resolution ([\ref=type_0]). Indeed, the exact sequence (50) in [\cite=ballico_huh] reads

[formula]

where H is a locally free sheaf of rank 2 and determinant ω. Dualizing this sequence, we get the exact sequence

[formula]

From this we get the relations

[formula]

The vanishing of [formula] and [formula] implies that H≃2O( - 1, - 1), in which case ([\ref=ballico_huh_sequence]) yields resolution ([\ref=type_0]).

According to [\cite=rendiconti], if F gives a point in [formula], then [formula] and [formula] give points in the moduli space [formula] of semi-stable sheaves on [formula] having Hilbert polynomial P(m)  =  4m and first Chern class c1  =  (2,2). We claim that the sheaves E giving points in [formula] and satisfying the condition [formula] are precisely the structure sheaves of curves [formula] of type (2,2). By the argument of [\cite=ballico_huh], OE gives a stable point in [formula]. Conversely, if E gives a point in [formula] and [formula], then, by the argument of [\cite=dedicata], there is an injective morphism OC  →  E for a curve [formula]. If C did not have type (2,2), then the semi-stability of E would get contradicted. Thus, C has type (2,2) and, comparing Hilbert polynomials, we see that OC≃E. In conclusion, if [formula], then [formula], hence F has resolution ([\ref=type_1]). If [formula], then [formula], hence F has resolution ([\ref=type_2]).

We denote by [formula] the subsets of sheaves given by resolution ([\ref=type_0]), ([\ref=type_1]), respectively, ([\ref=type_2]). Clearly, [formula] is open and [formula], [formula] are divisors isomorphic to [formula]. Let [formula] denote the subset of injective morphisms.

The canonical map from below is a good quotient modulo G:

[formula]

According to [\cite=buchdahl], for any coherent sheaf F on [formula] there is a spectral sequence converging to F in degree zero and to 0 in degrees different from zero, similar to the Beilinson spectral sequence. Its first level [formula] is given by

[formula]

[formula]

and by the exact sequences

[formula]

If F gives a point in [formula], then

[formula]

[formula]

Thus, [formula] has only two non-zero terms: [formula] and [formula]. The relevant part of [formula] is represented in the following table:

[formula]

The sequence degenerates at [formula], hence φ is injective and Coker(φ)≃F. This shows that resolution ([\ref=type_0]) can be obtained from the Beilinson spectral sequence of F. Arguing as at [\cite=dedicata], we can see that resolution ([\ref=type_0]) can be obtained for local flat families of sheaves in [formula], hence γ is a categorical quotient. By the uniqueness of the categorical quotient, we deduce that γ is a good quotient map.

We fix vector spaces V1 and V2 over [formula] of dimension 2 and we make the identifications

[formula]

Let

[formula]

be the open subset of injective morphisms ψ for which Coker(ψ) is Gieseker semi-stable. We represent ψ by a matrix

[formula]

where [formula], uij,vij∈V*j, fij∈V. The algebraic group

[formula]

acts on [formula] by conjugation. We represent elements of [formula] by pairs (g,h), where

[formula]

[formula], [formula], etc.

The canonical map [formula], θ(ψ)  =  〈Coker(ψ)〉 is a good quotient modulo [formula].

Let [formula] be the open subset given by the condition that ψ12 be invertible. Concretely, [formula] is the set of morphisms ψ such that ψ12 is invertible and α(ψ)  =  ψ21  -  ψ22ψ- 112ψ11 is injective. In view of Proposition [\ref=resolutions], [formula]. The restricted map [formula] is the composition

[formula]

where γ is the good quotient map from Corollary [\ref=generic_quotient]. Let [formula] be the closed normal subgroup given by the conditions g11  =  cI, h22  =  cI, [formula]. We have the relation [formula], hence α is constant on the orbits of [formula]. Since any [formula] is equivalent to

[formula]

it follows that the fibers of α are precisely the [formula]-orbits, and that α has a section. We deduce that α is a geometric quotient modulo [formula]. Since γ is a good quotient modulo [formula], we conclude that θ0 is a good quotient modulo [formula]. Let [formula] be the subset of stable points. Since [formula] is a geometric quotient modulo [formula], we deduce that [formula] is a geometric quotient modulo [formula].

Assume now that [formula]. Denote F  =  Coker(ψ). Then ψ12  ≠  0, otherwise Coker(ψ22) would be a destabilizing subsheaf of F. Thus, [formula] is the disjoint union of two subsets [formula] and [formula]. The former is given by the relations a1  ≠  0, a2  =  0; the latter is given by the relations a1  =  0, a2  ≠  0. Assume that [formula]. Then u11, v11 are linearly independent, otherwise F would have a destabilizing quotient sheaf of slope zero. Likewise, u22, v22 are linearly independent, otherwise F would have a destabilizing subsheaf of slope 1. Consider the morphism

[formula]

[formula]

Clearly, F≃Coker(ξ). Applying the snake lemma to the exact diagram

[formula]

we obtain resolution ([\ref=type_1]). This shows that [formula]. It is now easy to see that the restricted map [formula] is surjective and that its fibers are precisely the [formula]-orbits. By symmetry, the same is true of the restricted map [formula].

Let [formula] be the open subset of stable points and [formula]. We have proved above that the fibers of the restricted map [formula] are precisely the [formula]-orbits. Since [formula] is normal (being smooth), we can apply [\cite=popov_vinberg] to deduce that [formula] is a geometric quotient modulo [formula]. Finally, since [formula], we deduce that θ is a good quotient map.

Choose bases {u1,v1} of V*1 and {u2,v2} of V*2. Then [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] form a basis of V. An easy calculation shows that the set of injective morphisms

[formula]

is the subset of matrices whose determinant is not a multiple of xw  -  yz. Thus,

[formula]

According to Remark [\ref=double_cover], det - 1{〈xw  -  yz〉} consists of two points ν1 and ν2, where ε(ν1)  =  1, ε(ν2)  =   - 1. We saw at Corollary [\ref=generic_quotient] that γ induces an isomorphism

[formula]

The inverse of this isomorphism is denoted by

[formula]

It is natural to ask whether [formula] is the blow-up of [formula] at ν1 and ν2. This is, indeed, one of the main results in [\cite=chung_moon], where a blowing-down map [formula] is constructed via Fourier-Mukai transforms of sheaves, in view of the identification of [formula] with [formula]. We give below an alternate construction.

The map β0 extends to a blowing-down map [formula] with exceptional divisor [formula] and blowing-up locus {ν1,ν2}.

Recall that on [formula], β0 is induced by the map sending ψ to

[formula]

Equivalently, β0 is induced by the map sending ψ to

[formula]

which is defined on [formula]. Clearly, this map factors through a morphism [formula], which maps [formula] to the class of the matrix

[formula]

that is, to ν1. Analogously, β0 extends to a morphism defined on [formula], which maps [formula] to the class of the matrix

[formula]

that is, to ν2. The two morphisms constructed thus far glue to a morphism [formula]. Since ν1 and ν2 are smooth points, β is a blow-down.
