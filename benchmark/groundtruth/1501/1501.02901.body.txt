Functionally σ-discrete mappings and a generalization of Banach's theorem

Introduction

Let X be a topological space and A be a family of subsets of X. We define classes Fα(A) and Gα(A) in the following way: F0(A) = A, [formula] and for all 1  ≤  α  <  ω1 let If A is the collection of all /functionally/ closed subsets of X, then elements of Fα(A) or Gα(A) are called sets of the α'th /functionally/ multiplicative class or sets of the α'th /functionally/ additive class, respectively; elements of the family [formula] are called /functionally/ ambiguous sets of the class α.

A mapping f:X  →  Y between topological spaces belongs to the α'th /functionally/ Lebesgue class, if the preimage f- 1(V) of any open set V  ⊆  Y is of the α'th /functionally/ additive class α in X. The collection of all mappings of the α'th /functionally/ Lebesgue class we denote by Hα(X,Y) /Kα(X,Y)/. Notice that Hα(X,Y) = Kα(X,Y) for any perfectly normal space X and any topological space Y.

By C(X,Y) we denote the class of all continuous mappings between X and Y.

Let Φ1(X,Y) = H1(X,Y) and for all 1 < α  <  ω1 the symbol Φα(X,Y) stands for the collection of all mappings between X and Y which are pointwise limits of sequences of mappings from [formula]. The next result is the classical Banach's theorem [\cite=BanachS:1931].

R. Hansell in [\cite=Hansell:1971] introduced the concept of σ-discrete mapping as a convenient tool for the investigation of mappings with values in non-separable spaces. A mapping f:X  →  Y is σ-discrete if there exists a family [formula] of subsets of X such that every family Bn is discrete in X and the preimage f- 1(V) of any open set V in Y is a union of sets from B. Class of all σ-discrete mappings between X and Y is denoted by Σ(X,Y). In [\cite=Hansell:1974] Hansell proved the following generalization of Banach's theorem.

In this paper we develop technique from [\cite=Hansell:1974] and [\cite=Fos] and prove an analogue of Theorem [\ref=thm:Hansell] for an arbitrary topological space X. To do this we introduce classes of mappings Σfα(X,Y). Namely, a mapping f:X  →  Y belongs to Σfα(X,Y), where 0  ≤  α  <  ω1, if there exist a family [formula] of functionally ambiguous sets of the class α in X and a family [formula] of functionally open subsets of X, where Un = (UB:B∈Bn), such that every family Un is discrete in X, [formula] for every B∈Bn and the preimage f- 1(V) of any open set V in Y is a union of sets from B. Properties of this class are studied in Section [\ref=sect:sigma]. Let us observe that the class Σfα(X,Y) coincides with the class of all σ-discrete mappings of the α'th Lebesgue class in case X is a perfectly normal space and Y is a metric space. Auxiliary technical propositions are gathered in Section [\ref=sect:lemmas_sets]. The forth section contains three approximation lemmas which are crucial in the proof of the main theorem. In Section [\ref=sect:main_results] we present classes Λα which are close to classes Φα: let Λ1(X,Y) = Σf1(X,Y), and for all 1 < α  <  ω1 let Λα(X,Y) be the collection of all mappings between X and Y which are pointwise limits of sequences of mappings from [formula]. The theorem below is the main result of the paper. An example at the end of the fifth section shows that the assertion on X in Theorem [\ref=thm:Hansell] is essential.

Properties of σ-strongly functionally discrete mappings

A family A = (Ai:i∈I) of subsets of a topological space X is called

discrete, if every point of X has an open neighborhood which intersects with at most one set from A;

strongly discrete, if there exists a discrete family (Ui:i∈I) of open subsets of X such that [formula] for every i∈I;

strongly functionally discrete or, briefly, sfd-family, if there exists a discrete family (Ui:i∈I) of functionally open subsets of X such that [formula] for every i∈I;

well strongly functionally discrete of well sfd-family, if there exist discrete families (Ui:i∈I) of functionally open sets and (Fi:i∈I) of functionally closed sets such that Ai  ⊆  Fi  ⊆  Ui for every i∈I.

Notice that (4) ⇒   (3) ⇒   (2) ⇒   (1) for any X; a topological space X is collectionwise normal if and only if every discrete family in X is strongly discrete; if X is normal then (2) ⇔   (3).

Let P be a property of a family of sets. A family A is called a σ-P-family if [formula], where every family An has the property P.

A family B of sets of a topological space X is called a base for a mapping f:X  →  Y if the preimage f- 1(V) of an arbitrary open set V in Y is a union of sets from B.

If a mapping f:X  →  Y has a base which is a σ-P-family, then we say that f is a σ-P mapping.

The collection of all σ-P mappings between X and Y we will denote by

Σ(X,Y), if P is a property of discreteness;

Σ*(X,Y), if P is a property of a strong discreteness;

Σf(X,Y), if P is a property of a strong functional discreteness.

By Σfα(X,Y) /Σf *α(X,Y)/ we denote the collection of all mappings between X and Y which has a σ-sfd base of functionally ambiguous /multiplicative/ sets of the class α in X.

Let us observe that every continuous mapping f:X  →  Y is σ-strongly functionally discrete if either X, or Y is a metric space, since every metric space has σ-sfd base of open sets. Clearly, every mapping with values in a second countable space is σ-sfd. In [\cite=Hansell:1971] Hansell proved that any Borel measurable mapping f:X  →  Y is σ-discrete if X is a complete metric space and Y is a metric space.

Let 0  ≤  α  <  ω1, X be a topological space, (Ui:i∈I) be a locally finite family of functionally open sets in X, (Bi:i∈I) be a family of sets of the α'th functionally additive /multiplicative/ class in X such that Bi  ⊆  Ui for every i∈I. Then the set [formula] is of the α'th functionally additive /multiplicative/ class α in X.

For any 0  ≤  α  <  ω1 a union of an sfd-family of sets of the α'th functionally additive /multiplicative/ class in a topological space is a set of the same class.

Let X be a topological space and f∈Σf(X,Y). Then f has a σ-sfd base B which is a union of a sequence of well sfd-families.

Let 0 < α  <  ω1, X be a topological space and Y be a topological space with a σ-disjoint base. Then

[formula]

Let 0 < α  <  ω1, X and Y be topological spaces. Then

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=LebesgueSFDisSFD0] and Proposition [\ref=Sigma0isK1] imply

Let 0 < α  <  ω1, X be a topological space and Y be a space with a σ-disjoint base. Then

[formula]

Let 0  ≤  α  <  ω1, X, Y and Z be topological spaces, f∈Σfα(X,Y), g∈Σfα(Y,Z) and let h:X  →  Y  ×  Z is defined by

[formula]

for every x∈X. Then h∈Σfα(X,Y  ×  Z).

We say that a family (Ai:i∈I) is a partition of a space X if [formula] and [formula] for i  ≠  j.

Let 0  ≤  α  <  ω1, [formula] be a partition of a topological space X by functionally ambiguous sets of the class α, (fn)∞n = 1 be a sequence of mappings from Σfα(X,Y) and f(x) = fn(x) if x∈Xn for some n. Then f∈Σfα(X,Y).

Auxiliary facts on functionally measurable sets

The proofs of the next two lemmas are completely similar to the proofs of Theorem 2 from [\cite=Kuratowski:Top:1] and Theorem 2 from [\cite=Kuratowski:Top:1].

Let 0 < α  <  ω1 and X be a topological space. Then for any disjoint sets A,B  ⊆  X of the α'th functionally multiplicative class there exists a functionally ambiguous set C of the class α such that [formula].

If A is a functionally ambiguous set of the (α + 1)'th class in a topological space X, where α is a limit ordinal, then there exists a sequence (An)∞n = 1 of functionally ambiguous sets of classes <  α such that

The definition of sfd-family easily implies the following fact.

Let A1,, An be sfd-families of subsets of a topological space X, [formula] for [formula] and the family [formula] is strongly functionally discrete. Then the family [formula] is strongly functionally discrete.

Let 0 < α  <  ω1, A be a disjoint σ-sfd family of functionally additive sets of the α'th class in a topological space X. Then for any A∈A there exists an increasing sequence (DAn)∞n = 1 of functionally ambiguous sets of the class α such that [formula] and the family (DAn:A∈A) is strongly functionally discrete for every [formula].

If α  =  β + 1, then every set DAn can be chosen from the β'th functionally multiplicative class.

Let 0  ≤  α  <  ω1, X be a topological space, A be an σ-sfd family of sets of the α'th functionally multiplicative class such that [formula]. Then there exists a sequence (An)∞n = 1 of families of sets of the α'th functionally multiplicative class such that

[formula],

[formula],

An is an sfd-family,

[formula]

for every [formula].

Approximation lemmas

We say that a sequence (fn)∞n = 1 of mappings fn:X  →  Y is stably convergent to f:X  →  Y and denote this fact by [formula], if for every x∈X there exists [formula] such that fn(x) = f(x) for all n  ≥  n0.

If A  ⊆  YX, then the symbol [formula] stands for the set of all stable limits of sequences from A.

Let X, Y be topological spaces, ((Bi,m:i∈Im))∞m = 1 be a sequence of sfd-families of sets of the (α + 1)'th functionally ambiguous sets in X, α be a limit ordinal, let the family [formula] be a partition of X, ((yi,m:i∈Im))∞m = 1 be a sequence of points from Y and let f:X  →  Y is defined by

[formula]

if x∈Bi,m for some [formula] and i∈Im. Then [formula].

Let α  <  ω1 be a limit ordinal, X be a topological space, Y be a metric space and f∈Σfα + 1(X,Y). Then there exists a sequence of mappings [formula] which is uniformly convergent to f on X.

Let 0 < α  <  ω1, X be a topological space, (Y,d) be a metric space, f:X  →  Y be a mapping, [formula] be families of subsets of X such that

Ak is an sfd-family of sets of the α'th functionally multiplicative class;

[formula] for k < n;

[formula] for all A∈Ak

for every [formula]. Then there exists a mapping g∈Σfα(X,Y) such that the inclusion [formula] for [formula] implies the inequality

A generalization of Banach's theorem

Let X, Y be topological spaces and A  ⊆  YX. By [formula] we denote the set of all pointwise limits of sequences of mappings from A.

We put

[formula]

and for all 1 < α  <  ω1 let

[formula]

Clearly,

[formula]

if β  ≤  α. Moreover,

[formula]

and if α  =   sup   αn is a limit ordinal, then

[formula]

Let X be a topological space, (Y,d) be a metric space. Then

Σfα(X,Y)  ⊆  Λα(X,Y), if 1  ≤  α  ≤  ω0;

Σfα + 1(X,Y)  ⊆  Λα(X,Y), if ω0  ≤  α  <  ω1.

Let X be a topological space, Y be a space with a σ-disjoint base. Then the class Σf(X,Y) is closed under pointwise limits.

Let X be a topological space, Y be a perfectly normal space, 0  ≤  α  <  ω1 and let (fn)∞n = 1 be a sequence of mappings fn∈Kα(X,Y) which converges pointwise to a mapping f:X  →  Y. Then f∈Kα + 1(X,Y).

Let X be a topological space, Y be a perfectly normal space with a σ-disjoint base and 0 < α  <  ω1. Then

Λα(X,Y)  ⊆  Σfα(X,Y), if α  <  ω0,

Λα(X,Y)  ⊆  Σfα + 1(X,Y), if α  ≥  ω0.

Combining Theorems [\ref=finite_classes] and [\ref=thm:Lambda_is_Sigma] we get the following result.

Let X be a topological space, Y be a metric space and 0 < α  <  ω1. Then

Λα(X,Y) = Σfα(X,Y), if α  <  ω0,

Λα(X,Y) = Σfα + 1(X,Y), if α  ≥  ω0.

Finally, we show that the condition on X to be perfect in Theorem [\ref=thm:Hansell] is essential.
