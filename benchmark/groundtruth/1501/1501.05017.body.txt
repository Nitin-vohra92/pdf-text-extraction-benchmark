Antenna Array Characterization via Radio Interferometry Observation of Astronomical Sources

Introduction

As with any antenna engineering project, characterization of low-frequency radio astronomy arrays (referred to as "aperture arrays" to distinguish them from dish antennas) is required to validate that the design meets requirements and that modeling tools involved in the process are reliable. Low-frequency aperture arrays (LFAA) are particularly challenging to measure for a combination of reasons: they are difficult to point mechanically, are more closely coupled to the environment (see array placement in Fig. [\ref=fig:jan2014]) and their physical area is large for a given directivity (scales by λ2). As a consequence of the latter, larger distances (scales by the square of the array diameter) are required to satisfy the far-field condition. Without specialized facilities, measurements of LFAAs in an anechoic chamber or outdoor range are not practical. The capability of testing larger-diameter LFAAs will be important in the pre-construction work of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope [\cite=VaaLer11].

In-situ LFAA measurements offers a number of obvious advantages: no bespoke facility is required and the array is situated in the intended environment. Fig. [\ref=fig:jan2014] illustrates the AUT: an array of 16 dual-polarized log-periodic "SKALA" antennas [\cite=EloyICEAA12] deployed at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in the Mid West region of Western Australia [\cite=AAVS05_ICEAA13]. Unlike measurements in an anechoic chamber where the operator has full control of the RF sources, astronomical sources are beyond our control. This is especially true in low-frequency radio astronomy, where the spatially extended component of the emission from the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy is the dominant source of noise [\cite=Kraus_RA_1986_ch8]. Meaningful LFAA measurement, therefore, requires exclusion of the diffuse Galactic emission while maintaining responsiveness to previously well-characterized, point-like extragalactic sources; this may be accomplished by cross-correlating the output voltages of pairs of AUTs which are spaced with sufficient distance such that the Galactic noise is uncorrelated. This concept will be discussed in Sec. [\ref=sec:theory]. Measurement results are and conclusions are presented in Secs. [\ref=sec:results] and [\ref=ref:concl] respectively.

Background Theory

Measurand

The sensitivity of a radio telescope is quantified by the ratio of its effective aperture area ([formula] in m2) to the system noise temperature (Tsys in K):

[formula]

This figure-of-merit is a key term in the expression for the telescope output signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio; many readers will recognize that it is similar and is convertible to G / T which is common in telecommunications. The antenna beam pattern may be obtained by measuring A / T along the apparent trajectory of a suitable astronomical source. This assumes that the sky noise does not change Tsys appreciably during the observation; in practice, this is a reasonable approximation.

Measurement Method

This subsection presents a simplified version of how A / T is obtained in radio interferometry. Interested readers are referred to standard textbooks such as [\cite=taylor_synthesis_1999] and [\cite=tms01] for more complete discussions. Let us assume an interferometer involving 3 single-polarized antennas (or antenna arrays as the case may be) observing a point source with flux S (in W/m2/Hz or Jy) in its phase center (in this context "phase center" refers to that position in the sky for which the interferometer is intended to point to by applying relative phase shifts between its elements). The measured cross-correlation products are:

[formula]

where ã is referred to as complex "gain" (voltage quantity) containing a combination of both antenna and receiver electronic gains. Assuming S is known, the complex "gains" may be solved from these 3 equations. This is typically done by solving the amplitudes and phases separately [\cite=taylor_synthesis_1999].

To obtain antenna gains, amplitude-only solutions are sufficient. Note that this method is analogous to the well-known "three-antenna" measurement technique [\cite=Kummer_1978]. With N elements, N(N - 1) / 2 pair-wise combinations ("baselines") are available, leading to an overdetermined system solvable with a least-squares method. As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:AAVS05_mwa], the AAVS 0.5 is co-located with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope [\cite=2013PASA...30....7T] [\cite=Lonsdale_2009] to take advantage of this multi-baseline arrangement (with N = 128) to minimize calibration uncertainties. Each of the MWA's 128 "tiles" is a 16-antenna array of bow-tie dipoles.

By selecting interferometry baselines larger than a certain minimum, the dominant spatially-extended Galactic noise is no longer correlated and "bright" point-like sources are detectable. This may be illustrated by examining the spatial coherence function due to a distributed source (Ch. 1 in [\cite=taylor_synthesis_1999]):

[formula]

where V12 is the complex visibility on the baseline between antennas 1 and 2, I(l,m) is the sky brightness distribution, u,v are the baseline vector components normalized to wavelength and l,m are the direction cosines with respect to û, of a unit vector [formula] where ŵ is a unit vector normal to the uv plane (i.e., points to the "phase center").

Simplifying further to the 1-D case, ([\ref=eqn:visibility2D]) becomes

[formula]

where l =  sin θ' and θ' is the angle between ŵ and [formula]. We recognize V12 and I(l) as a Fourier transform pair. Hence, structures with large l extent are mostly visible for small u12. From MWA observing experience, with its small-diameter (3.3 m) tiles, correlated Galactic noise is measurable on baselines of length < 30λ and should therefore be excluded.

It can be shown (see Ch. 9 of [\cite=taylor_synthesis_1999]) that after calibration of the measured cross-correlation products, the standard deviation in flux density for each baseline is inversely proportional to the square root of the products of the A / T for the AUTs in question:

[formula]

where k is Boltzmann's constant, B is the bandwidth and tacc is the accumulation time. Thus, by measuring ΔS for all baselines for which the Galactic noise is uncorrelated, A / T for each AUT may be solved.

Characterization Results

To measure A / T through cross-correlation, we point the interferometer towards Hydra A, a compact calibrator source that is sufficiently bright for a good S/N calibration solution to be obtained from a 2 minute snapshot observation (). The AAVS 0.5 and MWA tile pointing is achieved with 5-bit, time-delay analog RF beamformers. The data is channelised prior to correlation into channels of width B=40 kHz, and averaged post-correlation to tacc=4 s. For each channel, ΔSij is calculated for all samples in the snapshot period.

Sensitivity

shows an A / T measurement for a snapshot, made on 22 May 2014, where the channels comprising the 30.72 MHz bandwidth have been grouped at 6 points across the available 75-300 MHz frequency range. The top panel shows the X (E-W) antenna polarization in cyan dots, the lower panel shows the Y (N-S) polarization in blue dots. In this observation, both the AAVS 0.5 array and the MWA tiles were pointed at Hydra A, at azimuth (clockwise from North) Az=0, elevation El=75.4. The scattering of data points at ~  270 MHz is due to the persistent satellite-based RFI corrupting the measurement in these channels.

also shows simulated results of this measurement as dashed curves; these follow and include measured receiver temperature, and the sky model [\cite=2008MNRAS.388..247D] and array gain pattern at the time of observation. We used full-wave electromagnetic (FEKO) simulation to determine the array gain pattern for each polarization, and with a ground of either 2% or 10% moisture to represent a reasonable range of the likely soil moisture level experienced at the MRO [\cite=SutHal14].

The measured and simulated results show good agreement at all frequency points. With the exception of the corrupted data at ~  270 MHz, the tight clustering of the results at each frequency point gives us confidence in the measurement process.

Beam pattern

Sensitivity can also be measured at Az, El angles away from the beam pointing direction enabling investigation of beam pattern. This is achieved by keeping the AAVS 0.5 beam pointed in a fixed direction while tracking the calibrator source with the MWA. shows the X-polarization beam for such a measurement, where the MWA tracks Hydra A over a 4 hour period and the AAVS 0.5 beam remains pointed at Az=0, El=75.4. For each snapshot and channel, calibration is performed and A / T is calculated for the AAVS 0.5 beam at the direction of Hydra A. The data is normalized to the beam maximum. For clarity, only the 2% moisture case is shown, as the difference with the 10% case is not significant.

is a slice through the AAVS 0.5 beam pattern corresponding to the Az, El trajectory of Hydra A; the simulated results in are for the same trajectory. The solid orange curve simulates the real-world scenario where the sky "seen" by the AAVS 0.5 beam varies as a function of time, inducing changes in Tsys. The dashed curve is simply the beam pattern (i.e. no sky is present).

Towards the end of the observation (~  23:10), the sidelobe level from the model sky curve is decreasing relative to the "no sky" curve; this is caused by a reduction in A / T due to increasing sky noise. However, the small difference between the two beam simulations is encouraging, indicating that the measured beam pattern (which intrinsically varies with time) is representative of the actual beam pattern, at least for the sky near Hydra A.

We also estimate errors in the beam pattern introduced due to the analog RF beamforming system. Our estimate of the errors is calculated from measured phase (σφ = 0.069) and amplitude (σa = 0.10) errors. The calculation for the ensemble mean beam pattern (sidelobe level) that incorporates these errors is well-known [\cite=Zucker_ant2_1969_ch21] [\cite=Mailloux_2005_ch7] [\cite=Hansen_1998_ch7]; for our results there is no significant difference to the error-free beam pattern. We plot in purple the estimated [formula] error on the mean pattern, where σ is approximated using the formula in [\cite=1138220] for large N. These curves show that main beam and most of the sidelobes are within 2σ of the mean beam pattern; the exception being the first sidelobe at 20:38, which is [formula] from the mean beam pattern.

Conclusion

This work demonstrates far-field sensitivity and beam pattern characterization of a low-frequency aperture array. The measurements are in-situ, both in terms of physical location and intended astronomical use. The interferometric observation of astronomical sources using the MWA radio telescope and the AAVS 0.5 array under test results in measurements calibrated to an absolute scale. The sensitivity measurements and their frequency-dependent trends are consistent with simulated results. The measured and simulated beam patterns generally show good agreement as to the location and height of the sidelobes within the error. This type of characterization will be essential for verifying the performance of future prototype low-frequency aperture arrays deployed at the MRO.
