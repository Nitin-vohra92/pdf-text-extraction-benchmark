Whole body counter surveys of Miharu-town school children for four consecutive years after the Fukushima NPP accident

Introduction

Nearly four years have elapsed since the start of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident [\cite=tanaka], which began in March, 2011. Because of the large amounts of radionuclides deposited on soil and water in Fukushima Prefecture and surrounding regions of Japan, the risk of serious internal radiation exposure for residents was of great concern initially, but most data accumulated and disseminated so far have consistently shown that the internal contamination for the overwhelming majority of residents has fortunately been so low as to be undetectable [\cite=unscear2013]. The data include, for example, whole-body-counter surveys [\cite=hayano2013] [\cite=nagataki] [\cite=tsubo1] [\cite=tsubo2], duplicate-diet studies [\cite=coop], the inspection of "all rice in all rice bags" harvested in Fukushima (2012-2014) [\cite=rice].

This does not mean that the lives of Fukushima residents have returned to normal, however. A survey conducted by Fukushima City in May, 2013, [\cite=fukushimacity] indicated that about 80% of Fukushima City residents are still concerned about the risk of internal radiation exposures from food. Another study showed that about three quarters of the parents of Minamisoma school children buy only non-Fukushima produced foodstuffs at the grocery store, out of fear of radioactive contamination [\cite=minamisomaschool].

In this regard, the results of the whole-body-counter surveys of Miharu-town school children, conducted for four consecutive years (2011-2014) with high (> 90%) coverage provide valuable sampling-bias-free information, are worth reporting, particularly because the majority of the children are regularly consuming local/home-grown foodstuffs, as will be shown later.

The Town of Miharu (population ~  18,000), located about 50 km west of Fukushima Dai-ichi, is in the suburbs of Koriyama city (population ~  330,000). As shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:map], the soil contamination level, inferred from the airborne radiation monitoring results (November 2013) is moderate in the southern part of the town, and is slightly higher in the northern part. The percentage of agricultural households is about 20%. There are six municipally-operated primary schools, attended by approximately 800 children in all, and two secondary schools, with about 500 children in total. In the fall of 2011, the Miharu-town school board decided to have all the school children tested for internal radiation exposures. This was continued in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

The results of the 2011-2013 internal-contamination surveys have been reported in Ref. [\cite=miharu]. Although the results of the questionnaires of 2012-2013 indicated that approximately 60% of the children had been regularly eating local or home-grown rice, in 2012 and 2013 no child was found to exceed the 137Cs detection limit of 300 Bq/body.

This present paper reports the results of the 2014 internal-contamination surveys, in which we used a newly-developed whole-body counter called Babyscan [\cite=babyscan], having a detection limit of <  50 Bq/body, for children with a height of less than 130 cm.

The study was endorsed by the Miharu-town school board, and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo.

Details of the 2014 surveys

In 2014, 1,265 children from Miharu Town between the ages of 6 and 15 (Fig. [\ref=fig:age]) were scanned for of 134Cs and 137Cs using whole-body counters at the Hirata central hospital (Fig. [\ref=fig:map]). In this group, children taller than 130 cm were measured with a standing-type whole-body counter (Fastscan Model 55 2251, Canberra Inc.). The nominal detection limits were 300 Bq/body for both 134Cs and 137Cs following a 2-minute scan. Those shorter than 130 cm were measured with a newly-developed whole-body counter for small children (Babyscan, Canberra Inc.), having nominal detection limits of 50 Bq/body following a 4-minute scan (Fig. [\ref=fig:age_vs_height]). In addition, before the WBC measurement, all of the parents of the participating children were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their family's food and water consumption, the results of which will be discussed later.

The quality of the data can be inferred from Fig. [\ref=fig:weight_vs_k40], which shows the correlation between the subjects' weight and the measured activity of 40K in the body. Overall fit to the data points yielded a coefficient 55.3  ±  0.9 Bq/kg, consistent with the known amount of 40K in human body. The data obtained with the Babyscan show much smaller spread than those with the Fastscan, demonstrating the higher sensitivity (and hence lower detection limit) of the former.

As in previous years, no child was found to exceed the nominal detection limits; this was true even for the small children measured with the Babyscan. Table [\ref=tab:miharu] summarizes the 2014 results, together with those in 2011-2013.

In more detail, Fig. [\ref=fig:mdabody] shows the minimum detectable activity [\cite=currie] (MDA for 137Cs (Bq/body) versus body weight, calculated for each subject from the statistical fluctuation of the gamma-ray spectrum at around 662 keV (the energy of the gamma-ray emitted in the 137Cs decay). As shown, the measured MDAs are lower than the nominal ones being used at the Hirata Central Hospital (300 Bq/body for Fastscan, and 50 Bq/body for Babyscan). Fig. [\ref=fig:mdaratio] shows that the 134Cs-to-137Cs MDA ratios were about 0.9. For simplicity, we use the 137Cs MDAs in the following discussions.

Discussion

Upper limit of daily ingestion of 137Cs

From the MDAs of the 137Cs, we estimate the upper limit of daily ingestion of 137Cs using a constant, long-term intake scenario. Assuming daily intake of 1 Bq, the equilibrium plateau values of 137Cs body burden were calculated using Mondal3 software [\cite=mondal3] for ages 3 months, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and adults, and the calculated results were fitted with a smooth interpolating curve, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:mondal3]. Due to the shorter biological halflife, the plateau body burden is lower for younger children, and this is why we used the Babyscan to screen small children in this study.

Using the age-vs-body burden curve shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:mondal3], we calculated the upper limit of 137Cs daily intake for the nominal detection limit of 300 (50) Bq/body, shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:intakeupperlimit] in blue (orange) curves. Also shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:intakeupperlimit] are the estimated intake upper limits calculated from the actual MDAs of the Miharu school children. For those scanned with Babyscan, the estimated ingestion upper limit is 1 Bq/day (for 6-year old). This results in a committed effective dose below ~  4μSv/year (~  8μSv/year if the 134Cs contribution is included). For this reason we conclude that the concomitant health risk is negligibly small.

Analysis of the questionnaire

In the questionnaire filled out by parents regarding their family's food and water consumption, we asked

drinking water: choice of: 1. well water, 2. tap water, 3. bottled water

rice: choice of: 1. avoid Fukushima rice, 2. do not care about the source, 3. buy Fukushima rice, 4. eat home/local rice

vegetables: choice of: 1. avoid Fukushima produce 2. do not care about the source, 3. buy Fukushima produce, 4. eat home/local produce after being tested for radioactivity, 5. eat untested home/local produce

Fig. [\ref=fig:waterricevegetable] shows a summary graph, and Table [\ref=tab:cross] gives the actual numbers in the form of a cross table.

As shown, about 75 % of Miharu families drink tap and well water, 80 % eat Fukushima rice, and 75 % eat Fukushima vegetables (some 10% regularly eat home-grown or local vegetables that have not been tested for radioactivity). This is in sharp contrast to the situation in the city of Minamisoma, where about 3/4 of families answered that they avoid local/Fukushima produce [\cite=minamisomaschool].

The current study supports previous ones which have suggested that the risk of significant internal radiation exposures among the population of Fukushima remains small, even among people who consistently eat locally-grown produce.

Correspondence analysis of the water-rice-vegetable cross table

Figure [\ref=fig:waterricevegetable] shows that about 20% of the families buy bottled water, and about 15% avoid Fukushima produce, which appears to suggest that the choice of bottled water and avoidance of Fukushima produce may be correlated.

In order to confirm this, we performed a correspondence analysis [\cite=ca] using a standard mathematical procedure of row principal scoring [\cite=ca1], the result of which is graphically displayed in Fig. [\ref=fig:bottledwater]. Black circles are for the choice of drinking water and red circles are for the choice of rice and vegetables. In this graph, the area of the red circles are proportional to the entries in the last row of Table [\ref=tab:cross]. The solid line drawn through the "Bottle" circle represent the principal axes for those who buy bottled water, and the intersection of the dotted lines drawn perpendicular to the solid line indicate the relative "distance" of the choice of rice/vegetable to the choice of bottled water. As shown, those who buy bottled water tend to avoid Fukushima rice/vegetables.

Conclusions

In conclusion, comprehensive whole-body counter surveys of Miharu Town school children have been conducted for four consecutive years, in 2011-2014. This represents the only long-term, sampling-bias-free internal contamination study conducted after the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. For the first time, in 2014, the Babyscan, which has a low 134 / 137Cs MDA of <  50 Bq/body, was used to screen children shorter than 130 cm. No child in this group was found to have detectable level of radiocesium. Using the MDAs, the upper limits of daily intake of radiocesium were estimated for each child. For those screened with the Babyscan, the upper limits were found to be [formula] Bq/day for 137Cs, which is consistent with the results of other studies, such as the duplicate diet study conducted by Co-op Fukushima [\cite=coop]. Analysis of the questionnaire filled out by the parents of the children regarding their families' food and water consumption revealed that the majority of Miharu children regularly consume local or home-grown rice and vegetables. This has not resulted in an increased body burden, however, compared to children who consume only non-Fukushima food. This however does not increase the body burden. Correspondence analysis of the questionnaire results indicated that families which buy bottled water also tend to avoid Fukushima produce. Differences in risk perception clearly exist among populations living in different parts of Fukushima. Similar correspondence analysis conducted for different Fukushima communities may provide useful information for clarifying concerns related to food and other perceived risks, and planning appropriate interventions.
