The role of the Rashba coupling on dynamical induced electromotive force: A Berry curvature investigation

INTRODUCTION

During the last decades, a big effort has been devoted to the investigation of the magneto-resistive systems. These investigations have been performed in the hope that the non-equilibrium charge and spin currents can be controlled by magnetic structure of the system. Modulation of the electric current in magnetic structures can be employed in new generation of electronic devices. One type of such systems, are known as giant magneto-resistive (GMR) structures have already used in the fabrication of new generation of hard-disk and read-heads [\cite=Tsang] [\cite=Tsang2] [\cite=solin].  Among the magnetic structures very interesting transport properties have been reported for magnetic domain walls (DWs). It was shown that the magneto-resistance (MR) of a domain wall (DW) can be of either sign. In both type of theoretical and experimental works positive and negative MR has been reported for the DW [\cite=Greg] [\cite=Lep] [\cite=Levy] [\cite=Rudi] [\cite=cetin] [\cite=Tatara]. Therefore transport in the DW has become a controversial dilemma which deserves some attention to understand the underlying physics of the charge transfer in magnetic modulated structures.  A central problem of spintronics research is the understanding the relation between the electronic transport and the dynamics of magnetic background. The presence of a DW changes the electrical resistance of a ferromagnetic conductor [\cite=PhysRevLett.77.1580] [\cite=PhysRevLett.78.3773] [\cite=PhysRevLett.83.4401] [\cite=PhysRevB.65.224419].  The DW response to the external current could be investigated with another point of view in which the dynamics of DW and mutual effects between the domain and spin of carriers have been considered. It was reported that DWs could be driven at high electric currents. This effect can be considered as DW dynamics in the presence of spin torque generated by spin current. Therefore DW can be driven by spin-transfer process [\cite=DW_motion] [\cite=DW_motion2].  The possibility of the inverse of this effect has also been predicted by Berger in 1986 which known as ferro-Josephson effect [\cite=Berger]. In this effect an electromotive force (emf) has been generated by a moving DW. In recent years this effect has been reported experimentally by Shenyang et al [\cite=PhysRevLett.102.067201]. They calculate theoretically and detect experimentally the electromotive force in a nano-strip induced by a moving magnetic DW. Their results showed that the electromotive force depends only on the topological nature of DW [\cite=PhysRevLett.102.067201]. The result obtained by Berger have been reformulated by others via alternative approaches [\cite=PhysRevLett.102.067201] [\cite=apl.Barnes] [\cite=PhysRevLett.98.246601] [\cite=PhysRevB.76.184434] [\cite=PhysRevB.77.014409] [\cite=PhysRevB.79.014407] [\cite=PhysRevB.77.134407] [\cite=PhysRevB.77.054439]. It was shown by Barens and Meekawa that the electromotive force is a spin Berry phase manifestation in the adiabatic transport [\cite=PhysRevLett.98.246601] around a closed loop. Numerical investigations demonstrate the existence of a spin-motive force acting on spin carriers in a precessing DW in which the spin-motive force has the same magnitude as the one described by Barnes and Maekawa [\cite=PhysRevB.77.054439]. Nonadiabatic corrections have been taken into account to determine the voltage generated by a field-driven transverse DW, for both the diffusive and ballistic regimes [\cite=PhysRevB.77.054439] [\cite=PhysRevB.79.014407]. Where the effects of anisotropic magnetoresistance on the induced voltage have been also considered. It was also shown that the ferro-Josephson effect could be explained by using a non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach [\cite=PhysRevB.76.184434].  By using a local gauge-invariant formalism it was shown by Yang and et al that this electromotive force generation can be explained as a real space topological pumping effect [\cite=MacDonald]. Meanwhile they have demonstrated that the rigid translation of the DW without precession, which takes place when the DW driving magnetic field is less than the Walker breakdown [\cite=Walker], cannot induce electromotive force by the topological pumping. It was shown that the spin precession has the main role in generation of the electromotive force. This means that even the precessing of pinned DWs at rest could generate electromotive force along the system [\cite=MacDonald].  In the present work we have employed the same approach when the inversion symmetry has been broken by the Rashba coupling. Calculations have been performed for different types of the magnetic modulated structures such as DWs and helimagnetic structures for both Néel-type and Bloch-type configurations. It was shown that the magnitude of the electromotive force in these structures can effectively been controlled by the Rashba coupling. It was also shown that for some special magnetic modulated structures, in which the k-space and real-space Berry curvatures expected to vanish identically, non-vanishing Berry curvatures could be induced by the Rashba coupling.

Meanwhile in the previous studies in this field it was shown that the Rashba coupling strength could be high enough to contribute in the dynamics of the localized magnetization. Then it was shown that giant spin motive force arises due to this type of extrinsic spin orbit coupling when the coupling strength is high [\cite=Giant_Spin_Motive]. In this regime it was assumed that the spin current of the system can modify the magnetization dynamics through the spin transfer torque [\cite=Giant_Spin_Motive]. However it should be noted that this feedback effect is usually very weak and could be ignored at low Rashba coupling regimes. Meanwhile it should noted that according to the Yang approach [\cite=MacDonald] DW motion has nothing to do with the electromotive force and the spin precession is the main factor in this effect. In the present work we have demonstrated that increasing the Rashba coupling strength decreases the precession induced electromotive force of the DW at weak Rashba coupling regime.

It should be considered that, Rashba coupling induced spin dependent electric field depends on the strength of the sd coupling [\cite=Giant_Spin_Motive] [\cite=Tatara_Spin_motive]. It has been verified that the spin dependent electric field at high and low sd couplings have quite different forms. Therefore it could be inferred that the effectiveness of the Rashba coupling in the dynamics of the local magnetization is determined by the sd interaction strengths. In the current manuscript we have assumed weak coupling regime in which the Rashba coupling strengths cannot contribute in the magnetization dynamics. In this case we have demonstrated that unlike the strong coupling regime, increasing the Rashba interaction decreases precession induced electromotive force of the DW.

In the present work two different profiles of magnetic configuration have been considered. First profile corresponds to a DW located between the oppositely directed ferromagnetic regions. The local direction of the magnetization inside the DW varies along the DW width. Second profile corresponds to a commensurate helimagnetic structure in which the magnetic unit cell is integer times of the chemical unit cell. These two profiles have been identified by the functionality of polar angle and azimuthal angles (φ, θ) of the localized spins in the spherical coordinate. Each of these profiles could be either Néel or Bloch type. For two-dimensional structures when the rotation axis of the localized spins is normal to the plane containing the localized dipole atoms the structure known as Néel type magnetic orientation meanwhile when the rotation axis is in the plane of dipole atoms the structure known as Bloch type magnetic orientation. These profiles of the magnetic configurations maybe given by [formula] and φ = const,θ(x) = (πx / am) for Néel-type and Bloch-type helimagnetic configurations respectively. On the other hand Néel-type and Bloch-type DWs could be considered by the following profiles [formula] and φ = const,θ(x) = (π / 2) tanh (x / d) respectively. Here am is the lattice constant of the magnetic unit cell and d is the DW width. These magnetic configurations have been illustrated in Figs. [\ref=DW] and [\ref=heli]. In the current work we have obtained an electromotive force for a DW and a helimagnetic structure in either of Néel or Bloch types of spin orientation. Results show that the electromotive force dependence on the direction of the magnetic field generating the precession and the spin configuration itself.  This paper is organized as follows. In sections II and III we briefly summarize the geometrical Berry approach applied in the present calculation. We review also briefly the recent studies in this research filed. In Sec. IV we obtain the influence of the Rashba interaction on the different Berry curvatures at the static limit. We drive also the effect of the Rashba interaction on the precession induced electromotive force of the magnetic modulated structures in Sec. V. Finally, Sec. VI is devoted to the Results and concluding remarks.

GEOMETRICAL BERRY Approach

The recent applications of Berry curvature in condensed matter physics and observation of elegant conclusions is a motivation for some calculations in DW studies. In 1984 Berry [\cite=berry] pointed out that when the system undergoes an adiabatic change, a phase shift could be generated which may have observable consequences. The system will stay at one of the instantaneous eigenstates if the instantaneous state is well separated with the others and the time evolution is very slow (adiabatic evolution of the system is necessary). The first experimental verification of Berry phase is due to Tomita and Chio [\cite=PhysRevLett.57.937]. A natural place to find the Berry phase is in the spintronics i.e. in the spin transport process. Where numerous researches that related to this topic can be found in literatures [\cite=PhysRevB.62.R6065] [\cite=scince.2001] [\cite=PhysRevLett.87.116801].  Different terms of Berry curvature such as Ωkk, Ωkt, Ωrr, Ωkr and Ωrt provide different types of physical information each of them represents or measures an especial physical effect in condensed matter physics. The k-space Berry curvature, Ωkk, leads to an anomalous velocity which results in modification of the semiclassical equations. The anomalous Hall and spin Hall effects are originated from this anomalous velocity [\cite=Sinitsyn] [\cite=xiao] [\cite=jung] [\cite=cer] [\cite=shi]. When the system depends on certain time varying parameters, Ωkt measures the charge pumping in the system [\cite=PhysRevB.27.6083] [\cite=inga]. As an example, by considering the simplest case of band insulator with a single fully occupied band along the x axis, if some parameters of the system periodically vary in time, then quantized charge can be pumped through the system over one period T, this results in quantization of charge in an integer multiple of first Chern number [\cite=RevModPhys.82.1959]. Bird and et al showed that the Berry phase related to Ωrr, can measure the electron diffraction pattern of deformed crystal [\cite=PhysRevLett.61.2863]. Meanwhile the surface integral of Berry curvature Ωx,y of a vortex, gives a topological invariant known as skyrmion charge [\cite=JETPLETT.22.245]. It was shown that Liouville�s conservation theorem of phase-space volume is violated by Berry curvature considerations in the presence of a magnetic field. This violation results in modification of density of states where Ωkr contributes in determination of this correction [\cite=DiXiao].

MODEL

In the current study the considered system is a magnetic two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) structure which contains one of the two possible types of chiral spin modulated configurations i.e. the DW spin structure or the helimagnetic spin arrangement. The general Hamiltonian which describes the electron inside these type of systems, in the presence of the Rashba coupling, could be expressed as

[formula]

Where

[formula]

in which V(r) is the lattice periodic potential, and the exchange between the localized magnetic moments and the conduction electrons, is expressed as

[formula]

In the above relation, J is the exchange interaction strength, σ denotes the operator of spin in terms of the Pauli spin matrices and the unit vector [formula] is along the direction of local magnetization. The Rashba interaction is given by

[formula]

where α is the Rashba coupling strength.  The Rashba Hamiltonian commutes with the momentum operator and therefore could not be considered as a scattering source in collinear spin structures. However the Rashba interaction could be considered as a spin relaxation mechanism in non-collinear spin configurations and magnetic modulated structures such as DW. It was shown that increasing the Rashba coupling strength could effectively increase the magnetoresistance in sharp DWs [\cite=Mitin].  When an impurity free Hamiltonian is selected to describe the system properties. The DW pinning and magneto-resistive effects of these spin modulated structures have been automatically ignored. However as we will discuss about it later the precession of a pinned DW results in electromotive force in the system.  The Hamiltonian of the system can be expressed in the general form of the two-level systems as follows

[formula]

where we have defined

[formula]

[formula] could be considered as a effective magnetic field of a spin dependent two-level system. Hamiltonian of the system has been given in term of some parameters identified by [formula] in which each of these parameters describing the adiabatic evolution of the system in the parametric space.  The spatial orientation of h() could be a specified by the spherical angles given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

In which in the present case one can obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then the elements of Berry curvature in the parametric space are given by

[formula]

STATIC LIMIT

NÉEL TYPE SPIN CONFIGURATIONS IN THE STATIC LIMIT

At the static limit in the absence of the spin precession (ω  →  0). By considering the effect of the Rashba interaction for a Néel type two-dimensional helimagnetic structure the effective magnetic field of this two band system reads

[formula]

where the spin configuration profile is given by [formula], [formula]. In this case the linear functionality of the polar angle provides a spin-periodic structure i.e. a helimagnetic configuration.  Then one can obtain cos γ = 0. Therefore it can be shown that the Berry curvatures of Néel type Helimagnetic structure vanishes identically:

[formula]

For a Néel type DW in the static limit the orientation profile is as follows: [formula] and [formula]. Where the local direction of the magnetization is given by [formula]. In this case the effective magnetic field is as follows

[formula]

Since hND is identified by the following orientation angles,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similarly it can be easily shown that the Berry curvature of Néel type of DW in the presence of Rashba term, is zero.

[formula]

In the other words the Berry curvature of the Néel type structures in the static limit always vanish. This can be simply obtained if we consider that the Berry curvature of any in plane effective magnetic field where cos γ = 0 vanishes as a result of the Eq. ([\ref=eqomeg]). It should be noted that this result is independent of the spatial functionality of θ and φ which was assumed for each of these angles. Therefore while the effective magnetic field remains in the plane of the two dimensional spin texture the Berry curvature vanishes.

BLOCH TYPE SPIN CONFIGURATIONS IN THE STATIC LIMIT

For a two-dimensional Bloch type helimagnetic spin configuration at the static limit the local direction of the magnetization is given by [formula] where [formula] and [formula], after some calculation the Berry curvature of system can be obtained.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] stands for effective magnetic field for a Bloch type helimagnetic system which is given as follows

[formula]

For a Bloch type magnetic DW the orientation of the local magnetization has been specified by the following profiles of the spherical angles i.e. [formula] and [formula] are the assumptions. The effective magnetic field is

[formula]

so we have

[formula]

[formula]

So the Berry curvatures of the Bloch type of magnetic DW are given as

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Results indicate that the presence of the Rashba coupling has a central role in emergence of the k-space and phase-space Berry curvatures in Bloch type magnetic configurations. It can be easily shown that in the absence of the Rashba coupling these Berry curvatures identically vanish. Meanwhile it should be noted that at a typical fixed point in phase-space Berry curvatures are not monotonic functions of the Rashba coupling strength. Berry curvatures have been suppressed at high Rashba couplings where we have Ωss'  ~  1 / α in which s and s' are ki and rj. Obtained results for the k-space Berry curvature have been summarized in Fig. [\ref=bloch_heli_kxky]. Since the Hall conductivity is given by the following expression

[formula]

Since the k-space Berry curvature decreases by increasing the Rashba coupling strength therefore Hall conductivity should decrease by the Rashba interaction. It can be inferred that the highly contributing states in the Hall conductivity of a helimagnetic structure are located in the region of high wavelength limit. Similar results has been obtained for Bloch-type DW since the behavior of the Ωkx,ky for these type of structures are the same.

PRECESSION INDUCED ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AT LOW MAGNETIC FIELD

In the presence of the magnetic field, local magnetic moments start to precess about the direction of the field. Therefore the orientation of a localized magnetic moment (the local direction of the spin texture: n̂) varies in space and time. This precession characterizes by the Larmor frequency, ωL and n̂m which represents the rotation axis of the precession. In the adiabatic regime when ωL  ≪  lm / vF, where lm is the length scale in which the local magnetization changes and vF is the Fermi velocity of the electrons, the spin of moving electrons will always be directed along the local direction of magnetization i.e. the moving spins obey the local spin direction during their motion. In this case electrons acquire Berry phase induced by localized spins. Provided that the above condition is satisfied one can obtain the space-time Berry curvature, Ωxt, which measures the induced electromotive force per unit length. Space-time Berry curvature (Ωxt) acts on the electrons like an effective electric field. The general formula for electromotive force by means of Berry curvature is defined as

[formula]

The spin precession induced by a normal magnetic field could be expressed by the following profiles for helimagnetic and DW spin configurations.  In these given profiles the magnetic field is assumed to be directed vertically to the two-dimensional plane of the system. For any arbitrary direction of the magnetic field space-time Berry curvature could be obtained by straightforward but somewhat tedious calculations.  It should be noted that DW motion requires that the magnetic field overcome the impurity pinning potential in which the DW has been captured. Pinning of the DW arises due to the impurities and it was demonstrated that the precessing spins of a DW at rest results in effective electromotive force[\cite=MacDonald]. Meanwhile it should be noted that the motion of the Néel type DWs requires an in plane magnetic field greater than the depinning field. As mentioned before it was expected that the DW motion results in electromotive force along the magnetic system. However in the work described in Ref. [\cite=MacDonald] it was shown that the electromotive force generated by the DW is directly proportional to the precession frequency and the DW motion itself has not any contribution in the generated electromotive force. Therefore a pinned DW could also produce electromotive force while the DW is at rest and the local spins are precessing. This effect can take place when the magnetic field is less than the depinning field.  The enlargement of the magnetic domain, in the presence of the parallel magnetic field, manifests itself as motion of domain's boundary i.e. the DW movement. It can be inferred that the motion of the Néel type DWs requires an in plane magnetic field meanwhile the motion of the Bloch type DWs could be generated by a normal field. However low field precession of spins cannot result in domain enlargement or DW motion when the normal magnetic field is less than the the depinning field. It can be simply shown that for both of the Néel type structures i.e. the Néel type DW and the Néel type helimagnetic system, space-time Berry curvature (Ωx,t) vanishes identically. Therefore it could be inferred that the electromotive force vanishes when the direction of precession vector is identical with the rotation angle of the spin texture i.e. when n̂D(r)  ·  n̂m = 1 (or when n̂(r,t)  ·  n̂m = 0) in which n̂D(r,t) denotes the rotation axis of the magnetic modulated structure. In this case the precession cannot induce out of plane spin component and therefore cos (γ) = 0 which indicates that

[formula]

accordingly this results in emf = 0. However it can be easily shown that the space-time Berry curvature does not go all the way to zero for Néel type configurations when the applied magnetic field is not identical with the rotation axis of static spins.  In the presence of a normal field, the precession of the Bloch-type helimagnetic and DW configurations could be given by the following profiles φ  =  ωt,θ(x) = π(x / am) φ  =  ωt,θ(x) = (π / 2) tanh (x / d) respectively. Then for a Bloch type helimagnetic structure the effective magnetic field of the system can be given by the following expression

[formula]

Then one can obtain the space-time Berry curvature as follows Where we have defined

[formula]

Similarly for a Bloch type DW in which space-time distribution of the effective magnetic field could be considered as

[formula]

one can write Eqs. [\ref=O1] and [\ref=O2] indicate that the electromotive force switches off in the absence of the spin precession (ω = 0) in both of the Bloch-type configurations. This means that the rigid DW motion could not generate electromotive force in the system as described in [\cite=MacDonald]. Meanwhile it can be inferred from the Figs [\ref=bloch_heli_EMF] and [\ref=bloch_DW_EMF] that the precession induced electromotive force decreases by increasing the Rashba coupling in the system.  Since the space and time dependence of β and cos γ are just through the spherical angles (θ and φ). If we consider the problem in a general its form, by a simple algebra it can be shown that

[formula]

Therefore electromotive force could not be generated when time and the spatial dependence of the effective field are just appeared in one of the spherical angles. This means that in order to generate an electromotive force by a magnetic structure both of the spin spherical angles (θ and φ) should vary in space and time.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In the current study we have obtained different Berry curvatures of helimagnetic and DW spin structures for Bloch and Néel type configurations. Results show that the Rashba coupling plays a significant role in the Hall conductivity of Bloch-type magnetic configurations. As mentioned before k-space Berry curvature measures the contribution of each k-state in the anomalous velocity. Results show that when all of the local spins are coplanar k-space Berry curvature identically vanishes and there is no contribution into the anomalous velocity and Hall conductivity. Coplanar spins even cannot contribute in the other Berry curvatures and the effects which could be measured by these curves.  As demonstrated in the previous studies in the current work we have shown that the spin precession in a pinned DW or helimagnetic structure generates electromotive force. The electromotive force identically vanishes in the absence of the precession in the other words the precession has been assumed the main factor in the generation of the electromotive force. Meanwhile we have shown that the precession induced electromotive force in Bloch type spin configurations decreases by increasing the Rashba coupling when the Rashba interaction has not considerable contribution in the magnetization dynamics.
