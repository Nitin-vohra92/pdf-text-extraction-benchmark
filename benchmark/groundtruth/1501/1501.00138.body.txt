Generalization of Lambert W-function, Bessel polynomials and transcendental equations

Lambert-like transcendental equation

We consider the following transcendental equation:

[formula]

This transcendental equation emerges in the study of the electron in the potential of [formula]ion (see [\cite=Mezo14]) , and it can be considered a generalization of Lambert W-function defining equation. Indeed, in the limit case -b= l =∞  we obtain:

[formula]

that can be solved by means of Lambert W function:

[formula]

Now we will produce a solution, based on Lagrange inversion series, of equation [\ref=eq1].

We can rewrite such equation as follows:

[formula]

where only trivial algebraic manipulations are employed.

Now, remembering that the solution of the equation :

[formula]

can be written by means of the Lagrange inversion:

[formula]

we obtain a formal series solving equation [\ref=eq1]:

[formula]

Developing the derivative:

[formula]

and remembering that:

[formula]

substituting, we found:

[formula]

[formula]

grouping terms not depending by k to the left of second summation sign:

[formula]

Remembering the definition of Bessel polynomials (see [\cite=Krall49]) :

[formula]

we can rewrite the solution in a more compact form:

[formula]

Symmetrically we can obtain another solution series by swap of parameters a and b:

[formula]

A novel representation for Bessel polynomials

It is interesting to observe that, in the development of above seen calculations, we have encountered a novel representation for Bessel polynomials:

[formula]

The first cases for n=0..5, of the polynomials of type[formula]are:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

whereas the classical Rodrigues representation for Bessel polynomials gives :

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

A direct derivation of the proposed representation of Bessel polynomials in [formula], obtained from the classical Rodrigues formula ([\cite=Krall49]) will be provided in the next section.

Rodrigues formula and transcendental equations

The appearance of orthogonal polynomials (i.e. Bessel polynomials) in solution of above seen transcendental equation is not surprising, indeed remembering the generalized Rodrigues formula ([\cite=Hochstadt]):

[formula]

it can be placed in a form resembling the terms of the Lagrange inversion series, by suitable choose of terms Q and W:

[formula]

when f(x) is a product of suitable rational function and exponential in variable x,

In following subsections, we will examine some examples of interpretation of Lagrange series terms as Rodrigues formulas.

Equation [formula] and Laguerre polynomials

We can remember[\cite=Mezo14] for an employment of Laguerre polynomials for solution of a similar transcendental equation (another generalization of original Lambert W equation):

[formula]

which can be formally solved by:

[formula]

where L (x) denotes the generalized Laguerre polynomials (in[\cite=Mezo14], an equivalent formula based on first derivative of Laguerre polynomials was found).

In the mentioned paper an non-trivial induction proof was given, but a more straightforward derivation can be obtained if we recognize that the above equation can be rewritten as:

[formula]

that can be solved by Lagrange inversion, obtaining for n-th term in the series (having placed: [formula]):

[formula]

remembering the definition of Laguerre polynomials, the equation ([\ref=eq:laguerre_series]) follows.

Equation x = a + le- x2 / 2and Hermite polynomials

The equation:

[formula]

leads to Lagrange term :

[formula]

remembering Rodrigues formula for Hermite polynomial (see [\cite=Hochstadt]):

[formula]

we can rewrite the Lagrange series term ([\ref=eq:risolvente_hermite]) by means of Rodrigues formula as:

[formula]

therefore the complete solution of equation ([\ref=eq:equazione_hermite]):

[formula]

Equation x = a + leexand Touchard polynomials

The equation:

[formula]

leads to Lagrange term:

[formula]

remembering Rodrigues formula for Touchard polynomials:

[formula]

therefore:

[formula]

and the formal solution of ([\ref=eq:equazione_touchard]):

[formula]

Equation [formula]and Bessel polynomials

The Bessel polynomials can be generated by the following Rodrigues formula (see[\cite=Krall49]):

[formula]

An employment the Rodrigues formula for Bessel polynomials for solving seems natural:

[formula]

therefore the formal n-th term in the Lagrange solution series is:

[formula]

that can be formally written in terms of Bessel polynomials as follows:[formula]. Therefore the complete solution of equation [\ref=eq:equazione_reciproca] becomes:

[formula]

For the case in study equation ([\ref=eq1]), we have to place:

[formula]

Equation (x - a)(x - b) = lexand Bessel polynomials in novel Rodrigues-like form

In previous section, starting from Lagrange series, we have found a novel Rodrigues-like representation of Bessel polynomials:

[formula]

We now will provide an alternative proof; starting from the equation (6) we change x->2/x:

[formula]

[formula]

Now we will make use of the following identity (we will provide a proof in the next section):

[formula]

so we can rewrite equation ([\ref=eq:reciproco_deriv]):

[formula]

that matches ([\ref=eq:novel]), after rescaling x  →  x / n.

Proof of identity [formula] by induction

Now we will provide a proof for identity :

[formula]

where we have placed: [formula]in order to save space.

We start observing that, for n=1 the following is trivial that:

[formula]

Therefore for n=1 the identity holds. For induction we proof that, if the identity holds for n, then it holds also for n+1. Applying the operator[formula]

to both members of ([\ref=eq:differential]):

[formula]

[formula]

remembering the following commutation rules:

[formula]

[formula]

we can write:

[formula]

[formula]

Now we can show that the term in square parentheses is null, indeed applying above seen commutation rules:

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore:

[formula]

Concluding remarks

Employing the Lagrange inverting series, a solution of the transcendental equation (x - a)(x - b) = lex(that can be considered a quadratic generalization of the equation defining Lambert W-function) has been found in terms of Bessel orthogonal polynomials.

Once again (see [\cite=Mezo14]), a transcendental equation can be formally solved by means of classic orthogonal polynomials, suggesting a link between Rodrigues formulas and the terms of Lagrange series. Moreover a novel representation for Bessel polynomials [formula]is shown. Finally, an interesting and previously unknown differential identity [formula] for the reciprocal differentiation has been found.

Further investigations on radius of convergence and numerical feasibility of above seen series (possibly by series acceleration techniques) are required.

Moreover the occurrence of classical orthogonal polynomials in solution of mixed exponential/polynomial transcendental equations suggests to investigate for more general series of hypergeometric functions generated by Lagrange inversion of transcendental equations.
