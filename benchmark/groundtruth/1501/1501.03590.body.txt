Evolution of Goldstone mode in binary condensate mixtures

S. Gautam D. Angom

Introduction

Two-species Bose-Einstein condensates (TBECs) are uniquely different from the single-species BEC as they can be either in miscible or immiscible phase depending upon the interaction strengths [\cite=ho_96]. It is, however, possible to tune a TBEC from miscible to immiscible domain or vice-versa in experiments [\cite=tojo_10] through Feshbach resonance. In the last decade or so, TBECs have been realized experimentally in mixtures of two different alkali atoms  [\cite=mccarron_11] [\cite=pasquiou_13], or two different isotopes  [\cite=inouye_98] and hyperfine states  [\cite=stamper_kurn_98]. Such an unprecedented control over experiments has motivated numerous theoretical investigations on the stationary states  [\cite=gautam-10] [\cite=gautam-11], dynamical instabilities  [\cite=sasaki_09] [\cite=gautam_10] and collective excitations  [\cite=stringari_96] [\cite=ticknor_14] of TBECs.

The present work describes the development of a gapless [\cite=hugenholtz_59] Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with Popov (HFB-Popov) approximation [\cite=griffin_96] for TBECs. We apply it to examine the spectra of the quasi-particle excitations of trapped TBEC in separated and non-separated trap centers. In the first part of the work we study the hardening of the Goldstone mode with the increase in the separation of the trap centers in which the TBECs have been confined. This has profound experimental implications since, in experiments, the trap centers never coincide. This is due to gravitational sagging, and deviations of the trapping potentials from perfect alignment. In the later part of our study, we show the softening of Goldstone mode with the variation in inter-species interaction strengths, albeit, with co-incident trap centers. Previous studies have shown the existence of an additional Goldstone mode in the excitation spectrum at phase-separation for the transition from miscible to symmetry-broken or side-by-side density profiles of TBEC  [\cite=ticknor_14] [\cite=ticknor_13] [\cite=takeuchi_13]. We, here, show that in the the changeover from miscible to sandwich type density profile, where one of the species is enveloped by the other, is accompanied by the appearance of a third Goldstone mode at the transition point. Even at higher inter-species interactions, the mode continues to be a Goldstone mode.

Theory of two component BEC

To provide a coherent description of the HFB-Popov theory for a quasi-1D TBEC, we start with the theory for a single-species BEC. In a cigar-shaped harmonic trap for which the radial frequency [formula] the axial frequency ωz, the time-independent 1D generalized GP equation with the HFB-Popov approximation is given by [\cite=griffin_96]

[formula]

where   =  ( - 2 / 2m)∂2  /  ∂z2  +  V(z) - μ. The strength of the repulsive contact interaction is represented by U  =  (aλ) / m with a as the s-wave scattering length, and [formula] quantifies the anisotropy of the trapping potential. The atomic mass of the species is given by m, and μ is the chemical potential. The quantities [formula], [formula], and n(z)  =  nc(z) + ñ(z) in the above equation represent the condensate, non-condensate, and total density, respectively along the axial direction of the trap. In the equation φ(z) is the order parameter and ψ̃(z) is the field operator associated with the fluctuation. The non-condensate or thermal component ñ(z) is computed from the solutions of the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations

[formula]

Here uj's and vj's are the Bogoliubov quasi-particle amplitudes, and Ejs are the eigen energy of the jth quasi-particle excitation. Applying the same formalism, the ground state of a quasi-1D TBEC is described by a pair of coupled generalized GP equations [\cite=roy_14],

[formula]

Here k  =  ( - 2 / 2mk)∂2  /  ∂z2  +  Vk(z) - μk and k = 1,2 is the species index. The quantities Ukk  =  (akkλ) / mk and U12 = (a12λ) / (2m12), are the intra- and inter-species interactions, respectively, with m12 = m1m2 / (m1 + m2) as the reduced mass. For the present study, we consider repulsive interactions, that is akk,a12  >  0. The φks are the order parameters with [formula], [formula], and nk(z)  =  nck(z) + ñk(z) as the local condensate, non-condensate, and total density, respectively of the kth species. Like in single species case, let ψ̃k(z)s represent the fluctuations, then, the non-condensate density ñk(z) is obtained from the solutions of the coupled Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and k  =    -  k. Here uks and vks are the Bogoliubov quasi-particle amplitudes, and j is the energy eigenvalue index. Taking the quantum fluctuations into account, the order parameters φks are calculated self-consistently using Eqns. [\ref=gpe], [\ref=bdg] as elaborated in Ref. [\cite=roy_14]. In the present study, we examine the ground state of the TBEC and compute the energy eigenmodes at zero temperature both in miscible ([formula]) and immiscible ([formula]) regimes with co-incident and non co-incident trap centers.

Results and Discussions

Mode hardening in 87Rb-23Na TBEC at T = 0 due to displaced trap centers

In experiments, the gravitational potential of Earth and tilts in the external trapping potentials displace the minima of the traps. The potentials are no longer co-incident and can be replaced by the following effective potentials

[formula]

where 2z0 is the separation between two trap centers, and the other symbols have their usual meaning. It is, therefore, pertinent to examine the variation of energies of the quasi-particle excitations and the topological deformation of the density profiles with the change in the separation of the trap centers. For our present study, we consider a quasi-1D Rb-Na mixture in the immiscible regime with ωz(Rb)  =  2π  ×  4.55Hz, ωz(Na)  =  2π  ×  3.89Hz and [formula]Hz, [formula]Hz and NNa  =  NRb = 104. Let Rb and Na be the first and second species, respectively with a11 = aRbRb  =  100a0, a22  =  aNaNa = 50a0, and a12 = aNaRb  =  100a0 where a0 is the Bohr radius. When the trap centers are co-incident, that is, z0 = 0, the spectra is characterized by three Goldstone modes. The condensate density profile assumes a sandwich geometry, in which Rb condensate is at the center and flanked by Na condensate at the edges.

For z0 > 0, separated trap centers, with the breaking of the z-parity of the system, the energy of the second Goldstone mode of the Na condensate gradually increases and gets hardened at a critical value of z0. The Na Kohn mode which is transformed into the third Goldstone mode of the system, second for the Na condensate, at phase separation with z = 0, regains energy when z0 > 0 to emerge as the second Kohn mode of the system. This is evident from the mode evolution as shown as a function of z0 in Figs. [\ref=mode_evol_delta](a), and the profile of the hardened mode mode is shown in Fig. [\ref=efunction]. The energy of the Rb Kohn mode, on the other hand, remains unchanged even in a separated trap setting. Furthermore, with the change from co-incident to non con-incident trap center, the sandwich type density profile gradually changes into a side-by-side density profile. The excitation spectra of the system is now identified by two Goldstone modes and two Kohn modes. It is to be recalled here that, throughout the transition, the TBECs are always phase separated. It must, however, be emphasized that the evolution of the Goldstone mode when the TBEC undergoes a transition from miscible to immiscible with z0 = 0 is different from the current case. We reported this in our previous work [\cite=roy_14] for Rb-Cs TBEC, and in the present work we discuss the same for the Rb-Na in the following section.

Third Goldstone mode in 87Rb-23Na TBEC at T = 0

The transition from miscible to immiscible phases in TBECs occurs when [formula]. For the Rb-Na TBEC, experimentally, it is possible to steer the system from miscible to immiscible domain through the Rb-Na Feshbach resonance [\cite=wang_13]. This motivates us to examine the variation of eigenenergies Ejs of the quasi-particle excitations at, and around the point of phase separation. We thus vary aNaRb in the domain [formula] to study the role of inter-species interactions in the Rb-Na TBEC, more precisely, the effect on the excitation spectra. In the absence of inter-species interactions, that is aNaRb = 0, the excitation spectrum has two Goldstone modes, and two Kohn modes with eigen energies ωz(Rb) and 0.85ωz(Rb) for Rb and Na species, respectively. Further more, the modes of the two species are distinct and uncoupled.

For aNaRb  >  0, the eigen spectra of the two species are not independent, and as a result the modes intermix. The energy of the Rb Kohn mode remains unchanged with the variation in aNaRb. The energy of the Na Kohn mode, however, decreases with the increase of aNaRb, and goes soft at a critical value of aNaRb when the phase-separation occurs. This generates a new Goldstone mode of the Na BEC in the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum as shown in Fig.[\ref=mode_evol_delta](b). This happens because at phase-separation, the miscible density profiles transform to sandwich type density profiles, with the 87Rb condensate located at the center and 23Na condensate at the edges. Thus, effectively the Na condensate consist of two topologically disconnected BECs and there are two Goldstone modes with the same |uNa| and |vNa|, but different phases [\cite=roy_14]. For the other case, transition from miscible to side-by -side density profiles, the Kohn mode energy of one of the species decreases, and goes soft at phase-separation. This breaks the z-parity symmetry of the system, and the zero-energy mode then starts to regain energy after phase-separation [\cite=ticknor_13]. Detailed discussions on Goldstone modes and bifurcations in TBECs with or without soliton are discussed in our previous works[\cite=roy_14] [\cite=roy_14a].

Conclusions

The third Goldstone mode in TBECs with sandwich profile at phase separation gets harden when the trap centers are separated by a critical distance. This is accompanied by the topological change from sandwich to side-by-side condensate density profiles. This result has important experimental implications, and demonstrates why it is a major challenge to obtain sandwich type density profiles in TBEC experiments. The appearance of a third Goldstone mode in TBECs with sandwich type density profile at phase-separation in Rb-Na is another finding, which confirms and adds to the similar result reported in our previous work [\cite=roy_14]. This Goldstone mode is associated with the fragmentation of the condensate species at the edges, Na in the present work, into two distinct condensates. So, effectively, the TBEC at phase separation with sandwich geometry, in quasi-1D, is equivalent to three coupled condensate clouds, and thus three Goldstone modes emerge in the excitation spectrum.
