A Note on a Question of Erds & Graham

Introduction

In [\cite=Schur], Schur shows that for any finite coloring of the positive integers (a function [formula]), there will be a triple (x,y,z) such that x + y = z and χ(x) = χ(y) = χ(z). This triple is said to be a monochromatic solution to the equation x + y = z. The least N such that this statement holds for any coloring [formula] is called the r-color Schur number and is denoted S(r).

It is easy to see that S(2) = 5, and one might note trivially that S(1) = 2. The values of S(3) and S(4) are also known. We can associate such a quantity to any equation E, not just x + y = z, which denote [formula]. In cases where no such N exists, we say [formula]. An equation E is called r-regular if the quantity [formula] is finite, and it is called regular if it is r-regular for all r.

In [\cite=Rado], Rado provides necessary and sufficient conditions for linear, homogeneous equations to be regular. He also gives necessary and sufficient conditions (essentially non-triviality) for such equations to be 2-regular. For that reason, we call these quantities "Rado numbers." There have been many papers, starting with [\cite=BB82], giving certain Rado numbers (often parametrized families of equations). In most cases the equations are linear and there are 2 colors.

In this note, we state three results from a forthcoming paper [\cite=MP14] that do not fall into these categories. The equations are quadratic, and in one case, the number of colors is 3.

In [\cite=EG80], Erds and Graham ask whether the equation x2 + y2 = z2 is 2-regular. In [\cite=Gra08], Graham notes that it is not clear which answer is correct. In [\cite=FH13] it is proved that 9x2 + 16y2 = n2 (along with a family of similar quadratic equations) is 2-regular, but only x and y are supposed to be monochromatic (note n). We offer the following three results, which have been a part of ongoing work to settle the question:

[formula].

[formula].

[formula].

In the third of these results, we do not exclude the possibility that it is infinite.

These results are all obtained computationally and will be detailed in [\cite=MP14]. The first result also inspires a new sequence representing the Rado number for the equation [formula], which is tabulated as follows:
