Introduction

Solution of the inverse scattering problem for XXZ Heisenberg spin-1 / 2 chain in the pioneering paper [\cite=KMT99] opened a possibility to apply the results of calculations of the Bethe vectors scalar products [\cite=Sl89] to the problem of calculation of the correlation functions for some class of quantum integrable models (see review [\cite=Sl07] and references therein). This class of integrable models is characterized by the property that the monodromy operator is constructed from the R-matrix and it becomes a permutation operator at some value of the spectral parameter.

For quantum models where such property is absent there exists another method to calculate the correlation functions of the local operators [\cite=IzK84]. The main idea of this method is to divide artificially the interval where model is defined into two sub-intervals. In this framework one has a possibility to study form factors of operators depending on an internal point of the original interval. This approach was used to analyze some correlation functions in the bose gas model that describes one-dimensional bosons with δ-function interaction [\cite=IzKR87] [\cite=KitKMST07]. The authors of [\cite=IzK84] called such the model two-site generalized model. Later, in [\cite=Sl07] the terminology two-component model was used. We think that both terms might be misleading: the first one if we apply this approach to the study of lattice models (like spin chains, where 'site' has already a definite and different meaning); the second if we use such model for the description of multi-component gases, where 'component' refers to the different types of particles. Therefore in this paper we call this model a composite model.

In the composite model the total monodromy matrix T(u) is presented as a usual matrix product of the partial monodromy matrices T(2)(u) and T(1)(u): The matrix elements of T(u) are operators in the space of states V that corresponds to an interval

[formula]

and ]x,L] respectively. Here x is an intermediate point of the interval

Coproduct property of Bethe vectors

The quantum integrable models considered in this paper are related to the quantum GL(3)-invariant R-matrix where [formula] is a permutation operator of two three-dimensional spaces [formula] and c is a constant. The total monodromy matrix T(u) satisfies the RTT algebra Every partial monodromy matrix [formula] also satisfies the RTT-relation [\eqref=RTT-al] with R-matrix [\eqref=R-mat]. Matrix elements of the monodromy are introduced by the sum [formula], where [formula] are the matrix units with 1 at the intersection of ith row and jth column and zero elsewhere. In terms of the matrix units R-matrix [\eqref=R-mat] has the form

Instead of the functions λi(u), λ(1)i(u) and λ(2)i(u) defined by [\eqref=vac-vec] we will use their ratios It is obvious from equation [\eqref=T-TT] and definition [\eqref=vac-vec] of the vacuum vectors that

In this paper we use the same notation and conventions as in [\cite=BPRS-BV-12]. Besides the rational function g(x,y) we also use another rational function

We denote sets of variables by bar: ū, [formula] and so on. We also consider partitions of sets into disjoint subsets and denote them by symbol ⇒  . For example, the notation [formula] means that the set ū is divided into two disjoint subsets [formula] and [formula], such that [formula] and [formula]. Special notation ū0, k and so on is used for the sets [formula], [formula] etc.

In order to avoid excessively cumbersome formulas we use shorthand notation for products of commuting operators Tij(u) or the vacuum eigenvalues λi(u) or rk(u) (partial and total). Namely, whenever such an operator (or a function) depends on a set of variables, this means that we deal with the product of these operators (functions) with respect to the corresponding set, as follows: This notation is also used for products of the functions f(x,y) and g(x,y),

Bethe vectors

Bethe vectors of GL(3)-invariant models depend on two sets of Bethe parameters: [formula], where [formula], [formula], [formula]. Several explicit representations for Bethe vectors were found in [\cite=BPRS-BV-12]. We present here one of them using the shorthand notation introduced in [\eqref=SH-prod], [\eqref=exam] Here the sum is taken over partitions of the sets [formula] and [formula]. The partitions are independent except the condition [formula], where [formula]. The function [formula] is a partition function of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions [\cite=Kor82]. It has the following explicit representation [\cite=Ize87]:

Partial Bethe vectors [formula] are given by the same formula [\eqref=BV-explicit], where one should replace all Tij by [formula], all λ2 by [formula], and |0〉 by [formula], [formula]. In order to express the total Bethe vector in terms of matrix elements [formula] acting on [formula] one should substitute [\eqref=T-TT] for every Tij and [\eqref=lr] for all λ2 into equation [\eqref=BV-explicit]. It is a highly nontrivial fact that the result of this substitution can be reduced to a bilinear combination of partial Bethe vectors.

We denote dual Bethe vectors by [formula]. They are given by a formula similar to [\eqref=BV-explicit] Here the notation is the same as in [\eqref=BV-explicit]. In order to obtain partial dual Bethe vectors one should make the replacements already mentioned, namely [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Morphisms of the algebra and relations between Bethe vectors

The R-matrix [\eqref=R-mat] is invariant under simultaneous transpositions in both auxiliary spaces. This fact implies the existence of two symmetries in the algebra of the monodromy matrix elements. The mapping defines an antimorphism of the algebra [\eqref=RTT-al], while the mapping defines an isomorphism of the algebra [\eqref=RTT-al].

Assuming that we obtain from the mappings [\eqref=psi-m] and [\eqref=phi-m] the following relations between different Bethe vectors [\cite=BPRS-BV-12] and

Moreover the mappings [\eqref=psi-m] and [\eqref=phi-m] intertwine the coproduct [\eqref=uni-copro] and inverse coproduct Namely For example, the first intertwining relation follows from the chain of equalities The second property in [\eqref=int-psi-phi] can be proved in the same way. Thus, we see that the action of the mappings ψ and φ exchanges the components in the tensor product.

Main statement

The Bethe vectors of the total monodromy matrix T(u) can be presented as a bilinear combination of partial Bethe vectors as follows: Here the sums are taken over all the partitions [formula] and [formula]. The integers [formula] and [formula] [formula] are the cardinalities of the corresponding subsets. Hereby, a1 + a2 = a and b1 + b2 = b.

We use an induction over a. First, for arbitrary [formula] we define a vector [formula] as follows: When a = 0 and b is arbitrary, we obtain This is a known formula for the Bethe vector in the composite model in the GL(2) case [\cite=IzK84]. Thus, we conclude that [formula].

Then we consider the action of the operators T13(z) and T12(z) onto this vector. The goal is to prove that and where the sum is taken over partitions [formula] with #  v0 = 1 (recall that due to our convention [formula]).

If these actions are proved, then we obtain a recursion Since this recursion coincides with the one for the Bethe vectors (see, e.g., [\cite=BPRS-BV-12]), and using the equality proven above for a = 0, we conclude that Ba,b is a Bethe vector [formula]. Thus, the proof of Theorem [\ref=main-theor] reduces to proving equations [\eqref=act-T13] and [\eqref=act-T12]: it is done in Sections [\ref=T13] and [\ref=T12].

Dual Bethe vectors of the total monodromy matrix T(u) can be presented as a bilinear combination of dual partial Bethe vectors as follows: Here the sums are taken over partitions [formula] and [formula]. The integers [formula] and [formula] [formula] are the cardinalities of the corresponding subsets. Hereby, a1 + a2 = a and b1 + b2 = b.

Using [\eqref=psi-BV] we act with the antimorphism ψ on [\eqref=BV-BV]. Since the action of ψ exchanges the components of the tensor product, we should replace in the r.h.s. the vector [formula] by [formula] and the vector [formula] by [formula]. The subtlety is that we also should make the replacement of the functions [formula]. This can be easily understood if we remember the origin of these functions in [\eqref=BV-BV]. Due to [\eqref=BV-explicit] total Bethe vectors are polynomials in operators Tij with i < j acting on the vacuum vector which implies Therefore, in spite of the total Bethe vector depends only on Tij with i < j, it depends on the partial [formula] with i = j as well. It is the action of these operators on the vacuum vector that produces the functions [formula]. But since the action of ψ exchanges the components of the tensor product, we obtain that T(1)ii  ↔  T(2)ii, and hence, r(1)i  ↔  r(2)i. Thus, we obtain It remains to relabel the subsets [formula], [formula] and the subscripts of the partial dual Bethe vectors a1  ↔  a2, b1  ↔  b2, and we arrive at [\eqref=BV-BV-du].

Action of [formula]

In order to study the action of the operators T12(u) and T13(u) onto partial Bethe vectors we use [\eqref=T-TT] and present these operators in the form

Let [formula] and [formula]. Then due to [\eqref=act-T13] we should prove that Due to [\eqref=New-BV] a vector [formula] has the form

We have omitted the subscripts of the partial Bethe vectors in the r.h.s. of [\eqref=NBV], because in this case they do not give any additional information. Indeed, the subscripts of partial Bethe vectors are equal to the cardinalities of the subsets of Bethe parameters. Since in [\eqref=NBV], the sum over partitions is taken over all possible subsets, it is clear that the corresponding cardinalities run through all possible values from 0 to a for the subsets of ū and from 0 to b for the subsets of [formula]. Therefore below we shall omit the subscripts of the partial Bethe vectors in the sums over partitions.

Consider how the parameter z may enter the subsets of [formula] and [formula]. Obviously, there are three cases in the r.h.s.: The case [formula] and [formula] gives vanishing contribution, because the product [formula] contains the factor f(z,z)- 1 = 0. Thus, we obtain where

Consider now the action of the operator T13(z) onto the vector [formula] in the l.h.s. of [\eqref=act-T13z]. Due to [\eqref=T12T13] we have Substituting here [\eqref=New-BV] for [formula] we find where

Using formulas for the action of the monodromy matrix elements onto Bethe vectors (see Appendix [\ref=Action]) we can find the terms Ck explicitly.

Due to [\eqref=A-13] and [\eqref=A-11] we have Here the original sets of the Bethe parameters are divided into subsets [formula] and [formula]. Then in some terms the subsets [formula] and [formula] are divided into additional subsets [formula] and [formula] with #  ui  =    #  vi = 1 (for this reason we do not write bar for ui and vi). The sum is taken over all partitions described above.

Similarly, due to [\eqref=A-13], [\eqref=A-12], [\eqref=A-23], and [\eqref=A-33] we obtain and

Looking at [\eqref=C1] we see that the sum over partitions involving the product of Bethe vectors [formula] coincides with the term A1 [\eqref=A1]. Similarly, the sum in [\eqref=C2] involving the product [formula] coincides with A3 [\eqref=A3], while the sum in [\eqref=C3] involving the product [formula] coincides with A2 [\eqref=A2]. Thus, equation [\eqref=act-T13] will be proved if we show that contributions from other terms in [\eqref=C1]-[\eqref=C3] vanish. To observe these cancellations we combine together the terms where the Bethe vectors [formula] and [formula] depend on the parameter z in the same manner.

There are two terms containing the product of the following type: Here ū', ū'' and [formula], [formula] are arbitrary subsets of the sets ū and [formula] respectively. The first term of this type comes from [\eqref=C1] The second term is contained in [\eqref=C2]: We claim that C12 + C22 = 0. For this purpose we relabel the subsets in equation [\eqref=1-type-2], so that the vectors in [\eqref=1-type-1] and [\eqref=1-type-2] to have the same arguments. Observe that such the replacement is nothing but the change of summation variables. Clearly, we should make the following relabeling: first [formula] and then [formula] Then we obtain We see that C12 + C22 = 0 due to the trivial identity

The analysis of other contributions can be done in the similar manner. There are two terms containing the sums over partitions involving the products of the Bethe vectors of the form It is easy to check that after appropriate relabeling of the subsets they also cancel each other due to identity [\eqref=1-t-id].

Finally, all three terms [\eqref=C1]-[\eqref=C3] contain the sums over partitions involving the products of the Bethe vectors of the form Mutual cancellation of these terms is a bit more subtle. These contributions are One should again relabel the subsets in such a way that the Bethe vectors in all three terms have the same arguments. For this we relabel in C24 [formula] and then [formula]. In C33 we make the following replacements: [formula], [formula] and then [formula], [formula]. After the relabeling described above we obtain that C13 + C24 + C33 = 0 due to identity Thus, equation [\eqref=act-T13] is proved.

Action of [formula]

The action of the operator T12(z) on [formula] can be studied in the similar manner, but it is more cumbersome. Therefore in this section we describe only the main steps, while the details are given in Appendix [\ref=Vanish].

Let again [formula], [formula] with cardinalities #  ū = a - 1 and [formula]. Consider a linear combination where the sum is taken over partitions [formula] with #  ξ0 = 1. It is easy to see that this linear combination coincides with the r.h.s. of [\eqref=act-T12]. Indeed, at ξ0 = z [\eqref=lin-comb] yields the first term in [\eqref=act-T12], and if ξ0 = v0, then [\eqref=lin-comb] yields the second term. Due to the definition [formula] we have where the sum is taken over partitions [formula] and [formula] with #  ξ0 = 1. As before, we do not write the subscripts for the Bethe vectors [formula]. Consider again how the parameter z may enter the subsets in [\eqref=LC-BV]. This time, there are five cases: In all these five cases we have different contributions to the linear combination D. So, we have where and In all these formulas the set ū is divided into subsets [formula]. As for the set [formula], it is divided either into subsets [formula] (like in [\eqref=D1], [\eqref=D3]), or into subsets [formula] with #  v0 = 1 (like in [\eqref=D2], [\eqref=D4], [\eqref=D5]).

We should compare these contributions with the l.h.s. of [\eqref=act-T12]. There we have Thus, we obtain where for k = 1,2,3 Using again the formulas of Appendix [\ref=Action] we obtain explicit expressions for the terms Ek. They are given in Appendix [\ref=Vanish]. Then similarly to the case considered in the previous section we should compare coefficients of the products of the partial Bethe vectors of different type (depending on how the parameter z enters the arguments of Bethe vectors). One can show that five terms in the combination E1 + E2 + E3 reproduce the sum [\eqref=D-D5], while other contributions mutually cancel each other. In this way we arrive at equation [\eqref=act-T12].

As we have explained in Section [\ref=SS-MS] the actions [\eqref=act-T13] and [\eqref=act-T12] imply the recursion [\eqref=recursion]. Since this recursion coincides with the one for the Bethe vectors [\cite=BPRS-BV-12], we conclude that [formula] [\eqref=New-BV] is the Bethe vector [formula].

Coproduct property for Bethe vectors in [formula]-based models

In this section we use the results obtained in [\cite=BeKhP07] [\cite=KhP08] adapted to the case under consideration.

Let Π be a set [formula] of indices of simple positive roots of [formula]. Let [formula] be a finite collection of positive integers. We attach to each multiset I an ordered set of variables [formula] with a 'coloring' map ι:I  →  Π. For any multiset I we assume a natural linear ordering in the set of variables I Each variable tik has its own 'type': ι(tik)∈Π. We call such set of variables I an ordered Π-multiset.

For example, for the GL(3)-based models, the multiset is used to parameterize the sets ū and [formula] of the Bethe parameters for the Bethe vectors [formula] and the corresponding ordering in the set I  =  {ū,} is

Given elements ti,tj of some ordered Π-multiset define two functions γ(ti,tj) and β(ti,tj) by the formulas

Let [formula] be a tensor product of two representations with vacuum vectors |0〉(1), |0〉(2) and weight series {λ(1)b(u)} and {λ(2)b(u)}, [formula].

A collection of rational V-valued functions [formula], depending on the representation V with a weight vacuum vector |0〉, and an ordered Π-multiset I, is called a modified weight function [formula] (it is the same as Bethe vectors up to normalization), if the following relations are satisfied

[formula]

and where

The summation in ([\ref=weight22]) runs over all possible decompositions of the multiset I into a disjoint union of two non-intersecting multisubsets I  ⇒  {I1,I2}. The structure of ordered Π-multiset on each multisubset is induced from that of I.

For example, in the GL(3)-based model the decomposition of the multiset I [\eqref=setI] into two non-intersecting multisubsets I1 and I2 corresponds to the decompositions of the sets ū and [formula] into two pairs of the subsets with the mutual ordering inherited by the ordering [\eqref=ord1]. So the multiset I1 is such that [formula] and the corresponding to the multiset I2 is a subset of variables [formula].

The function ΦI1,I2(ti|i∈I) in this case is and the formula [\eqref=weight22] becomes where the sum is taken over the partitions [\eqref=uv-sub].

Define now the normalization of the Bethe vectors that we used for the GL(3)-based models in [\cite=BPRS-BV-12] Then, taking into account the coproduct property of the diagonal monodromy matrix elements [\eqref=lr] we recast [\eqref=w22bis] as Under identification [\eqref=normal] this relation coincides with the statement of the Theorem [\ref=main-theor].

Conclusion

A composite model allows one to apply the algebraic Bethe ansatz to the study of operators depending on an internal point of the original interval. In particular, one can compute form factors of these operators and then use the results obtained for calculating correlation functions. A formula for the Bethe vector is a necessary tool of this program.

In this paper we obtained an explicit expression for the Bethe vectors in the composite quantum integrable model associated with GL(3)-invariant R-matrix [\eqref=R-mat]. We did it in two ways. The first one is based on the action of the monodromy matrix elements onto Bethe vectors obtained in [\cite=BPRS-BV-12]. The second way is based on the coproduct property of the weight functions proved by the completely different methods in [\cite=TV95]. Thus, we have shown that the formula that relates Bethe vector of the composite model with the partial Bethe vectors is equivalent to the coproduct property.

The next step of the program is to use the formulas for the Bethe vectors in the composite model for calculating form factors of the entries of the partial monodromy matrices [formula]. This will be the subject of our further publication [\cite=PRS-FFLO]. There we consider form factors of zero modes [\cite=PakRS15a] of the operators [formula]. We show that they can be reduced to the form factors of total monodromy matrix entries Tij. In this way we obtain determinant representations for form factors of local operators in GL(3)-invariant models.

Formulas of the monodromy matrix elements action onto Bethe vectors

We give here a list of formulas of the action of Tij(z) on Bethe vectors. These formulas were obtained in the paper [\cite=BPRS-BV-12] for the more general situation of multiple action of the monodromy matrix elements onto Bethe vectors. In [\cite=BPRS-BV-12] these formulas were proved by induction and using the explicit formulas for the Bethe vectors [\eqref=BV-explicit].

Formulas for the actions of the partial [formula] on partial Bethe vectors [formula] are the same up to the replacements of λ2 and rk by [formula] and [formula] respectively. All formulas (except [\eqref=A-13]) are given in terms of sums over partitions of the original sets of the Bethe parameters into subsets. In all the formulas #  u0  =    #  v0 = 1, and we recall that [formula] and [formula].

Action of T13(z):

Action of T12(z):

Action of T23(z):

Action of T11(z):

Action of T22(z):

Action of T33(z):

Action of T32(z): In this formula #  v0  =    #  v1  =    #  u0 = 1.

Proof of the equality ([\ref=act-T12])

In this appendix we give explicit formulas for the terms Ek in [\eqref=act-T12NBV-3t]. It is clear from the formulas of Appendix [\ref=Action] that E1, E2 and E3 respectively consist of six, eight and five different sums over partitions. We denote them as E1,m, [formula], E2,m, [formula], and E3,m, [formula]. Each of these contributions can be presented in the form where γk,m may contain additional sums over partitions.

Due to [\eqref=A-12] and [\eqref=A-11] we have for the term E1:

Due to [\eqref=A-22] and [\eqref=A-12] we have for the term E2:

Due to [\eqref=A-32] and [\eqref=A-13] we have for the term E3:

First of all one can easily observe that contributions γ1,1 [\eqref=C11] and γ2,1 [\eqref=C21] into the sum [\eqref=act-T12NBV-3t] coincide identically with the contributions D1 [\eqref=D1] and D3 [\eqref=D3] into the first sum of [\eqref=D-D5]. The contributions γ1,4 [\eqref=C14], γ2,2 [\eqref=C22] and γ3,2 [\eqref=C32] coincide with the contributions D2 [\eqref=D2], D4 [\eqref=D4] and D5 [\eqref=D5] into the second sum of [\eqref=D-D5] up to a relabeling of the subsets. Indeed, consider, for example, the contribution E1,4. Combining [\eqref=G-g] and [\eqref=C14] we obtain Relabeling of the subsets viii  →  v0 and [formula] leads to which exactly coincides with the sum over partitions [\eqref=D-D5] of the contribution D2. The identifications of the contributions E2,2 and E3,2 with the terms D4 and D5 in [\eqref=D-D5] can be done similarly.

All other contributions should vanish. To check this we follow the same strategy as in Section [\ref=T13]. We consider separately the coefficients of the products of the Bethe vectors [formula] with a different placement of the parameter z. There are six different types of these products:

Coefficients of [formula] come from [\eqref=C12] and [\eqref=C23].

Coefficients of [formula] come from [\eqref=C25] and [\eqref=C33].

Coefficients of [formula] come from [\eqref=C15] and [\eqref=C24].

Coefficients of [formula] come from [\eqref=C26] and [\eqref=C34].

In all these four cases the cancellations of the coefficients after relabeling the subsets occurs due to the identity [\eqref=1-t-id].

Coefficients of [formula] come from [\eqref=C13], [\eqref=C27] and [\eqref=C31]. After proper relabeling the subsets they cancel each other due to the identity [\eqref=3-t-id].

Finally, the coefficients of [formula] come from [\eqref=C16], [\eqref=C28] and [\eqref=C35]. In this case again after relabeling the subsets they vanish due to the identity [\eqref=3-t-id].
