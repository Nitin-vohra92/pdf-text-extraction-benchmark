The local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for U(3)  ×  U(2) : the non-generic case

Introduction

Let E / F be a quadratic extension of number fields. Let G = U(3) be the unitary group relative to E / F. In [\cite=Ro], Rogawski has defined a certain enlarged class of L-packet, or A-packet, using the endoscopic transfer of a one-dimensional character of the H = U(2)  ×  U(1), which is the unique elliptic endoscopic group for G.

More precisely, let [formula] be an one-dimensional automorphic character of H. An A-packet [formula] is the transfer of ϱ with respect to functoriality for an embedding of L-groups ξ:LH  →  LG. Then for all place v of F, Π(ϱv) contains a certain non-tempered representation πn(ϱv) and for a place which remains prime in E, it has an additional supercuspidal represenation πs(ϱv). Gelbart and Rogawski [\cite=Ge1] showed that the representations in this A-packet arise in the Weil representation of G. The main purpose of this article is to study the branching of the representations in this A-packet when restricted to U(2) over local fields.

For the branching problem of codimension 1 classical groups, there is the so called Gan-Gross-Prasad (GGP) conjecture, which was first formulated by Gross and Prasad for orthogonal groups and later, together with Gan, they extended it to all classical groups in [\cite=Gan2]. But this papers mainly concerns unitary group, we shall state the GGP conjecture only for unitary group. To state it, we need some notaions:

Let E / F be a quadratic extension of local fields of characteristic zero. Let Vn + 1 be a Hermitian space of dimension n + 1 over E and Wn a skew-Hermitian space of dimension n over E. Let Vn  ⊂  Vn + 1 be a nondegenerate subspace of codimension 1, so that if we set

[formula]

and

[formula]

then we have a diagonal embedding

[formula]

Let π be an irreducible smooth representation of Gn. In the Hermitian case, one is interested in computing

[formula]

We shall call this the Bessel case (B) of the GGP conjecture. To describe the GGP conjecture for the skew-Hermitian case, we need another piece of data: a Weil representation ωψ,χ,Wn, where ψ is a nontrivial additive character of F and χ is a character of E× whose restriction to F× is the quadratic character ωE / F associated to E / F by local class field theory. Then one is interested in computing

[formula]

We shall call this the Fourier-Jacobi case (FJ) of the GGP conjecture. To unify notation, we shall let [formula] or ωψ,χ,Wn in the respective cases.

By the result of [\cite=agrs], it is known

[formula]

and so we want to specify irreducible smooth representations π such that

[formula]

In [\cite=Gan2], Gan, Gross and Prasad has brought this problem into a more general setting using the notion of relevant pure inner forms of Gn and Vogan L-packets. A pure inner form of Gn is a group of the form

[formula]

where Vn'  ⊂  Vn + 1' are n and n + 1 dimensional hermitian spaces over E and Wn' is a n-dimensional skew hermitian spaces over E.

Furthermore, if

[formula]

we say that Gn' is relevant pure inner form. (Indeed, there are four pure inner forms of Gn and among them, only two are relevant.)

If Gn' is relevant, we set

[formula]

so that we have a diagonal embedding

[formula]

Now suppose that φ is an L-parameter for the group Gn. Then the (relevant) Vogan L-packet Πφ associated to φ consists of certain irreducible smooth representations of Gn and its (relevant) pure inner forms Gn' whose L-parameter is φ. We denote the relevant Vogan L-packet of φ by ΠRφ.

With these notions, we can loosely state the GGP conjecture as follows:

For tempered L-parameter φ, Beuzart-Plessis [\cite=bp1],[\cite=bp2],[\cite=bp3] established (B) case of the GGP conjecture and building upon Plessis's work, Gan and Ichino [\cite=iw] extended it for generic L-parameter relating it to generic (FJ) case.

In this paper, we shall investigate (B) case of this conjecture for G2 when a L-parameter of G2 involves some non-generic L-parameter of U(V3). More precisely, we have

The main idea for this is to consider the following see-saw diagram:

[formula]

Write [formula] in ΠRφ where π3∈Πφn and π2∈Πφt. Since all elements in the L-packet Πφn can be obtained by the theta lift from U(W1), we can write π3  =  Θψ,χ,V3,W1(σ) where σ is an irreducible smooth character of U(W1) and ψ,χ are some characters needed to fix a relevant Weil representation. By the see-saw identity, we have

[formula]

where [formula] is the contragredient representation of π2.

From this, we see that for having [formula], it should be preceded [formula], and in turn, we see that [formula] should be the theta lift from U(W1). This accounts for (i) in the Main Theorem.

As we shall see later, the L-parameter φn is not only non-tempered but also non-generic. Thus (i) says that the GGP conjecture might be false if the 'generic' condition was missed.

If [formula], then we can apply (FJ) for U(W1) to find the precise representations in the Vogan L-packet associated to the L-parameters of [formula] and σ. However, to find a representation π' in ([\ref=p]), we need to know the precise local theta correspondence between (U(W1),U(V3)) as well as (U(W1),U(V2)). For the precise local theta correspondence for codimension 0 and 1 cases, it was suggested and proved by Gan and Ichino in [\cite=iw] and that of (U(W1),U(V2)) immediately follows from it. However, for codimension equal or greater than 2, it is not known in general and even worse, there was no single example before. In Theorem [\ref=thm1], we suggest and prove the local theta correspondence for (U(W1),U(V3)) as our second main result.

For orthogonal group, such restriction problem for non-tempered L-parameter was already dealt in [\cite=gg] and [\cite=na]. Thus this paper can be seen as an analog of their works in the unitary group.

As an applicaition of our Main Theorem, we could establish the Ichino-Ikeda conjecture of the unitary group for the non-tempered case. In [\cite=Ich], Ichino and Ikeda defined the local period for a pair of tempered representations of orthogonal group using the matrix coefficients and conjectured that its non-vanishing would be equivalent to the existence of its Bessel model. This conjecture was settled by Waldspuger for the non-archimedean case, and Sakellaridis, Venkatesh [\cite=SV] and Plessis [\cite=bp2] established this conjecture in the setting of unitary group independently. However, if one consider a pair involving a non-tempered representation, the local period may diverge and so one needs to regularise it. In [\cite=Haan], the author introduced the regularized local period Pregv for some special pair of non-tempered representations. With this notion of regularised local period, we could prove

[formula]

when [formula], [formula] are local theta lifts for some irreducible and trivial representations [formula] of U(W1,v) respectively. This justifies the definition of Pregv for regularised local period and as a corollary, we can express the main result of [\cite=Haan] in the form of the original global Gross-Prasad conjecture under the assumption that ([\ref=ii]) also holds for archimedean places.

Let [formula] and [formula] be the global theta lifts of some automorphic character σ and trivial chracter [formula] of U(W1,v) to U(V3,v) and U(V2,v), respectively.Assume ([\ref=ii]) holds for archimedean cases. If [formula] for all places v of F, then we have

[formula]

where P is the global period functional of π3  ×  π2 defined by

[formula]

The rest of the paper is organised as follows; In Section 2, we give a brief sketch of the local Langlands correspondence for unitary group. In Section 3, we collect some results of the local theta correspondence for unitary group which we shall use in the proof of our main results. In Section 4, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm2] under the assumption of Theorem [\ref=thm1] whose proof will occupy the next Section 5. Finally, we give an application of our main result in Section 6.

Local Langlands correspondence for unitary group

By the recent work of Mok [\cite=Mok], and Kaletha-Mnguez-Shin-White [\cite=kmsw], the local Langlands correpondence is now known for unitary group conditional on the stabilization of the twisted trace formula. Since our main results are expressed using the local Langlands correspondence, we shall assume the local Langlands correspondence for unitary group throughout the paper. In this section, we list some of its properties which we shall use later. Indeed, much part of this section are excerpts from Section.2 in [\cite=iw].

Hermitian and skew-Hermitian spaces

Until section 5, we will use the symbol E / F to denote the quadratic extension of local fields of characteristic zero. For [formula], let V be a finite n-dimensional vector space over E equipped with a nondegenerate ε-Hermitian c-sesquilinear form 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉V:V  ×  V  →  E. That means for v,w∈V and a,b∈E, we have

[formula]

Denote [formula], so that

[formula]

Then we can define ε(V)  =    ±  1 by

[formula]

By a theorem of Landherr, for a given positive integer n, there are exactly two isomorphism classes of hermitian spaces of dimension n distinguished by ε(V). Let [formula] be the unitary group of V defined by

[formula]

Then U(V) turns out to be connected reductive algebraic group defined over F.

L-parameters and component groups

Let IF be the inertia subgroup of [formula]. Let [formula] be the Weil group of F and [formula] the Weil-Deligne group of F. For a homomorphism [formula], we say that it is a representation of [formula] if

φ is trivial on an open subgroup of IF,

φ is continuous and [formula] is semisimple,

the restriction of φ to [formula] is induced by a morphism of algebraic groups [formula]

For a representation φ of [formula], we say that φ is tempered when the image of WF is bounded. Define [formula] by [formula] and call this the contragredient representation of φ. For [formula], we define a representation φcs of [formula] by φcs(w)  =  φ(sws- 1). It is known that the equivalence class of φcs is independent of the choice of s. As we are only interested in the equivalence classes of representations, we shall denote φcs by φc suppressing s. Then we say that φ is conjugate self-dual if there is an isomorphism [formula] and for ε  =    ±  1, we say that φ is conjugate self-dual with sign ε if [formula].

Let V be an n-dimensional ε-hermitian space over E. An L-parameter for the unitary group [formula] is a homomorphism

[formula]

such that

the composite of φ with the projection onto [formula] is a representation of WDF

the composite of φ with the projection onto Gal(E / F) is the natural projection of [formula] to Gal(E / F).

The following proposition in [\cite=Gan2] enable us to removes the cumbersome Gal(E / F)-factor in the definition of L-parameter of U(V).

Restriction to WE of WF in [formula] gives a bijection between the set of L-parameters for U(V) and the set of equivalence classes of conjugate self-dual representations

[formula]

of sign ( - 1)n - 1.

With this proposition, henceforth, we shall mean an L-parameter for [formula] by n-dimensional conjugate self-dual representation φ of [formula] with sign ( - 1)n - 1.

Given an L-parameter φ of U(V), we can write φ as a direct sum

[formula]

with pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations φi of [formula] with multiplicities mi. We say that φ is square-integrable if for all i, mi = 1 and φi is conjugate self-dual with sign ( - 1)n - 1.

Given an L-parameter φ for [formula], we can assocaite its component group Sφ. As explained in [\cite=Gan2], Sφ is a finite 2-abelian group and it has a form

[formula]

with a canonical basis {aj}, where the product ranges over all j such that φj is conjugate self-dual with sign ( - 1)n - 1. If we denote the image of [formula] in Sφ by zφ, it is known that

[formula]

Local Langlands correspondence for unitary group

The aim of the local Langlands correspondence for unitary groups is to classify the irreducible smooth representations of unitary group. To state it, we first introduce some notations.

Let V+ and V- be the n-dimensional ε-Hermitian spaces with ε(V+)  =   + 1, ε(V-)  =   - 1 respectively.

For an L-parameter φ of U(V±), let Πφ be the Vogan L-packet associated to φ, which is a finite set of irreducible smooth representations of U(V±).

Let [formula] be the set of irreducible smooth representations of [formula].

Then the local Langlands correspondence in a form enhenced by Vogan [\cite=v], say that there is one to one correspondence between

[formula]

where φ on the right-hand side runs over all equivalence classes of L-parameters for [formula].

Then under the local Langlands correspondence, we may also decompose Πφ as

[formula]

where for ε  =    ±  1, Πεφ consists of the representations of [formula] in Πφ.

As explained in [\cite=Gan2], once an additive character [formula] is chosen, there is an associated bijection

[formula]

When n is odd, this bijection is always canonical and so does not depend on the choice of φ. However, when n is even, it depends on the choice of an additive character of [formula]. More precisely, such bijection is determined by the [formula]-orbit of nontrivial additive characters

[formula]

where

[formula]

Hereafter, if a nontrivial additive chracter [formula] is fixed, we use the notation

[formula]

as above once and for all.

The map Jψ enables us to label all irreducible smooth representations of [formula] with π(φ,η) for some unique L-parameter φ of U(V±) and [formula]. Once an additive character [formula] is fixed, we shall represent all irreducible smooth representations of [formula] as π(φ,η) with the implicit use of Jψ.

Properties of the local Langlands correspondence

We briefly list some properties of the local Langlands correspondence for unitary group, which we will use in this paper:

π(φ,η) is a representation of [formula] if and only if η(zφ)  =  ε.

π(φ,η) is tempered if and only if φ is tempered.

π(φ,η) is square-integrable if and only if φ is square-integrable.

The component groups Sφ and [formula] are canonically identified. Under this canonical identification, if we write π as π(φ,η), then the component character [formula] of its contragradient representation [formula] is η  ·  ν where

[formula]

If φ is a non-tempered L-parameter, we can decompose

[formula]

where

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  r, φi is a ki-dimensional representation of [formula] of the form [formula] for some tempered representation φi' of [formula] and some real number ei such that

[formula]

φ0 is a tempered L-parameter for [formula], where V±0 are the ε-Hermitian spaces of dimension [formula] over E.

We note that the natural map Sφ0  →  Sφ is an isomorphism.

Local theta correspondence

In this section, we state the local theta correspondence for three pairs of unitary groups, namely, (U(1),U(1)), (U(1),U(2)), (U(1),U(3)). From now on, for ε  =    ±  1, we shall denote by Vεn the n-dimensional Hermitian space with ε(Vεn)  =  ε and by Wεn the n-dimensional skew-Hermitian space with ε(Wεn)  =  ε, so that Wεn  =  δ  ·  Vεn.

The Weil representation for Unitary groups

In this subsection, we introduce the Weil representation. Since the constructiuons of global and local Weil representation are similar, we will treat both of them simultaneously. If the same statement can be applied to both the local and global cases, we will not use the distinguished notation U(V)(F) and [formula], but just refer them to U(V).

Let E / F be a quadratic extension of local or global fields and (V,〈,〉V) be a Hermitian space and (W,〈,〉W) a skew-Hermitian space over E.

Define the symplectic space

[formula]

with the symplectic form

[formula]

We also consider the associated symplectic group [formula] preserving [formula] and the metaplectic group [formula] satisfying the following short exact sequence :

[formula]

Let [formula] be a Lagrangian subspace of [formula] and we fix an additive character [formula] (globally) or [formula] (locally). Then we have a Schrödinger model of the Weil Representation ωψ of [formula] on [formula], where S is the Schwartz-Bruhat function space.

Once and for all, we fix an unitary character χ of [formula] or E× whose resriction to [formula] of F× is ωE / F. Let χV,χW be unitary characters of [formula] or E× such that

[formula]

By [\cite=Ha], such a choice (χV,χW) determines a splitting homomorphism

[formula]

and so by composing this to ωψ, we have a Weil representation [formula] of U(V)  ×  U(W) on [formula].

Throughout the rest of the paper, when it comes to a Weil representations of U(V)  ×  U(W), we shall denote [formula] by ωψ,W,V with understanding the choices of characters (χV,χW) was made as follows:

[formula]

When dim EW = 1, the image of U(W) in [formula] coincides with the image of the center of U(V), so we can regard the Weil representation of U(V)  ×  U(W) as the representation of U(V) and we denote the Weil representation as just ωψ,V.

Local theta correspondence

Given a Weil representation ωψ,W,V of U(V)  ×  U(W) and an irreducible smooth representation π of U(W), the maximal π-isotypic quotient of ωψ,V,W, say [formula], is of the form

[formula]

for some smooth representation Θψ,V,W(π) of U(V) of finite length. By the Howe duality, which was first proved by Waldspurger [\cite=w] except for p  ≠  2 and recently completed by Gan and Takeda in [\cite=gt1], [\cite=gt2], the maximal semisimple quotient θψ,V,W(π) of Θψ,V,W(π) is either zero or irreducible.

In this paper, we consider three kinds of theta correspondences for [formula] :

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For the cases [formula], D. Prasad conjectured the local theta correspondence in terms of the local Langlands correspondence and quite recently, Gan and Ichino proved both cases in [\cite=gi], [\cite=iw]. For what follows, we fix an additive character [formula].

Case (i)

We first consider the theta correspondence for [formula]. The following summarises some results of [\cite=gi], [\cite=iw], which are specialised to this case.

Let φ be an L-parameter for [formula]. Then we have:

For any fixed π∈Πε'φ, exactly one of Θψ,V+1,Wε'1(π) or Θψ,V-1,Wε'1(π) is nonzero.

Θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π)  ≠  0 if and only if

[formula]

where

[formula]

If Θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π) is nonzero, then θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π) has L-parameter

[formula]

The theta correspondence π  ↦  θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π) gives a bijection

[formula]

Let [formula] Since n = 1 and φ  =  θ(φ), there is the same bijection

[formula]

With these bijections, we can describe the bijection

[formula]

induced by the theta correspondence in (iv) as follows:

[formula]

If Θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π) is nonzero, then Θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π) is irreducible and so Θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π) = θψ,Vε1,Wε'1(π).

Case (ii)

Now we shall consider the theta correspondence for [formula]. The following summarises some results of [\cite=gi], [\cite=iw], which are specialised to this case.

Let φ be an L-parameter for [formula]. Then we have:

Suppose that φ  =  χ2.

For any π∈Πε'φ, Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) is nonzero and θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) has L-parameter

[formula]

For each ε  =    ±  1, the theta correspondence π  ↦  θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) gives a bijection

[formula]

Suppose that φ contains χ2.

For any fixed π∈Πε'φ, exactly one of Θψ,V+2,Wε'1(π) or Θψ,V-2,Wε'1(π) is nonzero.

If Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) is nonzero, then θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) has L-parameter

[formula]

The theta correspondence π  ↦  θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) gives a bijection

[formula]

If φ  ≠  χ2, let

[formula]

where the extra copy of [formula] of Sθ(φ) arises from the summand χ in θ(φ). Using the two bijections

[formula]

we obtain a bijection

[formula]

induced by the theta correspondence, where [formula] is the set of irreducible characters η' of Sθ(φ) such that η'(zθ(φ))  =  η'((b1,1))  ·  η'((1,b2)) = ε, and the bijection is determined by

[formula]

If φ  =  χ2, then [formula], and so

[formula]

Thus, one has a canonical bijection

[formula]

induced by the theta correspondence and it is given by

[formula]

If Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) is nonzero, then Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) is irreducible and so Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π) = θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π).

Case (iii)

Now we shall consider the theta correspondence for [formula]. The following summarises some results of [\cite=Ge1], [\cite=Ge2], [\cite=Ha].

Let φ be a L-parameter of U(W±1). Then we have:

For any [formula] and any π∈Πε'φ, Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) is nonzero and irreducible.

Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) [formula]

The L-parameter θ(φ) of Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) has the following two forms;

[formula]

where [formula] is the tautological 2-dimensional representation of [formula]

The property (i) follows from the Proposition 2.5.1 (b) in [\cite=Ge2]. The Proposition 5.2.2 in [\cite=Ge2] asserts that Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) is supercuspidal if and only if [formula] where χ1 is the restriction of χ to E1. Since the base change of χ1 to GL1(E) is defined by [formula], the L-parameter of [formula] is [formula]. Thus by the Theorem [\ref=Te] (ii),

[formula]

and this accounts for the property (ii). The property (iii) follows from the description of L-parameters of Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) in [\cite=Ha]. (see page 985)

The following theorem explicates a precise local theta correspondence between (U(Wε'1),U(Vε3)). The proof of this will be given in Section 5.

Let φ be a L-parameter of U(W±1) and for π∈Πε'φ, let θ1(φ), θ2(φ) be the two possible L-parameters of Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) as above. Then we have

For ε,ε' such that [formula], the theta correspondence π  ↦  θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) gives a bijection

[formula]

For ε,ε' such that [formula], the theta correspondence π  ↦  θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π) gives an injection

[formula]

Write

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(Note θ2(φ) is the square-integrable L-parameter of U(Vε3) and so [formula] of Sθ2(φ) arises from the summand [formula] in θ2(φ).)

Using three bijections

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

the following bijection and inclusion induced by the theta correspondence

[formula]

[formula]

can be explicated as follows:

[formula]

Main Theorem

In this section, we prove our main theorem. Before to state our main theorem, we first elaborate on the results of Plessis and Gan-Ichino for the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for unitary groups, some of which we shall use in the proof our main theorem. In [\cite=iw], Gan and Ichino made a neat exposition on this, we quote their treatment here. Throughout this section, we fix a nontrivial additive character [formula] and make a tacit use Jψ for the bijection in the local Langlands correspondence.

Pairs of spaces

To exlplain both the (Bessel) and (Fourier-Jacobi) cases of the Gross-Prasad conjecture simulataneously, we consider the pair of spaces:

[formula]

Then their relevant pure inner form (other than itself) are

[formula]

For a∈F×, if we set La denotes the a 1-dimensional Hermitian space with form [formula], then

[formula]

Write

[formula]

[formula]

and we have a diagonal embedding

[formula]

For an L-parameter [formula] for G±n, its assoicated component group is:

[formula]

Let η be a compont chracter of Sφ. Then under the local Langlands correspondence, the representation π(η)∈Πφ is a representation of a relevant pure inner form if and only if

[formula]

and π(η) is a representation of Gεn if and only if

[formula]

The recipe

In this subsection, we define the distinguished characters for the recipe of the GGP conjecture. For an L-parameter [formula] of Gn, write

[formula]

Then η∈Sφ is completely determined by the signs η(ai)  =    ±  1 and η(bj)  =    ±  1.

We define the relevant distinguished characters of Sφ for the Bessel and Fourier-Jacobi cases as follows:

Bessel case. We set [formula] and define [formula] as follows:

[formula]

Fourier-Jacobi case. We set [formula] and [formula]. The distinguished character [formula] of Sφ depends on the parity of n  =   dim Wεn as follows:

If n is odd, we set

If n is even, we set

[formula]

Theorem (B) and (FJ) for tempered parameter

We state the results of Plessis and Gan-Ichino on the GGP conjecture.

For a generic L-parameter φ for [formula] and a representation π(η)∈Πφ of a relevant pure inner form Gεn,

[formula]

For a generic L-parameter φ for [formula] and a representation π(η)∈Πφ of a relevant pure inner form Gεn,

[formula]

Denote the collection of (B)n and (FJ)n for all n  ≥  1 by (B) and (FJ) respecively. We remark that (FJ) was proved by Gan and Ichino in [\cite=iw] and (B) was first proved by Beuzart Plessis in [\cite=bp1], [\cite=bp2], [\cite=bp3] for the tempered L-parameter and then extended to generic case by Gan and Ichino [\cite=iw].

The main theorem of this paper investigates the (Bessel case) of the conjecture for some endoscopic L-parameters for U(V±3)  ×  U(V±2) involving a non-generic (and thus non-tempered) parameter of U(V±3). Now we state our main theorem.

Let φ1,φ2 be a L-parameter of U(W±1) such that φ2  ≠  χ2 and let

[formula]

[formula]

be the two L-parameters of U(V±3) appeared in Theorem [\ref=theta] (iii) and let

[formula]

be the L-parameters of U(V±2) appeared in Theorem [\ref=Tae] (ii). Write

[formula]

Then for i = 1,2, and for (πi3,πi2)∈Πθi(φ1)  ×  Πθ(φ2),

[formula]

where the pair of component characters [formula] is specified as follows;

[formula]

and

[formula]

In this proof, we assume Theorem [\ref=thm1] whose proof will be given in the next section.

We first prove the existence of some ε and (πi3,πi2)∈Πεθi(φ1)  ×  Πεθ(φ2) such that [formula] for each i = 1,2.

One has the see-saw diagram : (ε,ε' will be determined soon)

[formula]

We consider the three theta correspondence in this diagram :

U(Vε3)  ×  U(Wε1) relative to the pair of characters (χ3,χ);

[formula] relative to the pair of characters (χ2,χ);

[formula] relative to the pair of characters (χ,χ).

Let us take [formula] Then by (FJ)1, we have

[formula]

(here, πφ- 12,πφ1∈Πε'φ- 12  ×  Πε'φ1 and note that the set Πε'φ- 12  ×  Πε'φ1 is singleton.) Since πφ- 12,πφ1 are both unitary, one has

[formula]

and the L-parameter of [formula] is φ2. For any [formula], Theorem [\ref=Tae] (i) asserts that there is τ∈Πεθ(φ2) such that [formula] Then by the see-saw identity, one has

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=thm1], the L-parameter of ΘVε3,Wε'1(πφ1) depends on the ε as follows :

[formula]

Thus we proved the existence (πi3,πi2)∈Πεθi(φ1)  ×  Πεθ(φ2) such that [formula] for each i = 1,2.

Next, we shall show that such a pair (πi3,πi2) is unique and their component characters are exactly the same one suggested in ([\ref=eta1]), ([\ref=eta2]).

For i = 2, the uniqueness directly follows from (B)2 because θ(2)(φ1) is a tempered L-parameter. (Note that supercuspidal L-parameter of U(Vε3) is tempered because the center of U(Vε3) is compact.)

Thus we if set

[formula]

[formula]

the pair (ΘVε3,Wε'1(πφ1),τ) in the above argument is the very one which makes [formula]. If we combine this with Theorem [\ref=Tae] and Theorem [\ref=thm1], we can easily check that their associated component characters are [formula] in ([\ref=eta2]).

Now, we suppose [formula] for some (π13,π12)∈Πθ(1)(φ1)  ×  Πθ(φ2). By Theorem [\ref=thm1], we can write π13  =  Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(σ) for some σ∈Πε'φ1 and using the see-saw identity, one has

[formula]

In particular, we see Θψ,Wε'1,Vε2(π12)  ≠  0. Since Θψ,Wε'1,Vε2(π12) and σ are both unitary, we have

[formula]

and by Theorem [\ref=Tae] (i), the L-parameter of [formula] is φ- 12. Thus by (FJ)1, we see that

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=Tae] and Theorem [\ref=thm1], one has

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

(The third equality follows from [formula])

Recall that an L-parameter φ of U(V±n) or U(W±n) is called generic if its adjoint L-function

[formula]

is holomorphic at s = 0. Here, Ad is the adjoint representation of LU(n) on its Lie algebra Lie(LU(n)). Gross, Prasad and Rallis predicts that φ is generic if and only if its assiciated L-packet Πφ has a generic represenatio and Gan and Ichino proved this in Proposition B.1 in Appendix in [\cite=iw]. Since the Corollary 4.2.3 in [\cite=Ge2] asserts that all elements in Πθ1(φ1) have no Whittaker models, we see that θ1(φ1) is non-generic.

As we mentioned in Remark [\ref=rem1.1], the GGP-conjecture may no longer true for non-generic L-parameter and Theorem [\ref=thm2] shows that for having [formula], the L-parameter of π2 should be of very special form, namely, a theta lift from U(W±1).

If π3  =  Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(φ1), π2  =  Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(φ2) for some L-parameters φ1,φ2 of U(Wε'1), then the above result is condensed into one sentence as follows:

[formula]

In the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm2], the unique pair of representations (π23,π22)∈Πθ2(φ1)  ×  Πθ(φ2) such that

[formula]

are obtained by the theta lifts from U(Wε'1). However, if φ2  =  χ2, the following proposition says that this is not true.

We retain the same notation as in Theorem [\ref=thm2] except for φ2  =  χ2 so that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Furthermore, [formula], which suggested in the recipe of (B)2 in this case, does not come from the theta lifts of U(W±1).

We first note that zθ(φ2), the image of [formula] in Sθ(φ2), is 2b1 and so for every η∈Sθ(φ2), one has η(zθ(φ2)) = 1 and Πθ(φ2)  =  Π1θ(φ2). Thus every nonzero π12∈Πθ(φ2) is indeed in Π1θ(φ2). By Theorem [\ref=thm1], all element π13∈Πθ(1)(φ1) can be written π13  =  Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(σ) for some [formula] such that [formula] and σ∈Πε'φ1. Thus in order to have [formula], there is no choice but to choose ε = 1 and so ε' should be [formula] when writing π13 as the theta lift from U(Wε'1). With these choices of [formula], the see-saw identity gives

[formula]

For having [formula], Θψ,Wε'1,Vε2(π12) should be nonzero and in view of Theorem [\ref=Tae] (ii), π12 should be ΘVε2,Wε'1(τ), where τ is the unique nonzero representation τ in Πε'φ2. (Note that Πε'φ2 is singleton.) Since [formula] and

[formula]

has L-parameter φ- 12, our choice [formula] and (FJ)1 implies

[formula]

Thus we have contructed the unique pair

[formula]

which makes [formula] and using Theorem [\ref=Tae] and Theorem [\ref=thm1], one can easily check that their component characters are as in ([\ref=phi]).

Next, we suppose that there is (σ,τ)∈Πε'φ1  ×  Πε''φ2 such that

[formula]

By the see-saw identity, [formula] and so

[formula]

If ε'  ≠  ε'', then by Theorem [\ref=Tae] (ii), we see that ΘVε2,Wε'1(ΘVε2,Wε''1(τ)) = 0 and so ε' = ε''. As in the above discussion, we also know that Πθ(φ2)  =  Π1θ(φ2) and so ε should be 1. Since ΘVε2,Wε'1(ΘVε2,Wε'1(τ)) = τ∈Πε'φ2 and [formula] (FJ)1 implies that

[formula]

However, by Theorem [\ref=thm1], [formula] and so we have a contradiction. Thus we see that the recipe given in (B)2 does not obtained by the theta lift from U(Wε'1).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] using the (FJ)1 and see-saw identity.

The first two statements on the existence of bijection and injection are immediate from Theorem [\ref=theta] (ii). To find the precise maps using the local Langlands correspondence, we consider the see-saw diagram:

[formula]

Recall that we are given an L-parameter φ for U(W±1) and π  =  π(φ,η)∈Πε'φ where η(a1) = ε'. Suppose

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=theta], we know that Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π(φ,η)) is non-tempered and η(a1) = ε', and θ1(η)(a1) = ε and so the local theta correspondence would follow easily in this case.

On the other hand, we suppose

[formula]

We choose an L-parameter φ0  ≠  χ2 of U(Wε'1) such that

[formula]

Since φ,φ0 are unitary, for π(φ0,η0)∈Πε'φ0, we know that

[formula]

(the second equality follows from the (FJ)1 because the L-parameter of [formula] is φ- 10.) Then by the see-saw idenity, we have

[formula]

In particular,

[formula]

and by Theorem [\ref=Tae] (i), it has L-parameter

[formula]

and denote its component group by

[formula]

Note that the theta lift Θψ,Vε3,Wε'1(π(φ,η)) is supercuspidal and since U(Wε'1) is compact, it is tempered representation. Furthermore since Θψ,Vε2,Wε'1(π(φ0,η0)) is tempered, (B)2 implies

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where ψE- 2(x) = ψE( - 2x).

Recall that for an L-parameter φ of U(Vn) or U(Wn),

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

[formula]

and so we see

[formula]

On the other hand, from Theorem [\ref=Tae],

[formula]

and so we have

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we see that

[formula]

and it forces

[formula]

From these things, one can deduce

[formula]

as we claimed.

Ichino-Ikeda conjecture for the non-tempered case

In this section, we give an analog of the Ichino-Ikeda conjecture for some non-tempered case using Theorem [\ref=thm2]. To state our result, we review the notion of regularised local period introduced in [\cite=Haan].

Let E / F be a quadratic extension of number fields with [formula] their adele rings. For a place v of F, let Fv be the completion of F at v and [formula]. For a (skew) hermitian space V over E and a place v∈F, consider [formula] as a (skew) hermitian space over Ev. Then we have a decomposition

[formula]

where v runs over all place of F and [formula]

With this decomposition, we have

[formula]

and if π is an automorphic representation of [formula], we also have its decomposition [formula] where πv is an irreducible admissible representation of U(Vεvv)(Fv).

Let V2 be a 2-dimension hermitian space over E, W1 be a 1-dimension skew-hermitian space over E and L be a hermitian line over E with a form [formula]. Define [formula]. Note that ε(V3,v) = ε(V2,v) for all v, because ε(Lv) = 1 for all v.

Let us see the following see-saw diagram

[formula]

In this diagram, we consider the three local and global theta correspondence :

U(V3)  ×  U(W1) relative to the pair of characters (ψ,χ3,χ);

[formula] relative to the pair of characters (ψ,χ2,χ);

[formula] relative to the pair of characters (ψ,χ,χ).

where ψ,χ are those we defined in Section [\ref=not]. For what follows, we suppress these choices from the notation.

Let [formula] be an automorphic character of [formula] and [formula] be the trivial character of [formula].

Let π3: = ΘV3,W1(σ) and [formula] be the non-trivial global theta lifts of [formula] to [formula] and [formula] respectively. For all place v of F, if we set

[formula]

then by Howe duality, one has [formula] for i = 2,3. Note that the two maps

[formula]

are U(V3)(Fv)  ×  U(W1)(Fv) and U(V2)(Fv)  ×  U(W1)(Fv) equivariant surjective maps and by Theorem [\ref=Tae] and [\ref=theta], the big theta lifts ΘVεv3,v,Wε'v1,v(σv), [formula] are both irreducible. Thus we can define the local inner products Bπi,v on πi,v for i = 2,3 as follows:

For [formula], f31,v,f32,v∈σv and [formula], let

[formula]

and

[formula]

where BωVi,W1 for i = 2,3 are the local inner products of the Weil representations and Bσv, [formula] are the local inner products of [formula] respectively. With these choices of local inner products, Haan [\cite=Haan] defined the regularised local period Pregv as follows;

For f3,v∈π3,v and f2,v∈π2,v, let

[formula]

(here, cv is a non-zero constant for each v and Δ(gv) is some determinant map appearing in the doubling method. For the precise definition of cv and Δ(gv), we refer the reader to section 3.2 in [\cite=Haan].)

From (Step 2) in the proof of the Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=Haan], we easily see that the regularised local period Pregv is just the unfolding expression of the multiplication of two local zeta integrals, that is,

[formula]

where fπ2,v∈π2,v,fσv∈σv, [formula] and

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

By Proposition 11.6 in [\cite=Gan], we see that the non-vanishing of these two local zeta integrals [formula] is equivalent to the non-vanishing of the local theta lifts ΘW1,v,V2,v(π2,v),ΘW1,v,L1,v(σv) respectively. Thus one has

[formula]

However, since π2,v is the non-trivial theta lift from the trivial character [formula] of U(W1)(Fv),

[formula]

and so the non-vanishing of Pregv solely depends on the non-vanishing of ΘW1,v,L1,v(σv). From this observation, we have the following theorem.

Using the notation as in the ([\ref=app]), for non-archimedean place v, we have

[formula]

If v is split, all relevent groups are general linear groups and so we consider the following see-saw diagram:

[formula]

Thus by the see-saw identity,

[formula]

From the Theorem 17.2 in [\cite=Gan2],

[formula]

and so one has

[formula]

On the other hand, if one follows the similar argument as in the Proposition 2.6.1 in [\cite=Ge2], one can have [formula]. (Indeed, it is known that the theta lift from GLn(Fv) to GLn(Fv) just taking its contragradient representation.) Thus we see that the theorem holds for splitting places v.

Next, suppose that v remains prime in E. Then by Remark [\ref=rem1], we have

[formula]

On the other hand, from Theorem [\ref=Te], one has

[formula]

Thus we verified our claim for primes v which inerts in E.
