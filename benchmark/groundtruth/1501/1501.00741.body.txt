Introduction

The main purpose of this short paper is to establish:

Let (X,Δ) be a projective semi-log-canonical pair and let L be an ample Cartier divisor on X. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] is a naive generalization of the Kodaira vanishing theorem for semi-log-canonical pairs. As a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1], we have:

Let (X,Δ) be a projective log-canonical pair and let L be an ample Cartier divisor on X. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

Precisely speaking, we prove the following theorem in this paper. Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] is a relative version of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] and obviously contains Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] as a special case.

Let (X,Δ) be a semi-log-canonical pair and let f:X  →  Y be a projective morphism between quasi-projective varieties. Let L be an f-ample Cartier divisor on X. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

Although Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] has not been stated explicitly in the literature, it easily follows from [\cite=fujino-slc], [\cite=fujino-vanishing], [\cite=fujino-foundation], and so on. In our framework, Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] can be seen as a generalization of Kollár's vanishing theorem by the theory of mixed Hodge structures. The statement of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] is a naive generalization of the Kodaira vanishing theorem. However, Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] is not a simple generalization of the Kodaira vanishing theorem from the Hodge-theoretic viewpoint.

We note the dual form of the Kodaira vanishing theorem for Cohen-Macaulay projective semi-log-canonical pairs.

Let (X,Δ) be a projective semi-log-canonical pair and let L be an ample Cartier divisor on X. Assume that X is Cohen-Macaulay. Then

[formula]

for every i <  dim X.

The dual form of the Kodaira vanishing theorem, that is, Hi(X,OX( - L)) = 0 for every ample Cartier divisor L and every i <  dim X, implies that X is Cohen-Macaulay (see, for example, [\cite=kollar-mori]). Therefore, the assumption that X is Cohen-Macaulay in Corollary [\ref=cor1.4] is indispensable.

In [\cite=kss], Corollary [\ref=cor1.4] was obtained for semi-log-canonical pairs (see [\cite=kss]). Therefore, [\cite=kss] is stronger than Corollary [\ref=cor1.4]. The arguments in [\cite=kss] depend on the theory of Du Bois singularities. Our approach (see [\cite=fujino-unpublished], [\cite=fujino-introduction], [\cite=fujino-slc], [\cite=fujino-vanishing], [\cite=fujino-injectivity], [\cite=fujino-reid-fukuda], [\cite=fujino-foundation], and so on) to various vanishing theorems for reducible varieties uses the theory of mixed Hodge structures for cohomology with compact support and is different from [\cite=kss].

Finally, we note that we can easily generalize Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] as follows.

Let (X,Δ) be a semi-log-canonical pair and let f:X  →  Y be a projective morphism between quasi-projective varieties. Let L be a Cartier divisor on X such that L is nef and log big over Y with respect to (X,Δ). Then

[formula]

for every i > 0.

For the definition of nef and log big divisors on semi-log-canonical pairs, see Definition [\ref=def2.3]. Theorem [\ref=thm1.7] is a relative vanishing theorem of Reid-Fukuda type for semi-log-canonical pairs. It is obvious that Theorem [\ref=thm1.1], Theorem [\ref=thm1.2], and Corollary [\ref=cor1.4] hold true under the weaker assumption that L is nef and log big with respect to (X,Δ) by Theorem [\ref=thm1.7].

Throughout this paper, we will work over [formula], the field of complex numbers. We will use the basic definitions and the standard notation of the minimal model program and semi-log-canonical pairs in [\cite=fujino-funda], [\cite=fujino-slc], [\cite=fujino-foundation], and so on.

Preliminaries

In this section, we quickly recall some basic definitions and results for semi-log-canonical pairs for the reader's convenience. Throughout this paper, a variety means a reduced separated scheme of finite type over [formula].

Let us recall the definition of semi-log-canonical pairs.

Let X be an equidimensional variety that satisfies Serre's S2 condition and is normal crossing in codimension one. Let Δ be an effective [formula]-divisor such that no irreducible components of Δ are contained in the singular locus of X. The pair (X,Δ) is called a semi-log-canonical pair if

KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier, and

(Xν,Θ) is log-canonical, where ν:Xν  →  X is the normalization and KXν  +  Θ  =  ν*(KX  +  Δ).

A subvariety W of X is called an slc stratum with respect to (X,Δ) if there exist a resolution of singularities ρ:Z  →  Xν and a prime divisor E on Z such that a(E,Xν,Θ) =  - 1 and [formula] or if W is an irreducible component of X.

For the basic definitions and properties of log-canonical pairs, see [\cite=fujino-funda]. For the details of semi-log-canonical pairs, see [\cite=fujino-slc]. We need the notion of nef and log big divisors on semi-log-canonical pairs for Theorem [\ref=thm1.7]

Let (X,Δ) be a semi-log-canonical pair and let f:X  →  Y be a projective morphism between quasi-projective varieties. Let L be a Cartier divisor on X. Then L is nef and log big over Y with respect to (X,Δ) if L is nef and OX(L)|W is big over Y for every slc stratum W of (X,Δ). We simply say that L is nef and log big with respect to (X,Δ) when [formula].

Roughly speaking, in [\cite=fujino-slc], we proved the following theorem.

Let (X,Δ) be a quasi-projective semi-log-canonical pair. Then we can construct a smooth quasi-projective variety M with dim M =  dim X + 1, a simple normal crossing divisor Z on M, a subboundary [formula]-divisor B on M, and a projective surjective morphism h:Z  →  X with the following properties.

B and Z have no common irreducible components.

[formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor on M.

[formula] such that ΔZ = B|Z.

h*OZ(⌈  -  Δ< 1Z⌉)≃OX.

By the properties (1), (2), (3), and (4),

[formula]

For the details of Theorem [\ref=thm2.4], see [\cite=fujino-slc]. In this paper, we do not discuss quasi-log schemes. For the theory of quasi-log schemes, see [\cite=fujino-introduction], [\cite=fujino-pull], [\cite=fujino-foundation], and so on.

The morphism h:(Z,ΔZ)  →  X in Theorem [\ref=thm2.4] is called a quasi-log resolution. Note that the quasi-log structure of

[formula]

We note the notion of simple normal crossing pairs. It is useful for our purposes in this paper.

Let Z be a simple normal crossing divisor on a smooth variety M and let B be an [formula]-divisor on M such that [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor and that B and Z have no common irreducible components. We put ΔZ = B|Z and consider the pair (Z,ΔZ). We call (Z,ΔZ) a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair. A pair (Y,ΔY) is called a simple normal crossing pair if it is Zariski locally isomorphic to a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair.

If (X,0) is a simple normal crossing pair, then X is called a simple normal crossing variety. Let X be a simple normal crossing variety and let D be a Cartier divisor on X. If (X,D) is a simple normal crossing pair and D is reduced, then D is called a simple normal crossing divisor on X.

For the details of simple normal crossing pairs, see [\cite=fujino-slc], [\cite=fujino-vanishing], [\cite=fujino-injectivity], [\cite=fujino-pull], [\cite=fujino-foundation], and so on. We note that a simple normal crossing pair is called in [\cite=kollar] (see also [\cite=bierstone-p]) and that a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair is called an in [\cite=kollar].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3]

In this section, we prove Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] and discuss some related results.

Let us start with an easy lemma. The following lemma is more or less well-known to the experts.

Let X be a normal irreducible variety and let Δ be an effective [formula]-divisor on X such that (X,Δ) is log-canonical. Let ρ:Z  →  X be a proper birational morphism from a smooth variety Z such that [formula] and [formula] are simple normal crossing divisors on Z. Let S be an integral divisor on X such that 0  ≤  S  ≤  Δ and let T be the strict transform of S. Then we have ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E)≃OX(KX + S).

We give a proof of Lemma [\ref=lem3.1] here for the reader's convenience. The following proof is in [\cite=kss].

We choose KZ and KX satisfying ρ*KZ = KX. It is obvious that ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E)  ⊂  OX(KX + S) since E is ρ-exceptional and OX(KX + S) satisfies Serre's S2 condition. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that OX(KX + S)  ⊂  ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E). Note that we may assume that Δ is an effective [formula]-divisor by perturbing the coefficients of Δ slightly. Let U be any nonempty Zariski open set of X. We will see that Γ(U,OX(KX + S))  ⊂  Γ(U,ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E)). We take a nonzero rational function g of U such that [formula], that is, g∈Γ(U,OX(KX + S)), where (g) is the principal divisor associated to g. We assume that U = X by shrinking X for simplicity. Let a be a positive integer such that a(KX  +  Δ) is Cartier. We have ρ*(a(KX  +  Δ)) = aKZ + aΔ' + Ξ, where Δ' is the strict transform of Δ and Ξ is a ρ-exceptional integral divisor on Z. By assumption, we have 0  ≤  (g) + KX + S  ≤  (g) + KX  +  Δ. Then we obtain that

[formula]

since Ξ  ≤  aE. Thus we obtain (ρ*g) + KZ  +  Δ' + E  ≥  0.

(ρ*g) + KZ + T + E  ≥  0.

By construction,

[formula]

where every irreducible component of F + E is ρ-exceptional. We also have

[formula]

where Δ' - T is effective and no irreducible components of Δ' - T are ρ-exceptional. Note that [formula] and (ρ*g) + KZ  +  Δ' + E  ≥  0. Therefore, we have (ρ*g) + KZ + T + E  ≥  0.

This means that Γ(U,OX(KX + S))  ⊂  Γ(U,ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E)) for any nonempty Zariski open set U. Thus, we have OX(KX + S) = ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E).

We need the following remark for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.7] in Section [\ref=sec4].

In Lemma [\ref=lem3.1], we put

[formula]

where Ei's are the ρ-exceptional divisors with a(Ei,X,Δ) =  - 1. Then we see that ρ*OZ(KZ + T + E')≃OX(KX + S) by the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem3.1].

Although Theorem [\ref=thm1.2] is a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] and Theorem [\ref=thm1.3], we give a simple proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.2] for the reader's convenience. For this purpose, let us recall an easy generalization of Kollár's vanishing theorem.

Let f:V  →  W be a morphism from a smooth projective variety V onto a projective variety W. Let D be a simple normal crossing divisor on V. Let H be an ample Cartier divisor on W. Then [formula] for i > 0 and j  ≥  0.

For the proof, see [\cite=fujino-higher] (see also [\cite=fujino-on-injectivity], [\cite=fujino-funda], and so on). If D = 0 in Theorem [\ref=thm3.3], then Theorem [\ref=thm3.3] is nothing but Kollár's vanishing theorem. For more general results, see [\cite=fujino-on-injectivity], [\cite=fujino-funda], and so on (see also Theorem [\ref=thm3.7] below, [\cite=fujino-vanishing], [\cite=fujino-foundation], and so on, for vanishing theorems for reducible varieties).

Let us start the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.2] (see [\cite=fujino-introduction] when Δ = 0).

We take a projective birational morphism ρ:Z  →  X from a smooth projective variety Z such that [formula] and [formula] are simple normal crossing divisors on Z. By Theorem [\ref=thm3.3], we obtain that [formula] for every i > 0. By Lemma [\ref=lem3.1], ρ*OZ(KZ + E)≃OX(KX). Therefore, we have Hi(X,OX(KX + L)) = 0 for every i > 0.

The following key proposition for the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] is a generalization of Lemma [\ref=lem3.1].

Let (X,Δ) be a quasi-projective semi-log-canonical pair such that the irreducible components of X have no self-intersection in codimension one. Then there exist a birational quasi-log resolution h:(Z,ΔZ)  →  X from a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair (Z,ΔZ) and a simple normal crossing divisor E on Z such that h*OZ(KZ + E)≃OX(KX).

Since X is quasi-projective and the irreducible components of X have no self-intersection in codimension one, we can construct a birational quasi-log resolution h:(Z,ΔZ)  →  X by [\cite=fujino-slc] (see Theorem [\ref=thm2.4]), where (Z,ΔZ) is a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair and the ambient space M of (Z,ΔZ) is a smooth quasi-projective variety. By the construction of h:Z  →  X in [\cite=fujino-slc], [formula], the singular locus of Z, maps birationally onto the closure of [formula], where [formula] is the open subset of X which has only smooth points and simple normal crossing points of multiplicity ≤  2. We put [formula]. Note that E contains no irreducible components of [formula] by construction. By taking a blow-up of Z along E and a suitable birational modification (see [\cite=bierstone-p]), we may assume that E and [formula] are simple normal crossing divisors on Z. In particular, (Z,E) is a simple normal crossing pair (see Definition [\ref=def2.6]). Note that [\cite=fujino-pull] may help us understand how to make (Z,ΔZ) a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair. We may assume that the support of KZ does not contain any irreducible components of [formula] since Z is quasi-projective. We may also assume that h*KZ = KX. Then we have h*OZ(KZ + E)  ⊂  OX(KX) since OX(KX) satisfies Serre's S2 condition and E is h-exceptional. We fix an embedding OZ(KZ + E)  ⊂  KZ, where KZ is the sheaf of total quotient rings of OZ. Note that [formula] is an isomorphism. We put [formula] and consider the natural open immersion [formula]. Then we have an embedding OX(KX)  ⊂  KX, where KX is the sheaf of total quotient rings of OX, by [formula]. Let νX:Xν  →  X be the normalization and let CXν be the divisor on Xν defined by the conductor ideal [formula] of X (see, for example, [\cite=fujino-slc]). Then we have OX(KX)  ⊂  (νX)*OXν(KXν  +  CXν). We put KXν  +  Θ  =  ν*X(KX  +  Δ). Then 0  ≤  CXν  ≤  Θ and (Xν,Θ) is log-canonical by definition. Let νZ:Zν  →  Z be the normalization. Thus we have KZν  +  CZν  =  ν*ZKZ, where CZν is the simple normal crossing divisor on Zν defined by the conductor ideal [formula] of Z. Now we have the following commutative diagram.

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem3.1] and its proof, we see that OXν(KXν  +  CXν) = hν*OZν(KZν  +  CZν  +  ν*ZE). Therefore, we obtain

[formula]

This implies that OX(KX)  ⊂  h*OZ(KZ + E). Note that [formula] is an isomorphism. Thus, we obtain OX(KX) = h*OZ(KZ + E) since h*OZ(KZ + E)  ⊂  OX(KX).

For the details of KZ and KX, we recommend the reader to see the paper-back edition of [\cite=liu] published in 2006 (see also [\cite=kleiman]). Note that the sheaf of total quotient rings is called the sheaf of stalks of meromorphic functions in [\cite=liu].

As in Remark [\ref=rem3.2], in Proposition [\ref=prop3.4], we put

[formula]

where Ei's are the h-exceptional divisors with the discrepancy coefficient [formula]. Then we have h*OZ(KZ + E')≃OX(KX) in Proposition [\ref=prop3.4]. This easily follows from Remark [\ref=rem3.2] and the proof of Proposition [\ref=prop3.4].

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3], we use the following vanishing theorem, which is obviously a generalization of Theorem [\ref=thm3.3]. For the proof, see [\cite=fujino-vanishing] (see also [\cite=fujino-foundation]).

Let (Z,C) be a simple normal crossing pair such that C is a boundary [formula]-divisor on Z. Let h:Z  →  X be a proper morphism to a variety X and let f:X  →  Y be a projective morphism to a variety Y. Let D be a Cartier divisor on Z such that [formula] for some ample [formula]-divisor H on X. Then we have Rif*Rjh*OZ(D) = 0 for every i > 0 and j  ≥  0.

Let us start the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3].

We take a natural finite double cover [formula] due to Kollár (see [\cite=fujino-slc]), which is étale in codimension one. Since [formula] is semi-log-canonical and OX(KX) is a direct summand of [formula], we may assume that the irreducible components of X have no self-intersection in codimension one by replacing (X,Δ) with [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=prop3.4], we can take a birational quasi-log resolution h:(Z,ΔZ)  →  X from a globally embedded simple normal crossing pair (Z,ΔZ) such that there exists a simple normal crossing divisor E on Z satisfying h*OZ(KZ + E)≃OX(KX). Note that KZ + E + h*L - (KZ + E) = h*L. Therefore, we obtain that

[formula]

for every i > 0 by Theorem [\ref=thm3.7].

If Δ = 0 in Theorem [\ref=thm1.3], then Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] follows from [\cite=fujino-slc]. Note that the formulation of [\cite=fujino-slc] seems to be more useful for some applications than the formulation of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3].

Let (X,Δ) be a semi-log-canonical Fano variety, that is, (X,Δ) is a projective semi-log-canonical pair such that - (KX  +  Δ) is ample (see [\cite=fujino-pull]). Then Hi(X,OX) = 0 for every i > 0 by [\cite=fujino-slc]. Unfortunately, this vanishing result for semi-log-canonical Fano varieties does not follow from Theorem [\ref=thm1.1]. See also Remark [\ref=rem3.10] below.

Let us prove Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] and Theorem [\ref=thm1.2].

Theorem [\ref=thm1.1] is a special case of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3]. By putting [formula] in Theorem [\ref=thm1.3], we obtain Theorem [\ref=thm1.1].

If (X,Δ) is log-canonical, then (X,Δ) is semi-log-canonical. Therefore, Theorem [\ref=thm1.2] is contained in Theorem [\ref=thm1.1].

As a direct easy application of Theorem [\ref=thm1.1], we have:

Let X be a stable variety, that is, X is a projective semi-log-canonical variety such that KX is ample. Then

[formula]

for every i > 0 and every positive integer m, where a is a positive integer such that aKX is Cartier.

Let X be a stable variety as in Corollary [\ref=cor3.9]. By [\cite=fujino-slc], we have already known that Hi(X,OX(mKX)) = 0 for every i > 0 and every positive integer m  ≥  2. This is an easy consequence of [\cite=fujino-slc].

Finally, we prove Corollary [\ref=cor1.4].

Since X is Cohen-Macaulay, we see that the vector space Hi(X,OX( - L)) is dual to Hdim X - i(X,OX(KX + L)) by Serre duality. Therefore, we have Hi(X,OX( - L)) = 0 for every i <  dim X by Theorem [\ref=thm1.1].

The approach to the Kodaira vanishing theorem explained in [\cite=kss] can not be directly applied to non-Cohen-Macaulay varieties. The above proof of Corollary [\ref=cor1.4] is different from the strategy in [\cite=kss].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.7]

In this final section, we just explain how to modify the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3] in order to obtain Theorem [\ref=thm1.7]. We do not explain a generalization of Theorem [\ref=thm3.7] for nef and log big divisors (see [\cite=fujino-foundation]), which is a main ingredient of the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.7] below.

Let us start the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.7].

Let [formula] be a natural finite double cover as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1.3]. Note that p*L is nef and log big over Y with respect to [formula]. Therefore, we may assume that the irreducible components of X have no self-intersection in codimension one by replacing (X,Δ) with [formula]. We take a birational quasi-log resolution h:(Z,ΔZ)  →  X as in Proposition [\ref=prop3.4]. Let E' be the divisor defined in Remark [\ref=rem3.5]. In this case, L is nef and log big over Y with respect to h:(Z,E')  →  X (see [\cite=fujino-foundation]). Then we obtain that

[formula]

for every i > 0 by [\cite=fujino-foundation] (see also [\cite=fujino-unpublished] and [\cite=fujino-fujisawa]). Note that KZ + E' + h*L - (KZ + E') = h*L and that the h-image of any stratum of (Z,E') is an slc stratum of (X,Δ) by construction (see Definition [\ref=def2.2]).

For the details of the vanishing theorem for nef and log big divisors and some related topics, see [\cite=fujino-foundation]. Note that [\cite=fujino-foundation] is a completely revised and expanded version of the author's unpublished manuscript [\cite=fujino-unpublished].

We strongly recommend the reader to see Theorem 1.10, Theorem 1.11, and Theorem 1.12 in [\cite=fujino-slc]. They are useful and powerful vanishing theorems for semi-log-canonical pairs related to Theorem [\ref=thm1.7].
