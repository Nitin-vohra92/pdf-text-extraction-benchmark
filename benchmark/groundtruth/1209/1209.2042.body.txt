Introduction

A fundamental result of Putcha (see [\cite=Put]) states that any linear algebraic semigroup S over an algebraically closed field k is strongly π-regular. The proof follows from the corresponding result for Mn(k) (essentially the Fitting decomposition), combined with the fact that S is isomorphic to a closed subsemigroup of Mn(k), for some n > 0. At the other extreme it is easy to see that any complete algebraic semigroup is strongly π-regular. It is therefore natural to ask whether any algebraic semigroup S is strongly π-regular. The purpose of this note is to provide an affirmative answer to this question, over an arbitrary field F; then the set S(F) of points of S over F is an abstract semigroup (we shall freely use the terminology and results of [\cite=Spr] for algebraic varieties defined over a field).

The Main Results

Let S be an algebraic semigroup defined over a subfield F of k. Then S(F) is strongly π-regular, that is for any x∈S(F), there exists a positive integer n and an idempotent e∈S(F) such that xn belongs to the unit group of eS(F)e.

We may replace S with any closed subsemigroup defined over F and containing some power of x. Denote by 〈x〉 the smallest closed subsemigroup of S containing x, that is, the closure of the subset {xm,m > 0}; then 〈x〉 is defined over F by [\cite=Spr]. The subsemigroups 〈xn〉, n  >  0, form a family of closed subsets of S, and satisfy [formula]. Thus, there exists a smallest such semigroup, say 〈xn0〉. Replacing x with xn0, we may assume that S  =  〈x〉  =  〈xn〉 for all n  >  0.

With the above notation and assumptions, xS is dense in S. Moreover, S is irreducible.

Since S  =  〈x2〉, the subset {xn,n  ≥  2} is dense in S. Hence xS is dense in S by an easy observation (Lemma [\ref=lem:dense]) that we will use repeatedly.

Let [formula] be the irreducible components of S. Then each xSi is contained in some component Sj. Since xS is dense in S, we see that xSi is dense in Sj. In particular, j is unique and the map σ:i  ↦  j is a permutation. By induction, xnSi is dense in Sσn(i) for all n and i; thus xnSi is dense in Si for some n and all i. Choose i such that xn∈Si. Then it follows that xmn∈Si for all m. Thus, 〈xn〉  ⊆  Si, and S  =  Si is irreducible.

Let S be an algebraic semigroup and let x∈S. Assume that S  =  〈x〉 (in particular, S is commutative), xS is dense in S, and S is irreducible. Then S is a monoid and x is invertible.

For y∈S, consider the decreasing sequence

[formula]

of closed, irreducible ideals of S. We claim that

[formula]

where d: =  dim (S)  +  1. Indeed, there exists n  ≤  d such that [formula], that is, yn + 1S is dense in [formula]. Multiplying by ym - n and using Lemma [\ref=lem:dense], it follows that ym + 1S is dense in [formula] for all m  ≥  n and hence for m  ≥  d. This proves the claim.

We may thus set

[formula]

Then we have for all y,z∈S,

[formula]

since yd(zdS)  =  (yz)dS  ⊆  zdS. Also, note that Ix  =  S, and Ie  =  eS for any idempotent e of S. By [\cite=Br], S has a smallest idempotent eS, and eSS is the smallest ideal of S. In particular, eSS  ⊆  Iy for all y. Define

[formula]

This is a set of closed, irreducible ideals, partially ordered by inclusion, with smallest element eSS and largest element S. If S  =  eSS, then S is a group and we are done. Otherwise, we may choose [formula] which covers eSS (since [formula] has minimal elements under inclusion). Consider

[formula]

If y,z∈T then [formula] and hence T is a subsemigroup of S. Also, note that [formula], since eSzI  ⊆  eSS is not dense in I for any z∈S. Furthermore x∈T. (Indeed, xS is dense in S and hence xydS is dense in [formula] for all y∈S. Thus, [formula] is dense in [formula]; in particular, xI is dense in I).

We now claim that

[formula]

Indeed, if y∈T then ydI is dense in I and hence not contained in eSS. Conversely, assume that [formula] and let z∈S such that I  =  Iz. Since [formula] and [formula], it follows that [formula] as I covers eSS.

By that claim, we have

[formula]

Hence [formula] is closed in S. Thus, T is an open subsemigroup of S; in particular, T is irreducible. Moreover, since x∈T and xS is dense in S, it follows that xT is dense in T; also note that {xn,n > 0} is dense in T.

Let eT∈T be the minimal idempotent, then eT∉eSS and hence the closed ideal eTS contains strictly eSS. Since both are irreducible, we have dim (eTT)  =   dim (eTS)  >   dim (eSS). Now the proof is completed by induction on κ(S): =  dim (S)  -   dim (eSS). Indeed, if κ(S)  =  0, then S  =  eSS is a group. In the general case, we have κ(T)  <  κ(S). By the induction assumption, T is a monoid and x is invertible in T. As T is dense in S, the neutral element of T is also neutral for S, and hence x is invertible in S.

By Lemmas [\ref=lem:semi] and [\ref=lem:mono], there exists n such that 〈xn〉 is a monoid defined over F, and xn is invertible in that monoid. To complete the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:main], it suffices to show that the neutral element e of 〈xn〉 is defined over F. For this, consider the morphism

[formula]

Then φ is the composition of the multiplication

[formula]

and of the left multiplication by xn; the latter is an automorphism of S, defined over F. So φ is defined over F as well, and the fiber Z: = φ- 1(xn) is isomorphic to μ- 1(e), hence to the unit group of S. In particular, Z is smooth. Moreover, Z contains (e,e), and the tangent map

[formula]

is surjective, since

[formula]

is just the addition. So Z is defined over F by [\cite=Spr]. But Z is sent to the point e by μ. Since that morphism is defined over F, so is e.

Let X be a topological space, and f:X  →  X a continuous map. If Y  ⊆  X is a dense subset then [formula] is a dense subset.

Let [formula] be a nonempty open subset. Then f- 1(U)  ⊆  X is open, and nonempty since f(X) is dense in [formula]. Hence [formula]. If [formula] then [formula]. Hence [formula].

Given x∈S, there exists a unique idempotent e  =  e(x)∈S such that xn belongs to the unit group of eSe for some n > 0. Indeed, we then have xnSxn  ⊆  eSe; moreover, since there exists y∈eSe such that xny  =  yxn  =  e, we also have eSe  =  xnySyxne  ⊆  xnSxn. Thus, xnSxn  =  eSe. It follows that xmnSxmn is a monoid with neutral element e for any m  >  0, which yields the desired uniqueness.

In particular, if x∈S(F) then the above idempotent e(x) is an F-point of the closed subsemigroup 〈x〉. We now give some details on the structure of the latter semigroup. For x,e,n as above, we have xn  =  exn  =  (ex)n, and y(ex)n  =  e for some y∈He (the unit group of e  〈x〉). But then ex∈He since (y(ex)n - 1)(ex)  =  e. Thus, exm  =  (ex)m∈He for all m  >  0. But if m  ≥  n then xm  =  exm. Thus, if x∉He then there exists an unique r  >  0 such that xr∉He and xm∈He for any m  >  r. In particular, xr∈e  〈x〉 for all m  ≥  r. Thus we can write

[formula]

for some s  <  r. Notice also that these xi's, with i  ≤  s, are all distinct (if xi  =  xj with 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  s, then xi  +  s  +  1  -  j  =  xs  +  1∈e  〈x〉, a contradiction). Moreover, a similar decomposition holds for the semigroup of F-rational points.

The set {exm,m  >  0} is dense in e  〈x〉 by Lemma [\ref=lem:dense]. But exm  =  (ex)m, and ex∈He. So e  〈x〉 is a unit-dense algebraic monoid. Furthermore, if 〈xm0〉 is the smallest subsemigroup of 〈x〉 of the form 〈xm〉, for some m > 0, then 〈xm0〉 is the neutral component of e  〈x〉 (the unique irreducible component containing e). Indeed, 〈xm0〉 is irreducible by Lemma [\ref=lem:semi], and ym0∈〈xm0〉 for any y∈〈x〉 in view of Lemma [\ref=lem:dense]. Thus, the unit group of 〈xm0〉 has finite index in the unit group of 〈x〉, and hence in that of e  〈x〉.

Finally, we show that Theorem [\ref=thm:main] is self-improving by obtaining the following stronger statement:

Let S be an algebraic semigroup. Then there exists n  >  0 (depending only on S) such that xn∈He(x) for all x∈S, where e:x  ↦  e(x) denotes the above map. Moreover, there exists a decomposition of S into finitely many disjoint locally closed subsets Uj such that the restriction of e to each Uj is a morphism.

We first show that for any irreducible subvariety X of S, there exists a dense open subset U of X and a positive integer n  =  n(U) such that xn∈He(x) for all x∈U, and e|U is a morphism. We will consider the semigroup S(k(X)) of points of S over the function field k(X), and view any such point as a rational map from X to S; the semigroup law on S(k(X)) is then given by pointwise multiplication of rational maps. In particular, the inclusion of X in S yields a point ξ∈S(k(X)) (the image of the generic point of X). By Theorem [\ref=thm:main], there exist a positive integer n and points e,y∈S(k(X)) such that e2  =  e, ξne  =  eξn  =  ξn, ye  =  ey  =  y and ξny  =  yξn  =  e. Let U be an open subset of X on which both rational maps e,y are defined. Then the above relations are equalities of morphisms U  →  S, where ξ is the inclusion. This yields the desired statements.

Next, start with an irreducible component X0 of S and let U0 be an open subset of X0 such that e|U0 is a morphism. Now let X1 be an irreducible component of [formula] and iterate this construction. This yields disjoint locally closed subsets [formula] such that e|Uj is a morphism for all j, and [formula] is closed for all j. Hence [formula] for j  ≫  0.
