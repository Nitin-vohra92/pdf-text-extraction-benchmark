Manifolds covered by lines and the Hartshorne Conjecture for quadratic manifolds

Introduction

The present paper is a natural sequel to our previous work, see [\cite=Ru] [\cite=IR] [\cite=IR2] and also [\cite=BI]. The geometry of the variety of lines passing through the general point of an embedded projective manifold is investigated, in the framework of Mori Theory. Our main results are a proof of the Hartshorne Conjecture on complete intersections for manifolds defined by quadratic equations and a description of all extremal cases.

We consider n-dimensional irreducible non-degenerate complex projective manifolds [formula]. We call X a prime Fano manifold of index i(X) if its Picard group is generated by the hyperplane section class H and - KX = i(X)H for some positive integer i(X). One consequence of Mori's work [\cite=Mori] is that, for [formula], X is covered by lines, i.e. through each point of X there passes a line, contained in X. As noticed classically, Fano complete intersections with [formula] are also covered by lines. The "biregular part" of Mori Theory (no singularities, no flips, ...), see [\cite=Mori2] [\cite=De] [\cite=Ko], provides the natural setting for studying manifolds covered by lines. For instance, as first noticed in [\cite=BSW], when the dimension of the variety of lines passing through a general point is at least [formula], there is a Mori contraction of the covering family of lines. Moreover, its general fiber (which is still covered by lines) has cyclic Picard group, thus being a prime Fano manifold. For prime Fanos, the study of covering families of lines is nothing but the classical aspect in the theory of the variety of minimal rational tangents, developed by Hwang and Mok in a remarkable series of papers, see e.g. [\cite=HM] [\cite=HM2] [\cite=HM3] [\cite=Hwang]. We also recall that lines contained in X play a key role in the proof of an important result due to Barth-Van de Ven and Hartshorne, cf. [\cite=Barth]. It states that X must be a complete intersection when its dimension is greater than a suitable (quadratic) function of its degree.

Prime Fanos of high index other than complete intersections are quite rare. Moreover, all known examples of prime Fanos of high index are either complete intersections or quadratic, i.e. scheme theoretically defined by quadratic equations. Mumford, [\cite=Mum], was the first to call the attention to the fact that many special but highly interesting embedded manifolds are quadratic. One crucial remark we made is that prime Fanos of high index are embedded with small codimension, which naturally leads us to the famous Hartshorne Conjecture, see [\cite=Ha]: if [formula], X should be a complete intersection. This conjecture is already very difficult even in the special case of (prime) Fano manifolds. Early contributions related to the conjecture came by with a topological flavor. First the celebrated Fulton-Hansen Connectivity Theorem [\cite=FH], followed by Zak's Linear Normality Theorem and his equally famous Theorem on Tangencies, see [\cite=Zak]. Then, the beautiful result of Faltings [\cite=Faltings], later improved by Netsvetaev [\cite=Net], showing that X is a complete intersection when the number of equations scheme theoretically defining it is small. Another development, suggested by classical work of Severi, is due to Bertram-Ein-Lazarsfeld [\cite=BEL]. They characterize complete intersections in terms of the degrees of the first c equations defining X (in decreasing order).

Consider now x∈X a general point and let Lx denote the variety of lines through x, contained in X. Note that Lx is naturally embedded in [formula] the space of tangent directions at x. Let a: =  dim (Lx) and note that for prime Fanos, i(X) = a + 2. When [formula], [formula] is smooth, irreducible and, due to a key result by Hwang [\cite=Hwang], non-degenerate. Our Theorem [\ref=schemeLxrefined], inspired by [\cite=BEL], shows that we can relate the equations of [formula] to those of [formula]. In particular, manifolds of small codimension and defined by equations of small degree are covered by lines; moreover, [formula] is a complete intersection if and only if [formula] is so and its codimension is the right one. In case X is quadratic, we combine the above with Faltings' Criterion [\cite=Faltings] to deduce that, when [formula], [formula] is a complete intersection. Next, we appeal to a different ingredient, leading to a proof of the Hartshorne Conjecture for quadratic manifolds, see Theorem [\ref=HaCo]. The necessary new piece of information is provided by the projective second fundamental form which, due to the Fulton-Hansen Connectivity Theorem, turns out to be of maximal dimension. We would like to point out that, working with local differential geometric methods, in the spirit of [\cite=GH] [\cite=IL], Landsberg in [\cite=Landsberg] proved that when [formula] a (possibly singular) quadratic variety X is a complete intersection, where b =  dim (Sing(X)).

Using Netsvetaev's Theorem [\cite=Net], we show that the only quadratic manifolds [formula] which are not complete intersections are [formula] and the spinorial manifold [formula], see our Theorem [\ref=HV].

Preliminaries

Setting, terminology and notation

Throughout the paper we consider [formula] an irreducible complex projective manifold of dimension [formula]. X is assumed to be non-degenerate and c denotes its codimension, so that N = n + c. We also suppose that X is scheme theoretically an intersection of m hypersurfaces of degrees [formula]. It is implicitly assumed that m is minimal, i.e. none of the hypersurfaces contains the intersection of the others. We put [formula]. [formula] is called quadratic if it is scheme theoretically an intersection of quadrics (i.e. d1 = 2). Note that this happens precisely when d = c.

For x∈X we let [formula] denote the (affine) Zariski tangent space to X at x, and write TxX for its projective closure in [formula]. H denotes a hyperplane section (class) of X. As usual, KX stands for the canonical class of X. Also, if Y  ⊂  X is a submanifold, we denote by NY / X its normal bundle. For a vector bundle E, [formula] stands for its projectivized bundle, using Grothendieck's convention.

We let [formula] be the secant variety of X, that is the closure of the locus of secant lines. The secant defect of X is the (nonnegative) number δ  =  δ(X): = 2n + 1 -  dim (SX). We say X is secant defective when δ  >  0.

[formula] is conic-connected if any two general points x,x'∈X are contained in some conic Cx,x'  ⊂  X. Conic-connected manifolds are secant defective. Classification results for conic-connected manifolds are obtained in [\cite=IR], working in the general setting of rationally connected manifolds.

For a general point x∈X, we denote by Lx the (possibly empty) scheme of lines contained in X and passing through x. We say that [formula] is covered by lines if Lx is not empty for x∈X a general point. We refer the reader to [\cite=De] [\cite=Ko] for standard useful facts about the deformation theory of rational curves; we shall use them implicitly in the simplest case, that is lines on X.

Recall that X is Fano if - KX is ample. The index of X, denoted by i(X), is the largest integer j such that - KX  =  jA for some ample divisor A.

The projective second fundamental form

We recall some general results which are probably well known to the experts but for which we are unable to provide a proper reference.

There are several possible equivalent definitions of the projective second fundamental form [formula] of an irreducible projective variety [formula] at a general point x∈X, see for example [\cite=IL]. We use the one related to tangential projections, as in [\cite=IL].

Suppose [formula] is non-degenerate, as always, let x∈X be a general point and consider the projection from TxX onto a disjoint [formula]

[formula]

The map πx is associated to the linear system of hyperplane sections cut out by hyperplanes containing TxX, or equivalently by the hyperplane sections singular at x.

Let [formula] be the blow-up of X at x, let

[formula]

be the exceptional divisor and let H be a hyperplane section of [formula]. The induced rational map [formula] is defined as a rational map along E since [formula] is not a linear space. The restriction of [formula] to E is given by a linear system in [formula].

The second fundamental form [formula] of an irreducible non-degenerate variety [formula] of dimension [formula] at a general point x∈X is the non-empty linear system of quadric hypersurfaces in [formula] defining the restriction of [formula] to E.

Clearly [formula] and [formula]. From this point of view the base locus on E of the second fundamental form |IIx,X| consists of asymptotic directions, i.e. of directions associated to lines having a contact of order at least three with X at x. For example, as we shall see, when [formula] is quadratic, the base locus of the second fundamental form consists of points representing tangent lines contained in X and passing through x, so that it is exactly (even scheme theoretically) Lx.

Let [formula] be a smooth irreducible non-degenerate variety of secant defect [formula]. Then dim (|IIx,X|) = c - 1 for x∈X a general point.

Let notation be as above. It is sufficient to show that [formula] because [formula] and [formula] is a non-degenerate variety, whose dimension is n - δ by the Terracini Lemma.

Let [formula] be the tangential variety of X. The following formula holds

[formula]

see [\cite=Terracini] (or [\cite=GH] and [\cite=IL] for a modern reference).

The variety [formula] is smooth and secant defective, so that TX = SX by a theorem of Fulton and Hansen, [\cite=FH]. Therefore dim (TX) = 2n + 1 - δ and from [\eqref=dimension] we get [formula], as claimed.

Manifolds covered by lines

Let [formula] be as in (*  ). The following examples of manifolds covered by lines are of relevance to us.

[formula] a Fano complete intersection with [formula].

(Mori) [formula] a Fano manifold with [formula] and [formula].

[formula] a conic-connected manifold, different from the Veronese variety [formula] or one of its isomorphic projections.

Fix some irreducible component, say F, of the Hilbert scheme of lines on [formula], such that X is covered by the lines in F. Put [formula] where ∈F. Note that [formula] and a =  dim (Fx), where x∈X is a general point and [formula]. Moreover, we may view Fx as a closed subscheme of [formula].

When the dimension of Fx is large, the study of manifolds covered by lines is greatly simplified by the following two facts:

First, we may reduce, via a Mori contraction, to the case where the Picard group is cyclic; this is due to Beltrametti-Sommese-Winiewski, see [\cite=BSW]. Secondly, the variety [formula] inherits many of the good properties of [formula]; this is due to Hwang, see [\cite=Hwang]. See [\cite=BI] for an application of these principles.

Assume [formula]. Then the following results hold:

([\cite=BSW]) There is a Mori contraction, say contF:X  →  W, of the lines from F; let F denote a general fiber of contF and let f be its dimension;

([\cite=Wisniewski]) [formula], i(F) = a + 2 and F is covered by the lines from F contained in F;

([\cite=Hwang]) [formula] is smooth irreducible non-degenerate. In particular, F has only one maximal irreducible covering family of lines.

The following very useful result was proved in [\cite=BEL]. It will play a crucial role in what follows.

Let [formula] be as in (*  ). If

[formula]

then [formula] is a complete intersection of type [formula].

Under our hypothesis

[formula]

Thus [formula] fails to be d-regular and we can apply [\cite=BEL].

Now we can prove the following theorem, showing that [formula] "behaves better" than [formula]. Indeed we can control the number of equations defining Lx, as in the classical Example [\ref=ex] (1), but without assuming X to be a complete intersection.

Let [formula] be as in (*  ). For x∈X a general point, put a =  dim (Lx). Then the following results hold:

If [formula] is nonempty, it is set theoretically defined by (at most) d equations; in particular, we have [formula].

If X is quadratic and [formula] is nonempty, Lx is scheme theoretically defined by (at most) c quadratic equations.

If [formula], then [formula]; assume moreover that [formula] if X is quadratic. Then

[formula] is a Fano manifold with [formula] and i(X) = a + 2;

the following conditions are equivalent:

[formula] is a complete intersection;

[formula] is a complete intersection of codimension d;

a = n - 1 - d.

Assume that [formula], [formula] and [formula] is a complete intersection. Then X is conic-connected, [formula] and [formula].

Let us take a closer look at the proof of the previous result given in [\cite=BEL]. Since [formula] is scheme theoretically defined by equations of degree [formula], we can choose [formula], [formula], such that, letting [formula], we obtain the complete intersection scheme

[formula]

where X' (if nonempty) meets X in a divisor.

Thus for x∈X general we have that a line l passing through x is contained in X  ⊆  Y if and only if l is contained in Y, that is [formula] coincides set theoretically with [formula]. Suppose, as recalled above, that

[formula]

with fi homogeneous polynomials of degree di and let x∈X be a general point. Without loss of generality we can suppose [formula]. Then in the affine space [formula] defined by x0  ≠  0, we have [formula], with fji homogeneous of degree j in the variables [formula], where [formula] for every [formula] and [formula]. The equations of [formula] inside [formula] are exactly [formula] while the equations of Lx(Y) inside [formula] are [formula], which are exactly [formula]. In particular [formula], if not empty, is set theoretically defined by these equations, proving (1).

To prove (2), assume that X is quadratic. Keeping the notation above, we see that [formula] is scheme theoretically defined by the equations [formula] (modulo the ideal generated by [formula]). But the same homogeneous quadratic equations define the affine scheme [formula]. In particular, the pointed affine cone over [formula] and the scheme [formula] coincide. Consider now, as above, [formula]. We have that the pointed affine cone over [formula] and the scheme [formula] coincide and are scheme theoretically defined by (at most) c quadratic equations. But X and Y coincide in a neighborhood of x, hence the pointed affine cones over Lx(X) and Lx(Y) also coincide. As Lx(X) is smooth, this implies that Lx(Y) is also smooth and so they coincide as schemes (see also [\cite=Rulines] for more details and for other proofs of this key result). This shows (2).

Under the hypothesis of (3), we deduce [formula]

The assertion about the Picard group in (a) follows from the Barth-Larsen Theorem, see [\cite=BL]. Since x∈X is general and since [formula] by the above argument, for every line l passing through x we have

[formula]

concluding the proof of (a).

To show (b), let us remark that by the previous discussion (i) implies (ii); (ii) implies (iii) is obvious. Theorem [\ref=criterion] shows that (iii) implies (i).

We now pass to part (4). Since [formula], [formula] is smooth irreducible and non-degenerate by Theorem [\ref=reduction] (3). As [formula] is a non-degenerate complete intersection of dimension greater or equal to one less its codimension, it follows from the Terracini Lemma that [formula], see e.g. [\cite=Russo]. Now we may apply [\cite=HK] to infer that X is conic-connected. In particular, we have δ(X) > 0. From Proposition [\ref=secondform] it follows that dim |IIx,X| = c - 1. As Lx is contained in the base-locus of |IIx,X|, it follows that Lx is contained in at least c linearly independent quadrics. But, being a complete intersection, the number of such quadrics can not exceed the codimension of Lx in [formula]. This means that [formula], which is what we wanted.

Around the Hartshorne Conjecture; the quadratic case

In [\cite=Ha], Hartshorne made his now famous conjecture:

If [formula] is as in (*  ) and [formula] then X is a complete intersection.

This is still widely open, even for c = 2. We would like to state explicitly several weaker versions.

Assume that [formula] and X is Fano; then X is a complete intersection.

Assume that [formula] is covered by lines with [formula] and let T be the span of Lx in [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] is a complete intersection.

When [formula], by the Barth-Larsen Theorem [formula]. In particular KX = bH for some integer b. So, saying that X is Fano means exactly that b  <  0; this happens, for instance, if X is covered by lines.

The (HCF) holds when c = 2, see [\cite=BC].

By Theorem [\ref=reduction], the (HCL) concerns Fano manifolds [formula] with [formula] and of index [formula].

Manifolds of (very) small degree are known to be complete intersections, cf. [\cite=Barth]. The (HCF) would yield the following optimal result, see [\cite=Io].

If [formula], then X is a complete intersection, unless it is projectively equivalent to [formula].

Note that the Segre embedding [formula] has degree n and is not a complete intersection if [formula].

Prime Fano manifolds of high index tend to be complete intersections. In the next proposition we propose such bounds on the index and show how they would follow from the (HC). However, we expect this kind of result to be easier to prove than the general (HC).

Let [formula] be a Fano manifold with [formula] and of index [formula]. If the (HCL) and the (HCF) are true, then X is a complete intersection.

The same conclusion holds assuming only the (HCF), but asking instead that [formula].

(1) Since [formula] we get that X is covered by lines by Example [\ref=ex] (2). We have [formula], hence [formula] is smooth irreducible non-degenerate by Theorem [\ref=reduction] (3). Moreover, we have [formula]. Thus [formula] is a complete intersection by the (HCL). Next we may apply Theorem [\ref=schemeLxrefined] (4) to infer that [formula] and then use the (HCF).

(2) Since [formula] we have that X is conic-connected by [\cite=HK]. From [\cite=IR] we infer

[formula]

This yields [formula] so that [formula] by Zak's Linear Normality Theorem. Therefore δ = n - c + 1 and

[formula]

implies [formula], so the (HCF) applies.

Note that for complete intersections [formula], [formula] is also a complete intersection. We believe that for manifolds covered by lines the converse should also hold.

If [formula] is covered by lines and [formula] is a (say smooth irreducible non-degenerate) complete intersection, then X is a complete intersection too.

Theorem [\ref=schemeLxrefined] (4) shows that the above conjecture follows from the (HCF), at least when [formula].

Mumford in his seminal series of lectures [\cite=Mum] called the attention to the fact that many interesting embedded manifolds are scheme theoretically defined by quadratic equations.

As a special case of the results in [\cite=BEL], if X is quadratic, we have:

If [formula], then X is projectively normal;

If [formula], then X is projectively Cohen-Macaulay.

Our main results are:

Assume that [formula] is as in (*  ) and X is quadratic.

If [formula], then X is Fano.

If [formula], then X is covered by lines. Moreover, [formula] is scheme theoretically defined by c independent quadratic equations.

If [formula], then the following conditions are equivalent:

[formula] is a complete intersection;

[formula] is a complete intersection;

dim (Lx) = n - 1 - c;

(HC) If [formula], then X is a complete intersection.

If [formula] and X is Fano of index [formula], then X is a complete intersection.

We use the notation in (*  ). Moreover, denote by a: =  dim (Lx). Since X is quadratic, we have d = c.

Since X is quadratic, [formula] is spanned by global sections. Therefore, [formula] is also spanned and [formula] is ample. From [formula] it follows that [formula]. We get the ampleness of [formula], thus proving (1).

From Theorem [\ref=schemeLxrefined] (3) and (2) we deduce the first part in (2) and that [formula] is defined scheme theoretically by at most c quadratic equations. Since [formula], we must have [formula]. From Proposition [\ref=secondform] we infer that the quadratic equations defining Lx are independent, proving (2). This also shows that, when Lx is a complete intersection, it has codimension c in [formula]. From Theorem [\ref=schemeLxrefined] (3) the equivalence between conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of part (3) is now clear.

To prove part (4), assume that [formula]. We first observe that by Theorem [\ref=schemeLxrefined] (1) we have [formula]. Next, since [formula], [formula] by [\cite=BL]. From Theorem [\ref=reduction](3) [formula] is smooth irreducible and non-degenerate. Being defined scheme theoretically by [formula] equations, it is a complete intersection by the result of Faltings [\cite=Faltings]. By the previous point X is a complete intersection, too.

Finally, part (5) follows from part (4) and Proposition [\ref=index].

Assume that [formula] is as in (*  ) and X is quadratic. If n = 2c and X is not a complete intersection, then it is projectively equivalent to one of the following:

[formula], or

[formula].

We need a refinement of Faltings' Theorem from [\cite=Faltings], due to Netsvetaev, see [\cite=Net]. Since we assumed that X is not a complete intersection, we have [formula], so [formula] is smooth irreducible non-degenerate by Theorem [\ref=reduction] (3). Moreover, by the previous theorem, Lx is not a complete intersection in [formula], but it is scheme theoretically defined by c independent quadratic equations. Netsvetaev's Theorem from [\cite=Net] applied to [formula] gives the inequalities

[formula]

We may assume [formula] (otherwise Lx is a complete intersection), so we deduce that n = 4r + 2 and a = 3r, for a suitable r. If r  >  2 (equivalently n  >  10), we would have [formula] and Lx would be a complete intersection by Theorem [\ref=HaCo] (4). In conclusion n = 6 or n = 10. In the first case i(X) = a + 2 = 5 and we get case (a) by the classification of del Pezzo manifolds, see [\cite=Fujita]. In the second case, i(X) = 8, leading to case (b) by [\cite=Mukai].

If [formula] is not a complete intersection, it is called a Hartshorne manifold. [formula] and [formula] are such examples, the first one being due to Hartshorne himself. So, for quadratic manifolds we proved not only that the (HC) holds, but also that the above examples are the only Hartshorne manifolds. This shows, once again, how mysterious the general case of the (HC) remains!

Working with local differential geometric techniques, as in [\cite=GH] [\cite=IL], Landsberg [\cite=Landsberg] proved that a (possibly singular) quadratic variety satisfying [formula] is a complete intersection, where [formula].
