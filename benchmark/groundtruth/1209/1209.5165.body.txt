The action of pseudo-differential operator s on functions harmonic outside a smooth hyper-surface

The goal of this note is to describe the action of pseudo-differential operator s on the space H of L2 functions which are harmonic outside a smooth closed hyper-surface Z of a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary (X,g) and whose traces from both sides of Z coïncide. We will represent these L2 harmonic functions as harmonic extensions of functions in the Sobolev space H- 1 / 2(Z) by a Poisson operator P. The main result says that, if A is a pseudo-differential operator  of degree d < 3, the operator

[formula]

is a pseudo-differential operator  on Z of degree d - 1 whose principal symbol of degree d - 1 can be computed by integration of the principal symbol of A on the co-normal bundle of Z.

These "bilateral" extensions are simpler (at least for the Laplace operator) than the "unilateral" ones whose study is the theory of pseudo-differential operator s on manifolds with boundary (see [\cite=Cal] [\cite=LBM1] [\cite=LBM2] [\cite=Grub] [\cite=Taylor]).

Symbols

The following classes of symbols are defined in the books [\cite=Grub], sec. 7.1, and in [\cite=Ho], sec. 18.1. A symbol of degree d on [formula] where U is an open set in [formula] is a smooth complex valued function a(x,ξ) on [formula] which satisfies the following estimates: for any multi-indices (α,β), there exists a constant Cα,β so that

[formula]

The symbol a is called classical if a admits an expansion [formula] where aj is homogeneous of degree j (j an integer) for [formula] large enough; more precisely, for any [formula], [formula] is a symbol of degree d - J - 1.

We will need the

If a(x;ξ,η) is a symbol of degree d <  - 1 defined on [formula], [formula] is a symbol of degree d + 1 defined on [formula]. Moreover, if a is classical, b is also classical and the homogeneous components of b are given for l  ≤  d + 1, by [formula]

A general reduction Theorem for pseudo-differential operator s

We choose local coordinates in some neighborhood of a point in Z denoted [formula], so that Z = {y = 0}. We denote by [formula] a finite cover of Z by such charts and denote by Ω0 an open set disjoint from Z so that [formula]. We choose the charts Ωj so that the densities |dz| and |dx| are the Lebesgue measures.

If X is a smooth manifold, we denote by D'(X) the space of generalized functions on X of which the space of smooth functions on X is a dense subspace. We assume that X and Z are equipped with smooth densities |dx| and |dz|. This allows to identify generalized functions with Schwartz distributions, i.e. linear functionals on test functions; this duality extending the L2 product is denoted by 〈|〉. We introduce the extension operator E:D'(Z)  →  D'(X) sending the distribution f to the distribution fδ(y = 0) defined

[formula]

and its adjoint, the trace T:C∞(X)  →  C∞(Z) defined by φ  →  φ|Z. Let A be a pseudo-differential operator   on X: let us call Aj the restriction of A to test functions compactly supported in Ωj. We will work with one of the Aj's given by the following "quantization" rule

[formula]

So we have formally, using the facts that the densities on X and Z are given by the Lebesgue measures in these local coordinates:

[formula]

which we can rewrite

[formula]

with

[formula]

We have the This is proved by looking at the actions on test functions compactly supported in the chart Ωj, ~ j  ≥  1: then we use Lemma [\ref=lemm:intsymb].

The principal symbol can be described in a more intrinsic way: let z∈Z be given, from the smooth densities on TzX and on TzZ given by |dx| and |dz|, we get, using the Liouville densities, densities on the dual bundles [formula] and [formula]. Let us denote by Ω1(E) the 1-dimensional space of densities on the vector space E. From the exact sequence

[formula]

we deduce

[formula]

and a canonical density dm(z) in [formula]. The principal symbol of [formula] is given in coordinates by [formula].

The "bilateral" Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator

We will assume that the local coordinates x = (z,y) along Z are chosen so that g(z,0) = h(dz) + dy2 and the Riemannian volume along Z is |dx|g = |dz|h|dy|. We will choose the associated densities on X and Z. We will denote by Δg the Laplace-Beltrami operator on (X,g) as defined by Riemannian geometers (i.e. with a minus sign in front of the second order derivatives).

If f is given on Z, let us denote by DN(f) minus the sum of the interior normal derivatives on both sides of Z of the harmonic extension F of f; this always makes sense, even if the normal bundle of Z is not orientable. We have the

The distributional Laplacian of the harmonic extension F of a smooth function f on Z is ΔgF = E(DN(f)).

Denoting by Δ- 1g the "quasi-inverse" of Δg defined by Δ- 1gφj  =  λ- 1jφj for the eigenfunctions φj of Δg with non-zero eigenvalue λj and Δ- 1g1 = 0, we have [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=theo:main], the operator [formula] is an elliptic self-adjoint pseudo-differential operator  on Z. The operator DN is a right inverse of B modulo smoothing operators and hence also a left inverse modulo smoothing operators. So that DN = B- 1 is an elliptic self-adjoint of principal symbol the inverse

[formula]

namely [formula]. Hence The full symbol of DN can be computed in a similar way from the full symbol of the resolvent Δ- 1g along Z.

The Poisson operator

Let A be an pseudo-differential operator  on X of principal symbol a. We are interested to the restriction to the space H of the quadratic form QA(F) = 〈AF|F〉 associated to A. We will parametrize H as harmonic extensions of functions which are in [formula] by the so-called Poisson operator denoted by P; the pull-back RA of QA on L2(Z) is defined by

[formula]

The goal of this section is to compute the operator [formula] associated to the quadratic form RA.

From Lemma [\ref=lemm:harm-ext], we have, modulo smoothing operators,

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

The operator [formula] is a pseudo-differential operator  of principal symbol [formula] near Z.

Applying Theorem [\ref=theo:main] to the inner bracket and Theorem [\ref=theo:dn], we get the:

Note that if A is a pseudo-differential operator without the transmission property, the operator [formula] may be ill-behaved and have disagreeable singularities along Z; however P*AP is always a good pseudo-differential operator on Z.
