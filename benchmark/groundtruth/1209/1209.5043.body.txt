Deloopings of the spaces of long embeddings

Introduction

Let Ed = Edn,j (resp. Id = Idn,j) be the space of long j-embeddings (resp.  long j-immersions) in [formula], that is, smooth embeddings [formula] (resp. immersions [formula]) such that [formula] if |x|  ≥  1. Here "d" indicates that we are considering differentiable maps. We also consider the space [formula] ([formula]) of framed long embeddings (immersions) [formula]. Budney [\cite=Budney03] defined an action of little (j + 1)-disks operad [formula] on (a space equivalent to) [formula]. Consequently [formula] (n - j  ≥  3) turns out to be weakly equivalent to a (j + 1)-fold loop space by the loop space recognition principle [\cite=May271]. Budney's [formula]-action also applies to [formula] in such a way that the inclusion [formula] is a map of [formula]-spaces. Thus the space [formula], the homotopy fiber of [formula] (or equivalently of Edn,j  →  Idn,j), is also a [formula]-space and hence a (j + 1)-fold loop space if n - j  ≥  3 (this argument is the same as the proof of [\cite=Turchin10]). Sinha [\cite=Sinha04] also proved that [formula] (n  ≥  4) is weakly equivalent to a double loop space, using a cosimplicial method. Based on Sinha's work, Salvatore [\cite=Salvatore06] showed that Edn,1 (n  ≥  4) is weakly equivalent to a double loop space with double loop maps [formula] and [formula].

A natural question is; what is the delooping of [formula] (and of [formula])? Dwyer-Hess [\cite=DwyerHess10] and Tourtchine [\cite=Tourtchine10] independently described a delooping of [formula] (n  ≥  4) as the derived space of maps between some operads. The purpose of this paper is to give a simple delooping of [formula] which had already appeared implicitly in Lashof's paper [\cite=Lashof76].

If n - j  ≥  3 and n  ≥  5, then [formula] is weakly equivalent to the (j + 1)-fold based loop space of the topological Stiefel manifold Vtn,j.

The topological Stiefel manifold Vtn,j ("t" suggests that it consists of topological maps) is defined to be the orbit space [formula], where [formula] is the topological group of germs at [formula] of homeomorphisms [formula] which restrict to the identity on [formula], and [formula]. Though Vtn,j is not a manifold in the usual sense, we follow the classical terminology.

Since the orthogonal group acts in a nontrivial way on the topological Stiefel manifold, a possibly nontrivial BV-structure on [formula] is deduced by [\cite=SalvatoreWahl03] in a range of dimensions.

If n - j  ≥  3, n  ≥  5 and n  ≥  2j + 1, then [formula] is weakly equivalent to a space on which the framed (j + 1)-disks operad j + 1 acts in a nontrivial way. Consequently [formula] is a [formula]-algebra [\cite=SalvatoreWahl03].

It is well known, though not so frequently mentioned, that Edn,j (n - j  ≥  3) is weakly equivalent to a j-fold loop space, because π0Edn,j is a group if n - j  ≥  3 [\cite=Haefliger66] and [formula] acts on Edn,j in a similar fashion to the case of j-fold based loop spaces. We can also describe a delooping of Edn,j.

If n - j  ≥  3 and n  ≥  5, then Edn,j is weakly equivalent to ΩjVt / dn,j, where Vt / dn,j is the homotopy fiber of the natural inclusion from the (usual) Stiefel manifold Vdn,j = O(n) / O(n - j) to Vtn,j.

The delooping in Proposition [\ref=prop:deloop_unframed] can be seen as a "positive codimension version" of Morlet-Burghelea-Lashof's delooping of the diffeomorphism group Diff(Dn,∂) = Edn,n of the disk relative to the boundary [\cite=BurgheleaLashof74-1] [\cite=Morlet69];

[formula]

Indeed [\eqref=eq:MBL] can be written as Edn,n  ~  ΩnVt / dn,n, since [formula], O(n) = Vdn,n, and [formula] is a fiber bundle [\cite=Gleason50] and hence a Serre fibration.

The proof of the following is similar to that of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV].

If n - j  ≥  3 and n  ≥  5, then Edn,j is weakly equivalent to a space on which j acts in a nontrivial way. Consequently [formula] is a [formula]-algebra.

Proposition [\ref=prop:deloop_unframed] gives rise to an alternative proof of the useful fact which was proved in [\cite=Budney08] by means of a spinning method (in a wider range of dimensions). In fact the isomorphism in Corollary [\ref=cor:spinning] below coincides with that given in [\cite=Budney08].

If n - j  ≥  3 and n  ≥  5, then [formula] for k  ≤  2(n - j) - 5.

Here we mention some possible advantages of our delooping of [formula].

First, we might be able to describe the (co)homology of [formula] in terms of that of Vt, and possibly BV-algebra structure from Corollaries [\ref=cor:BV] and [\ref=cor:BV_unframed] might produce new homology classes of [formula] (see also §[\ref=s:Q], Question [\ref=q3]). The author indeed proved in [\cite=K08] [\cite=K09] that the Browder operation induced by Budney's [formula]-action [\cite=Budney03] yields a nontrivial homology class of [formula] for odd n  ≥  3 (see [\cite=Longoni04] for a similar result). In fact this homology class can also be obtained by using the BV-operator introduced in [\cite=K10] arising from Hatcher's cycle [\cite=Hatcher99]. It would be an interesting question to determine, using H*(Vt), the generating set of [formula] as a BV-algebra.

Second, the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:spinning] does not require the celebrated "Goodwillie calculus" as in [\cite=Budney08]. Instead we need the knowledge of the homotopy groups of Vtn,j [\cite=Lashof76] [\cite=Millett75]. So far many interesting results on the (homology of) embedding spaces have been obtained by means of Goodwillie calculus (see for example [\cite=AroneLambrechtsVolic07] [\cite=LambrechtsTurchinVolic10] and the papers already referred above). Perhaps we might be able to give alternative proofs for some of these results using Vtn,j as in Corollary [\ref=cor:spinning], and if this is the case, it would be curious to compare these two methods.

In §[\ref=s:proof] we prove the above results. In §[\ref=s:Q] some related questions are listed.

Proofs

Let Et = Etn,j and It = Itn,j be the spaces of locally flat topological long embeddings and immersions [formula] respectively. Let Et / d = Et / dn,j and It / d = It / dn,j be the homotopy fibers of the inclusions Ed  →  Et and Id  →  It respectively.

If n - j  ≥  3 and n  ≥  5, then the map Et / dn,j  →  It / dn,j is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Theorem [\ref=thm:Lashof] was stated in [\cite=Lashof76] in terms of simplicial sets. As mentioned in [\cite=Lashof76], by a work of ernavski [\cite=Cernavskii69], the simplicial sets of locally flat topological embeddings or immersions used in [\cite=Lashof76] are homotopy equivalent to the singular complexes of our space Etn,j or Itn,j if the conditions on n and j are satisfied. Therefore we always assume n - j  ≥  3 and n  ≥  5 throughout this paper.

Consider the following commutative diagram consisting of six fibration sequences;

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the homotopy fiber of E*  →  I*, *  = d, t, t / d. Since by Theorem [\ref=thm:Lashof] the map (a) in [\eqref=eq:diagram] is a weak equivalence, [formula] is weakly contractible and hence [formula] is a weak equivalence.

On the other hand, since Et is contractible by the Alexander trick ([\cite=Lashof76]), [formula] is a homotopy equivalence. Theorem [\ref=thm:main] follows from Lees' topological Smale-Hirsch theorem [formula] [\cite=Lees69].

In fact Lees' theorem [\cite=Lees69] asserts that there exists a weak equivalence from the space [formula] of topological framed long immersions [formula] to [formula], which equivalence fits into the following diagram of fibration sequences;

[formula]

Thus we have [formula] (on the component containing the base point).

The above proof works even if the spaces of topological maps are replaced by those of piecewise-linear (PL) maps. In this case the proof relies on Haefliger-Poenaru's theorem [formula] [\cite=HaefligerPoenaru64] (the space of locally flat PL immersions and the PL Stiefel manifold VPL are defined analogously to the topological case). If n - j  ≥  3, then VPLn,j  →  Vtn,j is a homotopy equivalence by [\cite=Lashof76], and hence VPL may replace Vt.

As noted in [\cite=Lashof76], there is a fibration sequence

[formula]

This is because we can deduce a weak equivalence [formula] which makes [\eqref=eq:diagram] homotopy commutative, using Theorem [\ref=thm:Lashof] and the fact that Et is contractible.

The weak equivalences I*n,j  →  ΩjV*n,j (*  = d,t) are both given as taking the germs of the long immersions. Thus Idn,j  →  Itn,j is equivalent to the j-fold loop map of Vdn,j  →  Vtn,j and hence the fiber Ed is equivalent to ΩjVt / dn,j.

As explained in [\cite=SalvatoreWahl03], the [formula]-action on a (j + 1)-fold based loop space Ωj + 1X can be extended to that of j + 1 by using a basepoint-preserving action of SO(j + 1) on X (Ωj + 1X is then acted on by SO(j + 1) by the conjugation). Thus we need a (nontrivial) action of SO(j + 1) on Vtn,j which preserves the basepoint; the orbit of [formula]. One of the easiest choices is the restriction of the conjugation of [formula] on [formula] (see Remark [\ref=rem:action] below), which descends to a basepoint-preserving action on Vtn,j since it preserves [formula]. If n - j  ≥  j + 1, this action restricts to that of SO(j + 1).

The [formula]-structure on [formula] is a consequence of the j + 1-action [\cite=SalvatoreWahl03]. The weak equivalence [formula] implies [formula] and this completes the proof.

One of the reasons why we chose the conjugation in the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV] is that it seems meaningful from the viewpoint of immersions; for example, we can define an action SO(j)  ×  V*n,j  →  V*n,j (*  = d,t) as the conjugation [formula], here V*n,j is regarded as the space of germs at [formula] of (smooth or topological) embeddings [formula]. Under the Smale-Hirsch/Lees equivalence [formula], the induced action of SO(j) on ΩjV*n,j by conjugation corresponds to the natural conjugation action of SO(j) on long immersions I*n,j. This action seems meaningful since it would produce new immersions via "spinning", and can be used for the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV_unframed]. However in the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV] we adopted SO(n - j) instead of SO(j) as the space acting on V*n,j, because the action explained here unfortunately does not extend to that of SO(j + 1). But the action in Corollary [\ref=cor:BV] may also be meaningful, because it "rotates" embeddings in the orthonormal direction [formula] and looks similar to the "Gramain cycle" [\cite=Gramain77] [\cite=Budney10]. At present the author does not know whether the action given in the proof of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV] yields a nontrivial BV-operation on [formula], nor whether there are other significant actions.

The proof is similar to that of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV], but in this case, as explained in Remark [\ref=rem:action], we may use the conjugation SO(j)  ×  V*n,j  →  V*n,j given by [formula] (*  = d,t) which preserves the basepoints ∈V*n,j (this action requires no dimension assumptions). Since Vdn,j  →  Vtn,j is SO(j)-equivariant under the conjugation, SO(j) also acts on the homotopy fiber Vt / dn,j preserving the basepoint, the constant path at ∈Vtn,j. The weak equivalence [formula] induces an isomorphism on homology.

Using Haefliger-Millett's theorem [\cite=Millett75], Lashof proved in [\cite=Lashof76] that, when n - j  ≥  3 and m  ≤  2n - j - 5, there is an isomorphism

[formula]

where Gq is the space of degree one maps Sq - 1  →  Sq - 1 and G is its stable suspension (see [\cite=Haefliger66]). On the other hand, by Haefliger's classification theorem [\cite=Haefliger66],

[formula]

for q  ≥  3. Proposition [\ref=prop:deloop_unframed] and the isomorphisms [\eqref=eq:HaefligerMillett] and [\eqref=eq:Haefliger] deduce

[formula]

for n - j  ≥  3 and j  ≤  m  ≤  2n - j - 5. Putting k = m - j completes the proof.

Questions

In [\cite=Budney03] [\cite=BudneyCohen05] the space Ed3,1 is proved to be a free [formula]-object, and hence [formula] is a free Poisson algebra [\cite=Cohen533]. An analogous result for [formula] for general n,j (n - j  ≥  3) would be derived if the answer of the following question is affirmative.

Is Vtn,j a (j + 1)-fold suspension?

Salvatore proved in [\cite=Salvatore06] that Edn,1 (n  ≥  4) is weakly equivalent to a double loop space. The following question asks whether the similar result holds for general n,j.

Is Vt / dn,j a based loop space with any (j + 1)-fold loop map ΩjVt / dn,j  →  Ωj + 1Vtn,j?

How do the BV-structures of Corollary [\ref=cor:BV] and of [\cite=K10] relate to each other? Do they produce any new operation other than cycles of Gramain [\cite=Gramain77] and Hatcher [\cite=Hatcher99]?
