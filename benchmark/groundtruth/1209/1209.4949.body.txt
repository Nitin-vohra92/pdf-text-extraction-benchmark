Introduction

Let [formula] be the set of n  ×  n complex matrices. For any [formula], A* stands for the conjugate transpose of A. [formula] is accretive-dissipative if it can be written as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are both (Hermitian) positive definite. Conformally partition A,B,C as

[formula]

such that all diagonal blocks are square. Say k and l (k,l > 0 and k + l = n) the order of A11 and A22, respectively, and let m =  min {k,l}. If A is positive definite and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]), then the famous Fischer determinantal inequality (FDI) [\cite=HJ85] states that

[formula]

Determinantal inequalities for accretive-dissipative matrices were first investigated by Ikramov [\cite=Ikr04], who obtained:

Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]). Then

[formula]

A reverse direction to that of Theorem [\ref=th1] has been given in [\cite=Lin12b]. We call this kind of inequalities the Fischer type determinantal inequality for accretive-dissipative matrices. In this paper, we intend to give an improvement of ([\ref=ikramov-det]). Our main result can be stated as

Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]). Then

[formula]

where [formula]

As a < 3m, it is clear that Theorem [\ref=th2] improves Theorem [\ref=th1]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=th2] is given in Section 3.

Auxiliary results

In this section, we present some lemmas that are needed in the proof of our main result.

[\cite=GI05] Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]). Then A / A11: = A22 - A21A- 111A12, the Schur complement of A11 in A, is also accretive-dissipative.

[\cite=Ikr04] Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative as in ([\ref=e0]). Then A- 1 = E - iF with E = (B + CB- 1C)- 1 and F = (C + BC- 1B)- 1.

[\cite=Zhan96] Let [formula] be Hermitian and assume B is positive definite. Then

[formula]

Here we adopt the convention that, for two Hermitian matrices X,Y of the same size, X > (  ≥  )Y means X - Y is positive (semi)definite. Of course, we do not distinguish Y < (  ≤  )X from X > (  ≥  )Y.

Let [formula] be positive semidefinite. Then

[formula]

The first inequality follows from [\cite=Zhan00] while the second one follows from [\cite=BK09]. Here we provide a direct proof of ([\ref=e3]) for the convenience of readers. We may assume B is positive definite, the general case is by a continuity argument. Let λj, [formula], be the eigenvalues of B- 1 / 2CB- 1 / 2, where B1 / 2 means the unique positive definite square root of B. Then

[formula]

Also, we denote the identity matrix by I.

Compute

[formula]

This proves the first inequality. To show the other, compute

[formula]

Main results

Theorem [\ref=th2] follows from the next two theorems.

Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]). Then

[formula]

Compute

[formula]

Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]). Then

[formula]

We have, by Lemma [\ref=lem2], that

[formula]

with

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem3] and the operator reverse monotonicity of the inverse, we get

[formula]

Setting A / A11 = R + iS with R = R* and S = S*. By Lemma [\ref=lem1], we know R and S are positive definite. A calculation shows

[formula]

It can be verified that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

As B,C are positive definite, we also have

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we assume m = l. Compute

[formula]

The proof is complete by noting [formula].

It is natural to ask whether a in ([\ref=lin-det]) can be replaced by a smaller number? There is evidence that the following could hold:

Let [formula] be accretive-dissipative and partitioned as in ([\ref=e1]). Then

[formula]

We end the paper by an example showing that if the above conjecture is true, then the factor 2m is optimal.

Let [formula] with ε > 0. Then A is accretive-dissipative. As ε  →  0+, we have

[formula]
