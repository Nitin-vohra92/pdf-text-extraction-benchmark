Genome-wide analysis points to roles for extracellular matrix remodeling, the visual cycle, and neuronal development in myopia

Author Summary

The genetic basis of myopia, or nearsightedness, is believed to be complex and affected by multiple genes. Two genetic association studies have each identified a single genetic region associated with myopia in European populations. Here we report the results of the largest ever genetic association study on myopia in over 40,000 people of European ancestry. We identified 19 genetic regions significantly associated with myopia age of onset. Two are replications of the previously identified associations, and 17 are novel. Thirteen of the novel associations are in or near genes implicated in eye development, neuronal development and signaling, the visual cycle of the retina, and general morphology: DLG2, KCNMA1, KCNQ5, LAMA2, LRRC4C, PRSS56, RBFOX1, RDH5, RGR, SFRP1, TJP2, ZBTB38, and ZIC2. These findings point to numerous biological pathways involved in the development of myopia, and in particular, suggest that early eye and neuronal development may lead to the eventual development of myopia in humans.

Introduction

Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the most common eye disorder worldwide. In the United States, an estimated 30-40% of the adult population has clinically relevant myopia (more severe than -1 diopter), and the prevalence has increased markedly in the last 30 years [\cite=pmid20008719] [\cite=pmid15078666]. Myopia is a refractive error that results primarily from increased axial length of the eye [\cite=pmid21155761]. The increased physical length of the eye relative to optical length causes images to be focused in front of the retina, resulting in blurred vision.

The etiology of myopia is multifactorial [\cite=pmid21155761]. Briefly, postnatal eye growth is directed by visual stimuli that evoke a signaling cascade within the eye. This cascade is initiated in the retina and passes through the choroid to guide remodeling of the sclera (the white part of the eye) (cf. [\cite=pmid16079001] [\cite=pmid16202407]). Animal models implicate these visually-guided alterations of the scleral extracellular matrix in the eventual development of myopia. [\cite=pmid7610579] [\cite=pmid16079001].

In humans the eye typically grows about 5 mm from birth to age six, during which time vision typically improves [\cite=pmid8631638]. At age six only about 2% of children are myopic [\cite=pmid8631638]. Although the eye grows only 0.5 mm through puberty [\cite=pmid7136552], the incidence of myopia increases sevenfold [\cite=pmid8631638], peaking between the ages 9-14 [\cite=pmid15037570]. Myopia developed during childhood or early adolescence generally worsens throughout adolescence and then stabilizes by age 20. Compared to myopia that develops in childhood or adolescence, adult onset myopia tends to be less severe [\cite=pmid8751115] [\cite=pmid19353396] [\cite=pmid14977519].

Although epidemiological studies have implicated numerous environmental factors in the development of myopia, most notably education, outdoor exposure, reading, and near work [\cite=pmid21155761], it is well established that genetics plays a substantial role. Twin and sibling studies have provided heritability estimates that range from 50% to over 90% [\cite=pmid11328732] [\cite=pmid11734523] [\cite=pmid1937488] [\cite=pmid15851555] [\cite=pmid17724179]. Children of myopic parents tend to have longer eyes and are at increased risk of developing myopia in childhood [\cite=pmid8728496]. Segregation analyses suggest that multiple genes are involved in the development of myopia [\cite=pmid15671267] [\cite=pmid4029963]. To date, there have been seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on myopia or related phenotypes (pathological myopia, refractive index, and ocular axial length): two in Europeans [\cite=pmid20835239] [\cite=pmid20835236] and five in Asian populations [\cite=pmid21095009] [\cite=pmid19779542] [\cite=pmid21505071] [\cite=pmid21640322] [\cite=pmid22685421]. Each of these publications has identified a different single association with myopia. In addition there have been several linkage studies (see [\cite=pmid17210850] [\cite=pmid21155761] for reviews) and an exome sequencing study of severe myopia [\cite=pmid21695231].

In contrast to the previous relatively small (up to approximately 5,000 initial cases) GWAS that used degree of refractive error as a quantitative dependent measure, we analyzed data for 43,360 individuals from the 23andMe database who reported whether they had been diagnosed with nearsightedness, and if so, at what age. We performed a genome-wide survival analysis on age of onset of myopia, discovering 19 genome-wide significant associations with myopia age of onset, 17 of which are novel.

Results and Discussion

Participants reported via a web-based questionnaire whether they had been diagnosed with nearsightedness, and if so, at what age. All participants were customers of 23andMe and of primarily European ancestry; no pair was more closely related than at the level of first cousins. We performed a genome-wide survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model on 43,360 individuals ("discovery set"). This model assumes that there is an (unknown) baseline probability of developing myopia at every year of age. The model then tests whether each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with a significantly higher or lower probability of developing myopia compared to baseline. The Cox model can be thought of as a generalization of an analysis of myopia age of onset. In contrast to an analysis of age of onset, the Cox model allows for the inclusion of non-myopic controls, resulting in considerably increased statistical power. Analyses controlled for sex and five principal components of genetic ancestry. An additional, non-overlapping set of 4,277 participants who answered a separate question about their use of corrective eyewear for nearsightedness before the age of ten were used as a replication set. See Table [\ref=tab:tab1] for characteristics of the two cohorts.

Table [\ref=tab:tab2] shows the top SNPs for all 27 genetic regions associated with myopia with a p-value smaller than 10- 6. All p-values from the GWAS have been corrected for the inflation factor of 1.14. A total of 19 of the SNPs cross our threshold for genome-wide significance ([formula], see Figure [\ref=fig:regions]). These 19 include two SNPs previously associated with refractive error in GWAS of European populations: rs524952 near GJD2 and ACTC1 and rs4778882 near RASGRF1 [\cite=pmid20835236] [\cite=pmid22665138] [\cite=pmid20835239]. p-values genome-wide are shown in Figure [\ref=fig:manhattan]; Figure [\ref=fig:qqplot] shows the quantile-quantile plot for the analysis.

Of the 19 SNPs significant in the discovery set, nine were also significant in the replication set (Table [\ref=tab:tab2]). As the replication set was small (barely a tenth the size of the discovery set) and measured age of onset less exactly, it is not surprising that not all SNPs replicated. We defined a genetic myopia propensity score as the number of copies of the risk alleles across all 19 SNPs identified via the discovery set. The propensity score showed a strong association with early onset myopia (less than 10 years old) in our replication cohort ([formula], odds ratio 1.08 per risk allele). The top decile of genetic propensity had 2.54 greater odds of developing myopia before the age of 10 than the bottom decile. In a Cox model fit to the discovery set, the propensity score explains 2.7% of the total variance. Note that this estimate may be inflated, as it is calculated on the discovery population. In this model, someone in the 90th percentile of risk (a score of 21.4) is nearly twice as likely to develop myopia by the age of 60 as someone in the 10th percentile of risk (score of 14.3), Figure [\ref=fig:survival].

Of the 17 novel associations, many lie in or near genes with direct links to processes related to myopia development. Below, we briefly sketch out possible connections between these associations and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, the visual cycle, eye and body growth, retinal neuron development, and general neuronal development or signaling.

Extracellular Matrix Remodeling

The strongest association is a SNP in an intron of LAMA2 (laminin, alpha 2 subunit, rs12193446, p = 1.0  ·  10- 42, hazard ratio (HR) 0.80). Laminins are extracellular structural proteins that are integral parts of the ECM. Changes in the composition of the ECM of the sclera have been shown to alter the axial length of the eye [\cite=pmid16202407]. Laminins play a role in the development and maintenance of different eye structures [\cite=pmid16505007] [\cite=pmid7649817]. The laminin alpha 2 chain is found in the extraocular muscles during development [\cite=pmid16505007], and may act as an adhesive substrate and possibly a guidance cue for retinal ganglion cell growth cones [\cite=pmid8613743]. We also found a suggestive association related to laminin (rs1031004, p = 1.5  ·  10- 7, HR=1.06) 312 kb upstream of ANTXR2 (anthrax toxin receptor 2). ANTXR2 binds laminin and possibly collagen type IV [\cite=pmid11683410] and thus may also be involved in extracellular matrix remodeling.

The Visual Cycle

Two of the novel associations are in or near genes involved in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the light sensitive component of photoreceptors; this regeneration is commonly referred to as the visual cycle of the retina. These associations are with rs3138142, [formula], HR=0.89 in RDH5 (retinol dehydrogenase 5 (11-cis/9-cis)) and rs745480 ([formula], HR=1.06), a SNP 18 kb upstream of RGR, which encodes the retinal G protein-coupled receptor. The SNP rs3138142 is a synonymous change in RDH5. It has been linked to RDH5 expression [\cite=pmid18846210] [\cite=pmid17873874], and it is part of an Nr2f2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2) transcription factor binding motif in mouse [\cite=pmid19443739] [\cite=regulomedb]. Both RDH5 and RGR play crucial roles in the regeneration of 11-cis retinal in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [\cite=pmid15987797]. Mutations in RDH5 have been linked with fundus albipunctatus, a rare form of congenital stationary night blindness (for a recent review, see [\cite=pmid22669287]) and progressive cone dystrophy [\cite=pmid11053295], and mutations in RGR have been linked with autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa [\cite=pmid11559856] [\cite=pmid12843338].

We also identified an association within another gene that functions in the RPE: rs7744813 (p = 1.7  ·  10- 17, HR=0.92), a SNP in KCNQ5 (potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 5). KCNQ5 encodes a potassium channel found in the RPE and neural retina. These channels are believed to contribute to ion flow across the RPE [\cite=pmid22135213] [\cite=pmid21795522] and to affect the function of cone and rod photoreceptors [\cite=pmid21795522].

Eye and Body Growth

Three of our associations show possible links to eye or overall morphology. The first is a missense mutation in PRSS56 (A224T, rs1550094, p = 4.9  ·  10- 13, HR=1.08). Other mutations in PRSS56 have been shown to cause strikingly small eyes with severe decreases in axial length [\cite=pmid21532570] [\cite=pmid21850159] [\cite=pmid21397065]. Two other associated SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with height: rs10113215 (p = 2.6  ·  10- 18, HR=0.92), near TOX and CA8 (thymus high mobility group box protein; carbonic anhydrase VIII), and rs7624084 (p = 3.8  ·  10- 10, HR=0.94), near ZBTB38 (zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 38). The SNPs rs10113215 and rs7624084 are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs6569648 and rs6763931, respectively (r2  >  0.6 and r2  >  0.8); both of which have been associated with height [\cite=pmid20881960] [\cite=pmid18391951].

Retinal Ganglion Cell Projections

Two of the novel associations are near genes that affect the outgrowth of retinal ganglion neurons during development. The first is rs4291789 ([formula], HR=1.07), which lies 34 kb downstream of ZIC2 (Zic family member 2). ZIC2 regulates two independent parts of ipsilateral retinal ganglion cell development: axon repulsion at the optic chiasm midline [\cite=pmid18417618] [\cite=pmid13678579], and organization of the axonal projections at their final targets in the brain [\cite=pmid20676059].

The second, rs2137277 ([formula], HR=0.91), is a variant in ZMAT4 (zinc finger, matrin-type 4). ZMAT4 has no known link to vision, but this variant also lies 385 kb downstream of SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1). SFRP1 is involved in the differentiation of the optic cup from the neural retina [\cite=pmid21896628], retinal neurogenesis [\cite=pmid21478884], the development and function of photoreceptor cells [\cite=pmid15235574] [\cite=pmid12724355], and the growth of retinal ganglion cells [\cite=pmid16172602].

Neuronal Signaling and Development

Finally, we found five associations with SNPs in genes involved in neuronal development and signaling, but without a known role in vision development or the vision cycle: in KCNMA1 (potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily M, alpha member 1; rs6480859, [formula], HR=1.06); in RBFOX1 (RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog; rs17648524, [formula], HR=1.10); in LRRC4C, leucine rich repeating region containing 4C, also known as NGL-1 (rs11602008, [formula], HR=1.15); in DLG2 (discs, large homolog 2; rs10736767, [formula], HR=1.06); and in TJP2 (tight junction protein 2; rs11145746, [formula], HR=1.08).

KCNMA1 encodes the pore-forming alpha subunit of a MaxiK channel, a family of large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive potassium channels involved in the control of smooth muscle and neuronal excitation. RBFOX1 belongs to a family of RNA binding proteins that regulates the alternative splicing of several neuronal transcripts implicated in neuronal development and maturation [\cite=pmid22730494]. LRRC4C encodes a binding partner for netrin G1 and promotes the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons [\cite=pmid14595443]. DLG2 plays a critical role in the formation and regulation of protein scaffolding at postsynaptic sites [\cite=pmid21739617]. TJP2 has been linked with hearing loss: its duplication and subsequent overexpression are found in adult-onset progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss [\cite=pmid20602916].

Conclusion

This study represents the largest GWAS on myopia in Europeans to date. This cohort of 43,360 individuals led to the discovery of 17 novel associations as well as replication of the two previously reported associations in Europeans. In contrast to the earlier studies that used refractive error as a quantitative outcome, we used a Cox proportional hazards model with age of onset of myopia as our major endpoint. This model yielded greater statistical power than a simple case-control study of myopia. Of the 19 significant SNPs found using this model, all but one had smaller p-values when a hazards model was employed, and only 13 would be genome-wide significant using a case-control analysis on the same dataset (Table [\ref=tab:sup1]).

The proportional hazards model assumes that each SNP has a constant effect on the hazard of developing myopia at any age. When we tested the validity of this assumption for the 19 significant SNPs, five showed evidence of different effects at different ages (Table [\ref=tab:sup_prop]). While this violation should not lead to overly small p-values for these SNPs in the GWAS, it does make risk prediction based on these results less straightforward. These age dependent hazards suggest that different biological processes may affect the development of myopia at different ages. For example, rs12193446 in LAMA2 shows a large effect on myopia hazard at an early age, peaking around 11 years, and then a null or even negative effect on hazard after the age of 30; other SNPs show different patterns of effect as a function of age (Figure [\ref=fig:proportional]).

Our findings further suggest that there may be somewhat different genetic factors underlying myopia age of onset and refractive error. Because adult onset myopia tends to be less severe than myopia developed in childhood or adolescence [\cite=pmid8751115] [\cite=pmid19353396] [\cite=pmid14977519], age of onset is likely correlated with refractive error, but it is not known how strongly. Many of our associations showed a stronger signal than the two associations near GJD2 and near RASGRF1 previously linked with refractive error in Europeans. Notably, the latter association, near RASGRF1, also failed to replicate in a recent meta-analysis [\cite=pmid22665138]. The fact that many of our associations with strong effects on age of onset have not shown up in previous refractive error GWAS implies that some genetic factors may affect the age of onset independent of eventual severity, and that the strength of different genetic associations with myopia may depend on the specific phenotype under study.

We also note that our phenotype was based on participants' reports rather than clinical assessments. Although in theory errors in recall could have affected our results, we expect that the vast majority of people are able to recall when they first wore glasses with at most a few years of error.

The five associations previously reported in pathological myopia or refractive error GWAS in Asian populations [\cite=pmid21095009] [\cite=pmid19779542] [\cite=pmid21505071] [\cite=pmid21640322] [\cite=pmid22685421] show no overlap with the significant or suggestive regions found here. Nor did we find an association with the ZNF644 locus that was identified as the site of high-penetrance, autosomal dominant mutations in Han Chinese families with apparent monogenic inheritance of high-grade myopia [\cite=pmid21695231]. This lack of overlap is further evidence that the genetic factors involved in myopia differ across populations.

Our identification of 17 novel genetic associations suggests several novel genetic pathways in the development of human myopia. These findings augment existing research on the development of myopia, which to date has been studied primarily in animal models of artificially induced myopia. Some of the associations are consistent with the current view, based largely on animal models, that a visually-triggered signaling cascade from the retina ultimately guides the scleral remodeling that leads to eye growth, and that the RPE plays a key role in this process [\cite=pmid16079001]. A number of the novel associations point to the potential importance of early neuronal development in the eventual development of myopia, particularly the growth and topographical organization of retinal ganglion cells. These associations suggest that early neuronal development may also contribute to future refractive errors. We expect that these findings will drive new research into the complex etiology of myopia.

Methods

Human Subjects

All participants were drawn from the customer base of 23andMe, Inc., a consumer genetics company. This cohort has been described in detail previously [\cite=pmid20585627] [\cite=pmid21858135]. Participants provided informed consent and participated in the research online, under a protocol approved by the external AAHRPP-accredited IRB, Ethical & Independent Review Services (E&I Review).

Phenotype data

Participants in the discovery cohort were asked online as part of a medical history questionnaire: "Have you ever been diagnosed by a doctor with any of the following vision conditions?: Nearsightedness (near objects are clear, far objects are blurry) (Yes/No/I don't know)". If they answered "yes", they were asked, "At what age were you first diagnosed with nearsightedness (near objects are clear, far objects are blurry)? Your best guess is fine." Those reporting an age of onset outside of the range 0-100 were removed from analysis. All participants also reported current age.

The replication cohort consisted of 23andMe customers who were not part of the discovery cohort (i.e., they didn't provide a nearsightedness diagnosis). They answered a single question "Did you wear glasses or other corrective eyewear for nearsightedness before the age of 10? (Yes/No/I'm not sure)".

Genotyping and imputation

Participants were genotyped and additional SNP genotypes were imputed against the August 2010 release of the 1000 genomes data as described previously [\cite=pmid22747683]. Briefly, they were genotyped on at least one of three genotyping platforms, two based on the Illumina HumanHap550+ BeadChip, the third based on the Illumina Human OmniExpress+ BeadChip. The platforms included assays for 586,916, 584,942, and 1,008,948 SNPs respectively. Genotypes for a total of 11,914,767 SNPs were imputed in batches of roughly 10,000 individuals, grouped by genotyping platform. Of these, 7,087,609 met our criteria of 0.005 minor allele frequency, average r2 across batches of at least 0.5, and minimum r2 across batches of at least 0.3. (The minimum r2 requirement was added to filter out SNPs that imputed poorly in the batches consisting of the less dense platform.)

Statistical analysis

In order to minimize population substructure while maximizing statistical power, the study was limited to individuals with European ancestry. Ancestry was inferred from the genome-wide genotype data, and principal component analysis was performed as in [\cite=pmid22493691] [\cite=pmid20585627]. No two participants shared more than 700 cM of DNA identical by descent (IBD, approximately the lower end of sharing between a pair of first cousins). IBD was calculated using the methods described in [\cite=pmid22509285].

For the survival analysis, let the hazard function h(t) be the rate of developing myopia at time t. Then the Cox proportional hazards model is

[formula]

for an arbitrary baseline hazard function α(t) and covariates G (genotype), S (sex) and [formula] (projections onto principal components). G was coded as a dosage from 0-2 as the estimated number of minor alleles present.

For each SNP, we fit a Cox proportional hazards model using R [\cite=Rsurv] and computed a p-value using a likelihood ratio test for the genotype term. All SNPs with p-values under 5  ·  10- 8 after genomic control correction were considered genome-wide significant. The hazard ratio (HR) reported throughout can be interpreted as the multiplicative change in the rate of onset of myopia per copy of the minor allele (e.g., eβg). To test the proportional hazards assumption, we tested for independence of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for each significant SNP and time using cox.zph (Table [\ref=tab:sup_prop]). Replication p-values in Table [\ref=tab:tab2] are one-sided p-values for a logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, and five principal components.

For Figure [\ref=fig:survival], we computed a myopia propensity score for each individual as the (estimated) number of risk alleles among the 19 genome-wide significant SNPs. We then fit a Cox model including that score, sex, and five principal components. To estimate proportion variance explained for this model, we used a pseudo-r2 using likelihoods (similar to the Nagelkerke pseudo r2 for logistic regression). That is, we calculated the variance explained as

[formula]

where L0 is the null likelihood and L the likelihood for the full model. This is one of several methods used to compute variance explained for Cox proportional hazards models [\cite=pmid8896135].
