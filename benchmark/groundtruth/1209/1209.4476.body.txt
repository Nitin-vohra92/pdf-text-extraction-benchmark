Can Virtual Cosmic Strings Shift the Hawking Temperature?

Recently, Coleman, Preskill and Wilczek have discussed [\cite=1] the role of virtual cosmic strings around black holes with screened charge in the Higgs phase. The electric field induced by the charge of the black hole (quantum electric hair) is present in the locus of the virtual (thin) strings near the horizon membrane. Thus, we can measure the effect of the screened charge of the black hole in the vicinity of the horizon surface.

The authors of ref. [\cite=1] have also shown that the charge of the system reduces the temperature of the black hole by the discussion on the partition function. It is worth studying the possibility that we can observe the quantum effects of the screened charge of black holes at a spatially-distant place.

In the present letter, we explicitly evaluate the expression for the Hawking radiation of chaeged particles in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum [\cite=2] at spatial infinity, taking the virtual string effect into account. The "effective" temperature will be read from the amount of the Hawking radiation.

Now suppose we live in the Higgs (screened) phase of Abelian Higgs model in which the Higgs has U(1) charge Ne (N > 1). We consider the "thin string" case, for a definite discussion. (In D dimensions, a topological defect in the model has (D - 3) dimensional extension.) The "motion" of the virtual string as a topological defect generates the following gauge configuration at spatial infinity [\cite=1]:

[formula]

where β- 1 = (D - 3)πrg) is the Hawking temperature (kB = 1); rg is the Schwarzschild radius. The integer k is the wrapping number of the string loop around the hole. Therefore, the (quantum-mechanical) physical quantity at a distance from the black hole can seemingly be affected by the "topological" gauge configuration induced by the quantum fluctuation of cosmic strings near the black hole.

As a probe, we consider a conformally coupled scalar field with unit U(1) charge e.

The free energy density of the Hawking radiation of the scalar particles in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum at spatial infinity is written as follows in the presence of the external field ([\ref=1]) [\cite=3]:

[formula]

The partition function labeled by the wrapping number k is given by

[formula]

where Zstring is the partition function of the cosmic string and is approximately given by

[formula]

in the thin string limit, or the string tension κ is very large, Zrad. is given by

[formula]

where V = LD - 1 is the volume of the system. In the present case, since we must treat the quantity at a far distance from the black hole, we must take L  ≫  rg. If L  ~  rg, we must seriously consider the effect of string dynamics as well as the curved space effect. We should also note that the inclusion of the partition function of the black hole is unnecessary in ([\ref=3]), because that is independent of k in the Schwarzschild case and can be treated as a direct product on the final result.

The partition function of the system with charge Q is obtained by the projection

[formula]

Using ([\ref=2]), ([\ref=4]), and ([\ref=5]), we can get ZQ. If V / (βD - 1  ≫  1, we can consistently approximate ZQ as

[formula]

where X is

[formula]

For D = 4, X = (π2 / 6){(N - 1)2 / N4}. Note also that X = 0 if N = 1.

For the massless particles, we get the expression for the energy density:

[formula]

The amount of the energy density is modified by the virtual string effect. The difference is, however, very small. (In ref. [\cite=3], we have unfortunately missed the last exponential factor in ([\ref=9]).)

Since the temperature of the black hole (at the zero-loop level) β- 1 is of the order of rg, V / (βD - 1  ≫  1 must hold. Therefore, the last factor in ([\ref=9]) gives rise to the very severe suppression.

To summarise, we have found that the Hawking radiation of charged particles suffers from very tiny correction from the cloud of virtual cosmic strings and thus we can hardly "detect" the modification in the distance far from the black hole. A naive expectation of the effect of the "topological" configuration ([\ref=1]) failed us. Since the problem of "detection" in the curved space is subtle, we could not give a definitive statement actually. We can safely conclude, at least, that the black hole temperature does not shift by the virtual string effect, according to the usual interpretation of the Hartle-Hawking vacuum ((unstable) equilibrium between black holes and radiation).

Of course, we may observe the quantum process in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. The evaporation of the black hole may be affected by the cloud of the virtual string loops. To study the effect, we must investigate the string dynamics in the curved space-time more closely. It is a fascinating problem in future.
