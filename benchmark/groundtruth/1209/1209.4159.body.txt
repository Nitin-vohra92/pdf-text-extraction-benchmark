The Ramsey number of loose paths in 3-uniform hypergraphs

This research was in part supported by a grant from IPM (No.90050049)

A hypergraph H is a pair H = (V,E), where V is a finite nonempty set (the set of vertices) and E is a collection of distinct nonempty subsets of V (the set of edges). A k-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph such that all its edges have size k. For two k-uniform hypergraphs H and G, the Ramsey number R(H,G) is the smallest number N such that, in any red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete k-uniform hypergraph KkN on N vertices there is either a red copy of H or a blue copy of G. There are several natural definitions for a cycle and a path in a uniform hypergraph. Here we consider the one called loose. A k-uniform loose cycle Ckn (shortly, a cycle of length n), is a hypergraph with vertex set [formula] and with the set of n edges [formula], [formula], where we use mod n(k - 1) arithmetic and adding a number t to a set [formula] means a shift, i.e. the set obtained by adding t to subscripts of each element of H. Similarly, a k-uniform loose path Pkn (simply, a path of length n), is a hypergraph with vertex set [formula] and with the set of n edges [formula], [formula] and we denote this path by [formula]. For k = 2 we get the usual definitions of a cycle and a path. In this case, a classical result in graph theory (see [\cite=Ramsey_number_of_paths]) states that [formula] where n  ≥  m  ≥  1. Moreover, the exact values of R(Pn,Cm) and R(Cn,Cm) for positive integers n and m are determined[\cite=survey]. For k = 3 it was proved in [\cite=Ramsy_number_of_loose_cycle] that R(C3n,C3n), and consequently R(P3n,P3n) and R(P3n,C3n), are asymptotically equal to [formula]. Subsequently, Gyárfás et. al. in [\cite=Ramsy_number_of_loose_cycle_for_k-uniform] extended this result to the k-uniform loose cycles and proved that R(Ckn,Ckn), and consequently R(Pkn,Pkn) and R(Pkn,Ckn), are asymptotically equal to [formula]. For small cases, Gyárfás et. al. (see [\cite=subm]) proved that R(Pk3,Pk3) = R(Pk3,Ck3) = R(Ck3,Ck3) + 1 = 3k - 1 and R(Pk4,Pk4) = R(Pk4,Ck4) = R(Ck4,Ck4) + 1 = 4k - 2. To see a survey on Ramsey numbers involving cycles see [\cite=Rad].

It is easy to see that [formula] is a lower bound for the Ramsey number R(Pkn,Pkm). To show this, partition the vertex set of KkN - 1 into parts A and B, where |A| = (k - 1)n and [formula], color all edges that contain a vertex of B blue, and the rest red. Now, this coloring can not contain a red copy of Pkn, since such a copy has (k - 1)n + 1 vertices. Clearly the longest blue path has length at most m - 1, which proves our claim. Using the same argument we can see that N and N - 1 are the lower bounds for R(Pkn,Ckm) and R(Ckn,Ckm), respectively. In [\cite=subm], motivated by the above facts and some other results, the authors conjectured that these lower bounds give the exact values of the mentioned Ramsey numbers for k = 3. In this paper, we consider this problem and we prove that [formula] for every [formula]. Throughout the paper, for a 2-edge coloring of a uniform hypergraph H, say red and blue, we denote by Fred and Fblue the induced hypergraph on edges of colors red and blue, respectively.

Preliminaries

In this section, we present some lemmas which are essential in the proof of the main results.

Let n  ≥  m  ≥  3 and [formula] be 2-edge colored red and blue. If Ckn  ⊆  Fred, then either Pkn  ⊆  Fred or Pkm  ⊆  Fblue.

Proof. Let [formula] (mod n(k - 1)), [formula], be the edges of Ckn  ⊆  Fred and [formula] be the set of the remaining vertices. Set [formula] and for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1 let

[formula]

If one of [formula] is red, we have a monochromatic Pkn  ⊆  Fred, otherwise [formula] form a blue Pkm, which completes the proof.

[formula]

Let P be a loose path and x,y be vertices which are not in P. By a ϖ{vi,vj,vk}-configuration, we mean a copy of P32 with edges {x,vi,vj} and {vj,vk,y} so that vl's, l∈{i,j,k}, belong to two consecutive edges of P. The vertices x and y are called the end vertices of this configuration. Using this notation, we have the following lemmas.

Let n  ≥  10, K3n be 2-edge colored red and blue and P, say in Fred, be a maximum path. Let A be the set of five consecutive vertices of P. If W = {x1,x2,x3} is disjoint from P, then we have a ϖS-configuration in Fblue with two end vertices in W and S  ⊆  A.

Proof. First let [formula] for two edges e = {v1,v2,v3} and e' = {v3,v4,v5}. Since P  ⊆  Fred is maximal, at least one of the edges e1  =  {x1,v1,v2} and e2  =  {v2,v3,x2} must be blue. If both are blue, then e1e2 is such a configuration. So first let e1 be blue and e2 be red. Maximality of P implies that at least one of the edges e3  =  {x2,v1,v4} or e4  =  {x3,v2,v5} is blue (otherwise, replacing ee' by e3e2e4 in P yields a red path greater than P, a contradiction), and clearly in each case we have a ϖS-configuration. Now, let e1 be red and e2 be blue. Clearly e5  =  {v2,v4,x3} is blue and e2e5 form a ϖS-configuration. Now let [formula] where e1  =  {x,v1,v2}, e2  =  {v2,v3,v4} and e3  =  {v4,v5,y} are three consecutive edges of P. If {xi,v2,v3} is a red edge for some i∈{1,2,3}, then {v3,v4,xj} and {v3,v5,xj} are blue for j  ≠  i and so we are done. By the same argument the theorem is true if {xi,v3,v4} is red. Now we may assume {v2,v3,xi} and {v3,v4,xi} are blue for each i∈{1,2,3} and so there is nothing to prove.

[formula]

Assume that [formula] and [formula] is 2-edge colored red and blue. If P  ⊆  Fblue is a maximum path and W is the set of the vertices which are not covered by P, then for every 4 consecutive edges e1,e2,e3,e4 of P either there is a P35  ⊆  Fred, say Q, between {e1,e2,e3,e4} and W with end vertices in W and with no the last vertex of e4 as a vertex such that [formula] or there is a P34  ⊆  Fred, say Q, between {e1,e2,e3} and W with end vertices in W and with no the last vertex of e3 as a vertex such that [formula]. In each of the above cases, each vertex of W except one vertex can be considered as the end vertex of Q.

Proof. Suppose that e1,e2,e3,e4 be four consecutive edges in P. Let ei  =  {v2i - 1,v2i,v2i + 1}, 1  ≤  i  ≤  4, and W = {x1,...,xt} and [formula].

Case 1. For every 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  t, {v1,v2,xi} and {v2,v3,xj} are red.

Subcase 1. For every 1  ≤  k,l  ≤  t, the edges {v3,v4,xk} and {v4,v5,xl} are red.

So for each {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T), the edges, {xi1,v1,v2},{v2,xi2,v3},{v3,xi3,v4},{v4,v5,xi4} make a red P34 with end vertices xi1 and xi4.

Subcase 2. There exists 1  ≤  k  ≤  t, such that the edge {v3,v4,xk} is blue.

So for each {i1,i2,i3,}∈P3(T) with k  ≠  i2,i3, {xi1,v1,v2},{v2,v3,xi2},{xi2,v5,v4},{v4,v6,xi3} are the edges of a red desired P34 with end vertices xi1 and xi3.

Subcase 3. There exists 1  ≤  k  ≤  t, such that the edge {v4,v5,xk} is blue.

If for every 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  t, the edges {v5,v6,xi} and {v6,v7,xj} are red, then for every {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T) with i3  ≠  k, we can find a red copy of P35 with edges {xi1,v1,v2},{v2,xi2,v3},{v3,v4,xi3},{xi3,v5,v6},{v6,v7,xi4} and end vertices xi1 and xi4. Otherwise there exists 1  ≤  l  ≤  t, such that either {v5,v6,xl} or {v6,v7,xl} is blue. For the first one, for every {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T) with i3  ≠  k,l and i4  ≠  l, {xi1,v1,v2},{v2,xi2,v3},{v3,v4,xi3},{xi3,v7,v6},{v6,v8,xi4} make a red copy of P35 with end vertices xi1 and xi4 and for the second one, for every {i1,i2,i3,}∈P3(T) with l  ≠  i2,i3 the edges, {xi1,v1,v2,},{v2,v3,xi2},{xi2,v6,v5},{v5,xi3,xl} make a red P34 with end vertices xi1 and y where y∈{xi3,xl}.

Case 2. For some 1  ≤  i  ≤  t, {v1,v2,xi} is blue.

Subcase 1. For every 1  ≤  k,l  ≤  t, the edges {v5,v6,xk} and {v6,v7,xl} are red.

For each {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  4, the edges, {xi1,xi,v3},{v3,xi2,v2},{v2,v4,xi3},{xi3,v5,v6},{v6,v7,xi4} make a red P35 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi4.

Subcase 2. For some 1  ≤  k  ≤  t, {v5,v6,xk} is blue.

In this case, for each {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  4, and i3,i4  ≠  k, the edges {xi1,xi,v3},{v3,xi2,v2},{v2,v4,xi3},{xi3,v7,v6}, {v6,v8,xi4} make a red P35 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi4.

Subcase 3. For some 1  ≤  k  ≤  t, {v6,v7,xk} is blue.

In this case, for each {i1,i2,i3}∈P3(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  3, and i2,i3  ≠  k, the edges {xi1,xi,v3},{v3,v2,xi2},{xi2,v4,v6},{v6,v5,xi3} make a red P34 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi3.

Case 3. For some 1  ≤  i  ≤  t, {v2,v3,xi} is blue.

Subcase 1. For every 1  ≤  k,l  ≤  t, the edges {v3,v4,xk} and {v4,v5,xl} are red.

For each {i1,i2,i3}∈P3(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  3, {xi1,xi,v1},{v1,v2,xi2},{xi2,v3,v4},{v4,v5,xi3} are the edges of a red P34 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi3.

Subcase 2. For some 1  ≤  k  ≤  t, {v3,v4,xk} is blue.

In this case, for each {i1,i2,i3}∈P3(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  3, and i2,i3  ≠  k, the edges, {xi1,xi,v1},{v1,v2,xi2},{xi2,v5,v4},{v4,v6,xi3} make a red copy of P34 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi3.

Subcase 3. For some 1  ≤  k  ≤  t, {v4,v5,xk} is blue.

If for every 1  ≤  l,h  ≤  t, the edges {v5,v6,xl} and {v6,v7,xh} are red, then for each {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  4, and i3  ≠  k, the edges, {xi1,xi,v1},{v1,xi2,v2},{v2,v4,xi3},{xi3,v5,v6},{v6,v7,xi4} make a red P35 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi4. Otherwise there exists 1  ≤  l  ≤  t, such that either {v5,v6,xl} or {v6,v7,xl} is blue. For the first one, for each {i1,i2,i3,i4}∈P4(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  4, i3  ≠  k,l and i4  ≠  l, the edges {xi1,xi,v1},{v1,xi2,v2},{v2,v4,xi3}, {xi3,v7,v6},{v6,v8,xi4} make a red copy of P35 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi} and xi4. For the second one, for every {i1,i2,i3}∈P3(T) with ij  ≠  i, 1  ≤  j  ≤  3, and i2,i3  ≠  l, {{xi1,xi,v1},{v1,v2,xi2},{xi2,v4,x6},{v6,v5,xi3}} is the set of the edges of a red P34 with end vertices y, y∈{xi1,xi}, and xi3. These observations complete the proof. [formula]

Main Results

In this section, we prove that [formula] for every [formula]. First we present several lemmas which will be our main tools in establishing the main theorem.

Assume that [formula] and [formula] is 2-edge colored red and blue. If P  =  P3m - 1 is a maximum blue path, then P3n - 1  ⊆  Fred.

Proof. Let [formula] and [formula] be a copy of P3m - 1  ⊆  Fblue with edges ei  =  {v1,v2,v3} + 2(i - 1), [formula]. Set [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=P5_or_P4] there is a red path Q1 with end vertices x1 and y1 in W1 = W between E'1 and W1 where E1  =  {ei:i1 = 1  ≤  i  ≤  4}, [formula] and E'1∈{E1,Ē1}. Set [formula], E2  =  {ei:i2  ≤  i  ≤  i2 + 3} and [formula] and [formula]. Again using Lemma [\ref=P5_or_P4] there is a red path Q2 between E'2 and W2 such that [formula] is a red path with end vertices x2,y2 in W2 where E'2∈{E2,Ē2} and again set [formula], E3  =  {ei:i3  ≤  i  ≤  i3 + 3}, [formula] and [formula]. Since |W|  ≥  m, using Lemma [\ref=P5_or_P4] by continuing the above process we can partition [formula] into classes E'ith, |E'i|∈{3,4} and at most one class of size r  ≤  3 of the last edges such that for each i, there is a red Qi  =  P35 (resp. Qi  =  P34) between E'i and W with the properties in Lemma [\ref=P5_or_P4] if |E'i| = 4 (resp. |E'i| = 3) and [formula] is a red path with end vertices x,y in W. Let l1 = |{i:|E'i| = 4}| and l2 = |{i:|E'i| = 3}|. So m - 2 = 4l1 + 3l2 + r, 0  ≤  r  ≤  3 and [formula] has 5l1 + 4l2 edges. One can easily check that [formula]. Also we have

[formula]

Let [formula] and suppose that m = 4k + p for some p, 0  ≤  p  ≤  4. Therefore |T|  ≥  r + 2 if p = 0,1 and |T|  ≥  r + 1 if p = 2,3. Now we consider the following cases.

Case 1. r = 0.

Clearly |T|  ≥  1 and it is easy to see that [formula] contains at least n - 2 edges. Let {u}  ⊆  T. The maximality of P implies that the edge e = {v2m - 1,x,u} is red and hence [formula] is a red copy of P3n - 1.

Case 2. r = 1.

In this case, |T|  ≥  2 and it is easy to see that [formula] contains at least n - 3 edges. Let {u,v}  ⊆  T. Clearly [formula] is a red copy of P3n - 1.

Case 3. r = 2.

It is easy to see that |T|  ≥  3 and [formula] contains at least n - 5 edges. Let T' = {u,v,w}  ⊆  T. Since [formula] by lemma [\ref=spacial_configuration] there is a red ϖS-configuration with [formula] and its end vertices in T', say u and v. The maximality of P implies that the edges {v2m - 2,x,u} and {v2m - 1,v,w} are red and clearly we have a red P3n - 1.

Case 4. r = 3.

In this case, for p∈{2,3} we have |T|  ≥  4 and [formula] contains at least n - 5 edges. Using an argument similar to case 3 we can complete the proof. Now let p∈{0,1}. Then |T|  ≥  5 and [formula] contains at least n - 6 edges. Set T' = {u,v,w,z,t}  ⊆  T. By Lemma [\ref=spacial_configuration], there is a ϖS-configuration C with [formula] and end vertices in T', say u and v. Clearly [formula] is a red P3n - 1. These observations complete the proof. [formula]

Let [formula] and [formula] be 2-edge colored red and blue. If P3n - 1  ⊆  Fred be a maximum path, then P3m  ⊆  Fblue.

Proof. Let [formula] and [formula] be a copy of P3n - 1  ⊆  Fred with end edges e1  =  {v1,v2,v3} and en - 1  =  {v2n - 3,v2n - 2,v2n - 1}. By Lemma [\ref=No_Cn], we may assume that the subhypergraph induced by V(P) does not have a red copy of C3n. Let [formula] and let 2n - 2 = 5q + h where 0  ≤  h < 5. Partition the set [formula] into q classes [formula] of size five and one class [formula] of size h if h > 0, so that each class contains consecutive vertices of P. Using Lemma [\ref=spacial_configuration], there is a blue ϖS1-configuration, 1, with the set of end vertices E1  ⊆  W and S1  ⊆  A1. Let x1∈E1 and B1 be a 2-subset of [formula]. Again by Lemma [\ref=spacial_configuration], there is a blue ϖS2-configuration, 2, with the set of end vertices [formula] and S2  ⊆  A2. If [formula], then let 3 be a blue ϖS3-configuration with the set of end vertices E3  ⊆  {x1,y,z} and S3  ⊆  A3 where y∈B1 and [formula]. If x1∈E2, then let 3 be a blue ϖS3-configuration with the set of end vertices E3  ⊆  {x2,y,z} and S3  ⊆  A3 where [formula] and [formula]. We continue this process to find the set of [formula] of configurations. When this process terminate, we have the paths Pl'' and Pl' where l''  ≥  l'  ≥  0 and l'' + l' = 2q'. Let x'',y'' (resp. x',y' if l' > 0) be the end vertices of Pl'' (resp. Pl') in W. Let [formula]. Clearly [formula] where i = 1 if l' = 0 and i = 2 if l' > 0. Assume m = 4k + r for some r, 0  ≤  r  ≤  3. We have the following cases.

Case 1. r = 0.

Since q  ≥  2k - 1, we have 2q'  ≥  m - 2. On the other hand, [formula] and so 2q'  ≤  m. If 2q' = m, then l' = 0 and so Pl'' = m is a blue path. Now we may assume that 2q' = m - 2, and one can easily check that the vertices {v2n - 3,v2n - 2,v2n - 1} are not used in [formula]. First let l' = 0. Then |T| = 1 and we may assume T = {u}. Now using the maximality of P and the fact that [formula], [formula] is a blue P3m. For l' > 0, [formula] is a blue P3m.

Case 2. r = 1.

Since [formula], 2q'  ≤  m + 1 and if the equality holds, then l' = 0. On the other hand, q  ≥  2k and so 2q'  ≥  m - 1. Hence 2q'∈{m + 1,m - 1}. If 2q' = m + 1, then l' = 0 and there is a blue P3m + 1. Now let 2q' = m - 1. If l' = 0, then |T| = 1, so T = {u} and hence [formula] is a blue P3m. If l' > 0, then [formula] is a blue P3m.

Case 3. r = 2.

Using an argument similar to the case 1, we have 2q'∈{m,m - 2} and if 2q' = m, then l' = 0 and we have a blue Pl'' = m. Again by an argument similar to the case 1 we have a blue P3m.

Case 4. r = 3.

In this case, partition [formula] into [formula] classes of size five and possibly one class of size at most four. Then we repeat the mentioned process in the first of the proof to find blue paths Pl'' and Pl' with l''  ≥  l'  ≥  0 and l'' + l' = 2q'. Again using a similar argument in case 1, we have 2q'∈{m + 1,m - 1,m - 3}. If 2q' = m + 1, then we have l' = 0 and so there is a blue P3m + 1. For 2q' = m - 1, the assertion holds by an argument similar to the case 2. Now let 2q' = m - 3. If l' = 0, then |T| = 2, so T = {u,v} and hence [formula] is a blue P3m( note that [formula]). If l' > 0, then |T| = 1, so T = {u} and hence [formula] is a blue P3m and the proof is completed. [formula]

For every [formula],

[formula]

Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on m + n. The proof of the case m = n = 1 is trivial. Suppose that for [formula] with [formula], [formula] Now, let [formula] and let [formula] be 2-edge colored red and blue. We may assume there is no red copy of P3n and no blue copy of P3m. Consider the following cases.

Case 1. [formula].

Since [formula] by induction hypothesis, then either there is a P3n - 1  ⊆  Fred or a P3m - 1  ⊆  Fblue. If we have a red copy of P3n - 1, then by Lemma [\ref=a] we have a P3m  ⊆  Fblue. Now assume that there is a blue copy of P3m - 1. Lemma [\ref=pm-1_implies_pn-1] implies that P3n - 1  ⊆  Fred and using Lemma [\ref=a] we have P3m  ⊆  Fblue, a contradiction.

Case 2. [formula].

In this case, [formula] and since [formula], by induction hypothesis we have a P3n - 1  ⊆  Fred. Using Lemma [\ref=a] we have a P3m  ⊆  Fblue and it completes the proof. [formula]
