A note on 5-cycle double covers

Keywords: cycle double cover

Within the topic of cycle covers, a cycle is usually defined as a graph with even degree in every vertex. Since this is not the current standard graph theoretical definition of a cycle, we avoid the term cycle. We define a circuit to be a 2-connected 2-regular graph. For terminology not defined here we refer to [\cite=Bo]. For a survey on cycle covers, see [\cite=Z1].

A cycle double cover (CDC) of a graph G with vertex degree at most 3 is a set [formula] of 2-regular subgraphs of G such that every edge of G is contained in exactly two elements of [formula].

The cycle double cover conjecture (CDCC) states that every bridgeless cubic graph has a CDC.

If a CDC [formula] of a graph G satisfies || = k, then [formula] is called a k-CDC of G. There are several variations of the CDCC, as the strong-CDCC [\cite=L] and the 5-CDCC [\cite=C] [\cite=P].

Strong-CDCC: For every given circuit C of a bridgeless cubic graph G, there is a CDC [formula] with C∈.

5-CDCC: Every bridgeless cubic graph has a 5-CDC.

For the subsequent proofs we need the following two lemmas which are stated in [\cite=K] [\cite=Z1] for cubic graphs but which hold as well for subdivisions of cubic graphs.

A subdivision of a cubic graph has a 4-CDC if and only if it has a nowhere-zero 4-flow.

Let G be a subdivision of a cubic graph admitting a nowhere zero 4-flow and C' be a 2-regular subgraph of G. Then there is a 4-CDC [formula] of G with C'∈.

Let C0 be a 2-regular subgraph of a cubic graph G. We say C0 is contained in a CDC [formula] of G if and only if C0 is a subgraph of one of the elements of [formula].

Let G be a cubic graph with a 2-regular subgraph C0  ⊆  G. Moreover, let : = {C1,C2,...,Ck} be a set of k 2-regular subgraphs of G with C0  ⊆  C1 such that

1. every edge of G is contained in at most two elements of [formula];

2. the edges of G which are contained in two elements of [formula] form a matching M of G;

3. G - M has a nowhere-zero 4-flow;

then G has a (k + 3)-CDC which contains C0.

Proof: Suppose G has such a set C of 2-regular subgraphs as described above. Set G': = G - M and let C' be the 2-regular subgraph which is constructed from [formula] by taking the symmetric difference of all elements of [formula]. By condition 2 above, C' is a 2-regular subgraph of G'. Since G' has a nowhere zero 4-flow we can apply Lemma [\ref=tait1]. Let : = {C',C1',C2',C3'} be a 4-CDC of G'. Set : = {C1',C'2,C'3,C1,C2,...,Ck}. We claim that [formula] is a CDC of G. If e∈M  ⊆  E(G), then e is covered twice by the elements of [formula]. For e∈E(G)  -  M it follows that e∈Cm', m∈{1,2,3}. Consequently, there are two cases to consider:

Case 1: e∈E(Ci),i∈{1,2,...,k}. Then e is covered precisely by Ci and Cm'.

Case 2: e∉E(Ci),i  =  1,2,...,k. Then e∉C' and is thus covered precisely by Cm' and Cr' with [formula] and r∈{1,2,3}.

Hence [formula] is a (k + 3)-CDC of G which contains C0 since C0  ⊆  C1 by assumption.

Let G be a cubic graph with a 2-regular subgraph C0  ⊆  G. Then G has a 5-CDC which contains C0 if and only if

1. G contains a matching M such that G - M has a nowhere-zero 4-flow, and

2. G contains two 2-regular subgraphs C1, C2 with [formula] and C0  ⊆  C1.

Proof: Suppose M, C1, C2 exist with the properties described in 1. and 2. above, then set : = {C1,C2} and apply Proposition [\ref=th1]. Hence G has a 5-CDC containing C0.

Conversely, suppose G has a 5-CDC : = {C1,C2,...,C5} with C0  ⊆  C1. Suppose without loss of generality that [formula]. Then [formula] is a matching M in G since [formula] is a CDC and thus condition 2 is satisfied. Moreover G - M has a 4-CDC [formula] and thus G - M has a nowhere-zero 4-flow by Lemma [\ref=tait2] which finishes the proof.

Theorem [\ref=th2] is useful for showing that for a given circuit C in a snark G there is a CDC of G which contains C. It follows by this theorem that it is sufficient to find a circuit C' which intersects C in a matching M such that G - M has a nowhere-zero 4-flow. If G is the Petersen Graph, it suffices to show that G - M is bridgeless. Thus, it is straightforward to see that every circuit of the Petersen Graph is contained in a 5-CDC.

A cubic graph G has a 5-CDC if and only if G has a matching M such that G - M has a nowhere-zero 4-flow and G contains two 2-regular subgraphs C1 and C2 with [formula].

The preceding considerations lead us to formulate the following conjecture which we call the strong 5-CDCC. This conjecture is a combination and strengthening of the 5-CDCC and the strong-CDCC.

For every given circuit C of a bridgeless cubic graph G, there is a 5-CDC [formula] which contains C.

Note that the strong 5-CDCC has been verified for all snarks of order less than 36; see [\cite=Z2].
