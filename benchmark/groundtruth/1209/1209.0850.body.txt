C * -algebras associated with complex dynamical systems and backward orbit structure

Introduction

Iteration of a rational function R gives a complex dynamical system on the Riemann sphere [formula] . Since there exists a branched point (i.e. critical point), R is not a local homeomorphism any more. Hence we are not able to introduce an étale groupoid in a usual way to associate a groupoid C*-algebra of Renault [\cite=Re]. For a branched covering π:M  →  M, Deaconu and Muhly [\cite=DM] introduced a C*-algebra C*(M,π) as the C*-algebra of the étale groupoid by substructing the branched points.

In [\cite=KW1], we introduced slightly different C * -algebras by Cuntz-Pimsner construction to include branched points. Since the Riemann sphere [formula] is decomposed to the union of the Julia set JR and Fatou set FR, we associated three C*-algebras OR(), OR(JR) and OR(FR) by considering R as dynamical systems on [formula], JR and FR respectively. We have studied how properties of R as complex dynamical systems are related with the structure of the associated C*-algebras and their K-groups [\cite=KW1], [\cite=IKW], [\cite=K] and [\cite=W]. One of our aims is to analyze the singularity structure of the branched points in terms of operator algebras. For example, in [\cite=IKW], we showed that the extreme KMS states are parameterized by the branched points. Recently K. Thomsen introduces and studies another convolution C*-algebra of the transformation groupoid adding local transfers for a rational function in [\cite=Th1], [\cite=Th2].

In this short note, we study backward orbit structure in terms of operator algebras. In particular, we recover the number of n-th backward orbits counted without multiplicity starting at branched points in terms of associated C*-algebras with gauge actions. If there exists a branched point in the backward orbits, then the number decreases at the branched point, because we do not count the multiplicity. In particular, we can partially imagine how a branched point is move to another branched point under the iteration of R. We use KMS states and a Perron-Frobenius type operator to show it. We should mention that Kumjian and Renault [\cite=KR] study the existence and uniqueness of KMS states associated to general expansive maps which are local homeomorphisms.

On the other hand, V. Nekrashevych [\cite=Ne] studies the Cuntz-Pimsner algebras for self-similar groups like iterated monodromy groups of expanding dynamical systems. Surprisingly, he reconstructed the complex dynamical system on the Julia set of a hyperbolic rational function from the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra and the gauge action on it. Nekrashevych's work does not include the case that the Julia set contains branched points, Thus our results contains a new fact on the case.

Let R be a rational function of the form [formula] with relatively prime polynomials P and Q. The degree of R is denoted by N  =   deg R: =  max { deg P, deg Q}. We regard a rational function R as a N-fold branched covering map R:  →   on the Riemann sphere [formula]. The sequence (Rn)n of iterations of R gives a complex dynamical system on [formula]. The Fatou set FR of R is the maximal open subset of [formula] on which (Rn)n is equicontinuous (or a normal family), and the Julia set JR of R is the complement of the Fatou set in [formula]. The Fatou set FR is a stable part and the Julia set JR is an unstable part.

Recall that a branched point (or critical point) of R is a point z0 at which R is not locally one to one. It is a zero of R' or a pole of R of order two or higher. The image w0 = R(z0) is called a branch value (or critical value) of R. Using appropriate local charts, if [formula] with n  ≥  1 and [formula] on some neighborhood of z0, then the integer n  =  e(z0)  =  eR(z0) is called the branch index of R at z0. Thus e(z0)  ≥  2 if z0 is a branched point, and e(z0)  =  1 if z0 is not. Therefore R is an e(z0):1 map in a punctured neighborhood of z0. By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, there exist 2N  -  2 branched points counted with multiplicity, that is, [formula] . Furthermore for each w∈, we have [formula]. Let BR be the set of branched points of R and CR: = R(BR) be the set of the critical values of R. Then the restriction [formula] is a N:1 regular covering, where N  =   deg R. This means that any point [formula] has an open neighborhood V such that R- 1(V) has N connected components [formula] and the restriction R|Uk:Uk  →  V is a homeomorphism for [formula]. Thus R has N analytic local cross sections Sk  =  (R|Uk)- 1. But if y is in CR, then there exist no such open neighborhood V. This fact causes many difficulties to analyze the associated C*-algebra, since we include the branched points to construct the C*-correspondence. If we will construct the associated groupoid naively, the étaleness ( or r-discreteness) is not satisfied in general. This is the reason why we associated our C*-algebras by Cuntz-Pimsner construction in [\cite=KW1]. One of our aims is to analyze the singularity structure of the branched points in terms of operator algebras.

In our previous paper [\cite=IKW], we study KMS-states for the gauge action based on Laca and Neshveyev [\cite=LN]. The gauge action has a phase transition at β  =   log  deg R. We can recover the degree of R, the number of branched points, the number of exceptional points and the orbits of exceptional points from the structure of the KMS states. But we could not know anything how branched points are related each other under the iteration of R. In this note we study the orbit structure of branched points under iteration. The proof depends on the fact that extreme KMS states are parameterized by the branched points as described in [\cite=IKW].

Construction of the associated C*-algebras

Since a rational function R of degree at least two is not a homeomorphism, we can not use crossed product construction. We replace crossed pruduct construction by Cuntz-Pimsner construction to obtain the associated C*-algebra.

We recall Cuntz-Pimsner algebras [\cite=Pi]. Let A be a C*-algebra and X be a Hilbert right A-module. We denote by L(X) be the algebra of the adjointable bounded operators on X. For ξ, η∈X, the "rank one" operator θξ,η is defined by θξ,η(ζ)  =  ξ(η|ζ) for ζ∈X. The closure of the linear span of rank one operators is denoted by K(X).

A family (ui)i∈I in X is called a basis [\cite=K] and [\cite=KPW1] , (or a normalized tight frame more precisely as in [\cite=FL]) of X if

[formula]

where the sum is taken as unconditional norm convergence, that is, for a directed set [formula],

[formula]

Furthermore (ui)i∈I is called a finite basis if (ui)i∈I is a finite set. If a Hilbert C*-module is countably generated, then there exists a countable basis (that is, finite or a countably infinite basis ) of X and written as {ui}∞i = 1, where some ui may be zero. If A has a unit and X has a finite basis, then X is algebraically finitely generated and projective over A and K(X)  =  L(X).

We say that X is a Hilbert C*-bimodule (or C*-correspondence) over A if X is a Hilbert right A- module with a homomorphism φ:A  →  L(X). In this note, we assume that X is full and φ is injective. Let [formula] be the full Fock module of X with the convention [formula]. For x∈X, the creation operator Tx∈L(F(X)) is defined by

[formula]

We define iF(X):A  →  L(F(X)) by

[formula]

for a,b∈A. The Cuntz-Toeplitz algebra TX is the C*-subalgebra of L(F(X)) generated by iF(X)(a) with a∈A and Tx with x∈X. Let jK:K(X)  →  TX be the homomorphism defined by jK(θx,y)  =  TxT*y. We consider the ideal IX: = φ- 1(K(X)) of A. Let JX be the ideal of TX generated by [formula]. Then the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OX is the the quotient TX  /  JX . Let π:TX  →  OX be the quotient map. Put Sx  =  π(Tx) and i(a)  =  π(iF(X)(a)). Let iK:K(X)  →  OX be the homomorphism defined by iK(θx,y)  =  SxS*y. Then [formula] for a∈IX. We note that the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra OX is the universal C*-algebra generated by i(a) with a∈A and Sx with x∈X satisfying that i(a)Sx  =  Sφ(a)x, Sxi(a)  =  Sxa, S*xSy  =  i((x|y)A) for a∈A, x,y∈X and [formula] for a∈IX. We usually identify i(a) with a in A. If X has a countable basis [formula], then the last condition should be replaced by [formula] under the operator norm convergence for any a∈IX. Since φ(a)∈K(X), we automatically have [formula] under the operator norm convergence, because [formula] is an approximately units for K(X).

There exists an action [formula] with γt(Sξ)  =  eitSξ, which is called the gauge action. Since we assume that φ:A  →  L(X) is isometric, there is an embedding [formula] with [formula] for [formula] with the convention φ0  =  φ:A  →  L(X). We denote by FX the C*-algebra generated by all [formula], n  ≥  0 in the inductive limit algebra [formula]. Let Fn be the C*-subalgebra of FX generated by [formula], [formula], with the convention [formula]. Then [formula]. Consult [\cite=Pi] and [\cite=KPW2] for a general Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. .

Let A = C() and [formula] be the set of continuous functions on [formula] and [formula] respectively, where [formula] is the graph of R. Then X is an A-A bimodule by

[formula]

We define an A-valued inner product ( | )A on X by

[formula]

Thanks to the branch index e(x), the inner product above gives a continuous function and X is a full Hilbert bimodule over A without completion. The left action of A is unital and faithful.

Since the Julia set JR is completely invariant under R, i.e., R(JR)  =  JR  =  R- 1(JR), we can consider the restriction R|JR:JR  →  JR, which will be often denoted by the same letter R. Let [formula] be the graph of the restriction map R|JR and [formula]. In the same way as above, X(JR) is a full Hilbert bimodule over C(JR). Since the Fatou set FR is also completely invariant, [formula] is a full Hilbert bimodule over C0(FR).

Definition(C*-algebra associated with a complex dynamical system) Let R be a rational function with deg  R  ≥  2. The C*-algebra OR() is defined as the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of the Hilbert bimodule [formula] over A  =  C(). When the Julia set JR is not empty (for example deg R  ≥  2), we define the C*-algebra OR(JR) as the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of the Hilbert bimodule [formula] over A  =  C(JR). When the Fatou set FR is not empty, the C*-algebra OR(FR) is defined similarly.

Perron-Frobenius operator

We shall introduce a Perron-Frobenius operator associated with a bimodule on the space of traces. Let A be a unital C*-algebra. We denote by Trace(A) the set of bounded tracial functionals on A, Trace+(A) the set of bounded tracial positive functionals on A and Trace+1(A) the set of tracial states on A. We assume that Trace(A) is not empty. Let X be a countably generated Hilbert A-module and {ui}∞i = 1 a countable basis of X. For a tracial state τ on A, [formula] does not depend on the choice of basis {ui}∞i = 1 as in [\cite=KW2] and [\cite=KW3]. We put [formula]. We call that X is of finite degree type if sup τ∈Trace+1(A)dτ  <    ∞   ([\cite=KPW1], [\cite=KW2] and [\cite=KW3]). For example, let X be the Hilbert bimodule associated with a rational function R. Then XA is of finite degree type and sup τ∈T+1(A)dτ  =  degree R.

Definition.(Perron-Frobenius operator) Let A be a unital C*-algebra and X a countably generated (right) full Hilbert module over A. Let φ:A  →  L(X) be a unital faithful homomorphism so that X is a bimodule over A. Let{ui}∞i = 1 be a basis of X. If X is of finite degree type, then there exists a bounded linear operator FX:Trace(A)  →  Trace(A) such that for τ∈Trace(A),

[formula]

Then FX does not depend on the choice of basis. We call FX a Perron-Frobenius operator associated with a bimodule X of finite degree type. See [\cite=KPW1], [\cite=KW2], [\cite=KW3] and [\cite=IKW] for example.

Example. Let R be a rational function with deg  R  ≥  2. Consider the C*-algebra OR() associated with a complex dynamical system (Rn)n on the Riemann sphere. The C*-algebra OR() is defined as the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of the Hilbert bimodule [formula] over A  =  C(). Then we shall show that the Perron-Frobenius operator FX associated with a bimodule X is described as follows: For a finite Borel measure μ and a∈A  =  C(), we have that

[formula]

where a Borel function ã is defined by [formula] and we identify the finite Borel measure μ on [formula] with the associated finite trace on C() by the same symbol μ. In particular, we have

[formula]

where δy is the Dirac measure on y. It is crucial that the sum on x∈R- 1(y) should be taken without multiplicity in these formulae.

Let {ui}∞i = 1 be a countable basis of X. For f∈X  =  C(graph R), we have [formula] and the identity [formula] converges in norm [formula]. Hence the left side converges also pointwisely. For each fixed y∈ and x∈R- 1(y), we consider the value of [formula] at (x,y)  =  (x,R(x)):

[formula]

We take f∈X such that f(x,y) = 1 and f(x',y) = 0 for x'∈R- 1(x) with [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

For a∈A, we have

[formula]

Therefore we have

[formula]

Let A be a unital C*-algebra and X a full Hilbert bi-module over A with a unital faithful left action. Let OX be the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra for X with a gauge action γ. Let B  =  OγX be the fixed point algebra under α. Let

[formula]

be the 1-spectral subspace. Then we have the following:

Y is a Hilbert bi-module over B under a natural action b  ·  y  ·  c  =  byc with a B-valued inner product (y | w)B  =  y*w for b,c∈B and y,w∈Y. Moreover the linear span of {Sxb | b∈B,x∈X} is dense in Y.

If {ui}∞i = 1 is a basis of X, then {Sui}∞i = 1 is a basis of Y.

Let FY:Trace(B)  →  Trace(B) be the Perron-Frobenius operator associated with Y. Then (FY(τ))(a)  =  (FX(τ|A))(a) for any trace τ∈Trace(B) and its restriction τ|A to A and a∈A.

(1)Since y,w∈Y is in 1-spectral subspace, y*w is in the the fixed point algebra B  =  OαX under α. Since [formula], Y is complete. The others are also easily checked. (2)Let {ui}∞i = 1 be a basis of X. For any x∈X, b∈B, we have

[formula]

since [formula]. (3)For any trace τ∈Trace(B) and for any a∈A,

[formula]

Remark. In the above, The Perron-Frobenius operator FX associated with a bimodule X depends on the choice of the bimodule by definition. Since the bimodule Y is defined by only the C*-algebra OX with the gauge action γ, the Perron-Frobenius operator FY associated with the bimodule Y is an invariant of C*-algebra OX with the gauge action γ up to conjugacy and does not depend on the original bi-module X. Moreover (3) of the above proposition shows that, for a fixed β, the set Ext(KMSβ(OX,γ)) of extreme β - KMS states for the gauge action γ on OX and the set

[formula]

are invariants of C*-algebra OX with the gauge action γ. We do study the number (FY(τ|B))(I) = (FX(τ|A))(I) and more generally a sequence ((FnY(τ|B))(I))n  =  ((FnX(τ|A))(I))n in the next section.

orbit structure of branched points

Since a rational functions is analytic as a map of [formula] to [formula] and have a rigid nature, its behavior on the singularities determines the main property of the rational function. Therefore it is important to study the orbit structure of the branched points of a rational function.

Definition. Let R be a rational function with N = degR  ≥  2. We denote by bn(z)  =   #(R- n(z)) the number of the n-th backward orbit R- n(z) counted without multiplicity starting at z∈. We define the associated sequence b(z): = (bn(z))∞n = 0. If the backward orbit [formula] has no intersection with the set BR of the branched points, then

[formula]

In general the sequence b(z) measures the existence of branched points in the backward orbit [formula] starting at z.

Example. Let R(z)  =  z2. Then BR  =  {0,  ∞  }. Since R- 1(0)  =  {0} and R- 1(  ∞  )  =  {  ∞  }, we have

[formula]

Example. Let R(z)  =  z2 + 1. Then BR  =  {0,  ∞  }. Since there exist no branched point in the backward orbit [formula] starting at 0 and R- 1(  ∞  )  =  {  ∞  },

[formula]

Example. Let R(z)  =  z2 - 1. Then BR  =  {0,  ∞  }. Since R(0)  =   - 1,R( - 1)  =  0 and R- 1(  ∞  )  =  {  ∞  }, we have that

[formula]

[formula]

Example. There exists a constant c with R(z)  =  z2  +  c such that R3(0)  =  0 and [formula], [formula]. Then BR  =  {0,  ∞  }. We have that

[formula]

Example. For any fixed natural number m  ≥  2, there exists a constant cm with R(z)  =  z2  +  cm such that Rm(0)  =  0 and [formula] for [formula], and BR  =  {0,  ∞  }. We have that

[formula]

In fact, consider a sequence (fm)m of real functions defined by

[formula]

Then fm is a polynomial of degree 2m - 1 - 1 and has a real root. Let

[formula]

Then fm(cm)  =  0. We shall show that

[formula]

Since fm + 1(cm)  =  cmfm(cm)2 + 1  =  1  >  0 and fm + 1(x)  →    -    ∞   as x  →    -    ∞  , we have cm + 1  <  cm. For [formula], we have [formula], because cm  <  ck and [formula].

Define R(z)  =  z2  +  c. Let gn(c) be the constant term of n-th iteration Rn of R. Then gn + 1(c)  =  gn(c)2  +  c and g1(c)  =  c. Then we have gn(c)  =  cfn(c) by induction. Fix a natural number m  ≥  2 and let R(z)  =  z2  +  cm in particular. Since gn(cm) is the constant term of n-th iteration Rn of R, Rn(0)  =  gn(cm). Then Rm(0)  =  gm(cm)  =  cmfm(cm)  =  0. But for [formula], we have [formula].

Remark. The main theorem bellow shows that we can distinguish these examples of quadratic polynomials in terms of C*-algebras with gauge action, which could not be distinguished in our previous paper [\cite=IKW] where we counted only the numbers of extreme β-KMS states.

Let Q and R be rational functions with the degrees at least two. Suppose that there exists an isomorphism h:OQ()  →  OR() such that γR  =  hγQh- 1, where γQ and γR are the associated guage actions. Then their backward orbit structures given by the number of n-th backward orbit starting at the branched points are same, that is,

[formula]

Suppose that there exists an isomorphism h:OQ()  →  OR() such that γR  =  hγQh- 1. Then the fixed point algebras by the gauge actions are isomorphic, which will be denoted by B. Moreover the 1-spectral subspaces are isomorphic as Hilbert bi-module over B, which is denoted by Y. We should be careful that Hilbert bi-modules X over the coefficient algebra A  =  C() are not necessarily isomorphic. Therefore we should investigate invariants in terms of Hilbert bi-module Y over B.

We also note that deg  R  =   deg  Q = :N, since the number of extreme β-KMS states Ext(KMSβ(OX,γ)) for the gauge action γ on OX is exactly N  =   deg  R for β  >   deg  R, as in Theorem A in [\cite=IKW].

Fix β  >  N  =   deg  R. Put FX,β  =  e-  βFX. For a branched point z∈BR, let δz be the Dirac measure on [formula] corresponding to one point z. Define a trace τβ,z on A  =  C(), by

[formula]

where mβ,z is the normalized constant and given by

[formula]

Let E:OR()  →  OR()γ be the conditional expectation on to the fixed point algebra OR()γ by the gauge action defined by [formula]. By Theorem A in [\cite=IKW], there exists a unique β-KMS state φβ,z on OR() such that its restriction to A  =  C() is exactly τβ,z. Moreover the set of extreme β-KMS states has a bijective correspondence to the set BR of the branched points under the correspondence between φβ,z and z∈BR. The state satisfies that [formula] and

[formula]

Consider the fixed point algebra B  =  OR()γ by the gauge action γ. Let FY:Trace(B)  →  Trace(B) be the Perron-Frobenius operator associated with the 1-spectral subspace

[formula]

Define a sequence c(z)  =  (cn(z))n by

[formula]

which depends on only [formula] and φβ,z. Therefore the family {c(z) | z∈BR} of such sequences depends only on [formula] up to conjugacy. To make the proof finished, it is enough to show that the number bn(z) of the n-th backward orbit R- n(z) starting at z∈BR is described in terms of the sequence c(z)  =  (cn(z))n.

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

In general, since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

By a similar argument we have a theorem on the C*-algebra OR(JR) associated with a complex dynamical system (Rn)n restricted to the Julia set JR.

Let Q and R be rational functions with the degrees at least two. Suppose that there exists an isomorphism h:OQ(JQ)  →  OR(JR) such that γR  =  hγQh- 1, where γQ and γR are the associated guage actions. Then their backward orbit structures given by the number of n-th backward orbit starting at the branched points on the Julia sets are same, that is,

[formula]
