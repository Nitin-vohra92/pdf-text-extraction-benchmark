Generalization of the Goldenberg-Vaidman QKD Protocol

Introduction

Since the advent of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) in 1984 [\cite=bb84], several protocols for different cryptographic tasks have been proposed [\cite=ekert] [\cite=b92] [\cite=vaidman-goldenberg] [\cite=ping-pong] [\cite=Imoto]. In BB84-type protocols, the encoding and checking uses non-orthogonal states (conjugate coding) of an internal degree of freedom. By contrast, in the Goldenberg-Vaidman [\cite=vaidman-goldenberg] protocol (GV), the encoding is accomplished with orthogonal states consisting of superpositions of localized and geographically separated wave packets, and error checking is also done in the same basis. GV has recently been experimentally implemented [\cite=expGV].

Although most of the initial proposals [\cite=bb84] [\cite=ekert] [\cite=b92] [\cite=vaidman-goldenberg] on quantum cryptography were concentrated around QKD, it was soon realized that quantum states can be used for more complex and more specific cryptographic tasks. For example, in 1999, Shimizu and Imoto [\cite=Imoto] proposed a protocol for direct secured quantum communication using entangled photon pairs. In this type of protocols, unlike in BB84-type of protocols, secure quantum communication is possible without the intermediary generation of keys.

Such protocols of direct quantum communications are broadly divided into two classes: a) Protocols for deterministic secure quantum communication (DSQC) [\cite=review] and b) protocols for quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) [\cite=ping-pong] [\cite=lm05]. In DSQC, the receiver can read out the secret message only after the transmission of at least one bit of additional classical information for each qubit. By contrast, no such transmission of classical information is required in QSDC.

A large number of QSDC and DSQC protocols have been proposed in the recent past (cf. [\cite=review] and references therein). A common feature among these protocols is that they encode secret bits via orthogonal quantum states (so that the receiver can decode information unilaterally, as in QSDC, or with a 1-bit assist, as in DSQC), but exploit non-orthogonal states to detect eavesdropping and obtain the required security. The observation of this symmetry leads to the question of whether the use of non-orthogonal states can be entirely dispensed with in QSDC and DSQC. The present article aims to answer this question, in particular, by showing that the modified QSDC protocols obtained by giving up conjugate coding can be considered as a generalization of GV to multiparticle systems.

It is worth noting that the main difference between BB84-type protocols and GV pertains to the manner of error checking, rather than of encoding bits. For example, in BB84, Alice and Bob may deliberately decode only qubits of a given basis. In the Ping-pong (PP) [\cite=ping-pong] and Deng-Long-Liu (DLL) [\cite=Deng] protocols, which also belong to the BB84-class, encoding is done with orthogonal states, but error checking requires monitoring two non-commuting observables- in fact, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). By contrast, measurement in single basis is sufficient for the GV protocol.

As we clarify below, the security of BB84-class protocols arises from Heisenberg uncertainty, whereas that of GV (as also that of the recently proposed N09 protocol [\cite=n09]) arises ultimately from duality [\cite=duality], the trade-off between single-particle coherence and the particle's quantum correlation with another particle, i.e., the unshareability of quantum coherence/correlation. Later we present arguments that suggest that it is the single-particle analog of the monogamy of quantum correlations [\cite=monogamy].

In this work we identify other GV-class protocols, derived from existing QSDC protocols. After a general discussion on their security, we analyze their security under a simple error model, in which Eve is restricted to an incoherent single-qubit attack. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sec:GV], we briefly describe the GV protocol and demonstrate how its security arises from duality. We also discuss some features distinguishing this protocol from BB84-type protocols. In Section [\ref=sec:Turning-a-PP], we briefly describe the Ping-Pong protocol (PP) [\cite=ping-pong], which is a QSDC protocol, and show how to turn it into a GV-type QKD protocol (PPGV). The key point here is that the timing check of GV, fails, and must be replaced by some other method, which here is a reordering technique. A similar adaptation of the Cai-Li (CL) variant [\cite=cai-li] of PP is also given. In Section [\ref=sec:turning-deng-protocol], we briefly describe the Deng-Long-Liu protocol (DLL) for QSDC [\cite=Deng], and show how to modify it to a GV-class QKD protocol (DLLGV). The security of these generalized GV-type protocols, and in specific its origin in the monogamy of entanglement, is discussed in Section [\ref=sec:Security-analysis]. As an illustrative example, in Section [\ref=sec:attack], we consider a single-qubit error model, in which Eve is limited to an incoherent attack. Finally we dedicate Section [\ref=sec:Conclusions] to conclusions and discussions.

The GV protocol

The GV protocol works as follows: Let |0〉 and |1〉 be two localized wave packets of Alice' particle, represented by the qubit system S. They are used to construct two coding states, |ψj〉 (j = 1,2), obtained by the encoding operation:

[formula]

where j∈{0,1} represents the encoded bit. Alice sends Bob either |ψ0〉 or |ψ1〉 in such a way that |0〉 and |1〉 are not sent together, but along two different channels; |0〉 is sent first and |1〉 is delayed by time τ which is greater than the traveling time (θ) of particles from Alice to Bob. Thus |1〉 enters the channel only after |0〉 reaches Bob, and the two wave packets are never found together in the open. Bob delays |0〉 by time τ, and recreates the superposition state |ψj〉 after he receives |1〉. He repeats the encoding operation of Eq. ([\ref=eq:psij]) on |ψj〉 to recover j.

Alice and Bob perform the following two tests to detect Eve's possible malicious eavesdropping:

They compare the sending time ts with the receiving time tr for each wave packet. Since the traveling time is θ and the delay time is τ, we must have tr = ts  +  θ  +  τ. This ensures that Eve cannot delay |0〉 until also having |1〉 simultaneously, which would have allowed her to decode |ψj〉. Even so, she may replace both wave packets with a corresponding dummy. To avoid such an attack, the timing of transmission of |0〉 is kept random. Furthermore,

Alice and Bob look for changes in the data by comparing over an authenticated classical channel, a portion of the transmitted bits with the same portion of the received bits.

Because of the first of the above tests, Eve is unable to access the full state |ψj〉 and is restricted to attacking one packet at a time. Eve's perspective can be quite generally captured by introducing an ancilla or probe P that interacts with Alice's particle according to:

[formula]

where C0 and C1 are unitaries acting on the ancilla alone, conditioned on the channel that Alice's wave-packet is located in. Acting on the particle-ancilla system, this transforms an initial state [formula] (where |R〉 is the initial 'ready' state of the probe), after they are recombined by Bob using the encoding operation, to the state

[formula]

where [formula] and |d〉  =  C1|R〉. The probe is now left in the state:

[formula]

The optimal positive operator-valued measure (POVM) to measure the probe in order to distinguish the paths is given by the elements

[formula]

For this symmetric case, the two paths can be distinguished with probability [formula]. The off-diagonal term in the {|0〉,|1〉} basis in the reduced density operator of the particle ρP prior to recombination defines coherence and is given by C  =  |( - 1)j〈u|d〉|  =  |〈u|d〉|. It follows that the which-path information P and coherence satisfy the duality relation

[formula]

which is similar to the duality derived for path-distinguishability and visibility of interference of Ref. [\cite=duality]. More generally, allowing the ancilla to be in a possibly mixed state, then it can be shown that Eq. ([\ref=eq:duality]) is replaced by

[formula]

This is because the path distinguishability through optimization of the POVM is less efficient and coherence is a convex function of states.

The duality aspect of the GV protocol's security is reflected in the fact that Bob's checking involves measurement in only a single basis. By contrast, the security of BB84-class protocols is based on the disturbance introduced in a basis through measurements in another, non-commuting basis. Thus the security is ultimately due to Heisenberg uncertainty, and requires measurement in two or more non-commuting bases, which are ideally MUBs. To elaborate this point, we observe that P and C refer only to one observable, not to two non-commuting observables. Indeed, it follows from Eq. ([\ref=eq:mez]) that, upto a local transformation, the interaction is given by [formula], so that the probe measures the observable [formula] [\cite=gpsp07], and both P and C are defined in terms of [formula].

To use the terminology of wave-particle duality, the (legitimate) basis used by Alice and Bob observes the photon's 'wave nature'. Eve, on the other hand, is restricted to monitor particle nature. Of course, it is not in her interest to obtain which-way information, but the GV timing control means that she is effectively restricted to observe particle nature, and they can detect her action because of duality.

To contrast how security would arise from conjugate coding and hence Heisenberg uncertainty, we may expand GV to include, apart from |ψj〉, also as coding states, |0〉 and |1〉, encoding respectively for bit 0 and 1. We will call the latter the rectilinear basis [formula] and the former the diagonal basis [formula]. Eve's attempt to obtain information in one or the other basis is restricted by (the entropic version of) the uncertainty relation:

[formula]

where [formula], which is the relative entropy of the measured probability distribution with respect to a uniform distribution, denotes the entropic knowledge of measured outcomes m in a given basis [\cite=srisub09]. In this case, Eq. ([\ref=eq:uncertainty]) replaces Eq. ([\ref=eq:gduality]) as the essential equation guaranteeing security; the timing test 1 is no longer needed, but Bob would have to monitor both bases.

GV is a QKD protocol that cannot be directly used for QSDC. To see why, let us assume that instead of a random sequence of bits, Alice transmits a meaningful message to Bob by sending a sequence of |ψj〉's by following GV. When Alice sends |0〉, Eve can hold it and send a dummy |0〉 to Bob without causing any delay. Later, when |1〉 is sent by Alice, Eve holds that also and sends a dummy |1〉 to Bob in some state |ψk〉. Eve can appropriately superpose the original |0〉 and |1〉 and obtain the information encoded by Alice.

The security check 2 will eventually reveal the existence of Eve, but by then Eve will have already obtained the information transmitted so far. This leakage is not a problem with QKD because the distributed information is simply a random key that may be safely discarded if Eve is found to know too much about it.

Turning a PP protocol to a GV protocol, PPGV

All QKD protocols involve splitting of the information into two or more pieces, such that each piece by itself should be non-revealing of the encoded bit. This splitting of information can be done in several ways. For example, in GV, PP, CL [\cite=cai-li] and DLL protocols, the information is split into two quantum pieces but in BB84, B92 and particle-reordering-based protocols, the division is quantum-classical. Further, in GV and DLL, the quantum communication is one-way, while in PP it is two-way. In PP, Bob keeps one qubit from an entangled pair with him and sends the other qubit to Alice: the information split is thus across a 'tensor-product cut', while in GV it is across a 'tensor-sum cut'.

The original PP protocol is briefly described as below.

The CL protocol is just like PP, except that step PP3 is replaced by:

In a completely orthogonal-state-based protocol like GV, both error checking and encoding are done by using orthogonal states. PP employs orthogonal encoding, but error checking uses the BB84 subroutine with two (or more) non-commuting bases. To turn PP or CL into a GV-like protocol, which we call PPGV and CLGV, respectively, the error checking in them must be modified to employ only measurement in a single basis, given by that of the orthogonal encoding states, which is the Bell basis.

To implement this, both particles belonging to a pair must be sent across the channel. Although they are sent in a way as not to both be available at the same time in the channel, per the GV requirement, there is a new danger here not present in the original GV protocol. Eve can measure the position of the incoming qubits without disturbing the encoded information. This is essentially equivalent to having timing information in the GV protocol. Knowing the position of the qubits, Eve replaces the first qubit with a dummy, measures it jointly with the second qubit, and based on the state determined, sends a second dummy accordingly. Clearly, an error check cannot reveal this attack. This problem does not arise in the GV protocol, because the individual particles are spatially separated wave-packets of a single particle, whose wave function would collapse under a measurement of position (a particulate property), thereby producing a detectable disturbance.

To counter this, Bob randomly re-orders his qubits before transmission, revealing the reordering information only after Alice's receipt. Knowing the particle coordinates does not reveal to Eve which are the partner particles, and thus does not help Eve determine the encoded information, which, had it been successful, could have been used to decode the key/message and prepare noiseless dummies. We observe that reordering also means that the GV time control, which was required to physically separate legitimate particle pairs from Eve's perspective, is no longer needed. Thus reordering serves both the purpose of temporal separation and transmission timing randomization in the original GV protocol.

To obtain a GV-like protocol, we modify PP by replacing steps PP1, PP2 and PP4 as follows:

The other steps in PP remain the same. Similarly, in the CL protocol, replacing step CL1, CL2 and CL4 by PPGV1, PPGV2 and PPGV4 gives the GV version of CL, denoted CLGV.

Briefly, security in PPGV and CLGV arise as follows. The reordering has the same effect as time control and time randomization in GV. Eve is unable to apply a 2-qubit operation on legitimate partner particles to determine the encoding inspite of their orthogonality. Any correlation she generates by interacting with individual particles will diminish the observed correlations between Alice and Bob because of restrictions on shareability quantum correlations. We return to this point in greater detail in Section [\ref=sec:Security-analysis].

At best, Eve can either entangle a sufficiently large system with the transmitted 3n / 2 qubits, or replace them altogether 3n / 2 dummies. The problem Eve faces is that through only local operations she should be able to collapse any n of the transmitted particles into an ordered state of n / 2 pairs in the state |Ψ+〉, which has exponentially low probability of success.

PPGV (CLGV) also serves as a 2-way 4-step QSDC protocol. Note that PPGV, is a QSDC protocol that requires only two encoding states. Traditionally it has been believed that while two non-orthogonal states are sufficient for QKD, at least 4 states are required for implementation of DSQC or QSDC. That is true for conjugate coding based protocols. For example, we may consider B92 protocol which is the only well-known 2-state QKD protocol. This protocol cannot be generalized to a QSDC protocol because Bob's outcome will not be perfectly correlated with Alice's input. Thus we have provided here the first ever 2-state protocol of QSDC and also the first ever orthogonal state based protocol of QSDC. These observations are motivating enough to explore the possibility of converting other existing conjugate-coding-based protocols of DSQC and QSDC to GV type protocol. In the next Section we modify DLL protocol into a GV protocol.

Turning DLL protocol to a GV protocol, DLLGV

We have already mentioned that the CL protocol is a modified PP protocol that uses full power of dense coding. This simple idea of inclusion of dense coding to increase the efficiency of secure direct communication has considerably influenced the recent developments of QSDC and DSQC protocols. To be precise, DLL [\cite=Deng] can be viewed as modified CL in which the 2-way, 2-step quantum communication is 'unfolded' to a 1-way 2-step communication that uses dense coding. The DLL protocol is briefly described below.

The DLL protocol

Presenting the DLL protocol in this way helps us to visualize the inherent symmetry among PP, CL and DLL protocols.

The modified DLL protocol, DLLGV

Based on reasoning analogous to turning PP to PPGV, we propose the following GV-like version of DLL, which may be called DLLGV. As before, we retain the steps of DLL, replacing only steps DLL1, DLL2 and DLL4 as follows:

Security analysis: Duality and monogamy

Suppose Eve aims to extract information by measuring Alice's qubits A in some basis. She can do so by having a probe interact with Alice's qubit and measuring the probe suitably. We assume the interaction between her probe in initial state |E〉, and Alice's particle as given by:

[formula]

where cos 2θ ([formula]) is the probability that Eve is not detected when Alice transmits |0〉 (|1〉) and Bob measures in the [formula] basis. For Eve to obtain maximum information, we require 〈ε0|ε1〉  =  0 to ensure complete distinguishability. The requirement that she produces no errors entails that θ = 0.

Now, if Alice sends a state in the diagonal MUB [formula], then the resulting two-particle state is [formula], implying that Bob receives the maximally mixed state [formula]. By measuring in the diagonal basis, Alice and Bob detect an outcome completely uncorrelated with Alice's classical input, allowing them to infer maximally Eve's intervention. Clearly, the optimal attack in one basis produces maximal error in the other (mutually unbiased) basis. The errors produced in the two bases are governed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

[formula]

where H is the Shannon bi-partite entropy of the measured outcomes, which is the more familiar variant of Eq. ([\ref=eq:uncertainty]). This implies that if the disturbance generated by measurement in one basis vanishes, then that generated by measurement in the other basis is 1 bit, i.e., the output is totally uncorrelated with the input.

However, this form of error checking is disallowed in our case by virtue of our requirement that, in the manner of GV, conjugate bases should not be used: only one basis figures in the checking. Security in our case comes from the fact that Eve cannot access the full scope of 2-qubit operators. She is constrained to interact with the system qubits individually, and thus generates 3-particle entanglement, which by virtue of entanglement monogamy [\cite=monogamy], suppresses the two-party entanglement observed by Alice and Bob. Intuitively, this unshareability of quantum correlations can be understood as follows. Suppose A and B are in a maximally entangled pure state |Ψ+〉, and B is entangled with a third particle E. This entails that the joint bipartite system AB will be in a mixed state, contradicting our initial assumption of state purity.

Alice and Bob detect this reduction in their two-partite entanglement as a drop in the fidelity in Bob's subsequent Bell-state measurerment. In the above example, setting 〈ε0|ε1〉  =  θ  =  0, the 3-party entanglement generated is [formula], which is of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) kind [\cite=ghz]. It possesses maximal tri-partite entanglement, as quantified by the 3-tangle, [formula], where E(X|Y) denotes the tangle, the square of the concurrence between system X and Y [\cite=monogamy], a measure of bi-partite entanglement. For states belonging to the stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) class GHZ, τ  >  0, while for the other SLOCC class of three qubits, the W states, τ  =  0 [\cite=pranaw10]. Thus, quite generally, the bi-partite entanglement that Alice's qubit A shares with Bob's qubit B and E is constrained by:

[formula]

where the r.h.s is bounded above by 1 bit for a 3-qubit system. This implies that the entanglement generated by Eve to learn the encoded information diminishes E(A|B), and thus the quantum correlation observed by Bob in his Bell-state measurement.

Like duality, monogamy essentially refers only to a single basis, the Bell basis, {|Φj〉}, given by [formula] and [formula]. All quantities in Eq. ([\ref=eq:3tangle]) can be defined in this basis and also determined by measurement in this basis. For a pure bipartite state, [formula], concurrence is given by [formula], and the entanglement of formation by [formula] [\cite=entform].

As a matter of foundational interest, the observation that monogamy of entanglement protects secrecy in the generalized GV protocol suggests that monogamy may be regarded as the multipartite equivalent of duality. This is consistent with the observation that these protocols require measurement in only a single fixed basis, and not in two or more non-commuting bases. Further, duality can be expressed as a kind of unshareability of a quantum resource, namely the combination of a system's coherence or purity and its nonlocal correlation with any other particle.

We may then nominally try to re-express duality relation Eq. ([\ref=eq:gduality]) as a monogamy relation of the qubit system S with itself and the probe P:

[formula]

where, it should be noted, not all terms are obviously related to tangle or 3-tangle. We will examine two different interpretations, one based on entropy and the other on trace, under which to make sense of Eq. ([\ref=eq:dmonogamy]). In both cases, E(S|P) will be a measure of entanglement, E(S|S) a measure of the particle's coherence or purity, and E(S|SP) quantifies a notion that encompasses a particle's entanglement and coherence/purity. Thus, Eq. ([\ref=eq:dmonogamy]) will quantify the intuition that the coherence of a particle can't be shared, because entanglement will decohere the particle's state, making it incoherent or mixed.

Assuming that the two-particle state is pure, it follows from Eq. ([\ref=eq:detector]) that the entropy of entanglement of the system PA is given by the monotonically increasing function H(P / 2) of P. Thus in Eq. ([\ref=eq:dmonogamy]), we set:

[formula]

Positing that the coherence term E(S|S) has the same functional form of C as E(S|P) has of P, we have:

[formula]

which, for the pure state case, is just [formula]. The upper bound for the duality-as-monogamy equation ([\ref=eq:dmonogamy]) is found by maximizing the l.h.s with the identifications in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:ptangle]) and ([\ref=eq:p1tangle]), which turns out to be about 1.62, occuring at P = 0.5. We identify this upper bound with the maximum of the quantity E(S|SP), which is interpreted as a joint entanglement-cum-coherence quantum resource. It can be shown that, in general when the two-particle state is mixed, this is a strict upper bound to the l.h.s of Eq. ([\ref=eq:dmonogamy]) under this interpretation, since both path distinguishability P and system coherence C are convex functions of probe purity.

As another interpretation, again assuming a pure state of the bipartite system, we quantify E(S|P) by the mixedness [formula] of the system or, equivalently, of the probe, and [formula] by purity of the system, (ρ2S). In this case, we have the equality ([\ref=eq:dmonogamy]), E(S|P)  +  E(S|S)  =  1. More generally, given an initial mixed state of the probe, we quantify entanglement by the mimimum, T min, averaged over all pure states in ensembles that realize it, and E(S|S) by the corresponding average purity. In this case, we have E(S|P)  +  E(S|S)  ≤  1, where the r.h.s may be considered as an upper bound on E(S|SP), now interpreted as the system's extended coherence, the combined entanglement-cum-purity of system S.

Thus, the origin of security in GV and its generalizations is ultimately not Heisenberg uncertainty, but unshareability of quantum coherence/correlation, a generalized monogamy. The extension of the GV protocol has the foundational significance of suggesting that duality and monogamy are facets of the same underlying quantum phenomenon [\cite=mono]. As with GV, this highlights the fundamental difference in the origin of security of the GV-class and BB84-class of protocols.

Incoherent single-qubit attack: an example

By way of illustrating the practical application of the generalized GV protocols, we compute the tolerable error rate in the following simplified scenario, where Eve is limited to an incoherent attack using the one-qubit error model. As is usually done, any error observed by Alice and Bob is attributed to a putative Eve's intervention. However, as errors can arise also due to channel noise, to abort a protocol run in every detection of error would be practically unfeasible. Instead Alice and Bob need to model Eve's attack strategy, and estimate whether the Eve's information on their secret bits, as a function of observed noise, is too high to be eliminated by subsequent classical post-processing. If it is, only then do they abort the protocol run.

As a specific example of the attack employed by Eve, we consider a model given in Ref. [\cite=zbi], which is based on error models proposed by Niu and Griffiths [\cite=NiuGri]. Probes E0 an E1 interact with each transmitted qubit, being subjected to the interaction:

[formula]

where, furthermore 〈ε0|ε1〉  =  〈E0|E1〉  =   cos θ by virtue of symmetry in the attack strategy [\cite=NiuGri]. An outline of a more general security proof is as follows. After some straightforward, but rather tedious calculation, the above attack can be shown to produce the reduced density operator

[formula]

Bi-partite correlation are quantified by the fidelity [formula]. It follows that in order to produce no errors, Eve must ensure that θ = 0, which by virtue of Eq. ([\ref=eq:niugri]), implies that no entanglement is generated, and in fact |ε0〉  =  |ε1〉, implying a trivial interaction of the probe with Alice's qubit.

The error rate observed by Alice and Bob is given by:

[formula]

where Φ∈{Φ±〉,|Ψ±〉} and [formula] is the corresponding two-particle state obtained assuming Eve attacks fraction λ or the incoming particles with eavesdropping parameter θ. Bob's information IB is quantified as the Alice-Bob mutual information I(A:B) based on e (Fig. [\ref=fig:BobEvesInfo]A). Eve's information is upper-bounded by the Holevo bound χ of the reduced density operator of the two probes (Fig. [\ref=fig:BobEvesInfo] B).

The tolerable error rate is computed as:

[formula]

the smallest error for which IB just exceeds χ. It may be considered as the problem of minimizing e subject to the constraint that Eve's information has zero excess over Bob's. Numerically, this is obtained as the points along the 'cliff' in the binary map depicted in Fig. [\ref=fig:errorrate] A. Multiplying this with the error map produces a corresponding 'error cliff'. The required e0 is obtained as the minimum e along this cliff. For the considered model, we found the tolerable error rate e0 = 26.7%, as seen in Figure [\ref=fig:errorrate] B. This rather large tolerance is obviously due to the limited power of Eve's attack here.

A similar analysis can be done for PP and CL, which yield tolerable error rates to be about 25% and for DLL, about 26%. Thus none of protocols offers, from the perspective of security against single-qubit attacks, an especial advantage over the others. It is an interesting question whether this remains true for more general attacks.

Conclusions and Discussions

The possibility of orthogonal-state-based QKD protocols prompts us to revisit the foundations of quantum cryptography, in order to understand the ultimate origin of secrecy in the quantum world. It now appears that security arises in quantum cryptography in two (possibly related) ways: Heisenberg uncertainty and duality/monogamy. We have shown that the GV protocol generalizations can be obtained by adapting existing QSDC schemes. The possibility of this generalization offers the foundational insight into the essential unity of duality and monogamy.

The pair reordering technique used here can also be applied to the original GV protocol. For the same reason as with the generalized GV protocols, this helps eliminate the need for time control. The incoming packets are stored in quantum memory, and analyzed after appropriate pairing based on the classical communication from Alice.
