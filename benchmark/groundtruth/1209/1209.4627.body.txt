Positively curved metrics on symmetric spaces with large symmetry rank

A well known conjecture of Hopf states that S2  ×  S2 admits no metric of positive sectional curvature. More generally, one might ask whether any nontrivial product manifold admits a metric with positive sectional curvature.

Another way to generalize this conjecture of Hopf is to observe that S2  ×  S2 is a rank two symmetric space. While the compact, simply connected rank one symmetric spaces, i.e., Sn, [formula], [formula], and [formula], admit metrics with positive sectional curvature, it is conjectured that no symmetric space of rank greater than one admits such a metric. Our first main result provides evidence for this conjecture under the assumption of symmetry:

Recall that the symmetry rank is defined as the rank of the isometry group. The assumption that the symmetry rank is at least r is equivalent to the existence of an effective, isometric Tr-action on M.

If we restrict to the case where N is an irreducible symmetric space, then product manifolds are excluded, so the only possibilities are that N has rank one or that N is a rank two or rank three real Grassmannian. See Theorem [\ref=thmSymSps] for a more detailed statement. For example, N cannot be Sk  ×  Sn - k with 1  <  k  <  16.

One might compare this result to Theorem 5 in [\cite=Wilking03], which implies that, for a field k and a closed, simply connected n-manifold M with positive sectional curvature, if M has n  ≥  6000 and symmetry rank at least [formula], then H*(M;k) is isomorphic to that of a rank one symmetric space, [formula], or [formula].

The obstruction (see Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro]) we prove in order to obtain Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM] is at the level of rational cohomology in small degrees. Since taking products with spheres does not affect cohomology in small degrees, and since the Grassmannians SO(2 + q) / SO(2)  ×  SO(q) and SO(3 + q) / SO(3)  ×  SO(q) have the same rational cohomology ring in small degrees as the complex and quaternionic projective spaces, respectively, our methods cannot exclude them.

The second main result is related to the Bott conjecture and a second conjecture of Hopf. Recall that the Bott conjecture states that a nonnegatively curved manifold is rationally elliptic, which, in paticular, implies that the Euler characteristic is positive if and only if the odd Betti numbers vanish. The conjecture of Hopf states that the Euler characteristic of an even-dimensional, positively curved manifold is positive. Hence the conjectures together would imply that even-dimensional, positively curved manifolds have vanishing odd Betti numbers. The second part of the following theorem provides some evidence for this statement:

In order to explain our main topological result, which is the crucial step in proving Theorems [\ref=symspsTHM] and [\ref=corBott], we make the following definition:

In particular, if x  ≠  0 in the definition, then [formula] for [formula]. However we abuse notation slightly by allowing x = 0, hence we say that a rationally (c - 1)-connected space has 4-periodic rational cohomology up to degree c.

Examples of n-manifolds with 4-periodic rational cohomology are Sn, [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula]. By taking a product of one of these spaces with any rationally (c - 1)-connected space, we obtain examples of spaces with 4-periodic rational cohomology up to degree c.

The main cohomological obstruction to the existence of positively curved metrics with large symmetry rank can now be stated as follows:

Taking c  =  16 and restricting to the situation where M has the rational cohomology of a compact symmetric space, we obtain Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM] as a corollary by comparing this obstruction with the classification of symmetric spaces. See Section [\ref=symsps] for details.

Another, more immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro] follows by taking c = 10 and concluding that the Betti numbers of M satisfy b4(M)  =  b8(M)  ≤  1:

On the other hand, recall that such connected sums admit metrics, called Cheeger metrics, with nonnegative curvature (see [\cite=Cheeger73]).

A final corollary relates to a conjecture of Chern, which states that, for a positively curved manifold, every abelian subgroup of the fundamental group is cyclic. Examples given in [\cite=Shankar98] [\cite=Bazaikin99] [\cite=Grove-Shankar00] show that this conjecture is false. However modified versions of the Chern conjecture have been verified under the addtional assumption that the symmetry rank is at least a linear function of the dimension (see [\cite=Rong02] [\cite=Wilking03] [\cite=Frank-Rong-Wang??pre] [\cite=Wang07]).

We use many ideas from [\cite=Wilking03] [\cite=Kennard12pre], including Wilking's connectedness theorem in [\cite=Wilking03] and the periodicity theorem in [\cite=Kennard12pre]. These theorems place restrictions on the cohomology of a closed, positively curved manifold in the presence of totally geodesic submanifolds of small codimension (see Section [\ref=Preliminaries]). Since fixed-point sets of isometries are totally geodesic, these become powerful tools in the presence of symmetry. The connection made in [\cite=Wilking03] to the theory of error-correcting codes also plays a role. Here we will use the Griesmer bound, which is well suited to the logarithmic symmetry rank bound with which we are working.

The proofs of our results involve a stronger version of Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro], namely Theorem [\ref=thmP]. It states that, under the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro], there exists a c-connected inclusion N  ⊆  M of a compact submanifold N such that [formula] is 4-periodic. Moreover, one can ensure that [formula]. The advantage of this statement is that one can apply Poincaré duality to conclude the following about N:

the subring of [formula] made up of elements of even degree is isomorphic to that of Sm, [formula], [formula], or [formula], and

if [formula], then N has vanishing odd-dimensional cohomology.

For i < c, the map [formula] induced by inclusion is an isomorphism, so one can use these observations to conclude Theorem [\ref=corBott]. The corollary above about the Chern conjecture follows in a similar way but is a little more involved. It is proven in the discussion following Theorem [\ref=thmP].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=Preliminaries], we quote some preliminary results and prove a lemma using the Griesmer bound. In Section [\ref=P], we prove Theorems [\ref=thmP] and [\ref=thmP-intro]. In Section [\ref=symsps], we study the topological obstructions imposed by Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro] and prove Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM].

Preliminaries and the Griesmer bound

An important result for this work is Wilking's connectedness theorem:

Suppose Mn is a closed Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature.

If Nn - k is connected and totally geodesic in M, then [formula] is (n - 2k  +  1)-connected.

If Nn - k11 and Nn - k22 are totally geodesic with k1  ≤  k2, then [formula] is (n  -  k1  -  k2)-connected.

Recall an inclusion [formula] is called h-connected if πi(M,N) = 0 for all i  ≤  h. It follows from the relative Hurewicz theorem that the induced map [formula] is an isomorphism for i < h and a surjection for i = h. The following is a topological consequence of highly connected inclusions of closed, orientable manifolds:

Let Mn and Nn - k be closed, orientable manifolds. If [formula] is (n - k - l)-connected with n - k - 2l > 0, then there exists [formula] such that the maps [formula] given by x  ↦  ex are surjective for l  ≤  i < n - k - l and injective for l < i  ≤  n - k - l.

In particular, in the case where l  =  0, the integral cohomology of M is k-periodic according to the following definition:

For a space M, a coefficient ring R, and a positive integer c, we say that H*(M;R) is k-periodic up to degree c if there exists x∈Hk(M;R) such that the map Hi(M;R)  →  Hi + k(M;R) given by y  ↦  xy is a surjection for i = 0, an isomorphism for 0  <  i  <  c - k and an injection for i  =  c - k.

If, in addition, M is a c-dimensional, closed, R-orientable manifold, then we say that H*(M;R) is k-periodic.

In [\cite=Kennard12pre], the action of the Steenrod algebra was exploited to prove the following:

Let Nn be a closed, simply connected Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature. Let Nn - k11 and Nn - k22 be totally geodesic, transversely intersecting submanifolds.

If 2k1  +  2k2  ≤  n, then the rational cohomology rings of N, N1, N2, and [formula] are gcd (4,k1)-periodic.

If 3k1  +  k2  ≤  n, and if N2 is simply connected, then the rational cohomology rings of N2 and [formula] are gcd (4,k1)-periodic.

We next record two additional results concerning torus actions on positively curved manifolds:

Suppose T is a torus acting by isometries on an compact, positively curved manifold Mn. If n is even, then the fixed-point set MT is nonempty, and if n is odd, then a codimension one subtorus has nonempty fixed-point set.

If T is a torus acting effectively by isometries on a compact, positively curved manifold Mn, then [formula]. Moreover, if equality holds and M is simply connected, then M is diffeomorphic to Sn or [formula].

Finally, we use the Griesmer bound from the theory of error-correcting codes to prove the following proposition. The estimates are specifically catered to our application. The proof indicates the general bounds required.

Let n  ≥  c  ≥  2. Assume Ts acts effectively by isometries on a positively curved n-manifold Nn with fixed point x. Let δ(n) be 0 if n is even and 1 if n is odd.

If

[formula]

then there exists an involution σ∈Ts such that the component Nσx of the fixed-point set of σ that contains x satisfies [formula] and [formula].

Let σ be an involution as above such that Nσx has minimal positive codimension. If

[formula]

then there exists an involution τ∈Ts satisfying [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula].

By the connectedness theorem, the inclusions [formula] and [formula] are c-connected. Since c  ≥  2, this implies that all three submanifolds are 1-connected. In particular, [formula] where 〈σ,τ〉 is the subgroup generated by σ and τ.

The only part in the proof where we use positive curvature is to conclude that, in the first statement, the bound on s and the assumption n  ≥  c  ≥  2 implies n  ≥  11 by Theorem [\ref=Grove-Searle]. Given this, the bound on s implies

[formula]

We also observe that the bound in the second statement implies

[formula]

We proceed to the proof. We require the following algebraic lemma:

If n  ≥  c  ≥  2 and [formula], then

[formula]

We proceed by contradiction. Suppose the opposite inequality holds. The bounds n, c, and r imply that [formula] and that [formula], hence we may split the sum into two pieces and estimate as follows:

[formula]

Calculating the geometric sum and rearranging, this implies

[formula]

Observing that the integers n, c, and n - c + 1 cannot all be even, we conclude that the term in parentheses is at least 1, hence taking logarithms yields a contradiction to the assumed bound on r.

We proceed to the proof of Proposition [\ref=Griesmer].

Choose a basis of TxM such that the image of [formula] under the isotropy representation [formula] lies in a copy of [formula] where [formula]. Endow [formula] with a [formula]-vector space structure, and consider now the linear embedding [formula].

Consider the first statement. The bound on s and the assumption n  ≥  c  ≥  2 imply s  ≥  2. Consider the composition of [formula], where the last map takes [formula] to [formula]. There exists [formula] inside the kernel, and for each [formula], [formula] is twice the even weight of ι(σ) = τ. Hence it suffices to prove the existence of [formula] with [formula].

Suppose now that no such σ exists. Then every [formula] has [formula]. Equivalently, the Hamming weight of the image of every [formula] is at least [formula]. We now apply the Griesmer bound from the theory of error-correcting codes:

This bound implies

[formula]

By the comments following the statement of Proposition [\ref=Griesmer], we have

[formula]

hence we have a contradiction to Lemma [\ref=lemAlgLem], as desired.

We now prove the second statement of Proposition [\ref=Griesmer]. First, observe that the lower bound on s implies s  ≥  4. Let [formula] be as in the statement. We define three linear maps [formula]. For the first, fix a component i such that the i-th component of ι(σ) is 1 (which corresponds to a normal direction of Nσx), and define the map [formula] as the projection onto the i-th component of ι(τ). For the second map, assign [formula] to the sum of the components of ι(τ) (as we did previously to choose σ). And for the third map, let I be the subset of indices i where the i-th component of ι(σ) is 0, and define the map by assigning [formula] to the sum over i∈I of the i-th components of ι(τ). The intersection of the kernels of these three maps contains a [formula], and every [formula] satisfies [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Moreover, the image of every [formula] has a 0 in the i-th component of [formula], hence we have an injective linear map [formula] where twice the weight of the image of [formula] is equal to [formula].

It therefore suffices to prove that the element in [formula] whose image has minimal weight has weight at most [formula]. Proceeding again by contradiction, we assume this is not the case and conclude from the Griesmer bound that

[formula]

The bound on s implies that the i  =  s - 3 term in the sum would be 1, hence we may add one to both sides of this inequality to conclude

[formula]

As established after the statement of Proposition [\ref=Griesmer], the bound on s implies

[formula]

so we have another contrdiction to Lemma [\ref=lemAlgLem]. This concludes the proof of Proposition [\ref=Griesmer].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro]

In this section, we use the following notation:

For integers n, let δ(n) be 0 if n is even and 1 if n is odd. And for c  ≥  2, let

[formula]

Given an isometric action of an r-torus on a closed, positively curved n-manifold with [formula], Theorem [\ref=Berger] implies that a subtorus of dimension r - δ(n)  ≥  fc(n) has a fixed point. Using this, one can conclude Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro] from the following:

Let n  ≥  c  ≥  2. Assume Mn is a closed, simply connected, positively curved manifold, and assume a torus T acts effectively by isometries with dim (T)  ≥  fc(n). For all x∈MT, there exists H  ⊆  T such that [formula] is 4-periodic and the inclusion [formula] is c-connected.

Moreover, H may be chosen to satisfy [formula], dim MHx  ≥  c, and the property that every free group action π  ×  M  →  M commuting with the action of T restricts to a π-action on MHx.

Here, and throughout this section, we use the notation MH to denote the fixed-point set of H, and we write MHx for the component of MH containing x.

In the case where M is not simply connected, we consider the universal cover [formula] of M. The torus action on M induces an action by a torus T̃ of the same dimension on [formula]. Moreover, the fundamental group π  =  π1(M) acts freely on [formula] and its action on [formula] commutes with the action of T̃. Theorem [\ref=thmP] now implies that there exists a c-connected inclusion [formula] such that π acts (freely) on N, N has 4-periodic rational cohomology, and [formula].

In the case where [formula], 4-periodicity and Poincaré duality imply that N is a simply connected rational homology sphere. This proves the corollary stated in the introduction. Similarly, if [formula], the conclusion is that π1(M) acts freely on a simply connected rational homology sphere or a simply connected rational [formula].

We spend the rest of this section on the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmP]. First observe that n  ≥  c  ≥  2 implies

[formula]

for 2  ≤  n  ≤  5, hence the theorem is true in low dimensions by Theorem [\ref=Grove-Searle]. Simply take H to be the identity subgroup of T.

Since the result holds in dimensions less than six, we may proceed by induction. We spend the rest of this section proving the induction step. For this purpose, we assume the following:

c  ≥  2,

M is a closed, simply connected, positively curved n-manifold with n  ≥  c,

T is a torus acting effectively by isometries on M with dim (T)  ≥  fc(n), and

x is a fixed point in MT.

To put what we are trying to prove in a simpler light, we make the following definition:

Let c, M, T, and x be as above. Denote by C the set of MHx where H  ⊆  T ranges over subgroups such that

the inclusion [formula] is c-connected,

[formula],

dim MHx  ≥  c, and

every free group action π  ×  M  →  M commuting with the action of T restricts to a π-action on MHx.

Observe that our goal is to prove the following:

There exists MHx∈C with 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Our first step is to draw a conclusion from our induction hypothesis. To state the lemma, we require one more definition:

For a submanifold N  ⊆  M on which T acts, let ker (T|N)  ⊆  T denote the kernel of the induced T-action on N. Also let [formula], that is, the dimension of the kernel of the induced T-action on N.

Since M and T are fixed, the quantity [formula] is well defined. We now put our induction hypothesis to use:

Some MHx∈C has 4-periodic rational cohomology, or the following holds: For all Q,N∈C with Q  ⊆  N  ⊆  M and dim Q  <  n,

[formula] and

if [formula], then

[formula]

Suppose for a moment that there exists S∈C such that dim S  <  n and [formula]. Then T /  ker (T|S) is a torus acting effectively on S with dimension

[formula]

Since dim S  <  n, the induction hypothesis implies the existence of an H'  ⊆  T /  ker (T|S) such that

SH'x has 4-periodic rational cohomology,

[formula] is c-connected,

[formula],

dim SH'x  ≥  c, and

every free group action π  ×  S  →  S that commutes with the action of T /  ker (T|S) restricts to a π-action on SH'x.

Letting H be the inverse image of H' under the quotient map T  →  T /  ker (T|S), we conclude that SH'x  =  MHx. Moreover, since S∈C, we have MHx∈C. Hence MHx∈C and has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

We may assume therefore that no such S exists. Letting Q and N be as in the assumption of the lemma, we immediately obtain the estimate [formula]. The second estimate on dim Q follows directly from the first together with the estimate on k.

Since our goal is to prove that some MHx∈C has 4-periodic rational cohomology, we assume from now on the second statement of Lemma [\ref=lemI].

We next begin the study of fixed-point sets of involutions. Using Proposition [\ref=Griesmer], we prove the following:

There exists an involution σ∈T such that Mσx∈C, [formula], and [formula].

Recall that x∈M has been fixed. Also recall that dim (T)  ≥  fc(n). By the first part of Proposition [\ref=Griesmer], there exists σ∈T satisfying [formula] and [formula]. By choosing σ among all such involutions so that [formula] is minimal, we ensure that [formula]. It remains to show that Mσx  =  M〈σ〉x∈C.

First, the bound on [formula] and the connectedness theorem implies that [formula] is c-connected. Second, our choice of σ implies [formula]. Third, the bound [formula] and the fact that n  ≥  c imply that [formula]. Finally, the assumption that c  ≥  2 implies that [formula]. By the connectedness theorem, Mσx is the unique component of Mσ with dimension at least n / 2, which implies that every π-action on M that commutes with T preserves Mσx and hence restricts to a π-action on Mσx. These conclusions imply Mσx∈C.

Using the periodicity theorem, we can sharpen the conclusion of Lemma [\ref=lemII] to the following:

Some MHx∈C has 4-periodic rational cohomology, or there exists an involution σ∈T such that Mσx∈C and [formula].

Choose σ∈T as in the previous lemma. If, in fact, [formula], then Lemma [\ref=lemI] implies

[formula]

Otherwise, there exists a 2-torus inside T which fixes Mσx. It follows that there exists another involution ι∈T such that Mσx  ⊆  Mιx  ⊆  M with both inclusions strict. Since ι and σ are involutions in T, it follows that Mσx is the transverse intersection of Mιx and Mισx. Since

[formula]

the periodicity theorem implies that [formula] is 4-periodic. Since [formula], this concludes the proof.

Since our goal is to prove that some MHx∈C has 4-periodic rational cohomology, this lemma allows us to assume without loss of generality that (M,σ) satisfies Property I according to the following definition:

We say that (N,σ) satisfies Property I if N∈C and σ is an involution in T /  ker (T|N) such that Nσx∈C and

[formula]

Here and throughout the rest of the proof, [formula] denotes the codimension of Q  ⊆  R. As established before the definition, there exists at least one pair satisfying Property I . We focus our attention on a particular minimal pair. Specifically, among pairs (N,σ) satisfying Property I with minimal dim N, we choose one with minimal [formula].

With N fixed, we will denote by [formula] the quotient of T by the kernel ker (T|N) of the induced T-action on N. Observe that [formula] acts effectively on N and has dimension [formula]. Moreover, we wish to emphasize that the involution σ lies in [formula].

The strategy for the rest of the proof is to choose a second involution in [formula] in a certain minimal way, analyze the consequences of our minimal choices to prove Lemma [\ref=lemIII] below, then to conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmP].

To begin, we prove the following:

There exists an involution [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover, given any such τ, the submanifolds Nτx, Nστx, and N〈σ,τ〉x lie in C.

The existence of such a τ follows from Proposition [\ref=Griesmer] once we establish that

[formula]

Moreover, we see that this is the case by combining the following facts:

[formula] by definition of [formula],

dim (T)  ≥  fc(n) by assumption,

δ( dim N)  =  δ(n) because [formula], and

[formula] because (N,σ) satisfying Property I implies that [formula].

For the second claim, let τ be any involution satisfying satisfying these properties. We wish to show that Nτx, Nστx, and N〈σ,τ〉x lie in C.

First let H  ⊆  T be such that N  =  MHx. If [formula] is the projection map, then Nτx  =  M〈H,p- 1(τ)〉x, where 〈H,p- 1(τ)〉 is the subgroup of T generated by H and p- 1(τ). Similarly, Nστx  =  M〈H,p- 1(στ)〉x and N〈σ,τ〉x  =  M〈H,p- 1(〈σ,τ〉)〉x.

Second, the inclusions [formula] are c-connected by the connectedness theorem together with the upper bounds on [formula] and [formula]. In particular, [formula] is connected, so we have [formula]. Also by the connectedness theorem, the inclusion [formula] is (c + 1)-connected. Since N∈C, this proves that the inclusions of Nτx, Nστx, and N〈σ,τ〉x into M are c-connected.

Third, the dimension of all three submanifolds is congruent to n modulo 4 since [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and finally

[formula]

Fourth, the dimension of all three submanifolds is at least that of M〈σ,τ〉x, which has dimension at least

[formula]

Finally, let π  ×  M  →  M be a free group action commuting with the T-action on M. We wish to show that the π-action restricts to π-actions on Nτx, [formula], and Nστx. This follows from the following observations:

By assumption, N∈C, so the π-action restricts to a π-action on N.

By assumption, the dimensions of Nσx and Nτx in N are at least [formula], hence the connectedness theorem implies that Nσx and Nτx are the unique such components of Nσ and Nτ, respectively. It follows that the π-action preserves Nσx and Nτx.

Since π preserves Nσx and Nτx, it also preserves [formula].

Since π preserves [formula], the fact that [formula] implies that π also preserves Nστx.

This concludes the proof that Nτx, Nστx, and N〈σ,τ〉x satisfy the requirements needed to be elements of C.

We now choose [formula] such that

[formula]

and

[formula]

and such that [formula] is minimal among all such choices.

Having chosen τ, we use the minimality of dim N and [formula] to obtain the following:

Both of the following hold:

[formula] or the intersection [formula] is transverse in N.

[formula] with equality only if [formula] is not transverse in N.

We prove the first statement by contradiction. We assume therefore that [formula] and that [formula] is not transverse. The first assumption implies that [formula] has dimension at least [formula]. Let [formula] denote the image of σ under the projection [formula], and observe that [formula]. The second assumption implies that the inclusion N〈σ,τ〉x  ⊆  Nστx has positive codimension. Moreover, this codimension is at most [formula] by the minimality of [formula]. Putting these facts together, we see that [formula] satisfies Property I . Since dim Nστx  <   dim N, this is a contradiction to the minimality of dim N.

Proceeding to the second statement, suppose for a moment that [formula]. Then there exits a 4-torus inside [formula] that fixes Nτx. It follows that we may choose an involution ι inside this 4-torus such that

[formula]

and Nτx  ⊆  Nιx  ⊆  N with both inclusions strict. Moreover, since [formula], it follows for free that [formula]. Hence we have a contradiction to the minimality of [formula], and we may conclude that [formula].

For the equality case, suppose that [formula] and that [formula] is transverse in N. Since a 3-torus inside [formula] fixes Nτx, we may choose an involution [formula] such that [formula] and Nτx  ⊆  Nιx  ⊆  N with all inclusions strict. Since [formula] is transverse, it follows that [formula] as well, hence we have another contradiction to the minimality of [formula].

We are ready to conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmP]. We do this by breaking the proof into cases and showing in each case that N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology. Since we have already established that N〈σ,τ〉x∈C, this would conclude the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmP]. The three cases are as follows:

Clearly one of these cases occurs, so our task will be complete once we show, in each case, that N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology. We assign each case its own lemma.

If [formula], then N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

First observe that [formula] since, by definition, [formula]. We may therefore choose an involution [formula] such that Nτx  ⊆  Nιx  ⊆  N with all inclusions strict. In addition, we may assume [formula] in the case where [formula]. Choose a basis for the tangent space TxN so that σ, τ, and ι have the following block representations

[formula]

where the blocks of have size b, a - b, k - a, m - b, (l - a)  -  (m - b), and dim N〈σ,τ〉x, where [formula], [formula], and [formula], and where [formula] and [formula]. Suppose for a moment that 0 < b  <  a. Then (Nστx)ιx and (Nστx)τιx intersect transversely in Nστx and have codimensions b and a - b, respectively. Observe that the intersection is N〈σ,τ〉x. The codimensions b and a - b are positive, and they satisfy

[formula]

by Lemmas [\ref=lemI] and [\ref=lemIII]. It follows from the periodicity theorem that N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Suppose now that b = 0 or b = a. It follows from Lemma [\ref=lemIII] that

[formula]

so the minimality of [formula] implies that both of these codimensions are congruent to 2 modulo 4. By our choice of ι, we must have that [formula] and hence that [formula]. Combining this with the assumption in this case, we conclude [formula] and [formula]. The first of these equalities implies N  =  M by Lemma [\ref=lemI]. Using Lemma [\ref=lemI] again, we conclude [formula]. This bound, the periodicity theorem, and the existence of the transverse intersection of Nιx and Nιτx inside N imply that [formula] is 4-periodic. Finally, Lemma [\ref=lemI] implies

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

It follows from the connectedness theorem that N〈σ,τ〉x also has 4-periodic rational cohomology. This concludes the proof in Case 1.

If [formula] and [formula] is not transverse, then N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

First observe that [formula] by the third statement of Lemma [\ref=lemIII], hence we may choose an involution [formula] such that Nστx  ⊆  Nιx  ⊆  N with all inclusions strict. Choose a basis for the tangent space TxN so that σ, τ, and ι have the following block representations

[formula]

where the blocks of have size a, b, k - a - b, m - b, (l - a)  -  (m - b), and dim N〈σ,τ〉x. Here k, l, m, a, and b have the same geometric meaning as in Case 1. The difference is hidden in the order of the blocks, which indicate that Nστx  ⊆  Nιx in this case while Nτx  ⊆  Nιx in Case 1.

Observe that a > 0 because [formula] is not transverse. In addition, observe that the assumption in this case implies 2k + l  ≤  n by Lemma [\ref=lemI]. Finally, by replacing ι by ιστ if necessary, we may assume that [formula].

First suppose b  >  0. Then (Nτx)ιx and (Nτx)σιx intersect transversely in Nτx with intersection Nστιx. Since the codimensions b and k - a - b, respectively, are positive and satisfy

[formula]

the periodicity theorem implies that [formula] has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Now suppose b = 0. Then (Nστιx)σx and (Nστιx)στx intersect transversely inside Nστιx with codimensions a > 0 and m. Using the estimates a  ≤  k and 2k + l  ≤  n, it follows that

[formula]

By the periodicity theorem, [formula] once again has 4-periodic rational cohomology. This concludes the proof in Case 2.

If [formula] and [formula] is transverse, then N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Let [formula] and [formula]. As in the proof of Case 2, we have 2k  +  l  ≤  n.

First we consider the case where [formula]. This implies the existence of an involution [formula] such that Nτx  ⊆  Nιx  ⊆  N with all inclusions strict. By replacing ι by τι if necessary, we may assume that its codimension m satisfies [formula]. Since [formula] is transverse, [formula] is as well. Since the codimensions of this transverse intersection satisfy

[formula]

the periodicity theorem implies that N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Second we consider the case where

[formula]

This implies the existence of an [formula] such that [formula] and such that

[formula]

with all inclusions strict. It follows that (Nτx)ιx and (Nιx)σιx intersect transversely in Nτx and have codimensions, say, b and k - b. Since

[formula]

the periodicity theorem implies N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Third, we consider the case where [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lemI] implies dim Nτx  ≥  3k, hence 3k + l  ≤  n. Since Nσx and Nτx intersect transversely, the periodicity theorem implies N〈σ,τ〉x has 4-periodic rational cohomology.

Finally, if none of these three possibilities occurs, the assumption in this case implies that [formula], [formula], and [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=lemI], we can further conclude N  =  M and [formula]. Hence

[formula]

so the periodicity theorem applied to the transverse intersection of Nσx and Nτx implies that [formula] is 4-periodic. This concludes the proof of Case 3, and hence concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmP].

From Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro] to Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM]

The proof of Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM] contains three steps. The first step classifies 1-connected, compact, irreducible symmetric spaces whose rational cohomology either is 4-periodic up to degree 16 or has the property that [formula] for 3 < i < 16. The second step is a lemma about product manifolds whose rational cohomology is 4-periodic up to degree 16. The final step combines these lemmas to classify 1-connected, compact symmetric spaces whose rational cohomology is 4-periodic up to degree 16. From Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro], these results immediately imply Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM].

The first relevant lemma concerning 1-connected, compact, irreducible symmetric spaces is the following:

Assume Mn is a 1-connected, compact, irreducible symmetric space. Let c  ≥  16 and n  ≥  16 be integers. If [formula] is 4-periodic up to degree c, then M is one of the following: Sn, [formula], [formula], SO(2 + q) / SO(2)  ×  SO(q), or SO(3 + q') / SO(3)  ×  SO(q') where q  =  n / 2 and q' = n / 3.

Observe that periodicity up to degree c  ≥  16 implies that M either is rationally (c - 1)-connected or has the property that [formula] for 4i  ≤  c. Since c  ≥  16 we may as well assume in the lemma that n  ≥  16.

Before proving Lemma [\ref=LEMirreducible], we wish to state the other lemma that concerns irreducible symmeric spaces:

Assume Mn is a 1-connected, compact, irreducible symmetric space. If [formula] for 3  <  i  <  16, then M is S2 or S3.

The only facts about 4-periodicity up to degree 16 that we will use in the proofs are the following: bi  =  bi + 4 for 0  <  i  <  12, b4  ≤  1, and b4  =  0 only if bi = 0 for all 0 < i < 16. Here and throughout the section, bi denotes the i-th Betti number of M.

We use Cartan's classification of simply connected, irreducible compact symmetric spaces. We also keep Cartan's notation. See [\cite=Helgason01] for a reference.

One possibility is that M is a simple Lie group. The rational cohomology of M is therefore that of a product of spheres [formula] for some s  ≥  1 where the ni are odd. In fact, these sphere dimensions are known and are listed in Table [\ref=TABLEspheres] on page (see [\cite=Mimura-Toda78] for a reference). Since M is simply connected, we may assume

[formula]

Since b3(M)  ≠  0, we have b4(M) = 1 by our comments above. But this cannot be since the ni are odd, so there are no simple Lie groups with 4-periodic rational cohomology up to degree 16.

We now consider the irreducible spaces which are not Lie groups. We have that M  =  G / H for some compact Lie groups G and H where G is simple. The possible pairs (G,H) fall into one of seven classical families or are one of 12 exceptional examples. We calculate the first 15 Betti numbers in each case, then compare the results to the requirement that they be 4-periodic as described above. We summarize the results in Tables [\ref=TABLEclassical] and [\ref=TABLEexceptional].

To explain our calculations, we first consider M  =  G / H with [formula]. Let [formula] and [formula] denote the rational homotopy types of G and H, respectively. Then one has the following formula for the Poincaré polynomial of M (see [\cite=Borel53]):

[formula]

For each simple Lie group G, the dimensions of the spheres are listed in Table [\ref=TABLEspheres]. When [formula], we compute the Poincaré polynomial of M and list the relevant terms in Tables [\ref=TABLEclassical] and [\ref=TABLEexceptional].

In the case where [formula], we simply cite a source where the cohomology has been calculated. The tables give the pair (G,H) realizing the space, the first few terms of the Poincaré polynomial if [formula], and the the relevant Betti number inequalities that show M is not rationally 4-periodic up to degree 16.

In Table [\ref=TABLEclassical], we exclude spaces with dimension less than 16. We also exclude the rank one Grassmannians and the rank two and rank three real Grassmannians, as these are the spaces that appear in the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM].

We are given a 1-connected, compact, irreducible symmetric space M with Betti numbers that satisfy bi  =  0 for 3 < i < 16.

First, if dim M  ≤  3, then M is S2 or S3 since M is simply connected. Second, if dim M  >  3, then the fact that bdim M  =  1 implies that dim M  ≥  16. It is apparent from Table [\ref=TABLEspheres] that M is not a simple Lie group. On the other hand, it is apparent that M cannot appear in Table [\ref=TABLEclassical] or Table [\ref=TABLEexceptional]. Finally, M cannot be a rank one symmetric space or a rank p Grassmannian SO(p + q) / SO(p)  ×  SO(q) with p∈{2,3} since each of these spaces has fourth Betti number equal to one.

With the first step complete, we prove the following lemma about general products M = M'  ×  M'' whose rational cohomology ring is 4-periodic up to degree c. For simplicity we denote the Betti numbers of M, M', and M'' by bi, bi', and bi'', respectively.

Suppose b1  =  0 and that [formula] is 4-periodic up to degree c with c  ≥  9. Suppose that M = M'  ×  M'' with b4'  ≥  b4''. Then either M is rationally (c - 1)-connected or b4' = 1 and the following hold:

[formula] is 4-periodic up to degree c,

bi'' = 0 for 3  <  i  <  c, and

if b2' > 0 or b3'  >  0, then b2'' = b3'' = 0.

Let [formula] be an element inducing periodicity. If x = 0, then c  ≥  8 implies M is rationally (c - 1)-connected. Assume therefore that b4(M) = 1 (i.e., that x  ≠  0).

We first claim that b4'  =  1. Suppose instead that 0 = b4'  =  b4''. The Künneth theorem implies 1 = b4  =  b2'b2'', and hence b2' = b2'' = 1. Using periodicity and the Künneth theorem again, we have

[formula]

and hence that all four terms on the right-hand side are zero. Similarly, we have

[formula]

Finally, we obtain

[formula]

a contradiction. Assume therefore that b4'  =  1 and hence that b4''  =  b2'b2'' = 0.

Let p:M  →  M' be the projection map. It follows from b4'  =  b4  =  1 and the Künneth theorem that

[formula]

is an isomorphism. Choose [formula] with p*(x̄)  =  x. We claim that x̄ induces periodicity in H*(M') up to degree c.

First, b4' = 1 implies that multiplication by x̄ induces a surjection H0(M')  →  H4(M'). Second, consider the commutative diagram

[formula]

where the vertical arrows from left to right are given by multiplication by x̄, [formula], and x, respectively. Because mutliplication by x is injective for 0  <  i  ≤  c - 4, it follows that multiplication by x̄ is injective in these degrees as well. It therefore suffices to check that multiplication by x̄ is surjective for 0 < i < c - 4. We accomplish this by a dimension counting argument. Specifically, we claim bi'  =  bi + 4' for 0 < i < c - 4. Indeed, for all 0  ≤  i < c - 4, we have from periodicity, the Künneth theorem, and injectivity of multiplication by x̄ the following estimate:

[formula]

Equality must hold everywhere, proving bi' = bi + 4' and bi + 4'' = 0 for all 0  ≤  i < c - 4. This completes the proof of the first part, as well as the second part, of the lemma.

Finally, suppose that b2' > 0 or b3' > 0. Then

[formula]

implies b2'' = 0, and

[formula]

implies b3''  =  0.

Finally, we come to the proof of Theorem [\ref=symspsTHM]. In fact, we prove the following stronger theorem:

Suppose Mn has the rational cohomology ring of a simply connected, compact symmetric space N. Let c  ≥  16, and assume M has a metric with positive sectional curvature and symmetry rank at least [formula]. Then there exists a (possibly trivial) product S of spheres, each of dimension at least c, such that one of the following holds:

N = S,

N  =  S  ×  R with [formula], or

N  =  S  ×  R  ×  Q with [formula] and Q∈{ * ,S2,S3}.

Consider the special case where N is a product of spheres, Sk  ×  Sn - k. This theorem implies that each sphere has dimension at least c, which is at least 16, so N cannot be Sk  ×  Sn - k with 1 < k < 16, as claimed in the introduction.

Observe that the Lie group E8 has the rational cohomology of a product of spheres in dimensions [formula]. It follows that the rational cohomology of [formula] is 4-periodic up to degree 15, so we must take c  ≥  16 in the statement of this theorem.

Let Nn be as in the theorem. Assuming without loss of generality that n > 0, Lemma [\ref=Grove-Searle] implies n  ≥  16.

By the corollary to Theorem [\ref=thmP-intro], we conclude that N is rationally 4-periodic up to degree c. Write [formula] where the Ni are irreducible symmetric spaces and b4(N1)  ≥  b4(Ni) for all i. By Lemma [\ref=LEMPeriodicProductManifolds], b4(N1) = 0 implies N is rationally (c - 1)-connected and hence is a product of spheres since c  ≥  16. Assume therefore that b4(N1) = b4(N) = 1.

By the same lemma, N1 is 4-periodic up to degree c. Observe that periodicity implies n  ≥  16 since x4  ≠  0 where [formula] is an element inducing periodicity up to degree 16. By Lemma [\ref=LEMirreducible], we have that N1 is [formula], SO(2 + q) / SO(2)  ×  SO(q), [formula], or SO(3 + q) / SO(3)  ×  SO(q). We also have that Ni for i > 1 has bj(Ni) = 0 for all 3  <  j  <  c. If N is [formula] or SO(2 + q) / SO(2)  ×  SO(q), then b2(N1)  +  b3(N1)  >  0, which by Lemmas [\ref=LEMPeriodicProductManifolds] and [\ref=LEMirreducible2] implies Ni is a sphere for all i > 1. This completes the proof in this case. Suppose therefore that N1 is [formula] or SO(3 + q) / SO(3)  ×  SO(q). If b2(Ni) + b3(Ni) = 0 for all i > 0, then once again we have that each Ni with i > 1 is a sphere. Suppose therefore that some Ni, say with i = 2, has b2(N2)  +  b3(N2)  >  0. Taking M'  =  N1  ×  N2 and [formula] in the lemma implies Ni is a sphere for all i > 2. Finally, N2 is an irreducible symmetric space with b2(N2)  +  b3(N2)  >  0 and bi(N2) = 0 for all 3  <  i  <  16. Lemma [\ref=LEMirreducible2] implies that N2 is a 2-sphere or a 3-sphere, completing the proof.
