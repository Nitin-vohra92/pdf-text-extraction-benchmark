The Lightest Massive Invisible Particles at the LHC

Introduction

One of the main goals of high-energy accelerator experiments like the LHC is the discovery, via direct production and subsequent detection of the associated decay products, of degrees of freedom beyond those present in the standard model. An advantage of direct production is that the various properties of the new particles, including their masses, can be measured, often with very good precision. Different methods exist for measuring the masses of the particles involved in different production and decay topologies [\cite=Gripaios:2011na] [\cite=Barr:2010zj], but a unique problem arises when one or more of the final-state particles are "invisible," i.e., they do not interact directly with the detector. At a hadron collider, the existence of invisible particles can be inferred only via momentum conservation in the plane transverse to the beamline; only the vector sum of the transverse momenta associated with invisible particles can be reconstructed. If two missing particles in a single event each originate from identical decay chains, e.g., a t-like topology, the MT2 variable [\cite=Lester:1999tx] is a useful tool for extracting the masses of the parent, intermediate, and invisible particles in the decay chain. Remarkably, this includes the mass of the particles associated with the missing energy in the event [\cite=Barr:2007hy] [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh] [\cite=Burns:2008va]. A t-like topology is one of the best-suited topologies for measuring the mass of the invisible particles.

Two popular MT2-based methods for extracting the masses of the particles in a t-like decay topology are reconstructing the MT2 kink [\cite=Barr:2007hy] [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh] and the MT2 subsystems method [\cite=Burns:2008va]. The MT2 kink method involves measuring MT2 endpoints, which we call [formula], for different values of an ansatz for the invisible particles' mass [\cite=Barr:2007hy] [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh]. Analytical expressions can be fit to the distribution of [formula] as a function of the input ansatz, and the masses of the particles in the decay chain can be determined simultaneously from this fit. A kink exists in the [formula] distribution at the mass of the invisible particles, but as the mass of the invisible particles becomes light, it may be difficult to determine that the location of the kink is non-zero, given experimental uncertainties. Another MT2-based method involves studying subsystems of the decay chain and measuring three kinematic endpoints [\cite=Burns:2008va]. With the analytical expressions for the endpoints of each subsystem, one can simultaneously solve for the masses of the particles in the decay chain. If the mass of the invisible particle is light, the uncertainty for solving for its mass can become large. Because of the experimental uncertainties associated with these MT2 methods, there is a minimum mass of the invisible particle above which it can distinguished from a massless particle at 95% C.L.

If a large missing-energy signal is discovered at the LHC, it is possible that this signal could be due not to dark matter, but to anomalous production of neutrinos [\cite=Chang:2009dh]. Measuring the mass of the invisible particles is the only model-independent way to distinguish massive invisible particles, e.g. dark matter, from those that are effective massless, e.g., neutrinos. We employ the MT2 kink and the MT2 subsystems methods to determine how heavy the invisible particles must be in order to be distinguishable from a massless hypothesis, which, in essence, is an estimation of the lower bound on detectable dark matter at a hadron collider.

Much of the literature to date uses SUSY models when addressing mass determination with MT2 methods, taking the LSP to be [formula]) [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh] [\cite=Nojiri:2008hy] [\cite=Hamaguchi:2008hy] [\cite=Alwall:2009zu] [\cite=Konar:2009qr] [\cite=Cho:2009wh] [\cite=Agashe:2010tu] [\cite=Ajaib:2010ne] [\cite=Chen:2010ek] [\cite=Choi:2010dk] [\cite=Cohen:2010wv] [\cite=Park:2011uz]. The motivations for considering dark matter to have these masses in the context of the MSSM and in light of experimental constraints are described in Ref. [\cite=Belanger:2012jn] and the references found therein. Data from the CoGeNT [\cite=Aalseth:2010vx], DAMA/LIBRA [\cite=Bernabei:2008yi] [\cite=Bernabei:2010mq], and CRESST [\cite=Angloher:2011uu] experiments, on the other hand, hint at the existence of light dark matter (mass of order a few to 10 GeV). Only a few examples exist in the literature which study light dark matter properties, including masses, at hadron colliders, in particular, Ref. [\cite=Belanger:2011ny]. In that analysis, the authors consider a light sneutrino with mass [formula] and demonstrate that when using MT2-based methods, the uncertainty associated with the measured mass of the sneutrino can be relatively large. They consider various experimental effects, appropriate for their analysis, e.g., backgrounds, combinatorial ambiguity, initial-state radiation, etc. Since all of these effects make it more difficult to locate the MT2 endpoint, here we simply quote our results as a function of uncertainty with measuring it. We also take care to estimate the correlations between MT2 endpoints as a function of the input ansatz mass, an effect not considered in Ref. [\cite=Belanger:2011ny]. We believe that by ignoring these correlations one may significantly underestimate the uncertainties associated with measuring the mass of the invisible particles.

The outline of our analysis is as follows: in Section [\ref=mt2variable], we define and review the MT2 variable and express the previously-derived [\cite=Barr:2007hy] [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh] expressions for its endpoints. In Sections [\ref=kinkmethod] and [\ref=subsmethod], we create pseudo-data and use the MT2 kink and subsystems methods, respectively, to determine the mass that the invisible particle must have in order to distinguish it from a massless particle at 95% C.L. We do this for various masses of the parent and intermediate particles, and different uncertainties associated with the determination of the MT2 endpoints. We conclude and discuss our results in Section [\ref=conclusion].

The MT2 Variable

Consider a general decay chain where a single massive particle, A, with mass mA, decays to N massless, visible final-state particles and one potentially massive, invisible particle with physical mass m. The individual three-momenta of the visible particles, [formula], are measured, and their four-momenta, pμi, are inferred with the massless approximation. The invariant mass of the visible system, [formula], is defined as

[formula]

At a hadron collider, the sum of the transverse momentum of all final-state particles in the event is zero (to a good approximation), and the transverse momentum of the invisible particle, [formula], can be inferred. We adopt an ansatz for the mass of the invisible particle, [formula], and define the transverse mass variable MT, the square of which is defined as

[formula]

A distribution of MT values displays a "kinematic endpoint" or "edge" at the value of mA when   =  m.

Consider now an event where a pair of A's is created. Each parent particle and their daughters belong to a "branch" or "decay chain", where we add the label "(1)" and "(2)" to distinguish between the respective decay chains. The two parent particles, A(1) and A(2), eventually decay to N(1) and N(2) visible effectively-massless particles and a potentially-massive invisible particle with mass m. The measured missing transverse momentum, [formula], is the vector sum of the transverse momenta of the two invisible particles. Because there are two invisible particles in the final state, the MT variable does not provide information concerning the masses of the particles in the decay chain. However, a generalized MT variable, called MT2, can be introduced [\cite=Lester:1999tx], and because we do not know how the transverse momentum is shared between the invisible particles, the square of MT2 is defined as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are free parameters over which the function is minimized, subject to the constraint [formula]. The distribution of MT2 exhibits an endpoint, [formula], at mA when   =  m. If   ≠  m, the MT2 endpoint still exists, but its location does not equal mA. In general, the change in the value of [formula] as a function of [formula] contains the information of the masses of the particles in the decay chains. A remarkable quality of the MT2 variable is, for some topologies, the analytical form that describes [formula] when   >  m is different from that when   <  m. While these functions are continuous for all [formula], their first derivatives are not, and a "kink" exists in the distribution of [formula] at   =  m [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh]. By analyzing the shape of the [formula] distribution as a function of [formula], one can determine, in principle, the masses of the particles in the decay chains.

For the rest of our discussions, we will assume a t-like topology, as shown in Fig. [\ref=ttbardecay]: A(i)  →  B(i)D(i), followed by B(i)  →  C(i)E(i), where i = 1,2 and C is considered to be the potentially-massive invisible particle. We make no further assumptions regarding what particle types are D or E, only that they are effectively-massless and their three-momenta can be reconstructed. Particles A, B, and C have mass mA, mB and mC, respectively, and we assign the ansatz C for the mass of the invisible particles. The analytical expressions for [formula] for the t-like topology are, in the limit of no initial-state radiation (ISR) [\cite=Cho:2007dh] [\cite=Barr:2007hy],

[formula]

By fitting the distribution of [formula] as a function of C with the expression for [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=mt2max]), one can simultaneously solve for mA, mB, and mC.

In the absence of experimental effects, the MT2 endpoint is a sharp and easily distinguishable feature. However, given a realistic collider environment, finding the kinematic endpoint of the MT2 distribution can be difficult [\cite=Curtin:2011ng]. The endpoint feature can be obfuscated by decay widths, finite detector resolutions, and lack of statistics around the kinematic endpoint. Additionally, it is often experimentally difficult to distinguish different types of final-state jets, e.g., if a reconstructed jet is due to a gluon or quark, so if there are jets in the final state of the pair-produced decay chain, the MT2 endpoints can be contaminated with initial-state radiation jets [\cite=Krohn:2011zp] [\cite=Nojiri:2010mk]. There can also exist combinatorial ambiguities associated with which jet is to be paired with which decay chain [\cite=Baringer:2011nh] [\cite=Choi:2011ys] [\cite=Rajaraman:2010hy]. For the purposes of our study, we encapsulate these experimental effects by quoting our results as a function of the uncertainty associated with determining the location of an MT2 endpoint, σE. In particular, we assume that σE will be the same for all values of C, mA, and mB. While it is a simplifying assumption to distill these experimental effects to a single number, our goal is to estimate the precision with which a collider experiment can measure the mass of a final-state invisible particle, instead of performing a detailed study of specific experimental effects. We will present our results for σE = 1 and 5 GeV (assuming it is a convolution of statistical and systematic uncertainties), which we consider to be optimistic estimates for the uncertainties associated with the capabilities of the LHC [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013boa]. In particular, the analysis in Ref. [\cite=Chatrchyan:2013boa], which uses a clean sample of SM t events, measures the location of the three MT2 subsystems endpoints with a precision of [formula] [\cite=eggert].

The MT2 Kink Method and Light Dark Matter

If the mass of the invisible particle is small, i.e., small relative to the MT2 endpoint uncertainty, σE, it may be difficult to distinguish a massive invisible particle from one that is massless. To estimate how heavy the dark matter must be in order to be distinguished from anomalous neutrino production, we must study the uncertainties associated with measuring the mass of the invisible particle using the MT2 kink method. To do this, one could consider producing Monte Carlo (MC) events of a t-like topology with a detector simulation and using a procedure to measure the [formula] distribution as a function of C. However, because of the significant amount of time it would take to create and analyze such MC samples, we choose to simulate simplified pseudo-data of the [formula] distribution. A full description of how we created simplified pseudo-data can be found in Appendix [\ref=apa]. We take note that the individual values of [formula] are highly correlated between values of C that are close together. This is easily understood since the events that populate the MT2 kinematic endpoint for a given C are mostly the same, regardless of the choice of C. For simplicity, we assume that this correlation does not depend on the physical masses of the decay topology, and we choose to sample [formula] in 0.25 GeV steps of C. We find that a smaller step size of C yields endpoints that are too correlated for adjacent values of C, and a larger step size would hinder the ability to resolve the position of the kink when it has a value close to zero.

When simulating the simplified pseudo-data, we take care to estimate the positive correlations between MT2 endpoint measurements. Ignoring to do so would imply that the uncertainty associated with the location of the MT2 kink depends on the choice of step size of C, which is arbitrary, and the values of [formula] can be significantly underestimated. For example, if we repeat our analysis ignoring the correlations between the MT2 endpoints for values of C that are 0.25 GeV apart, then the values for [formula] is underestimated by almost a factor of two. We note that the presence of these correlations is independent from the treatment of the uncertainties associated with measuring the location of the MT2 endpoint.

The full summary of our estimation of the correlation between MT2(C) endpoints can be found in Appendix [\ref=apa]. We generate fifty thousand pseudo-data [formula] distributions for different values of mC, fitting them with the analytical functions for [formula] in Eq. ([\ref=mt2max]), for which the physical masses of the decay topology are the fitting parameters. For each fitted distribution of [formula], we histogram the fifty thousand best fit values of mC (which explicitly marginalizes over the uncertainties associated with the mA and mB fitting parameters), and from the width of this histogram, we estimate the 95% C.L. associated with the value of mC.

To draw similarities from a SM production of t events, i.e., for mA  =  172 GeV, mB  =  80.4 GeV (while still letting mC float), the uncertainties of the measurement of mC given σEi  =  1 GeV and σEi  =  5 GeV are shown in Fig. [\ref=kink1]. From these figures, one can determine what the mass of mC must be in order to distinguish it from mC = 0 at 95% C.L. If we call this value [formula], then [formula] GeV if σE  =  1 GeV, and [formula] GeV if σE  =  5 GeV. We also estimate [formula] when mA  =  500 GeV and mB = 100 GeV, as shown in Fig. [\ref=kink2], and when mA  =  500 GeV and mB = 480 GeV, as shown in Fig. [\ref=kink3]. These results for the value of [formula], given the values of mA, mB, and σE, can be understood as a lower bound on a measured non-zero mass of dark matter.

The MT2 Subsystems Method and Light Dark Matter

In order to address some of the combinatorial difficulties associated with the MT2 kink method, the authors of Ref. [\cite=Burns:2008va] developed what is known as the MT2 subsystems method. To simultaneously measure mA, mB, and mC, the MT2 subsystems method relies on the measurement of three independent endpoints: E210 ([formula] of the C1E1C2E2 system), E221 ([formula] of the D1E1D2E2 system), and Eim (endpoint of the invariant mass of the visible D1E1 or D2E2 systems). These endpoints can be expressed as functions of the physical masses in the decay chain. Following the naming convention in Ref. [\cite=Burns:2008va],

[formula]

Given a measurement of the endpoints Ei, where i = 221, 210, or im, each with an associated uncertainty, σEi, one can, in principle, invert Eqs. ([\ref=E221])-([\ref=Eim]) to solve for mA, mB, and mC as a function of the three Ei's. However, because the measured endpoints may not have exactly the expected values, the system of equations may not be invertible without introducing large uncertainties. For this reason, we study the MT2 subsystems method, as we did the MT2 kink method, in order to estimate how massive must the dark matter be in order to be distinguished from anomalous neutrino production.

Instead of inverting Eqs. ([\ref=E221])-([\ref=Eim]), we choose to perform a χ2 fit using the measured values of Ei, σEi, and the expected values of the endpoints as a function of the physical masses as expressed in Eqs. ([\ref=E221])-([\ref=Eim]). This χ2 function can be minimized with respect to mA, m2B, and m2C, yielding the best estimates A, 2B, and 2C for every set of Ei and σEi. In the fit, we allow m2B and m2C to float negative but constrain mA to be positive. We assume that the uncertainties associated with the three Ei's are uncorrelated.

To estimate the uncertainties associated with our ability to measure mC, we generate fifty thousand pseudo-experiments, each with a set of three endpoint measurements, Ei, and each endpoint with the same uncertainty, σEi, for simplicity. A χ2 function is minimized for each pseudo-experiment, negative values of 2C are set to zero (since they are unphysical), and the square root of the positive values of C are histogramed. We find that the center of this distribution is centered about the physical mass mC and integrate about this center to find the 95% C.L. associated with the uncertainty of mC.

In order to compare these results with those found using the MT2 kink method, we produce similar plots as in Figs. [\ref=kink1]-[\ref=kink3], using the MT2 subsystems method. These are depicted in Figs. [\ref=subsystems1]-[\ref=subsystems3]. We find very similar results for the value of [formula] between the MT2 subsystems and kink methods. This makes us confident that the procedure described in Appendix [\ref=apa] is sufficient to simulate the correlations between different MT2 endpoints as a function of C.

We estimate [formula] as a function of both mA and mB, as shown in Fig. [\ref=subsystems2D1], using the MT2 subsystems method. We find when the masses of the parent and intermediate particles are close, the value of [formula] is higher as compared to when mA and mB have a large mass difference. We choose not to compute the two dimensional plots of [formula] using the MT2 kink method, as in Fig. [\ref=subsystems2D1], since creating the pseudo-data to make the [formula] distributions is computationally expensive, and would require a sizable amount of running time. Again, these results for the value of [formula], given the values of mA, mB, and σE, can be understood as a lower bound on a measured non-zero mass of dark matter.

To study how the value of [formula] changes as one increases σE past 5 GeV, we repeat the MT2 subsystems analysis for values of σE = 10, 15, and 20 GeV. We find that the value of [formula] increases roughly quadratically with an increase in σE, and we observe no effects of saturation. For example, when mA  =  172 GeV, mB  =  80 GeV, and σE = 1, 5, 10, and 15 GeV, the values of [formula] are roughly 8, 17, 70, 150 GeV, respectively.

Conclusion

The observation of new physics events with large missing transverse energy at the LHC would potentially serve as evidence for the production of dark matter. A crucial step toward verifying such evidence is the measurement of the masses of the would-be dark matter particles, i.e., the invisible particles. If, say, an excess of invisible particles is discovered and their masses are found to be consistent with zero, one can either conclude that there are new light massive invisible particles, their masses obfuscated by experimental resolution, or that there is new physics in the neutrino sector [\cite=Chang:2009dh]. As hinted by the CoGeNT [\cite=Aalseth:2010vx], DAMA/LIBRA [\cite=Bernabei:2008yi] [\cite=Bernabei:2010mq], and CRESST [\cite=Angloher:2011uu] experiments, dark matter may have a mass of [formula]. Coincidently, assuming that dark matter is produced at hadron colliders in a t-like event, i.e., the "best-case" decay topology and considering optimistic experimental uncertainties, we find that dark matter must have a mass greater than [formula] such that it can be distinguished from neutrinos at 95% C.L. using MT2-based methods. In general, the uncertainty associated with measuring the mass the invisible particles increases (decreases) as the mass decreases (increases). Our results suggest that, at the LHC, it may prove very challenging to distinguish light dark matter from neutrinos through mass measurements alone if the dark matter weighs around 10 GeV or less.

As seen in Fig. [\ref=subsystems2D1], the uncertainty associated with the measurement of the invisible particles' mass increases as the mass mB of the intermediate particles is close to the mass mA of the parent particles, and one finds the inverse effect if the intermediate particles are much lighter than the parent particles. In other words, a more precise measurement of the mass of the invisible particles can be made when the intermediate particles have a larger momentum in the center-of-mass frame of the two parent particles. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with the measurement of the invisible particles' mass also increases as the parent particles' mass increases, for fixed mB / mA. These features are due to the fact that the kink structure of the [formula] distribution becomes more pronounced when there is a large mass difference between the parent and intermediate particles. A similar scenario occurs when the intermediate particle is off-shell, such that mB  >  mA  >  mC, i.e., the kink structure becomes more pronounced [\cite=Burns:2008va]. While a more pronounced kink structure will increase the precision at which one can measure the masses of particles involved in a given decay chain, it is not generally expected that it will change the shape of the uncertainty associated with mC as a function of the physical masses.

We observe a rough quadratic relationship between between the values of σE and [formula]. Using the MT2 subsystems method, we let mA = 172 GeV, mB = 80 GeV, and σE = 1, 5, 10, and 15 GeV, and find the associated values of [formula] to be roughly 8, 17, 70 and 150 GeV, respectively. Beyond σE  =  15 GeV, the uncertainty on the mass of the invisible particle becomes very large.

The individual events that populate the region about an MT2 endpoint for a given value of the ansatz mass are, to a good approximation, the same events that populate the endpoint for another nearby value of the ansatz mass. As shown in Fig. [\ref=mt2endpoints] (see Appendix [\ref=apa]), the values of [formula] are not randomly distributed about the theoretical expectation, and while there are systematic uncertainties associated with MT2 endpoint-finding procedure, there can be significant correlations between the measured values [formula] for adjacent values of C. For this reason, one cannot simply fit the measured value of [formula] using Eq. ([\ref=mt2max]) while treating the individual values of [formula] as independent measurements. In our analysis, we take this correlation into account when fitting with Eq. ([\ref=mt2max]) and marginalize over the other fitting parameters in order to correctly quote the uncertainty on the mass of the invisible particles. The majority of analyses in the literature ignore the correlation between values of [formula] for adjacent values of C, e.g., Refs. [\cite=Cho:2007qv] [\cite=Cho:2007dh] [\cite=Choi:2010dk] [\cite=Belanger:2011ny] [\cite=Nojiri:2008hy]. If these correlations are not taken into account when using the MT2 kink method, the uncertainties associated with the measured masses can be underestimated.

Other MT2-based methods and topologies could have been considered in our analysis. All methods capable of extracting the mass of the invisible particles, however, take advantage of singularities in the kinematic phase space [\cite=Kim:2009si] [\cite=Cheng:2008hk]. Though some attention has been paid to other methods that can, in principle, provide more precise mass measurements [\cite=Matchev:2009fh] [\cite=Konar:2009wn], we speculate that the limitations of the MT2 kink and subsystems methods, discussed here in some detail, will be similar to the limitations of other methods as far as determining the mass of light invisible particles is concerned. Because our results were so similar for the MT2 kink and subsystems methods, it is possible that these trends are independent from the method used to extract the mass of the invisible particles.

Correlations between MT2 endpoints

To understand the correlation between endpoint measurements, we generate a madgraph5 [\cite=Alwall:2011uj] sample of one hundred thousand SM pp  →  t events at [formula] TeV, where the mass of the top quark is 172 GeV (corresponding to mA), and the mass of the W is 80.4 GeV (corresponding to mB). At the generator level, we fit the endpoint of a given MT2 distribution with the following four-parameter probability density function:

[formula]

where x is a dummy variable for the x-axis of an MT2 distribution, A is a normalization constant, x0 is taken to be the location of [formula], and kL and kR are the exponential slopes on the left and right sides of the kink, respectively. We assume no combinatorial background associated with which jet is associated with which decay branch. The values of [formula] and [formula] are chosen a priori to be certain values about the expected value of [formula]. While picking values of [formula] and [formula] based off a theoretical expectation introduces a bias, we are only interested in extracting information concerning a rough estimation of how correlated adjacent endpoint measurements are as a function of C. For each MT2(C) distribution, we perform an unbinned log-likelihood fit, where the log-likelihood function is defined using events with a value of MT2 between [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

The extremization of ln L is performed with minuit [\cite=James:1975dr], and the results of the fits are shown in Fig. [\ref=mt2endpoints]. The uncertainty associated with x0 is found by marginalizing over the uncertainties for A, mL, and mR and varying the log-likelihood about the minimum function by a value of 0.5 as a function of x0.

While this particular madgraph5 sample vastly oversimplifies the type of distributions one would have to work with at a collider experiment, we only wish to extract information concerning the correlation between adjacent endpoints. To estimate the correlation between MT2 endpoints and to create pseudo-data, we need to simulate a distribution that properly mimics the one in Fig. [\ref=mt2endpoints] while avoiding having to make thousands of madgraph5 samples. To create pseudo-data that contain the correlations we see in Fig. [\ref=mt2endpoints], we need to quantify how much each endpoint measurement is correlated with others.

We employ a simplified model of nearest-neighbor correlations. In this method, a single endpoint has its own uncertainty, σi, and is positively correlated with the endpoint immediately to the left (except for the left-most endpoint, which is taken to have no correlations with any other endpoint). For simplicity, we consider that all measurements of [formula] have the same uncertainty, σE. We create a covariance matrix, which only includes nearest-neighbor correlations:

[formula]

Here, NNC is the nearest-neighbor correlation factor. With this error matrix, one can iteratively generate pseudo-data that resemble a type of distribution we find with a madgraph5 sample and a simple fitting procedure. We begin with the first point, n0, at C = 0 GeV, allowing it to be Gaussian-distributed about the theoretical expectation, μ0, with an error of σE. The next point, n1, is Gaussian-distributed about the expectation μ1 with uncertainty σE but also is positively correlated to the the previous point. These endpoints are random variables sampled from the following probability density function (up to an overall normalization factor):

[formula]

Examples for the simplified pseudo-data for [formula] are shown in Fig. [\ref=NNC].

While comparing the madgraph5 and simplified pseudo-data plots by eye is suitable for our purposes, we wish to compare them more quantitatively. We can create a test statistic that estimates how much a given endpoint, ni, correlates with the endpoint immediately to its left, ni - 1:

[formula]

where μi and μi - 1 are the theoretical expectations (given the physical masses of the system) for the [formula] distribution for bin i and the bin immediately to the left, i - 1. If each endpoint is statistically uncorrelated with the one immediately to the left, the distribution for R should be symmetric about zero. Fig. [\ref=mt2corr] shows a histogram of the values of R for the madgraph5 sample and the probability density functions for pseudo-data for different values of NNC (these lines are determined by averaging over many generated pseudo-data). Guided by these distributions, we choose a value of NNC = 0.5 to perform the study discuss in Sec. [\ref=kinkmethod]. We choose this value because we interpret that the random jumps in Fig. [\ref=mt2endpoints] for 0 < C < 10 GeV are innocuous qualities of our endpoint fitting procedure, and subsequently the histogramed values of - 2  <  R  <  0 in Fig. [\ref=mt2corr] for the madgraph5 sample are not sampled from the true probability density function for R. Values larger than NNC = 0.5 where not studied because they lead to pseudo-data that deviated too much from the theoretical expectation, which is a feature not found in Fig. [\ref=mt2endpoints]. Finally, we find that the correlation between adjacent values of C is not particularly sensitive to the physical masses of the particles in the decay chain, including mC.
