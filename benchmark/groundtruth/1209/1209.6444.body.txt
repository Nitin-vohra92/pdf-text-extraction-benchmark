Independent and free sets in universal algebras

Introduction

It is well-known that each maximal linearly independent subset of a linear space X generates X. A natural notion of independence can be also defined for other algebraic structures, in particular, for universal algebras. Unfortunately, even for relative simple universal algebras (like groups) the notion of independence does not work as good as for linear spaces. For example, any infinite linear space V over the two-element field [formula] can be embedded into a non-commutative group G of cardinality |G| = 2|V| so that each maximal linearly independent subset B  ⊂  V remains maximal independent in G and hence does not generate the whole group G. This fact (proved in Proposition [\ref=p1.3]) shows that the problem of constructing large independent sets in general algebraic setting is not trivial.

A general theory of algebraic independence was created by Marczewski [\cite=M1]-[\cite=M3] and further developed by many mathematicians (see [\cite=Glazek] and references therein). A subset B of an abstract algebra (A,A) is called M-independent provided each function from B in A can be extended to a homomorphism defined on the algebra generated by B. This notion is a generalization of the linear and algebraic independence of numbers, linear independence of vectors, independence of sets and elements of Boolean algebras and many others. In our paper, Marczewski's independent sets will be called "free". The notion of a "hull" (or "closure") was introduced by Birkhoff [\cite=B] and also considered by Marczewski (e.g. in [\cite=M2]). Other concepts of independence considered in our paper can be also found in [\cite=M2] and [\cite=Glazek]. For the reader's convenience we recall some proofs and considerations in the modern notation.

Our main result is Theorem [\ref=main] saying that for each universal algebra [formula] of cardinality |A|  ≥  2 and each infinite set X of cardinality |X|  ≥  |A|, the X-power [formula] of the algebra [formula] contains a free set F  ⊂  AX of cardinality |F| = 2|X|. This generalizes a classical Fichtenholtz-Katorovitch-Hausdorff result on the existence of an independent family F  ⊂  P(X) of cardinality |F| = 2|X| in the power-set P(X) of X. The other famous generalization of Fichtenholtz-Katorovitch-Hausdorff theorem is the Balcar-Fran ek theorem on the number of independent elements in complete Boolean algebras [\cite=BF].

Hull operators and (strongly) independent sets

By a hull operator on a set X we understand a function C:P(X)  →  P(X) defined on a family of all subsets of X, which is monotone in the sense that for any subsets A  ⊆  B  ⊆  X we get A  ⊆  C(A)  ⊆  C(B)  ⊆  X.

Let C:P(X)  →  P(X) be a hull operator on a set X. A subset B  ⊂  X is called

C-independent if [formula] for each b∈B;

strongly C-independent if [formula] and [formula] for any subsets B1,B2  ⊂  B.

In [\cite=Schmidt] strongly C-independent sets were called C3-independent.

Let X be a set and C be a hull operator on X. Each strongly C-independent set B  ⊂  X is C-independent.

Assuming that a strongly C-independent set B is not C-independent, we can find a point b∈B such that [formula]. Then [formula], which is not possible as [formula].

Proposition [\ref=p1.1] can be reversed for hull operators of matroid type. We say that a hull operator C:P(X)  →  P(X)

is a closure operator if C(C(A)) = C(A) for each subset A  ⊂  X;

has finite supports if for each subset A  ⊂  X and a point x∈C(A) there is a finite subset F  ⊂  A with x∈C(F);

has the MacLane-Steinitz exchange property if for any subset A  ⊂  X and points [formula] the inclusion [formula] is equivalent to [formula];

is of matroid type if C is a closure operator with finite supports and the Maclane-Steinitz exchange property.

It is well-known (and easy to see) that the operator of taking the linear hull in a linear space is of matroid type. The following proposition is well-known in the theory of independence (see [\cite=Matroids], [\cite=Schmidt], and [\cite=Glazek]). We present a short proof for the convenience of the reader.

Let C:P(X)  →  P(X) be a hull operator of matroid type on a set X.

A subset B  ⊂  X is C-independent if and only if it is strongly C-independent.

Each C-independent subset lies in a maximal C-independent subset of X.

Each maximal C-independent subset B  ⊂  X has hull C(B) = X.

1. Proposition [\ref=p1.1] implies that each strongly C-independent subset of X is C-independent. Now assume that a set B is C-independent. Then for each b∈B we get [formula] and hence [formula]. To show that B is strongly C-independent, it remains to check that [formula] for any subsets B1,B2  ⊂  B. This inclusion is trivial if B1  ⊂  B2 or B2  ⊂  B1. So, we assume that [formula] and [formula]. Given any point [formula], we should prove that [formula]. Assume conversely that [formula]. Since the closure operator C has finite supports, there are minimal finite subsets F1  ⊂  B1 and F2  ⊂  B2 such that [formula]. It follows from [formula] that [formula] and hence c∉F1 or c∉F2. Without loss of generality, c∉F1. It follows from [formula], that [formula] and [formula]. Choose any point [formula] and let [formula]. The C-independence of the set B implies [formula] and the minimality of the set F1 implies c∉C(A). Since [formula], the MacLane-Steinitz exchange property of C guarantees that

[formula]

which contradicts the C-independence of B.

2. The second statement can be easily proved using Zorn's Lemma and the fact that the closure operator C has finite supports.

3. Let B be a maximal C-independent subset in X. If C(B)  ≠  X, then we can choose a point [formula]. By the maximality of B the set [formula] is not C-independent. Consequently, there is a point b∈Bx such that [formula]. If b  ≠  x, then consider the set [formula] and observe that [formula]. Then the MacLane-Steinitz exchange property implies [formula], which contradicts the choice of x. So, b = x and [formula], which contradicts the choice of x.

Unfortunately many hull operators that naturally appear in algebra are not of matroid type. The simplest example is the group hull operator. It assigns to each subset A of a group G the subgroup C(A)  ⊂  G generated by A. Observe that the set {2,3} is C-independent in the group of integers [formula] but fails to be strongly C-independent in [formula]. Each maximal strongly C-independent subset B in the group of rational [formula] is a singleton and hence [formula]. The following proposition yields an example of a (non-commutative) group G of cardinality continuum containing a maximal C-independent subset which is countable and hence does not generate the whole group.

Each infinite linear space V over the two-element field [formula] embeds into a group G of cardinality |G| = 2|V| such that for the operator of group hull C:P(G)  →  P(G) each maximal C-independent subset of V remains maximal C-independent in G.

Since the field [formula] is finite, the linear space V has a Hamel basis of cardinality |V|. Since each permutation of points of the Hamel basis induces a linear automorphism of the linear space V, the linear automorphism group GL(V) of V has cardinality |GL(V)| = 2|V|.

Let [formula] be the semidirect product of the groups (V, + ) and GL(V). Elements of the group G are ordered pairs (v,f)∈V  ×  GL(V) and for two pairs [formula] their product is defined by the formula

[formula]

The inverse element to a pair (v,f)∈G is the pair (  -  f- 1(v),f- 1).

Identify the group V with the normal subgroup [formula] of G. Here by [formula] we denote the identity automorphism of V.

Let M  ⊂  V be a maximal C-independent subset of the additive group V. Since for each subset B of V the group hull C(B) of B coincides with its linear hull, the operator of group (=linear) hull in V is of matroid type. We need to check that M remains maximal C-independent in the group G. Given any element [formula] we need to show that the union [formula] is not C-independent in G. If g∈V, then the set [formula] is not C-independent in G by the maximality of the C-independent set M in V.

So, we assume that g∉V. In this case g = (u,f)∈V  ×  GL(V) for some non-identity automorphism f of V. Observe that g- 1 = ( - f- 1(v),f- 1) and for each v∈V we get

[formula]

Being a maximal linearly independent subset of V, the set M is a Hamel basis in V. Since [formula], there is a point a∈M with f(a)  ≠  a. Since M is a Hamel basis of the linear space V, each point v∈V can be written as the sum [formula] of a unique finite subset B  ⊂  M. In particular, a = ΣA and f(a) = ΣF for some finite subsets A,F  ⊂  M. Since F  ≠  A, there is a point [formula].

If [formula], then consider the set [formula] and observe that

[formula]

which implies that [formula] is not C-independent in G.

If [formula], then consider the set [formula] and observe that

[formula]

which implies that [formula] is not C-independent in G.

So, in general, hull operators generated by algebraic structures need not be of matroid type, which makes the problem of constructing large (strongly) independent sets non-trivial. We shall be interested in hull operators induced by the structure of universal algebra (which includes as partial cases the structures of group, linear space, linear algebra, etc.) Such hull operators will be defined and studied in the next section.

Universal algebras

A universal algebra is a pair [formula] consisting of a set A and a family A of algebraic operations on A. An algebraic operation on a set A is any function α:ASα  →  A defined on a finite power ASα of A, where Sα is a finite subset of ω called the support of the operation α. An algebraic operation α:ASα  →  A is constant if α(ASα) is a singleton. In particular, each algebraic operation [formula] with empty support is constant.

Observe that any function σ:F  →  E between finite subsets of ω induces a dual function σ*:AE  →  AF, [formula], called a substitution operator. Then for any algebraic operation α:ASα  →  A with support Sα = F the composition [formula] is a well-defined algebraic operation on A with support Sβ = E.

A family A of operations on a set A is called

unital if A contains the identity operation [formula], [formula];

[formula]-regular if for each constant operation α∈A there is an operation β∈A with empty support [formula] such that [formula];

stable under substitutions (briefly, substitution-stable) if for any function σ:F  →  E between finite subsets of ω and any algebraic operation α∈A with [formula] the algebraic operation [formula] belongs to A;

stable under compositions if for any finite subset S  ⊂  ω and algebraic operations α∈A and αi∈A, i∈Sα, with supports [formula] for all i∈E the composition [formula] of the diagonal product (αi)i∈Sα:AS  →  ASα and α belongs to A;

a clone if A is unital, [formula]-regular, and stable under substitutions and compositions.

The clone of a universal algebra [formula] is the universal algebra  = (A,) endowed with the smallest clone [formula] that contains the operation family A. The clone [formula] is equal to the union [formula] of operation families An, n∈ω, defined by induction. Let [formula] and

[formula]

for n∈ω. This implies that the clone [formula] of A has cardinality [formula].

Each universal algebra [formula] possesses the canonical hull operator A(  ·  ):P(A)  →  P(A) assigning to each subset B  ⊂  A its A-hull

[formula]

The definition implies that this hull operation has finite supports.

If the operation family A is [formula]-regular, then for each constant algebraic operation α∈A, the singleton α(Anα) lies in the A-hull [formula] of the empty subset of A.

Let [formula] be a universal algebra whose operation family A is unital and stable under substitutions. Then for each subset B  ⊂  A and a point a∈A(B) there is an algebraic operation α∈A and an injective function x:Sα  →  B such that a = α(x).

Since A is unital, [formula] and we can find an operation β∈A and a function z:Sβ  →  B such that a = β(z). Let x:S  →  z(Sβ)  ⊂  B be any bijective map defined on a finite subset S  ⊂  ω. Consider the function [formula], which induces the substitution operator σ*:AS  →  ASβ. Since A is stable under substitutions, the operation [formula] belongs to A and has support Sα = S. Moreover, [formula].

A subset B  ⊂  A is called a subalgebra of a universal algebra [formula] if A(B)  ⊂  B, i.e., B coincides with its A-hull A(B). Since the intersection of subalgebras is a subalgebra, for each subset B  ⊂  A there is the smallest subalgebra of [formula] that contains B. This subalgebra is called the subalgebra generated by B and admits the following simple description:

Let [formula] be a universal algebra and [formula] be its clone. For each subset B  ⊂  A the subalgebra generated by B coincides with the [formula]-hull (B) of B.

Let 〈B〉 denote the subalgebra of [formula] generated by B. The inclusion 〈B〉  ⊂  (B) will follow as soon as we check that the [formula]-hull (B) of B is a subalgebra of the universal algebra [formula], that is (B) contains all constants and it is closed under all operations from A. We need to check that A((B))  ⊂  (B). Take any element y∈A((B)) and find an operation α∈A and a function x:Sα  →  (B) such that y = α(x). For every i∈Sα the point x(i) belongs to the [formula]-hull (B) of B and hence can be written as x(i) = αi(zi) for some algebraic operation αi∈ and some function zi:Sαi  →  B. Choose a finite subset S  ⊂  ω of cardinality [formula] and for every i∈Sα choose an injective function σi:Sαi  →  S so that [formula] for i  ≠  j. Each function σi induces the surjective substitution operators σ*i:AS  →  ASαi, [formula]. Consider a unique function z:S  →  B such that [formula] for all i∈Sα.

Since [formula] is a clone, it is closed under substitutions. Consequently, for every i∈Sα the operation [formula] belongs to [formula]. It follows that [formula]. Since the function family [formula] is closed under compositions, the operation [formula] belongs to [formula]. Since

[formula]

the point y = β(z) belongs to (B). So, A((B))  ⊂  (B) and (B) is a subalgebra of [formula], which implies 〈B〉  ⊂  (B).

To prove that (B)  ⊂  〈B〉, we use the decomposition [formula] of [formula] into the countable union of the operation families An, n∈ω, defined at the beginning of Section [\ref=s:algebras] right after the definition of clone. Since [formula], it suffices to check that An(B)  ⊂  〈B〉 for every n∈ω. This will be done by induction on n∈ω.

Since [formula], A0(B) = B  ⊂  〈B〉. Assume that for some n∈ω we have proved that An(B)  ⊂  〈B〉. The inclusion An + 1(B)  ⊂  〈B〉 will follow as soon as we check that β(x)∈〈B〉 for each operation β∈An + 1 and a function x:Sβ  →  B. If β∈An, then β(f)∈An(B)  ⊂  〈B〉.

If [formula], then by the definition of the operation family An + 1, the following three cases are possible:

1) [formula] and there is a constant operation α∈An such that [formula]. If [formula], then x∈BSα implies [formula] and hence β(x) = α(x)∈An(B)  ⊂  〈B〉.

If [formula], then we can take any function y:Sα  →  B and conclude that β(x) = α(y)∈An(B)  ⊂  〈B〉.

2) [formula] for some operation α∈An and some function σ:Sβ  →  Sα. Consider the function [formula] and observe that [formula].

3) [formula] for some operations α∈A and (αi)i∈Sα∈ASαn with Sαi = Sβ for all i∈Sα. Since x∈BSβ, the inductive assumption An(B)  ⊂  〈B〉 guarantees that for every i∈Sα the point y(i) = αi(x)∈An(B) belongs to 〈B〉. Consider the function y:Sα  →  〈B〉, y:i  ↦  y(i) = αi(x). Then [formula]. The last inclusion A(〈B〉)  ⊂  〈B〉 follows from the fact that 〈B〉 is a subalgebra of [formula].

Let [formula] be a universal algebra, X be a non-empty set, and AX be the set of all functions from X to A. For every x∈X denote by δx:AX  →  A, δx:f  ↦  f(x), the projection onto x-th coordinate.

Observe that each algebraic operation α:ASα  →  A induces an algebraic operation αX:(AX)Sα  →  AX on the set AX of all functions from X to A. The operation αX assigns to each function f:Sα  →  AX the function αX(f):X  →  A defined by [formula] for x∈X. Writing the function f is coordinates as f = (fi)i∈Sα, we get that [formula] is the function assigning to each x∈X the point [formula]

For a universal algebra [formula] its X-th power is the pair [formula] consisting of the X-th power of A and the operation family AX  =  {αX}α∈A.

Now let us consider an important example of a universal algebra [formula], called the Boolean clone. It consists of the doubleton 2 = {0,1} and the family B of all possible algebraic operations on 2. In the next section, we shall see that the powers [formula] of the Boolean clone play an important role in studying independent and free sets in powers of arbitrary universal algebras.

Independent and free sets in universal algebras

In this section we shall be interested in three independence notions in universal algebras.

A subset B  ⊂  A of a universal algebra [formula] is called

A-independent if [formula] for all b∈B;

strongly A-independent if [formula] and [formula] for any subsets B1,B2  ⊂  B;

A-free if for any function f:B  →  A there is a function :A(B)  →  A such that [formula] for any algebraic operation α∈A and any function x∈BSα  ⊂  ASα.

The notion of a (strongly) A-independent set is induced by the operator of A-hull. On the other hand, the notion of an A-free set is specific for universal algebras and has no hull counterpart.

In fact, A-free sets in universal algebras were introduced by E.Marczewski [\cite=M1], [\cite=M2], [\cite=M3]. Because of that such set are sometimes called M-independent, see [\cite=Glazek] and references therein.

The definitions imply that the notions of A-independent and A-free sets are "monotone" which respect to A:

If a subset B  ⊂  A of a universal algebra (A,A) is A-independent (A-free), then it is A'-independent (A'-free) for each operation family A'  ⊂  A.

On the other hand, the strong A-independence is not monotone with respect to A.

Take a set A of cardinality |A|  ≥  2 and consider an operation family A  =  {α,β} consisting of two constant operations α:A1  →  A, β:A0  →  A with α(A1) = β(A0). Observe that each subset of A is strongly A-independent while each subset B  ⊂  A of cardinality |B|  ≥  2 fails to be strongly A'-independent for the subfamily A' = {α}. Indeed, take two non-empty disjoint subsets B1,B2  ⊂  B and observe that [formula].

Now we shall characterize A-free sets in universal algebras. Our first characterization follows immediately from the definition and was noticed by Marczewski in [\cite=M2].

A subset B  ⊂  A of a universal algebra (A,A) is A-free if and only if for any algebraic operations α,β∈A and functions x∈BSα, y∈BSβ the equality α(x) = β(y) implies that [formula] for any function f:B  →  A.

For unital substitution-stable universal algebras this characterization can be improved as follows.

A subset B  ⊂  A of a unital substitution-stable universal algebra (A,A) is A-free if and only if for any distinct algebraic operations α,β∈A with Sα = Sβ the inequality α(x)  ≠  β(x) holds for each injective function x∈BSα = BSβ.

To prove the "only if" part, assume that the set B is A-free. Fix two distinct algebraic operations α,β∈A such that Sα = Sβ = S for some finite set S  ⊂  ω. We need to show that α(x)  ≠  β(x) for each injective function x∈BS.

Since α  ≠  β, there is a function y∈BS such that α(y)  ≠  β(y). Using the injectivity of x, choose a function f:B  →  A such that [formula]. Since B is A-free, there is a function :A(B)  →  A such that [formula] for any γ∈A and z∈ASγ. In particular, [formula], which implies α(x)  ≠  β(x).

To prove the "if" part, assume that the set B is not A-free. Applying Proposition [\ref=p3.3], find algebraic operations α,β∈A and functions x∈BSα, y∈BSβ such that α(x) = β(y) and [formula] for some function f:B  →  A. Fix any bijective function [formula] defined on a finite subset S  ⊂  ω. Consider the functions [formula] and [formula], which induce the substitution operators σ*α:AS  →  ASα and σ*β:AS  →  ASβ. Since the operation family A is stable under substitutions, the algebraic operations [formula] and [formula] belong to the family A. Observe that [formula]. On the other hand,

[formula]

implies that α̃  ≠  .

By Proposition [\ref=p1.1], each strongly A-independent subset B  ⊂  A of a universal algebra (A,A) is A-independent.

Let (A,A) be a unital [formula]-regular substitution-stable universal algebra of cardinality |A|  ≥  2. Each A-free subset B  ⊂  A is strongly A-independent.

First we prove that [formula]. Assume conversely that [formula] contains some point b.

Since |A|  ≥  2, we can find two functions f1,f2:B  →  A such that f1(b)  ≠  f2(b). Since B is A-free, for every i∈{1,2}, there is a function i:A(B)  →  A such that [formula] for any α∈A and x∈BSα.

The universal algebra (A,A) is unital and hence contains the identity algebraic operation α:A1  →  A, α:(a)  ↦  a. For this operation we get [formula] and hence 1(b)  ≠  2(b).

On the other hand, the inclusion [formula] yields a 0-ary operation β∈A such that [formula] where [formula] is the unique element of the power [formula]. Then for every i∈{1,2}, the choice of i guarantees that [formula] and hence 1(b) = b = 2(b), which contradicts the inequality 1(b)  ≠  2(b) proved earlier. Hence [formula].

Next, we prove that [formula] for any subsets B1,B2  ⊂  B. This equality is trivial if B1  ⊂  B2 or B2  ⊂  B1. So we assume that both complements [formula] and [formula] are not empty. Assume that [formula] and find a point [formula]. For the point [formula], there are algebraic operations α,β∈A and functions x∈BSα1, y∈BSβ2 such that α(x) = a = β(y). Using a similar reasoning as in the proof of Proposition [\ref=p3.4] we may assume that x and y are injective

Let us show that the operation α is not constant. In the opposite case, the [formula]-regularity of A, yields a 0-ary operation γ∈A such that [formula]. Then [formula], which contradicts the choice of a. Next, we prove that the intersection [formula] is not empty. Assuming the converse and using the fact that the operation α is not constant, find a function x'∈ASα such that α(x')  ≠  β(y). Since the subsets x(Sα) and y(Sβ) of B are disjoint, we can find a function f:B  →  A such that [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Thus the intersection [formula] is not empty and we can choose a function f:B  →  A such that [formula] and [formula]. Such a choice of f guarantees that [formula] and then [formula] implies that [formula]. Since the set B is A-free, the function f can be extended to a function :A(B)  →  A such that [formula] for each γ∈A and z∈BSγ. In particular,

[formula]

This contradiction completes the proof of the strong A-independence of the set B.

Proposition [\ref=p3.5] shows that for a subset of a unital [formula]-regular substitution-stable universal algebra (A,A) we have the following implications:

[formula]

The first implication cannot be reversed as shown by the following simple example.

There is a clone (A,) containing an infinite strongly [formula]-independent subset B  ⊂  X such that each [formula]-free subset of A is empty.

Consider the linear algebra c00 consisting of all functions [formula] with finite support [formula]. This algebra is endowed with the operation family [formula] consisting of two binary operations (of addition and multiplication) and continuum many unary operations [formula] of multiplication by a real number t. The clone [formula] of A contains the subfamily A' consisting of all polynomials [formula] of one variable, equal to zero at the zero function.

The set [formula] of characteristic functions of singletons is strongly [formula]-independent.

It is easy to check that for each subset B'  ⊂  B its [formula]-hull (B') is equal to the linear subspace [formula] where [formula]. It follows that [formula] and for any two subsets B1,B2  ⊂  B we get

[formula]

which means that the subset B is strongly independent.

Any non-empty subset B  ⊂  A is not A'-free and hence is not [formula]-free.

Fix any function b∈B. This function has finite support [formula]. Then b and all its finite powers bn, n > 0, belong to the finite-dimensional linear subspace [formula] of c00. Consequently, the set {bn + 1:0  ≤  n  ≤  |F|} is linearly dependent, which allows us to find a non-zero vector [formula] such that [formula]. This means that p(b) = 0 for the non-zero polynomial [formula]. Since the polynomial p∈A' is non-zero, there is a vector [formula] such that p(y)  ≠  0. Let f:B  →  c00 be any function such that f(b) = y.

Assuming that the set B is A'-free, we could find a function :A'(B)  →  c00 such that [formula]. But (p(b)) = 0  ≠  p(y) = p(f(b)). This contradiction completes the proof.

As we saw in Proposition [\ref=p1.2], the C-independence is equivalent to the strong C-independence for closure operators of matroid type. In contrast, the notions of an A-independent set and a A-free set are not be equivalent (even in presence of the MacLane-Steinitz exchange property). The following simple example is taken from [\cite=Gould].

Consider the 2-element set A = {0,1} and the set A  =  {  ·  } containing the binary operation ·  :A  ×  A  →  A of multiplication. It follows that each subset of A is an A-subalgebra, which implies that the set A is A-independent. By a trivial reason the A-hull operator on X has the MacLane-Steinitz exchange property and hence is a closure operator of matroid type. However, the set A is not A-free, as the unique non-identity bijection f:A  →  A is not a homomorphism of A.

According to [\cite=Gould], a universal algebra [formula] is called an independence algebra if the operator of [formula]-hull has the MacLane-Steinitz exchange property and each [formula]-independent subset of A is [formula]-free. Independent algebras were thoroughly studied in [\cite=Gould], [\cite=AF] and much earlier in [\cite=Nar1], [\cite=Nar2] (as v*-algebras).

Free sets in powers of universal algebras

In this section we shall construct free sets of large cardinality in powers of universal algebras. We start with studying free sets in a power [formula] of the Boolean clone [formula] consisting of the doubleton 2 = {0,1} and the family B of all possible algebraic operations on 2.

It turns out that BX-free subsets of 2X coincide with independent sets, well studied in Set Theory [\cite=JW].

Let us recall [\cite=JW] that a family F of subsets of a set X is called independent if for any finite disjoint sets F1,F2  ⊂  F the intersection

[formula]

is not empty.

Identifying each subset F  ⊂  X with its characteristic function χF:X  →  2 = {0,1}, we can reformulate the notion of an independent family of sets in the language of an independent function family. Namely, a function family F  ⊂  2X is independent if for any pairwise distinct functions [formula] their diagonal product (fi)i < n:X  →  2n is surjective.

For any set X a function family F  ⊂  2X is independent if and only it is BX-free in the clone [formula].

To prove the "if" part, assume that F is BX-free but not independent. Then there are pairwise distinct functions [formula] whose diagonal product δ  =  Δi < nξi:X  →  2n, δ:x  ↦  (ξi(x))i < n is not surjective and hence the set [formula] is not empty. Let α,β:2n  →  2 be two algebraic operations on 2 defined by α- 1(1) = F and [formula]. They induce the algebraic operations αX,βX:(2X)n  →  2X on 2X. It follows that for the function ξ:n  →  F, ξ:i  ↦  ξi, we get αX(ξ) = βX(ξ).

On the other hand, Since αX  ≠  βX, there is a function :n  →  2X such that αX()  ≠  βX(). Now choose any function f:F  →  2X such that [formula]. Since F is BX-free, there is a function :BX(F)  →  2X such that [formula] for any algebraic operation γ∈B with Sγ = n. In particular, [formula], which contradicts αX(ξ) = βX(ξ). This contradiction completes the proof of the "if" part.

To prove the "only if" part, assume that F is independent but not BX-free. By Proposition [\ref=p3.4], there are two distinct operations α,β∈B such that Sα = S = Sβ for some finite set S  ⊂  ω and αX(ξ) = βX(ξ) for some injective function ξ:S  →  F. The function ξ can be written in the form (ξi)i∈S where ξi  =  ξ(i)∈F. The independence of F guarantees that the diagonal product (ξi)i∈S:X  →  2S, δ = (ξi)i∈S:x  ↦  (ξi(x))i∈S of these functions is surjective. Then α  ≠  β implies [formula], which yields a point x∈X such that [formula]. Now observe that

[formula]

which contradicts αX(ξ) = βX(ξ).

By a classical Fichtenholtz-Katorovitch-Hausdorff Theorem 17.20 [\cite=JW], the power-set P(X) of each infinite set X contains an independent family F  ⊂  P(X) of cardinality |F| = |2X| = |P(X)|. Reformulating this result with help of Proposition [\ref=p4.1], we get the following result:

For each infinite set X the power-clone [formula] contains a BX-free subset B  ⊂  2X of cardinality |B| = |2X|.

In fact, Corollary [\ref=c4.2] is a partial case of the following theorem, which is the main result of this paper.

Assume that a universal algebra [formula] has cardinality |A|  ≥  2. For each infinite set X of cardinality |X|  ≥  |A| the function algebra [formula] contains an AX-free subset F  ⊂  AX of cardinality |F| = 2|X|.

Let [formula] be the clone of the operation family A. It has cardinality [formula]. Since each X-free subset of AX is AX-free, we lose no generality assuming that A is a clone. In particular, A is unital, [formula]-regular and substitution-stable.

For each finite subset S  ⊂  ω, consider the family

[formula]

and observe that it has cardinality |TS|  ≤  |A  ×  A  ×  XS|  ≤  |X|. Then the union [formula] where S runs over all finite subsets of ω also has cardinality |T|  ≤  |X| and hence admits an enumeration T  =  {(αx,βx,sx):x∈X} by points of the set X. By the definition of the family T, for every x∈X the algebraic operations αx and βx are distinct. Consequently, we can choose a function px:Sx  →  A defined on the set Sx = Sαx = Sβx such that αx(px)  ≠  βx(px).

Using Fichtenholtz-Katorovitch-Hausdorff Theorem 17.20 [\cite=JW], fix an independent subfamily U  ⊂  P(X) of cardinality |U| = 2|X|.

For each set U∈U define a function fU:X  →  A assigning to a point x∈X the point px(i) where i is a unique point of the set s- 1x(U)  ⊂  Ux if this set is a singleton, and an arbitrary point of A otherwise.

We claim that the set F  =  {fU}U∈U  ⊂  AX has cardinality |F| = 2|X| and is AX-free.

The function f:U  →  F, f:U  ↦  fU, is bijective and hence |F| = |U| = 2|X|.

Given two distinct sets U,V∈U, we should prove that fU   ≠   fV. By the unitality, the operation family A contains the identity operation [formula], [formula]. Consider the embeddings

[formula]

The substitution-stability of A implies that the algebraic operations [formula], α:(a,b)  ↦  a, and [formula], β:(a,b)  ↦  b, belong to the operation family A. It follows from |A|  ≥  2 that α  ≠  β.

By the independence of U∋U,V, there is a function s:2  →  X such that [formula] and [formula]. The triple (α,β,s) belongs to the family T2  ⊂  T and hence is equal to (αx,βx,sx) for some x∈X. Then px∈A2 is a function such that px(0) = αx(px)  ≠  βx(px) = px(1). The definition of the functions fU and fV guarantees that fU(x) = px(0)  ≠  px(1) = fV(x) and hence fU  ≠  fV.

The set F is A-free.

Assuming that F is not A-free and applying Proposition [\ref=p3.4], find a finite subset S  ⊂  ω, an injective function ξ:S  →  F and two distinct algebraic operations α,β∈A such that Sα = S = Sβ and αX(ξ) = βX(ξ).

For every i∈S find a set Ui∈U such that ξ(i) = fUi. The independence of the family U guarantees the existence of a function s:S  →  X such that [formula]. It follows that s- 1(Ui) = {i} for each i∈S.

The triple (α,β,s) belongs to the family TS  ⊂  T and hence is equal to (αx,βx,sx) for some point x∈X. For every i∈S the definition of the function fUi guarantees that fUi(x) = px(i). Let δx:AX  →  A, δx:g  ↦  g(x), denote the x-th coordinate projection. We claim that [formula]. Indeed, for each i∈S we get [formula].

Applying the function δx to the equality αX(ξ) = βX(ξ), we get [formula]. On the other hand, [formula], which is a desired contradiction.

For some concrete universal algebras, in particular, for the linear algebra [formula] of all functions from an infinite set X to a field [formula], a free subalgebra [formula] with 2|X| generators (and some additional properties) has been constructed in [\cite=BGP].

Let [formula] be a universal algebra with |A|  ≥  2, X be an infinite set of cardinality |X|  ≥  |A|, and F  ⊂  AX be a maximal AX-free subset. Is |F|  ≥  |2X|?
