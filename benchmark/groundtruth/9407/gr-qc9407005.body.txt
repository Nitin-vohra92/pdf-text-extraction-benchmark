A class of quasi-stationary regular line elements for the Schwarzschild geometry

The quasi-stationary spherically symmetric line element in curvature coordinates (labelled (t,r,θ,φ)) is given by

[formula]

where dΩ2 is the metric of a unit sphere (dθ2  +   sin 2(θ)dφ2). The term "curvature coordinates" is derived from the coefficient of dΩ2, and the term "quasi-stationary" is derived from the fact that for the metric ([\ref=eq:metric]), ξα  =  δα t is a Killing vector that is timelike for a(r) > 0.

The purpose of this note is to solve the vacuum Einstein equations

[formula]

in terms of the coordinates defining the line element ([\ref=eq:metric]). The system is over determined and any one of a(r), b(r) or c(r) can be prescribed. We content ourselves here by simply specifying constants.

With c(r) = c =   ≥  0, we solve ([\ref=eq:einstein]) and obtain (in geometrical units)

[formula]

where ε  =    ±  1. The constant m is the effective gravitational mass. The constant c has no invariant physical significance. (Whereas the surfaces t =  have distinct properties for different choices of c, this is merely a choice of slicing of the spacetime.) With 0  ≤  c  ≤  1, the r-t subspaces of the metric ([\ref=eq:solution]) are free of coordinate singularities over the range 0 < r <   ∞  . The familiar Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates are obtained by setting c = 0. The coordinates discussed, and exploited in a modern context, recently by Kraus and Wilczek [\cite=KW] are obtained by setting c = 1. These coordinates have an interesting history [\cite=history]. I am not aware of a previous discussion of the class given by ([\ref=eq:solution]). (However, in view of the elementary nature of the problem, and solution, it would be somewhat of a surprise if the form ([\ref=eq:solution]) is actually new!) Whereas with 0  ≤  c  ≤  1 the line element ([\ref=eq:solution]) is free of coordinate singularities, the coordinates are incomplete. The completion can be carried out for 0  ≤  c  ≤  1 exactly analogously to the case c = 0 that is thoroughly treated in standard texts.

The procedure that yielded the form ([\ref=eq:solution]) fails to give anything of further interest. In particular, setting a(r) = 1 (by choice of scale of t) leads, with ([\ref=eq:einstein]), only to Minkowski space. The forms obtained with b(r) = b =   ≥  0 all have the familiar coordinate singularity at r = 2m.
