1. Introduction

In their pioneer paper1 Nambu and Jona-Lasinio (NJL), using the analogy with superconducive mechanism, had shown an intimate connection of unitary-nonequivalent transformations of quantum states with the existence of nontrivial vacuum. Later this approach was generalized on a case of quark interaction in chiral QCD limit (see, e.g., review2). In this paper we consider one particle excitations of vacuum and its energy spectrums for wide set of permissible transformations. We show that besides the known NJL solution there always exists one more excitation with a linear spectrum on momentum and this fact is a property of any contact four -fermionic SU(2)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1)-symmetric interaction.

2. Analysis of the NJL solution.

The NJL Hamiltonian is

[formula]

where [formula], color and flavor indexes on ψ are assumed. The NJL transformation representing Heisenberg field ψ(x) at t = 0 in terms of massless spinors u(p),  v(p) leads to the following form of the Heisenberg field (dynamical mapping3)

[formula]

ur(p),  vr(p) are the massless spinors ([formula]) normalized by the usual conditions u+ r(p)us(p) ~   =  v+ r(p)vs(p)  =  δrs. It is a simple exercise to check that the spinors Nr(p) and Mr(p) satisfy the equations:

[formula]

with [formula]. Creation and annihilation operators ar(p),  br(p) and a+ r(p),  b+ r(p) satisfy the conventional anticommutation relations for fermions and are interpreted in a sense of dynamical mappings as operators of excitations of "physical" particles. Vacuum state is defined with respect to them.

Vacuum energy [formula] evaluated by using Eqs.([\ref=2]) is turned out to be a functional of the transformation angles θ(p):

[formula]

where [formula]. Thus, θ(p) "enumerates" all possible vacuums. Variation of θ(p) gives the following condition for the extremum:

[formula]

Another trivial solution corresponds to m*  =  0. To answer the question whether the solution suits for maximum or for minimum of W0 we need to check the sign of functional determinant:

[formula]

[formula]

So, if [formula] this extremum is minimum which is degenerated at m*  =  0 into the inflection point.

The energy spectrum of one-particle excitation E*(k) is determined by the following eigenvalue equation:

[formula]

d+ r(k) stands for a+ r(k) or b+ r(k). Calculating the commutator in the l.h.s. of above equation using the dynamical mapping ([\ref=2]) and omitting three-particle excitations we obtain expression for E*(k):

[formula]

On the solution ([\ref=5]) E*(k) coincides with E(k)

[formula]

Now we want to draw attention to the important fact, that under the functional variation of W0 over θ(k) one more solution is lost, and it should be studied separately. Namely, the solution: θ(k)  =  φ  =  const. This solution, as will be shown below, admits an extremum in W0, and this extremum corresponds to minimum of W0. In this case m* is a linear function of momentum: m*(k)  =  ak, and the expression for the vacuum energy has the form:

[formula]

From ([\ref=9]) we obtain:

[formula]

Eq.([\ref=10]) determines the parameter φ in the extremum point:

[formula]

and this extremum is in fact always minimum (Eq.([\ref=11])). Hereafter to the end of the text we will deal with positive values of c*, so that the minimum existence condition is just restriction c*  <  1 (recall, that we use the system c  =  1) and this means c* is less than speed of light. Inserting the expression of [formula] via c* (Eq.([\ref=12])) at θ(k)  =  φ into Eq.([\ref=8a]) we finally obtain the energy spectrum E* of excitation ([\ref=7]):

[formula]

As one can recognize from Eq.([\ref=13]), c* has the meaning of group velocity of the excitation. Thus, the spectrum is proved to be a linear function of momentum , i.e. "neutrino" type, and the condition of the minimum existence corresponds to the demand c*  <  1. At c*  =  1 the minimum of W0 is degenerated into the inflection point.

So, NJL transformations for the Hamiltonian ([\ref=1]) yield to two types of stable excitations above vacuum. One excitation describes a massive particle with the normal relativistic spectrum, and the mass arising dynamically. The second excitation has the linear energy spectrum. This fact is a consequence of unitary-nonequivalenceness of the transformations ([\ref=2]) from the massless particles to the massive ones causing the vacuum to be nontrivial. As will be shown later appearing of these two types of excitations is not a result of the given transformation ([\ref=2]) and of the Hamiltonian choice ([\ref=1]). They arise generally for any contact four-fermionic SU(2)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1)- globally symmetric interaction. Let us note, eventually, that the NJL transformations can be represented in terms of quantum fields as:

[formula]

[formula]

where q(x)  =  q( + )(x)  +  q( - )(x) is massless spinor field expanded on its frequency parts, and θ(k) is Fourier image of the real function [formula].

3. Model of pseudo-scalar couplings.

Consider now SU(2)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1)-invariant Lagrangian2:

[formula]

Our aim is to quantize the respective Hamiltonian by the dynamical mapping method3 in such a way that the relevant vacuum would contain condensate with the quantum numbers of π-mesons. Therefore, we take generator of the transformations from "physical" fields to the Heisenberg ones (dynamical mapping) exploiting the expression for the axial charge.

[formula]

where [formula] is a "trial" physical massive field with a mass m(k) arbitrarily depending on momentum.

[formula]

ur(k) and vr(k) are massive spinors normalized by the conditions [formula]. Operators ar and br anticommute as:

[formula]

Ic and If are unit flavor and color matrixes (trIα  =  Nα). Wave function g(k) is introduced for "smooth" regularization of divergent integrals and to attach physical meaning to them. If quantums of physical fields are interpreted as in paper3, then g(k) characterizes a momentum distribution inside the excitation, and the integral [formula] determines V* - space volume of this excitation. We normalize |g(k)|2 in such a manner that it is ~  1 in the region where it essentially differs from zero, i.e. we choose:

[formula]

Correspondence with the usual momentum "cut-off" parameter Λ is established due to the equality:

[formula]

So, in the local (over momentum) relations we will put |g(k)|2  =  1 but saving it in the integrals to regulate its convergence. Taking into account all above comments we construct the generator Ĝ from the diagonal (with respect to the frequencies) parts of the axial charge:

[formula]

where [formula] is a unit vector in the flavor space. With such choice of G we obtain the following dynamical mapping:

[formula]

From above it follows that [formula] and [formula] play the role of parameters of Ĝ-transformation, i.e. as in Eq.([\ref=4]) they "enumerate" all possible unitary-nonequivalent vacuums. For the vacuum energy density we find out the expression:

[formula]

where G  =  G1  +  2G1NcNf  +  2G3, and the const does not depend on [formula] and Φ(k). Hence it follows, firstly, that the terms of the Lagrangian ([\ref=15]) corresponding to the vector and axial-vector hadronic currents (ρ and A1 mesons) do not contribute to the vacuum energy density. Secondly, each SU(2)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1)-invariant term of the Lagrangian ([\ref=15]) gives the uniform contribution to W0, so that accounting all the terms of ([\ref=15]) results in the summary constant G. Let us vary W0 on Φ(k), reckoning the physical vacuum to be a minimum of the energy density W0 / V, and equating the variation to zero. Using the relation [formula] we have an integral nonlinear equation for m(k)

[formula]

This equation should be true for the all admitted values of k: 0  ≤  k  <    ∞  . The analysis shows that the equation ([\ref=23]) has the only solution m(k)  =  ak, with a  =  const satisfying the transcendental equation:

[formula]

This equation is thought to connect the parameter [formula] with the constant a. There are many solutions of ([\ref=24]) written as

[formula]

The expression for W0 / V under condition ([\ref=24]) has the following form:

[formula]

denoting

[formula]

and

[formula]

Now, in order to fix the value of [formula] (or a) we have to minimize ([\ref=26]) over [formula]. The very form of ([\ref=26]) hints to take derivative with respect to a rather than [formula], so we do:

[formula]

Thus, as in above, the extremum exists and always corresponds to minimum. First of Eqs.([\ref=27]) links f(a) with c*

[formula]

besides the expression for c* via the parameters of the model at hand coincides exactly with the expression obtained under the NJL transformations Eq.([\ref=12]), while the second of Eqs.([\ref=27]) constrains c*  <  1.

Evaluation of excitation energy E* from Eq.([\ref=7]) results (compare with ([\ref=8a]))

[formula]

What is most surprising, the Eq.([\ref=29a]) exactly coincides with expression ([\ref=13]) on the solution ([\ref=28])

[formula]

If in Eq.([\ref=21]) the parameter [formula] is chosen to be a function of [formula], that corresponds to the input of a function [formula] into the generator Ĝ Eq.([\ref=20]), then it is not hard to make sure that the equation on the extremum of vacuum energy in this case yields for m(k) the NJL solution, i.e. m(k)  =  m*  =  const.

We had studied all possible generators G, composed from the bilinear combinations of fields. From the results of calculations there follows the only conclusion that in the models with the contact four fermionic interaction possessing the SU(2)  ×  SU(2)  ×  U(1) symmetry two types of stable excitations emerge - with the universal expressions for one particle energies Eq.([\ref=8]) or Eq.([\ref=13]) and with respective (in terms of m* or c*) universal expressions for vacuum energies. The linear spectrum at c*  =  1 corresponds to the neutrino spectrum. However, this point cannot be achieved because of two reasons.

First: at c*  =  1 the minimum degenerates into the inflection point.

Second: rewriting (on m(k)  =  ak with 1 / a  =  q0) the expression for the spinor ur(k) in the form

[formula]

and finding out the following behavior of q0 near c*  ~  1

[formula]

one can see, owing to the relativistic factor in Eq.([\ref=31]), the second obstacle to achieve the point c*  =  1.

Finally note, that the relativity - invariant generators Ĝ, constructed from all bilinear combinations of fields can be brought to any of the forms a+b+,ab,ect. However, when the algebra of the generators is observed it is infinite-dimensional because of the relativistic phase volume d3km(k) / E(k), since every generator contains different orders of m(k) / E(k). The exception concerns the case of linear spectrum with m(k) / E(k)  =  const, then algebra is closed and the parameter space becomes finite-dimensional.

It is worth mentioning in a conclusion that the energy spectrum can be rewritten in the more convenient form for the experimental treatment, namely:

[formula]

Here χ0 is a dimensionless number, c is the speed of light in "emptiness", and the vacuum stability condition reduces in this case to χ0  <  1. Parameter [formula] has dimension of energy and, as well as the parameter χ0, is not determined by the initial Lagrangian. Its determination needs a model for the distribution function g(k). In general these parameters should be extracted from experiments. If E* is identified with spectrum of physical neutrino, then we are to suggest the following (probably not complete) list of existing neutrino experiments, where this spectrum has chance to be found:

a) Neutron beta-decay (spectrum of electrons near kinematical bound)

b) Tritium beta-decay (Tr  →  He3  +  e  +  e) at the end of electron energy spectrum, where at present there exists discrepancy between theory and experiment.

c) Double neutrinoless beta-decay (test on the Majorano mass).

d) Solar and atmospherical neutrino (oscillations in "vacuum" and matter).

e) Neutrino signal from the supernova (time delay and oscillations)
