LARGE TOP AND BOTTOM YUKAWA COUPLINGS IN MINIMAL SUPERSYMMETRY E. G. Floratos Physics Department University of Crete Iraklion, Crete Greece and G. K. Leontaris CERN Theory Division 1211 Geneva 23 Switzerland ABSTRACT

We present analytic expressions for the top and bottom Yukawa couplings in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model when both couplings ht,0,hb,0 are large at the unification scale. For sufficiently large ht,0,hb,0, i.e. within ~  (20 - 25)% close to their fixed point values, using as input the central value of the bottom mass mb(mb) = 4.25GeV, we find that the top mass lies in the range mt  ≈  (174 - 178)GeV, while tan β  ≈  (55 - 58). Implications on the evolution of the scalar masses and the radiative symmetry breaking scenario are discussed.

It is widely believed that the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is the most natural extention of the standard theory of strong and electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the MSSM can be naturally embedded in all unified supergravity and superstring constructions. Detailed calculations [formula] taking into account the most recent data on the low energy values of gauge couplings and other measurable parameters, have shown that the above theoretical expectations are correct when supersymmetry breaks at the order of 1TeV and the unification of gauge couplings takes place at the scale of 1016GeV provided that the MSSM fermion and higgs content is used. It was therefore recently realized [formula] that it is time to take a step further and, - in addition to the gauge coupling unification - explore the nature of Yukawa couplings which in the MSSM are treated as free parameters. Grand Unified Theories [formula] predict various relations among them, depending on the precise group chosen by the particular unification scenario. Furthermore, String theories relate the fate of Yukawa couplings with that of the gauge constants. It is expected that some of them might be of the order of the common gauge coupling constant at the unification point. In fact, in all string scenaria there appears a hierarchical form of the quark and lepton Yukawa couplings, due to additional U(1) symmetries which usually allow only one generation of fermions to receive masses from the trilinear superpotential terms. Concentrating on the quark sector, this would mean that the only tree level Yukawa couplings which may be large and comparable to the unified gauge coupling, are ht and hb. Knowing their initial values at the GUT scale, we may determine their low energy values by evolving them down using the renormalization group equations. This has been done in many recent works[formula] using numerical methods. In the present letter, we wish to present analytic forms for the above couplings, when both are large at the unification scale. Particular solutions as in the interesting case of ht,0  ≈  hb,0 have already appeared in the literature[\cite=grou] [\cite=dl]. Such forms might prove extremely useful, for example, in the calculation of the scalar masses and the Higgs mass parameters. In particular, the latter play a very important role in the radiative symmetry breaking scenario [formula]. In particular in the large tan β scenario where both couplings are large, the higgs mass-squared parameters may both be driven negative and the stability of the neutral higgs potential will be questionable. Therefore, analytic forms for the mass parameters can simplify the analysis of the minimization conditions and provide a better insight of the role of the Yukawa coupling contributions to the scalar masses.

In the following, we will assume that only ht,hb, Yukawa couplings are large. We will assume that all other Yukawa couplings, including hτ are small and will ignore them. Thus, we do not implement the minimal GUT relation [formula] at the GUT scale. We should point out that this happens very often in the case of String GUTs (as in the case of the flipped SU(5) [formula]), and therefore it is of particular interest. Nevertheless, our solutions are still a good approximation even in the case of appreciable initial hτ,0 values.

Ignoring all other Yukawa couplings, the coupled differential system of ht - hb couplings is written as follows,

[formula]

with

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] for SU(3),SU(2) and U(1) respectively. In order to solve ([\ref=eq:1]-[\ref=eq:2]), we choose first to absorbe the gauge coefficients GQ,GB by making the transformations:

[formula]

where

[formula]

with t0  =   ln MGUT. Then, by observing that γQ  ≈  γB, since their only difference is only a small coefficient in the U(1) factor, it can be seen easily that the D.E's ([\ref=eq:1],[\ref=eq:2]), in the approximation γQ  =  γB transform as follows

[formula]

[formula]

This last coupled system can give a solution for x in terms of y and vice versa, leading to the algebraic equation

[formula]

Furthermore substructing ([\ref=eq:6]) from ([\ref=eq:7]), we may obtain the following D.E.

[formula]

while (x + y) can be substituted from ([\ref=eq:8]) to give a differential equation for the difference ω  =  x - y of the form

[formula]

where the parameter k0  =  4x0y0 / (x0 - y0)7 / 6 depends on the initial conditions [formula] and [formula].

In order to solve eqn.([\ref=eq:9]) we make the following transformation

[formula]

Eqn.([\ref=eq:9]) can be put in the form

[formula]

which can be integrated to give the solution in terms of Hypergeometric functions [formula], i.e.

[formula]

As a + b - c =  - 1 / 2 < 0 and z =  - 1 / u, the above solution is valid in the entire circle |z| = 1, i.e. as long as |u|  ≥  1. Once the initial values, x0,y0 are chosen, the last equation can determine the value of the difference ω = x - y. (Ĩ(t) can be calculated for any given scale μ.) Then, x and y (and therefore ht and hb), can be found with the use of Eq([\ref=eq:8]). One finds

[formula]

In the following, we choose to distinguish two separate cases, depending on the value of k0 where the results exhibit a rather interesting simplicity.

i) k0 <  < 1. In this case ([\ref=eq:9]) is easily integrated to give

[formula]

with [formula]. Substitution of ([\ref=eq:11]) into ([\ref=eq:3]) and integration leads to the result

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eq:7]), can also be integrated in the same way resulting to a similar formula for the bottom quark mass.

ii) k0  ≫  1. In this case we can ignore the second term in eq.([\ref=eq:9]). A straightforward integration then gives

[formula]

Returning back to the initial differential system, we may obtain the formulae for the top and bottom Yukawa couplings. For the top-quark we obtain

[formula]

while for the bottom

[formula]

where

[formula]

In order to compare our analytic results with numerical methods, we have also solved the RGEs ([\ref=eq:1]-[\ref=eq:2]) numerically for some particular cases. As an example we present here the results obtained for initial value of the top Yukawa coupling close to its fixed point, i.e. ht,0 = 3.5 and hb,0 = 1.5. The numerical solution gives ht = 1.02 and hb = 0.955 at the scale mt  ≈  170GeV, while the analytic expressions obtained above give ht = 1.025 and hb = 0.957. We have checked that this accuracy holds for all the regions of validity of the above analytic expressions.

In Table I, we present values of the top mass, when both ht,0 and hb,0 couplings are large. In particular, we choose two characteristic values of the top-Yukawa coupling, (one of them very close to its fixed point) and calculate mt (running mass) and tan β, assuming a central value for the bottom quark, i.e. [formula]. Here nb includes the running from the scale ~  mt down to the scale mb and is taken to be nb  ≈  1.4.

A very interesting inference from this table is that the top quark has a mass around 175 GeV which is close to the central value found by CDF [formula], while tan β  ≈  (55 - 58). We note however, that sparticle exchange corrections on mb[\cite=aras] [\cite=grou] or thresholds and other uncertainties[\cite=unce] may result to small mt corrections for specific ht,0,hb,0 regions.

Analytic solutions for the large hb,t Yukawa couplings are of particular interest in supersymmetric theories. The masses of the higgses responsible for the electroweak breaking as well as the scalar masses of the third generation receive large negative contributions when hb,ht are also large. In the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario [formula], one of the higgs mass-squared parameters should become negative. This is in fact possible because of the large negative Yukawa corrections. However, when both Yukawa couplings are large, both higgs mass parameters receive large contributions. Thus, when dealing with the RGE of the scalar masses it is very useful to have analytic expressions for the Yukawa functions which appear in the role of scale-dependent coefficients in the Differential Equations of the former.

In the following, we discuss briefly the effects of ht,hb couplings to the Higgs and scalar quark masses of the third generation, disentagling the coupled differential system of them and reducing it down to a simple differential equation of second order which may be solved either numerically or by standard analytic mathematical methods.

We start first by reminding the reader with the exact solution of the scalar masses [formula], mt̃R  =  U2, and [formula] in the case where ht  ≫  hb, and tan β≃O(1). It has been found in this case that the above scalar masses are given by a simple formula [formula]

[formula]

where, δ2A(t) has been estimated to be much smaller than [formula] and can be ignored for the present purposes, while:

[formula]

where I(t) has already been defined in solving Eq.([\ref=eq:11]), while

[formula]

The coefficients CUn can be found in the literature [formula]. Notice that in the derivation of the above, it was assumed that ht,0  ≫  hb,0 while hb,0 was ommitted from the equations. However, in the case where hb,0  ~  ht,0 this is no longer valid. Since both Yukawa couplings are ht / b,0  ~  O(1), both higgs mass-squared parameters m2H1,m2H2 receive large negative contributions and play a very important role in the stability of the neutral higgs potential. This can be easily seen from the minimization conditions [formula], where [formula], which result to well known equations

[formula]

where μ2i = m2Hi  +  μ2  +  σ2i, with σ2i being the corrections[formula] to the Higgs potential from the one-loop contributions and μ the higgs mixing term. Therefore, these contributions should be calculated with great care. Analytic expressions, if possible, may be extremely useful in the minimization conditions of the potential.

In the following, we use the same techniques as in ref.[formula] to calculate the Higgs and scalar masses in the case tan β  ≫  1, or equivalently when hb,0,ht,0 are large. The relevant RGEs can be found in the literature[formula]. We define

[formula]

where mUi have been defined previously while [formula], mR  =  D2, and [formula]. By recalling the same arguments used in the solution of scalar masses for the case ht,0  ≫  hb,0 we can conclude that the contribution of the trilinear parameters AU,AD do not play important role in the final solutions for the scalar masses in the present case too. Therefore, to simplify the subsequent analysis, we drop AU,AD terms (the extention of the solution to the most general case is straightforward). It is easily then observed that one can write the equations for the sums of scalar masses in the following form:

[formula]

where GU  =  GQ  +  GH2  +  GUc and GD  =  GQ  +  GH1  +  GBc To simplify the above coupled equations we make the following transformations

[formula]

Then Equs([\ref=eq:28]-[\ref=eq:29]) can be written in the form

[formula]

It is trivial to check that D.E. ([\ref=eq:31]) in the case ht  ≫  hb can be solved independently giving the solution ([\ref=eq:21]) for the up-squarks and the higgs H2. Moreover, using the fact that GU  ≈  GD  ≈  2  GQ, one can easily obtain an exact solution of equs([\ref=eq:31]-[\ref=eq:32]). In the general case, ([\ref=eq:31]-[\ref=eq:32]) can combine to two simple, second order differential equations of the form

[formula]

with

[formula]

and

[formula]

These are both decoupled and have a standard second order form with a non-homogeneous part on the R.H.S. Since the coefficients are known functions of the analytic solutions hb(t),ht(t) they can be solved either numerically or in particular cases by standard methods yielding expressions for the sums of mUi,mDi . Then the expressions for the individual masses may be obtained in the way described in ref[\cite=leo]. Detailed results of the above procedure will be presented elsewere.
