Abstract

By introducing a [formula] term into the action of the c = 1 matrix model of two-dimensional quantum gravity, we find a new critical behavior for random surfaces. The planar limit of the path integral generates multiple spherical "bubbles" which touch one another at single points. At a special value of g, the sum over connected surfaces behaves as Δ2 log Δ, where Δ is the cosmological constant (the sum over surfaces of area A goes as A- 3). For comparison, in the conventional c = 1 model the sum over planar surfaces behaves as Δ2  /   log Δ.

Introduction

In recent years a considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the statistical mechanics of random surfaces. This problem is relevant to Polyakov string theory in non-critical dimensions. Thanks to the matrix model techniques, we now have a thorough understanding of random surfaces embedded in one dimension [\cite=ceq1] [\cite=GK] [\cite=Trieste] or less [\cite=clt1]. Little is known, however, about the physically more interesting higher dimensional embeddings. With this in mind, it is important to continue formulating and solving new matrix models.

One interesting modification of the conventional one-matrix model was solved in ref. [\cite=Das]. A new type of critical behavior arises when a term of the form g(Tr  Φ2)2 is added to the action, leading to an integral over the N  ×  N hermitian matrix Φ of the form

[formula]

The large N limit of this quantity has an interesting geometrical interpretation. Feynman graphs of the perturbation theory in λ generate the usual connected closed random surfaces, while the g(Tr  Φ2)2 term can glue a pair of such surfaces together at a point. This point can be resolved into a tiny neck (a wormhole), so that the network of such touching surfaces can be assigned an overall genus. In the leading large N limit one picks out the surfaces of genus zero, which look like trees of spherical bubbles such that any two bubbles touch at most once, and a bubble is not allowed to touch itself.

The authors of ref. [\cite=Das] found a critical line in the (λ,g) plane where the free energy Eq. ([\ref=czero]) becomes singular. There exists a critical value gt such that, for g < gt, the singularity in the function of λ is characterized by γstr =  - 1 / 2. In this phase the touching of random surfaces is irrelevant and one finds the conventional c = 0 behavior. For g > gt, on the other hand, γstr = 1 / 2, and one finds branched polymer behavior, which is dominated by the touching. Most interestingly, for g = gt, the authors of ref. [\cite=Das] found a new type of critical behavior with γstr = 1 / 3. The interpretation of this is not completely clear, but it has been suggested that at this point one has an effective theory for random surfaces embedded in more than one dimension [\cite=abc]. In fact, after some fine tuning, theories with γstr = 1 / n can be formulated [\cite=Das] [\cite=abc] [\cite=korchemsky].

In view of these results, a continued study of the g(Tr  Φ2)2 term is warranted. In this paper we investigate its effect on random surfaces embedded in one dimension. The relevant model is the matrix quantum mechanics defined by the path integral

[formula]

where Φ is an N  ×  N hermitian matrix. T will be taken to ∞   in the end, but we retain it as a finite quantity for the time being. In the large N limit we find a critical line where the free energy is singular. As in the model Eq. ([\ref=czero]), there exists a critical value gt which separates the conventional matrix model behavior (in this case c = 1) from the branched polymer phase. For g = gt we find a new critical behavior: the sum over connected surfaces of genus zero behaves as Δ2 log Δ, where Δ is the cosmological constant. This should be compared with the usual c = 1 behavior, Δ2  /   log Δ. Our modified critical behavior is much simpler after we carry out the inverse Laplace transform: the sum over surfaces of fixed area A behaves as A- 3. The corresponding formula for c = 1 is more complicated due to logarithmic corrections.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section [\ref=Fermion], we show how the modified c = 1 model can be reduced to a fermionic system. In section [\ref=Phase], we find conditions on the ground state of the fermionic hamiltonian which allow us to find the critical points of the model and evaluate γstr. We end with a brief discussion in section [\ref=Discuss].

Reduction to fermions

The sum over connected surfaces is given, up to a factor, by the free energy

[formula]

In the N  →    ∞   limit, the leading term of F (which is the only term we will consider in this paper) is O(N2). This dominant term generates touching spherical bubbles embedded in one dimension. To be more explicit, the single trace terms in Eq. ([\ref=PartF]) generate planar, quartic Feynman graphs embedded in one dimension: these are the individual bubbles, which look just like ordinary c = 1 surfaces. The double trace term, [formula], gives rise to a pair of "touching" propagators. When these propagators are incorporated into two different bubbles, we interpret the bubbles as touching. Arrangements where a pair of bubbles touch in more than one place, or where a bubble reaches around and touches itself, are suppressed by a factor 1 / N2 and thus correspond to O(1) corrections to F.

The path integral in Eq. ([\ref=PartF]) can be written as a transition amplitude

[formula]

In the T  →    ∞   limit, F is - N times the ground state energy of this hamiltonian. The ground state must be a SU(N)-invariant function of Φ, which is to say a symmetric function of the eigenvalues xi of Φ: dependence on "angular" degrees of freedom can only raise the energy. As in the c = 1 model, the key step is to pass to a fermionic system, in which the ground state is an anti-symmetric function of the xi. If Δ(xi) is the Vandermonde determinant of the eigenvalues xi of Φ, then

[formula]

where Hf is the fermionic hamiltonian:

[formula]

The [formula] term introduces interactions among the fermions. These interactions can be taken care of by a self-consistent field approach, analogous to Hartree-Fock calculations in multi-electron atoms. For the purpose of finding the ground state energy of Hf to leading order in N, it is permissible to make the replacement

[formula]

An intuitive way to justify this replacement is to consider Tr  Φ2 as varying slightly around its expectation value: Tr  Φ2  =  〈Tr  Φ2〉  +  δTr  Φ2. Expanding [formula] to first order in δTr  Φ2 yields Eq. ([\ref=Replace]).

Applying Eq. ([\ref=Replace]) to Eq. ([\ref=FermionH]) turns Hf into a constant plus a sum of N single-particle hamiltonians:

[formula]

We write the single-particle hamiltonian as

[formula]

Since our modified matrix model reduces to free fermions, its solution proceeds essentially along the lines of the usual c = 1 solution. However, the necessity of imposing a self-consistency condition adds an extra ingredient which, as we will show, can modify the nature of the critical behavior.

Leading order solution

To obtain the ground state energy of Hf to leading order in N as N  →    ∞  , it suffices to use semi-classical techniques. We regard the N fermions with single-particle hamiltonian h(x) as a Fermi gas in the potential [formula]. If the Fermi energy is eF, then the particle density in x is

[formula]

Given λ and g, the values of eF and c are determined by a normalization condition and a self-consistency condition:

[formula]

If we let E be 1 / N times the ground state energy of Hf, then

[formula]

As a check on the self-consistent field method, one may easily show that

[formula]

These results agree with what one finds by explicit differentiation of Eq. ([\ref=PartF]) with respect to λ and g.

At this point it is convenient to rescale x and h(x) as follows:

[formula]

We also define a rescaled Fermi energy [formula]. The highest possible value for μF is μc  =  1 / 4: at this energy, the fermions completely fill the local well of V(y).

Upon rescaling, Eq. ([\ref=EFandC]) becomes

[formula]

where [formula]. c can be eliminated from these equations to yield

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=Permit]) and ([\ref=glCurve]) represent necessary conditions on the ground state, but as we shall see, they are not quite sufficient, as there are sometimes two possible values of μF for a given λ and g. It will not be hard to tell which represents the true ground state.

Eq. ([\ref=glCurve]) determines a family of curves in λ-g space that depends on the single parameter μF. Fig. ([\ref=Waterfall]) shows twenty of these curves. The outer envelope of all the curves is the locus of critical points where the perturbation series that generates the random surfaces begins to diverge. To see this, suppose one varies λ and g from 0 toward criticality. As long as the point (λ,g) is inside the outer envelope, there is a ground state of Hf, and E is finite. But as soon as (λ,g) crosses the envelope, there is no solution to Eq. ([\ref=Permit]), so E and hence F are undefined.

There are two regions of the critical curve. For [formula], the curve given by Eq. ([\ref=glCurve]) with μF  =  μc is the critical curve. For g > gt, the critical curve is tangent to a curve given by Eq. ([\ref=glCurve]) with μF  <  μc. Because of the different critical behaviors we shall find in these two regions, we shall call the region g  <  gt the c = 1 region and the region g > gt the branched polymer region. While the critical behaviors in these two regions have been found in other models, right at g = gt we find something new.

In all the calculations we present, we continue to use the quartic potential, λTr  Φ4, that we started out with in Eq. ([\ref=PartF]). As a check on universality, however, we have performed the same calculations with a cubic potential, and we found the same regions of the critical curve and the same three types of critical behavior.

Critical behavior in the c = 1 region

Let us pick a point (λc,gc) on the c = 1 part of the critical curve. To determine the critical behavior of E as λ  →  λc with g fixed at gc, it suffices to calculate ∂E  /  ∂λ, which from Eq. ([\ref=dEdl]) can be shown to be

[formula]

To analyze the behavior of I, J, and K for μF near μc, let us set μF  =  μc  -  μ and write

[formula]

A standard result from c = 1 calculations is

[formula]

which means [formula]. To calculate δJ and δK, let us first define [formula], so that [formula]. Now,

[formula]

Keeping terms of order μ and larger, we find

[formula]

Now we perform a perturbation of λ away from λc with g fixed at gc. If one defines z  =  (λ  /  I)1 / 3 and zc  =  (λc  /  Ic)1 / 3, Eq. ([\ref=glCurve]) becomes

[formula]

Using this along with Eq. ([\ref=LeadingJK]) one can derive

[formula]

In this and all the rest of our calculations in this section, we retain terms only up to O(μ).

Before continuing with the calculation of the critical behavior of E, let us note how Eq. ([\ref=Varyl]) can be used to determine the point (λt,gt) where the μF  =  μc curve ceases to coincide with the critical line. Eq. ([\ref=Varyl]) actually applies to any point (λc,gc) on the μF  =  μc curve, except when 1  -  3z2c  =  0. If we set δλ  =  0, then Eq. ([\ref=Varyl]) becomes

[formula]

which is a condition on λc that determines where the μF  =  μc  -  μ curve intersects the μF  =  μc curve. Now, (λt,gt) is the point where the μF  =  μc curve just starts to meet curves with lower μF. Hence λt can be determined by letting μ  →  0 in Eq. ([\ref=Intersect]). Since the dominant term on the right hand side of Eq. ([\ref=Intersect]) is the one involving δI  /  Ic, we must have z2c  →  5 / 6, whence [formula] and [formula].

Now let us see how E behaves near criticality. Retaining terms up to O(μ) as usual,

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=Varyl]) and ([\ref=LeadingE]) lead to the existence of two different types of critical behavior. First, let us take λc  >  λt (gc < gt). In this case Eqs. ([\ref=Varyl]) and ([\ref=LeadingE]) combine to give

[formula]

As in the case of ordinary c = 1, we define the cosmological constant Δ by λ  =  λc  -  Δ. To leading order in Δ,

[formula]

which is the behavior typical of ordinary c = 1. The leading nonanalytic behavior of E is

[formula]

which again is typical of c = 1. Our conclusion is that, for g < gt, the touching of random surfaces is irrelevant in the sense that it does not destroy the c = 1 behavior.

If we fix g  =  gt and let λ  →  λt, then we get a different critical behavior: Eq. ([\ref=Varyl]) becomes δλ  /  λt  =   - 5μ, so that the leading order relation between Δ and μ is just

[formula]

The fact that Δ and μ are simply proportional to each other is the crucial feature of the new critical behavior. In contrast to Eq. ([\ref=UniversalE]), the universal part of E is now

[formula]

Similar calculations are possible for perturbations of g away from criticality with λ held fixed. If one sets g  =  gc  -  Γ and λ  =  λc, then in the c = 1 region one finds that the singularity of E is ~    -  Γ2  /   log Γ. For λ  =  λt, E  ~  Γ2 log Γ instead.

The branched polymer region

It is clear from Fig. ([\ref=Waterfall]) that the region above the curve given by Eq. ([\ref=glCurve]) with μF  =  μc, but below the critical curve, is covered not once but twice by the family of curves in Eq. ([\ref=glCurve]). Given (λ,g) in this region, there are thus two values of μF and c that satisfy the self-consistent field equations Eq. ([\ref=Permit]). The true ground state of H corresponds to the solution with the lower energy E. It is an unsurprising but slightly non-trivial fact that the solution with lower E is the one with lower μF. At any given point in Fig. ([\ref=Waterfall]) where two curves cross each other, the more down-sloping curve is the one with lower μF, and thus represents the ground state.

Let us fix g and consider how λ varies with μF. The singularity of the perturbation theory in λ occurs at the maximum of λ(μF). For any g, λ(0) = 0. The behavior of λ with increasing μF, however, depends on the value of g.

For g  <  gt, λ is an increasing function of μF and the maximum occurs at the end-point μF  =  μc. The slope diverges logarithmically as μF approaches μc, which leads to the c = 1 critical behavior. For g = gt, λ is an increasing function of μF with a slope that is finite everywhere. The finiteness of the slope at μF  =  μc leads to the modified critical behavior.

For g  >  gt, λ(μF) increases to a quadratic maximum at a value of μF less than μc. This maximum corresponds to λ reaching the critical curve: λ(μm) = λc. If we increase μF past μm, λ(μF) decreases; this region represents only unphysical solutions to the self-consistent field equations. In other words, if for a given value of λ there are two possible values of μF, then we pick the smaller one because it is analytically connected to the perturbative region near λ = 0. A graph of λ(μF) with [formula] is shown in Fig. ([\ref=LamVsMu]).

The main point is that we can perturb λ away from its critical value λc by lowering μF: if we write λ  =  λc  -  Δ and μF  =  μm  -  μ, then

[formula]

where a > 0 is some constant.

From Eq. ([\ref=SimpleE]) and Eq. ([\ref=QuadraticD]) it is simple to show that

[formula]

K / I7 / 3 always has positive derivative, so the universal behavior of E is

[formula]

where α is a positive number. Predictably, the same power law occurs in the universal part of E when we perturb g  =  gc  -  Γ with λ fixed at λc: the leading nonanalytic behavior of E is ~    -  Γ3 / 2.

It is remarkable that as soon as gc exceeds gt, the Fermi level μF starts falling. Since the universal behavior of the c = 1 model is driven by the Fermi energy approaching criticality, we regard the dropping of the Fermi energy as the reason for the transition to the branched polymer phase.

Discussion

By performing the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. ([\ref=NewE]) we find that, for g = gt, the sum over connected genus zero surfaces of area A is

[formula]

This is precisely the KPZ scaling [\cite=KPZ] with γstr = 0. For the conventional c = 1 matrix model we instead have [\cite=GK]

[formula]

Thus, the critical behavior we have found is actually simpler than the conventional c = 1 behavior. Is it possible that we have penetrated the c = 1 barrier, as suggested in ref. [\cite=abc]? Although we do not have a definite answer, it seems likely to us that the new critical point can be described by two-dimensional string theory. The scaling violations for c = 1 have been attributed [\cite=JP] to the unusual dependence of the tachyon potential on the Liouville field, T(φ)  ~  φeφ. It appears that, if the tachyon potential has the ordinary Liouville form, T(φ)  ~  eφ, then the simpler scaling of Eq. ([\ref=simps]) follows. Clearly, more work is needed to settle the stringy interpretation of our new critical theory.

We believe that there are more interesting calculations that can be performed in the modified c = 1 matrix model. Such calculations should shed light on the critical behavior for higher genus surfaces and, ultimately, on the double-scaling limit.

Note added

After this paper was completed, we learned of an interesting paper by F. Sugino and O. Tsuchiya [\cite=Sugino] in which results similar to ours were obtained by means of collective field theory.

The family of curves representing all possible solutions (λ,g) to the self-consistent field equations. Each curve has constant Fermi energy μF. The critical curve is the outer envelope of all these curves. The transition point from the c = 1 region to the branched polymer region is [formula], where curves with different μF start crossing one another. When two curves do cross, the one with the lower μF (or, equivalently, more negative slope) represents the physical ground state. Thus, for each curve, only the part to the right of the contact with the envelope is physical.
