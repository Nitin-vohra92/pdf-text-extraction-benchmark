Abstract

The effects of the nearest neighbour Coulomb repulsion, V, are considered in the one dimensional copper-oxide chain using the modified Lanczos method. Above a critical value of V we find that charge transfer excitons are the lowest lying energy exitations in the insulating phase. Close to the metal-insulator transition and V = 0 there is good 'particle-hole' symmetry, showing that the mapping from a two band model to a one band model is appropriate. The effect of the nearest neighbour repulsion is to create states in the gap and to pin the Fermi level upon hole doping.

There are many features of the high temperature superconductors which cannot be explained within a one band Hubbard model. Two examples of these are: first, the excitonic excitations observed recently by Raman spectroscopy [\cite=lue93] and second, the pinning of the Fermi level as a function of doping, which has long been an outstanding problem presented by photoemission spectroscopy [\cite=Allen90] [\cite=Anderson93]. It is the purpose of this letter to show that both of these phenomena occur as a natural consequence of the Coulomb repulsion between copper and oxygen orbitals. To demonstrate this we solve exactly finite size chains via the Lanczos method. We also provide physical arguments to support these calculations.

Our model for the copper-oxide chain consists of two atoms per unit cell. Neglecting the oxygen-oxygen hybridization and considering the Coulomb interaction up to first-nearest neighbours, the copper-oxide chain is described by the two band model Hamiltonian,

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

i and j are copper and oxygen sites respectively, < ij >  represents nearest neighbours and the operator [formula] creates a Cu (O) hole with spin σ. Δ is the charge-transfer energy, Ud (Up) is the copper (oxygen) Coulomb repulsion, Ns is the number of sites, Np is the number of particles, and V and t are the copper-oxide Coulomb repulsion and hybridization, respectively. The Hamiltonian has been defined so that it is invariant under the 'particle-hole transformation' [formula], [formula] and Δ  →  Ud - (Δ + Up), i.e. E(Np,Δ)= E(2Ns - Np,Ud - (Δ + Up)).

In the non-interacting limit the Hamiltonian can be solved exactly. Two bands are formed with a charge transfer gap between them, [formula] The diagonalised eigenfunctions corresponding to the lower and upper bands are [formula] and [formula], respectively where [formula] and [formula]. In the strong coupling limit, Up,Ud  →    ∞  , the spin label becomes redundant and the Hamiltonian maps onto a spinless Fermion model [\cite=emery90]. When V = 0, the eigenfunctions are as before, except that there is no spin index. Consequently, kf  →  2kf and the system is Mott insulating for one hole per unit cell.

When the infinite U limit is relaxed the spin degeneracy is lifted by the superexchange interaction. There is spin and charge separation with the spin excitations described by a 'squeezed' Heisenberg chain and the charge excitations by a Slater determinant of spinless fermions.

In this letter we consider parameters which are more relevant to the high temperature superconductors. Thus we take [formula], [formula] and Up small, where [formula]. However, as we are interested in the role played by the nearest neighbour interaction, V, this will be left as a free parameter.

Firstly we examine the model in the insulating phase at a hole density of n = 0.5. At this density the system is a charge transfer insulator for all [formula], and the ground state is a spin density wave. The majority of the charge resides on the copper sites, forming a Néel state with a momentum of k = π (a wavelength of two unit cells).

As V is increased there is a change in the character of the low lying energy excitations in the charge transfer gap, being particle-hole for small V and excitonic like above V  ~  1.5t. The exciton is identified as the lowest frequency peak, Ee, of the dynamical current-current correlation function, J(w), when it appears inside the charge transfer gap, Eg. J(w) is defined by

[formula]

where

[formula]

GR(w) is the retarded Green function and j is the current operator defined as [formula]. {|ψ0 > ,E0} are the ground state eigensolutions. In practice we choose a finite value of η to broaden the peaks. The Green function is calculated via the continued fraction [\cite=Gag89],

[formula]

To find the coefficients [formula] we use a Lanczos type algorithm as follows.

[formula]

[formula]

Figure 1 is a typical profile of J(w). The inset shows how the energies Ee and Eg evolve as V is increased, and also the cross-over point which occurs at around [formula]. The exciton may be pictured as a hole that has been excited from the lower Hubbard band (or valence band), which is predominately copper in character, to the conduction band, which is predominately oxygen in character. The real space picture is therefore of a hole on a copper site hopping onto a neighbouring oxygen site. This effectively leaves an 'electron' on the copper site and a hole on the oxygen site and due to the Coulomb repulsion between neighbouring sites this leads to an effective attraction between the electron and the hole. This attraction reduces the energy to a point below the charge transfer gap and causes the formation of a tightly bound 'electron-hole' pair, also known as a Frenkel exciton. The energy in forming the exciton is a balance between the Coulomb attraction of the 'electron-hole' pair and the kinetic energy loss. The former is driven by V, whereas the latter is determined by t. Hence, when V is of the order of t we expect excitons to exist within the charge transfer gap. The existence of excitons in this model is an encouraging sign that the nearest neighbour Coulomb repulsion may play an important role in the insulating cuprates. Recent Raman scattering experiments by Liu et al. [\cite=lue93] indicate the existence of excitons in these materials. Their experiments were carried out on a variety of cuprates in the insulating state. They showed that these materials have a complex collection of excitonic states. Two possible explanations they give for this are either, an intra-atomic transition dx2 - y2  →  dxy, or an inter-atomic transition of the kind dx2 - y2  →  pxy. We appear to observe the latter. It would be interesting to know what role, if any, these charge transfer excitons may have within the conducting region, and whether they could be a possible mechanism for superconductivity.

We now consider the effect of the Coulomb repulsion V on the photoemission spectra. For finite Ud, but keeping Up,V = 0, studies of the transfer of spectral weight reveal that at low doping there is a good symmetry between the strongly correlated copper sites and the 'free' electron sites of oxygen. The transfer of spectral weight is calculated from the single particle Green function. This is defined in the same way as equation (2), but with [formula] replaced by [formula]; the spectral function is then given by [formula]. Again, it is evaluated using the modified Lanczos procedure. Figure 2 shows the spectral function for 6 holes on a 12 site chain with V = 0. The lower Hubbard band, upper Hubbard band and the 'oxygen' conduction band are clearly evident. The values of the parameters are choosen to fit, as far as possible, with photoemission data, which suggests Ud  ~  8t - 9t,Δ  ~  2t - 3t and Up small [\cite=Tun91].

The transfer of spectral weight is a measure of the strength of the correlations as the hole density is varied. It is defined by [formula], where egap is the energy of the nearest gap to the Fermi surface. Figure 3 shows ST for a 12 site chain with V = 0. For highly correlated systems the transfer of spectral weight goes as roughly twice the doping fraction, as weight is transfered from both the upper and the lower Hubbard bands to form new states at the Fermi level [\cite=esk91]. It might seem suprising, therefore, to find that doping into the conduction band with holes is symmetric with respect to doping into the lower Hubbard band with electrons. However, the cuprates cannot be described as normal semiconductors because of the strong hybridization between copper and oxygen sites. Near to the metal-insulator transition the Zhang-Rice picture of an oxygen spin bound to a copper spin as a singlet is appropriate [\cite=Zhang88]. This picture naturally leads to a mapping from a two band model to a one band model, which is exact in the limit Ud  -  Δ <  < Ud and small doping [\cite=Barford90]. Further from the metal-insulator transition, however, correlation effects are screened by the added oxygen holes, the Zhang-Rice singlet breaks down and the transfer of spectral weight becomes similar to that expected of a doped semiconductor. This effect can be interpreted in figure 3, where one can see a reduction in the gradient of the line as the hole density approaches half filling (n = 1).

A large value of the nearest neighbour Coulomb interaction has the effect of destroying the charge transfer gap on doping, so a comparison with the transfer of spectral weight is impossible. However, for small V there is very little change from the curve in figure 3, so it has not been shown. Turning on the nearest neighbour interaction has one very important effect, however. Experimental work on samples of hole doped La2 - xSrxCuO4 - y [\cite=Allen90] [\cite=Anderson93] has shown that there is a significant increase in spectral weight within the charge transfer gap on hole doping. The Fermi energy, ef, has essentially the same position in the gap for both the stochiometric and doped samples. These states must arise by a transfer of spectral weight from both the conduction and valence band states of the insulator. A similar effect is observed in our calculations on the extended Hubbard model. For V = 0 hole doping shifts the Fermi energy from the middle of the charge transfer gap into the conducting band. For V  ≠  0, however, the effect of doping with holes is to form new states in the charge transfer gap, resulting in the pinning of ef. Figure 4 shows the spectral weight for 8 holes on the 12 site chain with Ud = 8t, Up = 0, Δ = 2t and V = 2.5t. The new states which have formed within the charge transfer gap are clearly evident. Figure 5 is a plot of 2ef / Eg versus density n for the values of V = 0, t and 2.5t for 0.5 < n < 1.0, from which it is clear that the increase in ef on hole doping decreases as V is increased, and at V = 2.5t there is actually a reduction in ef between [formula] and n = 1.

The creation of new states in the gap and the pinning of ef can be thought of in the following manner. When V = 0 the doping of holes onto oxygen sites has no effect on the charge transfer gap, nor on the occupancy of the copper sites. When V > 0, however, the doping of holes onto oxygen sites has the effect of pushing holes off copper sites onto vacant oxygen sites. This has two consequences. First, the nearest neighbour repulsion experienced by an oxygen hole decreases because the amount of copper charge has been reduced. Hence the effective charge transfer gap shrinks. Second, new particle removal states are formed which are oxygen in character. These result from the copper holes which have been pushed onto oxygen sites. The consequence of this is that new particle addition states are formed which are copper in character. This admixture of the hole addition and removal states is responsible for the new states in the gap. The pinning of the Fermi energy due to the nearest neighbour repulsion also indicates a tendency towards phase separation [\cite=Barford93] [\cite=Vermeulen94]. The fact that pinning of ef is observed is further encouraging evidence that the nearest neighbour repulsion may play an important role in cuprate electron structure.

In conclusion, we have shown that the nearest neighbour repulsion leads to low lying excitons in the charge transfer gap at values of V > 1.5t. There is evidence from recent Raman spectroscopy that these excitons are indeed present in cuprate insulators. At V = 0 there is good symmetry between doping into the oxygen conduction band with holes, and doping into the copper valence band with electrons. This indicates there are strong correlations within the oxygen band and that the Zhang-Rice singlet is energetically favourable. At finite values of the nearest neighbour repulsion doping with holes causes new states to form in the charge transfer gap and results in the pinning of the Fermi energy, as observed by photoemission spectroscopy.
