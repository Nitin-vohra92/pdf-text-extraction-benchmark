Introduction

Subgroups of abelian groups are abelian and hence self-conjugate or normal. A nonabelian group all of whose subgroups are normal is called hamiltonian [\cite=C56] [\cite=We04h]. Let A denote the class of abelian groups and let H denote the class of hamiltonian groups. In topological graph theory [\cite=GT87] [\cite=Wh01], hamiltonian groups have been studied in the past [\cite=PT89] [\cite=PW88] [\cite=PT89-1]. For several classes of hamiltonian groups the genus is known exactly. For abelian and hamiltonian groups, there are structural theorems available. We note in passing that here we use a different structure theorem. For instance, the cyclic group [formula] can be written as [formula] Since it can be generated by a single generator, the former form is preferred in the topological graph theory over the latter. In this paper we determine the number h(n) of hamiltonian groups of order n and the number b(n) of all groups of order n with the property, that all their subgroups are normal. We also determine the number v(n) of all hamiltonian groups of order ≤  n and the number w(n) of all groups of order ≤  n with the property, that all their subgroups are normal.

Results

Before we study hamiltonian groups we will recall the structure of finite abelian groups [\cite=We04a]. Let π(m) denote a partition of a natural number m, where

[formula]

such that [formula] and mi  ≥  mj for all 1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  s. For [formula] let [formula] and let [formula] denote the direct product of cyclic groups

[formula]

Let G be a finite abelian group of order n. Let us write down the prime decomposition of n as

[formula]

It is well-known that G is isomorphic to the group

[formula]

Let a(n) denote the number of abelian groups of order n and let P(n) denote the number of partitions of the integer n. The previous discussion gives a proof to the following result.

The number a(n) of abelian groups of order n is given by [formula] where [formula] is the prime decomposition of n.

The initial 200 values of the sequence a(n) are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-an].

Note that the sequence [formula] can not contain multiples of primes in the sequence [formula] since [formula], (see [\cite=SloaneA046064]). The number a(n) depends only on the prime signature of n. For example, both 24  =  23  ·  31 and 375  =  31  ·  53 have the prime signature (3,1), therefore a(375)  =  a(24).

A similar structural theorem holds for hamiltonian groups. A hamiltonian group H is isomorphic to a direct product of the quaternion group Q of order 8, an elementary abelian group E of exponent 2 and an abelian group A of odd order

[formula]

where |Q| = 8 = 23, |E| = 2k and |A|  ≠  0  (  2). Therefore |H| = 23 + k|A|. Let n be an arbitrary natural number. We can write n uniquely in the form n  =  2e  ·  o where e  =  e(n)  ≥  0 and o  =  o(n) is an odd number. These results give the number of hamiltonian groups of order n.

Let n  =  2e  ·  o, where e  =  e(n)  ≥  0 and o  =  o(n) is an odd number. The number h(n) of hamiltonian groups of order n is given by

The initial 200 values of the sequence h(n) are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-hn].

Combining abelian and hamiltonian groups of order n we may now give the number b(n): = a(n)  +  h(n) of all groups of order n all of whose subgroups are normal. The initial 300 values of the sequence b(n) are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-bn].

The number u(n) of all abelian groups of order ≤  n is presented in [\cite=SloaneA063966]. The initial 100 values of the sequence u(n) are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-un].

Let v(n) be the number of all hamiltonian groups of order ≤  n and let w(n) be the number of all groups of order ≤  n all of whose subgroups are normal. The initial 200 values of the sequences v(n) and w(n) are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-vn] and Table [\ref=table-initvalues-wn], respectively.

If we look at the sequences [formula] and [formula] from the inverse perspective, we can define two more sequences. Let Sa(n) denote the smallest number [formula], for which exactly n nonisomorphic abelian groups of order k exist ([\cite=SloaneA046056]). The first 60 elements of the sequence [formula] are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-san]. Here 0 denotes the case, where Sa(n) does not exist (n is not a product of partition numbers). These indices n are exactly multiples of primes in the sequence s ([\cite=SloaneA046064]).

Let Sh(n) denote the smallest number [formula], for which exactly n nonisomorphic hamiltonian groups of order k exist. The first 30 elements of the sequence [formula] are given in Table [\ref=table-initvalues-shn], where again 0 denotes the case, where n is not a product of partition numbers and Sh(n) does not exist.

Let us finish with two open problems. Think of computing the genus of each of the groups [formula], counted by b(n). Since [formula], the minimal genus is 0. A natural question is therefore to determine

[formula]

The sequence [formula]

Another interesting problem is a generalization of the considered problem, namely, the problem of determining the number of groups, whose every subgroup is 2-subnormal ([\cite=Mah86] [\cite=Sta78]). A subgroup H of group G is said to be 2-subnormal in G if there is a series

[formula]

of subgroups in G (see [\cite=LenSto87]). Such a subgroup is said also to be of defect 2. Similarly, subgroups H of defect 1 in G are precisely normal subgroups of G.
