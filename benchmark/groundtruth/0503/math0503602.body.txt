Multiplicative Monotone Convolutions

Introduction.

In quantum probability there exist several natural notions of independence, see [\cite=muraki03] and the references therein. These allow to define new convolutions for probability measures, cf. [\cite=voiculescu+dykema+nica92] [\cite=voiculescu97] [\cite=speicher+woroudi93] [\cite=muraki00].

Bercovici [\cite=bercovici04] defined multiplicative monotone convolutions for probability measures on the unit circle and on the half line. He showed that with an appropriate function of the Cauchy transform these multiplicative convolutions can be calculated by composition of those functions, similar to Muraki's result [\cite=muraki00] for the additive monotone convolution. In this paper we give a new proof of Bercovici's result based on the combinatorics of moments, see Theorem [\ref=thm-operators]. Using Berkson and Porta's [\cite=berkson+porta78] characterization of composition semigroups, one can deduce a characterization of continuous convolution semigroups for the monotone convolution, see [\cite=bercovici04] or Theorem [\ref=thm-levy-khintchine-circle] for the case of probability measures on the unit circle.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section [\ref=sec-mon] we recall the definition of monotone independence and the monotone product of algebraic and quantum probability spaces. In Section [\ref=sec-mon-cond] we show that the monotone product is actually a special case of the conditionally free product introduced in [\cite=bozejko+speicher91b] [\cite=bozejko+leinert+speicher96].

Sections [\ref=sec-op], [\ref=sec-conv], and [\ref=sec-levy] contain the main results on the multiplicative monotone convolution. We formulate a slightly modified version of a theorem by Bercovici that shows that these convolutions can be calculated by taking the composition of appropriate functions of the Cauchy transform of the measures, see Theorem [\ref=thm-operators] and Corollaries [\ref=cor-unitary] and [\ref=cor-pos]. We also state a Lévy-Khintchine type characterization of all continuous convolution semigroups for the monotone convolution of probability measures on the unit circle, see Theorem [\ref=thm-levy-khintchine-circle].

In Section [\ref=sec-galton], we show that the problem of embedding a probability measure on the unit circle into a continuous monotone convolution semigroup is very similar to the problem of embedding a discrete-time Markovian branching process (or Galton-Watson process) into a continuous-time Markovian branching process. In Section [\ref=sec-embed] we adapt a characterization of embeddable branching processes due to Goryanov [\cite=goryainov93] to our situation.

Finally, in the Appendix we discuss the multiplicative monotone convolution of probability measures on the half line and show that there exist two natural, but inequivalent definitions. One of them is equivalent to the definition due to Bercovici and can be treated by similar methods as the multiplicative monotone convolution of measures on the unit circle., cf. [\cite=bercovici04].

Monotone Independence.

In this section we present the definition of monotone independence and its main properties.

By an algebraic probability space we mean a pair (A,φ) consisting of a unital algebra A and a unital functional [formula]. Assume that we have two algebraic probability spaces (A1,φ1) and (A2,φ2), such that the first algebra has a decomposition [formula] (direct sum as vector spaces), where A01 is a subalgebra of A1. Then we define the algebraic monotone product (A,φ) of (A1,φ1) and (A2,φ2) as follows, see also [\cite=muraki01] [\cite=muraki03]. The algebra [formula] is the free product of A1 and A2 with identification of the units of A1 and A2. The unital functional [formula] is determined by the condition

[formula]

for [formula] and all [formula], [formula].

Let now A1,A2  ⊆  B be two such algebras, which are contained in an algebraic probability space (B,Φ) and denote by j1:A1  →  B, j2:A2  →  B the inclusion maps. Then the universal property of the free product of algebras implies that there exists a unique homomorphism [formula] such that the following diagram commutes

[formula]

where are [formula] and [formula] are the canonical inclusion maps.

The subalgebras A1,A2 are called monotonically independent w.r.t. Φ, if

[formula]

cf. [\cite=franz02]

We will call a triple (A,H,Ω) consisting of a Hilbert space H, a unit vector Ω∈H, and a subalgebra A  ⊆  B(H) a quantum probability space.

If we have an algebraic probability space (A,φ), whose algebra has an involution such that Φ is even a state, and if for all a∈A there exists a constant Ca  ≥  0 such that the inequality

[formula]

holds for all x∈A, then the GNS representation (Hφ,πφ,Ωφ) of (A,Φ) yields a quantum probability space (πφ(A),Hφ,Ωφ). If two subalgebras [formula] are monotonically independent in (A,φ), then πφ(A01) and πφ(A2) are monotonically independent in (πφ(A),Hφ,Ωφ) in the sense of the following definition.

Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω∈H a unit vector, and define a state [formula] on the algebra of bounded operators on H by

[formula]

Two subalgebras A1,A2  ⊆  B(H) are called monotonically independent w.r.t. Ω, if the following two conditions are satisfied.

Two operators X,Y∈B(H) are called monotonically independent w.r.t. Ω, if the subalgebras [formula] and [formula] are monotonically independent.

Let (Ai,Hi,Ωi), i = 1,2, be two quantum probability spaces, and denote the states associated to Ω1 and Ω2 by Φ1 and Φ2, respectively.

Then there exists a quantum probability space (A,H,Ω) and two injective state-preserving homomorphisms Ji:Ai  →  A, i = 1,2, such that the images J1(A1) and J2(A2) are monotonically independent w.r.t. Ω.

We set [formula] and [formula]. Denote by P2 the orthogonal projection on [formula].

We define the embeddings Ji:Ai  →  B(H) by

[formula]

For A we take the subalgebra generated by J1(A1) and J2(A2). It is clear that J1 and J2 are injective, state-preserving homomorphisms.

A simple calculation shows that J1(A1) and J2(A2) are monotonically independent w.r.t. Ω. E.g., for products of the form J1(X1)J2(Y)J1(X2), X1,X2∈A1, Y∈A2, we get

[formula]

On the other hand, for J2(Y1)J1(X)J2(Y2), X∈A1, Y1,Y2∈A2, we get

[formula]

We will call the quantum probability space (A,H,Ω) constructed in the previous proposition the monotone product of (A1,H1,Ω1) and (A2,H2,Ω2). When there is no danger of confusion, we shall identify the algebras A1 and A2 with their images J1(A1) and J2(A2), respectively.

The monotone product is associative and can be extended to more than two factors, see [\cite=franz01]. But it is not commutative.

The embedding J1:A1  →  A is not unital and the product is not trace-preserving. If Φ1|A1 is not identically equal to zero, then the calculation

[formula]

for all X∈A1, Y1,Y2∈A2 shows that Φ can only be a trace on A, if Φ2|A2 is a homomorphism.

Relation of monotone independence and conditional free independence.

We recall now the definition of the conditional free product of algebraic probability spaces and show that the monotone product is contained as a special case.

Let (A1,φ1,ψ1) and (A2,φ2,ψ2) be two unital algebras, equipped with two unital functionals. Recall that the conditionally free product[\cite=bozejko+speicher91b] [\cite=bozejko+leinert+speicher96] of (A1,φ1,ψ1) and (A2,φ2,ψ2) is defined as the triple (A,φ,ψ), where [formula] is the free product of A1 and A2 with identification the units of A1 and A2. The unital functionals φ and ψ on [formula] can be defined by the conditions

[formula]

for all [formula] and all ai∈Aε(i) with ε(i)∈{1,2}, [formula] and [formula]. The functional ψ is simply the free product ψ1  *  ψ2 of ψ1 and ψ2, cf. [\cite=voiculescu+dykema+nica92] [\cite=voiculescu97]. We will denote φ by

[formula]

The product defined in this way for triples (A,φ,ψ) can be shown to be commutative and associative, cf. [\cite=bozejko+speicher91b] [\cite=bozejko+leinert+speicher96].

Taking pairs of the form (A1,φ1,φ1) and (A2,φ2,φ2), one obtains the free product also for the first functional, i.e.

[formula]

Suppose now that the algebras A1 and A2 have decompositions [formula], i = 1,2, as a direct sum of vector spaces, such that the A0i are even subalgebras. If one defines functionals [formula] by

[formula]

for [formula], a0∈A0i, i = 1,2, then one obtains the boolean product

[formula]

cf. [\cite=speicher+woroudi93] [\cite=bozejko+leinert+speicher96].

Since the conditionally free product of triples of the form (A,φ,δ) can be shown to be again of the same form, the commutativity and associativity of the boolean product follow immediately from this construction.

One can also obtain the monotone product from the conditionally free product.

Let (A1,φ1) and (A2,φ2) be two algebraic quantum probability spaces and assume A1 has a decomposition [formula], where A01 is a subalgebra of A1. Define a unital functional [formula] as in Equation ([\ref=delta]).

Then we have

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula] such that [formula], and [formula] such that δ1(ak) = 0 if ε(k) = 1 and φ2(ak) = 0 if ε(k) = 2. This implies ak∈A01 for ε(k) = 1 and therefore by Equation ([\ref=def-alg-mon])

[formula]

(If the product [formula] does not begin or end with an element of A2, add [formula] in order to apply Equation ([\ref=def-alg-mon])).

Therefore [formula] satisfies condition ([\ref=def-cond-free]) that defines the conditionally free product [formula].

With this observation, Muraki's formula [\cite=muraki00] for the additive monotone convolution can be deduced from the analytic theory of the additive conditionally free convolution developed in [\cite=bozejko+leinert+speicher96].

Products of monotonically independent operators.

For a bounded operator X in a quantum probability space (B(H),H,Ω) we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

for |z| < 1 / ||X||.

The following theorem is similar to [\cite=bercovici04]. Below we provide a new proof.

Let (B(H),H,Ω) be a quantum probability space and A1,A2  ⊆  B(H) two monotonically independent subalgebras. Let [formula], such that [formula] and W∈A2. Then we have

[formula]

for all |z| <  min (1 / ||V1WV2||,1 / ||W||).

Let [formula] and |z| < 1 / M. Then we have

[formula]

where [formula].

Using properties (a) and (b) in Definition [\ref=def-mon-indep], we get

[formula]

By uniqueness of analytic continuation, we get

[formula]

for all |z| <  min (1 / ||V1WV2||,1 / ||W||).

Let U,V be two unitary operators such that [formula] and V are monotonically independent with respect to Ω. Then we have

[formula]

for all [formula].

Let X,Y be two positive operators such that [formula] and Y are monotonically independent with respect to Ω. Then we have

[formula]

for all [formula].

Multiplicative monotone convolution for probability measures on the unit circle.

For a probability measure μ on S1 we define

[formula]

for [formula].

We will call Kμ the K-transform of μ, it characterizes the measure μ completely. Furthermore, for a holomorphic function [formula] there exists a probability measure μ on the unit circle S1 such that K = Kμ if and only if K(0) = 0. This follows from the Herglotz representation theorem, the proof is similar to [\cite=franz04].

It is clear that the composition of two K-transforms is again a K-transform of some probability measure on the unit circle. In view of Corollary [\ref=cor-unitary] this suggests the following definition.

Let μ,ν be two probability measures on S1, with transforms Kμ and Kν. Then the unique probability measure [formula] on S1 with

[formula]

is called the monotone convolution of μ and ν.

The monotone convolution is weakly continuous.

The monotone convolution is associative, i.e.

[formula]

for all λ,μ,ν, but not commutative, i.e., in general [formula].

The Dirac measure δ1 at 1 is a two-sided unit, [formula] for all μ. Right convolution by a Dirac measure δx acts as translation, i.e. [formula], where Tx:S1  →  S1 is defined by Tx(y) = xy for x∈S1. But [formula] in general.

The monotone convolution is affine in the first argument. Together with weak continuity this implies the following formula

[formula]

Lévy-Khintchine formula for monotone convolution semigroups.

We call a weakly continuous one-parameter family [formula] of probability measures on the unit circle a continuous monotone convolution semigroup, if

[formula]

for all s,t  ≥  0. By definition a one-parameter family (μt)t  ≥ is a continuous monotone convolution semigroup if and only if the K-transforms Kt = Kμt, t  ≥  0 form a continuous semigroup w.r.t. to composition. The continuity of the K-transforms is uniform in z on compact sets. Our main tool for characterizing continuous monotone convolution semigroups will be Berkson and Porta's [\cite=berkson+porta78] characterisation of composition semigroups of holomorphic maps.

[\cite=bercovici04] Let (μt)t  ≥  0 be a weakly continuous family of probability measures on the unit circle, with K-transforms (Kt)t  ≥  0. Then the following are equivalent.

for [formula] and t  ≥  0, with initial condition K0(z) = z.

The equivalence between (a) and (b) follows from the definition and the continuity properties of the monotone convolution.

The equivalence between (b) and (c) is an immediate consequence of [\cite=berkson+porta78], it suffices to identify the fixed point at zero as the Denjoy-Wolff point of the Kt.

The function u in (c) can be computed from the derivative of (Kt)t  ≥  0 in t = 0 by

[formula]

we will call it the generator of (Kt)t  ≥  0.

Such a function u has a unique Herglotz representation

[formula]

where b is a real number and ρ a finite measure on S1.

Relation to Galton-Watson processes.

A probability measure μ on the unit circle is called infinitely divisible w.r.t. to the monotone convolution, if for all [formula] there exists a probability measure μn on the unit circle such that

[formula]

Bercovici has shown in [\cite=bercovici04] that all infinitely divisible probability measures can be embedded into a continuous monotone convolution semigroup, i.e. if μ is infinitely divisible w.r.t. to the monotone convolution, then there exists a continuous monotone convolution semigroup (μt)t  ≥  0 such that μ  =  μt for some [formula]. And from the previous section it is clear this implies that the K-transform Kμ can be embedded into a continuous composition semigroup of K-transforms.

A similar problem has been studied in the theory of Galton-Watson processes.

Let Xn,k, [formula] be independent, identically distributed random variables with values in [formula] with generating function

[formula]

where [formula]. Then the associated Galton-Watson process (Yn)n  ≥  0 is defined by Y0 = 1, and

[formula]

This process describes the evolution of a population where after each step each individual produces a random number of offspring according to the probabilities (pm)m  ≥  0.

Its generating functions form a discrete composition semigroup,

[formula]

If [formula] (i.e. no individual dies without offspring), then φ(0) = 0 and φ is the K-transform of a probability measure μ on S1. If (Yn)n  ≥  0 can be embedded into a continuous-time Markovian branching process (or equivalently, if (φn)n  ≥  0 can be embedded into a continuous composition semigroup [formula] of generating functions), then μ is infinitely divisible for the monotone convolution and can be embedded into a continuous monotone convolution semigroup. The problem of embedding Galton-Watson processes has been studied by Goryanov[\cite=goryainov93] [\cite=goryainov00].

Continuous-time Markovian branching processes with extinction probability 0 can be obtained by choosing infinitesimal offspring probabilities λj  ≥  0 for j  ≥  2 such that [formula], setting

[formula]

and solving the differential equation

[formula]

with initial condition φ0(z) = z, cf. [\cite=goryainov93].

A simple example is the Yule process, where v(z) = α(zk - z) and

[formula]

for some [formula], k  ≥  2. This process describes a population were the individuals are replaced by k new individuals after an exponentially distributed random time.

On the embedding of probability measures into continuous monotone convolution semigroups.

[\cite=goryainov93] and [\cite=goryainov93] characterize probability generating functions that can be embedded into composition semigroups of probability generating functions. In this section we give a similar characterization for K-transforms of probability measures on the unit circle that can be embedded into continuous monotone convolution semigroups.

Let (Kt)t  ≥  0 be a continuous composition semigroups of K-transforms. By [\cite=berkson+porta78], Kt is differentiable w.r.t. t and satisfies the differential equation

[formula]

for t  ≥  0, [formula], with v given by

[formula]

This equation follows from the semigroup property [formula] by differentiation w.r.t. s at s = 0.

By Theorem [\ref=thm-levy-khintchine-circle], the function v is of the form v(z) =  - zu(z), with a holomorphic function [formula] such that [formula] for [formula].

We will need the following lemma.

Let [formula], [formula], be a holomorphic function such that [formula] for [formula] and set β = u(0), v(z) =  - zu(z) for [formula].

Then, for all t  ≥  0, the equation

[formula]

has a unique solution f with f'(0) = e- tβ.

The proof of this lemma is borrowed from [\cite=goryainov93].

Let (Kt)t  ≥  0 be a composition semigroup of K-transforms with generator u. Then all Kt, t  ≥  0 satisfy Equation ([\ref=eq-5]). Furthermore, the differential equation that the Kt satisfy, implies

[formula]

and therefore K't(0) = e- tβ, since K0(z) = z and K'0(0) = 1. This proves existence.

Let now f be an arbitrary solution of Equation ([\ref=eq-5]) with f'(0) = e- tβ. Since v has no zeros inside [formula] other than z = 0, we get f(0) = 0 by substituting z = 0 into Equation ([\ref=eq-5]). Differentiation Equation ([\ref=eq-5]) k times, we can calculate the higher derivatives of f at zero from f'(0) = e- tβ and the derivatives of v at zero. This proves uniqueness.

Let [formula] be the K-transforms of a continuous monotone convolution semigroup (μt)t  ≥  0 with generator u. Then K't(0) = e- tu(0) is the first moment of μt, i.e.

[formula]

We come to the main result of this section.

Let μ be a probability measure on the unit circle S1 that is not concentrated in one point.

Then μ can be embedded into a continuous monotone convolution semigroup if and only if [formula] for all [formula] and there exists a locally uniform limit

[formula]

in [formula] that is of the form v(z) = αzu(z) with a non-zero constant [formula] and a holomorphic function [formula] such that [formula] for [formula] and K'μ(0) = e- t0u(0) for some some t0  ≥  0.

The proof of this theorem is similar to that of [\cite=goryainov93].

Suppose that μ can be embedded into a continuous monotone convolution semigroup. Then Kμ can be embedded into a composition semigroup of K-transforms (Kt)t  ≥  0. Therefore all Kt are injective and [formula] for all [formula], [formula], cf. [\cite=berkson+porta78]. Denote by u the generator of (Kt)t  ≥  0 and define v by v(z) =  - zu(z) for [formula]. By the Denjoy-Wolff theorem we get lim t  →    ∞Kt(z) = 0 and lim t  →    ∞K't(z) = 0 locally uniformly for all [formula]. Therefore

[formula]

With the right-hand-side of Equation ([\ref=eq-4]) this implies

[formula]

The limit is of the form required in the theorem with the constant α =  - 1 / u(0).

To show the converse, let now Kμ be a K-transform satisfying the conditions of the theorem with v(z) = αzu(z), α and u as described in the theorem.

Let (Kt)t  ≥  0 be the composition semigroup of K-transforms with generator u. Then the Kt satisfy

[formula]

The conditions of the theorem imply that Kμ is also a solution of the same equation,

[formula]

The uniqueness in Lemma [\ref=lemma-unique] now implies Kμ = Kt0.

Let μ  =  δx be concentrated in one point x = eiφ∈S1. Then we get [formula] and Kμ(z) = eiφz and μ can be embedded into the continuous convolution semigroups (μ(k)t)t  ≥  0 given by μ(k)t  =  δeit(φ + 2πk), [formula].

Appendix: Multiplicative monotone convolution for probability measures on [formula].

Just as there are many different ways to define multiplicatively a positive operator from two given positive operators, there are different definitions of multiplicative monotone convolutions of two probability measures μ and ν on [formula]. Two possible choices are to take positive self-adjoint operators X and Y, whose distributions are given by μ and ν, resp., such that [formula] and [formula] are monotonically independent, and to define the convolution of μ and ν as the distributions of [formula] or [formula].

By Corollary [\ref=cor-pos] the K-transform of [formula] is equal to the composition of the K-transforms of X and Y. Therefore this gives a definition which is equivalent to the one chosen by Bercovici, cf. [\cite=bercovici04].

We will show below that choosing the distribution of [formula] as the convolution of the distributions of X and Y leads to an inequivalent definition.

The operators [formula] and [formula] have the same spectrum, except for 0. More precisely, [formula], since [formula] and [formula] with [formula] and [formula].

But the following example shows that, unlike in the free case where one works with tracial states, here the distributions of [formula] and [formula] are in general different and therefore we have two different multiplicative monotone convolutions for probability measures on [formula].

Consider the positive definite 2  ×  2-matrix

[formula]

with a∈(0,1). Then we have

[formula]

for [formula], i.e. the distribution of A in the vector state given by [formula] is equal to [formula].

A simple calculation yields

[formula]

Let a,b∈(0,1) and consider the pair of positive definite matrices

[formula]

in [formula] where Pω denotes the orthogonal projection onto [formula]. With respect to the vector state given by [formula], [formula] and [formula] are monotonically independent, with distributions given by [formula] and [formula], respectively.

As in Equation ([\ref=sqrt]), we compute

[formula]

The eigenvalues of both [formula] and [formula] are

[formula]

and therefore their distributions have the same support. But their distributions in the vector state [formula] are different. For example their second moments differ,

[formula]

(recall that we assumed [formula], [formula]).
