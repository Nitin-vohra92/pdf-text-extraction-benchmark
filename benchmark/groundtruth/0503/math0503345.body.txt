Some binomial series obtained by the WZ-method

The WZ-method

We recall [\cite=zeilberger2] that a discrete function A(n,k) is hypergeometric or closed form (CF) if the quotients

[formula]

are both rational functions.

And a pair of functions F(n,k), G(n,k) is said to be of Wilf and Zeilberger (WZ) if F and G are closed forms and besides

[formula]

In this case H. S. Wilf and D. Zeilberger [\cite=zeilberger1] have proved that there exists a rational function C(n,k) such that

[formula]

The rational function C(n,k) is the so-called certificate of the pair (F,G).

We now define

[formula]

Zeilberger has proved that for every WZ pair F(n,k), G(n,k) the following holds:

[formula]

In next sections we use WZ-pairs to get some Ramanujan's formulae and also some new Ramanujan-like ones.

First WZ-pair

We consider the following discrete function:

[formula]

The package EKHAD [\cite=petkovsek] allows to obtain the companion

[formula]

We derive the result

[formula]

We can extend the pair to have sense for every value of k, not only integers, in the following way:

[formula]

If k is an integer, it is a routine to prove that

[formula]

and this implies applying Carlson's theorem [\cite=bailey] that for every value of k, even if k is not an integer, [formula], where A is a constant. To determine the value of the constant, observe that

[formula]

And we have that, independently of the value of k,

[formula]

But then we have also the sum of another family of infinite series because obviously we immediately get

[formula]

For k = 0, we get the following results [\cite=ramanujan]:

[formula]

For other values of k we obtain also interesting results. For example, for k = 1 / 4 we get

[formula]

Second WZ-pair
