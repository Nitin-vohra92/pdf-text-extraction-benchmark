Introduction

All maps considered in our paper are continuous and all spaces are assumed to be at least completely regular. Everywhere below Πk  ⊂  m denotes a k-dimensional, not necessarily coordinate, plane (simply, a k-plane) in m. Moreover, if Πt and ΠT are two coordinate planes with t  ≤  T, we write Πt  ⊂  ΠT if Πt is a linear subspace of ΠT. If not explicitely stated otherwise, all function spaces in the paper are equipped with the source limitation topology.

Our goal is to prove Theorem 1.1 below and provide some applications of this theorem.

Let [formula], i = 1,2,...,q and [formula], be points in m such that the set of their coordinates is algebraically independent. Suppose 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m and Πd is a d-plane in m parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT  ⊂  m. If either d - t + 1  ≤  q and [formula] or q  ≤  d - t + 1 and [formula], then there exists i∈{1,2,...,q} such that Πd doesn't meet the linear hull Π(Mi) of the set [formula].

The first part of Theorem 1.1, when t = 0, T = m and d - t + 1  ≤  q, was stated as a conjecture in [\cite=b2] and [\cite=b4].

Recall that a real number v is called algebraically dependent on the real numbers u1,...,uk if v satisfies the equation p0(u) + p1(u)v + ... + pn(u)vn = 0, where p0(u),...,pn(u) are polynomials in u1,...,uk with rational coefficients, not all of them 0. A finite set of real numbers is algebraically independent if none of them depends algebraically on the others.

Let K be a finite simplicial complex, θ:K  →  m a semi-linear map and ε > 0. Then there is a semi-linear map g:K  →  m such that d(g(v),θ(v)) < ε for each vertex v of K, and for any integers n,d,t,T with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  m - n - 1 and d  ≤  T  ≤  m, and any d-plane Πd  ⊂  m parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT  ⊂  m, the number q of pairwise disjoint simplexes of K of dimension ≤  n whose images under g intersect Πd satisfies the inequalities: [formula] if n  ≥  (m - n - T)(d - t) and [formula] if n  ≤  (m - n - T)(d - t).

The idea to use algebraically independent sets for proving general position theorems, like Corollary 1.2, was originated by Roberts in [\cite=r]. This idea was also applied by Berkowitz and Roy in [\cite=br] where they stated a version of Corollary 1.2 with t = 0 and T = m. A proof of the Berkowitz-Roy theorem was provided by Goodsell in [\cite=g2] (see also [\cite=g1] for another application of the Berkowitz-Roy theorem).

Here are some applications of Corollary 1.2.

Let f:X  →  Y be a perfect map between paracompact spaces such that dim f  ≤  n and dim Y = 0. Then, for every m  ≥  n + 1, C*(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset H of maps g such that [formula] for every y∈Y and every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - n  ≤  d  ≤  m.

Let X be a normal space with dim X = n and m  ≥  n + 1. Then C*(X,m) equipped with the uniform convergence topology contains a dense Gδ-subset H consisting of maps g such that [formula] is at most (n + d - m)-dimensional for every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - n  ≤  d  ≤  m.

Let show how Corollary 1.4 follows from Theorem 1.3. Considering the ech-Stone compactification βX of X and the function space C(βX,m) instead, respectively, of X and C*(X,m), we can suppose that X is compact. Then take f to be a constant map on X and apply Theorem 1.3.

Roberts proved in [\cite=r] that if X is a compact metrizable space of dimension ≤  n and n + 1  ≤  d  ≤  2n + 1, then C(X,2n + 1) with the uniform convergence topology contains a dense Gδ-subset consisting of maps g such that [formula] for every d-plane Πd  ⊂  2n + 1. Using this result and the Hurewicz theorem about metrizable compactifications preserving dimension, Roberts derived the existence of such embeddings for separable metrizable spaces of dimension ≤  n. Obviously, this results of Roberts follow from the combination of Corollary 1.4 and the Nöbeling-Pontryagin embedding theorem.

When d  ≤  m - n - 1, Theorem 1.3 doesn't work. But next theorem shows that, in this case, we can prove something more, we can find a residual subset of C*(X,m) consisting of maps g such that [formula] is finite for any y∈Y and any d-plane in m.

Suppose f:X  →  Y is a perfect map between metrizable spaces with dim f  ≤  n and dim Y  ≤  0. Then, C*(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset K of maps g such that, for any integers d,t,T with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m and d  ≤  m - n - 1 and any d-plane Πd  ⊂  m parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT  ⊂  m, each set [formula], y∈Y, has at most q points, where [formula] if n  ≥  (m - n - T)(d - t) and [formula] otherwise.

Taking Y in Theorem 1.5 to be a point, m = n + 2, d = 1, t = 0 and T = r we obtain next corollary.

Let X be a metrizable compactum with dim X  ≤  n. Then, C(X,n + 2) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps g such that for any natural integer r with r  ≤  n + 2 and any line Π1  ⊂  n + 2 parallel to some coordinate plane Πr in n + 2, the inverse image g- 1(Π1) has at most n + r points.

Theorem 1.5 together with [\cite=w] implies the following interesting fact: If X is an n-dimensional metrizable compactum with n  ≥  3 and m  ≥  2n + 1, then almost every embedding of X in m is tame.

Theorem 1.7 below is an infinite-dimensional version of Theorem 1.5. For compact X and Y -- a point, Theorem 1.7 was established by Boltyanski [\cite=b] under the additional restriction that r = 0.

Let f:X  →  Y be a perfect map between metrizable spaces with Y being a C-space. For any integers d,r let P(d,r) denote the family of all d-planes Πd  ⊂  l2 parallel to some coordinate plane Πr  ⊂  l2. Then, C*(X,l2) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps g such that, for every y∈Y, and every Πd∈P(d,r), [formula] has at most [formula] points if r  ≤  d and at most one point if r  ≥  d.

The paper is organized as follows. The proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2 are given in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.3. Theorems 1.5 and 1.7 are established in Section 4. The final Section 5 contains more applications of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2. Some conjectures are also included in the final section.

A few words about the source limitation topology. For any spaces M and K by C(K,M) we denote the set of all continuous maps from K into M. If (M,d) is a metric space and K is any space, then the source limitation topology on C(K,M) is defined in the following way: a subset U  ⊂  C(K,M) is open in C(K,M) with respect to the source limitation topology provided for every g∈U there exists a continuous function α:K  →  (0,  ∞  ) such that [formula]. Here, [formula] denotes the set [formula]. It is well known (see, for example [\cite=jm:75]) that if (M,d) is a complete metric space, C(K,M) with this topology has Baire property. This implies that C*(K,H) with the source limitation topology also possesses the Baire property for any Banach space H.

In conclusion of the introduction, we wish to thank Prof. T. Goodsell who provided us with his proof [\cite=g2]of the Berkowitz-Roy theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Suppose Πd meets the linear hull Π(Mi) of each set Mi and let [formula], i = 1,...,q. It suffices to show that, under this assumption, we have either [formula] provided q  ≥  d - t + 1 or [formula] provided 1  ≤  q  ≤  d - t + 1. To this end, the following proposition below (see [\cite=br] and [\cite=g2]), which follows from the properties of algebraic independent sets, will be used.

We can assume that Πt and ΠT are determined by the first t and T coordinates, respectively. Let π be the projection of m into the space m - t determined by the last m - t coordinates. Then Πd - t  =  π(Πd) is a (d - t)-plane in m - t parallel to the coordinate plane ΠT - t  =  π(ΠT). Moreover, the set of the coordinates of all points Bi,j  =  π(Ai,j) is algebraically independent (as a subset of the coordinates of the points Ai,j). Therefore, we can assume that t = 0 by considering the space m - t determined by the last m - t coordinates and the projections Bi,j, π(Πd), and π(ΠT) into this space.

Since Yi∈Π(Mi), there are numbers [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula] for all i = 1,...,q.

For any i at least one of the numbers [formula], say [formula], is different from zero (we can even suppose that all [formula], otherwise we reduce the sets Mi by excluding the corresponding point Ai,j). Therefore, by (1), Ai,1 can be represented as a linear combination of the points Ai,2,...,Ai,ni + 1, Yi. Hence, ni additional numbers [formula] are obtained.

Consequently, all coordinates of the points [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 1,...,ni + 1 are expressed in terms of the coordinates of the points [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 2,...,ni + 1, [formula], and the numbers [formula], i = 1,...,q, [formula].

I. Let q  ≤  d + 1. Since Πd is parallel to ΠT, the plane Y1  +  ΠT contains all points Y2,...,Yq. So,

[formula], i = 2,...,q,

where [formula] denotes the j-th unit coordinate vector.

Therefore, any coordinate of the points [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 1,...,ni + 1, is algebraically dependent on the set of all coordinates of the points Y1 and [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 2,...,ni + 1, and the numbers [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 1,...,ni, αi,j, i = 2,...,q, j = 1,...,T.

Hence, by Proposition 2.1, qm  ≤  m + n1 + ... + nq + T(q - 1). So,

[formula].

Observe that (3)I does not change if m, d and T are replaced by m - t, d - t and T - t, respectively. Therefore, (3)I remains true for any t with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d.

II. Let q  ≥  d + 1. Since all points Y1,...,Yq are in Πd, there are d + 1 of them, say Y1,...,Yd + 1, such that each Yj, j = d + 2,...,q, is a linear combination of the points Yi, i = 1,...,d + 1. Let us note that, such d + 1 points exist even the linear hull of Y1,...,Yq is of dimension < d. Therefore,

[formula], j = d + 2,...,q,

for some numbers [formula], i = 1,...,d, j = d + 2,...,q.

In this case equations (2)I are true for i = 2,...,d + 1. So, any coordinate of the points [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 1,...,ni + 1, is algebraically dependent on the set of all coordinates of the points Y1 and [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 2,...,ni + 1, and the numbers [formula], i = 1,...,q, j = 1,...,ni, βj,i, j = d + 2,...,q, i = 1,...,d, αi,j, i = 2,...,d + 1, j = 1,...,T.

Hence, according to Proposition 2.1, qm  ≤  m + n1 + ... + nq + (q - d - 1)d + Td, or equivalently n1 + ... + nq  ≥  (m - d)(q - 1) - (T - d)d. Replacing in the last inequality m, d and T by m - t, d - t and T - t, respectively, we obtain that

n1 + ... + nq  ≥  (m - d)(q - 1) - (T - d)(d - t).

The inequalities (3)I and (3)II complete the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Corollary 1.2. We need the following considerations due to Roberts [\cite=r]. Let {ri} be a fixed infinite set which is algebraically independent, i.e. every finite subset is algebraically independent. Let Ri  =  {q + ri:q∈}, [formula] is the set of rational numbers. Then each Ri is dense in [formula] and Ri's are disjoint. Moreover, any finite set M is algebraically independent provided M contains at most one point from each Ri, i = 1,2,... .

Let {vi} denote the vertexes of K and Rj are the algebraically independent sets considered above. For each i we choose a point Ai = (Ai(1),...,Ai(m))∈m such that [formula] and Ai(s)∈R(i - 1)m + s. Then the set of all coordinates {Ai(k)} is algebraically independent. We define g:K  →  m by g(vi) = Ai and extend g linearly on every simplex of K. Obviously, g(vi1)  ≠  g(vi2) when i1  ≠  i2. Moreover, the map g, restricted to any n-simplex of K is one-to-one. Let Πd be a d-plane in Rm parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT and q be the number of disjoint at most n-dimensional simplexes σi =  < vi,j:j = 1,...,ni + 1 >  from K whose images g(σi) =  < Ai,j:j = 1,...,ni + 1 >  under g meets Πd. Let show that [formula] if n  ≥  (m - n - T)(d - t).

Suppose q  ≥  d + 1 - t. Since Πd intersects all images [formula], i = 1,...,q, by Theorem 1.1, n1 + ... + nq  ≥  (m - d)(q - 1) - (T - d)(d - t). Consequently,

[formula]

because ni  ≤  n for each i. Inequality (4) is equivalent to the required inequality q  ≤  N1.

If q  ≤  d + 1 - t, then q  ≤  N1 holds because our assumption n  ≥  (m - n - T)(d - t) implies d + 1 - t  ≤  N1.

Now, let show that [formula] provided n  ≤  (m - n - T)(d - t).

Suppose q  ≤  d - t + 1. Then, by Theorem 1.1, n1 + ... + nq  ≥  (m - T)(q - 1). Therefore,

[formula].

Since (5) is equivalent to q  ≤  N2, this case is completed.

Finally, let q  ≥  d - t + 1. Then, as we already proved, q  ≤  N1. On the other hand, according to our assumption n  ≤  (m - n - T)(d - t), we have d - t + 1  ≥  N1. Hence, q = d - t + 1 = N1 which implies n = (m - n - T)(d - t). So, q = d - t + 1 = N1 = N2.

Proof of Theorem 1.3

First, we are going to prove Theorem 1.3 in the special case when d = m - n. So, we fix spaces X, Y and a map f satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3. If not explicitely stated otherwise, we use the following notations in this section: ϱ denotes the Euclidean metric in m and an ε-disjoint set in m is a set which can be covered by a family of open and disjoint subsets of m each of diameter <  ε. We say that a given set A  ⊂  m is of type (d,ε) if [formula] is ε-disjoint for every d-plane Πd in m.

Let Hε, ε > 0, denote the set of maps g∈C*(X,m) such that g(f- 1(y)) is of type (m - n,ε) for every y∈Y. Since C*(X,m) equipped with the source limitation topology has the Baire property, it suffices to show that each of the sets Hε is open and dense in C*(X,m). Indeed, then [formula] would be dense and Gδ in C*(X,m). Moreover, if g∈H and y∈Y, then [formula] is at most 0-dimensional for every (n - m)-plane Π  ⊂  m.

Let A  ⊂  X be compact and ε > 0. Suppose the set g0(A) is of type (d,ε) for some g0∈C*(X,m) and d. Then there exists a neighborhood U of A in X and δ > 0 such that [formula] is of type (d,ε) provided g∈C*(X,m) and g|U is δ-close to g0|U.

Assume the conclusion of the lemma is not true. To obtain a contradiction we follow [\cite=r]. For every i  ≥  1 take a neighborhood Ui of A such that Ui  ⊂  g- 10(Wi) with Wi being a [formula]-neighborhood of g0(A). There exist gi∈C*(X,m) and a d-plane Πdi such that gi|Ui is [formula]-close to g0|Ui but [formula] is not ε-disjoint. Choose the points [formula] and xi∈Ui such that [formula], i  ≥  1. Obviously, [formula] is a compactum intersecting each Πdi. Therefore, there exists a subsequence of {Πdi}∞i = 1 converging to a d-plane Πd0. We suppose that {Πdi}∞i = 1 itself converges to Πd0.

Let V be an open subset of m containing [formula] and such that it is the union of a finite disjoint and open family in m having elements of diameter <  ε. Because each [formula] is not ε-disjoint, there exist points ai∈Ui and [formula] such that V doesn't contain the set {gi(ai),bi}∞i = 1. We can also require that [formula] for all i. This implies the existence of a point b∈g0(A) and a subsequence of {bi} converging to b. We still write [formula]. Then b∈Πd0 because {Πdi} converges to Πd0. Hence, [formula]. Consequently, bi∈V for some i which contradicts the choice of bi.

Suppose g0(f- 1(y0)) is of type (m - n,ε) for some y0∈Y and g0∈C*(X,m). Then, there exists a neighborhood V of y0 in Y and δ > 0 such that the set [formula] is of type (m - n,ε) for every g∈C*(X,m) with g|f- 1(V) being δ-close to g0|f- 1(V).

Applying Lemma 3.1 for f- 1(y0), we obtain δ > 0 and a neighborhood U of f- 1(y0) such that [formula] is of type (m - n,ε) provided g∈C*(X,m) with g|U being δ-close to g0|U. Since f is closed, we can find a closed neighborhood V of y0 in Y with f- 1(V)  ⊂  U. Now, let g|f- 1(V) be δ-close to g0|f- 1(V) for some g∈C*(X,m). Extend g|f- 1(V) to a map h∈C*(X,m) such that h|U remains δ-close to g0|U. Then, according to the choice of U and δ, [formula] is of type (m - n,ε). Finally, since [formula] and h|f- 1(V) = g|f- 1(V), we are done.

We fix g0∈Hε. By Corollary 3.2, for every y∈Y there exists a neighborhood Vy of y in Y and δy > 0 such that if g∈C*(X,m) and [formula] for all x∈f- 1(Vy), then [formula] is of type (m - n,ε). Take a locally finite open cover ω of Y refining {Vy:y∈Y} and for each W∈ω fix y(W)∈Y such that W  ⊂  Vy(W). Define the set-valued map φ:Y  →   (0,  ∞  ) by [formula]. Obviously, φ is convex-valued and lower semi-continuous. By [\cite=rs], φ admits a continuous selection β:Y  →   (0,  ∞  ) and let [formula]. It suffices to show that g∈C*(X,m) and [formula] for every x∈X imply g∈Hε. To this end, let y∈Y and select W∈ω containing y such that α(x)  ≤  δy(W) for every x∈f- 1(y). Take a function hy∈C*(X,m) coinciding with g on the set f- 1(y) and satisfying the inequality [formula] for all x∈X. Then, according to the choice of Vy(W), the set [formula] is of type (m - n,ε), so is [formula]. Hence, any g∈C*(X,m) which is α-close to g0 belongs to Hε. Therefore, Hε is open in C*(X,m).

For every space M and ε > 0 let [formula] denote the set of all g∈C*(M,m) such that g(M) is of type (m - n,ε) provided m  ≥  n + 1.

Let M be an n-dimensional compactum and m  ≥  n + 1. Then [formula] is dense in C(M,m) for every ε > 0.

Let g0∈C(M,m) and δ > 0. Representing g0 as the composition of two maps q1:M  →  Z and q2:Z  →  m, where Z is a metrizable compactum of dimension ≤  n, and considering Z and q2 instead of M and g0, we reduce our proof to the case M is a metrizable compactum. Take a positive number η satisfying the following conditions:

[formula] and [formula], where [formula].

Since dim M  ≤  n, by a standard procedure we can find a finite n-dimensional complex K and maps h:M  →  K and θ:K  →  m such that [formula] is [formula]-close to g0. Moreover, we can suppose that:

[formula] for every simplex σ∈K.

It suffices to find a map g:K  →  m which is [formula]-close to the map θ and [formula]. To this end, we apply Corollary 1.2 (with d = m - n, t = 0, T = m, ε  =  η and n replaced by n - 1) to obtain a semi-linear map g:K  →  m such that [formula] for all vertexes v of K and, for each (m - n)-plane Π  ⊂  m, the number q of disjoint at most (n - 1)-dimensional simplexes of K whose images under g intersect Π is ≤  r = n(m + 1 - n). We can choose g such that, in addition to the above requirements, we also have g(vi)  ≠  g(vj) for any different vertices vi and vj of K.

Let vi and vj be two vertices of the same simplex [formula]. Then, according to (7) and the choice of g, we have

[formula].

Consequently

[formula] is of diameter < 3η for any simplex [formula].

Item (8) implies that [formula] for all y∈K. Hence, by (6), g and θ are [formula]-close to each other.

It remains only to show that [formula], or equivalently, g(K) is of type (m - n,ε). To this end we use an idea of [\cite=r]. We fix a (m - n)-plane Π  ⊂  m. It is enough to prove that each component of [formula] is of diameter ≤  9(r + 1)η because, by (6), 9(r + 1)η  <  ε. Suppose ϱ(a,b) > 9(r + 1)η for some component P of [formula] and some points a,b∈P. There is an arc ab in P. Because of (8), every subarc of ab of diameter ≥  3η must contain at least one point on the boundary of a simplex of g(K), hence on a simplex of g(K) of dimension ≤  n - 1. Next, we take points ai∈ab, i = 1,...,r + 1 such that: 3(3i - 2)η  <  ϱ(a,ai)  ≤  3(3i - 1)η, i = 1,...,r + 1, and each ai belongs to a simplex g(σi)∈g(K) with σi being of dimension ≤  n - 1. Then, ϱ(ai,aj) > 6η for i  ≠  j which, according to (8), implies [formula]. Therefore, we obtained r + 1 disjoint simplexes σi∈K, i = 1,...,r + 1, each of them having dimension ≤  n - 1 whose images under g meets Π. This is a contradiction because, according to the choice of g, the number of pairwise disjoint at most (n - 1)-dimensional simplexes of K whose images under g intersect Π is ≤  n(m - n + 1) = r.

Below we consider the set-valued map [formula] defined by [formula], where Hε(y) denotes the set of all g∈C*(X,m) such that g(f- 1(y)) is of type (m - n,ε).

Next proposition, combined with Proposition 3.3, will complete the proof of Theorem 1.3 for d = m - n.

We first show that the graph G of ψε is closed in Y  ×  C*(X,m) provided C*(X,m) is equipped with the uniform convergence topology generated by the metric ϱ. Let [formula]. Then [formula], so g0∈Hε(y0). By Corollary 3.2, there exists δ > 0 and a neighborhood V of y0 in Y such that [formula] is of type (m - n,ε) for every g∈C*(X,m) with g|f- 1(V) being δ-close to g0|f- 1(V). Let W  ⊂  C*(X,m) be the set of all g which are δ-close to g0. Obviously, W is a neighborhood of g0 in C*(X,m) with respect to the uniform convergence topology, so V  ×  W is a neighborhood of (y0,g0) in Y  ×  C*(X,m) which doesn't meet G. Therefore, G is closed in Y  ×  C*(X,m).

Claim. [formula] for every y∈Y, α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) and g0∈C*(X,m).

We need to show that [formula] for fixed y∈Y, α∈C(X,(0,  ∞  )) and g0∈C*(X,m). Let δ > 0 be the minimal value of α on f- 1(y). Since dim f- 1(y)  ≤  n, by Lemma 3.4, there exists h∈C(f- 1(y),m) which is δ-close to g0|f- 1(y) and such that h(f- 1(y)) is of type (m - n,ε). Obviously, [formula] for all x∈f- 1(y). So, every extension g∈C*(X,m) of h would be in Hε(y). Hence, the proof is reduced to find such an extension of h which is also in [formula]. To this end, we define the set-valued map Φ:X  →  m by Φ(x) = h(x) if x∈f- 1(y) and [formula] if [formula]. Here [formula] denotes the closed ball in m having center g0(x) and radius α(x). This map is lower semi-continuous with closed and convex values in m. Hence, by Michael's convex-valued selection theorem, Φ admits a continuous selection g which extends h. Moreover, we can assume that α is a bounded function, which implies that g is also bounded. Therefore, [formula], which completes the proof of the claim.

We are now in a position to finish the proof of our proposition. Fix g0∈C*(X,m) and α∈C*(X,(0,1)), and consider the constant set-valued map φ:Y  →  C*(X,m), [formula], where C*(X,m) is equipped with the uniform convergence topology. Now, we need the following theorem of Michael [\cite=m]: Let Y be paracompact with dim Y = 0, M a completely metrizable, and φ:Y  →  M a lower semi-continuous closed-valued map. If ψ:Y  →  M is a set-valued map with a closed graph such that [formula] for every y∈Y, then φ has a selection avoiding ψ. In our case φ and ψε satisfy the hypotheses of the Michael's theorem, so there exists a map θ:Y  →  C*(X,m) such that [formula] for all y∈Y. We define the map g∈C*(X,m), g(x) = θ(f(x)), x∈X. Then [formula] for every y∈Y. Consequently, [formula] and we are done.

As we already mentioned, it follows from Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.5 that the set H is dense and Gδ in C*(X,m). This provides the proof of Theorem 1.3 in the special case d = m - n. Let us prove the general case of Theorem 1.3. We are going to show that every g∈H satisfies the theorem, i.e. it satisfies the following condition: [formula] is at most (n + d - m)-dimensional for every y∈Y and every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - n + 1  ≤  d  ≤  m. Fix some (m - n)-plane Πm - n  ⊂  Πd and consider the orthogonal projection p of Πd onto the (n + d - m)-plane Πn + d - m  ⊂  Πd which is the orthogonal complement of Πm - n in Πd. Then the compactum [formula] is of dimension ≤  n + d - m. Obviously, any fiber of the mapping p|A:A  →  B is the intersection of g(f- 1(y)) and some (m - n)-plane. So, according to the choice of g, p|A has zero-dimensional fibers. Therefore, by Hurewicz's theorem about perfect zero-dimensional maps, dim A  ≤   dim B  ≤  n + d - m.

It suffices to show that, for any integers d,t,T with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m and d  ≤  m - n - 1, and any coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT in m, C*(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps g such that [formula] has at most q points for every y∈Y and every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m parallel to Πt  ⊂  ΠT, where q is the integer part of [formula] if n  ≥  (m - n - T)(d - t) and the integer part of [formula] otherwise. So, we fix integers n,d,t,T satisfying the above inequalities and coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT  ⊂  m. Observe that always q  ≥  1, and let P be the set of all d-planes in m parallel to Πt  ⊂  ΠT. We now define the following augmented notion which is used in this section: A subset A of an arbitrary metric space M is said to be of cotype (q,ε,g), where ε > 0 and g∈C*(M,m), if for any Πd∈P, the set [formula] can be covered by at most q disjoint open sets in M each of diameter ≤  ε. Let Kε, ε > 0, denote the set of all maps g∈C*(X,m) such that f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,g) for every y∈Y. The proof is reduced to show that each Kε is open and dense in C*(X,m).

Let A be a compact subset of X which is of cotype (q,ε,g0) for some g0∈C*(X,m) and ε > 0. Then there exists a neighborhood U of A in X and δ > 0 with U being of cotype (q,ε,g) for every g∈C*(X,m) such that g|U is δ-close to g0|U.

Suppose the lemma is not true. For every i  ≥  1 take a [formula]-neighborhood Ui of A such that g0(Ui) is within [formula]-neighborhood of g0(A) in m. Then, there exist gi∈C*(X,m) and a d-plane Πdi∈P such that gi|Ui is [formula]-close to g0|Ui, but [formula] is not covered by any family of ≤  q open disjoint sets in X with diameters ≤  ε. As in the proof of Lemma 3.1, passing to subsequences, we can suppose that {Πdi}∞i = 1 converges to a d-plane Πd0. Since all Πdi are from P (i.e., parallel to Πt  ⊂  ΠT), so is Πd0. Hence, [formula] is covered by a disjoint family {Vj} of ≤  q open sets in X with diameters ≤  ε. Take points [formula] and yi∈A such that [formula], i = 1,2,..., where [formula]. We can assume that the sequence xi converges to some x0∈A (recall that A is compact). Then {gi(xi)} converges to g0(x0) and [formula]. Therefore, [formula]. So, xi∈V for almost all i which is a contradiction.

The proof of next corollary is similar to that one of Corollary 3.2.

Suppose f- 1(y0) is of cotype (q,ε,g0) for some y0∈Y and g0∈C*(X,m). Then, there exists a neighborhood V of y0 in Y and δ > 0 such that the set f- 1(V) is of cotype (q,ε,g) for every g∈C*(X,m) with g|f- 1(V) being δ-close to g0|f- 1(V).

The proof follows the arguments from the proof of Proposition 3.3, but now we apply Corollary 4.2 instead of Corollary 3.2.

Let M be a metrizable at most n-dimensional compactum. Then the set K0(M,m) of all g∈C(M,m) such that g- 1(Πd) consists of at most q points for every Πd∈P, is dense in C(M,m).

Let Ω be the collection of all disjoint families [formula] of q + 1 elements such that each Vj belongs to a fixed base for M. Let also

[formula], Γ∈Ω.

Obviously, Ω is countable and K0(M,m) is the intersection of all sets CΓ, Γ∈Ω. Therefore, our proof is reduced to show that each CΓ is dense and open in C(M,m).

Every CΓ is open in C(M,m).

We fix Γ∈Ω and g0∈CΓ. Suppose, for every i there exists [formula] with gi being 1 / i-close to g0. So, we can find Πdi∈P such that g- 1i(Πdi) meets every element of Γ. As in Lemma 3.1, we can suppose that the sequence {Πdi} converges to some Πd0∈P. Then g- 10(Πd0) intersects at most q elements of Γ, let say the first q. Now, for every i, choose a point [formula] and, since M is compact, we can assume that the sequence {xi} converges to some [formula]. Then, {gi(xi)} converges to g0(x0)∈Πd0. So, [formula] which is a contradiction.

Every CΓ is dense in C(M,m).

Let [formula], g0∈CΓ and δ > 0. There exist an open cover ω of M with [formula], where [formula], and a semi-linear map h:L  →  m such that [formula] is δ-close to g0. Here L is the polyhedron underlying the nerve of ω and π:M  →  L is the canonical map. According to Corollary 1.2, we can assume that for any Πd∈P, the number of pairwise disjoint, at most n-dimensional simplexes σ∈L with h(σ) meeting Πd, is ≤  q. We can also assume that ω is of order ≤  n + 1, so L is at most n-dimensional. If there exists a plane Π*∈P with g- 1(Π*) intersecting every [formula], choose [formula], and let ωi be the family of those elements of ω containing the point xi. Then each family ωi, i = 1,...,q + 1, generates a simplex σi∈L of dimension ≤  n such that [formula] and [formula] for i  ≠  j. This contradicts the choice of h.

Since K0(M,m)  ⊂  Kε(M,m) for every ε > 0, where Kε(M,m) is the set of all maps g∈C*(M,m) with M being of cotype (q,ε,g), Lemma 4.4 implies the following corollary:

Let M be a metrizable compactum of dimension ≤  n. Then any Kε(M,m) is dense in C(M,m).

Finally, next proposition, combined with Proposition 4.3, completes the proof of Theorem 1.5.

Let [formula] be the set-valued map [formula], where Kε(y) denotes the set of all g∈C*(X,m) such that f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,g). Further, the proof follows the arguments from the proof of Proposition 3.5. To show that the graph of ψε is closed, we use now Corollary 4.2 instead of Corollary 3.2. Also, the application of Lemma 3.4 should be replaced by that one of Corollary 4.5 in the proof of the claim.

Proof of Theorem 1.7. We are going to prove that C*(X,l2) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps g such that for every y∈Y and every Πd∈P(d,r), [formula] has at most [formula] points if r  ≤  d and at most one point otherwise. For given integers d,r let Q be the set of all d-planes parallel to the r-plane of first r coordinates in l2. As in Theorem 1.5, we introduce the notion of a (q,ε,g)-cotype subset of a metric space M considering now planes Πd∈Q and taking q = d + 1 - r in case d  ≥  r and q = 1 otherwise. Let Fε, ε > 0, denote the set of all maps g∈C*(X,l2) such that f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,g) for every y∈Y. It suffices to show that each Fε is open and dense in C*(X,l2). Following the proof of Theorem 1.5, we can show that all Fε are open in C*(X,l2). To prove density of Fε, we use the following lemma.

Let M be a metrizable compactum and ε > 0. Then the set Fε(M,l2) of all g∈C(M,l2) such that M is of cotype (q,ε,g), is dense in C(M,l2).

We take g0∈C(M,l2) and λ > 0. Then, there exist maps φ:M  →  K and h:K  →  l2 such that K is a finite complex and [formula] is λ / 2-close to g0. Moreover, we can assume that each fiber of φ has diameter <  ε. For every A  ⊂   we identify A with the subspace [formula] of l2, and denote by πA the canonical projection πA:l2  →  A. Let dim K = n and A  ⊂   be any finite set satisfying the following conditions: (i) {1,...,r}  ⊂  A; (ii) |A|  ≥  r + d + 2n + n  ·  |d - r| + 1, where |A| is the cardinality of A. Since every projection πA is open, we can show that the map ΛA:C(K,l2)  →  C(K,A), [formula], is also open.

Suppose first that r  ≤  d. Observe that, if T = m, then (m - n - T)(d - r) =  - n(d - r)  ≤  0, so n  ≥  (m - n - T)(d - r). Hence, applying Theorem 1.5 with m = T = |A| and t = r, there is a dense Gδ subset FA of C(K,A) consisting of maps g such that g- 1(Πd) contains at most [formula] points for every d-plane Πd  ⊂  A parallel to the r-plane of first r coordinates in A. Since |A|  ≥  r + d + 2n + n  ·  (d - r) + 1, any preimage g- 1(Πd), g∈FA, contains at most [formula] points. The set [formula] is also dense and Gδ in C(K,l2). Therefore, there exists [formula] which is λ / 2-close to h. Then [formula] is λ-close to g0. It remains only to show that [formula]. To this end, take Πd∈Q. Since ΠdA  =  πA(Πd) is a d-plane in A parallel to the r-plane of first r coordinates in A, [formula] contains [formula] points. Formally the plane ΠdA can has dimension < d, but in this case the estimation on the cardinality of preimage is even better. The inclusion Πd  ⊂  π- 1A(ΠdA) implies that g- 1(Πd) contains ≤  1 + d - r points. Hence, [formula] consists of ≤  1 + d - r fibers of φ. Since any fiber of φ is of diameter <  ε, [formula].

Suppose d  ≤  r. We again apply Theorem 1.5 to A, but now for m = |A|, t = 0 and T = r. Obviously, in this case (m - n - T)(d - t) > n. Therefore, there is a dense Gδ subset FA of C(K,A) consisting of maps g such that g- 1(Πd) contains at most one point for every d-plane in A parallel to the r-plane of first r coordinates in A. As before, we take [formula] which is λ / 2-close to h and show that [formula].

We follow the proof of Proposition 3.5, describing the necessary changes. In our situation [formula] is defined by [formula], where Fε(y) denotes the set of all g∈C*(X,l2) such that f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,g) with q = 1 + d - r if r  ≤  d and q = 1 otherwise. To show that [formula] has a closed graph, we apply the analogue of Corollary 4.2 for the space C*(X,l2) instead of Corollary 3.2. We also need the following claim.

Let g0∈C*(X,l2), α:X  →  (0,  ∞  ) and y∈Y. Then, for any ε > 0, [formula] is a Z-set in [formula] provided [formula] is considered as a subset of C*(X,l2) with the uniform convergence topology.

The proof of this claim partly follows the arguments from the proof of [\cite=tv]. We need to show that every map [formula], where Q is the Hilbert cube, can be approximated by a map [formula] avoiding the set [formula]. So, we fix such a map h and η > 0. Then h generates the map u:Q  ×  X  →  l2, u(z,x) = h(z)(x), such that dist(u(z,x),g0(x))  ≤  α(x) for any (z,x)∈Q  ×  X. Choose λ∈(0,1) with λ sup {α(x):x∈f- 1(y)}  <  η / 2 and define u1∈C(Q  ×  f- 1(y),l2) by u1(z,x) = (1 - λ)u(z,x) + λg0(x). For every (z,x)∈Q  ×  f- 1(y) we have

dist(u1(z,x),g0(x)) < α(x) and dist(u1(z,x),u(z,x)) < η / 2.

Let δ  <   inf {η / 2,α(x) - dist(u1(z,x),g0(x)):(z,x)∈Q  ×  f- 1(y)}. By Lemma 4.7, there exists a map u2:Q  ×  f- 1(y)  →  l2 such that Q  ×  f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,u2) and dist(u1(z,x),u2(z,x)) < δ for all (z,x)∈Q  ×  f- 1(y). Then

dist(u2(z,x),g0(x)) < α(x) and dist(u2(z,x),u(z,x)) < η

provided (z,x)∈Q  ×  f- 1(y). The equality h2(z)(x) = u2(z,x) determines a map h2:Q  →  C(f- 1(y),l2) such that f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,h2(z)) for every z∈Q. One can show that the projection map [formula], pr(g) = g|f- 1(y), is open with respect to the uniform convergence topology and [formula] contains h2(Q). This yields that h2 can be lifted to a map [formula] such that w is η-close to h. Observe that w avoids the set [formula] because f- 1(y) is of cotype (q,ε,h2(z)) for all z∈Q. This completes the proof of the claim.

Let us go back to the proof of Proposition 4.8. For a fixed g∈C*(X,l2) and a function α:X  →  (0,1) consider the set-valued map φ:Y  →  C*(X,l2), [formula], where C*(X,l2) carries the uniform convergence topology. According to the claim above, [formula] is a Z-set in φ(y) for all y∈Y. Moreover, Y is a C-space, so we can apply [\cite=gv] to find a map θ:Y  →  C*(X,l2) such that [formula] for all y∈Y. Finally, we define the map [formula] by [formula], x∈X. Then, [formula] for every y∈Y. Hence, [formula], which completes the proof of Proposition 4.8.

Therefore, the proof of Theorem 1.7 is done.

Appendix

Let us provide some more applications of our results.

Let f:X  →  Y be a perfect map between paracompact spaces with dim Y = 0. Suppose {Fi} is a sequence of closed subsets of X and {ni} a sequence of integers such that dim f|Fi  ≤  ni for all i. If n  ≥  ni, i = 1,2,..., then for every m  ≥  n + 1 the space C*(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps g such that for any i and any d-plane Πd  ⊂  m, where m - ni  ≤  d  ≤  m, we have [formula], for any y∈Y.

The proof of Theorem 5.1 is based on Lemma 5.2 below. Indeed, for every i we apply Theorem 1.3 for the spaces Fi, f(Fi) and the map f|Fi to conclude that C*(Fi,m) contains a dense Gδ-set Hi of maps g such that [formula] for every y∈f(Fi) and every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - ni  ≤  d  ≤  m. Since, by Lemma 5.2, each restriction map πi:C*(X,m)  →  C*(Fi,m) is open, Ki  =  π- 1i(Hi) is dense and Gδ in C*(X,m). Then the intersection of all Ki satisfies the requirements of Theorem 5.1.

Let F be a closed subset of the normal space X and m  ≥  1. Then the restriction map π:C*(X,m)  →  C*(F,m), defined by π(g) = g|F, is open if both C*(X,m) and C*(F,m) are equipped simultaneously either with the source limitation topology or the uniform convergence topology.

Next corollary of Theorem 5.1 can be established in the same way as Corollary 1.4 was obtained from Theorem 1.3.

Let {Fi} be a sequence of closed subsets of the normal space X with dim Fi  ≤  ni. If m  ≥  ni + 1 for each i, then C*(X,m) equipped with the uniform convergence topology contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps g such that [formula] is at most (ni + d - m)-dimensional for every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - ni  ≤  d  ≤  m, i = 1,2,... .

Our final application is an analogue of the Fox theorem [\cite=f] about economical extensions of maps. If A is a closed subset of a space X and h∈C*(A,m), then C*h(X,m) denotes all maps g∈C*(X,m) such that g|A = h. Everywhere below C*h(X,m) is considered as a subspace of C*(X,m) with the uniform convergence topology.

Let X be a normal space and A a closed Gδ-subset of X with [formula]. Then, for any m  ≥  n + 1 and h∈C*(A,m), there exists a dense and Gδ-set in C*h(X,m) of maps g such that [formula] is at most (n + d - m)-dimensional for every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - n  ≤  d  ≤  m.

Let {Fi} be a sequence of closed subsets of X with [formula] and h∈C*(A,m). By Corollary 1.4, each C*(Fi,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset Hi of maps g with

[formula] for any d-plane Πd  ⊂  m, where m - n  ≤  d  ≤  m.

Using that Fi and A are closed and disjoint subsets of X, one can show that every projection pi:C*h(X,m)  →  C*(Fi,m), pi(g) = g|Fi, is open and surjective when both C*h(X,m) and C*(Fi,m) are equipped with the uniform convergence topology. Hence, Ki = p- 1i(Hi) is dense and Gδ in C*h(X,m). Since C*h(X,m) has the Baire property, [formula] is dense and Gδ in C*h(X,m). Finally, observe that (9) implies [formula] for every g∈K and every d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m - n  ≤  d  ≤  m.

Finally, let us discuss some possible improvements of our results.

Conjecture 1. Let f:X  →  Y be a map of finite dimensional metrizable compacta. Then, C(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps φ such that, for any integers d,t,T with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m and dim f + d + 1  ≤  m and for any d-plane Πd  ⊂  m, parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT in m, each set [formula], y∈Y, has no more than

[formula]

points.

Obviously, Theorem 1.5 implies the validity of Conjecture 1 in case Y is 0-dimensional.

Conjecture 2. Let f:X  →  Y be a map of finite-dimensional compacta. Then, C(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset of maps φ such that

[formula]

for any d-plane Πd  ⊂  m with m -  dim f  ≤  d  ≤  m and any y∈Y.

Theorem 1.3 provides the validity of Conjecture 2 in case Y is 0-dimensional. As in Theorem 1.3, it suffices to establish Conjecture 2 in the special case d = m -  dim f. Conjecture 2 is also true when dim f = 0, this is Uspenskij's theorem [\cite=u] about light mappings (see also [\cite=tv1] for a generalization of the Uspenskij result when dim f > 0).

Let f:X  →  Y, φ∈C(X,m) and t,d,T be integers with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m and d - t + 1  ≤  q. Below we consider the set [formula] consisting of all points [formula] satisfying the following condition: there exist points x1,...,xq∈f- 1(y) with [formula] such that yi  =  φ(xi) and all yi, i = 1,...,q, belong to a d-plane in m parallel to some coordinates planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT  ⊂  m.

Conjecture 3. Let f:X  →  Y be a map of finite-dimensional metrizable compacta. Then C(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-set H of maps φ such that

[formula]

for any integers d,t,T,q satisfying the conditions 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m, d - t + 1  ≤  q and dim f + d + 1  ≤  m.

If the right side of the inequality from Conjecture 3 is ≤   - 1, then the set [formula] is empty. Conditions when [formula] is empty are discussed in Conjecture 1. If d = 0, the set [formula] does not depend on T. In this case it is homeomorphic to the set [formula]. For d = 0 and Y a point, the statement of Conjecture 3 was obtained in 1933 by Hurewicz [\cite=h] (recall that the maps φ∈H from the Hurewicz theorem are called regularly branched maps [\cite=drs]). A parametric version of the Hurewicz result was obtained in [\cite=tv2]. Following the terminology of [\cite=tv2], the inequality from Conjecture 3 is satisfied for d = 0 and all q  ≥  1 if and only if φ is an f-regularly branched map. By [\cite=tv2], C(X,m) contains a dense Gδ-subset of f-regularly branched maps, so Conjecture 3 holds for d = 0. Let us note that for d  ≥  1, even in the case when Y is a point, the conjecture is open.

For maps [formula], i = 1,...,q, and integers 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m, let [formula] be the set of the points [formula] such that the points [formula], i = 1,...,q, belong to a d-plane in m parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT. Let also

[formula]

Conjecture 4. Let the numbers n1,...,nq,m,d,t,T satisfy the inequalities 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m, 0  ≤  n1, ..., 0  ≤  nq, n1 + 1 + d  ≤  m, ..., nq + 1 + d  ≤  m, d - t + 1  ≤  q and

[formula]

Then, there exist ε > 0 and maps [formula], i = 1,...,q, such that the set [formula] is not empty for any maps [formula] with each gi being ε-close to fi, i = 1,...,q.

In the simplest case (q = 1, n1 = 0, n2 = m, d = 0), the statement of Conjecture 4 is exactly the Alexandrov theorem that the identity map of the ball onto itself is essential. For d = 0 Conjecture 4 is also true (see for example [\cite=b1], [\cite=bms]). In the case d = q - 1, t = 0 nd T = m Conjecture 4 was proved by Boltyanski [\cite=b] (this is the main ingredient in his proof that m  ≥  nk + n + k provided for some n-dimensional polyhedron X the set of k-regular maps from X into m is dense in C(X,m)).

Conjecture 5. Let the numbers n1,...,nq,m,d,t,T satisfy the inequalities 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m, 0  ≤  n1, ..., 0  ≤  nq, n1 + 1 + d  ≤  m, ..., nq + 1 + d  ≤  m, d - t + 1  ≤  q. Then, there exist ε > 0 and maps [formula], i = 1,...,q, such that

[formula]

for any maps [formula] with each gi being ε-close to fi, i = 1,...,q.

For d = 0 the statement of Conjecture 5 was established in [\cite=b1].

We are going to finish with the following problem, where [formula] denotes the n-dimensional skeleton of the N-dimensional simplex [formula].

Problem. Find all integers n,m,q,d,t,T with 0  ≤  t  ≤  d  ≤  T  ≤  m, n + 1 + d  ≤  m, d - t + 1  ≤  q,

[formula]

and satisfying the following condition: There exists a number N such that for any mapping [formula] we can find pairwise disjoint simplexes [formula] whose images under f meet a d-plane Πd  ⊂  m parallel to some coordinate planes Πt  ⊂  ΠT.

Observe that, if the above problem has a positive solution for some numbers n,m,q,d,t,T satisfying the assumptions of the problem, then Theorem 2 can not be improved, not only on the level of a dense set of mappings, but also on the level of existence of one map with preimages having small cardinality, even in the class of polyhedra. Most of the results providing the existence of such a number N were established for d = 0: van Kampen and Flores [\cite=k], [\cite=fl] (q = 2 and N = 2n + 2); Sarkaria [\cite=s] (q prime and N = qn + 2q - 2); Volovikov [\cite=v] (q being a power of a prime number and N = qn + 2q - 2); Bogatyi [\cite=b1] (q = n + 1 and N  ≤  2n2 + 5n). Another result of Bogatyi [\cite=b4] provides such N for d = q - 1, t = 0, T = m with q being odd. ivaljevi obtained [\cite=z] a result about emdeddings of the graph K6,6 into 3 which implies a positive solution of the problem for n = 1, m = 3, t = 0, T = 3, q = 4 and N = 11.

If d = q - 1, q = 2, t = 0 and T = m, there is no any number N satisfying the conditions in the above problem, see [\cite=b].

The above problem can have a little different treatment: For a given family of integers n,q,d,t,T find the biggest number m for which such number N does exist. Then the question to determine the smallest such number N is arising. In this case, more complicated is the description of such minimal subpolyhedra in ΔNn. For n = 1, d = 0 and m = 2 the Kuratowski graphs K5 and K3,3 are minimal subpolyhedra.

Let us finally note that there exist connections between the above problem and conjectures about different forms of the Tverberg theorem [\cite=z], [\cite=b3]. It is also well known that k-regular mappings are closely related to interpolation and approximation problems. In view of this, it is important to find applications of the mappings described by Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.7 in interpolation and approximation problems.
