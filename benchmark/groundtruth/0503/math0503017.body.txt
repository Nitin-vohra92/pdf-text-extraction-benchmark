Intersection theory of toroidal compactifications of A4

Introduction

Let A4 denote the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension 4 over [formula]. There are two natural toroidal compactifications of A4, namely the Igusa compactification [formula] and the second Voronoi compactification [formula]. The first is given by the perfect cone or first Voronoi decomposition, which for g = 4 coincides with the central cone decomposition, and the latter is given by the second Voronoi decomposition.

It is well known that

[formula]

where [formula] is the closure of the locus rank 1 degenerations (i.e. semiabelian varieties with the rank of the abelian part equal to 3), and L is the [formula]-line bundle of weight 1 modular forms.

The fan given by the perfect cone decomposition is not basic for g = 4, and the second Voronoi decomposition is a basic refinement of the perfect cone decomposition (this is special to the case g = 4). Hence we have a morphism

[formula]

One knows (cf. [\cite=HS]) that

[formula]

where [formula] is again the closure of the rank 1 degenerations, and E is the divisor contracted to a point under the map π. One also knows from [\cite=HS] that

[formula]

Note that the Torelli map gives a morphism

[formula]

and since we have the morphism [formula], we can also define the morphism [formula]. We denote the images of these maps by [formula] and [formula] respectively. According to [\cite=HH], the classes of these Jacobian loci are given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

Using these relations and a toric computation we shall determine the intersection theory of [formula] and [formula]. For genus 4 this answers a question of N. Shepherd-Barron who posed in [\cite=SB] the problem of determining the intersection theory on [formula], which he showed to be the canonical model for Ag for g  ≥  12 (the Picard group of [formula] is generated by L and [formula] for all g  ≥  2).

In the cases g = 2,3 the Igusa compactification coincides with the Voronoi compactification and the computation of the intersection theory can easily be reduced via the Torelli map to calculations on [formula]. In fact for g = 2,3 the Chow ring of [formula] is known by the work of van der Geer ([\cite=vdG1]; see also [\cite=Mu], [\cite=Ts]). We will investigate the intersection theory of the Igusa compactification [formula] for arbitrary genus in a separate forthcoming paper.

The Igusa compactification

We shall first treat the Igusa compactification. Let

[formula]

The intersection theory on [formula] is given by

We first recall the computation of a10 = L10. It is well known (cf. [\cite=vdG2],[\cite=Ts]) that this number can be computed using the Hirzebruch-Mumford proportionality theorem (for any g). If Sk(Γg) denotes the space of weight k cusp forms, then by [\cite=Ta]

[formula]

where B2j are the Bernoulli numbers. Hence

[formula]

and a straightforward calculation gives

[formula]

We shall now make use of the Torelli map

[formula]

We obviously have

[formula]

where λ is the class of the Hodge bundle on [formula], and δ0 is the class of the closure of the locus of genus 3 curves with two points identified to form a node (i.e. the divisor of irreducible stable curves in M4). We let

[formula]

These intersection numbers on [formula] can be computed using C. Faber's program implementing his algorithm described in ([\cite=Fa]), and the result is shown in the following table:

Intersecting the relation

[formula]

with [formula] gives the recurrence relation

[formula]

Since a10 and the numbers bk - 1 are known, we can compute the numbers ak  -  1 recursively and arrive thus at the numbers stated.

In the literature one sometimes finds half the above number for [formula] -- see [\cite=vdG2]. This is the stack intersection number, since -[formula] acts trivially on the variety Ag, but defines an involution on the stack.

One can easily see geometrically that a9 = a8 = a7 = 0. This follows since L is a pullback of the corresponding line bundle on the Satake compactification [formula], for which the boundary is codimension 4, and where Lk for k  ≥  7 can be represented by a [formula]-cycle that does not meet the boundary.

The Voronoi compactification

Instead of working with the basis [formula] and E of [formula], it is easier to use [formula] and E. We already saw that [formula]. Let

[formula]

The intersection theory on [formula] is given by

[formula]

[formula]

Since L and F are the pullbacks under [formula] of L and [formula], we clearly have ak,0 = ak. Moreover, E is contracted to a point in [formula] under π, and hence [formula] for all l between 1 and 9.

It thus remains to compute E10. This can be done by the following toroidal computation. The second Voronoi decomposition for A4 is described in [\cite=V1], [\cite=V2a], [\cite=V2b], [\cite=ER2]. It is a refinement of the first Voronoi decomposition obtained by adding another ray η, generated by the sum of the primitive generators of the second perfect cone Π2(4). One then adds all the cones which arise as the span of η with each of the 9-dimensional faces of Π2(4) and the faces of these cones, together with their [formula] translates. Thus Π2(4) which was spanned by 12 rays [formula], is divided into sixty-four 10-dimensional basic cones. We abuse notations and denote the divisors in the toric variety defined by this decomposition corresponding to the rays η and [formula] by E and [formula] respectively. Among these divisors we have the following linear equivalences:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are the primitive generators of η and γi respectively (cf. [\cite=Ts]). We now multiply equation ([\ref=linrel]) successively by E9, then by E8Di, E7DiDj with i  ≠  j up to [formula]. This recursively gives a system of linear equations. Note that 10 distinct divisors either intersect transversally in one point if the 10 corresponding cones lie in a common 10-dimensional cone, or have empty intersection otherwise. This allows us to solve the above system of linear equations. This can be done by computer, and gives E10 =  - 1680. To get from this intersection number on the toric variety to the one on the moduli space, we have to divide by the order of the stabilizer of η in [formula]. The latter is the reflection group F4, the order of which is equal to 1152 (see Prop. 2.2 of [\cite=ER2] and also the proof of [\cite=HS].)
