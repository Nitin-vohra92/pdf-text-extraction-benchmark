On the Entropy Increase in the Black Hole Formation

Since the research of black hole thermodynamics was born a little over three decades ago[\cite=rf:BEK] [\cite=rf:BAR] [\cite=rf:HAW1], several striking concepts have been accepted. [\cite=rf:WAL] [\cite=rf:_FRO] [\cite=rf:_MUK] [\cite=rf:PAG] One of them is that the black hole entropy is proportional to the surface area. [\cite=rf:KIE] [\cite=rf:JAC] [\cite=rf:THO] However there are still questions about the fundamental concepts of the black hole entropy in its microscopic interpretation. [\cite=rf:BEK2] [\cite=rf:HEL] [\cite=rf:BOU] In this letter, we investigate this problem through the point that the entropy has increased enormously after the black hole formation. In the following, units with c = B = 1 are used, however in some cases the physical constants are expressed.�@

The spherical radiation dominated massive star is considered to collapse due to its gravitational instability. [\cite=rf:KIP] [\cite=rf:CAR] [\cite=rf:WEI] As the gravitational energy is almost equal to the thermal energy, the relation [formula] is satisfied, where M, [formula] and ε are the star mass, volume and radiation energy density, respectively. If we take [formula] , the relation r≃rg = 2M is derived in the final collapse stage of the black hole formation. If it is taken r≃(3M / (4πε))1 / 3≃rg, the temperature [formula] is estimated as

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are taken, being ã  =  π2k4B / (153c3). It shows [formula] and the total entropy [formula] is expressed by

[formula]

where A = 4πr2g and [formula] are the black hole surface area and Planck length, respectively. It should be noted that entropy S is proportional to A3 / 4, before black hole formation.

On the other hand, the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature and entropy of a black hole are TBH = 1 / (8πM) and [formula], respectively. Consequently the entropy has increased by an enormous factor [formula] during the black hole formation.

The massive star is to collapse even when r  ≫  rg and, if it is assumed to be adiabatic, the entropy is constant during the contraction before black hole formation. Because of S≃M / T before and after the black hole formation, this entropy increase is mainly due to the temperature decrease. Before the black hole formation, the temperature is [formula] and, after the black hole formation, it becomes [formula] .

If we consider that a black hole is mostly composed of black body radiation, the entropy increase could be understood through the relation [formula], then the black body temperature is related as [formula], where VBH is the effective black hole volume or the effective volume of the gravitationally collapsed object.[\cite=rf:SOR] For [formula], VBH is much greater than [formula] as [formula].

If the formation process is adiabatic, the temperature changes as [formula] and it is no concern for us, because the entropy does not change. If the process is free expansion, the temperature changes appropriately as [formula], because the internal energy is constant ([formula]), and/or, thermodynamically, the following relation is satisfied

[formula]

where p and cV are pressure and the specific heat at constant volume, respectively. Then the entropy increase could be interpreted as the free expansion of the radiation due to the volume increase by the black hole formation.[\cite=rf:SOR] It should be noted that the volume within an event horizon for Kerr-Newman solution is almost infinite, whereas the surface area is finite.

This interpretation of the volume increase [formula] is supplemented by the following consideration. The uncertainty principle ΔxΔp  ≥   shows one massless particle energy Δe should satisfy the relation Δe≃Δpc  ≥  Δx. Taking Δx≃rg = 2M, the upper limit of the particle number is given by [\cite=rf:ZUR] [\cite=rf:TOM]

[formula]

On the other hand, the number of single particle quantum states in phase space of a black hole is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are used. Then the number of ways W to distribute the NBH particles among the nBH states is

[formula]

Taking Stirling's formula ln n!≃n ln n - n, the entropy becomes as

[formula]

Then, even if an object to become a black hole is a neutron star and the nucleon number NN≃M / mN is much smaller than NBH, the entropy becomes [formula], taking into account the increase of the black hole phase space. It is the same for the massive star, where the photon number [formula] is of order [formula] , which is much smaller than NBH.

If we consider that a black hole is composed of massless particles with energy Δe, the temperature is on the order of T≃Δe≃3 / (GM)≃mplc2(mpl / M) [\cite=rf:_SCA]. The entropy becomes S≃M / T≃A / l2pl and the effective volume [formula] is estimated from [formula], which also indicates the increase of the effective black hole volume. The relation [formula] is also derived from [formula] .

The problem is the definition and the interpretation of the black hole volume. Taking the appropriate distribution of matter, the effective volume of the collapsing object could be enlarged [\cite=rf:SOR]. For the spherical configuration, the volume in general relativity is estimated as

[formula]

where grr = 1 - 2m(r) / r and m(r) are the radial metric component in spherical configuration and the mass within radius r, taking ξ = r - 2m(r)( > 0). The proper distance of the composed matter from its Schwarzschild radius is given by

[formula]

If we take the physical possible condition as

[formula]

where λ is the wave length of the matter(radiation), the volume VGR becomes

[formula]

since ξ- 1 / 2  ≤  r1 / 2λ- 1. Even if we take λ≃lpl, VGR  ≤  R4≃M4. So there is no good ways to derive VGR≃M5, before the black hole formation.

After the black hole formation (2m(r)  ≥  r), it is difficult to estimate the volume within the horizon, where time and radial coordinates are interchanged. If we take the time coordinate as spacelike and take the evaporation time of the black hole (tev≃M / (r2T4)≃M3  )     [\cite=rf:_HAW1] [\cite=rf:ZUR] [\cite=rf:_TOM] as the upper limit of the coordinate t, the effective volume within the black hole is estimated as VBH≃r2tev≃M5.

At the fundamental level, black holes are genuine quantum objects, where the de-Brogile length corresponding to the black hole temperature is comparable to the gravitational length, it is necessary to include the non local effect of the quantum mechanics for its entropy interpretation.

From the above consideration, the microscopic states of black hole entropy could be interpreted as the standard statistical state number in the phase space and the entropy could be taken as the extensive state quantity, even if it is proportional to the horizon surface area, if we accept the increase of the effective black hole volume. The enormous entropy increase and temperature decrease through the black hole formation are understandable as the free expansion of composed particles to this increased black hole volume.
