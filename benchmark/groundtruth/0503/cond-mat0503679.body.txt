Griffiths phase in the thermal quantum Hall effect

The integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) is observed in two-dimensional (2d) electron gases in high magnetic fields. Its striking manifestation is the quantization of the Hall conductance σxy in units of [formula]. Analogs of the IQHE are also known in systems with broken time reversal symmetry in which quasiparticle charge conservation is violated because of the presence of a charge condensate, while quasiparticle spin and energy remain conserved. In such a situation the Hall coefficients for spin or heat transport can exhibit plateaus at integer values in units of π [\cite=senthil99] or πk2B / 3 [\cite=senthil00] [\cite=vishwanath01], respectively. These novel types of quantum Hall effects may be encountered in superconducting systems with unconventional (non-s-wave) pairing. There has been a great deal of recent interest in these spin and thermal quantum Hall effects (SQHE and TQHE) [\cite=bundschuh99] [\cite=gruzberg99] [\cite=beamond] [\cite=kagalovsky] [\cite=senthil99] [\cite=mirlin] [\cite=senthil00] [\cite=vishwanath01]. In particular, the TQHE [\cite=chalker01] in systems without spin conservation, which belongs to class D in the Altland-Zirnbauer scheme [\cite=altland], displays many peculiar features that are not found in the IQHE or SQHE, including a metallic phase with a logarithmically diverging density of states (DoS) [\cite=senthil00] [\cite=bocquet00]. More generally, behavior of the DoS in unconventional disordered superconductors has attracted a lot of research interest recently [\cite=hirschfeld02]. A wealth of different types of low-energy behavior of the DoS was identified, depending on the symmetry of the system and on the type of disorder.

In a recent study of the Random Bond Ising model (RBIM) (which falls in the same universality class as the TQHE systems), Gruzberg et al. [\cite=gruzberg01] conjectured that such systems may have Hall insulating phases supporting a region where the DoS exhibits a power law singularity [formula] with a nonuniversal exponent z. Strong-disorder renormalization group (RG) calculations of Motrunich et al. [\cite=motrunich01] have also demonstrated the presence of such low E divergence in the DoS (with z  >  1) in quasi-1d superconductors with broken time reversal and spin rotation invariance. This has also been confirmed by calculations using a Fokker-Planck approach [\cite=gruzberg02]. The strong-disorder RG calculations make it apparent that the DoS divergence originates in this and in other 1d models [\cite=damle02] from Griffiths effects [\cite=griffiths69] involving exponentially rare length [formula] regions (occuring with probability [formula]) of the sample in 'nearby' phases. An exponentially weak coupling, [formula], of defects at the boundaries of such rare regions produces a power-law tail in the low energy DoS:

[formula]

(z  =  c / c' and c,c' are non universal parameters). Motrunich et al. further speculated [\cite=motrunich01] [\cite=motrunich02] that a similar mechanism driving a divergent DoS may be operative also in 2d superconductors.

The presence of such a regime with divergent DoS is in sharp contrast to the situation in standard Wigner-Dyson ensembles, where the DoS is never divergent. In 2d power law divergences generically modified by logarithmic corrections have been known to exist in the chiral symmetry classes  [\cite=gade93] [\cite=ludwig94] [\cite=mudry03] [\cite=motrunich02], where they appear in critical phases without exponential localization of the wavefunctions. Here, we report an observation of an insulating Griffiths phase with power-law singularities in the DoS of a model (RBIM) in the TQHE universality class. We further demonstrate that the divergent DoS is governed by a mechanism involving the presence of rare long string defects [\cite=foot1]. Our numerical results thus show that TQHE - in contrast to its close relatives, the IQHE and the SQHE - does exhibit the conjectured Griffiths phase [\cite=gruzberg01] [\cite=motrunich01].

For our numerical simulations we choose a particular network realization of the ±  J RBIM. As we discuss in the end of the paper, our results are however not restricted to this model but rather are generally valid for TQHE systems. The RBIM network realization is defined on a square lattice and has been described in detail before [\cite=chalker01]. Particles traversing the links of the network change direction and turn left or right with probability amplitudes ±   cos α or ±   sin α whenever arriving at a node. (The respective signs are fixed by the condition of unitarity of the corresponding time evolution operator.) Disorder in the form of "vortex pairs" is introduced by flipping the sign of both cos α amplitudes of the node that is dressed by the vortex pair. The system is characterized by two parameters: the inter-plaquette coupling strength, tl  =   sin 2α related to the temperature T and coupling constant J of the Ising model as tl  =   cosh - 22J / T, and the concentration of defects, p. Note that although the inter-plaquette hopping amplitudes are very different from the intra-plaquette amplitudes, the underlying spin model has no explicit dimerization in its couplings. Fig. [\ref=f1] shows the phase diagram of the model. It contains two localized phases corresponding to the ferro- and paramagnetic phases of the RBIM. The precise location of the phase transition line (the thermal quantum Hall transition in the fermionic formulation) has been studied in Ref. [\cite=merz01]. We also show in Fig. [\ref=f1] the Nishimori line (NL), where the RBIM possesses some additional symmetry.

We construct the time evolution operator U for a single time step for networks with periodic boundary conditions and use standard sparse matrix packages to extract a number of eigenvalues closest to zero [\cite=arpack]. Typically 8 to 16 eigenvalues per system are calculated. Since U is unitary and the network is class D, the eigenvalues come in pairs and are of the form exp ( ±   iE). We obtain the density of (pseudo)-energies, ρ(E), from an average over an ensemble of disorder realizations which contains typically of the order of 104 members.

We start the presentation of our numerical results with a scan along the line p = 0.08, as shown in Fig. [\ref=f1]. The scan begins in the high-T (paramagnetic) phase where the impact of a small concentration of vortex disorder is relatively weak. Here, one expects the energy gap that exists in the clean limit (p  =  0) to dominate because the particles have an appreciable tendency to wind about those plaquettes of the sublattice that are defect free. A non-zero DoS near zero energy is only due to very rare configurations of vortices giving rise to a "Lifshitz tail " [\cite=liftshitz], ln ρ(E)  ~  E- 2, see top panel of Fig. [\ref=f2] that turn the true gap of the clean system into a "pseudo-gap".

At lower values of the interplaquette coupling, tl  ≈  0.29, i.e. right on the phase boundary, the shape of the DoS is more complicated. In the absence of disorder, the DoS is linear, [formula], at the Ising critical point. In a disordered system, the theory of Dirac fermions with a random mass predicts a logarithmic correction to the low-energy behavior, [formula] [\cite=bocquet00]. Indeed our data for not too high E are consistent with this form, see bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=f2] (at higher energies model-specific band structure effects become important). Small deviations from this formula at very low energies can be attributed to finite-size effects, which are particularly pronounced at criticality.

If we diminish the inter-plaquette coupling strength so as to get close to the NL (still keeping p = 0.08 constant), we witness a qualitative change in the low-energy DoS: the pseudo-gap vanishes and the DoS starts to increase with lowering E, apparently diverging as E  →  0. This is demonstrated in Fig. [\ref=f3], where the evolution of DoS is shown as tl is lowered from 0.13 down to 0.014. For large enough inter-plaquette coupling one still notices the pseudo-gap behavior. The latter is already less evident in the data that corresponds to the coupling strength tl = 0.07. It finally gives way to a strongly increasing behavior once the coupling falls below tl  ≈  0.05.

Having demonstrated the divergence of the DoS in the low-temperature part of the ferromagnetic phase, we turn to a discussion of the corresponding mechanism. We will show that the DoS singularity is governed by rare disorder configurations containing long chains (strings) of defects. Since each defect contains a pair of vortices, such a string of a length [formula] (formed with a small but non-zero probability [formula]) produces two vortices with a large separation [formula]. At zero plaquette coupling, tl = 0, every vortex contributes a zero mode (or "mid-gap state") to the spectrum which therefore has a macroscopic degeneracy pL2. Upon switching on the coupling tl, the zero modes couple and the degeneracy is lifted. For a small tl, the energy splitting E thus produced will be exponentially small in l [\cite=read0]. For a clean system (which contains only two vortices at the ends of the string but no other defects) this follows immediately from the perturbation theory, yielding [formula]. Clearly, the same result holds for those rare configurations of the disordered system for which the region of a size [formula] around the vortex pair is free of other vortices. However, the probability for this to happen scales with [formula] as [formula], where d = 2 is the spatial dimensionality. In the 1d case this factor is harmless, yielding the probability for formation of an isolated string [formula] with c' =  -  ln p(1 - p)2 and Eq. [\ref=e1] applies. On the other hand, in d = 2 the above factor seems to spoil the reasoning leading to Eq. ([\ref=e1]). So, if the requirement of "isolation" of the vortex pair would be a necessary condition for the appearance of exponentially small eigenvalues, [formula], the divergent behavior of the DoS would be converted to a pseudo-gap at lowest energies due to the [formula] factor.

We now argue that this requirement is not necessary, and Eq. ([\ref=e1]) is applicable in 2d as well. Indeed, at small p almost all randomly located defects will be isolated. Correspondingly, ≃p is the concentration of vortex pairs with separation unity and an energy splitting ~  t1 / 2l. There will be a much smaller concentration (p2) of defects forming chains of length two, yielding the energy splitting ~  tl, and so forth. the energy splitting associated with these short (compared to [formula]) vortices will be relatively big, and will only weakly affect the energy splitting [formula] of the [formula]-vortex. This argument can be converted to a RG procedure, as in [\cite=motrunich01] [\cite=motrunich02]. The vortices can be sorted into vortex pairs by combining those with the shortest distance first, the second shortest distance next, etc. Since the energy splitting associated with the coupling of two vortices is exponential in their distance, vortex pairs differing in this distance will strongly differ in their splitting as well. The hierarchical order allows for a RG procedure that successively eliminates vortex pairs with an energy splitting that is large as compared to the pairs remaining on the lattice. Clearly, for sufficiently small tl and p (the boundary of the Griffiths phase will be discussed below) the eigenvalues associated with long strings, i.e. vortex pairs with a large separation, are (largely) insensitive to the presence of other vortex pairs. In other words, a string of length [formula] does not have to be isolated in order to contribute an eigenvalue [formula]. The only role of other (randomly distributed) vortices will be in somewhat modifying the parameter c as compared to its value [formula] for an isolated string.

Since the validity of the above RG-type argument is crucial for the proposed string mechanism, we have performed a numerical test for its verification. We have inserted a string of the length [formula] (ranging from 8 to 56) into a disordered network with tl = 0.029 and p = 0.08. Fig. [\ref=f4] displays the evolution of the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue with increasing length of the string. The results fully confirm our scenario: a) the extra string gives rise to an additional, isolated eigenvalue; b) this eigenvalue moves with increasing l according to the expected exponential law, [formula], see inset of Fig. [\ref=f4] (the rest of the spectrum does not move). We have performed the same calculation in the paramagnetic phase (p = 0.2, tl = 0.029) and found that the distribution does not move with [formula]: a long string of defects in a random environment does not generate an exponentially small eigenvalue.

Therefore, the analytical arguments together with the numerical results, Figs. [\ref=f3] and [\ref=f4], demonstrate the existence of a Griffiths phase where string formation generates a divergent DoS, Eq. ([\ref=e1]) with z > 1. This phase is shaded in the phase diagram, Fig. [\ref=f1]. Its boundary on the side of larger tl is given by the condition z = 1 and, according to our numerical results, is at least close to the NL. The asymptotic behavior of the boundary at low temperature and weak disorder can be easily found from our analytical considerations. Indeed, in this limit [formula], and c' =  -  ln p, so that the condition z = c / c' = 1 reduces to ln p≃ - 2J / T. This agrees with the low-temperature asymptotics of the NL, whose exact form is e2J / T = p / (1 - p). It is thus plausible that the boundary of the Griffiths phase with divergent DoS in fact coincides with the NL as was conjectured in [\cite=gruzberg01].

The boundary at large disorder is set by the phase transition line into the paramagnetic phase, where the string mechanism ceases to be operative. Indeed, our numerics indicates pseudogap formation everywhere in the paramagnetic phase. Right at this part of the phase boundary (between the Nishimori point N and the percolation critical point Pc), we find a divergent DoS with a non-universal exponent z, Fig. [\ref=f5]. While we do not have at present an analytical theory for this behavior of DoS at criticality, an analogy with the random phase XY model, which has a phase diagram remarkably similar to Fig. [\ref=f1], with a low-T part of the phase diagram requiring a strong-disorder RG treatment, [\cite=carpentier99] might be instructive.

In conclusion, we have reported the observation of a novel type of insulating phase for 2d electron systems that occurs in the TQHE characterized by a divergent density of states. Our numerical work is based on the network representation of the ±  J random bond Ising model. Preliminary results for the more generic Cho-Fisher [\cite=cho97] model confirm that a similar phase exists also there, so that the Griffiths phase is a ubiquitous companion of the TQHE.
