NEW SYMMETRY IN NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES

Introduction

A study of statistical and informational features of nucleotide sequences provides a researcher with powerful tool for investigations, and reveals some new issues in fundamental problems of molecular biology, genetics and evolution. Still, new patterns could be found in the genetic entities. Here we present such new pattern exhibiting quite unusual symmetry of the genomes.

Further, we shall consider the continuous sequences, only. A genetic entity is a symbol sequence from the four-letter alphabet [formula] with [formula] referring to adenine, [formula] referring to cytosine, [formula] referring to guanine, and [formula] referring to thymine. A study of unbound sequences is possible, while it brings no essential knowledge, but the technical difficulties.

Consider a nucleotide sequence of the length N. Any continuous subsequence ω, [formula] of the length q, 1  ≤  q  ≤  N makes a word; here [formula] is a nucleotide occupying the j-th position in it. Further, we shall consider the words of the length 3  ≤  q  ≤  8. A set of the (different) words of the length q occurred at a sequence is the support of that latter. Providing each element of the support (i.e., each word ω) with its frequency

[formula]

one gets the frequency dictionary Wq of the sequence; here nω is the number of copies of the word ω. Evidently, an information contained in a frequency dictionary Wl is entirely contained at the frequency dictionary Wq, as q  >  l.

An idea to seek for the overrepresented, or, on the contrary, underrepresented strings within a nucleotide sequence is not so new [\cite=ol1] [\cite=ol2] [\cite=ol3] [\cite=ol4]. The problem arises as one faces the problem of what is an overrepresentation (or the underrepresentation, in turn) of a string.

A word [formula] was considered to be an overrepresented one, if the number of its copies just exceeded some given number [formula]. Such approach fails to take into account a structure of a sequence. Indeed, if a sequence is rather degenerated, with the greatest majority of (possible) words from the given alphabet exhibiting a zero frequency, then few words show a great abundance within a sequence, while this abundance seems to be quite natural; one has no way to figure out a word of the increased frequency.

Expected frequency of a word

The method for the estimation of a word frequency taking into account the structure of a sequence was proposed in [\cite=n1] [\cite=n2] [\cite=n3]; later, it has been reproduced in [\cite=kitai]. The method estimates a word frequency [formula] through the calculation of the most probable continuation of a shorter word ω' embedded into the given one. A word ω of the length q could be composed from a couple of words ω' and ω'' of the length q - 1: [formula], so that [formula] yields the word [formula] of the length q - 2 occupying the central part of ω.

Such combinations must meet the following linear constraints: combination [formula] must produce the frequency dictionary Ŵq, that yields the real frequency dictionary Wq - 1 upon the downward conversion. This linear constraint eliminates a part of possible combinations, but the diversity of these latter is still great enough. The diversity of combinations results from an ambiguity of continuations of a shorter word met within a sequence, in general. Thus, one has to figure out a single frequency dictionary [formula] from the family [formula]. It seems rather natural to take into consideration the dictionary [formula] bearing the most probable continuations of the words of the length q - 1. The entity is identified due to entropy [formula]; the dictionary bearing the most probable continuations has the maximal entropy within the family [formula].

This extremal principle provides a researcher with the explicit formula for the expected frequency: for the case of q = 2. Formula ([\ref=vosf-q]) seems to be similar to the formula of Markov process transition probability. Nevertheless, the formulae ([\ref=vosfr]) are developed for a sequence, which is not hypothesized for being a random Markov process. Formulae ([\ref=vosfr]) mean that the Markov process (of the corresponding order) realizes the hypothesis of the most probable continuation of a word. The formulae ([\ref=vosfr]) could be generalized for the case of reconstruction of the dictionary [formula] over the original dictionary Wl, with l  <  q - 1, while we shall not consider that case. Everywhere below the reconstruction of [formula] over Wq - 1.

Information valuable words

The information valuable words are the strings with significant deviation of the real frequency from the expected one. Such strings contribute an information capacity of a frequency dictionary most of all [\cite=s1-1] [\cite=s1-2]. The information capacity is defined as a mutual entropy of the given dictionary Wq calculated with respect to the reconstructed one [formula]. Such definition holds true, since the reconstructed frequency dictionary [formula] bears the same words, as the real one Wq does, and, maybe, some strings else.

The informal definition should be replaced with more strict and rigorous: a string [formula] is the information valuable word, if it falls out of the range determined by the double inequality

[formula]

Here 0 <   <  1 and [formula] are the upper and lower information value threshold, respectively. The motivation behind such definition of information valuable word is clear and obvious. An expected frequency [formula] determined according to ([\ref=vosfr]) meets the following constraint: [formula], if fω > 0, for any ω. Thus, the definition ([\ref=alf]) is correct.

Whether a word ω is of information value, or not, depends strongly on the choice of the threshold. In general, the choice is to be done with respect to a variety of issues, including the specific targets of a study. Thus, the choice of α could be done in various ways, and there is no single natural method to identify that latter. The problem could be addressed studying a distribution of the words over their information value [formula]; Table [\ref=T3] shows such distribution for q = 3, for a dozen of bacterial genomes (all the entities are deposited at EMBL-bank, ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes): 1 - Deinococcus radiodurans, chromosome I (identifier AE000513); 2 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551 (identifier AE000516); 3 - Treponema pallidum (identifier AE000520); 4 - Borrelia burgdorferi B31 (identifier AE000783); 5 - Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW-3/CX (identifier AE001273); 6 - Deinococcus radiodurans, chromosome II (identifier AE001825); 7 - Chlamydophila pneumoniae AR39 (identifier AE002161); 8 - Vibrio cholerae O1, chromosome I (identifier AE003852); 9 - Vibrio cholerae O1, chromosome II (identifier AE003853); 10 - Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 (identifier AE007317); 11 - Ureaplasma parvum (identifier AF222894); and 12 - Bacillus str. 168 (identifier AL009126).

Thicker dictionary could hardly be shown as a table, since the abundance of the words grows exponentially. Nevertheless, not discussing here the problem of the threshold choice in detail, further we shall consider the words exhibiting the greatest possible (within a dictionary Wq), or the lowest possible information value pω, [formula]. Surely, the threshold depends on the dictionary thickness q, as well.

Symmetry in genomes

Genomes of organisms exhibit a symmetry in information valuable words. These latter are the complementary palindromes. A string, that could be read equally both forward, and back, is a palindrome. Two words make the complementary palindrome, if the latter is read equally to the former, upon the complementary replacement of the nucleotides, according to the complementary rule

[formula]

Following is an example of such complementary palindrome of the length q = 8:

[formula]

This is a real complementary palindrome observed at the B.subtilis genome. The information value of the words is [formula], and [formula], respectively.

Consider Table [\ref=T3] in more detail. It is evident, that the triplets with the highest information value p make the couples of complementary palindromes. Indeed, these are the couples [formula] for the entities # 1, 3 and 6. The palindrome [formula] exhibits the increased level of p for the entities # 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 11; etc. Similar pattern is observed for the triplets with p  <  α- 1: the complementary palindrome [formula] is observed the entities 1 through 3, the palindrome [formula] is observed in the entities 1 and 2, the couple of triplets [formula] makes the pattern under discussion for the entities 1 and 6, and so on.

For each word ω at the dictionary Wq the information value [formula] could be determined. An excess of the valued over the information threshold α makes a word to an information valuable one. Since the determination of the information valuable words depends on the threshold α, further we shall omit this problem through the consideration of the ultimate valued of pω, only. The words within a dictionary could be arranged in descending order, and the words with the highest (or the lowest one, in turn) possible value of pω would be considered. Table [\ref=T1] shows the trinucleotide complementary palindromes observed in several eukaryotic genomes. The pattern similar to that one shown in Table [\ref=T1] could be observed in any genome.

Longer words exhibit the same pattern in a duality, as their information value exceeds the threshold. We shall consider Escherichia coli K-12 complete genome to see the issue. To begin with, let us consider the complementary palindromic triplets; Table [\ref=eck12-3] shows the palindromes, and the information value [formula] of the words. The complementary palindromes of the length q = 4 and q = 5 are shown in Table [\ref=eck12-4]. There are two perfect palindromes of the length q = 4:

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula], respectively. A word [formula] is the perfect palindrome, if it coincides to itself after the complementary palindromic transformation. Again, it should be stressed, that the complementary palindromes of these lengths are identified for the ultimate score (upper or lower one) of the information value.

There are a good few perfect complementary palindromes of the length q = 6. The hexanucleotides of the ultimate information value (from both sides of the distribution) are the entities of that type:

[formula]

Surprisingly, the perfect complementary palindromes occupy the leading positions, with respect to the information value of words observed in this genome at q = 6.

Complementary palindromes of the length q = 7 and q = 8 exhibit more sporadic behavior. First of all, a lesser part of the information valuable words of that lengths meet a counter word making a complementary palindrome: some words have no palindromic couple. Meanwhile, there are 246 complementary palindromes among the information valuable words of the length q = 7 with p  >  1; the abundance of the set of these latter exceeds seven hundred strings. Similarly, the abundance of the information valuable words with p  <  1 is more, than nine hundred of strings, while the total number of complementary palindromes among them is equal to 456 ones. Five highly ranked complementary palindromes of the length q = 7 with pω  >  1, and similar palindromes with pω  <  1 are shown in Table [\ref=T-eck12-7].

Besides, the complementary palindromes of these lengths exhibit an inversion. It means, that a couple of words may consist of the strings with opposite ration of real and expected frequency. There are twelve inverse complementary palindromes of the length q = 7; Table [\ref=T-eck12-7] shows them, as well.

The complementary palindromes of the length q = 8 are quite abundant. There is a single word [formula], which is the perfect complementary palindrome; it has the information value p  =  0.07813. Table [\ref=T-eck12-8] shows complementary palindromes of this length, occupying the ultimate positions in the word distribution over the information value. It should be said, that two words [formula] and [formula] exhibiting the information value p = 5.75000 and p = 5.57333, respectively, have no counterword among the information valuable ones.

To validate the data presented in Tables [\ref=T1], [\ref=eck12-3], [\ref=eck12-4], [\ref=T-eck12-7] and [\ref=T-eck12-8], we show the parameters of the relevant distributions of the words of the length 3  ≤  q  ≤  8 observed for the E.coli K-12 complete genome. Table [\ref=Ec-par] shows the following parameters of the words distribution over their information value: pM (pm, respectively) is the largest information value (the lowest one, respectively) observed within a distribution, [formula] is a mean information value of the dictionary, σ is the standard deviation of the distribution, finally, μ and ε are the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution, respectively. It is evident, that the complementary palindromes shown above occupy indeed the polar positions at the distributions.

A study of longer information valuable words is possible, as well, while we shall not consider them. The growth of the length of words yields a decay of a set of information valuable words [\cite=s1-1] [\cite=s1-2]. For any nucleotide sequence, there exists the specific thickness of a dictionary Wq (denoted as [formula]), that results in a zero value of information capacity of the dictionary, and, in turn, in a total absence of a word with information value p  ≠  1.

Discussion

The pattern revealed in nucleotide sequences and presented here is absolutely new, universal, and intriguing. Some issues concerning this new symmetry pattern are obvious, some are not. Evidently, the pattern could be observed over the sequences with an alphabet with even number of symbols. Indeed, the pattern could not be met in sequences from an odd number of symbols alphabet, since there is now á priori preference for a symbol, which must be excluded from the pattern formation. Of course, a student may face such situation in some system based on symbol sequence, say, natural language with alphabetic writing system; meanwhile, we shall not consider such cases here.

Next, the most intriguing thing here is, that the pattern is observed at the dictionaries developed over a single strand of DNA sequence. Since the discovery of the double helix of DNA by J.Watson and F.Crick, the complementary rule becomes a common place and is introduced into the secondary school programs. Here we observe the pattern through the analysis of a single strand developed frequency dictionary, and such strand "knows nothing" about the existence of the opposite one.

Surely, the observed pattern of a complementary palindromic symmetry is peculiar for rather complicated and non-random sequences. Here a question arises towards a primacy of the patterns under consideration: whether a double helix is of a primary nature, or the statistically based complementarity of nucleotides. Nothing is known exactly towards this point. Evidently, the comprehensive answer on this problem is somewhere in between. It is quite natural to expect, that these two patterns (i.e., doubling of DNA with complementarity between the nucleotides, and palindrome symmetry) result from a co-evolution of a system of inheritance storage, transfer and processing.

Preliminary, we have studied more, than thirty genomes of bacteria, and seven eukaryotic genomes. There was no entity among them, that did not manifest the complementary palindromic symmetry. This phenomenon is universal, and the exclusions (if any) are of the greatest scientific interest. Some information valuable words fall out of the phenomenon, as the length q grows up. One may say, that the stability of the observed symmetry decays, as the thickness q of a dictionary grows up. Meanwhile, the phenomenon seems to be very stable, for the dictionaries of the thickness q = 3 and q = 4. Such stability is peculiar for rather long genomes, at least. Indeed, the data concerning the distribution of information valuable triplets observed for a family of phage and viral genomes [\cite=ms98] show the occurrence of the pattern, while the exclusions are more frequent.

The composition of the counterwords composing complementary palindromes is of great interest, itself. Various genomes exhibit different words within the couples. Meanwhile, some words (especially, rather short ones, say, of the length q = 3 and q = 4) occur quite often, in various entities. A comparative study of such words may contribute significantly an investigation of evolutionary relations between the nucleotide sequences and their bearers.

Interspecies variation in complementary palindromic triplets is greater, in comparison to that on observed within a genome. A growth of the dictionary thickness q yields an expansion of a variety of complementary palindromes observed in different chromosomes of the same genome. The greater diversity of the sets of complementary palindromic triplets observed in a single chromosome genomes may follow from the taxonomy of these latter. Indeed, a single chromosome genomes are peculiar for prokaryotic organisms, while the multi-chromosomal ones are met in eukaryotic beings. Such great difference in organisation level of inherited matter may manifest in various ways, including the difference in complementary palindromic triplets (and quadruplets) composition.

The information valuable words themselves are known to be spread alongside a genome quite non-randomly, with significant preference to some peculiar segments of a genome [\cite=kitai] [\cite=dan]. A study of the dispersion of the counterwords composing complementary palindromes may reveal more specific occurrence pattern of such strings alongside a genome.
