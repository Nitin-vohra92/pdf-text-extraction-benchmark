This appendix to the beautiful paper [\cite=Ih] of Ihara puts it in the context of infinite global fields of our papers [\cite=Ts/Vl] and [\cite=Ts/Vl_FF]. We study the behaviour of Euler-Kronecker constant γK when the discriminant (genus in the function field case) tends to infinity. Results of [\cite=Ts/Vl] easily give us good lower bounds on the ratio [formula]. In particular, for number fields, under the generalized Riemann hypothesis we prove

Introduction

Let K be a global field, i.e., a finite algebraic extension either of the field [formula] of rational numbers, or of the field of rational functions in one variable over a finite field of constants. Let ζK(s) be its zeta-function. Consider its Laurent expansion at s = 1

[formula]

In [\cite=Ih] Yasutaka Ihara introduces and studies the constant

[formula]

There are several reasons to study it:

it generalizes the classical Euler constant [formula]

for imaginary quadratic fields it is expressed by a beautiful Kronecker limit formula;

for fields with large discriminants its absolute value is at most of the order of [formula], while the residue c- 1 itself may happen to be exponential in [formula], see [\cite=Ts/Vl].

In this appendix we study asymptotic behaviour of this constant when the discriminant (genus in the fuction field case) of the field tends to infinity. It is but natural to compare Ihara's results [\cite=Ih] with the methods of infinite zeta-functions developed in [\cite=Ts/Vl].

Let [formula] in the number field case and αK = (gK - 1) log q in the function field case over [formula]. In the number field case Ihara shows that

[formula]

We improve the lower bound to

[formula]

Remarks. Unconditionally we get [formula]

In the function field case using the same method we get [formula] which, of course, coincides with Theorem 2 of Ihara's paper [\cite=Ih].

Let us remark that the upper bound 0 is attained for any asymptotically bad family of global fields, and that the lower bound in the function field case is attained for any asymptotically optimal family (such that the ratio of the number of [formula]-points to the genus tends to [formula]), which we know to exist whenever q is a square. Hence, lim sup γK   /   αK = 0 and in the function field case with a square q, we have [formula].

cm In Section 3 we construct examples of class field towers proving (unconditionally)

cm Theorem 2.

[formula]

This slightly improves the examples given by Ihara in [\cite=Ih].

In the number field case set [formula] If we complete γK by archimedean terms, we get

cm Theorem 3. Let γ̃K  =  γK  +  βK. Then, under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we have

[formula]

It is much easier to see that lim sup γ̃K   /   αK  ≤  0, and that 0 is attained for any asymptotically bad family (i.e., such that all φ's vanish, see the definitions below).

The best example we know gives (unconditionally)

cm Theorem 4.

Bounds

Let us consider the asymptotic behaviour of γK. We treat the number field case (the same argument in the function field case leads to Theorem 2 of [\cite=Ih]). Let |dK| tend to infinity. By Lemma 2.2 of [\cite=Ts/Vl] any family of fields contains an asymptotically exact subfamily, i.e., such that for any q there exists the limit φq of the ratio of the number Φq(K) of prime ideals of norm q to the "genus" αK, and also the limits [formula] and [formula] of the ratios of r1 and r2 to αK. To find lim inf γK  /  αK and lim inf γ̃K  /  αK it is enough to find corresponding limits for a given asymptotically exact family, and then to look for their minimal values. In what follows we consider only asymptotically exact families.

cm Theorem 5. For an asymptotically exact family {K} we have

[formula]

where q runs over all prime powers.

cm Proof. The right-hand side equals ξ0φ(1), where ξ0φ(s) is the log-derivative of the infinite zeta-function ζφ(s) of [\cite=Ts/Vl]. The corresponding series converges for [formula] (Proposition 4.2 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]). We know ([\cite=Ih], (1.3.3) and (1.3.4)) that

[formula]

where for [formula]

[formula]

By the same Proposition 4.2, [formula] and hence γK  /  αK  →  ξ0φ(1).

cm Proof of Theorem 1. We have to maximize [formula] under the conditions:

φq  ≥  0;

for any prime p we have [formula];

[formula] (Basic Inequality, GRH-Theorem 3.1 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]).

If we put

[formula]

we are under conditions (1)-(4) and (i)-(iv) of Section 8 of [\cite=Ts/Vl].

Theorem 1 is now straightforward from Proposition 8.3 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]. Indeed, the maximum is attained for φpm = 0 for m  >  1, [formula] and [formula] (calculation shows that starting from p' = 11 the last inequality of Proposition 8.3 is violated).

cm Proof of Theorem 3. It is much easier. Since in this case all coefficients are positive and the ratio of the coefficient of the function we maximize to the corresponding coefficient of the Basic Inequality is maximal for [formula], the maximum is attained when all φ's vanish, except for [formula].

cm Remarks. If we want unconditional results, then instead of the Basic inequality we have to use Proposition 3.1 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]:

[formula]

For γ̃K  /  αK one easily gets

[formula]

The calculation for γK  /  αK is trickier, since the last condition of Proposition 8.3 of [\cite=Ts/Vl] is not violated until very large primes. Changing the coefficients by the first term (q  +  1)- 1, Zykin [\cite=Zy] gets

[formula]

Note that (for an asymptotically exact family) 1 + γ̃K  /  αK is just the value at 1 of the log-derivative ξ(s) of the completed infinite zeta-function (s) of [\cite=Ts/Vl].

Examples

Let us bound lim inf γK   /   αK from above. To do this one should provide some examples of families. The easiest is, just as in Section 9 of [\cite=Ts/Vl], to produce quadratic fields having infinite class field towers with prescribed splitting. The proof of Theorem 1 suggests that we should look for towers of totally complex fields, where 2, 3, 5 and 7 are totally split. This is however imprecise, because the sum of Proposition 8.3 varies only slightly when we change p0. Therefore, I also look at the cases when 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 are split, and when only 2, 3 and 5 are split, or even only 2 and 3. This leads to a slight improvement on (1.6.30) of [\cite=Ih].

Each of the following fields has an infinite 2-class field tower with prescribed splitting (just apply Theorem 9.1 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]), and Theorem 5 gives the following list.

For [formula] (the example of Thm.9.4 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]) [formula] 2, 3, 5, 7 totally split, we get [formula]

For [formula] (the example of Theorem 9.5 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]) with 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 split we get [formula]

For [formula] with 2, 3, 5 split we get [formula]

For [formula] with 2, 3, 5 split we get [formula]

An even better example is found by Zykin [\cite=Zy]: [formula] with 2 and 3 split gives us [formula] This proves Theorem 2.

For lim inf γ̃K   /   αK the Martinet field [formula] (see Theorem 9.2 of [\cite=Ts/Vl]) gives [formula] The best Hajir-Maire example (see [\cite=Ha/Ma], Section 3.2) gives [formula] This proves Theorem 4.

I am grateful to Professor Yasutaka Ihara for letting me know his results prior to publication and for a useful e-mail discussion, to my student Alexei Zykin for many fruitful discussions and for computer verification of my calculations, and to Don Zagier for several valuable remarks on the text.
