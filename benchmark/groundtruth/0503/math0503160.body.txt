Explicit formula for even-index Bernoulli numbers

Keywords: Number theory, Bernoulli numbers, non-recursive expression.

Explicit expression for even-index Bernoulli numbers.

First a sequence of determinants Dk (with k= 1, 2, 3, ...) is defined as follows:

D[formula]      D[formula]      D[formula]

D[formula]      etc

(1.1)

Let B2p (with p= 1, 2, 3, ) be the even Bernoulli number of index 2p.

B2p is then given by the following formula:

[formula]

(1.2)

in which the Dk's are as given above and 0 ! = 1 by definition.

Relation between the determinants Dk.

The determinants Dk in (1.1) are in explicit form. Nevertheless a recursive relation among the Dk's may be given as is obvious from their definition (1.1). Putting for simplicity D0 = 1, the relation between the Dk's may be written successively as:

D[formula] D0

D[formula] D[formula] D0

D[formula] D[formula] D[formula] D0

D[formula] D[formula] D[formula] D[formula] D0

or in general:

[formula]
