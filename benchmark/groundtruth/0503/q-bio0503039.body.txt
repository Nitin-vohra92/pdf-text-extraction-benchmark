Stochastic Differential Equation

Let us start from heat equation

[formula]

the solution is given by

[formula]

and corresponding stochastic differential equation is

[formula]

where Bt denotes Brownian motion. In case there is a drift term we have

[formula]

whose solution is

[formula]

where c is a velocity.

Let us modify the last equation to be

[formula]

where α is volatility. This equation can be integrated to be

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and applying Ito formula we obtain

[formula]

where let

[formula]

which represents averaged loss of energy, and this can be integrated to be

[formula]

This is the optimal structure of protein structure.1 It will be worth to note that eq.(1.6) includes perturbed drift as a result there is an underlying displacement.

Trading Strategy

Trading strategy is a concept in mathematical finance given by a twin of stochastic variables denoted by2 and provides a powerful tool in biology which is

[formula]

In this equation at and bt are given by as defined in the space of square integral function L2(Rn)

[formula]

and

[formula]

where r denotes interest ratio and βt is mean gain of entropy process of protein given by

[formula]

Using these notation of the portfolio, which is a twin of stochastic variable, is given by

[formula]

This provide the degree of free energy loss.

Adaptive Optimization

Let us consider a stochastic integral of optimal pricing w.r.t. trading strategy as follows

[formula]

If r.h.s. does not change pricing is called adoptive to trading strategy. This defines a martingale.3 This means that protein structure is globally optimized to trading strategy. This equation can be solved by iteration as follows.

in repeat until

[formula]

in continue

This provides an algorithm implementable into digital computer where the optimal structure adoptive to trading strategy in which l.h.s denotes a conditional probabilty. In this case, trading strategy needs not be self-balancing. It will be hoped to contribute protein folding whose importance is well recognized.4

Concluding remarks

Optimal folding for protein structure adoptive to trading strategy was formulated in terms of Ito type stochastic differential equation. It should be noted, however, that there is a limitation in present formulation that it rely on Brownian motion. As a result it depends on Gaussian process based on central limit theorem which states summation of independent variable is governed by Gaussian distribution. The shortcomings arises from the fact that variables are not independent in the real world. An attempt is under progress to incorporate correlation.
