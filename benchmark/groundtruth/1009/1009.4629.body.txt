A mean curvature estimate for cylindrically bounded submanifolds

Let ([formula] and (Pn,gP) be complete Riemannian manifolds of dimension [formula] and n, respectively, where [formula] is non compact. Then, let [formula] be the product manifold [formula] endowed with the warped product metric ds2 = dgL  +  ρ2dgP for some positive warping function ρ∈C∞(L).

Let BP(r0) denote the geodesic ball with radius r0 centered at a reference point o∈Pn. We assume that the radial sectional curvatures in BP(r0) along the geodesics issuing from o are bounded as [formula] for some constant [formula], and that [formula] where injP(o) is the injectivity radius at o and [formula] is replaced by +    ∞   if b  ≤  0. Then, the mean curvature of the geodesic sphere SP(r0) = ∂BP(r0) can be estimated from below by the mean curvature of a geodesic sphere of a space form of curvature b, namely,

[formula]

This is a direct consequence of the comparison theorems for the Riemannian distance, since the Hessian (respectively, Laplacian) of the distance function is nothing but the second fundamental form (respectively, mean curvature) of the geodesic spheres. A classical reference about this topic is [\cite=GW]. We also refer the reader to [\cite=Petersen] or [\cite=PRSbook] for a modern approach to the Hessian and Laplacian comparison theorems.

By a cylinder in the warped space [formula] we mean a closed subset of the form

[formula]

Since the submanifolds [formula] are totally geodesic, we have that

[formula]

where HCr0 is the mean curvature vector field of the hypersurface [formula].

The following theorem extends the result in [\cite=AlBeDa] where the cylinders under consideration are contained in product spaces [formula]. After the statement, we recall from [\cite=AlBeMoPi] the concept of an Omori-Yau pair on a Riemannian manifold and discuss some implications of its existence.

Let [formula] be an isometric immersion where [formula] carries an Omori-Yau pair for the Hessian and the functions ρ and | log ρ| are bounded. If f is proper and f(M)  ⊂  Cr0, then sup M|H| =  +   ∞   or

[formula]

where H is the mean curvature vector field of f.

In the proof we see that the existence in [formula] of a Omori-Yau pair for the Hessian provides conditions, in a function theoretic form, that guarantee the validity of the Omori-Yau Maximum Principle on Mm in terms of the corresponding property of [formula] and the geometry of the immersion.

Similarly, the pair (h,γ) forms an Omori-Yau pair for the Laplacian in M if they satisfy conditions (a) to (e) and

[formula] for some d > 0 outside a compact subset of M.

The following fundamental result due to Pigola, Rigoli and Setti [\cite=PiRiSe] gives sufficient conditions for an Omori-Yau Maximum Principle to hold for a Riemannian manifold.

Assume that a Riemannian manifold M carries an Omori-Yau pair for the Hessian (respec., Laplacian). Then, the Omori-Yau Maximum Principle for the Hessian (respec., Laplacian) holds in M.

Recall that the Omori-Yau Maximum Principle for the Hessian holds for M if for any function g∈C∞(M) bounded from above there exists a sequence of points [formula] in M such that

[formula],

|  g(pk)|  ≤  1 / k,

g(pk)(X,X)  ≤  (1 / k)gM(X,X) for all X∈TpkM.

Similarly, the Omori-Yau Maximum Principle for the Laplacian holds for M if the above properties are satisfied with (c) replaced by

Δg(pk)  ≤  1 / k.

Let Mm be a complete but non compact Riemannian manifold and denote r(y) = M(y,o) for some reference point o∈Mm. Assume that the radial sectional curvature of Mm satisfies [formula], where the smooth function h satisfies (a) to (c) in Definition [\ref=def] and is even at the origin, that is, h(2k + 1)(0) = 0 for [formula]. Then, it was shown in [\cite=PiRiSe] that the functions (h,r2) form an Omori-Yau pair for the Hessian. As for the function h, one can choose

[formula]

where log (j) stands for the j-th iterated logarithm.

To conclude this section, we first observe that Theorem [\ref=main] is sharp. This is clear from ([\ref=four]) by taking as Pn a space-form and as M the hypersurface [formula] in [formula]. Moreover, in view of Example [\ref=two] it follows taking [formula] and constant ρ that we recover the result in [\cite=AlBeDa].

The proof

We first introduce some additional notations and then we recall a few basic facts on warped product manifolds.

Let 〈  ,  〉 denote the metrics in [formula], [formula] and Mm whereas (  ,  ) stands for the metric in Pn. The corresponding norms are |    | and [formula]. In addition, let [formula] and [formula] denote the Levi-Civita connections in Mm and [formula], respectively, and [formula] and [formula] the ones in [formula] and Pn.

We always denote vector fields in TL by T,S and in TP by X,Y. In addition, we identify vector fields in TL and TP with basic vector fields in TN by taking T(x,y) = T(x) and X(x,y) = X(y).

For the Lie-brackets of basic vector fields, we have that ∈TL and ∈TP are basic and that = 0. Then, we have

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where the vector fields X,Y and T are basic and ϱ  =   log ρ.

Our proof follows the main steps in [\cite=AlBeMoPi], where the geometric situation considered differs from ours since there f(M) is contained in a cylinder of the form

[formula]

In fact, a substantial part of the argument is to show that the Omori-Yau pair for the Hessian in [formula] induces an Omori-Yau pair for the Laplacian for a non compact Mm when |H| is bounded. Thus, the Omori-Yau Maximum Principle for the Laplacian holds in Mm, and the proof follows from a application of the latter.

Suppose that Mm is non compact and let (h,Γ) be an Omori-Yau pair for the Hessian in [formula]. For p∈Mm denote f(p) = (x(p),y(p)). Set Γ̃(x,y) = Γ(x) for [formula] and

[formula]

We show next that (h,γ) is an Omori-Yau pair for the Laplacian in Mm. First, we argue that the function γ is proper. To see this, let pk∈Mm be a divergent sequence, i.e., pk  →    ∞   in Mm as k  →    +    ∞  . Thus, f(pk)  →    ∞   in [formula] since f is proper. Since f(M) lies inside a cylinder, then x(pk)  →    ∞   in [formula]. Hence, γ(pk)  →    +    ∞   as k  →    +    ∞   since Γ is proper, and thus γ is proper.

It remains to verify conditions (e) and (f') in Definition [\ref=def]. We have from Γ̃(x,y) = Γ(x) that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Since [formula], we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] denotes taking the normal component to f. Then,

[formula]

outside a compact subset of Mm, and thus (e) holds.

We have that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

For a unit vector e∈TpM, set e = eL + eP where eL∈Tx(p)L and eP∈Ty(p)P. Then,

[formula]

Moreover, an easy computation using ([\ref=six]) yields

[formula]

where α denotes the second fundamental of f with values in the normal bundle. Thus,

[formula]

Since [formula] for some positive constant d outside a compact subset of [formula] and the immersion is proper, then

[formula]

outside a compact subset of Mm. From [formula] for some c outside a compact subset of [formula] and sup L|Lϱ| <  +   ∞  , we have

[formula]

for some positive constant c' outside a compact subset of Mm. Being γ proper and h unbounded from (a) and (b) in Definition [\ref=def], then

[formula]

outside a compact subset of Mm, since γ  →    +    ∞   as p  →    ∞   and lim t  →    +    ∞h(t) =  +   ∞  . Thus, we obtain

[formula]

for same constant d1 > 0, outside a compact subset of Mm.

On the other hand, we may assume that

[formula]

for some constant c > 0, outside a compact subset of Mm. Otherwise, there exists a sequence [formula] in Mm such that pk  →    ∞   as k  →    +    ∞   and

[formula]

Being γ proper and h unbounded from (a) and (b) in Definition [\ref=def], we conclude that sup M|H| =  +   ∞  , in which case we are done with the proof of the theorem.

We obtain from ([\ref=nine]) using ([\ref=three]) that

[formula]

for some constant c1 > 0 outside a compact subset of Mm, and thus (f') has been proved.

Consider the distance function r(y) = P(y,o) in BP(r0) and define ∈C∞(N) by (x,y) = r(y). Then,

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

We obtain that

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Moreover,

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

For e∈TM, we have

[formula]

From the Hessian comparison theorem (cf. Chapter 2 in [\cite=PRSbook] for a modern approach), we obtain

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

We define u∈C∞(M) by

[formula]

Thus, [formula] and

[formula]

Using ([\ref=one]) gives

[formula]

where [formula] an orthonormal frame of TM. Thus,

[formula]

We have from ej = eLj + ePj that

[formula]

where [formula] is an orthonormal frame for TL. Hence,

[formula]

where [formula] is the tangent component of T. We obtain that

[formula]

We obtain from ([\ref=ten]) and

[formula]

that

[formula]

Taking trace and using ([\ref=seven]) gives

[formula]

Since

[formula]

we have

[formula]

We conclude using ([\ref=twelve]) that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

If Mm is compact, the proof follows easily by computing the inequality at a point of maximum of u. Thus, we may now assume that Mm is non compact and that ([\ref=three]) holds.

Since f(M)  ⊂  Cr0, we have u*  =   sup Mu  ≤  r0 <  +   ∞  . By the Omori-Yau maximum principle there is a sequence [formula] in Mm such that

[formula]

By assumption, we have sup Lρ = K1 <  +   ∞   and sup L|Lϱ| = K2 <  +   ∞  . Hence,

[formula]

Letting k  →    +    ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

and this concludes the proof of the theorem.
