The thermodynamic evolution of the cosmological event horizon

Introduction

Following from the seminal work of Gibbons and Hawking [\cite=GH1977], a generalized prescription has been developed to describe the thermodynamic properties of both cosmological event horizons and the event horizons of black holes, for a broad class of static metrics of the form

[formula]

given in the usual notation and in Planck units, which are used throughout this work [\cite=Pad2002], [\cite=Pad2005]. The radial function f = f(r) determines the characteristics of the corresponding spacetime. Each finite, positive radial coordinate r = Rj that is a simple solution of f(r) = 0 coincides with a spherical event horizon. The surface gravity κj on the j-th horizon is given by

[formula]

and the temperature Tj and entropy Sj of the horizon are, respectively, [\cite=Pad2002], [\cite=Pad2005]

[formula]

and

[formula]

Event horizons in static spacetimes are generally subject to a thermodynamic rule that is analogous to the conventional Clausius relation. Consider a large conventional system, with temperature T, entropy S and pressure p, occupying a spatial volume V that contains a total energy E. Suppose that the system is subject to an infinitesimal thermodynamic transition during which S, E and V are allowed to evolve freely. From the First Law of Thermodynamics (FLT), we have

[formula]

Suppose, alternatively, that an infinitesimal, reversible transfer of heat between the system and the adjacent environment occurs, thereby changing E by some quantity δ Q. It follows from Eq.([\ref=EqFLT]), with d V = 0, that the corresponding infinitesimal change δ S in the entropy is given by

[formula]

which is the relationship by which Clausius defined entropy.

Now let us consider a system consisting of a spherical causal horizon with proper radius R, entropy S and temperature T. Suppose that, as the consequence of a natural thermodynamic fluctuation, an infinitesimal quantity of energy crosses the horizon, changing the total enclosed energy E by δ E. Let the fluctuation transpire rapidly enough to ensure that R, E and S remain approximately constant but for the effects of the fluctuation. As such, the horizon is quasi-stationary with respect to the fluctuation and is therefore subject to the cosmological analogue of the conventional Clausius relation. Specifically, the FLT for stationary event horizons specifies that [\cite=Cai2002a], [\cite=Cai2002b]

[formula]

In the case of a stationary black hole horizon, the appropriate form of the FLT would be Tδ S≃δ E. The reversal of the sign of δ E in Eq.([\ref=EqFLTsch]) with respect to the conventional Clausius relation represents an important physical distinction between cosmological horizons and most other thermodynamic systems. Whereas the entropy of a stationary black hole increases as the enclosed energy increases, the entropy of a cosmological event horizon in a static spacetime increases as the enclosed energy decreases and the energy of the exterior region increases [\cite=GH1977].

An instructive example is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) metric, which is of the form Eq.([\ref=EqM1]) with f equal to

[formula]

where m is the mass of the centrally located spherical body, nominally representing a black hole, and Λ is the cosmological constant. The two non-negative solutions of fdS(r) = 0, defined here as R1 and R2, correspond respectively to the black hole event horizon and the cosmological event horizon (CEH). Note that R1 is never larger than R2. As Λ vanishes, R1 approaches the usual Schwarzschild radius 2m. Conversely, as m vanishes R2 approaches the de Sitter radius

[formula]

If m  ≪  RΛ then

[formula]

and the corresponding entropy and temperature are, respectively,

[formula]

and

[formula]

The dS entropy and temperature are recovered from Eqs.([\ref=EqS2]) and ([\ref=EqT2]) by putting m = 0. Suppose that some quantity δ m of energy were to escape from the central mass and migrate across the CEH. According to Eq.([\ref=EqFLTsch]), with T2 given by Eq.([\ref=EqT2]), the corresponding variation δ S2 must be

[formula]

which is consistent with the result obtained directly by varying m in Eq.([\ref=EqS2]) [\cite=GH1977].

The thermodynamic properties of stationary horizons originate ultimately in the field equations of general relativity [\cite=Jac2003]. Insofar as the field equations are inherently thermodynamic, it is reasonable to expect that the basic thermodynamic behaviors attributed to stationary horizons should manifest generally, though perhaps in varying forms, in all relativistic causal horizons, including cosmological horizons associated with dynamical spacetimes. In principle we may probe the thermodynamic behaviors of a given dynamical horizon by analyzing the response of the horizon to an infinitesimal fluctuation in some system parameter. Moreover, it is generally possible to consider a fluctuation that occurs rapidly, such that the horizon is quasi-stationary with respect to the fluctuation. In that manner we may determine the temperature of a dynamical horizon. Specifically, if the horizon entropy varies by some quantity δ S in response to an infinitesimal change δ E in the enclosed energy, which transpires rapidly while such that the horizon is quasi-stationary, then the temperature of the horizon should be given by δ E / δ S in accordance with Eq.([\ref=EqFLTsch]).

The cosmological apparent horizon (CAH) in a FRW universe is a centrally important example of a dynamical horizon whose temperature may be determined according to the prescription described in the previous paragraph [\cite=AC2007], [\cite=CK2005]. Consider a spacetime characterized by the FRW metric, which may be expressed as

[formula]

where t is the proper time, a is the cosmic scale factor and k is the curvature parameter. At any given moment there exists a cosmological apparent horizon (CAH) whose proper radius Ra is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the Hubble parameter, with the overdot signifying d   /  d t. The total energy contained in the volume Va enclosed by the CAH is Ea  =  ρVa, and its full differential is therefore d Ea  =  d Vaρ  +  Vad ρ.

In order to determine the temperature of the CAH we may introduce a uniform fluctuation δ ρ such that the usual average cosmic background density at some arbitrary proper time tv becomes ρ(tv)  +  δ ρ. Let the fluctuation arise within some vanishing interval

[formula]

The dynamical temperature of the cosmological event horizon

Consider a spacetime characterized by a metric of the form Eq.([\ref=EqFRW]) which contains an ideal fluid consisting of relativistic, radiation-like particles and cold, dust-like matter. Let the spacetime be also endowed with a positive cosmological constant. The total density at any given time may be therefore itemized according to

[formula]

where ε, μ and ν represent respectively the contributions from relativistic particles, cold dust and the cosmological vacuum. The average cosmic pressure is accordingly

[formula]

For convenience, let us define the equation-of-state parameter w = w(t) such that

[formula]

In addition to the vacuum-density

[formula]

associated with the cosmological constant, the vacuum-density ρφ associated with an inflationary scalar field φ may contribute to ν.

Given that Λ  >  0, there exists at all times a CEH with a finite proper radius

[formula]

where H(a) = H represents the parameterization of H in terms of the scale factor, or the corresponding variable of integration, α. Although the right side of Eq.([\ref=EqRe]) is parameterized in terms of a, it is convenient for the present purposes to regard Re as being implicitly a function of t. It follows from Eq.([\ref=EqRe]) that

[formula]

The total energy enclosed within the horizon is Ee  =  ρVe, where Ve = 4πR3e / 3. We assume throughout the following that the entropy Se of the CEH is given by

[formula]

throughout all cosmological ages considered here. The attribution of the entropy in Eq.([\ref=EqSE]) to a dynamical CEH is well motivated and produces physically consistent results [\cite=Dav1987] [\cite=Dav1988a], [\cite=Dav1988b], [\cite=PS1989], [\cite=Pav1990], [\cite=Bru2000], [\cite=IP2006].

Analogously to the procedure used to identify the temperature of the CAH, let us determine the temperature Te of the CEH in a FRW universe by introducing an infinitesimal uniform perturbation δ ρ at some time tp such that the average cosmic background density becomes ρ(tp)  +  δ ρ. Note that ρ is the original background density in the absence of the perturbation. Let the magnitude of the perturbation increase rapidly from 0 at time tv   -   δ t to its characteristic magnitude |δ ρ| at time tv, where δ t is small enough to ensure that the CEH is quasi-stationary and ρ is otherwise nearly constant during the interval

[formula]

. The perturbation thus changes the horizon entropy at time t = tv by δ Se≃2πRe(tv)δ Re. It follows from Eq.([\ref=EqFLTsch]) that Te is given by

[formula]

Because tv is arbitrary it has not been shown explicitly in Eq.([\ref=EqTe0]), which is meant to be general.

In contrast to Ra, which is defined completely in terms of contemporaneous parameters, Re is determined by the manner in which the Hubble parameter evolves throughout all future times. In order to determine δ Re it is therefore necessary to address the behavior of the perturbation throughout all future times. We may introduce time-dependence to the perturbation most conveniently by defining f = f (t) such that the total background density at any time t  ≥  tv is given by ρ  +  fδ ρ. We therefore have f (tv) = 1. For all later times, f is determined completely by a basic condition necessary for physical consistency. In order for the perturbation to be a physically meaningful probe it must be designed such that the universe evolves in the natural manner for all times after tv. We require that the additional contribution fδ ρ to the background density must evolve naturally, in the same manner as ρ, and hence

[formula]

Let us now incorporate the time-dependent perturbation into Eq.([\ref=EqRe]), thereby obtaining an expression for δ Re. With ρ replaced by ρ + fδ ρ the Hubble parameter for all t  ≥  tv becomes

[formula]

We accordingly define

[formula]

At time tv the proper radius of the CEH may be expressed as

[formula]

A first-order expansion of the integrand in Eq.([\ref=EqRedd]) produces

[formula]

where δ H has been expressed explicitly. The stipulation that curvature is negligible implies H2  ≈  8πρ / 3, hence

[formula]

Recall from Eq.([\ref=Eqconst]) that fδ ρ  /  ρ is constant, and may be therefore extracted from the integral. The expression for δ Re in Eq.([\ref=EqdRe1c]) is thus reduced to its final form

[formula]

where explicit reference to tv has been omitted for generality.

We may now determine Te. It follows from Eqs.([\ref=EqTe0]) and ([\ref=EqdRe]) that the temperature of the CEH in a flat FRW universe is given by

[formula]

in direct analogy to the temperature of the CAH. Note that the right side of Eq.([\ref=EqTe]) is asymptotically identical to the static dS temperature, 1 / (2πRe).

Dynamical First Law for the CEH

Presumably, the FLT for stationary cosmological horizons represents the special case d V  =  0 of a more general, fully dynamical form of the FLT. Given that Eq.([\ref=EqFLTsch]) is identical to the conventional FLT, but with the sign of δ E reversed, it is reasonable to expect that the putative dynamical FLT for cosmological horizons has the form

[formula]

for some appropriately defined X that is analogous to the quantity of pressure appearing in the conventional FLT.

The purpose of this Section is to demonstrate that Eq.([\ref=EqFLTC]), with X = P, produces a successful representation of a dynamical form of the FLT for the CEH in a flat FRW universe, which may be stated as

[formula]

With the associated terms expressed explicitly, the left and right sides of Eq.([\ref=EqFLTE]) may be written respectively as

[formula]

and

[formula]

where Ae is the surface area of the CEH. In the remainder of this Section, the validity of Eq.([\ref=EqFLTE]) is tested in the primary eras associated with the standard FRW cosmology.

During an era of radiation-dominance (RD) we have ρ≃ε, P≃ρ / 3 and [formula]. If k / a2 is very small in comparison to ρ then the difference between the right and left sides of Eq.([\ref=EqFLTE]) is vanishing during RD.

Next, consider some late time during vacuum-dominance (VD), when μ is small with respect to ρΛ and ε is negligible in comparison to μ. The contribution from k / a2 is assumed also to be negligible in the de Sitter era. The corresponding cosmic pressure is P≃  -  ρΛ, and the Hubble parameter is

[formula]

where

[formula]

With μ(α)  =  μ(a)a3  /  α3, Eq. ([\ref=EqRe]) produces

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Consequently, we have

[formula]

It follows from Eqs.([\ref=EqHVD]) through ([\ref=EqdotREVD]) that the right and left sides of Eq.([\ref=EqFLTE]) both reduce to πμR2e during VD in late times.

Discussion

Relying only on first principles, the analysis in Section [\ref=Temp] produced an expression for the temperature Te of the CEH in a flat FRW universe. Section [\ref=FLTE] introduced a dynamical form of the FLT for the CEH, with the sign of d E reversed analogously to the FLT for stationary cosmological horizons [\cite=Cai2002a], [\cite=Cai2002b]. With Te given by Eq.([\ref=EqTe]), the FLT in Eq.([\ref=FLTE]) is valid during RD and during the late de Sitter era of VD in a flat FRW universe.

In contrast to the usual assumption that Te is always given by (2πRe)- 1, and therefore generally much smaller than unity, the present thesis specifies a temperature that may be larger than unity by many orders. For instance, consider the standard Λ-CDM cosmology with an early era of vacuum-driven inflation lasting for roughly 60 e-folds. Although Te is not generally valid in curved FRW spacetimes, it is valid at the end of inflation when curvature is negligible. Using the nominal parameters Λ≃10- 122, Tφ≃10- 4 and TP≃10- 1, where TP is the photon temperature at the Planck time, it follows from Eq. ([\ref=EqRe]) that Re may be as large as (Λ  /  ρφ)1 / 4≃1033 at the end of inflation [\cite=BF2003]. The corresponding enclosed energy would be order near 1086, and it follows from Eq.([\ref=EqTe]) that Te≃1020 at the end of inflation. Alternatively, in the absence of inflation, we have Re≃1029 and Te≃1029 near the Planck era. The occurrence of such enormous primordial horizon temperatures deserves further consideration. It is sufficient here to mention that the preponderance of the enclosed fluid is not generally in thermal equilibrium with the horizon temperature.

If the present model is meaningful then the thermodynamic evolution it specifies for the CEH should be presumably consistent with the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics (GSLT). Such a determination is beyond the scope of this present work. It is nonetheless appropriate to survey the current understanding of the evolution of the CEH with respect to the GSLT in order to anticipate broadly how Eqs.([\ref=EqTe]) and ([\ref=EqFLTE]) may be relevant.

Throughout the evolution of a FRW universe, background particles comprising the cosmic fluid are continuously transported across the CEH, from the interior to the exterior, as a natural consequence of cosmic expansion. The continuous migration increases Se, but decreases the entropy Ie of the enclosed fluid. In order for the CEH to evolve in a manner that preserves the GSLT, the change in the total entropy [formula] during some infinitesimal interval δ t must be generally non-negative. If Ie  =  Veσ, where σ is the average entropy density of the cosmic fluid, then [formula] in a broad range of plausible spacetime scenarios, and to that extent the evolution of the CEH conforms to the GSLT [\cite=Dav1987], [\cite=DDL2003]. A more detailed requirement follows from evaluating [formula] in terms of the Gibbs equation. Specifically, as particles comprising the cosmic fluid approach the CEH, they presumably interact with the Hawking radiation emanating therefrom. If the fluid is locally in thermal equilibrium with the horizon then the Gibbs equation specifies that [\cite=IP2006]

[formula]

If [formula] is given by Eq.([\ref=EqGE]), and if Te = 1 / (2πRe), then the thermodynamic behavior of the CEH in a vacuum-dominated universe may violate the GSLT [\cite=WGA2007], [\cite=WGA2006].

According to the present thesis, however, the temperature of the CEH is not generally equal to Te = 1 / (2πRe), and the conclusions in Refs.[\cite=WGA2007] and [\cite=WGA2006] may be substantially different with Te given by Eq.([\ref=EqTe]). Moreover, even if the cosmic fluid is locally in thermodynamic equilibrium with the CEH, the implementation of the Gibbs equation is sensitive to the nature of dark energy. In fact, in the scenario of holographic dark energy described in Ref. [\cite=Li2004], the asymptotic CEH actually conforms to the GSLT, with [formula] given by the appropriate Gibbs equation and Te  =  1 / (2πRe) [\cite=BGLeD2007]. The degree to which the CEH conforms to the GSLT in the various models of dark energy, with Te given by Eq.([\ref=EqTe]), is reserved for future study.
