Introduction

Distinctive for the reduced Beltrami equation

[formula]

for almost every z∈Ω, is that its solutions create an [formula]-linear family of quasiregular mappings. The reduced equation arises naturally in a great variety of topics; for instance, in the study of linear families of quasiregular mappings, and also in the Stoïlow factorization and the G-closure problems for the general Beltrami equation

[formula]

for almost every z∈Ω.

It is clear from the definition that a differential constraint in [\eqref=rdc] is stronger than the one in the classical Beltrami equation. Hence f is K-quasiregular with [formula]. In this paper we assume an appropriate regularity, i.e., [formula] for a domain [formula].

Studies of the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc] indicate that for its solutions, reduced quasiregular mappings, the null Lagrangian

[formula]

has many properties similar to the Jacobian determinant of a Sobolev function. We prove the following key result in this direction, answering in positive Conjecture 6.3.1 in [\cite=AIM].

Suppose [formula], [formula], is a solution to the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc]. Then either ∂zf is a constant or else

[formula]

Thus if  [formula] vanishes on a set of positive measure, then f(z)  =  az  +  b, where [formula] and [formula].

In Geometric Function Theory the above fact has a similar important role as that of the Jacobian determinant of a general quasiregular map, [formula]. The null Lagrangian [formula] appears naturally as the denominator in algebraic fractions; for example, in the G-compactness studies of K-quasiregular families.

For special properties of the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc], we refer the reader to the recent monograph [\cite=AIM]. An early application of the reduced equation can be found in [\cite=Boj]. The reduced equation has generated a considerable new-found interest, see [\cite=AN], [\cite=AIM], [\cite=AJ], [\cite=G-cpt], [\cite=IKO1] [\cite=IKO], [\cite=KO1], and [\cite=KO2].

First steps in giving the positive answer to the conjecture were made by F. Giannetti, T. Iwaniec, L. Kovalev, G. Moscariello, and C. Sbordone in [\cite=G-cpt]. They proved the statement for global homeomorphisms, that is, homeomorphisms of the plane [formula], when [formula] in [\eqref=rdc]. Next, G. Alessandrini and V. Nesi showed in [\cite=AN] the assertion for global homeomorphisms. A direct, and substantially simplified, proof of this result can be found in [\cite=AJ] or Theorem 6.4.1 in [\cite=AIM].

The case of plane homeomorphisms was used, for example, to study linear families of quasiconformal mappings. Moreover, by combining it with the ideas and results developed in [\cite=G-cl] and [\cite=G-cpt], one can show that the family of Beltrami differential operators is G-compact, see Section 16.6 in [\cite=AIM].

In spite of the close analogy with the global homeomorphic case, our proof requires more involved methods and rigorous analysis. Difference is that we consider an arbitrary domain [formula] instead of the whole plane [formula] in the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc]; the earlier proofs use the property that a solution is a global homeomorphism [formula]. The key element of our proof is the weak reverse H�lder inequality for the solutions to so-called adjoint equations. We use it with a smoothness at a point to derive our result.

The reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc] is closely related to linear families of quasiregular mappings. The key ingredient is the following Wronsky-type theorem. It shows that the singular set of a two-dimensional linear family of quasiregular mappings has measure zero. This was conjectured for homeomorhisms in [\cite=G-cl] and proven for them in [\cite=AN], [\cite=AJ]. We establish a more general theorem.

Suppose [formula] are solutions to [\eqref=gen]. Solutions Ψ and Φ are [formula]-linearly independent if and only if complex gradients ∂zΦ and ∂zΨ are pointwise independent almost everywhere, i.e.,

[formula]

Above J(Φ,Ψ) plays the role of Wronskian. Note that, if Ψ and Φ are [formula]-linearly dependent, then [formula].

Given an [formula]-linear subspace [formula], we say that F is a linear family of quasiregular mappings, if there is 1  ≤  K <   ∞   such that for every f∈F the function f is K-quasiregular in Ω. The family F is generated by the maps fi, i  =  I, if

[formula]

for some [formula]-linearly independent quasiregular mappings [formula]. We always assume that the linear family is generated by countable set of functions. It quickly follows that in case of linear families that consist of quasiconformal mappings,  dim  F  ≤  2, see [\cite=G-cl]. Recall that a linear family of quasiregular mappings is not always two-dimensional, e.g., 1-quasiregular family spanned by fi(z)  =  zi, i  =  1,2,3.

In general, quasiregularity is not preserved under linear combinations, simple example is [formula], [formula]. However, if we have mappings that happen to be solutions to the same general Beltrami equation [\eqref=gen], then their linear combinations are quasiregular. Conversely, [\cite=G-cl] associates to a linear two-dimensional family F of quasiregular mappings a general Beltrami equation of the type [\eqref=gen] satisfied by every g∈F, see also Remark 16.6.7 in [\cite=AIM]. We show that the associated equation is unique.

For any linear family F of quasiregular mappings, there exists a corresponding general linear Beltrami equation

[formula]

almost everywhere in Ω, satisfied by every element f∈F.

Moreover, the associated equation is unique.

Adjoint equation

We begin with the adjoint equation approach, similarly as in [\cite=AN] and [\cite=AJ]. We study the solution [formula] to the reduced Beltrami equation

[formula]

for almost every z∈Ω. Let us write f(z)  =  u(z)  +  iv(z), where u and v are real-valued; similarly notate λ(z)  =  α(z)  +  iβ(z).

Using the definition of complex partial derivatives (i.e., 2∂z  =  ∂x  -  i∂y and [formula]) and taking the imaginary part of the reduced equation gives uy  +  vx  =  β(vx - uy), that is,

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Since |β(z)|  ≤  |λ(z)|  ≤  k  <  1, the coefficients 2 / (β(z)  ±  1) in [\eqref=uy] are uniformly bounded from below. Hence [formula] and uy have the same zeros.

For the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc2], the derivative uy is a weak solution to the adjoint equation determined by a non-divergence type operator. More precisely, consider an operator

[formula]

where σij  =  σji are measurable and the matrix

[formula]

is uniformly elliptic,

[formula]

for all [formula] and z∈Ω. Above K is the ellipticity constant. The mapping [formula] is a weak solution to the adjoint equation L*(ω)  =  0 if

[formula]

To identify uy as a weak solution to an adjoint equation of the type [\eqref=adjoint], we recall that the components of solutions f = u  +  iv to general Beltrami systems [\eqref=gen] satisfy a divergence type second-order equation, see Section 16.1.5 in [\cite=AIM]; note that one gets the divergence type equations for solutions to general Beltrami systems defined in any domain Ω, but getting from the divergence type equations to [\eqref=gen] one needs the domain to be simply connected.

In the case of the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc2], the component u satisfies

[formula]

where the matrix elements are

[formula]

Specifically [\eqref=div] means that for every φ∈C∞0(Ω)

[formula]

But since derivatives of smooth test functions are again test functions, we can replace φ by φy∈C∞0(Ω) in [\eqref=id]. Now, a straightforward calculation shows that uy is a weak solution to the adjoint equation L*(uy)  =  0, where

[formula]

and a12,a22 are given by [\eqref=a1222]. We note that the original matrix A(z) is not symmetric. However, the operator L in [\eqref=L] can be represented by the symmetric matrix

[formula]

and, as |λ(z)|  ≤  k  <  1, from [\eqref=a1222] we see that σ is uniformly elliptic.

Weak reverse H�lder inequality

Let [formula] be a real-valued weak solution to the adjoint equation L*(ω)  =  0 of the type [\eqref=adjoint]. Then a weak reverse H�lder inequality holds for ω; namely,

[formula]

for every disk [formula] such that [formula]. The constant c depends only on the ellipticity constant K.

There is a stronger result for non-negative solutions: a reverse H�lder inequality holds, see [\cite=FS] or Theorem 6.4.2 in [\cite=AIM].

We start with a well-known interpolation inequality, for instance, [\cite=BL], [\cite=Mazja], and [\cite=Triebel].

Let g∈W2,p(U) be real-valued, where [formula] is a bounded smooth domain and p  >  1. Then

[formula]

where c depends only on U.

By a basic interpolation between Sobolev spaces, see § 4.3.1, Theorem 1 with § 2.4.2, (11) in [\cite=Triebel],

[formula]

and thus

[formula]

Then we use the inequality

[formula]

to derive

[formula]

Choosing ε sufficiently small the term with [formula] is absorbed to the left-hand side, and we arrive at the estimate [\eqref=inter].

Next, let us recall some of the key estimates in this connection. There is always a unique solution to the following Dirichlet problem in a bounded domain D with a thick boundary, see Chapter 17 in [\cite=AIM],

[formula]

where the operator L is of the type [\eqref=Leq]. By the Alexandrov-Bakel'man-Pucci maximum principle, see Theorem 17.3.1 in [\cite=AIM] or Theorem 9.1 in [\cite=GT],

[formula]

and c depends only on the ellipticity constant K.

Let g be a real-valued solution to the Dirichlet problem [\eqref=dirichlet]. If L(g) = 0 in a subdomain V  ⊂  D, then for every relatively compact smooth subdomain V'  ⊂  V where c depends on [formula], V, and V'.

We use the interior regularity from [\cite=Pucci]; alternatively, see Chapter 17 in [\cite=AIM]. By Lemma 4.1 in [\cite=Pucci], the complex gradient gz is quasiregular in V. Further, by Corollary 5.1 in [\cite=Pucci],

[formula]

Moreover, the corollary implies for every relatively compact subdomain V'  ⊂  V the uniform estimate

[formula]

where c depends on p, V, and V'. Actually, for the potential function, [formula] for all [formula]. Thus by the Sobolev embedding, or more strictly by Morrey's inequality, we achieve the following estimate for the H�lder norm

[formula]

where γ  =  1  -  2 / p. Now we use the interpolation inequality [\eqref=inter] to write

[formula]

Hence, by combining the previous estimates with [\eqref=interior], we have shown

[formula]

In the following proof, we will also use the consequence of the Leibniz rule,

[formula]

where L is an operator defined as in [\eqref=Leq].

Without loss of generality we can assume a  =  0. We show the claim for the unit disk [formula] and then use a rescaling argument.

For the unit disk case, it is enough to prove

[formula]

We solve the Dirichlet problem [\eqref=dirichlet] for [formula] and [formula]. As in [\eqref=dirichlet] we notate the W2,2-solution by g.

Let 1  <  δ  <  4 / 3 and [formula] satisfy [formula] on [formula] with [formula] for |α|  ≤  2. Now [formula]. Since ω is an adjoint solution in [formula], L*(ω)  =  0, by approximating with smooth functions we find that

[formula]

The consequence of the Leibniz rule [\eqref=leibniz] gives

[formula]

Further, by using Lemma [\ref=gradbound] to the sets

[formula]

we have The inequality [\eqref=enough] follows by the consequence of the Alexandrov-Bakel'man-Pucci maximum principle [\eqref=abp].

We are left with the rescaling. Assume 2B  ⊂  Ω. We set

[formula]

By definition, Lr is a uniformly elliptic non-divergence type operator with the same ellipticity constant K as the operator L. Further, ωr is an adjoint solution in Ωr: = {z∈Ω:rz∈Ω} for Lr and [formula]. Thus the above proof shows

[formula]

Next we use the change of variables to get Combining the above calculation with [\eqref=dr] gives

[formula]

It is well-known, see Gehring's lemma, for example, from Section 4.3 in [\cite=BI] or Chapter 14 in [\cite=gft], that a weak reverse H�lder inequality improves integrability: if a weak reverse H�lder inequality [\eqref=wrH] holds for ω, then there is p  >  2 such that

[formula]

Zeros of infinite order

A weak reverse H�lder inequality implies that almost every zero is of infinite order; that is,

Let ω satisfy a weak reverse H�lder inequality [\eqref=wrH]. Then, for almost every zero z0 of  ω and for every positive integer N, there is  r0(z0,N)  >  0 such that

[formula]

We use the iteration argument from pp. 299-300 in [\cite=BI] and Theorem 14.5.1 in [\cite=gft].

Set E  =  {z∈Ω:ω(z)  =  0}. Assume |E|  >  0. Let z0 be a point of density of E. We fix a positive integer N. Since z0 is a density point, we find that, for r0: = r0(z0,N) sufficiently small,

[formula]

holds for all 0  <  δ  ≤  1, where c is the constant from the weak reverse H�lder inequality. Thus

[formula]

Iterating yields for [formula]

[formula]

For each 0  <  r  ≤  r0 there exists k such that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=imnon]

We are ready to answer in positive Conjecture 6.3.1 in [\cite=AIM].

Let f  =  u  +  iv be a solution to the reduced Beltrami equation

[formula]

for almost every z∈Ω. By [\eqref=uy]

[formula]

Assume |E|  >  0. We have shown above that uy is a solution to the adjoint equation and thus a weak reverse H�lder inequality holds for uy. Further, by Theorem [\ref=zeros],

[formula]

for almost every z0∈E and for all positive integers N, when r  >  0 is small enough. In the second inequality we use [\eqref=uy] again.

A.   Series representation

We will prove that for almost every z0∈E and for all positive integers n,

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] are constants depending only on f and z0 and

[formula]

holds for small enough r  >  0. We deduce the statement of our theorem from this by quasiregularity.

Fix a positive integer n. Choose z0∈E and r0∈(0,1] such that [formula] and [\eqref=zbarinf] holds for N  =  n  +  2 and 0  <  r  ≤  r0. By the weak reverse H�lder inequality [\eqref=wrH] and the improved integrability, see Remark [\ref=impro], [\eqref=zbarinf] implies for some p0  >  2

[formula]

when 0  <  r  ≤  r0. Alternatively one could use Astala's higher integrability, see [\cite=ast] or Theorem 13.2.3 in [\cite=AIM].

Suppose [formula]. We begin by showing that

[formula]

where 0  <  r  ≤  r0 and [formula] are constants depending only on f and z0.

Smoothness at a point has been studied, for example, in [\cite=dynkin] and we use a few similar ideas.

Step 1.   Generalized Cauchy formula

First, the generalized Cauchy formula gives Since the first term is analytic in the disk [formula], using the Taylor expansion about z0 it can be written in the form

[formula]

For the second term,

[formula]

as soon as we show the convergence of the coefficient integrals

[formula]

Observe that after we have the convergence of integrals, f(w) is a sum of a holomorphic part and T.

Step 2.   Convergence of the integrals

Dividing in annuli

[formula]

for [formula],

[formula]

by [\eqref=zbarinf]. Indeed, our choice N  =  n  +  2 gives for [formula],

[formula]

Thus the coefficient integrals [\eqref=coef] converge. For a future reference, the same reasoning shows

[formula]

by [\eqref=int2].

Step 3.   Remainder term

Set cj  =  aj  -  bj for [formula]. Thus, as the remainder term in [\eqref=inforder1], we have E  =  Rn  +  T, where Rn is holomorphic with Rn(w)  =  O(|z  -  w|n) and

[formula]

To prove [\eqref=inforder1], we are left to show the estimate for the derivative DE.

Recall [formula]. By definition, the derivative of the holomorphic part DRn has the correct convergence rate. After combining [formula] with [\eqref=zbarinf], we see that only the estimation of ∂zT remains.

The integral term in T is the Cauchy transform C of

[formula]

The above is well-defined, since [formula] by [\eqref=fut]. Now, for almost every w,

[formula]

where the Beurling transform S is given by the principal value integral

[formula]

We start with the first term in [\eqref=appT]. By inequality [\eqref=fut], there is a H�lder conjugate pair 1  <  q  <  2  <  p  <    ∞   such that [formula], since F has a compact support. Thus C(F)∈C0(), and moreover,

[formula]

see, for example, Theorem 4.3.11 in [\cite=AIM]. We have

[formula]

For the second term in [\eqref=appT] the H�lder inequality implies

[formula]

We have proven the estimate [\eqref=inforder1].

Step 4.   No higher-order terms

Observe for [formula]

[formula]

where we notate cj  =  αj  +  iβj. Further, straight from [\eqref=inforder1]

[formula]

Now, the estimates for the convergence rate in [\eqref=zbarinf] and [\eqref=inforder1] imply [formula] and cj  =  0, [formula].

We have shown the series representation [\eqref=inforder] with the estimate [\eqref=Derror].

B.   Conclusion by quasiregularity

We use similar methods as in pp. 299-300 [\cite=BI] and Section 16.10 in [\cite=gft]. In the references these ideas are used to prove that the Jacobian of a nonconstant quasiregular mapping is nonvanishing almost everywhere.

The constant c1 in [\eqref=inforder] is real and hence g(w): = f(w)  -  c0  -  c1(w  -  z0) solves the same reduced Beltrami equation as f. Therefore, g is quasiregular with the following property for every positive integer n

[formula]

Since the weak reduced H�lder inequality holds for |Dg| by quasiregularity, we achieve for every positive integer N

[formula]

Quasiregularity and a version of Morrey's inequality implies the H�lder continuity of the form

[formula]

and 0  <  α(K)  <  1, see, for instance, Theorem 5.2 in [\cite=BI]. Thus

[formula]

This proves our statement: g is quasiregular and hence the classical Stoïlow factorization holds; that is, [formula], where h is holomorphic and G a quasiconformal homeomorphism. If g is nonconstant, the quasisymmetry of G and h(z)  =  O(|z  -  G(z0)|m), m  ≥  1, imply that there exists γ  >  0 such that

[formula]

This would be a contradiction with [\eqref=prop]. Thus g is a constant; and f(z)  =  c0  +  c1(z0  -  w), where [formula], [formula], proving our claim.

Linear families of quasiregular mappings. Proofs of Theorems [\ref=family] and [\ref=independent]

Suppose [formula] are solutions to the general Beltrami equation [\eqref=gen]. Moreover, assume Φ, Ψ are not affine combinations of each other. We show that ∂zΦ and ∂zΨ are linearly independent over the field [formula], that is,

[formula]

We can assume Φ is nonconstant. As a nonconstant quasiregular mapping, it follows that Φ is discrete, open, and the branch set consists of isolated points. Thus it is enough to study points outside the branch set. Let z0 be such a point. There exists a ball [formula] such that Φ|B:B  →  Φ(B) is a homeomorphism, hence quasiconformal. From the Stoïlow factorization of general Beltrami equations, Theorem 6.1.1 in [\cite=AIM], we know that

[formula]

where F solves the reduced Beltrami equation [\eqref=rdc] in Φ(B) with

[formula]

Let z∈B. Using the chain rule and identities

[formula]

where h  =  f- 1 and w  =  f(z), we arrive at

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

Since Φ|B preserves sets of zero measure, the statement follows by Theorem [\ref=imnon].

Step 1. Two-dimensional family.  It is known that for any linear two-dimensional family F of quasiregular mappings [formula] there exists a corresponding general Beltrami equation

[formula]

almost everywhere in Ω, satisfied by every element f∈F, see the beginning of Section 5.3 in [\cite=G-cl] or the proof of Theorem 16.6.6 in [\cite=AIM]. We recall the ideas of the proof for the reader's convenience, and further, show that the associated equation is unique.

Assume [formula] generate a linear family F of K-quasiregular mappings. The goal is to find coefficients μ and ν such that

[formula]

almost everywhere in Ω. In the regular set RF of F, i.e., the set of points z∈Ω where the matrix

[formula]

is invertible, the values μ(z) and ν(z) are uniquely determined by [\eqref=coeff], that is,

[formula]

Note that changing the generators corresponds to multiplying M(z) by an invertible constant matrix. Hence the regular set and its complement, the singular set

[formula]

depend only on the family F and not the choice of generators.

It can be proven that for almost every z∈SF the vector [formula] lies in the range of the linear operator [formula]. It follows that on the singular set one may define ν(z)  =  0. Here the assumption that the family F consists entirely of quasiregular mappings is needed. By quasiregularity, one has for every [formula]

[formula]

There is a technical difficulty: the set where the inequality [\eqref=qrfamily] holds depends, in general, on α and β. A short argument shows that [\eqref=qrfamily] holds on the same set of full measure for all reals, see Lemma 12.1 in [\cite=G-cpt] or p. 465 in [\cite=AIM].

Finally, ellipticity bounds in [\eqref=geneq] follow for the singular set SF by definition of μ and ν, since Φ and Ψ are K-quasiregular. For the regular set one tests the inequality [\eqref=qrfamily] by real-valued measurable functions θ(z) instead of parameters α and β.

As seen above, the existence of the general Beltrami equation [\eqref=geneq] follows from local properties. For the uniqueness we need also global qualities. Here Theorem [\ref=independent] comes into play. The coefficients are uniquely determined on the regular set RF by [\eqref=coeff2] and [\eqref=coeff3]. Moreover, Theorem [\ref=independent] shows that the singular set SF has measure zero, thus proving the uniqueness.

Step 2. General linear family.  It is a straightforward calculation after the two-dimensional case to achieve the same for general linear families.

Since the family consists of K-quasiregular mappings, we have the inequality

[formula]

There is the same technical difficulty as above; namely the set where the inequality [\eqref=qrfamily2] holds depends, in general, on real numbers ai. Noting that there are only countable many generators by assumption, the same argument as before works, see Lemma 12.1 in [\cite=G-cpt] or p. 465 in [\cite=AIM]. Hence we have a set E  ⊂  Ω of full measure such that [\eqref=qrfamily2] holds for all real coefficients ai.

Note that two generating mappings, for example, f1 and f2, define a two-dimensional linear family of quasiregular mappings, and thus functions of the two-dimensional family satisfy the unique general linear Beltrami equation [\eqref=gen]. Further, by Theorem [\ref=independent], we have a set of full measure E'  ⊂  E such that ∂zf1(z) and ∂zf2(z) are [formula]-linearly independent on E'.

Our goal is to find [formula] that satisfies

For [formula],

[formula]

[formula].

Moreover, we want every mapping f∈F to solve the Beltrami equation

[formula]

We define H for z∈E' by [\eqref=Hqr3] going through all mappings f∈F. The function H is not over-determined. Indeed, on E' the inequality [\eqref=qrfamily] holds, and hence if ∂zf(z)  =  ∂zg(z) for some f,g∈F, then [formula]. Moreover, since ∂zf1(z) and ∂zf2(z) are [formula]-linearly independent on E', by our above remark, H(z,w) is defined for all [formula].

The definition of H and quasiregularity of mappings imply k-Lipschitz property on the second variable, that is, condition (H1). Also (H2) and that the equation [\eqref=Hqr3] holds for all f∈F follow straight from definition.

Finally, we see that the linearity of the family F is inherited by H, that is, w  ↦  H(z,w) is [formula]-linear. Thus we have [formula], where |μ(z)|  +  |ν(z)|  ≤  k  <  1. Since μ and ν are uniquely defined and measurable for two-dimensional linear families, our claim follows.
