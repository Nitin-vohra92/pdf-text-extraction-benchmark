Conductance and Eigenvalue

A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables {Xi}i  ≥  1 taking values in a finite set such that

[formula]

Let the state space of the Markov chain be

[formula]

is defined to be

[formula]

The following theorem plays a central role in the theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains.

Let λ  <  1 be an eigenvalue of the transition matrix of an ergodic time-reversible Markov chain with conductance φ. Then, [formula].

In this note we strengthen this inequality slightly.

Let λ∈(0,1) be an eigenvalue of the transition matrix of an ergodic time-reversible Markov chain with conductance φ. Then,

[formula]

Such an inequality was derived by Radhakrishnan and Sudan [\cite=RS06] for the special case of random walks on regular undirected graphs. The purpose of this note is to show that their arguments (which were a slight variation on the arguments in [\cite=JS89] [\cite=HLW]) apply to finite-state ergodic time-reversible Markov chains as well.

Let π be the stationary distribution of the chain with transition matrix P. Let [formula]. We will be thinking of f,g,π as vectors in [formula]. Let

[formula]

and [formula]. f is said to be proper if

[formula]

We have the following two claims.

For any proper f,

[formula]

For λ∈(0,1), there exists a proper f such that

[formula]

Using ([\ref=eq:conductance]) and ([\ref=eq:laplacian]), we obtain

[formula]

from which the theorem follows. Proof of Claim [\ref=claim-conductance]. Permute the co-ordinates of f such that [formula]. (Note that [formula].) We show that

[formula]

To see the first inequality, we observe that

[formula]

Secondly

[formula]

The calculations up to this point are identical to those in [\cite=JS89] [\cite=HLW]; the calculations below are similar to those in [\cite=RS06].

[formula]

Proof of Claim [\ref=claim-laplacian]. Let [formula] be a right eigenvector of PT with eigenvalue λ∈(0,1) . We may assume [formula] (otherwise consider - g). By renaming the co-ordinates we may assume that [formula]. Let f be such that fi  =  gi for i∈[r] and 0 otherwise. Then

[formula]

Then, [formula].
