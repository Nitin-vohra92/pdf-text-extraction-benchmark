Observation of heavy-hole hyperfine interaction in quantum dots

Theoretical and experimental studies during the last decade have established that hyperfine interaction with the quantum dot (QD) nuclei constitute the principal decoherence mechanism for electron spin qubits [\cite=Coish:2004] [\cite=Petta:2005] [\cite=Koppens:2006] [\cite=Mikkelsen:2007]. An interesting strategy to circumvent the leakage of quantum information to the nuclear spin environment is to represent quantum information with the pseudo-spin of a QD heavy-hole (HH): since HH states are formed predominantly out of bonding p-orbitals of the lattice atoms, it had been argued that the HH hyperfine interaction should be negligible. Recently, it was shown theoretically that the hyperfine interaction of a HH with the nuclear spins, while being Ising-like, could in fact be comparable in strength to that of the electron in strain-free GaAs QDs [\cite=Fischer:2008]. However, the majority of the experiments studying HH spins have been carried out in highly strained InGaAs QDs[\cite=Brunner:2009] [\cite=Gerardot:2008] [\cite=Heiss:2008]; the strength and nature of hyperfine interaction in these optically active QDs have, to a large extent, remained unexplored [\cite=Kurtze:2009].

In this Letter, we present resonance fluorescence (RF) measurements that directly reveal the relative strength of the HH-hyperfine interaction in single-electron charged InGaAs QDs. To this end, we generate a precise amount of nuclear spin polarization by dragging the blue trion resonance using a non-perturbative laser field [\cite=Latta:2009]. We then measure the resulting Overhauser shift of the QD transitions that are shifted either by the Zeeman energy of the exciton (i.e. the red trion transition) or the electron (the forbidden/diagonal transition) with respect to the blue trion resonance. The nuclear spin polarization induced energy shifts in these transitions are determined by the difference and the sum of the Overhauser field seen by the electron and the HH, respectively. Measuring the nuclear spin polarization induced shift of these two transitions allows us to directly determine the ratio of the HH to electron Overhauser shift to be [formula] in two QDs and [formula] in a third QD.

Our sample consists of charge-tunable InGaAs self assembled QDs embedded in a Schottky-diode structure. All experiments are carried out at 4.2 K with an external field in the Faraday geometry; the applied gate voltage range is chosen to ensure that the QD is single-electron charged. Figure 1 inset shows the relevant energy levels in this regime where the QD optical transitions couple the spin up [formula] (spin down [formula]) ground state to an optically excited blue (red) trion state [formula] ([formula]). The two ground and excited states are split by the Zeeman energies |ge|μBB and |gh|μBB. Due to heavy-light-hole mixing, the spin up [formula] (spin down [formula]) state also couples to the other trion state [formula] ([formula]), albeit with an oscillator strength that is ~  10- 3 times smaller; we refer to these as the diagonal transitions.

Our experiments combine two recent advances in experimental QD spin physics; namely the high-efficiency detection of resonance fluorescence (RF)[\cite=Yilmaz:2010] [\cite=Vamivakas:2009] [\cite=Flagg:2009] and the possibility to lock a QD resonance to an incident laser frequency via nuclear spin polarization [\cite=Latta:2009]. Figure [\ref=Fig1](a) shows the gate-voltage dependent RF signal from the blue trion transition at B = 4T when the pump laser is scanned from an initial blue-detuning (ωp  >  ω0t - b) to a final red detuning (ωp  <  ω0t - b); here ω0t - b is the trion resonance frequency in the absence of nuclear spin polarization and ωp is the pump laser frequency. Reflected photons from the linearly polarized excitation laser are blocked using a polarization suppression scheme [\cite=Yilmaz:2010]. The RF signal is strong at the edges of the plateau where co-tunneling rate [formula] is large, and disappears in the middle of the plateau due to spin pumping [\cite=Atature:2006] [\cite=Dreiser:2008]. The characteristic extension of the peaks in the direction of the laser scan is due to dynamic nuclear spin polarization, i.e. the resonance dragging effect [\cite=Latta:2009]. Experiments are performed at the gate voltage indicated by the dashed line where the dragging range is close to maximum. At this gate voltage the RF contrast is reduced [formula] times due to spin pumping. Figure[\ref=Fig1](b) shows laser scans obtained at a gate voltage denoted by the dashed line in Fig. [\ref=Fig1](a) for two opposite scan directions: a total dragging range of [formula]GHz is observed. We define the middle point between the onset of forward and backward dragging to represent ωp  -  ω0t - b  =  Δ  =  0. All other frequencies are measured relative to this point. In the remainder of the measurements we use the detuning Δ of the pump laser that is slowly scanned across the blue trion transition, in either forward or backward direction, as a knob for adjusting the amount of nuclear spin polarization in the QD.

Since the electrons in the relevant optically excited states form a singlet, the nuclear-spin-polarization-induced change in the trion Zeeman splitting is given exclusively by the Overhauser shift of a single HH. To measure this HH Overhauser shift, we tune a strong pump laser to create a precise amount of nuclear spin polarization by dragging the blue trion transition from ω0t - b to ω0t - b  +  Δ. The pump laser which remains on resonance throughout the dragging range, at the same time leads to a substantial electron spin pumping into the [formula] state, causing a reduction in the strength of the RF signal. Subsequently, we scan a weak probe laser across the red trion and the diagonal resonances: once the probe laser is on resonance with either the red trion (Fig. [\ref=Fig2](a)) or diagonal (Fig [\ref=Fig2](b)) [\cite=Kroner:2008] transition, it pumps the electron spin back to the [formula] state, leading to a partial recovery of the RF signal. The top traces in Fig. [\ref=Fig2](c) show the enhancement of the RF signal when the probe laser is on resonance with the red trion (left) or the diagonal (right) transitions, when the pump laser frequency was fixed at Δ  =  0.5GHz. When we scan the pump laser to a final detuning of Δ =  - 2.5GHz, the resulting nuclear spin polarization modifies both the red trion and the diagonal transition resonance frequencies; the change in the red trion (diagonal) resonance is given by ( - δEe(Δ) + δEHH(Δ)) / 2 (( - δEe(Δ) - δEHH(Δ)) / 2), where δEHH(Δ) (δEe(Δ)) denotes the Δ-dependent Overhauser shift seen by a single QD HH (electron). Therefore, by measuring the shift in the corresponding resonances using the probe laser (Fig. [\ref=Fig2](c) bottom trace), we determine the ratio η(Δ) = δEHH(Δ) / δEe(Δ) of the HH and electron Overhauser shifts to be - 0.09. Our experiments reveal that the HH hyperfine interaction has the opposite sign to that of the electron.

The shift in the red trion and the diagonal transition frequencies are extracted by fitting a Lorentzian lineshape to the resonantly enhanced RF signal (Fig. [\ref=Fig2](c)). To confirm that the ratio η(Δ) is in fact independent of the amount of nuclear spin polarization, we repeat the experiment for a range of different Δ values. Figure [\ref=Fig3](a) shows a series of probe scans across the diagonal transition for different pump laser detunings. The extracted transition energies are plotted in Figure [\ref=Fig3](b) (green dots). The red dots in Fig. [\ref=Fig3](b) show the shift of the red trion transition measured using the same technique. Dashed lines are linear fits to the extracted nuclear-spin-polarization-modified resonance frequencies.

The remarkable linear fit to the data in Fig. [\ref=Fig3](b) not only shows that η(Δ)  =  η as we anticipated, but also that both δEHH and δEe scale linearly with the pump-laser detuning. This linear dependence allows us to simply determine the relative strength of the HH hyperfine interaction as η  =   - (α  -  β) / (α  +  β), where α (β) is the slope of the red-trion (diagonal) transition depicted in Fig. [\ref=Fig3](b). Using the measured slope of [formula] for the red line and [formula] for the green line we calculate [formula].

An accurate determination of η requires that scanning the probe laser across the red trion or the diagonal transition does not modify the nuclear spin polarization that was created by the pump laser. A clear signature of probe laser dragging, suggesting a modification of the degree of nuclear spin polarization, is a change in the pump laser induced RF signal, which constitutes the background of the scans shown in figure [\ref=Fig2](b) as the probe laser is scanned across the transition. We choose the power of the probe laser such that there is no measurable change in the background. In addition, the linewidths of the recovered RF signal match the QD transition linewidth at B = 0T, in agreement with the absence of probe induced dragging. Furthermore we repeated the measurement at various probe laser powers; only when the laser power is low enough does the slope become completely independent of laser power. Figure [\ref=Fig4](a) shows the Overhauser shifts of the vertical and diagonal transitions, each for two different probe laser powers indicated on the graph. The measured slopes at different powers are indeed in excellent agreement. The oscillator strength of the diagonal transition is much weaker than that of the red trion transition, requiring higher probe laser powers to induce resonant spin pumping. By repeating the diagonal transition Overhauser shift measurements for two different gate voltages, 1mV apart, around the gate voltage indicated by the dashed line on Fig. [\ref=Fig1](b) (blue traces on Fig. [\ref=Fig4](a)), we have also confirmed that the slopes we determined do not depend on the gate voltage. The latter measurements also suggest that small changes in the charging environment and the resulting changes in the confined electron and HH wave-functions do not alter the ratio η. The ratio η also shows no appreciable dependence on the strength of the external magnetic field (Fig. [\ref=Fig4](a) inset).

Due to the large variation in HH g-factor and the positively-charged trion confinement energy, it is generally believed that the confined HH wave-function could change substantially from one QD to another. To determine if these changes lead to a modification of HH-hyperfine interaction, we have repeated our experiments on two other QDs. Figure [\ref=Fig4](b) shows measurements on a second QD which yields η =  - 0.09  ±  0.02. The ratio for a third QD, determined with a factor 2.5 lower accuracy, yielded η  ~   - 0.1. Remarkably, we find that the strength of the HH-hyperfine interaction in these 3 QDs to be almost identical, even though their HH longitudinal g-factors vary substantially (Fig. [\ref=Fig4](b)).

Despite the accurate measurement of the Overhauser shift of the HH and the electron that we have demonstrated, it is not straightforward to use our data to extract the actual HH hyperfine interaction constant with high accuracy due to differences in the confined electron and the HH envelope wave-functions. The exact mechanism behind dragging of QD resonances is not well understood; however, it is safe to assume that the underlying nuclear spin polarization is mainly mediated by the electron . The precise magnitude of the HH Overhauser shift is therefore influenced by the overlap between the electron and hole wave-functions and their confinement length-scales. Repeating the experiments on different QDs, particularly those with vastly different in-plane g-factors, would yield further information about the sensitivity of η to the HH confinement.

The striking feature of our experiments is the (almost) perfect linear dependence of the Overhauser shift on the pump-laser detuning. What is even more remarkable is the fact that the slope of the red trion energy shift is ~  1, indicating that the Overhauser shift of the blue trion transition satisfies (-  δEe(Δ) + δEHH(Δ)) / 2  =  Δ  +  c, where c is a constant much smaller than the bare optical transition linewidth. On the other hand theoretical models proposed to explain dragging showed a finite dependence of the absorption contrast on the bare laser detuning [\cite=Latta:2009] [\cite=Yang:2010], suggesting that the amount of nuclear spin polarization has a non-trivial dependence on the applied laser frequency. The experimental techniques developed here could therefore help in identifying the physical mechanisms underlying the dragging of QD resonances.

In summary, we have developed a new measurement technique combining two recent advances in QD physics to determine the strength of the HH hyperfine interaction. Our measurements on highly strained self-assembled QDs indicate a coupling strength that is about a factor of 2 smaller than what has been predicted theoretically for strain-free GaAs QDs, and provide further support for efforts aimed at using confined HH pseudo-spins as qubits in solid-state quantum information processing.
