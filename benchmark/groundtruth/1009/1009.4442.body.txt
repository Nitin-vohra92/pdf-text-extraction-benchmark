A Bourgain type bilinear estimate for a class of water-wave models

We consider the general form of the equation of water-wave models on torus [formula]

[formula]

where Q denotes nonlinear term of the equation and bks are real constants. This equation was first introduced and studied by [\cite=l1] on the real line. The symbol of the linear partial differential operator [formula] is

[formula]

where [formula] and ck = ( - 1)k(2π)2k + 1bk. We assume [formula] for all the [formula]. In particular, generalized Kawahara equations [\cite=B1] and fifth-order KdV equations [\cite=K] are the special cases satisfying this condition. We introduce the Bourgain space-time space Xs,b with the norm

[formula]

We are going to establish a bilinear estimate which extends the proposition 7.15 in [\cite=Bo] to the higher order derivatives.

Let functions [formula], we have the bilinear estimate

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and

[formula]

The proof of ([\ref=3]) is reduced to show [formula].

Let quadratic polynomial Q(m,l) = P(m + l) - P(m) - P(l). We have

[formula]

and

[formula]

For a integer j > 0, define Paley-Littlewood operator

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the characteristic function on the set [formula], and set

[formula]

We have the Paley-Littlewood decomposition for um and vm

[formula]

We assert that ([\ref=5]) can be estimated by

[formula]

Since it is easy to see that

[formula]

For the summation over q  ≤  p inside the brackets, take [formula] and [formula] we have [formula]. By this reason, we can write

[formula]

This proves the estimate ([\ref=6]).

We will need the pointwise estimate

[formula]

To prove ([\ref=8]), we shall use Jensen inequality and Plancherel theorem.

[formula]

We distinguish three cases

[formula]

Contribution of [formula]. By ([\ref=8]), we have the estimate

[formula]

By Plancherel theorem we get

[formula]

Estimate ([\ref=9]) implies

[formula]

The last step is followed by Hölder inequality. For [formula], let positive integer |l| = 2j and [formula], we can obtain the estimate

[formula]

Similarly, we have

[formula]

Contribution of [formula]. Consider the quantity

[formula]

We first assume [formula]. For a large positive K > 0, by Plancherel theorem, we write

[formula]

Since [formula], splitting the summation into 62q / |l|2N summations over arithmetic progressions of increment 62q / |l|2N, say Ms for [formula]. if m1, m2∈Ms then

[formula]

where d, n1 and n2 denote be integers and n1 > n2, d < 62q / |l|2N. We write

[formula]

and obviously [formula] for all indices α, β. In this case we have

[formula]

By a orthogonality consideration and ([\ref=10]) we write

[formula]

From Young inequality, ([\ref=12]) and ([\ref=8]) we get

[formula]

Let K  →    ∞  , the estimate holds for the whole integer set. The same estimate can be obtained if we interchange the role of um and vm. As for the case l < 0, by ([\ref=7]) we can reduce this case to [formula].

Therefore, we have

[formula]

Contribution of [formula]. We have known from ([\ref=11]) that the orthogonality seems more natural in this case. The arguments are similar as the case of [formula] and even simpler.

The result is sharp. For example if we take

[formula]

Then [formula] and

[formula]

On the other hand,

[formula]
