Abstract. Bringmann and Lovejoy introduced a rank for overpartition pairs and investigated its role in congruence properties of [formula], the number of overpartition pairs of n. In particular, they applied the theory of Klein forms to show that there exist many Ramanujan-type congruences for the number [formula]. In this paper, we shall derive two Ramanujan-type identities and some explicit congruences for [formula]. Moreover, we find three ranks as combinatorial interpretations of the fact that [formula] is divisible by three for any n. We also construct infinite families of congruences for [formula] modulo 3, 5, and 9.

Introduction

A partition of a positive integer n is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is n. An overpartition λ of n is a partition of n for which the first occurrence of a number may be overlined. Let [formula] denote the number of overpartitions of n. Congruence properties for [formula] have been extensively studied, see, for example, Fortin, Jacob and Mathieu [\cite=FJM05], Hirschhorn and Sellers [\cite=HS05b], Kim [\cite=Kim09], Lovejoy and Osburn [\cite=Lovejoy10], and Mahlburg [\cite=Mahlburg04]. In this paper, we shall be concerned with arithmetic properties of the number of overpartition pairs of n. An overpartition pair π of n is a pair of overpartitions (λ,μ) such that the sum of all of the parts is n. Note that either λ or μ may be an overpartition of zero. We need to pay special attention to the overpartition of zero. There is only one partition of zero, and there is only one overpartition of zero as well. Let [formula] denote the number of overpartition pairs of n. Then the generating function for [formula] is

[formula]

Throughout this paper, we adopt the following standard q-series notation for |q| < 1,

[formula]

Bringmann and Lovejoy [\cite=Lovejoy08] defined a rank for overpartition pairs to investigate congruence properties of [formula]. Let [formula] denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with rank m, and let [formula] denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with rank congruent to r modulo t. They obtained a bivariate generating function for [formula] from which they derived the following relation for 0  ≤  r  ≤  2,

[formula]

This leads to the following Ramanujan-type congruence

[formula]

Furthermore, by using the theory of Klein forms, Bringmann and Lovejoy [\cite=Lovejoy08] proved that there exist infinitely many Ramanujan-type congruences for [formula]. Let l be an odd prime and let t be an odd number which is a power of l or relatively prime to l. Then for any positive integer j, there are infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An  +  B such that

[formula]

for any 0  ≤  r  ≤  t - 1. Hence there are infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An  +  B satisfying

[formula]

for any odd prime l and any positive integer j. For the case l = 2, using the theory of modular forms, they have shown that [\eqref=eqcong] holds for any positive integer j.

However, the theory of Klein forms used to derive the congruence relation [\eqref=eqcong] is not constructive and it does not give explicit arithmetic progressions An + B in the statement. So it is still desirable to find explicit congruences for [formula]. In this paper, we obtain some congruences modulo 3 and 5.

For the case of modulo 3, we obtain a Ramanujan-type identity

[formula]

which implies [\eqref=eqcong3]. Furthermore, we show that there are infinite families of congruences modulo 3 satisfied by [formula]. For example, for any α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

For the case of modulo 5, we obtain three Ramanujan-type congruences

[formula]

for any n  ≥  0. We also obtain infinite families of congruences modulo 5. For example, for any α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

Motivated by the work of Paule and Radu [\cite=Paule09] on some strange congruences in their words, we establish similar congruences for [formula]. For example, for any k  ≥  0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

In order to give combinatorial interpretations of the fact that [formula] is divisible by 3 for any [formula], we find three ranks of overpartition pairs that serve this purpose.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we obtain two Ramanujan-type identities and some Ramanujan-type congruences modulo 5 and 64. In Section 3, we give three combinatorial interpretations for the congruence [\eqref=eqcong3]. Section 4 contains infinite families of congruences modulo 3 and 5. In Section 5 is concerned with congruences modulo 5 and 9 in the flavor of the strange congruences of Paule and Radu.

Ramanujan-type identities and congruences

In this section, we establish two Ramanujan-type identities and derive some congruence relations modulo 5 and 64.

We have

[formula]

To prove the above identities, we recall two Ramanujan's theta functions φ(q) and ψ(q), namely,

[formula]

The following two identities are due to Gauss, see, for example, Berndt [\cite=Berndt06].

[formula]

As shown by Hirschhorn and Sellers [\cite=HS05], the the generating function of [formula] is

[formula]

This implies that the generating function of [formula] equals

[formula]

The following dissection formula of Hirschhorn and Sellers [\cite=HS05] plays a key role in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmRamtypeiden].

[formula]

where

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmRamtypeiden]. Applying the 3-dissection formula [\eqref=eqlem3n] in [\eqref=eqgenpp2], we see that

[formula]

Choosing those terms on each side of the above identity for which the powers of q are of the form 3n + 2 and noting that all the series [\eqref=eqHS1] are functions of q3 if the factors q and q2 are not taken into account, we find that

[formula]

Dividing both sides of the above identity by q2 and replacing q3 by q, we obtain that

[formula]

This yields [\eqref=eq3n+2]. Similarly,

[formula]

Choosing the terms in the above identity for which the powers of q are of the form 4n + 3, we find that

[formula]

Dividing both sides of the above identity by q3 and replacing q4 by q, we deduce that

[formula]

which is equivalent to [\eqref=eq4n+3]. This completes the proof.

In view of Theorem [\ref=thmRamtypeiden], it can be seen that [formula] and [formula] are divisible by 4. In fact, for all n  ≥  1, [formula] is divisible by 4, since

[formula]

Indeed, Keister, Sellers and Vary [\cite=KSV09] have shown that for n  ≥  1,

[formula]

With the aid of [\eqref=eq4n+3] and the following relations for any prime p,

[formula]

we are led to the following congruence relations modulo 5 and 64.

For any nonnegative integer n,

[formula]

Proof.  From [\eqref=eq4n+3] and [\eqref=eqprod1] with p = 2, we have

[formula]

This yields congruence [\eqref=eqcong8n+7] by equating the coefficients of q2n + 1 for n  ≥  0. Again by [\eqref=eq4n+3] and [\eqref=eqprod1] with p = 5, we see that

[formula]

Let p- 2(n) be defined by

[formula]

It has been shown by Ramanathan [\cite=Ramanathan50] that for n  ≥  0,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eqtempthmcong1] and the above three congruences, we deduce the congruence relations [\eqref=eqcong20n+11], [\eqref=eqcong20n+15] and [\eqref=eqcong20n+19]. This completes the proof.

Three ranks for overpartition pairs

In this section, we give three combinatorial interpretations for the fact that [formula] is divisible by 3.

The first rank of an overpartition pair [formula], denoted r1(π), is defined to be n1(λ) - n1(μ), where n1(λ) denotes the number of parts of an overpartition λ. As usual, let R1(m,n) denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with r1(π) = m and let R1(s,t,n) denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with [formula]. By symmetry, we see that R1(m,n) = R1( - m,n), and so R1(s,t,n) = R1(t - s,t,n). It is easy to derive the bivariate generating function for R1(m,n), that is,

[formula]

Here we adopt the convention that the empty overpartition pair of 0 has rank zero and this convention also holds for the other two ranks that will be introduced in this section. The following theorem shows that the rank r1(π) leads to a classification of overpartition pairs of 3n + 2 into three equinumerous sets.

For 0  ≤  s  ≤  2, we have

[formula]

Proof.  Substituting z = ξ = e2πi / 3 into [\eqref=eqrank1] and using the symmetry relation R1(1,3,n) = R1(2,3,n), we find that

[formula]

Here the second equality follows from identity

[formula]

Equating the coefficients of q3n + 2 on both sides of [\eqref=eqrank1b], and observing that there are no squares congruent to 2 modulo 3, we conclude that

[formula]

and so

[formula]

This completes the proof.

We now give the second rank r2. Let π = (λ,μ) be an overpartition pair. Define r2(π) = n2(λ) - n2(μ), where n2(λ) denotes the number of overlined parts of an overpartition λ. Similarly, let R2(m,n) denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with r2(π) = m and let R2(s,t,n) denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with [formula]. Then we have the following relation.

For n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

Proof.  It is routine to check that

[formula]

Using the fact that R2(1,3,n) = R2(2,3,n) and setting z = ξ = e2πi / 3 in [\eqref=eqrank2a], we find

[formula]

Since there are no squares congruent to 2 modulo 3, we see that

[formula]

and hence the proof is complete.

It is worth mentioning that Andrews, Lewis and Lovejoy [\cite=ALL02] investigated the arithmetic properties of the number PD(n) of partitions of n with designated summands, whose generating function is given by [\eqref=eqrank2b], that is,

[formula]

For example, it has been shown that PD(3n + 2) is divisible by three. It should also be mentioned that Chan [\cite=Chan08] studied the number a(n) given by

[formula]

and derived a Ramanujan-type identity for a(3n + 2), that is,

[formula]

From [\eqref=eqrank2b] and [\eqref=eqChan], we get the following formula.

We have

[formula]

Finally, we turn to the third rank r3 of an overpartition pair π = (λ,μ), which is defined by r3(π) = n3(λ) - n3(μ), where n3(λ) denotes the number of non-overlined parts of an overpartition λ. Similarly, let R3(m,n) denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with r3(π) = m and let R3(s,t,n) denote the number of overpartition pairs of n with [formula]. Then we have the following theorem.

For 0  ≤  s  ≤  2, we have

[formula]

Proof.  It is easy to derive that

[formula]

Using the fact that R3(1,3,n) = R3(2,3,n) and setting z = ξ = e2πi / 3 in [\eqref=eqrank3a], we find that

[formula]

Note that there are no triangular numbers that is congruent to 2 modulo 3. It follows that

[formula]

Since R3(1,3,3n + 2) = R3(2,3,3n + 2), the proof is complete.

To conclude this section, we remark that the rank r3 can be used to give combinatorial explanations of many Ramanujan-type congruences for [formula] which plays an analogous role to the rank introduced by Bringmann and Lovejoy [\cite=Lovejoy08] for congruences also for overpartition pairs. To be specific, we have the following theorem. The proof is similar to the proof of Bringmann and Lovejoy. But the rank r3 seems to simpler.

Let l be an odd prime, and let t be an odd number which is a power of l or relatively prime to l. Then for any positive integer j, there are infinitely many non-nested arithmetic progressions An  +  B such that

[formula]

for any 0  ≤  r  ≤  t - 1.

Proof.  Note that the generating function for R3(s,t,n) can be decomposed into a linear combination of certain modular forms similar to the case for [formula]. Suppose that t is an odd integer and 0  ≤  s < t. Let [formula], and let C(s,t) be the constant given by

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

Observe that R3(ζkt;q) differs from R(ζkt;q) (see Bringmann and Lovejoy [\cite=Lovejoy08]) only by a factor [formula]. Hence the argument of Bringmann and Lovejoy for [\eqref=eqrankcong] can be carried over to deduce relation [\eqref=eqcongrank3]. This completes the proof.

Infinite families of congruences modulo 3 and 5

In this section, we obtain a formula for [formula] modulo 3 based on the number of representations of n as a sum of two squares. We further derive a formula for [formula] modulo 5 in connection with the number of representations of n in the form x2 + 5y2. As consequences, we give infinite families of congruences modulo 3 and 5.

If the prime factorization of n is given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Proof.  First, it is easy to see that

[formula]

and

[formula]

where B(q) is a infinite series in q with integer coefficients . Hence,

[formula]

Extracting the terms q3n for n  ≥  0, and replacing q3 by q, we find that

[formula]

Let r2(n) denote the number of representations of n as a sum of two squares. So we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=eqpp3na]) and ([\ref=eqpp3nb]) it follows that

[formula]

Given the prime factorization of n in the form of [\eqref=eqfacn1], it is well known that

[formula]

see, for example, Berndt [\cite=Berndt06] or Grosswald [\cite=Grosswald84]. Combining ([\ref=eqpp3nc]) and ([\ref=eqpp3nd]), we get the desired formula ([\ref=eqpp3n]).

Assume that p is prime with [formula], and s is an integer with 1  ≤  s < p. Then for any α  ≥  0 and n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

In particular, setting p = 3, we have for any α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0,

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof.  Recall that r2(n) = 0 if and only if there exists a prime congruent to 3 modulo 4 that has an odd exponent in the canonical factorization of n. It can be seen that

[formula]

since p is not a factor of pn + s. By [\eqref=eqpp3nc] we obtain the congruence relation [\eqref=eqp^a]. This completes the proof.

Let R(n,x2 + 5y2) denote the number of representations of n by the quadratic form x2 + 5y2. Then for any n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

To prove this theorem, we need a simple property of a Lambert series on the right-hand side of [\eqref=eqlem].

Let 1  ≤  r  ≤  4 and let the numbers ar(n) be given by

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Proof.  Let r8(n) denote the number of representations of n as a sum of eight squares, namely,

[formula]

Using the generating function ([\ref=eqgenpp2]) for [formula], we have

[formula]

In view of relation ([\ref=eqpp5a]) and the fact that

[formula]

from [\eqref=eqpp5b] we see that

[formula]

Choosing the terms for which the power of q is a multiple of 5, we find that

[formula]

Replacing q5 by q in [\eqref=eqpp5c] gives

[formula]

We wish to establish the following congruence

[formula]

To this end, we recall that

[formula]

see Berndt [\cite=Berndt06]. It follows that

[formula]

For r = 1,2,3,4, let ar(n) be defined by ([\ref=eqlem]). By ([\ref=eqpp5a]), the above relation ([\ref=eqsquare8a]) can be rewritten as

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lemaar], we find that

[formula]

By [\eqref=eqsquare8b] and [\eqref=eqsquare8c] we obtain [\eqref=eqr5n]. From [\eqref=eqpp5d] and [\eqref=eqr5n] we know that

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

By the definition of R(n,x2 + 5y2), we see that

[formula]

As a consequence of [\eqref=eqpp5e] and [\eqref=eqpp5f], we deduce that

[formula]

Thus the proof is complete by equating coefficients.

The formula for R(n,x2 + 5y2) due to Berkovich and Yesilyurt [\cite=berkovich09] leads to the following formula for [formula] modulo 5.

If the prime factorization of n is given by

[formula]

where [formula], or 9 ( mod  20) and [formula], or 19 ( mod  20). Then we have

[formula]

where t is the number of prime factors of n, counting multiplicity, that are congruent to 3 or 7 modulo 20.

Proof.  Given the prime factorization of n in the form of [\eqref=eqfacn2], it is known that

[formula]

see, for example, Berkovich and Yesilyurt [\cite=berkovich09]. Combining [\eqref=eqthmpp5n] and ([\ref=eqR]), we get ([\ref=eqcong5n]). This completes the proof.

Based on the above theorem, we establish two infinite families of congruences modulo 5.

For any α  ≥  1 and n  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Proof.  Considering the possible residues of x2 + 5y2 modulo 5, we find that

[formula]

In light of [\eqref=eqthmpp5n], we deduce that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Observe that formula [\eqref=eqcong5n] for [formula] modulo 5 is independent of the exponent of 5 in the factorization of n. This means that for α  ≥  1,

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eqR5n+2], [\eqref=eqR5n+3] and [\eqref=eqcong5^a3], we obtain the desired congruence relations ([\ref=eqcong5^a1]) and ([\ref=eqcong5^a2]). This completes the proof.

Further congruences for overpartition pairs

In this section, we shall establish some congruences for [formula] modulo 5 and 9 which are similar to the congruences for the number of broken 2-diamonds partitions derived by Paule and Radu [\cite=Paule09]. Let us begin with the congruences modulo 9 which are derived from congruences modulo 3.

For any prime with [formula], we have

[formula]

for all positive integers n such that [formula].

To prove the above theorem, we need the following lemma which is a special case of Newman [\cite=Newman59].

For each prime p with [formula] and for all positive integers n,

[formula]

where b(n) is defined by

[formula]

Since the equality is derived by equating coefficients of series in q, it is safe to assume that b(t) = 0 if t is not a nonnegative integer. We are now ready to give a proof of Theorem [\ref=thmstrange1].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmstrange1]. By the generating function of [formula] as given in [\eqref=eq3n+2], we see that

[formula]

From the definition of b(n), we deduce that for n  ≥  0,

[formula]

On the other hand, for those prime p with [formula] and those n such that 3n + 2 is not a multiple of p, it follows that [formula]. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=lemnewman1] we obtain

[formula]

Substituting [\eqref=eqstrange1a] into [\eqref=eqstrange1b], we get

[formula]

as required.

Next, we use Lemma [\ref=lemnewman1] to obtain the following congruences. Such type of congruences are called strange congruences by Paule and Radu [\cite=Paule09].

For any k  ≥  0, we have

[formula]

Proof.  Let p be a prime with [formula]. Then setting n = 2(pk + 1 - 1) / 3 in [\eqref=eqnewman1] and using [\eqref=eqstrange1a], we get

[formula]

When p = 13, since [formula], we deduce that

[formula]

Given the initial conditions [formula], [formula], by iteration of [\eqref=eqcong13^a], we reach the conclusion [\eqref=eqstrange2a]. This completes the proof.

We now turn to the congruences modulo 5.

Let p be a prime with [formula] or [formula]. Then the following congruence holds any positive integer n that is not divisible by p,

[formula]

The following lemma is a special case of Newman [\cite=Newman59], which will be needed in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thmstrange3].

For each prime p with [formula] and for all positive integers n,

[formula]

where c(n) is defined by

[formula]

Like the case for Lemma [\ref=lemnewman1], we may assume that c(t) = 0 if t is not a nonnegative integer.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thmstrange3]. Recall the following relation as given in [\eqref=eqpp5e],

[formula]

From the definition of c(n), we see that for n  ≥  0,

[formula]

On the other hand, for any prime p with [formula] or [formula], and for any n that is not a multiple of p, we have c(n / p) = 0. Thus, by Lemma [\ref=lemnewman2] we obtain that

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=eqstrange3a] and [\eqref=eqstrange3b], we get

[formula]

Since p2 + 1 is a multiple of 5 if p is a prime of the form 20k + 13 or 20k + 17, the above congruence reduces to

[formula]

This completes the proof.

To conclude this section, we use Lemma [\ref=lemnewman2] to derive the following congruences.

Let p be a prime with [formula] or [formula]. Then the following congruence holds for any positive integer k,

[formula]

Proof.  Applying [\eqref=eqnewman2] with n = pk + 1 and using [\eqref=eqstrange3a], we get

[formula]

It is easily seen that [formula]. From [\eqref=eqstrange4a] we see that

[formula]

Setting n = 1 in [\eqref=eqstrange3c], we get

[formula]

Since [formula], so [formula]. By iteration of [\eqref=eqstrange4b], we arrive at the desired congruence, and hence the proof is complete.
