Molecular lines as tracers of Compton-thick AGN ?

Introduction

X-ray surveys provide the most efficient tool for identifying AGN [\citep=Brandt2005]. This is because the hard X-rays can penetrate large amounts of dust and gas and thus can reveal hidden AGN which would be very difficult to detect at optical wavelengths. However, even the hardest X-rays cannot easily escape from very large absorbing column densities, > 1024 cm- 2  ~  , [\citep=Murphy2009]. A column density of a few times 1024 cm- 2  ~   absorbs X-rays up to 20 keV, while for column densities higher than 1025 cm- 2  ~   practically all X-ray photons are attenuated. Such immense column densities (> 1024 cm- 2  ~  ) correspond to the so-called Compton-thick AGN, where Compton scattering becomes the dominant attenuation process. In these cases, reflected emission from the backside of the obscuring screen, in a form of a torus, remains the only evidence of the AGN presence in X-rays [\citep=Matt2004].

Such extreme column densities could be relatively easily explored in the IR or sub-mm part of the spectrum, through their thermal or molecular emission. For example, sub-mm observations have drawn much attention recently as a means of discovering heavily obscured AGN [\citep=Alexander2005]. The discovery of significant dust optical depths even at submillimeter wavelengths [\citep=Sakamoto2008] reveals that such highly obscured systems may not be uncommon. Recently, [\citet=Papadopoulos2010] (hereafter P10) made the interesting suggestion that observations of suitable molecular lines can reveal cases of very high column densities (and thus possible obscuration) present in some reservoirs of molecular gas in LIRGs. The average molecular gas densities in some of these systems can be so high that if the gas is distributed in a gaseous disk it can yield extremely high column densities and dust optical depths that suppress the high-J (6-5) CO line emission to levels well below those expected in starburst galaxies such as ULIRGs. In such cases, if an active galactic nucleus were embedded in the (U)LIRG, the line of sight towards it would also be severely obscured making this source Compton-thick. A molecular line diagnostic to identify such severely obscured sources was proposed by P10. This helps distinguish between the degenerate possibilities of high dust obscuration and large reservoirs of non star-forming cool and diffuse gas, whose high-J (6-5) CO lines are genuinely faint rather than immersed to a strong dust continuum. They suggest that high fractions of very dense molecular gas (with n(H2) > 104  cm- 3) can be traced by a high HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) ratio (R>  0.1). Then a low (R < 0.3) CO(6-5)/(3-2) ratio can only be the result of high dust optical depths (τ434μm  ~  1). Consequently there should be a very high probability of Compton-thick AGN for (U)LIRG hosts lying inside their aforementioned selection "window". On the other hand, we note that gaseous disks (in the center of which the AGN are presumably embedded) with low average column densities can often yield large column densities along the particular line of sight towards the AGN as a result of their highly turbulent nature . Thus Compton-thick sources can be expected also outside the dust-obscuration selection window, the vast majority of sources inside it however should be Compton thick. In other words, if molecular gas disks have on average high column densities, as the supression of CO J=6-5 emission from their star-forming gas would imply, this will almost certainly be the case for the special line of sight towards the AGN as well, but the reverse does not necessarily hold. Thus the selection window of highly dust obscured star-forming systems advocated by P10 ought to select almost exclusively Compton-thick AGN, but not all of them.

In this paper we are examining the X-ray properties of the systems in P10, using both literature spectra as well as Chandra  archival observations. Our goal is to test whether AGN residing in the P10 box have a higher probability for being classified as Compton-thick sources in X-rays. We adopt Ho  =  75  km  s- 1  Mpc- 1, ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 throughout the paper.

Data & analysis

The sample

P10 present molecular line spectra for 20 (U)LIRGs. For six objects there are no HCN observations available so that the HCN/CO vs. CO(6-5)/CO(3-2) diagnostic cannot be applied. For the remaining 14 objects there are X-ray spectra available either in the literature or in publicly available Chandra  observations. Although in many cases the Chandra  observations may have been presented elsewhere, we chose to re-analyze the data in order to provide a uniform analysis of the sample. To our knowledge, in six cases X-ray spectral fits to the Chandra  data are presented here for the first time: VII Zw 031, IRAS 10565+2448, IRAS 12112+0305, Arp 193, IRAS 17208-0014, IRAS 23365+3604. However, X-ray luminosities or hardness ratios derived from Chandra  observations have been presented before in the literature for some of those (see Table [\ref=xrayprop]). In the cases of Mrk 231, NGC 6240 and NGC 7469, where there are high signal-to-noise spectra in the 2 - 100 keV band reported in the literature from BeppoSAX, we prefer to present that data instead, as high energy observations can be much more efficient in detecting Compton-thick sources.

Spectral fits

We fit the Chandra data in the 0.5-10 keV band using XSPEC v.12.6 [\citep=Arnaud1996]. Initially, we fit an absorbed power-law model to the spectra. For more complex spectra, and judging on the basis of the data residuals from the model fit, we additionally fit a thermal component (Raymond-Smith) to account for X-ray emission from star-forming processes, and/or an FeKα line around 6.4 keV. The C-statistic has been employed [\citep=Cash1979]. The errors correspond to the 90% confidence level as is customary in X-ray Astronomy. The X-ray spectral properties and luminosities are presented in Table [\ref=xrayprop]. In the Chandra  data presented here, an FeKα line has been detected in the case of the sources IRAS 09320+6134 (see discussion below) and the Seyfert-2 galaxy Mrk 273. An in-depth presentation of the Chandra  spectrum of this source can be found in [\citet=Xia2002] and [\citet=Ptak2003].

We use the following criteria to classify a source as Compton-thick: a) the detection of an absorption turnover b) a flat X-ray spectrum with Γ  ~  1 or flatter, suggestive of a reflection-dominted spectrum, or finally c) a high EW ( > 0.8  keV) FeKα line, indicating a strongly absorbed continuum [\citep=Matt2004] [\citep=Akylas2009] [\citep=Georgantopoulos2009] On the basis of the above criteria, we consider four Compton-thick sources: IRAS 09320+6134, Mrk 231, Arp 220, and NGC 6240. In the cases of Mrk 231 and NGC 6240 the absorption turnovers have been directly detected by BeppoSAX ([\citealt=Braito2004] and [\citealt=Vignati1999] respectively) and therefore these can be considered as bona-fide Compton-thick sources. In the case of Arp 220, the spectrum is flat (Γ  ~  1.1) but no Fe line can be detected in the Chandra  data. However, in the XMM-Newton  data [\citep=Iwasawa2005] a high EW (1.9 keV) FeKα line at 6.7 keV has been clearly detected rendering this source a highly probable Compton-thick source. The case of IRAS 09320+6134 (UGC 5101) is the most ambiguous one; we detect a flat spectrum (Γ  ~  1.2), albeit with a large uncertainty, together with a high EW (  ~  3.6  keV) FeKα line. The combination of a flat spectrum with a high EW FeKα line rather points towards a Compton-thick AGN. The EW derived here is consistent with the EW obtained by [\citet=Ptak2003]. [\citet=Imanishi2003] analyse both the XMM-Newton  and the Chandra  data finding a considerably lower EW (  ~  400  eV). Finally, [\citet=Gonzalez-Martin2009] claim the detection of a mildly Compton-thick AGN with a column density of NH  ≈  1.4+ 0.4- 0.04  ×  1024 cm- 2  ~  . Finally, in the case of IRAS 23365+3604, the spectrum is flat but with a large uncertainty. Moreover, there is no evidence for a high-EW FeKα line, therefore the possibility that this source is Compton-thick is weaker.

Galaxies or AGN ?

From Table 1 we see that a large number of sources (with the exception of Mrk 273, IRAS 05189-2524 and the four Compton-thick AGN) are unobscured having column densities NH < 1022 cm- 2  ~  . It is possible that in a number of these sources the X-ray emission comes from star-forming processes rather than the AGN. In order to explore this issue, we are plotting the observed (uncorrected for obscuration) X-ray luminosity against the far-IR luminosity in Figure [\ref=ranalli]. have found a strong correlation between the X-ray and the far-IR luminosity for star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. This implies that sources with an excess of X-ray emission above this relation can be securely associated with AGN. The sources that fall within the [\citet=Ranalli2003] relation should be either 'normal' galaxies (i.e. without an AGN) or highly obscured (Compton-thick) AGN. From Fig. [\ref=ranalli] we see that three sources (IRAS 05189-2524, Mrk 273 and NGC 7469) present X-ray emission above that of 'normal' galaxies.

In order to further investigate the energy mechanism of the sources which lie in the window proposed by P10, we use the mid-IR diagnostic diagram of [\citet=Laurent2000]. This traces the excess of the 5.5 μm continuum emission with respect to the 15 μm continuum and 6.2 μm PAH emission; essentially it is a tracer of hot dust from the AGN which has a higher 5.5 μm/15 μm flux ratio than the cooler dust associated with H II regions, and low 6.2 μm PAH flux. The sources within the P10 box, namely Mrk 273, IRAS 09320+6134, IRAS 10565+2448, Arp 220, IRAS 17208-0014, IRAS 12112+0305, IRAS 23365+3604, show a fractional AGN contribution of 77%, 80%, 5%, 60%, 14%, 21% and 22% respectively [\citep=Armus2007]. For comparison, we note that the two Compton-thick AGN outside the box (Mrk 231 and NGC 6240) show AGN contributions of 95% and 50% respectively [\citep=Armus2007].

In Table [\ref=agn_diagnostics] we summarize the results of the AGN diagnostics used to examine the nature of the sources in the P10 box. There is an agreement between the mid-IR and the X-ray diagnostics which find that 3/7 sources host an AGN, if we use a 50% as a threshold for the [\citet=Laurent2000] diagnostic. We note that one source (IRAS 12112+0305) has been observed with the VLA [\citep=Nagar2003]. This source, which is optically classified as a LINER, appears to show a radio core at 15 GHz with a radio power of [formula]. Therefore, the possibility that this source hosts a Compton-thick AGN cannot be securely excluded.

Discussion & Conclusions

In Figure [\ref=box] we present the diagnostic diagram of P10. We see that out of the four Compton-thick sources (marked with crosses), two (IRAS 09320+6134 and Arp 220) fall within the 'high dust obscuration' window. The other one (NGC 6240) lies very close to the box having a marginally lower HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) ratio. The fourth source (Mrk 231) lies away from the box showing highly excited CO lines and a high HCN/CO J=1-0 line ratio. This presents no fundamental problem in the Compton-thick selection using molecular lines, as Compton-thick AGN are expected also to lie outside the 'window' of the diagnostic diagram of P10. Moreover, this source displays peculiar characteristics relative to the other three Compton-thick sources: although it is a bona-fide Compton-thick source, it is a broad absorption line (BAL) QSO. BAL is a special class of QSOs that show highly ionized gas flowing away from the central source with speeds in some cases exceeding 30000 km  s- 1. Most BAL QSOs present high obscuring columns in X-rays but still their broad-line-regions are viewed relatively unobscured by dust, probably meaning that their dense obscuring medium is dust-free [\citep=VeronCetty2000]. It is then reasonable that in the case of Mrk 231 the high CO(6-5)/CO(3-2) ratio implies that the CO emission is not suppressed by dust, despite the presence of a large X-ray obscuring column density.

In addition, the question that needs to be addressed is what is the nature of the remaining sources within the P10 'high dust obscuration' box. Apart from the two Compton-thick AGN there are five more sources presenting characteristically low CO(6-5)/CO(3-2) ratios in combination with high HCN/CO J=1-0 ones. These are Mrk 273, IRAS 17208-0014, IRAS 10565+2448, IRAS 23365+3604, and IRAS 12112+0305. Among them only Mrk 273 has a known X-ray luminous, highly obscured (NH  ~  4  ×  1023 cm- 2  ~  ), but not Compton-thick AGN. Thus total mean column density of a gaseous disk around the AGN that would be responsible for its X-ray obscuration would be  < NH(disk) >   ~  2xNH  =  8  ×  1023cm- 2. On the other hand mean �disk column densities as low as  < NH(disk) >  = 5.2  ×  1024cm- 2 are compatible with the observed suppression of the CO 6-5/3-2 ratio in this object, which are 6.5 times higher than the one deduced by the X-ray data. This discrepancy, �while not very large given the totally independent means used to obtain  < NH(disk) >  (molecular lines vs X-rays), remains considerable. However, we note that the large difficulty of measuring CO J=6-5 fluxes from the Earth, with a large telescope like the JCMT, will more often yield underestimates rather than overestimates (as pointing errors become substantial with respect to narrow beams used). This could tend to make molecular line-deduced and X-ray-deduced hydrogen column densities more compatible in cases like Mrk 273.

The X-ray emission of the remaining four sources in the box is probably dominated by star-forming processes according to their X-ray spectra, the LX - LFIR relation and the MIR diagnostics of [\citet=Laurent2000]. This could explain why the sources do not appear as Compton-thick in X-ray wavelengths, as the origin of the X-rays is not a potentially deeply buried AGN but stellar. Thus such sources are not useful in deducing mean column densities of gaseous disks around AGN (and could be indeed found inside the selection "window" of P10 without invalidating its utility).

As a consistency check it is interesting to discuss the Si 9.7  μm properties of the objects within the P10 box, as it is clearly impossible that these have substantial dust optical depths in short sub-mm wavelengths as suggested by P10, while at the same time they exhibit modest or low Si (9.7μm) optical depths [\citep=Shi2006]. Therefore the highly obscured objects according to P10 should present large Si optical depths. There are Spitzer-IRS spectroscopic observations for four sources in the P10 box: Mrk 273, IRAS 09320+6134, Arp 220 and IRAS 12112+0305 [\citep=Armus2007]. Their Si (6.7  μm) optical depths are high: 1.8±  0.4, 1.6±  0.3, 3.3±  0.2 and 1.3±  0.3 respectively. This clearly suggests an association of all the sources in the P10 box with optically-thick systems at 9.7  μm.

In conclusion, our results show that the diagnostic proposed by P10 offers a potentially useful tool for the detection of highly obscured X-ray luminous AGN . This bears important implications for future facilities such as ALMA. However, our work identified two caveats. First, the AGN inside the P10 box are heavily obscured but not necessarily Compton-thick, as the case of Mrk273 implies. Second, there can be large contaminations by powerful star-forming systems. Additional X-ray spectral observations might be necessary in order to sift those out. More molecular line data, ranging from low to high-J CO lines, as well as low-frequency (and thus unaffected by dust exinction) density indicators, such as low-to-modest-J HCN and CS lines of nearby (U)LIRGs are needed (along with X-ray data) to verify (or not) this picture in local (U)LIRGs that are known to have X-ray luminous AGN. The now superbly operating Herschel Space Observatory that can detect numerous high-J CO lines in local (U)LIRGs [\citep=vanderWerf2010] in combination with ground based low-J CO and HCN, CS observations presents an excellent opportunity to do so. The large (U)LIRG sample now being observed as part of the Herschel Key Project HerCULES, in combination with the extensive ground-based low frequency CO and HCN survey will be ideal for such studies.
