CME on CME interaction on January� 17,� 2005

Overview of the Event-Origin of the Radio Signatures

The complex event on� January� 17, 2005 was observed with� the� radio-spectrograph ARTEMIS-IV [\citep=Caroubalos01], the Nan cay Radioheliograph [\citep=Kerdraon97], the WIND WAVES [\citep=Bougeret95] and the GOES, EIT and LASCO [\citep=Yashiro04]. The most important radio bursts were two Type IIIGGs, two type II shocks and a long lasting type IV continuum which covered the ARTEMIS-IV/WIND/WAVES spectral range for hours; the EIT & NRH images indicate that they all originated near AR 720.

The GOES records report an X3.8 SXR flare from 06:59 UT to 10:07 UT, with maximum at 09:52 UT. The halo CME1 was first recorded by LASCO at 09:30:05 UT; it was launched around 09:00:47 UT. The next CME2 was first recorded at 09:54 UT and was launched around 09:38:25 UT; it was found to overtake CME1 at about 12:45 UT at a height of approximate 37 solar radii. The interaction of two fast CMEs (the speed of CME1 was 2094 km/  sec & the speed of CME2 2547 km/  sec) is at variance with previous works [\citep=Gopalswamy01] [\citep=Lehtinen05] that focus on fast-slow CME interaction.

The type II shocks were recorded by the WIND/WAVES; their extensions into the high frequencies are probably masked within the type IV continuum (Fig. [\ref=F3]). The frequency�-time plots of CME1 and CME2 fronts were calculated from the LASCO Height vs. Time Plots and the Hybrid Coronal Density Model of [\citet=Vrsnak04]; they are well associated with the type II lanes and are thus interpreted both as CME Bow Shocks. As they approach each other (at about 11:37 UT) a low frequency type III-like burst is recorded, probably tracing shock accelerated energetic electrons. The CME1 & CME2 lift-off is well associated, in time, with the two stages of the X3.8 SXR flux rise.

The two type III groups (08:41-09:42 UT), lastly, are also well associated with the two stages of the X3.8 SXR flux rise, therefore appears that their exciter electrons originated in the low corona during the impulsive phase of the flare.
