Antisite Domains in Double Perovskite Ferromagnets: Impact on Magnetotransport and Half-metallicity

Model and method

The ASD arises from an annealing process, and is spatially correlated [\cite=asaka-asd-dom] [\cite=dd-asd-dom] rather than random. Generating antisite disordered configurations that incorporate the detailed B, B' chemistry and capture specific preparative conditions is difficult. However, one can model the inherent ordering tendency in the B, B' system, and frustrate it via poor annealing to mimic the situation in the material. Using the structural motifs that emerge [\cite=ps-pm-asd] we can then solve the coupled electronic-magnetic problem through a real space technique.

We use a binary variable ηi to encode information about atomic positions. We set ηi = 1 for B sites and ηi = 0 for B' sites. In a non disordered DP the ηi will alternate along each axis. We will consider spatially correlated disordered configurations of η, discussed later, and for any specified {η} background the electronic-magnetic model has the form:

[formula]

Here f is the electron operator corresponding to the magnetic B site and m is that of the non-magnetic B' site. εB and εB' are onsite energies, at the B and B' sites respectively. εB  -  εB' is a 'charge transfer' energy. Hkin is the electron hopping term: [formula] [formula] [formula]. The t's are all nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes, and for simplicity we set t1 = t2 = t3 = t here. [formula] is the core spin on the site [formula], and [formula]. J is the Hund's coupling on the B sites, and we use J / t  ≫  1. When the 'up spin' core levels are fully filled, as for Fe in SFMO, the conduction electron is forced to be antiparallel to the core spin. We have used J > 0 to model this situation. For the present study we have set [\cite=delta-ref] the effective charge transfer energy εB - J / 2  -  εB' = 0.

If two magnetic atoms are on neighbouring sites, we also have to consider the antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between them. Much of the physics of these materials arises from the competition between delocalisation driven ferromagnetic exchange and this B-B superexchange. We set JAFS2 / t  =  0.08, based on the TN scale in SrFeO3. h is an applied magnetic field in the ẑ direction

The model above treats the variables ηi as given. What governs the distribution of ionic positions {ηi}? The effective interaction between ions has a 'direct' component (Lennard-Jones, say) that we label Vion. There is also the indirect interaction via the electronic-magnetic degrees of freedom in H{ηi}. The total Hamiltonian, including all degrees of freedom, would be: Htot  =  H{ηi}  +  Vion{ηi}. To obtain the effective interaction among the {ηi} one should trace out the electronic and magnetic variables. So, the effective potential Veff{η} controlling the positional order is [formula] Unfortunately there is limited information about Vion, and the trace is computationally demanding. Thankfully, the experiments themselves suggest a way ahead.

Firstly, the structural degrees of freedom 'freeze' at a temperature Tord  ~  1000K ≫  Tc  ~  400K, where Tc is the magnetic ordering temperature, so we need not bother about the 'feedback' of magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom on the {ηi} ordering. Secondly, the tendency is to order into an alternating pattern, frustrated by short annealing. So, as a first attempt, we can try out a simple short range model with the same tendency. Concretely, we use a 'lattice gas' model [formula] with V  >  0 being a measure of the ordering tendency. The ground state in this model would correspond to η = 1,0,1,0,.. along each axis, i.e, B, B', B, B',.. This approach tries to incorporate the effect of complex interactions between the A, B, B' and O ions (as also the electrons) into a single parameter V.

We explored [\cite=ps-pm-asd] the consequences of different annealing protocols on this model, to examine the consequences of imperfect annealing. The lattice gas model has a finite temperature transition in both 2D and 3D. We work in 2D since it allows access to large sizes and is easier to visualise.

One can variously characterise the B-B' structures that emerge. We use the following simple indicators, to keep a close correspondence with the experimental work. (i) The fraction of B (or B') atoms that are on the wrong sublattice, call this x, and the structural 'order parameter' S = 1 - 2x. (ii) The degree of short range order, characterised by the probability, p, of having nearest neighbour pairs that are B-B'. (iii) The correlation length ξ in these structures, computed from the width of the ordering peak.

For a given {ηi} configuration we need to solve for the magnetic and electronic properties. Since the background involves strong disorder, and the electron-spin coupling, J, is large, we use an exact diagonalization based Monte Carlo (ED-MC) technique. This uses the Metropolis algorithm where a spin update, [formula] is accepted or rejected depending on ΔE / kBT, where [formula]. In principle we should diagonalise the full system every time an update is attempted. The cost, for a large system, is prohibitive, so we employ a method [\cite=tca] where we diagonalize a cluster Hamiltonian built around the update site.

Electronic properties are calculated after equilibration by diagonalizing the full system. The optical conductivity is calculated via the the Kubo formulation. The 'dc conductivity' is the low frequency average [\cite=cond-calc], [formula], where σ(ω) is thermal and disorder averaged, and Δω  ~  0.05t. Our 'dc resistivity' is the inverse of this σdc. The spin resolved density of states Dσ(ω) is calculated from the single particle Green's function.

Earlier work

The theoretical effort till now [\cite=asd-theor1] [\cite=asd-theor2] has focused on uncorrelated antisite disorder, and quantified the impact of such ASD on magnetic properties. One of them [\cite=asd-theor1] is based on a variational scheme in large 3D systems, and quantifies the doping and antisite concentration dependence of magnetic properties. The other [\cite=asd-theor2] uses a classical spin model for magnetism, and studies the critical properties. These calculations set the reference for magnetic properties but have the obvious limitation that: (i) they use randomly located antisites, (ii) they do not clarify the electronic properties, and (iii) the estimate of localisation effects that arise from structural/magnetic domains, and the possible MR, remains unexplored.

Results

ASD configurations

The ASD configurations can be readily generated through a Monte Carlo on the lattice gas model. Below an ordering temperature Tord  ~  0.7V (in 2D) the model exhibits long range B-B' order provided one anneals long enough. We quench the system from high temperature (random B, B') to Tann  <  Tord, but deliberately anneal it for a short time, preventing equilibriation. The details have been discussed [\cite=ps-pm-asd] in an earlier paper. The four families we chose, see Fig.1, have a fraction of mislocated sites: x  =  0.01, ~ 0.12, ~ 0.25, ~ 0.46. The patterns, however, are strongly correlated. Even in the most disordered samples (lowest row in Fig.1) where the likelihood of any site being B or B' is ~  0.5, if a site is B, say, there is a high likelihood that its neighbours will be B' (and vice versa). Following recent experimental work [\cite=dd-asd-dom], we calculate the probability p of having B-B' nearest neighbours as a measure of short range correlation. In a perfectly ordered sample this would be 1 (the B, B' alternate) while in a completely disordered sample this is 0.5. For an uncorrelated B, B' distribution this is puncorr  =  x2  +  (1 - x)2  =  (1 / 2)(1  +  S2). If we only knew S, these would lead to puncorr  =  0.98, ~ 0.79, ~ 0.63, ~ 0.50 for the x that we have used. The values that actually emerge from analysing our correlated patterns, are pcorr  ~  0.98, ~ 0.97, ~ 0.95, ~ 0.86. Even the most disordered samples have a high degree of short range order. A Lorenztian fit to the B-B' structure factor, of the form [formula], yields ξ  ~  6.6, ~ 5.9, ~ 4.8, ~ 3.6.

Disorder dependence at T = 0

Let us examine the effect of the ASD on the magnetic properties. Suppose the fraction of mislocated B, B' sites is x, and the structure is organised into domains such that the ratio of 'perimeter' to 'bulk' sites is small. The AF coupling between adjoining domains would polarise them antiparallel, and the net moment at T = 0, ~ h = 0 would be proportional to the volume difference of up and down domains. We should have M(T = 0,h = 0)  ~  (1  -  x)  -  x  =  1  -  2x  =  S so M2  =  S2. Given our S, these are 0.96, ~ 0.58, ~ 0.25, ~ 0.01 in almost perfect correspondence with the T  →  0 values in Fig.2.(a). The elaborate calculation arrives at an obvious answer. The onset temperature for magnetic order seems to be insensitive to the ASD, i.e., the intra-domain order sets in at T  ~   the bulk Tc. While our answer for the suppression of magnetisation is M  ~  1 - 2x, a 3D calculation, with uncorrelated disorder, had found [\cite=asd-theor1] M  ~  1  -  1.9x.

The transport in these background is shown in Fig.2.(b). From weak to intermediate ASD the temperature dependence of ρ(T) remains similar, with a sharp drop near Tc. The only effect of increasing ASD is an increase in residual resistivity. It is as if there is a temperature independent 'structural' scattering that gets added to the T dependent magnetic scattering. At large ASD, however, this correspondence breaks down, the T = 0 'resistivity' is very large (and grows with growing system size) and dρ / dT < 0. There seems to be a metal-insulator transition between S = 0.50 and S = 0.08

To create an understanding of this let us focus on T = 0, where the magnetic configuration is simple (collinear). The [formula] spin electrons inhabit the [formula] core spin domains, and vice versa. The conductance arises from the inter-penetrating parallel channels for up and down spin electrons. One could call it "complementary percolation". Let us identify up electrons with the 'majority' phase, and down with the 'minority' domains. The net conductivity σtot(S)  =  σmaj(S)  +  σmin(S). While this reduces monotonically with reducing S in our data, Fig.2.(b), the conductivity also depends on pcorr. Even at S = 0, one could increase σtot systematically by increasing pcorr, i.e, reducing the fragmentation of the conduction paths. Weak localisation effects, etc, in two dimensions could show up at much longer lengthscales, but at a given cutoff size the trend above would survive.

Temperature dependence:

The ASD configuration is T independent so the primary sources of T dependence on transport are (i) the weakening of AF locking across the domain boundaries, and (ii) fluctuations about the FM state within a domain. The first effect enhances the conductivity, while the second serves as a source of scattering. Their relative importance depends on σ(T = 0). For weak disorder (large S) one is far from the percolation threshold and the decrease in σ due to intra-domain magnetic scattering is larger than the enhancement from inter-domain tunneling. However, by the time S = 0.50 there is already a weak upturn in ρ as T  →  0, the intra-domain effect is visible, and this becomes the dominant effect as S  →  0.

An analysis of the spatial spin-spin correlations illustrates the AF locking of domains at low temperature and how this weakens with increasing T. The first column in Fig.3 reproduces one set of ASD configurations from Fig.1 (the first column). The next three columns show the the magnetic overlap [formula], where [formula] is the lower left corner spin in each configuration, for MC snapshots at T / t = 0.03, ~ 0.05, ~ 0.07. These pictures would correspond to 'magnetic domains' if the patterns survived thermal averaging. The low temperature snapshots correspond closely to the ASD pattern. The antiphase boundary (APB) and the magnetic domain wall (MDW) pattern coincide at T / t  =  0.03. At T / t = 0.05, however, close to the bulk Tc, there is no correlation between the APB and the gi pattern. There is significant core spin overlap across the boundary, and large fluctuation, overall, in spin orientation. This bears out the transport mechanism we suggested in the preceding paragraph.

Field dependence

The field dependence of magnetisation and resistivity is shown in Fig.4., at relatively low temperature, T / t = 0.03, in (a)-(b), and high temperature, T / t = 0.07, in (c)-(d). Three energies play out when h  ≠  0: (i) the bulk Zeeman cost of the 'minority' domains, ~  hVmin, where Vmin is the volume of the minority phase, (ii) the interfacial AF energy, ~  JAFV(1  -  pcorr), where 1  -  pcorr is the fraction of AF bonds on the lattice, and (iii) the gain in electronic kinetic energy on removal (or rotation) of MDW's. (i) and (iii) prefer domain alignment while (ii) prefers to retain domain walls. In a 'spin only' model (iii) would be absent. This delocalisation energy gain serves to reduce the field at which domain rotation can occur.

At low T, Fig.4.(a)-(b), the ordered samples have a high degree of magnetic order, so the field induced increase in M, and the decrease Δρ  /  ρ(0), where ρ(0)  =  ρ(h = 0) and Δρ  =  ρ(0) - ρ(h), is quite small. The low T low field response is, however, dramatic for low S samples. These samples have M(h = 0)  ~  0, and a large ρ(0) due to the fragmented (spin selective) conduction path. A field as small as h / t  ~  0.001 leads to M2  ~  0.1, so M  ~  0.3. The corresponding impact on spin correlations is shown in the lowest row in Fig.5, where the MDW pattern is strongly affected by h. While the domain rotation effect is visible both for S = 0.50 and S = 0.08, the less disordered sample had a larger conductivity at h = 0 so the fractional change is much larger for S = 0.08.

At high temperature, Fig.4.(c)-(d), the domains cease to exist and conductance gain from domain rotation is irrelevant. In the large S samples there are few AF links so the applied field just suppresses the magnetic fluctuations leading to large Δρ  /  ρ(0). In the most disordered samples there are (1 - pcorr) / 2  ~  7% of AF bonds. Although there are no domains, these act as a source of scattering. The gain in conductivity is slower in the disordered samples compared to the more ordered ones.

Half metallicity

These systems are unusual because at T = 0 within each domain the conduction electron has only one spin polarisation but averaged over the system both [formula] and [formula] electrons have density of states at εF. A local probe, with probe area <  ξ2, will allow only spin polarised tunneling, while a probe averaging over domains will see both [formula] and [formula]. Fig.6 shows [formula] as a measure of half-metallicity. It is unity only in the absence of ASD and at T = 0, and in general has a behaviour that broadly mimics the behaviour of the core spin magnetisation, Fig.2.(a).

Discussion

There are two issues we want to touch upon, to relate our work to real double perovskites. (a). The role of dimensionality: it is well known that localisation effects are stronger in 2D compared to 3D, so we ran this entire calculation on a 123 system to check out the trends in transport. In particular we confirmed that there indeed is a sharp rise in the residual resistivity (although possibly no insulating phase) with increasing ASD. The low temperature upturn in ρ(T) is present, but weaker, even in 3D. (b). Role of grain boundaries: in the absence of a chemical characterisation of the grain boundary material, and an electronic model for the GB, it is hard to construct a comprehensive theory. However, since grain size, lG >  > ξ, it should be possible to study the role of APB's and MDW's via non contact probes that focus on a single grain.

Conclusion

We have studied a double perovskite model on antisite disordered backgrounds with a high degree of short range correlation. In this situation, the antiphase boundaries coincide with the T = 0 magnetic domain walls. Growing ASD reduces the low field magnetization, destroys the half-metallicity, and leads to a low temperature metal-insulator transition. While these are disadvantages, we also note that the ferromagnetic Tc is only weakly affected by moderate ASD and the low field magnetoresistance is dramatically enhanced by disorder. Our real space results allow an interpretation of these in terms of the domain pattern, the effective exchange, and the short range magnetic correlations. They are also consistent with explicit spatial imagery from recent experiments. The 'intra-grain' effects highlighted here would be directly relevant to single crystals, and define the starting point for a transport theory of the polycrystalline double perovskites.
