Searching for Weak or Complex Magnetic Fields in Polarized Spectra of Rigel

Introduction: Physical Parameters and Observations

Rigel: a blue supergiant, the closest and most readily studied Type II supernova progenitor, and a known α Cygni variable, is the subject of a global monitoring campaign known as the 'Rigel-thon', involving long-term spectroscopic monitoring, Microvariability and Oscillations in STars (MOST) space photometry, and spectropolarimetry.

Like most OB stars, β Ori A shows no sign of an easily detected magnetic field, however apparent brightness and sharp spectral lines make it practical to ask if the star possesses a weak or complex field geometry which might be revealed within a high resolution data set. Thus, over the epoch 09/2009-02/2010, 65 Stokes V (circular polarization) and 13 Stokes Q and U (linear polarization) spectra spanning 370-1000 nm with a mean resolving power R ~   65000 at 500 nm, were taken with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT and its clone Narval at TBL. Integration times were typically of a few seconds duration. The densest spectropolarimetric sampling was concurrent with the collection of MOST data.

The physical radius was determined from the interferometric angular diameter, θD = 2.76 ±   0.01 mas ([\cite=Aufdenberg_2008]) together with a distance of 240 ±   50 pc calculated using the Hipparcos parallax of 4.22 ±   0.81 mas: thus R = 70 ±   14 R[formula]. The star appears to be a slow rotator, with vsini = 36 ±   5 km/s ([\cite=Przybilla_2009]), giving an upper bound on the rotation period Prot of ~   98 d; calculation of the breakup velocity (~   250 km/s) provides a lower limit of ~   14 d.

Results and Analysis

Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) was employed to extract high S/N ratio mean Stokes I, V, and diagnostic N profiles from the circular polarization spectra. The LSD line mask was cleaned to eliminate contamination from telluric, emission and Balmer lines, and to remove weak or apparently absent lines. Ultimately ~   90 lines remained, and their weights were empirically adjusted to reflect observed line depths. The typical S/N ratio in Stokes V mean profiles was ~   20,000. No significant signal was detected in either Stokes V or diagnostic N.

Each LSD profile was then analyzed to determine the longitudinal magnetic field Bl. No significant longitudinal field was detected, with a median 1-σ uncertainty in individual measurements of 13 G. The distribution of Bl values inferred from Stokes V is statistically identical to that inferred from diagnostic N. The measured Bl was then compared to a grid of synthetic longitudinal field curves corresponding to dipoles with 0[formula] ≤  β  ≤   90[formula], 0[formula] ≤  i  ≤   90[formula] (with the data folded according to the theoretical maximum Prot = 93 d at i = 90[formula] and progressively shorter periods at smalled i, with ten different phase offsets tested at each period), and polar field strengths Bd from 0 to ~   3 kG. For (i = 90[formula], β = 90[formula]) the maximum Bd compatible with the data at 3-σ confidence is ~   20 G, while Bd is constrained below ~   50 G for intermediate values of i and β. Fields at this level, if present within the photosphere, remain capable of strongly influencing the wind ([\cite=udDoula_Owocki_2002]), with a wind magnetic confinement parameter η*  ~   2 - 90, assuming [formula] ~   10- 7-10- 6 M[formula]/y ([\cite=Barlow_Cohen_1977], [\cite=Abbot_1980], [\cite=Puls_2008]) and v∞  ~   400-600 km/s ([\cite=Bates_1980]).

Rigel is a long-known α Cygni variable ([\cite=Sanford_1947]), with significant line profile variability (LPV) in Hα as well as various metal lines, which may be associated with any or all of: mass loss events, photospheric spots, corotating interacting structures, and/or g- or p-mode pulsations ([\cite=Kaufer_1996a], [\cite=Kaufer_1997]). Distinct LPV is seen in Hα as compared to metal lines: Hα is in strong emission, variable over a broad velocity range and apparently aperiodic (consistent with earlier spectroscopic monitoring ([\cite=Kaufer_1996a], [\cite=Kaufer_1996b], [\cite=Israelian_1997])); metal lines showed little apparent emission excess, but their variability was suggestive of periodic behaviour. Amongst the most complexly variable of the metal lines is the O triplet at 777 nm.

Conclusions & Future Work

No evidence of a magnetic field is obtained in 65 high precision Stokes V observations of Rigel. Significant variability is observed in numerous spectral lines, with some suggestion of periodicity on the order of ~   1 month in metallic lines. Further modeling of Stokes V profiles must be performed to obtain quantitative constraints on various potential field topologies, e.g. the dynamo-generated field proposed by Cantiello ([\cite=Cantiello_2009]); a more rigorous analysis of LPV may help to identify periodic behaviour.
