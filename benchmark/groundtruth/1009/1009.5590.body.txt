Magnification as a Tool in Weak Lensing

Introduction. Weak gravitational lensing [\cite=Bartelmann:1999yn] [\cite=Schneider:2005ka] [\cite=Munshi:2006fn] has the potential to probe some of the most outstanding problems in cosmology. Hidden in the pattern of the ellipticities of background galaxies is information about the cosmic shear field, which in turn depends on the large scale properties of the universe, including the nature of the dark energy [\cite=Caldwell:2009ix] [\cite=Frieman:2008sn]. Among the systematic hurdles that must be overcome in order to mine this information is bias in the measurements of these ellipticities. Here we focus on multiplicative bias [\cite=Huterer:2005ez] [\cite=Heymans:2005rv] [\cite=Massey:2006ha] [\cite=Amara:2007as], the fact that the observed ellipticity of a galaxy is related to its true ellipticity via a multiplicative factor that is not necessarily equal to one. When ellipticities are converted to convergences (where κ is the convergence along the line of sight to the background galaxies), this translates to

[formula]

where the assumption that the multiplicative bias bm depends only on the redshift of the background probes follows the arguments of Refs. [\cite=Huterer:2005ez] [\cite=Heymans:2005rv] [\cite=Massey:2006ha] [\cite=Amara:2007as] that the angular dependence leads only to smaller, higher-order corrections.

Here we propose a method of calibrating the multiplicative bias, exploiting the effect that weak lensing has on the sizes and fluxes of the background galaxies. While shapes are usually used to infer κ, sizes and fluxes are also distorted. As such, these observables carry information about the convergence field and can also be used to improve cluster mass estimates [\cite=Rozo_Schmidt:unpub]. We show here that future surveys may be able to use this information to calibrate the multiplicative bias, thereby enabling us to capture more of the information contained in the cosmic shear field. For concreteness we focus mainly on two upcoming lensing surveys: the Dark Energy Survey [\cite=Abbott:2005bi] (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope [\cite=Ivezic:2008fe] (LSST), both at a single redshift slice (so that bm is constant).

The Impact of Lensing on Sizes and Fluxes. Weak lensing increases the size of a given galaxy by a factor of 1 + κ and the flux by 1 + 2κ, corresponding to a decrease in magnitude by 2.5 ln (1 + 2κ) /  ln (10). The average size and flux of galaxies in a survey, however, are affected by lensing in a more complex way due to the thresholds for inclusion in the survey. Consider Fig. [\ref=fig:distributions+lensing], which depicts the size and i-magnitude distributions of galaxies observed in the Hubble-GOODS survey [\cite=:2003ig] as they might appear in DES behind a region with κ = 0.1. Cuts in size and magnitude are depicted by the vertical lines and a mean seeing of 0.9'' has been added to the sizes. Although each individual galaxy increases in size/magnitude, the mean size/magnitude is also affected by the small/faint galaxies that are promoted into the survey by lensing. Thus, the change in the mean size/magnitude is not given by the simple relationships above.

We quantify the effect of lensing of the mean sizes and magnitudes by introducing coefficients gs,gm defined via

[formula]

Here m0 and s0 are the mean magnitude and size in the entire galaxy sample, and the index i labels an angular pixel in which there are many galaxies, all of which are affected by the same convergence κtruei. Since s0 and m0 are obtained by averaging over all galaxies in the survey (behind regions with both positive and negative κ), they can be determined very accurately. The mean size and magnitude of background galaxies in a pixel, therefore, contain information about the cosmic shear field affecting that pixel.

To extract this information from sizes and magnitudes, we need to know the coefficients gm and gs. One hint comes from the recent detection of lensing on the average flux of SDSS quasars [\cite=Menard:2009yb]. They found a value of gm =  - 0.25 (- CS in their notation). Using the deep HST data, we can simulate DES/LSST conditions and estimate the coefficients. We take the unlensed sizes and magnitudes, adopt a value of κ, generate a new set of simulated data by m  →  m - 2.5 ln (1 + 2κ) /  ln 10 and s  →  s(1 + κ), and then apply simulated seeing and cuts of sobs > 1.2'' and mobs  <  24. The resulting means 〈mobs〉 and 〈sobs〉 then determine the g's via, e.g., gm  =  (〈mobs〉 - m0) / κ. We find gm =  - 0.3 and gs = 0.25, fairly independently of cuts and κ, so we use these values in the projections.

Estimating gm and gs from survey data is likely to be more difficult. The standard estimate for gm, e.g., is

[formula]

where N(m)dm is the number of galaxies in the magnitude interval m-m + dm and mc is the magnitude cut. This formula though neglects the real world complexities introduced by multiple cuts (size and magnitude) and the finite statistics in the magnitude bin used to estimate N(m). Instead, we may need to use data from even deeper surveys to calibrate the g's for the survey of interest, just as have used used HST data here to estimate the g's for DES.

Reducing Multiplicative Bias. We now envision using all three sets of observables (ellipiticites, sizes, and magnitudes), each of which depends on κtrue, to constrain the multiplicative bias, and therefore reduce the errors on cosmological parameters. As an illustration, we consider the case where there is only a single cosmological parameter, the amplitude of the power spectrum of the convergence, Pκ. If we had no information about the bias bm, then ellipticity measurements alone could not determine the amplitude of the power spectrum, Pκ. Technically, if the amplitude of the power spectrum were characterized by a, with a = 1 being the true value, there would be a complete degeneracy between a and bm, since

[formula]

where θij is the angular distance between the two pixels, Pκ is the (assumed known) shape of the power spectrum (Pκ = aPκ), and σκ is the rms of the ellipticities in the absence of a signal, due to shape noise and measurement errors. Observations of ellipticities then depend only on the product abm, so there is a complete degeneracy between these two parameters.

The sizes and magnitudes contain information that break this degeneracy. A simple way to exploit this information is to consider the full set of two-point functions of (convergence, size, and magnitude) for each pair of pixels:

[formula]

The variances σ2s and σ2m include contributions from intrinsic scatter in sizes and magnitudes and also the measurement errors expected in the survey. Here, we have assumed that the intrinsic sizes and fluxes of galaxies are uncorrelated with one another.

The data set will then contain 3N numbers: the average size, magnitude, and shear/convergence of all galaxies in a set of N pixels. To assess how powerful this information will be, we construct the Fisher matrix. The [formula] Fisher matrix is

[formula]

where α,β run over the two parameters a and bm, the trace is over all the 3N observables and C is their 3N  ×  3N covariance matrix with elements given in Eqs. ([\ref=eq:kk]-[\ref=eq:mm]).

DES (LSST) will cover about 5,000  (20,000) sq. degrees, and we consider pixels of size Δθ2 = 10 square arcmin. The total number of pixels is then [formula]. We focus only on the redshift range z∈[0.9,1.1] with an expected number of galaxies per pixel of M = 15  (100). The parameters assumed for magnitudes and sizes are summarized in Tab. [\ref=table0].

Fig. [\ref=fig:Ellipse] shows the projected constraints from DES assuming that all the pixels are uncorrelated (so the Fisher matrix is simply the one-pixel Fisher matrix times [formula]). The figure shows that multiplicative bias in a single redshift bin can be pinned down at the 5% level with the aid of size and magnitude measurements. Also shown is the projection for LSST. Here the requirements on the bias will be more severe because the statistical power is much higher [\cite=Amara:2007as], and indeed the extra information does pin down multiplicative bias at the percent level.

The projected errors in Fig. [\ref=fig:Ellipse] retain the degeneracy between a and bm that afflicts the shear-only measurements. This is an indication that the shear measurements carry the most statistical weight. To confirm this, consider the signal to noise of the shear measurement. Taking the ratio of the two terms on the right in Eq. ([\ref=eq:kk]) and weighting by the number of galaxies M in a pixel leads to [formula]. For DES (LSST) this is of order 0.1 (0.3). By contrast, a similar estimate for the size measurement using Eq. ([\ref=eq:ss]) leads to [formula], or 0.04 (0.07) for DES (LSST). Although the dispersion in sizes is comparable to shape noise, the signal is suppressed by a factor of gs. A similar estimate for the magnitudes yields even smaller signals. So the shear measurements dominate the constraints, and the utility of the size/magnitude measurements is to break the degeneracy between the amplitude of the clustering (a) and the multiplicative bias (bm).

We have neglected correlations between pixels. When these are added in, the constraints will become tighter. We have not computed the Fisher matrix including all correlations, but we have studied how the constraints with and without correlations compare for smaller fields as the number of pixels increases . These studies suggest that there is additional information in the correlations which will further tighten the constraints on multiplicative bias by at least 10%.

Conclusions. Weak lensing affects several observed properties of galaxies: not only does it distort their shapes, but it also alters their observed sizes and magnitudes. We have demonstrated that these other distortions can turned into an asset: the lensing effect on the average galaxy size and magnitude helps to constrain multiplicative bias. The comprehensive way to determine how successful these new observables will be at improving cosmological constraints is to add them to the program initiated by Bernstein [\cite=Bernstein:2008aq], where the Fisher matrix for all parameters (cosmological and nuisance) is determined for a fixed set of measurements of κ and the density of sources. Here we have estimated the improvement in a simple setting where only the amplitude of the power spectrum is unknown. This simple example suggests that the added information is potentially useful and should be incorporated into the more comprehensive program and ultimately into the full analysis pipeline of upcoming surveys.
