THE UNIVERSE ANDTHE QUANTUM COMPUTER

Introduction

Both the universe and a measurement based quantum computer can be modeled as follows

[formula]

In this process, W is the initial state given by a density operator, U1 is a quantum gate (or propagator from time 0 to t1) given by a unitary operator, M1 is a quantum event given by a projection operator P1(A1), U2 is a quantum gate (or propagator from time t1 to t2) given by a unitary operator, M2 is a quantum event given by a projection operator P2(A2), [formula].

In the universe model, A1 is one of various possible configurations and P1(A1) is the quantum event that the universe is in configuration A1 at time t1. In the quantum computer model A1 is a set of possible outcomes for a measurement and P1(A1) is the quantum event that one of the outcomes in A1 occurs. In this model, the measurements can be adaptive in the sense that a choice of measurements may depend on the results of previous measurements. The universe model is referred to as the histories approach to quantum mechanics [\cite=dgt08] [\cite=djs10] [\cite=hal09] [\cite=ish94] [\cite=mocs05] [\cite=sor941] [\cite=sor942] [\cite=sor07]. A school of researchers believe that this approach is the most promising way to unify quantum mechanics and gravitation. The measurement based quantum computer model is equivalent to the quantum circuit computer model but various researchers believe it has superior properties both in theory and for practical implementation [\cite=bbdrv09] [\cite=gespg07] [\cite=joz09]. It has been suggested that the universe is itself a gigantic quantum computer. This paper shows that there may be relevance to this statement.

The mathematical background for these models consists of a fixed complex Hilbert space H on which the operators W, Ui Pi(Aj) act. In accordance with quantum principles, we assume that Pi is a projection-valued measure, [formula]. In the universe model, H is infinite dimensional, t is continuous and the sets Ai can be infinite. At the present time, this theory is not complete and is not mathematically rigorous [\cite=djs10] [\cite=ish94] [\cite=sor942]. Nevertheless, a quantum measure and integration theory has been developed to treat this approach [\cite=gudms] [\cite=gud09] [\cite=sor941] [\cite=sor942] [\cite=sor07]. In this article we show that the quantum integral defined in [\cite=gud09] is the unique functional that satisfies certain basic physical and mathematical principles.

Since the universe is too vast and complicated for us to tackle in detail now, we move on to the study of quantum computers. From another viewpoint, we are treating toy universes that are described by finite dimensional Hilbert spaces and finite sets. This experience may give us the power and confidence to tackle the real universe later. In this work we make some observations that may be useful in developing the structure for a general theory. For example, we show that the sum of the quantum measure of the paths is unity and that the total interference vanishes. Thus, constructive interference is always balanced by an equal amount of destructive interference. We hope that this article encourages an interchange of ideas between the two groups working on measurement based quantum computation and the histories approach to quantum gravity. It is fascinating to contemplate that the very large and the very small may be two aspects of the same mathematical structure.

Quantum Measures and Integrals

One of the main studies of the universe is the field of quantum gravity and cosmology. In this field an important role is played by the histories approach to quantum mechanics [\cite=dgt08] [\cite=djs10] [\cite=hal09] [\cite=ish94] [\cite=sor07]. Let Ω be the set of paths (or histories or trajectories) for a physical system. We assume that there is a natural σ-algebra A of subsets of Ω corresponding to the physical events of the system and that [formula] for all ω∈Ω. In this way, (Ω,A) becomes a measurable space. A crucial tool in this theory is a decoherence functional [formula] where D(A,B) roughly represents the interference amplitude between events A and B. Examples of decoherence functionals for the finite case are given in Section 3. In the infinite case, the form of the decoherence functional is not completely clear [\cite=djs10]. However, it is still assumed that D exists and that future research will bear this out. It is postulated that D satisfies the following conditions.

If D is the decoherence functional, then μ(A) = D(A,A) is interpreted as the "propensity" that the event A occurs. We refrain from calling μ(A) the probability of A because μ does not have the usual additivity and monotonicity properties of a probability. For example, if [formula], then Thus, the interference term [formula] prevents the additivity of μ. Even though μ is not additive in the usual sense, it does satisfy the more general grade-2 additivity condition

[formula]

for any mutually disjoint A,B,C∈A. Moreover, by Condition (5), μ satisfies the following continuity conditions.

[formula]

A grade-2 additive map [formula] satisfying [\eqref=eq22] and [\eqref=eq23] is called a q-measure [\cite=gudms] [\cite=gud09] [\cite=sor941]. A q-measure of the form μ(A) = D(A,A) also satisfies the following regularity conditions.

[formula]

A q-measure space is a triple (Ω,A,μ) where Ω,A) is a measurable space and [formula] is a q-measure [\cite=gudms] [\cite=gud09].

For a q-measure space (Ω,A,μ) if A,B∈A we define the (A,B) interference term IμA,B by Of course, μ is a measure if and only if IμA,B = 0 for all A,B∈A and IμA,B describes the amount that μ deviates from being a measure on A and B. Since any q-measure μ satisfies [formula], if [formula] then

[formula]

Let (Ω,A,μ) be a q-measure space with Ai∈A mutually disjoint, [formula]. We then have

[formula]

Applying Theorem 2.2(b) [\cite=gudms] and [\eqref=eq26] we have

[formula]

Equation [\eqref=eq28] follows from [\eqref=eq27]

Let (Ω,A,μ) be a q-measure space and let [formula] be a measurable function. We define the quantum integral of f to be

[formula]

where dλ is Lebesgue measure on [formula] [\cite=gud09]. If [formula] is measurable, we can write f in a canonical way as f = f+ - f- where f+  ≥  0, f-  ≥  0 are measurable and f+f- = 0. We then define the quantum integral

[formula]

as long as the two terms in [\eqref=eq25] are not both ∞  . If μ is an ordinary measure (that is, μ is additive), then [formula] is the usual Legesgue integral [\cite=gud09]. The quantum integral need not be linear or monotone. That is, [formula] and [formula] whenever f  ≤  g, in general. However, the quantum integral is homogeneous in the sense that [formula], for all [formula]. If [formula] we say that f is integrable and we denote by L1(Ω,μ) the set of integrable functions.

If μ is a measure on A, then it is well known that the Lebesgue integral [formula] from L1(Ω,μ) to [formula] is the unique linear functional satisfying [formula] for all A∈A where χA is the characteristic function of A and if fi,f∈L1(Ω,μ) with [formula], lim fi = f, then [formula].

We now show that the quantum integral is also the unique functional satisfying certain basic principles.

If (Ω,A,μ) is a q-measure space, then [formula] is the unique functional [formula] satisfying the following conditions.

(i) If 0  ≤  α  ≤  β, γ  ≥  0 and [formula], then for some function [formula].

(ii) If f,g,h∈L1(Ω,μ) are nonnegative and have mutually disjoint support, then (iii) If fi,f∈L1(Ω,μ) with [formula], lim fi = f, then lim F(fi) = F(f). (iv) F(f) = F(f+) - F(f-).

Before we present the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm22], let us interpret the four conditions. Letting α = 1, [formula] in (i) we obtain F(χA) = μ(A) which shows that F is an extension of μ. Letting γ = 0 in (i) we obtain

[formula]

which is an extension of [\eqref=eq26] for μ. This also shows that F is linear for the simple function αχA  +  βχB except for an interference term. With γ  ≠  0, we can write (i) as which essentially states that γχB does not interfere with αχA  +  βχB. Condition (ii) is grade-2 additivity for F which is natural to expect for a functional extension of μ. Condition (iii) is a generalization of the continuity property [\eqref=eq22]. Finally, Condition (iv) is the natural way to extend F from nonnegative functions to arbitrary real-valued functions in L1(Ω,μ).

(of Theorem [\ref=thm22]). It is shown in [\cite=gud09] that [formula] satisfies (i)-(iv) where (iii) is called the q-dominated monotone convergence theorem. Conversely, suppose F satisfies (i)-(iv). Applying [\eqref=eq211] with [formula] we have that F(αχA) = αμ(A) for all A∈A. If IμA,B = 0 for all A,B∈A, then μ is a measure and both F(f) and [formula] are the Lebesgue integral of f. If IμA,B  ≠  0 for A,B∈A with [formula] we have by [\eqref=eq211] and (i) that

[formula]

Hence, u(α,β  +  γ) = u(α,β) and it follows that u(α,β) does not depend on β. Letting v(α) = u(α,β) for all 0  ≤  α  ≤  β we have that If IμA,B  ≠  0, then letting α  =  β we obtain for [formula] that

[formula]

Hence, v(α) = α for every α  ≥  0. We conclude that

[formula]

It follows from (ii) and induction that if [formula] have mutually disjoint support, then

[formula]

If [formula] and Ai∈A are mutually disjoint, it follows from [\eqref=eq212], [\eqref=eq213] that

[formula]

It is shown in [\cite=gudms] that

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq28] and similar expressions for the other terms, we conclude that Hence, [formula] for every nonnegative simple function. It follows from (iii) and the q-dominated monotone convergence theorem that [formula] for every nonnegative f∈L1(Ω,μ). By (iv), [formula] for every f∈L1(Ω,μ).

Quantum Computers

This section considers measurement based quantum computers [\cite=bbdrv09] [\cite=gespg07] [\cite=joz09]. The theory is simpler than that in Section 2 because the Hilbert space H is finite dimensional and the sample space Ω is finite. As discussed in Section 1, we have n measurements given by projection-valued measures [formula]. Let Oi be the set of possible outcomes for measurements Pi, [formula]. Then Oi is a finite set with cardinality [formula], [formula], where mi  ≤   dim H. Using the notation [formula], since Pi is a projection-valued measure, we have that

[formula]

[formula], where I is the identity operator. Also, if A,B  ⊆  Oi with [formula] it follows that Pi(A)Pi(B) = 0. For Ai  ⊆  Oi, [formula], we call [formula] a homogeneous event (or course-grained history) and for ai∈Oi we call a path (or trajectory or fine-grained history). Let Ω be the set of all paths and A = 2Ω the set of events. Then [formula] and [formula].

In accordance with Section 1, we have an initial state W given by a density operator on H and unitary operators Ui on H describing quantum gates, [formula]. For two paths [formula] and [formula], the decoherence functional D(ω,ω') is defined by

[formula]

Notice that D(ω,ω') = 0 if an  ≠  bn; that is, the paths don't end at the same point. For A,B∈A, we extend the decoherence functional by bilinearity to get [\cite=djs10] Then D satisfies the usual properties (1)-(5) (Section 2) of a decoherence functional. It follows that μ(A) = D(A,A) is a q-measure on A. If [formula] is a pure state, we have

[formula]

As in Section 2, we define the (ω,ω') interference term by We then have that

[formula]

Although the next result is well known, we include the proof because it is particularly simple in this case.

The q-measure μ satisfies the regularity conditions [\eqref=eq24], [\eqref=eq25].

To prove [\eqref=eq24], suppose that μ(A) = 0 and [formula]. Applying Condition (4) of Section 2 we conclude that D(A,B) = 0. Hence,

[formula]

To prove [\eqref=eq25] suppose that [formula] and [formula]. Again, applying Condition (4) we have that

[formula]

Hence, [formula] so that μ(A) = μ(B).

Although the next result is elementary, it does not seem to be well known. This result shows that the sum of the quantum measure of the paths is unity and that the total interference vanishes. This indicates that at least one of the outcomes ω∈Ω occurs and that constructive interference is always balanced by an equal amount of destructive interference.

For the q-measure space (Ω,A,μ) we have

We prove this result for a pure state [formula] and the general result follows because any state is a convex combination of pure states. Applying [\eqref=eq33] we have

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq31] we have that

[formula]

Applying [\eqref=eq32] we have that Hence, by [\eqref=eq34] and what we just proved we obtain and the result follows.

The next theorem is a straightforward application of [\eqref=eq32]

(a) If [formula] is a pure state and [formula] is a homogeneous event, then (b) If Bi∈A are mutually disjoint, then

The result of Theorem [\ref=thm33](b) is consistent with the fact that the last measurement does not affect previous ones. We now make two observations. Since we have the inequalities

[formula]

Finally, it is not hard to show that the quantum integral becomes

[formula]

We close with an example of a simplified two-slit experiment. Suppose we have two measurements P1,P2 that have two values a1,a2 and b1,b2, respectively. We can assume that dim H = 2. We interpret a1,a2 as two slits and b1,b2 as two detectors on a detection screen. Suppose we have an initial pure state [formula]. Letting ψ = U1ψ0 and U = U2 for a homogeneous history A1  ×  A2 by Theorem [\ref=thm33](a) we have that

[formula]

We have the four paths (ai,bj), i,j = 1,2 and [\eqref=eq37] gives We see directly or by Theorem [\ref=thm32] that so at least one of the paths occurs.

The "probability" that detector b1 registers is and similarly Since one of the detectors registers. Letting ω = (a1,b1),ω' = (a2,b1), the (ω,ω') interference term becomes In general Iμω,ω'  ≠  0 and hence, [formula]. Thus, the two paths ω,ω' ending at detector b1 interfere. Similarly, the two paths ending at detector b2 interfere.

The "probability" that the particle goes through slit a1 is and the "probability" that the particle goes through slit a2 is Since [formula], the particle goes through one of the slits. Again, so the detectors do not interfere with the slits.

Now [formula] and μ(Ω) = 1 so we have μ(A) for the ten homogeneous events out of the [formula] events in A. We have two remaining doubleton sets [formula], [formula] where ω1 = (a1,b1), ω2 = (a2,b2), ω3 = (a1,b2), ω4 = (a2,b1). It follows from [\eqref=eq32] that in general, any two paths that end at different locations do not interfere. Hence, and similarly Finally, we have the four 3-element sets. Applying [\eqref=eq34] gives

[formula]

In a similar way,

[formula]

To illustrate this example more concretely, we employ the binary notation that is used in the quantum computation literature. We denote the four paths by 00,01,10,11 and the computational basis for [formula] by [formula] and [formula]. The measurements P1 = P2 are relative to the computational basis and are given by [formula], [formula]. Suppose U is the Hadamard matrix If the initial state is [formula], we have

[formula]

Since Iμω,ω' = 0 for all ω,ω' there are no interferences. Hence, μ is a classical measure generated by the previous four measure values.

Next, suppose the initial state is the uniform superposition Then and similarly, μ(01) = μ(10) = μ(11) = 1 / 4. The interference terms become

[formula]

The measures of the doubleton events become

[formula]

and the measures of the tripleton events become

[formula]

Finally, we illustrate the computation of two quantum integrals for the situation in the last paragraph. Let f be the function that gives the "length" of a path where f(00) = f(11) = 1, [formula]. We then have which is the classical result. To get a nonclassical integral define the function g by g(00) = 0, g(01) = g(10) = 1, g(11) = 2. We then have
