Broken sigma-model isometries in very special geometry Bernard de Wit1 Theory Division, CERN CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland and Antoine Van Proeyen2 Instituut voor theoretische fysica Universiteit Leuven, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium

ABSTRACT

We show that the isometries of the manifold of scalars in N = 2 supergravity in d = 5 space-time dimensions can be broken by the supergravity interactions. The opposite conclusion holds for the dimensionally reduced d = 4 theories, where the isometries of the scalar manifold are always symmetries of the full theory. These spaces, which form a subclass of the special Kähler manifolds, are relevant for superstring compactifications. width 5.cm 1 On leave of absence from the Institute for Theoretical Physics, Utrecht, The Netherlands 2 Onderzoeksleider, N.F.W.O.

We have grown accustomed to supersymmetry implying the existence of symmetries rather than breaking them. In this letter we approach this question from the other end and investigate what happens to the symmetries of certain non-linear sigma models when contained in N = 2 supergravity. We analyze two supergravity theories coupled to vector supermultiplets, both based on the real symmetric tensors dABC ([formula]). One is supergravity in five space-time dimensions [\cite=GuSiTo]; the other one is the same theory but reduced to four space-time dimensions [\cite=dWVP].

In four dimensions the supergravity theories based on the tensor dABC can lead to flat potentials [\cite=BEC]. Furthermore these theories appear as low-energy effective theories of certain superstring compactifications on (2,2) superconformal theories (containing the Calabi-Yau three-folds), where the dABC correspond to the Yukawa couplings and depend on the moduli of the superconformal theory [\cite=CecFerGir] [\cite=DixKapLou]. The corresponding non-linear sigma models (as well as the moduli space of the superconformal theories) exhibit special geometry [\cite=special].

In the five-dimensional case we show that the full isometry group of the corresponding non-linear sigma model is not necessarily preserved by the supergravity interactions. This will be done in the context of a specific class of sigma models, namely those corresponding to an SO(n - 1,1) / SO(n - 1) target space. We find that not all the SO(n - 1,1) isometries are symmetries of the full supergravity action. Here we should stress that most of the attention was focused on the latter symmetries [\cite=GuSiTo]; usually one simply assumes that those comprise all symmetries of the non-linear sigma model.

This above result is relevant for understanding the symmetry structure of the non-linear sigma model that emerges after dimensional reduction, which is governed by the symmetry of the full action before dimensional reduction, rather than by the symmetries of the scalar sector alone, as some of the scalar fields after dimensional reduction originate from tensor and vector fields. As was shown in [\cite=CecFerGir] dimensional reduction is a useful tool in understanding the relation between the low-energy theories corresponding to different strings compactified on the same superconformal theory. Its implications for the symmetry structure of the various geometries is discussed in more detail in [\cite=dWVPSwa].

After dimensional reduction one obtains a non-linear sigma model whose target space is a special Kähler space. Such spaces are characterized by holomorphic functions that are homogeneous of second degree. In the case at hand the relevant functions are

[formula]

Surprisingly enough, in four dimensions the situation is just the opposite: all isometries of the corresponding non-linear sigma model constitute symmetries of the full supergravity action. The proof of this result will be given in the second part of this letter. The symmetries take the form of the so-called duality invariances under which the equations of motion, but not necessarily the full action, are invariant. For the class of theories based on ([\ref=Fd4]) the generalized duality transformations were derived in [\cite=BEC].

We start by recalling some relevant features of the Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories in d = 5 space-time dimensions [\cite=GuSiTo]. These theories are based on n - 1 real scalar fields and n vector fields (one of them corresponding to the graviphoton). The part of the Lagrangian pertaining to these fields, reads

[formula]

where (d  h)AB  =  dABC  hC, (d  h  h)A  =  dabc  hBhC, etc.. In ([\ref=5dLagr]) AAμ and FAμν(A) denote the gauge fields and their corresponding Abelian field strengths while the scalar fields hA are subject to the condition

[formula]

The scalar fields must be restricted to a domain so that all kinetic terms in ([\ref=5dLagr]) have the required signature.

The Lagrangian ([\ref=5dLagr]) is manifestly invariant under linear transformations of the fields

[formula]

provided that the matrices [formula] leave the tensor dABC invariant

[formula]

However, the corresponding non-linear sigma model may possess extra invariances, which are not symmetries of the full action. The first topic of this letter is to establish that this phenomenon does indeed take place in the context of an explicit class of models. The corresponding five-dimensional supergravity theories were already discussed in [\cite=GSTkinks]. The scalar fields parametrize the coset space

[formula]

Assuming that the space remains symmetric in the reduction to four dimensions, the authors of [\cite=GSTkinks] incorrectly identified the target spaces of the corresponding d = 4 models with the hermitian symmetric spaces [formula]. We shall see, however, that some of the symmetries contained in SO(n - 1,1) are broken by the supergravity interactions, so that the full action ([\ref=5dLagr]) is not invariant under this group, and neither is the dimensionally reduced d = 4 action. It is therefore not surprising that the corresponding special Kähler manifolds are no longer symmetric, although they are still homogeneous. The homogeneity is a consequence of the fact that the solvable part of SO(n - 1,1) is still realized as a symmetry. These homogeneous spaces were discovered in [\cite=dWVP3], where they were denoted by L( - 1,n - 2). By further reduction to d = 3 dimensions they give rise to homogeneous quaternionic spaces, which are missing in the classification of [\cite=Aleks]. For a more detailed discussion of this, we refer to [\cite=dWVPSwa].

Let us now introduce the models. Splitting the range of the indices A into A = 1,2 and [formula], the non-zero d coefficients are

[formula]

The symmetries of the d tensor consist of SO(n - 2) rotations on hi and n - 1 transformations, which are related to n  ×  n matrices (2) and (i), defined by

[formula]

Already at this point one can see that something special should occur. Consider the case n = 3. The isometries associated with (2) and (3) generate a solvable group that acts transitively on the two-dimensional space. Hence the space is homogeneous. Spaces that allow a solvable transitive group of motions are called normal. They are isomorphic to the group space of this solvable group and the corresponding solvable algebra follows from the Iwasawa decomposition of the full isometry algebra (see, e.g. [\cite=Helg]). As the real space has only two dimensions, the (non-Abelian) solvable algebra can only be isomorphic to = t1. But this is just the solvable algebra corresponding to the symmetric space SO(2,1) / SO(2), which has a three-dimensional isometry group. This in contrast with the result found above (cf. ([\ref=Binv])), which indicates the existence of only two symmetries. Therefore we expect that the scalar manifold should exhibit an extra isometry, which is not a symmetry of ([\ref=5dLagr]). This is indeed confirmed by the following analysis.

Choose n - 1 independent coordinates φa  =  {φ2,φi}, such that ([\ref=dhhh1]) is satisfied,

[formula]

From ([\ref=5dLagr]) we obtain the metric

[formula]

which, in the parametrization above, takes the form

[formula]

One may now determine all invariances of gab∂μφa∂μφb. First there are SO(n - 2) rotations on φi, which constitute an obvious invariance. Furthermore one finds 2n - 3 additional symmetries, with parameters ai,  bi and c,

[formula]

When combined with SO(n - 2), these variations generate the group SO(n - 1,1). The transformations parametrized by c and ai correspond to (2) and (i), respectively. However, the transformations parametrized by bi are new and are not realized as symmetries of the Lagrangian ([\ref=5dLagr]).

This thus proves the first assertion of this paper according to which the isometries of the non-linear sigma model can be broken by supergravity interactions, at least in d = 5 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity.

We now come to the second topic and consider the d = 4 supergravity theory based on the functions ([\ref=Fd4]), where the tensor dABC is arbitrary. This theory can be obtained by dimensional reduction from ([\ref=5dLagr]). In this reduction we obtain complex scalars zA. Their imaginary part originates from the components of the gauge fields AAμ in the fifth dimension, while their real part corresponds to the n - 1 independent fields hA and the component g55 of the metric. These scalars define a special Kähler space, but of a very special form [\cite=BEC], namely based on ([\ref=Fd4]). An important property of these models is that, within the equivalence class of Kähler potentials K(z,)  ~  K(z,) + Λ(z) + Λ̄(), there are representatives of the potential that depend only on the imaginary part of zA, i.e. on xA defined by

[formula]

We will denote one such a representative by g

[formula]

Therefore the metric depends only on x, and is just the second derivative of g with respect to x. Using the notation where multiple x-derivatives of g are written as [formula], the Kähler metric gA coincides with gAB, without the need for distinguishing holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices,

[formula]

The domain for the variables is restricted by the requirement that the kinetic terms for the scalars and for the graviton have the appropriate signature. This implies that ([\ref=scalkin]) is negative definite and dxxx > 0.

The derivatives of g are homogeneous functions of x, so that

[formula]

This implies in particular that

[formula]

The curvature corresponding to ([\ref=scalkin]) is

[formula]

where CABC equals

[formula]

This tensor is only constant if we are dealing with a symmetric space. In that case, the curvature components [formula] are thus constant (in the special coordinates introduced above) as well as covariantly constant. The homogeneity properties imply that

[formula]

We determine all possible isometries of the metric ([\ref=scalkin]). Subsequently the result will be compared to the duality invariances of N = 2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity in four dimensions, found in [\cite=BEC]. For the purpose of the proof we first note the existence of a subgroup of isometries, generated by constant real translations with parameters bA and scale transformations with parameter β,

[formula]

which are present irrespective of the value of the coefficients dABC. These symmetries can be understood from the dimensional reduction and find their origin in the symmetries of the corresponding five-dimensional theory [\cite=dWVPSwa].

The Killing equations that we must solve are

[formula]

Before turning to these equations we shall motivate a special parametrization of the Killing vectors ξA that we will use below. First we may always consider the commutator of any isometry with the translations and the scale transformations ([\ref=rztrans]). As the result must again be an isometry corresponding to some Killing vector, we conclude that under a uniform scaling of the zA and A, or equivalently of the real coordinates xA and yA, every Killing vector can again be decomposed into the independent Killing vectors. A similar result holds with respect to the translations: the derivative of any Killing vector with respect to yA must again be decomposable into Killing vectors. As the number of independent Killing vectors is finite, the latter restricts us to polynomials in y of a certain degree p (and x-dependent coefficient functions) and/or to a finite set of exponential functions. However, the exponential functions in y are not viable in view of the requirement from the scale transformations. When expanding in y they require an infinite set of coefficient functions in x in order to ensure that scale transformations will not generate an infinite number of Killing vectors (stated differently, the Killing vectors should be decomposable into a finite set of homogeneous functions in x and y). However, taking multiple derivatives with respect to y then still leads to an infinite set of Killing vectors. On the basis of these arguments we conclude that the Killing vectors can be written as finite polynomials in the yA, multiplied by homogeneous coefficient functions of xA of a degree such that the full Killing vector is homogeneous in xA and yA. Hence we may write

[formula]

With this parametrization, we write down the Killing equations for the terms proportional to [formula]. The first Killing equation ([\ref=kil1]) implies

[formula]

where here and henceforth the derivatives act on functions of x only and ∂B will denote the derivative with respect to xB and not with respect to zB, as before. The second Killing equation ([\ref=kil2]) reads

[formula]

Decomposing the functions [formula] into real and imaginary parts, [formula] and [formula], respectively, the Killing equations correspond to three real equations,

[formula]

Let us first evaluate ([\ref=drie]) a little further. After multiplication with xB, [formula] is expressed in terms of [formula],

[formula]

Re-inserting this result back into ([\ref=drie]) gives

[formula]

By virtue of ([\ref=imag]) we can express ([\ref=een]) and ([\ref=twee]) exclusively in terms of the real parts by using ([\ref=imag]). The resulting equations can be written as

[formula]

Using ([\ref=vier]) we can, in the left-hand side of the last equation, bring gDA under the derivative and obtain

[formula]

At this stage we are thus left with the equations ([\ref=vier]), ([\ref=dReR]) and ([\ref=eqC]), while the imaginary parts follow simply from ([\ref=imag]).

Now we concentrate on the leading term in the expansion ([\ref=kansatz]). Choosing k = p in ([\ref=een]) and ([\ref=imag]) shows at once that [formula] is real and constant. Therefore the Killing vector is homogeneous of degree p, so that the functions [formula] are homogeneous of degree p - k. Hence it follows from ([\ref=dReR]) that

[formula]

Furthermore, multiplying ([\ref=eqC]) with xA  xB and using the homogeneity of the functions involved, one shows at once that

[formula]

On the other hand [formula] is homogeneous of zeroth degree (while [formula] itself is constant). As its second derivative must vanish according to ([\ref=eqC]), it follows that it must be equal to a constant symmetric tensor,

[formula]

According to ([\ref=Rrec]) and ([\ref=contr1]) only [formula] and [formula] can now be nonvanishing, with the former restricted by ([\ref=contr2]) and the latter given by

[formula]

We now proceed as follows. We analyze the equations ([\ref=contr1])-([\ref=Rpm2]), first for p > 2, where we find that there are no non-trivial solutions, and subsequently for p  ≤  2. Then we verify whether the solutions satisfy the conditions ([\ref=vier]), ([\ref=dReR]) and ([\ref=eqC]). For the maximal non-trivial value of k these conditions are already satisfied by virtue of the results obtained so far. For instance, ([\ref=vier]) with k = p - 1, follows from ([\ref=contr2]), as one can verify by taking its first- and second-order derivative. Hence we are left with ([\ref=vier]) for k = p - 3, ([\ref=dReR]) for k = p - 2 and k = p - 4, and ([\ref=eqC]) for k = p - 3. However, because it turns out that non-trivial solutions exist only for [formula], we will only have to verify the validity of ([\ref=dReR]) for p = 2 and k = 0.

For p > 2 we get from ([\ref=Rpm2]) that

[formula]

which must vanish by virtue of ([\ref=contr1]). Therefore we find that [formula] vanishes. For those values of p we are thus left with only [formula] satisfying [formula]. However, taking the derivative with respect to xA and contracting with xB1 then leads to

[formula]

so that also [formula] vanishes.

For [formula] we find just the real translations introduced in ([\ref=rztrans]) with RA = bA.

For [formula] ([\ref=contr2]) reads

[formula]

which, upon differentiation, leads to

[formula]

Then we obtain IA from ([\ref=imag]) so that

[formula]

The condition ([\ref=p1cond]) can be written as

[formula]

The solution can be decomposed into a particular solution [formula] and a solution of the homogenous equation for which the left-hand side is zero. The latter are the matrices that leave the tensor dABC invariant. Hence we can write [formula], with β real (the normalization is such that we reproduce the scale transformation in ([\ref=rztrans])), while [formula] should satisfy ([\ref=Binv]).

For [formula] the condition ([\ref=contr2]) reads

[formula]

and leads to

[formula]

If CA = 0 we can use the same argument as before (cf. ([\ref=R0ifC0])) to put the whole solution to zero. So we need only a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation. Therefore we note that ([\ref=hompropR]) implies the relation

[formula]

so that we obtain the following solution for the coefficients REAB,

[formula]

In addition we must require that the right-hand side is constant. Subsequently, from ([\ref=imag]) we obtain IAB, while ([\ref=Rpm2]) determines RA, such that

[formula]

One can verify that also ([\ref=dReR]) is satisfied for this solution, which completes the analysis.

We have therefore found the following isometries (we redefine [formula])

[formula]

where the parameters are real, [formula] satisfies ([\ref=Binv]), and [formula] should be constant. These are exactly the generalized duality transformations found in [\cite=BEC].

There is one point that needs further clarification. In [\cite=BEC] the condition on the parameters aA was given as

[formula]

where the tensor EGABCD is defined by

[formula]

and CABC was given in ([\ref=defCABC]). To see that ([\ref=ainv]) is equivalent to the condition given above, we note the relations

[formula]

They allow us to derive the following equivalence

[formula]

The second and third condition are equivalent by virtue of ([\ref=curvC]). The first condition implies the second one, as follows directly from ([\ref=relCCE]). Conversely, the second condition implies that aEEEABCDxD = 0, again because of ([\ref=relCCE]). As CABCaC is now constant, also aEEEABCD is constant. Since we know that this constant should vanish upon multiplication with xD, it should itself be zero. This completes the proof that all isometries of the special Kähler manifolds based on ([\ref=Fd4]) coincide with the generalized duality invariances of [\cite=BEC] and are invariances of the full supergravity theory.
