η-invariant and a problem of Bérard-Bergery on the existence of closed geodesics

Introduction

The η-invariant introduced by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer [\cite=APS], as well as its various ramifications, has played important roles in many prblems in geometry and topology. In this short paper, we use the η-invariant to compute the Eells-Kuiper invariant for the Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective plane. By combining with a known result of Bérard-Bergery, it shows that every Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective plane carries a Riemannian metric such that all geodesics passing through a certain point are simply closed and of the same length.

To be more precise, let p be a point in a closed manifold M. Let g be a Riemannian metric on M. The Riemannian structure (M,g) is called an SCp Riemannian structure if all geodesics issued from p are simply closed (periodic) geodesics with the same length. We refer to the classic book [\cite=Be] for a systematic acount of the SCp structures.

It is clear that there are SCp Riemannian structures on the compact symmetric spaces of rank one (briefed in [\cite=Be] as CROSS), namely the unit spheres, the real projective spaces, the complex projective spaces, the quaternionic projective spaces and the Cayley projective plane, endowed with the corresponding canonical metrics. Moreover, a fundamental result of Bott [\cite=Bo] states that any smooth manifold carrying an SCp structure should have the same integral cohomolgy ring as that of a CROSS. On the other hand, there are manifolds verifying the above cohomological condition but not diffeomorphic to any CROSS. For typical examples, we mention the (exotic) homotopy spheres and the Eells-Kuiper (exotic) quaternionic projective planes.

In 1975, Bérard-Bergery [\cite=BB] discovered an SCp structure on an exotic sphere of dimension 10. He then raised the natural question: is there any (exotic) Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective plane carrying an SCp structure? The same question was also posed explicitly by Besse in the classic book [\cite=Be]. Moreover, it is pointed out in [\cite=Be] that a positive answer to the above question would also give a positive nontrivial example to the following open question: whether a Blaschke manifold at a point would carry an SCp Riemannian structure?

The purpose of this article is to provide a positive answer to the above two questions concerning the Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective planes.

Before going on, we describe the Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective planes as follows, starting with the standard construction of Milnor [\cite=Mi1].

For any pair of integers (h,j), let ξh,j be the S3-bundle over S4 determined by the characteristic map fh,j:S3  →  SO(4) with fh,j(u)v = uhvuj for u∈S3, [formula], where we identify [formula] with the space of quaternions. It is shown in [\cite=Mi1] that when h + j = 1, the total space of the above sphere bundle is homeomorphic to the unit sphere S7. From now on, we denote by Mh this total space corresponding to (h,j) = (h,1 - h), and denote by Nh the associated disk bundle.

When h = 0 or 1, Mh is just the unit 7-sphere and the sphere bundle is just the Hopf fibration (corresponding to the left or right multiplications of the quaternions, respectively). On the other hand, M2 is the exotic sphere generating the group Θ(7) (the set of the orientation preserving diffeomorphism classes of 7-dimensional oriented homotopy spheres), which is isomorphic to the cyclic group [formula].

It is shown by Eells-Kuiper [\cite=EK2] that the homotopy sphere Mh is diffeomorphic to S7 if and only if the following congruence holds for h,

[formula]

From now on, we assume that h satisfies (1.1). Then there is a diffeomorphism σ:Mh  →  S7. Let Xh,σ denote the 8 dimensional closed smooth manifold constructed from Nh by attaching the unit disk D8 by the diffeomorphism σ:∂(Nh) = Mh  →  ∂(D8) = S7. This is what we call an Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective plane, first constructed in [\cite=EK1]. We remark that when h = 0 or 1, and σ  =  id, Xh,σ is just the standard quaternionic projective plane [formula]. We also mention a deep result due to Kramer and Stolz [\cite=KS1] which asserts that the diffeomorphism type of the resulting manifold Xh,σ does not depend on the choice of the diffeomorphism σ:Mh  →  S7.

Let τh be the canonical involution on Mh obtained by the fiberwise antipodal involution on S3. By [\cite=BB] and the above result of Kramer-Stolz, to prove that Xh,σ carries an SCp Riemannian structure, one only needs to show that there is a diffeomorphism σ':Mh  →  S7 such that τσ' = σ'τh, where τ is the standard antipodal involution of S7. Equivalently, one needs only to show that the quotient manifold Mh  /  τh is diffeomorphic to [formula]. This is the content of the following main result of this paper.

The involution τh on [formula] is equivalent to the standard antipodal involution on S7. In other words, Mh  /  τh is diffeomorphic to [formula].

Every Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective plane admits an SCp Riemannian structure.

Since there is infinitely many Eells-Kuiper quaternionic projective planes not diffeomorphic to each other, the above Corollary actually shows that there is an infinite family of pairwise non-diffeomorphic manifolds M with the cohomology ring of [formula] such that each M admits an SCp Riemannian structure.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we reduce the proof of Theorem 1.1 to a problem of computing the Eells-Kuiper μ invariant introduced in [\cite=EK2]. In Section 3, we recall the results of Donnelly [\cite=Do1] and Kreck-Stolz [\cite=KS2] (cf. [\cite=G]) which use η-invariants to express the μ-nvariant, and then carry out the required computation of the involved η invariant.

Theorem 1.1 and the Eells-Kuiper μ invariant

As was indicated in [\cite=BB], by results of Mayer [\cite=Ma], there could only be two possibilities for Mh  /  τh. That is, it is diffeomorphic either to [formula] or to the connected sum [formula], where 14M2 is the connected sum [formula] of 14 copies of M2.

On the other hand, Milnor [\cite=Mi2] showed that the Eells-Kuiper μ invariant of [formula] and [formula] takes different values. Thus, in order to prove Theorem 1.1, one need only to show that the μ invariant of Mh  /  τh is different from that of [formula].

For completeness, we recall the definition of the Eells-Kuiper μ invariant in our situation. Let M be a 7 dimensional closed oriented spin manifold such that the 4-th cohomology group [formula] vanishes. If M bounds a compact oriented spin manifold N, then the first Pontrjagin class [formula] is well-defined.

Following [\cite=EK2], we define [formula] by

[formula]

where p21(N) denotes the corresponding Pontrjagin number and Sign(N) is the Signature of N.

Now set M = Mh, N = Nh. Let [formula] be the generator. By [\cite=Mi1], one has

[formula]

where e(ξh,1 - h) and p1(ξh,1 - h) are the Euler class and the first Pontrjagin class of the sphere bundle ξh,1 - h respectively. Also by [\cite=Mi1], one has

[formula]

From (2.2) and (2.3), one deduces as in [\cite=Mi1] and [\cite=EK2] that

[formula]

which is an integer in view of the assumption (1.1).

Recall that by [\cite=Mi2], one has [formula] while [formula]. Thus, in order to prove Theorem 1.1, one need only to prove the following result.

[formula]

Theorem 2.1 will be proved in Section 3

A proof of Theorem 2.1

In this section, we compute μ(Mh  /  τh). The obvious difficulty is that one does not find easily an 8 dimensional spin manifold with boundary Mh  /  τh. Instead, we will make use of an intrinsic formula for the μ invariant, which is given by Donnelly [\cite=Do1] and Kreck-Stolz [\cite=KS2] (cf. the survey paper of Goette [\cite=G]).

Indeed, for any 7 dimensional closed oriented spin manifold M with [formula], let gTM be a Riemannian metric on TM. Let [formula] be the associated Levi-Civita connection. Let [formula] be the corresponding first Pontrjagin form (cf. [\cite=Z]). Then there is a 3-form [formula] on M such that

[formula]

Let DM (resp. BM) be the Dirac (resp. Signature) operator associated to gTM. Let η(DM), η(BM) be the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer η invariant of DM, BM (cf. [\cite=APS]). Let

[formula]

be the corresponding reduced η-invariant.

By [\cite=Do1] and [\cite=KS2] (cf. [\cite=G]), the μ invariant defined in (2.1) can be represented by

[formula]

Now consider the double covering Mh  →  Mh  /  τh. We fix a spin structure on Mh  /  τh and lift everything from Mh  /  τh to Mh. We get that

[formula]

where [formula] is the canonical projection. Here τh denotes the lifted actions on the corresponding vector bundles.

Indeed, recall that Mh is a fiber bundle over S4 with fiber S3. It is the boundary of the unit disk bundle Nh over S4, while τh is the canonical involution which maps on each fiber by mapping a point to its antipodal. This involution extends canonically to an involution on Nh which we still denote by τh. Clearly, the fixed point set of τh on Nh is S4, the image of the zero section of the disk bundle.

Let gTNh be a τh invariant Riemannian metric on TNh such that it restricts to gTMh on ∂Nh = Mh and is of product structure near Mh (the existence of such a metric is clear). Let [formula] be the associated Levi-Civita connection.

By dimensional reason we see that we are in the situation of even type in the sense of [\cite=AB]. Thus there exists a τh-equivariant spin structure on Nh, such that it induces a τh-equivariant spin structure on Mh, which equals the one lifted from the spin structure given on Mh  /  τh. In particular, τh lifts to an action on the associated spinor bundle [formula] associated to (TNh,gTNh), preserving the corresponding [formula]-grading. It induces an action on S(TMh) = S+(TNh)|Mh. Moreover, the lifted τh action commutes with the Dirac operator DNh:Γ(S(TNh))  →  Γ(S(TNh)), and thus also commutes with the induced Dirac operator DMh:Γ(S(TMh))  →  Γ(S(TMh)), which in turn determines a Dirac operator on Mh  /  τh on which one can apply (3.2) and (3.3).

Let DNh, +:Γ(S+(TNh))  →  Γ(S-(TNh)) be the natural restriction of DNh. By the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem [\cite=APS] and its equivariant extention by Donnelly [\cite=Do2], one finds

[formula]

where the mod [formula] term comes from the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type index indAPS(PhDNh, +), [formula] is the Hirzebruch Â-form associated to [formula] (cf. [\cite=Z]) and A1 is the canonical contribution on the fixed point set (which by the local index theory is the same as the usual fixed point set contribution appearing in the equivariant Atiyah-Singer index theorem for compact group actions on closed manifolds).

Similarly,

[formula]

where [formula] is the Hirzebruch L-form associated to [formula] (cf. [\cite=Z]), A2 is the canonical contribution on the fixed point set and Sign(Nh,τh) is the notation for the equivariant Signature with respect to τh.

By a direct computation, one has

[formula]

[formula]

From (2.4) and (3.3)-(3.6), we find that

[formula]

Now let Wh denote the normal bundle in Nh to the submanifold S4, the fixed point set of τh. It is clear that τh acts on Wh by multiplication by - 1.

By (2.2) and [\cite=LM], one finds

[formula]

Similarly, by [\cite=LM] and (2.2), one has

[formula]

On the other hand, since S4 is the fixed point set of τh, τh preserves [formula]. Thus one has

[formula]

From (3.7)-(3.10), one gets

[formula]

We now claim that under the condition (1.1), (2.5) follows from (3.11).

Indeed, under the assumption (1.1), one has [formula]. Thus we only need to do the case by case checking as follows, where by "[formula]" we mean that the congruence is [formula].

(i) For h = 56k, then [formula], while [formula];

(ii) For h = 56k + 1, then [formula], while [formula];

(iii) For h = 56k + 8, one has [formula], while [formula];

(iv) For h = 56k + 49, one has [formula], while [formula].

Combining (i)-(iv) with (3.11), we always have (2.5).

The proof of Theorem 2.1, as well as of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.1 is complete.
