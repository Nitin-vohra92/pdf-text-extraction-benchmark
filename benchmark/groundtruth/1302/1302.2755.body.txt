2010 MSC: 33E05, 30C62

Introduction

Throughout this paper we let [formula] for 0 < r < 1. The well-known complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind [\cite=Bo] [\cite=BF] are respectively defined by

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the sequel, we will use the symbols K and E for K(r) and E(r), respectively. The complete elliptic integrals play a very important role in the study of conformal invariants [\cite=AVV3], quasiconformal mappings [\cite=AVV1] [\cite=AVV2] [\cite=AVV3] [\cite=H] and Ramanujan's modular equations [\cite=AQVV]. Numerous sharp inequalities and elementary approximations for the complete elliptic integrals have been proved in [\cite=AQ] [\cite=AQVa] [\cite=AVV3] [\cite=BPR] [\cite=KN1] [\cite=KN2].

The special function m(r) is defined as

[formula]

This function is of importance in the research of distortion theory of quasiconformal mappings in the plane. Recently, various interesting inequalities of m(r) have been obtained by several authors, see [\cite=AQVa] [\cite=AVV1] [\cite=AVV2] [\cite=AVV3] [\cite=QVu].

The power mean is defined for x,y > 0 and real parameter λ by

[formula]

It is well known that Mλ(x,y) is continuous and increasing with respect to λ. Many interesting properties of power means are given in [\cite=Bu]. Power mean inequalities for some special functions can be found in [\cite=A] [\cite=AVV3] [\cite=R] [\cite=WZJ] [\cite=ZWC].

In this paper, we shall show a power mean inequality for the special function m(r). Our main result is the following theorem:

Let λ be a real number. The inequality

[formula]

holds for all x,y∈(0,1) if and only if [formula]. The reverse of ([\ref=ineq:pm4m]) holds for all x,y∈(0,1) if and only if λ  ≥  C > 0, where C is some constant. The sign of equality is valid in ([\ref=ineq:pm4m]) if and only if x = y.

Lemmas

In order to prove our main result we need some lemmas, which we present in this section. We establish some properties of certain functions, which are defined in terms of the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds, K and E, respectively.

Now we list some derivative formulas [\cite=AVV3]:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where 0 < r < 1. By the derivative of m(r), it is easy to see that m(r) is strictly decreasing from (0,1) onto (0,  ∞  ).

The following Lemma [\ref=lem:citedlem1] is from [\cite=AQVV] and [\cite=AVV3].

The function f1(r) = r'2K  /  E is decreasing from (0,1) onto (0,1).

The function f2(r) = (E - r'2K) / r2 is strictly increasing and convex from (0,1) onto (π / 4,1).

For each c∈[null] such that H obtains its maximum C at r0. Thus it is easy to conclude from ([\ref=eqn:funct-h]) that h is strictly decreasing on (0,1) if and only if λ  ≥  C.

Proof of the main result

We are now in a position to prove the main result.

We first prove the inequality ([\ref=ineq:pm4m]) for [formula]. We may assume that x  ≤  y. Define

[formula]

Let t = Mλ(x,y), then [formula]. If x < y, we have that t > x . By differentiation,

[formula]

which is positive if and only if λ < 0 by Lemma [\ref=lem:funct-h]. Hence F(x,y) is strictly increasing with respect to x and F(x,y)  ≤  F(y,y) = 0. We now obtain the inequality

[formula]

that is [formula] if and only if λ < 0, with the equality if and only if x = y.

Similarly, by the statement in Remark [\ref=rmk:const-C] one can see that the reverse of ([\ref=ineq:pm4m]) holds for all x,y∈(0,1) if and only if λ  ≥  C > 0, C is the same as Remark [\ref=rmk:const-C], with the equality if and only if x = y.

Now we prove the inequality ([\ref=ineq:pm4m]) for λ = 0. We may assume that x  ≤  y. Define

[formula]

Let [formula], then [formula]. If x < y, we have that t > x . By logarithmic differentiation, we have

[formula]

which is negative. Hence G(x,y) is strictly decreasing with respect to x and G(x,y)  ≥  G(y,y) = 1. We now obtain the inequality

[formula]

that is [formula], with the equality if and only if x = y. This completes the proof.

The following corollary is clear.

The function m(r) is concave on (0,1) with respect to power mean of order λ if and only if [formula], and convex on (0,1) with respect to power mean of order λ if and only if λ  ≥  C.
