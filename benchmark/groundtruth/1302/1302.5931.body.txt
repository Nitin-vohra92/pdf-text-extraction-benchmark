A failed filament eruption inside a coronal mass ejection in active region 11121

Introduction

Solar eruptions are explosive ejections of large amounts of plasma from the lower to the upper layers of the solar atmosphere and are some of the most interesting events occurring in the active Sun. Eruptions associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are known as "full eruption", while those that do not lead to a CME are termed as "failed eruptions". It is generally accepted that magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in the process. However, the exact mechanism that drives solar eruptions remains to be identified. The classic "tether cutting" eruption model is based on a single, highly sheared magnetic bipole. This model assumes that the reconnection, which occurs deep in the sheared core region below the filament, removes stabilising restraints (tethers) leading the flux rope to erupt [\citep=moore1] [\citep=sturr1] [\citep=moore2] [\citep=moore3]. Another eruption mechanism is that of the "magnetic breakout" model, originally proposed by [\cite=ant] and [\cite=ant1]. This requires a multipolar magnetic configuration with a central magnetic arcade which is the main restraining magnetic flux of the filament located underneath. The energy supply for the breakout eruption comes from the free magnetic energy of the filament, which can be efficiently stored in sheared and/or twisted non-potential magnetic configurations [\citep=pri1]. As the central arcade expands upward and reconnects with the outer antiparallel field overarching the whole region, it is removed and sidelobe loops of the quadrupole are created. The removal of the central loop arcade, the main constraint over the filament, leads to the explosive eruption of the filament. Both the tether cutting and breakout models describe the disruption in the balance of the upward-directed force of magnetic pressure and the downward-directed force of magnetic tension.

The MHD helical kink instability of a magnetic flux rope anchored in the photosphere is considered as an alternative triggering mechanism for solar eruptive phenomena. This instability is the process which transforms twist (a measure of the windings of field lines about the axis of the flux rope) into writhe (a measure of the winding of the flux rope axis itself), [\citep=rust1]. It occurs when the twist exceeds a certain critical value. The conservation of helicity in ideal MHD requires that the resulting writhe, which can have the form of inverse γ shape, should be the same sign as the transformed twist [\citep=hood1] [\citep=bat1] [\citep=ger1] [\citep=fan1] [\citep=tor1] [\citep=rust1] [\citep=sr1].

Several observational studies of filament eruptions presented in recent years appear to agree with the breakout initiation scenario [\citep=aul1] [\citep=ster2] [\citep=man1] [\citep=ji1] [\citep=gary1] [\citep=deng1] [\citep=poh1] [\citep=al1] [\citep=josh1] [\citep=shen1]. The observations also show that reconnection, breakout and tether cutting can often all be present in the eruption [\citep=ster1]. A combination of the magnetic breakout scenario and kink instability could be responsible for the eruption event presented by [\cite=wil1].

In this paper, we undertake an observational study of a "failed filament" eruption associated with an M5.4-class flare [\citep=schr] [\citep=woods]. We describe the morphology and dynamic of the loop arcades and filament before and after the eruption, and interpret our observations in terms of the magnetic breakout and kink instability models.

Instruments and data

The observations were obtained between 15:10 - 18:01 UT on November 6, 2010 with the Solar Dynamics Observatory [\citep=lem], the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere [\citep=jess1] imaging system mounted on the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), and the Improved Solar Observing Optical Network (ISOON) patrol telescope [\citep=neid1] [\citep=bala1]. SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images were taken in the 304, 171, 131, 91 Å bandpasses using a spatial sampling of 0.6''/pixel and a 12 s cadence, with the 1700 Å bandpass having a 24 s cadence. Due to SDO's onboard exposure-time compensation during flare activity, the AIA image sequences consisted of frames captured with differing exposure times (0.1-2.9 s). To compensate for this, each AIA frame was normalised to its respective exposure time, resulting in a time series where true changes in intensity could clearly be observed. The magnetic topology of the observed active region was studied with SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager [\citep=sch1] line-of-sight magnetograms.

ROSA carried out simultaneous Hα line core imaging over a [formula] field-of-view between 15:59-17:01 UT. A spatial sampling of 0.069''/pixel was used to match the telescope diffraction limit in the blue part of the spectrum to that of the CCD. In order to keep the field-of-view the same this resulted in the Hα to be slightly oversampled corresponding to a spatial resolution of [formula] (i.e. approximately 3 pixels). High-order adaptive optics were in operation throughout the observations and the imaging quality was further improved using the image reconstruction algorithms of [\cite=wog1]. The effective cadence after reconstruction was 5.28 s.

Full-disk Hα line centre images were also obtained using the ISOON patrol telescope with a cadence of 1 minute and a sampling of 1.1''/pixel. ISOON is operated by the USAF at the National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, NM and uses an effective 15-cm aperture telescope to image the Sun. The images are acquired in a narrow 80 mÅ bandpass in the Hα line core, ±   0.4 A either side of line core and in the continuum at 6300.3Å. A 2048×  2048 CCD camera (14-micron pixels; 1.1'' sampling) obtains images with exposure times of around 10-12 milliseconds. These are corrected for dark-current fluctuations and compensated for changes in light sensitivity using flat-fields acquired immediately after the data acquisition.

Observations

The GOES light curve of the flaring active region NOAA 11121 shows that the main flare peak occurred at around 15:37 UT (Fig. [\ref=fig1]). A slow CME from this active region was observed by the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph at around 15:40 UT. The AIA and ISOON instruments did not detect this CME. However, the first filament eruption observed in AIA 304 Å and ISOON Hα near the East ribbon (see panel e of Fig. [\ref=fig2]), coincides with the CME (see online movie). An examination of this filament does not reveal clear rising motions or extensions in its morphology. This suggests that the filament eruption was either very weak, failed/remnant part of the CME, or it was directed in a vertical plane towards the observer making a detailed study very difficult.

The second filament eruption became evident at around 16:24 UT during the secondary peak seen in the GOES lightcurve (Fig. [\ref=fig1]) and is the main focus of this paper. In Fig. [\ref=fig2] we show the AIA, HMI, ROSA and ISOON images of the observed active region at 15:59 UT (22 minutes after the peak of the M5.4 flare and 25 minutes before the second filament eruption). The HMI line-of-sight magnetograms infer a multipolar magnetic field distribution. In the AIA 304, 171, 94 Å images we can identify a loop arcade, labeled LA1, connecting magnetic regions 2 and 3 (Fig. [\ref=fig2]). The high spatial resolution ROSA Hα and AIA 304, 171 Å images reveal a second loop arcade (LA2) connecting magnetic regions 3 and 4 (see Fig. [\ref=fig2]). Furthermore, the AIA 131 Å bandpasses show a third larger loop arcade (LA3) connecting magnetic regions 1 and 4 overlying the whole system.

A comparison of the AIA 304 Å images with the GOES lightcurve shows that LA1 was formed shortly after the flare peak (at around 15:37 UT) near the main flare ribbon (R2 on AIA 1700 Å panel of Fig. [\ref=fig2] and online movie). This suggests that they are classical post-flare loop arcades.

Just before the eruption, between 15:59 and 16:24 UT, the loop arcades configurations of the flare region changes dramatically. Small-scale fast plasma concentrations are seen to move from the top of the LA1 downward in both directions along the loops (see online movie). Fast jets near the brightening on the top of LA1 are also seen to be moving in the horizontal direction (see online movie). A sequence of images taken at AIA 171 Å and 335 Å wavelengths (panels a - d and f - i of Fig. [\ref=fig3]) between 16:02 and 16:24 UT show the gradual removal of the south-east part of LA1 and the appearance of a new sidelobe arcade, labelled as PRLA (post reconnection loop arcade) in Figs. [\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig6] (see also online movie). This can also be seen in the running difference images shown in panels e and j of Fig. [\ref=fig3], which have been constructed by subtracting an image at around 16:02 UT (22 minutes before eruption) from the image at 16:24 UT (just prior the eruption). The locations of dark loops inside the white dotted boxes on panels e and j of Fig. [\ref=fig3], and bright areas left of the boxes, show the removal of LA1 and appearance of PRLA, respectively.

We have used a time-series of AIA 304, 171, 131, 193, 335, 94 Å, ROSA and ISOON Hα images to construct space-time diagrams (Figs. [\ref=fig3], [\ref=fig4]). These show that at approximately 16:24 UT, shortly after the removal of LA1, the lower lying filament, located along the neutral line between the negative polarity 3 and positive polarity 5 (Fig. [\ref=fig2]), begins to rise and erupts (panels m - o of Fig. [\ref=fig3] and online movie). We fitted trajectories of plasma streams on the time-distance diagrams with a parabolic function (see Fig. [\ref=fig4]) and determined the average acceleration as 120 m s- 2(~  0.4[formula]) for the upward plasma stream. Its projected average speed along cut 1 is about 65±  15 km s- 1.

The eruption is shown in a sequence of snapshots in Fig. [\ref=fig5], which also demonstrate the morphological changes of the erupted flux rope in the AIA 304 Å and 171 Å bandpasses (see also online movie). In the initial stages the erupted loop rose in one end while the other remained fixed (panels b and b1 of Fig. [\ref=fig5]). Panels c, c1 and e, e1 of Fig. [\ref=fig5] show clear twisting motions, and a helical twist of the erupted material following the formation of an inverse γ structure (panels d and d1 of Fig. [\ref=fig5] and online movies).

Our multiwavelength observations do not show evidence that during the eruption event some of the filament material leaves the corona and develops into a CME. Instead, the erupted plasma drains back down towards the chromosphere. The AIA and ROSA Hα time-distance diagrams clearly show the downward plasma streams of the filament material (panels m and n of Fig. [\ref=fig3] and Fig. [\ref=fig4]) along cut 1 with an average projected acceleration of ~  78 m s- 1(~  0.3[formula]) and average downward speed of 60±  10 km s- 1. The bottom panel of Fig. [\ref=fig4] is a time-distance diagram along the γ-shape filament apex (along cut 4) showing downward motions of the apex plasma. Analysis of the timeseries shows that the inverted γ-shape structure fades away and finally disappears at around 17:50 UT (see online movie). We note that a slow CME from this active region observed by the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph does not seem to be associated with the filament described in this paper and is most likely related to the first eruption occurring during the main flare peak at around 15:37 UT.

Interpretation and discussion

Our observations suggest that magnetic breakout can explain the initiation of the observed filament eruption. The breakout model requires a multipolar magnetic configuration which exists in the region under investigation (see Figs. [\ref=fig2]). The high spatial resolution ROSA Hα data indicate that the filament threads located near the left part of the Hα bright ribbon (see panel k and l of Fig. [\ref=fig3] and online movie), may be sheared magnetic structures, which can store a lot of non-potential, free magnetic energy. The observed filament threads may therefore be considered as a non-potential core field with sufficient free energy for eruption. We suggest that the filament is restrained by the overarching central flux arcade, LA1, seen in the 304, 171, 94 and 335 Å AIA bandpasses (Figs. [\ref=fig2], [\ref=fig3] and online movie). LA2 (see ROSA Hα and AIA 304, 171 Å images of Fig. [\ref=fig2]) is a sidelobe loop arcade of the quadrupole with LA3 (AIA 131 Å image of Fig. [\ref=fig2]) overlying the whole system. The expansion of LA1, seen in panels a - d of Fig. [\ref=fig3], can form the current sheet between the opposite oriented polarities LA1 and LA3, and the breakout reconnection between the two arcades can result in the gradual removal of LA1. The downflow of plasma blobs along the AIA 304 Å loops could be explained as a condensation of the hot coronal plasma in the post-flare loops (LA1) due to a thermal instability, whereas the horizontal jets coming from the brightening on the top of LA1 could be the reconnection outflows. A post reconnection loop arcade system, labelled PRLA in Figs. [\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig5] begins to form. Removal of a sufficient portion of LA1 reduces the stabilising tension force, allowing the eruption of the lower lying filament material [\citep=ant1] [\citep=aul1]. It may be noted that if a part of the observed post-flare loops (LA1) are shrinking downwards as expected from the standard flare model [\citep=forb], they can reconnect with the opposite oriented filament field lines located underneath (Figs. [\ref=fig2]). This may facilitate the rise of the flux rope, together with breakout reconnection between expanding part of LA1 and LA3.

The post-eruption dynamics of the filament material show evidence of the helical kink instability, a process through which twist is transformed into writhe [\citep=rust1]. At approximately 16:39 UT, the erupted plasma developed a clear twisted flux rope structure, as seen in panels c and c1 from Fig. [\ref=fig5] (see also online movie). Over the next 20 minutes the formation of an inverse γ-shape filament occurred, and the apparent crossing of the two filament legs is observed (panels d and d1 in Fig. [\ref=fig5]). We note that the inverse γ-shape has been associated with the presence of a so-called helical writhe, which is a measure of the winding of the flux rope axis. The conservation of helicity in ideal MHD requires that the resulting writhe must be the same sign as the initial twist [\citep=rust1] [\citep=green1]. To determine the sign of the twist and writhe, we need to define which leg of the flux rope is foreground and which is background relative to the observer. Fig. [\ref=fig5] (panels d, d1) shows that the filament segment which is connected to the right footpoint is foreground as it obscures the filament segment which is connected to the second footpoint (see also online movie). This means that the writhe has a right-handed positive sign. The helical twist in the panel c and c1 of Fig. [\ref=fig5] has the same configuration. Thus, we conclude that writhe and twist both have the same polarity, therefore suggesting that the helical kink instability of a twisted magnetic flux rope is the mechanism of the formation of the inverse γ-shape flux rope.

The eruption did not lead to a coronal mass ejection and drained back onto the solar surface. There have been several observations of failed eruptions [\citep=ji1] [\citep=al1] [\citep=liu1], but it is still not clear exactly what defines the precise conditions that lead to a failed as opposed to a full eruption. According to statistics, about 44 % of the eruptions associated with M-class flares do not lead to CMEs [\citep=chen1]. [\cite=gil2] suggest that the position of the reconnection site in the inverse polarity flux rope model can determine the outcome of an eruption, with reconnection below the filament most likely to produce a full eruption, and that above to produce a failed eruption [\citep=gil1] [\citep=al1] [\citep=gil2]. Furthermore, previous observations suggest that, in the magnetic breakout or kink instability scenario, the interaction between an eruptive filament and its magnetic environment can also play an important role in determining the nature of the eruption [\citep=wil1] [\citep=gibfan1] [\citep=ji1] [\citep=jiang1]. According to [\cite=ji1], if the higher-lying magnetic field lines above the filament remain close, the eruption may not propagate into the corona although an overlying closed coronal magnetic field may not be a sufficient condition for a failed eruption to occur. The simulations of [\cite=tor1] showed that the kink instability could trigger a failed filament eruption if the overlying magnetic field decreases slowly with height. The degree of the helical twist in the filament may also determine the nature of the eruption [\citep=rust1]. Other factors can include the asymmetric confinement of the background field above the filament. This suggests that if the filament erupts asymmetrically with respect to the overlying loop arcade, it is more likely to become a failed eruption [\citep=liu1]. In the observations presented here, the erupted filament and the whole active region is overlaid by a large-scale, closed coronal loop arcade (LLA) seen in the AIA 171 and 193 Å data (Fig. [\ref=fig6]). This coronal loop system connects magnetic polarities 1 and 6 and is not symmetric with respect to the filament (Fig. [\ref=fig6]). The coronal loops in LLA do not undergo any important topological changes during the whole observing period. It appears that breakout reconnection has opened only the lower magnetic arcade (LA3) above the filament while higher field lines remained closed (Fig. [\ref=fig6]). This suggests that the eruption may be confined by this large-scale loop arcade. Unfortunately, the analysis does not reveal the precise orientation of the erupted γ-shape flux rope field with respect to LLA. Their orientation does not seems to favour magnetic reconnection. A schematic diagram presented in Fig. [\ref=fig7] describes the interpretation of the observed failed filament eruption.

Summary

We have presented multi-instrument/multi-wavelength observations of the solar eruption event in active region NOAA 11121 on 6 November 2010 using data obtained with the ROSA, SDO, and ISOON instruments. These show that the eruption process comprises the pre-eruption removal of the field lines above the filament, eruption of the filament, development of the strong helical twist into the erupted filament, formation of an inverse γ-shape structure and the draining of filament material back to the solar surface. A morphological study of this event supports that the magnetic breakout scenario and helical kink instability should be responsible for the observed evolution of the event. The large-scale, closed, overlying magnetic loop arcade may have confined the eruption. Future observations could focus on quantifying the amount of the helical twist, writhe and magnetic field.
