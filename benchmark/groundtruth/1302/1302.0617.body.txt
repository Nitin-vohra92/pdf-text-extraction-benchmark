Comment on "State-Independent Experimental Test of Quantum Contextuality in an Indivisible System"

In this Comment we argue that the experiment described in the recent Letter [\cite=Zu:2012PRL] does not allow to make conclusions about contextuality. Our main criticism is that the measurement of the observables as well as the preparation of the state manifestly depend on the chosen context. Contrary to that, contextuality is about the behavior of the same measurement device in different experimental contexts (cf. e.g.  Ref. [\cite=Bell:1966RMP] [\cite=Peres:1991JPA] [\cite=Mermin:1993RMP]).

The authors aim to experimentally demonstrate that the noncontextuality assumption is violated by quantum systems. Specifically, they report a violation of the noncontextuality inequality recently introduced by Yu an Oh [\cite=Yu:2012PRL], which is of the form

[formula]

The notation [formula] is an abbreviation denoting the expectation value of the product of the outcomes of the observables Ak and [formula]. This inequality holds for any noncontextual model, i.e., any model having preassigned values for each observable Ak, irrespective of the measurement context (the different pairs [formula]). Therefore, the experimenter must convincingly argue that the assignment of the observables is independent of the context. This is a central point in any experimental test of contextuality. For the argument leading to Eq. [\eqref=ineq] it is thus crucial that (i) the same symbol Ak always corresponds to the same measurement and (ii) the expectation value is evaluated always for the same state of the system.

In Table [\ref=tab], we list the different measurement procedures that have been used in the experiment, as provided by the supplementary material of the Letter. Clearly, except for Az1 and Ay-3, none of the observables is measured context independently. In particular, the observables Ahα (α = 0,1,2,3) are measured in each context differently, violating condition (i). In addition the input states are chosen differently for different contexts--an approach that has not been investigated before and directly violates condition (ii).

Since no experimental data or discussion concerning these issues is provided in the Letter, the only means to conclude that those different procedures actually correspond to the same physical observable is to invoke previous knowledge about the functioning of the optical devices. However, since the setup is operated on a single photon level, this actually requires to employ their quantum mechanical description. But then the experiment can merely be used to verify the predictions of quantum mechanics within the framework of quantum mechanics, rather than a to provide a proof of contextual behavior.
