Calculation of the determinant in the Wheeler-De Witt equation.

Introduction

In this theory, the space has geometry [formula] where Σ is a two dimensional compact manifold, usually a 2-Torus T2. The eignestates and eigenvalues are [\cite=scarlip]:

[formula]

where m,n are integers, and x,y angular coordinates, V0 is related to the potential function and τ  =  τ1 + iτ2 is the complex modulus asociated to a metric [\cite=elizalde],

[formula]

The zeta function asociated with the operator is;

[formula]

Then, the determinant of the operator is:

[formula]

In [\cite=nvanegas] we find that the zeta function is asociated to the Gamma function as:

[formula]

with,

[formula]

and,

[formula]

This can be wrote in a matrix form as:

[formula]

this matrix satisfies:

[formula]

Then we can define a new matrix as Ω  =  Ω' / τ2, where det   Ω    =  1, and the zeta function is:

[formula]

with,

[formula]

Some Useful Results

Let's list three equation we are going to use [\cite=nvanegas] [\cite=chan] [\cite=table]

[formula]

for the computation ahead, with this in mind and following in the same line as in [\cite=nvanegas], we now split the problem in four contributions,

[formula]

The first case is solved making (n = m = 0) in the integral ([\ref=eq:mizeta]), then we can see that under x = V0t, the gamma function is canceled,

[formula]

then,

[formula]

The second case, with (n = 0) in ([\ref=eq:list]) is:

[formula]

If we consider τ2 > 0, and using ([\ref=eq:list]), we obtain,

[formula]

And with ([\ref=eq:list]), if V0 > 0 then,

[formula]

The third contribution, with (m = 0) in ([\ref=eq:mizeta]) is:

[formula]

And again we consider τ2 > 0 for use ([\ref=eq:list]) to obtain:

[formula]

The fourth contribution, with ([formula]) in ([\ref=eq:mizeta]) and again using ([\ref=eq:list]) we obtain:

[formula]

Final Results and Conclusions

Putting together the contributions found in the last secction, replacing the parameters (α, γ) and taking the limit in ([\ref=eq:list]), we obtain the expression

[formula]

The integers "n,m" are non zero, then we can write

[formula]

after some work and using some Bessel function identities we obtain

[formula]

Then the determinant we are looking for is:

[formula]

The last expression is regular, because the Bessel function is asimptotic and the expression is multiplied by a factor [formula], then the important terms are the first in the series, at this point we will compute that limit with the help of the identity [\cite=arfken]:

[formula]

For the first values of m, and [formula] we obtain:

[formula]

It doest mean that the series converg to this value, but than this series can be wrote like a sum of the first terms of this kind. In this case the determinant is,

[formula]

Our final result ([\ref=eq:finalwdw]) is diferent that some results found in the literature, for example in [\cite=elizalde] [\cite=reg-elizalde] [\cite=some]. Maybe there is some limit in wich these result are equivalent, or maybe really there is diferent in a deep sense, the important thing is than it limit seems more simple and handle and its well bahaviour is more evident. This diference may have some interesting consecuences on some works derived from the quantization with the Wheeler-De Witt equation, in particular in brane worlds models, like in [\cite=brane1], where the Wheeler-De Witt equation is solved with first-class Dirac constraints defined in a five dimensional space, and the important determinant here is known as Morette-DeWitt determinant, wich must be solved. other nice work is [\cite=brane2], where is considered the gravity on the worldvolume of D3-brane embedded in the flat background produced by N p-branes, first clasically, and later in the quantization, the Wheeler-De Witt equation must be solved.
