Roots of characteristic polynomials and intersection points of line arrangements

Main result

We use the notation in section two to state the main results in this article. Here some basic and special notations will be explained, which will be defined again in the next section.

Let [formula] be a field of arbitrary characteristic and consider affine line arrangements in [formula]. We say an affine line arrangement A is free with exponents exp 0(A) = (d1,d2) if the cone cA of A is free with exponents (1,d1,d2). For a line H, define [formula]. Namely, this is the set of intersection points on H. Put [formula] and let χ(A,t) be the characteristic polynomial of A. Now let us state the main result in this article.

Let C be an affine line arrangement and assume that χ(C,t) = (t - a)(t - a - b) with [formula] and |a|  ≤  |a + b|. Then (1)   there are no H∈C such that [formula]. In other words, χ(C,nH)  ≥  0. (2)   There are no line [formula] such that [formula]. In other words, χ(C,nL)  ≥  0. (3)   Assume that [formula]. Then C is free if there is a line H such that [formula] or a + b. Equivalently, C is free if χ(C,nH) = 0 for some line H.

If we assume the freeness, then we can obtain a stronger geometric condition on the arrangement.

In the same notation as in Theorem [\ref=elem], assume that C is free. Then (1)   [formula] for any H∈C, and (2)   [formula] for any line [formula].

(1)   Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) and (2) are non-trivial statements only when [formula] and a < a + b. (2)   Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) gives some restriction on H∈C in terms of roots of χ(C,t). On the other hand, Theorem [\ref=elem] (2) seems to be more interesting. That is, the roots give a restriction on lines which are not belonging to C. Hence Theorem [\ref=elem] (2) says that combinatorics of C knows some information on geometry of C. (3)   The case nH = a + b of Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) when b > 0 is already known to experts. See [\cite=WY] for example.

Let us check the statement in Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3] in the following example.

(1)   The simplest but important example is a set of n-lines A in the real plane which go through the origin. Then it is obvious that nH = 1 for H∈A, nL∈{1,n - 1,n} for a line [formula] and χ(A,t) = (t - 1)(t - n + 1). This is trivial by using the property of parallel lines, but Theorem [\ref=elem] says that this holds true for all line arrangements. (2)   Let A be an affine line arrangement in [formula] defined by

[formula]

Hence |A| = 8 and

[formula]

Hence Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) and (2) say that [formula]. In fact, we can check that [formula] for H∈A and [formula] for [formula]. (3)   Let A be an affine line arrangement in [formula] defined by

[formula]

Then χ(A,t) = (t - 5)(t - 7), and it is easy to check that [formula] or 5 for any H∈A, which matches Theorem [\ref=elem] (1). Since we can check that there are no line [formula] such that [formula], Theorem [\ref=elem] (2) is satisfied. Also, Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) shows that A is free.

The proofs of Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3] are simple, but we need algebraic methods for the proof of Theorem [\ref=elem]. In particular, recent developments on exponents of two-dimensional multiarrangements (e.g., [\cite=Y], [\cite=WY] and [\cite=AN]) play the key roles.

Recall that the coefficients of χ(C,t) are the Betti numbers of the open manifold [formula] when [formula]. Also, χ(C,t) can be computed combinatorially in the arrangement cases. Hence we are interested in topologocal and combinatorial proofs of them. As far as we investigated, there are no such results similar to them.

Also, these results have a lot of applications. For example, by using Theorem [\ref=elem], we can generalize Faenzi-Vallès' theorem (Theorem [\ref=main0]) in [\cite=FV]. In Theorem [\ref=main0], the key condition is the existence of a point with multiplicity n for the arrangement A with χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r). In this generalization, the role of this point is replaced by a free arrangement with exponents (n - 1,n - s) (s  ≥  1), i.e., the following holds.

Let [formula] be a field of arbitrary characteristic and A a line arrangement such that [formula] and χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r). Assume that A contains a free arrangement B with exp 0(B) = (n - s,n - 1) (s  ≥  1). Then A is free if and only if there are no B  ⊂  C  ⊂  A such that χ(C,t) = (t - n - u + 1)(t - n + s) with u  >  r + 1.

If we remove the assumption that "B is free" from the statement in Theorem [\ref=main], then can we say something on freeness and combinatorics? In fact, we can also show the following combinatorial statement on freeness.

Let [formula] be a field of arbitrary characteristic and A a line arrangement such that [formula] and χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r). Assume that A contains an arrangement B with χ(B,t) = (t - α)(t - β) such that α  ≤  β are real numbers with α  ≤  n and n - 1  ≤  β. Then A is free if and only if there is a line H∈A such that nH∈{n,n + r}. In particular, the freeness of such A depends only on combinatorics.

Another corollary is the following generalization of the addition theorem for line arrangements. To state it, let us introduce some terminologies. Define a deletion pair of line arrangements (A,A') by A  ⊃  A' and |A'| + 1 = |A|. We say that a deletion pair (A,A') is free if both A and A' are free. Then the following addition-type theorem holds.

A deletion pair (A,A') is free if and only if χ(A,t) and χ(A',t) have a common root. In particular, the freeness of the deletion pair depends only on the combinatorics.

Also, we apply Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3] to obtain some results related to the conjecture of Terao (§ 5, Corollary [\ref=tc6]) and free arrangements over finite fields (§ 6, Theorem [\ref=finite3]).

The organization of this article is as follows. In § 2 we introduce several definitions and results for the proof. In § 3 we prove main theorems. In § 4 we show generalized Faenzi-Vallès' theorem as Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainc]. In § 5 we show an application to the conjecture of Terao when one of the roots of the characteristic polynomial is at most five. In § 6 we consider the case when the base field is a finite field.

Preliminaries

In this section let us introduce several definitions and results, some of which have already defined in section one. We will use them throughout this article. We use [\cite=OT] as a general reference on arrangement theory. Also, a recent paper [\cite=Y3] is a nice reference on exponents of two-dimensional multiarrangements.

Let [formula] be a field of arbitrary characteristic unless otherwise specified, [formula] and [formula] the coordinate ring of V. An affine arrangement C of lines in V is a finite collection of affine lines in V. Let [formula] be the intersection lattice of C. Define [formula] by μ(V) = 1, and by [formula]. Then the characteristic polynomial χ(C,t) of C is defined by

[formula]

For a line H, define [formula] and put [formula].

Let z be a new coordinate and define the cone cC of C as follows. If C is defined by a non-homogeneous polynomial equation Q = 0, then cC is defined by z(cQ) = 0, where cQ is the homogenized polynomial of Q by the coordinate z. Hence cC is a central arrangement in [formula], i.e., all planes contain the origin. For H∈C, let cH∈cC denote the homogenized linear plane of H. Let [formula] and [formula] be the module of S-derivations with a basis ∂x,∂y,∂z dual to x,y,z respectively. Let αcH be a defining linear form of cH∈cC. Hence the defining polynomial Q(cC) of the cone cC of C is [formula]. Then define

[formula]

We say that cC is free with exponents exp (cC) = (1,d1,d2) if D(cC) is a free S-module with homogeneous basis elements θE = x∂x + y∂y + z∂z, θ1, θ2 such that deg θi = di. We say that an affine arrangement C is free with exponents exp 0(C) = (d1,d2) if cC is free with exp (cC) = (1,d1,d2).

Let A be a central line arrangement and [formula] be a multiplicity. Here αH denotes a defining linear form of H∈A. Then a pair (A,m) is called a multiarrangement and we can define the logarithmic module

[formula]

Let [formula]. Since S' is two-dimensional, D(A,m) is always free. Hence we can always define its exponents exp (A,m): = (d1,d2). Here we introduce a very famous freeness criterion.

Let θ1,θ2∈D(A,m) be two derivations with deg θi = di. Then they form a basis for D(A,m) if and only if θ1 and θ2 are S'-independent and [formula].

For an affine line arrangement C and H0∈cC, let (C'',m) be the Ziegler restriction of cC onto H0 defined by [formula] and by

[formula]

The Ziegler restriction of C onto H∈C is that of cC onto cH∈cC. Let (d1(C),d2(C)) denote the exponents of the Ziegler restriction of cC onto z = 0. In general, we assume that d1(C)  ≤  d2(C). Then the following is the key theorem in this article.

Let exp (C'',m) = (d1,d2). Then χ(C,0) = b2(C)  ≥  d1d2, and the equality holds if and only if C is free.

Also, we use the results in the following papers; [\cite=T], [\cite=T1], [\cite=Z], [\cite=WY], [\cite=AN] and [\cite=A]. For the proof and application of main results, let us introduce some of them.

First, let us introduce three results. Namely, the first one is the addition theorem in [\cite=T], the second the factorization theorem in [\cite=T1], and the third the Ziegler's restriction theorem in [\cite=Z]. Note that all of these three were proved for any dimensional arrangements in these papers. Since we focus on line arrangements, we introduce the line arrangement cases of these results as follows.

Let A be an affine line arrangement and fix H∈A. Define [formula] and [formula]. Assume that χ(A,nH) = χ(A',nH) = 0. Then A is free if and only if A' is free.

Let A be a free affine line arrangement with exp 0(A) = (d1,d2). Then χ(A,t) = (t - d1)(t - d2).

If A is a free affine line arrangement with exp 0(A) = (a,b), then its Ziegler restriction (A'',m) is free with exp (A'',m) = (a,b).

The statements of Corollary [\ref=ptc] and Theorem [\ref=addition] are similar, and it is easy to see that the former is a generalization of the latter. The next two results are originally for line arrangements. The first one is originally in [\cite=WY].

Let A be a central line arrangement and m,m' be multiplicities on A such that |m| = |m'| + 1 and m(H)  ≥  m'(H) for any H∈A. If exp (A,m') = (d1,d2), then exp (A,m) = (d1 + 1,d2) or (d1,d2 + 1).

Let A be an affine line arrangement defined over a field of characteristic zero. Put χ(A,t) = (t - α)(t - β) for [formula]. For the Ziegler restriction (A'',m) of A onto H0∈A, put exp (A'',m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2. Assume that |m|  ≥  2m(H) for any H∈A'' and |A''| = :h > 2. Then (1)   d2 - d1  ≤  h - 2, and (2)   ||α| - |β||  ≤  h - 2. In particular, A is free if ||α| - |β||∈{h - 2,h - 3}.

Proof. The statement (1) is the same as Theorem 3.5 in [\cite=A]. Also, the statement (2) is essentially proved in [\cite=A]. That is, combine [formula] (by Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga]) and α  +  β = d1 + d2 = |A| = |m| with (1) and Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga]. [formula]

When (A'',m) satisfies the condition |m|  ≥  2m(H) for any H∈A'' in Theorem [\ref=h-2], we say that (A'',m), or A is balanced. The following is famous in the theory of two-dimensional multiarrangements. We give a proof for the completeness.

Let A be an affine line arrangement which is not balanced. Then the freeness of A depends only on L(A).

Proof. By definition, the Ziegler restriction (A'',m) of A is not balanced. We may assume that H0: = {x = 0} satisfies 2m(H0) > |m|. Let φ: = (Q(A'',m) / xm(H0))∂y. Then clearly φ∈D(A'',m) is a non-zero derivation of the smallest degree. Hence exp (A'',m) is combinatorially determined as (|m| - m(H0),m(H0)) and Theorem [\ref=saito] completes the proof. [formula]

Some of the following statements are well-known (e.g., see [\cite=WY]), but we give the proof for the completeness.

Let A be a central line arrangement with |A| = n, m be a multiplicity on A and put exp (A,m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2. (1)   If |m|  ≥  2n - 2, then di  ≥  n - 1. (2)   If |m|  ≤  2n - 2, then d1 = |m| - n + 1, d2 = n - 1. (3)   Let |m| = α  +  β with [formula] and α  <  β. If α < n - 1  <  β, then α  <  d1  ≤  d2  <  β.

Proof. (1)   Note that exp (A) = (1,n - 1). Take any multiplicity m' such that m(H)  ≥  m'(H)  ≥  1 for any H∈A and |m'| = 2n - 2. Let θE be the Euler derivation. Then it is easily checked that θ: = (Q(A,m') / Q(A))θE∈D(A,m') is a non-zero element in D(A',m) of degree n - 1 such that there are no [formula] satisfying fθ' = θ for f∈S' with deg f > 0. Hence Theorem [\ref=saito] implies that exp (A,m') = (n - 1,n - 1). Since D(A,m')  ⊃  D(A,m), we complete the proof. (2)   Use the same θ = (Q(A,m) / Q(A))θE as in the proof of (1). Then deg θ = |m| - n + 1 and it is clear that θ is a non-zero element of D(A,m) of the smallest degree. Hence Theorem [\ref=saito] completes the proof. (3)   First assume that α  ≥  d1. Then the construction of θ in the proofs above shows that d2 = n - 1. Hence |m| = d1 + d2  ≤  α + n - 1  <  α  +  β = |m|, which is a contradiction. Hence d1  >  α. Assume that d2  ≥  β. Then |m| = d1 + d2  >  α  +  β = |m|, which is a contradiction. Hence d2  <  β. [formula]

Let A be a central line arrangement and m,m' be multiplicities on A such that m(H)  ≥  m'(H) for any H∈A. Put exp (A,m') = (d1,d2) and exp (A,m) = (e1,e2) with d1  ≤  d2, e1  ≤  e2. Then d1  ≤  e1, d2  ≤  e2.

Proof. Let θ1,θ2 (resp:φ1,φ2) be a basis for D(A,m') (resp:D(A,m)) with deg θi = di (resp:deg φi = ei). Since D(A,m)  ⊂  D(A,m'), it is clear that e1  ≥  d1. Assume that e2  <  d2. Then φ2 = fθ1 for f∈S'. Put φ1 = gθ1 + hθ2 for g,h∈S'. Then the inequality e1  ≤  e2 < d2 shows that h = 0. Hence φ1 and φ2 are S'-dependent, which is a contradiction. [formula]

The next proposition may be known to experts, but we give a proof for the completeness.

Let A  ⊃  B be affine line arrangements such that χ(A,t) = (t - a)(t - c), χ(B,t) = (t - a)(t - b) with [formula]. Assume that a  ≤  b  ≤  c. Then A is free if B is free.

Proof. Assume that B is free. Then (d1(B),d2(B)) = (a,b) by Theorem [\ref=ziegler]. By Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga], it suffices to show that (d1(A),d2(A))  =  (a,c). If not, then Lemma [\ref=an2] and Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga] show a contradiction. [formula]

The conditions in Proposition [\ref=elem5] are essential. Consider

[formula]

Then exp 0(A) = (3,5),  exp 0(C) = (1,3) and χ(B,t) = (t - 3)2, but B is not free.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3]

In this section we prove main results introduced in section one.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=elem]. If both a and b are not real numbers, then |a| = |a + b|. Hence there is nothing to prove. So in the proof below, we may assume that a and b are both real numbers. Also, we may assume that a and a + b are both non-negative since the roots of χ(C,t) = t2 - |C|t + b2(C) are apparently non-negative. Hence in the below, we may replace |a| and |a + b| by a and a + b respectively.

(1)   Assume that such H∈C exists. Let (C'',m) be the Ziegler restriction of C onto H and let |C''| = nH + 1. Then exp (C'') = (1,nH) with a < nH < a + b. Let exp (C'',m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2. Then it follows that a < d1  ≤  d2  <  a + b by Lemma [\ref=elem2] (3). Hence d1d2 > a(a + b) = b2(C), which contradicts Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga].

(2)   If b = 0, then there is nothing to show. Note that the solutions a and a + b of χ(C,t) = 0 are of the form

[formula]

Since |C| and b2(C) are both non-negative integers, [formula] implies that b  ≥  1.

Assume that there is a line [formula] such that a < nL < a + b. Let [formula]. Since χ(A,t) = t2 - (2a + b + 1)t + a(a + b) + nL, the solutions of χ(A,t) = 0 are

[formula]

Let α: = (2a + b + 1) / 2 and [formula]. Note that [formula] since (b + 1)2  ≥  4b and a + b > nL. Since negative real numbers cannot be a solution of χ(A,t), we have [formula]. Also, using a < nL < a + b, easy computations show that

[formula]

Now apply Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) to the arrangement A and L∈A. Then we know that a + 1  ≤  nL  <  a + b cannot occur. Hence to complete the proof, it suffices to show that a < nL < a + 1 cannot occur.

Assume that there exists the real number e such that 0 < e < 1 and [formula]. Hence a + e is the integer satisfying a < a + e < a + 1. Then

[formula]

Let (A'',m) be the Ziegler restriction of A onto L. Put exp (A'',m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2. Assume that d1  ≤  a. Then Lemma [\ref=elem2] (2) and the fact that exp (A'') = (1,a + e) show that d2 = a + e. Thus 2a + b + 1 = d1 + d2  ≤  2a + e < 2a + b + 1, which is a contradiction. Hence a < d1. In particular, a + e  ≤  d1. Then Lemma [\ref=an1] shows that d1d2  ≥  (a + e)(a + b + 1 - e). So the inequalities b  ≥  1 and 0  <  e  <  1 imply that

[formula]

which contradicts Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga].

(3)   If [formula], replace C by [formula] and we may assume that H∈C by Theorem [\ref=addition]. First assume that [formula]. Let (C'',m) be the Ziegler restriction of C onto H. Then exp (C'',m) is combinatorially determined as (a,a + b) by Lemma [\ref=elem2] (2). Hence C is free by Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga]. Next assume that [formula]. Then exp (C'') = (1,a). Hence Lemma [\ref=elem2] (1) shows that di  ≥  a for exp (C'',m) = (d1,d2). Again by Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga], we know that a(a + b)  ≥  d1d2. So Lemma [\ref=an2] implies that d1 = a, d2 = a + b, which implies the freeness of C by Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga].[formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=elem3]. (1)   By Theorem [\ref=elem], it suffices to show that [formula] for H∈C. Assume not. Then Lemma [\ref=elem2] (2) shows that d1d2 < a(a + b) for exp (C'',m) = (d1,d2), which contradicts Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga].

(2)   First assume that a = 0. This occurs only when all lines in C are parallel. In this case, Corollary [\ref=elem3] is obvious. Hence we may assume that a > 0.

Since there is at least one point in L(C) by the previous paragraph, it holds that χ(C,0) > 0 and |C|  ≥  2. Also, it is well-known that χ(C,1)  ≥  0 (e.g., by Zaslavsky's theorem, [\cite=Za]). Since 1  ≤  |C| / 2, the non-negativity of χ(C,0) and χ(C,1) implies that a  ≥  1. Hence in the arguments below, we assume that a  ≥  1.

By Theorem [\ref=elem], it suffices to show that [formula] for any line [formula]. Assume not and put [formula]. Let (C1'',m1) be the Ziegler restriction of C1 onto L and [formula]. Then b2(C1) = b2(C) + n. On the other hand, exp (C1'',m1) = (a + 1,a + b) or (a,a + b + 1) because exp (C'',m) = (d1,d2) =  exp 0(C) = (a,a + b) and Lemma [\ref=an1]. Hence a  ≥  1 implies that b2(C1) = b2(C) + n < a(a + b + 1)  ≤  (a + 1)(a + b), which contradicts Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga]. [formula]

Proof of Corollary [\ref=ptc]. Let [formula] be a common root of χ(A,t) and χ(A',t). Then the famous deletion-restriction formula (e.g., see [\cite=OT], Corollary 2.57) shows that

[formula]

where [formula]. By definition, [formula]. Hence [formula], and both characteristic polynomials factorize into

[formula]

Thus Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) shows the freeness of both arrangements.[formula]

Corollary [\ref=ptc] makes several proofs of the freeness of line arrangements easier, especially those related to extended Catalan and Shi arrangements. For example in [\cite=A0], the freeness of several deformations of the Coxeter arrangements of the type A2 are proved by checking all the addition steps. However, if we use Corollary [\ref=ptc], it suffices to find a line H on each deformations such that nH is one of the roots of their characteristic polynomials.

Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) and Corollary [\ref=ptc] are useful as we saw above, but they are not enough to show freeness of all arrangements combinatorially. Recall the affine line arrangement A consisting of all edges and diagonals of a regular pentagon. Then χ(A,t) = (t - 5)2 and A is free, but [formula] for any H∈A. Hence we cannot apply Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) and Corollary [\ref=ptc] to show its freeness combinatorially. Of course, it is easy to see that there is a line [formula] such that [formula]. Hence Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) shows that A is free, but this proof is not combinatorial. Also, it is easy to check that A contains a free arrangement with exponents (3,3), but A does not satisfy the sufficient condition of freeness in Theorem [\ref=main]. Hence the condition in Theorem [\ref=main] is essential.

Proof of Theorems [\ref=main] and [\ref=mainc]

Before the proof of Theorem [\ref=main] as an application of Theorem [\ref=elem], let us recall the following Faenzi-Vallès' theorem.

Let A be an affine 2-arrangement in [formula] such that [formula] and that its localization B  ⊂  A at the origin consists of h-lines with n  ≤  h  ≤  n + r + 1. If χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r), then A is free.

If A contains a point with multiplicity h with n  ≤  h  ≤  n + r + 1, then it implies that A contains a free arrangement B with exp 0(B) = (1,h - 1) and n - 1  ≤  h - 1  ≤  n + r. Hence Theorem [\ref=main] generalizes Theorem [\ref=main0] in the sense of freeness. Also, note that Theorem [\ref=main] holds true not only over [formula] but also all fields of any characteristic.

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=main], let us introduce the following corollary and lemma by using the results in the previous section. The first corollary might be similar to non-freeness criterion in [\cite=K].

Let A  ⊃  B be an affine line arrangement such that χ(A,t) = (t - a)(t - b), χ(B,t) = (t - c)(t - d) with integers a  ≤  b, c  ≤  d and B is free. If [formula], then for [formula], it holds that [formula].

Proof. Obvious by Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3]. [formula]

Let A and B be affine line arrangements such that A  ⊃  B with [formula]. Then we can order lines of [formula] in such a way that, for [formula] and [formula], it holds that [formula].

Proof. We use induction on i. First, let [formula] be a line such that [formula]. Then for any [formula], it is obvious that [formula]. Assume that [formula] satisfy the condition in the statement. Then choose [formula] such that [formula]. Then it is obvious that [formula] for any [formula].[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]. First assume that such C does not exist. If there is a line H∈A such that nH = n or n + r, then Theorem [\ref=elem] shows that A is free. Assume that nH  ≠  n, n + r. Again by Theorem [\ref=elem], we may assume that nH  <  n or nH > n + r. Also, by Corollaries [\ref=elem3] and [\ref=coro], [formula] for [formula].

Let [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=increase], we may assume that [formula] for [formula]. By the previous paragraph, we know that [formula]. Note that [formula].

Case 1. Assume that n1 = n - s.

Case 1-1. Assume that n2 > n - s. Then B1 is free with exp 0(B1) = (n,n - s). By Theorem [\ref=elem], n2  ≥  n. Since n  ≤  n2  ≤  nr + s + 1  ≠  n, we have nr + s + 1 > n + r by Theorem [\ref=elem]. Hence

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Case 1-2. Assume that [formula] for some u > 1. Then Bu is free with exp 0(Bu) = (n + u - 1,n - s). If r  ≥  u - 1, then ni  ≥  n + u - 1 > n - 1 for i > u by Corollary [\ref=elem3] and n + u - 1  ≤  n + r. Hence

[formula]

because of 0  ≤  r + 1 - u  ≤  r and nr + s + 1 > n + r, which is a contradiction.

If r < u - 1, then there exists B  ⊂  C  ⊂  A such that χ(C,t) = (t - n - u + 1)(t - s) and r < u - 1, which contradicts the assumption.

Case 2. So we may assume that n1  ≥  n - 1. If nr + s + 1 = n - 1, then

[formula]

which is a contradiction. Hence nr + s + 1  ≥  n. By the assumption and Theorem [\ref=elem], it holds that nr + s + 1 > n + r. Hence

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Conversely, assume that such C exists. Then Proposition [\ref=elem5] shows that C is also free. Hence its Ziegler restriction has the exponents (n + u - 1,n - s) with n + u - 1 > n + r. Then b2(A)  -  d1(A)d2(A) = n(n + r) - d1(A)d2(A) > 0 since d2(A) > n + r by Lemma [\ref=an2]. Hence Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga] implies that A is not free. [formula]

It is natural to ask whether the same statement as in Theorem [\ref=main] holds true for s  ≤  0. The answers is affirmative as follows.

In the same notation and condition as in Theorem [\ref=main], we assume that - r  ≤  s  ≤  0. Then A is free if and only if nH∈{n,n + r} for some H∈A.

Proof. The "if" part follows by Theorem [\ref=elem] (3). Conversely, assume that A is free and [formula]. Then Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) shows that nH < n or nH > n + r. Since A is free, Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga] and Lemma [\ref=elem2] (2) imply that nH < n. Let [formula]. Put Bi and ni in the same way as in Theorem [\ref=main] by Lemma [\ref=increase]. Then Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3] show that n - 1  ≤  n1  ≤  nr + s + 1  ≤  n - 1. However,

[formula]

which is a contradiction. [formula]

Before the proof of Theorem [\ref=mainc], we need the following lemma.

Let A  ⊃  B be the same arrangments as in Theorem [\ref=mainc]. Let us order [formula] in such a way that [formula] and [formula] for [formula] by Lemma [\ref=increase]. Let a be the smallest integer satisfying α  ≤  a. Assume that nf  ≤  n - 1, n - 1  <  β and put χ(Bi,t) = (t - αi)(t - βi) with [formula]. Then αi and βi are both real numbers, and αi + 1  ≤  αi  ≤  α  ≤  β  ≤  βi  ≤  βi + 1 for any i. In particular, ni  ≤  a for [formula].

Proof. Let us prove by induction on i. Since χ(B,t) = (t - α)(t - β), Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) shows the case i = 0. Assume that the statement is true when i  ≤  k. Since n - 1  <  β  ≤  βk, it holds that nk + 1  ≤  αk by Theorem [\ref=elem] (2). Since

[formula]

the roots of this polynomial are of the form

[formula]

Since αk  ≥  nk + 1, it follows that [formula]. Also, it is easy to see that t-  ≤  αk and βk  ≤  t+. Hence Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) completes the proof. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=mainc]. The "if" part follows from Theorem [\ref=elem] (3). Assume that A is free and there are no H∈A such that nH∈{n,n + r}. By Lemma [\ref=balanced] we may assume that nH  ≤  n + r. Hence Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) shows that nH  ≤  n - 1 for H∈A. Let us order [formula] in such a way that [formula] and [formula] for [formula] by Lemma [\ref=increase].

Case 1. Assume that α  ≤  n - 1  ≤  β. If β = n - 1, then

[formula]

which is a contradiction. Hence we may assume that n - 1  <  β.

Let a,b be integers such that α  ≤  a  <  α + 1 and β - 1 < b  ≤  β. Hence α  +  β = a + b. Since [formula], it holds that a  ≤  n - 1  ≤  b and αβ  ≤  ab. Since n - 1  <  β, we may apply Lemma [\ref=a] to obtain that ni  ≤  a. Hence

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Case 2. Assume that n - 1 < α  ≤  β  <  n. Then α  +  β = 2n - 1 and [formula]. Hence

[formula]

which is a contradiction.

Case 3. Assume that n - 1  <  α  ≤  n, n  ≤  β. Let a and b be the same integers as in the Case 1. Hence n  ≤  b and a = n. Since ni  ≤  n - 1 and n  ≤  β, we may apply Lemma [\ref=a] to obtain that ni  ≤  a. Hence

[formula]

The equality holds only when [formula], which contradicts nf  ≤  n - 1. [formula]

Applications related to the conjecture of Terao

In this section we study the relation between the conjecture of Terao and the results in the previous sections.

First, let us show the following proposition, which is a generalization of Theorem [\ref=main] in a special case.

Let A be an affine line arrangement such that χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r) with [formula] and [formula]. Assume that A contains a free subarrangement B with exp 0(B) = (n - 2,n - 2). Then A is free if and only if nH = n or n + r for some H∈A.

Proof. The "if" part follows by Theorem [\ref=elem] (3). Assume that A is free and [formula]. Then nH > n + r or n - 2  ≤  nH < n by Theorem [\ref=elem] and Corollary [\ref=elem3]. Also, nH > n + r implies the non-freeness of A by Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga] and Lemma [\ref=elem2] (2). Hence we may assume that nH < n.

Let [formula]. Put [formula]. Then for [formula], we may assume that [formula] by Lemma [\ref=increase]. Also, Corollary [\ref=elem3] shows that n - 2  ≤  n1. Let u  ≥  1 be the integer such that ni = n - 2 if i  ≤  u and ni = n - 1 if i > u. Then an easy computation shows that u =  - r < 0, which is a contradiction. [formula]

Theorem [\ref=n-2] has the following corollary.

Let A be an affine line arrangement.

(1)   If χ(A,t) = (t - 2)(t - 2 - r) with r > 0, then the freeness of A depends only on combinatorics. (2)   If L(A) contains a point and χ(A,t) = (t - 3)(t - 3 - r) with r  >  0, then the freeness of A depends only on combinatorics.

Proof. (1)   Since A contains an empty arrangement with exponents (0,0), Corollary [\ref=n-2] completes the proof. (2)   Since A contains a Boolean arrangement with exponents (1,1), Corollary [\ref=n-2] completes the proof. [formula]

The following can be proved by the same way as in Theorem [\ref=n-2].

Let A be an affine line arrangement such that χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r) with [formula].

(1)   Assume that r  ≥  2 and A contains a free subarrangement B with exp 0(B) = (n - 2,n - 3). Then A is free if and only if nH = n or n + r for some H∈A.

(2)   Assume that r  ≥  4 and A contains a free subarrangement B with exp 0(B) = (n - 3,n - 3). Then A is free if and only if nH = n or n + r for some H∈A.

On the conjecture of Terao, which asserts that the freeness of an arrangement A depends only on its combinatorics L(A), we can give a few contribution by using these with Theorem [\ref=h-2]. The conjecture of Terao for line arrangements in [formula] is confirmed when |A|  ≤  10 by Wakefield-Yuzvinsky ([\cite=WY], Corollary 7.5), and |A|  ≤  11 by Faenzi-Vallès. ([\cite=FV], Theorem 5).

Now using the results in this article, first, we can show the following.

Let A be an affine line arrangement in [formula] such that χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r) with [formula]. If r  ≥  n - 3, then the freeness of A depends only on L(A).

Proof. Let (A'',m) be the Ziegler restriction of cA onto {z = 0}. By Lemma [\ref=balanced], we may assume that A and (A'',m) are balanced. Put exp (A'',m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2. By Theorem [\ref=h-2] (2), we know that the combinatorial invariant h: = |A''|  ≥  r + 2. When h = r + 2 or r + 3, the freeness of A is confirmed by Theorem [\ref=h-2] (2). Assume that h  ≥  r + 4  ≥  n + 1. Then Theorem [\ref=elem] (1) shows that [formula], and Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) shows that A is free when h = n + 1 or n + r + 1. Also, the non-freeness of A when h > n + r + 1 is checked in [\cite=WY], or by applying Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga] and Lemma [\ref=elem2] (2). [formula]

Using Corollary [\ref=tc], in this article, we check the conjecture of Terao from a different point of view from [\cite=WY] and [\cite=FV]. Namely, we prove the conjecture under the restriction on the roots of characteristic polynomials, not on the number of lines.

Let A be an affine line arrangement in [formula] such that χ(A,t) = (t - n)(t - n - r) with [formula]. If [formula], then the freeness of A depends only on L(A).

Proof. If [formula], then the conjecture of Terao is easy to check. Assume that n + r∈{2,3,4,5}. Then [\cite=WY] and [\cite=FV] complete the proof. So we may assume that n∈{2,3,4,5}. Also, the case r = 0 can be verified by [\cite=WY] and [\cite=FV]. So assume that r > 0.

Assume that n = 2. Then Corollary [\ref=coro2] (1) completes the proof. Assume that n = 3. Then a point is contained in L(A). Hence Corollary [\ref=coro2] (2) completes the proof.

Assume that n = 4. By Lemma [\ref=balanced], we may assume that A is balanced. Then Corollary [\ref=tc] verifies the statement when r  ≥  1. Hence it suffices to check when χ(A,t) = (t - 4)2, which is checked in [\cite=WY] and [\cite=FV].

Assume that n = 5. By Lemma [\ref=balanced], we may assume that A is balanced. Then Corollary [\ref=tc] verifies the statement when r  ≥  2. Hence it suffices to check when χ(A,t) = (t - 5)(t - 6) or (t - 5)2, which is checked in [\cite=FV]. [formula]

The case over finite fields

In this section let us consider the case when [formula] is a finite field [formula]. We give an another proof of Theorem 10 in [\cite=Y2]. Also, we give a new sufficient condition for freeness which is a similar result to that in [\cite=Y2]. Namely, in [\cite=Y2], it is shown that an arrangement which has q as the root of the characteristic polynomial is free. Here we show that the same holds true when q - 1 is a root.

In this section we use the following setup. Let [formula] be a finite field of cardinality q = pn for a prime number p and [formula]. Recall that, for an affine arrangement A in V, it holds that

[formula]

See Theorem 2.69 in [\cite=OT] for example. Now consider a multiarrangement (A,m) in V. Put exp (A,m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2.

Assume that m(H)  ≤  q for any H∈A. Then (1)   the inequality d1  <  q < d2 cannot occur. (2)   If |m|  ≥  2q, then d1 = q. (3)   If |m|  =  2q - 1, then d2 = q.

Proof. (1)   Let θ1,θ2 be a basis for D(A,m) with deg θi = di. Assume that d1  <  q < d2. Note that φ: = xq∂x + yq∂y∈D(A,m), which is of degree q. Hence φ = fθ1 for some polynomial f. Since φ has no divisors in [formula], this is a contradiction. (2)   By (1) and |A| = d1 + d2  ≥  2q, we know that d2  ≥  d1  ≥  q. Since φ∈D(A,m), we know that d1  ≤  q , which completes the proof. (3)   By assumption, d2  ≥  q. If d2 > q, then d1  <  q  <  d2, which is a contradiction. [formula]

Let A be an affine line arrangement in V. (1)   If χ(A,q) = 0, then A is free. (2)   If |A|  ≥  2q - 1 and A is free, then χ(A,q) = 0.

Proof. Let (A'',m) be the Ziegler restriction of cA onto z = 0. Put exp (A'',m) = (d1,d2) with d1  ≤  d2. Note that d1 + d2 = |A|. Also, note that we may apply Proposition [\ref=finite] since the base field is [formula].

(1)   Let χ(A,t) = (t - q)(t - r). Note that q + r = d1 + d2 = |A| = |m|. First assume that r  ≤  q. Then Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga] implies that qr  ≥  d1d2. Hence d1  ≤  r  ≤  q  ≤  d2. By Proposition [\ref=finite] (1), we know that q = d2. Hence A is free by Theorem [\ref=yoshinaga].

Second assume that r > q. Then again the inequalities d1  ≤  q  <  r  ≤  d2 and Proposition [\ref=finite] (1) show that d1 = q, which implies the freeness.

(2)   Since |m| = |A|  ≥  2q - 1, Proposition [\ref=finite] (2) and (3) imply that d1 = q or d2 = q. Then the freeness of A, Theorems [\ref=factorization] and [\ref=ziegler] complete the proof. [formula]

By applying Theorem [\ref=elem], we can prove the following new result on arrangements in [formula].

Let A be an affine arrangement in [formula]. If χ(A,q - 1) = 0, then A is free.

Proof. Put χ(A,t) = (t - q + 1)(t - q + r) with [formula]. Since [formula], we know that [formula], and A is free if r = 0 by Corollary [\ref=finite2]. Assume that r  ≥  1. Since χ(A,0)  ≥  0, it holds that χ(A,q) = r  ≤  q. Let [formula] and we may assume that p1 is the origin. Then there are (q + 1)-lines containing p1 and not belonging to A. Hence there is at least one line [formula] such that p1∈L and [formula] for [formula]. Then [formula]. Hence Theorem [\ref=elem] (3) shows that A is free. [formula]
