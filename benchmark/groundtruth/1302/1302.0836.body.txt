Introduction

The Liénard type second order nonlinear differential equation of the form [\cite=Lien1] [\cite=Lien2]

[formula]

where f(x) and g(x) are arbitrary real functions of x, with f(x),g(x)∈C∞  (I), defined on a real interval [formula], as well as its generalization, the Levinson-Smith type equation [\cite=Lev]

[formula]

where a dot represents the derivative with respect to the time t, and f is a function of x and [formula], plays an important role in many areas of electronics (where Eq. ([\ref=1]) appears as the Raylegh or van der Pol equation), cardiology (modeling the electric heart activity), neurology (modeling neurons activity), biology, mechanics, seismology, chemistry, physics and cosmology [\cite=vdp] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=Polh] [\cite=F] [\cite=N] [\cite=Glass] [\cite=4] [\cite=5] [\cite=Pol1] [\cite=Sal1] [\cite=Sal2].

A particular type of the general Liénard equation, the van der Pol equation [\cite=vdp] [\cite=2] [\cite=3]

[formula]

where μ is a positive parameter, describing a non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping, is extensively applied in both the physical and biological sciences. In the 1920's the Dutch physicist van der Pol, when he was an engineer working for Philips Company, studied the differential equation ([\ref=vdp]), which describes the circuit of a vacuum tube. A few years after, the electric activity of the heart rate was modeled by using a Liénard type model [\cite=Polh]. In the 1960's Fitzhugh [\cite=F] and Nagumo et al. [\cite=N] extended the van der Pol equation in a planar field as a model for action potentials of neurons. The van der Pol equation, originally introduced to describe relaxation oscillators in electronic circuits, has been frequently used in theoretical models of the heart function [\cite=Glass] [\cite=4] [\cite=5]. The van der Pol equation is a useful phenomenological model for the heartbeat, since it displays many of those features supposedly occurring in the biological setting, as complex periodicity, entrainment, and chaotic behavior [\cite=Glass] [\cite=4] [\cite=5].

Most models based on chemical kinetics can be formulated as Liénard type coupled nonlinear first-order rate equations in several variables [\cite=Pol1]. The first-order approximation for the Liénard system works well near a bifurcation point, with higher-order terms being required the further the system is from the bifurcation point. The dynamics of a scalar inflaton field with a symmetric double-well potential can also be formulated mathematically as a Liénard system [\cite=Sal1] [\cite=Sal2]. For this case one can prove rigorously the existence of a limit cycle in its phase space, and, by using analytical and numerical arguments one can show that the limit cycle is stable, and its period can be obtained by an analytical formula.

The Liénard type equations can also be used to model fluid mechanical phenomena. The linearly forced isotropic turbulence can be described in terms of a cubic Liénard equation with linear damping of the form [\cite=Ran]

[formula]

where a, b, c and d are constants, also naturally appear in the mathematical description of some important astrophysical phenomena. For example, the time-dependence φ(t) of the perturbations of the stationary solutions of spherically symmetric accretion processes can be described by a generalized Liénard type equation of the form [\cite=accr]

[formula]

where ε is a small parameter, and V(φ) is the potential of the system, with the prime indicating the derivative with respect to φ. A dynamical systems analysis of this Liénard equation reveals a saddle point in real time, with the implication that when the perturbation is extended into the nonlinear regime, instabilities will develop in the accreting system.

From a physical point of view, the Liénard equation represents the generalization of the equation of damped oscillations, [formula], where γ and ω2 are constant parameters, respectively [\cite=Ben]. For γ = 0 we obtain the equation of the linear harmonic oscillator, which represents one of the fundamental equations of both classical and quantum physics. Generally, a linear oscillation can be described by the equation [formula].

The mathematical properties of the Liénard type of equations have been intensively investigated from both mathematical and physical points of view, and their study remains an active field of research in mathematical physics [\cite=litm2] [\cite=litm1] [\cite=litn] [\cite=lit0] [\cite=lit1] [\cite=lit2] [\cite=lit3] [\cite=litp] [\cite=lit4] [\cite=lit5] [\cite=lit6]. Several methods of integrability, like the Lie symmetries method [\cite=Lie1] [\cite=Lie2] and the Weierstrass integrability, introduced in [\cite=Wei1], were used to study the Liénard equation, and the relations between the Riccati and Liénard equations, respectively. Liénard systems which have a generalized Weierstrass first integral, or a generalized Weierstrass inverse integrating factor, were studied in [\cite=Wei2] .

It is the purpose of the present paper to introduce some exactly integrable classes of the Liénard equation, Eq. ([\ref=1]), whose solutions can be obtained in an exact analytical form, and to formulate the integrability condition for this class of differential equations. To obtain the functional form of the integrable Liénard type equations we reduce them first to an Abel type equation of the form y' = p(x)y3 + q(x)y2 [\cite=Pol] [\cite=kamke]. Then, we apply to the latter Abel equation an integrability condition, equivalent to the initial Liénard equation, that was obtained by Chiellini [\cite=Chiel] [\cite=kamke]. In fact, the Chiellini condition has been recently used for the study of the Abel differential equations, as well as for the second order differential equations reducible to an Abel type equation, in [\cite=Ban] [\cite=Mak1] [\cite=Mak2] [\cite=Mak3] [\cite=Rosu1] [\cite=Rosu2].

Bandic [\cite=Ban] studied the non-linear differential equation y'' + ψ(y)y'2  +  φ(y)y' + f(y) = 0, and he did show that it can be solved by using quadratures if [formula] and [formula], where F(y) and G(y) are the coefficients of the integrable Abel equation w' = F(y)w3 + G(y)w2. The integrability of this Liénard type equation was obtained by using the Chiellini condition.

In [\cite=Rosu1] the differential Chiellini integrability condition was reformulated in an integral form, and the general form of the solution of the Abel equation was obtained in a simpler form. The Chiellini integrability condition of the first order first kind Abel equation dy / dx = f(x)y2 + g(x)y3 was extended to the case of the general Abel equation of the form dy / dx = a(x) + b(x)y + f(x)yα - 1 + g(x)yα, where [formula] and α > 1, in [\cite=Har2].

There are several other methods that can be used for the integration of the general Abel type equation y' = p(x)y3  +  q(x)y2  +  r(x)y  +  s(x) [\cite=kamke]. If y  =  yl(x) is a particular solution of the general Abel equation, then by means of the transformations [formula], where [formula], the Abel can be transformed into du / dx + Φ1 / u + Φ2 = 0, where Φ1x) = p(x)E2(x), and [formula]. Therefore, if yl =  - q(x) / 3p(x), then Φ2  =  0, and the general solution of the Abel equation can be obtained from the integration of a differential equation with separable variables.

Therefore it turns out that, if the coefficients f(x) and g(x) of the Liénard equation satisfy two specific conditions, then the general solution of the Liénard equation can be obtained in an exact analytical form. Some examples of exactly integrable Liénard equations, of physical interest, are also considered. The generalization of the method to the case of the Levinson-Smith type equations of the form ([\ref=lev]) is briefly discussed.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=sect2], we introduce the Abel equation representation for the Liénard equation, and we formulate the integrability condition of the first order Abel equation. In Section [\ref=sect3], we obtain the general solution of the Liénard type equations satisfying the integrability condition of the Abel equation. The exact solutions of some non-linear Liénard type differential equations are obtained in Section [\ref=sect4]. We discuss and conclude our results in Section [\ref=sect5].

Reduction of the Liénard equation to an integrable Abel type equation

As a first step in our study of the Liénard equation ([\ref=1]) we reduce it to an Abel type first order non-linear differential equation. Then, by using an integrability condition for this equation, which involves a differential relation between the coefficients f(x) and g(x) of the equations, we obtain the general solution of the Liénard equation in an exact parametric form.

By denoting [formula], the Liénard equation ([\ref=1]) can be written as

[formula]

By introducing a new dependent variable v = 1 / u, Eq. ([\ref=2]) takes the form of the standard first kind Abel differential equation,

[formula]

The Chiellini integrability condition for the reduced Abel equation

In this context, an exact integrability condition for the Abel equation Eq. ([\ref=3]) was obtained by Chiellini [\cite=Chiel] (see also [\cite=kamke]), and can be formulated as the Chiellini Lemma as follows:

Chiellini Lemma. If the coefficients f(x) and g(x) of a first kind Abel type differential equation of the form

[formula]

satisfy the condition

[formula]

where [formula], then the Abel Eq. ([\ref=4]) can be exactly integrated.

In order to prove the Chiellini Lemma we introduce a new dependent variable w defined as [\cite=Chiel] [\cite=kamke]

[formula]

Then Eq. ([\ref=4]) can be written as

[formula]

On the other hand, the condition given by Eq. ([\ref=5]) can be written in an equivalent form as

[formula]

Therefore Eq. ([\ref=6]) becomes

[formula]

which is a first order separable differential equation, with the general solution given by

[formula]

With the use of the condition ([\ref=5]), the left hand side of Eq. ([\ref=7]) can be written as [\cite=Rosu1]

[formula]

where C0 is an arbitrary constant of integration. Therefore the general solution of Eq. ([\ref=6_1]) is obtained as

[formula]

where [formula] is an arbitrary constant of integration, and

[formula]

respectively. Eq. ([\ref=sol]) determines w as a function of x.

The integrability condition given by Eq. ([\ref=5]) can be written as

[formula]

representing a first order linear differential equation in g. As a function of g, the function f satisfies the differential equation

[formula]

In order to solve Eq. ([\ref=c2]) we introduce a new dependent variable f(x) = 1 / σ(x), and by denoting σ2(x) = ξ(x), we obtain a first order differential equation for ξ,

[formula]

Therefore the Chiellini Lemma can be reformulated as:

Lemma 1. If the coefficients f(x) and g(x) of the Abel Eq. ([\ref=4]) satisfy the conditions

[formula]

or

[formula]

where C1, C2, and k are arbitrary constants, the Abel equation is exactly integrable, and its solution is given by

[formula]

where the functions F(w,k) are given by Eqs. ([\ref=sol2]). A similar result was obtained in [\cite=Rosu1].

The Chiellini integrability condition for the general Abel equation

The Chiellini Lemma can be extended to the general Abel equation of the form

[formula]

where a(x),b(x),f(x),g(x)∈C∞  (I) are defined on a real interval [formula], and [formula], as follows. By introducing a new function p(x), defined as

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=gen]) becomes

[formula]

We assume now that the functions b(x), f(x) and g(x) satisfy the condition

[formula]

where k1 is an arbitrary constant. Then, by introducing the transformation

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=gen1]) becomes

[formula]

Hence we have obtained the following generalization of the Chiellini Lemma:

Lemma 2. If the coefficients of the general Abel Eq. ([\ref=gen]) satisfy the conditions ([\ref=cond1]) and

[formula]

where k2 is an arbitrary constant, then the Abel equation can be exactly integrated, and its general solution is given by

[formula]

with s(x) a solution of the equation

[formula]

where K0 is an arbitrary constant of integration, and

[formula]

By using Eq. ([\ref=cond1]), Eq. ([\ref=gg]) becomes

[formula]

where [formula] is an arbitrary constant of integration, and [formula], respectively.

A class of exact solutions of the Liénard equation

As we have already seen, the second order non-linear Liénard Eq. ([\ref=1]) can be reduced to an Abel type equation of the form given by Eq. ([\ref=4]), with the general solution given by [formula], where w(x) is determined, as a function of x, by Eq. ([\ref=sol]). Alternatively, Eq. ([\ref=sol]) fixes x as a function of w,

[formula]

To find the time dependence of x, we start from

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

With the use of Eq. ([\ref=6_1]), satisfied by the function w(x), we obtain for dw / dt the equivalent expression,

[formula]

Therefore we have obtained the following:

Theorem. If the coefficients of the Liénard equation ([\ref=1]) satisfy the conditions

[formula]

or

[formula]

where C1, C2 and k are arbitrary constants, then the general solution of the Liénard equation Eq. ([\ref=1]) can be obtained in an exact parametric form, with w taken as a parameter, as

[formula]

with x(w) obtained as a solution of the equation

[formula]

and

[formula]

Similar results were previously obtained in [\cite=Rosu1], where the integral form of the Chiellini integrability condition were explicitly formulated. A particular integrable case of the Liénard equation can be obtained for the case k = 0. In this case, the Chiellini condition given by Eq. ([\ref=5]) immediately provides

[formula]

with A an arbitrary constant. Thus, the Liénard equation takes the particular form

[formula]

with the associated Abel equation given by

[formula]

where [formula]. The general solution of Eq. ([\ref=eqs]) is given by

[formula]

where K1 is an arbitrary constant of integration. Therefore, the general solution of Eq. ([\ref=lies]) can be written in a parametric form, with v taken as a parameter, in the following form

[formula]

where x = x(v) is the solution of Eq. ([\ref=eqa]).

In the general solution for the time, given by Eqs. ([\ref=34]) and ([\ref=42]), one can take the arbitrary integration constant t0 as zero, without any loss of generality. This choice fixes the origin of time at t = 0. The arbitrary integration constant C, as well as the initial value w0 of the parameter w can be determined from the initial conditions at t = 0 for the position x and the velocity [formula], given by

[formula]

where x0 and [formula] are the initial values of x and [formula] at t = 0. By evaluating Eq. ([\ref=solr]) for x = x0, we obtain

[formula]

while evaluating Eq. ([\ref=29]) at t = 0 gives the equation [formula], which determines the initial value of the parameter w0 as

[formula]

Once the initial value of the parameter w0 is known, the value of the integration constant C- 1 is obtained as

[formula]

An integrability condition for the Levinson-Smith equation

The procedure for the exact integration of the Liénard type equations based on the Chiellini Lemma can be easily extended to the generalized Liénard equations of the Levinson-Smith form, given by Eq. ([\ref=lev]), if they can be transformed to an Abel type equation. As a particular case of the integrable Levinson-Smith type non-linear differential equations we consider the equation

[formula]

where γ(x) and δ(x) are some arbitrary functions of the variable x. By denoting [formula], Eq. ([\ref=ls]) takes the form of the general Abel equation

[formula]

If γ(x) = 0, by means of the transformation [formula], Eq. ([\ref=ls1]) can be written in the standard form of the Abel equation,

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula]. If the coefficients A(x) and B(x) of the equation satisfy the conditions of Lemma 1, then the general solution of Eq. ([\ref=abells]) can be obtained through quadratures. If γ(x)  ≠  0, then from Lemma 2 it follows that if the functions γ(x), δ(x), f(x) and g(x) satisfy the conditions

[formula]

where k1 and k2 are two arbitrary constants, then the generalized Liénard type equation ([\ref=ls]) can be integrated exactly. Therefore all the integrability results obtained for the Liénard equation can be applied for the Levinson-Smith type equations of the form ([\ref=ls]).

Examples of exactly integrable Liénard type equations

In the present Section, we consider some exactly integrable Liénard type equations, which represent the generalizations of Eqs. ([\ref=vdp]) and ([\ref=dum]), respectively. As a first case we assume that the functional form of the function f(x) is known. Then the Chiellini integrability condition fixes the form of the function g(x), and allows to find the general solution of the Liénard equation in an exact parametric form. The case in which the function g(x) is fixed is also considered. Furthermore, an integrable generalization of the van der Pol equation is also explored.

First case: f(x) = ax + b.

As a first case we assume that the function f(x) is given by

[formula]

where a and b are arbitrary constants. Then from the first integrability condition, given by Eq. ([\ref=32]) we obtain the function g(x) as

[formula]

where C1 and k are arbitrary integration constants. Therefore the exactly integrable Liénard equation is given by

[formula]

As a function of the parameter w, x is determined by Eq. ([\ref=solr]), which gives for x the quadratic algebraic equation

[formula]

which determines x as a function of w as

[formula]

The time dependence of x is determined as a function of w as

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=50]) and ([\ref=51]) give the exact solution of the Liénard Eq. ([\ref=48]). Depending on the value of the constant k there are three distinct classes of solutions of this equation.

Second case: g(x) = cx + d

Secondly, we consider the case in which the function g(x) is fixed. By analogy with the van der Pol Eq. ([\ref=vdp]), we assume that

[formula]

where c and d are arbitrary constants. Then, after determining the function f(x) from the integrability condition Eq. ([\ref=33]), we obtain the Liénard equation

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=solr]) gives the equation

[formula]

with the solution

[formula]

The parametric time dependence of the solution is obtained as

[formula]

Eqs. ([\ref=55]) and ([\ref=56]) give the exact analytic solution, in a parametric form, of the Liénard Eq. ([\ref=53]).

Third case: the generalization of the van der Pol equation

Finally, we consider the integrable generalization of the van der Pol Eq. ([\ref=vdp]), in which we fix the function f(x) as [formula], and obtain the function g(x) from the integrability condition Eq. ([\ref=32]). Therefore the integrable generalization of the van der Pol equation is given by

[formula]

The parametric dependence of x is determined from the algebraic equation

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=eqc]) can be rewritten in the form

[formula]

where we have denoted

[formula]

The solution of the algebraic Eq. ([\ref=alg]) is given by

[formula]

In order to have a real solution of the cubic Eq. ([\ref=alg]), the conditions

[formula]

and

[formula]

must be satisfied for all w and k.

The parametric time dependence of the solution of the generalized van der Pol equation is obtained as

[formula]

where we have denoted

[formula]

Depending on the numerical values of the parameters k,μ,C1,C a large class of dynamical evolutions of the solutions of the generalized van der Pol equation can be obtained.

Discussions and final remarks

In the present paper we have introduced a class of exactly integrable Liénard, and generalized Liénard type equations. If the coefficients of the second order non-linear equations satisfy some specific conditions, which follow from the Chiellini Lemma, then the general solution of the Liénard differential equation can be obtained in an exact parametric form. As an application of the integrability procedure obtained, we have considered some specific examples of exactly integrable non-linear differential equations that could be of physical interest. One of these equations, Eq. ([\ref=48]) is similar in form with Eq. ([\ref=dum]), and in fact represents the exactly solvable generalization of the equation describing the linearly forced isotropic turbulence [\cite=litm2]. We have also considered an exactly solvable generalization of the classical van der Pol oscillator equation, in which higher order force terms are also present. In all these cases of physical interest the general solution of the corresponding Liénard equation can be obtained in an exact parametric form. The existence of an analytical solution may allow a deeper understanding of the highly non-linear physical processes that govern most of the natural phenomena.

The exact solutions also allow us to obtain some approximate solutions of the considered differential equations, corresponding to the small and large values of the parameter w, respectively. In the limit of small w, i.e., w  ≪  k, giving [formula], Eq. ([\ref=solr]) takes the simple form

[formula]

while the parametric time evolution can be obtained as

[formula]

In the limit of large w, so that w  ≫  k, and w2  ≫  w, [formula], and the approximate asymptotic solution of the exactly integrable Liénard equation is given by

[formula]

and

[formula]

As an application of the previous asymptotic equations we consider the case f(x) = ax + b, with [formula], giving g(x) / f(x) = C1 + kax2 / 2 + kbx.

In the limit of small x, by neglecting the x2 term, we obtain

[formula]

and

[formula]

respectively, giving

[formula]

In the limit of large x, so that kbx  ≫  C1, and ax / 2  ≫  b, respectively, we obtain g(x) / f(x)  ≈  kax2 / 2, and

[formula]

[formula]

In the range of the values of w for which [formula], we obtain

[formula]

where [formula] gives the imaginary error function [formula]. In the large time limit the solution of the Liénard Eq. ([\ref=48]) can be obtained only in a parametric form.
