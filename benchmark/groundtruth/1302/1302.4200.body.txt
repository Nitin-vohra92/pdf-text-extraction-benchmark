Some weak versions of the M1-spaces

Introduction

All spaces are T1 and regular unless stated otherwise, and all maps are continuous and onto. The letter [formula] denotes the set of all positively natural numbers. Let X be a topological space. Recalled that a family P of subsets of X is called closure-preserving if, for any [formula], we have [formula]. Moreover, X is called an M1-space [\cite=CJ] if X has a σ-closure-preserving base. It is still a famous open problem (usually called the M1 = M3 question, see [\cite=Gr1984]) whether each stratifiable space is M1. M. Ito proved that every M3-space with a closure-preserving local base at each point is M1 [\cite=IM], and T. Mizokami has just showed that every M1-space has a closure-preserving local base at each point [\cite=MT]. Therefore, to give a positive answer to M1 = M3, it is sufficient to prove that each stratifiable space has a closure-preserving local base at each point.

R.E. Buck first introduced and studied the mi (see Definition [\ref=d0]) properties in [\cite=BR], where he gave some interesting and surprising results about mi-spaces. Recently, A. Dow, R. Mart[formula]nez and V.V. Tkachuk have also make some study on spaces with a closure-preserving local base at each point (In fact, they call such spaces for Japanese spaces in their paper.) [\cite=DA]. In this paper we introduce some weak versions of M1-spaces, and study some properties and relations on these spaces.

Preliminaries

Let X be a topological space and B a family of subsets of X. B is called a quasi-base [\cite=Gr1984] for X if, for each x and open subset U with x∈U, there exists a B∈B such that x∈(B)  ⊂  B  ⊂  U.

Let X be a topological space and P a pair-family for X, where, for any P∈P, we denote [formula]. P is called a pairbase [\cite=Gr1984] if P satisfies the following conditions:

For any [formula], [formula] and [formula] is open subset of X;

For any x∈U∈τ(X), there exists [formula] such that [formula].

Moreover, a pairbase P is called a cushioned if , for each [formula], we have [formula]

Let P be a collection of subsets of X. P is called closure-preserving [\cite=Gr1984] if, for any [formula], we have [formula].

A family A of open subsets of a space X is called a base of X at a set A if [formula] and for any neighborhood U of A, there is a V∈A such that A  ⊂  V  ⊂  U. A family A of subsets of a space X is called a quasi-base of X at a set A if [formula] and for any neighborhood U of A, there is a V∈A such that A  ⊂  (V)  ⊂  V  ⊂  U.

Let X be a space, x∈X and F a closed subset of X. Then

X is m1 ( σ-m1) at the point x [\cite=BR] if X has a closure-preserving ( σ-closure-preserving) local base at the point x. X is called an m1-space ( σ-m1-space) if every point of X is m1 (σ-m1);

X is s-m1 (s-σ-m1) at F if X has a closure-preserving ( σ-closure-preserving) local base at F. X is called an s-m1-space (s-σ-m1-space) if every closed subset of X is m1 (σ-m1);

X is m2 ( σ-m2) at the point x [\cite=BR] if X has a closure-preserving ( σ-closure-preserving) local quasi-base at the point x. X is called an m2-space ( σ-m2-space) if every point of X is m2 (σ-m2);

X is s-m2 (s-σ-m2) at F if X has a closure-preserving ( σ-closure-preserving) local quasi-base at F. X is called an s-m2-space (s-σ-m2-space) if every closed subset of X is m2 (σ-m2);

X is m3 ( σ-m3) at the point x [\cite=BR] if X has a cushioned local pairbase ( σ-cushioned local pairbase) at the point x. X is called an m3-space ( σ-m3-space) if every point of X is m3 (σ-m3);

X is s-m3 (s-σ-m3) at F if X has a cushioned local pairbase ( σ-cushioned local pairbase) at F. X is called an s-m3-space (s-σ-m3-space) if every closed subset of X is m3 (σ-m3).

It is easy to see that

A space X is called a stratifiable or M3-space if it has a σ-cushioned pairbase. By [\cite=MT], we have that X is M1-space iff X is M3 and m1 iff X is M3 and s-m1. Moreover, if we let X be a regular stratifiable space, then all the spaces on the above are equivalent, see [\cite=BR] [\cite=IM] [\cite=MT].

For each space X, we let I(X) be the set of all isolated points of X. If X is scattered, then let X0 = X; proceeding inductively assume that α is an ordinal and we constructed Xβ for all β  <  α. If α  =  β + 1 for some β, then we let [formula]. If α is a limit ordinal, then we let [formula]. The first ordinal α such that [formula] is called the dispersion index of X and is denoted by i(X), see [\cite=DA].

s-m1 and s-σ-m1 spaces

In [\cite=DA], A. Dow, R. Mart[formula]nez and V.V. Tkachuk proved that each space with a finite number of non-isolated points is an m1-space, and each compact scattered space X and i(X)  ≤  3 is an m1-space. However, we shall see that there exists an m1-space X such that X is non-s-m1, see Example [\ref=e0]. But we have the follow Theorems [\ref=t0] and [\ref=t3], which extend the results of the above.

Let P be a topological property such that (a) if space X has P then X has mi and (b) if X has P and A is a closed subspace then X / A has P. Then every space X with property P has the s-variant property s-mi.

Take any space X with property P, and take any closed subset A of X. Then, by (b), X / A has property P, and so is mi (by (a)). In particular, the point A in X / A is an mi point, and so the set A has a 'nice' outer base in X. From which it follows that X has s-mi.

Each space with a finite number of non-isolated points is an s-m1-space.

Let X be a space with a finite number of non-isolated points, and let A be a closed subspace of X. It is easy to see that X / A has finite number of non-isolated points. By [\cite=DA], a space with a finite number of non-isolated points is mi, and thus X is an s-m1-space by Lemma [\ref=l1].

If X is a compact scattered space and i(X)  ≤  3, then X is an s-m1-space.

Let X be a compact scattered space and i(X)  ≤  3, and let A be a closed subspace of X. It is easy to see that X / A is also a compact scattered space and i(X)  ≤  3. By [\cite=DA], a compact scattered space and i(X)  ≤  3 is mi, and thus X is an s-m1-space by Lemma [\ref=l1].

The proofs of the following Propositions [\ref=p0],  [\ref=p1] and [\ref=p2] are easy, and so we omit them.

If X has a clopen closure-preserving neighborhood base at any closed set then X is hereditarily s-m1. In particular, any extremally disconnected s-m1 space is hereditarily s-m1.

Suppose that X is a space and a closed set F  ⊂  X has an open neighborhood base in X which is well-ordered by the reverse inclusion. Then X is s-m1 at F.

If X is an s-m1-space, and D is dense in X. Then D is also an s-m1-subspace.

A map f:X  →  Y is called quasi-open if, for each non-empty open subset U of X, the interior of f(U) is non-empty. f is called an irreducible map if, for each proper closed subset F of X, we have f(F)  ≠  Y.

[\cite=GG] Let f:X  →  Y be a quasi-open closed map. If [formula] is a closure-preserving open family of X, then [formula] is a closure-preserving open family of Y.

Let f:X  →  Y be a quasi-open closed map. If X is an s-m1-space, then Y is also an s-m1 space.

Let F be any closed set of Y and F  ≠  Y. Then f- 1(F) is closed in X. Since X is s-m1, f- 1(F) has a closure-preserving open neighborhood base [formula] at f- 1(F). Since f is a quasi-open closed map, the family [formula] is a closure-preserving open family of Y by Lemma [\ref=l0]. Moreover, because f is a closed map, we have F  ⊂  (f(B)) for each [formula]. It is easy to see that φ is an open neighborhood base at F in Y.

Closed and irreducible maps preserve s-m1-spaces.

Since closed and irreducible maps are quasi-open maps[\cite=GG], closed and irreducible maps preserve s-m1 property by Theorem [\ref=t1].

Next, we shall give an example to show that there exists an m1-space X which is non-s-m1. Firstly, we prove the following Theorem [\ref=t2].

Let A be a subset of a space X. We call a family N of open subsets of X is an outer base of A in X if for any x∈A and open subset U with x∈U there is a V∈N such that x∈V  ⊂  U.

If X is Eberlein compact then X is an s-σ-m1-space.

Let F be any closed subset of X. Since X is Eberlein compact, it follows from [\cite=DA] that F has a σ-closure-preserving outer base [formula] in X, where, for each [formula], [formula] is closure-preserving and [formula] For each [formula], let

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] is a σ-closure-preserving local base at the set F in X, where, for each [formula], [formula] is closure-preserving.

Recalled that a closed map f:X  →  Y which is perfect if, for each y∈Y, f- 1(y) is compact.

There exists an m1-space X such that the following conditions are satisfied:

X is an s-σ-m1-space, and non-s-m1-space;

The image of X under some perfect and irreducible map is not an m1-space.

Let X be the Alexandroff double D of the Cantor set C. Then X is first countable Elberlein compact space [\cite=DA]. Hence X is s-σ-m1 by Theorem [\ref=t2]. Let f:X  →  Y be the quotient map by identifying the non-isolated point of X to one point. Then f is an irreducible and perfect map. However, Y is not an m1-space by [\cite=DA], and hence X is a not an s-m1-space by Corollary [\ref=c0]. Moreover, it is easy to see that first-countable spaces are m1. However, X is non-s-m1-space. Therefore, compact first-countable is not need to be an s-m1-space.

In [\cite=DA], the authors prove that each GO space is m1. However, we don't know whether each GO space is s-m1, and so we have the following question.

Let X be a GO space. Is X s-m1?

s-m2 and s-σ-m2 spaces

Since closed maps preserve a closure-preserving family, we have the following theorem.

Closed maps preserve s-m2 and s-σ-m2 spaces, respectively.

If X is an s-m2-space and Y  ⊂  X then Y is s-m2.

A space X is monotonically normal if there is a function G which assigns to each closed ordered pair (H,K) of disjoint closed subsets of X an open subset G(H,K)  ⊂  X such that:

(1) [formula];

(2) [formula] for disjoint closed subsets [formula] and [formula] with [formula] and [formula];

(3) [formula];

Moreover, if X also satisfies the following condition

(4) if [formula] with [formula] closed in X, then [formula]. Then X is called strongly monotonically normal [\cite=HR] [\cite=HR1].

In [\cite=DA], the authors pose the following question.

[\cite=DA] Must every monotonically normal space be an m1-space?

Next, we shall give some partial answer for this Question [\ref=q0], see Theorem [\ref=t5].

Let X be a strongly monotonically normal space. Then X is an s-m2-space.

Let A be a closed subspace of X. In [\cite=BR1], R.E. Buck, R.W. Heath and P.L. Zenora showed that a closed image of a strongly monotonically normal space is again strongly monotonically normal, and hence X / A is strongly monotonically normal. By [\cite=BR], a strongly monotonically normal space is m2, and thus X is an s-m2-space by Lemma [\ref=l1].

Let X be a strongly monotonically normal space. Is X an s-m1-space or an m1-space?

s-m3 and σ-m3 spaces

The proofs of the following two theorems are obvious, and so we omit them.

Closed maps preserve s-m3 and s-σ-m3-spaces, respectively.

If X is an s-m3-space and Y  ⊂  X then Y is s-m3.

The following theorem is also a partial answer for the Question [\ref=q0].

Let X be a monotonically normal space. Then X is an s-m3-space.

Let A be a closed subspace of X. It is well known that monotonically normal spaces are preserved by closed images, and implies m3. Hence X is m3 and X / A is monotonically normal, which follows that X is an s-m3-space by Lemma [\ref=l1].

Let X be a space and κ an infinite cardinal. For each x∈X, we denote t(x,X) means that for any A  ⊂  X with [formula] there exists a set B  ⊂  A such that |B|  ≤  κ and [formula]; moreover, t(X)  ≤  κ iff t(x,X)  ≤  κ for each x∈X. The space X with t(X)  ≤  κ are said to have tightness ≤  κ.

A pairwise disjoint collection of non-empty open subsets in X is called a cellular family. The cellularity of X, defined as follows:

[formula]

In [\cite=CP], P.M. Gartside proved that for each monotonically normal space X, we have t(X)  ≤  c(X). We shall extend this result of P.M. Gartside, and prove that, for each σ-m3-space X, we have t(X)  ≤  c(X).

Suppose that a space X is σ-m3 at some point x∈X and κ is an infinite cardinal such that c(U)  ≤  κ for some open neighborhood U of the point x. Then t(x,X)  ≤  κ. In particular, if X is an σ-m3-space, then t(X)  ≤  c(X).

Fix any set [formula] with [formula]. Let [formula] be a σ-cushioned pairbase at the point x, where [formula] for each [formula], and for each [formula] is closed in X. Without loss of generality, we may assume that A  ⊂  U and [formula]. For each [formula] and [formula], put

[formula]

For each [formula], since [formula], Wny is an open neighborhood of y.

Claim 1: If [formula], then [formula] if and only if, for each [formula], [formula].

In fact, if [formula], then, for each open neighborhood V of point x, we have [formula]. Choose a point [formula]. It follows that [formula] for each [formula], and hence we have [formula]. For each [formula], let [formula]. Suppose that [formula]. Then there exist an [formula] and [formula] such that x∈P1 and [formula]. For each y∈Q, since [formula], we have [formula], and so [formula], which is a contradiction.

For each [formula] and y∈A, put [formula]. It follows from c(U)  ≤  κ that we can choose a set Dn  ⊂  A such that |Dn|  ≤  κ and [formula] is dense in [formula]. Let [formula]. Then |D|  ≤  κ. Obviously, we have that

[formula]

which implies that [formula] for each [formula]. By the Claim 1, we have [formula]. Therefore, t(x,X)  ≤  κ.

[\cite=DA] If X is an m2-space, then t(X)  ≤  c(X).

[\cite=CP] If X is a monotonically normal space, then t(X)  ≤  c(X).

Recall that a family U of non-empty open sets of a space X is called a π-base if for each non-empty open set V of X, there exists an U∈U such that V  ⊂  U. The π-character of x in X is defined by πχ(x,X) = {|U|:U  π x  X}. The π-character of X is defined by πχ(X) = {πχ(x,X):x∈X}.

In [\cite=DA], A. Dow, R. Ram[formula]rez and V.V. Tkachuk proved that if X is a separable m2-space with the Baire property then X has countable π-character. However, we find the proof has a gap. Next, we shall give out the correct proof. In fact, we have more general result, see Theorem [\ref=t6].

Suppose that a space X is a separable space with the Baire property. If X is σ-m3 at some point x∈X, then it has countable π-character at the point x.

Suppose that x is a non-isolated point in X, and that [formula] is a dense subset of X. Let [formula] be a σ-cushioned pairbase at the point x, where, for each [formula], [formula] is cushioned. For each [formula], put [formula]. For each [formula] and [formula], put

[formula]

Then Wny is an open neighborhood of y. For each [formula], put [formula]. It is easy to see that [formula] Further, for each [formula], Bn,m is closed in [formula]. In fact, let [formula]. Then y∈Wny, and hence [formula]. For each [formula], we have Wnz  ⊂  Wny, and thus dn,m∈Wnz  ⊂  Wny. So y∈Bn,m. Let [formula] Then [formula] is a countable π-base at the point x.

In fact, let any open subset U with x∈U. Since [formula] is a local pairbase at the point x, there exist an [formula] and [formula] such that x∈P1  ⊂  P2  ⊂  U, where P = (P1,P2). It is easy to see that, for each [formula], dn,m∈Bn,m  ⊂  P2 whenever dn,m∈P1. Let [formula]. Then V is a non-empty open subset and has the Baire property. If y∈V, then [formula], and hence there exists an [formula] such that [formula], i.e., y∈Bn,m. Therefore, [formula]. Since V has the Baire property, there exists an [formula] such that [formula]. Hence [formula] and G  ⊂  Bn,m  ⊂  P2  ⊂  U. Therefore, [formula] is a countable π-base at the point x.

[\cite=DA] Suppose that a space X is a separable space with the Baire property and X is m2 at some point x∈X. Then X has countable π-character at the point x.

If G is a separable σ-m3-group with the Baire property then G is metrizable.

Since w(G) = πw(G) for any topological group, G is metrizable.
