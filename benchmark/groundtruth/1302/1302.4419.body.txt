Introduction

The original motivation of the Malliavin calculus was to study the existence and the regularity of the densities of random variables. In this research direction, the determinant of the so-callled Malliavin matrix plays a crucial role.

We give here an explicit formula that connects the determinant of the Malliavin matrix and the determinant of the covariance matrix of a couple of multiple stochastic integrals. This is related to two open problems stated in [\cite=NoNuPo]. In this reference, the authors showed that, if F = (F1,..,Fd) is a random vector whose components belong to a finite sum of Wiener chaoses, then the law of F is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesque measure if and only if E det Λ = 0. Here Λ denotes the Malliavin matrix of the vector F. In particular, they proved that a couple of multiple integrals of order 2 either admits a density or its components are proportional.

They stated two open questions (Questions 6.1 and 6.2 in [\cite=NoNuPo], arXiv version): if C is the covariance matrix and Λ the Malliavin matrix of a vector of multiple stochastic integrals,

We make a first step in order to answer to these two open problems. Actually, we find an explicit relation that connects the two determinants. In particular, if the multiple integrals are of the same order and this order is at most 4, we prove that two random variables in the same Wiener chaos either admit a joint density, either are proportional. The basic idea is to write the Malliavin matrix as a sum of squares and to compute the dominant term of its determinant.

We organized our paper as follows. Section 2 contains some preliminaries on analysis on Wiener chaos. Section 3 is devoted to express the Malliavin matrix as the sum of the squares of some random variables and in Section 4 we derive an explicit formula for the determinant of Λ which also involves the determinant of the covariance matrix. In Section 5 we discuss the existence of the joint density of a vector of multiple integrals.

Preliminaries

We briefly describe the tools from the analysis on Wiener space that we will need in our work. For complete presentations, we refer to [\cite=N] or [\cite=NPbook]. Let H be a real and separable Hilbert space and consider (W(h),h∈H) an isonormal process. That is, (W(h),h∈H) is a family of centered Gaussian random variables on the probability space (Ω,F,P) such that EW(h)W(g) = 〈f,g〉H for every h,g∈H. Assume that the σ-algebra F is generated by W.

Denote, for n  ≥  0, by Hn the nth Wiener chaos generated by W. That is, Hn is the vector subspace of L2(Ω) generated by [formula] where Hn the Hermite polynomial of degree n. For any n  ≥  1, the mapping [formula] can be extended to an isometry between the Hilbert space [formula] endowed with the norm [formula] and the nth Wiener chaos Hn. The random variable In(f) is called the multiple Wiener Itô integral of f with respect to W.

Consider (ej)j  ≥  1 a complete orthonormal system in H and let [formula], [formula] be two symmetric functions with n,m  ≥  1. Then

and

[formula]

where the coefficients λi and βj satisfy λjσ(1),...jσ(n)  =  λj1,..,jn and βkπ(1),...,kπ(m)  =  βk1,..,km for every permutation σ of the set {1,...,n} and for every permutation π of the set {1,..,m}. Actually [formula] and [formula] in ([\ref=f]) and ([\ref=g]). Note that, throughout the paper we will use the notation 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 to indicate the scalar product in [formula], independently of k.

If [formula], [formula] are symmetric given by ([\ref=f]), ([\ref=g]) respectively, then the contraction of order r of F and g is given by

[formula]

for every [formula]. In particular [formula]. Note that [formula] belongs to [formula] for every [formula] and it is not in general symmetric. We will denote by frg the symmetrization of [formula]. In the particular case when H = L2(T,B,μ) where μ is a sigma-finite measure without atoms, ([\ref=contra]) becomes

[formula]

An important role will be played by the following product formula for multiple Wiener-Itô integrals: if [formula], [formula] are symmetric, then

[formula]

We will need the concept of Malliavin derivative D with respect to W, but we will use only its action on Wiener chaos. In order to avoid too many details, we will just say that, if f is given by ([\ref=f]) and In(f) denotes its multiple integral of order n with respect to W, then If F,G are two random variables which are differentiable in the Malliavin sense, we will denote throughout the paper by C the covariance matrix and by Λ the Malliavin matrix of the random vector (F,G). That is,

[formula]

The Malliavin matrix as a sum of squares

In this section we will express the determinant of the Malliavin matrix of a random couple as a sum of squares of certain random variables. This will be useful in order to derive the exact formula for the determinant of the Malliavin matrix and its connection with the determinant of the covariance matrix for a given random vector of dimension 2.

Let [formula] and [formula] be given by ([\ref=f]) and ([\ref=g]) respectively, with n,m  ≥  1. Let F = In(f),G = Im(g) denote the multiple Wiener-Itô integrals of f and g with respect to W respectively. Then

[formula]

and

[formula]

From ([\ref=if]) and ([\ref=ig]) we have and This implies and and Let us make the following notation. For every i  ≥  1, let

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can write and

[formula]

A key observation is that

[formula]

We obtained

The determinant of the Malliavin matrix Λ of the vector (F,G) = (In(f),Im(g)) can be expressed as where Si,f,Si,g are given by ([\ref=sif]) and ([\ref=sig]) respectively.

The determinant of the Malliavin matrix Λ of the vector (F,G) = (In(f),Im(g)) can be expressed as Proof: This comes from Proposition [\ref=t1] and the relations for every i  ≥  1. height.25cm depth0cm

The determinant of the Malliavin matrix on Wiener chaos

Fix n,m  ≥  1 and f,g in [formula] respectively defined by ([\ref=f]) and ([\ref=g]). Consider the random vector (F,G) = (In(f),Im(g)) and denote by Λ its Malliavin matrix and by C its covariance matrix.

Let us compute E det Λ. Denote, for every i,l  ≥  1

[formula]

and

[formula]

Clearly, for every i,l  ≥  1

[formula]

The following lemma plays a key role in our construction.

If [formula] and [formula] are given by ([\ref=f]) and ([\ref=g]) respectively and si,f,si,g by ([\ref=sf]), ([\ref=sg]) respectively, then for every r = 0,..,n - 1

Proof: Consider first r = 0. Clearly, by ([\ref=contra])

[formula]

The same argument applies for every r = 1,..,n - 1. Indeed,

[formula]

and by ([\ref=contra]) again

We make a first step to compute E det Λ.

Let [formula] be symmetric and denote by Λ the Malliavin matrix of the vector (F,G) = (In(f),Im(g)). Then we have where we denote, for [formula],

[formula]

and si,f,si,g are given by ([\ref=sf]), ([\ref=sg]) for i  ≥  1.

Proof: By Proposition [\ref=t1] and relation ([\ref=x1])

[formula]

where we used the the product formula ([\ref=prod]). Consequently, from the isometry of multiple stochastic integrals,

[formula]

height.25cm depth0cm

For every [formula] let us denote by

[formula]

Obviously all the terms Tk above are positive, for [formula].

We will need two more auxiliary lemmas.

Assume [formula] and [formula] are symmetric functions. Then for every [formula] we have

Proof: The case r = 0 is trivial, so assume r  ≥  1. Without any loss of the generality, assume that H is L2(T;μ) where μ is a sigma-finite measure without atoms. Then, by ([\ref=contra2])

[formula]

height.25cm depth0cm

Suppose [formula] are symmetric functions. Then

Proof: This has been stated and proven in [\cite=NoRo] in the case m = n. Exactly the same lines of the proofs apply for [formula]. height.25cm depth0cm

We first compute the term T0 obtained for k = 0 in ([\ref=tk]).

Let T0 be given by ([\ref=tk]) with k = 0.

[formula]

Proof: From ([\ref=tk]),

[formula]

Let us apply Lemma [\ref=l1] to compute these norms and scalar products. We obtain, by letting f1  =  si,f  =  f4 and f2  =  sl,g  =  f3 (note that si,f,si,g are symmetric functions in [formula] respectively)

[formula]

Analogously, for f1  =  sl,f = f4 and f2  =  si,g = f3 in Lemma [\ref=l1] we get

[formula]

Next, with f1  =  si,f,f2  =  sl,g,f4  =  sl,f,f3  =  si,g

[formula]

Then

[formula]

Notice that, by Lemma [\ref=l5], for every r = 0,..,n - 1

[formula]

We apply now Lemma [\ref=l3] and we get

[formula]

and by Lemma [\ref=l5] and Lemma [\ref=l3], this equals

[formula]

By replacing ([\ref=u1]) and ([\ref=u2]) in ([\ref=u3]) we obtain

[formula]

height.25cm depth0cm

As a consequence of the above proof, we obtain

For every [formula] and if si,f,si,g are given by ([\ref=sf]), ([\ref=sg]), it holds that As a consequence, for every [formula] we have

[formula]

Proof: It is a consequence of the proof of Proposition [\ref=pt0]. height.25cm depth0cm

Let us state the main results of this section.

Let [formula](n,m  ≥  1) be symmetric and denote by Λ the Malliavin matrix of the vector (F,G) = (In(f),Im(g)). Then where for every n,m  ≥  1, Rn,m is given by ([\ref=rnm]). Note that Rn,m  ≥  0 for every n,m  ≥  1.

Proof: It follows from Proposition [\ref=pt0] and Lemma [\ref=l7]. height.25cm depth0cm

In the case when the two multiple integrals live in the same Wiener chaos, we have a nicer expression.

Under the same assumptions as in Theorem [\ref=t3] but with m = n, we have with Rm given by ([\ref=rnm]). Here

[formula]

Proof: Suppose n  ≤  m and that m is odd. The case m even is similar. From Theorem [\ref=t3] we have

[formula]

where we made the change of index r' = n - 1 - r in the second and third sum above. Finally, noticing that for r = 0 we have

[formula]

we obtain the conclusion. height.25cm depth0cm

Suppose m = n = 2. Then

[formula]

We retrieve the formula in [\cite=NoNuPo] with [formula]

Assume m = n = 3. Then

[formula]

Suppose m = n = 4. Then

[formula]

Densities of vectors of multiple integrals

Let us discuss when a couple of multiple stochastic integrals has a law which is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesque measure. The situations when the components of the vector are in the same chaos of in chaoses of different orders need to be separated.

Let us first discuss the case of variables in the same chaos. In order better understand the relation between det Λ and det C we need more information on the terms Rm in Theorem [\ref=t2]. It is actually possible to compute the last term Tm - 1 in ([\ref=tk]).

Suppose m = n and let Tm - 1 be the term obtained in ([\ref=tk]) for r = m - 1. Then

Proof: From ([\ref=tk]),

[formula]

where we applied Lemmas [\ref=l3] and [\ref=l5]. height.25cm depth0cm.

We first answer the open problem 6.2 in [\cite=NoNuPo] for chaoses of order lesser than five.

Let m  ≤  4 and let [formula] be symmetric. Then the random vector (F,G) = (Im(f),Im(g)) does not admit a density if and only if

[formula]

In other words, the vector (F,G) does not admit a density if and only if its components are proportional.

Proof: The case m = n = 1 is obvious and the case m = n = 2 follows from [\cite=NoNuPo] (it also follows from Example [\ref=exx]). Suppose m = n = 3. Then

[formula]

where R3' is the term with k = 1 in ([\ref=tk]). Using [formula] (Lemma [\ref=l3]) we get

[formula]

Suppose det Λ = 0. Then T0,T1,T2 from ([\ref=tk]) vanish. In particular T2 = 0 in ([\ref=tk]) and so

[formula]

This implies

[formula]

and therefore det C = 0 because [formula] is positive by Cauchy-Schwarz.

Suppose m = n = 4.

[formula]

where R4' is the sum of terms obtained for k = 1 and k = 2 in ([\ref=tk]). Since [formula](Lemma [\ref=l3]) we get

[formula]

Assume det Λ = 0. Then in particular T3 from {[\ref=tk]) vanishes. So

[formula]

and this implies det C = 0.

For m = n  ≥  5, we have

[formula]

If det Λ = 0 then, since T4 vanishes, we get that [formula] vanishes. But this is not enough. We need some additional information in order to handle the difference [formula]. One possibility is to look to the terms T1,T2,T3 in ([\ref=tk]) but these terms cannot be written in a closed form, since they involve more complicated contractions (some "contractions of contractions").

Let us finish by some comments concerning the case of variables in chaoses of different orders. Consider (F,G) = (In(f),Im(g)) with [formula]. First, let us note that E det Λ = 0 does not imply det C = 0. This can be viewed by considering the following example.

Take F = I2(f) and [formula] where ||h|| = 1. In this case

[formula]

One can also choose [formula] and [formula] with [formula] and ||h|| = 1.

In the case (In(f),I1(g)) there is only one term in ([\ref=tk]) obtained for k = 0. It reads and therefore the condition for the existence of the joint density is [formula].

The case (In(f),I2(g)) is more complicated and needs new ideas in order to obtain the if and only if condition for the existence of the density of the vector. Even the "last term"in ([\ref=tk]) (that is, the term obtained for [formula] cannot be written is a nice form.
