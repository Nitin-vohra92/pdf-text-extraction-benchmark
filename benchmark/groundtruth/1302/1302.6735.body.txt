Locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operators

Introduction

Let A be a unital complex algebra. In order to gain information on the range of a linear mapping φ:A  →  A one can impose conditions on the size of the spectrum of the elements φ(x), x∈A. Various classes of linear mappings such as (inner) derivations or generalised (inner) derivations with small spectrum in the range, especially when the spectrum of every element in the range consists only of zero, have been studied by Aupetit, Bre sar, Le Page, Pták, Semrl, the present authors and many others; see, e.g., [\cite=Aup] [\cite=ChKeLee] [\cite=NaMa04] [\cite=NaMa11] [\cite=Pta] and the references contained therein. Quite often such results are connected with commutativity criteria; see, e.g., [\cite=Aup].

An attractive and fairly large class of linear mappings are the elementary operators, that is, those which can be written as [formula], x∈A. In this paper we intend, on the one hand, to extend various results that were available only for special elementary operators, for instance, for generalised inner derivations x  ↦  ax - xb, to general elementary operators; on the other hand, we want to uncover the algebraic structure behind arguments which were at times used in an analytic setting.

Clearly, every elementary operator leaves each ideal of A invariant and thus induces an elementary operator on each primitive quotient of A. As the typical phenomena already appear for dense algebras of linear mappings on a complex vector space, we focus our attention solely on this case here. The general case then is mainly a question of putting the information from primitive quotients together to a global picture which can, e.g., be done with the aid of the extended centroid of a semisimple algebra A.

In the setting of a dense algebra A of linear mappings on a vector space X, it turns out that the local dimension of [formula] plays an important role in such descriptions. In the case where [formula] is locally linearly independent, we will determine the maximal local dimension of [formula], and we shall give a complete characterization if the local dimension is maximal. Our arguments depend heavily on Gerstenhaber's well-known theorem concerning linear spaces of nilpotent matrices [\cite=Ger]. Lacking a general description of maximal nilpotent spaces, and since the classification of minimal locally linearly dependent spaces is a highly non-trivial matter [\cite=BrSe] [\cite=MeSe], we will, in the last part of the paper (Section [\ref=sect:length-three]), have to limit ourselves to elementary operators of length at most three.

The main idea in our approach is as follows. Starting with a locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operator φ (that is, the spectrum of φ(x) is the singleton 0 for every x∈A), we aim to find finite-dimensional φ(x)-invariant subspaces L  ⊆  X, for certain x, so that φ(x)|L will be nilpotent. If the dimension of L is large relative to the local dimension of [formula], we will get full information on how to represent φ with suitable coefficients. The details of this approach will be explained at the start of Sections [\ref=sect:locally-nil] and [\ref=sect:length-three].

In a sequel to this paper, we shall apply our results to the study of spectrally bounded elementary operators on Banach algebras continuing the line of research in [\cite=CuMa] and [\cite=NaMa11], for example.

Preliminaries

Let X,Y be two complex vector spaces. The space of all linear mappings from X to Y will be designated by L(X,Y), and L(X) stands for the algebra L(X,X). Throughout this paper, A will denote a dense algebra (in the sense of Jacobson) of linear mappings on X.

Though not quite standard, we will use the term elementary operator for every linear mapping φ:A  →  L(X) that can be written in the form

[formula]

for some ai,  bi∈L(X) and some [formula]. Special cases are La:x  ↦  ax, Rb:x  ↦  xb and Ma,b = LaRb. Clearly the representation of φ in a sum as in [\eqref=eq:elop-def] is not unique; but it is well known that, in our setting, whenever we change the coefficients ai, bi to new ones ui, vi (and possibly the n to some m) we obtain [formula] and [formula]. The smallest [formula] such that the elementary operator φ can be written as [formula] is called the length of φ   and will be abbreviated as [formula]. If [formula] and [formula] then, evidently, the sets [formula] and [formula] are linearly independent. Moreover, if [formula], there exists an invertible matrix [formula] such that

[formula]

We will denote by [formula] and [formula], respectively the set of all elementary operators from A to L(X) and the set of all elementary operators of length n, respectively. If [formula], we define a new elementary operator φ* by [formula].

We shall use the following notation for [formula]:

A linear mapping y∈L(X) is said to be quasi-nilpotent if λ - y is bijective for each [formula] and y itself is not bijective. We shall call [formula] locally quasi-nilpotent if φ(x) is quasi-nilpotent for every x∈A.

For a finite-dimensional subspace V of L(X,Y), let [formula] denote the local dimension of V, cf. [\cite=LiPa]. Recall that V (or, equivalently, a basis of V) is said to be locally linearly dependent if [formula]. For background on these notions, the reader is referred to [\cite=BrSe] [\cite=MeSe]. In the case that [formula], any vector satisfying [formula] is called a separating vector of V.

Spaces of matrices with bounded rank have been extensively studied by many authors, see, e.g., [\cite=AtLl], and their classification is still a challenging problem. The connection with locally linearly dependent spaces is given by the following lemma the proof of which is straightforward and hence omitted.

Let X,Y be complex vector spaces, and let V be a finite-dimensional subspace of L(X,Y). Suppose that [formula] and set X̂  =  {:ζ∈X}, where :V  →  Y is defined by ζ(T) = Tζ for all T∈V. Then X̂ is a subspace of L(V,Y) of rank at most r.

Let F(X) denote the ideal of L(X) consisting of those linear mappings with finite-dimensional range and let X* be the space of all linear functionals on X. For a vector ξ∈X and a linear functional f∈X*, let [formula] denote the mapping [formula], η∈X.

The first of the next two auxiliary results is standard while the second follows from [\cite=BrSe]; see also [\cite=GoLaWo].

Let [formula]. Suppose that [formula] is a basis of L(φ). Then there exists a basis [formula] of R(φ) such that [formula].

Let X be a vector space and let [formula] be finite-dimensional subspaces of L(X). Then there exists ζ∈X such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  k.

Let [formula], where φi:A  →  L(X) are linear mappings satisfying φj(x)φi(y) = 0 for all j  ≥  i and x,y∈A. Then [formula] for all [formula].

We proceed by induction on n. The case n = 1 is trivial. Assume that n > 1 and the desired conclusion holds for n - 1. Since φn(x)φi(y) = 0 for all i and all x,y∈A, we have for each n, and analogously for all r and [formula], The induction hypothesis implies that [formula]. Thus Consequently, [formula].

The following consequence of the above proposition explains a local nilpotency property of elementary operators and is in part the motivation for our main result in Section [\ref=sect:length-three] of this paper.

Let [formula]. Suppose that biaj = 0 for all i  ≥  j. Then (φ(x))n + 1 = 0 for all x∈A.

Locally nilpotent elementary operators

The purpose of this section is to find necessary conditions for local nilpotency of an elementary operator.

Let [formula] be an elementary operator on A of length n, where ai,bi∈L(X). Let ζ∈X and x∈A be such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let [formula], π(ζ) = 1 denote the canonical map. Suppose moreover [formula] is linearly independent; in such a situation, we shall abbreviate this set to [formula], if convenient. Let [formula] be the corresponding matrix representation of φ(x) with respect to [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let [formula] be an elementary operator. Suppose that for every ζ∈X and x∈A such that [formula], φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent. Then [formula].

Suppose that there exist ζ∈X and [formula] such that bjajζ  ≠  0. Set [formula]. Rearranging the order of the ai's, if necessary, we may assume that [formula] is linearly independent. For t > s we can thus write [formula] with unique [formula], s < t  ≤  n. Replacing the coefficients at, t > s by

[formula]

it is clear that atζ = 0 for t > s. As it is easily verified that

[formula]

we can write φ in this new representation assuming these two additional properties of the coefficients ai. (This argument will be used repeatedly in the sequel.)

Choose [formula] such that [formula] is linearly independent, r being maximal. Fix [formula]. Choose x∈A such that

[formula]

Let [formula]. Write [formula] for all i∈J. Then xbiaiζ  =  αijζ for all i∈J. Moreover, where [formula] denotes the trace. By our hypothesis, we must have [formula]. Consequently, Thus

[formula]

As a result, [formula].

Since this entails that [formula] for every ζ∈X, [formula] as desired.

Let [formula] be an elementary operator such that [formula]. Set [formula] and suppose that for every ζ∈X and x∈A such that [formula], φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent. Then φ admits a representation of the form [formula] with

[formula]

where T is a strictly upper triangular matrix of order r. Moreover, φ*φ = 0 and (φ(x))r + 2 = 0 for all x∈A.

Write [formula]. It follows from Lemma [\ref=free] that there exists ζ∈X such that [formula] and [formula]. As in the proof of Proposition [\ref=trace-qu], we can suppose that [formula] is linearly independent and that akζ = 0 for every k > r. It then follows from our assumption on V(φ) that R(φ)ak = 0 for all k > r. Let [formula] be such that bsat  ≠  0. Then [formula]. Pick x∈A with the property that xbsatζ  =  ζ. Then [formula] and we have

[formula]

Choose a basis [formula] of L(φ)ζ such that [formula] is upper triangular. Write [formula]. Replacing ui by [formula], if necessary, we have [formula]. For k > r, set uk  =  ak and write [formula] for some suitable [formula]. It is clear that the matrix (viuj) has the desired form. Next observe that φ is the sum of two elementary operators φ1, φ2, such that [formula], [formula] and R(φ)L(φ2) = 0. Therefore

[formula]

It is now easy to get the final assertion.

The main result of this section gives a description of locally nilpotent elementary operators where the coefficient spaces have maximal local dimension.

Let [formula] be an elementary operator of length n such that [formula]. Suppose that for every ζ∈X and x∈A such that [formula], φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent. Then [formula]. Moreover, if [formula], then φ admits a representation of the form [formula], where viuj = 0 for every i  ≥  j. In particular, [formula].

Write [formula], set [formula] and choose ζ∈X such that [formula] and [formula] (Lemma [\ref=free]). Let {bitajtζ}1  ≤  t  ≤  r be a basis of V(φ)ζ. Pick [formula] with xkbitajtζ  =  δktζ, for each 1  ≤  t,k  ≤  r. Let N be the vector subspace of [formula] generated by [formula]. Then N is nilpotent and [formula]. Applying Gerstenhaber's theorem on maximal spaces of nilpotent matrices [\cite=Ger], we infer that [formula] and if [formula], there exists a basis B of L(φ)ζ such that M(φ(x),B) is upper triangular for each [formula]. Next suppose that [formula] and set [formula]. Then [formula]. Applying Lemma [\ref=form], we get the existence of a basis [formula] of R(φ) such that [formula]. Since M(φ(x),B) = (π(xviujζ))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, we have π(xviujζ) = 0 for all i  ≥  j and [formula], thus viujζ = 0 for all i  ≥  j. Since [formula], the set {viujζ:i < j} is a basis of V(φ)ζ.

Next we shall show by induction on n that [formula]. The case n = 1 is trivial. Suppose that the desired result is true for elementary operators of length n - 1, n > 1. We first claim that R(φ)u1  =  0. To prove the claim suppose that there exists ζ'∈X such that R(φ)u1ζ'  ≠  0. Let i1 be maximal (among [formula]) such that vi1u1ζ'  ≠  0. It is clear that i1 > 1. Let i2 be maximal such that {vi1u1ζ',vi2u1ζ'} is linearly independent. If i2  <  t < i1, replace vt by v't  =  vt  -  αvi1 and ui1 by u'i1  =  ui1  +  αut such that v'tu1ζ' = 0. We recursively find [formula] and define u'i,v'i such that u'1 = u1, [formula], v'ju'iζ = 0 for all j  ≥  i, the sets {v'iu'jζ:i < j} and [formula] are linearly independent and if [formula], v'tu'1ζ' = 0. Choose a non-zero scalar λ such that {v'iu'j(ζ  +  λζ'):i < j} is linearly independent. Replacing ζ' by ζ  +  λζ' if needed, we may assume with no loss of generality that {v'iu'jζ':i < j} is linearly independent. Thus, by the above argument, there exists c1∈L(φ) such that R(φ)c1ζ' = 0. In particular, [formula]. Write [formula]. Since v'1c1ζ' = 0 and [formula] is linearly independent, we infer that β1v'1u'1ζ'  ≠  0. Consequently, ir = 1. We get a contradiction by choosing x∈A such that xv'itu'1ζ' = 0 for [formula] and xv'1u'1ζ' = ζ' (indeed, we have φ(x)u'1ζ' = u'1ζ'). The claim is proved. Now set [formula]. Then for every x∈A and ζ'∈X such that [formula], the restriction of ψ(x) to L(ψ)ζ' must be nilpotent; otherwise, there exists y∈A such that [formula] and y|V(ψ)ζ'  =  x|V(ψ)ζ' such that φ(y)|V(φ)ζ' is not nilpotent. Our induction hypothesis yields the desired result.

Let [formula] be an elementary operator of length n such that [formula] and [formula]. Suppose that for every ζ∈X and x∈A such that [formula], φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent. Then [formula]. Moreover, if [formula], then φ admits a representation of the form [formula] where viuj = 0 for every i  ≥  j.

Choose i,j such that biaj  ≠  0. The case [formula] follows from Proposition [\ref=dimV=1], so suppose that [formula]. Then there exists k,l such that [formula]. We have {biajζ,bkalζ} linearly dependent for each ζ∈X. It follows from [\cite=BrSe] that biaj has rank one. Thus, there exists ζ0∈X and linear functionals fkl such that [formula] for all 1  ≤  k,l  ≤  n. Set M(ζ) = (fij(ζ))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n for every ζ∈X. Clearly, M(ζ) + M(ζ') = M(ζ  +  ζ'). Observe that if [formula], and x∈A satisfies xζ0  =  ζ, then [formula] and [formula]. Hence M(ζ) is nilpotent. Set [formula]. Then [formula]. Choose [formula] with the property that the set [formula] is linearly independent and pick ζ∈X such that [formula]. It follows from [\cite=BrSe] that for all but finitely many r + 1-tuples [formula], [formula] and [formula] is linearly independent. In particular, for all but finitely many [formula], [formula] is nilpotent. Let N be the vector subspace of [formula] generated by

[formula]

Then it is easy to see that N is nilpotent and [formula]. Applying once again Gerstenhaber's theorem on maximal spaces of nilpotent matrices [\cite=Ger], we infer that [formula] and if [formula], there exists an invertible matrix [formula] such that P- 1NP equals the subspace of nilpotent upper triangular matrices. Suppose that [formula] and let [formula] be the basis corresponding to P of L(φ). Then [formula] for a convenient basis {vi} of R(φ). Set [formula]. Then gij = 0 for i  ≥  j. This completes the proof.

The first non-trivial case allows a particularly nice description.

Let φ be an elementary operator of length 2. Suppose that for every ζ∈X and x∈A such that [formula], φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent. Then φ = Ma,b + Mc,d, where ba = dc = bc = 0.

Write [formula]. Suppose first that [formula]. Then the desired result follows from Theorem [\ref=Ger-qu] and Proposition [\ref=ldimV=1]. Now suppose that {a1,a2} is locally linearly dependent. Then, by [\cite=BrSe], there exists ζ0∈X and linear functionals f1,f2 such that [formula]. We have

[formula]

Suppose for a moment that biζ0  ≠  0 for some i. Since {f1,f2} is linearly independent, we can find x∈A such that fi(xbiζ0) = 1 and fj(xbjζ0) = 0 for j  ≠  i, and we get a contradiction. Thus biaj = 0 for i,j = 1,2.

For each y∈L(X), we define the point spectrum σp(y) by

[formula]

The following result reveals the relationship between the two conditions "quasi-nilpotent" and "of finite rank".

Let [formula] be an elementary operator of length n, and let [formula]. Suppose that #  σp(φ(x))  <  N for all x∈A. Then either biaj has finite rank for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n or there exists a finite-codimensional subspace Y of X such that for every ζ∈Y and x∈A satisfying [formula], φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent.

Suppose that there exists [formula] such that biaj∉F(X) and choose r > 0 maximal with the property that [formula] is linearly independent modulo F(X). Then for each i,j, there exist scalars [formula] and yij∈F(X) such that [formula]. Set [formula]. Then it is easy to see that Y has finite codimension. Suppose that there exists ζ∈Y and x∈A satisfying [formula] and φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is not nilpotent. With no loss of generality, we may suppose that there exists u∈L(φ) such that (φ(x))uζ  =  uζ. Set xbiuζ  =  λiζ and [formula]. Then uζ  =  aζ. Applying [\cite=Nad], we can find [formula] such that [formula] is linearly independent. Let [formula] be distinct numbers. Choose y∈A such that ybikajkζt  =  μtπ(xbikajkζ)ζt. Since [formula] lie in Y, for all i,j, ybiajζt  =  μt(πxbiajζ)ζt. For each c∈L(φ), ybicζt  =  μt(πxbicζ)ζt. Now [formula]. In particular, [formula], a contradiction.

Locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operators of length 3

In this section we shall pay special attention to the case of locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operators of length 3; shorter lengths have been treated elsewhere, see, e.g., [\cite=NaMa11].

Suppose that φ(x) is quasi-nilpotent for every x∈A. For every x∈A and ζ∈X such that [formula], we have φ(x)L(φ)ζ  ⊆  L(φ)ζ. As [formula] is finite, φ(x)|L(φ)ζ is nilpotent and we can apply the results of the previous section. Assuming that [formula], the best case occurs when [formula], that is, when we have a separating vector for L(φ). If, in addition, [formula] is maximal, then we obtain the best possible representation of φ; this was achieved in Theorem [\ref=Ger-qu]. In the case n = 2, [formula] is at most 1 and therefore no complications can occur (Corollary [\ref=2-qu]). However, already in the case n = 3, the gap between [formula] and [formula] widens which results in further "exceptional" descriptions of φ as in the theorem below. Moreover, local nilpotency is no longer sufficient, as is illustrated by an example in Remark [\ref=rem:2-vs-3].

The proof of our main result is organised according to the three levels of difficulty: [formula], [formula] and finally [formula].

Let X be a complex vector space and let A be a dense algebra of linear operators on X. Then [formula] is a locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operator if and only if there exists a representation of φ of the form [formula], ui,vi∈L(X) such that one of the following three cases occurs:

viuj = 0 for all i  ≥  j;

[formula], where {ζ0,ζ1}  ⊆  X is linearly independent and f∈X*;

[formula], where ζ0∈X and {f,g}  ⊆  X* is linearly independent.

Set [formula], ai,bi∈L(X). Suppose first that L(φ) has a separating vector. We distinguish three cases.

Case 1. [formula]. This case follows from Theorem [\ref=Ger-qu].

Case 2. [formula]. Pick ζ∈X satisfying [formula] and [formula] (Lemma [\ref=free]). Set

[formula]

Clearly, N is a nilpotent subspace of [formula] of dimension 2. Let N' be a maximal subspace containing N. Then N' is conjugate to one of the following subspaces by [\cite=Fas] (see also [\cite=FoMa]):

[formula]

Thus, we distinguish two subcases.

Subcase 2.1. There exists ζ∈X and a representation of φ of the form [formula], ui∈L(φ), vi∈R(φ) such that [formula], [formula], and for every x∈A such that [formula], the matrix (π(xviujζ))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3 is upper triangular. Then Clearly, we may assume that one of the sets {v1u2ζ,v1u3ζ} or {v1u3ζ,v2u3ζ} is linearly independent. Using an argument similar to the one used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Ger-qu], we show that R(φ)u1 = 0 or v3L(φ) = 0 and arrive at the desired conclusion.

Subcase 2.2. For every ζ∈X such that [formula] and [formula], there exists a representation of φ of the form [formula], ui∈L(φ), vi∈R(φ) depending on ζ such that, for every x∈A satisfying [formula], the matrix (π(xviujζ))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3 has the form

[formula]

Then we have

[formula]

Now fix a separating vector ζ of L(φ) and V(φ). Set v2u1ζ  =  η1 and v2u3ζ  =  η2. Pick [formula]. Write [formula], for some subspace Y of X. Let [formula] and p2:X  →  Y be the natural projections. Fix [formula]. Let ζ'∈X. Choose xζ'∈X satisfying Set

[formula]

and

[formula]

Observe that if ζ' is a separating vector of L(φ), we have which is nilpotent. Since for every ζ'∈X, ζ' + λζ is a separating vector of L(φ) for all but finitely many [formula], we infer that E(γ1,γ2,γ3) is a nilpotent subspace of [formula]. Next apply once again [\cite=Fas].

Suppose first that E(γ1,γ2,γ3) has dimension 2 for an open set O of values (γ1,γ2,γ3) of [formula]. Then, for every (γ1,γ2,γ3)∈O, ζ1,ζ2,ζ3∈X and w1,w2,w3∈{viuj:1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3}, we must have det ((xζjwiζj)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3) = 0. Let [formula]. Suppose for a moment that viuj  ≠  0. Then {viuj,v2u1,v2u3} is locally linearly dependent. Since viujζ = 0, [formula]. Hence we may suppose that viujζ2  =  η1 and either viujζ3  =  η2, or viujζ3 = 0. Set w1  =  v2(γ2u1  -  γ1u3), w2  =  viuj, w3  =  v2u1, and ζ1  =  ζ. Computing the determinant, and using the fact that xζv2(γ2u1  -  γ1u3)ζ = 0, we see that v2u1ζ2 = 0, which is impossible since we can replace ζ2 by ζ2  +  λζ. Thus viuj = 0. Let ζ' be a separating vector of L(φ). By considering kernels, we see that we must have [formula] where u1', u3' now depend on ζ'. Therefore [formula]. Now it is easy to see that we can put ui  =  ui' for all i. This implies that we must have v2u1  =    -  v3u2 and v1u2 = v2u3.

Now suppose that the set of (γ1,γ2,γ3) for which [formula] is dense in [formula]. Then observe that E(γ1,γ2,γ3) must be triangularizable for an open subset (γ1,γ2,γ3) of [formula]. By considering a common eigenvector, we see that we must have [formula] for every separating vector ζ' of L(φ). As above, we deduce that we can put ui  =  uζ'i for all i.

Next suppose that there exists ζ'∈X with v2u1ζ' = η3. Choose x∈A with xη3  =  ζ, xη2  =  ζ' and xη1 = 0. Then φ(x)(u1ζ' + u2ζ) = u1ζ' + u2ζ, a contradiction. Hence [formula]. Analogously for p1v2u3. We have thereby shown that [formula] for every i,j. Next choose ζ'∈X with v2u1ζ' = 0 (this is possible since the dimension of X is greater than 2). Suppose for a moment that v2u3ζ'  ≠  0. Pick x∈A such that xη1  =  ζ' and xv2u3ζ' = ζ. Then φ(x)(u1ζ  +  u2ζ') = u1ζ  +  u2ζ', a contradiction. Hence v2u1 and v2u3 have the same kernel. Since they are at most rank 2, [formula] is generated by rank one operators. Thus we can assume that v2u3,v2u1 are rank one. Since they must have the same kernel, we conclude that we must have the form (ii).

Case 3. [formula]. It follows from Propositions [\ref=dimV=1] and [\ref=ldimV=1] that we only need to treat the case where [formula]. So suppose that [formula] and set [formula] for all 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3. For every ζ∈X, let M(ζ) = (fij(ζ))1  ≤  i,j  ≤  3 and consider the vector space N = {M(ζ):ζ∈X}. As above, we show that N is a nilpotent subspace of [formula], and hence, either N is triangularizable, or Thus, there exists a representation of φ of the form [formula], ui,vi∈L(X) such that either viuj = 0 for all i  ≥  j or

We now move to the case [formula]. Let ζ be a separating vector of L(φ) and V(φ). Choose u∈L(φ) such that u  ≠  0 and uζ = 0. Write [formula] where u1 = u. Set [formula]. Then arguing as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Ger-qu], we see that for every x∈A satisfying [formula], φ(x)|L(ψ)ζ must be nilpotent. It follows from Corollary [\ref=2-qu] that there exists a representation of [formula] such that djciζ = 0 for j  ≥  i. We have thereby shown that there exists a representation of [formula] such that vjuiζ = 0 for j  ≥  i. Next we adapt the argument used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=Ger-qu] to show that either R(φ)u1 = 0 or v3L(φ) = 0 (since ζ is a separating vector of V(φ), [formula]). Treating the three occurring cases [formula] or 3 separately, it is easy to complete the argument.

Suppose finally that [formula]. Then there exists ζ0∈X such that [formula]. Therefore, for each x∈A and ζ∈X, we have

[formula]

Suppose that biζ0  ≠  0 for some i and choose x∈A such that fi(xbiζ0) = 1, fj(xbiζ0) = 0 for j  ≠  i (this is possible since the set {f1,f2,f3} is linearly independent). Then we get a contradiction. Thus, biaj = 0 for each i,j.

To prove the converse, observe that if [formula] and viuj = 0 for all i  ≥  j, then it follows from Corollary [\ref=prop:elop-nilpotent] that φ(x)4 = 0 for all x∈A. A straightforward computation checking the other cases shows that φ(x)5 = 0 for all x∈A. This completes the proof.

Let [formula] be a locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operator. Then φ*φ = 0 and φ(x)5 = 0 for all x∈A.

Let [formula] be a locally quasi-nilpotent elementary operator. Then one of the following two cases occurs:

there exists a representation of φ of the form [formula], where viuj = 0 for all i  ≥  j;

the space φ(x)L(φ)X has at most dimension 3 for all x∈A, and hence [formula] for all x∈A.

Suppose first that there exists a representation of φ of the form [formula] such that where ζ0,ζ1∈X, f∈X* and {ζ0,ζ1} is linearly dependent. Then

[formula]

Next suppose that there exists a representation of φ of the form [formula] such that where {f,g}  ⊆  X* is linearly independent and ζ0∈X. Then

[formula]

Now the desired conclusion follows from Theorem [\ref=3-qu].
