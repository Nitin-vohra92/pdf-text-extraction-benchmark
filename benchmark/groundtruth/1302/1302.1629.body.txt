Non-expander Cayley graphs of simple groups

Introduction

Let G be a finite group and T a subset of G. The Cayley graph Cay(G,T) is defined by having vertex set G and g is adjacent to h if and only if g- 1h∈T. A Cayley graph Cay(G,T) is undirected if and only if T = T- 1, where [formula].

Let Γ be an arbitrary graph and S  ⊆  V(Γ). We define the boundary of S which we denote by ∂S to be the set of vertices in [formula] with at least one neighbour in S. For a graph Γ the isoperimetric number h(Γ) is defined by

[formula]

A graph Γ is called an ε-expander if h(Γ)  ≥  ε and a series of k-regular graphs Γn is called an expander family if there is a constant ε > 0 such that for every n the graph Γn is an ε-expander. Finally, we say that a family of groups Gn is a family of uniformly expanding groups if there exist [formula] and [formula] such that for every i and every generating set Si  ⊂  Gi of size at most k the Cayley graphs Cay(Gi,Si) are ε-expanders.

The study of series of Cayley graphs of finite simple groups has received great attention. The proof of the fact was completed by Kassabov, Lubotzky and Nikolov in [\cite=3] based on several earlier work (see [\cite=10],[\cite=11],[\cite=12],[\cite=13],[\cite=14]), that there exist [formula] and [formula] such that every non-abelian finite simple group which is not a Suzuki group has a set of generators S of size at most k for which Cay(G,S) is an ε-expander. This work was extended by Breuillard, Green and Tao in [\cite=4] to the Suzuki groups. These results can also motivate the question which was asked by Lubotzky in [\cite=5] whether every family of Chevalley groups of bounded rank is a family of uniformly expanding group.

Lubotzky also suggested to investigate families of simple groups of unbounded rank in [\cite=2] and wrote that it seems likely that if Gn is a sequence of non-abelian simple groups such that the rank of Gn is unbounded, then for every n there exists a generating set Tn  ⊂  Gn such that the graphs Cay(Gn,Tn) do not form a family of expanders. An explicit example (see [\cite=7]) of a non-expander family of Cayley graphs of special linear groups was given by Luz. The diameter of the graphs given by Luz was investigated by Kassabov an Riley and it was proved in [\cite=8] that there exists [formula] such that the diameter of the graphs is smaller than [formula]. Similarly, the symmetric group Sn is generated by γ = (12) and [formula] for every [formula] and the sequence of isoperimetric numbers [formula] tends to 0, see [\cite=7]. Moreover, one can find a set of generators of Sn such that the diameter of the corresponding Cayley graphs is Ω(n2) which gives that these Cayley graphs do not form a family of expanders.

We will investigate 7 series (Al,Bl,Cl,Dl,A12n - 1,A12n,D1n) of finite simple groups of Lie type. These are the groups of Lie type such that the rank of a sequence of groups tends to infinity if we fix a series of the Lie group. In order to define generators and subgroups of these groups we will use the generators given by Steinberg in [\cite=1] and we will use the notation and several results of the book of Carter [\cite=9].

For these 7 series of finite simple groups of Lie type we construct Cayley graphs and subsets such that the number of the neighbours of these subsets depends on the rank of the groups. Moreover, the isoperimetric number of these graphs tends to 0. This proves the conjecture of Lubotzky concerning the series of Cayley graphs of simple groups of unbounded rank. More precisely, we prove the following:

The paper is organized into the following 4 sections. In Section [\ref=pre] we give all necessary definitions and we collect some important fact about the construction of simple groups of Lie type. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1] [\ref=ta] is contained in Section [\ref=chevalley] and Theorem [\ref=thm1] [\ref=tb] which is the case of twisted groups will be handled in Section [\ref=twisted]. In Section [\ref=identification] we present the original construction in terms of matrices which was extended to several different series of simple groups.

Preliminaries

In this section we collect important facts about about finite simple groups of Lie-type and we build up the notation we will use all along this paper.

Let K = GF(q) be a finite field. We denote by Φ the system of roots and [formula] is the union of the positive and negative roots. We also choose [formula] which is the set of the fundamental roots.

The Weyl group W is generated by the fundamental reflections wr, where r∈Π. In order to simplify notation we denote by wi the fundamental reflections wri, where ri∈Π. We denote by xr(ψ) the standard generators of the Chevalley group G, where r∈Φ and ψ∈K. If r = ri for some ri∈Π, then we denote by xi(ψ) the standard generator xri(ψ). These elements generate the Chevalley group G. The subgroups [formula] are called root subgroups of G if r∈Φ.

The Weyl group W is isomorphic to N / H for some [formula]. The cosets of H in N can be written as nwH for all w∈W and N is generated by H and the elements nr for r∈Φ. Moreover, nr = xr(1)x- r( - 1)xr(1) is the element of the subgroup generated by the root subgroups Xr and X- r. It is well known that nrxs(t)n- 1r = xwr(s)(ηr,st) for some ηr,s∈K depending only on r and s, see [\cite=9]. The elements of the normal subgroup H of N can be written in the form h(χ) where χ is a K-character of [formula]. The subgroup H is generated by the elements of the set [formula], where the K-character corresponding to hr(λ) is χr,λ with [formula]. H is a normal subgroup of N and nwh(χ)n- 1w  =  h(χ'), where χ'(r)  =  χ(w- 1(r)) see [\cite=9]. Furthermore, hr(λ)  =  nr(λ)nr( - 1) and hence hr(λ)∈〈Xr,X- r〉, see [\cite=9].

Chevalley groups

In this section we construct series of Cayley graphs for 4 different series of Chevalley groups. For these Chevalley groups we need 6 series of Cayley graphs. The six different constructions are similar but we will treat them separately.

We first prove the following technical lemma.

Let [formula] be a Coxeter element of the Weyl group W and let us assume that the fundamental root ri is orthogonal to rj if i + 1  <  j  ≤  l and ri + 1 is orthogonal to rk if 1  ≤  k  ≤  i - 1. We also assume that ri and ri + 1 have the same length and wi(ri + 1) = ri + ri + 1. Then w(ri)  =  ri + 1.

Al

Let G be a Chevalley group of type Al. The Dynkin diagram of the corresponding root system is the following.

1mm

One can see from the Dynkin diagram that wi(ri + 1) = ri + ri + 1  =  wi + 1(ri) for [formula].

Let [formula] be a Coxeter element of the Weyl group. We choose λ to be a generator of the multiplicative group of GF(q).

x1(1), nw and hr1(λ) generate the Chevalley group G.

For every l  ≥  5 we define the following undirected Cayley graph:

[formula]

Let Ka be the subgroup of the Chevalley group G generated by the root subgroups [formula] and let

[formula]

Every element of the Weyl group W acts on the the root system Φ.

The orbit of w which contains r1 is the following:

1mm

This can be formulated as follows:

It follows from Lemma [\ref=orbita] that if 1  ≤  i  ≤  l - 1, then niwKan- iw contains niwXrl - in- iw = Xrl. Therefore niwKan- iw  ≠  Ka which shows that niw∉Ka for every 1  ≤  i  ≤  l - 1. This implies that [formula] are different right cosets of Ka so Sa is the union of l pairwise disjoint subsets of the vertices of Γa and these subsets have the same cardinality.

[formula]

In order to prove Theorem [\ref=thm1] [\ref=ta] we repeat the previous construction several times. In every single case the connection set of the Cayley graph will consist of few standard generators of the Chevalley group, an element of the form nw, where [formula] is a Coxeter element of the corresponding Weyl group and an element of the group H. If G is of rank l we will choose a subgroup of G which is isomorphic to a Chevalley group of rank l - 1 and which is of the same type. The subset of the vertices for which the isoperimetric number is sufficiently small will be the union of cosets of the subgroup of rank l - 1.

Bl

Let G be a Chevalley group of type Bl The Dynkin diagram of a Chevalley group of type Bl is the following:

1mm

It is easy to see from the Dynkin diagram that w1(r2) = r2  +  2r1 and w2(r1) = r1  +  r2.

One can see using Lemma [\ref=lem] that

[formula]

The fundamental roots [formula] are orthogonal to r1. Therefore w(r1) = w1w2(r1) = w1(r1  +  r2) =  - r1 + (r2  +  2r1)  =  r1 + r2. We also have that w is linear so using equation ([\ref=eq1]) we have that if 2  ≤  j  ≤  l - 1, then

[formula]

Using these observations we conclude that the following picture represents a part of the orbit of the action of the group generated by w including the root r1:

1mm

This can be formulated as follows:

[formula]

The orbit of 〈w〉 containing these elements contains [formula] as well. It is easy to see that [formula] if 2  ≤  i  ≤  l - 1. We also have w1(r2) = 2r1 + r2 hence This implies using equation ([\ref=pot1]) that

[formula]

One can easily describe the remaining elements of the orbit since w is linear.

We also investigate the action of 〈w〉 on [formula] and [formula]. Using equation ([\ref=eq3]) and the linearity of w we get that [formula]. It follows using equation ([\ref=eq1]) that

[formula]

One can also prove using equation ([\ref=negy]) and equation ([\ref=eq4]) that

[formula]

Char(K) > 2

Let us assume that char(K) > 2.

x1(1), nw and ht(λ), where [formula] generate the Chevalley group G of type Bl if the characteristic of the underlying field is not 2.

We define again a sequence of connected Cayley graphs. Let

[formula]

where G is of rank l and [formula]. Similarly to the previous case let

[formula]

and let

[formula]

[formula]

Char(K) = 2

xs(1), x- r1(1), nw and ht(λ), where [formula] generate the Chevalley group G of type Bl if char(K) = 2.

Let

[formula]

The set Sb can be considered as a subset of V(Γb') so we claim the following.

[formula]

Cl

The Dynkin diagram is the following in this case:

1mm It can easily be verified using the Dynkin diagram that wl - 1(rl) = rl  +  2rl - 1 and wl(rl - 1) = rl - 1  +  rl.

Using Lemma [\ref=lem] one can see that w(ri) = ri + 1 for [formula]. We also have Since rl is orthogonal to the remaining roots [formula] we have

[formula]

Since [formula] for [formula] we also have

[formula]

This gives [formula].

Using all these observations we can determine a part of the orbit of 〈w〉 containing r1, which is the following:

1mm

x1(1), nw and hr1(λ) generate the Chevalley group G.

The construction is almost the same as in the case Al. Let

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and let

[formula]

[formula]

Dl

The Dynkin diagram in this case is the following:

1mm

xr1(1), nw and hr1(λ) generate the Chevalley group G if the rank of G is odd.

x- r1(1), xr1(1), x3(1), nw and hr1(λ) generate the Chevalley group G if the rank of G is even.

First, we describe a part of the orbit of 〈w〉 which contains r1. The root r1 is orthogonal to [formula] hence w(r1) = w1w2w3(r1) so we have

[formula]

and similarly

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem] we get w(ri) = ri + 1 for [formula]. This gives that both wi(r1) and wi(r2) are of the form

[formula]

where y = r1 or y = r2.

Odd case

Let us assume that l is odd.

Twisted groups

The twisted groups can be obtained as subgroups of Chevalley groups. In order to define twisted groups we need to find a non-trivial symmetry ρ of the Dynkin diagram. We restrict our attention to those twisted groups which are defined using a symmetry of order 2 and we also assume that the roots in Φ have the same length. It is well known that such an symmetry ρ can be extended to a unique isometry τ of V which is the vector space spanned by Φ. We assume that Aut(GF(q)*) contains an element of order 2. Then the Chevalley group G has an automorphism of order 2, which we denote by α such that [formula] for every r∈  ±  Π and k∈K, where [formula] and [formula].

The subgroup U1 is the set of elements u∈U such that uα = u and similarly [formula]. The twisted group G1 is generated by U1 and V1. The subgroups H1 and N1 are defined as the intersection of G1 with H and N, respectively. We denote by W1 the elements w of the Weyl group W such that τwτ- 1 = w. There is a natural isomorphism of the group W1 to N1 / H1 and we denote by n1w the element of N1  ≤  N which corresponds to w1∈W1.

The set of positive roots Φ+ has a partition where the elements of the partition are of the following form: We denote by Π1 the collection of sets which are elements of the partition. For each set Z in the partition there is a unique element wZ∈W1 which is generated by [formula] such that w(Z) =  - Z. These elements are the following: Every element of Π1 can be obtained as w(Z), where w∈W1 and Z contains a fundamental root. Those sets which contain a fundamental root are called fundamental sets. Moreover, W1 is generated by [formula].

For every Z∈Π1 we denote by XZ the subgroup generated by the root subgroups Xr for r∈Z and [formula].

A12n - 1

The fundamental sets in this case are the following:

[formula]

and the corresponding elements of the Weyl group W1 are:

[formula]

We may assume (see [\cite=9]) that the subgroups defined above are of the following form :

Let [formula] and [formula], where t generates K*. In the following in order to simplify notation we write nw instead of n1w. We also define xe = xr1(1)xr2n - 1(1) which is an element of X1Z1 and which can also be written as [formula].

xe, nw and he generate the group G1.

Let

[formula]

Let

[formula]

and let

[formula]

Ke can be considered as a twisted group which is a subgroup of the Chevalley group generated by the root subgroups [formula]. The corresponding set of fundamental roots is ρ-invariant and we denote by Φ2n - 3 the root system generated by these roots. The restriction of ρ to the set [formula] gives a symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of these roots which extends to an isometry. This isometry is the restriction of τ. This gives that for Z∈Π1 the subgroup X1Z is a subgroup of Ke if and only if Z  ⊂  Φ2n - 3. Clearly, hr(t) is in 〈X1Z,X1- Z〉  ⊂  G1 if [formula] with [formula] and if [formula], then there is homomorphism of SL2(K) onto 〈X1Z,X1- Z〉  ⊂  G1 which shows that [formula] and [formula].

Conjugating by niw∈N1 we get the following:

[formula]

[formula]

D1n

The fundamental sets in this case are the following:

[formula]

and the corresponding elements of the Weyl group W1 are:

[formula]

Let [formula] and [formula], where t generates K*. We also define xf = xr1(1)xr2(1) which can also written as [formula].

xf, nw and hf generate the group G1.

xg, nw and hg generate the group G1.

Let

In order to finish the proof of Theorem ([\ref=thm1]) we have to verify that the for those sets S for which boundary ∂(S) is relatively small we have [formula]. The order of the investigated simple groups is the following:

[formula]

It is easy to see that such a simple group can not have a subgroup of index at most 2l, finishing the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1].

Identification

In this section we give explicit generators of the Cayley graphs that we investigated in Section [\ref=chevalley] and [\ref=twisted]. We also show how to find the subsets of the vertices S for which ∂S is relatively small. We only handle the case of Special Linear Groups which can easily be transformed to the case of the Projective Special Linear Groups which is clearly the easiest one. This example includes the original idea which was extended to several different series of simple groups. In order to show the simplicity of the original construction we forget about the machinery which was built up before.

Let

[formula]

where Al∈GF(q)(l + 1)  ×  (l + 1). Let

[formula]

We denote by Cl the diagonal matrix [formula], where λ generates GF(q)*.

We denote by ei,j the matrix with 1 in the (i,j)-th position and zeros everywhere else and let Ti,j(δ) = I  +  δei,j, where I denotes the identity matrix. Using this notation we can write Al = T1,2(1).

The standard generator xr1(1) of the Chevalley group given in Subsection [\ref=A_l] corresponds to the matrix Al and the Coxeter element nw can be identified with Bl. Finally, Cl plays the role of hr1(λ).

Clearly, Ti,j(α)Ti,j(β)  =  Ti,j(α  +  β) and [formula] if i  ≠  k, where [formula] denotes the commutator of g and h.

For every [formula] the set [formula] forms a generating set of SL(l + 1,q).
