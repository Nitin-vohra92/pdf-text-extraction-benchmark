Consider a Markov chain with finite state [formula] and absorbing at state d. We give out the generation functions (or Laplace transforms) for the absorbing time when the chain starts from any state i. The results generalize the well-known theorems for the birth-death (Karlin and McGregor [\cite=KM], 1959) and the skip-free (Brown and Shao [\cite=BS], 1987) Markov chain starts from state 0. Our proof is directly and simple.

Introduction

For the birth-death and the skip-free (upward jumps may be only of unit size, and there is no restriction on downward jumps) Markov chain with finite state [formula] and absorbing at state d, an well-known interesting property for the absorbing time is that it is distributed as a summation of d independent geometric (or exponential) random variables.

There are many authors give out different proofs to the results. For the birth and death chain, the well-known results can be traced back to Karlin and McGregor ([\cite=KM], 1959) Keilson ([\cite=Keillog], 1971; [\cite=Keil]). Kent and Longford ([\cite=Kent], 1983) proved the result for the discrete time version (nearest random walk) although they have not specified the result as usual form (section 2, [\cite=Kent]). Fill ([\cite=F1], 2009) gave the first stochastic proof to both nearest random walk and birth and death chain cases via duality which was established in [\cite=DF]. Diaconis and Miclo ([\cite=DM], 2009) presented another probabilistic proof for birth and death chain. Very recently, Gong, Mao and Zhang ([\cite=Mao], 2012) gave a similar result in the case that the state space is [formula]. For the skip-free chain, Brown and Shao ([\cite=BS], 1987) first proved the result in continuous time situation; Fill ([\cite=F2], 2009) gave a stochastic proof to both discrete and continuous time cases also by using the duality, and considered the general finite-state Markov chain situation when the chain starts from the state 0.

The purpose of this paper is to consider a general Markov chain with finite-state [formula] and absorbing at state d. We give out the generation functions (or Laplace transforms) for the absorbing time when the chain starts from any state i (not just from state 0 only). In particulary, the results generalize the well-known theorems for the birth-death (Karlin and McGregor [\cite=KM], 1959) and the skip-free (Brown and Shao [\cite=BS], 1987) Markov chain.

Our proof is to calculate directly the generation functions (or Laplace transforms) of the absorbing times by iterating method, which have been used for the skip-free Markov chain by Zhou ([\cite=z13]). After revised the method in [\cite=z13], we found the proof is very simple and enable us to deal with the general finite-state Markov chain starts from any state i. The key idea is to consider directly the absorbing time τi,d starting from any state i.

Discrete time

Define the transition probability matrix P as

[formula]

and for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d + 1, we denote Aj(s) as the d  ×  d sub-matrix by deleting the (d + 1)th line and the jth row of the matrix Id + 1 - sP.

Let τi,d be the absorbing time of state d starting from i and fi(s) be the generation function of τi,d,

[formula]

For   0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1,

[formula]

By decomposing the first step ,the generation function of τi,d satisfy, for 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1,

[formula]

These system of d equations are linear about [formula]. Use Cramer's Rule, we can solve from these system of d equations and get ([\ref=fi]).

Immediately, we obtain the results for the skip-free discrete time Markov chain (Fill [\cite=F2], 2009).

If we assume for j - i > 1, pi,j = 0. We have

[formula]

where [formula] are the d non-unit eigenvalues of P.

In particular, if all of the eigenvalues are real and nonnegative, then the hitting time is distributed as the sum of d independent geometric random variables with parameters 1 - λi.

Note that, 1 is evidently an eigenvalue of P. So on the one hand  [formula] (where [formula] are the d non-unit eigenvalues of P); on the other hand from ([\ref=p]) we have det (Id  +  1  -  sP) = (1 - s)  ×   det Ad + 1(s); as a consequence we get

[formula]

From ([\ref=p]) and the definition of Aj, it is easy to get

[formula]

By ([\ref=fi]) and ([\ref=A]) we have

[formula]

On the other hand, from ([\ref=A1]) we get [formula] and recall that f0(1) = 1 by ([\ref=f]), we obtain that

[formula]

Then by ([\ref=A1]) and ([\ref=cp])

[formula]

and ([\ref=f0]) is immediate from ([\ref=A]) and ([\ref=A2]).

Continuous time

Define the generator Q as and for 1  ≤  j  ≤  d + 1, we denote [formula] as the d  ×  d sub-matrix by deleting the (d + 1)th line and the jth row of the matrix Id + 1 - sP. Let τi,d be the absorbing time of state d starting from i and [formula] be the Laplace transform of τi,d.

It is well known that the chain on the finite state has an simple structure. The process starts at i, it stay there with an  ~ (γi) time, then jumps to i + j with probability [formula], to i - k with probability [formula] .

[formula]

By decomposing the trajectory at the first jump, 0  ≤  i  ≤  d - 1, These system of d equations are linear about [formula]. Use Cramer's Rule, we can solve from these system of d equations and get ([\ref=fi1]).

Immediately, we obtain the results for the skip-free continuous time Markov chain (Brown and Shao [\cite=BS], 1987).

If we assume for j - i > 1, αi,j = 0. We have where λi are the d non-zero eigenvalues of - Q.

In particular, if all of the eigenvalues are real and nonnegative, then the hitting time is distributed as the sum of d independent exponential random variables with parameters λi.

The proof is similar as Corollary [\ref=c1], we can calculate that  [formula],    [formula].
