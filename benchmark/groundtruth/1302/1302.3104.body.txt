Apostol-Euler polynomials arising from umbral calculus

Introduction

Let Πn be the set of all polynomials in a single variable x over the complex field [formula] of degree at most n. Clearly, Πn is a (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over [formula]. Define

[formula]

to be the algebra of formal power series in a single variable t. As is known, 〈L|p(x)〉 denotes the action of a linear functional L∈H on a polynomial p(x) and we remind that the vector space on Πn are defined by

[formula]

for any [formula] and L,L'∈H (see [\cite=K4] [\cite=K5] [\cite=Ro1] [\cite=Ro2]). The formal power series in variable t define a linear functional on Πn by setting

[formula]

By ([\ref=eq7]) and ([\ref=eq8]), we have

[formula]

where δn,k is the Kronecker's symbol. Let [formula] with L∈H. From ([\ref=eq9]), we have 〈fL(t)|xn〉  =  〈L|xn〉. So, the map L  ↦  fL(t) is a vector space isomorphic from Πn onto H. Henceforth, H is thought of as set of both formal power series and linear functionals. We call H the umbral algebra. The umbral calculus is the study of umbral algebra.

Let f(t)∈H. The smallest integer k for which the coefficient of tk does not vanish is called the order of f(t) and is denoted by O(f(t)) (see [\cite=K4] [\cite=K5] [\cite=Ro1] [\cite=Ro2]). If O(f(t)) = 1, O(f(t)) = 0, then f(t) is called a delta, an invertable series, respectively. For given two power series f(t),g(t)∈H such that O(f(t)) = 1 and O(g(t)) = 0, there exists a unique sequence Sn(x) of polynomials with 〈g(t)(f(t))k|Sn(x)〉 = n!δn,k (this condition sometimes is called orthogonality type) for all [formula]. The sequence Sn(x) is called the Sheffer sequence for (g(t),f(t)) which is denoted by Sn(x)  ~  (g(t),f(t)) (see [\cite=K4] [\cite=K5] [\cite=Ro1] [\cite=Ro2]).

For f(t)∈H and p(x)∈Π, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

(see [\cite=K4] [\cite=K5] [\cite=Ro1] [\cite=Ro2]). From ([\ref=eq11]), we derive

[formula]

where p(k)(0) denotes the k-th derivative of p(x) respect to x at x = 0. Let Sn(x)  ~  (g(t),f(t)). Then we have

[formula]

for all [formula], where (t) is the compositional inverse of f(t) (see [\cite=K4] [\cite=K5] [\cite=K] [\cite=R] [\cite=Ro1] [\cite=Ro2]).

For [formula] with λ  ≠   - 1, the Apostol-Euler polynomials (see [\cite=H] [\cite=N] [\cite=T] [\cite=W]) are defined by the generating function to be

[formula]

In particular, x = 0, En(0|λ) = En(λ) is called the n-th Apostol-Euler number. From ([\ref=eqa1]), we can derive

[formula]

By ([\ref=eqa2]), we have [formula]. Also, from ([\ref=eqa1]) we have

[formula]

with the usual convention about replacing En(λ) by En(λ). By ([\ref=eqa3]), we get

[formula]

Thus, by comparing the coefficients of the both sides, we have

[formula]

As is well known, Bernoulli polynomial (see [\cite=AA] [\cite=BK1] [\cite=C] [\cite=DD]) is also defined by the generating function to be

[formula]

In the special case, x = 0, Bn(0) = Bn is called the n-th Bernoulli number. By ([\ref=eqa5]), we get

[formula]

From ([\ref=eqa5]), we note that

[formula]

with the usual convention about replacing Bn by Bn. By ([\ref=eqa6]) and ([\ref=eqa7]), we get

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

Euler polynomials (see [\cite=AA] [\cite=BK2] [\cite=C] [\cite=Ro2]) are defined by

[formula]

In the special case, x = 0, En(0) = En is called the n-th Euler number. By ([\ref=eqa9]), we get

[formula]

with the usual convention about replacing En by En. By ([\ref=eqa9]) and ([\ref=eqa10]), we get

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

For [formula] with λ  ≠   - 1, the Frobenius-Euler (see [\cite=AA] [\cite=Cb] [\cite=Ca] [\cite=CCKS] [\cite=CKOS]) polynomials are defined by

[formula]

In the special case, x = 0, Fn(0| - λ) = Fn( - λ) is called the n-th Frobenius-Euler number (see [\cite=Ca]). By ([\ref=eqa12]), we get

[formula]

with the usual convention about replacing Fn( - λ) by Fn( - λ) (see [\cite=Ca]). By ([\ref=eqa12]) and ([\ref=eqa13]), we get

[formula]

which implies

[formula]

In the nest section we present our main theorem and its applications. More precisely, by using the orthogonality type, we write any polynomial in Πn as a linear combination of the Apostol-Euler polynomials. Several applications related to Bernoulli, Euler and Frobenius-Euler polynomials are derived.

Main results and applications

Note that the set of the polynomials [formula] is a good basis for Πn. Thus, for p(x)∈Πn, there exist constants [formula] such that [formula]. Since En(x|λ)  ~  ((1 + λet) / 2,t) (see ([\ref=eq14]) and [\eqref=eqa1])), we have

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

Hence, we can state the following result.

For all p(x)∈Πn, there exist constants [formula] such that [formula], where

[formula]

Now, we present several applications for our theorem. As a first application, let us take p(x) = xn with [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=th1], we have [formula], where

[formula]

which implies the following identity.

For all [formula],

[formula]

Let p(x) = Bn(x)∈Πn, then by Theorem [\ref=th1] we have that [formula], where

[formula]

which, by ([\ref=eqa8]), implies the following identity.

For all [formula],

[formula]

Let p(x) = En(x), then by Theorem [\ref=th1] we have that [formula], where

[formula]

which, by ([\ref=eqa11]), implies the following identity.

For all [formula],

[formula]

For another application, let p(x) = Fn(x| - λ), then by Theorem [\ref=th1] we have that [formula], where

[formula]

which, by ([\ref=eqa14]), implies the following identity.

For all [formula],

[formula]

Again, let [formula] be the n-th Bessel polynomial (which is the solution of the following differential equation x2f''(x) + 2(x + 1)f' + n(n + 1)f = 0, where f'(x) denotes the derivative of f(x), see [\cite=Ro1] [\cite=Ro2]). Then by Theorem [\ref=th1], we can write [formula], where

[formula]

which implies the following identity.

For all [formula],

[formula]

We end by noting that if we substitute λ = 0 in any of our corollaries, then we get the well known value of the polynomial p(x). For instance, by setting λ = 0, the last corollary gives that [formula] as expected.
