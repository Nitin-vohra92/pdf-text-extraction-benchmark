On the Relationship between D'Angelo q-type and Catlin q-type

Introduction

The study of the order of contact of complex varieties with the boundary of a domain in [formula] stems from the investigation of the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem. Kohn proved in 1979 in [\cite=kohnacta] that for a pseudoconvex domain in [formula] with real-analytic boundary the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem for (p,q) forms is equivalent to the property that all holomorphic varieties of complex dimension q have finite order of contact with the boundary of the domain. D'Angelo introduced a quantitative measure, written Δq, for this order of contact. D'Angelo fleshed out its more important properties culminating with openness and finite determination, which he established in 1982 in [\cite=opendangelo]. Meanwhile, Catlin extended Kohn's result to smooth pseudoconvex domains in [\cite=catlinnec], [\cite=catlinbdry], and [\cite=catlinsubell]. The notion of finite order of contact of holomorphic varieties of complex dimension q with the boundary of the domain that he defined in [\cite=catlinsubell] and showed is equivalent to the subellipticity of the [formula]-Neumann problem for (p,q) forms for smooth pseudoconvex domains is not the same as D'Angelo's notion. The two trivially agree for q = 1, i.e. for holomorphic curves, but for q > 1 Catlin merely expressed the hope that they might be shown to equal each other. Catlin's notion is what became known as Catlin q-type, Dq. In 1999 in a joint survey paper by D'Angelo and Kohn [\cite=kohndangelo], it was claimed that these two notions ought to be simultaneously finite.

In [\cite=catlinsubell] Catlin also proved a lower bound for subelliptic gain in the [formula]-Neumann problem

[formula]

that holds for any smooth pseudoconvex domain in [formula] and is exponential in τ = Dq, his notion of contact of holomorphic varieties of complex dimension q with the boundary of the domain. Apart from Catlin's result, there are a number of either sharp or effective bounds for subelliptic gain for (0,1) forms, i.e. when q = 1, in terms of Δ1 = D1; see [\cite=siunote], [\cite=catlincho], [\cite=khanhzampieri], and [\cite=fribourgcatda]. Any other such result for q > 1 obtained in terms of D'Angelo's more standardly used notion of q-type would have to be compared against Catlin's benchmark estimate. Herein lies the significance of our work in this paper as we relate Δq to Dq for q > 1, thus enabling this type of comparison.

Both Δq and Dq can also be defined for ideals [formula] in the ring [formula] of germs of holomorphic functions at x0. Comparing Δq with Dq for such an ideal is much simpler, so we first prove a result of this nature:

Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem] is consistent with the simple result that [formula] for any ideal [formula] of germs of holomorphic functions in n variables.

Our main result is the following:

Theorem

Let Ω in [formula] be a domain with [formula] boundary. Let x0∈bΩ be a point on the boundary of the domain, and let 1  ≤  q < n.

Dq(bΩ,x0)  ≤  Δq(bΩ,x0);

If Δq(bΩ,x0) <   ∞   and the domain is q-positive at x0 (the q version of D'Angelo's property P), then

[formula]

In particular, if bΩ is pseudoconvex at x0 and Δq(bΩ,x0) <   ∞  , then

[formula]

Since Δq(bΩ,x0) = Dq(bΩ,x0) for q = 1, inequality (i) is sharp. By definition, Dq(bΩ,x0)  ≥  2, and

[formula]

so Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] (ii) is not sharp. It is, however, the best result that can be obtained given our method. An example illustrating this point will be provided in Section [\ref=mainthmpf]. We exclude the value q = n because bΩ has real dimension 2n - 1, so looking at its order of contact with an n dimensional complex variety does not make sense. It is also known that subellipticity with exponent ε = 1 holds at all boundary points for (p,n) forms. The reader may consult p.83 of [\cite=kohnacta]. The last part of Theorem  [\ref=maintheorem] follows because a pseudoconvex domain where Δq(bΩ,x0) <   ∞   satisfies q-positivity at x0, a generalization of D'Angelo's property P for q > 1. We are deliberately avoiding the terminology property P here in order to be consistent with D'Angelo's usage in [\cite=dangelo]. D'Angelo introduced property P in [\cite=opendangelo] for a notion of positivity more general than pseudoconvexity. Shortly afterward, Catlin introduced Property (P) in [\cite=catlinpropp], which has since become a standard notion in several complex variables. Details can be found in [\cite=catlinpropp], [\cite=boasstraubesurvey], and [\cite=straubebook]. The two names are similar enough to create confusion, so D'Angelo suppressed the term property P in subsequent work, a practice we are following here by employing q-positivity instead. We would also like to note that our method of proving Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] (ii) breaks down completely in the absence of q-positivity, and we have no examples on which we could even formulate a conjecture as to whether Δq are Dq remain simultaneously finite.

The paper is organized as follows: Section [\ref=findap] defines D'Angelo q-type and outlines a number of its properties. D'Angelo's property P is also defined here along with q-positivity, its q version for q > 1. Section [\ref=fincat] is devoted to the Catlin q-type. The two notions are then related to each other in Section [\ref=mainthmpf], where Theorems [\ref=idealtheorem] and [\ref=maintheorem] are also proven.

D'Angelo q-type and q-positivity

Starting with [\cite=dangelofirst], D'Angelo introduced various numerical functions that measure the maximum order of contact of holomorphic varieties of complex dimension q with a real hypersurface M in [formula] such as the boundary of a domain; see [\cite=dangelo].

We shall first give the classical definition of order of contact for q = 1, holomorphic curves. Let r be a defining function for the real hypersurface M in [formula]. Let [formula] be the set of all germs of holomorphic curves

[formula]

where U is some neighborhood of the origin in [formula] and φ(0) = p. For all t∈U, [formula] where φj(t) is holomorphic for every j with 1  ≤  j  ≤  m. For each component φj, the order of vanishing at the origin [formula] is the order of the first non-vanishing derivative of φj, i.e. [formula] such that

[formula]

but [formula] We set [formula] Consider φ*r, the pullback of r to φ, and let [formula] be the order of the first non-vanishing derivative at the origin of φ*r viewed as a function of t.

When holomorphic varieties have complex dimension greater than 1, there is no longer just one natural definition of their order of contact with a real hypersurface in [formula] as not every holomorphic variety of dimension q  ≥  2 has a local parametrization. Following D'Angelo in [\cite=opendangelo], one approach is to reduce this case to computing Δ1(,x0) for a related hypersurface [formula] sitting in a different [formula] such that the holomorphic varieties of dimension q generically become holomorphic curves in the new ambient space. Let [formula] be any linear embedding of [formula] into [formula] For generic choices of φ, the pullback φ*M will be a hypersurface in [formula] We can thus define Δq(M,x0) as follows:

Definition

Theorem

Remarks:

(1) Part (iii) is Theorem 6.2 from p.634 of [\cite=opendangelo] and implies the set of points of finite q-type is open. Note that the result holds independently of pseudoconvexity.

(2) Part (iv) is Proposition 14 from p.88 of [\cite=dangeloftc] whose proof implies that if t  =  Δq(M,x0)  <    ∞  , then we can let k  =  ⌈t⌉, the ceiling of t, i.e. the least integer greater than or equal to t.

For the purpose of relating Δq(bΩ,x0) with Dq(bΩ,x0), we will need to show that Δq(bΩ,x0) is generic with respect to the choices of linear embeddings [formula] In fact, linear embeddings [formula] are in one-to-one correspondence with non-degenerate sets of q - 1 linear forms [formula] in [formula] the local ring of holomorphic germs in n variables at [formula] The zero set of [formula] is locally the image of the embedding φ.

Restating the embedding φ as a non-degenerate set of linear forms points to the necessity of having a notion of type that applies to an ideal rather than just a hypersurface, which is what has been defined so far. Indeed, D'Angelo makes the following definition on p.86 of [\cite=dangeloftc]:

Definition

Remark: If M be a real hypersurface in [formula] and x0∈M, let [formula] be the ideal of smooth germs in C∞x0 that vanish on the germ of M at x0. Then [formula] because the infimum in Definition [\ref=idealtype] is realized by a defining function of M, which has order 1 at x0.

Now we can give an equivalent definition to Definition [\ref=qfinitetype] that was first stated by D'Angelo on the bottom of p.86 of [\cite=dangeloftc]:

Definition

This same definition can also be given for an ideal [formula] in [formula] and is the notion that appears in the statement of Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem]:

Definition

Since working in the ring C∞x0 is not particularly easy, it would be helpful to reduce the computation of Δq(M,x0) to a computation in [formula] which has much better algebraic properties. Let us assume for the moment that Δq(M,x0)  =  t  <    ∞  , and let k  =  ⌈t⌉, the ceiling of t. By Theorem [\ref=propdeltaqthm] (iv) and remark (2) following it, Δq(M,x0)  =  Δq(Mk,x0), where Mk is real hypersurface defined by rk, the polynomial that has the same k-jet at x0 as the defining function r of M. The advantage of working with rk is that we can apply polarization to it, namely we can give a holomorphic decomposition for rk as

[formula]

where [formula] [formula] and the functions [formula] are all holomorphic polynomials in n variables. This idea first appeared in Section III of [\cite=opendangelo]. Furthermore, if [formula] is the group of N  ×  N unitary matrices, then for every such unitary matrix [formula] we can consider the ideal of holomorphic polynomials [formula] generated by h and the N components of f - Ug, where [formula] and [formula] It turns out that

[formula]

We have used Corollary 3.7 on p.627 of [\cite=opendangelo]. If we now combine this result with Definition [\ref=qfinitetypeequiv] and Theorem [\ref=propdeltaqthm] (iv), we obtain

[formula]

Since [formula] is compact, the supremum over it would be easy to handle if Δ1 were an upper semi-continuous quantity, but it is not as shown by D'Angelo in [\cite=nonusc]. We thus need to compare Δ1 to some other quantity computed in [formula] that is upper semi-continuous. We will use

[formula]

where [formula] is an ideal of holomorphic germs at x0. Here [formula] means the dimension of [formula] viewed as a vector space over [formula] This notion appears under different names in the literature. For example, on p.153 of [\cite=catlinsubell], Catlin calls it the multiplicity of the ideal [formula]

Proposition

This result is part of Proposition 5.3 on p.39 of [\cite=tougeron] cited by D'Angelo in [\cite=opendangelo]. In our case, [formula] obviously depends continuously on U, so [formula] is upper semi-continuous on the compact set [formula] Thus [formula] achieves a maximum on [formula] because each [formula] has an open neighborhood V(U) such that

[formula]

for every U'∈V(U) from the upper semi-continuity, {V(U)} is an open cover of [formula] we can thus pass to a finite open subcover {V(Uj)}1  ≤  j  ≤  p, and then we can take [formula]

Since we are primarily interested in the case q > 1, the object that appears naturally corresponding to a proper ideal [formula] in [formula] is [formula] where [formula] is a non-degenerate set of linear forms. It turns out that [formula] is generic when we consider its value over all non-degenerate sets of linear forms [formula]

Proposition

Proof: For every non-degenerate set of linear forms [formula] in [formula] we consider a linear change of variables at x0 such that [formula] become the coordinate functions [formula] Let [formula] be the image of [formula] under this linear change of variables. Consider now

[formula]

Since the variables [formula] get set to zero in the quotient [formula] and the quantity [formula] is invariant under linear changes of variables, it follows that

[formula]

as needed.

Propositions  [\ref=duscprop] and  [\ref=multgeneric] together make looking at

[formula]

much easier in the sense that the supremum and the infimum, which are both achieved, can be exchanged here. D'Angelo has already related this quantity to Δq(M,x0) in Theorem 14 on p.91 of [\cite=dangeloftc]:

Theorem

We shall use the lower bound,

[formula]

in the proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem].

Another ingredient in the proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] is showing that Δq(M,x0) assumes the generic value with respect to choices of non-degenerate sets of linear forms [formula] in its definition:

Proposition

Proof: We consider two cases. First, if

[formula]

then clearly [formula] for every non-degenerate set of linear forms [formula] in [formula] so

[formula]

i.e. the infimum is achieved and equal to the generic value. Second, assume Δq(M,x0)  =  t  <    ∞  . One of the equivalent ways of defining Δq(M,x0) is as

[formula]

Obviously, the supremum is realized here by curves that set [formula] to zero as these functions have the lowest order of vanishing, namely 1. It follows that

[formula]

and the infimum over all non-degenerate sets [formula] of linear forms in [formula] is indeed achieved and equal to the generic value.

We shall now state as a corollary the equivalent result for [formula] which is needed for the proof of Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem]:

Corollary

Proof: The proof of Proposition [\ref=deltaqgeneric] applies verbatim with [formula] replacing Δq(M,x0) and [formula] replacing [formula]

For the proof of Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem], we also need to state part of D'Angelo's Theorem 2.7 from p.622 of [\cite=opendangelo]:

Theorem

Finally, we turn our attention to D'Angelo's property P, which he defined on p.631 of [\cite=opendangelo]:

Definition

Remarks:

(1) Due to Theorem [\ref=propdeltaqthm] (iv), the finite determination property of Δq(M,x0) for all 1  ≤  q < n, this definition is independent of k provided k is large enough.

(2) Since the D'Angelo type does not depend on the coordinate system and is always greater than or equal to 2, no holomorphic curve with [formula] can realize the supremum. The function h has order 1 at x0 and can be mapped to zn via a change of coordinates. Hence holomorphic curves satisfying [formula] are irrelevant to the type consideration.

Let us now define the q version of D'Angelo's property P, q-positivity, the hypothesis that appears in Theorem [\ref=maintheorem].

Definition

Remark: The change here versus D'Angelo's property P is that we ask that his conditions be satisfied only for the holomorphic curves that come into the computation of Δq(M,x0).

The reason D'Angelo introduced property P is that it allowed him to prove the following result, which appears as Theorem 5.3 on p.631 of [\cite=opendangelo]:

Theorem

A pseudoconvex domain of finite D'Angelo type has property P as do the hypersurfaces corresponding to truncations of the defining function at x0 of any order higher than the type. Before formally stating this result, we shall state a proposition that appeared as Proposition 2 on p.138 of [\cite=dangelo], which justifies why such a result ought to be true.

Proposition

Remark: Condition (ii) is eliminating pure terms up to and including of order m, which is the vanishing order of φ*r. The same is achieved via the requirement that [formula] in the definition of D'Angelo's property P as well as in the definition of q-positivity.

The following result appears on p.632 of [\cite=opendangelo]:

Proposition

It is easy to see from Proposition [\ref=pscproppauxiliary] that the equivalent result should hold for q-positivity as well:

Proposition

Catlin q-type

Catlin wished to avoid having to characterize the order of contact of a holomorphic variety Vq of complex dimension q with the boundary of the domain along the singular locus of the variety, which can be considerably more complicated when q > 1 than for holomorphic curves. To that end, he introduced in [\cite=catlinsubell] a numerical function Dq(M,x0) that measures the order of contact of varieties Vq with M only along generic directions. Following D'Angelo in [\cite=opendangelo], he also defined such an order of contact [formula] for an ideal [formula] of holomorphic germs in [formula]

Let Vq be the germ of a holomorphic variety of complex dimension q passing through x0. Let Gn - q + 1 be the set of all (n - q + 1)-dimensional complex planes through x0. Consider the intersection [formula] for S∈Gn - q + 1. For a generic, thus open and dense, subset W̃ of Gn - q + 1, [formula] consists of finitely many irreducible one-dimensional components VqS,k for [formula] Let us parametrize each such germ of a curve by some open set Uk∋0 in [formula] Thus, γkS:Uk  →  VqS,k, where γkS(0) = x0. For every holomorphic germ [formula] consider the quantity

[formula]

Likewise, for r the defining function of a real hypersurface M in [formula] passing through x0, set

[formula]

In Section 3 of [\cite=catlinsubell], Catlin showed [formula] assumes the same value for all S in a generic subset W̃ of planes. Therefore, he defined

[formula]

and

[formula]

In the same section 3 of [\cite=catlinsubell], Catlin showed [formula] assumes the same value for all S in a generic subset W̃ of planes, so he defined

[formula]

Definition

Clearly, Δ1(M,x0)  =  D1(M,x0) as there is only one n-dimensional complex plane passing through x0 in [formula]

Some more explanations are in order regarding Catlin's construction. We have claimed [formula] and [formula] are constant on a generic set W̃ of (n - q + 1)-dimensional complex planes S through x0. The quantities [formula] and [formula] are computed by looking at the normalized vanishing orders of f and r respectively along the curves VqS,k for [formula] that represent the intersection of Vq with S. In fact, the number of curves in the intersection, P is the same for all S∈W̃, and furthermore, the curves VqSa,k can be smoothly parametrized via a parameter [formula] for N = (n - q + 1)(q - 1), the dimension of W̃. Proposition 3.1 (ii) on p.140 of [\cite=catlinsubell] states that as Sa∈W̃ varies smoothly, the intersection curves VqSa,k do as well, and their number stays constant.

In his proof of Proposition 3.1 from [\cite=catlinsubell], Catlin has to remove three different sets W1, W2, and W3 from Gn - q + 1 in order to arrive at his generic set W̃ on which such strong conclusions hold. To the germ of the variety Vq, there corresponds a prime ideal [formula] in the ring [formula] of all germs of holomorphic functions that vanish on Vq. Catlin uses Gunning's Local Parametrization Theorem from p.16 of [\cite=gunning] in order to construct a set of canonical equations for Vq. This construction involves choosing a special set of coordinates where the generators of the ideal simultaneously satisfy the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem with respect to the variables that give the regular system of parameters [formula] has as a prime ideal in the regular local ring [formula] The intersection [formula] is ill-behaved where Vq does not have pure dimension q as the intersection might consist of points rather than curves as well as along the singular locus of Vq. To remove both, Catlin constructs a conic variety X' whose defining equation consists of the product of the discriminants of the Weierstrass polynomials that give the canonical equations for Vq (these discriminants capture the singular locus of Vq) with the additional generator that gives the non pure dimensional part of Vq. W1 consists of all (n - q + 1)-dimensional complex planes that intersect X'.

Additionally, for the intersection [formula] to behave well, a good notion of transversality has to apply. Transversality cannot be tested well for curves, which is what [formula] yields generically, but it can be tested very well for points. To reduce the intersection to points, Catlin looks at the conic variety corresponding to Vq, which he calls V'. The variety V' captures the tangent cone of Vq, exactly where singularities of Vq manifest themselves as the dimension of the tangent cone jumps at a singular point. V' still has dimension q. Consider ṽ, the projective variety in [formula] corresponding to V'. ṽ has dimension q - 1. For every S∈Gn - q + 1, there corresponds a projective plane S̃ of dimension n - q in [formula] Generically, [formula] consists of finitely many points [formula] with transverse intersections, meaning that each i is a smooth point of ṽ and the tangent spaces satisfy [formula] for [formula] Let W2 be the subset of Gn - q + 1 where this generic behavior does not take place.

Finally, the construction of W1 involved the use of canonical equations for Vq. Hence variables [formula] give the regular system of parameters corresponding to the pure q-dimensional part of the variety Vq. The variable zq corresponds to the additional generator that gives the non pure dimensional part of Vq. The (n - q + 1)-dimensional complex plane S is defined by the linear equations [formula] for [formula] which need to be linearly independent. A (q - 1)  ×  (q - 1) minor of (aij) should thus have full rank. On the other hand, for the intersection [formula] to behave well, this (q - 1)  ×  (q - 1) minor should be exactly (aij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  q - 1 with respect to the complementary variables [formula] Therefore, Catlin sets

[formula]

We shall now state the rest of the results from [\cite=catlinsubell] that play a role in the proofs of Theorems [\ref=idealtheorem] and [\ref=maintheorem]. The following is Catlin's Theorem 3.7 on p.154 of [\cite=catlinsubell]:

Theorem

Remark: In the context of Catlin's definitions, the (n - q + 1)-dimensional complex plane S through x0 is precisely the zero locus of the non-degenerate set of linear forms [formula]

Since [formula] for all k  ≥  q, we obtain the following corollary to Theorem [\ref=catlinmultthm]:

Corollary

In case Δq(M,x0) = t <   ∞  , the truncation rk of the defining function r of M at x0 of order k  =  ⌈t⌉ has the holomorphic decomposition rk  =  Re{h}  +  ||f||2 - ||g||2, and M is q-positive at x0, we would like to relate τ(Vq,x0) to [formula] for any unitary matrix [formula] and any q-dimensional complex variety Vq. The reader may wish to check by going through the proof of D'Angelo's Theorem 5.3 on p.631 of [\cite=opendangelo], which we stated here as Theorem [\ref=1propertyP], that q-positivity at x0 implies

[formula]

Catlin uses this reasoning on p.156 of [\cite=catlinsubell] in order to finish the proof of his Theorem 3.4 without formally defining q-positivity. Instead, he employs this argument for a pseudoconvex domain, where we have shown that q-positivity holds if the D'Angelo q-type is finite. Catlin assumes that Dq(M,x0) is finite instead.

Comparing Δq with Dq

The proof of Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem] is comprised of two results.

Proof: Let [formula] else the estimate is trivially true. Assume [formula] Since [formula] is defined as the supremum over all q-dimensional holomorphic varieties passing through x0 of [formula] there exists such a holomorphic variety Vq for which

[formula]

but as shown in Proposition [\ref=deltaqgenericideal], [formula] is generic over the choice of S, so the curves in [formula] already enter into the computation of [formula] Therefore, [formula] a contradiction.

Proposition

Proof: Let [formula] be any non-degenerate set of linear forms in [formula] First, we apply Theorem [\ref=dangeloinequality] to the ideal [formula] to obtain

[formula]

Next, we take the generic value over all non-degenerate sets [formula] of linear forms in [formula]

[formula]

By Corollary [\ref=deltaqgenericideal],

[formula]

while by Corollary [\ref=catlinmultcorollary],

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem]: Proposition [\ref=idealleftprop] proves the left-hand side inequality, while Proposition [\ref=idealrightprop] proves the right-hand side one.

As mentioned in the introduction, if q = n, Theorem [\ref=idealtheorem] implies [formula] for every ideal [formula] in [formula] From the proof of Proposition [\ref=idealrightprop], it follows that

[formula]

Applying Catlin's Theorem [\ref=catlinmultthm] together with Equation [\eqref=nval] allows us to give the corresponding result to Corollary [\ref=catlinmultcorollary] for an ideal [formula] in [formula] arising from a holomorphic decomposition rk  =  Re{h}  +  ||f||2 - ||g||2 of the truncation rk of the defining function r of the real hypersurface M at x0 when Δq(M,x0) = t and k  =  ⌈t⌉:

Corollary

Proof: rk  =  Re{h}  +  ||f||2 - ||g||2 defines a real hypersurface in [formula] so the holomorphic function h must contain a term of first order, else the gradient of rk would be zero at x0. Therefore, the ideal [formula] contains an element with a term of first order. From Theorem [\ref=catlinmultthm], we know

[formula]

while Equation [\eqref=nval] gives us

[formula]

The fact that [formula] contains an element with a term of first order means that generically [formula] which implies [formula] Since [formula] for all k  ≥  q, the result follows.

Remark: The claim [formula] appears at the top of p.156 of [\cite=catlinsubell].

Each part of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] will now be proven in a separate proposition.

Proposition

Proof: Modulo notational changes, the same proof as for Proposition [\ref=idealleftprop] applies here, but we give it again for completeness. If Δq(bΩ,x0) =   ∞  , then the estimate is obviously true. We thus restrict ourselves to the case when Δq(bΩ,x0) = t  <    ∞  . Assume the estimate is false, i.e. Dq(bΩ,x0) > t. Since Dq(M,x0) is defined as the supremum over all q-dimensional holomorphic varieties passing through x0 of τ(Vq,x0), there exists such a holomorphic variety Vq for which

[formula]

but as we have shown in Proposition [\ref=deltaqgeneric], Δq(bΩ,x0) is generic over the choice of S, so the curves in [formula] enter into the computation of Δq(bΩ,x0). Therefore,

[formula]

which is obviously a contradiction.

Proposition

Proof: Since the domain is q-positive at x0, as shown at the end of Section [\ref=fincat], we obtain

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

In other words,

[formula]

and

[formula]

We can now take the supremum on the right over all unitary matrices [formula] and use Corollary [\ref=catlinmultbdrycorollary] to obtain By Proposition [\ref=multgeneric] and Equation [\eqref=qbound],

Proof of Theorem [\ref=maintheorem]: We put together the results of Proposition [\ref=proposition1] with Proposition [\ref=proposition2] and the fact mentioned in Section [\ref=findap] that a pseudoconvex domain is q-positive when Δq(bΩ,x0) <   ∞  , namely Proposition [\ref=pscqproppproposition].

Let us now address the issue of sharpness for Theorem [\ref=maintheorem] (ii) via an example. Corollary [\ref=catlinmultbdrycorollary], a consequence of Catlin's Theorem [\ref=catlinmultthm], is an essential part of the proof of Proposition [\ref=proposition2] and is responsible for the jump in power that destroys any chance for this type of proof to yield the sharp estimate when q = 1. Yet, a result like Corollary [\ref=catlinmultbdrycorollary] cannot be avoided because it relates the only truly well-behaved quantity in the problem [formula] which is upper semi-continuous with respect to U and generic over the choice of [formula] to Dq. Note that upper semi-continuity is necessary because it allows one to handle the supremum over all unitary matrices produced by polarization, exactly the technique that reduces the problem from the ill-behaved local ring C∞x0 to [formula] We shall now show by example that Corollary [\ref=catlinmultbdrycorollary] and Theorem [\ref=catlinmultthm] are both sharp. Let r = Re{z3}  +  |z31|2 + |z32|2 and n = 3. Since g = 0 in the holomorphic decomposition, no unitary matrices appear in its corresponding holomorphic ideal [formula] [formula] and [formula] so [formula] for q = 1. To show Theorem [\ref=catlinmultthm] is also sharp, we drop z3 from this ideal, and consider [formula] for n = 2. Once again, [formula] and [formula] By Equation [\eqref=nval] above, [formula] so when q = 1

[formula]

For comparison, see Example 2.14.1 on p.624 of [\cite=opendangelo] used by D'Angelo to show the inequalities in his Theorem 2.7 were sharp.

We now compute Δq and Dq for q = 1,2,3 for three ideals of germs of holomorphic functions of three variables. Trivially, Δ1 = D1 and Δ3  =  D3:

(a) [formula] Here [formula] is a surface, hence [formula] and [formula] while [formula]

(b) [formula] where [formula] m > 3. Here [formula] is a curve, hence [formula] [formula] is obtained by using [formula] the variety corresponding to the ideal   =  (z31  +  z32 - z33). [formula]

(c) Let [formula] be any ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials in z1, z2, and z3 all of degree p satisfying that [formula] In this case, [formula] [formula] while [formula]

In these examples Δ2  =  D2 as well, but it is the authors' hope that a future investigation will reveal whether equality holds in general or is merely an artifact here of the difficulty of computing Dq.
