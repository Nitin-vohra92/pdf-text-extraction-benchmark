Introduction

In this article, we discuss the relationship among the following conjectures:

From now on, Conjecture [formula] (resp. Conjecture [formula]) stands for Conjecture [formula] with dim X = n (resp. dim X  ≤  n). Remark that in Conjectures [\ref=conj_F], [\ref=conj_F_big], and [\ref=conj_M] we may assume that (X,Δ) is log smooth, i.e., X is smooth and Δ has a simple normal crossing support by taking suitable resolutions.

The following result is the main theorem:

Conjectures [\ref=conj_F]n, [\ref=conj_F_big]n, and [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1 are all equivalent.

We remark that Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]≤  n by Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] because Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]≤  n - 1 directly follows from Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1. We also remark that the equivalence of Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]n and Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1 seems to be a folklore statement, though we have never seen the explicit statement in the literature.

In [\cite=fm], the first author and Shigefumi Mori proved that the finite generation of the log canonical rings for projective klt pairs can be reduced to the case when the log canonical divisors are big by using the so-called Fujino-Mori canonical bundle formula (see [\cite=fm]). This reduction seems to be indispensable for the finite generation of the log canonical rings for klt pairs (see, for example, [\cite=bchm], [\cite=lazic], and so on). Unfortunately, the reduction arguments in [\cite=fm] can not be directly applied to log canonical pairs because the usual perturbation techniques do not work well for log canonical pairs (cf. Remark [\ref=fm-reduction]). The following statement is contained in our main theorem: Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]n.

Corollary [\ref=cor0] is one of the motivations of this paper. The proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] (and Corollary [\ref=cor0]) heavily depends on the recent developments in the minimal model theory after [\cite=bchm], for example, [\cite=bir-exiII], [\cite=dhp-ext], [\cite=fg3], [\cite=g4], [\cite=hmx], and so on. It is completely different from the reduction techniques discussed in [\cite=fm].

In Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big], we may assume that X is smooth, Δ has a simple normal crossing support, ⌊Δ⌋ is irreducible, and KX  +  Δ is big. Hence Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big] looks more approachable than Conjecture [\ref=conj_F] from the analytic viewpoint (cf. [\cite=dhp-ext]).

As corollaries of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem] and its proof, we can also see the following:

Assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n holds. Let (X,Δ) be an n-dimensional [formula]-factorial projective divisorial log terminal pair such that Δ is a [formula]-divisor. If κ(X,KX  +  Δ)  ≥  1, then (X,Δ) has a good minimal model.

Assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n holds. Let (X,Δ) be an n-dimensional log canonical pair, Δ a [formula]-divisor, and f:X  →  S a proper morphism onto an algebraic variety S. Then the relative log canonical ring

[formula]

is a finitely generated OS-algebra.

If Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]n, then Conjectures [\ref=conj_F], [\ref=conj_F_big], and [\ref=conj_M] hold in any dimension by Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. Unfortunately, Corollary [\ref=cor1] is far from the complete solution of Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]n under Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n. For the details of Conjecture [\ref=conj_M], we recommend the reader to see [\cite=fg3] (see also Section [\ref=sec4]: Appendix).

In [\cite=fujino-surface], the first author solved Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]4. Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]n with n  ≥  5 is widely open. For surfaces, R(X,Δ) is known to be finitely generated under the assumption that Δ is a boundary [formula]-divisor and X is [formula]-factorial. When dim X = 2, we do not have to assume that the pair (X,Δ) is log canonical for the minimal model theory. For the details, see [\cite=fujino-surface].

We will work over [formula], the field of complex numbers, throughout this paper. We will make use of the standard notation as in [\cite=kamama], [\cite=komo], [\cite=bchm], [\cite=fujino-what] and [\cite=fujino-funda].

Preliminaries

In this section, we collect together some definitions and notation.

Let us recall the definition of . In Definition [\ref=real-def-minimalmodelsenseofBS], all the varieties are assumed to be projective.

A pair (Y,ΔY) is a log birational model of (X,Δ) if we are given a birational map [formula] and ΔY  =  Δ~ + E where Δ~ is the birational transform of Δ and E is the reduced exceptional divisor of φ- 1, that is, [formula] where Ej is a prime divisor on Y which is exceptional over X for every j. A log birational model (Y,ΔY) is a nef model of (X,Δ) if in addition

(Y,ΔY) is [formula]-factorial dlt, and

KY  +  ΔY is nef.

And we call a nef model (Y,ΔY) a log minimal model of (X,Δ) in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov if in addition

for any prime divisor D on X which is exceptional over Y, we have

[formula]

Let (Y,ΔY) be a log minimal model of (X,Δ). If KY  +  ΔY is semi-ample, then (Y,ΔY) is called a of (X,Δ).

When (X,Δ) is plt, a log minimal model of (X,Δ) in the sense of Birkar-Shokurov is a log minimal model in the traditional sense (see [\cite=komo] and [\cite=bchm]), that is, [formula] extracts no divisors. For the details, see [\cite=bir-I].

Assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n holds. Let (X,Δ) be a projective [formula]-factorial dlt pair with dim X = n such that KX  +  Δ is pseudo-effective. Then, by [\cite=bir-exiII], there is a sequence of divisorial contractions and flips starting with (X,Δ) and ending up with a good minimal model (Y,ΔY). In particular, [formula] extracts no divisors. Therefore, (Y,ΔY) is a log minimal model of (X,Δ) in the traditional sense.

Proof of Main Theorem

For the proof of the main theorem: Theorem [\ref=main_theorem], we discuss the relationship among the following conjectures:

For the above conjectures, we show the following lemmas:

Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n and Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n  -  1 imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n - 1.

Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n - 1.

Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n and Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n - 1 imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n.

Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1.

Assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1 holds. Let (X,Δ) be an n-dimensional [formula]-factorial projective divisorial log terminal pair such that Δ is a [formula]-divisor and κ(X,KX  +  Δ)  ≥  1. Then (X,Δ) has a good minimal model. In particular, Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1 implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]≤  n.

Let us start the proof of the lemmas.

By taking a dlt blow-up and using Shokurov polytope (cf. [\cite=bir-exiII] and [\cite=fujino-funda]), we may assume that (X,Δ) is a [formula]-factorial dlt pair and that Δ is a [formula]-divisor. Moreover by taking a product with an Abelian variety we may further assume dim X = n - 1. The abundance conjecture follows from [\cite=lazic] and Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n when (X,Δ) is klt. For a log canonical pair (X,Δ) with nef KX  +  Δ, its semi-ampleness follows from [\cite=fg3] by Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n - 1 and the abundance theorem for klt pairs established above.

We may assume dim X = n - 1 by taking a product with an Abelian variety. Let [formula] be a projectively normal embedding. We consider the [formula]-bundle

[formula]

Let f:Y  →  Z be the birational contraction of the negative section E on Y and H a general sufficiently ample [formula]-divisor on Z such that ⌊H⌋ = 0 and KY + E + f*H is big. Set ΔY  =  E + f*H. Without loss of generality, we may assume that (Y,ΔY) is a canonical pair with ⌊E + f*H⌋ = E. By the assumption (Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n), R(Y,ΔY) is finitely generated. Then (Y†,ΔY†), where [formula] and ΔY† is the pushforward of ΔY on Y†, is the log canonical model of (Y,ΔY) (see, for example, [\cite=kamama]). By taking a suitable dlt blow-up of (Y†,ΔY†), we obtain a good minimal model (Y',ΔY') of (Y,ΔY) (cf. [\cite=bir-I]). See also [\cite=bir-exilcflip]. Note that [formula] extracts no divisors since (Y,ΔY) is plt. Moreover, we may assume that this birational map

[formula]

is a composition of (KY  +  ΔY)-flips and (KY  +  ΔY)-divisorial contractions by [\cite=hacon-xu-lc-closure]. We note that E is not contracted by φ. Indeed, if E is contracted, then E is uniruled. However, by [\cite=bdpp], E is not uniruled since KE is pseudo-effective. Note that E≃X. Now we see that KY'  +  ΔY' is semi-ample by the finite generation of R(Y',ΔY'), where ΔY'  =  φ*ΔY. Take a general member D'∈|m(KY'  +  ΔY')| such that [formula] for some sufficiently divisible positive integer m. Then D' induces some effective [formula]-divisor D such that [formula] and [formula]. Thus we can see κ(X,KX) = κ(E,KE)  ≥  0 since

[formula]

Therefore, we obtain Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n - 1.

The following proof is pointed out by the referee:

Let Y, Z and E be as in the above proof of Lemma [\ref=lem4] and let A be an ample Cartier divisor such that OX(1)≃OX(A). Since KX is pseudo-effective, KX + A is big. Let H' be a hyperplane on [formula]. Then we can easily check that

[formula]

Let [formula] be a [formula]-Cartier [formula]-divisor on Z such that [formula] is a general member of |4H'|. Then [formula] is canonical, [formula], and

[formula]

It is easy to see that [formula] is big. Therefore, [formula] is finitely generated by the assumption (Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n). Since OY(E + p*(KX + A)) is the tautological line bundle associated to the [formula]-bundle [formula], the finite generation of [formula] is equivalent to that of

[formula]

By [\cite=cl], this implies that κ(X,KX)  ≥  0 since KX is pseudo-effective and KX + A is big.

This follows from [\cite=dhp-ext] and [\cite=g4]. Note that we can use the ACC theorems in [\cite=hmx].

By [\cite=bir-exiII], it is enough to show Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n  -  1 and Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n  -  1. We show these conjectures by induction on the dimension. Now we assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  d  -  1 and Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  d  -  1 hold for d < n. Note that Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n - 1 holds by Lemma [\ref=lem4]. By Lemma [\ref=lem5], Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  d holds. On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=lem3] and its proof, Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  d holds. Thus we see that Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n  -  1 and Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n  -  1 hold.

By [\cite=bir-exiII], Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n and Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n. This fact was used in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem6]. On the other hand, it is easy to see that Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n and Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n by using dlt blow-ups. See also Remark [\ref=2323].

By [\cite=bir-exiII], we may assume that KX  +  Δ is nef. By [\cite=fukuda-num-eff] (cf. [\cite=kawamata_pluri]), we obtain that KX  +  Δ is abundant, i.e. κ(X,KX  +  Δ) = ν(X,KX  +  Δ), where [formula] is the numerical dimension (see, for example, [\cite=kamama]). Thus we see that KX  +  Δ is semi-ample by [\cite=fg3].

Now we give the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

It is obvious that Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n. By Lemma [\ref=lem6], Conjecture [\ref=conj_F_big]n implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem7], Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1 implies Conjecture [\ref=conj_F]≤  n. Thus we finish the proof of Theorem [\ref=main_theorem].

Finally, we discuss the corollaries. Corollary [\ref=cor0] is contained in Theorem [\ref=main_theorem]. Corollary [\ref=cor1] is a direct consequence of Lemma [\ref=lem6] and Lemma [\ref=lem7]. The proof of [\cite=fujino-f.g.] works for Corollary [\ref=cor2]. Note that [\cite=fujino-f.g.] depends on [\cite=bir-I] and [\cite=fujino-ab]. Now we can use more powerful results in [\cite=bir-exiII] and [\cite=fg3].

We close this section with a remark on [\cite=fm].

Let (X,Δ) be a projective log canonical pair such that Δ is a [formula]-divisor. Let [formula] be the Iitaka fibration with respect to KX  +  Δ. By taking a suitable resolution, we assume that Φ is a morphism, X is smooth, and [formula] is a simple normal crossing divisor on X. Suppose that every log canonical center of (X,Δ) is dominant onto Z. Then R(X,Δ) is finitely generated.

By using a generalization of the semi-positivity theorem (see [\cite=fujino-high] and [\cite=fg-moduli]), we can formulate a canonical bundle formula for log canonical pairs as in [\cite=fm]. By using the canonical bundle formula for log canonical pairs, the proof of [\cite=fm] works for the above setting. We leave the details as exercises for the reader. Note that the finite generation of the log canonical rings for projective klt pairs holds by [\cite=bchm].

Appendix

In this appendix, we discuss Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]. The results in this appendix are essentially contained in [\cite=fg3].

Let us recall the following conjecture (see [\cite=dhp-ext] and [\cite=fg3]).

Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n and Conjecture [\ref=conjG]≤  n imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n.

By induction on the dimension, we may assume that Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n - 1 holds true. Therefore, we obtain Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n - 1 (cf. Remark [\ref=rem36]). Lemma [\ref=lem5], Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n, and Conjecture [\ref=conj_A]≤  n - 1 imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n. Finally, by [\cite=fg3], Conjecture [\ref=conj_N]≤  n and Conjecture [\ref=conjG]≤  n imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n.

We note that, for Theorem [\ref=thma1], it is sufficient to prove Conjecture [\ref=conjG] under the extra assumptions: X is [formula]-factorial, κ(X,KX  +  Δ) = 0, and [formula]. For the details, see the proof of [\cite=fg3].

Conjecture [\ref=conjG] holds true if KX  +  Δ is semi-ample (see [\cite=fg3]). Therefore, Conjecture [\ref=conjG] follows from Conjecture [\ref=conj_A].

In [\cite=dhp-ext], it is assumed that

[formula]

in Conjecture [\ref=conjG].

It is known that the condition κσ(X,KX  +  Δ) = 0 is equivalent to the existence of good minimal models of (X,Δ) (see, for example, [\cite=druel] and [\cite=gongyo-minimal]).

We can easily check the following statement (cf. the proof of [\cite=fg3]).

Conjecture [\ref=conj_N_sm]≤  n and Conjecture [\ref=conjH]≤  n imply Conjecture [\ref=conj_M]≤  n.

We leave the details as exercises for the reader. The proof of Theorem [\ref=thma2] is almost the same as that of Theorem [\ref=thma1].
