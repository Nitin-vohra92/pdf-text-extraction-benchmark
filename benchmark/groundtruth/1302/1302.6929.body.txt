Nonwandering sets of interval skew products

Introduction

Skew products over hyperbolic dynamics or, equivalently, over subshifts of finite type is quite a standard component of the modern theory of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems. A detailed review of this role of skew products can be found, for instance, in our thorough 3-pages introduction to [\cite=Kleptsyn2011].

In [\cite=Kleptsyn2011] which is the prequel to this paper, we started quite an ambitious project to understand such skew products in the case when the fibers are intervals of real line, and the fiber maps are orientation preserving diffeomorphisms. We gave a complete description of possible dynamics for so-called step skew products: such that the dependence of fiber maps on the base coordinate is piecewise constant.

In this sequel we manage to relax the step condition and to extend some of the results of [\cite=Kleptsyn2011] to all skew products. Namely, in Theorem [\ref=t:small] we show that for a residual set of such skew products, the nonwandering set (including all the attractors and repellers) has zero standard measure which is the product of the ergodic invariant measure of the subshift in the base and the Lebesgue measure in the fiber.

For this, we prove a stronger statement which is Theorem [\ref=t:countable]: for any monotone 1-parameter family, for all but countably many parameter values the standard measure of so-called anchored set (which includes the nonwandering set) is zero.

Notations

Let σ:Σ  →  Σ be a transitive subshift of finite type (a topological Markov chain), [formula]. We endow Σ with a metric defined by the formula

[formula]

Fix any σ-invariant ergodic measure μ on Σ.

Let [formula] be a unit interval. In this paper, we will be considering the following class [formula] of skew products F:Σ  ×  I  →  Σ  ×  I:

[formula];

the maps [formula] are orientation preserving C1 diffeomorphisms which send I strictly inside itself;

the map [formula] is continuous.

We equip [formula] with a metric as follows:

[formula]

The standard measure [formula] on Σ  ×  I is the product of Markov measure μ in the base and the Lebesgue measure in the fiber.

Drifting and anchored regions

Following [\cite=Kleptsyn2011], we define drifting graphs and points. Let φi:Σ  →  I be two arbitrary functions, Γi be their graphs, i  =  1,2.

We write φ1  <  φ2 whenever for any [formula]

[formula]

We also write Γ1  <  Γ2 in this case.

A general property of any skew product is that the image F(Γ) of any graph Γ is also a graph of some function.

We say that a graph Γ drifts up (down) if F(Γ)  >  Γ (respectively, F(Γ)  <  Γ).

Recall that we assume the fiber maps [formula] to be monotone increasing. Thus F(Γ)  >  Γ implies Fn + 1(Γ)  >  Fn(Γ) for any [formula], and F(Γ)  <  Γ implies Fn + 1(Γ)  <  Fn(Γ) for any [formula], provided the backward iterates are well-defined. The strip between Fn(Γ) and Fn + 1(Γ) is a fundamental domain for F.

A point p = (ω,x)∈Σ  ×  I drifts up if there exists a continuous map γ:Σ  →  I with the graph Γ such that

Γ drifts up under F;

the point p is between Γ and its image:

[formula]

Denote the set of the points drifting up in F by [formula]. In the same way we define the set of points drifting down which we denote by [formula]. Finally, denote by [formula] the anchored set which is the complement to the points drifting up or down.

For the nonwandering set Ω(F) we always have [formula] because the sets [formula] and [formula] are open and disjoint from Ω(F).

Assume that [formula] for some skew product F. Because the set [formula] is open and the periodic points are dense in Σ, we can pick [formula] such that ω is periodic. Let n be its minimal period. Then Fn(p)  =  (x̄,) belongs to the same fiber as p. Note that if x̄  >  x, then p cannot be drifting down, and if x̄  <  x, then p cannot be drifting up. Thus [formula], and the Proposition is proven.

Now we introduce a partial ordering on the set of mild skew products with an interval fiber:

[formula] whenever for any [formula] we have [formula].

Indeed, for any [formula] we can take Γ that satisfies Definition [\ref=d:point_drifts]. Because [formula], we have F(Γ)  <  (Γ). Thus the same Γ is also valid to show [formula].

The second inclusion is proved in the same way.

A family Fτ, τ∈(τ1,τ2), of skew products is monotone increasing if for any τ1  <  τ2 the skew products Fτ1 and Fτ2 are comparable and [formula].

Main results

We say that a subset of the space of skew products is small if it is closed, nowhere dense, and any continuous monotone family intersects it at a finite number of points.

Combined with Remark [\ref=r:omega], this implies that a generic skew product from S has a nonwandering set of zero standard measure.

In the spirit of the Large Deviations Lemma [\cite=Ilyashenko2008] and the Special Ergodic Theorem [\cite=Ilyashenko2008] which give an estimate of the Hausdorff dimension of "bad" sets in some partially hyperbolic systems, we conjecture the following generalization of Theorem [\ref=t:countable].

First we show that Theorem [\ref=t:countable] implies Theorem [\ref=t:small].

Obviously, [formula], where

[formula]

Let us show that for any [formula] the set [formula] is small. First of all, Theorem [\ref=t:countable] implies that any monotone family intersects [formula] at a finite number of points.

Note that the set of pairs [formula] is an open subset of the Cartesian product of Σ  ×  I and the space of dynamical systems on it. The same is true for [formula]. Thus the set

[formula]

is closed.

Now take any sequence of systems [formula] which converges to F. Assume that [formula] which means [formula]. Take an open cover U of the set [formula] such that [formula]. Because [formula], we have [formula] for all [formula]. Thus [formula]. Then for any [formula] there exists a point [formula], [formula].

Because the set [formula] is compact, we can extract from pn a converging subsequence pnm. Then the subsequence [formula] converges to some (p̃,F), and p̃∉U. But because the set [formula] is closed, we must have [formula]. The contradiction with [formula] proves the Proposition.

Because any monotone family intersects Kε at a finite number of points, the set Kε has empty interior. Thus it is nowhere dense. Theorem [\ref=t:small] is proven.

Proof on Theorem [\ref=t:countable]

A skew product F:Σ  ×  M  →  Σ  ×  M is multistep if the fiber maps [formula] depend only on finitely many positions in [formula].

Denote the set of skew products in [formula] depending on m positions by [formula]. In the same way every continuous function can be approximated by piecewise constant functions in sup -norm, we can C0(Σ,C1(I))-approximate skew products from [formula] by multistep skew products. These approximations can be chosen to be generic in the sense of [\cite=Kleptsyn2011]. It immediately follows from [\cite=Kleptsyn2011] that for any generic multistep skew product G we have [formula].

Take a generic multistep skew product G such that [formula]. Because of the above remark,

[formula]

But [formula] and [formula]. Thus [formula] which proves the Proposition.

Now fix any monotone increasing family Fτ. Denote for brevity [formula], [formula]. Proposition [\ref=p:compare] implies that for any τ1  <  τ2 we have [formula] and [formula]. Also denote

[formula]

Obviously, [formula] and [formula].

Because Fτ is continuous in τ, for any point p the set of parameters [formula] is open. Thus for any [formula] for any small enough δ > 0 we have [formula]. By Proposition [\ref=p:up-down-ni], this implies [formula]. Taking the intersection over all δ  >  0, we have that p does not belong to [formula]. Thus [formula].

Let us now prove [\ref=i:measure]. By Proposition [\ref=p:comparison], for any δ > 0

[formula]

By Proposition [\ref=p:compare], the sets [formula] are monotone increasing in δ. Take the intersection over all δ  >  0 to get

[formula]

Now factor out the term [formula] to get the required [formula].

Now we are ready to complete the

Because [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

This can be rewritten as

[formula]

So [formula] equals to the value of a gap of the monotone increasing function [formula] at the point t  =  τ. Any monotone function has at most countable number of gaps. Moreover, if the function is bounded, then for any fixed [formula] only finitely many of the gaps can be bigger than [formula]. Theorem [\ref=t:countable] is proven.

Finally, we remark that all continuous monotone increasing families Fτ,Gρ such that F0  =  G0 are equivalent in the following sense: for any τ  >  0 there exists ρ  >  0 such that

[formula]

Indeed, one can take [formula], and take ρ  >  0 such that [formula]. Then [formula]. Because this argument is symmetric with respect to switching F and G, the sets [formula] depend only on F0 but not on the choice of a continuous monotone increasing family passing through F0. Thus we could denote them just by [formula], [formula].
