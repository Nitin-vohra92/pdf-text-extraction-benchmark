On coherent systems with fixed determinant

Introduction

Let C be a smooth projective curve of genus g over [formula] and let Jd(C) denote the Jacobian of line bundles on C of degree d. In classical Brill-Noether theory, one considers linear systems (L,V), where L is a line bundle of degree d and V is a linear subspace of H0(C,L) of dimension k. The Brill-Noether locus B(1,d,k) (denoted classically by Wk - 1d) is defined by

[formula]

where h0(L): =  dim H0(L). We write also

[formula]

for the corresponding variety of linear systems (L,V) (this is denoted classically by Gk - 1d). Clearly there is a morphism G(1,d,k)  →  B(1,d,k), whose fibre over V is the Grassmannian (k,h0(L)). We write also

[formula]

a number which is known as the Brill-Noether number or the expected dimension of G(1,d,k).

The main results of the classical theory (see [\cite=acgh]) are most easily stated in terms of G(1,d,k) and are as follows:

every irreducible component of G(1,d,k) has dimension at least β(1,d,k);

G(1,d,k) is smooth of dimension β(1,d,k) at (L,V) if and only if the Petri map [formula], given by multiplication of sections, is injective;

[formula] if [formula];

for general C, G(1,d,k) is empty if β(1,d,k) < 0, smooth of dimension β(1,d,k) if [formula] and irreducible if β(1,d,k) > 0.

These statements together justify the use of the term "expected dimension". The proof of (i) depends on representing B(1,d,k) as a determinantal locus while (ii) is proved by identifying the Zariski tangent space of G(1,d,k) in terms of the Petri map; (iv) is proved by showing that, for general C, the Petri map is injective for every (L,V).

Replacing L by a vector bundle E of rank r, we can define

[formula]

where M(r,d) is the moduli space of stable bundles of rank r and degree d. The pairs (E,V) are now called coherent systems; we can consider the moduli of these either as a stack or as a moduli space with a suitable stability condition (see section [\ref=back] for further details). It turns out that the analogues of (i) and (ii) are true but not those of (iii) and (iv); in particular, the non-emptiness of the moduli space (even for a general curve) is a delicate question which is far from being resolved. However, (iii) and (iv) are true in sufficiently many cases that the number

[formula]

can reasonably be regarded as the expected dimension of the moduli space.

Suppose now that we fix the determinant of E. It then turns out that neither of the arguments indicated above works. The moduli spaces are not determinantal varieties in an obvious way and it has so far not been possible to identify the correct analogue of the Petri map. One exception to this is the case when E has rank 2 and det E = KC, in which case everything works except for (iii), which is not completely solved. For any fixed determinant, one can of course say immediately that every component of the moduli space has dimension at least β(r,d,k) - g, but this is often not best possible.

The situation has changed recently due to work of Osserman [\cite=o1] [\cite=o2]. He has obtained improved lower bounds on the dimension of the moduli stack, which lead to a general conjecture. He gives also some examples in which these bounds are sharp in the sense that there exists a component of the moduli stack of the modified expected dimension. It is the purpose of the present note to give more general examples of this phenomenon.

In section [\ref=back], we define α-stability for coherent systems and review the results on lower bounds for the dimensions of moduli spaces of α-stable coherent systems with fixed determinant. We also formulate a conjecture (Conjecture [\ref=conj]) which is compatible with these results. Section [\ref=summ] contains our main results, which can be summarised by saying that the lower bounds of Conjecture [\ref=conj] are sharp when k  ≤  r + 1. We conclude with some examples in section [\ref=ex].

We work throughout over a smooth projective curve C defined over the complex numbers and denote by KC the canonical line bundle on C.

Lower bounds

We recall that a coherent system on C of type (r,d,k) is a pair (E,V) consisting of a vector bundle E of rank r and degree d and a linear subspace V of H0(E) of dimension k. We shall suppose always that [formula]. For any [formula], the α-slope of (E,V) is defined by

[formula]

The coherent system (E,V) is α-stable (α-semistable) if, for every proper coherent subsystem (F,W) of (E,V),

[formula]

Some necessary conditions for the existence of α-stable coherent systems are

[formula]

There exists a moduli space for α-stable coherent systems of type (r,d,k), which we denote by G(α;r,d,k). As already noted in the introduction, we define the Brill-Noether number (or expected dimension) of G(α;r,d,k) by

[formula]

We then have

every irreducible component of G(α;r,d,k) has dimension at least β(r,d,k);

G(α;r,d,k) is smooth of dimension β(r,d,k) at (E,V) if and only if the Petri map [formula], given by multiplication of sections, is injective.

(For these and many other facts about coherent systems and their moduli, see [\cite=BGMN] [\cite=BGMMN1] [\cite=BGMMN2].)

Now suppose we fix the determinant L of E and define moduli spaces G(α;r,L,k). These are closed subschemes of G(α;r,d,k), where deg L = d.

Every irreducible component X of G(α;r,L,k) has dimension

[formula]

This follows at once from (i) above.

It is easy to see that this estimate is not always best possible. Consider, for instance, the trivial case r = 1. Then G(α;r,L,k) is just the Grassmannian (k,h0(L)), which has dimension

[formula]

whenever it is non-empty.

A more significant example is given by the case r = 2, L = KC.

Every irreducible component X of the moduli space G(α;2,KC,k) has dimension

[formula]

Moreover, if C is general, G(α;2,KC,k) is smooth of precisely the dimension given by [\eqref=kc] at (E,V) whenever E is semistable.

Let (E,V)∈G(α;2,KC,k) and let S denote the image of [formula] in S2H0(E). The infinitesimal behaviour of G(α;2,KC,k) at (E,V) is governed by the modified Petri map S  →  H0(S2E). It follows (compare [\cite=he]) that every irreducible component of G(α;2,KC,k) through (E,V) has dimension at least

[formula]

Since deg KC = 2g - 2, this gives [\eqref=kc]. Moreover, G(α;2,KC,k) is smooth of precisely the dimension given by [\eqref=kc] if and only if the modified Petri map is injective. This is shown to hold when C is general and E is semistable in [\cite=te1].

Based on these results, it is reasonable to make the following conjecture.

Every irreducible component X of G(α;r,L,k) has dimension

[formula]

We have already seen that this conjecture holds for k < r by Proposition [\ref=prop1], r = 1 by [\eqref=r=1] and r = 2, L = KC by Proposition [\ref=prop2]. It has recently been proved by Osserman [\cite=o1] that it holds also when r = 2 and [formula]. In [\cite=o2], Osserman proves further that [\eqref=conjeq] holds for any component of G(α;r,L,k) passing through (E,V) in the following cases.

k = r, V not contained in a subbundle of E of rank r - 2;

k = r + 1, h1(L) = 1, no r-dimensional subspace of V contained in a subbundle of E of rank r - 2;

r = 3, k = 5 or 6, h1(L) = 1, no subspace of V of dimension 2 contained in a line subbundle of E.

Note that the first case here proves the conjecture completely when k = r = 2. In general, however, Osserman notes that some non-degeneracy condition is required. He works in terms of stacks and proves that, for any r, k and L, there is an open substack of the moduli stack for which the bound of the conjecture holds; the problem is to describe this open substack, which a priori may even be empty [\cite=o2]. In view of Osserman's examples, it remains possible that α-stability is a sufficient non-degeneracy condition, so that the conjecture in the form stated above remains open. Some evidence for this is provided in the next section.

Regarding the sharpness of the bound in Conjecture [\ref=conj], Teixidor [\cite=te2] has shown that, for a general curve and r = 2, the bound [\eqref=naive] is sharp for B(r,d,k) if d  ≤  k + 2g - 2 and d is sufficiently large compared with k ([formula] if k is even, [formula] if k is odd). If we work in terms of coherent systems, the condition d  ≤  k + 2g - 2 is not required. Moreover, Osserman has proved sharpness for k = r = 2 [\cite=o2].

Sharpness of the bounds

Let us fix integers [formula], [formula] and a line bundle L of degree d > 0. Within the allowable range [\eqref=nec] for the existence of α-stable coherent systems, there are finitely many critical values

[formula]

such that the stability conditions change only as α passes through a critical value [\cite=BGMN]. We write

Gi(r,L,k): = G(α;r,L,k) for αi  <  α  <  αi + 1;

GL(r,L,k): = G(α;r,L,k) for allowable α  >  αL;

G0(r,L,k): = G(α;r,L,k) for 0 < α  <  α1.

We shall be primarily concerned here with GL(r,L,k), but will make deductions for other Gi(r,L,k) and for the Brlll-Noether locus B(r,L,k) when possible.

For completeness, we begin with the "trivial" cases g = 0 and g = 1.

Suppose g = 0 or 1. Then Gi(r,L,k) is irreducible of dimension β(r,d,k) - g whenever it is non-empty.

For g = 0, this follows at once from [\cite=lng0]; for g = 1, one needs to check that the proof of [\cite=lng1] remains valid when the determinant is fixed.

Suppose [formula], k < r and d  ≥  k - (g - 1)(r - k). Then GL(r,L,k) is non-empty and irreducible of dimension

[formula]

Moreover, GL(r,L,k) contains a Zariski open subset which is isomorphic to a fibration over M(r - k,L) with fibre (k,d + (g - 1)(r - k)).

We know from [\cite=bg] (see also [\cite=BGMN]) that G(α;r,L,k) contains a Zariski open subset which is isomorphic to a fibration over M(r - k,d) with fibre (k,d + (g - 1)(r - k)). Restricting this fibration to M(r - k,L), we obtain the last part of the statement and also the fact that GL(r,L,k) is non-empty if d  ≥  k - (g - 1)(r - k) and has an irreducible component of dimension β(r,d,k) - g. Moreover, the general point (E,V) of this component can be written in the form

[formula]

where F∈M(r - k,L). In view of [\eqref=naive], to complete the proof it is sufficient to show that the coherent systems (E,V) which are expressible in the form [\eqref=tf] with F strictly semistable and of determinant L depend on fewer than β(r,d,k) - g parameters. This is a simple counting exercise (see for example [\cite=BGMMN1], noting that, in [\cite=BGMMN1], one needs to subtract g from the formula to take account of the fixing of the determinant).

Under the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm1], suppose further that L is a general line bundle of degree d. Then, for general (E,V)∈GL(r,L,k), the bundle E is stable and [formula] for all i.

Let (E,V)∈GL(r,d,k) be general. By [\cite=BGMMN1], the bundle E is stable and hence (E,V)∈Gi(r,d,k) for all i. Under the assumption that L is general, the result follows from this fact and the theorem.

Suppose [formula], d  ≥  r + 1 and L possesses a section with distinct zeroes. Then GL(r,L,r) is non-empty and irreducible of dimension

[formula]

Note that, by Bertini's Theorem, the hypothesis on L is satisfied whenever L is generated.

According to the proof of [\cite=BGMN], every (E,V)∈GL(r,L,r) can be expressed as a sequence

[formula]

where T is a torsion sheaf whose underlying divisor is the divisor of a section of L. For fixed T, the dimension of the corresponding subspace of GL(r,L,r) is

[formula]

(note that the centraliser of (E,V) in [formula] is [formula]). The family of possible T is irreducible of dimension h0(L) - 1, so GL(r,L,r) is irreducible (if it is non-empty) of dimension

[formula]

It remains to prove that GL(r,L,r) is non-empty. For this, choose T = OD, where D is the divisor of a section of L with d distinct zeroes [formula]. An element of [formula] is then given by [formula] with ξi∈V. Choose ξi so that any subset of r of these vectors is linearly independent. It is shown in the proof of [\cite=BGMN] that the corresponding coherent system (E,V) belongs to GL(r,d,r). This completes the proof.

Under the hypotheses of Theorem [\ref=thm2], suppose further that L is a general line bundle of degree d. Then, for general (E,V)∈GL(r,L,r), the bundle E is stable and (E,V)∈GLi(r,d,r) for all i.

The proof is the same as for Corollary [\ref=cortf].

Suppose [formula] and L is generated with h0(L)  ≥  r + 1. Then there exists a unique component GL of GL(r,L,r + 1) for which the general point (E,V) is generated. Moreover

[formula]

The generated coherent systems (E,V) with det E = L form an open subset U of GL(r,L,r + 1); we need to show that U is irreducible and of the required dimension.

In fact, given such (E,V), we have an exact sequence

[formula]

Dualising, we obtain

[formula]

Hence L is generated by V* and, since h0(E*) = 0 (see, for example, [\cite=BGMMN1]), V*  ⊂  H0(L). Conversely, given V*  ⊂  H0(L) of dimension r + 1 and generating L, the sequences [\eqref=dual] and [\eqref=gen] define a coherent system (E,V)∈U (for the stability of (E,V), see [\cite=BGMN]). Hence U is isomorphic to some non-empty open subset of (r + 1,H0(L)). This proves irreducibility of U and gives dim U = (r + 1)(h0(L) - r - 1). The Riemann-Roch Theorem and the formula for β(r,d,r + 1) now give the result.

We recall that a Petri curve is a curve C for which the Petri map

[formula]

is injective for all line bundles L on C. A good description of GL(r,d,r + 1) is known only when C is Petri (see [\cite=BGMN] and [\cite=bbn]). In this case, it is known that, if β(r,d,r + 1) > 0, then GL(r,d,r + 1) is irreducible (and smooth) of dimension β(r,d,r + 1). It is then sensible to ask whether GL(r,L,r + 1) is irreducible (and hence GL(r,L,r + 1) = GL). Note that β(r,d,r + 1) = β(1,d,r + 1) and, if C is Petri, then, by classical Brill-Noether theory, B(1,d,r + 1) is irreducible if β(1,d,r + 1) > 0 and is a finite set if β(r,d,r + 1) = 0.

Suppose that C is a Petri curve, 0  ≤  β(r,d,r + 1)  ≤  g and L∈B(1,d,r + 1) is general. (If β(r,d,r + 1) = 0, L can be any element of the finite set B(1,d,r + 1).) Then GL(r,L,r + 1) = GL and consists of a single element (E0,V0). Moreover E0 is stable and (E0,V0)∈Gi(r,L,k) for all i.

We have β(1,d,r + 1) = β(r,d,r + 1), so the condition on β(r,d,r + 1) implies that h0(L) = r + 1 and we must take V* = H0(L) in [\eqref=dual]; so GL is a single point. If (E,V)∈GL(r,L,r + 1) is not generated, let E' be the subsheaf of E generated by V. Then H0(E'*) = 0 by [\cite=bbn] and det E' = L( - D) for some effective divisor of degree t > 0. Applying [\eqref=gen] to (E',V) and dualising, we obtain h0(L( - D))  ≥  r + 1, contradicting the fact that L is generated with h0(L) = r + 1. So GL(r,L,r + 1) = GL. The fact that E0 is stable is proved in [\cite=but] or [\cite=bp] and it follows at once that (E0,V0)∈Gi(r,L,k) for all i.

Examples

We have proved sharpness of the bound [\eqref=conjeq] for k  ≤  r + 1 under a mild generality condition on L. The following example shows that some such condition is necessary.

Our second example, also noted by Osserman [\cite=o2], shows that, for k = r + 2, something more is required.
