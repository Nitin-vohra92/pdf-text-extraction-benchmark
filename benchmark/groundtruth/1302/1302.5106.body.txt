Diagonals of self-adjoint operators with finite spectrum

Introduction

The classical Schur-Horn theorem [\cite=horn] [\cite=schur] characterizes diagonals of self-adjoint (Hermitian) matrices with given eigenvalues. It can be stated as follows, where HN is N dimensional Hilbert space over [formula] or [formula], i.e., [formula] or [formula].

Let {λi}Ni = 1 and {di}Ni = 1 be real sequences in nonincreasing order. There exists a self-adjoint operator E:HN  →  HN with eigenvalues {λi} and diagonal {di} if and only of

[formula]

The necessity of [\eqref=horn1] is due to Schur [\cite=schur] and the sufficiency of [\eqref=horn1] is due to Horn [\cite=horn]. It should be noted that [\eqref=horn1] can be stated in the equivalent convexity condition

[formula]

This characterization has attracted a significant interest and has been generalized in many remarkable ways. Some major milestones are the Kostant convexity theorem [\cite=ko] and the convexity of moment mappings in symplectic geometry [\cite=at] [\cite=gs1] [\cite=gs2]. Moreover, the problem of extending Theorem [\ref=horn] to an infinite dimensional dimensional Hilbert space H has attracted a great deal of interest.

Neumann [\cite=neu] gave an infinite dimensional version of the Schur-Horn theorem phrased in terms of [formula]-closure of the convexity condition [\eqref=horn2]. Neumann's result can be considered an initial, albeit somewhat crude, solution of this problem. The first fully satisfactory progress was achieved by Kadison. In his influential work [\cite=k1] [\cite=k2] Kadison discovered a characterization of diagonals of orthogonal projections acting on H. The work by Gohberg and Markus [\cite=gm] and Arveson and Kadison [\cite=ak] extended the Schur-Horn Theorem [\ref=horn] to positive trace class operators. This has been further extended to compact positive operators by Kaftal and Weiss [\cite=kw]. These results are stated in terms of majorization inequalities as in [\eqref=horn1]. Other notable progress includes the work of Arveson [\cite=a] on diagonals of normal operators with finite spectrum. Moreover, Antezana, Massey, Ruiz, and Stojanoff [\cite=amrs] refined the results of Neumann [\cite=neu], and Argerami and Massey [\cite=am] [\cite=am2] studied extensions to II1 factors. For a detailed survey of recent progress on infinite Schur-Horn majorization theorems and their connections to operator ideals we refer to the paper of Kaftal and Weiss [\cite=kw0].

The authors [\cite=mbjj] have recently shown a variant of the Schur-Horn theorem for a class of locally invertible self-adjoint operators on H. This result was used to characterize sequences of norms of a frame with prescribed lower and upper frame bounds. The second author [\cite=jj] has extended Kadison's result [\cite=k1] [\cite=k2] to characterize the set of diagonals of operators with three points in the spectrum. In this work we shall continue this line of research by giving a characterization of diagonals of self-adjoint operators with finite spectrum. Unlike [\cite=jj] we shall only consider a characterization which neglects multiplicities of eigenvalues. The investigation of the corresponding problem for operators with prescribed multiplicities is postponed to a future paper.

Our main result can be thought as an analogue of the work by Arveson [\cite=a] who identified some necessary conditions which must be satisfied by diagonals of normal operators with finite spectrum. Unlike [\cite=a] our main result deals only with self-adjoint operators. On the other hand, Theorem [\ref=npt] gives a complete characterization of diagonals of self-adjoint operators with finite spectrum.

Let {Aj}n + 1j = 0 be an increasing sequence of real numbers such that A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B, [formula]. Let {di}i∈I be a sequence in

[formula]

),andthereexistN, , N ∈andk∈[formula]r=1,, n[formula]

We remark that the assumption that [formula] is not a true limitation of Theorem [\ref=npt]. Indeed, the summable case [formula], or its symmetric variant [formula], leads to a finite rank Schur-Horn theorem which is discussed below. This case requires a different set of conditions which are closely related to the classical Schur-Horn majorization. Finally, the assumption A0 = 0 is made only for simplicity; the general case follows immediately by a translation argument.

Preliminaries

The Schur-Horn theorem and its extensions [\cite=ak] [\cite=kw] are usually stated with eigenvalues in nonincreasing order. This is because positive diagonal entries can be easily arranged into a nonincreasing sequence indexed by [formula], or a finite subset. In particular, we have the following result for finite rank positive operators which can be deduced from results in [\cite=ak] [\cite=kw], see also [\cite=mbjj]. The main innovation in the formulation of Theorem [\ref=horn-ninc] is that it does not require a sequence {di} to be globally nonincreasing. This allows the possibility that {di} has infinitely many positive terms and some zero terms. At the same time it also gives us flexibility in arranging small diagonal terms.

Let {λi}Ni = 1 be a positive nonincreasing sequence. Let {di}∞i = 1 be a nonnegative sequence such that:

di  ≤  dN for i  ≥  N + 1,

the subsequence {di}Ni = 1 is nonincreasing.

There exists a positive rank N operator E on a Hilbert space H with (positive) eigenvalues {λi}Ni = 1 and diagonal {di}∞i = 1 if and only if

[formula]

Observe that [\eqref=frmaj1] is simply an equivalent way of writing the majorization condition

[formula]

If we insist on arranging diagonal entries into a nondecreasing sequence, then we should instead use [formula] as part of the index set. This seemingly trivial observation leads to the following reformulation of Theorem [\ref=horn-ninc] with eigenvalues in nondecreasing order which, as we shall see, has non-trivial consequences.

Let {λi}Ni = 1 be a positive nondecreasing sequence. Let {di}Ni =  -   ∞ be a nonnegative sequence such that:

di  ≤  d1 for i  ≤  0,

the subsequence {di}Ni = 1 is nondecreasing.

There exists a positive rank N operator E on a Hilbert space H with (positive) eigenvalues {λi}Ni = 1 and diagonal {di}Ni =  -   ∞ if and only if

[formula]

We will make an extensive use of Kadison's theorem [\cite=k1] [\cite=k2] which characterizes diagonals of orthogonal projections. Theorem [\ref=Kadison] serves as a prototype for our Theorem [\ref=npt]. The common feature of both of these results is a trace condition. The main distinction between them is a lack of majorization inequalities in Kadison's Theorem which are present in Theorem [\ref=npt].

Let {di}i∈I be a sequence in

[formula]

Note that if there exists a partition of [formula] such that

[formula]

then for all α∈(0,1) we have C(α) <   ∞   and D(α) <   ∞   and

[formula]

Thus, in the presence of a partition satisfying [\eqref=partition],

[formula]

is a necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence to the be the diagonal of a projection. We will find use for these more general partitions in the sequel.

Finally, the following "moving toward 0-1" lemma plays a key role in our arguments. Lemma [\ref=movelemma] is simply a concatenation of [\cite=mbjj] stated in a convenient form.

Let {di}i∈I be a sequence in

[formula]

satisfying

[formula]

(ii) For any self-adjoint operator [formula] on H with diagonal [formula], there exists an operator E on H unitarily equivalent to [formula] with diagonal {di}i∈I.

Necessity of interior majorization

In this section we will show the necessity in Theorem [\ref=npt]. In order to do this it is convenient to formalize the concept of interior majorization with the following definition.

Let {Aj}n + 1j = 0 be an increasing sequence such that A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B, [formula]. Let {di}i∈I be a sequence in

[formula]

Despite its initial appearance, the interior majorization conditions [\eqref=fulltrace1] and [\eqref=fullmaj1] are equivalent with [\eqref=npttrace] and [\eqref=nptmaj] in Theorem [\ref=npt]. Indeed, by Remark [\ref=rpart], [\eqref=fulltrace1] is equivalent to the statement that for all α∈(0,B) there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

Fix α  =  Ar, where [formula]. Then, [\eqref=fullmaj1] can be rewritten as

[formula]

Using [\eqref=fulltrace2], we can remove the presence of k = k(α) in [\eqref=fullmaj2] to obtain

[formula]

This is precisely [\eqref=nptmaj], and the above process is reversible.

Let E be a self-adjoint operator on H with spectrum

[formula]

where {Aj}n + 1j = 0 is an increasing sequence such that A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B, [formula]. Let di  =  〈Eei,ei〉 be a diagonal of E with respect to some orthonormal basis {ei}i∈I of H. Assume that for some 0 < α < B, C(α) <   ∞   and D(α) <   ∞  . Then, {di}i∈I satisfies interior majorization by {Aj}n + 1j = 0.

By the spectral decomposition, we can write

[formula]

where Pj's are mutually orthogonal projections satisfying [formula]. Let p(j)i  =  〈Pjei,ei〉 be the diagonal of Pj. Hence, we have

[formula]

For convenience let I0  =  {i∈I:di  <  α} and I1  =  {i∈I:di  ≥  α}. By our assumption

[formula]

Summing [formula] over i∈I0 yields

[formula]

Using [\eqref=tt10] we have that [formula]. Summing this over i∈I1 yields

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=tt11] and [\eqref=tt12] and applying Theorem [\ref=Kadison] yields

[formula]

Moreover, since [formula] by [\eqref=tt12] we have

[formula]

By [\eqref=tt11], [\eqref=tt14], Theorem [\ref=Kadison] and Remark [\ref=rpart] applied to the projection Pn + 1 we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

For convenience we let qi = p(n + 1)i. In particular, by letting α = An the above shows [\eqref=fulltrace1] with k0 = a - b, where

[formula]

It remains to show the interior majorization inequality [\eqref=fullmaj1].

Fix [formula], and let I0  =  {i:di < Ar} and I1  =  {i:di  ≥  Ar}. By the fact that k0 = a - b, we have

[formula]

Thus, the required majorization [\eqref=fullmaj1] is equivalent to

[formula]

By [\eqref=tt13], we have for [formula],

[formula]

Thus, [\eqref=int4] can be rewritten as

[formula]

Since {Aj} is an increasing sequence, the left hand side of [\eqref=int5] is ≥  0. On the other hand, the right hand side of [\eqref=int5] is ≤  0 as it is dominated by

[formula]

In the last step we used [\eqref=tt10]. This shows [\eqref=int5], which implies [\eqref=int4], thus proving [\eqref=fullmaj1]. This completes the proof of Theorem [\ref=int-nec].

Sufficiency of interior majorization

The goal of this section is to show the sufficiency in Theorem [\ref=npt]. The sufficiency of condition (i), that is C(B / 2) + D(B / 2) =   ∞  , is a consequence of a result established by the second author, see [\cite=jj].

Let {Aj}n + 1j = 0 be an increasing sequence such that A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B, [formula]. Assume {di}i∈I is a sequence in

[formula]

Next, we must demonstrate the sufficiency of condition (ii) of Theorem [\ref=npt]. To achieve this we shall introduce an alternative variant of interior majorization which allows us to apply Theorems [\ref=horn-ninc] and [\ref=horn-ndec] in the crucial case when {di} can be indexed in nondecreasing order by [formula].

Suppose that [formula] and {Aj}n + 1j = 0 is an increasing sequence in [formula] such that A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B. Let [formula] be a nondecreasing sequence which takes values in [formula], each at least once. Let [formula] be a nondecreasing sequence in

[formula]

Since {λi} is takes values 0 and B and is nondecreasing, there exist [formula] such that λi = 0 for all i < i0 and λi = B for all i > iB.

To distinguish between two distinct types of interior majorization we shall frequently refer to the concept introduced in Definition [\ref=mar] as Lebesgue interior majorization. This is done purposefully as an analogy between Riemann and Lebesgue integrals. Theorem [\ref=eqmajs] shows the equivalence of the concepts of Riemann and Lebesgue interior majorization for nondecreasing sequences.

Let {Aj}n + 1j = 0 be an increasing sequence in [formula] with A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B. Let [formula] be a nondecreasing sequence in

[formula]

We need to set some notation first. Without loss of generality we may assume that di < A1 [formula] i  ≤  0. For [formula], we set

[formula]

With this notation for [formula], we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Finally, given [formula], we set

[formula]

Assume that {di} satisfies either Riemann or Lebesgue interior majorization by {Aj}n + 1j = 0. In the first case we let Nj  =  |{i:λi  =  Ar}| and we fix [formula] such that

[formula]

In the second case we let {Nj}nj = 1 and [formula] be as in [\eqref=fulltrace1] and [\eqref=fullmaj1]. In either case we have

[formula]

First, we will show the equivalence of [\eqref=fulltrace1] with [\eqref=rmaj2]. For m > σn + k we have

[formula]

By [\eqref=rmaj3], for m > mn

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=rmaj4] and [\eqref=rmaj5] for m >  max {σn + k,mn} yields

[formula]

Since the last series converges, by letting m  →    ∞  , [\eqref=rmaj2] is equivalent with [\eqref=fulltrace1] with k0 = mn  -  σn - k.

Next, we will show the equivalence of [\eqref=fullmaj1] with [\eqref=rmaj1]. Assume that Lebesgue interior majorization holds. In the current notation, [\eqref=fullmaj1] takes the following form

[formula]

We must demonstrate that δm  ≥  0 for all [formula]. Since di  ≥  0  =  λi for i  ≤  k, we have δm  ≥  0 for m  ≤  k. Moreover, since di  -  λi = di - B  ≤  0 for all i > σn + k and δm  →  0 as m  →    ∞  , this implies δm  ≥  0 for all m > σn + k.

We will prove by induction on [formula] that δm  ≥  0 for [formula]. The base case r = 0 was shown above. Assume the inductive hypothesis is true for r - 1, where 1  ≤  r  ≤  n. We will show that that δm  ≥  0 for all [formula]. There are two cases to consider.

Case 1. Assume that mr  ≤  k + σr. First we will show that δmr  ≥  0. If mr  ≤  k + σr - 1, then the inductive hypothesis implies that δmr  ≥  0, so we may assume k + σr - 1 + 1  ≤  mr  ≤  k + σr. Using [\eqref=rmaj6] and then [\eqref=rmaj8]

[formula]

This shows that δmr  ≥  0.

By [\eqref=rmaja] and [\eqref=rmaj8]

[formula]

Combining this with δmr  ≥  0 implies that δm  ≥  0 for all [formula].

Case 2. Assume mr > k + σr. Using [\eqref=rmaj6] and then [\eqref=rmaja]

[formula]

By [\eqref=rmaja] and [\eqref=rmaj8], di  -  λi  <  Ar  -  λi = 0 for all k + σr - 1 + 1  ≤  i  ≤  k + σr Combining this with δk + σr  ≥  0 implies that δm  ≥  0 for all [formula]. This completes the inductive step and shows [\eqref=rmaj1].

Conversely, assume that {di} satisfies Riemann interior majorization. We must show that [\eqref=rmaj6] holds for each [formula]. Suppose that k + σr  ≥  mr. Using δmr  ≥  0 and the fact that λi  ≤  Ar for i  ≤  k + σr, we have

[formula]

Next suppose that k + σr < mr. Using δmr  ≥  0 and the fact λi  ≥  Ar + 1 > Ar for i  ≥  k + σr + 1, we have

[formula]

This proves that {di} satisfies interior majorization as in Definition [\ref=mar].

The next result gives the crucial sufficiency of Riemann interior majorization for the existence of a self-adjoint operator with finite spectrum and prescribed diagonal. For nondecreasing sequences ordered by [formula], the necessity of Riemann interior majorization follows by combining Theorems [\ref=int-nec] and [\ref=eqmajs].

Let {Aj}n + 1j = 0 be an increasing sequence in [formula] with A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B. Let [formula] be a nondecreasing sequence in

[formula]

Let [formula] be the sequence [\eqref=rmaj8] as in Definition [\ref=rim]. By possibly shifting both sequences {di} and {λi} we may assume without loss of generality that λi is given by [\eqref=rmaj8] with k = 0, that is λi = 0 [formula] i  ≤  0 and λi = B [formula] i  ≥  σ + 1 for σ  =  |{i:λi  ≠  0,B}|.

The special case when there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

follows directly from Theorem [\ref=horn-ndec] applied to the sequences {λi}i0i = 1 and {di}i0i =  -   ∞ with i0  ≥  σ. Moreover, by the symmetry considerations, as explained later in Case 3, one can also deal with the reciprocal case when

[formula]

Thus, without loss of generality we can assume that neither [\eqref=srimB] nor [\eqref=srim0] holds, and since {di} is nondecreasing we have di∈(0,B) for all [formula]. For convenience we note that by [\eqref=rmaj2] for any [formula] we have

[formula]

Fix an integer m0∈[0,σ] such that

[formula]

Obviously, δm0  ≤   min {δ0,δσ}. The proof of Theorem [\ref=srim] splits into three cases.

Case 1. δm0  <   min {δ0,δσ}. There are finite subsets [formula] and [formula] such that

[formula]

In subcase 2 we assume that there exists a finite set [formula] such that

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

which implies that

[formula]

From [\eqref=maj2a] we see that if subcase 2 fails, then we must have [formula] and we are in subcase 1.

First, assume we are in subcase 1. If I0 is finite, then [formula] and the sequence [formula], consisting of |I0| zeros and {λi}σi = 1, satisfy majorization property of the Schur-Horn Theorem [\ref=horn] (after reversing indexing). If I0 is infinite, then the assumption that {di} is nondecreasing guarantees that the assumptions of Theorem [\ref=horn-ndec] are also met. The fact that di's for i  ≤  0 are indexed by I0 does not cause any problem here since one can temporarily reindex {di}i∈I0 into {di}0i =  -   ∞. Therefore, either Theorem [\ref=horn] or Theorem [\ref=horn-ndec] implies that there is a positive rank σ operator E0 with diagonal [formula] and spectrum [formula]. We shall establish that a similar conclusion holds in subcase 2 albeit with appropriately modified diagonal terms.

Next, we assume we are in subcase 2. Set

[formula]

Observe that

[formula]

The strict inequality above is a consequence of our assumption that [\eqref=srim0] fails. Hence, there is a finite set [formula]. By [\eqref=rsim11] and [\eqref=srimC] we have

[formula]

By Theorem [\ref=Kadison] there is a projection [formula] such that [formula] has diagonal [formula]. Since [formula] for i  ≥  σ + 1 we see that σ(BP)  =  {0,B}. Consequently, [formula] has the desired spectrum and the diagonal [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=movelemma] (ii) there is an operator E which is unitarily equivalent to [formula] with diagonal [formula]. This completes the proof of Case 2.

Case 3. δm0  =  δ0  ≤  δσ. Define the sequences d'i = B - d- i + σ + 1 and λ'i = B - λ- i + σ + 1 for all [formula]. One can verify that {d'i} satisfies Riemann interior majorization by {B - A- j + n + 1}n + 1j = 0. With this modification the sequence {d'i} satisfies the requirements of Case 2. Hence, there exists an operator E' with the spectrum [formula] and diagonal {d'i}. Therefore, the operator E: = B - E' has the desired properties. This completes the proof of Case 3 and Theorem [\ref=srim].

By combining Theorems [\ref=eqmajs] and [\ref=srim] we can show the sufficiency of the Lebesgue interior majorization. In essence, we still need to deal with sequences which satisfy Lebesgue interior majorization, but do not conform to more restrictive Riemann interior majorization. Theorem [\ref=inthorn] shows the sufficiency of Theorem [\ref=npt].

Let {Aj}n + 1j = 0 be an increasing sequence in [formula] with A0 = 0 and An + 1 = B. Let {di}i∈I be a sequence in

[formula]

Set J: = {i∈I:di∈(0,B)} and Jλ: = {i:di  =  λ} for λ = 0,B. Let [formula] be the identity operator on a space of dimension |JB| and let [formula] be the zero operator on a space of dimension |J0|. Since C(B / 2) <   ∞   and D(B / 2) <   ∞  , the only possible limit points of {di}i∈J are 0 and B. The argument breaks into four cases depending on the number of limit points.

Case 1: Assume both 0 and B are limit points of the sequence {di}i∈J. This implies that there is a bijection [formula] such that [formula] is in nondecreasing order. Since {di}i∈J still satisfies interior majorization, by Theorem [\ref=eqmajs] the sequence [formula] satisfies Riemann interior majorization. By Theorem [\ref=srim] there is a self-adjoint operator E' with diagonal {di}i∈J and [formula]. The operator [formula] is as desired. This completes the proof of Case 1.

Case 2: Assume 0 is the only limit point of {di}i∈J. Since [formula] we must have |JB| =   ∞  . There is a bijection [formula] such that [formula] is in nondecreasing order. The sequence {dπ(i)}i∈Z satisfies interior majorization by {Aj}n + 1j = 0, and Theorem [\ref=eqmajs] implies that it also satisfies Riemann interior majorization by {Aj}n + 1j = 0. By Theorem [\ref=srim] there is a self-adjoint operator E0 with diagonal [formula] and [formula]. The operator [formula] has the same spectrum and diagonal {di}. This completes the proof of Case 2.

Case 3: Assume B is the only limit point of {di}i∈J. The proof of this case follows by an obvious modification of Case 2.

Case 4: Assume {di}i∈J has no limit points. This implies that J is finite and since [formula] we also have |J0| = |JB| =   ∞  . There is a bijection [formula] so that [formula] is nondecreasing. Theorem [\ref=eqmajs] implies that {dπ(i)} satisfies Riemann interior majorization by {Aj}n + 1j = 0. Theorem [\ref=srim] implies that there is a self-adjoint operator E with diagonal {dπ(i)} and [formula]. This completes the proof of Case 4 and the theorem.

We end the paper by demonstrating the use of Theorem [\ref=npt] in the following example.

Consider the sequence

[formula]

By Kadison's Theorem [\ref=Kadison] there does not exist a projection with diagonal {di}. However, in [\cite=jj] it was shown that the set of possible 3 point spectra of operators with the diagonal {di}

[formula]

consists of exactly 7 points {1 / 8,1 / 6,1 / 4,1 / 2,3 / 4,5 / 6,7 / 8}. With the help of Mathematica and the characterization from Theorem [\ref=npt] we can find the corresponding set of possible 4 point spectra of operators. The following figure shows the set
