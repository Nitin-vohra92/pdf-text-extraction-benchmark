Bi-Lipschitz A-equivalence of K-equivalent map-germs

Introduction

The classification problem of generic singularities of C∞ mappings up to C∞ coordinate transformations is one of the most important problems in Singularity Theory. However, since it is impossible to obtain countably many list on this problem, the classification of singularities of C∞ mappings by weaker equivalence relations are often studied. The Cr A-equivalence (0  ≤  r  <    ∞  ) has been well-studied. The bi-Lipschitz A-equivalence is also one of the weaker equivalence relations and the classification problem with respect to bi-Lipschitz A-equivalence is an interesting subject in the recent development of metric singularity theory (see for instance [\cite=costasaiasoares] [\cite=fernandesruas] [\cite=fernandessoares] [\cite=henryparusinski]). In this paper we give sufficient conditions for the bi-Lipschitz A-equivalence of K-equivalent map-germs, providing Lipschitz versions of results with respect to the Cr A-equivalence given in [\cite=nishimuralondon] [\cite=nishimuratopology] where 0  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  .

A map [formula] is said to be Lipschitz if there exists a constant c  >  0 such that the following holds, where U is an open set of [formula].

[formula]

A Lipschitz map [formula] is called a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism if n = p and φ has a Lipschitz inverse. Two C∞ map-germs [formula] are said to be bi-Lipschitz A-equivalent if there exist germs of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that [formula].

Let [formula] be a C∞ map-germ. Any C∞ map-germ [formula] such that Φ(x,0) = f(x) is called a C∞ deformation-germ of f.

Let [formula] be a C∞ map-germ. A C∞ deformation-germ [formula] of f is said to be Lipschitz trivial if there exist L-stratifications in the sense of [\cite=mostowski] [\cite=parusinski] [\cite=parusinski2], S of [formula], T of [formula] and [formula] of [formula] such that the following three conditions are satisfied:

The map-germ [formula] is a stratified map with respect to S and T, where [formula] is the canonical projection.

The canonical projection [formula] is a stratified map with respect to T and [formula].

There exist germs of stratified Lipschitz vector fields [formula] at the origin in [formula] with respect to S and [formula] at the origin in [formula] with respect to T such that

[formula]

where [formula] is the trivial vector field of [formula] with respect to the i-th coordinate function λi of the standard coordinate neighborhood [formula].

Definition [\ref=def1] was motivated by the definition of Thom trivial deformation given by Nishimura in [\cite=nishimuralondon]. A deformation is Thom trivial if there exists a C-regular stratification in the sense of K. Bekka ([\cite=bekka]), satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above where (Φ,π) is a Thom map. For any Thom trivial deformation we can apply Thom's second isotopy lemma ([\cite=bekka] [\cite=gibsonetall] [\cite=matherhowto] [\cite=duplessiswall]) which implies that (Φ,π) is topologically equivalent to (f,π). To obtain a similar condition to that for the Lispchitz case, we replace C-regular stratifications by L-stratifications (in the sense of Mostowski [\cite=mostowski]) and we add the condition (iii) above, because there seems to have been no bi-Lipschitz versions of Thom's second isotopy lemma.

It follows from Definition [\ref=def1] that for any Lipschitz trivial deformation-germ [formula] of f, there exist germs of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that the following diagram is commutative:

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula] are canonical projections. The main result of this paper is the following:

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs. Suppose that the following three conditions are satisfied.

There exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)).

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Lipschitz trivial deformation-germ of f.

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Lipschitz trivial deformation-germ of g.

Then, f and g are bi-Lipschitz A-equivalent.

The condition (i) in Theorem [\ref=thm1] is equivalent to say that f and g are K-equivalent (see [\cite=mather3]).

A C∞ map-germ [formula] is said to be Lipschitz stable if any C∞ deformation-germ of f is Lipschitz trivial.

As a corollary of Theorem 1, the following Lipschitz version of Fukuda-Fukuda theorem [\cite=fukudafukuda] is obtained.

Let [formula] be two Lipschitz stable map-germs. Suppose that there exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)). Then, f and g are bi-Lipschitz A-equivalent.

In the case that both the given two map-germs f and g are of rank zero, Theorem 1 can be strengthened as follows.

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs of rank zero. Suppose that the following two conditions are satisfied.

There exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)).

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Lipschitz trivial deformation-germ of f.

Then, f and g are bi-Lipschitz A-equivalent.

Remark 1. Let [formula] given by

[formula]

It is easily seen that f(x,y) = M(x,y)g(x,y) with [formula]. Moreover, it is well known that f is infinitesimally stable, hence any C∞ deformation germ of f is C∞ trivial (and hence Lipschitz trivial). However, f and g are not bi-Lipschitz A-equivalent. This example shows that rank zero hypothesis is essential in Theorem [\ref=thm2].

In Section 2, Cr versions of Theorem 1, Corollary 1 and Theorem 2 are reviewed where 0  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  . In Section 3, a strategy to show Theorems 1 and 2 is explained. Theorems 1 and 2 are proved in Section 4.

The Cr versions (0  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  )

In this section, for the readers' convenience, we review Cr versions of Theorem 1, Corollary 1 and Theorem 2 (0  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ) briefly. For details on Cr versions (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ), refer to [\cite=nishimuratopology]; and on C0 versions, refer to [\cite=nishimuralondon] (see also [\cite=nishimurabanach] where [\cite=nishimuralondon] [\cite=nishimuratopology] and related results are summarized).

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs.

The given f and g are said to be Cr A-equivalent (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ) if there exist germs of Cr diffeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that [formula].

The given f and g are said to be topologically A-equivalent if there exist germs of homeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that [formula].

Let [formula] be a C∞ map-germ. A C∞ deformation-germ [formula] of f is said to be Cr A-trivial (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ) if there exist germs of Cr diffeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that the diagram (1) in Section 1 is commutative.

The Cr versions (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  )

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs. Suppose that the following three conditions are satisfied.

There exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)).

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Cr A-trivial deformation-germ of f.

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Cr A-trivial deformation-germ of g.

Then, f and g are Cr A-equivalent (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ).

A C∞ map-germ [formula] is said to be Cr stable (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ) if any C∞ deformation of f is Cr A-trivial (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ). It is common in the literature to call a C∞ stable map-germ just by stable map-germ.

Let [formula] be two Cr stable map-germs (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ). Suppose that there exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)). Then, f and g are Cr A-equivalent.

Notice that for r =   ∞  , Corollary [\ref=corol1] is the classical Mather's classification theorem for stable map-germs (see [\cite=mather4]).

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs of rank zero. Suppose that the following two conditions are satisfied.

There exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)).

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Cr A-trivial deformation-germ of f.

Then, f and g are Cr A-equivalent (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  ).

The C0 version

Let [formula] be a C∞ map-germ. A C∞ deformation-germ [formula] of f is said to be Thom trivial if there exist C-regular stratifications in the sense of [\cite=bekka], S of [formula], T of [formula] and [formula] of [formula] such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

The map-germ [formula] is a Thom map-germ with respect to S and T, where [formula] is the canonical projection.

The canonical projection [formula] is a stratified map-germ with respect to T and [formula].

It is known that there exists a controlled tube system for any C-regular stratification (see [\cite=bekka]). By Thom's second isotopy lemma, it follows that for any Thom trivial deformation-germ [formula] of f, there exist germs of homeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that the diagram (1) in Section 1 is commutative.

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs. Suppose that the following three conditions are satisfied.

There exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)).

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Thom trivial deformation-germ of f.

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Thom trivial deformation-germ of g.

Then, f and g are topologically A-equivalent.

A C∞ map-germ [formula] is said to be MT-stable if the jet extension of it is multitransverse to the Thom-Mather canonical stratification of the jet space (for the Thom-Mather canonical stratification, see for instance [\cite=gibsonetall] [\cite=matherhowto] [\cite=duplessiswall]). By definition, it follows that any C∞ deformation of an MT-stable map-germ is Thom trivial. Hence, the following Fukuda-Fukuda theorem follows from Theorem [\ref=theorem_5].

Let [formula] be MT-stable map-germs. Suppose that there exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)). Then, f and g are topologically A-equivalent.

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs of rank zero. Suppose that the following two conditions are satisfied.

There exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)).

The C∞ map-germ [formula] given by

[formula]

is a Thom trivial deformation-germ of f.

Then, f and g are topologically A-equivalent.

Strategy

The strategy to prove Theorems 1 and 2 is almost the same as the strategies given in [\cite=nishimuralondon] [\cite=nishimuratopology]. In [\cite=nishimuralondon] (resp., [\cite=nishimuratopology]), the strategy is stated in terms of germs of homeomorphisms (resp., germs of Cr diffeomorphisms (1  ≤  r  ≤    ∞  )). It is possible to be stated also in terms of germs of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms as shown below.

Let [formula] be two C∞ map-germs. Suppose that there exist a germ of C∞ diffeomorphism [formula] and a C∞ map-germ [formula] such that f(x) = M(x)g(s(x)). Then, we let [formula] be the map-germ defined by

[formula]

where [formula] (resp., [formula]) is the p-dimensional Euclidean space [formula] which plays the role of the parameter space (resp., the target space ) of F. Suppose furthermore that F is Lipschitz trivial. Then, it follows from Definition [\ref=def1] that there exist L-stratifications in the sense of [\cite=mostowski] [\cite=parusinski] [\cite=parusinski2], S of [formula], T of [formula] and [formula] of [formula] such that the three conditions in Definition [\ref=def1] are satisfied. By the condition (iii) of Definition [\ref=def1], there exist germs of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms [formula] and [formula] such that the diagram (1) in Section 1 is commutative. By the commutative diagram (1) we may put

[formula]

f(h1(x,g(s(x)))) = H1(0,g(s(x))).

If the map germ from [formula] to [formula] defined by

[formula]

is a germ of homeomorphism, then the map germ defined by

[formula]

maps the germ of the set (F- 1(0),(0,0)) onto the germ of the graph of f at (0,0).

If the map germ (2) is bi-Lipschitz, then the endomorphism germ of [formula] defined by

[formula]

is also bi-Lipschitz.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.3].  The proof is almost the same as the proof of Lemma 2.3 in [\cite=nishimuralondon]. The map-germ (4) can be decomposed as follows.

[formula]

If the map-germ (2) is bi-Lipschitz, then the map-germ (3) is also bi-Lipschitz. Since the first map-germ of (5) is the germ of the graph of [formula] at (0,0), the composition of the first and the second map-germ in (5) is also a germ of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism to the germ of the set

[formula]

with respect to the induced metric from [formula]. The last map-germ in (5) is the restriction of the canonical projection [formula] to (6). By Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.2], (6) is equal to the germ of the set ((f),(0,0)). Hence, (4) is bi-Lipschitz.   [formula]

Let T0 be the stratum of T containing the origin (0,0). If T0 is transverse to the linear space [formula], then the map-germ (2) is bi-Lipschitz.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.4].  It is clearly seen that the map-germ (2) is Lipschitz even if T0 is not transverse to [formula].

We show that if T0 is transverse to [formula], then the map-germ (2) has its inverse which is also Lipschitz. It is easily seen that the map-germ (2) has its inverse if T0 is transverse to [formula]. For each i (1  ≤  i  ≤  p), let [formula] be the germ of stratified Lipschitz vector field such that the condition (iii) of Definition [\ref=def1] is satisfied. Moreover, let [formula] be the germ of local flow for ηi. Then, the following holds where [formula].

[formula]

For any sufficiently small [formula] in [formula] and [formula], set [formula]. Let [formula] be sufficiently small two points of [formula]. Then, since ηi is Lipschitz for any i (1  ≤  i  ≤  p), there exists a positive constant L such that the following holds for any j (1  ≤  j  ≤  p), where yj,λ (resp., [formula]) stands for [formula] (resp., [formula]) and yp + 1,λ (resp., [formula]) stands for H1(0,λ)) (resp., [formula]).

[formula]

Since [formula] is sufficiently small, we may assume that |λj| < 1 for any j (1  ≤  j  ≤  p). Thus, by Gronwall's inequality (for instance, see [\cite=hartman]), the following holds:

[formula]

For any j (1  ≤  j  ≤  p), set [formula], where [formula] is the trivial vector field of [formula] with respect to the i-th coordinate function yi of the standard coordinate neighborhood [formula]. Let the following p by p matrix be denoted by M(y,λ):

[formula]

Since T0 is transverse to [formula], we have that [formula] are linearly independent. This implies that [formula] is positive. By the continuity of ηi with respect to [formula], it follows that there exists a positive constant M such that

[formula]

for any sufficiently small [formula].

Let ε > 0 be a sufficiently small real number and let [formula] be a regular curve such that ψ(0)∈Δ and [formula], where Δ is the diagonal set of [formula]. Set [formula] (1  ≤  i  ≤  2,1  ≤  j  ≤  p). Then, the following equality holds:

[formula]

By differentiating both sides of the above equality with respect to t at t = 0, we have

[formula]

Combining this equality and the Maclaurin expansion of [formula], we have the following:

[formula]

Let [formula] be the function defined by

[formula]

Moreover, let [formula] be the blowup centered at Δ. The equality (8) shows that there exists the unique continuous function [formula] such that [formula] on [formula]. Thus, by the inequality (7), for any sufficiently small [formula] such that [formula], the following holds:

[formula]

Therefore, for any sufficiently small [formula], we have the following inequality which shows that the inverse map-germ of (2) is actually Lipschitz.

[formula]

[formula]

Proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2

The proof of Theorem 1 (resp., Theorem 2) is almost the same as the proof of Theorem 1.2 (resp., Theorem 1.3) in [\cite=nishimuralondon]. Theorem 1.3 in [\cite=nishimuralondon] is proved by using terms of Thom trivial deformations, C-regular stratifications, Lemma 3.1 and the following two lemmas.

If the map germ from [formula] defined by

[formula]

is a germ of homeomorphism, then the endomorphism germ of [formula] defined by

[formula]

is also a germ of homeomorphism.

Suppose that F is Thom trivial. Let S, T and [formula] be the C-regular stratifications of [formula], [formula] and [formula] respectively whose existence are guaranteed by Thom triviality of F. Let T0 be the stratum of T containing the origin (0,0). If T0 is transverse to the linear space [formula], then the map-germ λ  ↦  H1(0,λ) is a germ of homeomorphism.

For the proof of Theorem 1.2 in [\cite=nishimuralondon], since we need to consider perturbations of F(x,λ) = f(x) - M(x)λ and g(x,λ) = g(x) - M(s- 1(x))- 1λ by matrices, two modifications of Lemma [\ref=lemma_4.2] are used. By the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.4], it is not hard to prove that bi-Lipschitz version of these two modifications of Lemma [\ref=lemma_4.2] follows.

Therefore, by replacing Thom trivial, C-regular stratifications and Lemmas [\ref=lemma_4.1] and [\ref=lemma_4.2] (resp., Lemma [\ref=lemma_4.1] and two modifications of Lemma [\ref=lemma_4.2]) with Lipschitz trivial, L-regular stratifications and Lemmas [\ref=lemma_3.3] and [\ref=lemma_3.4] (resp., Lemma [\ref=lemma_3.3] and the bi-Lipschitz version of two modifications of Lemma [\ref=lemma_4.2]) respectively, the Proof of Theorem 1.3 (resp., Theorem 1.2) in [\cite=nishimuralondon] works well as the proof of Theorem 2 (resp., Theorem 1).   [formula]

Remark 2. To give sufficient conditions for bi-Lipschitz A-equivalence of Lipschitz stable map-germs is a key step in the attempt to answer the following difficult open question in the subject of density of stable mappings:

Question: Is the set of Lipschitz stable mappings dense in C∞(Mn,Np), with the Whitney C∞ topology, when (n,p) are outside the nice dimensions ?

It is well known that C0 stable maps are dense in general and that C1 stability fails to be dense in the function space exactly when C∞ stability fails to be dense, that is, outside the nice dimensions. However, few results are known about Lipschitz stable maps. Actually we know of no example of a Lipschitz stable map (or germ) which is not C∞ stable.
