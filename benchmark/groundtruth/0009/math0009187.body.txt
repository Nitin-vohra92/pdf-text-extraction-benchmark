Cubic identities for theta series in three variables

Introduction

In [\cite=BB] (see also [\cite=BBG]) Borwein and Borwein proved the identity

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

where ω  =   exp (2πi / 3). We call these functions theta series for convenience. Subsequently Hirschhorn, Garvan and J. Borwein [\cite=HGB] proved the corresponding identity for two-variable analogues of these theta series. Solé [\cite=S] (see also [\cite=SL]) gave a new proof of ([\ref=originalid]) using a lattice having the structure of a [formula]-module. Here we introduce three-variable analogues of the theta series a(q), b(q) and c(q), and adapt Solé's method to prove corresponding identities for them.

Theta series

We introduce our three-variable theta series as sums over elements of the Eisenstein field [formula].

Let [formula] and let [formula] be its ring of integers, where [formula]. Write [formula]. For α∈K define [formula], the trace of α. The element λ generates a prime ideal of O of norm 3; the inclusion [formula] induces an isomorphism [formula]. Hence we can unambiguously define, for α∈O, χ(α) = ωa where [formula] and [formula] (mod λO).

We now define our theta series. We start with

[formula]

Next for any integer k define

[formula]

It is apparent that bk(q,z,w) depends only on the congruence class of k modulo 3 and that b0(q,z,w) = a(q,z,w). We also define

[formula]

Again ck(q,z,w) depends only on the congruence class of k modulo 3 and c0(q,z,w) = a(q,z,w).

We observe some symmetry properties of these functions.

We have

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

From ([\ref=bSymm]) and ([\ref=cSymm]) we see that b1(q,1,1) = b- 1(q,1,1) and c1(q,1,1) = c- 1(q,1,1). We write

[formula]

We shall soon see that this agrees with our previous definition.

We show that these functions specialize to the two-variable functions introduced in [\cite=HGB]. First of all, each element α∈O can be uniquely written as α = nω - mω2. Then T(α) = m - n and

[formula]

and so

[formula]

which is denoted as a(q,z) in [\cite=HGB]. In particular

[formula]

in agreement with the original definition. Also | -   ωα|2 = |α|2 and T( - ωα) = T((m - nω2) / λ) = n. Hence

[formula]

which is denoted as a'(q,z) in [\cite=HGB]. Now χ( - ωα) = ωm - n and similarly

[formula]

which is denoted as b(q,z) in [\cite=HGB]. In particular

[formula]

Note that b1(q,1,z) = b- 1(q,1,z) by ([\ref=bSymm]). Finally [formula] and so

[formula]

and this is denoted by q1 / 3c(q,z) in [\cite=HGB]. Again note that c- 1(q,z,1) = c1(q,z,1) by ([\ref=bSymm]). In particular

[formula]

Identities

Our main result is a generalization of (1.25) in [\cite=HGB].

For each integer k,

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Also

[formula]

Another particular case is obtained by setting w = 1 to give

[formula]

(using ([\ref=cSymm])) which is (1.25) in [\cite=HGB].

A variant of the argument of Theorem [\ref=thm1] gives the following result.

For each k,

[formula]

In particular

[formula]

We have

[formula]

Also

[formula]

Another special case is

[formula]

which is (1.26) in [\cite=HGB].
