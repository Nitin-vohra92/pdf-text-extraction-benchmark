/ IN THE CHIRAL LIMIT USING LARGE Nc

Introduction

We present our calculation of / in the chiral limit.[\cite=BP1] Its experimental observation is the first new major CP-violation result since the original discovery.[\cite=Cenci]

This calculation uses the large Nc approach pioneered by Bardeen et al.[\cite=Bardeen]. We used this method previously to calculate BK[\cite=BP2], the ΔI = 1 / 2-rule[\cite=BP3], the muon g - 2 and electromagnetic mass differences.[\cite=BPP] Similar recent work is [\cite=Hambye] [\cite=LMD]

Short-distance and X-boson or fictitious gauge boson scheme

ΔS = 1 weak decays are produced by the exchange of W-bosons. The resulting effective action, resumming αS log (MX  /  ν) to two-loops, is now standard. An introduction and references can be found in the lectures by Buras.[\cite=Buras] The resulting effective action, [formula] with Qi(x) four-quark operators, is dependent on the various schemes chosen in its definition. This dependence should disappear in the matrix-elements of this effective action which are usually calculated in a different way.

Because currents and densities can be matched more easily across theories, we first replace the effective four-quark operator action by an equivalent one. For instance, the effective action reproducing [formula] by the exchange of the heavy fictitious X1 is Γ g(μ,) y   X { (x) + (x) }   . The constants, like [formula], are determined unambiguously from matching conditions in the perturbative regime,[\cite=BP1] [\cite=BP2] removing the scheme-dependence.

Long-distance and results

We calculate the matrix-elements of X-boson exchange by integrating over its momentum pX in the Euclidean. The short-distance contribution, p2X  >  μ2, is, to NLO in 1 / Nc, calculable using perturbative QCD and factorization. The long-distance part, small p2X, can be calculated with Chiral Perturbation Theory, also done by[\cite=Hambye]. This fails at fairly low p2X and we have chosen a reasonable hadronic model, the ENJL model, to extend the range to higher values. We find good matching for the isospin zero amplitude a0 and for all the imaginary parts. Another improvement route is the LMD method[\cite=LMD].

We obtain, to NLO in 1 / Nc and in the chiral limit,[\cite=BP1] a0 within errors and
