Achievable spectral radii of symplectic Perron-Frobenius matrices

Introduction

We recall that a self-homeomorphism φ of a surface F with [formula] is called pseudo-Anosov if it leaves invariant a pair of transverse, singular, measured foliations [formula], [formula] called the stable and unstable foliations, respectively. Associated to such a map is an algebraic unit λφ called the dilatation of φ which measures how the map stretches [formula] and shrinks [formula]. The dilatation encodes a variety of dynamical properties, for example the topological entropy of φ is log(λφ). Recently there has been a great deal of interest in the dilatations of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms, including a recent paper of Farb, Leininger, and Margalit which explores connections between low dilatation pseudo-Anosovs and 3-manifolds (see [\cite=FLM]). More generally, the question of which dilatations can be realized by some pseudo-Anosov has received attention (see for example [\cite=F] and [\cite=LT]).

There are a number of ways to find the dilatation λφ of a pseudo-Anosov φ. By taking suitable branched coverings, λφ can be made to appear as the largest root of an integral symplectic matrix. In fact, in [\cite=P] Penner describes a symplectic pairing which is preserved by the action of φ by an integral Perron-Frobenius matrix. This matrix encodes the action of φ on a train track τ which carries it, and the dilatation appears as the spectral radius of the matrix (for more on train tracks and pseudo-Anosovs, see [\cite=BH], [\cite=P], and  [\cite=FM]). Different train tracks and different pseudo-Anosovs will have different symplectic pairings associated to them. The pairing in general may have degeneracies, but in large classes of examples the pairing is non-degenerate (and in fact a symplectic form).

The motivation for this paper came from thinking about what algebraic units appear as spectral radii of integral symplectic Perron-Frobenius matrices, and hence could potentially appear as dilatations of pseudo-Anosov automorphisms. Additionally, we want to be able to construct these matrices to preserve a prescribed symplectic form.

Let [formula] be an algebraic unit, that is, λ is the root of a polynomial which is irreducible over the integers and of the form [formula]. If also |λ|  >  1, λ has algebraic multiplicity 1, and for all other roots ω of [formula] we have |λ  +  λ- 1|  >  |ω  +  ω- 1| we will say λ is a Perron unit. From [formula], we can form a self-reciprocal (or palindromic) polynomial [formula] for which λ and λ- 1 are both roots. If λ is a Perron unit, then it is the unique largest root of [formula].

We want to find Perron units which appear as the spectral radius of a symplectic Perron-Frobenius matrix. In particular, we will prove:

The proof is constructive enough that it is possible to find a matrix for λ with the assistance of a computer.

The rest of this paper is divided into three parts. In the first part, we give a canonical form for integral symplectic matrices so that it is easy to construct a matrix preserving a given symplectic form and having a given self-reciprocal polynomial as its characteristic polynomial. In the second part, we show how to conjugate a power of these matrices to be Perron-Frobenius. In particular, we prove:

Let M be an integral matrix with a unique, real eigenvalue of largest modulus greater than 1. Suppose also that this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 1, and that M preserves a symplectic form L.

Then [formula] and [formula] such that B- 1MnB is an integral, Perron-Frobenius matrix. Furthermore, B- 1MnB will also preserve L.

In the final section, we give an immediate application of some of these results to subshifts of finite type. Given an integral Perron-Frobenius matrix, it is always possible to build a larger Perron-Frobenius matrix whose entries are all either 0 or 1. This new matrix will have the same spectral radius as the original one, so the results above show that every Perron unit appears as the spectral radius of a such a matrix. In fact, up to multiplaction by tk, the characteristic polynomial of the new matrix is the same as the one it was built from. We include this discussion both as a simple application and because it may also be useful in studying pseudo-Anosovs.

Although the motivation for this paper was to study pseudo-Anosov maps, there are applications of these results outside the study of surface automorphisms. See for example [\cite=H]. To the author's knowledge these results are unknown, though some may seem like basic facts.

A Canonical Form for Self-Reciprocal Polynomials

In this section, we establish a canonical form for integral matrices with self-reciprocal characteristic polynomial. These matrices preserve a symplectic form which is standard in the sense that it arises naturally from the study of surface automorphisms.

A polynomial [formula] over the integers is self-reciprocal if its coefficients are palindromic, i.e, [formula] has the form

[formula]

Let [formula] be the symplectic group over [formula]. Up to change of basis, we may represent any non-degenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear form by either

[formula]

or

[formula]

Where I represents the g  ×  g identity matrix. We specify J because it is the symplectic form we usually think of when considering the action of a surface automorphism on the first homology group of the surface. We include K because it is easier to work with in obtaining the results of this section.

We now define two standard forms for a matrix which has the self-reciprocal polynomial [formula] as its characteristic polynomial. We will also show that each preserves one of the standard symplectic forms above. The first canonical form, denoted A below, preserves J (that is, ATJA  =  J).

[formula]

By performing the change of basis which carries J to K, we obtain a second canonical form, denoted B, which preserves K.

[formula]

The proofs of this section could be considered tedious, and the uninterested reader should have no problems skipping to section [\ref=S:ChangeBasisToPF] after first reading theorem [\ref=T:AlgUnitsAreSymplectic].

A preserves the symplectic form J and B preserves the symplectic form K.

It suffices to show that B preserves K. Let {e1,...,e2g} denote the standard basis vectors for [formula]. We note that the action of B on ei is:

[formula]

We now show that if <  ~ , ~  >  is the bilinear form coming from K, < Bei,Bek  >     =    < ei,ek  >  . Since this is all computational, we will do only a few cases here. A key observation to simplify calculations is that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  g we have <  ei,ek  >    ≠  0 if and only if k  =  g  +  i. In particular, <  ei,eg  +  1  >    ≠  0 if and only if i  =  1.

First we will let 1  ≤  i  ≤  g. Then:

[formula]

But checking our form K, we see that

[formula]

A slightly more complicated case occurs if we let g + 1  ≤  i  ≤  2g - 1 and k  =  2g. Then:

[formula]

The other cases are not more difficult than the two above.

Now we will show that A and B both have characteristic polynomials of form ([\ref=E:Palindromic]).

The characteristic polynomials of A and B are both [formula].

As with the proof of lemma [\ref=L:PreservesForm], we prove our result for B and the result immediately follows for A.

Let B0  =  B  -  tI, and let Bk + 1 be the matrix obtained from Bk by blocking off the first row and first column. Then the [formula] minor of Bk is 1 for 0  ≤  k  <  g. Thus we see that

[formula]

Where Bg has form:

[formula]

Let Dg  =  Bg and for l  ≥  g let Dl - 1 be the matrix obtained from Dl by blocking off the last row and last column. Then for g  ≥  l  >  2, the [formula] minor of Dl is 1. Thus we have:

[formula]

Notice that in the equation above that if g is even, then every coefficient is negative. If g is odd, every coefficient is positive. Now,

[formula]

Now by substituting ([\ref=E:3]) into ([\ref=E:2]) into ([\ref=E:1]), we obtain our result.

Putting lemmas [\ref=L:PreservesForm] and [\ref=L:CharPoly] together, we have the following theorem:

Every algebraic unit is an eigenvalue of some symplectic matrix.

Let λ be an algebraic unit with minimum polynomial [formula]. Then [formula] is a self-reciprocal polynomial. Applying lemmas [\ref=L:PreservesForm] and [\ref=L:CharPoly] we obtain our result.

Changing Basis to be Perron-Frobenius

We say a real matrix M is Perron-Frobenius if it has all nonnegative entries and Mk has strictly positive entries for some [formula]. Such matrices have important applications in dynamical systems, graph theory, and in studying pseudo-Anosov surface automorphisms. A key result about such matrices was proved in the early 20th century:

The eigenvalue λ is called the spectral radius or growth rate of M. The main purpose of this section is to find integral matrices which can be conjugated to be Perron-Frobenius. We'd also like to do this in a way which preserves a fixed symplectic form (for example, the symplectic form J from section [\ref=S:CanonicalSympForm]). In particular, we prove the following:

Let [formula] such that M has a unique, real eigenvalue of largest modulus greater than 1. Suppose also that this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 1.

Then [formula] and [formula] such that B- 1MnB is a Perron-Frobenius matrix in [formula].

Here we denote by [formula] the group of 2g  ×  2g integer matrices which preserve a fixed symplectic form L. When we do not care to fix a particular symplectic form, we will use the notation [formula] to mean the group of symplectic linear transformations on [formula].

We also obtain a similar result for integral, nonsingular matrices (see corollary [\ref=C:NoSymplectic]).

Given a matrix M with a unique real eigenvalue of largest modulus greater than 1, we will denote this eigenvalue λM and its associated eigenvector vM. We will refer to λM and vM as the dominating eigenvalue and dominating eigenvector, respectively.

The idea behind the proof will be to find an integral basis {b1,...,b2g} for [formula] such that vM is contained in the cone determined by b1,...,b2g. We also need that if W is the co-dimension 1 invariant subspace of M such that vM∉W, then b1,...,b2g all lie on the same side of W as vM. To make the notion of side precise, denote by W+ as the set of all vectors in [formula] that can be written as avM  +  w where [formula] and w∈W.

Let M be a matrix with a dominating real eigenvalue λM and associated real eigenvector vM. Say {b1,...,b2g} is a basis for [formula] such that b1,...,b2g∈W+ and vM is contained in the interior of the cone determined by b1,...,b2g.

Then for some [formula], Mn has all positive entries after changing to the basis above.

Since we can replace M by M2 if necessary, we may assume λM is positive. Let λ2,...,λn be the other eigenvalues of M and let vM,v2,...,v2g be a Jordan basis for M (i.e, a basis in which the linear transformation represented by M is in Jordan canonical form). Note that v2,...,v2g span W.

Consider a Jordan block associated to some eigenvalue λi of M:

[formula]

The definition of matrix multiplication guarantees that each entry of Jki will be a polynomial in λi. Each diagonal entry will equal λki and every other entry of Jki will have degree strictly less than k. Thus we see that if vj is a Jordan basis vector corresponding to the eigenvalue λi we get [formula] as [formula], which implies:

[formula]

Since vM is in the interior of the cone determined by b1,...,b2g, for positive real scalars a1,...,a2g we have vM  =  a1b1  +  ...  +  a2gb2g. Furthermore, since bi∈W+, for some positive real scalar ci and w∈W we have bi  =  civM  +  w. Since w may be expressed as a linear combination of v2,...,v2g, we see that [formula] as [formula] by ([\ref=E:JordanGrowth]). Rewriting vM and w as (real) linear combinations of b1,...,b2g, we see that for k large enough Mkbi is a positive linear combination of b1,...,b2g. Hence, Mk has all positive entries in the basis b1,...,b2g.

The last paragraph of the proof above also gives us a quick but important corollary. We will use ||  ·  || to denote the standard Euclidean norm.

Let M as in lemma [\ref=L:PFBasis] and v∈W+. Then the distance between [formula] and [formula] approaches 0 as [formula].

Our goal is now to construct a matrix [formula] such that the columns of B form a basis satisfying the hypotheses of lemma [\ref=L:PFBasis]. The idea will be to construct a set of symplectic basis vectors which define a very narrow cone, and then apply a slightly perturbed symplectic isometry of [formula] to move that cone into the correct position.

A symplectic linear transformation τ is a (symplectic) transvection if τ  ≠  1, τ is the identity map on a codimension 1 subspace U, and τv  -  v∈U for all [formula]. Geometrically, a tranvection is a shear fixing the hyperplane U. A symplectic transvection preserving the symplectic form J can be written

[formula]

for some scalar a and vector [formula]. Note that the fixed subspace is [formula] and that it contains u. [formula] is generated by transvections (see [\cite=Grove]). If we wish to preserve a symplectic form L different from J, simply replace J with L in the formula.

Let [formula] be the vector [formula] and set a  =  1. Let e1,...,e2g be the standard basis for [formula]. Notice [formula], so τu,1ei  =  ei  +  u. Thus, in matrix form:

[formula]

Composing this with transvections τek,2 with k even, we get the symplectic matrix

[formula]

This matrix preserves the symplectic form J, and is also Perron-Frobenius. In fact, we can find such a matrix for any integral symplectic form:

There is a Perron-Frobenius matrix in [formula] for any integral symplectic form L.

Non-degeneracy of L guarantees that there is [formula] such that [formula] for every basis vector ei. Let [formula], and notice that [formula]. Then τu,aei  =  ei  +  au for for a very large we have that τu,aei is close to cu for some [formula]. Now by continuity, [formula] and for [formula] we have τw, - bτu,aei  =  τu,aei  -  blw. Thus for b large enough, τw, - bτu,aei is a rational vector with positive entries for all i. This transformation has Perron-Frobenius matrix representation. If it is not integral, we can adjust the values of a and b to clear denominators.

Let [formula] denote the group of unitary linear transformations of [formula]. Equivalently, we can think of the unitary group as a group of matrices: [formula] where M* denotes the conjugate transpose of M.

We identify [formula] with a subgroup of [formula] as follows: Let [formula]. Replace every entry [formula] in M by the scaled 2  ×  2 rotation matrix [formula] We now can consider [formula] as a group of real matrices acting on [formula]. Notice that if m  ↦  R, then   ↦  RT. Thus, if [formula] is identified with [formula], we have [formula]. Hence with this identification [formula] is a subgroup of the real orthogonal group [formula] (in fact it is a subgroup of [formula]).

Notice that the symplectic form J gets identified with the complex matrix

[formula]

which is in the center of [formula]. Then if [formula] we have M*JM  =  J, and thus [formula] is a subgroup of [formula]. Below is a more powerful result which is proved in [\cite=MS] as lemma 2.17.

[formula]

We also need the following fact:

The unitary group [formula] acts transitively on [formula].

The [formula] sphere can be thought of as all vectors in [formula] having unit length. Let [formula] and {e1,...,eg} be the standard basis for [formula]. Using the Gram-Schmidt process, we can extend v to an orthonormal basis {v,v2,...,vg} for [formula]. Then the change of basis matrix is in [formula] and sends e1 to v.

At one point during the proof of our main theorem, it will become important to know that [formula] is dense in [formula]. This follows quickly from the Borel Density Theorem, but we include an elementary proof.

[formula] is dense in [formula].

Let [formula]. Perturb the entries of M' by a small amount to obtain a matrix M with rational entries. We will systematically modify the columns a1,b1,...,ag,bg of M to form a new M which preserves J and still differs from M' by a small amount. Here for convience we let <  ~ , ~  >  denote the symplectic form given by J.

We iterate the following procedure for each pair of columns ai, bi, starting with a1, b1. First, say < ai,bi  >    =  1  +  ηi where ηi is a small, rational number (its magnitude depends on the size of the perturbation of M'). Replace ai with [formula], so that now < ai,bi  >    =  1. Now we modify each pair of columns aj,bj with j  >  i. Set εi,j  =    <  ai,aj  >   and δi,j  =    <  bi,aj  >  . Replace aj with aj  -  εi,jbi  -  δi,jai, so that now <  ai,aj  >    =   < bi,aj  >    =  0. Note that εi,j and δi,j are also small rational numbers. Now modify bj by a similar procedure, so that <  ai,bj  >    =   < bi,bj  >    =  0.

Now repeat the procedure with the columns ai + 1, bi + 1. After modifying every column we obtain a new M which is in [formula]. Furthermore, since at each stage the modifications to the columns are small, M is still close to M'.

We're now ready to prove theorem [\ref=T:PFConjugation]. Throughout we will use the notation that if [formula] then [formula] denotes the normalization [formula]. If M is a matrix with no zero columns, then [formula] will denote the matrix obtained by normalizing each of the columns.

Let [formula] with dominating real eigenvalue λ and associated eigenvector vM. Let W be the co-dimension 1 invariant subspace of M with vM∉W, and W+ the component of [formula] containing vM. Set ε to be the minimal distance in [formula] from M to [formula]. Then by lemma [\ref=L:SPFExists] and corollary [\ref=C:SuckedIn], there exists [formula] and [formula] such that A is Perron-Frobenius and the convex hull H of the columns of [formula] has diameter less than ε (here we take [formula] and measure distance in [formula]).

Let ν be in the interior of H. Since [formula] acts transitively on [formula] (lemma [\ref=L:UnitaryTransitive]), there is [formula] such that Sν  =  . As a real linear transformation, S is orthogonal and hence [formula]. Thus the columns of S are contained in W+. [formula] is a subgroup of [formula] (lemma [\ref=L:UnitaryIntersection]), so [formula]. Furthermore, by lemma [\ref=L:SymplecticDense] we may perturb S slightly so that now [formula]. Set B'  =  SAn, note [formula]. Scale B' by an integer α so that B  =  αB' is a nonsingular, integral matrix.

Set d  =   det B. Then [formula], where C is the adjugate of B. In particular, C is integral.

Consider the projection map [formula]. Since [formula] is finite, for some [formula] we have Mm in the kernel of this map. Hence, we can write Mm  =  I  +  dΛ for some integral matrix Λ. Putting this together, we have:

[formula]

In particular, B- 1MmB is integral. By construction, the columns of B give a basis satisfying the conditions of lemma [\ref=L:PFBasis], so for large enough [formula] we have B- 1MmkB is Perron-Frobenius and integral. Furthermore B- 1MmkB is symplectic since B is a scaled symplectic matrix.

Using theorems [\ref=T:AlgUnitsAreSymplectic] and [\ref=T:PFConjugation], we can prove our main result, which we restate here:

Let λ be a Perron unit, and let L be any integral symplectic form.

Then for some [formula], λn is the spectral radius of an integral Perron-Frobenius matrix which preserves the symplectic form L.

Using the canonical form of section [\ref=S:CanonicalSympForm], we can build a matrix [formula] with λ its spectral radius. For some [formula] we have [formula]. Scale B' by an integer α so that B  =  αB' is integral. Now proceeding with the argument at the end of the proof for theorem [\ref=T:PFConjugation], we get that [formula]. Now we can apply theorm [\ref=T:PFConjugation] to obtain our result.

We end this section by noting that if the matrix M is not symplectic, we can modify the hypotheses slightly to achieve a result similar to theorm [\ref=T:PFConjugation]. The proof uses similar ideas, but is actually significantly easier.

Let M be an integral, nonsingular matrix with a unique, real eigenvalue of largest modulus greater than 1. Suppose also that this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 1.

Then [formula] such that Mn is conjugate to an integral Perron-Frobenius matrix.

Let δ  =   det M, and pick a [formula] such that the columns of B' satisfy the conditions of lemma [\ref=L:PFBasis]. Choose [formula] such that [formula] has integer entries and δ divides every entry of [formula]. Assuming we also chose α to be large, we may set [formula] and the columns of B will still satisfy lemma [\ref=L:PFBasis].

Consider d  =   det B. Calculating the determinant by cofactor expansion, we see that [formula]. In particular, δ is relatively prime to d, so M has a projection to [formula]. We now raise M to a power m so that Mm  =  I  +  dΛ and proceed with the argument of theorem [\ref=T:PFConjugation].

Subshifts of Finite Type

We will now apply the previous two sections to symbolic dynamics, in particular to subshifts of finite type.

Let M be an n  ×  n matrix of 0's and 1's. Let An  =  {1,2,...,n}, and form [formula]. We can think of Σn as the set of all bi-infinite sequences in symbols from An, and we endow it with the product topology. Now we form a subset ΛM  ⊆  Σn by saying [formula] if the si,si  +  1 entry of M is equal to 1 for all i. We can think of the i,j entry of M as telling us whether it is possible to transition from state i to state j. Now let σ be the automorphism of ΛM obtained by shifting every sequence one place to the left. The dynamical system [formula] is called a subshift of finite type, and can be thought of as a zero-dimensional dynamical system. These dynamical systems have relatively easy to understand dynamics and are often used to model more complicated systems (for example, pseudo-Anosov automorphisms).

Let [formula] be a square matrix with nonnegative, integer entries. We form a directed graph G from M as follows. G has one vertex for each row of M. Then connect the i-th vertex to the j-th vertex by mi,j edges, each directed from vertex i to vertex j. We call M the transition matrix for G. If M is Perron-Frobenius, then the graph G will be strongly connected and the i,j-th entry of Mk represents the number of paths of length k from vertex i to vertex j. The spectral radius λ of M can be interpreted as the growth rate of the number of paths of length k in G, i.e. [formula].

We now show how to go from an integral Perron-Frobenius matrix M to another matrix with the same spectral radius whose entries are all 0 or 1. This construction can also be found in [\cite=F]. Given a directed graph G with Perron-Frobenius transition matrix M, label the edges of G as e1,...,en and the vertices v1,...,vm. From G, we form a directed graph H as follows: the vertex set w1,...,wn of H is in 1 - 1 correspondence with the edge set of G (wi  ↔  ei). If the edge ei terminates at the vertex from which ej emanates, then we place an edge in H from wi to wj. Let N be the transition matrix of H. Note that by construction, every entry of N is either a 0 or a 1.

A subgraph of a graph G is a cycle if it is connected and every vertex has in and out valence 1. If M is a transition matrix for G, it is possible to reformulate the calculation of the characteristic polynomial [formula] in terms of cycles in G (see [\cite=BrH]):

Let G be a graph with transition matrix M. Denote by [formula] the collection of all subgraphs which have i vertices and are the disjoint union of cycles. For [formula], denote by [formula] the number of cycles in C. Then the characteristic polynomial [formula] is

[formula]

where m is the number of vertices in G and

[formula]

Using this formula, we can prove that the characteristic polynomial of N (as above) has a nice form, and in particular that the spectral radius of N is the same as the spectral radius of M.

Let M be the transition matrix for a graph with m vertices and let N be an n  ×  n matrix of 0's and 1's built from M by the construction above.

Then if [formula] is the characteristic polynomial of M, the characteristic polynomial of N is [formula]

Let G be the graph associated to M, and H the graph associated with N. Order the vertices of G, and for each vertex v fix a lexicographic order of (in-edge, out-edge) pairs of edges incident to v. Let [formula] be the collection of subgraphs of H which can be written as a union of disjoint cycles with i total vertices. For [formula], there is a canonical projection of D to a collection of paths in G (using the fact that vertices in H come from edges in G). Let [formula] be the subset of [formula] containing those disjoint unions of cycles in H which do not project to a disjoint union of cycles in G. We will show that there is a bijection between elements of [formula] having an odd number of components and elements of [formula] having an even number of components.

Let [formula] and say D has an odd number of components. Call C its projection to a collection of paths in G. Since C is not a disjoint union of cycles, there must be vertices of G that are either visited by two different paths in C and/or are visited twice by the same path. Choose v to be the minimal such vertex in the ordering of vertices of G, and note that v must have in-valence and out-valence both of at least 2. Choose two in/out-edge pairs, [formula] and [formula], such that each pair occurs in some path in C and so that they are minimal among such pairs in the ordering of edges incident to v. Note that D contains vertices in H corresponding to e,e',f,f' and must contain edges from e to f and from e' to f'. Build [formula] by letting D' have the same vertex collection as D, but instead of containing edges from e to f and from e' to f' it contains edges from e to f' and e' to f (call this operation an edge swap).

If the pairs [formula] and [formula] are both part of the same cycle in D, then D' will have one more component than D. If they are part of two different cycles, then D' will have one less component. In either case, D' has an even number of components and we have constructed a well-defined map from elements of [formula] having odd components to elements having even components. Note also that the projection C' of D' still visits v twice, and contains in/out-edge pairs [formula] and [formula]. Thus we can define the inverse of this map in exactly the same way, and hence we have a bijection.

Because of the bijection we built above, we see that disjoint unions of cycles in [formula] cancel out when [formula] when it is computed using lemma [\ref=L:CharPolyOfGraph]. Elements of [formula] are in bijective correspondence with cycles in [formula], so we get our conclusion.

Finally, we have:

Let λ be a Perron unit. Then there is [formula] such that [formula] is the topological entropy of some subshift of finite type.

This follows directly from theorems [\ref=T:PFConjugation], [\ref=T:AlgUnitsAreSymplectic], and comments of Fathi, Laudenbach, and Poéaru on subshifts of finite type (see [\cite=FS]).
