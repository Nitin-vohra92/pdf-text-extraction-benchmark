A non-existence theorem for almost split sequences

Introduction

The theory of almost split sequences has been introduced in the seventies (see [\cite=AR2] [\cite=AR3]) and is essential in the study of the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The framework of this theory is general and the almost split sequences can be studied in other contexts. Indeed, many results concerning the existence of almost split sequences exist; see for example [\cite=A1] [\cite=A2] [\cite=AR2] [\cite=HuPena] [\cite=But] [\cite=Zimm]. However, few is known about the non-existence of such sequences, at least in categories which are not Hom-finite. Some criteria following from the definition of left or right almost split morphisms are discussed in [\cite=Hu]. However, these conditions do not give the description of the objects C for which there is a right almost split morphism ending in C. The motivation of this note comes from a work of the author with R. Bautista and S. Liu in which the Auslander-Reiten theory of the finitely presented representations over an infinite quiver is discussed; see [\cite=BLP].

The main categories considered in this note are the categories of locally finite dimensional representations of infinite bound quivers. However, some results are stated in more general categories, so that it could be useful in an other context. Section 1 is devoted to the main definitions concerning the representations of quivers. In Section 2, we develop our main tool for non-existence of almost split sequences. Section 3 contains the main theorem, giving necessary and sufficient conditions on an indecomposable representation C to be the end-term of an almost split sequence.

Background on representations of quivers

Let Q = (Q0,Q1) be a quiver with countably many vertices and k be any field. A typical example of such a quiver is a locally finite quiver. Let I be an ideal of the path category kQ such that I  ⊆  Q2, where Q2 denotes the ideal of kQ generated by all paths of length two. We set AQ,I = kQ / I for the quotient category of kQ by the ideal I. We call I admissible if for x,y∈Q0, kQ(x,y) / I(x,y) is finite dimensional. In this case, the pair (Q,I) is called a bound quiver. Observe that in such a case, the number of arrows between two given vertices must be finite. If Q is a locally finite quiver such that for any pair x,y∈Q0, there is a finite number of paths from x to y, then (Q,I = 0) is a bound quiver. Also, if Q is finite and I is admissible in the sense of [\cite=ASS], then (Q,I) is a bound quiver.

Let Rep(Q,I) denote the category of all right-modules over AQ,I. Such a module is a covariant functor from AQ,I to the category Mod(k) of all k-vector spaces. Hence, M∈Rep(Q,I) is given by two families (M(x))x∈Q0 and (M(α))α∈Q1 where, for x∈Q0, M(x) is a k-vector space and for an arrow α:x  →  y, M(α):M(x)  →  M(y) is a k-linear map. Moreover, the maps (M(α))α∈Q1 must satisfy the relations of the ideal I. If M(x) is finite dimensional for every x∈Q0, then M is said to be locally finite dimensional. The full subcategory of Rep(Q,I) of all such representations is denoted by rep(Q,I). Observe that rep(Q,I) and Rep(Q,I) are not Hom-finite in general. However, from [\cite=GR], every indecomposable object in rep(Q,I) has a local endomorphism algebra.

Let [formula] denote the algebra associated to AQ,I (with no identity if Q is infinite), that is,

[formula]

as k-vector spaces and the multiplication is induced by the composition of morphisms in AQ,I. For x∈A0, let ex:x  →  x denote the identity morphism. Then ex is a primitive idempotent in [formula]. It is easy to see that there exists an equivalence between rep(Q,I) and the category [formula] of all right [formula]-modules M such that

[formula]

and Mex is finite dimensional for any vertex x in AQ,I. We will make these identifications in the sequel. Observe that for each x∈Q0, one has an [formula]-module [formula] which corresponds to a locally finite dimensional representation Px of (Q,I). Note that Px is projective indecomposable and has a one dimensional top. A representation M in rep(Q,I) is said to be finitely generated if one has an epimorphism

[formula]

with P isomorphic to a finite direct sum of representations of the form Px, x∈Q0. Observe that if f':P'  →  M is any other such morphism, then Ker  f' is finitely generated if and only if Ker  f is. In this case, M is said to be finitely presented.

Now, let (Q  op,I  op) be the opposite bound quiver of (Q,I), that is, Qop is the opposite quiver of Q and I  op is the ideal of kQ  op such that kQ  op / I  op is the opposite category of AQ,I. Let D  =  Hom( - ,k) be the duality between finite dimensional k-vector spaces and let DQ:rep(Q,I)  →  rep(Q  op,I  op) denote the pointwise duality defined as follows. If M∈rep(Q,I), then one sets DQM(x)  =  DM(x) and for α:x  →  y, DQM(α):DM(y)  →  DM(x) is the transpose of the map M(α). Now let f:M  →  N be a morphism in rep(Q,I), that is, a family {fx:M(x)  →  N(x)}x∈Q0 of k-linear maps such that for each arrow α:x  →  y, N(α)fx  =  fyM(α). We set DQ(f) to be the morphism DQN  →  DQM such that DQ(f)x:DN(x)  →  DM(x) is the transpose of the map fx. It is easily verified that DQ defines a functor and is a duality. If P'x is the projective indecomposable representation in rep(Q  op,I  op) associated to the vertex x∈Q  op0, then Ix: = DQ  op(P'x) is an indecomposable injective representation in rep(Q,I) with a one dimensional socle. A representation M in rep(Q,I) is said to be finitely co-generated if one has a monomorphism

[formula]

with I isomorphic to a finite direct sum of representations of the form Ix, x∈Q0. If, moreover, the cokernel of f if finitely co-generated, then M is said to be finitely co-presented. As for finitely presented representations, the notion of finitely co-presented representation does not depend on the chosen morphism f.

Let rep+(Q,I) be the full subcategory of rep(Q,I) of the finitely presented representations. If I = 0, then rep+(Q,I) is abelian by [\cite=BLP]. However, when I is non-zero, rep+(Q,I) need not be abelian. If M∈rep+(Q,I) is indecomposable and not projective, then one has an almost split sequence

[formula]

in rep(Q,I) with τM finitely co-presented; see [\cite=A2]. The dual results also hold. When I = 0 and Q is locally finite, the precise description of the quivers Q for which all such sequences lie in rep+(Q,I) is given in [\cite=BLP]. There is a similar characterization given in [\cite=CS] when (Q,I) is such that Q is locally finite and I is locally finitely generated. They find the bound quivers (Q,I) such that the category of finite dimensional representations has almost split sequences.

In this paper, however, we will not restrict to the category rep+(Q,I). We shall work in the whole category rep(Q,I). We know that every indecomposable non-projective representation in rep+(Q,I) is the end-term of an almost split sequence in rep(Q,I). We shall show that all other indecomposable representations in rep(Q,I) are not end-terms of almost split sequences.

Left and right almost split morphisms

Let C be an abelian k-category and let M∈C be indecomposable. A morphism f:E  →  M in C is said to be a right almost split if it is not a retraction and any morphism L  →  M in C which is not a retraction factors through f. Dually, f:M  →  E' in C is said to be a left almost split morphism if it is not a section and any morphism M  →  L in C which is not a section factors through f. A non-split short exact sequence

[formula]

in C with L,N indecomposable, f left almost split and g right almost split is called an almost split sequence. Such sequences play a crucial role, for instance, in the study of the module category of an Artin algebra, see [\cite=AR2], or in a Hom-finite Krull-Schmidt category (the definition of almost split sequences there is slightly different since a Krull-Schmidt category is not necessarily abelian), see [\cite=L3]. For more general facts concerning almost split sequences, the reader is referred to [\cite=AR3].

Suppose the contrary. Let h:E  →  N be a right almost split morphism in C. Since [formula] is the direct limit of {Ni,fi}i  ≥  0, we have φi + 1fi  =  φi for i  ≥  0. Let Li denote the subspace of Hom(Ni,E) of the morphisms g for which hg is a multiple of φi. Observe that Li is finite dimensional. A morphism g∈Li for which hg = φi is called normalized. Since h is right almost split and the φi are proper monomorphisms, each Li contains a normalized morphism and hence is non-zero. Then one has a non-zero map

[formula]

which is induced by fi and sends a normalized map to a normalized one.

Since ( * ) is almost split, φi yields a normalized map vi:Ni  →  E∈Li such that

[formula]

is normalized in Lj for 0  ≤  j  <  i. Let [formula] for 0  ≤  j  <  i with Mii  =  Li. The chain

[formula]

of finite dimensional k-vector spaces yields an integer rj  ≥  j for which 0  ≠  Mrj,j  =  Mk,j whenever k  ≥  rj. Moreover, each such Mrj,j contains a normalized map. Then the maps gi clearly induce non-zero maps

[formula]

We claim that these maps are surjective. Let u∈Mri,i. For every positive integer r > i + 1, [formula] and hence, there exists an element [formula] such that gi(ur) = u. But then uri + 1∈Mri + 1,i + 1 is such that [formula], showing the claim. Now, set u0∈Mr0,0 be a normalized map. Then there exists u1∈Mr1,1 such that [formula]. Observe that if u1 is not normalized, then there exists [formula] such that αu1 is normalized and hence that [formula] is normalized, showing that α  =  1. Hence, u1 is normalized. Choose such ui∈Mri,i for all positive integers i. Hence, for i  ≥  0, we have that hui  =  φi and ui + 1fi = ui. Since N is the direct limit of the Ni, the family of morphisms ui:Ni  →  E yields a unique morphism h':N  →  E such that h'φi  =  ui for i  ≥  0. Now, hh'φi  =  hui  =  φi for all i, showing, by uniqueness, that hh' = 1N, contradicting the fact that h is right almost split.

We state the dual result. The proof is dual.

The left and right almost split morphisms in rep(Q,I)

We start with this lemma.

Let M∈rep(Q,I). Then

The representation M is non-finitely generated if and only if there exists a chain

[formula]

of finitely generated proper subrepresentations of M such that

[formula]

The representation M is non-finitely co-generated if and only if DQ(M) is non-finitely generated.

Since Q has a countable number of vertices, there exists a chain

[formula]

of finite subsets of Q0 such that [formula]. For i  ≥  0, let Mi be the subrepresentation of M generated by the elements in [formula]. Then Mi is finitely generated such that [formula]. If M is non-finitely generated, then it is clear that the Mi are proper subrepresentations. Now, let M be finitely generated and let

[formula]

be a chain as in the statement. Since the top of M is finite dimensional and the union of the Mi is M, there exists an integer j such that Mj(x) = M(x) for any vertex x∈Q0 which supports the top of M. This yields M = Mj, contradicting the fact that the Mi are proper subrepresentations. The second statement trivially follows from the fact that DQ is a duality.

Let M,N∈rep(Q,I). Then

If M is finitely generated, then Hom(M,N) is finite dimensional.

If N is finitely co-generated, then Hom(M,N) is finite dimensional.

Suppose that M is finitely generated. Then there exists an epimorphism

[formula]

in rep(Q,I) with P a projective representation which is a finite direct sum of representations of the form Px, x∈Q0. Since we have an inclusion Hom(M,N)  →  Hom(P,N), we only need to show that Hom(P,N) is finite dimensional, which amount to the same as showing that Hom(Px,N) is finite dimensional for x∈Q0. However, this is easy to show that [formula] as k-vector spaces, which shows the claim. Now, if N is finitely co-generated, then DQ(N) is finitely generated in rep(Q  op,I  op) and [formula] as k-vector spaces. But by (1), the last Hom-space is finite dimensional.

Observe that the category Rep(Q,I) of all representations of the bound quiver (Q,I) is abelian, has co-products and satisfies

[formula]

for A,B∈Rep(Q,I) and a directed family {Ai}i∈I of subrepresentations of A. This is called a C3-category, see [\cite=Mi]. Using Lemma [\ref=firstlemma], we get the following.

We need only to prove the first statement since the second is dual. Let M∈rep(Q,I) be non-finitely generated. From Lemma [\ref=firstlemma], there exists a chain

[formula]

of finitely generated proper subrepresentations of M such that

[formula]

From [\cite=Mi], {M,φi}i  ≥  0 is the direct limit of the Mi with φi:Mi  →  M being the inclusion morphism. But then {M,φi}i  ≥  0 is also the direct limit of the Mi in rep(Q,I) since M∈rep(Q,I) and rep(Q,I) is a full subcategory of Rep(Q,I). Then we can apply Proposition [\ref=mainprop].

Now, we need to look at representations which are finitely generated but not finitely presented. Before stating the next proposition, we need to introduce some definitions. The following could be found in [\cite=War] in the context of a C3-category. However, we apply them for the category Rep(Q,I). A representation A∈Rep(Q,I) is said to be small if whenever [formula] is a morphism with [formula] the canonical projections, then pif = 0 for all but a finite number of i∈I. It is easy to see that for x∈Q0, Px is small in Rep(Q,I) and consequently, every finitely generated representation of rep(Q,I) is small in Rep(Q,I). A representation A∈Rep(Q,I) is said to be σ-small is it is the union of a chain

[formula]

of small objects of Rep(Q,I). By Lemma [\ref=firstlemma], every object in rep(Q,I) is σ-small. Suppose that E∈rep(Q,I) decomposes as a finite direct sum of indecomposable representations. In particular, by [\cite=GR], it decomposes as a finite direct sum of σ-small representations with local endomorphism algebras. By [\cite=War], every other decomposition of E refines to this given decomposition. This fact will be useful in the proof of the following.

Again, we only prove the first assertion. Suppose the contrary. Let

[formula]

be an almost split sequence in rep(Q,I) with M finitely generated but not finitely presented. Let

[formula]

be a short exact sequence with P a finite direct sum of representations of the form Px, x∈Q0. Then, by the hypothesis, Ω is not finitely generated. In particular, being a subrepresentation of a finitely generated representation, it has an infinite dimensional top. Let {ui}i  ≥  1 be an infinite family in Q0 such that the top of Ω has support {ui}i  ≥  1. For each i, let Si be a simple quotient of Ω with the support of Si being {ui}. Consider the pushout diagram

[formula]

The last row is not split since Ω  →  P is a radical morphism. Hence, one has the following pushout diagram by using the fact that ( * ) is almost split.

[formula]

Observe that ug  ≠  0 since otherwise, u induces a map u':M  →  E such that u = u'f. But then, hu'f  =  f yielding hu'  =  1M since f is an epimorphism. This is a contradiction. Therefore, v is non-zero and hence is a monomorphism. This shows that L is not finitely co-generated, since it has an infinite dimensional socle. Hence, there is no left almost split morphism starting in L using part (2) of Corollary [\ref=cor1]. But this contradicts the fact that ( * ) is almost split.

Now, suppose that f:E  →  M is right almost split with E a finite direct sum of indecomposable representations. Since, M is not finitely presented, M is not projective and hence, f is an epimorphism. Let h be an endomorphism of E such that fh = f. By [\cite=GR], h induces a decomposition [formula] of E such that f is stable on E1 and E2 and h is pointwise nilpotent on E1, meaning that for each x∈Q0, there exists a positive integer n such that (hx)n(E1) = 0. Moreover, h is an isomorphism on E2. Let h1:E1  →  E1 and h2:E2  →  E2 be the restriction of h to E1 and E2, respectively. We have [formula]. Let f = (f1  f2) be the corresponding decomposition of f. Since h1 is locally nilpotent, we have that, for x∈Q0, there exists a positive integer r such that (f1)x  =  (f1)x(h1)rx = 0. Hence, f1 = 0, meaning that f2 is a right almost split epimorphism. Now, if every endomorphism h:E  →  E with fh = f is an automorphism, then f is a right minimal almost split epimorphism (see [\cite=AR3]) and

[formula]

is then an almost split sequence by using classical arguments on almost split sequences. This is a contradiction. Hence, there exists a non-automorphism h:E  →  E providing a non-trivial decomposition [formula] as above with f2:E2  →  M being a right almost split epimorphism. Now, f2 is not minimal since this would yield an almost split sequence ending in M. Hence, as argued above, we can decompose E2 non-trivially as [formula] with the restriction E4  →  M of f2 being a right almost split epimorphism. We can continue this process infinitely many times, decomposing E as an infinite direct sum of subrepresentations of E. However, this is a contradiction by the remark preceding the lemma. Hence, there is no right almost split morphism E  →  M with E being a finite direct sum of indecomposable representations.

As mentioned in Section 1, it is proved in [\cite=A2] that there exists an almost split sequence in rep(Q,I) ending at each indecomposable finitely presented and non-projective representation M. One also has the dual result. Therefore, we get the following main theorem by combining the results obtained so far.
