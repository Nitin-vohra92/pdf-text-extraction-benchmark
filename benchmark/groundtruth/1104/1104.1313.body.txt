Deriving a basis for a set of bounded operators on the Hilbert space [formula]

Introduction

The desire to comprehend philosophies at the edge of possibility continues to be a source of intellectual advancement today as it has been at any other time in history. If such a premise is taken to be a departure point in the challenge to extend the boundaries of knowledge then theoretical and technical innovation will abide. Indeed, the theory of quantum information has advanced the concept of information established in the seminal work of Claude Shannon [\cite=shannon] and has inspired discoveries whose very nature lie at the frontier of reality.

Modern computing rests with the pioneering work of Charles Babbage [\cite=babbage] and Alan Turing [\cite=turing]. An analytical machine put forward by Babbage conceived the principle on which modern computing rests. Over a century later, Turing improved the ideas of Babbage by devising a programmable means that would become the basis for computing logic. However, challenges from a new information paradigm emerged with Richard Feynman's promise of quantum computing [\cite=feynman]. In 1985 David Deutsch [\cite=deutsch] gave credence to Feynman�s proposition by demonstrating the principle on which a quantum computer may be constructed. Quantum mechanics now offered the theory of computation a new direction with profound consequences.

The construction of a quantum computer is predicated on realizing the inherent computational processing advantage of quantum computation over its classical analogue. Fundamentally, the real power of a quantum computer rests with an ability to control quantum interference effects while utilizing the inherent principle of parallelism [\cite=deutsch]. Nevertheless, quantum computing comes with a cost and this is best explained by a set of interactions with an open quantum system called the environment. It is through these interactions that quantum noise is introduced into the quantum system leading to the process of decoherence and the complete corruption of quantum information. While explaining an exact model of quantum system-environment interaction is difficult, considerable theoretic insights into quantum noise and its effects on quantum systems have been made by studying properties of this interaction [\cite=kraus]. In particular, the operator-sum representation [\cite=kraus] [\cite=nielsenchuang00] has provided a descriptive process of quantum system-environment interactions while capturing the dynamic change to a quantum state as a result of a quantum process [\cite=nielsenchuang00].

In this paper we propose to better understand the fundamentals of noise in a quantum system. We will derive a basis for the set of bounded operators that act on a d-dimensional Hilbert space, and given basic initial assumptions, we will illustrate how this basis set may be extended to identify a set of operational elements that coincide with the operator-sum representation for a quantum operation.

Deriving a basis for a set of bounded operator on [formula]

The challenge of quantum computing and information is to elicit a reliable form of communication and to maintain such a form in the presence of quantum noise. Noise is an inevitable characteristic that subjects a quantum state to unwanted interactions with the environment. Any strategy to mitigate against quantum noise ultimately requires an understanding of the quantum operation process. To this end, the operator-sum representation [\cite=kraus] [\cite=nielsenchuang00] has provided a succinct description for the set of quantum operations that act on a quantum state thereby allowing us to understand quantum noise and its effects. We shall now characterize the dynamics of a quantum operation before deriving a set of elements that constitute a basis set for an operator-sum representation of a quantum operation.

Preliminaries

Consider a d-dimensional Hilbert space [formula] and fix each basis state to correspond to an element of ring [formula] of integers modulo d. We shall regard the Hilbert space [formula] as the principal quantum system. The basis [formula] whose elements correspond to the column vectors of the identity matrix [formula] is called the computational basis. A qudit is then a d-dimensional quantum state [formula] written as [formula] where [formula] and [formula].

To every Hilbert space [formula] there corresponds a dual space [formula] consisting of the set of all linear functionals from [formula] to the complex numbers. In particular, if [formula] is a basis for [formula], then there is a uniquely determined basis [formula] in [formula] such that the linear functional [formula] is identically [formula]. In the language of Dirac, the action of the conjugate linear map [formula] on [formula] is written and defined as 〈j|i〉  =  δi,j with δi,j denoting the Kronecker delta.

Finally, given [formula] we have with us the space of linear bounded operators on [formula]. The study of such operators is known to elicit a matrix representation. Therefore, supposing that [formula] and [formula] are states in the Hilbert space [formula], we define [formula] to be the linear operator on [formula] that maps [formula] to [formula].

Deriving a space of bounded operators on [formula]

Consider the quantum state in a principal system [formula], and further consider an adjoined environment state [formula] endowed with an orthonormal basis of dimension d2. Since [formula] is a d-dimensional Hilbert space, it suffices that the environment be a d2-dimensional Hilbert space [\cite=nielsenchuang00]. Without loss of generality, we suppose the environment state to be initially a pure state. We assume that the principal system and the environment are initially uncorrelated with the joint state of the system-environment then given as the product state [formula].

Our goal will be to chart the dynamics of the principal system and environment by allowing the joint state [formula] to evolve according to some unitary operation. As a consequence, we will explicitly derive a basis for the set of operators that act on a single qudit state.

Let U be a unitary operation acting on the product state [formula], and let us write the interaction of each basis qudit with the environment under U as

[formula]

for [formula]. By linearity of quantum mechanics, we have it that the action of the unitary operation U on the product state [formula] may then be written as

[formula]

Let ω be a primitive [formula] root of unity such that ωd = 1 and ωd  ≠  1 for all 0  <  t  <  d. Using the fact that [formula] if k = 0 and vanishes otherwise, we have it that Eq. ([\ref=env]) may be written as

The linear product representation now describes the set of operators that act on the product state [formula] with respect to the unitary operation U. In particular, the operator [formula] maps [formula] to [formula] for [formula], and thus maps [formula] to [formula]. Similarly, the operator [formula] maps [formula] to [formula]. When taken together both X1 and Z1 are called the Weyl Pair [\cite=Weyl31]. In rewriting Eq. ([\ref=three]), we have, up to a scalar,

[formula]

Thus, the action of the unitary operation U on the joint state [formula] yields the set of operators [formula] that act on the principal system.

We now show that the derived set [formula] indeed forms a basis for a space of bounded operators on [formula].

Let ω be the primitive [formula] root of unity and let [formula] and [formula]. Then, the set [formula] forms a basis for the d-dimensional Hilbert space [formula].

To show that the set [formula] is linearly independent and spans [formula], it suffices to show that the basis [formula] for [formula] may be written as a linear combination of elements from [formula]. This follows since both of these sets have cardinality d2. Let us consider the set [formula] in the [formula] basis as

[formula]

for [formula]. Then [formula]. Now, let us suppose that [formula] is expressed as the linear combination [formula]. The coefficients ξl,k are given by

[formula]

[formula]

where δl,k is the Kronecker delta;

[formula]

We show that with ξlk defined as these values then [formula] is in the span of [formula]. Now,

[formula]

with [formula] possessing a vanishing trace. Since

[formula]

as [formula], we then have it that [formula]   =  δa,b. Finally, [formula], and the result follows.

The set [formula] forms a d2-dimensional Lie algebra with a d  ×  d matrix representation defined by the matrices with entries Xm,n  =  δm,n - l, Zm,n  =  ωmkδm,n.

We have derived a set of linear operators that describe the action of a quantum operator on a principal qudit system and we have also shown that this derived set forms a basis for the space of operators on [formula]. Finally, we note that Eq. [\ref=XZ] provides a conceptual foundation for many aspects of quantum information.

On the operator-sum representation

The quantum operations formalism is a general description for the evolution of a quantum system. A more succinct description for this formalism is given by the operator-sum representation, see [\cite=nielsenchuang00] and references therein. The operator-sum representation is a significant quantum theoretical model in that it concisely characterizes the set of changes that arise when a quantum system evolves in time. We shall now outline the operator-sum representation for a quantum operation E.

We begin with a principal system to which we adjoin an environment system which we assume is spanned by an orthonormal set of basis states [formula], 1  ≤  m  ≤  d2. We suppose that environment is prepared in the pure state [formula] and that the principal system and environment are initially uncorrelated. We further suppose the state of the joint system may be written as the product state [formula]. Next, we apply a unitary operation U to the joint state before implementing a partial trace over the environment. We summarize the operator-sum representation of a quantum operation E on a state ρ as

[formula]

The set {Em, 1  ≤  m  ≤  d2} represents the set of operation elements for the quantum operation E and satisfies the completeness relation [formula].

Now, let us recall Sec. [\ref=pre] wherein we considered a pure state of a principal system adjoined an environment system spanned by an orthonormal basis set of dimension d2. We defined a unitary operator U to act on the state [formula] of the joint system. The result of the unitary operator U on [formula] yielded a set of operators acting on the principal system;

[formula]

Motivated by a question raised by Nielsen and Chuang [\cite=nielsenchuang00] and by the material of Sec. [\ref=pre], we now consider the question of how an operator-sum representation can be determined for an open quantum system. To this end, we will extend the unitary operator U defined in Sec. [\ref=pre] to act on the entire state space of the joint system. The representative input state is [formula] and is written

[formula]

with [formula] and [formula] Next, we allow the unitary operator U to act on the initial state [formula] according to [formula]. By linearity, we have it that We shall now make repeated use of an earlier stated fact. Let ω be a primitive [formula] root of unity. It then follows that [formula] when k = 0 while [formula] vanishes in all other instances. In rewriting Eq. [\ref=operator], we have Finally, on performing a partial trace over the environment system on Eq. [\ref=nearlydone], we obtain, up to a scaling factor,

[formula]

Equation [\ref=last] represents a model for the operator-sum representation of a quantum operation explicitly in terms of operators on the principal system. We identify the set [formula] as being a possible set of operation elements for such a representation.

We note that after performing a partial trace over environment, the state of the system is always expressible in terms of an operator-sum representation. As such, the elements 1 / dXlZk for [formula] do not provided a unique representation for the operation elements for a quantum operation.

Conclusion

We explicitly derived a set of elements that act on a d-dimensional Hilbert space. We demonstrated that the derived set forms a basis for the set of bounded operators acting on the Hilbert space [formula]. As an application, we considered the operator-sum representation of a quantum operation, and illustrated how the derived set may be identified with a set of operational elements for such an operation.
