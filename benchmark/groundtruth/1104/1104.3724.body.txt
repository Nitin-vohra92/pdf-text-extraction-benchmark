A sequence A of positive integers is called primitive if no term of the sequence divides any other. Erds proved that for any primitive sequence [formula], the series [formula] converges and its sum is bounded by 1.84 (see [\cite=ez]). This bound is later improved by Clark [\cite=c] to eδ ( < 1.7811), where δ is the Euler constant. In [\cite=ez], Erds conjectured that for any primitive sequence [formula], we have:

[formula]

This means that the quantity [formula] ([formula] is a primitive sequence) reaches its maximum value at the primitive sequence [formula] of primes numbers. Although several results support the conjecture (see for example [\cite=z]), we prove in this paper that it is false. Actually we give a primitive sequence [formula] for which [\eqref=eq1] doesn't hold.

Let [formula] denote the sequence of prime numbers. Set

[formula]

It is clear that [formula] is a primitive sequence. The computer calculations give:

[formula]

So, we have:

[formula]

By adding [formula] to the two hand-sides of this inequality, we get:

[formula]

as required. The conjecture of Erds is disapproved.[formula]
