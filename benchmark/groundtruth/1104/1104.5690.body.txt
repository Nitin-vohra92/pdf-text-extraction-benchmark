Twisted conjugacy in braid groups

Key words: Braid group, twisted conjugacy. MSC: 20F36, 20F10.

Introduction

Let G be a group, and φ∈Aut(G) an automorphism (which we shall write on the left of the argument, g  ↦  φ(g)). We say that two elements u,v∈G are φ-twisted conjugated, denoted u  ~  φv, if there exists x∈G such that v = (φ(x))- 1ux. It is straightforward to see that ~  φ is an equivalence relation on G, which coincides with standard conjugation in the case φ = Id (we shall use the symbol ~   instead of ~  Id). Reidemeister was the first author considering this concept (see [\cite=Reid]), which has an important role in modern Nielsen fixed point theory.

As one might expect, in general, twisted conjugacy classes are much more complicated to understand than standard conjugacy classes in a group G. For instance, algorithmic recognition of them already presents big differences. The twisted conjugacy problem for a group G consists on finding an algorithm which, given an automorphism φ∈Aut(G) and two elements u,v∈G, decides whether u  ~  φv or not. While the conjugacy problem (i.e. the Id-twisted conjugacy problem) is very easy for free groups, both conceptually and computationally, the twisted conjugacy problem is solvable but much harder in both senses, see Theorem 1.5 in [\cite=BMMV].

Of course, a positive solution to the twisted conjugacy problem automatically gives a solution to the (standard) conjugacy problem, which in turn provides a solution to the word problem. The existence of a finitely presented group G with solvable word problem but unsolvable conjugacy problem is well known (see [\cite=M1]). In the same direction, there exists a finitely presented group with solvable conjugacy problem, but unsolvable twisted conjugacy problem (see Corollary 4.9 in [\cite=BMV]).

A subgroup [formula] is said to be orbit decidable if there is an algorithm which, given two elements u,v∈G as input, decides whether one can be mapped to the other up to conjugacy, by some automorphism in A, i.e. whether v  ~  α(u) for some α∈A (see [\cite=BMV] for more details). For example, the conjugacy problem in G coincides precisely with the orbit decidability of the trivial subgroup [formula].

Let

[formula]

be a short exact sequence of groups. Since α(F) is normal in G, for every g∈G, the right conjugation γg of G induces an automorphism of F, x  ↦  g- 1xg, which will be denoted φg∈Aut(F) (note that, in general, φg does not belong to Inn(F)). It is clear that the set of all such automorphisms,

[formula]

forms a subgroup of Aut(F) containing Inn(F). We shall refer to it as the action subgroup of the given short exact sequence.

Such a sequence is said to be algorithmic provided it is given along with algorithms: (i) to compute in the groups F, G and H (i.e. multiply and invert elements), and compute images under α and β; (ii) to compute one pre-image in G of any given element in H; and (iii) to compute pre-images in F of elements in G mapping to the trivial element in H. The typical example (though not the unique one) of an algorithmic short exact sequence occurs when groups are given by finite presentations and maps are given by images of generators. In fact, (i) is immediate, we can use the positive part of the membership problem for β(G) in H to compute pre-images in G of elements in H, and use the positive part of the membership problem for α(F) in G to compute pre-images in F of elements in G mapping to 1H (see Section 2 in [\cite=BMV]).

Assuming certain conditions on the groups F and H, the main result in [\cite=BMV] establishes the following characterization of the solvability of the conjugacy problem for G, in terms of the orbit decidability for the corresponding action subgroup.

Let

[formula]

be an algorithmic short exact sequence of groups such that

F has solvable twisted conjugacy problem,

H has solvable conjugacy problem, and

for every 1  ≠  h∈H, the subgroup 〈h〉 has finite index in its centralizer CH(h), and there is an algorithm which computes a finite set of coset representatives, [formula],

[formula]

Then, the conjugacy problem for G is solvable if and only if the action subgroup [formula] is orbit decidable.

Many groups satisfy conditions (ii) and (iii); for example, they are easily verified for a finitely generated free group, and with a bit more work, they can also be proven for torsion-free hyperbolic groups, see Proposition 4.11 in [\cite=BMV].

On the other hand, solvability of the twisted conjugacy problem is a stronger condition on F. In this sense, the introduction of [\cite=BMV] contains the following comment: "In light of Theorem [\ref=ses], it becomes interesting, first, to collect groups F where the twisted conjugacy problem can be solved. And then, for every such group F, to study the property of orbit decidability for subgroups of Aut(F): every orbit decidable (undecidable) subgroup of Aut(F) will correspond to extensions of F having solvable (unsolvable) conjugacy problem".

The goal of the present paper is to contribute a new result into this direction, taking as a base group the braid group, F = Bn.

Consider the braid group on n strands, given by the classical presentation

[formula]

It is well known that the conjugacy problem is solvable in Bn. The first, non-efficient solution was given by Garside [\cite=Garside]. It was subsequently improved in [\cite=EM] [\cite=Franco_GM] [\cite=Birman_Ko_Lee] [\cite=Gebhardt] [\cite=Gebhardt_GM], in such a way that the current solution is very efficient in most cases.

The conjugacy problem is solvable in Bn.

Also, the automorphism group of Bn is quite well understood. Among other results, the following one will be crucial for our argumentation.

Let Bn be the braid group on n strands. Then |Out(Bn)| = 2. More precisely, [formula], where ε:Bn  →  Bn is the automorphism which inverts each generator, σi  ↦  σ- 1i.

Using the above two results, we will solve the twisted conjugacy problem in Bn, and the orbit decidability problem for every subgroup [formula]. As a consequence, we deduce that the conjugacy problem is solvable in certain extensions of Bn.

Theorem [\ref=tcp]. The twisted conjugacy problem is solvable in the braid group Bn.

Theorem [\ref=od]. Every finitely generated subgroup [formula] is orbit decidable.

Theorem [\ref=cp]. Let [formula] be an extension of the braid group Bn by a finitely generated group H satisfying conditions (ii) and (iii) above (for instance, take H torsion-free hyperbolic). Then, G has solvable conjugacy problem.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we review some known facts about normal forms for braids that will be used later. In Section 3 we determine a well defined finite subset of each ε-twisted conjugacy class in Bn. And in Section 4 we give an algorithm to construct such set from a given element in the class, solving the twisted conjugacy problem in Bn. Finally, in Section 5 we solve the orbit decidability problem for subgroups of Aut(Bn) and conclude Theorem [\ref=cp].

Normal forms of braids

In this section we will recall the notion of normal form for braids, as explained in [\cite=Thurston] and [\cite=EM], and we shall also provide some technical lemmas that will be used to prove our main results.

In the braid group Bn, an element is called positive if it can be written as a product of non-negative powers of the generators [formula]. It turns out that if we regard the standard presentation of the braid group ([\ref=E:presentation]) as a monoid presentation, it yields a monoid B+n which embeds in Bn, and is precisely the submonoid of positive braids [\cite=Garside]. This means that two positive words represent the same braid if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of the following operations: Either replacing a subword σiσj by σjσi for |i - j| > 1, or replacing a subword σiσjσi by σjσiσj for |i - j| = 1.

There is a partial order [formula] on the elements of Bn, called the prefix order, defined by [formula] if and only if a- 1b is positive. If a and b are positive this means that b can be written as a positive word in which a appears as a prefix. There is also a suffix order, [formula], defined by [formula] if and only if ab- 1 is positive. These orders are known to be lattice orders, meaning that for every a,b∈Bn there is a unique greatest common divisor [formula] (resp. [formula]) and a unique least common multiple [formula] (resp. [formula]) with respect to [formula] (resp. [formula]).

The order [formula] is, by definition, invariant under left-multiplication. That is, [formula] for all a,b,c∈Bn. This implies that [formula] and [formula] for all c,x,y∈Bn. Similarly, [formula] is invariant under right-multiplication, and one has [formula] and [formula] for all c,x,y∈Bn.

The braid group Bn has a special element called Garside element or half twist,

[formula]

Conjugation by Δ preserves [formula] and [formula]. We denote by τ the inner automorphism of Bn defined by Δ, that is, τ(x) = Δ- 1xΔ for all x∈Bn. We recall that the center of Bn is infinite cyclic, generated by Δ2. Hence τ preserves [formula] and [formula] (thus it preserves [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]), and τ2  =  .

The set of positive prefixes of Δ, denoted [formula], is called the set of simple elements of Bn. This set is finite, namely it has n! elements. Simple elements are the building blocks that conform the usual normal forms of braids. A simple element will be said to be proper if it is neither 1 nor Δ.

The right complement ∂(s) of a simple element s is a simple element t such that st = Δ, that is, ∂(s) = s- 1Δ. The map ∂ is a bijection of the set of simple elements. Moreover, ∂2  =  τ. The left complement of a simple element is precisely ∂- 1(s) = Δs- 1. If a positive element is written as a product of two simple elements s1s2, we say that such a decomposition is left weighted if s1 is the maximal simple prefix of s1s2, that is [formula], or alternatively (multiplying from the left by s- 11), if [formula]. We say that the decomposition s1s2 is right weighted if s2 is the maximal simple suffix of s1s2, that is [formula], or alternatively (multiplying from the right by s- 12), if [formula].

Given an element x∈Bn, we say that a decomposition [formula] is the left normal form of x if p is the maximal integer such that Δ- px is positive, each xi is a proper simple element, and xixi + 1 is left weighted for [formula]. We say that a decomposition [formula] is the right normal form of x if p is the maximal integer such that xΔ- p is positive, each xi' is a proper simple element, and xi'xi + 1' is right weighted for [formula]. The left and right normal forms are unique decompositions, and the numbers p and r are determined by x and do not depend on the normal form (left or right) which is used to define them. In this way, one defines the infimum, supremum and canonical length of x as, respectively, inf (x) = p, sup (x) = p + r and [formula].

It will be convenient for our purposes to use the following notation. When we deal with a positive element x, and we say that its left normal form is [formula], (with no power of Δ on the left), we are allowing some of the initial factors to be equal to Δ. That is, if inf (x) = p > 0, this will mean that [formula], so the actual normal form of x would be [formula].

There is still another normal form that we shall use. It is well known [\cite=Thurston] [\cite=Charney] that, for every x∈Bn there exist unique positive elements u and v, with [formula], such that x = u- 1v. If the left normal forms of u and v are, respectively, [formula] and [formula], the mixed normal form of x is defined to be [formula]. We recall from [\cite=Thurston] that, if x can be written as x = u- 1v with u and v positive elements with left normal forms [formula] and [formula], then [formula] is the mixed normal form of x if and only if [formula].

We remark [\cite=Thurston] that if [formula] is in mixed normal form as above, the left normal form of u- 1 is [formula] (where ui' = ∂- 2i - 1(ui)), and the left normal form of x is equal to [formula]. Therefore, from the mixed normal form one can already obtain inf (x) =  - r, [formula] and hence sup (x) = s.

The following technical results will be used later.

Let a and b be positive braids whose left normal forms are [formula], [formula], and whose right normal forms are [formula], [formula]. Consider x = a- 1b. If [formula] for some integer k  >  0, then either [formula] or [formula].

Let [formula], and write a = dα and b = dβ. Then x = a- 1b = α- 1β, where α and β are positive elements such that [formula]. Hence [formula]. This implies that either sup (α) + k  ≤   sup (a) or sup (β) + k  ≤   sup (b).

Suppose that sup (α) + k  ≤   sup (a) = r. This means that α can be written as a product of at most r - k simple elements. But [formula], where the latter decomposition is in right normal form. It follows that α must be a suffix of [formula], and then [formula]. Hence [formula]. Since the latter decomposition is in left normal form, one finally obtains [formula]. In the case sup (β) + k  ≤   sup (b) = s, one can apply the above reasoning to β and b, to obtain [formula].

Let us denote by ε the automorphism of Bn that sends σi to σ- 1i for [formula]. Also, let :  Bn  →  Bn be the anti-automorphism that sends each σi to itself, that is, it sends a braid represented by a word w, to the braid represented by the same word written backwards. We will write, for every x∈Bn, [formula]. Let us also denote :  Bn  →  Bn the anti-automorphism (x) = x- 1. Notice that the composition of any two of the maps in {ε,,}, in any order, yields the third one.

Let x be a positive braid with sup (x) = r + k, where r  ≥  k  ≥  1. If [formula] then there exist positive braids a and b such that [formula] and sup (b)  ≤  r.

Let [formula] be the left normal form of x and let [formula] be its right normal form. Hence [formula] is the right normal form of [formula] and [formula] is its left normal form. Notice that [formula]. Hence, if [formula], Lemma [\ref=L:cancelling] tells us that either [formula] or [formula].

Suppose that [formula], and write [formula] for some positive α. Since r  ≥  k, one can then write

[formula]

so the result follows in this case taking [formula] and [formula] (if k = r then b = α). Notice that sup (b)  ≤  r as b is a suffix of [formula].

Now suppose that [formula], and write [formula] for some positive β, which is equivalent to [formula]. Then [formula]. Taking [formula] and [formula], which is a prefix of [formula], the result follows also in this case.

We define a palindromic-free braid as a positive braid x that cannot be decomposed as [formula] for positive braids a and b, where a is nontrivial (see the equivalent definition [\ref=D:palindromic_free]). Palindromic-free braids will be crucial to show our main results. The above Lemma implies the following.

Let u be a positive braid with [formula]. Then [formula]. If moreover u is palindromic-free and m > 1, then [formula].

Recall that [formula]. Since the canonical length of a braid is preserved under reversing (by symmetry of the relations in Bn) and also under taking inverses (by [\cite=EM]), it follows that [formula]. Multiplying two braids of canonical length m yields a braid of canonical length at most 2m, hence [formula].

If u is palindromic-free and m > 1 we have the equality, as if we had [formula], then by setting r = m - 1 and k = 1, we would have [formula], which by Lemma [\ref=L:sup_and_palindromic] implies that x is not palindromic-free.

ε-twisted conjugacy and palindromic-free braids

Due to Theorem [\ref=out], the twisted conjugacy problem in Bn will easily reduce to the ε-twisted conjugacy problem, namely given two braids u,v∈Bn decide whether there exists another one w∈Bn such that

[formula]

This problem has a very particular nature because [formula], i.e. ε-twisted conjugating u by w amounts to multiply u on the right by w and on the left by [formula], [formula]. Let us concentrate on this case, where the twisting is given by ε.

Note that the ε-twisted conjugation of a positive braid by a positive braid yields a positive braid. Also, note that, for any braid x∈Bn and any generator σi, x and σixσi are ε-twisted conjugated. Imposing positivity, this yields to the following definition:

A positive braid x is said to be palindromic-free if σ- 1ixσ- 1i is not positive, for every [formula].

In other words, if x is a positive, palindromic-free braid and [formula], that is, x = σiy for some positive y, then [formula]. However, notice that even if x is palindromic-free, one may have simultaneously [formula] and [formula] for some i. For instance if x = σi, or if x = σiσj with [formula].

Every braid x∈Bn is ε-twisted conjugated to some positive, palindromic-free braid y.

It is well known that for every braid x∈Bn, the braid xΔp is positive for p big enough. Since [formula] is positive (actually [formula]), it follows that [formula] is positive for some p big enough. Hence x is ε-twisted conjugated to a positive braid z.

If z is not palindromic-free, there will exist a letter σi such that z = σiz'σi for some positive braid z' whose word length is smaller than that of z. And, since [formula], z is ε-twisted conjugated to z'. Repeating this process, as the word length of the resulting braid decreases at each step, one finally obtains a palindromic-free positive braid ε-twisted conjugated to z, thus to x.

By the above argument, every positive braid x has the form [formula] for some positive, palindromic-free braid y. We remark that the element y is not unique. For instance, if x = σ2σ1σ2  =  σ1σ2σ1, then y could be equal to either σ1 or σ2. Another example is x = σ3σ2σ1σ2σ3  =  σ3σ1σ2σ1σ3  =  σ1σ2σ3σ2σ1, so y could be equal, in this case, to either σ1 or σ2 or σ3.

Recall that we are trying to find an algorithm to solve the ε-twisted conjugacy problem in Bn. After the above discussion, one may think that a possible solution could be to compute the set of positive, palindromic-free braids, ε-twisted conjugated to a given one. Clearly, two braids u and v are ε-twisted conjugated if and only if their corresponding sets coincide. Unfortunately, this attempt does not work because the mentioned set is not always finite, as one can see in the following example.

The set {σn3σ2σ3σ4σ5σ1σ2σ3σ4σn1;  n  ≥  0}  ⊂  B6 is an infinite family of positive, palindromic-free braids, which are pairwise ε-twisted conjugated.

We will show that for every n  ≥  0 one has:

[formula]

So all braids in the above family are ε-twisted conjugated to σ2σ3σ4σ5σ1σ2σ3σ4, and so to each other. To see this, first notice that

[formula]

On the other hand, by commutativity relations,

[formula]

hence

[formula]

Therefore, as σ1, σ3 and σ5 commute, one has

[formula]

and the claim follows.

It just remains to show that every element in the above family is palindromic-free. This could be easily done by using the standard topological representation of braids as collections of strands in [formula], but we will show it algebraically.

If n = 0, we have the braid α0  =  σ2σ3σ4σ5σ1σ2σ3σ4. We recall that the monoid B+6 of positive braids embeds in B6, so we just need to use positive relations from the standard presentation ([\ref=E:presentation]) to determine which generators are prefixes or suffixes of α0. But notice that in the above word, no matter how many commutativity relations we apply, we can never obtain a subword of the form σiσjσi, because between two appearances of the letter σi one always has both σi - 1 and σi + 1. Hence, only commutativity relations can be applied, and it follows that this braid can only start with σ2, and can only end with σ4, thus it is palindromic-free.

For n > 0, the braid we are considering is αn  =  σn3(σ2σ3σ4σ5σ1σ2σ3σ4)σn1. Notice that:

[formula]

Hence αn  =  σ2n3(σ2σ3σ4σ5σ1σ2σ3σ4), and also αn = (σ2σ3σ4σ5σ1σ2σ3σ4)σ2n1.

On one hand, the above two expressions of αn show that it can start with σ3 and also with σ2. Suppose that it can also start with σ1. As [formula] and we are assuming that [formula], it follows that [formula], that is [formula]. Multiplying by σ- 2n3 from the left we obtain [formula]. But this is not possible as the latter braid can only start with σ2. Hence [formula]. Analogously, as [formula], and also [formula], it follows that [formula] and [formula]. Therefore αn can only start with either σ2 or σ3.

The symmetric argument shows that αn can only end with either σ1 or σ4. Therefore αn is palindromic-free, as we wanted to show.

Hence, the attempt to compute the set of all positive, palindromic-free braids, ε-twisted conjugated to a given one does not work. However, we shall save the idea by imposing a further condition which will assure the required finiteness of the set: we shall consider only elements with minimal canonical length. The set we will compute is then the following.

Given a braid x∈Bn, we define MPF(x) to be the set of positive, palindromic-free braids, ε-twisted conjugated to x, of minimal canonical length.

Notice that if a positive braid x is palindromic-free, then inf (x) = 0, so [formula]. This gives us finiteness of MPF(x):

For every x∈Bn, the set MPF(x) is nonempty and finite, and it is an invariant of its ε-twisted conjugacy class.

MPF(x) is an invariant of the ε-twisted conjugacy class of x by definition. It is nonempty by Proposition [\ref=P:MPF_nonempty], and it is finite since the set of elements of infimum zero, and given canonical length, is finite.

The twisted conjugacy problem for Bn.

In order to find a solution to the ε-twisted conjugacy problem in braid groups, we need a method to compute MPF(x), given x∈Bn. For that purpose, we shall need the following technical results.

Let u be a positive, palindromic-free braid. Let c be a positive braid with inf (c) = 0, whose left normal form is [formula]. Denote [formula]. Then ki + 1  ≤  ki + 1 for [formula]. In particular, [formula] for [formula].

Recall that, since u is palindromic-free, inf (u) = 0. As the infimum of an element can increase by at most one when multiplied by a simple element, one has either inf (uc1) = 0 or inf (uc1) = 1.

Suppose that inf (uc1) = 0, that is, Δ is not a prefix of uc1. It is well known that, as [formula] is in left normal form, then [formula]. Since the infimum of an element can increase by at most one when it is multiplied by a simple element, one has [formula], moreover [formula] for [formula]. It suffices then to show that [formula] for [formula]. But since we already showed that [formula], and [formula] is in left normal form, then Δp is a prefix of [formula] (necessarily p  ≤  i) if and only if it is a prefix of [formula]. Hence [formula] for [formula], as we wanted to show.

Now suppose that inf (uc1) = 1, that is, uc1  =  vΔ for some positive v, prefix of u. This means that u = v∂- 1(c1). Since u is palindromic-free, one has [formula]. But it is easy to see that [formula], so one has [formula], that is, the decomposition [formula] is left-weighted as written. This in particular implies that [formula] and, since [formula] is in right normal form, that [formula]. Hence [formula]. As the infimum can increase by at most one when an element is multiplied by a simple one, then one has [formula], moreover [formula] for [formula]. Repeating the argument of the previous case, one has [formula] for [formula], and the result is shown.

Let u be a positive, palindromic-free braid. Let c be a positive braid with inf (c) = 0, and whose left normal form is [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] for [formula].

Let [formula] for [formula]. We know that k0 = 0 since u is palindromic-free, and that ki + 1  ≤  ki + 1 by the previous result. By induction on s, it follows that ks  ≤  s and the equality holds if and only if ki + 1 = ki + 1 for [formula]. But we have ks = s by hypothesis, hence ki = i for [formula], as we wanted to show.

Let u,v∈Bn be positive, palindromic-free braids. Let a and b be nontrivial positive braids such that [formula] (hence inf (a) =  inf (b) = 0). Suppose that [formula]. Then [formula].

Denote [formula] and [formula], and write [formula] and [formula] in right normal forms. Consider b* = b- 1Δq. Then b* is a positive braid with inf (b*) = 0. Namely, its right normal form is [formula]. Then consider the product

[formula]

We claim that the above decomposition is the right normal form of ab*. We just need to show that ap∂(bq) is right-weighted as written. But [formula], so [formula], which precisely means that ap∂(bq) is right-weighted, showing the claim. This implies in particular that inf (ab*) = 0 and [formula].

Notice that [formula]. Since inf (v) = 0 as v is palindromic free, one has [formula]. On the other hand, inf (ab*) = 0 and [formula], so Lemma [\ref=L:increasing_inf] implies that [formula]. Therefore 2q  ≤  p + q, that is, q  ≤  p. By symmetry, one also has p  ≤  q, so the equality holds.

Recall that we want to find a method to compute, for any given braid x∈Bn, the set MPF(x) i.e. the (finite) set of positive, palindromic-free, ε-twisted conjugates of x of minimal canonical length. Notice that if two elements u and v are ε-twisted conjugated, that is, if [formula] for some braid c, then we can multiply on both sides by a suitable power of Δ such that cΔp is positive, in such a way that [formula], so we have written [formula] with A and B positive. Moreover, if [formula] is the maximal common suffix of A and B, then multiplying the above equality from the right by d- 1 and from the left by [formula], we finally get [formula], with a and b positive and such that [formula], as in the hypothesis of the above result. We will be specially interested in the case in which a and b are simple elements.

We will say that two elements u,v∈Bn are simply ε-twisted conjugated, or that they are related by a simple ε-twisted conjugation, if there exist simple elements a and b such that [formula].

The main result of this section is analogous, with respect to ε-twisted conjugacy, to the following famous result by El-Rifai and Morton with respect to conjugacy.

Let u,v∈Bn be conjugated braids such that [formula] and [formula] for some r. Then there is a chain [formula], with [formula] for all i, such that ui - 1 is conjugated to ui by a simple element, for [formula]. Namely, if c is a positive element such that c- 1uc = v, and [formula] is its left normal form, then one can take [formula].

In our case, dealing with ε-twisted conjugacy, we will restrict to positive, palindromic-free braids.

Let u,v∈Bn be positive, palindromic-free, ε-twisted conjugated braids such that [formula] and [formula] for some r. Then there is a chain [formula] of positive, palindromic-free braids, with [formula] for all i, such that ui - 1 is simply ε-twisted conjugated to ui, for [formula].

As we saw above, there are positive elements a and b, with [formula], such that [formula]. Since u and v are palindromic free, a is trivial if and only if so is b. If a and b are nontrivial, the hypotheses of Corollary [\ref=C:equal_length] are satisfied, thus [formula] in any case. We will show the result by induction on p. If p = 0 the result is trivially true, so we will assume that p > 0 and that the result is true for all values between 0 and p - 1.

The strategy of the proof will be to find some palindromic-free braid w with [formula], such that [formula] for some simple braids s and t (this is a chain of length 1 from u to w), and also [formula] for some positive elements y,z such that [formula] and [formula]. The induction hypothesis provides a chain from w to v, so the result will follow by concatenating both chains.

We start as in the proof of Corollary [\ref=C:equal_length], defining b* = b- 1Δp, and noticing that inf (ab*) = 0, [formula] and [formula]. Denote c = ab*, and let [formula] be its left normal form. Then [formula]. Since v is palindromic-free, thus inf (v) = 0, one has [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=C:increasing_inf] one has [formula] for [formula]. In particular [formula], hence [formula] for some positive braid w'.

Multiplying the above equality on the right by c- 12 and on the left by its reverse, we obtain [formula]. Hence u and w' are simply ε-twisted conjugated. But w' is not necessarily palindromic-free, and one does not necessarily have [formula]. Let us see that we can replace w' by some w that satisfies the required hypothesis.

Recall that [formula]. Since the left hand side is a product of at most r + 4 simple elements, it follows that sup (w')  ≤  r + 2. Moreover, multiplying each side of the equality, from the left, by its image under ε, one has

[formula]

Hence:

[formula]

Since [formula], one obtains:

[formula]

In the same way, from the equality

[formula]

one gets:

[formula]

Recall that [formula] and [formula], so by Corollary [\ref=C:pal-free_double_length] one has [formula] and [formula], thus [formula]. Therefore, by Theorem [\ref=T:EM], [formula]. Hence [formula].

We claim that there are positive braids x and w, such that [formula] and sup (w)  ≤  r. First, if sup (w')  ≤  r one can take x = 1 and w = w'. Second, if sup (w') = r + 1, notice that r  ≥  1 and [formula], so the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=L:sup_and_palindromic], taking k = 1. We must then show the claim in the case sup (w') = r + 2.

Suppose that sup (w') = r + 2, and recall that [formula]. If sup (w')  ≥  4, the claim follows from Lemma [\ref=L:sup_and_palindromic], taking k = 2. Therefore the only remaining case is sup (w') = 3, r = 1 and [formula]. Let [formula] and write w' = dα and (w') = dβ. Notice that ε(w')w'  =  (w')- 1w'  =  β- 1d- 1dα, hence the mixed normal form of ε(w')w' is precisely β- 1α. Moreover, since the word length of w' and (w') coincide, one has α = 1 if and only if β = 1. Hence, since [formula], one must necessarily have either sup (α) =  sup (β) = 0 or sup (α) =  sup (β) = 1, that is, α and β are (possibly trivial) simple elements.

Write w' = a1a2a3 in left normal form. The right normal form of (w') is then [formula]. Since (w') = dβ and β is simple, it follows that [formula], hence [formula]. Since the latter decomposition is in left normal form, one has [formula], and also [formula]. Write then [formula] for some positive c. Now if ca2 is simple we are done, as one can take x = a3 and w = ca2. Otherwise, write ca2  =  b1b2 in left normal form, and recall that [formula], so [formula]. Then [formula]. On the other hand, since ca2 = b1b2 and the latter decomposition is left weighted, one has [formula] and then [formula]. Concatenating the last two inequalities, one finally obtains [formula]. Therefore one can write [formula] for some simple element w, and one has [formula]. Taking x = b2a3, the claim is shown.

Notice that if w is not palindromic-free, we can still decompose [formula] where y is positive and w'' is palindromic-free. Moreover, sup (w'')  ≤   sup (w)  ≤  r. Therefore, replacing x by yx and w by w'' if necessary, we can assume that [formula], where x is positive and w is palindromic-free with sup (w)  ≤  r.

Now recall that [formula] for simple elements c1 and c2. By the above claim, [formula]. Multiplying this equality from the right by [formula] and from the left by its reverse, we obtain [formula] for positive braids s and t such that [formula]. Now s is simple as it is a prefix of c1, hence t is simple by Corollary [\ref=C:equal_length]. Therefore u and w are simply ε-twisted conjugated, positive, palindromic-free braids, whose canonical length is at most r. This is the first step of our required chain.

Now notice that

[formula]

Hence

[formula]

For simplicity, we will denote di  =  τ- 1(ci + 2) for [formula]. Hence we have:

[formula]

Recalling that [formula], and multiplying the above equality from the right by [formula] and from the left by its reverse, we finally obtain:

[formula]

where [formula] are simple elements and [formula]. Reducing the above equality, if necessary, by the biggest common suffix of [formula] and [formula], it follows that there exist positive braids y and z such that [formula], and [formula]. Recall that w and v are palindromic-free and, by Corollary [\ref=C:equal_length] and as z is a prefix of [formula], [formula]. Therefore the induction hypothesis provides the remaining part of the required chain, and the result is shown.

Let u,v∈Bn be positive, palindromic-free, ε-twisted conjugated braids of minimal canonical length in their ε-twisted conjugacy class, say [formula]. Then there is a chain [formula] of positive, palindromic-free braids, with canonical length [formula] for all i, such that ui - 1 is simply ε-twisted conjugated to ui, for [formula].

There exists an algorithm to compute MPF(x) for any given braid x∈Bn.

If x = 1 then MPF(x) = {1}. So, let us assume x  ≠  1.

First of all, compute a positive, palindromic-free, ε-twisted conjugate of x, say y, as it is explained in Proposition [\ref=P:MPF_nonempty]. Let [formula], and let S = {y}  ⊂  Bn.

Now, consider the following operation, which will have to be subsequently applied until all elements in S have been processed:

Choose z∈S which has not been processed, compute all positive palindromic-free elements which are simply ε-twisted conjugated to z and have canonical length less than or equal to r (this is clearly a finite, computable set), and then do the following: 1) if one of them, say z', has length less than r, kill the whole process, reset y = z', S = {z'}, [formula] and start the algorithm again; 2) otherwise, add to S all the computed elements (which have canonical length exactly equal to r), and mark z as processed.

At each application of such operation, either the set S gets restarted and r strictly decreased, or the set S gets increased by the addition of the new elements computed (some of which could already be present in the former S). But [formula] can only decrease a finite number of times, and |S| can only increase a finite number of times, since the number of braids with infimum zero and given canonical length is finite (recall that palindromic-free elements have infimum zero).

Hence, after a finite number of applications of the previous operation (running over all elements z∈S), we shall get a set [formula] closed under this operation, i.e. such that when applying that operation to any z∈S the set neither gets restarted nor gets increased (that is, all the elements computed are already present in S). At this time, Theorem [\ref=T:twisted_EM] implies that the canonical length of the elements in S (which is constant) is the smallest possible among all positive palindromic-free braids which are ε-twisted conjugated to x. That is, S  ⊆  MPF(x).

Now, let u∈MPF(x). Choosing an arbitrary v∈S, Corollary [\ref=bottom] tells us that u and v are connected by a chain of positive, palindromic-free braids of minimal canonical length, each simply ε-twisted conjugated to the following one. Hence, by construction of S, we have u∈S. Therefore, S = MPF(x).

The twisted conjugacy problem is solvable in the braid group Bn.

Suppose we are given an automorphism φ:Bn  →  Bn (by the images of the generators), and two braids u,v∈Bn. We have to decide whether there exists x∈Bn such that v = (φ(x))- 1ux, and in the positive case compute such an x.

By Theorem [\ref=out], either φ is a conjugation (φ  =  γw for some w∈Bn), or it is ε followed by a conjugation (φ  =  γwε for some w∈Bn). We can clearly make this decision effective, and compute such a w. Indeed, in order to check whether φ  =  γw, we need to find some braid w such that w- 1σiw = φ(σi) for [formula]. This is an instance of the so-called multiple simultaneous conjugacy problem in Bn, and algorithms to solve it (and to find such w) can be found in [\cite=Lee_Lee] [\cite=GM]. On the other hand, checking whether φ  =  γwε and finding such w reduces to solving another instance of the multiple simultaneous conjugacy problem in Bn: namely, it amounts to find w such that w- 1σ- 1iw = φ(σi) for [formula]. (Alternatively, in our specific situation, we can make the following conceptually much easier brute force algorithm: knowing, by Theorem [\ref=out], that there exists w∈Bn such that either w- 1σiw = φ(σi) for [formula], or w- 1σ- 1iw = φ(σi) for [formula], one can always enumerate all words w∈Bn and keep checking both conditions until finding the good one with the correct w.) We can therefore assume that w is known, and that φ is equal either to γw or to γwε.

In the first case φ(x) = w- 1xw, and the equation v = (φ(x))- 1ux is equivalent to wv = x- 1(wu)x. Deciding the existence of such an x and finding it, is just an instance of the standard conjugacy problem in Bn (applied to wv and wu), which is well-known to be solvable, see Theorem [\ref=cpbn].

In the second case, φ(x) = w- 1ε(x)w, and the equation v = (φ(x))- 1ux is equivalent to [formula]. Deciding the existence of such an x and finding it, is an instance of the ε-twisted conjugacy problem in Bn (applied to wv and wu), which can be solved by computing the sets MPF(wu) and MPF(wv) (see Corollary [\ref=computeMPF]) and checking whether they coincide or not (meaning that wu and wv are or are not ε-twisted conjugated, respectively). Notice that, during the computations of MPF(wu) and MPF(wv), we can keep track of a ε-twisted conjugating element at each step, so that we can explicitly find a value for x in the case it exists.

We remark that the full computation of the sets MPF(wu) and MPF(wv) will usually not be necessary. We can start the construction of both sets simultaneously, and kill the whole process giving a positive answer, as soon as we find an element z in common in both sets (since, in this case, both wu and wv are ε-twisted conjugated to z, an so to each other).

The conjugacy problem for some extensions of Bn.

Every finitely generated subgroup [formula] is orbit decidable.

Let [formula] be given, and consider [formula]. For every [formula], compute wi∈Bn and εi = 0,1 such that φi  =  γwiεεii (see the first part of the proof of Theorem [\ref=tcp]).

Given two braids u,v∈Bn we have to decide whether or not v is conjugated to α(u) for some α∈A. If εi = 0 for every i, then [formula] and so, the set {α(u)|α∈A} is a certain collection of conjugates of u. In this case, our problem just consists on deciding whether or not v is conjugated to u. This is doable by Theorem [\ref=cpbn].

Otherwise, the set {α(u)|α∈A} is a certain collection of conjugates of u and of ε(u). In this case, our problem just consists on deciding whether or not v is conjugated to either u or ε(u). This is again doable by two applications of Theorem [\ref=cpbn].

The following theorem (and the interesting particular case expressed in the corollary below) are immediate consequences of Theorems [\ref=ses], [\ref=tcp], and [\ref=od].

Let [formula] be an extension of the braid group Bn by a finitely generated group H satisfying conditions (ii) and (iii) above (for instance, take H torsion-free hyperbolic). Then, G has solvable conjugacy problem. [formula]

For any [formula], the group

[formula]

has solvable conjugacy problem. [formula]
