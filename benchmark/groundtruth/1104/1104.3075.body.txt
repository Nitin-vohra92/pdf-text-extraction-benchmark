Allocation of seats in the European Parliament and a degressive proportionality.

Introduction

The European Parliament is one of the most important institutions of the European Union based on representations of members states. Principles of seats distribution in The EP have changed with subsequent EU enlargement stages. Due to large distribution of population between individual member states, no proportional method can be employed in seat distribution. Therefore another approach to apportionment was postulated. The postulate was expressed in Article 9a paragraph 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon. The article states that:

,,The European Parliament shall be composed of representatives of the Union's citizens. They shall not exceed seven hundred and fifty in number, plus the President. Representations of citizens shall be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members per Member State. No Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats".(Treaty of Lisbon [\cite=lisbon]).

-1 The meaning of the concept of degressive proportionality can be found in two principles annexed to the draft of European Parliament resolution. The first, referred as the principle of fair division, states that ,,the larger the population of a Member State, the greater is entitlement to a large number of seats". The other condition, referred to as the principle of relative proportionality, holds that ,,the larger the population of a country, the more inhabitants are represented by each of its Members of the EU". (Lamassoure and Severin [\cite=lamssoure]). A formal approach to the definition of degeressive proportionality was studied by Ramirez-Palmarez-Marquez [\cite=ramirez] and Lyko-Cegiełka-Dniestrzaski-Misztal [\cite=lyko]. Let n represent the number of Members States, li - the population of the i-th member, and mi - the number of mandates offered to the Member State. Suppose that [formula]. Then the sequence mi is degressively proportional with respect to the sequence li if it is non-increasing and satisfies the following condition:

[formula]

The present composition of the European Parliament does not satisfy the principles of the degressive proportionality. Distribution of seats in the European Parliament postulated by Committee on Constitutional Affairs members Lamassoure and Severin does indeed fulfill the requirements of degressive proportionality. The main problem is to find a clear and fair method (acceptable for all Member States) which determines uniquely a sequence mi degressively proportional with respect to li.

For a real number x we denote by [formula] the least integer ≥  x. All the following sequences are sequences of length n or n - 1, where [formula] is a fixed number. The definition of degressive proportionality can be slightly extended as follows. Let li be any fixed non-increasing sequence of real positive numbers. We say that a sequence of natural numbers mi is degressively proportional with respect to the sequence li, if mi is non-increasing and

[formula]

It Theorem 1(a) we prove that a sequence of natural numbers mi is degressively proportional with respect to li if and only if it is defined inductively

[formula]

for some sequence ai  ≥  0 and a constant [formula]. Note that a sequence Mi defined inductively in Theorem 1(b) is degressively proportional with respect to li and is smaller, then any other such sequence with the first element ≥  M. The pair (M,{ai}) will be called the initial condition for the sequence mi.

Fix constants [formula] such that [formula]. We suggest the following method of the choice of a sequence mi degressively proportional with respect to li and satisfying the inequalities

[formula]

Fix a sequence ai  ≥  0. For every [formula], let mi(c) denote the degressively proportional sequence with respect to li, with the initial condition (M,{cai}). In Theorem 2(a) we prove that all the functions mi:c   ↦   mi(c), 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, and the function [formula], are left-continuous and non-decreasing on the positive half line

[formula]

A(c) ≤ A(x) ≤ A(c) + + (x-c) a ≤ ⌈ A(c)⌉.

[formula]

A(c) ≤ A(x) = A(c) + (x-c) a ≤ ⌈ A(c)⌉

[formula]

⌈ A(c)⌉ < A(x) = A(c) + + (x-c) a ≤ ⌈ A(c)⌉ + 1,

A(x)= { .

[formula]

m(x) = min (⌈ A(x)⌉, m(x)) =min (⌈ A(c)⌉, m(c)) = m(c).

Examples

Recall that for a real number x we denote by ⌊x⌋8 the decimal representation of x up to eight digits after the decimal point. Suppose [formula] is the sequence of populations of Member States of the European Parliament. Let mi(c), c  ≥  0, be a degressively proportional sequence with respect to li, with the initial condition (96,{c}), and [formula].

Suppose we want to find 1.11  <  c2  <  c3, such that Φ(1.11), Φ(c2), Φ(c3) are consecutive values of Φ. This can be accomplished in the following steps :

Set c1  =  1.11. Find ⌊β(c1)⌋8 (cf. Table 3).

Set d1  =  c1  +  ⌊β(c1)⌋8. Find ⌊γ(d1)⌋8 (cf. Table 4).

Set c2  =  d1  +  ⌊γ(d1)⌋8. Find ⌊β(c2)⌋8 (cf. Table 5).

Set d2  =  c2  +  ⌊β(c2)⌋8. Find ⌊γ(d2)⌋8 (cf. Table 6).

Set c3  =  d2  +  ⌊γ(d2)⌋8. Find ⌊β(c3)⌋8 (cf. Table 7).

Set d3  =  c3  +  ⌊β(c3)⌋8.

By Theorem 5, Φ is constant on the interval
