On the Coupling Property and the Liouville Theorem for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes

Main Results

Let [formula] be an n-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is defined as the unique strong solution of the following stochastic differential equation

[formula]

Here A is a real n  ×  n matrix, B is a real n  ×  d matrix and Zt is a Lévy process in [formula]; note that we allow Zt to take values in a proper subspace of [formula]. It is well known that

[formula]

The characteristic exponent or symbol Φ of Zt, defined by

[formula]

enjoys the following Lévy-Khintchine representation:

[formula]

where Q = (qj,k)dj,k = 1 is a positive semi-definite matrix, [formula] is the drift vector and ν is the Lévy measure, i.e. a σ-finite measure on [formula] such that [formula]. For every ε > 0, define νε on [formula] as follows:

Let [formula] be a Markov process on [formula] with transition function Pt(x,  ·  ). Then, according to [\cite=Li] [\cite=T] [\cite=SW], we say that [formula] admits a successful coupling (also: enjoys the coupling property) if for any [formula], where [formula] stands for the total variation norm. If a Markov process admits a successful coupling, then it also has the Liouville property, i.e. every bounded harmonic function is constant; in this context a function f is harmonic, if Lf = 0 where L is the generator of the Markov process. See [\cite=CG] [\cite=CW] and the references therein for this result and more details on the coupling property.

Let A be an n  ×  n matrix. We say that an eigenvalue λ of A is semisimple if the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace is equal to the algebraic multiplicity of λ as a root of characteristic polynomial of A. Note that for symmetric matrices A all eigenvalues are real and semisimple. Recall that for any two bounded measures μ and ν on [formula], [formula], where (μ  -  ν)± refers to the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the signed measure μ  -  ν. In particular, [formula], and [formula]

One of our main results is the following

Let Pt(x,  ·  ) be the transition probability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [formula] given by [\eqref=ou1]. Assume that [formula] (which implies [formula]), and that there exist ε,δ > 0 such that

[formula]

If the real parts of all eigenvalues of A are non-positive and if all purely imaginary eigenvalues are semisimple, then there exists a constant C = C(ε,δ,ν,A,B) > 0 such that for all [formula] and t > 0,

[formula]

As a consequence of Theorem [\ref=th1], we immediately obtain the following result which partly answers the following question about Liouville theorems for non-local operators from [\cite=PZ]: A challenging task would be to apply other probabilistic techniques, based on ... coupling to non-local operators.

Under the conditions of Theorem [\ref=th1], the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [formula] admits a successful coupling and has the Liouville property.

(1) If A = 0, d = n and [formula], then Xt is just a Lévy process on [formula]. The condition [\eqref=th2233] is one possibility to guarantee sufficient jump activity such that the Lévy process Xt admits a successful coupling. To see that [\eqref=th2233] is sharp, we can use the example in [\cite=SW].

(2) Let Zt be a (rotationally symmetric) α-stable Lévy process Zt, 0 < α < 2, and denote by Xt the n-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by Zt, i.e.

[formula]

If at least one eigenvalue of A has positive real part, then Xt does not have the coupling property. Indeed, according to [\cite=PZ], we know that Xt does not have the Liouville property, i.e. there exists a bounded harmonic function which is not constant. According to [\cite=Li] or [\cite=CG], Xt does not have the coupling property. This example indicates that the non-positivity of the real parts of the eigenvalues of A is also necessary.

In [\cite=SW] we show that Lévy processes which have the strong Feller property admit the coupling property. A similar conclusion, however, does not hold for general Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Consider, for instance, the one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process given by

[formula]

where Zt is an α-stable Lévy process Zt on [formula]. According to [\cite=PZ2] (or [\cite=NS]) and [\cite=PZ2], we know that Xt has the strong Feller property. However, the argument used in Remark [\ref=remarkth1] shows that this process fails to have the coupling property.

Recently, F.-Y. Wang [\cite=wang1] has studied the coupling property of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process Xt defined by [\eqref=ou1]. Assume that [formula] and [formula] holds for [formula]. In [\cite=wang1] it is proved that [\eqref=th21] is satisfied for some constant C > 0, whenever the Lévy measure of Zt satisfies [formula] such that

[formula]

holds for some [formula] and some ε > 0.

Let us compare F.-Y. Wang's result with our Theorem [\ref=th1].

Assume that [\eqref=wang22] holds for some [formula], some [formula] and some ε > 0. Then, there exist a closed subset [formula] and a constant δ > 0 such that

[formula]

We postpone the technical proof of Proposition [\ref=improvement] to Section [\ref=subsec-appendix2] in the appendix. Proposition [\ref=improvement] shows that Theorem [\ref=th1] improves [\cite=wang1], even if the Lévy measure ν of Zt has an absolutely continuous component as we will see in the following example.

Let C3 / 4 be a Smith-Volterra-Cantor set in

[formula]

dX=-X dt + dZ,  X=x∈ R,

[formula]

=∞

[formula]

Now we are going to estimate [formula] for large values of t with the help of the characteristic exponent Φ(ξ) of the Lévy process Zt. We restrict ourselves to the case where Q = 0 in [\eqref=ou2], i.e. to Lévy process [formula] without a Gaussian part. For t,ρ > 0, define

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the transpose of the matrix M.

Let Pt(x,  ·  ) be the transition function of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [formula] on [formula] given by [\eqref=ou1]. Assume that there exists some t0  >  0 such that

[formula]

If

[formula]

then there exist t1,C > 0 such that for any [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

In particular, when

[formula]

we only need the condition [\eqref=coup1] to get [\eqref=coup3].

Note that [\eqref=coup4] is, e.g. satisfied, if the real parts of all eigenvalues of A are negative and

[formula]

for some constant κ > 0.

The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section [\ref=section2] we first present the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1], where a coupling for the weighted sum of independent random variables and the explicit expression of the transition semigroup of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by a compound Poisson process are used. Then, we follow the approach of our recent paper [\cite=SSW] to prove Theorem [\ref=coup]. As a byproduct, we also derive explicit gradient estimates for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, cf. the Appendix [\ref=subsec-appendix1].

Proofs of Theorems

We begin with the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1].

The proof is split into six steps. Step 1. For any ε > 0, let [formula] be a compound Poisson process on [formula] whose Lévy measure is νε. Then, [formula] and [formula] are independent Lévy processes. It follows, in particular, that the random variables

[formula]

and

[formula]

are independent for any ε > 0 and [formula].

Step 2. Denote by με,t the law of random variable

[formula]

We will compute με,t, which coincides with the law of [formula], cf. Lemma [\ref=lemmaproofth11] below. Our argument follows the proof of [\cite=PZ2], which is motivated by [\cite=SA].

The law of the compound poisson process Zεt is given by

[formula]

where [formula], ε  =  νε / Cε and * kε is the k-fold convolution of ε.

Construct a sequence [formula] of iid random variables which are exponentially distributed with intensity Cε, and introduce a further sequence [formula] of iid random variables on [formula] with law ε. We will assume that the random variables [formula] are independent of the sequence [formula]. It is not difficult to check that the random variable

[formula]

also has the probability distribution με,t.

Using [\eqref=proofs0] we find for any [formula],

[formula]

where

[formula]

Here [formula] is the probability measure on [formula] which is the image of the k-fold product measure [formula] under the linear transformation [formula] (independent of ε) acting from [formula] into [formula]:

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula].

Step 3. Let Pt(x,  ·  ) and Pt be the transition function and the transition semigroup of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [formula]. Similarly, we denote by Pεt(x,  ·  ) and Pεt the transition function and the transition semigroup of [formula], and by Qεt(x,  ·  ) and Qεt the transition function and the transition semigroup of [formula]. By the independence of the processes [formula] and [formula], we get

[formula]

Furthermore, it follows from [\eqref=proofs1] that

[formula]

Step 4. For any [formula], a  ≠  0, let Ra be the non-degenerate rotation such that Raa = |a|e1. Then, by [\cite=SW],

[formula]

Since [formula] is the law of the random variable

[formula]

[formula] is the law of the random variable

[formula]

To estimate [formula], we will use the Mineka and Lindvall-Rogers couplings for random walks. The remainder of this part is based on the proof of [\cite=SW]. In order to ease notations, we set [formula] and [formula] for any [formula].

Since [formula], there exists a real d  ×  n matrix [formula] such that [formula], see e.g. [\cite=Bern]. For any [formula], let [formula] be a pair of random variables with the following distribution

[formula]

where [formula], [formula] and D is any of the following three sets: { - ai}, {0} or {ai}. Again by [\cite=SW],

[formula]

It is clear that the distribution of Ui is [formula]. Let Ui' = Ui  +  ΔUi. We claim that the distribution of Ui' is also [formula]. Indeed, for any [formula],

[formula]

where we have used that

[formula]

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the pairs (Ui,Ui') are independent for all [formula]. Now we construct the coupling

[formula]

of

[formula]

Since U'i - Ui  =  ΔUi is either ±  ai or 0, we know that

[formula]

is a random walk on [formula] whose steps are symmetrically (but not necessarily identically) distributed and take only the values ±  |etA(x - y)|e1 and 0.

Set [formula] and [formula] for [formula], where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then [formula] is a random walk on [formula] whose steps are independent and attain the values - |etA(x - y)|, 0 and |etA(x - y)| with probabilities [formula], pi and [formula], respectively; the values of the pi are given by

[formula]

Since [formula] for [formula], we get

[formula]

where

[formula]

Step 5. Since the real parts of all eigenvalues of A are non-positive and since all purely imaginary eigenvalues are semisimple, we know from [\cite=Bern] that [formula]. In particular, when [formula],

[formula]

From [\eqref=th2233] we get that for all [formula] and [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

We will now estimate [formula]. Let Vi, [formula], be independent symmetric random variables on [formula], whose distributions are given by

[formula]

Set [formula]. We have seen earlier that

[formula]

For any [formula], let

[formula]

and set [formula], where ṽi denotes the ith Vj such that Vj  ≠  0. Then, k is a symmetric random walk with iid steps which are either - |etA(x - y)| or |etA(x - y)| with probability 1 / 2. Define

[formula]

By [\eqref=proofcon],

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

where [formula], [formula], are independent random variables with [formula] and [formula]. Chebyshev's inequality shows that

[formula]

For the second and the last inequality we have used [\eqref=proofcon].

On the other hand, by Lemma [\ref=lemmaproofth13] below,

[formula]

From the construction above, we know that [formula] is a symmetric random walk with iid steps with values ±  |etA(x - y)|. Using the central limit theorem we find for sufficiently large values of [formula] and some constant C = C(k0)

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=lll1], [\eqref=lll2] and [\eqref=lll3] gives for all [formula] with [formula], [formula] and [formula] that

[formula]

Finally, [\eqref=proofs6] yields for all [formula] with [formula], [formula] and [formula], that

[formula]

Step 6. If we combine [\eqref=proofs2], [\eqref=proofs3] and [\eqref=proofs7], we obtain that for all [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

where the penultimate inequality follows as in [\cite=SW].

For any x, [formula], set [formula]. Pick [formula] such that x0 = x, xk = y and [formula] for [formula]. By [\eqref=proofs8],

[formula]

which finishes the proof of [\eqref=th21].

The following two lemmas have been used in the proof of Theorem [\ref=th1] above. For the sake of completeness we include their proofs.

Let [formula] and [formula] be a d-dimensional Lévy process with characteristic exponent Φ as in [\eqref=ou2]. Then, [formula] is a Lévy process on (a subspace of) [formula], and the corresponding characteristic exponent is

[formula]

The Lévy triplet (QB,bB,νB) of [formula] is given by [formula], νB(C)  =  ν{y:By∈C} and

[formula]

For all [formula] and [formula], we have

[formula]

The assertion follows from [\eqref=ou2] and some straightforward calculations.

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula] be a d-dimensional Lévy process with the characteristic exponent Φ as in [\eqref=ou2]. For all t > 0 the random variables [formula] and [formula] have the same probability distribution. Furthermore, both random variables are infinitely divisible, and the characteristic exponent (log-characteristic function) is given by

[formula]

We first assume that n = d and [formula]. For any t > 0, we can use Lemma [\ref=lemmaproofth12] and follow the proof of [\cite=SA] to deduce

[formula]

for all [formula]. Similarly, for every [formula],

[formula]

Since

[formula]

it follows that [formula] and [formula] have the same law.

Now replace in the preceding calculations A with [formula], [formula], and set [formula]. Denote by Y(j)k, [formula], independent copies of Yk. It is straightforward to see that [formula] and [formula] have the same law. This proves the infinite divisibility.

If n  ≠  d, we consider, as in Lemma [\ref=lemmaproofth12], the Lévy process [formula] on (a subspace of) [formula]. Then, for any [formula],

[formula]

and the claim follows from the first part of our proof.

The following result presents the upper estimate for the distribution of the maximum of a symmetric random walk, by using the reflection principle. Since we could not find a precise reference in the literature, we include the complete proof for the readers' convenience.

Consider a random walk [formula] on [formula] with iid steps, which attain the values - 1, 1 and 0 with probabilities (1 - r) / 2, (1 - r) / 2 and r [formula], respectively. Then for any positive integers a and k, we have

[formula]

and

[formula]

Fix any positive integer a and define [formula]. Since the random walk has iid steps, it is obvious that [formula] and [formula] are independent random walks having the same law. Observing that Sτ  =  a and [formula] we find, therefore,

[formula]

From this we conclude that

[formula]

Since [formula], we see

[formula]

the other inequality follows similarly if we use [formula].

Next, we turn to the proof of Theorem [\ref=coup].

Step 1. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lemmaproofth11] we may, without loss of generality, assume that n = d and [formula]. For t > 0, denote by μt the law of [formula]. According to Lemma [\ref=lemmaproofth11], the law μt is an infinitely divisible probability distribution, and the characteristic exponent of μt is given by

[formula]

Since the driving Lévy process [formula] has no Gaussian part, the Lévy triplet (0,bt,νt) of Φt is given by, cf. [\cite=SAT], For every r > 0, let [formula] be the family of infinitely divisible probability measures on [formula] whose Fourier transform is of the form rt(ξ) =  exp ( - Φt,r(ξ)), where

[formula]

with νt as above.

Set [formula]. Following the proof of [\cite=SSW], the conditions [\eqref=coup1] and [\eqref=coup2] ensure that there exists t1 > 0 such that for all [formula], the measure μh(t)t has a density [formula]; moreover,

[formula]

holds for all [formula].

Step 2. For r > 0 and [formula], define

[formula]

Since Ψt,r is given by a Lévy-Khintchine formula, it is the characteristic exponent of some d-dimensional infinitely divisible random variable. Let [formula] be the family of infinitely divisible measures whose Fourier transforms are of the form rt(ξ) =  exp ( - Ψt,r(ξ)). Clearly, [formula] for all t,r > 0.

Let Pt(x,  ·  ) and Pt be the transition function and the transition semigroup of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [formula] given by [\eqref=ou1]. For all [formula] we have

[formula]

Taking r = h(t) we get, using the conclusions of step 1, that for all [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

If [formula], then

[formula]

Step 3. For all [formula],

[formula]

With the argument used in the proof of [\cite=SSW], [\eqref=coup3] follows from [\eqref=proofcoup1] and [\eqref=proofcoup2].

Step 4. By assumption [\eqref=coup4],

[formula]

is finite on (0,  ∞  ); in particular, φ- 1∞(1)∈(0,  ∞  ]. On the other hand, for any [formula], according to [\eqref=coup1],

[formula]

Since the function t  ↦  φ- 1t(1) is decreasing on (0,  ∞  ], [\eqref=coup2] holds. This finishes the proof.

Appendix

Gradient Estimates for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes

Motivated by [\cite=SSW], we have the following results for gradient estimates of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This is the counterpart of Theorem [\ref=coup]. For t,ρ > 0, define

[formula]

where Φ is the characteristic exponent of the driving Lévy process [formula] from [\eqref=ou1].

Let Pt(x,  ·  ) be the transition function of the n-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [formula] given by [\eqref=ou1]. Assume that

[formula]

If for any C > 0,

[formula]

then there exists c > 0 such that for all t > 0 and [formula],

[formula]

If, in addition,

[formula]

then there exist t1,c > 0 such that for [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the norm of the matrix of M.

To illustrate the power of Theorem [\ref=strong], we consider

Let μ be a finite nonnegative measure on the unit sphere [formula] and assume that μ is nondegenerate in the sense that its support is not contained in any proper linear subspace of [formula]. Let α∈(0,2), β∈(0,  ∞  ] and assume that the Lévy measure ν satisfies

[formula]

for some constant r0 > 0 and all [formula]. Consider the following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process Xt on [formula] given by

[formula]

where [formula] is a Lévy process on [formula] with the Lévy measure ν. By Theorem [\ref=strong] there exists a constant c > 0 such that for all t > 0 and [formula],

[formula]

Furthermore, if the real parts of all eigenvalues of A are negative, then there exists a constant c > 0 such that for all t > 0 and [formula],

[formula]

Recently, F.-Y. Wang [\cite=W2] has presented explicit gradient estimates for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, by assuming that the corresponding Lévy measure has absolutely continuous (with respect to Lebesgue measure) lower bounds. Since lower bounds of Lévy measure in Example [\ref=examplegradient] could be much irregular, Theorem [\ref=strong] is more applicable than [\cite=W2].

Assuming the conditions [\eqref=strong1] and [\eqref=strong2], we can mimic the proof of [\cite=SSW] to show that there exist t1,C > 0 such that for all [formula] and [formula], Thus we can apply to find for all [formula] with [formula],

[formula]

Because of the Markov property of the semigroup Pt, the function

[formula]

is deceasing. Combining this and [\eqref=proofstrong] yields [\eqref=strong3].

The assertion [\eqref=strong4] follows if we combine the above argument with [\eqref=coup3]: there exist t2,C > 0 such that for all [formula] and [formula],

Proof of Proposition [\ref=improvement]

Because of [\eqref=wang22], we can choose a closed subset [formula] such that 0∉F and

[formula]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

Since F is a compact set and 0∉F, there exists some δ0 > 0 such that [formula] where [formula] Since ρ0 is locally integrable, we know that

[formula]

The remainder of the proof is now similar to the argument which shows that the shift [formula], [formula], is continuous, see e.g. [\cite=STR] or [\cite=RSCC]: choose [formula] such that [formula] and

[formula]

Therefore, for any [formula] with [formula], we obtain

[formula]

By the dominated convergence theorem we see that

[formula]

is continuous on [formula]. Therefore, there exists [formula] such that

[formula]

and, in particular,

[formula]

Using [formula] for all [formula], we get

[formula]

This finishes the proof.
