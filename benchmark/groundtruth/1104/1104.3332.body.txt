The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) quantization approach [\cite=batalin1] [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis] [\cite=gitman] is a reliable quantization scheme for theories with open gauge algebras like supergravity [\cite=freedman] [\cite=kallosh] [\cite=dewit]. In the lagrangian formalism, an open gauge algebra is characterized by a set of gauge structure tensors [\cite=dewit] [\cite=batalin1] [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis]. These tensors can be obtained from the BV field-antifield action [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis]. In several works [\cite=siegel] [\cite=henneaux1] [\cite=batlle1] [\cite=grigoryan] [\cite=razumov] [\cite=dejonghe] [\cite=batalin3] it has been shown that the BV field-antifield action is determined by the BRST extended Hamiltonian and the BRST charge. In order to determine the BRST charge, one requires knowledge of the hamiltonian gauge structure functions of all orders [\cite=henneaux]. Therefore, one may conclude that the lagrangian gauge structure tensors of higher orders must depend on the higher order hamiltonian gauge structure functions. In this paper we will show that this is not the case.

The purpose of the present paper is to prove that all the lagrangian gauge structure tensors are completely determined by the canonical Hamiltonian, the hamiltonian first-class constraints and the hamiltonian first-order gauge structure functions. In order to accomplish this, we will show that the generating functional of the lagrangian gauge structure tensors, the BV field-antifield action, can be written as a function of these hamiltonian quantities alone and does not depend on the hamiltonian gauge structure tensors of higher orders. We will also present an algorithm that will allow us to find all the lagrangian gauge structure tensors explicitly.

The BV field-antifield action S is a proper solution of the classical master equation [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis]:

[formula]

with the boundary conditions:

[formula]

[formula]

The bracket in ([\ref=3.2]) is the BV antibracket [\cite=batalin2].

The quantities Cμ(μ  =  1,2,...,m) are ghost fields. The variables q*i(i = 1,2,...,n) and C*μ(μ  =  1,2,...,m) are the antifields [\cite=batalin2].

The zeroth-order lagrangian gauge structure function S0 is the action functional of the physical theory:

[formula]

The lagrangian first-order gauge structure functions Riμ are the generators of the lagrangian gauge transformations.

The BV field-antifield action can be written in the following form:

[formula]

where [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis]:

[formula]

The tensors Tηαβ and Eijαβ are the second-order gauge structure functions of the gauge algebra in the lagrangian formalism. The generators of lagrangian gauge transformations Riμ are said to form an open gauge algebra if Eijαβ  ≠  0 [\cite=dewit] [\cite=batalin1] [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis]. If Eijαβ  =  0, the gauge algebra is said to be closed.

The existence of the higher order lagrangian gauge structure functions (Diραβγ,Mijkαβγ, etc) has been proven using an axiomatic approach in [\cite=batalin2]. These functions were constructed explicitly in [\cite=algebra].

The BV field-antifield action is the generating functional of the structure tensors of the gauge algebra in the lagrangian formalism [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis].

Let us consider a system with only primary first-class irreducible hamiltonian constraints Gμ(μ  =  1,2,...,m), such that [\cite=dirac] [\cite=fradkin]:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The function H0 is the canonical Hamiltonian. The tensors Cηαβ and Jησαβγ are the hamiltonian gauge structure functions of first- and second-order respectively.

Let FL* be the pullback application [\cite=batlle] [\cite=chaichian] from the momentum phase space into the velocity phase space defined by the relations:

[formula]

Notice that the generators of the lagrangian gauge transformations Riμ can be written in terms of the hamiltonian constraints as follows [\cite=dirac]:

[formula]

Let us consider the extended momentum phase space with points (qi,Pi,Cα,πα,q*j,p* j,C*β,π*  β), where Pi are the canonical momenta conjugate to qi:

[formula]

The canonical momentum variables πα, p*  j and π*  β are conjugate to the coordinates Cα, q*j and C*β respectively.

We define the pullback application FL* as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The functions FL*pi, FL*pkiα, FL*pδiαβ, FL*plkiαβ, FL*pkδiαβγ, FL*pklmiαβγ, etc are determined by the equations:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

We claim that the BV Lagrangian L can be written in terms of the canonical Hamiltonian H0, the hamiltonian first-class constraints Gμ and the hamiltonian first-order gauge structure funtions Cημν as follows:

[formula]

The hamiltonian H will be given by the expression:

[formula]

From ([\ref=3.10]) it follows that for any analytic function [formula] we can write:

[formula]

The Lagrange multipliers Λμ can also be written as:

[formula]

Let us consider the action:

[formula]

where L is given by the expression ([\ref=3.20]).

We will prove that the action S ([\ref=3.19],[\ref=3.20]) is a proper solution of the classical master equation ([\ref=3.2]) with the boundary conditions ([\ref=3.2a]) and ([\ref=3.2b]).

The antibracket in ([\ref=3.2]) can be written as [\cite=batalin2] [\cite=gomis]:

[formula]

From ([\ref=3.20]) and ([\ref=3.16]) we find that the first functional derivatives of the action S can be written in the following form:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

On the other hand, from ([\ref=3.15]) we find the following identities:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=3.14]) and ([\ref=3.27]-[\ref=3.31]) into ([\ref=3.22]-[\ref=3.25]) we finally obtain:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Therefore, we can write the BV antibracket of the action S with itself as follows:

[formula]

From ([\ref=3.36]), integrating by parts and using the relations ([\ref=3.14], [\ref=3.16]) we find that the BV antibracket of the functional S with itself can be written as:

[formula]

Using ([\ref=3.5], [\ref=3.6], [\ref=3.A]) and ([\ref=3.15]) in ([\ref=3.37]), it immediately follows that ([\ref=3.37]) reduces to:

[formula]

Assuming that Cα(ti)  =  Cα(tf)  =  0 we finally obtain:

[formula]

This proves that S in ([\ref=3.19], [\ref=3.20]) satisfies the BV classical master equation.

From ([\ref=3.20]) and ([\ref=3.9]) it immediately follows that:

[formula]

and therefore, S in ([\ref=3.19], [\ref=3.20]) satisfies the boundary condition ([\ref=3.2a]).

From ([\ref=3.33]) and ([\ref=3.34]) it follows that:

[formula]

Finally, from ([\ref=3.41]), ([\ref=3.18]) and ([\ref=3.7b]) we obtain:

[formula]

This proves that the action functional S also satisfies the boundary conditions ([\ref=3.2b]).

Therefore, we conclude that the Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifield action can be written in the form:

[formula]

As it can be seen from ([\ref=3.D]), the BV field-antifield action is completely determined by the canonical hamiltonian H0, the hamiltonian constraints Gμ and the hamiltonian first-order gauge structure functions Cημν. It does not depend on the hamiltonian second-order gauge structure functions Jησαβγ or other higher order hamiltonian gauge structure functions. Since the BV field-antifield action is the generating functional of all the lagrangian gauge structure tensors ([\ref=3.4]), we conclude that the lagrangian gauge structure tensors of all orders are completely determined by H0, Gμ and Cημν.

Notice that formula ([\ref=3.D]) is valid for the generic case of systems with open lagrangian gauge algebras. These systems may have nonvanishing lagrangian gauge structure tensors of higher orders.

From ([\ref=3.D]) using ([\ref=3.10]) and ([\ref=3.18]) and expanding ([\ref=3.14]) and ([\ref=3.15]) with the use of ([\ref=3.10]), ([\ref=3.18]) and ([\ref=3.16], [\ref=3.17]) we obtain the lagrangian gauge structure tensors up to fourth order in the form:

The functions FL*pijα and FL*pijkαβ are given by the expressions:

[formula]

[formula]

The above derivations illustrate how the lagrangian gauge structure tensors can be derived from the BV field-antifield action ([\ref=3.D]).
