Plasmons in Sodium under Pressure: Increasing Departure from Nearly-Free-Electron Behavior

Sodium, at ambient conditions, is one of the best manifestations of a "simple" or nearly-free-electron (NFE) metal [\cite=WS34]. It is characterized by a single s-type valence electron, weak interaction between the conduction electrons and the atomic cores (electron-ion interaction), and conduction band states of sp orbital character. Na crystallizes in the high-symmetry body-centered cubic (bcc) structure at pressures up to 65 GPa, where it transforms to face-centered cubic (fcc) [\cite=HLS02]. The properties of Na change fundamentally under pressure in the megabar pressure range, where a series of phase transitions into lower-symmetry crystal structures has been predicted [\cite=NA01+CN01] and observed [\cite=HSLC02] [\cite=GLMG08] [\cite=LGMG09], accompanied by marked changes in its optical properties [\cite=HSLC02] [\cite=LGMG09] [\cite=LGSC09] and culminating in the formation of a non-metallic, visually transparent phase at ~  200 GPa [\cite=MEOX09]. A central question is how the transformation from a simple metal to a semiconductor progresses, not only in Na, but also in other metals such as Li, which was reported to become semiconducting above 70 GPa [\cite=MS09]. As for Na, does it remain NFE-like in its bcc and fcc phases up to ~  100 GPa [\cite=LGSC09] so that the non-NFE behavior starts only with the transitions into the lower-symmetry phases above 105 GPa, or are there significant precursors at lower pressure?

To provide an answer, we measured and calculated the pressure dependence of Na plasmon energies. Plasmon excitations provide information on the collective electronic excitations in the form of longitudinal charge density waves at finite wavevector, and they determine the optical response of a metal, specifically the plasma reflection edge. Plasmons have been studied for many years by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) at zero pressure (see for example [\cite=FSF89] [\cite=SFF89] and references therein), but this technique is not suitable for samples enclosed in high-pressure cells. Mao et al. [\cite=MKH01] have demonstrated the possibility of measuring plasmon excitations in Na under pressure using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), and they found their experimental results up to 2.7 GPa to be in agreement with theoretical predictions.

We report here detailed IXS results on the plasmon energy dispersion in Na under pressure up to 43 GPa, corresponding to a 2.6-fold increase in density. Our results evidence a significant departure from the predictions for a NFE metal. In order to explain this discrepancy between theory and experiment, we also present plasmon energy calculations based on first-principles electronic band structures and a quasi-classical plasmon model after Paasch and Grigoryan (PG model) [\cite=PG99]. These calculations reconcile experiment and theory and allow us to identify changes in the electron-ion interaction as the dominant effect, rather than changes in the electron-electron interactions. Some experimental results are also reported for K and Rb.

The theoretical description of plasmons in simple metals is well established. The most commonly used approach starts from the free-electron (FE) gas and uses the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [\cite=Pin64]. The plasmon energy dispersion Ep(q) is then given by [formula] with the plasma frequency [formula] and the dispersion coefficient [formula], where q is the plasmon momentum, m the electron mass, n the electron density, εs a dielectric constant describing the polarizability of the ionic cores (εs  =  1 for the free-electron gas), and EF  =  (2 / 2m)(3π2n)2 / 3 is the Fermi energy. This relatively simple model works reasonably well for simple metals such as Na and Al at ambient conditions [\cite=FSF89] [\cite=SFF89], but experimental dispersion coefficients α tend to be lower than the theoretical values, which has been attributed to electron exchange and correlation effects [\cite=SFF89]. Both the plasma frequency ωp and the dispersion coefficient α depend on the electron density and can thus be tuned by the application of pressure; both are expected to increase with increasing pressure. The stability of bcc sodium over a large pressure range of 0-65 GPa permits to generate an up to threefold increase in (electron) density without a structural transition.

IXS experiments were performed on beamline ID16 at the ESRF, Grenoble. Silicon crystal monochromators were used to monochromatize the incident beam and to analyze the scattered radiation. The incident x-ray beam with a photon energy of 9.877 keV was focussed onto the polycrystalline sample in a high-pressure cell with a spot diameter of 100-200 m, depending on the sample size. IXS spectra of the samples at room temperature were recorded in energy-scanning mode with an overall spectral resolution of 0.6 eV and a momentum resolution of 0.4 nm- 1. In most of the experiments, the samples were pressurized in diamond anvil cells (DACs). Rhenium and stainless steel gaskets were used with initial thicknesses of 50-100 m and hole diameters of 150-200 m. The loading of distilled Na, K, and Rb into the pressure cells was carried out in an argon atmosphere. Because of the softness of these metals no pressure transmitting medium was added. Pressures were determined with the ruby method [\cite=ruby:method] or by measuring an x-ray powder diffraction of the sample and using its known equation of state [\cite=HLS02]. In the experiments using a DAC, the incoming x-ray beam passed through one diamond anvil onto the sample, and the scattered radiation was collected through the opposing anvil (thickness ~  1.5 mm). Despite the small sample scattering volume and the relatively low diamond transmittance of 30% for 10-keV x-rays, high-quality spectra could be collected in ~  2 hours. The experiments on Na at 1 and 7 GPa were performed using a high-pressure cell equipped with sintered-diamond anvils and a beryllium gasket. Here, the x-rays passed through the Be gasket.

Figure [\ref=fig:spectra] shows IXS spectra of polycrystalline Na under pressure. A single excitation peak is observed, which is attributed to the bulk plasmon in Na, based on the predictions for a NFE metal with the electron density of Na and also by comparison with previous EELS results [\cite=FSF89]. The rising background in the spectra of Fig. [\ref=fig:spectra], in particular at large q, is due to plasmon and interband excitations in the diamond anvil through which the scattered radiation is detected [\cite=WKAF00].

Plasmon energies and linewidths were determined by fitting the spectra with a Gaussian peak for the plasmon line and a polynomial background. As all experiments were performed on polycrystalline samples, the reported plasmon energies are directional averages. The Na plasmon energies increase with increasing pressure as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=fig:NaKRb_energies] for q  =  5 nm- 1. This is in qualitative agreement with the NFE picture, where the plasmon energies scale with the electron density.

Figure [\ref=fig:NaKRb_energies] also shows results for K and Rb. These two metals clearly do not follow the expectations for NFE metals. Moreover, their plasmon linewidths increased and their plasmon intensities decreased rapidly with increasing pressure. These effects are attributed to the pressure-driven s-d hybridization of conduction band states, as is also evident from the optical response of K and Rb under pressure [\cite=TTS82] [\cite=TS83] (see also [\cite=KE99]). We will therefore focus on Na that could be studied over the largest pressure range and which, at ambient conditions, is one of the best manifestations of a nearly-free-electron metal.

Figure [\ref=fig:Na_disp_width](a) shows the measured plasmon dispersion relations of Na at several pressures. The plasmon energies are plotted versus q2 because of the anticipated parabolic dispersion relation, see the Ep(q) relation given above. At the lowest pressure, 1 GPa, the Na plasmon dispersion measured here is indeed very close to parabolic. Results of an ambient-pressure EELS study [\cite=FSF89] are included in Fig. [\ref=fig:Na_disp_width](a) for comparison. In the low-q region, the IXS and EELS data are reasonably consistent, but the EELS results exhibit some deviation from a parabolic dispersion. The offset, at low q, between the IXS and EELS data is largely due to the pressure applied in the IXS experiment. The 1-GPa plasmon dispersion measured by IXS is described best by E(0)  =  ωp  =  5.82(2) eV and α  =  0.26(1). As noted before [\cite=FSF89], the experimental dispersion parameter α is lower than the FE/RPA value of [formula]. Towards higher pressures, the measured plasmon dispersion remains approximately parabolic, deviations being most notable at 16 GPa.

Figure [\ref=fig:Na_disp_width](b) shows that also the plasmon linewidth is strongly pressure dependent. This effect is tentatively attributed to a reduction of the plasmon lifetime due to decays involving electron-hole excitations. A detailed study by, e.g., time-dependent density functional theory could be a subject for future studies. For the remainder of this paper we focus on the plasmon energies, assuming that self-energy effects on the plasmon frequency can be neglected.

The IXS results on the plasmon energies of Na as a function of momentum and pressure allow us to test the validity of the FE/RPA description of Na and to assess the relative importance of band structure effects, core polarizability, and exchange-correlation. Using Ep(q) as given above and the experimental equation of state of Na [\cite=HLS02], the pressure dependence of the q = 5 nm- 1 plasmon was calculated within the FE/RPA framework as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:Na5nm_p-dep]. This FE/RPA estimate is significantly higher in energy than the experimental values, and the deviation increases with increasing pressure. Inclusion of the core polarization (εs  =  1.16, Ref. [\cite=NP82]) leads to a good agreement with the experiment at low pressure, but a major deviation between theory and experiment remains at high pressure.

The important observation here is the striking increase in the deviation between theory and experiment with increasing pressure. In previous work on other metals, deviations from the FE/RPA predictions were discussed in relation to exchange and correlation effects [\cite=FSF89] [\cite=SGBB91], and a number of extensions of the RPA were proposed in this spirit (see [\cite=SGBB91] [\cite=FSF89] [\cite=VS72] and references therein). Their main effect is to reduce the plasmon dispersion coefficient α, and their inclusion can improve the agreement between theory and experiment. However, exchange-correlation effects decrease with increasing electron density, and they can thus be excluded as the origin of the deviation between the 'FE/RPA + core polarization' results and the experimental data in Fig. [\ref=fig:Na5nm_p-dep]. More recent theoretical studies have emphasized the importance of band-structure effects on the plasmon properties, regarding both the energy dispersion [\cite=PG99] and the plasmon linewidth [\cite=KE99]. The present IXS results offer an opportunity to test these proposals.

The PG plasmon model [\cite=PG99] adopted here is an extension of the FE/RPA approach. This classical model is not expected to describe the plasmon properties as accurately as, e.g., time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) [\cite=KE99], but it allows us better to understand the underlying physics. The electronic structure of the metal is described here by a single isotropic conduction band with a quartic dispersion, E(k)  =  E2k2  +  E4k4. The E4k4 term accounts for deviations from the parabolic band shape of the free-electron gas. The plasma frequency ωp and the plasmon dispersion coefficient α can then be determined from E2, E4 and the Fermi energy EF as described in detail in [\cite=PG99].

Electronic structure calculations of Na were performed in the framework of first-principles DFT, using the full-potential L/APW+lo method [\cite=SNS00] [\cite=MBSS01] and the Generalized Gradient Approximation [\cite=PBE96] as implemented in the WIEN2K code [\cite=soft:Wien2k]. The electronic band structure of bcc Na was calculated for a series of volumes corresponding to the pressure range of 0-50 GPa [\cite=misc:CompDetails]. The coefficients E2 and E4 were determined for three directions in the Brillouin zone, i.e. along
