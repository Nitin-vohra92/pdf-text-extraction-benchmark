Introduction

In [\cite=Zhidd] A. Zhedanov introduced the Askey-Wilson algebra AW  =  AW(3) and used it to describe the Askey-Wilson polynomials [\cite=Askey]. Since then, AW has become one of the main objects in the theory of the Askey scheme of orthogonal polynomials [\cite=GYLZmut] [\cite=GYZlinear] [\cite=GH1] [\cite=KoeSwa] [\cite=Koo1] [\cite=Koo2] [\cite=VZ2] [\cite=VZ3]. It is particularly useful in the theory of Leonard pairs [\cite=NT:span] [\cite=LS99] [\cite=madrid] [\cite=aw] [\cite=vidunas] [\cite=V2] and Leonard triples [\cite=Curt2] [\cite=Curt1] [\cite=koro]. The algebra AW is related to the algebra [formula] [\cite=GYZnature] [\cite=GYZlinear] [\cite=Rosengren] [\cite=rosengren] [\cite=wieg] and the algebra [formula] [\cite=atak1] [\cite=atak2] [\cite=atak3]. There is a connection to the double affine Hecke algebra of type [formula] [\cite=dahater] [\cite=Koo1] [\cite=Koo2]. The [formula]-symmetric quantum algebra O'q(so3) [\cite=ciccoli], [\cite=fairlie], [\cite=su2], [\cite=posta] [\cite=posta2] [\cite=jordan] [\cite=odesskii] is a special case of AW, and the recently introduced Calabi-Yau algebras [\cite=calabi] give a generalization of AW. The algebra AW plays a role in integrable systems [\cite=aneva] [\cite=bas2] [\cite=bas1] [\cite=bas3] [\cite=bas4] [\cite=bas5] [\cite=bas6] [\cite=bas7] [\cite=bas8] [\cite=basnc] [\cite=lav1] [\cite=lav2] [\cite=lav3] [\cite=VZ] and quantum mechanics [\cite=odake2] [\cite=odake], as well as the theory of quadratic algebras [\cite=jordan] [\cite=kalnins] [\cite=ros]. There is a classical version of AW that has a Poisson algebra structure [\cite=GYLZmut], [\cite=koro], [\cite=oblomkov], [\cite=LPcm].

In this paper we introduce a central extension of AW called the universal Askey-Wilson algebra. This central extension, which we denote by Δ, is related to AW in the following way. There is a reduced [formula]-symmetric presentation of AW that involves three scalar parameters besides q [\cite=koro]. Up to normalization, the algebra Δ is what one gets from this presentation by reinterpreting the three scalar parameters as central elements in the algebra. By construction Δ has no scalar parameters besides q, and there exists a surjective algebra homomorphism Δ  →  AW. One advantage of Δ over AW is that Δ has a larger automorphism group. Our definition of Δ was inspired by [\cite=dahater], which in turn was motivated by [\cite=ion].

Let us now bring in more detail, and recall the definition of AW. There are at least three presentations in the literature; the original one involving three generators [\cite=Zhidd], one involving two generators [\cite=Koo1], [\cite=aw], and a [formula]-symmetric presentation involving three generators [\cite=koro], [\cite=ros], [\cite=smithandbell], [\cite=wieg]. We will use the presentation in [\cite=koro], although we adjust the normalization and replace q by q2 in order to illuminate the underlying symmetry.

Our conventions for the paper are as follows. An algebra is meant to be associative and have a 1. A subalgebra has the same 1 as the parent algebra. We fix a field [formula] and a nonzero [formula] such that [formula].

Let a, b, c denote scalars in [formula]. Define the [formula]-algebra AW  =  AWq(a,b,c) by generators and relations in the following way. The generators are A, B, C. The relations assert that are equal to a / (q + q- 1), b / (q + q- 1), c / (q + q- 1) respectively. We call AW the Askey-Wilson algebra that corresponds to a, b, c.

We now introduce the algebra Δ.

Define an [formula]-algebra Δ  =  Δq by generators and relations in the following way. The generators are A, B, C. The relations assert that each of is central in Δ. We call Δ the universal Askey-Wilson algebra.

For the three central elements in ([\ref=eq:comlist]), multiply each by q + q- 1 to get α, β, γ. Thus Note that each of α, β, γ is central in Δ. (The purpose of the factor q + q- 1 is to make the upcoming formula ([\ref=eq:caspreview]) more attractive.)

From the construction we obtain the following result.

Let a, b, c denote scalars in [formula] and let AW denote the corresponding Askey-Wilson algebra. Then there exists a surjective [formula]-algebra homomorphism Δ  →  AW that sends

In this paper we begin a comprehensive study of the algebra Δ. For now we consider the ring-theoretic aspects, and leave the representation theory for some future paper. Our main results are summarized as follows. We give an alternate presentation for Δ by generators and relations; the generators are A, B, γ. Following [\cite=Curt2], [\cite=dahater], [\cite=koro], [\cite=oblomkov] we give a faithful action of the modular group [formula] on Δ as a group of automorphisms; one generator sends (A,B,C)  ↦  (B,C,A) and another generator sends (A,B,γ)  ↦  (B,A,γ). Following [\cite=posta2], [\cite=jordan] we show that is a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δ. Following [\cite=posta2], [\cite=koro], [\cite=Zhidd] we show that the center Z(Δ) contains a Casimir element Under the assumption that q is not a root of unity, we show that Z(Δ) is generated by Ω, α, β, γ and that Z(Δ) is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra in 4 variables. Using the alternate presentation we relate Δ to the q-Onsager algebra [\cite=basnc], [\cite=IT:aug], [\cite=qSerre]. We describe the 2-sided ideal Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ from several points of view. Our main result here is that [formula] is equal to the intersection of (i) the subalgebra of Δ generated by A, B; (ii) the subalgebra of Δ generated by B, C; (iii) the subalgebra of Δ generated by C, A. At the end of the paper we list some open problems that are intended to motivate further research.

Another presentation of [formula]

A bit later in the paper we will discuss automorphisms of Δ. To facilitate this discussion we give another presentation for Δ by generators and relations.

The [formula]-algebra Δ is generated by A, B, γ. Moreover

Line ([\ref=eq:getc]) is from ([\ref=eq:u3]). To get ([\ref=eq:getalpha]), ([\ref=eq:getbeta]) eliminate C in ([\ref=eq:u1]), ([\ref=eq:u2]) using ([\ref=eq:getc]).

Recall the notation

The [formula]-algebra Δ has a presentation by generators A, B, γ and relations

Use Lemma [\ref=lem:abgpres] to express the defining relations for Δ in terms of A, B, γ.

The first two equations in Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres] are known as the tridiagonal relations [\cite=qSerre]. These relations have appeared in algebraic combinatorics [\cite=tersub3], the theory of tridiagonal pairs [\cite=TD00] [\cite=IT:qRacah] [\cite=LS99] [\cite=qSerre] [\cite=madrid], and integrable systems [\cite=bas2] [\cite=bas1] [\cite=bas3] [\cite=bas4] [\cite=bas5] [\cite=bas6] [\cite=bas7] [\cite=bas8] [\cite=basnc].

An action of [formula] on [formula]

We now consider some automorphisms of Δ. Recall that the modular group [formula] has a presentation by generators ρ, σ and relations ρ3 = 1, σ2 = 1. See for example [\cite=alpern].

The group [formula] acts on Δ as a group of automorphisms in the following way:

[formula]

By Definition [\ref=def:uaw] there exists an automorphism P of Δ that sends Observe P3 = 1. By ([\ref=eq:u1])-([\ref=eq:u3]) the map P sends By Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres] there exists an automorphism S of Δ that sends Observe S2 = 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem:abgpres] the map S sends The result follows.

In Theorem [\ref=thm:try] we gave an action of [formula] on Δ. Our next goal is to show that this action is faithful.

Let λ denote an indeterminate. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the Laurent polynomials in λ that have all coefficients in [formula]. We will be discussing the [formula]-algebra We view elements of Λ as 2  ×  2 matrices that have entries in [formula]. From this point of view the product operation for Λ is ordinary matrix multiplication, and the multiplicative identity in Λ is the identity matrix I. For notational convenience define μ  =  λ  +  λ- 1.

For later use we now describe the center Z(Λ).

For all η∈Λ the following (i), (ii) are equivalent:

η∈Z(Λ).

There exists [formula] such that η  =  θI.

Routine.

Let A, B, C denote the following elements of Λ:

We have

Use Definition [\ref=def:xyz].

In the algebra Λ the elements A, B, C multiply as follows:

[formula]

Use Lemma [\ref=lem:xyz].

The algebra Λ is not generated by A, B, C. However we do have the following result.

Suppose η∈Λ commutes with at least two of A, B, C. Then η∈Z(Λ).

For 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  2 let ηij denote the (i,j)-entry of η. The matrix η commutes with each of A, B, C since ABC = I. In the equation ηA  =  Aη, evaluate A using Definition [\ref=def:xyz], and simplify the result to get η21 = 0. Similarly using ηB  =  Bη we find η12 = 0 and η11  =  η22. Therefore η  =  η11I∈Z(Λ).

Next we describe an action of [formula] on Λ as a group of automorphisms.

Let p and s denote the following elements of Λ:

The following (i)-(iv) hold.

det (p) = 1 and det (s) =  - λ.

p3 =  - I and s2  =  λI.

pAp- 1  =  B, pBp- 1  =  C, pCp- 1  =  A.

sAs- 1  =  B and sBs- 1  =  A.

(i), (ii) Use Definition [\ref=def:ps]. (iii), (iv) Use Definition [\ref=def:xyz] and Definition [\ref=def:ps].

The group [formula] acts on Λ as a group of automorphisms such that ρ(η) = pηp- 1 and σ(η)  =  sηs- 1 for all η∈Λ.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:4](ii) the elements p3, s2 are in Z(Λ).

The action of [formula] on Λ is faithful.

Pick an integer n  ≥  1. Consider an element η∈Λ of the form [formula] such that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, ηi = s for one parity of i and ηi∈{p,p- 1} for the other parity of i. We show that [formula]. To this end we assume η∈Z(Λ) and get a contradiction. Let [formula] denote the number of times s occurs among {ηi}ni = 1. Assume for the moment [formula]. Then n = 1 so η  =  η1∈{p,p- 1}. The elements p, p- 1 are not in Z(Λ), for a contradiction. Therefore [formula]. From the nature of the matrices p, s in Definition [\ref=def:ps], we may view η as a polynomial in λ that has coefficients in [formula] and degree at most [formula]. Call this polynomial f. We claim that the degree of f is exactly [formula]. To prove the claim, write Let [formula] denote the coefficient of [formula] in f. The matrix m is obtained from [formula] by replacing each occurrence of s by s1. Using s1ps1 =  - s1 and s1p- 1s1 = s1 we find m∈{  ±  pis1pj| - 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  1}. The matrix p is invertible and [formula] so [formula] for - 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  1. Therefore [formula] and the claim is proved. Let κ denote the (1,1)-entry of the matrix η. Then η  =  κI since η∈Z(Λ). In the equation [formula] take the determinant of each side and use Lemma [\ref=lem:4](i) to get [formula]. Therefore [formula] is even and [formula]. Now [formula], so the above polynomial f has degree [formula]. But [formula] so [formula] for a contradiction. the result follows.

We now display an algebra homomorphism Δ  →  Λ.

There exists a unique [formula]-algebra homomorphism π:Δ  →  Λ that sends The homomorphism π sends where ν  =  (q2 + q- 2)μ  +  μ2.

Define By Lemma [\ref=lem:xyz] and Lemma [\ref=lem:multtable2], By ([\ref=eq:vee1])-([\ref=eq:vee3]) and since νI is central, the elements [formula], [formula], [formula] satisfy the defining relations for Δ from Definition [\ref=def:uaw]. Therefore the homomorphism π exists. The homomorphism π is unique since A, B, C generate Δ. Line ([\ref=eq:pisend]) follows from Definition [\ref=def:abc] and ([\ref=eq:vee1])-([\ref=eq:vee3]).

For [formula] the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

The elements ρ, σ form a generating set for [formula]; without loss we may assume that g is contained in this set. By Theorem [\ref=thm:try] the action of ρ on Δ cyclically permutes A, B, C. By Lemma [\ref=lem:4](iii) the action of ρ on Λ cyclically permutes A, B, C. By Theorem [\ref=thm:try] the action of σ on Δ swaps A, B and fixes γ. By Lemma [\ref=lem:4](iv) and the construction, the action of σ on Λ swaps A, B and fixes I. The diagram commutes by these comments and Lemma [\ref=prop:uhomoh].

The action of [formula] on Δ is faithful.

Let g denote an element of [formula] that fixes everything in Δ. We show that g = 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem:conj] and since ρ, σ generate [formula], there exists an invertible ξ∈Λ such that g(η) = ξηξ- 1 for all η∈Λ. By assumption g fixes the element A of Δ. Under the homomomorphim π:Δ  →  Λ the image of A is qA + q- 1A- 1, so g fixes qA + q- 1A- 1 in view of Lemma [\ref=lem:comdiagf]. Therefore ξ commutes with qA + q- 1A- 1. Recall A  +  A- 1  =  μI by Lemma [\ref=lem:xyz], so ξ commutes with A  +  A- 1. By these comments and [formula] we find ξ commutes with A. By a similar argument ξ commutes with B. Now ξ∈Z(Λ) by Lemma [\ref=lem:whatittakes]. Consequently g fixes everything in Λ, so g = 1 by Lemma [\ref=lem:faith1].

A basis for [formula]

In this section we display a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δ.

The following is a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δ.

We invoke Bergman's Diamond Lemma [\cite=berg]. Consider the symbols For an integer n  ≥  0, by a Δ-word of length n we mean a sequence [formula] such that xi is listed in ([\ref=eq:letters]) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. We interpret the Δ-word of length zero to be the multiplicative identity in Δ. Consider a Δ-word [formula]. By an inversion for w we mean an ordered pair of integers (i,j) such that 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  n and xi is strictly to the right of xj in the list ([\ref=eq:letters]). For example CABA has 4 inversions and CB2A has 5 inversions. A Δ-word is called reducible whenever it has at least one inversion, and irreducible otherwise. The list ([\ref=eq:basis]) consists of the irreducible Δ-words. For each integer n  ≥  0 let Wn denote the set of Δ-words that have length n. Let [formula] denote the set of all Δ-words. We now define a partial order <   on W. The definition has two aspects. (i) For all integers n > m  ≥  0, every word in Wm is less than every word in Wn, with respect to <  . (ii) For an integer n  ≥  0 the restriction of <   to Wn is described as follows. Pick w,w'∈Wn and write [formula]. We say that w covers w' whenever there exists an integer j (2  ≤  j  ≤  n) such that (j - 1,j) is an inversion for w, and w' is obtained from w by interchanging xj - 1,xj. In this case w' has one fewer inversions than w. Therefore the transitive closure of the covering relation on Wn is a partial order on Wn, and this is the restriction of <   to Wn. We have now defined a partial order <   on W. By construction this partial order is a semi-group partial order [\cite=berg] and satisfies the descending chain condition [\cite=berg]. By Definition [\ref=def:uaw] and Definition [\ref=def:abc] the defining relations for Δ can be expressed as follows: The above equations give reduction rules for Δ-words, as we now explain. Let [formula] denote a reducible Δ-word. Then there exists an integer j (2  ≤  j  ≤  n) such that (j - 1,j) is an inversion for w. In the above list of equations, there exists an equation with xj - 1xj on the left-hand side; in w we eliminate xj - 1xj using this equation and thereby express w as a linear combination of Δ-words, each less than w with respect to <  . Therefore the reduction rules are compatible with <   in the sense of Bergman [\cite=berg]. In order to employ the Diamond Lemma, we must show that the ambiguities are resolvable in the sense of Bergman [\cite=berg]. There are potentially two kinds of ambiguities; inclusion ambiguities and overlap ambiguities [\cite=berg]. For the present example there are no inclusion ambiguities. The only nontrivial overlap ambiguity involves the word CBA. This word can be reduced in two ways; we could evaluate CB first or we could evaluate BA first. Either way, after a three-step reduction we obtain the same result, which is Therefore the overlap ambiguity CBA is resolvable. We conclude that every ambiguity is resolvable, so by the Diamond Lemma [\cite=berg] the elements ([\ref=eq:basis]) form a basis for Δ.

On occasion we wish to discuss the coefficients when an element of Δ is written as a linear combination of the elements ([\ref=eq:basis]). To facilitate this discussion we define a bilinear form [formula] such that (u,v)  =  δu,v for all elements u, v in the basis ([\ref=eq:basis]). In other words the basis ([\ref=eq:basis]) is orthonormal with respect to (  ,). Observe that (  ,) is symmetric. For u∈Δ, where the sum is over all elements AiBjCkαrβsγt in the basis ([\ref=eq:basis]).

Let u∈Δ. A given element AiBjCkαrβsγt in the basis ([\ref=eq:basis]) is said to contribute to u whenever [formula].

A filtration of [formula]

In this section we obtain a filtration of Δ which is related to the basis from Theorem [\ref=thm:basis]. This filtration will be useful when we investigate the center Z(Δ) later in the paper.

We recall some notation. For subspaces H, K of Δ define HK = Span{hk|h∈H,  k∈K}.

We define subspaces {Δn}∞n = 0 of Δ such that

The following (i)-(iii) hold.

Δn - 1  ⊆  Δn for n  ≥  1.

[formula].

ΔmΔn  =  Δm + n for m,n  ≥  0.

(i) Since Δn  =  Δ1Δn - 1 and 1∈Δ1. (ii) Since A, B, C, α, β, γ generate Δ. (iii) Each side is equal to (Δ1)m + n.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:filt] the sequence {Δn}∞n = 0 is a filtration of Δ in the sense of [\cite=carter].

Each of the following is contained in Δ1:

Each of the three expressions is a linear combination of A, B, C, α, β, γ and these are contained in Δ1.

For all integers n  ≥  0 the following is a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δn:

The elements ([\ref=eq:basislist]) are linearly independent by Theorem [\ref=thm:basis]. We show that the elements ([\ref=eq:basislist]) span Δn. We will use induction on n. Assume n  ≥  2; otherwise the result holds by Definition [\ref=def:ui]. By Definition [\ref=def:ui] Δn is spanned by the set of elements of the form [formula] where xi∈{1,A,B,C,α,β,γ} for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Therefore Δn is spanned by the set of elements of the form [formula] where 0  ≤  m  ≤  n and xi∈{A,B,C,α,β,γ} for 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Therefore Δn is spanned by Δn - 1 together with the set of elements of the form [formula] where xi∈{A,B,C,α,β,γ} for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Consider such an element [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:almostcom] and since each of α, β, γ is central, we find that for 2  ≤  j  ≤  n, By the above comments Δn is spanned by Δn - 1 together with the set By this and induction Δn is spanned by the elements ([\ref=eq:basislist]). We have shown that the elements ([\ref=eq:basislist]) form a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δn.

Let V denote a vector space over [formula] and let U denote a subspace of V. By a complement of U in V we mean a subspace U' of V such that V = U + U' (direct sum).

For all integers n  ≥  1 the following is a basis for a complement of Δn - 1 in Δn:

Use Theorem [\ref=lem:unbasis].

The Casimir element [formula]

We turn our attention to the center Z(Δ). In this section we discuss a certain element Ω∈Z(Δ) called the Casimir element. The name is motivated by [\cite=Zhidd]. In Section 7 we will use Ω to describe Z(Δ). We acknowledge that the results of this section are extensions of [\cite=posta2], [\cite=koro], [\cite=Zhidd].

The following elements of Δ coincide: We denote this common element by Ω.

Denote the displayed sequence of elements by Ω+B, Ω+C, Ω+A, Ω-B, Ω-C, Ω-A. The automorphism ρ cyclically permutes Ω+A, Ω+B, Ω+C and cyclically permutes Ω-A, Ω-B, Ω-C. The element Ω+B  -  Ω-C is equal to (q - q- 1)A times The element ([\ref=eq:need0]) is zero by Definition [\ref=def:abc] so Ω+B  =  Ω-C. In this equation we apply ρ twice to get Ω+C  =  Ω-A and Ω+A  =  Ω-B. The element Ω+B  -  Ω-A is equal to times (q - q- 1)C. The element ([\ref=eq:need02]) is zero by Definition [\ref=def:abc] so Ω+B  =  Ω-A. Applying ρ twice we get Ω+C  =  Ω-B and Ω+A  =  Ω-C. By these comments Ω+B, Ω+C, Ω+A, Ω-B, Ω-C, Ω-A coincide.

The element Ω from Lemma  [\ref=lem:six] is central in Δ.

We first show ΩA  =  AΩ. We will work with the equations ([\ref=eq:u2]), ([\ref=eq:u3]) from Definition [\ref=def:abc]. Consider the equation which is qC times ([\ref=eq:u2]) plus ([\ref=eq:u2]) times q- 1C minus γ times ([\ref=eq:u2]) plus β times ([\ref=eq:u3]) minus q- 1B times ([\ref=eq:u3]) minus ([\ref=eq:u3]) times qB. After some cancellation this equation yields Ω+BA - AΩ+C = 0, where Ω+B, Ω+C are from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:six]. Therefore ΩA = AΩ. One similarly finds ΩB  =  BΩ and ΩC  =  CΩ. The elements A, B, C generate Δ so Ω is central in Δ.

We call Ω the Casimir element of Δ.

The Casimir element Ω is fixed by everything in [formula].

Since ρ, σ generate [formula] it suffices to show that each of ρ, σ fixes Ω. We use the notation Ω+A, Ω+B from the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:six]. Observe that ρ fixes Ω since ρ(Ω+A) = Ω+B. To verify that σ fixes Ω we show that σ(Ω+B) = Ω+A. For notational convenience define By Theorem [\ref=thm:try] and the definition Ω+B, By this and the definition of Ω+A, In the above equation each parenthetical expression is zero so σ(Ω+B) = Ω+A. Therefore σ fixes Ω.

A basis for [formula] that involves [formula]

In Theorem [\ref=thm:basis] we displayed a basis for Δ. In this section we display a related basis for Δ that involves the Casimir element Ω. In the next section we will use the related basis to describe the center Z(Δ).

Recall the filtration {Δn}∞n = 0 of Δ from Definition [\ref=def:ui].

For all integers [formula] the following hold:

[formula].

[formula].

Consider the expression for Ω from the first displayed line of Lemma [\ref=lem:six]. The term qABC is in Δ3 and the remaining terms are in Δ2. Therefore Ω∈Δ3 and Ω - qABC∈Δ2. By this and Lemma [\ref=lem:filt](iii) we find [formula] and [formula]. Using Lemma [\ref=lem:almostcom] we obtain [formula]. By these comments [formula].

For all integers n  ≥  1 the following is a basis for a complement of Δn - 1 in Δn:

Let [formula] denote the set consisting of the 6-tuples (i,j,k,r,s,t) of nonnegative integers whose sum is n. By Corollary [\ref=lem:com] the following is a basis for a complement of Δn - 1 in Δn: Let [formula] denote the set consisting of the 7-tuples [formula] of nonnegative integers such that ijk = 0 and [formula]. Observe that the map is a bijection. Suppose we are given [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:omegapower], Δn - 1 contains By Lemma [\ref=lem:almostcom], Δn - 1 contains Therefore Δn - 1 contains By these comments the following is a basis for a complement of Δn - 1 in Δn: The result follows.

Pick an integer n  ≥  1. In Corollary [\ref=lem:com] and Lemma [\ref=lem:basis2c] we mentioned a complement of Δn - 1 in Δn. These complements are not the same in general.

For all integers n  ≥  0 the following is a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δn:

By Lemma [\ref=lem:basis2c] and [formula].

The following is a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δ:

Combine Lemma [\ref=lem:filt](ii) and Proposition [\ref=lem:basis2n].

The center [formula]

In this section we give a detailed description of the center Z(Δ), under the assumption that q is not a root of unity. For such q we show that Z(Δ) is generated by Ω, α, β, γ and isomorphic to a polynomial algebra in four variables.

Recall the commutator [r,s] = rs - sr.

Let i, j, k denote nonnegative integers. Then Δi + j + k contains each of the following:

Concerning ([\ref=eq:1]), observe By Lemma [\ref=lem:almostcom] Δi + j + k contains By these comments Δi + j + k contains ([\ref=eq:1]). One similarly finds that Δi + j + k contains ([\ref=eq:2]), ([\ref=eq:3]).

Assume that q is not a root of unity. Then the following is a basis for the [formula]-vector space Z(Δ).

Abbreviate Z = Z(Δ). The elements ([\ref=eq:cbasis]) are linearly independent by Theorem [\ref=lem:basis2], so it suffices to show that they span Z. Let Z' denote the subspace of Δ spanned by ([\ref=eq:cbasis]), and note that Z'  ⊆  Z. To show Z' = Z, we assume that Z' is properly contained in Z and get a contradiction. Define the set [formula] and note [formula]. We have [formula] so [formula]. By this and Lemma [\ref=lem:filt](i),(ii) there exists a unique integer n  ≥  1 such that [formula] and [formula]. Fix [formula]. Let S = S(u) denote the set of 6-tuples (i,j,k,r,s,t) of nonnegative integers whose sum is n and AiBjCkαrβsγt contributes to u in the sense of Definition [\ref=def:contrib]. By ([\ref=eq:bilsum]) and Corollary [\ref=lem:com], Δn - 1 contains We are going to show that i = j = k for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. To this end we first claim that j = k for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. To prove the claim, take the commutator of A with ([\ref=eq:dif]) and evaluate the result using the following facts. By construction u∈E  ⊆  Z so [A,u] = 0. By Lemma [\ref=lem:filt](iii) AΔn - 1  ⊆  Δn and Δn - 1A  ⊆  Δn so [A,Δn - 1]  ⊆  Δn. Moreover each of α, β, γ is central. The above evaluation shows that Δn contains Pick (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. By Lemma [\ref=lem:filt](iii) and Lemma [\ref=lem:ijk], Δn contains By the above comments Δn contains For all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S the element Ai + 1BjCkαrβsγt is contained in the basis for the complement of Δn in Δn + 1 given in Corollary [\ref=lem:com]. Therefore By the definition of S we have [formula] for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. Therefore 1 - q2j - 2k  =  0 for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. The scalar q is not a root of unity so j = k for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. The claim is proved. We next claim that i = j for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. This claim is proved like the previous one, except that as we begin the argument below ([\ref=eq:dif]), we use C instead of A in the commutator. By the two claims i = j = k for all (i,j,k,r,s,t)∈S. In light of this we revisit the assertion above ([\ref=eq:dif]) and conclude that Δn - 1 contains Pick (i,i,i,r,s,t)∈S. By Lemma [\ref=lem:filt](iii) and Lemma [\ref=lem:omegapower], Δn - 1 contains By these comments Δn - 1 contains In the above expression let ψ denote the main sum, so that u - ψ∈Δn - 1. Observe ψ∈Z'  ⊆  Z. Recall [formula] so u∈Z and [formula]. By these comments u  -  ψ∈Z and [formula]. Therefore u  -  ψ∈E so [formula]. This contradicts [formula] so Z = Z'. The result follows.

We mention two corollaries of Theorem [\ref=thm:centerbasis].

Assume that q is not a root of unity. Then Z(Δ) is generated by Ω, α, β, γ.

Let {λi}4i = 1 denote mutually commuting indeterminates. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in {λi}4i = 1 that have all coefficients in [formula].

Assume that q is not a root of unity. Then there exists an [formula]-algebra isomorphism [formula] that sends

The [formula]-Onsager algebra [formula]

In the theory of tridiagonal pairs there is an algebra known as the tridiagonal algebra [\cite=qSerre]. This algebra is defined using several parameters, and for a certain value of these parameters the algebra is sometimes called the q-Onsager algebra O [\cite=basnc]. Our next goal is to show how O and Δ are related. In this section we define O and discuss some of its properties. In the next section we will relate O and Δ.

Let O  =  Oq denote the [formula]-algebra defined by generators X, Y and relations We call O the q-Onsager algebra.

The following definition is motivated by Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres].

Let ξ1, ξ2 denote the following elements of O:

Referring to Definition [\ref=lem:RS], we are going to show that ξ1, ξ2 commute if and only if [formula]. We will use the following results, which apply to any [formula]-algebra.

Let x, y denote elements in any [formula]-algebra, and consider the commutator

The element [\eqref=lem:com12] is equal to

The element [\eqref=lem:com12] times [3]q is equal to where [u,v]ε means εuv - ε- 1vu.

(i) Expand ([\ref=lem:com12]) and simplify the result. (ii) Expand ([\ref=eq:double]) and compare it with the expression in (i) above.

We return our attention to the elements ξ1, ξ2 in O.

Referring to Definition [\ref=lem:RS], the elements ξ1, ξ2 commute if and only if [formula].

First assume [formula], so that [3]q is nonzero. Applying Lemma [\ref=lem:gen](ii) to the elements x = X and y = Y in the algebra O, we find that [ξ1,ξ2] times [3]q is equal to We show that the element ([\ref=eq:bigf]) is zero. Observe Similarly Therefore Similarly By these comments the element ([\ref=eq:bigf]) is zero, and therefore ξ1, ξ2 commute.

Next assume q6 = 1, so that [3]q = 0 and (q2 - q- 2)2 =  - 3. In this case the relations ([\ref=eq:td1]), ([\ref=eq:td2]) become In the above line the relation on the left (resp. right) asserts that X3 - 3X (resp. Y3 - 3Y) commutes with Y (resp. X) and is therefore central in O. We show that ξ1, ξ2 do not commute by displaying an O-module on which [ξ1,ξ2] is nonzero. Define a group G to be the free product H  *  K where each of H, K is a cylic group of order 3. Let h (resp. k) denote a generator for H (resp. K). Let [formula] denote the group [formula]-algebra. We give [formula] an O-module structure. To do this we specify the action of X, Y on the basis G of [formula]. For the identity 1∈G let X.1 = h and Y.1 = k. For [formula] write [formula] such that for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, gi∈{h,h- 1} for one parity of i and gi∈{k,k- 1} for the other parity of i. Let X, Y act on g as follows:

We have now specified the actions of X, Y on G. These actions give [formula] an O-module structure on which X3 = 3X and Y3 = 3Y. For the O-module [formula] we now apply [ξ1,ξ2] to the vector 1. By Lemma [\ref=lem:gen](i) and the construction, the element [ξ1,ξ2] sends 1 to The above element of [formula] is nonzero. Therefore [formula] so ξ1, ξ2 do not commute.

How [formula] and [formula] are related

Recall the q-Onsager algebra O from Definition [\ref=def:qons]. In this section we discuss how O and Δ are related.

Let λ denote an indeterminate that commutes with everything in O. Let O[λ] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in λ that have all coefficients in O. We view O as an [formula]-subalgebra of O[λ].

There exists a unique [formula]-algebra homomorphism φ:O[λ]  →  Δ that sends Moreover φ is surjective.

Compare Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres] and Definition [\ref=def:qons].

Let J denote the 2-sided ideal of O[λ] generated by (q - q- 1)2ξ1λ  +  ξ2, where ξ1, ξ2 are from Definition [\ref=lem:RS]. By Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres], J is the kernel of φ. Therefore φ induces an isomorphism of [formula]-algebras O[λ] / J  →  Δ.

The [formula]-algebra Δ is isomorphic to O[λ] / J, where J is the 2-sided ideal of O[λ] generated by (q - q- 1)2ξ1λ  +  ξ2.

We now adjust our point of view.

Let φ:O  →  Δ denote the [formula]-algebra homomorphism that sends X  ↦  A and Y  ↦  B. Observe that φ is the restriction of φ to O.

We now describe the image and kernel of the homomorphism φ in Definition [\ref=def:hatvp]. We will use the following notation.

For any subset S  ⊆  Δ let 〈S〉 denote the [formula]-subalgebra of Δ generated by S.

For the homomorphism φ:O  →  Δ from Definition  [\ref=def:hatvp], the image is 〈A,B〉. The kernel is [formula], where J is defined above Theorem  [\ref=thm:97].

Routine.

We are going to show that φ is not injective. To do this we display some nonzero elements in the kernel [formula].

[formula] contains the elements Here ξ1, ξ2 are from Definition  [\ref=lem:RS].

Let z be given. Each of z, ξ1, ξ2 is in O so ξ1zξ2  -  ξ2zξ1∈O. The element ξ1zξ2  -  ξ2zξ1 is equal to and is therefore contained in J. The result follows.

We now display some elements z in O such that ξ1zξ2  -  ξ2zξ1 is nonzero. For general q we cannot take z = 1 in view of Proposition [\ref=lem:RS2], so we proceed to the next simplest case.

The following elements of O are nonzero: Moreover [formula] is nonzero.

To show ξ1Xξ2  -  ξ2Xξ1 is nonzero we display an O-module on which ξ1Xξ2  -  ξ2Xξ1 is nonzero. This O-module is a variation on an O-module due to M. Vidar [\cite=Vidar]. Define θi  =  q2i + q- 2i for i = 0,1,2. Define ϑ  =  (q4 - q- 4)(q2 - q- 2)(q - q- 1)2. Adapting [\cite=Vidar] there exists a four-dimensional O-module V with the following property: V has a basis with respect to which the matrices representing X, Y are Consider the matrix that represents ξ1Xξ2  -  ξ2Xξ1 with respect to the above basis. For this matrix the (4,3)-entry is - q2. This entry is nonzero so ξ1Xξ2  -  ξ2Xξ1 is nonzero. Interchanging the roles of X, Y in the above argument, we see that ξ1Yξ2  -  ξ2Yξ1 is nonzero. The result follows.

The homomorphism φ:O  →  Δ from Definition  [\ref=def:hatvp] is not injective.

Combine Lemma [\ref=def:hatvpbasic] and Lemma [\ref=lem:nonz].

The 2-sided ideal [formula]

We will be discussing the following subspace of Δ: Observe that Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ is the 2-sided ideal of Δ generated by [Δ,Δ]. In this section we describe this ideal from several points of view.

Let [formula], [formula], [formula] denote mutually commuting indeterminates. Let [formula] denote the [formula]-algebra consisting of the polynomials in [formula], [formula], [formula] that have all coefficients in [formula].

There exists a unique [formula]-algebra homomorphism [formula] that sends This homomorphism is surjective.

The algebra [formula] is commutative, so each of is central in [formula]. Consequently [formula], [formula], [formula] satisfy the defining relations for Δ from Definition [\ref=def:uaw]. Therefore the homomorphism exists. The homomorphism is unique since A, B, C generate Δ. The homomorphism is surjective since [formula], [formula], [formula] generate [formula].

Referring to the map [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:com2], for all u∈Δ let [formula] denote the image of u.

We have

The assertions about α, β, γ follow from Definition [\ref=def:abc]. The assertion about Ω follows from its definition in Lemma [\ref=lem:six].

The following coincide:

The 2-sided ideal Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ;

The kernel of the homomorphism [formula] from Lemma  [\ref=lem:com2].

Let Γ denote the kernel of the homomorphism [formula] and note that Γ is a 2-sided ideal of Δ. We have [Δ,Δ]  ⊆  Γ since [formula] is commutative, and Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ  ⊆  Γ since Γ is a 2-sided ideal of Δ. The elements [formula] form a basis for the [formula]-vector space [formula]. Therefore the elements {AiBjCk|i,j,k  ≥  0} form a basis for a complement of Γ in Δ. Denote this complement by M, so the sum Δ = M + Γ is direct. We now show Δ = M + Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ. The [formula]-algebra Δ is generated by A, B, C. Therefore the [formula]-vector space Δ is spanned by elements of the form [formula] where n  ≥  0 and xi∈{A,B,C} for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n. Let [formula] denote such an element. Then Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ contains for 2  ≤  i  ≤  n. Therefore Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ contains where i, j, k denote the number of times A, B, C appear among [formula]. Observe AiBjCk∈M so [formula]. Therefore Δ = M + Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ. We already showed Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ  ⊆  Γ and the sum Δ = M + Γ is direct. By these comments Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ  =  Γ.

Recall the [formula]-action on Δ from Theorem [\ref=thm:try]. We now relate this action to the homomorphism [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:com2].

The group [formula] acts on [formula] as a group of automorphisms in the following way:

[formula]

[formula] has an automorphism of order 3 that sends [formula], and an automorphism of order 2 that sends [formula].

For [formula] the following diagram commutes:

[formula]

Without loss we may assume that g is one of ρ, σ. By Theorem [\ref=thm:try] the action of ρ on Δ cyclically permutes A, B, C. By Lemma [\ref=lem:overlineaction] the action of ρ on [formula] cyclically permutes [formula], [formula], [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=thm:try] the action of σ on Δ swaps A,B and fixes γ. By Lemma [\ref=lem:com2a] and Lemma [\ref=lem:overlineaction], the action of σ on [formula] swaps [formula], [formula] and fixes [formula]. By these comments the diagram commutes.

By Lemma [\ref=lem:overlineaction] each element of [formula] permutes [formula], [formula], [formula]. This induces a group homomorphism from [formula] onto the symmetric group S3. Let [formula] denote the kernel of this homomorphism. Thus [formula] is a normal subgroup of [formula] and the quotient group [formula] is isomorphic to S3.

Our last main goal is to show that Note that in ([\ref=eq:fnlgl]) the sum on the left is direct; otherwise the ideal Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ contains 1 and is therefore equal to Δ, contradicting Proposition [\ref=lem:coincide].

For notational convenience abbreviate [formula]. Thus [formula] is the image of O under the homomoprhism φ from Definition [\ref=def:hatvp].

[formula].

The algebra Δ is generated by [formula], γ. Moreover γ is central in Δ.

The sum in Lemma [\ref=lem:notdir] is not direct, by the third displayed equation in Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres].

Note that [formula] is the 2-sided ideal of [formula] generated by [A,B].

The following (i)-(iii) hold.

[formula].

[formula].

[formula].

(i) Abbreviate [formula] and consider the quotient algebra [formula]. The elements A, B generate [formula], and these generators satisfy [A,B]∈R. Therefore A + R, B + R generate [formula], and these generators commute. This shows that [formula] is commutative. Consider the canonical map [formula]. This map has kernel R. The map sends [formula] since [formula] is commutative. Therefore [formula].

(ii) In the third displayed equation of Theorem [\ref=prop:altpres], the expression on the right is a nonzero scalar multiple of [A,B]γ. The expression on the left is equal to [A2,B2] + (q2 + q- 2)[B,ABA] and is therefore in [formula]. The result follows.

(iii) By (i), (ii) above and since γ is central.

[formula] is a 2-sided ideal of Δ.

Abbreviate [formula]. We show ΔR  ⊆  R and RΔ  ⊆  R. Recall that Δ is generated by [formula], γ. By construction [formula] and [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem:three](iii) and since γ is central we have γR  ⊆  R and Rγ  ⊆  R. By these comments ΔR  ⊆  R and RΔ  ⊆  R.

We have

We have [formula] and [A,B]∈[Δ,Δ] so [formula]. We now show the reverse inclusion. To this end we analyze [Δ,Δ] using Lemma [\ref=lem:notdir]. For integers m,n  ≥  0, By this and Lemma [\ref=lem:notdir] we obtain [formula]. Now using Lemma [\ref=lem:ideal] we obtain [formula]. The result follows.

In the algebra [formula] let [formula] (resp. [formula]) (resp. [formula]) denote the subalgebra generated by [formula], [formula] (resp. [formula], [formula]) (resp. [formula], [formula]).

Referring to the homomorphism [formula] from Lemma  [\ref=lem:com2],

〈A,B〉 is the preimage of [formula];

〈B,C〉 is the preimage of [formula];

〈A,C〉 is the preimage of [formula].

(i) Recall [formula]. For the homomorphism in the proposition statement the image of [formula] is [formula]. Therefore the preimage of [formula] is [formula] plus the kernel. The kernel is Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ by Proposition [\ref=lem:coincide], and this is contained in [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lem:comu]. Therefore [formula] is the preimage of [formula].

(ii), (iii) Apply ρ twice to everything in part (i) above.

[formula].

By Proposition [\ref=lem:coincide], Proposition [\ref=thm:nice], and since [formula].

We finish with some comments related to Proposition [\ref=thm:nice] and Theorem [\ref=thm:big].

In the table below, each space U is a subalgebra of Δ that contains Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ. The elements to the right of U form a basis for a complement of Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ in U.

By Proposition [\ref=lem:coincide] and Proposition [\ref=thm:nice].

The automorphisms ρ and σ permute the subalgebras in the following way:

[formula]

By Lemmas [\ref=lem:overlineaction], [\ref=lem:comdiagoverline] and Proposition [\ref=thm:nice].

By Proposition [\ref=prop:groupaction] the action of [formula] on Δ induces an action of [formula] on the 3-element set ([\ref=eq:3set]). The kernel of this action is the group [formula] from Definition [\ref=def:P].

Each of the subalgebras is invariant under the group [formula] from Definition  [\ref=def:P].

Directions for further research

In this section we give some suggestions for further research. Recall the algebra Δ from Definition [\ref=def:uaw].

Recall from the Introduction that Δ was originally motivated by the Askey-Wilson polynomials. These polynomials are the most general family in a master class of orthogonal polynomials called the Askey scheme [\cite=KoeSwa]. For each polynomial family in the Askey scheme, there should be an analog of Δ obtained from the appropriate version of AW(3) by interpreting parameters as central elements. Investigate these other algebras along the lines of the present paper.

For this problem assume the characteristic of [formula] is not 2. By Theorem [\ref=thm:try] and Theorem [\ref=thm:faith] the group [formula] acts faithfully on Δ as a group of automorphisms. This action induces an injection of groups [formula]. This injection is not an isomorphism for the following reason. Given any element of Δ among A, B, C there exists a unique automorphism of Δ that fixes that element and changes the sign of the other two elements. This automorphism is not contained in the image of the above injection, because its induced action on [formula] does not match the description given in Definition [\ref=def:P]. The above three automorphisms are the nonidentity elements in a subgroup [formula] that is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group [formula]. Do [formula] and [formula] together generate Aut(Δ)?

View the [formula]-vector space Δ as a [formula]-module. Describe the irreducible [formula]-submodules of Δ. Is Δ a direct sum of irreducible [formula]-submodules?

Describe the [formula]-submodule of Δ that is generated by 〈A〉. Also, describe the [formula]-submodule of Δ that is generated by 〈A〉.

Consider the basis for Δ given in Theorem [\ref=thm:basis] or Theorem [\ref=lem:basis2]. Find the matrices that represent ρ and σ with respect to this basis. Find the matrices that represent left-multiplication by A, B, C with respect to this basis. Hopefully the entries in the above matrices are attractive in some way. If not, then find a basis for Δ with respect to which the above matrix entries are attractive.

Find a basis for the center Z(Δ) under the assumption q is a root of unity.

Give a basis for the [formula]-vector space Δ[Δ,Δ]Δ.

Recall the homomorhism [formula] from Lemma [\ref=lem:com2]. Restrict this homomorphism to Z(Δ) or 〈A,Z(Δ)〉. In each case find a basis for the kernel and image.

Motivated by Theorem [\ref=thm:try], let us view Δ as a Lie algebra with Lie bracket [u,v]  =  uv - vu for all u,v∈Δ.

Let L denote the Lie subalgebra of Δ generated by A, B, C. Show that Show that L is [formula]-invariant. Find a basis for the [formula]-vector space L. Describe [formula]. Give a presentation for L by generators and relations.
