Technicolor Explanation for the CDF Wjj Excess

The CDF Collaboration has reported a surprising excess at Mjj≃150  GeV in the dijet mass distribution of W  +  jets events. Fitting the excess to a Gaussian, CDF estimated its production rate to be ~  4  pb. This is 300 times the standard model Higgs rate σ(p  →  WH)B(H  →  b). The Gaussian fit is consistent with a zero-width resonance. Its significance, for a search window of 120-200  GeV and including systematic uncertainties, is 3.2  σ [\cite=Aaltonen:2011mk].

In our view the most plausible new-physics explanation of this excess is resonant production and decay of bound states of technicolor (TC), a new strong interaction at ΛTC  ~   several 100  GeV of massless technifermions [\cite=Weinberg:1979bn] [\cite=Susskind:1978ms] [\cite=Hill:2002ap] [\cite=Lane:2002wv]. These technifermions are assumed to belong to complex representations of the TC gauge group and transform as quarks and leptons do under electroweak (EW) [formula]. Then, the spontaneous breaking of their chiral symmetry breaks EW symmetry down to electromagnetic U(1) with a massless photon and [formula]. We propose that the dijet resonance is the lightest pseudo-Goldstone isovector technipion (πT) of the low-scale technicolor scenario. The immediate consequence of this hypothesis is a narrow I = 1 technirho (ρT) resonance in the Wjj channel. This accounts for the large WπT production rate.

In this Letter we show that a ρT of mass ≃290  GeV decaying into W plus πT of 160  GeV accounts for the CDF dijet excess. The ρT signal sits near the peak of the MWjj distribution and will be less obvious than πT  →  jj. We suggest ways to enhance this signal and tests of the ρT's presence: (1) The ρT's narrowness will be reflected in Q  =  MWjj  -  Mjj  -  MW [\cite=Eichten:1997yq] [\cite=Aaltonen:2009jb]. The Mjj bins near MπT will exhibit a sharp increase over background for Q≃Q*  =  MρT  -  MπT  -  MW. (2) The ρT  →  WπT angular distribution in the ρT frame will be approximately sin 2θ, indicative of the signal's technicolor origin. We propose further tests of the technicolor hypothesis, including other resonantly produced states which can be discovered at the Tevatron and LHC.

Low-scale technicolor (LSTC) is a phenomenology based on walking technicolor [\cite=Holdom:1981rm] [\cite=Appelquist:1986an] [\cite=Yamawaki:1986zg] [\cite=Akiba:1986rr]. The TC gauge coupling must run very slowly for 100s of TeV above ΛTC so that extended technicolor (ETC) can generate sizable quark and lepton masses  while suppressing flavor-changing neutral current interactions [\cite=Eichten:1979ah]. This may be achieved if technifermions belong to higher-dimensional representations of the TC gauge group. Then, the constraints of Ref. [\cite=Eichten:1979ah] on the number of ETC-fermion representations imply technifermions in the fundamental representation as well. Thus, there are technifermions whose technipions' decay constant F21  ≪  F2π  =  (246  GeV)2 [\cite=Lane:1989ej]. Bound states of these technifermions will have masses well below a TeV -- greater than the limit [formula] [\cite=Abazov:2006iq] [\cite=Aaltonen:2009jb] and probably less than the 600-700 GeV at which "low-scale" TC ceases to make sense. Technifermions in complex TC representations imply a quarkonium-like spectrum of mesons. The most accessible are the lightest technivectors, VT  =  ρT(IGJPC  =  1+1-  -), ωT(0-1-  -) and aT(1-1+  +); these are produced as s-channel resonances in the Drell-Yan process in hadron colliders. Technipions πT(1-0-  +) are accessed in VT decays. A central assumption of LSTC is that these technihadrons may be treated in isolation, without significant mixing or other interference from higher-mass states. Also, we expect that (1) the lightest technifermions are SU(3)-color singlets, (2) isospin violation is small for VT and πT, (3) [formula], and (4) MaT is not far above MρT. An extensive discussion of LSTC, including these points and precision electroweak constraints, is given in Ref. [\cite=Lane:2009ct].

Walking technicolor has another important consequence: it enhances MπT relative to MρT so that the all-πT decay channels of the VT likely are closed [\cite=Lane:1989ej]. Principal VT-decay modes are WπT, ZπT, γπT, a pair of EW bosons (including one photon), and fermion-antifermion pairs [\cite=Lane:2002sm] [\cite=Eichten:2007sx] [\cite=Lane:2009ct]. If allowed by isospin, parity and angular momentum, VT decays to one or more weak bosons involve longitudinally-polarized WL / ZL, the technipions absorbed via the Higgs mechanism. These nominally strong decays are suppressed by powers of sin χ  =  F1 / Fπ  ≪  1. Decays to transversely-polarized [formula] are suppressed by g,g'. Thus, the VT are very narrow, [formula]. These decays provide striking signatures, visible above backgrounds within a limited mass range at the Tevatron and probably up to 600-700 GeV at the LHC [\cite=Brooijmans:2008se] [\cite=Brooijmans:2010tn].

Previous ρT  →  WπT searches at the Tevatron focused on final states with [formula] and πT  →  q where one or both quarks was a tagged b. This was advocated in Ref. [\cite=Eichten:1997yq] because πT couplings to standard-model fermions are induced by ETC interactions and are, naively, expected to be largest for the heaviest fermions. Thus, π+T  →  c, u and π0T  →  b has been assumed, at least for [formula]. While reasonable for π0T decays, it is questionable for π±T because CKM-like angles may suppress q. This is important because the inclusive σ(ūu,d  →  ρ0T)≃1.6  ×    σ(u,ūd  →  ρ±T) at the Tevatron. If π+T  →  q is turned off in the default model of πT decays used here [\cite=Lane:2002sm], up to 40% of the ρT  →  WπT  →  Wjj signal is vetoed by a b-tag . It is notable, therefore, that the CDF observation did not require b-tagged jets [\cite=Aaltonen:2011mk].

At first, it seems unlikely that ρT  →  WπT could be found in untagged dijets because of the large W + jets background. However, Ref. [\cite=Mrenna:1999xj] studied ρT  →  Wπ0T without flavor-tagging and showed that a πT  →  jj signal could be extracted. Recently, strong W / Z  →  jj signals have been observed in WW / WZ production at the Tevatron [\cite=Aaltonen:2009vh] [\cite=Aaltonen:2010rq]. So, heavier dijet states resonantly produced with W / Z / γ may indeed be discoverable at the Tevatron.

The CDF dijet excess was enhanced by requiring pT(jj) > 40  GeV [\cite=Aaltonen:2011mk]. Such a cut was proposed in Ref. [\cite=Eichten:1997yq]. There it was emphasized that the small Q-value in ρT  →  WπT and the fact that the ρT is approximately at rest in the Tevatron lab frame cause the πT to be emitted with limited pT and its decay jets to be roughly back-to-back in φ.

Pythia 6.4 is used throughout to generate the ρT  →  WπT signal [\cite=Sjostrand:2006za]. It employs the default πT-decay model of Ref. [\cite=Lane:2002sm] in which π+T  →  q is unhindered. The input masses are (MρT,  MπT)  =  (290,  160)  GeV. This MπT gives a peak in the simulated Mjj distribution near 150  GeV . This parameter choice is close to Case 2b of Contribution 8 in Ref. [\cite=Brooijmans:2010tn].

The signal cross sections ( including B(π0T  →  q)≃0.90, B(π±T  →  q')≃0.95, and [formula]) are σ(W±π∓T)  =  310  fb and σ(W±π0T)  =  175  fb . Only 20-30% of these cross sections come from the 320  GeV [formula]. If MaT  =  293  GeV, they increase slightly to 335  fb and 205  fb. If π+T  →  q is suppressed, then σ(W±π∓T)  =  110  fb, a decrease of 2/3, for a total Wjj signal of 285  fb.

Backgrounds come from standard model W / Z  +  jets, including b,  c-jets, WW / WZ, t, and multijet QCD. The last two amount to ~  10% at the Tevatron and we neglect them. The others are generated at parton level with ALPGENv13 [\cite=Mangano:2002ea] and fed into Pythia for showering and hadronization. The Pythia particle-level output is distributed into calorimeter cells of size Δη  ×  Δφ  =  0.1  ×  0.1. After isolated leptons (and photons) are removed, all remaining cells with ET  >  1  GeV are used for jet-finding. Jets are defined using a midpoint cone algorithm with R  =  0.4. For simplicity, we did not smear calorimeter energies; this does not significantly broaden our Mjj resolution near MπT.

In extracting the πT and ρT signals, we first adopted the cuts used by CDF [\cite=Aaltonen:2011mk],. Our results are in Fig. [\ref=fig:CDF_mass_dists]. The data correspond to [formula]. They reproduce the shape and normalization of CDF's Mjj [\cite=Aaltonen:2011mk] and MWjj [\cite=Cavaliere:2010zz] distributions (except that not smearing calorimeter energies does make our W  →  jj signal a narrow spike). We obtain S / B  =  250 / 1595 for the dijet signal in the five bins in 120-160 GeV. We find this agreement with CDF's measurement remarkable. Our model inputs are standard defaults, chosen only to match the dijet resonance position and the small Q-value of ρT  →  WπT. The ρT resonance is near the peak of the MWjj distribution . For the six bins in 240-300 GeV, we obtain S / B  =  235 / 3390.

We then augmented the CDF cuts to enhance the signals. CDF required exactly two jets. We achieved greater acceptance and a modest sharpening of the dijet peak by combining a third jet with one of the two leading jets if it was within ΔR  =  1.5 of either of them. We enhanced the πT and, especially, the ρT signals by imposing topological cuts taking advantage of the ρT  →  WπT kinematics [\cite=Eichten:1997yq]: (1) Δφ(j1j2)  >  1.75 and (2) [formula]. The improvements seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:ELM_CDF_mass_dists] are significant. We obtain S / B  =  200 / 800 for πT  →  jj and S / B  =  215 / 1215 for ρT  →  Wjj. Extracting the ρT signal will require confidence in the background shape.

In addition to the jj and Wjj resonances, the Q-value and the ρT-decay angular distribution are indicative of resonant production of WπT. The resolution in Q  =  MWjj  -  Mjj  -  MW is better than in Mjj and MWjj alone because jet measurement errors partially cancel. This is seen in Fig. [\ref=fig:Q_angular] where we plot ΔN(Mjj)  =  Nobserved(Mjj) - Nexpected(Mjj)  =  NS + B(Mjj)  -  NB(Mjj) for Q  ≤  Q max vs. Q max for six 16-GeV Mjj bins between 86 and 182  GeV. The sudden increase at Q max≃50  GeV in the three signal bins is clear.

The decay ρT  →  WπT is dominated by WLπT. Therefore, the angular distribution of q  →  ρT  →  WπT is approximately sin 2θ, where θ is the angle between the incoming quark and the outgoing W in the ρT frame [\cite=Eichten:2007sx]. The backgrounds are forward-backward peaked. We required pT(W)  >  40  GeV, fit the background in 250  <  MWjj  <  300  GeV with a quartic in cos θ, and subtracted it from the total. (In reality, of course, one would use sidebands.) The prediction in Fig. [\ref=fig:Q_angular] matches the normalized sin 2θ well. Verification of this would strongly support the TC origin of the signal.

1) It is important to find the ωT and aT states, expected to be close to ρT, near 300  GeV. At the Tevatron, the largest production rates involve ωT  →  γπ0T and a±T  →  γπ±T. For our input parameters, these are 80  fb and 185  fb, respectively. Their existence, masses and production rates critically test the technifermions' TC representation structure and the strength of the dimension-five operators inducing these decays. In addition, recent papers from DØ [\cite=Abazov:2010ti] and CDF [\cite=Aaltonen:2011xp] suggest that the e+e- channel is promising. The excess (signal) cross sections for our parameters are σ(ωT,ρ0T  →  e+e-)  =  12  fb and σ(a0T  →  e+e-)  =  7  fb.

2) Finding these LSTC signatures at the LHC is complicated by t and other multijet backgrounds. The likely discovery and study channels at the LHC are the nonhadronic final states of ρ±T  →  W±Z0; ρ±T,a±T  →  γW±, and [formula] [\cite=Brooijmans:2008se] [\cite=Brooijmans:2010tn]. The dilepton channel may well be the earliest target of opportunity.

3) The b and τ-fractions of πT decays should be determined as well as possible. They probe the ETC couplings of quarks and leptons to technifermions, a key part of the flavor physics of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking [\cite=Eichten:1979ah].

If experiments at the Tevatron and LHC reveal a spectrum resembling these predictions, it could well be that low-scale technicolor is the "Rosetta Stone" of electroweak symmetry breaking. For it will then be possible to know its dynamical origin and discern the character of its basic constituents, the technifermions. The masses and quantum numbers of their bound states will provide stringent experimental benchmarks for the theoretical studies of the strong dynamics of walking technicolor just now getting started, see e.g. [\cite=Appelquist:2010xv].
