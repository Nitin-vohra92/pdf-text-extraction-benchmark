Introduction

Let G  =  (V,E) be a simple graph with n  =  |V| vertices and m  =  |E| edges. The first Zagreb index M1 and the second Zagreb index M2 of G are defined as follows:

[formula]

where [formula] are vertex degrees, while didj represents weight associated to the edge (i,j). The Zagreb indices were first introduced in [\cite=GuTr72] and the survey of properties of M1 and M2 is given in [\cite=NiKMT03]. Note that in random graphs with n vertices and uniform edge probability p, the order of magnitude of M1 is O(n3p2), while the order of magnitude of M2 is O(n4p3), implying that M1 / n and M2 / m have the same order of magnitude O(n2p2). This led to the following conjecture posed in [\cite=HaVu07]: It was shown in [\cite=HaVu07] that this conjecture is not true in general by finding a disconnected counterexample consisting of a six-vertex star and a triangle, and a connected counterexample on 46 vertices and 110 edges. Nevertheless, it was proven in [\cite=HaVu07] that the conjecture holds for chemical graphs. Further, it was proven in [\cite=VuGr07] that the conjecture holds for trees (with equality attained for and only for stars), while in [\cite=Li08] it was proven that the conjecture holds for connected unicyclic graphs (with equality attained for and only for cycles).

Our goal here is twofold, both in favor of a conjecture and against it:

We show that the expressions M1 / n and M2 / m are both bounded with [formula] from below and with [formula] from above, with equality attained for and only for regular graphs. We also establish lower bounds for variable Zagreb indices.

We show that for any fixed number k  ≥  2, there exists a connected graph with k cycles for which M1 / n > M2 / m holds, effectively showing that the conjecture cannot hold unless there exists some kind of limitation on the number of cycles or the maximum vertex degree in a graph. In particular, we prove that the conjecture holds for subdivision graphs.

Common lower and upper bounds

The following two theorems give sharp lower bounds for M1 and M2. Recall that for a graph with n vertices and m edges, the average value of vertex degrees is 2m  /  n.

It holds that [formula]. The equality is attained if and only if graph is regular.

We use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality on vectors [formula] and [formula] to get

[formula]

Equality holds if and only if [formula], namely if and only if G is regular.

For positive real numbers [formula] the following inequality holds:

[formula]

The function f(x)  =  x ln x is strictly convex on interval (0, +   ∞  ), since its second derivative [formula] is positive. The inequality ([\ref=eq-ineq]) follows directly from the Jensen's inequality [\cite=HaLP98]

[formula]

Equality holds in ([\ref=eq-ineq]) if and only if all xi are equal.

It holds that [formula]. The equality is attained if and only if graph is regular.

First we use the inequality between the arithmetic and the geometric mean:

[formula]

Since [formula], we take the natural logarithm of both sides to get

[formula]

Then from Lemma [\ref=le-xlnx] we get:

[formula]

and finally

[formula]

Equality holds if and only if [formula], i.e., if and only if G is regular.

From two previous theorems, we see that the expressions from Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] have common sharp lower bound:

[formula]

Next we show that these expressions also have common sharp upper bound.

Let Δ be the maximum vertex degree in G. Then

[formula]

Equality is attained simultaneously in both inequalities if and only if G is regular.

The first inequality is equivalent to the obvious inequality [formula], while the second inequality is equivalent to [formula]. Then

[formula]

Equality is attained in both inequalities simultaneously if and only if di  =  Δ for every [formula], i.e., if and only if G is regular.

Now, using the upper bound on M1 from [\cite=Das04] (where Δ is the maximum, while δ is the minimum vertex degree):

[formula]

with equality if and only if G is a star graph or a regular graph or [formula], we see that the expressions M1 / n and M2 / m also have common upper bound in terms of n, m, Δ and δ:

[formula]

Equality is attained simultaneously in above inequalities if and only if G is regular.

These indices have been generalized to variable first and second Zagreb indices defined as

[formula]

More results about comparing variable Zagreb indices can be found in [\cite=Vu07] and [\cite=VuGr08]. For [formula], we define p  =  2λ and [formula] in order to establish relation [formula]. Now we use Hölder inequality [\cite=HaLP98] on vectors [formula] and [formula] to get

[formula]

Next, raise each side of equation to the power of 2λ

[formula]

The last inequality is equivalent with

[formula]

For the variable second Zagreb index and every [formula] it holds

[formula]

We can use the same technique as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=second] and get lower bound:

[formula]

Also, we have similar upper bounds for variable Zagreb indices:

[formula]

Counterexamples

Let C(a,b) be a graph that is composed of (a  +  1)-vertex star with exactly b triangles attached in line at arbitrary leaf (see Figure 1). If triangles have vertex labels vi,ui,wi, where [formula], then there exist edges uivi  +  1 for every [formula], and vertex v1 is connected with an arbitrary leaf of star Sa  +  1.

Assume that [formula] and [formula]. It is obvious that the number of vertices of C(a,b) is n  =  a  +  3b  +  1 and the number of edges is m  =  a  +  4b. Also note that C(a,b) has exactly b cycles.

In C(a,b) there is one vertex of degree a and a  -  1 pendent vertices. Every triangle has vertex degrees 3,3,2, except for the last one which has 3,2,2. Now we can calculate the first Zagreb index:

[formula]

The weight of a  -  1 pendent edges is equal to a  ·  1, while every triangle has weights 9,6,6, except for the last one which has 6,6,4. The edges connecting triangles have weight 9, and therefore,

[formula]

The Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] is equivalent to [formula], which for the graph C(a,b) yields:

[formula]

i.e.,

[formula]

Next, fix the number of cycles [formula]. The left-hand side of ([\ref=eq-ab]) is a quadratic function in a. Since the coefficient of a2 is negative, and the discriminant

[formula]

is greater than zero for [formula], we get that the left-hand side value of ([\ref=eq-ab]) is negative for

[formula]

Thus, each value of a satisfying ([\ref=eq-alower]) yields a counterexample to Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] with b cycles. In particular, for b = 2 we get that any [formula] yields a counterexample to the conjecture and the smallest counterexample of this form is shown in Figure 1.

Conclusion

From the previous section it is evident that the Conjecture [\ref=conjecture] cannot hold unless there exists some kind of limitation on either the maximum vertex degree or the number of cycles in a graph. This limitation may be implicitly given, as it becomes evident from the following example.

The subdivision graph S(G) of a graph G is obtained by inserting a new vertex of degree two on each edge of G. If G has n vertices and m edges, then S(G) has n  +  m vertices and 2m edges. Clearly, S(G) is bipartite.

Let S(G) be a subdivision graph of G. Then,

[formula]

with equality if and only if G is a regular graph.

The vertex degrees of G remain the same in the subdivision graph S(G), while the new vertices have degree two. Thus,

[formula]

Every edge (i,j) of G is subdivided in two parts with weights 2di and 2dj. Therefore,

[formula]

Using these formulas, we get that the inequality [formula] is equivalent to [formula], i.e., to [formula], which is true by Theorem [\ref=first]. The case of equality easily follows.
