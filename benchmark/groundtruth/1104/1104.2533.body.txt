Hilbert function spaces and the Nevanlinna-Pick problem on the polydisc

Introduction

Overview

The Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] is to determine, given distinct nodes λ1,...,λN in [formula] and target points ω1,...,ωN in [formula], whether there exists a function F analytic on [formula] with [formula] that satisfies F(λi) = ωi for each i. A problem is called extremal if a solution F satisfying ||F||∞ = 1 exists and no solution G satisfying ||G||∞ < 1 exists.

Given a problem on [formula], let U denote the set of uniqueness for the problem, the largest set on which all solutions agree. For n = 1, if a problem is extremal, then Pick's 1916 results imply that the solution is unique, i.e. [formula]. On the other hand, for n > 1, the following example shows that a problem may be extremal and yet fail to have a unique solution, i.e. [formula].

Various authors have studied the uniqueness properties of the Nevanlinna-Pick problem on the polydisc: in [\cite=baltre98], Ball and Trent show how to parameterize a certain class of solutions associated to a given Pick problem on [formula]; in [\cite=agmc_three], Agler and McCarthy classify those 2 and 3 point Pick problems on [formula] that have a unique solution; in [\cite=GHW] Guo, Huang and Wang give sufficient conditions for a 3 point Pick problem on [formula] to have a unique solution; and in [\cite=dsPLn], a work closely related to this work, the present author gives a geometric procedure for constructing a Pick problem on [formula] with a unique solution.

The starting points of this work is a result from [\cite=agmc_dv]. To state it, we say that an algebraic variety [formula] is inner if each of it's irreducible components Vi meets [formula] and exits [formula] through the n-torus, i.e. [formula] and [formula].

Given an extremal Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula], there exists a 1-dimensional inner variety V such that all solutions to the problem agree on [formula], i.e. [formula].

Theorem [\ref=agmc_ext] suggests that one ask if every 1-dimensional inner variety [formula] is contained in the uniqueness set of some problem. Our first result answers this question in the affirmative on [formula].

Given a 1-dimensional inner variety [formula], there exists an extremal Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] such that [formula] is the set of uniqueness for the problem, i.e. [formula].

Theorem [\ref=EachInner] suggests that one ask if every inner variety [formula], not necessarily 1-dimensional, is the set of uniqueness for some Pick problem on [formula]. Our second result gives a partial answer.

Given k  ≤  n there exists a k-dimensional inner variety [formula] and a Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] such that [formula] is the set of uniqueness for the problem, i.e. [formula].

We prove Theorems [\ref=EachInner] and [\ref=kUniqueSet] in section 6.

In the remainder of this introduction, we discuss three results of independent interest that will be used to prove Theorems [\ref=EachInner] and [\ref=kUniqueSet], Theorems [\ref=FunctionSpace], [\ref=ThmB] and [\ref=ThmD].

Theorem [\ref=FunctionSpace]

Theorem [\ref=FunctionSpace] gives sufficient conditions for a Nevanlinna-Pick problem on a Hilbert function space to have a unique solution. Given a 1-dimensional inner variety V, we will construct a Hilbert function space on [formula] and use Theorem [\ref=FunctionSpace] to prove that for a certain type of problem on [formula], all solutions agree on [formula]. To state the theorem, we need some notation and the notion of a "Pick uniqueness kernel," defined below.

The multiplier algebra of a Hilbert function space H(X), Mult(H(X)), is the normed algebra of functions φ on X that satisfy φf∈H(X) for each f∈H(X). The norm is given by ||φ|| = ||Mφ||, where Mφ is the bounded linear operator on H(X) defined by Mφf = φf. A set Ω  ⊂  X is a set of uniqueness for Mult(X) if φ1  =  φ2 in Mult(H(X)) whenever φ1,φ2∈Mult(H(X)) and φ1  =  φ2 on Ω. We use Mult1(H(X)) to denote the unit ball of Mult(H(X)).

The Nevanlinna-Pick problem on H(X) is to determine, given nodes λ1,...,λN∈X and target points [formula], whether there exists a φ∈Mult1(H(X)) that satisfies φ(λi) = ωi for each i. For each λ∈X, we use kλ to denote the reproducing kernel at λ, the element of H(X) that represents the linear functional evaluation at λ. Given a problem on H(X) with nodes λ1,...,λN∈X and target points [formula], let kij =  < kλj,kλi  >  . We define two N by N matrices W and K with the following formulas,

[formula]

Finally, we use W  ·  K = ((1 - ωij)kij) to denote the Schur entrywise product of W and K, and call W  ·  K the Pick matrix associated to the problem.

Consider a Hilbert function space H(X) with kernel K. We say that K is a Pick uniqueness kernel if the following holds for each solvable Nevanlinna-Pick problem on H(X): If the Pick matrix W  ·  K associated to the problem is singular, then the problem has a unique solution.

Consider a Hilbert function space H(X) with kernel K. If for each finite set of points λ1,...,λN∈X and non-zero scalars a1,...,aN the complement of the zero set of G(x) = a1kλ1(x) + ... + aNkλN(x) is a set of uniqueness for Mult(H(X)), then K is a Pick uniqueness kernel.

We prove Theorem [\ref=FunctionSpace] in section 2, by generalizing an argument from [\cite=agmc_dv].

Theorem [\ref=ThmB]

Given 1-dimensional inner variety [formula], Theorem [\ref=ThmB] gives a geometric procedure for constructing a problem with the property that [formula]. We will use Theorem [\ref=ThmB] us to establish one half of Theorem [\ref=EachInner].

A rational function [formula] with q,r relatively prime is called inner if [formula] on [formula] and |F(τ)| = 1 for almost every [formula]. A rational inner function F is called regular if q  ≠  0 on [formula]. Given a 1-dimensional inner variety [formula], the rank of V is the n-tuple of the generic number of sheets of V over each coordinate. We define the degree of F on V, deg V(F), as the valence of F on [formula].

Consider a regular rational inner function F on [formula] and an irreducible 1-dimensional inner variety V. If deg V(F) < N and [formula] are distinct, then every solution to the Nevanlinna-Pick problem with data λ1,...,λN and F(λ1),...,F(λN) equals F on [formula], i.e. [formula].

We prove Theorem [\ref=ThmB] in section 3. We give the formula for deg V(F), from [\cite=agmc_dv], in Theorem [\ref=FredholmDegree] of section 3 .

Theorem [\ref=ThmD]

Given an inner variety [formula] and a problem with nodes on V, Theorem [\ref=ThmD] complements Theorem [\ref=ThmB] by establishing sufficient conditions for [formula]. We will use Theorem [\ref=ThmD] to prove Theorems [\ref=EachInner] and [\ref=kUniqueSet], and to partially answer a question by Agler and McCarthy from [\cite=agmc_dv].

Consider a rational inner function [formula] on [formula] with q,r relatively prime. We define the n-degree of F, n-deg (F), as the n-tuple with ith entry given by the degree of r in zi. Given a polynomial p and a rational inner function F, we use Zp to denote the zero set of p and write n-deg (p)  ≤  n-deg (F) if the degree of p in each variable zi is less than or equal to the degree of r in zi. For an inner variety [formula], we use the notation n-deg (V)  ≤  n-deg (F) to mean that there exist irreducible polynomials p1,...,pr such that [formula] and n-deg (pk)  ≤  n-deg (F) for each k. If a rational inner function Fε satisfies Fε = F on [formula] and Fε  ≠  F on [formula], then we call Fε a rational inner perturbation of F on V.

If V is an inner variety and F is a regular rational inner function on [formula] with n-deg (V)  ≤  n-deg (F), then for every [formula] there exists a rational inner perturbation of F on V, Fε, such that Fε(z)  ≠  F(z).

We prove Theorem [\ref=ThmD] in Section 4. The following corollary of Theorem [\ref=ThmD] provides a partial answer to Agler and McCarthy's Question 4.14 in [\cite=agmc_dv]. Further results related to their question will appear in [\cite=dsQ].

Consider an extremal Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] and an inner variety V given as the zero set of a polynomial p. If there exists a regular rational inner function F solving the problem such that the degree of F is greater than or equal to the degree of p in each variable, then [formula].

Organization of the Paper

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we prove Theorem [\ref=FunctionSpace]. In section 3, we show that for each 1-dimensional inner variety V, there exists a Hilbert function space on [formula] the kernel for which is a Pick uniqueness kernel. In section 4 we prove Theorem [\ref=ThmB]. In section 5 we prove Theorem [\ref=ThmD]. In section 6, we prove Theorems [\ref=EachInner] and [\ref=kUniqueSet]. In section 7 we use Theorems [\ref=ThmB] and [\ref=ThmD] to construct a Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] for which the set of uniqueness equals the Neil Parabola.

I would like to thank Jim Agler for his generous help in discussing the ideas leading to this work and for his help in vastly improving the exposition of this paper. In particular, the idea for Lemma [\ref=InnerRank] was privately communicated to the author by Jim Agler and inspired much of this work.

Proof of Theorem 1.2

This section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem [\ref=FunctionSpace]. Accordingly, let H(X) be a Hilbert function space with kernel K and the property that for each finite set of points λ1,...,λN∈X and non-zero scalars a1,...,aN the complement of the zero set of G(x) = a1kλ1(x) + ... + aNkλN(x) is a set of uniqueness for Mult(H(X)). Fix a Nevanlinna-Pick problem with data λ1,...,λN∈X and [formula], let kij =  < kλj,kλi  >  . Let W and K denote the following N by N matrices

[formula]

Assume that W  ·  K = ((1 - ωij)kij) is singular and that φ1,φ2∈Mult1(H(X)) are solutions to the problem. We seek to show that φ1  =  φ2.

Let γ be a non-zero vector in the null space of W  ·  K, let λN + 1 be any point in X that is not one of the original nodes and let wN + 1 be a possible value that a solution to the original problem can take at λN + 1. Since the problem with data λ1,..,λN + 1 and ω1,...,ωN + 1 is solvable, Theorem 5.2 of [\cite=ampi] implies that the matrix N + 11 is positive semi-definite (one can check this by computing the operator 1 - MφM*φ on the span of {kλi}). Thus, for each [formula],

[formula]

Since γ is in the null-space of N1, inequality ([\ref=eqd6]) reduces to

[formula]

Since equation [\ref=eqd7] holds for all z, it follows that

[formula]

and the following gives an implicit formula for wN + 1,

[formula]

Define G∈H(X) with the formula

[formula]

Let Ω  ⊂  X be the complement of the zero set of G, i.e. the set of points λN + 1∈X on which both sides of formula [\ref=eqd799] do not vanish. On Ω, the value of wN + 1 is uniquely determined by the following formula,

[formula]

Thus, φ1  =  φ2 on Ω and the assumption that Ω is a set of uniqueness for Mult(H(X)) implies that φ1  =  φ2. [formula]

A Hilbert function space on V

In this section we prove the following theorem and two related results. The Schur Class of [formula], [formula], is the set of analytic functions that map [formula] to [formula], i.e. satisfy [formula].

Given a 1-dimensional irreducible inner variety [formula], there exists a finite measure μ on [formula] such that H2(μ), the closure of the polynomials in L2(μ), has the following properties. i. The set of kernel functions [formula] is dense in H2(μ). ii. The kernel associated to H2(μ) is a Pick uniqueness kernel. iii. For each [formula], if f is the restriction of F to [formula], then f∈Mult(H2(μ)) and ||Mf||  ≤  ||F||∞.

Theorem [\ref=measure] was inspired by a similar result for n = 2 in [\cite=agmc_dv].

Proof: Let p1,...,pr be irreducible polynomials such that [formula]. Let C be the projective closure of [formula] in [formula] and identify [formula] with a subset of C. Let (S,φ) be the desingularization of C, a compact Riemann surface S and a holomorphic function φ:S  →  C that is biholomorphic from S' onto C' and finite-to-one from [formula] onto [formula]. Here C' is the set of non-singular points in C, and S' is the preimage of C'. See e.g. [\cite=gh78] for details of the desingularization.

Let [formula]. Then ∂Ω is a finite union of disjoint curves, each of which is analytic except possibly at a finite number of cusps. Lemma 1.1 of [\cite=agmc_dv] states that there exists a finite measure ν on ∂Ω such that evaluation at every λ in Ω is a bounded linear functional on A2(ν), the closure in L2(ν) of A(Ω), the functions that are analytic on Ω and continuous on [formula]. Furthermore, the lemma states that the linear span of the corresponding evaluation kernels is dense in A2(ν).

The desired measure μ is the push-forward of ν by φ, normalized to have mass 1 on [formula]. In particular, μ is defined by

[formula]

If [formula] is a regular point of V, then there exists a unique ζ such that φ(ζ)  =  λ and [formula] is the reproducing kernel associated to ζ in A2(Ω). The function [formula] is defined μ almost everywhere on ∂V and for each [formula] satisfies

[formula]

If [formula] is a singular point of V, then there exist finitely many ζ1,...,ζs such that φ(ζi)  =  λ and the function

[formula]

is the corresponding reproducing kernel function for λ.

To see that the kernel associated to H2(μ) is a Pick uniqueness kernel fix points [formula], fix non-zero scalars [formula], fix the function G(x) = a1kλ1(x) + ... + aNkλN(x) and let [formula] be the complement of the zero set of G(x). That O is a set of uniqueness for Mult(H2(μ)) follows immediately from the following two observations.

1: [formula]. This holds since [formula]. 2: Each function [formula] that vanishes on an open [formula] vanishes on [formula]. This holds since the polynomials are dense in H2(μ) and if a polynomial p vanishes on [formula], then the function [formula] is analytic on Ω and vanishes on φ- 1(O) and thus, p vanishes on [formula].

To establish part iii. of the theorem, fix [formula] and let f be the restriction of F to [formula]. Since [formula], there exist polynomials {pi} that satisfy [formula] and approximate F on [formula] and in particular on [formula]. Thus, f∈H2(μ). The following calculation shows that ||Mf||  ≤  1. For each [formula] we have that [formula] [formula]

In Theorem [\ref=FredholmDegree] and Lemma [\ref=InnerRank] below, we establish two useful properties of H2(μ). To state them, we need some notation.

Given a polynomial q(z1,...,zn) with n-deg (q) = (d1,...,dn), let

[formula]

(Rudin [\cite=rud69]) Given a rational inner function F on [formula], there exist a polynomial q that does not vanish on [formula], an n-tuple of positive integers m = (m1,...,mn) and [formula] such that

[formula]

Furthermore, each rational function F of the form [\ref=InnerFormula] is inner.

For a Hilbert space H, a bounded linear operator A on H is a Fredholm operator if it has closed range, dim(Ker(A))  <    ∞   and dim(ker(A*))  <    ∞  . If A is a Fredholm operator, then the Fredholm index of A is defined to be ind(A)  =  dim(Ker(A)) - dim(Ker(A)). The following theorem summarizes the well known results that we will use.

. i. For A,B Fredholm operators on H, ind(AB) = ind(A) + ind(B). ii. The set of Fredholm operators, denoted F, is open in B(H). iii. As a function, [formula], is constant on connected components of F.

Given a 1-dimensional inner variety [formula] and a rational inner function F on [formula], for almost every [formula], the cardinality of the set [formula] constant. We define the degree of F on V by fixing one such [formula] and letting [formula]. We modify a proof from [\cite=agmc_dv] to establish the following result.

Consider a 1-dimensional inner variety [formula] with rank(V) = (m1,...,mn), H2(μ) the Hilbert function space from Theorem [\ref=measure], F a regular rational inner function with n-deg(F) = (d1,...,dn) and M*F the adjoint of the bounded linear operator of multiplication by F on H2(μ). Then,

[formula]

Proof: We first establish the following for each coordinate function zi,

[formula]

After an automorphism of [formula], we may assume that V has mi distinct non-singular points λi,1,...,λi,mi lying over the zero set of each coordinate zi. That deg V(zi) = mi is immediate. The operator of multiplication by zi, denoted Mzi, is an isometry with finite multiplicity and thus, Fredholm.

Let K = kernel(M*zi) and let Ki = span{kλi,1,...,kλi,mi}. Since kernel functions are eigenvectors of the adjoints of multiplication operators and satisfy [formula], we have that Ki  ⊂  K. Suppose towards a contradiction that [formula]. Choose [formula]. That g is orthogonal to Ki means that g vanishes at each of the points λi,1,...,λi,mi and that the function [formula] is in H2(μ). Thus, g equals [formula] and thus, [formula], a contradiction.

For a regular rational inner function [formula], normalize q so that q(0) = 1, let q(z) = 1 + Q(z) and for [formula] let

[formula]

For F0 = zd, the first part of the following equality is immediate and the second part follows from part i of Theorem [\ref=Fredholm].

[formula]

For each r between 0 and 1, Fr is a regular rational inner function and thus, [formula] implying that deg V(Fr) remains constant and M*Fr is a Fredholm operator meaning that part iii of Theorem [\ref=Fredholm] implies that ind(M*Fr) remains constant. [formula]

We can now prove another useful property of H2(μ).

Consider an irreducible 1-dimensional inner variety [formula], a rational inner function F on [formula] and H2(μ) the Hilbert function space on [formula] from Lemma [\ref=measure]. Let λ1,...,λN∈V be distinct, let ωi = F(λi) and let kij =  < kλj,kλi  >  . The rank of the N by N matrix [formula] is less than or equal to deg V(F).

Proof: Fix a measure μ on [formula], the existence of which is guaranteed by lemma [\ref=measure], and consider multiplication by F, denoted MF, as a bounded linear operator on H2(μ). The Pick matrix W  ·  K equals the grammian of the vectors {(1 - MFM*F)kλi}N1, i.e.

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The conclusion of the theorem follows from the following inequality,

[formula]

The first inequality in [\ref=rank] follows from the fact that the rank of the grammian of a set of vectors is less than or equal to the dimension of the span of the vectors. The second inequality in [\ref=rank] follows from the observation that range(1 - MFM*F) = kernel(M*F) and the equality dim(kernel(M*F)) =  deg V(F) from Theorem [\ref=FredholmDegree]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=ThmB]

Lemmas [\ref=measure] and [\ref=InnerRank] of the previous section readily imply Theorem [\ref=ThmB].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=ThmB]: Fix a 1-dimensional inner variety [formula], fix a regular rational inner function F on [formula], fix N >  deg V(F), fix distinct points [formula] and let ωi = F(λi). Suppose that [formula] satisfies G(λi) = F(λi) for each i = 1,...,N. We seek to show that G = F on [formula].

Let H2(μ) be the Hilbert function space from Lemma [\ref=measure]. Theorem [\ref=measure] states that the kernel associated with H is a Pick uniqueness kernel. Lemma [\ref=InnerRank] states the N by N Pick matrix W  ·  K corresponding to Nevanlinna-Pick problem with data λ1,..,λN and ω1,...,ωN has rank less than or equal to deg V(F) and is thus, singular. It follows that F is the unique solution to the problem in Mult1(H) and since G is another solution, we have that G = F in Mult(H2(μ)) and on [formula]. [formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=ThmD]

This section is dedicated to the proof of Theorem [\ref=ThmD]. Accordingly, let V be an inner variety and fix F a regular rational inner function on [formula] with n-deg (V)  ≤  n-deg (F). Let [formula], let s = n-deg (q), let p1,...,pk be irreducible polynomials such that [formula] and let ri = n-deg (pi).

For each pair of k-tuples of real numbers ε and δ define the function Fε,δ with the following formula,

[formula]

The assumption that F is regular means that q does not vanish on [formula] and thus, when the entries of ε and δ are sufficiently small, Theorem [\ref=Rudin] implies that the function Fε,δ is inner. The assumption that n-deg (V)  ≤  n-deg (F) implies that for each i we have that each entry of the n-tuple m + s - ri is non-negative and thus,

[formula]

Since V is inner, Proposition 2.6 of [\cite=ams06] implies for each i the polynomial [formula] vanishes on V and thus, [formula] on V.

To conclude the proof of the theorem, fix a [formula] and choose a ph such that [formula]. Fixing εh and letting each δi and each εi with i  ≠  h go to zero results in a function that satisfies Fε,δ(z)  ≠  F(z). [formula]

The case where [formula], the variety V = Zp is the zero set of a single polynomial p, and n-deg (p) = n-deg (F) is particularly simple. For ε sufficiently small, the function given by the following formula is a rational inner perturbation of F on V.

[formula]

Proof of Theorems [\ref=EachInner] and [\ref=kUniqueSet]

Theorems [\ref=ThmB] and [\ref=ThmD] readily imply Theorem [\ref=EachInner].

proof of Theorem [\ref=EachInner]: Fix a 1-dimensional inner variety V, let F be a regular rational inner function F on [formula] such that n -  deg (V)  ≤  n -  deg (F), let N >  deg V(F) and fix distinct points [formula]. By Theorem [\ref=ThmB], the set of uniqueness U for the Nevanlinna-Pick problem with data λ1,...,λN and F(λ1),...,F(λN) satisfies [formula]. For each [formula], Theorem [\ref=ThmD] guarantees the existence of an Fε that solves the problem and satisfies Fε(z)  ≠  F(z). Thus, [formula] and [formula]. [formula]

Theorem [\ref=ThmD] and Theorem 1.1 from [\cite=dsPLn] readily imply Theorem [\ref=kUniqueSet].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=kUniqueSet]: Fix [formula], k  ≤  n. Fix n regular rational inner functions m1,...,mn on [formula], non of which are constant in any the variables zi, and define the analytic mapping [formula] with the following formula

[formula]

It follows that [formula] and that there exists a k-dimensional inner variety V such that [formula]. Fix an analytic function F on [formula] such that n-deg (V)  ≤  n-deg (F). Identify the restriction of F to [formula] with a rational inner function f on [formula], f(z1,...,zk) = F(D(z1,...,zk)). Theorem 1.1 of [\cite=dsPLn] guarantees the existence of a Nevanlinna-Pick problem with data [formula] and f(λ1),...,f(λM) for which the solution is unique on [formula]. Consider the Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] with data D(λ1),...,D(λM)∈Dn and f(λ1),...,f(λM). If G is a solution to the new problem on [formula], then g(z1,...,zk) = G(D(z1,...,zk)) is a solution to the original problem on [formula] and thus, must equal f on [formula]. Thus, G = F on [formula] and it follows that V is a subset of the set of uniqueness for the problem on [formula], i.e. [formula]. Since n-deg (V)  ≤  n-deg (F), Theorem [\ref=ThmD] implies that [formula]. [formula]

The Neil Parabola

Let N denote the Neil Parabola, the zero set of the polynomial p = z3 - w2. Below, we use Theorems [\ref=ThmB] and [\ref=ThmD] can be used to construct a Nevanlinna-Pick problem on [formula] for which the set of uniqueness equals [formula].

Let F(z,w) = z3w2, let N > 12 =  deg N(F) and fix a Nevanlinna-Pick problem with data λ1,...,λN∈V and F(λ1),...,F(λN). Theorem [\ref=ThmB] states that all solutions to this problem agree on V, i.e. [formula]. Since n -  deg (N)  =  (3,2)  ≤  (3,2) = n -  deg (F), Theorem [\ref=ThmD] implies that [formula]. That [formula] also follows directly from the fact that for each ε < 1 / 2 the function Fε, given by the formula below, is a rational inner perturbation of F on V.

[formula]
