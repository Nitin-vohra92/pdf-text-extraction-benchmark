Introduction

Throughout this paper we work in the piecewise linear category. Let f be an embedding of a finite graph G into the 3-sphere. Then f is called a spatial embedding of G and f(G) is called a spatial graph. We denote the set of all spatial embeddings of G by SE(G). We call a subgraph of G which is homeomorphic to a circle a cycle of G, and a cycle of G which contains exactly k edges a k-cycle of G. For a positive integer n, Γ(n)(G) denotes the set of all cycles of G if n = 1 and the set of all unions of mutually disjoint n cycles of G if n  ≥  2. We denote the union of Γ(n)(G) over all positive integer n by (G). In the case of n = 1, we denote Γ(1)(G) by Γ(G) simply, and denote the subset of Γ(G) consisting of all k-cycles of G by Γk(G). For an element γ in Γ(n)(G) and an element f in SE(G), f(γ) is none other than a knot in f(G) if n = 1 and an n-component link in f(G) if n  ≥  2.

Let Kn be the complete graph on n vertices, namely the simple graph consisting of n vertices in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by exactly one edge. For spatial embeddings of K6 and K7, we recall the following, which are called the Conway-Gordon theorems.

(Conway-Gordon [\cite=CG83])

For any element f in SE(K6), it follows that

[formula]

where lk denotes the linking number in the 3-sphere.

For any element f in SE(K7), it follows that

[formula]

where Arf denotes the Arf invariant [\cite=Rober65].

Theorem [\ref=CG] implies that for any element f in SE(K6), there exists an element γ in Γ(2)(K6) such that lk(f(γ)) is odd, and for any element f in SE(K7), there exists an element γ in Γ7(K7) such that Arf(f(γ)) = 1. A graph is said to be intrinsically linked if for any element f in SE(G), there exists an element γ in Γ(2)(G) such that f(γ) is a nonsplittable 2-component link, and to be intrinsically knotted if for any element f in SE(G), there exists an element γ in Γ(G) such that f(γ) is a nontrivial knot. Theorem [\ref=CG] also implies that K6 is intrinsically linked and K7 is intrinsically knotted. Moreover, we can obtain another intrinsically linked (resp. knotted) graph from K6 (resp. K7) in the following way. A [formula]-exchange is an operation to obtain a new graph GY from a graph [formula] by removing all edges of a 3-cycle [formula] of [formula] with the edges uv,vw and wu, and adding a new vertex x and connecting it to each of the vertices u,v and w as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=Delta-Y] (we often denote [formula] by Y). A [formula]-exchange is the reverse of this operation. Throughout this paper, the symbols [formula] and x are used as in the sense of Fig. [\ref=Delta-Y]. Motwani-Raghunathan-Saran [\cite=MRS88] showed that if [formula] is intrinsically linked (resp. knotted) then GY is also intrinsically linked (resp. knotted). Thus any graph which is obtained from K6 (resp. K7) by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges is intrinsically linked (resp. knotted). The set of all graphs obtained from K6 (resp. K7) by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges consists of six (resp. fourteen) graphs as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=Petersen2] (resp. Fig. [\ref=Heawood2]).

Our purpose in this paper is to give a Conway-Gordon type theorem as Theorem [\ref=CG] (1) (resp. (2)) for any graph which is obtained from K6 (resp. K7) by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Let [formula] and GY be two graphs such that GY is obtained from [formula] by a single [formula]-exchange. We denote the set of all elements in [formula] containing [formula] by [formula]. Let γ' be an element in [formula] which does not contain [formula]. Then there exists an element (γ') in (GY) such that [formula]. It is easy to see that the correspondence from γ' to (γ') defines a surjective map

[formula]

Let A be an additive group. We say that an A-valued unoriented link invariant α is compressible if α(L) = 0 for any unoriented link L which have a component K bounding a disk D in the 3-sphere with [formula]. Namely α(L) = 0 if L contains a trivial knot as a split component. In particular α(L) = 0 when L is a trivial knot. Suppose that for each element γ' in [formula], an A-valued unoriented link invariant αγ' is assigned. Then for each element γ in (GY), we define an A-valued unoriented link invariant α̃γ by

[formula]

Then we have the following theorem.

Suppose that αγ' is compressible for each element γ' in [formula]. Suppose that there exists a fixed element c in A such that

[formula]

for any element g in [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

for any element f in SE(GY).

As an application of Theorem [\ref=main2], we have the following.

Let G be a graph which is obtained from K6 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Then there exist a map ω from Γ(G) to [formula] such that for any element f in SE(G), it follows that

[formula]

where ai denotes the ith coefficient of the Conway polynomial.

Let G be a graph which is obtained from K7 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Then there exists a map ω from (G) to [formula] such that for any element f in SE(G), it follows that

[formula]

As we will say later in Theorem [\ref=N_refine], Theorem [\ref=main] (1) and (2) has been already shown by the first author in the case G is K6 and K7, respectively [\cite=N09b]. Theorem [\ref=main] is shown by combining Theorem [\ref=main2] and Theorem [\ref=N_refine].

Note that the square of the linking number is congruent to the linking number modulo two, and the second coefficient of the Conway polynomial of a knot is congruent to the Arf invariant modulo two [\cite=Ka83]. Thus by taking the modulo two reduction in Theorem [\ref=main], we have the following corollary.

Let G be a graph which is obtained from K6 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Then, for any element f in SE(G), it follows that

[formula]

Let G be a graph which is obtained from K7 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Then there exists a map ω from Γ(G) to [formula] such that for any element f in SE(G), it follows that

[formula]

In other words, there exists a subset Γ of Γ(G) such that for any element f in SE(G), it follows that

[formula]

Note that Corollary [\ref=main_cor] (1) has already pointed out by Sachs [\cite=S84] and the second author-Yasuhara [\cite=TY01], but as far as the authors know, Corollary [\ref=main_cor] (2) has not been known yet except the case G is K7, see also Remark [\ref=comments].

The set of all graphs obtained from K6 by a finite sequence of [formula] and [formula]-exchanges is called the Petersen family. This family consists of six graphs of Fig. [\ref=Petersen2] and the complete tripartite graph K3,3,1 which cannot be obtained from K6 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges (K3,3,1 is obtained from P8 by a single [formula]-exchange at marked Y as illustrated in Fig. [\ref=Petersen2]). It is known that K3,3,1 is also intrinsically linked [\cite=S84] and it follows that

[formula]

for any element f in SE(K3,3,1) [\cite=TY01]. Recently O'Donnol showed in [\cite=D10] that there exist a map ω from Γ(K3,3,1) to [formula] such that

[formula]

for any element f in SE(K3,3,1). Namely, an integral version of the Conway-Gordon type theorem as Theorem [\ref=main] (1) holds for any graph in the Petersen family.

The set of all graphs which is obtained from K7 by a finite sequence of [formula] and [formula]-exchanges is called the Heawood family. This family consists of fourteen graphs of Fig. [\ref=Heawood2] and the other six graphs which cannot be obtained from K7 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. It is known that a graph in the Heawood family is intrinsically knotted if and only if the graph is obtained from K7 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges [\cite=HNTY10]. Namely, an integral version of the Conway-Gordon type theorem as Theorem [\ref=main] (2) holds for any graph in the Heawood family which is intrinsically knotted.

In the next section, we prove Theorem [\ref=main2]. In section 3, we prove Theorem [\ref=main].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main2]

Let f be a spatial embedding of GY and D a 2-disk in the 3-sphere such that [formula] and [formula]. Let φ(f) be a spatial embedding of [formula] such that φ(f)(x) = f(x) for [formula] and [formula]. Thus we obtain a map

[formula]

Then we immediately have the following.

Let f be an element in SE(GY) and γ an element in (GY). Then, f(γ) is ambient isotopic to φ(f)(γ') for each element γ' in the inverse image of γ by [formula]. [formula]

Suppose that for each element γ' in [formula], an A-valued unoriented link invariant αγ' is assigned. Then we have the following lemma.

If αγ' is compressible for any element γ' in [formula], then we have

[formula]

for any element f in SE(GY).

For an element γ' in [formula], we see that φ(f)(γ') is the trivial knot if γ' belongs to [formula] and a link containing a trivial knot as a split component if γ' belongs to [formula]. Since αγ' is compressible for any element γ' in [formula], we see that

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

Then, by Proposition [\ref=map], we see that

[formula]

Thus we have the result.

Suppose that there exists a fixed element c in A such that

[formula]

for any element g in [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma2a] and ([\ref=assume]), we have

[formula]

for any element f in SE(GY).

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main]

Let γ be an element in (GY). Then we see that the inverse image of γ by [formula] contains at most two elements in [formula], see Fig. [\ref=not_inj]. Moreover, we also see the following.

Let γ be an element in (GY). Then, the inverse image of γ by [formula] consists of exactly one element if and only if γ contains u,v,w and x, or γ does not contain x. [formula]

Note that if γ' is an element in [formula] then (γ') is an element in Γ(n)(GY). This implies that the restriction map of [formula] on [formula] induces a surjective map

[formula]

In particular, we denote Φ(1) by Φ simply. The surjectivity of Φ(n) implies that if [formula] is an empty set then Γ(n)(GY) is also an empty set for n  ≥  2. Since both Γ(n)(K6) and Γ(n)(K7) are the empty sets for n  ≥  3, we have the following.

Let G be a graph which is obtained from K6 or K7 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Then Γ(n)(G) is an empty set for n  ≥  3. [formula]

Now we prove Theorem [\ref=main]. First we recall a refinement of the Conway-Gordon theorems which was shown by the first author.

([\cite=N09b])

For any element f in SE(K6), it follows that

[formula]

For any element f in SE(K7), it follows that

[formula]

where Γ(2)k,l(K7) denotes the set of all unions of two disjoint cycles of K7 consisting of a k-cycle and an l-cycle. [formula]

Note that Theorem [\ref=CG] can be obtained from Theorem [\ref=N_refine] by taking the modulo two reduction.

First we show (1). We define a map ω from (K6) to [formula] by

[formula]

for an element γ' in (K6). Then by Theorem [\ref=N_refine] (1), it follows that

[formula]

for any element g in SE(K6). For each element γ' in (K6), we define an integer-valued unoriented link invariant αγ' of an unoriented link L as follows. If γ' is an element in Γ(K6), then αγ'(L) = 2ω(γ')a2(L) if L is a knot and 0 if L is not a knot. If γ' is an element in Γ(2)(K6), then αγ'(L) =  - ω(γ')a1(L)2 if L is a 2-component link and 0 if L is not a 2-component link. Note that a1(L)2  =  lk(L)2 if L is a 2-component link. Then by ([\ref=assump]), we have

[formula]

Let us consider the graph Q7 which is obtained from K6 by a single [formula]-exchange. Note that αγ' is compressible for any element γ' in (K6). Thus by Theorem [\ref=main2] and ([\ref=const_k6]), we have

[formula]

for any element f in SE(Q7). Now we define a map [formula] from (Q7) to [formula] by

[formula]

for an element γ in (Q7). Then we have

[formula]

for an element γ in Γ(Q7), and

[formula]

for any element γ in Γ(2)(Q7). Recall [formula] by Proposition [\ref=empty3]. Thus by combining ([\ref=const_q7]), ([\ref=omega]) and ([\ref=xi]), we have

[formula]

It can be checked directly that each union of mutually disjoint two cycles of a graph in the Petersen family contains all of the vertices of the graph. Thus the map

[formula]

is bijective by Proposition [\ref=injective] and therefore

[formula]

for any element γ in Γ(2)(Q7). Thus by ([\ref=a]) and ([\ref=b]), we have

[formula]

By repeating this argument, we have the desired conclusion.

Next we show (2). We define a map ω from (K7) to [formula] by

[formula]

for an element γ' in (K7). Then by Theorem [\ref=N_refine] (2), it follows that

[formula]

for any element g in SE(K7). For each element γ' in (K7), we define an integer-valued unoriented link invariant αγ' of an unoriented link L as follows. If γ' is an element in Γ(K7), then αγ'(L) = ω(γ')a2(L) if L is a knot and 0 if L is not a knot. If γ' is an element in Γ(2)(K7), then αγ'(L) =  - 2ω(γ')a1(L)2 if L is a 2-component link and 0 if L is not a 2-component link. Then by ([\ref=assump2]), we have

[formula]

Let us consider the graph H8 which is obtained from K7 by a single [formula]-exchange. Note also that αγ' is compressible for any element γ' in (K7). Thus by Theorem [\ref=main2] and ([\ref=const_k6]), we have

[formula]

for any element f in SE(H8). Now we define a map [formula] from (H8) to [formula] by

[formula]

for an element γ in (H8). Then we can see that

[formula]

for any element f in SE(H8) in the same way as the proof of (1). By repeating this argument, we have the desired conclusion.

Let [formula] be the map from (Q7) to [formula] as in ([\ref=c]). In the following, let us determine (γ) for each element γ in Γ(Q7). If γ is an element in Γ7(Q7), then there uniquely exists an element γ' in Γ6(K6) such that [formula]. Thus we have (γ) = ω(γ') = 1. If γ is an element in Γ6(Q7), we divide our situation into the following three cases. If γ does not contain x, then there uniquely exists an element γ' in Γ6(K6) such that [formula]. Thus we have (γ) = ω(γ') = 1. If γ contains x and does not contain u,v or w, then there exists an element γ'1 in Γ5(K6) and an element γ'2 in Γ6(K6) such that [formula]. Thus we have (γ) = ω(γ'1) + ω(γ'2) = 0. If γ contains u,v,w and x, then there uniquely exists an element γ' in Γ5(K6) such that [formula]. Thus we have (γ) = ω(γ') =  - 1. If γ is an element in Γ5(Q7), we divide our situation into the following two cases. If γ does not contain x, then there uniquely exists an element γ' in Γ5(K6) such that [formula]. Thus we have (γ) = ω(γ') =  - 1. If γ contains x, then note that γ does not contain u,v or w. Then there exists an element γ'1 in Γ4(K6) and an element γ'2 in Γ5(K6) such that [formula]. Thus we have (γ) = ω(γ'1) + ω(γ'2) =  - 1. Finally, if γ is an element in [formula], we have (γ) = 0. In conclusion, we see that

[formula]

for an element γ in Γ(Q7).

Let [formula] be the map from (H8) to [formula] as in ([\ref=c2]). Then we see that

[formula]

for an element γ in Γ(H8) in a similar way as in Example [\ref=ex1], and also see that

[formula]

for an element γ in Γ(2)(Q7). Now we denote the set

[formula]

by Γ. Then it follows that

[formula]

for any element f in SE(H8). We remark here that the restricted map of ΦK7,H8 on Γ7(K7) is a bijection from Γ7(K7) to Γ. On the other hand, the restricted map of [formula] on Γ7(K7) is not injective, see Figure [\ref=twice2].

Let G be a graph which is obtained from K7 by a finite sequence of [formula]-exchanges. Then by Corollary [\ref=main_cor] (2), for any element f in SE(G) there exists an element γ in Γ(G) such that Arf(f(γ)) = 1. This fact is also shown by applying Theorem [\ref=CG] (2) and Proposition [\ref=map] directly as follows. It is sufficient to show that if for any element g in [formula] there exists an element γ' in [formula] such that Arf(g(γ')) = 1, then for any element f in SE(GY) there exists an element γ in Γ(GY) such that Arf(f(γ)) = 1. Let f be an element in SE(GY). Then there exists an element γ' in [formula] such that Arf(φ(f)(γ')) = 1. Note that [formula] because [formula] is a trivial knot. Let γ be the image of γ' by Φ. Then we have Arf(f(γ)) = Arf(f(Φ(γ'))) = Arf(φ(f)(γ')) = 1. Corollary [\ref=main_cor] (2) insists on the result that is stronger than the fact above. Namely, there exists a subset Γ of Γ(G) which depends on only G such that the sum of the Arf invariants over all of the images of the elements in Γ by f is odd for any element f in SE(G).
