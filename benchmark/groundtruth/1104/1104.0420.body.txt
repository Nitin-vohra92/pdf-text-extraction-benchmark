On universal Baxter operator for classical groups

Introduction

Interactions between theory of quantum integrable systems and representation theory were intensive and mutually fruitful starting from the earlier studies of quantum integrable systems. Interpretation of the main technical tools used to solve quantum integrable systems in terms of representation theory was always a challenge promising not only a better understanding of the phenomena of quantum integrability but hopefully providing new methods in representation theory as well. One of the important results in the theory of quantum integrable systems is a construction of a class of operators introduced by Baxter [\cite=B]. The fundamental role playing by the Baxter operators in finding explicit solutions of quantum integrable systems becomes more and more obvious. However a representation theory interpretation of these operators is not quite satisfactory. Recently a progress in this direction was achieved for the Baxter operators associated with the quantum [formula]-Toda chains [\cite=GLO2]. Recall that the ring of [formula]-Toda chain quantum Hamiltonians can be identified with the center Z of the universal enveloping algebra [formula]. Common eigenfunctions of the quantum Hamiltonians are given by the [formula]-Whittaker functions identified with particular matrix elements of principle series representations of [formula]. In [\cite=GLO2] the integral Baxter operator for [formula]-Toda chain was introduced (see [\cite=PG] for analogous Baxter operators for affine [formula]-Toda chains). The integral Baxter operator is a one-parameter family of the integral operators such that the [formula]-Whittaker functions are their common eigenfunctions. Taking into account the representation theory interpretation of the quantum Hamiltonians as elements of the center [formula] it is natural to look for a similar representation theory interpretation of the Baxter operators for quantum [formula]-Toda chains. It was argued in [\cite=GLO2] that the natural representation theory framework for the Baxter operators is a theory of the spherical Hecke algebras [formula] where K is a maximal compact subgroup K of [formula]. Note that the Whittaker functions can be understood as functions on [formula] via matrix element interpretation mentioned above. Then the integral Baxter operator of [formula]-Toda chain arises via a convolution of an explicitly defined one-parameter family of elements of H with the [formula]-Whittaker functions. The kernels of the corresponding integral operators are given basically by the Gaussian K-biinvariant measures on [formula]. Such family of elements of the spherical Hecke algebra H was called the universal Baxter operator. A reason for this term is that such operator provides simultaneously a construction of the Baxter operators for a whole class of integrable systems associated with a pair [formula] (for example including along with [formula]-Toda chains also [formula]-Calogero-Sutherland systems). The surprising result of [\cite=GLO2] is that the eigenvalues of the universal Baxter operators acting on the [formula]-Whittaker functions corresponding to principle series representations V of [formula] are equal to local Archimedean L-factor attached to V via the local Archimedean Langlands correspondence. Such characterization of the local Archimedean L-factor is new and is in perfect correspondence with the analogous constructions over non-Archimedean fields.

In this short note we propose a construction of universal Baxter operator for classical series [formula] and [formula] generalizing results of [\cite=GLO2]. The construction of the universal Baxter operators (Theorem [\ref=Main]) essentially relies on the results of [\cite=PSR] on integral representations for local Archimedean L-factors associated with principle series representations of [formula] and [formula] (see [\cite=LR] for an extension to all classical series). We also show that some of the results of [\cite=PSR] can be easily rederived using the approach put forward in [\cite=GLO2]. Let us stress that the case of the classical groups other then [formula] reveals a new phenomena. In [\cite=GLO2] we argue that the Baxter integral operators are a close cousins of the recursive operators for the Whittaker functions. Recursive operators for all classical series of finite Lie groups were constructed in [\cite=GLO1] and for classical groups other then [formula] their integral kernels are given by non-trivial integral expressions. One should expect that a similar phenomena takes place for the universal Baxter elements of the Hecke algebra H(G,K) for G being classical groups other then [formula]. An explicit form of the integral kernel given in Theorem [\ref=Main] confirm these expectations. Detailed discussion of the proposed construction of the universal Baxter operators for all classical Lie groups including a derivation of explicit integral expressions for the Baxter operators acting on Whittaker functions will appear elsewhere [\cite=GLO3].

Baxter operator and spherical Hecke algebras

In this Section we review two particular classes of integral representations of [formula]-Whittaker functions. Let Eij, [formula] be the standard basis of the Lie algebra [formula]. Let [formula] be a center of the universal enveloping algebra [formula]. Let [formula] be upper-triangular and lower-triangular Borel subgroups and N±  ⊂  B± be upper-triangular and lower-triangular unipotent subgroups. Denote by [formula] and [formula] their Lie algebras. Let [formula] be a diagonal Cartan subalgebra and [formula] be the Weyl group of [formula]. Using the Harish-Chandra isomorphism of [formula] with [formula]-invariant subalgebra of the symmetric algebra [formula] we identify central characters with homomorphisms [formula]. Let [formula], [formula] be a family of principal series representations of [formula] induced from one-dimensional representations [formula] of [formula]. Here [formula] and [formula]. Denote 〈  ,  〉 a pairing on [formula]. We suppose that the action of the Cartan subalgebra [formula] in representation [formula] can be integrated to an action of the corresponding Cartan subgroup [formula].

The [formula]-Whittaker function can be defined as a matrix element of a principle series representation [formula] of [formula] (see e.g. [\cite=J], [\cite=Ha]). Let us fix the Iwasawa decomposition G = N-AK -  where K is a maximal compact subgroup of G, A be a group of diagonal matrices with the positive elements and N- is a maximal unipotent subgroup of lower-triangular matrices with unites on the diagonal. Let ρ(g) be given by ρ(nak) = 〈ρ, log a〉 where k∈K, a∈A and n∈N-. Let φK be a spherical vector in [formula] and ψN- be the Whittaker vector defined by the condition

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula]. Then the Whittaker function on G is defined as a matrix element

[formula]

The function [\eqref=Wf] satisfies the obvious functional equation

[formula]

and descends to a function on the space A of the diagonal matrices [formula].

Standard considerations (see e.g. [\cite=STS]) show that the matrix element [\eqref=Wf] is a common eigenfunction of a family of commuting differential operators descending from generators of [formula] acting in [formula]. These differential operators can be identified with quantum Hamiltonians of [formula]-Toda chain. For example the simplest non-trivial quantum Hamiltonian acts on the Whittaker function via the differential operator

[formula]

Using explicit realizations of the universal enveloping algebra representation [formula] via difference/ differential operators acting in an appropriate space of functions the matrix element representation [\eqref=Wf] leads to various integral representations of the Whittaker function.

As it was demonstrated in [\cite=GLO2] the [formula]-Whittaker function being a common eigenfunction of a family of mutually commuting differential operators is also a common eigenfunction of a one-parameter family of integral operators. These integral operators were called the Baxter operators due to their relation with the Baxter operators in the theory of quantum integrable systems.

Define the Baxter Q-operator as an integral operator acting in an appropriate space of functions of [formula] variables with the integral kernel

[formula]

where [formula] , with [formula].

The operator [formula] satisfies the following commutativity relations:

[formula]

[formula]

where [formula] are quantum Hamiltonians of [formula]-Toda chain.

With respect to [formula] the [formula]-Whittaker function [\eqref=Wf] has the following eigenfunction identity:

[formula]

where

[formula]

We use the following notations [formula], [formula], [formula] and the eigenvalue in [\eqref=eigenprop] is given by

[formula]

The eigenvalue [\eqref=lAL] is a local Archimedean L-factor associated with principle series representation [formula].

The appearance of the local Archimedean L-factors in [\eqref=eigenprop] is not accidental and is related with the fact that the integral operators [\eqref=Baxter] are realizations of particular elements of the local spherical Archimedean Hecke algebra (see [\cite=GLO2] for detailed discussion). Recall that the Archimedean Hecke algebra [formula], K being a maximal compact subgroup of [formula] is defined as an algebra of K-biinvariant functions on [formula], φ(g) = φ(k1gk2), k1,k2∈K acting by a convolution

[formula]

where the last equality holds for unimodular groups. To ensure the convergence of the integrals [\eqref=con5] we imply that the elements of spherical Hecke algebra belong to the Schwarz functional space i.e. the functions such all their derivatives decrease at infinity faster then inverse power of any polynomial. Spherical Hecke algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of [formula]-invariant functions on [formula] where [formula] is a complex Lie group dual to G (e.g. [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] are dual to [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] respectively). Given a finite-dimensional representation [formula] one attaches a local Archimedean L-function corresponding to a spherical irreducible representation of G as follows (see e.g. [\cite=Bu], [\cite=L]):

[formula]

where [formula] and t∞ is a conjugacy class in the Lie algebra [formula]. In the case of [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] we recover [\eqref=lAL].

By the multiplicity one theorem [\cite=Sha], there is a unique smooth K-spherical vector φK in a principal series irreducible representation [formula]. The action of a K-biinvariant function φ on the spherical vector φK in [formula] is given by the multiplication by a character Λφ of the Hecke algebra H:

[formula]

In particular, the elements φ of the Hecke algebra act via convolution on the Whittaker function [\eqref=newW] as follows:

[formula]

Here the Whittaker function [formula] is considered as a function on G such that

[formula]

where χN-(n) is a character of N- trivial on

[formula]

φ(k g   k)=φ(g),  φ(e)=1,   g∈ G,   k,k∈ K.

[formula]

φ*φ(g)=  Λ(λ)  φ(g),

[formula]

Q(g,s)=* Q(g,s),  Q(g,s)= |det g| e,   (g,s)=Q(g,s).

[formula]

Universal Baxter operator for classical groups [formula] and [formula]

In this Section we propose a generalization of Theorem [\ref=MainTh1] to the case of the maximal split forms of the classical series [formula] and [formula]. Note that the resulting expressions for analogs of [\eqref=UBO] are not as simple as in the case of general linear groups and are given by non-trivial integrals.

Let us first recall a particular realization of classical Lie groups [formula] and [formula] as subgroups of the general linear group [formula]. We are interested in realizations of standard representations [formula] of the Lie algebras [formula] such that the Weyl generators corresponding to the Borel (Cartan) subalgebras of [formula] are realized by upper triangular (diagonal) matrices (see e.g. [\cite=DS]). The corresponding group embedding [formula], [formula] can be defined as follows. Consider the following involution on [formula] (identified with a subspace of [formula]-matrices):

[formula]

where a  →  at is induced by the standard matrix transposition,

[formula]

and [formula]. The symplectic group [formula] then can be defined as the following subgroup of [formula]:

[formula]

Similarly in the case of [formula] consider the involution on [formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

and [formula]. The orthogonal group [formula] can be defined as the following subgroup of [formula]:

[formula]

The maximal compact subgroup of [formula] embedded this way is given by an intersection of G with the maximal compact subgroup of [formula].

We would like to construct elements of Hecke algebra H(G,K), where G are maximal split forms of [formula], [formula] and K  ⊂  G is a maximal compact subgroup, such that their actions on spherical vectors in spherical principle series representations are given by multiplications on the corresponding local Archimedean L-factors associated with the standard representations of the dual Lie groups. Recall that [formula] is self-dual and [formula] is dual to [formula]. The corresponding local L-factors are given by

[formula]

[formula]

where we parameterize the weights of the corresponding principle series representations via elements of the dual Lie algebras by taking [formula] for an element of the Lie algebra [formula] and similarly [formula] for an element of the Lie algebra [formula]. Here we also use the modified Γ-function:

[formula]

The following Theorem is a simple reformulation of the result obtained in [\cite=PSR].

Proof. Let [formula] be a normalized spherical function on G corresponding to the principle series representation [formula]. According to [\cite=PSR] (see e.g. p. 37) the following integral representations for Archimedean L-factors [\eqref=SO], [\eqref=SP] holds

[formula]

where QG(g,s) is given by [\eqref=UBOa]. Now using [\eqref=conS] and [\eqref=Lfactor] we obtain [\eqref=conS1]. [formula]

As a simple illustration of the above results let us provide explicit calculations for [formula]. The maximal split form of SO2 can be embedded in [formula] via diagonal matrices. Thus the connected component of the unity can be parametrized as follows:

[formula]

This is in agreement with [\eqref=SOemb] with S = diag(1,1). The normalized spherical function is given by

[formula]

Specialization of [\eqref=formula] to G = SO2 gives

[formula]

To calculate the integral let us denote X2 = gtg + 1 = diag(X21,X22) and X21 = e2t + 1, X22 = e- 2t + 1. Then we have

[formula]

Using the change of variables Zij  →  ZijX- 1i we obtain

[formula]

Thus we have

[formula]

Now we would like to calculate the integral

[formula]

where prefactor 2 takes into account sum over connected components of the split form of SO(2). Taking into account [\eqref=i11] and using the Euler integral representation for the Gamma-function we have ( assuming Ims < 0)

[formula]

[formula]

One can directly calculate the action on SO2-Whittaker functions

[formula]

We have

[formula]

This completes explicit verification of the statement of Theorem [\ref=Main] for G = SO2.
