Abstract: The Multivariate Extreme Value distributions have shown their usefulness in environmental studies, financial and insurance mathematics. The Logistic or Gumbel-Hougaard distribution is one of the oldest multivariate extreme value models and it has been extended to asymmetric models. In this paper we introduce generalized logistic multivariate distributions. Our tools are mixtures of copulas and stable mixing variables, extending approaches in Tawn (1990), Joe and Hu (1996) and Fougères et al. (2009). The parametric family of multivariate extreme value distributions considered presents a flexible dependence structure and we compute for it the multivariate tail dependence coefficients considered in Li (2009).

Keywords: Multivariate extreme value distribution, tail dependence, logistic model, mixture.

The model

Let [formula] denotes the conditional distribution of a random variable or vector Z given another random variable or vector W. For the vectors [formula], j = 1,...,q, and [formula], defined on the same probability space, we shall assume that:

(a) [formula],

(b)[formula]

(c) [formula], xj > 0, j = 1,...,d, where Cj's are max-stable copulas and {βji,j = 1,...,q,i = 1,...,d} are non-negative constants such that [formula], i = 1,...,d,

(d) [formula], t  ≥  0, j = 1,...,q, where αj's are constants in (0,1]

and

(e) [formula].

Thus every Xji is a scale mixture with mixing variable βjiSαjj and [formula], j = 1,...,q, are conditionally independent given [formula]. Scale mixtures have been studied and used in a variety of applications ( Marshall and Olkin (1988, [\cite=marshall+olkin]), Joe and Hu (1996, [\cite=joe+hu]) and Fougères et al. (2009, [\cite=fougeres+nolan+rootzen]), Li (2009, [\cite=li])).

We shall consider here a componentwise maxima model from the [formula]'s. From this model we derive a new family of copulas and analize its orthant tail dependence by computing the multivariate tail dependence coefficients considered in Li (2009, [\cite=li])). Finally we apply the results to the particular case of Cj being the copula arising from the distribution of the variables in a M4 process (Smith and Weissman, 1996, [\cite=smith+weissman]).

Proof. To obtain [formula] we just apply the conditional independence of the [formula]'s follwoed by the max-stability of Cj's and the αj-stability of each Sj, as follows:

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

For each j and i, Xji is a positive αj-stable size mixture of a Frechet distribution with location βji, scale βjiαj and shape parameter αj and has itself Frechet distribution with same location and the same right end point, but scale βji and shape parameter 1. Since [formula], i = 1,...,d, each Yi has unit Frechet distribution. The max-stability of [formula] follows from its expression and the max-stability of the Cj's. [formula]

We now discuss some particular cases of ([\ref=modelo]) that has been explored.

(I) If q = 1 then β1i = 1, i = 1,...d, and

[formula]

is a generalisation of the Archimedean copula (Joe, 1997, [\cite=joe]), which for the particular case of the product copula C1  =  Π leads to the Gumbel-Hougaard or logistic copula. The dependence properties of the special case of [formula], where C{s,t}, 1  ≤  s < t  ≤  d, are bivariate copulas and (d - 1)pi + piνi = 1, i = 1,...,d, were analysed in Joe and Hu (1996, [\cite=joe+hu]).

(II) If Cj  =  Π, j = 1,...,q, then

[formula]

which leads to an asymmetric logistic copula

[formula]

In ([\ref=modelo1]), if we take αj  =  α, j = 1,...,q  ≤    +    ∞  , we find an analogous mixture of extreme value distributions to those considered in Fougeres et al (2009, [\cite=fougeres+nolan+rootzen]) by departing just from a random vector [formula] satisfying [formula] and [formula], i = 1,...,d. That this, in this different approach, conditionally on [formula], the vector [formula] has independent margins and each margin is a power mixture of an extreme value distribution with mixing variable [formula], where the cji are non-negartive constants.

(III) Assume now, in ([\ref=modelo1]), that each j corresponds to an element A of the set S, the class of all nonempty subsets of D = {1,...,d}. If βAi = 0 for each [formula] then the copula ([\ref=modelo1]) becomes

[formula]

with [formula], i = 1,...,d. This is the asymmetric logistic model considered in Tawn (1990, [\cite=tawn]), by following a different probabilistic approach. More generally, by applying the same interpretation of the constants βji in ([\ref=modelo]), we obtain

[formula]

where CA's are copulas with different dimensions and we denote by [formula] the sub-vector of (1,...,d) corresponding to indices in A. In particular, if we begin with one copula Cj = C, j = 1,...,q, then CA, A  ⊂  S, are all the sub-copulas of C.

(IV) Finally, let us suppose that βji  =  βj, i = 1,...,d, in ([\ref=modelo]). Then

[formula]

with [formula], that is, [formula] is a geometric mean of mixtures of powers of multivariate extreme value distributions. The particular case of the weighted geometric mean [formula] is due to Cuadras and Augé (1981, [\cite=cuadras+auge]).

Orthant tail dependence

For a random vector [formula] with continuos margins F1,...,Fd and copula C, let the bivariate (upper) tail dependence parameters defined by

[formula]

The tail dependence is a copula based measure and it holds

[formula]

where C{s,t} is the copula of the sub-vector [formula] ( Joe (1997, [\cite=joe]), Nelsen (1999, [\cite=nelsen])).

To characterise the relative strength of extremal dependence with respect to a particular subset of random variables of [formula] one can use conditional orthant tail probabilities of [formula] given that the components with indices in the subset J are extreme. The tail dependence of bivariate copulas can be extended as done in Schmid and Schmidt (2007) ([\cite=schmid/schmidt]) and Li (2009) ([\cite=li]).

For [formula], let

[formula]

If for some [formula] the parameter [formula] exists and is positive then we say that [formula] is (upper) orthant tail dependent.

We have [formula], if [formula] and the relation ([\ref=1]) between the tail dependence parameter and the bivariate copula can also be generalized by

[formula]

where CA denotes the sub-copula of C corresponding to margins with indices in A and and [formula] the |A|-dimensional vector (u,...,u). By applying this relation and the max-stability of the copulas Cj, we get the following result.

The tail dependence result in ([\ref=lambda1]) depends on the mixing variables through the parameters αj, even for the case of q = 1, that is the global dependence added by the mixing variables doesn't vanish in extremes of maxima. This contrast with the result in Li (2009, [\cite=li]), where the scale mixture of MEV distributions (RX1,...,RXd) is considered with the mixing variable R satisfying [formula], as t tends to ∞  , and c  ≥  1, α > 0. In this case the upper tail dependence parameters are exactly the same as the parameters of the MEV distribution without mixing.

We remark that, for βji  =  βj, i = 1,...,d, the numerator in ([\ref=lambda1]) is, for each A  ⊂  D,

[formula]

that is, the tail dependence parameter [formula] is a linear convex combination of the corresponding tail dependence parameters for the sub-copulas Cj,A of Cj, j = 1,...,q.

The result in ([\ref=lambda2]) leads to

[formula]

extending the the known result

[formula]

corresponding to q = 1 (Joe (1997, [\cite=joe]), Nelsen (1999, [\cite=nelsen])). The result in ([\ref=lambda1]) enables to extend the equation ([\ref=lambda3]) for other copulae C1 than the product copula as

[formula]

Example

We will suppose that Cj = C, j = 1,...,d, with

[formula]

where {alkj,l  ≥  1,  -    ∞   < k <   ∞  ,1  ≤  j  ≤  d}, are nonnegative constants satisfying

[formula]

That copula arises from the common distribution of the variables of an M4 process (Smith and Weissman (1996, [\cite=smith+weissman])).

Then the copula in ([\ref=modelo]) becomes

[formula]

By applying the result in Proposition 2.1. (a), we obtain for the numerator in ([\ref=lambda1])

[formula]

For the bivariate tail dependence it holds

[formula]

which, for the case q = 1 leads to the result [formula] in Heffernan et al. (2007, [\cite=hef+]).
