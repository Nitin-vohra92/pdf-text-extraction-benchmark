Congruences for Broken k-Diamond Partitions

Introduction and Statement of Results

In [\cite=AndrewsPaule], Paule and Andrews constructed a class of directed graphs called broken k-diamonds, and they used them to define Δk(n) to be the number of broken k-diamond partitions of n. They noted that the generating function for Δk(n) is essentially a modular form. More precisely, if k  ≥  1, then

[formula]

where η(z) is Dedekind's eta function

[formula]

One can show various congruences for Δk(n) for n in certain arithmetic progressions. For example, Xiong [\cite=Xiong] proved congruences for Δ3(n) and Δ5(n) which had been conjectured by Paule and Radu in [\cite=PauleRadu]. In particular, he showed that

[formula]

In this note, we prove the remaining two conjectures in [\cite=PauleRadu]. First, we use [\eqref=conj1] to prove the following statement (which is denoted Conjecture 3.2 in [\cite=PauleRadu]).

For all [formula] we have that

[formula]

Now, recall that the weight k Eisenstein series (where k  ≥  4 is even) are given by

[formula]

where Bk is the kth Bernoulli number, and [formula] Also define

[formula]

The coefficients c(n) are of interest here because they are related to broken k-diamond partitions in the following way (as conjectured in [\cite=PauleRadu] and proved in [\cite=Xiong]):

[formula]

Here we prove the last remaining conjecture of Paule and Radu (which is Conjecture 3.4 of [\cite=PauleRadu]). More precisely, we have the following theorem.

For every prime [formula] there exists an integer y(p) such that

[formula]

for all [formula]

Theorem [\ref=cor] follows from a more technical result (see Theorem [\ref=thm] which is proved in Section [\ref=prf]).

As noted in [\cite=PauleRadu], one can combine [\eqref=conj3] with Theorem [\ref=cor] to see that for every prime [formula] and [formula] we have

[formula]

To prove Theorems [\ref=conj2] and [\ref=cor], we make use of the theory of modular forms. In particular, we shall make use of the U-operator, Hecke operators, the theory of twists, and a theorem of Sturm. These results are described in [\cite=Ono]. We shall freely assume standard definitions and notation which may be found there.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=conj2]

First we consider the form η(3z)4η(6z)6. By Theorems 1.64 and 1.65 in [\cite=Ono], we have that [formula] Note from [\eqref=conj1] that

[formula]

It follows that

[formula]

Here, Ud denotes Atkin's U-operator, which is defined by

[formula]

for d a positive integer. By the theory of the U-operator (see Proposition 2.22 in [\cite=Ono]), it follows that [formula] Now if we define b(n) by

[formula]

then our goal is to show that

[formula]

In order to prove the desired congruence, consider the Dirichlet character ψ defined by [formula] we may consider the ψ-twist of f, which is given by

[formula]

By Proposition 2.8 of [\cite=Ono], we have that [formula]

Then consider

[formula]

In fact, [formula] This follows from a theorem of Sturm (see Theorem 2.58 in [\cite=Ono]), which states that [formula] if its first 23520 coefficients are 0 (mod 7) (which can be checked using a computer). Thus we have that

[formula]

for all n, and thus

[formula]

for all [formula] as desired.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=cor]

Preliminaries

Let us first recall the Hecke operators and their properties. If [formula] and p is prime, the Hecke operator Tp,k,χ (or simply Tp if the weight and character are known from context) is defined by

[formula]

where we set a(n / p) = 0 if [formula] It is important to note that f(z)|Tp∈Mk(Γ0(N),χ).

In order to prove the final statement of Theorem [\ref=cor], define

[formula]

and note that c(n)  =  b(2n + 1). Thus we wish to show that for every prime [formula] there exists an integer y(p) such that

[formula]

for all [formula] By summing (and noting that b(n) = 0 when n is even) we see that this is equivalent to the statement that

[formula]

That is, we need only show that g(z) is an eigenform of the Hecke operator Tp for all [formula]

To see this, we let F be the weight 2 Eisenstein series given by

[formula]

let θ0(z) be the theta-function given by

[formula]

and let h(z) be the normalized cusp form

[formula]

Then h(z) is a modular form with complex multiplication (see Section 1.2.2 of [\cite=Ono]), and for prime p we have

[formula]

Then we may define [formula] by

[formula]

We prove the following theorem involving these forms.

The forms f(z) and [formula] are eigenforms of the Hecke operator Tp for all primes p. Furthermore we have that

[formula]

where [formula] is the subspace of [formula] spanned by g together with g|Tp for all primes p.

First note that f and [formula] are eigenforms of the Hecke operator Tp for all primes p. To see this, note that there is a basis of Hecke eigenforms of the space [formula]. Also, both f and [formula] are eigenforms of T5 with eigenvalue 258, one can compute that this eigenspace

[formula]

is 2-dimensional. Finally, both f and [formula] are eigenforms of the Hecke operator T7, and they have different eigenvalues.

Now, note that

[formula]

and thus [formula] is a two-dimensional subspace of [formula] Thus [formula] as desired.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=cor]

Suppose p is a prime with [formula] Then we need only check that f and [formula] are eigenforms of Tp with the same eigenvalue. Since these eigenvalues are the coefficients of qp in the expansions of f and [formula], we need only show that

[formula]

i.e., [formula].

Now, note that d2(p) = 0 since the coefficients of f2 are only supported on indices that are congruent to 3 mod 4 by the descriptions of E4(4z),F(2z), and h(z) given above. Thus [formula] as desired.
