On the geometry of small weight codewords of dual algebraic geometric codes

Introduction

In the recent contribution [\cite=Pellegrini], the number of small weight codewords for some families of Hermitian codes is determined. Besides explicit computation, the main ingredient in [\cite=Pellegrini] is a nice geometric characterization of the points in the support of a minimum weight codeword, which turn out to be collinear (see Corollary 1 and Proposition 2 in [\cite=Pellegrini]).

Here we show that such a property is not peculiar to Hermitian codes, but it holds in full generality for dual algebraic geometric codes on any smooth complete intersection projective variety of arbitrary dimension. Namely, by exploiting the algebro-geometric tools provided by [\cite=C], we prove the following:

Let [formula], r  ≥  2, be a smooth connected complete intersection defined over [formula]. Let G be a divisor on X such that [formula]. Let [formula] be distinct rational points on X avoiding the support of G and let [formula]. Let d be the minimum distance of the code C(D,G)* and let [formula] be the points in the support of a minimum weight codeword.

If d  ≤  m + 2, then d  =  m + 2 and all the m + 2 points Pij are collinear in [formula].

If d  ≤  2m + 2 and no m + 2 of the Pij's are collinear, then d  =  2m + 2 and all the 2m + 2 points Pij lie on a plane conic.

If d  ≤  3m, no m + 2 of the Pij's are collinear and no 2m + 2 of them lie on a plane conic, then d  =  3m and all the 3m points Pij lie at the intersection of two complanar plane curves of respective degrees 3 and m.

If we focus on the explicit interesting example of Hermitian codes (as presented for instance in [\cite=Pellik]), then our general result specializes as follows:

Let [formula] be the Hermitian curve of affine equation xq + 1 = yq + y defined over [formula]. Let G  =  Pρ0, where P0 is the point at infinity, [formula] with n = q3, and let C(D,G)* be the Hermitian code. Let d be the minimum distance and let [formula] be the points in the support of a minimum weight codeword.

If 0  ≤  ρ  ≤  q2 - q - 2, then all the points Pij are collinear.

If ρ  ≥  q2 - q - 2, then the following holds.

If d  ≤  q, then all the points Pij are collinear.

If d  ≤  2q - 2, then either q of the points Pij are collinear, or all the points Pij lie on a plane conic.

If d  ≤  3q - 6, then either q of the points Pij are collinear, or 2q - 2 of the points Pij lie on a plane conic, or all the points Pij lie at the intersection of two complanar plane curves of respective degrees 3 and q - 2.

If ρ  ≥  q2 - 1, then the following holds.

If d  ≤  q + 1, then all the points Pij are collinear.

If d  ≤  2q, then either q + 1 of the points Pij are collinear, or all the points Pij lie on a plane conic.

If d  ≤  3q - 3, then either q + 1 of the points Pij are collinear, or 2q of the points Pij lie on a plane conic, or all the points Pij lie at the intersection of two complanar plane curves of respective degrees 3 and q - 1.

In the case of Hermitian codes we may even describe the geometry of small, even not minimum, weight codewords (notice that our technical assumption [formula] is satisfied by the so-called corner codes according to the terminology of [\cite=Pellegrini], Definition 2):

Let [formula] be the Hermitian curve of affine equation xq + 1 = yq + y defined over [formula]. Let G  =  Pρ0, where P0 is the point at infinity, [formula] with n = q3, and let C(D,G)* be the Hermitian code. If 0  ≤  ρ  ≤  q2 - q - 2 and [formula], then at least d - 1 of the points [formula] in the support of a codeword of weight d + a, where 0  ≤  a  ≤  d - 3, are collinear.

In the next future, the second named author is going to apply the above geometric characterization to compute the number of small weight codewords for Hermitian corner codes, in the spirit of [\cite=Pellegrini]. Indeed, the present research is part of her PhD program, supervised by Massimiliano Sala. Both authors are grateful to him for strongly stimulating this joint project. The first named author has been partially supported by GNSAGA of INdAM and MIUR Cofin 2008 - Geometria delle varietà algebriche e dei loro spazi di moduli (Italy).

The proofs

Proof of Theorem [\ref=general]. Let c∈C(D,G)* be a minimum weight codeword having support [formula] with s = d. By the definition of a dual code, we have

[formula]

for every [formula]. In particular, we have

[formula]

for every [formula]. Hence [formula] turn out to be linearly dependent in [formula] and, in the terminology of [\cite=C], Definition 2.4 and Definition 2.8, [formula] are m-linked. Now, we have d = s = m + 2 in case (i) by [\cite=C], Proposition 6.1, d = s = 2m + 2 in case (ii) by [\cite=C], Proposition 7.2, and d = s = 3m in case (iii) by [\cite=C], Proposition 8.1. Finally, we complete case (i) by [\cite=C], Proposition 6.2, case (ii) by [\cite=C], Proposition 7.4, and case (iii) by [\cite=C], Proposition 9.1.

Proof of Corollary [\ref=distance]. Since L(G) = 〈{xiyj:i  ≥  0,0  ≤  j  ≤  q - 1,iq + j(q + 1)  ≤  ρ}〉 and [formula] can be identified with the set of polynomials in r variables of degree at most k, it is easy to check that [formula] for every k  ≥  0 such that k  ≤  q - 1 and k(q + 1)  ≤  ρ. If 0  ≤  ρ  ≤  q2 - q - 2, then let m: = d - 2. By [\cite=Pellik], § 5.3, we have ρ = 2q2 - q - uq - v - 1 with 1  ≤  u,v  ≤  q - 1 and d = (q - u)q - v if u  <  v, d = (q - u)q if u  ≥  v. Hence d = m + 2 implies m  =  u - 1 for u  >  v and m  =  u for u = v, hence

[formula]

If ρ  ≥  q2 - q - 2 let m: = q - 2, if instead ρ  ≥  q2 - 1 let m: = q - 1. In both cases ([\ref=enough]) is satisfied, implying [formula]. Now our claim follows from Theorem [\ref=general].

Proof of Proposition [\ref=almostminimalweight]. If cj are the non-zero components of the corresponding codeword, then

[formula]

for every [formula], in particular [formula] are (d - 2)-linked.

If they are not minimally (d - 2)-linked, then (up to reordering) we have

[formula]

for every [formula]. Our assumption [formula] implies that the bj's are the components of a codeword of weight strictly less than d + a. By induction on a starting from Corollary [\ref=distance] we conclude that at least d - 1 of them are collinear.

Assume now that the points [formula] are minimally (d - 2)-linked. If they are not collinear, there exists a hyperplane H containing exactly l of them, with 2  ≤  l  ≤  d + a - 1. By [\cite=C], Lemma 5.1, the remaining d + a - l points are (minimally) (d - 3)-linked and from [\cite=C], Proposition 7.2, it follows that at least (d - 1) of them are collinear since by our numerical assumption on a we have d + a - l  ≤  2(d - 3) + 1.
