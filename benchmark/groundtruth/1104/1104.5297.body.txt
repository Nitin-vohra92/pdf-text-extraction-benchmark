The equalization probability of the Pólya urn

An urn contains b black and w white balls, where b > w. A ball is drawn from the urn at random, and then replaced with two balls of the same color. This same procedure is then repeated indefinitely. What is the probability that the urn ever contains the same number of black and white balls?

The problem involves the famous Pólya urn [\cite=Eggenberger:1923kv] [\cite=Polya:1930wp] [\cite=johnson_urn_1977] [\cite=mahmoud_polya_2008]. The solution is not obvious, because the probability of a black or white draw is constantly changing, and an infinite number of different draw sequences can lead to equalization. The purpose of this note is to show that there is a remarkably simple solution: the equalization probability is just twice the probability that in b + w - 1 tosses of a fair coin, no more than w - 1 will be heads.

A probabilist would solve this problem by noting that the draws of the Pólya urn are exchangeable, in the sense that the probability of drawing any finite sequence of black and white balls depends only on the total number of black balls, and not on the order in which they are drawn. She would then invoke de Finetti's theorem, which states that an exchangeable process is a mixture of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) processes, which in this case means Bernoulli processes, or biased random walks [\cite=kallenberg_foundations_2010] [\cite=aldous_ecole_1985] [\cite=feller_introduction_1971]. In this way, she would reduce the equalization problem for the Pólya urn to the gambler's ruin problem, whose well-known solution dates to the inception of probability theory [\cite=feller_introduction_1968]. Such an approach is not without its charms, and also leads to efficient solutions of more difficult problems, such as the probability that there are ever k more white than black balls. However, it depends on the gambler's ruin results, and it seems worthwhile, if possible, to prove the result directly.

In this note, I provide an elementary proof of the main result, which does not depend on the gambler's ruin results. This work was inspired by a recent paper of Antal, Ben-Naim, and Krapivsky [\cite=Antal:2010uh], who posed the equalization problem while working in the context of first-passage theory, and provided a closed form expression for the solution. The expressions in the current paper, however, are new.

Let Sn = Bn - Wn, the excess of black over white balls after n draws. Sn is a Markov process that starts at S0 = b - w > 0, and at each step either increases by one, if a black ball is drawn, or decreases by one, if a white ball is drawn. The probabilities of these two events are just Bn / Nn and Wn / Nn, respectively, where Nn = b + w + n is the number of balls in the urn after n draws. The trajectory of Sn thus resembles a random walk, except that the probabilities of moving up and down change with every step. We are interested in the probability that the path ever touches the S-axis.

We will need one key fact about the process Sn, or equivalently, about Bn: the fraction of black balls, Bn / Nn, has a random limit Z, which is given by the [formula] distribution:

[formula]

An elementary proof may be obtained by following the reasoning in de Finetti [\cite=finetti_theory_1975], who shows how the Pólya urn process may be modeled using random draws from the uniform distribution. For a less elementary proof, see [\cite=Freedman:1965tv]. It follows that μn = Sn / Nn also converges, to [formula]. We write [formula] for the distribution function of the beta distribution.

If a Pólya urn is started with b black and w white balls, then the probability that the number of black and white balls will ever be equal is [formula].

Let τ be the random time at which the path first touches the boundary S = 0. The probability of equalization is just the probability of the event {τ  <    ∞  }, which can be divided into the two events [formula] and [formula]. (The probability that μ = 0 is zero, because the density in Eq. ([\ref=eq:beta]) is continuous.) But these two events have equal probability. Indeed, μ depends only on [formula], because the initial segment is finite, and has no effect on the mean. At time τ, the urn has an equal number of black and white balls, so the mean of its subsequent trajectory is equally likely to be positive or negative. Furthermore, if μ < 0, then τ  <    ∞  . Indeed, if μ < 0, then the path will eventually be below the axis, and since it started out above the axis, it must cross at some point. Thus, The last expression follows from the fact that μ < 0 if and only if [formula].

The equalization probability can also be expressed as a binomial sum, due to an interesting connection between the beta and uniform distributions. Let [formula] be n independent samples from the uniform distribution on
