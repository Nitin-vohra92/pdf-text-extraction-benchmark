Abstract

We present three types of non-conformal symmetries for a wide class of 2D dilaton-gravity models. For the particular CGHS, or string-inspired model a linear combination of these symmetries is conformal and turns out to be the well-known symmetry which allows to construct the exactly solvable semiclassical RST and BPP models. We show that one of these non-conformal symmetries can be converted into a conformal one by means of a suitable field redefinition involving the metric and the derivatives of the dilaton. As a consequence of this, and by defining a Polyakov-type term in terms of an invariant metric under the symmetry, we are able to provide, for a generic 2D dilaton gravity model, associated semiclassical models which are symmetry invariant.

Two-dimensional dilaton gravity models

Nowadays one of the main objectives of Theoretical Physics is to produce a quantum theory of gravity. The four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity theory, with action

[formula]

is, however, very complex to handle. Toy models, i.e., models which share with Einstein gravity its most relevant features but are far simpler to deal with should, therefore, play an important role here. 2D dilaton models (2DDM) are two-dimensional models of gravity which are general covariant and involve a dilaton field. These models have classical solutions describing the formation of two-dimensional black holes. Therefore, 2DDMs can be applied to study the dynamics of black holes in a simplified setting.

2DDMs have appeared in diverse areas of theoretical physics, string theory in particular [\cite=Witten], but they can simply be regarded as models of gravity in which all but two dimensions have been frozen out. Consider for instance four-dimensional spherically-symmetric Einstein gravity (SSG). The metric can be parametrized as

[formula]

where [formula] and φ are defined on a two-dimensional manifold which can be co-ordinatized by t and r. If we place the metric ([\ref=ss]) into the Einstein-Hilbert action ([\ref=EH]) we get [formula]

[formula]

2DDMs generalize the SSG model and their general action can be written in the form

[formula]

where D and F are arbitrary functions.

A result which is particularly useful is that after suitable redefinitions of the two-dimensional metric gμν and the dilaton field φ every action can be brought to the form [\cite=Banks] [\cite=Gegenberg]

[formula]

The CGHS model, Hawking radiation and the BPP and RST models

The CGHS or string-inspired model of two-dimensional dilaton gravity [\cite=Witten] [\cite=CGHS]

[formula]

has attracted particular attention because it posseses an extra conformal symmetry

[formula]

which makes the model solvable (see [\cite=Kazama]).

In two dimensions Hawking radiation, which is a result of the trace anomaly

[formula]

and its back-reaction on the black-hole geometry can be taken into account at a semiclassical level by adding to the classical action [formula] a Polyakov-Liouville term

[formula]

However, since this term is not invariant under the symmetry ([\ref=symmetry]), the semiclassical action [formula] is neither invariant nor solvable.

This problem can be solved as follows. Suppose we are able to find a metric [formula] and a dilaton field [formula] such that [formula] . If now we express the action [formula] in terms of the barred variables and add the Polyakov-Liouville term also written in terms of the barred metric, the resultant semiclassical action will clearly be symmetry invariant. Going back to the unbarred quantities by undoing the change of variables we end up with a semiclassical action [formula] which is symmetry invariant, being [formula] a symmetry-restoring counterterm.

For the CGHS model, it is easy to see that the tilded functions

[formula]

which bring the action ([\ref=CGHS]) into the form ([\ref=GDG2]) with ṽ = 4λ2 can be used as barred variables. By using these barred quantities, the above-described procedure gives rise to the following semiclassical symmetry-invariant action

[formula]

with

[formula]

which is the BPP model [\cite=BPP]. A new change of variables

[formula]

yields the RST model [\cite=RST].

For completeness we would like to mention that the BPP action ([\ref=BPP]) can also be obtained by (formally) promediating the action [formula] over the one-parameter group generated by the symmetry ([\ref=symmetry]).

New symmetries in generic 2D dilaton gravity

Now we shall see that what have been done in the previous section with the CGHS model can also be done - with suitable modifications - with a generic 2D dilaton model of gravity.

Leaving aside the matter term which will be introduced later, the general action for 2DDMs ([\ref=GDG2]) is invariant under the following symmetries (the tildes will be dropped from now on)

[formula]

The Noether currents are, respectively

[formula]

[formula]

In the limiting case V = 4λ2 the symmetry δ  =  δ2 - 4λ2δ1 is the conformal symmetry ([\ref=symmetry]) of the string inspired model. It is apparent, therefore, that we have generalized the symmetry of the CGHS model to an arbitrary 2D dilaton gravity model - albeit the symmetry is no longer conformal.

Now we can apply the above-described procedure to produce a semiclassical action which is invariant under δ. It reads

[formula]

where [formula] and

[formula]

with

[formula]

Eq. ([\ref=Emetric]) is the simplest metric which is invariant under δ  =  δ2 - 4λ2δ1 and such that [formula] when V = 4λ2, and det gμν =   det μν . Therefore the action ([\ref=invact]) will reduce to the BPP model ([\ref=BPP]) for V  =  4λ2. Notice, however, that up to the CGHS and exponential models the action ([\ref=invact]) contains second derivatives and that the counterterm added to the Polyakov-Liouville term to preserve the symmetry is necessarily non-local.

In conclusion, we have provided a semiclassical action for generic 2DDM which is invariant under the transformation

[formula]

This is the standard expression for the symmetry of the CGHS model which allows to reduce the associated sigma model to a (solvable) Liouville-type theory. We expect that a generalization of the approach of Ref. [\cite=Kazama] to a second order non-linear sigma model could imply solvability of the present theory, in terms of the invariant metric.
