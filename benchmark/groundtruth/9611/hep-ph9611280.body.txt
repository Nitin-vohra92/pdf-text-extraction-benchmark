ABSTRACT

By incorporating gravity from the outset, superstring theories appear to provide a 'more complete' unification of the fundamental forces than standard supersymmetric grand unification. It is natural to suspect that the string unification scale Mc is comparable to the (reduced) Planck Mass M  ~  2.4  ×  1018 GeV. More concrete calculations suggest that Mc is about an order of magnitude below M. This still poses difficulties for the theory since it would seem to be inconsistent with the scale MGUT  ~  2  ×  1016 GeV deduced from considerations of the low energy data.

A number of ideas have been put forward to tackle this problem, including the existence of a grand unified group, the presence of new particles at an intermediate scale or, more recently, the possibility that Mc can indeed be lowered to coincide with MGUT. One approach for resolving this discrepancy has to do with the potential string threshold corrections. This can be realized in certain orbifold compactification schemes in which the consistency of the string unification scale Mc with the low energy data is achieved by an appropriate choice of the modular weights of the matter fields [\cite=Ross]. Following these authors, we refer to them as "minimal string unification". Moreover, in a special class of such models [\cite=ibanez1] on which we will focus here, the supersymmetry breaking soft terms are characterized in terms of the gravitino mass m3 / 2, the modular weights ni and a mixing angle θ defined by  tan θ  =  〈FS〉  /  〈FT〉. Here 〈FS〉 and 〈FT〉 denote the magnitude of the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the F-terms of the dilaton and modulus supermultiplets S and T. For simplicity we will assume the presence of a single dominant modulus T.

An attractive feature of this approach, which was recently emphasized, is that it leads to a number of 'low energy' predictions which can be tested at LEPII, Tevatron and, of course, the LHC [\cite=khalil]. In particular, within the framework of radiative electroweak breaking it was shown that in the small tan β region, the lightest charged sparticles include a chargino and the (right) sleptons, and that interesting correlations occur between their masses and with the mass of the lightest higgs [\cite=khalil]. These should provide important tests of the particular superstring inspired scheme.

In this paper we wish to pursue this investigation further by focussing in particular on the composition and mass of the LSP. Remarkably, the lightest neutralino turns out to be the LSP ( without imposing additional requirements), and it is very nearly a pure bino for much of the parameter range. It annihilates predominantly into lepton - antilepton pairs via the 'right' slepton exchange. These considerations, and in particular the requirement that ΩLSP  ≤  0.9 ( with Ωtotal = 1 from inflation) lead us to a fairly stringent upper bound on the LSP mass which depends on the "mixing angle" θ. For θ  =  π / 2 i.e. in the pure dilaton case, for instance, the upper bound is 160 GeV, with the maximum value of 300 GeV occuring for θ close to 0.98 radian. Furthermore, this enables us to provide upper bounds on the sparticle masses, as well as a lower bound (of ~  65 GeV) on the mass of the lightest (CP even) neutral higgs. Note that the lower bound of 65 GeV by LEP 1.5 on the lightest chargino mass implies a lower bound on the LSP mass of 32 GeV which is rather insensitive to the θ parameter. Our analysis in the context of minimal string unification agrees with some previous results obtained by De Carlos and Kraniotis  [\cite=kraniotis] in effective supergravities.

In ref [\cite=khalil], following minimal string unification, we studied the phenomenological implications of effective supergravity theories derived from string vacua with N=1 supersymmetry spontaneously broken by the dilaton and moduli F-terms [\cite=ibanez1]. The mass spectrum in this approach is determined in terms of two independent parameters, the dilaton-modulus mixing angle θ and the gravitino mass m3 / 2. The various soft supersymmetry breaking terms at the compactification scale are characterized as follows. The scalar masses are

[formula]

where ni are the various modular weights given in ref [\cite=Ross] to obtain minimal string unification:

[formula]

The above modular weights are taken to be family-independent. The asymptotic gaugino masses are

[formula]

In the soft sector of the trilinear scalar couplings we focus only on the A-term which is related to the top quark Yukawa coupling At. It is given by:

[formula]

The bilinear soft breaking term BμH1H2 (where H1 and H2 denote the scalar doublets) depends on the origin of the μ-term in the superpotential. If μ arises solely from the S and T sector then, as pointed out in ref [\cite=ibanez1], B takes the form:

[formula]

Given the boundary conditions in equations ([\ref=scalar]) to ([\ref=b]) at the compactification scale, we determine the evolution of the 'couplings' according to their one loop renormalization group equations (RGE) in order to estimate the mass spectrum of the supersymmetric particles at the weak scale. The radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario imposes the following well known conditions among the renormalized quantities:

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

[formula]

where tan β  =  〈H02〉  /  〈H01〉 is the ratio of the two higgs vevs that give masses to the up and down type quarks and mH1, mH2 are the two higgs masses at the electroweak scale.

Using equations ([\ref=scalar])-([\ref=minimization]) we find that μ and tan β are specified in terms of the goldstino angle θ and the gravitino mass m3 / 2. As is the case in MSSM, in our scheme too the results are in general sensitive to the sign of μ. We find that the choice of negative μ allows for a lighter sparticle spectrum, in particular the chargino and the right selectron. In view of our special interest in potential discoveries at LEPII, we adopt this choice for the sign of μ in the present analysis. Also, for tan β we prefer to work in the low tan β regime, i.e. in the RGE evolution we consider that all Yukawa couplings, except ht, are much smaller than unity. Interestingly enough, it turns out that only a rather narrow interval is allowed, namely 1.5  ≤   tan β  ≤  3.5. As explained in  [\cite=khalil], an important constraint on θ arises from the requirement of colour and especially electric charge conservations, namely 0.98rad.  <  θ  <  2rad (the upper bound is not sensitive to the sign of μ ).

The neutralinos χ0i (i=1,2,3,4) are the physical (mass) superpositions of the Higgsinos H̃01, H̃02, and the two neutral gauginos 0 (bino) and W̃03 (wino). The neutralino mass matrix is given by [\cite=nilles]

[formula]

where M1 and M2 now refer to 'low energy' quantities whose asymptotic values are given in equations ([\ref=m1]) and ([\ref=m2]). The lightest eigenstates 01 is a linear combination of the original fields:

[formula]

where the unitary matrix Nij relates the 0i fields to the original ones. The entries of this matrix depend on tan β, M2 and μ which, as previously mentioned, are determined in terms of θ and m3 / 2. The dependence of the 01 (LSP) mass on m3 / 2 is shown in figure 1. A useful parameter for describing the neutralino composition is the gaugino "purity" function [\cite=report]

[formula]

We plot this function versus m3 / 2 in figure (2) which clearly shows that the LSP is essentially a pure bino.

Given the LSP mass as a function of m3 / 2 and θ  and that it is bino like, we find that the annihilation is predominantly into leptons, with the other channels [\cite=report] either closed or suppressed. The annihilation process is dominated by the exchange of the three slepton families (ẽR,ẽL, etc). The squark exchanges are suppressed due to their large mass, while the Z-boson contribution is suppressed, except for mχ  ~  mZ / 2, due to the small Zχχ coupling (ig / 2 cos θW)(N213 - N214)γμγ5.

For the computation of the lightest neutralino relic abundance we follow the standard procedure [\cite=ellis]. First we need to determine the thermally averaged cross section 〈σAv〉  ~  a  +  bv [\cite=grist]. Since the lepton masses are small compared to mLSP, we find that a  ~  0, while b is given by:

[formula]

where GF is the Fermi constant, [formula], with

[formula]

[formula]

and

[formula]

is the Z pole factor with ΓZ the Z decay width. Finally,

[formula]

Here T3L is the weak isospin, el is the lepton charge, sin 2θW = 0.23, cL = T3L - el sin 2θW and cR =  - el sin 2θW.

Given a and b we can determine the freeze-out temperature TF, below which the χχ annihilation rate is smaller than the expansion rate of the universe. Following refs( [\cite=ellis], [\cite=kolb] and  [\cite=grist]) we can iteratively compute the freeze-out temperature from

[formula]

Here xF = mχ / TF, MP  =  1.22  ×  1019 GeV is the Planck mass and g* ([formula]) is the effective number of relativistic degrees of fredom at TF. Also c = 1 / 2 as explained in Ref [\cite=nojiri].

The relic LSP density is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

h is the well known Hubble parameter, 0.4  ≤  h  ≤  0.8, and ρc  ~  2  ×  10- 29h2 is the critical density of the universe. Motivated by the inflationary scenario we will assume that the total density parameter ΩTOT = 1.

Figure 3 shows the relic abundance of the lightest neutralino Ωχh2 as function of the gravitino mass in the case of dilaton supersymmetry breaking, i.e. θ  =  π / 2. We require the neutralino relic density to be 0.1  ≤  ΩLSP  ≤  0.9, with 0.4  ≤  h  ≤  0.8. We find that there is no point in the parameter space (m3 / 2  , θ ) that leads to Ωχh2 less than the minimum value (0.014), while the maximum value (0.576) imposes an upper bound on m3 / 2  which is very sensitive to θ , as shown in figure 4. In turn, this leads to ( a fairly stringent) upper bound on the LSP mass of about 160 GeV. For θ≃0.98rad., which represents the maximum moduli contibution to SUSY breaking, i.e. maximal non-universal soft SUSY breaking terms, this bound approaches 300 GeV.

The bounds on the gravitino mass can be translated into bounds on the sparticle masses. We are particularly interested in the particles which possibly can be seen at LEPII, Tevatron or the LHC. These include the lightest higgs scalar (h0) as well as the "right" selectron and the lightest chargino. At tree level, the mass of h0 is determined by

[formula]

where m2A = m2H1 + m2H2 + 2μ2. The leading radiative corrections to m2h0 depend on the fourth power of the top mass as well as on mt̃1,2, At, μ and tan β. The expression for the lightest higgs mass which we used in our calculation has the form  [\cite=haber]

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

and Ãt = At  +  μ cot β , where the functions h and f are given by

[formula]

This expression provides the upper bound on mh for a given stop spectrum which is completely determined in terms of m3 / 2 and θ. However including two-loop effects remains necessary to obtain a correct estimate of the higgs mass. It was shown in Ref [\cite=haber] that the two loop leading logarithmic contributions to m2h are incorporated by replacing mt in equation ([\ref=1lop]) by the running top quark mass evaluated at the scale μt which is given by [formula] where Mt is the pole mass of the top quark and [formula]. Then the lightest higgs mass is given by

[formula]

Figure 5 shows how the higgs mass varies with m3 / 2 and θ, and we see that in the low tan β regime and with μ  >  0 ( which gives maximum mixing in our convention), the mass mh satisfies 80GeV  ≤  mh  ≤  115GeV. The lower bound reaches 65 Gev in the case of μ < 0 and θ = 2 rad.

We can similarly determine both the lower and upper bounds on all the supersymmetric particles since they are given in terms of the goldstino angle θ and the gravitino mass m3 / 2. For instance, we find that the mass of the pseudoscalar A lies between 200 GeV and 2 TeV, while the gluino mass is between 400 GeV and 2.5 TeV.

In conclusion, we have discussed how the composition and cosmic abandance of the LSP in the so-called minimal superstring unification leads to important constraints on the underlying supersymmetry breaking parameters. In addition, one finds lower and upper bounds on the higgs and sparticle mass spectrum. For instance, the "Weinberg-Salam" higgs is estimated to lie in the mass range of 85-145 GeV. The squarks and gluinos turn out to be heavy but, depending on the parameters, a charged slepton or a chargino could still be found at LEPII.
