A local Tb theorem for square functions in domains with Ahlfors-David regular boundaries

Introduction, statement of results, history

The Tb Theorems are boundedness criteria for singular integrals which show that a singular integral operator T is L2 bounded if it has sufficiently good behavior on some suitable non-degenerate test function b. Such theorems were first proved in [formula] by McIntosh and Meyer in [\cite=McM], and David, Journé and Semmes in [\cite=DJS]. A “local Tb theorem” is a variant of the standard Tb theorem, in which instead of controlling the action of the operator T on a single, globally defined accretive test function b, it suffices to control locally, on each dyadic cube Q, the action of T on a test function bQ, which satisfies some uniform, scale invariant Lp bound along with the non-degeneracy condition

[formula]

for some uniform constant C > 0. M. Christ proved in [\cite=Ch] the first local Tb theorem, in which the local test functions are assumed to belong uniformly to L∞; an extension of Christ's result to the non-doubling setting is due to Nazarov, Treil and Volberg [\cite=NTV] and Hytönen and Martikainen [\cite=HyM]. For doubling measures, one can also consider more general Lp type testing conditions introduced by Auscher, Hofmann, Muscalu, Tao and Thiele [\cite=AHMMT], and further studied by Hofmann [\cite=H2], Auscher and Yang [\cite=AY], Auscher and Routin [\cite=AR], Hytönen and Martikainen [\cite=HyM] and Tan and Yan [\cite=TY].

It is also interesting to consider local Tb theorems for square functions (as opposed to singular integrals). In the Euclidean setting the result obtained in our work was presented in [\cite=H1], but was already implicit in the solution of the Kato problem [\cite=HMc], [\cite=HLMc], [\cite=AHLMcT], (see also [\cite=AT] and [\cite=Se] for related results), and more recently has found application to variable coefficient layer potentials [\cite=AAAHK]. Our result is applicable to problems that connect the behavior of the harmonic measure for domains with uniformly rectifiable boundaries (see [\cite=HMar] and [\cite=HMUT]).

Notation and Preliminaries

An n-dimensional set [formula] is Ahlfors-David regular and we write E∈ADR, if E is closed and for every ball B(x,r) centered at x∈E and of radius [formula],

[formula]

for some positive constant C.

Throughout the paper we shall consider [formula], E = ∂Ω∈ADR. Observe that Ω need not be connected.

The following lemma shows that for ADR spaces or even for spaces for homogeneous-type one can build a family of subsets of E that play the same role that dyadic cubes do in the Euclidean space. For the construction of such "cubes" see for example [\cite=Ch], [\cite=D1], [\cite=HytK] and [\cite=AHyt].

Let [formula] be in ADR. Then there exist constants α0  >  0, η  >  0 and C1,C2  <    ∞  , depending only on dimension and the ADR constants, such that for each [formula], there is a collection of Borel sets ("cubes") where Ik denotes some (possibly finite) index set depending on k, satisfying

[formula] for each [formula].

If k  <  k', then either [formula] or [formula], [formula], [formula].

For each (l,k') and each k < k', there is a unique j such that [formula].

If [formula] then

[formula]

Each Qkj contains some "surface ball" [formula].

For all k,j and for all τ∈(0,α0),

[formula]

Let us now mention few remarks concerning the last lemma.

We shall denote by [formula] the collection of all relevant Qkj, i.e.,

[formula]

If diam(E) is finite we ignore all those [formula] such that [formula] and thus previously the union runs over all those k's for which [formula].

For a dyadic cube [formula] we set [formula] and we shall refer to this quantity as the "length" of Q. Obviously, [formula].

In view of [\cite=HSw] and [\cite=HMY], a sequence of operators [formula] is said to be an approximation to the identity if there exist 0 < ε and 0 < A,C <   ∞   such that for all x,x',y and y'∈E, the kernel of Sk, are functions from E  ×  E into [formula] satisfying

[formula]

Notice that the bound in [\eqref=Sj.pointwise] can be replaced by [formula]. Indeed, since Sj is supported in the set {|x - y| < C2- j}, it is always true that

[formula]

We shall introduce now some notation. Let [formula] be as before and I be an n + 1-dimensional cube, then given a "surface" cube Q, we define an associated " Whitney region" as follows: Let W  =  W(Ω) denote a collection of dyadic Whitney cubes of Ω, so that the cubes in W form a pairwise non-overlapping covering of Ω, which satisfy

[formula]

(just divide dyadically the standard Whitney cubes, as constructed in [\cite=St], Chapter VI, into cubes with side length 1 / 8 as large) and also

[formula]

whenever I1 and I2 "touch". Since E is closed, Ω is open and so it allows a Whitney decomposition [formula] where

[formula]

Fix x∈E. Then we define the cone Γβ  (x) with vertex x and aperture β > 0 to be

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

The Q-truncated cone will be denoted by

[formula]

Observe that, by choosing β sufficiently large, depending on the Ahlfors-David parameters, we may suppose that [formula], for every Q. We fix now such a β which we use in the sequel and for simplicity we write Γ(x), ΓQ(x), CQ and UQ.

We also define

[formula]

where for ψ(X,y), there exist C > 0 and α > 0, such that

[formula]

Our main goal is to prove the following theorem.

Let E∈ADR and Θ be as in definition [\ref=definitiontheta]. Suppose also that there exists a positive constant C0, p∈(1,  ∞  ) and a system {bQ} of funtions indexed by dyadic cubes Q  ⊆  E, such that for each dyadic cube [formula],

[formula]

Then there exists a positive constant C such that the following square function estimate holds.

[formula]

Notice that in the case p = 2, [\eqref=main.theorem.eq3] is equivalent to

[formula]

where [formula].

In section [\ref=sec.3] we prove our results in the case that E is unbounded and the proof of the theorem goes through the proof of an auxiliary lemma (Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma]) and a T1 theorem for square functions, while in section [\ref=sec.4], we show that the same result holds even in the case that E is bounded.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] when E is an unbounded ADR set

To prove Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] we shall need the following lemma.

Suppose that there are η∈(0,1) and C1 > 0 such that for every cube [formula] there exists a family F  =  {Qk} of dyadic subcubes of Q such that for any p∈(1,2],

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then, there exists a positive constant C such that

[formula]

The "good" cubes are those Q'  ⊆  Q that are not contained in any Qk∈F and Good(Q) is sometimes called the discrete sawtooth relative to the family F.

Let us give an outline of the proof. We first show that the conditions of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] imply the conditions of Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma]. Then we prove Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma] and by the use of a T1 Theorem for square functions that we show at the end, we conclude Theorem [\ref=main.theorem].

Conditions of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] imply conditions of Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma]

Fix [formula] and then for this cube we choose the family F  =  {Qk} as subcubes of Q maximal with respect to the stopping time condition [formula]; thus, we have that [formula], for every Q'∈Good(Q), where

[formula]

Then the proof of [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq1] follows from [\eqref=main.theorem.eq1] and [\eqref=main.theorem.eq2] by following mutatis mutandi the corresponding argument in [\cite=H1], so it is enough to check the validity of [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq2].

[formula]

and it remains to prove that the latter is less than a constant multiple of σ(Q). At this point we shall use the Coifman-Meyer method and decompose

[formula]

and by [\eqref=main.theorem.eq3] we only need to prove that or equivalently,

[formula]

By the discrete Calderón's reproducing formula [\eqref=C-Z.reproducing] one can write

[formula]

where [formula]. If φj(  ·  ,  ·  ) is the kernel of Dj, the latter part of the equation above is equal to

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us recall that the diameter of the cube Q' is 2- k since [formula] and decompose the problem in two cases. We first let the indices k,j to be so that 2- k  ≤  C22- j and x be an arbitrary point of Q'. Since [formula] we can subtract φj(x,w) for free and thus Tj(w,Y) is equal to We shall now write the domain of integration as the union of its subsets

[formula]

where C2,C3 > 0 are absolute constant appropriately chosen later on. Therefore, Tj(w,Y) can be written as the sum T1j(w,Y) + T2j(w,Y), where

[formula]

for i = 1,2. By Hölder's continuity of φj and simple geometric considerations one can see that

[formula]

The latter, along with the bound [formula], the pointwise bounds of ψ and that δ(Y)  ≈  2- k and |Y - z|  ≈  2- k + |x - z|, since x∈Q' and Y∈UQ', shows that

[formula]

where in the last inequality we used the fact that [formula] Moreover, if we define

[formula]

and

[formula]

then T2j(w,Y) = T2,1j(w,Y) - T2,2j(w,Y). It is not hard to see that T2,1j(w,Y) = 0. Indeed, if x∈Q' and l(Q')  ≈  2- k, then |x - z| > C32- (k + j) / 2 > C32- k, and thus we can choose C3 big enough so that [formula], which proves our claim. To this end, it is only left to bound T2,2j(w,Y). For, if we set [formula], obviously, [formula], which in turn shows that

[formula]

Clearly,

[formula]

where M stands for the dyadic Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, which after applying Fubini conveniently above, allows us to conclude that

[formula]

We now turn our attention to the case that [formula]. We treat Tj(w,Y) by writing it as the difference

[formula]

and then we bound each part separately. The main difficulty relies on estimating I1j(w,Y) while it is fairly easy to derive the desired bound for I2j(w,Y). Indeed, by choosing C2 depending on the dimension and the support of φj so that 2|z - w|  ≤  |Y - w|, we have

[formula]

Since φj(z,w) is supported in the ball {|z - w| < C2- j}, the latter is bounded by a constant multiple of which, in turn, in glance of [formula], shows that

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

In order to handle I1j(w) we shall introduce an auxiliary function ηQ' ∈ C∞0(Q') that vanishes outside Q' and is identically 1 in a set R  ⊂  Q', which set has the additional property

[formula]

Moreover, we may assume that ηQ' satisfies the estimate

[formula]

Before we show that we can construct such a function let us see how it helps us bound I1j(w,Y). By adding and subtracting ηQ' in I1j(w,Y) the latter is equal to

[formula]

Since [formula] and φj(z,w) = 0 for |z - w| > C2- j, by the mean value theorem,

[formula]

where [formula] is a "fattened version" of Q' in E. Therefore, using that [formula],

[formula]

On the other hand, by Fubini and the size estimates of [formula],

[formula]

which by Hölder's inequality for [formula] is bounded by

[formula]

where r' is the Hölder conjugate of r. Putting everything together we can conclude that there exists [formula] such that uniformly for every x∈Q'.

Notice that the right part of the last inequality is controlled by [formula], and thus, the left part of inequality [\eqref=c3.Cond.Th=>Cond.Lemma.Good.Sq.F.Est.Rf] is

[formula]

At this point we shall make use of the inequalities for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator that were proved in [\cite=FS] (the techniques to prove the result also apply to our setting) or in a more general context in [\cite=GCRDF], which in conjunction with [\eqref=bound.tilde.Dj] and [\eqref=main.theorem.eq2] allows to obtain our result.

[formula]

where in the last step we have used [\eqref=bound.tilde.Dj]. This proves [\eqref=c3.Cond.Th=>Cond.Lemma.Good.Sq.F.Est.Rf] and consequently [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq2].

It only remains to prove our earlier claim and show that there exists ηQ' with the aforementioned properties. For, we cover Q' by non-overlapping dyadic cubes [formula] where 2- m  ≈  2- (k + j) / 2 and we remove those that satisfy the condition [formula]. We shall say that the remaining ones are in the collection [formula]. We choose C1 large enough depending on the constant α0 > 0 defined in Lemma [\ref=Not.Dyad.Cubes] so that

[formula]

and also [formula] and [formula] for all [formula]. We now take a partition of unity [formula] subordinate to the family of the surface balls [formula] (i.e., we take [formula] subordinate to the family of balls [formula] and then we restrict the domain to E) so that if [formula] then

[formula]

and also,

[formula]

If we define

[formula]

then it is not hard to check that it satisfies the required properties.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma] for p = 2

Let us define

[formula]

where

We fix a cube Q and by splitting the domain of integration in order to exploit the size estimates of Qk and the square function bounds over the complement of a discretized "sawtooth" region related to the family {Qk} we have that

[formula]

One may notice that for every [formula], ΓQ(x) = γQ(x) and ΓQ,ε(x) = γQ,ε(x).

Therefore,

[formula]

where in the last inequality we used [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq2]. For the bound of [formula] we fix a cube Qk and then observe that if x∈Qk then [formula], which in turn lets us have

[formula]

Summing over all k's, in light of the definition of K(ε) and [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq1], we have that

[formula]

Moreover, by our hypothesis [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq2] and the fact that γQ,ε(x)  ⊂  γQ(x),

[formula]

Therefore, by [\eqref=c3.proof.of.lemma.II], [\eqref=c3.proof.of.lemma.I_k1] and [\eqref=c3.proof.of.lemma.I_k2] we get for some constant C > 0 and after we divide both sides by σ(Q) and take the supremum over Q we finally have that

[formula]

By truncation, for each fixed ε > 0, K(ε) <   ∞  , which in turn shows that,

[formula]

uniformly in ε, by observing that the constants do not depend on ε. To this end, by letting ε  →  0 we obtain

[formula]

and conclude Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma] for the special case p = 2.

We now turn to the proof of Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma] in full generality.

Proof of Lemma [\ref=3.1] for any p∈(1,  ∞  )

By Hölder's inequality and an argument of Fefferman and Stein [\cite=FS2] (since bQ need not be compactly supported) the case p > 2 can be reduced to the case p = 2 which was handled before. Therefore, we only need to prove Theorem [\ref=main.theorem], for p ranging in the open interval (1,2). To do so, we state and prove Lemma [\ref=c4.sublemma] and then show that the conditions of Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma] imply the conditions of Lemma [\ref=c4.sublemma]. Let us fix p∈(1,2) for the remainder of this section.

If there exist a positive and finite constant N and a constant 0 < β < 1, so that for every dyadic cube Q,

[formula]

where then [\eqref=T1.Carleson.measure.cond.] holds.

Fix a dyadic cube Q and let us define

[formula]

where ΓQ,ε(x) is as in [\eqref=K(epsilon).p=2] and set [formula]. Since σ is an outer regular Borel measure, we may choose ON,ε, relatively open in Q, such that

[formula]

We shall prove that if then there exists a C > 0 such that K(ε) < C, uniformly in ε.

For, since ON,ε is relatively open in Q we can decompose it via a stopping time argument to find a disjoint family of dyadic cubes {Qj}j so that [formula], maximal with respect to inclusion in ON,ε. If we set [formula], we have that

[formula]

It is not hard to see that

[formula]

In view of [\eqref=c4.sublemma.hypoth.], since Qj's are mutually disjoint,

[formula]

For the bound of II it suffices to make the following observation. If we fix a cube Qj and x∈Qj then by the definition of our cones and the maximality of Qj's, there exists a point xj in the dyadic father of Qj, say Q*j, such that xj∈FN,ε. Therefore, since γQ,ε(x)  ⊆  γQ,ε(xj), we have that gQ,ε(x)  ≤  gQ,ε(xj), which in turn, entails

[formula]

In light of [\eqref=c4.gQ.split], [\eqref=c4.sublemma.I] and [\eqref=c4.sublemma.II], which after taking the supremum over all cubes Q, since K(ε) <   ∞  , we obtain

[formula]

If we let [formula], we conclude [\eqref=T1.Carleson.measure.cond.].

We shall show now that the conditions of Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma] imply the conditions of Lemma [\ref=c4.sublemma]. Indeed. let us denote DN: = {x∈Q:gQ(x) > N} for a large N > 0 to be chosen. It is enough to prove that there exists 0 < β < 1 such that

[formula]

To this end,

[formula]

where we have used [\eqref=c3.theorem.eq2] and the fact that for any [formula], ΓQ(x) = γQ(x). Now, if we have choose N > 0 large enough so that C / N  ≤  η / 2 and denote β  =  η / 2, [\eqref=c4.eq.Cond.Lemma=>Cond.Sub] is concluded and so is Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma].

Conclusion of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem]

After proving Lemma [\ref=c3.lemma], we are ready to deduce the conclusion of Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] once we show a T1 theorem for square functions, i.e., it is enough to prove the following extension of a result of Christ and Journé [\cite=CJ] in the Euclidean case (which is exactly the case that [formula] and [formula] or [formula].

Let Θf be defined as in [\eqref=Theta] where ψ(X,y) satisfies the conditions [\eqref=psi.ptwise.estimate] and [\eqref=psi.holder.cont]. If

[formula]

then

[formula]

It is not hard to see that if we decompose Ω using the "Whitney boxes" UQ associated with the "dyadic grid" [formula] and enlarge the area of integration, we have that

[formula]

We shall use the Coifman-Meyer method and write

[formula]

For the contribution of Rf to the estimate, we introduce an average over the cube Q, [formula] and then apply Fubini and by the same method we used in the subsection [\ref=3.1], it can be easily seen that

[formula]

Therefore, it is enough to prove that

[formula]

For this, we shall make use of the discrete version of the Carleson's embedding lemma which is stated as follows.

(Discrete Carleson's embedding lemma) If αQ satisfy the Carleson condition

[formula]

for any cube [formula], then

[formula]

To show [\eqref=T1.Embedding.bound] let us set

[formula]

Therefore, by Fubini,

[formula]

where the last inequality follows from [\eqref=T1.Carleson.measure.cond.]. So, αQ satisfies [\eqref=Carleson.measure] and by Carleson's embedding lemma, [\eqref=T1.Embedding.bound] holds. This concludes the proof of Theorem [\ref=T1theorem].

We now provide the reader with the proof of Carleson's lemma, although it is already known, in order to make our presentation more self-contained.

(of the discrete Carleson's embedding lemma) We may assume without loss of generality that f∈L2(E), given λ > 0 there exists r > 0 large enough, so that if diam(Q) > r then

[formula]

If we perform a Calderón-Zygmund stopping time argument on each Q we obtain a maximal family of cubes {Qj}j with respect to the property [formula], and we have

[formula]

To conclude the proof it is enough to show that if [formula] and

[formula]

then

[formula]

where [formula] stands for the Carleson norm of our measure which is defined by [\eqref=Carleson.measure]. To this end, observe that

[formula]

where [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] when E is a bounded ADR set

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=main.theorem] in the case that the ADR set E is a bounded subset of Rn + 1, which means that diam(E) = :r0  <    ∞  . Then, there exists an n + 1-dimensional ball Br0 such that E  ⊆  Br0. If we denote Bmr0 to be the ball of radius mr0 which is concentric with Br0, we have that

[formula]

Term I may be handled by our previous arguments when E is unbounded and the verification is left to the reader. Hence, to conclude the theorem, we only need to handle II. To this end,

[formula]
