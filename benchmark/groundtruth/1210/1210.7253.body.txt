Bipartition of graphs based on the normalized cut and spectral methods

Introduction

Clustering techniques are common in multivariate data analysis, data mining, machine learning, and so on. The goal of the clustering or partitioning problem is to find groups such that entities within the same group are similar and different groups are dissimilar. In the graph-partitioning problem, much attention is given to find the precise criteria to obtain a good partition. Clustering methods that use eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated with graphs are called spectral clustering methods and are widely used in graph- partitioning problems. In particular, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Laplacian matrices play a vital role in graph-partitioning problems. In 1973, Fiedler defined the second smallest eigenvalue λ2 of a difference Laplacian matrix as the algebraic connectivity of a graph [\cite=fielder:1973]. In 1975, he showed that we can decompose a graph G into two connected components by only using the sign structure of an eigenvector related to the second smallest eigenvalue [\cite=fiedler:1975]. In 2001, Fiedler's investigation was extended by Davies using the discrete nodal domain theorem [\cite=Davis:2001]. Laplacian, normalized Laplacian, and adjacency matrices with negative entries can be used with the nodal domain theorem. This theorem is useful to identify the number of connected sign graphs of a given graph on the basis of their eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

In 1984, Buser [\cite=buser:1984] investigated the graph invariant quantity [formula], which considers the relationship between size of a cut and the size of a separated subset U. He defined the isoperimetric number i(G), and the optimal bisection was given by the minimum i(G). Guattery and Miller [\cite=step:1995] [\cite=step:1998] considered two spectral separation algorithms that partition the vertices on the basis of the values of their corresponding entries in the second eigenvector and, in 1995, they provided some counter examples for which each of these algorithms produce poor separators. They used an eigenvector based on the second smallest eigenvalue of a difference Laplacian matrix as well as a specified number of eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues. Finally, they extended it to the generalized version of spectral methods that allows for the use of more than a constant number of eigenvectors and showed that there are some graphs for which the performance of all the above spectral algorithms was poor. We follow their methods especially in the cases of graph automorphism and even -odd eigenvector theorem for the concrete classes of graphs such as roach graphs, double-trees, and double-tree cross paths. We prefer to use a normalized Laplacian matrix rather than a difference Laplacian matrix, and describe these properties in terms of formal graph notation.

In 1997, Fan Chung [\cite=Fan:1997] discussed the most important theories and properties regarding eigenvalues of normalized Laplacian matrices and their applications to graph separator problems. She considered the partitioning problem using Cheeger constants and derived fundamental relations between the eigenvalues and Cheeger constants. In 2000, Shi and Malik [\cite=shi:2000] proposed a measure of disassociation, called normalized cut, for the image segmentations. This measure computed the cut cost as a fraction of total edge connections. The normalized cut is used to minimize the disassociation between groups and maximize the association within groups. However, minimization of normalized cut criteria is an non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP- hard) problem. Therefore, approximate discrete solutions are required. The solution to the minimization problem of the normalized cut is given by the second smallest eigenvector of the generalized eigensystem, (D - W)y = λDy, where D is the diagonal matrix with vertex degrees and W is a weighted adjacency matrix. Shi and Malik used a minimum normalized cut value as a splitting point and found a bisection using the second smallest eigenvector. They realized that the eigenvectors are well separated and that this type of splitting point is very reliable. The normalized cut introduced by Shi and Malik [\cite=shi:2000] is useful in several areas. This measure is of interest not only for image segmentation but also for network theories and statistics [\cite=Andrew:2001] [\cite=sara:2008] [\cite=sara1:2008] [\cite=du:2004] [\cite=sound:2003].

In this study, we review the known results regarding the difference, normalized, and signless Laplacian matrices. Then, we give uniform proofs for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of paths and cycles. Next, we analyze the minimum normalized cut from the view point of connectivity of graphs and compare the results with those of the spectral bisection method. Special emphasis is given to classify the graphs, that poorly perform on spectral bisections using normalized Laplacian matrices. We use the term Mcut(G) to represent the minimum normalized cut and Lcut(G) to represent the normalized cut of the bipartition created by the second smallest eigenvector of the normalized Laplacian based on the sign pattern. Finding Mcut(G) for a graph is NP-hard. However, we derive a formula for Mcut(G) for some basic classes of graphs such as paths, cycles, complete graphs, double-trees, cycle cross paths, and some complex graphs like lollipop type graphs LPn,m, roach type graphs Rn,k and weighted paths Pn,k. Next, we present characteristic polynomials of the normalized Laplacian matrices L(Pn,k) and L(Rn,k). We provide counter example graphs on the basis of a graph Rn,k on which Mcut(G) and Lcut(G) have different values.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present basic terminologies and key results related to the difference, normalized, and signless Laplacian matrices. In particular, we summarize the upper and lower bounds of the second smallest eigenvalues. We also define graphs that are used in other sections using formal notation. In section 3, we review the properties of the Mcut(G) of graphs and derive formulae for the Mcut(G) of some basic classes of graphs and some complex graphs such as Rn,k, Pn,k, and LPn,m. In section 4, we consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of paths and cycles for the three types of Laplacian matrices introduced above. In particular, we review the eigenvalue formulae for the three types of Laplacian matrices using circulant matrices and then review an alternative proof for the eigenvalues of adjacency matrices of paths and cycles using Chebyshev polynomials. We also give concrete formulae for the characteristic polynomials of the normalized Laplacian matrices L(Pn,k) and L(Rn,k). In section 5, we provide counter example graphs for which spectral techniques perform poorly compared with the normalized cut. Specifically, we find the conditions for which Mcut(G) and Lcut(G) have different values on the Rn,k graph.

Preliminaries

An undirected graph is an ordered pair G = (V(G),E(G)), where V(G) is a finite set, elements of which are called vertices, and we represent V(G) as [formula]. E(G) is a set of two-element subsets of V(G), called edges. Conventionally, we denote an edge {vi,vj} by (vi,vj) in this paper. Two vertices vi and vj of G are called adjacent, if (vi,vj)∈E(G). For simplicity, sometimes we use V instead of V(G) and E instead of E(G). The number of vertices in G is the order of G and the number of edges is the size of G. For a given subset S  ⊆  V, |S| represent the size of the set S. For a subset A  ⊆  V, we represent the set of vertices not belongs to A as [formula]. A graph of order 1 is called a trivial graph. A graph which has two or more vertices is called a nontrivial graph. A graph of size 0 is called an empty graph. Assume that all graphs in this paper are finite, undirected and have edge weight 1.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph and |V| = n. The adjacency matrix A(G) = (aij) of an undirected graph G is a n  ×  n matrix whose entries are given by

Note: For simplicity, sometimes we use D instead of D(G).

The volume of a graph G = (V,E) denoted by [formula], is the sum of the degrees of vertices in V. The volume of a subset A  ⊂  V is denoted by [formula].

The edge connectivity of a graph G is denoted by κ'(G), is the minimum number of edges needed to remove in order to disconnect the graph. A graph is called k-edge connected if every disconnecting set has at least k edges. A 1-edge connected graph is called a connected graph.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph. A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices such that from each of its vertices there is an edge to the next vertex in the sequence. This is denoted by [formula], where (vi,vi + 1)∈E for 0  ≤  i  ≤  k - 1. The length of the path is the number of edges encountered in P.

Let A(G) be the adjacency matrix of a graph G = (V,E), and P be the permutation matrix of permutation φ defined on V. Then φ is an automorphism of G if and only if PA = AP.

The weighted adjacency matrix W = (wij) is defined as

[formula]

The degree di of a vertex vi of a weighted graph is defined by [formula]. Unweighted graphs are special cases, where all edge weights are 0 or 1.

A subset of edges which disconnects the graph is called a graph cut. Let G = (V,E,w) be a weighted graph and W = (wij) the weighted adjacency matrix. Then for A,B  ⊂  V and [formula], the graph cut is denoted by [formula].

The isoperimetric number i(G) of a graph G of order n  ≥  2 is defined as

Let G = (V,E) be a graph. For a nonempty subset S  ⊂  V, define [formula], where [formula]. Then the Cheeger constant(vertex expansion) gG is defined as [formula].

The weighted difference Laplacian L(G) = (lij) is defined as

[formula]

This can be written as L(G) = D(G) - W(G).

The weighted normalized Laplacian [formula] is defined as

The Table [\ref=tab:matrices] shows an adjacency matrix and the three Laplacian matrices discussed in the above for path graph P4.

Let G = (V,E,w) be a weighted graph. Then the eigenvalues of L(G) and D- 1L(G) are equal.

[formula]. Therefore D- 1L(G)  =  L(G) and has the same spectrum.

A graph G = (V,E) is called r-regular, if [formula].

Let [formula] be eigenvalues of difference Laplacian matrix L(G) = D(G) - A(G). Then for any regular graph of degree r, normalized Laplacian eigenvalues are [formula].

[formula]. Then [formula]. Then [formula]. If μi is an eigenvalue of L then it is an eigenvalue of rL(G). This shows that [formula].

Let L(G) be the normalized Laplacian matrix of a graph G and P be the permutation matrix corresponding to the automorphism φ defined on V. If U is an eigenvector of L(G) with an eigenvalue λ, then PU is also an eigenvector of L(G) with the same eigenvalue.

From the definition of automorphism PTL(G)P = L(G). Then L(G)U = λU implies that (PTL(G)P)U = λU. Since PPT = I, we get L(G)PU = λ(PU). If U is an eigenvector of L(G) with an eigenvalue λ then PU is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue.

Remarks.This result holds for any matrix associated with a graph under the automorphism defined on a vertex set.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph and φ:V  →  V be an automorphism of order 2. A vector x is called an even vector if xi = xφ(i) for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n and a vector y is called an odd vector if yi =  - yφ(i) for all 1  ≤  i  ≤  n, where n = |V|.

Let G be a graph, φ be an automorphism of G with order 2 and P a permutation matrix of φ. If an eigenvalue of L(G) is simple then the corresponding eigenvector is odd or even with respect to φ.

Let λ be an eigenvalue, U an eigenvector of L(G). If λ is simple then PU and U are linearly dependent. Then there exists a constant c such that PU = cU. Since P2 = I for an automorphism of order 2, [formula] and c =   ±  1. Then PU = U or PU =  - U. Hence an eigenvector U is odd or even with respect to φ.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph, V = {vi | 1  ≤  i  ≤  n} (n = |V|) and [formula] a vector. We define three subsets of V as follows:

[formula]

Let L(G) be the normalized Laplacian of graph G and [formula] the second eigenvector. If [formula] then [formula] and [formula].

The vector [formula] is an eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. Since the second eigenvector U is orthogonal to [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Since [formula], there exist at least two values such that ui > 0 and uj < 0 for i  ≠  j. Hence [formula] and [formula].

Let G be a graph with an automorphism φ of order 2. Let [formula] be an eigenvector and [formula]. If [formula] and φ(U) =  - U then [formula] and [formula].

Assume [formula]. If [formula], φ(U) =  - U implies that uφ(i) > 0. This contradicts that [formula]. Similarly, if we assume that [formula] and ui  ≥  0 for [formula], then φ(U) =  - U implies that uφ(i) < 0. Then this contradicts that [formula]. If [formula], then [formula] and contradicts that [formula].

Let Pn be a weighted path graph and L(Pn) be its normalized Laplacian matrix. For any eigenvector [formula],

x1 = 0 implies X = 0,

xn = 0 implies X = 0 and,

xi = xi + 1 = 0 implies that X = 0.

For a path graph Pn, L(Pn) has n simple eigenvalues.

Let [formula] and [formula] be two eigenvectors of L(Pn) with eigenvalue λ. From the proposition [\ref=prop5], we have un  ≠  0 and ūn  ≠  0. Let [formula], where α  ≠  0. Consider [formula]. The n-th element of [formula] is (ūnun  -  ūnun) = 0. Then [formula]. Thus U and Ū are linearly dependent and hence λ is simple.

Let Pn be the path graph and φ the automorphism of order 2 defined on V(Pn). Then any second eigenvector U2 of L(Pn) is an odd vector.

Let

Minimum normalized cut of graphs

We use the term Mcut(G) to represent the minimum normalized cut. In this section, we review the basic properties of Mcut(G) and its relation to the connectivity and second smallest eigenvalue of normalized Laplacian. We derive Mcut(G) of basic classes of graphs such as paths, cycles, double trees, cycle cross paths, complete graphs and other graphs such as Rn,k, Pn,k and LPn,m.

We compute normalized cut for the following cases. Case(1) A = {1,2,3,4},B = {5,6,7},vol(A) = 12,vol(B) = 8, cut(A,B) = 2 and Ncut(A,B) = 0.417. Case(2) A = {1,2,3},B = {4,5,6,7},vol(A) = 10,vol(B) = 10, cut(A,B) = 4 and Ncut(A,B) = 0.8. Case(3) A = {1,3,4,5,6,7},B = {2},vol(A) = 2,vol(B) = 18, cut(A,B) = 2 and Ncut(A,B) = 1.1111. Comparing above 3 cases, we obtain Mcut(G) for the case(1).

So we have Mcutj'(G)  ≥  Mcutj(G) for any j'  >  j.

Let G = (V,E) be a graph with vol(G)  ≥  9. If there exists a subset A  ⊂  V such that [formula] and |vol(A) - vol(G) / 2|  ≤  3, then

[formula]

Let s = vol(G), sA = vol(A) and [formula]. Since [formula] and s = sA + sĀ, we have [formula]. Since [formula] [formula] <  9   ≤  s, we have Mcut(G) = Mcut1(G) by the Lemma [\ref=genlem4].

Let G = (V,E) be a graph and vol(G)  ≥  11. If there exists a set A  ⊂  V such that [formula] and |vol(A) - vol(G) / 2|  ≤  3, then

[formula]

Since [formula] and [formula], we have [formula] and [formula] [formula] <  11. So we have Mcut(G) =  min (Mcut1(G),Mcut2(G)) by the Lemma [\ref=genlem4].

Let G = (V,E) be a graph with vol(G)  ≥  11. Suppose there exists a subset A  ⊂  V such that [formula] and |vol(A) - vol(G) / 2|  ≤  3. If there exists no subset B  ⊂  V such that [formula] and [formula], then

[formula]

If n is even then [formula] [formula] is the minimum of [formula]. If n is odd then [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] is the minimum of [formula]. Since [formula], [formula] and [formula] [formula] [formula], we have Mcut(Cn) = Mcut1(Pn) by Lemma [\ref=genlem4].

The cycle cross path [formula] is a graph which has n copies of cycles Cm, each corresponding to the one vertex of Pn. [formula]. Case (i) Let [formula] and [formula]. We note that [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then [formula]. When n is even, [formula]. When n is odd, [formula]. Case (ii) Let [formula] and [formula]. We note that [formula] and [formula]. In this case, the graph cut horizontally through the cycles and we have [formula]. Hence [formula]. When m is odd, [formula] and when m is even, [formula].

Case (iii) Let [formula] (1  ≤  k  <  m). We note that [formula] and vol(Bk) = 3k. Since [formula] [formula], we can verify [formula] [formula] for any k and m  ≤  2n.

Case (iv) Let [formula] (1  ≤  k  <  n). We note that [formula] and vol(Ck) = 4k - 1. Since [formula] [formula] , we can verify [formula] [formula] for any k and 2n  ≤  m.

Now compare the case (i) with case (ii).

For the case of 2n  ≥  m + 1, we have [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] ≥  4m [formula] and Mcut2n(G)  >  Mcutm(G). So [formula].

If 2n  ≤  m, then we have [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] ≥  2(2n - 1) [formula] and Mcutm(G)  >  Mcut2n(G). So [formula].

The size of a tree is [formula] and the size of a double tree is |DTn| = 2|Tn| = 2n + 1 - 2. The volume of a tree is vol(Tn) = 2vol(Tn - 1) + 4, which can be written as [formula]. Therefore the volume of a tree is vol(Tn) = 2n + 1 - 4 and the volume of a double tree is [formula].

Let A1  =  {x(w) | w∈Σ<  n} and [formula]. Then we have vol(A1)  =  vol(Tn) + 1 =  2n + 1 - 3, [formula], [formula].

Therefore [formula] [formula] [formula] [formula].

Here κ'(DTn) = 1 and 2vol(A1) = vol(DTn). Then from the Proposition [\ref=minvol], [formula].

Mcut of roach type graphs Rn,k

Next, we consider the graph Rn,k and derive a formula for Mcut(Rn,k) based on n,k.

For Rn,k(n  ≥  1,k > 1), Mcut(Rn,k) is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let [formula]. Volume of Rn,k is vol(Rn,k) = 2(2n - 1 + 3k - 1) = 6k + 4n - 4. We consider the following cases in order to find the Mcut(Rn,k). Case(i) Let A1  ⊆  V(Rn,k), where [formula] and [formula]. Then the volume vol(A1) is [formula] and [formula]. So we have

[formula]

Let this value as c1. Case(ii) Let A2  ⊆  V(Rn,k) such that [formula] and [formula]. Then the volume vol(A2) = 2n - 1, [formula] and [formula]. So we have

[formula]

Let this value as c2. Case(iii) Suppose there exists |A3| < n such that [formula]. Let vol(A3) = 2n - 1 - 2x, where x = |A2| - |A3| and |A2| = n. Then [formula]. [formula]. Since 4x(1 - (3k + x)) < 0, [formula]. Since c2 is smaller than Case(iii), we can ignore this case. Case(iv) Let [formula], where 1  ≤  α < k and [formula]. Then [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then we have,

[formula]

Let this value as c4(α). Minimum of c4(α) can be obtained by differentiating with respect to α.

[formula] gives minimum value of c4(α) at [formula]. But α0 is not an integer for all n,k. If [formula] that is [formula] then the minimum value is c4(1). Then we have

[formula]

If [formula] that is [formula] then the minimum value is [formula] whenever [formula].

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula] and 3|n then the minimum value is [formula].

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula] and 2|k then the minimum value is [formula].

[formula]

If [formula] and [formula] and [formula] then the minimum value is [formula].

[formula]

Case(v) Let A5  =  {xi | 1  ≤  i  ≤  n + 1} and [formula]. Then vol(A5) = 2n + 2 and [formula]. Then we have [formula]. Now we can compare all cases considered above. If k = 2 and n = 1 then it is easy show that c1 is the minimum. If k = 2 and n  ≥  2 then it is easy to show that c2 is the minimum. If k = 3 and n = 1 then [formula] is the minimum. If k = 3 and n = 2 then [formula] is the minimum. If k = 3 and n  ≥  3 then we can easily show that c2 is the minimum. If k  ≥  4 and n = 1 then c4 is the minimum. Next we assume that k  ≥  4 and n  ≥  2. It is easy to check that c2 is smaller than c1, c3 and c5. So we compare c2 with c4 for k  ≥  4. Then we have the following results. If ( * 1 and (n  <  K1)) then [formula] is smaller than c2. If ( * 2 and (n  <  K2)) then [formula] is smaller than c2. If ( * 3 and (n  <  K3)) then [formula] is smaller than c2. If ( * 4 and (n  <  K4)) then [formula] is smaller than c2. We can summarize the results as follows.

[formula]

Finally, we want to show that for any arbitrary subset A, [formula] or [formula] gives the minimum normalized cut. We notice that every subset A with [formula] is A2 or A3 and every subset A with [formula] are A1,A5,A4. We consider all cases with [formula] and the minimum occurs at A2. There may be several partitions with [formula]. Let k  ≥  4. Then we note that vol(Rn,k)  ≥  24 and there exists a subset A4 in Case(iv), which minimize the [formula] with [formula]. We note that [formula]. From Lemma [\ref=genmcut2], [formula] for vol(Rn,k)  ≥  11. Then we can show that there is no subset A with [formula] and [formula]. This conclude that minimum Ncut always have cut value 2 for all cases which has cut size more than 1.

Figure [\ref=fig:rnk] shows the above regions for n,k. For a given Rn,k, we can find Mcut(Rn,k).

Mcut of weighted paths Pn,k

In this section, we consider a weighted path graph Pn,k and find a formula for Mcut(Pn,k) based on n,k. We consider subsets of V(Pn,k) defined by [formula] for 1  ≤  α  ≤  n + k - 1. We note that every subset A  ⊂  V(Pn,k) with [formula] is A = A(α) for some α.

Let G = Pn,k. There exists a subset A  ⊂  V(Pn,k) such that [formula] and [formula].

Since vol(Pn,k) = 2n + 3k - 2, if [formula] then vol(Pn,k)  ≥  9. By the Lemma [\ref=gencut1], we have Mcut(G) = Mcut1(G).

If [formula], we have only five cases (n,k) = (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,2) and (2,2). For each cases [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], and [formula].

Let Pn,k ([formula]) be a weighted path graph. We first note that

[formula]

where a function c(t) (1  ≤  t  ≤  n + k) is defined by

[formula]

We note that c(α - x) = c(α + x) for an integer α (1  ≤  α  ≤  n, n + 1 < α  ≤  n + k - 1) and a real number x ([formula]).

We also note vol(Ai) < vol(Ai + 1) (1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k - 2), vol(A(n)) = 2n - 1, vol(A(n + 1)) = 2n + 2 and vol(A(n + k - 1)) = 2n + 3k - 4. Since

[formula]

if [formula] then

[formula]

We consider four cases: Case (i) [formula], Case (ii) [formula], Case (iii) [formula], and Case (iv) [formula].

Case (i) Assume [formula]. That is [formula]. We find α minimizing [formula] [formula]. For such α we have

That is

[formula]

which means α is the nearest integer of [formula].

We consider three cases ([formula]), ([formula] and 2|k), and ([formula]), where [formula].

If [formula] then α = K. If [formula] then [formula] or [formula]. If [formula] and 2|k then [formula] or [formula].

Since c(α - x) = c(α + x) for an integer α (1  ≤  α  ≤  n) and a real number x ([formula]), Mcut(Pn,k) will be

[formula]

following the conditions of n and k.

Case (ii) Assume [formula]. That is [formula]. In this case

[formula]

[formula]

Case (iv) Assume [formula]. That is [formula]. We find α minimizing [formula] [formula]. For such α we have

[formula]

That is

[formula]

which means α is the nearest integer of [formula].

We consider four cases ([formula]), ([formula] and 2|k), (3|n and [formula]), and ([formula] and [formula]), where [formula].

If [formula] then α = K'. If [formula] and 2|k then [formula] or [formula]. If 3|n and [formula] then [formula] or [formula]. If [formula] and [formula] then [formula] or [formula]. Since c(K' - x) = c(K' + x) ([formula]), we have Mcut(Pn,k) as one of

[formula]

following the conditions of n and k.

We note c(K) = c(K'), [formula] and [formula] before summarizing them as a proposition.

For Pn,k,(n,k  ≥  1, [formula], Mcut(Pn,k) is given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Figure [\ref=fig:patha] shows minimum Mcut(Pn,k) for each n,k.

For P2k,k,

[formula]

By substituting n = 2k to the formula given for Mcut(Pn,k), we can directly obtain the result. According to the Theorem [\ref=pathnk], for n = 2k, k > R3 that is [formula] implies that k  ≤   - 6. Since k  ≥  1, this does not holds. For R1 < k  ≤  R2 that is [formula] implies that  - 3  ≤  k  <  0. Since k  ≥  1, this does not holds. For R2 < k  ≤  R3 that is [formula] implies that  - 6  ≤  k  <   - 3. Since k  ≥  1, this does not holds. Therefore the only case, which holds for n = 2k is, k  ≤  R1 that is [formula]. This implies that k  ≥  0. Substituting n = 2k in the Theorem [\ref=pathnk], we have,

[formula]

That is

[formula]

which means α is the nearest integer of [formula]. We consider two cases [formula] and [formula], where [formula]. If [formula] then α = K. If [formula] then [formula] is an integer and [formula] or [formula]. Since [formula], Mcut(LPn,m) will be

An eigenvalue [formula] of Q is simple.

Let [formula], u = (ui)1  ≤  i  ≤  2(n + k)∈R2(n + k) and ui = un + k + i (1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k). Then L(Rn,k)u = λu if and only if Pu = λu, where u = (ui)1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k.

Let [formula], u = (ui)1  ≤  i  ≤  2(n + k)∈R2(n + k) and ui =  - un + k + i (1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k). Then L(Rn,k)u = λu if and only if Qu = λu where u = (ui)1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k.

First, we note that Q = F- 1(2I - P)F by Lemma [\ref=lemma:ftf]. So Q and 2I - P have same eigenvalues and Fu is an eigenvector of Q if and only if u is an eigenvector of P.

If λ is not simple, we can have an eigenvector u = (ui)1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k, where u1 = 0. By Pu  =  λu and [formula], we have u = 0 and it contradict that u is an eigenvector of P. So we have [formula] is simple.

It is similar to 2.

Assume L(Rn,k)u = λu, then we have Pu = λu by direct computations. The converse is also hold.

It is similar to 4.

Let n = k = 2. Then

Eigenvalues of Q are 2, 1.62867, 1, and 0.204666. Corresponding eigenvectors are

[formula]

Each eigenvector of P is corresponding to an even eigenvector of L(R2,2) and Q an odd eigenvector of L(R2,2). Even though eigenvalues of P and Q are simple, an eigenvalue 1 of L(R2,2) is not simple.

counter examples for Mcut(G)  ≠  Lcut(G)

This section present counter example graphs, on which spectral methods and minimum normalized cut produce different clusters.

Mcut(G) and Lcut(G)

Let G = (V,E) be a connected graph, λ2 the second smallest eigenvalue of L(G), U2 = ((U2)i) (1  ≤  i  ≤  |V|) a second eigenvector of L(G) with λ2. We assume that λ2 is simple. Then Lcut(G) is defined as [formula].

Figure [\ref=fig:lmcut] shows some examples, where Mcut(G) = Lcut(G) and Mcut(G)  ≠  Lcut(G).

Let G = (V,E,w) be a weighted graph, W the weighted adjacency matrix of G, L the weighted difference Laplacian L(G) of G, and A a subset of V. If vector [formula] is defined as

[formula]

then

[formula],

yTDy = vol(V) and

[formula].

This can be further reduced to,

By Proposition [\ref=prop25], we have

[formula]

where z = D1 / 2y and L(G) = I - D- 1 / 2WD- 1 / 2. The least eigenvalue of L(G) is 0 and an eigenvector is [formula]. Let λ2 be the second eigenvalue of L(G). It is well known

[formula]

If z is a second eigenvector, then [formula] and [formula]. These results guide to consider relations between a set A attaining [formula] and a set V+(U), where U is a second eigenvector of L(G). The set V+(U) is a good approximation of A.

The graph Rn,k

In this section, we review the formulae of Mcut(Rn,k) and conditions in Theorem [\ref=propmcutg], consider some properties of subsets A of V(Rn,k), which attains [formula], and assign a condition of n and k to cause [formula].

Let Rn,k = (V,E), V = {vi | 1  ≤  i  ≤  2(n + k)}, where

[formula]

We review subsets A1, A2 and A4(α) defined in the proof of Theorem [\ref=propmcutg]. That is

[formula]

For a vector [formula], we write [formula]. For a vector [formula], we write [formula] as a vector [formula] such that ui + (n + k) = ui (1  ≤  i  ≤  n + k). In this section, we consider an automorphism φ, where φ(vi) = vi + n + k to consider even and odd vectors.

If [formula] is an eigenvector of L(Rn,k) with an eigenvalue λ, then Ū is an eigenvector of L(Pn,k) with an eigenvalue λ. Conversely, if [formula] is an eigenvector of L(Pn,k) with an eigenvalue λ, then U = (Ū,Ū) is an eigenvector of L(Rn,k).

If U is an even vector then we can write U = (Ū,Ū). The matrix L(Rn,k) can be written as

[formula]

where L1 is the (n + k)  ×  (n + k) principal sub matrix of [formula] and C = (cij) is the (n + k)  ×  (n + k) matrix such that

[formula]

We notice that [formula]. If λ is an eigenvalue of L(Rn,k) then L(Rn,k)U = λU can be written as,

[formula]

This gives

[formula]

This can be written as, [formula]. Therefore λ is an eigenvalue of L(Pn,k) and Ū is an eigenvector. Thus if U is an even vector of [formula] with eigenvalue λ, then Ū is an eigenvector of [formula] with the same eigenvalue. The converse also holds.

Let [formula] be an eigenvector of L(Pn,k) with a second smallest eigenvalue λ2. Then there exists some [formula] such that [formula] and [formula] or [formula] and [formula].

If [formula] is the second eigenvector of L(Pn,k), then [formula]. Then by Lemma [\ref=lemma4], [formula] and [formula]. Since λ2 is simple, induced subgraphs by V+(U), V-(U), [formula] and [formula] are connected by the nodal domain theorem [\cite=Davis:2001]. Thus there exists some [formula] as given in the proposition.

If [formula] is a first eigenvector of L(Pn,k), then U = (Ū,Ū) is a first eigenvector of L(Rn,k).

Let λ2 be the second smallest eigenvalue of L(Rn,k), λ'2 the second smallest eigenvalue of L(Pn,k), and [formula] an eigenvector of L(Rn,k) with λ2. If U is an even vector then λ2  =  λ'2. That is [formula] is an second eigenvector of L(Pn,k) with λ'2.

Since U is an even vector, Ū is an eigenvector of L(Pn,k) with λ2. So we have λ'2  ≤  λ2. We note [formula] and [formula].

Let [formula] be a second eigenvector of L(Pn,k) with λ'2. Since (U',U') is an eigenvector of L(Rn,k) with λ'2, we have λ2  ≤  λ'2 and λ2  =  λ'2.

Let λ2 be the second eigenvalue of Rn,k, U an eigenvector of Rn,k with λ2. Since λ2 is simple, induced subgraphs by V-(U) and [formula] are connected by the nodal domain theorem [\cite=Davis:2001]. Since U is an odd vector or an even vector, it is easy to show Lemma [\ref=lemma15] and Lemma [\ref=lemma17].

Let [formula] be a second eigenvector of L(Rn,k). If U is an odd vector then

[formula]

Let [formula] be a second eigenvector of L(Rn,k). If U is an even vector then there exists α (1  ≤  α  <  k) such that

[formula]

Let G = Rn,k(n  ≥  1,k  ≥  2). If n and k belong to the following region R then Mcut(G)  <  Lcut(G).

[formula]

Let G = (V,E), K1, K2, K3 and K4 are formulae defined in the Theorem [\ref=propmcutg]. If k  ≥  2 then K2 < K3 < K4 < K1. So if (n,k)∈R then [formula] and denoted by c2 in the Theorem [\ref=propmcutg].

Let [formula] be an eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of L(Rn,k). If U is an odd vector, then [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma15]. So we have Mcut(G)  <  Lcut(G) by Theorem [\ref=propmcutg].

If U is an even vector, then [formula] for some α by Lemma [\ref=lemma17]. So we have Mcut(G)  <  Lcut(G) by Theorem [\ref=propmcutg].

Let k  ≥  3, λ2(L(P2k,k)), λ2(L(P4k)), and λ2(L(R2k,k)) the second eigenvectors of L(P2k,k), L(P4k), and L(R2k,k), respectively.

λ2(L(P4k))  <  λ2(L(P2k,k)).

λ2(L(R2k,k))  <  λ2(L(P4k)).

A second eigenvector U of L(R2k,k) is an odd vector.

The second eigenvalue of L(R2k,k) is simple.

Mcut(R2k,k) < Lcut(R2k,k).

Since λ2(L(P4k)) [formula] by Proposition [\ref=prop:path], we have λ2(L(P4k)) <  λ2(L(P2k,k)) by Proposition [\ref=propO3].

Let A = (aij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  4k be the adjacency matrix of P4k, B = (bij)1  ≤  i,j  ≤  6k be the adjacency matrix of R2k,k, d = (di)1  ≤  i  ≤  4k, where [formula], e = (ei) where [formula], and x = (xi)1  ≤  i  ≤  4k an eigenvector of L(P4k) corresponding to λ2(L(P4k)) with xTx = 1. We note that [formula] and λ2(L(P4k))  =  xTL(P4k)x [formula]. Let

[formula]

and consider a vector y = (yi)1  ≤  i  ≤  6k. Since x is a second eigenvector of L(P4k), we have [formula], [formula], and [formula]. So we have yTy = 1, [formula], and

[formula]

If a second eigenvector U of L(R2k,k) corresponding to λ2(L(R2k,k)) is an even vector, then λ2(L(R2k,k)) = λ2(L(P2k,k)) by Proposition [\ref=prop:evenpnk]. But it contradicts that λ2(L(R2k,k)) < λ2(L(P2k,k)) induced by 1. and 2. So we have a second eigenvector U of L(R2k,k), which is an odd vector.

By 3. and Proposition [\ref=prop:evenpnk], 3. and 4., λ2(L(R2k,k)) is simple.

Since the second eigenvector of R2k,k is an odd vector, [formula] by Lemma [\ref=lemma15]. Thus we have Mcut(R2k,k)  <  Lcut(R2k,k) by Theorem [\ref=propmcutg].

Conclusion

We presented a survey of the known results associated with difference, normalized, and signless Laplacian matrices. We also stated upper and lower bounds for the difference and normalized Laplacian matrices using isoperimetric numbers and the Cheeger constant. We gave a uniform proof for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of paths and cycles on the basis of all three Laplacian matrices using circulant matrices, and presented an alternate proof for finding the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of cycles and paths using Chebyshev polynomials. We also introduced concrete formulae for Mcut(G) for some classes of graphs. Then, we established characteristic polynomials for the normalized Laplacian matrices L(Pn,k) and L(Rn,k). Finally, we presented counter example graphs based on Rn,k, where Mcut(G) and Lcut(G) produce different clusters. In particular, we established criteria for Mcut(G) and Lcut(G) to have different values.
