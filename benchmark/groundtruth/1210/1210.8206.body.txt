Tiling Branching Multiplicity Spaces with GL2 Pattern Blocks

Introduction

Branching rules describe a way of decomposing an irreducible representation of a whole group into irreducible representations of a subgroup. With applications in physics, branching rules for classical groups have been extensively studied. See, for example, [\cite=Ki75] [\cite=KT90] [\cite=Pr94] [\cite=Wh65].

In this paper, we study combinatorial aspects of branching rules for complex classical groups, under the restriction of GLn to GLn - 2, Sp2n to Sp2n - 2, and SOm to SOm - 2, by investigating the GL2 module structure of branching multiplicity spaces. Recently, Wallach, Yacobi and the current author studied Sp2n to Sp2n - 2 branching rules in terms of SL2 representations [\cite=KY11] [\cite=WY09] [\cite=Ya10]. Our results for the symplectic group are compatible with the ones in the above papers once we restrict GL2 to SL2.

A group homomorphism φα from the complex torus [formula] to [formula] defined by is called a polynomial dominant weight of the complex general linear group [formula], if it satisfies We shall identify the polynomial dominant weight φα with the exponent α. We can also identify φα with Young diagram having αi boxes in the ith row for all i. The sum [formula] will be denoted by |α|.

Then, by theory of highest weight, polynomial dominant weights uniquely label complex irreducible polynomial representations of the general linear group, and we will let Vαk denote the irreducible representation of GLk labeled by Young diagram α, or equivalently, highest weight α. See, for example, [\cite=GW09].

The irreducible representation Vλn of GLn labeled by Young diagram λ is completely reducible as a GLn - 2 representation. By Schur's lemma (for example, [\cite=FH91]), for a pair of polynomial dominant weights λ and μ of GLn and GLn - 2 respectively, the branching multiplicity of Vμn - 2 in Vλn is equal to the dimension of the space

[formula]

of GLn - 2 homomorphisms, and then, as a GLn - 2 representation, Vλn decomposes into isotypic components as

[formula]

where the summation runs over the highest weights μ of Vμn - 2 appearing in Vλn. In this sense, we call the space [\eqref=multi-space] a GLn to GLn - 2 branching multiplicity space.

After a brief review on the representations of GL2 in Section [\ref=sec-GL2], we describe the GL2 module structure of GLn to GLn - 2 branching multiplicity spaces in Section [\ref=sec-character]. We develop a combinatorial procedure of tiling branching multiplicity spaces with GL2 pattern blocks in Section [\ref=sec-tiling]. This procedure will show, in particular, how combinatorics of GL2 representations can be intertwined to make branching rules under the restriction of GLn to GLn - 2. We will discuss analogous results for the branching of Sp2n to Sp2n - 2 and SOm to SOm - 2 in Section [\ref=sec-other].

Irreducible Representations of GL2

In this section, we review algebraic and combinatorial models for GL2 representations.

For a polynomial dominant weight [formula] of GL2, the irreducible representation with highest weight (x,z) can be realized as

[formula]

where g∈GL2 acts on the spaces [formula] and [formula] via scaling by the factor of det(g)z and matrix multiplication, respectively. Here, [formula] denotes the dth symmetric power of the space [formula], and det(g) denotes the determinant of the matrix g∈GL2. See, for example, [\cite=FH91].

The irreducible representations of GLk can be described in terms of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns [\cite=GT50]. For GL2, Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns for V(x,z)2 are triangular arrays of the form with [formula] and x  ≥  y  ≥  z, which can label weight basis vectors v∈V(x,z)2 for all diagonal matrices diag(t1,t2) of GL2. See, for example, [\cite=GW09] or [\cite=Mo06]. Then, the character of the GL2 representation V(x,z)2 is

[formula]

where the summation runs over all integers y such that x  ≥  y  ≥  z, or equivalently, over all Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns with top row (x,z).

We remark that if we restrict GL2 down to its subgroup SL2, then V(x,z)2 is isomorphic to [formula]. Its character can be given as, by taking t1 = t and t2  =  t- 1 in ([\ref=GL2-character]), where d = x - z. See, for example, [\cite=FH91] or [\cite=GW09].

Branching Multiplicity Spaces

In this section, we study the GL2 module structure of GLn to GLn - 2 branching multiplicity spaces.

Let us recall branching rules for GLk down to GLk - 1, under the embedding of GLk - 1 in the upper left corner of GLk. For polynomial dominant weights α and β of GLk and GLk - 1, respectively, we write [formula] and say β interlaces α, if

Let α and β be polynomial dominant weights of GLk and GLk - 1, respectively.

The multiplicity of a GLk - 1 irreducible representation Vβk - 1 in Vαk, as a GLk - 1 representation, is at most one. It is precisely one, when β interlaces α.

As a GLk - 1  ×  GL1 representation, Vαk decomposes as where the summation runs over all β interlacing α.

Next, let us consider polynomial dominant weights λ and μ of GLn and GLn - 2, respectively. We say μ doubly interlaces λ, if there exists a polynomial dominant weight κ of GLn - 1 such that μ interlaces κ and κ interlaces λ, i.e., [formula]. By applying the above lemma twice, it is straightforward to see that

The irreducible representation Vμn - 2 appears in Vλn as a GLn - 2 representation if and only if μ doubly interlaces λ.

The multiplicity of Vμn - 2 in Vλn is equal to the number of all possible κ's satisfying [formula].

As a GLn - 2  ×  GL1  ×  GL1 representation, Vλn decomposes as where the summation runs over all μ doubly interlacing λ and κ satisfying [formula].

By comparing [\eqref=isotypic] and Proposition [\ref=GL-one-one], we can describe the branching multiplicity space in terms of integral sequences κ such that [formula], or arrays of the form where the entries are weakly decreasing along the diagonals from left to right, which we will call interlacing patterns.

Our next task is to show that every GLn to GLn - 2 branching multiplicity space can be factored into GL2 representations. For polynomial dominant weights λ and μ of GLn and GLn - 2 respectively, let (λ,μ) be the set of interlacing patterns whose top and bottom rows are λ and μ respectively. Also, for a sequence σ of weakly decreasing nonnegative integers let (σ) be the set of all (n - 1)-tuples of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns for GL2 whose top rows are (σ2i - 1,σ2i) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1.

Let λ and μ be polynomial dominant weights of GLn and GLn - 2, and σ  =  σ(λ,μ) be the sequence [formula] obtained by rearranging the sequence in weakly decreasing order, i.e., [formula]. Then, the map from (λ,μ) to (σ) sending to is a bijection.

We will prove the theorem in the context of pattern-tiling in Proposition [\ref=gluing]. Our proof will show in particular how combinatorics of GL2 representations are intertwined to make branching rules under the restriction of GLn to GLn - 2. We also note that a direct proof can be given by using the observation that if μ doubly interlaces λ, then x1  =  λ1, zn - 1  =  λn, and

[formula]

for 1  ≤  j  ≤  n - 2.

As an immediate consequence of Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling], since there are exactly (x - z + 1) possible Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns with top row (x,z), we have

For μ doubly interlacing λ, the multiplicity of Vμn - 2 in Vλn, or equivalently, the dimension of the branching multiplicity space Vλ|μ is where xj's and zj's are defined from the rearrangement [formula] of the sequence [formula] in weakly decreasing order.

We note that this formula can be derived from [\cite=Ya10]. See the remark after Theorem [\ref=thm-GL2].

In the setting of Proposition [\ref=GL-one-one], consider the diagonal block GL2 complement to GLn - 2 in GLn: where g1∈GLn - 2 and g2∈GL2. Then, this GL2 commutes with GLn - 2 acting on Vμn - 2 in [\eqref=isotypic], and therefore, the GLn to GLn - 2 branching multiplicity space carries the structure of a GL2 module.

For μ doubly interlacing λ, the GLn to GLn - 2 branching multiplicity space Vλ|μ is, as a GL2 representation, isomorphic to the tensor product of GL2 irreducible representations where [formula] is the one-dimensional representation given by det(g)- |μ| for g∈GL2; and xj and zj are defined from the rearrangement [formula] of the sequence [formula] in weakly decreasing order.

By taking GL1  ×  GL1 in Proposition [\ref=GL-one-one] as a maximal torus of GL2, we can consider the following formula as the GL2 character of the branching multiplicity space where (t1,t2)∈GL1  ×  GL1 and the summation runs over all κ such that [formula]. Then,

[formula]

and, by Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling], we have xj  ≥  κj  ≥  zj for each j. This shows that ch(Vλ|μ) is the product of (t1t2)- |μ|, the character of the one dimensional representation twisted by det(g)- |μ|, and the characters of V(xj,zj)2's. This finishes our proof.

The following SL2 module structure of the branching multiplicity space was studied by Yacobi in his thesis. See [\cite=Ya10]. Our theorem can be understood as a result obtained by lifting SL2 to GL2.

Tiling Branching Multiplicity Spaces

In this section, we develop a combinatorial procedure of tiling branching multiplicity spaces with Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns for GL2, thereby proving Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling].

First, in order to consider some directed paths in a graph, we place vertices on the coordinate plane as For example, P7 is

Then, we consider directed paths from u = (1,0) to v = (n,0) on (2n - 3) steps visiting each point in Pn exactly once, when we are only allowed to move right(→  ) or up([formula]) or down([formula]) or up-right([formula]) or down-right([formula]) at each step.

These are two paths for P6 out of 16 possible ones.

Each directed path can be presented by a sequence of allowed steps. For example, the two paths for P6 in Example [\ref=fig-path] can be presented as, respectively,

[formula]

At each step of a path, it is clear whether we are on the line y = 0 or the line y =  - 1; and if we are on y = 0 then the next step should be down([formula]), and if we are on y =  - 1 then the next step should be up([formula]). Therefore, in presenting directed paths for Pn from (1,0) to (n,0), we may omit up([formula]) and down([formula]) arrows. Then, by denoting moving right(→  ) on the line y = 0 and on the line y =  - 1 by harpoon-up([formula]) and harpoon-down([formula]), respectively, we can present every path uniquely with the following 4 arrows:

From this observation, we define pattern blocks attached to arrows and a tiling given by a directed path.

For each i with 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1, the ith pattern block corresponding to the down-right, harpoon-up, harpoon-down and up-right arrows are

[formula] [formula] [formula] [formula] xi xi zi zi yi yi yi yi zi xi zi xi

For each directed path from (1,0) to (n,0) of Pn, its tiling is the concatenation of pattern blocks defined by the sequence of arrows presenting the path such that

yi is at coordinate (i + 0.5, - 0.5);

xi and zi above yi are at coordinates (i,0) and (i + 1,0), respectively;

xi and zi below yi are at coordinates (i, - 1) and (i + 1, - 1), respectively

for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1.

With this definition, the two paths given in Example [\ref=fig-path] can be presented as and the corresponding tilings are and respectively.

For each tiling, we identify two subsequences of [formula]. Let [formula] be the subsequence on the line y = 0; and [formula] be the be the subsequence on the line y =  - 1. In the above example, λ and μ are, respectively,

[formula]

We note that, with the order [formula], the entries of the sequences λ and μ satisfy the identities [\eqref=min-max].

The following proposition shows that the tiling procedure given in Definition [\ref=arrow-table] provides the correspondence stated in Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling].

For a given tiling, let us impose the following order on the entries xi's and zi's of pattern blocks and let λ and μ be its subsequences placed on the lines y = 0 and y =  - 1, respectively. If yi satisfies xi  ≥  yi  ≥  zi for each pattern block, then [formula], i.e., for all r and s,

Conversely, let an interlacing pattern be given. If we place its entries λi, μj and yk on coordinates (i,0), (j + 1, - 1) and (k + 0.5, - 0.5) for all i, j and k, then we obtain a tiling defined by the directed path connecting λi's and μj's in weakly decreasing order. That is, if [formula] is the rearrangement of the sequence [formula] in weakly decreasing order, then xi, yi and zi form a pattern block and satisfy for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n - 1.

It is enough to check out the inequalities for all possible two consecutive pattern blocks in a tiling listed below. Note that these are also all possible partial interlacing patterns with two triples (x,y,z) and (x',y',z').

In the first case, (λ1,λ2) = (x,x') and (μ1,μ2) = (z,z'). With x  ≥  z  ≥  x'  ≥  z', we have x  ≥  y  ≥  z and x'  ≥  y'  ≥  z' if and only if In the second case, (λ1,λ2,λ3) = (x,x',z') and μ1 = z. With x  ≥  z  ≥  x'  ≥  z', we have x  ≥  y  ≥  z and x'  ≥  y'  ≥  z' if and only if The rest of the cases can be shown similarly.

We give an example illustrating tiling procedures, and therefore showing the GL2 module structure of branching multiplicity spaces. Let us consider polynomial dominant weights (xi,zi)∈{(8,5),(4,2),(1,0)} of GL2, and Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns where [formula] varies for xi  ≥  yi  ≥  zi for all i.

In order to assemble these GL2 pattern blocks to build GL4 to GL2 branching multiplicity spaces, we consider all the directed paths for P4. They can be presented as, by using down-right, up-right, harpoon-up and harpoon-down arrows,

Then, from Definition [\ref=arrow-table], we obtain the tilings corresponding to the branching multiplicity spaces which are, by Theorem [\ref=thm-GL2], as GL2 representations, isomorphic to where g∈GL2 acts on [formula] by det(g)- 5, det(g)- 6, det(g)- 6 and det(g)- 7, respectively.

We note that if some of the entries in the sequence [formula] are equal, then different paths may give the same tiling, and therefore the same branching multiplicity space.

Branching Multiplicity Spaces of Other Classical Groups

As in the case of the general linear group, we can study the GL2 module structure of branching multiplicity spaces for the symplectic group. We can also obtain similar results for the orthogonal group within certain stable ranges. For more about stable range conditions in branching rules for classical groups, we refer readers to [\cite=K12].

By Sp2n and SOm, we denote the complex symplectic group of rank n and the complex special orthogonal group of rank ⌊m / 2⌋, respectively. The dominant weights of Sp2n and SO2n + 1 are of the form [formula] with [formula]; and the dominant weights of SO2n are of the same form with [formula].

We will state branching rules for individual cases (see, for example, [\cite=FH91] or [\cite=GW09]) with the convention of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, i.e. the entries in each array are weakly decreasing along the diagonals from left to right.

Let Wλ2n be the irreducible representation of Sp2n with highest weight λ. Then for a dominant weight μ of Sp2n - 2, the multiplicity of Wμ2n - 2 in Wλ2n as a Sp2n - 2 representation is equal to the number of Sp2n dominant weights κ such that

Note that we can identify this Sp2n to Sp2n - 2 branching rule with the GLn + 1 to GLn - 1 branching rule in Proposition [\ref=GL-one-one]. Therefore, as GL2 representations, we have where [formula] (See [\cite=Ya10]). Then, we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling] to tile the Sp2n to Sp2n - 2 branching multiplicity space with GL2 pattern blocks. From Theorem [\ref=thm-GL2], we can express the branching multiplicity space as a tensor product of GL2 representations. Also, by restricting GL2 to its subgroup SL2 and using the explanation in Section [\ref=SL2GL2], we can obtain the SL2 module structure of the branching multiplicity space.

We remark that Wallach and Yacobi studied Sp2n to Sp2n - 2 branching multiplicity spaces with Sp2  =  SL2 and n copies of SL2's in [\cite=WY09] [\cite=Ya10], and Yacobi and the current author studied their algebraic and combinatorial properties in [\cite=KY11].

Let Wλ2n + 1 be the irreducible representation of SO2n + 1 with highest weight λ. Then for a dominant weight μ of SO2n - 1, the multiplicity of Wμ2n - 1 in Wλ2n + 1 as a SO2n - 1 representation is equal to the number of dominant weights κ of SO2n such that

Note that if μn - 1 = 0, then the interlacing condition makes κn = 0 and this branching rule becomes exactly the same as the GLn to GLn - 2 branching rule in Proposition [\ref=GL-one-one]. Therefore, if μn - 1 = 0, as GL2 representations, where [formula]. Similarly, if λn = 0, as GL2 representations, where [formula]. Then, we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling] and Theorem [\ref=thm-GL2] to tile the SO2n + 1 to SO2n - 1 branching multiplicity space with GL2 pattern blocks and to factor it into GL2 representations or SL2 representations.

Let Wλ2n be the irreducible representation of SO2n with highest weight λ. Then for a dominant weight μ of SO2n - 2, the multiplicity of Wμ2n - 2 in Wλ2n as a SO2n - 2 representation is equal to the number of SO2n - 1 dominant weights κ such that

If μn - 2 = 0, then the interlacing condition makes κn - 1  =  λn  =  μn - 1 = 0 and this branching rule becomes exactly the same as the GLn - 1 to GLn - 3 branching rule in Proposition [\ref=GL-one-one]. Therefore, if μn - 2 = 0, then, as GL2 representations, where [formula] and [formula]. Similarly, if λn - 1 = 0, then κn - 1  =  λn  =  μn - 1 = 0 and as GL2 representations, where [formula] and [formula]. Then, we can apply Theorem [\ref=thm-tiling] and Theorem [\ref=thm-GL2] to tile the SO2n to SO2n - 2 branching multiplicity space with GL2 pattern blocks and to factor it into GL2 representations or SL2 representations.
