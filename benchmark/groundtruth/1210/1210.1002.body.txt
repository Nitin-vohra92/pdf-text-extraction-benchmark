Partial covers of [formula]

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the n-dimensional projective space over the finite field [formula] with q elements, where q = ph, p prime, h  ≥  1. We denote the number of points in [formula] by θn, i.e., [formula].

Let C be a family of q + a hyperplanes of [formula]. Denote by C(P) the set of hyperplanes of C containing P. A (q + a)-cover C of [formula] is a family C of q + a different hyperplanes in [formula] such that [formula]. A partial (q + a)-cover S is a set of q + a hyperplanes such that there is at least one point Q in [formula] such that |S(Q)| = 0. A point H for which |S(H)| = 0, is called a hole of S. We denote the set of holes of S by [formula].

A blocking set of [formula] is a set B of points such that each hyperplane of [formula] contains at least one point of B. A blocking set B is called trivial if it contains a line of [formula]. If a hyperplane contains exactly one point of a blocking set B in [formula], it is called a tangent hyperplane to B, and a point P of B is called essential when it belongs to a tangent hyperplane to B. A blocking set B is called minimal when no proper subset of B is also a blocking set, i.e., when each point of B is essential.

It is clear that a cover of [formula] is a dual blocking set. Dualizing the above definitions yields that a cover C is called trivial if it contains all hyperplanes through a certain (n - 2)-space and minimal if no proper subset of C is a cover. A hyperplane π is essential to a cover C if there is a point P∈π such that C(P) = {π}.

The following reducibility results will be used throughout this article.

In Theorem [\ref=hulp2], we extend the following result of Blokhuis and Brouwer to general dimension. Finally, for q a prime, we use the following result, proven by Blokhuis [\cite=B] for n = 2.

Partial covers of [formula]

Throughout this section, S will denote a partial (q + a)-cover of [formula], with 0  ≤  a  ≤  (q - 10) / 4, q > 13.

If ||  ≤  q + a, then ||  ≤  q, and the holes are collinear.

Let || = x. Suppose that there are three non-collinear points in [formula], otherwise the theorem is proven. The set [formula] can be covered by at most (x + 1) / 2 lines, denote the set of these lines by L. Let L' be the minimal cover of [formula] contained in L. The set [formula] is a cover in [formula]. Since the size of [formula] is at most q + a + (q + a + 1) / 2  ≤  2q, there is a unique minimal cover C contained in [formula] (Result [\ref=unique]).

Let [formula] be a y-secant to [formula] with y  ≤  (q - 3a - 1) / 2. Interchanging [formula] by y other lines gives, together with the lines of S, another cover C', with [formula]. Hence, by the unique reducibility property, there is a unique minimal cover contained in [formula], hence in [formula]. This minimal cover does not contain [formula], hence L' contains only lines with at least (q - 3a - 1) / 2 holes.

If || = 1, then the theorem is proven. Remark that if there is only one long secant and there are q holes, then a = 0.

Suppose that || = z. These z secants, together with the q + a lines of S, form a cover C''. Then there is a line L in L' with less than [formula] holes. Suppose to the contrary that any line in L' contains at least [formula] holes, then there are at least [formula] holes, a contradiction. We construct a new cover by replacing this line L with less than [formula] lines, one through each hole on L. In total, with the z secants and the lines of S, this set of lines constitutes a cover C''' of size at most [formula]. If

[formula]

the unique reducibility property (Result [\ref=unique]) shows that there is a minimal cover contained in [formula], which does not contain the line L. This implies that the line L was not essential to the cover C'', a contradiction. It is easy to check that for z  ≥  2 and z < 9, inequality ([\ref=vgl]) holds for a  ≤  (q - 10) / 4 and q > 13. Hence, there are at least 9 long secants essential to the minimal cover C''. On each of these secants, there are at least (q - 3a - 1) / 2 holes, hence we have at least [formula] holes. But

[formula]

if a < (7q - 63) / 25. Since a  ≤  (q - 10) / 4, and (q - 10) / 4 < (7q - 63) / 25, the theorem follows.

Let q be a prime. If ||  ≤  q + a, then S consists of q lines through the same point R and a lines [formula], not through R.

It follows from Theorem [\ref=st1] that the holes are contained in one line, say M. Then the lines of S, together with M, constitute a cover C of size q + a + 1 < 3(q + 1) / 2. Result [\ref=blokhuis], together with Result [\ref=unique], shows that the unique minimal cover contained in C is the set of all lines through a point R. It is clear that the line M is one of the lines through R. The other a lines are random, but do not contain R.

Partial covers of [formula]

Before extending the results of Section [\ref=s1] to general dimension, we need the extension of Result [\ref=hulp].

The number of tangent hyperplanes through an essential point of a blocking set B of size q + a + 1, |B|  ≤  2q, in [formula] is at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2.

The arguments of this proof are based on the proof of Proposition 2.5 in [\cite=SzW].

For n = 2, Result [\ref=hulp] proves this theorem. Assume by induction that the theorem holds for all dimensions i  ≤  n - 1. Let B be a blocking set in [formula]. Since |B|  ≤  2q, there is an (n - 2)-space L in π that is skew to B. Let H be a hyperplane through L. Embed π in [formula]. Let P be a [formula], skew to π, in [formula]. Then 〈B,P〉, the cone with vertex P and base B, is a blocking set with respect to the (n - 1)-spaces of [formula]. Let [formula] be a hyperplane through L only sharing one point Q with B. Since |B| is at most 2q, there are at least 2 tangent hyperplanes through L, hence [formula] can be chosen different from H.

Let S be a regular (n - 2)-spread through L and 〈Q,P〉 in W, the (2n - 3)-dimensional space spanned by L and 〈Q,P〉. Using the André-Bruck-Bose construction (see [\cite=Br]), this yields a projective plane [formula]. The arguments of [\cite=SzW] show that H defines a line [formula] in ΠW, only having essential points of the blocking set [formula] of size 1 + (q + a)qn - 2 = qn - 1 + aqn - 2 + 1, where [formula] is the blocking set in [formula], corresponding to 〈B,P〉. This number of points comes from 〈Q,P〉 at infinity, which is one point of the blocking set, and the q + a affine points Ri of B, all on a cone 〈Ri,P〉 with qn - 2 affine points. Result [\ref=hulp] shows that any essential point of [formula] lies on at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2 tangent lines to the blocking set [formula] in ΠW. We will show that the number of tangent lines through an essential point of the blocking set [formula] in ΠW is a lower bound on the number of tangent hyperplanes through an essential point of B in [formula].

A tangent line through an affine essential point R of [formula] corresponds to an (n - 1)-space 〈R,Ω〉, with Ω a spread element of S. The space 〈R,Ω〉 is not necessarily a tangent hyperplane to B in [formula]. Note that Ω  ≠  〈Q,P〉, since both are spread elements and cannot coincide since 〈Q,P〉 is an element of the blocking set, hence 〈R,Q,P〉 cannot be a tangent space.

The projection of 〈R,Ω〉 from P onto [formula] is an (n - 1)-dimensional space through R in [formula] which is skew to Q since [formula], and which only has R in common with B since [formula]. Hence, this projection is a tangent (n - 1)-space through R to B in [formula]. So we have shown that any tangent line in R to [formula] gives rise to a tangent hyperplane to B in R. If any tangent line to [formula] in R gives rise to a different tangent hyperplane to B, the theorem is proven.

Let η be a tangent hyperplane to B in R which is the projection of two tangent lines 〈Ω,R〉 and 〈Ω',R〉. The dimension of 〈η,P〉 is 2n - 3, and [formula]. A hyperplane of [formula] contains exactly one element of a regular (n - 2)-spread. Since it contains Ω and Ω', Ω  =  Ω'. So η is the projection of at most one such (n - 1)-space.

For every essential point Q of B, it is possible to select a tangent hyperplane H through Q, and to let this tangent hyperplane H play the role described in the preceding paragraph. Since Q is an affine essential point, this implies that Q lies in at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2 tangent hyperplanes to B.

Let S be a partial (q + a)-cover of [formula], a < q. If all holes of S are contained in a hyperplane π of [formula], then ||  ≥  qn - 1 - aqn - 2.

The hyperplanes of S, together with the hyperplane π that contains all holes, form a cover of size q + a + 1, in which π is an essential hyperplane. Dualizing gives a blocking set B of size q + a + 1, where the dual of π is an essential point. Theorem [\ref=hulp2] shows that the dual of π lies on at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2 tangent hyperplanes to B. Dualizing again shows that π contains at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2 points that are only covered by π. Removing π shows that there are at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2 holes.

The lower bound in Lemma [\ref=gev] is sharp. Let S be the set of q hyperplanes through a fixed (n - 2)-space πn - 2. Let H be the hyperplane through πn - 2, which is not chosen. Take [formula] hyperplanes for which the (n - 2)-dimensional intersections with H are all distinct and go through a common (n - 3)-space of πn - 2, then there are exactly qn - 1 - aqn - 2 holes.

From now on, S denotes a partial (q + a)-cover of [formula], n  ≥  3. We denote the following property by (Ax):

If S is a partial (q + b)-cover in [formula], b  ≤  x < (q - 2) / 3, with at most q + b holes, then q - b  ≤  ||  ≤  q and the holes are collinear.

Note that we have shown in Theorem [\ref=st1] and Lemma [\ref=gev] that the property (Ax) holds for x  ≤  (q - 10) / 4, q > 13.

Assume (Ax) for all x  ≤  a. If a partial cover [formula] of [formula] contains 3 non-collinear holes, then |S'|  >  q + a.

If |S'| = q + a, this follows immediately from property (Ax). So suppose that |S'| = q + x', x' < a, and that there are 3 non-collinear holes, say H1,H2,H3. Let P be a point not on H1H2, H1H3, or H2H3. Adding a - x' lines through P, different from PH1, PH2, PH3, to the partial cover S' gives a cover S'', with |S''| = q + a. Applying property (Ax) to S'', the corollary follows.

Assume (Ax) for all x  ≤  a, and |H§|  ≤  qn - 1. A line that contains 2 holes of S, contains at least a + 3 holes of S.

Let L be a line with t holes, t < q - a, and let π be a plane through L. Assumption (Ax) shows that if π contains at most q + a holes, there are at least q - a holes, which are all collinear, a contradiction. Hence, every plane through L contains at least q + a + 1 holes, which implies that there are at least

[formula]

holes in [formula], which has to be at most qn - 1. If t = a + 2, θn - 2(q + a + 1 - a - 2) + a + 2 > qn - 1, a contradiction. Hence, t is at least a + 3.

Assume (Ax) for all x  ≤  a, and |H§|  ≤  qn - 1. Every hole of S lies on more than qn - 2 / 2 lines with at least q - a holes.

Let R be a hole. There is a line L through R containing only covered points and R, otherwise there would be at least θn - 1 + 1 holes. Using assumption (Ax) and Lemma [\ref=nieuw], we see that a plane through L contains either at most q - 1 holes on a line through R, different from L, or it contains at least q + x holes different from R.

Suppose that there are X planes through L with at most q - 1 holes different from R. Using assumption (Ax) and Lemma [\ref=nieuw], we see that the number of holes is at least

[formula]

which has to be at most qn - 1. Putting X = qn - 2 / 2 yields a contradiction. Hence, there are more than qn - 2 / 2 planes with at most q holes. Again using assumption (Ax), we see that in each of these planes, there is a line through R containing at least q - a - 1 other holes, and all holes in such a plane lie on this line.

Assume (Ax) for all x  ≤  a, and |H§|  ≤  qn - 1. Then the holes of S are contained in one hyperplane of [formula].

For n = 2, this is assumption (Ax) with x = a. Suppose by induction that this theorem holds for any dimension i  ≤  n - 1.

First, we show that there is a hyperplane π of [formula] with at most qn - 2 holes. Let R be a hole. There is a line L through R containing only covered points and R. Suppose that all planes through L contain more than q holes, then there would be at least θn - 2q + 1 holes, a contradiction. Suppose that there is a d-dimensional space πd with at most qd - 1 holes. Then there is a (d + 1)-dimensional space containing πd with at most qd holes. Otherwise, the number of holes would be at least θn - d - 1(qd + 1 - qd - 1) + qd - 1, a contradiction if d  ≤  n - 1. Hence, by induction, there is a hyperplane π of [formula] with at most qn - 2 holes.

Using the induction hypothesis, all holes in π are contained in an (n - 2)-dimensional space πn - 2 of π. Moreover, Lemma [\ref=gev] shows that the number of holes in πn - 2 is at least qn - 2 - aqn - 3.

There are at least θn - 2(q - a - 1) + 1 holes in [formula] since every plane through L contains at least q - a - 1 extra holes. Hence, there is certainly a hole R' that is not contained in πn - 2.

Now we distinguish between two cases.

Case 1: All lines through R' with at least q - a holes are lines which intersect πn - 2. Lemma [\ref=lem1] shows that there are at least qn - 2 / 2 such lines. Since a line through two holes contains at least a + 3 holes (see Lemma [\ref=lem2]), counting the holes in 〈R',πn - 2〉 yields that this number is at least

[formula]

If all holes are contained in 〈R',πn - 2〉, the theorem is proven. Suppose now that not all holes are contained in the hyperplane 〈R',πn - 2〉. Let R'' be a hole not in 〈R',πn - 2〉. Connecting R'' with all the holes in 〈R',πn - 2〉 yields at least (a + 2)(qn - 2(q - a - 1) / 2 + (qn - 2 - aqn - 3 - qn - 2 / 2)(a + 2) + 1) + 1 holes, which is more than qn - 1, a contradiction.

Case 2: There is a line through R', skew to πn - 2, with at least q - a holes. This yields at least

[formula]

holes, a contradiction.

Assume (Ax) for all x  ≤  a, then the number of holes of S is at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2.

This follows immediately from Theorem [\ref=st3] and Lemma [\ref=gev].

Assume (Ax) for all x  ≤  a, and |H§|  ≤  qn - 1. If q is a prime, S consists of q hyperplanes through a common (n - 2)-space π and a other hyperplanes, not through π.

It follows from Theorem [\ref=st3] that the holes are contained in one hyperplane, say μ. Then the hyperplanes of S, together with μ, constitute a cover C of size q + a + 1 < 3(q + 1) / 2. Result [\ref=blokhuis], together with Result [\ref=unique2], shows that the unique minimal cover contained in C is the set of all hyperplanes through an (n - 2)-space π. Since this set covers [formula] entirely, the hyperplane μ is one of the hyperplanes through π. The other a hyperplanes are random, but do not contain π.

As remarked before, assumption (Ax) holds for all partial (q + a)-covers of [formula], x  ≤  (q - 10) / 4, q > 13.

However, a recent result of Blokhuis, Brouwer and Sznyi [\cite=BBS] shows that assumption (Ax) is valid for all x, where x < (q - 2) / 3. Moreover, the following example shows that the upper bound a < (q - 2) / 3 is sharp.

Let a = (q - 2) / 3 and let S be a set of q - 1 lines Li through a point P, and a + 1 other lines through a fixed point, lying on one of the lines Li. Then there are 2(q - a - 1) = q + a holes, lying on two lines.

Combining Theorems [\ref=st3], [\ref=algemeen] and Corollary [\ref=priemg2] with the result of Brouwer, Blokhuis and Sznyi, yields the following theorem.

If S is a partial (q + a)-cover of [formula], a < (q - 2) / 3, with at most qn - 1 holes, then there are at least qn - 1 - aqn - 2 holes and the holes are contained in one hyperplane. If q is a prime, S consists of q hyperplanes through a common (n - 2)-space π and a other hyperplanes, not through π.
