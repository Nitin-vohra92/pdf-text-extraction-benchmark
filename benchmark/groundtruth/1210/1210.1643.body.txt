Rank one connections on abelian varieties, II

Introduction

Let A be a complex abelian variety and L a holomorphic line bundle over A. The sheaf of holomorphic connections on L defines a torsor CL on A for the holomorphic cotangent bundle ΩA.

Let α  ,p1  ,p2  :  A  ×  A    →    A be the addition map and the projections respectively. The holomorphic line bundle

[formula]

will be considered as a holomorphic family, parametrized by A, of topologically trivial holomorphic line bundles on A. We have an ΩA-torsor ZL    →    A whose holomorphic sections over any open subset U    ⊂    A are the holomorphic families of relative holomorphic connections on L|A  ×  U.

In [\cite=BHR] it was crucially used that the two torsors CL and ZL are holomorphically, or equivalently, algebraically, isomorphic (see [\cite=BHR]). The proof of Proposition 2.1 of [\cite=BHR] was carried out by comparing the cohomological invariants associated to the torsors.

Our aim here is to give an explicit construction of a holomorphic isomorphism between the two torsors. The isomorphism is canonical in the sense that its construction does require making any choices.

We work with a compact complex torus; we do not need A to be algebraic.

A criterion for isomorphism of torsors

Let M be a connected complex manifold. Let V be a holomorphic vector bundle over M.

A V-torsor on M is a holomorphic fiber bundle p  :  Z    →    X and a holomorphic map from the fiber product

[formula]

such that

[formula], where pZ is the natural projection of Z  ×  MV to Z,

the map Z  ×  MV    →    Z  ×  MZ defined by pZ  ×  φ is an isomorphism,

φ(φ(z  ,v)  ,w)    =    φ(z  ,v + w).

A V-torsor (Z  ,p  ,φ) is called trivializable if there is a holomorphic isomorphism

[formula]

such that [formula] is the natural projection of V to M, and

[formula]

is the fiberwise addition homomorphism on V  ×  MV. A holomorphic isomorphism β satisfying the above conditions is called a trivialization of Z.

Any V-torsor Z has a C∞ section M    →    Z because the fibers of Z are contractible. It has a holomorphic section if and only if it is trivializable.

Take a V-torsor (Z  ,p  ,φ). Let

[formula]

be a C∞ section, so [formula]. Let

[formula]

be the differential of σ, where [formula] is the real tangent bundle. The almost complex structures on M and Z will be denoted by JM and JZ respectively. Let

[formula]

be the obstruction for σ to be holomorphic. Since the projection p is holomorphic, we have

[formula]

where dp is the differential of p. Hence [formula] is an element of Vx if [formula] (the vertical tangent subbundle of [formula] for p is identified with p*V). Note that [formula]. Define

[formula]

So [formula] is a smooth (0  ,1)-form with values in V. Clearly,     =    0 if and only if σ is holomorphic. Equivalently,     =    0 if and only if σ is a trivialization of Z.

Let (Z1  ,p1  ,φ1) and (Z2  ,p2  ,φ2) be two V-torsors. Let σ and τ be C∞ sections of Z1 and Z2 respectively. We have a unique C∞ isomorphism of V-torsors

[formula]

So, [formula].

If     =     (constructed as in [\eqref=e2]), then γ in [\eqref=e3] is holomorphic.

Let

[formula]

be the holomorphic fiber bundle whose fiber over any x  ∈  M is the space of all isomorphisms φ  :  (Z1)x    →    (Z2)x such that [formula] for all v  ∈  Vx. Note that we have a map

[formula]

There is a complex structure on H uniquely determined by the condition that a section of H defined over any open subset U    ⊂    M is holomorphic if the corresponding map Z1|U    →    Z2|U is holomorphic. The triple (H  ,q  ,φ) is a V-torsor, where φ|Hx  ×  Vx  : =   φx.

The map γ in [\eqref=e3] defines a C∞ section M    →    H, which will also be denoted by γ. It is straightforward to check that     =      -  . Therefore, if     =    , then     =    0. As noted before,     =    0 if and only if γ is holomorphic.

Line bundles on a complex torus

Let A be a compact complex torus. Let

[formula]

be the addition map. Let pi  :  A  ×  A    →    A, i    =    1  ,2, be the projection to the i-th factor. Take a holomorphic line bundle L over A. The holomorphic line bundle

[formula]

will be considered as a holomorphic family of holomorphic line bundles on A parametrized by A. For any x  ∈  A, consider the holomorphic line bundle

[formula]

It is topologically trivial, so Lx admits holomorphic connections.

The holomorphic cotangent bundle of A will be denoted by ΩA. Define V  : =   H0(A,  ΩA), and let

[formula]

be the trivial holomorphic vector bundle. The space of all holomorphic connections on Lx is an affine space for V. We have a V-torsor

[formula]

whose fiber over any point x  ∈  X is the space of all holomorphic connections on Lx. A holomorphic section of ZL defined over an open subset U    ⊂    A is a holomorphic family of relative holomorphic connections on L|A  ×  U. This condition determines uniquely the complex structure of ZL.

Let

[formula]

be the Atiyah exact sequence for L (see [\cite=At]); here TA is the holomorphic tangent bundle. Let

[formula]

be the dual of the Atiyah exact sequence. Let 1A be the section of OA given by the constant function 1. From [\eqref=at] it follows that

[formula]

is an ΩA-torsor. Note that the vector bundle ΩA is canonically identified with V (defined in [\eqref=v]) using the evaluation map on sections. Therefore, CL is a V-torsor on A.

The two V-torsors ZL and CL, constructed in [\eqref=z] and [\eqref=c] respectively, are canonically holomorphically isomorphic.

We will show that both ZL and CL have tautological C∞ sections.

There is a unique translation invariant, with respect to α in [\eqref=a], (1  ,1)-form ω on A representing [formula] (any translation invariant form on A is closed). There is a unique unitary complex connection [formula] on L such that the curvature of [formula] is ω. The hermitian structure on L for [formula] is determined uniquely up to multiplication by a constant positive real number. Since complex connections on L are C∞ splittings of [\eqref=at], the connection [formula] defines a C∞ section of the V-torsor CL in [\eqref=c]. Let

[formula]

be this C∞ section.

Consider the holomorphic line bundle L in [\eqref=l]. The connection [formula] on L pulls back to connections on both p*1L and α*L, and the connection on p*1L produces a connection on p*1L*. Therefore, we get a unitary complex connection on L from [formula]; this connection on L will be denoted by [formula].

For any point x  ∈  A, let [formula] be the restriction of [formula] to the line bundle Lx defined in [\eqref=x]. Since the curvature of the connection [formula] is translation invariant, the curvature of [formula] vanishes identically. Hence [formula] is a holomorphic connection on Lx. Consequently, we get a C∞ section of the V-torsor ZL in [\eqref=z]

[formula]

In view of Proposition [\eqref=prop1], to prove the theorem it suffices to show that     =    , where τ and σ are constructed in [\eqref=ta] and [\eqref=si] respectively. Note that a smooth (0  ,1)-form on M with values in V  : =   H0(A,  ΩA)    =    ΩA is a (1  ,1)-form on A.

As before, ω denotes the curvature of [formula]. It is standard that

[formula]

(it is a general expression of the curvature of a connection in terms of the splitting of the Atiyah exact sequence for the connection).

Consider the connection [formula] on L constructed above. Since the curvature of [formula] is ω, it follows immediately that the curvature of the connections on p*1L* and α*L are - p*1ω and α*ω respectively. Hence the curvature of [formula] is

[formula]

(see [\eqref=l]). For any y  ∈  A, let

[formula]

be the section of p2 defined by x    →    (y  ,x). We have

[formula]

because ω is translation invariant. From [\eqref=i] it follows that

[formula]

where τ is constructed in [\eqref=ta] (see [\eqref=e2]); the curvature [formula] is the obstruction for the C∞ family of holomorphic connections [formula] to be holomorphic. From [\eqref=i1] and [\eqref=i2] we conclude that     =    . Therefore, the proof of the theorem is complete by Proposition [\ref=prop1].

Theorem [\ref=thm1] immediately implies Proposition 2.1 of [\cite=BHR] by giving the isomorphism η in the proposition explicitly. The factor - 1 in Proposition 2.1 of [\cite=BHR] arises because CL and ZL* is being compared (instead of CL and ZL). Note that there is a natural holomorphic isomorphism δ  :  ZL    →    ZL* between the total spaces such that δ(z + v)    =    δ(z) - v for all v  ∈  V; this is because there is a natural bijection between the connections on a line bundle ζ and its dual ζ*. For the same reason, there is a holomorphic isomorphism δ'  :  CL    →    CL* between the total spaces such that δ'(z + v)    =    δ'(z) - v for all v  ∈  V.
