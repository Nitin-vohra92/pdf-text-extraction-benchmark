ON THE MATRICES OF CENTRAL LINEAR MAPPINGS

Hans Havlicek, Wien

Introduction

A linear mapping between projectively embedded Euclidean spaces is called central, if its exceptional subspace is not at infinity. Such a linear mapping is in general not decomposable into a central projection followed by a similarity. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a decomposition have been given in [\cite=Have1] for arbitrary finite dimensions; cf. also [\cite=Brau1], [\cite=Brau2], [\cite=Brau3]. However, those results do not seem to be immediately applicable on a central axonometry, i.e., a central linear mapping given via an axonometric figure. On the other hand, in a series of recent papers [\cite=Pauk1], [\cite=Szab1], [\cite=Szab2] this problem of decomposition has been discussed for central axonometries of the Euclidean 3-space onto the Euclidean plane from an elementary point of view .

Loosely speaking, the concept of central axonometry is a geometric equivalent to the algebraic concept of a coordinate matrix for a linear mapping of the underlying vector spaces. However, from the results in [\cite=Brau2] and [\cite=Have1] it is also not immediate whether or not a given matrix describes (in terms of homogeneous Cartesian coordinates) a mapping that permits the above-mentioned factorization. The aim of this communication is to give a criterion for this.

Let [formula], [formula] be finite-dimensional Euclidean vector spaces. Given a linear mapping [formula] denote by [formula] its adjoint mapping. Then [formula] is self-adjoint with eigenvalues Here r equals the rank of f and [formula]. Moreover, each eigenvalue is written down repeatedly according to its multiplicity . The positive real numbers [formula] are frequently called the singular values of f. The multiplicity of a singular value of f is defined via the multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue of [formula]. It is immediate from the singular value decomposition that f and fad share the same singular values (counted with their multiplicities). See, e.g., [\cite=Stra].

These results hold true, mutatis mutandis, when replacing f by any real matrix, say A, and fad by the transpose matrix AT.

Decompositions

When discussing central linear mappings it will be convenient to consider Euclidean spaces embedded in projective spaces. Thus let [formula] be an (n + 1)-dimensional real vector space (3  ≤  n  <    ∞  ) and [formula] one of its hyperplanes. Assume, furthermore, that [formula] is equipped with a positive definite inner product (·  ) so that [formula] is a Euclidean vector space. In the projective space on [formula], denoted by [formula], we consider the projective hyperplane [formula] as the hyperplane at infinity. The absolute polarity in [formula] is determined by the inner product on [formula]. Hence [formula] is a projectively embedded Euclidean space . Similarly, let [formula] be an m-dimensional projectively embedded Euclidean space (2  ≤  m  <  n  <    ∞  ). Given a linear mapping

[formula]

of vector spaces then the associate (projective) linear mapping

[formula]

has P( ker f) as its exceptional subspace. In the sequel we shall assume that

[formula]

or, in other words, that φ is central and surjective . Obviously, ([\ref=cen-sur]) is equivalent to

[formula]

We recall some results [\cite=Brau2], [\cite=Have1]: If [formula] is any complementary subspace of ker f in [formula], then denote by

[formula]

the projection with the exceptional subspace P( ker f) onto [formula]. The restricted mapping

[formula]

is a collineation and

[formula]

every decomposition of φ into a projection and a collineation is of this form. In the Euclidean vector space [formula] we have the distinguished subspace

[formula]

Write

[formula]

this [formula] is well-defined and surjective, since [formula] and [formula]. The subspace [formula] can be chosen with [formula] being a similarity if, and only if, the least singular value of [formula] has multiplicity ≥  2m - n + 1.

Next, we assume that [formula] is orthogonal to P( ker f). This means that [formula] or [formula]. Hence [formula] is an orthogonal central projection . It is easily seen from [\cite=Brau2] that φ permits a decomposition into an orthogonal central projection followed by a similarity if, and only if, all singular values of [formula] are equal.

Finally, we are going to show that the crucial properties of [formula] can be read off from another mapping: Denote by

[formula]

the orthogonal projection with the kernel [formula]. Then

[formula]

since pad is the natural embedding [formula]. Thus, by ([\ref=f-p]) and the results stated in Section [\ref=sect-INTRO], [formula] and [formula] have the same singular values (counted with their multiplicities). Hence, by the surjectivity of [formula] and ([\ref=f-p]), all singular values of [formula] are equal if, and only if, there exists a real number v > 0 such that

[formula]

We shall use this in the next section.

A matrix characterization

Introducing homogeneous Cartesian coordinates in [formula] is equivalent to choosing a basis [formula] of [formula] such that [formula] is an orthonormal system. The origin is given by [formula] and the unit points are [formula]. In the same manner we are introducing homogeneous Cartesian coordinates in [formula] via a basis [formula].

Proof. We read off from the top row of A that is an equation of [formula] so that [formula]. Write [formula] for the linear mapping whose coordinate matrix with respect to [formula] and [formula] equals [formula]. A straightforward calculation shows that and i.e., [formula]. Thus [formula] equals the mapping [formula] discussed above. Now the proof is completed by translating formulae ([\ref=f-p]) and ([\ref=ortho]) into the language of matrices.

We remark that ([\ref=cen-sur]) and the linear independence of [formula] are equivalent conditions.

In contrast to the results in [\cite=Pauk1], [\cite=Szab1], [\cite=Szab2], the φ-image of the origin [formula] does not appear in our characterization. On the other hand, we have In projective terms this 1-dimensional subspace of [formula] gives the principal point of the mapping φ. Exactly if the principal point of φ equals the origin [formula], then [formula] arises from A merely by deleting the top row and the leading column.
