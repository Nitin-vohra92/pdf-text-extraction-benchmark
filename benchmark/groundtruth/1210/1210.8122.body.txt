Remark

Non-maximality of known extremal metrics on torus and Klein bottle

Introduction

Let M be a closed surface and g be a Riemannian metric on M. Then the Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ acts on the space of smooth functions on M by the formula

[formula]

It is known that the spectrum of Δ is discrete and consists only of eigenvalues. Moreover, the multiplicity of any eigenvalue is finite and the sequence of eigenvalues tends to infinity. Let us denote this sequence by

[formula]

where the eigenvalues are written with their multiplicities.

For a fixed M the following quantities can be considered as functionals on the space of all Riemannian metrics on M,

[formula]

Several recent papers [\cite=EGJ] [\cite=ElSoufiIlias1] [\cite=ElSoufiIlias2] [\cite=Hersh] [\cite=JNP] [\cite=Korevaar] [\cite=LiYau] [\cite=Nadirashvili1] [\cite=Nadirashvili2] [\cite=YangYau] deal with finding supremum of these functionals in the space of all Riemannian metrics on M.

An upper bound for Λ1(M,g) in terms of genus of M was provided in the paper [\cite=YangYau] and the existence of such a bound for Λi(M,g) was shown in the paper [\cite=Korevaar]. The exact upper bounds are known for a limited number of functionals: [formula] (see [\cite=Hersh]), [formula] (see [\cite=LiYau]), [formula] (see [\cite=Nadirashvili1]), [formula] (see [\cite=EGJ] [\cite=JNP]), [formula] (see [\cite=Nadirashvili2]). We refer to the introduction to the paper [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki] for more details.

The functional Λi(M,g) depends continously on g but this functional is not differentiable. However, it is known that for an analytic deformation gt of the initial metric g there exist the left and right derivatives of Λi(M,gt) with respect to t, see e.g. the papers [\cite=ElSoufiIlias2] [\cite=BU] [\cite=Berger]. This is a motivation for the following definition.

A Riemannian metric g on a closed surface M is called an extremal metric for a functional Λi(M,g) if for any analytic deformation gt such that g0  =  g the following inequality holds,

[formula]

A metric g is called a maximal metric for a functional Λi(M,g) if for any metric h on M

[formula]

A question whether there exists smooth maximal metric is not trivial. For example there is no smooth maximal metric for [formula] (see [\cite=Nadirashvili2]).

The list of known extremal metrics is longer than the list of known exact upper bounds for Λi(M,g), but until now their maximality has not been studied. In the present paper we investigate the maximality of the known extremal metrics. The list of currently known extremal metrics follows.

Metrics on the Otsuki tori Op / q were studied in the paper [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki].

Metrics on the Lawson tori and Klein bottles τm,k were studied in the paper [\cite=PenskoiLawson].

Metrics on the surfaces m,k bipolar to Lawson surfaces were studied in the paper [\cite=Lapointe].

Metrics on the bipolar surfaces Õp / q to Otsuki tori were studied in the paper [\cite=Karpukhin].

In further description a Klein bottle is denoted by [formula].

The definitions of these surfaces are given in the following sections. The main result of the present paper is the following theorem.

There are no maximal metrics among the metrics (A)-(D) except for 3,1.

The metric on the Lawson bipolar Klein bottle 3,1 is maximal for the functional [formula], see [\cite=EGJ] [\cite=JNP].

We also prove the following proposition.

The metric on the Clifford torus is extremal for an infinite number of functionals Λi(M,g), but it is not maximal for any of them.

The extremality of the Clifford torus for an infinite number of functionals Λi(M,g) is known, but to the best of author's knowledge has not yet been published. In the present paper we fill this gap.

In the following description we use the notations K(k), E(k) and Π(n,k) for the elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind respectively, see [\cite=Friedman],

The paper is organized in the following way. In Section [\ref=bound] we prove lower bounds for [formula] and [formula]. These bounds are used throughout the paper in order to prove the non-maximality of metrics (A)-(D). In Section [\ref=Connection] we recall a connection between extremal metrics and minimal submanifolds of the unit sphere. Section [\ref=OtsukiDef] contains a discription of Otsuki tori as an SO(2)-invariant minimal submanifolds of [formula] of cohomogeneity 1. Sections [\ref=OtsukiEstimate], [\ref=LawsonEstimate], [\ref=BipLawsonEstimate], [\ref=BipOtsukiEstimate] are dedicated to estimates for extremal metrics (A)-(D) respectively and this finishes the proof of Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem]. Finally, Section [\ref=CliffordEstimate] contains the proof of Proposition [\ref=CliffordTheorem].

Lower bounds for sup Λn

The aim of this section is to prove the following proposition (compare with Corollary 4 in the paper [\cite=CE]).

One has the following inequalities,

[formula]

[formula]

where E(k) stands for the elliptic integral of the second kind.

Attaching handles due to Chavel-Feldman

Let M be a compact smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension [formula]. Let us pick two distinct points p1,p2∈M. For ε  >  0 we define

:  =   union of open geodesic balls of radius ε about p1 and p2,

[formula],

:  =  ∂Bε  =  ∂Ωε.

Here the number ε is chosen to be less than [formula] of injectivity radius of M and less than [formula] of a distance between p1 and p2 if p1 and p2 lie in the same connected component of M. We say that manifold Mε is obtained from M by adding a handle across Γε if

Ωε is isometrically embedded in Mε;

there exists a diffeomorphism [formula] such that

[formula]

Let us denote by λj and λj(ε) the Laplace spectrum of M and Mε respectively. Chavel and Feldman in their paper [\cite=ChFeld] obtained a sufficient condition for convergence λj(ε)  →  λj as ε tends to 0. In order to formulate this condition we need to give the following definition.

For any compact connected Riemannian manifold X of dimension [formula], the isoperimetric constant c1(X) is defined by

[formula]

where [formula] stands for k-dimensional Riemannian measure, and Y ranges over all compact (n - 1)-dimensional submanifolds of X such that they divide X into 2 open submanifolds X1, X2 each having boundary Y.

Assume that Mε is connected for any ε and there exists a constant c > 0 such that [formula] for all ε > 0. Then lim ε  →  0λj(ε)  =  λj for all [formula]

The assumption in the previous theorem implies [formula] by picking Y = Γε.

In the same paper existence of such Mε is verified for any surface M and almost any pair of points p1, p2.

Let M be a compact 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold, K be its Gaussian curvature and [formula]. Then [formula] is open and dense in M. Suppose that p1,p2∈ and one of the following possibilities occur:

M is connected,

M has two connected components and pi lie in different connected components.

Then Mε can be constructed so that assumption of Theorem [\ref=Ch1] holds. In particular, [formula] as ε  →  0.

Let us remark that Chavel and Feldman considered only the case of a connected manifold M. However, their arguments could be extended almost without changes to the non-connected case as stated above.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=LowerBound].

Consider the flat equilateral torus τeq. After suitable rescaling of the metric we have [formula] and λ1(τeq)  =  2. For the euclidean sphere [formula] of volume 4π one also has λ1(τeq)  =  2. Let us take n - 1 copies of [formula] denoted by Si, [formula]. Thus for [formula] we have λn(Tn)  =  2 and therefore [formula]. Consecutive application of Theorem [\ref=Ch2] yields the existance of the sequence Mε, diffeomorphic to torus, such that Λn(Mε)  →  Λn(Tn) as ε tends to 0. This observation completes the proof of the first inequality.

The second inequality can be proved in the same fashion. The only difference is that instead of τeq one has to use Lawson bipolar Klein bottle 3,1 (see Section [\ref=BipLawsonEstimate] for a defintion). It was proven in the paper [\cite=JNP] that [formula]. By a suitable rescaling of the metric on 3,1, one can assume that λ1(3,1)  =  2 and then apply construction of the previous paragraph.

Otsuki tori

Connection with minimal submanifolds of the sphere.

Let [formula] be a minimal immersion in the unit sphere with canonical metric gcan. We denote by Δ the Laplace-Beltrami operator on M associated with the metric ψ*gcan. Let us introduce the Weyl's eigenvalues counting funcion

[formula]

The following theorem provides a general approach to finding smooth extremal metrics.

Let [formula] be a minimal immersion in the unit sphere [formula] endowed with the canonical metric gcan.

Then the metric ψ*gcan on M is extremal for the functional ΛN(2)(M,g).

Therefore, one can start with minimal submanifold N of the unit sphere then compute N(2) and the metric induced on N by this immersion is extremal for the functional ΛN(2)(N,g). However, for a given minimal submanifold there is no algorithm for computing the exact value of N(2). Nevertheless, this approach was succesfully realized by Penskoi in the papers [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki] [\cite=PenskoiLawson] for metrics (A),(B) as well as by the author in the paper [\cite=Karpukhin] for metrics (D). Some ideas of this approach was partially used in the paper [\cite=Lapointe] for metrics (C).

Reduction theorem for minimal submanifolds.

Let M be a Riemannian manifold equipped with a metric g' and let G be a compact group acting on M by isometries. For every point x∈M let us denote by Gx the stability subgroup of x.

For two points x,y∈M we say that [formula] if Gx  ⊂  gGyg- 1 for some g∈G. The orbit Gx is the orbit of principal type if for any point y∈M one has [formula].

Let M* stand for the union of all orbits of principal type, then M* is an open dense submanifold of M (see [\cite=MSY]). Moreover, M* / G carries a natural Riemannian metric g defined by the formula g(X,Y)  =  g'(X',Y'), where X,Y are tangent vectors at x∈M* / G and X',Y' are tangent vectors at a point x'∈π- 1(x)  ⊂  M* such that X' and Y' are orthogonal to the orbit π- 1(x) and dπ(X') = X,  dπ(Y') = Y.

Let [formula] be a G-invariant immersed submanifold, i.e. a manifold equipped with an action of G by isometries such that g  ·  f(x)  =  f(g  ·  x) for any x∈N.

A cohomogeneity of a G-invariant immersed submanifold N is the number dim N  -  ν, where ν is the dimension of the orbits of principal type.

Let us define for x∈M* / G a volume function V(x) by the formula [formula]. Also for each integer [formula] let us define a metric [formula].

Let [formula] be a G-invariant immersed submanifold of cohomogeneity k, and let M* / G be equipped with the metric gk. Then [formula] is minimal if and only if [formula] is minimal.

Otsuki tori.

Otsuki tori were introduced by Otsuki in the paper [\cite=Otsuki]. Let us recall the concise description by Penskoi from the paper [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki]. For more details see Section 1.2 of the paper [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki]. Consider the action of SO(2) on the three-dimensional unit sphere [formula] given by the formula

[formula]

where α∈[null],

lim a  →  0 +Ω(a)  =  π / 2 and [formula].

Estimates for Λ2p - 1(Op / q).

According to the paper [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki], the metric on an Otsuki torus Op / q is extremal for the functional [formula]. The goal of this section is to prove the following proposition.

For p,q, such that (p,q) = 1 and [formula], the following inequality holds,

[formula]

In order to prove Proposition [\ref=OtsukiEstimateProp] we have to prove several auxiliary propositions.

For [formula] such that Ω(a)  =  pπ / q one has

[formula]

Let us use the notations of Proposition [\ref=PenskoiProp]. As we know,

[formula]

where c  =  2π sin a cos a. Therefore, the length of the segment on the geodesic π(Op / q) between the closest points with φ  =  a and φ  =  π / 2 - a is equal to 2πI, where

[formula]

Let us express I in terms of elliptic integrals,

Here the following changes of variables were used,

[formula]

Since the maps θ  ↦  θ  +  θ0 and θ  ↦  θ0  -  θ are isometries, the length of the geodesic π(Op / q) is equal to [formula]. By Proposition 13 from the paper [\cite=PenskoiOtsuki], Λ2p - 1(Op / q) is equal to the doubled length of the geodesic π(Op / q).

For k∈[0,1] one has the following inequality,

[formula]

Let us expand the left hand side using the definitions of E and K,

Since the integrand is negative on (0,π / 4) and positive on (π / 4,π / 2), one has

Let us introduce the notation

[formula]

The function Φ(a) is non-decreasing and Φ'(a) < 1 / 2 for any [formula]. In particular, [formula].

One has

[formula]

Remark. Let us remark that during the preparation of the manuscript inequality ([\ref=inOtsuki]) appeared in the paper [\cite=HuSong].

Let us recall the following formulae for the derivatives of elliptic integrals,

[formula]

[formula]

Let us introduce a notation [formula]. One obtains

[formula]

Now the monotonicity of the function Φ(a) follows from Proposition [\ref=MainLemma].

For the proof of the second part, let us go back to formula ([\ref=dphi]). One has

This finishes the proof of Proposition [\ref=PhiProp].

The function (2 / π)Ω(a)  -  Φ(a) is increasing on the interval [formula].

In the paper [\cite=HuSong] the following formula was proved,

[formula]

Using formulae ([\ref=dpi]) one obtains the following formula,

[formula]

Let us recall the notation [formula]. Then one has

[formula]

[formula]

Moreover, by formula ([\ref=dphi]) one has

[formula]

The inequality [formula] and Proposition [\ref=MainLemma] imply the inequality

[formula]

For [formula] one has

[formula]

Using the tables of elliptic integrals, e.g. the book [\cite=Friedman], one obtains the inequality

[formula]

The rest of the proof follows from the monotonicity of the function on the left hand side.

For [formula] one has

[formula]

By formula ([\ref=domega]) for [formula] one has In the last inequality we used the facts that K(k) is increasing function and E(k) as well as β(a) are decreasing functions. The table of the elliptic integrals in the book [\cite=Friedman] provides the inequality

[formula]

which completes the proof.

We want to prove that

[formula]

where Ω(a)  =  pπ / q. This inequality is equivalent to the following one

[formula]

Since Ω(a)  =  pπ / q, it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

Since [formula], the application of Corollary [\ref=cor1] provides inequality ([\ref=mainineq]) for [formula]. In order to prove inequality for [formula] let us note that by Proposition [\ref=PhiProp] for some ξ,η∈(0,a). Moreover,

[formula]

or

[formula]

Therefore, inequality ([\ref=mainineq]) follows from the inequality

[formula]

or the inequality

[formula]

The last inequality easily follows from Proposition [\ref=prop1].

Lawson surfaces

A Lawson tau-surface τm,k is an immersed surface in the sphere [formula] defined by the double-periodic immersion of [formula] given by the formula

[formula]

It was introduced by Lawson in the paper [\cite=Lawson]. He also proved that for each pair {m,k}, such that [formula] and (m,k) = 1, the surface τm,k is a distinct compact minimal surface in [formula]. Let us assume that (m,k) = 1 then if both m and k are odd then τm,k is a torus, we call it a Lawson torus. Otherwise τm,k is a Klein bottle, we call it a Lawson Klein bottle.

Let τm,k be a Lawson surface. Then the induced metric on τm,k is an extremal metric for the functional Λj(M,g), where

[formula]

[formula] if both m,k are odd and [formula] otherwise.

The corresponding value of the functional is

[formula]

Let j be defined by formula ([\ref=j]). If τm,k is a Lawson torus, then

[formula]

If τm,k is a Klein bottle, then

[formula]

It is sufficient to obtain the inequality

[formula]

Let us remark that the function

[formula]

is positive on the interval

[formula]

> ,

[formula]

Bipolar surfaces to the Lawson surfaces

Let [formula] be a minimal immersion. A Gauss map [formula] is defined pointwise as the image of the unit normal in [formula] translated to the origin in [formula]. Then the exterior product [formula] is an immersion of N in [formula]. Lawson proved in the paper [\cite=Lawson] that this immersion is minimal. The image Ĩ(N) is called a bipolar surface to N.

Let us denote by m,k the bipolar surface to the surface τm,k. Lapointe proved in the paper [\cite=Lapointe] that

if [formula] then m,k is a torus carrying the extremal metric for the functional [formula] and

[formula]

if [formula] then m,k is a torus carrying the extremal metric for the functional [formula] and

[formula]

if [formula] then m,k is a Klein bottle carrying the extremal metric for the functional [formula] and

[formula]

If [formula] then the following inequality holds

[formula]

If [formula] then the following inequality holds

[formula]

If [formula] and {m,k}  ≠  {3,1} then the following inequality holds

[formula]

In order to prove the first inequality it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

It is well-known that [formula] for ∈[0,1]. This implies that it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

This inequality holds for [formula]. The statement for 1,1 follows from the fact that 1,1 is a Clifford torus and Λ1(τ1,1)  =  4π2.

In the same way, in order to prove the second inequality in Proposition [\ref=BipLawsonProp] it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

This inequality holds for [formula].

The third inequality is equivalent the following one

[formula]

Since E()  <  π / 2 it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

This inequality holds for [formula]. For the exceptional case {m,k}  =  {5,3} one verifies the third inequality explicitly using the tables of elliptic integrals in the book [\cite=Friedman].

Bipolar surfaces to Otsuki tori

In the paper [\cite=Karpukhin] the following proposition was proved.

The bipolar surface Õp / q to an Otsuki torus Op / q is a torus.

If q is odd then the metric on bipolar Otsuki torus Õp / q is extremal for the functional [formula] and [formula].

If q is even then the metric on bipolar Otsuki torus Õp / q is extremal for the functional [formula] and [formula].

If q is even then the following inequality holds,

[formula]

If q is odd then one has the following inequality,

[formula]

If q is even, then we have

[formula]

We used the inequalities 2p > q and p > 1 in order to prove the last inequality. In the same way, if q is odd, then we have

[formula]

Now it is easy to see that Propositions [\ref=OtsukiEstimateProp], [\ref=LawsonProp], [\ref=BipLawsonProp], [\ref=BipOtsukiProp] together with Proposition [\ref=LowerBound] imply Theorem [\ref=MainTheorem].

Clifford torus

Let us represent the Clifford torus as a flat torus with the square lattice with edges equal to 2π. In this case the Laplace-Beltrami coinsides up to a sign with the classical two-dimensional Laplace operator. Therefore, using the separation of variables one obtains that the eigenfunctions are

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. Then, the eigenvalues are equal to n2 + m2, n2 + l2, k2 + m2, k2 + l2 respectively.

For the Clifford torus the Weyl's counting function N(λ) is equal to the number of integer points in the open disk of radius [formula] with the center at the origin of R2.

Let us introduce an one-to-one correspondence ν between eigenfunctions and integer points in [formula]. We set

[formula]

Let us also remark that the eigenvalue of the function f is equal to the squared distance between (0,0) and ν(f). This observation completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition [\ref=CliffordTheorem].

It is easy to check that the set of functions

[formula]

form an isometrical immersion of Clifford torus in the unit sphere. The same is true for the set

[formula]

and the set where k  ≠  l. Therefore, according to Theorem [\ref=th1], the metric on the Clifford torus is extremal for the functionals [formula], where r2  =  n2 + m2 with [formula], and [formula].

Let Br be a disc of radius r. Then one has a simple estimate

[formula]

So, it is sufficient to prove that

[formula]

and this inequality holds for [formula]. And for r2 < 6 holds the inequality 8πN(r2)  >  4πr2. This inequality can be obtained by the direct enumeration of all possible values of r2. This completes the proof of Proposition [\ref=CliffordTheorem].
