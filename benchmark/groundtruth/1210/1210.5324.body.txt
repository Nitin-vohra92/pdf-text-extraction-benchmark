On Fujita's log spectrum conjecture

Introduction

In a series of papers, Fujita introduced what he called the Kodaira energy of a polarized variety and he used it to study the adjunction theory of polarized varieties. See [\cite=Fujita1], [\cite=Fujita2], [\cite=Fujita] and [\cite=Fujita3] for details. Let us recall the definition.

Let (X,Δ) a lc pair and let M be a big divisor. The Kodaira energy of (X,Δ,M) is defined by

Of course the interesting case is when KX  +  Δ is not pseudo-effective. Using techniques from the minimal model program, Fujita proved that κε(X,Δ,M) is a rational number if (X,Δ) is log terminal, X has dimension at most three and M is big and nef, see Theorem 2.2 in [\cite=Fujita]. Moreover in [\cite=Fujita1], he stated the so called spectrum conjecture. It says that if Δ = 0 and M is ample then the set of negative Kodaira energies is finite away from zero. The goal of this work is to prove an analogue of the spectrum conjecture for pairs. It is easy to see that in this case the set of Kodaira energies is not discrete. On the other hand, Fujita conjectured that the limit points can be reached only from below, see [\cite=Fujita] and [\cite=Fujita3]. This is the content of the log spectrum conjecture and it is one of the main results of this paper.

Let Slsn be the set of Kodaira energies where (X,Δ) is a pair with X smooth, Δ is a reduced divisor with simple normal crossing support and M is an ample Cartier divisor on X. Then for any real number x < 0 the set [formula] is finite, for ε small enough.

Fujita proved that if [formula] and dim (X)  ≤  3 then the set of negative Kodaira energies is finite away from zero using boundedness of Fano threefolds with terminal singularities. See Theorem 3.4.1 in [\cite=Fujita]. Our approach is different. We will show how techniques from the minimal model program and the recent results in [\cite=HMX] allow us to prove Theorem [\ref=spectrum]. We will actually prove a more general result on a set of pseudo-effective thresholds. Moreover, this will imply that the Kodaira energy is a rational number in many cases. Note that the question of the rationality of the Kodaira energy has been extensively studied. For example see [\cite=Alexeev], [\cite=Araujo], [\cite=BCHM] and [\cite=Demailly].

Throughout this paper we will work with the pseudo-effective threshold instead of the Kodaira energy. It seems that the former invariant is more suitable for the minimal model program and it applies to a more general setting. Let us recall its definition.

Let (X,Δ) a lc pair and M an effective divisor such that KX  +  Δ + tM is pseudo-effective for some t  ≥  0. The pseudo-effective threshold τ(X,Δ;M) of M with respect to (X,Δ) is defined by

Note that in the case L is big, the pseudo-effective threshold and the Kodaira energy are easily related by the formula

We will study an analogue of Theorem [\ref=spectrum] for pseudo-effective thresholds in a slightly more general form, namely we allow the coefficients of Δ and M to vary in some fixed sets. In order to simplify the presentation of our results, let us first introduce some notation.

Fix a positive integer n and two subsets [formula] and [formula]. Then we define Dn(I,J) to be the set of all lc pairs (X,Δ) with an effective [formula]-divisor M on X such that X is a projective variety of dimension n, the coefficients of Δ (resp. M) are in I (resp. J) with (X,Δ + tM) lc and KX  +  Δ  +  tM pseudo-effective for some t  ≥  0.

The main object of study of this paper is the following set.

Fix a positive integer n and two subsets I  ⊂  [0,1] and [formula]. We define the set

We can now state our main theorem.

Fix a positive integer n and two sets I  ⊆  [0,1] and [formula]. If I and J satisfy the DCC then Tn(I,J) satisfies the ACC.

Note that we don't require M to be an ample divisor. If the coefficients of Δ or M are not in a DCC set, then it is easy to see that the above result is false even in dimension one.

Theorem [\ref=theo] implies that the Kodaira energy is a rational number if (X,Δ,M) satisfy the above conditions, see Corollary [\ref=rational].

Our main motivation in studying the ACC for pseudo-effective thresholds comes from effective birationality results of certain adjoint linear systems. See Section 4 for details. On the other hand we believe that these results have other applications. For example the pseudo-effective threshold is fundamental in the construction of Tamagawa numbers and it appears in formulas computing the asymptotic numbers of rational points of bounded heights. See [\cite=Batyrev], [\cite=Fujita2] and [\cite=Yuri] for details.

The results of this paper are based on the recent work of Hacon, M[formula]Kernan and Xu [\cite=HMX]. Furthermore some of the main ideas are inspired by Section 8 in [\cite=Demailly] and [\cite=Gongyo].

Preliminaries

Let us define what ACC and DCC stand for.

Let [formula].

We say that I satisfies the ACC (ascending chain condition) if every non-decreasing sequence [formula] is eventually constant.

We say that I satisfies the DCC (descending chain condition) if every non-increasing sequence [formula] is eventually constant.

As stated in the introduction we will work with singular pairs.

A pair (X,Δ) consists of a normal variety X and a [formula]-Weil divisor Δ  ≥  0 such that KX  +  Δ is [formula]-Cartier.

We will mainly deal with dlt and lc pairs. For the definitions and some properties of these singularities we refer to [\cite=KM].

Given any effective divisor M on a variety X, we define a global invariant which measures the singularities of M and X.

Let (X,Δ) be a lc pair and let M be an effective [formula]-dvisor. The log canonical threshold of M with respect to (X,Δ) is defined by Fix a positive integer n and two subsets [formula]. Let where (X,Δ) is a lc pair and the coefficients of Δ (resp. M) belong to I (resp. J).

One of the main theorems in [\cite=HMX] is that the above set satisfies the ACC.

Fix a positive integer n, [formula] and [formula]. If I and J satisfy the DCC then [formula] satisfies the ACC.

The proof of the above theorem is a very intricate induction procedure based on four theorems. One of these theorems will be fundamental for us. See Theorem 1.5 in [\cite=HMX].

Fix a positive integer [formula] and a set I  ⊆  [0,1], which satisfies the DCC. Then there is a finite subset I0  ⊆  I such that if

X is a projective variety of dimension n,

(X,Δ) is log canonical,

[formula] where δi∈I,

[formula],

then δi∈I0.

In order to apply Theorem [\ref=Hacon] we need to run the minimal model program with scaling. When KX  +  Δ is not pseudo-effective, Corollary 1.3.2 in [\cite=BCHM] allows us to run the MMP. The following is a generalization of results in [\cite=BCHM] to dlt pairs. See Theorem 2.15 in [\cite=Lohmann] for details.

Let (X,Δ) be a dlt pair such that KX  +  Δ is not pseudo-effective. Let H be an ample divisor such that KX  +  Δ + H is nef. Then any (KX  +  Δ)-MMP with scaling of H terminates with a Mori fiber space.

In what follows we will need dlt models. We state here the result we need and we refer to [\cite=Kollar] for a proof.

Let (X,Δ) be a lc pair. Then there is a proper birational morphism g:Xdlt  →  X with exceptional divisors Ei such that

[formula] is dlt,

Xdlt is [formula]-factorial,

[formula].

We can now apply the above lemma to reduce the study of pseudo-effective thresholds from lc pair to dlt pairs.

Let (X,Δ) be a pair with an effective divisor such that (X,Δ + tM) is lc and KX  +  Δ  +  tM is pseudo-effective for some t  ≥  0. Let I and J be two sets such that the coefficients of Δ (resp. M) are in I (resp. J). Then there exists X' with effective divisors Δ' and M' such that:

KX'  +  Δ' + tM' is dlt and pseudo-effective for some t  ≥  0,

the coefficients of Δ' (resp. M) belong to [formula] (resp. J),

τ(X,Δ;M) = τ(X',Δ';M').

Let τ: = τ(X,Δ;M). By assumption (X,Δ  +  τM) is a lc pair. By Lemma [\ref=dltmodel] we can take its dlt model [formula].

Let X': = Xdlt, [formula] and M': = g- 1*M, then [formula]. Since the right hand side is pseudo-effective, we have that τ(X',Δ';M')  ≤  τ. On the other hand [formula] for any t  ≥  0, thus τ(X',Δ';M')  =  τ.

ACC for pseudo-effective thresholds

In this section we prove Theorem [\ref=theo] and we give some applications. In particular we will prove Theorem [\ref=spectrum]. First we show that if J satisfies the DCC, or more generally if it admits a strictly positive minimum, then there are no diverging increasing sequences in Tn(I,J). This is a simple consequence of the fact that (X,Δ + tM) is lc.

Fix a positive integer n and two subsets I  ⊂  [0,1] and [formula]. If J admits a strictly positive minimum then there exists a positive real number α such that [formula].

Let [formula]. Since (X,Δ + tM) is lc it implies that also (X,Δ  +  τM) is lc, where τ: = τ(X,Δ;M). Then the coefficients of Δ  +  τM are less than one and in particular [formula], where α  =  δ- 1.

Note that in general if we don't ask that (X,Δ + tM) is lc, we can find diverging sequences of pseudo-effective thresholds even if [formula] and J is a finite set. So without any assumption it does not satisfy the ACC.

Let [formula] where [formula] and L is a line bundle of degree - e  ≤  0. Xe is usually called the e-th Hirzebruch surface. Recall that its canonical divisor is given numerically by [formula]. Let M = C0 + f. It is easy to see that M is big but not nef. A simple computation shows that τ(Xe,M)  ≥  e + 2.

On the other hand, if we add some positivity to the divisor M we can obtain a uniform upper bound on τ(X,Δ;M) without asking the pair (X,Δ  +  τM) to be lc. For example, a theorem of Kollár in [\cite=Kol] implies that if M is a big and nef Cartier divisor then [formula].

We are now ready to prove Theorem [\ref=theo]. Compare with Proposition 8.7 in [\cite=Demailly] and Lemma 3.1 in [\cite=Gongyo].

Let τ: = τ(X,Δ;M)∈Tn(I,J) such that τ > 0. By Lemma [\ref=dlt], we can assume that (X,Δ  +  τM) is a dlt pair. For any x < τ the pair (X,Δ + xM) is also dlt by Corollary 2.39 in [\cite=KM]. By Theorem [\ref=MMP], we can run a KX  +  Δ + xM minimal model with scaling and end with a KX  +  Δ + xM Mori fiber space Yx  →  Zx with generic fiber Fx. Let [formula] be the birational map given by the MMP. By definition of Mori fiber space, we have that

[formula]

is anti-ample and in particular x < η(x): = τ(Fx,ΔFx;MFx). Note that the coefficients of ΔFx (resp. MFx) belong to I (resp. J). Since KFx  +  ΔFx  +  τMFx is pseudo-effective, η(x)  ≤  τ. Then x < η(x)  ≤  τ, for any 0 < x  ≤  τ.

We want to prove that if x is sufficiently close to τ then (Fx,ΔFx  +  η(x)MFx) is a lc pair. Suppose by contradiction that [formula] for any x close to τ. We define an increasing sequence [formula] converging to τ with the following properties: 0 < xi  <  τ and [formula]. Since (Fx,ΔFx + xiMFx) is dlt, we know that [formula]. In particular, we get an increasing sequence of lc thresholds converging to τ. This contradict the ACC for log canonical thresholds, Theorem [\ref=lct].

We prove the theorem by induction on the dimension of X. If dim (X) = 1 the result is obvious.

Let (Xi,Δi) be a sequence of pairs with effective divisors Mi on Xi such that the sequence τi: = τ(Xi,Δi;Mi) is non-decreasing. We want to prove that the sequence is eventually constant. Choose 0 < xi  <  τi sufficiently close to τi such that the pair (Fi,ΔFi  +  ηiMFi) is lc, where Fi: = Fxi and ηi: = τ(Fi,ΔFi;MFi). Recall that xi  <  ηi  ≤  τi. Furthermore, we can choose the sequence [formula] such that each 0 < xi  <  τi satisfy also xi  >  τi - 1. Since ηi > xi  >  ηi - 1, we have that the sequence [formula] is increasing. By construction, it is enough to prove that the sequence [formula] is eventually constant.

Passing to a non-decreasing subsequence we can assume that dim (Fi) is constant. If dim (Fi) < n then by induction we conclude that the sequence [formula] is eventually constant. So we can assume that Yi has Picard number one for any i. Then [formula] and the pair (Yi,ΔYi  +  ηiMYi) is lc. Since [formula] is non-decreasing, the coefficients of ΔYi  +  ηiMYi are in a DCC set.

We can now apply Theorem [\ref=Hacon] to the pairs (Yi,ΔYi  +  ηiMYi). It implies that the sequence [formula] is eventually constant and then also [formula] is eventually constant.

As a first consequence, we prove Theorem [\ref=spectrum] stated in the introduction.

The proof is by contradiction. Recall that κε(X,Δ,M) =  - τ(X,Δ;M). Assume that the statement of Theorem [\ref=spectrum] does not hold, then there exists a sequence of pairs (Xi,Δi) with ample divisors Mi such that their pseudo-effective thresholds τi: = τ(Xi,Δi;Mi) define an increasing sequence that converges to some positive number. Let H'i: = KXi  +  Δi  +  2n2Mi. By Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=Fujino], we have that H'i is a globally generated ample divisor on Xi and KXi  +  Δi + H'i is pseudo-effective. Choose a general element Hi∈|H'i| such that (Xi,Δi + Hi) is lc. Let ηi: = τ(Xi,Δi;Hi). Note that [formula] for every i. Furthermore

This implies that

A simple computation shows that the sequence [formula] is increasing as well. This contradicts Theorem [\ref=theo] with [formula].

Looking at the proof of the Theorem [\ref=theo], we deduce a structure result for the set Tn(I,J). To make the presentation easier, we introduce the following set.

Define where ρ(X) is the Picard number of X.

Fix a positive integer n and two sets [formula] and [formula]. If I and J satisfy the DCC then

First we prove that [formula]. Clearly it is enough to prove that Tn - 1(I,J)  ⊆  Tn(I,J). Let E be an elliptic curve. If (X,Δ;M)∈Dn - 1(I,J), we define X' = X  ×  E, Δ' = Δ  ×  E and M' = M  ×  E. By construction (X',Δ';M')∈Dn(I,J) and they have the same pseudo-effective threshold.

It remains to prove the other inclusion. If we prove that then we are done applying induction on n.

Let τ: = τ(X,Δ;M)∈Tn(I,J). If ρ(X) = 1 then τ∈Ton(I,J). Suppose that ρ(X) > 1. Let [formula] be a non-decreasing sequence such that 0 < xi  <  τ, lim xi  =  τ and xi  >  η(xi - 1), where η(xi) is obtained as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=theo]. Then xi  <  η(xi)  ≤  τ for any i and lim η(xi) = τ. By Theorem [\ref=theo] the sequence [formula] is eventually constant and in particular, there exists an i such that η(xi) = τ.

Fujita in [\cite=Fujita] proved a similar result when n = 3 and [formula].

As a corollary of the structure theorem of Tn(I,J), we have that the set of pseudo-effective thresholds is contained in the rational numbers.

If [formula] and [formula] satisfy the DCC then [formula].

We prove the result by induction on the dimension of X. If dim (X) = 1 it is obvious. By Corollary [\ref=decomposition], we have that By induction, it is enough to prove that [formula]. If τ∈Ton(I,J) is different from zero, then M is an ample divisor. Since [formula], we see that τ is the the nef threshold of M with respect to (X,Δ). Then the Rationality Theorem in [\cite=KM] implies that [formula].

In particular, if we fix a lc pair (X,Δ) we get Proposition 8.7 in [\cite=Demailly].

Let (X,Δ) be a lc pair with Δ an effective [formula]-divisor. Let M be an effective [formula]-divisor such that (X,Δ + tM) is lc and KX  +  Δ + tM is pseudo-effective for some t  ≥  0. Then τ(X,Δ;M) is a rational number.

Let I (resp. J) be the set of coefficients of Δ (resp. M). Since they are both finite sets, we can apply the above corollary.

We can now give a generalization to lc pairs of Corollary 1.1.7 in [\cite=BCHM].

Let (X,Δ) a lc pair with Δ an effective [formula]-divisor and M an ample [formula]-Cartier divisor. Then τ(X,Δ;M) is a rational number.

Replacing M with a sufficiently high power of itself, we can assume that τ(X,Δ;M) < 1. The result follows from the fact that we can find an effective divisor M' such that [formula] and (X,Δ + M') is lc.

If (X,Δ) is a klt pair we can generalize the above statement when M is only big and nef.

Let (X,Δ) a klt pair with Δ an effective [formula]-divisor and M a big and nef [formula]-Cartier divisor. Then τ(X,Δ;M) is a rational number.

As before, we can assume that τ(X,Δ;M) < 1. By Proposition 2.61, we can write [formula] for k large enough. In the previous decomposition Ak is an ample [formula]-divisor and E is an effective [formula]-divisor. Choosing k sufficiently large, we can assume that (X,Δ + (1 / k)E) is a klt pair. Finally, there exists an effective divisor A' that is [formula]-linearly equivalent to Ak such that (X,Δ + A' + (1 / k)E) is klt. Note that [formula] so we don't change the pseudo-effective threshold. Then Corollary [\ref=rational] applies.

Let us conclude this section with a slightly different version of Theorem [\ref=spectrum].

Fix a positive integer n and a DCC set [formula]. Let Tn(I) be the set of pseudo-effective thresholds τ(X,Δ;M) where (X,Δ) is a klt pair such that dim (X) = n, the coefficients of Δ are in I, - (KX  +  Δ) is nef and M is a big and nef Cartier divisor on X. Then the set Tn(I) satisfies the ACC.

Since M - KX  -  Δ is big and nef, Theorem 1.1 in [\cite=Kol2] implies that we can find a positive integer m', which depends only on n, such that m'M is base point free. Choose [formula]. Then Theorem 5.8 in [\cite=Kol] implies that KX  +  Δ + mM is pseudo-effective. Since mM is base point free, we can choose a general element H∈|mM| such that the coefficients of H are all equal to one, (X,Δ + H) is lc and KX  +  Δ + H is pseudo-effective. Finally, Theorem [\ref=theo] gives the result.

Effective birationality

The following result tells us that the pseudo-effective threshold has a key role in questions of effective birationality of certain adjoint linear systems. See Proposition 3.2 in [\cite=Gabriele].

Let (X,Δ) be a klt pair. Let M be a big and nef Cartier divisor on X such that KX  +  Δ + M is big. Let τ: = τ(X,Δ;M) be the pseudo-effective threshold of M with respect to (X,Δ). Then for any the map induced by the linear system [formula] is birational.

In order to give a uniform bound, it suffices to bound away from one the pseudo-effective threshold. If [formula] then it follows from Theorem [\ref=theo]. Note that we don't assume that (X,Δ + M) is lc, but it is close to be lc.

Fix a positive integer n and a DCC set [formula]. Then there exists mn,I such that the map associated to the linear system [formula] is birational for any m  ≥  mn,I and any [formula] with M a big and nef Cartier divisor.

Combining Theorem [\ref=effective] and Corollary [\ref=ample] we get the following.

Fix a positive integer n and a DCC set [formula]. Then there exists a positive integer mn,I such that if

X is a projective variety with dim (X) = n,

(X,Δ) is a klt pair such that - (KX  +  Δ) is nef,

the coefficients of Δ are in I,

M is a big and nef Cartier divisor such that KX  +  Δ + M is big,

then the map associated to the linear system [formula] is birational for any m  ≥  mn,I

Using the canonical bundle formula, Corollary [\ref=iitaka] implies the uniformity of the Iitaka fibration when the image has nef anti-canonical divisor. See Section 4 in [\cite=Gabriele] for details.

Note that if τ = 0 in Theorem [\ref=effective] we don't even need that the coefficients of Δ are in a DCC set. Analogously we have.

Fix a positive integer n and a positive real number δ. Then there exists a positive integer mn,δ such that if

(X,Δ) is a lc pair,

dim (X) = n,

KX is pseudo-effective,

[formula] with ai  ≥  δ,

KX  +  Δ is big,

then the map associated to [formula] is birational for any m  ≥  mn,δ.

Since KX is pseudo-effective, τ(X,Δ) = 0. This implies that KX  +  αD is big for any α  ≥  0. Choose [formula]. Then Theorem C in [\cite=HMX] gives the result.

If we want to deal with effective birationality results, maybe the condition (X,Δ  +  τM) is lc can be substituted with a more suitable condition. A possible way to overcome this difficulty may be the following.

Let (X,Δ) be a klt pair and let M be a big and nef Cartier divisor on X. Suppose that KX  +  Δ + M is big and [formula]. Is the pseudo-effective threshold τ(X,Δ;M) uniformly bounded away from one?

Even if the previous question seems very restrictive, using the argument in [\cite=Jiang] and Theorem [\ref=effective], it implies the uniformity of the Iitaka fibration when the variation is maximal. See [\cite=Gabriele] for more details.
