On the independent subsets of powers of paths and cycles

Introduction

For a graph [formula] we denote by [formula] the set of its vertices, and by [formula] the set of its edges.

For [formula],

the h-power of a path, denoted by [formula], is a graph with n vertices v1, v2, [formula], vn such that, for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, i  ≠  j, [formula] if and only if |j - i|  ≤  h;

the h-power of a cycle, denoted by [formula], is a graph with n vertices v1, v2, [formula], vn such that, for 1  ≤  i,j  ≤  n, i  ≠  j, [formula] if and only if |j - i|  ≤  h or |j - i|  ≥  n - h.

Thus, for instance, [formula] and [formula] are the graphs made of n isolated nodes, [formula] is the path with n vertices, and [formula] is the cycle with n vertices. Figures [\ref=fig:P_1-6_2], and [\ref=fig:Q_1-6_2] show some powers of paths and cycles, respectively.

An independent subset of a graph [formula] is a subset of [formula] not containing adjacent vertices.

Let [formula], and [formula] be the Hasse diagrams of the posets of independent subsets of [formula], and [formula], respectively, ordered by inclusion. Clearly, [formula] is a Boolean lattice with n atoms (n-cube, for short).

Every independent subset S of [formula] can be represented by a binary string [formula], where, for [formula], bi  =  1 if and only if vi∈S. Specifically, each independent subset of [formula] is associated with a binary string of length n such that the distance between any two 1's of the string is greater than h. Following [\cite=fibocubes_enum] (see also [\cite=survey_fibo]), a Fibonacci string of order n is a binary strings of length n without (two) consecutive 1's. Recalling that the Hamming distance between two binary strings α and β is the number H(α,β) of bits where α and β differ, we can define the Fibonacci cube of order n, denoted Γn, as the graph (V,E), where V is the set of all Fibonacci strings of order n and, for all α,β∈V, (α,β)∈E if and only if H(α,β) = 1. One can observe that for h = 1 the binary strings associated with independent subsets of [formula] are Fibonacci strings of order n, and the Hasse diagram of the set of all such strings ordered bitwise is Γn. Fibonacci cubes were introduced as an interconnection scheme for multicomputers in [\cite=hsu], and their combinatorial structure has been further investigated, e.g.  in [\cite=klavzar] [\cite=fibocubes_enum]. Several generalizations of the notion of Fibonacci cubes has been proposed (see, e.g., [\cite=gen_fibo] [\cite=survey_fibo]).

Consider the generalized Fibonacci cubes described in [\cite=gen_fibo], i.e., the graphs Bn(α) obtained from the n-cube Bn of all binary strings of length n by removing all vertices that contain the binary string α as a substring. In this notation the Fibonacci cube is Bn(11). It is not difficult to see that [formula] cannot be expressed, in general, in terms of Bn(α). Instead we have:

[formula]

where [formula] is the subgraph of Bn obtaining by removing all strings that contain either α or β.

A similar argument can be carried out in the case of cycles. Indeed, every independent subset S of [formula] can be represented by a circular binary string (i.e., a sequence of 0's and 1's with the first and last bits considered to be adjacent) [formula], where, for [formula], bi  =  1 if and only if vi∈S. Thus, each independent subset of [formula] is associated with a circular binary string of length n such that the distance between any two 1's of the string is greater than h. A Lucas cube of order n, denoted Λn, is defined as the graph whose vertices are the binary strings of length n without either two consecutive 1's or a 1 in the first and in the last position, and in which the vertices are adjacent when their Hamming distance is exactly 1 (see [\cite=lucas]). For h = 1 the Hasse diagram of the set of all circular binary strings associated with independent subsets of [formula] ordered bitwise is Λn. A generalization of the notion of Lucas cubes has been proposed in [\cite=gen_lucas].

Consider the generalized Lucas cubes described in [\cite=gen_lucas], that is, the graphs Bn() obtained from the n-cube Bn of all binary strings of length n by removing all vertices that have a circular containing α as a substring (i.e., such that α is contained in the circular binary strings obtained by connecting first and last bits of the string). In this notation the Lucas cube is Bn(). It is not difficult to see that [formula] cannot be expressed, in general, in terms of Bn(). Instead we have:

[formula]

As far as we now, our [formula], and [formula] are new generalizations of Fibonacci and Lucas cubes, respectively.

In the first part of the paper we evaluate p(h)n, i.e., the number of independent subsets of [formula], and H(h)n, i.e., the number of edges of [formula]. Our main result (Theorem [\ref=th:main]) is that, for n,h  ≥  0, the sequence H(h)n is obtained by convolving the sequence [formula] with itself.

In the second part of the paper we derive similar results for q(h)n, i.e., the number of independent subsets of [formula], and M(h)n, i.e., the number of edges of [formula].

The independent subsets of powers of paths

For n,h,k  ≥  0, we denote by p(h)n,k the number of independent k-subsets of [formula].

For h = 1, p(h)n,k counts the number of binary strings α∈Γn such that [formula].

For n,h,k  ≥  0,

[formula]

This result is Theorem 1 of [\cite=hoggatt]. Below we write down a different proof.

By Definition [\ref=def:indipendent_subset], any two elements vi,vj of an independent subset of [formula] must satisfy |j - i| > h. It is straightforward to check that whenever n - hk - h < 0, [formula]. It is also immediate to see that when n = h = 0 our lemma holds true.

Suppose now n - hk - h  ≥  0. We can complete the proof of our lemma by establishing a bijection between independent k-subset of [formula] and k-subsets of a set with (n - hk + h) elements. Let [formula] be the set of all k-subsets of a set [formula], and Ik the set of all independent k-subsets of [formula]. Consider the map [formula] such that, for any [formula], with [formula],

[formula]

The map f associates with each k-subset [formula] an independent k-subset of [formula].

To see this we first remark that f(S) is a k-subset of [formula]. Furthermore, for each pair bij,bij + t∈S, with t > 0, we have

[formula]

Hence, by Definition [\ref=def:h-path], [formula]. Thus, f(S) is an independent subset of [formula].

The map f is bijective.

It is easy to see that f is injective. Then, we consider the map [formula] such that, for any [formula], with [formula],

[formula]

Following the same steps as for f, one checks that f- 1 is injective. Thus, f is surjective.

By Claims [\ref=claim:1] and [\ref=claim:2] we have established a bijection between independent k-subsets of [formula] and k-subsets of a set with (n - hk + h)  ≥  0 elements. The lemma is proved.

The coefficients p(h)n,k also enjoy the following property: p(h)n,k  =  p(h - 1)n - k + 1,k.

For [formula], the number of all independent subsets of [formula] is

[formula]

Denote by Fn the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence F1 = 1, F2 = 1, and Fi = Fi - 1 + Fi - 2, for i > 2. Then, p(1)n = Fn + 2 is the number of elements of the Fibonacci cube of order n.

The following, simple fact is crucial for our work.

For n,h  ≥  0,

[formula]

A proof of this Lemma can be also obtained using the first part of [\cite=hoggatt].

For n  ≤  h + 1, by Definition [\ref=def:indipendent_subset], the independent subsets of [formula] have no more than 1 element. Thus, there are n + 1 independent subsets of [formula].

Consider the case n  >  h + 1. Let I be the set of all independent subsets of [formula], let Iin be the set of the independent subsets of [formula] that contain vn, and let [formula]. The elements of Iout are in one-to-one correspondence with the p(h)n - 1 independent subsets of [formula], and those of Iin are in one-to-one correspondence with the p(h)n - h - 1 independent subsets of [formula].

The poset of independent subsets of powers of paths

Figure [\ref=fig:P_3-4_h] shows a few Hasse diagrams [formula]. Notice that, as stated in the introduction, for each n, [formula] is the Fibonacci cube Γn.

Let H(h)n be the number of edges of [formula]. Noting that in [formula] each non-empty independent k-subset covers exactly k independent (k - 1)-subsets, we can write

[formula]

For h = 1, H(h)n counts the number of edges of Γn.

Let now T(n,h)k,i be the number of independent k-subsets of [formula] containing the vertex vi, and let, for h,k  ≥  0, [formula], [formula]

For n,h,k  ≥  0, and 1  ≤  i  ≤  n,

[formula]

No independent subset of [formula] containing vi contains any of the elements [formula]. Let r and s be non-negative integers whose sum is k - 1. Each independent k-subset of [formula] containing vi can be obtained by adding vi to a (k - 1)-subset [formula] such that

(a) [formula] is an independent r-subset of [formula];

(b) [formula] is an independent s-subset of [formula].

Viceversa, one can obtain each of this pairs of subsets by removing vi from an independent k-subset of [formula] containing vi. Thus, T(n,h)k,i is obtained by counting independently the subsets of type (a) and (b). Noting that the subsets of type (b) are in bijection with the independent s-subsets of [formula], the lemma is proved.

T(n,1)k,i counts the number of strings [formula] such that: (i) [formula], and (ii) bi = 1.

In order to obtain our main result, we prepare a lemma.

For positive n,

[formula]

The inner sum counts the number of k-subsets exactly k times, one for each element of the subset. That is, [formula]. The lemma follows directly from Equation ([\ref=eq:H_nh_formula]).

Next we introduce a family of Fibonacci-like sequences.

For h  ≥  0, and n  ≥  1, we define the h-Fibonacci sequence F(h)  =  {F(h)n}n  ≥  1 whose elements are

[formula]

From Lemma [\ref=lem:p_n_recurrence], and setting for h  ≥  0, and [formula], [formula] we have that,

[formula]

Thus, our Fibonacci-like sequences are obtained by adding a prefix of h ones to the sequence [formula]. Therefore, we have:

[formula];

F(1) is the Fibonacci sequence;

more generally, [formula].

In the following, we use the discrete convolution operation [formula], as follows.

[formula]

For n,h  ≥  0, the following holds.

[formula]

The sum [formula] counts the number of independent subsets of [formula] containing vi. We can also obtain such a value by counting the independent subsets of both [formula], and [formula]. Thus, we have:

[formula]

Using Lemma [\ref=lem:somma_tabelle_T] we can write

[formula]

By Equation ([\ref=eq:F_and_p]) we have [formula] By ([\ref=eq:convolution]), the theorem is proved.

For h = 1, we obtain the number of edges of Γn by using Fibonacci numbers:

[formula]

The latter result is [\cite=mediannature].

The independent subsets of powers of cycles

For n,h,k  ≥  0, we denote by q(h)n,k the number of independent k-subsets of [formula].

For h = 1, n > 1, q(h)n,k counts the number of binary strings α∈Λn such that [formula].

For n,h  ≥  0, and k > 1,

[formula]

Moreover, q(h)n,0 = 1, and q(h)n,1 = n, for each n,h  ≥  0.

Fix an element [formula], and let n > 2h. Any independent subset of [formula] containing vi does not contain the h elements preceding vi and the h elements following vi. Thus, the number of independent k-subsets of [formula] containing vi equals

[formula]

The total number of independent k-subsets of [formula] is obtained by multiplying p(h)n - 2h - 1,k - 1 by n, then dividing it by k (each subset is counted k times by the previous proceeding). The case n  ≤  2h, as well as the cases k = 0,1, can be easily verified.

For [formula], the number of all independent subsets of [formula] is

[formula]

Denote by Ln the nth element of the Lucas sequence L1 = 1, L2 = 3, and Li = Li - 1 + Li - 2, for i > 2. Then, for n > 1, q(1)n = Ln is the number of elements of the Lucas cube of order n.

The coefficients q(h)n satisfy a recursion that closely resemble that of Lemma 2.2.

For n,h  ≥  0,

[formula]

The case n  ≤  2h + 1 can be easily checked. Let n > 3h + 2, and let I be the set of the independent subsets of [formula]. Let Iin be the subset of these subsets that (i) do not contain vn, and that (ii) contain no one of the following pairs: [formula]. Furthermore let Iout be the subset of the remaining independent subsets of [formula].

It is easy to see that the elements of Iin are exactly the independent subsets of [formula]. Indeed, vn is not a vertex of [formula] and the vertices of pairs (v1,vn - h), (v2,vn - h + 1), [formula], (vh,vn - 1) are connected in [formula]. On the other hand, to show that

[formula]

we argue as follows. First we recall (see the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:q_nk_formula]) that the number of independent k-subsets of [formula] that contain vn is p(h)n - 2h - 1,k - 1. Secondly we obtain that the number of independent k-subsets of [formula] containing one of the pairs (v1,vn - h), (v2,vn - h + 1), [formula], (vh,vn - 1) is hp(h)n - 3h - 2,k - 2. To see this, consider the pair (v1,vn - h). The independent subsets containing such a pair do not contain the h vertices from vn - h + 1 to vn, do not contain the h vertices from v2 to vh + 1, and do not contain the h vertices from vn - 2h to vn - h - 1. Thus, the removal of such vertices and of the vertices v1 and vn - h turns [formula] into [formula]. Hence we can obtain all the independent k-subsets of [formula] that contain the pair (v1,vn - h) by simply adding these two vertices to one of the p(h)n - 3h - 2,k - 2 independent k - 2-subsets of [formula]. Same reasoning can be carried out for any other one of the pairs: (v2,vn - h + 1), [formula], (vh,vn - 1).

Using Lemmas [\ref=lem:p_nk_formula] and [\ref=lem:q_nk_formula] one can easily derive that

[formula]

Hence, we derive the size of Iout:

[formula]

Summing up we have shown that |I| = |Iin| + |Iout|, that is

[formula]

The proof of the case 2h + 1 < n  ≤  3h + 2 is obtained in a similar way, observing that |Iout| = n - h, and that n - h - 1  ≤  2h + 1.

The poset of independent subsets of powers of cycles

Figure [\ref=fig:Q_3-4_h] shows a few Hasse diagrams [formula]. Notice that, as stated in the introduction, for each n, [formula] is the Lucas cube Λn.

Let M(h)n be the number of edges of [formula]. As done in Section [\ref=sec:hasse_of_paths] for the case of paths, we immediately provide a formula for M(h)n:

[formula]

For h = 1, n > 1, M(h)n counts the number of edges of Λn. As shown in [\cite=lucas], M(h)n = nFn - 1.

As shown in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:q_nk_formula], the value

[formula]

is the analogue of the coefficient T(n,h)k,i: in the case of cycles we have no dependencies on i, because each choice of vertex is equivalent. We can obtain M(h)n in terms of a fibonacci-like sequence, as follows.

For n > h  ≥  0, the following holds.

[formula]

Using Equation ([\ref=eq:F_and_p]) we obtain:

[formula]
