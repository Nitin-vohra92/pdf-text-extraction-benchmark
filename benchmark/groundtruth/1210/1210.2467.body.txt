Exact and approximate solutions of Schrödinger's equation for a class of trigonometric potentials

Introduction

Analytic solutions of Schrödinger's equation are possible only for few potential models. Although there are a number of approximation methods available in the literature to estimate the solution of Schrödinger's equation, they cannot usually be used to study both the exact solutions as well as approximate solutions. The asymptotic iteration method was recently introduced and this can indeed find both the exact and numerical solutions of Schrödinger equation for a very large number of quantum potentials [\cite=aim1]. If the eigenvalue problem is analytically solvable, the aysmptotic iteration method provides explicit algebraic expressions for the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions [\cite=aim2]. Meanwhile, if the eigenvalue problem is not exactly solvable, the asymptotic iteration method provides approximate solutions (for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) through its termination condition [\cite=aim3]. in In the present work we use the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) to provide both exact and approximate solutions of Schrödinger's equation for a class of one-dimensional trigonometric potentials. The approach discussed here can be easily applied to solve Schrödinger's equation for other potentials, such as the Rosen-Morse potential, the Eckart potential, and the Pöschl-Teller potential. in Another purpose of the present work is to explore perturbation theory based on the asymptotic iteration method to obtain a perturbation expansion for the energy eigenvalues [\cite=aim5] [\cite=bakarat], up to the fourth-order of approximation in some cases. The advantage of the perturbation method presented here lies in the direct computation of the coefficients in the perturbation series without the necessity of having the eigenfunctions of the unperturbed problem available. in

A variety of applications of the asymptotic iteration method are studied in the present work: first as a method for obtaining exact analytic solutions, second as a direct approximation method, thirdly as a method for obtaining the terms in perturbation series. The organization of the paper is as follows: in the next section we present a brief introduction to the asymptotic iteration method; this is followed by the description of its perturbation version in section III. In section IV, we study the sine-square potential defined by

[formula]

We use the standard asymptotic iteration method to obtain accurate numerical approximations to the energy eigenvalues. We then analyze the eigenvalue problem using our perturbation method, regarding V1(x) as a perturbation of the zero potential. In section V, we study the double-cosine potential defined by

[formula]

by means of the asymptotic iteration method. In section VI, we apply the asymptotic iteration method to obtain exact analytical solutions for the tangent potential

[formula]

Finally in section VII, we investigate the exact solutions of the complex cotangent potential

[formula]

A brief introduction to the asymptotic iteration method

A detailed description of the asymptotic iteration method can be found in Refs. [\cite=aim1] [\cite=aim2] [\cite=aim3] [\cite=aim4] [\cite=aim5] [\cite=aim6]. For completeness, we present here a brief outline of the method. Given sufficiently differentiable functions λ0(x) and s0(x), the second-order linear differential equation

[formula]

has a general solution

[formula]

where C1 and C2 are constants, if for sufficiently large n > 0,

[formula]

where

[formula]

Note that the termination condition ([\ref=eq7]) can be written equivalently as

[formula]

where n refers to the iteration number. The δn(x) function has a crucial role for solving the boundary-value problem: since the coefficients sn and λn depend on the (unknown) eigenvalue E that are usually determined by the roots of equation ([\ref=eq9]). If, for λ0 and s0 and exact E, the termination condition [formula] is satisfied at every x point, then the problem is called 'exactly solvable' and in this case the radial quantum number (or the number of nodes in the wave function) is equal to the iteration number. If the problem is not analytically solvable, the expression for δn(x) depends on both x and the unknown E where in this case the eigenvalues are obtained through the numerical roots of ([\ref=eq9]) at some suitable (chosen) x0-point. This initial value may be determined generally as the maximum value of the asymptotic wave function or the minimum value of the potential [\cite=aim3], however, the initial value is easily determined if the spacial domain for the given eigenvalue problem is bounded. Indeed, for this class of problem where x∈[a,b], the average point x0 = (a + b) / 2 will be sufficient to initiate the iteration process.

A perturbation theory via asymptotic iteration method

In Ref. [\cite=aim5], the present authors gave a new perturbation theory based on the asymptotic iteration method [\cite=aim5]. In order to apply the method for a class of trigonometric potentials regarded as perturbations of the zero potential, we outline our perturbation approach. Assume the potential is given as follows

[formula]

where V0(x) is a solvable potential, V1(x) is the perturbation potential, and μ is a perturbation expansion parameter. The one-dimensional Schrödinger equation reads

[formula]

Substitute Ψ(x) = y(x)f(x) where y(x) is an asymptotic solution satisfying the boundary conditions for the eigenvalue problem ([\ref=eq11]). Substitution yields the following differential equation for f(x)

[formula]

which is in a form suitable for the asymptotic iteration method. Using ([\ref=eq12]), we can now compute the sequences λn(x,μ) and sn(x,μ). The termination condition δn(x,μ), as given by ([\ref=eq12]), can be written as

[formula]

Expanding δn(x;μ,E) about μ = 0, we obtain the following infinite series

[formula]

that resembles Taylor's expansion with

[formula]

According to the standard theory of the asymptotic iteration method, the eigenvalues are obtained by the solution of the equation δn(x;μ,E) = 0 for arbitrary μ and thus the perturbation coefficients satisfy

[formula]

It is clear from the standard theory of the asymptotic iteration method that the root of the equation δn,0(x;0,E) = 0 gives the eigenvalue of the non-perturbative Hamiltonian, say, En,0 that may depend on n (the number of iterations used by the asymptotic iteration method). Meanwhhile δn,1(x;0,E)  =  0 gives the first-order correction to the eigenvalue En,0, say En,1, δn,2(x;μ0,E)  =  0 gives the second-order correction to the eigenvalue En,0, say En,2, and so on. This procedure allows us to find the coefficients of the eigenvalue expansion

[formula]

where (again) En,k are computed by solving δn,k(x,0,E) = 0. It is an attractive feature of the asymptotic iteration method that we can also find the eigenfunctions by means of equation ([\ref=eq9]) where it is sufficient to compute

[formula]

Again if we expand α(x,μ) about μ = 0, we obtain the following series

[formula]

where αk(x,0), [formula] is given by

[formula]

The correction of the wave function is then given by

[formula]

Thus we have a perturbation method (based on the asymptotic iteration method) that could in principle provide a complete solution to the given eigenvalue problem.

Sine-squared potential

In this section we present the solution of the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for the trigonometric sine-square potential ([\ref=eq1])

[formula]

The behavior of the wave function at the boundaries suggests a solution of the form

[formula]

Substituting for Ψ(x) in equation ([\ref=eq22]), we obtain

[formula]

A further change of the independent variable x = a arcsin (y) yields

[formula]

where ω = 1 + μ - a2E and μ = V0a2. We now find solutions of this differential equation by using two different approaches: (1) the standard asymptotic iteration method discussed in section II; (2) the perturbation method developed in section III.

The standard asymptotic iteration method

We may initiate the iteration method with

[formula]

The sequences sn and λn, [formula] can then be evaluated using ([\ref=eq8]). These quantities, for fixed a and V0, are functions of the parameter E and the variable y. For a suitable initial value of y = y0 < 1, the eigenvalues E are computed using the roots of the termination condition ([\ref=eq12]). We select the initial value y0 = 0 that locate potential minimum as given by ([\ref=eq1]). In Table 1, we report our numerical calculation of En for different values of the parameter μ, where n represent the node of the wave function solution, as given using the asymptotic iteration method.

Perturbation theory via the asymptotic iteration method

The exact values of a2E in the case μ = 0 as shown in Table 1 do not come as a surprise for we have noted the problem is equivalent to solving Schrödinger equation for the particle in rigid box V0 = 0; namely for the potential

[formula]

The differential equation ([\ref=eq25]) reads for μ = 0

[formula]

can immediately solve with polynomial solutions are given for

[formula]

by

[formula]

Energy Expansion

Suppose that the a2E can be written as follows

[formula]

In order to get a zeroth-order approximation to a2E using the iteration method discussed in section 3, we have for

[formula]

that exact values

[formula]

as expected using the exact solutions mentioned earlier. Thus for the ground state n = 0, we have

[formula]

In order to find the first order approximation ν0,1, we take a2E0 = 1 + ν0,1μ and solve the termination equation

[formula]

where δ(y,μ) is now computed using

[formula]

Straightforward computation using the sequences λn and sn, we obtain for the second-iteration the following expression for δ(y,μ)

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

as the first correction for the eigenvalue. A similar computation using [formula] shows that ν0,2 =  - 1  /  128, and, using a2E0 = 1 + (1  /  4)μ  -  (1  /  128)μ2  +  ν0,3μ3, that ν0,3  =  1  /  4096, and for a2E0 = 1 + (1  /  4)μ  -  (1  /  128)μ2  +  (1  /  4096)μ3  +  ν0,4μ4 that ν0,4 =  - 1  /  393216, where in each case we update the expressions for λ0 and s0 to initiate the computation of δ(y,μ). Thus the ground-state energy eigenvalue expansion takes the form

[formula]

for sufficiently small μ as usual for standard perturbation theory. For the first-excited state, we obtain the eigenvalue expansion

[formula]

and for arbitrary n  ≥  2,

[formula]

Wave function expansion

In order to calculate the perturbation expansion for the wave function, we note first that the zeroth-order solution of the Eq.([\ref=eq22]), using equation ([\ref=eq29]), is

[formula]

Unlike the standard perturbation theory, the first-order corrected wave function using our approach can be computed without the use of the zeroth-order solution. Indeed, from ([\ref=eq20]) we have for the first correction, using a2E = 1 + ν0,1μ,

[formula]

Thus

[formula]

and

[formula]

However, since [formula] we have

[formula]

Finally, the first-order approximation for the wave function is

[formula]

where ψ0(x) is the first-order approximation of the ground-state wave function solution of ([\ref=eq23]). Similarly, we can compute the first-order approximation for n = 1 where we have

[formula]

the first-order approximation for n = 2, we have

[formula]

Finally, for the first-order approximation in the case of n = 3, we have

[formula]

Equivalent potentials

We may note using the trigonometric identities

[formula]

that the eigenvalue solutions of the following schrödinger equations for trigonometric potentials confined between two rigid walls of infinite potential energy

[formula]

are related to the eigenvalues of the sine-square potential as given by equation ([\ref=eq22]). These relations are easily derived and are given explicitly by

[formula]

double-cosine potential

In this section, we consider a single particle in the double cosine potential [\cite=Hai],

[formula]

and obeys the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

The maximum of the potential ([\ref=eq53]) occurs within the given interval between x = 0 and x = 2π and has the value of Vmax = V1 + V2, while the minimum occurs at x = π with the value of Vmin = V2 - V1. Clearly, if V1 = 0 and V2 > 0, the problem corresponds to Mathieu's equation [\cite=mclachlan]. Assume the general solution of the differential equation ([\ref=eq54]) that satisfies the boundary conditions takes the form [formula]. Then direct substitution, using equation [\eqref=eq54], yields the second order differential equation for f(x) as

[formula]

Assuming, further, that

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

where we have used the trigonometric identity cos (x) =  - 1 + 2 cos 2(x / 2). Finally with the substitution y =  cos (x  /  2) we obtain

[formula]

Clearly we have the exact solution

[formula]

that is

[formula]

For excited states we have applied the asymptotic iteration method that we used with

[formula]

and a starting value of y0 = 0 corresponding to the minimum of the double-cosine potential at x0  =  π. In Table [\ref=table:Tab3] we report the first few excited states along with the iteration number used by the asymptotic iteration method. All the eigenvalues are accurate for the given number of decimals shown and can easily be obtained with any desired precision.

This work can be easily extended to study the Schrödinger equation with the periodic potential

[formula]

with rigid walls at the boundaries. A simple scaling argument x  →  σx with σ = k shows that

[formula]

so that we can easily compare with our earlier work concerning equation [\eqref=eq54], where in this case

[formula]

Tangent-squared potential

Recently, Taeli [\cite=tac] studied the squared tangent potential V(x) = ν(ν - 1) tan 2(x), ~ x∈( - π / 2,π / 2) also known as the symmetric Pöschl-Teller potential [\cite=nieto] [\cite=gori]. It was noted that the energy eigenvalues, but not the eigenfunctions, of the Hamiltonian with the squared tangent potential on the symmetric interval ( - π / 2,π / 2) are precisely the same as those of the Hamiltonian with the squared cotangent potential V(x) = ν(ν - 1) cot 2x on the asymmetric interval (0,π) considered by Marmorino in [\cite=mar] (see also [\cite=ma]). This observation can be easily verified using the identity

[formula]

In this section, we will used the asymptotic iteration method to study the Schrödinger equation with the confining potential contained within an infinite square well with sides at x =   ±    ~  πa  /  2 and V0 gives an indication of how rapidly the potential increases within the well. In this case, the time-independent Schrödinger equation reads

[formula]

We, however, take a slightly different approach to solve [\eqref=eq66] by letting the wave function assume the form

[formula]

that satisfies the boundary conditions of [\eqref=eq66]. Again it is straightforward to verify that the substitution of ([\ref=eq67]) into ([\ref=eq66]), yields a differential equation for f(x) as

[formula]

A further change of variable x = a arcsin (y) implies

[formula]

and, with the substitution

[formula]

we finally obtain for g(y)

[formula]

where we set ω = 1 - a2E, μ = a2V0 and [formula] This differential equation is an example of an exactly solvable problem solved by means of the asymptotic iteration method. Indeed, with

[formula]

the termination condition [\eqref=eq9], [formula] yields

[formula]

and in general Thus the energy eigenvalues are given by

[formula]

For the analytic solution of gn(y), we note by equation (6) that

[formula]

These polynomial solutions are easily generated by

[formula]

up to a multiplicative constant. Here, the Gauss hypergeometric function [formula] is defined by [\cite=andrews]

[formula]

and (λ)k denotes the Pochhammer symbol defined, in terms of Gamma functions, by

[formula]

Thus the exact analytic solutions of Schrödinger's equation ([\ref=eq66]) is

[formula]

where An is a normalization factor. Clearly, for V0 = 0 we obtain the exact solutions for the rigid box ([\ref=eq29]). Using the trigonometric identity

[formula]

we can easily obtain the energy eigenvalues for the Schrödinger equation

[formula]

where

[formula]

Using a simple scaling argument x  →  ax, we can write [\eqref=eq77] as

[formula]

where U0 = a2V0 and [formula] Using the identity

[formula]

we can write [\eqref=eq79] as

[formula]

Complex Cotangent potential well

In this section we discuss a quasi-exact trigonometric potential model with complex coefficients [\cite=com],

[formula]

We show that the asymptotic iteration method can provides the necessary conditions under which the one dimensional Schrödinger equation

[formula]

has exact (analytic) solutions. To this end we assume that the wave function ψ(x) takes the form

[formula]

which yields, up on substituting into equation [\eqref=eq83], the following differential equation for f(x)

[formula]

wherein V0 = iv the change of variable y =  cot (x  /  a) allows us to write ([\ref=eq85]) as

[formula]

and finally, using the substitution

[formula]

where α and β are constants to be determine shortly, we obtain

[formula]

To solving this equation we note first that

[formula]

which yields

[formula]

Thus with

[formula]

we obtain a more compact form of the second order linear differential equation for g(x) as

[formula]

The asymptotic iteration method can then be applied with

[formula]

to yield, by means of the termination condition [\eqref=eq9], the following condition for an exact solution

[formula]

The (analytic) polynomial solutions are given, using [\eqref=eq6], explicitly as

[formula]

The recurrence relation to generate these polynomial solution is given by

[formula]

initiated with

[formula]

In terms of the hypergeometric functions, the polynomial solutions can be written, are

[formula]

The normalization condition Cn can be computed using

[formula]

which is valid for [formula] where δnm = 0 for n  ≠  m and δnm = 1 for n = m.

Conclusion

We have applied AIM to solve Schrödinger's equation with a number of confining trigonometric potentials. When a termination condition is satisfied, the method yields exact analytical solutions. In other cases approximations are found either by a direct application of AIM or by using the method to find exact expressions for the terms in a perturbation expansion. In particular, our results lead to a new exactly solvable problem with a complex cotangent potential which is infinite outside the interval [formula]. in The asymptotic iteration method can be applied to a wide variety of one-dimensional or spherically symmetric quantum potentials defined on infinite or semi-infinite domains. In the present work, the method is applied to a number of quantum (trigonometric) potentials defined on finite domains
