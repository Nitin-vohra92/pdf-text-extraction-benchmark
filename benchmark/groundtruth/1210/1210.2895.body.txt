Strong polaritonic interaction between flux-flow and phonon resonances in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + x intrinsic Josephson junctions: Angular dependence and the alignment procedure.

Intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) [\cite=Kleiner94] in high temperature superconductors are considered as possible candidates for realization of high power THz-frequency radiation sources [\cite=Ozyuzer] [\cite=Wang] [\cite=Cascade] [\cite=Klemm2010] [\cite=Hu] [\cite=FiskeTheory]. IJJs can provide several advantages: (i) A large number of IJJs can easily be integrated. A strong superradiant emission can take place if all IJJs are phase-locked in the symmetric in-phase mode. (ii) Due to the large energy gap in Bi-2212 [formula] [\cite=SecondOrder], IJJs can comfortably operate in the frequency range up to [formula]. (iii) Stacking of IJJs may lead to cascade amplification of non-equilibrium population, needed for achieving population inversion and lasing [\cite=Cascade]. (iv) A large variety of emission mechanisms are available. The ac-Josephson effect facilitates electromagnetic wave emission via fluxon-induced self-oscillations at geometrical resonances [\cite=Hu] [\cite=SelfOscill], or via the Josephson flux-flow emission [\cite=FiskeTheory] [\cite=Superluminal]. Besides, coherent phonon emission can take place either without the ac-Josephson effect via recombination of non-equilibrium quasiparticles [\cite=Cascade], or via the ac-Josephson effect due to the electrostriction phenomenon [\cite=Polariton].

In this work we investigate the mutual interaction between phonons and electromagnetic waves in the flux-flow state of small Bi-2212 mesa structures. The ac-Josephson effect leads to excitation of c-axis optical phonons in Bi-2212 single crystal by means of electrostriction: Ions in the polar insulating SrO-2BiO-SrO layers, where the oscillating electric field is concentrated, are shaken at the Josephson frequency. Both Raman and infrared (IR) - active c-axis phonons can be excited [\cite=Schlen] [\cite=Ponomarev] [\cite=Polariton]. The symmetry of the phonon is directly related to the symmetry of the electromagnetic mode: Raman phonons are excited by the out-of-phase mode, while infrared-active phonons are excited by the in-phase mode. The strongest interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons occurs at the transverse optical phonon frequency. This leads to formation of phonon-polaritons with very slow group velocities. We argue that resonances with IR-active phonons can stabilize the in-phase electromagnetic mode in IJJs, needed for achieving coherent superradiant flux-flow emission from Bi-2212 mesas. The appearance of phonon-polaritons also demonstrates the existence of an unscreened polar response, which may lead to the strong electron-phonon coupling in cuprates.

We study small mesa structures, made at the surface of freshly cleaved Bi-2212 single crystals. Mesas are made by photolithography, argon milling and focused ion beam trimming down to sub-micron sizes. Two types of crystals are studied: slightly underdoped pure Bi-2212 crystals with [formula] and slightly overdoped lead-doped Bi2 - yPbySr2CaCu2O8 + x (Bi(Pb)-2212) crystals with [formula]. The most noticeable difference between those crystals is in the critical current density, which is an order of magnitude larger for Bi(Pb)-2212 ([formula]). Since the amplitudes of the phonon resonance, reported below, are proportional to [formula] [\cite=Heim], they are much more pronounced in Bi(Pb)-2212 crystals [\cite=Polariton]. In order to avoid repetitions we address the reader to our previous works, in which we studied properties of similar mesas in intense magnetic fields, including: the Fraunhofer modulation of the Josephson current [\cite=Katterwe], velocity matching (Eck), geometrical (Fiske) [\cite=Superluminal] and phonon-polariton [\cite=Polariton] resonances in the flux-flow state, their temperature dependence [\cite=TempDep] and the intrinsic tunneling magnetoresistance of IJJs [\cite=MR]. Below we will focus on the angular dependence and describe the procedure for accurate sample alignment, which is a prerequisite for observation of high quality resonances.

Figure [\ref=fig1] represents the angular dependence of the current-voltage characteristic of the Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa P22/m5b with the area [formula], containing N≃11 IJJs. For the field parallel to the ab-plane, (a) α = 0, the quasiparticle (QP) branches are completely suppressed and a pronounced flux-flow step appears at [formula]. It corresponds to the Eck resonance, when the speed of propagating Josephson vortices (fluxons) is equal to the speed of the slowest out-of-phase electromagnetic wave [\cite=Superluminal] [\cite=Polariton] [\cite=TempDep]. Strong hysteretic resonances above the Eck step at higher voltages, [formula] [formula], are due to excitation of c-axis optical phonons [\cite=Schlen] [\cite=Heim] [\cite=Preis] [\cite=Ponomarev] [\cite=Polariton]. Already at a slight misalignment of the field by 1-2 degrees (b, c) the resonances are strongly dampened due to penetration of Abrikosov vortices. The amount of Abrikosov vortices increases with further increase of the angle (d), they effectively pin Josephson fluxons, which leads to a significant increase of the critical current, suppression of the flux-flow and a reappearance of QP branches (d, e). With further increase of the angle the amount of Abrikosov vortices becomes so large that their normal cores start to suppress the superconducting order parameter. This results in the pronounced negative magnetoresistance [\cite=MR] and the suppression of the critical current (f-h).

Figure [\ref=fig2] represents differential conductance curves [formula] versus voltage per junction V / N for another Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa (P22/m4a 1.2  ×  2.0  ~  μm2, N≃55) for field along the ab-plane and in the c-axis direction. Phonon resonances are seen as peaks in [formula] for a field along the ab-plane. They completely disappear for field in the c-axis direction, clearly showing the importance of sample alignment.

Table [\ref=tab:phonons] summarizes all observed phonon resonances for the Bi(Pb)-2212 crystal. In total fourteen phonon resonances with varying amplitudes could be distinguished. This is consistent with the expected number of c-axis optical phonons in the tetragonal Bi-2212 (seven IR and seven Raman) [\cite=Kovaleva]. Indeed, by comparison with optical spectroscopy [\cite=Kovaleva], most of the observed phonons are easily identified with the known Raman and IR-active c-axis optical phonons [\cite=Schlen] [\cite=Ponomarev] [\cite=Polariton]. Few unidentified phonons may be disorder induced, due to the orthorhombic distortion, or the incommensurate superstructure in the crystal [\cite=Kovaleva].

From Fig. [\ref=fig1] it is obvious that an accurate sample alignment is essential for the study of phonon resonances in intense fields. Therefore we want to describe the developed unambiguous alignment procedure in more details. Figure [\ref=fig3] shows the angular dependence of the dc-resistances [formula], measured at different probe currents I (a) low [formula], (b) moderate [formula] and (c) high [formula] for the Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa P22/m3 at [formula] and at three different magnetic fields. The angular dependence of the magnetoresistance can be understood from I-Vs in Fig. [\ref=fig1]. The sharp maximum at α = 0 is caused by the flux-flow contribution. The flux-flow voltage is rapidly suppressed at small a misalignment [formula] due to the pinning by Abrikosov vortices. At larger angles the magnetoresistance strongly depends on the bias: at a low bias the resistance increases due to the suppression of the critical current, but at a higher bias it is monotonously decreasing due to the negative QP magnetoresistance [\cite=MR] [\cite=Bulaevskii].

Even though the sharp flux-flow peak at low bias seems to be advantageous for the sample alignment, we found that such an alignment is unreliable because of the field lock-in along the ab-plane, which may lead to a hysteresis up to a few degrees [\cite=LockIn]. In Fig. [\ref=fig3] (a) it can be seen as a slight asymmetry of the minima in the [formula] curve at [formula]. With increasing field the angular range of the hysteresis decreases. At [formula] it is only [formula]. However this corresponds to almost 500 G c-axis field that is sufficient for penetration of Abrikosov vortices. Therefore the low bias alignment is not good enough. On the other hand, we observed that the alignment at high bias, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig3] (c), is working much better because it is free from the hysteresis. This is caused by an effective depinnig of Abrikosov (pancake) vortices as a combination of self-heating that leads to thermal-assisted flux creep, a gradient force due to perpendicular magnetization in pancake vortices with respect to applied field and a drag force from Josephson vortices. Furthermore, the maxima [formula] become significantly sharper at high bias. For the curves at [formula] the full width at half maximum is [formula] at low bias, Fig. [\ref=fig3] (a), compared to only [formula] at high bias, Fig. [\ref=fig3] (c). Therefore we use high bias magnetoresistance for the accurate sample alignment.

Figure [\ref=fig4] shows the measured critical current vs the in-plane magnetic field for (a,b) a moderate size Bi-2212 mesa and (c) a small Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa P22/m4a. A clear Fraunhofer modulation is seen in Figs. [\ref=fig4] (a) and (c). A transition from the half flux quantum to the flux quantum Φ0 periodicity occurs with increasing field due to the reconstruction of the Josephson fluxon lattice from the triangular to the rectangular [\cite=Katterwe] [\cite=Koshelev]. Panel (b) shows [formula] for the same mesa and alignment as in (a) after subjecting the sample to a larger field [formula]. Apparently, the Fraunhofer modulation is completely destroyed by the intrusion of Abrikosov vortices. In Fig. [\ref=fig4] (c) the Fraunhofer modulation persists up to 13 T, demonstrating that with our rigorous alignment procedure we can prevent Abrikosov vortex intrusion even at very high fields.

Figure [\ref=fig5] shows the I-V oscillogram for the Bi(Pb)-2212 mesa P22/m5b at [formula] in the in-plane magnetic field of 10 T. Here a flux-flow branch ending with a nearly vertical Eck resonance is clearly seen. Above it a large variety of phonon resonances appears. Those resonances are divided into groups of N = 11 branches due to one-by-one switching of IJJs into the resonant state. For clarity we painted different families of branches by different colors.

Figure [\ref=fig6] (a) represents the magnetic field dependencies of collective resonance voltages (all junctions at the same resonance) for one of the studied Bi(Pb)-2212 mesas. Positions of all fourteen phonon resonances are indicated by dotted lines. As discussed in Ref. [\cite=Polariton], the V(H) plot can be translated into the dispersion relation with the frequency given by the ac-Josephson relation and the wave length by the periodicity of the Josephson fluxon lattice:

[formula]

where [formula] is the stacking periodicity of Bi-2212. Therefore the V-H plot represents the dispersion relation of electromagnetic waves in the mesa. The lowest branch (black) represents the Eck resonance. Initially it increases linearly with field, corresponding to the constant speed of electromagnetic waves [formula], close to the out-of-phase speed [\cite=Superluminal]. However, at [formula] it saturates upon approaching the second phonon mode. At this point the group velocity of electromagnetic waves becomes very slow. This is a well known signature for formation of phonon-polaritons with the transverse optical phonon [\cite=Preis].

The polaronic dispersion relation is determined by the dielectric function, which is influenced by the interaction of propagating electromagnetic waves in the dielectric barrier with optical phonons:

[formula]

Here [formula] are frequencies of transverse optical phonons, Sj and γj are the corresponding oscillator strength and the damping parameter, respectively.

Figure [\ref=fig6] (c) shows a simulated dielectric function with characteristic phonon frequencies aligned to the positions of the fourteen observed resonances. The oscillator strengths were chosen so that [formula] is equal to the experimental value ~  10 and damping parameters were chosen so that the corresponding dispersion relation [formula], shown in Fig. [\ref=fig6] (b) is looking alike the experimental data in Fig. [\ref=fig6] (a). Figure [\ref=fig6] (b) shows the obtained dispersion relation for positive group velocities with scales in frequency and the wave number corresponding to voltage and field scales in Fig. [\ref=fig6] (a) according to Eqs. ([\ref=Eq1]) and ([\ref=Eq2]). Even though Fig. [\ref=fig6] (b) is not meant to be a direct fit to Fig. [\ref=fig6] (a), it demonstrates that peculiarities of experimentally observed V(H) characteristics can be fairly well explained by the simple expression Eq. ([\ref=eq:epsilon]). In particular, the saturation of V(H) and small group velocities are caused by the divergence of the dielectric function when the ac-Josephson frequency is approaching any of the active transverse-optical phonon frequencies. Also an abrupt jump-like cancellation of resonances at higher voltages (see Fig. [\ref=fig5]) is caused by the negative value of ε, which prevents propagation of electromagnetic waves with such frequencies and leads to switching of I-Vs from the resonant flux-flow to the non-resonant quasiparticle state.

In conclusion, we have described the accurate alignment procedure and the angular dependence of phonon-polariton resonances between electromagnetic waves, generated in the flux-flow state, and c-axis optical phonons in Bi-2212 single crystals. The phenomenon is caused by electrostriction in the insulating SrO-2BiO-SrO layers. Our work has several implications. For realization of the coherent flux-flow oscillator it is necessary to stabilize the in-phase state with the rectangular Josephson fluxon lattice, which is usually unstable because of fluxon-fluxon repulsion. Strong interaction with infrared optical phonons can stabilize the in-phase state. The stabilizing role of phonons is seen already from the fact that we observed the flux-flow phenomenon up to the record high frequencies [formula], see Fig. [\ref=fig6] (a) and (b). Formation of phonon-polaritons demonstrates also that a residual polar response is left in cuprates even in the superconducting state. This demonstrates that Bi-2212 single crystals represent natural atomic metamaterials composed of two-dimensional superconducting CuO2-Ca-CuO2 layers stacked with polar insulating SrO-2BiO-SrO. This can lead to an extraordinary strong electron-phonon coupling due to the combination of a long range Coulomb interaction in 2D metallic planes with an unscreened polar response in the adjacent polar insulator layers. This may have significance for understanding the pairing mechanism in cuprate superconductors.
