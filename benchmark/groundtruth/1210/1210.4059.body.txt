Band-filling and correlation controlling electronic properties and magnetism in KxFe2 - ySe2: A slave boson study

INTRODUCTION

Recently a new iron selenide superconductor KxFe2 - ySe2 with [formula] above 30 K [\cite=PRB82-180520] has attracted considerable attention for its unique high Néel transition temperature and insulating properties, as well as the presence of intrinsic Fe-vacancy ordering [\cite=EPL94-27009] [\cite=PRB83-140505R] [\cite=CPL28-086104] [\cite=PRL107-137003], quite different from the other iron-based superconducting materials. These unusual properties arise an assumption that KxFe2 - ySe2 may be a strongly correlated system. KFe2Se2 is isostructural to the 122 system, e.g. BaFe2As2, but chemically is close to FeSe. On average there are 6.5 electrons with equal ratio of Fe2 + and Fe+ in KFe2Se2, rather than 6 ones in the iron-pnictide parent compounds with solely Fe2 +. Therefore it can be regarded as an electron overdoped 11 system, in contrast to the underdoped KFe2As2 which has 5.5 electrons with equal ratio of Fe2 + and Fe3 +, and FeAs which has 5 ones with Fe3 +. As a consequence, only the electron Fermi surface (FS) pockets exist around the M points in KFe2Se2, as observed in recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [\cite=nmat10-273] [\cite=PRL106-187001] and in electronic structure calculations [\cite=PRB84-054502] [\cite=CPL28-057402]. Thus, the FS nesting between the hole pocket around the [formula] point and the electron pocket around the M point, which widely exists in FeAs-based materials, is absent in KFe2Se2 compound.

Due to its unique electronic structure properties, the magnetic properties of KxFe2 - ySe2 are focused on. Because of the difficulty of single crystal preparation for pure AFe2Se2 (A=K, Tl, Rb, or Cs), its magnetic properties are mainly studied theoretically, but still a debating issue, as addressed in what follows: the local density approximation (LDA) calculations suggested that KFe2Se2 is a striped antiferromagnetic (SAFM) order, same to the 1111 and 122 phases of the FeAs-based materials [\cite=CPL28-057402]; while some others [\cite=PRB84-054502] thought it to be bi-collinear AFM with (π/2, π/2) wave-vector, similar to FeTe [\cite=PRL102-247001]. However, the LDA calculations suggested that TlFe2Se2 is a checkerboard AFM (π, π) order [\cite=PRB79-094528], and the dynamical spin susceptibility obtained within random phase approximation (RPA) also suggested the (π, π) instability in KFe2Se2 [\cite=physicab407-1139] [\cite=PRB83-100515R]. These discrepant results show that further investigations on the magnetism are deserved to understand the unique properties in AFe2Se2 (A=K, Tl, Rb, or Cs) compounds.

Many recent experiments [\cite=nphys8-126] [\cite=SR2-212] [\cite=PRX1-021020] [\cite=PRB83-184521] [\cite=PRB85-094512] [\cite=SR2-221] [\cite=arXiv1203.1533] reported the wide existence of the phase separation in KxFe2 - ySe2 materials. A scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiment demonstrated the phase-separated component KFe2Se2 is the parent phase contributing to the superconductivity, and K0.8Fe1.6Se2 component is an Fe-vacancy order insulator [\cite=nphys8-126], implying that pure KFe2Se2 in the normal state is more possibly a paramagnetic (PM) phase. One may notice that different K contents in KxFe2 - ySe2 lead to different band fillings of Fe 3d orbitals, hence to quite different electronic and magnetic properties. Further Chen et al. reported that the electronic states and magnetic phase diagrams of KxFe2 - ySe2 system are closely connected with the Fe valences [\cite=SR2-212]. We also notice that various theoretical magnetic configurations obtained within the first-principles calculations for AFe2Se2 (A=K, Tl, Rb, or Cs) do not include the Coulomb correlation correction [\cite=CPL28-057402] [\cite=PRB84-054502] [\cite=PRB79-094528], which implies a weak electronic correlation in AFe2Se2, in contrast with the intermediate electronic correlation in the FeAs-based compounds [\cite=JPCM24-085603]. Thus a few of questions are urgent to be answered: what is the realistic electron filling ? Moreover how does the band filling affect the electronic properties and magnetism in KxFe2 - ySe2 ? Considering that KFe2Se2 is a possible parent phase of superconducting state, we will focus on KxFe2 - ySe2 system in the absence of ordered Fe vacancy at various electron fillings throughout this paper.

In this paper, to uncover the role of electronic correlation on the groundstate properties of AFe2Se2, we adopt Kotliar-Ruckenstein's slave boson (KRSB) mean field approach [\cite=PRL57-1362] [\cite=JPCM24-085603] [\cite=EPJB85-55] to study the magnetic and electronic properties at different band fillings in K-doped iron selenides. Based on our previous LDA calculation results [\cite=physicab407-1139], we first present an effective three-orbital model for KFe2Se2, and then determine the ground states of this model at different electron fillings. We show that the ground state of KxFe2 - ySe2 at fillings of 3/4, 2/3 and a half is a PM metallic phase, a SAFM with orbital ordering, and a Néel AFM one without orbital ordering in the intermediate and strong correlation regimes in addition to an orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP) related with an intermediate-spin to high-spin transition, respectively, showing that the band filling controls not only the FS topology, but also the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe-based superconducting materials. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: a three-orbital tight-binding model and the multi-orbital slave-boson mean-field approach are presented in Sec. II; the numerical results and discussions are shown in Sec. III; the last section is devoted to the remarks and summary.

Three-orbital tight-binding model and slave boson approach

Based on our previous electronic structure calculations [\cite=physicab407-1139], we find that FS is mainly contributed by three [formula] orbitals, thus the system can be described by a three-orbital model, similar to iron pnictides [\cite=PRB78-144517] [\cite=PRB79-054504] [\cite=PRB79-064517] [\cite=PRB81-014511]. We extract an effective three-orbital tight-binding model from our LDA band structures. The tight-binding model Hamiltonian for the three-orbital model in the momentum space is described as,

[formula]

where Tαβ() is the kinetic energy term, εα denotes the on-site energy of the α orbital, and μ is the chemical potential determined by the electron filling. The three-orbital tight-binding fitting of the Fe-3[formula] bands is displayed in the solid lines, in comparison with the original five bands [\cite=physicab407-1139] in the dot lines, as shown in Fig. 1. It is obviously found that the band structures in KFe2Se2 are similar to that of LaFeAsO [\cite=PRL105-096401], only the position of Fermi energy EF is shifted. Therefore this model can describe both the FeSe-based and FeAs-based systems through changing the chemical potential.

The tight-binding parameters of the three-orbital model for KFe2Se2 are listed in the following. The on-site energies measured from the Fermi energy for the three orbitals are (ε1,ε2,ε3)= (-  511.92, -  511.92, -  341.63), respectively, in units of meV. Here orbital indices (1, 2, 3) indicate the [formula], [formula], and [formula] components, respectively. Similar to BaFe2As2 [\cite=PRB81-214503], the orbital-dependent kinetic energy matrix elements are expressed in terms of the inter-obrital and intra-orbital hopping integrals as follows,

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

The intra-orbital and inter-orbital hopping parameters up to the fifth nearest-neighbor for the fitting of the three-band structure in Fig. 1 are shown in Table I.

Considering the Coulomb interaction, in addition to the kinetic term in Eq. (1), we describe the electronic interaction part of the multi-orbital Hamiltonian as follows,

[formula]

where [formula](') denotes the intra-(inter-)orbital Coulomb repulsion interaction and [formula] the Hund's rule coupling. Considering the rotation symmetry of the system, we adopt '=[formula]-2[formula].

We notice that in FeAs-based materials, the electronic filling for the present three-orbital model is only at two-third filling, i.e. [formula]=4, the correct FS can be reproduced [\cite=PRB79-064517] [\cite=PRB81-014511] [\cite=PRL105-096401]. In KFe2Se2 compound, the Fe ions have two kinds of valence, Fe2 + and Fe+ with equal ratio, and the average electron number is 6.5 per site, different from Fe2 + with 6 electrons in FeAs-based parent materials. Consequently, pure KFe2Se2 should be at a filling of three quarters (i.e. [formula]=4.5) at which the FS can be reproduced correctly in the present three-orbital model. The obtained FS of KFe2Se2 is plotted at kz=0 in Fig. 1, with four electron-like FS pockets. The hole-like FS pockets at [formula] are absent. Such a FS topology is in agreement with the recent ARPES experiments [\cite=nmat10-273] [\cite=PRL106-187001] and the band structure calculations [\cite=PRB84-054502] [\cite=CPL28-057402]. To explore the band filling dependence of the electronic state, we also extend the band filling to 2/3 and half, which corresponds to the Fe2 + and Fe3 + systems, respectively.

KRSB mean field approach is known as one of the effective methods to treat the wide electronic correlation in the many-body systems. Here, we extend the single-orbital KRSB mean-field method to the multi-orbital situation [\cite=JPCM24-085603] [\cite=EPJB85-55] and apply it on KxFe2 - ySe2. We introduce new fermion operators [formula] slaved by boson operators [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula], which represent the empty, single occupation with α orbital and σ spin, double occupation with β orbital spin σβ and γ orbital spin σγ, double occupation with two electrons in orbital α, triplicate occupation with two electrons in orbital α and one electron in orbital β with spin σ, triplicate occupation with each electron in orbital α, β and γ with spin σα, σβ, and σγ, quaternity occupation with two electrons in orbital β and γ, quaternity occupation with two electrons in orbital α, one electron in orbital β with spin σβ and one electron in orbital γ with spin σγ, fivefold occupation with four electrons in orbitals β and γ, and one electron in orbital α with spin σ, and sixfold occupation, respectively.

The completeness of these boson fields gives rise to the normalization condition as follows:

[formula]

Projecting the original Hamiltonian Eqs. (1) and (2) into the new slave-boson representation, the multi-orbital Hubbard model Hamiltonian is described as:

[formula]

where the renormalization factor

[formula]

[formula]

The corresponding Fermion number constraint for α orbital with spin σ reads:

[formula]

where

[formula]

Averaging the boson operators in Eq.(4)-(8), we can obtain an effective mean filed Hamiltonian, hence the total ground-state energy. The original fermions are guaranteed by the constraints Eq.([\ref=eq:pnc]), which are implemented by means of the corresponding generalized Lagrange multiplier method. In order to determine the stable magnetic ground state, we minimize the total energies for different magnetic configurations based on the pattern search method. To simplify the calculations, various symmetries should be utilized. For instance, in the AFM situation with two sublattices, the single occupation probabilities [formula] in sublattice B are identical to [formula] in sublattice A, double occupation probabilities [formula] =[formula], etc..

Results and discussions

In this section, we present main numerical results on the electronic and magnetic properties within the three-orbital model for iron selenide systems. The fillings of three quarters and two thirds, as well as half-filling, are all considered for comparison.

Three-quarter filling case

We firstly consider the electron filling [formula]=4.5 case, corresponding to pure KFe2Se2 compounds. Note that we adopt the hole representation for convenience within KRSB mean field approach throughout this paper. Thus the particle number at the three-quarter filling case is 1.5 within the three-orbital model. Taking into account several types of magnetic configurations with high symmetry, the PM, ferromagnetic (FM), Néel AFM and SAFM cases, we find that only the PM phase is the most stable at a filling of three quarters when [formula] increases from 0 up to 5 eV. Because of the mixing valence of Fe2 + and Fe+ in KFe2Se2, the system is not a magnetic ordered and insulating state in the homogenous phase. Since the electron fillings of both Fe2 + and Fe+ are away from half filling, unlike mixing valent Na0.5CoO2 [\cite=PRL92-247001], KFe2Se2 does not form charge ordering. Previous work on charge susceptibility shows that the Coulomb interaction suppresses the charge instability [\cite=physicab407-1139] [\cite=PRB84-184521], thus it is hard to form charge ordering in KFe2Se2.

Within the present KRSB framework, the dependence of various boson occupancies on the Coulomb interaction [formula] at [formula]=0.25[formula] is plotted in Fig. 2. It is clearly found that the empty occupation [formula], single occupation 3 and double occupation 3 with orbital [formula] are dominant for small U. With the increase of the Coulomb interaction, the empty occupation [formula] and triple occupation 3 decrease sharply, while 11, 12 and 13 (1α=[formula]=[formula]) increase due to the increasing of the Hund's rule coupling and the Coulomb interaction. This shows that the system is a PM and the magnetic moment of each Fe spin increases with the lift of [formula] and JH, rather than a nonmagnetic one.

The orbital occupations as a function of the Coulomb interaction are given in the left panel of Fig. 3. It is obviously found that the electrons are occupied at the lower energy [formula]- and [formula]-orbitals. And there is no orbital polarization between the [formula]- and [formula]-orbitals. With the increase of Coulomb interaction, a fraction of electrons in the [formula]- and [formula]-orbitals transfer to higher energy [formula]-orbital since larger JH enhances the effect of the Hund's rule. Thus the high energy [formula] orbital occupies more electrons as JH increases. The renormalization factors of each orbital as a function of the Coulomb interaction [formula] are shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. With the increase of Coulomb interaction, the bandwidths of the three orbitals become narrower and narrower, and the renormalization factors become small. We notice that in the PM phase, the degeneracy of orbital [formula] and [formula] is not removed, and the renormalization factors of bandwidths in different orbitals are nearly the same. When [formula] is 3, 4 and 5 eV, the renormalization factor [formula] is about 0.85, 0.8 and 0.76, respectively, giving rise to the band mass of original fermions mb / m = 1 / Z2 ~   1.38, 1.56 and 1.73, respectively, and yielding a mass renormaization factor of about 2 at [formula]=5 eV. We expect that the disorder effect and the spin fluctuations beyond the KRSB mean field approximation will further narrow the bandwidths and enhance the effective mass. This band narrowing factor is comparable with the experimental ones from ARPES [\cite=PRB80-165115] and de Haas-Van Alphen [\cite=PRL104-057008], indicating that KFe2Se2 lies in the intermediate correlation region, similar to the FeAs-based systems. While in the presence of the Fe-vacancy, the measured renormalization factor is about 6.1 in (Tl,Rb)xFe2 - ySe2, greatly larger than 2. This shows that most probably the insulating properties in KxFe2 - ySe2 systems are induced by the ordering of Fe vacancies, rather than by the strong electronic correlation.

The projected densities of states (PDOS) of KFe2Se2 for the Coulomb interaction [formula]=0, 1, 3 and 5 eV are shown in Fig. 4. The finite DOS at FS shows a pseudo-gap-like structure, and there is no obvious van Hove singularity. Nevertheless in FeAs-based compounds, a considerable van Hove singularities in the DOS is attributed to the FS nesting with wave vector [formula]=(π, 0) [\cite=PRB77-220503R]. Therefore, the absence of the van Hove singularities in the DOS of KFe2Se2 may be the consequence of the breakdown of the FS nesting, which arises from the fact that there lacks the hole pockets around [formula] point. With the increase of the Coulomb interaction from 0 to 5 eV, the bandwidth becomes narrow, [formula] ~   2.5 eV at [formula]=3 eV, smaller than 3.2 eV at [formula]=0, showing that the system is a correlated bad metal and is in the intermediate correlation region with   ~  .

Through the analysis above, we find that at 3/4 filling, the KxFe2 - ySe2 system, corresponding to KFe2Se2, is a PM phase. We also clarify that KFe2Se2 lies in intermediate correlation region, similar to the FeAs-based compounds.

Two-third filling case

On the other hand, the electron filling at [formula]=4 corresponds to Fe2 +-based compounds, such as FeSe and LaFeAsO, etc.. The dependence of boson occupancy probabilities on the Coulomb interaction is also shown in Fig. 5. Comparing with [formula]=4.5 case, we find that with the increase of [formula], the system transits from a PM metallic phase to a SAFM metallic one at a critical point [formula]1.2 eV. In the PM phase, the single occupations in the [formula]-orbital p3 and empty occupancy e are dominant. Other multiple occupation states also contribute small but finite weights. While in the SAFM phase, the single, double and triple occupations with the same spin alignment, [formula], [formula] and [formula], are dominant. The spin singlet and small spin states contribute very little. With increasing the Hund's rule coupling, the empty and single occupations continuously decrease, while the double and triple ones considerably increase. This behavior arises from the fact that the increase of Coulomb interaction favors the formation of the SAFM phase, and large Hund's rule coupling favors large spin state.

The gap opening behavior of the SDW states in the multi-orbital FeAs-based system is an interesting but unsolved topic. In order to resolve the behavior of the SDW gap opening in KxFe2 - ySe2, we present the band dispersions of the PM and SDW states in Fig. 6. We find that in the SDW states, only partial SDW gaps open near EF in comparison with PM states, which is the consequence of the the band narrowing and spin splitting, similar to FeAs-based compounds. The partial opening of SDW gap indicates the system is a bad metal.

The dependence of orbital occupations and magnetic moment of each orbital on the Coulomb interaction [formula] is also shown in Fig. 7. With the increase of [formula], once the system enters the SAFM phase, there is obvious orbital polarization between [formula] and [formula] orbitals together with   <   in the electronic representation. And the magnetic moments on the [formula] and [formula] orbitals are different with mxz > myz. These are consistent with the previous LaFeAsO results [\cite=PRB84-064435] [\cite=JPCM24-085603]. The renormalization factors [formula] displayed in the right panel of Fig. 7 show that the [formula], [formula] and [formula] become smaller and smaller with [formula] [formula] when [formula] increases. This indicates that the SDW gap opening mainly occurs in the [formula]/[formula] orbitals.

The evolution of the PDOS with Coulomb interactions [formula] is also displayed in Fig. 8. We find that at [formula]=2.0 eV and 3.0 eV, there exhibit obvious spin polarizations in SAFM phase due to the breakdown of spin symmetry. The [formula]- and [formula]- orbitals dominate the FS, while the [formula] orbital mainly lies far from the Fermi levels. This also shows that the [formula]/[formula] orbitals determine the electronic properties near EF, and mainly involve with the formation of the SDW states, consistent with the result of renormalization factor in Fig. 7.

Since the electronic correlation is intermediate, one expects that U is larger than 2 eV in iron pnictides and selenides; thus at 2/3 filling, the SAFM state with orbital ordering is stable over a wide electron correlation range, from intermediate to strong correlations, which is similar to the FeAs-based systems.

Half-filling case

When turning to the half-filling case, which corresponds to the Fe3 +-based systems, such as KFeSe2 and FeAs compounds, etc., we find that the phase diagram becomes much richer. It is found that there exist three critical points when U increases: the system transits from a PM metal to an SAFM metal at Uc1, from an SAFM metal to a Néel AFM metallic phase at Uc2, and from an AFM metal with intermediate-spin state to an AFM OSMP with high-spin state at Uc3, as shown in Fig. 9. These phases will be addressed in detail in the following. In comparison with [formula]=4.5 and 4 cases, we find that besides the PM and SAFM phases, the Néel AFM metallic phase appears in slightly large [formula] region at Uc2  ≈  0.8 eV. Only when in the narrow Coulomb interaction region at Uc1  ≈  0.65<  U  <   Uc2, the SAFM phase is stable, as the dependence of the boson occupancies on Coulomb interaction [formula] showing in Fig. 9. With the increase of the Coulomb interaction, the triple occupation [formula] sharply increases, while the other high occupations are relatively small. This shows that the system undergoes a spin state transition with the increase of the Coulomb interaction and the Hund's rule coupling, as we see the low-spin (S=1/2) to intermediate-spin (S=1) transition at Uc2 in Fig. 10.

On the other hand, the dependence of the orbital occupations and the magnetic moments of three orbitals on Coulomb interaction [formula] is plotted in the left panel of Fig. 10. We find that in the SAFM phase, a small orbital polarization appears with   >   in the present hole representation, i.e.   >   in the electron representation. This supports the itinerant orbital ordering in the parent phases of iron pnictides [\cite=PRB84-064435] [\cite=EPJB85-55]. Meanwhile the magnetic moments on different orbitals possess   <   with total magnetic moment mtot  <  1μB. The system lies in a low-spin state. However, in the Néel AFM metallic phase, there is no orbital polarization, since in the presence of the spin-orbital coupling, the preserved spin rotational symmetry does not lift the orbital degeneracy or break the orbital symmetry. When   >  Uc3, the system enters the OSMP phase, as displayed in the left panel of Fig. 10. All of the three orbital occupations are nearly equal to 1. The magnetic moment per orbital steeply increases, and the total magnetic moment mtot is larger than 2μB. Meanwhile, the system undergoes an intermediate-spin (S=1) to high spin (S=3/2) transition with the increasing of U, and thus enters a high-spin state when   >  Uc3.

The right panel of Fig. 10 displays the renormalization factor of each orbital as a function of Coulomb interaction [formula], which is in sharp contrast with the [formula]=4.5 and 4 cases. In the PM and SAFM phases, all the renormalization factors Zxz, Zyz and Zxy (Zxz / yz  <  Zxy) smoothly decrease with increasing U, indicating the bandwidths become narrow due to the increase of the Coulomb correlation. When   >  Uc2, the system enters the Néel AFM state. In this situation Zxy gradually decreases, while Zxz and Zyz considerably change with U, suggesting that the variations of orbital and magnetic states mainly occur in these two orbitals. The lift of Zxz and Zyz implies the bandwidths of the two orbitals anomalously increase, which is attributed to the fact that the exchange splitting of spin-up and spin-down subbands of the xz- and yz-orbitals increases with the increase of U, leading to the total bandwidth broadening, which is also seen in Fig. 11 in what follows.

We present the PDOS of four typical phases, including PM, SAFM, Néel AFM metal and AFM OSMP, in Fig. 11 for Coulomb interaction [formula]=0, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 eV, respectively. It is found that in relatively small [formula] region, i.e.   ≤   Uc2, the [formula]/[formula] orbitals dominate the FS in both the PM and SAFM phases. Different from Fig. 11(a), in the SAFM phase with [formula]=0.75 eV in Fig. 11(b), the orbital degeneracy between [formula] and [formula] orbitals is lifted, consistent with the orbital polarization in the left panel of Fig. 10. Meanwhile in the Néel AFM metallic state with [formula]=1.0 eV in Fig. 11(c), the weight of the [formula] and [formula] orbitals in the FS is greatly suppressed; but the spin splitting becomes large, consistent with the intermediate spin configuration in Fig. 10. Interestingly, we find that when U  >    ≈  1.1 eV, an orbital-selective Mott transition occurs, i.e. an OSMP emerges. In this situation, only the broad [formula] orbital contributes to the FS, while the narrow [formula] and [formula] orbitals are insulating and sank below the FS, as seen the PDOS with U=1 eV in Fig. 11(d).

Therefore, at a half filling, the system is mainly a Néel AFM state without orbital ordering in the intermediate and strong correlations, in addition to an OSMP phase related with an intermediate-spin to high-spin transition. Compared with the other band fillings, the different magnetic phase diagrams suggest a band-filling controlling magnetism scenario in the iron selenide systems.

Discussion and Summary

The scenario of the orbital selective Mott transition in KxFe2 - ySe2 could be understood in a sketch of OSMP in the presence of magnetism shown in Fig. 12 through tuning the band filling and the correlation strength. When tuning to the half-filling, with the increase of Coulomb interaction and Hund's rule coupling, the spin-up and spin-down subbands split with each other, and the spin-up [formula]- and [formula]-orbitals are filled, sank below EF and become insulating; while the [formula]-orbital remains across EF and is conducting, giving rise to an AFM OSMP. We notice that in comparison with the bandwidths of KxFe2 - ySe2, the Uc3 for the occurrence of the OSMP is small. This may arise from the following two reasons: (1) in the parent phase of Fe-based superconductors, the Hund's rule coupling is large with JH=0.25[formula]. If small values JH=0.15[formula] or 0.1[formula] are adopted, Uc3 will reach a relatively large values up to 2 or even 3 eV; (2) Uc3 is obtained for the OSMP with AFM order in the present study, it will become larger in the PM situation. Since KFeSe2 possesses not only tetrahedra crystal field but also large magnetic moment, it may be a potential candidate for such an OSMP phase. We expect that further increasing the Coulomb interaction [formula] will drive the system to a magnetic insulating state accompanied with a metal-insulator transition.

We notice that different from our PM results, the first-principles electronic structure calculations suggested the ground state in KFe2Se2 is the SAFM ordering [\cite=CPL28-057402], or the bi-collinear AFM ordering resulting from the interplay among the nearest, the next-nearest, and the next-next-nearest-neighbor superexchange interactions mediated by Se 4[formula]-orbitals in AFe2Se2 (A=K, Tl, Rb, or Cs) [\cite=PRB84-054502]. In addition, some other iron-based materials, such as FeSe [\cite=PRL102-177003] [\cite=PRL102-177005], LiFeAs [\cite=nmat10-932], and KFe2As2 [\cite=PRL103-047002] [\cite=PRL106-067003] [\cite=nmat10-932], etc., have no magnetism at all as observed in the experiments, but AFM is obtained in the LDA calculations. The discrepancies among these materials suggest the magnetism is sensitive to the electronic properties or lattice distortion [\cite=nmat10-932]. The LDA methods usually so overestimate the magnetic moment and AFM ordering but omit some spin fluctuations of the system due to the intermediate electronic correlation that a proper treatment on the electronic correlation in these FeSe-based compounds may be important for understanding its magnetic ground state. In our study, we deal with the electronic correlation within the framework of the KRSB approach which is verified as an effective approach to treat the electronic correlation ranging from weak through intermediate to strong ones. Our PM groundstate result, not non-magnetic one, indicates that there exists strong spin fluctuation which is regarded as the superconducting pairing mechanism, thus KFe2Se2 is a potential candidate of the parent phase for superconductor without doping. Moreover, a recent STS experiment demonstrated the existence of phase separation and distinguished the contributions: the KFe2Se2 component contributes to superconductivity, while the K0.8Fe1.6Se2 Fe-vacancy ordering component to the insulating properties [\cite=nphys8-126], suggesting that pure KFe2Se2 is more possibly a PM phase when in the normal state. These observations are consistent with our present results.

In summary, starting with an effective three-orbital model for newly found KFe2Se2, we have shown that the ground state of KFe2Se2 at three-quarter filling is a paramagnetic metallic phase. We also suggest a possible OSMP phase through tuning the band-filling in KxFe2 - ySe2. Our results demonstrate that the band filling plays a key role in the electronic and magnetic properties of KxFe2 - ySe2. Since the phase separation widely exists in KxFe2 - ySe2 materials, future experiments are expected to confirm the magnetic ground state of KFe2Se2. In addition, the influences of the band filling and correlation on the electronic structures and magnetic properties in the presence of Fe vacancies for KxFe2 - ySe2 is an interesting topic, thus further theoretical works are expected.
