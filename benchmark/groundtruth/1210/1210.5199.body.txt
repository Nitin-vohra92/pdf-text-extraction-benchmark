Measurements of Non-photonic Electron Production and Azimuthal Anisotropy in [formula], 62.4 and 200 GeV Au+Au Collisions from STAR at RHIC

Introduction

Exploiting the merits of heavy quarks is one of the most important and promising tools to probe the strongly interacting partonic medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks are mostly created through gluon fusion [\cite=cacciari], almost exclusively [\cite=levai] early in the heavy-ion collision, therefore, they experience all stages of the medium evolution. Also, their masses are external to QCD [\cite=muller] and thus are not modified by the presence of the medium. Hence, the kinematics of emerging heavy quarks carry a memory of their interactions with the medium. By comparing the heavy quark production in heavy-ion collisions to the baseline production in p + p and d+Au collisions, we seek to further understand the flavor dependence of energy loss in the medium. Azimuthal anistropy of heavy quarks provides further information on the strength of their interaction with the medium, and better discrimination between theoretical models.

In this article we report on the preliminary results of measuring the production of electrons from heavy flavor semi-leptonic decays, so-called non-photonic electrons (NPE). We show a new high precision measurement of NPE production at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at [formula] GeV, then using our previously published p + p measurement [\cite=starpp200] we show an improved nuclear modification factor RAA and compare it to theoretical models. Then we show measurements of NPE azimuthal anistropy, v2{2}, v2{4} and v2{EP}. Finally, we show measurements of NPE production in Au+Au collisions at [formula] GeV, and v2{2} measurements at [formula] and 62.4 GeV.

Datasets and Analyses

In RHIC run 2010, STAR has sampled nearly 2.6 nb- 1 luminosity of Au+Au collisions at [formula] GeV. Minimum Bias (MB) trigger data is used for low pT  electrons, while high pT trigger (HT) data provides higher statistical precision for pT  >   2 GeV/c. We have also utilized data from an independent 0 - 5% centrality trigger. We use about 1 nb- 1 for the [formula] GeV results we show here. During the same RHIC run STAR has also collected Au+Au collision data at [formula] and 62.4 GeV, which allows us to search for the onset of heavy quark suppression and flow.

For analyses in all collision energies, the most important detector is the STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with large acceptance, which provides tracking and dE / dx for electrons identification. Hadron rejection is done utilizing Time of Flight (TOF) [\cite=tof] information at low pT and the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) [\cite=bemc] at high pT. The BEMC is also used for triggering on high pT electrons.

To extract NPE, we statistically subtract the contribution of photonic electrons (PE) from the identified inclusive electrons. By reconstructing the invariant mass of electron pairs we estimate the PE contribution from gamma conversion, and π0, η Dalitz decays. Extracted yield of PE is then corrected by a pT dependent reconstruction efficiency determined from simulation to be at the level of 30-60%. Other non-photonic background sources are electrons from vector mesons di-electron decays (pT  <   3 GeV/c), and electrons from heavy quarkonia and Drell-Yan decays (pT  >   2.0 GeV/c). Contribution from J / ψ can be non-negligible in this region, estimates based on measured J / ψ experimental measurements show it can be as large as 20% of the measured non-photonic electrons. This contribution has been subtracted from [formula] GeV invariant yields we report in this article.

Results

Figure [\ref=fig:npe200gev] left shows the new measurement of NPE mid-rapidity differential invariant yield for pT  = 1.5 - 10 GeV/c. The novelty of this measurement lies in the achieved high statistical precision. The large amount of statistics allows differentiating the measurements in five centrality bins, in addition to a 0 - 5% centrality bin from a central trigger. With such a precision and guided by the scaled FONLL upper bound, one can qualitatively notice the suppression of the yield in Au+Au collisions compared to p + p collisions despite the large log-scale spanned in the figure.

Figure [\ref=fig:npe200gev] upper-right panel shows NPE RAA using 0 - 10% centrality spectra and STAR published p + p [\cite=starpp200] results compared to a collection of models of different energy loss mechanisms. As we see in the Figure, despite the success of describing the suppression of light hadrons [\cite=dglv], gluon radiation alone fails to explain the observed large NPE suppression at high pT. The large uncertainty from our baseline p+p measurement dominates the current overall uncertainty. Analysis of the large amount of collected high quality data from RHIC runs 2009 and 2012 are needed to improve the baseline precision. However, to exploit the high precision of this measurement, it will be interesting to see theoretical predictions for the quenched invariant yields rather than the RAA only. With the current precision the predictions from all other energy energy loss models describe the data.

Figure [\ref=fig:npe200gev] lower-right shows NPE v2 measurements from 2- and 4- particle correlations and event plane method, represented as v2{2}, v2{4} and v2{EP} in Au+Au collisions at [formula] GeV. The v2{2} and v2{EP} are consistent with each other for pT  >   3 GeV/c. While both show a pronounced systematic increase in v2 towards high pT, at this point we cannot distinguish whether this rise is due to jet-like correlations unrelated to the reaction plane or due to the path length dependence of partonic energy loss. For pT <  3 GeV/c we show both v2{2} and v2{4}. In v2{4} the non-flow contribution is negligible and the flow fluctuations contribution is negative, hence providing a lower bound on the v2 of NPE. Both v2 measurements are finite, which indicates a strong charm-medium interaction at [formula] GeV.

To provide more experimental discrimination power for theoretical models STAR is extending its NPE program to lower energies. The quest is to see if the energy loss of heavy quarks is lessened or turned off at lower energies. Figure [\ref=fig:spec62] shows NPE invariant yield in Au+Au collisions at [formula] GeV together with a scaled FONLL prediction. While a previous p+p measurement at the ISR [\cite=isr] seems to agree with FONLL upper-band, our measurement is systematically higher than both. Measurement of v2{2} at lower energies shown in Figure [\ref=fig:v2_low_energy] seem to be consistent within errors with that at [formula] GeV for pT  >  1.0 GeV/c. The results for data points at pT < 1.0 GeV/c seem to hint at a milder charm-medium interaction compared to those at [formula] GeV.

Summary

In this article we reported on STAR new preliminary results of non-photonic electron measurements. The new NPE measurements in [formula] GeV collisions are precise in a broad pT region. NPE nuclear modification factor measurement show a large suppression of NPE production in central Au+Au collisions. We observe large NPE v2 at low pT which indicate a strong charm-medium interaction. The v2 increases towards higher pT (> 3 GeV/c) is possibly due to jet-correlations unrelated to the reaction plane and/or due to path-length dependence of heavy quark energy loss.

At lower energies we reported on measurement of NPE invariant yield in Au+Au collisions at [formula] GeV which is systematically higher than a FONLL prediction. We have also presented our results of azimuthal anistropy at [formula] and 62.4 GeV by measuring v2{2} which for pT < 1.0 GeV/c seem to hint at a milder charm-medium interaction than at [formula] GeV.
