Weighted norm estimates for the Semyanistyi fractional integrals and Radon transforms

Introduction

The Radon transforms play the central role in integral geometry and have numerous applications [\cite=Dea] [\cite=He] [\cite=Mar] [\cite=Na]. In 1960 V.I. Semyanistyi [\cite=Se1] came up with an idea to regard the Radon transform on [formula] as a member of suitable analytic family of fractional integrals [formula], so that for sufficiently good f,

[formula]

This idea paves the way to a variety of inversion formulas for the Radon transform and has proved to be useful in subsequent developments; see, e.g., [\cite=OR] and references therein.

We recall basic definitions. Let Πn be the set of all hyperplanes in [formula]. The Radon transform takes a function f(x) on [formula] to a function [formula] on Πn. The corresponding Semyanistyi's fractional integrals are defined by

[formula]

[formula]

where dist(x,τ) is the Euclidean distance between the point x and the hyperplane τ. The normalizing coefficient in ([\ref=tong2]) is inherited from one-dimensional Riesz potentials [\cite=La] [\cite=Ru96]. More general integrals, when τ is a plane of arbitrary dimension 1   ≤   k   ≤   n   -   1, were introduced in [\cite=Ru04b].

Mapping properties of Radon transforms were studied in numerous publications from different points of view; see, e.g., [\cite=Cal] [\cite=Chr84] [\cite=Dr87] [\cite=DNO] [\cite=F] [\cite=KR10] [\cite=LT] [\cite=Na] [\cite=OS] [\cite=Q] [\cite=So] [\cite=Str], to mention a few. In Section 2 we suggest an alternative approach which works well in weighted Lp spaces with a radial power weight, yields sharp estimates and explicit formulas for the operator norms, and extends to fractional integrals ([\ref=tong2]). Similar results are obtained in Section 3 for more general operators associated to the k-plane transform for any 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. Main results of the paper are presented by Theorems [\ref=o9iu], [\ref=o9iur], [\ref=o9iuk], and [\ref=o9iurk].

Our approach was inspired by a series of works on operators with homogeneous kernels; see, e.g., [\cite=Kar] [\cite=Sa] [\cite=Str69] [\cite=Wa]. A common point for this class of operators and the afore-mentioned operators of integral geometry is a nice behavior with respect to rotations and dilations. The same approach is applicable to the dual Radon transforms and the corresponding dual Semyanistyi integrals; see, e.g., [\cite=Ru12], where a different technique has been used.

Fractional integrals associated to the Radon transform

Preliminaries

In the following   σn - 1  =  2πn / 2  /  Γ(n / 2) is the area of the unit sphere Sn - 1 in [formula] dσ(η) stands for the surface element of Sn - 1; [formula] are coordinate unit vectors; O(n) is the group of orthogonal transformations of [formula] endowed with the invariant probability measure. The Lp spaces, 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , are defined in a usual way, 1 / p + 1 / p' = 1. We recall that Πn denotes the set of all hyperplanes τ in [formula]. Every τ∈Πn can be parametrized as

[formula]

Clearly,

[formula]

We set

[formula]

[formula]

where μ and ν are real numbers. Passing to polar coordinates, we have

[formula]

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

[formula]

We write the Radon transform in terms of the parametrization ([\ref=hppl]) as

[formula]

where [formula], dθu denotes the Lebesgue measure on [formula]. Similarly,

[formula]

Let 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , 1 / p + 1 / p' = 1, α > 0. Suppose

[formula]

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

The necessity of ([\ref=op98]) can be proved using the standard scaling argument; cf. [\cite=St]. Let [formula], λ > 0. Then

[formula]

Hence, whenever [formula] with c independent of f, we get ν  =  μ  -  α - (n - 1) / p'. As we shall see below, the condition ([\ref=op981]) is also best possible.

Proof of Theorem [\ref=o9iu]

[formula]

Step 1

Let us prove ([\ref=op982]). For t > 0, changing variables θ  =  γe1, γ∈O(n), and x = tγy, we get

[formula]

If 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , then, by Minkowski's inequality, using ([\ref=zzxs]) and ([\ref=00ol]), we obtain that the norm [formula] does not exceed the following:

[formula]

If p =   ∞  , then ([\ref=zzxsb]) and ([\ref=00olb]) give a similar estimate [formula] in which [formula] has the same form with 1 / p = n / p = 0.

To evaluate [formula], denoting λ  =  μ + n / p, we have

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

see, e.g., [\cite=La], where convolutions of Riesz kernels are considered in any dimensions. Combining these formulas with ([\ref=tong22]), we obtain the desired expression. We observe that the integral in ([\ref=ppza]) is finite if and only if α - 1 + n / p' < μ < n / p', which is ([\ref=op981]).

Step 2

Let us show that [formula]. By Step 1, [formula]. Thus, it remains to prove that [formula]. Since the operator [formula] is bounded, then for any [formula] and [formula] by Hölder's inequality we have

[formula]

Suppose [formula] and [formula]. Then

[formula]

Let 1 < p <   ∞  . Then

[formula]

Choose φ0(t) = tμp  -  αfp - 10(t) so that ||φ||~p',  -  ν = 21 / p'||f||p - 1p,μ. Then ([\ref=lloi]) yields

[formula]

Finally we set f0(t) = 0 if t < 1 and f0(t) = t-  μ - n / p  -  ε, ε > 0, if t > 1. Then ||f||pp,μ  =  σn - 1  /  εp and ([\ref=lloiz]) becomes

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=ppza]). Passing to the limit as ε  →  0, we obtain [formula].

If p = 1, then ν  =  μ  -  α. We choose φ0(t) = tμ  -  α and proceed as above. If p =   ∞  , we choose f0(r) = r-  μ. Then ||f||∞  ,μ = 1,

[formula]

and [formula]. We set φ0(t) = 0 if t < 1 and φ0(t) = t-  δ if t > 1, where δ is big enough. This gives

[formula]

or [formula], as desired. [formula]

The case α = 0

This case corresponds to the Radon transform ([\ref=rtra1]) and requires independent consideration.

Let 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , 1 / p + 1 / p' = 1,

[formula]

Then ||Rf||~p,ν  ≤  c  ||f||p,μ, where

[formula]

The necessity of ([\ref=op98r]) can be checked as in Theorem [\ref=o9iu]. To prove the norm inequality, setting θ  =  γe1, γ∈O(n), t > 0, we have

[formula]

Hence,

[formula]

where

[formula]

The last integral gives an expression in ([\ref=op983r]). The proof of the equality c = ||R|| mimics that in Section [\ref=00aq].

Fractional integrals associated to the k-plane transforms

We denote by Πn,k the set of all nonoriented k-dimensional planes in [formula], 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1. To parameterize such planes and define the corresponding analogues of R and [formula], we introduce the Stiefel manifold Vn,n - k  ~  O(n) / O(k) of n  ×  (n - k) real matrices, the columns of which are mutually orthogonal unit n-vectors. For v∈Vn,n - k, dv stands for the left O(n)-invariant probability measure on Vn,n - k which is also right O(n - k)-invariant. Every plane τ∈Πn,k can be parameterized by

[formula]

where vT stands for the transpose of the matrix v. The case k = n - 1 agrees with ([\ref=hppl]). Clearly,

[formula]

This equality is a substitute for ([\ref=00ma]) for all 1  ≤  k  ≤  n - 1.

The k-plane transform takes a function f on [formula] to a function [formula] on Πn,k. In terms of the parametrization ([\ref=hpplk]) it has the form

[formula]

where [formula] denotes the k-dimensional linear subspace orthogonal to v and dvu stands the usual Lebesgue measure on [formula]. Similarly,

[formula]

where |vTx - t| denotes for the Euclidean norm of vTx - t in [formula],

[formula]

Here 1 / γn - k(α) is the same normalizing coefficient as in the Riesz potential on [formula] [\cite=La] [\cite=Ru96].

One can regard Πn,k as a fiber bundle over the Grassmann manifold of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of [formula]. The corresponding parametrization of k-planes is different from ([\ref=hpplk]); cf. [\cite=Ru04b] [\cite=Ru12]. In the present article we prefer to work with parametrization ([\ref=hpplk]) because it reduces to ([\ref=hppl]) when k = n - 1.

Let

[formula]

where the Lp norm on [formula] is taken with respect to the measure dvdt;

[formula]

In - k is the identity (n - k)  ×  (n - k) matrix. Then

[formula]

if 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , and

[formula]

Let 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , 1 / p + 1 / p' = 1, α > 0. Suppose

[formula]

[formula]

Then [formula] where

[formula]

Proof of Theorem [\ref=o9iuk]

[formula]

Step 1

The necessity of ([\ref=op98k]) is a consequence of the equalities

[formula]

where [formula], λ > 0. Let γ∈O(n) and ω∈O(n - k) be such that v = γv0, t = |t|ωe1. Changing variables in ([\ref=tongk]) by setting

[formula]

we obtain

[formula]

Suppose first 1  ≤  p <   ∞  . Then, by Minkowski's inequality, owing to ([\ref=zzxsk]) and ([\ref=op98k]), the norm [formula] does not exceed the following:

[formula]

[formula]

If p =   ∞   we similarly have [formula], where cα,k has the same form as above with 1 / p = n / p = 0.

To compute cα,k, we set λ  =  μ + n / p. Then

[formula]

where

[formula]

[formula]

see also ([\ref=012a]). It remains to put these formulas together and make obvious simplifications. Note that the repeated integral in the expression for cα,k is finite if and only if α + k - n / p < μ < n / p', which is ([\ref=op981k]). Thus [formula].

Step 2

To prove that [formula] we follow the reasoning from Section [\ref=00aq]. For any [formula] and [formula],

[formula]

Let [formula], [formula]. Then

[formula]

Suppose 1 < p <   ∞  . Then ||f||p,μ can be computed by ([\ref=844f]) and

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=zzxsk]). Choose φ0(r) = rμp  -  αfp - 10(r). Then

[formula]

and we have

[formula]

Setting f0(r) = 0 if r < 1 and f0(r) = r-  μ - n / p  -  ε, ε > 0, if r > 1, we obtain ||f||pp,μ  =  σn - 1  /  εp, and therefore,

[formula]

cf. ([\ref=654d]) Passing to the limit as ε  →  0, we obtain [formula]. The cases p = 1 and p =   ∞   are treated as in Section [\ref=00aq].

Weighted norm estimates for the k-plane transform

The following statement deals with the k-plane transform ([\ref=rtra1k]) and formally corresponds to α = 0 in Theorem [\ref=o9iuk].

Let 1  ≤  p  ≤    ∞  , 1 / p + 1 / p' = 1. Suppose that

[formula]

Then ||Rkf||~p,ν  ≤  ck  ||f||p,μ, where

[formula]

As before, the conditions ([\ref=op98rk]) are sharp. To prove the norm inequality, as in Section [\ref=00aqn] we set v = γv0, t = rωe1, γ∈O(n), ω∈O(n - k), r > 0. This gives

[formula]

If 1  ≤  p <   ∞  , then combining ([\ref=zzxsk]) with Minkowski's inequality, we majorize ||Rkf||~p,ν by the following:

[formula]

[formula]

The last integral was computed in the previous section. In the case p =   ∞   we similarly have ||Rkf||~∞  ,ν  ≤  ck  ||f||∞  ,μ with 1 / p = n / p = 0. The proof of the equality ck = ||Rk|| mimics that in Theorem [\ref=o9iu].
