Stirring faces: mixing in a quiescent fluid

Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA

This video depicts the fluid mixing that occurs as a two-dimensional flat plate plunges sinusoidally in a quiescent fluid. The flow is simulated using the immersed boundary projection method of [\cite=taira:07ibfs] [\cite=taira:fastIBPM]. Length is nondimensionalized by the chord length, and velocity is nondimensionalized so that a unit free-stream velocity would correspond to a Reynolds number of [formula]. The plunging motion is sinusoidal with prescribed vertical motion: y(t)  =  A sin (2Ï€ft), with A = 0.5 and f = 0.5 in dimensionless units.

Separated flow structures are visualized by plotting fields of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) [\citep=ftle_02:Ha] [\citep=shadden:07] [\citep=brunton:fFTLE]. These structures represent material lines that either attract or repel particles in forward time. The duration of the particle integration used to compute these FTLE fields is T = 4 (dimensionless time).

As the unsteady flow develops, strange faces begin to appear in the FTLE field. Although this is an illusion, brought about by symmetry in the vortex cores, the variety of expressions is striking.
