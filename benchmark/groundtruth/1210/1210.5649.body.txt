Edge-Distance-Regular Graphs Are Distance-Regular

Introduction

In this paper, we use standard concepts and results about distance-regular graphs (see, for example, Biggs [\cite=b93], or Brouwer, Cohen, and Neumaier [\cite=bcn89]), spectral graph theory (see Cvetkovi, Doob, and Sachs [\cite=cds80], or Godsil [\cite=g93]), and spectral and algebraic characterizations of distance-regular graphs (see, for instance, Fiol [\cite=f02]).

Edge-distance-regular graphs, introduced by Fiol and Garriga [\cite=fg01], are analogous to distance-regular graphs but considering the distance partitions induced by every edge instead of each vertex. Thus, many known results for distance-regular graphs have their counterpart for edge-distance-regular graphs such as, for instance, the so-called spectral excess theorem. This theorem characterizes (vertex- or edge-)distance-regular graphs by their spectra and the (average) number of vertices at extremal distance (from every vertex or edge). See Fiol and Garriga [\cite=fg97] and Cámara, Dalfó, Fàbrega, Fiol, and Garriga [\cite=cdffg11] for the cases of distance-regular and edge-distance-regular graphs, respectively. Also, for short proofs, see Van Dam [\cite=vd08] and Fiol, Gago, and Garriga [\cite=fgg09].

A distance-regular graph Γ with diameter d and odd-girth (that is, the shortest cycle of odd length) 2d + 1 is called a generalized odd graph, also known as an almost-bipartite distance-regular graph or a regular thin near (2d + 1)-gon. The first name is due to the fact that odd graphs Ok (see Biggs [\cite=b93]) are distance-regular and have such an odd-girth. Notice that, in this case, the intersection parameters of Γ satisfy [formula] and ad  ≠  0. Recently, Van Dam and Haemers [\cite=vdh10] showed that any connected regular graph with d + 1 distinct eigenvalues and odd-girth 2d + 1 is a generalized odd graph. Moreover, Lee and Weng [\cite=lw11] used a variation of the spectral excess theorem for nonregular graphs to show that, in fact, the regularity condition is not necessary, and Van Dam and Fiol [\cite=vdf12] gave a more direct short proof of the same result.

Here, we provide some (combinatorial and algebraic) proofs that, in fact, any edge-distance-regular graph Γ is also distance-regular. Moreover, if this is the case, Γ is either bipartite or a generalized odd graph, and the relationship between the intersection numbers of the corresponding distance partitions, induced by a vertex and by an edge, is made explicit. Thus, a distance-regular graph Γ is edge-distance-regular if and only if Γ is either bipartite or a generalized odd graph. In fact, the 'only if' part is also a consequence of a result by Martin [\cite=m92], who proved that if a pair of vertices at distance h is a completely regular code in a distance-regular graph Γ with diameter d, then either h = 1 and Γ has intersection numbers [formula], or h = d and Γ is antipodal.

In the rest of this section, we recall some concepts, terminology, and results involved. Throughout this paper, Γ = (V,E) denotes a connected graph on n = |V| vertices and m = |E| edges, having adjacency matrix [formula], and spectrum [formula], where [formula], and the superscripts mi stand for the multiplicities. The distance between two vertices u,v is denoted by [formula], so that the diameter of Γ is [formula]. Moreover, given C  ⊂  V, the set [formula] is called the i-th subconstituent with respect to C, where [formula] and C0 = C. In particular, when C is a singleton, C = {u}, we write Γi(u) for Γi({u}) and set Γ(u) for Γ1(u). The eccentricity or covering radius of C is [formula], so that we have the partition [formula].

Given any two vertices w,u at distance [formula] of a graph Γ, we consider the numbers of neighbors of w at distance i - 1, i, i + 1 from u, that is,

[formula]

and Γ is distance-regular if these numbers only depend on i. In this case we write ci(w,u) = ci, ai(w,u) = ai and bi(w,u) = bi and say that these numbers are well defined. A useful characterization of distance-regularity is the existence of the so-called distance-polynomials [formula] of Γ satisfying

[formula]

where i is the i-th distance matrix of Γ, with entries (i)uv = 1 if [formula], and (i)uv = 0 otherwise. Recall also that, if Γ is distance-regular, the intersection parameters [formula], with [formula], for [formula], are the Fourier coefficients of the polynomial pipj in terms of the basis constituted by the distance-polynomials of Γ with respect to the scalar product

[formula]

Thus, with [formula], we have the well-known relations

[formula]

In particular, when k = 1 and i = j, we have n1  =  λ0  =  δ (the degree of Γ) and pii1 = ai. Thus, δp1ii = niai and, hence, p1ii = 0 if and only if ai = 0. In fact notice that, for a general graph, the condition [formula] for any two adjacent vertices u,v is equivalent to say that ai is well defined and null.

In an edge-distance-regular graph Γ = (V,E) with diameter d, every pair of adjacent vertices u,v∈V is a completely regular code. More precisely, the distance partition [formula] of V induced by an edge uv∈E, where ṽi  =  ṽi(uv) = Γi(uv) is the set of vertices at distance i from {u,v} and d̃∈{d - 1,d}, is regular and with the same edge-intersection numbers for any edge. That is, the numbers

[formula]

do not depend neither on the edge uv nor on the vertex w∈ṽi, but only on the distance i, in which case we write them as ãi,i,i for [formula] and say that they are well defined (see Cámara, Dalfó, Fàbrega, Fiol and Garriga [\cite=cdffg11] for more details).

The characterization

In the next result we show that every edge-distance-regular graph is either bipartite distance-regular or a generalized odd graph.

Proof. As the complete graphs clearly satisfy the result, we can assume that d > 1. Given two adjacent vertices u and v of Γ, let us consider the intersection numbers [formula], so that the vertex partition induced by the distances from u and v is shown in Fig. [\ref=edge-diagram], where [formula]. (Notice that [formula] when |i - j| > 1, as [formula].) Let [formula] be the distance partition induced by the edge uv, and define ãi(uv), i(uv) and i(uv) as above. Clearly, ã0(uv) = ã0 = c1 = 1.

We have the following facts:

For [formula], all vertices adjacent to w∈Vi,i - 1  ⊂  ṽi - 1 and at distance i + 1 from u are in Vi + 1,i  ⊂  ṽi. Hence,

[formula]

For [formula], all vertices adjacent to w∈Vi,i + 1  ⊂  ṽi and at distance i - 1 from u are in Vi - 1,i  ⊂  ṽi - 1. Thus,

[formula]

Moreover, assuming that ai is well defined with value ai = 0, the vertices adjacent to vertex w but at distance i from v are in [formula] since [formula], whereas [formula] since w∈Vi,i + 1  ⊂  Γi(u). Consequently,

[formula]

For [formula], all vertices adjacent to w∈Vi,i  ⊂  ṽi and at distance i - 1 from u are either in Vi - 1,i or Vi - 1,i - 1. Thus,

[formula]

and, analogously,

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

(b)  ⇒  (a): Assume that Γ is distance-regular with intersection parameters ai,bi,ci, for [formula] (the parameters bi and ci are indicated in Fig. [\ref=edge-diagram]). If Γ is either bipartite or a generalized odd graph, then ai = 0 and [formula] for every [formula] (in particular, as ad - 1 = 0, the parameters ad and cd are those indicated in the same figure for the nonbipartite case; otherwise, we also have [formula] and, hence, ad = cd = 0). Thus, from the above reasonings we obtain:

By Eq. ([\ref=desig1]) and for every vertex w∈ṽi - 1, we have

[formula]

Hence, i is well defined for [formula]. Moreover, if Γ is a generalized odd graph, d - 1 = ad.

By Eq. ([\ref=desig3]) and for every vertex w∈ṽi,

[formula]

Consequently, i is well defined for [formula].

Moreover, if Γ is a generalized odd graph, [formula], and Eq. ([\ref=desig5]) yields that, for every vertex w∈ṽd,d,

[formula]

Summarizing, all intersection numbers i, [formula], and i, [formula] are well defined, and Γ is edge-distance-regular. (Of course, the other intersection numbers are just ãi  =  δ  -  i  -  i, for [formula].)

(a)  ⇒  (b): Assume that Γ is edge-distance-regular with edge-intersection numbers ãi,i,i, for [formula]. Then, to show that the numbers ci(w,u), ai(w,u) and bi(w,u) depend only on the distance [formula], we proceed by induction on i. To begin with, observe that b0, a0, and c1 are well defined, with values b0 = b0(u,u) = 0  +  ã0  =  0 + 1, a0 = a0(u,u) = 0, and c1 = c1(w,u) = 1.

Now, assume that, for some i  ≤  d - 1, ci and ai - 1 are well defined with ai - 1 = 0 or, equivalently, [formula]. Thus, in order to show that ci + 1 and ai exist, consider a shortest path [formula] of length i + 1(  ≤  d), so that w∈Vi,i + 1(u,v). Then, Eq. ([\ref=desig3]) gives

[formula]

Now, suppose that u'v' is an arbitrary edge. If we assume that [formula], there exists a vertex w'∈Vi,i(u',v') and Eq. ([\ref=desig5]) gives

[formula]

which would be a contradiction. Thus [formula] and ai exists, being ai = 0. Moreover, coming back to the edge uv, Eqs. ([\ref=desig3]) and ([\ref=desig3b]) yield

[formula]

and, since w and v are arbitrary vertices at distance i + 1, ci + 1 is well defined.

Thus, the numbers bi = b0 - ci - ai, for [formula], are also well defined; and the same holds for ad = b0 - cd when Γ is nonbipartite. Consequently, Γ is as claimed.   [formula]

Homogeneous graphs

As a consequence of the previous results, we next prove that the edge-distance-regular graphs are, in fact, a particular case of the so-called (1-)homogeneous graphs introduced by Nomura in [\cite=n94]. A graph Γ is called homogeneous if for all nonnegative integers r,s,i,j and pairs of edges uv, u'v',

[formula]

where Vs,r(u,v) is defined as before. In other words, Γ is homogeneous if the partition of Fig. [\ref=edge-diagram] is a regular (or equitable) partition with the same intersection numbers for every pair of adjacent vertices u,v. For a detailed study of regular partitions, see Godsil [\cite=g93] and Godsil and McKay [\cite=gmk80].

In [\cite=cn05], Curtin and Nomura showed that every bipartite or almost bipartite distance-regular graph is homogeneous. Then, from Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr] we have:

However, the converse is not true. A counterexample is, for instance, the Wells graph W, which is the unique distance-regular graph on n = 32 vertices and intersection array ι(W) = {5,4,1,1;1,1,4,5} (see Brouwer, Cohen and Neumaier [\cite=bcn89]). Thus, since a2 = 3 and ai = 0 for every i  ≠  2, W is homogeneous (see Nomura [\cite=n94]) but not edge-distance-regular. The intersection diagrams induced by a vertex and two adjacent vertices, showing that W is homogeneous, are illustrated in Fig.[\ref=wells].

An algebraic approach

The matrix approach to the result of Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr] is based on the relationship of orthogonal polynomials with (edge-)distance-regularity of graphs. Recall that every system of orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable {ri}0  ≤  i  ≤  d satisfies a three term recurrence of the form

[formula]

where the terms b- 1 and cd + 1 are zero.

In [\cite=fgy96b] Fiol, Garriga and Yebra gave the following characterization of distance-regularity.

Moreover, such a polynomial is the highest degree member of the predistance polynomials {pi}0  ≤  i  ≤  d of Γ--which are orthogonal with respect to the scalar product [formula], and are normalized in such a way that [formula]. When the graph is distance-regular, these polynomials satisfy a three term recurrence as in Eq. ([\ref=eqn_three_term_rec]) with {γi,αi,βi}  =  {ci,ai,bi}.

The first ingredient for the algebraic approach to our results is the following proposition from Cámara, Dalfó, Fàbrega, Fiol, and Garriga [\cite=cdffg11], which describes the different possibilities for the edge-diameter and the local spectra of edges in an edge-distance-regular graph. In a regular graph, the e-local spectrum of an edge e = uv is constituted by those eigenvalues λi∈ such that the orthogonal projection of the characteristic vector of {u,v} on their corresponding λi-eigenspace is not null; see [\cite=cdffg11] for more details. The set of these e-local eigenvalues is denoted by [formula].

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then, by using this notation, Proposition [\ref=prop_e-d-r_propietats] establishes that, if Γ is edge-distance-regular and nonbipartite, then   =    =   for every edge e∈E, and [formula] otherwise. In both cases all edges have the same local spectrum (Γ is said to be edge-spectrum regular), with d̃ + 1 = || distinct e-local eigenvalues.

The role of the distance matrices in the study of edge distance-regularity is played by the distance incidence matrices. More precisely, for a given graph Γ = (V,E), let [formula] be its edge-diameter. Then, for every [formula], the i-incidence matrix of Γ is the (|V|  ×  |E|)-matrix i = (bue) with entries bue = 1 if [formula], and bue = 0 otherwise. The following result corresponds to Theorems 4.4 and 4.9 of [\cite=cdffg11].

Moreover, if this is the case, these polynomials are the edge-predistance-polynomials, {p̃i}0  ≤  i  ≤  d̃, with d̃  =  D̃, satisfying a three term recurrence as in Eq. ([\ref=eqn_three_term_rec]) with {γi,αi,βi}  =  {i,ãi,i}. Here we use the following consequence, which can be seen as the analogue of Theorem [\ref=teo_caract_d-r] for edge-distance-regularity.

Proof. We only need to prove sufficiency, which is straightforward if we multiply both sides of Eq. ([\ref=edge-pd(A)=Ad]) by the all-1 vector [formula] and apply Theorem [\ref=teo_caract_e-d-r](b).   [formula]

A matrix approach to Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr]

Now, we can rewrite Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr] and prove it by showing that the distance polynomials exist if and only if the edge-distance-polynomials do.

Proof. (a)  ⇒  (b): Since ai = 0 we have that

[formula]

Moreover, when Γ is nonbipartite, ad  ≠  0 and

[formula]

Then, multiplying both sides of Eq. ([\ref=pd(A)=Ad]) by 0 (on the right) and using all the above equations, we get

[formula]

Thus, using Eq. ([\ref=pi(A)=Ai]), we get that p̃d()0  =  d with

[formula]

as claimed in Eq. ([\ref=p-tilde-d-vs-p's]), and Γ is edge-distance-regular by Corollary [\ref=coro-edr].

Similarly, by using again Eq. ([\ref=AiB0]), we get

[formula]

so that

[formula]

as claimed in Eq. ([\ref=p-tilde-i-vs-p's]). Moreover, if Γ is bipartite, then ad = 0, d̃ = d - 1, and the existence of the edge-distance-polynomial p̃d - 1 imply that Γ is edge-distance-regular, again by Corollary [\ref=coro-edr].

Eqs. ([\ref=p-i-vs-p-tildes's]) and ([\ref=p-d-vs-p-tildes's]) are immediate consequences from Eqs. ([\ref=p-tilde-i-vs-p's]) and ([\ref=p-tilde-d-vs-p's]). Finally, when Γ is bipartite, we can obtain pd by adding all the equalities in Eq. ([\ref=p-i-vs-p-tildes's]) to get [formula], so that pd = H - qd - 1, where H is the Hoffman polynomial (see Hoffman [\cite=hof63]), and we have Eq. ([\ref=bip-p-d-vs-p-tildes's]).

(b)  ⇒  (a): Note first that [formula], where δ is the degree of Γ. Now, we show that all distance-polynomials exist, in particular pd() = d, and apply Theorem [\ref=teo_caract_d-r].

Suppose that Γ is nonbipartite. By Proposition [\ref=prop_e-d-r_propietats] we know that   =   and, consequently, d̃ = d. As in Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr], the proof is by induction on i. First, a1 = 0 (as d > 1), c1 = 1, and the first two distance polynomials exist p0 = 1 and p1 = x. Now, assume that, for some i < d - 1, ai = 0, ci is well defined, and there exist the polynomials pi - 1 and pi.

To compute the product [formula], let us consider two vertices u,w at distance [formula] and take [formula]. Then, [formula]. Each term of the sum equals 1 for every vertex w'∈Γ(w) such that the edge e = ww' is at distance i from u (since [formula]); that is, for every vertex

[formula]

where we used that, since ai = 0, [formula] (notice that if w'∈Vi,i - 1(u,v), then we would have ai(w,u)  ≠  0) and [formula]. Hence, [formula]. Reasoning similarly, for a vertex w such that [formula], and [formula] (that is, w∈Vi + 1,i(u,v)  ⊂  ), we have [formula]. Otherwise, if [formula], then [formula]. Consequently,

[formula]

and, multiplying Eq. ([\ref=tilde-pi(A)]) by [formula] on the right, we get

[formula]

Thus, the distance polynomial of degree i + 1 is

[formula]

graph Γ is (i + 1)-partially distance-regular (that is, pj() = j for [formula]), and ci + 1 is well defined; see Dalfó, Van Dam, Fiol, Garriga, and Gorissen [\cite=ddfgg11]. (Notice that this could also be derived from Eqs. ([\ref=desig3]) and ([\ref=desig3b]) yielding [formula], as in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr].) Now, let u,v be two arbitrary adjacent vertices. If [formula], Eq. ([\ref=desig5]) yields [formula]. It follows that if a vertex is at distance at most i + 1 from an end of an edge, it is at distance at most i from the other end. Thus, the diameter of Γ is i + 1 < d, which is a contradiction. Hence, [formula] and, since u,v are generic vertices, ai + 1 = 0 is well defined.

The induction above proves that there exist all the distance-polynomials [formula] and, also, we have [formula]. Then, Γ is distance-regular with [formula].

Suppose now that Γ is bipartite. Then d̃ = d - 1 and [formula]. Now, reasoning similarly as above from a shortest path [formula] of length d, we have

[formula]

Thus,

[formula]

Now, the key point is that the distance matrix i of a bipartite graph can be thought as a 2  ×  2 block matrix such that when i is odd (respectively, even) the diagonal (respectively, off-diagonal) entries are the zero matrices. Indeed, the same happens with the powers of the adjacency matrix, [formula]. Assume that d is odd (respectively, even), the odd part (respectively, even part) of xp̃d - 1  +  δp̃d - 1 is a polynomial p satisfying p() = δd (the other part gives d - 2d - 1). Hence, from Theorem [\ref=teo_caract_d-r], Γ is distance-regular, with highest degree distance polynomial [formula].   [formula]

To illustrate the above result, let us give two examples: one for the bipartite case and the other for the nonbipartite one. With respect to the former, consider the cube Q3, which satisfies the conditions of the theorem and has the following parameters:

ι(Q3) = {3,2,1;1,2,3},  p0 = 1,  p1 = x,  [formula],  [formula];

(Q3) = {2,1;1,2},   p̃0 = 1,  p̃1 = x - 1,  [formula].

Then, as d = δ = 3 and 1 = 1, we have

[formula]

as it should be.

Now, for the nonbipartite case we consider the odd graph O4, which also satisfies the conditions of the theorem, and has parameters:

ι(O4) = {4,3,3;1,1,2},  p0 = 1,  p1 = x,  p2 = x2 - 4,  [formula];

(O4) = {3,3,2;1,1,4},  p̃0 = 1,  p̃1 = x - 1,  p̃2 = x3 - x - 3,

[formula].

Thus, with i = 2 and since d = 3 and δ = 4, Eq. ([\ref=p_(i+1)]) gives

[formula]

as claimed.

Using the algebraic approach, we can also derive some properties of the edge-intersection numbers, apart from the trivial one ãi  +  i  +  i  =  δ. As an example, we have the following:

Proof. In the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm_edr_is_dr_algebraic], we have already shown that, if w∈Vi,i - 1 then, [formula]. Similarly, one can prove that, if w∈Vi,i + 1, then [formula]. Since, in both cases, [formula], the two values must be equal and the result follows.   [formula]
