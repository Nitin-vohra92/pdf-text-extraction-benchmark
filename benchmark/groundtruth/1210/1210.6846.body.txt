On maximizing the speed of a random walk in fixed environments

Introduction

Procaccia and Rosenthal [\cite=procaccia2012need] studied how to optimally place given number of vertices with a positive drift on top of a simple random walk to minimize the expected crossing time of an interval. They ask about extending their work to the situation where the environment on [formula] is composed of two point types: [formula] and [formula] for [formula]. This is the goal of this note. See [\cite=procaccia2012need] for background and further related work.

Consider nearest neighbor random walks on 0,1,...,N with reflection at the origin. We denote the random walk by [formula] , and by [formula] the transition probability at vertex i:

[formula]

First, we prove the following proposition concerning the expected hitting time at vertex N:

For a walk ω starting at x, the hitting time [formula] satisfies:

[formula]

where [formula], and [formula] stands for the expected hitting time. In particular:

[formula]

The expected hitting time from 0 to N is symmetric under reflection of the environment, i.e. taking the environment [formula] gives [formula].

Next we turn to the case of an environment consisting of two types of drifts, [formula] (i.e. probability q to go to the right and 1 - q to the left) and [formula], for some [formula]. Assume that k of the vertices are p-drifts, and the rest are q-drifts. In [\cite=procaccia2012need] it was proven that for [formula] equally spaced p-drifts minimize [formula] (for large N). In this paper we extend this result for [formula]. We define an environment in which the p-drifts are equally spaced (up to integer effects):

[formula]

and prove the following theorem:

For every ε > 0 there exists n0 such that for every N > n0 and environment ω:

[formula]

where k is the number of p-drifts in ω.

Finally, we consider the set of environments ωak,k for some [formula], and calculate [formula] :

Let [formula]. Then:

[formula]

Proof of the main theorem

Define [formula] for 0  ≤  x  ≤  N. By conditioning on the first step:

vN = 0

v0 = v1 + 1

[formula]

To solve these equations, define ax = vx - vx - 1 (for 1  ≤  x  ≤  N) and bx = vx + 1 - vx - 1 (for 1  ≤  x  ≤  N - 1). Then:

[formula]

We get for ax the relation ax + 1  =  ρxax  -  ρx - 1, whose solution is [formula], and then:

[formula]

To evaluate [formula] we define:

[formula]

Next define [formula] for k in the circle [formula], such that for 1  ≤  k  ≤  N - 1 we will have [formula] (gluing the point 0 to the point N - 1), and then look at:

[formula]

This way, rather than summing [formula] over subintervals [formula] of

[formula]

Define [formula]. Since β  <  α < 1:

[formula]

for some constant [formula] which doesn't depend on N.

Let [formula] be the number of p-drifts in the interval [formula].

Since every drift appears in d intervals of length d, [formula]. Also,

[formula]

where [formula].

For [formula] the expression σd is minimized under the restriction [formula] if [formula] for all i,j.

For convenience, we omit d from the notation, and set [formula]. If a vector [formula] satisfies [formula], we say [formula] is almost constant. We will show that σ is minimal for some almost constant vector. Then we show that σ takes on the same value for all almost constant vectors under the restriction, and this completes the proof.

Suppose σ is minimized (under the restriction) by some vector [formula]. If [formula] is almost constant, we are done. Else, for some i,j we have that [formula]. We choose i,j such that is maximal. Define:

[formula]

[formula] satisfies the restriction, and [formula]:

[formula]

where the inequality follows from the fact that [formula] and n0j < n0i - 1. From minimality of [formula], we get that [formula] is also minimal. This process must end after a finite number of steps f, yielding an almost constant [formula] which minimizes σ.

Now for a general almost constant vector [formula], set [formula]. We have [formula], so defining m0 to be the number of a's and m1 to be the number of a + 1's, we get:

[formula]

and since m1 < N - 1, there is a unique solution for natural a,m1. So all almost constant [formula] (satisfying the restriction) are the same up to ordering, and since σ doesn't depend on the order, they all give the same value.

For every choice of M,k, the placement of k drifts on the circle [formula] in which the ith drift is at the point [formula] satisfies:

[formula]

Place the ith drift at the point [formula]. We calculate the number of drifts in the interval [formula]. The first drift inside this interval is:

[formula]

The last drift inside this interval is:

[formula]

The number of drifts inside this interval is therefore:

[formula]

So for non-integer [formula] the number of drifts takes on only the two values [formula]. For integer [formula] we simply have:

[formula]

[formula] is minimal for the configuration of drifts described by ωN,k (where the ith drift is at vertex [formula]).

[formula], and by claims [\ref=clm:min_sigmad] and [\ref=clm:drift_placement] each σd is minimized by this configuration, therefore the sum is also minimized.

From Proposition [\ref=prsn:circle_approximation], [formula]. Let [formula]. Then for N > n0:

[formula]

where we denote by S*N and [formula] the values caculated for ωN,k.

We evaluate [formula]. First, we consider the k intervals that do not contain any β, each of which contributes:

[formula]

Next we consider the k intervals that contain [formula] β's:

[formula]

Then we get:

[formula]

and since [formula] from Proposition [\ref=prsn:circle_approximation], the proof is complete.

Further questions

Show that the optimal environment also minimizes the variance of the hitting time.

Can this result be extended to a random walk on [formula] with a given density of drifts (as in [\cite=procaccia2012need])?

Can similar results be found for other graphs? For example, [formula].
