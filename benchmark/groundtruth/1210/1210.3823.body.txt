The turbulent/nonturbulent interface in boundary layers

Introduction

The flow simulated is a turbulent boundary layer from Reθ = 300 to ≃2500, where only the last fourth of the computational domain has been represented. The portion shown is 10δ99 wide and 12δ99 long. The visualized width corresponds with the simulated width, hence the contours are periodic in the spanwise direction. All the contours presented are coloured with the distance to the wall.

The first scene corresponds to a contour for a value of enstrophy, defined as the magnitude of the vorticity fluctuations, equal to 10% the value at the wall. This value is one order of magnitude higher to what is usually taken as a threshold for the turbulent / nonturbulent interface, and tube-like structures are clearly seen in the region further from the wall. The same temporal evolution is repeated several times.

In the second scene the previous threshold is changed from 10% the value of the wall to 1%, a value that generates a connected and relatively smooth surface. This second value for the threshold is in the range of what is used to research the turbulent / nonturbulent interface as a surface.

The third scene is the same temporal evolution of the first one, but with the contour taken for the second value of enstrophy.
