Non-detection of pulsed radio emission from magnetar Swift J1834.9-  0846: constraint on the fundamental plane of magnetar radio emission

Introduction

Magnetars are assumed to be neutron stars powered by strong magnetic field decay (Duncan & Thompson 1992). They form a different pulsar population from that of rotation-powered pulsars. Normal rotation-powered pulsars are usually radio emitters. Radio emitting rotation-powered pulsars are commonly known as radio pulsars. However, magnetars manifest themselves mainly as anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs)(Tong et al. 2010, 2011). Until recently, no radio pulsations had been observed from any of the magnetars. The discovery of transient pulsed radio emission from one magnetar has bridged the gap between radio pulsars and magnetars (Camilo et al. 2006). Up to now, more than twenty magnetars have been discovered . Three of them are radio-loud magnetars (Camilo et al. 2006, 2007; Levin et al. 2010).

Recently, Rea et al. (2012) tried to understand magnetar radio emission from an empirical point of view. They proposed that magnetars are radio-loud if and only if their quiescent X-ray luminosities are smaller than their rotational energy loss rates: [formula]. This is the key point of the "fundamental plane" of magnetar radio emission. Since Rea et al. (2012) published their paper, there are two new sources up to now: SGR Swift J1822.3-  1606 and SGR Swift J1834.9-  0846. For the young magnetar Swift J1834.9-  0846, the upper limit of its quiescent X-ray luminosity is lower than its rotational energy loss rate (Kargaltsev et al. 2012). This source should be another radio-loud magnetar if the fundamental plane of magnetar radio emission proposed by Rea et al. (2012) is correct.

X-ray Observations of Swift J1834.9-  0846

According to Kargaltsev et al. (2012), Swift J1834.9-  0846 has a rotation period of 2.48  s and a period derivative [formula] s s- 1. Its characteristic magnetic field is [formula]. It may also be associated with the supernova remnant W41 (Tian et al. 2007; Kargaltsev et al. 2012). Therefore, Swift J1834.9-  0846 is similar to the radio emitting magnetar AXP 1E 1547.0-5408 (Camilo et al. 2007): they have similar rotation period and similar characteristic magnetic field, and both are young sources in association with supernova remnants. The rotational energy loss rate of Swift J1834.9-  0846 is [formula]. According to figure 3 in Kargaltsev et al. (2012), Swift/XTR observed a declining flux of Swift J1834.9-  0846. From figure 3 there, the upper limit of the source's quiescent flux is: fqui  <  3  ×  10- 12  erg  cm- 2  s- 1. The corresponding upper limit of the source's quiescent luminosity is Lqui  =  4πd2fqui < 5.7  ×  1033d24  erg  s- 1. Here the source distance is chosen as 4  kpc, considering its potential association with the supernova remnant W41 (Tian et al. 2007; Kargaltsev et al. 2012). Furthermore, pre-outburst XMM and Chandra observations showed that the source flux was about 100 and 1000 times smaller, respectively (Section 3.3.2 in Younes et al. 2012; Section 6.2.3 in Kargaltsev et al. 2012). Therefore, the quiescent luminosity of Swift J1834.9-  0846 must be smaller than its rotational energy loss rate.

This source meets all the criteria of the fundamental plane of magnetar radio emission from Rea et al. (2012).

It lies relatively nearby. A possible distance of 4  kpc is obtained considering its potential association with supernova remnant W41.

If the fundamental plane proposed by Rea et al. (2012) was correct, Swift J1834.9-  0846 should have radio emission. And from previous experience of magnetar radio emission, we should detect its radio emission in recent years. Therefore, Swift J1834.9-  0846 provides us the first opportunity to test the "fundamental plane" of magnetar radio emission.

Radio observations, data analysis and results are presented in section 2. Discussions and conclusions are given in section 3.

Radio observations, data analysis and results

We have observed this source for [formula] hours, with one hour folding mode and the other searching mode. Here, we mainly discuss the searching observation and data analysis. The searching data were first checked for the presence of non-dispersed radio frequency interference (RFI). Interference signals above our set 5σ threshold level were removed from the raw data prior to our analysis.

Radio Observations of Swift J1834.9-  0846

The observation of Swift J1834.9-  0846 was made using Nanshan 25 meter radio telescope (Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory) on 24 June, 2012 for 1.0 hour. Data were taken with the cryogenic receiver at a center frequency of 1540 MHz. A bandwidth of 320 MHz was used in our observation, split into 128 continuous 2.5 MHz frequency channels (Wang et al. 2001). Dual linear polarizations were summed, and the frequency channels were one-bit sampled every 1.0 ms. The data were recorded on computer disk and transferred from the observatory to a linux computing server for processing. No pulsed radio emission is detected .

Folding Search

The data were analysed using the pulsar signal processing package SIGPROC (Lorimer et al. 2000). The maximum dispersion measure (DM) detected in the known pulsars is 1456 pc cm- 3. According to the NE2001 model for the galactic distribution of free electrons (Cordes & Lazio 2002), Swift 1834.9-  0846 has a DM of 197 pc cm- 3 assuming the distance of 4 kpc. So the data were de-dispersed using 750 trial DMs ranging from 0 to 1500 pc cm- 3. For each DM trial, the full 320 MHz of bandwidth was de-dispersed.

A barycentric folding period was determined using measurement from previous X-ray observation of Swift J1834.9-  0846. With the reported period and its associated uncertainties from the [formula] observations, we extrapolated the period to the 24 June, 2012 epoch and determined the barycentric folding period to be 2.48249785(10) s.

Periods ±  5 ms (~  0.2%) from the nominal period were searched with a step of 0.01 ms. Each of these folding trials was conducted for DMs between 0 and 1500 pc cm- 3 with steps 2 pc cm- 3. A total of 375,000 DM and period combinations were tried (750 DM trials, and 500 folds per DM trial), and for each trial the χ2 significance of the folded profile was recorded. We chose 5σ as a reasonable threshold for the signal, and we found no convincing pulsar candidates at the 5σ significance level or higher in the search. At the same time, we also searched for periodic signal using FFT with SEEK program at each tried DM. No pulsar candidate was found in this observation.

Upper Limit on Pulsed Radio Emission

The minimum detectable flux density can be given by the function (Manchester et al. 1996)

[formula]

It is affected by system noise Tsys, telescope gain G, number of polarizations Np, integration time Δt, receiver bandwidth Δν, assumed signal to noise ratio α, digitization and other processing losses β, pulsar period P and effective pulse width We. The effective pulse width depends on the intrinsic pulse width W, the sampling time δt, the dispersion smearing time across one sub-channel δtDM and the interstellar scattering boarding δtscatt

[formula]

where δt = 1  ms, δtDM  =  8.3  ×  106  DM  ν- 3MHz  B  ms  =  1.136  ms, [formula] with central frequency ν  =  1540  MHz, DM  =  200  - 3  pc, and bandwidth B  =  2.5  MHz (Lyne & Graham-Smith 2012). The intrinsic pulse width was assumed to be 0.05  P (Lazarus et al. 2012). The effective pulse width will be 0.05  P when the sum of the three contributions is much less than the intrinsic pulse width. For Nanshan 25 meter radio telescope pulsar observing system (Tsys = 40 K, G = 0.1 K Jy- 1, Np = 2, Δt = 3600 s, Δν  =  320 MHz, β = 1.5), we set α equal 5. Then, we obtain an upper limit on pulsed radio emission from Swift 1834.9-  0846 as 0.5 mJy.

Discussions and conclusions

According to Rea et al. (2012), a magnear will emit radio pulsations if and only if its quiescent X-ray luminosity is smaller than its rotational energy loss rate: [formula]. Swift J1834.9-  0846 meets all the criteria of the fundamental plane of magnetar radio emission. If the proposal of Rea et al. (2012) was correct, then it should have radio emission. However, we detect no pulsed radio emission from this source. It may be that magnetars with [formula] might have radio emission. At the same time, they can also have no radio emission. Despite the original proposal of Rea et al. (2012), [formula] may only be a necessary condition for a magnetar to emit radio pulsations. In the Rea et al. (2012) paper, two of five sources with [formula] have no radio emission. With the addition of Swift J1834.9-  0846, a total of six sources have [formula]. Three of them have radio emissions (AXP XTE J1810-  4197, AXP 1E 1547.0-  5408, and PSR J1622-  4950). While the other three are not detected in radio (PSR J1846-  0258, SGR 1627-  41, and Swift J1834.9-  0846). It is possible that the three later magnetars are actually radio emitting sources. Their radio emissions could have been missed because of beaming, absorption due to the environment or large distances etc (Rea et al. 2012). However, we also want to highlight the possibility that they do not have any radio emission at all.

The X-ray emissions of magnetars are magnetism-powered. They have nothing to do with the rotational energy loss rate (Thompson et al. 1996, 2002). However, the fundamental plane of magnetar radio emission links the magnetar quiescent X-ray luminosity with its rotational energy loss rate. Rea et al. (2012) did this since they believed that the radio emissions of magnetars are rotation-powered. However, the characteristics of magnetar radio emission are very different from that of radio pulsars (Mereghetti 2008): a variable flux and pulse profile, a flat spectra, and most importantly it is transient in nature. If the radio emissions of magnetars are rotation-powered, the same as that of radio pulsars, we should see similar radio emission properties in radio magnetars and radio pulsars. However, this is not what has been observed (Camilo et al. 2006, 2007; Levin et al. 2010). We find it reasonable to think that the magnetar radio emission comes from a different energy reservoir. In the case of magnetars, the natural energy budget is the magnetic energy. Therefore, the radio emissions of magnetars may be magnetism-powered instead of rotation-powered. The X-ray emissions of magnetars can vary significantly. Then it is not surprising that their radio emissions are also variable, since they are from the same energy reservoir.

For some magnetars, they can also have relative short period (e.g., AXP 1E 1547.0-  5408 has a period of 2.1   sec , Camilo et al. 2007). The rotational energy is also very significant. Therefore, we may also expect some rotation-powered activities in magnetars (Zhang 2003). For example, there may also exist rotation-powered radio emissions in magnetars. Therefore, there could be two types of radio emissions in magnetars: magnetism-powered radio emission and rotation-powered radio emission. At present, only transient pulsed radio emissions are observed in magnetars. They are more likely to be magnetism-powered. In the future, more radio-loud magnetars will be discovered (e.g., by FAST or SKA). Among them, we may also see pulsed non-transient radio emissions in some magnetars, with properties similar to that of ordinary radio pulsars. These radio emissions may be rotation-powered.

At present, three of six sources with [formula] have radio emissions. One physical reason is that: low luminosity magnetars tend to have similar magnetospheric structure as that of radio pulsars (Section 4.2 in Tong et al. 2012). The coherent radio emission condition is more likely to be fulfilled in low luminosity magnetars. Only a relatively low X-ray luminosity is required. It has few relation with the magnitude of rotational energy loss rate. Therefore, the "fundamental plane" of magnetar radio emission (if it exists) should be: "low luminosity magnetars are more likely to have radio emissions". Nothing further can be said. Since the Nanshan telescope is relatively small (25 meters in diameter), only a crude upper limit is obtained. Continued monitoring at other radio telescopes is highly recommended.

In summary, previously Rea et al. (2012) said that the necessary and sufficient condition for a magnetar to emit in radio is [formula] (quiescent X-ray luminosity smaller than the rotational energy loss rate), and the radio emission is powered by the star's rotational energy. Based on our observation on Swift J1834.9-  0846, we want to point out an alternative possibility.

Since Swift J1834.9-  0846 is not detected in radio (in contradiction with the prediction of Rea et al. 2012), [formula] may only be a necessary condition.

Considering the differences between radio emissions of magnetars and normal radio pulsars, it is more reasonable to think that radio emissions of known magnetars are powered by their magnetic energy (instead of rotational energy proposed by Rea et al. 2012).

If the radio emissions of magnetars are powered by their magnetic energy, and combining theoretical studies of magnetar magnetosphere (Tong et al. 2012), then the necessary condition for a magnetar to have radio emission may have little to do with its rotational energy loss rate. Only a relatively low X-ray luminosity is required.
