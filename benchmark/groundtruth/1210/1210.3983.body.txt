Astrometric determination of white dwarf radial velocities with Gaia?

Astrometric determination of WD radial velocities with Gaia?

Introduction

Usually, the determination of radial velocities of stars relies on the shift of spectral lines by the Doppler effect. [\citet=RusselAtkinson:1931] and [\citet=Oort:1932] already noted that due to the large proper motion and parallax of the white dwarf (WD) van Maanen 2, a determination of the perspective acceleration of the proper motion would provide a direct astrometric determination of the radial velocity which is independent of the gravitational redshift. If spectroscopic redshift measurements of Hα and Hβ NLTE cores exist, a purely astrometric determination would allow disentangling the gravitational redshift from the Doppler shift.

The best instrument for measuring the tiny perspective acceleration is the Gaia satellite of the European Space Agency, aiming at absolute astrometric measurements of one billion stars down to 20th magnitude with unprecedented accuracy. At 15th magnitude, the predicted angular accuracy of Gaia is ~  20 micro-arcseconds (μas). In this article, we estimate whether it is possible to measure the radial velocity of WDs astrometrically by the exchange of proper motion into radial velocity during the 5-year mission of the satellite or by combining Hipparcos data with the position measurements at the beginning of the Gaia mission (the Hundred-Thousand-Proper-Motion project HTPM).

Perspective acceleration

Since stars move with (almost) constant velocity through space, the proper motion [formula] as seen from an observer varies inversely with the distance to the object and also changes due to the varying angle between the line of sight and the space-velocity vector [\cite=Dravins-etal:1999]. Both effects lead to an apparent change in proper motion of [formula] [\citep=vandeKamp:1967] [\citep=Murray:1983], where π denotes the parallax of the star. Conversely, this means that the radial velocity can be determined astrometrically from [formula]

As summarized by [\cite=Dravins-etal:1999], past attempts to measure perspective acceleration yielded barely significant or spurious results. A high accuracy in terms of the astrometric radial velocity was only obtained for Barnard's star [\citep=vandeKamp:1981] and for van Maanen 2 [\citep=GatewoodRussel:1974]. By combining positions and proper motions from Hipparcos and old position measurements from the Astrographic Catalogue [\cite=Eichhorn:1974], [\citet=Dravins-etal:1999] determined astrometric radial velocities for sixteen stars, albeit with modest precisions.

The Hundred-Thousand-Proper-Motion project

The HTPM project is part of the first intermediate release of the Gaia data and will contain the proper motions of ~  113,500 stars using an ~  23-year baseline. The proper motions will be based on the Hipparcos data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) at the first epoch (1991.25) and Gaia positional data at the second epoch (~  2014.25). For this catalogue, [\cite=deBruijneEilers12] determined that for nearly 100 stars, the radial velocities available in the literature are insufficiently precise to correct for the perspective acceleration. Generally, stars with a large product μπvr, i.e., nearby, fast-moving stars, are good candidates for measuring radial velocities through astrometry.

Perspectives for white dwarfs

We estimated the accuracy of astrometric vr determinations with Gaia by investigating the 39 WDs either having Hipparcos astrometry themselves [\citep=Vauclair-etal:1997] or wide companions with Hipparcos measurements [\citep=GouldChaname:2004].

First, we estimate the accuracy using HTPM data only. In this case, we have positions φ1991.25 and proper motions μ1991.25 determined at epoch 1991.25 and only positions φ2014.25 from Gaia at ~  2014.25. φ2014.25 combined with the φ1991.25 positions provide a second proper-motion measurement (symbolically: μ  =  (φ2014.25  -  φ1991.25)  /  T). The standard error of the astrometric vr can be estimated by [\citep=Dravins-etal:1999]

[formula]

with T  =  2014.25  -  1991.25 and ε(μ) the accuracy of the proper-motion measurements. The expected HTPM proper-motion standard errors are ~  30-190 μas yr- 1, depending on magnitude. For our 39-star sample, the best accuracy for the astrometric radial velocity using only HTPM data is 282 km s- 1 for HIP57367 (column 10 in Table [\ref=tab:summary]), which is too large to be of any scientific value.

Second, we estimate the accuracy using the Gaia data only. The achievable accuracy for quasi-continuous observations during a period of length L (5 years in the case of Gaia) is given by [\citep=Dravins-etal:1999]:

[formula]

Since all stars in our sample are bright for Gaia, the end-of-mission accuracy ε(μ) amounts to ~  3.5  μas yr- 1 [\citep=deBruijne:2012b]. For this case, three stars (HIP 3829 = van Maanen 2, 21088 = Gl 169.1B, and 57367 = GJ 440) have predicted standard errors below 10 km s- 1 (column 12 in Table [\ref=tab:summary]). Five objects have predicted standard errors between 20 and 60 km s- 1, which is of the order of the mean gravitational redshift in DA WDs, which is about 33 km s- 1 [\citep=Falcon-etal:2010].

Conclusions

An astrometric determination of radial velocities of WDs with Gaia data is possible but limited to a few bright, nearby objects. The accuracy of the HTPM catalogue, which will be released early during the Gaia mission, is by far not large enough for an astrometric radial velocity determination of WDs. A breakthrough in this area would require a second micro-arcsecond astrometry mission, the data of which would have to be combined with the Gaia data [\citep=2010IAUS..261..342A].
