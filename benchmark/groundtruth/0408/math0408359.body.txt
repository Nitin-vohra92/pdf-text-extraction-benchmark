Lower-Order Terms of the 1-Level Density of Families of Elliptic Curves

Introduction

The Katz-Sarnak philosophy predicts that statistics of zeros of families of L-functions are strikingly universal. However, subtle arithmetical differences between families of the same symmetry type can be detected by calculating lower-order terms of the statistics of interest. In this paper we calculate lower-order terms of the 1-level density of some families of elliptic curves. We show that there are essentially two different effects on the distribution of low-lying zeros. First, low-lying zeros are more numerous in families of elliptic curves E with relatively large numbers of points [formula]. Second, and somewhat surprisingly, a family with a relatively large number of primes of bad reduction has relatively fewer low-lying zeros.

We also show that the lower order term can grow arbitrarily large by taking a biased family with a relatively large number of points [formula] for all small primes p.

Preliminaries and Notation

Let [formula] be an elliptic curve with associated L-function L(s,E) and conductor N. By work of Wiles and others ([\cite=Wiles], [\cite=TaylorWiles], [\cite=BCDT]) there is a weight two primitive holomorphic cusp form f on Γ0(N) such that L(s,E)  =  L(s,f). The completed L-function Λ(s,E) is entire and, with our normalization, satisfies the functional equation Λ(s,E)   =      ±   Λ(1  -  s,E).

We are interested in the distribution of zeros of Λ(s,E), especially zeros at or near the central point. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture provides motivation for the interest in critical zeros, and random matrix theory provides tools for studying zeros near the central point. It is our hope that insight can be gained into ranks of elliptic curves by studying the finer details of the distribution of zeros at or near the central point.

Consider the following 'density,' where φ is an even Schwartz-class function whose Fourier transform [formula] has compact support, [formula] runs over the nontrivial zeros of L(s,E), and X is a scaling parameter at our disposal. Since φ has rapid decay, D(E;φ) is essentially a measure of zeros of distance ≪  ( log X)- 1 from the central point. In our notation we suppress the dependence of D(E;φ) on X.

Our goal in this paper is to study the finer details of the asymptotics (as X  →    ∞  ) of the 1-level density for some families of elliptic curves. Katz and Sarnak have made predictions on the asymptotic behavior of the 1-level density for general families of L-functions ([\cite=KSM], [\cite=KS]). The asymptotic behavior is governed solely by the symmetry type of the family. However, the lower-order terms in the 1-level density heavily depend on the arithmetical nature of the family.

There is a large body of work on the 1-level density for a variety of families of L-functions (e.g. [\cite=FI], [\cite=ILS], [\cite=KSM], [\cite=R]). Additionally, S. J. Miller [\cite=M] and the author [\cite=Young] have investigated the main term of the 1-level density for various families of elliptic curves. Miller concentrates upon one-parameter families and considers both the 1-level and 2-level densities. The author focuses on large two-parameter families with test functions φ concentrated close to the origin. Fouvry and Iwaniec [\cite=FI] also obtained lower-order terms in their investigations.

Conrey and Snaith [\cite=CS] have developed a method for predicting lower order terms for an arbitrary family of L-functions. This method is based on the L-functions ratios conjectures of Conrey, Farmer, and Zirnbauer [\cite=CFZ]. Their work is powerful in its generality and conceptually quite illuminating, but of course it does not give unconditional results. If one were to apply their method to one of the families considered in this paper, then one would be led to essentially the same (unconditional) calculations that we carry out in this paper.

Statement of Results

The families of elliptic curves under scrutiny in this paper are the family of curves with torsion group [formula] and the family with torsion group [formula]. We study these families (as opposed to the family of all elliptic curves) because with these families we can more accurately estimate the average of the logarithm of the conductors (see Lemmas [\ref=lem:conductorestimate] and [\ref=lem:conductorestimate2]).

The following definitions precisely state which families we are considering and what are the corresponding weighting functions wX.

Any elliptic curve over [formula] with torsion group [formula] can be represented by a Weierstrass equation of the form y2  =  x(x - a)(x + b). We shall refer to F1' as the family of all elliptic curves with torsion [formula], even though the coprimality restrictions in the definition of F1' mean that our family is somewhat smaller. The coprimality restrictions are imposed for technical reasons, namely, in order to accurately compute the conductor; see Lemma [\ref=lem:conductor] for a formula for Na,b.

It is interesting to study the variation of the 1-level density of F1 as a0 and b0 vary mod q. The coprimality condition (q,a0b0(a0  +  2b0))  =  1 means Ea,b has good reduction at every prime dividing q.

The corresponding definition for the family with torsion [formula] is given by

For notational simplicity we use the common symbols Ea,b, Na,b, and λa,b(n) for both families F1 and F2. There should be no confusion because we shall always make clear to which family we are referring.

We define wX for F1 with the following

Likewise, for F2 we have

The conditions on the sizes of A and B are 'correct', because in Section [\ref=section:conductor] we show that for both families Fi so that we can think of wX as picking out curves E with conductor N  ≈  X. The reason that these are the right choices for A and B is that, for F1, say, Na,b  =  25a*b*(a  +  2b)* (here n* is the product of primes dividing n). If wX(Ea,b)  ≠  0, then [formula] and [formula], so for 'most' values of a and b, we should have log Na,b close to log (AB(A  +  2B))  ~   log X. Similar reasoning holds for F2.

Now we may state our main theorems For convenience to the reader we gather the constants together here. Let χNa,b be the principal Dirichlet character [formula]. We have

[formula]

Note that χNa,b(p) is well-defined in the above expression for d5,1(q), even though Na,b is not (the point is that the property of p dividing the conductor Na,b of y2  =  x(x - a)(x + 2b) only depends on a and b mod p).

As for the ci,1 we have

[formula]

and where [formula]. Actually, the formulas given above for e1,d5,1, and c5,1 are given by ([\ref=eq:e1]'), ([\ref=eq:d5]'), and ([\ref=eq:c5]'), respectively.

It may be of interest that the calculation of the lower-order terms is unconditional, but that obtaining the result for support up to 2 / 3 relies on the Riemann Hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions (but not the elliptic curve L-functions under consideration!). Eliminating the use of the GRH would force us to reduce the support. We also have

Similarly, for the family F2 we have Again we presently reproduce the constants. We have

[formula]

For the ci,2 we have

[formula]

and where [formula].

Here the support range is unconditional. It is likely that support up to 2 / 3 could be reached using methods in [\cite=Young], conditional on the GRH.

Again, we have

It is of interest to see how the 1-level densities of the families F1 and F2 vary as a0 and b0 vary [formula]. Since ei is the only constant depending on a0 and b0, Theorems [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder] and [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder2] show that the conditions [formula] and [formula] simply fix λa,b(p)  =  λa0,b0(p) for p|q (this can be seen as a sort of independence of primes since restricting a and b mod q does not affect the average behavior of λa,b(p) for (p,q)  =  1). We clearly see how relatively large -  λa0,b0(p) corresponds to (slightly) more zeros at or near the central point. It is well-known that an elliptic curve with positive rank should have larger -  λ(p)'s than an elliptic curve with zero rank; here we see a direct relationship between low-lying zeros and larger -  λ(p)'s. Conrey et al [\cite=CKRS] have noticed similar phenomena in the distribution of rank frequencies of quadratic twists of a fixed L-function. Namely, they observed a similar kind of independence of primes and also a slight increase in rank frequency when restricting to arithmetic progressions with a larger -  λ(p).

In Theorems [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder] and [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder2] we can also let q grow (slowly) with respect to X. In our proofs of the two theorems we exhibit the dependence on q of the implied constants in the remainder term. As long as q  ≪  Xε for ε small enough with respect to the support of [formula] we retain the desired asymptotic. The payoff is that we may choose a sequence of q's with biased λa0,b0(p) for all p|q so that ei(a0,b0) can grow with X. Precisely we let qn be the product of all odd primes p less than or equal to n. For each p select integers ap and bp such that Eap,bp has good reduction at p. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem take a0,n and b0,n such that [formula] and [formula] for all p  ≤  n. Notice that since Eap,bp has good reduction at all odd primes p  ≤  n, the conductor of each curve in the family is almost prime (that is, the conductor has no small prime factors except for the fixed power of 2). Then we may state For convenience we recall

[formula]

By taking biased λap,bp(p)'s we can show

[formula]

and for a different choice of ap, bp's we have

[formula]

These estimates translate to and respectively, where Ci is some positive constant. These estimates show there is a lot of variation in the low-lying zero density.

We now show why there exist such large values of ei. It will follow from the fact that and the elementary fact that for any λa,b(p) there exists a' and b' such that λa',b'(p)  =    -  λa,b(p). The above estimate on the maximal size of λ(p) is immediately deduced from where Li is a linear polynomial depending on the family only. This elementary computation is performed in Section [\ref=section:complete]

It is important to realize that we cannot take biased λ(p)'s for all p  ≤  n and n too large because it would necessarily contradict the Riemann hypothesis for an elliptic curve. Nevertheless, there should be quite a bit of freedom in choosing λ(p)'s for p relatively small.

Notice also that we are heavily using the fact that our elliptic curves are given by Weierstrass equations in order to piece together our family from local data. It would be of interest to make an analogous construction for general holomorphic cusp forms of, say, weight 2. Loosely speaking, suppose we are given a finite set of primes {pi} and modular L-functions {L(s,fi)} of weight 2 and relatively small level. Then the question is, can we produce a 'natural' family of modular L-functions {L(s,f)} (of weight 2 and ostensibly larger level) such that λf(pi)  =  λfi(pi) for all f and pi?

Analysis of the Constants and a Comparison of the Two Families

It is of interest to compare the lower-order terms of F1' and F2' (comparing general F1(a0,b0,q) and F2(a0',b0',q') is not straightforward since it is not clear how the congruence conditions on F1 should correspond to the congruence conditions on F2). Recall that the family F1' corresponds to a family with torsion [formula]; the family F2' corresponds to a family with torsion [formula].

In order to compare the lower-order terms of the two families we must scrutinize the constants ci,j. It is important to know what quantities are averaged to give these numbers. The interested reader should see Proposition [\ref=prop:explicitformula] for the form in which we have written the explicit formula. There are five distinct quantities over which we shall average; the constants c1,i through c4,i correspond to the first four such quantities, respectively. Averaging over the quantity on the last line of Proposition [\ref=prop:explicitformula] gives both c5,i and c6,i; we remove the restriction [formula] by summing over p|N separately. Summing over p|N gives c6,i, and summing over all p gives c5,i.

The first thing to notice after examining the various constants is that c1,i is the only constant associated to Fi that depends on the weighting function wX. We must properly choose our weighting functions in order to compare the two families in a natural way. We contend that the correct choices of wX should equalize c1,1 and c1,2. The constants c1,i give the lower-order approximation to the average of the logarithm of the conductors for the two families. The total number of zeros in the critical strip of height up to T of an elliptic curve L-function with conductor N is See [\cite=IK], Theorem 5.8, for instance. Therefore, equalizing c1,1 and c1,2 is equivalent to making the proper normalization of the high zeros of the two families.

Obviously c2,1  =  c2,2 because all elliptic curve L-functions have the same gamma factors in their functional equation.

Computing the numerical values of the remaining ci,j's is enlightening. We have

[formula]

The term c3,i is a measure of the effect of the primes dividing the conductor. For ν odd the quantity λνa,b(p) is oscillatory and does not contribute even a lower order term upon averaging over the family. On the other hand, λ2νa,b(p)  =  p-  ν for primes dividing the conductor, so the effect we are measuring is how many primes divide the conductor. The difference is that F1 has three essentially independent large factors and F2 has two essentially independent large factors (precisely, we show in Section [\ref=section:invariants] that for F1 we have Na,b  =  25a*b*(a  +  2b)* and for F2 we have Na,b  =  26b*(a2  +  b)*, n* here being the product of primes dividing n).

Next in this list we have

[formula]

Again, the difference between the two families is the number of primes dividing the conductor.

The most arithmetically interesting part arises from averaging λ(pν). Here we compute

[formula]

The reason c5,2 is significantly smaller than c5,1 is that for F2 we have for all p, whereas the corresponding sum for F1 is nonzero in general (numerical computations suggest that it is zero for p = 2 only). We also have

[formula]

Here again we have c6,i proportional to the number of independent divisors of the conductor of the family Fi.

By adding the relevant constants we see

[formula]

so that F2 has more low-lying zeros than F1. It is somewhat surprising that the lower-order terms for these two families are controlled more by the number of prime divisors of the conductors than by any subtle distributional properties of the λa,b(pν). Of course, for any p prime and s  ≥  1 / 2 we have so, all things otherwise being equal, there should be a correlation between many primes dividing the conductor N of an elliptic curve E and slightly larger values of L(1 / 2,E) (and perhaps slightly fewer low-lying zeros of L(s,E)).

Overview of the Proofs and Organization of the Paper

The proofs of Theorems [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder] and [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder2] follow from a careful evaluation using the explicit formula. The two proofs are exceedingly similar so we have endeavored to eliminate repetition as much as possible. In fact, we prove the two theorems in parallel. As a rule, we do the necessary computations for F1 and F2 in separate subsections of the same section. Often we first do a calculation more general than what we need and simply apply it to both families of interest. It is usually no extra work to do the calculations in greater generality and in fact it reduces repetition.

The result of Corollary [\ref=coro:loworder] (resp. Corollary [\ref=coro:loworder2]) will follow from the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder] (resp. Theorem [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder2]); the calculations will go through with q = 1. The constants ei, d1,i, and d2,i will be zero in this case. Of course the restrictions [formula] etc. are then always satisfied for q = 1.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=thm:qvaries] follows from the same lemmas that prove Theorems [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder] and [\ref=thm:mainthmloworder2]. The uniformity proven with respect to q allows q  ≪  Xε. Taking q to be the product of the odd primes less than or equal to n means we must restrict n by n  ≪  ε log X. One minor issue that arises is describing the behavior of the constants dl,i(q) as q  →    ∞  . It is easily seen these converge to the sum over primes in the corresponding cl,i, with error term of size O(n- 1)  =  O(( log X)- 1).

We state the explicit formula for an L-function attached to an elliptic curve in Section [\ref=section:explicitformula] (see Proposition [\ref=prop:explicitformula]). The overall goal, then, is to average each of the terms in the explicit formula. We average each term in a separate section.

In Section [\ref=section:invariants] we calculate the conductor of the curves Ea,b and the Dirichlet coefficients of L(s,Ea,b).

The conditions defining the families F1 and F2 are slightly thorny. In Section [\ref=section:sizes] we compute the sizes of the families, that is, we calculate the asymptotics of WX(Fi).

In the remaining sections we average the various terms of the explicit formula. The difficult parts are averaging the logarithm of the conductors (Section [\ref=section:conductor]) and computing the sums in Section [\ref=section:variation].

The Explicit Formula

We need a precise formulation of the explicit formula. Let E be an elliptic curve with L-function where χ0 is the principal Dirichlet character modulo the conductor N of E. We normalize L(s,E) to have central point s  =  1 / 2. The completed L-function is entire and satisfies the functional equation Λ(s,E)  =  wΛ(1 - s,E) where w  =    ±  1 is the root number of E.

Now we simply apply Theorem 5.12 of [\cite=IK] to L(s,E). It reads

[formula]

where [formula] and The contribution from the integral of γ' / γ is

[formula]

For p|N the logarithmic derivative of the local factor of L is so the contribution from such a p is

[formula]

The contribution from the primes not dividing N can be expressed in various ways (e.g. λ(pν), λν(p), or the parameters α(p), [formula] such that [formula]). We choose to make the derivation with respect to λ(pν). Since for [formula] we therefore have Using λ(p)λ(pν)  =  λ(pν  +  1)  +  λ(pν  -  1) (with the convention λ(p- 1)  =  0) gives

[formula]

Therefore the local integral contribution from this p is Now we have proved

Computing the Conductor and Dirichlet Coefficients

In this section we calculate the arithmetical quantities we will need in order to apply the explicit formula.

We briefly review some basic facts of elliptic curves. Suppose the curve [formula] is given by the general Weierstrass equation We have the canonical parameters The conductor N of E is a positive integer dividing Δ. There is no simple formula for N, but it can be computed by following an algorithm due to Tate (see [\cite=SilvermanAEC2], pp. 361-368 for a description). If the Weierstrass equation defining E is minimal then every prime dividing Δ also divides N (recall that a Weierstrass equation is minimal if Δ cannot be reduced by a change of variables). All curves in our families F1 and F2 are minimal. The following formula determines the power of p dividing N where δp(E) is a measure of wild ramification that may occur at the primes p = 2 and 3. If p  >  3 then δp(E)  =  0. The three cases above correspond to E having good reduction at p, multiplicative reduction at p, and additive reduction at p, respectively.

For convenience of notation we make the following Note that r1 and t1 codify the congruence conditions of the family F1 while r2 and t2 perform the same function for F2. We may unify the conditions for the two families by noting that the conditions are special cases of the congruences [formula], [formula].

The family y2  =  x(x - a)(x + b)

Consider the elliptic curve E given by the Weierstrass equation y2  =  x(x - a)(x  +  b). The curve E has discriminant Δ  =  16a2b2(a  +  b)2 and parameter c4  =  16(a2  +  ab  +  b2)  =  16((a  +  b)2  -  ab). If a and b are relatively prime then (c4,Δ) is a power of 2, and hence E does not have additive reduction at any primes p  ≠  2. Proof. By the discussion before the lemma, the odd part of N is simply the product of odd primes dividing ab(a  +  2b), which is a*b*(a + 2b)* because a and b are odd and coprime. It remains to compute ord2(N). We follow Tate's algorithm [\cite=SilvermanAEC2]. The point (0,0) is already singular mod 2. The algorithm terminates at step 4, since [formula] (note b8  =  4a2b2 and a and b are odd). Tate's algorithm says ord[formula], which is 5 since 2- 6Δ  =  a2b2(a  +  2b)2 is odd.

The following lemma provides a useful formula for the Dirichlet coefficients of L(s,Ea,b). Proof. The conditions (a,b)  =  1, a and b odd imply that the Weierstrass equation defining Ea,b is minimal, and hence that ([\ref=eq:lambdadef]) holds. We easily evaluate the sum when p|N.

The family y2  =  x(x2 + ax  -  b)

Consider the elliptic curve E given by the Weierstrass equation y2  =  x(x2  +  ax  -  b). E has discriminant Δ  =  16b2(a2  +  4b) and parameter c4  =  16(a3  +  3b). If a and b are relatively prime then (c4,Δ) is a power of 2. Proof. The odd part of N is easily shown to be as claimed. We need only compute ord2(N). We follow Tate's algorithm. First apply the change of variables x  →  x  +  1, giving the Weierstrass equation E':y2  =  x3  +  x2(2a  +  3)  +  x(4a  -  b  +  3)  +  (2a  -  b  +  1). The reduced curve E' mod 2 then has singular point (0,0). We have [formula], so the algorithm terminates at Step 3. Tate's algorithm reads that [formula]. We have [formula] since [formula].

Proof. Identical to that of Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaformula].

Computing the Size of the Families

In this section we compute the sizes of the families F1 and F2. Essentially we need to count pairs of coprime integers a and b that lie in specified arithmetic progressions.

A General Computation

It is useful to make the following Note that γ(l) is multiplicative.

Note. The second statement will not be applied until Section [\ref=section:primesdividing] but it is natural to prove it here.

Proof. We prove both statements simultaneously. Let q be either 1 or p and let S be the sum to be calculated. We have By Möbius inversion, we obtain

[formula]

Completing the sum in a mod l1 and b mod l2 gives Extracting the main term from the zero frequencies gives

[formula]

since if [formula] are distinct primes. We easily compute φ(q)γ(q2)  =  (p  +  1)- 1 in case q  =  p, and φ(q)γ(q2)  =  1 in case q  =  1.

The Family F1

The proof is a simple application of Lemma [\ref=lem:sizelemma]. By definition, Simply apply Lemma [\ref=lem:sizelemma] with l1  =  l2  =  2q. We easily compute γ(4q2)  =  γ(q2) / 3.

The Family F2

Proof. By definition, We compute γ(16q2)  =  γ(q2) / 12.

We now make the following Of course the prevous two lemmas showed WX(Fi)  ~  M(Fi).

The Conductor on Average

In this section we average the logarithm of the conductors of the families F1 and F2. This is the technically most difficult aspect of this paper. We are able to succeed with these two families essentially because the conductor factors into linear polynomials (roughly speaking, N  ≈  ab(a  +  2b)). The analogous calculation for the family of all elliptic curves would involve summing the logarithm of the product of primes dividing 4a3  +  27b2 (the summation being over a and b in appropriate ranges). Getting a precise asymptotic for this sum is an open problem.

A Sum with Squarefree Integers

In this section we evaluate a sum involving the squarefree part of integers. The calculation will be applied many times with various test functions and congruence conditions. We have By Lemma [\ref=lem:sizelemma] notice that ABγ(l)l- 1ζ- 1(2) is the asymptotic if log a *  is not present. The expected extra factor of log A to compensate for log a *  is correct but there is a rather large secondary term present. The outline of the proof is to execute the summation over b and reduce to a one-variable sum, to which we will apply Lemma [\ref=lem:onevar].

Proof. Let T be the sum to be computed. By Möbius inversion we have Applying Poisson summation in b mod l gives where Evaluating the summation over d gives The following lemma allows us to execute the summation over a and will complete the proof.

Proof. The overall idea is to use zeta function theory to evaluate S (that is, we use the Mellin transform of W to relate S to the values of a certain zeta function Z(s) and its logarithmic derivative at the point s = 1 (see [\eqref=eq:zetaexpression]).

Write a  =  a1a2 where a1 is squarefree and divisible by a*2 (such a representation is unique since the conditions imply a1  =  a*). We obtain Now write a1  =  a*2a3 (hence a*2 and a3 are coprime and both squarefree) and set [formula] to obtain

[formula]

Let S1 be the inner sum over a3 in ([\ref=eq:Ssum]) and set By Mellin inversion, where Then

[formula]

where Unfortunately, Z1 does not have an Euler product because of the restriction [formula] so write

[formula]

say. Zχ(s) has the following Euler product expansion

[formula]

The product is absolutely convergent for Re s  >  1 / 2 so that is holomorphic in Re s  >  1 / 2 except for a simple pole at s = 1 that occurs if and only if χ is the principal character ψl mod l. We evaluate S1 by moving the contour of integration to the line Re s  =  1 / 2  +  ε, picking up a pole at s = 1 for Zψl(s). On the line [formula] we have the bounds

[formula]

uniformly in l (using the Burdgess bound for L(s,χ)), and of course Thus we obtain

[formula]

uniformly in l. Inserting this expression for S1 into ([\ref=eq:Ssum]), we get

[formula]

Setting Vl(s)  =  Vψl(s) we obtain since [formula] and ψl(p)  =  1 for all p|a2 (because (a2,l)  =  1). Also, Hence

[formula]

It is natural to define for then

[formula]

A computation shows that Z(s) has the Euler product expansion

[formula]

We easily compute

[formula]

We compute so We now conclude which completes the proof.

The Average Conductor of the Family F1

In this section we evaluate the conductor on average. We have Note d1,1(1)  =  0.

Proof. Using Lemma [\ref=lem:conductor] and the additivity of the logarithm we write where S0,S1,S2, and S3 correspond to the terms with the logarithm factor log 25, log a * , log b * , and log (a   +   2b) * , respectively. By Lemma [\ref=lem:mass] we have An application of Lemma [\ref=lem:squarefreecalculation] shows Similarly, The estimation for S3 is only slightly different. We first change variables via a  →  a  -  2b; this leads to (recall A = B) where w*(x,y)  =  w(x - 2y,y). We easily see (0,0)  =  ŵ(0,0) and Now we've proved where is a constant depending on w only. Now the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:conductorestimate] is complete.

The Average Conductor of the Family F2

We have Proof. As in the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:conductorestimate], break the sum up into S0  +  S1  +  S2, where S0 corresponds to log 26, S1 corresponds to log b * , and S2 corresponds to log (a2   +   b) * . Obviously we have By Lemma [\ref=lem:squarefreecalculation] we easily have To handle S2 we apply the change of variables b  →  b  -  a2 and obtain where w*(x,y)  =  w(x,y - x2). An application of Lemma [\ref=lem:squarefreecalculation] gives Adding S0, S1, and S2 completes the proof.

The Gamma Factor

The gamma factor in the functional equation of L(s,E) is the same for every elliptic curve E so there will be no variation in our families.

Proof. Set The notation [formula] is standard. We use the representations and which are (8.362.2) and (8.363.1) in [\cite=GR], respectively. The first clearly shows Then

[formula]

where the odd powers of x do not appear because φ is an even function. Truncating the series at l  =  N introduces an error of order ( log X)- 2N  -  2. Extending the integration back to the entire real line does not introduce a new error term. Thus we obtain since Now the proof is complete.

The Contribution From The Primes Dividing The Conductor

An Application of Pólya-Vinogradov

It is convenient to state here the following Proof. Let S be the sum to be estimated. We may clearly assume (q,l1) = 1. Then

[formula]

By Pólya-Vinogradov, the summation over b is ≪  (l2q)1 / 2. Summing this bound over a and d completes the proof.

The Family F1

Proof. Let

[formula]

so that Write U(p,ν)  =  U1  +  U2 + U3, say, where U1,U2, and U3 correspond to [formula], [formula], and [formula], respectively (these conditions are mutually exclusive). When ν is even, λνa,b(p)  =  p-  ν / 2 for all a, b, and p under consideration. Thus for ν even and p  ≠  2 we have (recall λ(2)  =  0)

[formula]

where δ(p,2q) is the indicator function of (p,2q)  =  1, by Lemma [\ref=lem:sizelemma]. Of course U2 gives the same contribution as U1. The change of variable a  →  a  -  2b shows U3 also gives the same contribution as U1 (the change of variables does not alter ŵ(0,0)). By Lemma [\ref=lem:lambdaformula] we have for ν odd Simply apply Lemma [\ref=lem:polya] to obtain the bound for ν odd Again, U2 and U3 satisfy the same bound as U1.

Gathering these estimates, we obtain

[formula]

Now use the approximation (t)  =  (0)  +  O(t2) and execute the summation over ν to get and the proof is complete.

We mention that we could have used a higher-order Taylor polynomial to approximate [formula] to obtain a better asymptotic in ([\ref=eq:Tsum]).

The Family F2

Proof. The proof is essentially identical to that of Lemma [\ref=lem:Tlemma]. The reason the constant differs is that the conductor of a curve in F2 splits into two essentially independent factors, whereas for F1 there are three essentially independent factors.

In the course of discussion we proved

Evaluating a Main Term

The Prime Number Theorem

It will be necessary to use the following Proof. Let S be the sum on the right hand side above. Then by partial summation and by replacing θ(t) by t  +  R(t) we obtain

[formula]

Applying the obvious change of variables to calculate the first integral and using the approximations (x)  =  (0)  +  O(x2) and   '(x)  =  O(x) to estimate the second integral, we obtain

[formula]

as desired.

Both Families

Now we can easily prove Proof. We do the calculation for both families simultaneously. We first remove the restriction [formula]. We clearly have

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=lem:PNT] the first sum is By Corollary [\ref=coro:pdividingN] (with ν  =  0) we have for (p,2q)  =  1 where δ1  =  3 and δ2  =  2. Summing over (p,2q)  =  1 gives

[formula]

The contribution from p  =  2 is simply

By gathering terms the proof of the lemma is complete with

[formula]

with R(t) given by ([\ref=eq:R(t)]) (also recall δ1  =  3, δ2  =  2).

A Complete Character Sum Computation

The character sums Qi(pν) hold important arithmetical information about the distribution of zeros in families of elliptic curves. In this section we show Qi(pν)  =  0 for ν  =  2 and all ν odd. It is of interest to study such character sums for other families of elliptic curves. When obtaining a density theorem with large support for a family of elliptic curves it is necessary to study variants of Qi(p) where the sum is twisted by an arbitrary additive character modulo p. Such investigations are undertaken in [\cite=Young].

We first show that Q1(pν)  =  0 for ν odd. It is easy to see that for (p,N)  =  1 we have [formula], where dl  =  0 if [formula]. Hence we have for some [formula]. The problem reduces to showing each of the two sums above vanish.

For the first sum, we see that Take e such that (e / p)  =   - 1 and apply the change of variables yi  →  eyi, α  →  eα, β  →  eβ. We get the same sum multiplied by (e / p)3l; hence the sum is zero for l odd. A glance at ([\ref=eq:lambdaformular]) shows that the second sum vanishes.

The argument showing Q2(pν)  =  0 for ν odd is similar.

We now show Q1(p2) = 0. We use the identity λ(p2)  =  λ2(p)  -  1 for (p,N)  =  1 and λ(p2)  =  λ2(p) for p|N. The derivation is simple (assume p  ≠  2):

[formula]

Similarly,

[formula]

Note that Qi(pk) is not always zero. For instance, Q1(54)  =   - 216 / 25, Q1(74)  =  528 / 49, and Q2(36)  =   - 8 / 9. One can show that Q2(p4)  =  0 for all p, but the calculations are lengthy and tangential to our purpose here.

Both Families

Recall δ1  =  3 and δ2  =  2. We can also use the identity to find alternate expressions for c5,i, d5,i(q), and ei(a0,b0). Here χN is the principal Dirichlet character [formula]. Namely we have

[formula]

It is interesting that Lp(1 / 2,Ea0,b0) is visibly present in the expression for ei.

Proof. The basic idea is to simply complete the sum over a and b modulo p to write our sum in terms of a sum of Q(pν). For ν  ≥  3 this is completely straightforward. For ν = 2 some work needs to be done to show that the summation over p converges. The calculations in the previous section showing Q(p2)  =  0 are for this purpose (the trivial bound Q(p2)  ≪  p2 barely fails to succeed in showing the sum converges). The case ν  =  1 is in some sense a separate issue. If [formula] has small support (i.e. for p rather small) it is easy to show that there is no contribution from terms with ν  =  1. For larger support it becomes a difficult problem to prove the same result. See [\cite=Young] for a detailed investigation into such problems for a variety of families of elliptic curves.

It is convenient to extend the summation over all primes p. Write J  =  J'  -  J'', where J' is defined by the sum ([\ref=eq:fourierpart]) but with no restriction on p, and J'' is defined similarly but with the condition p|N. Since λ(2) = 0 we may freely assume p  ≠  2.

We first show

[formula]

Using Corollary [\ref=coro:pdividingN] and the approximation

[formula]

we have

[formula]

as desired.

It suffices to show Let so that We will calculate V(p,ν). In case p|q we then have by Lemmas [\ref=lem:mass] and [\ref=lem:mass2]. The contribution to J' from p|q is thus

[formula]

where This gives the term ei(a0,b0). From now on assume [formula].

We shall now prove the following approximation

[formula]

uniform with respect to q. This bound is nontrivial for [formula].

Proof of ([\ref=eq:Vpnutrivialestimate]). By Möbius inversion, where The restriction (d,p)  =  1 can be imposed because λ0,0(pν)  =  0 for all p,ν. Since Vd(p,ν)  ≪  d- 2(ν  +  1)AB we have for any R  ≥  1 the trivial estimate

[formula]

the implied constant depending on w only. Performing Poisson summation in a and b mod 2ipq gives

[formula]

where Computing Y by separating the variables via the Chinese remainder theorem we get If we estimate the nonzero frequencies of Vd trivially we get the estimates (for (d,2pq)  =  1) and hence

[formula]

Gathering the estimates ([\ref=eq:Vdtrivial]) and ([\ref=eq:Vdsmalld]) and taking R  =  (AB)ε we obtain ([\ref=eq:Vpnutrivialestimate]).

The case ν  =  1 requires special care so we first estimate the contribution to J'(Fi) from ν  ≥  2. For convenience we denote

[formula]

At this point take 0  <  ρ1  <  2 / 3, 0  <  ρ2  <  1 / 2 such that for each Fi we have [formula]. Then φ(p,ν)  =  0 for pν  ≥  Xρi. The inequality p  ≪  Xρi  /  ν implies [formula] for ν  ≥  2, i.e. the estimate ([\ref=eq:Vpnutrivialestimate]) is nontrivial in this range. Hence we easily obtain

[formula]

Here ε is bounded from above in terms of the support of [formula]. As ρ1 approaches 2 / 3 or ρ2 approaches 1 / 2 we must have ε approaching zero.

It remains to show for test functions [formula] supported in the desired ranges. The proofs (distinct for each family) are essentially carried out in [\cite=Young]. For small support the result follows from ([\ref=eq:Vpnutrivialestimate]).

By gathering the terms ([\ref=eq:J''sum]), ([\ref=eq:J'p=q]), and ([\ref=eq:J2']), the proof of Lemma [\ref=lem:J] is now complete.
