Transition strengths from [formula]B[formula]B D. J. Millener Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973

Introduction

The table of radiative widths from the 1979 Ajzenberg-Selove tabulation was based on the low-q results of Spamer [\cite=spamer66] (Darmstadt) for the 6.03-MeV 4+;0 level and the 7.48-MeV 2+;1 level, togther with the [formula] results of Fagg et al. [\cite=fagg76] (NRL) for a number of levels. The 1984 and 1988 tabulations added results based on the work of Ansaldo et al. [\cite=ansaldo79] (Saskatoon) for 0.61  <  q  <  1.81 fm- 1 but did not take into account the erratum to that work [\cite=ansaldo79].

The more recent work of Cichocki et al. [\cite=cichocki95] (NIKHEF) gives longitudinal and transverse form factors in the range 0.48  <  q  <  2.58 fm- 1 for most levels up to the 6.56-MeV 4-;0 level. The analysis in this work includes extensive shell-model calculations and the extraction of B(C2) values for five levels of 10B. The analysis also includes data up to q  ~  4 fm- 1 taken at [formula] for the ground-state, the 1.74-MeV level, and the 5.17-MeV level [\cite=hicks88] (Bates). For most transitions, the form factors are plotted as a function of the effective momentum transfer qeff  =  q(1 + 2.75 / E0), where the beam energy E0 is in MeV. This way of relating form factors in the plane-wave and distorted-wave Born approximations must also be applied to the data from the earlier works.

Cichocki et al. used a polymomial times Gaussian (e- y) in the variable y  =  (bq / 2)2, where b is the harmonic oscillator parameter, to represent the form factors and extract B(C2) values. The proceedure is spelled out by Millener et al. [\cite=millener89] who defined

[formula]

where f = fSNfc.m.e- y takes out the exponential dependences in the (theoretical) form factor. In the conventional definition of B(Cλ,q) and B(Mλ,q), we should set f = 1. Because nature does not know about fc.m. (and even in theory we don't need it if we use an appropiate system of relative coordinates), we perform the fit, with f = fSNe- y, to

[formula]

Corrections for electron distortion

We use the effective momentum transfer qeff  =  q(1 + 2.75 / E0) prescription [\cite=cichocki95] to approximately correct the original data for electron distortion so that we can use form factors calculated in the plane-wave Born approximation. This is especially important at low incident energies E0 and needs to be performed for the Darmstadt [\cite=spamer66], NRL [\cite=fagg76], and Saskatoon [\cite=ansaldo79] data as sketched in the next subsections.

Darmstadt data

The measured quantity is the ratio of inelastic to elastic cross section and we could use this data together with a modern parametrization of the elastic cross section. The derived quantity B(λ,q) is tabulated as a function of q2 where

[formula]

and k = Ex  /   and k0 = E0  /   (  =  197.32696 MeV.fm). We recalculate q and calculate qeff using the tabulated values of E0 and θ. The units for B(λ,q) are given as 10- 51 cm4  =  10 fm4 for C2 and 10- 28 cm2  =  10- 2 fm2 for M1. We absorb the factor of α  =  e2 from the expressions of Spamer [\cite=spamer66] so that B(λ,q) is expressed in the conventional units of e2.fm2λ. Then, from Eqs. ([\ref=eq:C]) and ([\ref=eq:M]) (with f = 1) in terms of the B(λ,q) tabulated in Ref. [\cite=spamer66]

for the longitudinal form factor of the 6.025-MeV 4+;0 level, and

[formula]

for the transverse form factor of the 7.477-MeV 2+;1 level.

NRL data

Fagg et al. [\cite=fagg76] give the [formula] cross sections in nb/sr (=  10- 7 fm2/sr) for three incident energies (40.5, 50.6, and 60.6 MeV and we have (e2  =  1.44 MeV.fm)

[formula]

with the recoil factor R = (1 + 2E0 / M) (M = nuclear mass, and e.g., R = 1.013 for E0  =  60.6 MeV) and q from Eq. ([\ref=eq:q]).

Saskatoon data

The data are already tabulated as form factors and we simply change q to qeff.

C2 transitions

In their appendix, Cichocki et al. [\cite=cichocki95] extract B(C2) values for five states using Eq. ([\ref=eq:Ba]), perhaps without the inclusion of the single-nucleon form factor fSN but this is essentially irrelevant at the photon point. For the 6.025-MeV level, the low-q data from Darmstadt and the Saskatoon data were also included. In the following subsections, we discuss fits to each level starting with the 6.025-MeV 4+;0 level. As in Ref. [\cite=cichocki95], the oscillator parameter is fixed at 1.60 fm. In principle, we could include b in the fit but it turns out that b = 1.60 fm is close to the optimum value. Besides a change of b in Eq. ([\ref=eq:Bb]) is compensated for by a change in A' when fitting to data. Of course, theoretical B(C2) values calculated with harmonic oscillator wave functions scale as b4.

The 6.025-MeV 4+;0 level

The original Darmstadt value for the B(C2) is 24.4  ±  2.5 e2fm4 (the inclusion of 5 data points from Orsay lead to a slightly smaller value of 23.4  ±  2.5 e2fm4) - this value is quite well reproduced in the first line of Table [\ref=tab:602]. Taking the effect of distortion into account via the qeff prescription results in a considerably lower value of 17.34  ±  1.97 e2fm4 (note that B(C2) = (b / 2)4  A2) as pointed out by Cichocki et al. [\cite=cichocki95] - taking the q values from Table 1 of Spamer [\cite=spamer66] instead of recomputing them gives B(C2) = 17.66  ±  1.98 e2fm4. Note that the parameter B is not well determined and that the e- y term in the oscillator form factor pretty much takes into account the terms involving the transition radius in the original Darmstadt paper. As the third line of Table [\ref=tab:602] shows one can obtain a one-parameter fit of similar quality but with a smaller error because of the restrictive nature of the fitting function. The fact that essentially a p-shell form factor fits so well is surprising because the transition is very strong and the higher-order terms responsible for this should lead to a B coefficient which is negative (e.g., the hamonic oscillator form factor for the 2ω giant quadrupole resonance is of the form y(1 - 1 / 3y)e- y and coherence at low q means a negative coefficient for the next term).

If we fit the NIKHEF data using a 3-parameter polynomial, the χ2/DF is 1.77; for the NIKHEF + Saskatoon data, it is 2.02. Adding an extra term to take care of the high-q behavior leads to some improvement (line 4 of Table [\ref=tab:602]). Removing the three data points with qeff  >  2 fm- 1 doesn't lead to much change, although a three-parameter fit is now possible, as the next two lines of Table [\ref=tab:602] show. The final three lines of Table [\ref=tab:602] show fits to the complete data set. The four-parameter fit gives B(C2) = 18.7  ±  0.7 e2fm4. To compare with the electromagnetic value for the 4+  →  gs transition, we multiply by 7/9 and convert to Weisskopf units (1 W.u. = 1.2797 e2fm4) getting 11.4  ±  0.4 W.u. This agrees with the electromagnetic value of 12.4  ±  1.8 W.u., which is derived from the ωγ value from the 6Li(α,γ) reaction and an E2/M1 mixing ratio.

The 0.718-MeV 1+;0 level

The lifetime for this long-lived level is precisely known, τ  =  1.020  ±  0.005 nsec. This corresponds to a B(C2) for electron scattering of 1.796(9) e2fm4. The value of 1.71(14) e2fm4 in the first line of Table [\ref=tab:072] derived from the NIKHEF data is in good agreement. Therefore including the electromagnetic value as a data point changes the χ2 only slightly. A three-parameter fit gives a significant increase in χ2.

The 2.154-MeV 1+;0 level

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:215] shows a 3-parameter fit to all the NIKHEF data points while the next line shows the same fit with the highest q data point removed. The 2-parameter fit in the third line shows very little deterioration in χ2. The last line shows a 1-parameter fit which is still acceptable in terms of χ2 but is certainly not as good as the other fits. The χ2 doesn't change for b = 1.56 fm or b = 1.66 fm and neither does B(C2) to any significant extent.

The electromagnetic data in the current tabulation gives 0.75(9) e2fm4 for the B(C2) up. This depends on a number of values for lifetime (2.13  ±  0.20 ps) and the ground-state branch (21.1  ±  1.6 %). Probably, the previous lifetime average of 2.30  ±  0.26 ps should be used but this only gets the the B(C2) down to 0.69 e2fm4 (the lowest γ-ray branch of 17.5% would give 0.57 e2fm4).

The 3.587-MeV 2+;0 level

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:359] shows a 3-parameter fit to all the NIKHEF data points which yields B(C2) = 0.616  ±  0.044 e2fm4 which is in reasonable agreement with the electromagnetic value of 0.85  ±  0.25 e2fm4. The latter depends on lifetime, branch, and mixing ratio.

The 5.920-MeV 2+;0 level

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:592] shows a 3-parameter fit to all the NIKHEF data points while the next line shows the same fit with the highest q data point removed. The 2-parameter fit in the third line shows very little deterioration in χ2. The same can be said of the 1-parameter fit in the last line but the B(C2) changes from 0.164 to 0.202 as b changes from 1.55 fm to 1.65 fm. In 2-parameter or 3-parameter fits the χ2 and B(C2) vary little with modest changes in b.

M3 transitions

In addition to the transition to the 1.74-MeV 0+;1 level, the transverse form factor to the 5.164-MeV 2+;1 level is dominantly M3 with a small correction for M1 at low q. The qeff prescription can be used on the Saskatoon data but the NIKHEF data for the 0+;1 level is given as a function of q and can't be corrected without a knowledge of E0 for each point. However, a B(M3) is available from a DWBA analysis of the data. Note that for A = 10, 1 W.u. = 35.548 μ2fm4 = 0.3932 e2fm6.

The 1.740-MeV 0+;1 level

We first note that Γγ  =  (1.05  ±  0.25)  ×  10- 9 from the original analysis of the Saskatoon data (see erratum of Ref. [\cite=ansaldo79]) corresponds to B(M3[formula] e2fm6 = (748  ±  178) μ2fm4.

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:174] gives B(M3[formula] μ2fm4 for a fit to the data as a function of q. This is reduced to (688  ±  101) μ2fm4 for a fit to the data as a function of qeff. The value from a DWBA fit to the complete data set shown in Ref. [\cite=cichocki95] is 633 μ2fm4 (R. Hicks, private communication).

The 5.164-MeV 2+;1 level

The original analysis of the Saskatoon data [\cite=ansaldo79] gave B(M3[formula] e2fm6 = (1953  ±  19) μ2fm4. This fit included an M1 contribution.

The first two lines of Table [\ref=tab:516] contain no correction for the M1 contribution at low q. The first line fits the Saskatoon and NIKHEF data as a function of qeff while the second line also contains the Catholic University of America low q data. A significant difference in the extracted B(M3) can be seen when the two points with qeff  <  0.8 fm- 1 are removed from the S+N data set (third line).

Finally, we subtract an M1 contribution calculated by normalizing the computed M1 shell-model form factor to the B(M1) obtained from electromagnetic data. Because there is such a large cancellation for the lowest q data point of the CUA data set, we omit this point entirely. This results in B(M3[formula] e2fm6 or (1756  ±  181) μ2fm4; B(M3[formula] e2fm6 or (69.1  ±  7.1) W.u. This corresponds to Γγ  =  (1.00  ±  0.10)  ×  10- 6 eV.

M1 transition for the 7.48-MeV level

Ansaldo et al. [\cite=ansaldo79] give Γ0γ  =  11.75  ±  0.75 eV for this strong M1 transition while Spamer [\cite=spamer66] gives Γ0γ  =  12.0  ±  2.2 eV. However, Chertok [\cite=chertok69] corrected the later value to 11.0  ±  2.2 eV after distortion corrections were taken into account. Note that 1 W.u. = 1.7905 μ2 = 0.0198 e2fm2.

The fit as a function of qeff in the first line of Table [\ref=tab:748] yields Γ0γ  =  10.84  ±  1.58 eV. Adding the CUA data points gives Γ0γ  =  11.00  ±  1.14 eV. The Saskatoon contains three points around the second maximum of the M1 form factor. Adding these data points gives a worse fit and Γ0γ  =  11.35  ±  0.37 eV. Increasing the number of parameters to three improves the fit but gives a substantially larger B(M1) value corresponding to Γ0γ  =  12.55  ±  0.58 eV.

As far as the B(M1) is concerned, it is preferable to stick with the value derived from the low-q data.

C3 transitions

Cichocki et al. [\cite=cichocki95] present data on the form factors for the 2-, 3-, and 4- levels at 5.110 MeV, 6.127 MeV , and 6.561 MeV. The longitudinal form factor for the isolated 6.56-MeV level is best defined. The C3 Weisskopf unit is 5.94 e2fm6.

The 6.56-MeV 4-;0 level

The C1 and C3 harmonic oscillator form factors for 1ω transitions cannot be distinguished. However, the shell-model calculations in Ref. [\cite=cichocki95] indicate the the C3 transition is dominant for the 4- level.

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:656] shows a 4-parameter fit to the full NIKHEF data set which shows that B,C, and D are not determined and that there is a large error on B(C3). The second line shows a 3-parameter fit and a significant change in B(C3) (but within errors). Because we are interested in pinning down a low-q parameter, the third line shows the effect of omitting the two highest q data points. Now C is undetermined and the final line shows a 2-parameter fit to the reduced data set (there is no change in the overall χ2). Then B(C3[formula]) = 21.8  ±  1.1 e2fm6 and B(C3[formula]) = 17.0  ±  0.9 e2fm6 = 2.9  ±  0.2 W.u.

The 6.13-MeV 3-;0 level

This form factor is not so well defined because of the difficulty of separating the cross section from the strong 4+ level at 6.025 MeV. Again, the shell-model calculations of Ref. [\cite=cichocki95] indicate the the C3 transition is dominant but in this case a significant C1 contribution is also predicted.

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:613] shows a 3-parameter fit to the full NIKHEF data set which is poor and gives a large error on B(C3). The second line shows the effect of omitting the two highest q data points and reducing the number of parameters by one. A better χ2 is obtained in the last line by omitting two high data points. Then B(C3[formula]) = B(C3[formula]) = 33.1  ±  2.7 e2fm6 = 5.6  ±  0.5 W.u.

The 5.11-MeV 2-;0 level

Here, the shell-model calculations of Ref. [\cite=cichocki95] indicate that the C1 transition is dominant over C3. In addition, there exists a non-zero B(E1[formula]) of (5.0  ±  1.0)  ×  10- 4 W.u. that arises from isospin mixing. This corresponds to B(E1[formula]) = (1.07  ±  0.21)  ×  10- 4 e2fm2.

The first line of Table [\ref=tab:511] assumes good isopsin and therefore no A coefficient. Allowing A to be non-zero improves the fit (second line). Including the photon point in the fit worsens the χ2 somewhat but still gives a reasonable fit.

Higher levels

Ansaldo et al. [\cite=ansaldo79] give a longitudinal form factor for a level at 8.07 MeV with a width of 760 keV, which they assign as 2+;0, and a transverse form factor for the 2+;1/3-;1 doublet at 8.9 MeV. Fitting the data for the 8.07-MeV level yields a B(C2[formula] e2fm4. This is about a quarter of the strength of the very strong transition to the 6.025-MeV 4+ level. As Zeidman et al. [\cite=zeidman88] note, this should lead to a very strong excitation in inelastic pion scattering which is not seen. In fact, even adding the cross sections for states at 7.8 and 8.07 MeV still gives less than 25% of the expected cross section for an isoscalar C2 excitation.

For the 8.9-MeV doublet, it is difficult to say anything much without guidance from the shell-model as to the dominant multipoles expected. The state is stronger than expected for an isovector excitation in inelastic pion scattering [\cite=zeidman88].
