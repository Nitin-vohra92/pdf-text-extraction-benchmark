Anomalous specific heat in ultradegenerate QED and QCD

Introduction

Cold dense quark matter has important deviations from Fermi-liquid behavior: below TCSCc  ~  6 to 60 MeV there is color superconductivity and long-range magnetic interactions are responsible for the fact that the energy gap is not proportional to exp ( - c / g2) as with short-range interactions, but instead to exp ( - c' / g).[\cite=Son:1998uk] [\cite=Rischke:2003mt] Above TCSCc, and for unpaired quarks also below, the only weakly (dynamically) screened magnetic interactions are also responsible for an anomalous behavior of entropy and specific heat, with a behavior Cv  ~  αsNgNfμ2T ln T- 1 first discovered in the context of nonrelativistic QED by Holstein, Norton, and Pincus[\cite=Holstein:1973] [\cite=Chakravarty:1995].

In QED this effect is probably unobservably small (though it may arise also from effective gauge field dynamics in systems of strongly correlated electrons), but in QCD it can be orders of magnitude larger because there are Ng = 8 gauge bosons instead of only one, and also αs is much larger than α. However, more recently the existence of this effect had been questioned by Boyanovsky and de Vega[\cite=Boyanovsky:2000zj], who instead found a αT3 ln T (when their renormalization-group summation of log's is undone).

In Ref.[\cite=Ipp:2003cj], we have recently confirmed the correctness of the original result and succeeded in calculating higher terms of the low-temperature expansion, for which only the coefficient of the leading log was known before. The higher terms involve cubic roots of temperature, which can be traced to the fact that the frequency-dependent screening length of quasi-static magnetic modes is given by[\cite=Weldon:1982aq] κ≃(πm2Dω / 4)1 / 3, where mD is the (electric) Debye mass.

Origin of the T ln T term

The non-Fermi-liquid behavior is usually discussed in terms of the spectral properties of the fermions. The leading fermionic contribution to the entropy density can be written as

[formula]

where it suffices to consider the particle ( + ) as opposed to antiparticle contribution. The T ln T behavior can then be obtained[\cite=Holstein:1973] from the singular behavior of the fermion self-energy at the Fermi surface[\cite=Holstein:1973] [\cite=Brown:1999aq] [\cite=Manuel:2000mk],

[formula]

However, it is not a priori justified to leave out the contributions from the gauge bosons. The entropy contributed by transverse modes can be written to two-loop accuracy as

[formula]

The fact that quasi-static transverse gauge bosons are only weakly screened by ΠT≃ - iπm2Dω  /  (4k) leads to nonanalytic behavior in T, which is exactly the same as that of the interaction part of Sf:

[formula]

It is only because S(B)≃  -  S(A) that Sf already gives the complete result to leading order.

If one organizes the calculation differently, as done in Ref.[\cite=Boyanovsky:2000zj] where the specific heat is extracted from the internal energy, one in fact finds that all T ln T terms as contributed by the fermions cancel out. However, as we have shown in Ref.[\cite=Gerhold:2004tb], the complete result is then coming from the internal energy of the gauge boson sector, explicitly neglected in Ref.[\cite=Boyanovsky:2000zj], which resolves the contradiction with the original results.

Complete leading-order results

It turns out that it is in fact advantageous to reorganize the calculation such that all anomalous contributions come from the gauge boson sector, by integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom first. This allows one to systematically calculate beyond the leading-log approximation without having to calculate the fermionic spectral densities beyond leading order. In Ref.[\cite=Gerhold:2004tb] we have most recently shown that the infinite series of anomalous contributions is contained in the following hard-dense-loop (HDL)[\cite=Braaten:1990mz] resummed expression valid for T  ≪  μ:

[formula]

Here S0 is the ideal-gas value of the entropy density, and g2eff = g2Nf / 2 in QCD, but e2Nf in QED.

At low temperature [formula], one finds that the Landau damping cuts of the HDL propagators give rise to a series of the form

[formula]

where the coefficients up to and including c4 can be found in Ref.[\cite=Gerhold:2004tb].

At [formula], one has also important quasiparticle contributions, most of which are invisible in the low-T expansion since they involve terms suppressed by factors of [formula]. For geffμ  ≪  T  ≪  μ, one finally makes contact with more familiar results from thermal perturbation theory, as [formula], where it is the longitudinal plasmon term [formula] which makes (HDL) resummation necessary. The expression ([\ref=Sfull]) thus interpolates between two physically rather different collective phenomena: the plasmon effect from (electric) Debye screening, which only arises at T  ≫  geffμ, and non-Fermi-liquid effects from the only dynamically screened magnetic interactions at T  ≪  geffμ, see Fig. [\ref=figSdetails].

Results for large and finite Nf

The above result ([\ref=Sfull]) is the leading-order result for both QCD and QED at T  ≪  μ. Higher-order terms either involve extra powers of g2 or T2  /  μ2 (but not at the same time higher powers of ln T)[\cite=Chakravarty:1995] [\cite=Schafer:2004zf].

One case where we can actually investigate quantitatively the importance of higher-order terms is in the exactly solvable limit of large flavor number, which has been worked out for finite chemical potential in Ref. [\cite=Ipp:2003jy]. Figure [\ref=figSfull] compares with the exact large-Nf result for geff(μ̄MS = 2μ) = 1,2,3, and we find that the HDL resummed result works well in the range where the entropy exceeds its ideal-gas value. The exact large-Nf result turns out to have even a slightly larger anomalous entropy.

In Fig. [\ref=figspecificheat] we finally give results for the specific heat at finite Nf, which shows its anomalous behavior for a potentially interesting range in T / μ.
