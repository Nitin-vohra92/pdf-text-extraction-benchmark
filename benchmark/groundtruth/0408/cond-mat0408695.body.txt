MESOSCOPIC PHASE SEPARATION IN THE MODEL WITH COMPETING JAHN-TELLER AND COULOMB INTERACTION.

There is substantial evidence that the ground state in many of oxides is inhomogeneous[\cite=egami]. In cuprates, for example neutron-scattering experiments suggest that phase segregation takes place in the form of stripes or short segments of stripes[\cite=bianconi] [\cite=mook]. There is some controversy whether this phase segregation is associated with magnetic interactions. On the other hand it is also generally accepted that the charge density in cuprates is not homogeneous.

The idea of charge segregation in cuprates appeared just after discovery of High-Tc materials [\cite=zaanen] [\cite=emery] [\cite=gorkov]. In most cases long-range Coulomb repulsion was not considered. Recently it was suggested that interplay of the short range lattice attraction and the long-range Coulomb repulsion between charge carriers could lead to the formation of short metallic [\cite=fedia1] [\cite=akpz] or insulating[\cite=akpz] [\cite=fedia2] stripes of polarons. If the attractive potential is isotropic, charged bubbles have a spherical shape. Kugel and Khomskii [\cite=klim] suggested recently that the anisotropic attraction forces caused by Jahn-Teller centers could lead to the phase segregation in the form of stripes. The long-range anisotropic attraction forces appear as the solution of the full set of elasticity equations (see ref.[\cite=eremin]). Alternative approach to take into account elasticity potentials was proposed in ref.[\cite=Shenoy] and is based on the proper consideration of compatibility constraint caused by absence of a dislocation in the solid.

Recently we formulated the model[\cite=mk] where we suggested that interaction of a two-fold degenerate electronic state with τ1 phonon modes at a finite wave-vector can lead to a local nonsymmetric deformation and short-length scale charge segregation. It was suggested [\cite=percolation] that this phase separation may lead to the insulator to superconductor phase transition governed by percolation. In this paper we reduce the proposed model to the lattice gas model and show that the model indeed displays phase separation, which may occur in the form of stripes or clusters depending on anisotropy of the short range attraction between localized carriers. We also generalize the model taking into account interaction of the Jahn-Teller centers via elasticity induced field.

We first derive a simplified lattice gas model. We show that the model without Coulomb repulsion displays a first order phase transition at a constant chemical potential. When the number of particles is fixed, the system is unstable with respect to the global phase separation below a certain critical temperature. In the presence of the Coulomb repulsion, global phase separation becomes unfavorable due to a large contribution to the energy from long range Coulomb interaction. The system shows mesoscopic phase separation where the size of charged regions is determined by the competition between the energy gain due to ordering and energy cost due to breaking of the local charge neutrality. Since the short range attraction is anisotropic the phase separation may be in the form of short segments or/and stripes.

Let us begin by considering a simplified version of the JT model Hamiltonian [\cite=mk], taking only the deformation of the B1g symmetry:

[formula]

here the Pauli matrix [formula] describes two components of the electronic doublet, and [formula] where f0(n) is a symmetric function describing the range of the interaction. For simplicity we omit the spin index in the sum. The model could be easily reduced to a lattice gas model. Let us introduce the classical variable [formula] and minimize the energy as a function of [formula] in the presence of the harmonic term [formula]. We obtain the deformation, which corresponds to the minimum of energy,

[formula]

Substituting [formula] into the Hamiltonian (1) and taking into account that the carriers are charged we arrive at the lattice gas model. We use a pseudospin operator S = 1 to describe the occupancies of the two electronic levels n1and n2. Here Sz = 1 corresponds to the state with n1 = 1 , n2 = 0, Szi =  - 1 to n1 = 0, n2 = 1 and Szi = 0 to n1 = n2 = 0. Simultaneous occupancy of both levels is excluded due to a high onsite Coulomb repulsion energy. The Hamiltonian in terms of the pseudospin operator is given by

[formula]

where [formula]. [formula] is the Coulomb potential, e is the charge of electron, ε0 is the static dielectric constant and a is the effective unit cell period. The anisotropic short range attraction potential is given by [formula]. The attraction in this model is generated by the interaction of electrons with optical phonons. The radius of the attraction force is determined by the radius of the electron-phonon interaction and the dispersion of the optical phonons[\cite=akpz].

A similar model can be formulated in the limit of continuous media. In this case the deformation is characterized by the components of the strain tensor. For the two dimensional case we can define 3 components of the strain tensor: e1 = uxx + uyy, ε = uxx - uyy and e2 = uxy transforming as the A1g, B1g and B2g representations of the D4h group respectively. These components of the tensor are coupled linearly with the two-fold degenerate electronic state which transforms as the Eg or Eu representation of the point group. Similarly to the case of previously considered interaction with optical phonons we keep the interaction with the deformation ε of the B1g symmetry only. The Hamiltonian without the Coulomb repulsion term has the form:

[formula]

where Aj are corresponding components of the elastic modulus tensor. The components of the strain tensor are not independent [\cite=Bishop] [\cite=Shenoy] and satisfy to the compatibility condition. The compatibility condition leads to a long range anisotropic interaction between polarons. The Hamiltonian in the reciprocal space has the form:

[formula]

The Fourrier transform of the potential is given by:

[formula]

By minimizing the energy with respect to εk and taking into account the long-range Coulomb repulsion we again derive Eq.(3). The anisotropic interaction potential [formula] is determined by the interaction with the classical deformation and is long-range. It decays as 1 / r2 at large distances in 2D. Since the attraction forces decay faster then the Coulomb repulsion forces at large distances the attraction can overcome the Coulomb repulsion at short distances, leading to a mesoscopic phase separation.

Irrespective of whether the resulting interaction between polarons is generated by acoustic or optical phonons the main physical picture remains the same. In both cases there is an anisotropic attraction between polarons on short distances. The interaction could be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic in terms of the pseudospin operators depending on mutual orientation of the orbitals. Without loosing generality we assume that [formula] is nonzero only for the nearest neighbors.

Our aim is to study the model (Eq.(3)) at constant average density,

[formula]

where Nis the total number of sites. However, to clarify the physical picture it is more appropriate to perform calculations with a fixed chemical potential first by adding the term [formula] to the Hamiltonian (3).

Models such as (3), but in the absence of the long-range forces, were studied many years ago on the basis of the molecular-field approximation in the Bragg-Williams formalism [\cite=lajz] [\cite=siva]. The mean-field equations for the particle density n and the pseudospin magnetization [formula] have the form[\cite=lajz]:

[formula]

here z = 4 is the number of the nearest neighbours for a square lattice in 2D and kB is the Boltzman constant. A phase transition to an ordered state with a finite M may be of either the first or the second order, depending on the value of μ. For μ > 0 it is always of the second order and n  →  1 as T  →  0. For the large negative values μ <  - 2zV1 the phase transition is absent and n  →  0 as T  →  0. For the physically important case - 2zV1  <  μ < 0 ordering occures as a result of the first order phase transition. Two solutions of Eqs.(8,9) with M = 0 and with finite M corresponds to two different minima of the free energy. The line of the phase transition is determined by the condition: F(M = 0,μ,T) = F(M,μ,T) where M is the solution of Eq. (8) (Fig.1)). When the number of particles is fixed (Eq.9) the system is unstable with respect to global phase separation below Tcrit. As a result at fixed average n two phases with n0 = n(M = 0,μ,T) and nM = n(M,μ,T) coexist.

To investigate further the properties of the system, we performed Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of the Hamiltonian Eq.(3). The simulations were performed on a square lattice with dimensions up to L  ×  L sites with 10  ≤  L  ≤  100 using a standard Metropolis algorithm[\cite=Metropolis53] in combination with simulated annealing[\cite=Kirkpatrick83].

First, for comparison with MF theory, the Monte-Carlo simulation of the model Eq.(3) in absence of the Coulomb forces shows the reduction of Tcrit due to fluctuations in 2D, by a factor of ~  2 (Fig.1).

Next we include the Coulomb interaction Vc(r). We use open boundary conditions to avoid complications due to the long range Coulomb forces and ensure global electroneutrality by adding an electrostatic potential due to the uniformly charged background [formula]  to (3), such that the Monte Carlo interaction becomes [formula], with the total background charge being equal in magnitude to the total charge of carriers, [formula], but with opposite sign. The dimensionless temperature t =  kBTε0a / e2, and the energy per particle are defined as eMC = HMCε0a / Ne2. The short range potential [formula] was taken to be nonzero only for [formula] and was therefore specified for nearest neighbours and next nearest neighbours as vl(1,0) and vl(1,1) respectively.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations could be summarized as follows. (i) Coulomb repulsion leads to further reduction of the onset temperature of phase separation (see Fig.1). (ii) Depending on the value of the attractive potential and its anisotropy phase separation takes place in the form of bubbles, horizontal and vertical or diagonal stripes (Fig.2). (iii) Depending on the anisotropy of the potential stripes (bubbles) are ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically orbitally ordered (Fig.2). (iv) The size of clusters is determined by the ratio of short range attraction and long-range Coulomb energy.

The results of the Monte-Carlo simulation of the model (3) allow general model independent interpretation. Let us consider the classical free energy density corresponding to the first order phase transition:

[formula]

Here t is dimensionless temperature. Let us assume that the order parameter Λ is coupled to the local charge density ρ, Fcoupl  =  α(Λ2  -  ρ)2. The total free energy density should contain the gradient term [formula] and electrostatic energy Fel = Kφρ as well. The electrostatic potential is determined from the Poisson equation ε0Δφ = 4πe(ρ  -  ρ0). Here we write ρ0 explicitly to take into account global electroneutrality. Substituting the solution of the Poisson equation to the electrostatic energy we obtain [formula], here V(k) = 1 / k. Minimization of F1 + Fcoupl + Fgrad + Fel at fixed t and ρ0 gives the spatial variation of the order parameter. The results of minimization are presented in Fig.3. As clearly seen from Fig.3 at low density phase separation takes place in the form of bubbles of optimal radius which are ordered. When density increases charge segregation appears in the form of charged domain walls.

Let us assume that a single bubble of the ordered phase with the radius R has appeared. As it was discussed in [\cite=mk] [\cite=gorkov2] the energy of the bubble is determined as: ε =  - FπR2  +  απR + γπR3, here F is the energy difference between two minima in the free energy, α is the surface energy, and γ determines the energy due local breaking of the charge neutrality. If α  <  πF / 3γ ε has well defined minimum. This minimum corresponds to optimal size of the cluster. Residual interactions leads to interbubble interactions and ordering of clusters at low temperatures.

We have demonstrated that anisotropic interaction between Jahn-Teller centers generated by optical and/or acoustical phonons leads to the short scale phase separation in the presence of the long range Coulomb repulsion. Topology of texturing differs from charged bobbles to oriented charged stripes depending on the anisotropy of short range potential.
