A note on recurrence sequences

Suppose that the sequence {uh} satisfies the relation

for some complex numbers [formula], [formula] and for [formula]. Taking h = 0 we see that un is in the ring [formula], by using the induction argument we show that all the terms in the sequence belong to this ring.

Let

[formula]

with distinct nonzero roots αi. It well known that there exist Ai(X) which are polynomials of degree ni - 1 for positive integers ni, i∈[1,m] such that

[formula]

for [formula], see for example [\cite=Mye], for an original work on recurrent sequences see [\cite=Mon]. More concretely, in this note we give a short proof of this result and the explicit formula {uh}.

Consider the vector space E of all sequences {vh} such that

[formula]

Remark that dim E = n and that [formula] for [formula], [formula] is a basis of E.

Define the projection [formula] for k  ≥  n by

[formula]

From the fact that  dim E = n we get the vectors Ψk({uh}), Ψk(ej,i), [formula], [formula] are linearly dependent, thus

[formula]

which gives

[formula]

with [formula], from the fact that [formula] for [formula], [formula] is a basis of E we get [formula] thus

[formula]

Also the (ordinary) generating function of the sequence {uh}, is given by

[formula]

with

[formula]

for 0  ≤  j  ≤  ni - 1 and 1  ≤  i  ≤  m. Of course the vectors are ordered in the same way in the two determinants.

Let I be finite subset of [formula] and define the projection [formula] by

[formula]

By using a similar argument as above we get the following theorem

Let I be a subset of n elements of [formula], let [formula], put [formula]. Then we have

[formula]

if [formula].

In the case m = n we have e0,i  =  {αhi} is a basis of E then we get following corollary

For all h we have

[formula]

Proof. Follows from the theorem by remarking that [formula], and det [ΨI(e0,i)1   ≤   i   ≤   m] is the Van der Mond determinant with m = n, when [formula]. And the equality is also true when h∈I, which achieve the proof.

In the next corollary gives uh as a function of an n fixed terms of the sequence {uh}

Let [formula] a sequence of positive integers. Then for all h we have

[formula]

when the expression has sense.

Proof. Similar to the proof of Corollary [\ref=recurrence].

>  rsolve(f(0)  =  1,f(1)  =  1,f(n)  =  f(n  -  1)  +  f(n  -  2),f(n)) gives the generale terms f(n) in Maple.
