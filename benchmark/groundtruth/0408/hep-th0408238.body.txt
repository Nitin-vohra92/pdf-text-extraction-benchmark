Introduction

In two-dimensional topological conformal field theory the following remarkable system of third order nonlinear partial differential equations for a function F of N variables emerged [\cite=WITT:1991],[\cite=DIJK-VERL-VERL:1991]

[formula]

Here Fi is the matrix

[formula]

Roughly speaking, this system expresses the conditions on a function whose third order derivatives form the structure constants of an associative, commutative algebra. Moreover, it is required that F1 is a constant and invertible matrix. Usually this system is called the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (WDVV) equations. Generalizations, not requiring F1 to be constant, have been introduced and studied in the context of four- and five-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory (see e.g. [\cite=MARS-MIRO-MORO:1996] [\cite=MARS-MIRO-MORO:2000], [\cite=HOEV-MART2:2003].

Although extremely difficult to solve in general, this overdetermined system ([\ref=eq1]) of nonlinear partial differential equations admits exact solutions. For instance, within the theory of Frobenius manifolds, a substantial class of polynomial solutions has been constructed by Dubrovin [\cite=DUBR:1996] for any Coxeter group. Furthermore, for any gauge group, perturbative approximations to exact prepotentials in four-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory satisfy the (generalized) WDVV equations. These solutions are of logarithmic type and may be constructed for any root system (see [\cite=MARS-MIRO-MORO:1996] and [\cite=MART-GRAG:1999]). The corresponding five-dimensional theories give rise to trigonometric solutions, see e.g. [\cite=NEKR:1998],[\cite=HOEV-MART2:2003].

Inspired by the paper [\cite=BRAD-MARS:2002] we construct second order reductions of the (third order) WDVV system, related to the logarithmic solutions associated with classical Lie algebras. In [\cite=BRAD-MARS:2002], the authors' main result is a form of the WDVV equations resembling a cocycle condition

[formula]

where T is the Hesse matrix of a function F(x1,...,xN). The main idea is to perform a change of variables from xk to a single row [formula] of the Hesse matrix. All other elements of the Hesse matrix are functionally dependent on that row and the authors then show that the equations ([\ref=braden_marshakov]) are equivalent to the generalized WDVV system.

In fact, Braden and Marshakov go on to construct a second order reduction of the WDVV equations by studying the relations among the elements of the Hessian of the prepotential of type A3. In this paper, we modify and largely extend the construction of such reductions to all Lie algebras of classical type in section [\ref=section_reductions]. Finally, we discuss the effect of changes of the ultraviolet cut-off on the reductions in section [\ref=section_Lambda].

Second order reductions for classical Lie algebras

For any rank N root system R with positive roots R+, we consider the following function

[formula]

where [formula] is a linear combination of basis vectors vi of the root space, and (.,.) denotes the Euclidean inner product. Such functions are known as pure perturbative four-dimensional Seiberg-Witten prepotentials in the physics literature [\cite=SEIB-WITT1:1994] [\cite=KLEM-LERC-YANK-THEI:1995], where they occur in the study of quantum Yang-Mills theories. The parameter Λ occurs in the Seiberg-Witten theory as an energy cut-off scale, and is irrelevant for the WDVV equations since it has no effect on the third order derivatives of F. The reductions we propose here are of second order, but as we will show in section [\ref=section_Lambda] they turn out also to be independent of the value of Λ.

The reduction for type A prepotentials

Naturally, the explicit form of the prepotential depends on the chosen basis {vi}. Although this choice is usually irrelevant since linear transformations are symmetries of the WDVV equations, we will be dealing with second order reductions on which the choice may have an influence. The choice we make here leads to the well-known type A Seiberg-Witten prepotential

[formula]

For convenience we set [formula], after which the second order derivatives Tij of F are given by

[formula]

These second order derivatives satisfy the following set of relations

[formula]

These relations are somewhat reminiscent of those occurring in Hirota's work on tau functions of integrable hierarchies [\cite=BRAD-MARS:2002], [\cite=ZABR:1997].

Starting from the relations ([\ref=relaties1]),([\ref=relaties2]) one sees that the elements Tij of the Hesse matrix T can be expressed in terms of a single row [formula] for fixed a as follows

[formula]

and

[formula]

In general no relations exist between the Tak and they can be taken as independent.

The relations ([\ref=relaties1]),([\ref=relaties2]) form a second order reduction of the WDVV equations in the sense that any function G(z1,...,zN) whose second order derivatives Tij satisfy the reduction, automatically satisfies the WDVV equations.

Having a function G(z) satisfying the reduction, we use the equations

[formula]

to introduce the objects xi(z). We already know from the study of the prepotential ([\ref=prepotential_A]) that these equations are compatible with the reduction. Moreover it is easily seen that ([\ref=introductie_x]) can be used to define the xi uniquely. Since the objects [formula] are totally symmetric, the Tij can be integrated twice with respect to the xi (not the zi) to obtain the known prepotential ([\ref=prepotential_A]). We now have two functions, the well-known F(x) and the unknown G(z), whose second order derivatives are equal [formula]. As shown in [\cite=MIRO-MORO:1998], due to this relation between the second order derivatives the unknown function G(z) satisfies the WDVV equations since the prepotential F does.

The reduction for the remaining classical Lie algebras

The roots in [formula] of the remaining classical Lie algebras are given in table [\ref=table_BCD]. Taking the standard Euclidean basis, the corresponding prepotentials are

[formula]

with η,ζ as in table [\ref=table_BCD]. Chosing [formula], one finds

[formula]

From these values of the second order derivatives of the prepotential one can derive the following relations among them

[formula]

We therefore have the following result

The relations ([\ref=relaties3]),([\ref=relaties4]) form a second order reduction of the WDVV equations in the sense that any function G(z1,...,zN) whose second order derivatives Tij satisfy the reduction, also satisfies the WDVV equations.

The proof follows the same lines as the proof of proposition [\ref=prop_A_type].

The role of Λ

The parameter Λ plays the role of the energy cut-off in Seiberg-Witten theory. Changing this parameter amounts to adding a second order polynomial to the prepotential, which is clearly a symmetry of the third order WDVV equations. The reductions proposed in this paper are of second order, and so the value of Λ can in principal make a difference. We will show however that this is not the case.

Adding a second order polynomial preserves the solution set of the reduction (),() iff the polynomial is a multiple of [formula]. Similarly, addition of a second order polynomial preserves the solution set of the reduction (),() iff it is of the form [formula] with arbitrary integer n and arbitrary parameter ξ.

Adding a polynomial [formula] to a generic solution of the type AN reduction, one finds that ([\ref=relaties1]) restricts aij = c for i  ≠  j and some common constant c. Then it is clear that ([\ref=relaties2]) restricts aii =  - Nc. This leads to the assertion of the lemma regarding the type A reduction. Similarly ([\ref=relaties3]) restricts the polynomial to [formula], and ([\ref=relaties4]) restricts the aii further.

A change Λ  →  e- 2ξΛ in ([\ref=prepotential_A]) leads to an addition of a term [formula] which is a symmetry of the type A reduction. Similarly, a change [formula] in ([\ref=prepotential_BCD]) gives an additional term [formula] which in turn is a symmetry of the BCD reduction.

Remarks

The generalized WDVV equations are known to be invariant under the following two types of transformations [\cite=DUBR:1996] [\cite=MARS-WIT:2001]: linear transformations of the coordinates and so-called duality transformations. The duality transformations comprise a group of contact symmetries acting as constant symplectic transformations on a vector containing the coordinates xi as one half of its indices and the first order derivatives Fi of the prepotential as the other half. It is readily observed that the reductions ([\ref=relaties1]), ([\ref=relaties2]) and ([\ref=relaties3]), ([\ref=relaties4]) are not invariant under general linear coordinate changes nor general symplectic transformations. This implies among other things that the choice of basis in the root space is relevant for the reduction one obtains.

A purpose of having a reduction might be to see if it can be easily solved, thus gaining new solutions to the WDVV equations. As shown above, the solutions of the reductions consist of the functions G(z) whose Hesse matrix equals that of the perturbative prepotentials F(x) for classical Lie algebras: [formula]. Since this type of relation between two prepotentials was already studied in the literature (see e.g. [\cite=MIRO-MORO:1998]) the reduction does not yield new information in this sense.
