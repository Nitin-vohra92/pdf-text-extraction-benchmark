Neutrino self-polarization effect in matter

Moscow State University, Department of Theoretical physics, 119992 Moscow, Russia

Convincing evidence in favour of non-zero neutrino mass that has been obtained during the last few years in atmospheric and solar-neutrino experiments, are also confirming in the reactor KamLAND and long-baseline accelerator experiments (see [\cite=Bil04] for a review on the present status of neutrino mixing and oscillations). Even within the standard model (minimally extended with SU(2) - singlet right-handed neutrino) a massive neutrino inevitably has non-zero magnetic moment μ generated by the one-loop diagramme [\cite=FujShr80]. A recent studies of a massive neutrino electromagnetic properties within one-loop level, including discussion on the neutrino magnetic moment, can be found in [\cite=DvoStuPRD04]. It should be also noted here that a rather detailed discussion on the neutrino charge radius is presented in the two recent papers [\cite=BerPapBin0405288] [\cite=FujShrPRD04].

In a series of our papers [\cite=LikStu95] [\cite=EgoLobStuPLB00] [\cite=LobStuPLB01] [\cite=DvoStuJHEP02] [\cite=LobStuPLB03] [\cite=DvoGriStu04] we have developed the Lorentz invariant approach to neutrino oscillations which enables us to study, in particular, the neutrino spin procession in the background matter with effects of the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational fields being also accounted for. A review on these our studies can be found in [\cite=StuYF04Stu0407010].

In [\cite=LobStuPLB03] [\cite=DvoGriStu04] we have predicted the new mechanism of electromagnetic radiation by neutrino moving in background matter and/or electromagnetic and gravitational fields. We have named this radiation as "spin light of neutrino" and introduced the abbreviation SLν which we shall use below in this paper. The SLν originates from the neutrino spin precession that can be induced whether by weak interactions of neutrino with the background matter or by the external electromagnetic or gravitational fields that could be present in the background environment. It should be noted that the discussed mechanism of electromagnetic radiation by a neutrino moving in a constant magnetic field was also studied previously in [\cite=BorZhuTer88].

As we have shown in [\cite=LobStuPLB03], the total power of the SLν in matter does not washed out when the emitted photon refractive index is equal to unit and the SLν can not be considered as the neutrino Cerenkov radiation (see, for example, [\cite=IoaRaf97] and references therein). It was also emphasized [\cite=LobStuPLB03] that the initially unpolarized neutrino beam (equal mixture of active left-handed and sterile right-handed neutrinos) can be converted to the totally polarized beam composed of only νR due to the spin light in contrast to the Cherenkov radiation which can not produce the neutrino spin self-polarization effect.

The discovered important properties of SLν (such as strong beaming of the radiation along the neutrino momentum, the rapid growth of the total radiation power with the neutrino energy and density of matter, the possibility to emit photons with energies span up to gamma-rays) enables us to predict that this radiation should be important in different astrophysical environments (quasars, gamma-ray bursts etc) and in dense plasma of the early Universe.

In this paper we should like to present a detailed study of the neutrino spin self-polarization effect in matter which has been recently predicted in our previous paper [\cite=LobStuPLB03]. In [\cite=LobStuPLB03] we considered the SLν in matter in the case of unpolarized neutrinos. In the present paper we make a reasonable step forward and study the SLν in matter accounting for the neutrinos polarization. It is sufficient that the SLν in matter (as the similar radiation by neutrinos moving in the magnetic field [\cite=BorZhuTer88]) originates from the spin-flip transitions νL  →  νR. Within the quantum approach the corresponding Feynman diagram of the proposed new process is the standard one-photon emission diagram with the initial and final neutrino states described by the "broad lines" that account for the neutrino interaction with matter. We show below how derive the transition rate of the polarized neutrinos using the quasi-classical method [\cite=Lob03] for description of spin wave functions in the presence of an electromagnetic field, given by the tensor Fμν, and apply it for the case when a massive neutrino with non-zero magnetic moment is moving and radiating the spin light in the background matter.

As it has been shown [\cite=EgoLobStuPLB00], the quasi-classical Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation [\cite=BarMicTelPRL59], describing a neutral particle spin evolution under the influence of an electromagnetic field, can be generalized for the case of a neutrino moving in electromagnetic fields and matter by implementing the substitution of the external electromagnetic field tensor, [formula], according to the prescription

[formula]

where the anti-symmetric tensor [formula] describes the neutrino interaction with the background matter. We have also shown [\cite=LobStuPLB01] how to construct the tensor Gμν with use of the neutrino speed, matter speed, and matter polarization four-vectors. It worth to note that the substitution ([\ref=presc]) implies that the magnetic [formula] and electric [formula] fields are shifted by the vectors [formula] and [formula], respectively:

[formula]

From the new generalized BMT equation for the neutrino spin evolution in an electromagnetic field and matter we have finally derive the following equation for the evolution of the three-dimensional neutrino spin vector [formula] (see [\cite=LobStuPLB01] [\cite=LobStuPLB03]):

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

where t is time in the laboratory frame, β is the neutrino speed, [formula] and [formula] ([formula]) are transversal and longitudinal (with respect to the direction [formula] of neutrino motion) electromagnetic field components in the laboratory frame. For simplify we neglect here the neutrino electric dipole moment, ε = 0, and also consider the case when matter is composed of only one type of fermions (which we chose to be electrons for definiteness). Here [formula] is the invariant number density of matter given in the reference frame for which the total speed of matter is zero. The vectors [formula], and [formula] denote, respectively, the speed of the reference frame in which the mean momentum of matter (electrons) is zero, and the mean value of the polarization vector of the background electrons in the above mentioned reference frame. The coefficients ρ(1,2)e are calculated if the neutrino Lagrangian is given, and within the extended standard model supplied with SU(2)-singlet right-handed neutrino νR,

[formula]

where F  =  GF(1 + 4 sin 2θW).

Our observation [\cite=EgoLobStuPLB00] [\cite=LobStuPLB01] that the neutrino spin evolution in the presence of matter can be described by the generalized BMT equation with the substitutions given by eqs.([\ref=presc]) and ([\ref=11]) make it possible to use the quasi-classical approach (developed in [\cite=Lob03] for the case of a neutral particle spin evolution in electromagnetic fields) for the study of the neutrino spin-polarization effect in matter. Here below we suppose that the effect of an external electromagnetic field (if any is present in the background environment) can be neglected in comparison with the effect of the neutrino interaction with the background matter. Then, the equation for the neutrino quasi-classical spin wave function Ψ(τ) is

[formula]

where τ is the neutrino proper time and we use the notation û  =  γμuμ, where [formula] If for simplicity we neglect effects of the neutrino electric dipole moment (ε = 0) and consider unpolarized matter composed of electrons, then we have[\cite=LobStuPLB03]

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the electron current, [formula] is the speed of matter (the average speed of the electrons), and we use the notation [formula]. In the case of non-moving matter that will be also considered below, for the tensor Gμν we get

[formula]

To derive the total transition probability of the neutrino spin light radiation in matter we define the density matrix of partially polarized neutrino in the form,

[formula]

where p(τ0) is the neutrino initial momentum, U(τ,τ0) is the neutrino spin evolution operator correspondent to the equation ([\ref=spin_eq]). For the pure state the density matrix reduces to direct product of bispinors, normalized by the condition [formula]

The total transition probability of the neutrino spin light radiation in matter is

[formula]

Here ϱi(x,y;p),  ϱf(y,x;q) are density matrices of the initial, i, and final, f, neutrino states,   ϱμνph(x,y;k) is the density matrix of the emitted photon, [formula] is the vertex function, [formula].

In order to transit to the quasi-classical approximation, it is necessary to substitute precise density matrices for once of ([\ref=rho]) and to neglect the recoil in the photon radiation process.

After calculations similar to that performed in [\cite=Lob03] for the case of a neutral fermion transition under the influence of an electromagnetic field, we get the quasi-classical expression for the neutrino total transition probability in matter,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

Integrations in eq.([\ref=P_1]) are performed over the solid angle Ω and energy k of the photon, and the proper times τ and τ' of neutrino. The four-dimensional vector [formula] is fixed by the three-dimensional unit vector [formula] that points the direction of radiation.

Performing integration over angular variables, we get from ([\ref=P_1]) the neutrino transition probability in the form

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let us consider a neutrino propagating in matter composed of unpolarized electrons. In this case the tensor Gμν is given by ([\ref=G]). Then the neutrino spin evolution operator U(τ) correspondent to the equation ([\ref=spin_eq]) is

[formula]

where

[formula]

is the four-dimensional vector determining the axis of the total neutrino spin self-polarization. The neutrino spin precession frequency ω is determined by the neutrino speed vector uα and the tensor Gμν:

[formula]

In the case of moving and unpolarized matter composed of electrons we have from eqs.([\ref=G]) and ([\ref=j]) that

[formula]

Note that the latter expression for the frequency ω in the case of non-moving matter is in agreement with the estimation of ref.[\cite=LobStuPLB03] for the neutrino spin light photon energy

[formula]

in the laboratory reference frame.

From the previous discussion it is evident that the neutrino spin polarization axis in the rest frame of the neutrino is given by the vector 0 (see eqs.([\ref=M_0]),([\ref=M_0_parallel]) and ([\ref=M_0_perp])). It follows from ([\ref=S_tp]) that in the case of unpolarized and non-moving matter the direction of the neutrino spin polarization coincides with the direction of the neutrino speed,

[formula]

The neutrino spin light radiation leads to the total spin polarization in the direction of the neutrino motion, i.e. initially left-handed polarized neutrinos are converted to the right-handed polarized neutrinos,

[formula]

From ([\ref=P_2]) we get that the neutrino transition rate (the probability per unite time) from νL to νR state is

[formula]

whereas the rate of the transition νR  →  νL is zero,

[formula]

It should be noted here that eqs. ([\ref=Gamma_L_R]) and ([\ref=Gamma_R_L]) with ω determined by ([\ref=omega]) reproduce the neutrino transition rates for the unpolarized background matter of arbitrary particles composition moving with arbitrary common speed if the appropriate form (see in [\cite=LobStuPLB01]) of the tensor Gμν is chosen. If matter is not moving and composed of only electrons then from eqs. ([\ref=rho]), ([\ref=omega]), ([\ref=omega_1]) and ([\ref=Gamma_L_R]) we get

[formula]

and, obviously, the rate of the transition νR  →  νL is again zero. The obtained result ([\ref=Gamma_L_R_1]) exceeds the value of the neutrino spin light rate derived in [\cite=LobStuPLB03] by a factor of two because it gives the emission rate of the totaly polarized left-handed neutrinos νL, whereas the corresponding rate of ref.[\cite=LobStuPLB03] was derived under the assumption that neutrinos in the initial state were not polarized.

For the ultra relativistic neutrino (that is the most interesting case for different astrophysical and cosmology applications) interactions of the right-handed polarized neutrinos, νR, with the background particles is suppressed with respect to interactions of the left-handed polarized neutrinos, νL, by the factor of ~  γ- 1. Therefore, we conclude that, in fact, the "spin light of neutrino" in matter leads to the neutrino conversion from active to sterile states. As it follows from the above discussion, the rate of the "spin light of neutrino" significantly depends on the density of the background matter. That is why the considered neutrino self-polarization effect is expected to be important at the early stages of evolution of the Universe.
