Introduction

Determinant and Pfaffian identities play a key role in combinatorics and the representation theory (see, for example, [\cite=IOW], [\cite=IW1], [\cite=IW2], [\cite=Kr], [\cite=O1], [\cite=O2]). Among such determinant identities, the central ones are Cauchy's determinant identities ([\cite=C]) C. W. Borchardt [\cite=B] gave a generalization of Cauchy's identities: Here [formula] is the permanent of a square matrix A defined by

[formula]

This identity ([\ref=borch1]) is used when we evaluate the determinants appearing in the 0-enumeration of alternating sign matrices (see [\cite=O2]).

I. Schur [\cite=S] gave a Pfaffian analogue of Cauchy's identity ([\ref=cauchy1]) in his study of projective representations of the symmetric groups. Schur's Pfaffian identity and its variant ([\cite=LLT], [\cite=St]) are

In this note, we give identities which can be regarded as Pfaffian analogues of Borchardt's identities ([\ref=borch1]), ([\ref=borch2]) and as generalizations of Schur's identities ([\ref=schur1]), ([\ref=schur2]).

Let n be a positive integer. Then we have

Here [formula] denotes the Hafnian of a symmetric matrix A defined by

[formula]

where F2n is the set of all permutations σ satisfying [formula] and σ(2i - 1)  <  σ(2i) for 1  ≤  i  ≤  n.

Proof

In this section, we prove the identity ([\ref=main1]) in Theorem [\ref=main-theorem] by using the complex analysis. The other identity ([\ref=main2]) is shown by the same method, and also derived from more general identity ([\ref=main3]) in Theorem [\ref=general2], which follows from ([\ref=main1]). So we omit the proof of ([\ref=main2]) here.

Hereafter we put

[formula]

For an 2n  ×  2n symmetric (or skew-symmetric) matrix M  =  (mij) and distinct indices [formula], we denote by [formula] the (2n - r)  ×  (2n - r) matrix obtained by removing the rows and columns indexed by [formula].

First we show two lemmas by using the complex analysis.

[formula]

If n is a positive integer, then

[formula]

Now we are in the position to prove the identity ([\ref=main1]) in Theorem [\ref=main-theorem].

Generalization

The Cauchy's identities ([\ref=cauchy1]) and ([\ref=cauchy2]), and the Borchardt's identities ([\ref=borch1]) and ([\ref=borch2]) are respectively unified in the following form.

Let f(x,y)  =  axy  +  bx  +  cy  +  d be a nonzero polynomial. Then we have

[formula]

Similarly we can generalize the Schur's identities ([\ref=schur1]) and ([\ref=schur2]), and our identities ([\ref=main1]) and ([\ref=main2]).

Let g(x,y)  =  axy  +  b(x  +  y)  +  c be a nonzero polynomial. Then we have

[formula]

This generalization ([\ref=schur3]) is given in [\cite=Kn].

From ([\ref=cauchy3]) and ([\ref=borch3]), we have

[formula]

Since the matrix [formula] has rank at most 2, this identity is the special case of the following theorem.

(Carlitz and Levine [\cite=CL]) Let A  =  (aij) be a matrix of rank at most 2. If aij  ≠  0 for all i and j, we have

[formula]

From ([\ref=schur3]) and ([\ref=main3]), we have

[formula]

It is a natural problem to find a Pfaffian-Hafnian analogue of Theorem [\ref=carlitz]. Also it is interesting to find more examples of a skew-symmetric matrix X and a symmetric matrix Y satisfying

[formula]

Recently there appeared a bijective proof of Borchardt's identity (see [\cite=Si]). It will be an interesting problem to give a bijective proof of and .
