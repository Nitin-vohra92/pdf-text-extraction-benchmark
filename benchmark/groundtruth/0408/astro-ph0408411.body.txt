Quiescent Dense Gas in Protostellar Clusters: the Ophiuchus A Core

Introduction

The numbers of embedded clusters observed in giant molecular clouds and the inferred birthrates of their stellar populations suggest strongly that stars in the Galaxy form predominantly within clustered environments and not in isolation (Lada & Lada 2003). At present, however, no paradigm exists describing how stellar formation proceeds within clusters inside turbulent cloud cores (Meyer et al. 2000). Such cores can contain starless objects, i.e., local maxima of arbitrarily high column density where no evidence for star formation has been detected, as well as extremely young protostellar objects, i.e., locations where evidence for star formation has been detected. Observations of these objects in clusters should significantly improve our understanding of how they form. The gas and dust comprising or surrounding these objects can reveal the motions and physical conditions associated with the earliest stages of stellar formation, providing the necessary constraints to new models.

The Ophiuchus star-forming molecular cloud is particularly well suited for an intensive study of the dense gas associated with star formation within clusters. Only 125 pc distant (de Geus, de Zeeuw, & Lub 1989, de Geus 1992), Ophiuchus contains the nearest embedded cluster to the Sun (see Allen et al. 2002, and references therein), residing within high column densities of gas and dust (e.g., see Loren, Wootten, & Wilking 1990; LWW90). Therefore, appropriate observations of Ophiuchus can reveal starless objects and extremely young protostellar objects within a clustered environment at the best possible sensitivities and the finest possible linear resolutions.

Over the last decade, observations of the cores associated with L1688 in Ophiuchus, i.e., Oph A to Oph F (see LWW90), have revealed numerous potential starless and extremely young protostellar objects. In particular, the Oph A core contains a protostellar cluster including the prototypical "Class 0" object, VLA 1623, in addition to starless objects to its north and east named SM1N, SM1, and SM2 (see André, Ward-Thompson, & Barsony 1993; AWB93). Wide-field 1.3 mm continuum maps by Motte, André, & Neri (1998; MAN98) revealed Oph A is the brightest of the Oph cores, and a multiresolution wavelet analysis of its emission suggested the presence of eight other starless objects in Oph A. The objects A-MM6, A-MM7, and A-MM8, together with SM1N, SM1, and SM2, comprise an arc within the filamentary structure of Oph A centered on the nearby B star S1 (see Figure 2a of MAN98). MAN98 also found the starless objects in the Oph cores have a mass spectrum reminiscent of the stellar IMF, suggesting a link exists between the formation of these objects and actual stars in clusters.

In this paper, we examine emission from dense gas associated with the Oph A core, using combined single-dish and interferometer data to attain a linear resolution of ~  1000 AU. We observed the 1-0 transition of the N2H+ molecular ion since it is a tracer of dense gas (e.g., its critical density for excitation is ncr = 2 ×   105 cm- 3) and N2H+ may deplete significantly only at densities [formula]105 cm- 3 (see Bergin & Langer 1997, Bergin et al. 2002). Only two of the five maxima of integrated line intensity found are coincident with peaks of millimeter continuum emission from dust. In addition, several peaks of dust emission are not coincident with maxima of integrated line intensity. This situation is different from that seen in isolated cores where coincidence between dust and N2H+ emission is common. The difference is likely due to variations in N2H+ abundance within Oph A arising from differences in the relative density and dust temperature within each object. Focusing on the line emission alone, we find that its widths vary by a factor of ~  5 in Oph A, with several locations having FWHMs <   0.3 km s- 1. The centroid velocities of the line emission vary little in Oph A, however, having an rms of only ~  0.17 km s- 1. Small-scale centroid velocity gradients are found near the SM1, SM1N, and SM2 objects. The quiescent and slow motions of objects in Oph A objects contrast sharply with the turblent and dynamic motions expected in some models of cluster formation. One integrated line intensity maximum, Oph A-N6, has line widths as low as 0.193 km s- 1 FWHM, or just larger than the line width expected from thermal motions alone, indicating localized reduction of turbulent motions within Oph A.

Details of our observations are described in § 2. We present the results in § 3, including derivations of N2H+ column densities and H2 column densities, and descriptions of the widths, centroids, and profiles of the N2H+ 1-0 line across Oph A. A discussion of the implications of our data is found in § 4, and we summarize our conclusions in § 5.

Observations

IRAM 30 m Telescope Observations

Observations of the Oph A core at the 93.17 GHz frequency of N2H+ 1-0, consisting of 7 hyperfine components over 4.6 MHz (see Caselli, Myers, & Thaddeus 1995; CMT95), were carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta, Spain. Data were obtained during three clear nights between 1998 June 25 and 1998 June 28, in association with a comprehensive molecular line study of the cores and condensations of the Ophiuchus protostellar cluster (Belloche et al. 2001; André et al. 2004, in preparation) Data were taken in the "on-the-fly" mapping mode (Ungerechts et al. 2000), with an individual dump time of 2 seconds, a scanning speed of 1[formula] s- 1, and a spacing of 5[formula] between consecutive scans. The reference position was taken at the location of the B3 star S1 (see Figure 1) which had previously been seen to be free of emission in any dense gas tracer such as N2H+ 1-0. The half-power beam width of the telescope was ~  26[formula]. An SIS heterodyne receiver was used with an autocorrelator as backend to give a spectral resolution of 19.5 kHz over 17.5 MHz. The corresponding spectral resolution was 0.06284 km s- 1.

The observations were done in single sideband mode, with a sideband rejection of 0.003 and an associated calibration uncertainty of ~  10%. The forward and beam efficiencies of the telescope used to convert antenna temperatures [formula] into main beam temperatures [formula] were 92% and 73%, respectively. The system temperature ranged from ~  170 K to ~  200 K on the [formula] scale. The telescope pointing was checked every ~  2 hours on the strong radio sources NRAO 530 or 1514-241 and found to be accurate to better than ~  5[formula] (i.e, the maximum deviation between two consecutive pointings). The telescope focus, optimized on the same sources every ~  3-4 hours, was very stable. The data cube was produced and reduced with the CLASS software package (Buisson et al. 2002).

BIMA Millimeter Array Observations

The Oph A core was observed with the BIMA Millimeter Array located at Hat Creek, California, U.S.A., over 2 tracks in its C-configuration (1999 May 04, 23) and 2 tracks in its B-configuration (2000 March 14, 15). A total of 3 pointings was observed along the bright continuum filament associated with the A core detected by MAN98. The pointings were spaced by ~  1, slightly less than required for Nyquist sampling, for a constant rms noise level along the filament. Each track consisted of cycled visits to the Oph A pointings interspersed with observations of radio sources 1625-254 (in 1999) or 1733-130 (in 2000) approximately every 20 minutes for phase calibration. Flux calibration was obtained from observations of 3C 273 and Neptune at the beginning and the end of each track respectively.

Data reduction was performed using standard tasks in the MIRIAD software package (see Sault, Teuben & Wright 1995). Quasar data were self-calibrated using fluxes bootstrapped from Neptune data, and the resulting amplitude and phase solutions were applied to the target pointings. All 3 pointings were inverted simultaneously, and the resulting mosaics were deconvolved with a cleaning algorithm based on that presented by Steer, Dewdney, & Ito (1984). The N2H+ 1-0 data were convolved with a Gaussian of 5 ×   0 FWHM (P.A. = 90[formula]) to improve the beam shape and increase brightness sensitivity. The final synthesized beam size was 9 ×   6 FWHM (and P.A. = -13.18[formula]), corresponding to a linear FWHM resolution of 0.0060 pc ×   0.0037 pc at the 125 pc distance to Oph A.

Combining the Datasets

The BIMA and IRAM data of N2H+ 1-0 were combined to recover missing flux from extended structure resolved out in the interferometer map. The IRAM data were regridded in velocity from 0.06284 km s- 1 channels to 0.07854 km s- 1 channels to match the velocity resolution of the BIMA data. The MIRIAD task immerge was used for the combination, where the sum of the Fourier transforms of the clean BIMA and IRAM images is itself transformed into the image plane as the combined image. To ensure a common flux scale for the independent datasets prior to combination, visibilities of both were compared over 2-9 kλ, the maximum range of spatial frequencies in common, and a derived scaling factor of 1.11 was applied to the IRAM data. Comparing the total flux of the combined dataset convolved to a ~  27[formula] FWHM beam with that of the IRAM data, we estimate this method recovers 85% of the flux in the latter map over the region of interest.

Results

Figure 1a shows the 1.3 mm continuum emission from Oph A detected by MAN98 using the IRAM 30 m Telescope at 13[formula] FWHM resolution. Figure 1b shows the integrated intensity of N2H+ 1-0 line emission detected by us over the same region, using combined data from the IRAM 30 m Telescope and the BIMA millimeter interferometer at ~  10[formula] ×   ~  6[formula]  FHWM resolution. The line emission from Oph A shows a filamentary structure similar to that shown by the continuum emission, although the width of the the integrated line emission structure is narrower than that of the continuum emission. Figure 1a shows positions of several objects in Oph A identified by MAN98 from their multiresolution wavelet analysis. Figure 1b shows these positions again as well as the positions of the various maxima of integrated intensity of N2H+ 1-0, which we have named here Oph A-N1 through N6 and whose positions are listed in Table 1. Some, but not complete, coincidence is seen between continuum objects and the maxima of integrated line intensity in Oph A. For example, SM1 and SM1N are coincident (within a beam FWHM) of N4 and N5 respectively (and possibly A-MM5 with N2 also). Some Oph A continuum objects, however, have little-to-no detected N2H+ 1-0 emission associated with them. For example, relatively little line emission is found at the positions of VLA 1623, SM2, A-MM6, A-MM7, and A-MM8. Furthermore, some maxima of the N2H+ 1-0 integrated intensity in Oph A, although coincident with extended continuum emission, are not associated with continuum objects. For example, N1, N3, and N6 are not associated with objects specifically identified by MAN98. The lack of coincidence between peaks of dust emission and maxima of N2H+ emission in Oph A is very different from the high level of coincidence between the two tracers seen in numerous isolated cores, albeit at lower resolution (e.g., Tafalla et al. 2002).

All 7 hyperfine components of the N2H+ 1-0 line from the combined data were fit simultaneously using the HFS (HyperFine Structure) fitting routine of the CLASS data analysis package (see Buisson et al.) For each 0 ×   0 pixel of the data cube, these fits provided estimates of: 1) ΔV, the line FWHM, 2) VLSR, the centroid velocity, 3) τtot, the sum of peak optical depths for all 7 hyperfine components, and 4) (Jex-Jbg)τtot, the difference between the (Rayleigh-Jeans equivalent) excitation and background temperatures times τtot. (In the latter, Jex = (hν / k)/(exp(hν / kTex)-1), Jbg = (hν / k)/(exp(hν / kTbg)-1), and Tex and Tbg are the actual excitation and background temperatures respectively.) The brightness temperature of the 1-0 line, TB, can be estimated from

[formula]

Table 2 lists the mean, rms, minimum and maximum values of ΔV, VLSR, TB and τtot from the combined data after averaging them into 10 ×   6 pixels, i.e., pixels with areas slightly larger than those of the synthesized beam. Most notably, ΔV in Oph A varies widely but VLSR does not. For example, ΔV varies by a factor of ~  5 in Oph A but the rms of VLSR is only 0.17 km s- 1.

In the following, we describe the N2H+ data in more detail, using the results obtained by HFS fitting to examine the N2H+ column densities and abundances as well as the widths and centroid velocities of the N2H+ 1-0 line.

Column Densities and Abundances

Column densities of H2, i.e., N(H2), can be determined in Oph A with the 1.3 mm continuum data of MAN98 (e.g., see Figure 1a) from

[formula]

where Sν is the 1.3 mm flux density, Ωm is the main-beam solid angle, μ is the mean molecular weight, mH is the mass of atomic hydrogen, κν is the dust opacity per unit mass at 1.3 mm (assumed to be 0.005 cm2 g- 1 for starless objects by MAN98; the local gas-to-dust ratio is assumed to be 100), and Bν(Tdust) is the Planck function at T = Tdust.

Figure 2a shows N(H2) in Oph A obtained by assuming Tdust = 20 K at all locations (following MAN98). To facilitate comparision with the N2H+ data, the area shown is restricted to that where the peak brightness temperature of the brightest hyperfine component, TmaxB ≥   3 σ in the N2H+ 1-0 line data. Furthermore, the MAN98 continuum data were binned into pixels 10 ×   6 in size using standard image interpolation methods in MIRIAD to obtain pixels with areas approximately that of the beam of the N2H+ observations. (Note that each pixel in Figure 2a is still not spatially independent of its neighbors.) Figure 2a shows the N(H2) distribution across Oph A is similar to that of the 1.3 mm continuum emission shown in Figure 1a, due of course to the linear proportionality between the two quantities in Equation 2 if Tdust is constant. Table 3 lists the mean, rms, minimum, and maximum of N(H2) shown in Figure 2a.

Column densities of N2H+, i.e., N(N2H+), can be determined along the Oph A filament from the line characteristics obtained from HFS fitting (see § 3). Assuming LTE, i.e., all level populations are described by a single excitation temperature, Tex, N(N2H+) can be found following Womack, Ziurys, & Wyckoff (1992) from

[formula]

where ΔV and τtot are found from HFS fits to data averaged to 10 ×   6 pixels. In addition, J is the lower rotational level number (i.e., 0), μe is the dipole moment of the N2H+ molecular ion (i.e., 3.40 Debye; Green, Montgomery & Thaddeus 1974), B is the rotational constant of N2H+ (i.e., 46.586702 GHz; see CMT95) and EJ is the energy above ground of the lower rotational level (i.e., 0).

Figure 2b shows N(N2H+) in Oph A obtained using the results of our HFS fits and Equation 3. Figure 2b shows the N(N2H+) distribution across Oph A is not similar to the N(H2) distribution, but rather is similar to that of the N2H+ integrated intensities shown in Figure 1b. Table 3 lists the mean, rms, minimum, and maximum of N(N2H+) shown in Figure 2b. We note that assuming LTE in Oph A can result in overestimates of N(N2H+) from N2H+ 1-0 emission toward locations with densities <   106 cm- 3 (e.g., by factors of ~  2 where densities are ~  104 cm- 3; E. Bergin, private communication.) As discussed in § 4.1, however, mean densities are >  106 cm- 3 towards positions of bright N2H+ 1-0 emission in Oph A.

Figure 2c shows the N2H+ fractional abundance across Oph A, determined using values from Figures 3a and 3b (i.e., X(N2H+) = N(N2H+)/N(H2)). The mean X(N2H+) derived, 1.9 ×   10- 10, is similar to values derived for other dark clouds, e.g., X(N2H+) ≈   10- 10 has been found in various cores by Caselli et al. (2002a), Tafalla et al. (2002), Benson, Caselli, & Myers (1998), Womack et al. (1992), and Ohishi, Irvine, & Kaifu (1992). Within Oph A itself, Figure 2c shows that X(N2H+) varies by a factor of ~  40, with lower values at the edges of the filament and near the continuum objects like SM2, and higher values at positions at the extreme northern and southern ends of the filament. Table 3 lists the mean, rms, minimum, and maximum of X(N2H+) shown in Figure 2c.

Assuming LTE, our accuracy in determining X(N2H+) is limited by our knowledge of Tdust within Oph A. Indeed, isothermal dust is arguably not expected in Oph A given the number of nearby heating sources (i.e., embedded cluster members) and the wide range of column densities (i.e., extinctions) present. For the continuum objects, dust temperatures determined independently can be used to determine more refined, specific values of X(N2H+). Table 4 lists values of Tdust for continuum objects in Oph A by AWB93, determined by modeling their submillimeter spectral energy distributions. (AWB93 found dust emissivities of κν [formula] ν1.5, i.e., κ1.3mm ≈   0.01 cm2 g- 1, best fit their data.) AWB93 speculated these differences may be due to radiative heating by nearby sources to the northeast of SM1, e.g., the nearby B3 star S1. Table 4 also lists values of X(N2H+), N(N2H+), and N(H2) for VLA 1623, SM1N, SM1, and SM2 obtained by assuming the Tdust values of AWB93 in Equations 2 and 3 and averaging the resulting values over 3-4 beam-sized pixels coincident with each object. (For VLA 1623, upper limits for N(N2H+) and X(N2H+) are given in Table 4 since it is located where TmaxB <   3 σ.) The difference in X(N2H+) from one source to the next is smaller when constant Tdust is used. N2H+ abundances are similar for SM1N and SM1 while those of SM2 and VLA 1623 are lower by factors >  4. (Oph A-N6, also in Table 4, will be discussed in § 3.2.)

For locations in Oph A beyond the continuum objects, specific values of Tdust have not been defined, e.g., AWB93 did not derive Tdust values there. Maps of submillimeter continuum spectral indicies by AWB93, however, indicate that a Tdust gradient exists across Oph A, with lower Tdust (i.e., ≤   15 K) to the south or southwest (near VLA 1623 and SM2) and higher Tdust (i.e., ≥   25 K) to the north or northeast (near SM1 and SM1N). Unfortunately, the AWB93 submillimeter (e.g., 350 μm) continuum maps do not cover well the extreme northern and southern ends of the filament where we find the highest values of X(N2H+), i.e., assuming Tdust = 20 K. Without specific estimates for Tdust, it is difficult to refine our estimates of X(N2H+) at the ends of the filament. We note, however, that X(N2H+) at these locations would be quite similar to those of SM1 and SM1N if Tdust ≈   10-12 K, quite significantly reducing the abundance contrast shown by Figure 2c. At the very least, our observations suggest differences in X(N2H+) for the continuum objects in Oph A by factors ≥  4. Put simply, variations of both X(N2H+) and Tdust appear necessary to reconcile the 1.3 mm continuum and N2H+ line data of Oph A.

Line Widths

Figure 3a shows a map of ΔV obtained from the HFS fits of the combined N2H+ data of Oph A. The data shown are only those where TmaxB ≥   3 σ. The large variation of ΔV in Oph A by a factor of ~  5 differs from the relatively little variation of line widths (i.e., "coherence") found over similar ~  0.1 pc length scales in isolated, quiescent cores by Goodman et al. (1998). Table 4 lists the ΔV of SM1N, SM1, and SM2, obtained by averaging over 4 beam-sized pixels surrounding each object. These continuum objects are coincident with locations in Oph A with relatively broad N2H+ lines, i.e., ΔV  ≈   0.5-0.6 km s- 1. We note also that the largest line widths are found adjacent to (but not coincident with) these continuum objects.

Figure 3a shows fourteen locations in Oph A with ΔV ≤   0.30 km s- 1, which we arbitrarily define as "very narrow." Table 5 lists these positions, named here as locations "a" through "n", and gives their mean line width within the 0.3 km s- 1 contour. No very narrow line width location is coincident with an identified continuum object, although location "c", near A-MM5, may be an exception. Eleven very narrow line width locations are at the edges of the detected filament, where line peaks are relatively weak and near our detection limit (i.e., TmaxB  ≈  3 σ) and where HFS fits are relatively poor (e.g., typical ΔV uncertainties are ~  0.02-0.05 km s- 1.) Conversely, only the "b", "f, and "l" locations are well-defined local minima of ΔV; each is surrounded by larger ΔV and has line peaks well above our detection limit (e.g., typical ΔV uncertainties are ~  0.005-0.01 km s- 1). The extents of most very narrow line locations are therefore not well defined spatially since narrow line emission below our detection limit may or may not reside adjacent to each. Finally, most narrow line locations have detected extents smaller than the beam. Only the "c", "d", "l", and "m" locations have detected extents larger than the beam.

The very narrow line location "l" is especially notable in Oph A given its resolved extent, the relative brightness and the narrowness of its N2H+ 1-0 line emission, and its association with a maximum of integrated intensity (i.e., Oph A-N6). The "b" and "f" locations are like "l" in that they are also associated with bright emission (i.e., Oph A-N1), but unlike "l" they are each spatially unresolved and their lines are slightly broader than those of "l". The "c", "d", and "m" locations are like "l" in that they are each spatially resolved and their lines are similarly as narrow than those of "l" (or less), but unlike "l" they are not spatially well-defined and have weaker emission (i.e., no associations with integrated intensity maxima). These limitations make the "b", "c", "d", "f", and "m" locations more difficult to characterize than "l", so we concentrate on "l" in the following discussion. (The conclusions we reach on "l" may also apply to these other very narrow line positions.) Since "l" includes Oph A-N6 we henceforth refer to this "object" or location within Oph A simply as Oph A-N6 or N6 for short. Table 4 lists values of X(N2H+), etc., for N6 found by averaging values over 5 beam-sized pixels coincident with positions where ΔV ≤   0.30 km s- 1, and assuming Tdust = 15 K at that location (see § 3.1). Although the position of minimum line width in N6 is ~  19[formula] from its position of maximum integrated intensity, line emission is quite narrow throughout N6; when averaged over 5 adjacent beam-sized pixels, the ΔV of N6 is 0.25 km s- 1 (see Table 4).

The minimum line width in Oph A-N6 is remarkably small, only 0.193 ±   0.008 km s- 1. Figure 4 shows the spectrum of N2H+ 1-0 at the location of minimum line width in Oph A-N6, along with its HFS fit. All 7 hyperfine components of N2H+ 1-0 are unblended and clearly discernable at this position. Given the finite 0.07854 km s- 1 velocity resolution, the actual line widths are slightly less than the values shown in Figure 3a, depending on the line width. For example, the minimum ΔV in Oph A-N6 reduces to only 0.176 km s- 1 when the velocity resolution is subtracted in quadrature. Such narrow line widths are actually comparable to the thermal FWHMs expected for N2H+ given expected gas temperatures, Tgas, within Oph A. For example, Wootten et al. (2004, in preparation) using VLA NH3 data have determined gas temperatures for the Oph A continuum objects that are similar to the T = 20 K assumed by MAN98, i.e., 16 K for SM1, 21 K for SM1N, and 18 K for SM2. Other estimates of Tgas in Oph A can be made using the values of Tex found from HFS fits of the N2H+ 1-0 line at positions where τtot >  >  1, assuming the transition is thermalized, i.e., the local density is well above its 2 ×   105 cm- 3 critical density. (Below we show that this is reasonable within Oph A-N6, given its size and mass.) For the minimum ΔV spectrum shown in Figure 4, values of Tex = 18.1 K ±   3.4 K and τtot = 12.0 ±   2.2 were found, suggesting Tgas ≈   18 K. Within Oph A-N6 where τtot ≥   11.57 (i.e., where the optical depth of the brightest hyperfine component, 123-012, is at least 3), the mean Tex is 17.4 K. If Tgas = 18.1 K at the position of the spectrum shown in Figure 4, the expected thermal FHWM is 0.169 km s- 1. The FWHM of the nonthermal component to ΔV at this position, ΔVNT, obtained by subtracting in quadrature the thermal FWHM, ΔVT, from the resolution-corrected FWHM, is only 0.0500 km s- 1. Although the spectrum shown in Figure 4 is the narrowest in Oph A-N6, the gas velocities there are all remarkably dominated by thermal motions, with relatively little nonthermal contributions.

The occurrence of near-thermal line widths in Oph A is significant because the Ophiuchus star-forming clouds are turbulent on larger spatial scales and at lower densities (see Loren 1989a). Near-thermal line widths have been observed previously towards isolated cores; e.g., see Jijina, Myers, & Adams (1999) for a detailed list based on NH3 observations and Benson et al. (1998) and Caselli et al. (2002a) for N2H+ observations. Oph A-N6 is similar to the quiescent regions in Serpens NW identified using N2H+ 1-0 by Williams & Myers (2000). For example, the average ΔVNT for Oph A-N6, assuming Tgas = 18 K, is 0.17 km s- 1, similar to objects at the lower end of the ΔVNT range reported by Williams & Myers. There are, however, some important differences between Oph A-N6 and the quiescent Serpens objects. For example, the minimum ΔVNT of Oph A-N6 is smaller than those reported for the Serpens objects by a factor of ~  3. Furthermore, Oph A-N6 contains an obvious maximum of N2H+ 1-0 integrated intensity, whereas the Serpens objects are not. Other instances of N2H+ 1-0 as narrow as 0.2 km s- 1 were detected within NGC 1333 IRAS 4 by Di Francesco et al. 2001 (see also Walsh et al. 2004, in preparation, for other locations in NGC 1333.) In contrast to Oph A-N6, ΔVNT = 0.46-0.57 km s- 1 for SM1N, SM1, and SM2, given their respective values of ΔV listed in Table 4 and the Tgas values found by Wootten et al.

Within Ophiuchus, extremely narrow lines such as those described here have been uncommonly observed, possibly due to the relatively large beam sizes of earlier studies. For example, Loren (1989b) found ΔV = 1.7 km s- 1 for 13CO 1-0 in the general Oph A region (R22) when observed with a 2.4[formula] beam (although the line was considered saturated.) In addition, Tachihara, Mizuno, & Fukui (2000) found ΔV = 1.5 km s- 1 for the C18O 1-0 core in the neighbourhood of Oph A (ρ Oph 2). Furthermore, LWW90 found ΔV = 0.8 km s- 1 and 0.7 km s- 1 for DCO+ 3-2 at the "core center" of Oph A (defined then as ~  10[formula] west of SM1N) when observed with a 1 FWHM beam and a 0 FWHM beam respectively. Belloche et al. (2001), however, detected relatively narrow N2H+ 1-0 lines at various locations within Oph, e.g., ΔV = 0.26 km s- 1 toward Oph E-MM2, in IRAM 30 m Telescope data alone (obtained with a 0 FWHM beam.) Our IRAM 30 m Telescope data is a subset of the Belloche et al. data and across Oph A-N6 they show no evidence of the narrower lines seen in the combined data, i.e, ΔV = 0.35 km s- 1. Our high angular resolution data have revealed locations of extremely narrow line emission in Oph A.

Line Centroids and Profiles

Figure 3b shows a map of VLSR, the central velocity of the N2H+ 1-0 line, in Oph A obtained from HFS fits to the combined data. Immediately striking in this Figure is the narrow range of VLSR values within Oph A; the rms of VLSR values is only 0.17 km s- 1 (see Table 1). Figure 3b reveals no large-scale gradient of VLSR along Oph A but small-scale gradients are possibly found near the continuum objects SM1N, SM1, and SM2, roughly aligned east-west or west-east. Other possible gradients include one north of VLA 1623 aligned north-south, and one northwest of SM1N (and Oph A-N1) aligned northwest-southeast. In contrast, no VLSR gradient is found toward Oph A-N6. (As noted earlier, weak emission in its periphery are at slightly lower VLSR.)

Figure 5 shows a spectral grid of N2H+ 101-012, the "isolated component" of N2H+ across Oph A, where each panel shows the line averaged over a (beam-sized) 10 ×   6 area. The variation of ΔV and lack of variation of VLSR across Oph A are easily apparent in this Figure, but the line shapes are more evident here than possible from maps of HFS fit parameters. Figure 5 reveals that the N2H+ line profiles in Oph A are typically symmetric in most locations, with little evidence for self-reversal or asymmetry. This appearance is consistent with the relatively low optical depths of the lines here as obtained from HFS fits (see Figure 2b). Only at a position just west of SM1 is a single self-reversal found, and perhaps not coincidentally this location is also that of maximum N(N2H+) in Oph A as derived from the HFS fits. The line shapes reveal little evidence for the asymmetrically-blue line profiles that suggest infall motions, such as those seen in N2H+ 1-0 towards L1544 by Williams et al. (1998), likely also due to the relatively low optical depths of the line in Oph A. Only one possible instance of blue asymmetry is found in Oph A, immediately southwest of SM1. This spectrum, however, is adjacent to an instance of red asymmetry, and both asymmetries may be consistent with having been made from noise across the line. The line shapes also show no evidence for broad line wings expected from high velocity outflows.

Surprisingly, the line velocities of N2H+ 1-0 appear correlated with its line width, but only for the brightest lines in Oph A, i.e. towards the highest N2H+ column densities. Figure 6a shows that higher velocity (redder) lines are systematically wider in lines where TmaxB ≥   10 σ. A linear fit to the data shown in Figure 6a reveals a fairly high correlation parameter r of 0.82 (see Press et al. 1992). Figure 6b shows, however, that a similar correlation between VLSR and ΔV is less likely for lines with TmaxB <   10 σ; the r obtained from a linear fit to this subsample is only 0.31. Figure 7 shows evidence that the line widths are increasing because only their red sides are moving to higher velocities and their blue sides are not shifting in velocity. Three pairs of 2 spectra of the N2H+ 101-012 line are shown, taken from different positions in Oph A, where each pair consists of an average over 2-4 neighboring pixels with bright narrow emission in Oph A and an average over 4-6 surrounding pixels with fainter, broader emission. This Figure suggests that the trend shown in Figure 6a is not simply a matter of the widths of bright lines increasing as the entire line shifts to higher velocities. A similar trend is suggested by N2H+ 1-0 line data of the quiescent region Q8 of Serpens (Williams & Myers) and NGC 1333 IRAS 4B in Perseus (Di Francesco et al.)

Discussion

Our combined single-dish and interferometer data have revealed interesting variations of N2H+ abundance and the width and centroid velocity of the N2H+ 1-0 line within the Oph A filament. Together, these variations provide a qualitative picture of the protostellar evolution of gas and dust in a relatively dense star-forming core, assuming that the differences are due solely to evolution. In this picture, the "object" Oph A-N6 represents a relatively early, quiescent stage marked by high density, low Tdust, high X(N2H+), low ΔV, and little local variation of VLSR. SM2, however, represents a more-evolved protostellar stage with higher density, low Tdust, low X(N2H+), medium ΔV, and some local variation of VLSR. SM1N and SM1 may be at a similar protostellar stage as SM2 given their similar ΔV and variation of VLSR, but their higher X(N2H+) may reflect their higher Tdust. Finally, VLA 1623, which has just formed a protostar (AWB93), is representative of the next stage of evolution, namely the beginning of the protostellar phase. It has high density, low Tdust, and very low X(N2H+). In the following, we describe in more detail how the differences in X(N2H+), ΔV, and VLSR between the Oph A objects result in this qualitative picture.

N2H+ Abundances

Variations of N2H+ abundance in Oph A point to subtle differences in the evolutionary stages of its starless objects due to the expected behavior of X(N2H+) within cold, dense environments. Although X(N2H+) can be reduced locally as a result of outflows, e.g., when H2O and CO are returned to the gas phase by shocks and quickly deplete N2H+ via ion-molecule reactions (see Bergin, Neufeld, & Melnick 1998; van Dishoeck & Hogerheijde 1999), these objects do not contain or are not impacted by any outflowing gas (Kamazaki et al. 2001, 2003). Lee et al. (2003) have suggested molecular abundance differences between starless objects can be related also to the relative ratio of their dynamical and chemical time scales (i.e., their respective environments), but the Oph A objects should have this factor in common since they are situated within the same core. Gas-grain chemistry at high densities and low temperatures is a very plausible cause of these variations.

Examples of the effect of gas-grain chemistry on X(N2H+) in cold, dense environments were recently provided by Aikawa, Ohashi, & Herbst (2003; AOH03). AOH03 found from isothermal (i.e., TK = 10 K) models of Larson-Penston collapsing starless objects that central X(N2H+) increases when central densities increase up to ~  3 ×   106 cm- 3 (e.g., that expected for L1544), as the principal destroyers of N2H+ like CO become strongly depleted onto dust grains (see also Bergin & Langer, Shematovich et al. 2003). At densities ≈   3 ×   107 cm- 3, however, AOH03 found that X(N2H+) decreases by a factor of ~  2 from its maximum within a ~  1000 AU radius as N2, from which N2H+ forms, is adsorbed onto dust grains. Although not explored explicitly by AOH03, further N2H+ depletion may be expected at still higher central densities. Observational evidence for central N2H+ depletions have been reported recently in isolated starless objects with central densities of ~  105 - 6 cm- 3, e.g., B68 (Bergin et al.), L1544 (Caselli et al. 2003), and IRAM 04191+1522 (Belloche & Andre 2004, in preparation).

The models of AOH03 imply that depletion of N2H+ can be hard to observe directly with large beams. For example, no central minimum in N(N2H+) can be seen when their model core is "observed" with a beam of ~  4000 AU equivalent FWHM (see their Figure 9). Given their small extent, such N2H+ depletion zones would be easier to detect directly with smaller beams. For example, our combined N2H+ data have a geometrical mean linear resolution of 970 AU at the 125 pc distance of Oph A, or about half the diameter of the central N2H+ depletion zone in the AOH03 models. The variations of X(N2H+) between the Oph A objects we observe could be then explained as the result of detecting differing amounts of depletion due to density differences between objects. MAN98 determined mean densities for SM1N, SM1, and SM2 from their 1.3 mm continuum observations ranging from ~  5 ×   106 cm- 3 (SM2) to ~  4 ×   107 cm- 3 (SM1N), i.e., in the regime where central N2H+ depletions were found by AOH03. Note, however, that the AOH03 models had constant TK = 10 K, so the possible effect on depletion that warmer Tdust may have must also be considered in an intepretation.

Table 4 lists X(N2H+), N(N2H+), and N(H2) for Oph A-N6 in addition to those for VLA 1623, SM1N, SM1, and SM2, also found using Equations 2 and 3 and averaging over coincident beam-sized pixels. For N6, we assume Tdust = 15 K following AWB93, although they suggested that Tdust ≤   15 K southeast of SM2. The N(N2H+) of N6, 6 ×   1013 cm- 2, lies between the higher values of SM1 and SM1N and the lower values of SM2 and VLA 1623. On the other hand, the N(H2) of N6, ~  3 ×   1023 cm- 2, is actually similar to those of SM1N and SM1, but appears smaller than those of VLA 1623 and SM2.

Relative to Oph A-N6, VLA 1623 and SM2 have likely higher mean densities, given their apparently larger N(H2) and more compact appearance as 1.3 mm continuum maxima. In the context of the AOH03 models, their low N2H+ column densities are due to N2H+ depletion at high density. Since VLA 1623 has formed a protostar (or two; see Looney, Mundy, & Welch 2000) but SM2 not formed any, the mean density of VLA 1623 should be even larger than that of SM2. The weaker N2H+ emission of VLA 1623 compared to SM2 likely reflects even greater N2H+ depletion that should accompany higher density. (In addition, N2H+ depletion toward VLA 1623 may be enhanced if grain mantles containing CO have returned to the gas phase through evaporation or outflow shocks.) SM1N and SM1 do not fit easily into this sequence, however, as they have higher N(N2H+) but similar N(H2). Their higher N(N2H+) may reflect their warmer Tdust relative to SM2 if N2 does not easily adsorb onto their warmer dust grains. CO, however, is likely also not adsorbed readily at these Tdust values, and its presence in the gas phase likely would reduce N(N2H+) rather than increase it. The relatively high N(N2H+) for SM1N and SM1 may be due to internal, dense regions where CO has been depleted but not N2, i.e., that are cooler than suggested by their (average) Tdust but warmer than regions of similar density in SM2.

Since density must increase as a result of evolution towards star formation and X(N2H+) appears to decrease above ~  106 cm- 3, X(N2H+) may be useful as an indicator of the relative evolution of several objects forming within the same dense core. Our X(N2H+) results alone therefore suggest that Oph A-N6 is at an earlier stage relative to SM2 and that SM2 is at an earlier stage relative to VLA 1623. Given the warmer Tdust of SM1N and SM1 relative to SM2, their evolutionary stage relative to N6, SM2, and VLA 1623 is difficult to judge. We stress that these results are highly qualitative. Evans et al. (2001) and Zucconi, Walmsley, & Galli (2001) have shown recently that Bonnor-Ebert spheres with radial temperature gradients (e.g., with low central Tdust) are better than isothermal models in reproducing the observed dust emission of isolated starless objects, and the Tdust values derived by AWB93 and used here are likely averages of the actual dust temperature distributions within the Oph A objects. More detailed modeling of the dust continuum emission of all these objects is clearly required to determine better their thermal and density structures and provide more quantitative results, especially if N2 depletion onto dust grains is strongly dependent on Tdust.

Nonthermal Motions and Velocity Gradients

Variations of the ΔV and VLSR of N2H+ 1-0 in Oph A allow us to probe the dynamics of dense gas within the core. Complementing the previous discussion on N2H+ abundances, the dynamics of dense gas provide further insight into the relative evolution of objects within Oph A. In the following, we consider separately the dynamics of Oph A as a whole and of its population of starless objects, as well as those of Oph A-N6 relative to SM1N, SM1, and SM2.

The Oph A Core

The effective average velocity dispersion of gas, σ, within Oph A can be estimated from our data and compared to simple models to evaluate the dynamical state of the core. Following Bertoldi & McKee (1992; Appendix C), σ can be estimated in several ways. First, the dispersion of an average spectrum comprised of all line data across the core can be measured and σ2 is approximately equal to the quadrature sum of this quantity and the thermal dispersion, i.e., that of velocities of mean molecular mass expected from thermal motions. The FWHM resulting from a Gaussian fit to such an average spectrum from our Oph A data is 0.58 km s- 1, yielding σ = 0.36 km s- 1 if TK = 20 K. Second, the rms of both ΔV and VLSR can be measured and σ2 is approximately equal to the sum of the squares of these quantities and the thermal dispersion. Using values from Table 1 and again assuming TK = 20 K, σ = 0.33 km s- 1, i.e., within 10% of the first value.

The estimated σ of Oph A is similar to but less than expected from simple virial arguments, i.e., those that ignore contributions from surface pressure and magnetic fields. For example, the average total one-dimensional velocity dispersion of a virialized core can be estimated by equating 2T = 2(3/2)Mσ2, the magnitude of the total core kinetic energy (M is the total core mass), and W = (3 / 5R)aGM2, the magnitude of the total core gravitational potential energy (Rm is the average projected core size, G is the gravitational constant, and a is a dimensionless parameter accounting for core asphericity and nonuniformity; see Bertoldi & McKee). For Oph A, M ≈   11 M[formula], assuming Tdust = 20 K on average and using the 1.3 mm continuum data of MAN98 over positions with detected N2H+ 1-0 emission. We find σ = 0.57 km s- 1, assuming this mass and uniformity in density. (An aspect ratio of ~  7 and a projected semiminor axis of ~  0.01 pc are also assumed, yielding Rm = 0.023 pc and a = 0.78; see Fig. 2 of Bertoldi & McKee.) These velocities suggest Oph A as a whole is in gravitational virial equilibrium to first order, i.e., they are within a factor of 2 of those required. (Although these velocities suggest Oph A has insufficient support against gravity in the absence of significant magnetic energy, the difference is likely not significant given the uncertainties in our analysis.) AWB93 also concluded the Oph A filament was similarly close to gravitational virial equilibrium, based on their submillimeter continuum data and a typical ΔV from available line data. More recently, Tachihara et al. found similar conclusions for (lower density) star forming C18O cores in the near-neighborhood of Oph A. Better determinations of the local magnetic field strengths are clearly needed to evaluate better the global dynamical state of Oph A.

The Starless Object Population

Variations of VLSR in the population of objects within Oph A provide constraints on some models of clustered star formation. Table 4 lists the VLSR of SM1N, SM1, SM2, and Oph A-N6, obtained by averaging 4-5 beam-sized pixels around each object. The rms of these values is only 0.10 km s- 1, or ~  0.4 cs(20 K), the isothermal sound speed of molecular gas at Tgas = 20 K. The similarities between the VLSR of gas associated with the continuum objects and Oph A-N6 suggest strongly that all these lie within the same filament, and are not objects in separate cores seen by coincidence near each other towards Ophiuchus. Furthermore, the objects do not have substantial radial velocities relative to their neighboring dense gas. For example, the mean difference in the VLSR of a given Oph A object and the mean of its surrounding gas is only 0.06 km s- 1, much smaller than the rms of VLSR. This value is only ~  0.25 cs(20 K), i.e., at the low end of expected mean relative gas velocities in cluster formation models where starless objects move ballistically within a core and accrete mass competitively (e.g., see Bonnell et al. 1997, 2001). The Oph A objects, however, are few in number, are found in close proximity, and as a whole may be at a relatively early, slow stage of such an evolution (e.g., when gas dominates the gravitational potential).

Oph A-N6

Variations of ΔV between starless objects in Oph A may be also related to these objects being at different stages in the evolution of dense gas towards star formation. Here we consider Oph A-N6 as an object, to place its physical characteristics in the context of models relevant to these epochs. Unlike SM1, SM1N, and SM2, N6 is not a local 2D maximum of continuum emission (i.e., N(H2)), but instead resides on a gradient of continuum emission along the local northwest-southeast direction of the filamentary N2H+ 1-0 emission. Note, however, that N6 is at least at a 1D maximum of continuum emission in the direction perpendicular to the filament.

Given its 125 pc distance and following our arbitrary definition of its extent, i.e., where ΔV ≤   0.30 km s- 1, Oph A-N6 has a (nondeconvolved) geometrical mean radius of 0.008 pc. From its 1.3 mm continuum emission (see Fig. 1a) and assuming its dust is isothermal at Tdust = 15 K, N6 has a mean column density of 2.5 ×   1023 cm- 2 and a mass of 0.9 M[formula]. (Assuming N6 is a sphere, its mean density is 7.6 ×   106 cm- 2, well above the 2.5 ×   105 critical density of the N2H+ 1-0 line.) In addition, N6 has a mean ΔV = 0.25 km s- 1 (see Table 4), suggesting a mean dispersion for the N2H+ 1-0 line of 0.11 km s- 1. Assuming the gas of N6 is isothermal at Tgas = 17.4 K (see § 3), the mean nonthermal component σNT = 0.080 km s- 1 and σ = 0.26 km s- 1.

The observed quantities of Oph A-N6 are within a factor of 2 of those predicted from simple models of equilibrium spheres. For example, the mass-radius ratio of a uniform sphere in gravitational virial equilibrium is 5σ2 / G and that of a critically-stable Bonnor-Ebert sphere is 2.4σ2 / G (Bonnor 1956). Given the effective radius and mass of N6, the mean velocity dispersions predicted from these simple models are 0.31 km s- 1 and 0.45 km s- 1 respectively, i.e., more than that of N6 itself by factors of 1.2 and 1.7 respectively. Like Oph A as a whole, N6 is in gravitational virial equilibrium to first order. (Again, the differences are likely not significant enough to suggest N6 has insufficent support against gravity.) Interestingly, the mass and radius of N6 can be reproduced simultaneously if the mass-radius ratio ≈   7σ2 / G, a situation that could occur, e.g., in virial equilibrium if magnetic energy B ≈   (6 / 5)Mσ2, or more if surface pressure is also non-zero.

There are three questions about Oph A-N6 that simple equilibrium models do not directly address. First, why does N6 have such narrow line widths that suggest it has relatively little turbulence? Second, why are these line widths narrower than those in its immediate surroundings? Third, why is N6 located so close to its neighbor SM2? These questions may be answered simultaneously by considering models of equilibrium spheres embedded in sufficiently turbulent and opaque cores. Within such environments, turbulent motions could be reduced locally, e.g., if the spheres were similar or smaller in size than the cutoff wavelength for MHD waves in their surroundings (McKee 1989, McKee et al. 1993). (Turbulence could instead be damped locally by other processes such as shocks or dissipation; e.g., see Nakano 1998.) Myers (1999; see also Myers 1997), following reasoning by Larson (1985) and Mouschovias (1991), proposed thermally dominated, critically stable Bonnor-Ebert spheres could exist within turbulent, opaque, and dense cores. Such cores require large column densities (e.g., AV >   4), so that ionization by cosmic rays dominates over that by ultraviolet radiation, and the coupling between the magnetic field and the gas is minimized. The embedded objects, called "kernels" by Myers, would be compressed by external (turbulent) core pressure to sizes comparable to the observed separations of young stellar objects within embedded clusters (e.g., ~  0.05-0.15 pc). A protostellar cluster could then arise from the near-simultaneous collapse of several kernels within a common core.

Oph A-N6 may be an excellent candidate for a kernel-like object, given its near-thermal line widths. Furthermore, its 0.9 M[formula] mass matches quite well the 0.8 M[formula] mean mass predicted for kernels within nearby star forming molecular cores, i.e., masses obtained by Myers using values of T, ΔVNT and n derived by from Harju, Walmsley, & Wouterloot (1993) and Ladd, Myers, & Goodman (1994). Also, the projected separation between N6 and SM2 is 0.025 pc, within a factor of ~  2 of the ~  0.05 pc separation of kernels predicted by Myers. (Indeed, the mean nearest-neighbor separation of N6, SM1N, SM1, SM2, and VLA 1623, is only 0.023 pc.) Oph A-N6 does not fit completely to a kernel interpretation, however. As noted above, its 0.008 pc radius is ~  3 smaller than the 0.024 pc mean radius expected for such kernels. (Note that the radius of a singular isothermal sphere (Shu 1977) at T = 17.4 K required to make a 0.9 M[formula] star is ~  0.032 pc, a factor of ~  4 larger than that of N6.) Despite these caveats, however, the kernel model provides at least some basis for understanding N6 as a highly localized region of low turbulence, unlike simple equilibrium models.

The non-detection of Oph A-N6 as a two-dimensional maximum of N(H2) but its clear detection as a location of maximal N(N2H+) suggest that interesting sites possibly related to star formation may be overlooked in maps of thermal continuum emission. Why was N6 not seen, e.g., by MAN98? Contrasts of N(H2) in N6 could be minimized if dust at its inner radii are colder than dust at its outer radii (e.g., see Evans et al.), a strong possibility given the high densities and extinctions observed in Oph A. Note, however, that Bouwman, Galli, & André (2004, in preparation; see also André et al. 2003) have recently shown that 1.3 mm continuum flux and Tdust are anticorrelated in starless cores, even those with the high column densities and incident radiation fields of Oph A (e.g., 85 Go; Liseau et al. 1999). The Oph A objects, especially N6, must be specifically modeled to evaluate better this possibility.

If Oph A-N6 is a kernel-like object, we speculate that the Oph A continuum objects may also be or once were kernel-like. In this scenario, the large ΔV of these objects relative to that of Oph A-N6 may suggest that they are now in a state of collapse. For example, N6 has narrow lines close to the thermal line width; an absence of wings or asymmetrically blue profiles in the line suggest that collapse has not yet occurred. If the continuum objects have had similar physical conditions to N6 earlier, turbulence may have been similarly reduced at that epoch. Therefore, their larger ΔV may not be due to substantial turbulent motions in their associated gas. Indeed, how turbulent motions could be reintroduced to these objects after its reduction in the absence of protostars, winds, or outflows is unclear. Instead, gas within these objects may still be thermally dominated and the line broadening observed may be due to infall motions stemming from collapse. The N2H+ 1-0 line is only marginally optically thick toward these objects, so the line should remain symmetric, as seen in Figure 5, if emitted from infalling gas (Myers, Evans, & Ohashi 2000). We note here again that SM1, SM1N, and SM2 are found relatively close to (but are not coincident with) positions of the largest ΔV in Oph A; these extreme line widths may also be caused by infall motions related to these objects. Furthermore, the correlation of ΔV vs. VLSR found for bright line emission shown in Fig. 6a may be also related to infall motions. The observed FWZIs of N2H+ 1-0 toward SM1N, SM1, and SM2 are ~  1.0 km s- 1, suggesting infall motions on scales of ~  1000-3000 AU up to 0.5 km s- 1, similar to those measured directly toward the Class 0 objects NGC 1333 IRAS 4A and 4B by Di Francesco et al.

Further speculating, we note that the variations of VLSR in Oph A may provide additional evidence for differences in the evolutionary stages of starless objects within Oph A, by supporting the idea that Oph A-N6 is not collapsing but SM1N, SM1, and SM2 may be. N6 appears to have no associated N2H+ 1-0 velocity gradients but the continuum objects have small ones (i.e., ≤  0.5 km s- 1 over ~  0.01 pc; see Fig. 3b). Such small velocity gradients could stem from increases in local rotation speeds of dense gas that could accompany inward motions due to angular momentum conservation. (Indeed line broadening by rotational motions may also be contributing to the larger line widths associated with these objects. Note that the gradients in Fig. 3b, however, are seen on scales larger than the beam size.) High-resolution data of Oph A in other tracers of quiescent dense gas that require higher levels of excitation than N2H+ 1-0 could reveal velocity gradients more dominated by infall or rotation and clarify this issue (e.g., see Caselli et al. 2002b).

Summary and Conclusions

1. Combined single-dish and interferometer data of N2H+ 1-0 line emission from Oph A are presented that yield a map of dense gas at high linear resolution (e.g., ~  1000 AU) with information retained on large spatial scales. Six maxima of integrated line intensity, Oph A-N1 through N6, have been detected. N4 and N5 are coincident with the starless objects SM1 and SM1N respectively. The other maxima, however, are not coincident with known starless or protostellar Oph A objects. Moreover, little N2H+ 1-0 emission is associated with the starless object SM2 or the Class 0 protostar VLA 1623. This situation is in contrast with observations of isolated cores where dust peaks and integrated N2H+ intensity maxima are commonly coincident.

2. With 1.3 mm continuum data from MAN98 and Tdust estimates from AWB93, N(N2H+), N(H2), and X(N2H+) were estimated for the Oph A objects. SM1 and SM1N have similar values of X(N2H+) ≈   2-3 ×   10- 10. SM2 and VLA 1623, however, have values of X(N2H+) that are factors of >  4 less than those of SM1 and SM1N. The X(N2H+) of Oph A-N6 is similar to that of SM1 and SM1N, if Tdust ≈   15 K at that location. For SM2 and VLA 1623, the lower values of X(N2H+) are likely due to gas-grain chemistry in cold, dense cores where N2 adsorbs onto grain surfaces and N2H+ is depleted, as suggested by many. Similar depletion may not have occurred at SM1 or SM1N because their dust is warmer, e.g., Tdust = 27 K, perhaps inhibiting N2 adsoption.

3. N2H+ 1-0 line widths (ΔV) in Oph A vary by a factor of ~  5 with values <  0.30 km s- 1 found in fourteen locations. Of these, only the location associated with the N6 maximum of integrated intensity is both a local minimum of line width and has an extent larger than the beam size. The minimum ΔV in N6 is only 0.193 km s- 1, or just larger than line widths expected from thermal motions alone at expected temperatures. In contrast, the ΔV associated with the SM1, SM1N, and SM2 objects are ~  0.5 km s- 1.

4. N2H+ 1-0 line centroids (VLSR) in Oph A vary little across the core, having an rms of only ~  0.17 km s- 1. No large-scale gradient is seen across Oph A, although small-scale VLSR gradients of <  0.5 km s- 1 over 0.01 pc are associated with SM1, SM1N, and SM2, but not with N6. The ΔV and VLSR of Oph A as a whole yield a one-dimensional velocity dispersion, σ, for Oph A that is a factor of ~  2 of that required for gravitational virial equilibrium.

5. The low ΔV and lack of VLSR gradient of N6 relative to SM1, SM1N, and SM2 suggest evolutionary differences. The one-dimensional velocity of N6 suggest it alone is within a factor of 2 from gravitational virial equilibrium. N6 has properties (e.g., ΔV, mass, and short proximity to neighbors) similar to those predicted for "kernels", i.e., thermally dominated, critically stable, Bonnor-Ebert spheres embedded within turbulent cores, although some of its properties (e.g., size and no column density maximum) are dissimilar. N6 may represent an early stage of the evolution of dense gas towards star formation where significant local reduction of turbulent motions occurs. The non-detection of N6 in thermal continuum maps of Oph A suggests that interesting sites possibly related to star formation may be missed in such maps.
