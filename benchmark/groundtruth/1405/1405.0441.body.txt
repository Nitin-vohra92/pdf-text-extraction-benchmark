ABSTRACT

Using a multi-fluid approach, we investigate streaming and thermal instabilities of the electron-ion plasma with homogeneous cold cosmic rays propagating perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Perturbations are considered to be also across the magnetic field. The back-reaction of cosmic rays resulting in strong streaming instabilities is taken into account. It is shown that for sufficiently short wavelength perturbations, the growth rates can exceed the growth rate of cosmic-ray streaming instability along the magnetic field found by Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012), which is in its turn considerably larger than the growth rate of the Bell instability (2004). The thermal instability is shown not to be subject to the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relation for the thermal instability has been derived which includes sound velocities of plasma and cosmic rays, Alfvén and cosmic-ray streaming velocities. The relation between these parameters determines the kind of thermal instability ranging from the Parker (1953) to the Field (1965) instabilities. The results obtained can be useful for a more detailed investigation of electron-ion astrophysical objects such as supernova remnant shocks, galaxy clusters and others including the dynamics of streaming cosmic rays.

Introduction

Cosmic rays are an important ingredient in astrophysical environments (see, e.g., Zweibel 2003). They are capable of affecting the dynamics of astrophysical plasma media leading to plasma heating, increasing the level of ionization, driving outflows, modifying shocks, and so on (Zweibel 2003; Field et al. 1969; Guo & Oh 2008; Everett et al. 2008; Beresnyak et al. 2009; Samui et al. 2010; Enß lin et al. 2011). Cosmic-ray ionization contributes to star formation (e.g., Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007) and coupling of gas to the magnetic field in accretion disks (Gammie 1996).

Thermal instability (Field 1965) have been used to explain existence of the cold dense structures in the interstellar (Field 1965; Begelman & McKee 1990; Koyama & Inutsuka 2000; Hennebelle & Pérault 2000; Sánchez-Salcedo et al. 2002; Vázquez-Semadeni et al. 2006; Fukue and Kamaya 2007; Inoue & Inutsuka 2008; Shadmehri et al. 2010) and intracluster (ICM; Field 1965; Mathews & Bregman 1978; Balbus & Soker 1989; Loewenstein 1990; Bogdanovi et al. 2009; Parrish et al. 2009; Sharma et al. 2010) media. For example, molecular filaments have been observed in galaxy clusters by Conselice et al. (2001), Salomé et al. (2006), Cavagnolo et al. (2008), and O'Dea et al. (2008).

In galaxy clusters, cosmic rays are wide spread (e.g., Guo & Oh 2008; Enß lin et al. 2011). Therefore, they could exert influence on thermal instability. In particular, including cosmic rays is required to explain the atomic and molecular lines observed in filaments in clusters of galaxies by Ferland et al. (2009). Such an investigation has been performed by Sharma et al. (2010) in the framework of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. Numerical analysis has shown that the cosmic-ray pressure can elongate cold filaments along the magnetic field lines. However in general, cosmic rays can be relativistic and have the streaming velocity of the order of the speed of light and the mean energy larger than the particle rest energy. The interaction of such particles with the thermal plasma can not be considered in the framework of the conventional MHD.

It is well-known that the cosmic-ray drift current results in arising of the return current in the background plasma and of streaming instabilities generating magnetic fields (Achterberg 1983; Zweibel 2003; Bell 2004, 2005; Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2009, 2010). In papers by Achterberg (1983), Zweibel (2003), and Bell (2004), the kinetic consideration of circularly-polarized electromagnetic waves traveling along the background magnetic field where cosmic rays also drift along the latter has been provided. For the case of the large cosmic-ray Larmor radius in comparison with the wavelength, Bell (2004) has found the growth rate some larger than that for the resonant cyclotron instability proposed long time ago by Kulsrud and Pearce (1969). The general case for the arbitrary mutual orientation of the background magnetic field, the cosmic-ray current and the wave vector of perturbations has been considered by Bell (2005) within the MHD framework. Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) have explored the case in which the cosmic-ray current is perpendicular to the initial magnetic field and perturbations are excited along the latter. In papers by Bell (2004, 2005) and Riquelmi & Spitkovsky (2010), instabilities were excited due to the return plasma current and obtained growth rates were of the same order of magnitude. The dynamics of cosmic rays did not play the role (in the analytical consideration). Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012) have included the back-reaction of cosmic rays in the multi-fluid approach for the model by Riquelmi & Spitkovsky (2010) and found the growth rate for the streaming instability considerably larger than that of Bell (2004, 2005) and of Riquelmi & Spitkovsky (2010) by a factor of the square root from the ratio of plasma to cosmic-ray number densities. The second result obtained by Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012) was that the thermal instability is not subject to the action of cosmic rays in the model considered. Instabilities along the background magnetic field driven by the back-reaction of relativistic cosmic rays drifting also parallel to the magnetic field have been considered by Nekrasov (2013).

These findings motivated us to investigate the case in which perturbations arise transversely to the ambient magnetic field in the directions both along and across the perpendicular cosmic-ray current. Such a current can appear due to diamagnetic drift of cosmic rays and inhomogeneity of the magnetic field (Bell 2005), due to gravitational cosmic-ray drift in magnetic field and so on. Riquelmi & Spitkovsky (2010) have discussed a possibility of an appearance of the perpendicular cosmic-ray current because of the magnetic wall effect of low-energy magnetized cosmic rays in the pre-amplified  magnetic fields in the upstream medium of supernova remnant shocks. We note that such a mechanism can also operate in other cases in which cosmic rays encounter magnetic clouds. As it follows from Bell (2005), where the one-fluid MHD equations are used, the streaming instability does not exist for perturbations perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, this result is incorrect in the multi-fluid consideration (for three and more species) that is shown in this paper and has been obtained earlier (e.g., Nekrasov 2007). We here include the induced return current of the background plasma and back-reaction of cosmic rays. In this approach, dispersion relations are derived and growth rates are found analytically. We also consider possible effects of cosmic rays on the thermal instability for the geometry under consideration. We provide a comparison of results obtained in this paper with those of Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012) and show a difference between them.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the fundamental equations for plasma, cosmic rays, and electromagnetic fields used in this paper. The zero order state is discussed in Section 3. Wave equations are given in Section 4. In Sections 5 and 6, the dispersion relations including the plasma return current, cosmic-ray back-reaction and the terms describing the thermal instability are derived and their solutions are found for perturbations along and across the cosmic-ray current, respectively. Discussion of important results obtained and possible astrophysical implications are provided in Section 7. Conclusive remarks are summarized in Section 8.

Basic equations for a plasma and cosmic rays

The fundamental equations for a plasma are the following:

[formula]

the equation of motion,

[formula]

the continuity equation,

[formula]

and

[formula]

are the temperature equations for ions and electrons. In Equations (1) and (2), the index j = i,e denotes the ions and electrons, respectively. Notations in Equations (1)-(4) are the following: qj and mj are the charge and mass of species j; [formula] is the hydrodynamic velocity; nj is the number density; pj = njTj is the thermal pressure; Tj is the temperature; νεie(ne,Te) ([formula]) is the frequency of the thermal energy exchange between ions (electrons) and electrons (ions) being νεie(ne,Te) = 2νie, where νie is the collision frequency of ions with electrons (Braginskii 1965); [formula]; γ is the ratio of the specific heats; [formula] and [formula] are the electric and magnetic fields; and c is the speed of light in vacuum. We include the thermal energy exchange because the corresponding frequency νεie (νεei) must be compared with the dynamical frequency for thermal instability. The cooling and heating of plasma species in Equations (3) and (4) are described by the function [formula], where Λj and Γj are the cooling and heating functions, respectively. This function has some deviation from the usually used cooling-heating function £ (Field 1965). Both functions are connected to each other via the equality [formula]. Our choice is analogous to those of Begelman & Zweibel (1994), Bogdanovi et al. (2009), and Parrish et al. (2009). The function [formula] can be found, for example, in Tozzi & Norman (2001). We do not take into account the transverse thermal fluxes in the temperature equations, which are small in a weekly collisional plasma (Braginskii 1965) being considered in this paper. For simplicity, we do not take into account a collisional coupling of ions and electrons in Equation (1). The corresponding condition will be given in Section 7.

The cosmic rays that we are interested in here, are considered as a possible source of the magnetic field generation and amplification in different astrophysical environments in which cosmic-ray fluxes may exist (Zweibel & Everett 2010) as well as their possible influence on thermal instability. It is important that cosmic rays have a drift velocity or a current relative to the direction of the background magnetic field and can excite instabilities due to their streaming. In this case, we are not interested in the cosmic-ray history, i.e., in the spatial and momentum diffusion of the quasi-isotropic cosmic-ray distribution function, described by the transport equation in the turbulent medium (e.g., Skilling 1975), and consider cosmic rays as beams governed by MHD equations in the vicinity of their local sources. Such an approach is adopted in the beam-plasma systems to study streaming instabilities. Equations for relativistic cosmic rays which can be in general both protons and electrons, we apply in the form of relativistic MHD equations given by Lontano et al. (2001)

[formula]

[formula]

where

[formula]

In these equations, [formula] is the momentum of a cosmic-ray particle having the rest mass mcr and velocity [formula], qcr is its charge, pcr  =  γ- 1crncrTcr is the kinetic pressure, ncr is the number density in the laboratory frame, Γcr is the adiabatic index, [formula] is the relativistic factor. The continuity equation for cosmic rays is the same as Equation (2) at j = cr. Equation (7) can be used for both cold nonrelativistic, Tcr  ≪   mcrc2, and hot relativistic, Tcr  ≫   mcrc2, cosmic rays. In the first (second) case, we have Γcr = 5 / 3 (4 / 3) (Lontano et al. 2001). The general form of the value Rcr, which is valid for any relations between Tcr and mcrc2, can be found, e.g., in Toepfer (1971) and Dzhavakhishvili & Tsintsadze (1973). We note that relativistic MHD equations are obtained from the kinetic equations for species (e.g., Toepfer 1971; Dzhavakhishvili & Tsintsadze 1973) and the form of Equations (5)-(7) is equivalent to equations for cosmic rays used in other papers (e.g., Sakai & Kawata 1980; Mikhailovskii et al. 1985; Mofiz & Khan 1993; Gratton et al. 1998; Haim 2009). It should be noted that in general the notation Tcr is considered not to be as the temperature, but as some typical internal energy of the cosmic-ray distribution. To avoid confusion, this notation could be changed via pcr. However, we retain it as it is given in (Lontano et al. 2001). The relativistic MHD equation (5) has a general form and can be also applied to nonrelativistic and relativistic fluid flows or beam particles (see, e.g., Toepfer 1971; Wallis et al. 1975; Hazeltine & Mahajan 2000; Haim 2009). We note that in the multifluid part of their paper (Appendix A), Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) have used the equation for cosmic rays (Equation (A1)) analogous to Equation (5) in the cold temperature regime with a beam velocity. We also note that the simple one-fluid MHD equations have been used by Sharma et al. (2009, 2010) to consider the influence of adiabatic cosmic rays with the diffusive energy flux on the buoyancy and thermal instabilities in galaxy clusters, correspondingly.

Equations (1)-(6) are solved together with Maxwell's equations

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula]. We note that Gauss' law for [formula] is automatically followed from Equation (8), and Gauss' law for [formula] is automatically obtained from Equations (2) and (9).

Zero order system state

It is known for a long time that a return current is induced in a plasma penetrated by an external beam current (Roberts & Bennett 1968). The return plasma current equal to the external one and directed oppositely arises due to self-consistent electromagnetic perturbations of plasma under the action of an external current (e.g., Cox & Bennett 1970; Hammer & Rostoker 1970; Berk & Pearlstein 1976). As a result, the condition of quasineutrality and the absence of the total current are maintained. In astrophysical plasmas, such external beam currents are cosmic-ray flows. In papers devoted to cosmic-ray streaming instabilities in the situation where drift velocities of plasma species and cosmic rays are directed along the background magnetic field (e.g., Achterberg 1983; Zweibel 2003; Bell 2004; Riquelmi & Spitkovsky 2009; Nekrasov 2013), it has been also assumed that to zeroth-order the system is of charge neutrality and there is no net current due to appearance of the plasma return current. Here, we consider other situation in which cosmic rays can drift across the background magnetic field. One such a possibility has been considered by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) for the upstream medium of supernova remnant shocks. It was shown that near the shock cosmic rays having the Larmor radius smaller than the length scale of pre-amplified, quasi-transverse magnetic field generated by the highest energy cosmic rays due to the Bell instability (Bell 2004), will produce a current perpendicular to the initial, pre-amplified field due to the coherent deflection in the homogeneous (large scale) magnetic field (see Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2010 for details). One can say that this perpendicular current arises due to the magnetic wall effect. Therefore, we would like to note that such a mechanism could also occur in other astrophysical environments where cosmic rays can encounter magnetic fields (clouds). Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations (Riquelme & Spitkovsky 2010) have confirmed the formation of the perpendicular mean cosmic-ray velocity ( at ~  c / 2).

As in the case of cosmic rays drifting along the magnetic field, one can also assume the generation of the return plasma current compensating the perpendicular cosmic-ray one. It can be shown that in the ideal model of Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010), we have an infinite sheet cosmic-ray current, which forms a homogeneous magnetic field parallel to the current plane and perpendicular to the current direction. In this case, the return current can be only produced by the time-dependent perpendicular electric field in the zero order state, in which plasma species experience a polarization drift across the magnetic field.

Let us find this electric field. We consider a uniform plasma embedded in the uniform magnetic field [formula],  [formula] is directed along the y-axis. From Equations (1) and (5), where we take into account the electric and polarization drifts of particles, and from Equation (9) without left-hand side and with account for the displacement current, one can find the time-dependent zero order electric field [formula] defined by

[formula]

where [formula] is the ion Alfvén velocity. The conditions ∂  /  ∂t  ≪  ωcj and Rcrγcr∂  /  ∂t  ≪  ωccr, where ωcj = qjB0 / mjc is the cyclotron frequency, and the condition of quasi-neutrality, qini0 + qene0 + qcrncr0 = 0 (the number density ncr is the one in the laboratory frame), have been used. The polarization drift of cosmic rays in Equation (10) has been omitted. This equation in the case c2  ≫  c2Ai has been given by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) without derivation. We note that at the absence of the background plasma ([formula] cAi  →    ∞   ), Equation (10) results in Maxwell's equation [formula] for the uniform magnetic field. Using Equation (10) in the limit c2  ≫  c2Ai, we find the return plasma current [formula] defined by the polarization drift of ions [formula]

[formula]

whose magnitude is equal to the cosmic-ray current and has the opposite direction. The polarization drift of electrons is not taken into account because of a small electron mass. In general, the zero order electric field [formula] cannot operates indefinitely. This field continues only during the action of cosmic rays. If we put, for convenience, [formula] [formula], where [formula] is the velocity of cosmic rays along the y-axis, then we obtain from Equation (11) that [formula]. Thus, upl  ≪  ucr because ncr0  ≪  ni0. Below, the plasma drift velocity [formula] will be also taken into account together with [formula].

Above in this Section, we have discussed a zero order state for a model considered by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) in which cosmic-ray and plasma return currents are perpendicular to the background magnetic field. However, perpendicular currents can also form due to other reasons. For example, cosmic rays and plasma charged species can drift across the magnetic field, which is inhomogeneous in the longitudinal and/or transverse directions, and in the presence of a perpendicular gravitational acceleration. In this case, we think, a return current cannot appear because cosmic rays are not an external agent penetrating a plasma. Further, the large energy cosmic rays having the Larmor radius much larger than inhomogeneities of magnetic force lines can result in a transverse current. It is possible that in this case the return current can arise. Also, diamagnetic drifts due to transverse pressure gradients produce transverse currents.

For simplicity, we further consider the case in which background temperatures of electrons and ions are equal each other, i.e. Te0 = Ti0 = T0. The case Te0  ≠  Ti0 for thermal instability has been considered, for instance, by Nekrasov (2011, 2012). Here, we will omit the perturbed terms [formula] [formula] in the temperature equations. However, to follow the symmetric contribution of ions and electrons in a convenient way, we make some calculations by assuming different temperatures. Then, thermal equations (3) and (4) in the background state take the form

[formula]

Wave equations

For perturbations across the background magnetic field when ∂  /  ∂z = 0, Equations (8) and (9) give us the following two equations:

[formula]

and

[formula]

where [formula] and the subscript 1 here and below denotes the perturbed values. The third equation describes the ordinary electromagnetic wave with [formula] and is split from Equations (13) and (14). The general expressions for the components jpl1x,y and jcr1x,y are given in the Appendices A and B (Equations (A54)-(A56) and (B19)-(B21)). These expressions are available for both magnetized and non-magnetized systems, electron-positron, pair-ion and dusty plasmas and so on. Besides, they include the radiation-condensation effects. In their general form, these expressions are very complicated. Therefore to proceed analytically, one must apply simplifying assumptions. We are interested in magnetized systems consisting of electrons, ions, and cosmic rays, in which cyclotron frequencies of species are much larger than the Doppler-shifted dynamical frequencies. In our case, this implies

[formula]

(see Equations (A5), (A8), and (B7)). As we have noted above, cosmic rays can be both protons and electrons. For ultrarelativistic cosmic rays, [formula], the second Equation (15) can be violated. Such a case in which cosmic rays become unmagnetized is not considered in this paper. We here assume also that the case Tcr  ≪  mcrc2 is satisfied, i.e. cosmic rays are cold. Another condition that simplifies the treatment considerably is to assume the wavelength of perturbations to be much larger than the thermal Larmor radius of particles ρj

[formula]

where [formula] and ρcr = cscr  /  ωccr (see Equations (A41) and (B11)). The additional conditions for cosmic rays simplifying their contribution to a current will be given below. The third simplification is to consider perturbations along and across the cosmic-ray velocity [formula] separately. The first case is simpler. Therefore, we begin with its consideration.

The case [formula]

Using Equation (A56) and performing calculations of the corresponding quantities, we find the components of the plasma dielectric permeability tensor (vi0y has been changed by upl)

[formula]

For obtaining Equation (17), we have taken into account that mi  ≫  me and ni0≃ne0. Analogously from Equation (B21), we obtain the cosmic-ray dielectric permeability tensor

[formula]

Here, we have used the additional condition for cosmic rays

[formula]

(see Equation (B11)). The term proportional to ucr / c2 in Equation (18) shows the contribution of γcr1 to the cosmic-ray pressure perturbation (see Equations (B8) and (B9)).

Wave equation

From Equations (13) and (14), using Equations (A54), (A55), (B19), and (B20) and omitting the contribution of the displacement current under conditon [formula], we obtain equation

[formula]

where εij  =  εplij  +  εcrij. The values εij are defined by Equations (17) and (18). When calculating the right-hand side of Equation (19), we assume some additional conditions except those given by Equations (15) and (16). We will neglect the contribution to εxyεyx of the thermal cosmic-ray term in εcrxy and εcryx. Besides, we will use the condition of quasineutrality in εxy and εyx and neglect the terms arising due to expansion of Ω- 2i,cr. An analysis shows that the corresponding conditions can be written in the form

[formula]

where [formula]. For simplicity, for writing these inequalities, we considered the terms, in which plasma frequencies ωpi and ωpcr are cancelled. In the term εxx, we used a cosmic-ray term in the main. According to Equations (16) and (20), the contribution of the term εxyεyx to Equation (19) is small. For example, an estimation shows (without thermal terms in Equation (18)) that εplxyεplyx  /  εplxxεplyy  ~   [formula] and εcrxyεcryx  /  εcrxxεcryy  ~   [formula] (see Equation (15)). Thus, we obtain the simple wave equation

[formula]

We note that for these perturbations E1y = 0 and B1x,y = 0, [formula].

Dispersion relation

Using Equations (17) and (18) to find εxx and accomplishing the Fourier transform in Equation (21), we find for perturbations of the form [formula] the following dispersion relation:

[formula]

Below, we consider solutions of Equation (22) for the streaming instability and an influence of the streaming and thermal pressure effects on the thermal instability.

Streaming instability

Let us set in Equation (22) all frequencies Ω equal to zero. To be more specific, it means that ω - kyupl  ≫  ΩT,ni,Ωε and ω  ≫  ΩT,ne,Ωε, where Ωie≃Ωei  =  Ωε (the frequencies Ω are defined by Equation (A12)). These conditions mean that we consider perturbations much faster than the typical time scales of thermal instability. Then, this equation takes the form

[formula]

The solution of Equation (23) is the following:

[formula]

where

[formula]

We see that the streaming instability has a threshold ucrth defined by the sound and ion Alfvén velocities

[formula]

When this threshold is exceeded, u2cr  ≫  u2crth, the growth rate δgr is given by

[formula]

These perturbations move with the phase velocity [formula]. We see that the induced plasma drift velocity upl does not affect on the growth rate because upl  ≪  ucr (see Equation (11)), but can contribute to the real part of the frequency.

Thermal instability

We now take into account the terms describing the thermal instability in Equation (22). We consider the fast thermal energy exchange regime in which Ωε  ≫  ∂  /  ∂t,ΩTi,e. Using Equations (A29) and (A30), we have

[formula]

where

[formula]

When obtaining Equation (28), we have assumed ω  ≪  kyucr that physically corresponds to the low frequency thermal instability in a comparison roughly with the streaming instability. If the right-hand side of Equation (28) is much less than unity, we obtain Field's isobaric solution 2ω = kyupl - iΩT,n  /  γ (Field 1965). These perturbations travel with the phase velocity upl / 2. In the opposite case, Equation (28) has the Parker's isochoric solution 2ω = kyupl - iΩT (Parker 1953). Thus, the presence of streaming cosmic rays can only change the kind of thermal instability, but not influence on its growth rates. When the right-hand side of Equation (28) is of the order of unity, the limiting solutions intermix.

The case [formula]

Calculating the components of the plasma dielectric permeability tensor given by Equation (A56), we obtain

[formula]

From Equation (B21) for cosmic rays, we have

[formula]

In this geometry, the additional simplifying condition for the cosmic-ray contribution except of Equation (16) follows from Equation (B11)

[formula]

We note that the terms εplxy(εplyx) and εcrxy(εcryx) contain here large terms ωciupl and ωccrucr, respectively.

Wave equation

In the case under consideration, the wave equation has the form

[formula]

Using Equations (29) and (30) and calculating the right-hand side of Equation (31), we find the simple expression for εxxεyy  -  εxyεyx

[formula]

In these perturbations, we have E1x = 0 and B1x,y = 0, B1z  ≠  0.

Dispersion relation

After Fourier transformation of Equation (31) and substitution of Equation (32), we derive the dispersion relation

[formula]

Below, as above, we consider the streaming instability and influence of cosmic rays on the thermal instability.

Streaming instability

As above, we again neglect in the values Gi,i = 1,2,3,4, and D all the frequencies Ω. Then, Equation (33) takes the form

[formula]

where we have omitted upl in comparison with ucr. This equation describes an aperiodic instability, if the velocity of cosmic rays exceeds the threshold given by Equation (26). The growth rate δgr when ucr exceeds ucrth is the following:

[formula]

Thermal instability

Now, we take into account the contribution into Equation (33) of terms describing the thermal instability in the fast thermal energy exchange regime Ωε  ≫  ∂  /  ∂t,ΩTi,e. The dispersion relation becomes

[formula]

This equation is analogous to Equation (28). Depending on whether the right-hand side of Equation (36) is much larger or smaller than unity, we will have the Parker (1953) or the Field (1965) instability.

Discussion and implications

We first discuss cosmic-ray streaming instabilities found above, which are a powerful source of magnetic amplification. The growth rates given by Equations (27) and (35) have in somewhat a similar form and increase with decreasing of the perturbation wavelength. The thresholds for the cases kx = 0, [formula] and [formula] ky = 0 are equal each other (see Equations (24) at ucr  ≫  upl and (34)). Thus, streaming cosmic rays generate perturbations in all directions across the ambient magnetic field. However, in the case of strongly relativistic cosmic rays when [formula] (the value d is defined by Equation (25)), the growth rate given by Equation (35) is [formula] times larger than that described by Equation (27) (for kx  ~  ky). A spectrum of perturbations in the [formula]-space is limited from above by Equations (15) and (16) and additional conditions (see inequalities after Equations (18) and (30)). For the case [formula], Equation (15) of magnetization can be written in the "soft" form

[formula]

where λy (λx below) is the wavelength along the y(x)-direction. We have assumed that the threshold of instability is exceeded. Equation (16) is the following: 1  ≫  k2yρ2i, γcr0k2yρ2ccr. The "soft" Equation (15) for the case [formula] is given by

[formula]

Equation (16) has the form 1  ≫  k2xρ2i, γ3cr0k2xρ2ccr. Inequalities after Equations (18) and (30) are satisfied. We see that the dependence of the right-hand sides of Equations (37) and (38) on d is different.

From Equations (28) and (36), it is followed that the relations between magnetohydrodynamical parameters of thermal plasma and cosmic rays and the perturbation wavelength determine the kind of thermal instability ranging from the Parker (1953) to the Field (1965) type instability. Thus in our model, the presence of streaming cosmic rays can only change the kind of thermal instability, but not influence on its growth rates. This conclusion is analogous to that in (Nekrasov & Shadmehri 2012). However, the right-hand sides of Equations (28) and (36) and in the corresponding equations of (Nekrasov & Shadmehri 2012) are quite different.

Let us now compare the growth rate for the streaming instability along the background magnetic field found by Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012) with the growth rates obtained in this paper. The growth rates given by Equations (27) and (35) are of the same order of magnitude, if [formula] or [formula] and [formula] (for the same wave numbers). In the case [formula] and [formula], the growth rate (35) is larger. Therefore, we use Equation (35) for a comparison. The maximal growth rate in (Nekrasov & Shadmehri 2012) is equal to

[formula]

where [formula]. The ratio of this growth rate to the growth rate (35) for the same cosmic-ray drift velocities is the following:

[formula]

Let cosmic rays be the protons. We estimate kx = kx max from Equation (38)

[formula]

Substituting this estimation into Equation (39) for the case [formula], we obtain

[formula]

Depending on parameters ucr, ncr0 and B0, this relation can be both less and larger then unity. In the opposite case, γcr0c2A  ≪  c2scr, Equation (39) takes the form

[formula]

We see that in this case the right-hand side of Equation (41) is smaller than that of Equation (40). Thus, transverse streaming instabilities induced by the cosmic-ray back-reaction can considerably contribute to turbulence of astrophysical objects and amplification of magnetic fields.

We now consider some specific values of the growth rates (27) and (35) for cosmic-ray protons in galaxy clusters. For the ICM, we take T0 = 3 keV and B0 = 1 μG. Then, we obtain [formula] s- 1 and cspl = 108 cm s- 1. In the case of weakly relativistic cosmic rays, ucr  ~  c and [formula], the parameter [formula]. Since ucr  ≫  cspl, the wave number ky is less than ωci / ucr  ~   [formula] cm- 1 (see Equation (37)). In the real case in which ncr0 / ni0  ≪  c2spl / u2cr, or [formula], the wave number kx is limited from above by ωci / cspl, or 10- 10 cm- 1. Thus, the upper estimations of the growth rates (27) and (35) are [formula] and [formula], respectively. These values are considerably larger than the Bell instability (Bell 2004). In the case of ultrarelativistic cosmic rays when [formula] but [formula], or γ- 3cr0 ≪  ncr0 / ni0  ≪  γ- 1cr0, we obtain [formula] and [formula] (see Equations (37) and (38)). Correspondingly, the limiting growth rates (27) and (35) are the same and equal to δgr  ~  γ- 2cr0ωci. We note that the last expression is independent from the density of cosmic rays. In the case [formula], or ncr0 / ni0  ≫  γ- 1cr0, the region of wavelengths of unstable perturbations in the y-direction and the growth rate remain the same as for the case [formula]. The wave numbers of the x-perturbations satisfy to [formula] and the corresponding growth rate is equal to δgr  ~  γ- 2cr0ωci as above. In the case [formula], or  ncr0 / ni0  ~  γ- 3cr0, the growth rates are the same in both cases and are equal to the last expression.

In Section 3, we have marked some other mechanisms of the appearance of perpendicular currents except of the model by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010). In general, the results for new instabilities obtained here do not change because we use in the equations of motion for species the cosmic-ray and plasma drift velocities [formula] and [formula], which are not specified for concrete mechanisms. The contribution of electron drifts will be negligible. The specific forms of values [formula] and [formula] will depend on the origin of the perpendicular current. In the case [formula], the return current of a plasma in dispersion relations (22) and (33) is not important.

In this paper, we for simplicity did not take into account the electron-ion collisions in the momentum equation (1). For perturbations across the magnetic field, the condition allowing to neglect this effect can be found in (Nekrasov 2012, Equation (34)) and has the form

[formula]

The presence of the ion drift velocity upl resulting in the Doppler shift (see Appendix A) does not influence on this condition because ω  ≫  kyupl for the streaming instability and [formula] for the thermal one (see Section 5.2). However, the collision frequency in the energy equation, Ωε = 2νie, is added to frequencies ∂  /  ∂t and ΩTi,e (see Equations (A29) and (A30)). Thus, the contributions to the dispersion relation of collisions in the momentum equation and in the energy equation are quite different. Therefore, the collisional energy exchange between electrons and ions is included in our analysis.

The model explored here with cosmic rays propagating across the ambient magnetic field has been considered by Bell (2005) (a general case) and have been applied by Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) for the problem of the magnetic field amplification in the upstream region of the supernova remnant shocks. However, streaming cosmic-ray driven instabilities can exist in a variety of environments. Therefore, we believe, wherever there is a cosmic-ray streaming, these instabilities may play a significant role. For example, the model described above can be applied to the ICM where cosmic rays are an important ingredient (Loewenstein et al. 1991; Guo & Oh 2008; Sharma et al. 2009; Sharma et al. 2010). Observations show that many cavities or bubbles in the ICM contain cosmic rays and magnetic fields (e.g., Guo & Oh 2008). A substantial amount of cosmic rays may escape from these buoyantly rising bubbles (Enß lin 2003), which could be disrupted by the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as they rise through the ICM (Fabian et al. 2006). Cosmic rays may also be produced by other processes near a central active galactic nucleus of the galaxy cluster. Structure formation shocks, merger shocks and supernovae may also inject cosmic rays into the ICM (e.g., Voelk et al. 1996; Berezinsky et al. 1997). Thus, various cosmic-ray streaming instabilities considered in particular in this paper can be a powerful source of generation of magnetic fields in astrophysical settings.

Conclusion

We have investigated streaming and thermal instabilities of astrophysical plasmas consisting of electrons, ions, and cosmic rays propagating across the background magnetic field. The drift velocity of cosmic rays can be relativistic, however their mean energy is assumed to be small (non-relativistic). The return current of the background plasma and the back-reaction of magnetized cosmic rays are taken into account. We have considered perturbations which are transverse to the background magnetic field and are along and across the cosmic-ray drift velocity. The case of perturbations along the magnetic field was treated by Nekrasov & Shadmehri (2012) where the growth rate due to the back-reaction of cosmic rays considerably larger than that obtained by Bell (2004, 2005) and Riquelme & Spitkovsky (2010) has been found. In the present case, we have shown that for sufficiently short-wavelength perturbations the growth rates obtained can in their turn exceed the growth rate found in (Nekrasov & Shadmehri 2012). This new result increases the role of cosmic-ray streaming instabilities in amplification of magnetic fields in astrophysical environments.

We have found that the thermal instability is not subject to the action of cosmic rays in the model under consideration. The dispersion relations derived for thermal instability include sound velocities of plasma and cosmic rays, Alfvén and cosmic-ray drift velocities. The relations between these parameters determine the kind of thermal instability ranging from the Parker (1953) to the Field (1965) type instability. However, the growth rates of thermal instabilities do not change.

The results of this paper can be applied to investigations of weakly collisional electron-ion astrophysical objects such as supernova remnant shocks, galaxy clusters and others, which include the dynamics of streaming cosmic rays.
