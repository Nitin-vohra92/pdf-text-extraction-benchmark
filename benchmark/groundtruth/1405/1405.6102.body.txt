Introduction

Schoen and Yau [\cite=sy] [\cite=sy2] proved that the ADM energy in general relativity is positive under reasonable assumptions about the energy-momentum tensor and metric tensor. The proof was simplified by Witten [\cite=w] and his work was amended by Nester [\cite=n]. Using Witten's method a similar result was obtained for the Trautman-Bondi energy E of a null surface [\cite=lv] [\cite=sy1] [\cite=hp] [\cite=in]. Recently Chruciel and Paetz [\cite=cp] presented a proof of the positivity of the Trautman-Bondi energy of a regular null cone in an asymptotically flat spacetime. This property was suggested earlier by the present author and Korbicz in a framework of the Hamiltonian formalism on a cone [\cite=kt]. However, paper [\cite=kt] contains a condition which is too restrictive if the cone is to be regular at its vertex. Here an amended version of our approach in [\cite=kt] is presented. In many respects it coincides with that in [\cite=cp], but some proofs and formulas are simpler.

We consider metric in the Bondi coordinates adapted to a foliation of spacetime by null cones, but instead of the luminosity distance we use the affine parameter along null generators of these cones. In section 2 we derive a formula for the Bondi mass aspect in terms of asymptotic data of the metric. In section 3 we express the total energy of a regular cone as an integral of quantities which are either non-negative or become such if the energy dominant condition is satisfied.

The Bondi mass aspect in the affine gauge

In the Bondi-Sachs approach to gravitational radiation [\cite=bbm] [\cite=s] spacetime is asymptotically flat in future null directions and it can be foliated by null surfaces u = const having the structure of the Minkowskian light cone, at least in the asymptotic region. In adapted coordinates xμ = u,r,xA, where μ = 0,1,2,3 and A = 2,3, metric takes the form

[formula]

Coordinates u and r are interpreted, respectively, as a retarded time and a distance from a center and xA are coordinates on the 2-dimensional sphere S2. We assume that g has the signature +  -  -  - , so metric gAB is negative definite. Note that g corresponds to [formula] in [\cite=kt].

Within this approach the following expansions are assumed for large values of coordinate r

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

[formula]

Here sAB is the standard metric of S2 and all coefficients are functions of u and xA. A lack of a term proportional to r- 1 in ([\ref=4a]) follows from minimal assumptions about the Ricci tensor which assure that the total energy-momentum vector is well defined [\cite=t].

Coordinate r is not yet fully defined. In the original Bondi coordinates it is the luminosity distance r' which satisfies

[formula]

where σ2  =   det gAB and σ2s  =   det sAB. Let quantities related to the Bondi coordinates be denoted by prime. Function M' is called the Bondi mass aspect and the total energy of the cone is given by

[formula]

In these coordinates sABn'AB = 0 and n'AB,u is equivalent to the Bondi news function (this is why we use letter n in the symbol nAB).

Unfortunately, the luminosity distance is not convenient for proving E  ≥  0. It is better to assume that

[formula]

In this case r is the affine parameter along null geodesics tangent to u,α∂α. A transformation between the luminosity distance r' and the affine distance r is defined up to a function a'(u,xA)

[formula]

If a'  ≠  0 then instead of ([\ref=4]) one obtains

[formula]

where a is a function of u and xA. A relation between M and the Bondi mass aspect M' is described by the following proposition in which ∂u is denoted by a dot.

Metric

[formula]

is equivalent to the Bondi-Sachs metric with the luminosity distance if it satisfies conditions ([\ref=6]), ([\ref=7]) and

[formula]

The Bondi mass aspect is given by

[formula]

If the Einstein equation R11 = T11 is satisfied then

[formula]

Given metric ([\ref=13a]) function g'00 and the Bondi mass aspect M' can be determined from the equality

[formula]

where primes correspond to the luminosity gauge. It follows from ([\ref=14]) that

[formula]

In virtue of ([\ref=1]) equation ([\ref=16]) yields

[formula]

From ([\ref=7]) and ([\ref=1]) one obtains

[formula]

for large values of r. One consequence of ([\ref=17]), ([\ref=18]) and condition ([\ref=4]) for g'00 is equation ([\ref=18a]). Another one is that the Bondi mass aspect is given by

[formula]

or, equivalently, by

[formula]

where

[formula]

Expression ([\ref=18b]) will be useful in a proof of E  ≥  0 in the next section. In order to obtain ([\ref=18g]) we calculate one more term in expansions ([\ref=18])

[formula]

where

[formula]

It follows from ([\ref=18b])-([\ref=18d]) that

[formula]

hence ([\ref=18g]) is obtained. One can further transform this expression if the Einstein equation R11 = T11 (see ([\ref=19])) is satisfied. Expanding both sides of this equation into powers of r- 1 yields ([\ref=18f]) as the first nontrivial equality.

In order to eliminate mA A from ([\ref=18g]) one can use ([\ref=18f]) or the equality

[formula]

which follows from the Einstein equation R01 = T01 - T / 2.

Formulas given in this section agree with those in [\cite=kt] if Tμν = 0 and nA A = 0. The latter condition can be obtained by a shift of the affine distance. However, assumption nA A = 0 is too restrictive (as pointed out by P. Chruciel) if a regular foliation of the complete cone u = const by surfaces r = const is considered in order to prove E  ≥  0.

The total energy of a light cone

Let us assume that metric satisfies conditions ([\ref=3])-([\ref=7]) and u = const is a complete future cone with a vertex at r = 0. For our purposes the following regularity conditions at the vertex are important

[formula]

These conditions are preserved if we pass to the luminosity distance r' or to the affine distance provided that the latter vanishes at the vertex.

We are going to prove the following proposition which, to big extent, overlaps with equation (31) in [\cite=cp] and its consequence saying that E  ≥  0 (mTB  ≥  0 in the notation of [\cite=cp]) if the dominant energy condition is satisfied. The proof of this proposition is based on equations and method presented by the author and Korbicz in [\cite=kt].

Let metric ([\ref=13a]) satisfies conditions ([\ref=6]), ([\ref=7]), ([\ref=18a]), ([\ref=2]) and the Einstein equations R11 = T11 and gABRAB = gABTAB - T. Then

[formula]

where ĝAB = r- 2gAB. If the dominant energy condition is satisfied then E  ≥  0.

The Einstein equations mentioned above have the following form

[formula]

[formula]

Here [formula] is the covariant derivative with respect to gAB, R(2) is the Ricci scalar of this metric, Tμν is the energy-momentum tensor and T = Tμ μ. Equations ([\ref=19]) and ([\ref=20]) reduce to equations (29) and (32) in [\cite=kt] if Tμν = 0.

Let us integrate equation ([\ref=20]) over a part of the cone u = const between r1 and r2 with the measure σdx2dx3dr. Integrals of divergences of ωA and ωA ,r vanish. The Gauss-Bonet theorem for the negative definite metric gAB yields

[formula]

and it allows to replace R(2)σ by - 2(σsr),r. Hence,

[formula]

where

[formula]

and

[formula]

(definition ([\ref=24]) coincides with (50) in [\cite=kt]). Function [formula] vanishes at r = 0 in virtue of conditions ([\ref=2]). Since g11  =  ωAωA - g00, [formula] can be approximated by function ([\ref=18j]) for large values of r. In virtue of ([\ref=18b]) equation ([\ref=22]) in the limit r1  →  0 and r2  →    ∞   yields the following expression for the total energy

[formula]

Equation ([\ref=25]) agrees with (48) in [\cite=kt] if nA A = Tμν = 0.

In order to find sufficient conditions which assure that the first term on the rhs of ([\ref=25]) is non-negative let us write equation ([\ref=19]) in the following way

[formula]

where gAB = r2ĝAB and σ = r2σ̂. From ([\ref=18]) and ([\ref=2]) one obtains

[formula]

Hence, integrating ([\ref=26]) over r between 0 and ∞   yields

[formula]

Substituting ([\ref=23]) and ([\ref=28]) into ([\ref=25]) yields ([\ref=25c]). Since

[formula]

condition T11  ≥  0 is sufficient to obtain nA A  ≥  0.

Let us consider the integral of P on the rhs of ([\ref=25]). Since gABωA ,rωB ,r  ≤  0, in order to obtain P  ≥  0 it is sufficient to assure positivity of the expression

[formula]

where

[formula]

Let ωAωA  ≠  0. Then v is timelike and future directed since ∂r is null future directed and g(v,∂r) > 0. If Tαβ satisfies the dominant energy condition then vector v' = Tα βvβ∂α is non-spacelike and g(v',v)  ≥  0. Hence, v' is also future directed and T0 βvβ = g(v',∂r)  ≥  0. If ωAωA  =  0 then the same result follows from the continuity. Thus, T - gABTAB  ≥  0 and P  ≥  0.

If the energy dominant condition is satisfied then also T11  ≥  0 since T11 = Tαβkαkβ, where k = ∂r. Hence, nA A  ≥  0 and the total energy E is non-negative.

Concluding remarks

Results of Korbicz and Tafel [\cite=kt] on energy of a null surface in the Bondi-Sachs formalism have been completed. We presented an expression for the Bondi mass aspect in terms of asymptotical data corresponding to metric in the affine gauge (proposition 2.1). Using only two of the Einstein equations we confirmed a result of Chruciel and Paetz [\cite=cp] on the positivity of the Trautman-Bondi energy of a regular null cone (proposition 3.1). Our proof is shorter and expression ([\ref=25c]) for the total energy is simpler than that in [\cite=cp].
