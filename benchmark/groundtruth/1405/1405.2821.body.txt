Quantum dot opto-mechanics in a fully self-assembled nanowire

Experiments on micro- and nanomechanical oscillators are now addressing what were once purely theoretical questions: the initialization, control, and read-out of the quantum state of a mechanical oscillator. Researchers are able both to initialize the fundamental vibrational mode of a mechanical resonator into its ground state[\cite=Teufel] [\cite=Chan] and even to produce non-classical coherent states of motion[\cite=OConnell]. The prospects are bright for exploiting these achievements to produce mechanical sensors whose sensitivity is limited only by quantum effects or to use a mechanical state to encode quantum information. The ability to initialize and observe the quantization of mechanical motion is particularly noteworthy not only from a fundamental point of view, but also because mechanical oscillators are excellent transducers. By functionalizing a resonator with an electrode, magnet, or mirror, mechanical motion can be transformed into the modulation of electric, magnetic, or optical fields[\cite=Treutlein]. The ease of this process has inspired proposals to use mechanical resonators as quantum transducers, mediating interactions between different quantum systems[\cite=Rabl] [\cite=Kolkowitz] [\cite=McGee] [\cite=Palomaki]. Furthermore, such couplings have now been demonstrated in a variety of quantum systems including optical[\cite=Anetsberger] and microwave[\cite=Bochmann] cavities, superconducting devices[\cite=Armour], laser-cooled atoms[\cite=Camerer], quantum dots[\cite=Yeo] and nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond[\cite=Arcizet] [\cite=Teissier] [\cite=Jayich]. In most cases, however, the functionalization of the mechanical oscillator with a coupling element competes with the requirement of a small resonator mass, required for achieving a high coupling strength[\cite=Treutlein]. Moreover, the functionalization process often adds additional paths of dissipation and decoherence, reducing the lifetime of the coupled quantum system, or "hybrid" system.

In this letter, we report on the coupling of a nanomechanical oscillator with controllable quantum states, in which both the coupling interaction and the quantum states themselves are intrinsic to the oscillator's structure. Not only is the strength of this coupling unusually strong, but its "built-in" nature produces a hybrid system whose inherent coherence is unspoiled by external functionalization and whose fabrication is simpler than top-down techniques. The specific nanoresonator that we study is a bottom-up GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowire (NW) containing optically-active self-assembled quantum dots (QDs)[\cite=Heiss]. These QDs have been shown to emit narrow optical linewidth (down to 29 Î¼eV) single photons with high brightness (count rates in the MHz range) [\cite=Heiss]. Here we show that their energy levels are coupled to the mechanical vibrations of the NW through intrinsic material strain. We demonstrate that mechanical motion allows a reversible tuning of the QD optical frequency with no measurable influence on its photoluminescence intensity.

Our quantum-dot-in-nanowire structures are fully self-assembled by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). As shown in Fig. [\ref=f:setup](a), the QDs form at the apex of the GaAs/AlGaAs interface, in Al-poor regions embedded in the Al-rich corners of the NW hexagonal cross-section. By controlling the overall diameter of core and shell during growth, it is possible to position the QDs within a few nanometers of the NW surface. This proximity to the surface allows for the optimal coupling of the QDs to the strain in the NW (Fig. [\ref=f:setup](b)). Despite their position near the surface, these QDs retain their high optical quality, making them ideal for sensing applications. The NWs studied here have a predominantly Zinc-Blende crystalline structure and display a regular hexagonal cross-section. The synthesis starts with a 290-nm thick NW core, grown along
