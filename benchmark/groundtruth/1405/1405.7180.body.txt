Introduction

T Tauri stars (TTSs) are young and low-mass ([formula] M[formula]) pre-main sequence stars with strong and complex magnetic fields and a surrounding disc that is truncated near the corotation radius by interaction with the magnetic field. From the observational point of view TTSs are split into two main groups: Classical TTSs (CTTSs) and Weak lined TTSs (WTTSs). CTTSs are accreting mass from the disc whereas WTTSs have no or very little spectral signatures of accretion. The material in the inner part of the disc is ionized by the stellar radiation and channelled through the magnetic field lines [\citep=uchida1984] [\citep=koenigl1991]. The gas from the disc is accelerated to almost free-fall velocity before it reaches the stellar surface forming an accretion shock [\citep=bouvier2007] [\citep=aig2013a]. Detailed simulations of the interaction between the stellar field and the inner disc show a complex dynamics of the magnetospheric flow that depends on the field properties and its stability [\citep=romanova2012] [\citep=kurosawa2013]. Some analytical expressions for the hotspot shapes and the magnetospheric radius have been provided by [\citet=kulkarni2013].

The interaction between the star, disc and magnetic field produces an excess emission at different wavelengths that affects the evolution of the disc itself and the circumstellar environment. The atmospheric and magnetospheric energy output is released mainly in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral range. Thus, there is a relatively large number of spectral features in the UV that can be used as potential tracers of the physical conditions in TTS. Different emission lines in the UV wavelength range provide different information about the regions in which they are formed, the involved physical processes and the system geometry. For example, the Mg II resonance doublet at 2795.5 and 2802.7 Å is produced in the chromosphere of TTS and it is one of the strongest features in UV spectra of TTS. Mg II is sensitive to, and can be used as a good tracer of, atmosphere and outflow/wind in TTS [\citep=ardila2002b] [\citep=calvet2004] [\citep=ingleby2013]. N V, C IV, He II and Si IV are good tracers of hot gas and accretion processes in TTSs. The relationship between these lines and mass accretion in TTSs has been already studied by different authors [\citep=johnskrull2000] [\citep=ardila2002a] [\citep=ingleby2011] [\citep=yang2012] [\citep=aig2012] [\citep=ardila2013] [\citep=aig2013b].

The semiforbidden lines of the C II] quintuplet (wavelengths: 2324.21, 2325.4, 2326.11, 2327.64, 2328.83 Å) are not observed in WTTSs; however, they are readily detected in CTTSs, even in low mass accretors [\citep=lamzin2000]. This multiplet seems to be a very sensitive tracer of accretion or outflows [\citep=calvet2004] [\citep=aig2005] [\citep=ingleby2013]. [\citet=calvet2004] and [\citet=ingleby2013] analysed these lines in low resolution spectra and found a relationship between the C II] luminosity and the accretion luminosity. The study of the C II] flux ratios within a small range of wavelengths provides a good opportunity to investigate TTS properties because they are optically thin and their ratios do not depend on the geometry of the accretion system and are only slightly affected by the large uncertainties associated with extinction determination. It is known that the relative intensities of the emission lines of the C II] multiplet are sensitive to the electron density in the range [formula] cm- 3 [\citep=stencel1981] [\citep=hayes1984a] [\citep=hayes1984b] [\citep=keenan1986]. Plasma in the magnetospheres and atmospheres of CTTSs is within this density range. However, line blending makes it difficult to identify the individual features and to measure the lines ratios [\citep=lamzin2000] [\citep=kravtsova2002].

In this work, we present for the first time a study of C II] line ratios in a sample of 20 CTTSs using 30 medium-resolution spectra. We found the best-fitting spectrum to the data using a grid of simulated profiles computed for a broad range of electron densities and temperatures. The log of observations, the characteristics of the CTTSs sample and the profiles are described in Section [\ref=sample]. The numerical method used to derive the individual lines fluxes and the properties of the radiating plasma is presented in Section [\ref=plasma], that also includes the limitations of the method and the final results. In Section 4, we present the plasma properties obtained with our procedure and they are compared with the accretion rates derived from [\citet=ingleby2013]. To conclude, in Section 5, we provide a brief summary of the main results.

The C II] profile of CTTSs

Our sample consists of the 27 CTTSs observed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST); no C II] emission is detected in WTTSs. Most of the sources (17 of 27) are located in Taurus-Auriga Molecular Cloud. The rest of the sources are in η Chamaleon (2), ε Chamaleon (1), Chamaleon I (2), TW Hydra Association (2), Orion (1) and Upper Scorpius (1). DK Tau, HN Tau [\citep=correia2006], CV Cha [\citep=bary2008] and UX Tau [\citep=nguyen2012] are binaries with companions at distances of 2.304, 3.109, 11.4 and 5.9 arcsec, respectively, that are resolved by STIS. T Tau [\citep=furlan2006], FU Ori [\citep=wang2004] and DF tau [\citep=unruh1998] are close binaries at distances 0.7, 0.5 and 0.09 arcsec, respectively. CS Cha is a spectroscopic binary [\citep=guenther2007]. Several stars show evidence of transitional discs, but they are still accreting: CS Cha, DM Tau, GM Aur, TW Hya and UX Tau [\citep=espaillat2010]. In some sources of our sample jets/outflows have been detected: RY Tau [\citep=stonge2008], DG Tau [\citep=coffey2008], T Tau [\citep=furlan2006], SZ 102 [\citep=comeron2011], AA Tau, DF Tau, HN Tau and SU Aur [\citep=howard2013].

The sample is formed of 42 medium-resolution (R≃30000) spectra obtained with grating E230M; the log of data is provided in Table [\ref=tab1]. We have selected spectra with signal-to-noise-ratio (S/N) > 2; the S/N has been calculated over the whole feature as described in Section 3.3. The spectra are shown in Fig. [\ref=f1]. No significant variations are detected in the spectrum of sources with multiple observations, except for DS Tau (see Appendix A); note that though the C II] flux of DS Tau drops by a factor of 2 between two observations, no significant profile shape variations are noticeable.

In Fig.[\ref=f2], the main spectral features in the 2324-2336 Å range are indicated on the spectrum of TW Hya, the star with the best S/N in the sample. Note that the C II] multiplet is resolved. Additional relevant features in the range are:

The Fe II] lines at 2328.11 and 2333.52 Å (3d6( 5D)4s - 3d6( 5D)4p). Note that the 2328.11 Å transition is blended with the C II] lines in most spectra.

The Fe II] lines at 2332.02 and 2333.52 Å .

The Si II] multiplet at 2329.23, 2335.12 and 2335.32 Å.

Measuring the plasma properties

C II], Fe II] and Si II] features are intercombination transitions with very small Einstein coefficients and thus, optically thin tracers of the radiating plasma, suitable to be used to measure directly their properties. This characteristic was already noticed by [\cite=stencel1981] for C II] lines, who proposed to use them as electron density tracers in the 107   ≤   ne   ≤  1010.5 cm- 3 range in nebulae research. In Fig.[\ref=ratioscii], we display the sensitivity of the line ratios to Te and ne for this quintuplet. The plot was made by using the Atomic Database for Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Astrophysical Plasmas CHIANTI [\citep=dere1997] [\citep=landi2013]. Note that below ne  ≤  108 cm~  - 3, the ratios are insensitive to the electron density except for very diffuse plasmas with [formula] cm~  - 3. Therefore, other species need to be considered to constrain the Te of the plasma and the density for [formula] cm~  - 3 and [formula] cm~  - 3. The Fe II] ratios are sensitive to the electron density for [formula] cm- 3 (see top panel in Fig.[\ref=ratios]), the range of densities for which the C II] quintuplet ratios are nearly constant. The Si II] ratios are more sensitive to the temperature, particularly for [formula] K (see bottom panel in Fig.[\ref=ratios]). The combined analysis of all these ratios yields enough information to determine unambiguously the physical properties of the region where the lines are formed. For the calculations, we have assumed that all the lines are optically thin and formed via collisional excitation in a single plasma characterized by a pair (ne,Te). CHIANTI provides the ion emissivities (erg s- 1): εij  =  ΔE  (nj(XII) / n(XII))  Aji, being ΔE the difference of energies between levels j and i, nj(XII) / n(XII) the fraction of ions lying in the state j and Aji the spontaneous radiative transition probability. The emissivities per unit volume (erg s- 1 cm- 3) for a given ion X II have been calculated as:

[formula]

where nj(XII) is the number density of the specie X II in the upper level (j), n(XII) / n(X) is the ionization fraction of X and n(X) / n(H) is the abundance of element X. Solar metallicity is assumed. n(H) / ne  =  0.83 has been used since Te  >  104 K (see CHIANTI manual).

The numerical method

Making use of the emissivities from CHIANTI, we have computed the flux ratios relative to the C II] (2326.11 Å ) line of the following lines: C II]( 2324.21, 2325.4, 2327.64 and 2328.83 Å ), Fe II] (2328.11 and 2333.52 Å), Fe II] (2332.02 Å) and Si II] (2329.23, 2335.12 and 2335.32 Å), for a grid of electron temperatures and densities. The grid covers the range 4.0  ≤   log Te(K)  ≤  5.5 and 0.0  ≤   log ne(cm- 3)  ≤  14.5 with resolutions 0.025 dex in log (Te) and 0.25 dex in log (ne). We have assumed that the lines profiles are adequately reproduced by Gaussian functions. In this manner, we have built a grid of simulated spectra in the 2323-2338 Å spectral range given by

[formula]

where F0 is the peak flux of the reference line (C II]2326), Ri = Fi / F0 is the flux ratio between the peak of the ith line and F0, σ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian functions and λi is the central wavelength of the ith emission line (which can be shifted δ Å from its expected position). Fcont is directly computed from the observations as the average flux in the 2320-2323 Å range for each spectra; this is a featureless window (see Fig.[\ref=f1]). Both dispersion (σ) and shift (δ) are assumed to be the same for all lines.

We developed an IDL based code to identify the synthetic spectrum that best fit the data consisting in two main steps. First, for each synthetic spectrum - defined by a pair (ne, Te) - the best fit to the data is found by a least squares scheme that leaves F0, δ and σ as free parameters for the fit. As a result, for any given model i (ne,i, Te,i), the set of parameters that best fit the data (F0,i,σi,δi), as well as the residuals, χ2i, are computed. This allows plotting the χ2 surface in the (ne, Te) space (see Fig.[\ref=chi]). Then, the minimum of the surface is identified providing the (ne,Te) pair that best fit the data. This minimum corresponds to the optimal fit, i.e. χ2opt  =   min(χ2). In Table [\ref=tab3], the ne,Te,σ,δ values corresponding to the best-fitting model are provided for all the TTSs in the study. Initial conditions for the free parameters are set as follows: σ0  =  0.1 Å (approximately equivalent to the combination of the spectral resolution obtained with STIS/E230M and thermal broadening), F0 is set as the peak flux around 2326 Å and δ0 is such that F(2326.11 - δ0) = F0 in the observed spectrum. We performed several tests to check the dependence of the results on the initial values of the free parameters. By varying these initial values, the final solution (χ2opt) never differed by more than one step in the grid of Te and ne values. This means that the steps of the grid represent the internal precision of the fitting procedure (δ log Te(K)≃0.025 and δ log ne(cm- 3)≃0.25); they are the same for all stars in the sample.

From the fitting procedure, we also estimated the uncertainties associated to δ, σ and each line flux. For this, we selected the eight closest grid points to the best fit (the local minimum) and we calculated the standard deviation from the average value using these eight points. The standard deviations in δ is always [formula] km s- 1, whereas in σ is [formula] km s- 1. These uncertainties are not provided in Table [\ref=tab3] because they are negligible. The final simulated fluxes with their associated errors are shown in Table [\ref=tab4].

The Fe II]2332.02 line has not been considered for the fit. We have found a large discrepancy between CHIANTI predictions for the line strength (ε(2332.02)  ~  0.06  ·  ε(2333.52)) and the observations, where both Fe II lines have comparable strengths (see Fig.[\ref=f2]).

Fig.[\ref=f6] shows two illustrative examples of the results of the fitting procedure. The targets selected are TW Hya, with high S/N and DE Tau with low S/N. The difference in S/N is readily observed in the χ2 surface (see Fig.[\ref=chi]); the height of the surface above the (ne,Te) plane increases as the S/N decreases. However both surfaces share some common characteristics: (1) a steep rise of the χ2 surface towards low Te and low ne and (2) there is always a narrow range of (ne,Te) that gives the best statistical fits to the original data (see the projected contours of the χ2 surfaces on the ne,Te plane in Fig.[\ref=chi]).

(ne,Te) in the line emission region

Fig.[\ref=tene] shows the electron densities and temperatures corresponding to the optimal fits. For stars with multiple observations, only the best-fitting (with the minimum χ2opt) results are plotted. The differences among observations are small having very similar results in most of the cases (see Table [\ref=tab3]).

Most sources are grouped in a region with [formula] and [formula]. There are three stars outside this region: DR Tau, AA Tau and SZ 102. DR Tau converged to values lying very close to the limits of the ne - Te grid. In the case of SZ 102, the low density probably indicates that the C II] emission is dominated by an extended ionized envelope. Something similar might be occurring in AA Tau, a CTTS with a warped disc [\citep=menard2003] that displays very peculiar profiles in the UV emission lines [\citep=france2012] [\citep=ardila2013] [\citep=aig2013b]. These three stars are represented in the figure as filled circles. These "unusual" values lead us to think that maybe the C II], Fe II] and Si II] lines are not formed under the same physical conditions as the other sources. Therefore, these three stars are excluded from the following analysis.

Consistency tests

For this purpose, we have compared the observed flux in the C II] feature with the flux derived from the best fitting model for each target - including the C II] quintuplet and the unresolved Fe II]2328.1 and Si II]2329.23 lines.

The observed flux has been measured in the range 2324-2330 Å as Fobs  =  (f - NpixFcont)Δλ, where Fcont is the continuum average flux, Npix is the number of pixels in the selected window (151 pixels), f is the wavelength-integrated line flux and Δλ the step in wavelength (0.04 Å). We also estimated the corresponding flux error as δF  =  Npix  ·  Δλ  ·  σcont (being σcont the dispersion around this average). The continuum was measured in the 2320-2323 Å spectral range.

The simulated flux of each line has been calculated as the integral of the Gaussian function fitting that line. Table [\ref=tab4] shows the fluxes for each line. The total flux of the C II] quintuplet has been calculated from the best-fitting models as

[formula]

The Si II]2335 flux is the sum of the components at 2335.12 and 2335.52 Å since they are not resolved in the HST/STIS spectra.

The comparison between observed and fitted flux is shown in Fig.[\ref=obssimsnr]. Most of the observed fluxes are slightly higher than the simulated ones but the discrepancy is well within the expected value given the S/N of the data. TW Hya shows the largest discrepancy that we interpret as a result of the simplicity of the modelling, i. e. the difficulties to fit the data to a "single plasma" emission. In this sense, we would like to remark that the (ne,Te) values in Table [\ref=tab3] should be understood as average values on the plasma emission region.

We have also calculated the contribution of the Fe II]2328 and Si II]2329 fluxes to the 2326 Å feature, unresolved in most of the TTSs spectra. From the simulated spectra, we have found that Fe II]2328 emission can account for up to ~  15 per cent of the flux, whereas Si II]2329 contribution is negligible ([formula] per cent ).

Line ratios as Te and ne indicators

The C II]/Si II] flux ratio is a sensitive tracer of the electron temperature in the range of interest. As it is shown in Fig.[\ref=ciisiite], Te is basically derived from this ratio in our code. The regression line in Fig.[\ref=ciisiite] has a Pearson's coefficient of r = 0.91 with a p  -  value = 4.8  ×  10- 7. The regression equation is:

[formula]

We have not found any significant correlation between C II]/Fe II]2333 flux ratio and the temperature.

Regarding electron density, we have recovered the expected relation between ne and the C II]/Fe II]2333 and Si II]/Fe II]2333 ratios. The regression parameters are:

For C II]/Fe II]2333: r =  - 0.6 and p  -  value = 0.015

For Si II]/Fe II]2333: r =  - 0.9, p  -  value = 8.34  ×  10- 7 and regression equation: log (F(SiII]) / F(FeII]))  =  ( - 0.25  ±  0.03)   log (ne)  +  (3.02  ±  0.32), as shown in Fig.[\ref=siifeiine].

C II] as an accretion tracer

The C II] quintuplet have been found to be a good tracer of the accretion rate [\citep=calvet2004] [\citep=ingleby2013]. In this section, we discuss this point as well as the relationship between the obtained results, (ne, Te, σ) and accretion rate ([formula]).

Dispersion versus electron temperature

Further insight on the source of the profile broadening can be drawn from Fig.[\ref=sigmatene]. The line dispersions that best fit the observed spectra are shown in Table [\ref=tab3] and they are in the range [formula] km s- 1. TW Hya and CY Tau have σ  <  25 km s- 1 and high Te values (log Te(K)≃4.4 - 4.5). For these stars the line broadening is consistent with thermal broadening (vth  ~  22 km s- 1). SU Aur is the source with the largest line broadening, σ  >  100 km s- 1, and a temperature of Te≃104.3 K. This star is the fastest rotator in the sample (v   sin i  ~  60 km s- 1) thus, rotation could be an important source of line broadening. The rest of the stars have intermediate σ values ([formula] km s- 1) and temperatures in the range log Te(K)≃4.1 - 4.45. The dispersions are suprathermal and the contribution of rotational broadening is negligible since with v   sin i values are in the range ~  5 - 25 km s- 1 (see Table [\ref=biblio]). There is a mild correlation between σ and Te, as shown in Fig.[\ref=sigmatene] (r =  - 0.6 and a p  -  value = 0.018).

Dispersion versus accretion rate

We have also examined the relation between dispersion, σ and accretion rate, [formula]. As shown in Fig.[\ref=sigmamacr], TTSs show a statistically significant correlation between σ and [formula]: the higher the accretion rate the wider the line. Note that there is a small group of TTSs (TWA 3A, RECX 11, RECX 15 and PDS 66) with [formula] M[formula] yr- 1, that seem to have too low accretion rates for the given dispersion. PDS 66 also displays an unusually high C II] flux for the accretion rate derived by [\citet=ingleby2013]. For this reason these stars have not been considered to determine the correlation coefficient. The Pearson's coefficient is r = 0.87 with a p  -  value = 0.0002. This trend suggests a clear connection between the region in which lines are formed and the accretion process and agrees with those trends reported recently for other UV spectral tracers [\citep=ardila2013] [\citep=aig2013b].

C II] luminosity versus accretion rate

Here we re-examine the correlation reported by [\citet=ingleby2013] from low-dispersion data between the accretion rate/luminosity and the C II] flux. Fluxes are extinction corrected according to [\citet=valencic2004] assuming RV = 3.1 (see Table [\ref=biblio] for a compilation of the AV values and distances used in the calculation, as well as other relevant parameters). The extinction AV is one of the major sources of uncertainty affecting, among other things, the accretion rate estimates. For this reason, extinctions have been selected mainly from the same source than the accretion rates [\citep=ingleby2013]. As a test, we have repeated the analysis with data from [\citet=ardila2013], and found the same general trend. As shown in Fig.[\ref=ciiavmacr], the C II] luminosity increases as the accretion rate does:

[formula]

with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.83 (p  -  value = 0.0008). This correlation is for stars with [formula] M[formula] yr- 1. For comparison, [\citet=ingleby2013] obtain a slope ≃0.9  ±  0.2 from low-dispersion data.

Electron density versus accretion rate

In Fig.[\ref=nemacr] we have plotted the electron density as a function of the accretion rate. TWA 3A, RECX 11, RECX 15 and PDS 66 have again a peculiar behaviour related with their, apparently, too low accretion rates when compared with the observed electron density in the emission region. There are four stars (TW Hya, CY Tau, GM Aur and DF Tau) with ne  >  1011 cm- 3. There seems to be a trend for ne to increase as the accretion rate does it (r = 0.92 and a p  -  value = 0.001) in sources with [formula] cm- 3 and [formula] (M[formula] yr- 1).

Blueshifted profiles

The shift of the lines, δ, obtained from the fitting, was corrected to the stellar rest frame and it is provided in Table [\ref=tab3]; the radial velocities of the TTSs are compiled in Table [\ref=biblio]. Note that the pointing errors in the STIS data result in a velocity uncertainty of 3 km s- 1, negligible for the purpose of this work. Most TTSs satisfy [formula] km s- 1; however, there are three stars namely, DG Tau, FU Ori and RY Tau with clearly blueshifted emission at velocities of -81.5, -73.5 and -47.1 km s- 1, respectively. This blueshift indicates a contribution from the unresolved base of the jet.

Conclusions

In this work, we have studied the semiforbidden lines of C II], Si II] and Fe II] in the 2310-2340 Å spectral range for a sample of 20 TTSs using 30 medium resolution spectra obtained with HST/STIS instrument.

As the lines are blended in a broad feature in most sources, we have developed a numerical method to determine the properties of the line emission region assuming that the radiating plasma can be characterized by a single Te and ne pair, considering solar abundances. This is the first work where ne and Te has been determined for such a large sample of TTSs; previous works dealt with much smaller samples [\citep=aig2001] [\citep=aig2003].

In magnetospheric accretion, matter flows from the inner border of the circumstellar disc on the magnetospheric surface to finally fall on to the star. Near the stellar surface a dense and hot shock is formed producing hot spots. The sheared magnetosphere-disc boundary layer is expected to be very prone to the development of turbulent flows.

Within this overall picture there are four issues worth remarking.

In most TTSs, the C II], Si II] and Fe II] radiation seems to be produced in an extended magnetospheric structure characterized by [formula] cm- 3 and [formula] K. The line broadening is suprathermal except for two stars (TW Hya and CY Tau). The dispersion depends on the electron temperature of the radiating plasma and on the accretion rate, suggesting a connection between the line formation region and the accretion process. This is consistent with the line radiation being dominated by the magnetospheric accretion flow, close to the disc. For TW Hya and CY Tau, the densities and temperatures are higher than for the rest of the stars and similar to the observed in atmospheres of cool stars [\citep=brown1984] [\citep=brooks2001]. Also, the line broadening is thermal. Therefore, the observed emission lines in TW Hya and CY Tau are formed in a different region in the magnetospheric accretion flow (likely close to the star). In good agreement with this picture, the density and temperature in the line formation region are below the theoretical predictions for the density and temperature in the accretion shock (ne≃1013 cm- 3 and Te≃106 K) and about the densities and temperatures expected in the funnel flow [\citep=calvet1998] [\citep=muzerolle2001].

There are three sources, DG Tau, FU Ori and RY Tau with blueshifted lines centroid. DG Tau and RY Tau have resolved jets and FU Ori has a strong wind. The large blueshifted velocities in these stars can be due to the contribution of the outflows to the C II] lines, suggesting that the properties in the base of the outflow are similar to those in the base of the accretion stream. The electron densities of the jet sources derived from the C II], Si II] and Fe II] lines agree well with previous estimates of electron densities at the base of the jet [\citep=aig2001] [\citep=aig2003] [\citep=aig2007]. The observations agree with the predictions of hot disc winds [\citep=aig2005]. From the theoretical point of view, it is expected that both, the base of the jet and the foot-point of the accretion flow, share similar physical conditions [\citep=mohanty2008].

The C II] quintuplet can be used as a reliable tracer of the mass accretion rate on the star. C II] luminosity increases as the accretion rate does it in agreement with previous results by [\citet=calvet2004] [\citet=ingleby2013].

Variability of the C II] profiles

Significant variations in the C II] profiles are only found in DS Tau (see Fig.[\ref=varprof1]). In this section, we include the figures showing the variability of the C II] profiles in TTSs. Only observations with S/N> 2 are compared.
