Stable regions of Turán expressions

Introduction

Given a sequence of polynomials P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0, with degree deg (Pk) = k, we adopt the notation

[formula]

for the k-th Turán expression.

Let D = ∂  /  ∂x and [formula] throughout. A polynomial in [formula] is called weakly Hurwitz stable if it is non-zero in the right half-plane [formula]. Our investigation is motivated, in part, by a problem proposed by S. Fisk.

Let B  =  {Bk(x)}∞k = 0, where Bk is the k-th univariate Bell polynomial given by the recurrence

[formula]

with initial value B0(x)  =  1. Then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable for [formula].

Problem [\ref=fisk-conjecture] concerns the univariate Bell polynomials, which have significance in combinatorics ([\cite=Carlitz], [\cite=HHN], [\cite=Riordan]), and states that an associated Turán expression is weakly Hurwitz stable, a property relevant in the analysis of linear systems [\cite=AM]. Unfortunately, Fisk passed away before he could finish his book, and the tentative proof of Problem [\ref=fisk-conjecture] which appears in the electronic draft [\cite=Fisk] is incorrect, as we show in Example [\ref=coneless] (this may be why it also appears in the open question list [\cite=Fisk]). By means of the following theorem we are able to answer Problem [\ref=fisk-conjecture] in the affirmative.

Let P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0 be a set of real polynomials such that deg (Pk) = k, for [formula]

If the sequence P satisfies

[formula]

a  ≠  0, [formula], and ck + 1  ≥  ck > 0 for all [formula], then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable for all [formula].

Let P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0 be a set of polynomials which satisfy

[formula]

for [formula], for each [formula]. For each k  ≥  1, all k zeros of Pk are real (see Remark [\ref=rem-real-roots]); let Mk denote that largest and mk denote the smallest zero of Pk. Then for each [formula], [formula] is non-zero when [formula] or [formula].

If the sequence P satisfies

[formula]

for all k  ≥  1, and each Pk has only non-positive zeros, then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable for all [formula].

Note that the types of sequences in Theorem [\ref=main-theorem] parts [\eqref=mt-1] and [\eqref=mt-3] consist of polynomials which have only real zeros. This follows immediately from the recurrences, since the operators a(x + b)(D + ck - 1) and c( - ax  +  b  +  D) preserve the property of having only real zeros (cf. [\cite=RS]). Although real, non-positive zeros are required in the hypothesis in part [\eqref=mt-2], the operator (xD - k) preserves the property of having real zeros for polynomials of degree k [\cite=RS]. In addition, in order to avoid a vacuous case for the theorem in parts [\eqref=mt-1] and [\eqref=mt-3] one should take P0 to be a non-zero real constant.

Indeed, with a = 1, b = 0, and ck = 1 for all [formula], Theorem [\ref=main-theorem] [\eqref=mt-1] establishes Problem [\ref=fisk-conjecture].

A Brief History of Turán Expressions

While obtaining a result concerning the root separation of consecutive Legendre polynomials, P. Turán [\cite=T] proved the following theorem.

Let Pk be the k-th Legendre polynomial, and P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0 be the sequence of Legendre polynomials. Then

[formula]

for all - 1  ≤  x  ≤  1, and [formula], where equality holds only for |x| = 1.

Turán's paper appeared in print after a publication of G. Szeg [\cite=Sz], who provided four additional proofs of Theorem [\ref=turan-theorem]. Citing assistance from G. Pólya, Szeg [\cite=Sz] establishes similar inequalities for the ultraspherical polynomials, the generalized Laguerre polynomials, and the Hermite polynomials. Inequalities in the form [\eqref=TuransLegendre] have been ardently investigated and extended, with contributions from a diverse assemblage of mathematicians [\cite=CC] [\cite=DS] [\cite=KSz] [\cite=P2] [\cite=S2] [\cite=S1] [\cite=Sz] [\cite=T].

For [formula] a fixed polynomial of degree exactly n, an important form of the Turán expression [\eqref=turan-ineq] is obtained for the sequence

[formula]

and appears in the Laguerre inequality [\cite=CC]. The Laguerre inequality and its analogs are useful in determining bounds for extreme zeros of a polynomial sequence [\cite=FK2], and in the study of the location of zeros of entire functions [\cite=CC]. Turán expressions are also ubiquitous in areas such as matrix theory [\cite=CCTP] and statistics [\cite=KSz].

The Turán expression can be represented in terms of a 2  ×  2 Hankel determinant

[formula]

which invites extension to higher dimensional determinants. In a comprehensive paper, S. Karlin and G. Szeg [\cite=KSz] addressed the properties of the higher dimensional determinants in the case that x is real (see also [\cite=Leclerc]). For a special case of the Turán expression, K. Dilcher and K. Stolarsky [\cite=DS] proved the following theorem regarding the location of zeros.

If all the zeros of P(z) are real and lie in the interval

[formula]

Dilcher and Stolarsky take their analysis well beyond Theorem [\ref=ds-wronskian], and extend their results to generalized Laguerre expressions (see [\cite=DS2], Theorem [\ref=ds-extended-theorem]). One such generalization gives rise to the extended Laguerre inequalities, which have importance in the theory of entire functions. In particular, these inequalities provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann-Hypothesis [\cite=CV]. We investigate extended Turán expressions, and show that the extended Turán expressions for the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind have zeros only at ±  1.

We note that our method of proof for Theorem [\ref=main-theorem] yields a less precise version of Theorem [\ref=ds-wronskian], that the zeros of WP must lie in the vertical strip [formula]. The proof of Theorem [\ref=main-theorem] uses standard methods involving the logarithmic derivative which are common in the analytic theory of polynomials [\cite=RS], and is similar to the proof of Theorem [\ref=ds-wronskian]. Results related to log-concavity have recently been obtained by D. Karp [\cite=Karp], who also conjectures Hurwitz stability for polynomials which arise from determinants.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. An example in Section [\ref=prelim] shows that the drafted proof of Problem [\ref=fisk-conjecture] contains a mistake (see [\cite=Fisk]), and we note an observation (Lemma [\ref=arg-arg]) for later use. In Section [\ref=section-turan], we establish the weak Hurwitz stability of the Turán expressions for several forms of polynomial sequences (Propositions [\ref=lem:main], [\ref=hermite-type], and [\ref=polar-type]), which proves Theorem [\ref=main-theorem]. We also obtain an analogous result for the Hermite polynomials (Proposition [\ref=hermite-turan]). An extended Turán expression is introduced in Section [\ref=high-turan], along with some supporting results for the Chebyshev polynomials (Propositions [\ref=prop-high-cheby] and [\ref=prop-high-cheby2]), and some conjectures regarding the Laguerre and single variable Bell polynomials (Conjectures [\ref=bell-conjecture] and [\ref=laguerre-conjecture]).

Preliminary Observations

We begin by recalling two results needed for our investigation.

If [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable, then the coefficients of f are non-negative.

This follows immediately from the non-negativity of the coefficients of the irreducible linear and quadratic factors of f.

For a complex polynomial [formula], where [formula] for [formula], let the real and imaginary parts of f be given by [formula], and [formula], respectively. Given a sequence of real numbers [formula], let [formula] be the number of sign changes of the sequence, where 0 values are omitted (e.g. V( + ,0, - , + ,0) = V( + , - , + ) = 2). Given two polynomials f0 and f1, with deg (f1)  <   deg (f0), we generate a sequence by the standard Euclidean algorithm with the following recursion: given deg (fk - 1) >  deg (fk), determine the quotient qk and remainder rk such that fk - 1 = qkfk + rk and deg (rk) <  deg (fk), then set fk + 1 =  - rk, and terminate when fk + 1 is the greatest common divisor of f0 and f1.

Let f be a monic polynomial of degree n. Denote by [formula] the sequence of polynomials generated by the Euclidean algorithm, started with [formula] and [formula], and set m = 0 if [formula]. If f has no real zeros, then the number p of zeros of f in the open upper half-plane is given by

[formula]

Let g denote the greatest common divisor of [formula] and [formula] associated to a monic polynomial f = f0 + if1. Since g is the factor of f containing all its real zeros, applying Theorem [\ref=sturm-hurwitz-criterion] to f / g counts the number of zeros p of f in the open upper half-plane. Then m = p +  deg (g) is the number of zeros of f in the closed upper half-plane.

Theorem [\ref=sturm-hurwitz-criterion] and Remark [\ref=zero-count] permit determination of the weak Hurwitz stability of any [formula] with degree n by verifying that all zeros of ( - i)nf(ix) lie in the closed upper half-plane. A frequently cited, equivalent result is the Routh-Hurwitz criterion [\cite=RS], but we found it was slower for our computations.

The proof of Theorem [\ref=main-theorem] involves the following elementary observation, which was also noted by Fisk [\cite=Fisk]. Let [formula] denote the conventional argument function.

If [formula], c > 0, [formula], and arg (x - a)∈(0,π / 2), arg (x - b)∈[null]. When x0 is real, [formula] implies that all the terms in the sum are positive. Thus, [\eqref=aheq] holds when [formula]. With

[formula]

the same argument, mutatis mutandis, shows that [\eqref=aheq] holds when [formula].

Let P  =  {Hk}∞k = 0 be the set of Hermite polynomials [\cite=R], and let Mk be the maximal zero of Hk, [formula] Then, for each [formula], [formula] is non-zero when [formula]

The Rodrigues-type formula for the Hermite polynomials [\cite=R] is

[formula]

whence

[formula]

Now, because Hermite polynomials of even degree are even functions and Hermite polynomials of odd degree are odd functions, we may replace the condition on x in Proposition [\ref=hermite-type] with the requirement that [formula]. The corollary then follows from [\eqref=hermiteRec] and Proposition [\ref=hermite-type].

We note one more condition which is sufficient for a sequence of polynomials to have a stable Turán expression. We thank the anonymous referee for informing us that such sequences have appeared in [\cite=Schur].

Let P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0 be a sequence of polynomials with only real non-positive zeros, such that deg (Pk) = k. If each Pk∈P satisfies (xD - k)Pk(x)  =  Pk - 1(x) for [formula], then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable.

Since

[formula]

the zeros of Pk - 1 interlace those of Pk by Rolle's theorem. The Turán expression [formula] vanishes at x0 if and only if the difference Pk(x0) / Pk + 1(x0)  -  Pk - 1(x0) / Pk(x0) also vanishes, provided x0 is not a zero of Pk or Pk + 1. Using (xD - k)Pk(x)  =  Pk - 1(x), one deduces that (Pk - 1 / Pk  -  Pk / Pk + 1)(x0)  ≠  0 for [formula] if and only if for [formula],

[formula]

Let {rj}k + 1j = 1 be the zeros of Pk + 1 and {sj}kj = 1 be the zeros of Pk, ordered such that

[formula]

Then,

[formula]

Since every numerator in [\eqref=redundant] has the same sign, for real x0  ≥  0, the sum must be non-zero. Furthermore, if [formula], then by Lemma [\ref=arg-arg], each term in [\eqref=redundant] has argument in (0,π] and thus the sum of the terms must be non-zero. The case [formula] follows by symmetry.

Statements [\eqref=mt-1], [\eqref=mt-3], and [\eqref=mt-2] are given by Propositions [\ref=lem:main], [\ref=hermite-type], and [\ref=polar-type], respectively.

Turán expressions for Laguerre and Jensen polynomials

Given a real entire function [formula], the n-th Jensen polynomial associated with f (cf. [\cite=CC]) is

[formula]

where [formula]. It is known that if f is a locally uniform limit of polynomials whose zeros are all real, then all of its associated Jensen polynomials also have only real zeros. Furthermore, gn(x / n)  →  f locally uniformly [\cite=CC]. The relation (n - xD)Pn(x)  =  nPn - 1(x) is satisfied when the sequence {Pn}∞n = 0 are Jensen polynomials associated to some entire function f [\cite=CC], and also when it is the sequence of Laguerre polynomials [\cite=R].

We have computed with Maxima that the Turán expression, [formula], is non-zero in the open left half-plane for the sequence of Laguerre polynomials up to k = 50. Fisk suggests that furthermore the determinants of Hankel matrices of Laguerre polynomials are non-zero in the open left half-plane [\cite=Fisk]. This motivates the following question.

Let P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0 be a sequence of polynomials with only real non-positive zeros, such that deg (Pk) = k. Suppose that for positive integers k, Pk∈P satisfies

[formula]

Is [formula] weakly Hurwitz stable for all [formula]

Let [formula], with γk > 0 for all [formula], be a real entire function that is a locally uniform limit of polynomials with only real zeros. T. Craven and G. Csordas have shown that the Jensen polynomials of f satisfy [formula] for [formula] [\cite=CC]. If the answer to Question [\ref=q:jensen] is affirmative, the Turán expressions for the Laguerre polynomials (reflected across the origin), the Jensen polynomials associated with f, and for sequences {Pk}∞k = 0 generated by the relation Pk = f(D)xk( = xkgk(1 / x)), will all be weakly Hurwitz stable. We make some stronger conjectures for the sequences of Bell and Laguerre polynomials in the next section (Conjecture [\ref=bell-conjecture], Conjecture [\ref=laguerre-conjecture]).

Higher order Turán expressions

For a real entire function f(x), the n-th extended Laguerre expression, [formula], is determined by

[formula]

As remarked in [\cite=CV] it follows that,

[formula]

Precise information on the locations of zeros for the [formula] has been obtained by Dilcher and Stolarsky [\cite=DS2]. Note that one can also consider [formula], which shifts the indices on the derivatives in [\eqref=extended-laguerre] by k. It is known that a real entire function f can be obtained as a locally uniform limit of polynomials with only real zeros if and only if [formula] for all [formula], and for all [formula] [\cite=CV]. In analogy to the extended Laguerre expression, denote the k-th extended Turán expression for the sequence of polynomials P  =  {Pk(x)}∞k = 0 by

[formula]

When n = 1 in [\eqref=extended-turan], the original Turán expression is recovered, [formula].

Let [formula] be the exponential generating function for a sequence of polynomials P  =  {Pk}∞k = 0, and let G(k)(x,t)  =  (∂  /  ∂t)kG(x,t). Then, similar to [\eqref=extended-laguerre],

[formula]

The extended Turán inequalities were investigated by M. L. Patrick [\cite=P2], who proved their positivity on prescribed regions of the real axis for the ultraspherical, generalized Laguerre, Hermite, and Chebyshev polynomials (first and second kind), and also for the sequences of their derivatives.

Let P  =  {Tk(x)}∞k = 0, where Tk is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind [\cite=R]. It is known that

[formula]

for [formula], and thus [formula] always has zeros at [formula]. This observation can be extended as follows.

If P  =  {Tk(x)}∞k = 0, where Tk is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, then

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula]

The exponential generating function for the Chebyshev polynomials (cf. [\cite=R]) is

[formula]

Re-writing [\eqref=tc-gen] with exponential functions, one obtains

[formula]

Consequently,

[formula]

Using [\eqref=turan-gen], the claim then follows from [\eqref=cheby-turan] by inspecting the Maclaurin expansion of [formula] in t.

From the generating function,

[formula]

a formula for the extended Turán expressions can also be obtained for the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind [\cite=R], {Un}∞n = 0, using the same method of proof as in Proposition [\ref=prop-high-cheby].

If P  =  {Uk(x)}∞k = 0, where Uk is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind, then

[formula]

for [formula] and [formula].

We were unable to find similar formulas for the other orthogonal polynomial families, but the calculation for the extended Turán expressions for the Chebyshev polynomials suggests the following conjectures.

If B  =  {Bk(x)}∞k = 0, where Bk is the k-th univariate Bell polynomial, then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable for [formula] and [formula].

If P  =  {Lk(x)}∞k = 0, where Lk is the k-th Laguerre polynomial, then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable for [formula] and [formula].

If P  =  {Yk(x)}∞k = 0, where

[formula]

is the k-th Bessel polynomial, then [formula] is weakly Hurwitz stable for [formula] and [formula].

Conjectures [\ref=bell-conjecture], [\ref=laguerre-conjecture], and [\ref=bessel-conjecture] have been verified for 1  ≤  k  ≤  50, and 1  ≤  n  ≤  5 using Theorem [\ref=sturm-hurwitz-criterion] and Remark [\ref=zero-count] implemented in Maxima.

For the extended Laguerre expressions, Dilcher and Stolarsky have proved the following.

If all the zeros of the degree d polynomial P are located in the interval

[formula]

It seems reasonable to suspect that when a sequence of polynomials has interlacing zeros and the zero locations are similar to a sequence of consecutive derivatives, then approximate versions of the Theorem [\ref=ds-extended-theorem] hold.
