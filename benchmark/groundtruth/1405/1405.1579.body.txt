Kakutani type Borsuk-Ulam theorem

For a set S denote by 2S the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. Let X and Y be topological spaces. Say that F:X  →  2Y is a set-valued function on X with a closed graph if graph(F) = {(x,y)∈X  ×  Y:y∈F(x)} is a closed as a subset of X  ×  Y.

The Kakutani fixed point theorem [\cite=Kakutani] states: Let S be a non-empty, compact and convex subset of [formula]. Let F:S  →  2S be a set-valued function on S with a closed graph and the property that F(x) is non-empty and convex for all x∈S. Then there is y∈S such that y∈F(y). (The point y is called a fixed point.)

In our paper [\cite=MusBUT] we extended the Borsuk-Ulam theorem for manifolds. Let M be a compact PL (piece-wise linear) d-dimensional manifold without boundary with a free simplicial involution A:M  →  M, i. e. A2(x) = A(A(x)) = x and A(x)  ≠  x. We say that a pair (M,A) is a BUT (Borsuk-Ulam Type) manifold if for any continuous [formula] there is a point x∈M such that g(A(x)) = g(x). Equivalently, if a continuous map [formula] is antipodal, i. e. f(A(x)) =  - f(x), then the zeros set Zf: = f- 1(0) is not empty.

In [\cite=MusBUT], we found several equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions for manifolds to be BUT. For instance, M is a BUT manifold if and only if M admits an antipodal continuous transversal to zeros map [formula] with |Zh| = 2 mod 4.

The class of BUT manifolds is sufficiently large. It is clear that [formula] with A(x) =  - x is a BUT-manifold. Suppose that M can be represented as a connected sum N  #  N, where N is a closed PL manifold. Then M admits a free involution. Indeed, M can be "centrally symmetric" embedded to [formula] with some k and the antipodal symmetry x  →   - x in [formula] implies a free involution A:M  →  M [\cite=MusBUT]. For instance, orientable two-dimensional manifolds M2g with even genus g and non-orientable manifolds P2m with even m, where m is the number of Möbius bands, are BUT-manifolds.

Let M be a compact PL BUT-manifold of dimension d with a free involution A. Let [formula] be a set-valued function on M with a closed graph and the property that for all x∈M the set F(x) is non-empty and convex in [formula] and there is y∈F(x) such that ( - y)∈F(A(x)). Then there is x0∈M such that F(x0) covers the origin [formula].

Note that any PL manifold admit a metric. For a triangulation T of M the norm of T, denoted by |T|, is the diameter of the largest simplex in T.

Let [formula] be a sequence of antipodal triangulations of M with [formula]. Now we define an antipodal mapping [formula]. Note that if we define fi for all vertices V(Ti), then fi can be piece-wise linearly extended to all Ti, i. e. to [formula].

Let x∈V(Ti). Then A(x) is also a vertex of Ti. Let y∈F(x) be a point in [formula] such that ( - y)∈F(A(x)). Then for the pair (x,A(x)) set fi(x): = y and fi(A(x)): =  - y.

Now we have a continuous antipodal mapping [formula]. By assumption, M is BUT, therefore, there is a point xi∈M such that fi(xi) = 0. Now, suppose that xi lies in a d-simplex si of Ti with vertices [formula] and let yik: = fi(vik). (Note that [formula].) We have [formula] in [formula]. Let [formula] be the barycentric coordinates of 0 relative to the simplex in [formula] with vertices [formula]. Then

[formula]

Since M is compact the sequences {xi}∞i = 1,  {tik}∞i = 1,  {yik}∞i = 1, [formula], may, after possibly renumbering them, be assumed to converge to points x0,tk and [formula] respectively.

Finally, since the set-valued function F has closed graph, [formula]. Since F takes convex values, F(x0) is convex and so [formula], being a convex combination of the yk is in F(x0). Thus x0 is the required point in M.

Let M be a compact PL BUT-manifold of dimension d with a free involution A. Let [formula] be a set-valued function on M with a closed graph. Then there is x0∈M such that the sets F(x0) and F(A(x0)) have a common intersection point.

Let (x),  x∈M, be the Minkowski difference of F(x) and F(A(x)) in [formula],

[formula]

Then (A(x)) =  - (x). Thus, the theorem for [formula] yields this corollary.
