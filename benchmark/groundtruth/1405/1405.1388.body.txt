Rudin's Submodules of [formula]

Introduction

Let [formula] denote the Hardy space over the unit disc [formula]. We also say that [formula] is the Hardy module over [formula]. The Hilbert space tensor product [formula] is called the Hardy module over [formula] and is denoted by [formula]. As is well known, every vector in [formula] can be represented as square summable power series over [formula] and the multiplication operators by the coordinate functions (Mz1,Mz2) are commuting and doubly commuting isometries (see [\cite=R]). We will often identify (Mz1,Mz2) with [formula].

A closed subspace S of [formula] (or [formula]) is said to be a submodule if S is invariant under Mz1 and Mz2 (or Mz). Beurling's (cf. [\cite=DP]) celebrated result states that a closed subspace [formula] is a submodule of [formula] if and only if [formula] for some bounded inner function [formula]. This is a fundamental result which has far-reaching consequences. For instance, it readily follows that [formula] admits the wandering subspace [formula]. In particular, [formula] is a generating set of S. The same conclusion also holds when S is one of the followings: a submodule of the Bergman module [\cite=ARS], a doubly commuting submodule of [formula]  [\cite=SSW] and a doubly commuting submodule of the Bergman space or the Dirichlet space over polydisc [\cite=CDSS]. This motivates us to look into the "wandering subspace" [formula], and leads us to ask whether WS is a generating set of S or not, where S is a submodule of [formula]. In general, however, this question has a negative answer. Rudin [\cite=R] demonstrated a negative answer to this question by constructing a submodule S of [formula] for which [formula] is a finite dimensional subspace but not a generating set of S.

Our motivation in this paper is the following: (1) to study a natural class of submodules, namely "generalized Rudin submodules", and (2) to compute the wandering dimensions of generalized Rudin submodules. In particular, we are interested in understanding the wandering subspace of Rudin submodules of [formula]. Our results, restricted to the case of Rudin's submodule answers a question raised by Douglas and Yang (see Corollary [\ref=rudin]). Also these results are one important step in our program to understand the idea of constructing new submodules and quotient modules out of old ones.

Given an inner function [formula], for notational simplicity, we set

[formula]

We now turn to formulate our definition of generalized Rudin submodule. Let [formula] be a sequence of increasing inner functions and [formula] be a sequence of decreasing inner functions. Then the generalized Rudin submodule corresponding to the inner sequence Ψ and Φ is denoted by SΨ,Φ, and defined by

[formula]

Now let {αn}n  ≥  0 be a sequence of points in [formula] and [formula] such that [formula], and ψn  =  zn, and [formula], n  ≥  0. Then SΨ,Φ will be denoted by SΦ:

[formula]

Here for each non-zero [formula], we denote by bα the Blaschke factor [formula] and for α = 0 we set b0(z): = z.

The sequence of Blaschke products as defined above is called the Rudin sequence, and the submodule SΦ as defined above is called the Rudin submodule corresponding to the Rudin sequence Φ. These submodules are also called inner sequence based invariant subspaces of [formula], and was studied by M. Seto and R. Yang [\cite=SY], Seto [\cite=S1] [\cite=S2] [\cite=S3] and Izuchi et al. [\cite=III2].

The main result of this paper states that

[formula]

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 collects necessary notations and contains preparatory materials, which are an essential tool in what follows. After this preparatory section, which contain also new results, the main theorems are proved in Section 3.

Preparatory results

We begin with the following representations of SΨ,Φ (cf. [\cite=III2]).

Let SΨ,Φ be a generalized Rudin submodule and φ- 1:  =  0. Then

[formula]

First note that for all n  ≥  1,

[formula]

Then the required representation of SΨ,Φ can be obtained from the above identity and the fact that Sψn  ⊆  Sψn - 1,(n  ≥  1).

Keeping the equality [formula] in mind we pass to describe the closed subspace [formula].

Let SΨ,Φ be a generalized Rudin's submodule and φ- 1: = 0. Then

[formula]

By Lemma  [\ref=representation] it follows that

[formula]

Thus the result follows from the fact that [formula], for any inner [formula].

Before proceeding further, we first observe that for [formula] and m  ≥  1, {bjαM*zbα}m - 1j = 0 is an orthogonal basis of the quotient module Qbmα.

Let θ1,θ2 be a pair of inner functions such that θ1  =  bmαθ2 for some [formula] and m  ≥  1. Then

[formula]

In particular, [formula] is an m-dimensional subspace of [formula].

The proof follows from the fact that Mθ2 is an isometry and {bjαM*zbα}m - 1j = 0 is an orthogonal basis of Qbmα.

To proceed with our discussion it is useful to compute the matrix representation of the operator [formula] with respect to the orthogonal basis {θ2bjαM*zbα}m - 1j = 0, which will be used in the proof of the main result of this paper. To this end let vj  =  θ2bjαM*zbα for all [formula]. Then

[formula]

Note that

[formula]

where [formula] is the Szegö kernel on [formula] defined by [formula], [formula]. Consequently, for i  =  j, we have

[formula]

for i > j,

[formula]

and for j > i,

[formula]

where the last equality follows from

[formula]

Therefore,

[formula]

Finally, since [formula] is an isometry for any 0  ≤  i  ≤  m - 1, we have

[formula]

The computations above then show that the matrix representation of [formula] with respect to the orthonormal basis [formula] is the upper triangular matrix with diagonal entries [formula] and off diagonal entries ( - α)j - i - 1(1 - |α|2).

Main Results

Let SΦ be a Rudin submodule of [formula]. Then

[formula]

Since {n  ≥  0:αn = 0} is a finite set, it is enough to show that the equality holds. First, observe that

[formula]

Now Lemmas [\ref=representation] and [\ref=zwandering], with ψn  =  zn, n  ≥  0, and φ- 1  =  0 implies that

[formula]

and

[formula]

Then

[formula]

where for the last equality we have used the fact that [formula]. Therefore,

[formula]

For the first term on the right-hand side, we have [formula], that is,

[formula]

On the other hand, the representing matrix of [formula] with respect to the orthonormal basis [formula], as discussed at the end of the previous section, is an upper triangular matrix with n - 1 on the diagonal. This matrix is invertible if and only if αn - 1  ≠  0. In the case of αn - 1 = 0, since the supper diagonal entries are 1, the rank of the representing matrix is ln - 1 and hence the kernel is one-dimensional. This completes the proof.

As an illustration of the above theorem, we consider an explicit example of Rudin submodule. Let SR denotes the submodule of [formula], consisting those functions which have zero of order at least n at (0,αn): = (0,1 - n- 3). This submodule was introduced by W. Rudin in the context of infinite rank submodules of [formula]. It is also well known that such SR is a Rudin submodule (see [\cite=SY], [\cite=S2], [\cite=S3]), that is, SR  =  SΦ where

[formula]

In this case, for all n  ≥  1, [formula]. Set

[formula]

Then {φnek}∞k = n is an orthogonal basis for [formula], for all n  ≥  1. A similar calculation, as in the end of the previous section, shows that the matrix representation of the operator [formula] with respect to {φnek}∞k = n is again an upper triangular infinite matrix with diagonal entries [formula] (k  ≥  n). Therefore [formula] for all n > 1. Now for n = 1, since α1 = 0 its kernel is one dimensional. By the same argument, as in the proof of the above theorem, we obtain the following result.

Let SR be the Rudin submodule as above. Then [formula] is a two dimensional subspace giben by

[formula]

We end this note with an intriguing question, raised by Nakazi [\cite=N]: Does there exist a submodule S of [formula] with S  =  1, such that [formula] is not a generating set for S? Although we are unable to determine such (counter-)example, however, we do have the following special example: let [formula] be a sequence of distinct points and Φ  =  {φn}n  ≥  0, and [formula]. Then, by the main result of this paper, [formula] is a one dimensional, non-generating subspace of SΦ. In fact it follows from [\cite=III2] that the rank of SΦ is 2.
