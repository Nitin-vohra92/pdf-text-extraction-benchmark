i. introduction

The field of molecular electronics has been rapidly expanding during the last two decades owing to continuous improvement of techniques intended to electrically contact and control quantum dots and single molecules in transport junctions. Recent advances in heat measurements in nanoscale systems allow to study thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions and similar systems. These studies bring a deeper understanding of transport mechanisms [\cite=1] [\cite=2] [\cite=3] [\cite=4] and additional information concerning electronic and vibrational excitation spectra of molecules [\cite=5] [\cite=6]. Also, in the recent years a new field of molecular thermoelectronics have emerged [\cite=7]. Thermal analogs of molecular transistors and heat-into-electricity converters were proposed [\cite=5] [\cite=8] [\cite=9] [\cite=10] [\cite=11] [\cite=12].

Heat-to-electric power converters operate due to Seebeck effect which appears provided that thermal and electric driving forces simultaneously affect electron transport through the considered system. When a temperature gradient ΔT is applied across the system, a thermovoltage Vth emerges under the condition of zero net current thus indicating the energy conversion. At small temperature gradients (ΔT  ≪  T0, T0 being the temperature of the cool region) the system operates within the linear regime and Vth  =    -  SΔT. Within this regime, thermopower S is the decisive quantity determining the extent of energy conversion. Accordingly, the thermopower was intensively studied [\cite=5] [\cite=10] [\cite=13] [\cite=14] [\cite=15] [\cite=16] along with the thermoelectric figure of merit [\cite=15] [\cite=17] [\cite=18]. Another interesting quantity characterizing thermoelectric transport through molecular junctions and other systems of similar kind is thermocurrent Ith. The latter may be defined as a difference between the electron tunnel current flowing through a biased thermoelectric junction where the electrodes are kept at different temperatures (TL  =  T0  +  ΔT, TR  =  T0) and the current flowing in absence of temperature gradient [\cite=19]:

[formula]

As well as the thermovoltage, the thermocurrent is simultaneously controlled by electric and thermal driving forces. The combined effect of these forces depends of the type of charge carriers involved in transport and of the bias voltage polarity. When the bias voltage is sufficiently strong, its effect predominates. Consequently, the difference between two terms in the Eq. ([\ref=1]) diminishes, and Ith approaches zero. At the same time, the thermocurrent flowing through an unbiased or slightly biased molecule (or quantum dot) is mostly controlled by the applied temperature gradient ΔT. Assuming that V  =  0 and ΔT  >  0 (the left electrode is warmer than the right one), Ith takes on positive/negative values when the charge carriers involved in transport process are, respectively, holes/electrons. Finally, when V and ΔT influence the transport to a similar extent, the resulting magnitude and direction of Ith are determined by both ΔT sign and the bias voltage polarity. These two factors may cooperate or counteract by pushing charge carriers in the same or opposite directions. In the latter case, Ithmay change its sign at certain values of V and ΔT when electric and thermal driving forces counterbalance each other. It was shown that (disregarding electron-phonon interactions) maximum efficiency of molecular heat-to-electricity converter could be reached under the condition of vanishing current I(V,T0,ΔT). Under this condition, Ith  =    -  I(V,T0,ΔT  =  0). Therefore, relatively large in magnitude thermocurrent flowing through a system may indicate that the system operates in the regime favorable for energy conversion [\cite=20].

Properties of the thermovoltage in molecular junctions and quantum dots were theoretically analyzed in numerous works [\cite=20] [\cite=21] [\cite=22] [\cite=23] [\cite=24] [\cite=25] [\cite=26] [\cite=27] [\cite=28] [\cite=29]. As yet, less attention was paid to studies of thermocurrent in spite of the fact that Ith is more straightforward to measure and model than Vth, as stated in the recent work [\cite=19]. However, theoretical analysis of Ith behavior within a weakly nonlinear regime was recently suggested [\cite=25]. The purpose of the present work is to analyze the effect of the gate voltage, electron-electron interactions and thermal phonons on the electrodes on the characteristics of thermocurrent flowing through a single-molecule junction or a quantum dot.

To properly analyze thermoelectric transport through molecules/quantum dots one needs to use an approach including unified treatment of electron and phonon dynamics in the considered system. For this purpose, one may use diagrammatic technique or nonequilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF), as described in the review [\cite=30]. However, application of these advanced formalisms to realistic models simulating molecular junctions is extremely difficult. Several simplified approaches based on scattering theory [\cite=6] and on quantum rate equations [\cite=5] [\cite=14] [\cite=20] [\cite=31] [\cite=32] were developed and used to study thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions taking into account contributions of vibrational phonons and electron-vibron interactions. Very recently, a scattering theory based approach was suggested to analyze weakly nonlinear thermoelectric transport in mesoscopic systems [\cite=25] [\cite=26] [\cite=27]. Nevertheless, these studies are not completed so far.

In the present work we use a scattering theory first suggested by Buttiker [\cite=33] combined with certain NEGF based results. The adopted approach allows to derive the expression for the electron transmission which remains applicable for an arbitrary value of the difference between the temperatures of the electrodes. Therefore, this expression may be employed to analyze nonlinear effects in thermoelectric properties of considered systems.

ii. model and results

The schematics of the suggested model is presented in the Fig. 1. To simplify the computations we mimic the bridge linking the electrodes by a single state with the energy E0. This energy is independent of the electrodes chemical potentials. However, if the third (gate) electrode is attaches to the system, one may shift the position of the bridge level by applying the gate voltage. We assume that electrons tunnel from the electrodes to the bridge and vice versa via the channels 1 and 2 thus maintaining an elastic component of the charge flow. Incoming wave amplitudes a1,a2 and outgoing wave amplitudes a1',a2' characterize this process. Also, electrons in the electrodes may interact with thermal phonons. An electron may enter the bridge by emitting or absorbing a phonon. Such electrons contribute to inelastic component of the charge flow. We assume that the total current is the sum of the elastic and inelastic components. To describe the inelastic contribution to the current we introduce a pair of dephasing/dissipative electron reservoirs. The channels 3,4 and/or 5,6 connect these reservoirs with the bridge. While in a reservoir, the electron undergoes scattering by thermal phonons and then it tunnels to the bridge, so there is no direct coupling of the bridge to the thermal phonons. In the present analysis we assume that the thermal phonons are associated with the left and right electrodes which are kept at the temperatures TL and TR. The labels indicated the reservoirs are accordingly chosen.

So, within the accepted model we have six transport channels. The relations between incoming particle fluxes Jk and outgoing fluxes Jk' take on the form (1  ≤  i  ≤  k  ≤  6):

[formula]

Here, the coefficients Tik are related to matrix elements of the scattering matrix M: Tik  =  |Mik|2. To maintain the charge conservation in the system, zero net current should flow in the channels linking the bridge with the reservoirs:

[formula]

The scattering matrix express outgoing wave amplitudes bL',bR',a3',a4',a5' and a6' in terms of incident ones bL,bR,a3,a4,a5,a6. To derive expressions for the matrix elements Mik we first consider a part of the whole system shown in the Fig. 1. This part consists of the reservoir of the Temperature TL associated with the left electrode and the bridge site. Following the Buttuker's approach [\cite=33], we find the expression far the matrix s(1) relating wave amplitudes a1',a2',a3',a4' to wave amplitudes a1,a2,a3,a4 namely

[formula]

Here, εL is the scattering probability associated with the effect of thermal phonons concentrated on the left electrode (and represented by the corresponding dephasing/dissipative reservoir). When εL  =  0, the reservoir is detached from the bridge, so thermal phonons do not affect electron's tunneling from the left electrode to the bridge. Within the opposite limit (εL = 1), electrons traveling from the left electrode to the bridge are necessarily scattered into the reservoir which results in the overall phase randomization and inelastic transport. Electron tunneling through a barrier separating the left electrode from the bridge is characterized by the transmission and reflection amplitudes (tL and rL, respectively). These are matrix elements of a 2  ×  2 matrix:

[formula]

which relates bL',a1' to bL,a1. Combining Egs. ([\ref=4]) and ([\ref=5]) one obtained the following expression for the matrix M(1) which relates bL',a2',a3',a4' to bL,a2,a3,a4:

[formula]

Here, [formula] now, we take into consideration the remaining part of the considered system. As shown in an earlier work [\cite=34], the matrix M(2) relating a2',bR',a5',a6' to a2,bR,a5,a6 has the form:

[formula]

where [formula] the scattering probability εR is associated with the effect of thermal phonons concentrated on the right electrode, and the transmission (tR) and reflection (rR) amplitudes characterize electron tunneling between the bridge site and tunneling between the bridge site the right electrode. Using Eqs. ([\ref=6]), ([\ref=7]), one arrives at the following expression for the scattering matrix [\cite=35]: Here, Z  =  1  -  α2Lα2RrLrR.

Solving the equations ([\ref=2]), ([\ref=3]) one arrives at the following expression for the electron transmission [\cite=36]:

[formula]

Within the considered model, 1  ≤  m, n  ≤  2,

[formula]

and matrix elements of 2  ×  2 matrix W are given by

[formula]

where

[formula]

It is known that thermoelectric efficiency of a thermoelectric materials becomes reduced if the phonons thermal conductance takes on significant values. In the expression of thermoelectric figure of merit which characterizes the efficiency of energy conversion at small temperature gradients,the denominator is the sum of electron and phonon thermal conductances [\cite=37] [\cite=38]. We remark that within the adopted model the phonon thermal conductance through the junction is zero. This seems a reasonable assumption for experiments give low values of phonon thermal conductance in several molecular junctions [\cite=39] [\cite=40]. This may be attributed to the fact that in many molecules the majority of vibrational transitions lie above the range determined by thermal energy provided that relevant temperatures take on values below room temperature [\cite=15] [\cite=41].

In the following analysis we focus on a significantly coupled system. Provided that the dephasing reservoirs are detached from the bridge (εL  =  εR  =  0) and the barriers separating the electrodes from the bridge are identical (tL  =  tR  =  t, rL  =  rR  =  r), the electron transmission determined by Eqs. ([\ref=8])-([\ref=12]) accepts a simple form:

[formula]

As known, in the case of coherent transport, the current flowing through the system could be presented in the form:

[formula]

Here, ΓσL,R(E) are self-energy terms describing coupling of an electron on the bridge (with a certain spin orientation σ) to the electrodes, fL,R are Fermi distribution functions for the electrons on the electrodes, and Gr,a, <σ(E) are the retarded, advanced and lesser Green's functions associated with the QD/molecule.

Further, we accept a wide-band approximation for the self-energy terms, and we concentrate on a symmetrically coupled system assuming ΓσL  =  ΓσR  =  Γ. Then the term proportional to the lesser Green's function disappears from Eq. ([\ref=14]), and we obtain:

[formula]

where the electron transmission function is given by

[formula]

So, we have derived two expressions for the electron transmission function appropriate to describe coherent electron transport through the considered system. One of them (Eq. ([\ref=13])) is obtained using the scattering theory whereas another one (Eq. ([\ref=16])) is ensued employing NEGF formalism. Within the considered coherent limit these expressions should be identical. Comparing them, we get:

[formula]

Provided that the electron transport through the junction is undisturbed by electron-phonon interactions and disregarding spin-flip processes, Grσ(E) may be approximated as [\cite=42]:

[formula]

In this expression, U is the charging energy describing Coulomb repulsion between electrons on the bridge, and [formula] are one-particle occupation numbers which could be computed by integration of the lesser Green's function G<σ(E) over the whole range of tunnel energy E values:

[formula]

Self-energy terms Σoσ, Σ1σ and Σ2σ appear in the Eq. ([\ref=10]) due to the coupling of the bridge to the leads:

[formula]

Here, trβ;σ are parameters describing the coupling of r,β electron states on the electrode β(β  =  L,R) to the bridge state, εrβ;σ are single-electron energies in the electrode β, fβrσ is the Fermi distribution function for the energy εrβ;σ, chemical potential μβ and temperature Tβ and η is a positive infinitisemal parameter. Previously introduced coupling parameters ΓσL,R are closely related to Σ0σ, namely: Σ0σ  =  ΣL0σ  +  ΣR0σ, ΓσL,R  =    -  2ΣL,Roσ. We remark that Σ1σ and Σ2σ depend on the temperatures of electrodes which is taken into account in further computations.

Scattering probabilities εL,R may be given an explicit physical meaning by expressing them in terms of relevant energies. In the considered system, dephasing and energy dissipation originate from interactions of charge carriers in the electrodes with thermal phonons. So, one can approximate these parameters as follows:

[formula]

Here, Γβph represents the self-energy term occurring due to electron-phonon interactions in the electrode β. Using NEGF to compute the relevant electron and phonon Green's functions within the self-consistent Born approximation, one may derive a relatively simple approximation for Γβph [\cite=43]:

[formula]

In writing down this expression, we had assumed that the coupling strength λαβ characterizing interaction between an electron in the electrode β and a thermal phonon with the energy ωα does not depend of the electron state r,σ. The electrodes are kept at different temperatures Tβ, so we introduce two phonon distribution functions [formula] being the Bolzmann's constant).

The phonon spectral function may be determined using molecular dynamic simulations. However, to qualitatively analyze the effect of thermal phonons on the transport characteristics, one may use the approximation [\cite=44]:

[formula]

where θ(ω) is the Heaviside step function, and ωcβ characterize relaxation times for the thermal phonons.

Substituting the approximation ([\ref=26]) into Eq. ([\ref=25]) one may see that the major contribution to the integral comes from the region where ω  ~  ωc. On these grounds, one may replace ω by ωcβ in the arguments of slowly varying functions in the integrand of Eq ([\ref=25]). Also, one may assume that ωcβ is much smaller than μβ. So, corrections including ωcβ in the arguments of the Fermi distribution functions and delta functions may be omitted. Then one may use the expression for Γσβ which follows from its definition:

[formula]

to reduce Eq. ([\ref=25]) to the form:

[formula]

where ζ(x;q) is the Riemann's ζ function. If the thermal energy kTβ significantly exceeds ωc, Γβph accepts an especially simple form, namely: [formula] In further calculations we assume for simplicity that λL  =  λR  =  λ.

For a considered symmetrically coupled junction, the thermocurrent is described by the following expression:

[formula]

where Δτ is given by:

[formula]

The suggested approach allows one to analyze the effect of thermal phonons on characteristics of thermoelectric transport beyond the linear regime. Using Eqs. ([\ref=8])-([\ref=28]), one may compute the electron transmission function for an arbitrary value of the ratio ΔT / T0. This result may be used to calculate thermocurrent and analyze how it is affected by various characteristics of the considered junction (such as the quality of contact between the electrodes and the linker, electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions) and by external factors including the bias and gate voltage and temperature gradient.

iii. discussion

The most interesting thermoelectric properties are better pronounced in weakly coupled junctions where electron transmission exhibits sharp maxima [\cite=20]. Correspondingly, in further analysis we assume that Γ  <  kT0. Then, as shown in the Fig. 2, Δτ displays sharp dips at E  =  E0 and E  =  E0  +  U, and the magnitudes of these features increase as the difference in the temperatures of electrodes enhances. Electron-phonon interactions significantly affect the transmission. As the coupling between electrons and thermal phonons strengthens, Δτ generally takes on greater values. However, too strong electron-phonon interactions bring partial spreading of the resonance features which is not favorable for nonlinear behavior of thermocurrent to be revealed.

Thermocurrent dependence of the applied bias voltage is illustrated in the left panel of the Fig. 3 assuming for certainty that the left (hot) electrode is kept at higher voltage and the bridge energy level E0 is situated below the Fermi level for the electrodes. When the bias is small so that E0 remains outside the conduction window whose width is determined by the difference between chemical potentials of electrodes μL and μR, the charge flow is driven by the temperature gradient. Higher temperature of the left electrode enhances probability for an electron to tunnel there from the bridge provided that E0 is rather close to the Fermi level, so that their difference is of the same order as the thermal energy kT0. Under these conditions, Ith takes on positive values. When the bias becomes greater, E0 enters the conduction window, and the electric driving forces come into play. As a result, the thermocurrent changes its sign. It remains negative at moderate bias. In strongly biased junctions, electric driving forces predominate, and Ith approaches zero. The depth of the dip appearing on the Ith  -  V curves, as well as its position, are controlled by several factors. Assuming that the charging energy U and electron-phonon coupling strength λ are fixed, it is determined by the value of ΔT. The greater becomes the difference between the electrodes temperatures, the greater is the maximum magnitude of Ith indicating more favorable conditions for energy conversion in the considered system.

It was reported [\cite=19] that thermocurrent flowing through a quantum dot may exhibit a nonlinear dependence of ΔT even at small values of the latter. As recently suggested [\cite=25], the nonlinearity appears due to renormalization of the energy E0 in the presence of temperature gradient. Taking into account the suggested energy renormalization, we showed that weak nonlinearity of Ith versus ΔT curves may be actually traced (see right panel of the Fig. 3). Presented curves demonstrate a qualitative agreement with the experimental results of Ref. [\cite=19]. However, we remark that the suggested renormalization E0  →  E0  +  zkΔT where |z|  <  1 may significantly affect the thermocurrent behavior only at certain values of the bias voltage, when E0 is very close to the boundary of the conduction window.

Coulomb repulsion between electrons on the bridge and the electron interactions with thermal phonons may significantly influence thermoelectric transport through the junction, as demonstrated in the Fig. 4. The enhancement of charging energy narrows down the interval where Ith accepts negative values and makes the dips in the Ith  -  V curves more shallow. This may be explained by considering the role taken by Coulomb interactions. Electron-electron interactions are hindering electron flow through the system in both directions, which leads to the Coulomb blockade. These interactions could be treated as a source of an effective force opposing any predominating driving force (originating either from the bias voltage or from the temperature gradient applied across the junction). As a result, the characteristic features manifested in the shapes of Ith  -  V curves become less distinctly pronounced.

Electrons interactions with thermal phonons do not change the width of the region where Ith remains negative. However, these interactions may affect the magnitude of thermocurrent. In the right panel of the Fig. 4, we present the Ith value at the bottom of the dip as a function of the electron-phonon coupling strength. As shown in the figure, the dip depth reduces as λ increases. This effect is better pronounced at weak or moderate electron-phonon coupling [formula] and it fades away when λ significantly exceeds Γ.

As known, transport properties of molecular junctions and other similar systems may be controlled by varying the positions of the bridge energy levels. Practically, the levels may be shifted by a gate voltage applied to the system. Within the accepted model, the bridge in the considered junction is represented by a single energy level E0. In the Fig. 5 we trace the thermocurrent dependencies of E0. The presented results confirm those shown in the previous figures. Again, the thermocurrent acquires a negative sign when the bridge level moving upwards appears in the conduction window. For a symmetrically coupled system this happens at [formula] assuming that the Fermi level for unbiased junction μ  =  0.As the bridge level moves higher, Ith remains negative while the level is still inside the conduction window. When it leaves the window but remains near its upper boundary, the thermocurrent may change sign once more, being influenced by electron-electron interactions and electron-phonon interactions in the electrodes. However, when the bridge level moves farther away from the conduction window, both terms in the Eq. ([\ref=1]) approach zero, so the thermocurrent disappears.

iv. conclusion

Finally, we repeat again that various aspects of energy conversion in nanoscale systems attract significant interest of the research community. The present work was inspired by this common interest. Also, the present research was motivated by recent experimental observations of nonlinear thermocurrent flowing through quantum dots. The thermocurrent defined by Eq. ([\ref=1]) is an important characteristic of thermoelectric transport. The behavior of the thermocurrent brings some information concerning the efficiently of energy conversion in the considered systems. For instance, Ith reaches minimum at a certain value of the applied bias voltage, as shown in the Figs. 3,4. One may conjecture that this minimum occurs when the current I(V,T0,ΔT) becomes zero, so the corresponding magnitude of bias voltage is close to the magnitude of thermovoltage Vth and may be employed to estimate the latter. However, we remark that one cannot extract sufficient information to properly estimate the thermoelectric efficiency of the system basing on the thermocurrent behavior alone. Even within the linear in temperature regime one needs additional information concerning electron electrical and thermal conductances and thermopower to make such estimates.

In a nanoscale junction consisting of a quantum dot or molecule sandwiched in between two electrodes, the thermocurrent value is controlled by several factors. These include temperatures of electrodes, bias and gate voltage, charging energy characterizing electron-electron interactions on the bridge and specific energies characterizing the coupling of the bridge to the electrodes and electron-phonon interactions. To theoretically analyze possible effect of the above factors on thermocurrent we employ a single-particle scattering approach pioneered by Landauer in the context of charge transport in mesoscopic systems.

For simplicity, we simulate the bridge in the considered junction by a single orbital, and we assume that it is symmetrically coupled to the electrodes. Then the thermocurrent is expressed in terms of electron transmission functions (which depend on all above mentioned factors) and Fermi distribution functions for the electrodes. We derive the expression for the electron transmission which remains valid for an arbitrary value of the difference between the temperatures of electrodes. This makes it suitable for analysis of thermoelectric transport both within and beyond linear in temperature regime. Using this expression, we show that varying the bias and gate voltage one may create favorable conditions for heat-to-electricity conversion in a junction assuming that the most important characteristic energies kT0, U and λ are fixed. Also, we analyze how electron-electron interactions on the bridge and electrons interactions with thermal phonons associated with electrodes may affect the thermoelectric properties of the considered systems. Coulomb repulsion between electrons opposes electron transport through the junction at small bias voltage. We show that this brings a partial suppression of the thermocurrent. Electron-phonon interactions in the electrodes assist in the increase of scattering probabilities thus destroying the coherence of electron transport and bringing additional suppression of thermocurrent, as illustrated in Figs. 4,5.

The computational method employed in the present work may be further generalized to include the effect of molecular vibrations. Also, one may simulate the bridging molecule/quantum dot by several orbitals thus opening the way to studies of quantum interference effects. So, we believe that presented computational scheme and obtained results may be helpful for further understanding of thermoelectric properties of nanoscale systems.
