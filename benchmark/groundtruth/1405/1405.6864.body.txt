A uniqueness result for an inverse problem of the steady state convection-diffusion equation

Introduction

The steady state convection-diffusion equation

[formula]

can be seen as a time independent model for transport phenomena in a fluid due to a diffusion process and convection caused by the fluid velocity V. One specific model is heat transfer in a fluid, in which case u is taken as the temperature. In the following we will consider this problem assuming that [formula] and [formula], with 2 / 3  <  γ  ≤  1 and where the set [formula], n  ≥  3 will be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. Recall that the space of Hölder continuous functions, C0,γ(Ω), 0  <  γ  ≤  1 is defined as

[formula]

equipped with the norm

[formula]

A physical formulation of the inverse problem we are about to consider, is to think of u as the temperature in the region Ω, we then ask if it is possible to determine the velocity field V in the region Ω by controlling the temperature on the boundary and by measuring the heat flux on the boundary.

The boundary measurements are mathematically modeled by the so called Dirichlet to Neumann map (DN-map for short). This is the map ΛV taking f to [formula], where n is the outward pointing unit normal to [formula]. The unique solvability of the Dirichlet problem [\eqref=eq:conv_prob] in H1(Ω) (see Theorems 8.1 and 8.3 in [\cite=GT]) shows that the DN-map well defined. The normal derivative [formula] needs, however in this case to be understood in a distributional sense, because of the non-smooth solutions we consider. The DN-map can then be defined in a weak sense, as the operator [formula] given by

[formula]

where [formula], in Ω, u|Ω  =  f and [formula], φ∈H1(Ω), with [formula]. Here 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 denotes the distribution duality on [formula]. Notice also that the definition is independent of the choice of an extension φ of φ.

The mathematical form of the inverse problem is then the question, if the DN-map of the Dirichlet problem [\eqref=eq:conv_prob] determines the velocity field V. The main result of this paper is the following theorem.

Let [formula], j = 1,2 with 2 / 3  <  γ  ≤  1. Assume that ΛV1  =  ΛV2, then V1  =  V2 in Ω.

The first uniqueness result for the above inverse problem was given by Cheng, Nakamura and Sommersalo in [\cite=CNS], where they prove the unique determination of the velocity field V, for [formula], and [formula]. Salo improved this in [\cite=Sa], where it is shown that the result also holds when V is Lipschitz continuous, i.e. V∈C0,1(Ω). This was in turn improved by Knudsen and Salo in [\cite=KS] where they prove that V can be any Hölder continuous function provided that [formula]. Theorem [\ref=thm1] improves on this by showing that the restriction [formula], is unnecessary for Hölder continuous vector fields V∈C0,γ(Ω), when 2 / 3  <  γ  ≤  1.

The inverse problem of the closely related magnetic Schrödinger equation, was first studied by Sun in [\cite=S]. There have been several improvements of this result by various authors. The sharpest and most recent result is given by Krupchyk and Uhlmann in [\cite=KU] where they prove that the inverse problem is solvable for an electric potential q∈L∞ and a magnetic potential A∈L∞.

A first remark on Theorem [\ref=thm1] concerns its relations to the celebrated Calderon problem (see e.g. [\cite=SyU]). The Calderon problem asks if one can determine the conductivity in the interior of an object by measuring the current on the boundary, when one controls the voltage on the boundary (or vice versa), or in more mathematical terms if the DN-map corresponding to a Dirichlet problem of the conductivity equation [formula] where σ is the conductivity, determines the conductivity. Writing the conductivity equation in non-divergence form we get that

[formula]

This shows that the [\eqref=eq:conv_prob] is a more general and therefore a more difficult problem then the Calderon problem.

As a second remark on Theorem [\ref=thm1] we point out that the over all method of proving Theorem [\ref=thm1] is to reduce it to an inverse problem for the magnetic Schrödinger equation, which is a self-adjoint first order perturbation of the Laplacian. We will more specifically be utilizing the method of proving uniqueness for the inverse problem of the magnetic Schrödinger equation given in [\cite=KU]. One of the main ideas is that one can still use the methods of [\cite=KU] for electric potentials with worse regularity of a specific distributional form, provided one assumes that the magnetic potentials are more regular.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we reduce Theorem [\ref=thm1] to a claim about the magnetic Schrödinger operator. Section 3 is devoted to constructing complex geometric optics solutions. In section 4 we prove the unique determination of the magnetic field and in section 5 we prove the unique determination of the electric potential.

Reduction to the Magnetic Schrödinger case

The purpose of this section is to reduce Theorem [\ref=thm1] to a similar statement concerning the magnetic Schrödinger operator. The argument is formulated by Cheng, Nakamura and Sommersalo in [\cite=CNS] and by Salo in [\cite=Sa]. The magnetic Schrödinger operator is formally given by

[formula]

We are going to consider the case where [formula] and [formula], with [formula] and [formula]. Hence we need to understand LA,q in a distributional sense, as an operator LA,q:H1(Ω)  →  H- 1(Ω), given by

[formula]

where φ∈H1(Ω) and ψ∈H10(Ω).

The inverse problem for the magnetic Schrödinger operator we are about to consider comes from the Dirichlet Problem

[formula]

where f is in the Sobolev space [formula]. The normal component of the magnetic gradient on the boundary, [formula], here n denotes the outward pointing unit normal vector on ∂Ω, is in our case defined, following [\cite=KU], as the bounded linear map [formula] given by

[formula]

for any u∈H1(Ω) such that LA,qu  =  0 and any [formula], such that [formula]. The definition is independent of the choice of an extension φ of φ.

We shall consider the more general notion of a Cauchy data set, instead of the DN-map when dealing with the magnetic Schrödinger equation. The Cauchy data sets are the sets of boundary data of solutions, i.e.

[formula]

The magnetic field corresponding to a potential A is given by the 2-form dA, which is defined as

[formula]

this definition should be understood in the sense of non-smooth differential forms (a.k.a. currents).

Our aim is now to reduce Theorem [\ref=thm1] to the following Proposition, after which the rest of the paper is devoted to proving this Proposition.

Let [formula] be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. Assume that [formula], 2 / 3  <  γ  ≤  1, with A1 = A2 and F1 = F2 on [formula], and let [formula]. Assume that CA1,q1 = CA2,q2, then dA1  =  dA2 and [formula] in Ω.

The above result is a variation of the main result in [\cite=KU]. It differs from this by being applicable to lower regularity electric potentials (i.e. of the special distributional form), but it also by requires more regularity on the magnetic potentials.

Another more general point concerning the above result is that, we cannot in general hope to recover the magnetic potential A. This is because of the gauge invariance of the Cauchy data sets. If ψ∈C1,γ(Ω) and [formula], then [formula], i.e. it is possible to change the magnetic potentials without disturbing the boundary data (see Proposition [\ref=prop_gauge_1] in the appendix).

At several points we will need extensions of Hölder continuous functions to a larger set containing Ω. The following basic extension result on Hölder continuous functions will be used for this (see Theorem 3 on page 174 in [\cite=St] and Theorem 16.11 on page 342 in [\cite=CDK]).

Let [formula] be open set with Lipschitz boundary. Then there exists a continuous linear extension operator E,

[formula]

for [formula]. More precisley there exists a constant C = C(Ω) > 0, such that for every f∈C0,γ(Ω), [formula] is compact,

[formula]

and one has the norm estimate

[formula]

We will also need the following boundary reconstruction result from [\cite=Sa] (see Theorem 1.9 in [\cite=Sa]).

Let [formula] be open set with Lipschitz boundary and n  ≥  3. Assume [formula], 0 < γ  ≤  1. If ΛV1  =  ΛV2, then [formula].

Next we show how Theorem [\ref=thm1] follows from Proposition [\ref=thm2]. We follow the argument given in [\cite=Sa]. The rest of the paper will focus on proving Proposition [\ref=thm2].

Proof of Theorem [\ref=thm1]. By Theorem [\ref=bndry_rec] we know that V1 = V2 on [formula]. Lemma [\ref=HoldExt] allows us then to extend Vj to a ball B, Ω  ⊂    ⊂  B so that [formula], [formula] and V1 = V2 on [formula]. Lemma [\ref=lem_Cauchy_data_conv] below shows that the above extension does not alter the DN-maps, i.e. ΛBV1  =  ΛBV2. We may thus assume that that Ω  =  B and that V1 = V2 = 0 on [formula].

We now consider the magnetic Schrödinger operators LAj,qj, j = 1,2 that coincide with LVj. That is we choose

[formula]

which gives that LAj,qj  =  LVj.

Next we want to show that [formula]. We need only to show that NAj,qjuj  =  ΛVjuj, j = 1,2. Let uj∈H1(B) be such that LAj,qjuj  =  0 and assume that [formula] and that φ∈H1(B) is an extension of φ, i.e. [formula]. Then by definition and because Vj = 0 on [formula]

[formula]

The assumption that ΛV1  =  ΛV2, implies therefore that CA1,q1  =  CA2,q2.

We can now apply Proposition [\ref=thm2], which gives that dV1  =  dV2. By the Poincaré Lemma (see Theorem 8.3 in [\cite=CDK]), there exists an ψ∈C1,γ(B), s.t. [formula], since [formula] outside [formula], we have that ψ is constant near [formula]. We may hence add a constant to ψ, so that ψ  =  0 near [formula].

The second consequence of Proposition [\ref=thm2] is that q1  =  q2, so that [formula]. This together with the fact that [formula], gives the equation

[formula]

Next we prove that ψ∈C2(B). Because of [\eqref=eq:quasilin] we have that [formula] satisfies

[formula]

with [formula]. By interior Schauder estimates (see Theorem 7.18 in [\cite=Zw]) we know that [formula], for every open V  ⊂    ⊂  B. It follows that ψ∈C2(B).

We may now apply the maximum principle to ψ (see Theorem 10.1 in [\cite=GT]). From this it follows that ψ  =  0 in B, since [formula]. We may thus conclude that V1 = V2.

[formula]

Complex geometric optics solutions and remainder estimates

In this section we shortly review the construction of complex geometric optics (CGO for short) solutions and then derive some remainder estimates related to these. We follow by large the construction given in [\cite=KU]. We are however dealing with more regular magnetic potentials, which allows us to get the better remainder estimates that are needed. This and the more irregular electric potentials require us to make some modifications to the argument in [\cite=KU].

Smooth approximations of the potentials will be an important tool in the following. Our smoothing procedure will consist of an extension followed by a convolution with a mollifier. More specifically, given an [formula], we consider an open bounded set Ω', s.t. Ω  ⊂    ⊂  Ω'. By Lemma [\ref=HoldExt] there is an extension of A to [formula], [formula], s.t. A = A' in Ω, [formula] and

[formula]

Moreover let Ψ belong to [formula] with 0  ≤  Ψ(x)  ≤  1 for all [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Define Ψθ(x)  =  θnΨ(θx) for θ∈(0,  ∞  ) and [formula]. We define [formula] for any [formula], as

[formula]

Notice also that [\eqref=es:HoldContExt] implies that [formula], where C is independent of θ.

The following Lemma gives some basic and well known estimates for the above approximation scheme (see [\cite=H]).

Assume that [formula], with 0 < γ  ≤  1 and let A' be the above extension of A to [formula]. Then

[formula]

as θ  →    ∞  , for any multi-index α, with |α|  ≥  1.

Let Ψ be as above. Assume that [formula]. For the first estimate we use [\eqref=es:HoldContExt] and have that

[formula]

To derive the second estimate [\eqref=es:Asharp2] notice firstly that

[formula]

for all multi indexes α, with |α|  ≥  1. Let [formula], then using the above observation, we have that

[formula]

Remark. In the rest of this section we will consider A to be extended as A' outside Ω, i.e. we use A to denote the extension A'.

We will now show how to construct so called complex geometric optics solutions following the argument in [\cite=KU]. It is natural to formulate this in terms of certain semiclassical norms that are defined as follows

[formula]

The construction of CGO solutions is based on the solvability result below. The solvability result is in turn a consequence of a perturbed Carleman estimate, Proposition [\ref=PCE] in the appendix. The argument that shows how to obtain the solvability result from the Carleman estimate is standard and we refer to the proof of Proposition 2.3 in [\cite=KU].

Let [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Furthermore let φ(x)  =  α  ·  x, [formula] with |α| = 1. If h > 0 is small enough, then for any v∈H- 1(Ω), there is a solution of the equation

[formula]

which satisfies

[formula]

The CGO solutions u∈H1(Ω) considered here solve

[formula]

with [formula], [formula], [formula] and have the form

[formula]

where [formula] with ζ  ·  ζ = 0 and |ζ|  ~  1; h is a small semiclassical parameter; a is a smooth amplitude and r is a reminder term.

We begin by assuming that [formula], ζ  =  ζ0  +  ζ1 is such that

[formula]

Abbreviate the conjugated operator multiplied by h2, with

[formula]

Then in order to construct u(  ·  ;ζ,h) of the form [\eqref=eq:CGOform], it is enough to prove the existence of a r(  ·  ;ζ,h)∈H1(Ω) solving

[formula]

in Ω for a suitable a. The [formula] is picked as the solution to

[formula]

so that left hand side of [\eqref=eq:remainder] becomes, using [\eqref=eq:zetaAssum], [\eqref=eq:transport] and [\eqref=eq:conjMaMf] given below,

[formula]

Here mA and [formula] are the bounded linear operators from H1(Ω) to H- 1(Ω) defined by

[formula]

for all φ∈H1(Ω) and all ψ∈H10(Ω). It easy to see that

[formula]

If we look for solutions to [\eqref=eq:transport] in the form [formula], it will be enough that [formula] satisfies

[formula]

in [formula]. The fact that [formula] and [formula], implies that [formula] is a [formula]operator in suitable coordinates. The Cauchy operator N- 1ζ0, defined by

[formula]

for [formula] is the inverse of the [formula]operator and gives thus that

[formula]

We will also use the following basic continuity result for the Cauchy operator (see [\cite=Sa], Lemma 7.4).

Let [formula], k  ≥  0, with [formula]. Then we have that

[formula]

where C = C(R).

Using now Lemma [\ref=LemApprox] and Lemma [\ref=Cauchy_op], we have that

[formula]

for θ∈(1,  ∞  ) and a multi-indexes α, |α|  ≥  1. Moreover, defining [formula], solves analogously

[formula]

and satisfies

[formula]

Lemma [\ref=Cauchy_op] and estimate [\eqref=es:Asharp1] imply that the functions [formula] converge to Φ in L∞(Ω) or more explicitly that

[formula]

With the a at hand the solvability result, Proposition [\ref=solvability] guarantees the existence of a solution r, to equation [\eqref=eq:remainder], such that

[formula]

Now we determine how the left hand side of the above estimate depends on h, i.e. we estimate the [formula]-norm of the terms in equation [\eqref=eq:aparts]. This gives us the behaviour of the [formula]-norm of the remainder term r in the parameter h.

Let 0  ≠  ψ∈C∞0(Ω). Then using [\eqref=es:phi_sharp], the fact that ζ1  =  O(h) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we get that

[formula]

By Lemma [\ref=LemApprox] we have on the other hand that

[formula]

Again by Lemma [\ref=LemApprox] and estimate [\eqref=es:phi_sharp] we have that

[formula]

Similarly with the help of Lemma [\ref=LemApprox] and estimate [\eqref=es:phi_sharp] we have that

[formula]

Combining the above estimates gives that

[formula]

By choosing θ  =  h- 1 / 2, we get hence by estimate [\eqref=es:remNorm] that

[formula]

We have thus derived the following Proposition.

Let [formula], n  ≥  3, be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. Let [formula], 0  <  γ  ≤  1, [formula], with [formula] and let [formula] satisfy [\eqref=eq:zetaAssum]. Then for all h > 0 small enough, there exists a solution u(x,ζ;h)∈H1(Ω) of

[formula]

of the form [formula]. The function [formula] satisfies

[formula]

for all α, |α|  ≥  1, and [formula] converges in the L∞-norm to [formula]. More precisely

[formula]

The remainder r is such that

[formula]

as h  →  0.

Uniqueness of the magnetic field

This section contains a proof of the first part of Proposition [\ref=thm2], i.e. we show that dA1  =  dA2. We begin by stating an integral identity, which readily follows from the assumption that CA1,q1 = CA2,q2. The proof can be found in [\cite=KU] and only minor modifications are needed to make it work with electric potentials used here.

Let [formula], n  ≥  3, be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. Assume that [formula] and [formula], with 0  <  γ  ≤  1. If CA1,q1 = CA2,q2, then the following integral identity

[formula]

holds for any u1,u2∈H1(Ω) satisfying LA1,q1u1 = 0 in Ω and [formula] in Ω, respectively.

The idea is then to choose specific CGO solutions and insert them into the integral identity and then show that this reduces, in the limit h  →  0 to a specific Fourier transform. The CGO will be chosen as follows. Let [formula] be such that |μ1| = |μ2| = 1 and μ1  ·  μ2  =  μ1  ·  ξ  =  μ2  ·  ξ = 0. Define

[formula]

so that ζj  ·  ζj = 0, j = 1,2, and

[formula]

Here h > 0 is a small enough. Moreover, ζ1  =  μ1  +  iμ2  +  O(h) and ζ2  =    -  μ1  +  iμ2  +  O(h) as h  →  0.

For all h > 0, that are small enough there exists, by Proposition [\ref=CGOest] a solution u1(x,ζ1;h)∈H1(Ω) to the equation LA1,q1u1 = 0 in Ω, of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is given by

[formula]

and [formula] in [formula] as h  →  0, where Φ1 is given by Proposition [\ref=CGOest].

Similarly, for all h > 0 small enough, there exists a solution u2(x,ζ2;h)∈H1(Ω) to the equation [formula] in Ω, of the form

[formula]

where [formula] is given by

[formula]

and [formula] in [formula] as h  →  0, where Φ2 is given by Proposition [\ref=CGOest].

Notice also that we have by estimates [\eqref=es:phi_h_est] and [\eqref=es:r_h_est], of Proposition [\ref=CGOest], that

[formula]

for j = 1,2.

The next step is to insert the u1 and u2 specified above into [\eqref=eq:intId], multiply by h and let h  →  0, in an attempt to obtain a Fourier transform of the magnetic field. This is done in the next Lemma. The proof is based on the argument found in [\cite=KU]. The difference is however in how the electric potential is estimated. The crucial observation is that the last term in [\eqref=eq:intId] containing the electric potentials, goes to zero, in h when multiplied with an extra factor of h, even though it closely resembles the first term with the magnetic potentials, for which this does not happen.

For A1,A2,μ1,μ2 and ξ as above we have that

[formula]

We use the abbreviations A: = A1 - A2, F: = F1 - F2 and p: = p1 - p2. First we multiply [\eqref=eq:intId] by h. For the non-gradient terms in [\eqref=eq:intId] we have by [\eqref=es:r_h] that

[formula]

as h  →  0. For our specific CGO solutions, u1 and u2, we hence have that

[formula]

as h  →  0.

We continue by estimating the first integral in [\eqref=eq:modIntId]. Since the solutions u1 and u2 are of the CGO form one gets the following by expanding

[formula]

The first term in the first parantheses in [\eqref=eq:u1du2] gives

[formula]

as h  →  0. This is because [formula] and by [\eqref=es:PhiPhiSharp] we have that

[formula]

as h  →  0. For the next three terms in [\eqref=eq:u1du2], we can use estimate [\eqref=es:r_h] and Cauchy-Schwarz to conclude that

[formula]

as h  →  0. For the last part of [\eqref=eq:u1du2] containing the factor h, we have using estimates [\eqref=es:r_h] and [\eqref=es:phi_h] that

[formula]

as h  →  0. Expanding the [formula] term in [\eqref=eq:modIntId] gives

[formula]

Again -  ζ1 =  - μ1 - iμ2  +  O(h). The terms in [\eqref=eq:u1du2] and [\eqref=eq:u2du1] are of the same form. Doing the analogous estimates for [\eqref=eq:u2du1] gives then that

[formula]

as h  →  0.

We end the proof by showing that

[formula]

as h  →  0. Using [\eqref=eq:u1du2] and [\eqref=eq:u2du1] gives that

[formula]

The second term on the right hand side is of the same form as the second term on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:u1du2] and [\eqref=eq:u2du1]. The contribution of these terms are therefore zero in the limit h  →  0.

For the first term on the right hand side of [\eqref=eq:ududuu] we get, using [\eqref=eq:z1_plus_z2] and [\eqref=es:r_h], the estimate

[formula]

as [formula]. This shows that [\eqref=lim:Fpart] holds.

It turns out that the [formula] term can be dropped from [\eqref=eq:with_phases_R_n]. This is guaranteed by Proposition 3.3 in [\cite=KU] (see also [\cite=ER] and [\cite=S]). Using the abbreviation A: = A1 - A2 we thus obtain

[formula]

where Â stands for the Fourier transform of A. Moreover for any [formula], with μ  ·  ξ  =  0, we have therefore that μ  ·  Â = 0. It follows that the Fourier transform of the component functions of [\eqref=eq:magDef] are zero. To see this notice that the above implies that

[formula]

since ξ  ·  (ξjek  -  ξkej)  =  0, where ek denote the standard basis vectors of [formula]. We have thus proved that dA1  =  dA2.

Remark. Notice that, we only need the condition 0 < γ  ≤  1 in recovering the magnetic potentials, instead of 2 / 3 < γ  ≤  1.

Uniqueness of the electric potential

To finish the proof of Proposition [\ref=thm2], we need to show that [formula]. Lemma [\ref=HoldExt] and the assumption that A1 = A2, F1 = F2 on [formula] and that [formula] is Lipschitz, allows us to extend Aj and Fj, j = 1,2 to a ball B, with [formula], so that A1  =  A2 and F1  =  F2 in [formula], Fj  =  Aj  =  0 on [formula] and Aj,Fj∈C0,γ(B), for j = 1,2.

In the previous section we proved that d(A1 - A2)  =  0. The Poincaré Lemma implies now that there is a ψ∈C1,γ(B) s.t. [formula] in B (see [\cite=CDK]). We can moreover choose ψ so that [formula], since A1 = A2 = 0 in [formula]. By Lemma [\ref=lem_Cauchy_data] and Proposition [\ref=prop_gauge_1] below, we have that

[formula]

Proposition [\ref=int_identity] gives then that

[formula]

for any u1,u2∈H1(B), satisfying LA1,q1u1 = 0, [formula] in B and where F: = F1 - F2 and p: = p1 - p2.

We now suppose, as in section [\ref=sec:magUniq] that u1 and u2 are given by [\eqref=eq_u_1] and [\eqref=eq_u_2] (when Ω  =  B), with A1 = A2 and consider the limit of [\eqref=eq:redIntId] as h  →  0. Expanding [\eqref=eq:redIntId], using [\eqref=eq:z1_plus_z2] gives

[formula]

We begin by showing that the second integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] tends to zero, in the limit h  →  0.

We simplify [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] firstly by writing [formula]. Notice also that [formula]. The second simplification comes from the fact that [formula]. To show this notice first that the Cauchy operator has the following properties

[formula]

Applying these to the definitions [\eqref=eq_phi_1_sharp_def] and [\eqref=eq_phi_2_sharp_def] together with the fact that we are now considering the case with A1  =  A2 yields

[formula]

so that

[formula]

Split the second integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] into pieces by taking the absolute value and applying the triangle inequality. Consider first the first term of the second integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt]. By [\eqref=eq:simp2] we have immediately that

[formula]

Next we consider the terms [formula] and [formula], coming from the second integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt]. Notice firstly that [formula], since [formula]. Letting [formula], where Ψθ is defined as in the beginning of section [\ref=sec:cgo] and using the estimates of Proposition [\ref=CGOest] and Lemma [\ref=LemApprox] we get that

[formula]

The last term from the second integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] is handled as follows

[formula]

Combining [\eqref=es:Fp1], [\eqref=es:Fp2] and [\eqref=es:Fp3] and then choosing θ  =  h- 1, gives for the second integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] that

[formula]

as h  →  0, since we require that γ  >  2 / 3.

We now return to the first integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt]. It can be estimated using [\eqref=es:r_h] and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as follows

[formula]

as h  →  0. Estimating the third integral in [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] in a simliar fashion and using [\eqref=eq:simp2] we thus conclude that [\eqref=eq:expIdInt] reduces to

[formula]

in the limit h  →  0. This implies that [formula] in the distributional sense, which in turn implies that [formula], finishing the proof of Proposition [\ref=thm2].

Appendix A - Gauge invariance and Boundary data

Gauge invariance plays an important role when working with the magnetic Schrödinger equation. Here we state the basic result concerning the gauge invariance of the Cauchy data sets. This section also includes two results on when the equality of the boundary data on a smaller set implies the equality of the boundary data on a bigger set.

Let [formula], n  ≥  3, be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. Assume [formula], 0  <  γ  ≤  1, [formula], [formula] and let [formula] . Then we have

[formula]

If furthermore, [formula] then

[formula]

Let ψ∈C1,γ(Ω). By direct computation we know that for LA,p, we have

[formula]

Furthermore we have that

[formula]

since for u,v∈C∞0(Ω), we have that

[formula]

where 〈  ·  ,  ·  〉 stands for the distributional duality. Thus recalling that [formula] it follows that

[formula]

which proves [\eqref=eq:conj_lem].

In order to prove [\eqref=eq:conj_lem_2], assume that [formula]. Let u∈H1(Ω) be a solution to

[formula]

By [\eqref=eq:conj_lem] we know that e- iψu∈H1(Ω) satisfies

[formula]

Moreover we have that [formula]. It remains hence to show that

[formula]

To that end let [formula] and let φ∈H1(Ω) be such that [formula]. Then

[formula]

The next Lemma is a slight modification of Lemma 4.2 in [\cite=Sa], we include the proof for the convenience of the reader. The Lemma shows that two DN-maps that coincide on small set, give two DN-maps that coincide on a bigger if we extend the potentials so that they are identical outside the smaller set.

Assume that [formula] be bounded open sets with Lipschitz boundaries, such that [formula] and let [formula]. Denote by ΛΩVj the DN-map corresponding to the Dirichlet problem on the set Ω. Assume that V1 = V2 in [formula]. If ΛΩV1  =  ΛΩV2 then ΛΩ'V1  =  ΛΩ'V2.

Given u1'∈H1(Ω'), solving LV1u1'  =  0, in Ω' we need to find an u2'∈H1(Ω') solving LV2u2'  =  0, in Ω' with [formula] and [formula].

The function u1: = u1'|Ω solves LV1u1  =  0, in Ω. Let u2∈H1(Ω) be such that LV2u2  =  0 in Ω and [formula]. We know that [formula], since ΛΩV1  =  ΛΩV2. Thus u1  -  u2∈H10(Ω). Define

[formula]

where we extended by u1  -  u2 by zero into Ω'. Clearly u2'∈H1(Ω'), [formula] and [formula].

It remains to check that LV2u2'  =  0, in Ω' in a weak sense. Let φ∈C∞0(Ω'), then

[formula]

where we use the fact that [formula], u1  =  u1'|Ω and ΛΩV1  =  ΛΩV2 to get the fourth equality.

We need a similar result concerning the magnetic Schrödinger operator.

Let [formula] be bounded open sets with Lipschitz boundaries, such that [formula]. Let [formula], 0 < γ  ≤  1, [formula] and let [formula]. Denote by CΩAj,qj the Cauchy data for LAj,qj in the set Ω, j = 1,2. Assume that

[formula]

If CΩA1,q1 = CΩA2,q2 then CΩ'A1,q1 = CΩ'A2,q2.

Given u1'∈H1(Ω'), solving LA1,q1u1'  =  0, in Ω' we need to find an u2'∈H1(Ω') solving LA2,q2u2'  =  0, in Ω' with [formula] and NA2,q2u2'  =  NA1,q1u1'. This implies that CΩ'A1,q1  ⊂  CΩ'A2,q2, from which the claim follows.

Let u1: = u1'|Ω. Then LA1,q1u1  =  0, in Ω. Let u2∈H1(Ω) be such that LA2,q2u2  =  0, in Ω and [formula]. Because CΩA1,q1 = CΩA2,q2, we know that NA2,q2u2  =  NA1,q1u1, on [formula].

In particular we have that φ: = u2  -  u1∈H10(Ω)  ⊂  H10(Ω'). Define

[formula]

where we extended by u1  -  u2 by zero into Ω'. Clearly u2'∈H1(Ω'), [formula]. We need thus to check that LA2,q2u2'  =  0, in Ω' and that NA2,q2u2'  =  NA1,q1u1'.

Let ψ∈C∞0(Ω'), then

[formula]

Since u1' + φ  =  u2 on Ω, we have that

[formula]

The last integral is zero, since [formula]. Hence using the assumption that NA2,q2u2  =  NA1,q1u1, on [formula] gives

[formula]

Thus we see that LA2,q2u2'  =  0, in Ω'.

A similar deduction shows that NA2,q2u2'  =  NA1,q1u1'. Hence we have that CΩ'A1,q1  ⊂  CΩ'A2,q2.

Appendix B - A Carleman estimate

In this section we prove a Carleman estimate that implies the solvability result Proposition [\ref=solvability], in section [\ref=sec:cgo]. The proof is a straight forward extension of the one in [\cite=KU], and we give it here for the convenience of the reader. The main concern is how to incorporate the [formula] term into the result in [\cite=KU].

The estimate we are about to prove is a perturbation of the Carleman estimate for the Laplacian, given in [\cite=STz] (see also [\cite=KU]). We state this result as follows.

Let φ(x)  =  α  ·  x, [formula], |α|  =  1 and let [formula]. Then for 0 < h  ≪  ε  ≪  1 and [formula], we have

[formula]

for all u∈C∞0(Ω).

We now apply this result in the case s =  - 1 and a fixed ε > 0 that is sufficiently small.

Let φ(x)  =  α  ·  x, [formula] with |α|  =  1. Assume [formula], [formula] and [formula]. Then for 0 < h  ≪  1, we have

[formula]

for all u∈C∞0(Ω).

Let [formula] be the convexified weight, with ε > 0 and 0 < h  ≪  ε  ≪  1. Then in the proof Proposition 2.2 in [\cite=KU], it is shown that

[formula]

where [formula]. Here the implicit constant depends on [formula], [formula] and [formula] (see (2.4) in [\cite=KU]).

Furthermore, we have for all 0  ≠  ψ∈C∞0(Ω) that

[formula]

It follows from the definition of the [formula]-norm that

[formula]

By choosing a small fixed ε > 0 that is independent of h, we conclude from estimates [\eqref=eq:CE_lap],[\eqref=eq:AA_est] and [\eqref=eq:Fterm_est] that

[formula]

Moreover we have that

[formula]

Combining the two previous estimates gives then that

[formula]

where C > 0. By using e-  φε / hu  =  e-  φ/he-  φ2 / (2ε)u, we obtain [\eqref=eq:CE_schr].
