Comment on "Scalar Einstein-Aether theory"

A recent paper [\cite=Haghani2014a] studies a modification of Einstein-aether theory [\cite=Jacobson2001] in which the aether vector is restricted, at the level of the action, to be the gradient of a scalar, [formula], constrained to be a timelike unit vector. In this comment we note that this scalar version of Einstein-aether theory, referred to here as S-theory for brevity, is equivalent to the projectable version of the IR limit of Hoava gravity [\cite=Horava2009] when the potential V(S) is constant. The covariant formulation of projectable Hoava gravity provided by S-theory was first described by [\cite=Blas2009]. In this comment we briefly explain the relation to nonprojectable Hoava gravity and to Einstein-aether theory.

It has previously been shown [\cite=Blas2009] [\cite=Jacobson2010a] that the nonprojectable version of IR-Hoava gravity is obtained from the Einstein-aether action with the aether required to be hypersurface orthogonal. That is, in the action the aether is of the form [formula], where T is a scalar field and N is chosen so that ua has unit norm. We refer to this as T-theory. The unit norm constraint may be implemented either by setting [formula] in the action, or by a constraint term λ(uaua  -  1) with Lagrange multiplier λ. The scalar T serves to define the preferred foliation that is central to Hoava gravity, and N corresponds to the lapse function. Since the T equation of motion follows from the other equations of motion, T may be set equal to the coordinate time in the action, resulting in the action for nonprojectable IR-Hoava gravity [\cite=Jacobson2010a].

S-theory is equivalent to T-theory with the further restriction that [formula] for some scalar field S. This restriction implies that N = N(T), i.e. N depends on spacetime only via T, which is precisely the projectability condition for the lapse function. The unit constraint then cannot be solved by a choice of N, since for a generic T the required N would not be just a function of T, but rather must be imposed by the constraint term [formula]. In this formulation of projectable Hoava gravity, the T reparameterization symmetry under which [formula] is invariant reduces to the shift symmetry S  →  S + .

The general action considered in Ref. [\cite=Haghani2014a] includes a potential term V(S). This is incompatible with the S shift symmetry unless V is constant, in which case it is just a cosmological constant. When a non-constant potential of this sort is included the theory is therefore no longer dynamically equivalent to projectable IR Hoava gravity.
