A note of clarification: BICEP2 and Planck are not in tension

The pivot scale confusion

A generic prediction of the inflationary paradigm is that the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra from inflation are nearly scale invariant. The deviation from scale invariance is then quantified by specifying a spectral index n and possibly a running α at a pivot scale k*. The primordial power spectra are then given by

[formula]

where [formula] and [formula]. The primordial tensor amplitude At is, by convention, always substituted for the ratio

[formula]

evaluated at a given scale kr, which is often, but not always, taken to be k*. The analysis of the temperature anisotropies by the Planck collaboration [\cite=Ade:2013zuv] was done at a pivot scale [formula], but their reported constraint r  <  0.11 at 95% Confidence Level (CL) was given at [formula]. The BICEP2 collaboration [\cite=Ade:2014xna], on the other hand, reported the amplitude r  =  0.20+ 0.07- 0.05 at 68% CL, evaluated at the Planck pivot scale [formula]. To avoid any confusion, it is then convenient to denote the tensor-to-scalar ratios evaluated at [formula] and [formula] by r0.05 and r0.002 respectively. That BICEP2 indeed has r0.05 = 0.2 as best fit becomes evident in Fig. [\ref=fig:BicepFit], where the low-[formula] B-mode angular power spectrum are plotted for r0.05  =  0.2 (red lines) and r0.002  =  0.2 (blue lines), considering for both cases nt  =  0, and assuming αs  =  αt  =  0. The r0.002  =  0.2 curve is clearly not a good fit to the data points given by BICEP2.

The likelihood confusion

The confusion related to the scale kr is enhanced by the following circumstances: i) the BICEP2 collaboration used a different likelihood in their own analyses than the publicly released Python likelihood code, and ii) the best-fit of the public code is actually r0.002  =  0.2, and not r0.05  =  0.2 as found in the BICEP2 analysis. This difference in best-fit is due to two separate facts: a) different methods are being used for computing the likelihood, the public one using the Hamimeche & Lewis code, whereas the private one uses the formula introduced in [\cite=Barkats:2013jfa], paragraph 9.3.1, and b) the public code uses information from all nine bandpower bins, whereas the internal one makes use of only the five first ones.

It should be noted that the difference between the best-fit values of the two likelihoods is well below 1σ. So this is not alarming in any way, but it leads nonetheless to an overestimation of the tension with Planck when using the public code.

In conclusion, the only data product matching exactly the BICEP2 internal analysis is the tabulated likelihood, obtained for a fixed cosmology with different values of r0.05, represented in green in the top panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:posteriors]. This corresponds to the advertised value of r0.05  =  0.20+ 0.07- 0.05. Reference [\cite=Ade:2014xna] also discusses several dust models, retaining DDM2 (Data Driven Model 2) as the most plausible one. After removing the DDM2 contamination, the BICEP2 collaboration obtains r0.05  =  0.16+ 0.06- 0.05 (68% CL). In the lower panel of Fig. [\ref=fig:posteriors] we present an approximative r posterior after dust removal.

Comparison with Planck

Using Eqs. [\eqref=eq:scalar] and [\eqref=eq:tensor], one can convert r0.05 from BICEP2 to r0.002 for comparison with Planck, or vice versa. For instance, the r0.05  =  0.2 curve in Fig. [\ref=fig:BicepFit], which is the best fit to the data (for nt  =  αt  =  αs  =  0), is equivalent to r0.002≃0.177. However, this would still be an 'apples to oranges' comparison, since the Planck analysis used a tensor spectral index inferred from the single-field slow-roll consistency condition nt  =   - r / 8, while BICEP2 used nt  =  0. This means that the underlying tensor primordial spectra was not of the same form, so it is in principle meaningless to compare the two parameters: If one experiment fits y  =  a0  +  a1x to the data while the other fits y  =  b0, we certainly should not compare a0 and b0.

We derived the posterior probability for r0.05 assuming a flat [formula] model and the Planck+WP dataset. In any Bayesian parameter extraction, the posterior depends on the choice of prior. Here, we choose to restrict ourselves to physical models by imposing a prior r0.05  ≥  0 (a different choice is advocated in the recent analysis of [\cite=Smith:2014kka]). After running the class and Monte Python codes, we obtained r0.05  <  0.135 at 95% CL, which is not in significant tension with the BICEP2 result, as shown in Fig. [\ref=fig:posteriors]. Even before subtracting the dust model, the two posteriors overlap at the 9% CL (corresponding to 1.7σ). After removing dust contamination (under the DDM2 assumption), the compatibility increases to the level of 17%, corresponding to a 1.3σ overlap.

With such an overlap between the two likelihoods, we can conclude (even without calculating Bayesian evidence ratios) that there is no compelling reason at the moment to invoke extra ingredients in the cosmological model, in order to alleviate a would-be tension between the Planck 2013 and BICEP2 measurements. In particular, there is no convincing case for introducing a non-zero scalar running αs of the order of - 0.02, which would be incompatible with the simplest and most elegant slow-roll inflationary paradigm.
