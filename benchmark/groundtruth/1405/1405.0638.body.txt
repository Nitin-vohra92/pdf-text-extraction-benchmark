THE UNIVERSE ASA QUANTUM COMPUTER

Introduction

One frequently hears people say that the universe acts like a giant quantum computer, but when pressed they are usually short on details. This article attempts to begin giving these details. It should be emphasized that only a basic framework is presented and much work remains to be done. If this idea is correct, then great benefits will result. One benefit being better understanding of the universe itself and another is the ability to tap into a source of enormous computational power.

We first present a theory of discrete quantum gravity in terms of causal sets (causets) [\cite=gud13] [\cite=sor03] [\cite=sur11]. Unlike previous sequential growth models the basic elements of this theory are a special type of causet called a covariant causet (c-causet). A c-causet is defined to be a causet that is independent of its labeling. That is, two different labelings of a c-causet are isomorphic. The restriction of a growth model to c-causets provides great simplifications. For example, every c-causet possesses a unique c-causet history and has precisely two covariant offspring. It follows that there are 2n c-causets of cardinality n + 1. This enables us to classify c-causets of cardinality n + 1 in terms of n-bits. The framework of a classical computer is already emerging. We characterize c-causets as those causets that form a multipartite graph or equivalently those causets whose elements are comparable whenever their heights are different.

We next quantize the model by introducing a quantum sequential growth process. This is accomplished by replacing the n-bits with n-qubits and defining transition amplitudes for the growth transitions. The transition amplitudes are given by complex-valued coupling constants cn,j, [formula]. If the coupling constants are independent of j, we call the process stationary and if they are independent of n and j we call the process completely stationary. We show that for stationary processes the probability operators that determine the quantum dynamics are tensor products of rank-1 qubit operators. Moreover, the converse of this result holds. Simplifications occur for completely stationary processes. In this case, all the qubit operators are the same and can be related to spin operators. We close with some examples of precluded events in the completely stationary case.

Covariant Causets

In this article we call a finite partially ordered set a causet. If two causets are order isomorphic, we consider them to be identical. If a and b are elements of a causet x, we interpret the order a < b as meaning that b is in the causal future of a and a is in the causal past of b. An element a∈x is maximal if there is no b∈x with a < b. If a < b and there is no c∈x with a < c < b, then a is a parent of b and b is a child of a. If a,b∈x we say that a and b are comparable if a  ≤  b or b  ≤  a. A chain in x is a set of mutually comparable elements of x and an antichain is a set of mutually incomparable elements of x. The height of a∈x is the cardinality of the longest chain whose largest element is a. The height of x is the maximum of the heights of its elements. We denote the cardinality of x by [formula].

If x and y are causets with [formula], then x produces y if y is obtained from x by adjoining a single maximal element a to x. In this case we write [formula] and use the notation x  →  y. If x  →  y, we also say that x is a producer of y and y is an offspring of x. In general, x may produce many offspring and y may be the offspring of many producers.

A labeling for a causet x is a bijection [formula] such that a,b∈x with a < b implies that [formula]. A labeled causet is a pair [formula] where [formula] is a labeling of x. For simplicity, we frequently write [formula] and call x an [formula]-causet. Two [formula]-causets x and y are isomorphic if there exists a bijection φ:x  →  y such that a < b if and only if φ(a) < φ(b) and [formula] for every a∈x. Isomorphic [formula]-causets are considered identical as [formula]-causets. It is not hard to show that any causet can be labeled in many different ways but there are exceptions and these are the ones of importance in this work. A causet is covariant if it has a unique labeling (up to [formula]-causet isomorphism). Covariance is a strong restriction which says that the elements of the causet have a unique "birth order" up to isomorphism. We call a covariant causet a c-coset.

We denote the set of c-causets with cardinality n by Pn and the set of all c-causets by [formula]. Notice that any nonempty c-causet y has a unique producer. Indeed, if y had two different producers x1,x2 then x1 and x2 could be labeled differently and these could be used to give different labelings for y. If x∈P, then the parent-child relation [formula] makes x into a graph [formula]. A graph G is multipartite if there is a partition of its vertices [formula] such that the vertices of Vj and Vj + 1 are adjacent and there are no other adjacencies.

The following statements for a causet x are equivalent. (a) x is covariant, (b) the graph [formula] is multipartite, (c) a,b∈x are comparable whenever a and b have different heights.

Conditions (b) and (c) are clearly equivalent. To prove that (a) implies (b), suppose x is covariant and let [formula] where yi is the set of elements in x of height i. Suppose a∈yn, b∈yn + 1 and [formula]. We can delete maximal elements of y until b is maximal and the only element of height n + 1. Denote the resulting causet by z. We can label b by [formula], a by [formula] and consistently label the other elements of z so that z is an [formula]-causet. We can also label b by [formula], a by [formula] and keep the same labels for the other elements of z. This gives two nonisomorphic labelings of z. Adjoining maximal elements to z to obtain x, we have x with two nonisomorphic labelings which is a contradiction. Hence, a < b so a is a parent of b. It follows that x is multipartite. To prove that (b) implies (a), suppose the graph [formula] is multipartite. Letting [formula] where yi is the set of elements of height i, it follows that a < b for all a∈yi, b∈yi + 1, [formula]. We can write

[formula]

where j is the label on aj. This gives a labeling of x and is the only labeling up to isomorphism.

If x∈P, then x has precisely two covariant offspring.

By Theorem [\ref=thm21], the graph [formula] is multipartite. Suppose x has height n. Let [formula] where a has all the elements of height n as parents. Then a is the only element of x1 with height n + 1. Hence, x1 is multipartite so by Theorem [\ref=thm21], x1 is a covariant offspring of x. Let [formula] where b has all the elements of height n - 1 in x as parents. (If n = 1, then b has no parents.) It is clear that x2 is a multipartite graph. By Theorem [\ref=thm21], x2 is a covariant offspring of x. Also, there is only one covariant offspring of each of these two types. Let [formula] be a covariant offspring of x that is not one of these two types and let a∈x have label [formula]. Then a and c are incomparable and we can label x by [formula]. If we interchange the labels of a and c, we get a nonisomorphic labeling of y which gives a contradiction. We conclude that x has precisely two covariant offspring.

There are 2n c-causets of cardinality n + 1.

Notice that we obtain all c-causets from the producer-offspring process of Theorem [\ref=thm22]. Indeed, take any x∈P and delete maximal elements until we arrive at the one element c-causet. In this way, x is obtained from the process of Theorem [\ref=thm22]. We now employ induction on n. There are 1 = 21 - 1 c-causets of cardinality 1. If the result holds for c-causets of cardinality n, then by Theorem [\ref=thm22] there are [formula] c-causets of cardinality n + 1. Hence, the result holds for c-causets of cardinality n + 1.

As a bonus we obtain an already known combinatorial identity. A composition of a positive integer n is a sequence of positive integers whose sum is n. The order of terms in the sequence is taken into account. For example the following are the compositions of 1,2,3,4,5.

[formula]

The reader has surely noticed that for n = 1,2,3,4,5, the number of compositions of n is 2n - 1.

There are 2n - 1 compositions of the positive integer n.

There is a bijection between compositions of n and multipartite graphs with n vertices. The result follows from Corollary [\ref=cor23].

The pair (P,  →  ) forms a partially ordered set in its own right. Moreover, (P,  →  ) also forms a graph that is a tree. Figure 1 depicts the first five levels of this tree. The binary designations in Figure 1 will now be explained. By Corollary [\ref=cor23], at height n + 1 there are 2n c-causets so binary numbers fit well, but how do we define a natural order for the c-causets? We have seen in Theorem [\ref=thm22] that if x∈Pn, [formula], then x has precisely two offspring in P, x  →  x0,x1 here x0 has the same height as x and x1 has the height of x plus one. We call x0 the 0-offspring and x1 the 1-offspring of x. We assign a binary order to x∈P recursively as follows. If x∈P1, then x is the unique one element c-causet and we designate x by 0. If x∈Pn + 1, then x has a unique producer y∈Pn. Suppose y has binary order [formula], ji = 0 or 1. If x is the 0-offspring of y, then we designate x with [formula] and if x is a 1-offspring of y, then we designate x with [formula]. The reader can now check this definition with the binary order in Figure 1.

We now see the beginning development of a giant classical computer. At the (n + 1)th step of the process, n-bit strings are generated. It is estimated that we are now at about the 1060th step so (1060 - 1)-bit strings are being generated. There are about 21060 such strings so an enormous amount of information is being processed. When we get to quantum computers, then superpositions of strings will be possible and the amount of information increases exponentially. It is convenient to employ the notation for an n-bit string. In this way we can designate each x∈P uniquely by xn + 1, where [formula]. For example, the c-causets at step 3 in Figure 1 are x3,00,x3,01,x3,10,x3,11. In decimal notation we can also write these as x3,0,x3,1x3,2,x3,3.

The binary order that we have just discussed in equivalent to a natural order in terms of the c-causet structure. Let [formula] where we can assume without loss of generality that j is the label of aj, [formula]. Define Thus, [formula] is the set of labels of the descendants of aj. Order the set of c-cosets in Pn lexicographically as follows. If x,y∈Pn, then x < y if It is easy to check that <   is a total order relation on Pn. The next theorem, whose proof we leave to the reader, shows that the order <   on Pn is equivalent to the binary order previously discussed.

If xn,,xn,∈Pn, then xn < xn, if and only if   <  .

Quantum Sequential Growth Processes

The tree (P,  →  ) can be thought of as a growth model and an x∈Pn is a possible universe at step (time) n. An instantaneous universe x grows one element at a time in one of two ways at each step. A path in P is a sequence (string) [formula] where ωi∈Pi and ωi  →  ωi + 1. An n-path is a finite sequence [formula] where again ωi∈Pi and ωi  →  ωi + 1. We denote the set of paths by Ω and the set of n-paths by Ωn. We think of ω∈Ω as a "completed" universe or as a universal history. We may also view ω∈Ω as an evolving universe. Since a c-causet has a unique producer, an n-path [formula] is completely determined by ωn. In other words, a c-causet possesses a unique history. We can thus identify Ωn with Pn and we write Ωn  ≈  Pn. If [formula] we denote by ω  →  ) the two element subset of Ωn + 1 consisting of [formula] where x0 and x1 are the offspring of ωn. Thus, If A  ⊆  Ωn we define (A  →  )  ⊆  Ωn + 1 by Thus, (A  →  ) is the set of one-element continuations of n-paths in A.

The set of all paths beginning with ω∈Ωn is called an elementary cylinder set and is denoted by [formula]. If A  ⊆  Ωn, then the cylinder set [formula] is defined by Using the notation we see that is an increasing sequence of subalgebras of the cylinder algebra [formula]. Letting A be the σ-algebra generated by C(Ω), we have that (Ω,A) is a measurable space. For A  ⊆  Ω we define the sets An  ⊆  Ωn by That is, An is the set of n-paths that can be continued to a path in A. We think of An as the n-step approximation to A. We have that so that [formula]. However, [formula] in general, even if A∈A.

Let Hn = L2(Ωn) = L2(Pn) be the n-path Hilbert space [formula] with the usual inner product For A  ⊆  Ωn, the characteristic function χA∈Hn has norm [formula]. In particular 1n  =  χΩn satisfies A positive operator ρ on Hn that satisfies [formula] is called a probability operator [\cite=gud13]. Corresponding to a probability operator ρ we define the decoherence functional [\cite=gud13] [\cite=hen09] [\cite=sor07] by [formula]. We interpret Dρ(A,B) as a measure of the interference between the events A and B when the system is described by ρ. We also define the q-measure [formula] by μρ(A) = Dρ(A,A) and interpret μρ(A) as the quantum propensity of the event A  ⊆  Ωn [\cite=gud13] [\cite=sor94] [\cite=sur11]. In general, μρ is not additive on 2Ωn so μρ is not a measure. However, μρ is grade-2 additive [\cite=gud13] [\cite=sor94] [\cite=sur11] in the sense that if A,B,C∈2Ωn are mutually disjoint, then Let ρn be a probability operator on Hn, [formula]. We say that the sequence [formula] is consistent if for all A,B  ⊆  Ωn [\cite=gud13]. We call a consistent sequence [formula] a covariant quantum sequential growth process (CQSGP). Let ρn be a CQSGP and denote the corresponding q-measure by μn. A set A∈A is suitable if lim μn(An) exists (and is finite) in which case we define μ(A) =  lim μn(An). We denote the collection of suitable sets by S(Ω). Of course, [formula] with [formula], μ(Ω = 1. If A∈C(Ω) and [formula] where B  ⊆  Ωm, then it follows from consistency that lim μn(An) = μm(B). Hence, A∈S(Ω) and μ(A) = μm(B). We conclude that C(Ω)  ⊆  S(Ω)  ⊆  A and it can be shown that the inclusions are proper, in general. In a sense, μ is a q-measure on S(Ω) that extends the q-measures μn.

There are physically relevant sets that are not in C(Ω). In this case, it is important to know whether such a set A is in S(Ω) and if it is, to find μ(A). For example, if ω∈Ω then but [formula]. As another example, the complement [formula]. Even if [formula], since μn(A')  ≠  1 - μn(A) for A  ⊆  Ωn in general, it does not follow immediately that [formula]. For this reason, we would have to treat [formula] as a separate case.

We saw in Section 2 that we can represent each element of P uniquely as xn, where [formula] and [formula] can be considered as a binary number. We can also represent each element in Pn + 1 as a n-bit binary number [formula], j = 0 or 1. Since Ωn  ≈  Pn we can also represent each ω∈Ωn + 1 by an n-bit binary number [formula]. The standard basis for Hn + 1 = L2(Ωn + 1) is the set of vectors [formula], [formula]. We frequently use the notation [formula] which is called the computational basis in quantum computation theory. In this theory [formula] is represented by where [formula] is [formula] or [formula] which form the basis of the two-dimensional Hilbert space [formula].

The basis vectors [formula] and [formula] are called qubit states but we shall call them qubits, for short. We also call [formula] given above, an n-qubit. This is the quantum computation analogue of an n-bit of classical computer science. If ρn + 1 is a probability operator, the corresponding decoherence matrix is the 2n  ×  2n complex matrix whose   -   component is given by This is frequently shortened to but we shall not use this notation because it can be confusing. For A,B  ⊆  Ωn + 1 we form the superpositions

[formula]

The decoherence functional is now given by Superpositions are a strictly quantum phenomenon that has no counterpart in classical computation.

An event A  ⊆  Ωn is precluded if μn(A) = 0 [\cite=sor94]. Precluded events have been extensively studied in [\cite=gtw9] [\cite=hen09] [\cite=sor03] [\cite=sur11] [\cite=wal13] and they are considered to be events that never occur. We shall give simple examples later which show that if A is precluded and B  ⊆  A then B need not be precluded. However, the following properties do hold.

(a) If A  ⊆  Ωn is precluded and B  ⊆  Ωn is disjoint from A then [formula]. (b) If A,B  ⊆  Ωn are disjoint precluded events then [formula] is precluded.

(a) Since μn(A) = 0 we have that Hence, ρ1 / 2nχA = 0 so ρnχA = 0. Since [formula] we have that

[formula]

Part (b) follows from (a).

An event A∈S(Ω) is precluded if μ(A) = 0 and A is strongly precluded if there exists an [formula] such that μm(Am) = 0 for all m  ≥  n. For example, if [formula] where B  ⊆  Ωn and μn(B) = 0 then A is strongly precluded. Of course, strongly precluded events are precluded.

A precluded event is primitive if it has no proper, nonempty precluded subsets.

If A  ⊆  Ωn is precluded, then A is primitive or A is a union of mutually disjoint primitive precluded events.

If A is primitive we are finished. Otherwise, there exists a proper, nonempty precluded subset B  ⊆  A. Since [formula] there exists a nonempty, primitive precluded event A1  ⊆  B  ⊆  A. Applying Theorem [\ref=thm31], we conclude that [formula]. In a similar way, there exists a nonempty, primitive precluded event [formula]. Of course, [formula]. Continuing, this process must eventually stop and we obtain a sequence of mutually disjoint primitive preluded events [formula] with [formula].

Covariant Amplitude Processes

This section considers a method of constructing a CQSGP called a covariant amplitude process. Not all CQSGPs can be constructed in this way, but this method appears to have physical motivation [\cite=gud13].

A transition amplitude is a map [formula] such that [formula] if [formula] and [formula] for all x∈P. This is similar to a Markov chain except [formula] may be complex. The covariant amplitude process (CAP) corresponding to [formula] is given by the maps [formula] where We can consider an to be a vector in Hn = L2(Ωn) = L2(Pn). Notice that for x∈Pn we can define an(x) to be an(ω) where ω∈Ωn is the unique history of x. Observe that and we also have that Define the rank-1 positive operator [formula] on Hn. The norm of ρn is Since [formula], we conclude that ρn is a probability operator. It is shown in [\cite=gud13] that [formula] is consistent so [formula] forms a CQSGP. We call [formula] the CQSGP generated by the CAP [formula].

The decoherence functional corresponding to the CAP [formula] becomes

[formula]

In particular, for ω,ω'∈Ωn the decoherence matrix elements are the matrix elements of ρn in the standard basis. The q-measure [formula] is given by In particular, [formula] for every ω∈Ωn and μn(Ωn) = 1. Of course, we also have that [formula] for all x∈Pn.

Since each x∈Pn has precisely two offspring, we can describe a transition amplitude [formula] and the corresponding CAP [formula] in a simple way. Let

[formula]

[formula]. We call the numbers [formula] coupling constants for the corresponding CAP [formula].

We shall only need a special case of the next theorem but it still has independent interest.

An operator M on Hn is a rank-1 probability operator if and only if M has a matrix representation [formula] where [formula], [formula], satisfy [formula].

Suppose [formula] with [formula] where [formula]. Let [formula] be the vector [formula]. We have that [formula] so M is positive with rank 1. To show that M is a probability operator we have Conversely, let M be a rank-1 probability operator. Since M is rank-1, it has the form [formula] for some [formula]. We then have the matrix representation where ej, [formula], is the standard basis for [formula]. Letting [formula] we conclude that [formula]. Since M is a probability operator we have that Now there exists a [formula] such that [formula]. Letting ψ' = eiθψ we obtain where α'j = e- iθαj, [formula]. Hence, [formula].

An operator on [formula] is called a qubit operator. We shall only need the following corollary of Theorem [\ref=thm41].

A qubit operator M is a rank-1 probability operator if and only if M has a matrix representation

[formula]

where [formula].

A CAP [formula] is stationary if the coupling constants cn, are independent of j. In this case we write cn, = cn and we have [formula]. By Corollary [\ref=cor42] the operators are qubit rank-1 probability operators.

Let [formula] be the coupling constants for a stationary CAP. The generated CQSGP [formula] has the form

[formula]

Since Ωn  ≈  Pn we can write At the next step we apply Example 3 to obtain

[formula]

Continuing by induction, we have that [\eqref=eq42] holds.

Equation [\eqref=eq42] shows that the (n - 1)-qubit probability operator ρn is the tensor product of n - 1 qubit probability operators. The next result show that the converse of Theorem [\ref=thm43] holds.

If the CQSGP [formula] has the form where βj is a rank-1 probability operator, then [formula] is generated by a stationary CAP.

Since βj, [formula], is a rank-1 qubit probability operator, by Corollary [\ref=cor42] we have that where [formula]. As in the proof of Theorem [\ref=thm43], [formula] is generated by a stationary CAP whose coupling constants are [formula]

We say that a CAP is completely stationary if the coupling constants cn, are independent of n and [formula]. In this case, we have a single coupling constant [formula] and the generated CQSGP [formula] has the form where [formula] has the form [\eqref=eq41].

Examples of Q-Measures

In this section we compute some simple examples of q-measures in the stationary case. Let [formula] be a stationary CAP with corresponding coupling constants [formula]. As usual, we can identify Ωn with Pn. If [formula] we have that μn(ω) = μn(ωn). For [formula] we have a2(x2,0) = c1, a2(x2,1) = 1 - c1, so [formula] and [formula]. For we have a3(x3,0) = c1c2, a3(x3,1) = c1(1 - c2), a3(x3,2) = (1 - c1)c2, a3(x3,3) = (1 - c1)(1 - c2). Hence, [formula], [formula], [formula] and [formula]. We now compute the q-measure of some two element sets. We have that Since [formula] in general, we conclude that x3,0 and x3,1 interfere with other, except in special cases. If we say that x3,0 and x3,1 interfere destructively and if we say that x3,0 and x3,1 interfere constructively. The three possible cases, = , < , >  can occur depending on the value of c2. In a similar way, we have that [formula]

[formula]

It follows that any pair of elements of P3 interfere, in general. Finally, we compute the q-measures of some three element sets:

[formula]

We now consider In this case we have a4(x4,0) = c1c2c3, a4(x4,1) = c1c2(1 - c3), a4(x4,2) = c1(1 - c2)c3, a4(x4,3) = c1(1 - c2)(1 - c3), a4(x4,4) = (1 - c1)c2c3, a4(x4,5) = (1 - c1)c2(1 - c3), a4(x4,6) = (1 - c1)(1 - c2)c3, a4(x4,7) = (1 - c1)(1 - c2)(1 - c3). We then have that [formula], [formula]. In general, the pattern is clear that where c'i = ci if the history of xn,j turns "left" at the ith step and c'i = 1 - ci if it turns "right" at the ith step. Some q-measures of two element sets are

[formula]

In general, any pair of c-causets in P4 interfere.

We now consider the extremal left path [formula]. Is [formula]? We have that Now [formula] if and only if lim μn(xn,0) exists and this depends on the values of cn. In fact, we can set values of cn so that lim μn(xn,0) = r for an [formula]. For example, if we let [formula], then we obtain Moreover, in this case [formula] for every ω∈Ω with similar values for μ(ω).

As another example, let A  ⊆  Ω be the set of paths [formula] such that [formula] are the "middle half" of [formula]. That is, A1  =  P1, A2  =  P, [formula],

[formula]

Now μ1(A1) = μ2(A2) = 1, [formula]

[formula]

It is not a coincidence that μ4(A4) = μ3(A3). In fact, A4 = (A3  →  ) and [formula]. It follows that A∈C(Ω) so A∈S(Ω) with μ(A) = μ3(A3). In a similar way A'∈S(Ω) with [formula]. We can interpret A' as the "one fourth end paths" with A'n = (An)', [formula].

The situation for noncylinder sets is more complicated so to simplify matters we consider a completely stationary CAP. In this case we have only one coupling constant c. For x∈Pn we have that an(x) = cj(1 - c)k where j + k = n - 1, j is the number of "left turns" and k is the number of "right turns." We then have explicitly that

[formula]

The q-measure of x∈Pn becomes It is interesting that in this case we have

[formula]

If [formula], then Whether lim μn(ωn) exists or not depends on c. If [formula] then [formula] for every ω∈Ω and μ(ω) = 0. If [formula], then [formula] for every ω∈Ω. If [formula], [formula] or vice versa, then [formula] for some ω∈Ω and [formula] for others. Except for the trivial cases [formula] or [formula] we have that [formula] whenever [formula]. An interesting example of a set B∉C(Ω) is Thus, [formula] where [formula] is the extremal left path. Then B∉C(Ω) and [formula]. If [formula], then lim μn(Bn) = 1 so B∈S(Ω) with μ(B) = 1.

As a special case, let [formula] be a completely stationary CAP with coupling constant [formula]. This is probably the simplest nontrivial coupling constant. Notice that [formula] and [formula]. Moreover For x∈Pn we have that μn(x) = 1 / 2n - 1. It follows that [formula] for every ω∈Ω and μ(ω) = 0. In a similar way, if A  ⊆  Ω is finite, then A∈S(Ω) and μ(A) = 0. Moreover, A'∈S(Ω) and μ(A') = 1. In P3 we have that so in this case x3,0 and x3,1 do not interfere. In a similar way, [formula] so x3,0 and x3,2 do not interfere. On the other hand, so x3,0 and x3,3 interfere destructively. Also, so x3,1 and x3,2 interfere constructively. Even in this simple case we can get strange results: We can check grade-2 additivity:

[formula]

An interesting property of this special case is that the probability operators [formula] are closely related to the Pauli spin operator In particular, for [formula] we have In this way, ρn corresponds to a state for (n - 1) spin-[formula] particles.

We now consider precluded events for the CAP we are discussing. We say that xn,j,xn,k∈Pn are an antipodal pair if an(xn,j) =  - an(xn,k). Since [formula], j + k = n - 1, we have that for sone [formula]. It follows that xn,j and xn,k are an antipodal pair if and only if for some [formula]. We leave the proof of the following result to the reader. As usual we apply the identity Ωn  ≈  Pn.

A set A  ⊆  Ωn is a nonempty, primitive precluded event if and only if [formula] where xn,j and xn,k are an antipodal pair.

Applying Theorems [\ref=thm51] and [\ref=thm32] we obtain:

A set A  ⊆  Ωn is precluded if and only if A is a disjoint union of antipodal pairs.

According to the coevent formulation [\cite=gtw9] [\cite=sor07] [\cite=sur11] [\cite=wal13], precluded events do not occur so we can remove them from consideration. What is left can occur in some anhomomorphic realization of possible universes [\cite=gtw9] [\cite=sur11] [\cite=wal13]. We can remove a precluded event from Ωn (or Pn) which is as large as possible but there is no unique way of doing this, in general. To illustrate this method let us remove the "left" and "right" precluded extremes. In P3 we remove the precluded event [formula] and we obtain with μ3(A3) = 1. In P4 we remove the precluded event and we obtain with μ4(A4) = 1. In P5 we remove the precluded event and we obtain with μ5(A5) = 1. Continuing this process, we conjecture that we obtain a sequence of events An  ⊆  Ωn where [formula] and μn(An) = 1. Although [formula] increases exponentially, if this conjecture holds then [formula] only increases linearly. This gives a huge reduction for the number of possible universes. If A  ⊆  Ω satisfies An = An then A∈S(Ω) with μ(A) = 1 and A'∈S(Ω) with μ(A') = 0. We would then conclude that A' is precluded and a realizable universe would have to be in A.
